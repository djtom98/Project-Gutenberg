AMBROSE\'S CHOIR.\r\n\r\n  \'For be it known\r\n  That their saint\'s honour is their own.\'--SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Micklethwayte was rising and thriving.  There were\r\nsalubrious springs which an enterprising doctor had lately brought into\r\nnotice.  The firm of Greenleaf and Dutton manufactured umbrellas in\r\nlarge quantities, from the stout weather-proof family roof down to the\r\ndaintiest fringed toy of a parasol.  There were a Guild Hall and a\r\nhandsome Corn Market.  There was a Modern School for the boys, and a\r\nHigh School for the girls, and a School of Art, and a School of\r\nCookery, and National Schools, and a British School, and a Board\r\nSchool, also churches of every height, chapels of every denomination,\r\nand iron mission rooms budding out in hopes to be replaced by churches.\r\n\r\nLike one of the animals which zoologists call radiated, the town was\r\nconstantly stretching out fresh arms along country roads, all living\r\nand working, and gradually absorbing the open spaces between.  One of\r\nthese arms was known as St. Ambrose\'s Road, in right of the church, an\r\nincomplete structure in yellow brick, consisting of a handsome chancel,\r\nthe stump of a tower, and one aisle just weather-tight and usable, but,\r\nby its very aspect, begging for the completion of the beautiful design\r\nthat was suspended above the alms-box.\r\n\r\nIt was the evening of a summer day which had been very hot.  The choir\r\npractice was just over, and the boys came out trooping and chattering;\r\nvery small ones they were; for as soon as they began to sing tolerably\r\nthey were sure to try to get into the choir of the old church, which\r\nhad a foundation that fed, clothed, taught, and finally apprenticed\r\nthem.  So, though the little fellows were clad in surplices and\r\ncassocks, and sat in the chancel for correctness sake, there was a\r\nspace round the harmonium reserved for the more trustworthy band of\r\ngirls and young women who came forth next, followed by four or five\r\nmechanics.\r\n\r\nBehind came the nucleus of the choir--a slim, fair-haired youth of\r\ntwenty; a neat, precise, well-trimmed man, closely shaven, with\r\nstooping shoulders, at least fifteen years older, with a black poodle\r\nat his heels, as well shorn as his master, newly risen from lying\r\noutside the church door; a gentle, somewhat drooping lady in black, not\r\nyet middle-aged and very pretty; a small eager, unformed, black-eyed\r\ngirl, who could hardly keep back her words for the outside of the\r\nchurch door; a tall self-possessed handsome woman, with a fine\r\nclassical cast of features; and lastly, a brown-faced, wiry hardworking\r\nclergyman, without an atom of superfluous flesh, but with an air of\r\ngreat energy.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! vicar, where are we to go?\' was the question so eager to break\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\'Not to the Crystal Palace, Nuttie.  The funds won\'t bear it.  Mr.\r\nDutton says we must spend as little as possible on locomotion.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I don\'t care for the Crystal Palace.  A trumpery tinsel\r\nplace, all shams.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush, hush, my dear, not so loud,\' said the quiet lady; but Nuttie\r\nonly wriggled her shoulders, though her voice was a trifle lowered. \'If\r\nit were the British Museum now, or Westminster Abbey.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or the Alps,\' chimed in a quieter voice, \'or the Ufizzi.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, Mr. Dutton, that\'s not what I want.  Our people aren\'t ready for\r\nthat, but what they have let it be real.  Miss Mary, don\'t you see what\r\nI mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Rather better than Miss Egremont herself,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said the vicar, interposing in the wordy war, \'Mrs. Greenleaf\'s\r\nchildren have scarlatina, so we can\'t go to Horton Bishop.  The choice\r\nseems to be between South Beach and Monks Horton.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s no harm,\' cried Nuttie; \'Mrs. Greenleaf is so patronising!\'\r\n\r\n\'And both that and South Beach are so stale,\' said the youth.\r\n\r\n\'As if the dear sea could ever be stale,\' cried the young girl.\r\n\r\n\'I thought Monks Horton was forbidden ground,\' said Miss Mary.\r\n\r\n\'So it was with the last regime\', said the vicar; \'but now the new\r\npeople are come I expect great things from them.  I hear they are very\r\nfriendly.\'\r\n\r\n\'I expect nothing from them,\' said Nuttie so sententiously that all her\r\nhearers laughed and asked \'her exquisite reason,\' as Mr. Dutton put it.\r\n\r\n\'Lady Kirkaldy and a whole lot of them came into the School of Art.\'\r\n\r\n\'And didn\'t appreciate "Head of Antinous by Miss Ursula Egremont,"\' was\r\nthe cry that interrupted her, but she went on with dignity\r\nunruffled--\'Anything so foolish and inane as their whole talk and all\r\ntheir observations I never heard.  "I don\'t like this style," one of\r\nthem said.  "Such ugly useless things!  I never see anything pretty and\r\nneatly finished such as we used to do."\'  The girl gave it in a tone of\r\nmimicry of the nonchalant voice, adding, with fresh imitation, "\'And\r\nanother did not approve of drawing from the life--models might be such\r\nstrange people."\'\r\n\r\n\'My ears were not equally open to their profanities,\' said Miss Mary.\r\n\'I confess that I was struck by the good breeding and courtesy of the\r\nleader of the party, who, I think, was Lady Kirkaldy herself.\'\r\n\r\n\'I saw!  I thought she was patronising you, and my blood boiled!\' cried\r\nNuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Will boiling blood endure a picnic in the park of so much ignorance,\r\nfolly, and patronage?\' asked Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, indeed, Mr. Dutton, Nuttie never said that,\' exclaimed gentle Mrs.\r\nEgremont.\r\n\r\n\'Whether it is fully worth the doing is the question,\' said the vicar.\r\n\r\n\'Grass and shade do not despise,\' said Miss Mary.\r\n\r\n\'There surely must be some ecclesiastical remains,\' said the young man.\r\n\r\n\'And there is a river,\' added the vicar.\r\n\r\n\'I shall get a stickleback for my aquarium,\' cried Nuttie.  \'We shall\r\nmake some discoveries for the Scientific Society.  I shall note down\r\nevery individual creature I see!  I say! you are sure it is not a sham\r\nwaterfall or Temple of Tivoli?\'\r\n\r\n\'It would please the choir boys and G. F. S. girls quite as much, if\r\nnot more, in that case,\' said Miss Mary; \'but you need not expect that,\r\nNuttie.  Landscape-gardening is gone by.\'\r\n\r\n\'Even with the county people?\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'By at least half a century,\' said Mr. Dutton, \'with all deference to\r\nthis young lady\'s experience.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was out of their own mouths,\' cried the girl defiantly.  \'That\'s\r\nall I know about county people, and so I hope it will be.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come in, my dear, you are talking very fast,\' interposed Mrs.\r\nEgremont, with some pain in the soft sweet voice, which, if it had been\r\na little stronger, would have been the best in the choir.\r\n\r\nThese houses in St. Ambrose\'s Road were semi-detached.  The pair which\r\nthe party had reached had their entrances at the angles, with a narrow\r\ngravel path leading by a tiny grass plat to each.  One, which was\r\ncovered with a rich pall of purple clematis, was the home of Mrs.\r\nEgremont, her aunt, and Nuttie; the other, adorned with a Gloire de\r\nDijon rose in second bloom, was the abode of Mary Nugent, with her\r\nmother, the widow of a naval captain.  Farther on, with adjoining\r\ngardens, was another couple of houses, in one of which lived Mr.\r\nDutton; in the other lodged the youth, Gerard Godfrey, together with\r\nthe partner of the principal medical man.  The opposite neighbours were\r\na master of the Modern School and a scholar.  Indeed, the saying of the\r\nvicar, the Rev. Francis Spyers, was, and St. Ambrose\'s Road was proud\r\nof it, that it was a professional place.  Every one had something to do\r\neither with schools or umbrellas, scarcely excepting the doctor and the\r\nsolicitor, for the former attended the pupils and the latter supplied\r\nthem.  Mr. Dutton was a partner in the umbrella factory, and lived, as\r\nthe younger folk said, as the old bachelor of the Road.  Had he not a\r\nhousekeeper, a poodle, and a cat; and was not his house, with lovely\r\nsill boxes full of flowers in the windows, the neatest of the neat; and\r\ndid not the tiny conservatory over his dining-room window always\r\nproduce the flowers most needed for the altar vases, and likewise\r\nbouquets for the tables of favoured ladies. Why, the very daisies never\r\ndurst lift their heads on his little lawn, which even bore a French\r\nlooking-glass globe in the centre. Miss Nugent, or Miss Mary as every\r\none still called her, as her elder sister\'s marriage was recent, was\r\nassistant teacher at the School of Art, and gave private drawing\r\nlessons, so as to supplement the pension on which her mother lived.\r\nThey also received girls as boarders attending the High School.\r\n\r\nSo did Miss Headworth, who had all her life been one of those people\r\nwho seem condemned to toil to make up for the errors or disasters of\r\nothers.  First she helped to educate a brother, and soon he had died to\r\nleave an orphan daughter to be bred up at her cost.  The girl had\r\nmarried from her first situation; but had almost immediately lost her\r\nhusband at sea, and on this her aunt had settled at Micklethwayte to\r\nmake a home for her and her child, at first taking pupils, but when the\r\nHigh School was set up, changing these into boarders; while Mrs.\r\nEgremont went as daily governess to the children of a family of\r\nsomewhat higher pretensions.  Little Ursula, or Nuttie, as she was\r\ncalled, according to the local contraction, was like the child of all\r\nthe party, and after climbing up through the High School to the last\r\nform, hoped, after passing the Cambridge examination, to become a\r\nteacher there in another year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMONKS HORTON.\r\n\r\n  \'And we will all the pleasures prove,\r\n  By shallow rivers, by whose falls\r\n  Melodious birds sing madrigals.\'--Old Ballad.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was holiday-time, and liberties were taken such as were not\r\npermissible, when they might have afforded a bad precedent to the\r\nboarders.  Therefore, when two afternoons later Mary Nugent, returning\r\nfrom district visiting, came out into her garden behind the house, she\r\nwas not scandalised to see a pair of little black feet under a holland\r\nskirt resting on a laurel branch, and going a few steps more she beheld\r\na big shady hat, and a pair of little hands busy with a pencil and a\r\nblank book; as Ursula sat on the low wall between the gardens, shaded\r\nby the laburnum which facilitated the ascent on her own side.\r\n\r\n\'Oh Miss Mary!  Delicious!  Come up here!  You don\'t know how charming\r\nthis is.\'\r\n\r\nShe moved aside so as to leave the ascent--by an inverted flower-pot\r\nand a laurel branch--open to her friend, thus knocking down one of the\r\npile of books which she had taken to the top of the wall.  Miss Nugent\r\npicked it up, \'Marie Stuart!  Is this your way of studying her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, you know \'tis holiday time, and volunteer work; besides, she was\r\nwaiting for you, and I could not help doing this.\'  She held out a\r\nhand, which was scarcely needed, and Mary sprang lightly to share her\r\nperch upon the wall.  \'Look here!\'\r\n\r\n\'Am I to guess the subject as in the game of historic outlines,\' said\r\nMiss Nugent, as the book was laid on her lap.  \'It looks like a\r\nmodern--no, a mediaeval--edition of Marcus Curtius about to leap into\r\nthe capital opening for a young man, only with his dogs instead of his\r\nhorse.  That hound seems very rationally to object.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now don\'t!  Guess in earnest.\'\r\n\r\n\'A compliment to your name.  The Boy of Egremont, poor fellow, just\r\nabout to bound across the strid.\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly!  I always feel sure that my father must have done something\r\nlike this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Was it so heroic?\' said Miss Mary. \'You know it was for the hundredth\r\ntime, and he had no reason to expect any special danger.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but his mother was waiting, and he had to go.  Now, I\'ll tell you\r\nhow it must have been with my father.  You know he sailed away in a\r\nyacht before I was born, and poor mother never saw him again; but I\r\nknow what happened.  There was a ship on fire like the Birkenhead, and\r\nthe little yacht went near to pick up the people, and my father called\r\nout, like Sir Humphrey Gilbert--\r\n\r\n          "Do not fear, Heaven is as near\r\n           By water as by land."\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the little yacht was so close when the great ship blew up that it\r\ngot sucked down in the whirlpool, and rescuers and all died a noble\r\ndeath together!\'\r\n\r\n\'Has your mother been telling you?\' asked Miss Mary.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no! she never mentions him.  She does not know.  No one does; but I\r\nam quite sure he died nobly, with no one to tell the tale, only the\r\nangels to look on, and that makes it all the finer.  Or just suppose he\r\nwas on a desert island all the time, and came back again to find us!  I\r\nsometimes think he is.\'\r\n\r\n\'What?  When you are _quite sure_ of the other theory?\'\r\n\r\n\'I mean I am quite sure while I am thinking about it, or reading\r\nRobinson Crusoe, or the Swiss Family.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss Mary, has no one ever told you anything about my father?\'\r\n\r\n\'No one.\'\r\n\r\n\'They never tell me.  Mother cries, and aunt Ursula puts on her\r\n"there\'s-an-end-of-it look."  Do you think there is anything they are\r\nwaiting to tell me till I am older?\'\r\n\r\n\'If there were, I am sure you had better not try to find it out\r\nbeforehand.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t think I would do anything of _that sort?_  But I thought you\r\nmight know.  Do you remember their first settling here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Scarcely.  I was a very small child then.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Nugent had a few vague recollections which she did not think it\r\nexpedient to mention.  A dim remembrance rose before her of mysterious\r\nwhisperings about that beautiful young widow, and that it had been said\r\nthat the rector of the Old Church had declared himself to know the\r\nladies well, and had heartily recommended them.  She thought it wiser\r\nonly to speak of having been one of their first scholars, telling of\r\nthe awe Miss Headworth inspired; but the pleasure it was to bring a\r\nlesson to pretty Mrs. Egremont, who always rewarded a good one with a\r\nkiss, \'and she was so nice to kiss--yes, and is.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Ursel and mother both were governesses,\' continued the girl, \'and\r\nyet they don\'t want me to go out.  They had rather I was a teacher at\r\nthe High School.\'\r\n\r\n\'They don\'t want to trust their Little Bear out in the world.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think it is more than that,\' said the girl.  \'I can\'t help thinking\r\nthat he--my father--must have been some one rather grand, with such a\r\nbeautiful name as Alwyn Piercefield Egremont.  Yes; I know it was that,\r\nfor I saw my baptismal certificate when I stood for the scholarship; it\r\nwas Dieppe,--Ursula Alice, daughter of Alwyn Piercefield and Alice\r\nElizabeth Egremont, May 15, 1860.  James Everett--I think he was the\r\nchaplain at Dieppe.\'\r\n\r\nMary Nugent thought it the wisest way to laugh and say: \'You, of all\r\npeople in the world, to want to make out a connection with the\r\naristocracy!\'\r\n\r\n\'True love is different,\' said Ursula.  \'He must have been cast off by\r\nhis family for her sake, and have chosen poverty--\r\n\r\n     "To make the croon a pund, my Alwyn gaed to sea,\r\n      And the croon and the pund, they were baith for me."\'\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Mary did not think a yacht a likely place for the conversion of a\r\ncroon into a pound, and the utter silence of mother and aunt did not\r\nseem to her satisfactory; but she feared either to damp the youthful\r\nenthusiasm for the lost father, or to foster curiosity that might lead\r\nto some painful discovery, so she took refuge in an inarticulate sound.\r\n\r\n\'I think Mr. Dutton knows,\' proceeded Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean to ask him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Catch me!  I know how he would look at me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Slang!  A forfeit!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s holiday time, and the boarders can\'t hear.  There\'s Mr.\r\nDutton\'s door!\'\r\n\r\nThis might in one way be a relief to Miss Nugent, but she did not like\r\nbeing caught upon the wall, and therefore made a rapid descent, though\r\nnot without a moment\'s entanglement of skirt, which delayed her long\r\nenough to show where she had been, as Mr. Dutton was at the same moment\r\nadvancing to his own wall on the opposite side of the Nugent garden.\r\nPerhaps he would have pretended to see nothing but for Nuttie\'s cry of\r\nglee.\r\n\r\n\'You wicked elf,\' said Miss Mary, \'to inveigle people into\r\npredicaments, and then go shouting ho! ho! ho! like Robin Goodfellow\r\nhimself.\'\r\n\r\n\'You should have kept your elevation and dignity like me,\' retorted\r\nUrsula; \'and then you would have had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Dutton\r\nclimbing his wall and coming to our feet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mischievous elves deserve no good news,\' said Mr. Dutton, who was by\r\nno means so venerable that the crossing the wall was any effort or\r\ncompromise of dignity, and who had by this time joined Mary on her\r\ngrass plat.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, what is it!  Are we to go to Monks Horton?\' cried Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Here is a gracious permission from Lord Kirkaldy, the only\r\nstipulations being that no vestiges of the meal, such as sandwich\r\npapers or gooseberry skins, be left on the grass; and that nobody does\r\nany mischief,\' he added in an awful tone of personality.  \'So if I see\r\nanybody rooting up holly trees I shall be bound to interfere.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now, Mr. Dutton, it was only a baby holly in a chink.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only a holly tree!  Just like the giant\'s daughter when she only\r\ncarried off waggon, peasant, oxen, and all in her pinafore.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not longer than my finger now!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, remember, mischief either wanton or scientific is forbidden. You\r\nare to set an example to the choir-boys.\'\r\n\r\n\'Scientific mischief is a fatal thing to rare plants,\' said Mary.\r\n\r\n\'If I\'m not to touch anything, I may as well stay at home,\' pouted\r\nNuttie.\r\n\r\n\'You may gather as many buttercups and daisies as the sweet child\r\npleases,\' said Mr. Dutton; whereupon she threatened to throw her books\r\nat his head.\r\n\r\nMiss Nugent asked how they were to go, and Mr. Dutton explained that\r\nthere was only a quarter of a mile\'s walk from the station; that return\r\ntickets would be furnished at a tariff of fourpence a head; and that\r\nthere would be trains at 1.15 and 7.30.\r\n\r\n\'How hungry the children will be.\'\r\n\r\n\'They will eat all the way.  That\'s the worst of this sort of outing.\r\nThey eat to live and live to eat.\'\r\n\r\n\'At least they don\'t eat at church,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Not since the peppermint day, when Mr. Spyers suspended Dickie Drake,\'\r\nput in Mary.\r\n\r\nAnd the Spa Terrace Church people said it was incense.\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  Nuttie!\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed they did.  Louisa Barnet attacked us about it at school, and I\r\nsaid I wished it had been.  Only they mustn\'t eat peppermint in the\r\ntrain, for it makes mother quite ill.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean that Mrs. Egremont will come?\' exclaimed Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, she shall.  It is not too far, and it will be very good for\r\nher.  I shall make her.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s young England\'s filial duty!\' said Mary.\r\n\r\n\'Why, I know what is good for her, and she always does as "I wish."\'\r\n\r\n\'Beneficent despotism!\' said Mr. Dutton.  \'May I ask if Miss Headworth\r\nis an equally obedient subject.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! Aunt Ursel is very seldom tiresome.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nuttie! Nuttie! my dear,\' and a head with the snows of more than half\r\na century appeared on the other side of the wall, under a cap and\r\nparasol.  \'I am sorry to interrupt you, but it is cool enough for your\r\nmother to go into the town, and I wish you to go with her.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHEIR HUNTING.\r\n\r\n  \'And she put on her gown of green,\r\n  And left her mother at sixteen,\r\n       To marry Peter Bell!\'--WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the shrubberies of Monks Horton were walking a lady somewhat past\r\nmiddle age, but full of activity and vigour, with one of those bright\r\nfaces that never grow old, and with her a young man, a few years over\r\ntwenty, with a grave and almost careworn countenance.\r\n\r\nMore and more confidential waxed the conversation, for the lady was\r\nmaking fresh acquaintance with a nephew seldom seen since he had been\r\nher pet and darling as almost a baby, and he was experiencing the\r\ninexpressible charm of tone and manner that recalled the young mother\r\nhe had lost in early boyhood.\r\n\r\n\'Then your mind is made up,\' she said; \'you are quite right to decide\r\non having a profession; but how does your father take it?\'\r\n\r\n\'He is quite convinced that to repeat my uncle\'s life, dangling on as\r\nheir, would be the most fatal mistake.\'\r\n\r\n\'Assuredly, and all the legal knowledge you acquire is so much in\r\nfavour of your usefulness as the squire.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I ever am the squire, of which I have my doubts.\'\r\n\r\n\'You expect Mr. Egremont to marry?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a future marriage, but one in the past.\'\r\n\r\n\'A private marriage!  Do you suspect it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t suspect it--I know it.  I have been hoping to talk the matter\r\nover with you.  Do you remember our first governess, Miss Headworth?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear Mark, did I not lose at Pera the charms of your infancy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Then neither my mother nor my grandmother ever wrote to you about her?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do remember that it struck me that immunity from governesses was a\r\ncompensation for the lack of daughters.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can you tell me no details,\' said Mark anxiously.  \'Have you no\r\nletters?  It was about the time when Blanche was born, when we were\r\nliving at Raxley.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry to say that our roving life prevented my keeping old\r\nletters.  I have often regretted it.  Let me see, there was one who\r\nboxed May\'s ears.\'\r\n\r\n\'That was long after.  I think it was that woman\'s barbarity that made\r\nmy father marry again, and a very good thing that was.  It was wretched\r\nbefore.  Miss Headworth was in my own mother\'s time.\'\r\n\r\n\'I begin to remember something happening that your mother seemed unable\r\nto write about, and your grandmother said that she had been greatly\r\nupset by "that miserable affair," but I was never exactly told what it\r\nhad been.\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss Headworth came when I was four or five years old.  Edda, as we\r\nused to call her in May\'s language, was the first person who gave me a\r\nsense of beauty.  She had dark eyes and a lovely complexion.  I\r\nremember in after times being silenced for saying, "not so pretty as my\r\nEdda."  I was extremely fond of her, enough to have my small jealousy\r\nexcited when my uncle joined us in our walks, and monopolised her,\r\nturning May and me over to play with his dog!\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Mark, Mr. Egremont is some years older than your father.  He\r\ncould not have been a young man at that time.\'\r\n\r\n\'So much the worse.  Most likely he seemed to her quite paternal. The\r\nnext thing I recollect was our being in the Isle of Wight, we two\r\nchildren, with Miss Headworth and the German nurse, and our being told\r\nof our new sister.  Uncle Alwyn and his yacht were there, and we went\r\non board once or twice.  Then matters became confused with me, I\r\nrecollect a confusion, papa and grandmamma suddenly arriving, everybody\r\nseeming to us to have become very cross, our dear Miss Headworth\r\nnowhere to be found, our attendants being changed, and our being\r\nforbidden to speak of her again.  I certainly never thought of the\r\nmatter till a month ago.  You know my uncle\'s eyes have been much\r\naffected by his illness, and he has made a good deal of use of me. He\r\nhas got a valet, a fellow of no particular country, more Savoyard than\r\nanything else, I fancy.  He is a legacy, like other evils, from the old\r\nGeneral, and seems a sort of necessity to my uncle\'s existence.\r\nGregorio they call him.  He was plainly used to absolute government,\r\nand viewed the coming down amongst us as an assertion of liberty much\r\nagainst his will.  We could see that he was awfully jealous of my\r\nfather and me, and would do anything to keep us out; but providentially\r\nhe can\'t write English decently, though he can speak any language you\r\nplease.  Well, the man and I came into collision about a scamp of a\r\ngroom who was doing intolerable mischief in the village, and whom they\r\nput it on me to get discharged.  On that occasion Mr. Gregorio grew\r\ninsolent, and intimated to me that I need not make so sure of the\r\nsuccession.  He knew that which might make the Chanoine and me change\r\nour note.  Well, my father is always for avoiding rows; he said it was\r\nan unmeaning threat, it was of no use to complain of Gregorio, and we\r\nmust digest his insolence.  But just after, Uncle Alwyn sent me to hunt\r\nup a paper that was missing, and in searching a writing-case I came\r\nupon an unmistakable marriage certificate between Alwyn Piercefield\r\nEgremont and Alice Headworth, and then the dim recollections I told you\r\nof began to return.\'\r\n\r\n\'What did you do?\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought I had better consult my father, expecting to hear that she\r\nwas dead, and that no further notice need be taken of the matter. But\r\nhe was greatly disturbed to hear of the certificate, and would hardly\r\nbelieve me.  He said that some friend of my grandmother had written her\r\nword of goings on at Freshwater between his brother and the young\r\ngoverness, and that they went off at once to put a stop to it, but\r\nfound us left with the German maid, who declared that Miss Headworth\r\nhad gone off with Mr. Egremont in the yacht.  No more was heard of my\r\nuncle for six weeks, and when he came back there was a great row with\r\nthe old General, but he absolutely denied being married.  I am afraid\r\nthat was all the old sinner wished, and they went off together in the\r\nyacht to the West Indies, where it was burnt; but they, as you know,\r\nnever came to England again, going straight off to the Mediterranean,\r\nhaving their headquarters at Sorrento, and cruising about till the\r\nGeneral\'s death ten years ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I once met them at Florence, and thought them two weary pitiable\r\nmen.  One looked at the General as a curious relic of the old buck of\r\nthe Regency days, and compassionated his nephew for having had his life\r\nspoilt by dangling after the old man.  It was a warning indeed, and I\r\nam glad you have profited by it, Mark.\'\r\n\r\n\'He came back, after the old man died, to club life in London, and\r\nseldom has been near the old place; indeed, it has been let till\r\nrecently, and he wants to let it again, but it is altogether too\r\ndilapidated for that without repairs.  So he came down to see about it,\r\nand was taken ill there.  But to return to what my father told me. He\r\nwas shocked to hear of the certificate, for he had implicitly believed\r\nhis brother\'s denial of the marriage, and he said Miss Headworth was so\r\nchildish and simple that she might easily have been taken in by a sham\r\nceremony.  He said that he now saw he had done very wrong in letting\r\nhis mother-in-law take all the letters about "that unhappy business"\r\noff his hands without looking at them, but he was much engrossed by my\r\nmother\'s illness, and, as he said, it never occurred to him as a duty\r\nto trace out what became of the poor thing, and see that she was\r\nprovided for safely.  You know Mrs. Egremont says laissez faire is our\r\nfamily failing, and that our first thought is how _not_ to do it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, utter repudiation of such cases was the line taken by the last\r\ngeneration; and I am afraid my mother would be very severe.\'\r\n\r\n\'Another thing that actuated my father was the fear of getting his\r\nbrother into trouble with General Egremont, as he himself would have\r\nbeen the one to profit by it.  So I do not wonder so much at his\r\nletting the whole drop without inquiry, and never even looking at the\r\nletters, which there certainly were.  I could not get him to begin upon\r\nit with my uncle, but Mrs. Egremont was strongly on my side in thinking\r\nthat such a thing ought to be looked into, and as I had found the paper\r\nit would be best that I should speak.  Besides that there was no\r\nenduring that Gregorio should be pretending to hold us in terror by\r\nsuch hints.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, and has there been a wife and family in a cottage all this time?\'\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Margaret, he has never seen or heard of her since he left her at\r\nDieppe!  Would you believe it, he thinks himself a victim?  He never\r\nmeant more than to amuse himself with the pretty little governess; and\r\nhe took on board a Mr. and Mrs. Houghton to do propriety, shady sort of\r\npeople I imagine, but that she did not know.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have heard of them,\' said Lady Kirkaldy, significantly.\r\n\r\n\'She must have been a kind friend to the poor girl,\' said Mark.  \'On\r\nsome report that Lady de Lyonnais was coming down on her, wrathful and\r\nterrible, the poor foolish girl let herself be persuaded to be carried\r\noff in the yacht, but there Mrs. Houghton watched over her like a\r\ndragon.  She made them put in at some little place in Jersey, put in\r\nthe banns, all unknown to my uncle, and got them married. Each was\r\ntrying to outwit the other, while Miss Headworth herself was quite\r\ninnocent and unconscious, and, I don\'t know whether to call it an\r\nexcuse for Uncle Alwyn or not, but to this hour he is not sure whether\r\nit was a legal marriage, and my father believes it was not, looking on\r\nit as a youthful indiscretion.  He put her in lodgings at Dieppe, under\r\nMrs. Houghton\'s protection, while he returned home on a peremptory\r\nsummons from the General.  He found the old man in such a state of body\r\nand mind as he tries to persuade me was an excuse for denying the whole\r\nthing, and from that time he represents himself as bound hand and foot\r\nby the General\'s tyranny.  He meant to have kept the secret, given her\r\nan allowance, and run over from time to time to see her, but he only\r\ncould get there once before the voyage to the West Indies.  The whole\r\naffair was, as he said, complicated by his debts, those debts that the\r\nestate has never paid off.  The General probably distrusted him, for he\r\ncurtailed his allowance, and scarcely let him out of sight; and he--he\r\nsubmitted for the sake of his prospects, and thinking the old man much\r\nnearer his end than he proved to be.  I declare as I listened, it came\r\nnear to hearing him say he had sold his soul to Satan!  From the day he\r\nsailed in the Ninon he has never written, never attempted any\r\ncommunication with the woman whose life he had wrecked, except one\r\ninquiry at Dieppe, and that was through Gregorio.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! the valet?\'\r\n\r\nYes.  I believe I seemed surprised at such a medium being employed, for\r\nUncle Alwyn explained that the man had got hold of the secret\r\nsomehow--servants always know everything--and being a foreigner he was\r\nlikely to be able to trace her out.\r\n\r\n\'I daresay he profited by the knowledge to keep Alwyn in bondage during\r\nthe old man\'s lifetime.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have no doubt of it, and he expected to play the same game with me.\r\nThe fellow reminds me, whenever I look at him, of a sort of incarnate\r\nfamiliar demon.  When I asked my uncle whether he could guess what had\r\nbecome of her, he held up his hands with a hideous French grimace.  I\r\ncould have taken him by the throat.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, one must pity him.  The morals of George IV.\'s set had been\r\nhanded on to him by the General,\' said Lady Kirkaldy, rejoicing in the\r\ngenuine indignation of the young face, free from all taint of vice, if\r\nsomewhat rigid.  \'And what now?\'\r\n\r\n\'He assured me that he could make all secure to my father and me, as if\r\nthat were the important point; but finally he perceived that we had no\r\nright to stand still without endeavouring to discover whether there be\r\na nearer heir, and my father made him consent to my making the search,\r\ngrinning at its Quixotism all the time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you done anything?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  I have been to Jersey, seen the register--July 20, 1859--and an\r\nold French-speaking clerk, who perfectly recollected the party coming\r\nfrom the yacht, and spoke of her as tres belle.  I have also\r\nascertained that there is no doubt of the validity of the marriage.\r\nThen, deeply mistrusting Master Gregorio, I went on to Dieppe, where I\r\nentirely failed to find any one who knew or remembered anything about\r\nthem--there is such a shifting population of English visitors and\r\nresidents, and it was so long ago.  I elicited from my uncle that she\r\nhad an aunt, he thought, of the same name as herself; but my father\r\ncannot remember who recommended her, or anything that can be a clue.\r\nHas any one looked over my grandmother\'s letters?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think not.  My brother spoke of keeping them till I came to London.\r\nThat might give a chance, or the Houghtons might know about her.  I\r\nthink my husband could get them hunted up.  They are sure to be at some\r\ncontinental resort.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s that?\' as a sound of singing was heard.\r\n\r\n\'"Auld Langsyne."  The natives are picnicking in the ravine below\r\nthere.  They used to be rigidly excluded, but we can\'t stand that; and\r\nthis is the first experiment of admitting them on condition that they\r\ndon\'t make themselves obnoxious.\'\r\n\r\n\'Which they can\'t help.\'\r\n\r\n\'We have yet to see if this is worse than an Austrian or Italian\r\nfestival.  See, we can look down from behind this yew tree.  It really\r\nis a pretty sight from this distance.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s the cleric heading his little boys and their cricket, and\r\nthere are the tuneful party in the fern on the opposite side.  They\r\nhave rather good voices, unless they gain by distance.\'\r\n\r\n\'And there\'s a girl botanising by the river.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sentimentalising over forget-me-nots, more likely.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear Mark, for a specimen of young England, you are greatly\r\nbehindhand in perception of progress!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! you are used to foreigners, Aunt Margaret.  You have never\r\nfathomed English vulgarity.\'\r\n\r\n\'It would serve you right to send you to carry the invitation to go\r\nround the gardens and houses.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean it, aunt?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mean it?  Don\'t you see your uncle advancing down the\r\nroad--there--accosting the clergyman--what\'s his name--either Towers or\r\nSpires--something ecclesiastical I know.  We only waited to reconnoitre\r\nand see whether the numbers were unmanageable.\'\r\n\r\n\'And yet he does not want to sit for Micklethwayte?\'\r\n\r\n\'So you think no one can be neighbourly except for electioneering! O\r\nMark, I must take you in hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'Meantime the host is collecting.  I abscond.  Which is the least showy\r\npart of the establishment?\'\r\n\r\n\'I recommend the coal cellar--\'and, as he went off--\'poor boy, he is a\r\ndear good fellow, but how little he knows how to be laughed at!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA NAME.\r\n\r\n  \'Sigh no more lady, lady sigh no more,\r\n    Men were deceivers ever,\r\n  One foot on sea and one on land--\r\n    To one thing constant never.\'--Old Ballad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'So you have ventured out again,\' said Lady Kirkaldy, as her nephew\r\nstrolled up to her afternoon tea-table under a great cedar tree:\r\n\r\n\'The coast being clear, and only distant shouts being heard in the\r\nravine--\r\n\r\n          \'"Like an army defeated\r\n            The choir retreated;\r\n            And now doth fare well\r\n            In the valley\'s soft swell,"\'\r\n\r\nsaid the aunt.\r\n\r\n\'At least you have survived; or is this the reaction,\' said the nephew,\r\nputting on a languid air.\r\n\r\n\'There were some very nice people among them, on whom the pictures were\r\nby no means thrown away.  What would you say, Mark, if I told you that\r\nI strongly suspect that I have seen your lost aunt?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense!\' cried Mark, as emphatically as disrespectfully.\r\n\r\n\'I am not joking in the least,\' said Lady Kirkaldy, looking up at him.\r\n\'I heard the name of Egremont, and made out that it belonged to a very\r\nlady-like pretty-looking woman in gray and white; she seemed to be\r\ntrying to check and tame a bright girl of eighteen or so, who was in a\r\nperfect state of rapture over the Vandykes.  I managed to ask the\r\nclergyman who the lady was, and he told me she was a Mrs. Egremont, who\r\nlives with her aunt, a Miss Headworth, who boards girls for the High\r\nSchool; very worthy people, he added.\'\r\n\r\n\'Headworth?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'But if it were, she would have known your name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hardly.  The title had not come in those days; and if she heard of us\r\nat all it would be as Kerrs.  I ventured further to put out a feeler by\r\nasking whether he knew what her husband had been, and he said he\r\nbelieved he had been lost at sea, but he, Mr. Spyers I mean, had only\r\nbeen at Micklethwayte three or four years, and had merely known her as\r\na widow.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose it is worth following up,\' said Mark, rather reluctantly. \'I\r\nwish I had seen her.  I think I should know Miss Headworth again, and\r\nshe would hardly know me.\'\r\n\r\n\'You see what comes of absconding.\'\r\n\r\n\'After all, it was best,\' said Mark.  \'Supposing her to be the real\r\nwoman, which I don\'t expect, it might have been awkward if she had\r\nheard my name!  How can we ascertain the history of this person without\r\ncommitting ourselves?\'\r\n\r\nLord Kirkaldy, an able man, who had been for many years a diplomatist,\r\nhere joined the party, and the whole story was laid before him.  He was\r\nnew to Micklethwayte, having succeeded a somewhat distant kinsman, and\r\ndid not know enough of the place to be able to fix on any one to whom\r\nto apply for information; but the result of the consultation was that\r\nLady Kirkaldy should go alone to call on Miss Headworth, and explain\r\nthat she was come to inquire about a young lady of the same name, who\r\nhad once been governess to the children of her sister, Lady Adelaide\r\nEgremont.  Mark was rather a study to his uncle and aunt all the\r\nevening.  He was as upright and honourable as the day, and not only\r\nacted on high principle, but had a tender feeling to the beautiful\r\nplayfellow governess, no doubt enhanced by painful experiences of\r\nsuccessors chosen for their utter dissimilarity to her.  Still it was\r\nevidently rather flat to find himself probably so near the tangible\r\ngoal of his romantic search; and the existence of a first cousin had\r\nbeen startling to him, though his distaste was more to the taking her\r\nfrom second-rate folk in a country town than to the overthrow of his\r\nown heirship.  At least so he manifestly and honestly believed, and\r\nknowing it to be one of those faiths that make themselves facts, the\r\nKirkaldys did not disturb him in it, nor commiserate him for a loss\r\nwhich they thought the best thing possible for him.\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth was accustomed to receive visitors anent boarders, so\r\nwhen Lady Kirkaldy\'s card was brought to her, the first impression was\r\nthat some such arrangement was to be made.  She was sitting in her\r\npretty little drawing-room alone, for Nuttie and her mother had gone\r\nout for a walk with Miss Nugent.\r\n\r\nThe room, opening on the garden, and cool with blinds, had a certain\r\nhomely grace about the faded furniture.  The drawings on the walls were\r\ngood, the work quaint and tasteful.  There was a grand vase of\r\nfoxgloves before the empty grate, and some Marshal Nial roses in a\r\nglass on the table.  The old lady herself--with alert black eyes and a\r\nsweet expression--rose from her chair in the window to receive her\r\nguest.\r\n\r\nLady Kirkaldy felt reassured as to the refinement of the surroundings,\r\nand liked the gentle but self-possessed tones of the old lady.  She\r\nnoticed the foxgloves.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Miss Headworth, \'they are the fruits of yesterday\'s\r\nexpedition.  My two children, as I call them, brought them home in\r\ntriumph.  I cannot tell you what pleasure Lord Kirkaldy\'s kindness gave\r\nthem--and many more.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am glad,\' said the lady, while she said to herself, \'now for it,\'\r\nand sat forward.  \'It struck me,\' she said, \'on hearing your name that\r\nyou might be related to--to a young lady who lived a good while ago in\r\nthe family of my sister, Lady Adelaide Egremont.\'\r\n\r\nA strange look came into Miss Headworth\'s eyes, her lips trembled, she\r\nclutched tightly the arm of her chair, but then cast a puzzled glance\r\nat her visitor.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps if you heard of me then,\' said the latter, \'it was as Lady\r\nMargaret Kerr.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Miss Headworth, then pausing, she collected herself and\r\nsaid in an anxious voice,  \'Do I understand that your ladyship is come\r\nto inquire for my niece, being aware of the circumstances.\'\r\n\r\n\'I only became aware of them yesterday,\' said Lady Kirkaldy.  \'I was in\r\nTurkey at the time, and no particulars were given to me; but my nephew,\r\nMark Egremont, your niece\'s old pupil, came to consult us, having just\r\ndiscovered among his uncle\'s papers evidence of the marriage, of which\r\nof course he had been ignorant.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then,\' exclaimed Miss Headworth, holding her hands tightly clasped,\r\n\'Shall I really see justice done at last to my poor child?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is young Mark\'s most earnest wish and his father--\'Lady Kirkaldy\r\nhesitated for a word, and Miss Headworth put in:\r\n\r\n\'His father!  Why would he never even acknowledge either Alice\'s\r\nletters or mine?  We wrote several times both to him and Lady Adelaide,\r\nand never received any reply, except one short one, desiring he might\r\nnot be troubled on such a subject.  It was cruel! Alice said it was not\r\nin his writing.  She had done very wrong, and the family might well be\r\noffended, but a poor child like her, just eighteen, might have been\r\ntreated with some pity.\'\r\n\r\n\'My sister was in declining health.  He was very much engrossed.  He\r\nleft the matter to--to others,\' said Lady Kirkaldy.  \'He is very sorry\r\nnow that he acquiesced in what was then thought right.  He did not then\r\nknow that there had been a marriage.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought in that case a clergyman would have been bound\r\nto show the more compassion.\'\r\n\r\nLady Kirkaldy knew that the cruel silence had been chiefly the work of\r\nthe stem Puritan pitilessness of her mother, so she passed this over,\r\nsaying, \'We are all very anxious to atone, as far as possible, for what\r\nis past, but we know little or nothing, only what my nephew Mark has\r\nbeen able to gather.\'\r\n\r\n\'Little Mark!  Alice always talked of him with great affection.  How\r\npleased she will be to hear of his remembering her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Would you object to telling me what you know of this history?\' said\r\nLady Kirkaldy.  \'I am afraid it is very painful to you, but I think we\r\nshould understand it clearly.  Please speak to me as a friend, as woman\r\nto woman.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your ladyship is very kind,\' said the poor old lady.  \'I have only\r\nmentioned the subject once since we came to settle here, seventeen\r\nyears ago, but such things one cannot forget.  If you will excuse me, I\r\nhave some dates that will assist my accuracy.\'\r\n\r\nShe hurried away, and came back in a few moments, having evidently\r\ndried some tears, perhaps of thankfulness, but she paused as if\r\nreluctant to begin.\r\n\r\n\'I think your niece had no nearer relation than yourself,\' said Lady\r\nKirkaldy, anxious to set her off and at ease.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, or she never would have been so treated.  She was an orphan. My\r\npoor brother was a curate.  He married--as young men will--on\r\ninsufficient means, his strength gave way, and he died of diphtheria\r\nwhen this poor child was only two years old.  Indeed, two little ones\r\ndied at the same time, and the mother married again and went to\r\nShanghai.  She did not long live there, poor thing, and little Alice\r\nwas sent home to me.  I thought I did my best for her by keeping her at\r\na good school.  I have often wished that I had given up my situation,\r\nand become an assistant there, so as to have her more under my own\r\neyes; but I fancied it important to receive a salary out of which I\r\ncould save.  I am wearying your ladyship, but I can\'t but dwell on the\r\nexcuses for my poor child.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed I wish to hear all the details,\' was the sincere and gentle\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\'I had her with me generally in the holidays, and I confess I was\r\nabsolutely alarmed to see how pretty the child was growing, knowing how\r\ngreat a disadvantage it often is.  She was always a good girl, not\r\nnaturally so studious as could be wished, but docile, merry, gentle, a\r\nfavourite with every one, and peculiarly innocent and childish.  I\r\nwished her to remain a few years longer as teacher, but it so happened\r\nthat Lady Adelaide Egremont, coming to consult the head of the\r\nestablishment about a nursery-governess, saw Alice, and was so much\r\nstruck with her sweet face, which was all sunshine then, as to insist\r\non engaging her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! my dear sister, I remember her enthusiastic letter about her\r\npretty governess, and her boy\'s affection for her, an affection that\r\nhas lasted--\'\r\n\r\n\'It seemed so safe.  A clergyman\'s family in the country, and so kind a\r\nlady at the head, that, though Alice had been educated for a superior\r\ngoverness, it appeared the best beginning she could have. And she was\r\nvery happy, and met with great kindness.  Only, unfortunately, Lady\r\nAdelaide was delicate, and for many weeks entirely confined to the\r\nsofa.  Mr. Egremont\'s elder brother was much there.  He seemed to my\r\npoor inexperienced child quite elderly, and his attentions like those\r\nof--of an old uncle--she told me afterwards--\'\r\n\r\n\'He must really have been over forty--\'\r\n\r\n\'No doubt my poor Alice was unguarded.  We know what a merry, happy,\r\nchildish girl may be, but I never heard that her conduct was even\r\ncensured while she remained at Baxley, though I find that Captain\r\nEgremont used to join them in their walks, under pretext of playing\r\nwith the children.  Then she was sent to Freshwater with the two eldest\r\nchildren during Lady Adelaide\'s confinement, and there, most\r\nunjustifiably, Captain Egremont continually visited them from his\r\nyacht, and offered to take them out in it.  Alice knew she ought not to\r\ngo without a married lady on board, and he brought a Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHoughton to call, who were very kind and caressing to her and the\r\nchildren, so that she thought all was right.  Oh! Lady Kirkaldy, I\r\ndon\'t mean to defend her, I daresay she was very giddy and silly, she\r\nreproaches herself, poor dear, but I do say that a wicked advantage was\r\ntaken of her innocence and ignorance.  She says that she had begun to\r\ngrow a little uneasy at the way people looked when Captain Egremont\r\njoined them on the beach; and the nurse, a German, said something that\r\nshe could not understand.  On the 1st of July--yes--but I have the date\r\nhere--came a telegram to the hotel to have rooms for Lady de Lyonnais\r\nand Mr. Egremont ready by the evening.  The whole place knew it, and\r\nsome meddling person burst on Alice with the news, roughly and coarsely\r\ngiven, that they were coming to call her to account for her goings on.\r\nCaptain Egremont found her crying in the utmost terror, and--she really\r\nhardly knew what he said to her--she thinks he offered to shelter her\r\non board the Ninon, from Lady de Lyonnais\' first wrath while he and\r\nMrs. Houghton explained matters; but she cannot tell, for she lost her\r\nsenses with fright, only knew that he was kind and sweet to her in her\r\ndistress, and thought only of escaping.  Well, I don\'t excuse her.  Of\r\ncourse it was the most terrible and fatal thing she could have done,\r\nand--\' The good old lady was quite overcome, and Lady Kirkaldy had\r\ntears in her eyes as she said,\r\n\r\n\'It was frightful folly--but she was guarded.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, her innocence was guarded, thank God,\' said Miss Headworth\r\nfervently.  \'You see she did know that Mr. and Mrs. Houghton were on\r\nboard, and Mrs. Houghton was a truly kind protector who deserved her\r\nconfidence, though, poor lady, she admitted to me that her own conduct\r\nhad not been-strictly correct.\'\r\n\r\n\'How long was it before you heard of her?\'\r\n\r\n\'There was a dreadful letter from Mr. Egremont enclosing what was due\r\nof her salary, and then I heard no more for seven months.  I went to\r\nthe Isle of Wight and made all inquiries, but the nurse and children\r\nhad gone away immediately, and I could obtain no trace of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then she--your niece, never wrote.\'\r\n\r\n\'She was afraid, poor dear.  She had never been at her ease with me.\r\nHer mother had taught her to think me strict and harsh, and she had\r\nnever opened to me in those days.  Besides, he had forbidden her.  At\r\nlast, however, in January, came a letter from this Mrs. Houghton,\r\ntelling me that my Alice was very unwell at Dieppe, that nothing had\r\nbeen heard of her husband, Captain Egremont, to whom she had been\r\nmarried on the 20th of July at St. Philippe, in Jersey, and that she\r\nherself was obliged to leave the place almost immediately; but she\r\nwould, if possible, wait till my arrival, as Mrs. Egremont was not in a\r\ncondition to be left alone.  My dear friends, with whom I was then\r\nliving, were as kind as possible, and set me free to go.  I was there\r\nin three days, and truly the dear, beautiful, merry girl I had parted\r\nwith only a year before was a sad piteous sight.  Mrs. Houghton seemed\r\nbroken-hearted at leaving her, thinking there was little chance of her\r\nliving; but Mr. Houghton, who, I am afraid, was a professed gambler,\r\nhad got into some scrape, and was gone to Paris, where she had to\r\nfollow him.  She told me all about it, and how, when Captain Egremont\r\nfancied that a marriage in the Channel Islands was one he could play\r\nfast and loose with, she had taken care that the formalities should be\r\nsuch as to make all secure.  Foolish and wrong as poor Alice had been,\r\nshe had awakened all the best side of that poor woman\'s nature, and no\r\nmother could have been more careful and tender.  She gave me the\r\ncertificate--here it is--and assured me that it would hold good.  I\r\nhave shown it to a lawyer, and he said the same; but when I sent a copy\r\nto Mr. Egremont, my letter was returned unopened.\'\r\n\r\n\'Captain Egremont had denied the marriage, and they believed him,\' said\r\nLady Kirkaldy.  \'It is hard to believe that he could be so heartless,\r\nbut he was in bondage to the old General Egremont, and dreaded losing\r\nhis inheritance.\'\r\n\r\n\'So he told them in his one visit to Dieppe.  He said he must keep his\r\nmarriage secret, but promised an allowance, on condition that Alice\r\nwould live quietly at Dieppe, and not communicate with any one of her\r\nown family or his.  He had left \xa3100 with her, but that was nearly\r\ngone, and she had never heard from him.  It had preyed on her, and she\r\nwas so ill that I never expected, any more than Mrs. Houghton, to see\r\nher recover.  I stayed there with her; she could not be moved, even if\r\nshe would have consented, when she was continually expecting him; but\r\nat last--four days after her little girl was born--came the news of the\r\nNinon having been burnt, with all on board, three months before.  Do\r\nyou know, strange to say, though I had feared so much to tell her, she\r\nbegan to revive from that time.  The suspense and watching were over.\r\nShe saw that he had not deserted her, and believed that he had loved\r\nher to the last.  She cried a great deal, but it was in a peaceful,\r\nnatural way.  I wrote then, as I had already written, to Lady Adelaide\r\nand to Mr. Egremont, but was not answered.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can account for that,\' said Lady Kirkaldy.  \'My sister had been\r\nordered to Madeira in the autumn, and there they remained till her\r\ndeath in May.  All the letters were sent to my mother, and she did not\r\nthink fit to forward, or open, any bearing on the subject.  In the\r\nmeantime Mr. Egremont was presented to the family living, and on his\r\nreturn moved to Bridgefield Egremont.  And you came here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course I could not part with my poor Alice again.  Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFordyce, whose daughter I had long ago educated, had always kept up a\r\ncorrespondence with me, and, knowing all the story, proposed to me to\r\ncome here.  He was then rector of the old church, and by their help and\r\nrecommendation, with such capital as I had, we were able to begin a\r\nlittle school; and though that has had to give way to the High School,\r\nwhat with boarders, and with Alice\'s employment as daily governess, we\r\nhave, I am thankful to say, gone on very well and comfortably, and my\r\ndear child has recovered her cheerfulness, though she can never be\r\nquite what--I think she was meant to be,\' said the old lady, with a sad\r\nsmile, \'though perhaps she is something better.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think she was absolutely convinced of his death?\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean that he is alive?\' exclaimed Miss Headworth in dismay.\r\n\'Oh! he is a wickeder man than even I supposed, to have forsaken her\r\nall these years.  Is my poor child in his power?  Must her peace, now\r\nshe has attained it, be disturbed?\'\r\n\r\n\'There is a great deal to take into consideration,\' said Lady Kirkaldy.\r\n\'I had better tell you how this visit of mine came about, and explain\r\nsome matters about the Egremont family.\'\r\n\r\nShe then told how Captain Egremont, after a brief service in the Life\r\nGuards, had been made to retire, that the old General, whose heir he\r\nwas, might keep him in attendance on him.  Already self-indulgent and\r\nextravagant, the idleness of the life he led with the worn-out old roue\r\nhad deadened his better feelings, and habituated him to dissipation,\r\nwhile his debts, his expensive habits, and his dread of losing the\r\ninheritance, had bound him over to the General.  Both had been saved\r\nfrom the fire in the Ninon, whence they were picked up by a Chilian\r\nvessel, and they had been long in communicating with home. The General\r\nhated England, and was in broken health.  He had spent the remaining\r\nyears of his life at various continental resorts, where he could enjoy\r\na warm climate, combined with facilities for high play.\r\n\r\nWhen at length, he died, Captain Egremont had continued the life to\r\nwhich he had become accustomed, and had of late manifested an\r\nexpectation that his nephew Mark should play the same part by him as he\r\nhad done by the General, but the youth, bred in a very different tone,\r\nwould on no account thus surrender himself to an evil bondage. Indeed\r\nhe felt all the severity of youthful virtue, and had little toleration\r\nfor his uncle\'s ways of thinking; though, when the old man had come\r\nhome ill, dejected, and half blind, he had allowed himself to be made\r\nuseful on business matters.  And thus he had discovered the marriage,\r\nand had taken up the cause with the ardour stimulated by a chivalrous\r\nfeeling for the beautiful vision of his childhood, whose sudden\r\ndisappearance had ended his brightest days.\r\n\r\n\'I suppose it is right and generous of the young man,\' said Miss\r\nHeadworth.  \'But since the--the man is alive, I wish my poor Alice\r\ncould have been left at peace!\'\r\n\r\n\'You forget that her daughter has rights which must be taken into\r\nconsideration.\'\r\n\r\n\'Little Nuttie!  Dear child!  I should so far like her to be provided\r\nfor, so far as that she need not go out in the world to earn her own\r\nlivelihood.  But no! better be as we are than accept anything from that\r\nman!\'\r\n\r\n\'I quite understand and respect your feeling, Miss Headworth,\' returned\r\nthe lady; \'but may I return to my question whether you think your niece\r\nhas any doubt of her husband being dead.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth considered.  \'Since you ask me, I think she has kept the\r\npossibility of the life before her.  We have never mentioned the\r\nsubject, and, as I said, the belief in his death ended a great suspense\r\nand sense of wounded affection.  She began soon and vigorously to turn\r\nher attention to the support of her child, and has found a fair measure\r\nof happiness; but at the same time she has shrunk from all notice and\r\nsociety, more than would be natural in so very young a widow and so\r\nattractive, more than I should have expected from her original\r\ncharacter.  And once, when she did apprehend symptoms of admiration,\r\nshe insisted that I should tell the history, enough, as she said, to\r\nmake it plain that it was impossible.  There was one night too, when\r\nshe had scarlatina, and was a little lightheaded, only four years ago,\r\nwhen she talked a good deal about his coming back; but that might have\r\nbeen only the old impression on her brain, of that long watching at\r\nDieppe.  He--Captain Egremont, does not yet know where she is?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, certainly not.  But I fear he must.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose he ought,\' sighed Miss Headworth; \'but in the meantime, till\r\nwe know what line he takes, surely she need not be unsettled by the\r\nknowledge of his existence.\'\r\n\r\n\'By no means.  You had better act as you think best about that.  But\r\nyou will not object to my nephew, her old pupil, Mark, coming to see\r\nher?  I will make him promise not to enter upon the subject.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth had only time to make a sign of reluctant acquiescence\r\nwhen the door opened and mother and daughter came in.  Nuttie first,\r\neager as usual and open-mouthed, unaware that any one was there, for\r\nLady Kirkaldy, wishing to avoid talk and observation, had left her\r\ncarriage at the livery stables, and walked to St. Ambrose Road.  The\r\ngirl, whom in a moment she classed as small, dark, and oddly like May\r\nEgremont, stopped short at sight of a stranger; the mother would have\r\nretreated but for Miss Headworth\'s nervous call \'Alice, my dear, here\r\nis Lady Kirkaldy.\'\r\n\r\nVery lovely was Lady Kirkaldy\'s impression as she saw a slender figure\r\nin a dark gray linen dress, and a face of refined, though not\r\nintellectual, beauty and sweetness, under a large straw hat with a good\r\ndeal of white gauziness about it, and the curtsey was full of natural\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\n\'You do not know me,\' said Lady Kirkaldy, taking her hand, \'but I am\r\naunt to some former pupils of yours, one of whom, Mark Egremont, is\r\nvery anxious to come and see you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mark!  My dear little Mark,\' and her face lighted up.  \'How very kind\r\nof him.  But he is not little Mark now.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is not a very big Mark either.  Most of the Egremonts are small. I\r\nsee your daughter takes after them,\' said Lady Kirkaldy, shaking hands\r\nwith Ursula, who looked at her in unmitigated amazement.\r\n\r\nAlice faltered something about Lady Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\'My dear sister fell into a decline, and died while the three children\r\nwere still babies.  Poor things, I believe they had a sad time till\r\ntheir father married a Miss Condamine, who has been an excellent\r\nstepmother to them.  I have been to see them, but Mark was not then at\r\nhome, so he has come to me at Monks Horton.  When will he find you at\r\nhome?  Or may I bring him in at once.  He was to meet me at\r\nMicklethwayte.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like very much to see him,\' was the answer.  And Miss\r\nHeadworth was obliged to say something about her ladyship taking a cup\r\nof tea.  Lady Kirkaldy, knowing that Mark was on the watch, set off in\r\nsearch of him, and found him, as she expected, pacing the pavement in\r\nfront of the church.  There was no great distance in which to utter her\r\nexplanations and cautions, warning him of her promise that the\r\nintelligence of the husband\'s being alive was to be withheld for a\r\nfitter time, but he promised dutifully, and his aunt then took him in\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of her claims was a less stunning shock to Alice\r\nEgremont than to her aunt.  Shielded by her illness, as well as by her\r\nsimplicity and ignorance, she had never been aware of her aunt\'s\r\nattempted correspondence with the Egremonts, nor of their deafness to\r\nappeals made on her behalf.  Far less had it ever occurred to her that\r\nthe validity of her marriage could be denied, and the heinous error of\r\nher elopement seemed to her quite sufficient to account for her having\r\nbeen so entirely cast off by the family.  The idea that as wife or\r\nwidow she had any claims on them, or that Ursula might have rights\r\nabove those of Mark, had not come into her mind, which, indeed, at the\r\nmoment was chiefly occupied by the doubt whether the milk was come in,\r\nand by ordering in the best teacups, presented by the boarders.\r\n\r\nThus she was in the passage when Mark entered, and his exclamation\r\ninstantly was \'Oh, Edda, dear old Edda!  You aren\'t a bit altered!\' and\r\nhe put his head under her hat and kissed her, adding, as she seemed\r\nrather startled, \'You are my aunt, you know; and where\'s my cousin?\r\nYou are Ursula?\'\r\n\r\nHe advanced upon Nuttie, took her by the hand and kissed her forehead\r\nbefore she was aware, but she flashed at him with her black eyes, and\r\nlooked stiff and defiant.  She had no notion of kisses to herself,\r\nstill less to her pretty mother whom she protected with a half proud,\r\nhalf jealous fondness.  How could the man presume to call her by that\r\nfoolish name?  However, that single effusion had exhausted Mark\'s\r\npowers of cordiality, or else Nuttie\'s stiffness froze him.  They were\r\nall embarrassed, and had reason to be grateful to Lady Kirkaldy\'s\r\npractised powers as a diplomate\'s wife.  She made the most of Mrs.\r\nEgremont\'s shy spasmodic inquiries, and Mark\'s jerks of information,\r\nsuch as that they were all living at Bridgefield Egremont, now, that\r\nhis sister May was very like his new cousin, that Blanche was come out\r\nand was very like his mother, etc. etc.  Every one was more at ease\r\nwhen Lady Kirkaldy carried the conversation off to yesterday\'s\r\nentertainment, hoping no one had been overtired, and the like.  Mrs.\r\nEgremont lighted up a little and began telling some of the expressions\r\nof delight she had heard, and in the midst, Nuttie, waking from her\r\ntrance of stiff displeasure, came plump in with \'Oh! and there\'s a\r\nwater-soldier, a real Stratiotes aculeatus in your lake.  May we get\r\nit?  Mr. Dutton didn\'t think we ought, but it would be such a prize!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ursula means a rare water-plant,\' said Mrs. Egremont gently, seeing\r\nthat Lady Kirkaldy had no notion of the treasure she possessed.  \'She\r\nand some of her friends are very eager botanists.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure you may,\' said the lady, amused.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you!  Then, O mother!  Miss Mary and I will go.  And we\'ll wait\r\ntill after office hours, and then Gerard Godfrey can come and fish it\r\nout for us!  Oh, thank you.  He wants the pattern of the Abbot\'s cross\r\nfor an illumination, and he can get some ferns for the church.\'\r\n\r\nSoon after this ebullition, Lady Kirkaldy carried off her nephew, and\r\nhis first utterance outside the door was \'A woman like that will be the\r\nsalvation of my uncle.\'\r\n\r\n\'Firstly, if you can bring them together,\' said his aunt; \'and\r\nsecondly, if there is stuff enough in that pretty creature.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSUSPENSE.\r\n\r\n  \'Where shall the traitor rest\r\n  He, the deceiver?\'--SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Headworth\'s peace of mind was utterly destroyed.  That the\r\nniece whom she had nursed back to life and happiness, and brought to\r\nlove her as a mother, should be at the mercy of a man whom she looked\r\non as a heartless profligate, was dreadful to her beyond measure. And\r\nit involved Ursula\'s young life likewise?  Could it be a duty, after\r\nthese eighteen years, to return to him?  What legal rights had he to\r\nenforce the resumption of the wife he had deserted.  \'I will consult\r\nMr. Dutton,\' said the old lady to herself; \'Mr. Dutton is the only\r\nperson who knows the particulars.  He will give me the best advice.\'\r\n\r\nAnd while Miss Headworth, over her evening toilette, was coming to this\r\nresolution in one bedroom, Nuttie, in another, was standing aghast at\r\nher mother\'s agitation, and receiving a confession which filled her\r\nwith astonishment.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t think why that gentleman should go and be so affectionate all\r\non a sudden, \'quoth Nuttie;\' if he is my cousin, and so fond of you,\r\nwhy couldn\'t he have come to see us before?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Nuttie, dear, you don\'t understand why it is so good of him!  My\r\ndear, now this has come, I must tell you--you must hear--the sad thing\r\nyour mother did.  Yes, my dear, I was their governess--and--and I did\r\nnot--In short, my dear, I eloped.\'\r\n\r\n\'You, mother!  Oh what fun!\' cried the girl in the utter extremity of\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n\'Nuttie!\' exclaimed Mrs. Egremont, in a tone of horror and\r\nindignation--nay, of apprehension.\r\n\r\n\'O mother--I didn\'t mean that!  But I can\'t get to believe it.  You,\r\nlittle mother mine, you that are so timid and bashful and quiet. That\r\nyou--you should have done such a thing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nuttie, my dear, can\'t you understand that such a thing would make me\r\nquiet?  I am always feeling when I see people, or they bring their\r\ndaughters here.  "If they only knew--"\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, no!  They would still see you were the sweetest dear.  But\r\ntell me all about it.  How very much in love you must have been!\' said\r\nNuttie, a magnificent vision of a young sailor with curly hair and open\r\nthroat rising before her.\r\n\r\n\'I think I was more frightened than in love,\' faintly said Mrs.\r\nEgremont.  \'At least I didn\'t know it was love, I thought he was only\r\nkind to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you liked it?\' said Ursula magisterially.\r\n\r\n\'I liked it, oh, I liked it!  It gave me a feeling such as nothing else\r\never did, but I never thought of its being love, he was so much older.\'\r\n\r\n\'Older!\' exclaimed Nuttie, much taken aback.  \'Oh! as old as Mr.\r\nDutton?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Dutton is thirty-six, I think.  Yes, he was older than that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother, how could you?\'  For to be older than Mr. Dutton seemed to the\r\nyouthful fancy to be near decrepitude; but she added, \'I suppose he was\r\nvery noble, and had done great things.\'\r\n\r\n\'He was the grandest gentleman I ever saw, and had such, a manner,\'\r\nsaid the mother, passing over the latter suggestion.  \'Anyway, I never\r\nthought what it all meant--all alone with the children as I was--till I\r\nfound people looking at me, and laughing at me, and then I heard Lady\r\nde Lyonnais and Mr. Egremont were coming down, very angry, to send me\r\naway.  I ought, I know it now, to have waited, for they would have\r\nwritten to my aunt.  But I was horribly frightened, and I couldn\'t bear\r\nto think of never seeing him again, and he came and comforted me, and\r\nsaid he would take me to Mrs. Houghton, the kind lady who was staying\r\nin the Ninon, and they would make it all square for me--and then--oh!\r\nit was very sweet--but I never knew that we were sailing away to Jersey\r\nto be married!  I knew it was very dreadful without any one\'s leave,\r\nbut it was so noble of him to take the poor little governess and defend\r\nher, and it wasn\'t as if my mother had been alive.  I didn\'t know Aunt\r\nUrsel then as I did afterwards.  And Mrs. Houghton said there was\r\nnothing else to be done.\'\r\n\r\n\'O don\'t leave off, mother.  Do tell me.  How long did you have him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Six weeks then--and afterwards one fortnight at Dieppe.  He was not\r\nfree.  He had an old uncle, General Egremont, who was sick and\r\nhot-tempered, and he was obliged to keep everything secret from him,\r\nand therefore from everybody else.  And so I was to live at Dieppe,\r\nwhile he went out to take care of his uncle, and you know--you know--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know, dear mother.  But I am sure he was saving somebody else,\r\nand it was a noble death!  And I know how Aunt Ursel came to Dieppe,\r\nand how I--your own little Frenchwoman--came to take care of you.  And\r\nhaven\'t we been jolly without any of these fine relations that never\r\nlooked after you all this time?  Besides, you know he is very likely to\r\nbe on a lonely coral island, and will come home yet. I often think he\r\nis.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear child, I have been happier than I deserved,\' said Alice\r\nEgremont, drying her eyes.  \'But oh! Nuttie, I hope you will be a wiser\r\nwoman than your mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, don\'t go on in that way!  Why, I\'ve such advantages!  I\'ve Miss\r\nMary, and Aunt Ursel, and Mr. Spyers, and Mr. Dutton, and you, you poor\r\nlittle thing, had nobody!  One good thing is, we shall get the\r\nwater-soldier.  Mr. Dutton needn\'t come, for he\'s like a cat, and won\'t\r\nsoil his boots, but Gerard is dying to get another look at the old\r\nruin.  He can\'t make up his mind about the cross on one of the\r\nstone-coffin lids, so he\'ll be delighted to come, and he\'ll get it out\r\nof the pond for us.  I wonder when we can go.  To-night is choir\r\npractice, and to-morrow is cutting-out day.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth was not sorry that the small sociabilities of the\r\nfriends did not leave her alone with her niece all that evening, or the\r\nnext day, when there was a grand cutting-out for the working party,--an\r\noperation always performed in the holidays.  Miss Headworth had of late\r\nyears been excused from it, and it gave her the opportunity she wanted\r\nof a consultation with Mr. Dutton.  He was her prime adviser in\r\neverything, from her investments (such as they were) to the\r\neccentricities of her timepieces; and as the cuckoo-clock had that\r\nnight cuckooed all the hours round in succession, no one thought it\r\nwonderful that she should send a twisted note entreating him to call as\r\nearly as he could in the afternoon.  Of course Nuttie\'s chatter had\r\nproclaimed the extraordinary visitors, and it needed not the old lady\'s\r\ndash under "on an anxious affair" to bring him to her little\r\ndrawing-room as soon as he could quit his desk.  Perhaps he hastened\r\nhis work with a hope in his heart which he durst not express, but the\r\nagitation on the usually placid face forbade him to entertain it for an\r\ninstant, and he only said, \'So our expedition has led to unforeseen\r\nconsequences, Miss Headworth.\'  And then she answered under her breath,\r\nas if afraid of being overheard: \'Mr. Dutton, my poor child does not\r\nknow it yet, but the man is alive!\'\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton compressed his lips.  It was the greater shock, for he had\r\nactually made inquiries at the Yacht Club, but the officials there\r\neither had not been made aware of the reappearance of the two\r\nEgremonts, or they did not think it worth while to look beyond the\r\nrecord which declared that all hands had perished, and the connection\r\nof the uncle and nephew with the Yacht Club had not been renewed.\r\nPresently he said, \'Then hers was a right instinct.  There is reason to\r\nbe thankful.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth was too full of her own anxieties to heed his causes for\r\nthankfulness.  She told what she had heard from Lady Kirkaldy and from\r\nMark Egremont, and asked counsel whether it could be Alice\'s duty to\r\nreturn to the man who had deserted her, or even to accept anything from\r\nhim.  There was an impetuous and indignant spirit at the bottom of the\r\nold lady\'s heart, in spite of the subdued life she had led for so many\r\nyears, and she hardly brooked the measured considerate manner in which\r\nher adviser declared that all depended on circumstances, and the manner\r\nin which Captain Egremont made the first move.  At present no one was\r\nacting but young Mark, and, as Mr. Dutton observed, it was not a matter\r\nin which a man was very likely to submit to a nephew\'s dictation.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly no need for Mrs. Egremont to _force_ her presence\r\non him.  But Mr. Dutton did think that for her own sake and her child\'s\r\nthere ought to be full recognition of their rights, and that this\r\nshould be proved by their maintenance.\r\n\r\n\'I imagine that Ursula may probably be a considerable heiress, and her\r\nlights must not be sacrificed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor little girl!  Will it be for her happiness?  I doubt it greatly!\'\r\n\r\n\'Of that I suppose we have no right to judge,\' said Mr. Dutton,\r\nsomewhat tremulously. \'Justice is what we have to look to, and to allow\r\nNuttie to be passed over would be permitting a slur to be cast on her\r\nand her mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see that,\' said Miss Headworth, with an effort.  \'I suppose I am\r\nafter all a selfish, faithless old woman, and it is not in my hands\r\nafter all.  But I must prepare my poor Alice for what may be coming.\'\r\n\r\n\'If any terms are offered to her, she had better put the matter into a\r\nlawyer\'s hands.  Dobson would be a safe man to deal with.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth was amazed that he--who had helped her in many a little\r\nquestion bordering on law--should not proffer his aid now in this\r\ngreatest stress.  He was a resolute, self-controlled man, and she never\r\nguessed at the feeling that made him judge himself to be no fitting\r\nchampion for Alice Egremont against her husband.  Ever since, ten years\r\nago, he had learnt that his beautiful neighbour did not regard herself\r\nso certainly a widow as to venture to open her heart to any other love,\r\nhe had lived patiently on, content to serve her as a trustworthy\r\nfriend, and never betraying the secret hope so long cherished and now\r\nentirely crushed.\r\n\r\nHe was relieved to escape from the interview, and the poor old lady\r\nremained a little more certain as to her duty perhaps, but with a\r\ncertainty that only made her more unhappy, and she was so restless and\r\nnervous that, in the middle of the evening\'s reading of Archbishop\r\nTrench\'s Lectures on History, Alice suddenly broke off in the very\r\nmiddle of a sentence and exclaimed, \'Aunt Ursel! you are keeping\r\nsomething from me.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth made a faint attempt by saying something about\r\npresently, and glancing with her eyes to indicate that it was to be\r\nreserved till after Nuttie\'s bedtime, but the young lady comprehended\r\nthe signs and exclaimed, \'Never mind me, Aunt Ursel,--I know all about\r\nmother; she told me last night.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is!\' broke in Mrs. Egremont, who had been watching her aunt\'s face.\r\n\'You have heard of _him_.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, my father!  You really have!\' cried Nuttie.  \'Then he really was\r\non the desert island all this time; I was quite sure of it.  How\r\ndelightful!\'  She jumped up and looked at the door, as if she expected\r\nto see him appear that instant, clad in skins like Robinson Crusoe, but\r\nher aunt\'s nervous agitation found vent in a sharp reproof: \'Nuttie,\r\nhold your tongue, and don\'t be such a foolish child, or I shall send\r\nyou out of the room this instant!\'\r\n\r\n\'But aunt?\' gasped Alice, unable to bear the suspense.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, my poor dear child.  Captain Egremont with the General got off\r\nwith some of the crew in a boat when the Ninon was burnt.  He spent a\r\ngood many years abroad with the old man, but he has now inherited the\r\nfamily place, and is living there.\'  Miss Headworth felt as if she had\r\nfired a cannon and looked to see the effect.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, if we could have stayed at Dieppe!\' said Mrs. Egremont.  \'But we\r\ndid write back to say where we could be heard of.\'\r\n\r\n\'That was of no use.  Mark found no traces of us when he went thither.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did he send Mark?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  My dear Alice, I must not conceal from you that this is all Mr.\r\nMark Egremont\'s doing.  He seems to have been helping his uncle with\r\nhis papers when he came on the evidence of your marriage, and,\r\nremembering you as he does, he forced the confession of it from the\r\ncaptain, and of his own accord set forth to discover what had become of\r\nyou and to see justice done to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear little Mark!\' said she; \'he always was such an affectionate\r\nlittle boy.\'\r\n\r\n\'And now, my dear, you must consider how you will receive any advances\r\non his part.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Aunt Ursel, don\'t!  I can\'t talk now.  Please let me go to bed.\r\nNuttie, dear, you need not come yet.\'\r\n\r\nThe desire for solitude, in which to realise what she had heard, was\r\noverpowering, and she fled away in the summer twilight, leaving Nuttie\r\nwith wide open eyes, looking after her vanished hero and desert island.\r\n\r\n\'My poor Alice!\' sighed the old lady.\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Ursel!\' exclaimed Nuttie, \'was--I mean--is my father a good or a\r\nbad man?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, should a daughter ask such a question?\'\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Ursel, I can\'t help it.  I think I ought to know all about it,\'\r\nsaid Nuttie gravely, putting away her childishness and sitting down by\r\nher aunt.  \'I did not think so much of it when mother told me they\r\neloped, because, though I know it was very wrong, people do do odd\r\nthings sometimes when they are very much in love (she said it in a\r\nsuperior patronising tone that would have amused Miss Headworth very\r\nmuch at any other time); and it has not spoilt mother for being the\r\ndearest, sweetest, best thing in the world, and, besides, they had\r\nneither of them any fathers or mothers to disobey.  But, then, when I\r\nfound he was so old, and that he kept it a secret, and must have told\r\nstories only for the sake of money (uttered with extreme contempt), I\r\ndidn\'t like it.  And if he left her as Theseus left Ariadne, or Sir\r\nLancelot left Elaine, I--I don\'t think it is nice.  Do you think he\r\nonly pretended to be lost in the Ninon to get rid of her, or that he\r\ncould not find her?\'\r\n\r\n\'The Ninon was really reported lost with all on board,\' said Miss\r\nHeadworth.  \'That was ascertained.  He was saved by a Chilian ship, and\r\nseems to have been a good while making his way back to Europe.  I had\r\ntaken care that our address should be known at Dieppe, but it is quite\r\npossible that he may not have applied to the right people, or that they\r\nmay not have preserved my letter, so that we cannot feel sore that he\r\nwas to blame.\'\r\n\r\n\'If he had been worth anything at all, he would have moved heaven and\r\nearth to find her!\' cried Nuttie; \'and you said yourself it was all\r\n_that_ Mark\'s doing!\'\r\n\r\n\'He seems to be a very upright and generous young man, that Mr. Mark\r\nEgremont,\' said Miss Headworth, a whole romance as to Nuttie\'s future\r\ndestiny sweeping across her mind in an instant, with a mental\r\ndispensation to first cousins in such a case.  \'I think you will find\r\nhim a staunch champion even against his own interests.\'\r\n\r\nPerceptions came across Nuttie.  \'Oh, then I am a sort of lost heiress,\r\nlike people in a story!  I see!  But, Aunt Ursel, what do you think\r\nwill happen?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear child, I cannot guess in the least.  Perhaps the Egremont\r\nproperty will not concern you, and only go to male heirs.  That would\r\nbe the best thing, since in any case you must be sufficiently provided\r\nfor.  Your father must do that.\'\r\n\r\n\'But about mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'A proper provision must be insisted on for her,\' said Miss Headworth.\r\n\'It is no use, however, to speculate on the future.  We cannot guess\r\nhow Mr. Mark Egremont\'s communication will be received, or whether any\r\nwish will be expressed for your mother\'s rejoining your father.  In\r\nsuch a case the terms must be distinctly understood, and I have full\r\ntrust both in Mr. Mark and in Lady Kirkaldy as her champions to see\r\nthat justice is done to you both.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure he doesn\'t deserve that mother should go to him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nor do I expect that he will wish it, or that it would be proper; but\r\nhe is bound to give her a handsome maintenance, and I think most\r\nprobably you will be asked to stay with your uncle and cousins,\' said\r\nMiss Headworth, figuring to herself a kind of Newstead Abbey or some\r\nsuch scene of constant orgies at Bridgefield Egremont.\r\n\r\n\'I shall accept nothing from the family that does not include mother,\'\r\nsaid Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Dear child, I foresee many trials, but you must be her protector.\'\r\n\r\n\'That I will,\' said Nuttie; and in the gallant purpose she went to bed,\r\nto find her mother either asleep or feigning slumber with tears on her\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE WATER-SOLDIER.\r\n\r\n  \'Presumptuous maid, with looks intent,\r\n  Again she stretched, again she bent,\r\n  Nor knew the gulf between.\'--GRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt all seemed like a dream to Ursula, perhaps likewise to her mother,\r\nwhen they rose to the routine of daily life with the ordinary interests\r\nof the day before them.  There was a latent unwillingness in Mrs.\r\nEgremont\'s mind to discuss the subject with either aunt or daughter;\r\nand when the post brought no letter, Ursula, after a moment\'s sense of\r\nflatness, was relieved, and returned to her eager desire to hurry after\r\nthe water-soldier.  It was feasible that very afternoon.  Mary Nugent\r\ncame in with the intelligence.\r\n\r\n\'And can Gerard come? or we shall only look at it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Gerard can come, and so will Mr. Dutton,\' said Mary, who,\r\nstanding about half-way between Mrs. Egremont and her daughter, did not\r\nthink herself quite a sufficient chaperon.\r\n\r\n\'He will look on like a hen at her ducklings,\' said Nuttie.  \'It is\r\ncruel to take him, poor man!\'\r\n\r\n\'Meantime, Nuttie, do you like an hour of "Marie Stuart?"\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, thank you!\'  But she whispered, \'Aunt Ursel, may I tell her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ask your mother, my dear.\'\r\n\r\nLeave was given, half reluctantly, and with a prohibition against\r\nmentioning the subject to any one else, but both mother and aunt had\r\nconfidence in Mary Nugent\'s wisdom and discretion, so the two friends\r\nsat on the wall together, and Ursula poured out her heart.  Poor little\r\ngirl! she was greatly discomfited at the vanishing of her noble vision\r\nof the heroic self-devoted father, and ready on the other hand to\r\nbelieve him a villain, like Bertram Risingham, or \'the Pirate,\' being\r\npossessed by this idea on account of his West Indian voyages.  At any\r\nrate, she was determined not to be accepted or acknowledged without her\r\nmother, and was already rehearsing magnanimous letters of refusal.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary listened and wondered, feeling sometimes as if this were as\r\nmuch a romance as the little yacht going down with the burning ship;\r\nand then came back the recollection that there was a real fact that\r\nNuttie had a father, and that it was entirely uncertain what part he\r\nmight take, or what the girl might be called on to do.  Considering\r\nanxiously these bearings of the question, she scarcely heard what she\r\nwas required to assent to, in one of Nuttie\'s eager, \'Don\'t you think\r\nso?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear Nuttie,\' she said, rousing herself, \'what I do think is that\r\nit will all probably turn out exactly contrariwise to our imaginations,\r\nso I believe it would be wisest to build up as few fancies as possible,\r\nbut only to pray that you may have a right judgment in all things, and\r\nhave strength to do what is right, whatever you may see that to be.\'\r\n\r\n\'And of course that will be to stick by mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'There can be little doubt of that, but the how?  No, dear, do not let\r\nus devise all sorts of _hows_ when we have nothing to go upon. That\r\nwould be of no use, and only perplex you when the time comes. It would\r\nbe much better to "do the nexte thinge," and read our "Marie Stuart."\'\r\n\r\nNuttie pouted a little, but submitted, though she now and then broke\r\ninto a translation with \'You know mother will never stand up for\r\nherself,\' or \'They think I shall be asked to stay with the Egremonts,\r\nbut I must work up for the exam.\'\r\n\r\nHowever, the school habit of concentrating her attention prevailed, and\r\nthe study quieted Nuttie\'s excitement.  The expedition took place as\r\narranged.  There was a train which stopped so that the party could go\r\ndown by it, and the distance was not too great for walking back.\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton met them on the platform, well armed with his neat silk\r\numbrella, and his black poodle, Monsieur, trotting solemnly after him.\r\nGerard Godfrey bore materials for an exact transcript of the Abbot\'s\r\nmonumental cross, his head being full of church architecture, while\r\nNuttie carried a long green tin case, or vasculum as she chose to call\r\nit, with her three vowels, U A E, and the stars of the Little Bear\r\nconspicuously painted on it in white.\r\n\r\n\'You did not venture on that the other day,\' said Mr. Dutton.  \'How\r\nmuch of the park do you mean to carry away in it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me take it,\' said Gerard politely.\r\n\r\n\'No, thank you.  You\'d leave it behind, while you were pottering over\r\nthe mouldings.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are much more likely to leave it behind yourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'What--with my soldier, my Stratiotes, in it?  I think I see myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Give it to me,\' said Gerard.  \'Of course I can\'t see you carrying a\r\ngreat thing like that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t you, indeed?\'\r\n\r\n\'Gently, gently, my dear,\' said Miss Mary, as the young people seemed\r\nvery near a skirmish, and the train was sweeping up.  Then there was\r\nanother small scuffle, for Nuttie had set her heart on the third class;\r\nbut Mr. Dutton had taken second-class tickets, and was about to hand\r\nthem into a carriage whence there had just emerged a very supercilious\r\nblack-moustached valet, who was pulling out a leather-covered\r\ndressing-case, while Gerard was consoling Nuttie by telling her that\r\nMonsieur never deigned to go third class.\r\n\r\n\'It is a smoking carriage,\' said Miss Nugent, on the step.  \'Pah! how\r\nit smells,\' as she jumped back.\r\n\r\n\'Beautiful backy--a perfect nosegay,\' said Gerard.\r\n\r\n\'Trust that fellow for having the best.\'\r\n\r\n\'His master\'s, no doubt,\' suggested Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'You\'d better go in it, to enjoy his reversion,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'And where\'s my escort, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m sure we don\'t want you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nuttie, my dear,\' expostulated Miss Nugent, dragging her into the next\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\'You may enjoy the fragrance still,\' said Nuttie when seated.  \'Do you\r\nsee--there\'s the man\'s master; he has stood him up against that post,\r\nwith his cigar, to wait while he gets out the luggage.  I daresay you\r\ncan get a whiff if you lean out far enough.\'\r\n\r\n\'I say! that figure is a study!\' said Gerard.  \'What is it that he is\r\nso like?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! I know,\' said Nuttie.  \'It is Lord Frederick Verisopht, and the\r\nbad gentlefolks in the pictures to the old numbers of Dickens that you\r\nhave got, Miss Mary.  Now, isn\'t he?  Look! only Lord Frederick wasn\'t\r\nfat.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie was in a state of excitement that made her peculiarly\r\nunmanageable, and Miss Nugent was very grateful to Mr. Dutton for his\r\nsharp though general admonition against staring, while, under pretext\r\nof disposing of the umbrella and the vasculum, he stood up, so as to\r\nblock the window till they were starting.\r\n\r\nThere was no one else to observe them but a demure old lady, and in ten\r\nminutes\' time they were in open space, where high spirits might work\r\nthemselves off, though the battle over the botanical case was ended by\r\nMiss Nugent, who strongly held that ladies should carry their own extra\r\nencumbrances, and slung it with a scarf over Nuttie\'s shoulders in a\r\nknowing knapsack fashion.\r\n\r\nThe two young people had known one another all their lives, for Gerard\r\nwas the son of a medical man who had lived next door to Miss Headworth\r\nwhen the children were young.  The father was dead, and the family had\r\nleft the place, but this son had remained at school, and afterwards had\r\nbeen put into the office at the umbrella factory under charge of Mr.\r\nDutton, whose godson he was, and who treated him as a nephew.  He was a\r\ngood-hearted, steady young fellow, with his whole interest in\r\necclesiastical details, wearing a tie in accordance with \'the colours,\'\r\nand absorbed in church music and decorations, while his recreations\r\nwere almost all in accordance therewith.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of merriment, as he drew and measured at the very\r\nscanty ruins, which were little more than a few fragments of wall,\r\novergrown luxuriantly with ivy and clematis, but enclosing some fine\r\nold coffin-lids with floriated crosses, interesting to those who cared\r\nfor architecture and church history, as Mr. Dutton tried to make the\r\nchildren do, so that their ecclesiastical feelings might be less\r\nnarrow, and stand on a surer foundation than present interest, a\r\nslightly aggressive feeling of contempt for all the other town\r\nchurches, and a pleasing sense of being persecuted.\r\n\r\nThey fought over the floriations and mouldings with great zest, and\r\neach maintained a date with youthful vigour--both being, as Mr. Dutton\r\nby and by showed them, long before the foundation.  The pond had been\r\nleft to the last with a view to the wellbeing of the water-soldier on\r\nthe return.  Here the difficulties of the capture were great, for the\r\nnearest plant flourished too far from the bank to be reached with\r\ncomfort, and besides, the sharp-pointed leaves to which it owes its\r\nname were not to be approached with casual grasps.\r\n\r\n\'Oh Monsieur, I wish you were a Beau,\' sighed Nuttie.  \'Why, are you\r\ntoo stupid to go and get it?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is a proof of his superior intelligence,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'But really it is too ridiculous--too provoking--to have come all this\r\nway and not get it,\' cried the tantalised Nuttie.  \'Oh, Gerard, are you\r\ntaking off your boots and stockings?  You duck!\'\r\n\r\n\'Just what I wish I was,\' said the youth, rolling up his trousers.\r\n\r\nBut even the paddling in did not answer.  Mr. Dutton called out\r\nanxiously, \'Take care, Gerard, the bottom may be soft,\' and came down\r\nto the very verge just in time to hold out his hand, and prevent an\r\nutterly disastrous fall, for Gerard, in spite of his bare feet, sank at\r\nonce into mud, and on the first attempt to take a step forward, found\r\nhis foot slipping away from under him, and would in another instant\r\nhave tumbled backwards into the slush and weeds.  He scrambled back,\r\nhis hat falling off into the reeds, and splashing Mr. Dutton all over,\r\nwhile Monsieur began to bark \'with astonishment at seeing his master in\r\nsuch a plight,\' declared the ladies, who stood convulsed with cruel\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\'Isn\'t it dreadful?\' exclaimed Ursula.\r\n\r\n\'Well!  It might have been worse,\' gravely said Mr. Dutton, wiping off\r\nthe more obnoxious of his splashes with his pocket handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\'Oh I didn\'t mean you, but the water-soldier,\' said Nuttie.  \'To have\r\ncome five miles for it in vain!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what to suggest,\' added Gerard.  \'Even if the ladies were\r\nto retire--\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' interposed Mr. Dutton, \'\'tis no swimming ground, and I forbid\r\nthe expedient.  You would only be entangled in the weeds.\'\r\n\r\n\'Behold!\' exclaimed Mary, who had been prowling about the banks, and\r\nnow held up in triumph one of the poles with a bill-hook at the end\r\nused for cutting weed.\r\n\r\n\'Bravo, Miss Nugent!\' cried Gerard.\r\n\r\n\'Female wit has circumvented the water-soldier,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t cry out too soon,\' returned Mary; \'the soldier may float off and\r\nescape you yet.\'\r\n\r\nHowever, the capture was safely accomplished, without even a dip under\r\nwater to destroy the beauty of the white flowers.  With these, and a\r\nfew waterlilies secured by Gerard for the morrow\'s altar vases, the\r\nparty set out on their homeward walk, through plantations of whispering\r\nfirs, the low sun tingeing the trunks with ruddy light; across heathery\r\ncommons, where crimson heath abounded, and the delicate blush-coloured\r\nwax-belled species was a prize; by cornfields in ear hanging out their\r\ndainty stamens; along hedges full of exquisite plumes of feathering or\r\nnodding grass, of which Nuttie made bouquets and botanical studies, and\r\nGerard stored for harvest decorations.  They ran and danced on together\r\nwith Monsieur at their heels, while the elders watched them with some\r\nsadness and anxiety. Free-masonry had soon made both Mary and Mr.\r\nDutton aware of each other\'s initiation, and they had discussed the\r\nmatter in all its bearings, agreed that the man was a scoundrel, and\r\nthe woman an angel, even if she had once been weak, and that she ought\r\nto be very resolute with him if he came to terms.  And then they looked\r\nafter their young companions, and Mr. Dutton said, \'Poor children, what\r\nis before them?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is well they are both so young,\' answered Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHAT MAN.\r\n\r\n  \'It is the last time--\'tis the last!\'--SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSundays were the ever-recurring centres of work and interests to the\r\nlittle circle in St. Ambrose\'s Road.  To them the church services and\r\nthe various classes and schools were the great objects and excitements\r\nof the week.  A certain measure of hopeful effort and varying success\r\nis what gives zest to life, and the purer and higher the aim, and the\r\nmore unmixed the motives, the greater the happiness achieved by the\r\n\'something attempted, something done.\'\r\n\r\nSetting apart actual spiritual devotion, the altar vases, purchased by\r\na contribution of careful savings, and adorned with the Monks Horton\r\nlilies, backed by ferns from the same quarter; the surplices made by\r\nthe ladies themselves, the chants they had practised, the hymns they\r\nhad taught, could not but be much more interesting to them than if they\r\nhad been mere lookers on.  Every cross on the markers, every flower on\r\nthe altar cloth was the work of one or other of them; everything in the\r\nchurch was an achievement, and choir boys, school children, Bible\r\nclasses, every member of the regular congregation, had some special\r\ninterest; nay, every irregular member or visitor might be a convert in\r\ntime--if not a present sympathiser, and at the very least might swell\r\nthe offertory that was destined to so many needs of the struggling\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThus it was with some curiosity mingled with self-reproach that Nuttie,\r\nwhile singing her Benedictus among the tuneful shop-girls, to whom she\r\nwas bound to set an example, became aware of yesterday\'s first-class\r\ntraveller lounging, as far as the rows of chairs would permit, in the\r\naisle, and, as she thought, staring hard at her mother.  It was well\r\nthat Mrs. Egremont\'s invariable custom was never to lift her eyes from\r\nher book or her harmonium, or she surely must have been disconcerted,\r\nher daughter thought, by the eyes that must have found her out, under\r\nher little black net bonnet and veil, as the most beautiful woman in\r\nchurch,--as she certainly was,--even that fine good-for-nothing\r\ngentleman thinking so.  Nuttie would add his glances to the glories of\r\nher lovely mother!\r\n\r\nAnd she did so, with triumph in her tone of reprobation, as she trotted\r\noff, after the early dinner, to her share of Sunday-school work as\r\nusual under Miss Nugent\'s wing.  It began with a children\'s service,\r\nand then ensued, in rooms at the factory, lent by Mr. Dutton, the\r\nteaching that was to supply the omissions of the Board School; the\r\nestablishment of a voluntary one being the next ambition of St.\r\nAmbrose\'s.\r\n\r\nComing home from their labours, in the fervent discussion of their\r\nscholars, and exchanging remarks and greetings with the other teachers\r\nof various calibres, the friends reached their own road, and there, to\r\ntheir amazement, beheld Miss Headworth.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it really is!\' cried Nuttie.  \'We can\'t be too late?  No--there\'s\r\nno bell!  Aunt Ursel!  What has brought you out?  What\'s the matter?\r\nWhere\'s mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'In the house.  My dear,\' catching hold of her, and speaking\r\nbreathlessly, \'I came out to prepare you.  He is come--your father--\'\r\n\r\n\'Where?\' cried Nuttie, rather wildly.\r\n\r\n\'He is in the drawing-room with your mother.  I said I would send you.\'\r\nPoor Miss Headworth gasped with agitation.  \'Oh! where\'s Mr.\r\nDutton--not that anything can be done--\'\r\n\r\n\'Is it _that man_?\' asked Nuttie, and getting no answer, \'I know it is!\r\nOh Aunt Ursel, how could you leave her with him?  I must go and protect\r\nher.  Gerard--come.  No, go and fetch Mr. Dutton.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush! hush, Nuttie,\' cried her aunt, grasping her.  \'You know nothing\r\nabout it.  Wait here till I can tell you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come in here, dear Miss Headworth,\' said Mary, gently drawing her arm\r\ninto hers, for the poor old lady could hardly stand for trembling, and\r\nbidding Gerard open the door of her own house with the latch-key.\r\n\r\nShe took them into the dining-room, so as not to disturb her mother,\r\nsent Gerard off after Mr. Dutton in the very uttermost astonishment and\r\nbewilderment, and set Miss Headworth down in an easy-chair, where she\r\nrecovered herself, under Mary\'s soothing care, enough to tell her story\r\nin spite of Nuttie\'s exclamations.  \'Wait! wait, Nuttie!  You mustn\'t\r\nburst in on them so!  No, you need not be afraid.  Don\'t be a silly\r\nchild!  He won\'t hurt her!  Oh no!  They are quite delighted to meet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Delighted to meet?\' said Nuttie, as if transfixed.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said her aunt.  \'Oh yes, I always knew the poor child cared for\r\nhim and tried to believe in him all along.  He only had to say the\r\nword.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t,\' cried the girl, her eyes flashing.  \'Why didn\'t you ask\r\nhim how he could desert her and leave her?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear! how can one come between husband and wife?  Oh, my poor\r\nAlice!\'\r\n\r\n\'How was it, how did they meet, dear Miss Headworth?\' asked Mary,\r\nadministering the wine she had been pouring out.\r\n\r\n\'You hadn\'t been gone half an hour, Alice was reading to me, and I was\r\njust dozing, when in came Louisa.  "A gentleman to see Mrs. Egremont,"\r\nshe said, and there he was just behind.  We rose up--she did not know\r\nhim at once, but he just said "Edda, my little Edda, sweeter than ever,\r\nI knew you at once," or something of that sort, and she gave one little\r\ncry of "I knew you would come," and sprang right into his arms.\r\nI--well, I meant to make him understand how he had treated her, but\r\njust as I began "Sir"--he came at me with his hand outstretched--\'\r\n\r\n\'You didn\'t take it, aunt, I hope?\' cried Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'My dear, when you see him, you will know how impossible it is.  He\r\n_has_ that high-bred manner it is as if he were conferring a favour.\r\n"Miss Headworth, I conclude," said he, "a lady to whom I owe more than\r\nI can express."  Just as if I had done it for his sake.\'  Miss Nugent\r\nfelt this open expression dangerous on account of the daughter, and she\r\nlooked her consternation at Mr. Dutton, who had quietly entered,\r\nruthlessly shutting Gerard Godfrey out with only such a word of\r\nexplanation as could be given on the way.\r\n\r\n\'Then he comes with--with favourable intentions,\' said Mary, putting as\r\nmuch admonition as she could into her voice.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! no doubt of that,\' said Miss Headworth, drawing herself together.\r\n\'He spoke of the long separation,--said he had never been able to find\r\nher, till the strange chance of his nephew stumbling on her at Abbots\r\nNorton.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is--possib--probably true,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'It can\'t be,\' broke in Nuttie.  \'He never troubled himself about it\r\ntill his nephew found the papers.  You said so, Aunt Ursel!  He is a\r\ndreadful traitor of a man, just like Marmion, or Theseus, or Lancelot,\r\nand now he is telling lies about it!  Don\'t look at me. Aunt Ursel,\r\nthey are lies, and I _will_ say it, and he took in poor dear mother\r\nonce, and now he is taking her in again, and I can\'t bear that he\r\nshould be my father!\'\r\n\r\nIt was so entirely true, yet so shocking to hear from her mouth, that\r\nall three stood aghast, as she stood with heaving chest, crimson\r\ncheeks, and big tears in her eyes.  Miss Headworth only muttered, \'Oh,\r\nmy poor child, you mustn\'t!\'\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton prevented another passionate outburst by his tone of grave,\r\ngentle authority.  \'Listen a moment, Ursula,\' he said.  \'It is\r\nunhappily true that this man has acted in an unjustifiable way towards\r\nyour mother and yourself.  But there are, no doubt, many more excuses\r\nfor him than you know of, and as I found a few years ago that the\r\npeople at Dieppe had lost the address that had been left with them, he\r\nmust have found no traces of your mother there.  You cannot understand\r\nthe difficulties that may have been in his way.  And there is no use,\r\nquite the contrary, in making the worst of him.  He has found your\r\nmother out, and it seems that he claims her affectionately, and she\r\nforgives and welcomes him--out of the sweet tenderness of her heart.\'\r\n\r\n\'She may--but I can\'t,\' murmured Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'That is not a fit thing for a daughter, nor a Christian, to say,\' Mr.\r\nDutton sternly said.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis not for myself--\'tis for her,--\'objected Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s nonsense; a mere excuse,\' he returned.  \'You have nothing at\r\nall to forgive, since he did not know you were in existence.  And as to\r\nyour mother, whom you say you put first, what greater grief or pain can\r\nyou give her than by showing enmity and resentment against her husband,\r\nwhen she, the really injured person, loves and forgives?\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'s a bad man.  If she goes back to him, I know he will make her\r\nunhappy--\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t know any such thing, but you do know that your opposition\r\nwill make her unhappy.  Remember, there\'s no choice in the matter. He\r\nhas legal rights over you both, and since he shows himself ready (as I\r\nunderstand from Miss Headworth that he is) to give her and you your\r\nproper position, you have nothing to do but to be thankful.  I think\r\nmyself that it is a great subject of thankfulness that your mother can\r\nreturn so freely without any bitterness.  It is the blessing of such as\r\nshe--\'\r\n\r\nNuttie stood pouting, but more thoughtful and less violent, as she\r\nsaid, \'How can I be thankful?  I don\'t want position or anything.  I\r\nonly want him to let my--my own mother, and aunt, and me alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Child, you are talking of what you do not understand.  You must not\r\nwaste any more time in argument.  Your mother has sent for you, and it\r\nis your duty to go and let her introduce you to your father.  I have\r\nlittle doubt that you will find him very unlike all your imagination\r\nrepresents him, but let that be as it may, the fifth Commandment does\r\nnot say, "Honour only thy good father," but, "Honour thy father."  Come\r\nnow, put on your gloves--get her hat right, if you please, Miss Mary.\r\nThere--now, come along, be a reasonable creature, and a good girl, and\r\ndo not give unnecessary pain and vexation to your mother.\'  He gave her\r\nhis arm, and led her away.\r\n\r\n\'Well done, Mr. Dutton!\' exclaimed Miss Nugent.\r\n\r\n\'Poor Mr. Dutton!\'  All Aunt Ursel\'s discretion could not suppress that\r\nsigh, but Mary prudently let it pass unnoticed, only honouring in her\r\nheart the unselfishness and self-restraint of the man whose long,\r\npatient, unspoken hopes had just received a death-blow.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Mary!  I never thought it would have been like this!\' cried the\r\npoor old lady.  \'I ought not to have spoken as I did before the child,\r\nbut I was so taken by surprise!  Alice turned to him just as if he had\r\nbeen the most faithful, loving husband in the world.  She is believing\r\nevery word he says.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is very happy for her that she can,\' pleaded Mary.\r\n\r\n\'So it is, yes, but--when one knows what he is, and what she is!  Oh,\r\nMr. Dutton, is the poor child gone in?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I saw her safe into the room.  She was very near running off up\r\nthe stairs,\' said Mr. Dutton.  \'But I daresay she is fascinated by this\r\ntime.  That sort of man has great power over women.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nuttie is hardly a woman yet,\' said Miss Nugent.\r\n\r\n\'No, but there must be a strong reaction, when she sees something\r\nunlike her compound of Marmion and Theseus.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose there is no question but that they must go with him!\' said\r\nMiss Headworth wistfully.\r\n\r\n\'Assuredly.  You say he--this Egremont--was affectionate,\' said Mr.\r\nDutton quietly, but Mary saw his fingers white with his tight clenching\r\nof the bar of the chair.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, warmly affectionate, delighted to find her prettier than ever,\r\npoor dear; I suppose he meant it.  Heaven forgive me, if I am judging\r\nhim too hardly, but I verily believe he went to church to reconnoitre,\r\nand see whether she pleased his fancy--\'\r\n\r\n\'And do you understand,\' added Mr. Dutton, \'that he is prepared to do\r\nher full justice, and introduce her to his family and friends as his\r\nwife, on equal terms?  Otherwise, even if she were unwilling to stand\r\nup for herself, it would be the duty of her friends to make some\r\nstipulations.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am pretty sure that he does,\' said the aunt; \'I did not stay long\r\nwhen I saw that I was not wanted, but I heard him say something about\r\nhis having a home for her now, and her cutting out the Redcastle\r\nladies.\'\r\n\r\n\'Besides, there is the nephew, Mr. Mark Egremont,\' said Mary.  \'He will\r\ntake care of her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Mr. Dutton.  \'It appears to be all right.  At any rate,\r\nthere can be no grounds for interference on our part.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton took his leave with these words, wringing Miss Headworth\'s\r\nhand in mute sympathy, and she, poor old lady, when he was gone, fairly\r\ncollapsed into bitter weeping over the uncertain future of those whom\r\nshe had loved as her own children, and who now must leave her desolate.\r\nMary did her best with comfort and sympathy, and presently took her to\r\nshare her griefs and fears with gentle old Mrs. Nugent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FATHER.\r\n\r\n  \'I do think this lady\r\n  To be my child.\'--King Lear.\r\n\r\n\r\nNuttie, in her fresh holland Sunday dress, worked in crewels with wild\r\nstrawberries by her mother\'s hands, and with a white-trimmed straw hat,\r\nwas almost shoved into the little drawing-room by Mr. Dutton, though he\r\nwas himself invisible.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were in such a daze of tears that she hardly saw more at first\r\nthan that some one was there with her mother on the sofa.  \'Ah, there\r\nshe is!\' she heard her mother cry, and both rose.  Her mother\'s arm was\r\nround her waist, her hand was put into another, Mrs. Egremont\'s voice,\r\ntremulous with exceeding delight, said, \'Our child, our Ursula, our\r\nNuttie!  Oh, this is what I have longed for all these years!  Oh,\r\nthanks, thanks!\' and her hands left her daughter to be clasped and\r\nuplifted for a moment in fervent thanksgiving, while Nuttie\'s hand was\r\nheld, and a strange hairy kiss, redolent of tobacco-smoking, was on her\r\nforehead--a masculine one, such as she had never known, except her\r\ncousin Mark\'s, since the old rector died, and she had grown too big for\r\nMr. Dutton\'s embraces.  It was more strange than delightful, and yet\r\nshe felt the polish of the tone that said, \'We make acquaintance\r\nsomewhat late, Ursula, but better late than never.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked up at this new father, and understood instantly what she had\r\nheard of his being a grand gentleman.  There was a high-bred look about\r\nhim, an entire ease and perfect manner that made everything he did or\r\nsaid seem like gracious condescension, and took away the power of\r\nquestioning it at the moment.  He was not above the middle size, and\r\nwas becoming unwieldy; but there was something imposing and even\r\ngraceful in his deportment, and his bald narrow forehead looked\r\naristocratic, set off between side tufts of white hair, white whiskers,\r\nand moustaches waxed into sharp points, Victor Emmanuel fashion, and a\r\nround white curly beard.  His eyes were dark, and looked dull, with\r\nyellow unwholesome corners, and his skin was not of a pleasant colour,\r\nbut still, with all Nuttie\'s intentions of regarding him with horror,\r\nshe was subdued, partly by the grand breeding and air of distinction,\r\nand partly by the current of sympathy from her mother\'s look of perfect\r\nhappiness and exultation. She could not help feeling it a favour,\r\nalmost an undeserved favour, that so great a personage should say, \'A\r\ncomplete Egremont, I see. She has altogether the family face.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am so glad you think so,\' returned her mother.\r\n\r\n\'On the whole it is well, but she might have done better to resemble\r\nyou, Edda,\' he said caressingly; \'but perhaps that would have been too\r\nmuch for the Earlsforth natives.  William\'s girls will have enough to\r\nendure without a double eclipse!\' and he laughed.\r\n\r\n\'I--I don\'t want--\' faltered the mother.\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t want, no, but you can\'t help it,\' he said, evidently with a\r\nproud delight in her beauty.  \'Now that I have seen the child,\' he\r\nadded, \'I will make my way back to the hotel.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you--won\'t you stay to tea or dinner?\' said his wife, beginning\r\nwith an imploring tone which hesitated as she reviewed possible chops\r\nand her aunt\'s dismay.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, I have ordered dinner at the hotel,\' he answered, \'and\r\nGregorio is waiting for me with a cab.  No doubt you will wish to make\r\narrangements with Madame--the old lady--and I will not trouble her\r\nfurther to-night.  I will send down Gregorio to-morrow morning, to tell\r\nyou what I arrange.  An afternoon train, probably, as we shall go no\r\nfarther than London.  You say Lady Kirkaldy called on you.  We might\r\nreturn her visit before starting, but I will let you know when I have\r\nlooked at the trains.  My compliments to Miss Headworth.  Good evening,\r\nsweetest.\'  He held his wife in a fond embrace, kissing her brow and\r\ncheeks and letting her cling to him, then added, \'Good evening, little\r\none,\' with a good-natured careless gesture with which Nuttie was quite\r\ncontent, for she had a certain loathing of the caresses that so charmed\r\nher mother.  And yet the command to make ready had been given with such\r\neasy authority that the idea of resisting it had never even entered her\r\nmind, though she stood still while her mother went out to the door with\r\nhim and watched him to the last.\r\n\r\nComing back, she threw her arms round her daughter, kissed her again\r\nand again, and, with showers of the glad tears long repressed, cried,\r\n\'Oh, my Nuttie, my child, what joy!  How shall I be thankful enough!\r\nYour father, your dear father!  Now it is all right.\'  Little sentences\r\nof ecstasy such as these, interspersed with caresses, all in the\r\nincoherence of overpowering delight, full of an absolute faith that the\r\nlost husband had loved her and been pining for her all these years, but\r\nthat he had been unable to trace her, and was as happy as she was in\r\nthe reunion.\r\n\r\nThe girl was somewhat bewildered, but she was carried along by this\r\nflood of exceeding joy and gladness.  The Marmion and Theseus images\r\nhad been dispelled by the reality, and, with Mr. Dutton\'s sharp reproof\r\nfresh upon her, she felt herself to have been doing a great injustice\r\nto her father; believed all that her mother did, and found herself the\r\nobject of a romantic recognition--if not the beggar girl become a\r\nprincess, at any rate, the little school-teacher a county lady!  And\r\nshe had never seen her mother so wildly, overpoweringly happy with joy.\r\nThat made her, too, feel that something grand and glorious had happened.\r\n\r\n\'What are we going to do?\' she asked, as the vehemence of Mrs.\r\nEgremont\'s emotion began to work itself off.\r\n\r\n\'Home!  He takes us to his home!  _His_ home!\' repeated her mother, in\r\na trance of joy, as the yearnings of her widowed heart now were\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but Aunt Ursel!\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor Aunt Ursel!  Oh, Nuttie, Nuttie, I had almost forgotten!  How\r\ncould I?\' and there was a shower of tears of compunction.  \'But he said\r\nhe owed everything to her!  She will come with us!  Or if she doesn\'t\r\nlive with us, we will make her live close by in a dear little cottage.\r\nWhere is she?  When did she go?  I never saw her go.\'\r\n\r\nThe sound of the front door was heard, for the visitor had been watched\r\naway and Miss Headworth was returning to her own house to be there\r\nreceived with another fervent gush of happiness, much more trying to\r\nher, poor thing, than to Nuttie.\r\n\r\nThere was evensong imminent, and the most needful act at the moment was\r\nto compose the harmonium-player sufficiently for her to take her part.\r\nMiss Headworth was really glad of the necessity, since it put off the\r\ndiscussion, and made a reason for silencing Nuttie until all should be\r\nmore recovered from the first agitation.  Alice Egremont herself was\r\nglad to carry her gratitude and thankfulness to the Throne of Grace,\r\nand in her voluntary, and all her psalms, there was an exulting strain\r\nthat no one had thought the instrument capable of producing, and that\r\nwent to the heart of more than one of her hearers.  No one who knew her\r\ncould doubt that hers was simply innocent exultation in the recovery of\r\nhim whom she so entirely loved and confided in.  But there could not\r\nbut be terrible doubts whether he were worthy of that trust, and what\r\nthe new page in her life would be.\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth had said they would not talk till after church, but\r\nthere was no deferring the matter then.  She was prepared, however,\r\nwhen her niece came up to her in a tender deprecating manner, saying,\r\n\'Aunt Ursel, dear Aunt Ursel, it does seem very ungrateful, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'He is going to take you away?  Yes, I saw that.  And it ought to be,\r\nmy dear.  You know where?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; to London first, to be fitted out, and then to his own home. To\r\nBridgefield Egremont.  I shall have to see Mr. Egremont,\' and her voice\r\nsank with shame.  \'But Mark will be good to me, and why should I care\r\nwhen I have him.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is quite right. I am glad it should be so,\' firmly said the old\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n\'And yet to leave you so suddenly.\'\r\n\r\n\'That can\'t be helped.\'\r\n\r\n\'And it will only be for a little while,\' she added, \'till you can make\r\narrangements to come to us.  My dear husband says he owes you\r\neverything.  So you must be with us, or close to us.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, it\'s very dear and good of you to think of it, but I must be\r\nindependent.\'  She put it in those words, unwilling again to speak\r\nunguardedly before Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, dear auntie, indeed you must!  Think what you are to us, and what\r\nyou have done for us.  We can\'t go away to be happy and prosperous and\r\nleave you behind.  Can we, Nuttie?  Come and help me to get her to\r\npromise.  Do--do dearest auntie,\' and she began the coaxing and\r\ncaressing natural to her, but Nuttie did not join in it, and Miss\r\nHeadworth shook her head and said gravely--\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t, Alice.  It is of no use.  I tell you once for all that my mind\r\nis made up.\'\r\n\r\nAlice, knowing by long experience that, when her aunt spoke in that\r\ntone, persuasion was useless, desisted, but looked at her in\r\nconsternation, with eyes swimming in tears.  Nuttie understood her a\r\nlittle better, and felt the prickings of distrust again.\r\n\r\n\'But, aunt, dear aunt, how can we leave you?  What will you do with all\r\nthe boarders,\' went on Mrs. Egremont.\r\n\r\n\'I shall see my way, my dear.  Do not think about that.  It is a great\r\nthing to see you and this child receive justice.\'\r\n\r\n\'And only think, after all the hard things that have been said of him,\r\nthat we should meet first at church!  He would not wait and send\r\nletters and messages by Mark.  You see he came down himself the first\r\nmoment.  I always knew he would.  Only I am so sorry for him, that he\r\nshould have lost all those sweet years when Nuttie was a tiny child.\r\nShe must do all she can to make up to him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh dear!\' broke out Nuttie.  \'It is so strange!  It will be all so\r\nstrange!\'\r\n\r\n\'It will be a very new life,\' said her aunt, rather didactically; \'but\r\nyou must do your best to be a good daughter, and to fill your new\r\nposition, and I have no doubt you will enjoy it.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I could but take all with me!\' said Nuttie.  \'Oh dear! whatever\r\nwill you do, Aunt Ursel?  Oh mother, the choir!  Who will play the\r\nharmonium? and who will lead the girls? and whatever will Mr. Spyers\r\ndo? and who will take my class?  Mother, couldn\'t we stay a little\r\nlonger to set things going here?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is nice of you to have thought of it, my dear,\' said Mrs. Egremont,\r\n\'but your father would not like to stay on here.\'\r\n\r\n\'But mightn\'t I stay, just a few days, mother, to wish everybody\r\ngood-bye?  Mr. Dutton, and Miss Mary, and Gerard, and all the girls?\'\r\n\r\nThere was some consolation in this plan, and the three women rested on\r\nit that night, Mrs. Egremont recovering composure enough to write three\r\nor four needful notes, explaining her sudden departure.  The aunt could\r\nnot talk of a future she so much dreaded for her nieces, losing in it\r\nthe thought of her own loneliness; Alice kept back her own loving,\r\ntender, undoubting joy with a curious sense that it was hard and\r\nungrateful towards the aunt; but it was impossible to think of that,\r\nand Nuttie was in many moods.\r\n\r\nEager anticipation of the new unseen world beyond, exultation in\r\nfinding herself somebody, sympathy with her mother\'s happiness, all had\r\ntheir share, but they made her all the wilder, because they were far\r\nfrom unmixed.  The instinctive dislike of Mr. Egremont\'s countenance,\r\nand doubt of his plausible story, which had vanished before his\r\npresence, and her mother\'s faith, returned upon her from time to time,\r\ncaught perhaps from her aunt\'s tone and looks.  Then her aunt had been\r\nlike a mother to her--her own mother much more like a sister, and the\r\nquitting her was a wrench not compensated for as in Mrs. Egremont\'s\r\ncase by a more absorbing affection.  Moreover, Nuttie felt sure that\r\npoor Gerard Godfrey would break his heart.  As the mother and daughter\r\nfor the last time lay down together in the room that had been theirs\r\nthrough the seventeen years of the girl\'s life, Alice fell asleep with\r\na look of exquisite peace and content on her face, feeling her long\r\nterm of trial crowned by unlooked-for joy, while Ursula, though\r\nrespecting her slumbers too much to move, lay with wide-open eyes, now\r\nspeculating on the strange future, now grieving over those she\r\nleft--Aunt Ursel, Gerard, Mary, and all such; the schemes from which\r\nshe was snatched, and then again consoling herself with the hope that,\r\nsince she was going to be rich, she could at once give all that was\r\nwanted--the white altar cloth, the brass pitcher--nay, perhaps finish\r\nthe church and build the school!  For had not some one said something\r\nabout her position?  Oh yes, she had not thought of it before, but,\r\nsince she was the elder brother\'s daughter, she must be the heiress!\r\nThere was no doubt a grand beautiful story before her; she would\r\nwithstand all sorts of fascinations, wicked baronets and earls\r\ninnumerable, and come back and take Gerard by the hand, and say, \'Pride\r\nwas quelled and love was free.\'  Not that Gerard had ever uttered a\r\nword tending in that direction since he had been seven years old, but\r\nthat would make it all the prettier; they would both be silently\r\nconstant, till the time came, perhaps when she was of age.  Mother\r\nwould like it, though _that_ father would certainly be horrid.  And how\r\nnice it would be to give Gerard everything, and they would go all over\r\nthe Continent, and see pictures, and buy them, and see all the\r\ncathedrals and all the mountains.  But perhaps, since Mark Egremont had\r\nreally been so generous in hunting up the cousin who was displacing\r\nhim, she was bound in duty to marry him; perhaps he reckoned on her\r\ndoing so.  She would be generous in her turn, give up all the wealth to\r\nhim, and return to do and be everything to Micklethwayte.  How they\r\nwould admire and bless her.  And oh! she was going to London\r\nto-morrow--London, which she so much wished to see--Westminster Abbey,\r\nBritish Museum, All Saints, National Gallery, no end of new dresses.\r\n\r\nHalf-waking, half-dreaming, she spent the night which seemed long\r\nenough, and the light hours of the summer morning seemed still longer,\r\nbefore she could call it a reasonable time for getting up. Her\r\nsplashings  awoke her mother, who lay smiling for a few moments,\r\nrealising and giving thanks for her great joy, then bestirred herself\r\nwith the recollection of all that had to be done on this busy morning\r\nbefore any summons from her husband could arrive.\r\n\r\nCombining packing and dressing, like the essentially unmethodical\r\nlittle woman she was, Mrs. Egremont still had all her beautiful silky\r\nbrown hair about her shoulders when the bell of St. Ambrose\'s was heard\r\ngiving its thin tinkling summons to matins at half-past seven. She was\r\ndisappointed; she meant to have gone for this last time, but there was\r\nno help for it, and Nuttie set off by herself.\r\n\r\nGerard Godfrey was at his own door.  He was not one of the regular\r\nattendants at the short service, being of that modern species that\r\nholds itself superior to \'Cranmer\'s prayers,\' but on this morning he\r\nhastened up to her with outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\'And you are going away!\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'I hope to get leave to stay a few days after mother,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'To prolong the torment?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'To wish everybody good-bye.  It is a great piece of my life that is\r\ncome to an end, and I can\'t bear to break it off so short.\'\r\n\r\n\'And if you feel so, who are going to wealth and pleasure, what must it\r\nbe to those who are left behind?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' said Nuttie, \'some one will be raised up.  That\'s what they\r\nalways say.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall go into a brotherhood,\' observed Gerard desperately.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t,\' began Nuttie, much gratified, but at that moment Miss\r\nNugent came out at her door, and Mr. Spyers, who was some way in\r\nadvance, looked round and waited for them to come up.  He held out his\r\nhands to her and said, \'Well, Nuttie, my child, you are going to begin\r\na new life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh dear!  I wish I could have both!\' cried Nuttie, not very relevantly\r\nas far as the words went.\r\n\r\n\'Scheiden und weiden thut weh!\' quoted Mary.\r\n\r\n\'If his place was only Monks Horton.  What will Aunt Ursel do?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think perhaps she may be induced to join us,\' said Mary.  \'We mean\r\nto do our best to persuade her.\'\r\n\r\n\'And there\'s the choir!  And my class, and the harmonium,\' went on\r\nNuttie, while Gerard walked on disconsolately.\r\n\r\n\'Micklethwayte has existed without you, Nuttie,\' said Mr. Spyers,\r\ntaking her on with him alone.  \'Perhaps it will be able to do so again.\r\nMy dear, you had better look on.  There will be plenty for you to learn\r\nand to do where you are going, and you will be sure to find much to\r\nenjoy, and also something to bear.  I should like to remind you that\r\nthe best means of going on well in this new world will be to keep self\r\ndown and to have the strong desire that only love can give to be\r\nsubmissive, and to do what is right both to God and your father and\r\nmother.  May I give you a text to take with you? "Children, obey your\r\nparents in the Lord, for this is right."\'\r\n\r\nThey were at the door and there was no time for an answer, but Nuttie,\r\nas she took her place, was partly touched and partly fretted at the\r\nadmonition.\r\n\r\nThe question as to her remaining a day or two after her mother was soon\r\ndisposed of.  Mrs. Egremont sent a pretty little note to make the\r\nrequest, but the elegant valet who appeared at ten o\'clock brought a\r\nverbal message that his master wished Mrs. and Miss Egremont to be\r\nready by two o\'clock to join him in calling on Lady Kirkaldy at Monks\r\nHorton, and that if their luggage was ready by four o\'clock, he\r\n(Gregorio) would take charge of it, as they were all to go up to town\r\nby the 4.40 train.\r\n\r\n\'Did he have my note?\' faltered Alice, stimulated by the imploring\r\nglances of aunt and daughter, but anticipating the answer.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, madame, but he wishes that Miss Egremont should accompany you\r\nimmediately.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course,\' was Alice\'s comment, \'now that he has found his child, he\r\ncannot bear to part with her.\'\r\n\r\nAnd all through the farewells that almost rent the gentle Alice\'s heart\r\nin two, she was haunted by the terror that she or her daughter should\r\nhave red eyes to vex her husband.  As to Mr. Dutton, he had only come\r\nin with Gerard in a great hurry just after breakfast, said there was\r\nmuch to do to-day at the office, as they were going to take stock, and\r\nthey should neither of them have time to come home to luncheon.  He\r\nshook the hands of mother and daughter heartily, promised to \'look\r\nafter\' Miss Headworth, and bore off in his train young Gerard, looking\r\nthe picture of woe, and muttering \'I believe he has got it up on\r\npurpose;\' while mother and daughter thought it very odd, and rather\r\nunkind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nNEW PLUMES.\r\n\r\n  \'And ye sall walk in silk attire,\r\n  And siller hae to spare.\'--Old Ballad.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very best open fly and pair of horses, being the equipage most like\r\na private carriage possessed by the Royal Hotel, came to the door with\r\nMr. Egremont seated in it, at a few minutes after two o\'clock, and\r\nfound Alice in her only black silk, with a rose in her bonnet, and a\r\ntie to match on her neck, hastily procured as signs of her wifehood.\r\n\r\nShe had swallowed her tears, and Nuttie was not a crying person, but\r\nwas perfectly scarlet on her usually brown cheeks.  Her father muttered\r\nsome civility about back seats, but it was plain that it was only in\r\nwords, and she never thought of anything but looking back, with her\r\nlast wave to her aunt and the two maids, one crying at the gate, the\r\nother at the door.\r\n\r\n\'There,\' said Mr. Egremont, as they drove away, \'that is over!\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear aunt,\' said his wife.  \'Who can express her goodness to me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Cela va sans dire,\' was the reply.  \'But these are connections that\r\nhappily Ursula is young enough to forget and leave behind.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall never forget!\' began Nuttie, but she saw her father composing\r\nhimself in his corner without paying the slightest heed to what she was\r\nsaying, and she encountered a warning and alarmed glance from her\r\nmother, so she was forced to content herself with uttering silent vows\r\nof perpetual recollection as she passed each well-known object,--the\r\nunfinished church, with Mr. Spyers at the door talking to old Bellman;\r\nthe Town Hall, whose concerts, lectures, and S. P. G. meetings had been\r\nher chief gaiety and excitement; the School of Art, where Lady\r\nKirkaldy\'s appearance now seemed to her to have been like that of a\r\nbird of omen; past the shops in the High Street, with a little\r\nexultation at the thought of past desires which they had excited.  Long\r\ncould she have rattled away, her hopes contradicting her regrets, and\r\nher regrets qualifying her anticipations, but she saw that her mother\r\nwas nervous about every word and gesture, and fairly looked dismayed\r\nwhen she exclaimed, \'Oh, mother, there\'s Etta Smith; how surprised she\r\nwill be!\' bowing and smiling with all her might.\r\n\r\nThere was a look of bare toleration on Mr. Egremont\'s face, as if he\r\nendured because it would soon be over, as Nuttie bowed several times,\r\nand his wife, though less quick to catch people\'s eyes, sometimes also\r\nmade her recognition.  When the streets were past and Nuttie had aimed\r\nher last nods at the nursery parties out walking on the road, she\r\nbecame aware that those cold, lack-lustre, and yet sharply critical\r\neyes of her father were scanning her all over.\r\n\r\n\'She has been educated?\' he presently said to his wife.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes,\' was the eager answer.  \'She is in the highest form at the\r\nHigh School, and has to go up for the Senior Local Examination.  Miss\r\nBelper makes sure that she will get a first class.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Egremont gave a little wave of the hand, as dismissing something\r\nsuperfluous, and said, \'I hope she has some accomplishments.\'\r\n\r\n\'She has done very fairly in French and German--\'\r\n\r\n\'And Latin,\' put in Ursula.\r\n\r\n\'And she has had several prizes at the School of Art.\'\r\n\r\n\'And music?  That\'s the only thing of any value in society,\' he said\r\nimpatiently, and Mrs. Egremont said more timidly, \'She has learnt music\r\nregularly.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I don\'t care about it,\' broke in Nuttie.  \'I haven\'t mother\'s ear\r\nnor her voice.  I learnt the science in case I should have to teach,\r\nand they make me practise.  I don\'t mind classical music, but I can\'t\r\nstand rubbish, and I think it is waste of time.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Egremont looked fairly amused, as at the outspoken folly of an\r\nenfant terrible, but he only said, either to his wife or to himself, \'A\r\nlittle polish, and then she may be fairly presentable.\'\r\n\r\n\'We have taken great pains with her,\' answered the gentle mother,\r\nevidently taking this as a great compliment, while the daughter was\r\ntingling with indignation.  She, bred up by mother, and aunt, and Mary\r\nNugent, to be barely presentable.  Was not their society at\r\nMicklethwayte equal in good manners to any, and superior, far superior,\r\nin goodness and intelligence to these stupid fashionable people, who\r\nundervalued all her real useful acquirements, and cared for nothing but\r\ntrumpery music.\r\n\r\nThe carriage entered the park, and Nuttie saw lake and woods from a\r\nfresh point of view.  The owners were both at home, and Nuttie found\r\nherself walking behind her parents into a cheerful apartment, half\r\nlibrary, half morning-room.  Mrs. Egremont was by far the most shy and\r\nshrinking of the party, but it was an occasion that showed her\r\nhusband\'s complete tact and savoir favre.  He knew perfectly well that\r\nthe Kirkaldys knew all about it, and he therefore took the initiative.\r\n\'You are surprised to see us,\' he said, as he gave his hand, \'but we\r\ncould not leave the country without coming to thank Lady Kirkaldy for\r\nher kindness in assisting in following up the clue to Mrs. Egremont\'s\r\nresidence.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am very happy,\' said Lady Kirkaldy, while all were being seated.\r\n\r\n\'I think it was here that my nephew Mark first met one whom, child as\r\nhe was, he could not but remember.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think you met him here,\' said Lady Kirkaldy to Mrs. Egremont;\r\n\'but he heard the name and was struck by it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear Mark!\' was the response.  \'He was so kind.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is a dear good boy,\' chimed in my lady.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said her lord, \'an excellent good fellow with plenty of brains.\'\r\n\r\n\'As he well knows,\' said Mr. Egremont.  \'Oh yes; I quite agree with all\r\nyou say of him!  One ought to be thankful for the possession of a rare\r\nspecimen.\'\r\n\r\nIt was in the tone in which Falstaff discussed that sober boy, Lord\r\nJohn of Lancaster.  Lord Kirkaldy asked if the visitors were going to\r\nremain long in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\'We are due in London to-night,\' replied Mr. Egremont.  \'We shall spend\r\na day or two there, and then go home.  Alice,\' he added, though his\r\nwife had never heard him call her so before, \'Lady Kirkaldy knows your\r\ninexperience.  Perhaps she would be good enough to give you some\r\naddresses that might be useful.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall be delighted,\' said the lady, cordially looking at the\r\nblushing Mrs. Egremont.\r\n\r\n\'Dressmaker, and all the rest of it,\' said Mr. Egremont.  \'You know\r\nbetter than she does what she will require, and a little advice will be\r\ninvaluable.  Above all, if you could tell her how to pick up a maid.\'\r\n\r\nLady Kirkaldy proposed to take the mother and daughter up to her\r\ndressing-room, where she kept her book of addresses to London\r\ntradesmen; and Mr. Egremont only begged that they would remember the\r\n4.40 train.  Then Lord Kirkaldy was left to entertain him, while the\r\nladies went up the broad staircase to the pleasant room, which had a\r\nmingled look of refinement and usefulness which struck Nuttie at once.\r\nLady Kirkaldy, as soon as the door was shut, took her visitor by the\r\nhand, kissed her forehead, and said, \'You must let me tell you how glad\r\nI am.\'\r\n\r\nThe crystal veil at once spread over Alice\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, thank you. Lady Kirkaldy!  I am _so_ happy, and yet I am so\r\nafraid.  Please tell me what we shall _do_ so that we may not vex him,\r\nso high bred and fastidious as he is?\'\r\n\r\n\'Be yourself!  That\'s all, my dear,\' said Lady Kirkaldy tenderly.\r\n\'Don\'t be afraid.  You are quite incapable of doing anything that could\r\ndistress the most fastidious taste.\'\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly true of the mother, perhaps less so of the daughter;\r\nbut Lady Kirkaldy only thought of her as a mere girl, who could easily\r\nbe modelled by her surroundings.  The kind hostess applied herself to\r\ngiving the addresses of the people she thought likely to be most useful\r\nin the complete outfit which she saw would be necessary, explaining to\r\nwhich establishments she applied with confidence if she needed to\r\ncomplete her wardrobe in haste, feeling certain that nothing would be\r\nsent her that she disliked, and giving leave to use her name.  She soon\r\nsaw that the mother was a little dazed, while Ursula\'s eyes grew\r\nrounder at the unlimited vista of fine clothes, and she assented, and\r\nasked questions as to the details.  As to a maid, Lady Kirkaldy would\r\nwrite to a person who would call on Mrs. Egremont at the hotel in\r\nLondon, and who might be what was wanted; and in conclusion, Lady\r\nKirkaldy, with some diffidence, begged to be written to--\'if--if,\' she\r\nsaid, \'there happened to be any difficulty about which you might not\r\nlike to consult Mrs. William Egremont.\'  Nuttie hardly knew whether to\r\nbe grateful or not, for she did not believe in any standard above that\r\nof Micklethwayte, and she was almost angry at her mother\'s grateful\r\nanswer--\'Oh, thank you!  I should be so grateful!  I am so afraid of\r\nannoying him by what he may think small, ignorant, country-town ways!\r\nYou will understand--\'\r\n\r\nLady Kirkaldy did understand, and she dreaded what might be before the\r\nsweet little yielding woman, not from want of breeding so much as from\r\nthe long-indulged selfishness of her husband; but she encouraged her as\r\nmuch as possible, and promised all possible counsel, bringing her\r\ndownstairs again just in time.\r\n\r\n\'Pretty little soul!\' said Lord Kirkaldy, as the fly clattered away. \'I\r\nwonder whether Mark has done her a kindness!\'\r\n\r\n\'It is just what she is, a pretty, nay, a beautiful soul, full of\r\ntenderness and forgiveness and affection and humility, only I doubt\r\nwhether there is any force or resolution to hold her own.  You smile!\r\nWell, perhaps the less of that she has the better she may get on with\r\nhim.  Did he say anything about her?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I think he wants to ignore that they have not spent the last\r\ntwenty years together.\'\r\n\r\n\'That may be the best way for all parties.  Do you think he will behave\r\nwell to her?\'\r\n\r\n\'No man could well do otherwise to such a sweet little thing,\' said\r\nLord Kirkaldy; \'especially as she will be his most obedient slave, and\r\nwill make herself necessary to him.  It is much better luck than he\r\ndeserves; but I pity her when she comes to make her way with yon\r\nladies!\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish I was there!  I know she will let herself be trodden on!\r\nHowever, there\'s Mark to stand up for her, and William Egremont will do\r\nwhatever he thinks right and just.  I wish I knew how his wife will\r\ntake it!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nBRIDGEFIELD EGREMONT.\r\n\r\n  \'Let us see these handsome houses\r\n  Where the wealthy nobles dwell.\'--TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Mother, mother!\' cried two young people, bursting open the door of the\r\npretty dining-room of Bridgefield Rectory, where the grown-up part of\r\nthe family were lingering over a late breakfast.\r\n\r\n\'Gently, gently, children,\' said the dignified lady at the head of the\r\ntable.  \'Don\'t disturb papa.\'\r\n\r\n\'But we really have something to say, mother!\' said the elder girl,\r\n\'and Fraulein said you ought to know.  Uncle Alwyn is come home, and\r\nMrs. Egremont.  And please, are we to call her Aunt Egremont, or Aunt\r\nAlwyn, or what?\'\r\n\r\nThe desired sensation was produced.  Canon Egremont put down his\r\nnewspaper.  The two elder sisters looked from one to the other in\r\nunmitigated astonishment.  Mark briefly made answer to the final\r\nquestion, \'Aunt Alice,\' and Mrs. Egremont said gravely, \'How did you\r\nhear this, Rosalind?  You know I always forbid you to gossip.\'\r\n\r\n\'We didn\'t gossip, mother.  We went up to the gardens to get some\r\nmulberries for our half-holiday feast; and Ronaldson came out and told\r\nus we must ask leave first, for the ladies were come.  The Squire came\r\nhome at nine o\'clock last night, and Mrs. Egremont and all, and only\r\nsent a telegram two hours before to have the rooms got ready.\'\r\n\r\n\'Has Uncle Alwyn gone and got himself married?\' exclaimed one of the\r\nyoung ladies, in utter amazement.\r\n\r\n\'Not just now, Blanche,\' said her father.  \'It is an old story now.\r\nYour uncle married this lady, who had been governess to May and Mark,\r\nmany years ago, and from--circumstances in which she was not at all to\r\nblame, he lost sight of her while he was abroad with old General\r\nEgremont.  Mark met her about a fortnight ago, and this has led to your\r\nuncle\'s going in quest of her, though he has certainly been more sudden\r\nin his proceedings than I expected.\'\r\n\r\nThe mother here succeeded in sending Rosalind and Adela, with their\r\nwondering eyes, off the scene, and she would much have liked to send\r\nher two stepdaughters after them, but one-and-twenty and eighteen could\r\nnot so readily be ordered off as twelve and ten; and Mark, who had been\r\nprohibited from uttering a word to his sisters, was eagerly examining\r\nMargaret whether she remembered their Edda; but she had been only three\r\nyears old at the time of the adventures in the Isle of Wight, and\r\nremembered nothing distinctly but the aspect of one of the sailors in\r\nthe yacht.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Mrs. Egremont, \'this has come very suddenly upon us.  It\r\nwould have been more for her own dignity if she had held out a little\r\nbefore coming so easily to terms, after the way in which she has been\r\ntreated.\'\r\n\r\n\'When you see her, mother, you will understand,\' said Mark.\r\n\r\n\'Shall we have to be intimate with her?\' asked May.\r\n\r\n\'I desire that she should be treated as a relation,\' said the Canon\r\ndecidedly.  \'There is nothing against her character,\' and, as his wife\r\nwas about to interrupt,--\'nothing but an indiscretion to which she was\r\nalmost driven many years ago.  She was cruelly treated, and I for one\r\nam heartily sorry for having let myself be guided by others.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. William Egremont felt somewhat complacent, for she knew he meant\r\nLady de Lyonnais, and there certainly had been no love lost between her\r\nand her step-children\'s grandmother; but she was a sensible woman, and\r\nforbore to speak, though there was a mental reservation that intimacy\r\nwould a good deal depend upon circumstances.  Blanche cried out that it\r\nwas a perfect romance, and May gravely said, \'But is she a lady?\'\r\n\r\n\'A perfect lady,\' said Mark.  \'Aunt Margaret says so.\'\r\n\r\n\'One knows what a perfect lady means,\' returned May.\r\n\r\n\'Come, May,\' said Mrs. Egremont, \'do not let us begin with a prejudice.\r\nBy all accounts the poor thing has conducted herself with perfect\r\nrespectability all this time.  What did you tell me, Mark? She has been\r\nliving with an aunt, keeping a school at Micklethwayte.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not quite,\' said Mark.  \'She has been acting as a daily governess. She\r\nseemed to be on friendly terms with the clerical folk.  I came across\r\nthe name at a school feast, or something of the kind, which came off in\r\nthe Kirkaldys\' park.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, then, I know exactly the sort of person!\' returned May, pursing up\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\nMark laughed and said, \'I wonder whether it is too soon to go up and\r\nsee them.  I wonder what my uncle thinks of his daughter.\'\r\n\r\n\'What!  You don\'t mean to say there is a daughter?\' cried May.\r\n\r\n\'Even so.  And exactly like you too, Miss May.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you are cut out, Mark!\'\r\n\r\n\'You are cut out, I think, May.  You\'ll have to give her all your Miss\r\nEgremont cards.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said the young lady; \'mother made me have my Christian name\r\nprinted.  She said all but the daughters of the head of the family\r\nought to have it so.  I\'m glad of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'How old is she?\' asked Blanche.\r\n\r\n\'About a year younger than you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think it is very interesting,\' said Blanche.  \'How wonderful it must\r\nall be to her!  I will go up with you, Mark, as soon as I can get\r\nready.\'\r\n\r\n\'You had better wait till later in the day, Blanche,\' said the mother.\r\nShe knew the meeting was inevitable, but she preferred having it under\r\nher own eye, if she could not reconnoitre.\r\n\r\nShe was a just and sensible woman, who felt reparation due to the\r\nnewly-discovered sister-in-law, and that harmony, or at least the\r\nappearance of it, must be preserved; but she was also exclusive and\r\nfastidious by nature, and did not look forward to the needful\r\nintercourse with much satisfaction either on her own account or that of\r\nher family.\r\n\r\nShe told Mark to say that she should come to see Mrs. Egremont after\r\nluncheon, since he was determined to go at once, and moreover to drag\r\nhis father with him.  Canon Egremont was a good and upright man,\r\naccording to his lights, which were rather those of a well-beneficed\r\nclergyman of the first than of the last half of the century,\r\nintensified perhaps that the passive voice was the strongest in him.\r\nAll the country knew that Canon Egremont could be relied on to give a\r\nprudent, scholarly judgment, and to be kind and liberal, when once\r\ninduced to stir mind or body--but how to do that was the problem.  He\r\nhad not been a young man at the time of his first marriage, and was\r\nonly a few years\' junior to his brother, though he had the fresh,\r\nwholesome look of a man who kept regular hours and lived much in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAlice knew him at once, and thought eighteen years had made little\r\nchange, as, at Nuttie\'s call to her, she looked from the window and saw\r\nthe handsome, dignified, gray-haired, close-shaven rosy face, and the\r\nclerical garb unchanged in favour of long coats and high waistcoats.\r\n\r\nThe mother and daughter were exploring the house together.  Mr.\r\nEgremont had made it known that he preferred having his breakfast\r\nalone, and not being disturbed in the forenoon.  So the two ladies had\r\nbreakfasted together at nine, the earliest hour at which they could\r\nprevail on the household to give them a meal.  Indeed Nuttie had slept\r\ntill nearly that time, for between excitement and noise, her London\r\nslumbers had been broken; and her endeavour to keep Micklethwayte hours\r\nhad resulted in a long, weary, hungry time in the sitting-room of the\r\nhotel, with nothing to do, when the gaze from the window palled on her,\r\nbut to write to her aunt and Mary Nugent.  The rest of the day had been\r\nspent in driving about in a brougham with her mother shopping, and this\r\nshe could not but enjoy exceedingly, more than did the timid Mrs.\r\nEgremont, who could not but feel herself weighted with responsibility;\r\nand never having had to spend at the utmost more than ten pounds at a\r\ntime, felt bewildered at the cheques put into her hands, and then was\r\nalarmed to find them melting away faster than she expected.\r\n\r\nThere was a very late dinner, after which Mr. Egremont, on the first\r\nday, made his wife play bezique with him.  She enjoyed it, as a tender\r\nreminiscence of the yachting days; but Nuttie found herself de trop,\r\nand was reduced to the book she had contrived to purchase on her\r\ntravels.  The second night Mr. Egremont had picked up two friends, not\r\nyet gone out of town, whose talk was of horses and of yachts, quite\r\nincomprehensible to the ladies.  They were very attentive to Mrs.\r\nEgremont, whom they evidently admired, one so visibly as to call up a\r\nblush; but they disregarded the daughter as a schoolgirl.  Happily they\r\nappeared no more after the dinner; but Nuttie\'s first exclamation of\r\nastonished disgust was silenced at once by her mother with unusual\r\ndetermination, \'You must not speak so of your father\'s friends.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not when--\'\r\n\r\n\'Not at all,\' interrupted Mrs. Egremont.\r\n\r\nThe only sense of promotion to greatness that Ursula had yet enjoyed\r\nwas in these fine clothes, and the maid whom Lady Kirkaldy had\r\nrecommended, a grave and severe-looking person, of whom both stood\r\nsomewhat in awe.  The arrival at Bridgefield had been too late for\r\nanything to be taken in but a general impression of space and\r\ndreariness, and the inevitable dinner of many courses, after which\r\nNuttie was so tired out that her mother sent her to bed.\r\n\r\nSince the waking she had made some acquaintance with the house. There\r\nwas no show of domestics, no curtseying housekeeper to parade the new\r\nmistress over the house; Mr. Egremont had told his wife that she must\r\nfill up the establishment as she pleased, but that there was an\r\nadmirable cook downstairs, and he would not have her interfered\r\nwith--she suited his tastes as no one else did, and she must be left to\r\ndeal with the provisions and her own underlings.  There was a stable\r\nestablishment, and a footman had been hired in town, but there was\r\nbesides only one untidy-looking housemaid, who began by giving warning;\r\nand Alice and Nuttie had roamed about without meeting any one from the\r\nbig wainscotted dining-room with faded crimson curtains and family\r\nportraits, the older grimy, the younger chalky, to the two\r\ndrawing-rooms, whose gilding and pale blue damask had been preserved by\r\npinafores of brown holland; the library, which looked and smelt as if\r\nMr. Egremont was in the habit of sitting there, and a big\r\nbilliard-room, all opening into a shivery-feeling hall, with Scagliola\r\ncolumns and a few dirty statues between them; then upstairs to a\r\npossible morning-room, looking out over a garden lawn, where mowing was\r\ngoing on in haste, and suites of dreary shut-up fusty bedrooms.\r\nNuttie, who had notions of choosing her own bower, could not make up\r\nher mind which looked the least inviting.  It did not seem as if girls\r\ncould ever have laughed together, or children clattered up and down the\r\nstairs.  Mrs. Egremont begged her to keep possession for the present at\r\nleast of the chamber where the grim housemaid had chosen to put her,\r\nand which had the advantage of being aired.\r\n\r\nThe two windows looked out over the park, and thence it was that while\r\nMorris, the maid, was unpacking and putting away the new purchases, and\r\nNuttie was standing, scarcely realising that such pretty hats and\r\nbonnets could be her very own, when her mother beheld the Canon and\r\nMark advancing up the drive.  It was with a great start that she called\r\nUrsula to come down directly with her, as no one would know where to\r\nfind them, hastily washing the hands that had picked up a sense of\r\ndustiness during the exploration, and taking a comprehensive glance in\r\nthe cheval glass, which showed her some one she felt entirely\r\nunfamiliar to her in a dainty summer costume of pale gray silk picked\r\nout with a mysterious shade of pink.  Ursula too thought Miss\r\nEgremont\'s outer woman more like a Chelsea shepherdess than Nuttie\'s\r\ntrue self, as she tripped along in her buckled shoes and the sea green\r\nstockings that had been sent home with her skirt.  With crimson cheeks\r\nand a throbbing heart, Alice was only just at the foot of the stairs\r\nwhen the newcomers had made their way in, and the kind Canon, ignoring\r\nall that was past, held out his hands saying, \'Well, my dear, I am glad\r\nto see you here,\' kissing Mrs. Egremont on each cheek.  \'And so this is\r\nyour daughter.  How do you do, my dear--Ursula?  Isn\'t that your name?\'\r\nAnd Ursula had again to submit to a kiss, much more savoury and kindly\r\nthan her father\'s, though very stubbly.  And oh! her uncle\'s dress was\r\nlike that of no one she had ever seen except the rector of the old\r\nchurch, the object of unlimited contempt to the adherents of St.\r\nAmbrose\'s.\r\n\r\nAs to Mark, he only kissed his aunt, and shook hands with her, while\r\nhis father ran on with an unusual loquacity that was a proof of\r\nnervousness in him.\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Egremont--Jane, I mean--will be here after luncheon.  She thought\r\nyou would like to get settled in first.  How is Alwyn?  Is he down yet?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will see,\' in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, never mind, Alwyn hates to be disturbed till he has made\r\nhimself up in the morning.  My call is on you, you know.  Where are you\r\nsitting?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t quite know.  In the drawing-room, I suppose.\'\r\n\r\nThe Canon, knowing the house much better than she did, opened a door\r\ninto a third drawing-room she had not yet seen, a pretty little room,\r\nfitted up with fluted silk, like a tent, somewhat faded but not much\r\nthe worse for that, and opening into a conservatory, which seemed to\r\nhave little in it but some veteran orange trees.  Nuttie, however,\r\nexclaimed with pleasure at the nicest room she had seen, and Mark began\r\nunfastening the glass door that led into it.  Meantime Alice, with\r\nburning cheeks and liquid eyes, nerved her voice to say, \'Oh, sir--Mr.\r\nEgremont--please forgive me!  I know now how wrong I was.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, my dear.  Bygones are bygones.  You were far more sinned\r\nagainst than sinning, and have much to forgive me.  There, my dear, we\r\nwill say no more about it, nor think of it either.  I am only too\r\nthankful that poor Alwyn should have some one to look after him.\'\r\n\r\nAlice, who had dreaded nothing more than the meeting with her former\r\nmaster, was infinitely relieved and grateful for this kindness.  She\r\nhad ejaculated, \'Oh, you are so good!\' in the midst, and now at the\r\nmention of her husband, she exclaimed, \'Oh! do you think he is ill? I\r\ncan\'t help being afraid he is, but he will not tell me, and does not\r\nlike to be asked.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor fellow, he has damaged his health a good deal,\' was the answer.\r\n\'He had a sharp attack in the spring, but he has pretty well got over\r\nit, and Raikes told me there was no reason for uneasiness, provided he\r\nwould be careful; and that will be a much easier matter now.  I should\r\nnot wonder if we saw him with quite a renewed youth.\'\r\n\r\nSo the Canon and Mrs. Egremont were getting on pretty well together,\r\nbut there was much more stiffness and less cordiality between the two\r\ncousins, although Mark got the window open into the conservatory, and\r\nshowed Nuttie the way into the garden, advising her to ask Ronaldson,\r\nthe gardener, to fill the conservatory with flowers.  The pavilion, as\r\nthis little room was called, always seemed to have more capacities for\r\nbeing lived in than any other room in the house.  It had been fitted up\r\nwhen such things were the fashion for the shortlived bride of \'our\r\ngreat uncle.\'\r\n\r\n\'The colour must have been awful then,\' said Mark, looking up at it,\r\n\'enough to set one\'s teeth on edge; but it has faded into something\r\nquite orthodox--much better than could be manufactured for you.\'\r\n\r\nMark had evidently some ideas of art, and was besides inclined to do\r\nthe honours to the stranger; but Nuttie was not going to encourage him\r\nor anybody else to make up to her, while she had that look of Gerard\r\nGodfrey\'s in her mind\'s eye.  So she made small answer, and he felt\r\nrebuffed, but supposed her shy, and wondered when he could go back to\r\nher mother, who was so much more attractive.\r\n\r\nPresently his father went off to storm the den of the master of the\r\nhouse, and there was a pleasant quarter of an hour, during which the\r\nthree went out through the conservatory, and Mark showed the\r\nins-and-outs of the garden, found out Ronaldson, and congratulated him\r\non having some one at last to appreciate his flowers, begging him to\r\nmake the conservatory beautiful.  And Mrs. Egremont\'s smile was so\r\neffective that the Scot forthwith took out his knife and presented her\r\nwith the most precious of the roses within his reach.\r\n\r\nMoreover Mark told the names and ages of all his sisters, whole and\r\nhalf.  He was the only son, except a little fellow in the nursery. And\r\nhe exhorted his aunt not to be afraid of his step-mother, who was a\r\nmost excellent person, he declared, but who never liked to see any one\r\nafraid of her.\r\n\r\nThere was something a little alarming in this, but on the whole the\r\nvisit was very pleasant and encouraging to Mrs. Egremont; and she began\r\nrejoicing over the kindness as soon as the Canon had summoned his son,\r\nand they had gone away together.\r\n\r\n\'I am sure you must be delighted with your uncle and cousin, my dear,\'\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s not a bit my notion of a priest,\' returned Nuttie.  \'And I don\'t\r\nbelieve he has any daily prayers!\'\r\n\r\n\'He is old-fashioned, my dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'One of the stodgey old clergymen in books,\' observed Nuttie.  \'I\r\ndidn\'t think there were any of that sort left.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, my dear, pray don\'t take fancies into your head!  He is a very,\r\nvery good man, and has been most kind to me, far more than I deserve,\r\nand he is your uncle, Nuttie.  I do so hope you will get on well with\r\nyour cousins.\'\r\n\r\nHere a gong, a perfectly unknown sound to Nuttie, made itself heard,\r\nand rather astonished her by the concluding roar.  The two ladies came\r\nout into the hall as Mr. Egremont was crossing it.  He made an\r\ninclination of the head, and uttered a sort of good morning to his\r\ndaughter, but she was perfectly content to have no closer salutation.\r\nHaving a healthy noonday appetite, her chief wish was at the moment\r\nthat those beautiful little cutlets, arranged in a crown form, were not\r\nso very tiny; or that, with two men-servants looking on, it were\r\npossible to attain to a second help, but she had already learnt that\r\nGregorio would not hear her, and that any attempt to obtain more food\r\nfrightened her mother.\r\n\r\n\'So his reverence has been to see you,\' observed Mr. Egremont.\r\n\'William, if you like it better.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, and he was kindness itself!\'\r\n\r\n\'And how did Master Mark look at finding I could dispense with his\r\nassistance?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think he is very glad.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Egremont laughed.  \'You are a simple woman, Edda!  The pose of\r\nvirtuous hero was to have been full compensation for all that it might\r\ncost him!  And no doubt he looks for the reward of virtue likewise.\'\r\n\r\nWherewith he looked full at Ursula, who, to her extreme vexation, felt\r\nherself blushing up to the ears.  She fidgeted on her chair, and began\r\na most untrue \'I\'m sure--\' for, indeed, the poor girl was sure of\r\nnothing, but that her father\'s manner was most uncomfortable to her.\r\nHis laugh choked whatever she might have said, which perhaps was well,\r\nand her mother\'s cheeks glowed as much as hers did.\r\n\r\n\'Did the Canoness--Jane, I mean--come up?\' Mr. Egremont went on.\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Egremont?  No; she sent word that she is coming after luncheon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hm!  Then I shall ride out and leave you to her majesty.  Now look\r\nyou, Alice, you are to be very careful with William\'s wife.  She is a\r\nCondamine, you know, and thinks no end of herself, and your position\r\namong the women-folk of the county depends more on how she takes you up\r\nthan anything else.  But that doesn\'t mean that you are to let her give\r\nherself airs and domineer over you.  Remember you are the elder\r\nbrother\'s wife--Mrs. Egremont of Bridgefield Egremont--and she is\r\nnothing but a parson\'s wife, and I won\'t have her meddling in my house.\r\nOnly don\'t you be absurd and offend her, for she can do more for or\r\nagainst you in society than any one else--more\'s the pity!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! won\'t you stay and help me receive her?\' exclaimed the poor lady,\r\nutterly confused by these contrary directions.\r\n\r\n\'Not I!  I can\'t abide the woman! nor she me!\'  He added, after a\r\nmoment, \'You will do better without me.\'\r\n\r\nSo he went out for his ride, and Ursula asked, \'Oh, mother! what will\r\nyou do?\'\r\n\r\n\'The best I can, my dear.  They are good people, and are sure to be\r\nkinder than I deserve.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie was learning that her mother would never so much as hear, far\r\nless answer, a remark on her husband.  It was beginning to make a sore\r\nin the young heart that a barrier was thus rising, where there once had\r\nbeen as perfect oneness and confidence as could exist between two\r\nnatures so dissimilar, though hitherto the unlikeness had never made\r\nitself felt.\r\n\r\nMrs. Egremont turned the conversation to the establishing themselves in\r\nthe pavilion, whither she proceeded to import some fancy-work that she\r\nhad bought in London, and sent Nuttie to Ronaldson, who was arranging\r\ncalceolarias, begonias, and geraniums in the conservatory, to beg for\r\nsome cut-flowers for a great dusty-looking vase in the centre of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThese were being arranged when Mrs. William Egremont and Miss Blanche\r\nEgremont were ushered in, and there were the regular kindred embraces,\r\nafter which Alice and Nuttie were aware of a very handsome,\r\ndignified-looking lady, well though simply dressed in what was\r\nevidently her home costume, with a large shady hat and feather, her\r\nwhole air curiously fitting the imposing nickname of the Canoness.\r\nBlanche was a slight, delicate-looking, rather pretty girl in a\r\nlawn-tennis dress.  The visitor took the part of treating the newcomers\r\nas well-established relations.\r\n\r\n\'We would not inundate you all at once,\' she said, \'but the children\r\nare all very eager to see their cousin.  I wish you would come down to\r\nthe Rectory with me.  My ponies are at the door.  I would drive you,\r\nand Ursula might walk with Blanche.\'  And, as Alice hesitated for a\r\nmoment, considering how this might agree with the complicated\r\ninstructions that she had received, she added, \'Never mind Alwyn.  I\r\nsaw him going off just before I came up, and he told William he was\r\ngoing to look at some horses at Hale\'s, so he is disposed of for a good\r\nmany hours.\'\r\n\r\nAlice decided that her husband would probably wish her to comply, and\r\nshe rejoiced to turn her daughter in among the cousins, so hats,\r\ngloves, and parasols were fetched, and the two mothers drove away with\r\nthe two sleek little toy ponies.  By which it may be perceived that\r\nMrs. William Egremont\'s first impressions were favourable.\r\n\r\n\'It is the shortest way through the gardens,\' said Blanche.  \'Have you\r\nbeen through them yet?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mark walked about with us a little.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll improve them ever so much.  There are great capabilities. Look,\r\nyou could have four tennis courts on this one lawn.  We wanted to have\r\na garden-party up here last year, and father said we might, but mother\r\nthought Uncle Alwyn might think it a liberty; but now you\'ll have some\r\ndelicious ones?  Of course you play lawn-tennis?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have seen it a very few times,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, we must teach you!  Fancy living without lawn-tennis!\' said\r\nBlanche.  \'I always wonder what people did without it.  Only\'--with an\r\neffort at antiquarianism--\'I believe they had croquet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Ursula says there weren\'t garden-parties before croquet came in.\'\r\n\r\n\'How dreadful, Ursula!  Your name\'s Ursula, isn\'t it?  Haven\'t you some\r\njolly little name to go by?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nuttie.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nuttie!  That\'s scrumptious!  I\'ll call you Nuttie, and you may call\r\nme Pussycat.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s not so nice as Blanche.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother won\'t have me called so when strangers are there, but you\r\naren\'t a stranger, you know.  You must tell me all about yourself, and\r\nhow you came never to learn tennis!\'\r\n\r\n\'I had something else to do,\' said Nuttie, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you were in the schoolroom!  I forgot.  Poor little Nuts!\'\r\n\r\n\'At school,\' said Ursula.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, I remember!  But you\'re out now, aren\'t you?  I\'ve been out since\r\nthis spring.  Mother won\'t let us come out till we are eighteen, isn\'t\r\nit horrid?  And we were so worked there!  I can tell you a finishing\r\ngoverness is an awful institution!  Poor little Rosie and Adey will be\r\nin for one by and by.  At present they\'ve only got a jolly little\r\nFraulein that they can do anything they please with.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I wonder if she would tell me of some German books!\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean that you want to read German!\' and Blanche stood still,\r\nand looked at her cousin in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what else is the use of learning it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I don\'t know.  Every one does.  If one went abroad or to court,\r\nyou know,\' said Blanche vaguely; but Ursula had now a fresh subject of\r\ninterest; for, on emerging from the shrubbery, they came in sight of a\r\npicturesque but not very architectural church, which had the smallest\r\nproportion of wall and the largest of roof, and a pretty oriel-windowed\r\nschoolhouse covered with clematis.  Nuttie rushed into inquiries about\r\nservices and schools, and was aghast at hearing of mere Sundays and\r\nsaints\' days.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no! father isn\'t a bit Ritualistic.  I wish he was, it would be so\r\nmuch prettier; and then he always advertises for curates of moderate\r\nviews, and they are so stupid.  You never saw such a stick as we have\r\ngot now, Mr. Edwards; and his wife isn\'t a lady, I\'m sure.\'\r\n\r\nThen as to schools, it was an absolute amazement to Nuttie to find that\r\nthe same plans were in force as had prevailed when her uncle had come\r\nto the living and built that pretty house--nay, were kept up at his\r\nsole expense, because he liked old-fashioned simplicity, and did not\r\nchoose to be worried with Government inspection.\r\n\r\n\'And,\' said Blanche, \'every one says our girls work ever so much\r\nbetter, and make nicer servants than those that are crammed with all\r\nsorts of nonsense not fit for them.\'\r\n\r\nAs to the Sunday school.  Mother and the curate take care of that. I\'m\r\nsure, if you like it, you can have my class, for I always have a\r\nheadache there, and very often I can\'t go.  Only May pegs away at it,\r\nand she won\'t let me have the boys, who are the only jolly ones,\r\nbecause she says I spoil them.  But you must be my friend--mind,\r\nNuttie, not May\'s, for we are nearer the same age.  When is your\r\nbirthday?  You must put it down in my book!\'\r\n\r\nNuttie, who had tolerable experience of making acquaintance with new\r\ngirls, was divided between a sense of Blanche\'s emptiness, and the\r\nwarmth excited by her friendliness, as well as of astonishment at all\r\nshe heard and saw.\r\n\r\nCrossing the straggling, meandering village street, the cousins entered\r\nthe grounds of the Rectory, an irregular but well-kept building of the\r\nsoft stone of the country, all the garden front of it a deep verandah\r\nthat was kept open in summer, but closed with glass frames in the\r\nwinter--flower-beds lying before it, and beyond a lawn where the young\r\nfolk were playing at the inevitable lawn-tennis.\r\n\r\nMargaret was not so pretty as Blanche, but had a more sensible face,\r\nand her welcome to Ursula was civil but reserved.  Rosalind and Adela\r\nwere bright little things, in quite a different style from their\r\nhalf-sisters, much lighter in complexion and promising to be handsomer\r\nwomen.  They looked full of eagerness and curiosity at the new cousin,\r\nwhom Blanche set down on a bank, and proceeded to instruct in the\r\nmysteries of the all-important game by comments and criticisms on the\r\nplayers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mark and Adela had come out conquerors, Ursula was called on\r\nto take her first lesson.  May resigned her racket, saying she had\r\nsomething to do, and walked off the field, and carrying off with her\r\nAdela, who, as Blanche said, \'had a spine,\' and was ordered to lie down\r\nfor an hour every afternoon.  The cheerfulness with which she went\r\nspoke well for the training of the family.\r\n\r\nNuttie was light-footed and dexterous handed, and accustomed to active\r\namusements, so that, under the tuition of her cousins, she became a\r\npromising pupil, and thawed rapidly, even towards Mark.\r\n\r\nShe was in the midst of her game when the two mothers came out, for the\r\ndrive had been extended all round the park, under pretext of showing it\r\nto its new mistress, but really to give the Canoness an opportunity of\r\njudging of her in a tete-a-tete.  Yet that sensible woman had asked no\r\nalarming questions on the past, still less had offered any advice that\r\ncould seem like interference.  She had only named localities, mentioned\r\nneighbours, and made little communications about the ways of the place\r\nsuch as might elicit remarks; and, as Alice\'s voice betrayed less and\r\nless constraint, she ventured on speaking of their daughters, so as to\r\ndraw forth some account of how Ursula might have been educated.\r\n\r\nAnd of this, Alice was ready and eager to talk, telling how clever and\r\nhow industrious Nuttie had always been, and how great an advantage Miss\r\nNugent\'s kindness was, and how she was hoping to go up for the\r\nCambridge examination; then, detecting some doubt in her companion\'s\r\nmanner, she said, \'It would be a great disappointment to her not to do\r\nso now.  Do you think she had better not?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think she will find time to go on with the preparation! And,\r\nto tell the truth, I don\'t think we are quite ripe for such things in\r\nthis county.  We are rather backward, and Ursula, coming in fresh upon\r\nus, might find it a disadvantage to be thought much cleverer than other\r\npeople.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  I was not quite sure whether her father would like it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do not think he would.  I am sure that if my little Rose were to\r\ntake it into her head, I should have hard work to get her father\'s\r\nconsent, though no doubt the world will have progressed by the time she\r\nis old enough.\'\r\n\r\n\'That settles it,\' said Alice.  \'Thank you, Mrs. Egremont.  I own,\' she\r\nadded presently, \'that I do somewhat regret that it cannot be, for I\r\nthought that a motive for keeping up her studies would be helpful to my\r\nchild;--I do not mean for the sake of the studies, but of the--the\r\nbalance in all this change and novelty.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are quite right, I have felt it myself,\' said her sister-in-law.\r\n\'Perhaps something could be done by essay societies.  May belongs to\r\none, and if Ursula is an intellectual girl, perhaps you could keep her\r\nup to some regular employment in the morning.  I succeeded in doing so\r\nwhen May came out, but I can accomplish nothing regular but music with\r\nBlanche; and an hour\'s steady practice a day is better than nothing.\'\r\n\r\nThe drive was on the whole a success, and so was the tea-drinking in\r\nthe verandah, where Aunt Alice and little five-years old Basil became\r\nfast friends and mutual admirers; the Canon strolled out and was\r\ninstalled in the big, cushioned basket-chair that crackled under his\r\nweight; Blanche recounted Nuttie\'s successes, and her own tennis\r\nengagements for the week; Mark lay on a rug and teased her, and her\r\ndachshund; Nuttie listened to the family chatter as if it were a play,\r\nand May dispensed the cups, and looked grave and severe.\r\n\r\n\'Well?\' said the Canon anxiously, when Mark, Blanche, and little Basil\r\nhad insisted on escorting the guests home, and he and his wife were for\r\na few minutes tete-a-tete.\r\n\r\n\'It might have been much worse,\' said the lady.  \'She is a good little\r\ninnocent thing, and has more good sense than I expected. Governessy,\r\nthat\'s all, but she will shake out of that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course she will.  It\'s the best thing imaginable for Alwyn!\'\r\n\r\nHis wife kept back the words, \'A hundred times too good for Alwyn!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLAWN-TENNIS.\r\n\r\n  \'Madam, the guests are come, supper served up,\r\n  My young lady asked for!\'--Romeo and Juliet.\r\n\r\n\r\nA garden-party, Mrs. William Egremont decided, would be the best mode\r\nof testifying her approbation of her sister-in-law, and introducing the\r\nnewcomers to the neighbourhood.  So the invitations were sent forth for\r\nan early day of the coming week.\r\n\r\nFrom how many points of view was Mrs. William Egremont\'s garden-party\r\nregarded, and how different!  There was Basil, to whom it meant wearing\r\nhis velvet suit and eating as many ices as mother would allow.  To\r\nBlanche, it was an occasion for triumph on the tennis ground for\r\nherself, and for hopes for her pupil; and Ursula herself looked forward\r\nto it and practised for it like a knight for his first encounter in the\r\nlists, her sole care being to distinguish herself with her racket.  To\r\nher mother, it was an ordeal, where she trusted not to be a\r\nmortification to her husband and his family; while to the hostess, it\r\nwas a not unwelcome occasion of exercising honest diplomacy and tact,\r\nnot without a sense of magnanimity.  To May, it was a bore to be\r\nendured with dutiful philosophy; to her good-natured father an occasion\r\nfor hospitality, where he trusted that his brother would appear, and\r\nappear to advantage, and was ready even to bribe him thereto with that\r\nwonderful claret that Alwyn had always envied, and declared to be\r\nwasted on a parson.  And Mark, perhaps he viewed the occasion with\r\ndifferent eyes from any one else.  At any rate, even the denizens of\r\nBridgefield mustered there with as many minds as Scott ascribes to the\r\ncombatants of Bannockburn, and there were probably as many other\r\ncircles of feeling more or less intersecting one another among the more\r\ndistant guests, most of them, however, with the same feeling of\r\ncuriosity as to what this newly-discovered wife and daughter of Alwyn\r\nEgremont might be like.\r\n\r\nExternally, in her rich black silk, trimmed with point lace, and her\r\nlittle straw-coloured bonnet with its tuft of feathery grass and blue\r\ncornflower, she was so charming that her daughter danced round her,\r\ncrying, \'O mammy, mammy, if they could but see you at home\'--then, at a\r\nlook: \'Well then--Aunt Ursel, and Miss Mary, and Mr. Dutton!\'\r\n\r\nNuttie was very much pleased with her own pretty tennis dress; but she\r\nhad no personal vanity for herself, only for her mother.  The knowledge\r\nthat she was no beauty was no grievance to her youthful spirits; but\r\nwhen her father surveyed them in the hall, she looked for his verdict\r\nfor her mother as if their relations were reversed.\r\n\r\n\'Ha!  Well, you certainly are a pretty creature, Edda,\' he said\r\ngraciously.  \'You\'ll pass muster!  You want nothing but style.  And,\r\nhang it! you\'ll do just as well without it, if the Canoness will only\r\ndo you justice.  Faces like that weren\'t given for nothing.\'\r\n\r\nShe blushed incarnadine and accepted one of his kisses with a pleasure,\r\nat which Nuttie wondered, her motherly affection prompting her to\r\nmurmur in his ear--\r\n\r\n\'And Ursula?\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'ll not cut you out; but she is Egremont enough to do very fairly.\r\nGoing already?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you would come with us,\' she said wistfully, to the horror of\r\nNuttie, who was burning to be at the beginning of all the matches.\r\n\r\n\'I? oh no!  I promised old Will to look in, but that won\'t be till late\r\nin the day, or I shall have to go handing all the dowagers into the\r\ndining-room to tea.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I think we had better go on.  They asked us to come early, so as\r\nto see people arrive and know who they are.\'\r\n\r\n_They_ was a useful pronoun to Alice, who felt it a liberty to call her\r\ngrand-looking sister-in-law, Jane--was too well-bred to term her Mrs.\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\nThe mother and daughter crossed the gardens, Nuttie chattering all the\r\nway about the tennis tactics she had picked up from Blanche, while her\r\nmother answered her somewhat mechanically, wondering, as her eye fell\r\non the square squat gray church tower, what had become of the earnest\r\ndevotion to church work and intellectual pursuits that used to\r\ncharacterise the girl.  True, always both mother and daughter had\r\nhitherto kept up their church-going, and even their Sunday-school\r\nhabits, nor had any hindrance come in their way, Mr. Egremont\r\napparently acquiescing in what he never shared.  But these things\r\nseemed, in Ursula\'s mind, to have sunk out of the proportion they held\r\nat Bridgefield, no longer to be the spirit of a life, but mere Sunday\r\nduties and occupations.\r\n\r\nWas this wicked world getting a hold of the poor child?  Which was\r\nduty? which was the world?  This was the thought that perplexed Alice,\r\ntoo simple as yet to perceive that Ursula\'s former absorption had been\r\nin the interests that surrounded her and her companions, exactly as\r\nthey were at present, and that the real being had yet to work itself\r\nout.\r\n\r\nFor herself, Alice did not think at all.  She was rejoicing in her\r\nrestored husband, and his evident affection.  Her duty towards him was\r\nin her eyes plain.  She saw, of course, that he had no religion, but\r\nshe accepted the fact like that of bad weather; she loved him, and she\r\nloved her daughter; she said her prayers with all her heart for them,\r\nshe hoped, and she did her best, without trying to go below the surface.\r\n\r\nThere was the Rectory gate wide open.  There was Basil rushing up to\r\ngreet his dear Aunt Alice, there were all the windows and doors of the\r\nRectory open, and the nearer slopes covered with chairs and seats of\r\nall dimensions, some under trees, some umbelliferous, and glowing\r\nAfghan rugs, or spotted skins spread for those who preferred the\r\nground.  There was Blanche flitting about wild with excitement, and\r\npouncing on Nuttie to admire her outfit, and reiterate instructions;\r\nthere were the two younger girls altering the position of chairs\r\naccording to their mother\'s directions; there were actually two\r\nguests--not very alarming ones, only the curate and his wife, both\r\nrather gaunt, bony people.  He was button-holing the Canon, and she was\r\ntrying to do the same by the Canoness about some parish casualty. The\r\nCanon hoped to escape in the welcome to his sister-in-law and niece,\r\nbut he was immediately secured again, while his wife found it requisite\r\nto hurry off else where, leaving Mrs. Edwards to tell her story to Mrs.\r\nEgremont.  In point of fact, Alice really liked the good lady, was\r\nquite at ease with her, and felt parish concerns a natural element, so\r\nthat she gave full heed and attention to the cruelty of Mrs. Parkins\'\r\ndepriving Betsy Butter (with an old father and mother to support) of\r\nher family washing, on the ground of a missing pocket handkerchief, the\r\nwhich Mrs. Edwards believed to have been abstracted by the favourite\r\npickle of Miss Blanche\'s class, if only a confession could be elicited\r\nfrom him when undefended by his furious mother.  Mrs. Egremont was\r\nlistening with actual interest and sympathy to the history of Betsy\r\nButter\'s struggles, and was inquiring the way to her cottage, when she\r\nwas called off to be introduced to the arrivals who were beginning to\r\nflood the lawn.  She presently saw May, who had just come down, walking\r\nup and down with Mrs. Edwards, evidently hearing the story of the\r\nhandkerchief.  She thought it had been Nuttie for a moment.  There was\r\na general resemblance between the cousins that made them be mistaken\r\nfor one another several times in the course of the day, since their\r\ndresses, though not alike, were of the same make and style.\r\n\r\nThus it was that as Nuttie was sitting on the grass in earnest\r\ncontemplation of Blanche\'s play, a hand was familiarly laid on her\r\nshoulder, and a voice said,  \'I haven\'t seen that horrid girl yet!\'\r\n\r\nAfter so many introductions, Nuttie had little idea whom she knew, or\r\nwhom she did not know.  She looked up and saw a small person in light\r\nblue, with the delicate features, transparent skin, and blue eyes that\r\naccompany yellow hair, with an indescribable glitter of mirth and\r\njoyousness about the whole creature, as if she were part and parcel of\r\nthe sunbeam in which she stood.\r\n\r\n\'What horrid girl?\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'The interloper, the newly-discovered savage, come to upset--Ah!\'--with\r\na little shriek--\'It isn\'t May!  I beg your pardon.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m May\'s cousin,\' said Nuttie, \'Ursula Egremont.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, oh!\' and therewith the fact burst on both girls at once.  They\r\nstood still a moment in dismay, then the stranger went into a fit of\r\nlaughter.  \'Oh, I beg your pardon!  I can\'t help it!  It is so funny!\'\r\n\r\nNuttie was almost infected, though somewhat hurt.  \'Who said I was\r\nhorrid?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'Nobody!  Nobody but me--Annaple Ruthven--and they\'ll all tell you, May\r\nand all, that I\'m always putting my foot in it.  And I never meant that\r\nyou were horrid--you yourself--you know--only--\'\r\n\r\n\'Only nobody wanted us here,\' said Nuttie; \'but we could not help it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course not.  It was shocking, just my way.  Please forgive me!\' and\r\nshe looked most pleading.  Nuttie held out her hand with something\r\nabout \'No one could mind;\' and therewith Annaple cried, \'Oh, if you\r\ndon\'t mind, we can have our laugh out!\' and the rippling laughter did\r\nset Nuttie off at once.  The peal was not over when May herself was\r\nupon them demanding what was the joke.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, there she is!  The real May!  Why,\' said Annaple, kissing her,\r\n\'only think here I\'ve been and gone and thought this was you, and\r\ninquired about--What was it?--the awful monster--the chimera dire--that\r\nMark had routed up--\'\r\n\r\n\'No; you didn\'t say that,\' said Nuttie, half provoked.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind what I said.  Don\'t repeat it.  I only wish myself and\r\nevery one else to forget it.  Now it is swept to the winds by a good\r\nwholesome giggling.  But what business have you two to be so\r\ninconveniently alike?  You are as bad as the twin Leslies!\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s an old foremother on the staircase in white satin who left her\r\nlooks to us both,\' said May.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll have to wear badges,\' said Annaple.  \'You know the Leslies were\r\nso troublesome that one had to be shipped off to the East Indies and\r\nthe other to the West.\'\r\n\r\n\'They married, that\'s all,\' said May, seeing Nuttie looking mystified;\r\nand at that moment, Blanche\'s side coming out victorious, Nuttie\r\ndescended into the arena to congratulate and be asked to form part of\r\nthe next set.\r\n\r\n\'Well, that was a scrape!\' said Annaple; \'but she wasn\'t bad about it!\r\nI must do something to make up for it somehow--get Janet to invite her,\r\nbut really Janet is in such a state of mind that I am mildness itself\r\ncompared with her.  She would not have come, only John was curious, and\r\ndeclared he should go whether we did or not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said May, \'I saw him, like the rest of mankind, at madame\'s feet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! is she of that sort?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said May, \'not at all.  Mother and father too both think she is\r\ngood to the backbone; but she is very pretty, with just the inane soft\r\nsweetness that men rave about--innocent really.  All accounts of her\r\nare excellent, and she has nice parish ways, and will be as helpful as\r\nUncle Alwyn will let her.\'\r\n\r\n\'But she couldn\'t always have been nice?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I verily believe it was all Uncle Alwyn\'s and grandmamma\'s\r\nfault.  I know Mark thinks so.\'\r\n\r\n\'When the women of a family acquit a woman it goes for something,\' said\r\nAnnaple.  \'That\'s not original, my dear, I heard old Lady Grosmede say\r\nso to Janet when she was deliberating over the invitation, "For a good\r\ndeal more than Mr. Mark\'s, at any rate.\'"\r\n\r\n\'Mark is very fond of her--the mother, I mean.  He says when he was a\r\nlittle fellow her loss was worse to him than even our mother\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you remember the catastrophe?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a bit.  Only when she is petting Basil it strikes me that I have\r\nheard the tones before.  I only remember the time of misery under the\r\ncrosspatches grandmamma got for us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it was a splendid cutting of his own throat in Mark,\' said\r\nAnnaple, \'so it ought to turn out well.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know how it is to turn out for Mark,\' answered May.  \'Oh, here\r\nhe comes!\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you come into this set, Annaple?\' he asked.  \'They want another\r\ncouple,\' and, as she accepted,  \'How do you get on with May\'s double?\'\r\n\r\n\'I pity May for having such a double.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t encourage her by misplaced pity.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s abominable altogether!  I want to fly at somebody!\'\r\n\r\n\'Exhaust your feelings on your racket, and reflect that you see a man\r\nreleased from bondage.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is that philosophy or high-faluting?\' she said in a teasing tone as\r\nthe game began.\r\n\r\nThe Ruthvens had very blue blood in their veins, but as there were nine\r\nof the present generation, they possessed little beyond their long\r\npedigree; even the head of the family, Lord Ronnisglen, being forced to\r\nlive as a soldier, leaving his castle to grouse shooters. His seven\r\nbrothers had fared mostly in distant lands as they could, and his\r\nmother had found a home, together with her youngest child, at Lescombe,\r\nwhere her eldest was the wife of Sir John Delmar.  Lady Ronnisglen was\r\nan invalid, confined to the house, and Lady Delmar had daughters fast\r\ntreading on the heels of Annabella, so christened, but always called\r\nAnnaple after the old Scottish queens, her ancestors. She had been May\r\nEgremont\'s chief friend ever since her importation at twelve years old,\r\nand the intimacy had been promoted by her mother and sister.  Indeed,\r\nthe neighbourhood had looked on with some amusement at the competition\r\nascribed to Lady Delmar and to the wealthy parvenu, Mrs. West, for the\r\nheir-presumptive of Bridgefield Egremont.\r\n\r\nAnnaple\'s lightness and dexterity rendered her the best of the lady\r\ntennis-players, and the less practised Ursula found herself defeated in\r\nthe match, in spite of a partner whose play was superior to Mark\'s, and\r\nwith whom she shyly walked off to eat ices.\r\n\r\n\'I see,\' said Annaple, \'it is a country-town edition of May.  I shan\'t\r\nblunder between them again.\'\r\n\r\n\'She will polish,\' said Mark, \'but she is not equal to her mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whom I have not seen yet.  Ah, there\'s Mr. Egremont!  Why, he looks\r\nquite renovated!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well he may be!\'\r\n\r\n\'But Mark, not to hurt your feelings, he must have behaved atrociously.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not going to deny it,\' said Mark.\r\n\r\n\'I always did think he looked like it,\' said Annaple.\r\n\r\n\'When have you seen him before?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only once, but it was my admirable sagacity, you understand?  I always\r\nsee all the villains in books just on his model.  Oh, but who\'s that?\r\nHow very pretty!  You don\'t mean it is she!  Well, she might be the\r\nheroine of anything!\'\r\n\r\n\'Isn\'t she lovely?\'\r\n\r\n\'And has she been keeping school like Patience on a monument all these\r\nyears?  It doesn\'t seem to have much damaged her damask cheek!\'\r\n\r\n\'It was only daily governessing.  She looks much better than when I\r\nfirst saw her; and as to the damask--why, that\'s deepened by the\r\nintroduction to old Lady Grosmede that is impending.\'\r\n\r\n\'She is being walked up to the old Spanish duck with the red rag round\r\nher leg to receive her fiat.  What a thing it is to be a bearded\r\nDowager, and rule one\'s neighbourhood!\'\r\n\r\n\'I think she approves.  She has made room for her by her side.  Is she\r\ngoing to catechise her?\'\r\n\r\nAnnaple made an absurd sound of mingled pity and disgust.\r\n\r\n\'Not that she--my aunt, I mean--need be afraid.  The shame is all on\r\nthe other side.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I think Lady Grosmede has too much sense to think the worse of her\r\nfor having worked for herself,\' added Annaple.  \'If it was not for\r\nmother I should long to begin!\'\r\n\r\n\'You?  It\'s a longing well known to me!--but you!\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly!  As the Irishman felt blue moulded for want of a bating, so\r\ndo I feel fagged out for want of an honest day\'s work.\'\r\n\r\n\'If one only knew what to turn to,\' said Mark so wearily that Annaple\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n\'We seem to be in the frozen-out state of mind, and might walk up and\r\ndown singing "I\'ve got no work to do,"\'--to which she gave the well\r\nknown intonation.\r\n\r\n\'Too true,\' said he, joining in the hum.\r\n\r\n\'But I thought you were by way of reading law.\'\r\n\r\n\'One must see more than only "by way of" in these days to do any good.\'\r\n\r\nAt that moment Basil ran up with a message that Lady Delmar was ready\r\nto go home.\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly up the terrace and Mark paused as they came near\r\nMrs. Egremont to say, \'Aunt Alice, here is Miss Ruthven, May\'s great\r\nfriend.\'\r\n\r\nAnnaple met a pleasant smile, and they shook hands, exchanging an\r\nobservation or two, while a little way off Lady Grosmede was nodding\r\nher strong old face at Lady Delmar, and saying, \'Tell your mother I\'ll\r\nsoon come and see her, my dear.  That\'s a nice little innocent body,\r\nlady-like, and thoroughly presentable.  Alwyn Egremont might have done\r\nworse.\'\r\n\r\n\'The only wonder is he did not!\' returned Lady Delmar.  \'They make the\r\nbest of it here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very good taste of them.  But, now I\'ve seen her, I don\'t believe\r\nthere\'s anything behind.  Very hard upon the poor young man, though it\r\nwas all his doing, his mother says.  I congratulate you that it had not\r\ngone any farther in that quarter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, dear no!  Never dreamt of it.  She is May\'s friend, that\'s all.\'\r\n\r\nNevertheless Lady Delmar made a second descent in person to hurry\r\nAnnaple away.\r\n\r\n\'Isn\'t it disgusting?\' said May, catching her stepmother\'s smile.\r\n\r\n\'You will see a good deal more of the same kind,\' said the Canoness; \'I\r\nam afraid more mortification is in store for Mark than he guesses. I\r\nwish that girl were more like her mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mamma! a girl brought up among umbrella-makers!  Just fancy!  Why, she\r\nhas just nothing in her!\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t set Mark against her, May; he might do worse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Her head is a mere tennis ball,\' said May, drawing her own higher than\r\never, \'and no one would know her from a shop girl.\'\r\n\r\n\'She is young enough,\' said the Canoness.  \'Don\'t class me with Lady\r\nDelmar, May--I only say--if--and that I don\'t think you realise the\r\nchange Mark will feel.\'\r\n\r\n\'Better so than sell himself,\' muttered May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nOUT OF WORK.\r\n\r\n  \'I\'m seeking the fruit that\'s nae growing.\'--Ballad.\r\n\r\n\r\nSociety recognised the newcomers.  Lady Grosmede\'s card appeared the\r\nnext day, and was followed by showers of others, and everybody asked\r\neverybody \'Have you seen Mrs. Egremont?\'\r\n\r\nIt was well for Alice\'s happiness even at home that she was a success.\r\nWhen Alwyn Egremont had been lashed by his nephew\'s indignant integrity\r\ninto tardy recognition of the wife of his youth, it had been as if he\r\nhad been forced to pick up a flower which he had thrown away.  He had\r\nconsiderable doubts whether it would answer. First, he reconnoitred,\r\nintending, if he found a homely or faded being, to pension her off; but\r\nthis had been prevented by her undeniable beauty and grace, bringing up\r\na rush of such tender associations as he was capable of.  Yet even\r\nthen, her position depended on the impression she might make on those\r\nabout him, on her own power of self-assertion, and on her contributing\r\nto his comfort or pleasure.\r\n\r\nOf self-assertion Alice had none, only a gentle dignity in her\r\nsimplicity, and she was so absolutely devoted to him that he found his\r\nhouse far more pleasant and agreeable for her presence and unfailing\r\nattention, though still his estimation of her was influenced more than\r\nhe owned to himself by that of the world in general, and the Rectory in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nAnd the Rectory did its part well.  The Canon was not only charmed with\r\nthe gentle lady, but felt an atonement due to her; and his wife,\r\nwithout ever breathing into any ears, save his, the mysterious\r\nadjective \'governessy,\' praised her right and left, confiding to all\r\ninquirers the romance of the burnt yacht, the lost bride, and the happy\r\nmeeting under Lady Kirkaldy\'s auspices, with the perfect respectability\r\nof the intermediate career, while such was the universal esteem for,\r\nand trust in herself and the Canon, that she was fully believed; and\r\npeople only whispered that probably Alwyn Egremont had been excused for\r\nthe desertion more than he deserved.\r\n\r\nThe subject of all this gossip troubled herself about it infinitely\r\nless than did the good Canoness.  In effect she did not know enough of\r\nthe world to think about it at all.  Her cares were of a different\r\norder, chiefly caused by tenderness of conscience, and solicitude to\r\nkeep the peace between the two beings whom she best loved.\r\n\r\nTwo things were in her favour in this latter respect, one that they saw\r\nvery little of each other, since Mr. Egremont seldom emerged from his\r\nown rooms till after luncheon; and the other that Ursula\'s brains ran\r\nto little but lawn-tennis for the ensuing weeks.  To hold a champion\'s\r\nplace at the tournaments, neck and neck with her cousin Blanche, and\r\ndefeat Miss Ruthven, and that veteran player, Miss Basset, was her\r\nforemost ambition, and the two cousins would have practised morning,\r\nnoon, and night if their mothers would have let them.  There need have\r\nbeen no fear of Ursula\'s rebellion about the Cambridge honours, she\r\nnever seemed even to think of them, and would have had no time in the\r\nmore important competition of rackets. Indeed, it was almost treated as\r\na hardship that the pair were forbidden to rush together before twelve\r\no\'clock, and that Ursula\'s mother insisted on rational home occupation\r\nuntil that time, setting the example herself by letter-writing,\r\nneedlework, and sharing in the music which was a penance to the girl,\r\nonly enforced by that strong sense of protecting affection which\r\nforbade rebellion.  But Alice could hope that their performances were\r\npleasant to her husband in the evening, if only to sleep by, and so she\r\npersisted in preparing for them.\r\n\r\nNuttie\'s rage for tennis, and apparent forgetfulness of her old life\r\nand aspirations, might be disappointing, but it conduced to make her\r\nmother\'s task easier than if she had been her original, critical, and\r\nprotesting self.  In the new and brilliant surroundings she troubled\r\nherself much less than could have been expected at the failure of her\r\nfather, his house, nay, and of the parish itself, in coming up to the\r\nSt. Ambrose standard.  How much was owing to mere novelty and\r\nintoxication, how much to a yet unanalysed disappointment, how much to\r\nMay\'s having thrown her upon the more frivolous Blanche, could not be\r\nguessed.  The effect was unsatisfactory to her mother, but a certain\r\nrelief, for Nuttie\'s aid would have been only mischievous in the\r\nhousehold difficulties that weighed on the anxious conscience. Good\r\nservants would not stay at Bridgefield Hall for unexplained causes,\r\nwhich their mistress believed to be connected with Gregorio, or with\r\nthe treasure of a cook-housekeeper over whom she was forbidden to\r\nexercise any authority, and who therefore entirely neglected all meals\r\nwhich the master did not share with the ladies. Fortunately, Mr.\r\nEgremont came in one day at their luncheon and found nothing there but\r\nsemi-raw beef, upon which there was an explosion; and being by this\r\ntime convinced that his wife both would and could minister to his\r\ncomfort, her dominion was established in the female department, though,\r\nas long as Gregorio continued paramount with his master, and the\r\nstables remained in their former state, it was impossible to bring\r\nmatters up to the decorous standard of the Rectory, and if ever his\r\nmistress gave an order he did not approve, Gregorio overruled it as her\r\nignorance.  In fact, he treated both the ladies with a contemptuous\r\nsort of civility.  Meantime Mr. Egremont was generally caressing and\r\nadmiring in his ways towards his wife, with only occasional bursts of\r\ntemper when anything annoyed him.  He was proud of her, gave her a\r\nliberal allowance, and only refused to be troubled; and she was really\r\nhappy in his affection, for which she felt a gratitude only too humble\r\nin the eyes of her daughter.\r\n\r\nThey had parties.  Blanche\'s ambition of tennis courts all over the\r\nlawn was fulfilled, and sundry dinners, which were crosses to Alice,\r\nwho had neither faculty nor training for a leader and hostess, suffered\r\nmuch from the menu, more from the pairing of her guests, more again in\r\ncatching her chief lady\'s eye after, and most of all from her husband\'s\r\nscowls and subsequent growls and their consequence, for Ursula broke\r\nout, \'It is not fair to blame my mother.  How should she have all the\r\nsavoir-faire, or what you may call it, of Aunt Jane, when she has had\r\nno practice?\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps, Mrs. Egremont,\' he retorted with extreme suavity, \'you will\r\nalso attend to your daughter\'s manners.\'  Otherwise he took little\r\nnotice of Ursula, viewing her perhaps, as did the neighbourhood, as a\r\npoor imitation of May, without her style, or it may be with a sense\r\nthat her tongue might become inconvenient if not repressed.  When he\r\nbegan to collect sporting guests of his own calibre in the shooting\r\nseason, the Canoness quietly advised her sister-in-law to regard them\r\nas gentlemen\'s parties, and send Ursula down to spend the evening with\r\nher cousins; and to this no objection was made.  Mr. Egremont wanted\r\nhis beautiful wife at the head of his table, and his guests never\r\ncomported themselves unsuitably before her; but nobody wanted the\r\nunformed girl, and she and Blanche were always happy together.\r\n\r\nThe chief restraint was when Mark was at home, and that was not always.\r\nHe made sundry visits and expeditions, and was altogether in an\r\nuncomfortable condition of reaction and perplexity as to his future.\r\nHe was a good and conscientious fellow, and had never been actually\r\nidle, but had taken education and life with the easiness of the\r\nprospective heir to a large property; and though he had acquitted\r\nhimself creditably, it was with no view of making his powers\r\nmarketable.  Though he had been entered at the Temple, it was chiefly\r\nin order to occupy himself respectably, and to have a nominal\r\nprofession, so as not to be wholly dependent on his uncle; and all that\r\nhe had acquired was the conviction that it would be half a lifetime, if\r\nnot a whole one, before the law would afford him a maintenance.\r\n\r\nHis father wished him to take Holy Orders with a view to the reversion\r\nof the Rectory, but Mark\'s estimate of clerical duty and vocation was\r\njust such as to make him shrink from them.  He was three-and-twenty, an\r\nawkward age for all those examinations that stand as lions in the face\r\nof youth intended for almost any sort of service, and seldom or never\r\nto be gagged by interest.  For one indeed, he went up and failed, and\r\nin such a manner as to convince him that cramming had more to do than\r\ngeneral culture with success.\r\n\r\nHe had a certain consciousness that most people thought another way\r\nopen to him, most decidedly his gentle aunt, and perhaps even his\r\nparents.  The matter came prominently before him one day at luncheon,\r\nwhen, some parochial affairs being on hand and Mr. Egremont out for the\r\nday, Alice, whose free forenoons enabled her to take a share in church\r\nand parish affairs, was there, as well as the curate and his wife.\r\n\r\nThese good people were in great commotion about a wedding about to take\r\nplace between a young farmer and his delicate first cousin, the only\r\nsurvivor of a consumptive family.\r\n\r\n\'"Proputty, proputty,"\' quoted the Canon.  \'James Johnson is what they\r\ncall a warm man.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is a sin and a shame,\' said Mrs. Edwards.  \'What can they expect?\r\nGeorge Johnson looks strong enough now, but they tell me his brother\r\nundoubtedly died of decline, though they called it inflammation; but\r\nthere was tubercular disease.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid it is strong in the family,\' said the Canoness, \'they all\r\nhave those clear complexions; but I do believe George is heartily in\r\nlove with poor little Emily.\'\r\n\r\n\'First cousins ought to be in the table of degrees,\' said Mr. Edwards.\r\n\r\n\'It is always a question whether the multiplying of prohibitions\r\nwithout absolute necessity is expedient,\' said the Canon.\r\n\r\nHe spoke quite dispassionately, but the excellent couple were not\r\nremarkable for tact.  Mrs. Edwards gave her husband such a glance of\r\nwarning and consternation as violently inclined May to laugh, and he\r\nobediently and hesitatingly began, \'Oh yes, sir, I beg your pardon. Of\r\ncourse there may be instances,\' thereby bringing an intense glow of\r\ncarnation into Alice\'s cheeks, while the Canon, ready for the occasion,\r\nreplied, \'And George Johnson considers himself one of them. He will\r\nrepair the old moat house, I suppose.\'\r\n\r\nAnd his wife, though she would rather have beaten Mrs. Edwards,\r\ndemanded how many blankets would be wanted that winter.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this little episode was that Mark announced to his father\r\nthat evening his strong desire to emigrate, an intention which the\r\nCanon combated with all his might.  He was apparently a hale and hearty\r\nman, but he had had one or two attacks of illness that made him doubt\r\nwhether he would be long-lived; and not only could he not bear to have\r\nhis eldest son out of reach, but he dreaded leaving his family to such\r\na head as his brother.  Mark scarcely thought the reasons valid,\r\nconsidering the rapidity of communication with Canada, but it was not\r\npossible to withstand the entreaties of a father with tears in his\r\neyes; and though he could not bring himself to consent to preparing to\r\nbe his father\'s curate, he promised to do nothing that would remove him\r\nto another quarter of the world, and in two or three days more, started\r\nfor Monks Horton to see what advice his uncle and aunt there could give\r\nhim; indeed, Lord Kirkaldy\'s influence was reckoned on by his family\r\nalmost as a sure card in the diplomatic line.\r\n\r\nThe Kirkaldys were very fond of Mark, and had an odd feeling of being\r\naccountable for the discovery which had changed his prospects.  They\r\nwould have done anything for him that they could, but all Lord\r\nKirkaldy\'s interest was at the foreign office, or with his\r\nfellow-diplomates, and here he soon found an insuperable bar.  Mark\'s\r\neducation had stood still from the time of Miss Headworth\'s flight till\r\nhis father\'s second marriage, his energies having been solely devoted\r\nto struggles with the grim varieties of governess purveyed by his\r\ngrandmother, and he had thus missed all chance of foundation of foreign\r\nlanguages, and when once at school, he had shared in the average\r\nEnglish boy\'s contempt and aversion for the French masters who\r\noutscreamed a whole class.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, Lord Kirkaldy, an accurate and elegant scholar in\r\nEuropean tongues, besides speaking them with the cosmopolitan ease of\r\nan ambassador\'s son, was horrified, not only at Mark\'s pronunciation,\r\nbut at his attempts at letter-writing and translation, made with all\r\nthe good will in the world, but fit for nothing but to furnish the good\r\nstories which the kind uncle refrained from telling any one but his\r\nwife.  Unluckily, too, a Piedmontese family, some of them not strong in\r\ntheir English, were on a visit at Monks Horton, and the dialect in\r\nwhich the old marquis and Mark tried at times to interchange ideas\r\nabout pheasants was something fearful.  And as in the course of a week\r\nMark showed no signs of improvement in vernacular French or Italian,\r\nLord Kirkaldy\'s conscience would let him give no other advice than that\r\nhis nephew should stick to English law living still on the allowance\r\nhis father gave him, and hoping for one of the chance appointments open\r\nto an English barrister of good family and fair ability.\r\n\r\nOf course Mark had gone at once to carry tidings of \'Aunt Alice,\' as he\r\nscrupulously called her, to old Miss Headworth, whom his aunt had\r\ncontinued to visit at intervals.  That good lady had given up her\r\nboarders, having realised enough to provide for her own old age, and\r\nshe had joined forces with the Nugents, Mary being very thankful to\r\nhave her companionship for Mrs. Nugent, who was growing too blind and\r\nfeeble to be satisfactorily left alone all day.\r\n\r\nMark delighted the old ladies by his visits and accounts of their\r\ndarling\'s success and popularity, which he could paint so brightly that\r\nthey could not help exulting, even though there might be secret\r\nmisgivings as to the endurance of these palmy days.  He was a great\r\nhero in their eyes, and they had too good taste to oppress him with\r\ntheir admiration, so that he really was more at ease in their little\r\ndrawing-room than anywhere at Monks Horton, whither the Italians could\r\npenetrate.  The marchesino spoke English very well, but that was all\r\nthe worse for Mark, since it gave such a sense of inferiority.  He was\r\nan intelligent man too, bent on being acquainted with English\r\nindustries of all kinds; and thus it was that a party was organised to\r\nsee the umbrella factory.  It was conducted by Mr. Dutton, with whom\r\nLord Kirkaldy, between charities and public business, had become\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nTo Mark\'s secret shame, this manufacturer spoke French perfectly, and\r\neven got into such a lively conversation with the old marquis about\r\nCavour, that Lord Kirkaldy begged him to come to dinner and continue\r\nit.  They were all surprised, not only by the details of the\r\nmanufacture and the multitude of artizans, male and female, whom it\r\nemployed, but by the number of warehouse-clerks whom they found at\r\nwork, and who, it appeared, were in correspondence with agencies and\r\ndepots in London and all the principal towns in the kingdom.  Gerard\r\nGodfrey was there,--casting looks askance at the young Egremont, whom\r\nhe regarded as a kind of robber.\r\n\r\nThe marchesino asked from what class these young men were taken, and\r\nMr. Dutton made reply that most of them were sons of professional men.\r\nIf they could obtain a small capital and take shares in the business\r\nthey were encouraged to do so, and rose to the headship of the\r\nagencies, obtaining a fair income.\r\n\r\n\'And you don\'t exact an examination,\' said Mark.\r\n\r\n\'Except in handwriting and book-keeping,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Poor Mark, you look for your bugbear everywhere!\' sighed his aunt.\r\n\r\nThey went over the Institute, coffee-rooms, eating-rooms, and\r\nlodging-houses, by which the umbrella firm strove to keep their hands\r\nrespectable and contented, and were highly pleased with all, most\r\nespecially with Mr. Dutton, who, though his name did not come\r\nprominently forward, had been the prime mover and contriver of all\r\nthese things, and might have been a wealthier man if he had not\r\nundertaken expenses which he could not charge upon the company.\r\n\r\nGerard Godfrey came in to Mrs. Nugent\'s that evening in the lowest\r\nspirits.  He had a sister married to a curate in the same county with\r\nBridgefield, and she had sent him a local paper which \'understood that\r\na marriage was arranged between Mark de Lyonnais Egremont, Esquire, and\r\nUrsula, daughter of Alwyn Piercefield Egremont, Esquire, of Bridgefield\r\nEgremont,\' and he could not help coming to display it to Miss Headworth\r\nin all its impertinence and prematurity.\r\n\r\n\'Indeed he said nothing to me about it,\' said Miss Headworth, \'and I\r\nthink he would if it had been true.\'\r\n\r\n\'No doubt he intends it, and is trying to recommend himself through\r\nyou,\' said Gerard.\r\n\r\n\'I should not think he needed that,\' returned Aunt Ursel, \'though I\r\nshould be very glad, I am sure.  He is an excellent young man, and it\r\nis quite the obvious thing.\'\r\n\r\n\'People don\'t always do the obvious thing,\' put in Mary Nugent.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly it didn\'t look like it,\' said Miss Headworth,\' when he told\r\nus about the great annual Hunt Ball at Redcastle that Nuttie and his\r\nsister Blanche are to come out at; he said he did not intend to go home\r\nfor it if he could help it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Struggling against fate,\' said Miss Nugent.\r\n\r\n\'The puppy!\' burst out Gerard.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the particulars of this same Hunt Ball, Gerard\r\nbecame possessed with a vehement desire to visit his sister, and so\r\nearnestly solicited a few days\' leave of absence that it was granted to\r\nhim.  \'Poor boy, he may settle down when he has ascertained what an ass\r\nhe is,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said Mary.  \'I thought he was very bad when I saw he had not\r\nchanged the green markers for St. Luke\'s Day.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nDETRIMENTALS.\r\n\r\n  \'That tongue of yours at times wags more than charity allows;\r\n   And if you\'re strong, be merciful, great woman of three cows.\'\r\n                                                     --J. O. MANGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNine miles was a severe distance through country lanes in November to\r\ngo to a ball; but the Redcastle Hunt Ball was the ball of the year,\r\nuniting all the county magnates; and young ladies were hardly reckoned\r\nas \'come out\' till they had appeared there.  Mrs. Egremont\'s position\r\nwould hardly be established till she had been presented to the\r\nnotabilities who lived beyond calling intercourse; and her husband\r\nprepared himself to be victimised with an amount of grumbling that was\r\nintended to impress her with the magnitude of the sacrifice, but which\r\nonly made her offer to forego the gaiety, and be told that she would\r\nnever have any common sense.\r\n\r\nSo their carriage led the way, and was followed by the Rectory\r\nwaggonette containing the ladies and Mark, who had been decisively\r\nsummoned home, since his stepmother disliked public balls without a\r\ngentleman in attendance, and his father was not to be detached from his\r\nfireside.\r\n\r\nAnd in a group near the door, got up as elaborately as his powers could\r\naccomplish, stood Gerard Godfrey.  He knew nobody there except a family\r\nin his sister\'s parish, who had good-naturedly given him a seat in\r\ntheir fly, and having fulfilled his duty by asking the daughter to\r\ndance, he had nothing to disturb him in watching for the cynosure whose\r\nattraction had led him into these unknown regions, and, as he\r\nremembered with a qualm, on the eve of St. Britius. However, with such\r\na purpose, one might surely grant oneself a dispensation from the vigil\r\nof a black letter saint.\r\n\r\nThere at length he beheld the entrance.  There was the ogre himself,\r\nhigh bred, almost handsome, as long as he was not too closely\r\nscrutinised, and on his arm the well-known figure, metamorphosed by\r\ndelicately-tinted satin sheen and pearls, and still more by the gentle\r\nblushing gladness on the fair cheeks and the soft eyes that used to\r\ndroop.  Then followed a stately form in mulberry moire and point lace,\r\nleaning on Gerard\'s more especial abhorrence,--\'that puppy,\' who had\r\nbeen the author of all the mischief; and behind them three girls, one\r\nin black, the other two in white, and, what was provoking, he really\r\ncould not decide which was Ursula.  The carefully-dressed hair and\r\nstylish evening dress and equipments had altogether transformed the\r\nlittle homely schoolgirl, so that, though he was sure that she was not\r\nthe fair-haired damsel with pale blue flowers, he did not know how to\r\ndecide between the white and daisies and the black and grasses.\r\nIndeed, he thought the two whites most likely to be sisters, and all\r\nthe more when the black lace halted to exchange greetings with some\r\none, and her face put on an expression so familiar to him, that he\r\nstarted forward and tried to catch her eye; but in vain, and he\r\nsuffered agonies of doubt whether she had been perverted by greatness.\r\n\r\nIt was some comfort that, when presently a rush of waiters floated by,\r\nshe was not with her cousin; but to provoke him still more, as the\r\ndaisies neared him, he beheld for a moment in the whirl the queer\r\nsmile, half-frightened, half-exultant, which he had seen on Nuttie\'s\r\nface when swinging sky-high!\r\n\r\nWhen the pause came and people walked about, the black lady stood\r\ntalking so near him that he ventured at last on a step forward and an\r\neager \'Miss Egremont,\' but, as she turned, he found himself obliged to\r\nsay, \'I beg your pardon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you mean my cousin.  We often get mistaken for each other,\' said\r\nMay civilly.\r\n\r\nHe brightened.  \'I beg your pardon,\' he said, \'I knew her at\r\nMicklethwayte.  I am here--quite by accident.  Mrs. Elmore was so good\r\nas to bring me.\'\r\n\r\nMay was rather entertained.  \'There\'s my cousin,\' she said, \'Lord\r\nPhilip Molyneux is asking her to dance,\' and she left him most\r\nunnecessarily infuriated with Lord Philip Molyneux.\r\n\r\nA steward introduced him to a dull-looking girl, but fortune favoured\r\nhim, for this time he did catch the real Nuttie\'s eye, and all herself,\r\nas soon as the dance was over, she came up with outstretched hands, \'Oh\r\nGerard! to think of your being here!  Come to mother!\'\r\n\r\nAnd, beautiful and radiant, Mrs. Egremont was greeting him, and there\r\nwere ten minutes of delicious exchange of news.  But \'pleasures are as\r\npoppies fled,\' Nuttie had no dance to spare, her card was full, and she\r\nhad not learnt fashionable effrontery enough to play tricks with\r\nengagements, and just then Mr. Egremont descended on them--\'I wish to\r\nintroduce you to the Duchess,\' he said to his wife; and on the way he\r\ndemanded--\'Who is that young cub?\'\r\n\r\n\'Gerard Godfrey--an old neighbour.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought I had seen him racketing about there with Ursula.  I\'ll not\r\nhave those umbrella fellows coming about!\'\r\n\r\n\'Does he really make umbrellas, Nuttie?\' asked Blanche, catching her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\'No such thing!\' said Nuttie hotly, \'he is in the office.  His father\r\nwas a surgeon; his sisters married clergymen!\'\r\n\r\n\'And he came here to meet you,\' said Annaple Ruthven.  \'Poor fellow,\r\nwhat a shame it is!  Can\'t you give him one turn!\r\n\r\n\'Oh dear!  I\'m engaged all through!  To Mark this time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Give him one of the extras!  Throw Mark over to me!  No,\' as she\r\nlooked at the faces of the two girls, \'I suppose that wouldn\'t do, but\r\nI\'m free this time--I\'m not the fashion.  Introduce me; I\'ll do my best\r\nas consolation.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie had just performed the feat, with great shyness, when Mark\r\nappeared, having been sent in quest of his cousin, when her father\r\nperceived that she had hung back.\r\n\r\nPoor Gerard led off Miss Ruthven the more gloomily, and could not help\r\nsighing out, \'I suppose that is an engagement!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! you believe that impertinent gossip in the paper,\' returned\r\nAnnaple.  \'I wonder they don\'t contradict it; but perhaps they treat it\r\nwith magnificent scorn.\'\r\n\r\n\'No doubt they know that it is only premature.\'\r\n\r\n\'If _they_ means the elders, I daresay they wish it, but we aren\'t in\r\nFrance or Italy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you don\'t think, Miss Ruthven, that it will come off?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see the slightest present prospect,\' said Annaple, unable to\r\nresist the kindly impulse of giving immediate pleasure, though she knew\r\nthe prospect might be even slighter for her partner.\r\n\r\nHowever, he \'footed it\' all the more lightly and joyously for the\r\nassurance, and the good-natured maiden afterwards made him conduct her\r\nto the tea-room, whither Mark and Nuttie were also tending, and there\r\nall four contrived to get mixed up together; and Nuttie had time to\r\nhear of Monsieur\'s new accomplishment of going home for Mr. Dutton\'s\r\nluncheon and bringing it in a basket to the office, before fate again\r\ndescended; Mr. Egremont, who had been at the far end of the room among\r\nsome congeners, who preferred stronger refreshment, suddenly heard her\r\nlaugh, stepped up, and, with a look of thunder towards her, observed in\r\na low voice, \'Mark, you will oblige me by taking your cousin back to\r\nher mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'The gray tyrant father,\' murmured Annaple in sympathy.  \'That being\r\nthe case, I may as well go back in that direction also.\'\r\n\r\nThis resulted in finding Lady Delmar and the two Mrs. Egremonts\r\ntogether, comparing notes about the two different roads to Redcastle\r\nfrom their several homes.\r\n\r\nLady Delmar was declaring that her coachman was the most obstinate man\r\nin existence, and that her husband believed in him to any extent.\r\n\r\n\'Which way did you come?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'By Bankside Lane,\' said the Canoness.\r\n\r\n\'Over Bluepost Bridge!  There, Janet,\' said Annaple.\r\n\r\n\'So much the worse.  I know we shall come to grief over Bluepost\r\nBridge, and now there will be treble weight to break it down.  I dreamt\r\nit, I tell you, and there\'s second sight in the family.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but you should tell what you did dream, Janet,\' said her sister.\r\n\'She thought Robinson, the coachman, was waltzing with her over it, and\r\nthey went into a hole and stuck fast, while the red-flag traction\r\nengineman prodded her with an umbrella till she was all over blood.\r\nNow, if it had been anything rational, I should have thought something\r\nof her second sight!  I tell her \'twas suggested by--\r\n\r\n         "London Bridge is broken down,\r\n          Dance o\'er my lady Lee!"\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Well, I am quite certain those traction-engines will break it some\r\ntime or other,\' said Lady Delmar.  \'I am always trying to get John to\r\nbring it before the magistrates, but he only laughs at me, and nothing\r\nwill induce Robinson to go the other way, because they have just been\r\nmending the road on Lescombe Hill!  Annaple, my dear, I can\'t allow you\r\nanother waltz; Mark must excuse you--I am going.  It is half-past two,\r\nand the carriage was ordered at two!  Robinson will be in a worse\r\ntemper than ever if we keep him waiting.\'\r\n\r\nShe bore her sister off to the cloak-room, and there, nearly an hour\r\nlater, the Egremonts found them still waiting the pleasure of the\r\nimplacable Robinson; but what was that in consideration of having kept\r\nher sister from such a detrimental as poor Mark had become?  So\r\nmuttered Mr. Egremont, in the satisfaction of having himself, with\r\ngentlemanly severity, intimated the insuperable gulf between Miss\r\nEgremont of Bridgefield and the Man of Umbrellas.\r\n\r\nMoreover, his sister-in-law took care that he should hear that the\r\nDuchess of Redcastle had pronounced his wife sweetly pretty and\r\nlady-like, and talked of inviting them for a visit of a few nights.\r\n\r\n\'A bore,\' observed he ungratefully, \'\'tis as dull as ditchwater.\' But,\r\nin truth, though the Canon\'s family, when in residence, were intimate\r\nwith the ducal family, Alwyn Egremont had never been at the castle\r\nsince the days of his earliest youth, and he was not quite prepared to\r\nowe his toleration there to his wife\'s charms, or the Canoness\'s\r\npatronage of her.\r\n\r\nAnd innocent Alice only knew that everybody had been very kind to her,\r\nand it was only a pity that her husband did not like her to notice poor\r\nGerard Godfrey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nGOING AGEE.\r\n\r\n  \'Gin ye were a brig as auld as me.\'--BURNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the matter?\' exclaimed Mrs. Egremont, waking from a\r\ndoze,--\'that bridge?\'\r\n\r\n\'Bridge!  Don\'t be such a fool!  We aren\'t near it yet.\'\r\n\r\nThe servant, his face looking blurred through the window, came to\r\nexplain that the delay was caused by an agricultural engine, which had\r\nchosen this unlucky night, or morning, to travel from one farm to\r\nanother.  There was a long delay, while the monster could be heard\r\ncoughing frightfully before it could be backed with its spiky companion\r\ninto a field so as to let the carriages pass by; and meantime Mr.\r\nEgremont was betrayed into uttering ejaculations which made poor Nuttie\r\nround her eyes in the dark as she sat by his feet on the back seat, and\r\nAlice try to bury her ears in her hood in the corner.\r\n\r\nOn they went at last, for about a mile, and then came another sudden\r\nstop--another fierce growl from Mr. Egremont, another apparition of the\r\nservant at the window, saying, in his alert deferential manner, \'Sir,\r\nthe bridge have broke under a carriage in front.  Lady Delmar\'s, sir.\r\nThe horse is plunging terrible.\'\r\n\r\nThe door was torn open, and all three, regardless of ball costumes,\r\nprecipitated themselves out.\r\n\r\nThe moon was up, and they saw the Rectory carriage safe on the road\r\nbefore them, but on the bridge beyond was a struggling mass, dimly\r\nilluminated by a single carriage lamp. Mr. Egremont and the groom\r\nhurried forward where Mark and the Rectory coachman were already\r\nrendering what help they could.  May standing at the horses\' heads, and\r\nher mother trying to wrap everybody up, since stay in their carriages\r\nthey could not.  Transferring the horses to Nuttie, the two sisters\r\nhurried on towards the scene of action, but Blanche\'s white satin boots\r\ndid not carry her far, and she turned on meeting her uncle.  He spoke\r\nwith a briskness and alacrity that made him like another man in this\r\nemergency, as he assured the anxious ladies that their friends were\r\nsafe, but that they could not be extricated till the carriage was\r\nlifted from the hole into which it had sunk amid bricks, stones, and\r\nbroken timbers.  He sent his own coachman to assist, as being the\r\nstronger man, and, mounting the box, turned and drove off in quest of\r\nfurther help, at a wayside cottage, or from the attendants on the\r\nengine, whose weight had probably done the mischief, and prepared the\r\ntrap for the next comer.\r\n\r\nAs May came near, her brother made her available by putting the lamp\r\ninto her hand, bidding her hold it so as to light those who were\r\nendeavouring to release the horse, which had cleared the portion of the\r\nbridge before the break-down under the brougham, and now lay on the\r\nroad, its struggles quelled by a servant at its head.  Nearly the whole\r\nof the hind wheels and most of the door had disappeared on one side,\r\nand, though more was visible on the other, it was impossible to open\r\nthe door, as a mass of rubbish lay on it.  Annaple was on this side,\r\nand her voice was heard calling to May in fits of the laughter which is\r\nperhaps near akin to screams--\r\n\r\n         \'"London bridge is broken down,\r\n           Dance o\'er my lady Lee!"\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet will go in for second-sight ever after.  Yes, she\'s all right,\r\nexcept a scratch from the glass, and that I\'m sitting on her more or\r\nless.  How are they getting on?\'  \'The horse is all but out.  Not hurt,\r\nthey think.  Here\'s another man come to help--a gentleman--my dear, it\r\nis your partner, Nuttie\'s umbrella man.\'  \'Oh, making it\r\ncomplete--hopes, Janet--I\'m sorry, but I can\'t help squashing you! I\r\ncan\'t help subsiding on you!  What is it now?\' as the lamp-light\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n\'They are looking for something to make levers of,\' returned May;\r\n\'these wooden rails are too rotten.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t they get us through the window?\' sighed a muffled voice.\r\n\r\n\'Not unless we could be elongated, like the Hope of the Katzekopfs.\'\r\n\r\n\'We shall manage now,\' cried Mark; \'we have found some iron bars to the\r\nhatch down there.  But you must prepare for a shock or two before you\r\ncan be set free.\'\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen and three servants strove and struggled, hoisted and\r\npushed, to the tune of suppressed sounds, half of sobs, half of\r\nlaughter, till at last the carriage was heaved up sufficiently to be\r\ndragged backwards beyond the hole; but even then it would not stand,\r\nfor the wheels on the undermost side were crushed, neither could either\r\ndoor be readily opened, one being smashed in, and the other jammed\r\nfast.  Annaple, however, still tried to keep up her own spirits and her\r\nsister\'s, observing that she now knew how to sympathise with Johnnie\'s\r\ntin soldiers in their box turned upside down.\r\n\r\nTwo sturdy labourers here made their appearance, having been roused in\r\nthe cottage and brought back by Mr. Egremont, and at last one door was\r\nforced open by main force, and the ladies emerged, Annaple, helping her\r\nsister, beginning some droll thanks, but pausing as she perceived that\r\nLady Delmar\'s dress was covered with blood.\r\n\r\n\'My dear Janet.  This is worse than I guessed.  Why did you not speak?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not much,\' said the poor lady, rather faintly.  \'My neck--\'\r\n\r\nThe elder ladies came about her, and seated her on cushions, where, by\r\nthe light of May\'s lamp, Alice, who had been to an ambulance class at\r\nMicklethwayte, detected the extent of the cut, extracted a fragment of\r\nglass, and staunched the bleeding with handkerchiefs and strips of the\r\ngirls\' tulle skirts, but she advised her patient to be driven at once\r\nto a surgeon to secure that no morsel of glass remained.  Mr. Egremont,\r\ngratified to see his wife come to the front, undertook to drive her\r\nback to Redcastle.  Indeed, they must return thither to cross by the\r\nhigher bridge.  \'You will go with me,\' entreated Lady Delmar, holding\r\nAlice\'s hand; and the one hastily consigning Nuttie to her aunt\'s care,\r\nthe other giving injunctions not to alarm her mother to Annaple, who\r\nhad declared her intention of walking home, the two ladies went off\r\nunder Mr. Egremont\'s escort.\r\n\r\nJust then it was discovered that the Delmar coachman, Robinson, had all\r\nthis time been lying insensible, not dead, for he moaned, but\r\napparently with a broken leg, if nothing worse.  Indeed, the men had\r\nknown it all along, but, until the ladies had been rescued, nothing had\r\nbeen possible but to put his cushion under his head and his rug over\r\nhim.  The ladies were much shocked, and Mrs. William Egremont decided\r\nthat he must be laid at the bottom of the waggonette, and that she\r\nwould take him straight to the hospital.\r\n\r\nThey were only a mile and a half from Lescombe, and it was pronounced\r\nsafe to cross on foot by the remains of the bridge, so that Annaple,\r\nwho had a pair of fur boots, had already decided on going home on foot.\r\nThe other girls wanted to accompany her, and, as May and Nuttie both\r\nhad overshoes, they were permitted to do so, and desired to go to bed,\r\nand wait to be picked up by the waggonette, which must return to\r\nBridgefield by the Lescombe road.  Blanche, having a delicate throat,\r\nwas sentenced to go with her stepmother.  Mark undertook to ride the\r\nhorse through the river, and escort the three girls, and Gerard Godfrey\r\nalso joined them.  The place where he was staying lay a couple of miles\r\nbeyond Lescombe, and when Mrs. Elmore\'s fly had been met and turned\r\nback by Mr. Egremont, he had jumped off to render assistance, and had\r\ndone so effectively enough to win Mark\'s gratitude.\r\n\r\nIt was by this time about half-past five, as was ascertained by the\r\nlight of the waning moon, the carriage-lamp having burnt out.  It was a\r\nfine frosty morning, and the moon was still powerful enough to reveal\r\nthe droll figures of the girls.  May had a fur cloak, with the hood\r\ntied over her head by Mrs. Egremont\'s lace shawl; Nuttie had a huge\r\nwhite cloud over her head, and a light blue opera cloak; Annaple had\r\n\'rowed herself in a plaidie\' like the Scotch girl she was, and her eyes\r\nflashed out merrily from its dark folds.  They all disdained the\r\ngentlemen\'s self-denying offers of their ulsters, and only Nuttie\r\nconsented to have the carriage-rug added to her trappings, and\r\ningeniously tied on cloak-fashion with her sash by Gerard.  He and Mark\r\npiloted the three ladies over the narrow border of the hole, which\r\nlooked a very black open gulf.  Annaple had thanked the men, and bidden\r\nthem come to Lescombe the next day to be paid for their assistance.\r\nThen they all stood to watch Mark ride through the river, at the\r\nshallowest place, indicated both by her and the labourers.  It was\r\nperfectly fordable, so Annaple\'s were mock heroics when she quoted--\r\n\r\n         \'Never heavier man and horse\r\n          Stemmed a midnight torrent\'s force.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Nuttie responded in a few seconds--\r\n\r\n         \'Yet through good heart and our Ladye\'s grace\r\n          Full soon he gained the landing place.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were both in high spirits, admiring each other\'s droll appearance,\r\nand speculating on the ghosts they might appear to any one who chanced\r\nto look out of window.  Annaple walked at the horse\'s head, calling him\r\npoor old Robin Hood, and caressing him, while Gerard and Nuttie kept\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nMay began to repent of her determination to walk; Lescombe seemed very\r\nfar off, and she had an instinct that she was an awkward fifth wheel.\r\nEither because Robin Hood walked too fast for her weary limbs, or\r\nbecause she felt it a greater duty to chaperon Nuttie than Annaple, she\r\nfell back on the couple in the rear, and was rather surprised at the\r\ntenor of their conversation.\r\n\r\nThis \'umbrella man\' was telling of his vicar\'s delight in the beautiful\r\nchalice veil that had been sent by Mrs. Egremont, and Nuttie was\r\ncommunicating, as a secret she ought not to tell, that mother was\r\nworking a set of stoles, and hoped to have the white ones ready by the\r\ndedication anniversary; also that there was a box being filled for the\r\nSt. Ambrose Christmas tree.  They were trying to get something nice for\r\neach of the choir boys and of the old women; and therewith, to May\'s\r\nsurprise, this youth, whom she regarded as a sort of shopman, fell into\r\nfull narration of all the events of a highly-worked parish,--all about\r\nthe choral festival, and the guilds, and the choir, and the temperance\r\nwork.  A great deal of it was a strange language to May, but she\r\nhalf-disapproved of it, as entirely unlike the \'soberness\' of\r\nBridgefield ways, and like the Redcastle vicar, whom her father\r\ncommonly called \'that madman.\'  Still, she had a practical soul for\r\nparish work, and could appreciate the earnestness that manifested\r\nitself, and the exertions made for people of the classes whom she had\r\nalways supposed too bad or else too well off to come under clerical\r\nsupervision.  And her aunt and cousin and this young man all evidently\r\nhad their hearts in it!  For Nuttie--though her new world had put the\r\nold one apparently aside--had plunged into all the old interests, and\r\nasked questions eagerly, and listened to their answers, as if\r\nMicklethwayte news was water to the thirsty. The two were too happy to\r\nmeet, and, it must be confessed, had not quite manners enough, to feel\r\nit needful to include in their conversation the weary figure that\r\nplodded along at a little distance from them, hardly attending to the\r\ndetails of their chatter, yet deriving new notions from it of the\r\nformer life of Ursula and her mother, matters which she had hitherto\r\nthought beneath her attention, except so far as to be thankful that\r\nthey had emerged from it so presentable.  That it was a more actively\r\nreligious, and perhaps a more intellectual one than her own, she had\r\nthought impossible, where everything must be second-rate.  And yet,\r\nwhen her attention had wandered from an account of Mr. Dutton\'s\r\ndealings with a refractory choir boy bent on going to the races, she\r\nfound a discussion going on about some past lectures upon astronomy,\r\nand Nuttie vehemently regretting the not attending two courses promised\r\nfor the coming winter upon electricity and on Italian art, and\r\nmournfully observing, \'We never go to anything sensible here.\'\r\n\r\nMay at first thought, \'Impertinent little thing,\' and felt affronted,\r\nbut then owned to herself that it was all too true.  Otherwise there\r\nwas hardly anything said about the contrast with Nuttie\'s present life;\r\nGerard knew already that the church atmosphere was very different, and\r\nwith the rector\'s daughter within earshot, he could not utter his\r\ncommiseration, nor Nuttie her regrets.\r\n\r\nOnce there was a general start, and the whole five came together at the\r\nsight of a spectrally black apparition, with a huge tufted head on\r\nhigh, bearing down over a low hedge upon them.  Nobody screamed except\r\nNuttie, but everybody started, though the next moment it was plain that\r\nthey were only chimney-sweepers on their way.\r\n\r\n\'Retribution for our desire to act ghosts!\' said Annaple, when the\r\nsable forms had been warned of the broken bridge.  \'Poor May, you are\r\nawfully tired!  Shouldn\'t you like a lift in their cart?\'\r\n\r\n\'Or I could put you up on Robin Hood,\' said Mark.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, I don\'t think I could stick on.  Is it much farther?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only up the hill and across the park,\' said Annaple, still cheerily.\r\n\r\n\'Take my arm, old woman,\' said Mark, and then there was a pause, before\r\nAnnaple said in an odd voice, \'You may tell her, Mark.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Annaple!  Mark! is it so?\' cried May joyously, but under her\r\nbreath; and with a glance to see how near the other couple were.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Annaple between crying and laughing.  \'Poor Janet, she\'ll\r\nthink we have taken a frightfully mean advantage of her, but I am sure\r\nI never dreamt of such a thing; and the queer thing is, that Mark says\r\nshe put it into his head!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' said Mark; \'you know better than that--\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, you told me you only found it out when she began to trample on\r\nthe fallen--\'\r\n\r\n\'I told you I had only understood my own heart.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I said very much the same--she made me so angry you see.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t but admire your motives!\' said May, exceedingly rejoiced all\r\nthe time, and ready to have embraced them both, if it had not been for\r\nthe spectators behind.  \'In fact, it was opposition you both wanted.  I\r\nwonder how long you would have gone on not finding it out, if all had\r\nbeen smooth?\'\r\n\r\n\'The worst of it is,\' said Annaple, \'that I\'m afraid it is a very bad\r\nthing for Mark.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not a bit of it,\' retorted he.  \'It is the only thing that could have\r\nput life into my work, or made me care to find any!  And find it I will\r\nnow!  Must we let the whole world in to know before I have found it,\r\nAnnaple?\'\r\n\r\n\'I could not but tell my mother,\' said Annaple.  \'It would come out in\r\nspite of me, even if I wished to keep it back.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes!  Lady Ronnisglen is a different thing,\' said Mark.  \'Just as\r\nMay here is--\'\r\n\r\n\'And she will say nothing, I know, till we are ready--my dear old\r\nminnie,\' said Annaple.  \'Only, Mark, do pray have something definite to\r\nhinder Janet with if there are any symptoms of hawking her commodity\r\nabout.\'\r\n\r\n\'I _will_,\' said Mark.  \'If we could only emigrate!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, if we could!\' said Annaple.  \'Ronald is doing so well in New\r\nZealand, but I don\'t think my mother could spare me.  She could not\r\ncome out, and she must be with me, wherever I am.  You know--don\'t\r\nyou--that I am seven years younger than Alick.  I was a regular\r\nsurprise, and the old nurse at Ronnisglen said \'Depend upon it, my\r\nLeddy, she is given to be the comfort of your old age.\'  And I have\r\nalways made up my mind never to leave her.  I don\'t think she would get\r\non with Janet or any of them without me, so you\'ll have to take her\r\ntoo, Mark.\'\r\n\r\n\'With all my heart,\' he answered.  \'And, indeed, I have promised my\r\nfather not to emigrate.  I must, and will, find work at hand, and wake\r\na home for you both!\'\r\n\r\n\'But you will tell papa at once?\' said May.  \'It will hurt him if you\r\ndo not.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are right, May; I knew it when Annaple spoke of her mother, but\r\nthere is no need that it should go further.\'\r\n\r\nThe intelligence had lightened the way a good deal, and they were at\r\nthe lodge gates by this time.  Gerard began rather ruefully to take\r\nleave; but Annaple, in large-hearted happiness and gratitude, begged\r\nhim to come and rest at the house, and wait for daylight, and this he\r\nwas only too glad to do, especially as May\'s secession had made the\r\nconversation a little more personal.\r\n\r\nNuttie was in a certain way realising for the first time what her\r\nmother\'s loyalty had checked her in expressing, even if the tumult of\r\nnovelties had given her full time to dwell on it.\r\n\r\n\'Everybody outside is kind,\' she said to Gerard; \'they are nice in a\r\nway, and good, but oh! they are centuries behind in church matters and\r\nfeeling, just like the old rector.\'\r\n\r\n\'I gathered that; I am very sorry for you.  Is there no one fit to be a\r\nguide?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know,\' said Nuttie.  \'I didn\'t think--I must, somehow, before\r\nLent.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is Advent close at hand,\' he said gravely.  \'If you could only\r\nbe at our mission services, we hope to get Father Smith!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if only I could!  But mother never likes to talk about those kind\r\nof things.  She says our duty is to my father.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not the foremost.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, she would not say that.  But oh, Gerard! if he should be making\r\nher worldly!\'\r\n\r\n\'It must be your work to hinder it,\' he said, looking at her\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Gerard! but I\'m afraid I\'m getting so myself.  I have thought a\r\ngreat deal about lawn-tennis, and dress, and this ball,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\'Somehow it has never quite felt real, but as if I were out on a visit.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are in it, but not of it,\' said Gerard admiringly.\r\n\r\n\'No, I\'m not so good as that!  I like it all--almost all.  I thought I\r\nliked it better till you came and brought a real true breath of\r\nMicklethwayte.  Oh! if I could only see Monsieur\'s dear curly head and\r\nbright eyes!\'\r\n\r\nThis had been the tenor of the talk, and these were the actual last\r\nwords before the whole five--just in the first streaks of\r\ndawn--coalesced before the front door, to be admitted by a sleepy\r\nservant; Mark tied up the horse for a moment, while Annaple sent the\r\nman to waken Sir John Delmar, and say there had been a slight accident,\r\nbut no one was much hurt; and, as they all entered the warm,\r\ndimly-lighted hall, they were keenly sensible that they had been\r\ndancing or walking all night.\r\n\r\nRest in the chairs which stood round the big hearth and smouldering\r\nwood-fire was so extremely comfortable, as they all dropped down, that\r\nnobody moved or spoke, or knew how long it was before there was a voice\r\non the stairs--\'Eh? what\'s this, Annaple?  An accident? Where\'s Janet?\'\r\nand a tall burly figure, candle in hand, in a dressing-gown and\r\nslippers, was added to the group.\r\n\r\n\'Janet will be at home presently, I hope,\' said Annaple, \'but she got a\r\ncut with some broken glass, and we sent her round by Dr. Raymond\'s to\r\nget it set to rights.  Oh, John! we came to grief on Bluepost Bridge\r\nafter all, and I\'m afraid Robinson has got his leg broken!\'\r\n\r\nSir John was a good-natured heavy man, whose clever wife thought for\r\nhim in all that did not regard horses, dogs, and game.  He looked\r\nperfectly astounded, and required to have all told him over again\r\nbefore he could fully take it in.  Then he uttered a suppressed\r\nmalediction on engines, insisted that all his impromptu guests should\r\nimmediately eat, drink, and sleep, and declared his intention of going\r\noff at once to Redcastle to see about his wife.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen were committed to the charge of the butler, and\r\nAnnaple took Nuttie and May to her sister\'s dressing-room, where she\r\nknew she should find fire and tea, and though they protested that it\r\nwas not worth while, she made them undress and lie down in a room\r\nprepared for them in the meantime.  It was a state chamber, with a big\r\nbed, far away from the entrance, shuttered and curtained up, and with\r\ndouble doors, excluding all noise.  The two cousins lay down, Nuttie\r\ndead asleep almost before her head touched the pillow, while May was\r\naching all over, declaring herself far too much tired and excited to\r\nsleep; and, besides that it was not worth while, for she should be\r\ncalled for in a very short time.  And she remained conscious of a great\r\ndread of being roused, so that when she heard her cousin moving about\r\nthe room, she insisted that they had scarcely lain down, whereupon\r\nNuttie laughed, declared that she had heard a great clock strike twelve\r\nbefore she moved, and showed daylight coming in through the shutters.\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t lie here any longer, I suppose,\' said May, sitting up\r\nwearily; \'and yet what can we put on?  It makes one shiver to think of\r\ngoing down to luncheon in a ball dress!\'\r\n\r\n\'Besides, mine is all torn to pieces to make bandages,\' said Nuttie. \'I\r\nmust put on the underskirt and my cloak again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or Annaple might lend us something.  I must get out somehow to know\r\nhow poor Lady Delmar is, and what has become of everybody.  Ring,\r\nUrsula, please, and lie down till somebody comes.\'\r\n\r\nThe bell was answered by a maid, who told them that my lady had been\r\nbrought home by Mr. and Mrs. Egremont about an hour after their\r\narrival.  She was as well as could be expected, and there was no cause\r\nfor anxiety.  Mr. and Mrs. Egremont had then gone on to Bridgefield,\r\nleaving word that Mrs. William Egremont and Miss Blanche were sleeping\r\nat Redcastle, having sent home for their own dresses and the young\r\nladies\', and would call for the rest of their party on the way.\r\nIndeed, a box for the Miss Egremonts had been deposited by the Canon\r\nfrom the pony-carriage an hour ago, and was already in the\r\ndressing-room; but Miss Ruthven would not have them disturbed.  Miss\r\nRuthven,--oh yes, she was up, she had not been in bed at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nA CASTLE OF UMBRELLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, Annaple Ruthven could not have slept, even if she had had time. Her\r\nfirst care had been to receive her sister, who had been met at the\r\nentrance of Redcastle by her husband.  There had been profuse offers of\r\nhospitality to Mr. and Mrs. Egremont, the latter of whom looked tired\r\nout, and offers of sending messengers to Bridgefield; but Mr. Egremont\r\nwould not hear of them, and every one suspected that he would not incur\r\nthe chance of rising without Gregorio and all his appliances.\r\n\r\nBy the time they were disposed of, and Lady Delmar safe in bed, it was\r\ntime to repair to her mother\'s room, so as to prevent her from being\r\nalarmed.  Lady Ronnisglen was English born.  She was not by any means\r\nthe typical dowager.  Her invalid condition was chiefly owing to an\r\naccident, which had rendered her almost incapable of walking, and she\r\nwas also extremely susceptible of cold, and therefore hardly ever went\r\nout; but there was so much youth and life about her at sixty-three that\r\nshe and Annaple often seemed like companion sisters, and her shrewd,\r\nkeen, managing eldest-born like their mother.\r\n\r\nAnnaple lay down beside her on her bed in the morning twilight, and\r\ngave her the history of the accident in playful terms indeed. Annaple\r\ncould never help that, but there was something in her voice that made\r\nLady Ronnisglen say, when satisfied about Janet\'s hurt, \'You\'ve more to\r\nsay, Nannie dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, minnie mine, I walked home with Mark Egremont.\'\r\n\r\n\'And--?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, minnie.  He is going to work and make a home--a real, true,\r\nhomely home for you and me.\'\r\n\r\n\'My child, my child, you have not hung the old woman about the poor\r\nboy\'s neck!\'\r\n\r\n\'As if I would have had him if he did not love her, and make a mother\r\nof her!\'\r\n\r\n\'But what is he going to do, Nan?  This is a very different thing\r\nfrom--\'\r\n\r\n\'Very different from Janet\'s notions!\' and they both laughed, the\r\nmother adding to the mirth by saying--\r\n\r\n\'Poor Janet, congratulating herself that no harm had been done, and\r\nthat you had never taken to one another!\'\r\n\r\n\'Did she really now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, only yesterday, and I bade her not crow too soon, for I\r\nthought I saw symptoms--\'\r\n\r\n\'You dear darling minnie!  Think of that!  Before we either of us knew\r\nit, and when he is worth ever so much than he was before!  Not but that\r\nI am enraged when people say he has acted nobly, just as if there had\r\nbeen anything else for him to do!\'\r\n\r\n\'I own that I am glad he has proved himself.  I was afraid he would be\r\ndragged in the way of his uncle.  Don\'t be furious, Nannie.  Not at all\r\ninto evil, but into loitering; and I should like to know what are his\r\nprospects now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, mother, I don\'t think he has any.  But he means to have.  And\r\nnot a word is to be said to anybody except you and his father and May\r\ntill he has looked over the top of the wall, and seen his way.  We need\r\nnot bring Janet down on us till then.\'\r\n\r\n\'I must see him, my dear.  Let me see him before he goes away.  He\r\nalways has been a very dear lad, a thoroughly excellent right-minded\r\nfellow.  Only I must know what he means to do, and whether there is any\r\nreasonable chance of employment or fixed purpose.\'\r\n\r\nLady Ronnisglen\'s maid here arrived with her matutinal cup of tea; and\r\nAnnaple, beginning to perceive that she was very stiff, went off in\r\nhopes that her morning toilette would deceive her hardworked little\r\nframe into believing it had had a proper night\'s rest.\r\n\r\nShe was quite ready to appear at the breakfast table, though her eldest\r\nniece, a long-haired, long-limbed girl, considerably the bigger of the\r\ntwo, was only too happy to preside over the cups.  All the four young\r\npeople were in the greatest state of excitement, welcoming, as the\r\nheroes of the night, Mark and Mr. Godfrey, and clamouring to be allowed\r\nto walk down after breakfast with their father and the gentlemen to see\r\nthe scene of the catastrophe and the remains of the carriage and the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nSir John made a courteous reference to the governess, but there was a\r\ngeneral sense that the cat was away, and presently there was a rush\r\nupstairs to prepare for the walk.  Annaple had time in the course of\r\nall the bustle, while the colour came back to her cheeks for a moment,\r\nto tell Mark that her mother had been all that was good, and wanted to\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\nHe must manage to stay till after eleven o\'clock; she could not be\r\nready before.  Then he might come to her sitting-room, which, as well\r\nas her bedroom, was on the ground floor.\r\n\r\nMark had to work off his anxiety by an inspection of the scene of the\r\ndisaster and a circumstantial explanation of the details to the young\r\nDelmars, who crowded round him and Mr. Godfrey, half awed, half\r\ndelighted, and indeed the youngest--a considerable tomboy--had nearly\r\ngiven the latter the opportunity of becoming a double hero by tumbling\r\nthrough the broken rail, but he caught her in time, and she only\r\nincurred from Sir John such a scolding as a great fright will produce\r\nfrom the easiest of fathers.\r\n\r\nAfterwards Mark put Gerard on the way to his brother-in-law\'s living,\r\nasking him on the road so many questions about the umbrella business\r\nthat the youth was not quite sure how to take it, and doubted whether\r\nthe young swell supposed that he could talk of nothing else; but his\r\npetulance was mitigated when he was asked, \'Supposing a person wished\r\nto enter the business, to whom should he apply?\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you know any one who wishes for anything of the kind?\' he asked.\r\n\'Are you making inquiries for any one?\' and on a hesitating\r\naffirmation, \'Because I know there is an opening for a man with capital\r\njust at present.  Dutton won\'t advertise--\'tis so risky; and he wants\r\nsome knowledge of a person\'s antecedents, and whether he is likely to\r\ngo into it in a liberal, gentlemanly spirit, with good principles, you\r\nsee, such as would not upset all we are doing for the hands.\'\r\n\r\n\'What amount of capital do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, from five hundred to a thousand!  Or more would not come amiss. If\r\nI only had it!  What it would be to conduct an affair like that on true\r\nprinciples!  But luck is against me every way.\'\r\n\r\nMark was at the sitting-room door as the four quarters began to strike\r\nin preparation for eleven, but Lady Ronnisglen had been in her chair\r\nfor nearly half-an-hour, having been rapid and nervous enough to hurry\r\neven the imperturbable maid, whom Annaple thought incapable of being\r\nhastened.  She was a little slight woman, with delicate features and\r\npale complexion, such as time deals with gently, and her once yellow\r\nhair now softened with silver was turned back in bands beneath the\r\nsimple net cap that suited her so well.  There was a soft yet sparkling\r\nlook about her as she held out her hands and exclaimed, \'Ah, Master\r\nMark, what mischief have you been doing?\'\r\n\r\nMark came and knelt on one knee beside her and said: \'Will you let me\r\nwork for you both, Lady Ronnisglen?  I will do my best to find some.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! that is the point, my dear boy.  I should have asked and wished\r\nfor definite work, if you had come to me before that discovery of\r\nyours; and now it is a mere matter of necessity.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Mark; then, with some hesitation, he added: \'Lady\r\nRonnisglen, do you care whether I take to what people call a\r\ngentleman\'s profession?  I could, of course, go on till I am called to\r\nthe bar, and then wait for something to turn up; but that would be\r\nwaiting indeed!  Then in other directions I\'ve taken things easy, you\r\nsee, till I\'m too old for examinations.  I failed in the only one that\r\nwas still open to me.  Lord Kirkaldy tried me for foreign office work,\r\nand was appalled at my blunders.  I\'m not fit for a parson.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought you were.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not I,\' said Mark.  \'I\'m not up to the mark there.  I couldn\'t say\r\nhonestly that I was called to it.  I wish I could, for it would be the\r\neasiest way out of it; but I looked at the service, and I can\'t.\r\nThere--that\'s a nice confession to come to you with!  I can\'t think how\r\nI can have been so impudent.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mark, you are a dear good lad.  I respect and honour you ever so much\r\nmore than before all this showed what stuff was in you!  But the\r\nquestion is, What\'s to be done?  My child is verily the "penniless lass\r\nwith a high pedigree," for she has not a poor thousand to call her own.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I have no right to anything in my father\'s lifetime, though I have\r\nno doubt he would give me up my share of my mother\'s portion--about\r\n\xa33000.  Now this is what has occurred to me: In the place where I found\r\nmy uncle\'s wife--Micklethwayte, close to Monks Horton--there\'s a great\r\numbrella factory, with agencies everywhere.  There are superior people\r\nbelonging to it.  I\'ve seen some of them, and I\'ve been talking to the\r\nyoung fellow who helped us last night, who is in the office.  I find\r\nthat to go into the thing with such capital as I might hope for, would\r\nbring in a much larger and speedier return than I could hope for any\r\nother way, if only my belongings would set aside their feelings.  And\r\nyou see there are the Kirkaldys close by to secure her good society.\'\r\n\r\nLady Ronnisglen put out her transparent-looking, black-mittened hand,\r\nand gave a little dainty pat to his arm.  \'I like to see a man in\r\nearnest,\' said she.  Her little Skye terrier was seized with jealousy\r\nat her gesture, and came nuzzling in between with his black nose. \'Mull\r\nobjects!\' she said, smiling; but then, with a graver look, \'And so will\r\nyour father.\'\r\n\r\n\'At first,\' said Mark; \'but I think he will give way when he has had\r\ntime to look at the matter, and sees how good you are.  That will make\r\nall the difference.\'\r\n\r\nSo Annaple, who had been banished for a little while, was allowed to\r\nreturn, and mother, daughter, and lover built themselves a little\r\ncastle of umbrellas, and bestowed a little arch commiseration on poor\r\nLady Delmar; who, it was agreed, need know nothing until something\r\ndefinite was arranged, since Annaple was clearly accountable to no one\r\nexcept her mother.  She would certainly think the latter part of her\r\ndream only too well realised, and consider that an unfair advantage had\r\nbeen taken of her seclusion in her own room.  In spite of all loyal\r\nefforts to the contrary, Mark, if he had been in a frame of mind to\r\ndraw conclusions, would have perceived that the prospect of escaping\r\nfrom the beneficent rule of Lescombe was by no means unpleasant to Lady\r\nRonnisglen.  The books that lay within her reach would hardly have\r\nfound a welcome anywhere else in the house.  Sir John was not\r\nbrilliant, and his wife had turned her native wits to the practical\r\nrather than the intellectual line, and had quite enough to think of in\r\nkeeping up the dignities of Lescombe with a large family amid\r\nagricultural difficulties.\r\n\r\nAnnaple remembered at last that she ought to go and look after her\r\nguests, assisted therein by the pleasure of giving May a hearty kiss\r\nand light squeeze, with a murmur that \'all was right.\'\r\n\r\nShe brought them downstairs just as the gong was sounding, and the rush\r\nof girls descending from the schoolroom, and Lady Ronnisglen being\r\nwheeled across the hall in her chair.  Nuttie, who had expected to see\r\na gray, passive, silent old lady like Mrs. Nugent, was quite amazed at\r\nthe bright, lively face and voice that greeted the son-in-law and\r\ngrandchildren, May and herself, congratulating these two on having been\r\nso well employed all the morning, and observing that she was afraid her\r\nNannie could not give so good an account of herself.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Sir John, \'I am sure she looks as if she found plodding\r\nalong the lanes as wholesome as sleeping in her bed!  Nan Apple-cheeks,\r\neh?\'\r\n\r\nWhereupon Annaple\'s cheeks glowed all the more into resemblance of the\r\nbaby-name which she had long ceased to deserve; but May could see the\r\ndarkness under her eyes, betraying that it was only excitement that\r\ndrove away fatigue.\r\n\r\nSir John had not gone far in his circumstantial description of the\r\ninjuries to his unfortunate carriage when the Canon arrived, with his\r\nwife and Blanche.  Mark would have given worlds in his impatience to\r\nhave matters settled between the two parents then and there; but Lady\r\nRonnisglen had already warned him that this would not be possible, and\r\nassured him that it would be much wiser to prepare his father\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\nThen he fixed his hopes on a solitary drive with his father back in the\r\npony carriage, but he found himself told off to take that home, and had\r\nto content himself with May as a companion.  Nor was his sister\'s mode\r\nof receiving the umbrella plan reassuring.  She had smiled too often\r\nwith her stepmother over Nuttie\'s having been brought up among\r\numbrellas to be ready to accept the same lot for her brother and her\r\nfriend, and she was quite sure that her father would never consent.\r\n\'An Egremont an umbrella-maker! how horrible!  Just fancy seeing\r\nDutton, Egremont and Co. on the handle of one\'s umbrella!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you need not patronise us,\' said Mark.\r\n\r\n\'But is it possible that Lady Ronnisglen did not object?\' said May.\r\n\r\n\'She seemed to think it preferable to driving pigs in the Texas, like\r\nher son Malcolm.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but then that _was_ the Texas.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh May, May, I did not think you were such a goose!\'\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought the folly was in not being patient.  Stick to\r\nyour profession, and something must come in time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, and how many men do you think are sticking to it in that hope? No,\r\nMay, \'tis not real patience to wear out the best years of my life and\r\nhers in idleness, waiting for something not beneath an Egremont to do!\'\r\n\r\n\'But is there nothing to do better than that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Find it for me, May.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nINFRA DIG.\r\n\r\n  \'Till every penny which she told,\r\n  Creative Fancy turned to gold.\'--B. LLOYD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blueposts Bridge had produced a good deal of effect.  Ursula\r\nEgremont in special seemed to herself to have been awakened from a\r\nstrange dream, and to have resumed her real nature and affections. She\r\nfelt as if she would give all her partners at the ball for one shake of\r\nMonsieur\'s fringed paws; her heart yearned after Aunt Ursel and Miss\r\nMary; she longed after the chants of the choir; and when she thought of\r\nthe effort poor Gerard Godfrey had made to see her, she felt him a\r\nhero, and herself a recreant heroine, who had well-nigh been betrayed\r\ninto frivolity and desertion of him, and she registered secret\r\nresolutions of constancy.\r\n\r\nShe burned to pour out to her mother all the Micklethwayte tidings, and\r\nall her longings to be there; but when the Rectory party set her down\r\nat the door, the footman, with a look of grave importance, announced\r\nthat Mr. Egremont was very unwell.  \'Mr. Gregory thinks he has taken a\r\nchill from the effect of exposure, sir, and Dr. Hamilton has been sent\r\nfor.\'\r\n\r\nThe Canon and his wife both got out on this intelligence, and Mrs.\r\nEgremont was summoned to see them.  She came, looking more frightened\r\nthan they thought the occasion demanded, for she was appalled by the\r\nsevere pain in the head and eyes; but they comforted her by assuring\r\nher that her husband had suffered in the same manner in the spring, and\r\nshe saw how well he had recovered; and then telling Nuttie to bring\r\nword what the doctor\'s report was, and then spend the evening at the\r\nRectory, they departed, while poor Nuttie only had one kiss, one\r\ninquiry whether she were rested, before her mother fled back to the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nNor did she see her again till after the doctor\'s visit, and then it\r\nwas only to desire her to tell her uncle that the attack was pronounced\r\nto be a return of the illness of last spring, and that it would be\r\nexpedient to go abroad for the winter.\r\n\r\nGo abroad!  It had always been a vision of delight to Nuttie, and she\r\ncould not be greatly concerned at the occasion of it; but she did not\r\nfind the Rectory in a condition to converse and sympathise.  Blanche\r\nwas lying down with a bad headache.  The Edwardses and a whole party of\r\nsemi-genteel parish visitors had come in to inquire about the accident,\r\nand had to be entertained with afternoon tea; and May, though helping\r\nher stepmother to do her devoir towards them, seemed more preoccupied\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nAs indeed she was, for she knew that Mark was putting his fate to the\r\ntouch with his father in the study.\r\n\r\nThe Canon heard the proposal with utter consternation and dismay at the\r\nperverseness of the two young people, who might have been engaged any\r\ntime these two years with the full approbation of their families, and\r\nnow chose the very moment when every one was rejoicing at their freedom.\r\n\r\n\'When a young man has got into a pickle,\' he said, \'the first thing is\r\nto want to be married!\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly so, sir, to give him a motive for getting out of the pickle.\'\r\n\r\n\'Umbrellas!  I should like to hear what your grandfather would have\r\nsaid!\'\r\n\r\n\'These are not my grandfather\'s days, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'No indeed!  There was nothing to do but to give a hint to old Lord de\r\nLyonnais, and he could get you put into any berth you chose. Interest\r\nwas interest in those days!  I don\'t see why Kirkaldy can\'t do the\r\nsame.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not unless I had foreign languages at my tongue\'s end.\'\r\n\r\nWhereat the Canon groaned, and Mark had to work again through all the\r\ndifficulties in the way of the more liberal professions; and the upshot\r\nwas that his father agreed to drive over to Lescombe the next day and\r\nsee Lady Ronnisglen.  He certainly had always implicitly trusted his\r\nson\'s veracity, but he evidently thought that there must have been much\r\nwarping of the imagination to make the young man believe the old\r\nScottish peeress to have consented to her daughter\'s marrying into an\r\numbrella factory.\r\n\r\nNuttie was surprised and gratified that both Mark and May put her\r\nthrough an examination on the habits of Micklethwayte and the position\r\nof Mr. Godfrey, which she thought was entirely due to the favourable\r\nimpression Gerard had produced, and she felt proportionably proud of\r\nhim when Mark pronounced him a very nice gentlemanly young fellow.  She\r\ncould not think why her uncle, with more testiness than she had ever\r\nseen in that good-natured dignitary, ordered May not to stand\r\nchattering there, but to give them some music.\r\n\r\nThe Canon drove to Lescombe the next day under pretext of inquiring\r\nafter Lady Delmar, and then almost forgot to do so, after he had\r\nascertained that she was a prisoner to her dressing-room, and that Sir\r\nJohn was out shooting.  The result of his interview filled him with\r\nastonishment.  Lady Ronnisglen having had a large proportion of sons to\r\nput out in life on very small means had learnt not to be fastidious,\r\nand held that the gentleman might ennoble the vocation instead of the\r\nvocation debasing the gentleman.  Moreover, in her secret soul she felt\r\nthat her daughter Janet\'s manoeuvres were far more truly degrading than\r\nany form of honest labour; and it was very sore to her to have no power\r\nof preventing them, ridicule, protest, or discouragement being all\r\nalike treated as the dear mother\'s old-world unpractical romance.  It\r\ngalled her likewise that she could perceive the determination that\r\nAnnaple Ruthven should be disposed of before Muriel Delmar came on the\r\nscene; and the retiring to ever so small a home of their own had been\r\ndiscussed between mother and daughter, and only put aside because of\r\nthe pain it would give their honest-hearted host and their hostess, who\r\nreally loved them.\r\n\r\nThus she did her best to persuade her old friend that there were few\r\nopenings for a man of his son\'s age, and that if the Micklethwayte\r\nbusiness were all that Mark imagined, it was not beneath the attention\r\neven of a well-born gentleman in these modern days, and would involve\r\nless delay than any other plan, except emigration, which was equally\r\ndreaded by each parent.  Delay there must be, not only in order to\r\nascertain the facts respecting the firm, but to prove whether Mark had\r\nany aptitude for the business before involving any capital in it.\r\nHowever, every other alternative would involve much longer and more\r\ndoubtful waiting.  And altogether the Canon felt that if a person of\r\nLady Ronnisglen\'s rank did not object, he had scarcely a right to do\r\nso.  However, both alike reserved consent until full inquiry should\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\nThe Canon wrote to Lord Kirkaldy, and in the meantime wanted to gather\r\nwhat information he could from his sister-in-law; but he found her\r\nabsolutely engrossed as her husband\'s nurse, and scarcely permitted to\r\nsnatch a meal outside the darkened room.  He groaned and grumbled at\r\nhis brother\'s selfishness, and declared that her health would be\r\ndamaged, while his shrewder lady declared that nothing would be so good\r\nfor her as to let Alwyn find her indispensable to his comfort, even\r\nbeyond Gregorio.\r\n\r\nThis absorption of her mother fell hard on Ursula, especially when the\r\nfirst two days\' alarm was over, and her mother was still kept an entire\r\nprisoner, as companion rather than nurse.  As before, the rheumatic\r\nattack fastened upon the head and eyes, causing lengthened suffering,\r\nand teaching Mr. Egremont that he had never had so gentle, so skilful,\r\nso loving, or altogether so pleasant a slave as his wife, the only\r\nperson except Gregorio whom, in his irritable state, he would tolerate\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nHis brother could not be entirely kept out, but was never made welcome,\r\nmore especially when he took upon himself to remonstrate on Alice\'s\r\nbeing deprived of air, exercise, and rest.  He got no thanks; Mr.\r\nEgremont snarled, and Alice protested that she was never tired, and\r\nneeded nothing.  The Rectory party were, excepting the schoolroom\r\ngirls, engaged to make visits from home before going into residence at\r\nRedcastle, and were to begin with Monks Horton.  They offered to escort\r\nUrsula to see her great aunt at Micklethwayte--Oh joy of joys!--but\r\nwhen the Canon made the proposition in his brother\'s room, Mr. Egremont\r\ncut it short with \'I\'m not going to have her running after those\r\numbrella-mongers.\'\r\n\r\nThe Canon\'s heart sank within him at the tone, and he was really very\r\nsorry for his niece, who was likely to have a fortnight or three weeks\r\nof comparative solitude before her father was ready to set out on the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t she help you, in reading to her father--or anything?\' he asked\r\nAlice, who had come out with him into the anteroom to express her warm\r\nthanks for the kind proposal.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.  \'He would not like it, nor I, for her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should think not!\' exclaimed the Canon, as his eye fell on the title\r\nof a yellow French book on the table.  \'I have heard of this! Does he\r\nmake you read such as this to him, Alice?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing else seems to amuse him,\' she said.  \'Do you, think I ought\r\nnot?  I don\'t understand much of that kind of modern French, but Nuttie\r\nknows it better.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not _that kind_, I hope,\' said the Canon hastily.  No, no, my dear,\'\r\nas he saw her colour mantling, \'small blame to you.  You have only to\r\ndo the best you can with him, poor fellow!  Then we\'ll take anything\r\nfor you.  We\'ve said nothing to Nuttie, Jane said I had better ask you\r\nfirst.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that was kind!  I am glad she is spared the disappointment.\'\r\n\r\nNot that she was.  For when she learnt her cousins\' destination, she\r\nentreated to go with them, and had to be told that the proposal had\r\nbeen made and refused.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that she behaved very ill.  It was the first real\r\nsharp collision of wills.  She had differed from, and disapproved of,\r\nher father all along, but what had been required of her had generally\r\nbeen pleasant to one side at least of her nature; but here she was\r\ncondemned to the dulness of the lonely outsider to a sick room, when\r\nher whole soul was leaping back to the delights of her dear old home at\r\nMicklethwayte.\r\n\r\nShe made her mother\'s brief meal with her such a misery of protests and\r\ninsistences on pleadings with her father that poor Alice was fain to\r\nrejoice when the servants\' presence silenced her, and fairly fled from\r\nher when the last dish was carried out.\r\n\r\nWhen they met again Nuttie demanded, \'Have you spoken to my father?\'\r\n\r\n\'I told you, my dear, it would be of no use?\'\r\n\r\n\'You promised.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Nuttie, I did not.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I understood you to say you would if you could.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was your hopes, my dear child.  He is quite determined.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you leave him so.  Mother, I can\'t understand your submitting to\r\nshow such cruel ingratitude!\'\r\n\r\nNuttie was very angry, though she was shocked at the burning colour and\r\nhot tears that she beheld as, half choked, her mother said: \'Oh, my\r\ndear, my dear, do not speak so!  You know--you know it is not in my\r\nheart, but my first duty, and yours too, is to your father.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whatever he tells us?\' demanded Nuttie, still hot and angry.\r\n\r\n\'I did not say that,\' returned her mother gently, \'but you know,\r\nNuttie, Aunt Ursel herself would say that it is our duty to abide by\r\nhis decision here.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you could speak to him,\' still argued Nuttie, \'what\'s the use of\r\nhis being so fond of you if he won\'t do anything you want?\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush! hush, Nuttie! you know that is not a right way of speaking.  I\r\ncannot worry him now he is ill.  You don\'t know what that dreadful pain\r\nis!\'\r\n\r\nHappily Nuttie did refrain from saying, \'No doubt it makes him very\r\ncross;\' but she muttered, \'And so we are to be cut off for ever from\r\nAunt Ursel, and Miss Mary, and--and--every thing good--and nice--and\r\ncatholic?\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope not, indeed, I hope not.  Only he wants us to get the good\r\nsociety manners and tone--like your cousins, you know.  You are young\r\nenough for it, and a real Egremont, you know Nuttie, and when you have\r\nlearnt it, he will trust you there,\' said the mother, making a very\r\nmild version of his speech about the umbrella-mongers.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he wants to make me worldly, so that I should not care, but that\r\nhe never shall do, whatever you may let him do to you.\'\r\n\r\nHis bell rang sharply, and away hurried Alice, leaving her daughter\r\nwith a miserably sore and impatient heart, and the consciousness of\r\nhaving harshly wounded the mother whom she had meant to protect.  And\r\nthere was no hugging and kissing to make up for it possible.  They\r\nwould not meet till dinner-time, and Nuttie\'s mood of stormy repentance\r\nhad cooled before that time into longing to be more tender than usual\r\ntowards her mother, but how was that possible during the awful\r\nhousehold ceremony of many courses, with three solemn men-servants\r\nministering to them?\r\n\r\nAnd poor Alice jumped up at the end, and ran away as if afraid of fresh\r\nobjurgations, so that all Nuttie could do was to rush headlong after\r\nher, catch her on the landing, kiss her face all over, and exclaim,\r\n\'Oh, mother, mother, I was dreadfully cross!\'\r\n\r\n\'There, there!  I knew you would be sorry, dear, dear child, I know it\r\nis very hard, but let me go.  He wants me!\'\r\n\r\nAnd a very forlorn and deplorable person was left behind, feeling as if\r\nher father, after carrying her away from everything else that she\r\nloved, had ended by robbing her of her mother.\r\n\r\nShe stood on the handsome staircase, and contrasted it with the little\r\ncosy entrance at her aunt\'s.  She felt how she hated all these fine\r\nsurroundings, and how very good and unworldly she was for so doing.\r\nOnly, was it good to have been so violent towards her mother?\r\n\r\nThe Rectory folks were dining out, so she could only have recourse to\r\nMudie\'s box to try to drive dull care away.\r\n\r\nA few days more and they were gone.  Though Mr. Egremont was gradually\r\nmending, he still required his wife to be in constant attendance.  In\r\npoint of fact Alice could not, and in her loyalty would not, tell her\r\ndignified brother-in-law, far less her daughter, of the hint that the\r\ndoctor had given her, namely, that her husband was lapsing into the\r\nconstant use of opiates, founded at first on the needs of his malady,\r\nbut growing into a perilous habit, which accounted for his shutting\r\nhimself up all the forenoon.\r\n\r\nWhile under medical treatment it was possible to allowance him, and\r\nkeep him under orders, but Dr. Hamilton warned her not to allow the\r\nquantity to be exceeded or the drugs to be resorted to after his\r\nrecovery, speaking seriously of the consequences of indulgence.  He\r\nspoke as a duty, but as he looked at the gentle, timid woman, he saw\r\nlittle hope of her doing any good!\r\n\r\nPoor Alice was appalled.  All she could do was to betake herself to\r\n\'the little weapon called All-Prayer,\' and therewith to use all\r\nvigilance and all her arts of coaxing and cheering away weariness and\r\nlanguor, beguiling sleeplessness, soothing pain by any other means. She\r\nhad just enough success to prevent her from utterly despairing, and to\r\nkeep her always on the strain, and at her own cost, for Mr. Egremont\r\nwas far more irritable when he was without the narcotic, and the\r\nserenity it produced was an absolute relief.  She soon found too that\r\nGregorio was a contrary power.  Once, when he had suggested the dose,\r\nand she had replied by citing the physician\'s commands, Mr. Egremont\r\nhad muttered an imprecation on doctors, and she had caught a horrible\r\ngrin of hatred on the man\'s face, which seemed to her almost\r\ndiabolical.  She had prevailed then, but the next time her absence was\r\nat all prolonged, she found that the opiate had been taken, and her\r\ndread of quitting her post increased, though she did not by any means\r\nalways succeed.  Sometimes she was good-humouredly set aside, sometimes\r\nroughly told to mind her own business; but she could not relinquish the\r\nstruggle, and whenever she did succeed in preventing the indulgence she\r\nfelt a hopefulness that--in spite of himself and Gregorio, she might\r\nyet save him.\r\n\r\nAnother hint she had from both the Canon and his wife.  When they asked\r\nwhat place was chosen, Mr. Egremont said he had made Alice write to\r\ninquire of the houses to be had at various resorts--Mentone, Nice,\r\nCannes, and the like.  She was struck by the ardour with which they\r\nboth began to praise Nice, Genoa, Sorrento, any place in preference to\r\nMentone, which her husband seemed to know and like the best.\r\n\r\nAnd when she went downstairs with them the Canon held her hand a\r\nmoment, and said, \'Anywhere but Mentone, my dear.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked bewildered for a moment, and the Canoness added, \'Look in\r\nthe guide-books.\'\r\n\r\nThen she remembered Monte Carlo, and for a moment it was to her as\r\nshocking a warning as if she had been bidden to keep her husband out of\r\nthe temptation of thieving.\r\n\r\nShe resolved, however, to do her best, feeling immediately that again\r\nit was a pull of her influence against Gregorio\'s.  Fortune favoured\r\nher so far that the villa favoured by Mr. Egremont was not to be had,\r\nonly the side of the bay he disliked, and that a pleasant villa offered\r\nat Nice.\r\n\r\nShould she close with it?  Well--was there great haste?  Gregorio knew\r\na good many people at Mentone, and could ascertain in his own way if\r\nthey could get the right side of the bay by going to the hotel and\r\nwaiting.  Alice, however, pressed the matter--represented the danger of\r\nfalling between two stools, pleaded personal preference, and whereas\r\nMr. Egremont was too lazy for resistance to any persuasion, she\r\nobtained permission to engage the Nice villa.  The next day Gregorio\r\nannounced that he had heard that the proprietor of Villa Francaleone at\r\nMentone was giving up hopes of his usual tenants, and an offer might\r\nsecure it.\r\n\r\n\'Villa Eugenie at Nice is taken,\' said Alice, and she received one of\r\nthose deadly black looks, which were always like a stab.\r\n\r\nOf all this Nuttie knew nothing.  She was a good deal thrown with the\r\nschoolroom party and with the curate\'s wife for companionship.  Now\r\nMrs. Edwards did not approve of even the canonical Egremonts, having an\r\nideal far beyond the ritual of Bridgefield; and she was delighted to\r\nfind how entirely Miss Egremont sympathised with her.\r\n\r\nNuttie described St. Ambrose\'s as a paradise of church observances and\r\nparish management, everything becoming embellished and all shortcomings\r\nforgotten in the loving mists of distance.  The harmonium was never out\r\nof tune; the choir-boys were only just naughty enough to show how\r\nwisely Mr. Spyers dealt with them; the surplices, one would think,\r\nnever needed washing; Mr. Dutton and Gerard Godfrey were paragons of\r\nlay helpers, and district visitors never were troublesome.  Mrs.\r\nEdwards listened with open ears, and together they bewailed the\r\nimpracticability of moving the Canon to raising Bridgefield to anything\r\napproaching to such a standard; while Nuttie absolutely cultivated her\r\nhome sickness.\r\n\r\nAccording to promise Blanche wrote to her from Monks Horton, and told\r\nher thus much--\'We have been all over your umbrella place.  It was very\r\ncurious.  Then we called upon Miss Headworth, who was quite well, and\r\nwas pleased to hear of you.\'\r\n\r\nBlanche was famous for never putting into a letter what her\r\ncorrespondent wanted to hear, but her stepmother wrote a much longer\r\nand more interesting letter to Mrs. Egremont.\r\n\r\n\'You will be glad to hear that we found your aunt quite well.  I\r\nsuppose it is not in the nature of things that you should not be\r\nmissed; but I should think your place as well supplied as could be\r\nhoped by that very handsome and superior Miss Nugent, with whom she\r\nlives.  I had a good deal of conversation with both; for you will be\r\nsurprised to hear that the Canon has consented to Mark\'s making the\r\nexperiment of working for a year in Greenleaf and Dutton\'s office, with\r\na view to entering the firm in future.  I was very anxious to\r\nunderstand from such true ladies what the position would be socially. I\r\nlonged to talk it over with you beforehand; but Alwyn could never spare\r\nyou, and it was not a subject to be broached without ample time for\r\ndiscussion.  We felt that though the Kirkaldys could tell us much, it\r\nwas only from the outside, whereas Miss Headworth could speak from\r\nwithin.  The decision is of course a blow to his father, and will be\r\nstill more so to the De Lyonnais family, but they have never done\r\nanything to entitle them to have a voice in the matter, and the\r\nKirkaldys agree with us that, though not a path of distinction, it is\r\none of honourable prosperity; and with this, if Mark is content, we\r\nhave no right to object, since his mind is set on present happiness\r\nrather than ambition.\'\r\n\r\nIt was a letter gratifying to Alice in its confidential tone, as well\r\nas in the evident approval of those surroundings which she loved so\r\nwell.  She read it to her husband, as she was desired to give him a\r\nmessage that the Canon had not written out of consideration for his\r\neyes.  He laughed the laugh that always jarred on her.  \'So Master Mark\r\nhas got his nose to the grindstone, has he?\' was his first exclamation,\r\nand, after some cogitation, \'The fellow wants to be married, depend on\r\nit!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think so?\' returned Alice wistfully.\r\n\r\n\'Think!  Why, you may see it in Jane\'s letter!  I wonder who it is! The\r\nlittle yellow Ruthven girl, most likely!  The boy is fool enough for\r\nanything!  I thought he would have mended his fortunes with Ursula, but\r\nhe\'s too proud to stomach that, I suppose!\'\r\n\r\n\'I did wish that!\' said Alice.  \'It would have set everything straight,\r\nand it would have been so nice for her.\'\r\n\r\n\'You should have cut out your daughter after your own pattern,\' he\r\nanswered; \'not let her be such a raw insignificant little spitfire.\r\n\'Tis a pity.  I don\'t want the estate to go out of the name, though I\r\nwon\'t leave it to an interfering prig like Mark unless he chooses to\r\ntake my daughter with it!\'\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this amiable speech was muttered and scarcely heard\r\nor attended to by Alice in her struggle to conceal the grief she felt\r\nat the uncompromising opinion of her child.  Nuttie might outgrow being\r\nraw, but there seemed less rather than more prospect of a better\r\nunderstanding with her father.  About a week later Mark made his\r\nappearance, timing it happily when his uncle was making his toilette,\r\nso that his aunt was taking a turn on the sunny terrace with Nuttie\r\nwhen the young man came hurrying up the garden.\r\n\r\n\'Mark!  What?  Are you come home?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not the others.  They are at Mr. Condamine\'s, I came last night--by\r\nway of Lescombe.  Edda, dear, it is all right!  Oh, I forgot you did\r\nnot know!  There was no seeing you before we went away.  Ah! by the by,\r\nhow is my uncle?\'\r\n\r\n\'Much better, except that using his eyes brings on the pain.  \'What is\r\nit, Mark?  Ah! I can guess,\' she said, aided no doubt by that\r\nconjecture of her husband\'s.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, yes!\' he answered, with a rapidity quite unlike himself.\r\n\'Why, Nuttie, how mystified you look!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I don\'t wonder at any one being glad to live at dear old\r\nMicklethwayte,\' said Nuttie slowly.  \'But, somehow, I didn\'t think it\r\nof you, Mark.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, that\'s not all!\' said her mother.\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' cried Nuttie, with a prolonged intonation.  \'Is it?--Oh, Mark!\r\ndid you _do it_ that night when you led the horse home?\'\r\n\r\n\'Even so, Nuttie!  And, Aunt Alice, Lady Ronnisglen is the best and\r\nbravest of old ladies, and the wisest.  Nobody objects but Lady Delmar,\r\nand she declares she shall not consider it an engagement till\r\nRonnisglen has been written to in Nepaul, as if he had anything to do\r\nwith it; but that matters the less, since they all insist on our\r\nwaiting till I\'ve had a year\'s trial at the office!  I suppose they\r\ncould not be expected to do otherwise, but it is a pity, for I\'m afraid\r\nLady Delmar will lead Annaple and her mother a life of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear Mark, I am delighted that it is all going so well.\'\r\n\r\n\'I knew you would be!  I told them I must tell _you_, though it is not\r\nto go any farther.\'\r\n\r\nSo that hope of Mark\'s restoration to the inheritance faded from Alice,\r\nand yet she could not be concerned for him.  She had never seen him in\r\nsuch good spirits, for the sense of failure and disappointment had\r\nalways been upon him; and the definite prospect of occupation, gilded\r\nby his hopes of Annaple, seemed to make a new man of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nAN OLD FRIEND.\r\n\r\n  \'My heart untravelled still returns to thee.\'--GOLDSMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo go abroad!  Such had been the fairy castle of Nuttie\'s life.  She\r\nhad dreamed of Swiss mountains, Italian pictures, Rheinland castles, a\r\nperpetual panorama of delight, and here she was in one of the great\r\nhotels of Paris, as little likely to see the lions of that city as she\r\nhad been to see those of London.\r\n\r\nThe party were halting for two days there because the dentist, on whom\r\nMr. Egremont\'s fine show of teeth depended, practised there; but Nuttie\r\nspent great part of the day alone in the sitting-room, and her hand-bag\r\nand her mother\'s, with all their books and little comforts, had been\r\nlost in the agony of landing.  Her mother\'s attendance was required all\r\nthe morning, or what was worse, she expected that it would be, and\r\nthough Nuttie\'s persistence dragged out the staid, silent English maid,\r\nwho had never been abroad before, to walk in the Tuilleries gardens,\r\nwhich they could see from their windows, both felt half-scared the\r\nwhole time.  Nuttie was quite unused to finding her own way\r\nunprotected, and Martin was frightened, cross, and miserable about the\r\nbags, which, she averred, had been left by Gregorio\'s fault.  She so\r\nhated Gregorio that only a sort of adoration which she entertained for\r\nMrs. Egremont  would have induced her to come tete-a-tete with him, and\r\nperhaps he was visiting his disappointment about Mentone on her.  In\r\nthe afternoon nothing was achieved but a drive in the Bois de Boulogne,\r\nwhen it was at once made evident that Mr. Egremont would tolerate no\r\nquestions nor exclamations.\r\n\r\nHis mouth was in no condition for eating in public, and he therefore\r\ndecreed that his wife and daughter should dine at the table d\'hote,\r\nwhile he was served alone by Gregorio.  This was a great boon to\r\nNuttie, and to her mother it recalled bridal days long past at Dieppe;\r\nbut what was their astonishment when on entering the room they beheld\r\nthe familiar face of Mr. Dutton!  It was possible for him to place\r\nhimself between them, and there is no describing the sense of rest and\r\nprotection his presence imparted to them, more especially to Nuttie.\r\n\r\nHe had come over, as he did from time to time, on business connected\r\nwith the materials he used, and he was beguiled into telling them of\r\nhis views of Mark, whom he had put in the way of learning the\r\npreliminaries needful to an accountant.  He had a deep distrust of the\r\nbusiness capacities and perseverance of young gentlemen of family,\r\nespecially with a countess-aunt in the neighbourhood, and quoted Lord\r\nEldon\'s saying that to make a good lawyer of one, it was needful for\r\nhim to have spent both his own and his wife\'s fortune to begin with,\r\nbut he allowed that young Mr. Egremont was a very favourable specimen,\r\nand was resolutely applying himself to his work, and that he himself\r\nfelt it due to him to give all the assistance possible.\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth, he could not deny, had aged, but far less than Mrs.\r\nNugent in the past year, and it really was a great comfort to Miss Mary\r\nto have the old ladies together.  He told too how the mission, now\r\nlately over, had stirred the Micklethwayte folk into strong excitement,\r\nand how good works had been undertaken, evil habits renounced,\r\nreconciliations effected, religious services frequented. Would it last?\r\nNobody, he said, had taken it up so zealously as Gerard Godfrey, who\r\nseemed as if he would fain throw everything up, and spend his whole\r\nlife in some direct service as a home missionary or something of the\r\nkind.  \'He is a good fellow,\' said Mr. Dutton, \'and it is quite\r\ngenuine, but I made him wait at least a year, that he may be sure that\r\nthis is not only a passing impulse.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie thought that she knew what was the impulse that had actuated\r\nhim, and felt a pleasant elation and self-consciousness even while she\r\nrepressed a sigh of pity for herself and for him.  Altogether the dip\r\ninto the Micklethwayte world was delightful, but when Mr. Dutton began\r\nto ask Nuttie what she had seen, she burst out with, \'Nothing--nothing\r\nbut just a walk and a drive in the Bois de Boulogne;\' and her mother\r\nexplained that \'in Mr. Egremont\'s state of health,\' etc.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder,\' asked Mr. Dutton, \'if I might be allowed--\'\r\n\r\nNuttie\'s eyes sparkled with ecstasy.\r\n\r\nIt ended in her mother, who had been wondering how Mr. Egremont could\r\nbe amused all the long evening, arranging that Mr. Dutton should come\r\nin an hour\'s time to call on him, on the chance of being admitted, and\r\nthat then the offer might be made when she had prepared him for it,\r\nadvising Nuttie to wait in her own room.  She was beginning to learn\r\nhow to steer between her husband and her daughter, and she did not\r\nguess that her old friend was sacrificing one of the best French plays\r\nfor the chance.\r\n\r\nIt turned out well; Mr. Egremont was conscious of a want of variety. He\r\ndemanded whether it was the young fellow, and being satisfied on that\r\npart, observed in almost a good-humoured tone, \'So, we are in for\r\numbrellas, we may as well go in for the whole firm!\' caused the lights\r\nto be lowered under pretext of his eyes--to conceal the lack of\r\nteeth--did not absolutely refuse to let Nuttie take advantage of the\r\nescort, and when Mr. Dutton did come to the anteroom of the apartment,\r\nhe was received with full courtesy, though Gregorio looked unutterable\r\ncontempt.  Mr. Dutton was a man who could talk, and had seen a good\r\ndeal of the world at different times.  Mr. Egremont could appreciate\r\nintelligent conversation, so that they got on wonderfully well\r\ntogether, over subjects that would have been a mere weariness to Nuttie\r\nbut for the exceeding satisfaction of hearing a Micklethwayte voice.\r\nAt last Mr. Dutton said something about offering his escort to the\r\nladies, or to Miss Egremont, who used, he said in a paternal way, to be\r\na little playfellow of his; Mr. Egremont really smiled, and said, \'Ay,\r\nay, the child is young enough to run after sights. Well, thank you, if\r\nyou are so good as to take the trouble, they will be very grateful to\r\nyou, or if her mother cannot go with her, there\'s the maid.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie thought she had never known him so amiable, and hardly durst\r\nbelieve her good fortune would not turn the wheel before morning. And\r\nit so far did that her mother found, or thought she found, that it\r\nwould not do to be out of call, and sent the silent Martin in her\r\nstead.  But Mr. Dutton had set telegraphs to work and recovered the\r\nbags, which Gregorio had professed to give up in despair.\r\n\r\nA wonderful amount of lionising was contrived by Mr. Dutton, who had\r\nlived a few years at Paris in early youth, and had made himself\r\nacquainted alike with what was most worth seeing, and the best ways and\r\nmeans of seeing it, so that as little time as possible was wasted on\r\nthe unimportant.  It was one of the white days of Nuttie\'s life,\r\nwanting nothing but her mother\'s participation in the sight of the St.\r\nMichael of the Louvre, of the Sainte Chapelle, of the vistas in Notre\r\nDame, and of poor Marie Antoinette\'s cell,--all that they had longed to\r\nsee together.\r\n\r\nShe had meant to tell Mr. Dutton that it was all her father\'s\r\nselfishness, but somehow she could not say so, there was something\r\nabout him that hindered all unbefitting outbreaks of vexation.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, when she mentioned her disappointment at not being allowed to\r\ngo to Micklethwayte with her uncle, he answered, \'You could not of\r\ncourse be spared with your father so unwell.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, he never let me come near him!  I wasn\'t of the slightest use to\r\nhim!\'\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Egremont would have missed you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Really he never gave her time.  He perfectly devours her, body and\r\nsoul.  Oh dear, no!  \'Twas for no good I was kept there, but just pride\r\nand ingratitude, though mother tried to call it being afraid for my\r\nmanners and my style.\'\r\n\r\n\'In which, if you lapse into such talk, you fully justify the\r\nprecaution.  I was just thinking what a young lady you had grown into,\'\r\nhe answered in a tone of banter, under which, however, she felt a\r\nrebuke; and while directing her attention to the Pantheon, he took care\r\nto get within hearing again of Martin.\r\n\r\nAnd in looking at these things, he carried her so far below the\r\nsurface.  St. Michael was not so much Raffaelle\'s triumph of art as the\r\neternal victory over sin; the Sainte Chapelle, spite of all its modern\r\nunsanctified gaudiness, was redolent of St. Louis; and the cell of the\r\nslaughtered queen was as a martyr\'s shrine, trod with reverence.  There\r\nwere associations with every turn, and Nuttie might have spent years at\r\nParis with another companion without imbibing so many impressions as on\r\nthis December day, when she came home so full of happy chatter that the\r\nguests at the table d\'hote glanced with amusement at the eager girl as\r\nmuch as with admiration at the beautiful mother.  Mr. Dutton had been\r\ninvited to come and take coffee and spend the evening with them again,\r\nbut Mr. Egremont\'s affairs with the dentist had been  completed, and he\r\nhad picked up, or, more strictly speaking, Gregorio had hunted up for\r\nhim, a couple of French acquaintances, who appeared before long and\r\nengrossed him entirely.\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton sat between the two ladies on a stiff dark-green sofa on the\r\nopposite side of the room, and under cover of the eager,\r\nhalf-shrieking, gesticulating talk of the Frenchmen they had a quiet\r\nlow-toned conversation, like old times, Alice said.  \'More than old\r\ntimes,\' Nuttie added, and perhaps the others both agreed with her.\r\n\r\nWhen the two Englishwomen started at some of the loud French tones,\r\nalmost imagining they were full of rage and fury, their friend smiled\r\nand said that such had been his first notion on coming abroad.\r\n\r\n\'You have been a great deal abroad?\' Mrs. Egremont asked; \'you seem\r\nquite at home in Paris.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, mamma, he showed me where the school was that he went to, and the\r\nhouse where he lived!  Up such an immense way!\'\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton was drawn on to tell more of his former life than ever had\r\nbeen known to them.  His father, a wine merchant, had died a bankrupt\r\nwhen he was ten years old, and a relation, engaged in the same business\r\nat Paris, had offered to give him a few years of foreign schooling, and\r\nthen make him useful in the business.\r\n\r\nHis excellent mother had come with him, and they had lived together on\r\nvery small means, high up in a many-storied lodging-house, while he\r\ndaily attended the Lycie.  His reminiscences were very happy of those\r\ndays of cheerful contrivance, of her eager desire to make the tiny\r\nappartement a home to her boy, of their pleasant Sundays and holidays,\r\nand the life that in this manner was peculiarly guarded by her\r\ninfluence, and the sense of being all she had upon earth.  He had\r\nscarcely ever spoken of her before, and he dwelt on her now with a\r\ntenderness that showed how she had been the guiding spirit of his life.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen he was taken into the office at Marseilles, and she went\r\nthither with him, but the climate did not agree with her; she drooped,\r\nand, moreover, he discovered that the business was not conducted in the\r\nhonourable manner he had supposed.  After a few months of weighing his\r\nobligations to his kinsman against these instincts, the question was\r\nsolved by his cousin\'s retiring.  He resolved to take his mother back\r\nto England at any loss, and falling in with one of the partners of the\r\numbrella firm in quest of French silk, he was engaged as foreign\r\ncorrespondent, and brought his mother to Micklethwayte, but not in time\r\nto restore her health, and he had been left alone in the world just as\r\nhe came of age, when a small legacy came to him from his cousin, too\r\nlate for her to profit by it. It had been invested in the business, and\r\nhe had thus gradually risen to his present position.  Mrs. Egremont was\r\namazed to hear that his mother had only been dead so short a time\r\nbefore she had herself come to Micklethwayte; and fairly apologised for\r\nthe surprise she could not help betraying at finding how youthful he\r\nhad then been, and Nuttie exclaimed, in her original unguarded fashion:\r\n\r\n\'Why, Mr. Dutton, I always thought you were an old bachelor!\'\r\n\r\n\'Nuttie, my dear!\' said her mother in a note of warning, but Mr. Dutton\r\nlaughed and said:\r\n\r\n\'Not so far wrong!  They tell me I never was a young man.\'\r\n\r\n\'You had always to be everything to your mother,\' said Mrs. Egremont\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' he said, \'and a very blessed thing it was for me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! you don\'t regret now all that you must have always been giving up\r\nfor her,\' returned Alice.\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed.  Only that I did not give up more.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is always the way.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is indeed.  One little knows the whips that a little self-will\r\nprepares.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie thought he said it for her admonition, and observed, \'But she\r\nwas good,\' only, however, in a mumble, that the other two thought it\r\ninexpedient to notice, though it made both hearts ache for her, even\r\nAlice\'s--with an additional pang of self-reproach that she herself was\r\nnot good enough to help her daughter better.\r\n\r\nNeither of them guessed at the effect that a glimpse of the lovely\r\nyoung seeming widow had had on the already grave self-restrained young\r\nman in the home lately made lonely, how she had been his secret object\r\nfor years, and how, when her history was revealed to him, he had still\r\nhoped on for a certainty which had come at last as so fatal a shock and\r\noverthrow to all his dreams.\r\n\r\nA life of self-restraint and self-conquest had rendered it safe for him\r\nto thoroughly enjoy the brief intercourse, which had come about by the\r\naccident of his having come to dine at the Hotel de Louvre, to meet a\r\nfriend who had failed him.\r\n\r\nThese were two completely happy hours to all the three, and when they\r\nsaid \'good-night\' there was a sense of soothing and invigoration on\r\nAlice\'s mind; and on Nuttie\'s that patience and dutifulness were the\r\nbest modes of doing justice to her Micklethwayte training, although he\r\nhad scarcely said a word of direct rebuke or counsel.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Dutton sped home to tell Miss Headworth that Mrs. Egremont\r\nlooked lovelier than ever, and was--yes she was--more of an angel, that\r\nher husband had been very pleasant, much better than he expected, and,\r\nindeed, might come to anything good under such influence; and as to\r\nlittle Nuttie--she was developing fast, and had a brave constant heart,\r\naltogether at Micklethwayte.  But that servant who was acting as\r\ncourier was an insolent scoundrel, who was evidently cheating them to\r\nthe last degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nA FRIEND IN NEED.\r\n\r\n  \'True courage often is in frightened eyes.\'--\r\n                                 Thoughts and Verses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the preliminaries of the sojourn at Nice had been settled in\r\ncorrespondence, and the Egremont family had nothing to do, after\r\narriving at the station, but to drive up to Villa Eugenie, whose\r\nflower-wreathed balconies were like a vision of beauty.  Servants had\r\nbeen hired through agencies known to Mr. Egremont, and Gregorio looked\r\nvery black at his mistress keeping the reins in her hand, and tried to\r\nmake her feel herself inefficient.\r\n\r\nIt was not an eventful or very interesting part of Ursula\'s life. She\r\nwas almost wild with the novelty and beauty of the South at first, but\r\nexcept for what she could thus see, there was little variety.  The\r\nmould of the day was as much as possible after the Bridgefield fashion,\r\nexcept that there were no cousins at the Rectory, no parish interests,\r\nvery little society, as far as the ladies were concerned.  Mr. Egremont\r\nhad old acquaintance and associates with whom he spent afternoons and\r\nevenings, after his own fashion, but they were not people to whom he\r\nwished to introduce his wife and daughter.\r\n\r\nAnd the superior English habitues of Nice, the families who formed the\r\nregular society, knew Mr. Egremont\'s reputation sufficiently to feel by\r\nno means disposed to be cordial to the fair wife and grown-up daughter\r\nwhom he so unexpectedly produced on the scene.  It had been different\r\nat home, where he had county standing, and the Canon and Canoness\r\nanswered for the newcomers; but here, where all sorts of strange people\r\ncame to the surface, the respectable felt it needful to be very\r\ncautious, and though of course one or two ladies had been asked to call\r\nthrough the intervention of Lady Kirkaldy or of Mrs. William Egremont,\r\nand had been assured on their authority that it was \'all right,\' their\r\nattentions were clogged by doubt, and by reluctance to involve their\r\nmankind in intimacy with the head of the family.  Thus very little of\r\nthe proverbial gaiety of Nice offered itself to Nuttie and her mother,\r\nand, except by a clerical family who knew Mr. Spyers, they were kept at\r\na distance, which Mr. Egremont perceived and resented by permitting no\r\nadvances.  The climate suited him so well that, to his wife\'s great\r\nrelief, he seemed to have dropped his inclination for sedatives; but\r\nhis eyes would not bear much, and she felt bound to be always on the\r\nalert, able to amuse him and hinder his feeling it dull.  Gregorio\r\nhighly disapproved of the house and servants, and was always giving\r\nhints that Mentone would agree far better with his master; but every\r\nday that Mr. Egremont seemed sufficiently amused at Nice was so much\r\ngain, and she had this in her favour, that he was always indolent and\r\nhard to move. Moreover, between his master\'s levee and late dinner\r\nGregorio was hardly ever to be found.  No doubt he knew the way to\r\nMonte Carlo well enough, and perhaps preferred that the family should\r\nbe farther off, for he soon ceased to show himself discontented with\r\ntheir present abode.  Once when his absence was inconvenient, Mr.\r\nEgremont abused him roundly as a good-for-nothing gambler, but when\r\nAlice hoped that he might be called to a reckoning, the wrath had\r\nsubsided with the immediate vexation, and as usual she was told \'All\r\nthose fellows were alike.\'\r\n\r\nThe foreign servants were not to be induced to give the early-rising\r\nladies more than a roll and cup of coffee, and Nuttie felt ravenous\r\ntill she learned to lay in a stock of biscuits, and, with Martin\'s\r\nconnivance, made tea on her own account, and sustained her mother for\r\nthe morning\'s walk before the summons to Mr. Egremont.\r\n\r\nHe always wanted his wife much earlier in the day, during his hours of\r\ndeshabille, and letting her write his letters and read the papers to\r\nhim.  She was pleased with this advance, but it gave Nuttie a great\r\ndeal more solitude, which was sometimes judiciously spent, but it was\r\nvery hard not to be desultory in spite of learning lessons in French,\r\nItalian, and drawing.\r\n\r\nLater in the day came the drive or the visit to the public gardens when\r\nthe band was playing, but this became less frequent as Mr. Egremont\r\nobserved the cold civility shown to his wife, and as he likewise grew\r\nstronger and made more engagements of his own.  Then Nuttie had happy\r\nafternoons of driving, donkey-riding, or walking with her mother,\r\nsketching, botanising, admiring, and laying up stores for the long\r\ndescriptive letters that delighted the party in St. Ambrose\'s Road,\r\ndrinking in all the charm of the scenery, and entering into it\r\nintelligently.  They spent a good many evenings alone together\r\nlikewise, and it could not but give Alice a pang to see the gladness\r\nher daughter did not repress when this was the case, even though to\r\nherself it meant relaxation of the perpetual vigilance she had to exert\r\nwhen the father and daughter were together to avert collisions.  They\r\nwere certainly not coming nearer to one another, though Nuttie was\r\nbehaving very well and submissively on the whole, and seldom showing\r\nsymptoms of rebellion.  This went on through the early part of their\r\nstay, but latterly there was a growing sense upon the girl that she and\r\nher mother were avoided by some young ladies to whom they had been\r\nintroduced, and whom they saw regularly at the daily services at St.\r\nMichael\'s Church.  They were pleasant-looking girls, with whom Nuttie\r\nlonged to fraternise, and she was mortified at never being allowed to\r\nget beyond a few frigidly civil words in the street, more especially\r\nwhen she came upon sketching parties and picnics in which she was never\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well for her mother to answer her murmurs and\r\nwonderings with \'You know people are very exclusive, my dear.\' Nuttie\r\nbegan to guess that her father and her name were the real reason, and\r\nher eyes were further opened later in the spring when Mr. Egremont, who\r\nhad recovered unusual health and vigour, took his ladies to Mentone to\r\nspend a day or two in the newer beauties there. Alice had her\r\nmisgivings, but the visit was avowedly to show the place to her, and\r\nshe could not reasonably object.  He was in unusual good humour, and\r\neven tolerated their ecstasies at the scenery and the flowers, dined at\r\nthe table d\'hote and found acquaintance, enjoyed himself, and in the\r\nforenoon, while Nuttie was out wondering and admiring, and going as far\r\nas she could drag Martin, he expressed to his wife that she would be\r\nastonished at the gardens and the music of Monte Carlo.\r\n\r\nThere, however, Alice made a stand.  \'Thank you, it is very kind, but\r\nif you please, I should not like to take Ursula to Monte Carlo, or to\r\ngo there myself,\' she said in an apologetic tone.\r\n\r\nHe laughed.  \'What! you are afraid of making the little one a confirmed\r\ngambler?\'\r\n\r\n\'You know I am not, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'You think the little prig will be contaminated, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I think it will be happier for her if she never sees\r\nanything--of the kind.\'\r\n\r\n\'You little foolish Edda, as if her eyes or ears need see anything but\r\nflowers and music and good company.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know that, but I had so much rather not.  It was a sweet face and\r\ncaressing voice that implored, and he still was good humoured.\r\n\r\n\'Well, well, I don\'t want to drag you, old lady, against your will,\r\nthough I fancy you would be rather surprised at the real aspect of the\r\nabode of iniquity your fancy depicts.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, thank you, thank you so much!\'\r\n\r\n\'What an absurd little woman it is!  I wonder if you would thank me as\r\nheartily supposing I cleared a round thousand and gave you--say a\r\ndiamond necklace?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure I should not!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I don\'t believe you would.  That restless little conscience of\r\nyours would be up on end.  After all, I don\'t know that you are the\r\nworse for it, when it looks so prettily out of your brown eyes.  I\r\nwonder what you expect to see?  The ruined gamester shooting himself on\r\nevery path, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no; I don\'t suppose I should see anything horrid or even\r\ndisagreeable.  I know it is all very beautiful; but then every person\r\nwho goes for the innocent pleasures\' sake only helps to keep up the\r\nwhole thing--evil and all.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what would the old women of all sorts here and at Nice do without\r\nsuch a choice temple of scandal to whet their teeth upon? Well, I\r\nsuppose you and your precious daughter can take care of yourselves.\r\nThere are the gardens, or you can tell Gregorio to order you a\r\ncarriage.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you are going?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I promised Grafton.  Don\'t be afraid, Mistress Edda, I\'m not\r\ngoing to stake Bridgefield and reduce you to beggary.  I\'m an old hand,\r\nand was a cool one in my worst days, and whatever I get I\'ll hand over\r\nto appease you.\'\r\n\r\nThat was all she could obtain, and she secretly hoped there would be no\r\nwinnings to perplex her.  Thankful that she had not made him angry by\r\nthe resistance for which she had prepared herself with secret prayer\r\never since the Mentone scheme had been proposed, she placed herself at\r\nNuttie\'s disposition for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nThey had a charming donkey-ride, and, still unsatiated with beauty,\r\nUrsula made her mother come out again to wonder at the trees in the\r\npublic gardens.  Rather tired, they were sitting on a shaded bench,\r\nwhen a voice close to them exclaimed, \'It is; yes, it must be; \'tis the\r\nvoice--yes, and the face prettier than ever.  Little Alice--ah! you\r\ndon\'t know me.  Time has been kinder to you than to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!  I know you now!  I beg your pardon,\' cried Alice, recognising in\r\nthe thin nutcracker parchment visage and shabbily-dressed figure the\r\nremnant of the brilliant aquiline countenance and gay attire of\r\neighteen years ago.  \'Mrs. Houghton!  I am so glad to have met you, you\r\nwere so kind to me.  And here she is.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! is this the child?  Bless me, what a proof how time goes! Young\r\nlady, you\'ll excuse my not knowing you.  You were a very inconvenient\r\npersonage not quite born when I last met your mother. What a likeness!\r\nI could have known her for Alwyn Egremont\'s daughter anywhere!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, they all say she is a thorough Egremont.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it is all right.  I saw Alwyn Egremont, Esquire, and family among\r\nthe arrivals at Nice, but I hardly durst expect that it was you.  It\r\nseemed too good to be true, though I took care the knot should be tied\r\nfaster than my gentleman suspected.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, please!\' cried Alice deprecatingly, at first not apprehending the\r\nforce of the words, having never known the gulf from which Mrs.\r\nHoughton had saved her, and that lady, seeing that the girl was\r\nlistening with all her ears, thought of little pitchers and restrained\r\nher reminiscences, asking with real warm interest, \'And how was it?\r\nHow did you meet him again?\'\r\n\r\n\'He came and found me out,\' said Alice, with satisfaction in her voice.\r\n\r\n\'Indeed!  Not at Dieppe; for he was en garcon when I nearly came across\r\nhim ten years ago at Florence.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no!  He inquired at Dieppe, but they had lost the address my aunt\r\nleft.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed!  I should not have thought it of old Madame Leroux, she seemed\r\nso thoroughly interested in la pauvre petite.  What did you do?  Your\r\naunt wrote to me when your troubles were safely over, and she thought\r\nhim lost in the poor Ninon, that she meant to settle in a place with an\r\nawfully long Yorkshire name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Micklethwayte; yes, we lived there, and got on very well.  We had\r\nboarders, and I had some dear little pupils; but last year Mark\r\nEgremont--you remember dear little Mark--was in the neighbourhood, and\r\nhearing my name, he told his uncle, who had been seeking us ever since.\r\nAnd he came, Mr. Egremont, and took us home, and oh, the family have\r\nbeen so kind!\'\r\n\r\n\'What?  The parson, and that awful old she-lion of a grandmother, whose\r\nvery name scared you out of your wits?\'\r\n\r\n\'She is dead, and so is dear good Lady Adelaide.  Canon Egremont is\r\nkindness itself.  It was all the old lady\'s doing, and he knew nothing\r\nabout it.  He was gone to Madeira with Lady Adelaide and got none of\r\nour letters, and he never knew that his brother was married to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Trust Alwyn for that,\' Mrs. Houghton muttered.  \'Well, all\'s well that\r\nends well, and I hope he feels due gratitude to me for doing him a good\r\nturn against his will.  I tried to get at him at Florence to find out\r\nwhat he had done with you, but unluckily I was ill, and had to send\r\nthrough poor Houghton, and he mismanaged it of course, though I\r\nactually wrote down that barbarous address, Mickle something, on a\r\ncard.  I believe he only got as far as the man instead of the master.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  I wanted to ask for Captain Houghton,\' said Alice, glad to lead\r\nthe conversation away from revelations of which she had an instinctive\r\ndread.\r\n\r\n\'Gone, my dear! two years ago.  Poor fellow! it was low fever, but\r\nquite as much want of luck, I shall always believe,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I am sorry!  He was so kind to me!\' said Alice, squeezing her\r\nhand, and looking up with sweet tender commiseration.\r\n\r\n\'There, there, don\'t, you pretty creature!\' said Mrs. Houghton, putting\r\nher hand across her eyes.  \'I declare, you\'ve almost made me cry--which\r\nI\'ve not done--well, hardly, since I parted with you at Dieppe,\r\nthinking you a sweet little flower plucked and thrown away to die,\r\nthough I had done my best to bind it to him.  What care I took not to\r\nlet Houghton disabuse him about Jersey marriages!\'\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between hearing and hearkening, and Alice\r\nEgremont\'s loving and unsuspecting heart was so entirely closed against\r\nevil thoughts of her husband, and so fully occupied with her old\r\nfriend\'s condition, that she never took in the signification of all\r\nthis, while Nuttie, being essentially of a far more shrewd and less\r\nconfiding nature, and already imbued with extreme distrust of her\r\nfather, was taking in all these revelations with an open-eyed, silent\r\nhorror of conviction that her old impressions of the likeness to\r\nMarmion or Theseus had been perfectly correct.  It was all under her\r\nhat, however, and the elder ladies never thought of her, Alice bringing\r\nback the conversation to Mrs. Houghton herself.  \'Oh, my dear, I drag\r\non as I can.  I\'ve got a fragment of our old income, and when that\'s\r\nrun too low, I go up to Monte Carlo--I always had the lucky hand, you\r\nknow, and \'tis only restitution after all!  I\'m sick of it all though,\r\nand sometimes think I\'ll take my good sister Anne\'s offers and go home.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh do, do!\' cried Alice.\r\n\r\n\'But,\' went on the poor woman, \'humble pie goes against me, and think\r\nwhat an amount would be before me--heigh ho!--after nearly\r\nfive-and-twenty years; yes, five-and-twenty years it is--since\r\nHoughton, poor fellow, told me I was too bright and winsome for a\r\nlittle country lawyer\'s house in a poky street.  What would they think\r\nof me now?\' and she laughed with a sound that was painful to hear.\r\n\'Well, Sycorax had done one good deed, and when I look at you, queening\r\nit there, I feel that so have I.\'\r\n\r\n\'You were very good to me, I know; but oh, if you would go home to your\r\nsister!\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, you little know what you ask!  Anne!  Why, she is the prime\r\ndistrict lady, or whatever you call it, of Dockforth.  Think what it\r\nwould be to her to have this battered old vaurien thrown on her hands,\r\nto be the stock subject for all the righteous tongues. Besides,\' as she\r\ncoughed, \'the English climate would make an end of me outright.  I\'m in\r\na bad way enough here, where I can sit among the lemon trees half the\r\ndays in the winter, but the English fireside in a stuffy parlour--\' and\r\nshe shuddered.\r\n\r\nThat shiver reminded all that it was getting late, too late for Mrs.\r\nHoughton to be out of doors, and near the time when Mr. Egremont was to\r\nmeet his ladies at the hotel.  Alice begged for Mrs. Houghton\'s\r\naddress, and it was given with a short ironical laugh at her promise to\r\ncall again if possible.  \'Ay, if possible,\' the poor woman repeated.\r\n\'I understand!  No, no,\' as Alice was about to kiss her. \'I won\'t have\r\nit done.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no one in sight.\'\r\n\r\n\'As if that made a difference!  Alice, child, you are as innocent as\r\nthe little dove that flew aboard the Ninon.  How have you done it? Get\r\nalong with you!  No kisses to such as me!  I don\'t know whether it\r\nbreaks my heart, or binds it up to look at the face of you. Anyway, I\r\ncan\'t bear it.\'\r\n\r\nShe hurried away, and made some steps from them.  A terrible paroxysm\r\nof coughing came on, and Mrs. Egremont hurried towards her, but she\r\nwaved back all help, shook her head, and insisted on going home. Alice\r\nkept her in sight, till she dived into a small side street.\r\n\r\n\'Mother,\' said Nuttie.  Then there was a pause.  \'Mother, did you know\r\nall this?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t talk of it, Nuttie.  It is not a thing to be talked about to any\r\none or by any one.  I wish you had not been there.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, mother, this once!  Did you know?\'\r\n\r\n\'I knew that I knew not what I did when I went on board that yacht, but\r\nthat God\'s kind providence was over me in a way that I little deserved.\r\nThat is all I care to know, and, Ursula, I will have not another word\r\nabout it.  No, I will not hear it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was only going to ask whether you would tell my father.\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly; but not before you.\'\r\n\r\nThe tone of decision was unwonted, and Nuttie knew she must abide by\r\nit, but the last shreds of filial respect towards Mr. Egremont were\r\ntorn away by what Mrs. Houghton had implied, and the girl dashed up and\r\ndown her bedroom muttering to herself, \'Oh, why have I such a father?\r\nAnd she, she will not see it, she is wilfully blind!  Why not break\r\nwith him and go home to dear Aunt Ursel and Gerard and Mr. Dutton at\r\nonce, instead of this horrid, horrid grandeur?  Oh, if I could fling\r\nall these fine things in his face, and have done with him for ever.\r\nSome day I will, when I am of age, and Gerard has won his way.\'\r\n\r\nMeantime Alice, in some trepidation, but with resolution at the bottom,\r\nhad told her husband of the meeting with Mrs. Houghton, of her\r\nwidowhood, sickness, and poverty.\r\n\r\nHe did not like the intelligence of their meeting, and hoped no one had\r\nseen it; then, when reassured on this score, he hummed a little and\r\nexclaimed, \'Poor old Flossy Houghton!  I don\'t wonder!  They went the\r\npace!  Well, what do you want?  Twenty pounds for her!  Why, \'twill all\r\nbe at Monte Carlo in three days\' time.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is very good of you, but I want more than that.  She is so ill and\r\nwretched, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t have you visiting her, if that\'s what you mean.  Why, after\r\nall the pains I\'ve been at to get you on your proper level at home,\r\nhere\'s my Lady Louisa and all her crew, in their confounded insolence,\r\nfighting shy of you, and you can\'t give them a better colour for it\r\nthan by running after a woman like that--divorced to begin with, and\r\nknown at every gambling table in Europe.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know that, Alwyn, dear Alwyn\' (it was very seldom that she called\r\nhim so, and she put her clasped hands on his shoulder); \'but I am sure\r\nshe is dying, and she was so good to me, I can\'t bear doing nothing for\r\nher.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, there\'s twenty--fifty, if you like.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, thank you, but you know I never meant to visit\r\nher--like--like society; only to go sometimes privately and--\'\r\n\r\n\'And how about your daughter?\'\r\n\r\n\'I would not take her on any account.  What I want to do is this. Mrs.\r\nHoughton spoke of her sister, a kind good woman in England, who would\r\ntake her home, and love her, if only she could bring herself to go.\r\nNow, I think I could persuade her to write, or let me write to the\r\nsister--and if only the two were together again!  It is very dreadful\r\nto think of her dying alone, in the way she is going on!\'\r\n\r\n\'What, little saint, you want to try your hand on her?  I should say\r\nshe was too tough an old sinner for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Alwyn! her heart was very near, though she tried to keep it back.\r\nI do not want to--to do what you mean--only to get her to let her\r\nsister come.  I\'m sure that would do the rest.\'\r\n\r\n\'If any sister does more than you, you little witch,\' he said.\r\n\r\nAlice pressed him no more then, but a day or two later, when she knew\r\nhe had an engagement, she arranged to dispose of Nuttie with the\r\nclergyman\'s wife, and then begged permission to go by train to Mentone,\r\nand come back in the evening.  He did not like it--no more did she--for\r\nshe was perfectly unaccustomed to travelling alone, but there was a\r\ndeep sense of sacred duty upon her, only strengthened by her\r\nunwillingness to realise how much she owed to Mrs. Houghton.\r\n\r\nShe telegraphed that she was coming, and found her friend more touched\r\nthan she chose to allow at the fact of her visit, declaring that she\r\nmust have wonderful power over Alwyn Egremont, if she knew how to use\r\nit; indeed, the whole tone was of what Alice felt flattery, intended to\r\nturn away anything more serious.  Poor woman, she was as careful of\r\ndoing no injury to her young friend\'s reputation as Mr. Egremont could\r\nhave desired.  Alice had come resolved that she should have one good\r\nmeal, but she would not hear of eating anywhere in public where either\r\ncould be recognised, and the food was brought to a private room in the\r\nhotel.  To her lodgings she still would not take Alice, nor would she\r\ngive her sister\'s address.  Except for a genuine shower of tears when\r\nAlice insisted on kissing her there seemed no ground gained.\r\n\r\nBut Alice went again on her husband\'s next visit to Mentone.  He was,\r\nto a certain degree, interested in her endeavours, and really wished\r\nthe poor woman to be under the charge of her relations, instead of\r\ndying a miserable lonely death among strangers.\r\n\r\nThis time Alice had to seek her friend in the dreary quatrieme of the\r\ntall house with the dirty stone stairs. It was a doleful empty room,\r\nwhere, with a mannish-looking dressing-gown and a torn lace scarf tied\r\nhood-fashion over her scanty hair, Mrs. Houghton sat over a pan of\r\ncharcoal oppressive to Alice\'s English lungs.\r\n\r\n\'Come again!\' she cried.  \'Well, I really shall begin to think that\r\nangels and ministers of grace exist off the stage!  You pretty thing!\r\nLet me look at you.  Where did you get that delicious little bonnet?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, it is perfectly plain!\'\r\n\r\n\'So it is!  \'Tis only the face that is in it.  Now if some folks put\r\nthis on--sister Anne, for example, what dowdies they would be.  Poor\r\nold Anne, you must know she had a turn for finery, only she never knew\r\nhow to gratify it.  To see the contortions of her crinolines was the\r\ndelight of all the grammar school.  It was a regular comedy for them to\r\nsee her get into our pew edgeways, and once unconsciously she carried\r\noff a gentleman\'s hat on her train.\'\r\n\r\nSo she went on talking, coughing at intervals, and generally using a\r\nhalf-mocking tone, as if defying the tenderness that awoke in spite of\r\nher, but always of her original home, and especially of her sister.\r\nAlice ventured to ask whether they often heard from one another.\r\n\r\n\'Good soul, she always writes at Christmas and on my birthday.  I know\r\nas well as possible that I shall find a letter poste restante wherever\r\nshe heard of me last, and that she hasn\'t done--I\'m ashamed to say for\r\nhow long--really, I think not since I let her know that I couldn\'t\r\nstand Ivy Lodge, Dockforth, at any price, when she wrote to Monaco on\r\nseeing poor Houghton\'s death in the paper.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of rambling talk of this kind, to which Alice\r\nlistened tenderly and compassionately, making no attempt at persuasion,\r\nonly doing what was possible for the poor lady\'s comfort. She had\r\nprocured on her way some fruit and jelly, and some good English tea, at\r\nwhich Mrs. Houghton laughed, saying, \'Time was, I called it cat-lap!\r\nSomehow it will seem the elixir of life now, redolent, even milkless,\r\nof the days when we were young.\'\r\n\r\nThen she revealed something of her long, suffering, almost ghastly\r\nnights, and Alice gently told how her old friend, Mrs. Nugent, suffered\r\nfrom sleeplessness, and kept a store of soothing psalms and hymns in\r\nher memory.  There was a little laugh.  \'That\'s for you good folk.  I\r\nhaven\'t such a thing about me!  Come, Par exemple!\' and Alice repeated\r\nthe first thing she could remember, the verse beginning \'God, who\r\nmadest earth and heaven.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s one of your charms, is it?  Well, it would not be too much for\r\nme if my poor old memory would hold it.  Say it again.\'\r\n\r\nAlice generally had about her a tiny prayer-book with \'Hymns, Ancient\r\nand Modern,\' attached.  It had been a gift from Mary Nugent, and she\r\nwas fond of it, but the opportunity was not to be lost, and she took it\r\nout, saying she would bring a larger one and reclaim it.  And, as she\r\nwas finally taking leave, she said with a throbbing heart, \'Do you know\r\nthat you have betrayed your sister\'s address?  I shall write to her\r\nnow.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you do--!\' cried Mrs. Houghton, in a tone like threatening\r\ndeprecation, but with a little of her strange banter in it besides.\r\nAlice\'s mind had been made up to do the thing, and she had not felt it\r\nhonest not to give due warning of her intentions.  Even now she was not\r\ncertain of the lady\'s surname, but she trusted to her husband\'s\r\nknowledge of Mrs. Houghton\'s previous history; and not in vain.  Mr.\r\nEgremont amused himself with a little ridicule at his wife\'s quixotry,\r\nand demanded whether Flossy Houghton was a promising convert; but\r\nconfessed himself very glad that the poor thing should be off their\r\nhands, declaring that it was quite time her own people looked after\r\nher, and happily he recollected her maiden name.  So the letter was\r\nwritten, after numerous attempts at expressing it suitably, explaining\r\nMrs. Houghton\'s illness and the yearnings she was too proud and ashamed\r\nto express to her sister, and was answered at once by a few short words\r\nof earnest gratitude, and an assurance that Miss Reade was preparing to\r\nstart at once.  Could Mrs. Egremont meet her and prepare her sister?\r\n\r\nTo Alice\'s disappointment this could not be.  Mr. Egremont had invited\r\nsome friends to the villa, and would not spare her.  She could only\r\nsend a note, assuring Miss Reade that she believed that preparation\r\nwould do more harm than good, and she waited and watched anxiously.  A\r\ncard came by the post in Mrs. Houghton\'s scrawled writing.  \'Naughty\r\nlittle wretch!\' was all it said, but thence she gathered hope.\r\n\r\nThe spring was advancing, and Mr. Egremont was in haste to be gone, but\r\nAlice obtained one more run to Mentone, and once more climbed up the\r\ndark and dirty stairs to the room, where the well-known voice answered\r\nher tap, \'Come in!  Ah, there she is, the wicked little angel!\'\r\n\r\nA substantial little roly-poly business-like little woman hurried\r\nforward with tearful eyes and outstretched hands.  \'Oh, Mrs. Egremont!\r\ncan I ever thank you enough?\'\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t, Anne, so don\'t try.  It will be a relief to all parties,\'\r\ninterposed Mrs. Houghton.  \'Sentiment is not permitted here.\'\r\n\r\nNevertheless she hugged Alice almost convulsively.  She was sitting in\r\na comfortable arm-chair, one about which Mrs. Egremont knew something,\r\nand the whole aspect of the room had changed indescribably for the\r\nbetter, as much indeed as Mrs. Houghton\'s own personal array, which had\r\nno longer the desolate neglected look of old.\r\n\r\nA little stool was close to her chair, as if the two sisters could not\r\nbear to be far apart, and the look of love and content in their eyes as\r\nthey turned to one another was perfect joy to Alice.  She had no longer\r\nany doubt that Anne Reade, who had found the wanderer yet a great way\r\noff, would yet bring her back to the home, spiritually if not outwardly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Houghton spoke, of better rooms when the winter visitors had fled,\r\nAnne spoke of her being able to return to Dockforth.  Whether that\r\nwould ever be seemed entirely doubtful to Alice\'s eyes, especially as\r\nthe patient\'s inclination was evidently otherwise. There was nothing to\r\nbe done but to leave the sisters together, obtaining Miss Reade\'s ready\r\npromise to write, and putting into her hands a sum of money which could\r\nbe sincerely called \'only a debt of gratitude from my husband and me,\'\r\nand which would smooth the way either to remaining or returning to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nNor was there any return.  Ere many weeks had passed Mrs. Egremont\r\nheard from Miss Reade how a fresh cold had made it impossible to move,\r\nand summer heat had brought on low fever, which had destroyed the\r\nfeeble strength, but not till \'childhood\'s star\' had again arisen, and\r\na deeply and truly repentant woman had passed away, saved, as it\r\nseemed, through that one effort on behalf of the young girl whose\r\ninnocence she had protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE VORTEX.\r\n\r\n  \'With one black shadow at her feet.\'--TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rebuffs that society had bestowed on his wife and daughter at Nice\r\nhad rendered Mr. Egremont the more determined on producing them in\r\nLondon and establishing their position.  He secured a furnished house\r\nin Westburnia before leaving Nice, and, travelling leisurely home\r\nwithout visiting Bridgefield, he took possession the second week in May.\r\n\r\nThere had not been much correspondence with the Rectory, and on the\r\nfirst forenoon, as Mrs. Egremont and Nuttie were trying to enliven the\r\ndrawing-room with the flowers sent up to meet them, they were surprised\r\nby the entrance of Blanche, full of kisses and welcomes.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! didn\'t you know?  I\'m with the Kirkaldys just round the corner.\r\nAunt Margaret has undertaken to do the part of a noble aunt by me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you are here for the season?  And May?\'\r\n\r\n\'May wouldn\'t come, except just for a week to see the pictures, and lay\r\nin a stock of talk.  She\'s grown more parochial than ever, and we\r\nbelieve it is all Hugh Condamine.  Oh! I forgot you were gone before we\r\ncame home last autumn.  He is mamma\'s nephew, you know, and was\r\nordained last year to the curacy of the next parish to his father\'s\r\nplace.  If the Edwardses only would take themselves off, we would have\r\nhim at home, and then we should have flowers on the altar, and all\r\nsorts of jolly things.  Papa would stand ever so much more from him\r\nthan from the old Edwardses.\'\r\n\r\n\'But is he engaged to May, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, no, not exactly.  I believe he does not think it right till he\r\nhas done preparing for priest\'s orders.  He\'s ever so strict, you know,\r\nand he hasn\'t got much either; but he means it.  Lucy, his sister, you\r\nknow, told me all about it, and that altogether the elders had settled\r\nit was better for both that he should attend to his preparation, and\r\nMay should not bind herself, though they really understand one another,\r\nand so she won\'t come to London.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that\'s very good of her!\' cried Nuttie; \'but why won\'t they let\r\nthem settle their minds and be engaged?\'\r\n\r\n\'People are always tiresome,\' said Blanche; \'and I do believe the\r\nliving is at the bottom of it, at least Lucy thought so.  I mean\r\neverybody wants to wait--all the old ones, I mean--not Hugh or May, of\r\ncourse--to know whether Mark will stick to the umbrellas, or turn back\r\nand be a clergyman, because, then, of course, he would have the living;\r\nand if he doesn\'t, they want to be certain whether Uncle Alwyn, or you,\r\nNuttie, would promise it to Hugh if he married May!\'\r\n\r\n\'Me!\' exclaimed Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'My dear, I don\'t like to hear you talk of such things,\' said Mrs.\r\nEgremont gently.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, I know--it\'s all very dreadful.  I was only telling you what\r\nis in the old people\'s heads, and what would settle it, and make it all\r\nright with them.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how is Mark?  Is Miss Ruthven in London?\' asked Mrs. Egremont,\r\nglad to turn away the conversation from the contingencies of which\r\nBlanche spoke with the hardness of youth, as yet not realising sorrow.\r\n\r\n\'I daresay you know nearly as much of Mark as we do, now the Kirkaldys\r\nare up here.  All his letters go to Lescombe.  Oh no, Annaple is not in\r\nLondon.  The Delmars can\'t afford it, you know, though I believe my\r\nlady would have made a stretch if Annaple hadn\'t been bespoke--but now\r\nshe reserves herself for Muriel.\'\r\n\r\nAlice looked with some discomfort at the soft fair-haired creature who\r\nwas uttering all this worldly jargon in a tone that would have been\r\nflippant if it had not been so childish.  She asked if Lord. Ronnisglen\r\nhad written.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, long ago.  Lady Delmar had tried to make him nasty about it,\r\nbut he wouldn\'t be, so that\'s all right; and Mark seems to get on very\r\nwell, though it must be horridly dull for him now the Kirkaldys are\r\naway, and he can\'t spend all his Sundays at Monks Horton.\'\r\n\r\n\'He will get more into the spirit of the place,\' said Nuttie, whereat\r\nBlanche shrugged her shoulders a little, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve got out of it at any rate, Nuttie!\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope not!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, then, the look of it!  I never saw any one so improved!  Isn\'t\r\nshe, Aunt Alice?  She\'s grown, I declare!  Yes\'--measuring herself\r\nagainst her cousin--\'I was a leetle bit taller when you came, and now\r\nyou\'ve got above me! and what a duck of a way of doing your hair! You\r\nmust show me!  I must tell May there\'s no fear of your being taken for\r\none another now; Aunt Margaret will be quite surprised.\'\r\n\r\nIt was true that Ursula had developed a good deal during the last year,\r\nand, under the experienced hands of Martin, had lost her schoolgirl\r\nair, and turned into a young lady capable of becoming the Paris outfit\r\nwhich her father had enjoined.  Without positive beauty, she was a\r\npleasing, intelligent, animated girl, with the reputation of being an\r\nheiress, with a romance in the background, and there was nothing to\r\nprevent her from being a success.  The family connections, with Lady\r\nKirkaldy to set the example, had determined on giving full support to\r\nMrs. Egremont, and, as of course every one liked to look at so lovely a\r\nface, the way of both was smoothed in a manner that delighted her\r\nhusband when they encountered any of those who had looked coldly on her\r\nat Nice.\r\n\r\nHe would have had her presented, but her own reluctance and the united\r\ncounsels of Lady Kirkaldy and the Canoness prevailed on him to drop the\r\nidea; and then there was a fight with Ursula, who declared that she\r\nwould not go to court if her mother did not; but she was overruled at\r\nlast by that mother\'s tears at her defiance; and let herself be\r\npresented, together with Blanche, by Lady Kirkaldy.\r\n\r\nTo Ursula it was altogether a strange time, full of the same kind of\r\nreckless swing and sense of intoxication that had possessed her at\r\nBridgefield.  Not that there was an excessive amount of actual gaiety.\r\nHot rooms and late hours were soon found not to agree with Mrs.\r\nEgremont.  She looked faded and languid after evening parties; and, as\r\nher husband really cared more to have her ready to wait upon him and\r\namuse him than for anything else, he did not insist on her going out\r\nmore than might be needful to establish her position, or when it suited\r\nhim to show her off.  The other purposes were quite as well served by\r\nletting Ursula go out with Lady Kirkaldy, who was warmly interested in\r\nmother and daughter, glad of a companion for Blanche, and still more\r\nglad of a companion for herself.  For she was not slow to discover that\r\nexhibitions, which were merely fashionable gapeseed to her niece, were\r\nto Nuttie real delights, viewed intelligently, and eliciting comments\r\nand questions that Lady Kirkaldy and even her husband enjoyed in their\r\nfresh interest, but which were unendurable weariness to Blanche, unless\r\nshe had some one to chatter with.  Lectures and lessons, which the aunt\r\nhoped to render palatable by their being shared by the two cousins,\r\nonly served to show the difference between a trained and eager, and an\r\nuntrained and idle, nature.  With the foreign society to be met at Lord\r\nKirkaldy\'s, Blanche was less at a loss than her brother, and could get\r\non by the help of nods and becks and wreathed smiles; but Nuttie, fresh\r\nfrom her winter abroad, could really talk, and was often in request as\r\na useful person to help in entertaining.  She thus saw some of the\r\nchoicest society in London, and, in addition, had as much of the\r\nyouthful gaiety as Lady Kirkaldy thought wholesome for the two girls.\r\nAlso there were those ecclesiastical delights and privileges which had\r\nbeen heard of at Micklethwayte, and were within reach, greatly enjoyed\r\nby Mrs. Egremont whenever she could share them, though her daughter\r\nchafed at her treating all except the chief service on Sunday as more\r\nindulgence than duty.\r\n\r\nNuttie was strong, with that spring of energy which unbroken health and\r\na quiet life lays up, and, in her own phrase, she went in for\r\neverything, from early services to late balls, thinking all right\r\nbecause it was seldom that her day did not begin with matins or\r\nCelebration, and because she was not taken to more than two balls a\r\nweek, and conversed at times with superior people, or looked at those\r\nwith world-famed names.  Possibly the whirl was greater than if it had\r\nbeen mere gaiety, for then the brain would not have participated in it.\r\nChurch functions, with the scurry to go at all, or to obtain a seat,\r\nfine music, grand sermons, religious meetings, entertainments for the\r\npoor, lectures, lessons, exhibitions, rides, drives, kettle-drums,\r\ngarden-parties, concerts, theatres, operas, balls, chattering,\r\nlaughing, discussing, reading up current subjects, enjoying attention,\r\nexcitement as to what should be done and how,--one thing drove out\r\nanother in perpetual succession, and the one thing she never did or\r\ncould do was to sit still and think!  Rest was simply dreamless sleep,\r\ngenerally under the spell of a strong will to wake at the appointed\r\nhour for church.  The short intervals of being alone with her mother\r\nwere spent in pouring out histories of her doings, which were received\r\nwith a sympathy that doubled their pleasure, excepting when Nuttie\r\nthought proper to grumble and scold at her mother\'s not coming to some\r\nChurch festival at an hour when she thought Mr. Egremont might want her.\r\n\r\nOf him Nuttie saw very little.  He did not want her, and cared little\r\nwhat she did, as long as she was under the wing of Lady Kirkaldy, whose\r\npatronage was a triumphant refutation of all doubts.  He went his own\r\nway, and had his own club, his own associates, and, with his wife\r\nalways at his beck and call, troubled himself very little about\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nAlice spent a good deal of time alone, chiefly in waiting his pleasure;\r\nbut she had her own quiet occupations, her books, her needlework, her\r\nhousekeeping, and letter-writing, and was peacefully happy as long as\r\nshe did not displease Nuttie.  There were no collisions between father\r\nand daughter, and the household arrangements satisfied that fastidious\r\ntaste.  She was proud of Ursula\'s successes, but very thankful not to\r\nbe dragged out to share them, though she was much less shy, and more\r\nable on occasion to take her place.\r\n\r\nOne pain she had.  Good old Mrs. Nugent was rapidly decaying, and she\r\nshared with all her loving heart in the grief this was to Mary and to\r\nMiss Headworth, and longed to help them in their nursing.  She would\r\nnot grieve Nuttie by dwelling constantly on the bad accounts, and the\r\ngirl hardly attended to them in the tumult of occupations; and so at\r\nlast, when the final tidings came in the second week in July, they were\r\nan absolute shock to Nuttie, and affected her as the first grief\r\nsometimes does.  Mrs. Nugent was really the first person of her own\r\nintimate knowledge who had died, and in the excited state in which she\r\nwas, the idea of the contrast between her own occupations and Mary\'s\r\nwas so dreadful to her that she wept most bitterly, with the sobs of\r\nchildhood, such as she really did not know how to restrain.\r\n\r\nIt was an unfortunate day, for it was one of the few on which Mr.\r\nEgremont wanted to take out his ladies.  There was to be a great\r\ngarden-party at Richmond, given by one of his former set, who had\r\nlately whitewashed himself by marrying a very fast and fashionable\r\nlady.  Nuttie had heard strong opinions on the subject at Lord\r\nKirkaldy\'s; but her father was quite elated at being in a position to\r\ncountenance his old friends.  Alice, in the midst of her sorrow,\r\nrecollected this with consternation.\r\n\r\n\'My dear, my dear, hush!  You must stop yourself!  Remember we have to\r\ngo out.\'\r\n\r\n\'Go--out,\' cried Nuttie, her sobs arrested by very horror.  \'You\r\nwouldn\'t go--!\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid your father would be very much vexed--\'\r\n\r\n\'Let him!  It is a horrid wicked place to go to at all; and now--when\r\ndear, dear old Mrs. Nugent is lying there--and--\'\r\n\r\nThe crying grew violent again, and in the midst in walked Mr. Egremont\r\nwith an astonished \'What is all this?\'\r\n\r\n\'We have lost one of our dear kind old friends at Micklethwayte,\' said\r\nAlice, going towards him; \'dear old Mrs. Nugent,\' and she lifted up her\r\ntear-stained face, which he caressed a little and said, \'Poor old\r\nbody;\' but then, at a sob, \'Can\'t you stop Ursula from making such a\r\nrow and disfiguring herself?  You must pick up your looks, Edda, for I\r\nmean you to make a sensation at Jerningham\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Alwyn, if you could let us stay at home!  Mrs. Nugent was so good\r\nto us, and it does seem unkind--\' The tears were in her eyes again.\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense!\' he said impatiently.  \'I promised Jerningham, and it is\r\nabsurd to have you shutting yourself up for every old woman at\r\nMicklethwayte.\'\r\n\r\nThereupon Ursula wiped away her tears, and stood up wrathful before\r\nhim.  \'I am not going,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, indeed!\' he returned in a tone that made her still more angry.\r\n\'Hein\'! a French ejaculation which he had the habit of uttering in a\r\nmost exasperating manner.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' she said.  \'It is scarcely a place to which we even ought to be\r\nasked to go, and certainly not when--\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you hear that, Mrs. Egremont?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Nuttie, Nuttie, dear!\' she implored; \'don\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, mother,\' said Nuttie, with flashing eyes; \'if you care so little\r\nfor your best friends as to let yourself be dragged out among all sorts\r\nof gay, wicked people when your dear friend is lying dead, I\'m sure I\r\nshan\'t go with you.\'\r\n\r\nHer father laughed a little.  \'A pretty figure you are, to make a\r\nfavour of accompanying us!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, go away, go away, Nuttie,\' entreated her mother.  \'You don\'t know\r\nwhat you are saying.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do know,\' said Nuttie, exasperated perhaps by the contrast in the\r\nmirror opposite between her own swelled, disfigured face, and the soft\r\ntender one of her mother with the liquid eyes.  \'I know how much you\r\ncare for the dear friends who took care of us when we were forsaken!\'\r\n\r\nAnd with this shaft she marched out of the room, while her father again\r\nlaughed, and said, \'Have they been training her for the tragic stage?\r\nNever mind, Edda, the little vixen will come to her senses upstairs,\r\nand be begging to go.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think she will,\' said Alice sadly; \'she is not that sort of\r\nstuff, and she was very fond of Mrs. Nugent.  Oh, Alwyn! if you could\r\nlet us off.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not after that explosion, certainly,\' he said.  \'Besides, I promised\r\nJerningham, and such an excuse would never hold water.  She is not even\r\na relation.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, but she was very good to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'The more reason why you should not stay at home and be hipped. Never\r\nmind that silly girl.  She will be all right by and by.\'\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, she did not come down to luncheon, and when, about an\r\nhour later, Alice, after writing a few tender loving words to the\r\nmourners, went up to her daughter\'s room, it was to find a limp and\r\ndeplorable figure lying across the bed, and to be greeted with a fresh\r\noutburst of sobs and inarticulate exclamations.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Nuttie, dear, this will not do!  It is not right.  Dear good Mrs.\r\nNugent herself would tell you that this is not the way any one so good\r\nand so suffering should be grieved for.  Think--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I know all that!\' cried Nuttie, impatiently; \'but she--she was the\r\ndearest--and nobody cares for her but me.  Not even you--\'\r\n\r\nAgain Alice tried to debate the point, and urge on her the duties of\r\nmoderation, self-control, and obedience, but the poor gentle mother was\r\nat a great disadvantage.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, she respected and almost envied her daughter\'s\r\nresistance, and really did not know whether it was timidity or\r\nprinciple that made it her instinct to act otherwise; in the next,\r\nUrsula could always talk her down; and, in the third, she was, and\r\ngreatly she reproached herself for that same, in great dread of setting\r\nherself off into tears that might become hysterical if she once gave\r\nway to them.  And what would be her husband\'s feelings if she too\r\ncollapsed and became unpresentable.\r\n\r\nSo, having once convinced herself that even if Nuttie had been a\r\nconsenting party, no amount of cold water and eau-de-cologne would\r\nbring those bloodshot eyes, swollen lids, and mottled cheeks to be fit\r\nto be seen, she fled as fast as possible from the gasps of barbed\r\nreproaches which put her own composure in peril, and dressed with the\r\nheaviest of hearts, coupled with the utmost solicitude to look her\r\nbest.  If she had not thought it absolutely wrong, she would even have\r\nfollowed Martin\'s suggestion, and put on a soupcon of rouge; but by the\r\ntime she was summoned to the carriage the feverishness of her effort at\r\nself-control had done the work, and her husband had paid her the\r\ncompliment of observing that she looked pretty enough for two.\r\n\r\nNuttie heard them drive off, with a burst of fresh misery of\r\nindignation against her mother--now as a slave and a victim--now as\r\nforgetting her old home.  It was chiefly in mutterings; she had pretty\r\nwell used up her tears, for, unconsciously perhaps, she had worked them\r\nup as a defensive weapon against being carried to the party; and now\r\nthat the danger was over, her head throbbed, her eyes burnt, and her\r\nthroat ached too much for her to wish to cry any more. She had not felt\r\nphysically like this, since the day, seven years ago, when she and\r\nMildred Sharpe had been found suspiciously toying with the key of the\r\narithmetic, and had been debarred from trying for the prize.  Then she\r\nfelt debased and guilty; now she felt, or ought to feel, like a heroine\r\nmaintaining the right.\r\n\r\nShe got up and set herself to rights as well as she could.  Martin, who\r\nhad been allowed to know that she had lost an old friend, petted and\r\npitied her, and brought her a substantial meal with her tea, after\r\nwhich she set out to evensong at the church at the end of the square,\r\nwell veiled under a shady hat, and with a conviction that something\r\nought to happen.\r\n\r\nNothing did, however, happen; she met no one whom she knew, the psalms\r\nwere not particularly appropriate, and her attention wandered away to\r\nthe scene at home.  She did not come back, as she was sure she ought to\r\nhave done, soothed, exhilarated, and refreshed, but rather in a rasped\r\nstate of mind, and a conscience making a vehement struggle to believe\r\nitself in the right--a matter in which she thoroughly succeeded.\r\n\r\nShe wrote a long letter to Mary Nugent, and shed some softer tears over\r\nit, then she built a few castles on her future escape from the power of\r\nher father; and then she picked up Reata, and became absorbed in it,\r\nregretting only the weakness of her eyes, and the darkening of the\r\nsummer evening.\r\n\r\nShe was still reading when the others came home.  Her mother kissed\r\nher, but looked so languid and tired-out that Nuttie was shocked, and\r\nMartin declared that she ought not to go down to dinner.\r\n\r\nA tete-a-tete dinner between father and daughter was too dreadful to\r\nAlice\'s imagination to be permitted, so she dressed and went down,\r\nlooking like a ghost.  Mr. Egremont scowled at Nuttie, Nuttie scowled\r\nat him, each considering it the fault of the other, and when at last it\r\nwas over, Alice gave up the struggle, and went off to bed, leaving a\r\ncontrite message that her headache would be better to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\'All your accursed folly and obstinacy,\' observed Mr. Egremont, when\r\nNuttie, with a tone of monition gave him the message.\r\n\r\n\'I should call it the consequence of being dragged out with a sore\r\nheart,\' returned Nuttie--a little speech she had prepared ever since\r\nshe had seen how knocked up her mother was.\r\n\r\n\'Then I should recommend keeping your ideas to yourself,\' he answered,\r\nlooking at her in his annihilating manner.\r\n\r\nShe was put down. She thought afterwards of a hundred things that she\r\ncould have said to him, but she was crushed for the present, and when\r\nhe went out she could only betake herself to Reata, and forget all\r\nabout it as much as she could.\r\n\r\nWhen she went upstairs, at the end of the third volume, Martin was on\r\nthe watch, and would not let her go into the room.\r\n\r\n\'I have been at hand, ma\'am, without her guessing it, and I am happy to\r\nsay her tears has had a free course when she was in bed.  Yes, ma\'am,\r\nsuppressed grief is always dangerous.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Egremont was still prostrate with fatigue and headache the next\r\nday, and Nuttie had all the quiet luxuriating in reminiscences she\r\ndesired.  Her father was vexed and angry, and kept out of the way, but\r\nit must be confessed that Nuttie\'s spirits had so much risen by the\r\nafternoon that it was a sore concession to consistency when she found\r\nherself not expected at Blanche\'s last little afternoon dance at Lady\r\nKirkaldy\'s!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nWOLF.\r\n\r\n  \'If I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against\r\n  an honest man, I have but very little credit with your Worship.\'\r\n                                               --II. King Henry IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother cause besides Ursula\'s recalcitrance and her mother\'s ailment\r\ncontributed to disturb Mr. Egremont, and bring him home.  His agent, by\r\nname Bulfinch, a solicitor at Redcastle, came to him with irrefragable\r\nproofs of gross peculation on the part of the bailiff who managed the\r\nhome farm which supplied the house and stables, and showed him that it\r\nwas necessary to make a thorough investigation and change of system.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, Mr. Egremont greatly preferred being moderately\r\ncheated to exerting himself to investigate, but this was going beyond\r\nmoderation, and the explosion had been too public to be passed over. So\r\nhe came home and sat by, while his wife and Mr. Bulfinch did the work\r\nfor him, and made it evident to him that the frauds had been of long\r\nstanding, and carried on with the connivance of the coachman, of\r\nGregorio,--who had before Mrs. Egremont\'s arrival acted as house\r\nsteward,--and of the former cook.  Indeed, it was the housekeeper whom\r\nMrs. Egremont had left in charge, whose refusal to connive had brought\r\nabout the discovery.\r\n\r\nGregorio\'s share in all was sufficiently evident, and Alice\'s heart\r\nleapt with hope.  Her husband would be wholly her own if his evil\r\ngenius were once departed, but Mr. Egremont would not see it.  He had\r\nno objection to sacrifice the coachman and all his underlings, with the\r\nbailiff and his entire family, and felt none of the pity that Alice had\r\nfor the pretty, silly, half-educated daughters; but as to the\r\nvalet--Pooh! pooh! the poor fellow had been out of the way all this\r\ntime--whatever he had done had been in the dark, ages long ago, before\r\nBridgefield knew its mistress; he was a foreigner, and that was enough\r\nto prevent him from forgathering with the English.  It was all their\r\nEnglish prejudice.\r\n\r\n\'I can show you facts and figures, sir,\' said Mr. Bulfinch.\r\n\r\n\'I daresay, a year or more old.  Why, I was an unprotected carcase\r\nthen--a mere prey--the fellow only did after his kind.\'\r\n\r\nAlice held her tongue then, but made an effort in private.  \'Indeed, I\r\ndon\'t think you know; I am afraid Gregorio is not altered.  I found him\r\nout in his charges about the wine, and the servants\' wages at Nice,\r\nonly you wouldn\'t listen.\'\r\n\r\n\'His little perquisites, my dear child!  Come, nonsense, these foreign\r\nfellows don\'t pretend to have the morals you ascribe to the native\r\nflunkey--generally without foundation either--they are much of a\r\nmuchness as to that; but your Frenchman or Italian does it more neatly,\r\nand is a dozen times better servant than the other is.\'\r\n\r\n\'But--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, ay!  I know you don\'t like him.  But he knows his manners to you,\r\nI hope?\' said Mr. Egremont, with a suddenness that made her wish she\r\ncould truthfully say he did not.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he always is--is respectful, but somehow I see it is under\r\nprotest.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Egremont laughed.  \'Rivals--yes, I see; why, you don\'t consider the\r\nsore trial of having a full-grown mistress turned in upon him! Look\r\nhere, you keep the keys already, but the new fellow at the farm and all\r\nthe rest of them shall account to you for everything--Gregorio and all.\r\nWon\'t that satisfy you?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis not only the money, but I think Gregorio is a bad--not a\r\ngood--man.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ho, ho! she wants to advertise for a pious footman and coachman! eh?\r\nNo, I thank you, my dear Edda, I agree with--who was it who said,\r\n"Volez moi, mais sans m\'ennuyer."\'\r\n\r\nThe Rectory likewise had hoped for Gregorio\'s dismissal, and there were\r\ngrave looks when Alice had to confess that nothing would move her\r\nhusband against him.  The Canon even lashed himself up to say, \'I tell\r\nyou how it is, Alwyn, you\'ll never do any good with your household,\r\nwhile you keep that fellow.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not aware what description of good you expect me to do with it,\r\nWill,\' coolly answered the elder brother in a disconcerting tone.\r\n\r\nPoor Alice, on her side, thought of the Little Master, and then\r\nwondered if it was uncharitable to do so.  For she knew it had become\r\nwar to the knife with Gregorio!  Whether his master told him, or\r\nwhether it were his own evil conscience, or the wonderful intuition of\r\nservants, he certainly knew of the pressure for his dismissal, and he\r\nvisited it on her as much as he durst.\r\n\r\nOutwardly deferential, he could thwart and annoy her in a hundred ways,\r\nfrom making love to the housemaids to making evil suggestions to his\r\nmaster, yet never giving her any overt cause of complaint.  He could\r\nworry and sting her under the politest exterior, and he knew very well\r\nthat the most effectual form of annoyance was the persuading his master\r\nthat any discomfort or lassitude was to be removed by some form of\r\nnarcotic.  This would have the further advantage of stupefying Mr.\r\nEgremont, and making him more ready to lapse under the old influence;\r\nwhile the duration and strength of the new one was already a surprise\r\nto Gregorio.\r\n\r\nBut there was no doubt that Mrs. Egremont had profited by her year of\r\ntraining.  She looked tired, and less youthful and pretty, but she had\r\ngained in grace and importance as well as in style, and was much more\r\nreally the mistress of Bridgefield.  Her shyness had passed away, and\r\nshe knew now to take her place in society, though still she was\r\nsomewhat silent.  And her husband depended upon her entirely for all\r\nhis correspondence, for much of his occupation and amusement, and even\r\nfor the regulation of his affairs.  In the household, Gregorio was\r\nlittle more than his personal attendant, and she had the general\r\nmanagement, even of the other men-servants.  The Canoness might well\r\nsay it had turned out better than she expected.\r\n\r\nAnd Nuttie had become more womanly, and had acquired the indefinable\r\npolish given by a London season.  She had learnt the art of\r\nconversation, and could make herself agreeable to her uncle, or to any\r\none else who came in her way.  Even May allowed that she had something\r\nin her, and cultivated her more than before; but, on the other hand,\r\neven the Rectory could perceive that there was now an absolute\r\nalienation between her and her father, and what might before have been\r\nfear had become dislike.  If she had to refer to him, especially if her\r\nplans for herself or her mother were crossed, there was always a tone\r\nof bitterness or of sarcasm about her; and her greater boldness and\r\nfreedom of speech would occasionally manifest itself towards him.  This\r\nwas not indeed often, since not only did his cool contempt make her\r\ncome off the worst in the encounters, but the extreme distress they\r\ngave to her mother made her refrain whenever her temper, or what she\r\nthought her conscience, would let her; but still there was always a\r\ndanger which kept poor Alice on thorns whenever there was a possible\r\ndifference of schemes or opinions.\r\n\r\nMrs. William Egremont was seriously considering of representing to\r\nUrsula that her conduct was bad taste, bad policy, and, moreover, was\r\ndoing her mother\'s spirits and health serious harm; but it was a\r\ndelicate matter in which to meddle, and the good lady could not make up\r\nher mind how far to surrender her brother-in-law\'s character and allow\r\na partial justification to Ursula.  She was a cautious woman, and\r\nwaited and watched her opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of October Mr. and Mrs. Egremont were invited to a\r\ngreat shooting party at Sir James Jerningham\'s.  The invitation did not\r\ninclude Ursula.  Perhaps she had never dawned on their hostess\'s\r\nimagination; perhaps it was that Lady Jerningham was well known to\r\ndislike girls, or any one who might absorb young men\'s attention. At\r\nany rate the omission was a cause of thankfulness to the party\r\nconcerned, and she did not neglect to worry her mother by a protest\r\nagainst keeping such company as would be met at Waldicotes.\r\n\r\nAlice smiled a little faintly and said, \'I don\'t think it hurts me, my\r\ndear; I don\'t understand half of what they talk about, and they are\r\nalways kind to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think you ought to go among them or countenance them.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear child,\'--and the colour rose--\'I don\'t feel as if I had a\r\nright to set myself above any one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother!\'\r\n\r\n\'People might have said just the same of me.\'\r\n\r\n\'And whose fault was that?\' muttered Nuttie under her breath, but Mrs.\r\nEgremont would not hear.  She only pleaded, as perhaps mother ought not\r\nto have done with child.\r\n\r\n\'You know, Nuttie, it is not for my own pleasure, but your father\'s\r\neyesight makes him dislike to go anywhere without me now; and I really\r\nshould be uneasy about him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; he is all you care for,\' said Nuttie.  \'You sacrifice everything\r\nyou used to think essential, just to his will and pleasure.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Nuttie, I hope not; I don\'t think I do!\'\r\n\r\n\'If I thought it was doing him any good I should not so much mind,\'\r\nwent on the girl; \'but he is just the same, and I am always thinking of\r\n"As the husband is, the wife is--"\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush! hush!  You have no right to think in that way of your father. I\r\nwill not hear it.  I have let you say too much already, Nuttie.\' Then\r\nafter a pause she added, gently and wistfully, \'You have been better\r\ntaught, and are clearer headed than ever I was, my Nuttie, and it is\r\nquite right that you should hate what seems evil to you.  I can only go\r\non trying to do what seems my duty from day to day.  I know,\' she added\r\nwith rising tears, \'that the sin and folly of my younger days worked a\r\ndifficult position for us both; but we can only act according to our\r\nlights, and pray God to direct us; and please--please bear with me, my\r\ndear one, if the same course does not always seem right to us both.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie had never heard her say anything so fully showing that she\r\nrealised these difficulties, and, greatly touched, she asked pardon,\r\nkissed and caressed her mother.  There was a calm over them for the\r\nnext few days, and Nuttie actually refrained from bitter comments when\r\nher mother was not allowed to go to evensong on Sunday, on the plea of\r\nher being tired, but, as the girl believed, in order that she might\r\nread the newspapers aloud.\r\n\r\nShe knew that her silence was appreciated by the way her mother kissed\r\nher and called her a dear, good, considerate girl.\r\n\r\nOn Monday Mr. and Mrs. Egremont went away at what was a strangely early\r\nhour for the former, Nuttie spending her days at the Rectory.\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday Blanche went with her little sister and the governess on\r\na shopping expedition to Redcastle, and in relating her adventures on\r\nher return, she said, \'Oh, by the bye, I met Annaple in Park\'s shop!\'\r\n\r\n\'Full of Micklethwayte news, I suppose,\' said May.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, of course.  Did you know, Nuttie, that your aunt was ill?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed, I did not.  What was the matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'Bronchitis, I believe--brown titus, as Betty Butter calls it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bronchitis!  Oh dear! oh dear!  Are you quite sure, Blanche?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes!  I am quite certain Annaple said Mark told her that Miss\r\nHeadworth was laid up with bronchitis.\'\r\n\r\n\'And nobody has written to us all this week!\' sighed Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'I should think that a sign there could not be much in it,\' observed\r\nMay; \'it may be only a bad cold.\'\r\n\r\n\'But Aunt Ursel had bronchitis four years ago, and was very ill\r\nindeed,\' persisted Nuttie.  \'I\'m sure it is bronchitis, and that she\r\nwon\'t let Miss Mary write to us.\'\r\n\r\nShe was in much distress about it, though May privately told her that\r\nshe ought to know Blanche\'s way better than to trust implicitly to any\r\nof her reports; and her aunt said much the same thing in more general\r\nterms, even proposing that if she did not hear the next morning she\r\nshould go over to Lescombe to ascertain what Mark had really said.\r\n\r\nThis pacified her a little, but on her way home the alarm grew upon\r\nher, and, moreover, she recollected the opposition that she believed\r\nthat her father was certain to make to either her mother or herself\r\ngoing to nurse her aunt.  It flashed upon her that if she were to\r\nhasten to Micklethwayte on this alarm before there could be a\r\nprohibition, it would be no disobedience, and perfectly justifiable,\r\nnot to say noble.  Her parents were to return on Thursday evening, and\r\nshe made up her mind that, unless she were fully reassured as to Miss\r\nHeadworth\'s state, she would go off at once to Micklethwayte before any\r\none could gainsay her.  She had plenty of money, and she consulted the\r\ntime-table in the hall before going upstairs.  It only concerned the\r\nnearest line, but she calculated that if she caught the express, she\r\nshould reach her destination in time to write to her mother at\r\nWaldicotes, and prevent needless shocks.  Her eagerness for the plan\r\ngrew upon her, so that it seemed like liberation; she could hardly\r\nsleep for thinking of it, and certainly was not as much disappointed as\r\nshe believed herself when the post came in--a blank.\r\n\r\nMartin was away with her mistress, so Nuttie explained matters to the\r\nupper housemaid, who was very sympathetic, carried down her orders for\r\nthe carriage, procured for her both breakfast and provision for the\r\njourney, and packed her clothes.  Ursula would fain have been off\r\nbefore the Rectory was aware, but the two little girls came up with a\r\nmessage about the plans for the day, just as she was beginning an\r\nexplanatory note, and she entrusted to them the information that she\r\nwas so uneasy about Miss Headworth that she had decided on going to see\r\nfor herself.\r\n\r\nSo in dashed Adela and Rosalind to their mother\'s room full of\r\nexcitement with the news that Cousin Nuttie was gone off by the train,\r\nbecause her aunt was very ill indeed.\r\n\r\n\'Gone, Adela? are you sure?  Really gone?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, mamma!  The dogcart was coming round, and she said she wanted\r\nto catch the 10.05 train, and was very sorry she had not time to write\r\na note to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Was there a letter?  What had she heard?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, only that her aunt was so very ill!  She did not tell us--did she,\r\nRosie?\'\r\n\r\n\'There was something about being in time to write to Aunt Alice,\'\r\nsuggested Adela.\r\n\r\n\'I am very sorry about this.  I am afraid it will be a great shock to\r\nAlice,\' observed the mother, as she imparted the news at her husband\'s\r\ndressing-room door.\r\n\r\n\'Young girls are so precipitate!\' said the Canon.\r\n\r\n\'Your brother won\'t like it at all,\' the lady continued.\r\n\r\n\'Not he.  But after all, it is just as well that he was not asked. They\r\ndo owe that poor old lady a good deal, and Alwyn\'s not the man to see\r\nit.  I\'m not sorry the girl took the matter into her own hands, though\r\nI couldn\'t have advised it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Except that it will all fall on Alice.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is very fond of Alice.  She has done more with him than I ever\r\nthought possible.  Kept him respectable this whole year, and really it\r\ngrows on him.  He makes ever so much more of her now than when he first\r\nbrought her home--and no wonder.  No, no; he won\'t fall foul of her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps not; but it is just as bad, or worse, for her if he falls foul\r\nof her daughter.  Besides, she is very much attached to her aunt.  I\r\nwish I knew what the account was, or whether she knows anything about\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nURSULA\'S RECEPTION.\r\n\r\n  \'Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought.\'--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at half-past seven o\'clock that Ursula Egremont\'s cab stopped at\r\nSt. Ambrose\'s Road.  She had missed the express train, and had to come\r\non by a stopping one.  But here at last she was, with eyes even by\r\ngaslight full of loving recognition, a hand full of her cab-fare, a\r\nheart full of throbbing hope and fear, a voice full of anxiety, as she\r\ninquired of the astonished servant, \'Louisa, Louisa, how is Aunt\r\nUrsel!\' and, without awaiting the reply, she opened the adjoining door.\r\nThere sat, with their evening meal on the table, not only Mary Nugent,\r\nbut Miss Headworth herself.\r\n\r\nNuttie rushed at her, and there was an incoherency of exclamations, the\r\nfirst thing that made itself clear to the senses of the traveller\r\nbeing, \'Ill, my dear?  No such thing!  Only I had a bad cold, and Mary\r\nhere is only too careful of me.\'\r\n\r\n\'But Mark said you had bronchitis.\'\r\n\r\n\'What could have put that into his head?  He did not write it, surely?\'\r\n\r\n\'He wrote it to Annaple Ruthven, and she told Blanche.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' and Mary Nugent\'s tone was rather nettling.\r\n\r\n\'And then it was such a terrible time since we had heard anything,\'\r\nadded Nuttie, on the defensive.\r\n\r\n\'Did not your mother get my letter?\' said Miss Headworth.  \'I wrote to\r\nher at--what\'s the name of that place?  I hope I addressed it right.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but I was not there.  I didn\'t go with them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, yes, I remember.  Then did not she send you?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I came off this morning.  I heard this yesterday evening, and I\r\ndetermined that nothing should stop me if there was no news by the\r\npost.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear child!  But will your father not be displeased?\' said Miss\r\nHeadworth.\r\n\r\n\'He hasn\'t any right to object,\' cried Nuttie, with flashing eyes and a\r\nlook that made Miss Nugent anxious; but at the moment there could be\r\nlittle thought save of welcome to the warm-hearted girl.  Louisa was\r\nalready brewing fresh tea, and extemporising additions to the meal, and\r\nNuttie was explaining how she hoped to have arrived a couple of hours\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\n\'By the bye, I meant to have written to mother for her to have it\r\nto-morrow before leaving Waldicotes.  Is there time?\'\r\n\r\nNo, the pillar at hand was cleared at seven, and the regular\r\npost-office could not be reached in time; so they satisfied themselves\r\nwith the knowledge that Mrs. Egremont must have had Aunt Ursel\'s\r\ncheerful letter, and Mary recommended telegraphing to the Canon the\r\nfirst thing in the morning.  Then they gave themselves up to enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\'At any rate, I\'m here,\' said Nuttie, \'and I\'ll make the most of it.\'\r\n\r\nAnd her handsome furs were laid aside, and her boots taken off, and she\r\nresigned herself to absolute ease and luxury, while Mary poured out the\r\ntea, and her aunt heaped her plate with eggs and rashers \'such as one\r\ndoesn\'t get anywhere else,\' said Nuttie, declaring herself quite\r\nvoracious, while her aunt fondly admired her growth and improvement,\r\nand she inquired into the cold, not quite gone yet; and there were\r\nspeculations over what Mark could have got into his head. Mary\r\nremembered having met him coming to call, and having told him that she\r\nhad persuaded Miss Headworth to keep her bed because her colds were apt\r\nto be severe, and it was agreed to lay the exaggeration at the door of\r\nthe lovers and Blanche.  Miss Headworth laughed, and said she ought to\r\nbe flattered that an old woman\'s sore throat should be thought worthy\r\nof mention by a fine young gentleman like Mr. Mark.  \'A very good young\r\nman he is,\' she added.  \'You would never have thought how kind he is in\r\ncoming in here to tell me everything he hears about your dear mother,\r\nNuttie.\'\r\n\r\n\'He makes himself very useful while Mr. Dutton is away,\' added Mary,\r\n\'taking his young men\'s class and all.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! is Mr. Dutton away?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; he has had to be in London a great deal of late.  I am afraid he\r\nmay have to live there altogether.\'\r\n\r\n\'What a grievous pity!\'\r\n\r\n\'He won\'t be anywhere without doing good,\' said Miss Headworth, \'but I\r\nsometimes wish we had his cool good sense here.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how is Mr. Spyers,\' asked Nuttie.  She felt shy of asking for\r\nGerard Godfrey, or perhaps she thought she ought to be shy of his name,\r\nand kept hoping that it would come in naturally.\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Spyers is very well.  Very busy of course, and very much delighted\r\nwith your mother\'s gifts to the church.  All her own work, isn\'t it,\r\nNuttie?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; every bit.  She does lots of embroidery and work of all kinds\r\nwhen she is waiting for _him_ or sitting with him, and luckily it has\r\nnever occurred to him to ask what it is for.\'\r\n\r\nThe two ladies knew well what was meant by him, but they would not\r\npursue the subject, and proceeded to put Nuttie au courant with St.\r\nAmbrose affairs--how last year\'s mission had produced apparently an\r\nimmense effect in the town, and how the improvement had been ebbing\r\never since, but had left various individual gains, and stirred up more\r\nthan one good person who had hitherto thought it enough to save one\'s\r\nown soul and let other people alone; how Mr. Spyers was endeavouring to\r\nbind people together in a guild; how a violent gust of temperance\r\norators had come down upon the place, and altogether fascinated and\r\ncarried away Gerard Godfrey.\r\n\r\nThere was his name at last, and Nuttie was rather gratified to feel\r\nherself blushing as she asked, \'Ah! poor Gerard--how is he?\'\r\n\r\n\'As good and sincere as ever,\' said Miss Nugent, \'but not much wiser.\r\nHe is so excitable and vehement.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Miss Headworth.  \'I don\'t understand the kind of thing. In\r\nmy time a steady young clerk used to be contented after hours with\r\nplaying at cricket in the summer, or learning the flute in the\r\nwinter--and a great nuisance it was sometimes, but now Gerard must get\r\nhimself made a sort of half clergyman.\'\r\n\r\n\'A reader,\' suggested Mary.\r\n\r\n\'Minor orders.  Oh, how delightful!\' cried Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'People, don\'t half understand it,\' added Miss Headworth.  \'Mrs.\r\nJeffreys will have it that he is no better than a Jesuit, and really I\r\ndid not know what to say, for he talked, to me by the hour about his\r\nbeing an external brother to something.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not to the Jesuits, certainly,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I told her that; but she thinks all monks are Jesuits, you know,\r\nand that all brothers are monks; and he does wear his cassock--his\r\nchoir cassock, I mean--when he has his service in the iron room at the\r\nsandpits.  And now he has taken up temperance, and flies about giving\r\nthe pledge, and wanting one to wear bits of blue ribbon.  I told him I\r\nnever did take, and never had taken, more than a little hot wine and\r\nwater when I had a cold, and I couldn\'t see what good it would do to\r\nGeorge Jenkins and the poor fellows at the Spread Eagle if I took ever\r\nso many vows.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s a regular blue-ribbon fever set in,\' said Miss Nugent. \'Gerard\r\ntold me I was supporting the cause of intemperance yesterday because I\r\nwas so wicked as to carry the rest of your bottle of port, Miss\r\nHeadworth, to poor Anne Crake.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well! he is a dear boy, and youth wouldn\'t be youth if it were not\r\nsometimes rather foolish,\' said Miss Headworth, \'and it is better it\r\nshould be for good than evil.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eager in a cause and not for selfishness,\' said Mary.  \'Poor Gerard, I\r\nwonder where he will be safely landed!\'\r\n\r\nSo did Nuttie, who had a secret flattering faith in being the cause of\r\nall the poor young fellow\'s aberrations, and was conscious of having\r\nbegun the second volume of her life\'s novel.  She went to bed in the\r\nelated frame of mind proper to a heroine.  There was a shade over all\r\nin the absence of dear old Mrs. Nugent, and in Mary\'s deep mourning,\r\nbut there is more tenderness than poignancy in sorrow for shocks of\r\ncorn gathered in full season, and all was cheerful about her.\r\n\r\nShe had quite a triumph the next day, as old friends dropped in for the\r\nchance of seeing her.  The least agreeable encounter was that with\r\nMark, who came in on his way to the office, having just received by the\r\nsecond post a letter from his father inquiring into Miss Headworth\'s\r\nstate.  He met Nuttie in the vestibule, with her hat on, and in a great\r\nhurry, as she wanted to walk with Mary to the School of Art, Gerard\r\nGodfrey accompanying them as far as the office; and she did not at all\r\nlike the being called to account, and asked what could have possessed\r\nher to take alarm.\r\n\r\n\'Why, you wrote yourself!\'\r\n\r\n\'I!\'\r\n\r\n\'To Annaple Ruthven.\'\r\n\r\n\'What am I supposed to have written?\'\r\n\r\n\'That Aunt Ursel was very ill with bronchitis.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll be bound that Miss Ruthven said no such thing.  You don\'t pretend\r\nthat you heard it from herself?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; but Blanche did.\'\r\n\r\n\'Blanche!  Oh, that accounts for it!  Though I should have thought you\r\nknew Blanche by this time.\'\r\n\r\n\'But what did you say?\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe I said I couldn\'t get a knitting pattern Miss Headworth was\r\nto send Lady Ronnisglen because she was in bed with a cold.  What you\r\nand Blanche could contrive to make of a simple thing like that--\'\r\n\r\n\'And Annaple!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' but checking himself with a smile, \'we will not fight about\r\nthat.  I only hope it has not brought you into an awkward scrape,\r\nNuttie.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t help that,\' she answered with her head rather high.\r\n\r\n\'You have written and explained?\' he said anxiously.\r\n\r\n\'To my mother, of course.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I were you,\' he said, lowering his voice, \'I should write or send a\r\nspecial message to your father.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t see why.  It was a mistake.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yours was a strong measure, and he won\'t like it.  Be advised, Nuttie.\r\nRecollect your mother.  The best way would be to go home at once.  I\r\ncould get a day to take you--if you would start this afternoon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you; I\'m not going back till I hear,\' she said proudly.\r\n\r\nTime being up, Mark took his leave hastily, and as he shut the door,\r\nNuttie uttered half aloud the words she had scarcely repressed, \'No, I\r\nthank you, Mr. Mark, I am not going back like a dog in a string.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, was that what he expected of you?\' said Gerard Godfrey, whom she\r\nhad not intended to hear her, but who had come out of the sitting-room\r\non the sounds of departure.\r\n\r\n\'He said he would take me home if I could go at once.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wouldn\'t he have liked it!\' exclaimed Gerard.\r\n\r\n\'It might be the best way,\' said Miss Nugent, who had followed young\r\nGodfrey.\r\n\r\n\'Now, Miss Mary,\' cried Nuttie, \'as if I could shorten my holiday now\r\nthat I have it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I don\'t see what business he had to call you to account,\' said\r\nGerard.  \'A stuck-up fellow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course all the Egremonts are set against my being here,\' said\r\nNuttie.\r\n\r\n\'I thought the Canon offered to bring you last year,\' said Mary gently.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that was only to Monks Horton!  It would have been simply\r\ntantalising.\'\r\n\r\n\'Lady Kirkaldy is an excellent person,\' said Miss Nugent.\r\n\r\n\'Is she at home now?\' asked Ursula.\r\n\r\n\'Coming next week, they tell me,\' said Gerard.\r\n\r\n\'He--your cousin--will always be loafing up there now, giving up all\r\nthat he had undertaken, I suppose.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not very likely,\' said Mary quietly.\r\n\r\nIt is a mere Scottish anti-church influence,\' said Gerard, turning\r\nround at the swing-door of his office.  \'Why else will Egremont not\r\ntake the pledge?\'\r\n\r\nWherewith he disappeared, blue ribbon and all, while Mary smiled,\r\nthough she was vexed; and Nuttie observed, \'Poor Gerard; but I can\'t\r\nsee why he should be jealous of Mark _now_.\'\r\n\r\nMary did not choose to understand what Nuttie implied in her\r\nsimplicity, and made answer, \'He is rather blue ribbon mad.  Besides, I\r\nam afraid the fact of being a "swell" does not conduce to your cousin\'s\r\npopularity among the clerks.\'\r\n\r\n\'Surely he does not give himself airs,\' said Ursula, her family\r\nfeelings awaking.\r\n\r\n\'No; but I fancy he is rather reserved.\'\r\n\r\n\'What\'s this about giving up what he has undertaken?  What is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'When Mr. Dutton went to London, he asked Mark to take his Sunday\r\nafternoons with the big lads.  He thought they wanted some one with\r\nmore resources and variety than there is in poor Gerard, who didn\'t at\r\nall like being passed over.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never should have thought it of Mark.  He never dreamt of teaching\r\nanybody at home.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very likely not, but there is an atmosphere at St. Ambrose\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'And oh, how glad I am to be in it!  I wonder how long they will let me\r\nstay!  The dear little mother will try to get me a Sunday here, if she\r\ndares.  Indeed, I can\'t hear before Saturday, and then there would\r\nhardly be time to get home!  Oh, that\'s jolly!  I\'ll go to the nursery\r\ngardens, and get _such_ flowers for the vases!\'\r\n\r\nSaturday brought Nuttie a letter, but not from her mother--\r\n\r\n\r\n\'My Dear Ursula--I write because we are anxious to keep your mother as\r\nquiet as possible.  It was a serious shock to her to find that you had\r\nleft home, and she naturally supposed that Miss Headworth was in great\r\ndanger.  Your father was greatly displeased, and she has been much\r\novercome, and very unwell, but we hope by keeping her perfectly quiet\r\nthat worse consequences may be prevented.  Your father desires you to\r\nremain where you are for the present, as he will not have her disturbed\r\nagain.  Your mother sends her love both to you and to your aunt, and\r\ndesires me to say that she will write in a day or two, and that she\r\nthinks you had better not come back till she is better and your\r\nfather\'s vexation has diminished.\r\n\r\n\'I wish you had informed us of your intentions, as then we could have\r\nascertained the grounds of the report that terrified you so\r\nstrangely.--I remain your affectionate aunt,\r\n\r\n                                         JANE M. EGREMONT.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Poor mother! he has been sneering at us all in his dreadful cynical\r\nway, and knocked her up into one of her awful headaches,\' said Nuttie,\r\nwho felt extremely angered by the grave tone of rebuke in the letter,\r\nand tossed it over to her aunt without absolutely reading it all.  Miss\r\nHeadworth was a good deal distressed, and anxious to know what Mrs.\r\nWilliam Egremont meant; but Nuttie positively declared, \'Oh, it is her\r\nheadaches!  You know she always had them more or less, and they have\r\ngrown a great deal worse since she has taken to sitting in that horrid,\r\nstuffy, perfumy, cigar-ry room, and doesn\'t take half exercise enough.\'\r\n\r\nAnd when Miss Headworth showed herself much concerned about the state\r\nof things, Nuttie coaxed her, and declared that she should fancy\r\nherself unwelcome, and have to go and beg a lodging somewhere instead\r\nof enjoying her reprieve.  And Aunt Ursel was far less impervious to\r\ncoaxing than she used to be when she was the responsible head of a\r\nboarding house.  She did most thoroughly enjoy the affection of her\r\ngreat niece, and could not persuade herself to be angry with her,\r\nespecially when the girl looked up smiling and said, \'If the worst came\r\nto the worst and he did disinherit me, the thing would only right\r\nitself.  I always meant to give it back to Mark.\'\r\n\r\nNo great aunt in the world could fail to admire the generous spirit of\r\nthe girl who came back from the great world of luxury, so loving and\r\nhappy in her humble surroundings.  The only sighs were for poor Alice,\r\nin the hands of a man of whom Miss Headworth knew so much evil.  If she\r\nwere not wretched and a victim--and Nuttie did not think her such--she\r\nmust surely be getting spoilt and worldly.  Her daughter implied fears\r\nof this kind, yet who could read her letters and think so?\r\n\r\nNuttie was fortunately too much in awe of the Canoness to write all the\r\npertnesses that tingled at her fingers\' ends, and she sent a proper and\r\nfairly meek letter, intimating, however, that she was only too happy to\r\nremain at Micklethwayte.\r\n\r\nIt was two or three days more before she heard again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'My Own Dear Child--They have let me write at last, and I can say how\r\nmuch I like to think of your nestling up to dear Aunt Ursel, and how\r\nglad I am to find that she was well enough to enjoy you. It is almost\r\nlike being there to hear of you, and the only thing that grieves me is\r\nthat your father was very much vexed at your setting off in that sudden\r\nway, and at my being so foolish about it.  His eyes have been very bad,\r\nand he missed me sadly while I was laid up.  We are neither of us very\r\nstrong, and we think--if Aunt Ursel and Mary can keep you for a little\r\nlonger--it will be better for you to stay on with them, as it might be\r\nas dreary for you as it was last winter, especially as the Rectory folk\r\nwill soon be going into residence.  I will write to them about it and\r\npersuade them to take something for your board, so as to make it easy\r\nfor them.  And then you can have a fire in your room; you must not\r\nleave it off now you are used to it.  My dear, I wish you would write a\r\nlittle apology to your father.  I ought not to conceal that he is\r\nreally very angry, and I think it would be well if you expressed some\r\nregret, or if you cannot truthfully do that, asked his pardon for your\r\nimpetuosity; for you know he cannot be expected to realise all that\r\ndear Aunt Ursel is to us.  You cannot think how kind your Aunt Jane has\r\nbeen to me; I did not think she could have been so tender.  This is the\r\nfirst letter I ever had to write to you, my own dear child.  I miss you\r\nevery moment, but after all it is better you should be away till your\r\nfather has overlooked this hurried expedition of yours.  I am sure he\r\nwould if you wrote him a real nice letter, telling how you were really\r\nfrightened, and that it was not a mere excuse.  Pray do, and then you\r\ncan come back to your loving little mother.\r\n\r\n                                \'A. E.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'As if I would or could,\' quoth Nuttie to herself.  \'Apologise to him\r\nindeed, for loving the aunt who toiled for us when he deserted us. Poor\r\nlittle mother, she can\'t really expect it of me.  Indeed, I don\'t think\r\nshe quite knows what she wants, or whether she likes me to be here or\r\nat Bridgefield!  My belief is that he bullies her less when I am out of\r\nthe way, because she just gives way to him, and does not assert any\r\nprinciple.  I\'ve tried to back her up, and it is of no use, and I am\r\nsure I don\'t want such a winter as the last.  So I am much better here;\r\nand as to begging pardon, when I have done nothing wrong, I am sure I\r\nwon\'t, to please anybody.  I shall tell her that she ought to know me\r\nbetter than to expect it!\'\r\n\r\nBut Nuttie did not show the letter either to Aunt Ursel or Mary Nugent;\r\nnor did she see that in which Alice had satisfied them that it might be\r\nbetter that her daughter should pay them a long visit, while Mr.\r\nEgremont\'s health required constant attendance, and the Canon\'s family\r\nwere at Redcastle.  And as her husband was always open-handed, she\r\ncould make Ursula\'s stay with them advantageous to their slender means,\r\nwithout hurting their feelings.\r\n\r\nShe told them as much as she could, but there was more that no living\r\ncreature might know, namely, the advantage that Gregorio had gained\r\nover that battlefield, his master, during her days of illness.  The\r\nfirst cold weather had brought on pain, and anger and anxiety, nervous\r\nexcitement and sleeplessness, which the valet had taken upon him to\r\ncalm with a narcotic under a new name that at first deceived her till\r\nshe traced its effects, and inquired of Dr. Hammond about it.\r\nUnwillingly, on her account, he enlightened her, and showed her that,\r\nthough the last year\'s care had done much to loosen the bonds of the\r\nsubtle and alluring habit, yet that any resumption of it tended to\r\nplunge its victim into the fatal condition of the confirmed\r\nopium-eater, giving her every hope at the same time that this\r\npropensity might be entirely shaken off, and that the improvement in\r\nMr. Egremont\'s health and habits which had set in might be confirmed,\r\nand raise him above the inclination.\r\n\r\nCould she have been rid of Gregorio, she would have felt almost sure of\r\nvictory; but as it was, she believed the man absolutely meant to baffle\r\nher, partly out of a spiteful rivalry, partly because his master\'s\r\ntorpid indolence could be used to his own advantage.  She was\r\nabsolutely certain that his sneering tone of remark made her husband\r\ndoubly disinclined to let any religious book be near, or to permit her\r\nto draw him to any Sunday observance.\r\n\r\nThe battle must be fought out alone.  The gentle woman could have no\r\nearthly helper in the struggle.  The Canon and Mark, the only persons\r\nwho could have given her the slightest aid, were both at a distance,\r\neven if her loyal heart could have brooked confession to them, and she\r\nonly hoped that Nuttie would never know of it.  Only aid from above\r\ncould be with her in the daily, hourly effort of cheerfulness,\r\npatience, and all the resources of feminine affection, to avert the\r\ntemptation; and she well knew that the presence of the ardent,\r\nunsubdued, opinionative girl would, alas! only double the difficulties.\r\nSo she acquiesced, at least for the present, in Nuttie\'s grand\r\nachievement of having broken away from all the wealth and luxury of\r\nBridgefield to return to her simple home and good old aunt.  Mark was a\r\ngood deal vexed, but Nuttie did not care about that, attributing this\r\ndispleasure to Egremont clanship; Mary Nugent was doubtful and anxious,\r\nand thought it her duty to reconcile herself to her father; but Miss\r\nHeadworth, who, be it remembered, had reason to have the worst\r\nimpressions of Mr. Egremont, rejoiced in her young niece having escaped\r\nfrom him for the time, and only sighed over the impossibility of\r\nAlice\'s doing the same.  And when Nuttie described, as she constantly\r\ndid, the various pleasures she had enjoyed during the past year, the\r\ngood old lady secretly viewed her as a noble Christian heroine for\r\nresigning all this in favour of the quiet little home at Micklethwayte,\r\nthough reticent before her, and discussed her excellence whenever she\r\nwas alone with Mary.\r\n\r\nNor would Miss Nugent vex her with contradictions or hints that what\r\nNuttie was giving up at present might be a dull house, with her mother\r\nengrossed by an irritable semi-invalid, and the few gaieties to be\r\nenjoyed by the help of the Canon\'s family at Redcastle.  She did ask\r\nthe girl whether Mrs. Egremont, being avowedly not quite well, might\r\nnot need her assistance; but Nuttie vehemently disavowed being of any\r\npossible use to her father; he never let her read to him! oh no! he\r\ncalled her music schoolgirly, a mere infliction; he never spoke to her\r\nif he could help it, and then it was always with a sort of sneer; she\r\nbelieved he could not bear the sight of her, and was ashamed of it, as\r\nwell he might be!  For Mrs. Houghton\'s disclosures had rankled ever\r\nsince within her, and had been confirmed by her aunt.\r\n\r\n\'But that is very sad,\' said Mary.  \'I am so sorry for you.  Ought you\r\nnot to try hard to conquer his distaste?\'\r\n\r\n\'I--why, he cares for nothing good!\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay,\' smiling.  \'Not for your mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!  She\'s pretty, you know; besides, she makes herself a regular\r\nslave to him, and truckles to him in everything, as I could never do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps she is overcoming evil with good.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid it is more like being overcome of evil.  No, no, dear Miss\r\nMary, don\'t be shocked.  The dear little mother never would be anything\r\nbut good in her own sweet self, but it is her nature not to stand up\r\nfor anything, you know.  She seems to me just like a Christian woman\r\nthat has been obliged to marry some Paynim knight. And it perfectly\r\nprovokes me to see her quite gratified at his notice, and ready to\r\nsacrifice anything to him, now I know how he treated her.  If I had\r\nbeen in her place, I wouldn\'t have gone back to him; no, not if he had\r\nbeen ready to crown me after I was dead, like Ines de Castro.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know that you would have had much choice in that case.\'\r\n\r\n\'My very ghost would have rebelled,\' said Nuttie, laughing a little.\r\n\r\nAnd Mary could believe that Mrs. Egremont, with all her love for her\r\ndaughter, might find it a relief not to have to keep the peace between\r\nthe father and child.  \'Yet,\' she said to herself, \'if Mr. Dutton were\r\nhere, he would have taken her back the first day.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nDISENCHANTMENT.\r\n\r\n  \'He promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbons.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Ambrose\'s road was perfectly delightful as long as there was any\r\nexpectation of a speedy recall.  Every day was precious; every meeting\r\nwith an old face was joyful; each interchange of words with Mr. Spyers\r\nor Gerard Godfrey was hailed as a boon; nothing was regretted but the\r\nabsence of Monsieur and his master, and that the favourite choir boy\'s\r\nvoice was cracked.\r\n\r\nBut when there was reason to think that success had been complete, when\r\nMiss Headworth had been persuaded by Mary that it was wiser on all\r\naccounts not to mortify Alice by refusing the two guineas a week\r\noffered for Miss Egremont\'s expenses; when a couple of boxes of clothes\r\nand books had arrived, and Ursula found herself settled at\r\nMicklethwayte till after Christmas, she began first to admit to herself\r\nthat somehow the place was not all that it had once been to her.\r\n\r\nHer mother was absent, that was one thing.  Mrs. Nugent was gone, that\r\nwas another.  There was no Monsieur or Mr. Dutton to keep her in awe of\r\nhis precision, even while she laughed at it.  There were no boarders to\r\npatronise and play with, and her education at the High School was over.\r\nIf she saw a half-clothed child, it was not half so interesting to buy\r\nan ulster in the next shop, as it was to turn over the family rag-bag,\r\nknit, sew, and contrive!  Somehow things had a weariness in them, and\r\nthe little excitements did not seem to be the exquisite delights they\r\nused to be.  After having seen Patience at the Princess\'s it was not\r\neasy to avoid criticising a provincial Lady Jane, and it was the like\r\nwith other things of more importance.  Even the ritual of St. Ambrose\'s\r\nChurch no longer struck her as the ne plus ultra of beauty, and only\r\nincited her to describe London churches.\r\n\r\nShe resumed her Sunday-school classes, and though she talked at first\r\nof their raciness and freedom, she soon longed after the cleanliness,\r\nrespectfulness, and docility of the despised little Bridgefordites, and\r\nuttered bitter things of Micklethwayte turbulence, declaring--perhaps\r\nnot without truth--that the children had grown much worse in her\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nAnd as Mr. Godfrey had been superintendent during the latter half of\r\nthe time, this was a cruel stroke.  He wanted to make her reverse her\r\nopinions.  And they never met without \'Now, Ursula, don\'t you remember\r\nJem Burton putting on Miss Pope\'s spectacles, and grinning at all the\r\nclass.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; and how Mr. Dutton brought him up to beg her pardon.  Now, was\r\nany notice taken when that horrid boy--I don\'t know his name--turned\r\nthe hymn they were saying to her into "Tommy, make room for your\r\nuncle"?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Albert Cox!  It is no use doing anything to him, he would go off\r\nat once to the Primitives.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let him!\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot make him a schismatic.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what he is now!\'\r\n\r\n\'Besides, Miss Pope perfectly provokes impertinence.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I wouldn\'t give her work she can\'t do.\'\r\n\r\nSuch an argument as this might be very well at the moment of\r\nprovocation, but it became tedious when recurred to at every meeting.\r\nNuttie began to wonder when Monks Horton would be inhabited again, and\r\nhow much notice Lady Kirkaldy would take of her, and she was a good\r\ndeal disappointed when Mark told her that Lord Kirkaldy had been begged\r\nto undertake a diplomatic mission which would keep them abroad all the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain weariness and want of interest.  It was not exactly\r\nthat there was nothing intellectual going on.  There were the lectures,\r\nbut they were on chemistry, for which Nuttie cared little. There were\r\ngood solid books, and lively ones too, but they seemed passe to one who\r\nhad heard them discussed in town.  Mary and Miss Headworth read and\r\ntalked them over, and perhaps their opinions were quite as wise, and\r\nMiss Nugent\'s conversation was equal to that of any of Nuttie\'s London\r\nfriends, but it was only woman\'s talk after all--the brilliancy and\r\npiquancy, the touch and go, she had enjoyed in Lady Kirkaldy\'s\r\ndrawing-room was lacking.\r\n\r\nMr. Spyers was too much immersed in parish matters to read anything\r\nsecular, and neither he nor Gerard Godfrey seemed ever to talk of\r\nanything but parish matters.  There was not the slightest interest in\r\nanything beyond.  Foreign politics, European celebrities,--things in\r\nwhich Nuttie had learnt to take warm interest when with the Kirkaldys,\r\nwere nothing to them.  Even Mary wondered at her endeavours to see the\r\nday\'s paper, and she never obtained either information or sympathy\r\nunless she came across Mark.  It seemed to her that Gerard cared less\r\nfor the peace or war of an empire than for a tipsy cobbler taking the\r\npledge.  The monotony and narrowness of the world where she had once\r\nbeen so happy fretted and wearied her, though she was ashamed of\r\nherself all the time, and far too proud to allow that she was tired of\r\nit all.  Aunt Ursel at her best had always been a little dry and grave,\r\nan authority over the two nieces; and though softened, she was not\r\nexpansive, did not invite confidences, and home was not home without\r\nthe playfellow-mother.\r\n\r\nAnd most especially was she daily tired of Gerard Godfrey!  Had he\r\nalways talked of nothing but \'the colours,\' chants, E. C. U., classes,\r\nand teetotalism?  Whatever she began it always came back to one or\r\nother of these subjects, and when she impatiently declared that she was\r\nperfectly sick of hearing of the Use of Sarum, he looked at her as\r\nguilty of a profanity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was true that he was narrower than he had been.  He was a\r\ngood, honest, religiously-minded lad, but with no great depth or grasp\r\nof intellect; Ursula Egremont had been his companion first and then his\r\nromance, and the atmosphere of the community in which he lived had been\r\nstudious and intelligent.  His expedition to Redcastle had convinced\r\nhim that the young lady lived in a different world, entirely beyond his\r\nreach, and in the reaction of his hopelessness, he had thrown himself\r\ninto the excitement of the mission, and it had worked on him a zealous\r\npurpose to dedicate himself totally to a religious life, giving up all\r\nworldly aims, and employing the small capital he could call his own in\r\npreparing for the ministry.  Mr. Dutton had insisted that he should\r\ntest his own steadfastness and resolution by another year\'s work in his\r\npresent situation before he took any steps.\r\n\r\nHe had submitted, but still viewed himself as dedicated, and so far as\r\nbusiness hours permitted, gave his services like a clerical pupil to\r\nSt. Ambrose\'s with the greatest energy, and perhaps somewhat less\r\njudgment than if Mr. Dutton had been at hand.  Being without natural\r\ntaste for intellectual pursuits, unless drawn into them by his\r\nsurroundings, he had dropped them entirely, and read nothing but the\r\nephemeral controversial literature of his party, and not much of that,\r\nfor he was teaching, preaching, exhorting, throughout his spare time;\r\nwhile the vicar was in too great need of help to insist on deepening\r\nthe source from which his zealous assistant drew.  As Miss Nugent\r\nobserved, teetotalism was to him what dissipation was to other young\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nOn this vehemence of purpose descended suddenly Ursula Egremont once\r\nmore; and the human heart could not but be quickened with the idea, not\r\nentirely unfounded, that it was to him that she had flown back, and\r\nthat her exile proved that she cared for him more than for all the\r\ndelights she had enjoyed as heiress of Bridgefield.  The good youth was\r\nconscientious to the back-bone, and extremely perplexed between his\r\nself-dedication and the rights that their implied understanding might\r\ngive to her.  Was she to be the crowning blessing of his life, to be\r\nsaved partly through his affection from worldly trials and temptations,\r\nand bestowing on him a brilliant lot in which boundless good could be\r\neffected?  Or was she a syren luring him to abandon his higher and\r\nbetter purposes?\r\n\r\nThe first few days of her stay, the former belief made him feel like\r\ntreading on air, or like the hero of many a magazine story; but as time\r\nwent on this flattering supposition began to fail him, when Nuttie\r\nshowed her weariness of the subjects which, in his exclusiveness, he\r\ndeemed the only ones worthy of a Christian, or rather of a Catholic.\r\nBoth of them had outgrown the lively, aimless chatter and little jests\r\nthat had succeeded the games of childhood, and the growth had been in\r\ndifferent directions, so that Ursula felt herself untrue to her old\r\nromance when she became weary of his favourite topics, disappointed by\r\nhis want of sympathy and comprehension, fretted by his petty\r\ndisapprovals, and annoyed by his evident distaste for Mark, to whom she\r\nturned as to one of her proper world.\r\n\r\nAt last, after many tossings, Gerard fixed upon a test.  If she endured\r\nit she would be the veritable maiden of his imagination, and they would\r\nstand by one another, come what would; if not, he would believe that\r\nthe past had been fancy, not love, or love that had not withstood the\r\nattractions of fashionable life.  A great temperance meeting was coming\r\non, and Gerard, eager at once to fill the room, and to present a goodly\r\nroll of recruits, watched anxiously for his moment, and came on Nuttie\r\nwith his hands full of bills in huge letters, and his pockets of badges.\r\n\r\n\'Excellent speakers,\' he cried.  \'We shall have the hall crowded.\r\nYou\'ll come, Ursula?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what Miss Mary will do.  I don\'t think she means it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if you insist, if we both insist, she will.  Look at the paper--we\r\nare to have some splendid experiences.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie made a face.  \'I\'ve heard all about those,\' she said.  \'That\r\nman,\' pointing to one of the names, \'regularly rants about it; he is\r\nlike a madman.\'\r\n\r\n\'He does go rather far, but it is quite necessary, as you will hear.\r\nOh, Nuttie, if you would only be one of us!  I\'ve brought a card!  If\r\nyou would!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'s the use, Gerard!  I don\'t like wine, I never do drink it,\r\nexcept a little claret-cup sometimes when I can\'t get water.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it would cost you nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it would.  It would make me ridiculous.\'\r\n\r\n\'You used not to heed the sneers of the world.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not for anything worth doing--but this is not.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is the greatest cause of the day!\' he cried, in an eager exalted\r\nmanner, which somewhat inclined her to laugh.  \'Do away with alcohol\r\nand you would do away with crime!\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you for the compliment, Gerard; I never found that the\r\ninfinitesimal drop of alcohol that I suppose there is in a tumbler of\r\nclaret-cup disposed me to commit crimes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why won\'t you understand me, Ursula!  Can\'t you give up that for the\r\nsake of saving others!\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder whom it would save.\'\r\n\r\n\'Example saves!  If you put on this\'--taking out the badge--\'how many\r\nshould you not lead at your home?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just nobody!  Mother and I should have a bad time of it, that\'s all.\'\r\n\r\n\'And if you endured, what would not your testimony effect in the\r\nhousehold and village?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing!  I have nothing to do with the men-servants, and as to the\r\nvillage, it is very sober.  There\'s only one public house, and that is\r\nkept by Uncle William\'s old butler, and is as orderly as can be.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! that\'s the way you all deceive yourselves.  Moderate drinkers are\r\nten times more mischievous than regular drunkards.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Gerard!  And outrageous abstainers are more mischievous\r\nthan either of them, because they make the whole thing so utterly\r\nfoolish and absurd.\'  She was really angry now, and so was Gerard.\r\n\r\n\'Is that your ultimatum?\' he asked, in a voice that he strove to render\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly; I\'m not going to take the pledge.\'\r\n\r\nHaving quarrelled in childhood, made quarrelling now easier, and Gerard\r\nanswered bitterly:\r\n\r\n\'Very well, I hope you will have no cause to repent it.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis not the way to make me repent it, to see how it seems to affect\r\nsome people\'s common sense.  It is just as if all your brains had run\r\nto water!\' said Nuttie, laughing a little; but Gerard was desperately\r\nserious, and coloured vehemently.\r\n\r\n\'Very well, Miss Egremont, I understand.  I have had my answer,\' he\r\nsaid, gathering up his papers and marching out of the room.\r\n\r\nShe stood still, offended, and not in the least inclined to run after\r\nhim and take back her words.  He, poor fellow, stumbled down the steps,\r\nand held by the garden rail to collect his senses and compose himself.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the matter, Gerard, are you ill or giddy?\' asked Miss Nugent,\r\ncoming up in the winter twilight.\r\n\r\n\'No, oh no!  Only the dream of my life is over,\' he answered, scarce\r\nknowing what he said.\r\n\r\n\'You haven\'t--\' cried Mary aghast.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no,\' he said, understanding the blank, \'only she won\'t take the\r\npledge!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see how she could or ought,\' responded Mary.  \'Is that all?\'\r\n\r\n\'I had made it the test,\' muttered poor Gerard.  \'It is right!  It is\r\nall over now.  I shall know how to go on my way.  It is best so--I know\r\nit is--only I did not know whether anything was due to her.\'  It was\r\nalmost a sob.\r\n\r\n\'Dear old Gerard,\' said Mary, \'I see you meant to do right.  It is well\r\nyour mind should be settled.  I think you\'ll find comfort in your good\r\nwork.\'\r\n\r\nHe wrung her hand, and she went in, half amused, for she was fully\r\naware of the one-sidedness of the mania for temperance under which he\r\nacted, yet honouring his high, pure motives, and rejoicing that he had\r\nfound this indirect mode of gauging Nuttie\'s feelings towards him--that\r\nis, if he was right about them, and there was no revulsion.\r\n\r\nFar from it.  Nuttie was still angry.  \'Gerard had been so ridiculous,\'\r\nshe said, \'teasing her to take the pledge, and quite incapable of\r\nunderstanding her reasons.  I can\'t think why Gerard has grown so\r\nstupid.\'\r\n\r\n\'Enthusiasms carry people away,\' returned Mary.\r\n\r\n\'If Mr. Dutton had only stayed, he would have kept Gerard like\r\nhimself,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\nBut there was no relenting.  The two young people avoided each other;\r\nand perhaps Nuttie was secretly relieved that the romance she had\r\noutgrown no longer entangled her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nA FAILURE.\r\n\r\n  \'Would I had loved her more!\'--Mrs. Hemans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'On the 14th of January, at Bridgefield Egremont, the wife of Alwyn\r\nPiercefield Egremont, Esquire, a son and heir.\'\r\n\r\nUrsula had been prepared for this event for about a fortnight by a long\r\ntender letter from her mother, mourning over the not meeting at\r\nChristmas, and the long separation, but saying that she had wished to\r\nspare the long anxiety, and that it had been a trying time which she\r\nfelt herself able to cope with better alone, than even with her dear\r\nNuttie, knowing her to be happy and safe with Aunt Ursel.  Now, if all\r\nwent well, they would have a happy meeting, and begin on a new score.\r\n\'If the will of God should be otherwise,\' added Alice, \'I am sure I\r\nneed not entreat my Nuttie to do and be all that she can to her father.\r\nMy child, you do not know how sorely he needs such love and tendance\r\nand prayer as you can give him.  I know you have thought I have set you\r\naside--if not better things, for his sake.  Indeed I could not help\r\nit.\'  Then there was something tear-stained and blotted out, and it\r\nended with, \'He is beginning to miss your step and voice about the\r\nhouse.  I believe he will really be glad to see you, when the bright\r\nspring days come, and I can kiss my own Nuttie again.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie was very much delighted, but a little hurt that her aunt and\r\nMary should have been in the secret, and pledged to say nothing to her\r\ntill her mother should write.  She found, moreover, that Miss Headworth\r\nwas extremely anxious and not altogether reassured by Mrs. William\r\nEgremont\'s letter of announcement, which filled Nuttie with delight.\r\nHow happy the little mother must be to have a baby in her arms again,\r\nand though she herself did not profess to have a strong turn for infant\r\nhumanity, it was the greatest possible relief to be no longer an\r\nheiress, excepting that the renunciation in favour of Mark was no\r\nlonger practicable.\r\n\r\nThe residence at Redcastle was not over, but the Canoness had come to\r\nnurse her sister-in-law, and kept up the correspondence.  The son and\r\nheir was reported to be a perfect specimen, and his father was greatly\r\nelated and delighted, but the letters showed anxiety about the mother,\r\nwho did not get on as she ought, and seemed to have no power of rally\r\nabout her.  At length came a letter that seemed to burn itself into\r\nNuttie\'s brain--\r\n\r\n\r\n\'My Dear Ursula--Your mother is longing to see you.  You had better\r\ncome home directly.  Your aunt saved her before.  Tell her if she will\r\ncome, she shall have my deepest gratitude.  I shall send to meet the\r\n5.11 train.--Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n                                       A. P. EGREMONT.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. William Egremont wrote at more length.  Symptoms had set in which\r\nfilled the doctors and nurses with double anxiety.  Advice had been\r\nsent for from London, and Mr. Egremont was in an uncontrollable state\r\nof distress.  She had undertaken to summon Ursula home, and to beg Miss\r\nHeadworth to undertake the journey.  She evidently did not know that\r\nher brother-in-law had written himself, and before they could start a\r\ntelegram terrified them, but proved to contain no fresh tidings, only a\r\nrenewed summons.\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth forgot all her resolutions about Mr. Egremont\'s\r\nhospitality--her Alice was her only thought, and all the remedies that\r\nhad been found efficacious at Dieppe.  The good lady had a certain\r\nconfidence in her own nursing and experience of Alice, which buoyed her\r\nup with hope, while Ursula seemed absolutely stunned.  She had never\r\nthought of such a frightful loss or grief, and her mental senses were\r\nalmost paralysed, so that she went through the journey in a kind of\r\nsurface trance, observing all around her much as usual, looking out for\r\nthe luggage and for the servant who had come to meet them with the\r\nreport \'No change.\'  She did the honours of the carriage, and covered\r\nMiss Headworth with the fur rug.  They wanted it, for they were\r\nshivering with anxiety.\r\n\r\nCanon Egremont came out to the front hall to meet them, and put his\r\narms round Nuttie tenderly, saying, \'My poor dear child!\' then as he\r\nsaw he had frightened them, \'No, no!  She is alive--conscious they say,\r\nonly so very weak.\'  Then with something of his usual urbane grace, he\r\nheld out his hand, \'Miss Headworth, it is very good in you to come.\r\nYou have a great deal to forgive.\'\r\n\r\nHe took them into the tent-room, where tea was standing, interrupting\r\nhimself in the account he was giving to bid Nuttie let her aunt have\r\nsome.  It was plain from his manner that he had given up hope, and in\r\nanother minute in hurried his brother, looking terribly haggard and\r\nwith bloodshot eyes, giving his hand to each, with, \'That\'s right, Miss\r\nHeadworth, thank you.  Come, let me know what you think of her!\'\r\n\r\n\'Does she know they are come?\' said the Canon.  \'No?  Then, Alwyn, let\r\nthem have some tea, and take off their things.  I can tell you, the\r\nnurses will never let them in just off a journey.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Headworth seconded this, and Mr. Egremont submitted, allowing that\r\nshe had not asked for Nuttie since the morning, and then had smiled and\r\nsqueezed his hand when he said she was coming with her aunt; but he\r\nwalked up and down in direful restlessness, his whole mind apparently\r\nbent on extracting from Miss Headworth that she had been as ill or\r\nworse at Dieppe.\r\n\r\nAlas! when Mrs. William Egremont came down to fetch Nuttie; there was\r\nno question that matters were much worse.  The sweet face was perfectly\r\nwhite and wasted, and the heavy lids of the dark eyes scarcely lifted\r\nthemselves, but the lips moved into a smile, and the hand closed on\r\nthat of the girl, who stood by her as one frozen into numbness.  There\r\nwas the same recognition when her aunt was brought to her side, the\r\npoor old lady commanding herself with difficulty, as the loving glance\r\nquivered over the face.\r\n\r\nTime passed on, and she still held Nuttie\'s hand.  Once, when a little\r\nrevived by some stimulant at her lips, she made an effort and said,\r\n\'Stay with him!  Take care of him!  _Love_ him!  And your little\r\nbrother, my Nuttie!  Promise!\'\r\n\r\n\'I promise,\' the girl answered, scarce knowing what she said.\r\n\r\nAnd the eyes closed with an air of peace and rest.\r\n\r\nAgain when Miss Headworth was doing something to ease her position she\r\nsaid, \'Thank you,\' and then more vigorously, \'Thank you, dear aunt, for\r\nall you have been to us.\'\r\n\r\nThere was little more.  She asked Nuttie for \'her hymn,\' the evening\r\nhymn with which mother and daughter used nightly to go to sleep, and\r\nwhich, in her strange dreamy way, the girl managed to say.\r\n\r\nThen a little murmur and sign passed between the elder ladies, and Mrs.\r\nWilliam Egremont fetched her husband.  As he opened his book to find\r\nthe commendatory prayer, thinking her past all outward consciousness,\r\nand grieved by the look of suffering, her eyes again unclosed and her\r\nlips said, \'Failed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t think of that!  God can make failures success.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a half smile, a look of peace.  \'_He_ makes up,\' she said;\r\nand those were the last audible words before it was over, and the\r\ntender spirit was released from its strife, some time later, they only\r\nknew when by the failure of the clasp on her husband\'s hand.\r\n\r\nOld Miss Headworth did not understand the meaning of that sad word till\r\nthe next forenoon.  Then,--as she sat in the darkened tent-room, crying\r\nover her letters,--while the stunned and bewildered Nuttie was, under\r\nher Aunt Jane\'s direction, attending to the needful arrangements, Canon\r\nEgremont wandered in upon her in the overflow of confidence of a man\r\nwith a full heart, wanting to talk it all out, communicating the more,\r\nbecause she was a discreet woman, and asked no questions.  He had tried\r\nto see his brother, but Gregorio had not admitted him.  He was aware\r\nnow of the whole state of things.  Dr. Hammond had told him, when first\r\nbeginning to be alarmed for his patient, that the principal cause for\r\nanxiety was the exhaustion caused by the long strain on her spirits and\r\nstrength consequent on her efforts to wean her husband from his fatal\r\npropensity.  There had been other \'complications,\' as the doctor called\r\nthem, and more immediate causes of danger, but both he and his\r\ncolleague, summoned from London, believed that she would have\r\nsurmounted them if she had had more strength to rally.  But her nurses\r\ndated the decided turn for the worse from the day when she had gazed up\r\ninto Mr. Egremont\'s face, and detected the look in his eyes that she\r\nhad learnt too well to understand.\r\n\r\nShe would fain have lived, and, according to her obedient nature, had\r\nsubmitted to all the silence and stillness enforced on her; but she had\r\ntold Dr. Hammond that she must see her brother-in-law before she was\r\ntoo far gone.  And the doctor, knowing all, took care it should be\r\nbrought about.\r\n\r\nAnd then she had spoken of her failure in the effort of these years.\r\n\'If I had begun better,\' she said, \'it might not have been so with him.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, indeed you have nothing to blame yourself for.  You were\r\ngrievously sinned against by us all.  Alwyn was no saint when he drew\r\nyou into it--and you, you have been his good angel, doing all and more\r\ntoo,\' said the Canon, almost breaking down.\r\n\r\n\'I tried--but if I had been a better woman--And to leave him to that\r\nman!\'\r\n\r\n\'Child, child, victories sometimes come this way!\' he cried, scarce\r\nknowing how it was put into his mouth, but glad to see the light in her\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\'Thanks,\' she replied.  \'No, I ought not to have said that.  I leave\r\nhim to God, and my poor Nuttie.  I want you to tell her, if I can\'t,\r\nwhat she must try to do.  If I had but brought them together more! But\r\nI tried for the best.\'\r\n\r\nThen she begged for her last communion, saying, \'I do pray for that\r\npoor Gregorio.  Isn\'t that forgiving him?\'  And the attempt to exchange\r\nforgiveness with the Canon for their mutual behaviour at the time of\r\nher marriage overcame them both so much that they had to leave it not\r\nhalf uttered.  Indeed, in speaking of the scene, William Egremont was\r\nutterly overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n\'And that\'s the woman that I treated as a mere outcast!\' he cried,\r\nwalking about the little room.  \'Oh God, forgive me!  I shall never\r\nforgive myself.\'\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Headworth!  In past days she had longed for any amount of\r\nretribution on Alice\'s hard-hearted employers, but it was a very\r\ndifferent thing to witness such grief and self reproach.  He had in\r\ntruth much more developed ideas of duty, both as man and priest, than\r\nwhen he had passively left a disagreeable subject to his mother-in-law,\r\nas lying within a woman\'s province; and his good heart was suffering\r\nacutely for the injustice and injury in which he had shared towards one\r\nnow invested with an almost saintly halo.\r\n\r\nIn the gush of feeling he had certainly revealed more to Miss\r\nHeadworth, than his wife, or even he himself, in his cooler moments,\r\nwould have thought prudent, and he ended by binding her to secrecy; and\r\nsaying that he should only tell his niece what was necessary for her to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nNuttie was going about, dry-eyed and numbed, glad of any passing\r\noccupation that would prevent the aching sense of desolation at her\r\nheart from gaining force to overwhelm her; courting employment, and\r\nshunning pity and condolence, but she could not escape when her uncle\r\ntook her hand, made her sit down by him, with \'I want to speak to you,\r\nmy dear;\' and told her briefly and tenderly what her mother\'s effort\r\nhad been, and of the message and task she had bequeathed. The poor\r\ngirl\'s heart fainted within her.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! but, Uncle William, how can I?  How can I ever?  Mother could do\r\nthings I never could!  He _did_ care for her!  He does not care for me!\'\r\n\r\n\'You must teach him to do so, Nuttie.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' she said, with a hopeless sound.\r\n\r\nThe Canon did think it very hopeless in his heart, but he persevered,\r\nas in duty bound.  \'I told your dear mother that perhaps you would\r\nsucceed where she thought she had failed, though indeed she had done\r\nmuch.  It made her happy.  So, my dear child, you are bound to do your\r\nbest.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes;\' then, after a pause--\'But mother could coax him and manage him.\r\nMother was with him day and night; she could always get at him. What\r\ncan I do?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think you will find that he depends upon you more,\' said the Canon,\r\n\'and it may be made easier to you, if you only set your will to it.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I ought, I\'ll try,\' said poor Nuttie, more humbly perhaps than she\r\nhad ever spoken before, but in utter dejection, and her uncle answered\r\nher like a child.\r\n\r\n\'There, that\'s a good girl.  Nobody can do more.\'\r\n\r\nFor the Canon had one hope.  He had not thought it becoming to speak to\r\nher of the counter influence, but he could not help thinking it\r\npossible that if he and his son, backed by doctor and lawyer, made a\r\nlong pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether, they might induce his\r\nbrother to part with Gregorio, and this would render Ursula\'s task far\r\nless impossible.\r\n\r\nHe was confirmed in this hope by finding that Mark\'s arrival was not\r\nunwelcome to Mr. Egremont, who seemed to have forgotten the\r\nunpleasantness with which he had regarded the engagement, and only\r\nremembered that his nephew had been Alice\'s champion, resuming old\r\ncustoms of dependence, making him act as amanuensis, and arraigning the\r\ndestiny that had restored so lovely and charming a creature only to\r\nsnatch her away, leaving nothing but a headstrong girl and a helpless\r\nbaby.\r\n\r\nThat poor little fellow was all that could be desired at his age, but\r\nNuttie felt her beautiful mother almost insulted when the elder ladies\r\ntalked of the wonderful resemblance that the Canoness declared to have\r\nbeen quite startling in the earlier hours of his life.  For the\r\nconvenience of one of the sponsors, he was to be christened in the\r\nafternoon following the funeral, the others being--by his mother\'s\r\nspecial entreaty--his sister and Mark.  Egremont customs were against\r\nthe ladies going to the funeral, so that Nuttie was kept at home, much\r\nagainst her will; but after the luncheon she escaped, leaving word with\r\nher aunts that she was going to walk down to church alone, and they\r\nwere sorry enough for her to let her have her own way, especially as\r\nher father, having been to the funeral, had shut himself up and left\r\nall the rest to them.\r\n\r\nThe Egremont family had a sort of enclosure or pen with iron rails\r\nround it close to the church wall, where they rested under flat slabs.\r\nThe gate in this was open now, and the new-made grave was one mass of\r\nwhite flowers,--wreaths and crosses, snowdrops, hyacinths, camellias,\r\nand the like,--and at the feet was a flowerpot with growing plants of\r\nthe white hyacinth called in France \'lys de la Vierge.\'  These, before\r\nthey became frequent in England, had been grown in Mr. Dutton\'s\r\ngreenhouse, and having been favourites with Mrs. Egremont, it had come\r\nto be his custom every spring to bring her the earliest plants that\r\nbloomed.  Nuttie knew them well, the careful tying up, the neat\r\narrangement of moss over the earth, the peculiar trimness of the whole;\r\nand as she looked, the remembrance of the happy times of old, the sick\r\nlonging for all that was gone, did what nothing had hitherto\r\neffected--brought an overwhelming gush of tears.\r\n\r\nThere was no checking them now that they had come.  She fled into\r\nchurch on the first sounds of arrival and hid herself in the friendly\r\nshelter of the great family pew; but she had to come out and take her\r\nplace, though she could hardly utter a word, and it was all that she\r\ncould do to keep from sobbing aloud; she could not hand the babe, and\r\nthe Canon had to take on trust the name \'Alwyn Headworth,\' for he could\r\nnot hear the words that were on her trembling lips.\r\n\r\nIt was soon over; and while the baby and his attendants, with Miss\r\nHeadworth, were being packed into the carriage, and her uncle and aunt\r\nbowing off the grand god-father, she clutched her cousin\'s arm, and\r\nsaid, \'Mark; where\'s Mr. Dutton?\'\r\n\r\n\'I--I didn\'t know he was coming, but now you ask, I believe I saw him\r\nthis morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know he is here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you want to see him?\' said Mark kindly.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if I might!\'\r\n\r\nThen, with a sudden impulse, she looked back into the church, and\r\nrecognised a black figure and slightly bald head bowed down in one of\r\nthe seats.  She pointed him out.  \'No doubt he is waiting for us all to\r\nbe gone,\' said Mark in a low voice.  \'You go into the Rectory, Nuttie;\r\nthere\'s a fire in the study, and I\'ll bring him to you there. I\'ll get\r\nhim to stay the night if I can.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, thank you!\' and it was a really fervent answer.\r\n\r\nMark waited, and when Mr. Dutton rose, was quite shocked at his\r\npaleness and the worn look on his face, as of one who had struggled\r\nhard for resignation and calm.  He started, almost as if a blow had\r\nbeen struck him, as Mark uttered his name in the porch, no doubt having\r\nnever meant to be perceived nor to have to speak to any one; but in one\r\nmoment his features had recovered their usual expression of courteous\r\nreadiness.  He bowed his head when Mark told him that Ursula wanted to\r\nshake hands with him, and came towards the Rectory, but he entirely\r\ndeclined the invitation to sleep there, declaring that he must return\r\nto London that night.\r\n\r\nMark opened the study door, and then went away to secure that the man\r\nwhom he had learnt to esteem very highly should at least have some\r\nrefreshment before he left the house.\r\n\r\nThose few steps had given Mr. Dutton time to turn from a mourner to a\r\nconsoler, and when Nuttie came towards him with her hand outstretched,\r\nand \'Oh, Mr. Dutton, Mr. Dutton!\' he took it in both his, and with a\r\ncalm broken voice said, \'God has been very good to us in letting us\r\nknow one like her.\'\r\n\r\n\'But oh! what can we do without her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, Nuttie! that always comes before us.  But I saw your work and your\r\ncomfort just now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor little boy!  I shall get to care about him, I know, but as yet I\r\ncan only feel how much rather I would have _her_.\'\r\n\r\n\'No doubt, but it is _her_ work that is left you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Her work?  Yes!  But oh, Mr. Dutton, you don\'t know how dreadful it\r\nis!\'\r\n\r\nHe did not know what she meant.  Whether it was simply the burthen on\r\nany suddenly motherless girl, or any special evil on her father\'s part,\r\nbut he was soon enlightened, for there was something in this old friend\r\nthat drew out her confidence beyond all others, even when he repressed\r\nher, and she could not help telling him in a few murmured furtive words\r\nsuch as she knew she ought not to utter, and he felt it almost treason\r\nto hear.  \'Opiates! she was always trying to keep my father from them!\r\nIt was too much for her!  My uncle says I must try to do it, and I\r\ncan\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor child!\' said Mr. Dutton kindly, though cut to the heart at the\r\nrevelation of sweet Alice\'s trial; \'at least you can strive, and there\r\nis always a blessing on resolution.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if you knew! and he doesn\'t like me.  I don\'t think I\'ve ever been\r\nnice to him, and that vexed her!  I haven\'t got her ways.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Mr. Dutton, \'but you will learn others.  Look here, Nuttie.\r\nYou used to be always craving for grand and noble tasks, the more\r\ndifficult the better.  I think you have got one now, more severe than\r\never could have been thought of--and very noble.  What are those lines\r\nabout the task "bequeathed from bleeding sire to son"?  Isn\'t it like\r\nthat?  You are bound to go on with her work, and the more helpless you\r\nfeel, and the more you throw yourself on God, the more God will help\r\nyou.  He takes the will for the deed, if only you have will enough;\r\nand, Nuttie, you can pray that you may be able to love and honour him.\'\r\n\r\nTeacups were brought in, followed by Mark, and interrupted them; and,\r\nafter a short interval, they parted at the park gate, and Ursula walked\r\nhome with Mark, waked from her dull numb trance, with a crushed feeling\r\nas if she had been bruised all over, and yet with a purpose within her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nFARMS OR UMBRELLAS.\r\n\r\n  \'He tokin into his handis\r\n   His londis and his lode.\'--CHAUCER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Mark!  Mark!\'  A little figure stood on the gravel road leading\r\nthrough Lescombe Park, and lifted up an eager face, as Mark jumped down\r\nfrom his horse.  \'I made sure you would come over.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but I could not get away earlier.  And I have so much to say to\r\nyou and your mother, Annaple; there\'s a great proposition to be\r\nconsidered.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh dear! and here is John bearing down upon us.  Never mind.  We\'ll\r\nget into the mither\'s room and be cosy!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mark,\' said Sir John\'s hearty voice, \'I thought you would be\r\nhere.  Come to luncheon?  That\'s right!  And how is poor Egremont? I\r\nthought he looked awful at the funeral.\'\r\n\r\n\'He is fairly well, thank you; but it was a terrible shock.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should think so.  To find such a pretty sweet creature just to lose\r\nher again.  Child likely to live, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, he is a fine fellow, and has never had anything amiss with\r\nhim.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor little chap!  Doesn\'t know what he has lost!  Well, Nannie,\' as\r\nthey neared the house, \'do you want a tete-a-tete or to take him in to\r\nyour mother?  Here, I\'ll take the horse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come to her at once,\' said Annaple; \'she wants to hear all, and\r\nbesides she is expecting me.\'\r\n\r\nMark was welcomed by Lady Ronnisglen with inquiries for all concerned,\r\nand especially for that \'poor girl.  I do pity a young thing who has to\r\ntake a woman\'s place too soon,\' she said.  \'It takes too much out of\r\nher!\'\r\n\r\n\'I should think Ursula had plenty of spirit,\' said Annaple.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know whether spirit is what is wanted,\' said Mark.  \'Her\r\nmother prevailed more without it than I am afraid she is likely to do\r\nwith it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Complements answer better than parallels sometimes, but not always,\'\r\nsaid Lady Ronnisglen.\r\n\r\n\'Which are we?\' asked Annaple demurely.\r\n\r\n\'Not parallels certainly, for then we should never meet,\' responded\r\nMark.  \'But here is the proposal.  My father and all the rest of us\r\nhave been doing our best to get my uncle to smooth Ursula\'s way by\r\ngetting rid of that valet of his.\'\r\n\r\n\'The man with the Mephistopheles face?\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly.  He is a consummate scoundrel, as we all know, and so does my\r\nuncle himself, but he has been about him these twelve or fourteen\r\nyears, and has got a sort of hold on him--that--that-- It is no use to\r\ntalk of it, but it did not make that dear aunt of mine have an easier\r\nlife.  In fact I should not be a bit surprised if he had been a\r\nhindrance in the hunting her up.  Well, the fellow thought proper to\r\nupset some arrangements my mother had made, and then was more insolent\r\nthan I should have thought even he could have been towards her.  I\r\nsuppose he had got into the habit with poor Aunt Alice.  That made a\r\nfulcrum, and my father went at my uncle with a will.  I never saw my\r\nfather so roused in my life.  I don\'t mean by the behaviour to his\r\nwife, but at what he knew of the fellow, and all the harm he had done\r\nand is doing.  And actually my uncle gave in at last, and consented to\r\ntell Gregorio to look out for another situation, if he has not\r\nfeathered his nest too well to need one, as I believe he has.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that will make it much easier for Ursula!\' cried Annaple.\r\n\r\n\'If he goes,\' put in her mother.\r\n\r\n\'I think he will.  I really had no notion how much these two years have\r\nimproved my uncle!  To be sure, it would be hard to live with such a\r\nwoman as that without being the better for it!  But he really seems to\r\nhave acquired a certain notion of duty!\'\r\n\r\nThey did not smile at the simple way in which Mark spoke of this vast\r\nadvance, and Lady Ronnisglen said, \'I hope so, for the sake of his\r\ndaughter and that poor little boy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think that has something to do with it,\' said Mark.  \'He feels a\r\nresponsibility, and still more, I think he was struck by having a\r\ncreature with him to whom evil was like physical pain.\'\r\n\r\n\'It will work,\' said Lady Ronnisglen.\r\n\r\n\'Then,\' went on Mark, \'he took us all by surprise by making me this\r\nproposal--to take the management of the estate, and become a kind of\r\nprivate secretary to him.  You know he gets rheumatism on the optic\r\nnerve, and is almost blind at times.  He would give me \xa3300 a year, and\r\ndo up the house at the home farm, rent free.  What do you say to that,\r\nAnnaple?\'\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, then Annaple said: \'Give up the umbrellas!  Oh!\r\nWhat do you think, Mark?\'\r\n\r\n\'My father wishes it,\' said Mark.  \'He would, as he had promised to do,\r\nmake over to me my share of my own mother\'s fortune, and that would, I\r\nhave been reckoning, bring us to just what we had thought of starting\r\nupon this spring at Micklethwayte.\'\r\n\r\n\'The same now,\' said Lady Ronnisglen, after some reckoning, \'but what\r\ndoes it lead to?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well--nothing, I am afraid,\' said Mark; \'as you know, this is all I\r\nhave to reckon upon.  The younger children will have hardly anything\r\nfrom their mother, so that my father\'s means must chiefly go to them.\'\r\n\r\n\'And this agency is entirely dependent on your satisfying Mr. Egremont?\'\r\n\r\n\'True, but that\'s a thing only too easily done.  However, as you say,\r\nthis agency has no future, and if that came to an end, I should only\r\nhave to look out for another or take to farming.\'\r\n\r\n\'And ask poor John if that is a good speculation nowadays!\' said\r\nAnnaple.\r\n\r\n\'Fortunes are and have been made on the umbrellas,\' said Mark.\r\n\'Greenleaf has a place almost equal to Monks Horton, and Dutton, though\r\nhe makes no show, has realised a considerable amount.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, let us stick to the umbrellas!\' cried Annaple; \'you\'ve made\r\nthe plunge, so it does not signify now, and we should be so much more\r\nindependent out of the way of everybody.\'\r\n\r\n\'You would lose in society,\' said Mark, \'excepting, of course, as to\r\nthe Monks Horton people; but they are often away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Begging your pardon, Mark, is there much to lose in this same\r\nneighbourhood?\' laughed Annaple, \'now May will go.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is not so much a question of liking,\' added her mother, \'as of what\r\nis for the best, and where you may wish to be--say ten years hence.\'\r\n\r\nLooked at in this way, there could be no question but that the umbrella\r\ncompany promised to make Mark a richer man in ten years\' time than did\r\nthe agency at Bridgefield Egremont.  He had a salary from the office\r\nalready, and if he purchased shares in the partnership with the portion\r\nhis father would resign to him, his income would already equal what he\r\nwould have at Bridgefield, and there was every prospect of its\r\nincrease, both as he became more valuable, and as the business\r\ncontinued to prosper.  If the descent in life had been a grievance to\r\nthe ladies, the agency would have been an infinite boon, but having\r\nswallowed so much, as Annaple said, they might as well do it in\r\nearnest, and to some purpose.  Perhaps, too, it might be detected that\r\nunder the circumstances Annaple would prefer the living in a small way\r\nout of reach of her sister\'s visible compassion.\r\n\r\nSo the matter was settled, but there was an undercurrent in Mark\'s mind\r\non which he had not entered, namely, that his presence at home might\r\nmake all the difference in that reformation in his uncle\'s habits which\r\nAlice had inaugurated, and left in the hands of others. With him at\r\nhand, there was much more chance of Gregorio\'s being dispensed with,\r\nUrsula\'s authority maintained, little Alwyn well brought up, and the\r\nestate, tenants, and household properly cared for, and then he smiled\r\nat his notion of supposing himself of so much importance.  Had he only\r\nhad himself to consider, Mark would have thought his duty plain; but\r\nwhen he found Miss Ruthven and her mother so entirely averse, he did\r\nnot deem it right to sacrifice them to the doubtful good of his uncle,\r\nnor indeed to put the question before them as so much a matter of\r\nconscience that they should feel bound to consider it in that light.\r\nHe did indeed say, \'Well, that settles it,\' in a tone that led Annaple\r\nto exclaim: \'I do believe you want to drop the umbrellas!\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' he answered, \'it is not that, but my father wished it, and\r\nthought it would be good for my uncle.\'\r\n\r\n\'No doubt,\' said Annaple, \'but he has got a daughter, also a son, and a\r\nbrother, and agents are plentiful, so I can\'t see why all the family\r\nshould dance attendance on him.\'\r\n\r\nLady Ronnisglen, much misdoubting Mr. Egremont\'s style of society, and\r\ndreading that Mark might be dragged into it, added her word, feeling on\r\nher side that it was desirable and just to hinder the family from\r\nsacrificing Mark\'s occupation and worldly interest to a capricious old\r\nroue, who might very possibly throw him over when it would be almost\r\nimpossible to find anything else to do.  Moreover, both she and Annaple\r\nbelieved that the real wish was to rescue the name of Egremont from\r\nassociation with umbrellas, and they held themselves bound to combat\r\nwhat they despised and thought a piece of worldly folly.\r\n\r\nSo Mark rode home, more glad that the decision was actually made than\r\nat the course it had taken.  His father was disappointed, but could not\r\nbut allow that it was the more prudent arrangement; and Mr. Egremont\r\nshowed all the annoyance of a man whose good offer has been rejected.\r\n\r\n\'\'Tis that little giggling Scotch girl!\' he said.  \'Well, we are quit\r\nof her, anyway.  \'Tis a pity that Mark entangled himself with her, and\r\na mother-in-law into the bargain!  I was a fool to expect to get any\r\ngood out of him!\'\r\n\r\nThis was said to his daughter, with whom he was left alone; for Miss\r\nHeadworth could not bear to accept his hospitality a moment longer than\r\nneedful, and besides had been so much shaken in nerves as to suspect\r\nthat an illness was coming on, and hurried home to be nursed by Mary\r\nNugent.  Canon Egremont was obliged to go back to Redcastle to finish\r\nhis residence, and his wife, who had been absent nearly a month from\r\nher family, thought it really wisest to let the father and daughter be\r\nthrown upon one another at once, so that Ursula might have the benefit\r\nof her father\'s softened mood.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt that he was softened, and that he had derived\r\nsome improvement from the year and a half that his wife had been with\r\nhim.  It might not have lifted him up a step, but it had arrested him\r\nin his downward course.  Selfish and indolent he was as ever, but there\r\nhad been a restraint on his amusements, and a withdrawal from his worst\r\nassociates, such as the state of his health might continue, above all\r\nif Gregorio could be dispensed with.  The man himself had become aware\r\nof the combination against him, and, though reckoning on his master\'s\r\ninertness and dependence upon him, knew that a fresh offence might\r\ncomplete his overthrow, and therefore took care to be on his good\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nThus Nuttie\'s task might be somewhat smoothed; but the poor girl felt\r\nunspeakably desolate as she ate her breakfast all alone with a dull\r\npost-bag, and still more so when, having seen the housekeeper, who,\r\nhappily for her, was a good and capable woman, and very sorry for her,\r\nshe had to bethink herself what to do in that dreary sitting-room\r\nduring the hour when she had always been most sure of her\r\nsister-mother\'s dear company.  How often she had grumbled at being\r\ncalled on to practise duets for her father\'s evening lullaby!  She\r\nsupposed she ought to get something up, and she proceeded to turn over\r\nand arrange the music with a sort of sick loathing for whatever was\r\nconnected with those days of impatient murmurs, which she would so\r\ngladly have recalled.  Everything had fallen into disorder, as Blanche\r\nand May had left it the last time they had played there; and the\r\noverlooking it, and putting aside the pieces which she could never use\r\nalone, occupied her till Gregorio, very meek and polite, came with a\r\nmessage that Mr. Egremont would be glad if she would come to his room.\r\nIn some dread, some distaste, and yet some pity and some honest\r\nresolution, she made her way thither.\r\n\r\nThere he sat, in dressing-gown, smoking-cap, and blue spectacles, with\r\nthe glittering February sunshine carefully excluded.  He looked worse\r\nand more haggard than when she had seen him at dinner in the evening,\r\nmade up for company, and her compassion increased, especially as he not\r\nonly held out his hand, but seemed to expect her to kiss him, a thing\r\nshe had never done since their first recognition.  It was not pleasant\r\nin itself, but it betokened full forgiveness, and indeed he had never\r\nspoken to her in his sneering, exasperating voice since her mournful\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\n\'Have you seen the boy?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; they are walking him up and down under the south wall,\' said\r\nNuttie, thankful that she had peeped under the many wraps as he was\r\ncarried across the hall.\r\n\r\n\'Here!  I want you to read this letter to me.  A man ought to be\r\nindicted for writing such a hand!\'\r\n\r\nIt was really distinct penmanship, though minute; but, as Nuttie found,\r\nher father did not like to avow how little available were his eyes.  He\r\ncould write better than he could read, but he kept her over his\r\ncorrespondence for the rest of the morning, answering some of the\r\nletters of condolence for him in her own name, writing those of\r\nbusiness, and folding and addressing what he himself contrived to\r\nwrite.  Her native quickness stood her in good stead, and, being rather\r\nnervous, she took great pains, and seldom stumbled; indeed, she only\r\nonce incurred an exclamation of impatience at her stupidity or slowness.\r\n\r\nShe guessed rightly that this forbearance was owing to tender\r\npersuasions of her mother, and did not guess that a certain fear of\r\nherself was mingled with other motives.  Her father had grown used to\r\nwoman\'s ministrations; he needed them for his precious little heir, and\r\nhe knew his daughter moreover for a severe judge, and did not want to\r\nalienate her and lose her services; so they got on fairly well\r\ntogether, and she shared his luncheon, during which a message came up\r\nabout the carriage; and as there had been an application for some\r\nnursery needment, and moreover black-edged envelopes had run short,\r\nthere was just purpose enough for a drive to the little town.\r\n\r\nThen Nuttie read her father to sleep with the newspaper; rushed round\r\nthe garden in the twilight to stretch her young limbs; tried to read a\r\nlittle, dressed, dined with her father; finished what he had missed in\r\nthe paper, then offered him music, and was told \'if she pleased,\' and\r\nas she played she mused whether this was to be her life.  It looked\r\nvery dull and desolate, and what was the good of it all?  But there\r\nwere her mother\'s words, \'Love him!\'  How fulfil them?  She could pity\r\nhim now, but oh! how could she love one from whom her whole nature\r\nrecoiled, when she thought of her mother\'s ruined life? Mr. Dutton too\r\nhad held her new duties up to her as capable of being ennobled.  Noble!\r\nTo read aloud a sporting paper she did not want to understand, to be\r\nready to play at cards or billiards, to take that dawdling drive day by\r\nday, to devote herself to the selfish exactions of burnt-out\r\ndissipation.  Was this noble?  Her mother had done all this, and never\r\neven felt it a cross, because of her great love.  It must be Nuttie\'s\r\ncross if it was her duty; but could the love and honour possibly come\r\nthough she tried to pray in faith?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE GIGGLING SCOTCH GIRL.\r\n\r\n  \'For every Lamp that trembled here,\r\n  And faded in the night,\r\n  Behold a Star serene and clear\r\n  Smiles on me from the height.\'--B. M.\r\n\r\n\r\nNuttie was not mistaken in supposing that this first day would be a\r\nfair sample of her life, though, of course, after the first weeks of\r\nmourning there were variations; and the return of the Rectory party\r\nmade a good deal of brightening, and relieved her from the necessity of\r\nfinding companionship and conversation for her father on more than half\r\nher afternoons and evenings.\r\n\r\nHe required her, however, almost every forenoon, and depended on her\r\nincreasingly, so that all her arrangements had to be made with\r\nreference to him.  It was bondage, but not as galling in the fact as\r\nshe would have expected if it had been predicted to her a few months\r\npreviously.  In the first place, Mr. Egremont never demanded of her\r\nwhat was actually against her conscience, except occasionally giving up\r\na Sunday evensong to read the paper to him, and that only when he was\r\nmore unwell than usual.  He was, after all, an English gentleman, and\r\ndid not ask his young daughter to read to him the books which her\r\nmother had loathed.  Moreover, Gregorio was on his good behaviour,\r\nperfectly aware that there was a family combination against him, and\r\nhaving even received a sort of warning from his master, but by no means\r\nintending to take it, and therefore abstaining from any kind of offence\r\nthat could furnish a fresh handle against him; and thus for the\r\npresent, Dr. Hammond\'s regimen was well observed, and Mr. Egremont was\r\nhis better self in consequence, for, under his wife\'s guardianship, the\r\nperilous habit had sufficiently lost strength to prevent temper and\r\nspirits from manifestly suffering from abstinence.\r\n\r\nThe first time Nuttie found herself obliged to make any very real\r\nsacrifice to her father\'s will was on the occasion of Mark\'s marriage\r\nat Easter.  Things had arranged themselves very conveniently for him at\r\nMicklethwayte, though it seemed to Nuttie that she only heard of\r\naffairs there in a sort of distant dream, while such events were taking\r\nplace as once would have been to her the greatest possible revolutions.\r\n\r\nAunt Ursel reached home safely, but her expectations of illness were\r\nrealised.  She took to her bed on arriving, and though she rose from\r\nit, there was reason to think she had had a slight stroke, for her\r\nactivity of mind and body were greatly decayed, and she was wholly\r\ndependent on Mary Nugent for care and comfort.  Mary, remembering the\r\nconsequences of the former alarm, made the best of the old lady\'s\r\ncondition; and Nuttie, ashamed of having once cried \'wolf,\' did not\r\nrealise the true state of the case, nor indeed could she or would she\r\nhave been spared to go to Micklethwayte.\r\n\r\nThe next news told that Gerard Godfrey, at the end of the year required\r\nby Mr. Dutton, had resigned his situation, and at the close of his\r\nquarter\'s notice was going to prepare for Holy Orders under the\r\ntraining of a clergyman who would employ him in his parish, and assist\r\nhim in reading up to the requirements for admission to a theological\r\ncollege.  Poor dear old Gerard!  It gave Nuttie a sort of pang of\r\nself-reproach to own how good and devoted he was, and yet so narrow and\r\nstupid that she could never have been happy with him.  Was he too good,\r\nor was he too dull for her?  Had she forsaken him for the world\'s sake,\r\nor was it a sound instinct that had extinguished her fancy for him?  No\r\none could tell, least of all the parties concerned.  He might be far\r\nabove her in spiritual matters, but he was below her in intellectual\r\nones, and though they would always feel for one another that peculiar\r\ntenderness left by the possibilities of a first love, no doubt the\r\nquarrel over the blue ribbon had been no real misfortune to either.\r\n\r\nThe next tidings were still more surprising.  Mr. Dutton was leaving\r\nthe firm.  Though his father had died insolvent, and he had had to\r\nstruggle for himself in early life, he was connected with wealthy\r\npeople, and change and death among these had brought him a fair share\r\nof riches.  An uncle who had emigrated to Australia at the time of the\r\ngreat break up had died without other heirs, leaving him what was the\r\nmore welcome to him that Micklethwayte could never be to him what it\r\nhad been in its golden age.  He had realised enough to enable him to be\r\nbountiful, and his parting gift to St Ambrose\'s would complete the\r\nchurch; but he himself was winding up the partnership, and withdrawing\r\nhis means from Greenleaf and Co. in order to go out to Australia to\r\ndecide what to do with his new possessions.\r\n\r\nMark Egremont purchased a number of the shares, though, to gratify the\r\nfamily, the shelter of the Greenleaf veiled his name under the \'Co.,\'\r\nand another, already in the firm, possessed of a business-like\r\nappellation, gave designation to the firm as Greenleaf, Goodenough, and\r\nCo.\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton\'s well-kept house, with the little conservatory and the\r\nmagnolia, was judged sufficient for present needs, and the lease was\r\ntaken off his hands, so that all was in order for the marriage of Mark\r\nand Annaple immediately after Easter.\r\n\r\nLady Delmar had resigned herself to the inevitable, and the wedding was\r\nto take place at Lescombe.  Nuttie, whose chief relaxation was in\r\nhearing all the pros and cons from May and Blanche, was asked to be one\r\nof the bridesmaids by Annaple, who had come over to the Rectory in a\r\ndroll inscrutable state of mischief, declaring that she had exasperated\r\nJanet to the verge of insanity by declaring that she should have little\r\numbrellas like those in the Persian inscriptions on her cards, and that\r\nMark was to present all the bridesmaids with neat parasols.  If\r\ncrinolines had not been gone out they could have all been dressed\r\nappropriately.  Now they must wear them closely furled.  All this\r\nbanter was hardly liked by May and Blanche, whose little sisters were\r\nlaughed at again for needing the assurance that they were really to\r\nwear white and rowan leaves and berries--the Ronnisglen badge.  Nuttie,\r\nwho had drawn much nearer to May, refrained from relating this part of\r\nthe story at home, but was much disappointed when, on telling her\r\nfather of the request, she was answered at once:\r\n\r\n\'Hein!  The 24th?  You\'ll be in London, and a very good thing too.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are we to go so soon?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  Didn\'t I tell you to take that house in Berkshire Road from the\r\n20th?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not think we were to start so soon.  Is there any particular\r\nreason?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  That Scotch girl ought to have known better than to ask you in\r\nyour deep mourning.  I thought women made a great point of such things.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Jane did not seem to think it wrong,\' said Nuttie, for she really\r\nwished much for consent.  Not only had she grown fond both of Mark and\r\nAnnaple, but she had never been a bridesmaid, and she knew that not\r\nonly the Kirkaldys but Mr. Dutton had been invited; she had even\r\nventured on offering to lodge some of the overflowing guests of the\r\nRectory.\r\n\r\n\'Their heads are all turned by that poverty-stricken Scotch peerage,\'\r\nreturned Mr. Egremont; \'or the Canoness should have more sense of\r\nrespect.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie\'s wishes were so strong that she made one more attempt, \'I need\r\nnot be a bridesmaid.  They would not mind if I wore my black.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should, then!\' said her father curtly.  \'If they don\'t understand\r\nthe proprieties of life, I do.  I won\'t have you have anything to do\r\nwith it.  If you are so set upon gaiety, you\'ll have enough of weddings\r\nat fitter times!\'\r\n\r\nIt was the old sneering tone.  Nuttie felt partly confounded, partly\r\nindignant, and terribly disappointed.  She did care for the sight of\r\nthe wedding--her youthful spirits had rallied enough for that, but far\r\nmore now she grieved at missing the sight of Mr. Dutton, when he was\r\ngoing away, she knew not where, and might perhaps come on purpose to\r\nsee her; and it also made her sore and grieved at being accused of\r\ndisregard to her mother.  She was silenced, however, and presently her\r\nfather observed, in the same unpleasant tone, \'Well, if you\'ve digested\r\nyour disappointment, perhaps you\'ll condescend to write to the agent,\r\nthat I expect the house to be ready on the 21st.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie got through her morning\'s work she hardly knew how, though her\r\nfather was dry and fault-finding all the time.  Her eyes were so full\r\nof tears when she was released that she hardly saw where she was going,\r\nand nearly ran against her aunt, who had just walked into the hall.\r\nMrs. Egremont was too prudent a woman to let her burst out there with\r\nher grievance, but made her come into the tent-room before she\r\nexclaimed, \'He is going to take me away to London; he won\'t let me go\r\nto the wedding.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry for your disappointment,\' said her aunt quietly, \'but I am\r\nold-fashioned enough to be glad that such strong respect and feeling\r\nshould be shown for your dear mother.  I wish Annaple had spoken to me\r\nbefore asking you, and I would have felt the way.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure it is not want of feeling,\' said Nuttie, as her tears broke\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\'I did not say it was,\' returned her aunt, \'but different generations\r\nhave different notions of the mode of showing it; and the present\r\ncertainly errs on the side of neglect of such tokens of mourning.  If I\r\ndid not think that Annaple and her mother are really uncomfortable at\r\nLescombe, I should have told Mark that it was better taste to wait till\r\nthe summer.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I might only have stayed at home--even if I did not go to the\r\nwedding,\' sighed Nuttie, who had only half listened to the Canoness\'s\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n\'Since you do not go, it is much better that you should be out of the\r\nway,\' said Mrs. Egremont.  \'Is your father ready to see me?\'\r\n\r\nSo Nuttie had to submit, though she pouted to herself, feeling\r\ngrievously misjudged, first as if she had been wanting in regard to the\r\nmemory of her mother, who had been so fond of Mark, and so rejoiced in\r\nhis happiness; and then that her vexation was treated as mere love of\r\ngaiety, whereas it really was disappointment at not seeing Mr. Dutton,\r\nthat good, grave, precise old friend, who could not be named in the\r\nsame breath with vanity.  Moreover, she could not help suspecting that\r\nrespect to her mother was after all only a cloak to resentment against\r\nMark and his marriage.\r\n\r\nHowever, she bethought herself that her mother had often been\r\ndisappointed and had borne it cheerfully, and after having done what\r\nAunt Ursel would have called \'grizzling\' in her room for an hour, she\r\nwrote her note to Miss Ruthven and endeavoured to be as usual, feeling\r\nkeenly that there was no mother now to perceive and gratefully commend\r\none of her only too rare efforts for good humour. On other grounds she\r\nwas very sorry to leave Bridgefield.  May had, in her trouble, thawed\r\nto her, and they were becoming really affectionate and intimate\r\ncompanions, by force of propinquity and relationship, as well as of the\r\nviews that May had imbibed from Hugh Condamine.  Moreover Nuttie felt\r\nher aunt\'s watch over the baby a great assistance to her own ignorance.\r\n\r\nHowever the Canoness had resigned to the poor little heir the perfect\r\nand trustworthy nurse, whom Basil had outgrown, and who consented to\r\nthe transfer on condition of having her nursery establishment entirely\r\napart from the rest of the household.  Her reasons were known though\r\nunspoken, namely, that the rejection of one or two valets highly\r\nrecommended had made it plain that there had been no dislodgment of\r\nGregorio.  The strong silent objection to him of all good female\r\nservants was one of the points that told much against him.  Martin and\r\nthe housekeeper just endured him, and stayed on for the present chiefly\r\nbecause their dear lady had actually begged them not to desert her\r\ndaughter if they could help it, at least not at first.\r\n\r\nNuttie bound over her cousins to give her a full account of the\r\nwedding, and both of them wrote to her.  Blanche\'s letter recorded\r\nsundry scattered particulars,--as to how well the rowan-trimmed tulle\r\ndresses looked--how every one was packed into the carriages for the\r\nlong drive--how there had been a triumphal arch erected over the\r\nBluepost Bridge itself, and Annaple nearly choked with laughing at the\r\nappropriateness--how, to her delight, a shower began, and the\r\nprocession out of the church actually cried out for umbrellas--how\r\npapa, when performing the ceremony, could not recollect that the\r\nbride\'s proper name was Annabella, and would dictate it as Anna-Maria,\r\nSir John correcting him each time sotto voce--how Basil and little\r\nHilda Delmar walked together and \'looked like a couple of ducks,\'\r\nwhich, it was to be hoped, was to be taken metaphorically--how\r\ndreadfully hard the ice on the wedding-cake was, so that when Annaple\r\ntried to cut it the knife slipped and a little white dove flew away and\r\nhit May, which everyone said was a grand omen that she would be the\r\nnext bride, while of course Annaple was perfectly helpless with mirth.\r\nEvery one said it was the merriest wedding ever seen, for the bride\'s\r\nonly tears were those of laughter.  What Nuttie really cared for most\r\ncame just at the end, and not much of that. \'Your Mr. Dutton is just\r\ngone.  He got on famously with Hugh Condamine, and I forgot to tell you\r\nthat he has given Mark such a jolly present, a lovely silver\r\ncoffee-pot, just the one thing they wanted, and Lady Delmar said he\r\ndidn\'t look near so like a tradesman as she expected.  I see May is\r\nwriting too, but I don\'t know what you will get out of her, as Hugh\r\nCondamine came for the day.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie, however, had more hopes from May.  Her letter certainly was\r\nfuller of interest, if shorter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'My Dear Nuttie--Blanche has no doubt told you all the externals.  I\r\nsuppose there never was a brighter wedding, for as Annaple keeps her\r\nmother with her, there was no real rending asunder of ties.  Indeed I\r\nalmost wish her excitement did not always show itself in laughing, for\r\nit prevents people from understanding how much there is in her.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Plainly Hugh Condamine had been rather scandalised by the \'giggling\r\nScotch girl.\')\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Dear old Lady Ronnisglen was delightful.  If there were any tears,\r\nthey were hers, and Lady Delmar was very cordial and affectionate. Of\r\ncourse Hugh and Mr. Dutton missed much that one would have liked in a\r\nwedding.  I drove back with them afterwards, and it was very\r\ninteresting to listen to their conversation about church matters. Hugh\r\nis very much struck with your friend; he had heard a good deal about\r\nMicklethwayte before, and says that such a lay worker is perfectly\r\ninvaluable.  It is a great pity that he is not going on in the firm, it\r\nwould make it so much nicer for Mark, but he says he has duties towards\r\nhis new property.  I think he was sorry not to find you at home, but he\r\nplainly never thought it possible you should be at the wedding.  I\r\ndon\'t know whether I ought to tell you this, but I think you ought to\r\nknow it.  There is a lovely new wreath of Eucharis lilies and\r\nmaiden-hair at dear Aunt Alice\'s grave, close against the rails at the\r\nfeet, and Hugh told me that he looked out of his window very early\r\nyesterday morning and saw Mr. Dutton standing there, leaning on the\r\nrail, with his bare head bowed between his hands.  You can\'t think how\r\nit impressed Hugh.  He said he felt reverent towards him all through\r\nthat day, and he was quite angry with Rosalind and Adela for jesting\r\nbecause, when the shower began as we were coming out of church, Mr.\r\nDutton rushed up with an umbrella, being the only person there who had\r\none, I believe.  Hugh says you may be proud of such a friend.  I wish\r\nyou could have seen Hugh.--Your affectionate cousin,\r\n\r\n                                             \'MARGARET EGREMONT.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHREE YEARS LATER.\r\n\r\n  \'There\'s something rotten in the State.\'--Hamlet.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn an east-windy afternoon in March Mary Nugent emerged from the School\r\nof Art, her well-worn portfolio under her arm, thinking how many\r\nsuccessive generations of boys and girls she had drilled through\r\n\'free-hand,\' \'perspective,\' and even \'life\' with an unvarying average\r\nof failure and very moderate success, and how little talent or\r\noriginality had come to the front, though all might be the better for\r\nknowing how to use eyes and fingers.\r\n\r\nOn the whole her interest as well as her diligence did not flag; but a\r\nsense of weariness and monotony would sometimes come after a recurrence\r\nof well-known blunders of her pupils, and she missed the sense of going\r\nhome to refreshment and enjoyment which had once invigorated her.  St.\r\nAmbrose\'s Road had had its golden age, but the brightness had been\r\ndimmed ever since that festival at Monks Horton. One after another of\r\nthe happy old society had dropped away.  The vicar had received\r\npromotion, and she only remained of the former intimates, excepting old\r\nMiss Headworth, who was no longer a companion, but whom affection\r\nforbade her to desert in feeble old age.  Had her thoughts of the old\r\ntimes conjured up a figure belonging to them?  There was the\r\nwell-brushed hat, the natty silk umbrella, the perfect fit of garments,\r\nthe precise turn-out, nay, the curly lion-shaven poodle, with all his\r\nfringes, leaping on her in recognition, and there was that slightly\r\nFrench flourish of the hat, before--with a bounding heart--she met the\r\nhand in an English grasp.\r\n\r\n\'Miss Nugent!\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Dutton!\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought I should meet you here!\'\r\n\r\n\'When did you come?\'\r\n\r\n\'Half an hour ago.  I came down with George Greenleaf, left my things\r\nat the Royal Hotel, and came on to look for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'You will come and spend the evening with us?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you are so good as to ask me.  How is Miss Headworth?\'\r\n\r\n\'Very feeble, very deaf; but she will be delighted to see you.  There\r\nis no fear of her not remembering you, though she was quite lost when\r\nMrs. Egremont came in yesterday.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Egremont!\' he repeated with a little start.\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Mark.  Ah! we have got used to the name--the Honourable Mrs.\r\nEgremont, as the community insist on calling her.  What a sunny\r\ncreature she is!\'\r\n\r\n\'And Miss Egremont, what do you hear of her?\'\r\n\r\n\'She writes long letters, poor child.  I hope she is fairly happy. Are\r\nyou come home for good, or is this only a visit?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have no intention of returning.  I have been winding up my good\r\ncousin\'s affairs at Melbourne.\'\r\n\r\nMary\'s heart bounded again with a sense of joy, comfort, and\r\nprotection; but she did not long keep Mr. Dutton to herself, for every\r\nthird person they met gladly greeted him, and they were long in getting\r\nto St. Ambrose\'s Road, now dominated by a tall and beautiful spire,\r\naccording to the original design.  They turned and looked in at the\r\npillared aisles, stained glass, and handsome reredos.\r\n\r\n\'Very different from our struggling days,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Mary, with half a sigh.  \'There\'s the new vicar,\' as he\r\npassed with a civil nod.  \'He has three curates, and a house of\r\nSisters, and works the parish excellently.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t speak as if you were intimate.\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  His womankind are rather grand--quite out of our beat; and in\r\nparish work I am only an estimable excrescence.  It is very well that I\r\nam not wanted, for Miss Headworth requires a good deal of attention,\r\nand it is only the old Adam that regrets the days of importance.  Ah,\r\ndo you see?\'\r\n\r\nThey were passing Mr. Dutton\'s old home.  On the tiny strip of lawn in\r\nfront was a slender black figure, with yellow hair, under a tiny black\r\nhat, dragging about a wooden horse whereon was mounted a sturdy boy of\r\ntwo, also yellow-locked and in deep mourning under his Holland blouse.\r\n\r\n\'Billy-boy is riding to meet his daddy!\' was merrily called out both by\r\nmother and son before they perceived the stranger.\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Dutton,\' said Mary.\r\n\r\nAnnaple bowed, but did not put out her hand, and such a flush was on\r\nher face that Miss Nugent said, \'I am sure that is too much for you!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no--\' she began; but \'Allow me,\' said Mr. Dutton, and before she\r\ncould refuse he was galloping round and round the little lawn, the boy\r\nscreaming with delight as Monsieur raced with them.\r\n\r\n\'So he is come!\' she said in a low doubtful voice to Mary.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  He has met Mr. Greenleaf in London.  I always think he has the\r\ncontrary to the evil eye.  Whatever he takes in hand rights itself.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll hope so.  Oh, thank you!  Billy-boy, say thank you!  What a ride\r\nyou have had!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why are they in such deep mourning?\' asked Mr. Dutton, after they had\r\nparted.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, did you not know? for good old Lady Ronnisglen.  She had a bad\r\nfall about two years ago, and never left her bed again; and this last\r\nautumn she sank away.\'\r\n\r\n\'They have had a great deal of trouble, then.  I saw the death of Canon\r\nEgremont in the Times soon after I went out to Australia.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; he had heart disease, and died quite suddenly.  The living is\r\ngiven to Mr. Condamine, who married the eldest daughter, and the widow\r\nis gone to live under the shadow of Redcastle Cathedral.\'\r\n\r\nTherewith Miss Nugent opened her own door, and Miss Headworth was soon\r\nmade aware of the visitor.  She was greatly changed, and had the\r\nindescribable stony look that tells of paralysis; and though she knew\r\nMr. Dutton, and was delighted to see him, his presence made her expect\r\nto see Alice and Nuttie come in, though she soon recollected herself\r\nand shed a few helpless tears.  Then--in another mood--she began to\r\ndisplay with pride and pleasure the photographs of \'Alice\'s dear little\r\nboy.\'  She had a whole series of them, from the long-clothed babe on\r\nhis sister\'s knee to the bright little fellow holding a drum--a very\r\nbeautiful child, with a striking resemblance to his mother, quite\r\nstartling to Mr. Dutton, especially in the last, which was coloured,\r\nand showed the likeness of eyes and expression.\r\n\r\n\'Nuttie always sends me one whenever he is taken,\' said the old lady.\r\n\'Dear Nuttie!  It is very good for her.  She is quite a little mother\r\nto him.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was sure it would be so,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Mary, \'he is the great interest and delight of her life.\r\nHer letters are full of his little sayings and doings.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is she at home now?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; at Brighton.  Her father seems to have taken a dislike to\r\nBridgefield since his brother\'s death, and only goes there for a short\r\ntime in the shooting season.  He has taken a lease of a house in\r\nLondon, and spends most of the year there.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' as she showed him the address, \'that is near the old house where\r\nI used to stay with my grand-aunt.  We thought it altogether in the\r\ncountry then, but it is quite absorbed now, and I have dazzling offers\r\nfrom building companies for the few acres of ground around it. Have you\r\nseen her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no; I believe she is quite necessary to her father.  I only hear of\r\nher through Lady Kirkaldy, who has been very kind to her, but, I am\r\nsorry to say, is now gone with her Lord to the East.  She says she\r\nthinks that responsibility has been very good for Nuttie; she is\r\ngentler and less impetuous, and a good deal softened by her affection\r\nfor the child.\'\r\n\r\n\'She was certain to develop.  I only dreaded what society her father\r\nmight surround her with.\'\r\n\r\n\'Lady Kirkaldy says that all has turned out better than could have been\r\nexpected.  You see, as she says, Mr. Egremont has been used to good\r\nwomen in his own family, and would not like to see her in a slangy fast\r\nset.  All her own gaieties have been under Lady Kirkaldy\'s wing, or\r\nthat of Mrs. William Egremont\'s relations, and only in a quiet moderate\r\nway.  Her father gets his own old set about him, and they have not been\r\nvery choice, but they are mostly elderly men, and gentlemen, and know\r\nhow to behave themselves to her. Indeed, her cousin Blanche, who was\r\nhere in the winter, gave us to understand that Ursula knows how to take\r\ncare of herself, and gets laughed at as rather an old maidish model of\r\npropriety, if you can believe it of your little Nuttie.\'\r\n\r\n\'I could quite believe in her on the defensive, unprotected as she is.\'\r\n\r\n\'What did that young lady--Miss Blanche--tell us about that gentleman,\r\nMary?\' asked Miss Headworth, hearing and uttering what Miss Nugent\r\nhoped had passed unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I think that was all gossip!\' returned Mary, \'and so I am sure did\r\nthe Mark Egremonts.  She said there was one of Mr. Egremont\'s friends,\r\nMr. Clarence Fane, I think she called him, rather younger than the\r\nothers, who, she was pleased to say, seemed smitten with Nuttie, but I\r\nhave heard nothing more about it, and Mrs. Mark scouted the idea,\' she\r\nadded in haste, as she saw his expression vary in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\'Do you see much of your neighbours?\'\r\n\r\n\'We are both too busy to see much of one another, but we have our\r\nlittle talks over the wall.  What a buoyant creature she is.  It seems\r\nas if playfulness was really a sustaining power in her, helping her to\r\nget diversion out of much that others might stumble at.  You know\r\nperhaps that when she arrived the work-people had got up a beautiful\r\nparasol for her, white, with a deep fringe and spray of rowan.  Little\r\nSusie Gunner presented her with it, and she was very gracious and nice\r\nabout it.  But then what must Mr. Goodenough do but dub it the\r\nAnnabella sunshade, and blazon it, considerably vulgarised, in all the\r\nrailway stations, and magazines.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know!  I had the misfortune to see it in the station at Melbourne;\r\nand my mind misgave me from that hour.\'\r\n\r\n\'Her husband was prepared to be very angry, but she fairly laughed him\r\nout of it, made all sorts of fun out of the affair, declared it her\r\nonly opening to fame, and turned it into a regular joke; so that indeed\r\nthe Greenleafs, who were vexed at the matter, and tried to apologise,\r\nwere quite perplexed in their turn, and not at all sure that the whole\r\nconcern was not being turned into ridicule.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder it did not make him cut the connection,\' said Mr. Dutton,\r\nmuttering \'I only wish it had.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Greenleaf is very funny about her, \'added Mary, \'proud of the\r\nHonourable Mrs. Egremont, as they insist on calling her, yet not quite\r\npleased that she should be the junior partner\'s wife; and decidedly\r\nresenting her hardly going into society at all, though I really don\'t\r\nsee how she could; for first there was the Canon\'s death, and then just\r\nafter the boy was born came Lady Ronnisglen\'s accident, and for the\r\nnext year and a half there was constant attendance on her.  They fitted\r\nup a room on the ground floor for her, the one opening into your\r\ndrawing-room, and there they used to sit with her.  I used to hear them\r\nreading to her and singing to her, and they were always as merry as\r\npossible, till last autumn, when something brought on erysipelas, and\r\nshe was gone almost before they took alarm.  The good little daughter\r\nwas beaten down then, really ill for a week; but if you can understand\r\nme, the shock seemed to tell on her chiefly bodily, and though she was\r\nhalf broken-hearted when her husband in a great fright brought me up to\r\nsee her, and say whether her sister should be sent for, she still made\r\nfun of him, and described the impossible advice they would bring on\r\nthemselves.  I had to take care of her while he went away to the\r\nfuneral in Scotland, and then I learnt indeed to like her and see how\r\nmuch there is in her besides laughter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did the old lady leave them anything?\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe she had nothing to leave.  Her jointure was not much, but I\r\nam sure they miss that, for Mrs. Egremont has parted with her nurse,\r\nand has only a little girl in her stead, driving out the perambulator\r\noften herself, to the great scandal of the Greenleafs, though she would\r\nhave one believe it is all for want of occupation.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think they have taken any alarm?\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no judging from her joyous surface, but I have thought him\r\nlooking more careworn and anxious than I liked.  Mr. Dutton, don\'t\r\nanswer if I ought not to ask, but is it true that things are going\r\nwrong?  I know you have been seeing Mr. Greenleaf, so perhaps you are\r\nin his confidence and cannot speak.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tell me, what is known or suspected?\'\r\n\r\n\'Just this, that Mr. Goodenough has been the ruin of the concern.  He\r\nhas been quite different ever since his voyage to America.  You were\r\ngone, old Mr. Greenleaf has been past attending to business ever since\r\nhe had that attack, and George Greenleaf has been playing the country\r\nsquire at Horton Bishop, and not looking after the office work, and Mr.\r\nEgremont was inexperienced.  One could see, of course, that the whole\r\ncharacter of the business was changed--much more advertising, much more\r\ncheap and flashy work--to be even with the times, it was said, but the\r\nold superior hands were in despair at the materials supplied to them,\r\nand the scamped work expected.  You should have heard old Thorpe\r\nmourning for you, and moralising over the wickedness of this world.\r\nHis wife told me she really thought he would go melancholy mad if he\r\ndid not leave the factory, and he has done so.  They have saved enough\r\nto set up a nice little shop at Monks Horton.\'\r\n\r\n\'I must go and see them!  Good old Thorpe!  I ought never to have put\r\nthose poor young things into the firm when I ceased to have any control\r\nover it.  I shall never forgive myself--\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing could seem safer then!  No one could have guessed that young\r\nMr. Greenleaf would be so careless without his father to keep him up to\r\nthe mark, nor that Mr. Goodenough should alter so much.  Is it very\r\nbad?  Is there worse behind?  Speculation, I suppose--\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course.  I do not see to the bottom of it yet; poor George seemed\r\nto reckon on me for an advance, but I am afraid this is more than a\r\nmere temporary depression, such as may be tided over, and that all that\r\ncan be looked to is trying to save honourable names by an utter break\r\nup, which may rid them of that--that--no, I won\'t call him a scoundrel.\r\nI thought highly of him once, and no doubt he never realised what he\r\nwas doing.\'\r\n\r\nBefore the evening was far advanced Mark Egremont knocked at the door,\r\nand courteously asked whether Mr. Dutton could be spared to him for a\r\nlittle while.  Mary Nugent replied that she was just going to help Miss\r\nHeadworth to bed, and that the parlour was at their service for a\r\nprivate interview, but Mark answered, \'My wife is anxious to hear.  She\r\nknows all that I do, and is quite prepared to hear whatever Mr. Dutton\r\nmay not object to saying before her.\'\r\n\r\nSo they bade good-night to Mary, and went on together to the next\r\nhouse, Mr. Dutton saying \'You have much to forgive me, Mr. Egremont; I\r\nfeel as if I had deserted the ship just as I had induced you to embark\r\nin it.\'\r\n\r\n\'You did not guess how ill it would be steered without you,\' returned\r\nMark, with a sigh.  \'Do not fear to speak out before my wife, even if\r\nwe are sinking.  She will hear it bravely, and smile to the last.\'\r\n\r\nThe room which Mr. Dutton entered was not like the cabin of a sinking\r\nship, nor, as in his own time, like the well-ordered apartment of a\r\nbachelor of taste.  Indeed, the house was a great puzzle to Monsieur,\r\nwho entered by invitation, knowing his way perfectly, thinking himself\r\nat home after all his travels, and then missing his own particular mat,\r\nand sniffing round at the furniture.  It was of the modified aesthetic\r\ndate, but arranged more with a view to comfort than anything else, and\r\nby the light of the shaded lamp and bright fire was pre-eminently\r\nhome-like, with the three chairs placed round the hearth, and\r\nbright-haired Annaple rising up from the lowest with her knitting to\r\ngreet Mr. Dutton, and find a comfortable lair for Monsieur.\r\n\r\n\'Miss Nugent says that you set everything right that you do but look\r\nat, Mr. Dutton,\' she said; \'so we are prepared to receive you as a good\r\ngenius to help us out of our tangle.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton was afraid that the tangle was far past unwinding, and of\r\ncourse the details, so far as yet known, were discussed.  There was, in\r\ntruth, nothing for which Mark could be blamed.  He had diligently\r\nattended to his office-work, which was mere routine, and, conscious of\r\nhis own inexperience, and trusting to the senior partners, he had only\r\nbecome anxious at the end of the year, when he perceived Goodenough\'s\r\navoidance of a settlement of accounts, and detected shuffling.  He had\r\nnot understood enough of the previous business to be aware of the\r\ndeterioration of the manner of dealing with it, though he did think it\r\nscarcely what he expected.  If he had erred, it was in acting too much\r\nas a wheel in the machinery, keeping his thoughts and heart in his own\r\nhappy little home, and not throwing himself into the spirit of the\r\nbusiness, or the ways of those concerned in it, so that he had been in\r\nno degree a controlling power.  He had allowed his quality of gentleman\r\nto keep him an outsider, instead of using it to raise the general level\r\nof the transactions, so that the whole had gone down in the hands of\r\nthe unscrupulous Goodenough.\r\n\r\nAnnaple listened and knitted quietly while the affairs were explained\r\non either hand.  Mark had had one serious talk with George Greenleaf,\r\nand both had had a stormy scene with Goodenough.  Then Mr. Dutton had\r\ntelegraphed his arrival, and Greenleaf had met him in London, with\r\nhopes, bred of long and implicit trust, that his sagacity and perhaps\r\nhis wealth would carry the old house through the crisis.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Dutton, though reserving his judgment till the books should\r\nhave been thoroughly examined and the liabilities completely\r\nunderstood, was evidently inclined to believe that things had gone too\r\nfar, and that the names of Greenleaf and Egremont could only be\r\npreserved from actual dishonour by going into liquidation, dissolving\r\npartnership, and thus getting quit of Goodenough.\r\n\r\nMark listened resignedly, Annaple with an intelligence that made Mr.\r\nDutton think her the more clearheaded of the two, though still she\r\ncould not refrain from her little jokes.  \'I\'m sure I should not mind\r\nhow liquid we became if we could only run off clear of Goodenough,\' she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\'You know what it means?\' said her husband.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, I know what it means.  It is the fine word for being sold up.\r\nWell, Mark, never mind, we are young and strong, and it will not be a\r\nbit the worse for the Billy-boy in the end to begin at the bottom of\r\neverything.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope--may I ask--is everything embarked in the poor old firm?\' said\r\nMr. Dutton with some hesitation.\r\n\r\n\'All that is mine,\' said Mark, with his elbow on the table and his chin\r\non his hand.\r\n\r\n\'But I\'ve got a hundred a year, charged on poor old Ronnisglen\'s\r\nestate,\' said Annaple.  \'All the others gave theirs up when they\r\nmarried, and I wanted to do so, but my dear mother would not let me;\r\nshe said I had better try how I got on first.  Think of that, Mark, a\r\nhundred a year!  Why, old Gunner or Thorpe would think themselves\r\nrolling in riches if they only heard that they had a hundred a year!\'\r\n\r\n\'You won\'t find it go far!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I shall, for I shall make you live on porridge, with now and then\r\na sheep\'s head for a treat!  Besides, there will be something to do.\r\nIt will be working up again, you know.  But seriously, Mr. Dutton, I\r\nhave some things here of my dear mother\'s that really belong to\r\nRonnisglen, and I was only keeping till he comes home. Should not they\r\nbe got out of the way?\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, we are not come to that yet!  I hope it may be averted!\'\r\ncried Mark.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Dutton agreed with the young wife that it would be much better\r\nto send these things away before their going could excite suspicion.\r\nThere was only a tiny silver saucepan, valued as a gift of \'Queen\'\r\nClementina to an ancestress, also a silver teapot and some old point,\r\nand some not very valuable jewellery, all well able to go into a small\r\nbox, which Mr. Dutton undertook to deposit with Lord Ronnisglen\'s\r\nbankers.  He was struck with the scrupulous veracity with which Annaple\r\ndecided between what had become her own property and the heirlooms,\r\nthough what she claimed might probably be sacrificed to the creditors.\r\n\r\nMark could hardly endure to see what made the crisis so terribly real.\r\n\'That I should have brought you to this!\' he said to his wife, when\r\ntheir visitor had at length bidden them good-night.\r\n\r\n\'If we begin at that work,\' said Annaple, \'it was I who brought you! I\r\nhave often thought since it was rather selfish not to have consented to\r\nyour helping poor Ursula with her heavy handful of a father!  It was\r\nall money grubbing and grabbing, you see, and if we had thought more of\r\nour neighbour than ourselves we might have been luxuriating at the Home\r\nFarm, or even if your uncle had quarrelled with you, he would not have\r\ndevoured your substance.  I have thought so often, ever since I began\r\nto see this coming.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear child, you don\'t mean that you have seen this coming!\'\r\n\r\n\'My prophetic soul!  Why, Mark, you have as good as inferred it over\r\nand over again.  I\'ve felt like scratching that Badenough whenever I\r\nmet him in the street.  I must indulge myself by calling him so for\r\nonce in strict privacy.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have guessed it all the time, while I only thought how unconscious\r\nyou were.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not to say stupid, considering all you told me.  Besides, what would\r\nhave been the use of howling and moaning and being dismal before the\r\ntime?  For my part, I could clap my hands even now at getting rid of\r\nGoodenough, and his jaunty, gracious air!  Come, Mark, it won\'t be so\r\nbad after all, you\'ll see.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing can be "so bad," while you are what you are, my Nan.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s right.  While we have each other and the Billy-boy, nothing\r\nmatters much.  There\'s plenty of work in us both, and that good man\r\nwill find it for us; or if he doesn\'t, we\'ll get a yellow van, and knit\r\nstockings, and sell them round the country.  How jolly that would be!\r\nImagine Janet\'s face.  There, that\'s right,\' as her mimicry evoked a\r\nsmile, \'I should be ashamed to be unhappy about this, when our good\r\nname is saved, and when there is a blessing on the poor,\' she added in\r\na lower voice, tenderly kissing her husband\'s weary brow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE BOY OF EGREMONT.\r\n\r\n  \'And the boy that walked beside me,\r\n  He could not understand\r\n  Why, closer in mine, ah, closer,\r\n  I press\'d his warm soft hand.\'--LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agony of a firm like Greenleaf, Goodenough, and Co. could not be a\r\nrapid thing, and Mr. Dutton lived between London and Micklethwayte for\r\nseveral weeks, having much to endure on all sides.  The senior partners\r\nthought it an almost malicious and decidedly ungrateful thing in him\r\nnot to throw in his means, or at any rate, offer his guarantee to tide\r\nthem over their difficulties.  Goodenough\'s tergiversations and\r\nconcealments needed a practised hand and acute head to unravel them,\r\nand often deceived Mr. Greenleaf himself; and when, for a time, he was\r\nconvinced that the whole state was so rotten that a crash was\r\ninevitable, his wife\'s lamentations and complaints of Mr. Dutton would\r\nundo the whole, and it was as if he were doing them an injury that the\r\npair accepted the comfortable prospect he was able to offer them in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nHe would have made the like proposal to the Egremonts, but found that\r\nMark held himself bound by his promise to his father not to emigrate,\r\nand thought of some kind of office-work.  Before trying to procure this\r\nfor him, however, Mr. Dutton intended to see his uncle, and try whether\r\nthe agency, once rejected, could still be obtained for him. Learning\r\nfrom Miss Nugent that the Egremonts were in town, he went up thither\r\nwith the purpose of asking for an interview.\r\n\r\nThere was a new church in the immediate neighbourhood of his house in a\r\nstate of growth and development congenial to the St. Ambrose trained\r\nmind, and here Mr. Dutton, after old Micklethwayte custom, was\r\nattending the early matins, when, in the alternate verses of the psalm,\r\nhe heard a fresh young voice that seemed to renew those days gone by,\r\nand looking across the central aisle his eyes met a pair of dark ones\r\nwhich gave a sudden glitter of gladness at the encounter. That was all\r\nhe saw or cared to see.  He did not take in the finished completeness\r\nof the very plain dark dress and hat, nor the womanly air of the little\r\nfigure, until they clasped hands in the porch, and in the old tones\r\nNuttie exclaimed:  \'I\'ve been hoping you would come to London.  How is\r\nMonsieur?\'\r\n\r\n\'In high health, thank you, the darling of the steamer both going and\r\ncoming.  I hope your charges are well?\'\r\n\r\n\'My father is tolerable, just as usual, and my little Alwyn is getting\r\nmore delicious every day.  He will be so delighted to see Monsieur.  I\r\nhave told him so many stories about him!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think I may call on Mr. Egremont?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh do!  He is ready to be called on between two and three, and we\r\nalways have Wynnie downstairs then, so that you will see him too. And\r\nyou have been at Micklethwayte.  I am afraid you found a great change\r\nin Aunt Ursel.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; but she is very peaceful and happy.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I have to leave her altogether to dear excellent Miss Nugent. It\r\nseems very, very wrong, but I cannot help it!  And how about Mark and\r\nAnnaple?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think she is the bravest woman I ever met.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then things are really going badly with the dear old firm?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am hoping to talk to Mr. Egremont about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\'\r\n\r\nNuttie paused.  Towards Mr. Dutton she always had a stronger impulse of\r\nconfidence than towards any one else she had ever met; but she felt\r\nthat he might think it unbecoming to say that she had perceived a\r\ncertain dislike on her father\'s part towards Mark ever since the\r\nrejection of the agency and the marriage, which perhaps was regarded as\r\na rejection of herself.  He had a habit of dependence on Mark, which\r\nresulted in personal liking, when in actual contact, but in absence the\r\ndistaste and offence always revived, fostered, no doubt, by Gregorio;\r\nand Canon Egremont\'s death had broken the link which had brought them\r\ntogether.  However, for his brother\'s sake, and for the sake of the\r\nname, the head of the family might be willing to do something.  It was\r\none of Nuttie\'s difficulties that she never could calculate on the way\r\nher father would take any matter.  Whether for better or for worse, he\r\nalways seemed to decide in diametrical opposition to her expectation.\r\nAnd, as she was certainly less impetuous and more dutiful, she parted\r\nwith Mr. Dutton at her own door without any such hint.\r\n\r\nThese three years had been discipline such as the tenderest, wisest\r\nhand could not have given her, though it had been insensible.  She had\r\nbeen obliged to attend to her father and watch over her little brother,\r\nand though neither task had seemed congenial to her disposition, the\r\nhonest endeavour to do them rightly had produced the affection born of\r\nsolicitude towards her father, and the strong warm tenderness of the\r\ntrue mother-sister towards little Alwyn.\r\n\r\nUrsula Egremont was one of those natures to which responsibility is the\r\nbest training.  If she had had any one to guard or restrain her, she\r\nmight have gone to the utmost limits before she yielded to the curb.\r\nAs it was, she had to take care of herself, to bear and forbear with\r\nher father, to walk warily with her household, and to be very guarded\r\nwith the society into which she was thrown from time to time.  It was\r\nno sudden change, but one brought about by experience. An outbreak of\r\nimpatience or temper towards her father was sure to be followed by his\r\ngalling sneer, or by some mortification to her desires; any act of\r\nmismanagement towards the servants brought its own punishment; and if\r\nshe was tempted by girlish spirits to relax the quiet, stiff courtesy\r\nwhich she observed towards her father\'s guests, there followed jests,\r\nor semi-patronage, or a tone of conversation that offended her, and\r\nmade her repent it.  Happily, Mr. Egremont did not wish her to be\r\notherwise.  One day, when she had been betrayed into rattling and\r\ngiggling, he spoke to her afterwards with a cutting irony which\r\nbitterly angered her at the moment, and which she never forgot.  Each\r\nirksome duty, each privation, each disappointment, each recurrence of\r\nthe sweeping sense of desolation and loneliness had had one effect--it\r\nhad sent her to her knees.  She had no one else to go to.  She turned\r\nto her Father in heaven. Sometimes, indeed, it was in murmuring and\r\ncomplaint at her lot, but still it was to Him and Him alone, and\r\nrepentance sooner or later came to aid her, while refreshments sprang\r\nup around her--little successes, small achievements, pleasant hours,\r\ntokens that her father was pleased or satisfied, and above all, the\r\ngrowing charms of little Alwyn.\r\n\r\nThe special grievance, Gregorio\'s influence, had scarcely dwelt on her\r\nat first as it had done on her mother.  The man had been very cautious\r\nfor some time, knowing that his continuance in his situation was in the\r\nutmost jeopardy, and Mr. Egremont had, in the freshness of his grief\r\nfor his wife, abstained from relapsing into the habits from which she\r\nhad weaned him.  When, however, the Canon was dead, and his son at a\r\ndistance, Gregorio began to feel more secure, and in the restless\r\nsorrow of his master over the blow that had taken away an only brother,\r\nhe administered soothing drugs under another name, so that Ursula, in\r\nher inexperience, did not detect what was going on, and still fancied\r\nthat the habit had been renounced.  All she did know was that it was\r\nentirely useless for her to attempt to exert any authority over the\r\nvalet, and that the only way to escape insolently polite disobedience\r\nwas to let him alone.  Moreover, plans to which her father had agreed,\r\nwhen broached by her, had often been overthrown after his valet had\r\nbeen with him.  It was a life full of care and disappointment, yet\r\nthere was a certain spring of trust that kept Ursula\'s youth from being\r\ndimmed, and enabled her to get a fair share of happiness out of it,\r\nthough she was very sorry not to be more at Bridgefield, where she\r\ncould have worked with all her heart with May Condamine.  Moreover,\r\nLady Kirkaldy\'s absence from London was a great loss to her, for there\r\nwas no one who was so kind or so available in taking her into society;\r\nand Nuttie, though mistress of her father\'s house, was not yet\r\ntwenty-two, and strongly felt that she must keep within careful bounds,\r\nand not attempt to be her own chaperon.\r\n\r\nBut the very sight of her old friend, and the knowledge that he was in\r\nthe neighbourhood, filled her heart with gladness, and seemed like a\r\ncompensation for everything.  Mr. Egremont was in a gracious mood, and\r\nreadily consented to see Mr. Dutton--the friend who had been so\r\npleasant and helpful at Paris--and Nuttie gave her private instructions\r\nto the footman to insure his admittance.\r\n\r\nHis card was brought in just as the father and daughter were finishing\r\nluncheon, and he was received in Mr. Egremont\'s sitting-room, where the\r\nfirst civilities had hardly passed before the door was opened, and in\r\ntrotted the golden-haired boy, so beautiful a child that it would have\r\nbeen impossible not to look at him with delight, even for those to whom\r\nhis dark eyes and sweet smile did not recall those that had once been\r\nso dear.\r\n\r\nMr. Egremont\'s voice took a fresh tone: \'Ah! here he comes, the old\r\nfellow\'--and he held out his hands; but the boy was intent on his own\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s black doggie?\' he asked in a silver-bell of a little voice,\r\nbut lisping a good deal; \'Wyn got penny for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wynnie must be a good boy.  Kiss papa first, and Mr. Dutton,\'\r\nremonstrated the sister; and Alwyn obeyed so far as to submit to his\r\nfather\'s embrace, and then raising those velvety eyes to the visitor\'s\r\nface, he repeated: \'Where black doggie?  Wyn want to see him buy bun.\'\r\n\r\n\'There! your fame has preceded you,\' said Mr. Egremont, \'or rather your\r\ndog\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'You shall see him,\' said Mr. Dutton, taking the pretty boy almost\r\nreverently on his knee, \'but he is at home now.  I could not leave him\r\nout on the street, and I did not know if I might bring him in.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Mr. Dutton! as if Monsieur would not be welcome,\' cried the Nuttie\r\nof old times.  \'I only wish I had stipulated for him, dear old fellow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wyn want to see him,\' reiterated the child.\r\n\r\n\'May I take him to see the performance?\' said Mr. Dutton.  \'I live only\r\nat the corner of Berkshire Road, and there\'s a dairy just opposite\r\nwhere Monsieur has been allowed to keep up his accomplishment.\'\r\n\r\nAlwyn\'s legs, arms, and voice, were all excitement and entreaty; and\r\nMr. Egremont himself proposed that they should all come and witness the\r\nfeat; so Nuttie, in great glee, climbed the stairs with her little\r\nbrother to get ready; and when she came down again, found the gentlemen\r\ndeep, not in Mark Egremont\'s umbrellas, but in the gas and smoke\r\ngrievances which had arisen since the lease of the house had been\r\ntaken, and in which sympathy might be expected from a fellow-inhabitant\r\nof the district.  Little Alwyn was, however, plainly the lord of the\r\nascendant, and unused to see anything else attended to in his presence.\r\nHe took possession of Mr. Dutton\'s hand, and his tongue went fast, nor\r\ndid his father or sister seem to desire any better music.  They reached\r\nan old-walled garden, with lilac and laburnum and horse-chestnut\r\nblossoming above, and showing a mass of greenery through the iron\r\nrailing that surmounted, the low wall on the street side, where Mr.\r\nDutton halted and took out his key.\r\n\r\n\'Is this yours?\' exclaimed Nuttie, \'I have so often wondered whose it\r\ncould be.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, it was a country-house when I was of the age of this little man,\r\nthough you might not think it.\'\r\n\r\n\'The increase of London had not been on that side,\' said Mr. Egremont.\r\n\'This must be a very valuable property!\'\r\n\r\nAnd Nuttie perceived that such an inheritance made Mr. Dutton much more\r\nin his eyes than an ex-umbrella-monger; but no sooner was the tall iron\r\ngate opened than Monsieur, beautifully shaved, with all his curly tufts\r\nin perfection, came bounding to meet his master, and Alwyn had his arms\r\nround the neck in a moment.  Monsieur had in his time been introduced\r\nto too many children not to understand the situation, and respond\r\npolitely; and he also recognised Ursula, and gave unmistakable proofs\r\nof being glad to see her.\r\n\r\nThen the halfpenny was presented to him.  He wagged his queer tail,\r\nsmiled with his intelligent brown eyes, took it between his teeth, and\r\ntrotted across the street in the most business-like way, the others\r\nfollowing, but detaining the boy from keeping too close. They found the\r\ncreature sitting upright, tapping the floor with his tail, the centre\r\nof rapturous admiration to all the customers already in the dairy shop.\r\nHe received his bun, and demurely dropping on his front legs, walked\r\nback with it to his master, and crossed the road with it uneaten,\r\nrather to Alwyn\'s disappointment, but Mr. Dutton said he would probably\r\ndispose of it in some hiding-place in the garden until his evening\r\nappetite came on.  It was well he was a dog of moderation, for there\r\nwas great temptation to repeat the entertainment more than was\r\nwholesome for him.\r\n\r\n\'There, Wynnie,\' said Nuttie in a voice of monition, \'Monsieur doesn\'t\r\neat all his goodies at once, he keeps them for bedtime.\'\r\n\r\nIt might be perceived that the over-supply of sweets was a matter of\r\nanxiety to the elder sister.  To the nurse, who waited in readiness,\r\nAlwyn was consigned for his walk, while his father and sister accepted\r\nMr. Dutton\'s invitation to look round his domain.  It would have been\r\nsmall in the country, but it was extensive for the locality, and there\r\nwas a perfect order and trimness about the shaven lawn, the little\r\nfountain in the midst, the flower-beds gay with pansies,\r\nforget-me-nots, and other early beauties, and the freshly-rolled gravel\r\npaths, that made Nuttie exclaim: \'Ah! I should have known this for\r\nyours anywhere.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not had much to do to it,\' he said.  \'My old aunts had it well\r\nkept up, even when they could only see it from their windows. Their old\r\ngardener still lives in the cottage behind the tool-house, though he is\r\ntoo infirm for anything but being wheeled about in the sun in their\r\nBath-chair.\'\r\n\r\n\'You keep a large amount lying idle by retaining it as it is,\' said Mr.\r\nEgremont.\r\n\r\n\'True, but it is well to preserve an oasis here and there.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie knew well that it was not for himself alone, and as they entered\r\nthe little conservatory, and her eye fell on the row of white\r\nhyacinths, the very scent carried her back to the old times, and her\r\neyes grew moist while Mr. Dutton was cutting a bouquet for her in\r\naccordance with well-known tastes.\r\n\r\n\'I shall put them in my room.  It will feel like home,\' she said, and\r\nthen she saw that she had said what her father did not like; for he was\r\nalways sensitive as to any reference to her early life.\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton, however, took this opportunity of saying that he had been\r\nbackwards and forwards to Micklethwayte several times this spring.\r\n\r\n\'I hope you are well out of the concern there,\' said Mr. Egremont.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, sir; I have no share in it at present.\'\r\n\r\n\'So much the better!\'\r\n\r\n\'But I am very anxious about my friends.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\'  But Mr. Egremont\'s attention was drawn off at the entrance of\r\nthe house by a new-fashioned stove of which Mr. Dutton did the honours,\r\nconducting father and daughter into the drawing-room, where obvious\r\ntraces of the old ladies remained, and thence into his own\r\nsitting-room, smelling pleasantly of Russia leather, and recalling that\r\ninto which Nuttie had been wont, before her schooldays, to climb by the\r\nwindow, and become entranced by the illustrations of a wonderful old\r\nedition of Telemaque, picked up at Paris.\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton made them sit and rest, for this had been a good deal of\r\nexercise for Mr. Egremont; coffee was brought in, having been ordered\r\non their arrival, and therewith Mr. Dutton entered on an exposition of\r\nthe affairs of Greenleaf and Goodenough, which was listened to with a\r\ngood deal of interest, though Nuttie could not quite detect whether it\r\nwere altogether friendly interests in Mark\'s misfortunes, or if there\r\nwere not a certain triumph in the young man having run into trouble by\r\nrejecting his offer.\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton explained that his present object was to induce the friends\r\nof the family to prevent annoyance by preserving the furniture and\r\npersonals at a valuation; and Mr. Egremont readily agreed to contribute\r\nto doing this, though he said the sisters and stepmother were well able\r\nalso to do their share.\r\n\r\n\'And then to give the young people a fresh start,\' added Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'There are some men who are always wanting fresh starts,\' said Mr.\r\nEgremont, \'just as there are some vessels that are always unlucky. And\r\nif you observe, it is just those men who are in the greatest haste to\r\nhang an expensive wife and family round their necks.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think poor Annaple can be accused of being expensive, papa,\'\r\nsaid Nuttie.  \'Only think, when Wynnie has two nurses always after him,\r\nher Willie has only the fraction of a little maid, who does all sorts\r\nof work besides.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I never saw more resolute and cheerful exertion than Mrs. Mark\r\nEgremont\'s,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'She owes him something,\' said Mr. Egremont, \'for she has been the ruin\r\nof him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of his worldly prospects in one sense,\' said Mr. Dutton quietly; while\r\nNuttie felt how much better and wiser an answer it was than the\r\nindignant denial that trembled on her tongue.  \'There can be no doubt\r\nthat they made a grievous mistake in their choice, and I unfortunately\r\nwas concerned in leading them into it; but no one can see how they meet\r\ntheir troubles without great respect and admiration, and I am\r\nespecially bound to seek for some new opening for them.  I have little\r\ndoubt that some office work might be found for him in London, but they\r\nare essentially country people, and it would be much better for them if\r\nhe could have some agency.  I suppose the situation you offered him\r\nbefore, sir, is filled up?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not really,\' cried Nuttie.  \'We have only a very common sort of\r\nuneducated bailiff, who would be much better with some one over him.\r\nYou said so, papa.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did he request you to apply to me?\' said Mr. Egremont sharply, looking\r\nat Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Neither he nor she has the least idea of my intention; I only thought,\r\nsir, you might be willing to consider how best to assist a nephew, who\r\nhas certainly not been wanting either in industry or economy, and who\r\nbears your name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I will think it over,\' said Mr. Egremont, rising to take leave.\r\n\r\nThe carriage had been bidden to await them at the door for their daily\r\ndrive, and as Mr. Egremont leant back with the furs disposed over him\r\nhe observed: \'That\'s a man who knows how to take care of himself.  I\r\nwonder where he gets his coffee, I\'ve not drunk any like it since I was\r\nat Nice.\'  And Nuttie, though well knowing that Mr. Dutton\'s love of\r\nperfection was not self-indulgence, was content to accept this as high\r\napprobation, and a good augury for Mark and Annaple.  Indeed, with Mr.\r\nDutton settled near, and with the prospect of a daily walk from church\r\nwith him, she felt such a complete content and trust as she had not\r\nknown since she had been uprooted from Micklethwayte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA BRAVE HEART.\r\n\r\n  \'One furnace many times the good and bad may hold,\r\n  Yet what consumes the chaff will only cleanse the gold.\'\r\n                                     Archbishop TRENCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever was there a truer verse than that which tells us that in seeking\r\nduty we find pleasure by the way, and in seeking pleasure we meet pain.\r\nIt might be varied to apply to our anticipations of enjoyment or the\r\nreverse.  Ursula had embraced her lot as a necessity, and found it\r\nenlivened by a good many sunshiny hours; and when she looked upon Mr.\r\nDutton\'s neighbourhood as a continual source of delight and\r\nsatisfaction, she found that it gave rise to a continual course of\r\nsmall disappointments.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he did not walk home from church with her every\r\nmorning.  She looked for him in vain, even when she knew he was in\r\ntown.  He only appeared there on Sundays, and at intervals when he had\r\nsome especial reason for speaking to her.  At first she thought he must\r\nhave grown lazy or out of health to have thus dropped his old\r\nMicklethwayte habits, but after a time she discovered by accident that\r\nhe frequented another church, open at a still earlier hour and a little\r\nfarther off, and she was forced to come to the conclusion that he acted\r\nout of his characteristic precise scrupulosity, which would not\r\nconsider it as correct for her to walk home every day with him. She\r\nchafed, and derided \'the dear old man\' a little in her own mind, then\r\nended with a sigh.  Was there any one who cared so much about what was\r\nproper for her?  And, after all, was he really older than Mr. Clarence\r\nFane, whom everybody in her father\'s set called Clarence, or even\r\nClare, and treated as the boy of the party, so that she had taken it as\r\nquite natural that he should be paired off with her.  It was quite a\r\ndiscovery!\r\n\r\nThere was another and more serious disappointment.  Mr. Egremont had\r\nnot seemed disinclined to consider the giving the agency to Mark, and\r\nNuttie had begun to think with great satisfaction of May Condamine\'s\r\ndelight in welcoming him, and of the good influence that would be\r\nbrought to bear on the dependents, when suddenly there came a coolness.\r\nShe could trace the moment, and was sure that it was, when Gregorio\r\nbecame aware of what was intended.  He had reason to dread Mark as an\r\nenemy, and was likely to wish to keep him at a distance; and it had\r\nbeen Ursula\'s great hope that an absolute promise might have been given\r\nbefore he heard of the plan; but Mr. Egremont was always slow to make\r\nup his mind, except when driven by a sudden impulse, and had never\r\nactually said that the post should be offered to his nephew.  Nuttie\r\nonly detected the turn of the tide by the want of cordiality, the hums\r\nand haws, and by and by the resumption of the unkind ironical tone when\r\nMark and Annaple were mentioned; and at last, when she had been reading\r\nto him a letter from Mrs. William Egremont full of anxiety for the\r\nyoung people, and yet of trust in his kindness to them, he exclaimed,\r\n\'You\'ve not been writing to her about this absurd proposal?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not mentioned any proposal at all.  What do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, this ridiculous idea about the agency.  As if I was going to put\r\nmy affairs into the hands of a man who has made such a mull of his own.\'\r\n\r\n\'But that was not Mark\'s fault, papa.  He was junior, you know, and had\r\nno power over that Goodenough.\'\r\n\r\n\'He ought, then!  Never sail with an unlucky captain.  No, no, Mark\'s\r\nhonourable lady would not let him take the agency when he might have\r\nhad it, and I am not going to let them live upon me now that they have\r\nnothing of their own.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, papa, but you almost promised!\'\r\n\r\n\'Almost!\' he repeated with his ironical tone; \'that\'s a word capable of\r\na good deal of stretching.  This is what you and that umbrella fellow\r\nhave made out of my not giving him a direct refusal on the spot.  He\r\nmay meddle with Mark\'s affairs if he chooses, but not with mine.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie had learnt a certain amount of wisdom, and knew that to argue a\r\npoint only made her father more determined, so she merely answered,\r\n\'Very well;\' adding in a meek voice, \'Their furniture, poor things!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh ay.  Their umbrella friend is making a collection for them.  Yes, I\r\nbelieve I said I would contribute.\'\r\n\r\nHot blood surged up within Nuttie at the contemptuous tone, and she bit\r\nher lip to keep down the answer, for she knew Mr. Dutton intended to\r\ncall the next afternoon for her father\'s ultimatum before going down to\r\nMicklethwayte, where the crisis was fast approaching, and she had so\r\nmuch faith in his powers that she dreaded to forestall him by an\r\nimprudent word.  Alas, Gregorio must have been on his guard, for,\r\nthough Nuttie was sure she heard her friend\'s ring at the usual time,\r\nno entrance followed.  She went up to put on her habit to ride with her\r\nfather, and when she came down Mr. Egremont held out a card with the\r\nname \'Philip Dutton,\' and the pencilled request below to be allowed to\r\nsee Mr. Egremont later in the day.\r\n\r\n\'He has been denied!\' exclaimed she in consternation.\r\n\r\n\'Hein!  Before we go out, sit down and write a note for me.\'  And he\r\ndictated--\r\n\r\n     \'Dear Sir--I will not trouble you to call again this\r\n      afternoon, as I have decided on reflection that there\r\n      is no employment on my estate suited to my nephew,\r\n      Mark Egremont.\r\n\r\n     \'As I understand that you are raising a family\r\n      subscription for rescuing his furniture from the\r\n      creditors, I enclose a cheque for \xa350 for the purpose.\r\n\r\n                                           --I remain--\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Yours--what--papa?--\' asked Ursula, with a trembling voice, full of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\'Yours, etc., of course.  Quite intimate enough for an\r\nex-umbrella-monger. Here, give it to me, and I\'ll sign it while you\r\nfill up the cheque for me.\'\r\n\r\nThat such should be the first letter that Nuttie ever addressed to Mr.\r\nDutton, since the round-hand one in \'which Miss Ursula wished Mr. Duton\r\nto have the onner of a tee with me on my birthday, and I am your\r\naffected little Nuttie\'!\r\n\r\nShe hoped to explain and lament the next morning, after church.  He\r\nwould surely come to talk it over with her; but he only returned a\r\ncivil note with his receipt, and she did not see him again before his\r\ndeparture.  She was greatly vexed; she had wanted so much to tell him\r\nhow it was, and then came an inward consciousness that she would\r\nprobably have told him a great deal too much.\r\n\r\nWas it that tiresome prudence of his again that would think for her and\r\nprevent impulsive and indignant disclosures?  It made her bring down\r\nher foot sharply on the pavement with vexation as she suspected that he\r\nthought her so foolish, and then again her heart warmed with the\r\nperception of self-denying care for her.  She trusted to that same\r\nprudence for no delusive hopes having been given to Mark and his wife.\r\n\r\nShe did so justly.  Mr. Dutton had thought the matter far too uncertain\r\nto be set before them.  The Canoness\'s vague hopes had been the fruit\r\nof a hint imprudently dropped by Nuttie herself in a letter to Blanche.\r\nShe had said more to Miss Nugent, but Mary was a nonconductor.  Mr.\r\nDutton\'s heart sank as he looked at the houses, and he had some\r\nthoughts of going to her first for intelligence, but Annaple had spied\r\nhim, and ran out to the gate to welcome him.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Mr. Dutton, I\'m so glad!  Mark will be delighted.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is he at home?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh no, at the office, wading through seas of papers with Mr.\r\nGreenleaf, but he will come home to eat in a quarter of an hour.  So\r\ncome in;\' then, as her boy\'s merry voice and a gruffer one were heard,\r\n\'That\'s the bailiff.  He is Willie\'s devoted slave.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hoped to have been in time to have saved you that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m convinced that among the much maligned races are bailiffs. I\r\nwonder what I could get by an article on prejudice against classes! I\r\nwas thinking how much beer I should have to lay in for this one, and\r\nbehold he is a teetotaller, and besides that amateur nurse-maid,\r\nparlour-maid, kitchen-maid, etc. etc.--\'\r\n\r\n\'What bailiff could withstand Mrs. Egremont?  Perhaps you have tamed\r\nhim?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not I.  The cook did that.  Indeed I believe there\'s a nice little\r\nidyll going on in the kitchen, and besides he wore the blue ribbon, and\r\nwas already a devoted follower of young Mr. Godfrey!\'\r\n\r\n\'However, if the valuation is ready, I hope you may be relieved from\r\nhim, if you won\'t be too much concerned at the parting!\'\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Egremont told us that our people are very good to us,\' said\r\nAnnaple, \'and don\'t mean to send us out with nothing but a pack at our\r\nbacks.  It is very kind in them and in you, Mr. Dutton, to take the\r\ntrouble of it!  No, I\'ll not worry you with thanks.  The great point\r\nis, hope for something for Mark to do.  That will keep up his spirits\r\nbest!  Poor Mr. Greenleaf is so melancholy that it is all I can do to\r\nkeep him up to the mark.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have been making inquiries, and I have three possible openings, but\r\nI hardly like to lay them before you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, we are not particular about gentility!  It is work we want, and if\r\nit was anything where I could help that would be all the better! I\'m\r\nsure I only wonder there are so many as three.  I think it is\r\nsomebody\'s doing.  Ah! there\'s Mark,\' and she flew out to meet him.\r\n\'Mark!\' she said, on the little path, \'here\'s the good genius, with\r\nthree chances in his pocket.  Keep him to luncheon.  I\'ve got plenty.\r\nPoor old man, how hot you look!  Go and cool in the drawing-room, while\r\nI wash my son\'s face.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she disappeared into the back regions, while Mark, the smile she\r\nhad called up vanishing from his face, came into the drawing-room, and\r\nheld out a cordial, thankful hand to his friend, whose chief\r\nintelligence was soon communicated.  \'Yes,\' said Mark, when he heard\r\nthe amount entrusted by the family to Mr. Dutton, \'that will save all\r\nmy wife\'s poor little household gods.  Not that I should call them so,\r\nfor I am sure she does not worship them.  I don\'t know what would\r\nbecome of me if she were like poor Mrs. Greenleaf, who went into\r\nhysterics when the bailiff arrived, and has kept her room ever since. I\r\nsometimes feel as if nothing could hurt us while Annaple remains what\r\nshe is.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton did not wonder that he said so, when she came in leading her\r\nlittle son, with his sunny hair newly brushed and shining, and carrying\r\na little bouquet for the guest of one La Marque rosebud and three\r\nlilies of the valley.\r\n\r\n\'Take it to Mr. Dutton, Billy-boy; I think he knows how the flowers\r\ncame into the garden.  You shall have daddy\'s button-hole to take to\r\nhim next.  There, Mark, it is a pansy of most smiling countenance, such\r\nas should beam on you through your accounts.  I declare, there\'s that\r\nparagon of a Mr. Jones helping Bessy to bring in dinner!  Isn\'t it very\r\nkind to provide a man-servant for us?\'\r\n\r\nIt might be rattle, and it might be inconsequent, but it was much\r\npleasanter than hysterics.  Billy-boy was small enough to require a\r\ngood deal of attention at dinner, especially as he was more disposed to\r\nopen big blue eyes at the stranger, than to make use of his spoon, and\r\nAnnaple seemed chiefly engrossed with him, though a quick keen word at\r\nthe right moment showed that she was aware of all that was going on, as\r\nMark and Mr. Dutton discussed the present situation and future measures.\r\n\r\nIt was quite true that a man concerned in a failure was in great danger\r\nof being left out of the race for employment, and Mr. Dutton did not\r\nthink it needful to mention the force of the arguments he was using to\r\nback his recommendation of Mark Egremont.  The possibilities he had\r\nheard of were a clerkship at a shipping agent\'s, another at a warehouse\r\nin their own line, and a desk at an insurance office.  This sounded\r\nbest, but had the smallest salary to begin with, and locality had to be\r\ntaken into account.  Mr. Dutton\'s plan was, that as soon as Mark was no\r\nlonger necessary for what Annaple was pleased to call the fall of the\r\nsere and withered leaf, the pair should come to stay with him, so that\r\nMark could see his possible employers, and Annaple consider of the\r\nsituations.  They accepted this gratefully, Mark only proposing that\r\nshe should go either to his stepmother or her own relations to avoid\r\nthe final crisis.\r\n\r\n\'As if I would!\' she exclaimed.  \'What sort of a little recreant goose\r\ndo you take me for?\'\r\n\r\n\'I take you for a gallant little woman, ready to stand in the breach,\'\r\nsaid Mark.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, don\'t flatter yourself!  There is a thing I have not got courage\r\nto face--without necessity, and that\'s Janet\'s triumphant pity.  Mr.\r\nDutton lives rather too near your uncle, but he is a man, and he can\'t\r\nbe so bad.\'\r\n\r\nThis of course did not pass till Mr. Dutton had gone in to greet the\r\nladies next door, to promise to tell them of their child at length when\r\nthe business hours of the day should be over.\r\n\r\nShall it be told?  There was something in his tone--perfectly\r\nindefinable, with which he spoke of \'Miss Egremont,\' that was like the\r\nold wistfully reverential voice in which he used to mention \'Mrs.\r\nEgremont.\'  It smote Mary Nugent\'s quiet heart with a pang.  Was it\r\nthat the alteration from the old kindly fatherliness of regard to\r\n\'little Nuttie\' revealed that any dim undefined hope of Mary\'s own must\r\nbe extinguished for ever; or was it that she grieved that he should\r\nagain be wasting his heart upon the impracticable?\r\n\r\nA little of both, perhaps, but Mary was as ready as ever to sympathise,\r\nand to rejoice in hearing that the impetuous child had grown into the\r\nforbearing dutiful woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nA FRESH START.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Did you say that Mark and his wife were come to Springfield House?\'\r\n\r\n\'They come the day after to-morrow,\' answered Ursula.  \'Mark could not\r\nfinish up the business sooner.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I suppose we must have them to dinner for once.  He has made a\r\nfool of himself, but I won\'t have the Canoness complaining that I take\r\nno notice of him; and it is easier done while he is there than when he\r\nhas got into some hole in the City--that is if he ever gets anything to\r\ndo.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Dutton has several situations in view for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'In view.  That\'s a large order.  Or does it mean living on Dutton and\r\ndoing something nominal?  I should think Dutton too old and sharp a\r\nhand for that, though he is quartering them on himself.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe there is nothing Mr. Dutton would like better, if he thought\r\nit right for them, but I am quite sure Mark and Annaple would not\r\nconsent.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha, ha!\' and Mr. Egremont laughed.  \'Their nose is not brought to the\r\ngrindstone yet!  Say Saturday, then, Ursula.\'\r\n\r\n\'Am I to ask Mr. Dutton?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course; I\'m not going to have a tete-a-tete with Master Mark.\'\r\n\r\nSo Ursula had the satisfaction of writing a more agreeable note to Mr.\r\nDutton than her last, and her invitation was accepted, but to her\r\nvexation Mr. Egremont further guarded himself from anything\r\nconfidential by verbally asking Mr. Clarence Fane on that very day, and\r\nas that gentleman was a baronet\'s son, she knew she should fall to his\r\nlot at dinner, and though she was glad when this was the case at their\r\nordinary parties, it was a misfortune on the present occasion.  She had\r\nnot seen Annaple since her marriage, except at the family gathering on\r\nthe Canon\'s death, when she was very much absorbed by the requirements\r\nof the stricken household; and Nuttie expected to see her in the same\r\nsubdued condition.  All Mr. Dutton had said or Mary Nugent had written\r\nabout her courage and cheerfulness had given the impression of\r\n\'patience smiling at grief,\' and in a very compassionate mood she\r\nstarted for a forenoon call at Springfield House; but, early as it was,\r\nnobody was at home, unless it might be the little boy, whose voice she\r\nthought she heard while waiting at the gate.\r\n\r\nShe was out driving with her father afterwards in the long summer\r\nevening, and only found Mark\'s card on returning just in time to dress.\r\nIt was a bright glaring day, and she was sitting by the window, rather\r\ninattentively listening to Mr. Fane\'s criticism of a new performance at\r\none of the theatres, when she heard the bell, and there entered the\r\nslight, bright creature who might still have been taken for a mere\r\ngirl.  The refined though pronounced features, the transparent\r\ncomplexion, crispy yellow hair and merry eyes, were as sunbeam-like as\r\nat the Rectory garden-party almost five years ago, and the black dress\r\nonly marked the contrast, and made the slenderness of the figure more\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nMark looked older, and wrung his cousin\'s hand with a pressure of\r\ngratitude and feeling, but Annaple\'s was a light little gay kiss, and\r\nthere was an entire unconsciousness about her of the role of poor\r\nrelation.  She made an easy little acknowledgment of the introduction\r\nof Mr. Fane, and, as Mr. Egremont appeared the next moment, exchanged\r\ngreetings with him in a lively ordinary fashion.\r\n\r\nThis was just what he liked.  He only wanted to forget what was\r\nunpleasant, and, giggling Scotch girl as she was, he was relieved to\r\nfind that she could not only show well-bred interest in the surface\r\nmatters of the time, but put in bright flashes of eagerness and\r\noriginality, well seconded by Mr. Dutton.  Mr. Fane was always a\r\nprofessor of small talk, and Nuttie had learnt to use the current\r\nchange of society, so that though Mark was somewhat silent, the dinner\r\nwas exceedingly pleasant and lively; and, as Mr. Fane remarked\r\nafterwards, he had been asked to enliven a doleful feast to ruined\r\nkindred, he could only say he wished prosperity always made people so\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\n\'This is all high spirit and self-respect,\' thought Nuttie.  \'Annaple\r\nis talking as I am, from the teeth outwards.  I shall have it out with\r\nher when we go upstairs!  At any rate my father is pleased with her!\'\r\n\r\nNuttie made the signal to move as soon as she could, and as they went\r\nupstairs, put her arm round the slim waist and gave a sympathetic\r\npressure, but the voice that addressed her had still the cheery ring\r\nthat she fancied had been only assumed.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sorry I missed you, but we set out early and made a day of it; and\r\noh! we\'ve been into such funny places as I never dreamt of!  You didn\'t\r\nsee my boy?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  I thought I heard him.  I must see him to-morrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I must see yours.  May it not be a pleasure to-night?  I\'ve no\r\ndoubt you go and gloat over him at night.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I do generally run up after dinner; but after your day, I can\'t\r\nthink of dragging you up all these stairs.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that\'s nothing!  Only you see it is jollier to have my Billy-boy\r\nin the next room.\'\r\n\r\nThey were mounting all the time, and were received in the day nursery\r\nby the old Rectory nurse, much increased in dignity, but inclined to be\r\npathetic as she inquired after \'Mr. Mark,\' while Annaple, like a little\r\ninsensible being, answered with provoking complacency as to his perfect\r\nhealth, and begged Mrs. Poole to bring Master Alwyn to play in the\r\ngarden at Springfield with her Willie.  In fact there was a general\r\ninvitation already to Alwyn to play there, but his attendants so much\r\npreferred the society of their congeners in the parks that they did not\r\navail themselves of it nearly as often as Ursula wished.\r\n\r\nLittle Alwyn asleep was, of course, a beautiful sight, with a precious\r\nold headless rabbit pressed tight to his cheek; Annaple\'s face grew\r\ntender as she looked at the motherless creature; and she admired him to\r\nany extent except saying that he excelled her own. Being more than a\r\nyear the elder, there could be no rivalry as to accomplishments; but as\r\nsoon as they were out of the nursery hush, Annaple laughed her way down\r\nagain with tales of Billy-boy\'s wonder at his first experiences of\r\ntravelling.  They sat down among the plants in the balcony, as far from\r\nthe lamps as possible, and talked themselves into intimacy over\r\nMicklethwayte.  There are two Eden homes in people\'s lives, one that of\r\nlater childhood, the other the first of wedded happiness, and St.\r\nAmbrose Road had the same halo to both of these; for both had been\r\nuprooted from it against their will; the chief difference being that\r\nUrsula could cast longing, lingering looks behind, while Annaple held\r\nherself resolutely steeled against sentiment, and would only turn it\r\noff by something absurd.  Nothing was absolutely settled yet; Mark had\r\nbeen presenting himself at offices, and she had been seeing rooms and\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\n\'The insurance office sounds the best, and would be the least shock to\r\nour belongings,\' said Annaple; \'but it seems to lead to nothing. He\r\nwould not get on unless we had capital to invest, and even if we had\r\nany, you wouldn\'t catch us doing that again!\'\r\n\r\n\'Does Mr. Dutton advise that?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, he only thought we should like it better; but we are quite past\r\ncaring for people\'s feelings in the matter.  They couldn\'t pity us\r\nworse than they do.  I incline to Stubbs and Co.  One of them was once\r\nin the Greenleaf office, and has a regard for anything from thence;\r\nbesides Mark would have something to do besides desk work. He would\r\nhave to judge of samples, and see to the taking in and storing of\r\ngoods.  He does know something about that, and I\'m sure it would agree\r\nwith him better than an unmitigated high stool, with his nose to a\r\ndesk.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like it better.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s right!  Now I have got some one to say so.  Besides, rising is\r\npossible, if one gets very useful.  I mean to be Mrs. Alderman, if not\r\nmy Lady Mayoress, before we have done.  Then they have a great big\r\nalmost deserted set of rooms over the warehouse, where we might live\r\nand look after the place.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! but should you like that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Dutton wants us to live out in some of the suburban places, where\r\nit seems there is a perfect population of clerks\' families in\r\nsemi-detached houses.  He says we should save Mark\'s railway fare,\r\nrent, and all in doctors\' bills.  But people, children and all, do live\r\nand thrive in the City; and I think Mark\'s health will be better looked\r\nafter if I am there to give him his midday bite and sup, and brush him\r\nup, than if he is left to cater for himself; and as to exercise for the\r\nBilly-boy, \'tis not so far to the Thames Embankment. The only things\r\nthat stagger me are the blacks!  I don\'t know whether life is long\r\nenough to be after the blacks all day long, but perhaps I shall get\r\nused to them!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I think that would be worse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps it would; and at any rate, if the blacks do beat me, we could\r\nmove.  Think, no rent, nor rates, nor taxes--that is an inducement to\r\nswallow--no--to contend with, any number of blackamoors, isn\'t it? even\r\nif they settle on the tip of Billy-boy\'s nose.\'\r\n\r\n\'I could come to see you better there than out in a suburb,\' said\r\nNuttie.  \'But what do these rooms look out upon?\'\r\n\r\n\'On one side into their own court, on the other into Wulstan Street--a\r\nquiet place on the whole--all walls and warehouses; and there\'s an\r\nexcellent parish church, Mr. Underwood\'s; so I think we might do worse.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie was very sorry that the gentlemen came up, and Mr. Fane wandered\r\nout and began asking whether they were going to the rose show.  Somehow\r\non that evening she became conscious that Annaple looked at her and Mr.\r\nFane rather curiously; and when they met again the next day, and having\r\ngrown intimate over the introduction of the two little boys, were\r\ndriving out together, there were questions about whether she saw much\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I don\'t know!  He is the nicest, on the whole, of papa\'s friends;\r\nhe can talk of something besides\'--Nuttie paused over her\r\n\'besides,\'--\'horseyness, and all that sort of thing--he is not so like\r\nan old satyr as some of them are; and so he is a resource.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see.  And you meet him elsewhere, don\'t you, in general society?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t go out much now that Lady Kirkaldy is not in town; but he\r\nalways seems to turn up everywhere that one goes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ursula, I\'m very glad of that tone of yours.  I was afraid--\'\r\n\r\n\'Afraid of what?\' cried Nuttie in a defiant tone.\r\n\r\n\'That you liked him, and he is not really nice, Nuttie.  Mark knows all\r\nabout him; and so did I when I lived with the Delmars.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie laughed rather bitterly.  \'Thank you, Annaple.  As if I could\r\ncare for that man--or he for me, for that matter!  I know but too\r\nwell,\' she added gravely, \'that nobody nice is ever intimate at home.\'\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon.  I would not have worried you about it, only I\r\nthink you must take care, Nuttie, for Blanche mentioned it to us last\r\nwinter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Blanche is an arrant gossip!  If she saw a grandfather and great\r\ngrandmother gossiping she would say they were going to be married.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, as Mark says, one always swallows Blanche with a qualification.\'\r\n\r\n\'You may be quite sure, Annaple, that nothing like that will ever be\r\ntrue about me!  Why, what would ever become of my poor little Wyn if I\r\nwas so horrid as to want to go and marry?\'\r\n\r\nShe said it with an ineffable tone of contempt, just like the original\r\nNuttie, who seemed to be recalled by association with Annaple.\r\n\r\nThat sojourn of Mark and his wife at Springfield House was a bright\r\nspot in that summer.  If it had been only that Annaple\'s presence gave\r\nthe free entree to such an island of old Micklethwayte, it would have\r\nbeen a great pleasure to her; but there was besides the happiness of\r\nconfidence and unrestraint in their society, a restful enjoyment only\r\nto be appreciated by living the guarded life of constraint that was\r\nhers.  She was so seldom thrown among people whom she could admire and\r\nlook up to.  Annaple told her husband of Nuttie\'s vehement repudiation\r\nof any intention of marriage.  \'I am sure she meant it,\' she observed,\r\n\'it was only a little too strong. I wonder if that poor youth who came\r\nto her first ball, and helped to pick us out of the hole in Bluepost\r\nBridge, had anything to do with it.\'\r\n\r\nAnnaple had an opportunity of judging.  Mr. Dutton would not have\r\nbrought about a meeting which might be painful and unsettling to both;\r\nbut one afternoon, when Nuttie was \'off duty\' with her father, and had\r\ncome in to share Annaple\'s five o\'clock tea, Gerard Godfrey, looking\r\nthe curate from head to foot, made his appearance, having come up from\r\nthe far east, about some call on Mr. Dutton\'s purse.\r\n\r\nThe two shook hands with pleased surprise, and a little heightening of\r\ncolour, but that was all.  Nuttie had been out to luncheon, and was\r\ndressed \'like a mere fashionable young lady\' in his eyes; and when,\r\nafter the classes and clubs and schools of his district had been\r\ndiscussed, he asked, \'And I suppose you are taking part in everything\r\nhere?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, that I can\'t!\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed!  I know Porlock, the second curate here very well, and he\r\ntells me that his vicar has a wonderful faculty of finding appropriate\r\nwork for every one.  Of course you know him?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I don\'t;\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Miss Egremont has her appropriate work,\' said Mr. Dutton, and the\r\ndeacon felt himself pushed into his old position at Micklethwayte. He\r\nknew the clergy of the district very well, and how persistently either\r\nMr. Egremont, or perhaps Gregorio, prevented their gaining admittance\r\nat his house; and he guessed, but did not know, that Nuttie could not\r\nhave got into personal intercourse with them without flat disobedience.\r\n\r\nAnnaple threw herself into the breach, and talked of St. Wulstan\'s; and\r\nthe encounter ended, leaving the sense of having drifted entirely away\r\nfrom one another, and being perfectly heart whole, though on the one\r\nhand Ursula\'s feeling was of respect and honour; and Gerard\'s had a\r\nconsiderable element of pity and disapprobation.\r\n\r\n\'No!\' said Annaple when they were gone, \'he will not cry like the\r\nkloarek in the Breton ballad who wetted three great missals through\r\nwith his tears at his first mass.  He is very good, I am sure, but he\r\nis a bit of a prig!\'\r\n\r\n\'It is very hard to youth to be good without priggishness,\' said Mr.\r\nDutton.  \'Self-assertion is necessary, and it may easily be carried too\r\nfar.\'\r\n\r\n\'Buttresses are useful, but they are not beauties,\' rejoined Annaple.\r\n\r\nThe warehouse arrangement was finally adopted, and after the three\r\nweeks necessary for the cleaning and fitting of their floor, and the\r\nbringing in of their furniture, Mark and Annaple began what she termed\r\n\'Life among the Blacks.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie had great designs of constantly seeing Annaple, sending her\r\nsupplies from the gardens and preserves at Bridgefield, taking her out\r\nfor drives, and cultivating a friendship between Alwyn and Willie, who\r\nhad taken to each other very kindly on the whole.  They could not\r\nexactly understand each other\'s language, and had great fights from\r\ntime to time over toys, for though there was a year between them they\r\nwere nearly equal in strength; but they cared for each other\'s company\r\nmore than for anything else, were always asking to go to one another,\r\nand roared when the time of parting came; at least Alwyn did so\r\nunreservedly, for Nuttie had begun to perceive with compunction that\r\nBilly-boy was much the most under control, and could try to be good at\r\nhis mother\'s word, without other bribe than her kiss and smile.  Ah!\r\nbut he had a mother!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nNUTTIE\'S PROSPECTS.\r\n\r\n  \'Three hundred pounds and possibilities.\'--Merry Wives of Windsor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain Nuttie\'s plans were doomed to be frustrated.  It did not prove to\r\nbe half so easy to befriend Mr. and Mrs. Mark Egremont as she expected,\r\nat the distance of half London apart, and with no special turn for\r\nbeing patronised on their side.\r\n\r\nHer father took a fancy for almost daily drives with her in the park,\r\nbecause then he could have Alwyn with him; and the little fellow\'s\r\nchatter had become his chief amusement.  Or if she had the carriage to\r\nherself, there was sure to be something needful to be done which made\r\nit impossible to go into the city to take up and set down Mrs. Mark\r\nEgremont; and to leave her to make her way home would be no kindness.\r\nSo Nuttie only accomplished a visit once before going out of town, and\r\nthat was by her own exertions--by underground railway and cab.  Then\r\nshe found all going prosperously; the blacks not half so obnoxious as\r\nhad been expected (of course not, thought Nuttie, in the middle of the\r\nsummer); the look-out over the yard very amusing to Billy-boy; and the\r\nlarge old-fashioned pannelled rooms, so cool and airy that Annaple was\r\nquite delighted with them, and contemned the idea of needing a holiday.\r\nShe had made them very pretty and pleasant with her Micklethwayte\r\nfurniture, whose only fault was being on too small a scale for these\r\nlarger spaces, but that had been remedied by piecing, and making what\r\nhad been used for two serve for one.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was on the same floor, close at hand, which was well, for\r\nAnnaple did a good deal there, having only one young maid for the\r\nrougher work.  She had taken lessons in the School of Cookery, and\r\npractised a good deal even at Micklethwayte, and she was proud of her\r\nskill and economy.  Mark came in for his mid-day refreshment, and\r\nlooked greatly brightened, as if the worst had come and was by no means\r\nso bad as he expected.  All the time he had been at Mr. Dutton\'s he had\r\nbeen depressed and anxious, but now, with his boy on his knee, he was\r\nmerrier than Nuttie had ever known him.  As to exercise, there were\r\ndelightful evening walks, sometimes early marketings in the long summer\r\nmornings before business began--and altogether it seemed, as Nuttie\r\ntold her father afterwards, as if she had had a glimpse into a little\r\nCity Arcadia.\r\n\r\n\'Hein!\' said he, \'how long will it last?\'\r\n\r\nAnd Nuttie was carried away to Cowes, where he had been persuaded to\r\nrecur to his old favourite sport of yachting.  She would have rather\r\nliked this if Clarence Fane had not been there too, and continually\r\nhaunting them.  She had been distrustful of him ever since Annaple\'s\r\nwarning, and it became a continual worry to the motherless girl to\r\ndecide whether his civil attentions really meant anything, or whether\r\nshe were only foolish and ridiculous in not accepting them as freely\r\nand simply as before.\r\n\r\nOf one thing she became sure, namely, that Gregorio was doing whatever\r\nin him lay to bring them together.\r\n\r\nIn this seaside temporary abode, great part of the London establishment\r\nwas left behind, and Gregorio condescended to act the part of butler,\r\nwith only a single man-servant under him, and thus he had much more\r\nopportunity of regulating the admission of visitors than at home; and\r\nhe certainly often turned Mr. Fane in upon her, when she had intended\r\nthat gentleman to be excluded, and contrived to turn a deaf or\r\nuncomprehending ear when she desired that there should be no admission\r\nof visitors unless her father was absolutely ready for them; and also\r\nthere were times when he must have suggested an invitation to dinner,\r\nor a joining in a sail.  No doubt Gregorio would have been delighted to\r\nsee her married, and to be thus free from any counter influence over\r\nhis master; but as she said to herself, \'Catch me!  Even if I cared a\r\nrush for the man, I could not do it.  I don\'t do my poor father much\r\ngood, but as to leaving poor little Alwyn in his clutches--I must be\r\nperfectly demented with love even to think of it.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a desire on the valet\'s part to coax and court little Alwyn\r\nof which she felt somewhat jealous.  The boy was naturally the pet of\r\nevery one in the household, but he was much less out of Gregorio\'s\r\nreach in the present confined quarters, and she could not bear to see\r\nhim lifted up in the valet\'s arms, allowed to play with his watch, held\r\nto look at distant sails on board the yacht, or even fed with sweet\r\nbiscuits or chocolate creams.\r\n\r\nThe Rectory nursery had gone on a strict regimen and nurse was as angry\r\nas Nuttie herself; but there was no preventing it, for his father was\r\nnot above cupboard love, and never resisted the entreaties that were\r\nalways excited by the sight of dainties, only laughing when Nuttie\r\nremonstrated, or even saying, \'Never mind sister, Wynnie, she\'s got\r\nMrs. Teachem\'s cap on,\' and making the child laugh by pretending to\r\nsmuggle in papers of sweets by stealth, apart from the severe eyes of\r\nsister or nurse.\r\n\r\nThat cut Nuttie to the heart.  To speak of the evils for which\r\nself-indulgence was a preparation would only make her father sneer at\r\nher for a second Hannah More.  It was a language he did not understand;\r\nand as to the physical unwholesomeness, he simply did not choose to\r\nbelieve it.  She almost wished Alwyn would for once be sick enough to\r\nfrighten him, but that never happened, nor would he accept nurse\'s\r\nstatement of the boy being out of order.\r\n\r\nPoor little Alwyn, he was less and less of an unmixed joy to her as he\r\nwas growing out of the bounds of babyhood, and her notions of\r\ndiscipline were thwarted by her father\'s unbounded indulgence.  To her\r\nthe child was a living soul, to be trained for a responsible position\r\nhere and for the eternal world beyond; to her father he was a\r\ndelightful plaything, never to be vexed, whose very tempers were\r\namusing, especially when they teased the serious elder sister.\r\n\r\n\'Oh father! do you ever think what it will come to?\' Nuttie could not\r\nhelp saying one day when Mr. Egremont had prevented her from carrying\r\nhim off in disgrace to the nursery for tying the rolls up in dinner\r\nnapkins to enact Punch and Judy, in spite of his own endeavours to\r\nprevent the consequent desolation of the preparations.\r\n\r\nMr. Egremont shrugged his shoulders, and only observed, \'An excuse for\r\na little home tyranny, eh?  No, no, Wyn; we don\'t want tame little\r\nmuffs here.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie was obliged to run out of the room and--it must be\r\nconfessed--dance and stamp out her agony of indignation and misery that\r\nher father should be bent on ruining his child, for she could not\r\nunderstand that all this was simply the instinctive self-indulgence of\r\na drugged brain and dulled conscience.\r\n\r\nShe did, however, get a little support and help during a brief stay in\r\nthe shooting season at Bridgefield.  The Canoness was visiting the\r\nCondamines at the Rectory, and very soon understood all the state of\r\nthings, more perhaps from her former nurse than from Ursula.  She was\r\nwitness to one of those trying scenes, when Nuttie had been forbidding\r\nthe misuse of a beautiful elaborate book of nursery rhymes, where Alwyn\r\nthought proper to \'kill\' with repeated stabs the old woman of the shoe,\r\nwhen preparing to beat her progeny.\r\n\r\nJust as she was getting the dagger paper-knife out of his little hand,\r\nand was diverting the pout on his swelling lip, his father became aware\r\nof the contest, and immediately the half conquered boy appealed to him.\r\n\'Sister naughty.  Won\'t let Wynnie kill cross ugly old woman, beating\r\npoor little children.\'\r\n\r\n\'A fellow feeling! eh, sister?  Kill her away, boy, tear her out! Yes,\r\ngive her to sister, and tell her that\'s the way to serve sour females!\r\nI declare, Ursula, she has got something of your expression.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh Wynnie, Wynnie!\' said Nuttie, as he trotted up to her, \'is sister\r\ncross and ugly?\' and she opened her arms to him.\r\n\r\n\'Sister, Wyn\'s own sister,\' said the child affectionately, letting\r\nhimself be kissed as he saw her grieved.  \'She shan\'t be ugly old\r\nwoman--ugly old woman go in fire.\'\r\n\r\nSo perilously near the flame did he run to burn the old woman that Mr.\r\nEgremont shouted to her that in spite of all that humbug, she was\r\nperfectly careless of the child, although if she had withheld him she\r\nwould probably have been blamed for thwarting him.\r\n\r\n\'Are you quite fair towards Ursula?\' the aunt ventured to say when the\r\ngirl had gone to dress for walking down with her to the Rectory. \'It is\r\nhard on her, and not good for the boy to upset her authority.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eh?  Why, the girl is just a governess manquee, imbued with the spirit\r\nof all those old women who bred her up.  A nice life the poor child\r\nwould have of it, but for me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sure she is devotedly attached to him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hein!  So she thinks; but trust human nature for loving to wreak\r\ndiscipline on the child who has cut her out.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is scarcely just, Alwyn.  She was greatly relieved to be cut out.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Egremont laughed at this, and his sister-in-law indignantly added\r\nwith all the authority of a successful parent, \'Anyway, nothing is so\r\nbad for a child as collision between the authorities in a family.\r\nUrsula is doing her best to act as a mother to that child, and it will\r\nbe very injurious to him to interfere with her influences.\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s a good girl enough--gives very little trouble,\' he allowed, \'but\r\nI\'m not going to have the boy sat upon.\'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the words, Nuttie returned, and as soon as she was out of\r\nthe house and out of hearing she exclaimed, \'Oh, Aunt Jane, you see how\r\nit is!  How am I to prevent my boy from being utterly ruined?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have been speaking to your father,\' said Mrs. Egremont, \'but he does\r\nnot seem to understand.  Men don\'t.  A child\'s faults and fancies seem\r\nsuch trifles to them that they can\'t see the harm of indulging them,\r\nand, besides, they expect to be amused.\'\r\n\r\n\'And is that poor dear little fellow to grow up spoilt?\' said Nuttie,\r\nher eyes hot with unshed tears.\r\n\r\n\'I hope not, Ursula.  I have great confidence in your influence, for I\r\nsee you are a sensible girl.\'  This was astonishing praise from the\r\nCanoness.  \'But you will throw away your chances if you keep up a\r\ncontinual opposition to what your father allows.  It will be much less\r\nhurtful if Alwyn does get too much indulgence, and does a little\r\nunnecessary mischief, than for him to learn to think you the enemy of\r\nhis pleasures, always wanting to check and punish him.  Oh yes,\' as\r\nNuttie was going to answer, \'I know it is for his real good, but how is\r\nthat baby to understand that?  Indeed, my dear, I know how it is; I\r\nhave gone through the same sort of thing with Basil.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it could never have been so bad!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, of course not; but I have had to allow what I did not like for the\r\nchild rather than let him see the shadow of difference of opinion\r\nbetween us, and I don\'t think it has done him any harm.  The great\r\npoint is that you should keep that poor little fellow\'s affection and\r\nrespect, and make him unwilling to vex you.\'\r\n\r\n\'That he is, dear little man.  He is sorry when he sees sister grieved.\r\nHe is always distressed if anything is hurt or pained.  He is really\r\ntender-hearted.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but boys are boys.  That feeling will fail you if you work it too\r\nhard, and especially if you show vexation at his pleasures.  Keep that\r\nfor real evils, like falsehood or cruelty.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not for disobedience?\'\r\n\r\n\'The evil of disobedience depends much more upon the authority of an\r\norder than on the child itself.  If he disobeys you under his father\'s\r\nlicence, you cannot make much of it.  You have him a good deal to\r\nyourself?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then make use of that time to strengthen his principles and sense of\r\nright and wrong, as well as to secure his affections.  My dear, I never\r\nsaw a girl in a more difficult position than yours, but I see you are\r\ndoing your utmost; only I am afraid the love of sedatives is the same.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh aunt, I did think he had given it up!\'\r\n\r\n\'You are inexperienced, my dear.  I see it in his eyes.  Well, I\'m\r\nafraid there is no stopping that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother--\' and Nuttie\'s voice was choked.\r\n\r\n\'She did her best, but you have not the same opportunities.  It can\'t\r\nbe helped with a man of that age.  Mark might have done something, but\r\nhe is out of the question now, poor fellow!\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, Aunt Jane, I think Mark and Annaple are some of the happiest\r\npeople I ever saw.  I only wish my poor Alwyn were as forward as their\r\nBilly, but I\'m not even allowed to teach him his letters, because once\r\nhe cried over them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish they had anything to fall back upon,\' said Mrs. Egremont\r\nanxiously.  \'They are so unwilling to let any one know of their\r\ndifficulties that I feel as if I never knew in what straits they may\r\nbe.  You will be sure to let me know, Ursula, if there is anything that\r\nI can do for them.\'\r\n\r\nThat conversation was a great comfort and help to Nuttie, who was\r\npleased to find herself treated as a real friend by her aunt, and\r\nperceived the wisdom of her advice.  But the watching over the Mark\r\nEgremonts was a very difficult matter to accomplish, for when she went\r\nback to London she was warned that Billy had the whooping cough,\r\nrendering them unapproachable all the winter, so that she could only\r\nhear of them through Mr. Dutton, whom she continued to see occasionally\r\nwhenever there was anything to communicate.  Mr. Egremont rather liked\r\nhim, and on meeting him in the street, would ask him casually in to\r\ndinner, or to make up a rubber, or play piquet, for he excelled in\r\nthese arts, and still more in chess, and an evening with Mr. Dutton was\r\nquite a red-letter time with Nuttie. It gave her an indefinable sense\r\nof safety and protection; but it was not always to be had, for her\r\nfriend had many engagements, being one of the active lay church\r\nworkers, and devoting two regular evenings in each week to Gerard\r\nGodfrey\'s eastern district, where he kept all the accounts, had a model\r\ncourt and evening class, besides hospitably resting tired clergymen and\r\ntheir wives in his pleasant quiet house.\r\n\r\nIn the spring Mr. Egremont was laid up with the worst rheumatic attack\r\nhe had yet had, in consequence of yielding to the imperious will of his\r\nson, who had insisted on standing in a bleak corner to see the Life\r\nGuards pass by.  On this occasion Nuttie did not prove herself the\r\nheaven-born nurse that the true heroine ought to be, but was extremely\r\nfrightened, and altogether dependent on Gregorio, who knew all about\r\nthe symptoms, and when to send for the doctor and a garde-malade.\r\nGregorio always talked French to Nuttie when he felt himself in the\r\nascendant, as he certainly was at present; but he became much less\r\ngracious when he heard that Mrs. William Egremont might be expected,\r\ndeclaring that madame would only excite his master, and that her\r\npresence was quite unnecessary.  Her coming had been volunteered, but\r\nit was a great boon to Ursula, who was thus helped out in many\r\nperplexities, although Mrs. Egremont was a great deal at her\r\nstep-son\'s, and neither lady was of much avail in the sick-room, during\r\nthe stress of the illness.  It was never actually dangerous, but there\r\nwas great suffering and much excitement, and for four or five days the\r\ndistress and anxiety were considerable.  After this passed off Ursula\r\nwas surprised to find her company preferred to that of her aunt.  She\r\nwas a better souffre-douleur, was less of a restraint, and was besides\r\nhis regular reader and amanuensis, so that as the force of the attack\r\nabated, he kept her a good deal in his room during the latter part of\r\nthe day, imparting scraps of intelligence, skimming the papers for him,\r\nand reading his letters.\r\n\r\nThere was a lease to be signed, and, as soon as might be, Mr. Bulfinch,\r\nthe Redcastle solicitor, brought it up, and had to be entertained at\r\nluncheon.  While he was waiting in the drawing-room for Mr. Egremont to\r\nbe made ready for him, he looked with deep interest on the little heir,\r\nwhom Ursula presently led off to the other end of the room to the hoard\r\nof downstair toys; and an elaborate camp was under construction, when\r\nby the fireside, the Canoness inquired in a low confidential tone, \'May\r\nI ask whether you came about a will?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Mrs. Egremont.  I wish I were.  It is only about the lease of\r\nSpinneycotes farm.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then there is none?\'\r\n\r\n\'None that I am aware of.  None has ever been drawn up by us. Indeed, I\r\nwas wishing that some influence could be brought to bear which might\r\nshow the expedience of making some arrangement.  Any melancholy event\r\nis, I trust, far distant, but contingencies should be provided for.\'\r\n\r\n\'Exactly so.  He is recovering now, but these attacks always leave\r\neffects on the heart, and at his age, with his habits, no one knows\r\nwhat may happen.  Of course it would not make much difference to the\r\nboy.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, the Court of Chancery would appoint the most suitable natural\r\nguardians.\'\r\n\r\n\'But,\' said Mrs. Egremont, \'I am afraid that the personal property when\r\ndivided would not be much of a provision for her.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are right.  The investments are unfortunately and\r\ndisproportionately small.\'\r\n\r\n\'She ought either to have them all, or there should be a charge on the\r\nestate,\' said the Canoness decisively.  \'If possible, he must be made\r\nto move.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t!\' cried Nuttie, jumping up from the floor.  \'He mustn\'t be\r\nupset on any account.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, I had no notion that you heard us!\' exclaimed her aunt.  \'I\r\nthought Alwyn was making too much noise with his soldiers.\'\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon,\' said Nuttie, \'perhaps I should have spoken sooner,\r\nbut indeed he must not be worried and disturbed,\' she added, somewhat\r\nfiercely.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be afraid, my dear,\' said her aunt.  \'Mr. Bulfinch knows that\r\nyour father is in no condition to have such matters brought before him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly,\' said the old lawyer politely;\' and we will trust that Miss\r\nEgremont\'s prospects may soon come forward on a more auspicious\r\noccasion.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie could have beaten him, but she was obliged to content herself\r\nwith such a sweeping charge of her Zulus among Alwyn\'s Englishmen, that\r\ntheir general shrieked out in indignation against such a variation of\r\nthe accustomed programme of all their games.\r\n\r\nNuttie thought she had defended her patient sufficiently, but she found\r\nshe had been mistaken, for when her aunt had left them, some days\r\nlater, her father began, \'We are well quit of her.  Those troublesome\r\ndictatorial women always get worse when they are left widows--taking\r\nupon them to say what their dear husbands would have said, forsooth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Jane was very kind to me,\' said Ursula, not in the least knowing\r\nwhat he was thinking of.\r\n\r\n\'To you.  Ay, I should think so, taking upon her to lecture me about\r\nsecuring a provision for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!  I hoped--\'\r\n\r\n\'What?\' he broke in.  \'You knew of it!  You set her on, I suppose.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! no, no, father.  She and Mr. Bulfinch began about it, not meaning\r\nme to hear--about a will, I mean--and I told them I wasn\'t going to\r\nhave you worried, and I thought I had stopped it altogether.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stop a woman bent on her duty?  Hein!  But you are a good girl, and\r\nshall come to no loss when we have to make your marriage settlement.\'\r\n\r\n\'You won\'t have to do that, father!\'\r\n\r\n\'Hein!  What do you keep that poor fellow Clarence Fane dangling in\r\nattendance on you for?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t!  I\'m sure I don\'t want him.  I would do anything to keep him\r\nat a distance!\'\r\n\r\n\'How now!  I thought your Grace condescended to him more than to any\r\none else.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t dislike him unless he has _that_ in his head; but as to\r\nmarrying him!  Oh--h--h,\' such a note of horror that elicited a little\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\'So hot against him, are we?  Who is it then?  Not the umbrella fellow?\'\r\n\r\n\'Father! how can you?\' she cried, with a burning flush of indignation.\r\nHe--why--he!  He has always been a sort of uncle, ever since I was a\r\nlittle girl.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, adopted uncles are very devout when young ladies rush out to\r\nmorning prayers at unearthly hours--\'\r\n\r\n\'Father!\' with her voice trembling, \'I assure you he doesn\'t--I mean he\r\nalways goes to St. Michael\'s, unless he has anything particular to say\r\nto me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, I understand,\' and Mr. Egremont indulged in a hearty laugh,\r\nwhich almost drove poor Nuttie beside herself.\r\n\r\n\'Indeed--indeed,\' she stammered, in her confusion and suppressed wrath;\r\n\'it is nothing of that sort.  He is a regular old bachelor--he always\r\nwas.\'\r\n\r\n\'At what age do men become old bachelors?  For he seems to me about the\r\nage of poor Clarry, whom you seem to view as a bugbear.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you would not think of such things, father; I have not the\r\nslightest intention of leaving you and dear little Wynnie!  Nothing\r\nshould tempt me!\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing?  Hein!  Then you may as well be on your guard, Miss Egremont,\r\nor we shall have pleadings that you have encouraged them--church and\r\nworld--or both, maybe.  You pious folk take your little diversions and\r\nflirtations just like your poor sisters whom you shake your heads at,\r\nnever guessing how Gregorio and I have looked out at you and your\r\nadopted uncle parading the street.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish Gregorio would mind his own business, and not put such things\r\nin your head!\' burst out Nuttie.\r\n\r\nAt which Mr. Egremont laughed longer and louder than ever.\r\n\r\nPoor Nuttie!  It was terrible discomfiture, not only for the moment,\r\nbut a notion had been planted in her mind that seemed cruel, almost\r\nprofane, and yet which would not be dismissed, and made her heart leap\r\nwith strange bounds at the wild thought, \'Could it be true?\' then sink\r\nagain with shame at her own presumptuous folly in entertaining such a\r\nthought for a moment.\r\n\r\nYet whenever she actually encountered Mr. Dutton her habitual comfort\r\nand reliance on him revived, and dispelled all the embarrassment which\r\nat other times she expected to feel in his presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nSPES NON FRACTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer had quite set in before Mr. Egremont was able to go out for a\r\ndrive, and then he was ordered to Buxton.\r\n\r\nNuttie only once saw her cousins before leaving town, for their little\r\nboy fulfilled the nursery superstition by whooping till May; and all\r\nintercourse was prohibited, till he had ceased for a whole week to\r\nutter a suspicious sound.  Mr. Dutton had insisted on the family\r\nspending a fortnight at Springfield House for change of air, and it was\r\nthere that Nuttie was permitted to see them, though the children were\r\nstill forbidden to meet.\r\n\r\nAnnaple looked very thin, but rattled as merrily as ever.  \'No one\r\ncould guess,\' she said, \'what a delight it was not to know what one was\r\nto have for dinner?\'\r\n\r\n\'To do more than know, I am afraid,\' said Ursula.\r\n\r\n\'Well, next to the delight of knowing nothing at all about it--and even\r\nthat is only good for a holiday--is the delight of seeing a pudding\r\ncome out smooth and comfortable and unbroken from its basin. "Something\r\nattempted, something done," you know.  It is quite as good a work of\r\nart as a water-coloured drawing.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only not quite so permanent.\'\r\n\r\n\'No; it is only one\'s first pudding that one wants to embalm in a glass\r\ncase for being so good as not to leave its better part behind in the\r\nbasin, or to collapse as soon as it is in the dish.\'\r\n\r\n\'Which my puddings always did in the happy days of old, but then I was\r\nalways hunted ignominiously out of the kitchen and told I wasted good\r\nfood,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and waste is fearful when Mark and Billy have to eat it all the\r\nsame, like the poor cows with spoilt hay.  I wonder whether your old\r\nexperiences recall the joy of finding trustworthy eggs within your\r\nprice.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, I was not housekeeper.  I only remember being in disgrace for\r\ngrumbling when there was no pudding, because the hens would not lay.\'\r\n\r\n\'Though I heard a woman declaring the other day that there ought to be\r\na machine for them.  Oh, the scenes that I encounter when I am\r\nmarketing!  If I only could describe them for Punch!  I walked home\r\nonce with our porter\'s wife, carrying two most brilliant sticks of\r\nrhubarb, all carmine stalk and gamboge leaf, and expressing a very\r\nnatural opinion that the rhubarb tree must be very showy to look at,\r\nand curious to know in what kind of fruit the medicine grew.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Annaple! do you go yourself in that way?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mark used to go with me, but, poor old fellow, he has ruinous ideas\r\nabout prices and quantities, and besides, now he is so hard worked-up\r\nand down all day--he wants a little more of his bed in the morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what do you want?\'\r\n\r\n\'I never was a sleepy creature, and I get back in time to dress the\r\nboy.  I generally find him at high-jinks on his father\'s bed.  It uses\r\nup a little superfluous energy before the dressing.\'\r\n\r\n\'But surely you have a servant now?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve come to the conclusion that a workman\'s wife charing is a better\r\ninstitution.  No. 1, a pet of Miss Nugent\'s, was a nice creature, but\r\nthe London air did for her at once.  No. 2, also from Micklethwayte,\r\ninstantly set up a young man, highly respectable, and ready to marry on\r\nthe spot, as they did, though their united ages don\'t amount to\r\nthirty-nine.  No. 3 was a Cockney, and couldn\'t stay because the\r\nlook-out was so dull; and No. 4 gossiped with her kind when I thought\r\nher safe in the Temple Gardens with Billy, whereby he caught the\r\nwhooping-cough, and as she also took the liberty of wearing my fur\r\ncloak, and was not particular as to accuracy, we parted on short\r\nnotice; and I got this woman to come in every day to scrub, help make\r\nthe bed, etc.  It is much less trouble, and the only fault I have to\r\nfind with her is an absolute incapability of discerning blacks.  I\r\nbelieve she thinks I have a monomania against them.\'\r\n\r\nStill Annaple insisted that she did not work half so hard as her\r\nnieces, Muriel and Janet, in their London season, and that her economy\r\nwas not nearly so trying and difficult as that which Lady Delmar had\r\nbeen practising for years in order to afford them a summer there; nor\r\nwas her anxiety to make both ends meet by any means equal to her\r\nsister\'s in keeping up appearances, and avoiding detrimentals. The two\r\nsisters met occasionally, but Lady Delmar was so compassionate and\r\npatronising that Annaple\'s spirit recoiled in off-hand levity and\r\nrattle, and neither regretted the occupation that prevented them from\r\nseeing much of one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA year passed by, chiefly spent by Mr. Egremont in the pursuit of\r\ncomparative health, at Buxton, Bagneres, and Biarritz, during which his\r\ndaughter could do little but attend to him and to little Alwyn. The boy\r\nhad been enough left to her and nurse during his father\'s acute illness\r\nto have become more amenable.  He was an affectionate child,\r\ninheriting, with his mother\'s face, her sweetness and docility of\r\nnature, and he was old enough to be a good deal impressed with the fact\r\nthat he had made poor papa so ill by teasing him to stand in the cold.\r\nMr. Egremont was not at rest without a sight of the child every day, if\r\nonly for a moment, and the helplessness and suffering had awed the\r\nlittle fellow a good deal.  It was touching to see him pause when\r\ngalloping about the house when he went past the sick-room, and hush his\r\nmerry voice of his own accord.\r\n\r\nAnd in the journeys, when his father\'s invalided state would have made\r\na fractious or wilful child a serious inconvenience, his good temper\r\nand contentment were invaluable.  He would sit for hours on his\r\nsister\'s lap, listening to whispered oft-told tales, or playing at\r\nimpromptu quiet games; he could go to sleep anywhere, and the wonderful\r\ndiscoveries he made at each new place were the amusement of all his\r\nauditors.  Sister was always his playfellow and companion whenever she\r\ncould be spared from her father, and she had an ever-increasing\r\ninfluence over him which she did her best to raise into principle.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she never had a happier moment than when she heard how he had\r\nput his hands behind him and steadily refused when Gregorio had offered\r\nto regale him at a stall of bonbons forming only a thin crust to\r\nliqueurs, which unfortunately he had already been taught to like.\r\n\r\n\'But I told him sister said I mustn\'t have them,\' said Alwyn.  \'And\r\nthen he made a face and said something in French about you.  I know\r\n\'twas you, for he said "soeur."  What was it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, Wynnie dear. We had much better never know.  You were\r\nsister\'s own dear steadfast boy, and you shall kiss mother\'s picture.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie had a beautiful coloured photograph of her mother, finished like\r\na miniature, which had been taken at Nice, in the time of Alice\r\nEgremont\'s most complete and matured beauty.  She had taught Alwyn to\r\nkiss and greet it every evening before his prayers, and such a kiss was\r\nhis reward when he had shown any special act of goodness, for which, as\r\nshe told him, \'mother would have been pleased with her little son.\'\r\n\r\nSuch another boon was his one Sunday evening at Biarritz, when she\r\nfound that while she was shut up at dinner with her father he had\r\nvoluntarily gone to church with nurse instead of playing on the beach\r\nwith some other English children.  \'It was all very long and tiresome,\'\r\nhe said, when asked if he liked it.\r\n\r\n\'Then why did you go, old man?  There was no need to drag you there,\'\r\nsaid his father.\r\n\r\n\'She didn\'t drag me,\' said the boy; \'I walked.\'\r\n\r\n\'You need not have walked then, Master Dignity.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor nursie couldn\'t go without me,\' said Alwyn, \'and sister says\r\nthere\'s a blessing on those that go.\'\r\n\r\n\'A blessing? eh! and what idea does that little head entertain of a\r\nblessing?\' said Mr. Egremont.\r\n\r\nAlwyn lifted his soft brown eyes reverently and said, \'It is something\r\ngood,\' speaking, as he always did, in a baby lisp inimitable here.\r\n\r\n\'Well?\'\r\n\r\n\'And it comes from God.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, what is it?  Can you see it?\'\r\n\r\n\'No\'--he looked in perplexity towards Nuttie, who was in agony all the\r\ntime, lest there should be a scoff that might remain in the child\'s\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind sister.  Can you feel it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes;\' and the little face lighted with such a reality that the\r\nincipient mockery turned into wonder on the next question.\r\n\r\n\'And how does it feel?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, so nice!  It makes Wynnie glad here,\' and he spread his hands over\r\nhis breast; and gave a little caper like a kid for very gladness.\r\n\r\n\'There!\' said Mr. Egremont, leaning back fairly conquered.  \'Any one\r\nmight envy Wynnie!  Goodnight, my boy, blessing and all.  I wonder if\r\none felt like that when one was a little shaver,\' he pursued, as Alwyn\r\nwent off to his bed.\r\n\r\n\'I think I did sometimes,\' said Nuttie, \'but I never was half as good\r\nas Wynnie!\'\r\n\r\n\'What?\' exclaimed her father.  \'You! bred up among the saints.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! but I hadn\'t the same nature.  I never was like--_her_.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well--\'tis very pretty now, and I don\'t know how we could stand a\r\nyoung Turk, but you mustn\'t make a girl of him.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no fear of that,\' said Nuttie.  \'He is full of spirit.  That\r\nold bathing woman calls him "un vrai petit diable d\'Anglais," he is so\r\nventurous.\'\r\n\r\nWhich delighted Mr. Egremont as much as the concession that the boy\'s\r\nfaith was \'pretty\' delighted Ursula.  Indeed, he went a little further,\r\nfor when she came back from her few minutes at Alwyn\'s bedside he\r\nproceeded to tell her of the absolute neglect in which his mother, a\r\nbelle of the Almacks days, had left her nursery.  It was the first time\r\nhe had ever hinted at a shadow of perception that anything in his own\r\nlife had been amiss, and Ursula could not but feel a dreamy, hopeful\r\nwonder whether her sweet little Alwyn could be the destined means of\r\ndoing that in which her mother had failed.  It was at least enough to\r\nquicken those prayers which had been more dutiful than trustful.\r\n\r\nAnd then her hope sank again when she realised that her father\'s days\r\nwere spent between the lull of opiate, followed by a certain serenity,\r\nthen in a period of irritability, each being more or less prolonged,\r\naccording to health, weather, or entertainment, and closed again by the\r\nsedatives in various forms.  It relieved her indeed, but she felt it a\r\nwickedness to be glad of the calm, and she was aware that the habit was\r\nmaking inroads on her father\'s powers.  Between that and his defect of\r\neyesight, he was often much confused, especially about money matters,\r\nand was more and more dependent.\r\n\r\nWould that it had been only upon her, but she was constantly certain\r\nthat Gregorio was taking advantage of his master\'s helplessness, and\r\nkeeping it up by all means in his power.  Yet what could be done? For\r\nthe valet was absolutely necessary to his comfort, and yet she\r\nsometimes thought her father half in dread of him, and afraid to\r\nexpostulate about personal neglects, which became more frequent.\r\nThings, that would have enraged him from others, were only grumbled and\r\nfretted over, when Gregorio caused him real inconvenience by absence or\r\nforgetfulness, and made very insufficient apology.  It seemed like a\r\nbondage; Nuttie thought of her mother\'s efforts, and blamed herself in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nIt was during this journey that she heard of good Miss Headworth\'s\r\ndeath.  The old lady\'s mind had long failed, and the actual present\r\nloss to Nuttie was not great; but it seemed to close a long account of\r\ngratitude such as she had not thoroughly felt or understood before; and\r\nthe link with Micklethwayte was severed.\r\n\r\nFor Mark and Annaple prevailed on Mrs. Egremont to install Miss Nugent\r\nas governess to Rosalind and Adela.  In that capacity Nuttie hoped to\r\nsee a good deal of her; but of course was again disappointed, for her\r\nfather would not hear of returning to Bridgefield.  It was draughty,\r\nand dull, and desolate, and nothing suited him but London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nBLACKS IN THE ASCENDANT.\r\n\r\n  \'Man\'s work ends with set of sun,\r\n  Woman\'s work is never done.\'--Proverb.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was far on in May when Ursula found herself again in the\r\nsitting-room over the warehouse.  Somehow it had not the dainty\r\nwell-cared-for air of erst.  The pretty table ornaments were out of\r\nsight; the glass over the clock was dim, the hands had stopped; some of\r\nAnnaple\'s foes, the blacks, had effected a lodgment on the Parian\r\nfigures; the chintzes showed wear and wash, almost grime; the carpet\'s\r\npattern was worn; a basket full of socks was on the sofa; and on the\r\ntable a dress, once belonging to Annaple\'s trousseau, was laid out,\r\nconverted into its component parts.  The wails of a baby could be heard\r\nin the distance, and the first person to appear was Master William,\r\nsturdy and happy in spite of wofully darned knees to his stockings.\r\n\r\n\'Mother\'s coming, if baby will stop crying,\' he said, \'and lie in her\r\ncradle.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your little sister!  What\'s her name?\'\r\n\r\n\'Jane Christian,\' said the boy, with a much more distinct enunciation\r\nthan Alwyn, though a year older, had yet acquired.  \'She does cry so!\r\nShe won\'t let mother make my new knickies out of her blue gown!\'\r\n\r\nThoughts of the suits that Alwyn was discarding came across Nuttie.\r\nCould they be offered without offence?  She asked, however, \'Do you\r\nremember Alwyn--my Wynnie?\'\r\n\r\n\'Wynnie gave me my horse,\' cried the boy, unstabling a steed which had\r\nseen hard service since the presentation.  \'Where\'s Wynnie?\'\r\n\r\n\'He is at home.  You must come and see him,\' said Nuttie, who had not\r\nbeen allowed to bring him till secure of a clean bill of health. \'But\r\nsee, just outside the door, there\'s something for Billy.\'\r\n\r\nShe had made her servant bring up the parcels to the passage outside,\r\nand Billy was soon hugging a magnificent box of soldiers, wherewith he\r\npranced off to show them to his mother, leaving the doors open, so that\r\nUrsula could more decidedly hear the baby\'s voice, not a healthy\r\nchild\'s lusty cry, but a poor little feeble wail, interspersed with\r\nattempts at consolation.  \'Come, won\'t she go to Emily?  Oh, Billy-boy,\r\nhow splendid!  I hope you thanked Cousin Ursula.  Baby Jenny, now can\'t\r\nyou let any one speak but yourself?  Oh! shall I never teach you that\r\n"Balow, my babe," is not "bellow, my babe."  That\'s better!  Now can\'t\r\nyou let Emily have you, while I go to Cousin Nuttie?\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me come!  Mayn\'t I?\' exclaimed Ursula, invading the room that\r\nserved as kitchen, where Annaple was trying to hush off the child and\r\nmake her over to a little twelve years old maid, who stood in waiting,\r\nhelping Willie meantime to unpack his soldiers, with smothered\r\nexclamations of delight.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Nuttie, how good of you!  Please to excuse the accompaniment.\r\nThere never was such a young lady for self-assertion to make up for\r\nthere being so little of her.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Annaple, very thin and tired looking, held up the child, fearfully\r\nsmall and pinched for four months old, to be kissed by Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Does she always go on like this?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Cept when she is asleep,\' said Willie.\r\n\r\n\'Poor wee lassie,\' said Annaple; \'there\'s great excuse for her, for the\r\nfood has not yet been invented that suits her ladyship.\'\r\n\r\n\'You must come and consult nurse.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how are you all?  I\'m glad you are at hand, Nuttie!  Is Mr.\r\nEgremont better?\'\r\n\r\n\'As well as ever he is--lame and altogether an invalid,--but he has not\r\nhad such bad attacks of pain lately.\'\r\n\r\n\'And his eyes?\'\r\n\r\n\'About the same.  He can write, and tell one card from another, but he\r\ncan\'t read--or rather it hurts him to do so, and he can\'t bear a strong\r\nlight.  But, Annaple, how are you?  That child is wearing you to a\r\nshadow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! I\'m quite well--perfectly.  There, I think she is gone off at\r\nlast.  You had better walk her about a little, Emily; she will break\r\nout again if we try to put her in the cradle.\'\r\n\r\nAnd having handed over the child with only a very low murmur, Annaple\r\nleft her combined kitchen and nursery.  She flew at the flowers Nuttie\r\nhad brought like a thirsty person, crying, as she buried her face in\r\nthem, \'Now for beauty!  Now Mark will be refreshed!  Ah! here\'s a\r\npretty pickle for a reception room.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t put it away!  I could help you; I do so like that kind of\r\nwork.  It is so like old times.\'\r\n\r\n\'It must be put away, thank you, for Mark will be coming in.  And the\r\nsaying about the public washing of garments is specially true of one\'s\r\nown husband.  Ways and means are worrying to the masculine mind.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought it was too early for Mark?\'\r\n\r\n\'He has an appointment to keep at Charing Cross or thereabouts, so I\r\nmade him promise to come in in time to "put a bit in his head," as our\r\nIrish charwoman says.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I can take him.  I have the carriage, and I must be at home by\r\nhalf-past twelve.  I wish you would come too, Annaple.  There\'s plenty\r\nof room.  You could show the baby to nurse, and the boys could have a\r\ngood game.  I would send you back in the evening.  Mark could come on\r\nafter his business is done.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Nuttie, I can\'t to-day--for a whole heap of domestic\r\nreasons; but, if you can get Mark to come, do, it would be so good for\r\nhim.\'\r\n\r\n\'How is Mark?\'\r\n\r\n\'He is well, quite well,\' said Annaple; \'and so good and patient. But\r\nyou see, it does take it out of a man when that doleful little noise\r\nwon\'t stop all night!  We are both acquiring a form of somnambulism,\r\nbut when there\'s real out-of-door business to be done, it is not like\r\nproper sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or when there\'s woman\'s indoor business, I am afraid,\' said Nuttie,\r\nmuch concerned at the extreme thinness of Annaple\'s face and hands, and\r\nthe weary look of her large eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, one makes that up at odd times!\' she answered brightly.  \'One\r\nthing is, this work suits Mark, he feels that he can do it, and he gets\r\non well with the men.  They asked him to join in their club, and he was\r\nso much pleased.  He gets up subjects for them, and I am so glad he has\r\nsuch a pleasure and interest to keep him from missing the society he\r\nwas used to.\'\r\n\r\n\'It must be very good for them too.  Mr. Dutton said he really thought\r\nMark had kept them from going in for a strike.\'\r\n\r\n\'Besides the glory of the thing,\' said Annaple drawing herself up, \'Mr.\r\nDobbs thought so too, and raised us ten pounds; which made us able to\r\nimport that little Bridgefield lassie to hold baby--when--when Miss\r\nJenny will let her.  He has some law copying to do besides, but I don\'t\r\nlike that; it burns the candle at both ends, and he does get bad\r\nheadaches sometimes, and goes on all the same.\'\r\n\r\n\'You must both come and see my Wyn.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! I had never asked after him.  I suppose he is as pretty as ever,\'\r\nsaid Annaple, who secretly thought his beauty too girlish compared with\r\nher sturdy Billy.\r\n\r\n\'Prettier, I think, as he gets more expression.  We can\'t persuade\r\nourselves to cut his hair, and it looks so lovely on his sailor suit.\r\nAnd he is so good.  I could not have believed a child could be so quiet\r\nand considerate on a journey.  You should have seen him standing by my\r\nfather\'s knee in the railway carriage, and amusing him with all that\r\nwas to be seen, and stopping at the least hint that he was chattering\r\ntoo much.\'\r\n\r\n\'Billy is wonderfully helpful.  Ah--\' and Annaple\'s eyes lighted up as\r\nthe step that had music in\'t came up the stair; and as Mark came in,\r\nNuttie thought him grown older, his hair thinner, his shoulders\r\nrounded, and his office coat shabby, but she saw something in his\r\ncountenance there had never been before.  Ever since she had known him\r\nhe had worn a certain air of depression, or perhaps more truly of\r\nfailure and perplexity, which kept before her conscious mind the\r\nDesdichado on Ivanhoe\'s shield, even when he was a gentleman at ease at\r\nthe luxurious Rectory; but there was now not only the settled air of a\r\nman who had found his vocation, but something of the self-respect and\r\neagerness of one who was doing it well, and feeling himself valued.\r\n\r\n\'Is baby--\' he began.  \'Oh, Nuttie!  Are you there?  Mr. Dutton told me\r\nyou were coming.  How is my uncle?\'  And the voice was much brisker\r\nthan in the days of lawn-tennis.\r\n\r\n\'Father, father, look!\' cried the boy.\r\n\r\n\'Why, Billy-boy, you are set up!  Zouaves and chasseurs!  I see where\r\nthey came from.\'\r\n\r\nDuring the mixture of greetings and inquiries, admiration of the\r\nflowers, and the exhibition of Billy\'s treasures, Annaple glided away,\r\nand presently placed before him a tray, daintily benapkinned and set\r\nforth with a little cup of soup.\r\n\r\n\'Baby is really asleep, and Emily as proud as a Hielandman,\' she said.\r\n\'Now eat this, without more ado, for that good Nuttie is going to set\r\nyou down at Charing Cross.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is the way we spoil our husbands, Nuttie,\' said Mark. \'Refections\r\nserved up at every turn.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only bones!  The immortal pot au feu,\' said Annaple.  \'And you are to\r\ngo on after you have interviewed your man of steel, and have tea with\r\nNuttie, and pay your respects to your uncle, like a dutiful nephew.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, that I can\'t, Nannie; I promised Dobbs to go and see a man for\r\nhim, and I must come back as soon as I can after that.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked--as to figure and air--much more like his old self when he\r\nhad changed his coat.  They fed him, almost against his will, with a\r\nfew of the forced strawberries Nuttie had brought.  Billy pressed on\r\nhim wonders from a Paris bonbon box, and Annaple fastened a rose and a\r\npink in his button-hole, and came down to the street door with her boy\r\nto see him off.\r\n\r\n\'What do you think of her?\' was Mark\'s first inquiry.\r\n\r\n\'Think!  As Mr. Dutton said long ago, never was braver lady!\'\r\n\r\n\'Never was there a truer word!  I meant as to her health?  As to\r\ncourage, spirits, and temper, there is no question; I never saw them\r\nfail; but are they not almost too much for the frame?\' he asked\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\nIt echoed Nuttie\'s fear, but she tried to frame a cheerful answer. \'She\r\nis very thin, but she seems well.\'\r\n\r\n\'She never complains, but I am sure her strength is not what it was.\r\nShe cannot walk out as she did at first.  Indeed, she gets no real rest\r\nday nor night, and there\'s no relieving her!\'\r\n\r\n\'She says you don\'t get much rest either.\'\r\n\r\n\'More than my share,\' said Mark.  \'The poor little thing never sleeps\r\nexcept in someone\'s arms, and if awake, is not content for a moment\r\nexcept in her mother\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'And that has been going on four months?\'\r\n\r\n\'Three.  Ever since we brought her back from Redcastle.  I have nearly\r\ndetermined to move into some suburb when I get a rise at Michaelmas,\r\nunless she improves.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nurse might suggest something.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or at any rate tell us what to think.  We showed her to a doctor, and\r\nall he could propose was some kind of food, which was no more\r\nsuccessful than the rest.  Did you look at her, Nuttie?  She is a\r\npretty little thing when she is quiet, but she dwindles away--at least\r\nso it seems to me, though Annaple will not see it, and--and if we are\r\nnot permitted to keep the little one, I dread what the effect may be on\r\nher.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie said something about bravery and goodness, thinking in her heart\r\nthat, if the blow fell, it would be better for all than the perpetual\r\nsuffering of the poor little sickly being.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! you don\'t know what her affections are,\' said Mark.  \'You did not\r\nsee her when she lost her mother, and there had been no strain on her\r\npowers then.  However, I\'ve no business to croak.  Many a child gets\r\nover troubles of this kind, and, as Annaple says, little Jenny will be\r\nall the more to us for what we go through with her.\'\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped, and Nuttie asked him if it would delay him too\r\nlong if she executed a commission about her father\'s glasses.  He had\r\nplenty of time, but she was delayed longer than she expected, and on\r\nher return was surprised to find that he had dropped asleep.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! that\'s what comes of a moment\'s quiet;\' he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\'Fine quiet in the roar of Ludgate Hill!\'\r\n\r\n\'To a Cockney \'tis as the mill to the miller!  I like the full stir and\r\ntide,\' he added, looking out upon it.  \'I never knew what life was\r\nbefore!\'\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought you never knew what hardness and hard work were.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just it,\' he answered, smiling.  \'The swing of it is\r\nexhilaration--very different from being a cumberer of the ground.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Mark, all the privations and anxiety!\'\r\n\r\n\'The privation! that\'s nothing.  Indeed I am afraid--yes, I am ashamed\r\nto say--it falls more on my dear wife than myself, but if we can only\r\nwear through a year or two we shall get a further rise, and my poor\r\nAnnaple may get out of this drudgery.  Please God, she and the little\r\none can stand it for a time, and I think she has a spring within her\r\nthat will;\' then, as he saw tears in his cousin\'s eyes, he added,\r\n\'Don\'t be unhappy about it, Nuttie; I have had it in my mind ever so\r\nlong to tell you that the finding you at Micklethwayte was the best\r\nthing that ever happened to me!\'\r\n\r\nYes, so far as character went, Ursula could believe that it had been\r\nso.  He was twice the man he would have been without the incentive to\r\nwork, and the constant exercise of patience and cheerfulness; but her\r\nheart was heavy with apprehension that the weight of the trial might be\r\ntoo heavy.  To her eyes the baby\'s life seemed extremely doubtful, and\r\nAnnaple looked so fragile that the increase of her burthens, any\r\nsaddening of the heart, might destroy her elasticity, and crush her\r\noutright; while even Mark seemed to her to be toiling so close within\r\nthe limits of his powers that a straw might break the camel\'s back!\r\n\r\nShe longed to talk to Mr. Dutton about them, but she found herself\r\ndoomed to a day that perhaps Annaple would have thought more trying\r\nthan her harrowed life.  She was a little later than she had intended,\r\nand her father had been waiting impatiently to have a note read to him,\r\nso he growled at her impatience to run after \'that Scotch girl.\'  And\r\nthe note happened to be of an irritating nature; moreover, the cutlets\r\nat luncheon were said to be akin to indiarubber, and there was the\r\nwrong flavour in the sauce.  Ursula let that cook do what she pleased\r\nwithout remonstrance.\r\n\r\nEven Alwyn did not afford as much satisfaction as usual, for the boy\r\nwas in high spirits and wanted to blow a little trumpet, which was more\r\nthan his father could stand.  He was very good when this was silenced,\r\nbut he then began to rush round the room daring his sister to catch the\r\nwild colt as he went by.  This had likewise to be stopped, with the\r\nmurmur that Ursula spoilt the child.\r\n\r\nShe tried to compose matters by turning out the old toys in the\r\nottoman, but Alwyn had outgrown most of them, and did not care for any\r\nexcept a certain wooden donkey, minus one ear and a leg, which went by\r\nthe name of Sambo, and had absorbed a good deal of his affection.  He\r\nhad with difficulty been consoled for Sambo being left behind, and now\r\nturned over everything with considerable clatter in search of him.\r\nAlas!  Sambo could nowhere be found in the room, and Alwyn dashed off\r\nto inquire of all the household after him.  His father meanwhile\r\ngrowled at the child\'s noise, and went on trying the glasses Nuttie had\r\nbrought, and pronouncing each pair in turn useless, vowing that it was\r\nno use to send her anywhere.\r\n\r\nUpon this, back came Alwyn, terribly distressed and indignant, for he\r\nhad extracted from the housemaid left in charge, who was as cross as\r\nshe was trustworthy, \'What! that old broken thing, Master Egremont? I\r\nthrew it on the fire!  I\'d never have thought a young gentleman of your\r\nage would have cared for such rubbish as that.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are a wicked cruel woman,\' returned Alwyn, with flashing eyes; \'I\r\nshall tell papa and sister of you.\'\r\n\r\nAnd in he flew, sobbing with grief and wrath for the dear Sambo,\r\nfeeling as if it had been a live donkey burnt to death, and hiding his\r\nface on his sister\'s breast for consolation.\r\n\r\n\'Come, come, Wyn,\' said his father, who did not brook interruption;\r\n\'here\'s half a sovereign to go and buy a new donkey.\'\r\n\r\n\'It won\'t be Sambo,\' said Alwyn ruefully.\r\n\r\n\'But you should thank papa,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, papa,\' he said, with quivering lip, \'but I don\'t want a new\r\none.  Oh Sambo, Sambo! burnt!\' and he climbed on Nuttie\'s lap, hid his\r\nface against her and cried, but her comfortings were broken off by,\r\n\'How can you encourage the child in being so foolish?  Have done, Wyn;\r\ndon\'t be such a baby!  Go out with nurse and buy what you like, but I\r\ncan\'t have crying here.\'\r\n\r\nHe tried to stop in sheer amazement, but the ground swell of sob could\r\nnot be controlled.  Nuttie was going to lead him away, and console him\r\nwith more imaginative sympathy than could be expected from the maids,\r\nbut her father sharply called her back.  He wanted her himself, and\r\nindeed there was no question which was the worse spoilt child.  He\r\nmight idolise Alwyn, but not so as to clash with his own comforts.  The\r\nglasses being unsuccessful, Nuttie proposed to drive back to Ludgate\r\nHill for him to choose for himself, but he would not hear of going into\r\nthe heat of the City, and growled at her for thinking of such a thing.\r\n\r\nThey took an aimless drive instead in the park, and Nuttie was nearly\r\nbaked while the carriage was stopped for her father to have a long talk\r\nover the prospects of the Derby day with one of his most unpleasant\r\nassociates, who stood leaning over the door on the shady side of the\r\ncarriage, no one recking how little protection she derived from her\r\nsmall fringed parasol.\r\n\r\nShe came home tired out, and thankful that her father went to rest in\r\nhis own room.  She climbed to the nursery, thinking to share Alwyn\'s\r\ntea and comfort him, but she found only nurse there.  Nurse had a bad\r\nfoot, and dreaded hot pavement, so she had sent Master Alwyn out with\r\nher subordinate, a country girl, to play in Mr. Dutton\'s garden till it\r\nshould be cool enough to go and make his purchase, and a message had\r\nsince arrived that he was going to drink tea there, and Mr. Dutton\r\nwould take him out.\r\n\r\nHis sister envied him the green shades, and had just done her best to\r\ncool the back drawing-room and rest herself with a book, when Mr. Fane\r\nwas announced.  He talked pleasantly enough, and lingered and lingered,\r\nno doubt intending to be asked to dinner, but she was equally\r\ndetermined to do no such thing.  She had heard enough of races for one\r\nday, she thought, and at last he took his leave, only just before she\r\ndressed for dinner.\r\n\r\n\'I thought Fane was here,\' said Mr. Egremont as he came in; no doubt\r\ntold by Gregorio.\r\n\r\n\'He has been, but he is gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'You didn\'t ask him to stay and dine?\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not know you wished it.\'\r\n\r\n\'You might have known that I should have liked to see him.  I suppose\r\nyou think your sweet self society enough for any man?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry--\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sick of hearing you are sorry!  I believe there\'s nothing you like\r\nso well as doing an ungracious thing to a friend of mine.\'\r\n\r\nNuttie had learnt to hold her tongue on such occasions.\r\n\r\nDinner was nearly over, and her father had been grumbling again at\r\nhaving no one to take a hand at cards with him, when the door opened a\r\nlittle way, and Alwyn\'s pretty glowing face looked in.  He was come to\r\nsay good-night rather later than usual, and he ran up to his sister\r\nwith a little bouquet of yellow banksia and forget-me-nots. \'Mithter\r\nButton\'--so Alwyn called him--\'sent you this.  He said you would like\r\nit, \'cause it came from one that grew at Mittletwait.  And oh, look,\r\nlook!\'\r\n\r\nHe was hugging a little ship, which he proudly exhibited, while his\r\nfather\'s brow had darkened at the message.  \'Did you buy that?\' asked\r\nhis sister.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Mr. Button went with me, and we sailed it.  We sailed it by the\r\nfountain in Mr. Button\'s garden, And we made a storm!\'\r\n\r\nHe danced about with glee, and Mr. Egremont observed, \'A dear purchase\r\nfor ten shillings.  Did it cost all that, Wyn?\'\r\n\r\n\'They gived me a big silver half-crown, and I gived that to a little\r\nboy what came to speak to Mr. Button, and had his toes through his\r\nboots, and he was so glad.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your money is not for beggars, Wyn.\'\r\n\r\n\'The little boy was not a beggar, papa.  He came with a newspaper to\r\nMr. Button, and he is so good to his poor sick mother,\' said Alwyn.\r\n\'See, see, sister!\' turning the prow of his small vessel towards her,\r\nand showing a word on it in pencil which he required her to spell out.\r\nIt was Ursula.\r\n\r\n\'Oh Wynnie!\' she said, duly flattered, \'did Mr. Dutton do that?\'\r\n\r\n\'He held my hand, and I did!\' cried Alwyn, triumphantly, \'and he will\r\npaint it on Saturday.  Then it will dry all Sunday, and not come off,\r\nso it will be the Ursula for ever and always.\'\r\n\r\nHere nurse claimed her charge; and when the goodnights were over, and a\r\nmurmur recommenced, Nuttie suggested that if Mr. Dutton was at home\r\nperhaps he would come in and make up the game, but she encountered the\r\nold humour.  \'I\'ll tell you what, Ursula, I\'ll not have that umbrella\r\nfellow encouraged about the house, and if that child is to be made the\r\nmedium of communication, I\'ll put a stop to it.\'\r\n\r\nThe words were spoken just as Gregorio had entered the room with a\r\nhandkerchief of his master\'s.  Nuttie, colouring deeply at the insult,\r\nmet his triumphant eyes, bit her lips, and deigned no word of reply.\r\n\r\nAn undefined but very slight odour, that told her of opium smoke,\r\npervaded the stairs that night.  It was the only refuge from\r\nfretfulness; but her heart ached for her father, herself, and most of\r\nall for her little brother.  And was she to be cut off from her only\r\ncounsellor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LOST HEIR.\r\n\r\n  \'Seemed to the boy some comrade gay\r\n  Led him forth to the woods to play.\'--SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough it was the Derby day, Mr. Egremont\'s racing days were over, and\r\nhe only took his daughter with him in quest of the spectacles he\r\nwanted.  When they came back, Nuttie mounted to the nursery, but no\r\nlittle brother met her on the stairs, and she found nurse in deep\r\ndispleasure with her subordinate.\r\n\r\n\'I sent him out with Ellen to play in the garden at Springfield, and\r\nswim his ship, where he couldn\'t come to no harm,\' said nurse; \'being\r\nthat my foot is that bad I can\'t walk the length of the street; and\r\nwhat does the girl do but lets that there Gregorio take the dear child\r\nand go--goodness knows where--without her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure, ma\'am,\' said the girl crying, \'I would never have done it,\r\nbut Mr. Gregory said as how \'twas his papa\'s wish.\'\r\n\r\n\'What was?\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'That he shouldn\'t never go and play at Mr. Dutton\'s again,\' said Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'I told her she was to take her orders off me, and no one else,\'\r\nreturned nurse, \'except, of course, you, Miss Egremont, as has the\r\nright.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite so; you should have told Mr. Gregorio so, Ellen.\'\r\n\r\n\'I did, ma\'am, but he said those was Mr. Egremont\'s orders; and he\r\nsaid,\' cried the girl, unable to withstand the pleasure of repeating\r\nsomething disagreeable, \'that Mr. Egremont wouldn\'t have no messengers\r\nbetween you and a low tradesman fellow, as made umbrellas, and wanted\r\nto insinuate himself in here.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s quite enough, Ellen; I don\'t want to hear any impertinences.\r\nPerhaps you did not understand his foreign accent.  Did he say where he\r\nwas going?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think he said he\'d take him to the Serpentine to sail his ship,\'\r\nsaid Ellen, disposed to carry on asseverations of the correctness of\r\nher report, but nurse ordered her off the scene, and proceeded, as a\r\nconfidential servant, \'The girl had no call to repeat it; but there\'s\r\nnot a doubt of it he did say something of the sort.  There\'s not one of\r\nus but knows he is dead against Mr. Dutton, because he tried to get\r\nmaster to get to sleep without that nasty opium smoke of his.\'\r\n\r\nThere was bitter feud between nurse and valet, and Nuttie could have\r\nexchanged with her many a lament, but she contented herself with\r\nsaying, \'I wish he would let Master Alwyn alone.  It is high time they\r\nshould come in.\'\r\n\r\n\'The child will be tired to death, and all dirt!  His nice new sailor\r\nsuit too!  Going grubbing about at the Serpentine with no one knows\r\nwho, as isn\'t fit for a young gentleman,\' moaned nurse.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was the worst fear she entertained, and it was with a\r\ncertain malicious satisfaction that she heard her master\'s bell for\r\nGregorio.\r\n\r\nNuttie descended to explain, and whereas the need was not very urgent,\r\nand she looked distressed and angered at the valet, her father received\r\nher complaint with, \'Well, the boy is getting too big to be tied for\r\never to a nursery-maid.  It will do him good to go about with a man.\'\r\n\r\nBut as dressing-time came on, and still neither Gregorio nor Alwyn\r\nappeared, Mr. Egremont became impatient, and declared that the valet\r\nhad no business to keep the child out so long; indeed, he would sooner\r\nhave taken alarm but for Nuttie\'s manifest agony of anxiety, starting\r\nand rushing to listen at every ring at the bell or sound of wheels near\r\nat hand.  At last, at eight o\'clock, there was a peal of the servants\'\r\nbell, and the footman who answered it turned round to the anxious\r\ncrowd: \'Mr. Gregory!  He just asked if the child was come home, and\r\nwent off like lightning.\'\r\n\r\n\'The villain!  He\'s lost him!\' shrieked nurse, with a wild scream. \'Run\r\nafter him, James!  Catch him up!\' suggested the butler at the same\r\nmoment.  \'Make him tell where he saw him last!\'\r\n\r\nJames was not a genius, but the hall boy, an alert young fellow, had\r\nalready dashed down the steps in pursuit, and came up with the valet so\r\nas to delay him till the other servants stood round, and Gregorio\r\nturned back with them, pale, breathless, evidently terribly dismayed\r\nand unwilling to face his master, who stood at the top of the steps,\r\nwhite with alarm and wrath.\r\n\r\n\'Sir,\' cried Gregorio, with a stammering of mixed languages, \'I have\r\nbeen searching everywhere!  I was going to give notice to the police.\r\nJe ferai tout!  Je le trouverai.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where did you lose him?\' demanded Mr. Egremont in a hoarse voice, such\r\nas Nuttie had never heard.\r\n\r\n\'In the Park, near the bridge over the Serpentine.  I was speaking for\r\na few moments to a friend.  Bah!  Il etait parti.  Mais je le\r\ntrouverai.  Parker, he seeks too.  Fear not, sir, I shall find him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Find him, you scoundrel, or never dare to see me again!  I\'ve borne\r\nwith your insolences long, and now you\'ve brought them to a height. Go,\r\nI say, find my boy!\' exclaimed Mr. Egremont, with a fierce oath and\r\npassionate gesture, and Gregorio vanished again.\r\n\r\n\'Bring the carriage--no, call a cab;\' commanded Mr. Egremont, snatching\r\nup his hat.  \'Who is this Parker?\'\r\n\r\nThe servants hesitated, but the butler said he believed the man to be a\r\nfriend of Gregorio\'s employed at one of the clubs.  Nuttie meanwhile\r\nbegging her father not to go without her, flew upstairs to put on her\r\nhat, and coming down at full speed found that Mr. Dutton, passing by\r\nand seeing the open door and the terrified servants on the steps, had\r\nturned in to ask what was the matter, and was hearing in no measured\r\nterms from Mr. Egremont how the child had been taken away from his\r\nnurse and lost in the Park while that scamp Gregorio was chattering to\r\nsome good-for-nothing friend.\r\n\r\nTo Nuttie\'s great relief, Mr. Dutton offered to go with the father to\r\nassist in the search, and the coachman, far too anxious and excited to\r\nlet his master go without him in a cab, contrived to bring up the\r\ncarriage.  Some of the servants were ordered off to the various police\r\noffices.  Poor nurse, who was nearly distracted, started in a hansom on\r\nher own account, persuaded that she should see and recognise traces of\r\nher darling at the scene of his loss, and she almost raced the\r\ncarriage, which was bound for the same spot.\r\n\r\nSluggish natures like Mr. Egremont\'s can sometimes be roused to great\r\nviolence, and then pour forth the long pent-up accumulations kept back\r\nby indolence and indifference.  His only occupation during the rapid\r\ndrive was to vituperate his valet, the curse of his life, he said.  To\r\nhear him talk, it would have seemed as if Gregorio had been the tyrant\r\nwho had kept him in bondage all these years, fully aware of his\r\nfalsehood, peculation, and other rascality, but as unable to break the\r\nyoke as if he had been in truth the slave of anything but his own evil\r\nhabit and helpless acquiescence.\r\n\r\nWould it last if Gregorio made his appearance at that instant with\r\nAlwyn in his hand?  Or even, as Mr. Dutton confidently predicted, a\r\npoliceman might bring the boy home, before many hours were passed. The\r\nchief doubt here was that Alwyn\'s defective pronunciation, which had\r\nbeen rather foolishly encouraged, might make it difficult to understand\r\nhis mode  of saying his own name, or even that of the street, if he\r\nknew it perfectly; but the year he had been absent from London had\r\nprevented him from acquiring the curious ready local instinct of the\r\ntrue town child, and he had been so much guarded and watched that he\r\nwas likely to be utterly at a loss when left alone; and Nuttie was\r\nwretched at the thought of his terror and loneliness, even while Mr.\r\nDutton told her of speedy recoveries of lost children through kind\r\npeople or the police.\r\n\r\nThey found all the officials of the Park already aware and on the\r\nalert, and quite certain of the impossibility of nurse\'s prime dread\r\nthat the boy had fallen into the water unseen by any one and been\r\ndrowned.  She was even ready to look into every bush, in case he had\r\nbeen frightened and hidden himself; and nothing would satisfy her but\r\nto stay making these researches, when her master had decided on\r\nendeavouring to find \'Parker\' at the club, and to ascertain from him\r\nparticulars of time and place.\r\n\r\nHe was found there.  The dinner-hour had brought him back, he being a\r\nman in authority there, very well dressed and deferential, declaring\r\nhimself immensely distressed at the occurrence, and at having accosted\r\nGregorio and attracted his attention.  It was about four o\'clock, he\r\nthought, and he described the exact spot where the little boy had been\r\nsailing his vessel fastened to a string.  They might have been talking\r\ntwenty minutes or half an hour when Gregorio missed his charge, and\r\nsince that time both had been doing all in their power to find him,\r\nuntil half-past seven, when he had to return to his club, and Gregorio\r\nwent to see whether the child had been taken home.\r\n\r\nBy this time Mr. Egremont looked so utterly exhausted, that Mr. Dutton\r\navailed himself of the hope that the boy might be found safe at home to\r\ntake him back; but alas! nothing had been heard there.\r\n\r\nThe poor man was in a restless, unmanageable state of excitement,\r\nalmost as terrifying to his daughter as the distress that occasioned\r\nit.  He swallowed a tumblerful of claret, but would not eat nor go to\r\nbed; and indeed, Gregorio alone having had the personal charge of him,\r\nlatterly sleeping in his dressing-room, none of the other servants knew\r\nwhat to do for him.  Mr. Dutton agreed with her that it would be better\r\nto send for his doctor, as probably he ought to have a sedative, and\r\nneither would take the responsibility of giving it; while he himself\r\ndeclared he neither would nor could rest till he had his boy again.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was dining out, and they had two terrible hours; while Mr.\r\nEgremont paced to the windows; threw himself on the sofa; denounced\r\nGregorio; or, for a change, all the system of police which had made no\r\ndiscovery; and Ursula for letting the boy be so helpless.  Mr. Dutton\r\nsometimes diverted his attention for a few minutes, and hoped he would\r\ndoze, but the least sound brought him to his feet again, and the only\r\ncongenial occupation was the composition of a description of poor\r\nlittle Alwyn\'s person and dress, which set Nuttie crying so\r\nuncontrollably, that she had to run out of the room.\r\n\r\nDr. Brownlow came at last, and was very kind and helpful, taking the\r\ncommand, and insisting that Mr. Egremont should go to bed, and take the\r\ndose which he mixed.  Broadbent, the butler, was to take Gregorio\'s\r\nplace, but he was a ponderous man, without much tact, and unused to the\r\nvalet\'s office.  \'I might just as well have a rhinoceros about me,\'\r\nsaid Mr. Egremont, in a fit of irritation; and it ended, Nuttie hardly\r\nknew how, in Mr. Dutton\'s going upstairs to smooth matters.  He came\r\ndown after a time and said: \'I am not satisfied to leave him alone or\r\nto Broadbent; I have his consent to my sleeping in the dressing-room.\r\nI am just going home to fetch my things.  Let me find you gone when I\r\ncome back.  You will hear no more to-night.  Even if he is found, they\r\nwill keep him till morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is of no use; I can\'t sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'Even if you don\'t, the mere restful position will make you fitter for\r\nthe morrow.  Will you promise me to undress and really go to bed?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes! if you say I must,\' said Nuttie drearily; following an\r\ninstinct of obedience.\r\n\r\n\'And remember,\' he said, \'though I do not say it will be so, this may\r\nbe deliverance from bondage.\'\r\n\r\n\'But what a terrible deliverance!\'\r\n\r\n\'Bonds are not burst without something terrible.  No; don\'t be\r\nfrightened.  Remember there is safekeeping for that sweet little\r\nfellow, wherever he may be.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Mr. Dutton, if I could pray for him; but the turmoil seems to have\r\ndriven away all such things!  My boy, my boy, where is he now? Who has\r\nheard him say his little prayers?\'\r\n\r\n\'His Heavenly Father has; of that we may be secure.  You will feel it\r\nin the quiet of your own room.  Good-night.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I shall know you are praying, better than I can,\' murmured Nuttie,\r\nas she returned his good-night, and crept up to her chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nFETTERS RENT.\r\n\r\n  \'The gods are just, and of our pleasant sins\r\n  Make whips to scourge us.\'--King Lear.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no real sleep for Ursula that short summer night.  She saw\r\nthe early dawn, listened to the distant roll of market-carts, and\r\nwondered when it would be reasonable to be afoot, and ready to hear, if\r\naught there was to hear.  At any hour after seven, surely the finders\r\nwould have mercy and bring the welcome news.  And just before seven she\r\nfell asleep, deeply, soundly, and never woke till past eight, but that\r\nwas just enough to revive the power of hope, and give the sense of a\r\nnew day.  But there was nothing to hear--no news.  She found Mr. Dutton\r\nin the dining-room.  He had had to administer another draught to her\r\nfather, and had left him in a sleep which would probably last for some\r\ntime.  If she would go and sit in the outer room, after her breakfast,\r\nhe would go out to obtain intelligence.\r\n\r\n\'You must have some breakfast,\' she said, ringing the bell, and\r\nwistfully looking over the blinds; then exclaiming: \'Oh, there\'s Mark!\r\nHas he heard anything?\' and out she darted, opening the door before he\r\nrang.  \'Mark! have you found him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' he said gravely, looking utterly amazed as she clasped her\r\nhands, and seemed ready to fling herself on his neck with joy.  \'I came\r\nbecause it will be a great shock to my uncle.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then it is so!  Nurse was right,\' said Nuttie, turning deadly pale,\r\nand standing as if before a firing platoon.  \'Tell me, Mark, where did\r\nthey find him?\'\r\n\r\n\'At the Faringdon Station.  I was sent for to identify him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stay,\' said Mr. Dutton, as there was a wild horrified look in Nuttie\'s\r\neyes.  \'Do you mean little Alwyn?\'\r\n\r\n\'Little Alwyn!  No, certainly not.  What of him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Gregorio managed to lose him in the park yesterday,\' put in Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'That accounts for it, then,\' said Mark.  \'No, it was Gregorio himself,\r\npoor man.  He was knocked down by the engine, and killed on the spot,\r\njust by the station, at eleven o\'clock last night.  Our name was found\r\non him, and I was sent for early this morning.  There was no doubt\r\nabout it, so I came on here at once to let my uncle know, little\r\nthinking--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it is dreadful!\' cried Nuttie, sinking into a chair.  \'Do you\r\nremember, my father told him never to see his face again unless he\r\nfound Alwyn?\'\r\n\r\nBroadbent came in at the moment with the coffee-pot, and stood\r\nsuspended, as he was told what had happened, Mark adding the detail:\r\n\'He was crossing the line in front of the engine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' said the butler.  \'It is an awful dispensation.  No doubt\r\nhe knew it was all up with him.  You may not be aware, sir, of the\r\nsubject of his conversation in the park.  Mr. Parker had just seen a\r\ntelegram of the result of the Derby, and he had heavy bets on Lady\r\nEdina.  I am afraid, sir, there can be no doubt that he found a\r\nvoluntary grave.\'\r\n\r\n\'We will not talk of that.  We cannot judge,\' said Mark, shuddering. \'I\r\nsaid I would send some one from here to arrange what was to be done\r\nafter the inquest.\'\r\n\r\nBroadbent immediately undertook to go, if his master did not require\r\nhim, and this was thought advisable, as his services were certainly not\r\nacceptable to Mr. Egremont.  Mark had thought himself likely to be\r\ndetained and had provided for his absence, and the awe-stricken trio\r\nwere consulting together over the breakfast-table, eating mechanically,\r\nfrom the very exhaustion of agitation, when the door opened, and Mr.\r\nEgremont in his dressing-gown was among them, exclaiming: \'You are\r\nkeeping it from me.\'  He had been wakened by the whispers and rushes of\r\nthe excited maids, had rung his bell in vain, dressed himself as best\r\nhe could after so many years of dependence, and stumbled downstairs,\r\nwhere, as with his daughter, it was something like a relief to know\r\nthat hope was not extinguished in Alwyn\'s case.  But Mr. Egremont was\r\nin a very trembling, broken condition, and much overcome by his valet\'s\r\nend after so many years of intimate association.  Certainly, if either\r\nof the others had so parted with the man, it would have been a horror\r\nin the recollection, but he did not seem to dwell on it; and, indeed,\r\nattention was distracted by every sound at the door, since each might\r\nbring news of the missing child.\r\n\r\nOne of these tantalising rings proved to be a policeman with poor\r\nGregorio\'s keys, and a demand for an investigation into any papers he\r\nmight have left which would show his state of mind.  Mr. Egremont was\r\nvery much annoyed, declaring that he would have no stranger meddle with\r\nthem, and that he saw no use in such prying.  What difference could it\r\nmake to any living creature?  However, when he found there was no help\r\nfor it, he said he must do it himself. Nuttie offered to help, but was\r\nsharply, strongly refused.  Mark alone might and should help.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Dutton volunteered to go and explain matters to Mr. Dobbs, so\r\nas to get freedom for Mark for at least the remainder of the day. He\r\nwould call at the police offices and see what was doing in the search,\r\nput forward the advertisements, and obtain that the Serpentine should\r\nbe dragged, for he saw that only that measure would remove one great\r\nterror from these anxious hearts.\r\n\r\n\'And,\' he said to Mark, \'with your permission, I will bring back Mrs.\r\nEgremont and the children if they will do me the honour to become my\r\nguests.  She will be a comfort to Miss Egremont, and then you will be\r\nat hand in the evening.\'\r\n\r\nMark could only be thankful, and presently addressed himself to the\r\ninvestigation, which his uncle insisted should be made in his own\r\npresence, though the opiate kept him for the most part dozing in an\r\narm-chair, only rousing up now and then by some noise at the front\r\ndoor, or putting queries, the replies to which startled him more and\r\nmore, as he grew more wakeful and Mark proceeded.\r\n\r\nAll, except a few unimportant bills and a betting-book, was locked into\r\na dressing-case that had once belonged to Mr. Egremont, and had tricks\r\nof secret drawers that only he could explain.  It was full of papers,\r\nand they were a strange revelation that Mr. Egremont might well wish to\r\nwithhold from his daughter.  They went very far back, and of course did\r\nnot come out in order of chronology, nor would Mark have understood\r\nthem but for exclamations and comments here and there from his uncle.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to be there,--the old passport and certificate to\r\nGregorio Savelli, when he left his Savoyard home to be a waiter at a\r\nhotel; a few letters in Italian, probably from his parents, which Mark\r\ncould not read, but which soon ceased; the counter-signed character\r\nwith which he had entered General Egremont\'s service; and then came a\r\nnote or two signed A. P. E., which Mr. Egremont regarded with great\r\nannoyance, though they only consisted of such phrases as \'Back on\r\nWednesday.  Find an excuse,\' or in French, \'Envoyez moi la petite\r\nboite!\'  \'Que la porte soit ouverte apres minuit.\'\r\n\r\n\'That was the way,\' groaned Mr. Egremont.  \'The scoundrel! he kept all\r\nthose to be able to show me up to the General if he chose!  I was a\r\nyoung man then, Mark, not the straitlaced lad you\'ve always been. And\r\nthe General!  A bad old dog he was, went far beyond what I ever did,\r\nbut for all that he had no notion of any one going any way but his own,\r\nand wanted to rein me in as tight as if he had been an epitome of all\r\nthe virtues.  And Gregorio seemed a good-natured young fellow then, and\r\nmade things easy for me, though no doubt he meant to have me in his\r\nhands, in case I tried to shake him off.\'\r\n\r\nAnother discovery affected him far more.  It was of a letter in Alice\'s\r\nhandwriting, addressed to Captain Egremont, in the yacht Ninon--poste\r\nrestante, Madeira.  He had never seen it, never known of its existence;\r\nGregorio had gone to inquire for the letters, and had suppressed it.\r\nMr. Egremont had wondered how he had become aware of the marriage.  His\r\nknowledge had from that time been used as a means of enforcing the need\r\nof a good understanding with the heir.  Mr. Egremont was much moved by\r\nthe sight of the letter, and its date, from Dieppe, about six months\r\nafter he had left his young wife there. He made Mark give it to him\r\nunread, handled it tenderly, struggled to read the delicate pointed\r\nwriting to himself, but soon deferred the attempt, observing, \'There,\r\nthere, I can\'t stand it now!  But you see, Mark,\' he added after an\r\ninterval, \'I was not altogether the heartless brute you thought me.\'\r\n\r\nMark, as he told his wife afterwards, could not help thinking of the\r\nold preamble to indictments, \'By the temptation of the devil.\'\r\n\r\nAnd by and by, out of a pocket-book bearing the date of the General\'s\r\ndeath, came a copy of the certificate of the baptism of Ursula Alice,\r\ndaughter of Alwyn Piercefield and Alice Egremont, together with that\r\naddress which Miss Headworth had left at Dieppe to gratify Alice\'s\r\nforlorn idea of a possible rescue, and which Gregorio had asseverated\r\nto be non-existent.\r\n\r\nDoubtless he infinitely preferred his master\'s wandering bachelor life\r\nto the resumption of marriage ties, and thus he had contrived to keep\r\nMr. Egremont from meeting the Houghtons at Florence.  At the same time\r\nthe uncertainty as to Alice\'s fate had prevented any other marriage.\r\nGregorio had taken care that, if Mr. Egremont had been villain enough\r\nto make such an attempt, he should know that his secret could be\r\nbrought to light.\r\n\r\nCompared with all this wickedness, the proofs of fraud and dishonesty\r\nwere entirely unimportant.  Gambling had evidently been a passion with\r\nthe valet, and peculation had followed, and Mark could have traced out\r\nthe full tide before the reinstatement of Mrs. Egremont in her home,\r\nthe gradual ebb during her reign, the diminished restraint under her\r\ndaughter.  The other servants had formerly been implicated, but, except\r\na young groom and footman, Mark thought the present set quite free from\r\nthe taint, and was glad to acquit Broadbent.  But the last telegrams\r\nand the betting-book in the unhappy man\'s pocket confirmed Parker\'s\r\nevidence that of late he had staked almost madly, and had risked sums\r\nfar beyond any means he could raise upon the horse which had failed.\r\nThe bailiff at Bridgefield had, it had long been guessed, played into\r\nhis hands, but to what an extent Mark only now discovered.\r\n\r\nThe result was that what he had learnt in the Park had so astounded him\r\nthat his inattention to the child had not been wonderful.  He had--as\r\nParker testified--sought the little fellow vehemently, and had he been\r\nsuccessful, he might yet have made some effort, trusting to his\r\nmaster\'s toleration; but the loss and reproach had made him an\r\nabsolutely desperate man.  Was it blind flight or self-destruction?\r\nThat he had money about him, having cashed a cheque of his master\'s,\r\nfavoured the first idea, and no one would too curiously inquire whether\r\nMr. Egremont was aware of the amount.\r\n\r\nIt was only too true that, as he had said, Gregorio Savelli had been\r\nthe curse of his life, having become one of the whips left by pleasant\r\nvices, and the breaking of the yoke had been not only at a terrible\r\nprice, but, to a man in his half-blind and invalid condition, the\r\nactual loss of the person on whom he had depended was a privation.  Dr.\r\nBrownlow, however, knew of a good man-servant just set at liberty by\r\nthe death of an invalid master, and promised to send him on trial.\r\n\r\nIt was a day of agitations and disappointments, a sample of many that\r\nwere to follow.  There was not a sound of a bell that did not make\r\nanxious hearts throb.  And oh! how many were spent on vain reports, on\r\nmere calls of sympathy by acquaintance whom the father and sister could\r\nnot see, and on notes of inquiry or condolence that Nuttie had to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nAnnaple came and was a great help and support to her.  Poor nurse,\r\noblivious of her bad foot, or perhaps, willing to wreak vengeance on it\r\nas the cause of all the mischief, had insisted on continuing her search\r\nin the morning under all the thorns and rhododendrons where she thought\r\nthe dear lamb might have hidden and cried himself to sleep, and at last\r\nhad been brought home in a cab quite worn out and despairing.  But the\r\nscreaming baby proved to be a much better comforter to her than any\r\namount of reasonable argument.  To soothe it, to understand what ailed\r\nit, to find suitable food for it, was an occupation which made the\r\nsuspense less intolerable.  The very handling of an infant would have\r\nbeen congenial; and a sickly crying one was only too interesting.\r\nWillie was too near her darling\'s age to be a welcome sight, but he was\r\nalready a prime pet with the servants at Springfield; and Annaple,\r\nsecure that her children were in safe and experienced hands, and\r\noverflowing with motherly sympathy for the grievous loss, was ready to\r\ndevote herself to Nuttie, whether by talk, by letter writing, or by\r\nseeing inquiring friends.  She did not expect to be of any use to Mr.\r\nEgremont, who had always held aloof from and disliked \'the giggling\r\nScotch girl,\' but who came drearily wandering at an unexpected time\r\ninto the room where she was sitting with his daughter, and presently\r\nwas involved in their conversation.  Whether it was the absence of the\r\npoor familiar, or that Annaple was no longer a giggling girl, but a\r\nbrave, cheerful wife and mother, it was certain that he found the same\r\ncomfort and support in her presence as did Nuttie.  When fits of\r\nrestless misery and despair pressed hardest upon him, it was soon\r\nperceived that Annaple\'s cheerful tact enabled her to deal with him as\r\nno one else could do.  There was the restraint of courtesy towards her,\r\nsuch as had worn out towards his daughter, and besides her sanguine\r\noptimist spirit never became so depressed as did poor Nuttie\'s.  Mark\r\nwent by day to his work, but came back to dine at his uncle\'s, hear the\r\nreports, and do what he could for him; and meantime Annaple spent the\r\nchief part of the day in aiding Nuttie and Mr. Egremont, while her baby\r\nreally showed signs of improvement in nurse\'s keeping.  And so the days\r\nwent on, while every endeavour was made to trace the child, but with no\r\nresult but bitter disappointment.  Twice, strayed children, younger\r\nthan Alwyn--one even a girl--were brought as the lost boy, and the\r\nadvertisements bore fruit in more than one harassing and heartless\r\ncorrespondence with wretches who professed to be ready to restore the\r\nchild, on promises of absolute secrecy, and sums of money sent\r\nbeforehand, with all sorts of precautions against interference from the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nThe first of these created great excitement, and the pursuit was\r\ncommitted to Mr. Dutton.  When it proved abortive, Mr. Egremont\'s\r\ndisappointment and anger were great, and he could not be persuaded that\r\nall was not the fault of Mr. Dutton\'s suspicion and precaution in\r\nholding back the money, nor could any one persuade him that it was mere\r\nimposture.  When another ill-written enigmatical letter arrived, he\r\ninsisted that it was from the same quarter, and made Broadbent conduct\r\nthe negotiations, with the result that after considerable sums had been\r\npaid in circuitous fashions, the butler was directed to a railway arch\r\nwhere the child would be deposited, and where he found a drab-coloured\r\nbrat of whom he disposed at the nearest police station, after which he\r\ncame home savagely disgusted.\r\n\r\nNuttie was not much less so at what she felt as a slight to Mr. Dutton\r\nas well as at the failure.  \'When you are doing so much for us.  We\r\ndeserve that you should do nothing more,\' she said with tears shining\r\nin her eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Do not talk in that way,\' he answered.  \'You know my feeling for the\r\ndear little fellow himself, and--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes,\' interrupted Nuttie, \'I do trust to that!  Nobody--not the\r\nmost indifferent person, but must long to save him.  Yes, I know it was\r\ndoing you a wicked injustice to fancy that you could take offence in\r\nthat way at a father in such trouble.  Please forgive me, Mr. Dutton.\'\r\n\r\n\'As if I had anything to forgive.  As if there were anything on earth\r\nthat could come before the endeavour to recover him,\' said Mr. Dutton,\r\ntoo much moved for his usual precision of speech.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; he is _her_ child,\' said Nuttie, with a trembling tearful smile.\r\n\r\n\'_Her_ child!  Yes, and even if he were not, he is _your_ brother,\'\r\nsaid Mr. Dutton; then hastily gathering himself up, as if he had said\r\ntoo much, he rose to take leave, adding as their hands clasped,\r\n\'Remember, as long as I live, you may count upon me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I know, I know!  There\'s nobody like you, but I don\'t know what I\r\nsay in this awful suspense.  If I had only seen him lying white and\r\ncold and peaceful, it would have been far better than to think of him\r\npining and miserable among wicked people, who would try to bring him up\r\nlike themselves.  Mother\'s own little boy!\'\r\n\r\n\'It will not be allowed, it will not be allowed,\' cried Mr. Dutton.\r\n\'God\'s Providence is still over him.\'\r\n\r\n\'And there are prayers, I know--at our church and Mr. Godfrey\'s-and all\r\nours, but oh! it takes a great deal of faith to lean on them.  I wonder\r\nif you would, Annaple, if it were Willy?\'\r\n\r\n\'We will not ask Mrs. Egremont,\' said Mr. Dutton, as Annaple made a\r\ngesture of something like doubt.\r\n\r\n\'It is almost as bad,\' said she, coming up and putting her arm round\r\nNuttie.  \'But indeed, Mr. Dutton, she does trust, only it is very, very\r\nsore, for her,--as it is for us all.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are her great comfort,\' said Mr. Dutton, as he shook hands with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\'He could hardly help thanking me,\' said Annaple to her husband\r\nafterwards.  \'Mr. Egremont may well call him an adopted uncle.  I\r\nshould say he was a good deal more, poor man.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE HULL OF THE URSULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen days had passed, and Mark and Annaple were thinking that they ought\r\nto return to ordinary life, and leave the bereaved ones to endeavour to\r\nconstruct their life afresh under the dreadful wearing uncertainty of\r\ntheir darling\'s fate.  Still they were detained by urgent entreaties\r\nfrom father and daughter, who both dreaded their departure as\r\nadditional desolation, and as closing the door of hope. And certainly,\r\neven this rest was good for Annaple; and her baby, for whom nurse had\r\ndiscovered a better system, had really not cried more for a whole day\r\nthan \'befitted a rational child,\' said the mother, as she walked back\r\nto Springfield with her husband in the summer night, after dinner, on\r\nthe day that Broadbent\'s negotiations had failed.\r\n\r\n\'Nurse will break her heart at parting with her,\' said Mark.  \'I wish\r\nwe could afford to have her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Afford, indeed!  Her wages are about a quarter of your salary, sir!\r\nAnd after all, \'tis not the nurse that guards the child, as we have\r\nseen only too plainly.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think he is alive, Nan?\'\r\n\r\n\'I begin to think not.  He is not so young but that he could make\r\nhimself known, and those advertisements are so widely spread.  I am\r\nsure poor Nuttie would be more at rest if she could give up hope.\'\r\n\r\n\'I did not tell you before, Nan, but Dutton was going to-day to look at\r\na poor little unclaimed child\'s body that had been found in the Thames.\r\nHe knew him better than I, so he went.\'\r\n\r\n\'He would have come if--\' said Annaple.\r\n\r\n\'Assuredly.  He meant to fetch nurse if he had any doubt, but\r\nafterwards he was going to his court about his rents.  He always does\r\nthat on Saturday evenings.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton himself opened his door to the pair.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Mark.\r\n\r\n\'Certainly not.  The poor child was evidently much younger, and had red\r\nhair.  But look here,\' and he held out a battered something, black with\r\na white stripe.  Mark understood nothing, but Annaple exclaimed, \'Is it\r\nhis ship?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I could swear to it, for see,\' and he pointed to some grimed,\r\nalmost effaced, but still legible capitals, which, however, scarcely\r\nany one but himself could have read as "Ursula."  \'I guided his hand to\r\nmake those the evening before he was lost,\' said Mr. Dutton.\r\n\r\n\'Dear little man!  And where did you find it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Where I never thought of doing so!  On the bed of a little crippled\r\nboy in the next court to mine.  He is rather a friend of mine, and I\r\nturned in to take him some strawberries.  I found him hugging this.\'\r\n\r\n\'How did he get it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Our "Liz" brought it to him.  Our "Liz" is a very wild specimen, who\r\nhas spent her life in eluding the school board officer till she is too\r\nold for his clutches; but she has a soft spot in her heart for her\r\nlittle brother, and I believe another for Gerard Godfrey.  We must be\r\nvery cautious, and not excite any alarm, or we shall be baffled\r\naltogether.  I am not sure that I did quite prudently in giving little\r\nAlf a fresh boat in exchange for this; but I could not help bringing it\r\nhome.\'\r\n\r\n\'You did not see the girl?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.  Those girls wander long and late on these hot nights, and I do\r\nnot think I could have got anything out of her.  I have been to Gerard\r\nGodfrey, and the next step must be left to him.\'\r\n\r\n\'The next question is whether you will tell those poor things at No.\r\n5,\' said Mark.\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton hesitated.  \'I should have no doubt of giving Miss Egremont\r\nthe comfort of knowing that there was a possible clue, but if her\r\nfather insisted on setting on the police, there would be very little\r\nmore hope of success.  I am afraid it will be more prudent to wait till\r\nwe know what Godfrey says.  He hopes to see the girl to-morrow evening\r\nat his mission class, but of course she is a very uncertain attendant\r\nthere.  No, I cannot trust myself.\'\r\n\r\nAnnaple was forced to brook withholding the hope from the fainting\r\nhearts all the ensuing Sunday, which was a specially trying day, as\r\nNuttie pined for her dear little companion with the pictures, stories,\r\nand hymns that he had always enjoyed, and made pretty childish remarks\r\nabout, such as she began to treasure as memorable.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could, early on Monday morning, Mr. Dutton repaired to\r\nGerard Godfrey\'s lodgings, and found that the young clergyman had\r\nsucceeded in seeing the girl, and had examined her so as not to put the\r\nwild creature on her guard, and make her use the weapons of falsehood\r\ntowards one who had never been looked on as an ally of the police.  It\r\nappeared that she had brought home the ship, or rather its hull, from\r\none of the lowest of lodging houses, where she had employment as\r\nsomething between charwoman and errand girl.  She had found it on what\r\npassed for a bed in its present condition, one morning, when going to\r\nmake the extremely slight arrangements that the terrible lair, which\r\nserved as a common bedroom, underwent, and had secreted it as a prize\r\nfor her little brother.\r\n\r\nAt first she had been stolid, and affected utter ignorance as to how it\r\ngot there, but Mr. Godfrey had entreated her as a friend to try to\r\ndiscover; and had with all his heart made a pathetic description of the\r\ngirl (he durst not say lady) who had always been a mother to her little\r\nbrother, and now had lost him, and was in terrible uncertainty as to\r\nhis fate.  That came home to Lizzie\'s feelings, and she let out what\r\nshe had seen or picked up in the way of gossip,--that the ship had been\r\nleft behind by its owner, whether boy or girl Liz was uncertain, for it\r\nhad long fair hair, wore a petticoat, and had been dosed with gin and\r\nsomething else when carried away.  They said it had made noise enough\r\nwhen brought there by Funny Frank and Julia. They were performing folk,\r\nwho had come in after the Derby day to have a spree, and to pick up\r\nanother kid to do fairies and such like, because the last they had had\r\nhurt his back and had to be left in the workhouse.  Yes, she had heard\r\ntell that they had got the child from Mother Bet, of whom Gerard had a\r\nvague idea as one of the horrible hags, who not only beg themselves,\r\nbut provide outfits for beggars, including infants, to excite\r\ncompassion.  Either she or one of her crew had picked up the child and\r\ndisposed of his clothes; and then finding him too old and intelligent\r\nto be safely used for begging purposes, she had sold or hired him out\r\nto these acrobatic performers, who had gone off into that vague and\r\nunknown region, the country.  Liz had no notion what was their real\r\nname, nor where they would go, only that they attended races and fairs;\r\nand as soon as the actual pleasure of communicating information was\r\nover, she was seized with a panic, implored Mr. Godfrey to make no use\r\nof her information, and explained that the people of the house were\r\nquite capable of killing her, if they suspected her of betraying any of\r\ntheir transactions.  It was impossible to bring any authorities to bear\r\non the quest; and Mr. Dutton held it wisest only to write a note\r\ntelling Mr. Egremont that he had obtained evidence that the child was\r\nliving, and that he was going in pursuit, but thought it safer to say\r\nno more at present.  He gave the note to Mark at his office.  \'I cannot\r\ntrust myself to see your cousin,\' he said.  \'I might be tempted to say\r\nmore than was consistent with Godfrey\'s honour towards his informant.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think you are right,\' said Mark.  \'You had better leave me with only\r\nindefinite knowledge, for I shall be hard pressed.  Do you not go home\r\nfirst?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I go to pack up a few things and fetch Monsieur.  A run in the\r\ncountry will do him good, and he may be a valuable auxiliary.  I shall\r\nfind no one at Springfield at this hour.\'\r\n\r\n\'What is your plan?\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall venture so far as to apply to the police for the names of the\r\nusual attendants at races and fairs, and for some idea of their\r\nordinary rounds.  I have no doubt that these are known at the chief\r\noffices.  For the rest, I must use my eyes.  But tell your cousin that,\r\nwith God\'s blessing, I hope to bring him back to her.\'\r\n\r\n\'He will,\' said Ursula, when Mark gave her the message, and from that\r\nmoment she was calmer.  She did not fret Mark with questions even as\r\nmuch as Annaple did, she tried to prevent her father from raging at the\r\nscant information, and she even endeavoured to employ herself with some\r\nof her ordinary occupations, though all the time she kept up the\r\nceaseless watch.  \'Mr. Dutton would not have said that without good\r\nhope,\' she averred, \'and I trust to him.\'\r\n\r\nYet when four, five, six, eight, days had passed with no tidings, the\r\nheart sickness grew almost more than she could bear, though she still\r\nanswered with spirit when her father again took to abusing the\r\numbrella-fellow for choosing to keep all in his own hands.\r\n\r\nEven Annaple could not help saying to her husband that a precise, prim,\r\nold bachelor was the very last person for a hunt in slums and the like.\r\nThe very sight of him would put the people on their guard. \'And think\r\nof his fine words,\' she added.  \'I wish I could go!  If I started with\r\na shawl over my head, yoked to a barrel-organ, I should have a far\r\nbetter chance than he will.  I declare, Mark, if he does not succeed\r\nwe\'ll do it.  We\'ll hire an organ, whereon you shall play.  Ah! you\r\nshake your head.  A musical education is not required, and I know I\r\nshall do something desperate soon, if that dear little boy is not\r\nfound.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nNUTTIE\'S KNIGHT.\r\n\r\n  \'The night came on and the bairnies grat,\r\n  Their minnie aneath the mools heard that.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'LYNDHURST, 4th July.--Philip Dutton to Miss Egremont.  Found.\r\nWaterloo, 6.15.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'I knew he would,\' said Nuttie, with a strange quietness, but as she\r\ntried to read it to her father her voice choked, and she had to hand it\r\nto Annaple.  But for the first time in her life she went up and\r\nvoluntarily kissed her father\'s forehead.  And perhaps it was for the\r\nfirst time in his life that the exclamation broke from him, \'Thank God!\'\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was well that the telegram had not come earlier in the day,\r\nfor Mr. Egremont was very restless, showing himself much shaken in\r\nnerves and spirits before the time for driving to the station, which he\r\ngreatly antedated.  Nuttie could hardly keep him in the carriage, and\r\nindeed had to persuade him to return thither, when he had once sprung\r\nout on the arrival of a wrong train.\r\n\r\nAnd after all, when the train did come, his blue spectacles were\r\ndirected to the row of doors at the other end, and Nuttie was anxiously\r\ntrying to save him from being jostled, when a voice said \'Here!\' and\r\nclose beside them stood Mr. Dutton, with a little boy by his side who\r\nlooked up in her face and said \'Sister!\'  It was said in a dreamy,\r\nalmost puzzled way, not with the ecstatic joy Nuttie had figured to\r\nherself; and there was something passive in the mode of his hearing his\r\nfather\'s \'My boy, my boy!\'  Instinctively all turned to the harbour of\r\nthe carriage; Mr. Dutton lifted Alwyn in, and as Nuttie received him, a\r\npang shot across her, as she felt how light, how bony the little frame\r\nhad become in these three weeks.\r\n\r\n\'Come in!  Come back with us!  Tell us all!\' said Mr. Egremont, as Mr.\r\nDutton was about to help him in.\r\n\r\n\'My dog,\' said Mr. Dutton, while Alwyn looked up from nestling in\r\nNuttie\'s lap to say, \'Mithter Button come!  And Mothu!\'\r\n\r\n\'We have room for him,\' said Mr. Egremont graciously.  \'Here, poor\r\nfellow.\'\r\n\r\n\'He has the right,\' said Mr. Dutton, \'for he was the real finder.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Monsieur, curly and shiny, occupied with great dignity the back\r\nseat beside his master, while Alwyn, in a silent but dreamy content, as\r\nif he only half understood where he was, rested against his sister\'s\r\nbosom with his hands in his father\'s.\r\n\r\n\'Come, old chap,\' said his father cheerily, \'tell us all about it.\'\r\n\r\nBut Alwyn only shuddered a little, raised his eyelids slightly, and\r\ngave a tiny faint smile.\r\n\r\n\'I think he is very much tired,\' said Mr. Dutton.  \'There was a good\r\ndeal to be done to make him presentable this morning.  You must forgive\r\nme for sacrificing his curls, there was nothing else to be done with\r\nthem.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' and Nuttie looked again.  The boy was in a new, rather coarse,\r\nready-made, sailor suit that hung loosely upon his little limbs, his\r\nhair was short, and he was very pale, the delicate rosy flush quite\r\ngone, and with it the round outline of the soft cheek; and there were\r\npurple marks under the languid eyes.  She bent down and kissed him,\r\nsaying, \'Was Mr. Button nurse to you, Wynnie?\'\r\n\r\nHe smiled again and murmured, \'Mr. Button made me boy again.\'\r\n\r\nAfter a question and answer or two as to main facts of place and time\r\nof the discovery, Mr. Dutton told his story.  \'I did not effect much\r\nwith my inquiries after the circuses.  All I heard of were of too\r\nsuperior an order for kidnapping practices.  However, I thought the\r\nonly way would be to haunt fairs and races, and look at their\r\ncamp-followers.  At a place in Hertfordshire I saw a performance\r\nadvertised with several children as fairies, so I went to see it.  I\r\nwas soon satisfied that Alwyn was not there; but it struck me that I\r\nhad known the face of the prime hero, a fine handsome supple fellow,\r\nwho was called in the programme Herr Adalbert Steinfuggen, or some such\r\nname.  Well, it seemed that he knew me, for as I struggled out after a\r\nconsiderable interval, I heard myself accosted, "Mr. Dutton! Sir,\r\nsurely I have the honour of speaking to Mr. Dutton of Micklethwayte?"\r\nI assure you he was the very pink of politeness.  Do you remember, Miss\r\nEgremont, Abel Stone?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Abel Stone!  He was a choir boy at Micklethwayte, I remember! He\r\nwas very handsome, and had a splendid voice; but he was a real monkey\r\nfor mischief, and nobody could manage him but mother.  She was always\r\npleading that he should not be turned out, and at last he ran away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; he went off with a circus, and there he found his vocation, rose\r\nand throve, married the prima-donna, and is part owner.  He seems very\r\nrespectable, and was so friendly and affectionate that I ventured to\r\nconsult him; when, on hearing whom I was seeking, he became warmly\r\ninterested, and gave me just the information I wanted. He said he had\r\nlittle doubt that Funny Frank was a clown called Brag, with whom he had\r\nhad words some years back for misusing the children. He said he did not\r\nhold with harshness to the little ones in teaching them to do the\r\nfeats, which certainly were wonderful.  If they were frightened, they\r\nwere nervous and met with accidents; but make much of them, and they\r\nthought it all fun, and took a pride and pleasure in their\r\nperformances.  However this Brag, though a clever fellow, could not be\r\nhindered from bullying, and at last he went off with a girl of the\r\ntroupe and set up on their own account.  Stone, or whatever he pleases\r\nto call himself, had met them several times, but he spoke of them with\r\ngreat contempt as "low," and they did not frequent the same places as\r\nhe does.  However, he referred to one of his men, and found that they\r\nhad been at Epsom on the Derby day, and moreover, that there was a\r\nreport of them having lately narrowly escaped being in a scrape about a\r\nchild who had been injured.  There was no scruple as to advising me\r\nwhere to look for them, or as to the best means of detection.  Stone\r\nwas very indignant, and made me understand that all his young people\r\nwere either to the manner born, or willingly hired out by their\r\nparents.  I saw them in private life, and they looked happy and\r\nwell-fed, but that was no guarantee for Funny Frank.  Well, I followed\r\nhim up without success, trying each place Stone had set down for me,\r\ntill I came last night to Lyndhurst, a very pretty place in the New\r\nForest, where there is to be a fair to-morrow, beginning this\r\nafternoon.  Stone advised me to look about before the affair opened,\r\nwhile unpacking and arranging was going on. Well, after all, it was\r\nvery simple.  I strolled out with my dog round the field where the vans\r\nand booths were getting into order. There was what I thought a little\r\ngirl in a faded red petticoat sitting on the steps at the bottom of a\r\nyellow van with her head on her hands.\'\r\n\r\n\'That was me,\' said Alwyn, lighting up.  \'And Mothu came and kissed\r\nFan!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Mr. Dutton; \'I verily believe we might have missed one\r\nanother, but Monsieur ran up to him and, as I was actually whistling\r\nhim off, I heard a little voice say, "Mothu!  Mothu!" and saw they\r\nwere--well, embracing one another, and then came "Mithter Button,\r\nMithter Button, oh, take me home!\'"\r\n\r\nEager caressing hands were held out to Monsieur, who jumped off the\r\nseat to receive the pats and laudations lavished on his curly round\r\npate, and had to be reduced to order before Mr. Dutton could answer the\r\nquestion whether he had any further difficulty or danger.\r\n\r\n\'I took him up in my arms, and a handsome truculent-looking woman burst\r\nout on me, demanding what I was about with her child.  To which I\r\nanswered that she knew very well he was no such thing.  Her man came\r\nswaggering up, declaring impudently that I had better be off--but I\r\nbelieve he saw that the people who came round would not take his part,\r\nfor he gave in much more easily than I expected.  I explained as loud\r\nas I could that this was a gentleman\'s son who had been stolen from his\r\nnurse in the Park.  The man began to protest that they had found him\r\ndeserted, and taken him with them out of charity, requesting to be paid\r\nfor his keep.  So I thought it better to give them a sovereign at once,\r\nso as to have no further trouble, and get him away as fast as I could.\r\nThe woman came after me, making further demands, but the sight of a\r\npoliceman in the distance turned her back.  I went up to him and\r\nexplained.  I found he knew all about the loss and the reward, and\r\nlooked regretfully at my prize.  We went back to the hotel, where I set\r\nAlwyn to rights as well as I could, sent out for some clothes, such as\r\nthe place would produce, and which at least, as he says, made a boy of\r\nhim again.  I\'m afraid the process was rather trying from such\r\nunaccustomed hands, though he was very good, and he has been asleep\r\nalmost all the way home, and, his senses all as in a dream bound up.\'\r\n\r\nThe heaviness--whether weariness or content, still continued.  Alwyn\r\nseemed to find it too much trouble to talk, and only gave little\r\nsmiles, more like his mother than himself.  He clung quite desperately\r\nto his sister when Mark offered to lift him from the carriage, but\r\nnurse was close behind, and it was good to see the little arms\r\nstretched out, and the head laid on her shoulder, the hand put up to\r\nstroke her cheek, and the lips whispering \'Wyn\'s own nursie.\'  The\r\njubilant greeting and triumphant procession with which he was borne\r\nupstairs seemed almost to oppress him.  He appeared almost as if he was\r\nafraid of wakening from a happy dream, and his lively merriment seemed\r\nall gone; there were only beams of recognition and gladness at \'Wyn\'s\r\nown nursery, Wyn\'s own pretty cup,\' touching it as if to make sure that\r\nit was real, and pleased to see the twisted crusts, his special treat.\r\n\r\nBut he could not eat much of them, and soon laid his head down, as one\r\nweary, with the exhaustion of content; and nurse, who had allowed that\r\nMr. Dutton had, considering all things, done much for the outward\r\nrestoration of the daintiness of her recovered child, was impatient to\r\ngive him the hot bath and night\'s rest that was to bring back the\r\nbright joyous Alwyn.  So Nuttie only lingered for those evening prayers\r\nshe had yearned after so sorely.  When she held his mother\'s picture to\r\nhim to be kissed, he raised his eyes to her and said: \'Will she come to\r\nme at night now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Who, my darling?\'\r\n\r\n\'She, mother dear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Here\'s her picture, dear boy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not only the picture--she came out of it, when I cried, up on the\r\nnasty-smelling bundle in the van all in the dark.\'\r\n\r\n\'She came?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, she came, and made it so nice, and hushed me.  I wasn\'t afraid to\r\ngo to by-by when she came.  And she sang.  Sister, can\'t you sing like\r\nthat?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not here, I\'m afraid, dear, dear boy,\' she whispered, holding him so\r\ntight that he gave a little cry of \'It hurts.\'  Then came the prayers,\r\nnot a word forgotten, and the little voice joined in her murmured\r\nthanksgiving for bringing him home.\r\n\r\nShe was much moved and awe-stricken at these words of her little\r\nbrother; but she had to dress in haste for dinner, listening the while\r\nto her maid\'s rejoinings and vituperations of the wretches who had\r\nmaltreated the child.\r\n\r\nWhen she came down she found no one in the drawing-room but Mr. Dutton,\r\nwhom her father had asked to the happiest meal that had perhaps ever\r\nbeen eaten in that house.\r\n\r\nShe went towards him with winged steps in her white dress: \'Oh! Mr.\r\nDutton, we have not said half enough to you, but we never, never can.\'\r\n\r\nHe gave a curious, trembling half smile, as she held out her hands to\r\nhim, and said: \'The joy is great in itself,\' speaking in a very low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! I am so glad that you did it,\' cried Ursula.  \'It would not have\r\nbeen half so sweet to owe it to any one else.\'\r\n\r\n\'Miss Egremont, do you know what you are saying?\' he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t call me Miss Egremont!  You never used to.  Why should you?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not dared--\' he began.\r\n\r\n\'Dared!  Don\'t you know you always were our own Mr. Dutton--best,\r\nwisest friend of all, and now more than ever.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stay,\' he said, \'I cannot allow you in your fervour to say such things\r\nto me, unaware of the strength of feeling you are stirring within me.\'\r\n\r\n\'You! you!  Mr. Dutton!\' cried Nuttie, with a moment\'s recoil.  \'You\r\ndon\'t mean that you care for _me_.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know it is preposterous--\' he began.\r\n\r\n\'Preposterous!  Yes, that you should care one bit for silly, foolish,\r\nnaughty, self-willed me.  Oh, Mr. Dutton, you can\'t mean it!\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, I would have kept silence, and not disturbed you with my\r\npresumption, if--\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush!\' she cried.  \'Why, it makes me so glad and so proud, I don\'t\r\nknow what to do.  I didn\'t think anybody was good enough for\r\nyou--unless it was dear, dear mother--and that it should be me.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is true,\' he said gravely, \'my younger days were spent in a vain\r\ndream of that angel, then when all that was ended, I thought such\r\nthings were not for me; but the old feeling has wakened, it seems to me\r\nin greater force than ever, though I meant to have kept it in control--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I am glad you didn\'t!  It seems as if the world swam round with\r\nwonder and happiness,\' and she held his hand as if to steady herself,\r\nstarting however as Annaple opened the door saying, \'We\'ve been sending\r\ntelegrams with the good news.\'\r\n\r\nThen an arch light came into her bright eyes, but the others were\r\nbehind her, and she said no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nFOUND AND TAKEN.\r\n\r\n  \'The angels of the gateway\r\n    Bent softly to the child,\r\n  And stretched glad hands to take him\r\n    To the kingdom undefiled.\'--B. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Come up and see him,\' said Nuttie, as the dining-room door was shut.\r\n\'I must feast my eyes on him.\'\r\n\r\nAnnaple replied by throwing an arm round her and looking into her eyes,\r\nkissing her on each cheek, and then, as they reached the landing in the\r\nsummer twilight, waltzing round and round that narrow space with her.\r\n\r\n\'You ridiculous person!\' said Nuttie.  \'Do you mean that you saw!\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course I did; I\'ve seen ever so long--\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense!  That\'s impossible--\'\r\n\r\n\'Impossible to owls and bats perhaps, but to nothing else not to see\r\nthat there was one sole and single hero in the world to you, and that\r\nto him there was one single being in the world; and that being the\r\ncase---\'\r\n\r\n\'But, Annaple, you can\'t guess what he has always been to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! don\'t I know?--a sort of Archbishop of Canterbury and George\r\nHeriot rolled into one.  So much the more reason, my dear, I don\'t know\r\nwhen I\'ve been so glad in my life than that your good times should be\r\ncoming.\'\r\n\r\n\'They are come in knowing this!  It is only too wonderful,\' said\r\nNuttie, as they stood together among the plants in the little\r\nconservatory on the way upstairs.  \'I always thought it insulting to\r\nhim when they teased me about him.\'\r\n\r\n\'They did, did they?\'\r\n\r\n\'My father, incited by poor Gregorio.  Oh, Annaple! don\'t let any one\r\nguess till we know how my father will take it.  What is it, Ellen?\' as\r\nthe nursery-maid appeared on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\'If you please, ma\'am, Mrs. Poole would be glad if you are coming up to\r\nthe nursery.\'\r\n\r\nThey both hastened up and nurse came out to meet them in the day\r\nnursery, making a sign to Ellen to take her place by the cot, and\r\nwithholding the two ladies.  She made them come as far off as possible,\r\nand then said that she was not at all satisfied about Master Alwyn.\r\nThere had been the same drowsiness and disinclination to speak, and\r\nwhen she had undressed and washed him, he had seemed tender all over,\r\nand cried out and moaned as if her touch hurt him, especially on one\r\nside where, she felt convinced, there was some injury; but when she\r\nasked about it his eyes grew frightened and bewildered, and he only\r\ncried in a feeble sort of way, as if sobs gave him pain.\r\n\r\nShe had soothed him, and he had gone into his own bed with the same\r\ngentle languid gladness, but had presently begun moaning, and imploring\r\nin his sleep, wakening with screams and entreaties, \'Oh, I\'ll do it!\r\nI\'ll try!\' and she thought him very feverish.  Would it not be better\r\nthat a doctor should see him?\r\n\r\nNurse was always an alarmist, and Nuttie could not help thinking that\r\nto wake the child to see a stranger to-night would only add to his\r\nterror and distress, while Annaple declared her entire belief that\r\nthough no doubt the poor little fellow had been cruelly knocked about\r\nand bruised, a night\'s rest would probably restore his bright self, and\r\nmake all that was past only like a bad dream.  There was no judging\r\nto-night, and sleep was wonderful reparation to those little beings.\r\n\r\nThen however the moans and murmurs began again, and now the awakening\r\ncry.  They started forward, and as Nuttie came to the cot-side the\r\nchild threw himself into her bosom with, \'Sister!  Sister!  It is\r\nsister!\' but his eyes grew round with terror at sight of Annaple, and\r\nclinging tightly to Nuttie he gasped, \'Send her away! don\'t let her\r\ntouch me!  Fan\'s not here!\'\r\n\r\nTo tell him she was Cousin Annaple, Billy\'s mamma, had no effect; he\r\ndid not seem able to understand, and she could only retire--nurse being\r\nthus convinced that to let him see another stranger to-night would only\r\ndo further harm.  Nuttie and nurse succeeded in reassuring him that he\r\nwas safe at home and with them, and in hushing him off into what they\r\nhoped would be a quiet wholesome sleep in spite of the hot sultry\r\nnight, on which Annaple laid a good deal of the blame of his\r\nrestlessness and feverishness.\r\n\r\nNuttie only came down for a short time before the visitors went away;\r\nand then she wrote a note to Dr. Brownlow, which Mark promised to leave\r\nas he went to the city in the morning, Mr. Egremont, in his present\r\nrelief, pooh-poohing all fears, and backing up Annaple\'s belief in the\r\npowers of \'tired nature\'s soft restorer\'; but Mr. Dutton looked grave\r\nand said that he had remarked the extreme tenderness, but had hoped\r\nthat much was due to his own inexperience in handling little children.\r\nThe parting clasp of the hand had a world of meaning in it, and Nuttie\r\nopenly said that she hoped to tell him after matins at St. Michael\'s\r\nhow the boy was.  But she could not be there.  When she went upstairs\r\nat night the half-delirious terrors had returned, and there was another\r\ndifficult soothing and comforting before the child slept again.  Nurse\r\nfancied the unwonted presence might disturb him, and insisted on her\r\ngoing to her own room.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned in the morning it was to find that since daylight he\r\nhad been more quietly asleep; but there was a worn sunken look about\r\nhis face, and she could not be satisfied to leave him alone while the\r\nnurses stirred about and breakfasted.\r\n\r\nHe awoke smiling and happy; he looked about and said gladly, \'Wyn at\r\nhome!  Wyn\'s own nursery,\' but he did not want to get up; \'Wyn so\r\ntired,\' he said, speaking of himself in the baby form that he had for\r\nseveral months discarded, but he said his pretty \'thank you,\' and took\r\ndelight in breakfasting in his cot, though still in a subdued way, and\r\nshowing great reluctance to move or be touched.\r\n\r\nNuttie was sent for to report of him to his father, who would not hear\r\nfor a moment of anxiety, declaring that the boy would be quite well if\r\nthey let him alone, he only wanted rest, and insisting on following out\r\nhis intention of seeing a police superintendent to demand whether the\r\nkidnapping rascals could not be prosecuted.\r\n\r\nNeither by Nuttie nor nurse could much be extracted from the poor\r\nlittle fellow himself about his adventures.  He could not bear to think\r\nof them, and there was a mist of confusion over his mind, partly from\r\nweakness, partly, they also thought, from the drugged spirits with\r\nwhich he had been more than once dosed.  He dimly remembered missing\r\nGregorio in the park, and that he had tried to find his way home alone,\r\nbut some one, a big boy, he thought, had said he would show him the\r\nway, took hold of his hand, dragged him, he knew not where, into\r\ndreadful dirt and stench, and apparently had silenced him with a blow\r\nbefore stripping him.  But it was all very indistinct, he could not\r\ntell how Mother Bet got hold of him, and the being dressed in the rags\r\nof a girl had somehow loosed his hold of his own identity.  He did not\r\nseem at all certain that the poor little dirty petticoated thing who\r\nhad wakened in a horrible cellar, or in a dark jolting van who had been\r\ndubbed Fan, who had been forced by the stick to dance and twist and\r\ncompelled to drink burning, choking stuff, was the same with Alwyn in\r\nhis sailor suit or in his white cot.\r\n\r\nIt was Dr. Brownlow who at once detected that there had been much of\r\nthis dosing, and drew forth the fact.  It had probably been done\r\nwhenever it was expedient that he should be hidden, or unable to make\r\nany appeal to outsiders.  Alwyn was quite himself by day, and showed no\r\nunreasonable fear or shyness, but he begged not to be touched, and\r\nthough he tried to be good and manly, could not keep from cries and\r\nscreams when the doctor examined him.\r\n\r\nThen it came out.  \'It\'s where he kicked me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who?\'\r\n\r\n\'That man--master, she said I must call him.  He kicked poor little Fan\r\nwith his great heavy big boots--\'cause Fan would say Wyn\'s prayers.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who was Fan?\' asked the puzzled doctor.\r\n\r\n\'Himself,\' whispered Nuttie.  \'Alas! himself!\'\r\n\r\n\'Wyn was Fan,\' said Alwyn.  \'Fan\'s gone now!\'\r\n\r\n\'And did the man kick poor little Fan,\' repeated the doctor--\'here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh don\'t--don\'t!  It hurts so.  Master said he would have none of\r\nthat, and he kicked with his big boot.  Oh!  Fan couldn\'t dance one bit\r\nafter that.\'\r\n\r\nHe could not tell how long ago this had been.  He seemed to have lost\r\nall reckoning of days, and probably felt as if ages had past in Funny\r\nFrank\'s van, but Dr. Brownlow thought the injury could not be above two\r\nor three days old, and probably it accounted for there having been no\r\nmore obstructions put in the way of removing the child, since he had\r\nceased to be of use, and the discovery of the injury might have brought\r\nthe perpetrator into trouble.  Indeed, as it was, Mr. Egremont caused\r\nthe police to be written to, demanding the arrest of the man and woman\r\nBrag, but they had already decamped, and were never traced, which was\r\ndecidedly a relief to those who dreaded all that a prosecution would\r\nhave involved.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Brownlow became very grave over the injury.  He said it was a\r\nsurgical case, and he should like to have another opinion, enjoining\r\nthat the child should be kept in bed, and as quiet as possible, till he\r\ncould bring his friend in the afternoon, which was no difficult matter,\r\nfor Alwyn seemed to have no desire for anything but rest and the sight\r\nof his friends and his treasures, which were laid beside him to be\r\ngently handled and stroked but not played with.  Mothu and Mithter\r\nButton were among the friends he craved for, but he showed no desire to\r\nsee Billy-boy, and it was thought best to keep that young gentleman\'s\r\nrampant strength at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty was with his father, who declared they were all\r\ncroaking, and that the boy would be as well as ever to-morrow.  He went\r\nand sat by the cot, and talked merrily of the pony that Alwyn was to\r\nride, and the yachting they would have in the summer; and the little\r\nfellow smiled and was pleased, but went to sleep in the midst. Then Mr.\r\nEgremont went out, taking Annaple with him, because Nuttie would not go\r\ntill the doctors\' visit was over, though he declared that they were\r\ncertain not to come till long after her return from the drive.  He\r\nactually went to the dealer\'s, and had pony after pony paraded before\r\nthe carriage, choosing a charming toy Shetland at last, subject to its\r\nbehaviour with the coachman\'s little boy, while Annaple hopefully\r\nagreed with him that Alwyn would be on its back in another week.\r\n\r\nHe still maintained his opinion, outwardly at least, when he was met on\r\nhis return by Nuttie with a pale, almost thunderstruck face.  Dr.\r\nBrownlow had called her from trying to soothe away the fright and\r\nsuffering of the examination, to break to her that both he and his\r\ncolleague thought very seriously of the injury and its consequences,\r\nand deemed it very doubtful whether the poor little fellow could be\r\npulled through.\r\n\r\nMr. Egremont was again angry, declared that she had misunderstood, and\r\nmade the worst of it; that Dr. Brownlow was a conceited young ass; that\r\nhis friend played into his hands; with other amenities of the same\r\nkind, to which she listened with mingled irritation and pity for his\r\nunreasonableness, and even at the sympathy which he found in Annaple\'s\r\nhopeful nature.\r\n\r\nThe young mother never dreaded nor expected what she could not bear to\r\nthink possible, such as the death-warrant of that beautiful child,\r\nwhile Nuttie\'s nature always expected the worst, and indeed had read\r\nthe doom in the doctor\'s eyes and voice rather than in his words.  So\r\nAnnaple backed Mr. Egremont up when he made his daughter write to\r\ndesire Dr. Brownlow to call in the first advice in London; and among\r\nthem they made so sure that this would be effective that they actually\r\nraised Nuttie\'s hopes so as to buoy her through the feverish early\r\nhours of the night when the pain was aggravated, the terrors returned,\r\nthe boy was tormented by his duality with Fan, and the past miseries\r\nwere acted over again.  Even nurse and sister did not suffice, and\r\nMithter Button had to be fetched by Mark before he could feel quite\r\nsecure that he was Alwyn and not Fan.  Indeed, in these light-headed\r\nmoments, a better notion was gained of what he must have endured than\r\nin the day-time, when all seemed put aside or forgotten. After a time\r\nhe became capable of being soothed by hymns, though still asking why\r\nhis sister could not sing like that vision of his mother which had\r\ncomforted him in his previous miseries, and craving for her return.\r\nThen at last he fell quietly asleep, and Nuttie was left with a few\r\nsustaining words and a pressure from Mr. Dutton\'s hand.\r\n\r\nAlas! the new consultation could only ratify the first opinion.  The\r\ninjury need not have been necessarily fatal, though dangerous to any\r\nyoung child, and here it had been aggravated by previous ill-treatment,\r\nand by the doses of spirits that had been forced down, besides which,\r\nAlwyn was naturally delicate, and--though the doctors would not say so\r\nto father or sister--there were hereditary predispositions that gave\r\nhim the less chance of battling through.\r\n\r\nYet Mr. Egremont concluded his purchase of the pony, and insisted that\r\nAlwyn should be carried to the window to see it; and Alwyn\'s smile was\r\nalmost enough to break Nuttie\'s heart, but his head drooped on nurse\'s\r\nshoulder, he hardly lifted his heavy eyelids, and begged for \'by-by\'\r\nagain.  Even Annaple burst into tears at the sight, ran out of the room\r\nwith her sobs, and never augured recovery again, though still she\r\nstrove to cheer and while away the poor father\'s piteous hours by\r\nmaking the most of every sign that the child was happy and not\r\nsuffering much.\r\n\r\nThat he would be viewed as a \'pale placid martyr\' was his sister\'s\r\nchief comfort.  His replies as to the manner of the hurt, as well as\r\nhis light-headed wanderings, had made it more and more evident that the\r\nman Brag\'s brutality had been excited by his persisting in kneeling\r\ndown to say his prayers aloud--the only way he knew how to say them.\r\nIndeed there was a recurring anxiety night and morning to kneel, which\r\nhad to be reasoned away, even when he was too weak to make the attempt,\r\nand was only appeased by \'Sister\' kneeling by his side, holding his\r\nhands, and repeating the little prayers with him. It was of his own\r\naccord that he added: \'And forgive those people, and make them good.\'\r\nAnnaple burst into tears again and almost scolded when she heard of it.\r\n\'Oh dear! oh dear! now I know he won\'t get well!  I\'m glad Billy isn\'t\r\nso horribly good!  Nuttie, Nuttie, don\'t!  You know I don\'t mean it.\r\nOnly I just can\'t bear it.  He is the sweetest little fellow in the\r\nworld!  And oh! the cruelty of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Nuttie in her dreary calmness; \'he is too sweet and lovely\r\nand beautiful and good to be anywhere but safe with mother.\'\r\n\r\nFor it was more apparent that they could not keep him.  It did not last\r\nlong; there were a couple of piteous days of restless pain and\r\ndistress, and then came the more fatal lull and absence of suffering, a\r\ndrowsiness in which the little fellow sank gradually away, lying with a\r\nstrange calm beauty on his face, and smiling feebly when he now and\r\nthen lifted his eyes to rest them on sister or nurse.  His father could\r\nnot bear the sight.  It filled him more with angry compassion than with\r\nthe tender reverence and hushed awe with which Ursula watched her\r\ndarling slipping as it were from her hold.  So Mr. Egremont wandered\r\nwretchedly about the lower rooms, while Mark and Annaple tried their\r\nbest for him through the long summer evening, darkening into night.  By\r\nand by Alwyn lifted his hand, turned his head, opened his lips, and\r\nwhispered, \'Hark, sister, she is singing.\' The look of exceeding joy\r\nbeamed more and more over the pinched little face.  \'She\'s come again,\'\r\nhe said; and once more, \'Come to take Wyn to the dear Lord.\'  After\r\nthat there were very few more long breaths before little Alwyn\r\nEgremont\'s spirit was gone to that unseen world, and only the fair\r\nlittle frame left with that wondrous look of delighted recognition on\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE UMBRELLA MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Alwyn was laid to rest beside his mother in a beautiful summer\r\nnoontide.  His father was not in a state to attend the funeral, and was\r\nleft under the care of Annaple, his own choice among those who offered\r\nto stay and minister to him.  It was his own wish that his daughter\r\nshould be to the last with her little brother.  He had even said to her\r\nthat she had been a good sister, and his boy had been very fond of her,\r\nand he would not keep her away on any account.\r\n\r\nAnd, with a man\'s preference for a young and kindly woman, he chose\r\nAnnaple to be with him rather than Mr. Dutton, remembering likewise\r\nthat but for him the boy would have died in some workhouse, unknown and\r\nunclaimed, or among the wretches who had caused his death.  So Nuttie\r\nhad the comfort of Mr. Dutton\'s going down with her, as well as Mark,\r\nand poor broken-down nurse, but not a word referring to the confession\r\nof that happy evening had passed between them during the mournful\r\nfortnight which had since elapsed.\r\n\r\nMay Condamine and her husband had made all as fair and consoling as\r\nthey could.  There were white-robed children to bear the boy from the\r\nchurchyard gate, choristers sang hymns, the grave was lined with moss\r\nand daisies, and white roses decked the little coffin and the mound.\r\nThere was as much of welcome and even of triumph as befitted the\r\ninnocent child, whose death had in it the element of testimony to the\r\ntruth.  And Nuttie felt it, or would feel it by and by, when her spirit\r\nfelt less as if some precious thing had been torn up by the roots--to\r\nbe safe and waiting for her elsewhere, indeed, but that did not solace\r\nthe yearning longing for the merry loving child; nor the aching pity\r\nfor the crushed blighted creature whom she had watched suffering and\r\ndying.  It was far beyond her power as yet to acquiesce in her aunt\'s\r\nconsolation that it was happier for the child himself, than if he was\r\nto grow up to temptation from without, and with an unsound\r\nconstitution, with dangerous hereditary proclivities.  She could\r\nbelieve it in faith, nay, she had already experienced the difficulties\r\nher father had thrown in her way of dealing with him, she tried to be\r\nresigned, but the good sense of the Canoness was too much for her.\r\n\r\nIt was a day of more haste than suited the ideal of such a time, for\r\nMr. Egremont could not be left for a night; so there was only time for\r\na luncheon, with little jerks of talk, and then for an hour spent in\r\nshort private interviews.  Mrs. Egremont obtained from poor Nurse Poole\r\nall the details, and, moreover, her opinion of Mr. Mark\'s baby, in\r\nwhom, it having been born under her auspices, she took a special\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nNuttie meantime was pacing the shady walk with her dear old friend Miss\r\nNugent, feeling it strange that her heart did not leap up at the bare\r\npresence of one she loved so much, yet conscious of the soothing of her\r\nsympathy.  And Mary, watching her all through, had been struck with the\r\nincreased sweetness and nobleness her countenance had acquired during\r\nthese years of discipline.  More of her mother\'s expression had come\r\nthan could have been thought possible in features of such a different\r\nmould, formed for so much more strength and energy.  They had not met\r\nsince Nuttie had been summoned home to her mother\'s deathbed, and their\r\ntime was chiefly spent on reminiscences alike of the old sorrow and the\r\nnew; but, when the time for parting was nearly come, Mary said\r\naffectionately, \'And you, my dear?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I am all right,\' said Nuttie, and her eyes shone with a light Mary\r\ndid not at the moment understand; \'you need not be anxious for me\r\n_now_.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose that unhappy valet\'s death makes your task easier,\' said\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n\'I think it will,\' said Nuttie.  \'Poor man!  He was--I can\'t help\r\nsaying it--the evil genius of the house.  Dear mother knew it,\r\nstruggled against him, and broke down in the struggle.  It seems so\r\nstrange that what she could not do has been done in such a manner, and\r\nat such a price!  I wonder whether she knew it when she welcomed her\r\nboy!\'\r\n\r\n\'Her influence will aid you still,\' said Mary, \'and you have Mr. Dutton\r\nto help you too.  I was so glad to find he was so near you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Mr. Dutton!\' exclaimed Ursula, in a strange tone that sent a\r\nthrill through Mary, though she knew not why; but at that moment they\r\nwere interrupted, very inopportunely, by Mr. Bulfinch, who could not go\r\naway without asking Miss Egremont whether she thought her father could\r\nsee him on business if he came up to town the next day.  She thought\r\nthat such an interview would rouse her father and do him good, advising\r\nhim to call on the chance.\r\n\r\nMark\'s tete-a-tete had been with his sister May, to whom he had much to\r\ntell of his wife and her gallant patience and energy, and how curious\r\nit was that now the incubus that had weighed on his uncle\'s household\r\nwas removed, the prejudice had melted away, and he had grown so fond of\r\nher that, next to Ursula, she was his best comforter.\r\n\r\n\'I hope that will lead to more,\' said May.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see how,\' said Mark.  The more we rely only on a blessing on\r\nour own exertions the better.\'\r\n\r\n\'Even when Annaple works within an inch of her life?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now that she is on a right tack about the baby, that will be easier.\r\nYes, May, I do feel sometimes that I have brought her down to drudgery\r\nand narrowness and want of variety such as was never meant for her, but\r\nshe will never let me think so.  She says that it is living in\r\nrealities, and that it makes her happier than toiling after society, or\r\nrather after the world, and I do believe it is true!  I\'m sure it is\r\nwith me.\'\r\n\r\n\'But such work as yours, Mark.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, May; I enjoy it.  I did not when I was in the Greenleaf\r\nfirm, with an undeveloped sense that Goodenough was not to be trusted,\r\nand we were drifting to the bad, yet too green to understand or hinder\r\nit; but this I thoroughly like.  What does one want but honest\r\neffective work, with some power of dealing with and helping those good\r\nfellows, the hands, to see the right and help themselves?\'\r\n\r\nMay sighed.  \'And yet, now that poor child is gone, I feel all the more\r\nhow hard it is that you should be put out of the rights of your name.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never had any rights.  It was the bane of my life to be supposed to\r\nhave them.  Nothing but this could have made a man of me.\'\r\n\r\n\'And don\'t you have regrets for your boy?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think I have--provided we can give him an education--such as I\r\nfailed to make proper use of, or Annaple might be luxuriating at Pera\r\nat this moment.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well!\' said May, pausing as she looked up the vista of trees at the\r\ngreat house; \'I can\'t bear it to go out of the old name.\'\r\n\r\n\'Names may be taken!\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean that there\'s any chance of--Oh! not that horrid Mr.\r\nFane?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' as a trim black figure appeared walking down the open space.\r\n\'That man!\'\r\n\r\n\'I am not authorised to tell any one so, May.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I understand.  The wretch, he is taking stock of the place\r\nalready!\'\r\n\r\n\'For shame.  May, no one has deserved so well of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t care, he got you into that horrid concern.\'\r\n\r\n\'And got me out of it, and found my work for me.  I tell you, May, it\r\nis the best thing that could possibly happen to your parish, or the\r\nestate, or my poor uncle either!  And you will soon come to a better\r\nmind.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never, while he is to get into your place!  Turn back before he comes\r\nwithin hailing distance.\'\r\n\r\nBefore Mark could do anything towards bringing his sister to a better\r\nmind he was seized on by his stepmother to propound a scheme she had\r\nhatched, namely that, as a mutual benefit, Nurse Poole should be\r\nallowed the consolation of bringing her chief comforter, his little\r\ndaughter, down with her on the visit Mrs. Egremont had invited her to\r\npay at Redcastle.  He was very grateful, though doubtful whether\r\nAnnaple would accept the offer, for she was missing her children\'s\r\ncompany, though they were only at Springfield House, and she had been\r\nwith them part of every day.  And, sad as this month had been, it had\r\nbeen such a rest from sheer physical toil that she had gained almost as\r\nmuch by it as the little one.\r\n\r\nThere was a general assembly and coffee-drinking in the verandah,--Mr.\r\nCondamine, Blanche, and her two young sisters were all there,--and May\r\nhad to be duly civil to Mr. Dutton, though he came back with some\r\nwater-lilies that he had fished out of the lake for Nuttie, and she\r\nthought it taking possession.  Then the Londoners set forth for the\r\nstation, and there Mark, having perhaps had a hint from his wife, saw\r\nNuttie and Mr. Dutton safely bestowed by Broadbent in an empty\r\ncarriage, and then discovered a desire to smoke, and left them to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThey had not been alone together for more than a second since the\r\nevening of Alwyn\'s return, and there was a great shyness between them,\r\nwhich lasted till the first station was past without any irruption of\r\nnewcomers.  Nothing had been said but a few comments on the\r\narrangements and the attendants, but probably both were trying to begin\r\nto speak, and at last it was Ursula who crossed over so that her face\r\ncould not be seen, and said in an odd tone--\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Dutton--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' and he turned, instantly on the alert.\r\n\r\n\'Did you mean it--what I thought you meant that evening?\'\r\n\r\n\'Can you doubt it?\' he said earnestly.  \'But even then I was surprised\r\ninto the avowal, and I would have held it back if possible, if I had\r\nguessed what was going to happen.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah! but then I should not have had that drop of comfort through it\r\nall,\' and she laid hold of his hand, which returned the pressure\r\nstrongly, but he sedulously guarded both words and tone as he said:\r\n\r\n\'Listen, Ursula, before you speak again.  How dear you must always be\r\nto me, I cannot tell you, but when I then spoke, it was with the sense\r\nthat on every account, I should meet with strong opposition from your\r\nfather and family.  And now your position is altered, so that the\r\nunsuitability is doubled.  I am not a young man, remember, and my\r\nthoughts must be for you above all, I want you to consider whether, in\r\nthe present state of affairs, you would not do better to look on what\r\nthen passed as unsaid, or only as the ebullition of gratitude towards\r\nyour old friend.  Let me go abroad, and give you full opportunity\r\nfor--for some fresh beginning likely to be fitter for you--\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Dutton, how can you say such horrid things?  As if a dukedom would\r\nmake any difference.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' he said, turning towards her.  \'If it is only the old-friend\r\nfeeling, then it is better dropped, but if your heart is in it, child,\r\nthen we go on, come what may.  It is due to you.\'\r\n\r\nShe raised her face towards him now, and he gave a grave kiss to her\r\nforehead.  She drew a long breath, and said after a little pause, \'And\r\nnow I have something to say.  One does think of such things even in\r\nthese sad times, and you can help me.  I am so glad it is you, because\r\nI know you will, and be rejoiced to do so.  You know when Mark found us\r\nout first, dear mother and I always felt that it was a great pity he\r\nshould not have the estate he had been brought up to expect.  I believe\r\ndear mother thought it would have been the right thing for me to marry\r\nhim, but I always did mean to give it back to him, even when I didn\'t\r\nlike him.  Well, then, you know it all seemed settled otherwise, but\r\nnow, it is so lucky you spoke to me while that dear little fellow was\r\nwith us, because now you will help me to persuade my father that it is\r\nthe only satisfactory thing to do to let it go in the male line to Mark\r\nand his Willy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see!  I see!\' said Mr. Dutton eagerly.  \'It would be an infinite\r\nrelief if it could be carried out.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe my father would like it,\' said Nuttie.  \'He cares for the\r\nname; and now no one prevents it; he is fond of Mark, and still more of\r\nAnnaple!  And you!  Oh, Mr. Dutton, if he will only take it in the\r\nright way, I think you will make me able to do what it grieved dear\r\nmother never to have brought about for my poor father.\'\r\n\r\n\'My whole self is yours to aid you,\' he said.  \'You know of course that\r\nI could not ask you to detach yourself from one to whom you are so\r\nnecessary.  If he will permit us, we will watch over him together as\r\ndoing her work.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' was all Nuttie\'s lips could utter, though her hand said\r\nmuch more.\r\n\r\nAnd before they reached London they had arranged something of a plan of\r\naction for propitiating Mr. Egremont, and bringing the future prospects\r\nto be available so as to save Annaple from being worked to death in the\r\nmeantime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nANNAPLE\'S AMBITION FALLEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Well, how did you get on, Annaple?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! very well, poor old man, on the whole, though it made one pity him\r\ndoubly that he chose to make as if he forgot everything, and you were\r\nall gone on a picnic, taking me out for a long drive in the\r\nafternoon--where we were least likely to meet any one--that I will say\r\nfor him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Forgetting is not the best for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'As if he could forget!  But he was very nice and friendly, and put on\r\nhis best, most courteous self.  I think he looks on me rather as a\r\nprotector from the solemn Mr. Edsall.\'\r\n\r\n\'Surely Edsall treats him well.  He was excellently recommended.  You\r\nknow I saw his master\'s daughter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! only _too_ well.  He takes the management of him as if he were\r\nthree years old, or a lunatic.  He simply _will_ not be offended any\r\nmore than if he had to do with a baby.\'\r\n\r\n\'What should offend him?\'\r\n\r\n\'That Mr. Egremont greatly resents being allowed nothing but by what\r\nEdsall calls medical sanction.  He is too blind, you know, to venture\r\nto pour out anything for himself, and besides, Edsall has all the drugs\r\nunder lock and key, and is coolness itself about any amount of\r\nobjurgations, such as I fancy go on sometimes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think he will stand it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Who?  Your uncle?  Yes, I think he will.  This man really makes him\r\nmore comfortable than poor Gregorio did.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; Nuttie said she was sure that there was neglect, if not bullying\r\nlatterly.  But he must miss Gregorio terribly.  They had been together\r\nfor at least five-and-twenty or thirty years, and had plenty of gossip\r\ntogether.\'\r\n\r\n\'Whereas the present paternal despotism and appalling dignity and\r\ngravity will keep him more dependent on his right congeners.\'\r\n\r\n\'If they are of the right sort, that\'s all.\'\r\n\r\n\'He has been making me read him a whole heap of letters; indeed, as you\r\nknow, I have been doing that all along, when he could not get Nuttie.\r\nThere were some from Mr. Bulfinch.  Do you know that bailiff of his\r\nmust be next door to a swindler?\'\r\n\r\n\'Bulfinch is coming up to see him to-morrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'And, Mark, do you know, he has been putting out feelers as if to\r\ndiscover whether we would do--what he asked us to do five years ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'Would you?\'\r\n\r\n\'If it were not for the children, and--and sometimes the extreme pinch,\r\nI should say it was more like _life_ to work yourself up as a City\r\nman,\' said Annaple.  \'If you were the Squire, with all his\r\nopportunities, it would be a different thing, but there\'s no outlet\r\nthere, and I have often admired the wisdom of the Apocryphal saying,\r\n"Make not thyself an underling to a foolish man."\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it is lucky you think so, Nannie, for though Dutton is certainly\r\nnot a foolish man, he will not want an underling.  And what do you say\r\nto my mother\'s proposal of having poor Poole to stay at Redcastle, and\r\nborrowing baby to comfort her till she goes out again.\r\n\r\n\'I hate it,\' said Annaple energetically.  \'It is very horrid, but it is\r\nawfully good of the Canoness; and I suppose we shall have to let it\r\ncome to pass, and miss all that most charming time of babyhood which is\r\ncoming.  But most likely it will quite set the little woman up, and be\r\na real kindness to poor Poole.\'\r\n\r\n\'If we could only keep her for good.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, and then our children would not be half so much our own.  I do\r\nwant to be away with them in our own quarters.  I wonder when Nuttie\r\ncan spare us, but I should like to see her through the great crisis\r\nwith her father.\'\r\n\r\nThat crisis was to involve more than Annaple in the least expected.\r\nNuttie found that the momentous confession could not possibly take\r\nplace before the interview with Mr. Bulfinch, at which her presence was\r\nneeded to help her father with his papers.  The principal concern was\r\nto show the full enormity of the bailiff, and decide upon the steps to\r\nbe taken, the solicitor being anxious for a prosecution, while a\r\ncertain tenderness for poor Gregorio\'s memory, or perhaps for the\r\nexposure of his own carelessness, made Mr. Egremont reluctant. There\r\nwas also a proposal, brought forward with much diffidence from Mr.\r\nCondamine\'s mother, to rent Bridgefield House, but on this, as well as\r\nrespecting a successor to the bailiff, Mr. Egremont was to give his\r\nanswer the next day, when Mr. Bulfinch would call again.\r\n\r\nNuttie was thankful for the business that had filled up the hour after\r\nluncheon, when Alwyn used to play in the drawing-room and delight his\r\nfather; but she was feeling desperate to have the crisis over, and\r\nresolved to speak when she went out driving with him.  It was he,\r\nhowever, who began.  \'I sounded Mark\'s wife yesterday, Ursula.  She is\r\na nice little thing enough, and a good wife in her way.\'\r\n\r\n\'A very good wife.\'\r\n\r\n\'Except when she persuaded him to turn up his nose at the agency. D\'ye\r\nthink he would take it now, since he has tasted the sweets of his\r\numbrella business?\' then, as Nuttie paused, taken by surprise; \'Five\r\nhundred a year and the Home Farm would be better than, what is it, a\r\nhundred and fifty and a floor over a warehouse!  I don\'t like to see\r\nold Will\'s son wearing himself out there, and the lad is a good honest\r\nlad, with business habits, who would do justice to you after I am gone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Father,\' said Nuttie, trembling with the effort, \'I want you to do\r\nsomething better than that.  I want you to let Mark take the agency\r\nwith a view to himself--not me.  Let him be as he would have been if he\r\nhad never hunted us up at Micklethwayte, and put me in his place.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eh!\' said Mr. Egremont.  \'It is not entailed--worse luck; if it had\r\nbeen, I should not have been bound to dance attendance at the heels of\r\nsuch an old sinner as the General.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, but it ought to go to the heir male, and keep in the old name.\r\nThink--there have been Egremonts at Bridgefield for four hundred years!\'\r\n\r\n\'Very pretty talk, but how will it be with you, Miss.  We shall have\r\nFane, and I don\'t know how many more, coming after the scent of\r\nBridgefield now,\' he said with a heavy sigh, ending with a bitter \'Hang\r\nthem all!\'\r\n\r\n\'And welcome,\' said Nuttie, answering the thought rather than the\r\nwords.  \'Father, I wanted to tell you--\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t mean that any one has been after you at such a time as\r\nthis!\' he cried.\r\n\r\n\'It was before--I mean it was the evening when we were all so glad,\r\nbefore we began to be afraid.\'\r\n\r\n\'The umbrella man!  By Jove!\'\r\n\r\n\'And now,\' went on Nuttie, in spite of the explosion, \'he would hardly\r\nhave ventured to go on with it but for this--I mean,\' as her father\r\ngave a little laugh of his unpleasant sort, \'he said it would be the\r\ngreatest possible relief, and make it all right for the property to go\r\nto the heir male.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hein!  You think so, do you?  See how it will be when I come to talk\r\nto him!  A shrewd fellow like that who got out of the Micklethwayte\r\nconcern just in time.  Catch him giving up a place like that, though he\r\nmay humbug you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you will see him, father?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you turn him in on me, I can\'t help it.  Bless me! umbrellas\r\neverywhere!  And here you mean to turn me over to the mercies of that\r\nsolemn idiot, Edsall.  I should have been better off with poor\r\nGregorio.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, father; Mr. Dutton would not take me from you.  We would both try\r\nall we could to make you comfortable.\'\r\n\r\n\'Convert the old reprobate?  Is that his dodge?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t, father,\' for the sneering tone returned.\r\n\r\n\'Come now,\' he added in a much more fatherly manner, for her voice had\r\nstruck him.  \'You don\'t mean that a well-looking girl like you, who\r\ncould have her pick of all the swells in town, can really be smitten\r\nwith a priggish old retired umbrella-monger like that.  Why, he might\r\nbe your father.\'\r\n\r\n\'He has been getting younger ever since I knew him,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'Well.  He plays as good a game of whist as any man in England,\'\r\nmuttered Mr. Egremont, leaving his daughter in actual doubt whether he\r\nmeant this as a recommendation, or as expressing a distrust of him, as\r\none likely to play his cards to the best advantage.  She had to remain\r\nin doubt, for they overtook Clarence Fane, who came and spoke to them\r\nin a very friendly and solicitous manner, and showed himself willing to\r\naccept a lift in the carriage.  Mr. Egremont, willing to escape from\r\nperplexities as well as to endeavour to drive away if possible the\r\noppression of his grief, invited him in, and he had some gossip to\r\nimpart, which at first seemed to amuse the hearer after this time of\r\nseclusion, but the sick and sore heart soon wearied of it, and long\r\nbefore the drive was over, Mr. Egremont was as much bored as his\r\ndaughter had been from the first.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Fane got out, he paused a moment to hold Ursula\'s hand in a\r\ntender manner, while he told her that he had not ventured to intrude\r\n(he had left a card of inquiry every day), but that if ever he could be\r\nof the least use in amusing Mr. Egremont, he was at her service, and\r\nwould give up any engagement.\r\n\r\n\'Hein! my fine fellow!  No doubt you would!\' said Mr. Egremont, when\r\nhis daughter had uttered her cold thanks, and they had driven on.  \'I\r\nsee your little game, but it is soon to begin it.  We may as well let\r\nthem know that she is booked before the running begins.\'\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable intimation of his acceptance of her engagement, but\r\nUrsula was contented to take it as such, and be thankful.\r\n\r\nMr. Dutton had his interview as soon as Mr. Egremont had rested after\r\nhis drive, and the result was satisfactory.\r\n\r\nNo doubt much was due to the Egremont indolence and want of energy,\r\nwhich always preferred to let things take their course.  And now that\r\nGregorio was no longer present to amuse, and take all trouble off his\r\nhands, Mr. Egremont could hardly have borne to part with his daughter;\r\nand, despite of umbrellas and religion, was not sorry to have a\r\nperfectly trustworthy son-in-law in the house, able to play at cards\r\nwith him, manage his household, and obviate all trouble about suitors\r\nfor the heiress.  Moreover, his better feelings were stirred by\r\ngratitude on his poor little son\'s account, and he knew very well that\r\na more brilliant match for his daughter would not have secured for his\r\nold age the care and attention he could rely upon here.  He was obliged\r\nlikewise to believe in the disinterestedness, which disclaimed all\r\ndesire for the estate, as involving cares and duties for which there\r\nhad been no training; and he was actually glad to keep the property in\r\nthe direct line.  The old liking for Mark, and sense of the hardship of\r\nhis exclusion, revived, strengthened now by regard for Annaple;\r\ntogether with the present relief from care obtained by making him\r\nmanager of the estate.\r\n\r\nWhen once brought to a point, Mr. Egremont was always sudden and\r\nimpetuous, chiefly for the sake of having it over and being unmolested\r\nand at rest again.  So that very evening, while Nuttie only ventured on\r\nsharing with Annaple the glad tidings that Mr. Dutton was accepted, and\r\nin his marvellous goodness, undertook to make his home with her father.\r\nMark was almost stunned by the news, confirmed to him by Mr. Dutton as\r\nwell as his uncle, that he was to be acknowledged as heir of\r\nBridgefield Egremont, and in the meantime manage the estate with an\r\nincome suitable to an oldest son.\r\n\r\nPresently he came upstairs by himself, and beckoned to Nuttie, rather\r\nto the alarm of his wife.\r\n\r\n\'Ursula,\' he said, and took both her hands, \'I cannot have you do this\r\nfor me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t you, Mark?  You can\'t prevent it, you see.  And don\'t you know\r\nit is the beginning of all my happiness?\'\r\n\r\n\'But indeed, I cannot feel it right.  It is a strained sense of\r\njustice.  Come and tell her so, Nannie.\'\r\n\r\n\'What?\' said Annaple coming forward.\r\n\r\nThey both paused a moment, then Nuttie said, \'Only that the estate\r\nought to go in the male line.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, is that all?\' said Annaple, \'I was afraid Mr. Egremont had a fit!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  Don\'t you see what it means,\' said Mark.  \'They want it to be as\r\nif there were an entail--to begin treating me as an eldest son at once.\r\nIt is Ursula\'s doing, putting herself out of the succession.\'\r\n\r\n\'I always hated being an heiress,\' said Nuttie.\r\n\r\n\'It would be more dreadful than ever now.  Annaple, do be sensible!\r\nDon\'t you see it is the only right thing to do?\'\r\n\r\n\'Billy!\' was the one word Annaple said.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Billy and Jenny and all,\' said Nuttie, \'before you\'ve all died of\r\nyour horrid place--Oh! you haven\'t heard that part of it.  Of course\r\nMark will have to go down to Bridgefield and look after the place, and\r\nlive like a gentleman.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eight hundred a year,\' murmured Mark, \'and the house at the Home Farm.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! dear,\' gasped Annaple, \'I wanted you to be Lord Mayor, and now\r\nyou\'ll only be a stupid old country squire.  No, no, Nuttie,\r\nit\'s--it\'s--it\'s the sort of thing that one only laughs at because\r\notherwise one would have to do the other thing!\'\r\n\r\nAnd she gripped Nuttie tight round the waist, and laid her head on her\r\nshoulder, shaking with a few little sobs, which might be one thing or\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\'It will save her youth, perhaps her life,\' whispered Mark, lifting\r\nNuttie\'s hand to his lips for a moment, and then vanishing, while\r\nAnnaple recovered enough to say, \'I\'m tougher than that, sir.  But\r\nlittle Jenny!  Oh, Nuttie, I believe it has come in time.  I\'ve known\r\nall along that one straw more might break the camel\'s back.  We\'ve been\r\nvery happy, but I am glad it is over before Mark got worn down before\r\nhis time.  Grinding is very wholesome, but one may have too much; and I\r\nhaven\'t Mark\'s scruples, Nuttie dear, for I do think the place is more\r\nin his line than yours or Mr. Dutton\'s.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Ursula, \'you see he was always happy there, and I never\r\nwas.\'\r\n\r\nThe next thing was for Mr. Dutton and Ursula to keep Mr. Egremont up to\r\nthe point of making his long deferred will; nor did they find this so\r\ndifficult as they expected, for having once made up his mind, he wished\r\nto have the matter concluded, and he gave his instructions to Bulfinch\r\nthe next day.  Of course Mark had to give full notice to his employers;\r\nbut the allowance was to begin at once, so that Annaple only went back\r\nto the warehouse to pack up, since she was to occupy No. 5, while Mr.\r\nEgremont and his daughter were going under Mr. Dutton\'s escort to the\r\nbaths in Dauphine, an entirely new resort, free from the associations\r\nhe dreaded, for he could not yet bear the sight of little Willy--the\r\nrival \'boy of Egremont.\'  But the will was safely signed before he\r\nwent, to the great relief of Nuttie, who, according to the experience\r\nof fiction, could hardly believe his life safe till what she called\r\njustice had been done.\r\n\r\nAfter all Mr. Egremont became so dependent on Mr. Dutton, during this\r\njourney, that he did not like the separation at its close, and pressed\r\non the marriage even sooner than either of the lovers felt quite\r\nreverent towards the recent sorrow.  He insisted on Bulfinch having the\r\nsettlements ready for them on their return, and only let them wait long\r\nenough to keep their residence, before there was a very quiet wedding\r\nin their parish church, with the cousins for bridesmaids.  Then Mark\r\nand Annaple took care of Mr. Egremont for the fortnight while Mr.\r\nDutton showed his wife his old haunts in France, returning to\r\nSpringfield House, where there was plenty of room for Mr. Egremont to\r\nmake his home with them.\r\n\r\nSaid Annaple to Miss Nugent, \'I never saw Nuttie so youthful and\r\nbright.  She is more like a girl than I ever saw her since the first.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Mary, \'she has some one to rest on now.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Egremont lived between three and four years, more contented and\r\npeaceful than he had ever been, though frequently suffering, and\r\nsometimes giving way to temper and impatience.  But Mr. Dutton\r\nunderstood how to manage on these occasions, and without giving up his\r\nown extensive usefulness, could give him such care, attention, and\r\namusement as beguiled his discomforts, and made his daughter\'s task an\r\neasier one.\r\n\r\nHow far the sluggish enfeebled nature was capable of a touch of better\r\nthings, or whether his low spirits were repentance, no one could judge.\r\nAt any rate sneers had ended, and when he was laid beside his wife and\r\nboy at Bridgefield, Ursula stood by the grave with a far more tender\r\nand hopeful feeling than she could have thought possible when he had\r\nrent her away from her old home. She looked up at her husband and said,\r\n\'Is not her work done?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Nuttie\'s Father, by Charlotte M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
