Introducing to the reader the chief personages of this\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that famous period of history, when the seventeenth century (after\r\na deal of quarrelling, king-killing, reforming, republicanising,\r\nrestoring, re-restoring, play-writing, sermon-writing,\r\nOliver-Cromwellising, Stuartising, and Orangising, to be sure) had sunk\r\ninto its grave, giving place to the lusty eighteenth; when Mr. Isaac\r\nNewton was a tutor of Trinity, and Mr. Joseph Addison Commissioner of\r\nAppeals; when the presiding genius that watched over the destinies of\r\nthe French nation had played out all the best cards in his hand, and his\r\nadversaries began to pour in their trumps; when there were two kings in\r\nSpain employed perpetually in running away from one another; when there\r\nwas a queen in England, with such rogues for Ministers as have never\r\nbeen seen, no, not in our own day; and a General, of whom it may be\r\nseverely argued, whether he was the meanest miser or the greatest hero\r\nin the world; when Mrs. Masham had not yet put Madam Marlborough's nose\r\nout of joint; when people had their ears cut off for writing very\r\nmeek political pamphlets; and very large full-bottomed wigs were just\r\nbeginning to be worn with powder; and the face of Louis the Great, as\r\nhis was handed in to him behind the bed-curtains, was, when issuing\r\nthence, observed to look longer, older, and more dismal daily....\r\n\r\nAbout the year One thousand seven hundred and five, that is, in the\r\nglorious reign of Queen Anne, there existed certain characters, and\r\nbefell a series of adventures, which, since they are strictly in\r\naccordance with the present fashionable style and taste; since they have\r\nbeen already partly described in the \xe2\x80\x9cNewgate Calendar;\xe2\x80\x9d since they are\r\n(as shall be seen anon) agreeably low, delightfully disgusting, and at\r\nthe same time eminently pleasing and pathetic, may properly be set down\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAnd though it may be said, with some considerable show of reason, that\r\nagreeably low and delightfully disgusting characters have already been\r\ntreated, both copiously and ably, by some eminent writers of the present\r\n(and, indeed, of future) ages; though to tread in the footsteps of\r\nthe immortal FAGIN requires a genius of inordinate stride, and to go\r\na-robbing after the late though deathless TURPIN, the renowned\r\nJACK SHEPPARD, or the embryo DUVAL, may be impossible, and not an\r\ninfringement, but a wasteful indication of ill-will towards the eighth\r\ncommandment; though it may, on the one hand, be asserted that only vain\r\ncoxcombs would dare to write on subjects already described by men really\r\nand deservedly eminent; on the other hand, that these subjects have been\r\ndescribed so fully, that nothing more can be said about them; on the\r\nthird hand (allowing, for the sake of argument, three hands to one\r\nfigure of speech), that the public has heard so much of them, as to\r\nbe quite tired of rogues, thieves, cutthroats, and Newgate\r\naltogether;--though all these objections may be urged, and each is\r\nexcellent, yet we intend to take a few more pages from the \xe2\x80\x9cOld Bailey\r\nCalendar,\xe2\x80\x9d to bless the public with one more draught from the Stone\r\nJug:[*]--yet awhile to listen, hurdle-mounted, and riding down the\r\nOxford Road, to the bland conversation of Jack Ketch, and to hang with\r\nhim round the neck of his patient, at the end of our and his history.\r\nWe give the reader fair notice, that we shall tickle him with a few such\r\nscenes of villainy, throat-cutting, and bodily suffering in general, as\r\nare not to be found, no, not in--; never mind comparisons, for such are\r\nodious.\r\n\r\n     * This, as your Ladyship is aware, is the polite name for\r\n     Her Majesty's Prison of Newgate.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1705, then, whether it was that the Queen of England did\r\nfeel seriously alarmed at the notion that a French prince should occupy\r\nthe Spanish throne; or whether she was tenderly attached to the Emperor\r\nof Germany; or whether she was obliged to fight out the quarrel of\r\nWilliam of Orange, who made us pay and fight for his Dutch provinces;\r\nor whether poor old Louis Quatorze did really frighten her; or whether\r\nSarah Jennings and her husband wanted to make a fight, knowing how much\r\nthey should gain by it;--whatever the reason was, it was evident that\r\nthe war was to continue, and there was almost as much soldiering\r\nand recruiting, parading, pike and gun-exercising, flag-flying,\r\ndrum-beating, powder-blazing, and military enthusiasm, as we can all\r\nremember in the year 1801, what time the Corsican upstart menaced our\r\nshores. A recruiting-party and captain of Cutts's regiment (which had\r\nbeen so mangled at Blenheim the year before) were now in Warwickshire;\r\nand having their depot at Warwick, the captain and his attendant, the\r\ncorporal, were used to travel through the country, seeking for heroes to\r\nfill up the gaps in Cutts's corps,--and for adventures to pass away the\r\nweary time of a country life.\r\n\r\nOur Captain Plume and Sergeant Kite (it was at this time, by the way,\r\nthat those famous recruiting-officers were playing their pranks in\r\nShrewsbury) were occupied very much in the same manner with Farquhar's\r\nheroes. They roamed from Warwick to Stratford, and from Stratford to\r\nBirmingham, persuading the swains of Warwickshire to leave the plough\r\nfor the Pike, and despatching, from time to time, small detachments\r\nof recruits to extend Marlborough's lines, and to act as food for the\r\nhungry cannon at Ramillies and Malplaquet.\r\n\r\nOf those two gentlemen who are about to act a very important part in our\r\nhistory, one only was probably a native of Britain,--we say probably,\r\nbecause the individual in question was himself quite uncertain, and, it\r\nmust be added, entirely indifferent about his birthplace; but speaking\r\nthe English language, and having been during the course of his life\r\npretty generally engaged in the British service, he had a tolerably\r\nfair claim to the majestic title of Briton. His name was Peter Brock,\r\notherwise Corporal Brock, of Lord Cutts's regiment of dragoons; he was\r\nof age about fifty-seven (even that point has never been ascertained);\r\nin height about five feet six inches; in weight, nearly thirteen stone;\r\nwith a chest that the celebrated Leitch himself might envy; an arm\r\nthat was like an opera-dancer's leg; a stomach so elastic that it would\r\naccommodate itself to any given or stolen quantity of food; a great\r\naptitude for strong liquors; a considerable skill in singing chansons de\r\ntable of not the most delicate kind; he was a lover of jokes, of which\r\nhe made many, and passably bad; when pleased, simply coarse, boisterous,\r\nand jovial; when angry, a perfect demon: bullying, cursing, storming,\r\nfighting, as is sometimes the wont with gentlemen of his cloth and\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock was strictly, what the Marquis of Rodil styled himself in a\r\nproclamation to his soldiers after running away, a hijo de la guerra--a\r\nchild of war. Not seven cities, but one or two regiments, might contend\r\nfor the honour of giving him birth; for his mother, whose name he took,\r\nhad acted as camp-follower to a Royalist regiment; had then obeyed the\r\nParliamentarians; died in Scotland when Monk was commanding in that\r\ncountry; and the first appearance of Mr. Brock in a public capacity\r\ndisplayed him as a fifer in the General's own regiment of Coldstreamers,\r\nwhen they marched from Scotland to London, and from a republic at once\r\ninto a monarchy. Since that period, Brock had been always with the army,\r\nhe had had, too, some promotion, for he spake of having a command at the\r\nbattle of the Boyne; though probably (as he never mentioned the fact)\r\nupon the losing side. The very year before this narrative commences,\r\nhe had been one of Mordaunt's forlorn hope at Schellenberg, for which\r\nservice he was promised a pair of colours; he lost them, however, and\r\nwas almost shot (but fate did not ordain that his career should close\r\nin that way) for drunkenness and insubordination immediately after the\r\nbattle; but having in some measure reinstated himself by a display\r\nof much gallantry at Blenheim, it was found advisable to send him to\r\nEngland for the purposes of recruiting, and remove him altogether from\r\nthe regiment where his gallantry only rendered the example of his riot\r\nmore dangerous.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock's commander was a slim young gentleman of twenty-six, about\r\nwhom there was likewise a history, if one would take the trouble to\r\ninquire. He was a Bavarian by birth (his mother being an English lady),\r\nand enjoyed along with a dozen other brothers the title of count: eleven\r\nof these, of course, were penniless; one or two were priests, one a\r\nmonk, six or seven in various military services, and the elder at home\r\nat Schloss Galgenstein breeding horses, hunting wild boars, swindling\r\ntenants, living in a great house with small means; obliged to be sordid\r\nat home all the year, to be splendid for a month at the capital, as\r\nis the way with many other noblemen. Our young count, Count Gustavus\r\nAdolphus Maximilian von Galgenstein, had been in the service of the\r\nFrench as page to a nobleman; then of His Majesty's gardes du corps;\r\nthen a lieutenant and captain in the Bavarian service; and when, after\r\nthe battle of Blenheim, two regiments of Germans came over to the\r\nwinning side, Gustavus Adolphus Maximilian found himself among them; and\r\nat the epoch when this story commences, had enjoyed English pay for a\r\nyear or more. It is unnecessary to say how he exchanged into his present\r\nregiment; how it appeared that, before her marriage, handsome John\r\nChurchill had known the young gentleman's mother, when they were both\r\npenniless hangers-on at Charles the Second's court;--it is, we say,\r\nquite useless to repeat all the scandal of which we are perfectly\r\nmasters, and to trace step by step the events of his history. Here,\r\nhowever, was Gustavus Adolphus, in a small inn, in a small village of\r\nWarwickshire, on an autumn evening in the year 1705; and at the very\r\nmoment when this history begins, he and Mr. Brock, his corporal and\r\nfriend, were seated at a round table before the kitchen-fire while a\r\nsmall groom of the establishment was leading up and down on the\r\nvillage green, before the inn door, two black, glossy, long-tailed,\r\nbarrel-bellied, thick-flanked, arch-necked, Roman-nosed Flanders horses,\r\nwhich were the property of the two gentlemen now taking their ease at\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBugle Inn.\xe2\x80\x9d The two gentlemen were seated at their ease at the inn\r\ntable, drinking mountain-wine; and if the reader fancies from the sketch\r\nwhich we have given of their lives, or from his own blindness and belief\r\nin the perfectibility of human nature, that the sun of that autumn\r\nevening shone upon any two men in county or city, at desk or harvest, at\r\nCourt or at Newgate, drunk or sober, who were greater rascals than\r\nCount Gustavus Galgenstein and Corporal Peter Brock, he is egregiously\r\nmistaken, and his knowledge of human nature is not worth a fig. If they\r\nhad not been two prominent scoundrels, what earthly business should we\r\nhave in detailing their histories? What would the public care for\r\nthem? Who would meddle with dull virtue, humdrum sentiment, or stupid\r\ninnocence, when vice, agreeable vice, is the only thing which the\r\nreaders of romances care to hear?\r\n\r\nThe little horse-boy, who was leading the two black Flanders horses up\r\nand down the green, might have put them in the stable for any good that\r\nthe horses got by the gentle exercise which they were now taking in the\r\ncool evening air, as their owners had not ridden very far or very hard,\r\nand there was not a hair turned of their sleek shining coats; but the\r\nlad had been especially ordered so to walk the horses about until he\r\nreceived further commands from the gentlemen reposing in the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n kitchen; and the idlers of the village seemed so pleased with the\r\nbeasts, and their smart saddles and shining bridles, that it would have\r\nbeen a pity to deprive them of the pleasure of contemplating such an\r\ninnocent spectacle. Over the Count's horse was thrown a fine red cloth,\r\nrichly embroidered in yellow worsted, a very large count's coronet and a\r\ncipher at the four corners of the covering; and under this might be\r\nseen a pair of gorgeous silver stirrups, and above it, a couple of\r\nsilver-mounted pistols reposing in bearskin holsters; the bit was silver\r\ntoo, and the horse's head was decorated with many smart ribbons. Of the\r\nCorporal's steed, suffice it to say, that the ornaments were in brass,\r\nas bright, though not perhaps so valuable, as those which decorated the\r\nCaptain's animal. The boys, who had been at play on the green, first\r\npaused and entered into conversation with the horse-boy; then the\r\nvillage matrons followed; and afterwards, sauntering by ones and twos,\r\ncame the village maidens, who love soldiers as flies love treacle;\r\npresently the males began to arrive, and lo! the parson of the parish,\r\ntaking his evening walk with Mrs. Dobbs, and the four children his\r\noffspring, at length joined himself to his flock.\r\n\r\nTo this audience the little ostler explained that the animals belonged\r\nto two gentlemen now reposing at the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle:\xe2\x80\x9d one young with gold\r\nhair, the other old with grizzled locks; both in red coats; both in\r\njack-boots; putting the house into a bustle, and calling for the best.\r\nHe then discoursed to some of his own companions regarding the merits of\r\nthe horses; and the parson, a learned man, explained to the villagers,\r\nthat one of the travellers must be a count, or at least had a count's\r\nhorsecloth; pronounced that the stirrups were of real silver, and\r\nchecked the impetuosity of his son, William Nassau Dobbs, who was for\r\nmounting the animals, and who expressed a longing to fire off one of the\r\npistols in the holsters.\r\n\r\nAs this family discussion was taking place, the gentlemen whose\r\nappearance had created so much attention came to the door of the inn,\r\nand the elder and stouter was seen to smile at his companion; after\r\nwhich he strolled leisurely over the green, and seemed to examine\r\nwith much benevolent satisfaction the assemblage of villagers who were\r\nstaring at him and the quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock, when he saw the parson's band and cassock, took off his\r\nbeaver reverently, and saluted the divine: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope your reverence won't\r\nbaulk the little fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI think I heard him calling out for\r\na ride, and whether he should like my horse, or his Lordship's horse, I\r\nam sure it is all one. Don't be afraid, sir! the horses are not tired;\r\nwe have only come seventy mile to-day, and Prince Eugene once rode a\r\nmatter of fifty-two leagues (a hundred and fifty miles), sir, upon that\r\nhorse, between sunrise and sunset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious powers! on which horse?\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Dobbs, very solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn THIS, sir,--on mine, Corporal Brock of Cutts's black gelding,\r\n'William of Nassau.' The Prince, sir, gave it me after Blenheim fight,\r\nfor I had my own legs carried away by a cannon-ball, just as I cut down\r\ntwo of Sauerkrauter's regiment, who had made the Prince prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour own legs, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cGracious goodness! this is more\r\nand more astonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not my own legs, my horse's I mean, sir; and the Prince gave me\r\n'William of Nassau' that very day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this no direct reply was made; but the Doctor looked at Mrs. Dobbs,\r\nand Mrs. Dobbs and the rest of the children at her eldest son, who\r\ngrinned and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIsn't it wonderful?\xe2\x80\x9d The Corporal to this answered\r\nnothing, but, resuming his account, pointed to the other horse and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHAT horse, sir--good as mine is--that horse, with the silver stirrups,\r\nis his Excellency's horse, Captain Count Maximilian Gustavus Adolphus\r\nvon Galgenstein, captain of horse and of the Holy Roman Empire\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\nlifted here his hat with much gravity, and all the crowd, even to\r\nthe parson, did likewise). \xe2\x80\x9cWe call him 'George of Denmark,' sir, in\r\ncompliment to Her Majesty's husband: he is Blenheim too, sir; Marshal\r\nTallard rode him on that day, and you know how HE was taken prisoner by\r\nthe Count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge of Denmark, Marshal Tallard, William of Nassau! this is strange\r\nindeed, most wonderful! Why, sir, little are you aware that there are\r\nbefore you, AT THIS MOMENT, two other living beings who bear these\r\nvenerated names! My boys, stand forward! Look here, sir: these children\r\nhave been respectively named after our late sovereign and the husband of\r\nour present Queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd very good names too, sir; ay, and very noble little fellows too;\r\nand I propose that, with your reverence and your ladyship's leave,\r\nWilliam Nassau here shall ride on George of Denmark, and George of\r\nDenmark shall ride on William of Nassau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen this speech of the Corporal's was made, the whole crowd set up a\r\nloyal hurrah; and, with much gravity, the two little boys were lifted up\r\ninto the saddles; and the Corporal leading one, entrusted the other to\r\nthe horse-boy, and so together marched stately up and down the green.\r\n\r\nThe popularity which Mr. Brock gained by this manoeuvre was very great;\r\nbut with regard to the names of the horses and children, which coincided\r\nso extraordinarily, it is but fair to state, that the christening of the\r\nquadrupeds had only taken place about two minutes before the dragoon's\r\nappearance on the green. For if the fact must be confessed, he, while\r\nseated near the inn window, had kept a pretty wistful eye upon all going\r\non without; and the horses marching thus to and fro for the wonderment\r\nof the village, were only placards or advertisements for the riders.\r\n\r\nThere was, besides the boy now occupied with the horses, and the\r\nlandlord and landlady of the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle Inn,\xe2\x80\x9d another person connected with\r\nthat establishment--a very smart, handsome, vain, giggling servant-girl,\r\nabout the age of sixteen, who went by the familiar name of Cat, and\r\nattended upon the gentlemen in the parlour, while the landlady was\r\nemployed in cooking their supper in the kitchen. This young person had\r\nbeen educated in the village poor-house, and having been pronounced\r\nby Doctor Dobbs and the schoolmaster the idlest, dirtiest, and most\r\npassionate little minx with whom either had ever had to do, she was,\r\nafter receiving a very small portion of literary instruction (indeed\r\nit must be stated that the young lady did not know her letters), bound\r\napprentice at the age of nine years to Mrs. Score, her relative, and\r\nlandlady of the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle Inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Miss Cat, or Catherine Hall, was a slattern and a minx, Mrs. Score\r\nwas a far superior shrew; and for the seven years of her apprenticeship\r\nthe girl was completely at her mistress's mercy. Yet though wondrously\r\nstingy, jealous, and violent, while her maid was idle and extravagant,\r\nand her husband seemed to abet the girl, Mrs. Score put up with the\r\nwench's airs, idleness, and caprices, without ever wishing to dismiss\r\nher from the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle.\xe2\x80\x9d The fact is, that Miss Catherine was a great\r\nbeauty, and for about two years, since her fame had begun to spread,\r\nthe custom of the inn had also increased vastly. When there was a debate\r\nwhether the farmers, on their way from market, would take t'other pot,\r\nCatherine, by appearing with it, would straightway cause the liquor to\r\nbe swallowed and paid for; and when the traveller who proposed riding\r\nthat night and sleeping at Coventry or Birmingham, was asked by Miss\r\nCatherine whether he would like a fire in his bedroom, he generally was\r\ninduced to occupy it, although he might before have vowed to Mrs. Score\r\nthat he would not for a thousand guineas be absent from home that night.\r\nThe girl had, too, half-a-dozen lovers in the village; and these were\r\nbound in honour to spend their pence at the alehouse she inhabited. O\r\nwoman, lovely woman! what strong resolves canst thou twist round thy\r\nlittle finger! what gunpowder passions canst thou kindle with a single\r\nsparkle of thine eye! what lies and fribble nonsense canst thou make us\r\nlisten to, as they were gospel truth or splendid wit! above all what bad\r\nliquor canst thou make us swallow when thou puttest a kiss within the\r\ncup--and we are content to call the poison wine!\r\n\r\nThe mountain-wine at the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle\xe2\x80\x9d was, in fact, execrable; but Mrs. Cat,\r\nwho served it to the two soldiers, made it so agreeable to them, that\r\nthey found it a passable, even a pleasant task, to swallow the contents\r\nof a second bottle. The miracle had been wrought instantaneously on her\r\nappearance: for whereas at that very moment the Count was employed in\r\ncursing the wine, the landlady, the wine-grower, and the English nation\r\ngenerally, when the young woman entered and (choosing so to\r\ninterpret the oaths) said, \xe2\x80\x9cComing, your honour; I think your honour\r\ncalled\xe2\x80\x9d--Gustavus Adolphus whistled, stared at her very hard, and\r\nseeming quite dumb-stricken by her appearance, contented himself by\r\nswallowing a whole glass of mountain by way of reply.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock was, however, by no means so confounded as his captain: he was\r\nthirty years older than the latter, and in the course of fifty years of\r\nmilitary life had learned to look on the most dangerous enemy, or the\r\nmost beautiful woman, with the like daring, devil-may-care determination\r\nto conquer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d then said that gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9chis honour is a lord; as good\r\nas a lord, that is; for all he allows such humble fellows as I am to\r\ndrink with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine dropped a low curtsey, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don't know if you\r\nare joking a poor country girl, as all you soldier gentlemen do; but his\r\nhonour LOOKS like a lord: though I never see one, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, gathering courage, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you know I look\r\nlike one, pretty Mary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty Catherine: I mean Catherine, if you please, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Brock burst into a roar of laughter, and shouting with many\r\noaths that she was right at first, invited her to give him what he\r\ncalled a buss.\r\n\r\nPretty Catherine turned away from him at this request, and muttered\r\nsomething about \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your distance, low fellow! buss indeed; poor\r\ncountry girl,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. etc., placing herself, as if for protection, on the\r\nside of the Captain. That gentleman looked also very angry; but whether\r\nat the sight of innocence so outraged, or the insolence of the Corporal\r\nfor daring to help himself first, we cannot say. \xe2\x80\x9cHark ye, Mr. Brock,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he cried very fiercely, \xe2\x80\x9cI will suffer no such liberties in my presence:\r\nremember, it is only my condescension which permits you to share my\r\nbottle in this way; take care I don't give you instead a taste of my\r\ncane.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he, in a protecting manner, placed one hand round\r\nMrs. Catherine's waist, holding the other clenched very near to the\r\nCorporal's nose.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catherine, for HER share of this action of the Count's, dropped\r\nanother curtsey and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d But Galgenstein's threat\r\ndid not appear to make any impression on Mr. Brock, as indeed there was\r\nno reason that it should; for the Corporal, at a combat of fisticuffs,\r\ncould have pounded his commander into a jelly in ten minutes; so he\r\ncontented himself by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, noble Captain, there's no harm done;\r\nit IS an honour for poor old Peter Brock to be at table with you, and I\r\nAM sorry, sure enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, Peter, I believe thou art; thou hast good reason, eh, Peter?\r\nBut never fear, man; had I struck thee, I never would have hurt thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI KNOW you would not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Brock, laying his hand on his heart\r\nwith much gravity; and so peace was made, and healths were drunk. Miss\r\nCatherine condescended to put her lips to the Captain's glass; who swore\r\nthat the wine was thus converted into nectar; and although the girl had\r\nnot previously heard of that liquor, she received the compliment as a\r\ncompliment, and smiled and simpered in return.\r\n\r\nThe poor thing had never before seen anybody so handsome, or so finely\r\ndressed as the Count; and, in the simplicity of her coquetry, allowed\r\nher satisfaction to be quite visible. Nothing could be more clumsy than\r\nthe gentleman's mode of complimenting her; but for this, perhaps, his\r\nspeeches were more effective than others more delicate would have been;\r\nand though she said to each, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, now, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLa, Captain, how\r\ncan you flatter one so?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYour honour's laughing at me,\xe2\x80\x9d and made\r\nsuch polite speeches as are used on these occasions, it was manifest\r\nfrom the flutter and blush, and the grin of satisfaction which lighted\r\nup the buxom features of the little country beauty, that the Count's\r\nfirst operations had been highly successful. When following up his\r\nattack, he produced from his neck a small locket (which had been given\r\nhim by a Dutch lady at the Brill), and begged Miss Catherine to wear it\r\nfor his sake, and chucked her under the chin and called her his little\r\nrosebud, it was pretty clear how things would go: anybody who could see\r\nthe expression of Mr. Brock's countenance at this event might judge of\r\nthe progress of the irresistible High-Dutch conqueror.\r\n\r\nBeing of a very vain communicative turn, our fair barmaid gave her two\r\ncompanions, not only a pretty long account of herself, but of many other\r\npersons in the village, whom she could perceive from the window opposite\r\nto which she stood. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said she--\xe2\x80\x9cmy Lord, I mean;\r\nsixteen last March, though there's a many girl in the village that at\r\nmy age is quite chits. There's Polly Randall now, that red-haired girl\r\nalong with Thomas Curtis: she's seventeen if she's a day, though he is\r\nthe very first sweetheart she has had. Well, as I am saying, I was bred\r\nup here in the village--father and mother died very young, and I was\r\nleft a poor orphan--well, bless us! if Thomas haven't kissed her!--to\r\nthe care of Mrs. Score, my aunt, who has been a mother to me--a\r\nstepmother, you know;--and I've been to Stratford fair, and to Warwick\r\nmany a time; and there's two people who have offered to marry me, and\r\never so many who want to, and I won't have none--only a gentleman,\r\nas I've always said; not a poor clodpole, like Tom there with the red\r\nwaistcoat (he was one that asked me), nor a drunken fellow like Sam\r\nBlacksmith yonder, him whose wife has got the black eye, but a real\r\ngentleman, like--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike whom, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, encouraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, sir, how can you? Why, like our squire, Sir John, who rides in\r\nsuch a mortal fine gold coach; or, at least, like the parson, Doctor\r\nDobbs--that's he, in the black gown, walking with Madam Dobbs in red.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are those his children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: two girls and two boys; and only think, he calls one William\r\nNassau, and one George Denmark--isn't it odd?\xe2\x80\x9d And from the parson, Mrs.\r\nCatherine went on to speak of several humble personages of the village\r\ncommunity, who, as they are not necessary to our story, need not be\r\ndescribed at full length. It was when, from the window, Corporal Brock\r\nsaw the altercation between the worthy divine and his son, respecting\r\nthe latter's ride, that he judged it a fitting time to step out on the\r\ngreen, and to bestow on the two horses those famous historical names\r\nwhich we have just heard applied to them.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock's diplomacy was, as we have stated, quite successful; for,\r\nwhen the parson's boys had ridden and retired along with their mamma and\r\npapa, other young gentlemen of humbler rank in the village were placed\r\nupon \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge of Denmark\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam of Nassau;\xe2\x80\x9d the Corporal joking\r\nand laughing with all the grown-up people. The women, in spite of Mr.\r\nBrock's age, his red nose, and a certain squint of his eye, vowed the\r\nCorporal was a jewel of a man; and among the men his popularity was\r\nequally great.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much dost thee get, Thomas Clodpole?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock to a\r\ncountryman (he was the man whom Mrs. Catherine had described as her\r\nsuitor), who had laughed loudest at some of his jokes: \xe2\x80\x9chow much dost\r\nthee get for a week's work, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Clodpole, whose name was really Bullock, stated that his wages\r\namounted to \xe2\x80\x9cthree shillings and a puddn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree shillings and a puddn!--monstrous!--and for this you toil like a\r\ngalley-slave, as I have seen them in Turkey and America,--ay, gentlemen,\r\nand in the country of Prester John! You shiver out of bed on icy winter\r\nmornings, to break the ice for Ball and Dapple to drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the person addressed, who seemed astounded at the\r\nextent of the Corporal's information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr you clean pigsty, and take dung down to meadow; or you act watchdog\r\nand tend sheep; or you sweep a scythe over a great field of grass; and\r\nwhen the sun has scorched the eyes out of your head, and sweated the\r\nflesh off your bones, and well-nigh fried the soul out of your body,\r\nyou go home, to what?--three shillings a week and a puddn! Do you get\r\npudding every day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; only Sundays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you get money enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you get beer enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, NEVER!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bullock quite resolutely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorthy Clodpole, give us thy hand: it shall have beer enough this day,\r\nor my name's not Corporal Brock. Here's the money, boy! there are twenty\r\npieces in this purse: and how do you think I got 'em? and how do you\r\nthink I shall get others when these are gone?--by serving Her Sacred\r\nMajesty, to be sure: long life to her, and down with the French King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBullock, a few of the men, and two or three of the boys, piped out\r\nan hurrah, in compliment to this speech of the Corporal's: but it\r\nwas remarked that the greater part of the crowd drew back--the women\r\nwhispering ominously to them and looking at the Corporal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, ladies, what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are frightened, and think I\r\nam a crimp come to steal your sweethearts away. What! call Peter Brock a\r\ndouble-dealer? I tell you what, boys, Jack Churchill himself has shaken\r\nthis hand, and drunk a pot with me: do you think he'd shake hands with\r\na rogue? Here's Tummas Clodpole has never had beer enough, and here am\r\nI will stand treat to him and any other gentleman: am I good enough\r\ncompany for him? I have money, look you, and like to spend it: what\r\nshould _I_ be doing dirty actions for--hay, Tummas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA satisfactory reply to this query was not, of course, expected by the\r\nCorporal nor uttered by Mr. Bullock; and the end of the dispute was,\r\nthat he and three or four of the rustic bystanders were quite convinced\r\nof the good intentions of their new friend, and accompanied him back\r\nto the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle,\xe2\x80\x9d to regale upon the promised beer. Among the Corporal's\r\nguests was one young fellow whose dress would show that he was somewhat\r\nbetter to do in the world than Clodpole and the rest of the sunburnt\r\nragged troop, who were marching towards the alehouse. This man was the\r\nonly one of his hearers who, perhaps, was sceptical as to the truth of\r\nhis stories; but as soon as Bullock accepted the invitation to drink,\r\nJohn Hayes, the carpenter (for such was his name and profession), said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Thomas, if thou goest, I will go too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know thee wilt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomas: \xe2\x80\x9cthou'lt goo anywhere Catty Hall is,\r\nprovided thou canst goo for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I have a penny to spend as good as the Corporal here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA penny to KEEP, you mean: for all your love for the lass at the\r\n'Bugle,' did thee ever spend a shilling in the house? Thee wouldn't go\r\nnow, but that I am going too, and the Captain here stands treat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, gentlemen, no quarrelling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this pretty\r\nfellow will join us, amen say I: there's lots of liquor, and plenty\r\nof money to pay the score. Comrade Tummas, give us thy arm. Mr. Hayes,\r\nyou're a hearty cock, I make no doubt, and all such are welcome. Come\r\nalong, my gentleman farmers, Mr. Brock shall have the honour to pay for\r\nyou all.\xe2\x80\x9d And with this, Corporal Brock, accompanied by Messrs. Hayes,\r\nBullock, Blacksmith, Baker's-boy, Butcher, and one or two others,\r\nadjourned to the inn; the horses being, at the same time, conducted to\r\nthe stable.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have, in this quiet way, and without any flourishing of\r\ntrumpets, or beginning of chapters, introduced Mr. Hayes to the public;\r\nand although, at first sight, a sneaking carpenter's boy may seem hardly\r\nworthy of the notice of an intelligent reader, who looks for a good\r\ncut-throat or highwayman for a hero, or a pickpocket at the very least:\r\nthis gentleman's words and actions should be carefully studied by the\r\npublic, as he is destined to appear before them under very polite and\r\ncurious circumstances during the course of this history. The speech of\r\nthe rustic Juvenal, Mr. Clodpole, had seemed to infer that Hayes was at\r\nonce careful of his money and a warm admirer of Mrs. Catherine of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBugle:\xe2\x80\x9d and both the charges were perfectly true. Hayes's father\r\nwas reported to be a man of some substance; and young John, who was\r\nperforming his apprenticeship in the village, did not fail to talk very\r\nbig of his pretensions to fortune--of his entering, at the close of his\r\nindentures, into partnership with his father--and of the comfortable\r\nfarm and house over which Mrs. John Hayes, whoever she might be, would\r\none day preside. Thus, next to the barber and butcher, and above even\r\nhis own master, Mr. Hayes took rank in the village: and it must not be\r\nconcealed that his representation of wealth had made some impression\r\nupon Mrs. Hall toward whom the young gentleman had cast the eyes of\r\naffection. If he had been tolerably well-looking, and not pale, rickety,\r\nand feeble as he was; if even he had been ugly, but withal a man of\r\nspirit, it is probable the girl's kindness for him would have been\r\nmuch more decided. But he was a poor weak creature, not to compare\r\nwith honest Thomas Bullock, by at least nine inches; and so notoriously\r\ntimid, selfish, and stingy, that there was a kind of shame in receiving\r\nhis addresses openly; and what encouragement Mrs. Catherine gave him\r\ncould only be in secret.\r\n\r\nBut no mortal is wise at all times: and the fact was, that Hayes, who\r\ncared for himself intensely, had set his heart upon winning Catherine;\r\nand loved her with a desperate greedy eagerness and desire of\r\npossession, which makes passions for women often so fierce and\r\nunreasonable among very cold and selfish men. His parents (whose\r\nfrugality he had inherited) had tried in vain to wean him from this\r\npassion, and had made many fruitless attempts to engage him with women\r\nwho possessed money and desired husbands; but Hayes was, for a wonder,\r\nquite proof against their attractions; and, though quite ready\r\nto acknowledge the absurdity of his love for a penniless alehouse\r\nservant-girl, nevertheless persisted in it doggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I'm a\r\nfool,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cand what's more, the girl does not care for me; but\r\nmarry her I must, or I think I shall just die: and marry her I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n For very much to the credit of Miss Catherine's modesty, she had\r\ndeclared that marriage was with her a sine qua non, and had dismissed,\r\nwith the loudest scorn and indignation, all propositions of a less\r\nproper nature.\r\n\r\nPoor Thomas Bullock was another of her admirers, and had offered to\r\nmarry her; but three shillings a week and a puddn was not to the girl's\r\ntaste, and Thomas had been scornfully rejected. Hayes had also made her\r\na direct proposal. Catherine did not say no: she was too prudent: but\r\nshe was young and could wait; she did not care for Mr. Hayes yet enough\r\nto marry him--(it did not seem, indeed, in the young woman's nature to\r\ncare for anybody)--and she gave her adorer flatteringly to understand\r\nthat, if nobody better appeared in the course of a few years, she might\r\nbe induced to become Mrs. Hayes. It was a dismal prospect for the\r\npoor fellow to live upon the hope of being one day Mrs. Catherine's\r\npis-aller.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime she considered herself free as the wind, and permitted\r\nherself all the innocent gaieties which that \xe2\x80\x9cchartered libertine,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\ncoquette, can take. She flirted with all the bachelors, widowers, and\r\nmarried men, in a manner which did extraordinary credit to her years:\r\nand let not the reader fancy such pastimes unnatural at her early age.\r\nThe ladies--Heaven bless them!--are, as a general rule, coquettes from\r\nbabyhood upwards. Little SHE'S of three years old play little airs and\r\ngraces upon small heroes of five; simpering misses of nine make attacks\r\nupon young gentlemen of twelve; and at sixteen, a well-grown girl, under\r\nencouraging circumstances--say, she is pretty, in a family of ugly elder\r\nsisters, or an only child and heiress, or a humble wench at a country\r\ninn, like our fair Catherine--is at the very pink and prime of her\r\ncoquetry: they will jilt you at that age with an ease and arch infantine\r\nsimplicity that never can be surpassed in maturer years.\r\n\r\nMiss Catherine, then, was a franche coquette, and Mr. John Hayes was\r\nmiserable. His life was passed in a storm of mean passions and bitter\r\njealousies, and desperate attacks upon the indifference-rock of Mrs.\r\nCatherine's heart, which not all his tempest of love could beat down. O\r\ncruel cruel pangs of love unrequited! Mean rogues feel them as well as\r\ngreat heroes. Lives there the man in Europe who has not felt them many\r\ntimes?--who has not knelt, and fawned, and supplicated, and wept, and\r\ncursed, and raved, all in vain; and passed long wakeful nights with\r\nghosts of dead hopes for company; shadows of buried remembrances that\r\nglide out of their graves of nights, and whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are dead now,\r\nbut we WERE once; and we made you happy, and we come now to mock\r\nyou:--despair, O lover, despair, and die\xe2\x80\x9d?--O cruel pangs!--dismal\r\nnights!--Now a sly demon creeps under your nightcap, and drops into\r\nyour ear those soft hope-breathing sweet words, uttered on the\r\nwell-remembered evening: there, in the drawer of your dressing-table\r\n(along with the razors, and Macassar oil), lies the dead flower that\r\nLady Amelia Wilhelmina wore in her bosom on the night of a certain\r\nball--the corpse of a glorious hope that seemed once as if it would live\r\nfor ever, so strong was it, so full of joy and sunshine: there, in\r\nyour writing-desk, among a crowd of unpaid bills, is the dirty scrap of\r\npaper, thimble-sealed, which came in company with a pair of muffetees of\r\nher knitting (she was a butcher's daughter, and did all she could, poor\r\nthing!), begging \xe2\x80\x9cyou would ware them at collidge, and think of her\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x9d--married a public-house three weeks afterwards, and cares for you\r\nno more now than she does for the pot-boy. But why multiply instances,\r\nor seek to depict the agony of poor mean-spirited John Hayes? No mistake\r\ncan be greater than that of fancying such great emotions of love are\r\nonly felt by virtuous or exalted men: depend upon it, Love, like Death,\r\nplays havoc among the pauperum tabernas, and sports with rich and poor,\r\nwicked and virtuous, alike. I have often fancied, for instance, on\r\nseeing the haggard pale young old-clothesman, who wakes the echoes of\r\nour street with his nasal cry of \xe2\x80\x9cClo'!\xe2\x80\x9d--I have often, I said, fancied\r\nthat, besides the load of exuvial coats and breeches under which\r\nhe staggers, there is another weight on him--an atrior cura at his\r\ntail--and while his unshorn lips and nose together are performing that\r\nmocking, boisterous, Jack-indifferent cry of \xe2\x80\x9cClo', clo'!\xe2\x80\x9d who knows\r\nwhat woeful utterances are crying from the heart within? There he is,\r\nchaffering with the footman at No. 7 about an old dressing-gown: you\r\nthink his whole soul is bent only on the contest about the garment.\r\nPsha! there is, perhaps, some faithless girl in Holywell Street who\r\nfills up his heart; and that desultory Jew-boy is a peripatetic hell!\r\nTake another instance:--take the man in the beef-shop in Saint Martin's\r\nCourt. There he is, to all appearances quite calm: before the same round\r\nof beef--from morning till sundown--for hundreds of years very likely.\r\nPerhaps when the shutters are closed, and all the world tired and\r\nsilent, there is HE silent, but untired--cutting, cutting, cutting. You\r\nenter, you get your meat to your liking, you depart; and, quite unmoved,\r\non, on he goes, reaping ceaselessly the Great Harvest of Beef. You would\r\nfancy that if Passion ever failed to conquer, it had in vain assailed\r\nthe calm bosom of THAT MAN. I doubt it, and would give much to know his\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWho knows what furious Aetna-flames are raging underneath the surface of\r\nthat calm flesh-mountain--who can tell me that that calmness itself is\r\nnot DESPAIR?\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nThe reader, if he does not now understand why it was that Mr. Hayes\r\nagreed to drink the Corporal's proffered beer, had better just read the\r\nforegoing remarks over again, and if he does not understand THEN, why,\r\nsmall praise to his brains. Hayes could not bear that Mr. Bullock should\r\nhave a chance of seeing, and perhaps making love to Mrs. Catherine in\r\nhis absence; and though the young woman never diminished her coquetries,\r\nbut, on the contrary, rather increased them in his presence, it was\r\nstill a kind of dismal satisfaction to be miserable in her company.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, the disconsolate lover could be wretched to his\r\nheart's content; for Catherine had not a word or a look for him, but\r\nbestowed all her smiles upon the handsome stranger who owned the black\r\nhorse. As for poor Tummas Bullock, his passion was never violent; and\r\nhe was content in the present instance to sigh and drink beer. He sighed\r\nand drank, sighed and drank, and drank again, until he had swallowed so\r\nmuch of the Corporal's liquor, as to be induced to accept a guinea from\r\nhis purse also; and found himself, on returning to reason and sobriety,\r\na soldier of Queen Anne's.\r\n\r\nBut oh! fancy the agonies of Mr. Hayes when, seated with the Corporal's\r\nfriends at one end of the kitchen, he saw the Captain at the place of\r\nhonour, and the smiles which the fair maid bestowed upon him; when, as\r\nshe lightly whisked past him with the Captain's supper, she, pointing\r\nto the locket that once reposed on the breast of the Dutch lady at the\r\nBrill, looked archly on Hayes and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSee, John, what his Lordship\r\nhas given me;\xe2\x80\x9d and when John's face became green and purple with\r\nrage and jealousy, Mrs. Catherine laughed ten times louder, and cried\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d in a voice of shrill triumph, that bored through the\r\nsoul of Mr. John Hayes and left him gasping for breath.\r\n\r\nOn Catherine's other lover, Mr. Thomas, this coquetry had no effect: he,\r\nand two comrades of his, had by this time quite fallen under the spell\r\nof the Corporal; and hope, glory, strong beer, Prince Eugene, pair of\r\ncolours, more strong beer, her blessed Majesty, plenty more strong beer,\r\nand such subjects, martial and bacchic, whirled through their dizzy\r\nbrains at a railroad pace.\r\n\r\nAnd now, if there had been a couple of experienced reporters present at\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBugle Inn,\xe2\x80\x9d they might have taken down a conversation on love\r\nand war--the two themes discussed by the two parties occupying the\r\nkitchen--which, as the parts were sung together, duetwise, formed\r\ntogether some very curious harmonies. Thus, while the Captain was\r\nwhispering the softest nothings, the Corporal was shouting the fiercest\r\ncombats of the war; and, like the gentleman at Penelope's table, on it\r\nexiguo pinxit praelia tota bero. For example:\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN. What do you say to a silver trimming, pretty Catherine? Don't\r\nyou think a scarlet riding-cloak, handsomely laced, would become you\r\nwonderfully well?--and a grey hat with a blue feather--and a pretty nag\r\nto ride on--and all the soldiers to present arms as you pass, and say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere goes the Captain's lady\xe2\x80\x9d? What do you think of a side-box at\r\nLincoln's Inn playhouse, or of standing up to a minuet with my Lord\r\nMarquis at--?\r\n\r\nCORPORAL. The ball, sir, ran right up his elbow, and was found the next\r\nday by Surgeon Splinter of ours,--where do you think, sir?--upon my\r\nhonour as a gentleman it came out of the nape of his--\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN. Necklace--and a sweet pair of diamond earrings, mayhap--and a\r\nlittle shower of patches, which ornament a lady's face wondrously--and\r\na leetle rouge--though, egad! such peach-cheeks as yours don't want\r\nit;--fie! Mrs. Catherine, I should think the birds must come and peck at\r\nthem as if they were fruit--\r\n\r\nCORPORAL. Over the wall; and three-and-twenty of our fellows jumped\r\nafter me. By the Pope of Rome, friend Tummas, that was a day!--Had you\r\nseen how the Mounseers looked when four-and-twenty rampaging he-devils,\r\nsword and pistol, cut and thrust, pell-mell came tumbling into the\r\nredoubt! Why, sir, we left in three minutes as many artillerymen's heads\r\nas there were cannon-balls. It was, \xe2\x80\x9cAh sacre!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cD----- you, take that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cO mon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cRun him through!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cVentrebleu!\xe2\x80\x9d and it WAS ventrebleu\r\nwith him, I warrant you; for bleu, in the French language, means\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthrough;\xe2\x80\x9d and ventre--why, you see, ventre means--\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN. Waists, which are worn now excessive long; and for the hoops,\r\nif you COULD but see them--stap my vitals, my dear, but there was a lady\r\nat Warwick's Assembly (she came in one of my Lord's coaches) who had a\r\nhoop as big as a tent: you might have dined under it comfortably;--ha!\r\nha! 'pon my faith, now--\r\n\r\nCORPORAL. And there we found the Duke of Marlborough seated along with\r\nMarshal Tallard, who was endeavouring to drown his sorrow over a cup of\r\nJohannisberger wine; and a good drink too, my lads, only not to compare\r\nto Warwick beer. \xe2\x80\x9cWho was the man who has done this?\xe2\x80\x9d said our noble\r\nGeneral. I stepped up. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many heads was it,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you cut\r\noff?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNineteen,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cbesides wounding several.\xe2\x80\x9d When he heard it\r\n(Mr. Hayes, you don't drink) I'm blest if he didn't burst into tears!\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoble noble fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cMarshal, you must excuse me if I am\r\npleased to hear of the destruction of your countrymen. Noble noble\r\nfellow!--here's a hundred guineas for you.\xe2\x80\x9d Which sum he placed in my\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Marshal \xe2\x80\x9cthe man has done his duty:\xe2\x80\x9d and, pulling\r\nout a magnificent gold diamond-hilted snuff-box, he gave me--\r\n\r\nMR. BULLOCK. What, a goold snuff-box? Wauns, but thee WAST in luck,\r\nCorporal!\r\n\r\nCORPORAL. No, not the snuff-box, but--A PINCH OF SNUFF,--ha! ha!--run me\r\nthrough the body if he didn't. Could you but have seen the smile on\r\nJack Churchill's grave face at this piece of generosity! So, beckoning\r\nColonel Cadogan up to him, he pinched his Ear and whispered--\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I have the honour to dance a minuet with your Ladyship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The whole room was in titters at Jack's blunder; for, as you know very\r\nwell, poor Lady Susan HAS A WOODEN LEG. Ha! ha! fancy a minuet and a\r\nwooden leg, hey, my dear?--\r\n\r\nMRS. CATHERINE. Giggle--giggle--giggle: he! he! he! Oh, Captain, you\r\nrogue, you--\r\n\r\nSECOND TABLE. Haw! haw! haw! Well you be a foony mon, Sergeant, zure\r\nenoff.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nThis little specimen of the conversation must be sufficient. It will\r\nshow pretty clearly that EACH of the two military commanders was\r\nconducting his operations with perfect success. Three of the detachment\r\nof five attacked by the Corporal surrendered to him: Mr. Bullock,\r\nnamely, who gave in at a very early stage of the evening, and\r\nignominiously laid down his arms under the table, after standing not\r\nmore than a dozen volleys of beer; Mr. Blacksmith's boy, and a labourer\r\nwhose name we have not been able to learn. Mr. Butcher himself was on\r\nthe point of yielding, when he was rescued by the furious charge of a\r\ndetachment that marched to his relief: his wife namely, who, with two\r\nsqualling children, rushed into the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle,\xe2\x80\x9d boxed Butcher's ears, and\r\nkept up such a tremendous fire of oaths and screams upon the Corporal,\r\nthat he was obliged to retreat. Fixing then her claws into Mr. Butcher's\r\nhair, she proceeded to drag him out of the premises; and thus Mr. Brock\r\nwas overcome. His attack upon John Hayes was a still greater failure;\r\nfor that young man seemed to be invincible by drink, if not by love:\r\nand at the end of the drinking-bout was a great deal more cool than\r\nthe Corporal himself; to whom he wished a very polite good-evening, as\r\ncalmly he took his hat to depart. He turned to look at Catherine, to be\r\nsure, and then he was not quite so calm: but Catherine did not give any\r\nreply to his good-night. She was seated at the Captain's table playing\r\nat cribbage with him; and though Count Gustavus Maximilian lost every\r\ngame, he won more than he lost,--sly fellow!--and Mrs. Catherine was no\r\nmatch for him.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presumed that Hayes gave some information to Mrs. Score,\r\nthe landlady: for, on leaving the kitchen, he was seen to linger for a\r\nmoment in the bar; and very soon after Mrs. Catherine was called away\r\nfrom her attendance on the Count, who, when he asked for a sack and\r\ntoast, was furnished with those articles by the landlady herself: and,\r\nduring the half-hour in which he was employed in consuming this drink,\r\nMonsieur de Galgenstein looked very much disturbed and out of humour,\r\nand cast his eyes to the door perpetually; but no Catherine came. At\r\nlast, very sulkily, he desired to be shown to bed, and walked as well as\r\nhe could (for, to say truth, the noble Count was by this time somewhat\r\nunsteady on his legs) to his chamber. It was Mrs. Score who showed\r\nhim to it, and closed the curtains, and pointed triumphantly to the\r\nwhiteness of the sheets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a very comfortable room,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthough not the best in the\r\nhouse; which belong of right to your Lordship's worship; but our\r\nbest room has two beds, and Mr. Corporal is in that, locked and\r\ndouble-locked, with his three tipsy recruits. But your honour will find\r\nthis here bed comfortable and well-aired; I've slept in it myself this\r\neighteen years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my good woman, you are going to sit up, eh? It's cruel hard on\r\nyou, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit up, my Lord? bless you, no! I shall have half of our Cat's bed; as\r\nI always do when there's company.\xe2\x80\x9d And with this Mrs. Score curtseyed\r\nand retired.\r\n\r\nVery early the next morning the active landlady and her bustling\r\nattendant had prepared the ale and bacon for the Corporal and his three\r\nconverts, and had set a nice white cloth for the Captain's breakfast.\r\nThe young blacksmith did not eat with much satisfaction; but Mr. Bullock\r\nand his friend betrayed no sign of discontent, except such as may be\r\nconsequent upon an evening's carouse. They walked very contentedly to be\r\nregistered before Doctor Dobbs, who was also justice of the peace, and\r\nwent in search of their slender bundles, and took leave of their few\r\nacquaintances without much regret: for the gentlemen had been bred in\r\nthe workhouse, and had not, therefore, a large circle of friends.\r\n\r\nIt wanted only an hour of noon, and the noble Count had not descended.\r\nThe men were waiting for him, and spent much of the Queen's money\r\n(earned by the sale of their bodies overnight) while thus expecting him.\r\nPerhaps Mrs. Catherine expected him too, for she had offered many times\r\nto run up--with my Lord's boots--with the hot water--to show Mr. Brock\r\nthe way; who sometimes condescended to officiate as barber. But on all\r\nthese occasions Mrs. Score had prevented her; not scolding, but with\r\nmuch gentleness and smiling. At last, more gentle and smiling than ever,\r\nshe came downstairs and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCatherine darling, his honour the Count\r\nis mighty hungry this morning, and vows he could pick the wing of a\r\nfowl. Run down, child, to Farmer Brigg's and get one: pluck it\r\nbefore you bring it, you know, and we will make his Lordship a pretty\r\nbreakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine took up her basket, and away she went by the back-yard,\r\nthrough the stables. There she heard the little horse-boy whistling and\r\nhissing after the manner of horseboys; and there she learned that Mrs.\r\nScore had been inventing an ingenious story to have her out of the way.\r\nThe ostler said he was just going to lead the two horses round to the\r\ndoor. The Corporal had been, and they were about to start on the instant\r\nfor Stratford.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Count Gustavus Adolphus, far from wishing to pick the\r\nwing of a fowl, had risen with a horror and loathing for everything in\r\nthe shape of food, and for any liquor stronger than small beer. Of this\r\nhe had drunk a cup, and said he should ride immediately to Stratford;\r\nand when, on ordering his horses, he had asked politely of the landlady\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhy the d---- SHE always came up, and why she did not send the girl,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mrs. Score informed the Count that her Catherine was gone out for a walk\r\nalong with the young man to whom she was to be married, and would not\r\nbe visible that day. On hearing this the Captain ordered his horses\r\nthat moment, and abused the wine, the bed, the house, the landlady, and\r\neverything connected with the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle Inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut the horses came: the little boys of the village gathered round; the\r\nrecruits, with bunches of ribands in their beavers, appeared presently;\r\nCorporal Brock came swaggering out, and, slapping the pleased blacksmith\r\non the back, bade him mount his horse; while the boys hurrah'd. Then the\r\nCaptain came out, gloomy and majestic; to him Mr. Brock made a military\r\nsalute, which clumsily, and with much grinning, the recruits imitated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall walk on with these brave fellows, your honour, and meet you at\r\nStratford,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Corporal. \xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, as he\r\nmounted. The landlady curtseyed; the children hurrah'd more; the little\r\nhorse-boy, who held the bridle with one hand and the stirrup with the\r\nother, and expected a crown-piece from such a noble gentleman, got only\r\na kick and a curse, as Count von Galgenstein shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cD----- you all,\r\nget out of the way!\xe2\x80\x9d and galloped off; and John Hayes, who had been\r\nsneaking about the inn all the morning, felt a weight off his heart when\r\nhe saw the Captain ride off alone.\r\n\r\nO foolish Mrs. Score! O dolt of a John Hayes! If the landlady had\r\nallowed the Captain and the maid to have their way, and meet but for a\r\nminute before recruits, sergeant, and all, it is probable that no\r\nharm would have been done, and that this history would never have been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nWhen Count von Galgenstein had ridden half a mile on the Stratford road,\r\nlooking as black and dismal as Napoleon galloping from the romantic\r\nvillage of Waterloo, he espied, a few score yards onwards, at the\r\nturn of the road, a certain object which caused him to check his horse\r\nsuddenly, brought a tingling red into his cheeks, and made his heart to\r\ngo thump--thump! against his side. A young lass was sauntering slowly\r\nalong the footpath, with a basket swinging from one hand, and a bunch of\r\nhedge-flowers in the other. She stopped once or twice to add a fresh one\r\nto her nosegay, and might have seen him, the Captain thought; but\r\nno, she never looked directly towards him, and still walked on. Sweet\r\ninnocent! she was singing as if none were near; her voice went soaring\r\nup to the clear sky, and the Captain put his horse on the grass, that\r\nthe sound of the hoofs might not disturb the music.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the kine had given a pailful,\r\n        And the sheep came bleating home,\r\n      Poll, who knew it would be healthful,\r\n        Went a-walking out with Tom.\r\n      Hand in hand, sir, on the land, sir,\r\n        As they walked to and fro,\r\n      Tom made jolly love to Polly,\r\n        But was answered no, no, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain had put his horse on the grass, that the sound of his hoofs\r\nmight not disturb the music; and now he pushed its head on to the bank,\r\nwhere straightway \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge of Denmark\xe2\x80\x9d began chewing of such a salad\r\nas grew there. And now the Captain slid off stealthily; and smiling\r\ncomically, and hitching up his great jack-boots, and moving forward with\r\na jerking tiptoe step, he, just as she was trilling the last o-o-o\r\nof the last no in the above poem of Tom D'Urfey, came up to her, and\r\ntouching her lightly on the waist, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, your very humble servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Catherine (you know you have found her out long ago!) gave a scream\r\nand a start, and would have turned pale if she could. As it was, she\r\nonly shook all over, and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, how you DID frighten me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrighten you, my rosebud! why, run me through, I'd die rather than\r\nfrighten you. Gad, child, tell me now, am I so VERY frightful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, your honour, I didn't mean that; only I wasn't thinking to meet\r\nyou here, or that you would ride so early at all: for, if you please,\r\nsir, I was going to fetch a chicken for your Lordship's breakfast, as\r\nmy mistress said you would like one; and I thought, instead of going to\r\nFarmer Brigg's, down Birmingham way, as she told me, I'd go to Farmer\r\nBird's, where the chickens is better, sir,--my Lord, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid I'd like a chicken for breakfast, the old cat! why, I told her\r\nI would not eat a morsel to save me--I was so dru--I mean I ate such a\r\ngood supper last night--and I bade her to send me a pot of small beer,\r\nand to tell you to bring it; and the wretch said you were gone out with\r\nyour sweetheart--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! John Hayes, the creature? Oh, what a naughty story-telling\r\nwoman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--You had walked out with your sweetheart, and I was not to see you\r\nany more; and I was mad with rage, and ready to kill myself; I was, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir! pray, PRAY don't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor your sake, my sweet angel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for my sake, if such a poor girl as me can persuade noble\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, for YOUR sake, I won't; no, I'll live; but why live? Hell\r\nand fury, if I do live I'm miserable without you; I am,--you know I\r\nam,--you adorable, beautiful, cruel, wicked Catherine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine's reply to this was \xe2\x80\x9cLa, bless me! I do believe your horse is\r\nrunning away.\xe2\x80\x9d And so he was! for having finished his meal in the hedge,\r\nhe first looked towards his master and paused, as it were, irresolutely;\r\nthen, by a sudden impulse, flinging up his tail and his hind legs, he\r\nscampered down the road.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hall ran lightly after the horse, and the Captain after Mrs. Hall;\r\nand the horse ran quicker and quicker every moment, and might have led\r\nthem a long chase,--when lo! debouching from a twist in the road, came\r\nthe detachment of cavalry and infantry under Mr. Brock. The moment\r\nhe was out of sight of the village, that gentleman had desired the\r\nblacksmith to dismount, and had himself jumped into the saddle,\r\nmaintaining the subordination of his army by drawing a pistol and\r\nswearing that he would blow out the brains of any person who attempted\r\nto run. When the Captain's horse came near the detachment he paused, and\r\nsuffered himself to be caught by Tummas Bullock, who held him until the\r\nowner and Mrs. Catherine came up.\r\n\r\nMr. Bullock looked comically grave when he saw the pair; but the\r\nCorporal graciously saluted Mrs. Catherine, and said it was a fine day\r\nfor walking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, sir, and so it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, panting in a very pretty and\r\ndistressing way, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not for RUNNING. I do protest--ha!--and vow that\r\nI really can scarcely stand. I'm so tired of running after that naughty\r\nnaughty horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do, Cattern?\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomas. \xe2\x80\x9cZee, I be going a zouldiering because\r\nthee wouldn't have me.\xe2\x80\x9d And here Mr. Bullock grinned. Mrs. Catherine\r\nmade no sort of reply, but protested once more she should die of\r\nrunning. If the truth were told, she was somewhat vexed at the arrival\r\nof the Corporal's detachment, and had had very serious thoughts of\r\nfinding herself quite tired just as he came in sight.\r\n\r\nA sudden thought brought a smile of bright satisfaction in the Captain's\r\neyes. He mounted the horse which Tummas still held. \xe2\x80\x9cTIRED, Mrs\r\nCatherine,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand for my sake? By heavens! you shan't walk a\r\nstep farther. No, you shall ride back with a guard of honour! Back to\r\nthe village, gentlemen!--rightabout face! Show those fellows, Corporal,\r\nhow to rightabout face. Now, my dear, mount behind me on Snowball; he's\r\neasy as a sedan. Put your dear little foot on the toe of my boot. There\r\nnow,--up!--jump! hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHAT'S not the way, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted out Thomas, still holding on to\r\nthe rein as the horse began to move. \xe2\x80\x9cThee woan't goo with him, will\r\nthee, Catty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Catherine, though she turned away her head, never let go her\r\nhold round the Captain's waist; and he, swearing a dreadful oath at\r\nThomas, struck him across the face and hands with his riding whip. The\r\npoor fellow, who at the first cut still held on to the rein, dropped it\r\nat the second, and as the pair galloped off, sat down on the roadside\r\nand fairly began to weep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARCH, you dog!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted out the Corporal a minute after. And so he\r\ndid: and when next he saw Mrs. Catherine she WAS the Captain's lady sure\r\nenough, and wore a grey hat, with a blue feather, and red riding-coat\r\ntrimmed with silverlace. But Thomas was then on a bare-backed horse,\r\nwhich Corporal Brock was flanking round a ring, and he was so occupied\r\nlooking between his horse's ears that he had no time to cry then, and at\r\nlength got the better of his attachment.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nThis being a good opportunity for closing Chapter I, we ought, perhaps,\r\nto make some apologies to the public for introducing them to characters\r\nthat are so utterly worthless; as we confess all our heroes, with the\r\nexception of Mr. Bullock, to be. In this we have consulted nature and\r\nhistory, rather than the prevailing taste and the general manner of\r\nauthors. The amusing novel of \xe2\x80\x9cErnest Maltravers,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance, opens\r\nwith a seduction; but then it is performed by people of the strictest\r\nvirtue on both sides: and there is so much religion and philosophy in\r\nthe heart of the seducer, so much tender innocence in the soul of the\r\nseduced, that--bless the little dears!--their very peccadilloes make\r\none interested in them; and their naughtiness becomes quite sacred, so\r\ndeliciously is it described. Now, if we ARE to be interested by rascally\r\nactions, let us have them with plain faces, and let them be performed,\r\nnot by virtuous philosophers, but by rascals. Another clever class of\r\nnovelists adopt the contrary system, and create interest by making their\r\nrascals perform virtuous actions. Against these popular plans we here\r\nsolemnly appeal. We say, let your rogues in novels act like rogues,\r\nand your honest men like honest men; don't let us have any juggling\r\nand thimble-rigging with virtue and vice, so that, at the end of three\r\nvolumes, the bewildered reader shall not know which is which; don't let\r\nus find ourselves kindling at the generous qualities of thieves, and\r\nsympathising with the rascalities of noble hearts. For our own part, we\r\nknow what the public likes, and have chosen rogues for our characters,\r\nand have taken a story from the \xe2\x80\x9cNewgate Calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d which we hope to\r\nfollow out to edification. Among the rogues, at least, we will have\r\nnothing that shall be mistaken for virtues. And if the British public\r\n(after calling for three or four editions) shall give up, not only our\r\nrascals, but the rascals of all other authors, we shall be content:--we\r\nshall apply to Government for a pension, and think that our duty is\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. IN WHICH ARE DEPICTED THE PLEASURES OF A SENTIMENTAL\r\nATTACHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary, for the purpose of this history, to follow out\r\nvery closely all the adventures which occurred to Mrs. Catherine from\r\nthe period when she quitted the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle\xe2\x80\x9d and became the Captain's lady;\r\nfor although it would be just as easy to show as not, that the young\r\nwoman, by following the man of her heart, had only yielded to an\r\ninnocent impulse, and by remaining with him for a certain period, had\r\nproved the depth and strength of her affection for him,--although we\r\nmight make very tender and eloquent apologies for the error of both\r\nparties, the reader might possibly be disgusted at such descriptions\r\nand such arguments: which, besides, are already done to his hand in the\r\nnovel of \xe2\x80\x9cErnest Maltravers\xe2\x80\x9d before mentioned.\r\n\r\nFrom the gentleman's manner towards Mrs. Catherine, and from his\r\nbrilliant and immediate success, the reader will doubtless have\r\nconcluded, in the first place, that Gustavus Adolphus had not a very\r\nviolent affection for Mrs. Cat; in the second place, that he was a\r\nprofessional lady-killer, and therefore likely at some period to resume\r\nhis profession; thirdly, and to conclude, that a connection so begun,\r\nmust, in the nature of things, be likely to end speedily.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to do the Count justice, it would, if he had been allowed to\r\nfollow his own inclination entirely; for (as many young gentlemen will,\r\nand yet no praise to them) in about a week he began to be indifferent,\r\nin a month to be weary, in two months to be angry, in three to proceed\r\nto blows and curses; and, in short, to repent most bitterly the hour\r\nwhen he had ever been induced to present Mrs. Catherine the toe of his\r\nboot, for the purpose of lifting her on to his horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEgad!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the Corporal one day, when confiding his griefs to\r\nMr. Brock, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish my toe had been cut off before ever it served as a\r\nladder to this little vixen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr perhaps your honour would wish to kick her downstairs with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n delicately suggested Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKick her! why, the wench would hold so fast by the banisters that I\r\nCOULD not kick her down, Mr. Brock. To tell you a bit of a secret, I\r\nHAVE tried as much--not to kick her--no, no, not kick her, certainly:\r\nthat's ungentlemanly--but to INDUCE her to go back to that cursed\r\npot-house where we fell in with her. I have given her many hints--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I saw your honour give her one yesterday--with a mug of beer.\r\nBy the laws, as the ale run all down her face, and she clutched a knife\r\nto run at you, I don't think I ever saw such a she-devil! That woman\r\nwill do for your honour some day, if you provoke her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo for ME? No, hang it, Mr. Brock, never! She loves every hair of my\r\nhead, sir: she worships me, Corporal. Egad, yes! she worships me; and\r\nwould much sooner apply a knife to her own weasand than scratch my\r\nlittle finger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen, look you, are like dogs,\r\nthey like to be ill-treated: they like it, sir; I know they do. I never\r\nhad anything to do with a woman in my life but I ill-treated her, and\r\nshe liked me the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Hall ought to be VERY fond of you then, sure enough!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nCorporal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery fond;--ha, ha! Corporal, you wag you--and so she IS very fond.\r\nYesterday, after the knife-and-beer scene--no wonder I threw the liquor\r\nin her face: it was so dev'lish flat that no gentleman could drink it:\r\nand I told her never to draw it till dinner-time--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was enough to put an angel in a fury!\xe2\x80\x9d said Brock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yesterday, after the knife business, when you had got the carver\r\nout of her hand, off she flings to her bedroom, will not eat a bit of\r\ndinner forsooth, and remains locked up for a couple of hours. At\r\ntwo o'clock afternoon (I was over a tankard), out comes the little\r\nshe-devil, her face pale, her eyes bleared, and the tip of her nose as\r\nred as fire with sniffling and weeping. Making for my hand, 'Max,' says\r\nshe, 'will you forgive me?' 'What!' says I. 'Forgive a murderess?'\r\nsays I. 'No, curse me, never!' 'Your cruelty will kill me,' sobbed she.\r\n'Cruelty be hanged!' says I; 'didn't you draw that beer an hour before\r\ndinner?' She could say nothing to THIS, you know, and I swore that every\r\ntime she did so, I would fling it into her face again. Whereupon\r\nback she flounced to her chamber, where she wept and stormed until\r\nnight-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you forgave her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI DID forgive her, that's positive. You see I had supped at the 'Rose'\r\nalong with Tom Trippet and half-a-dozen pretty fellows; and I had eased\r\na great fat-headed Warwickshire landjunker--what d'ye call him?--squire,\r\nof forty pieces; and I'm dev'lish good-humoured when I've won, and so\r\nCat and I made it up: but I've taught her never to bring me stale beer\r\nagain--ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis conversation will explain, a great deal better than any description\r\nof ours, however eloquent, the state of things as between Count\r\nMaximilian and Mrs. Catherine, and the feelings which they entertained\r\nfor each other. The woman loved him, that was the fact. And, as we have\r\nshown in the previous chapter how John Hayes, a mean-spirited fellow\r\nas ever breathed, in respect of all other passions a pigmy, was in the\r\npassion of love a giant, and followed Mrs. Catherine with a furious\r\nlonging which might seem at the first to be foreign to his nature; in\r\nthe like manner, and playing at cross-purposes, Mrs. Hall had become\r\nsmitten of the Captain; and, as he said truly, only liked him the better\r\nfor the brutality which she received at his hands. For it is my opinion,\r\nmadam, that love is a bodily infirmity, from which humankind can no more\r\nescape than from small-pox; and which attacks every one of us, from the\r\nfirst duke in the Peerage down to Jack Ketch inclusive: which has no\r\nrespect for rank, virtue, or roguery in man, but sets each in his turn\r\nin a fever; which breaks out the deuce knows how or why, and, raging its\r\nappointed time, fills each individual of the one sex with a blind\r\nfury and longing for some one of the other (who may be pure, gentle,\r\nblue-eyed, beautiful, and good; or vile, shrewish, squinting,\r\nhunchbacked, and hideous, according to circumstances and luck); which\r\ndies away, perhaps, in the natural course, if left to have its way,\r\nbut which contradiction causes to rage more furiously than ever. Is not\r\nhistory, from the Trojan war upwards and downwards, full of instances of\r\nsuch strange inexplicable passions? Was not Helen, by the most moderate\r\ncalculation, ninety years of age when she went off with His Royal\r\nHighness Prince Paris of Troy? Was not Madame La Valliere ill-made,\r\nblear-eyed, tallow-complexioned, scraggy, and with hair like tow? Was\r\nnot Wilkes the ugliest, charmingest, most successful man in the world?\r\nSuch instances might be carried out so as to fill a volume; but cui\r\nbono? Love is fate, and not will; its origin not to be explained, its\r\nprogress irresistible: and the best proof of this may be had at Bow\r\nStreet any day, where if you ask any officer of the establishment how\r\nthey take most thieves, he will tell you at the houses of the women.\r\nThey must see the dear creatures though they hang for it; they will\r\nlove, though they have their necks in the halter. And with regard to the\r\nother position, that ill-usage on the part of the man does not destroy\r\nthe affection of the woman, have we not numberless police-reports,\r\nshowing how, when a bystander would beat a husband for beating his wife,\r\nman and wife fall together on the interloper and punish him for his\r\nmeddling?\r\n\r\nThese points, then, being settled to the satisfaction of all parties,\r\nthe reader will not be disposed to question the assertion that Mrs. Hall\r\nhad a real affection for the gallant Count, and grew, as Mr. Brock was\r\npleased to say, like a beefsteak, more tender as she was thumped. Poor\r\nthing, poor thing! his flashy airs and smart looks had overcome her in\r\na single hour; and no more is wanted to plunge into love over head and\r\nears; no more is wanted to make a first love with--and a woman's first\r\nlove lasts FOR EVER (a man's twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth is perhaps\r\nthe best): you can't kill it, do what you will; it takes root, and lives\r\nand even grows, never mind what the soil may be in which it is planted,\r\nor the bitter weather it must bear--often as one has seen a wallflower\r\ngrow--out of a stone.\r\n\r\nIn the first weeks of their union, the Count had at least been liberal\r\nto her: she had a horse and fine clothes, and received abroad some of\r\nthose flattering attentions which she held at such high price. He had,\r\nhowever, some ill-luck at play, or had been forced to pay some bills, or\r\nhad some other satisfactory reason for being poor, and his establishment\r\nwas very speedily diminished. He argued that, as Mrs. Catherine had\r\nbeen accustomed to wait on others all her life, she might now wait upon\r\nherself and him; and when the incident of the beer arose, she had\r\nbeen for some time employed as the Count's housekeeper, with unlimited\r\nsuperintendence over his comfort, his cellar, his linen, and such\r\nmatters as bachelors are delighted to make over to active female hands.\r\nTo do the poor wretch justice, she actually kept the man's menage in the\r\nbest order; nor was there any point of extravagance with which she could\r\nbe charged, except a little extravagance of dress displayed on the\r\nvery few occasions when he condescended to walk abroad with her, and\r\nextravagance of language and passion in the frequent quarrels they\r\nhad together. Perhaps in such a connection as subsisted between this\r\nprecious couple, these faults are inevitable on the part of the woman.\r\nShe must be silly and vain, and will pretty surely therefore be fond of\r\ndress; and she must, disguise it as she will, be perpetually miserable\r\nand brooding over her fall, which will cause her to be violent and\r\nquarrelsome.\r\n\r\nSuch, at least, was Mrs. Hall; and very early did the poor vain\r\nmisguided wretch begin to reap what she had sown.\r\n\r\nFor a man, remorse under these circumstances is perhaps uncommon.\r\nNo stigma affixes on HIM for betraying a woman; no bitter pangs of\r\nmortified vanity; no insulting looks of superiority from his neighbour,\r\nand no sentence of contemptuous banishment is read against him; these\r\nall fall on the tempted, and not on the tempter, who is permitted to\r\ngo free. The chief thing that a man learns after having successfully\r\npractised on a woman is to despise the poor wretch whom he has won.\r\nThe game, in fact, and the glory, such as it is, is all his, and the\r\npunishment alone falls upon her. Consider this, ladies, when charming\r\nyoung gentlemen come to woo you with soft speeches. You have nothing to\r\nwin, except wretchedness, and scorn, and desertion. Consider this, and\r\nbe thankful to your Solomons for telling it.\r\n\r\nIt came to pass, then, that the Count had come to have a perfect\r\ncontempt and indifference for Mrs. Hall;--how should he not for a young\r\nperson who had given herself up to him so easily?--and would have been\r\nquite glad of any opportunity of parting with her. But there was a\r\ncertain lingering shame about the man, which prevented him from saying\r\nat once and abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d and the poor thing did not choose to take\r\nsuch hints as fell out in the course of their conversation and quarrels.\r\nAnd so they kept on together, he treating her with simple insult, and\r\nshe hanging on desperately, by whatever feeble twig she could find, to\r\nthe rock beyond which all was naught, or death, to her.\r\n\r\nWell, after the night with Tom Trippet and the pretty fellows at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRose,\xe2\x80\x9d to which we have heard the Count allude in the conversation\r\njust recorded, Fortune smiled on him a good deal; for the Warwickshire\r\nsquire, who had lost forty pieces on that occasion, insisted on having\r\nhis revenge the night after; when, strange to say, a hundred and fifty\r\nmore found their way into the pouch of his Excellency the Count. Such a\r\nsum as this quite set the young nobleman afloat again, and brought back\r\na pleasing equanimity to his mind, which had been a good deal disturbed\r\nin the former difficult circumstances; and in this, for a little and to\r\na certain extent, poor Cat had the happiness to share. He did not alter\r\nthe style of his establishment, which consisted, as before, of herself\r\nand a small person who acted as scourer, kitchen-wench, and scullion;\r\nMrs. Catherine always putting her hand to the principal pieces of the\r\ndinner; but he treated his mistress with tolerable good-humour; or, to\r\nspeak more correctly, with such bearable brutality as might be expected\r\nfrom a man like him to a woman in her condition. Besides, a certain\r\nevent was about to take place, which not unusually occurs in\r\ncircumstances of this nature, and Mrs. Catherine was expecting soon to\r\nlie in.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, distrusting naturally the strength of his own paternal\r\nfeelings, had kindly endeavoured to provide a parent for the coming\r\ninfant; and to this end had opened a negotiation with our friend Mr.\r\nThomas Bullock, declaring that Mrs. Cat should have a fortune of twenty\r\nguineas, and reminding Tummas of his ancient flame for her: but Mr.\r\nTummas, when this proposition was made to him, declined it, with many\r\noaths, and vowed that he was perfectly satisfied with his present\r\nbachelor condition. In this dilemma, Mr. Brock stepped forward, who\r\ndeclared himself very ready to accept Mrs. Catherine and her fortune:\r\nand might possibly have become the possessor of both, had not Mrs. Cat,\r\nthe moment she heard of the proposed arrangement, with fire in her eyes,\r\nand rage--oh, how bitter!--in her heart, prevented the success of the\r\nmeasure by proceeding incontinently to the first justice of the peace,\r\nand there swearing before his worship who was the father of the coming\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding, which she had expected would cause not a little\r\nindignation on the part of her lord and master, was received by him,\r\nstrangely enough, with considerable good-humour: he swore that the wench\r\nhad served him a good trick, and was rather amused at the anger, the\r\noutbreak of fierce rage and contumely, and the wretched wretched tears\r\nof heartsick desperation, which followed her announcement of this step\r\nto him. For Mr. Brock, she repelled his offer with scorn and loathing,\r\nand treated the notion of a union with Mr. Bullock with yet fiercer\r\ncontempt. Marry him indeed! a workhouse pauper carrying a brown-bess!\r\nShe would have died sooner, she said, or robbed on the highway. And so,\r\nto do her justice, she would: for the little minx was one of the vainest\r\ncreatures in existence, and vanity (as I presume everybody knows)\r\nbecomes THE principle in certain women's hearts--their moral spectacles,\r\ntheir conscience, their meat and drink, their only rule of right and\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Tummas, he, as we have seen, was quite unfriendly to the\r\nproposition as she could be; and the Corporal, with a good deal of\r\ncomical gravity, vowed that, as he could not be satisfied in his\r\ndearest wishes, he would take to drinking for a consolation: which he\r\nstraightway did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Tummas,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Mr. Bullock \xe2\x80\x9csince we CAN'T have the girl\r\nof our hearts, why, hang it, Tummas, let's drink her health!\xe2\x80\x9d To which\r\nBullock had no objection. And so strongly did the disappointment weigh\r\nupon honest Corporal Brock, that even when, after unheard-of quantities\r\nof beer, he could scarcely utter a word, he was seen absolutely to weep,\r\nand, in accents almost unintelligible, to curse his confounded ill-luck\r\nat being deprived, not of a wife, but of a child: he wanted one so, he\r\nsaid, to comfort him in his old age.\r\n\r\nThe time of Mrs. Catherine's couche drew near, arrived, and was gone\r\nthrough safely. She presented to the world a chopping boy, who might\r\nuse, if he liked, the Galgenstein arms with a bar-sinister; and in\r\nher new cares and duties had not so many opportunities as usual of\r\nquarrelling with the Count: who, perhaps, respected her situation, or,\r\nat least, was so properly aware of the necessity of quiet to her, that\r\nhe absented himself from home morning, noon, and night.\r\n\r\nThe Captain had, it must be confessed, turned these continued absences\r\nto a considerable worldly profit, for he played incessantly; and, since\r\nhis first victory over the Warwickshire Squire, Fortune had been so\r\nfavourable to him, that he had at various intervals amassed a sum of\r\nnearly a thousand pounds, which he used to bring home as he won; and\r\nwhich he deposited in a strong iron chest, cunningly screwed down by\r\nhimself under his own bed. This Mrs. Catherine regularly made, and the\r\ntreasure underneath it could be no secret to her. However, the noble\r\nCount kept the key, and bound her by many solemn oaths (that he\r\ndischarged at her himself) not to reveal to any other person the\r\nexistence of the chest and its contents.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in a woman's nature to keep such secrets; and the Captain,\r\nwho left her for days and days, did not reflect that she would seek for\r\nconfidants elsewhere. For want of a female companion, she was compelled\r\nto bestow her sympathies upon Mr. Brock; who, as the Count's\r\ncorporal, was much in his lodgings, and who did manage to survive the\r\ndisappointment which he had experienced by Mrs. Catherine's refusal of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAbout two months after the infant's birth, the Captain, who was annoyed\r\nby its squalling, put it abroad to nurse, and dismissed its attendant.\r\nMrs. Catherine now resumed her household duties, and was, as before,\r\nat once mistress and servant of the establishment. As such, she had the\r\nkeys of the beer, and was pretty sure of the attentions of the Corporal;\r\nwho became, as we have said, in the Count's absence, his lady's chief\r\nfriend and companion. After the manner of ladies, she very speedily\r\nconfided to him all her domestic secrets; the causes of her former\r\ndiscontent; the Count's ill-treatment of her; the wicked names he called\r\nher; the prices that all her gowns had cost her; how he beat her; how\r\nmuch money he won and lost at play; how she had once pawned a coat for\r\nhim; how he had four new ones, laced, and paid for; what was the best\r\nway of cleaning and keeping gold-lace, of making cherry-brandy, pickling\r\nsalmon, etc., etc. Her confidences upon all these subjects used to\r\nfollow each other in rapid succession; and Mr. Brock became, ere long,\r\nquite as well acquainted with the Captain's history for the last year as\r\nthe Count himself:--for he was careless, and forgot things; women\r\nnever do. They chronicle all the lover's small actions, his words, his\r\nheadaches, the dresses he has worn, the things he has liked for dinner\r\non certain days;--all which circumstances commonly are expunged from the\r\nmale brain immediately after they have occurred, but remain fixed with\r\nthe female.\r\n\r\nTo Brock, then, and to Brock only (for she knew no other soul), Mrs. Cat\r\nbreathed, in strictest confidence, the history of the Count's winnings,\r\nand his way of disposing of them; how he kept his money screwed down in\r\nan iron chest in their room; and a very lucky fellow did Brock consider\r\nhis officer for having such a large sum. He and Cat looked at the chest:\r\nit was small, but mighty strong, sure enough, and would defy picklocks\r\nand thieves. Well, if any man deserved money, the Captain did (\xe2\x80\x9cthough\r\nhe might buy me a few yards of that lace I love so,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\r\nCat),--if any man deserved money, he did, for he spent it like a prince,\r\nand his hand was always in his pocket.\r\n\r\nIt must now be stated that Monsieur de Galgenstein had, during Cat's\r\nseclusion, cast his eyes upon a young lady of good fortune, who\r\nfrequented the Assembly at Birmingham, and who was not a little smitten\r\nby his title and person. The \xe2\x80\x9cfour new coats, laced, and paid for,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nCat said, had been purchased, most probably, by his Excellency for the\r\npurpose of dazzling the heiress; and he and the coats had succeeded so\r\nfar as to win from the young woman an actual profession of love, and a\r\npromise of marriage provided Pa would consent. This was obtained,--for\r\nPa was a tradesman; and I suppose every one of my readers has remarked\r\nhow great an effect a title has on the lower classes. Yes, thank Heaven!\r\nthere is about a freeborn Briton a cringing baseness, and lickspittle\r\nawe of rank, which does not exist under any tyranny in Europe, and is\r\nonly to be found here and in America.\r\n\r\nAll these negotiations had been going on quite unknown to Cat; and, as\r\nthe Captain had determined, before two months were out, to fling that\r\nyoung woman on the pave, he was kind to her in the meanwhile: people\r\nalways are when they are swindling you, or meditating an injury against\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl had much too high an opinion of her own charms to suspect\r\nthat the Count could be unfaithful to them, and had no notion of the\r\nplot that was formed against her. But Mr. Brock had: for he had seen\r\nmany times a gilt coach with a pair of fat white horses ambling in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the town, and the Captain on his black steed\r\ncaracolling majestically by its side; and he had remarked a fat, pudgy,\r\npale-haired woman treading heavily down the stairs of the Assembly,\r\nleaning on the Captain's arm: all these Mr. Brock had seen, not without\r\nreflection. Indeed, the Count one day, in great good-humour, had slapped\r\nhim on the shoulder and told him that he was about speedily to purchase\r\na regiment; when, by his great gods, Mr. Brock should have a pair of\r\ncolours. Perhaps this promise occasioned his silence to Mrs. Catherine\r\nhitherto; perhaps he never would have peached at all; and perhaps,\r\ntherefore, this history would never have been written, but for a small\r\ncircumstance which occurred at this period.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you want with that drunken old Corporal always about your\r\nquarters?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trippet to the Count one day, as they sat over their\r\nwine, in the midst of a merry company, at the Captain's rooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cOld Brock? The old thief has been more useful to me\r\nthan many a better man. He is as brave in a row as a lion, as cunning in\r\nintrigue as a fox; he can nose a dun at an inconceivable distance, and\r\nscent out a pretty woman be she behind ever so many stone walls. If a\r\ngentleman wants a good rascal now, I can recommend him. I am going to\r\nreform, you know, and must turn him out of my service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pretty Mrs. Cat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, curse pretty Mrs. Cat! she may go too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the brat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you have parishes, and what not, here in England. Egad! if a\r\ngentleman were called upon to keep all his children, there would be no\r\nliving: no, stap my vitals! Croesus couldn't stand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trippet: \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right; and when a gentleman\r\nmarries, he is bound in honour to give up such low connections as are\r\nuseful when he is a bachelor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; and give them up I will, when the sweet Mrs. Dripping is\r\nmine. As for the girl, you can have her, Tom Trippet, if you take a\r\nfancy to her; and as for the Corporal, he may be handed over to my\r\nsuccessor in Cutts's:--for I will have a regiment to myself, that's poz;\r\nand to take with me such a swindling, pimping, thieving, brandy-faced\r\nrascal as this Brock will never do. Egad! he's a disgrace to the\r\nservice. As it is, I've often a mind to have the superannuated vagabond\r\ndrummed out of the corps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough this resume of Mr. Brock's character and accomplishments\r\nwas very just, it came perhaps with an ill grace from Count Gustavus\r\nAdolphus Maximilian, who had profited by all his qualities, and who\r\ncertainly would never have given this opinion of them had he known that\r\nthe door of his dining-parlour was open, and that the gallant Corporal,\r\nwho was in the passage, could hear every syllable that fell from the\r\nlips of his commanding officer. We shall not say, after the fashion\r\nof the story-books, that Mr. Brock listened with a flashing eye and a\r\ndistended nostril; that his chest heaved tumultuously, and that his\r\nhand fell down mechanically to his side, where it played with the brass\r\nhandle of his sword. Mr. Kean would have gone through most of these\r\nbodily exercises had he been acting the part of a villain enraged and\r\ndisappointed like Corporal Brock; but that gentleman walked away without\r\nany gestures of any kind, and as gently as possible. \xe2\x80\x9cHe'll turn me out\r\nof the regiment, will he?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, quite piano; and then added (con\r\nmolta espressione), \xe2\x80\x9cI'll do for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it is to be remarked how generally, in cases of this nature,\r\ngentlemen stick to their word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. IN WHICH A NARCOTIC IS ADMINISTERED, AND A GREAT DEAL OF\r\nGENTEEL SOCIETY DEPICTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Corporal, who had retreated to the street-door immediately on\r\nhearing the above conversation, returned to the Captain's lodgings\r\nand paid his respects to Mrs. Catherine, he found that lady in high\r\ngood-humour. The Count had been with her, she said, along with a friend\r\nof his, Mr. Trippet; had promised her twelve yards of the lace she\r\ncoveted so much; had vowed that the child should have as much more for\r\na cloak; and had not left her until he had sat with her for an hour,\r\nor more, over a bowl of punch, which he made on purpose for her. Mr.\r\nTrippet stayed too. \xe2\x80\x9cA mighty pleasant man,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9conly not very\r\nwise, and seemingly a good deal in liquor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good deal indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Corporal. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was so tipsy just now that\r\nhe could hardly stand. He and his honour were talking to Nan Fantail in\r\nthe market-place; and she pulled Trippet's wig off, for wanting to kiss\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nasty fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cat, \xe2\x80\x9cto demean himself with such low\r\npeople as Nan Fantail, indeed! Why, upon my conscience now, Corporal, it\r\nwas but an hour ago that Mr. Trippet swore he never saw such a pair of\r\neyes as mine, and would like to cut the Captain's throat for the love of\r\nme. Nan Fantail, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNan's an honest girl, Madam Catherine, and was a great favourite of\r\nthe Captain's before someone else came in his way. No one can say a word\r\nagainst her--not a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, Corporal, who ever did?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cat, rather offended. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nnasty, ugly slut! I wonder what the men can see in her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has got a smart way with her, sure enough; it's what amuses the\r\nmen, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what? You don't mean to say that my Max is fond of her NOW?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Catherine, looking very fierce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; not at all: not of HER;--that is--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot of HER!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed she. \xe2\x80\x9cOf whom, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, psha! nonsense! Of you, my dear, to be sure; who else should he\r\ncare for? And, besides, what business is it of mine?\xe2\x80\x9d And herewith\r\nthe Corporal began whistling, as if he would have no more of the\r\nconversation. But Mrs. Cat was not to be satisfied,--not she,--and\r\ncarried on her cross-questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, look you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Corporal, after parrying many of these,--\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nlook you, I'm an old fool, Catherine, and I must blab. That man has been\r\nthe best friend I ever had, and so I was quiet; but I can't keep it in\r\nany longer,--no, hang me if I can! It's my belief he's acting like a\r\nrascal by you: he deceives you, Catherine; he's a scoundrel, Mrs. Hall,\r\nthat's the truth on't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatherine prayed him to tell all he knew; and he resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants you off his hands; he's sick of you, and so brought here that\r\nfool Tom Trippet, who has taken a fancy to you. He has not the courage\r\nto turn you out of doors like a man; though indoors he can treat you\r\nlike a beast. But I'll tell you what he'll do. In a month he will go to\r\nCoventry, or pretend to go there, on recruiting business. No such thing,\r\nMrs. Hall; he's going on MARRIAGE business; and he'll leave you without\r\na farthing, to starve or to rot, for him. It's all arranged, I tell you:\r\nin a month, you are to be starved into becoming Tom Trippet's\r\nmistress; and his honour is to marry rich Miss Dripping, the\r\ntwenty-thousand-pounder from London; and to purchase a regiment;--and to\r\nget old Brock drummed out of Cutts's too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Corporal, under his\r\nbreath. But he might have spoken out, if he chose; for the poor young\r\nwoman had sunk on the ground in a real honest fit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I should give it her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock as he procured a glass\r\nof water; and, lifting her on to a sofa, sprinkled the same over her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it! how pretty she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Catherine came to herself again, Brock's tone with her was\r\nkind, and almost feeling. Nor did the poor wench herself indulge in\r\nany subsequent shiverings and hysterics, such as usually follow the\r\nfainting-fits of persons of higher degree. She pressed him for further\r\nexplanations, which he gave, and to which she listened with a great deal\r\nof calmness; nor did many tears, sobs, sighs, or exclamations of sorrow\r\nor anger escape from her: only when the Corporal was taking his leave,\r\nand said to her point-blank,--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Catherine, and what do you\r\nintend to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she did not reply a word; but gave a look which made him\r\nexclaim, on leaving the room,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy heavens! the woman means murder! I would not be the Holofernes to\r\nlie by the side of such a Judith as that--not I!\xe2\x80\x9d And he went his way,\r\nimmersed in deep thought. When the Captain returned at night, she did\r\nnot speak to him; and when he swore at her for being sulky, she only\r\nsaid she had a headache, and was dreadfully ill; with which excuse\r\nGustavus Adolphus seemed satisfied, and left her to herself.\r\n\r\nHe saw her the next morning for a moment: he was going a-shooting.\r\n\r\nCatherine had no friend, as is usual in tragedies and romances,--no\r\nmysterious sorceress of her acquaintance to whom she could apply for\r\npoison,--so she went simply to the apothecaries, pretending at each that\r\nshe had a dreadful toothache, and procuring from them as much laudanum\r\nas she thought would suit her purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen she went home again she seemed almost gay. Mr. Brock complimented\r\nher upon the alteration in her appearance; and she was enabled to\r\nreceive the Captain at his return from shooting in such a manner as made\r\nhim remark that she had got rid of her sulks of the morning, and might\r\nsup with them, if she chose to keep her good-humour. The supper was\r\ngot ready, and the gentlemen had the punch-bowl when the cloth was\r\ncleared,--Mrs. Catherine, with her delicate hands, preparing the liquor.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to describe the conversation that took place, or to reckon\r\nthe number of bowls that were emptied; or to tell how Mr. Trippet, who\r\nwas one of the guests, and declined to play at cards when some of the\r\nothers began, chose to remain by Mrs. Catherine's side, and make violent\r\nlove to her. All this might be told, and the account, however faithful,\r\nwould not be very pleasing. No, indeed! And here, though we are only in\r\nthe third chapter of this history, we feel almost sick of the characters\r\nthat appear in it, and the adventures which they are called upon to go\r\nthrough. But how can we help ourselves? The public will hear of nothing\r\nbut rogues; and the only way in which poor authors, who must live, can\r\nact honestly by the public and themselves, is to paint such thieves as\r\nthey are: not, dandy, poetical, rose-water thieves; but real downright\r\nscoundrels, leading scoundrelly lives, drunken, profligate, dissolute,\r\nlow; as scoundrels will be. They don't quote Plato, like Eugene Aram; or\r\nlive like gentlemen, and sing the pleasantest ballads in the world, like\r\njolly Dick Turpin; or prate eternally about \xe2\x80\x9cto kalon,\xe2\x80\x9d[*] like that\r\nprecious canting Maltravers, whom we all of us have read about and\r\npitied; or die whitewashed saints, like poor \xe2\x80\x9cBiss Dadsy\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cOliver\r\nTwist.\xe2\x80\x9d No, my dear madam, you and your daughters have no right to\r\nadmire and sympathise with any such persons, fictitious or real:\r\nyou ought to be made cordially to detest, scorn, loathe, abhor, and\r\nabominate all people of this kidney. Men of genius like those whose\r\nworks we have above alluded to, have no business to make these\r\ncharacters interesting or agreeable; to be feeding your morbid fancies,\r\nor indulging their own, with such monstrous food. For our parts, young\r\nladies, we beg you to bottle up your tears, and not waste a single drop\r\nof them on any one of the heroes or heroines in this history: they\r\nare all rascals, every soul of them, and behave \xe2\x80\x9cas sich.\xe2\x80\x9d Keep your\r\nsympathy for those who deserve it: don't carry it, for preference, to\r\nthe Old Bailey, and grow maudlin over the company assembled there.\r\n\r\n     * Anglicised version of the author's original Greek text.\r\n\r\nJust, then, have the kindness to fancy that the conversation which took\r\nplace over the bowls of punch which Mrs. Catherine prepared, was such\r\nas might be expected to take place where the host was a dissolute,\r\ndare-devil, libertine captain of dragoons, the guests for the most\r\npart of the same class, and the hostess a young woman originally from a\r\ncountry alehouse, and for the present mistress to the entertainer of\r\nthe society. They talked, and they drank, and they grew tipsy; and very\r\nlittle worth hearing occurred during the course of the whole evening.\r\nMr. Brock officiated, half as the servant, half as the companion of the\r\nsociety. Mr. Thomas Trippet made violent love to Mrs. Catherine, while\r\nher lord and master was playing at dice with the other gentlemen: and on\r\nthis night, strange to say, the Captain's fortune seemed to desert him.\r\nThe Warwickshire Squire, from whom he had won so much, had an amazing\r\nrun of good luck. The Captain called perpetually for more drink, and\r\nhigher stakes, and lost almost every throw. Three hundred, four hundred,\r\nsix hundred--all his winnings of the previous months were swallowed up\r\nin the course of a few hours. The Corporal looked on; and, to do him\r\njustice, seemed very grave as, sum by sum, the Squire scored down the\r\nCount's losses on the paper before him.\r\n\r\nMost of the company had taken their hats and staggered off. The Squire\r\nand Mr. Trippet were the only two that remained, the latter still\r\nlingering by Mrs. Catherine's sofa and table; and as she, as we have\r\nstated, had been employed all the evening in mixing the liquor for\r\nthe gamesters, he was at the headquarters of love and drink, and had\r\nswallowed so much of each as hardly to be able to speak.\r\n\r\nThe dice went rattling on; the candles were burning dim, with great long\r\nwicks. Mr. Trippet could hardly see the Captain, and thought, as far as\r\nhis muzzy reason would let him, that the Captain could not see him:\r\nso he rose from his chair as well as he could, and fell down on Mrs.\r\nCatherine's sofa. His eyes were fixed, his face was pale, his jaw hung\r\ndown; and he flung out his arms and said, in a maudlin voice, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\r\nbyoo-oo-oo-tifile Cathrine, I must have a kick-kick-iss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeast!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Catherine, and pushed him away. The drunken wretch\r\nfell off the sofa, and on to the floor, where he stayed; and, after\r\nsnorting out some unintelligible sounds, went to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe dice went rattling on; the candles were burning dim, with great long\r\nwicks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven's the main,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Count. \xe2\x80\x9cFour. Three to two against the\r\ncaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPonies,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Warwickshire Squire.\r\n\r\nRattle, rattle, rattle, rattle, clatter, NINE. Clap, clap, clap, clap,\r\nELEVEN. Clutter, clutter, clutter, clutter: \xe2\x80\x9cSeven it is,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nWarwickshire Squire. \xe2\x80\x9cThat makes eight hundred, Count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne throw for two hundred,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count. \xe2\x80\x9cBut stop! Cat, give us\r\nsome more punch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Cat came forward; she looked a little pale, and her hand trembled\r\nsomewhat. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the punch, Max,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. It was steaming hot, in a\r\nlarge glass. \xe2\x80\x9cDon't drink it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cleave me some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dark it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count, eyeing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's the brandy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here goes! Squire, curse you! here's your health, and bad luck\r\nto you!\xe2\x80\x9d and he gulped off more than half the liquor at a draught. But\r\npresently he put down the glass and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat infernal poison is\r\nthis, Cat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoison!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's no poison. Give me the glass.\xe2\x80\x9d And she pledged\r\nMax, and drank a little of it. \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis good punch, Max, and of my brewing;\r\nI don't think you will ever get any better.\xe2\x80\x9d And she went back to the\r\nsofa again, and sat down, and looked at the players.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock looked at her white face and fixed eyes with a grim kind of\r\ncuriosity. The Count sputtered, and cursed the horrid taste of the punch\r\nstill; but he presently took the box, and made his threatened throw.\r\n\r\nAs before, the Squire beat him; and having booked his winnings, rose\r\nfrom table as well as he might and besought to lead him downstairs;\r\nwhich Mr. Brock did.\r\n\r\nLiquor had evidently stupefied the Count: he sat with his head between\r\nhis hands, muttering wildly about ill-luck, seven's the main, bad punch,\r\nand so on. The street-door banged to; and the steps of Brock and the\r\nSquire were heard, until they could be heard no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMax,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; but he did not answer. \xe2\x80\x9cMax,\xe2\x80\x9d said she again, laying\r\nher hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse you,\xe2\x80\x9d said that gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep off, and don't be laying your\r\npaws upon me. Go to bed, you jade, or to ----, for what I care; and give me\r\nfirst some more punch--a gallon more punch, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, by the curses at the commencement of this little speech,\r\nand the request contained at the end of it, showed that his losses vexed\r\nhim, and that he was anxious to forget them temporarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Max!\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered Mrs. Cat, \xe2\x80\x9cyou--don't--want any more punch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't! Shan't I be drunk in my own house, you cursed whimpering jade,\r\nyou? Get out!\xe2\x80\x9d and with this the Captain proceeded to administer a blow\r\nupon Mrs. Catherine's cheek.\r\n\r\nContrary to her custom, she did not avenge it, or seek to do so, as\r\non the many former occasions when disputes of this nature had arisen\r\nbetween the Count and her; but now Mrs. Catherine fell on her knees and,\r\nclasping her hands and looking pitifully in the Count's face, cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Count, forgive me, forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive you! What for? Because I slapped your face? Ha, ha! I'll\r\nforgive you again, if you don't mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, wringing her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't that. Max,\r\ndear Max, will you forgive me? It isn't the blow--I don't mind that;\r\nit's--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's what, you--maudlin fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIT'S THE PUNCH!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Count, who was more than half seas over, here assumed an air of much\r\ntipsy gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cThe punch! No, I never will forgive you that last glass\r\nof punch. Of all the foul, beastly drinks I ever tasted, that was the\r\nworst. No, I never will forgive you that punch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it isn't that, it isn't that!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it is that,--you! That punch, I say that punch was no better\r\nthan paw--aw-oison.\xe2\x80\x9d And here the Count's head sank back, and he fell to\r\nsnore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIT WAS POISON!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWHAT!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed he, waking up at once, and spurning her away from him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you infernal murderess, have you killed me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Max!--don't kill me, Max! It was laudanum--indeed it was. You were\r\ngoing to be married, and I was furious, and I went and got--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, you fiend,\xe2\x80\x9d roared out the Count; and with more\r\npresence of mind than politeness, he flung the remainder of the liquor\r\n(and, indeed, the glass with it) at the head of Mrs. Catherine. But the\r\npoisoned chalice missed its mark, and fell right on the nose of Mr. Tom\r\nTrippet, who was left asleep and unobserved under the table.\r\n\r\nBleeding, staggering, swearing, indeed a ghastly sight, up sprang Mr.\r\nTrippet, and drew his rapier. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cnever say die! What's\r\nthe row? I'm ready for a dozen of you.\xe2\x80\x9d And he made many blind and\r\nfurious passes about the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse you, we'll die together!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Count, as he too pulled out\r\nhis toledo, and sprang at Mrs. Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp! murder! thieves!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked she. \xe2\x80\x9cSave me, Mr. Trippet, save me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and she placed that gentleman between herself and the Count, and then\r\nmade for the door of the bedroom, and gained it, and bolted it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the way, Trippet,\xe2\x80\x9d roared the Count--\xe2\x80\x9cout of the way, you\r\ndrunken beast! I'll murder her, I will--I'll have the devil's life.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhere he gave a swinging cut at Mr. Trippet's sword: it sent the weapon\r\nwhirling clean out of his hand, and through a window into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my life, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trippet: \xe2\x80\x9cI'm drunk, but I'm a man, and,\r\ndamme! will never say die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't want your life, you stupid fool. Hark you, Trippet, wake and\r\nbe sober, if you can. That woman has heard of my marriage with Miss\r\nDripping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty thousand pound,\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Trippet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been jealous, I tell you, and POISONED us. She has put laudanum\r\ninto the punch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, in MY punch?\xe2\x80\x9d said Trippet, growing quite sober and losing his\r\ncourage. \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord! O Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't stand howling there, but run for a doctor; 'tis our only chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And away ran Mr. Trippet, as if the deuce were at his heels.\r\n\r\nThe Count had forgotten his murderous intentions regarding his mistress,\r\nor had deferred them at least, under the consciousness of his own\r\npressing danger. And it must be said, in the praise of a man who had\r\nfought for and against Marlborough and Tallard, that his courage in this\r\ntrying and novel predicament never for a moment deserted him, but that\r\nhe showed the greatest daring, as well as ingenuity, in meeting and\r\naverting the danger. He flew to the sideboard, where were the relics of\r\na supper, and seizing the mustard and salt pots, and a bottle of oil,\r\nhe emptied them all into a jug, into which he further poured a vast\r\nquantity of hot water. This pleasing mixture he then, without a moment's\r\nhesitation, placed to his lips, and swallowed as much of it as nature\r\nwould allow him. But when he had imbibed about a quart, the anticipated\r\neffect was produced, and he was enabled, by the power of this ingenious\r\nextemporaneous emetic, to get rid of much of the poison which Mrs.\r\nCatherine had administered to him.\r\n\r\nHe was employed in these efforts when the doctor entered, along with\r\nMr. Brock and Mr. Trippet; who was not a little pleased to hear that\r\nthe poisoned punch had not in all probability been given to him. He\r\nwas recommended to take some of the Count's mixture, as a precautionary\r\nmeasure; but this he refused, and retired home, leaving the Count under\r\ncharge of the physician and his faithful corporal.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say what further remedies were employed by\r\nthem to restore the Captain to health; but after some time the doctor,\r\npronouncing that the danger was, he hoped, averted, recommended that his\r\npatient should be put to bed, and that somebody should sit by him; which\r\nBrock promised to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she-devil will murder me, if you don't,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped the poor Count.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must turn her out of the bedroom; or break open the door, if she\r\nrefuses to let you in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this step was found to be necessary; for, after shouting many\r\ntimes, and in vain, Mr. Brock found a small iron bar (indeed, he had the\r\ninstrument for many days in his pocket), and forced the lock. The room\r\nwas empty, the window was open: the pretty barmaid of the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\nfled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count--\xe2\x80\x9cis the chest safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Corporal flew to the bed, under which it was screwed, and looked,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt IS safe, thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d The window was closed. The\r\nCaptain, who was too weak to stand without help, was undressed and put\r\nto bed. The Corporal sat down by his side; slumber stole over the eyes\r\nof the patient; and his wakeful nurse marked with satisfaction the\r\nprogress of the beneficent restorer of health.\r\n\r\nWhen the Captain awoke, as he did some time afterwards, he found, very\r\nmuch to his surprise, that a gag had been placed in his mouth, and that\r\nthe Corporal was in the act of wheeling his bed to another part of the\r\nroom. He attempted to move, and gave utterance to such unintelligible\r\nsounds as could issue through a silk handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your honour stirs or cries out in the least, I will cut your\r\nhonour's throat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Corporal.\r\n\r\nAnd then, having recourse to his iron bar (the reader will now see why\r\nhe was provided with such an implement, for he had been meditating this\r\ncoup for some days), he proceeded first to attempt to burst the lock of\r\nthe little iron chest in which the Count kept his treasure, and, failing\r\nin this, to unscrew it from the ground; which operation he performed\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen rogues fall out there's the\r\ndeuce to pay. You'll have me drummed out of the regiment, will you?\r\nI'm going to leave it of my own accord, look you, and to live like a\r\ngentleman for the rest of my days. Schlafen Sie wohl, noble Captain: bon\r\nrepos. The Squire will be with you pretty early in the morning, to ask\r\nfor the money you owe him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these sarcastic observations Mr. Brock departed; not by the window,\r\nas Mrs. Catherine had done, but by the door, quietly, and so into\r\nthe street. And when, the next morning, the doctor came to visit his\r\npatient, he brought with him a story how, at the dead of night, Mr.\r\nBrock had roused the ostler at the stables where the Captain's horses\r\nwere kept--had told him that Mrs. Catherine had poisoned the Count, and\r\nhad run off with a thousand pounds; and how he and all lovers of justice\r\nought to scour the country in pursuit of the criminal. For this end Mr.\r\nBrock mounted the Count's best horse--that very animal on which he\r\nhad carried away Mrs. Catherine: and thus, on a single night, Count\r\nMaximilian had lost his mistress, his money, his horse, his corporal,\r\nand was very near losing his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. IN WHICH MRS. CATHERINE BECOMES AN HONEST WOMAN AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this woeful plight, moneyless, wifeless, horseless, corporalless,\r\nwith a gag in his mouth and a rope round his body, are we compelled to\r\nleave the gallant Galgenstein, until his friends and the progress of\r\nthis history shall deliver him from his durance. Mr. Brock's adventures\r\non the Captain's horse must likewise be pretermitted; for it is our\r\nbusiness to follow Mrs. Catherine through the window by which she made\r\nher escape, and among the various chances that befell her.\r\n\r\nShe had one cause to congratulate herself,--that she had not her baby at\r\nher back; for the infant was safely housed under the care of a nurse,\r\nto whom the Captain was answerable. Beyond this her prospects were but\r\ndismal: no home to fly to, but a few shillings in her pocket, and a\r\nwhole heap of injuries and dark revengeful thoughts in her bosom: it was\r\na sad task to her to look either backwards or forwards. Whither was she\r\nto fly? How to live? What good chance was to befriend her? There was an\r\nangel watching over the steps of Mrs. Cat--not a good one, I think, but\r\none of those from that unnameable place, who have their many subjects\r\nhere on earth, and often are pleased to extricate them from worse\r\nperplexities.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cat, now, had not committed murder, but as bad as murder; and as\r\nshe felt not the smallest repentance in her heart--as she had, in\r\nthe course of her life and connection with the Captain, performed and\r\ngloried in a number of wicked coquetries, idlenesses, vanities, lies,\r\nfits of anger, slanders, foul abuses, and what not--she was fairly bound\r\nover to this dark angel whom we have alluded to; and he dealt with her,\r\nand aided her, as one of his own children.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that, in this strait, he appeared to her in the\r\nlikeness of a gentleman in black, and made her sign her name in blood\r\nto a document conveying over to him her soul, in exchange for certain\r\nconditions to be performed by him. Such diabolical bargains have always\r\nappeared to me unworthy of the astute personage who is supposed to be\r\none of the parties to them; and who would scarcely be fool enough to pay\r\ndearly for that which he can have in a few years for nothing. It is not,\r\nthen, to be supposed that a demon of darkness appeared to Mrs. Cat,\r\nand led her into a flaming chariot harnessed by dragons, and careering\r\nthrough air at the rate of a thousand leagues a minute. No such thing;\r\nthe vehicle that was sent to aid her was one of a much more vulgar\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cLiverpool carryvan,\xe2\x80\x9d then, which in the year 1706 used to perform\r\nthe journey between London and that place in ten days, left Birmingham\r\nabout an hour after Mrs. Catherine had quitted that town; and as she sat\r\nweeping on a hillside, and plunged in bitter meditation, the lumbering,\r\njingling vehicle overtook her. The coachman was marching by the side of\r\nhis horses, and encouraging them to maintain their pace of two miles an\r\nhour; the passengers had some of them left the vehicle, in order to\r\nwalk up the hill; and the carriage had arrived at the top of it, and,\r\nmeditating a brisk trot down the declivity, waited there until the\r\nlagging passengers should arrive: when Jehu, casting a good-natured\r\nglance upon Mrs. Catherine, asked the pretty maid whence she was come,\r\nand whether she would like a ride in his carriage. To the latter of\r\nwhich questions Mrs. Catherine replied truly yes; to the former, her\r\nanswer was that she had come from Stratford; whereas, as we very well\r\nknow, she had lately quitted Birmingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thee seen a woman pass this way, on a black horse, with a large\r\nbag of goold over the saddle?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jehu, preparing to mount upon the\r\nroof of his coach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor a trooper on another horse after her--no? Well, there be a mortal\r\nrow down Birmingham way about sich a one. She have killed, they say,\r\nnine gentlemen at supper, and have strangled a German prince in bed.\r\nShe have robbed him of twenty thousand guineas, and have rode away on a\r\nblack horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat can't be I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cat, naively, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have but three\r\nshillings and a groat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it can't be thee, truly, for where's your bag of goold? and,\r\nbesides, thee hast got too pretty a face to do such wicked things as to\r\nkill nine gentlemen and strangle a German prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, coachman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cat, blushing archly-- \xe2\x80\x9cLaw, coachman, DO you\r\nthink so?\xe2\x80\x9d The girl would have been pleased with a compliment even on\r\nher way to be hanged; and the parley ended by Mrs. Catherine stepping\r\ninto the carriage, where there was room for eight people at least, and\r\nwhere two or three individuals had already taken their places. For these\r\nMrs. Catherine had in the first place to make a story, which she did;\r\nand a very glib one for a person of her years and education. Being asked\r\nwhither she was bound, and how she came to be alone of a morning sitting\r\nby a road-side, she invented a neat history suitable to the occasion,\r\nwhich elicited much interest from her fellow-passengers: one in\r\nparticular, a young man, who had caught a glimpse of her face under her\r\nhood, was very tender in his attentions to her.\r\n\r\nBut whether it was that she had been too much fatigued by the\r\noccurrences of the past day and sleepless night, or whether the little\r\nlaudanum which she had drunk a few hours previously now began to act\r\nupon her, certain it is that Mrs. Cat now suddenly grew sick, feverish,\r\nand extraordinarily sleepy; and in this state she continued for\r\nmany hours, to the pity of all her fellow-travellers. At length the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccarryvan\xe2\x80\x9d reached the inn, where horses and passengers were accustomed\r\nto rest for a few hours, and to dine; and Mrs. Catherine was somewhat\r\nawakened by the stir of the passengers, and the friendly voice of the\r\ninn-servant welcoming them to dinner. The gentleman who had been smitten\r\nby her beauty now urged her very politely to descend; which, taking the\r\nprotection of his arm, she accordingly did.\r\n\r\nHe made some very gallant speeches to her as she stepped out; and\r\nshe must have been very much occupied by them, or wrapt up in her own\r\nthoughts, or stupefied by sleep, fever, and opium, for she did not take\r\nany heed of the place into which she was going: which, had she done,\r\nshe would probably have preferred remaining in the coach, dinnerless and\r\nill. Indeed, the inn into which she was about to make her entrance was\r\nno other than the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle,\xe2\x80\x9d from which she set forth at the commencement\r\nof this history; and which then, as now, was kept by her relative, the\r\nthrifty Mrs. Score. That good landlady, seeing a lady, in a smart hood\r\nand cloak, leaning, as if faint, upon the arm of a gentleman of good\r\nappearance, concluded them to be man and wife, and folks of quality too;\r\nand with much discrimination, as well as sympathy, led them through the\r\npublic kitchen to her own private parlour, or bar, where she handed the\r\nlady an armchair, and asked what she would like to drink. By this time,\r\nand indeed at the very moment she heard her aunt's voice, Mrs. Catherine\r\nwas aware of her situation; and when her companion retired, and the\r\nlandlady, with much officiousness, insisted on removing her hood, she\r\nwas quite prepared for the screech of surprise which Mrs. Score gave on\r\ndropping it, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, law bless us, it's our Catherine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm very ill, and tired, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cat; \xe2\x80\x9cand would give the world for\r\na few hours' sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few hours and welcome, my love, and a sack-posset too. You do look\r\nsadly tired and poorly, sure enough. Ah, Cat, Cat! you great ladies\r\nare sad rakes, I do believe. I wager now, that with all your balls, and\r\ncarriages, and fine clothes, you are neither so happy nor so well as\r\nwhen you lived with your poor old aunt, who used to love you so.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nwith these gentle words, and an embrace or two, which Mrs. Catherine\r\nwondered at, and permitted, she was conducted to that very bed which the\r\nCount had occupied a year previously, and undressed, and laid in it, and\r\naffectionately tucked up by her aunt, who marvelled at the fineness of\r\nher clothes, as she removed them piece by piece; and when she saw\r\nthat in Mrs. Catherine's pocket there was only the sum of three and\r\nfourpence, said, archly, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no need of money, for the Captain\r\ntook care of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Cat did not undeceive her; and deceived Mrs. Score certainly\r\nwas,--for she imagined the well-dressed gentleman who led Cat from the\r\ncarriage was no other than the Count; and, as she had heard, from time\r\nto time, exaggerated reports of the splendour of the establishment which\r\nhe kept up, she was induced to look upon her niece with the very highest\r\nrespect, and to treat her as if she were a fine lady. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so she IS\r\na fine lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Score had said months ago, when some of these\r\nflattering stories reached her, and she had overcome her first fury at\r\nCatherine's elopement. \xe2\x80\x9cThe girl was very cruel to leave me; but we must\r\nrecollect that she is as good as married to a nobleman, and must all\r\nforget and forgive, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech had been made to Doctor Dobbs, who was in the habit of\r\ntaking a pipe and a tankard at the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle,\xe2\x80\x9d and it had been roundly\r\nreprobated by the worthy divine; who told Mrs. Score, that the crime\r\nof Catherine was only the more heinous, if it had been committed from\r\ninterested motives; and protested that, were she a princess, he would\r\nnever speak to her again. Mrs. Score thought and pronounced the Doctor's\r\nopinion to be very bigoted; indeed, she was one of those persons who\r\nhave a marvellous respect for prosperity, and a corresponding scorn for\r\nill-fortune. When, therefore, she returned to the public room, she\r\nwent graciously to the gentleman who had led Mrs. Catherine from the\r\ncarriage, and with a knowing curtsey welcomed him to the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle;\xe2\x80\x9d told\r\nhim that his lady would not come to dinner, but bade her say, with her\r\nbest love to his Lordship, that the ride had fatigued her, and that she\r\nwould lie in bed for an hour or two.\r\n\r\nThis speech was received with much wonder by his Lordship; who was,\r\nindeed, no other than a Liverpool tailor going to London to learn\r\nfashions; but he only smiled, and did not undeceive the landlady, who\r\nherself went off, smilingly, to bustle about dinner.\r\n\r\nThe two or three hours allotted to that meal by the liberal coachmasters\r\nof those days passed away, and Mr. Coachman, declaring that his horses\r\nwere now rested enough, and that they had twelve miles to ride, put the\r\nsteeds to, and summoned the passengers. Mrs. Score, who had seen with\r\nmuch satisfaction that her niece was really ill, and her fever more\r\nviolent, and hoped to have her for many days an inmate in her house, now\r\ncame forward, and casting upon the Liverpool tailor a look of profound\r\nbut respectful melancholy, said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord (for I recollect your Lordship\r\nquite well), the lady upstairs is so ill, that it would be a sin to move\r\nher: had I not better tell coachman to take down your Lordship's trunks,\r\nand the lady's, and make you a bed in the next room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery much to her surprise, this proposition was received with a roar\r\nof laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the person addressed, \xe2\x80\x9cI'm not a lord, but\r\na tailor and draper; and as for that young woman, before to-day I never\r\nset eyes on her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWHAT!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed out Mrs. Score. \xe2\x80\x9cAre not you the Count? Do you mean to\r\nsay that you a'n't Cat's--? DO you mean to say that you didn't order her\r\nbed, and that you won't pay this here little bill?\xe2\x80\x9d And with this she\r\nproduced a document, by which the Count's lady was made her debtor in a\r\nsum of half-a-guinea.\r\n\r\nThese passionate words excited more and more laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cPay it, my\r\nLord,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coachman; \xe2\x80\x9cand then come along, for time presses.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOur\r\nrespects to her Ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d said one passenger. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her my Lord can't\r\nwait,\xe2\x80\x9d said another; and with much merriment one and all quitted the\r\nhotel, entered the coach, and rattled off.\r\n\r\nDumb--pale with terror and rage--bill in hand, Mrs. Score had followed\r\nthe company; but when the coach disappeared, her senses returned. Back\r\nshe flew into the inn, overturning the ostler, not deigning to answer\r\nDoctor Dobbs (who, from behind soft tobacco-fumes, mildly asked the\r\nreason of her disturbance), and, bounding upstairs like a fury, she\r\nrushed into the room where Catherine lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madam!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in her highest key, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you mean that you have\r\ncome into this here house to swindle me? Do you dare for to come with\r\nyour airs here, and call yourself a nobleman's lady, and sleep in the\r\nbest bed, when you're no better nor a common tramper? I'll thank you,\r\nma'am, to get out, ma'am. I'll have no sick paupers in this house,\r\nma'am. You know your way to the workhouse, ma'am, and there I'll trouble\r\nyou for to go.\xe2\x80\x9d And here Mrs. Score proceeded quickly to pull off the\r\nbedclothes; and poor Cat arose, shivering with fright and fever.\r\n\r\nShe had no spirit to answer, as she would have done the day before, when\r\nan oath from any human being would have brought half-a-dozen from her in\r\nreturn; or a knife, or a plate, or a leg of mutton, if such had been to\r\nher hand. She had no spirit left for such repartees; but in reply to the\r\nabove words of Mrs. Score, and a great many more of the same kind--which\r\nare not necessary for our history, but which that lady uttered with\r\ninconceivable shrillness and volubility, the poor wench could say\r\nlittle,--only sob and shiver, and gather up the clothes again, crying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, aunt, don't speak unkind to me! I'm very unhappy, and very ill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIll, you strumpet! ill, be hanged! Ill is as ill does; and if you are\r\nill, it's only what you merit. Get out! dress yourself--tramp! Get to\r\nthe workhouse, and don't come to cheat me any more! Dress yourself--do\r\nyou hear? Satin petticoat forsooth, and lace to her smock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor, wretched, chattering, burning, shivering Catherine huddled on her\r\nclothes as well she might: she seemed hardly to know or see what she was\r\ndoing, and did not reply a single word to the many that the landlady let\r\nfall. Cat tottered down the narrow stairs, and through the kitchen, and\r\nto the door; which she caught hold of, and paused awhile, and looked\r\ninto Mrs. Score's face, as for one more chance. \xe2\x80\x9cGet out, you nasty\r\ntrull!\xe2\x80\x9d said that lady, sternly, with arms akimbo; and poor Catherine,\r\nwith a most piteous scream and outgush of tears, let go of the door-post\r\nand staggered away into the road.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no--yes--no--it is poor Catherine Hall, as I live!\xe2\x80\x9d said somebody,\r\nstarting up, shoving aside Mrs. Score very rudely, and running into\r\nthe road, wig off and pipe in hand. It was honest Doctor Dobbs; and\r\nthe result of his interview with Mrs. Cat was, that he gave up for ever\r\nsmoking his pipe at the \xe2\x80\x9cBugle;\xe2\x80\x9d and that she lay sick of a fever for\r\nsome weeks in his house.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nOver this part of Mrs. Cat's history we shall be as brief as possible;\r\nfor, to tell the truth, nothing immoral occurred during her whole stay\r\nat the good Doctor's house; and we are not going to insult the reader\r\nby offering him silly pictures of piety, cheerfulness, good sense, and\r\nsimplicity; which are milk-and-water virtues after all, and have no\r\nrelish with them like a good strong vice, highly peppered. Well, to be\r\nshort: Doctor Dobbs, though a profound theologian, was a very simple\r\ngentleman; and before Mrs. Cat had been a month in the house, he had\r\nlearned to look upon her as one of the most injured and repentant\r\ncharacters in the world; and had, with Mrs. Dobbs, resolved many plans\r\nfor the future welfare of the young Magdalen. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was but sixteen, my\r\nlove, recollect,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cshe was carried off, not by her own\r\nwish either. The Count swore he would marry her; and, though she did not\r\nleave him until that monster tried to poison her, yet think what a\r\nfine Christian spirit the poor girl has shown! she forgives him as\r\nheartily--more heartily, I am sure, than I do Mrs. Score for turning her\r\nadrift in that wicked way.\xe2\x80\x9d The reader will perceive some difference in\r\nthe Doctor's statement and ours, which we assure him is the true one;\r\nbut the fact is, the honest rector had had his tale from Mrs. Cat, and\r\nit was not in his nature to doubt, if she had told him a history ten\r\ntimes more wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentleman and his wife then laid their heads together; and,\r\nrecollecting something of John Hayes's former attachment to Mrs. Cat,\r\nthought that it might be advantageously renewed, should Hayes be still\r\nconstant. Having very adroitly sounded Catherine (so adroitly, indeed,\r\nas to ask her \xe2\x80\x9cwhether she would like to marry John Hayes?\xe2\x80\x9d), that young\r\nwoman had replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. She had loved John Hayes--he had been her early,\r\nonly love; but she was fallen now, and not good enough for him.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthis made the Dobbs family admire her more and more, and cast about for\r\nmeans to bring the marriage to pass.\r\n\r\nHayes was away from the village when Mrs. Cat had arrived there; but he\r\ndid not fail to hear of her illness, and how her aunt had deserted her,\r\nand the good Doctor taken her in. The worthy Doctor himself met Mr.\r\nHayes on the green; and, telling him that some repairs were wanting in\r\nhis kitchen begged him to step in and examine them. Hayes first said no,\r\nplump, and then no, gently; and then pished, and then psha'd; and then,\r\ntrembling very much, went in: and there sat Mrs. Catherine, trembling\r\nvery much too.\r\n\r\nWhat passed between them? If your Ladyship is anxious to know, think of\r\nthat morning when Sir John himself popped the question. Could there be\r\nanything more stupid than the conversation which took place? Such stuff\r\nis not worth repeating: no, not when uttered by people in the very\r\ngenteelest of company; as for the amorous dialogue of a carpenter and\r\nan ex-barmaid, it is worse still. Suffice it to say, that Mr. Hayes, who\r\nhad had a year to recover from his passion, and had, to all appearances,\r\nquelled it, was over head and ears again the very moment he saw Mrs.\r\nCat, and had all his work to do again.\r\n\r\nWhether the Doctor knew what was going on, I can't say; but this matter\r\nis certain, that every evening Hayes was now in the rectory kitchen, or\r\nelse walking abroad with Mrs. Catherine: and whether she ran away with\r\nhim, or he with her, I shall not make it my business to inquire; but\r\ncertainly at the end of three months (which must be crowded up into this\r\none little sentence), another elopement took place in the village. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould have prevented it, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Dobbs--whereat his\r\nwife smiled; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the young people kept the matter a secret from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And so he would, had he known it; but though Mrs. Dobbs had made\r\nseveral attempts to acquaint him with the precise hour and method of the\r\nintended elopement, he peremptorily ordered her to hold her tongue. The\r\nfact is, that the matter had been discussed by the rector's lady many\r\ntimes. \xe2\x80\x9cYoung Hayes,\xe2\x80\x9d would she say \xe2\x80\x9chas a pretty little fortune and\r\ntrade of his own; he is an only son, and may marry as he likes; and,\r\nthough not specially handsome, generous, or amiable, has an undeniable\r\nlove for Cat (who, you know, must not be particular), and the sooner she\r\nmarries him, I think, the better. They can't be married at our\r\nchurch you know, and--\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cif they are married\r\nelsewhere, I can't help it, and know nothing about it, look you.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nupon this hint the elopement took place: which, indeed, was peaceably\r\nperformed early one Sunday morning about a month after; Mrs. Hall\r\ngetting behind Mr. Hayes on a pillion, and all the children of the\r\nparsonage giggling behind the window-blinds to see the pair go off.\r\n\r\nDuring this month Mr. Hayes had caused the banns to be published at the\r\ntown of Worcester; judging rightly that in a great town they would cause\r\nno such remark as in a solitary village, and thither he conducted his\r\nlady. O ill-starred John Hayes! whither do the dark Fates lead you? O\r\nfoolish Doctor Dobbs, to forget that young people ought to honour their\r\nparents, and to yield to silly Mrs. Dobbs's ardent propensity for making\r\nmatches!\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nThe London Gazette of the 1st April, 1706, contains a proclamation\r\nby the Queen for putting into execution an Act of Parliament for the\r\nencouragement and increase of seamen, and for the better and speedier\r\nmanning of Her Majesty's fleet, which authorises all justices to issue\r\nwarrants to constables, petty constables, headboroughs, and tything-men,\r\nto enter and, if need be, to break open the doors of any houses where\r\nthey shall believe deserting seamen to be; and for the further increase\r\nand encouragement of the navy, to take able-bodied landsmen when seamen\r\nfail. This Act, which occupies four columns of the Gazette, and another\r\nof similar length and meaning for pressing men into the army, need\r\nnot be quoted at length here; but caused a mighty stir throughout the\r\nkingdom at the time when it was in force.\r\n\r\nAs one has seen or heard, after the march of a great army, a number of\r\nrogues and loose characters bring up the rear; in like manner, at\r\nthe tail of a great measure of State, follow many roguish personal\r\ninterests, which are protected by the main body. The great measure of\r\nReform, for instance, carried along with it much private jobbing and\r\nswindling--as could be shown were we not inclined to deal mildly with\r\nthe Whigs; and this Enlistment Act, which, in order to maintain the\r\nBritish glories in Flanders, dealt most cruelly with the British people\r\nin England (it is not the first time that a man has been pinched at home\r\nto make a fine appearance abroad), created a great company of rascals\r\nand informers throughout the land, who lived upon it; or upon extortion\r\nfrom those who were subject to it, or not being subject to it were\r\nfrightened into the belief that they were.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hayes and his lady had gone through the marriage ceremony at\r\nWorcester, the former, concluding that at such a place lodging and food\r\nmight be procured at a cheaper rate, looked about carefully for the\r\nmeanest public-house in the town, where he might deposit his bride.\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen of this inn, a party of men were drinking; and, as\r\nMrs. Hayes declined, with a proper sense of her superiority, to eat in\r\ncompany with such low fellows, the landlady showed her and her husband\r\nto an inner apartment, where they might be served in private.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen party seemed, indeed, not such as a lady would choose to\r\njoin. There was one huge lanky fellow, that looked like a soldier,\r\nand had a halberd; another was habited in a sailor's costume, with a\r\nfascinating patch over one eye; and a third, who seemed the leader\r\nof the gang, was a stout man in a sailor's frock and a horseman's\r\njack-boots, whom one might fancy, if he were anything, to be a\r\nhorse-marine.\r\n\r\nOf one of these worthies, Mrs. Hayes thought she knew the figure and\r\nvoice; and she found her conjectures were true, when, all of sudden,\r\nthree people, without \xe2\x80\x9cWith your leave,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBy your leave,\xe2\x80\x9d burst into\r\nthe room, into which she and her spouse had retired. At their head was\r\nno other than her old friend, Mr. Peter Brock; he had his sword drawn,\r\nand his finger to his lips, enjoining silence, as it were, to Mrs.\r\nCatherine. He with the patch on his eye seized incontinently on Mr.\r\nHayes; the tall man with the halberd kept the door; two or three heroes\r\nsupported the one-eyed man; who, with a loud voice, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cDown\r\nwith your arms--no resistance! you are my prisoner, in the Queen's\r\nname!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here, at this lock, we shall leave the whole company until the next\r\nchapter; which may possibly explain what they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. CONTAINS MR. BROCK'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY, AND OTHER MATTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't sure believe these men?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hayes, as soon as the\r\nfirst alarm caused by the irruption of Mr. Brock and his companions had\r\nsubsided. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are no magistrate's men: it is but a trick to rob you\r\nof your money, John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never give up a farthing of it!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Hayes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Catherine, \xe2\x80\x9cI know, for all his drawn\r\nsword and fierce looks; his name is---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWood, madam, at your service!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cI am follower to Mr.\r\nJustice Gobble, of this town: a'n't I, Tim?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock to the tall\r\nhalberdman who was keeping the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim, archly; \xe2\x80\x9cwe're all followers of his honour\r\nJustice Gobble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d said the one-eyed man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the man in the nightcap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, madam, you're satisfied NOW?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Brock, alias\r\nWood. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can't deny the testimony of gentlemen like these; and our\r\ncommission is to apprehend all able-bodied male persons who can give\r\nno good account of themselves, and enrol them in the service of Her\r\nMajesty. Look at this Mr. Hayes\xe2\x80\x9d (who stood trembling in his shoes).\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan there be a bolder, properer, straighter gentleman? We'll have him\r\nfor a grenadier before the day's over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake heart, John--don't be frightened. Psha! I tell you I know the man\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried out Mrs. Hayes: \xe2\x80\x9che is only here to extort money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for that matter, I DO think I recollect the lady. Let me see; where\r\nwas it? At Birmingham, I think,--ay, at Birmingham,--about the time when\r\nthey tried to murder Count Gal--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d here cried Madam Hayes, dropping her voice at once from a\r\ntone of scorn to one of gentlest entreaty, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is it you want with my\r\nhusband? I know not, indeed, if ever I saw you before. For what do you\r\nseize him? How much will you take to release him, and let us go? Name\r\nthe sum; he is rich, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRICH, Catherine!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hayes. \xe2\x80\x9cRich!--O heavens! Sir, I have nothing\r\nbut my hands to support me: I am a poor carpenter, sir, working under my\r\nfather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can give twenty guineas to be free; I know he can!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have but a guinea to carry me home,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed out Hayes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have twenty at home, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cGive these brave\r\ngentlemen a writing to your mother, and she will pay; and you will let\r\nus free then, gentlemen--won't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the money's paid, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the leader, Mr. Brock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in course,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the tall man with the halberd. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat's a\r\nthrifling detintion, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, addressing Hayes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe'll\r\namuse you in your absence, and drink to the health of your pretty wife\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis promise, to do the halberdier justice, he fulfilled. He called upon\r\nthe landlady to produce the desired liquor; and when Mr. Hayes flung\r\nhimself at that lady's feet, demanding succour from her, and asking\r\nwhether there was no law in the land--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's no law at the 'Three Rooks' except THIS!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock\r\nin reply, holding up a horse-pistol. To which the hostess, grinning,\r\nassented, and silently went her way.\r\n\r\nAfter some further solicitations, John Hayes drew out the necessary\r\nletter to his father, stating that he was pressed, and would not be set\r\nfree under a sum of twenty guineas; and that it would be of no use\r\nto detain the bearer of the letter, inasmuch as the gentlemen who had\r\npossession of him vowed that they would murder him should any harm\r\nbefall their comrade. As a further proof of the authenticity of the\r\nletter, a token was added: a ring that Hayes wore, and that his mother\r\nhad given him.\r\n\r\nThe missives were, after some consultation, entrusted to the care of the\r\ntall halberdier, who seemed to rank as second in command of the\r\nforces that marched under Corporal Brock. This gentleman was called\r\nindifferently Ensign, Mr., or even Captain Macshane; his intimates\r\noccasionally in sport called him Nosey, from the prominence of that\r\nfeature in his countenance; or Spindleshins, for the very reason which\r\nbrought on the first Edward a similar nickname. Mr. Macshane then\r\nquitted Worcester, mounted on Hayes's horse; leaving all parties at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree Rooks\xe2\x80\x9d not a little anxious for his return.\r\n\r\nThis was not to be expected until the next morning; and a weary nuit de\r\nnoces did Mr. Hayes pass. Dinner was served, and, according to promise,\r\nMr. Brock and his two friends enjoyed the meal along with the bride and\r\nbridegroom. Punch followed, and this was taken in company; then came\r\nsupper. Mr. Brock alone partook of this, the other two gentlemen\r\npreferring the society of their pipes and the landlady in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sorry entertainment, I confess,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ex-corporal, \xe2\x80\x9cand a\r\ndismal way for a gentleman to spend his bridal night; but somebody must\r\nstay with you, my dears: for who knows but you might take a fancy to\r\nscream out of window, and then there would be murder, and the deuce and\r\nall to pay. One of us must stay, and my friends love a pipe, so you must\r\nput up with my company until they can relieve guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reader will not, of course, expect that three people who were to\r\npass the night, however unwillingly, together in an inn-room, should\r\nsit there dumb and moody, and without any personal communication; on the\r\ncontrary, Mr. Brock, as an old soldier, entertained his prisoners with\r\nthe utmost courtesy, and did all that lay in his power, by the help\r\nof liquor and conversation, to render their durance tolerable. On\r\nthe bridegroom his attentions were a good deal thrown away: Mr. Hayes\r\nconsented to drink copiously, but could not be made to talk much; and,\r\nin fact, the fright of the seizure, the fate hanging over him should his\r\nparents refuse a ransom, and the tremendous outlay of money which would\r\ntake place should they accede to it, weighed altogether on his mind so\r\nmuch as utterly to unman it.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs. Cat, I don't think she was at all sorry in her heart to see\r\nthe old Corporal: for he had been a friend of old times--dear times to\r\nher; she had had from him, too, and felt for him, not a little kindness;\r\nand there was really a very tender, innocent friendship subsisting\r\nbetween this pair of rascals, who relished much a night's conversation\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe Corporal, after treating his prisoners to punch in great quantities,\r\nproposed the amusement of cards: over which Mr. Hayes had not been\r\noccupied more than an hour, when he found himself so excessively sleepy\r\nas to be persuaded to fling himself down on the bed dressed as he was,\r\nand there to snore away until morning.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catherine had no inclination for sleep; and the Corporal, equally\r\nwakeful, plied incessantly the bottle, and held with her a great deal\r\nof conversation. The sleep, which was equivalent to the absence, of John\r\nHayes took all restraint from their talk. She explained to Brock the\r\ncircumstances of her marriage, which we have already described; they\r\nwondered at the chance which had brought them together at the \xe2\x80\x9cThree\r\nRooks;\xe2\x80\x9d nor did Brock at all hesitate to tell her at once that his\r\ncalling was quite illegal, and that his intention was simply to extort\r\nmoney. The worthy Corporal had not the slightest shame regarding his\r\nown profession, and cut many jokes with Mrs. Cat about her late one; her\r\nattempt to murder the Count, and her future prospects as a wife.\r\n\r\nAnd here, having brought him upon the scene again, we may as well\r\nshortly narrate some of the principal circumstances which befell him\r\nafter his sudden departure from Birmingham; and which he narrated with\r\nmuch candour to Mrs. Catherine.\r\n\r\nHe rode the Captain's horse to Oxford (having exchanged his military\r\ndress for a civil costume on the road), and at Oxford he disposed of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge of Denmark,\xe2\x80\x9d a great bargain, to one of the heads of colleges.\r\nAs soon as Mr. Brock, who took on himself the style and title of Captain\r\nWood, had sufficiently examined the curiosities of the University, he\r\nproceeded at once to the capital: the only place for a gentleman of his\r\nfortune and figure.\r\n\r\nHere he read, with a great deal of philosophical indifference, in the\r\nDaily Post, the Courant, the Observator, the Gazette, and the chief\r\njournals of those days, which he made a point of examining at \xe2\x80\x9cButton's\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and \xe2\x80\x9cWill's,\xe2\x80\x9d an accurate description of his person, his clothes, and\r\nthe horse he rode, and a promise of fifty guineas' reward to any person\r\nwho would give an account of him (so that he might be captured) to\r\nCaptain Count Galgenstein at Birmingham, to Mr. Murfey at the \xe2\x80\x9cGolden\r\nBall\xe2\x80\x9d in the Savoy, or Mr. Bates at the \xe2\x80\x9cBlew Anchor in Pickadilly.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nCaptain Wood, in an enormous full-bottomed periwig that cost him sixty\r\npounds,[*] with high red heels to his shoes, a silver sword, and a\r\ngold snuff-box, and a large wound (obtained, he said, at the siege of\r\nBarcelona), which disfigured much of his countenance, and caused him to\r\ncover one eye, was in small danger, he thought, of being mistaken for\r\nCorporal Brock, the deserter of Cutts's; and strutted along the Mall\r\nwith as grave an air as the very best nobleman who appeared there.\r\nHe was generally, indeed, voted to be very good company; and as his\r\nexpenses were unlimited (\xe2\x80\x9cA few convent candlesticks,\xe2\x80\x9d my dear, he used\r\nto whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cmelt into a vast number of doubloons\xe2\x80\x9d), he commanded as\r\ngood society as he chose to ask for: and it was speedily known as a fact\r\nthroughout town, that Captain Wood, who had served under His Majesty\r\nCharles III. of Spain, had carried off the diamond petticoat of Our Lady\r\nof Compostella, and lived upon the proceeds of the fraud. People were\r\ngood Protestants in those days, and many a one longed to have been his\r\npartner in the pious plunder.\r\n\r\n     * In the ingenious contemporary history of Moll Flanders, a\r\n     periwig is mentioned as costing that sum.\r\n\r\nAll surmises concerning his wealth, Captain Wood, with much discretion,\r\nencouraged. He contradicted no report, but was quite ready to confirm\r\nall; and when two different rumours were positively put to him, he used\r\nonly to laugh, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, _I_ don't make the stories; but\r\nI'm not called upon to deny them; and I give you fair warning, that I\r\nshall assent to every one of them; so you may believe them or not, as\r\nyou please.\xe2\x80\x9d And so he had the reputation of being a gentleman, not only\r\nwealthy, but discreet. In truth, it was almost a pity that worthy Brock\r\nhad not been a gentleman born; in which case, doubtless, he would have\r\nlived and died as became his station; for he spent his money like\r\na gentleman, he loved women like a gentleman, he would fight like a\r\ngentleman, he gambled and got drunk like a gentleman. What did he want\r\nelse? Only a matter of six descents, a little money, and an estate, to\r\nrender him the equal of St. John or Harley. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, those were merry days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n would Mr. Brock say,--for he loved, in a good old age, to recount the\r\nstory of his London fashionable campaign;--\xe2\x80\x9cand when I think how near\r\nI was to become a great man, and to die perhaps a general, I can't but\r\nmarvel at the wicked obstinacy of my ill-luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what I did, my dear: I had lodgings in Piccadilly, as\r\nif I were a lord; I had two large periwigs, and three suits of laced\r\nclothes; I kept a little black dressed out like a Turk; I walked daily\r\nin the Mall; I dined at the politest ordinary in Covent Garden; I\r\nfrequented the best of coffee-houses, and knew all the pretty fellows of\r\nthe town; I cracked a bottle with Mr. Addison, and lent many a piece to\r\nDick Steele (a sad debauched rogue, my dear); and, above all, I'll tell\r\nyou what I did--the noblest stroke that sure ever a gentleman performed\r\nin my situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day, going into 'Will's,' I saw a crowd of gentlemen gathered\r\ntogether, and heard one of them say, 'Captain Wood! I don't know the\r\nman; but there was a Captain Wood in Southwell's regiment.' Egad, it was\r\nmy Lord Peterborough himself who was talking about me. So, putting off\r\nmy hat, I made a most gracious conge to my Lord, and said I knew HIM,\r\nand rode behind him at Barcelona on our entry into that town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No doubt you did, Captain Wood,' says my Lord, taking my hand; 'and\r\nno doubt you know me: for many more know Tom Fool, than Tom Fool knows.'\r\nAnd with this, at which all of us laughed, my Lord called for a bottle,\r\nand he and I sat down and drank it together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he was in disgrace, as you know, but he grew mighty fond of me,\r\nand--would you believe it?--nothing would satisfy him but presenting me\r\nat Court! Yes, to Her Sacred Majesty the Queen, and my Lady Marlborough,\r\nwho was in high feather. Ay, truly, the sentinels on duty used to\r\nsalute me as if I were Corporal John himself! I was on the high road to\r\nfortune. Charley Mordaunt used to call me Jack, and drink canary at my\r\nchambers; I used to make one at my Lord Treasurer's levee; I had\r\neven got Mr. Army-Secretary Walpole to take a hundred guineas as a\r\ncompliment: and he had promised me a majority: when bad luck turned, and\r\nall my fine hopes were overthrown in a twinkling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear, that after we had left that gaby, Galgenstein,--ha,\r\nha--with a gag in his mouth, and twopence-halfpenny in his pocket, the\r\nhonest Count was in the sorriest plight in the world; owing money here\r\nand there to tradesmen, a cool thousand to the Warwickshire Squire: and\r\nall this on eighty pounds a year! Well, for a little time the tradesmen\r\nheld their hands; while the jolly Count moved heaven and earth to\r\ncatch hold of his dear Corporal and his dear money-bags over again, and\r\nplacarded every town from London to Liverpool with descriptions of my\r\npretty person. The bird was flown, however,--the money clean gone,--and\r\nwhen there was no hope of regaining it, what did the creditors do but\r\nclap my gay gentleman into Shrewsbury gaol: where I wish he had rotted,\r\nfor my part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no such luck for honest Peter Brock, or Captain Wood, as he was in\r\nthose days. One blessed Monday I went to wait on Mr. Secretary, and\r\nhe squeezed my hand and whispered to me that I was to be Major of a\r\nregiment in Virginia--the very thing: for you see, my dear, I didn't\r\ncare about joining my Lord Duke in Flanders; being pretty well known\r\nto the army there. The Secretary squeezed my hand (it had a fifty-pound\r\nbill in it) and wished me joy, and called me Major, and bowed me out of\r\nhis closet into the ante-room; and, as gay as may be, I went off to\r\nthe 'Tilt-yard Coffee-house' in Whitehall, which is much frequented by\r\ngentlemen of our profession, where I bragged not a little of my good\r\nluck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmongst the company were several of my acquaintance, and amongst them\r\na gentleman I did not much care to see, look you! I saw a uniform that\r\nI knew--red and yellow facings--Cutts's, my dear; and the wearer of this\r\nwas no other than his Excellency Gustavus Adolphus Maximilian, whom we\r\nall know of!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stared me full in the face, right into my eye (t'other one was\r\npatched, you know), and after standing stock-still with his mouth open,\r\ngave a step back, and then a step forward, and then screeched out, 'It's\r\nBrock!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I beg your pardon, sir,' says I; 'did you speak to me?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I'll SWEAR it's Brock,' cries Gal, as soon as he hears my voice, and\r\nlaid hold of my cuff (a pretty bit of Mechlin as ever you saw, by the\r\nway).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Sirrah!' says I, drawing it back, and giving my Lord a little touch\r\nof the fist (just at the last button of the waistcoat, my dear,--a rare\r\nplace if you wish to prevent a man from speaking too much: it sent him\r\nreeling to the other end of the room). 'Ruffian!' says I. 'Dog!' says\r\nI. 'Insolent puppy and coxcomb! what do you mean by laying your hand on\r\nme?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Faith, Major, you giv him his BILLYFUL,' roared out a long Irish\r\nunattached ensign, that I had treated with many a glass of Nantz at the\r\ntavern. And so, indeed, I had; for the wretch could not speak for some\r\nminutes, and all the officers stood laughing at him, as he writhed and\r\nwriggled hideously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Gentlemen, this is a monstrous scandal,' says one officer. 'Men of\r\nrank and honour at fists like a parcel of carters!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Men of honour!' says the Count, who had fetched up his breath by this\r\ntime. (I made for the door, but Macshane held me and said, 'Major, you\r\nare not going to shirk him, sure?' Whereupon I gripped his hand and\r\nvowed I would have the dog's life.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Men of honour!' says the Count. 'I tell you the man is a deserter, a\r\nthief, and a swindler! He was my corporal, and ran away with a thou--'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Dog, you lie!' I roared out, and made another cut at him with my cane;\r\nbut the gentlemen rushed between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'O bluthanowns!' says honest Macshane, 'the lying scounthrel this\r\nfellow is! Gentlemen, I swear be me honour that Captain Wood was wounded\r\nat Barcelona; and that I saw him there; and that he and I ran away\r\ntogether at the battle of Almanza, and bad luck to us.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear, that these Irish have the strongest imaginations in\r\nthe world; and that I had actually persuaded poor Mac that he and I were\r\nfriends in Spain. Everybody knew Mac, who was a character in his way,\r\nand believed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Strike a gentleman,' says I. 'I'll have your blood, I will.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This instant,' says the Count, who was boiling with fury; 'and where\r\nyou like.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Montague House,' says I. 'Good,' says he. And off we went. In\r\ngood time too, for the constables came in at the thought of such a\r\ndisturbance, and wanted to take us in charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the gentlemen present, being military men, would not hear of\r\nthis. Out came Mac's rapier, and that of half-a-dozen others; and the\r\nconstables were then told to do their duty if they liked, or to take a\r\ncrown-piece, and leave us to ourselves. Off they went; and presently, in\r\na couple of coaches, the Count and his friends, I and mine, drove off to\r\nthe fields behind Montague House. Oh that vile coffee-house! why did I\r\nenter it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe came to the ground. Honest Macshane was my second, and much\r\ndisappointed because the second on the other side would not make a fight\r\nof it, and exchange a few passes with him; but he was an old major,\r\na cool old hand, as brave as steel, and no fool. Well, the swords\r\nare measured, Galgenstein strips off his doublet, and I my handsome\r\ncut-velvet in like fashion. Galgenstein flings off his hat, and I handed\r\nmine over--the lace on it cost me twenty pounds. I longed to be at him,\r\nfor--curse him!--I hate him, and know that he has no chance with me at\r\nsword's-play.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You'll not fight in that periwig, sure?' says Macshane. 'Of course\r\nnot,' says I, and took it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay all barbers be roasted in flames; may all periwigs, bobwigs,\r\nscratchwigs, and Ramillies cocks, frizzle in purgatory from this day\r\nforth to the end of time! Mine was the ruin of me: what might I not have\r\nbeen now but for that wig!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave it over to Ensign Macshane, and with it went what I had quite\r\nforgotten, the large patch which I wore over one eye, which popped out\r\nfierce, staring, and lively as was ever any eye in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come on!' says I, and made a lunge at my Count; but he sprang back\r\n(the dog was as active as a hare, and knew, from old times, that I was\r\nhis master with the small-sword), and his second, wondering, struck up\r\nmy blade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I will not fight that man,' says he, looking mighty pale. 'I swear\r\nupon my honour that his name is Peter Brock: he was for two years\r\nmy corporal, and deserted, running away with a thousand pounds of my\r\nmoneys. Look at the fellow! What is the matter with his eye? why did he\r\nwear a patch over it? But stop!' says he. 'I have more proof. Hand me\r\nmy pocket-book.' And from it, sure enough, he produced the infernal\r\nproclamation announcing my desertion! 'See if the fellow has a scar\r\nacross his left ear' (and I can't say, my dear, but what I have: it was\r\ndone by a cursed Dutchman at the Boyne). 'Tell me if he has not got\r\nC.R. in blue upon his right arm' (and there it is sure enough). 'Yonder\r\nswaggering Irishman may be his accomplice for what I know; but I will\r\nhave no dealings with Mr. Brock, save with a constable for a second.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'This is an odd story, Captain Wood,' said the old Major who acted for\r\nthe Count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'A scounthrelly falsehood regarding me and my friend!' shouted out Mr.\r\nMacshane; 'and the Count shall answer for it.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Stop, stop!' says the Major. 'Captain Wood is too gallant a gentleman,\r\nI am sure, not to satisfy the Count; and will show us that he has no\r\nsuch mark on his arm as only private soldiers put there.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Captain Wood,' says I, 'will do no such thing, Major. I'll fight that\r\nscoundrel Galgenstein, or you, or any of you, like a man of honour; but\r\nI won't submit to be searched like a thief!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'No, in coorse,' said Macshane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I must take my man off the ground,' says the Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, take him, sir,' says I, in a rage; 'and just let me have the\r\npleasure of telling him that he's a coward and a liar; and that my\r\nlodgings are in Piccadilly, where, if ever he finds courage to meet me,\r\nhe may hear of me!'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Faugh! I shpit on ye all,' cries my gallant ally Macshane. And sure\r\nenough he kept his word, or all but--suiting the action to it at any\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so we gathered up our clothes, and went back in our separate\r\ncoaches, and no blood spilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'And is it thrue now,' said Mr. Macshane, when we were alone--'is\r\nit thrue now, all these divvles have been saying?' 'Ensign,' says I,\r\n'you're a man of the world?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c''Deed and I am, and insign these twenty-two years.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Perhaps you'd like a few pieces?' says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Faith and I should; for to tell you the secred thrut, I've not tasted\r\nmate these four days.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well then, Ensign, it IS true,' says I; 'and as for meat, you shall\r\nhave some at the first cook-shop.' I bade the coach stop until he bought\r\na plateful, which he ate in the carriage, for my time was precious. I\r\njust told him the whole story: at which he laughed, and swore that it\r\nwas the best piece of GENERALSHIP he ever heard on. When his belly was\r\nfull, I took out a couple of guineas and gave them to him. Mr. Macshane\r\nbegan to cry at this, and kissed me, and swore he never would desert me:\r\nas, indeed, my dear, I don't think he will; for we have been the best of\r\nfriends ever since, and he's the only man I ever could trust, I think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know what put it into my head, but I had a scent of some\r\nmischief in the wind; so stopped the coach a little before I got home,\r\nand, turning into a tavern, begged Macshane to go before me to my\r\nlodging, and see if the coast was clear: which he did; and came back to\r\nme as pale as death, saying that the house was full of constables. The\r\ncursed quarrel at the Tilt-yard had, I suppose, set the beaks upon me;\r\nand a pretty sweep they made of it. Ah, my dear! five hundred pounds\r\nin money, five suits of laced clothes, three periwigs, besides laced\r\nshirts, swords, canes, and snuff-boxes; and all to go back to that\r\nscoundrel Count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all over with me, I saw--no more being a gentleman for me; and\r\nif I remained to be caught, only a choice between Tyburn and a file\r\nof grenadiers. My love, under such circumstances, a gentleman can't be\r\nparticular, and must be prompt; the livery-stable was hard by where I\r\nused to hire my coach to go to Court,--ha! ha!--and was known as a man\r\nof substance. Thither I went immediately. 'Mr. Warmmash,' says I,\r\n'my gallant friend here and I have a mind for a ride and a supper at\r\nTwickenham, so you must lend us a pair of your best horses.' Which he\r\ndid in a twinkling, and off we rode.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not go into the Park, but turned off and cantered smartly up\r\ntowards Kilburn; and, when we got into the country, galloped as if\r\nthe devil were at our heels. Bless you, my love, it was all done in\r\na minute: and the Ensign and I found ourselves regular knights of the\r\nroad, before we knew where we were almost. Only think of our finding you\r\nand your new husband at the 'Three Rooks'! There's not a greater fence\r\nthan the landlady in all the country. It was she that put us on seizing\r\nyour husband, and introduced us to the other two gentlemen, whose names\r\nI don't know any more than the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what became of the horses?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Catherine to Mr. Brock, when\r\nhis tale was finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRips, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cmere rips. We sold them at Stourbridge fair,\r\nand got but thirteen guineas for the two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd--and--the Count, Max; where is he, Brock?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew!\xe2\x80\x9d whistled Mr. Brock. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, hankering after him still? My dear,\r\nhe is off to Flanders with his regiment; and, I make no doubt, there\r\nhave been twenty Countesses of Galgenstein since your time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't believe any such thing, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Catherine, starting up\r\nvery angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you did, I suppose you'd laudanum him; wouldn't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave the room, fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. But she recollected herself\r\nspeedily again; and, clasping her hands, and looking very wretched\r\nat Brock, at the ceiling, at the floor, at her husband (from whom she\r\nviolently turned away her head), she began to cry piteously: to which\r\ntears the Corporal set up a gentle accompaniment of whistling, as they\r\ntrickled one after another down her nose.\r\n\r\nI don't think they were tears of repentance; but of regret for the time\r\nwhen she had her first love, and her fine clothes, and her white hat and\r\nblue feather. Of the two, the Corporal's whistle was much more innocent\r\nthan the girl's sobbing: he was a rogue; but a good-natured old fellow\r\nwhen his humour was not crossed. Surely our novel-writers make a great\r\nmistake in divesting their rascals of all gentle human qualities:\r\nthey have such--and the only sad point to think of is, in all private\r\nconcerns of life, abstract feelings, and dealings with friends, and\r\nso on, how dreadfully like a rascal is to an honest man. The man who\r\nmurdered the Italian boy, set him first to play with his children whom\r\nhe loved, and who doubtless deplored his loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. ADVENTURES OF THE AMBASSADOR, MR. MACSHANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we had not been obliged to follow history in all respects, it\r\nis probable that we should have left out the last adventure of Mrs.\r\nCatherine and her husband, at the inn at Worcester, altogether; for, in\r\ntruth, very little came of it, and it is not very romantic or striking.\r\nBut we are bound to stick closely, above all, by THE TRUTH--the truth,\r\nthough it be not particularly pleasant to read of or to tell. As anybody\r\nmay read in the \xe2\x80\x9cNewgate Calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. and Mrs. Hayes were taken at\r\nan inn at Worcester; were confined there; were swindled by persons who\r\npretended to impress the bridegroom for military service. What is one\r\nto do after that? Had we been writing novels instead of authentic\r\nhistories, we might have carried them anywhere else we chose: and we\r\nhad a great mind to make Hayes philosophising with Bolingbroke, like a\r\ncertain Devereux; and Mrs. Catherine maitresse en titre to Mr. Alexander\r\nPope, Doctor Sacheverel, Sir John Reade the oculist, Dean Swift,\r\nor Marshal Tallard; as the very commonest romancer would under such\r\ncircumstances. But alas and alas! truth must be spoken, whatever else\r\nis in the wind; and the excellent \xe2\x80\x9cNewgate Calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d which contains the\r\nbiographies and thanatographies of Hayes and his wife, does not say a\r\nword of their connections with any of the leading literary or military\r\nheroes of the time of Her Majesty Queen Anne. The \xe2\x80\x9cCalendar\xe2\x80\x9d says, in so\r\nmany words, that Hayes was obliged to send to his father in Warwickshire\r\nfor money to get him out of the scrape, and that the old gentleman came\r\ndown to his aid. By this truth must we stick; and not for the sake of\r\nthe most brilliant episode,--no, not for a bribe of twenty extra guineas\r\nper sheet, would we depart from it.\r\n\r\nMr. Brock's account of his adventure in London has given the reader\r\nsome short notice of his friend, Mr Macshane. Neither the wits nor the\r\nprinciples of that worthy Ensign were particularly firm: for drink,\r\npoverty, and a crack on the skull at the battle of Steenkirk had served\r\nto injure the former; and the Ensign was not in his best days possessed\r\nof any share of the latter. He had really, at one period, held such a\r\nrank in the army, but pawned his half-pay for drink and play; and for\r\nmany years past had lived, one of the hundred thousand miracles of our\r\ncity, upon nothing that anybody knew of, or of which he himself could\r\ngive any account. Who has not a catalogue of these men in his list?\r\nwho can tell whence comes the occasional clean shirt, who supplies\r\nthe continual means of drunkenness, who wards off the daily-impending\r\nstarvation? Their life is a wonder from day to day: their breakfast\r\na wonder; their dinner a miracle; their bed an interposition of\r\nProvidence. If you and I, my dear sir, want a shilling tomorrow, who\r\nwill give it us? Will OUR butchers give us mutton-chops? will OUR\r\nlaundresses clothe us in clean linen?--not a bone or a rag. Standing as\r\nwe do (may it be ever so) somewhat removed from want,[*] is there one of\r\nus who does not shudder at the thought of descending into the lists to\r\ncombat with it, and expect anything but to be utterly crushed in the\r\nencounter?\r\n\r\n     * The author, it must be remembered, has his lodgings and\r\n     food provided for him by the government of his country.\r\n\r\nNot a bit of it, my dear sir. It takes much more than you think for to\r\nstarve a man. Starvation is very little when you are used to it. Some\r\npeople I know even, who live on it quite comfortably, and make their\r\ndaily bread by it. It had been our friend Macshane's sole profession for\r\nmany years; and he did not fail to draw from it such a livelihood as was\r\nsufficient, and perhaps too good, for him. He managed to dine upon it\r\na certain or rather uncertain number of days in the week, to sleep\r\nsomewhere, and to get drunk at least three hundred times a year. He\r\nwas known to one or two noblemen who occasionally helped him with a\r\nfew pieces, and whom he helped in turn--never mind how. He had\r\nother acquaintances whom he pestered undauntedly; and from whom he\r\noccasionally extracted a dinner, or a crown, or mayhap, by mistake, a\r\ngoldheaded cane, which found its way to the pawnbroker's. When flush of\r\ncash, he would appear at the coffee-house; when low in funds, the deuce\r\nknows into what mystic caves and dens he slunk for food and lodging. He\r\nwas perfectly ready with his sword, and when sober, or better still, a\r\nvery little tipsy, was a complete master of it; in the art of boasting\r\nand lying he had hardly any equals; in shoes he stood six feet five\r\ninches; and here is his complete signalement. It was a fact that he had\r\nbeen in Spain as a volunteer, where he had shown some gallantry, had had\r\na brain-fever, and was sent home to starve as before.\r\n\r\nMr. Macshane had, however, like Mr. Conrad, the Corsair, one virtue in\r\nthe midst of a thousand crimes,--he was faithful to his employer for the\r\ntime being: and a story is told of him, which may or may not be to\r\nhis credit, viz. that being hired on one occasion by a certain lord to\r\ninflict a punishment upon a roturier who had crossed his lordship in\r\nhis amours, he, Macshane, did actually refuse from the person to be\r\nbelaboured, and who entreated his forbearance, a larger sum of\r\nmoney than the nobleman gave him for the beating; which he performed\r\npunctually, as bound in honour and friendship. This tale would the\r\nEnsign himself relate, with much self-satisfaction; and when, after the\r\nsudden flight from London, he and Brock took to their roving occupation,\r\nhe cheerfully submitted to the latter as his commanding officer, called\r\nhim always Major, and, bating blunders and drunkenness, was perfectly\r\ntrue to his leader. He had a notion--and, indeed, I don't know that\r\nit was a wrong one--that his profession was now, as before, strictly\r\nmilitary, and according to the rules of honour. Robbing he called\r\nplundering the enemy; and hanging was, in his idea, a dastardly and\r\ncruel advantage that the latter took, and that called for the sternest\r\nreprisals.\r\n\r\nThe other gentlemen concerned were strangers to Mr. Brock, who felt\r\nlittle inclined to trust either of them upon such a message, or with\r\nsuch a large sum to bring back. They had, strange to say, a similar\r\nmistrust on their side; but Mr. Brock lugged out five guineas, which he\r\nplaced in the landlady's hand as security for his comrade's return; and\r\nEnsign Macshane, being mounted on poor Hayes's own horse, set off to\r\nvisit the parents of that unhappy young man. It was a gallant sight to\r\nbehold our thieves' ambassador, in a faded sky-blue suit with orange\r\nfacings, in a pair of huge jack-boots unconscious of blacking, with\r\na mighty basket-hilted sword by his side, and a little shabby beaver\r\ncocked over a large tow-periwig, ride out from the inn of the \xe2\x80\x9cThree\r\nRooks\xe2\x80\x9d on his mission to Hayes's paternal village.\r\n\r\nIt was eighteen miles distant from Worcester; but Mr. Macshane performed\r\nthe distance in safety, and in sobriety moreover (for such had been his\r\ninstructions), and had no difficulty in discovering the house of old\r\nHayes: towards which, indeed, John's horse trotted incontinently. Mrs.\r\nHayes, who was knitting at the house-door, was not a little surprised\r\nat the appearance of the well-known grey gelding, and of the stranger\r\nmounted upon it.\r\n\r\nFlinging himself off the steed with much agility, Mr. Macshane, as soon\r\nas his feet reached the ground, brought them rapidly together, in order\r\nto make a profound and elegant bow to Mrs. Hayes; and slapping his\r\ngreasy beaver against his heart, and poking his periwig almost into the\r\nnose of the old lady, demanded whether he had the \xe2\x80\x9cshooprame honour of\r\nadthressing Misthriss Hees?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving been answered in the affirmative, he then proceeded to ask\r\nwhether there was a blackguard boy in the house who would take \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nhorse to the steeble;\xe2\x80\x9d whether \xe2\x80\x9che could have a dthrink of small-beer\r\nor buthermilk, being, faith, uncommon dthry;\xe2\x80\x9d and whether, finally, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\ncould be feevored with a few minutes' private conversation with her\r\nand Mr. Hees, on a matther of consitherable impartance.\xe2\x80\x9d All these\r\npreliminaries were to be complied with before Mr. Macshane would enter\r\nat all into the subject of his visit. The horse and man were cared for;\r\nMr. Hayes was called in; and not a little anxious did Mrs. Hayes grow,\r\nin the meanwhile, with regard to the fate of her darling son. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is\r\nhe? How is he? Is he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I'm sure he's\r\ndead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, madam, and you're misteeken intirely: the young man is\r\nperfectly well in health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, praised be Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut mighty cast down in sperrits. To misfortunes, madam, look you, the\r\nbest of us are subject; and a trifling one has fell upon your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd herewith Mr. Macshane produced a letter in the handwriting of young\r\nHayes, of which we have had the good luck to procure a copy. It ran\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHONORED FATHER AND MOTHER,--The bearer of this is a kind gentleman, who\r\nhas left me in a great deal of trouble. Yesterday, at this towne, I fell\r\nin with some gentlemen of the queene's servas; after drinking with\r\nwhom, I accepted her Majesty's mony to enliste. Repenting thereof, I did\r\nendeavour to escape; and, in so doing, had the misfortune to strike my\r\nsuperior officer, whereby I made myself liable to Death, according to\r\nthe rules of warr. If, however, I pay twenty ginnys, all will be wel.\r\nYou must give the same to the barer, els I shall be shott without fail\r\non Tewsday morning. And so no more from your loving son,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJOHN HAYES.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my prison at Bristol, this unhappy Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Hayes read this pathetic missive, its success with her\r\nwas complete, and she was for going immediately to the cupboard, and\r\nproducing the money necessary for her darling son's release. But the\r\ncarpenter Hayes was much more suspicious. \xe2\x80\x9cI don't know you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe to the ambassador.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you doubt my honour, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ensign, very fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Hayes \xe2\x80\x9cI know little about it one way or other,\r\nbut shall take it for granted, if you will explain a little more of this\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sildom condescind to explean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macshane, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it's not the\r\ncustom in my rank; but I'll explean anything in reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, will you tell me in what regiment my son is enlisted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn coorse. In Colonel Wood's fut, my dear; and a gallant corps it is as\r\nany in the army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you left him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn me soul, only three hours ago, having rid like a horse-jockey ever\r\nsince; as in the sacred cause of humanity, curse me, every man should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Hayes's house was seventy miles from Bristol, the old gentleman\r\nthought this was marvellous quick riding, and so, cut the conversation\r\nshort. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have said quite enough, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto show me there\r\nis some roguery in the matter, and that the whole story is false from\r\nbeginning to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this abrupt charge the Ensign looked somewhat puzzled, and then spoke\r\nwith much gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cRoguery,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cMisthur Hees, is a sthrong term;\r\nand which, in consideration of my friendship for your family, I shall\r\npass over. You doubt your son's honour, as there wrote by him in black\r\nand white?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have forced him to write,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hayes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sly old divvle's right,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mr. Macshane, aside. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\r\nto make a clean breast of it, he HAS been forced to write it. The story\r\nabout the enlistment is a pretty fib, if you will, from beginning to\r\nend. And what then, my dear? Do you think your son's any better off for\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Mrs. Hayes, plumping down on her knees. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nWILL give him the money, won't we, John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you will, madam, when I tell you where he is. He is in the hands\r\nof some gentlemen of my acquaintance, who are at war with the present\r\ngovernment, and no more care about cutting a man's throat than they do\r\na chicken's. He is a prisoner, madam, of our sword and spear. If you\r\nchoose to ransom him, well and good; if not, peace be with him! for\r\nnever more shall you see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do I know you won't come back to-morrow for more money?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMr. Hayes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, you have my honour; and I'd as lieve break my neck as my word,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mr. Macshane, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty guineas is the bargain. Take ten\r\nminutes to talk of it--take it then, or leave it; it's all the same\r\nto me, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d And it must be said of our friend the Ensign, that he\r\nmeant every word he said, and that he considered the embassy on which he\r\nhad come as perfectly honourable and regular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, what prevents us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hayes, starting up in a rage,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfrom taking hold of you, as a surety for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn't fire on a flag of truce, would ye, you dishonourable\r\nould civilian?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Macshane. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere's more\r\nreasons to prevent you: the first is this,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to his sword; \xe2\x80\x9chere\r\nare two more\xe2\x80\x9d--and these were pistols; \xe2\x80\x9cand the last and the best of all\r\nis, that you might hang me and dthraw me and quarther me, an yet never\r\nsee so much as the tip of your son's nose again. Look you, sir, we run\r\nmighty risks in our profession--it's not all play, I can tell you.\r\nWe're obliged to be punctual, too, or it's all up with the thrade. If I\r\npromise that your son will die as sure as fate to-morrow morning, unless\r\nI return home safe, our people MUST keep my promise; or else what chance\r\nis there for me? You would be down upon me in a moment with a posse of\r\nconstables, and have me swinging before Warwick gaol. Pooh, my dear! you\r\nnever would sacrifice a darling boy like John Hayes, let alone his lady,\r\nfor the sake of my long carcass. One or two of our gentlemen have been\r\ntaken that way already, because parents and guardians would not believe\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAND WHAT BECAME OF THE POOR CHILDREN?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hayes, who began to\r\nperceive the gist of the argument, and to grow dreadfully frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't let's talk of them, ma'am: humanity shudthers at the thought!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And herewith Mr. Macshane drew his finger across his throat in such a\r\ndreadful way as to make the two parents tremble. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's the way of war,\r\nmadam, look you. The service I have the honour to belong to is not paid\r\nby the Queen; and so we're obliged to make our prisoners pay, according\r\nto established military practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo lawyer could have argued his case better than Mr. Macshane so far;\r\nand he completely succeeded in convincing Mr. and Mrs. Hayes of the\r\nnecessity of ransoming their son. Promising that the young man should\r\nbe restored to them next morning, along with his beautiful lady, he\r\ncourteously took leave of the old couple, and made the best of his way\r\nback to Worcester again. The elder Hayes wondered who the lady could\r\nbe of whom the ambassador had spoken, for their son's elopement was\r\naltogether unknown to them; but anger or doubt about this subject was\r\noverwhelmed by their fears for their darling John's safety. Away rode\r\nthe gallant Macshane with the money necessary to effect this; and it\r\nmust be mentioned, as highly to his credit, that he never once thought\r\nof appropriating the sum to himself, or of deserting his comrades in any\r\nway.\r\n\r\nHis ride from Worcester had been a long one. He had left that city\r\nat noon, but before his return thither the sun had gone down; and the\r\nlandscape, which had been dressed like a prodigal, in purple and\r\ngold, now appeared like a Quaker, in dusky grey; and the trees by the\r\nroad-side grew black as undertakers or physicians, and, bending their\r\nsolemn heads to each other, whispered ominously among themselves; and\r\nthe mists hung on the common; and the cottage lights went out one by\r\none; and the earth and heaven grew black, but for some twinkling useless\r\nstars, which freckled the ebon countenance of the latter; and the\r\nair grew colder; and about two o'clock the moon appeared, a dismal\r\npale-faced rake, walking solitary through the deserted sky; and about\r\nfour, mayhap, the Dawn (wretched 'prentice-boy!) opened in the east\r\nthe shutters of the Day:--in other words, more than a dozen hours had\r\npassed. Corporal Brock had been relieved by Mr. Redcap, the latter by\r\nMr. Sicklop, the one-eyed gentleman; Mrs. John Hayes, in spite of her\r\nsorrows and bashfulness, had followed the example of her husband, and\r\nfallen asleep by his side--slept for many hours--and awakened still\r\nunder the guardianship of Mr. Brock's troop; and all parties began\r\nanxiously to expect the return of the ambassador, Mr. Macshane.\r\n\r\nThat officer, who had performed the first part of his journey with such\r\ndistinguished prudence and success, found the night, on his journey\r\nhomewards, was growing mighty cold and dark; and as he was thirsty and\r\nhungry, had money in his purse, and saw no cause to hurry, he determined\r\nto take refuge at an alehouse for the night, and to make for Worcester\r\nby dawn the next morning. He accordingly alighted at the first inn on\r\nhis road, consigned his horse to the stable, and, entering the kitchen,\r\ncalled for the best liquor in the house.\r\n\r\nA small company was assembled at the inn, among whom Mr. Macshane took\r\nhis place with a great deal of dignity; and, having a considerable sum\r\nof money in his pocket, felt a mighty contempt for his society, and soon\r\nlet them know the contempt he felt for them. After a third flagon of\r\nale, he discovered that the liquor was sour, and emptied, with much\r\nspluttering and grimaces, the remainder of the beer into the fire. This\r\nprocess so offended the parson of the parish (who in those good old\r\ntimes did not disdain to take the post of honour in the chimney-nook),\r\nthat he left his corner, looking wrathfully at the offender; who without\r\nany more ado instantly occupied it. It was a fine thing to hear\r\nthe jingling of the twenty pieces in his pocket, the oaths which he\r\ndistributed between the landlord, the guests, and the liquor--to remark\r\nthe sprawl of his mighty jack-boots, before the sweep of which the timid\r\nguests edged farther and farther away; and the languishing leers which\r\nhe cast on the landlady, as with wide-spread arms he attempted to seize\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nWhen the ostler had done his duties in the stable, he entered the inn,\r\nand whispered the landlord that \xe2\x80\x9cthe stranger was riding John Hayes's\r\nhorse:\xe2\x80\x9d of which fact the host soon convinced himself, and did not fail\r\nto have some suspicions of his guest. Had he not thought that times\r\nwere unquiet, horses might be sold, and one man's money was as good as\r\nanother's, he probably would have arrested the Ensign immediately, and\r\nso lost all the profit of the score which the latter was causing every\r\nmoment to be enlarged.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of hours, with that happy facility which one may have\r\noften remarked in men of the gallant Ensign's nation, he had managed to\r\ndisgust every one of the landlord's other guests, and scare them from\r\nthe kitchen. Frightened by his addresses, the landlady too had taken\r\nflight; and the host was the only person left in the apartment; who\r\nthere stayed for interest's sake merely, and listened moodily to\r\nhis tipsy guest's conversation. In an hour more, the whole house was\r\nawakened by a violent noise of howling, curses, and pots clattering to\r\nand fro. Forth issued Mrs. Landlady in her night-gear, out came John\r\nOstler with his pitchfork, downstairs tumbled Mrs. Cook and one or two\r\nguests, and found the landlord and ensign on the kitchen-floor--the wig\r\nof the latter lying, much singed and emitting strange odours, in the\r\nfireplace, his face hideously distorted, and a great quantity of his\r\nnatural hair in the partial occupation of the landlord; who had drawn it\r\nand the head down towards him, in order that he might have the benefit\r\nof pummelling the latter more at his ease. In revenge, the landlord was\r\nundermost, and the Ensign's arms were working up and down his face and\r\nbody like the flaps of a paddle-wheel: the man of war had clearly the\r\nbest of it.\r\n\r\nThe combatants were separated as soon as possible; but, as soon as the\r\nexcitement of the fight was over, Ensign Macshane was found to have no\r\nfurther powers of speech, sense, or locomotion, and was carried by his\r\nlate antagonist to bed. His sword and pistols, which had been placed at\r\nhis side at the commencement of the evening, were carefully put by,\r\nand his pocket visited. Twenty guineas in gold, a large knife--used,\r\nprobably, for the cutting of bread-and-cheese--some crumbs of those\r\ndelicacies and a paper of tobacco found in the breeches-pockets, and in\r\nthe bosom of the sky-blue coat, the leg of a cold fowl and half of a raw\r\nonion, constituted his whole property.\r\n\r\nThese articles were not very suspicious; but the beating which the\r\nlandlord had received tended greatly to confirm his own and his wife's\r\ndoubts about their guest; and it was determined to send off in the early\r\nmorning to Mr. Hayes, informing him how a person had lain at their inn\r\nwho had ridden thither mounted upon young Hayes's horse. Off set John\r\nOstler at earliest dawn; but on his way he woke up Mr. Justice's clerk,\r\nand communicated his suspicions to him; and Mr. Clerk consulted with the\r\nvillage baker, who was always up early; and the clerk, the baker, the\r\nbutcher with his cleaver, and two gentlemen who were going to work, all\r\nadjourned to the inn.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when Ensign Macshane was in a truckle-bed, plunged in that\r\ndeep slumber which only innocence and drunkenness enjoy in this world,\r\nand charming the ears of morn by the regular and melodious music of\r\nhis nose, a vile plot was laid against him; and when about seven of the\r\nclock he woke, he found, on sitting up in his bed, three gentlemen on\r\neach side of it, armed, and looking ominous. One held a constable's\r\nstaff, and albeit unprovided with a warrant, would take upon himself the\r\nresponsibility of seizing Mr. Macshane and of carrying him before his\r\nworship at the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaranouns, man!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ensign, springing up in bed, and abruptly\r\nbreaking off a loud sonorous yawn, with which he had opened the business\r\nof the day, \xe2\x80\x9cyou won't deteen a gentleman who's on life and death? I\r\ngive ye my word, an affair of honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came you by that there horse?\xe2\x80\x9d said the baker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came you by these here fifteen guineas?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, in\r\nwhose hands, by some process, five of the gold pieces had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this here idolatrous string of beads?\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk.\r\n\r\nMr. Macshane, the fact is, was a Catholic, but did not care to own it:\r\nfor in those days his religion was not popular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaids? Holy Mother of saints! give me back them baids,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nMacshane, clasping his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were blest, I tell you, by his\r\nholiness the po--psha! I mane they belong to a darling little daughter\r\nI had that's in heaven now: and as for the money and the horse, I should\r\nlike to know how a gentleman is to travel in this counthry without\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you see, he may travel in the country to GIT 'em,\xe2\x80\x9d here shrewdly\r\nremarked the constable; \xe2\x80\x9cand it's our belief that neither horse nor\r\nmoney is honestly come by. If his worship is satisfied, why so, in\r\ncourse, shall we be; but there is highwaymen abroad, look you; and, to\r\nour notion, you have very much the cut of one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFurther remonstrances or threats on the part of Mr. Macshane were\r\nuseless. Although he vowed that he was first cousin to the Duke of\r\nLeinster, an officer in Her Majesty's service, and the dearest friend\r\nLord Marlborough had, his impudent captors would not believe a word of\r\nhis statement (which, further, was garnished with a tremendous number\r\nof oaths); and he was, about eight o'clock, carried up to the house of\r\nSquire Ballance, the neighbouring justice of the peace.\r\n\r\nWhen the worthy magistrate asked the crime of which the prisoner had\r\nbeen guilty, the captors looked somewhat puzzled for the moment; since,\r\nin truth, it could not be shown that the Ensign had committed any crime\r\nat all; and if he had confined himself to simple silence, and thrown\r\nupon them the onus of proving his misdemeanours, Justice Ballance must\r\nhave let him loose, and soundly rated his clerk and the landlord for\r\ndetaining an honest gentleman on so frivolous a charge.\r\n\r\nBut this caution was not in the Ensign's disposition; and though his\r\naccusers produced no satisfactory charge against him, his own words were\r\nquite enough to show how suspicious his character was. When asked his\r\nname, he gave it in as Captain Geraldine, on his way to Ireland,\r\nby Bristol, on a visit to his cousin the Duke of Leinster. He\r\nswore solemnly that his friends, the Duke of Marlborough and Lord\r\nPeterborough, under both of whom he had served, should hear of the\r\nmanner in which he had been treated; and when the justice,--a sly old\r\ngentleman, and one that read the Gazettes, asked him at what battles he\r\nhad been present, the gallant Ensign pitched on a couple in Spain and in\r\nFlanders, which had been fought within a week of each other, and vowed\r\nthat he had been desperately wounded at both; so that, at the end of his\r\nexamination, which had been taken down by the clerk, he had been made\r\nto acknowledge as follows:--Captain Geraldine, six feet four inches in\r\nheight; thin, with a very long red nose, and red hair; grey eyes, and\r\nspeaks with a strong Irish accent; is the first-cousin of the Duke of\r\nLeinster, and in constant communication with him: does not know whether\r\nhis Grace has any children; does not know whereabouts he lives\r\nin London; cannot say what sort of a looking man his Grace is: is\r\nacquainted with the Duke of Marlborough, and served in the dragoons at\r\nthe battle of Ramillies; at which time he was with my Lord Peterborough\r\nbefore Barcelona. Borrowed the horse which he rides from a friend in\r\nLondon, three weeks since. Peter Hobbs, ostler, swears that it was in\r\nhis master's stable four days ago, and is the property of John Hayes,\r\ncarpenter. Cannot account for the fifteen guineas found on him by the\r\nlandlord; says there were twenty; says he won them at cards, a fortnight\r\nsince, at Edinburgh; says he is riding about the country for his\r\namusement: afterwards says he is on a matter of life and death, and\r\ngoing to Bristol; declared last night, in the hearing of several\r\nwitnesses, that he was going to York; says he is a man of independent\r\nproperty, and has large estates in Ireland, and a hundred thousand\r\npounds in the Bank of England. Has no shirt or stockings, and the coat\r\nhe wears is marked \xe2\x80\x9cS.S.\xe2\x80\x9d In his boots is written \xe2\x80\x9cThomas Rodgers,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nin his hat is the name of the \xe2\x80\x9cRev. Doctor Snoffler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor Snoffler lived at Worcester, and had lately advertised in the Hue\r\nand Cry a number of articles taken from his house. Mr. Macshane said,\r\nin reply to this, that his hat had been changed at the inn, and he was\r\nready to take his oath that he came thither in a gold-laced one. But\r\nthis fact was disproved by the oaths of many persons who had seen him at\r\nthe inn. And he was about to be imprisoned for the thefts which he had\r\nnot committed (the fact about the hat being, that he had purchased it\r\nfrom a gentleman at the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Rooks\xe2\x80\x9d for two pints of beer)--he was\r\nabout to be remanded, when, behold, Mrs. Hayes the elder made her\r\nappearance; and to her it was that the Ensign was indebted for his\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nOld Hayes had gone to work before the ostler arrived; but when his wife\r\nheard the lad's message, she instantly caused her pillion to be placed\r\nbehind the saddle, and mounting the grey horse, urged the stable-boy to\r\ngallop as hard as ever he could to the justice's house.\r\n\r\nShe entered panting and alarmed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what is your honour going to do\r\nto this honest gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of Heaven, let him go!\r\nHis time is precious--he has important business--business of life and\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tould the jidge so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ensign, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he refused to take my\r\nword--the sacred wurrd of honour of Captain Geraldine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMacshane was good at a single lie, though easily flustered on an\r\nexamination; and this was a very creditable stratagem to acquaint Mrs.\r\nHayes with the name that he bore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you know Captain Geraldine?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Ballance, who was perfectly\r\nwell acquainted with the carpenter's wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn coorse she does. Hasn't she known me these tin years? Are we not\r\nrelated? Didn't she give me the very horse which I rode, and, to make\r\nbelave, tould you I'd bought in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her tell her own story. Are you related to Captain Geraldine, Mrs.\r\nHayes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--oh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very elegant connection! And you gave him the horse, did you, of your\r\nown free-will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! of my own will--I would give him anything. Do, do, your honour,\r\nlet him go! His child is dying,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, bursting into\r\ntears. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be dead before he gets to--before he gets there. Oh, your\r\nhonour, your honour, pray, pray, don't detain him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe justice did not seem to understand this excessive sympathy on the\r\npart of Mrs. Hayes; nor did the father himself appear to be nearly so\r\naffected by his child's probable fate as the honest woman who interested\r\nherself for him. On the contrary, when she made this passionate speech,\r\nCaptain Geraldine only grinned, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNiver mind, my dear. If\r\nhis honour will keep an honest gentleman for doing nothing, why, let\r\nhim--the law must settle between us; and as for the child, poor thing,\r\nthe Lord deliver it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, Mrs. Hayes fell to entreating more loudly than ever; and as\r\nthere was really no charge against him, Mr. Ballance was constrained to\r\nlet him go.\r\n\r\nThe landlord and his friends were making off, rather confused, when\r\nEnsign Macshane called upon the former in a thundering voice to stop,\r\nand refund the five guineas which he had stolen from him. Again the host\r\nswore there were but fifteen in his pocket. But when, on the Bible, the\r\nEnsign solemnly vowed that he had twenty, and called upon Mrs. Hayes to\r\nsay whether yesterday, half-an-hour before he entered the inn, she had\r\nnot seen him with twenty guineas, and that lady expressed herself ready\r\nto swear that she had, Mr. Landlord looked more crestfallen than ever,\r\nand said that he had not counted the money when he took it; and though\r\nhe did in his soul believe that there were only fifteen guineas, rather\r\nthan be suspected of a shabby action, he would pay the five guineas out\r\nof his own pocket: which he did, and with the Ensign's, or rather Mrs.\r\nHayes's, own coin.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were out of the justice's house, Mr. Macshane, in the\r\nfulness of his gratitude, could not help bestowing an embrace upon\r\nMrs. Hayes. And when she implored him to let her ride behind him to her\r\ndarling son, he yielded with a very good grace, and off the pair set on\r\nJohn Hayes's grey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has Nosey brought with him now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sicklop, Brock's one-eyed\r\nconfederate, who, about three hours after the above adventure, was\r\nlolling in the yard of the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Rooks.\xe2\x80\x9d It was our Ensign, with the\r\nmother of his captive. They had not met with any accident in their ride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall now have the shooprame bliss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macshane, with much\r\nfeeling, as he lifted Mrs. Hayes from the saddle---\xe2\x80\x9cthe shooprame bliss\r\nof intwining two harrts that are mead for one another. Ours, my dear,\r\nis a dismal profession; but ah! don't moments like this make aminds\r\nfor years of pain? This way, my dear. Turn to your right, then to your\r\nleft--mind the stip--and the third door round the corner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll these precautions were attended to; and after giving his concerted\r\nknock, Mr. Macshane was admitted into an apartment, which he entered\r\nholding his gold pieces in the one hand, and a lady by the other.\r\n\r\nWe shall not describe the meeting which took place between mother and\r\nson. The old lady wept copiously; the young man was really glad to see\r\nhis relative, for he deemed that his troubles were over. Mrs. Cat bit\r\nher lips, and stood aside, looking somewhat foolish; Mr. Brock counted\r\nthe money; and Mr. Macshane took a large dose of strong waters, as a\r\npleasing solace for his labours, dangers, and fatigue.\r\n\r\nWhen the maternal feelings were somewhat calmed, the old lady had\r\nleisure to look about her, and really felt a kind of friendship and\r\ngoodwill for the company of thieves in which she found herself. It\r\nseemed to her that they had conferred an actual favour on her, in\r\nrobbing her of twenty guineas, threatening her son's life, and finally\r\nletting him go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that droll old gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d said she; and being told that it was\r\nCaptain Wood, she dropped him a curtsey, and said, with much respect,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, your very humble servant;\xe2\x80\x9d which compliment Mr. Brock\r\nacknowledged by a gracious smile and bow. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is this pretty young\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Hayes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--hum--oh--mother, you must give her your blessing. She is Mrs. John\r\nHayes.\xe2\x80\x9d And herewith Mr. Hayes brought forward his interesting lady, to\r\nintroduce her to his mamma.\r\n\r\nThe news did not at all please the old lady; who received Mrs.\r\nCatherine's embrace with a very sour face indeed. However, the mischief\r\nwas done; and she was too glad to get back her son to be, on such an\r\noccasion, very angry with him. So, after a proper rebuke, she told Mrs.\r\nJohn Hayes that though she never approved of her son's attachment, and\r\nthought he married below his condition, yet as the evil was done, it was\r\ntheir duty to make the best of it; and she, for her part, would receive\r\nher into her house, and make her as comfortable there as she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether she has any more money in that house?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mr.\r\nSicklop to Mr. Redcap; who, with the landlady, had come to the door of\r\nthe room, and had been amusing themselves by the contemplation of this\r\nsentimental scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool that wild Hirishman was not to bleed her for more!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe landlady; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he's a poor ignorant Papist. I'm sure my man\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (this gentleman had been hanged), \xe2\x80\x9cwouldn't have come away with such a\r\nbeggarly sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we have some more out of 'em?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Redcap. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat prevents\r\nus? We have got the old mare, and the colt too,--ha! ha!--and the pair\r\nof 'em ought to be worth at least a hundred to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis conversation was carried on sotto voce; and I don't know whether\r\nMr. Brock had any notion of the plot which was arranged by the three\r\nworthies. The landlady began it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich punch, madam, will you take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have something for the good of the house, now you\r\nare in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn coorse,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ensign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other three. But the old lady said she was anxious\r\nto leave the place; and putting down a crown-piece, requested the\r\nhostess to treat the gentlemen in her absence. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAjew!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Ensign, \xe2\x80\x9cand long life to you, my dear. You got me out\r\nof a scrape at the justice's yonder; and, split me! but Insign Macshane\r\nwill remimber it as long as he lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now Hayes and the two ladies made for the door; but the landlady\r\nplaced herself against it, and Mr. Sicklop said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my pretty\r\nmadams, you ain't a-going off so cheap as that neither; you are not\r\ngoing out for a beggarly twenty guineas, look you,--we must have more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hayes starting back, and cursing his fate, fairly burst into tears;\r\nthe two women screamed; and Mr. Brock looked as if the proposition both\r\namused and had been expected by him: but not so Ensign Macshane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, clawing fiercely hold of Brock's arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnsign,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brock, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArr we, or arr we not, men of honour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in coorse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brock, laughing, and using Macshane's favourite\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we ARR men of honour, we are bound to stick to our word; and, hark\r\nye, you dirty one-eyed scoundrel, if you don't immadiately make way for\r\nthese leedies, and this lily-livered young jontleman who's crying so,\r\nthe Meejor here and I will lug out and force you.\xe2\x80\x9d And so saying,\r\nhe drew his great sword and made a pass at Mr. Sicklop; which that\r\ngentleman avoided, and which caused him and his companion to retreat\r\nfrom the door. The landlady still kept her position at it, and with a\r\nstorm of oaths against the Ensign, and against two Englishmen who ran\r\naway from a wild Hirishman, swore she would not budge a foot, and would\r\nstand there until her dying day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, then, needs must,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ensign, and made a lunge at the\r\nhostess, which passed so near the wretch's throat, that she screamed,\r\nsank on her knees, and at last opened the door.\r\n\r\nDown the stairs, then, with great state, Mr. Macshane led the elder\r\nlady, the married couple following; and having seen them to the street,\r\ntook an affectionate farewell of the party, whom he vowed that he would\r\ncome and see. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can walk the eighteen miles aisy, between this and\r\nnightfall,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWALK!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Hayes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, haven't we got Ball, and shall ride\r\nand tie all the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Macshane, in a stern voice, \xe2\x80\x9chonour before everything.\r\nDid you not, in the presence of his worship, vow and declare that you\r\ngave me that horse, and now d'ye talk of taking it back again? Let me\r\ntell you, madam, that such paltry thricks ill become a person of your\r\nyears and respectability, and ought never to be played with Insign\r\nTimothy Macshane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waved his hat and strutted down the street; and Mrs. Catherine Hayes,\r\nalong with her bridegroom and mother-in-law, made the best of their way\r\nhomeward on foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. WHICH EMBRACES A PERIOD OF SEVEN YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recovery of so considerable a portion of his property from the\r\nclutches of Brock was, as may be imagined, no trifling source of joy to\r\nthat excellent young man, Count Gustavus Adolphus de Galgenstein; and\r\nhe was often known to say, with much archness, and a proper feeling of\r\ngratitude to the Fate which had ordained things so, that the robbery\r\nwas, in reality, one of the best things that could have happened to him:\r\nfor, in event of Mr. Brock's NOT stealing the money, his Excellency the\r\nCount would have had to pay the whole to the Warwickshire Squire, who\r\nhad won it from him at play. He was enabled, in the present instance, to\r\nplead his notorious poverty as an excuse; and the Warwickshire conqueror\r\ngot off with nothing, except a very badly written autograph of the\r\nCount's, simply acknowledging the debt.\r\n\r\nThis point his Excellency conceded with the greatest candour; but (as,\r\ndoubtless, the reader may have remarked in the course of his experience)\r\nto owe is not quite the same thing as to pay; and from the day of his\r\nwinning the money until the day of his death the Warwickshire Squire\r\ndid never, by any chance, touch a single bob, tizzy, tester, moidore,\r\nmaravedi, doubloon, tomaun, or rupee, of the sum which Monsieur de\r\nGalgenstein had lost to him.\r\n\r\nThat young nobleman was, as Mr. Brock hinted in the little\r\nautobiographical sketch which we gave in a former chapter, incarcerated\r\nfor a certain period, and for certain other debts, in the donjons\r\nof Shrewsbury; but he released himself from them by that noble and\r\nconsolatory method of whitewashing which the law has provided for\r\ngentlemen in his oppressed condition; and he had not been a week in\r\nLondon, when he fell in with, and overcame, or put to flight, Captain\r\nWood, alias Brock, and immediately seized upon the remainder of his\r\nproperty. After receiving this, the Count, with commendable discretion,\r\ndisappeared from England altogether for a while; nor are we at all\r\nauthorised to state that any of his debts to his tradesmen were\r\ndischarged, any more than his debts of honour, as they are pleasantly\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nHaving thus settled with his creditors, the gallant Count had interest\r\nenough with some of the great folk to procure for himself a post abroad,\r\nand was absent in Holland for some time. It was here that he became\r\nacquainted with the lovely Madam Silverkoop, the widow of a deceased\r\ngentleman of Leyden; and although the lady was not at that age at which\r\ntender passions are usually inspired--being sixty--and though she could\r\nnot, like Mademoiselle Ninon de l'Enclos, then at Paris, boast of charms\r\nwhich defied the progress of time,--for Mrs. Silverkoop was as red as a\r\nboiled lobster, and as unwieldy as a porpoise; and although her mental\r\nattractions did by no means make up for her personal deficiencies,--for\r\nshe was jealous, violent, vulgar, drunken, and stingy to a miracle:\r\nyet her charms had an immediate effect on Monsieur de Galgenstein; and\r\nhence, perhaps, the reader (the rogue! how well he knows the world!)\r\nwill be led to conclude that the honest widow was RICH.\r\n\r\nSuch, indeed, she was; and Count Gustavus, despising the difference\r\nbetween his twenty quarterings and her twenty thousand pounds, laid the\r\nmost desperate siege to her, and finished by causing her to capitulate;\r\nas I do believe, after a reasonable degree of pressing, any woman will\r\ndo to any man: such, at least, has been MY experience in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Count then married; and it was curious to see how he--who, as\r\nwe have seen in the case of Mrs. Cat, had been as great a tiger and\r\ndomestic bully as any extant--now, by degrees, fell into a quiet\r\nsubmission towards his enormous Countess; who ordered him up and down as\r\na lady orders her footman, who permitted him speedily not to have a will\r\nof his own, and who did not allow him a shilling of her money without\r\nreceiving for the same an accurate account.\r\n\r\nHow was it that he, the abject slave of Madam Silverkoop, had been\r\nvictorious over Mrs. Cat? The first blow is, I believe, the decisive\r\none in these cases, and the Countess had stricken it a week after their\r\nmarriage;--establishing a supremacy which the Count never afterwards\r\nattempted to question.\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to his Excellency's marriage, as in duty bound, because\r\nit will be necessary to account for his appearance hereafter in a more\r\nsplendid fashion than that under which he has hitherto been known to us;\r\nand just comforting the reader by the knowledge that the union, though\r\nprosperous in a worldly point of view, was, in reality, extremely\r\nunhappy, we must say no more from this time forth of the fat and\r\nlegitimate Madam de Galgenstein. Our darling is Mrs. Catherine, who had\r\nformerly acted in her stead; and only in so much as the fat Countess\r\ndid influence in any way the destinies of our heroine, or those wise\r\nand virtuous persons who have appeared and are to follow her to her end,\r\nshall we in any degree allow her name to figure here. It is an awful\r\nthing to get a glimpse, as one sometimes does, when the time is past, of\r\nsome little little wheel which works the whole mighty machinery of FATE,\r\nand see how our destinies turn on a minute's delay or advance, or on the\r\nturning of a street, or on somebody else's turning of a street, or\r\non somebody else's doing of something else in Downing Street or in\r\nTimbuctoo, now or a thousand years ago. Thus, for instance, if Miss\r\nPoots, in the year 1695, had never been the lovely inmate of a Spielhaus\r\nat Amsterdam, Mr. Van Silverkoop would never have seen her; if the day\r\nhad not been extraordinarily hot, the worthy merchant would never have\r\ngone thither; if he had not been fond of Rhenish wine and sugar, he\r\nnever would have called for any such delicacies; if he had not called\r\nfor them, Miss Ottilia Poots would never have brought them, and partaken\r\nof them; if he had not been rich, she would certainly have rejected all\r\nthe advances made to her by Silverkoop; if he had not been so fond of\r\nRhenish and sugar, he never would have died; and Mrs. Silverkoop would\r\nhave been neither rich nor a widow, nor a wife to Count von Galgenstein.\r\nNay, nor would this history have ever been written; for if Count\r\nGalgenstein had not married the rich widow, Mrs. Catherine would never\r\nhave--\r\n\r\nOh, my dear madam! you thought we were going to tell you. Pooh!\r\nnonsense!--no such thing! not for two or three and seventy pages or\r\nso,--when, perhaps, you MAY know what Mrs. Catherine never would have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember, in the second chapter of these Memoirs, the\r\nannouncement that Mrs. Catherine had given to the world a child, who\r\nmight bear, if he chose, the arms of Galgenstein, with the further\r\nadornment of a bar-sinister. This child had been put out to nurse some\r\ntime before its mother's elopement from the Count; and as that nobleman\r\nwas in funds at the time (having had that success at play which we duly\r\nchronicled), he paid a sum of no less than twenty guineas, which was to\r\nbe the yearly reward of the nurse into whose charge the boy was put. The\r\nwoman grew fond of the brat; and when, after the first year, she had no\r\nfurther news or remittances from father or mother, she determined, for\r\na while at least, to maintain the infant at her own expense; for, when\r\nrebuked by her neighbours on this score, she stoutly swore that no\r\nparents could ever desert their children, and that some day or other she\r\nshould not fail to be rewarded for her trouble with this one.\r\n\r\nUnder this strange mental hallucination poor Goody Billings, who had\r\nfive children and a husband of her own, continued to give food and\r\nshelter to little Tom for a period of no less than seven years; and\r\nthough it must be acknowledged that the young gentleman did not in the\r\nslightest degree merit the kindnesses shown to him, Goody Billings, who\r\nwas of a very soft and pitiful disposition, continued to bestow them\r\nupon him: because, she said, he was lonely and unprotected, and deserved\r\nthem more than other children who had fathers and mothers to look after\r\nthem. If, then, any difference was made between Tom's treatment and that\r\nof her own brood, it was considerably in favour of the former; to whom\r\nthe largest proportions of treacle were allotted for his bread, and\r\nthe handsomest supplies of hasty pudding. Besides, to do Mrs. Billings\r\njustice, there WAS a party against him; and that consisted not only of\r\nher husband and her five children, but of every single person in the\r\nneighbourhood who had an opportunity of seeing and becoming acquainted\r\nwith Master Tom.\r\n\r\nA celebrated philosopher--I think Miss Edgeworth--has broached the\r\nconsolatory doctrine, that in intellect and disposition all human beings\r\nare entirely equal, and that circumstance and education are the causes\r\nof the distinctions and divisions which afterwards unhappily take place\r\namong them. Not to argue this question, which places Jack Howard and\r\nJack Thurtell on an exact level,--which would have us to believe that\r\nLord Melbourne is by natural gifts and excellences a man as honest,\r\nbrave, and far-sighted as the Duke of Wellington,--which would make out\r\nthat Lord Lyndhurst is, in point of principle, eloquence, and political\r\nhonesty, no better than Mr. O'Connell,--not, I say, arguing this\r\ndoctrine, let us simply state that Master Thomas Billings (for, having\r\nno other, he took the name of the worthy people who adopted him) was in\r\nhis long-coats fearfully passionate, screaming and roaring perpetually,\r\nand showing all the ill that he COULD show. At the age of two, when\r\nhis strength enabled him to toddle abroad, his favourite resort was\r\nthe coal-hole or the dung-heap: his roarings had not diminished in the\r\nleast, and he had added to his former virtues two new ones,--a love\r\nof fighting and stealing; both which amiable qualities he had many\r\nopportunities of exercising every day. He fought his little adoptive\r\nbrothers and sisters; he kicked and cuffed his father and mother; he\r\nfought the cat, stamped upon the kittens, was worsted in a severe battle\r\nwith the hen in the backyard; but, in revenge, nearly beat a little\r\nsucking-pig to death, whom he caught alone and rambling near his\r\nfavourite haunt, the dung-hill. As for stealing, he stole the eggs,\r\nwhich he perforated and emptied; the butter, which he ate with or\r\nwithout bread, as he could find it; the sugar, which he cunningly\r\nsecreted in the leaves of a \xe2\x80\x9cBaker's Chronicle,\xe2\x80\x9d that nobody in the\r\nestablishment could read; and thus from the pages of history he used to\r\nsuck in all he knew--thieving and lying namely; in which, for his years,\r\nhe made wonderful progress. If any followers of Miss Edgeworth and the\r\nphilosophers are inclined to disbelieve this statement, or to set it\r\ndown as overcharged and distorted, let them be assured that just this\r\nvery picture was, of all the pictures in the world, taken from nature.\r\nI, Ikey Solomons, once had a dear little brother who could steal before\r\nhe could walk (and this not from encouragement,--for, if you know the\r\nworld, you must know that in families of our profession the point of\r\nhonour is sacred at home,--but from pure nature)--who could steal, I\r\nsay, before he could walk, and lie before he could speak; and who, at\r\nfour and a half years of age, having attacked my sister Rebecca on some\r\nquestion of lollipops, had smitten her on the elbow with a fire-shovel,\r\napologising to us by saying simply, \xe2\x80\x9c---- her, I wish it had been her\r\nhead!\xe2\x80\x9d Dear, dear Aminadab! I think of you, and laugh these philosophers\r\nto scorn. Nature made you for that career which you fulfilled: you\r\nwere from your birth to your dying a scoundrel; you COULDN'T have been\r\nanything else, however your lot was cast; and blessed it was that you\r\nwere born among the prigs,--for had you been of any other profession,\r\nalas! alas! what ills might you have done! As I have heard the author of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichelieu,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSiamese Twins,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. say \xe2\x80\x9cPoeta nascitur non fit,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nmeans that though he had tried ever so much to be a poet, it was all\r\nmoonshine: in the like manner, I say, \xe2\x80\x9cROAGUS nascitur, non fit.\xe2\x80\x9d We\r\nhave it from nature, and so a fig for Miss Edgeworth.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, then, while his father, blessed with a wealthy wife, was\r\nleading, in a fine house, the life of a galley-slave; while his mother,\r\nmarried to Mr. Hayes, and made an honest women of, as the saying is, was\r\npassing her time respectably in Warwickshire, Mr. Thomas Billings\r\nwas inhabiting the same county, not cared for by either of them; but\r\nordained by Fate to join them one day, and have a mighty influence upon\r\nthe fortunes of both. For, as it has often happened to the traveller in\r\nthe York or the Exeter coach to fall snugly asleep in his corner, and on\r\nawaking suddenly to find himself sixty or seventy miles from the place\r\nwhere Somnus first visited him: as, we say, although you sit still,\r\nTime, poor wretch, keeps perpetually running on, and so must run day\r\nand night, with never a pause or a halt of five minutes to get a drink,\r\nuntil his dying day; let the reader imagine that since he left Mrs.\r\nHayes and all the other worthy personages of this history, in the last\r\nchapter, seven years have sped away; during which, all our heroes and\r\nheroines have been accomplishing their destinies.\r\n\r\nSeven years of country carpentering, or rather trading, on the part of a\r\nhusband, of ceaseless scolding, violence, and discontent on the part of\r\na wife, are not pleasant to describe: so we shall omit altogether\r\nany account of the early married life of Mr. and Mrs. John Hayes. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNewgate Calendar\xe2\x80\x9d (to which excellent compilation we and the OTHER\r\npopular novelists of the day can never be sufficiently grateful) states\r\nthat Hayes left his house three or four times during this period, and,\r\nurged by the restless humours of his wife, tried several professions:\r\nreturning, however, as he grew weary of each, to his wife and his\r\npaternal home. After a certain time his parents died, and by their\r\ndemise he succeeded to a small property, and the carpentering business,\r\nwhich he for some time followed.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, in the meanwhile, had become of Captain Wood, or Brock,\r\nand Ensign Macshane?--the only persons now to be accounted for in our\r\ncatalogue. For about six months after their capture and release of\r\nMr. Hayes, those noble gentlemen had followed, with much prudence and\r\nsuccess, that trade which the celebrated and polite Duval, the ingenious\r\nSheppard, the dauntless Turpin, and indeed many other heroes of our most\r\npopular novels, had pursued,--or were pursuing, in their time. And so\r\nconsiderable were said to be Captain Wood's gains, that reports were\r\nabroad of his having somewhere a buried treasure; to which he might have\r\nadded more, had not Fate suddenly cut short his career as a prig. He\r\nand the Ensign were--shame to say--transported for stealing three\r\npewter-pots off a railing at Exeter; and not being known in the town,\r\nwhich they had only reached that morning, they were detained by\r\nno further charges, but simply condemned on this one. For this\r\nmisdemeanour, Her Majesty's Government vindictively sent them for seven\r\nyears beyond the sea; and, as the fashion then was, sold the use of\r\ntheir bodies to Virginian planters during that space of time. It is\r\nthus, alas! that the strong are always used to deal with the weak, and\r\nmany an honest fellow has been led to rue his unfortunate difference\r\nwith the law.\r\n\r\nThus, then, we have settled all scores. The Count is in Holland with his\r\nwife; Mrs. Cat in Warwickshire along with her excellent husband; Master\r\nThomas Billings with his adoptive parents in the same county; and the\r\ntwo military gentlemen watching the progress and cultivation of the\r\ntobacco and cotton plant in the New World. All these things having\r\npassed between the acts, dingaring-a-dingaring-a-dingledingleding, the\r\ndrop draws up, and the next act begins. By the way, the play ENDS with a\r\ndrop: but that is neither here nor there.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n(Here, as in a theatre, the orchestra is supposed to play something\r\nmelodious. The people get up, shake themselves, yawn, and settle down\r\nin their seats again. \xe2\x80\x9cPorter, ale, ginger-beer, cider,\xe2\x80\x9d comes round,\r\nsqueezing through the legs of the gentlemen in the pit. Nobody takes\r\nanything, as usual; and lo! the curtain rises again. \xe2\x80\x9cSh, 'shsh,\r\n'shshshhh! Hats off!\xe2\x80\x9d says everybody.)\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes had now been for six years the adored wife of Mr. Hayes, and\r\nno offspring had arisen to bless their loves and perpetuate their name.\r\nShe had obtained a complete mastery over her lord and master; and\r\nhaving had, as far as was in that gentleman's power, every single wish\r\ngratified that she could demand, in the way of dress, treats to Coventry\r\nand Birmingham, drink, and what not--for, though a hard man, John Hayes\r\nhad learned to spend his money pretty freely on himself and her--having\r\nhad all her wishes gratified, it was natural that she should begin to\r\nfind out some more; and the next whim she hit upon was to be restored\r\nto her child. It may be as well to state that she had never informed her\r\nhusband of the existence of that phenomenon, although he was aware\r\nof his wife's former connection with the Count,--Mrs. Hayes, in their\r\nmatrimonial quarrels, invariably taunting him with accounts of her\r\nformer splendour and happiness, and with his own meanness of taste in\r\ncondescending to take up with his Excellency's leavings.\r\n\r\nShe determined, then (but as yet had not confided her determination\r\nto her husband), she would have her boy; although in her seven years'\r\nresidence within twenty miles of him she had never once thought of\r\nseeing him: and the kind reader knows that when his excellent lady\r\ndetermines on a thing--a shawl, or an opera-box, or a new carriage, or\r\ntwenty-four singing-lessons from Tamburini, or a night at the \xe2\x80\x9cEagle\r\nTavern,\xe2\x80\x9d City Road, or a ride in a 'bus to Richmond and tea and\r\nbrandy-and-water at \xe2\x80\x9cRose Cottage Hotel\xe2\x80\x9d--the reader, high or low, knows\r\nthat when Mrs. Reader desires a thing have it she will; you may just as\r\nwell talk of avoiding her as of avoiding gout, bills, or grey hairs--and\r\nthat, you know, is impossible. I, for my part, have had all three--ay,\r\nand a wife too.\r\n\r\nI say that when a woman is resolved on a thing, happen it will; if\r\nhusbands refuse, Fate will interfere (flectere si nequeo, etc.; but\r\nquotations are odious). And some hidden power was working in the case of\r\nMrs. Hayes, and, for its own awful purposes, lending her its aid.\r\n\r\nWho has not felt how he works--the dreadful conquering Spirit of\r\nIll? Who cannot see, in the circle of his own society, the fated and\r\nforedoomed to woe and evil? Some call the doctrine of destiny a dark\r\ncreed; but, for me, I would fain try and think it a consolatory one. It\r\nis better, with all one's sins upon one's head, to deem oneself in\r\nthe hands of Fate, than to think--with our fierce passions and weak\r\nrepentances; with our resolves so loud, so vain, so ludicrously,\r\ndespicably weak and frail; with our dim, wavering, wretched conceits\r\nabout virtue, and our irresistible propensity to wrong,--that we are the\r\nworkers of our future sorrow or happiness. If we depend on our strength,\r\nwhat is it against mighty circumstance? If we look to ourselves, what\r\nhope have we? Look back at the whole of your life, and see how Fate has\r\nmastered you and it. Think of your disappointments and your successes.\r\nHas YOUR striving influenced one or the other? A fit of indigestion puts\r\nitself between you and honours and reputation; an apple plops on your\r\nnose and makes you a world's wonder and glory; a fit of poverty makes a\r\nrascal of you, who were, and are still, an honest man; clubs, trumps,\r\nor six lucky mains at dice, make an honest man for life of you, who ever\r\nwere, will be, and are a rascal. Who sends the illness? who causes the\r\napple to fall? who deprives you of your worldly goods? or who shuffles\r\nthe cards, and brings trumps, honour, virtue, and prosperity back again?\r\nYou call it chance; ay, and so it is chance that when the floor\r\ngives way, and the rope stretches tight, the poor wretch before St.\r\nSepulchre's clock dies. Only with us, clear-sighted mortals as we are,\r\nwe can't SEE the rope by which we hang, and know not when or how the\r\ndrop may fall.\r\n\r\nBut revenons a nos moutons: let us return to that sweet lamb Master\r\nThomas, and the milk-white ewe Mrs. Cat. Seven years had passed away,\r\nand she began to think that she should very much like to see her child\r\nonce more. It was written that she should; and you shall hear how, soon\r\nafter, without any great exertions of hers, back he came to her.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, in the year 1715, there came down a road about\r\nten miles from the city of Worcester, two gentlemen; not mounted,\r\nTemplar-like, upon one horse, but having a horse between them--a sorry\r\nbay, with a sorry saddle, and a large pack behind it; on which each by\r\nturn took a ride. Of the two, one was a man of excessive stature, with\r\nred hair, a very prominent nose, and a faded military dress; while the\r\nother, an old weather-beaten, sober-looking personage, wore the\r\ncostume of a civilian--both man and dress appearing to have reached the\r\nautumnal, or seedy state. However, the pair seemed, in spite of their\r\napparent poverty, to be passably merry. The old gentleman rode the\r\nhorse; and had, in the course of their journey, ridden him two miles at\r\nleast in every three. The tall one walked with immense strides by his\r\nside; and seemed, indeed, as if he could have quickly outstripped\r\nthe four-footed animal, had he chosen to exert his speed, or had not\r\naffection for his comrade retained him at his stirrup.\r\n\r\nA short time previously the horse had cast a shoe; and this the tall\r\nman on foot had gathered up, and was holding in his hand: it having been\r\nvoted that the first blacksmith to whose shop they should come should be\r\ncalled upon to fit it again upon the bay horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remimber this counthry, Meejor?\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall man, who was\r\nlooking about him very much pleased, and sucking a flower. \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nthim green cornfields is prettier looking at than the d----- tobacky out\r\nyondther, and bad lack to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recollect the place right well, and some queer pranks we played here\r\nseven years agone,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the gentleman addressed as Major. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nremember that man and his wife, whom we took in pawn at the 'Three\r\nRooks'?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the landlady only hung last Michaelmas?\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall man,\r\nparenthetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang the landlady!--we've got all we ever would out of HER, you know.\r\nBut about the man and woman. You went after the chap's mother, and, like\r\na jackass, as you are, let him loose. Well, the woman was that Catherine\r\nthat you've often heard me talk about. I like the wench, ---- her, for\r\nI almost brought her up; and she was for a year or two along with that\r\nscoundrel Galgenstein, who has been the cause of my ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe infernal blackguard and ruffian!\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall man; who, with his\r\ncompanion, has no doubt been recognised by the reader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this Catherine had a child by Galgenstein; and somewhere here\r\nhard by the woman lived to whom we carried the brat to nurse. She was\r\nthe wife of a blacksmith, one Billings: it won't be out of the way to\r\nget our horse shod at his house, if he is alive still, and we may learn\r\nsomething about the little beast. I should be glad to see the mother\r\nwell enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I remimber her?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ensign. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I remimber whisky? Sure I\r\ndo, and the snivelling sneak her husband, and the stout old lady her\r\nmother-in-law, and the dirty one-eyed ruffian who sold me the parson's\r\nhat that had so nearly brought me into trouble. Oh but it was a rare\r\nrise we got out of them chaps, and the old landlady that's hanged too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And here both Ensign Macshane and Major Brock, or Wood, grinned, and\r\nshowed much satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to explain the reason of it. We gave the British\r\npublic to understand that the landlady of the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Rooks,\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nWorcester, was a notorious fence, or banker of thieves; that is, a\r\npurchaser of their merchandise. In her hands Mr. Brock and his companion\r\nhad left property to the amount of sixty or seventy pounds, which was\r\nsecreted in a cunning recess in a chamber of the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Rooks\xe2\x80\x9d known\r\nonly to the landlady and the gentlemen who banked with her; and in\r\nthis place, Mr. Sicklop, the one-eyed man who had joined in the Hayes\r\nadventure, his comrade, and one or two of the topping prigs of the\r\ncounty, were free. Mr. Sicklop had been shot dead in a night attack near\r\nBath: the landlady had been suddenly hanged, as an accomplice in another\r\ncase of robbery; and when, on their return from Virginia, our two\r\nheroes, whose hopes of livelihood depended upon it, had bent their steps\r\ntowards Worcester, they were not a little frightened to hear of the\r\ncruel fate of the hostess and many of the amiable frequenters of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree Rooks.\xe2\x80\x9d All the goodly company were separated; the house was no\r\nlonger an inn. Was the money gone too? At least it was worth while to\r\nlook--which Messrs. Brock and Macshane determined to do.\r\n\r\nThe house being now a private one, Mr. Brock, with a genius that was\r\nabove his station, visited its owner, with a huge portfolio under his\r\narm, and, in the character of a painter, requested permission to take a\r\nparticular sketch from a particular window. The Ensign followed with the\r\nartist's materials (consisting simply of a screwdriver and a crowbar);\r\nand it is hardly necessary to say that, when admission was granted\r\nto them, they opened the well-known door, and to their inexpressible\r\nsatisfaction discovered, not their own peculiar savings exactly,\r\nfor these had been appropriated instantly, on hearing of their\r\ntransportation, but stores of money and goods to the amount of near\r\nthree hundred pounds: to which Mr. Macshane said they had as just and\r\nhonourable a right as anybody else. And so they had as just a right as\r\nanybody--except the original owners: but who was to discover them?\r\n\r\nWith this booty they set out on their journey--anywhere, for they knew\r\nnot whither; and it so chanced that when their horse's shoe came off,\r\nthey were within a few furlongs of the cottage of Mr. Billings, the\r\nblacksmith. As they came near, they were saluted by tremendous roars\r\nissuing from the smithy. A small boy was held across the bellows, two or\r\nthree children of smaller and larger growth were holding him down, and\r\nmany others of the village were gazing in at the window, while a man,\r\nhalf-naked, was lashing the little boy with a whip, and occasioning the\r\ncries heard by the travellers. As the horse drew up, the operator looked\r\nat the new-comers for a moment, and then proceeded incontinently with\r\nhis work; belabouring the child more fiercely than ever.\r\n\r\nWhen he had done, he turned round to the new-comers and asked how he\r\ncould serve them? whereupon Mr. Wood (for such was the name he adopted,\r\nand by such we shall call him to the end) wittily remarked that however\r\nhe might wish to serve THEM, he seemed mightily inclined to serve that\r\nyoung gentleman first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's no joking matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the blacksmith: \xe2\x80\x9cif I don't serve him so\r\nnow, he'll be worse off in his old age. He'll come to the gallows, as\r\nsure as his name is Bill---never mind what his name is.\xe2\x80\x9d And so saying,\r\nhe gave the urchin another cut; which elicited, of course, another\r\nscream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! his name is Bill?\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name's NOT Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d said the blacksmith, sulkily. \xe2\x80\x9cHe's no name; and\r\nno heart, neither. My wife took the brat in, seven years ago, from a\r\nbeggarly French chap to nurse, and she kept him, for she was a good\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x9d (here his eyes began to wink), \xe2\x80\x9cand she's--she's gone now\xe2\x80\x9d (here\r\nhe began fairly to blubber). \xe2\x80\x9cAnd d--- him, out of love for her, I kept\r\nhim too, and the scoundrel is a liar and a thief. This blessed day,\r\nmerely to vex me and my boys here, he spoke ill of her, he did, and\r\nI'll--cut--his--life--out--I--will!\xe2\x80\x9d and with each word honest Mulciber\r\napplied a whack on the body of little Tom Billings; who, by shrill\r\nshrieks, and oaths in treble, acknowledged the receipt of the blows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wood, \xe2\x80\x9cset the boy down, and the bellows a-going;\r\nmy horse wants shoeing, and the poor lad has had strapping enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith obeyed, and cast poor Master Thomas loose. As he\r\nstaggered away and looked back at his tormentor, his countenance assumed\r\nan expression which made Mr. Wood say, grasping hold of Macshane's\r\narm, \xe2\x80\x9cIt's the boy, it's the boy! When his mother gave Galgenstein the\r\nlaudanum, she had the self-same look with her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad she really now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Macshane. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd pree, Meejor, who WAS his\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Cat, you fool!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, upon my secred word of honour, she has a mighty fine KITTEN\r\nanyhow, my dear. Aha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don't DROWN such kittens,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wood, archly; and Macshane,\r\ntaking the allusion, clapped his finger to his nose in token of perfect\r\napprobation of his commander's sentiment.\r\n\r\nWhile the blacksmith was shoeing the horse, Mr. Wood asked him many\r\nquestions concerning the lad whom he had just been chastising, and\r\nsucceeded, beyond a doubt, in establishing his identity with the child\r\nwhom Catherine Hall had brought into the world seven years since.\r\nBillings told him of all the virtues of his wife, and the manifold\r\ncrimes of the lad: how he stole, and fought, and lied, and swore; and\r\nthough the youngest under his roof, exercised the most baneful influence\r\nover all the rest of his family. He was determined at last, he said, to\r\nput him to the parish, for he did not dare to keep him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's a fine whelp, and would fetch ten pieces in Virginny,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the\r\nEnsign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrimp, of Bristol, would give five for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wood, ruminating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not take him?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ensign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wood. \xe2\x80\x9cHis keep, meanwhile, will not be\r\nsixpence a day.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning round to the blacksmith, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Billings,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be surprised, perhaps, to hear that I know everything\r\nregarding that poor lad's history. His mother was an unfortunate lady\r\nof high family, now no more; his father a German nobleman, Count de\r\nGalgenstein by name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Billings: \xe2\x80\x9ca young, fair-haired man, who came here\r\nwith the child, and a dragoon sergeant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount de Galgenstein by name, who, on the point of death, recommended\r\nthe infant to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he pay you seven years' boarding?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings, who was\r\nquite alive at the very idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, sir, not a jot! He died, sir, six hundred pounds in my debt;\r\ndidn't he, Ensign?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix hundred, upon my secred honour! I remember when he got into the\r\nhouse along with the poli--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPsha! what matters it?\xe2\x80\x9d here broke out Mr. Wood, looking fiercely at\r\nthe Ensign. \xe2\x80\x9cSix hundred pounds he owes me: how was he to pay you? But\r\nhe told me to take charge of this boy, if I found him; and found him I\r\nhave, and WILL take charge of him, if you will hand him over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend our Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Billings. And when that youth appeared, scowling,\r\nand yet trembling, and prepared, as it seemed, for another castigation,\r\nhis father, to his surprise, asked him if he was willing to go along\r\nwith those gentlemen, or whether he would be a good lad and stay with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Tom replied immediately, \xe2\x80\x9cI won't be a good lad, and I'd rather go\r\nto ---- than stay with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you leave your brothers and sisters?\xe2\x80\x9d said Billings, looking very\r\ndismal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang my brothers and sisters--I hate 'em; and, besides, I haven't got\r\nany!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you had a good mother, hadn't you, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom paused for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother's gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand you flog me, and I'll go with these men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, go thy ways,\xe2\x80\x9d said Billings, starting up in a passion: \xe2\x80\x9cgo\r\nthy ways for a graceless reprobate; and if this gentleman will take you,\r\nhe may do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some further parley, the conversation ended, and the next morning\r\nMr. Wood's party consisted of three: a little boy being mounted upon the\r\nbay horse, in addition to the Ensign or himself; and the whole company\r\nwent journeying towards Bristol.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nWe have said that Mrs. Hayes had, on a sudden, taken a fit of maternal\r\naffection, and was bent upon being restored to her child; and that\r\nbenign destiny which watched over the life of this lucky lady instantly\r\nset about gratifying her wish, and, without cost to herself of\r\ncoach-hire or saddle-horse, sent the young gentleman very quickly to her\r\narms. The village in which the Hayeses dwelt was but a very few miles\r\nout of the road from Bristol; whither, on the benevolent mission above,\r\nhinted at, our party of worthies were bound: and coming, towards the\r\nafternoon, in sight of the house of that very Justice Ballance who had\r\nbeen so nearly the ruin of Ensign Macshane, that officer narrated, for\r\nthe hundredth time, and with much glee, the circumstances which had\r\nthen befallen him, and the manner in which Mrs. Hayes the elder had come\r\nforward to his rescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we go and see the old girl?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Wood. \xe2\x80\x9cNo harm can\r\ncome to us now.\xe2\x80\x9d And his comrade always assenting, they wound their\r\nway towards the village, and reached it as the evening came on. In the\r\npublic-house where they rested, Wood made inquiries concerning the\r\nHayes family; was informed of the death of the old couple, of the\r\nestablishment of John Hayes and his wife in their place, and of the kind\r\nof life that these latter led together. When all these points had been\r\nimparted to him, he ruminated much: an expression of sublime triumph and\r\nexultation at length lighted up his features. \xe2\x80\x9cI think, Tim,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at\r\nlast, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we can make more than five pieces of that boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in coorse!\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy Macshane, Esquire; who always agreed with\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9cMeejor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn coorse, you fool! and how? I'll tell you how. This Hayes is well to\r\ndo in the world, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we'll nab him again--ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d roared out Macshane. \xe2\x80\x9cBy my secred\r\nhonour, Meejor, there never was a gineral like you at a strathyjam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, you bellowing donkey, and don't wake the child. The man is well\r\nto do, his wife rules him, and they have no children. Now, either she\r\nwill be very glad to have the boy back again, and pay for the finding of\r\nhim, or else she has said nothing about him, and will pay us for being\r\nsilent too: or, at any rate, Hayes himself will be ashamed at finding\r\nhis wife the mother of a child a year older than his marriage, and will\r\npay for the keeping of the brat away. There's profit, my dear, in any\r\none of the cases, or my name's not Peter Brock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the Ensign understood this wondrous argument, he would fain have\r\nfallen on his knees and worshipped his friend and guide. They began\r\noperations, almost immediately, by an attack on Mrs. Hayes. On hearing,\r\nas she did in private interview with the ex-corporal the next morning,\r\nthat her son was found, she was agitated by both of the passions which\r\nWood attributed to her. She longed to have the boy back, and would give\r\nany reasonable sum to see him; but she dreaded exposure, and would pay\r\nequally to avoid that. How could she gain the one point and escape the\r\nother?\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes hit upon an expedient which, I am given to understand, is not\r\nuncommon nowadays. She suddenly discovered that she had a dear brother,\r\nwho had been obliged to fly the country in consequence of having joined\r\nthe Pretender, and had died in France, leaving behind him an only son.\r\nThis boy her brother had, with his last breath, recommended to her\r\nprotection, and had confided him to the charge of a brother officer who\r\nwas now in the country, and would speedily make his appearance; and, to\r\nput the story beyond a doubt, Mr. Wood wrote the letter from her\r\nbrother stating all these particulars, and Ensign Macshane received\r\nfull instructions how to perform the part of the \xe2\x80\x9cbrother officer.\xe2\x80\x9d What\r\nconsideration Mr. Wood received for his services, we cannot say; only\r\nit is well known that Mr. Hayes caused to be committed to gaol a young\r\napprentice in his service, charged with having broken open a cupboard in\r\nwhich Mr. Hayes had forty guineas in gold and silver, and to which none\r\nbut he and his wife had access.\r\n\r\nHaving made these arrangements, the Corporal and his little party\r\ndecamped to a short distance, and Mrs. Catherine was left to prepare\r\nher husband for a speedy addition to his family, in the shape of this\r\ndarling nephew. John Hayes received the news with anything but pleasure.\r\nHe had never heard of any brother of Catherine's; she had been bred at\r\nthe workhouse, and nobody ever hinted that she had relatives: but it\r\nis easy for a lady of moderate genius to invent circumstances; and with\r\nlies, tears, threats, coaxings, oaths, and other blandishments, she\r\ncompelled him to submit.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards, as Mr. Hayes was working in his shop with his lady\r\nseated beside him, the trampling of a horse was heard in his courtyard,\r\nand a gentleman, of huge stature, descended from it, and strode into the\r\nshop. His figure was wrapped in a large cloak; but Mr. Hayes could not\r\nhelp fancying that he had somewhere seen his face before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, I preshoom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cis Misther Hayes, that I have\r\ncome so many miles to see, and this is his amiable lady? I was the\r\nmost intimate frind, madam, of your laminted brother, who died in King\r\nLewis's service, and whose last touching letthers I despatched to you\r\ntwo days ago. I have with me a further precious token of my dear friend,\r\nCaptain Hall--it is HERE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, the military gentleman, with one arm, removed his cloak,\r\nand stretching forward the other into Hayes's face almost, stretched\r\nlikewise forward a little boy, grinning and sprawling in the air, and\r\nprevented only from falling to the ground by the hold which the Ensign\r\nkept of the waistband of his little coat and breeches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't he a pretty boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hayes, sidling up to her husband\r\ntenderly, and pressing one of Mr. Hayes's hands.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nAbout the lad's beauty it is needless to say what the carpenter thought;\r\nbut that night, and for many many nights after, the lad stayed at Mr.\r\nHayes's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. ENUMERATES THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF MASTER THOMAS\r\nBILLINGS--INTRODUCES BROCK AS DOCTOR WOOD--AND ANNOUNCES THE EXECUTION\r\nOF ENSIGN MACSHANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are obliged, in recording this history, to follow accurately that\r\ngreat authority, the \xe2\x80\x9cCalendarium Newgaticum Roagorumque Registerium,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n of which every lover of literature, in the present day knows the value;\r\nand as that remarkable work totally discards all the unities in its\r\nnarratives, and reckons the life of its heroes only by their actions,\r\nand not by periods of time, we must follow in the wake of this mighty\r\nark--a humble cock-boat. When it pauses, we pause; when it runs ten\r\nknots an hour, we run with the same celerity; and as, in order to carry\r\nthe reader from the penultimate chapter of this work unto the last\r\nchapter, we were compelled to make him leap over a gap of seven blank\r\nyears, ten years more must likewise be granted to us before we are at\r\nliberty to resume our history.\r\n\r\nDuring that period, Master Thomas Billings had been under the especial\r\ncare of his mother; and, as may be imagined, he rather increased than\r\ndiminished the accomplishments for which he had been remarkable while\r\nunder the roof of his foster-father. And with this advantage, that while\r\nat the blacksmith's, and only three or four years of age, his virtues\r\nwere necessarily appreciated only in his family circle and among those\r\nfew acquaintances of his own time of life whom a youth of three can be\r\nexpected to meet in the alleys or over the gutters of a small country\r\nhamlet,--in his mothers residence, his circle extended with his own\r\ngrowth, and he began to give proofs of those powers of which in\r\ninfancy there had been only encouraging indications. Thus it was nowise\r\nremarkable that a child of four years should not know his letters, and\r\nshould have had a great disinclination to learn them; but when a\r\nyoung man of fifteen showed the same creditable ignorance, the\r\nsame undeviating dislike, it was easy to see that he possessed much\r\nresolution and perseverance. When it was remarked, too, that, in case of\r\nany difference, he not only beat the usher, but by no means disdained to\r\ntorment and bully the very smallest boys of the school, it was easy to\r\nsee that his mind was comprehensive and careful, as well as courageous\r\nand grasping. As it was said of the Duke of Wellington, in the\r\nPeninsula, that he had a thought for everybody--from Lord Hill to the\r\nsmallest drummer in the army--in like manner Tom Billings bestowed HIS\r\nattention on high and low; but in the shape of blows: he would fight the\r\nstrongest and kick the smallest, and was always at work with one or the\r\nother. At thirteen, when he was removed from the establishment whither\r\nhe had been sent, he was the cock of the school out of doors, and the\r\nvery last boy in. He used to let the little boys and new-comers pass him\r\nby, and laugh; but he always belaboured them unmercifully afterwards;\r\nand then it was, he said, HIS turn to laugh. With such a pugnacious\r\nturn, Tom Billings ought to have been made a soldier, and might have\r\ndied a marshal; but, by an unlucky ordinance of fate, he was made a\r\ntailor, and died a--never mind what for the present; suffice it to say,\r\nthat he was suddenly cut off, at a very early period of his existence,\r\nby a disease which has exercised considerable ravages among the British\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nBy consulting the authority above mentioned, we find that Hayes did\r\nnot confine himself to the profession of a carpenter, or remain long\r\nestablished in the country; but was induced, by the eager spirit of Mrs.\r\nCatherine most probably, to try his fortune in the metropolis; where he\r\nlived, flourished, and died. Oxford Road, Saint Giles's, and Tottenham\r\nCourt were, at various periods of his residence in town, inhabited\r\nby him. At one place he carried on the business of greengrocer and\r\nsmall-coalman; in another, he was carpenter, undertaker, and lender of\r\nmoney to the poor; finally, he was a lodging-house keeper in the Oxford\r\nor Tyburn Road; but continued to exercise the last-named charitable\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nLending as he did upon pledges, and carrying on a pretty large trade,\r\nit was not for him, of course, to inquire into the pedigree of all\r\nthe pieces of plate, the bales of cloth, swords, watches, wigs,\r\nshoe-buckles, etc. that were confided by his friends to his keeping; but\r\nit is clear that his friends had the requisite confidence in him, and\r\nthat he enjoyed the esteem of a class of characters who still live in\r\nhistory, and are admired unto this very day. The mind loves to think\r\nthat, perhaps, in Mr. Hayes's back parlour the gallant Turpin might\r\nhave hob-and-nobbed with Mrs. Catherine; that here, perhaps, the noble\r\nSheppard might have cracked his joke, or quaffed his pint of rum. Who\r\nknows but that Macheath and Paul Clifford may have crossed legs under\r\nHayes's dinner-table? But why pause to speculate on things that might\r\nhave been? why desert reality for fond imagination, or call up from\r\ntheir honoured graves the sacred dead? I know not: and yet, in sooth, I\r\ncan never pass Cumberland Gate without a sigh, as I think of the gallant\r\ncavaliers who traversed that road in old time. Pious priests accompanied\r\ntheir triumphs; their chariots were surrounded by hosts of glittering\r\njavelin-men. As the slave at the car of the Roman conqueror shouted,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember thou art mortal!\xe2\x80\x9d, before the eyes of the British warrior rode\r\nthe undertaker and his coffin, telling him that he too must die! Mark\r\nwell the spot! A hundred years ago Albion Street (where comic Power\r\ndwelt, Milesia's darling son)--Albion Street was a desert. The square of\r\nConnaught was without its penultimate, and, strictly speaking, NAUGHT.\r\nThe Edgware Road was then a road, 'tis true; with tinkling waggons\r\npassing now and then, and fragrant walls of snowy hawthorn blossoms.\r\nThe ploughman whistled over Nutford Place; down the green solitudes of\r\nSovereign Street the merry milkmaid led the lowing kine. Here, then, in\r\nthe midst of green fields and sweet air--before ever omnibuses were,\r\nand when Pineapple Turnpike and Terrace were alike unknown--here stood\r\nTyburn: and on the road towards it, perhaps to enjoy the prospect,\r\nstood, in the year 1725, the habitation of Mr. John Hayes.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning in the year 1725, Mrs. Hayes, who had been abroad\r\nin her best hat and riding-hood; Mr. Hayes, who for a wonder had\r\naccompanied her; and Mrs. Springatt, a lodger, who for a remuneration\r\nhad the honour of sharing Mrs. Hayes's friendship and table: all\r\nreturned, smiling and rosy, at about half-past ten o'clock, from a\r\nwalk which they had taken to Bayswater. Many thousands of people were\r\nlikewise seen flocking down the Oxford Road; and you would rather\r\nhave thought, from the smartness of their appearance and the pleasure\r\ndepicted in their countenances, that they were just issuing from a\r\nsermon, than quitting the ceremony which they had been to attend.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that they had just been to see a gentleman hanged,--a\r\ncheap pleasure, which the Hayes family never denied themselves; and they\r\nreturned home with a good appetite to breakfast, braced by the walk, and\r\ntickled into hunger, as it were, by the spectacle. I can recollect, when\r\nI was a gyp at Cambridge, that the \xe2\x80\x9cmen\xe2\x80\x9d used to have breakfast-parties\r\nfor the very same purpose; and the exhibition of the morning acted\r\ninfallibly upon the stomach, and caused the young students to eat with\r\nmuch voracity.\r\n\r\nWell, Mrs. Catherine, a handsome, well-dressed, plump, rosy woman of\r\nthree or four and thirty (and when, my dear, is a woman handsomer than\r\nat that age?), came in quite merrily from her walk, and entered the\r\nback-parlour, which looked into a pleasant yard, or garden, whereon the\r\nsun was shining very gaily; and where, at a table covered with a nice\r\nwhite cloth, laid out with some silver mugs, too, and knives, all with\r\ndifferent crests and patterns, sat an old gentleman reading in an old\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are at last, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hayes, \xe2\x80\x9cand here's his speech.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She produced the little halfpenny tract, which to this day is sold at\r\nthe gallows-foot upon the death of every offender. \xe2\x80\x9cI've seen a many men\r\nturned off, to be sure; but I never did see one who bore it more like a\r\nman than he did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman addressed as Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9che was as cool and\r\nas brave as steel, and no more minded hanging than tooth-drawing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the drink that ruined him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink, and bad company. I warned him, my dear,--I warned him years ago:\r\nand directly he got into Wild's gang, I knew that he had not a year\r\nto run. Ah, why, my love, will men continue such dangerous courses,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n continued the Doctor, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cand jeopardy their lives for a\r\nmiserable watch or a snuff-box, of which Mr. Wild takes three-fourths of\r\nthe produce? But here comes the breakfast; and, egad, I am as hungry as\r\na lad of twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed, at this moment Mrs. Hayes's servant appeared with a smoking dish\r\nof bacon and greens; and Mr. Hayes himself ascended from the cellar\r\n(of which he kept the key), bearing with him a tolerably large jug\r\nof small-beer. To this repast the Doctor, Mrs. Springatt (the other\r\nlodger), and Mr. and Mrs. Hayes, proceeded with great alacrity. A fifth\r\ncover was laid, but not used; the company remarking that \xe2\x80\x9cTom had very\r\nlikely found some acquaintances at Tyburn, with whom he might choose to\r\npass the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was Master Thomas Billings, now of the age of sixteen: slim,\r\nsmart, five feet ten inches in height, handsome, sallow in complexion,\r\nblack-eyed and black-haired. Mr. Billings was apprentice to a tailor, of\r\ntolerable practice, who was to take him into partnership at the end of\r\nhis term. It was supposed, and with reason, that Tom would not fail\r\nto make a fortune in this business; of which the present head was one\r\nBeinkleider, a German. Beinkleider was skilful in his trade (after\r\nthe manner of his nation, which in breeches and metaphysics--in\r\ninexpressibles and incomprehensibles--may instruct all Europe), but too\r\nfond of his pleasure. Some promissory notes of his had found their way\r\ninto Hayes's hands, and had given him the means not only of providing\r\nMaster Billings with a cheap apprenticeship, and a cheap partnership\r\nafterwards; but would empower him, in one or two years after the young\r\npartner had joined the firm, to eject the old one altogether. So that\r\nthere was every prospect that, when Mr. Billings was twenty-one years\r\nof age, poor Beinkleider would have to act, not as his master, but his\r\njourneyman.\r\n\r\nTom was a very precocious youth; was supplied by a doting mother with\r\nplenty of pocket-money, and spent it with a number of lively companions\r\nof both sexes, at plays, bull-baitings, fairs, jolly parties on the\r\nriver, and such-like innocent amusements. He could throw a main, too, as\r\nwell as his elders; had pinked his man, in a row at Madam King's in the\r\nPiazza; and was much respected at the Roundhouse.\r\n\r\nMr. Hayes was not very fond of this promising young gentleman; indeed,\r\nhe had the baseness to bear malice, because, in a quarrel which occurred\r\nabout two years previously, he, Hayes, being desirous to chastise Mr.\r\nBillings, had found himself not only quite incompetent, but actually at\r\nthe mercy of the boy; who struck him over the head with a joint-stool,\r\nfelled him to the ground, and swore he would have his life. The Doctor,\r\nwho was then also a lodger at Mr. Hayes's, interposed, and restored\r\nthe combatants, not to friendship, but to peace. Hayes never afterwards\r\nattempted to lift his hand to the young man, but contented himself\r\nwith hating him profoundly. In this sentiment Mr. Billings participated\r\ncordially; and, quite unlike Mr. Hayes, who never dared to show his\r\ndislike, used on every occasion when they met, by actions, looks, words,\r\nsneers, and curses, to let his stepfather know the opinion which he had\r\nof him. Why did not Hayes discard the boy altogether? Because, if he\r\ndid so, he was really afraid of his life, and because he trembled\r\nbefore Mrs. Hayes, his lady, as the leaf trembles before the tempest in\r\nOctober. His breath was not his own, but hers; his money, too, had been\r\nchiefly of her getting,--for though he was as stingy and mean as mortal\r\nman can be, and so likely to save much, he had not the genius for\r\nGETTING which Mrs. Hayes possessed. She kept his books (for she had\r\nlearned to read and write by this time), she made his bargains, and she\r\ndirected the operations of the poor-spirited little capitalist. When\r\nbills became due, and debtors pressed for time, then she brought Hayes's\r\nown professional merits into play. The man was as deaf and cold as a\r\nrock; never did poor tradesmen gain a penny from him; never were the\r\nbailiffs delayed one single minute from their prey. The Beinkleider\r\nbusiness, for instance, showed pretty well the genius of the two. Hayes\r\nwas for closing with him at once; but his wife saw the vast profits\r\nwhich might be drawn out of him, and arranged the apprenticeship and the\r\npartnership before alluded to. The woman heartily scorned and spit upon\r\nher husband, who fawned upon her like a spaniel. She loved good cheer;\r\nshe did not want for a certain kind of generosity. The only feeling that\r\nHayes had for anyone except himself was for his wife, whom he held in\r\na cowardly awe and attachment: he liked drink, too, which made\r\nhim chirping and merry, and accepted willingly any treats that his\r\nacquaintances might offer him; but he would suffer agonies when his wife\r\nbrought or ordered from the cellar a bottle of wine.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the Doctor. He was about seventy years of age. He had been\r\nmuch abroad; he was of a sober, cheerful aspect; he dressed handsomely\r\nand quietly in a broad hat and cassock; but saw no company except the\r\nfew friends whom he met at the coffee-house. He had an income of about\r\none hundred pounds, which he promised to leave to young Billings. He was\r\namused with the lad, and fond of his mother, and had boarded with them\r\nfor some years past. The Doctor, in fact, was our old friend Corporal\r\nBrock, the Reverend Doctor Wood now, as he had been Major Wood fifteen\r\nyears back.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has read the former part of this history must have seen that\r\nwe have spoken throughout with invariable respect of Mr. Brock; and that\r\nin every circumstance in which he has appeared, he has acted not only\r\nwith prudence, but often with genius. The early obstacle to Mr. Brock's\r\nsuccess was want of conduct simply. Drink, women, play--how many a brave\r\nfellow have they ruined!--had pulled Brock down as often as his merit\r\nhad carried him up. When a man's passion for play has brought him to be\r\na scoundrel, it at once ceases to be hurtful to him in a worldly point\r\nof view; he cheats, and wins. It is only for the idle and luxurious\r\nthat women retain their fascinations to a very late period; and Brock's\r\npassions had been whipped out of him in Virginia; where much ill-health,\r\nill-treatment, hard labour, and hard food, speedily put an end to them.\r\nHe forgot there even how to drink; rum or wine made this poor declining\r\ngentleman so ill that he could indulge in them no longer; and so his\r\nthree vices were cured.\r\n\r\nHad he been ambitious, there is little doubt but that Mr. Brock, on his\r\nreturn from transportation, might have risen in the world; but he was\r\nold and a philosopher: he did not care about rising. Living was cheaper\r\nin those days, and interest for money higher: when he had amassed about\r\nsix hundred pounds, he purchased an annuity of seventy-two pounds, and\r\ngave out--why should he not?--that he had the capital as well as the\r\ninterest. After leaving the Hayes family in the country, he found them\r\nagain in London: he took up his abode with them, and was attached to the\r\nmother and the son. Do you suppose that rascals have not affections\r\nlike other people? hearts, madam--ay, hearts--and family ties which they\r\ncherish? As the Doctor lived on with this charming family he began to\r\nregret that he had sunk all his money in annuities, and could not, as he\r\nrepeatedly vowed he would, leave his savings to his adopted children.\r\n\r\nHe felt an indescribable pleasure (\xe2\x80\x9csuave mari magno,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.) in watching\r\nthe storms and tempests of the Hayes menage. He used to encourage Mrs.\r\nCatherine into anger when, haply, that lady's fits of calm would last\r\ntoo long; he used to warm up the disputes between wife and husband,\r\nmother and son, and enjoy them beyond expression: they served him for\r\ndaily amusement; and he used to laugh until the tears ran down his\r\nvenerable cheeks at the accounts which young Tom continually brought\r\nhim of his pranks abroad, among watchmen and constables, at taverns or\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, as the party were discussing their bacon and cabbage,\r\nbefore which the Reverend Doctor with much gravity said grace, Master\r\nTom entered. Doctor Wood, who had before been rather gloomy, immediately\r\nbrightened up, and made a place for Billings between himself and Mrs.\r\nCatherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do, old cock?\xe2\x80\x9d said that young gentleman familiarly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow goes it,\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d And so saying, he seized eagerly upon the jug of beer which Mr.\r\nHayes had drawn, and from which the latter was about to help himself,\r\nand poured down his throat exactly one quart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings, drawing breath after a draught which he had\r\nlearned accurately to gauge from the habit of drinking out of pewter\r\nmeasures which held precisely that quantity.--\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings,\r\ndrawing breath, and wiping his mouth with his sleeves, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is very\r\nthin stuff, old Squaretoes; but my coppers have been red-hot since last\r\nnight, and they wanted a sluicing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you like some ale, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hayes, that fond and\r\njudicious parent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA quart of brandy, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Wood. \xe2\x80\x9cYour papa will run down to\r\nthe cellar for it in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll see him hanged first!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Hayes, quite frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, fie, now, you unnatural father!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.\r\n\r\nThe very name of father used to put Mr. Hayes in a fury. \xe2\x80\x9cI'm not his\r\nfather, thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nor nobody else's,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom.\r\n\r\nMr. Hayes only muttered \xe2\x80\x9cBase-born brat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father was a gentleman,--that's more than you ever were!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed\r\nMrs. Hayes. \xe2\x80\x9cHis father was a man of spirit; no cowardly sneak of a\r\ncarpenter, Mr Hayes! Tom has noble blood in his veins, for all he has a\r\ntailor's appearance; and if his mother had had her right, she would be\r\nnow in a coach-and-six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could find my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I think Polly Briggs and\r\nI would look mighty well in a coach-and-six.\xe2\x80\x9d Tom fancied that if his\r\nfather was a count at the time of his birth, he must be a prince now;\r\nand, indeed, went among his companions by the latter august title.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Tom, that you would,\xe2\x80\x9d cried his mother, looking at him fondly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a sword by my side, and a hat and feather there's never a lord at\r\nSt. James's would cut a finer figure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a little more of this talk, in which Mrs. Hayes let the company\r\nknow her high opinion of her son--who, as usual, took care to show\r\nhis extreme contempt for his stepfather--the latter retired to his\r\noccupations; the lodger, Mrs. Springatt, who had never said a word all\r\nthis time, retired to her apartment on the second floor; and, pulling\r\nout their pipes and tobacco, the old gentleman and the young one solaced\r\nthemselves with half-an-hour's more talk and smoking; while the thrifty\r\nMrs. Hayes, opposite to them, was busy with her books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's in the confessions?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings to Doctor Wood. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nwere six of 'em besides Mac: two for sheep, four housebreakers; but\r\nnothing of consequence, I fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's the paper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wood, archly. \xe2\x80\x9cRead for yourself, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Tom looked at the same time very fierce and very foolish; for,\r\nthough he could drink, swear, and fight as well as any lad of his inches\r\nin England, reading was not among his accomplishments. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what,\r\nDoctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9c---- you! have no bantering with me,--for I'm not the\r\nman that will bear it, ---- me!\xe2\x80\x9d and he threw a tremendous swaggering look\r\nacross the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to learn to read, Tommy dear. Look at your mother there over\r\nher books: she keeps them as neat as a scrivener now, and at twenty she\r\ncould make never a stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour godfather speaks for your good, child; and for me, thou knowest\r\nthat I have promised thee a gold-headed cane and periwig on the first\r\nday that thou canst read me a column of the Flying Post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang the periwig!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tom, testily. \xe2\x80\x9cLet my godfather read the\r\npaper himself, if he has a liking for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon the old gentleman put on his spectacles, and glanced over\r\nthe sheet of whity-brown paper, which, ornamented with a picture of\r\na gallows at the top, contained the biographies of the seven unlucky\r\nindividuals who had that morning suffered the penalty of the law. With\r\nthe six heroes who came first in the list we have nothing to do; but\r\nhave before us a copy of the paper containing the life of No. 7, and\r\nwhich the Doctor read in an audible voice.\r\n\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cCAPTAIN MACSHANE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe seventh victim to his own crimes was the famous highwayman, Captain\r\nMacshane, so well known as the Irish Fire-eater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Captain came to the ground in a fine white lawn shirt and nightcap;\r\nand, being a Papist in his religion, was attended by Father O'Flaherty,\r\nPopish priest, and chaplain to the Bavarian Envoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Macshane was born of respectable parents, in the town of\r\nClonakilty, in Ireland, being descended from most of the kings in that\r\ncountry. He had the honour of serving their Majesties King William\r\nand Queen Mary, and Her Majesty Queen Anne, in Flanders and Spain, and\r\nobtained much credit from my Lords Marlborough and Peterborough for his\r\nvalour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut being placed on half-pay at the end of the war, Ensign Macshane\r\ntook to evil courses; and, frequenting the bagnios and dice-houses, was\r\nspeedily brought to ruin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing at this pass, he fell in with the notorious Captain Wood, and\r\nthey two together committed many atrocious robberies in the inland\r\ncounties; but these being too hot to hold them, they went into the west,\r\nwhere they were unknown. Here, however, the day of retribution arrived;\r\nfor, having stolen three pewter-pots from a public-house, they, under\r\nfalse names, were tried at Exeter, and transported for seven years\r\nbeyond the sea. Thus it is seen that Justice never sleeps; but, sooner\r\nor latter, is sure to overtake the criminal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn their return from Virginia, a quarrel about booty arose between\r\nthese two, and Macshane killed Wood in a combat that took place between\r\nthem near to the town of Bristol; but a waggon coming up, Macshane\r\nwas obliged to fly without the ill-gotten wealth: so true is it, that\r\nwickedness never prospers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo days afterwards, Macshane met the coach of Miss Macraw, a Scotch\r\nlady and heiress, going, for lumbago and gout, to the Bath. He at first\r\nwould have robbed this lady; but such were his arts, that he induced\r\nher to marry him; and they lived together for seven years in the town of\r\nEddenboro, in Scotland,--he passing under the name of Colonel Geraldine.\r\nThe lady dying, and Macshane having expended all her wealth, he was\r\nobliged to resume his former evil courses, in order to save himself\r\nfrom starvation; whereupon he robbed a Scotch lord, by name the Lord of\r\nWhistlebinkie, of a mull of snuff; for which crime he was condemned to\r\nthe Tolbooth prison at Eddenboro, in Scotland, and whipped many times in\r\npublick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese deserved punishments did not at all alter Captain Macshane's\r\ndisposition; and on the 17th of February last, he stopped the Bavarian\r\nEnvoy's coach on Blackheath, coming from Dover, and robbed his\r\nExcellency and his chaplain; taking from the former his money, watches,\r\nstar, a fur-cloak, his sword (a very valuable one); and from the latter\r\na Romish missal, out of which he was then reading, and a case-bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bavarian Envoy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom parenthetically. \xe2\x80\x9cMy master, Beinkleider,\r\nwas his Lordship's regimental tailor in Germany, and is now making a\r\nCourt suit for him. It will be a matter of a hundred pounds to him, I\r\nwarrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor Wood resumed his reading. \xe2\x80\x9cHum--hum! A Romish missal, out of\r\nwhich he was reading, and a case-bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy means of the famous Mr. Wild, this notorious criminal was brought\r\nto justice, and the case-bottle and missal have been restored to Father\r\nO'Flaherty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring his confinement in Newgate, Mr. Macshane could not be brought to\r\nexpress any contrition for his crimes, except that of having killed his\r\ncommanding officer. For this Wood he pretended an excessive sorrow,\r\nand vowed that usquebaugh had been the cause of his death,--indeed, in\r\nprison he partook of no other liquor, and drunk a bottle of it on the\r\nday before his death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was visited by several of the clergy and gentry in his cell; among\r\nothers, by the Popish priest whom he had robbed, Father O'Flaherty,\r\nbefore mentioned, who attended him likewise in his last moments (if\r\nthat idolatrous worship may be called attention), and likewise by\r\nthe Father's patron, the Bavarian Ambassador, his Excellency Count\r\nMaximilian de Galgenstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs old Wood came to these words, he paused to give them utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Max?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Mrs. Hayes, letting her ink-bottle fall over her\r\nledgers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, be hanged if it ben't my father!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father, sure enough, unless there be others of his name, and\r\nunless the scoundrel is hanged,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor--sinking his voice,\r\nhowever, at the end of the sentence.\r\n\r\nMr. Billings broke his pipe in an agony of joy. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we'll have the\r\ncoach now, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cand I'm blessed if Polly Briggs shall not\r\nlook as fine as a duchess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolly Briggs is a low slut, Tom, and not fit for the likes of you, his\r\nExcellency's son. Oh, fie! You must be a gentleman now, sirrah; and\r\nI doubt whether I shan't take you away from that odious tailor's shop\r\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this proposition Mr. Billings objected altogether; for, besides Mrs.\r\nBriggs before alluded to, the young gentleman was much attached to his\r\nmaster's daughter, Mrs. Margaret Gretel, or Gretchen Beinkleider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be time to think of that hereafter, ma'am. If\r\nmy pa makes a man of me, why, of course, the shop may go to the deuce,\r\nfor what I care; but we had better wait, look you, for something certain\r\nbefore we give up such a pretty bird in the hand as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe speaks like Solomon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always said he would be a credit to his old mother, didn't I, Brock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried Mrs. Cat, embracing her son very affectionately. \xe2\x80\x9cA credit to her;\r\nay, I warrant, a real blessing! And dost thou want any money, Tom? for\r\na lord's son must not go about without a few pieces in his pocket. And I\r\ntell thee, Tommy, thou must go and see his Lordship; and thou shalt\r\nhave a piece of brocade for a waistcoat, thou shalt; ay, and the\r\nsilver-hilted sword I told thee of; but oh, Tommy, Tommy! have a care,\r\nand don't be a-drawing of it in naughty company at the gaming-houses, or\r\nat the--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA drawing of fiddlesticks, Mother! If I go to see my father, I must\r\nhave a reason for it; and instead of going with a sword in my hand, I\r\nshall take something else in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lad IS a lad of nous,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Doctor Wood, \xe2\x80\x9calthough his mother does\r\nspoil him so cruelly. Look you, Madam Cat: did you not hear what he said\r\nabout Beinkleider and the clothes? Tommy will just wait on the Count\r\nwith his Lordship's breeches. A man may learn a deal of news in the\r\ntrying on of a pair of breeches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so it was agreed that in this manner the son should at first\r\nmake his appearance before his father. Mrs. Cat gave him the piece of\r\nbrocade, which, in the course of the day, was fashioned into a smart\r\nwaistcoat (for Beinkleider's shop was close by, in Cavendish Square).\r\nMrs. Gretel, with many blushes, tied a fine blue riband round his neck;\r\nand, in a pair of silk stockings, with gold buckles to his shoes, Master\r\nBillings looked a very proper young gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Tommy,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, blushing and hesitating, \xe2\x80\x9cshould\r\nMax--should his Lordship ask after your--want to know if your mother is\r\nalive, you can say she is, and well, and often talks of old times. And,\r\nTommy\xe2\x80\x9d (after another pause), \xe2\x80\x9cyou needn't say anything about Mr. Hayes;\r\nonly say I'm quite well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes looked at him as he marched down the street, a long long way.\r\nTom was proud and gay in his new costume, and was not unlike his father.\r\nAs she looked, lo! Oxford Street disappeared, and she saw a green\r\ncommon, and a village, and a little inn. There was a soldier leading a\r\npair of horses about on the green common; and in the inn sat a cavalier,\r\nso young, so merry, so beautiful! Oh, what slim white hands he had; and\r\nwinning words, and tender, gentle blue eyes! Was it not an honour to\r\na country lass that such a noble gentleman should look at her for a\r\nmoment? Had he not some charm about him that she must needs obey when he\r\nwhispered in her ear, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d As she walked towards the lane\r\nthat morning, how well she remembered each spot as she passed it, and\r\nthe look it wore for the last time! How the smoke was rising from the\r\npastures, how the fish were jumping and plashing in the mill-stream!\r\nThere was the church, with all its windows lighted up with gold, and\r\nyonder were the reapers sweeping down the brown corn. She tried to sing\r\nas she went up the hill--what was it? She could not remember; but oh,\r\nhow well she remembered the sound of the horse's hoofs, as they came\r\nquicker, quicker--nearer, nearer! How noble he looked on his great\r\nhorse! Was he thinking of her, or were they all silly words which he\r\nspoke last night, merely to pass away the time and deceive poor girls\r\nwith? Would he remember them,--would he?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCat my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d here cried Mr. Brock, alias Captain, alias Doctor Wood,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere's the meat a-getting cold, and I am longing for my breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they went in he looked her hard in the face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, still at it,\r\nyou silly girl? I've been watching you these five minutes, Cat; and be\r\nhanged but I think a word from Galgenstein, and you would follow him as\r\na fly does a treacle-pot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went in to breakfast; but though there was a hot shoulder of mutton\r\nand onion-sauce--Mrs. Catherine's favourite dish--she never touched a\r\nmorsel of it.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Mr. Thomas Billings, in his new clothes which his mamma\r\nhad given him, in his new riband which the fair Miss Beinkleider had\r\ntied round his neck, and having his Excellency's breeches wrapped in\r\na silk handkerchief in his right hand, turned down in the direction of\r\nWhitehall, where the Bavarian Envoy lodged. But, before he waited\r\non him, Mr. Billings, being excessively pleased with his personal\r\nappearance, made an early visit to Mrs. Briggs, who lived in the\r\nneighbourhood of Swallow Street; and who, after expressing herself with\r\nmuch enthusiasm regarding her Tommy's good looks, immediately asked him\r\nwhat he would stand to drink? Raspberry gin being suggested, a pint of\r\nthat liquor was sent for; and so great was the confidence and intimacy\r\nsubsisting between these two young people, that the reader will be glad\r\nto hear that Mrs. Polly accepted every shilling of the money which Tom\r\nBillings had received from his mamma the day before; nay, could with\r\ndifficulty be prevented from seizing upon the cut-velvet breeches which\r\nhe was carrying to the nobleman for whom they were made. Having paid his\r\nadieux to Mrs. Polly, Mr. Billings departed to visit his father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. INTERVIEW BETWEEN COUNT GALGENSTEIN AND MASTER THOMAS\r\nBILLINGS, WHEN HE INFORMS THE COUNT OF HIS PARENTAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know in all this miserable world a more miserable spectacle than\r\nthat of a young fellow of five or six and forty. The British army, that\r\nnursery of valour, turns out many of the young fellows I mean: who,\r\nhaving flaunted in dragoon uniforms from seventeen to six-and-thirty;\r\nhaving bought, sold, or swapped during that period some two hundred\r\nhorses; having played, say, fifteen thousand games at billiards; having\r\ndrunk some six thousand bottles of wine; having consumed a reasonable\r\nnumber of Nugee coats, split many dozen pairs of high-heeled Hoby boots,\r\nand read the newspaper and the army-list duly, retire from the service\r\nwhen they have attained their eighth lustre, and saunter through the\r\nworld, trailing from London to Cheltenham, and from Boulogne to Paris,\r\nand from Paris to Baden, their idleness, their ill-health, and their\r\nennui. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the morning of youth,\xe2\x80\x9d and when seen along with whole troops\r\nof their companions, these flowers look gaudy and brilliant enough;\r\nbut there is no object more dismal than one of them alone, and in its\r\nautumnal, or seedy state. My friend, Captain Popjoy, is one who has\r\narrived at this condition, and whom everybody knows by his title of\r\nFather Pop. A kinder, simpler, more empty-headed fellow does not exist.\r\nHe is forty-seven years old, and appears a young, good-looking man\r\nof sixty. At the time of the Army of Occupation he really was as\r\ngood-looking a man as any in the Dragoons. He now uses all sorts of\r\nstratagems to cover the bald place on his head, by combing certain\r\nthin grey sidelocks over it. He has, in revenge, a pair of enormous\r\nmoustaches, which he dyes of the richest blue-black. His nose is a good\r\ndeal larger and redder than it used to be; his eyelids have grown flat\r\nand heavy; and a little pair of red, watery eyeballs float in the midst\r\nof them: it seems as if the light which was once in those sickly green\r\npupils had extravasated into the white part of the eye. If Pop's legs\r\nare not so firm and muscular as they used to be in those days when he\r\ntook such leaps into White's buckskins, in revenge his waist is much\r\nlarger. He wears a very good coat, however, and a waistband, which he\r\nlets out after dinner. Before ladies he blushes, and is as silent as a\r\nschoolboy. He calls them \xe2\x80\x9cmodest women.\xe2\x80\x9d His society is chiefly among\r\nyoung lads belonging to his former profession. He knows the best wine\r\nto be had at each tavern or cafe, and the waiters treat him with much\r\nrespectful familiarity. He knows the names of every one of them; and\r\nshouts out, \xe2\x80\x9cSend Markwell here!\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cTell Cuttriss to give us a bottle\r\nof the yellow seal!\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cDizzy voo, Monsure Borrel, noo donny shampang\r\nfrappy,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. He always makes the salad or the punch, and dines\r\nout three hundred days in the year: the other days you see him in a\r\ntwo-franc eating-house at Paris, or prowling about Rupert Street, or St.\r\nMartin's Court, where you get a capital cut of meat for eightpence. He\r\nhas decent lodgings and scrupulously clean linen; his animal functions\r\nare still tolerably well preserved, his spiritual have evaporated long\r\nsince; he sleeps well, has no conscience, believes himself to be a\r\nrespectable fellow, and is tolerably happy on the days when he is asked\r\nout to dinner.\r\n\r\nPoor Pop is not very high in the scale of created beings; but, if you\r\nfancy there is none lower, you are in egregious error. There was once\r\na man who had a mysterious exhibition of an animal, quite unknown to\r\nnaturalists, called \xe2\x80\x9cthe wusser.\xe2\x80\x9d Those curious individuals who desired\r\nto see the wusser were introduced into an apartment where appeared\r\nbefore them nothing more than a little lean shrivelled hideous\r\nblear-eyed mangy pig. Everyone cried out \xe2\x80\x9cSwindle!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cShame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cPatience, gentlemen, be heasy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the showman: \xe2\x80\x9clook at that there\r\nhanimal; it's a perfect phenomaly of hugliness: I engage you never see\r\nsuch a pig.\xe2\x80\x9d Nobody ever had seen. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll keep\r\nmy promise, has per bill; and bad as that there pig is, look at this\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x9d (he showed another). \xe2\x80\x9cLook at this here, and you'll see at once\r\nthat it's A WUSSER.\xe2\x80\x9d In like manner the Popjoy breed is bad enough, but\r\nit serves only to show off the Galgenstein race; which is WUSSER.\r\n\r\nGalgenstein had led a very gay life, as the saying is, for the last\r\nfifteen years; such a gay one, that he had lost all capacity of\r\nenjoyment by this time, and only possessed inclinations without\r\npowers of gratifying them. He had grown to be exquisitely curious and\r\nfastidious about meat and drink, for instance, and all that he wanted\r\nwas an appetite. He carried about with him a French cook, who could not\r\nmake him eat; a doctor, who could not make him well; a mistress, of whom\r\nhe was heartily sick after two days; a priest, who had been a favourite\r\nof the exemplary Dubois, and by turns used to tickle him by the\r\nimposition of penance, or by the repetition of a tale from the recueil\r\nof Noce, or La Fare. All his appetites were wasted and worn; only some\r\nmonstrosity would galvanise them into momentary action. He was in that\r\neffete state to which many noblemen of his time had arrived; who were\r\nready to believe in ghost-raising or in gold-making, or to retire into\r\nmonasteries and wear hair-shirts, or to dabble in conspiracies, or to\r\ndie in love with little cook-maids of fifteen, or to pine for the smiles\r\nor at the frowns of a prince of the blood, or to go mad at the refusal\r\nof a chamberlain's key. The last gratification he remembered to have\r\nenjoyed was that of riding bareheaded in a soaking rain for three hours\r\nby the side of his Grand Duke's mistress's coach; taking the pas of\r\nCount Krahwinkel, who challenged him, and was run through the body for\r\nthis very dispute. Galgenstein gained a rheumatic gout by it, which put\r\nhim to tortures for many months; and was further gratified with the post\r\nof English Envoy. He had a fortune, he asked no salary, and could\r\nlook the envoy very well. Father O'Flaherty did all the duties, and\r\nfurthermore acted as a spy over the ambassador--a sinecure post, for the\r\nman had no feelings, wishes, or opinions--absolutely none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my life, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said this worthy man, \xe2\x80\x9cI care for nothing. You\r\nhave been talking for an hour about the Regent's death, and the Duchess\r\nof Phalaris, and sly old Fleury, and what not; and I care just as much\r\nas if you told me that one of my bauers at Galgenstein had killed a pig;\r\nor as if my lacquey, La Rose yonder, had made love to my mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does!\xe2\x80\x9d said the reverend gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Monsieur l'Abbe!\xe2\x80\x9d said La Rose, who was arranging his master's\r\nenormous Court periwig, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are, helas! wrong. Monsieur le Comte will\r\nnot be angry at my saying that I wish the accusation were true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Count did not take the slightest notice of La Rose's wit, but\r\ncontinued his own complaints.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Abbe, I care for nothing. I lost a thousand guineas t'other\r\nnight at basset; I wish to my heart I could have been vexed about it.\r\nEgad! I remember the day when to lose a hundred made me half mad for\r\na month. Well, next day I had my revenge at dice, and threw thirteen\r\nmains. There was some delay; a call for fresh bones, I think; and would\r\nyou believe it?--I fell asleep with the box in my hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA desperate case, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it had not been for Krahwinkel, I should have been a dead man,\r\nthat's positive. That pinking him saved me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make no doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbe. \xe2\x80\x9cHad your Excellency not run him\r\nthrough, he, without a doubt, would have done the same for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPsha! you mistake my words, Monsieur l'Abbe\xe2\x80\x9d (yawning). \xe2\x80\x9cI mean--what\r\ncursed chocolate!--that I was dying for want of excitement. Not that I\r\ncared for dying; no, d---- me if I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWHEN you do, your Excellency means,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbe, a fat grey-haired\r\nIrishman, from the Irlandois College at Paris.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency did not laugh, nor understand jokes of any kind; he was\r\nof an undeviating stupidity, and only replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, I mean what I say.\r\nI don't care for living: no, nor for dying either; but I can speak as\r\nwell as another, and I'll thank you not to be correcting my phrases as\r\nif I were one of your cursed schoolboys, and not a gentleman of fortune\r\nand blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerewith the Count, who had uttered four sentences about himself (he\r\nnever spoke of anything else), sunk back on his pillows again, quite\r\nexhausted by his eloquence. The Abbe, who had a seat and a table by the\r\nbedside, resumed the labours which had brought him into the room in the\r\nmorning, and busied himself with papers, which occasionally he handed\r\nover to his superior for approval.\r\n\r\nPresently Monsieur la Rose appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a person with clothes from Mr. Beinkleider's. Will your\r\nExcellency see him, or shall I bid him leave the clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Count was very much fatigued by this time; he had signed three\r\npapers, and read the first half-a-dozen lines of a pair of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBid the fellow come in, La Rose; and, hark ye, give me my wig: one\r\nmust show one's self to be a gentleman before these scoundrels.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\ntherefore mounted a large chestnut-coloured, orange-scented pyramid of\r\nhorsehair, which was to awe the new-comer.\r\n\r\nHe was a lad of about seventeen, in a smart waistcoat and a blue riband:\r\nour friend Tom Billings, indeed. He carried under his arm the Count's\r\ndestined breeches. He did not seem in the least awed, however, by\r\nhis Excellency's appearance, but looked at him with a great degree of\r\ncuriosity and boldness. In the same manner he surveyed the chaplain, and\r\nthen nodded to him with a kind look of recognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have I seen the lad?\xe2\x80\x9d said the father. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have it! My good\r\nfriend, you were at the hanging yesterday, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Billings gave a very significant nod with his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI never miss,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a young Turk! And pray, sir, do you go for pleasure, or for\r\nbusiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness! what do you mean by business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I did not know whether you might be brought up to the trade, or\r\nyour relations be undergoing the operation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy relations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings, proudly, and staring the Count full\r\nin the face, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not made for no such thing. I'm a tailor now, but I'm\r\na gentleman's son: as good a man, ay, as his lordship there: for YOU\r\na'n't his lordship--you're the Popish priest you are; and we were very\r\nnear giving you a touch of a few Protestant stones, master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Count began to be a little amused: he was pleased to see the Abbe\r\nlook alarmed, or even foolish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEgad, Abbe,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou turn as white as a sheet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't fancy being murdered, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbe, hastily;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand murdered for a good work. It was but to be useful to yonder poor\r\nIrishman, who saved me as a prisoner in Flanders, when Marlborough would\r\nhave hung me up like poor Macshane himself was yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count, bursting out with some energy, \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking who\r\nthe fellow could be, ever since he robbed me on the Heath. I recollect\r\nthe scoundrel now: he was a second in a duel I had here in the year\r\nsix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlong with Major Wood, behind Montague House,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings. \xe2\x80\x9cI'VE\r\nheard on it.\xe2\x80\x9d And here he looked more knowing than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYOU!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Count, more and more surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray who the devil\r\nARE you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name's Billings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBillings?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come out of Warwickshire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was born at Birmingham town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you, really!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother's name was Hayes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Billings, in a solemn voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas put out to a nurse along with John Billings, a blacksmith; and my\r\nfather run away. NOW do you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, upon honour, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count, who was amused,--\xe2\x80\x9cupon honour,\r\nMr. Billings, I have not that advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, my Lord, YOU'RE MY FATHER!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Billings when he said this came forward to the Count with a\r\ntheatrical air; and, flinging down the breeches of which he was the\r\nbearer, held out his arms and stared, having very little doubt but that\r\nhis Lordship would forthwith spring out of bed and hug him to his heart.\r\nA similar piece of naivete many fathers of families have, I have no\r\ndoubt, remarked in their children; who, not caring for their parents a\r\nsingle doit, conceive, nevertheless, that the latter are bound to show\r\nall sorts of affection for them. His lordship did move, but backwards\r\ntowards the wall, and began pulling at the bell-rope with an expression\r\nof the most intense alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep back, sirrah!--keep back! Suppose I AM your father, do you want\r\nto murder me? Good heavens! how the boy smells of gin and tobacco! Don't\r\nturn away, my lad; sit down there at a proper distance. And, La Rose,\r\ngive him some eau-de-Cologne, and get a cup of coffee. Well, now, go on\r\nwith your story. Egad, my dear Abbe, I think it is very likely that what\r\nthe lad says is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is a family conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbe, \xe2\x80\x9cI had better leave\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for Heaven's sake, no! I could not stand the boy alone. Now, Mister\r\nah!--What's-your-name? Have the goodness to tell your story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Billings was woefully disconcerted; for his mother and he had agreed\r\nthat as soon as his father saw him he would be recognised at once, and,\r\nmayhap, made heir to the estates and title; in which being disappointed,\r\nhe very sulkily went on with his narrative, and detailed many of those\r\nevents with which the reader has already been made acquainted. The Count\r\nasked the boy's mother's Christian name, and being told it, his memory\r\nat once returned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! are you little Cat's son?\xe2\x80\x9d said his Excellency. \xe2\x80\x9cBy heavens, mon\r\ncher Abbe, a charming creature, but a tigress--positively a tigress. I\r\nrecollect the whole affair now. She's a little fresh black-haired woman,\r\na'n't she? with a sharp nose and thick eyebrows, ay? Ah yes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d went\r\non my Lord, \xe2\x80\x9cI recollect her, I recollect her. It was at Birmingham I\r\nfirst met her: she was my Lady Trippet's woman, wasn't she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was no such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings, hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cHer aunt kept the\r\n'Bugle Inn' on Waltham Green, and your Lordship seduced her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeduced her! Oh, 'gad, so I did. Stap me, now, I did. Yes, I made her\r\njump on my black horse, and bore her off like--like Aeneas bore his wife\r\naway from the siege of Rome! hey, l'Abbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe events were precisely similar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbe. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is wonderful\r\nwhat a memory you have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was always remarkable for it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his Excellency. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, where\r\nwas I,--at the black horse? Yes, at the black horse. Well, I mounted\r\nher on the black horse, and rode her en croupe, egad--ha, ha!--to\r\nBirmingham; and there we billed and cooed together like a pair of\r\nturtle-doves: yes--ha!--that we did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this, I suppose, is the end of some of the BILLINGS?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nAbbe, pointing to Mr. Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBillings! what do you mean? Yes--oh--ah--a pun, a calembourg. Fi\r\ndonc, M. l'Abbe.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, after the wont of very stupid people, M. de\r\nGalgenstein went on to explain to the Abbe his own pun. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, but to\r\nproceed,\xe2\x80\x9d cries he. \xe2\x80\x9cWe lived together at Birmingham, and I was going to\r\nbe married to a rich heiress, egad! when what do you think this little\r\nCat does? She murders me, egad! and makes me manquer the marriage.\r\nTwenty thousand, I think it was; and I wanted the money in those days.\r\nNow, wasn't she an abominable monster, that mother of yours, hey, Mr.\r\na--What's-your-name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe served you right!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings, with a great oath, starting\r\nup out of all patience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said his Excellency, quite aghast, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know to whom you\r\nspeak?--to a nobleman of seventy-eight descents; a count of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire; a representative of a sovereign? Ha, egad! Don't stamp,\r\nfellow, if you hope for my protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--n your protection!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings, in a fury. \xe2\x80\x9cCurse you and\r\nyour protection too! I'm a free-born Briton, and no ---- French Papist!\r\nAnd any man who insults my mother--ay, or calls me feller--had better\r\nlook to himself and the two eyes in his head, I can tell him!\xe2\x80\x9d And with\r\nthis Mr. Billings put himself into the most approved attitude of the\r\nCockpit, and invited his father, the reverend gentleman, and Monsieur\r\nla Rose the valet, to engage with him in a pugilistic encounter. The two\r\nlatter, the Abbe especially, seemed dreadfully frightened; but the Count\r\nnow looked on with much interest; and, giving utterance to a feeble kind\r\nof chuckle, which lasted for about half a minute, said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaws off, Pompey! You young hangdog, you--egad, yes, aha! 'pon honour,\r\nyou're a lad of spirit; some of your father's spunk in you, hey? I know\r\nhim by that oath. Why, sir, when I was sixteen, I used to swear--to\r\nswear, egad, like a Thames waterman, and exactly in this fellow's way!\r\nBuss me, my lad; no, kiss my hand. That will do\xe2\x80\x9d--and he held out a very\r\nlean yellow hand, peering from a pair of yellow ruffles. It shook very\r\nmuch, and the shaking made all the rings upon it shine only the more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Billings, \xe2\x80\x9cif you wasn't a-going to abuse me nor\r\nmother, I don't care if I shake hands with you. I ain't proud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Abbe laughed with great glee; and that very evening sent off to his\r\nCourt a most ludicrous spicy description of the whole scene of meeting\r\nbetween this amiable father and child; in which he said that young\r\nBillings was the eleve favori of M. Kitch, Ecuyer, le bourreau de\r\nLondres, and which made the Duke's mistress laugh so much that she vowed\r\nthat the Abbe should have a bishopric on his return: for, with such\r\nstore of wisdom, look you, my son, was the world governed in those days.\r\n\r\nThe Count and his offspring meanwhile conversed with some cordiality.\r\nThe former informed the latter of all the diseases to which he\r\nwas subject, his manner of curing them, his great consideration as\r\nchamberlain to the Duke of Bavaria; how he wore his Court suits, and of\r\na particular powder which he had invented for the hair; how, when he\r\nwas seventeen, he had run away with a canoness, egad! who was afterwards\r\nlocked up in a convent, and grew to be sixteen stone in weight; how\r\nhe remembered the time when ladies did not wear patches; and how the\r\nDuchess of Marlborough boxed his ears when he was so high, because he\r\nwanted to kiss her.\r\n\r\nAll these important anecdotes took some time in the telling, and were\r\naccompanied by many profound moral remarks; such as, \xe2\x80\x9cI can't abide\r\ngarlic, nor white-wine, stap me! nor Sauerkraut, though his Highness\r\neats half a bushel per day. I ate it the first time at Court; but when\r\nthey brought it me a second time, I refused--refused, split me and grill\r\nme if I didn't! Everybody stared; his Highness looked as fierce as\r\na Turk; and that infernal Krahwinkel (my dear, I did for him\r\nafterwards)--that cursed Krahwinkel, I say, looked as pleased as\r\npossible, and whispered to Countess Fritsch, 'Blitzchen, Frau Grafinn,'\r\nsays he, 'it's all over with Galgenstein.' What did I do? I had the\r\nentree, and demanded it. 'Altesse,' says I, falling on one knee, 'I ate\r\nno kraut at dinner to-day. You remarked it: I saw your Highness remark\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I did, M. le Comte,' said his Highness, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had almost tears in my eyes; but it was necessary to come to a\r\nresolution, you know. 'Sir,' said I, 'I speak with deep grief to your\r\nHighness, who are my benefactor, my friend, my father; but of this I\r\nam resolved, I WILL NEVER EAT SAUERKRAUT MORE: it don't agree with me.\r\nAfter being laid up for four weeks by the last dish of Sauerkraut of\r\nwhich I partook, I may say with confidence--IT DON'T agree with me. By\r\nimpairing my health, it impairs my intellect, and weakens my strength;\r\nand both I would keep for your Highness's service.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tut, tut!' said his Highness. 'Tut, tut, tut!' Those were his very\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Give me my sword or my pen,' said I. 'Give me my sword or my pen,\r\nand with these Maximilian de Galgenstein is ready to serve you; but\r\nsure,--sure, a great prince will pity the weak health of a faithful\r\nsubject, who does not know how to eat Sauerkraut?' His Highness was\r\nwalking about the room: I was still on my knees, and stretched forward\r\nmy hand to seize his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'GEHT ZUM TEUFEL, Sir!' said he, in a loud voice (it means 'Go to the\r\ndeuce,' my dear),--'Geht zum Teufel, and eat what you like!' With this\r\nhe went out of the room abruptly; leaving in my hand one of his buttons,\r\nwhich I keep to this day. As soon as I was alone, amazed by his great\r\ngoodness and bounty, I sobbed aloud--cried like a child\xe2\x80\x9d (the Count's\r\neyes filled and winked at the very recollection), \xe2\x80\x9cand when I went back\r\ninto the card-room, stepping up to Krahwinkel, 'Count,' says I, 'who\r\nlooks foolish now?'--Hey there, La Rose, give me the diamond--Yes, that\r\nwas the very pun I made, and very good it was thought. 'Krahwinkel,'\r\nsays I, 'WHO LOOKS FOOLISH NOW?' and from that day to this I was never\r\nat a Court-day asked to eat Sauerkraut--NEVER!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey there, La Rose! Bring me that diamond snuff-box in the drawer of my\r\nsecretaire;\xe2\x80\x9d and the snuff-box was brought. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Count, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I saw you seemed to doubt. There is the button--the very\r\none that came off his Grace's coat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Billings received it, and twisted it about with a stupid air. The\r\nstory had quite mystified him; for he did not dare yet to think his\r\nfather was a fool--his respect for the aristocracy prevented him.\r\n\r\nWhen the Count's communications had ceased, which they did as soon as\r\nthe story of the Sauerkraut was finished, a silence of some minutes\r\nensued. Mr. Billings was trying to comprehend the circumstances above\r\nnarrated; his Lordship was exhausted; the chaplain had quitted the room\r\ndirectly the word Sauerkraut was mentioned--he knew what was coming. His\r\nLordship looked for some time at his son; who returned the gaze with\r\nhis mouth wide open. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count--\xe2\x80\x9cwell, sir? What are you\r\nsitting there for? If you have nothing to say, sir, you had better go. I\r\nhad you here to amuse me--split me--and not to sit there staring!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Billings rose in a fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark ye, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count, \xe2\x80\x9ctell La Rose to give thee five\r\nguineas, and, ah--come again some morning. A nice well-grown young lad,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n mused the Count, as Master Tommy walked wondering out of the apartment;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca pretty fellow enough, and intelligent too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he IS an odd fellow, my father,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mr. Billings, as he\r\nwalked out, having received the sum offered to him. And he immediately\r\nwent to call upon his friend Polly Briggs, from whom he had separated in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nWhat was the result of their interview is not at all necessary to the\r\nprogress of this history. Having made her, however, acquainted with the\r\nparticulars of his visit to his father, he went to his mother's, and\r\nrelated to her all that had occurred.\r\n\r\nPoor thing, she was very differently interested in the issue of it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. SHOWING HOW GALGENSTEIN AND MRS. CAT RECOGNISE EACH OTHER IN\r\nMARYLEBONE GARDENS--AND HOW THE COUNT DRIVES HER HOME IN HIS CARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a month after the touching conversation above related, there was\r\ngiven, at Marylebone Gardens, a grand concert and entertainment, at\r\nwhich the celebrated Madame Amenaide, a dancer of the theatre at Paris,\r\nwas to perform, under the patronage of several English and foreign\r\nnoblemen; among whom was his Excellency the Bavarian Envoy. Madame\r\nAmenaide was, in fact, no other than the maitresse en titre of the\r\nMonsieur de Galgenstein, who had her a great bargain from the Duke de\r\nRohan-Chabot at Paris.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to make a great and learned display here,\r\notherwise the costumes of the company assembled at this fete might\r\nafford scope for at least half-a-dozen pages of fine writing; and we\r\nmight give, if need were, specimens of the very songs and music sung on\r\nthe occasion. Does not the Burney collection of music, at the British\r\nMuseum, afford one an ample store of songs from which to choose?\r\nAre there not the memoirs of Colley Cibber? those of Mrs. Clark, the\r\ndaughter of Colley? Is there not Congreve, and Farquhar--nay, and at a\r\npinch, the \xe2\x80\x9cDramatic Biography,\xe2\x80\x9d or even the Spectator, from which the\r\nobservant genius might borrow passages, and construct pretty antiquarian\r\nfigments? Leave we these trifles to meaner souls! Our business is not\r\nwith the breeches and periwigs, with the hoops and patches, but with the\r\ndivine hearts of men, and the passions which agitate them. What need,\r\ntherefore, have we to say that on this evening, after the dancing, the\r\nmusic, and the fireworks, Monsieur de Galgenstein felt the strange and\r\nwelcome pangs of appetite, and was picking a cold chicken, along with\r\nsome other friends in an arbour--a cold chicken, with an accompaniment\r\nof a bottle of champagne--when he was led to remark that a very handsome\r\nplump little person, in a gorgeous stiff damask gown and petticoat, was\r\nsauntering up and down the walk running opposite his supping-place, and\r\nbestowing continual glances towards his Excellency. The lady, whoever\r\nshe was, was in a mask, such as ladies of high and low fashion wore at\r\npublic places in those days, and had a male companion. He was a lad of\r\nonly seventeen, marvellously well dressed--indeed, no other than the\r\nCount's own son, Mr. Thomas Billings; who had at length received from\r\nhis mother the silver-hilted sword, and the wig, which that affectionate\r\nparent had promised to him.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the month which had elapsed since the interview that\r\nhas been described in the former chapter, Mr. Billings had several times\r\nhad occasion to wait on his father; but though he had, according to her\r\nwishes, frequently alluded to the existence of his mother, the Count had\r\nnever at any time expressed the slightest wish to renew his acquaintance\r\nwith that lady; who, if she had seen him, had only seen him by stealth.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that after Billings had related to her the particulars of\r\nhis first meeting with his Excellency; which ended, like many of the\r\nlatter visits, in nothing at all; Mrs. Hayes had found some pressing\r\nbusiness, which continually took her to Whitehall, and had been prowling\r\nfrom day to day about Monsieur de Galgenstein's lodgings. Four or five\r\ntimes in the week, as his Excellency stepped into his coach, he might\r\nhave remarked, had he chosen, a woman in a black hood, who was looking\r\nmost eagerly into his eyes: but those eyes had long since left off the\r\npractice of observing; and Madam Catherine's visits had so far gone for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nOn this night, however, inspired by gaiety and drink, the Count had been\r\namazingly stricken by the gait and ogling of the lady in the mask. The\r\nReverend O'Flaherty, who was with him, and had observed the figure in\r\nthe black cloak, recognised, or thought he recognised, her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the\r\nwoman who dogs your Excellency every day,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is with that\r\ntailor lad who loves to see people hanged--your Excellency's son, I\r\nmean.\xe2\x80\x9d And he was just about to warn the Count of a conspiracy evidently\r\nmade against him, and that the son had brought, most likely, the mother\r\nto play her arts upon him--he was just about, I say, to show to the\r\nCount the folly and danger of renewing an old liaison with a woman such\r\nas he had described Mrs. Cat to be, when his Excellency, starting\r\nup, and interrupting his ghostly adviser at the very beginning of his\r\nsentence, said, \xe2\x80\x9cEgad, l'Abbe, you are right--it IS my son, and a mighty\r\nsmart-looking creature with him. Hey! Mr. What's-your-name--Tom, you\r\nrogue, don't you know your own father?\xe2\x80\x9d And so saying, and cocking his\r\nbeaver on one side, Monsieur de Galgenstein strutted jauntily after Mr.\r\nBillings and the lady.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that the Count had formally recognised his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, you rogue,\xe2\x80\x9d stopped at this, and the Count came up. He had a white\r\nvelvet suit, covered over with stars and orders, a neat modest wig and\r\nbag, and peach-coloured silk-stockings with silver clasps. The lady\r\nin the mask gave a start as his Excellency came forward. \xe2\x80\x9cLaw, mother,\r\ndon't squeege so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom. The poor woman was trembling in every limb,\r\nbut she had presence of mind to \xe2\x80\x9csqueege\xe2\x80\x9d Tom a great deal harder; and\r\nthe latter took the hint, I suppose, and was silent.\r\n\r\nThe splendid Count came up. Ye gods, how his embroidery glittered in the\r\nlamps! What a royal exhalation of musk and bergamot came from his wig,\r\nhis handkerchief, and his grand lace ruffles and frills! A broad yellow\r\nriband passed across his breast, and ended at his hip in a shining\r\ndiamond cross--a diamond cross, and a diamond sword-hilt! Was anything\r\never seen so beautiful? And might not a poor woman tremble when such\r\na noble creature drew near to her, and deigned, from the height of his\r\nrank and splendour, to look down upon her? As Jove came down to Semele\r\nin state, in his habits of ceremony, with all the grand cordons of his\r\norders blazing about his imperial person--thus dazzling, magnificent,\r\ntriumphant, the great Galgenstein descended towards Mrs. Catherine.\r\nHer cheeks glowed red-hot under her coy velvet mask, her heart thumped\r\nagainst the whalebone prison of her stays. What a delicious storm of\r\nvanity was raging in her bosom! What a rush of long-pent recollections\r\nburst forth at the sound of that enchanting voice!\r\n\r\nAs you wind up a hundred-guinea chronometer with a twopenny\r\nwatch-key--as by means of a dirty wooden plug you set all the waters of\r\nVersailles a-raging, and splashing, and storming--in like manner, and by\r\nlike humble agents, were Mrs. Catherine's tumultuous passions set going.\r\nThe Count, we have said, slipped up to his son, and merely saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ndo, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d cut the young gentleman altogether, and passing round to the\r\nlady's side, said, \xe2\x80\x9cMadam, 'tis a charming evening--egad it is!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nalmost fainted: it was the old voice. There he was, after seventeen\r\nyears, once more at her side!\r\n\r\nNow I know what I could have done. I can turn out a quotation from\r\nSophocles (by looking to the index) as well as another: I can throw off\r\na bit of fine writing too, with passion, similes, and a moral at the\r\nend. What, pray, is the last sentence but one but the very finest\r\nwriting? Suppose, for example, I had made Maximilian, as he stood by the\r\nside of Catherine, look up towards the clouds, and exclaim, in the words\r\nof the voluptuous Cornelius Nepos,\r\n\r\n     'Aenaoi nephelai\r\n     'Arthoomen phanerai\r\n      Droseran phusin euageetoi, k.t.l. [*]\r\n\r\n     * Anglicised version of the author's original Greek text.\r\n\r\nOr suppose, again, I had said, in a style still more popular:--\r\n\r\nThe Count advanced towards the maiden. They both were mute for a\r\nwhile; and only the beating of her heart interrupted that thrilling and\r\npassionate silence. Ah, what years of buried joys and fears, hopes and\r\ndisappointments, arose from their graves in the far past, and in those\r\nbrief moments flitted before the united ones! How sad was that delicious\r\nretrospect, and oh, how sweet! The tears that rolled down the cheek of\r\neach were bubbles from the choked and moss-grown wells of youth; the\r\nsigh that heaved each bosom had some lurking odours in it--memories of\r\nthe fragrance of boyhood, echoes of the hymns of the young heart! Thus\r\nis it ever--for these blessed recollections the soul always has a place;\r\nand while crime perishes, and sorrow is forgotten, the beautiful alone\r\nis eternal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO golden legends, written in the skies!\xe2\x80\x9d mused De Galgenstein, \xe2\x80\x9cye\r\nshine as ye did in the olden days! WE change, but YE speak ever the same\r\nlanguage. Gazing in your abysmal depths, the feeble ratioci--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                           *****\r\n\r\nThere, now, are six columns[*] of the best writing to be found in this\r\nor any other book. Galgenstein has quoted Euripides thrice, Plato once,\r\nLycophron nine times, besides extracts from the Latin syntax and the\r\nminor Greek poets. Catherine's passionate embreathings are of the most\r\nfashionable order; and I call upon the ingenious critic of the X----\r\nnewspaper to say whether they do not possess the real impress of the\r\ngiants of the olden time--the real Platonic smack, in a word? Not that I\r\nwant in the least to show off; but it is as well, every now and then, to\r\nshow the public what one CAN do.\r\n\r\n     (* There WERE six columns, as mentioned by the accurate Mr.\r\n     Solomons; but we have withdrawn two pages and three-\r\n     quarters, because, although our correspondent has been\r\n     excessively eloquent, according to custom, we were anxious\r\n     to come to the facts of the story.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Solomons, by sending to our office, may have the\r\n     cancelled passages.--O.Y.)\r\n\r\nInstead, however, of all this rant and nonsense, how much finer is the\r\nspeech that the Count really did make! \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very fine evening,--egad\r\nit is!\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cegad\xe2\x80\x9d did the whole business: Mrs. Cat was as much in love\r\nwith him now as ever she had been; and, gathering up all her energies,\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is dreadful hot too, I think;\xe2\x80\x9d and with this she made a\r\ncurtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStifling, split me!\xe2\x80\x9d added his Excellency. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, madam, to\r\na rest in an arbour, and a drink of something cool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, drawing back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a drink--a drink by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Billings, who was\r\ntroubled with a perpetual thirst. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, mo--, Mrs. Jones, I mean.\r\nyou're fond of a glass of cold punch, you know; and the rum here is\r\nprime, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady in the mask consented with some difficulty to the proposal of\r\nMr. Billings, and was led by the two gentlemen into an arbour, where she\r\nwas seated between them; and some wax-candles being lighted, punch was\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nShe drank one or two glasses very eagerly, and so did her two\r\ncompanions; although it was evident to see, from the flushed looks of\r\nboth of them, that they had little need of any such stimulus. The Count,\r\nin the midst of his champagne, it must be said, had been amazingly\r\nstricken and scandalised by the appearance of such a youth as Billings\r\nin a public place with a lady under his arm. He was, the reader will\r\ntherefore understand, in the moral stage of liquor; and when he issued\r\nout, it was not merely with the intention of examining Mr. Billings's\r\nfemale companion, but of administering to him some sound correction for\r\nventuring, at his early period of life, to form any such acquaintances.\r\nOn joining Billings, his Excellency's first step was naturally to\r\nexamine the lady. After they had been sitting for a while over their\r\npunch, he bethought him of his original purpose, and began to address a\r\nnumber of moral remarks to his son.\r\n\r\nWe have already given some specimens of Monsieur de Galgenstein's sober\r\nconversation; and it is hardly necessary to trouble the reader with any\r\nfurther reports of his speeches. They were intolerably stupid and dull;\r\nas egotistical as his morning lecture had been, and a hundred times\r\nmore rambling and prosy. If Cat had been in the possession of her sober\r\nsenses, she would have seen in five minutes that her ancient lover was a\r\nninny, and have left him with scorn; but she was under the charm of old\r\nrecollections, and the sound of that silly voice was to her magical.\r\nAs for Mr. Billings, he allowed his Excellency to continue his prattle;\r\nonly frowning, yawning, cursing occasionally, but drinking continually.\r\n\r\nSo the Count descanted at length upon the enormity of young Billings's\r\nearly liaisons; and then he told his own, in the year four, with a\r\nburgomaster's daughter at Ratisbon, when he was in the Elector of\r\nBavaria's service--then, after Blenheim, when he had come over to the\r\nDuke of Marlborough, when a physician's wife at Bonn poisoned herself\r\nfor him, etc. etc.; of a piece with the story of the canoness, which has\r\nbeen recorded before. All the tales were true. A clever, ugly man every\r\nnow and then is successful with the ladies; but a handsome fool is\r\nirresistible. Mrs. Cat listened and listened. Good heavens! she\r\nhad heard all these tales before, and recollected the place and the\r\ntime--how she was hemming a handkerchief for Max; who came round and\r\nkissed her, vowing that the physician's wife was nothing compared\r\nto her--how he was tired, and lying on the sofa, just come home from\r\nshooting. How handsome he looked! Cat thought he was only the handsomer\r\nnow; and looked more grave and thoughtful, the dear fellow!\r\n\r\nThe garden was filled with a vast deal of company of all kinds, and\r\nparties were passing every moment before the arbour where our trio sat.\r\nAbout half-an-hour after his Excellency had quitted his own box and\r\nparty, the Rev. Mr. O'Flaherty came discreetly round, to examine the\r\nproceedings of his diplomatical chef. The lady in the mask was listening\r\nwith all her might; Mr. Billings was drawing figures on the table with\r\npunch; and the Count talking incessantly. The Father Confessor listened\r\nfor a moment; and then, with something resembling an oath, walked away\r\nto the entry of the gardens, where his Excellency's gilt coach, with\r\nthree footmen, was waiting to carry him back to London. \xe2\x80\x9cGet me a chair,\r\nJoseph,\xe2\x80\x9d said his Reverence, who infinitely preferred a seat gratis in\r\nthe coach. \xe2\x80\x9cThat fool,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered he, \xe2\x80\x9cwill not move for this hour.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nreverend gentleman knew that, when the Count was on the subject of the\r\nphysician's wife, his discourses were intolerably long; and took upon\r\nhimself, therefore, to disappear, along with the rest of the Count's\r\nparty; who procured other conveyances, and returned to their homes.\r\n\r\nAfter this quiet shadow had passed before the Count's box, many groups\r\nof persons passed and repassed; and among them was no other than Mrs.\r\nPolly Briggs, to whom we have been already introduced. Mrs. Polly was\r\nin company with one or two other ladies, and leaning on the arm of a\r\ngentleman with large shoulders and calves, a fierce cock to his hat,\r\nand a shabby genteel air. His name was Mr. Moffat, and his present\r\noccupation was that of doorkeeper at a gambling-house in Covent Garden;\r\nwhere, though he saw many thousands pass daily under his eyes, his own\r\nsalary amounted to no more than four-and-sixpence weekly,--a sum quite\r\ninsufficient to maintain him in the rank which he held.\r\n\r\nMr. Moffat had, however, received some funds--amounting indeed, to a\r\nmatter of twelve guineas--within the last month, and was treating Mrs.\r\nBriggs very generously to the concert. It may be as well to say that\r\nevery one of the twelve guineas had come out of Mrs. Polly's own pocket;\r\nwho, in return, had received them from Mr. Billings. And as the reader\r\nmay remember that, on the day of Tommy's first interview with his\r\nfather, he had previously paid a visit to Mrs. Briggs, having under\r\nhis arm a pair of breeches, which Mrs. Briggs coveted--he should now be\r\ninformed that she desired these breeches, not for pincushions, but for\r\nMr. Moffat, who had long been in want of a pair.\r\n\r\nHaving thus episodically narrated Mr. Moffat's history, let us state\r\nthat he, his lady, and their friends, passed before the Count's arbour,\r\njoining in a melodious chorus to a song which one of the society, an\r\nactor of Betterton's, was singing:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis my will, when I'm dead, that no tear shall be shed,\r\n        No 'Hic jacet' be graved on my stone;\r\n      But pour o'er my ashes a bottle of red,\r\n        And say a good fellow is gone,\r\n            My brave boys!\r\n        And say a good fellow is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brave boys\xe2\x80\x9d was given with vast emphasis by the party; Mr. Moffat\r\ngrowling it in a rich bass, and Mrs. Briggs in a soaring treble. As to\r\nthe notes, when quavering up to the skies, they excited various emotions\r\namong the people in the gardens. \xe2\x80\x9cSilence them blackguards!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a\r\nbarber, who was taking a pint of small beer along with his lady. \xe2\x80\x9cStop\r\nthat there infernal screeching!\xe2\x80\x9d said a couple of ladies, who were\r\nsipping ratafia in company with two pretty fellows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDang it, it's Polly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tom Billings, bolting out of the box,\r\nand rushing towards the sweet-voiced Mrs. Briggs. When he reached her,\r\nwhich he did quickly, and made his arrival known by tipping Mrs. Briggs\r\nslightly on the waist, and suddenly bouncing down before her and her\r\nfriend, both of the latter drew back somewhat startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaw, Mr. Billings!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Polly, rather coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cis it you? Who\r\nthought of seeing you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho's this here young feller?\xe2\x80\x9d says towering Mr. Moffat, with his bass\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's Mr. Billings, cousin, a friend of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Polly,\r\nbeseechingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, cousin, if it's a friend of yours, he should know better how to\r\nconduct himself, that's all. Har you a dancing-master, young feller,\r\nthat you cut them there capers before gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d growled Mr. Moffat;\r\nwho hated Mr. Billings, for the excellent reason that he lived upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDancing-master be hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Billings, with becoming spirit: \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou call me dancing-master, I'll pull your nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Mr. Moffat, \xe2\x80\x9cpull my nose? MY NOSE! I'll tell you what,\r\nmy lad, if you durst move me, I'll cut your throat, curse me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Moffy--cousin, I mean--'tis a shame to treat the poor boy so. Go\r\naway, Tommy; do go away; my cousin's in liquor,\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered Madam Briggs,\r\nwho really thought that the great doorkeeper would put his threat into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTommy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Moffat, frowning horribly; \xe2\x80\x9cTommy to me too? Dog,\r\nget out of my ssss---\xe2\x80\x9d SIGHT was the word which Mr. Moffat intended to\r\nutter; but he was interrupted; for, to the astonishment of his friends\r\nand himself, Mr. Billings did actually make a spring at the monster's\r\nnose, and caught it so firmly, that the latter could not finish his\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nThe operation was performed with amazing celerity; and, having concluded\r\nit, Mr. Billings sprang back, and whisked from out its sheath that new\r\nsilver-hilted sword which his mamma had given him. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with\r\na fierce kind of calmness, \xe2\x80\x9cnow for the throat-cutting, cousin: I'm your\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow the brawl might have ended, no one can say, had the two gentlemen\r\nactually crossed swords; but Mrs. Polly, with a wonderful presence of\r\nmind, restored peace by exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush! the beaks, the beaks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Upon which, with one common instinct, the whole party made a rush for\r\nthe garden gates, and disappeared into the fields. Mrs. Briggs knew her\r\ncompany: there was something in the very name of a constable which sent\r\nthem all a-flying.\r\n\r\nAfter running a reasonable time, Mr. Billings stopped. But the great\r\nMoffat was nowhere to be seen, and Polly Briggs had likewise vanished.\r\nThen Tom bethought him that he would go back to his mother; but,\r\narriving at the gate of the gardens, was refused admittance, as he had\r\nnot a shilling in his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI've left,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tommy, giving himself\r\nthe airs of a gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9csome friends in the gardens. I'm with his\r\nExcellency the Bavarian henvy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you had better go away with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gate people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you I left him there, in the grand circle, with a lady; and,\r\nwhat's more, in the dark walk, I have left a silver-hilted sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Lord, I'll go and tell him then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the porters, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou will wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Billings seated himself on a post near the gate, and there consented\r\nto remain until the return of his messenger. The latter went straight\r\nto the dark walk, and found the sword, sure enough. But, instead of\r\nreturning it to its owner this discourteous knight broke the trenchant\r\nblade at the hilt; and flinging the steel away, pocketed the baser\r\nsilver metal, and lurked off by the private door consecrated to the\r\nwaiters and fiddlers.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mr. Billings waited and waited. And what was the\r\nconversation of his worthy parents inside the garden? I cannot say; but\r\none of the waiters declared that he had served the great foreign Count\r\nwith two bowls of rack-punch, and some biscuits, in No. 3: that in the\r\nbox with him were first a young gentleman, who went away, and a lady,\r\nsplendidly dressed and masked: that when the lady and his Lordship were\r\nalone, she edged away to the further end of the table, and they had much\r\ntalk: that at last, when his Grace had pressed her very much, she took\r\noff her mask and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't you know me now, Max?\xe2\x80\x9d that he cried out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own Catherine, thou art more beautiful than ever!\xe2\x80\x9d and wanted to\r\nkneel down and vow eternal love to her; but she begged him not to do so\r\nin a place where all the world would see: that then his Highness paid,\r\nand they left the gardens, the lady putting on her mask again.\r\n\r\nWhen they issued from the gardens, \xe2\x80\x9cHo! Joseph la Rose, my coach!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n shouted his Excellency, in rather a husky voice; and the men who had\r\nbeen waiting came up with the carriage. A young gentleman, who was\r\ndosing on one of the posts at the entry, woke up suddenly at the blaze\r\nof the torches and the noise of the footmen. The Count gave his arm to\r\nthe lady in the mask, who slipped in; and he was whispering La Rose,\r\nwhen the lad who had been sleeping hit his Excellency on the shoulder,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Count, you can give ME a cast home too,\xe2\x80\x9d and jumped\r\ninto the coach.\r\n\r\nWhen Catherine saw her son, she threw herself into his arms, and kissed\r\nhim with a burst of hysterical tears; of which Mr. Billings was at a\r\nloss to understand the meaning. The Count joined them, looking not a\r\nlittle disconcerted; and the pair were landed at their own door, where\r\nstood Mr. Hayes, in his nightcap, ready to receive them, and astounded\r\nat the splendour of the equipage in which his wife returned to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. OF SOME DOMESTIC QUARRELS, AND THE CONSEQUENCE THEREOF.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ingenious magazine-writer, who lived in the time of Mr. Brock and the\r\nDuke of Marlborough, compared the latter gentleman's conduct in battle,\r\nwhen he\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIn peaceful thought the field of death surveyed,\r\n       To fainting squadrons lent the timely aid;\r\n       Inspired repulsed battalions to engage,\r\n       And taught the doubtful battle where to rage\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Addison, I say, compared the Duke of Marlborough to an angel,\r\nwho is sent by Divine command to chastise a guilty people--\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd pleased his Master's orders to perform,\r\n       Rides on the whirlwind, and directs the storm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first four of these novel lines touch off the Duke's disposition\r\nand genius to a tittle. He had a love for such scenes of strife: in the\r\nmidst of them his spirit rose calm and supreme, soaring (like an\r\nangel or not, but anyway the compliment is a very pretty one) on the\r\nbattle-clouds majestic, and causing to ebb or to flow the mighty tide of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut as this famous simile might apply with equal propriety--to a bad\r\nangel as to a good one, it may in like manner be employed to illustrate\r\nsmall quarrels as well as great--a little family squabble, in which two\r\nor three people are engaged, as well as a vast national dispute, argued\r\non each side by the roaring throats of five hundred angry cannon. The\r\npoet means, in fact, that the Duke of Marlborough had an immense genius\r\nfor mischief.\r\n\r\nOur friend Brock, or Wood (whose actions we love to illustrate by the\r\nvery handsomest similes), possessed this genius in common with his\r\nGrace; and was never so happy, or seen to so much advantage, as when he\r\nwas employed in setting people by the ears. His spirits, usually dull,\r\nthen rose into the utmost gaiety and good-humour. When the doubtful\r\nbattle flagged, he by his art would instantly restore it. When, for\r\ninstance, Tom's repulsed battalions of rhetoric fled from his mamma's\r\nfire, a few words of apt sneer or encouragement on Wood's part would\r\nbring the fight round again; or when Mr. Hayes's fainting squadrons of\r\nabuse broke upon the stubborn squares of Tom's bristling obstinacy, it\r\nwas Wood's delight to rally the former, and bring him once more to the\r\ncharge. A great share had this man in making those bad people worse.\r\nMany fierce words and bad passions, many falsehoods and knaveries on\r\nTom's part, much bitterness, scorn, and jealousy on the part of Hayes\r\nand Catherine, might be attributed to this hoary old tempter, whose\r\njoy and occupation it was to raise and direct the domestic storms and\r\nwhirlwinds of the family of which he was a member. And do not let us be\r\naccused of an undue propensity to use sounding words, because we compare\r\nthree scoundrels in the Tyburn Road to so many armies, and Mr. Wood to\r\na mighty field-marshal. My dear sir, when you have well studied the\r\nworld--how supremely great the meanest thing in this world is, and how\r\ninfinitely mean the greatest--I am mistaken if you do not make a strange\r\nand proper jumble of the sublime and the ridiculous, the lofty and the\r\nlow. I have looked at the world, for my part, and come to the conclusion\r\nthat I know not which is which.\r\n\r\nWell, then, on the night when Mrs Hayes, as recorded by us, had been to\r\nthe Marylebone Gardens, Mr. Wood had found the sincerest enjoyment in\r\nplying her husband with drink; so that, when Catherine arrived at home,\r\nMr. Hayes came forward to meet her in a manner which showed he was not\r\nonly surly, but drunk. Tom stepped out of the coach first; and Hayes\r\nasked him, with an oath, where he had been? The oath Mr. Billings\r\nsternly flung back again (with another in its company), and at the same\r\ntime refused to give his stepfather any sort of answer to his query.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old man is drunk, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Mrs. Hayes, as he handed that\r\nlady out of the coach (before leaving which she had to withdraw her hand\r\nrather violently from the grasp of the Count, who was inside). Hayes\r\ninstantly showed the correctness of his surmise by slamming the door\r\ncourageously in Tom's face, when he attempted to enter the house with\r\nhis mother. And when Mrs. Catherine remonstrated, according to her wont,\r\nin a very angry and supercilious tone, Mr. Hayes replied with equal\r\nhaughtiness, and a regular quarrel ensued.\r\n\r\nPeople were accustomed in those days to use much more simple and\r\nexpressive terms of language than are now thought polite; and it would\r\nbe dangerous to give, in this present year 1840, the exact words of\r\nreproach which passed between Hayes and his wife in 1726. Mr. Wood sat\r\nnear, laughing his sides out. Mr. Hayes swore that his wife should not\r\ngo abroad to tea-gardens in search of vile Popish noblemen; to which\r\nMrs. Hayes replied, that Mr. Hayes was a pitiful, lying, sneaking cur,\r\nand that she would go where she pleased. Mr. Hayes rejoined that if she\r\nsaid much more he would take a stick to her. Mr. Wood whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nserve her right.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Hayes thereupon swore she had stood his cowardly\r\nblows once or twice before, but that if ever he did so again, as sure as\r\nshe was born, she would stab him. Mr. Wood said, \xe2\x80\x9cCurse me, but I like\r\nher spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hayes took another line of argument, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe neighbours would\r\ntalk, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that they will, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we care about the neighbours?\r\nDidn't the neighbours talk when you sent Widow Wilkins to gaol? Didn't\r\nthe neighbours talk when you levied on poor old Thomson? You didn't mind\r\nTHEN, Mr. Hayes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness, ma'am, is business; and if I did distrain on Thomson, and\r\nlock up Wilkins, I think you knew about it as much as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'faith, I believe you're a pair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, sir, keep your tongue to yourself. Your opinion isn't asked\r\nanyhow--no, nor your company wanted neither,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Catherine, with\r\nproper spirit.\r\n\r\nAt which remark Mr. Wood only whistled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have asked this here gentleman to pass this evening along with me.\r\nWe've been drinking together, ma'am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we have\xe2\x80\x9d, said Mr. Wood, looking at Mrs. Cat with the most perfect\r\ngood-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, ma'am, that we've been a-drinking together; and when we've been\r\na-drinking together, I say that a man is my friend. Doctor Wood is my\r\nfriend, madam--the Reverend Doctor Wood. We've passed the evening in\r\ncompany, talking about politics, madam--politics and riddle-iddle-igion.\r\nWe've not been flaunting in tea-gardens, and ogling the men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Mrs. Hayes. \xe2\x80\x9cI went with Tom--you know I did: the\r\nboy wouldn't let me rest till I promised to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang him, I hate him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hayes: \xe2\x80\x9che's always in my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's the only friend I have in the world, and the only being I care a\r\npin for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's an impudent idle good-for-nothing scoundrel, and I hope to see him\r\nhanged!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mr. Hayes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, madam, whose carriage was that as\r\nyou came home in? I warrant you paid something for the ride--ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother lie!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Cat, and clutched hold of a supper-knife. \xe2\x80\x9cSay\r\nit again, John Hayes, and, by ------ I'll do for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo for me? Hang me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hayes, flourishing a stick, and perfectly\r\npot-valiant, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think I care for a bastard and a--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence, for the woman ran at him like a savage,\r\nknife in hand. He bounded back, flinging his arms about wildly, and\r\nstruck her with his staff sharply across the forehead. The woman went\r\ndown instantly. A lucky blow was it for Hayes and her: it saved him from\r\ndeath, perhaps, and her from murder.\r\n\r\nAll this scene--a very important one of our drama--might have been\r\ndescribed at much greater length; but, in truth, the author has a\r\nnatural horror of dwelling too long upon such hideous spectacles: nor\r\nwould the reader be much edified by a full and accurate knowledge of\r\nwhat took place. The quarrel, however, though not more violent than many\r\nthat had previously taken place between Hayes and his wife, was about to\r\ncause vast changes in the condition of this unhappy pair.\r\n\r\nHayes was at the first moment of his victory very much alarmed;\r\nhe feared that he had killed the woman; and Wood started up rather\r\nanxiously too, with the same fancy. But she soon began to recover. Water\r\nwas brought; her head was raised and bound up; and in a short time\r\nMrs. Catherine gave vent to a copious fit of tears, which relieved her\r\nsomewhat. These did not affect Hayes much--they rather pleased him, for\r\nhe saw he had got the better; and although Cat fiercely turned upon him\r\nwhen he made some small attempt towards reconciliation, he did not heed\r\nher anger, but smiled and winked in a self-satisfied way at Wood. The\r\ncoward was quite proud of his victory; and finding Catherine asleep, or\r\napparently so, when he followed her to bed, speedily gave himself up to\r\nslumber too, and had some pleasant dreams to his portion.\r\n\r\nMr. Wood also went sniggering and happy upstairs to his chamber. The\r\nquarrel had been a real treat to him; it excited the old man--tickled\r\nhim into good-humour; and he promised himself a rare continuation of\r\nthe fun when Tom should be made acquainted with the circumstances of\r\nthe dispute. As for his Excellency the Count, the ride from Marylebone\r\nGardens, and a tender squeeze of the hand, which Catherine permitted\r\nto him on parting, had so inflamed the passions of the nobleman, that,\r\nafter sleeping for nine hours, and taking his chocolate as usual the\r\nnext morning, he actually delayed to read the newspaper, and kept\r\nwaiting a toy-shop lady from Cornhill (with the sweetest bargain of\r\nMechlin lace), in order to discourse to his chaplain on the charms of\r\nMrs. Hayes.\r\n\r\nShe, poor thing, never closed her lids, except when she would have had\r\nMr. Hayes imagine that she slumbered; but lay beside him, tossing and\r\ntumbling, with hot eyes wide open and heart thumping, and pulse of a\r\nhundred and ten, and heard the heavy hours tolling; and at last the day\r\ncame peering, haggard, through the window-curtains, and found her still\r\nwakeful and wretched.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes had never been, as we have seen, especially fond of her\r\nlord; but now, as the day made visible to her the sleeping figure and\r\ncountenance of that gentleman, she looked at him with a contempt and\r\nloathing such as she had never felt even in all the years of her wedded\r\nlife. Mr. Hayes was snoring profoundly: by his bedside, on his ledger,\r\nstood a large greasy tin candlestick, containing a lank tallow-candle,\r\nturned down in the shaft; and in the lower part, his keys, purse, and\r\ntobacco-pipe; his feet were huddled up in his greasy threadbare clothes;\r\nhis head and half his sallow face muffled up in a red woollen nightcap;\r\nhis beard was of several days' growth; his mouth was wide open, and he\r\nwas snoring profoundly: on a more despicable little creature the sun\r\nnever shone. And to this sordid wretch was Catherine united for ever.\r\nWhat a pretty rascal history might be read in yonder greasy day-book,\r\nwhich never left the miser!--he never read in any other. Of what a\r\ntreasure were yonder keys and purse the keepers! not a shilling they\r\nguarded but was picked from the pocket of necessity, plundered from\r\nneedy wantonness, or pitilessly squeezed from starvation. \xe2\x80\x9cA fool, a\r\nmiser, and a coward! Why was I bound to this wretch?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Catherine:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, who am high-spirited and beautiful (did not HE tell me so?); I\r\nwho, born a beggar, have raised myself to competence, and might have\r\nmounted--who knows whither?--if cursed Fortune had not baulked me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Cat did not utter these sentiments, but only thought them, we\r\nhave a right to clothe her thoughts in the genteelest possible language;\r\nand, to the best of our power, have done so. If the reader examines\r\nMrs. Hayes's train of reasoning, he will not, we should think, fail\r\nto perceive how ingeniously she managed to fix all the wrong upon her\r\nhusband, and yet to twist out some consolatory arguments for her\r\nown vanity. This perverse argumentation we have all of us, no doubt,\r\nemployed in our time. How often have we,--we poets, politicians,\r\nphilosophers, family-men,--found charming excuses for our own\r\nrascalities in the monstrous wickedness of the world about us; how\r\nloudly have we abused the times and our neighbours! All this devil's\r\nlogic did Mrs. Catherine, lying wakeful in her bed on the night of the\r\nMarylebone fete, exert in gloomy triumph.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be confessed, that nothing could be more just than\r\nMrs. Hayes's sense of her husband's scoundrelism and meanness; for if\r\nwe have not proved these in the course of this history, we have proved\r\nnothing. Mrs. Cat had a shrewd observing mind; and if she wanted for\r\nproofs against Hayes, she had but to look before and about her to find\r\nthem. This amiable pair were lying in a large walnut-bed, with faded\r\nsilk furniture, which had been taken from under a respectable old\r\ninvalid widow, who had become security for a prodigal son; the room was\r\nhung round with an antique tapestry (representing Rebecca at the Well,\r\nBathsheba Bathing, Judith and Holofernes, and other subjects from Holy\r\nWrit), which had been many score times sold for fifty pounds, and bought\r\nback by Mr. Hayes for two, in those accommodating bargains which he made\r\nwith young gentlemen, who received fifty pounds of money and fifty of\r\ntapestry in consideration of their hundred-pound bills. Against this\r\ntapestry, and just cutting off Holofernes's head, stood an enormous\r\nominous black clock, the spoil of some other usurious transaction. Some\r\nchairs, and a dismal old black cabinet, completed the furniture of this\r\napartment: it wanted but a ghost to render its gloom complete.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes sat up in the bed sternly regarding her husband. There is,\r\nbe sure, a strong magnetic influence in wakeful eyes so examining a\r\nsleeping person (do not you, as a boy, remember waking of bright summer\r\nmornings and finding your mother looking over you? had not the gaze of\r\nher tender eyes stolen into your senses long before you woke, and cast\r\nover your slumbering spirit a sweet spell of peace, and love, and fresh\r\nspringing joy?) Some such influence had Catherine's looks upon her\r\nhusband: for, as he slept under them, the man began to writhe about\r\nuneasily, and to burrow his head in the pillow, and to utter quick,\r\nstrange moans and cries, such as have often jarred one's ear while\r\nwatching at the bed of the feverish sleeper. It was just upon six, and\r\npresently the clock began to utter those dismal grinding sounds, which\r\nissue from clocks at such periods, and which sound like the death-rattle\r\nof the departing hour. Then the bell struck the knell of it; and with\r\nthis Mr. Hayes awoke, and looked up, and saw Catherine gazing at him.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met for an instant, and Catherine turned away, burning red,\r\nand looking as if she had been caught in the commission of a crime.\r\n\r\nA kind of blank terror seized upon old Hayes's soul: a horrible icy\r\nfear, and presentiment of coming evil; and yet the woman had but looked\r\nat him. He thought rapidly over the occurrences of the last night, the\r\nquarrel, and the end of it. He had often struck her before when angry,\r\nand heaped all kinds of bitter words upon her; but, in the morning, she\r\nbore no malice, and the previous quarrel was forgotten, or, at least,\r\npassed over. Why should the last night's dispute not have the same end?\r\nHayes calculated all this, and tried to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope we're friends, Cat?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I was in liquor last\r\nnight, and sadly put out by the loss of that fifty pound. They'll ruin\r\nme, dear--I know they will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayes did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see the country again, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in his most\r\nwheedling way. \xe2\x80\x9cI've a mind, do you know, to call in all our money? It's\r\nyou who've made every farthing of it, that's sure; and it's a matter of\r\ntwo thousand pound by this time. Suppose we go into Warwickshire, Cat,\r\nand buy a farm, and live genteel. Shouldn't you like to live a lady in\r\nyour own county again? How they'd stare at Birmingham! hey, Cat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this Mr. Hayes made a motion as if he would seize his wife's\r\nhand, but she flung his back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoward!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou want liquor to give you courage, and then\r\nyou've only heart enough to strike women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only in self-defence, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hayes, whose courage had\r\nall gone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tried, you know, to--to--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo STAB you, and I wish I had!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hayes, setting her teeth, and\r\nglaring at him like a demon; and so saying she sprung out of bed. There\r\nwas a great stain of blood on her pillow. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at it,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nblood's of your shedding!\xe2\x80\x9d and at this Hayes fairly began to weep, so\r\nutterly downcast and frightened was the miserable man. The wretch's\r\ntears only inspired his wife with a still greater rage and loathing; she\r\ncared not so much for the blow, but she hated the man: the man to\r\nwhom she was tied for ever--for ever! The bar between her and wealth,\r\nhappiness, love, rank perhaps. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were free,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mrs. Hayes\r\n(the thought had been sitting at her pillow all night, and whispering\r\nceaselessly into her ear)--, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were free, Max would marry me; I know\r\nhe would:--he said so yesterday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nAs if by a kind of intuition, old Wood seemed to read all this woman's\r\nthoughts; for he said that day with a sneer, that he would wager she was\r\nthinking how much better it would be to be a Count's lady than a poor\r\nmiser's wife. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ca Count and a chariot-and-six is\r\nbetter than an old skinflint with a cudgel.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he asked her if\r\nher head was better, and supposed that she was used to beating; and cut\r\nsundry other jokes, which made the poor wretch's wounds of mind and body\r\nfeel a thousand times sorer.\r\n\r\nTom, too, was made acquainted with the dispute, and swore his accustomed\r\nvengeance against his stepfather. Such feelings, Wood, with a dexterous\r\nmalice, would never let rest; it was his joy, at first quite a\r\ndisinterested one, to goad Catherine and to frighten Hayes: though, in\r\ntruth, that unfortunate creature had no occasion for incitements from\r\nwithout to keep up the dreadful state of terror and depression into\r\nwhich he had fallen.\r\n\r\nFor, from the morning after the quarrel, the horrible words and looks\r\nof Catherine never left Hayes's memory; but a cold fear followed\r\nhim--a dreadful prescience. He strove to overcome this fate as a coward\r\nwould--to kneel to it for compassion--to coax and wheedle it into\r\nforgiveness. He was slavishly gentle to Catherine, and bore her fierce\r\ntaunts with mean resignation. He trembled before young Billings, who was\r\nnow established in the house (his mother said, to protect her against\r\nthe violence of her husband), and suffered his brutal language and\r\nconduct without venturing to resist.\r\n\r\nThe young man and his mother lorded over the house: Hayes hardly dared\r\nto speak in their presence; seldom sat with the family except at meals;\r\nbut slipped away to his chamber (he slept apart now from his wife) or\r\npassed the evening at the public-house, where he was constrained to\r\ndrink--to spend some of his beloved sixpences for drink!\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, the neighbours began to say, \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Hayes neglects\r\nhis wife.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHe tyrannises over her, and beats her.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAlways at the\r\npublic-house, leaving an honest woman alone at home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate wretch did NOT hate his wife. He was used to her--fond\r\nof her as much as he could be fond--sighed to be friends with her\r\nagain--repeatedly would creep, whimpering, to Wood's room, when the\r\nlatter was alone, and begged him to bring about a reconciliation. They\r\nWERE reconciled, as much as ever they could be. The woman looked at him,\r\nthought what she might be but for him, and scorned and loathed him with\r\na feeling that almost amounted to insanity. What nights she lay awake,\r\nweeping, and cursing herself and him! His humility and beseeching looks\r\nonly made him more despicable and hateful to her.\r\n\r\nIf Hayes did not hate the mother, however, he hated the boy--hated and\r\nfeared him dreadfully. He would have poisoned him if he had had the\r\ncourage; but he dared not: he dared not even look at him as he sat\r\nthere, the master of the house, in insolent triumph. O God! how the\r\nlad's brutal laughter rung in Hayes's ears; and how the stare of his\r\nfierce bold black eyes pursued him! Of a truth, if Mr. Wood loved\r\nmischief, as he did, honestly and purely for mischief's sake, he had\r\nenough here. There was mean malice, and fierce scorn, and black revenge,\r\nand sinful desire, boiling up in the hearts of these wretched people,\r\nenough to content Mr. Wood's great master himself.\r\n\r\nHayes's business, as we have said, was nominally that of a carpenter;\r\nbut since, for the last few years, he had added to it that of a lender\r\nof money, the carpenter's trade had been neglected altogether for one so\r\nmuch more profitable. Mrs. Hayes had exerted herself, with much\r\nbenefit to her husband, in his usurious business. She was a resolute,\r\nclear-sighted, keen woman, that did not love money, but loved to be rich\r\nand push her way in the world. She would have nothing to do with the\r\ntrade now, however, and told her husband to manage it himself. She felt\r\nthat she was separated from him for ever, and could no more be brought\r\nto consider her interests as connected with his own.\r\n\r\nThe man was well fitted for the creeping and niggling of his dastardly\r\ntrade; and gathered his moneys, and busied himself with his lawyer, and\r\nacted as his own bookkeeper and clerk, not without satisfaction. His\r\nwife's speculations, when they worked in concert, used often to frighten\r\nhim. He never sent out his capital without a pang, and only because he\r\ndared not question her superior judgment and will. He began now to lend\r\nno more: he could not let the money out of his sight. His sole pleasure\r\nwas to creep up into his room, and count and recount it. When Billings\r\ncame into the house, Hayes had taken a room next to that of Wood. It was\r\na protection to him; for Wood would often rebuke the lad for using Hayes\r\nill: and both Catherine and Tom treated the old man with deference.\r\n\r\nAt last--it was after he had collected a good deal of his money--Hayes\r\nbegan to reason with himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I stay?--stay to be insulted\r\nby that boy, or murdered by him? He is ready for any crime.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ndetermined to fly. He would send Catherine money every year. No--she had\r\nthe furniture; let her let lodgings--that would support her. He would\r\ngo, and live away, abroad in some cheap place--away from that boy and\r\nhis horrible threats. The idea of freedom was agreeable to the poor\r\nwretch; and he began to wind up his affairs as quickly as he could.\r\n\r\nHayes would now allow no one to make his bed or enter his room; and\r\nWood could hear him through the panels fidgeting perpetually to and fro,\r\nopening and shutting of chests, and clinking of coin. At the least sound\r\nhe would start up, and would go to Billings's door and listen. Wood used\r\nto hear him creeping through the passages, and returning stealthily to\r\nhis own chamber.\r\n\r\nOne day the woman and her son had been angrily taunting him in the\r\npresence of a neighbour. The neighbour retired soon; and Hayes, who had\r\ngone with him to the door, heard, on returning, the voice of Wood in the\r\nparlour. The old man laughed in his usual saturnine way, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\na care, Mrs. Cat; for if Hayes were to die suddenly, by the laws, the\r\nneighbours would accuse thee of his death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHayes started as if he had been shot. \xe2\x80\x9cHe too is in the plot,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nhe. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are all leagued against me: they WILL kill me: they are only\r\nbiding their time.\xe2\x80\x9d Fear seized him, and he thought of flying that\r\ninstant and leaving all; and he stole into his room and gathered his\r\nmoney together. But only a half of it was there: in a few weeks all\r\nwould have come in. He had not the heart to go. But that night Wood\r\nheard Hayes pause at HIS door, before he went to listen at Mrs.\r\nCatherine's. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the man thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wood. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is gathering\r\nhis money together. Has he a hoard yonder unknown to us all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWood thought he would watch him. There was a closet between the two\r\nrooms: Wood bored a hole in the panel, and peeped through. Hayes had a\r\nbrace of pistols, and four or five little bags before him on the table.\r\nOne of these he opened, and placed, one by one, five-and-twenty guineas\r\ninto it. Such a sum had been due that day--Catherine spoke of it only in\r\nthe morning; for the debtor's name had by chance been mentioned in the\r\nconversation. Hayes commonly kept but a few guineas in the house. For\r\nwhat was he amassing all these? The next day, Wood asked for change\r\nfor a twenty-pound bill. Hayes said he had but three guineas. And, when\r\nasked by Catherine where the money was that was paid the day before,\r\nsaid that it was at the banker's. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man is going to fly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wood;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat is sure: if he does, I know him--he will leave his wife without a\r\nshilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe watched him for several days regularly: two or three more bags were\r\nadded to the former number. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are pretty things, guineas,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nWood, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell no tales, like bank-bills.\xe2\x80\x9d And he thought over the days\r\nwhen he and Macshane used to ride abroad in search of them.\r\n\r\nI don't know what thoughts entered into Mr. Wood's brain; but the next\r\nday, after seeing young Billings, to whom he actually made a present of\r\na guinea, that young man, in conversing with his mother, said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nknow, mother, that if you were free, and married the Count, I should be\r\na lord? It's the German law, Mr. Wood says; and you know he was in them\r\ncountries with Marlborough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that he would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wood, \xe2\x80\x9cin Germany: but Germany isn't\r\nEngland; and it's no use talking of such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hayes, quite eagerly: \xe2\x80\x9chow can _I_ marry the\r\nCount? Besides, a'n't I married, and isn't he too great a lord for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo great a lord?--not a whit, mother. If it wasn't for Hayes, I might\r\nbe a lord now. He gave me five guineas only last week; but curse the\r\nskinflint who never will part with a shilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's not so bad as his striking your mother, Tom. I had my stick up,\r\nand was ready to fell him t'other night,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Wood. And herewith\r\nhe smiled, and looked steadily in Mrs. Catherine's face. She dared not\r\nlook again; but she felt that the old man knew a secret that she had\r\nbeen trying to hide from herself. Fool! he knew it; and Hayes knew it\r\ndimly: and never, never, since that day of the gala, had it left her,\r\nsleeping or waking. When Hayes, in his fear, had proposed to sleep away\r\nfrom her, she started with joy: she had been afraid that she might talk\r\nin her sleep, and so let slip her horrible confession.\r\n\r\nOld Wood knew all her history since the period of the Marylebone fete.\r\nHe had wormed it out of her, day by day; he had counselled her how to\r\nact; warned her not to yield; to procure, at least, a certain provision\r\nfor her son, and a handsome settlement for herself, if she determined\r\non quitting her husband. The old man looked on the business in a proper\r\nphilosophical light, told her bluntly that he saw she was bent upon\r\ngoing off with the Count, and bade her take precautions: else she might\r\nbe left as she had been before.\r\n\r\nCatherine denied all these charges; but she saw the Count daily,\r\nnotwithstanding, and took all the measures which Wood had recommended to\r\nher. They were very prudent ones. Galgenstein grew hourly more in love:\r\nnever had he felt such a flame; not in the best days of his youth; not\r\nfor the fairest princess, countess, or actress, from Vienna to Paris.\r\n\r\nAt length--it was the night after he had seen Hayes counting his\r\nmoney-bags--old Wood spoke to Mrs. Hayes very seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat husband\r\nof yours, Cat,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmeditates some treason; ay, and fancies we are\r\nabout such. He listens nightly at your door and at mine: he is going to\r\nleave you, be sure on't; and if he leaves you, he leaves you to starve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can be rich elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, with Max?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, with Max: and why not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hayes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, fool! Do you recollect Birmingham? Do you think that\r\nGalgenstein, who is so tender now because he HASN'T won you, will be\r\nfaithful because he HAS? Psha, woman, men are not made so! Don't go to\r\nhim until you are sure: if you were a widow now, he would marry you; but\r\nnever leave yourself at his mercy: if you were to leave your husband to\r\ngo to him, he would desert you in a fortnight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe might have been a Countess! she knew she might, but for this cursed\r\nbarrier between her and her fortune. Wood knew what she was thinking of,\r\nand smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cremember Tom. As sure as you leave Hayes\r\nwithout some security from Max, the boy's ruined: he who might be a\r\nlord, if his mother had but--Psha! never mind: that boy will go on\r\nthe road, as sure as my name's Wood. He's a Turpin cock in his eye, my\r\ndear,--a regular Tyburn look. He knows too many of that sort already;\r\nand is too fond of a bottle and a girl to resist and be honest when it\r\ncomes to the pinch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's all true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hayes. \xe2\x80\x9cTom's a high mettlesome fellow, and\r\nwould no more mind a ride on Hounslow Heath than he does a walk now in\r\nthe Mall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want him hanged, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt IS a pity, and that's sure,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Mr. Wood, knocking the ashes\r\nout of his pipe, and closing this interesting conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\npity that that old skinflint should be in the way of both your fortunes;\r\nand he about to fling you over, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Catherine retired musing, as Mr. Billings had previously done; a\r\nsweet smile of contentment lighted up the venerable features of Doctor\r\nWood, and he walked abroad into the streets as happy a fellow as any in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. TREATS OF LOVE, AND PREPARES FOR DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd to begin this chapter, we cannot do better than quote a part of\r\na letter from M. l'Abbe O'Flaherty to Madame la Comtesse de X-----at\r\nParis:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMADAM,--The little Arouet de Voltaire, who hath come 'hither to take a\r\nturn in England,' as I see by the Post of this morning, hath brought me\r\na charming pacquet from your Ladyship's hands, which ought to render a\r\nreasonable man happy; but, alas! makes your slave miserable. I think of\r\ndear Paris (and something more dear than all Paris, of which, Madam,\r\nI may not venture to speak further)--I think of dear Paris, and find\r\nmyself in this dismal Vitehall, where, when the fog clears up, I can\r\ncatch a glimpse of muddy Thames, and of that fatal palace which the\r\nkings of England have been obliged to exchange for your noble castle of\r\nSaint Germains, that stands so stately by silver Seine. Truly, no bad\r\nbargain. For my part, I would give my grand ambassadorial saloons,\r\nhangings, gildings, feasts, valets, ambassadors and all, for a bicoque\r\nin sight of the Thuilleries' towers, or my little cell in the Irlandois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy last sheets have given you a pretty notion of our ambassador's\r\npublic doings; now for a pretty piece of private scandal respecting\r\nthat great man. Figure to yourself, Madam, his Excellency is in love;\r\nactually in love, talking day and night about a certain fair one whom he\r\nhath picked out of a gutter; who is well nigh forty years old; who was\r\nhis mistress when he was in England a captain of dragoons, some sixty,\r\nseventy, or a hundred years since; who hath had a son by him, moreover,\r\na sprightly lad, apprentice to a tailor of eminence that has the honour\r\nof making his Excellency's breeches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince one fatal night when he met this fair creature at a certain place\r\nof publique resort, called Marylebone Gardens, our Cyrus hath been an\r\naltered creature. Love hath mastered this brainless ambassador, and his\r\nantics afford me food for perpetual mirth. He sits now opposite to me at\r\na table inditing a letter to his Catherine, and copying it from--what do\r\nyou think?--from the 'Grand Cyrus.' 'I swear, madam, that my happiness\r\nwould be to offer you this hand, as I have my heart long ago, and I beg\r\nyou to bear in mind this declaration.' I have just dictated to him the\r\nabove tender words; for our Envoy, I need not tell you, is not strong at\r\nwriting or thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fair Catherine, I must tell you, is no less than a carpenter's\r\nwife, a well-to-do bourgeois, living at the Tyburn, or Gallows Road.\r\nShe found out her ancient lover very soon after our arrival, and hath a\r\nmarvellous hankering to be a Count's lady. A pretty little creature is\r\nthis Madam Catherine. Billets, breakfasts, pretty walks, presents of\r\nsilks and satins, pass daily between the pair; but, strange to say,\r\nthe lady is as virtuous as Diana, and hath resisted all my Count's\r\ncajoleries hitherto. The poor fellow told me, with tears in his eyes,\r\nthat he believed he should have carried her by storm on the very first\r\nnight of their meeting, but that her son stepped into the way; and he or\r\nsomebody else hath been in the way ever since. Madam will never appear\r\nalone. I believe it is this wondrous chastity of the lady that has\r\nelicited this wondrous constancy of the gentleman. She is holding out\r\nfor a settlement; who knows if not for a marriage? Her husband, she\r\nsays, is ailing; her lover is fool enough, and she herself conducts\r\nher negotiations, as I must honestly own, with a pretty notion of\r\ndiplomacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nThis is the only part of the reverend gentleman's letter that directly\r\naffects this history. The rest contains some scandal concerning greater\r\npersonages about the Court, a great share of abuse of the Elector\r\nof Hanover, and a pretty description of a boxing-match at Mr. Figg's\r\namphitheatre in Oxford Road, where John Wells, of Edmund Bury (as by the\r\npapers may be seen), master of the noble science of self-defence, did\r\nengage with Edward Sutton, of Gravesend, master of the said science; and\r\nthe issue of the combat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN. B.\xe2\x80\x9d--adds the Father, in a postscript--\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Figue gives a\r\nhat to be cudgelled for before the Master mount; and the whole of\r\nthis fashionable information hath been given me by Monseigneur's son,\r\nMonsieur Billings, garcon-tailleur, Chevalier de Galgenstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Billings was, in fact, a frequent visitor at the Ambassador's house;\r\nto whose presence he, by a general order, was always admitted. As for\r\nthe connection between Mrs. Catherine and her former admirer, the\r\nAbbe's history of it is perfectly correct; nor can it be said that this\r\nwretched woman, whose tale now begins to wear a darker hue, was, in\r\nanything but SOUL, faithless to her husband. But she hated him, longed\r\nto leave him, and loved another: the end was coming quickly, and every\r\none of our unknowing actors and actresses were to be implicated, more or\r\nless, in the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Mrs. Cat had followed pretty closely the\r\ninjunctions of Mr. Wood in regard to her dealings with the Count; who\r\ngrew more heart-stricken and tender daily, as the completion of his\r\nwishes was delayed, and his desires goaded by contradiction. The Abbe\r\nhas quoted one portion of a letter written by him; here is the entire\r\nperformance, extracted, as the holy father said, chiefly from the\r\nromance of the \xe2\x80\x9cGrand Cyrus\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n           \xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy Maximilian unto unjust Catherina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMADAM,--It must needs be that I love you better than any ever did,\r\nsince, notwithstanding your injustice in calling me perfidious, I\r\nlove you no less than I did before. On the contrary, my passion is so\r\nviolent, and your unjust accusation makes me so sensible of it, that\r\nif you did but know the resentments of my soule, you would confess your\r\nselfe the most cruell and unjust woman in the world. You shall, ere\r\nlong, Madam, see me at your feete; and as you were my first passion, so\r\nyou will be my last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my knees I will tell you, at the first handsom opportunity, that\r\nthe grandure of my passion can only be equalled by your beauty; it hath\r\ndriven me to such a fatall necessity, as that I cannot hide the misery\r\nwhich you have caused. Sure, the hostil goddes have, to plague me,\r\nordayned that fatal marridge, by which you are bound to one so infinitly\r\nbelow you in degree. Were that bond of ill-omind Hymen cut in twayn\r\nwitch binds you, I swear, Madam, that my happiniss woulde be to offer\r\nyou this hande, as I have my harte long agoe. And I praye you to beare\r\nin minde this declaracion, which I here sign with my hande, and witch I\r\npray you may one day be called upon to prove the truth on. Beleave\r\nme, Madam, that there is none in the World who doth more honor to your\r\nvertue than myselfe, nor who wishes your happinesse with more zeal\r\nthan--MAXIMILIAN.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my lodgings in Whitehall, this 25th of February.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the incomparable Catherina, these, with a scarlet satten petticoat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Count had debated about the sentence promising marriage in event\r\nof Hayes's death; but the honest Abbe cut these scruples very short, by\r\nsaying, justly, that, because he wrote in that manner, there was no need\r\nfor him to act so; that he had better not sign and address the note in\r\nfull; and that he presumed his Excellency was not quite so timid as to\r\nfancy that the woman would follow him all the way to Germany, when his\r\ndiplomatic duties would be ended; as they would soon.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of this billet caused such a flush of joy and exultation to\r\nunhappy happy Mrs. Catherine, that Wood did not fail to remark it, and\r\nspeedily learned the contents of the letter. Wood had no need to bid the\r\npoor wretch guard it very carefully: it never from that day forth left\r\nher; it was her title of nobility,--her pass to rank, wealth, happiness.\r\nShe began to look down on her neighbours; her manner to her husband grew\r\nmore than ordinarily scornful; the poor vain wretch longed to tell her\r\nsecret, and to take her place openly in the world. She a Countess, and\r\nTom a Count's son! She felt that she should royally become the title!\r\n\r\nAbout this time--and Hayes was very much frightened at the prevalence\r\nof the rumour--it suddenly began to be about in his quarter that he was\r\ngoing to quit the country. The story was in everybody's mouth; people\r\nused to sneer when he turned pale, and wept, and passionately denied it.\r\n\r\nIt was said, too, that Mrs. Hayes was not his wife, but his\r\nmistress--everybody had this story--his mistress, whom he treated most\r\ncruelly, and was about to desert. The tale of the blow which had felled\r\nher to the ground was known in all quarters. When he declared that the\r\nwoman tried to stab him, nobody believed him: the women said he would\r\nhave been served right if she had done so. How had these stories gone\r\nabroad? \xe2\x80\x9cThree days more, and I WILL fly,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Hayes; \xe2\x80\x9cand the world\r\nmay say what it pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAy, fool, fly--away so swiftly that Fate cannot overtake thee: hide so\r\ncunningly that Death shall not find thy place of refuge!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. BEING A PREPARATION FOR THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader, doubtless, doth now partly understand what dark acts of\r\nconspiracy are beginning to gather around Mr. Hayes; and possibly hath\r\ncomprehended--\r\n\r\n1. That if the rumour was universally credited which declared that Mrs.\r\nCatherine was only Hayes's mistress, and not his wife,\r\n\r\nShe might, if she so inclined, marry another person; and thereby\r\nnot injure her fame and excite wonderment, but actually add to her\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n2. That if all the world did steadfastly believe that Mr. Hayes intended\r\nto desert this woman, after having cruelly maltreated her,\r\n\r\nThe direction which his journey might take would be of no consequence;\r\nand he might go to Highgate, to Edinburgh, to Constantinople, nay, down\r\na well, and no soul would care to ask whither he had gone.\r\n\r\nThese points Mr. Hayes had not considered duly. The latter case had been\r\nput to him, and annoyed him, as we have seen; the former had actually\r\nbeen pressed upon him by Mrs. Hayes herself; who, in almost the only\r\ncommunication she had had with him since their last quarrel, had asked\r\nhim, angrily, in the presence of Wood and her son, whether he had dared\r\nto utter such lies, and how it came to pass that the neighbours looked\r\nscornfully at her, and avoided her?\r\n\r\nTo this charge Mr. Hayes pleaded, very meekly, that he was not guilty;\r\nand young Billings, taking him by the collar, and clinching his fist in\r\nhis face, swore a dreadful oath that he would have the life of him if\r\nhe dared abuse his mother. Mrs. Hayes then spoke of the general report\r\nabroad, that he was going to desert her; which, if he attempted to do,\r\nMr. Billings vowed that he would follow him to Jerusalem and have his\r\nblood. These threats, and the insolent language of young Billings,\r\nrather calmed Hayes than agitated him: he longed to be on his journey;\r\nbut he began to hope that no obstacle would be placed in the way of\r\nit. For the first time since many days, he began to enjoy a feeling\r\nsomething akin to security, and could look with tolerable confidence\r\ntowards a comfortable completion of his own schemes of treason.\r\n\r\nThese points being duly settled, we are now arrived, O public, at a\r\npoint for which the author's soul hath been yearning ever since this\r\nhistory commenced. We are now come, O critic, to a stage of the work\r\nwhen this tale begins to assume an appearance so interestingly horrific,\r\nthat you must have a heart of stone if you are not interested by it.\r\nO candid and discerning reader, who art sick of the hideous scenes of\r\nbrutal bloodshed which have of late come forth from pens of certain\r\neminent wits,[*] if you turn away disgusted from the book, remember that\r\nthis passage hath not been written for you, or such as you, who have\r\ntaste to know and hate the style in which it hath been composed; but\r\nfor the public, which hath no such taste:--for the public, which can\r\npatronise four different representations of Jack Sheppard,--for the\r\npublic whom its literary providers have gorged with blood and foul\r\nNewgate garbage,--and to whom we poor creatures, humbly following at\r\nthe tail of our great high-priests and prophets of the press, may, as in\r\nduty bound, offer some small gift of our own: a little mite truly,\r\nbut given with good-will. Come up, then, fair Catherine and brave\r\nCount;--appear, gallant Brock, and faultless Billings;--hasten hither,\r\nhonest John Hayes: the former chapters are but flowers in which we have\r\nbeen decking you for the sacrifice. Ascend to the altar, ye innocent\r\nlambs, and prepare for the final act: lo! the knife is sharpened, and\r\nthe sacrificer ready! Stretch your throats, sweet ones,--for the public\r\nis thirsty, and must have blood!\r\n\r\n     * This was written in 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE LAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Hayes had some notion of the attachment of Monsieur de\r\nGalgenstein for his wife is very certain: the man could not but perceive\r\nthat she was more gaily dressed, and more frequently absent than usual;\r\nand must have been quite aware that from the day of the quarrel until\r\nthe present period, Catherine had never asked him for a shilling for the\r\nhouse expenses. He had not the heart to offer, however; nor, in truth,\r\ndid she seem to remember that money was due.\r\n\r\nShe received, in fact, many sums from the tender Count. Tom was likewise\r\nliberally provided by the same personage; who was, moreover, continually\r\nsending presents of various kinds to the person on whom his affections\r\nwere centred.\r\n\r\nOne of these gifts was a hamper of choice mountain-wine, which had been\r\nsome weeks in the house, and excited the longing of Mr. Hayes, who loved\r\nwine very much. This liquor was generally drunk by Wood and Billings,\r\nwho applauded it greatly; and many times, in passing through the\r\nback-parlour,--which he had to traverse in order to reach the stair,\r\nHayes had cast a tender eye towards the drink; of which, had he dared,\r\nhe would have partaken.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March, in the year 1726, Mr. Hayes had gathered together\r\nalmost the whole sum with which he intended to decamp; and having on\r\nthat very day recovered the amount of a bill which he thought almost\r\nhopeless, he returned home in tolerable good-humour; and feeling, so\r\nnear was his period of departure, something like security. Nobody had\r\nattempted the least violence on him: besides, he was armed with pistols,\r\nhad his money in bills in a belt about his person, and really reasoned\r\nwith himself that there was no danger for him to apprehend.\r\n\r\nHe entered the house about dusk, at five o'clock. Mrs. Hayes was absent\r\nwith Mr. Billings; only Mr. Wood was smoking, according to his wont,\r\nin the little back-parlour; and as Mr. Hayes passed, the old gentleman\r\naddressed him in a friendly voice, and, wondering that he had been such\r\na stranger, invited him to sit and take a glass of wine. There was a\r\nlight and a foreman in the shop; Mr. Hayes gave his injunctions to that\r\nperson, and saw no objection to Mr. Wood's invitation.\r\n\r\nThe conversation, at first a little stiff between the two gentlemen,\r\nbegan speedily to grow more easy and confidential: and so particularly\r\nbland and good-humoured was Mr., or Doctor Wood, that his companion\r\nwas quite caught, and softened by the charm of his manner; and the pair\r\nbecame as good friends as in the former days of their intercourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would come down sometimes of evenings,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Doctor Wood;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor, though no book-learned man, Mr. Hayes, look you, you are a man\r\nof the world, and I can't abide the society of boys. There's Tom, now,\r\nsince this tiff with Mrs. Cat, the scoundrel plays the Grank Turk here!\r\nThe pair of 'em, betwixt them, have completely gotten the upper hand of\r\nyou. Confess that you are beaten, Master Hayes, and don't like the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hayes; \xe2\x80\x9cand that's the truth on't. A man doth not\r\nlike to have his wife's sins flung in his face, nor to be perpetually\r\nbullied in his own house by such a fiery sprig as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMischief, sir,--mischief only,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wood: \xe2\x80\x9c'tis the fun of youth, sir,\r\nand will go off as age comes to the lad. Bad as you may think him--and\r\nhe is as skittish and fierce, sure enough, as a young colt---there is\r\ngood stuff in him; and though he hath, or fancies he hath, the right to\r\nabuse every one, by the Lord he will let none others do so! Last week,\r\nnow, didn't he tell Mrs. Cat that you served her right in the last\r\nbeating matter? and weren't they coming to knives, just as in your case?\r\nBy my faith, they were. Ay, and at the \xe2\x80\x9cBraund's Head,\xe2\x80\x9d when some fellow\r\nsaid that you were a bloody Bluebeard, and would murder your wife,\r\nstab me if Tom wasn't up in an instant and knocked the fellow down for\r\nabusing of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first of these stories was quite true; the second was only a\r\ncharitable invention of Mr. Wood, and employed, doubtless, for the\r\namiable purpose of bringing the old and young men together. The scheme\r\npartially succeeded; for, though Hayes was not so far mollified towards\r\nTom as to entertain any affection for a young man whom he had cordially\r\ndetested ever since he knew him, yet he felt more at ease and cheerful\r\nregarding himself: and surely not without reason. While indulging in\r\nthese benevolent sentiments, Mrs. Catherine and her son arrived,\r\nand found, somewhat to their astonishment, Mr. Hayes seated in the\r\nback-parlour, as in former times; and they were invited by Mr. Wood to\r\nsit down and drink.\r\n\r\nWe have said that certain bottles of mountain-wine were presented by the\r\nCount to Mrs. Catherine: these were, at Mr. Wood's suggestion, produced;\r\nand Hayes, who had long been coveting them, was charmed to have an\r\nopportunity to drink his fill. He forthwith began bragging of his\r\ngreat powers as a drinker, and vowed that he could manage eight bottles\r\nwithout becoming intoxicated.\r\n\r\nMr. Wood grinned strangely, and looked in a peculiar way at Tom\r\nBillings, who grinned too. Mrs. Cat's eyes were turned towards the\r\nground: but her face was deadly pale.\r\n\r\nThe party began drinking. Hayes kept up his reputation as a toper, and\r\nswallowed one, two, three bottles without wincing. He grew talkative and\r\nmerry, and began to sing songs and to cut jokes; at which Wood laughed\r\nhugely, and Billings after him. Mrs. Cat could not laugh; but sat\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nWhat ailed her? Was she thinking of the Count? She had been with Max\r\nthat day, and had promised him, for the next night at ten, an interview\r\nnear his lodgings at Whitehall. It was the first time that she would\r\nsee him alone. They were to meet (not a very cheerful place for a\r\nlove-tryst) at St. Margaret's churchyard, near Westminster Abbey. Of\r\nthis, no doubt, Cat was thinking; but what could she mean by whispering\r\nto Wood, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! for God's sake, not tonight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe means we are to have no more liquor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wood to Mr. Hayes; who\r\nheard this sentence, and seemed rather alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's it,--no more liquor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Catherine eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have had\r\nenough to-night. Go to bed, and lock your door, and sleep, Mr. Hayes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I say I've NOT had enough drink!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Hayes; \xe2\x80\x9cI'm good for\r\nfive bottles more, and wager I will drink them too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone, for a guinea!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone, and done!\xe2\x80\x9d said Billings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe YOU quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Hayes, scowling at the lad. \xe2\x80\x9cI will drink what\r\nI please, and ask no counsel of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d And he muttered some more curses\r\nagainst young Billings, which showed what his feelings were towards his\r\nwife's son; and which the latter, for a wonder, only received with a\r\nscornful smile, and a knowing look at Wood.\r\n\r\nWell! the five extra bottles were brought, and drunk by Mr. Hayes;\r\nand seasoned by many songs from the recueil of Mr. Thomas d'Urfey and\r\nothers. The chief part of the talk and merriment was on Hayes's part;\r\nas, indeed, was natural,--for, while he drank bottle after bottle of\r\nwine, the other two gentlemen confined themselves to small beer,--both\r\npleading illness as an excuse for their sobriety.\r\n\r\nAnd now might we depict, with much accuracy, the course of Mr. Hayes's\r\nintoxication, as it rose from the merriment of the three-bottle point\r\nto the madness of the four--from the uproarious quarrelsomeness of the\r\nsixth bottle to the sickly stupidity of the seventh; but we are\r\ndesirous of bringing this tale to a conclusion, and must pretermit\r\nall consideration of a subject so curious, so instructive, and so\r\ndelightful. Suffice it to say, as a matter of history, that Mr. Hayes\r\ndid actually drink seven bottles of mountain-wine; and that Mr. Thomas\r\nBillings went to the \xe2\x80\x9cBraund's Head,\xe2\x80\x9d in Bond Street, and purchased\r\nanother, which Hayes likewise drank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat'll do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wood to young Billings; and they led Hayes up to\r\nbed, whither, in truth, he was unable to walk himself.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nMrs. Springatt, the lodger, came down to ask what the noise was. \xe2\x80\x9c'Tis\r\nonly Tom Billings making merry with some friends from the country,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Mrs. Hayes; whereupon Springatt retired, and the house was\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nSome scuffling and stamping was heard about eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nAfter they had seen Mr. Hayes to bed, Billings remembered that he had a\r\nparcel to carry to some person in the neighbourhood of the Strand;\r\nand, as the night was remarkably fine, he and Mr. Wood agreed to walk\r\ntogether, and set forth accordingly.\r\n\r\n(Here follows a description of the THAMES AT MIDNIGHT, in a fine\r\nhistorical style; with an account of Lambeth, Westminster, the Savoy,\r\nBaynard's Castle, Arundel House, the Temple; of Old London Bridge,\r\nwith its twenty arches, \xe2\x80\x9con which be houses builded, so that it seemeth\r\nrather a continuall street than a bridge;\xe2\x80\x9d--of Bankside, and the \xe2\x80\x9cGlobe\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and the \xe2\x80\x9cFortune\xe2\x80\x9d Theatres; of the ferries across the river, and of the\r\npirates who infest the same--namely, tinklermen, petermen, hebbermen,\r\ntrawlermen; of the fleet of barges that lay at the Savoy steps; and of\r\nthe long lines of slim wherries sleeping on the river banks and basking\r\nand shining in the moonbeams. A combat on the river is described,\r\nthat takes place between the crews of a tinklerman's boat and the\r\nwater-bailiffs. Shouting his war-cry, \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Mary Overy a la rescousse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the water-bailiff sprung at the throat of the tinklerman captain. The\r\ncrews of both vessels, as if aware that the struggle of their chiefs\r\nwould decide the contest, ceased hostilities, and awaited on their\r\nrespective poops the issue of the death-shock. It was not long\r\ncoming. \xe2\x80\x9cYield, dog!\xe2\x80\x9d said the water-bailiff. The tinklerman could not\r\nanswer--for his throat was grasped too tight in the iron clench of the\r\ncity champion; but drawing his snickersnee, he plunged it seven times in\r\nthe bailiff's chest: still the latter fell not. The death-rattle gurgled\r\nin the throat of his opponent; his arms fell heavily to his side.\r\nFoot to foot, each standing at the side of his boat, stood the brave\r\nmen--THEY WERE BOTH DEAD! \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of St. Clement Danes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmaster, \xe2\x80\x9cgive way, my men!\xe2\x80\x9d and, thrusting forward his halberd (seven\r\nfeet long, richly decorated with velvet and brass nails, and having\r\nthe city arms, argent, a cross gules, and in the first quarter a dagger\r\ndisplayed of the second), he thrust the tinklerman's boat away from his\r\nown; and at once the bodies of the captains plunged down, down, down,\r\ndown in the unfathomable waters.\r\n\r\nAfter this follows another episode. Two masked ladies quarrel at the\r\ndoor of a tavern overlooking the Thames: they turn out to be Stella and\r\nVanessa, who have followed Swift thither; who is in the act of reading\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGulliver's Travels\xe2\x80\x9d to Gay, Arbuthnot, Bolingbroke, and Pope. Two\r\nfellows are sitting shuddering under a doorway; to one of them Tom\r\nBillings flung a sixpence. He little knew that the names of those two\r\nyoung men were--Samuel Johnson and Richard Savage.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER LAST CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hayes did not join the family the next day; and it appears that\r\nthe previous night's reconciliation was not very durable; for when Mrs.\r\nSpringatt asked Wood for Hayes, Mr. Wood stated that Hayes had gone away\r\nwithout saying whither he was bound, or how long he might be absent.\r\nHe only said, in rather a sulky tone, that he should probably pass the\r\nnight at a friend's house. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I know of no friend he hath,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n added Mr. Wood; \xe2\x80\x9cand pray Heaven that he may not think of deserting his\r\npoor wife, whom he hath beaten and ill-used so already!\xe2\x80\x9d In this prayer\r\nMrs. Springatt joined; and so these two worthy people parted.\r\n\r\nWhat business Billings was about cannot be said; but he was this night\r\nbound towards Marylebone Fields, as he was the night before for the\r\nStrand and Westminster; and, although the night was very stormy and\r\nrainy, as the previous evening had been fine, old Wood good-naturedly\r\nresolved upon accompanying him; and forth they sallied together.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catherine, too, had HER business, as we have seen; but this was of\r\na very delicate nature. At nine o'clock, she had an appointment with\r\nthe Count; and faithfully, by that hour, had found her way to Saint\r\nMargaret's churchyard, near Westminster Abbey, where she awaited\r\nMonsieur de Galgenstein.\r\n\r\nThe spot was convenient, being very lonely, and at the same time close\r\nto the Count's lodgings at Whitehall. His Excellency came, but somewhat\r\nafter the hour; for, to say the truth, being a freethinker, he had\r\nthe most firm belief in ghosts and demons, and did not care to pace\r\na churchyard alone. He was comforted, therefore, when he saw a woman\r\nmuffled in a cloak, who held out her hand to him at the gate, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you?\xe2\x80\x9d He took her hand,--it was very clammy and cold; and at\r\nher desire he bade his confidential footman, who had attended him with a\r\ntorch, to retire, and leave him to himself.\r\n\r\nThe torch-bearer retired, and left them quite in darkness; and the pair\r\nentered the little cemetery, cautiously threading their way among the\r\ntombs. They sat down on one, underneath a tree it seemed to be; the wind\r\nwas very cold, and its piteous howling was the only noise that broke\r\nthe silence of the place. Catherine's teeth were chattering, for all her\r\nwraps; and when Max drew her close to him, and encircled her waist with\r\none arm, and pressed her hand, she did not repulse him, but rather\r\ncame close to him, and with her own damp fingers feebly returned his\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe poor thing was very wretched and weeping. She confided to Max the\r\ncause of her grief. She was alone in the world,--alone and penniless.\r\nHer husband had left her; she had that very day received a letter from\r\nhim which confirmed all that she had suspected so long. He had left her,\r\ncarried away all his property, and would not return!\r\n\r\nIf we say that a selfish joy filled the breast of Monsieur de\r\nGalgenstein, the reader will not be astonished. A heartless libertine,\r\nhe felt glad at the prospect of Catherine's ruin; for he hoped that\r\nnecessity would make her his own. He clasped the poor thing to his\r\nheart, and vowed that he would replace the husband she had lost, and\r\nthat his fortune should be hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you replace him?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, truly, in everything but the name, dear Catherine; and when he\r\ndies, I swear you shall be Countess of Galgenstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you swear?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy everything that is most sacred: were you free now, I would\xe2\x80\x9d (and\r\nhere he swore a terrific oath) \xe2\x80\x9cat once make you mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe have seen before that it cost Monsieur de Galgenstein nothing to\r\nmake these vows. Hayes was likely, too, to live as long as Catherine--as\r\nlong, at least, as the Count's connection with her; but he was caught in\r\nhis own snare.\r\n\r\nShe took his hand and kissed it repeatedly, and bathed it in her tears,\r\nand pressed it to her bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cMax,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI AM FREE! Be mine, and I\r\nwill love you as I have done for years and years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMax started back. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, is he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not dead: but he never was my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe let go her hand, and, interrupting her, said sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, madam,\r\nif this carpenter never was your husband, I see no cause why _I_\r\nshould be. If a lady, who hath been for twenty years the mistress of a\r\nmiserable country boor, cannot find it in her heart to put up with the\r\nprotection of a nobleman--a sovereign's representative--she may seek a\r\nhusband elsewhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was no man's mistress except yours,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Catherine, wringing her\r\nhands and sobbing wildly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, O Heaven! I deserved this. Because I was\r\na child, and you saw, and ruined, and left me--because, in my sorrow and\r\nrepentance, I wished to repair my crime, and was touched by that man's\r\nlove, and married him--because he too deceives and leaves me--because,\r\nafter loving you--madly loving you for twenty years--I will not now\r\nforfeit your respect, and degrade myself by yielding to your will, you\r\ntoo must scorn me! It is too much--too much--O Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d And the wretched\r\nwoman fell back almost fainting.\r\n\r\nMax was almost frightened by this burst of sorrow on her part, and was\r\ncoming forward to support her; but she motioned him away, and, taking\r\nfrom her bosom a letter, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were light, you could see, Max,\r\nhow cruelly I have been betrayed by that man who called himself my\r\nhusband. Long before he married me, he was married to another. This\r\nwoman is still living, he says; and he says he leaves me for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the moon, which had been hidden behind Westminster Abbey,\r\nrose above the vast black mass of that edifice, and poured a flood of\r\nsilver light upon the little church of St. Margaret's, and the spot\r\nwhere the lovers stood. Max was at a little distance from Catherine,\r\npacing gloomily up and down the flags. She remained at her old position\r\nat the tombstone under the tree, or pillar, as it seemed to be, as the\r\nmoon got up. She was leaning against the pillar, and holding out to Max,\r\nwith an arm beautifully white and rounded, the letter she had received\r\nfrom her husband: \xe2\x80\x9cRead it, Max,\xe2\x80\x9d she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI asked for light, and here\r\nis Heaven's own, by which you may read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Max did not come forward to receive it. On a sudden his face assumed\r\na look of the most dreadful surprise and agony. He stood still, and\r\nstared with wild eyes starting from their sockets; he stared upwards,\r\nat a point seemingly above Catherine's head. At last he raised up his\r\nfinger slowly and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook, Cat--THE HEAD--THE HEAD!\xe2\x80\x9d Then uttering a\r\nhorrible laugh, he fell down grovelling among the stones, gibbering and\r\nwrithing in a fit of epilepsy.\r\n\r\nCatherine started forward and looked up. She had been standing against a\r\npost, not a tree--the moon was shining full on it now; and on the summit\r\nstrangely distinct, and smiling ghastly, was a livid human head.\r\n\r\nThe wretched woman fled--she dared look no more. And some hours\r\nafterwards, when, alarmed by the Count's continued absence, his\r\nconfidential servant came back to seek for him in the churchyard, he was\r\nfound sitting on the flags, staring full at the head, and laughing,\r\nand talking to it wildly, and nodding at it. He was taken up a hopeless\r\nidiot, and so lived for years and years; clanking the chain, and moaning\r\nunder the lash, and howling through long nights when the moon peered\r\nthrough the bars of his solitary cell, and he buried his face in the\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\nThere--the murder is out! And having indulged himself in a chapter of\r\nthe very finest writing, the author begs the attention of the British\r\npublic towards it; humbly conceiving that it possesses some of those\r\npeculiar merits which have rendered the fine writing in other chapters\r\nof the works of other authors so famous.\r\n\r\nWithout bragging at all, let us just point out the chief claims of the\r\nabove pleasing piece of composition. In the first place, it is perfectly\r\nstilted and unnatural; the dialogue and the sentiments being artfully\r\narranged, so as to be as strong and majestic as possible. Our dear Cat\r\nis but a poor illiterate country wench, who has come from cutting her\r\nhusband's throat; and yet, see! she talks and looks like a tragedy\r\nprincess, who is suffering in the most virtuous blank verse. This is the\r\nproper end of fiction, and one of the greatest triumphs that a novelist\r\ncan achieve: for to make people sympathise with virtue is a vulgar trick\r\nthat any common fellow can do; but it is not everybody who can take a\r\nscoundrel, and cause us to weep and whimper over him as though he were\r\na very saint. Give a young lady of five years old a skein of silk and\r\na brace of netting-needles, and she will in a short time turn you out\r\na decent silk purse--anybody can; but try her with a sow's ear, and see\r\nwhether she can make a silk purse out of THAT. That is the work for your\r\nreal great artist; and pleasant it is to see how many have succeeded in\r\nthese latter days.\r\n\r\nThe subject is strictly historical, as anyone may see by referring to\r\nthe Daily Post of March 3, 1726, which contains the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday morning, early, a man's head, that by the freshness of it\r\nseemed to have been newly cut off from the body, having its own hair\r\non, was found by the river's side, near Millbank, Westminster, and was\r\nafterwards exposed to public view in St. Margaret's churchyard, where\r\nthousands of people have seen it; but none could tell who the unhappy\r\nperson was, much less who committed such a horrid and barbarous action.\r\nThere are various conjectures relating to the deceased; but there being\r\nnothing certain, we omit them. The head was much hacked and mangled in\r\nthe cutting off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head which caused such an impression upon Monsieur de Galgenstein\r\nwas, indeed, once on the shoulders of Mr. John Hayes, who lost it under\r\nthe following circumstances. We have seen how Mr. Hayes was induced\r\nto drink. Mr. Hayes having been encouraged in drinking the wine, and\r\ngrowing very merry therewith, he sang and danced about the room; but his\r\nwife, fearing the quantity he had drunk would not have the wished-for\r\neffect on him, she sent away for another bottle, of which he drank\r\nalso. This effectually answered their expectations; and Mr. Hayes became\r\nthereby intoxicated, and deprived of his understanding.\r\n\r\nHe, however, made shift to get into the other room, and, throwing\r\nhimself upon the bed, fell asleep; upon which Mrs. Hayes reminded them\r\nof the affair in hand, and told them that was the most proper juncture\r\nto finish the business. [*]\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n     * The description of the murder and the execution of the\r\n     culprits, which here follows in the original, was taken from\r\n     the newspapers of the day.  Coming from such a source they\r\n     have, as may be imagined, no literary merit whatever.  The\r\n     details of the crime are simply horrible, without one touch\r\n     of even that sort of romance which sometimes gives a little\r\n     dignity to murder.  As such they precisely suited Mr.\r\n     Thackeray's purpose at the time--which was to show the real\r\n     manners and customs of the Sheppards and Turpins who were\r\n     then the popular heroes of fiction.  But nowadays there is\r\n     no such purpose to serve, and therefore these too literal\r\n     details are omitted.\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n\r\nRing, ding, ding! the gloomy green curtain drops, the dramatis personae\r\nare duly disposed of, the nimble candle snuffers put out the lights, and\r\nthe audience goeth pondering home. If the critic take the pains to ask\r\nwhy the author, who hath been so diffuse in describing the early and\r\nfabulous acts of Mrs. Catherine's existence, should so hurry off the\r\ncatastrophe where a deal of the very finest writing might have been\r\nemployed, Solomons replies that the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d narrative is far\r\nmore emphatic than any composition of his own could be, with all the\r\nrhetorical graces which he might employ. Mr. Aram's trial, as taken by\r\nthe penny-a-liners of those days, had always interested him more than\r\nthe lengthened and poetical report which an eminent novelist has given\r\nof the same. Mr. Turpin's adventures are more instructive and agreeable\r\nto him in the account of the Newgate Plutarch, than in the learned\r\nAinsworth's Biographical Dictionary. And as he believes that the\r\nprofessional gentlemen who are employed to invest such heroes with the\r\nrewards that their great actions merit, will go through the ceremony of\r\nthe grand cordon with much more accuracy and despatch than can be shown\r\nby the most distinguished amateur; in like manner he thinks that the\r\nhistory of such investitures should be written by people directly\r\nconcerned, and not by admiring persons without, who must be ignorant of\r\nmany of the secrets of Ketchcraft. We very much doubt if Milton himself\r\ncould make a description of an execution half so horrible as the simple\r\nlines in the Daily Post of a hundred and ten years since, that now lies\r\nbefore us--\xe2\x80\x9cherrlich wie am ersten Tag,\xe2\x80\x9d--as bright and clean as on\r\nthe day of publication. Think of it! it has been read by Belinda at her\r\ntoilet, scanned at \xe2\x80\x9cButton's\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWill's,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered at by wits, talked\r\nof in palaces and cottages, by a busy race in wigs, red heels, hoops,\r\npatches, and rags of all variety--a busy race that hath long since\r\nplunged and vanished in the unfathomable gulf towards which we march so\r\nbriskly.\r\n\r\nWhere are they? \xe2\x80\x9cAfflavit Deus\xe2\x80\x9d--and they are gone! Hark! is not the\r\nsame wind roaring still that shall sweep us down? and yonder stands the\r\ncompositor at his types who shall put up a pretty paragraph some day to\r\nsay how, \xe2\x80\x9cYesterday, at his house in Grosvenor Square,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cAt Botany\r\nBay, universally regretted,\xe2\x80\x9d died So-and-So. Into what profound\r\nmoralities is the paragraph concerning Mrs. Catherine's burning leading\r\nus!\r\n\r\nAy, truly, and to that very point have we wished to come; for, having\r\nfinished our delectable meal, it behoves us to say a word or two by way\r\nof grace at its conclusion, and be heartily thankful that it is over. It\r\nhas been the writer's object carefully to exclude from his drama (except\r\nin two very insignificant instances--mere walking-gentlemen parts), any\r\ncharacters but those of scoundrels of the very highest degree. That he\r\nhas not altogether failed in the object he had in view, is evident from\r\nsome newspaper critiques which he has had the good fortune to see; and\r\nwhich abuse the tale of \xe2\x80\x9cCatherine\xe2\x80\x9d as one of the dullest, most vulgar,\r\nand immoral works extant. It is highly gratifying to the author to find\r\nthat such opinions are abroad, as they convince him that the taste for\r\nNewgate literature is on the wane, and that when the public critic has\r\nright down undisguised immorality set before him, the honest creature is\r\nshocked at it, as he should be, and can declare his indignation in good\r\nround terms of abuse. The characters of the tale ARE immoral, and no\r\ndoubt of it; but the writer humbly hopes the end is not so. The public\r\nwas, in our notion, dosed and poisoned by the prevailing style of\r\nliterary practice, and it was necessary to administer some medicine\r\nthat would produce a wholesome nausea, and afterwards bring about a more\r\nhealthy habit.\r\n\r\nAnd, thank Heaven, this effect HAS been produced in very many instances,\r\nand that the \xe2\x80\x9cCatherine\xe2\x80\x9d cathartic has acted most efficaciously. The\r\nauthor has been pleased at the disgust which his work has excited, and\r\nhas watched with benevolent carefulness the wry faces that have been\r\nmade by many of the patients who have swallowed the dose. Solomons\r\nremembers, at the establishment in Birchin Lane where he had the honour\r\nof receiving his education, there used to be administered to the boys a\r\ncertain cough-medicine, which was so excessively agreeable that all the\r\nlads longed to have colds in order to partake of the remedy. Some of our\r\npopular novelists have compounded their drugs in a similar way, and\r\nmade them so palatable that a public, once healthy and honest, has been\r\nwell-nigh poisoned by their wares. Solomons defies anyone to say the\r\nlike of himself--that his doses have been as pleasant as champagne, and\r\nhis pills as sweet as barley-sugar;--it has been his attempt to make\r\nvice to appear entirely vicious; and in those instances where he hath\r\noccasionally introduced something like virtue, to make the sham as\r\nevident as possible, and not allow the meanest capacity a single chance\r\nto mistake it.\r\n\r\nAnd what has been the consequence? That wholesome nausea which it has\r\nbeen his good fortune to create wherever he has been allowed to practise\r\nin his humble circle.\r\n\r\nHas anyone thrown away a halfpennyworth of sympathy upon any person\r\nmentioned in this history? Surely no. But abler and more famous men than\r\nSolomons have taken a different plan; and it becomes every man in his\r\nvocation to cry out against such, and expose their errors as best he\r\nmay.\r\n\r\nLabouring under such ideas, Mr. Isaac Solomons, junior, produced the\r\nromance of Mrs. Cat, and confesses himself completely happy to have\r\nbrought it to a conclusion. His poem may be dull--ay, and probably\r\nis. The great Blackmore, the great Dennis, the great Sprat, the great\r\nPomfret, not to mention great men of our own time--have they not also\r\nbeen dull, and had pretty reputations too? Be it granted Solomons IS\r\ndull; but don't attack his morality; he humbly submits that, in his\r\npoem, no man shall mistake virtue for vice, no man shall allow a single\r\nsentiment of pity or admiration to enter his bosom for any character of\r\nthe piece: it being, from beginning to end, a scene of unmixed rascality\r\nperformed by persons who never deviate into good feeling. And although\r\nhe doth not pretend to equal the great modern authors, whom he hath\r\nmentioned, in wit or descriptive power; yet, in the point of moral, he\r\nmeekly believes that he has been their superior; feeling the greatest\r\ndisgust for the characters he describes, and using his humble endeavour\r\nto cause the public also to hate them.\r\n\r\nHorsemonger Lane: January 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Catherine: A Story, by William Makepeace Thackeray\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CATHERINE: A STORY ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1969-0.txt or 1969-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/6/1969/\r\n\r\nProduced by Les Bowler\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
