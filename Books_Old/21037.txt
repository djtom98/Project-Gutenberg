On the other hand I was also at a\r\nboarding school for boys aged 8 to 13, which was much more like the\r\nschool in this story.  As I say, things must have changed.\r\n\r\nIt takes about ten hours to play as an audiobook.  There are a number of\r\nquite tense incidents, particularly when a party of boys decide to walk\r\nup a nearby mountain, and the weather turns very nasty.  This is in\r\nchapters 17 to 19.  But there are many other well-described incidents,\r\nso do read the book, remembering that boys\' slang has changed greatly in\r\nthe past hundred years.\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nTHE COCK-HOUSE AT FELLSGARTH\r\n\r\nBY TALBOT BAINES REED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nGREEN AND BLUE.\r\n\r\nFirst-night at Fellsgarth was always a festive occasion.  The holidays\r\nwere over, and school had not yet begun.  All day long, from remote\r\nquarters, fellows had been converging on the dear old place; and here\r\nthey were at last, shoulder to shoulder, delighted to find themselves\r\nback in the old haunts.  The glorious memories of the summer holidays\r\nwere common property.  So was not a little of the pocket-money.  So, by\r\nrule immemorial, were the contents of the hampers.  And so, as they\r\ndiscovered to their cost, were the luckless new boys who had to-day\r\ntumbled for the first time headlong into the whirlpool of public school\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nDoes some one tell me he never heard of Fellsgarth?  I am surprised.\r\nWhere can you have been brought up that you have never heard of the\r\nvenerable ivy-clad pile with its watch-tower and two wings, planted\r\nthere, where the rivers Shale and Shargle mingle their waters, a mile or\r\nmore above Hawkswater?  My dear sir, Fellsgarth stood there before the\r\ndays when Henry the Eighth, (of whom you may have possibly heard in the\r\nhistory books) abolished the monasteries and, some wicked people do say,\r\nannexed their contents.\r\n\r\nThere is very little of the old place standing now.  A piece of the wall\r\nin the head-master\'s garden and the lower buttresses of the watch-tower,\r\nthat is all.  The present building is comparatively modern; that is to\r\nsay, it is no older than the end of the Civil Wars, when some lucky\r\nadherent to the winning side built it up as a manor-house and disfigured\r\nthe tower with those four pepper-castors at the corners.  Successive\r\nowners have tinkered the place since then, but they cannot quite spoil\r\nit.  Who can spoil red brick and ivy, in such a situation?\r\n\r\nNot know Fellsgarth!  Have you never been on Hawkswater then, with its\r\nlonely island, and the grey screes swooping down into the clear water?\r\nAnd have you never seen Hawk\'s Pike, which frowns in on the fellows\r\nthrough the dormitory window?  I don\'t ask if you have been up it.  Only\r\nthree persons, to my knowledge (guides and natives of course excepted),\r\nhave done that.  Yorke was one, Mr Stratton was another, and the\r\nother--but that\'s to be part of my story.\r\n\r\nFirst-night, as I have said, was a specially "go-as-you-please" occasion\r\nat the school.  Masters, having called over their roll, disappeared into\r\ntheir own quarters and discreetly heard nothing.  Dames, having received\r\nand unpacked the "night-bags," retired elsewhere to wrestle with the big\r\nluggage.  The cooks, having passably satisfied the cravings of two\r\nhundred and fifty hungry souls, and having removed out of harm\'s way the\r\nmost perishable of the crockery, shrugged their shoulders and shut\r\nthemselves into the kitchens, listening to the noise and speculating on\r\nthe joys of the coming term.\r\n\r\nWhat a noise it was!  Niagara after the rains, or an express train in a\r\ntunnel, or the north wind in a gale against the Hawk\'s Back might be\r\nable to beat it.  But then Fellsgarth was not competing; each of the\r\nfellows was merely chatting pleasantly to his neighbours.  It was hardly\r\na fair trial.  And yet it was not bad for the School.  When Dangle, who\r\nowned the longest ear in the school, could not hear a word which\r\nBrinkman, who owned the loudest voice, shouted into it, it spoke\r\nsomewhat for what Fellsgarth might do in the way of noise if it tried.\r\n\r\nThe only two persons who were not actively contributing to the general\r\nclamour were the two new boys who sat wedged in among a mass of juniors\r\nat one of the lower tables.  They may have considered that the beating\r\nof their hearts was noisy enough.  But people in this world are slow at\r\nhearing other people\'s hearts beat.  No one seemed to notice it.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the stouter of these two young gentlemen to say that the\r\nbeating of his heart, and the general state of amaze in which he found\r\nhimself, did not interfere greatly with his appetite.  He had brought\r\nthat accomplishment, if no other, from home, and not being engaged like\r\nthose around him in conversation, he contrived to put away really a most\r\nrespectable meal.  Indeed, his exploits in this direction had already\r\nbecome a matter for remark among his neighbours.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right," said one of the juniors, who answered to the name of\r\nD\'Arcy; "his buttons are sewn on with wire.  They\'ll hold."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'s made of gutta-percha," observed another.  "He\'ll stretch\r\na little more before he\'s done."\r\n\r\n"I say, what a bill he\'s running up!  By the way, what do they charge\r\nfor this kind of pudding?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a dear kind--and nothing like as good as the sort we get for\r\nregular.  I never could understand why they make fellows shell out for\r\nwhat they eat first-night."\r\n\r\n"It _is_ a swindle," said D\'Arcy, solemnly.  "I\'ve had to make a very\r\nlight meal, because I\'ve only half a crown, and I\'m afraid there won\'t\r\nbe much change left out of that."\r\n\r\nThe new boy was just laying butter on a roll, and preparing to close the\r\nproceedings of the meal with a good square turn of bread and butter.\r\nBut as D\'Arcy\'s words fell on his ears he suddenly stopped short and\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\n"I say," said he, "isn\'t this dinner charged in the house bill then?"\r\n\r\nD\'Arcy laughed derisively.\r\n\r\n"Well, you most be a muff.  Don\'t you know school doesn\'t begin till to-\r\nmorrow?  They give you dinner to-night, but you\'re not obliged to eat\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThe new boy took a gulp of water, which he calculated would be gratis\r\nunder any circumstances, and then gasped--"I say, I didn\'t know that."\r\n\r\nD\'Arcy looked solemn.  "Jolly awkward," said he; "what have you had?"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Master Ashby, the new boy, entered on a detailed confession,\r\nwhich D\'Arcy, evidently an expert at mental arithmetic, "totted up" as\r\nhe went along.\r\n\r\n"How many times pudding did you say?" he asked towards the end, "Twice\r\nand a bit."\r\n\r\n"Three and ten; I dare say he won\'t be stiff about the bit, three and\r\nten; and that roll and butter--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not eaten them."\r\n\r\n"No, but you\'ve touched them.  You\'ll be charged, unless you can get a\r\nfellow to take them off your hands."\r\n\r\n"Will _you_ have them?" asked Ashby.\r\n\r\nWhereupon there was a laugh at _D\'Arcy\'s_ expense, which annoyed that\r\nyoung gentleman.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want your second-hand grub.  You\'d better take it round and see\r\nwhat you can get for it."\r\n\r\nAshby looked at the bread, and then glanced round the table.\r\n\r\n"No," said he, "I\'ll have it and pay for it, if it comes to that."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be four bob."\r\n\r\nAshby gave a gulp of despair.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not got so much."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll get in a jolly row."\r\n\r\n"Could you lend me one and six, I say?" asked the new boy.\r\n\r\nAgain D\'Arcy got the worst of the laugh.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you hear me say I\'d only just got enough to pay for my own?  But\r\nI tell you what; you can hide under the table.  You\'re not known."\r\n\r\nAshby looked round, and felt about with his foot under the table to\r\nascertain what room there might be there.  Then he flushed up.  "No, I\r\nshan\'t," said he; "I\'d get into the row instead."\r\n\r\nAs his eye travelled round and marked the curious smile on every face it\r\nsuddenly dawned upon him that he had been "done."  His first sensation\r\nwas one of immense relief.  He should not have to pay for his dinner\r\nafter all!  His second was a cunning device for getting out of the\r\ndilemma.\r\n\r\n"I thought you\'d begin to laugh soon," said he to D\'Arcy.  "I knew you\r\ncouldn\'t keep it up."\r\n\r\nD\'Arcy turned very red in the face and glared at this audacious\r\nyoungster in deserved wrath.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, you young ass?  You know you\'ve swallowed it all."\r\n\r\n"He swallowed all the grub anyhow," said another.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve not," said Master Ashby.  "I\'d have another go-in now.  I knew\r\nhe\'d have to laugh in the end."\r\n\r\nIt was hopeless to deal seriously with a rebel of this sort.  D\'Arcy\r\ntried to ride off on the high horse; but it was not a very grand\r\nspectacle, and Ashby, munching up the remains of his roll, was generally\r\nheld to have scored.  The relief with which he hailed the discovery of\r\nhis mistake was so genuine, and the good spirits and appetite the\r\nincident put into him were so imperturbable, as to disarm further\r\nexperiment at his expense, and he was left comparatively free to enjoy\r\nthe noise and imbibe his first impression of Fellsgarth in his own way.\r\n\r\nThe other new boy, meanwhile, was not altogether without his\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nFisher minor, to which name this ingenuous young gentleman answered,\r\nwould probably have been the first to pour contempt on the verdure of\r\nhis companion.  He had come up to Fellsgarth determined that, in\r\nwhatever respect he failed, no one should lightly convict him of being\r\ngreen.  He had wormed out of his brother in the Sixth a few hints of\r\nwhat was considered the proper thing at Fellsgarth, and these, with the\r\naid of his own brilliant intellect and reminiscences of what he had read\r\nin the books, served, as he hoped, both to forewarn and forearm him\r\nagainst all the uncomfortable predicaments into which the ordinary new\r\nboy is apt to fall.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that as he sat and listened to the noise, and\r\nmarked how little Fellsgarth appeared to recognise his existence, he\r\nfelt a trifle uneasy and nervous.  He wasn\'t sure now that he knew\r\neverything.  All these fellows seemed to be so thoroughly at home, and\r\nto know so exactly what to do; he wished he could do the same.\r\n\r\nHe wished, for instance, he could spin a fork round with his first\r\nfinger and thumb while he talked, as Yorke, the captain, was doing.  He\r\ndid once privately try, while he was not talking, but it was a dismal\r\nfailure.  The fork fell with a great clatter to the floor and attracted\r\ngeneral attraction his way.  He picked the weapon up with as easy an air\r\nas he could assume, whistling _sotto voce_ to himself as he did it, so\r\nas to appear unconcerned.\r\n\r\n"Look out, I say; you mustn\'t whistle at meal-times, it\'s bad manners,"\r\nsaid a voice at his side.\r\n\r\nHe turned round and perceived a pleasant-looking youth of the species\r\njunior, in a red tie and wrist studs to match.\r\n\r\nThis youth evidently knew what was what at Fellsgarth; and a further\r\nglance at him convinced Fisher minor that he had met him in a good hour.\r\nFor all dinner-time he had been exercised as to whether it was the\r\nthing to wear the jacket opened or buttoned.  Yorke wore his buttoned,\r\nso did a good many of the Sixth; and Fisher minor had consequently\r\nbuttoned up too.  But his new friend, who was pronounced in all his ways\r\nand evidently an authority on etiquette, wore his open.  Fisher minor\r\ntherefore furtively slipped his fingers down and opened his coat.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a new kid, I suppose," said he of the red necktie.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m Fisher minor."\r\n\r\n"What, son of Fisher the boat-builder?  I didn\'t know he had one so\r\nold."\r\n\r\n"No, oh no.  That\'s my brother up there, talking to the Dux."\r\n\r\n"The who?  I don\'t see any ducks."\r\n\r\n"I mean Yorke, you know, the captain."\r\n\r\n"Why ever do you call him ducks?  You\'d better let him catch you calling\r\nhim names like that.  Oh, you\'re a brother of old Fisher?  You look it."\r\n\r\nFisher minor was alarmed at the tone in which this observation was made.\r\nIt seemed to imply that Fisher major was not quite all that could be\r\ndesired, and yet the younger brother did not exactly know what it was in\r\nthe elder which called for repudiation.  However, he was spared the pain\r\nof deciding by a new voice on his other side.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that, Wally?  Does this kid say he belongs to Fisher?  Oh, my\r\nstars, what form we\'re coming to!"\r\n\r\nFisher minor glanced round, and experienced a shock as he did so.\r\n\r\nFor the new speaker was so like the last that he was tempted to suppose\r\nthe latter had suddenly changed seats and contrived to substitute a blue\r\nnecktie for a red, and button his jacket during the feat.  But when he\r\nlooked back, the owner of the red tie was still in his place.  After\r\nconsiderable wagging of his head, he was forced to admit that he was\r\nseated between two different persons.\r\n\r\n"Why, he can\'t help that," said the gentleman addressed as Wally.\r\n\r\nFisher minor laughed feebly, and really wished his brother would pay a\r\nlittle more attention to the "form."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Wally, talking across to his twin brother, "fellows\r\ncan\'t tell what asses they look until they\'re told.  Don\'t you remember\r\nthe chap last term who always wore his trousers turned up, till the\r\nprefects made him turn them down or go on the Modern side."\r\n\r\n"Catch us taking any of your cast-off louts on our side," retorted the\r\nother brother, who evidently belonged to the slighted side; "yes--\r\nshocking bad form it was--and when he turned them down at last, they\r\nfound seventy-four nibs, fifty matches, and nobody knows how many\r\ncandle-ends."\r\n\r\nAll this time Fisher minor, with panic at his heart, was furiously\r\ntrying to turn down his trouser-ends with his feet.  What a lucky escape\r\nfor him to get this warning in time!  During the walk round the grounds\r\nhe had turned his ends up, and had quite forgotten to put them down\r\nagain when he came in.  Now, no coaxing would get them down without\r\nmanual assistance.  He sat clawing with one foot after another,\r\nlacerating his shins and his garments in vain.  At length in despair he\r\ndropped his fork again, and under cover of this diversion attempted to\r\nstoop and adjust the intractable folds.\r\n\r\nIn his flurry he naturally forgot the fork; so that when, after a minute\r\nand a half, he emerged without it into the upper world, his two\r\ncompanions were not a little perplexed.\r\n\r\n"What have you been up to down there?  Do you generally eat your grub\r\nunder the table?" asked Wally.  "All I can say is, it\'s the best place\r\nfor him if he wears his hair like that," said the other in tones of\r\nalarm.  "Young kid, I never noticed that before!  Whatever induces you\r\nto part it on the right?  Did you ever hear of a Fellsgarth fellow-- Oh,\r\nI say, what a wigging you\'ll get!  Look at me and Wally and Yorke and\r\nall of \'em.  Whew! it makes one ill to see it!  Just look round for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nAs more than half of those present appeared to have no parting at all,\r\nand most of the rest parted on the left, Fisher minor realised with\r\nhorror that he had been guilty of a terrible solecism.\r\n\r\nThe alarm depicted in the faces of both the twins was proof enough that\r\nthe matter was a critical one.  It was no time for shuffling.  He had\r\nhad enough of that over his trouser-ends.  He must throw himself on the\r\nmercy of his critics.\r\n\r\n"I quite forgot--of course," said he hurriedly; "I--I--"\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Wally, hurriedly shoving a pocket-comb into his hands;\r\n"you\'d better go downstairs again and change it sharp, or you\'ll be\r\nspotted.  Cut along."\r\n\r\nSo Fisher minor began with shame to look once more for his fork, and in\r\ndoing so crawled well under the table, and sitting down proceeded\r\nnervously and painfully to open up a parting on the left side of his\r\nhead.  It was an arduous task, and not made easier by the unjustifiable\r\nconduct of the twins, who having got their man safe under hatches began\r\nto kick out in an unceremonious fashion and basely betray his retreat to\r\ntheir friends and neighbours.\r\n\r\n"Pass him on!"\r\n\r\n"Hack it through!"\r\n\r\n"Ware cats!" was the cry, in the midst of which the luckless Fisher\r\nminor, finding a return to his old place effectually barred, and\r\nwearying of the ceremony of running a gauntlet of all the legs along the\r\ntable before it was half over, made a hasty selection of what seemed to\r\nhim the mildest pair within reach, and clutching at them convulsively,\r\nhung on for dear life.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the limbs in question was Ranger, a prefect of his house\r\nand more or less of a grandee at Fellsgarth.  As he was unaware of the\r\ncause of the excitement around him, this sudden assault from below took\r\nhim aback, and he started up from his chair in something as near a panic\r\nas a Fellsgarth prefect could be capable of.  Naturally his parasite\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\nTo Ranger\'s credit, he took in the situation rapidly, and did not abuse\r\nhis opportunities.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?" he demanded, lifting up Fisher minor, with his hair all\r\non end and the pocket-comb still in his hand, by the coat-collar.  "Who\r\ndoes this belong to?"\r\n\r\nNo one in particular owned the object in question.\r\n\r\n"What are you?" asked the prefect.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Fisher minor; I got under the table, somehow."\r\n\r\n"So I should suppose.  Afraid of the draughts, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"It was Wally and his brother put me there.  I didn\'t mean--"\r\n\r\n"Oh--Wally, was it?  Here, young Wheatfield, you shouldn\'t leave your\r\nproperty about like this.  It\'s against rules.  Here, hook on, and don\'t\r\ngo chucking it about any more."\r\n\r\n"All serene," said the twin.  "Come along, kid.  Done with my comb?  You\r\nlook ever so much better form now; doesn\'t he, you chaps?  How came you\r\nto lose your way downstairs?"\r\n\r\nFisher minor owned himself utterly unable to account for the\r\nmisadventure, and discreetly remained silent until the signal was given\r\nto return thanks and separate every boy to his own house.\r\n\r\nAs he was wandering across the court, very dismal and apprehensive of\r\nwhat more was in store for him, a lean youth with a pale face and very\r\nshowily attired accosted him.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, kid, are you a new chap?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Fisher minor, eyeing the stranger suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"What side are you on?"\r\n\r\nFisher stared interrogatively.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, are you Modern or Classic?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, really," said Fisher minor, wishing he knew which he\r\nought to proclaim himself.  Then making a bold venture, he said, "I\r\nbelieve Modern."\r\n\r\n"Good job for you," said the youth; "saves me the trouble of kicking\r\nyou.  Can you lend me a bob?  I\'ll give it you back to-morrow as soon as\r\nI\'ve unpacked."\r\n\r\nIt did strike Fisher minor as queer that any one should pack shillings\r\nup in a trunk, but he was too pleased to oblige this important and\r\nfashionable-looking personage to raise any question.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Can you give me change out of a half-crown?  Or you can pay me\r\nthe lot back to-morrow, I shan\'t be wanting it till then," said he.\r\n\r\n"All serene, kid; I\'m glad you are our side.  I shall be able to give\r\nyou a leg-up with the fellows.  Whose house are you in?"\r\n\r\n"Wakefield\'s, the same as my brother."\r\n\r\n"What--then you must be a Classic!  They\'re all Classics at Wakefield\'s.\r\nWhy can\'t you tell the truth when you\'re asked, instead of a howling\r\npack of lies?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know, really, I thought--"\r\n\r\n"Come, that\'s a good one.  Any idiot knows what side he\'s on at\r\nFellsgarth."\r\n\r\nFisher minor was greatly confused to stand convicted thus of greenness.\r\n\r\n"You see," said he, putting on a little "side" to cover his shame, "I\r\nwas bound to be stuck on the same side as my brother, you know."\r\n\r\n"Nice for you.  Not a gentleman among them.  All paupers and prigs,"\r\nsaid this young Modern, waxing eloquent.  "You\'ll suit them down to the\r\nground."  Considering that Fisher minor had just lent the speaker half a\r\ncrown, these taunts struck him as not exactly grateful.  At the same\r\ntime he writhed under the reproach, and felt convinced that Classics\r\nwere not at all the "form" at Fellsgarth.\r\n\r\n"Why," pursued the other, pocketing his coin in order to release his\r\nhands for a little elocution, "we could boy \'em up twice over.  The\r\nworkhouse isn\'t in it with Wakefield\'s.  There\'s not a day but they come\r\ncadging to us, wanting to borrow our tin, or our grub, or something.\r\nThere, look at that chap going across there!  He\'s one of \'em.  Regular\r\ncasual-ward form about him.  He\'s the meanest, stingiest lout in all\r\nFellsgarth."\r\n\r\n"Why," exclaimed Fisher minor, looking in alarm towards this prodigy of\r\nbaseness, "why, that\'s--that\'s Fisher, my brother!"\r\n\r\nThe Modern youth\'s jaw fell with a snap, and his cheeks lost what little\r\ncolour they had.\r\n\r\n"What?  Why didn\'t you tell me!  Look here, you needn\'t tell him what I\r\nsaid.  It was quite between ourselves, you know.  I must be cutting, I\r\nsay.  See you again some day."\r\n\r\nAnd he vanished, leaving Fisher minor considerably more bewildered, and\r\npoorer by a cool half-crown, than he had been five minutes ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nLAMB\'S SINGING.\r\n\r\nWakefield\'s house, as Fisher minor entered it under his brother\'s wing,\r\nhardly seemed to the new boy as disreputable a haunt as his recent\r\nModern friend had led him to expect.  Nor did the sixty or seventy\r\nfellows who clustered in the common room strike him as exactly the\r\nlowest stratum of Fellsgarth society.  Yorke, the captain, for instance,\r\nwith his serene, well-cut face, his broad shoulders and impressive voice\r\nhardly answered to the description of a lout.  Nor did Ranger, of the\r\nlong legs, with speed written in every inch of his athletic figure, and\r\ngentleman in every line of his face, look the sort of fellow to be\r\nmistaken for a cad.  Even Fisher major, about whom the younger brother\r\nhad been made to feel decided qualms, could hardly have been the hail-\r\nfellow-well-met he was with everybody, had he been all the new boy\'s\r\ninformant had recently described him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Fisher minor, when presently he gathered himself together\r\nsufficiently to look round him, was surprised to see so few traces of\r\nthe "casual-ward" in his new house.  True, most of the fellows might be\r\npoor--which, of course, was highly reprehensible; and some of them might\r\nnot be connected with the nobility, which showed a great lack of proper\r\nfeeling on their part.  But as a rule they held up their heads and\r\nseemed to think very well of themselves and one another; while their\r\ndress, if it was not in every case as fashionable as that of the\r\ntemporary owner of Fisher minor\'s half-crown, was at least passably well\r\nfitting.\r\n\r\nFisher minor, for all his doubts about the company he was in, could not\r\nhelp half envying these fellows, as he saw with what glee and self-\r\nsatisfaction they entered into their own at Wakefield\'s.  They were all\r\nso glad to be back, to see again the picture of Cain and Abel on the\r\nwall, to scramble for the corner seat in the ingle-bench, to hear the\r\nwell-known creak on the middle landing, to catch the imperturbable tick\r\nof the dormitory clock, to see the top of Hawk\'s Pike looming out, down\r\nthe valley, clear and sharp in the falling light.\r\n\r\nFisher minor and Ashby, as they sat dismally and watched all the fun,\r\nwondered if the time would ever come when they would feel as much at\r\nhome as all this.  It was a stretch of imagination beyond their present\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nTo their alarm, Master Wally Wheatfield presently recognised them from\r\nacross the room, and came over patronisingly to where they sat.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, new kids! thinking of your mas, and the rocking-horses, and\r\nNurse Jane, and all that?  Never mind, have a good blub, it\'ll do you\r\ngood."\r\n\r\nConsidering how near, in strict secrecy, both the young gentlemen\r\naddressed were to the condition indicated by the genial twin, this\r\nexhortation was not exactly kind.\r\n\r\nThey tried to look as if they did not mind it, and Fisher minor\r\nnaturally did his best to appear knowing.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind," said he, with a snigger; "they\'re all milksops at home.\r\nI\'d sooner be here."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t," put in the sturdy Ashby.  "I think it\'s horrid not to see\r\na face you know."\r\n\r\n"There you are; what did I say!  Screaming for his mammy," gibed Wally.\r\n\r\n"And if I was," retorted Master Ashby, warming up, "she\'s a lot better\r\nworth it than yours, so now!"\r\n\r\nMaster Wally naturally fired up at this.  Such language was hardly\r\nrespectful from a new junior to an old.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pull your nose, new kid, if you cheek me."\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll pull yours, if you cheek my mother."\r\n\r\n"Booh, booh, poor baby!  Who\'s cheeking your mother?  I wouldn\'t cheek\r\nher with a pair of tongs.  Something better to do.  I say, are both you\r\nkids Classics?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," they replied.\r\n\r\n"I thought you must be Moderns, you\'re both so precious green.  All\r\nright, there\'ll be lamb\'s singing directly, then you\'ll have to sit up."\r\n\r\n"What\'s lamb\'s singing?" said Ashby.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know?" replied Wally, glad to have recovered the whip hand.\r\n"It\'s this way.  Every new kid has to sing in his house the first-night.\r\nYou\'ll have to."\r\n\r\n"Oh," faltered Ashby, "I can\'t; I don\'t know anything."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t get out of it; you must," said the twin, charmed to see the\r\ntorture he was inflicting.  "So must you, Hair-parting."\r\n\r\nFisher minor was too knowing a hand to be caught napping.  He had had\r\nthe tip about lamb\'s singing from his brother last term, and was\r\nprepared.  He joined in, therefore, against Ashby.\r\n\r\n"What, didn\'t you know that, kid?  You must be green.  _I_ knew it all\r\nalong."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," said Wheatfield.  "Now I\'m going.  I can\'t fool away\r\nall my evening with you.  By the way, mind you don\'t get taking up with\r\nany Modern kids.  It\'s not allowed, and you\'ll get it hot if you do.  My\r\nyoung brother," (each twin was particularly addicted to casting\r\nreflections on his brother\'s age) "is a Modern.  Don\'t you have anything\r\nto do with him.  And whatever you do, don\'t lend any of them money, or\r\nthere\'ll be a most awful row.  That\'s why we always call up\r\nsubscriptions for the house clubs on first-night.  It cleans the fellows\r\nout, and then they can\'t lend any to the Moderns.  You\'ll have to shell\r\nout pretty soon, as soon as Lamb\'s singing is over.  Ta, ta."\r\n\r\nThis last communication put Fisher minor in a terrible panic.  He had\r\nevidently committed a gross breach of etiquette in lending that Modern\r\nboy (whose name he did not even know) a half-crown; and now, when the\r\nsubscriptions were called for, he would have to declare himself before\r\nall Wakefield\'s a pauper.\r\n\r\n"I say," said he to Ashby, dropping the patronising for the pathetic,\r\n"could you ever lend me half-a-crown?  I\'ve--I\'ve lost mine--I\'ll pay it\r\nyou back next week faithfully."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve only got five bob," said Ashby; "to last all the term, and half a\r\ncrown of that will go in the clubs to-night."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll get it back in a week--really you will," pleaded Fisher\r\nminor, "and I\'ll--"\r\n\r\nBut here there was a sudden interruption.  Every one, from the captain\r\ndown, looked towards the new boys, and a shout of "lamb\'s singing,"\r\nheaded by Wally Wheatfield, left little doubt as to what it all meant.\r\n\r\n"Pass up the new kids down there," called one of the prefects.\r\nWhereupon Fisher minor and Ashby, rather pale and very nervous, were\r\nhustled up to the top of the room, where sat the grandees in a row round\r\nthe table on which the sacrifice was to take place.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of the curious it may be explained that "lamb\'s\r\nsinging," the name applied to the musical performances of new boys at\r\nFellsgarth on first-night, is supposed to have derived its title from\r\nthe frequency with which these young gentlemen fell back upon "Mary had\r\na little lamb" as their theme on such occasions.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t one of them your minor?" asked Yorke of Fisher senior.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the latter rather apologetically; "the one with the light\r\nhair.  He\'s not much to look at.  The fact is, I only know him slightly.\r\nThey say at home he\'s a nice boy."\r\n\r\n"Does he spend much of his time under tables, as a rule?" asked Ranger,\r\nrecognising the lost property which had hung on to his legs at dinner-\r\ntime.  "If so, I\'ll take the other one for my fag."\r\n\r\n"He\'s bagged already," said Denton.  "Fisher and I put our names down\r\nfor him an hour ago."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s cool.  If Fisher wanted a fag he might as well have taken\r\nhis own minor."\r\n\r\n"Fisher major knew better," said the gentleman in question.  "It might\r\nraise awkward family questions if I had him."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t it be fairer to toss up?" suggested the captain.  "Or I don\'t\r\nmind swopping Wally Wheatfield for him; if you really--"\r\n\r\nRanger laughed.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, I draw the line at Wally.  I wouldn\'t deprive you of him\r\nfor the world.  I suppose I must have this youngster.  Let\'s hear him\r\nsing first."\r\n\r\n"Yes, lamb\'s singing.  Now, you two, one at a time.  Who\'s first?\r\nAlphabetical order."\r\n\r\nAshby, with an inward groan, mounted the rostrum.  If anything could\r\nhave been more cruel than the noise which greeted his appearance, it was\r\nthe dead silence which followed it.  Fellows sat round, staring him out\r\nof countenance with critical faces, and rejoicing in his embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the title!" demanded some one.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know any songs," said Ashby presently, "and I can\'t sing."\r\n\r\n"Ho, ho! we\'ve heard that before.  Come, forge ahead."\r\n\r\n"I only know the words of one that my con--somebody I know--sings,\r\ncalled the _Vigil_.  I don\'t know the tune."\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t matter--out with it."\r\n\r\nSo Ashby, pulling himself desperately together, plunged recklessly into\r\nthe following appropriate ditty; which, failing its proper tune, he\r\nmanfully set at the top of his voice, and with all the energy he was\r\ncapable of, to the air of the _Vicar of Bray_--\r\n\r\n  The stealthy night creeps o\'er the lea,\r\n  My darling, haste away with me.\r\n  Beloved, come I see where I stand,\r\n  With arms outstretched upon the strand.\r\n\r\n  The night creeps on; my love is late,\r\n  O love, my love, I wait, I wait;\r\n  The soft wind sighs mid crag and pine;\r\n  Haste, O my sweet; be mine, be mine!\r\n\r\nThis spirited song, the last two lines of which were aught up as a\r\nchorus, fairly brought down the house; and Ashby, much to his surprise,\r\nfound himself famous.  He had no idea he could sing so well, or that the\r\nfellows would like the words as much as they seemed to do.  Yet they\r\ncheered him and encored him, and yelled the chorus till the roof almost\r\nfell in.\r\n\r\n"Bravo," shouted every one, the captain himself included, as he\r\ndescended from the table; "that\'s a ripping song."\r\n\r\n"That sends up the price of our fag, I fancy," said Denton to his chum.\r\n"Your young brother won\'t beat that."\r\n\r\n"Next man in," shouted Wheatfield, hustling forward Fisher minor.  "Now,\r\nkid, lamm it on and show them what you can do."\r\n\r\n"Title! title!" cried the meeting.\r\n\r\nNow, if truth must be told, Fisher minor had come to Fellsgarth\r\ndetermined that whatever else he failed in, he would make a hit at\r\n"lamb\'s singing."  He had made a careful calculation as to what sort of\r\nsong would go down with the company and at the same time redeem his\r\nreputation from all suspicion of greenness; and he flattered himself he\r\nhad hit upon the exact article.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said he, with an attempt at offhand swagger, in response to the\r\ndemand.  "It\'s a comic song, called _Oh no_."\r\n\r\nIt disconcerted him a little to see how seriously everybody settled down\r\nto listen, and how red his brother\'s face turned as he took a back seat\r\namong the seniors.  Never mind.  Wait till they heard his song.  That\r\nwould fetch them!\r\n\r\nHe had carefully studied not only the song but the appropriate action.\r\nAs he knew perfectly well, there is one invariable attitude for a comic\r\nsong.  The head must be tilted a little to one side.  One eyebrow must\r\nbe raised and the opposite corner of the mouth turned down.  One knee\r\nshould be slightly bent; the first finger and thumb of one hand should\r\nrest gracefully in the waistcoat pocket, and the other hand should be\r\nfree for gesture.\r\n\r\nAll these points Fisher minor attended to now as carefully as his\r\nnervousness would permit, and felt half amused at the thought of how\r\ncomic the fellows must think him.\r\n\r\n"Do you--" he began.\r\n\r\nBut at this point Ranger unfeelingly interrupted, and put the vocalist\r\ncompletely out.\r\n\r\n"Did you say `Oh no\' or `How now\'?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no," repeated the singer.\r\n\r\n"You mean h-o-w n-o-w?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; it\'s o-h n-o."\r\n\r\n"Thanks--sorry to interrupt.  Fire away."  Fisher tried to get himself\r\nback into attitude, and began again in a thin treble voice;--\r\n\r\nDo you think I\'m just as green as grass!  Oh no!\r\n\r\nDo you take me for a silly ass!  Oh no!  Do you think I don\'t know A\r\nfrom B!  Do you think I can\'t tell he from she!  Do you think I swallow\r\nall I see?\r\n\r\nOh no--not me!  He was bewildered by the unearthly silence of his\r\naudience.  No one stirred a muscle except Wheatfield, who was apparently\r\nwiping away a tear.  Was the song too deep for them, or perhaps he did\r\nnot sing the words distinctly, or perhaps they _had_ laughed and he had\r\nnot noticed?  At any rate he would try the next verse, which was certain\r\nto amuse them.  He looked as droll as he could, and by way of\r\nheightening the effect, stuck his two thumbs into the armholes of his\r\nwaistcoat and wagged his hands in time with the song.\r\n\r\nDo you think I lie abed all day?\r\n\r\nOh no!  Do you guess I skate on ice in May?\r\n\r\nOh no!  Do you think I can\'t tell what is what?  Do you think I don\'t\r\nknow pepper\'s hot?  Or whereabouts my i\'s to dot?\r\n\r\nOh no, no rot!\r\n\r\nAs he concluded, Fisher minor summoned up enough resolution to shake his\r\nhead and lay one finger to his nose in the most approved style of\r\ncomedy, and then awaited the result.\r\n\r\nFellows apparently did not take in that the song was at an end, for they\r\nneither cheered nor smiled.  So Fisher minor made an elaborate bow to\r\nshow it was all over.  The result was the same.  A gloomy silence\r\nprevailed, in the midst of which the singer, never more perplexed in his\r\nlife, descended from the table and proceeded to look out for the\r\ncongratulations of his admirers.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful song," said Wally, still mopping his face.\r\n\r\n"I never thought I could be so touched by anything.  We generally get\r\ncomic songs on first-night."\r\n\r\n"This _is_ a comic one," said Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"Go on," said Wheatfield; "tell that to D\'Arcy here--he\'ll believe you--\r\neh, D\'Arcy?"  D\'Arcy looked mysterious.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no laughing matter, young Wheatfield," said he, in a loud whisper,\r\nevidently intended for the eager ears of Fisher minor.  "I heard Yorke\r\njust now ask Denton if he thought Fisher\'s minor was all there.  Denton\r\nseemed quite cut up, and said he hadn\'t known it before, but it must be\r\na great family trouble to the Fishers.  It accounted for Fisher major\'s\r\nfrequent low spirits.  You know," continued D\'Arcy confidentially, "I\r\ncan\'t help myself thinking it\'s a little rough on Fisher major for his\r\npeople to send a minor who\'s afflicted like this to Fellsgarth.  They\r\nmight at least have put him on the Modern side.  He\'d have been better\r\nunderstood there."\r\n\r\nThis speech Fisher minor listened to with growing perplexity.  Was\r\nD\'Arcy in jest or earnest?  He seemed to be in earnest, and the serious\r\nfaces of his listeners looked like it too.  Had the captain really made\r\nthat remark to Denton?  Suppose there _was_ something in it!  Suppose,\r\nwithout his knowing, he was really a little queer in his head!  His\r\npeople might have told him of it.  And Fisher major, his brother--even\r\nhe hadn\'t heard of it!  Oh dear! oh dear!  How was he ever to recover\r\nhis reputation for sanity?  Whatever induced him to sing that song?\r\n\r\nPoor Fisher minor devoutly wished himself home again, within reach of\r\nhis mother\'s soothing voice and his sisters\' smiles.  _They_ understood\r\nhim.  These fellows didn\'t.  _They_ knew he was not an idiot.  These\r\nfellows didn\'t.\r\n\r\nFurther reflection was cut short by a loud call to order and cheers, as\r\nYorke, the captain, rose to his feet.\r\n\r\nEvery one liked Yorke.  As captain of the School even the Moderns looked\r\nup to him, and were forced to admit that he was a credit to Fellsgarth.\r\nIn Wakefield\'s, his own house, he was naturally an idol.  Prodigious\r\nstories were afloat as to his wisdom and his prowess.  Examiners were\r\nreported to have rent their clothes in despair at his answers; and at\r\nfootball, rumour had it that once, in one of the out-matches against\r\nRidgmoor, he had run the ball down the field with six of the other side\r\non his back, and finished up with a drop at the goal from thirty yards.\r\n\r\nBut his popularity in his own house depended less on these exploits than\r\non his general good-nature and incorruptible fairness.  He scorned to\r\nhit an opponent when he was down, and yet he would knock down a friend\r\nas soon as a foe if the credit of the School required it.  A few,\r\nindeed, there were whose habit it was to sneer at Yorke for being what\r\nthey called "a saint."  The captain of Fellsgarth would have been the\r\nlast to claim such a title for himself; yet those who knew him best knew\r\nthat in all he did, even in the common concerns of daily school life, he\r\nrelied on the guidance and help of a Divine Friend, and was not ashamed\r\nto own his faith.\r\n\r\nThe one drawback to his character in the eyes of certain of his fellow-\r\nprefects and others at Wakefield\'s was that in the standing feud between\r\nClassics and Moderns he would take no part.  He demanded the allegiance\r\nof all parties on behalf of the School, and if any man refused it, Yorke\r\nwas the sort of person who would make it his business to know the reason\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nNow as he got up and waited for the cheers to cease, no one could deny\r\nthat he wasn\'t as fine a captain as Wakefield\'s could expect to see for\r\nmany a day.  And for the first time some of those who even feared him\r\nrealised with a qualm that this was the last "first-night" on which he\r\nwould be there to make the usual speech.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," he said, "we are all glad to be back in the old place,"\r\n(cheers).  "At any rate I am," (loud cheers).  "On first-night, as you\r\nknow, we always combine business with pleasure.  We have just had the\r\npleasure," (laughter, in the midst of which Fisher minor pricked up his\r\nears and wondered if his song wasn\'t going to be appreciated after all).\r\n"The lambs have bleated and done their level best, I\'m sure," (renewed\r\nlaughter, and cries of "How now?").  "Now for the business.  Gentlemen,\r\nthe house clubs demand your support."  (Fisher minor turned deadly green\r\nas he remembered the Modern boy and his half-crown.  He looked round\r\nwildly for Ashby, but Ashby was standing between Wally and D\'Arcy, and\r\nthe proximity was not encouraging for Fisher\'s purpose.  The idea\r\noccurred to him of appealing to his brother.  But Fisher major, pen in\r\nhand, sat at the receipt of custom, and he dare not approach).  "We hope\r\nthere will be no shirking.  Every fellow in the house is expected to\r\nback up the clubs.  If the House clubs are not kept up to the mark, the\r\nSchool clubs are sure to go down," (cheers).  "We don\'t ask much.  The\r\nseniors pay 5 shillings, the middle-boys 3 shillings 6 pence, and the\r\njuniors 2 shillings 6 pence."  (Fisher minor glanced frantically in the\r\ndirection of the door, and began to edge that way.) "Now, gentlemen, one\r\nword more.  You know, last term, there was a lot of bad blood between\r\nClassics and Moderns," (great cheers and three groans for the Moderns).\r\n"Of course it\'s open to any idiot who likes to make a fool of himself,\r\nand quarrel with anybody he likes.  He\'s welcome to do it up to a\r\ncertain point, if it gives him pleasure.  But I want to say this--and\r\nI\'d say it if the whole of the school was here--that if these rows once\r\nbegin to interfere with the honour of the School in sports or anything\r\nelse, as they nearly did last term, the fellows who indulge in them will\r\nbe dropped on pretty heavily, no matter what side or what house they\r\nbelong to."\r\n\r\nThe captain looked so uncommonly like meaning what he said, that D\'Arcy,\r\nwho had already made an appointment to fight Lickford, a Modern boy, at\r\nthe Three Oaks before breakfast to-morrow, quailed under his eye, and\r\nwondered if he could with dignity "scratch" the engagement.\r\n\r\nA general movement towards the table at which Fisher major sat with his\r\npen and account-book followed the captain\'s speech.  Of all the company\r\npresent, only one failed to enrol himself.  He was a new boy called\r\nFisher minor, who, evidently worn out by the fatigues of the day and\r\nunversed in the etiquette of first-night, had sought the dame at a\r\nsomewhat early hour, and received her permission to go to bed.\r\n\r\nSuch at least was that lady\'s version when Fisher major, having missed\r\nhis minor, made inquiries respecting his absence.\r\n\r\n"Best thing he could do, to make himself scarce, after such a\r\nperformance," said the elder brother to Denton, who accompanied him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, I envy Ranger his fag.  It\'s a lucky thing we bagged the\r\nother one in time."\r\n\r\n"The young donkey couldn\'t be in better hands," said Fisher; "but I say,\r\nDen, didn\'t the captain come down rather heavy with his thunder to-\r\nnight?  What does it all mean?"\r\n\r\n"Bows, I expect," said Denton.  "He\'s not going to stand what went on\r\nlast term, and I\'m jolly glad of it.  We must back him up."\r\n\r\n"If he means I\'m not to feel inclined to kick Dangle whenever I see him,\r\nI can\'t promise him much."\r\n\r\n"Dangle\'s a good quarter-mile man, and a good long-stop.  If your\r\nkicking him prevents his playing for the School, you\'ll have to mind\r\nyour eye, my boy.  That\'s what he means."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" grunted Fisher major, "I suppose the rows will begin to-morrow,\r\nwhen we elect the officers for the School clubs.  Those fellows are sure\r\nto want to stick their own men in."\r\n\r\n"At any rate you\'re safe enough for treasurer, old man.  But come, I\'m\r\ndead sleepy to-night.  Time enough for rows to-morrow and the next day."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nCANVASSING.\r\n\r\nWhen Fisher major woke early next morning he had the curious sensation\r\nof something on his mind without knowing what it was.\r\n\r\nHe was not out of sorts.  The private supper of which he and Denton and\r\nRidgway had partaken last night in Ranger\'s study had been wholesome, if\r\nmiscellaneous.  Ranger\'s people had given him a hamper to bring back,\r\ncontaining a good many good things--cake, biscuits, potted meats, jam,\r\nWorcester sauce, pickles, coffee, and other groceries intended to\r\ndiversify the breakfasts of the half.  By some error of judgment this\r\nvaluable article of luggage had come from town in the van, where it had\r\napparently been placed at the very bottom of the baggage.  The\r\nconsequence was, that when it came to be opened, its several ingredients\r\nwere found to have got loose, and fused together in a most hopeless way.\r\nJam, and pickles, and Liebig\'s extract, and moist sugar were\r\nindistinguishable.  The only thing seemed to be to attack the concoction\r\n_en masse_, without needless delay, and to that end Ranger had summoned\r\nthe assistance of his friends and neighbours.  Fisher major was unable\r\nto attribute any part of the weight on his mind to this perfectly\r\nwholesome and homely refreshment.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?  It was not Denton.  He had come back as loyal and festive\r\nas ever, threatening to work hard this half, and determined to have\r\nFisher major as his guest at the rectory on the lake for the Christmas\r\nvac.\r\n\r\nNor was it the captain\'s speech last night that bothered him.  True, it\r\nwas not altogether conciliatory to those, who, like Fisher major, were\r\nresolved to have no truce with the enemy.  Of course it was the right\r\nthing for Yorke to say.  But Yorke knew, as well as anybody, that the\r\nClassics meant to keep their house Cock-House at Fellsgarth.\r\n\r\nNor was it the accounts; although Fisher minor had to own to himself he\r\nwas not a grand hand at finance, and that if he was appointed treasurer\r\nof the School clubs, as well as of his House clubs, he would have his\r\nwork cut out for him to keep both funds clear and solvent.\r\n\r\nWhat then was it?  His young brother?  He supposed it must be.  The\r\nyoung donkey had made a bad beginning at Fellsgarth--which was bad\r\nenough.  But had the elder brother done quite the decent thing in half\r\ndisowning him, and letting him run on his fate in the way he had?  A\r\nlittle brotherly backing up, a word or two of warning, and, if needs be,\r\na little timely intimidation, might have made all the difference to the\r\nyoungster, and would not have done the senior much harm.\r\n\r\nYes; it was this precious minor of his who was on Fisher major\'s mind.\r\nIt was too late, of course, to pick up the milk already spilled.  But it\r\nmight be worth while to give him a word of admonition as to his future\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nWith this view he sent Ashby (who, with all the alacrity of a brand-new\r\nfag, punctually presented himself for orders before getting-up bell had\r\nceased ringing) to summon Fisher minor to his brother\'s room.\r\n\r\n"Well, kid," said the elder brother, commencing his toilet, "how did you\r\nget on?  Sleep well?"\r\n\r\n"Middling," said Fisher minor.  "Some of the fellows had put pepper on\r\nthe blankets, and it got into my eyes--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good job they did nothing worse."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Fisher minor, who was evidently in a limp state, and had\r\nnot at all enjoyed his night, "they _did_ tease a good deal."\r\n\r\n"Humph--who did!"\r\n\r\n"Well, there was that boy they call--"\r\n\r\n"Stop," said Fisher major, turning round fiercely in the middle of\r\nbrushing his hair; "do you mean to say you don\'t know that it\'s only\r\ncads who sneak about one another?"\r\n\r\n"But you asked me."\r\n\r\n"Of course I did, and made sure you wouldn\'t let out.  I hope they\'ll\r\ngive you a few more lively nights, to teach you better."\r\n\r\nThe young brother\'s lips gave an ominous quiver at this unfeeling\r\nspeech, and he horrified Fisher major by betraying imminent symptoms of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Joey," said the senior, rather more soothingly, "you\'ve made\r\na jolly bad start, and that can\'t be helped.  The mistake you made is in\r\nthinking you know everything, whereas you\'re about as green as they make\r\nthem.  Why ever do you pretend not to be?  Look at that other new kid--\r\nthe other one who sang.  He\'s green too; but, bless you, it\'s no crime,\r\nand all the fellows take to him because he doesn\'t put on side like you.\r\nWhy, that song you sang--oh, my stars!--what on _earth_ put that rot\r\ninto your head?"\r\n\r\nThis finished up poor Fisher minor.  The recollection of his performance\r\nlast night was more than he could stand, and he began to whimper.\r\n\r\n"Come, old chap," said Fisher major, kindly, patting him on the\r\nshoulder; "perhaps it\'s not all your fault.  I suppose I ought to have\r\ngiven you a leg-up, and prevented you making a fool of yourself.  You\'ll\r\nget on right enough if you don\'t swagger.  And in any case, don\'t\r\nblubber."\r\n\r\n"I shall never get on here," said the new boy.  "All the fellows are\r\nagainst me.  Besides--I didn\'t know it was wrong; and--oh, Tom?--I lent\r\na fellow half a crown, and now I\'ve nothing to pay for the clubs!"\r\n\r\nFisher major laughed.\r\n\r\n"I thought from your tones you were going to confess a murder, at least.\r\nYou\'d better look alive and get the half-crown back."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it.  I lent it in the dark to a--a Modern chap; and I don\'t\r\nknow his name."\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour, Joey, you are a-- Well, it\'s no good saying what you\r\nare.  I hope you\'ll see your money again, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nFisher minor groaned.\r\n\r\n"Would you ever mind lending me half-a-crown for the clubs, just this\r\nonce?" he pleaded.\r\n\r\n"Very convenient arrangement.  I suppose I shall have to.  At least I\'ll\r\nmark you as paid; and if you\'ve not got back what you\'ve lent your\r\nfriend before I have to shell out, I shall have to pay it for you."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Tom; you\'re an awful brick," said the younger brother,\r\nbrightening up rapidly.  "I say, I wish I could be your fag.  Couldn\'t\r\nI?"\r\n\r\n"Ranger\'s bagged you--you\'ll get on better with him than me.  He won\'t\r\nstand as much nonsense as I might.  There! he is calling.  Cut along,\r\nand don\'t go making such an ass of yourself again.  You\'ll have to get\r\non the best you can with your fellows; I can\'t interfere with them\r\nunless they break rules, you know.  You can come in here, of course, any\r\ntime you like, and if you want a leg-up with preparation, and Ranger\'s\r\nbusy, you may as well do your work here."\r\n\r\nAfter this Fisher major felt a little easier in his conscience, and was\r\nable to face the tasks of the day with a lighter mind than if he had had\r\nthe care of his minor upon it all the time.\r\n\r\nThe school work of the day was not particularly onerous.  Dr Ringwood,\r\nthe head-master, held a sort of reception of the Sixth, and delivered,\r\nas was his wont, a little lecture on the work to be taken up during the\r\nensuing half, interspersed with a few sarcastic references to the work\r\nof the previous half, and one or two jokes, which scoffers like Ridgway\r\nused to say must have cost him many serious hours during the holidays to\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n"Aristophanes," said the head-master, after calling attention to the\r\nparticular merits of the Greek play to be undertaken, "did not write\r\nsolely for the Sixth form of a public school.  I am afraid some of you,\r\nlast term, thought that Euripides did.  He will require more than usual\r\nattention.  I am sure he can easily receive it.  I would not, if I were\r\nyou boys, be too chary this term of extra work.  Some of you are almost\r\npainfully conscientious in your objection to overdo a particular study.\r\nAristophanes is an author with whom liberties may safely be taken in\r\nthis respect.  The test of a good classical scholar, remember, is not\r\nthe work he is obliged to do, but what he is not obliged to do--his\r\nextra work; I advise you not to be afraid to try it.  The Sanatorium has\r\nbeen unusually free of cases of over-pressure lately.  A quarter of an\r\nhour\'s extra work a day by the Sixth is not at all likely to tax its\r\ncapacity," etcetera.\r\n\r\nThis was the doctor\'s pleasant style, delivered with a severe face and\r\ndowncast eyes.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a little lecture to the prefects on their duties and\r\nresponsibilities, which was respectfully listened to.  To judge by it,\r\nsuch a thing as any rumour of dissensions between rival sides and houses\r\nin the school had never reached his ears.  And yet the knowing ones said\r\nthe doctor knew better than the captain himself everything that went on\r\nin Fellsgarth, and could at any moment lay his hand on an offender.  But\r\nhe preferred to leave the police of the place to his head boys; and on\r\nthe whole it was perhaps better for the School that he did.\r\n\r\nTo a larger or less degree the other forms, Classic and Modern, were\r\nlectured in similar strains by their respective masters.  The new boys\r\namong the junior division were, perhaps, the only ones who listened\r\nattentively to what Mr Stratton, the young, cheery athlete who presided\r\nover their studies, had to say.  And even the irrespectful admiration\r\nwas a good deal distracted by the babel of voices which was going on all\r\nround them.\r\n\r\n"Never mind him," said D\'Arcy; "he\'s a kid of a master, and don\'t know\r\nany better.  It\'s all rot.  Bless you, we get the same thing--"\r\n\r\n"D\'Arcy," said the master, suddenly, "I was recommending the value of\r\nextra work, especially for clever boys.  Perhaps you will try the\r\nexperiment with fifty lines of Virgil by this time to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"There you are," said D\'Arcy, appealing to his neighbours; "didn\'t I\r\ntell you he talked rot?  Did you ever hear such a stale joke as that?"\r\n\r\nThe two new boys were tremendously impressed by this sudden swoop of\r\nvengeance, and gazed open-mouthed at the master for the rest of the\r\nclass, stealing only now and again a hasty glance at D\'Arcy to see how\r\nhe was bearing up against his sore afflictions.\r\n\r\nD\'Arcy, to do him justice, appeared to be bearing up very well.  He was,\r\nin truth, engaged in a mental calculation as to how, during the coming\r\nterm, he could most economically "job" out the impositions which usually\r\nfell to his share.  If his countenance now and then brightened as he met\r\nthe awe-struck gaze of the two new boys, it was because in them he\r\nthought he discerned a lively hope of solving the problem creditably to\r\nhimself and not unprofitably to them.\r\n\r\n"Come along," said he as soon as the class was released; "let\'s get out\r\ninto the fresh air and have a cool.  Hullo, Wally," as the owner of that\r\nname trotted up, "what\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"Up?" said Wally in tones of injured innocence; "one would think you\r\ndidn\'t know it was School club elections on in an hour, and all the\r\nchaps to whip up!  If the Moderns turn up in force, it\'ll be touch-and-\r\ngo if they don\'t carry every man.  I can\'t stop now--mind you bring\r\nthose kids."\r\n\r\nAnd off he went with all the importance of captain\'s fag on his\r\nelectioneering tour.\r\n\r\n"Wally\'s right," said D\'Arcy.  "It\'ll be a close shave to carry our men.\r\nYou see, kids," added he condescendingly, "it\'s just this way.  The\r\nModerns are going to try to carry the clubs to-day, and if they do, the\r\nwhole of us aren\'t going to stand it, and there\'ll be such a jolly row\r\nin Fellsgarth as--well, wait till you _see_."\r\n\r\nThis sounded very awful.  Fisher minor would have liked to know what\r\nsort of clubs were to be carried, but did not like to ask.  Ashby,\r\nhowever, more honest, demanded further particulars.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean," said he.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t suppose you do.  Whose fault is that?  All you\'ve got to do is to\r\nyell for our side and vote for our men."\r\n\r\nThat seemed simple enough, if D\'Arcy would _only_ vouchsafe to tell them\r\nwhen to begin.\r\n\r\n"Come along," said the latter.  "We\'ve half an hour yet to canvass.  You\r\nknow Wally\'s and my study?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"All right; now you," pointing to Ashby, "you hang outside that door.\r\nThat\'s the Modern minors\' class.  Collar one of them as they come out,\r\nor two if you can; and fetch \'em up to my room.  You," pointing to\r\nFisher minor, "go and prowl about the kids\' gymnasium and fetch any one\r\nwith a blue ribbon on his hat, as many as you can bag.  I\'m going to see\r\nif I can find some of \'em near the tuck-shop.  Kick twice on my door and\r\nsay `Balbus,\' so that I shall know it\'s you.  Go on; off you go.  Don\'t\r\nmuff it, whatever you do, or it\'ll be your fault if Fellsgarth goes to\r\npot."\r\n\r\nAshby, whose uncle was an M.P., had had some little experience in\r\ngeneral elections, but he never remembered canvassing of this kind\r\nbefore.  However, D\'Arcy had an authoritative air about him, and as the\r\nSchool was evidently in peril, and there was no suspicion of practical\r\njoking in the present case, he marched off sturdily to the Modern\r\nminors\' class-room, and sheltering himself conveniently behind the door,\r\nwaited the turn of events.\r\n\r\nHe had not to wait long.  He could hear the master announcing the lesson\r\nfor preparation, and the general shuffle which precedes the dismissal of\r\na class.  Then his heart beat a little faster as he distinguished\r\nfootsteps and heard the unsuspecting enemy approaching his way.\r\n\r\nNow Ashby, although a new boy, was _man_ enough to calculate one or two\r\nthings.  One was that his best chance was either to attack the head or\r\nthe tail of the procession; and secondly, that as the head boys in a\r\nform are usually those nearest the front, and conversely, the lowest are\r\nusually nearest to the door, the smallest boys would probably be the\r\nfirst to come out.  For all of which reasons he decided to make his\r\nswoop at once, and if possible abscond with his booty before the main\r\nbody arrived on the scene.\r\n\r\nThe event justified his shrewdness.  The moment the door opened, two\r\nsmall Moderns scampered out clean into the arms of the expectant\r\nkidnapper, who before they had time so much as to inquire who he was or\r\nwhat he wanted, had a grip on the coat-collar of each, and was racing\r\nthem as hard as their short legs could carry them across the grass.\r\n\r\n"Let go, you cad!" squeaked one, presently.  "What we you doing!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s only fun," said Ashby, encouragingly; "come along."\r\n\r\nThe other prisoner was more practical.  He tried to bite his captor\'s\r\nhand, and when he failed in that, he tried to kick.  But though he\r\nsucceeded better in this, the pace was kept up and the grip on his\r\ncollar, if anything, tightened.  Whereupon he attempted to sit down.\r\nBut that, though it retarded the progress, was still insufficient to\r\narrest it.  The pace dropped to a quick walk, and in due time, greatly\r\nto Ashby\'s relief, the portal of Wakefield\'s was reached.\r\n\r\nHere, of course, all was safe.  If any of the few boys hanging about had\r\nbeen inclined to concern themselves in the affair, the colour of the\r\nribbon on the victims\' hats was quite sufficient reason for allowing the\r\nlaw to take its course; and Ashby, who began to grow very tired of his\r\nburden (which insisted on sitting down on either side all the way\r\nupstairs), arrived at length at Messrs. D\'Arcy and Wally\'s door without\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nHe had no need to knock, or say "Balbus," as the room was empty.  The\r\nother canvassers had evidently not yet returned.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh of relief he deposited his loads on the carpet and locked\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"Let us go, you cad!" yelled the prisoners.  "What do you want bringing\r\nus here into this place for?"\r\n\r\n"Fun," said Ashby.  "You\'ll know presently."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t let us out, we\'ll yell till a master comes."\r\n\r\n"Will you?--we\'re used to yelling here.  Yell away; it\'ll do you good."\r\n\r\nTo the credit of the two "voters" they did their best, and made such a\r\nhideous uproar that Ashby began to grow uneasy, and was immensely\r\nrelieved when presently he heard outside a sound as of coals being\r\ncarelessly carried up the staircase.  Some one was evidently coming up\r\nwith a good load.\r\n\r\nAshby was prudent enough not to open the door till an irregular double\r\nkick and a breathless cry of "Balbus, look sharp," apprised him that\r\nanother of the electioneering agents had returned.  He then cautiously\r\nopened the door, and in tumbled D\'Arcy, gasping, yet triumphant, under\r\nthe weight of three fractious youngsters.\r\n\r\n"Bully for us," said he, surveying the harvest.  "Five for our side.\r\nJolly well done of you, kid--you\'re a stunner.  Two of mine are new\r\nkids--they came easy enough; but the other\'s a regular badger."\r\n\r\nThe badger in question seemed determined to maintain his reputation, for\r\nhe flew upon his captor, calling upon his fellow-prisoners to do the\r\nsame.  All but the new boys obeyed, and the two "canvassers" were very\r\nhard put to it for a while, and might have fared yet worse, had not\r\nD\'Arcy astutely hung out a flag of truce.  "Look here," said he; "I\r\nnever knew such idiots as you Modern kids are.  Here I\'ve done my best\r\nto be friends and invited you to a spread in my room; and now you won\'t\r\neven let me go to the cupboard and get out the black currant jam and\r\ncake."\r\n\r\n"You\'re telling crams; that\'s not why you brought us here.  You\'re a\r\nhowling--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, really," said D\'Arcy, in quite a friendly tone, "Cry _pax_ for one\r\nminute, and if I don\'t hand out the things you may go; honour bright.\r\nI\'ve a good mind to kick you out without giving you anything."\r\n\r\nThe caged animals sullenly fell back and eyed the cupboard which D\'Arcy\r\nleisurely opened.  A row of half a dozen pots on a top shelf, a segment\r\nof a plum-cake, and something that looked very like honey in the comb,\r\nmet their greedy eyes.\r\n\r\n"There you are," said D\'Arcy.  "What did I tell you!  They belong to\r\nWally; he\'ll be here directly.  You\'ll be all right--all except _you_,"\r\nsaid he, singling out his principal assailant.  "You don\'t know how to\r\nbehave, like these other kids.  I shall advise Wally not to waste any of\r\nhis stuff on you."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know it was a feast," said the youth, much softened.  "I\r\nthought you were only humbugging; really I did."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a good mind to do what you think.  You\'d better mind your eye, I\r\ncan tell you--I wish Wally would come.  There\'s five o\'clock striking--\r\nI\'ll go and look for him.  Ashby, you see if he\'s in the library; you\r\nkids, stay here, and lock the door, and don\'t let anybody in but Wally.\r\nDo you hear?  If you do, you\'ll get it pretty hot for being out of your\r\nhouse.  And look here, if Wally doesn\'t come by half-past, you can help\r\nyourselves."\r\n\r\n"Thanks awfully," said the party.\r\n\r\n"Mind! honour bright you don\'t touch a thing till the clock strikes the\r\nhalf.  When you\'ve done, stay here till one of us comes to fetch you,\r\nand we\'ll see you safe out.  Don\'t go without, as our chaps are awfully\r\ndown on Moderns this term, and you\'ll get flayed alive.  If they\'ve seen\r\nyou come in, they\'ll try to get at you, be sure; so lock yourselves in,\r\nwhatever you do, and don\'t make the room in too great a mess.  Come\r\nalong, Ashby; let\'s look for Wally."\r\n\r\n"Cut hard," said he, as soon as they stood outside, and had heard the\r\nlock within duly turned.  "We\'ve only just time to get over; that\'s five\r\nvotes lost to their side!  Real good business!  I wonder where the other\r\nnew kid is?  He was bound to make a mess of it.  That\'s why I sent him\r\nto the gymnasium; it\'s closed to-day."\r\n\r\n"Hooray for the Cock-House!" shouted Ashby, as, side by side with his\r\nnow admiring patron, he entered the School Hall, where the ceremony of\r\nclub elections was just beginning.\r\n\r\nAt the door they encountered Wheatfield.\r\n\r\n"Such games!" whispered D\'Arcy, clapping him joyously on the back.\r\n"We\'ve got five Modern kids boxed up in our room, waiting for the clock\r\nto strike the half-hour before they have a tuck in at our empty jam-\r\npots."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha!" said Wheatfield; "splendid joke!" and vanished.\r\n\r\nD\'Arcy\'s countenance suddenly turned pale as he gripped his companion by\r\nthe arm.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" inquired Ashby, alarmed for his friend\'s health.\r\n"What\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all up!  We\'re regularly done.  My, that _is_ a go!"\r\n\r\n"Whatever do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you blockhead, didn\'t you see that was the wrong Wheatfield--not\r\nWally, but the Modern one!  And now he\'s gone to let those chaps out,\r\nand we\'re clean done for!"\r\n\r\n"Whew! what is to be done?" groaned Ashby, almost as pale as his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nA CLOSE ELECTION.\r\n\r\nEver since certain well-meaning governors, two years ago, had succeeded\r\nin forcing upon Fellsgarth the adoption of a Modern side, the School had\r\nbeen rent by factions whose quarrels sometimes bordered on civil war.\r\nWhen people squabble about the management of a school outside, the boys\r\nare pretty sure to quarrel and take sides against one another inside.\r\n\r\nThe old set, consisting mostly of the Classical boys, felt very sore on\r\nthe question.  It was a case of sentiment, not argument.  If boys, said\r\nthey, wanted to learn science and modern languages, let them; but don\'t\r\nlet them come fooling around at Fellsgarth and spoiling the reputation\r\nof a good old classical school.  There were plenty of schools where\r\nfellows could be brought up in a new-fangled way.  Let them go to one of\r\nthese, and leave Fellsgarth in peace to her dead authors.\r\n\r\nThe boys who used such arguments, it is fair to say, were not always the\r\nmost profound classical scholars.  Most of them, like D\'Arcy and Wally\r\nWheatfield, had a painful acquaintance with the masterpieces of old-\r\nworld literature in the way of impositions, but there their interest\r\nfrequently ended.  The upper Classical boys, however, though not so\r\nnoisily hostile, had their own strong opinions about the new departure;\r\nand when it was discovered that the new Modern side had not only\r\nalienated one or two of their old comrades, but, so far from being\r\napologetic, were disposed to claim equal rights with, and in certain\r\ncases superior privileges to, the old boys, the relations became\r\nstrained all round.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the Modern set consisted of a number of moderate\r\nathletes who could not be wholly ignored in the School sports, and had\r\nno intention of being ignored.  And to add to their crimes they numbered\r\namong them a good number of rich boys, who boasted in public of their\r\nwealth with a freedom which was particularly aggravating to the\r\nClassical seniors, who were for the most part boys to whose parents\r\nmoney was an important consideration.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, the rivalry had been growing acute all last term, and\r\nbut for Yorke\'s determined indifference, it might long ago have come to\r\na rupture.  Now, every one felt that at any moment the peace might be\r\nbroken, and civil war break out between the two sides at Fellsgarth.\r\n\r\nThe School clubs offered a rare opportunity for an exhibition of party\r\nfeeling, for they were the common ground on which every one was bound to\r\nmeet every one else on _level_ terms.\r\n\r\nBy an old rule, every member of the House clubs was a member of the\r\nSchool clubs and had the privilege of electing the committee and\r\nofficers for the year.  It was this business which brought together the\r\ncrowd that flocked into the Hall to-day; and it was in view of this\r\ncritical event that Mr D\'Arcy had carefully shut up five voters of the\r\nother side in his study until the election should be over.\r\n\r\n"Whatever\'s to be done?" asked Ashby, with blank countenance.\r\n\r\n"Nobody but a born idiot would begin to ask riddles just now!" retorted\r\nD\'Arcy surlily.  "Shut up; that\'s what\'s to be done."\r\n\r\n"I expect it will be all right," persisted the dogged Ashby, venturing\r\non a further remark.  "They won\'t let him in, if he\'s not Wally; or if\r\nthey do, they\'ll go for him."\r\n\r\n"I hope they will.  Anyhow we\'ve done our best.  Stick near the door.\r\nWe may be able to bundle a few of \'em out before the voting comes on.\r\nLook out, Yorke\'s speaking.  Yell as hard as you can."\r\n\r\nWhereupon Ashby lay his head back and yelled until D\'Arcy kicked him and\r\ntold him it was time to shut up.\r\n\r\nYorke was moving a resolution that the captains, vice-captains,\r\nsecretaries, and treasurers of each house should form the School sports\r\ncommittee, whose business it would be to arrange matches, keep the\r\nground, make rules, and generally organise the athletics of Fellsgarth.\r\nHe hoped every one would agree to this.\r\n\r\nClapperton, the Modern captain, and head of Forder\'s house, rose to\r\nsecond the motion.\r\n\r\n"Howl away!" said D\'Arcy, nudging his _protege_.  Whereupon Ashby held\r\non to a desk and howled till the windows shook.\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do," shouted D\'Arcy in his ear after a moment or two, and\r\nAshby, thankful for the relief, shut off steam and awaited his next\r\norders.\r\n\r\nClapperton was a big, smirking fellow, rather loudly dressed, with a\r\npersuasive voice and what was intended to be a condescending manner.\r\nSome fellows could never make out why Clapperton did not go down in\r\nFellsgarth.  He tried to be civil, he was lavish with his pocket-money,\r\nand always disclaimed any desire to quarrel with anybody.  And yet no\r\none oared for him, while of course the out-and-out champions of the\r\nrival side hated him.  He seconded with pleasure the motion of "his\r\nfriend Yorke,"--("Cheek!" exclaimed D\'Arcy, _sotto voce_; "what business\r\nhas he to call our captain his friend!") This was the old rule of\r\nFellsgarth, and a very good rule.  It meant hard work, but he was always\r\nglad to do what he could for the old School.  (It always riled the\r\nClassics to hear a Modern talking about "the old School," and their\r\nbacks went up at this.)  He had been on this committee two years now,\r\nand had had the pleasure in a humble way of helping the clubs through\r\none or two of their financial difficulties, and he should be glad to\r\nserve again.  He seconded the motion.\r\n\r\nIt was a trial to one or two who had listened to see that the names were\r\nbeing put to the vote by Yorke _en bloc_, without giving them the chance\r\nof voting against anybody.  Never mind, their chance for that would\r\ncome!\r\n\r\nThe next business was the election of captain of the clubs; and of\r\ncourse Yorke was chosen by acclamation.  No one dared oppose him.  Even\r\n"his friend Clapperton," who had the pleasure of proposing him, was sure\r\nevery one would be as glad as he would to see "his fellow-captain" (oh,\r\nhow the Classics squirmed and ground their teeth at the expression!) at\r\nthe head of the clubs.\r\n\r\nThe pent-up feelings of D\'Arcy and those of his way of thinking found\r\nsome relief in the demonstration which accompanied the carrying of this\r\nresolution.  It was too good a chance to be lost, and for three minutes\r\nby the clock the Classics stood on their feet and cheered their\r\nchampion, glaring defiantly as they did so at the Moderns, who having\r\nheld up their hands and cheered a little, relapsed into silence and left\r\nthe noise in the hands of the other side.\r\n\r\nThen followed the election of vice-captain, which of course had to go to\r\nClapperton.  This time the Moderns had their demonstration amid the\r\nsilence of the Classics, who thought they had never in their lives seen\r\nfellows make such asses of themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was twenty minutes past the hour, and D\'Arcy and Ashby were both\r\ngetting uncomfortable and impatient.  What did these Modern idiots want\r\nto waste the time of everybody by standing there and bellowing!  It was\r\nscandalous.\r\n\r\n"Shut up--go on to the next vote," they cried, but in vain.  The Moderns\r\nwere going to have their full share, if not a little more, of the row,\r\nand to stop them before their time was hopeless.\r\n\r\n"Disgusting exhibition, isn\'t it?" said D\'Arcy; "never mind.  Hullo, I\r\nsay, there\'s some one at the door.  It\'s those chaps!"\r\n\r\nNo, it was only Fisher minor, who, having waited meekly all this time\r\noutside the deserted gymnasium, now ventured, like a degenerate\r\nCasabianca, to desert his post and come and see what was going forward\r\nin the Hall.\r\n\r\nAs he tried to enter, a Modern boy, seeing by his ribbon that he was on\r\nthe wrong side, put his foot against the door and tried to turn him\r\nback.  But his little plot dismally failed.  For D\'Arcy and Ashby,\r\nshocked and horrified witnesses of this scandalous act of corruption,\r\ncame to the rescue with a hubbub which even made itself heard above the\r\nshouting.\r\n\r\n"Let him in!--howling cheat!--he\'s trying to shut out one of our side!\r\nYa-boo!  That\'s the way you elect your men, is it!  Come in, Fisher\r\nminor.  Let him in, do you hear?  All right; come on, you fellows, and\r\nkick this Modern chap out for a wretched sneak--(that\'ll be seven off\r\ntheir side, counting Wheatfield; and one more to us--bully!)  Yah,\r\ncheats! turn \'em out!"\r\n\r\nAmid such cries of virtuous indignation, Fisher minor was hauled in, and\r\nhis obstructor, by the same _coup de main_, excluded.  Fisher minor\r\nmight have had his head turned by this triumphal entry, had he not\r\nrecognised in the ejected Modern boy the gentleman to whom he had lent\r\nhis half-crown on the previous evening.  Any reminder of yesterday\'s\r\nmisfortunes was depressing to him, and his joy at finding himself on the\r\nright side of the door now was decidedly damped by the knowledge that\r\nhis half-crown was on the wrong.  However, there was no time for\r\nexplanations, as the shouting had ceased, and an evidently important\r\nevent was about to take place.  This was the appointment of treasurer,\r\nfor whom each of the rival sides had a candidate; that of the Classics\r\nbeing Fisher major, and that of the Moderns Brinkman of Forder\'s house,\r\na particular enemy of the other side, and reputed to be rich and no\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nBoth candidates were briefly proposed and seconded by boys of their own\r\nside, and both having declared their intention of going to the vote, a\r\nshow of hands was demanded.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of our young friends at the end of the Hall while this\r\ntedious operation was in progress may well be imagined.  The captain had\r\nsternly ordained silence during the voting; so that all they could do\r\nwas to hold up their hands to the very top of their reach, and keep a\r\nwild look-out that they were being counted, and that none of the enemy\r\nwas in any way, moral or physical, circumventing them.  As for Fisher\r\nminor, he simply trembled with excitement as he cast his eyes round and\r\ncalculated his brother\'s chances.  He could not comprehend how any one\r\ncould dare not to vote for Fisher major; and absorbed in that wonder he\r\ncontinued to hold up his hand long after the two tellers had agreed\r\ntheir figure, and the captain had ordered "hands down."\r\n\r\n"Fisher major, one hundred and twenty-seven votes; now, hands up for\r\nBrinkman."\r\n\r\n"Whew!" said D\'Arcy, fanning himself with his handkerchief; "it\'ll be a\r\nclose shave.  I say, we\'d better lean up hard against the door.  It\'ll\r\nkeep out the draughts."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve got it, I\'m afraid," said Ashby, looking round at the forest of\r\nhands; "we hadn\'t as many as that."\r\n\r\n"I say, that cad Brinkman is voting for himself," said some one.\r\n\r\n"What a shame!  My brother didn\'t.  He\'s too honourable," said Fisher\r\nminor.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!  `How now\'--you there?" cried Wally.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, amid great laughter, Fisher minor retired modestly behind the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe counting seemed interminable, and every moment, to the guilty ears\r\nof Ashby, there seemed to be a sound of footsteps without.  At last,\r\nhowever, the cry, "hands down," came once more, and you might have heard\r\na pin drop.\r\n\r\n"Fisher major, one hundred and twenty-seven votes; Brinkman, one hundred\r\nand twenty-two.  Fisher is elected."\r\n\r\nAmid the terrific Classic cheers which greeted this announcement, D\'Arcy\r\nand Ashby exchanged glances.\r\n\r\nThose five voters, waiting patiently in Wally\'s room for the clock to\r\nstrike the half-hour, would have turned the scale!\r\n\r\nAshby wished the majority had been greater or less.  But he tried to be\r\njubilant, and in response to D\'Arcy\'s thumps on the back yelled and\r\nroared till he was black in the face.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, he caught sight through the window of a small procession\r\nof five or six boys emerging from the door of Wakefield\'s house and\r\nstarting at a trot in the direction of Hall.\r\n\r\n"I say," shouted he in D\'Arcy\'s ear, "here they come!"\r\n\r\nD\'Arcy abruptly ceased shouting and descended from his form.\r\n\r\n"Come and squash up near the front," said he, hurriedly; "more room, you\r\nknow, up there."\r\n\r\n"Hoo, hoo! nearly licked that time," shouted a Modern youth near the\r\ndoor, as they moved forward.  "Served you right!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, we\'ll take it out of you, next vote," retorted D\'Arcy.\r\n"Come on, kid; squash up."  Then a happy thought struck him.  The boys\r\nimmediately near the door were mostly Moderns.  What a fine bit of\r\nelectioneering, if he could get them to shut out their own men!  So he\r\nshouted, "Look out, our side!  Mind they don\'t keep out any of our\r\nchaps.  Just the sort of dodge they\'d be up to."\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Moderns set their backs determinedly against the door and\r\nwagged their heads at one another, and were obliged to D\'Arcy for the\r\ntip.\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do for \'em," said that delighted schemer; "they won\'t let \'em\r\nin, you bet.  Look out--they\'re going to vote for secretary now."\r\n\r\nThe Classical side candidate for this important office was Ranger,\r\nalmost as great an idol in his house as the captain himself.  His Modern\r\nopponent was Dangle, a clever senior, reputed to be Clapperton\'s toady\r\nand man-of-all-work.  It was felt that if he were secretary, there would\r\nbe a strong Modern bias given to the clubs, which in the opinion of the\r\nClassic partisans would be disastrous.\r\n\r\nThe show of hands had been taken for Ranger, and every one was silent to\r\nhear the figures, when a hideous clamour arose at the door, with shouts\r\nof--\r\n\r\n"Open the door I let us in.  Cheats!  Fair play!"\r\n\r\nTo D\'Arcy\'s satisfaction, as from the safe shelter of a front place he\r\npeered down that way, the Moderns held their post at the door and\r\nrefused to let it open.  For a minute it looked as if they would\r\nsucceed; when suddenly the irate Wally appeared on the scene, followed\r\nby Fisher minor, and shouting, "Cheats! cads!  Let our fellows in!" went\r\nfor the obstructionists.\r\n\r\n"Stupid ass!" growled D\'Arcy.  "It\'s all up now.  Why couldn\'t he have\r\nlet them be?"\r\n\r\nA short and sharp _melee_ followed.  The Classics were reinforced\r\nrapidly, and the Moderns, seeing their plot detected and fearing the\r\nintervention of the seniors, sullenly raised the blockade, and allowed\r\nthe door to open.\r\n\r\nWhereat in tumbled Percy Wheatfield with five young Moderns at his\r\nheels--the very five who had been waiting for the clock to strike in\r\nWally\'s study.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by keeping us out!" demanded Percy of his brother, who\r\nchanced to be the first person he encountered.\r\n\r\n"What are you talking about?" retorted Wally, extremely chagrined to\r\ndiscover who it was he had been helping.  "We were the chaps who let you\r\nin!  It was your own cads who were keeping you out.  Ask them."\r\n\r\n"We thought you were Classics," said one of the offenders, letting the\r\ncat out of the bag.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you beauty!  Wait till I get some of you outside," bellowed the\r\noutraged Percy.\r\n\r\n"Order!  Shut up, you kids down there!" was the cry from the front.\r\n\r\n"Shut up, you kids down there!" echoed D\'Arcy and Ashby on their own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n"Ranger one hundred and twenty-three.  Hands up for Dangle; and if the\r\nyoungsters down there don\'t make less noise, I\'ll adjourn the meeting,"\r\nsaid the captain.  This awful threat secured silence while the counting\r\nproceeded.  D\'Arcy\'s face grew longer and longer, and Wally at the back\r\nbegan to breathe vengeance on the world at large.\r\n\r\n"Hands down."\r\n\r\nThe captain turned and said something to Clapperton; and Fisher major,\r\nwho overheard what was said, looked very glum.  Every one knew what was\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n"Ranger one hundred and twenty-three votes, Dangle one hundred and\r\ntwenty-four.  Dangle is--"\r\n\r\nThe shouts of the Moderns drowned the last words, and the captain had to\r\nwait a minute before he could finish what he had to say.\r\n\r\n"The votes are very close," said he.  "If any one would like, we can\r\ncount again."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" cried Ranger.  "It\'s all right.  I don\'t dispute it."\r\n\r\n"That concludes the elections," said the captain.\r\n\r\nAnd amid loud cheers and counter-cheers the meeting dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe prefects of Wakefield\'s house met that evening in Yorke\'s study to\r\ntalk over the events of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe captain was the only person present who appeared to regard the\r\nresult of the elections with equanimity.\r\n\r\n"After all," said he, "though I\'m awfully sorry about old Ranger, it\r\nseems fairer to have the officers evenly divided.  There\'s much less\r\nchance of a row than it we were three to their one."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well," said Fisher, whose pleasure in his own election\r\nhad been completely spoiled by the defeat of his friend, "if we could\r\ncount on fair play.  You know Dangle as well as I do.  I\'d sooner resign\r\nmyself than have him secretary."\r\n\r\n"What rot!" said Ranger.  "You\'d probably only give them another man.\r\nNo, we shall have to see we get fair play."\r\n\r\n"And give it, too," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"They simply packed the meeting," said Dalton, "and fetched up five\r\njuniors at the very end, who turned the scale.  If our fellows had done\r\nthe same, we should have been all right."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see the use of growling now it\'s well over," said Yorke; "the\r\ngreat thing is to see we get the best men into the teams, and that they\r\nplay up."\r\n\r\n"We hardly need go outside Wakefield\'s for that," said Fisher major;\r\n"they\'ve not a man worth his salt in a football scrimmage."\r\n\r\n"Look out that they haven\'t more than we have, that\'s all," said the\r\ncaptain, gloomily.  "I tell you what, you fellows," added he, with a\r\ntouch of temper in his voice, "if our house is to be Cock-House at\r\nFellsgarth, we can\'t afford to make fools of ourselves.  The School\'s a\r\njolly sight more important than any one house, and as long as I\'m\r\ncaptain of the School clubs I don\'t intend to inquire what house a man\r\nbelongs to so long as he can play.  We can keep all our jealousy for the\r\nHouse club if you like; but if it\'s to be carried into the School sports\r\nwe may as well dissolve the clubs and scratch all our matches at once."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if Clapperton is giving vent to the same patriotic sentiments\r\nto his admirers," said Ridgway, laughing.  "Fancy him, and Dangle, and\r\nBrinkman conspiring together for the glory of the School."\r\n\r\n"Why not!" said the captain, testily.  "Why won\'t you give anybody\r\ncredit for being decent outside Wakefield\'s?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid old Yorke hardly gives any one credit for being decent in\r\nit.  For pity\'s sake don\'t lecture any more to-night, old man," said\r\nDalton.  "I\'ll agree to anything rather than that."\r\n\r\n"There\'s just one more thing," said Yorke, "which you may take as\r\nlecture or not as you like.  Clapperton said something about helping out\r\nthe clubs with money.  Fisher major, you are the treasurer; don\'t have\r\nany of that.  Don\'t take more than the regular subscription from\r\nanybody, and don\'t take less.  If there\'s a deficit let\'s all stump up\r\nalike.  We don\'t want anybody\'s charity."\r\n\r\nThis sentiment was generally applauded, and restored the captain in the\r\ngood opinion of every one present.  After all, old Yorke\'s bark was\r\nalways worse than his bite.  He wasn\'t going to be put upon by the other\r\nside, however much he seemed to stick up for them.\r\n\r\nRanger waited a few minutes after the others had gone.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Ranger," said the captain, "you must back me up in this.\r\nYou can afford to do it, because you\'ve been beaten.  I only wish you\r\nwere in my place.  I know you hate those fellows, and are cut up to have\r\nlost the secretaryship."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to break my heart about that," said Ranger.\r\n\r\n"Of course not.  You\'re going to do what will be a lot more useful.\r\nYou\'re going to work as hard for the School as if you were secretary and\r\ncaptain in one; and you\'re going to back me up in keeping the peace,\r\naren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Would you, if you were in my shoes?" said Ranger.\r\n\r\n"I might find it hard, but I almost think I should try.  And if I had\r\nyour good temper, I should succeed too."\r\n\r\nRanger laughed.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t think you went in for flattery, Yorke.  Anyhow, I believe you\r\nare right.  I\'ll be as affectionate as I can to those Modern chaps.\r\nUgh! good night."\r\n\r\nAfter the day\'s excitement Fellsgarth went to bed early.  But no one\r\ndreamed, least of all the heroes of the exploit themselves, how much was\r\nto depend during the coming months on those five small voters who had\r\nwaited patiently in Wally Wheatfield\'s study that afternoon to hear the\r\nclock strike 5:30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nPERCY WHEATFIELD, ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY.\r\n\r\nThe misgivings of the Classics were justified.  The Moderns did not\r\naccept their victory at Elections with a meekness which augured harmony\r\nfor the coming half.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, they executed that difficult acrobatic feat known as\r\ngoing off their heads, with jubilation.\r\n\r\nFor many terms they had groaned under a sense of inferiority, partly\r\nimagined but partly well founded, in their relations with the rival\r\nside.  The Classics had given themselves airs, and, what was worse,\r\nproved their right to give them.  In its early days the Modern side was\r\nnot "in it" at Fellsgarth.  Its few members were taught to look upon\r\nthemselves as altogether a lower order of creation than the pupils of\r\nthe old foundation, and had accepted the position with due humility.\r\nThen certain rebellious spirits had arisen, who dared to ask why their\r\nside wasn\'t as good as any other?  The answer was crushing.  "What can\r\nyou do?  Only French, and book-keeping and `stinks\'"--(the strictly\r\nClassical nickname for chemistry).  "You can\'t put a man into the\r\ncricket or football field worth his salt; your houses are rowdy; your\r\nmen do nothing at the University; two out of three of you are not even\r\ngentlemen."  Whereupon the Moderns went in desperately for sports, and\r\nclaimed to be represented in the School clubs.  They maintained that\r\nthey were as good gentlemen as any who talked Latin and Greek; and to\r\nprove it they jingled their money in their trouser-pockets, and asked\r\nwhat the Classics could do in that line.  The Classics could do very\r\nlittle, and fell back on their moral advantages.  By degrees the new\r\nside grew in numbers, and made themselves heard rather more definitely.\r\nThey put into the field one or two men who could not honestly be denied\r\na place in the School teams; and they began to figure also among the\r\nSchool prefects.  The present seniors, Clapperton and his friends,\r\ncarried the thing a step further, and insisted on equal rights with\r\ntheir rivals in all the School institutions.  To their surprise they\r\nfound an ally in Yorke, who, as we have already said, hurt the feelings\r\nof many of his admirers by his Quixotic insistence on fair play all\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings yesterday had been the most recent instance of the flow\r\nin the tide of Modern progress at Fellsgarth.  Reinforced by an unusual\r\ninflux of new boys, they had aimed at, and succeeded in winning, their\r\nlevel half of the control of the School clubs; and Yorke had looked on\r\nand let them do it!\r\n\r\nNo wonder they went off their heads as they discoursed on their triumph,\r\nand no wonder they already pictured themselves masters of Fellsgarth!\r\n\r\nIt never does occur to some people that the mountain is not climbed till\r\nthe top is reached.\r\n\r\n"Really, you know," said Brinkman, "I felt half sorry for those poor\r\nbeggars; they did look so sick when Dangle was elected."\r\n\r\n"It\'s my opinion," said Clapperton, "you\'d have been in too, if all our\r\nfellows had turned up.  I saw four or five of our youngsters come in at\r\nthe last moment."\r\n\r\n"Yes--by the way," said Dangle, "that ought to be looked into.  It\'s\r\nfishy, to say the least of it, and would have made all the difference to\r\nBrinkman\'s election."\r\n\r\n"Do you know who the fellows were?" asked Clapperton.\r\n\r\n"I believe your fag was one of them."\r\n\r\n"Percy Wheatfield?  Catch him being shut out of anything.  But I\'ll ask\r\nabout it.  Fancy poor Yorke\'s feelings if we were to demand a new\r\nelection!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Dangle, "I don\'t altogether understand Yorke.\r\nHe tries to pass off as fair, and just, and all that sort of thing; but\r\none can\'t be sure he\'s not playing a game of his own."\r\n\r\n"We shall easily see that when it comes to choosing the football fifteen\r\nagainst Rendlesham.  I mean to send him in a list of fellows on our\r\nside.  It\'s only fair we should have half of them our men."\r\n\r\n"Half fifteen is seven and a half," said Fullerton, a melancholy senior\r\nwho had not yet spoken; "how will you manage about that?"\r\n\r\n"Shut up, you ass!"\r\n\r\n"I only asked," said Fullerton.  "It doesn\'t matter to me, I don\'t mind\r\ngoing as the half man, if you like.  If you send seven names you\'ll be\r\nin a minority in the fifteen, and if you send eight you\'ll be in a\r\nmajority.  It doesn\'t matter to me a bit."\r\n\r\n"Just like Fullerton.  Always asking riddles that haven\'t got an\r\nanswer," said Dangle.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how Fisher will manage the treasurership," said Brinkman, who\r\nwas evidently sore at his defeat.  "I shouldn\'t have thought accounts\r\nwere much in his line."\r\n\r\n"He can\'t have very hard work doing his own," said Clapperton, laughing,\r\n"but that\'s not his fault, poor beggar.  Only I think it would be much\r\nbetter to have a fellow for treasurer who wasn\'t in a chronic state of\r\nbeing hard up."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean," said Fullerton, who had a most awkwardly blunt way\r\nof putting things, "he\'d have less temptation to steal.  I hope Fisher\'s\r\nnot a thief."\r\n\r\n"What an idiot you are, Fullerton!" said Clapperton; "whoever said he\r\nwas?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t.  I only asked what you thought.  It doesn\'t much matter to\r\nme, except that it wouldn\'t be creditable to the School."\r\n\r\n"Of course it wouldn\'t; it\'s hardly creditable to our side to have a\r\njackass in it," said Clapperton.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right--I\'ll go.  I dare say you\'ll get on as well without me."\r\n\r\nThe others presently followed his example, and Clapperton, left to\r\nhimself, proceeded to draw up his list.\r\n\r\n"Dear Yorke," he wrote, "You will probably be making up the fifteen for\r\nthe Rendlesham match shortly.  Please put down me, Brinkman, Dangle,\r\nFullerton, West, Harrowby, and Ramshaw major, to play from our side.\r\nThis will give your side the odd man.\r\n\r\n"Yours truly,--\r\n\r\n"Geo.  Clapperton."\r\n\r\nThis important epistle accomplished, he shouted for his fag to come and\r\nconvey it to its destination.\r\n\r\nIt was not till after several calls, on an increasing scale of\r\nperemptoriness, that Master Percy condescended to appear.  When he did,\r\nhe was covered with dust from head to foot, and his face, what could be\r\nseen of it, was visibly lopsided.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come when you\'re called?  Whatever have you been up to--\r\nfighting?"\r\n\r\n"Rather not," said Percy, "only boxing.  You see, it was this way;\r\nCottle brought a pair of gloves up this term, and young Lickford had an\r\nold pair; so we three and Ramshaw have been having an eight-handed mill.\r\nIt was rather jolly; only Ramshaw and Lickford had the old gloves on,\r\nand they\'ve all the horse-hair out, so Cottle and I got it rather hot on\r\nthe face.  But we took it out of them with our body blows--above the\r\nbelt, you know--not awfully above.  I couldn\'t come when you called,\r\nbecause we were wrestling out one of the rounds.  It\'s harder work an\r\neight-handed wrestle than four hands.  Just when you called first, I\r\nnearly had Cottle and Lickford down, but you put me off my trip, and\r\nRamshaw had me over instead."\r\n\r\n"All very interesting," said Clapperton, "but you\'ll have to come sharp\r\nnext time or I shall trip you up myself.  Take this note over to Yorke.\r\nStop while he reads it, and if there\'s any answer, bring it; if not,\r\ndon\'t wait."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t Cash take it?  We\'re not nearly finished."\r\n\r\n"No.  Cut off, sharp!"\r\n\r\n"Awful shame!" growled the messenger to himself, as he departed.  "I\r\nhate Clapperton; he always waits till I\'m enjoying myself, and then\r\nrouts me out.  I shan\'t stand it much longer.  What does he want with\r\nYorke!  Perhaps it\'s a challenge.  Yes, by the way, very good chance!\r\nI\'ll see what that cad Wally\'s got to say about those kids I found in\r\nhis room yesterday.  Nice old games he gets up to; Wally\'s all very well\r\nwhen he\'s asleep, or grubbing, or doing impositions, but he\'s a sight\r\ntoo artful out of school, like all those Classic kids.  One\'s as bad as\r\nanother."\r\n\r\nAs if to emphasise this sentiment, a Classic kid at that moment came\r\nviolently into collision with Master Percy\'s waistcoat.\r\n\r\nIt was Fisher minor, who had once more caught sight in the distance of\r\nthe mysterious borrower of his half-crown, and was giving chase.\r\n\r\n"Where are you coming to, you kid.  You\'ve nearly smashed a button.\r\nI\'ll welt you for that."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Wally, I--"\r\n\r\n"Wally--what do you mean by calling me Wally?" exclaimed Percy.\r\n\r\n"Well, Wheatfield, I beg your pardon; I was in a hurry to catch a fellow\r\nup and I didn\'t see you."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you?  Well, you\'ll feel me.  Take that."\r\n\r\nFisher minor meekly accepted the cuff, and, full of his half-crown,\r\nessayed to proceed.  But Percy stopped him.\r\n\r\n"You\'re that new kid, Fisher\'s minor, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\nIt astonished Fisher minor, that the speaker, whom he supposed he had\r\nseen only ten minutes ago, should so soon have forgotten his name.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I say, Wally, I mean Wheatfield--"\r\n\r\n"Humph--I suppose you held up both hands for your precious brother\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"No, only one.  I was nearly late, though.  I waited an hour at the\r\ngymnasium, you know, and no Modern chaps came out at all."\r\n\r\nPercy began to smell rats.\r\n\r\n"Waited at the gymnasium, did you?  Who told you to do that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know--it was part of the canvassing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, _you_ were in that job, were you, my boy?  All serene, I\'ll--"\r\n\r\n"I say," cried Fisher minor, turning pale, "aren\'t you Wally Wheatfield?\r\nI thought--"\r\n\r\n"Me Wally? what do you take me for?  I\'ll let you know who I am.  You\'re\r\na beauty, you are.  Some of our chaps\'ll tell you who I am, Mr\r\nCanvasser.  Now, look here, you stop there till I come back from\r\nYorke\'s.  If you move an inch--whew! you\'ll find the weather pretty\r\nwarm, I can tell you.  Canvassing?  You\'ll get canvassed, I fancy,\r\nbefore you grow much taller."\r\n\r\nAnd off stalked the indignant Percy, promising himself a particularly\r\npleasant afternoon, as soon as his errand to the captain was over.\r\n\r\nYorke was at work, with his lexicon and notebooks on the table, when the\r\nenvoy entered.\r\n\r\n"Well, is that you or your brother?" inquired he.\r\n\r\n"Not my brother, if I know it," said Percy.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not much help.  He says exactly the same when I put the same\r\nquestion to him."\r\n\r\n"He does, does he?  I owe Wally one already, now--"\r\n\r\n"Thanks--then you\'re not Wally.  What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"This note.  Clapperton said I was to wait while you read it, and bring\r\nan answer if there was one."\r\n\r\nYorke read the note, and smiled as he did so.  Percy wished he knew what\r\nwas in it.  He didn\'t know Clapperton could make jokes.\r\n\r\n"Any answer?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Yes--there\'s an answer," said the captain.\r\n\r\nHe took out a list of names from his pocket, and compared it with that\r\non Clapperton\'s letter.  Then he wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n"Dear Clapperton,--The fifteen against Rendlesham is already made up as\r\nfollows," (here followed the list).  "You will see it includes six of\r\nthe names you sent.  We must play the best team we can; and I think we\r\nshall have it.\r\n\r\n"Yours truly,--\r\n\r\n"Cecil Yorke."\r\n\r\n"There\'s the answer.  Take it over at once."\r\n\r\n"I like his style," growled Percy to himself.  "He don\'t seem to have a\r\n`please\' about him.  Catch me hurrying myself for him; I\'ve got this\r\nprecious canvasser to look after."\r\n\r\nAnd he returned at a leisurely pace to the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nNo Fisher minor was there!\r\n\r\nThat young gentleman, when left to himself, found himself in a\r\nperspiration of doubt and fear.  He had made a most awkward blunder, and\r\nconfessed the delinquencies of his comrades to the very last man they\r\nwould wish to know of them.  That was bad enough; but, to make things\r\nworse, he was to be let in for the blame of the whole affair, and, with\r\nMaster Percy\'s assistance, was shortly to experience warm weather among\r\nthe Moderns.\r\n\r\nHappy thought!  He would not stay where he was.  He would retire, as the\r\nLatin book said, into winter quarters, and entrench himself in the\r\nstronghold of Wally and D\'Arcy and Ashby.  If he _was_ to get it hot, he\r\nwould sooner get it from them than from the barbarians in Forder\'s.\r\n\r\nWith which desperate conclusion, and once more devoutly wishing himself\r\nsafe at home, he made tracks, at a rapid walk, to Wally\'s room.  His\r\nthree comrades were all there.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up?" said they as he entered, with agitated face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, it\'s all because you and your brother are so alike.  I met\r\nhim just now; and--he\'s heard about that canvassing, you know, and I\r\nthought you\'d like to know."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say you blabbed?" said Wally, jumping to his feet.\r\n\r\n"It\'s your fault," said D\'Arcy.  "I\'ve made the same mistake myself.\r\nWhy can\'t you grow a moustache or something to distinguish you?"\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t you get your brother to be a Classic! then it wouldn\'t\r\nmatter--either of you would do," suggested Ashby.\r\n\r\nAshby was beginning to feel quite at home in Wakefield\'s.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll let some of you see if it won\'t matter," retorted Wally.  "If\r\nthey\'ve got wind of that affair the other side, there\'ll be a fearful\r\nrow.  They\'ll want another election.  Oh, you young idiot!  That comes\r\nof trusting a new kid, that sings comic songs, and parts his hair the\r\nwrong side, with a secret.  D\'Arcy\'s nearly as big an ass as you are\r\nyourself, to trust you."\r\n\r\nAfter this Philippic, Wally felt a little better, and was ready to\r\nconsider what had better be done.\r\n\r\n"He\'s bound to come here, you chaps," said he.  "You cut.  Leave him to\r\nme--I\'ll tackle him."\r\n\r\nFisher minor considered this uncommonly good advice, and obeyed it with\r\nalacrity.  The other two followed less eagerly.  They would have liked\r\nto stay and see the fun.\r\n\r\nAs Wally expected, his affectionate relative, being baulked of his prey\r\noutside, came to pay a fraternal visit.\r\n\r\n"What cheer?" said he.  "I say, have you seen a kid called Fisher minor?\r\nThe new kid, you know, that we had a lark with at dinner on first-\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that chap.  Bless you, he messes in our study.  What about him?"\r\n\r\n"I want him.  I want to say something to him."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell him."\r\n\r\n"All right.  He\'s come and told you, has he? and you\'re hiding him?\r\nNever mind; I\'ll bowl him out, the beauty.  I know all about that little\r\ngame of yours, yesterday, you know!"\r\n\r\n"What little game?"\r\n\r\n"As if you didn\'t know!  Do you suppose I didn\'t find five of \'em shut\r\nup here yesterday, being kept out of the way at Elections?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and do you suppose if it hadn\'t been for me they\'d have got into\r\nthe Hall at all?  Don\'t be a beast, Percy, if you can help.  They stayed\r\nhere of their own accord.  No one kept them in.  I say, have some\r\ntoffee?"\r\n\r\n"Got any?"\r\n\r\n"Rather.  A new brew this morning.  I say, you can have half of it."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, awfully, Wally."\r\n\r\n"You see--oh, take more than that--these new kids are such born asses,\r\nthey boss everything.  You should have heard that Fisher minor at lamb\'s\r\nsinging the other night--like the toffee?  I say, don\'t be a sneak about\r\nthose chaps.  You\'d never have got them in without me.  I backed you up,\r\nand got the door open.  I say--would you like a Turkish stamp?  I\'ve got\r\none to swop--but you can have it if you like."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, old man.  Yes, new kinds are rot.  Well, ta, ta--better make it\r\nup, I suppose.  I say, I shan\'t have time to write home to-day.  You\r\nwrite this time, and I\'ll do the two next week."\r\n\r\n"All serene, if you like.  Here, you\'re leaving one of your bits of\r\ntoffee.  Ta, ta, old chappie."\r\n\r\nAnd these great twin brethren, whose infirmity it was always to be fond\r\nof one another when they were together, and to scorn one another when\r\nthey were apart, separated in a most amicable fashion.\r\n\r\n"Well?" asked the three exiles, putting in their heads as soon as the\r\nenemy had gone.\r\n\r\n"Choked him off," said Wally, fanning himself.  "Jolly hard work.  But\r\nhe came round."\r\n\r\nPercy, meanwhile, having suddenly remembered his errand, hastened back\r\nto the house.  As he did so he observed notices of the fifteen for the\r\nRendlesham match posted on Wakefield\'s door, on the school-board, and at\r\nForder\'s.  He solaced himself by writing in bold characters the word\r\n"beast" against each of the names which belonged to a Classic boy, and\r\ndiscovered, when his task was done, that he had inscribed the word nine\r\ntimes out of fifteen on each notice.  Whereupon he made off at a run to\r\nhis senior\'s.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Clapperton, evidently anxious, "didn\'t I tell you to come\r\nback at once!  Any answer?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, this," said Percy, producing the captain\'s letter.  "I say, Yorke\r\ngrinned like anything when he read yours."\r\n\r\n"Did he?" replied Clapperton, opening the envelope.\r\n\r\nEvidently Yorke in his reply had not been guilty of a joke, for the face\r\nof the Modern captain was dark and scowling as he read it.\r\n\r\n"Cool cheek," muttered he.  "Dangle was right, after all.  You can go,\r\nyoungster."\r\n\r\n"All right.  I say, they\'ve got the fifteen stuck up on the boards--six\r\nof our chaps in it.  We ought to lick them this year."\r\n\r\nBut as Clapperton did not do him the favour of heeding his observations,\r\nhe retired, and tried vainly to collect his scattered forces to conclude\r\nthe eight-handed boxing match, which had been so unfeelingly interrupted\r\nan hour ago.\r\n\r\nClapperton, to do him justice, could not deny to himself that the team\r\nselected by the captain was the best fighting fifteen the School could\r\nput into the football field.  But, having advanced his claim for half\r\nnumbers, his pride was hurt at finding it almost contemptuously set\r\naside.  It would never do for him to climb down now.\r\n\r\nThe Moderns, after all, had a right to have their men in; and he had a\r\nright to assume they were better players than some of the selected\r\nClassics.  It was easy to work himself into a rage, and talk about\r\nfavouritism, and abuse of privilege, and all that.  His popularity in\r\nhis own house depended on his fighting their battles, and he must do it\r\nnow.  So he wrote a reply to Yorke.\r\n\r\n"Dear Yorke,--I do not agree with you about the fifteen.  I consider the\r\nmen on our side whom you have omitted are better than the three I have\r\nmarked on your list.  If we are to make the clubs a success, we ought to\r\npull together, and let there be no suspicion, however groundless, of\r\nfavouritism.\r\n\r\n"Yours truly, Geo.  Clapperton."\r\n\r\nTo this letter, which he sent over by another junior, more expeditious\r\nthan his last, he received the following reply:--\r\n\r\n"Dear Clapperton,--Sides have nothing to do with it.  If the best\r\nfifteen names were all on your side, I should have to select them.  But\r\nthey are not.  The fifteen I have chosen are undoubtedly the best men we\r\nhave, and the team most likely to win the match.  I suppose that is what\r\nwe play for.\r\n\r\n"Yours truly,--\r\n\r\n"Cecil Yorke."\r\n\r\nThis polite correspondence Clapperton laid before his friends.  The\r\ngeneral feeling was that the Moderns were being unfairly and\r\ndisrespectfully used.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the old story over again," said Dangle.  "If we don\'t look after\r\nourselves, nobody else will."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, as long as he\'s captain, I suppose he has the right to\r\npick the team," said Fullerton.  "_I_ shouldn\'t be particularly sorry if\r\nhe were to leave me out.  It wouldn\'t matter to me."\r\n\r\n"Who cares whether it matters to you?  It matters to our side," said\r\nBrinkman, "and we oughtn\'t to stand it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nROLLITT.\r\n\r\nRollitt of Wakefield\'s was a standing mystery at Fellsgarth.  Though he\r\nhad been three years at the school, and worked his way up from the\r\njunior form to one of the first six, no one knew him.  He had no\r\nfriends, and did not want any.  He rarely spoke when not obliged to do\r\nso; and when he did, he said either what was unexpected or disagreeable.\r\nHe scarcely ever played in the matches, but when he did he played\r\ntremendously.  Although a Classic, he was addicted to scientific\r\nresearch and long country walks.  His study was a spectacle for\r\nuntidiness and grime.  He abjured his privilege of having a fag.  No one\r\ndared to take liberties with him, for he had an arm like an oak branch,\r\nand a back as broad as the door.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of queer stories were afloat about him.  It was generally\r\nwhispered that his father was a common workman, and that the son was\r\nbeing kept at school by charity.  Any reference to his poverty was the\r\none way of exciting Rollitt.  But it was too risky an amusement to be\r\npopular.\r\n\r\nHis absence of mind, however, was his great enemy at school.  Of him the\r\nstory was current that once in the Fourth, when summoned to the front to\r\ncall-over the register, he called his own name among the rest, and\r\nreceiving no reply, looked to his place, and seeing the desk vacant,\r\nmarked Rollitt down as absent.  Another time, having gone to his room\r\nafter morning school to change into his flannels for cricket, he had\r\ngone to bed by mistake, and slept soundly till call-bell next morning.\r\n"Have you heard Rollitt\'s last?" came to be the common way of prefacing\r\nany unlikely story at Fellsgarth; and what with fact and fiction, the\r\nhero had come to be quite a mythical celebrity at Fellsgarth.\r\n\r\nHis thrift was another of his characteristics.  He had never been seen\r\nto spend a penny, unless it was to save twopence.  If fellows had dared,\r\nthey would have liked now and then to pay his subscriptions to the\r\nclubs; or even hand on an old pair of cricket shoes or part of the\r\ncontents of a hamper for his benefit.  But woe betide them if they ever\r\ntried it!  The only extravagance he had ever been known to commit was\r\nsome months ago, when he bought a book of trout-flies, which rumour said\r\nmust have cost him as much as an ordinary Classic\'s pocket-money for a\r\nwhole term.\r\n\r\nTo an impressionable youth like Fisher minor it was only natural that\r\nRollitt should be an object of awe.  For a day or two after his arrival,\r\nwhen the stories he had heard were fresh in his memory, the junior was\r\nwont to change his walk to a tip-toe as he passed the queer boy\'s door.\r\nIf ever he met him face to face, he started and quaked like one who has\r\nencountered a ghost or a burglar.  After a week this excess of deference\r\ntoned down.  Finding that Rollitt neither hurt nor heeded him, he\r\nabandoned his fears, and, instead of running away, stood and stared at\r\nhis man, as if by keeping his eye hard on him he could discover his\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nIt was two or three days after Elections that Fisher minor, having\r\ndiscovered by the absence of everybody from their ordinary haunts that\r\nit was a half-holiday, took it into his head to explore a little way\r\ndown the Shargle Valley.  He believed the other fellows had gone up; and\r\nhe thought it a little unfriendly that they should have left him in the\r\nlurch.\r\n\r\nHe was not particularly fond of woods, unless there were nuts in them;\r\nor of rivers, unless there were stones on the banks to shy in.  Still,\r\nit seemed to be half-holiday form at Fellsgarth to go down valleys, so\r\nhe went, quite indifferent to the beauties of Nature, and equally\r\nindifferent as to where this walk brought him.\r\n\r\nA mile below Fellsgarth, as everybody knows, the Shargle tumbles wildly\r\ninto the Shayle, with a great fuss of rapids and cataracts and "narrows"\r\nto celebrate the fact; and a mile further, the united streams flow\r\ntamely out among reeds and gravel islands into Hawkswater.\r\n\r\nFisher minor had nearly reached the junction, and was proceeding to\r\nspeculate on the possibility of picking his way among the stones towards\r\nthe lake, when he caught sight of a boat in the middle of the rapid\r\nstream.  It was tied somewhat carelessly to the overhanging branch of a\r\ntree, which bent and creaked with every lurch of the boat in the passing\r\nrapids.  Standing in the stern as unconcerned as if he was on an island\r\nin a duck-pond, was Rollitt with his fishing-rod, casting diligently\r\ninto the troubled waters.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the junior enjoyed an uninterrupted view of the\r\nobject of his curiosity.  He found it hard to recognise at first in the\r\neager, sportsmanlike figure, with his animated face, the big shambling\r\nfellow whom he had so often eyed askance in the passages at Wakefield\'s.\r\nBut there was no mistaking the shabby clothes, the powerful arms, the\r\nbroad, square back.  Rollitt the sportsman was another creature from\r\nRollitt the Classic, and Fisher minor was critic enough to see that the\r\nadvantage was with the former.\r\n\r\nThere was no chance of being detected.  Rollitt was far too busy to heed\r\nanything but the six-pounder that struggled and plunged and tore away\r\nwith his line to the end of the reel.  Had all Fellsgarth stood\r\ncongregated on the banks, he would never have noticed them.\r\n\r\nAh! he was beginning to wind in now, gingerly and artfully, and the\r\nfish, sulking desperately among the stones, was beginning to find his\r\nmaster.  It was a keen battle between those two.  Now the captive would\r\ndive behind a rock and force the line out a yard or two; now the captor\r\nwould coax it on from one hiding-place to the next, and by a cunning\r\nflank movement cut off its retreat.  Then, yielding little by little,\r\nthe fish would feign surrender, till just as it seemed within reach,\r\ntwang would go the line and the rod bend almost double beneath the\r\nsudden plunge.  Then the patient work would begin again.  The man\'s\r\ntemper was more than a match for that of the victim, and, exhausted and\r\ndespondent, the fish would, sooner or later, have to submit to the\r\ninexorable.\r\n\r\nHow long it might have gone on Fisher could never tell; for once, when\r\nvictory seemed on the point of declaring for the angler, and the shining\r\nfins of the fish floundered despairingly almost within his reach, a\r\ndownward dash nearly wrenched the rod from his hands and sent him\r\nsprawling on to the thwarts.  The sudden lurch of the boat was too much\r\nfor the ill-tied rope, and to Fisher\'s horror the noose gave way and\r\nsent boat and fisherman spinning down the rapids at five miles an hour.\r\n\r\nRollitt either did not notice the accident or was too engrossed to heed\r\nit.  He still had his fish, though as far off as before, and once more\r\nthe tedious task of coaxing him out of his tantrums was to begin over\r\nagain.  It was useless to shout.  The roar of the water among the stones\r\nabove and over the rocks below was deafening, and Fisher\'s piping voice\r\ncould never make itself heard above it.  He tried to throw a stone, but\r\nits little splash was lost in the hurly-burly of the rapids.  It was\r\nhopeless to expect that Rollitt would see him.  He had no eyes but for\r\nhis rod.\r\n\r\nThe last glimpse Fisher minor caught of him as the boat, side-on,\r\nswirled round the turn towards the falls below, he was standing on the\r\nseat, craning his neck for a glimpse of his prize, and winding in\r\ngingerly on the reel as he did so.  Then he disappeared.\r\n\r\nWith a groan of panic the small boy started to follow.  The boulders\r\nwere big and rough, and it was hard work to go at ordinary rate, still\r\nmore to run.  Happily, however, after a few steps he stumbled upon a\r\npath which, though it seemed to lead from the river, would take him, he\r\ncalculated, back to it above the falls at the end of the bend in which\r\nthe boat was.  It was a tolerable path, and Fisher minor never got over\r\nground so fast before or after.  A few seconds brought him out of the\r\nwood on to the river-bank, where the stream, deepening and hushing,\r\ngathers itself for its great leap over the falls.\r\n\r\nHad the boat already passed, and was he too late!  No; there it came,\r\nsidling along on the swift waters, the angler still at his post, leaning\r\nover with his landing-net, within reach at last of his hard-earned\r\nprize.  What could Fisher minor do!  The stream was fairly narrow, and\r\nthe boat, sweeping round the bend, was, if anything, nearer the other\r\nside, where the banks were high.  His one chance was to attract the\r\nanglers attention.  Had that angler been any one but Rollitt, it might\r\nhave been easy.\r\n\r\nArming himself with a handful of stones, Fisher minor waited till the\r\nboat came within a few yards.  Then with a great shout he flung with all\r\nhis might at the boat.\r\n\r\nThe sudden fusillade might have been unheeded, had not one stone struck\r\nthe angler\'s hand just as he was manoeuvring his landing-net under the\r\nfish.  In the sudden start he missed his aim and looked up.\r\n\r\n"Look out!" screamed Fisher.  "You\'re adrift!  Catch the branch!"\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed wildly to the branch of an ash which straggled out over\r\nthe water just above the fall.\r\n\r\nRollitt took in the situation at last.  He cast a regretful glance at\r\nthe fish as it gave its last victorious leap and vanished.  Then,\r\nstanding on the gunwale and measuring his distance from the tree, he\r\njumped.  For a moment Fisher minor thought he had missed; for the branch\r\nyielded and went under with his weight.  But in a moment, just as the\r\nboat with a swoop plunged over the fall, he rose, clutching securely and\r\nhauling himself inch by inch out of the torrent.  To Fisher, who watched\r\nbreathlessly, it seemed as if every moment the branch would snap and\r\nsend the senior back to his fate.  But it held out bravely and supported\r\nhim as he gradually drew himself up and finally perched high and dry\r\nabove the water.\r\n\r\nFisher minor\'s difficulties now began.  Having seen his man safe he\r\nwould have liked to run away; for he was not at all sure how Rollitt\r\nwould take it.  Besides, he wouldn\'t much care to be seen by fellows\r\nlike Wally or D\'Arcy walking back in his company to Fellsgarth.  On the\r\nother hand, it seemed rather low to desert a fellow just when he was\r\nhalf-drowned and might be hurt.  What had he better do?  Rollitt decided\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nHe came along the bough to where the boy stood, and dropped to the\r\nground in front of him.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," he said, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\nFisher was horribly alarmed.  The tone in which the word was spoken was\r\nvery like that which Giant Blunderbore may have used when dinner was\r\nannounced.  However, he summoned up courage to hold out his hand, and\r\nwas surprised to find how gently Rollitt grasped it.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to hurt you with the stones," he said.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t.  Come and look for the boat, Fisher minor."\r\n\r\n"He knows my name then," soliloquised the minor, beginning to recover a\r\nlittle from his panic.  "I hope nobody will see me."\r\n\r\nThe boat was found bottom upwards--a wreck, with its side stove in,\r\nentangled in a mass of flotsam and jetsam which had gathered in one of\r\nthe side eddies below the waterfall.\r\n\r\n"Haul in, Fisher minor," growled Rollitt, surveying the wreck.\r\n\r\nWith difficulty they got it ashore and turned it right side up.\r\n\r\n"Rod, flies, net, all gone," said Rollitt, half angry; "and fish too."\r\n\r\n"It was such a beauty, the trout you hooked.  I wish you\'d got it.  You\r\nnearly had it too when you had to jump out," ventured Fisher.\r\n\r\nRollitt looked down almost amiably at the speaker.  Had the boy studied\r\nfor weeks he could not have made a more conciliatory speech.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t be helped," said the senior.  "Might have been worse.  Thanks\r\nagain.  Come and see Mrs Wisdom."\r\n\r\nMrs Wisdom was a decent young widow woman in whom the Fellsgarth boys\r\nfelt a considerable interest.  Her husband, late gamekeeper at Shargle\r\nLodge, had always had a civil word for the young gentlemen, especially\r\nthose addicted to sport, by whom he had been looked up to as a universal\r\nauthority and ally.  In addition to his duties at the Lodge, which were\r\nvery ill paid, he had eked out his slender income by the help of a boat,\r\nwhich he kept on the lower reach below the falls, and which was, in the\r\nseason, considerably patronised by the schoolboys.  When last season he\r\nmet his death over one of the cliffs of Hawk\'s Pike, every one felt\r\nsympathy for the widow and her children, who were thus left homeless and\r\ndestitute.  An effort was made, chiefly by the School authorities, to\r\nget her some laundry work, and find her a home in one of the little\r\ncottages on the School farm, near the river; while the boys made it\r\nalmost a point of honour never to hire another boat down at the lake if\r\nMrs Wisdom\'s was to be had.\r\n\r\nLast week the boat had been brought up to the cottage on a cart, to be\r\nrepainted for the coming season, and while here Rollitt had begged the\r\nuse of it for this particular afternoon to fish from in the upper reach.\r\n\r\n"Take care of her, Master Rollitt," said the widow; "she\'s a\'most all\r\nI\'ve got left, except the children.  My John, he did say the upper reach\r\nwas no water for boats."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take care," said Rollitt.\r\n\r\nAs the two boys now walked slowly, towards the cottage, Fisher minor\r\ncould see that his companion\'s face was working ominously.  He mistook\r\nit for ill-temper at the time, for he did not know Mrs Wisdom\'s\r\nhistory, or what the wreck meant to her.\r\n\r\nShe was at her door as they approached, and as she looked up and saw\r\ntheir long faces, the poor woman jumped at the truth at once.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say there\'s anything wrong with the boat, Master Rollitt.  Don\'t\r\ntell me that."\r\n\r\nRollitt nodded, almost sternly.\r\n\r\n"It went over the fall," said Fisher, feeling that something ought to be\r\nsaid.  "Rollitt only just got out in time."\r\n\r\n"Over the fall!  Then it\'s smashed," cried she, bursting into tears.\r\n"It was to keep our body and soul together this season.  Now what\'ll\r\nbecome of us!  Oh, Master Rollitt, I did think you\'d take care of my\r\nboat.  It was all I had left--bar the children.  What\'ll _they_ do now?"\r\n\r\nRollitt stood by grimly silent till she had had her cry and looked up.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," said he, in a voice that meant what it said.  "What was it\r\nworth?"\r\n\r\n"Worth?  Everything to me."\r\n\r\n"What would a new one cost?"\r\n\r\n"More than I could pay, or you either.  My John gave five pound for\r\nher--and oh, how we scrimped to save it!  Where\'s it to come from now!"\r\nand she relapsed again into tears.\r\n\r\nRollitt waited a little longer, but there was nothing more to add; and\r\npresently he signalled Fisher to come away.\r\n\r\nHe was silent all the way home.  The junior did not dare to speak to\r\nhim--scarcely to look up in his face.  Yet it did occur to him that if\r\nany one had a right to be in a bad temper over that afternoon\'s\r\nproceedings it was Mrs Wisdom, and not Rollitt.\r\n\r\nAs they neared the school, Fisher minor began to feel dreadfully\r\ncompromised by his company.  Rollitt\'s clothes were wet and muddy; his\r\nhands and face were dirty with his scramble along the tree; his air was\r\nmorose and savage, and his stride was such that the junior had to trot a\r\nstep or two every few yards to keep up.  What would fellows think of\r\nhim!  Suppose Ranger were to see him, or, still worse, the Modern\r\nWheatfield, or--\r\n\r\nAt this moment fate solved his problem.  For just ahead of him, turning\r\nthe corner of Fowler\'s Wall, was the cadaverous individual who owed him\r\nhalf a crown.\r\n\r\n"Oh, excuse me, Rollitt," said he, "there\'s a fellow there I want to\r\nspeak to.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\nRollitt did not appear either to hear the words or notice the desertion,\r\nbut stalked on till he reached Wakefields\'.  The house seemed to be\r\nempty.  Evidently none of the other half-holiday makers had returned.\r\nStudy doors stood open; an unearthly silence reigned in Wally\'s\r\nquarters.  Even the tuck-shop was deserted.\r\n\r\nThe only person he met was Dangle, the clubs\' secretary, who had\r\npenetrated into the enemy\'s quarter in order to confer with his dear\r\ncolleague the treasurer as to calling a committee meeting, and was now\r\nreturning unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Rollitt," said he, "tell Fisher major, will you, I want to see him\r\nas soon as he comes in.  I\'d leave a line for him, but I don\'t know his\r\nroom."\r\n\r\nWhether Rollitt heard or not, he had to guess.  At any rate he hardly\r\nfelt sanguine that his message would be delivered.\r\n\r\nAs for Rollitt, he shut himself into his study with a bang, and might\r\nhave been heard by any one who took the trouble to listen, pacing up and\r\ndown the floor for a long time that evening.  He did not put in an\r\nappearance in the common room, and although Yorke sent to ask him to\r\ntea, he forgot all about the invitation, and even if he had remembered\r\nit, would have forgotten whether he had said Yes or No.\r\n\r\nThe next morning--Sunday--just as the chapel bell was beginning to ring,\r\nWidow Wisdom was startled by a loud knock at her door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Master Rollitt," said she, and her eyes were red still, "is the\r\nboat safe after all?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I\'ve got you another.  Farmer Gay\'s was for sale on the lake--\r\nI\'ve bought it.  It\'s yours now."\r\n\r\n"Farmer Gay\'s--mine?  Oh, go on, Master Rollitt, how could _you_ buy a\r\nboat any more than me?  You\'ve no money to spare, I know."\r\n\r\n"It\'s yours--here\'s the receipt," said the boy, with almost a scowl.\r\n\r\n"But, Master Rollitt--"\r\n\r\nBut Master Rollitt had gone to be in time for chapel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTRIAL BY JURY.\r\n\r\nFisher minor\'s hopes rose high within him as he stalked his debtor\r\nacross the School Green.  Three times already he had encountered him,\r\nbut fate had stepped in to prevent the collection of his dues.  Now--\r\n\r\nHe had arrived at this stage when a voice at his side sent a cold shiver\r\ndown his back.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, kid, got you at last, then?  That\'s what you call waiting where\r\nI left you, do you?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t promise to wait," said Fisher.  "You told me to."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the same thing.  Now you\'ll come along with me, my beauty."\r\n\r\nHad Fisher minor been anything but a raw hand, it might have occurred to\r\nhim that it would take Percy Wheatfield all his time to convey a boy\r\nhis, Fisher\'s, size against his will into Forder\'s house.  But such is\r\nthe force of innocence on one side, and authority on the other, that the\r\nnew boy laid down his arms, and followed his captor meekly into the\r\nenemy\'s citadel.  Just as they were entering, a posse of the enemy\r\nappeared on the scene, consisting, among other supporters of the Modern\r\ncause, of Ramshaw, Cottle, Lickford, and Cash.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a game, Rammy," cried Percy.  "Got him at last!  This is the\r\nvillain, this is the murdering, highway forger.  Come on, you kid;\r\nyou\'re in for it."\r\n\r\nIt did occur to Fisher minor at this juncture that a change of air might\r\nbe refreshing.  But it was too late now.  The enemy had him fast.  There\r\nwas no getting out of the "warm weather" which had been promised him.\r\n\r\n"Come on--we\'ll have a regular Old Bailey of it," cried Percy.  "Go and\r\ntell the fellows, and collar some witnesses, do you hear; and tell the\r\nhangman he\'ll be wanted in half an hour."\r\n\r\nThis promise of judicial dispatch was not consoling to the prisoner, who\r\nhad grave doubts as to the impartiality of the tribunal before which he\r\nwas to be arraigned.  He wondered if Ashby, or D\'Arcy, or any of his\r\nfriends would appear among the witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe trial took place in the room jointly owned by Percy, Ramshaw,\r\nCottle, and Lickford.  A chair was planted on the bed for the\r\naccommodation of the judge.  The fender was brought out in front of the\r\nchest of drawers for a witness-box; while Rix minimus, who officiated as\r\njury, sat on a footstool on the table.\r\n\r\nAs for the prisoner, a dock was provided for him in the form of a wash-\r\nstand, out of which the basin had been removed to make room for his\r\nuneasy person in the vacant hole.\r\n\r\n"Now, you chaps," said Percy, who had naturally appointed himself, in\r\naddition to his other offices, "usher of the court", "no larks.  Shut\r\nup.  This is a big job.  This young cad cheated at Elections."\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and Dangle looked in.\r\n\r\n"What on earth is all this row?" he said.\r\n\r\n"A trial.  I say, Dangle, will you be judge?  It\'s a Classic kid that\r\ncheated at Elections."\r\n\r\n"No, really, I didn\'t," said Fisher, painfully aware that so far, the\r\ntrial was going against him.\r\n\r\nDangle, who fancied something might come of this, was condescending\r\nenough to say he didn\'t mind playing at judge, if they liked.  Whereat,\r\namid cheers, he was voted to the chair on the bed, where he sat rather\r\nprecariously, and ordered silence in the court.\r\n\r\n"Who is the prisoner?"\r\n\r\n"Go on, kid, tell \'em your name," said Percy, encouragingly.\r\n\r\n"Fisher minor--really I didn\'t do anything," said the prisoner.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the charge?" said the judge.\r\n\r\n"You see, it\'s this way," said Percy, forgetting to go inside the\r\nfender--"Bam, and Cot, and Lick and I were having a ripping eight-handed\r\nmill in here the other day--"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner thought over all his crimes, and could recall nothing that\r\nwas even remotely connected with an eight-handed mill.\r\n\r\n"Cot and Lick had got gloves with no horse-hair in them, you know, so\r\nthey lammed it pretty hard; but Ram and I were just scrunching them\r\nup--"\r\n\r\n"Crams!  You never got near us.  My nose wasn\'t hit once," said Cottle.\r\n\r\n"No; but we had you in the ribs."\r\n\r\n"Under the belt," ejaculated Lickford.\r\n\r\n"No, it wasn\'t--I say, Dangle," said the witness, "it was just on his\r\nwaistcoat pocket, and he says that\'s below the belt.  If he likes to\r\nwear his belt round his neck, of course he gets hit under."\r\n\r\n"And if you wear yours round your ankle, there\'s not much room for your\r\nbread-basket," retorted Cottle.\r\n\r\n"And where does Fisher minor come in?" asked the judge; "was he in the\r\nmiddle of the mill?"\r\n\r\n"No.  You see, we were just in the middle of it, and these jolly cheats\r\nwere beginning to cave in--"\r\n\r\n"Ho, ho!--It would take a lot more than you to make us--"\r\n\r\n"Order in the court--go on, Wheatfield."\r\n\r\n"There you are--shut up, you chaps--beginning to cave in, when\r\nClapperton yelled for me, and I had to go."\r\n\r\n"Lucky job for you," growled Cottle.  "You wouldn\'t have been able to go\r\nat all five minutes later."\r\n\r\nWhereupon Percy appealed to the court to keep order.\r\n\r\n"Fire away," said the judge, "that\'s nothing to do with the prisoner."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hasn\'t it!--You see, Clapperton wanted me to take a letter to\r\nYorke.  It must have been a screamer, for Yorke yelled when he read it.\r\nI wanted him to let me finish our mill first, but--"\r\n\r\n"Who, Yorke?"\r\n\r\n"No, Clapperton.  If there\'d been time for another round--"\r\n\r\n"Now, then, don\'t let\'s have any more of that mill," said the judge.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what they felt at the time, wasn\'t it, Lick?" ejaculated\r\nCottle.\r\n\r\n"Did we?--wait till you see, my beauty," said the witness.  "I wish you\r\nwouldn\'t interrupt.  Oh, so I had to go, and this kid came and caught me\r\na jolly crack in the stomach."\r\n\r\n"Which side of your belt?" inquired Lickford.\r\n\r\n"The side you\'ll get it hot, my boy, next time I catch you," retorted\r\nPercy.\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be under, you bet," said Lickford.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to hurt you," said the prisoner, who began to hope that\r\nthe charge against him was to prove much less serious than he had at\r\nfirst feared, "I apologise."\r\n\r\n"Shut up, don\'t talk to me--talk to the jury."\r\n\r\nAs the jury at this moment was struggling manfully to protect his\r\nhassock from the depredations of Cash, who was anxious to investigate\r\nits interior, it was not much use addressing him; so Fisher subsided,\r\nand wished the hole of Percy\'s wash-stand had been at least so much\r\neasier in diameter as to allow him room to sigh.\r\n\r\n"Fire away," said the judge, "we shall be all night at this."\r\n\r\n"Well, you see," continued Percy, "it\'s this way.  I\'ve got a brother,\r\nyou know, called Wally, a seedy Classic chap, and up to no end of low\r\ntricks."\r\n\r\n"We know him," echoed the court generally.\r\n\r\n"Not got such a rummy-shaped waist as his brother, though," whispered\r\nCottle.\r\n\r\n"All right, young Cottle, I\'ll take it out of you, you\'ll see."\r\n\r\n"What\'ll you take!  I keep mine outside," replied Cottle.\r\n\r\n"Order in the court.  Forge away, Wheatfield."\r\n\r\n"I should like to know how I\'m to forge away, with these two asses\r\nfooling about down here?  Why can\'t you raise them to the bench to keep\r\nthem quiet?  Oh yes--well, you see, this kid, being new, and green, and\r\nabout as high old an idiot as they make them--did you fellows see him on\r\nfirst-night?  I say! oh my--"\r\n\r\n"Look here, Wheatfield," said the judge, sternly, "if you aren\'t done in\r\nthree minutes, I\'ll call the next witness."\r\n\r\n"_He_ wouldn\'t know anything about it, bless you," said Percy.  "You\r\nsee, it was like this--this kid thought I was Wally--what do you think\r\nof that?"\r\n\r\n"Cheek.  Jolly rough on Wally," remarked Cash.  The witness looked at\r\nthe interrupter, and tried to make out whether his remark was a\r\ncompliment or the reverse.  He decided that, as he had only three\r\nminutes left, he had better defer thinking the question out till\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n"So, of course, he began to swagger about his big brother--"\r\n\r\n"No, you asked me--" began the prisoner.\r\n\r\n"Shut up," cried Percy, sternly, "how am I to get done in three minutes\r\nif--"\r\n\r\n"Only two left now," said Ramshaw.\r\n\r\n"Go on, Ram, I\'ve not been a minute yet."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you have--sixty-five seconds," said Ramshaw, who held his watch in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n"I never did believe in those Waterbury turnips, they always stop when\r\nyou--oh yes!--swaggered about his big brother and all those fellows over\r\nthere, and blabbed out there\'d been a regular plant among \'em to rig the\r\nElections, and he and a lot of \'em had been out canvassing and bagged a\r\nlot of our kids and locked them out, and if it hadn\'t been for that,\r\nBrinkman would have pulled off the treasurership, and if it hadn\'t been\r\nfor me getting wind of it, and going and fetching them out and bringing\r\nthem into Hall in the nick of time, Ranger would have got the\r\nsecretaryship, and our side would have been jolly well out of it, and I\r\nmean to say it\'s a howling swindle--and--hope--there\'ll--be--a--jolly--\r\ngood--row kicked--up--and--you--needn\'t--say--I--let--out--about it--\r\nbecause--Wally--asked--me--to--keep--it--mum--and I--said--"\r\n\r\n"Time\'s up," said Ramshaw.  "No side?"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the witness stopped short triumphantly, like an athlete who\r\nhas just won his race by a neck.\r\n\r\n"Come," said the judge, "this is getting interesting.  Who\'s the next\r\nwitness?  Are any of our fellows who were collared here?"\r\n\r\n"Rather--young Rix is one."\r\n\r\n"Please, Dangle," said the prisoner, "I didn\'t touch anybody.  I was--\r\nthat is--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell crams," said Percy, "it\'s a bad habit."\r\n\r\n"Rix had better go into the witness-box," said the judge.\r\n\r\n"What about the jury?" asked that functionary.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'d keep the place warm," volunteered Percy.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Rix quitted his hassock, and entered the fender.\r\n\r\n"I and Slingsby got nailed by a Classic cad outside our form door.  I\r\nkicked him on the shins, though," said he.\r\n\r\n"What Classic cad!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know; a new kid with sandy hair, a horrid lout.  It was\r\nWally\'s room we were taken to, and they fooled us about high tea and\r\nthat sort of thing.  The place was swarming with our chaps who had been\r\ncollared."\r\n\r\n"How many?" asked the judge.  "Fifty?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite so many; there were four or five."\r\n\r\n"Next witness."\r\n\r\nAnother of the captives gave similar evidence.  After which, Lickford\r\ndeposed that he had seen the troop come in to Elections just in time to\r\nvote for Dangle.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and who tried to keep us out, I\'d like to know?" said Percy.\r\n"There you are, it was _you_!"\r\n\r\n"I thought you were on the other side."\r\n\r\n"Did you?  I\'m very glad Wally gave you a welting for it.  I wish he\'d\r\ndo it again."\r\n\r\n"He hits above the belt, that\'s how I know him from you," retorted\r\nLickford.\r\n\r\n"Order--what\'s the prisoner got to say!"\r\n\r\n"Crams," said Percy, "it\'s no use asking him."\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit," said the judge.  "Fisher minor, how many of our chaps did\r\nyou collar?"\r\n\r\n"None, really," said the prisoner.  "I waited by the gymnasium."\r\n\r\n"Oh.  What for?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I was canvassing."\r\n\r\n"What did you wait at the gymnasium for?"  This was awkward.  Fisher\r\nminor found himself getting into a tight corner, tighter even than the\r\nwash-stand.  "I was told to."\r\n\r\n"Who by? your brother, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Oh no.  My brother wouldn\'t do such a thing."\r\n\r\n"What sort of thing?"\r\n\r\n"Why, try to collar fellows off the other side."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that was your little game, was it?  Whose idea was it?  Yorke\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no.  It was D\'Arcy spoke to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, D\'Arcy.  And who spoke to him?  Whose fag is he?"\r\n\r\n"Ridgway\'s."\r\n\r\n"And what did Ridgway tell him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Ridgway told him anything.  The only one I heard speak to\r\nhim was Wally."\r\n\r\n"Wretched young sneak!" said Percy.  "I\'ll let Wally know that."\r\n\r\n"Wally, he\'s Yorke\'s fag.  Who else was there?"\r\n\r\n"Only me and Ashby."\r\n\r\n"Who does Ashby fag for?"\r\n\r\n"My brother, Fisher major."\r\n\r\n"I thought you said just now your brother wasn\'t in it.  You\'d better be\r\ncareful, youngster."\r\n\r\nFor the life of him, Fisher minor, in his bewildered state, could not\r\nmake out how Ridgway, and Yorke, and Fisher major all seemed to have got\r\nmixed up in the affair.\r\n\r\n"You mean to say," said the judge, "you don\'t know what the orders to\r\nthe fags were?"\r\n\r\n"No, really--I only heard of it from D\'Arcy."\r\n\r\n"Your brother never said anything to you direct!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no."\r\n\r\n"Has he said anything since?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; that is, he only said it was a pity Ranger got beaten."\r\n\r\n"Did he say how it happened?"\r\n\r\n"He said if the five Modern chaps hadn\'t turned up at the last moment,\r\nhe\'d have won."\r\n\r\n"Was he angry about it?"\r\n\r\n"He was rather in a wax."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you you were an ass?"\r\n\r\n"Not that time."\r\n\r\n"Another time?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, once or twice."\r\n\r\n"\'Cute chap, your brother," said Percy, aside.\r\n\r\n"Shut up, Wheatfield.  Now tell me this, young Fisher major," said\r\nDangle, with an air of importance which intimidated the prisoner; "what\r\nwas it your brother said about the election?"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t to me, it was to Ranger, my senior.  He said it was a regular\r\nsell, and he\'d have given a lot to see you beaten, because he knew you\r\ncouldn\'t play fair at anything, even if you tried."\r\n\r\nSome of the court were rude enough to laugh at this very candid\r\nconfession; but the judge himself failed to see any humour in it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s what he said?  And yet you mean to tell me, after that, that\r\nyour brother had nothing to do with trying to get Ranger elected instead\r\nof me?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he had; but I\'m sure he didn\'t mean to do anything fishy, any\r\nmore than I did.  I thought it was only a joke."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve a nice notion of a joke.  That\'ll do, you can cut."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Percy, aghast, "aren\'t you going to hang him?"\r\n\r\n"No, I must go.  You can finish the trial yourselves."\r\n\r\nAs soon as the judge had quitted the bench, Percy mounted it, and\r\nproceeded to sum up.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a nice article, you are," said he, addressing the\r\nprisoner--"what do you mean by sneaking on my young brother, Wally, eh?\r\nYou\'ll get it hot for that, I can tell you.  You\'re to be hanged, drawn,\r\nand quartered; then you\'re to be kicked all round our side; then you\'re\r\nto be ducked in the river; then you\'re to kneel down and lick every\r\nchap\'s boots; then you\'re to be executed; then you\'re to be burnt alive;\r\nthen you\'re to write out fifty Greek verbs; then you\'re-- Hallo, who\'s\r\nthere?  Come in! what do you want?"\r\n\r\nThis abrupt curtailment of the prisoner\'s doom was occasioned by a\r\nmodest tap at the door; probably some belated witness come to add his\r\nevidence to the rest, "Come in, can\'t you?" repeated Percy.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the door opened with a swing, and in rushed Wally, D\'Arcy,\r\nAshby, and three or four other Classic fags.  How they had got wind of\r\nthe capture of their man it would be hard to say; but now they had come\r\nto fetch him.\r\n\r\nThe only thing visible in Percy\'s room for several minutes was dust--out\r\nof which proceeded yells, and howls, and recriminations which would have\r\ndone credit to Pandemonium.  As the cloud rolled by, the Classics might\r\nbe seen in a firm phalanx, with their man in the middle, backing on to\r\nthe door.  Signs of carnage lay all around.  Lickford was struggling,\r\nhead downward, in the wash-stand.  Cash was leaning up in a corner, with\r\nhis hand modestly placed over his nose.  Ramshaw and Cottle were engaged\r\nin deadly strife on the floor, each under the fond delusion that the\r\nother was a Classic; while the twin brothers, armed with the better pair\r\nof boxing-gloves, were having a friendly spar in the middle.\r\n\r\nIt was a victory all along the line for the invaders, and when, a moment\r\nafterwards, they stampeded in a body, and marched with shouts of victory\r\ndown the passage, carrying the late prisoner among them, there was no\r\nmistake about the ignominious defeat of the besieged garrison.\r\n\r\nThat evening Fisher major received a polite note from his colleague, the\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\n"Dear Fisher,--It is only right to tell you, that we have discovered\r\nthat five of our fellows were prevented from voting at Elections by boys\r\nof your side, apparently acting under orders from their seniors.  We\r\ndon\'t profess to know who were at the bottom of it, but it is a fact\r\nthat the election for treasurer would have gone differently but for this\r\nvery shady trick.  Clapperton and most of us are not disposed to claim a\r\nnew election, now everything is settled, and you have already got in\r\nmost of the subscriptions.  But it makes us think that even the virtuous\r\nClassics at Fellsgarth are not absolutely perfect even yet--which is a\r\npity.\r\n\r\n"Yours truly,--\r\n\r\n"R.  Dangle."\r\n\r\nThis pleasant letter, Fisher major, raging, carried to the captain.\r\n\r\nYorke pulled a long face when he read it.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no truth in it, surely?" said he.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t answer for any foolery the juniors have been up to; but apart\r\nfrom that, it\'s a sheer lie, and the fellows deserve to be kicked."\r\n\r\n"Much better offer them a new election," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"What!  They\'ll get their man in."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, suppose they do.  You\'ll still belong to Fellsgarth.\r\nThey mustn\'t have a chance of saying they don\'t get fair play."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps you\'re right.  I don\'t care twopence about the\r\ntreasurership, but I wouldn\'t like to be beaten by Brinkman."\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t be, old man," said the captain.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when fellows got up, they found the following notice on\r\nthe boards:\r\n\r\n"Elections.\r\n\r\n"A protest having been handed in against the recent election for\r\ntreasurer, notice is given that a fresh election will be held for this\r\noffice on Friday next at 3.\r\n\r\n"C.Y., Captain."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nONE TOO MANY.\r\n\r\nThe seniors of Forder\'s house were by no means gratified at the\r\ncaptain\'s prompt reply to Dangle\'s accusation.  Indeed, that active and\r\nenergetic official had written to Fisher on his own responsibility, and\r\nwas now a little hurt to find that his colleagues were half inclined to\r\nrepudiate his action.\r\n\r\n"Why ever couldn\'t you speak about the thing before you wrote like\r\nthat?" said Clapperton.  "We don\'t want another election."\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t going to sit down meekly, and let those fellows cheat\r\nwithout saying a word, were you?" retorted Dangle.\r\n\r\n"No--rather not.  But that wasn\'t the way to do it.  It would have paid\r\nus much better to stand on our dignity."\r\n\r\n"In other words," said Fullerton in his melancholy voice, "to have a\r\ngrievance, and nurse it well."\r\n\r\n"You idiot!" said Clapperton.  "I don\'t want you to tell me what I\r\nmean."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t, I was telling the others," said Fullerton.  "But I agree with\r\nyou.  If we have another election and get beaten, we shall be far worse\r\noff than if we were able to take heaven and earth to witness we had been\r\nwronged and were too noble to seek revenge."\r\n\r\nIf Fullerton could have translated Cicero as well as he translated\r\nClapperton, what a good Classic he would have been!\r\n\r\n"We\'d better decline the new election at once," said Brinkman; "it\r\nconcerns me more than anybody else; and I agree with Clapperton."\r\n\r\n"Why ever not have the new election?" said Dangle.  "We\'re bound to get\r\nour man in."\r\n\r\n"Better decline it first," said Clapperton.  "They\'ll be glad enough not\r\nto let it go to a trial, I expect."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah for injured innocence," said Fullerton; "it\'s the best paying\r\nthing I know."\r\n\r\nThe result of this conference was, that Dangle went across after school\r\nnext morning to the captain\'s study where Fisher and Ranger happened to\r\nbe calling at the same time.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Yorke," said the secretary, adopting his most civil tones,\r\n"you quite misunderstood my letter to Fisher major.  We don\'t want\r\nanother election.  We\'d just as soon let things stop as they are.  It\r\nwas rough on us, of course; but it divides the offices up more fairly to\r\nhave them as they are."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Yorke, "that\'s not good enough.  We\'ll have another\r\nelection on Friday."\r\n\r\nDangle\'s face fell.\r\n\r\n"You\'re fools if you do," said he.  "Those five votes will make all the\r\ndifference."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if they\'ve five hundred," said Yorke.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right.  You\'ve no message about the cheats who kept our men\r\nout, have you?  Probably they\'ve been promoted to prefects!"\r\n\r\n"You took care not to commit yourself to any names; but, as you wrote to\r\nFisher major, you probably include him as one of the cheats.  If so, I\r\ndare say he\'ll be glad to discuss the matter with you outside."\r\n\r\n"I never said it was he," said Dangle hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"But I know who it was."\r\n\r\n"Three of our juniors, I understand?" said Yorke.  "The fags of three of\r\nyour prefects, yes."\r\n\r\n"Fisher," said the captain, "will you fetch Ashby, D\'Arcy, and Fisher\r\nminor here?"\r\n\r\nThe young gentlemen in question were not far away busily engaged in\r\ntheir joint study, with Wally\'s assistance, in getting up a stock of\r\nimpositions, which should serve as a common fund on which to draw daring\r\nthe term.\r\n\r\nThe idea was D\'Arcy\'s.\r\n\r\n"You see," he had said, "we\'re bound to catch it, some of as, and it\'s a\r\njolly fag having to do the lines just when they\'re wanted.  My notion\r\nis, if we just keep a little stock by us, it\'ll be awfully handy.  Why,\r\nsuppose young Ashby were to get fifty lines at morning school next\r\nSaturday, what about his chance of getting into the 58th fifteen?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s the 6th fifteen, not the 58th," said Ashby.\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s not much difference."\r\n\r\n"It would be jolly awkward," said Ashby.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and you always do get potted just when it is jolliest awkward,"\r\nsaid D\'Arcy.  "That\'s why it\'s such a tip to have your impots written\r\nbefore you get them.  Penny wise, pound foolish, you know."\r\n\r\nIt was not at all clear what this valuable aphorism had to do with the\r\nsubject in hand, but it impressed the two new boys considerably.\r\n\r\n"And just fancy," continued Wally, driving home his chum\'s nails with\r\nconsiderable industry, "just fancy if young Fisher was to have to sit up\r\nhere swotting over lines, just when his brother wants his vote in Hall\r\non Friday!  Why, one vote will make all the difference."\r\n\r\nFisher immediately called for pens, ink, and paper, which Wally and\r\nD\'Arcy promptly supplied for him and Ashby, and a scene of unparalleled\r\nindustry ensued.  Even D\'Arcy insisted on doing his share, which\r\nconsisted of drawing niggers in various stages of public execution,\r\nlabelled with the names of Clapperton, Dangle, and Brinkman, while Wally\r\ngenerally superintended and assisted, by playing fives against the wall.\r\n\r\n"I say," said he presently, "I suppose it\'s all out about your precious\r\ncanvassing.  That beast Percy has gone and blabbed--after me giving him\r\ntoffee too!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said D\'Arcy, "we rather took it out of them, I fancy,\r\nyesterday.  They won\'t mess about with us in a hurry again."\r\n\r\n"No, we did pull that off pretty well.  I\'m sorry for our seniors, you\r\nknow.  We did our best for them, and we shan\'t be able to give them the\r\nsame leg-up on Friday."\r\n\r\n"They ought to be pretty civil to us this term, anyhow," said Wally.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Fisher major entered the room.\r\n\r\n"Yorke wants D\'Arcy, Ashby, and my minor.  Come at once, he\'s waiting."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t he want me?" said Wally, evidently afraid lest his services were\r\ngoing to be overlooked.  "I was in it too, you know, Fisher."\r\n\r\n"Were you?  Oh, you\'d better come too, then."\r\n\r\n"Thanks."\r\n\r\nAnd the four, disposing themselves meekly for their coming honours,\r\nfollowed, single file, into the captain\'s room.\r\n\r\n"Wally wished to come too," explained Fisher.  "He says he was in it."\r\n\r\nIt perplexed the four heroes to see Dangle there.  What did he want!\r\nAnd why did the captain look so stern?  And, oh, horrors, what was that\r\nswitch on the table for?\r\n\r\nGradually it dawned upon them that the honours in store for them would\r\nfall rather thicker than they were prepared for; and Wally, for one,\r\nwished he had stayed at home.\r\n\r\n"You youngsters," said the captain, "it is said that you four behaved\r\nunfairly last election, by keeping out five boys from voting.  Is that\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ashby.\r\n\r\n"They were only Modern kids," explained D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"They wouldn\'t have got in for the second vote, if it hadn\'t been for\r\nme," remarked Wally.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t catch any boys; I couldn\'t find any," said Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"You see, Yorke," said D\'Arcy, who began to realise that he was "boss of\r\nthis show," "these two kids are new kids; they oughtn\'t to be licked;\r\nit\'s Wally and me."\r\n\r\n"Me?" exclaimed the injured Wally; "I like your style, young D\'Arcy;\r\nwhat did _I_ do?"\r\n\r\n"All right, it\'s me then, if you like!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind being in it, to give you a leg-up," said Wally, touched by\r\nthe heroism of his friend, "but you might let a chap bowl himself out,\r\nyou know.  All right, Yorke, it was me and D\'Arcy."\r\n\r\n"You should say _I_ and D\'Arcy," said Ranger.\r\n\r\n"What, were _you_ in it? Good old--"\r\n\r\n"No, you young ass; it\'s bad grammar to say _me_ and D\'Arcy were in it."\r\n\r\n"I never knew you were.  It\'s the first we\'ve heard of it; isn\'t it, you\r\nchaps?"\r\n\r\nThe chaps most emphatically agreed that it was.\r\n\r\n"Let them be, Ranger," said the captain.  "There\'ll be time enough for a\r\ngrammar lesson after."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t do it to-day, we\'ve got syntax this afternoon," said D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"Now, you youngsters, look here," said the captain.  "You may think\r\nyou\'re very clever; but this sort of thing is cheating, and cheating is\r\nwhat cads do.  We don\'t want any of it inside Fellsgarth.  Dangle, here\r\nare the youngsters, and here is the switch; will you lick them, or shall\r\nI?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to lick them.  Let them off," growled Dangle.\r\n\r\nThe hopes of the culprits rose for a moment, but they went down below\r\nzero when Yorke picked up the cane.\r\n\r\n"Wheatfield, come here."\r\n\r\nWally held out his case-hardened hand and received half a dozen cuts,\r\nfor which it is saying a good deal that they made the recipient dance.\r\n\r\nD\'Arcy followed, and received his six with meek indifference.  If he had\r\ncome first, he would probably have danced.  But as Wally had done that,\r\nhe stood firm.\r\n\r\nAshby received three cuts only, which astonished him dreadfully.  It was\r\nhis first acquaintance with the cane.  He had never realised before what\r\na venomous instrument it can be.  Still, he bore it like a man.\r\n\r\nPoor Fisher minor had a similar experience.  With his brother looking\r\non, and his messmates to watch how he bore it, he passed through the\r\nordeal creditably.  His three "Ohs" varied in cadence from anguish to\r\nsurprise, and from surprise to mild expostulation, "Oh!"  "Ehee!"  "Ow!"\r\nafter which he felt very pleased, on his brother\'s account, that he had\r\nnot shed tears.\r\n\r\n"Now cut," said the captain, "and if you\'re bowled out in that sort of\r\nthing again, you won\'t be let off so easy."\r\n\r\n"Yorke\'s a beast," said Wally, when the shattered forces mastered once\r\nmore in his study, "but he\'s a just beast.  He gave it us all hot\r\nalike."\r\n\r\nNo one disputed the proposition.\r\n\r\n"I thought he\'d let you new kids off, but he didn\'t.  It\'s just as well.\r\nIt\'ll do you good, and make you sit up."\r\n\r\n"Jolly sell for that cad Dangle," said D\'Arcy.  "He thought Yorke was\r\ngoing to shirk it."\r\n\r\n"He can\'t say that now," said Ashby, rubbing the palm of his hand up and\r\ndown his thigh.\r\n\r\nDangle, meanwhile, had returned to his quarters with the unsatisfactory\r\nreport of his mission.\r\n\r\n"Bother them!" said Clapperton.  "They take advantage of us whenever\r\nthere\'s a chance.  Now they\'ve offered a new election, and licked the\r\nyoungsters, the wind is out of our sails."\r\n\r\n"When it comes to the time, I shall decline to be nominated," said\r\nBrinkman.\r\n\r\n"That won\'t be much good.  You\'ll get some of our fellows voting for you\r\nwhether you stand or not.  And if some vote, all must."\r\n\r\n"We shall have to see all our men turn up," said Dangle.  "It was a\r\ntight enough shave for the secretaryship."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  If we don\'t carry it now, we\'d much better have left it alone.  I\r\nonly wish we had."\r\n\r\n"There\'s this to be said," said Dangle, anxious to make the best of his\r\nmistake; "if we do get three officers to their one, there should be no\r\ndoubt about our getting properly represented in the fifteen next week."\r\n\r\n"Ah--yes; we\'ve still that bone to pick with them."\r\n\r\nAs the Friday approached, signs of excitement in the coming conquest\r\nwere plainly visible.  By tacit agreement the return match between\r\nPercy\'s adherents and Wally\'s was postponed till after the election.\r\nAbsentees at the last election were diligently looked up by their\r\nrespective prefects, and ordered to be in attendance.  Minute\r\ncalculations were made by the knowing ones, which decided within one or\r\ntwo what Brinkman\'s majority would be.  Even in Wakefield\'s it was\r\nadmitted that the Classic chance was a slender one.\r\n\r\n"I wish it was all over," said Fisher major.  "I\'m getting sick of these\r\nprecious accounts already, and shall be glad to hand them over."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t lose them," said Dalton, "if we can help.  You may have to\r\nvote for yourself, though."\r\n\r\n"Catch me.  I\'ve come to the conclusion I wasn\'t born a treasurer, and I\r\ncouldn\'t conscientiously vote for myself.  I only wish I could back\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do that now," said his friend.  "Bless you, we can keep the\r\naccounts for you.  We couldn\'t for Brinkman."\r\n\r\nWhen morning school was over on the Friday, there was a general stampede\r\nfor the Hall, where boys crowded up for good seats a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore the time, and enlivened the interval with cheers and\r\ndemonstrations for their favourite candidate.  Wally and his friends\r\nwere particularly active in their corner, and addressed the meeting\r\ngenerally in favour of Fisher major.\r\n\r\n"Back up, you Classic kids!" shouted Wally, standing on his seat and\r\napostrophising a group of the Sixth who were standing near.  "Fisher\'s\r\nyour friend!  Won the mile in 4-38; batting average 34.658742.3;\r\nbowling, 12 wickets an innings, and 3 runs an over.  Never tells lies,\r\nor cheats.  Always comes home sober and gives silver in the collection.\r\nHe won\'t waste your money or cook your accounts, like some chaps; and\r\nhe\'ll run the ball up the field, instead of sitting down in the middle\r\nof the scrummage like the Modern chaps to keep warm.  Walk up! walk up!\r\nvote for Fisher and economy!  Hooray for Fisher!  Down with the swell\r\nmob!"\r\n\r\nAmid such torrents of eloquence the cause of Fisher major was not likely\r\nto go by default.\r\n\r\nBrinkman, too, was not without his champions, who, however, avoided set\r\nspeeches and confined themselves to personalities and generalities, such\r\nas--\r\n\r\n"Who cheats at Elections?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my hands, what a licking!"\r\n\r\n"How now--not me!"  (Here Fisher minor coloured up.) "Look out, you\r\nchaps, there\'s a Classic cad blushing."\r\n\r\n"No! where? won\'t he want a rest after it!"\r\n\r\n"Here comes Brinkman!  Hooray for honesty and fair play!  Hooray for the\r\nModerns!  Down with Wakefield\'s kids!  Send \'em home to their mas!"\r\n\r\n"Shut up there!  Sit down, you youngsters."\r\n\r\nWhereupon there fell a lull.\r\n\r\nFisher minor surveyed the scene with anxious trepidation.  If his\r\nbrother were to lose now, it would be his--Fisher minor\'s--fault.  He\r\nwould never be able to hold up his head again.  How he wished he had a\r\ndozen votes!\r\n\r\n"Strong muster," he heard some one say near him.  "I expect every\r\nfellow\'s here."\r\n\r\n"Except Rollitt."\r\n\r\n"Of, of course," said the other, with a laugh, "no one ever expects\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said Fisher minor to himself.  "Why shouldn\'t Rollitt come\r\nand vote?"\r\n\r\nHe quite shuddered at the audacity of the idea; and yet, when he looked\r\nup to the front and saw his brother standing there, worried and uneasy,\r\nand realised that in a few minutes he was to stand his ordeal, the\r\nyounger brother\'s courage rose within him, and he edged towards the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nIn due time Yorke arose.  This time, amid the vociferous cheers of his\r\nown side, a few of the Moderns ventured to mingle howls.  They soon\r\ndiscovered their mistake, for not even their own side was with them as a\r\nbody.  They were hooted down with execrations, and the result of this\r\ninterposition was that the captain was cheered for twice the usual time.\r\n\r\n"You fellows," said he, as soon as there was silence, "you probably\r\nunderstand from the notice why this meeting is called.  The last\r\nelection was very close, and I am sorry to say there was not fair play.\r\nI am still more sorry to say the offenders were juniors in Wakefield\'s,"\r\n(terrific yells and hoots from the Moderns), "who ought to have known\r\nbetter, and who I hope are thoroughly ashamed of themselves," (terrific\r\ncheers, during which, D\'Arcy, Wally, and Ashby, who had been standing on\r\na form, modestly took seats and exchanged defiant signals with the youth\r\nof the Modern side through the chinks of the crowd).  "They have had the\r\nlicking they deserve," ("Not half of it!" and laughter), "as Dangle\r\nhere, who was present at the time, will testify."  (Dangle scowled at\r\nthis reference--What right had the captain to score off him?).  "Of\r\ncourse under the circumstances it was necessary to have a new election.\r\nFisher here," (tremendous cheers, amidst which the culprits,\r\nconsidering that the storm had blown over, remounted their perches)\r\n"would scorn to be treasurer of the clubs, and everybody would scorn him\r\ntoo, if there was any suspicion of foul play about his election.  He has\r\nresigned, like an honest man; and our business is now to elect a\r\ntreasurer."  (Cheers and "Vote for Fisher major" from Wally.)\r\n\r\nDalton rose and proposed his friend Fisher major, which Ranger briefly\r\nseconded.\r\n\r\nDangle thereupon proposed Brinkman.  He was sorry the School was being\r\nput to the trouble of this new election.  They hadn\'t wanted it on their\r\nside; and his friend had been very reluctant to stand.  But of course,\r\nas the election was to take place, he hoped Brinkman would win by a\r\nmajority which would show the School what Fellsgarth thought about the\r\nfoul play which had been tried on at the last election.\r\n\r\nClapperton seconded the nomination, and assured his friends that, now\r\nthe offence had been acknowledged and atoned for by the castigation of\r\nthe offenders, they would try to forget it and feel to the other side as\r\nif it had not occurred.\r\n\r\nClapperton, of course, was cheered by his side; and yet his chief\r\nadmirers did not feel as proud of him as they would have liked.  His\r\ntone was patronising, and Fellsgarth could not stand being patronised,\r\neven by its captain.\r\n\r\nJust as the meeting was settling down for the important business of the\r\nvote, a sensational incident took place.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open, and in strode Rollitt, with Fisher minor, panting\r\nand pale, at his heels.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer, heedless of the astonishment caused by his appearance,\r\nstrode negligently up to the front where the other prefects were, while\r\nhis escort modestly slipped into the arms of his admiring friends.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the meeting looked on with amused bewilderment.  Then it\r\nsuddenly dawned on everybody that this meant a new voter; and terrific\r\nshouts of jubilation went up from the Classics; during which Fisher\r\nminor had his back thumped almost in two.\r\n\r\nFor once in his life he was a hero!  How he wished his young sisters\r\ncould have seen him then!\r\n\r\n"Never mind," shouted Percy across the room, "he\'s bound to vote the\r\nwrong side, or forget to vote at all."\r\n\r\n"Order!  Those who vote for Brinkman, hold up your hands."\r\n\r\nIt was far too serious to humbug now.  Even D\'Arcy was grave as he\r\nsurveyed the force of the enemy.\r\n\r\nTwo tellers had been appointed from either side, so that the votes were\r\ncounted four times, and the total was not allowed till all were agreed\r\non the result.\r\n\r\n"Brinkman has one hundred and twenty-eight votes."\r\n\r\nLoud and long were the cheers which greeted this announcement.  The\r\nknowing ones felt that it practically meant victory for the Moderns, for\r\nit was one more vote than Fisher major had won with last time.\r\n\r\n"Now, hands up for Fisher major."\r\n\r\nAmid dead silence the Classic hands went up.  Anxious eyes were cast in\r\nRollitt\'s direction.  But he, strange to say, was all there, and held up\r\nhis hand with the rest.\r\n\r\nFisher major himself at the last moment kept his own hand down.  He had\r\ndecided that, if Brinkman voted for himself, he would do the same.\r\nBrinkman had voted.  But, when it came to following his example, the\r\ncandidate\'s pride went on strike, and, whether it lost the election or\r\nnot, he declined to vote, Three of the tellers evidently agreed, but the\r\nother had to count again before he made the figure right.  Then the\r\nwritten paper was handed up to Yorke, "Brinkman 128, Fisher major, 129--\r\nFisher is elected."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nCARRIED NEM.  CON.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that in the midst of the excitement of School\r\npolitics the intellectual side of the Fellsgarth juniors, life was being\r\nquite neglected.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, they complained that so far from being neglected it was\r\nrather overdone.\r\n\r\nThe Classic juniors, for instance, suffered many things at the hands of\r\nthe cheerful Mr Stratton, who really worked hard to instil into their\r\nopening minds some rudiments of those studies from which their side took\r\nits name.  He took pains to explain not only when a thing was wrong, but\r\nwhy; and, unlike some of his calling, he devoted his chief attention to\r\nhis most backward boys.  This was his great offence in the eyes of\r\nD\'Arcy and Wally and some of their fraternity, because under the\r\narrangement they came in for the special attention alluded to.\r\n\r\n"That kid," said Wally, one day, _sotto voce_, as class was proceeding,\r\n"has no more idea of teaching than my hat.  We don\'t get a chance to\r\n_do_ things ourselves, with him always messing about and looking over.\r\nIt\'s rude to look over.  I mean to mark my exercise _private_ in\r\nfuture."\r\n\r\n"The thing is," said D\'Arcy, "if he\'d anything original to say it\r\nwouldn\'t matter so.  But he\'s always talking the same old rot about\r\nroots.  What\'s the use of a root, I should like to know, if you can\'t\r\nbury it?  Eh, kid?"\r\n\r\nFisher minor, to whom the question was addressed, did not know, and\r\nremarked that they didn\'t teach Latin here the same way as when he\r\nlearned from a governess at home.\r\n\r\nHe regretted this admission almost as soon as he had made it.  For Wally\r\nand D\'Arcy immediately got paper and began to draw fancy portraits of\r\nFisher minor learning Latin under the old _regime_.  The point of these\r\nillustrations was not so much in the figures as in the conversation.\r\nThe figures were more or less unlike the originals; at least, Fisher\r\nminor declared that the three isosceles triangles piled by Wally one on\r\nthe top of the other were not a bit like his governess; while the plum-\r\npudding on two sticks, with a little pudding above for a head which\r\nemitted four huge tears, the size of an orange, from either eye, he\r\nregarded as a simple libel on himself.  In one sense the likenesses were\r\nspeaking--that is, a gibbous balloon proceeded from the mouth of each\r\nfigure, wherein the following dialogue was indicated.\r\n"_Governess_.--`Naughty little Tommy-wommy, didn\'t know his Latin.\r\nTommy must have a smack when he goes bye-bye.\'  _Tommy_.--`Booh, hoo,\r\nhow bow, yow, wow, oh my!  I\'ll tell my ma!\'"\r\n\r\n"Bring up that paper, Wheatfield," said Mr Stratton.\r\n\r\nWally made a wild grab at Ashby\'s exercise, and was proceeding to take\r\nit up when the master stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Not that; the other, Wheatfield.  Bring it immediately."\r\n\r\nWhereupon Wally with shame had to rejoice Ashby\'s heart by restoring his\r\n_exercise_, and take up in its place the fancy portrait.\r\n\r\nMr Stratton gazed attentively and critically at this work of art.\r\n\r\n"Not at all well done, Wheatfield," said he.  "Sit down at my table here\r\nand draw me thirty copies of it before you leave this room.  Next boy,\r\ngo on."\r\n\r\nWally confessed, in later life, that of all the impositions he had had\r\nin the course of his chequered career, none had been more abominable and\r\nwearisome than this.  Oh, how he got to detest that governess and her\r\nward, and how sickening their talk became before the task was half over!\r\n\r\nHe sat in that room nearly three hours by the clock, groaning over this\r\ntask, and when at last he went in search of Mr Stratton with the\r\noriginal and thirty copies in his hand, he felt as limp and flabby,\r\nbodily and mentally, as he had ever done in his life.\r\n\r\nMr Stratton, who was having tea in his own room, examined each picture\r\nin turn, and rejected two as not fair copies of the original.\r\n\r\n"Do these two again--here," said he.\r\n\r\nWally meekly obeyed.  He had not a kick left in him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s better," said the young master when they were done.  "Now sit\r\ndown and have some tea."\r\n\r\nIt was a solemn meal.  Mr Stratton went quietly on with his meal,\r\nlooking up now and then to see that his guest was supplied with bread\r\nand butter and cake and biscuits.  Wally was equally silent.  He felt\r\nsore against the master, but he liked his cake--and the tea was "tip-\r\ntop."\r\n\r\nThe ceremony came to an end about the same time as the cake, and then\r\nMr Stratton said, pointing to the papers--\r\n\r\n"You can put them in the fire now, Wheatfield."\r\n\r\nWally obeyed with grim satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Thanks.  You can go now.  You must come another day and bring your\r\nfriends.  Good-bye," and he shook hands.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if the chap\'s all there," said Wally to himself as he limped\r\nover to his quarters.  "He forgot to jaw me.  Wonder if I ought to have\r\nreminded him?  Wonder who he gets his cake from?  I wouldn\'t care for\r\nmany more impots like that.  It was pretty civil of him asking me to\r\ntea, when you come to think of it.  Not sure I sha\'n\'t back him up a bit\r\nthis half, and make the chaps do so too.  Wonder if he meant all four of\r\nus to come to tea?  One cake wouldn\'t go round.  Besides, there\'s no\r\nsaying how that young cad Fisher minor would behave."\r\n\r\nThis little episode was not without its effect on all the occupants of\r\nWally\'s study.  For that young gentleman had not the slightest intention\r\nof turning over a new leaf by himself.  No, bother it; if he was going\r\nto "back up" Stratton, the other fellows would have to back up too.\r\n\r\nHis one grief was that the stock of impositions stored up by the\r\nindustry of the two new boys would not be likely to be wanted now, which\r\nwould be wicked waste.  D\'Arcy had already occasionally drawn on them,\r\nand one day nearly spoiled the whole arrangement by taking up to Mr\r\nWakefield fifty lines of Virgil precisely five minutes after they had\r\nbeen awarded.  Fortunately, however, his hands were exceedingly grimy at\r\nthe time, so that Mr Wakefield sent him back for ablutions before he\r\nwould communicate with him.  And in the interval he fortunately\r\ndiscovered his error, and instead of taking up the imposition with his\r\nclean hands, he delighted the master with a knotty inquiry as to one of\r\nthe active tenses of the Latin verb "To be."\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no saying when the impositions might not come in\r\nuseful, and meanwhile Ashby and Fisher minor were taken off the job and\r\nordered to sit up hard with their work for Stratton.\r\n\r\n"You know," said Wally, propounding his scheme of moral reform in a\r\nlittle preliminary speech, "you kids are not sent up here to waste your\r\ntime.  No more\'s D\'Arcy."\r\n\r\n"How do you know what I was sent up here for?" said D\'Arcy.  "It wasn\'t\r\nto hear your jaw."\r\n\r\n"Shut up.  I\'ve just been having tea with Stratton, and we were talking\r\nabout you chaps, him and I--I mean he and _me_."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t get on to English grammar, did you, while you were about\r\nit?" asked Ashby.\r\n\r\n"No.  Look here, you chaps, no larks.  It would be rather a spree if we\r\nput our back into it this term, wouldn\'t it?--beastly sell, you know,\r\nfor the others; and rather civil to Stratton too, for asking us to tea."\r\n\r\nThis last argument was more impressive than the first; and the company\r\nsaid they supposed they might.\r\n\r\n"All right--of course we may have to shut off a lark or two, but unless\r\nwe stick-- Hullo, I say, look at those Modern chaps down there punting a\r\nfootball on our side of the path!  Cheek!  Why, it\'s Cash and my young\r\nbrother.  I say, let\'s go and drive them off, you fellows."\r\n\r\nSo the four descended, and a brisk scrimmage ensued, which resulted in\r\nthe complete rout of the invaders and the capture of their football.\r\n\r\nWith which tremendous prize the victorious army returned to quarters and\r\ncontinued their discussion on moral reform.\r\n\r\n"Yes, as I was saying, we shall have to stick to it a bit.  But young\r\nStratton\'ll make it worth our while, I fancy."\r\n\r\nThis hidden allusion to the tea and cake completed the speaker\'s\r\nargument, and the party forthwith sat down with one ink-pot among them\r\nfor preparation.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the preparation for the day was an English Essay on\r\n"Your favourite Animal," with special attention to the spelling and the\r\nstops.\r\n\r\nIt was always a sore point with the Classic juniors to be set an English\r\nlesson.  They could understand being taught Latin, but they considered\r\nthey ought to be exempt from writing and spelling their own language.\r\nIt wasn\'t Classics, and they didn\'t like it, and they oughtn\'t to be let\r\nin for it.  However, it was no use growling; and as the subject (apart\r\nfrom the spelling and points) was a congenial one, it seemed a fair\r\nopening for the commencement of their reformed career.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Wally, "don\'t let\'s all have the same beast.  I\'m\r\ngoing to have a dog."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wanted a dog," said Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t; he\'s bagged.  Have a cat?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t like cats--can\'t I write about a dog too?"\r\n\r\n"That would be rot.  Haven\'t you got the whole of Noah\'s Ark to pick\r\nfrom--lions, tigers, ants, hippopotamuses, cobra de capellos?"\r\n\r\n"How much?" asked D\'Arcy.  "Are they good to eat?"\r\n\r\n"Uncommon good.  Will you take cobra de capellos?"\r\n\r\n"Ah right," said D\'Arcy; "I don\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"I shall take pigs," said Ashby.\r\n\r\n"There you are," said Wally; "there\'s lots left.  You have cows, kid--"\r\n\r\n"No--if you won\'t let me have the dog--"\r\n\r\n"Dog in the Wheatfield.  Joke!--laugh, you chaps," interjected D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"I shall have rabbits," said Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"Good old rabbits!  Did you ever keep any?  What were their names?" said\r\nWally.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know?" said Ashby, solemnly.  "One was called `How\' and the\r\nother `Now,\' weren\'t they, Fisher minor?"\r\n\r\nWhereupon there was mirth at the expense of Fisher minor.\r\n\r\nSilence having been procured, D\'Arcy began to write.\r\n\r\n"`Cobbrer de Capillars is my favrite--\' What is it?  Bird, beast, or\r\nfish, Wally?"\r\n\r\n"Shut up; bird, of course."\r\n\r\n"`Bird,\'" continued the essayist.  "`It was in Nore\'s arck and is good\r\neating\'--that\'s all I know about it.  Tell us something more, Wally,\r\nthere\'s a good chap."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother.  Don\'t go disturbing, it spoils everything."\r\n\r\n"`The cobberer oart not to be disterbd for it spoyls everything--it\r\nspoyls your close and--\' wire in, Wally, what else does it do?  You\r\nmight tell a chap."\r\n\r\n"What I\'ll do to you, you cad, and that\'s pull your nose if you don\'t\r\nshut up!" retorted Wally, who was busy over his own theme.\r\n\r\n"`--and puis yore knows if yore a cad, and don\'t shut up.\'  There,\r\nbother it, that ought to do--twelve lines.  Good enough for him."\r\n\r\n"Stuck in the stops?" asked Ashby.\r\n\r\n"No; by the way--glad you reminded me--I suppose about every four words,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n"Something about that," said Ashby.\r\n\r\nSo D\'Arcy sprinkled a few stops judiciously through his copy, and having\r\ndone so began to upbraid his partners for their slowness.\r\n\r\nSome time was lost in suppressing him, but he was eventually disposed of\r\nunder the bath, which was turned upside down to accommodate him and sat\r\nupon by the other three, who were thus able to continue their work in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nAshby was done first.  He had a congenial subject and wrote _con amore_.\r\n\r\n"I shall now say something about the pig which is my favourite annimal--\r\nThe pig is a quadruped--Sometimes he is male in which case he is called\r\na hog.  Sometimes he is female in which case he is called a sow.  Pigs\r\nwere rings in their noses and are fond of apple-peal.  Their young are\r\ncalled litter and are very untidy in their habbits.  Pig\'s cheek is nice\r\nto eat and pork in season is a treat."  (The writer was very proud of\r\nthis little outbreak of poetry.)\r\n\r\n"It is preferrablest roast with sage and apple sauce.  I hope I have now\r\ndescribed the pig and told you why he is my favourite."\r\n\r\nFisher minor, on the uncongenial topic of the rabbit, found composition\r\ndifficult and punctuation impossible.\r\n\r\n"I like rabbits next best to dogs which Wally has taken mine were black\r\nand white one was one and the other the other the white one died first\r\nof snuffles he had lobears the other had the same pequliarity and was\r\nswoped for 2 white mice who eskaped the first-night owing to the size of\r\nthe bars there is a kind of rabbit called welsh rabbit that my father is\r\nfond of he says it goes best on toast but I give mine oats and bran it\r\nis a mistake for boys to keep rabbits because first they give them too\r\nmuch and burst them and then they give them too little and starve them\r\nwhich is not wright and makes the rabbit skinny to eat if a boy feeds\r\nrabbits well he can get his mother to give him half-a-crown a peace to\r\nmake pies of them which is very agreeable so I therefore on this account\r\nconsider rabbits favourites."\r\n\r\nBefore this conclusion had been reached, Wally, with a complacent smile,\r\nhad laid down his pen, flattering himself he had made a real good thing\r\nof the dog.  He scorned commonplace language, and, mindful of the\r\neloquent periods of certain newspapers of his acquaintance, had "let\r\nout" considerably on his favourite theme, which, if the spelling and\r\npunctuation had been as good as the language, would have been a fine\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n"The dog is the sublymest, gift of beficient nature to the zografical\r\nSpeeches, He has been the confidenshul playmate of; man since before the\r\ncreation, he is compounded of the most plezing trays and Generaly ansers\r\nto the endeering name of carlo? if you put his noes at the extremity of\r\na rat-Hole he: will continue their ad libbitums till he has his man; In\r\nBarberous lands there is an exorable law ordayning muscles but It can be\r\ninvaded by a little despeshun and sang frore, as one side of the streat\r\nis not unfrequentedly Outside the rools so that if you take him that\r\nside the politician cannot Run him in which is the wulgar for lagging\r\nhim for not [waring Mussles I have] ockasionaly done bobys this Way\r\nmyself so that I am convinzed of my voracity, the lesson we learn from\r\nthis is that dogs should be treeted kindly and not Injected to unkind\r\ntretemant there? was Ice a dog with the pattrynamie of dognes who lived\r\nin a tub but; tubs are not helthy kenels because, they Roal when you\r\ndont stick brix under, which teechus to be kind `to our\' fello animals\r\nand pleze Our masters--I will.

"Now I vote we stow\r\nit, and--"\r\n\r\nHere there was a loud knock at the door and a senior\'s voice calling,\r\n"Open the door, you youngsters."\r\n\r\nThe intruder was Dangle, at sight of whom the backs of our four heroes\r\nwent up.\r\n\r\n"What do you youngsters mean by bagging one of our balls!" said the\r\nModern senior.  "Give it me directly."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t belong to you," said Wally; "it\'s my young brother\'s."\r\n\r\n"Do you hear?--give it to me," said Dangle.  "He can fetch it if he\r\nwants it.  You\'re not our prefect," retorted Wally.\r\n\r\nNone of the four were more astounded than Wally himself at the audacity\r\nof this speech.  It must have been due to the exhilarating effect of his\r\ntea and essay combined.\r\n\r\nDangle was evidently unprepared for defiance of this sort and became\r\nthreatening.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t give me that ball at once, I\'ll give the lot of you the\r\nbest hiding you ever had in your lives."\r\n\r\n"Try it.  We\'re not going to give up the ball.  There!  If Percy wants\r\nit, let him come for it.  Back up, you chaps."\r\n\r\nIn a tussle between one big boy and four small ones, the odds are\r\nusually in favour of the former, but Dangle on the present occasion did\r\nnot find his task quite as easy as he expected.  The juniors defended\r\nthemselves with great tenacity, and although the senior\'s blows came\r\nhome pretty hard, he could only deal with them one at a time.  It got to\r\nbe a little humiliating to discover that he would have to fight hard to\r\ngain his end, and his temper evaporated rapidly.\r\n\r\nSeizing his opportunity, when Fisher minor, who had been fighting\r\nperhaps the least steadily of the four--yet doggedly enough--was within\r\nreach, he struck out at him wildly, determined to get him disposed of\r\nfirst.  It was a cruel blow even for a fellow in Dangle\'s plight.  The\r\nsmall boy recoiled half-stunned, and uttered a yell which for an instant\r\nstartled the bully.\r\n\r\nBefore Dangle had time to recover, the three survivors were upon him\r\ntooth and nail; at the same moment the door opened again, and Rollitt,\r\nof all persons, stood in the room.\r\n\r\nHe took in the situation at a glance--the big boy white with rage, his\r\nthree assailants with heads down and lips tight, pounding away, and\r\nFisher minor leaning against the wall with his handkerchief to his face.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said he in a voice which suspended hostilities at once.  Then\r\nturning to Dangle he said--\r\n\r\n"Get out."\r\n\r\nDangle glared defiantly, and remained where he was, whereupon Rollitt,\r\nwithout another word, lifted him in his arms like a child, and slinging\r\nhim across his shoulders marched forth.\r\n\r\nWakefield\'s boys were just trooping up the staircase from the fields,\r\nand at this strange apparition stood still and made a lane for it to\r\npass.  Dangle\'s struggles were futile.  The giant, if he was aware of\r\nthem, heeded them no more than the kicking of a kitten, and proceeded\r\ndeliberately down the stairs, past everybody, juniors, middle-boys,\r\nprefects and all, and walked with his burden out at the door.  There\r\nevery one expected the scene would end.\r\n\r\nBut no.  He walked on sedately across the Green.  Indifferent as to who\r\nsaw him or what they said, until he came to the door of Forder\'s house,\r\nwhere he entered.  Up the stairs he stumped amid gaping juniors and\r\nmenacing middle, boys until he reached his captive\'s study; where\r\nwithout ceremony he deposited him, and, not vouchsafing a word, turned\r\non his heel.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, no one had the presence of mind to challenge him or\r\ndemand reparation for the insult to their house.  He neither dawdled nor\r\nhurried.\r\n\r\nAt the door a bodyguard of Classics had assembled to meet him and escort\r\nhim back.  But he had no need of their services.  He made his way\r\nthrough them as coolly as if he was coming from class; and utterly\r\nindifferent to the rising clamour and shouts behind him--for the Moderns\r\nhad by this time recovered breath enough to use their tongues--reached\r\nWakefield\'s, where without a word to any one he proceeded to his own\r\nstudy and shut himself in to continue the scientific experiments which\r\nhad only been interrupted a few minutes before by the sudden cry of\r\ndistress from the one boy in Fellsgarth to whom he owed the least\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nHOW PERCY GOT BACK HIS FOOTBALL.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that in the present state of party feeling at\r\nFellsgarth the incident recorded in the last chapter would be confined\r\nto a personal quarrel between Dangle and Rollitt.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that it takes two to make a quarrel, there was not much to\r\nbe feared in the latter respect.  For Rollitt was apparently unaware\r\nthat he had done anything calling for general remark, and went his ways\r\nwith his customary indifference.\r\n\r\nWhen Dangle, egged on by the indignation of his friends, had gone across\r\nto find him and demand satisfaction, Rollitt had told him to call again\r\nto-morrow, as he was busy.\r\n\r\nDangle therefore called again.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come to ask if you mean to apologise for what you did the other\r\nday?  If you don\'t--"\r\n\r\n"Get out!" said Rollitt, going on with his work.\r\n\r\n"--If you don\'t," continued Dangle, "you\'ll have to take the\r\nconsequences."\r\n\r\n"Get out!"\r\n\r\n"If you funk it, Rollitt, you\'d better say so."\r\n\r\n"Get out," said Rollitt, rising slowly to his feet.\r\n\r\nDangle reported, when he got back to his house, that argument had been\r\nhopeless.  Yet he meant to take it out of his adversary some other way.\r\n\r\nBut if the principals in the quarrel were inactive, their adherents on\r\neither side took care to keep up the feud.\r\n\r\nThe Modern juniors especially, who felt very sore at the indignity put\r\nupon their house, took up the cudgels very fiercely.  Secretly they\r\nadmitted that Dangle had cut rather a poor figure, and that they could\r\nhave made a much better job over the impounded football than he had by\r\nhis interference.  But that had nothing to do with the conduct of the\r\nenemy, whom they took every opportunity of defying and deriding.\r\n\r\n"There go the sneaks," shouted Lickford, as the four Classic juniors\r\nparaded arm in arm across the Green.  "Who got licked by our chap and\r\nhad to squeal for a prefect to come and help them?  Oh my--waterspouts!"\r\n\r\n"Ya--_how now_--_oh no, not me_!"  Percy shouted for the special benefit\r\nof Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"Look at them!  They daren\'t come our side.  Cowards!--daren\'t come on\r\nto our side of the path," chimed in Cash.\r\n\r\n"Look at their short legs," called Ramshaw; "only useful for cutting\r\naway when they see a Modern."\r\n\r\n"Who got licked on the hands for cheating at Elections, and blubbed like\r\nanything!" put in Cottle.\r\n\r\nThe four heroes walked on, hearing every word and trying to appear as if\r\nthey did not.  They spoke to one another with forced voices and\r\nmechanical smiles, and did their best not to be self-conscious in the\r\nmatter of their legs.\r\n\r\nBut as the defiance grew bolder in proportion as they walked further,\r\nWally said--\r\n\r\n"I say, this is a drop too much.  We can\'t stand this, eh?"\r\n\r\n"No; the cads!" chimed in the other three.\r\n\r\n"Tell you what," said Wally, "it wouldn\'t be a bad joke to have a punt-\r\nabout with their football right under their noses, would it?"\r\n\r\n"How if they bag it?"\r\n\r\n"Bother!--we must chance that."\r\n\r\n"I say," said Ashby, "if we could bag their boots first!"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t do that; but we might wait till they\'re in their class after\r\nbreakfast in the morning.  They go in half an hour before us.  I know,\r\nthey all sit near the window, and are squinting out at everybody that\r\npasses.  Won\'t they squirm?"\r\n\r\nNext morning therefore at early school, as Percy and Company sat huddled\r\nat their desks in the Modern class-room, biting their pens, groaning\r\nover their sums, and gazing dismally from the window all at the same\r\ntime, they had the unspeakable anguish of beholding Wally, D\'Arcy,\r\nAshby, and Fisher minor, with _their_ ball, having a ding-dong game of\r\npunt-about on the sacred Modern grass, under their very eyes.\r\n\r\nHow these four enjoyed themselves and kicked about the ball, nodding and\r\nkissing their hands all the while at the mortified enemy, who sat like\r\ncaged beasts glaring at them through their bars, and gnawing their\r\nfingers in impotent fury!\r\n\r\nSometimes, to add a little relish to the sport, they invited a passing\r\nprefect of their own house to give the ball a punt, and once a neat\r\ndrop-kick from D\'Arcy left a muddy splotch on the face of the sundial\r\nabove border\'s door.\r\n\r\nThis was too much; and when, a few minutes later, they caught sight of\r\nthe marauders waving to them and calling attention by pantomimic gesture\r\nto the fact that they were carrying off the ball once more to their own\r\nquarters, Percy could contain himself no longer.\r\n\r\n"Beasts!" he ejaculated.\r\n\r\n"Wheatfield," said Mr Forder, who was in charge of the class, "write me\r\nout fifty lines of the _Paradise Lost_ and a letter of apology in Latin\r\nfor using bad language in class."\r\n\r\nPercy was conducted home by his friends that morning in a critical\r\nstate.  He felt it necessary to kick somebody, and therefore kicked\r\nthem; and they, entirely misunderstanding his motives, kicked back.\r\nConsequently, a good deal of time was occupied in arranging matters all\r\nround on a comfortable footing; by the end of which time the fraternity,\r\nthough marred in visage, felt generally easier in its mind.\r\n\r\nIt was no use appealing to the Modern prefects.  They had made a mess of\r\nit so far, and weren\'t to be trusted.  Nor did the course of lodging a\r\ncomplaint with Yorke commend itself to the company.  It might be\r\nmistaken for telling tales.  How would it do to--\r\n\r\nHere entered Robert, the school porter, with a letter addressed\r\n"Wheatfield minor, Mr Forder\'s," in a scholarly hand.\r\n\r\n"Wheatfield minor," snarled Percy; "that\'s not me, Bob.  What do you\r\ntake me for!  Here, take it over to Wakefield\'s, and look about for the\r\ndirtiest, ugliest, beastliest kid you can see.  That\'s Wheatfield\r\nminor."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be sore to know him by his likeness to Percy," added Cash, by\r\nway of encouragement.\r\n\r\n"But Wakefield\'s ain\'t Forder\'s," observed the sage Robert.  "Look what\r\nthe envelope says."\r\n\r\nTrue; it must be meant for Percy after all.\r\n\r\n"You go and tell him it\'s like his howling cheek to call me minor,\r\nwhoever it is; and when I catch him I\'ll welt him.  Do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir, I\'ll tell him," said the porter with a grin.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Percy had opened the letter and caught sight of the signature.\r\n\r\nHe uttered a whistle of amazement.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" he cried, "it\'s from Stratton!  Whatever--Oh, I say, Bob, it\r\ndoesn\'t matter about that message; do you hear!"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t be no trouble, sir," said the porter.\r\n\r\n"If I want to give it I\'ll do it myself," said Percy.\r\n\r\n"Whatever\'s it about?" said his friends.\r\n\r\n"Dear Wheatfield minor,"--(cheek!) read Percy, "Mrs Stratton and I will\r\nbe glad to see you and three or four of your friends to tea this evening\r\nat six.  I will arrange with Mr Forder to give you exeats from\r\npreparation."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" grunted Percy--"rather civil--I hear he gives rather good grub.\r\nI vote we go."\r\n\r\n"May as well.  It gets us off preparation too," said Cash.\r\n\r\n"Who said _you_ were in it?" replied Percy.  "Catch me taking you unless\r\nyou behave.  I\'ve a good mind to take Clapperton and Brinkman and Dangle\r\nand Fullerton."\r\n\r\nThis threat reduced the clan to obedience at once, and Percy sat down\r\npresently, and wrote in his most admired style--\r\n\r\n"Wheatfield major," (the "major" was heavily underlined) "is much\r\nobliged to Mr Stratton for his invitation to him to tea in his room,\r\nand he will be glad to bring the following of his friends, if he has no\r\nobjection, with him; viz.  Lickford, Ramshaw, Cash, and Cottle.  With\r\nkind regards from P.W.;" and sent the note over by the hand of the\r\nyoungest of the Modern juniors.\r\n\r\nThis diversion served for a time to heal the mental ravages of the\r\nmorning, and to occupy the attention of the company most of the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n"Case of Sunday-go-to-meeting, isn\'t it?" said lickford.\r\n\r\n"Rather.  Mind you tog up well, you chaps; I\'m not going to take four\r\nlouts out to tea with me, I promise you."\r\n\r\nWhereupon ensued great searchings of hearts and wardrobes, to see what\r\ncould be done in the way of appropriate decoration.  The invitation came\r\nat an awkward time, for it was Friday afternoon, and Mrs Wisdom rarely\r\nsent home the washing before Saturday.  Consequently it was a work of\r\nsome difficulty to muster five clean collars among the party, still less\r\nas many shirt-fronts.\r\n\r\nLickford spent at least an hour over his last Sunday\'s shirt with ink-\r\neraser, trying to get it to look tidy; while Cottle, more ingenious,\r\nneatly gummed pieces of white paper over the dirty spots on his.\r\n\r\nA great discussion took place as to chokers.  Percy, who had one,\r\nthreatened to leave behind any one not similarly adorned.  It was only\r\nby adroit cajolery, and persuading him that he, as personal conductor of\r\nthe party, had a right to be sweller than the rest, that he could be\r\ninduced to waive the point.\r\n\r\nThe same argument had to be urged with regard to boots, as none of the\r\nothers had patent leathers, which Percy insisted was the first thing any\r\none looked to see if you had on at a party.  It was urged that as most\r\nof the time would be spent with the feet under the table, this, though\r\nsound in law, was not in the present case of such vital importance in\r\nequity.  Objection waived once more.\r\n\r\nFinally, when all was ready, Percy held a full-dress parade of his\r\nforces, and looked each of them up and down as minutely and critically\r\nas an officer of the Guards inspecting his company.  He objected to Cash\r\nwearing white gloves, as he had none himself, and he nearly cashiered\r\nCottle for having a coloured handkerchief, because he himself had a\r\nbrand-new white one.  At length, however, all these little details were\r\narranged, and as the school clock began to chime the hour the order to\r\nmarch was given, and the company proceeded at the double to Mr\r\nStratton\'s house.\r\n\r\nMr Stratton was more or less of a favourite with both sides at\r\nFellsgarth.  He had a small house, in which were representatives of both\r\nfactions, but most of them of the quieter sort, who, being obliged to\r\nlive together under one roof, did not see so much to quarrel about out\r\nof doors.  Mr Stratton, too, took the juniors\' divisions of each\r\nschool, and so kept fairly well in touch with both.  Add to this, that\r\nhe was a good all round athlete, that he had a serene and cheerful\r\ntemper, and, what is of scarcely less importance, a charming young wife,\r\nand you have several very good reasons why he was one of the most\r\npopular masters at Fellsgarth.  The juniors, on the whole, appreciated\r\nhim.  When he was down on them they forgave him on account of his youth,\r\nand when he complained that he could not get them to understand his\r\nprecepts, they asked one another whose fault was that.  Occasionally he\r\ncondoned all his offences by an act of hospitality, and for once in a\r\nway betrayed that he recognised the merits of a select few of his pupils\r\nby asking them to tea.\r\n\r\nThis was evidently the ease now, and as our five young Moderns trotted\r\nacross the Green, they wished their enemies in Wakefield\'s could only\r\nhave looked out and witnessed their triumph.\r\n\r\nLittle they dreamed that at that moment Wally, Ashby, D\'Arcy, and Fisher\r\nminor, resplendent in shirts and collars fresh from the wash, with their\r\neight hands encased in white kid and their eight feet in patent leather,\r\nwere standing about in Mr Stratton\'s drawing-room, wondering who on\r\nearth it was whose non-arrival was preventing the ringing of the tea-\r\nbell.\r\n\r\nWhen presently Percy and his party were ushered in, and discovered who\r\nwere their fellow-guests, it did some credit to their breeding that they\r\nremembered to go up and shake hands with Mr and Mrs Stratton, and did\r\nnot immediately fly at the enemy\'s throat.  The enemy, however, were\r\nequally taken aback, and were fully entitled to half the credit for the\r\nself-control with which the discovery was received.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no need to introduce you to one another, I\'m sure," said Mr\r\nStratton.  "By the way, Wheatfield--you I mean," pointing to Percy, "I\r\nmust apologise for calling you minor.  It was very kind of you to put me\r\nright."\r\n\r\nWally glared up at this, and would have liked to put the matter right\r\nthere and then, but Mrs Stratton said--\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t fair to number twins at all, is it?"\r\n\r\n"Unless," suggested D\'Arcy, blushing to find himself talking, "unless\r\nyou reckon them half each."\r\n\r\nThis only mended matters to the extent of raising a laugh at the expense\r\nof the twins, who felt mutually uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe tea-bell, however, relieved the tension, "Come," said the hostess.\r\n"You must take one another in.  No, that won\'t do, all Mr Wakefield\'s\r\nboys together.  Two of you come this side--that\'s right; and Cottle and\r\nRamshaw, you go over there.  Now, you\'re beautifully sorted.  Edward,\r\ndear, you mustn\'t talk till you\'ve handed round the tea-cake to our\r\nguests.  Lickford, do you take cream and sugar?  And you too, twins?  Oh\r\nreally, dear, you don\'t call those slices, do you?  Do let Ashby cut up\r\nthe cake; I\'m sure he knows better than you what a slice is; don\'t you,\r\nAshby?"\r\n\r\nApparently Ashby did; and the party, thus genially thrown together and\r\nset to work, soon began, to experience the balmy influences of a\r\nconvivial high tea.\r\n\r\nVery little was spoken at first except by Mr Stratton, who gave a brief\r\naccount of a University cricket match in which he had once played--a\r\nnarrative which served as a most soothing refrain to the silent exercise\r\nin which his listeners were engaged.  Presently a few questions were put\r\nin by the boys, followed by a few observations which gradually, by the\r\nadroit piloting of the host, loyally backed up by his wife, developed\r\ninto a discussion on the use and abuse of "third man up" in modern\r\ncricket.  After this knotty point was disposed of the talk grew more\r\ngeneral, and Wally became aware that his brother was handing him the\r\napricot jam.\r\n\r\nThe act, simple in itself, meant a great deal to Wally.  He liked\r\napricot jam, and had not been able to get at it all the evening.  As he\r\nnow helped himself he admitted to himself that Percy was not quite such\r\na lout as he had occasionally thought him.\r\n\r\n"Thanks awfully, Percy.  Did you like that toffee I gave you the other\r\nday?"\r\n\r\n"Rather.  It was spiffing," said Percy.  "I say, I don\'t mind writing\r\nhome this week if you like."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t you grind; I will."\r\n\r\n"Really I don\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"No more do I.  I say, can you reach the butter?"\r\n\r\n"Rather.  Better rinse this dish up here between us.  There\'s another\r\ndown there."\r\n\r\nSimilar scenes of reconciliation were taking place elsewhere.  Cottle\r\nwas asking Ashby his riddle; D\'Arcy was laying down the law in the\r\nadmiring hearing of Ramshaw and Lickford as to the cooking of sprats on\r\nthe shovel; while Fisher minor was telling the sympathetic Mrs Stratton\r\nall about the people at home.  Mr Stratton was wise enough not to\r\ndisturb this state of affairs by talk of his own.  When, however, the\r\nmeal began to flag, and his guests one by one abandoned the attack, he\r\nproposed an adjournment to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"I want the advice of you youngsters," said he presently, "about\r\nsomething I dare say you all know something about.  I mean the old\r\nSchool shop."\r\n\r\nThe party looked guilty.  Didn\'t they know the tuck-shop?\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said Mr Stratton, "it\'s rather in a bad way just now;\r\ndon\'t you think so?  Robert hasn\'t time to look after it, and wants to\r\ngive it up.  He says it doesn\'t pay; and really some of his things\r\naren\'t particularly nice.  I went and had a jam tart there this morning.\r\nIt was like shoe-leather; and the jam was almost invisible."\r\n\r\nWally laughed.  He knew those tarts well.\r\n\r\n"I think it would be a pity if it was given up; don\'t you?  We all want\r\na little grub now and then; besides, it\'s an old School institution."\r\n\r\n"Robert charges three-halfpence a-piece for those tarts," said D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"Yes--think of that.  I\'ve no doubt you could get them for half the\r\nprice at Penchurch.  What I was thinking was, why shouldn\'t some of us\r\ncarry on the shop ourselves?"\r\n\r\nThe boys opened their eyes.  The idea of carrying on a tuck-shop on\r\ntheir own account opened a vista of such endless possibilities, that\r\nthey were quite startled.\r\n\r\n"It ought to be easy enough if we manage properly," said Mr Stratton.\r\n"Suppose, now, we who are here were to form a committee and decide to\r\nrun the shop, how should we begin?"\r\n\r\n"It depends on what Robert left behind," said Percy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we wouldn\'t take over any of his stuff.  No, the first thing would\r\nbe to reckon up how much we should want to start with, and either club\r\ntogether or get some one to advance it.  How many tarts do you suppose\r\nare sold a day?"\r\n\r\n"Hundreds," said Ashby.\r\n\r\n"Well, according to Robert, about eighty.  But say one hundred.  That at\r\na penny each would be about 8 shillings for tarts.  Then the ginger-\r\nbeer.  Would twenty bottles do?  That would be 3 shillings 4 pence,\r\nsupposing they cost 2 pence each.  That\'s 11 shillings 4 pence.  What\r\nnext?  Apples?  Suppose we put them down at 2 shillings 6 pence--13\r\nshillings 10 pence.  Sweets?  Well, say 2 shillings 6 pence more--16\r\nshillings 4 pence.  Nuts 1 shilling--17 shillings 4 pence.  It mounts\r\nup, you see.  We ought at least to have 25 or 30 shillings to start\r\nwith.  Well, I happen to know somebody who would lend that amount to the\r\nshareholders for a little time if we should want it.  Now suppose we\'ve\r\ngot our money.  We ought to send to some of the best shops and market\r\npeople in the town to see what we could get our things for.  As it\r\nhappens, Mrs Stratton when she was in Penchurch this morning did\r\ninquire, and this is her report.  The tarts that we should sell for a\r\npenny we could get for three farthings each, so that on a hundred tarts\r\nwe should make a profit of 2 shillings 1 penny.  And the confectioner\r\nwould send his cart up every day with fresh tarts of different kinds of\r\njam, and take back yesterday\'s stale ones at half-price.  That would be\r\na great improvement, wouldn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Rather," said everybody.\r\n\r\n"Then the ginger-beer.  Would you believe it, if we undertake to take\r\nnot less than twelve bottles a day daring the half we can get them for a\r\npenny each, and might sell them for three-halfpence.  That would make a\r\ngreat increase in the demand, I fancy, and every bottle we can sell, we\r\nmake a dear halfpenny profit.  The same with the sweets.  You can get\r\nmost sorts for 9 or 10 pence a pound, and if we sell at a penny an\r\nounce, you see we get 7 or 8 pence profit.  I should vote for only\r\ngetting the best kind of sweets, and making rather less profit than\r\nthat.  At any rate, you see, if we are careful, we ought pretty soon to\r\nbe able to pay back what we owe, and after providing for the expense of\r\na person to mind the shop and do the selling, put by a little week by\r\nweek, which will go to the School clubs or anything else the fellows\r\ndecide.  What do you think of the plan?"\r\n\r\nThey all thought it would be magnificent.\r\n\r\n"I see no reason why you youngsters should not manage it splendidly by\r\nyourselves at soon as you get once started.  You\'ll have to draw up\r\nstrict rules, of course, for managing the shop, and make up the\r\naccounts; and look out sharp that you aren\'t selling anything at a loss.\r\nRemember, the cheaper you can sell (provided you get a fair profit),\r\nthe more customers you\'ll have.  And the better your stuff is, the more\r\nit will be liked.  Mrs Stratton says she will act as banker, and take\r\ncare of the money at the end of each day and pay out what you want for\r\nstores.  Don\'t say anything about it out of doors at present; talk it\r\nover among yourselves daring the week, and if you think it will work,\r\ntell me, and we\'ll have a regular business meeting to settle\r\npreliminaries.  Now suppose we have a game of crambo?"\r\n\r\nWhen the party broke up, Moderns and Classics strolled affectionately\r\nacross the Green arm in arm, deep in confabulation as to the projected\r\nshop.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the door of Wakefield\'s, Wally said, "By the way, have\r\nany of you chaps lost a football?  There\'s one kicking about in our\r\nroom.  Hang outside and I\'ll chuck it to you out of the window."\r\n\r\nWhich he did.  And the ball proved to be the very one the Moderns had\r\nlost a week ago!  How curious!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nFELLSGARTH VERSUS RENDLESHAM.\r\n\r\nHow it came that Rollitt played, after all, in the Rendlesham match, no\r\none could properly understand.\r\n\r\nHis name was not down on the original list.  Yorke _had_ given up asking\r\nhim to play, as he always either excused himself, or, what was worse,\r\npromised to come and failed at the last moment.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of the Moderns at the second election, the question of\r\nthe selection of the fifteen had been allowed to drop; and those who\r\nwere keen on victory hoped no further difficulty would arise.  Two days\r\nbefore the match, however, Brinkman was unlucky enough to hurt his foot,\r\nand to his great mortification was forbidden by the doctor to play.  The\r\nnews of his accident caused general consternation, as he was known to be\r\na good forward and a useful man in a scrimmage.  Clapperton increased\r\nthe difficulty by coming over to say that as Brinkman was laid up, he\r\nhad arranged for Corder to play instead.\r\n\r\nCorder, as it happened, was a Modern senior, a small fellow, and reputed\r\nan indifferent player.\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t do at all," said Yorke, decisively.\r\n\r\n"Why not?  Surely we\'ve got a right to find a substitute for our own\r\nman," said Clapperton, testily.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by your own man?  Who cares twopence whose man he is,\r\nas long as he plays up?  The fifteen are Fellsgarth men, and no more\r\nyours than they are mine."\r\n\r\n"If they were as much mine as yours no one would complain."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say that if you were captain of the fifteen you\'d put\r\nCorder in the team for a first-class match?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?  There are plenty worse than he."\r\n\r\n"There are so many better, that he is out of the question."\r\n\r\n"That means only five of our men are to play against ten of yours."\r\n\r\n"You\'re talking rot, Clapperton, and you know it.  If I\'m captain, I\'ll\r\nchoose my own team.  If you don\'t like it, or if the best fifteen men in\r\nthe school aren\'t in it, you are welcome to complain.  I hope you will."\r\n\r\n"It strikes me pretty forcibly our fellows won\'t fancy being snubbed\r\nlike this.  It would be a bad job if they showed as much on the day of\r\nthe match."\r\n\r\n"It would be a bad job--for them," said the captain.\r\n\r\nWhen Yorke repeated this disagreeable conversation to his friends later\r\non, they pulled long faces.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he means they don\'t intend to play up," said Dalton.\r\n\r\n"If that\'s so," said Fisher major, "why not cut them all out and make up\r\nthe fifteen of fellows you can depend on?"\r\n\r\n"That wouldn\'t do," said Yorke.  "I expect when the time comes they\'ll\r\nplay up all right.  After all, Clapperton and Fullerton are two of our\r\nbest men."\r\n\r\n"But what about the vacant place?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve four or five names all better than Corder," said the captain, "but\r\nnone of them as good as Brinkman."\r\n\r\nThe company generally, it is to be feared, did not lament as honestly as\r\nYorke did, the accident to their rival.  They did not profess to\r\nrejoice, of course; still they bore the blow with equanimity.\r\n\r\nNext morning, to the astonishment of everybody, the notice board\r\ncontained an abrupt announcement in the captain\'s hand, that in\r\nconsequence of Brinkman\'s inability to play, Rollitt would take his\r\nplace in the fifteen.\r\n\r\nYorke himself could not account for this sudden act of patriotism.\r\nRollitt, he said, had looked into his room last night at bedtime and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"I\'ll play on Saturday," and vanished.\r\n\r\nFisher minor was perhaps, of all persons, better able to explain the\r\nmystery than any one else.  He had overheard in Ranger\'s study a general\r\nlamentation about the prospects for Saturday, and a wish expressed by\r\nhis brother that Rollitt were not so unsociable and undependable.\r\nEverybody agreed it was utterly useless to ask him to play, and that\r\nthey would have to get a second-rate man to fill the empty place, and so\r\nmost probably lose the match.\r\n\r\nFisher minor heard all this, and when presently, on his way to his own\r\nden, he passed Rollitt\'s door, a tremendous resolution seized him to\r\ntake upon himself the duty of ambassador extraordinary for the School.\r\nRollitt appeared to owe him no grudge for throwing stones the other day,\r\nand had already come to his relief handsomely at the time of the second\r\nelection and in the affair with Dangle.  On the whole, Fisher minor\r\nthought he might venture.\r\n\r\nRollitt was reading hard by the light of one small candle when he\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n"Please, Rollitt," said the boy, "would you ever mind playing for the\r\nSchool on Saturday?"\r\n\r\nRollitt looked up in such evident alarm that Fisher major put his hand\r\non the latch of the door, and made ready to bolt.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see--get out," said Rollitt.\r\n\r\nAnd Fisher minor did get out.\r\n\r\nIt was really too absurd to suppose that Rollitt was going to play in\r\nthe fifteen to oblige Fisher minor.  So at least thought that young\r\ngentleman, and remained discreetly silent about his interview, hoping\r\ndevoutly no one would hear of it.\r\n\r\nThe joy of the Classics was almost equal to the fury of the Moderns.\r\nThe latter could not deny that Rollitt was a host in himself, and worth\r\na dozen Corders.  Yet it galled them to see him quietly put in the\r\nvacant place, and to hear the jubilation on every hand.\r\n\r\nFor Rollitt was the fellow who had publicly insulted the Moderns in the\r\nperson of Dangle; and not only that, but--poor and shabby as he was--had\r\nshown himself utterly indifferent to their indignation and contemptuous\r\nof their threats.\r\n\r\n"Why," Dangle said, "the fellow\'s a pauper! he can\'t even pay for his\r\nclubs!  His father\'s a common fellow, I\'m told."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I heard," said Brinkman, "his fees up here are paid for him.\r\nWhy, we might just as well have Bob in the fifteen."\r\n\r\n"A jolly sight better.  Bob knows how to be civil."\r\n\r\n"It is a crime to be poor," said Fullerton.  "I hope I shall never\r\ncommit it."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Clapperton, ignoring this bit of sarcasm, "if he was well\r\nenough off to buy a cake of soap once a term, it wouldn\'t be so bad.  I\r\nbelieve when he wants a wash he goes down to Mrs Wisdom and borrows a\r\nbit of hers."\r\n\r\n"By the way, that reminds me," said Dangle; "did you fellows ever hear\r\nabout Mrs Wisdom\'s boat?  The lout had it out the other day in the\r\nrapids, and let it go over the falls, and it got smashed up."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed everybody.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean," said Brinkman, "poor Widow Wisdom has lost her boat owing\r\nto that cad?  Why, she\'ll be ruined?  However is she to get a new one?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the extraordinary thing," said Dangle.  "It was she told me\r\nabout it.  She says that Rollitt went straight away to the lake and\r\nbought her a boat that was for sale there; and she\'s got it now down in\r\nthe lower reach; and it\'s a better one than the other."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Clapperton, incredulously; "Rollitt bought a new boat!\r\nBosh!"\r\n\r\n"It was a second-hand one for sale cheap.  But it cost five pounds.  She\r\nshowed me the receipt."\r\n\r\n"Stuff and nonsense.  She was gammoning you," said Clapperton.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Dangle, snappishly; "you\'re not obliged to believe it\r\nunless you like."\r\n\r\nAnd there the conversation ended.\r\n\r\nThe day of the great match came at last.  The Rendlesham men, who had to\r\ncome from a distance, were not due till one o\'clock, and, as may be\r\nimagined, the interval was peculiarly trying to some of the inhabitants\r\nof Fellsgarth.  The farce of morning school was an ordeal alike to\r\nmasters and boys.  If gazing up at the clouds could bring down the rain,\r\na deluge should have fallen before 10 a.m.  As the hour approached the\r\nimpatience rose to fever heat.  It was the first match of the season.\r\nFor the last three years the two teams had met in deadly combat, and\r\neach time the match had ended in a draw, with not one goal kicked on\r\neither side.  Victory or defeat to-day would be a crisis in the history\r\nof Fellsgarth.  Woe betide the man who missed a point or blundered a\r\nkick!\r\n\r\nPercy and his friends put on flannels in honour of the occasion and\r\nsallied out an hour before the time to look at the ground and inspect\r\nthe new goal and flag posts which Fisher major, as the first act of his\r\ntreasurership, had ordered for the School.\r\n\r\nIt disgusted them somewhat to find that Wally and his friends--also in\r\nflannels--were on the spot before them, and, having surveyed the new\r\nacquisitions, had calmly bagged the four front central seats in the\r\npavilion reserved by courtesy for the head-master and his ladies.\r\n\r\nSince the tea at Mr Stratton\'s, the juniors had abated somewhat of\r\ntheir immemorial feud, although the relations were still occasionally\r\nsubject to tension.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, you kids," cried Wally, as his brother approached, "how do you\r\ndo?  Pretty well this morning?  That\'s right--so are we.  Have a seat?\r\nPlenty of room in the second row."\r\n\r\nConsidering that no one had yet put in an appearance, this was strictly\r\ncorrect.  Yet it did not please the Modern juniors.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get jolly well turned out when Ringwood comes," said Percy.\r\n"Come on, you chaps," added he to his own friends.  "What\'s the use of\r\nsitting on a bench like schoolboys an hour before the time?  Let\'s have\r\na trot."\r\n\r\n"Mind you don\'t dirty your white bags," cried D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"No, we might be mistaken for Classic kids if we did," shouted Cottle.\r\n"Ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nWhereupon, and not before time, the friends parted for a while.\r\n\r\nWhen Percy and Co. returned, they found the pavilion was filling up,\r\nand, greatly to their delight, the front row was empty.  The enemy had\r\nbeen cleared out; and serve them right.\r\n\r\n"Come on, you chaps," said Lickford; "don\'t let\'s get stuck in there.\r\nCome over to the oak tree, and get up there.  It\'s the best view in the\r\nfield."\r\n\r\nAlas! when they got to the oak tree, four friendly voices hailed them\r\nfrom among the leaves.\r\n\r\n"How are you, Modern kids?  There\'s a ripping view up here.  Have an\r\nacorn?  Mind your eye.  Sorry we\'re full up.  Plenty of room up the\r\npoplar tree."\r\n\r\nThe Moderns scorned to reply, and walked back sulkily to the pavilion,\r\nnot without parting greetings from their friends up the oak tree, and\r\nsquatted themselves on the steps.\r\n\r\nThe place was filling up now.  Mrs Stratton was there with some\r\nvisitors.  All the little Wakefields were there, of course--"minor,\r\nminimus, and minimissima," as they were called--uttering war-whoops in\r\nhonour of their house.  And there was a knot of Rendlesham fellows\r\ntalking among themselves and generally taking stock of the Fellsgarth\r\nform.  Mr Stratton, in civilian dress, as became the umpire, was the\r\nfirst representative of the School to show up on the grass.  A distant\r\ncheer from the top of the oak tree hailed his arrival, and louder cheers\r\nstill from the steps of the pavilion indicated that the popular master\r\nwas not the private property of any faction in Fellsgarth.\r\n\r\nTo Fisher minor it was amazing how Mr Stratton could talk and laugh as\r\npleasantly as he did with the umpire for the other side.  He felt sure\r\n_he_ could not have done it himself.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it occurred to Fisher minor, by what connection of ideas he\r\ncould not tell, what an awful thing it would be if Rollitt were to\r\nforget about the match.  The horror of the idea, which had all the\r\nweight of a presentiment, sent the colour from his cheeks, and without a\r\nword to anybody he slid down the tree and began to run with all his\r\nmight towards the school.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the row--collywobbles!" asked D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\nBut no one was in a position to answer.  A fusillade of acorns from the\r\ntree, and derisive compliments of "Well run!"  "Bravo, Short-legs!" from\r\nthe pavilion steps, greeted the runner as he passed that warm corner.\r\nHe didn\'t care.  Even the captain and his own brother, whom he met going\r\ndown to the field of battle, did not divert him.  He rushed panting up\r\nthe stairs and into Rollitt\'s study.\r\n\r\nRollitt was sitting at the table taking observations of a crumb of bread\r\nthrough a microscope.\r\n\r\n"Rollitt," gasped the boy, "the match!  It\'s just beginning, and you\r\npromised to play.  Do come, or we shall be licked!"\r\n\r\nRollitt took a further look at the crumb and then got up.\r\n\r\n"I forgot," said he; "come on, Fisher minor."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going to put on flannels?" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n"Why!" said Rollitt roughly, stalking out.\r\n\r\nFisher minor wondered if the reason was that he had none.  But he was\r\ntoo full of his mission to trouble about that, and, keeping his prize\r\nwell in sight, for fear he should go astray, had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing him arrive on the field of battle just as the opposing forces\r\nwere taking their places, and just as the Classic seniors were inwardly\r\ncalling themselves fools for having depended for a moment on a hopeless\r\nfellow of this sort.\r\n\r\nThe Classic juniors felt a good deal compromised by the champion\'s\r\nshabby cloth trousers and flannel shirt, but they cheered lustily all\r\nthe same, while the Moderns, having expressed their indignation to one\r\nanother, relieved their feelings by laughing.\r\n\r\nBut a moment after, everybody forgot everything but the match.\r\n\r\nThe Rendlesham men looked very trim and dangerous in their black and\r\nwhite uniform; and when presently their captain led off with a\r\nmagnificent place-kick which flew almost into the School lines, Classics\r\nand Moderns forgot their differences and squirmed with a common\r\nforeboding.  Fullerton promptly returned the ball into _medias res_, and\r\nthe usual inaugural scrimmage ensued.  To the knowing ones, who judged\r\nfrom little things, it seemed that the present match was likely to be as\r\neven as any of its predecessors.  The forwards were about equally\r\nweighted, and the quarter and half-backs who hovered outside seemed\r\nequally alert and light-footed.\r\n\r\nPresently the ball squeezed out on the School side and gave Ranger the\r\nfirst chance of a run.  He used it well, and with Fisher major and Yorke\r\non his flanks got well past the Rendlesham forwards amid loud cheers\r\nfrom the oak tree.  But the enemy\'s quarter-back pinned him in a moment;\r\nyet not before he had passed the ball neatly to Fisher on his left.\r\nFisher struggled on a few yards further with the captain and Dangle\r\nbacking up, but had to relinquish the ball to the former before he could\r\nreach the half-backs.  Yorke, always wary and cool-headed, had measured\r\nthe forces against him, and as soon as he had the ball, ran back a step\r\nor two, to break the ugly rush of two of the enemy who were nearest, and\r\nthen with a sweep distanced them, and charging through their half-backs\r\nmade a dash for the goal.  For a moment friend and foe held their\r\nbreath.  He looked like doing it.  But in his _detour_ he had given time\r\nfor Blackstone, the Rendlesham fast runner, to get under way and sweep\r\ndown to meet him just as he reeled out of the clutches of the half-\r\nbacks.  Next moment Yorke was down, and Dangle was not there to pick up\r\nthe ball.\r\n\r\nThis rush served pretty well to exhibit the strong and weak points of\r\neither side.  It was evident, for instance, that both Ranger and Yorke\r\nwere men to be marked by the other side, and that Dangle, on the\r\ncontrary, was playing slack.\r\n\r\nA series of scrimmages followed, in the midst of which the ball\r\ngravitated back to the centre of the field.  Runs were attempted on\r\neither side; once or twice the ball went out into touch, and once or\r\ntwice a drop-kick sent it flying over the forwards\' heads.  But it came\r\nback inevitably, so that after twenty minutes\' hard play it lay in\r\nalmost the identical spot from which it had first been kicked off.\r\n\r\nThe onlookers began to feel a little depressed.  It was not to be a\r\nwalk-over for the School, at any rate.  Indeed, it seemed doubtful\r\nwhether from the last and toughest of these scrimmages the ball would\r\never emerge again to the light of day.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however; it become evident that the _status quo_ was about to\r\ngive way, and that the fortunes of either side were going to take a new\r\nturn.  No one in the game, still less outside, could at first tell what\r\nhad happened.  Then it occurred to Yorke and one or two others that\r\nRollitt, who had hitherto been playing listlessly and sleepily, was\r\nwaking up.  His head, high above his fellows, was seen violently\r\nagitated in the middle of the scrimmage, and presently it struggled\r\nforward till it came to where the ball lay.  A moment later, the\r\nRendlesham side of the scrimmage showed signs of breaking, and a moment\r\nafter that Rollitt, quickly picking up the ball, burst through both\r\nfriend and foe.\r\n\r\n"Back up, Dangle! back up, Ranger!" shouted Yorke.\r\n\r\n"Look out behind!" cried the Rendlesham captain.\r\n\r\nRollitt carried that ball pretty much as he had carried Dangle a day or\r\ntwo before, almost contemptuously, indifferent as to who opposed him or\r\nwho got in his way.  The only difference was that whereas he then\r\nwalked, now he ran.  And when Rollitt chose to run, as Fellsgarth knew,\r\neven Ranger, the swift-footed, was not in it.\r\n\r\nThe enemy\'s forwards were shaken off, and their quarter-backs distanced.\r\nThe half-backs closed on him with a simultaneous charge that made him\r\nreel.  But he kept his feet better than they, and staggered on with one\r\nof them hanging to his arm.\r\n\r\n"Look out in goal!" shouted the Rendlesham men.\r\n\r\n"Back up, you fellows!" cried Yorke.\r\n\r\nIn his struggle with the man on his arm, Rollitt lost pace enough to\r\nenable Blackstone to overtake and make a wild dash, not at the man, but\r\nthe ball.  The onslaught was partly successful, for the ball fell.\r\nDangle, who was close behind, made an attempt to pick it up, but before\r\nhe could do so, Rollitt, like a hound momentarily checked, dashed back\r\nto recover it himself, knocking over, as he did so, both Dangle and\r\nBlackstone.\r\n\r\nHe had it again, and once more was off, this time with only the enemy\'s\r\nback to intercept him.  The back did his best, and sacrificed himself\r\nnobly for his side, but he was no match for the Fellsgarth giant, who\r\nsimply rode over him, and followed by a mighty roar of cheering from the\r\nonlookers, carried the ball behind the goals, touching it down with\r\nalmost fastidious precision exactly half-way between the poles.\r\n\r\nA minute later and Yorke, with one of his beautifully neat "places," had\r\nsent the ball spinning over the bar, as unmistakable a goal as the\r\nSchool had ever kicked.\r\n\r\nThe cheers which followed this exploit were completely lost on Rollitt,\r\nwho, having completed his run, dawdled back to his fellow-forwards, and\r\nhad not even the curiosity to watch the issue of the captain\'s kick.\r\n\r\nAs the sides changed ends, Dangle, with a black face, came up to him.\r\n\r\n"You knocked me over on purpose then, you cad, I could see it!" snarled\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n"Get out!" said Rollitt, shouldering the speaker aside.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Dangle.  Full of rage, he went to Yorke.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to stand this, Yorke.  Rollitt--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" said the captain.  "Spread out, you fellows, and be ready.\r\nGo to your place, Dangle."\r\n\r\nDangle sullenly obeyed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll let you see if I\'m to be insulted and made a fool of before all\r\nthe school," growled he.  "Catch me bothering myself any more."\r\n\r\nAs if to give him an opportunity of enforcing his protest, the kick-off\r\nof the losing side fell close at his feet.  He picked it up, and for a\r\nmoment the sporting instinct prompted him to make a rush.  But he caught\r\nsight of Yorke and Rollitt both looking his way, and the bad blood in\r\nhim prevailed.  He deliberately sent the ball with a little side-kick\r\ninto Blackstone\'s hands, who, running forward a step, sent it, with a\r\nmighty drop, right over the School line.  It almost grazed the goal post\r\nas it passed, and it was all Fullerton could do to save the touch-down\r\nbefore the whole advance guard of the enemy were upon him.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing had been so wilfully done that there was no mistaking\r\nits meaning.\r\n\r\n"Hold the ball!" cried Yorke, as the side ranged out for the kick-off.\r\n"Dangle, get off the field."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said Dangle, very white.\r\n\r\n"What I say.  You\'ll either do that or be kicked off."\r\n\r\nHere Clapperton interposed.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go, Dangle; he\'s no right to turn you off or talk to you like\r\nthat before the field because of an accident.  If you go, I\'ll go too."\r\n\r\n"Go, both of you, then," said Yorke.\r\n\r\nThe two Modern boys looked for a moment as though they doubted their own\r\nears.  What could Yorke mean, in the middle of a critical match like\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nHe evidently meant what he said.\r\n\r\n"Are you going or not?" said he.\r\n\r\nIt was a choice of evils.  To play now would be to surrender.  To stay\r\nwhere they were would render them liable to a kicking in the presence of\r\nall Fellsgarth.  They sullenly turned on their heels and walked behind\r\nthe goals.  Most of the spectators supposed it was a case of sprained\r\nankle or some such damage received in the cause of the School.  But the\r\nacute little birds who sat in the oak tree were not to be deceived, and\r\ntook good care to point the moral of the incident for the public\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n"Whiroo!  Cads!  Kicked out!  Serve \'em right!  Good riddance!  Play up,\r\nyou chaps!"\r\n\r\nThe chaps needed no encouragement.  With two men short it was next to\r\nimpossible to add to their present advantage.  But they contrived to\r\nstand their ground and save the School goal.  And when at last the\r\nwelcome "No side" was called, the cheers which greeted them proclaimed\r\nthat the School had won that day one of the biggest victories on its\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nTHE MODERNS ON STRIKE.\r\n\r\nIn the festivities with which the glorious victory of the School against\r\nRendlesham was celebrated Yorke took no part.\r\n\r\nThe captain was very decidedly down in the mouth.  This was the end of\r\nhis endeavour to administer rule with a perfectly even hand, and give no\r\nground for a whisper of anything like unfair play to the opposition!\r\nThis was what his popularity and authority were valued at!  For the\r\nfirst time in her annals, Fellsgarth fellows had mutinied on the field\r\nof battle and to their captain\'s face.\r\n\r\nHad it been Dangle only, it would have mattered less.  His feud with\r\nRollitt was notorious, and would account for any ebullition of bad\r\ntemper.  But when Clapperton not only patronised the mutiny but joined\r\nin it, things were come to a crisis which it required all Yorke\'s\r\ncourage and coolness to cope with.\r\n\r\nIt might have solaced him if he could have heard a discussion which was\r\ntaking place in the rebels\' quarters.\r\n\r\n"It served them precious well right," said Clapperton, trying to justify\r\nwhat, to say the least of it, wanted some excuse.  "We\'d stood it long\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"It\'s bad enough," said Dangle, "to have the fifteen packed with Classic\r\nfellows; but when they take to attacking us before the whole field, it\'s\r\ntime something was done.  I\'m as certain as possible that Rollitt\r\ndeliberately knocked me over that time."\r\n\r\n"It was rather warm measures, though," said Brinkman, "to walk off the\r\nfield.  We might have got licked."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not at all sure if it wouldn\'t have been a very good thing if we\r\nhad," said Clapperton.  "At any rate, it will be a lesson to them what\r\nit might come to."\r\n\r\n"Nothing like scuttling a ship in mid-ocean if you want to be attended\r\nto.  The only awkward thing is, you are apt to go down with it," said\r\nFullerton.\r\n\r\n"Do shut up, and don\'t try to be funny," said Clapperton.  "Of course no\r\none wants to wreck the clubs.  We shall play up hard next time, and then\r\nthey\'ll see it\'s worth their while to be civil to us."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Brinkman, "it won\'t do to let them say we aren\'t the friends\r\nof the School."\r\n\r\n"There\'s not the least fear of any one thinking that now," gibed\r\nFullerton.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Dangle, "as we are to play the return with Rendlesham this\r\nday week, we shall have a chance of letting them see what we can do.\r\nOnly if that cad Rollitt plays, it won\'t be easy to be civil."\r\n\r\nThese patriotic young gentlemen were a good deal disconcerted next\r\nmorning to find that they had been reckoning without their host.  The\r\ncaptain had posted up the fifteen to play next week.  The list contained\r\nthe names of Fullerton, Brinkman, and two others on the Modern side, but\r\nomitted those of Clapperton and Dangle.\r\n\r\nIn their wildest dreams the malcontents had never reckoned on the\r\ncaptain taking such a step as this.  They knew that they were necessary\r\nto the efficiency of any team, and that without them, especially against\r\nRendlesham, it would be almost a farce to go into the field at all.\r\n\r\nAt first they were disposed to laugh and sneer; then to bluster.  Then\r\nit dawned on them gradually that for once in their lives they had made a\r\nmistake.  They had not even the credit of refusing to play, but had been\r\nignominiously kicked out.\r\n\r\nA council of war was held, in which mutual recriminations, assisted by\r\nFullerton\'s candid reflections on the situation, occupied a considerable\r\nshare of the time.\r\n\r\nThe result of their deliberations was that Clapperton and Dangle went\r\nover in no very amiable frame of mind to the captain.\r\n\r\nYorke, as it happened, was having an uneasy conference with his own side\r\nat the time.  Delighted as the Classics were at the blow which had been\r\nstruck at the mutineers, the prospect of almost certain defeat next\r\nSaturday made them anxious for compromise.\r\n\r\n"If I were you," said Fisher major, "I\'d give them a chance of\r\nexplaining and apologising."\r\n\r\n"There can be no apology," said Yorke.\r\n\r\n"You are quite right in theory," said Denton; "but wouldn\'t it be rather\r\na crow for them to see that we are licked without them?"\r\n\r\n"We mustn\'t be licked," said the captain.  "We held our own without them\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but we were on our own ground, and had a goal to the good before\r\nthey struck."\r\n\r\n"I think old Yorke is quite right," said Ranger.  "We may be licked, and\r\nif we are they\'ll crow.  On the other hand, if we let them play now\r\nthey\'ll crow worse.  I think we\'d better be beaten by Rendlesham than by\r\ntraitors."\r\n\r\n"Shan\'t you let them play at all this half?" said Fisher.\r\n\r\n"That depends on themselves," said Yorke.\r\n\r\n"Hullo! here they come," said Ranger.\r\n\r\nThe two Moderns were a little disconcerted to find themselves confronted\r\nwith the body of Classic seniors.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re engaged," said Clapperton; "we\'ll come again."\r\n\r\n"No, we were talking about the team; I suppose that\'s what you\'ve come\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Clapperton; "we want to know what it means!"\r\n\r\n"Really I don\'t see how it could have been put plainer.  It means that\r\nthe fifteen men named are going to play on Saturday."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Yorke," said Clapperton, "if you think I\'ve come over here\r\nto beg you to put Dangle and me into the team, you\'re mistaken--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it.  You know it\'s impossible."\r\n\r\n"All I can say is, it\'s sheer spite and nothing else.  Dangle was\r\ndeliberately knocked over by that cad Rollitt--"\r\n\r\n"Who is not present, and may therefore be called names with safety,"\r\nsaid Ranger.\r\n\r\n"Shut up, Ranger, there\'s a good fellow," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"And Dangle had a right to object," continued Clapperton.\r\n\r\n"He had no right to play into the hands of the other side," said Yorke.\r\n\r\n"How do you know I did?" said Dangle.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say you didn\'t?" said Yorke.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t come here to be catechised by you.  Are you going to put\r\nClapperton and me in the fifteen or not?  That\'s what we came to know."\r\n\r\n"No--certainly not," said the captain; "and as that\'s all, you may as\r\nwell go."\r\n\r\n"Very well," sneered Clapperton, who was in a high temper, "you\'ll be\r\nsorry for it.  Come on, Dangle."\r\n\r\n"There\'s only one thing to be done now," said he, when they had got back\r\nto their own side; "we must none of us play.  That will bring them to\r\nreason."\r\n\r\nBrinkman approved of the idea.\r\n\r\n"There\'s more sense in that," said he, "than you two sticking out.  That\r\nwill reduce the team to a Classic fifteen, and if they get licked it\r\nwon\'t matter."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no possible chance of their making up a fifteen without us?"\r\nasked Dangle.\r\n\r\n"None at all.  They haven\'t the men," said Clapperton, brightening up.\r\n"The fact is, we have them at our mercy; and if they want us to play\r\nagain they\'ll have to ask us properly."\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile Fellsgarth will get on splendidly," said Fullerton.\r\n\r\n"Shut up.  Don\'t you see it will be all the better for everybody in the\r\nlong run?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say I do at present.  It may come by and by--"\r\n\r\n"We must see that everybody backs up in this," said Brinkman.  "One\r\ntraitor would spoil everything."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what Yorke said on Saturday, wasn\'t it?" asked Fullerton\r\ninnocently, "At least, he said two traitors.  Yorke will not see that\r\nwhat\'s right for one fellow is naughty for another."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Fullerton," said Clapperton, who was sensitive enough to\r\nfeel the sting of all this, "you don\'t suppose we\'re doing this for fun,\r\ndo you?  Will you promise not to play on Saturday, even if you are\r\nasked?"\r\n\r\n"What if I don\'t?" said Fullerton.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t find it particularly comfortable on this side of the School,\r\nthat\'s all," said Brinkman.\r\n\r\nFullerton meditated and turned the matter over.\r\n\r\n"I think on the whole," said he, mimicking Clapperton, "that as this is\r\nfor the highest good of the School, and as everybody is to be all the\r\nbetter in the long run, and as we\'re all going to be noble and sacrifice\r\nourselves together, you may put me down as not playing on Saturday.\r\n_Dulce et decorum est pro patria_--I beg pardon, I\'m not on the Classic\r\nside yet."\r\n\r\nThe other players named on the list consented more or less reluctantly\r\nto follow the same example.  After morning school, therefore, when the\r\nfellows looked at the notice board, they saw, to their bewilderment, the\r\nnames of the four Modern fellows struck out and the following note\r\nappended to the captain\'s list--\r\n\r\n"Notice.\r\n\r\n"The following players protest against the exclusion of two names from\r\nthe above list, and decline to play on Saturday, viz., Brinkman,\r\nFullerton, Ramshaw major, and Smith."\r\n\r\nUnderneath this, a juvenile hand had carefully inscribed in bold\r\ncharacters--\r\n\r\n"Jolly good riddance of bad rubbish."  Signed, "Wheatfield, W., D\'Arcy,\r\nAshby, Fisher minor."\r\n\r\nFisher minor, who signed this latter manifesto by proxy had hastened to\r\ncarry the news of it to his brother.\r\n\r\n"The cads!" said the junior.  "We are sure to be beaten; I shall never\r\ndare to get Rollitt twice running."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked the elder brother, turning round.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t tell," said Fisher minor, "I didn\'t mean to say anything; you\r\nsee, I thought he wouldn\'t fly out, so I asked him last time."\r\n\r\n"You!  What do you know of Rollitt?  Why should he play to oblige you?"\r\n\r\nFisher minor, wishing he had not mentioned Rollitt\'s name, related,\r\nsomewhat apologetically, the story of the adventure on the Shayle.\r\n\r\n"Why," said the elder brother, "you saved his life, young \'un.  No\r\nwonder he\'s civil to you!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, please don\'t tell him I told you."\r\n\r\n"All right; but what about the boat?  It must have been smashed to bits.\r\nWhat did Mrs Wisdom say?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Rollitt was very honourable and bought her another.  She told me\r\nso--and I\'ve seen the new boat."\r\n\r\n"Rollitt bought it!  Why, he\'s as poor as a church mouse.  How could he\r\nget the money, I\'d like to know?"\r\n\r\n"He got it the very next day," said Fisher minor.  "I suppose he had\r\nsome; but promise you won\'t say anything."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of making a secret of it?  I won\'t say anything unless\r\nyou like.  But I must go to Yorke."\r\n\r\nThe captain was quite prepared for the action of the Moderns.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve struck," said he.  "Now the question is, shall we play on\r\nSaturday, or scratch the match?"\r\n\r\nThe unanimous verdict was in favour of playing, whatever the result.\r\n\r\n"Of course we are never sure of Rollitt until we\'ve got him," said he,\r\n"so we may have to play without him."\r\n\r\n"Would Stratton play for us?" asked some one.\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t let\'s go outside and ask masters.  We\'re in for a licking;\r\nbut we\'ll make the best fight we can."\r\n\r\nSo yet another notice appeared on the board before nightfall.\r\n\r\n"The School team on Saturday will consist of the following."  (Here\r\nfollowed the names, all, of course, on the Classical side.)\r\n\r\n"A meeting of the clubs is summoned for October 3, at four p.m., in\r\nHall."\r\n\r\nOf these two announcements the first amused, the second perplexed the\r\ngood young men of the Modern side.  The new fifteen consisted half of\r\nraw outsiders who had never played in a first-class match before, and\r\nwere utterly unknown to fame on the football field.  But the summons for\r\nOctober 3 was puzzling.  Did it mean a general row, or was the captain\r\ngoing to resign, or was an attempt to be made to expel the mutineers?\r\n\r\nClapperton did not like it.  He had expected Yorke would have come to\r\nterms before now, and it disconcerted him to see that, on the contrary,\r\nthe captain seemed determined to carry the thing through.\r\n\r\nThe only thing, of course, was for the Moderns to abstain in a body from\r\nthe meeting.  But could they depend on their forces to obey their\r\nleaders?  It was all very well to compel four players to refuse to act;\r\nbut to constrain 120 boys to do the same was a less easy task.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Clapperton that he would do best to strike the iron while\r\nhot; and for that purpose he made a descent next morning into the\r\nquarters of his fag.  If he could secure the juniors, it would be\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nHe found Percy there alone, diligently working.  That young gentleman\r\nhad in fact been reminded in pretty forcible terms by Mr Forder that he\r\nhad not yet handed in his Latin letter of apology ordered a week ago.\r\nPercy had hoped if he forgot it long enough Mr Forder would forget it\r\ntoo, and it had startled and grieved him very much to-day to receive\r\nnotice that unless he brought his _poena_ in an hour he would be sent up\r\nto the doctor.\r\n\r\nConsequently, while his comrades were out enjoying themselves, he was\r\nhere in a shocking bad temper, with a Latin Dictionary in front of him,\r\ntrying to express his contrition for having used bad language in class a\r\nweek ago.\r\n\r\nHe had got a little way.  Latin prose for a Modern junior is a trifle\r\nthorny; but Percy had a rough and ready way with him which, if it did\r\nnot emulate Cicero, at least made his meaning tolerably clear.\r\n\r\n"Care Magistere Fordere, Ego sum excessive tristis ut ego usebam malam\r\nlinguam in classem alteram diem.  Ego apologizo, et ego non facerebo\r\nillud iterum.  Ego spero ut vos voluntas prodonnere," (it took him some\r\ntime to arrive at this classical term for "you will forgive") "me hanc\r\ntempus."\r\n\r\nThis was all very well, but it only took up about six lines out of ten,\r\nand he was in despair how to continue.  His ideas, his temper, and his\r\nLatin had all evaporated.  When Clapperton entered, he did not even look\r\nup.\r\n\r\n"Cut, whoever you are, and hang yourself," said he.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Percy!  What\'s the row with you?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk to me," said Percy.  "It\'s that beast Forder."\r\n\r\n"Where are the others?  I want to talk to you youngsters."\r\n\r\n"How do I know where every ass in the place is?  What do you want?"\r\n\r\nThe tone in which the inquiry was made was not encouraging.\r\n\r\n"It\'s about the meeting next week.  We don\'t mean to attend it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you?  Our lot does.  We\'re going.  Rather."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a dodge of the other side.  They\'re going to get the clubs into\r\ntheir own hands, and we\'ve decided none of our fellows shall go.  Then\r\nthey can\'t do anything."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t they?  You don\'t know my young brother Wally as well as I do.\r\nHe\'ll do something, bless you; but I rather fancy they won\'t have it all\r\nto themselves.  _We\'ll_ put a spoke in their wheels."\r\n\r\n"Look here, young Wheatfield," said Clapperton, put out by the\r\nobtuseness of his fag, "the long and short of it is you\'re not to go.\r\nYou know what\'s happened.  Our side has been snubbed and cut out of the\r\ngames by those fellows; and now they want to get us to come to their\r\nprecious meeting to help them collar the clubs."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just why I and my chaps are going to turn up," said Percy.\r\n"We\'ll let them know!"\r\n\r\n"Do you hear what I say?  You\'re not to go, you or any of them.  If you\r\ncan\'t understand the reason, I dare say you\'ll understand a thrashing.\r\nYou\'ll get it unless you stand out like the rest of us."\r\n\r\n"I say, what\'s the Latin for `wrong,\' Clapperton?"\r\n\r\n"Do you hear what I say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--is it `malus,\' or `unrectus,\' or what?"\r\n\r\n"Are you going to do what I tell you?"\r\n\r\n"How can I say what the chaps\'ll do?"\r\n\r\n"You must tell them; you\'re fags\' captain.  They must do what you tell\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"I\'d jolly well like to catch them not," said Percy, tossing his head:\r\n"I\'d teach \'em.  I say, do you think `unrectus\' will do?"\r\n\r\n"Remember, you\'ll get it pretty hot if you disobey in this, I promise\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps `malus\' is better form," suggested the junior.\r\n\r\nClapperton left in despair.\r\n\r\n"What a fearful ass I was," said Percy when he had gone, "not to make\r\nhim write my impot!  Just like me.  Catch our lot not going to that\r\nmeeting!  We aint going to skulk.  Whew! there goes the quarter to!  I\r\nshall never get done this brutal thing."\r\n\r\n"Id est malus non facere quad magister dicit.  Vos voluntas laetus\r\naudire ut Fellsgarthus liquebat Rendleshamus ad pedemballum super\r\nSaturdaium durare," (Saturday last).  "Nos obtenebanus unum goalum ad\r\nnil quod non erat malum.  Ego debeo nunc concludere.  Ego sum vestrum\r\nfideliter Perceius Granum agrum."  (Percy flattered himself he knew the\r\ncorrect Latin for his own name.)\r\n\r\nHe had a rush to get this work of art over to Mr Forder in time, and\r\nwas considerably mortified to observe that the master did not seem at\r\nall gratified by the performance.  Just like Forder! the more you laid\r\nyourself out to please him, the worse he was.\r\n\r\n"Leave it, sir.  I\'ll speak to you to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"That means a licking," said Percy to himself.  "I can see it in his\r\neye.  All serene.  That\'s his way of showing his gratitude."\r\n\r\nAnd he went back in a very bad temper to his own room, where his\r\ncomrades had arrived to greet him.\r\n\r\n"Why ever can\'t you chaps be in the way when you\'re wanted?" prowled\r\nPercy.  "There was Clapperton in here just now talking rot about the\r\nmeeting next week.  What do you think?  He says we\'re not to go to it."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\nPercy in his lucid manner tried to explain.\r\n\r\n"All gammon," said Lickford.  "If we\'re to be stopped going to Hall, we\r\nshall be stopped grub next."\r\n\r\nThis was an argument that went home.\r\n\r\n"If Clapperton had made it worth our while, you know," said Cottle, "it\r\nmight have been different.  I don\'t care much about the meeting; but if\r\nI stop away for him, I\'ll get something for it."\r\n\r\nThis mercenary view of the subject was new to Percy, but he frankly\r\naccepted it.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said he; "here, give us a pen; we\'ll just draw up a\r\nfew conditions.  If he accepts them we\'ll stay away; if he don\'t, he may\r\nhang himself before we sit out."\r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation, the following charter of six points was drawn\r\nup and laid on Clapperton\'s table.\r\n\r\n"On the following conditions the undersigned will stop out of Hall on\r\nOctober 3,--namely, to wit, viz., i.e.:--\r\n\r\n"1.  No more fagging.\r\n\r\n"2.  Don\'t go to bed till 9:30.\r\n\r\n"3.  A study a-piece.\r\n\r\n"4.  The prefects shall be abolished.  Any prefect reporting to Forder\r\nto be kicked.\r\n\r\n"5.  Except between 9:30 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. we do as we like.\r\n\r\n"6.  That the four following Classic cads get their noses pulled; namely\r\nWheatfield, W., D\'Arcy, Ashby, and Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"If these are agreed to, we won\'t go to the meeting."\r\n\r\n  (Signed by) Wheatfield, P., M.P.\r\n  Cottle, Major-General.\r\n  Lickford, D.D.\r\n  Ramshaw minor, F.S.A.\r\n  Cash, LL.D., etcetera, etcetera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nCORDER TO THE FRONT.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the return match with Rendlesham was damp and muggy, and\r\nso assorted well with the spirits of Fellsgarth generally.\r\n\r\nThe juniors of course were cheerful--everything came in the day\'s work\r\nfor them--but among the seniors on either side gloom prevailed.  Even\r\nRanger, the lighthearted, was snappish, as his fag discovered; and\r\nDenton, the amiable, hoped he would not, for his temper\'s sake, meet too\r\nmany Moderns between morning and evening.  The captain, though he kept\r\nup his usual show of serenity, was evidently worried.  But he had no\r\nnotion of giving in.  No!  If the School was to be thrashed let them\r\ntake their thrashing like men, and not whine about like the "other\r\nboys."\r\n\r\n"After all," said he to Ranger, "we may not get glory, but we needn\'t\r\nlose it.  Only, for goodness\' sake, let us keep our rows to ourselves,\r\nand not talk about them out of doors."\r\n\r\n"Right you are!" said his friend.  "I wish I had your temper.  The cads!\r\nAnd after the way you\'ve treated them, too.  Why, some of us thought\r\nyou went out of your way to favour them."\r\n\r\nThe captain grunted, and began to throw his flannels into his bag.\r\n\r\n"What about Rollitt?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No go.  He\'s gone off for a day\'s fishing."\r\n\r\nThe captain whistled dismally.  "Then we must play a man short.  There\'s\r\nno one else worth putting in.  It\'s like marching to one\'s execution,"\r\nhe said; "I wish it was all over.  But it\'s only just beginning."\r\n\r\nThe Moderns were gloomy too.  They had taken their course, and they must\r\nstand by it now.  When they came to reflect, it was not a particularly\r\nglorious one, nor did it seem to promise much by way of compensation.\r\nThey were done out of football for the rest of the term; they were\r\nreduced to a faction in Fellsgarth, and what was worse, they were\r\nsecretly doubtful whether they were quite as much in the right as they\r\ntried to persuade themselves.\r\n\r\nThey had taken their course, however, and must go on.\r\n\r\n"I suppose none of our side will go on the omnibus," said Brinkman.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said Clapperton.  "It will do them good to have spectators.\r\nI shall go; not that I care about it, but just to assert my rights."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah for self-sacrifice!" said Fullerton.  "If your principles will\r\nallow you to take chicken and tongue sandwiches with you, I\'ll go too."\r\n\r\n"It\'s ten to one they\'ll try to prevent our going," said Dangle; "I hope\r\nthey\'ll try."\r\n\r\nWhen the two coaches drove up to carry the fifteen and the prefects and\r\nother privileged boys to the scene of conflict, a good deal of surprise\r\nwas evinced at the appearance of Clapperton, Brinkman, Dangle, and\r\nFullerton, in ordinary costume, and without bags, ready to accompany the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nContrary to their expectations and hopes, no protest was made, and, as\r\nfar as the Classic seniors were concerned, no notice was vouchsafed\r\nthem.  This was annoying, particularly as the juniors present took care\r\nto call attention to their presence.\r\n\r\n"Look at \'em," cried Wally; "don\'t they look clever?"\r\n\r\n"Kicked out of the team--serve \'em right!" shouted Ashby.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s kicked out?" retorted the Modern fags.  "It would take better\r\nchaps than you to kick them out."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you wish you could kick them in?  They know better," retorted\r\nPercy and Co.\r\n\r\nAmid such embarrassing comments, the four Modern heroes mounted to their\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe cheers of their adherents hardly made up for the chilly welcome of\r\ntheir travelling companions.  Yorke, seeing Clapperton looking for a\r\nplace, politely moved up to make room, and then turned his back and\r\ntalked to Ranger.  The other three were similarly cut off, Dangle\r\nfinding himself in between Fisher major and Denton, who talked across\r\nhim.  Brinkman, on another coach, was tucked in among some rowdy Classic\r\nmiddle-boys who were discussing the "strike" very vigorously among\r\nthemselves.  As for Fullerton, he was lucky enough to get the seat\r\nbeside the driver, where, at any rate, he could count on one sympathetic\r\nsoul into whose ears to pour his occasional words of wisdom.\r\n\r\nJust as the first coach was starting, a shout was heard from across the\r\nGreen, and Corder, the Modern boy whose services were declined on the\r\nprevious occasion, equipped in an ulster and with his bag in his hand,\r\nappeared signalling for the _cortege_ to wait.\r\n\r\n"Well! what is it?" demanded Dangle.\r\n\r\n"Is Yorke there?  Yorke, can I play to-day?"\r\n\r\n"No, you can\'t," said Dangle in a menacing undertone.  "None of us are\r\nplaying; you know that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why I mayn\'t play if I have the chance," said Corder.  "I\r\nawfully want to play in the fifteen."\r\n\r\n"We\'re a man short," said Yorke.  "You can play, Corder."\r\n\r\n"If you dare to come and play," said Dangle, still in a whisper, "you\'ll\r\nfind it so precious hot for yourself afterwards that you\'ll be sorry for\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Yorke says I may play," persisted Corder; "I don\'t see why I\r\nshouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Cad! traitor! blackleg!" yelled Percy and Co., as they saw their man\r\nmount the coach.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! got _one_ man among you who isn\'t a coward and a sneak, and--\r\nand a howling kid!" retorted Wally.  "Gee up!"  Whereat the whips\r\ncracked and the happy party drove off.\r\n\r\nCorder was one of those obtuse youths who can never take in more than\r\none idea at a time.  His present idea was football.  He had come up this\r\nterm with a consuming ambition to get into the fifteen, and had played\r\nhard and desperately to secure his end.  Last week, when Brinkman was\r\nobliged to retire, he thought his chance was come, and great was his\r\nmortification when he found that his nomination was not accepted by the\r\ncaptain.  Still he didn\'t despair.  When he saw the vacancies caused in\r\nthe team by the defection of the Moderns, his hopes rose again; but once\r\nmore they were dashed by the captain\'s announcement of a fifteen made up\r\nwholly of Classics.\r\n\r\nTo-day he had not had the heart to come out and see the coaches start,\r\nand was moping in his own room, when some one brought in word that\r\nRollitt was not going to play after all, and that the team was setting\r\nout a man short.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Corder dashed into his ulster, flung his flannels into his\r\nbag, and tore out of his house just in time to secure for himself the\r\nlong-coveted honour, and find himself in the glorious position of\r\n"playing for the School."\r\n\r\nHow was such a fellow likely to trouble his head about strikes, and\r\nprotests, and organised desertion?\r\n\r\nFortunately for the comfort of his journey, he had to pack himself away\r\non the floor between the feet of Ridgway and another of the team, who,\r\nif they kicked him at all, only did it by accident or by way of\r\nencouragement, and not as Dangle or Brinkman might have done, in spite.\r\n\r\nThe rain was coming down pretty steadily by the time the party got to\r\ntheir destination, and the gloom on the brows of the four Modern\r\nprefects deepened as they looked up and speculated on the delights of\r\nstanding for an hour on the wet grass watching their rivals play.\r\n\r\n"Dangle," said Clapperton, "we must stop that cad Corder\'s playing at\r\nall cost.  It will upset everything.  Come and talk to him."\r\n\r\nBut Corder, perhaps with an inkling of what was in store for him, had\r\nentrenched himself behind a number of other players, and in close\r\nproximity to Ranger, who had evidently told himself off to see that the\r\nlast recruit of the fifteen was not tampered with.\r\n\r\nThe signals of the two seniors were studiously not observed, and when\r\nDangle, getting desperate, said--\r\n\r\n"Corder, half a minute; Clapperton wants you."  Ranger interposed with--\r\n\r\n"Come on, you fellows, it\'s time we got into our flannels," and\r\neffectually checkmated the manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n"If he doesn\'t get paid out for this," growled Clapperton, "I\'m precious\r\nmistaken."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and the other fellows must see that he is.  If this sort of thing\r\nspreads, we may as well cave in at once."\r\n\r\nThe Rendlesham fellows hovered about under shelter till the last moment,\r\ngrumbling at the weather, the grass, and the dock.  At length the\r\nFellsgarth boys put in an appearance; sides were solemnly tossed for,\r\nand the order to "spread out" was given.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" said one of the Rendlesham men as he passed Clapperton and\r\nDangle, "why aren\'t you playing?  Afraid of the cold?"\r\n\r\n"No, we scratched because--"\r\n\r\n"Have you got that big man down who was so hot in the scrimmages?  I\r\nforget his name.  _He\'s_ not one of the delicate ones, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"No more are we; we\'re not playing because--"\r\n\r\n"Hullo! they\'re waiting," said the player, and went off, leaving the\r\nexplanation still unfinished.\r\n\r\nOne of the last to run out was Corder.\r\n\r\n"You young cad," growled Clapperton as he passed; "take my advice and\r\ndon\'t play, unless--"\r\n\r\n"Come on, Corder--waiting," shouted Yorke.\r\n\r\nCorder obeyed like lightning.\r\n\r\nThe match began disastrously for Fellsgarth.  Within five minutes of the\r\nkick-off, a run up by one of the Rendlesham quarter-backs carried the\r\nball right into the School lines, and a touch-down resulted.  On a fine\r\nday like last Saturday a goal would have been certain, but on the wet\r\ngrass, the try did not come off.  But five minutes later, a drop-kick\r\nfrom the middle of the field by the Rendlesham captain secured a\r\nmagnificent goal for the home team.\r\n\r\nClapperton sneered.\r\n\r\n"What I expected," said he.  "They\'ll be lucky if they don\'t lose a\r\ndozen."\r\n\r\nYorke, on the contrary, was cheering up.  Bad as these opening ten\r\nminutes had been, he fancied his team was not going to do so badly after\r\nall.  The new players were working like mad in the scrimmage.  Ranger\r\nwas as quick on his feet in the wet as in the dry; and Corder at half-\r\nback had been surprisingly steady.\r\n\r\nBefore kicking off again he made one or two changes.  He moved Ridgway,\r\nwho was a heavy weight, up into the forwards.  Corder, greatly to his\r\ndelight, was entrusted with the goal, and Fisher major moved up to half-\r\nback.  The forwards were ordered on no account to break loose, but if\r\nnecessary to keep the ball among them till time was called.\r\n\r\nThen, with his well-known "On you go!" he lacked off.\r\n\r\nThe ball was almost immediately locked up in a tight, fierce scrimmage.\r\nThe boys took the captain\'s advice with a vengeance, and held the ball\r\namong their feet doggedly, neither letting it through on their side, nor\r\nforcing it out on the side of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, it could be seen filtering out sideways, just where\r\nthe captain was hovering outside the scrimmage.\r\n\r\n"Let it come!" he whispered.  "Look out, Ranger!"\r\n\r\nNext moment the ball was under his arm, and before any one realised that\r\nthe scrimmage was up, he was off with it and among the enemy\'s half-\r\nbacks.  The half-backs knew Yorke of old, and closed upon him before he\r\ncould double or get round them.\r\n\r\n"Pass!" shouted Ranger.\r\n\r\nIt was beautifully done, while Yorke was falling and Ranger brushing\r\npast.  The enemy\'s half-backs were not in it with the fleet Fellsgarth\r\nrunner, nor was their back; and to their own utter amazement, three\r\nminutes later the School placed to their credit an easy goal.\r\n\r\nThen did Clapperton and Dangle and Brinkman gnash their teeth till they\r\nached, and Fullerton, standing near, had his gibe.\r\n\r\n"It was worth coming here in the rain to see that, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe match was not yet over.  The Rendlesham men, startled into attention\r\nby this unexpected rebuff, took care that such a misadventure should not\r\nhappen again, and making all the use they could of their superior\r\nweight, bore down the scrimmages and forced the ball into the open.\r\nOnce they carried it through with a splendid rush, and their captain\r\npicking it up under the very feet of the boys, ran it forward a few\r\nyards, and took a drop-kick which missed by only a few inches.\r\n\r\nA little later came Corder\'s chance.  He had lived all the term for this\r\nmoment.  If he was taken back to Fellsgarth on a shutter he would not\r\ncare, so long as he did himself credit now.\r\n\r\nHe had a clear field to start with, and was well out of touch before the\r\nadvance guard of the enemy bore down on him.  Then it was a sight to see\r\nhim wriggle and dodge, and twist and turn in and out among them,\r\nthreading them like a needle through a string of beads, and slipping\r\nthrough their hands like an eel.\r\n\r\n"Well played indeed, Corder!" cried Yorke.\r\n\r\nOh, what music was in the sound!  What would he not dare now!\r\n\r\nOn he went, now diving under an arm, now staggering round a leg; now\r\njumping like a kangaroo against an opponent.  The very sight of his\r\nevolutions seemed to demoralise the Rendlesham men.  They floundered and\r\nslid on the slippery grass, and made wild grabs without ever reaching\r\nhim.  It was really too ridiculous to be eluded by a raw hand like\r\nthis--and yet he eluded them.\r\n\r\nHalf-way down the field he ran with a roar of applause at his back, and\r\nonly a handful of the enemy left ahead.  How splendid if he could only\r\npass them, and make his record with a run from one goal to the other!\r\n\r\nAlas! a swoop from behind greeted the proud thought; two hands clawed at\r\nhis shoulders, and from his shoulders slipped to his waist, and from his\r\nwaist slid down to his ankles, where for a moment they held, and sent\r\nthe runner tripping over on his nose in the mud, with the ball spinning\r\naway a yard ahead.\r\n\r\nIt was all up.  No!  Fisher was on the spot, and at Fisher\'s heels\r\nRidgway.  The Rendlesham backs flung themselves in the way, but only to\r\ndivert, not to stop their career.  When Corder picked himself up and\r\nrubbed the mud out of his eyes, the first thing he saw was Ridgway\r\nsitting behind the enemy\'s line with the ball comfortably resting on his\r\nknee!  It was another for the School--perhaps a goal.\r\n\r\nAlas! on that ground the long side-kick was too much even for Yorke.  It\r\nshot wide, and Rendlesham breathed again.\r\n\r\nBut the long and short of it was that the match was a tie; a goal and a\r\ntry to each side; and that to Corder belonged the credit of a big hand\r\nin the lesser point.\r\n\r\n"Awfully well run, Corder," said the captain, as, time having been\r\ncalled, the two walked off the field together.  "You must play for us\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nAfter that, who should say life was not worth living?\r\n\r\nThe very weather seemed to change for Corder.  The sun came out, flowers\r\nsprang up at his feet, birds started singing in the trees overhead.\r\nWhat a letter he would have to write home to-morrow!  The captain\'s pat\r\non the back sent a glow all through him.  Who wouldn\'t be a Fellsgarth\r\nchap after all?\r\n\r\nIt scarcely damped his joy to perceive that neither Clapperton, Dangle,\r\nnor Brinkman shared in the general congratulations, but looked more\r\nblack and threatening than ever as he passed.  Pooh! what did he care\r\nfor that!\r\n\r\nHow he enjoyed the glorious Rendlesham high tea, and the drive home in\r\nthe rain with everybody talking and laughing and rejoicing, singing\r\nsongs and shouting war-cries!  He was quite sorry when it came to an\r\nend, and he had to dismount and go over alone to his own house.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the shouts and huzzas of the Classics across the Green as\r\nWakefield\'s turned out in a body to welcome their men.  No one at\r\nForder\'s turned out to welcome him.  The four prefects themselves had\r\nnot even waited for him.\r\n\r\nFor the first time that day Corder felt himself wishing he had a little\r\nsympathy in his jubilation.  It was dull, when everybody over on the\r\nother side was shouting himself hoarse, to hear not a "cheep" of\r\ncongratulation from his own fellows.\r\n\r\nHowever, it didn\'t matter much.  He went to his room and changed, and\r\nhoped his messmate Wilson would not be long in coming for supper and a\r\ngossip.\r\n\r\nWilson came presently, but his face was glum and his manner frigid.\r\n\r\n"Oh, here you are, old chap; I\'m peckish.  Did you hear about the match,\r\nwe--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up," said Wilson; "you\'re a cad.  I don\'t want to talk to you."\r\n\r\nCorder put down his knife and fork, and looked up in amazement.  This\r\nfrom Wilson!  He knew Clapperton was sore about it, but Wilson--\r\n\r\nHe went on eating while thinking it out, and Wilson ate too in silence,\r\nand then rose to go.\r\n\r\n"Are you not going to prepare to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in Dangle\'s room."\r\n\r\nAnd Corder was left alone.\r\n\r\nThis was too bad of Wilson--to-night of all nights.  He would go and\r\nlook up Selby.  Selby, he knew, would be interested in the day\'s news,\r\nfor had they not practised drop-kicks together for an hour a day all\r\nthis term?\r\n\r\nSelby was in, but not at all glad to see him.\r\n\r\n"Are you busy, old man?" asked Corder.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you here," said Selby.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the row?"\r\n\r\n"Row?  You\'re a sneak, that\'s the row.  Cut!"\r\n\r\nSurely Selby must be out of sorts to talk like that.  Corder stood in\r\nthe door for a moment, on the off-chance that his friend might be\r\njoking.  But no; Selby turned his back and began to read a book.\r\n\r\nThis was getting monotonous.  Corder returned to his study to think it\r\nout a little more.  His fag, Cash, was there looking for a paper.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, youngster! that you?  We didn\'t get beaten after all, to-day, I\r\nsuppose you heard."\r\n\r\nCash\'s reply was laconic, to say the least of it.  He turned round and\r\nput out his tongue.\r\n\r\n"None of your cheek, I say," said Corder, "or I\'ll--"\r\n\r\n"How _dare_ you speak to me!" said the junior; "you\'re a cad--I\'m not\r\ngoing to fag for a cad."\r\n\r\nAnd he vanished.\r\n\r\nCorder went to bed that night sorely perplexed.  And his perplexity was\r\nnot relieved when he rose next morning and found a paper on his table\r\nwith the following genial notice:--\r\n\r\n"Any boy in Forder\'s found speaking to Corder the sneak will be cut by\r\nthe house.  By Order."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SHOP OPENS.\r\n\r\nRobert--no one knew his surname--was a regular institution at\r\nFellsgarth.  Pluralist and jack-of-all-trades as he was, he seemed\r\nunable to make much of a hand at anything he took up.  He was School\r\nporter, owner of the School shop, keeper of the club properties, and\r\noccasional School policeman; and he discharged none of his functions\r\nwell.  The masters did not regard him with much confidence, the boys,\r\nfor the most part, did not care for him, the other men about the place\r\ndisliked him.  And yet, as part and parcel of Fellsgarth, every one put\r\nup with him.\r\n\r\nAs has already been hinted, his management of the School shop had been a\r\nconspicuous failure--both for himself and the young innocents who\r\nsquandered their substance on his tarts.  He complained that he could\r\nmake no profit; and as his method for recouping himself was to supply\r\nthe worst possible article at the highest possible price, his young\r\ncustomers neglected him and aggravated his loss.\r\n\r\nIt was rumoured that another more questionable method of replenishing\r\nhis exchequer was by laying odds on the School games, which (as in the\r\ncase of the second Rendlesham match) did not always turn out in the way\r\nhe expected.  This, however, was only rumour, and was not to be reckoned\r\namong Bob\'s known transgressions, which were general stupidity,\r\nsurliness, unsteadiness, and an inveterate distaste for veracity.\r\n\r\nSuch being his reputation, it astonished no one on the Monday following\r\nthe events recorded in the last chapter to see the shutters of the shop\r\nat the Watch-tower Gate up, and a rudely scrawled announcement, "This\r\nshop is closed."\r\n\r\nBut what did cause astonishment was a subsequent announcement inscribed\r\nin print letters:--\r\n\r\n"This establishment will reopen on Wednesday under entirely new\r\nmanagement.  Superior grub at greatly reduced prices.  No more shoe-\r\nleather or flat swipes!  Best tarts 1 penny each; ditto ginger-beer 11/2\r\npence a bottle.  Fresh fruit and pastry daily.  Rally round the old\r\nshop!\r\n\r\n"By Order."\r\n\r\nSpeculation ran high as to who the enterprising new tradesman could be.\r\nSome said it was Mrs Wisdom.  Others said one of the Penchurch shops\r\nwas going to run it as a branch.  Others suggested that some of the\r\nseniors had a hand in it.  But the truth never once leaked out.\r\n\r\nOur nine juniors played an artful part in that day\'s business.  They\r\nmingled with the crowd in front of the notice, and freely bandied about\r\nwild conjectures as to who the new manager or managers could be, at the\r\nsame time hinting broadly that _they_ intended to patronise the new\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n"Tell you what," said D\'Arcy, "perhaps it\'s the doctor wants to turn an\r\nhonest penny.  Don\'t blame him either."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s Rollitt," suggested Cash, amid laughter.  "What a game!\r\nHe\'ll go selling tarts by the pint and ginger-beer by the ounce.  Whew!\r\nthink of Rollitt\'s ginger-beer."\r\n\r\n"I asked Bob if he knew who it was," said Wally, "and he said, `No, he\r\nwished he did; he\'d get something out of him for good-will.\'"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" asked Ashby.  "If he\'d said bad temper, there might have\r\nbeen some of that going about."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow," said Wally, "I rather fancy the thing myself.  The things\r\ncan\'t be worse than they have been, and if they\'re fresh every day,\r\nthey\'re bound to be better, and the tarts are a halfpenny less, and so\'s\r\nthe ginger-pop."\r\n\r\n"Hooroo!" said Cottle; "you can get half as much again for the same\r\nmoney.  I wish they\'d open to-day."\r\n\r\nAfter which, one by one they tailed off, leaving a general impression\r\nbehind them that whoever else was in the secret, these nine young\r\ninnocent lambs were not.\r\n\r\nMatters had not advanced to this stage without considerable\r\ndeliberation.  Several committee meetings had been held, some of which,\r\nunder Mr Stratton\'s presidency, had been of a practical nature, others,\r\nwithout his controlling presence, had ended in dust.  On the whole,\r\nhowever, the young merchant adventurers had exhibited a reasonable grasp\r\nof their responsibilities and an aptitude for dealing with the necessary\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nOne point discussed was whether the shop should be open all day, or only\r\nat certain times.  Mr Stratton was in favour of the latter.  He urged\r\nthat during the off hours between eleven and twelve, and in the\r\nafternoon between four and six, would be ample.\r\n\r\nThe committee argued, from personal experience, that there were other\r\nhours of the day when a fellow felt in the humour for a "blow out."  To\r\nthis Mr Stratton replied, "Let him `blow out\' by all means, but not on\r\nthe company\'s premises.  He could do his shopping during shop hours, and\r\n`blow out\' with his purchases at any hour of the day or night the School\r\nrules permitted.  They couldn\'t undertake to provide a banqueting hall\r\nfor their customers."\r\n\r\n"But," urged the committee, "if you have a shopman, why not get your\r\nmoney\'s worth out of him?"\r\n\r\n"Why waste our money on a shopman at all?" propounded Mr Stratton to\r\nhis astounded fellow-directors.  "Why not take turns behind the counter\r\nourselves; say one of the Wheatfields and Cash one week, and Cottle and\r\nAshby the next, and so on?  The hours proposed were not school hours;\r\nand though the persons on duty might occasionally be done out of a game,\r\nstill it would fall on all alike, and would be a little sacrifice for\r\nthe common good."\r\n\r\n"But," said Percy, whose hair was on end at this tremendous proposition,\r\n"suppose Wally--that is, I mean, wouldn\'t it be necessary to count the\r\ntarts before each chap went on duty and see how many there were at the\r\nend?"\r\n\r\n"It might with you and your lot," retorted Wally, very red in the face.\r\n"It\'d be best to have a weighing machine handy and charge you 8 pence a\r\npound for every pound extra you weighed at the end of the day!"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll neither count nor weigh," said Mr Stratton; "we\'ll trust to\r\nevery fellow\'s honour.  Why, if we couldn\'t do that, do you suppose the\r\nshop would keep open a week?"\r\n\r\nThis impressed the meeting vastly, and the discussion was changed to the\r\nquestion of profits.\r\n\r\nThe boys were in favour of screwing all they could out of their\r\ncustomers.  They didn\'t see why, if Bob sold bad tarts for three-\r\nhalfpence, they shouldn\'t sell good ones at least for the same price.\r\n\r\n"It\'s giving it to \'em both ends," said they.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said the master.  "We want the fellows to get the benefit.\r\nWe don\'t want all the profit.  As it is, we shall make a farthing on\r\nevery tart we sell.  We ought to sell four times as many as Bob did,\r\noughtn\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Quite that," said they.\r\n\r\n"Very well; see how that works out."\r\n\r\nAnd Mr Stratton took his chalk and worked out this sum on the black-\r\nboard:--\r\n\r\n12 bad tarts at 11/2 pence = 1 shilling, 6 pence, cost 9 pence, profit 9\r\npence.\r\n\r\n48 good tarts at 1 penny = 4 shillings, cost 3 shillings, profit 1\r\nshilling.\r\n\r\n"You see," said he, "if we can only increase the demand, we shall easily\r\nmake Bob\'s profit, and more.  Having good tarts will increase it in one\r\nway, and selling cheap will increase it another.  It\'s worth trying,\r\nanyhow."\r\n\r\nAnd so the deliberations went on, and the boys\' minds gradually took on\r\nthe new idea.\r\n\r\nThe thirty shillings, Mr Stratton reported, had been advanced, and Mrs\r\nStratton was appointed a subcommittee to lay it out.  A method of\r\naccounts was arranged.  The first day\'s stock was to be charged at the\r\nselling price to the shopman for the day.  At the end of the day he was\r\nto hand over to the treasurer the money he had taken and what was left\r\nof the stock, which two items together ought to make up the sum of his\r\nresponsibility.  It was felt that in a very few days the committee would\r\nascertain pretty nearly what quantity of each article was consumed, and\r\nwould be able to order accordingly.  Any deficiency was to be set down\r\nto bad management, and no other reason; and any shopman deficient three\r\ndays running was to forfeit his right to officiate again during that\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nLots were solemnly drawn for the distinction of opening the shop, and\r\nthe choice fell on D\'Arcy, and Lickford, who for the next day or two\r\nwent about shaking in their shoes.  As the day drew nearer, the venture\r\nseemed a tremendous one, and Mr Stratton had to use all his powers of\r\nencouragement to keep his colleagues from not taking fright at the last\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"It will all go swimmingly, you\'ll see," said he.  "I will hold myself\r\nin readiness to come down and back you up if there\'s the least hitch,\r\nbut I shall be greatly disappointed if you need me."\r\n\r\nThe last act of the committee before commencing proceedings was to draw\r\nup a manifesto, which was copied out and duly affixed to the notice\r\nboards and the shop-shutters on the morning of the opening.\r\n\r\n_Under the distinguished patronage of Mr and Mrs Stratton_.\r\n\r\n  The Fellsgarth Shop will be opened this day from 11 to 12,\r\n  And 4 To 8,\r\n  and daily (sundays excepted) till further notice.\r\n  The following prime goods, at the cheap prices affixed.\r\n  [Here followed a list of the stores.]\r\n  Ready money.  No tick.  Change given.\r\n  no more stomach-ache!!\r\n  Real jam!\r\n  Ripe fruit!\r\n  Fresh pastry!\r\n  All the season\'s novelties.  Nothing stale.\r\n  Boys of Fellsgarth--\r\n  Come in your thousands!\r\n  No risk to man or boy.\r\n  No favour.\r\n  Masters and fags treated alike.\r\n  All the profits for the clubs.\r\n  Treasurer, Mrs Stratton.\r\n  Managing directors, Nine gentlemen, Carefully Selected.\r\n  President, Mr Stratton.\r\n  Plenty for all.  No questions asked.\r\n  All are welcome.\r\n  Come early and stay late.\r\n\r\n  _By Order_.\r\n\r\nThis soul-stirring manifesto, which had the hearty approval both of the\r\npresident and treasurer (who carefully revised the spelling), threw some\r\nsatisfactory light on the mystery.  Who were the "carefully selected\r\ngentlemen" was still obscure, although it was generally held that\r\nFellsgarth only contained nine individuals answering to that particular\r\ndescription.  What was more important was that Mr and Mrs Stratton\r\nwere at the back of the venture.  If so, it was not a swindle, and the\r\ngrub was pretty sure to be right.  The new price list, moreover, was\r\nvery satisfactory, and on the whole the hours were approved of.\r\n\r\nWhen the eleven o\'clock bell sounded, on the Wednesday morning, a\r\ngeneral movement was made for the Watch-Tower Gate, where, firmly\r\nentrenched behind a clean counter piled up with the good things a\r\nschoolboy holds dear, demurely stood D\'Arcy and Lickford, looking very\r\nanxious and scared.\r\n\r\nAt judiciously selected points among the crowd their friends looked on\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\nAfter the laughter which had greeted the discovery had died away, an\r\nawkward pause ensued.  No one exactly liked to start.  The seniors\r\npresent felt their dignity would be compromised.  The middle-boys did\r\nnot like to do what the seniors were too shy to do.  The juniors were\r\nafraid some one might laugh if they led off.  Consequently for a minute\r\nor two every one stared at the two shopmen, who cast down their eyes,\r\nand blushed and simpered.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, the ice was broken in a very pretty way.  For Mrs\r\nStratton on her way out of the school looked in, and taking in the\r\nsituation, advanced to the counter and said--\r\n\r\n"A bottle of ginger-beer, if you please, Lickford."\r\n\r\nLickford, who, to use his own polite phrase, was "bossing the drinks and\r\nfruit" for the day, nearly tumbled down with the shock of this sudden\r\nchallenge, and made a wild grab at the nearest bottle within reach.  The\r\neyes of Fellsgarth were upon him; he lost his head entirely, and made\r\nherculean efforts to draw the cork without loosing the wire.  His\r\ncontortions were terrible.\r\n\r\nWhen he could not hold the bottle firm enough between his knees, he\r\ntried gripping it between his feet.  Then in a hot whisper he besought\r\nD\'Arcy to hang on to the end, and for a time the bottle was invisible\r\nunder the two.  Then he took another, amid the enthusiastic cheers of\r\nthe spectators, and was proceeding to release the corkscrew from the\r\nrefractory vessel, when Mrs Stratton said in her pleasant way--\r\n\r\n"I see you keep the new kind of bottles that have the corks wired down.\r\nThey are much better than the old, and it\'s very little trouble undoing\r\nthe wire."\r\n\r\nThis saved Lickford.  In a moment the wire was removed, and the cork\r\nburst out triumphantly, even before it was pulled, showering a grateful\r\nfroth of fizz into the waistcoat of the operator.\r\n\r\n"It\'s beautifully well up.  Thank you, Lickford, how much?" said Mrs\r\nStratton.\r\n\r\n"They\'re a shilling a dozen.  I mean three-halfpence each," said D\'Arcy.\r\n"We can give you change."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s twopence.  I\'ll take a halfpenny apple.  That will make it\r\nright, won\'t it?"\r\n\r\nAnd amid loud cheers she departed.\r\n\r\nThe ice thus broken, a rush took place, as Ridgway, who was poetical,\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Fellows may step in where angels didn\'t fear to tread."\r\n\r\nThen did D\'Arcy and Lickford pant and perspire, and wish they had never\r\nbeen born.  Hands reached in from all sides, and helped themselves to\r\ncakes and tarts, and coppers showered in on them from nobody could tell\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves handing change out into space, and sowing sweets\r\nbroadcast among the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe other directors meanwhile, as in duty bound, nobly rallied round\r\nthem, and added to their embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"Walk up, walk up!" shouted Wally.  "Try our brandy-balls, eight a\r\npenny.  Eight brandy-balls for Dalton; you chaps, look sharp.  Change\r\nfor a sov. for Clapperton; beg pardon, sixpence (didn\'t know he kept\r\nsuch small coins).  Hullo, hullo! stand by for my young brother Percy!\r\nHe\'s just a-going to begin.  Fifteen jam tarts, half a pound of\r\npeppermints, half a dozen ginger-beer.  Bite his money hard, D\'Arcy; see\r\nthere are no bad \'uns.  I know the chap!"\r\n\r\n"Bah!  I hope they\'ve got better toffee here than that muck you make,"\r\nsaid Percy.\r\n\r\n"Come, wake up!" cried Cash.  "I\'ve been waiting five minutes for my\r\ncake."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t have \'em; we\'ve run out," said D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"Well, you must be a green one only to get such a few," said a middle-\r\nboy, who had also built his hopes on the same delicacy.\r\n\r\n"Very sorry," said Percy to the company generally.  "You must excuse\r\nthese chaps--raw hands--they don\'t know how to manage at present.  Give\r\n\'em time.  They\'ll do better; won\'t you, Lickford?  Takes some time to\r\nget a notion into Lickford\'s head, but when it gets there, my word, it\r\nsticks.  Get in a double lot of cakes to-morrow, do you hear, or I shall\r\ngive you the sack."\r\n\r\nDespite these pleasant recriminations the business went on merrily.  The\r\n"tuck" was pronounced a great advance on anything Robert had provided,\r\nand rumours of its excellence penetrated into quarters which had never\r\ncontributed customers to the old shop.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the crowd was less, but the business more steady.  Mr\r\nStratton dropped in for a slice of cake, and Mrs Wakefield and the\r\nthree little Wakefields came to patronise the undertaking.  One or two\r\nfellows, too, sent their fags to secure "extras" for tea, and one or two\r\nleft orders for another day.  Inquiries were made, moreover, for certain\r\narticles, such as lemons, tea-cakes, etcetera, which the shopmen took a\r\nnote of as worth laying in a stock of.  And the lack of demand for a few\r\nof the things they had, suggested to the same astute young merchants\r\nthat they might be dispensed with in future.\r\n\r\nOf course, a few boys tried to interfere with the regulations by\r\ndemanding "tick," and wanting to make bargains.  But they were promptly\r\nmet by a _non possumus_ from the directors present, and finally brought\r\nto reason by being referred to Mr Stratton.\r\n\r\nThe day passed without the necessity of any appeal to the president.  An\r\nanxious consultation was, however, held in his room after closing time.\r\nNaturally, owing to the exceptional rush, the accounts were a little\r\nout, but as they happened to be on the right side this was a matter for\r\ncongratulation rather than distress.  Nearly two pounds had been taken,\r\nand the stock left on hand was valued at five shillings, so that\r\nactually it was possible to repay half of the thirty shillings lent,\r\nafter the very first day.  Mr Stratton, however, advised that only ten\r\nshillings should be repaid this time, and the other five shillings put\r\ninto a reserve fund, in case of need.\r\n\r\n"Of course, you can\'t expect to do as big a business as this every day,"\r\nsaid he.  "It will settle down to a regular jog-trot in a few days, and\r\nthen we shall be able to judge much better how we stand.  I shall be\r\nvery well satisfied if we make about five shillings clear a day."\r\n\r\n"I think you boys have started very well," began the treasurer, but her\r\nhusband held up his finger admonishingly.\r\n\r\n"I should have been very disappointed with them if they had not," said\r\nhe.  "It\'s easy enough to start, the thing will be to keep it up."\r\n\r\n"Remember," he added, "it will be better not to brag out of doors about\r\nour profits or that sort of thing.  It will be time enough to talk about\r\nthat when we are able to hand over a good lump sum to the clubs.  Now\r\nit\'s time you went to preparation.  Good night all."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Lickford to his fellow-shopman as they walked\r\nacross the Green, "we shall have to be pretty smart to-morrow if we\'re\r\nto get to the club meeting."\r\n\r\n"Why," said D\'Arcy, "I thought none of you Modern cads were going to\r\nshow up?"\r\n\r\n"We heard you\'d all funked it," said Wally.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t blame them," said Ashby; "they\'ve not much to be proud of,\r\nthose Modern chaps."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Fisher minor, "Fellsgarth can get on well enough\r\nwithout them."\r\n\r\nThe party came to a halt and regarded one another seriously, and Percy\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Whoever told you we weren\'t going to turn up, told crams.  We\'re\r\ncoming.  We\'ll see you don\'t have it all to yourselves, rather!"\r\n\r\n"My eye, won\'t you get licked for it!  Nice to belong to a house where\r\nyou mayn\'t sneeze unless your senior lets you."\r\n\r\n"Go on!  Shut up!  See if you can\'t canvass a bit.  That\'s what you\'re\r\nbest at--that, and getting it hot on the hands for cheating."  Whereupon\r\nthe troops separated.\r\n\r\nThe taunts of the Classics made their rivals wince, despite their\r\naffected contempt.  To-morrow was the day of the meeting; and between\r\nnow and then they must decide whether or not they would obey their own\r\nseniors and stay away, or revolt and take the consequences.  The\r\nunanimous opinion was in favour of revolt, unless Clapperton made it\r\nuncommonly worth their while to obey.\r\n\r\nThey were not destined to remain long in doubt, for the senior invaded\r\ntheir quarters that very evening.\r\n\r\n"Just remember, you youngsters," said he, "no one is going to the\r\nmeeting to-morrow from our side."\r\n\r\n"Oh?"\r\n\r\n"Any fellow who goes will get it hot, I promise him."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  What about our conditions?  What have you done about them?"\r\n\r\n"Put them in the coal-scuttle; and I\'ve a good mind to put all five of\r\nyou there too, for your impudence."\r\n\r\n"Ah!"\r\n\r\nThe captain turned on his heel, with a final warning.\r\n\r\n"That settles it, you chaps," said Percy, when he had gone.  "We go."\r\n\r\n"Rather," replied everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nSOMETHING WRONG IN THE ACCOUNTS.\r\n\r\nFisher major sat in his study after morning class, next morning, the\r\npicture of boredom and perplexity.  Lists of names, receipt-books, cash-\r\nbox, bills, and account-books were littered on the table before him.\r\nBetween these and a cobweb on the ceiling his troubled looks travelled,\r\nas he gnawed the end of his pen, and passed his fingers aimlessly\r\nthrough his hair.\r\n\r\nThere was something wrong; and what it was he could not for the life of\r\nhim make out.  To any one familiar with Fisher major\'s business--or,\r\nrather, unbusiness--habits, there was nothing wonderful in that.  He was\r\nhappy-go-lucky in all his dealings.  He could receive a subscription one\r\nday, and only remember, in a panic, to enter it a week after.  His money\r\nhe kept all over the place; some in his desk, some in the cash-box, some\r\nin the drawer of his inkstand.  He had a vague idea that he had a\r\nspecial reason for dividing it thus--that one lot may have belonged to\r\nthe School clubs, another to the House clubs, and another to something\r\nelse.  But which was which it passed his wit to remember.\r\n\r\nHe had had his doubts of the business all along.  His friends had urged\r\nhim to take the office, and with their help he had persuaded himself its\r\nduties were simple and easily discharged.  He had determined he would do\r\nthe thing thoroughly well.  He had bought these account-books out of his\r\nown private purse, and spent an evening in beautifully ruling them in\r\nred ink, with one column for the date, one for the name, and three for\r\npounds, shillings, and pence.  He had procured two letter-files,\r\nlabelled respectively "Club" and "House," into which to put his\r\nreceipts.  And he had provided himself with a dozen elastic bands and an\r\nequal number of paper-fasteners.  What more could a treasurer desire?\r\n\r\nAlas! the beautiful account-books got mixed up with one another, the\r\nletter-files remained empty, and the elastic bands somehow did duty as\r\nfootball garters.  The Club accounts were scrawled, for the most part,\r\nin pencil on the backs of envelopes, awaiting a grand transcription into\r\nthe books; and the receipts, pending a similar fortunate time, where\r\nhuddled away in the drawer with Greek verses and letters from the people\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThings had now come to a pass.  The captain had yesterday suggested\r\nthat, in view of the meeting to-day, it would be well to have the\r\naccounts made up, so as to be able, if called upon, to state exactly how\r\nthey stood financially.\r\n\r\n"All serene," said Fisher; "I\'ll let you have the lot in ten minutes."\r\n\r\nIt was now considerably more than ten hours since the rash undertaking\r\nhad been given, and the accounts were considerably more confused than\r\nthey had been when Fisher sat down to square them.\r\n\r\nThe Club and House accounts were hopelessly mixed.  Some fellows\r\nappeared to have paid several times over to both funds, and others not\r\nonce to either.  Worse than that, Fisher could not find his memorandum\r\nof what he had paid out in small disbursements since term began.  Still\r\nworse, when he did come in desperation to lump both funds together, and\r\ndeduct the total amount he had spent, he found himself between L4 and L5\r\nout of pocket!\r\n\r\nThat was the serious discovery which, on this particular morning, was\r\npreying on his spirits and making him look a picture of bewilderment.\r\n\r\n"I\'m bothered if I can make it out," said he to himself.  "Everybody\'s\r\nmarked down as paid--I remember noticing that weeks ago.  At that rate I\r\nought to have L25 for the Clubs, and L9 12 shillings for the House.\r\nYes, that\'s right--I had that; there\'s a note of it; three lots--L15 7\r\nshillings 6 pence on September 1, L7 2 shillings 6 pence on September\r\n13, and L12 2 shillings on another day--that makes the total.  There you\r\nare.  Why on earth did I put them away in separate lots?  Then I paid L5\r\nfor the new goals, and something else--what was it?  Oh, that was for\r\nthe House balls--oh, but we are lumping the two together.  What was it?\r\nI know, 17 shillings 6 pence--that\'s L5 17 shillings 6 pence; and\r\nsomething else, I know, came to a pound--L6 17 shillings 6 pence.  Take\r\nthat from L34 12 shillings, leaves L27 14 shillings 6 pence--and I\'ve\r\nonly got L22 18 shillings 6 pence!  Where, in the name of wonder, has\r\nthe rest gone?"\r\n\r\nAnd once more the dismal operation of adding up, counting, and\r\nsubtracting began anew, with the same, or almost the same, result--there\r\nwas a mistake of something like L4 10 shillings, whichever way you\r\nlooked at it.\r\n\r\nDalton, who came in presently, could throw no further light on the\r\nproblem.  He added up the columns, counted the money, subtracted the\r\npayments and arrived at the same result.\r\n\r\nHad the difference been smaller, it might have been accounted for by a\r\nfew subscriptions omitted or a few payments not entered.  But L4 10\r\nshillings was too big a sum to leak away by accident; and, with the\r\nexception of the new goals, Fisher major was confident nothing had been\r\nspent approaching the figure.\r\n\r\nDalton then proposed a fresh hunt through the study, in case the missing\r\nsum might be hidden for safety in some corner.  So the room was turned\r\nupside down; the bed-clothes were shaken out, pockets searched, books\r\nturned over, tea-pots peered into; but all to no purpose.\r\n\r\nThe captain looked in while the search was proceeding.\r\n\r\n"Have you got the-- Hullo, what\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"Why," said Fisher major, "there\'s a discrepancy.  We ought to have L27\r\n14 shillings 6 pence, and there\'s about L4 10 shillings short."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that\'s missing in the Club accounts?"\r\n\r\n"Well, either in that or the House clubs, or in both lumped together.  I\r\nsay, I wish you\'d add that up, there\'s a good fellow.  The addition may\r\nbe wrong."\r\n\r\nBut no; the captain made it the same as Dalton.\r\n\r\nRanger and Ridgway dropped in while the audit was in progress, and were\r\npromptly pounced upon to add the columns too.  Evidently the mistake was\r\nnot there.  They made the total precisely the same.\r\n\r\n"It must be in the payments, then," said Fisher.  So the whole party sat\r\ndown, and scrutinised the hapless treasurer\'s bills and vouchers, and,\r\nafter allowing him the benefit of every imaginable doubt, still brought\r\nthe deficit out at the same uncompromising figure.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s have another look round," suggested Fisher.  So once more the\r\nstudy was turned topsy-turvy, and every nook and cranny searched.  But\r\nno money was there, nor any sign of it.\r\n\r\nThe captain looked grave.\r\n\r\n"It\'s precious awkward," said he.\r\n\r\n"It\'s sure to turn up," said Fisher.  "I\'ll go over the whole thing\r\nagain, and have the room searched."\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile," said Ranger, "it\'s to be hoped no questions are asked by\r\nthe fellows opposite."\r\n\r\n"Not much chance; I hear they are none of them going to turn up," said\r\nDalton.\r\n\r\n"That\'s their look-out," responded the captain.\r\n\r\nMuch to their disgust, Ashby and Fisher minor were summoned from the\r\nvicinity of the shop that morning to assist the treasurer in his\r\nhopeless search.  They did not mind turning a study upside down on their\r\nown account, but they strongly objected to have to do it for any one\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nFisher major did not at first vouchsafe much information with regard to\r\nthe missing object.\r\n\r\n"Look round everywhere," said he, "and see if you see anything."\r\n\r\nAshby looked, and said he saw a lot of things.\r\n\r\n"I mean money, of course," said the treasurer.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the two simultaneously made a grab at the loose cash on the\r\ntable, declaring they had found it first go off.\r\n\r\n"No--not that.  It\'s some that\'s missing."\r\n\r\n"How much?" asked Ashby.\r\n\r\n"Never mind--a pound or two."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure it\'s about in the room?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I want you to look and see, you young donkey!"\r\n\r\n"Two pounds," said Ashby; "was it all in silver?"\r\n\r\n"No--it was three or four pounds--about L4 10.  I don\'t know what it was\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"Four pound ten--that\'s a lot," said the young brother.  "I thought you\r\nsaid you were hard up?"\r\n\r\n"So I did.  It\'s not my money, but the club\'s.  What\'s that to do with\r\nit?  I want you to see if you can find it while I\'m down in class."\r\n\r\nWhereupon they set to work.  They emptied the contents of every drawer\r\nin a glorious heap on the floor.  They shook out his socks, and turned\r\nthe pockets of all his coats inside out.  They pulled his bed about the\r\nroom, and shook out all his sheets.  They raked out his fire, and prised\r\nup a loose board in the floor.  They emptied his basins into his bath,\r\nand investigated the works of his eight-day clock.  But high or low they\r\ncould find no money.\r\n\r\nFisher\'s study did not get over that morning\'s quest in a hurry.  When\r\nthe owner returned, he wished devoutly he had never been ass enough to\r\nconfide the task to a couple of raw Goths like these.  Whatever chance\r\nthere may have been before of discovering any mislaid article, it was\r\nnow hopelessly and irredeemably gone.\r\n\r\nHe dismissed the two youngsters with a kick, which they felt to be very\r\nungrateful after all the trouble they had taken.  Limp in spirits and\r\ngrimy in personal appearance, they crawled away to the shop to console\r\nthemselves with ginger-beer and a cheese-cake.\r\n\r\n"Hullo," said Lickford, as they arrived, "what have you been up to?\r\nSweeping the chimneys?  I heard they wanted it on your side.  What\'ll\r\nyou have?  We\'ve been doing prime.  Where have you been?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been hunting about in my senior\'s study for some club money\r\nthat\'s lost; about four pou--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!" said Ashby, nudging his companion.  "What do you want to blab\r\nall over the place about it for?"\r\n\r\n"How much?--four pounds?" said a voice near; and looking round, to their\r\nhorror they saw Dangle.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Ashby, trying to save the situation, "it\'s bound to\r\nturn up.  He stuck it in a specially safe place, and can\'t remember\r\nwhere.  Look sharp with the ginger-beer, young Lickford."\r\n\r\n"Money down first," said Lickford.  "Catch me trusting any of you\r\nClassic chaps with tick!  You\'ve got no tin generally, to begin with,\r\nand then you go and lose it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s better than stealing it," retorted Ashby.\r\n\r\n"The thing is," said Dangle, breaking in on these pleasant\r\nrecriminations, "it wouldn\'t matter if it was Fisher\'s own money that\r\nwas lost.  But it belongs to all of us."\r\n\r\n"I tell you he\'s found it by now," said Ashby.  Then, turning to Fisher\r\nminor, he whispered, "you howling young ass, you\'ve done it!  Now\r\nthere\'ll be a regular row, and your brother will have you to thank for\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t blame him," said Dangle.  "It\'s quite right of him to tell the\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\nWith which highly moral pronouncement the Modern senior strolled away.\r\n\r\nLickford was too much engrossed by a sudden influx of customers to\r\nimprove the occasion; and Fisher minor, who never enjoyed ginger-beer\r\nless in his life, was allowed to depart in peace to meditate on the evil\r\nof his ways, and the possible hot water he had been preparing for his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nHe had sense enough to reflect that he had better make a clean breast of\r\nit to his brother at once.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, the latter took the news that Dangle had heard of the\r\ndeficiency in the accounts more quietly than he had expected.\r\n\r\n"I do wish you\'d hold your tongue out of doors about things that don\'t\r\nconcern you," said he.\r\n\r\n"Will Dangle get you into a row?" asked Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"Dangle?  I\'m not responsible to him more than to any one else.  The\r\nmoney\'s lost; and unless I can find it or make out where the mistake\r\ncomes in, I shall have to stump up--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"But, I say, you haven\'t got money enough," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"I know that, you young duffer."\r\n\r\n"Whatever will you do?"\r\n\r\nFisher major laughed.\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t steal it, if that\'s any comfort to you; and I shan\'t cook the\r\naccounts."\r\n\r\n"I say, I wonder if Rollitt could lend it you.  He must have some money,\r\nfor he paid for Widow Wisdom\'s new boat, you know."\r\n\r\n"I heard of that.  I wish I saw my way to paying my debts as well as he\r\ndid."\r\n\r\n"I say, shall I ask him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not.  The best thing you can do is to shut up."\r\n\r\nFisher minor felt very grateful to his brother for not thrashing him,\r\nand went in to afternoon school meekly, though out of spirits.\r\n\r\n"Well," said D\'Arcy, as he took his place, "what\'s the latest?  Who are\r\nyou going to get into a mess now!  Has Yorke been swindling anybody\r\nlately, or Ranger been getting tight!  You\'re bound to have some story\r\nabout somebody."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean-- It\'s not wicked to lose money," pleaded Fisher minor.\r\n"I never thought--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said Wally.  "You couldn\'t if you tried.  Dangle will\r\nmake a nice thing out of it, thanks to you.  Classic treasurer been and\r\ncollared Modern boys\' money--that sort of thing--and they\'ll kick him\r\nout and stick in one of their own lot, and call it triumph of honesty.\r\nOh, you beauty; you _can_ do things nicely when you try?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I\'d never come up here at all," moaned Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"Humph.  That would have been a bad go for Fellsgarth," said D\'Arcy.\r\n"Shut up--Forder\'s looking.  If we\'re lagged we shan\'t get in to the\r\nmeeting."\r\n\r\nThe dreaded misadventure did not occur; and punctually at the hour our\r\nfour young gentlemen trooped into Hall.  Everything was very quiet\r\nthere.  The place was only half full.  The Classics had turned up in\r\nforce, but the mutineering house was so far unrepresented.  Presently,\r\nhowever, five juvenile figures might be seen marching arm in arm across\r\nthe Green, keeping a sharp look-out on every side.\r\n\r\nBefore they arrived in Hall, a solitary figure wearing the Modern\r\ncolours had made his way up to the seniors\' end.  It was Corder, looking\r\nvery limp and haggard, and with a savage flash of the eyes which told\r\nhow ill "Coventry" was agreeing with his spirits.  The cheers, with\r\nwhich he was greeted, due quite as much to his pluck in coming to-day as\r\nto his exploit at the match last Saturday, appeared to disconcert rather\r\nthan please him, and he took a corner seat as far as possible from the\r\nClassic seniors present.  When, however, Percy and Co. entered the Hall,\r\na much livelier demonstration ensued.  Cheers and compliments and pats\r\non the back showered fast on the youthful "blacklegs," and tended\r\ngreatly to exaggerate in their own eyes the importance of their action.\r\n\r\n"We shall get jolly well welted for it, you fellows," said Percy, with\r\nall the swagger of a popular martyr.  "Never mind; we aren\'t going to be\r\ndone out of Hall for anybody."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, they won\'t hurt _you_ for it," cried Wally, disparaging.\r\n"Kids like you won\'t hurt."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve come to see you cads don\'t get it all your own way," said Cash.\r\n"That\'s what we\'ve come for!"\r\n\r\n"Ho, ho!  Hope you\'ve brought your lunch.  You\'ll be kept here a day or\r\ntwo, if you\'re going to wait for that!"\r\n\r\nWhen Yorke and the other prefects arrived on the scene there were, of\r\ncourse, loud cheers; but as the opposition was not there to make any\r\ncounter-demonstration, it was not quite as noisy as on former occasions.\r\n\r\nPercy did, indeed, attempt to get up a little opposition at this stage\r\nby calling for "three cheers for the Moderns"; but as he was left to\r\ngive them by himself--even his own adherents declining to be drawn into\r\ncheers for Clapperton--the display fell rather flat.\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s speech was short and to the point.  Of course they knew\r\nwhy the meeting was called.  There had been mutiny at Fellsgarth.\r\nFellows had deliberately set themselves against his authority as\r\ncaptain, which was a minor thing, and against the success of Fellsgarth\r\nin sports, which was a low and shabby thing.  (Cheers.)  He wasn\'t going\r\nto mention names; but he meant to say this, that they had much better\r\ndissolve the club right away--(No, no)--than not all pull together.\r\nLast Saturday, as every one knew, they had been left utterly in the\r\nlurch; and but for good luck, and the good play of some of the fifteen--\r\namongst whom, he was glad to say, was one fellow who had had the pluck\r\nto act on his own judgment of what was due to the School--(loud and\r\nprolonged cheers, in the midst of which Corder perked up, and looked\r\npleased)--they had held their own with a very scratch team.  They\r\ncouldn\'t expect to do as much again--(Why not?)--and it _was not_ fair\r\nto the School to play matches without all their best men in the team.\r\nThe proposal he had to make was that unless the fellows now standing out\r\nchose to return to their allegiance to the School within a week, all\r\nfuture matches for the term should be scratched, and the club dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s proposal caused considerable consternation.  Ridgway rose,\r\nand said he considered the motion dealt far too leniently with the\r\nmutineers.  He would say, drum them out of the club, and reorganise\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\nDenton asked if it would not be more honest and straightforward to\r\nsummon them to the next match, and if they didn\'t turn up give them the\r\nthrashing they deserved?\r\n\r\nFisher major said he supported the captain\'s proposal.  It was nonsense\r\ntheir playing with scratch teams, and letting it be supposed that was\r\nthe best the School could do.  Some of the fellows on strike were no\r\ndoubt good players, and that made it all the more discreditable of them\r\nto try to damage the School record by crippling the team.  They no doubt\r\nhoped that they would be begged to rejoin on their--own terms.  Rather\r\nthan that, he was in favour of disbanding the club, and letting the\r\nfellows devote their energy to running and jumping, and other sports,\r\nwhere each fellow could distinguish himself independently of what any\r\nothers chose to do.  (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\nRanger also supported Yorke\'s motion.  Very likely the mutineers would\r\ncrow, and say the club couldn\'t get on without them.  No more they\r\ncould, in a sense.  But he, for one, was not going to ask them to come\r\nback, and would sooner break up the club, and let them have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing they had injured Fellsgarth.\r\n\r\nAmid loud cheers Corder followed.  He was sorry, he said, there was to\r\nbe no more football, but supposed there was nothing else they could do.\r\nHe was glad to see some Moderns present, even though they were only\r\njuniors.  (Laughter.)  It showed that there were some fellows on the\r\nModern side that stuck by the School.  He fancied these youngsters could\r\ntake care of themselves.  He was glad to hear a human voice again.\r\n(Laughter.)  It might be fun to some present, but he could assure them\r\nit was none to him.  No one had spoken to him for four days.  He was cut\r\nby his house, and had to thank even some of the juniors present for\r\nassisting to make his life in Forder\'s miserable.  He didn\'t care much,\r\nso far.  They might make him cave in, in the long run.  (No!  Stick\r\nout!)  Let the fellow who cried "Stick out," come and try it.  His only\r\noffence had been that he had played for the School.  To do anything for\r\nthe School was now considered a crime on the Modern side.  (Shame.)\r\nAnyhow, he should vote for the captain\'s motion; and though he wasn\'t\r\nparticularly sweet on the Classics as a body, he was beginning to think\r\nthey weren\'t quite as bad as his own side.\r\n\r\nPercy hereupon rose, amid derisive cheers.  He didn\'t know why the names\r\nof him and his lot had been brought in; but he just wanted to say that\r\nthey were here to-day because they had a right to come, and weren\'t\r\ngoing to be kept out by anybody--not if they knew it.  (Rather not!)  He\r\nand his lot thought there wasn\'t much to choose between anybody,\r\nespecially the juniors of the Classic side, who thought they were jolly\r\nclever, but were about the biggest stuck-uppest louts he-- (Order.  Kick\r\nhim out.)  He hoped the meeting would rally round the School shop, where\r\nevery one was treated alike, and got the best grub for the money of any\r\nschool going.  They were going to get some Ribston-- (Order.  Time.)\r\nAll right.  They shouldn\'t hear what he was going to say now.  (Loud\r\ncheers.)\r\n\r\nYorke said they all seemed to be pretty much of the same mind; and he\r\nwould put his motion to the vote.\r\n\r\nThis accordingly was done, and carried without a dissentient voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nA BELEAGUERED GARRISON.\r\n\r\nThe decision arrived at by the club meeting speedily came to the ears of\r\nthe recalcitrant Moderns, and by no means pleased them.  They had\r\nexpected at least that some one would propose that they should be met\r\nhalf-way, and appealed to, for the sake of the School, to abandon their\r\nattitude.  That would have given them an opportunity of figuring in an\r\nheroic light before Fellsgarth, and showing how, for the general good,\r\nthey could afford even to overlook the slight which had been put upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut now, so far from that, they figured as the party who had wrecked the\r\nSchool clubs for the sake of a petty pique, and in their absence had\r\nbeen quietly deposed along with every one else from office and\r\nprivilege, and left looking uncommonly foolish and uncommonly\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nYorke himself hardly realised, when he made his downright motion, that\r\nhe was dealing the hardest blow possible at the mutiny.  A mutiny is all\r\nvery well as long as there is some one to mutiny against.  But now, even\r\nthis luxury was denied them.\r\n\r\nNaturally the wrath of Clapperton and his friends fell on the traitors\r\nin their own camp whose presence at the meeting had made it impossible\r\nto discredit it as entirely one-sided in its composition.\r\n\r\nThat Corder would go, every one was prepared for.  He had laid up for\r\nhimself yet one more rod in pickle, and should punctually taste its\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nBut the mutiny of the juniors was a surprise.  No one imagined that\r\ntheir threats at revolt were anything more than the ordinary bluster in\r\nwhich these young braves notoriously dealt.  Had they sinned in\r\nignorance it would have mattered less.  But they had gone to the meeting\r\nin deliberate defiance of their captain\'s order, and in the face of his\r\nwarning as to what the consequences of disobedience would be.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the house was at an end if a flagrant act of\r\ninsubordination like this was to be allowed to pass unnoticed.  Besides,\r\nif allowed to spread, other fellows would go over to the enemy, and the\r\n"moral" effect of the strike would be at an end.\r\n\r\nA peremptory summons was therefore dispatched to Percy and his friends\r\nto appear before the prefects of their house that same evening.\r\n\r\n"That all?" inquired Percy of the middle-boy who brought the message.\r\n"We hear you.  You needn\'t stop."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell him you\'ll come?" said the messenger.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind what you tell him.  Cut out of our room, that\'s all.  We\r\naren\'t particular, me and my chaps; but we draw the line at louts."\r\n\r\n"He says if you don\'t come--"\r\n\r\n"What\'s to prevent him saying anything he likes?  Look here, young\r\nGamble," (Gamble was at least two years the senior of any boy present),\r\n"if you don\'t cut your sticks, they\'ll be cut for you.  So there."\r\n\r\nGamble gave a general invitation to the party to come and try to tamper\r\nwith his sticks, and departed with a final caution as to the\r\ndesirability of obeying their captain.\r\n\r\n"Lick," said Percy, when he had gone, "how much grub have we got in the\r\nroom?"\r\n\r\n"What are you talking about?  You aren\'t hungry surely, after that go-in\r\nat the shop?"\r\n\r\n"Have we got enough for two days?"\r\n\r\nThe party opened their eyes, and began to suspect the drift of the\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n"No; but Maynard owes us a loaf, and Spanker some butter, and those kids\r\nin Reynolds\' study half a tongue."\r\n\r\n"All right; go out and get it all in, sharp.  Scrape up all you can."\r\n\r\n"What, are we going to have a blockade?"\r\n\r\n"Rather.  You don\'t suppose we\'re going to cave in to Clapperton, do\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"But we shan\'t want enough for two days, shall we?"\r\n\r\n"Shan\'t we, that\'s all!  To-morrow\'s exeat day, and no school.  Next\r\nday\'s Sunday, and next day exeat doesn\'t end till twelve.  We may have\r\nto stick out three days."\r\n\r\n"Whew! we _shall_ want a lot of grub," said Cash.\r\n\r\n"You young pig; that\'s all you think about.  You\'ll have to go on jolly\r\nshort rations, I can promise you.  Do you know what we\'re going to do?"\r\n\r\nNo one had an idea what they were going to do.\r\n\r\n"Do you know those four Classic kids," said Percy, "my younger brother\r\nand his lot?  They\'ve not been quite such cads lately as they used to\r\nbe, have they?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve been a bit more civil," said Cottle.  "I suppose that\'s because\r\nof the shop."\r\n\r\n"What about them?" asked Ramshaw.\r\n\r\n"Why, I fancy if we asked them, they might come over and back us up.  Of\r\ncourse they\'d have to bring their own grub; and we\'d kick them out if\r\nthey weren\'t civil.  What do you say?"\r\n\r\n"Rather a lark," said Lickford.\r\n\r\n"All serene.  I\'ll go and see about it.  Keep it dark, whatever you do,\r\nand mind you scrape up all the grub that\'s owing us.  There\'s no time to\r\nlose, I say; Clapperton expects us in half an hour.  Wire in!"\r\n\r\nBy the end of half an hour the larder had been fairly well replenished.\r\nLickford and Cash had gone round on a general raid; recovering by force,\r\nwhere persuasion failed, their outstanding loans, and in other cases\r\nborrowing additional supplies in the same genial manner.  Among other\r\nbooty, they secured a tin of pressed beef from Spanker, who had to be\r\nclouted on the head before he would "lend it," and some sardines from\r\nanother boy, who was thankful to find any one to take them off his hands\r\nat any price.\r\n\r\nCottle and Ramshaw, acting on sealed orders from their leader, had been\r\nround borrowing a screw-driver and screws, a few yards of rope, and\r\nother material of war, among which was a squirt belonging to Reynolds,\r\nwho had been pleased to "swap" it for a couple of Greek stamps which\r\nCottle had to dispose of.\r\n\r\nMany were the fears lest not only should Percy fail to secure the\r\nservices of the Classic juniors, but should himself be too late to take\r\npart in the siege.  However, much to their relief, this was not so; as\r\npresently he came over arm in arm with Wally (who carried a parcel under\r\nhis arm), followed at a respectful distance by D\'Arcy, Ashby, and Fisher\r\nminor, the bulkiness of whose pockets gave promise of a further addition\r\nto the sinews of war.\r\n\r\nBy general consent the visitors slipped in, not in a body, but casually\r\none by one, and so escaped special observation.  As soon as they were\r\nall assembled, Percy gave the order to screw up, and pile on the\r\nbarricades.\r\n\r\n_Wally_, who was disposed to be patronising, snuffed up somewhat at his\r\nbrother\'s calm assumption of the command.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you say you wanted screws?" said he; "we\'ve got one or two\r\nlong ones.  That\'s not the way to stick it in, young Lickford; make the\r\nhole more sideways.  Here, I\'ll do it for you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what," said D\'Arcy, "you chaps had better begin to move\r\nup the bed against the door, in case they come before we\'re fast in.\r\nFire away.  Stick it close up, and young Lickford can stand on to it to\r\nput in the screw."\r\n\r\n"Come on, Cash; stick these parcels out of the way," said Ashby, handing\r\nout the provender; "they\'ll be better in the cupboard.  Mind how you put\r\nthem in."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got a knife, Cottle," said Fisher minor.  "Cut these bits of\r\nwood into wedges to go under the door.  They\'ll make it pretty secure."\r\n\r\nIn this manner the Classic auxiliaries coolly took charge of the\r\narrangements before ever their hosts had time to realise that they had\r\nbeen relegated to a back seat.\r\n\r\nHowever, just now there was no time for arguing questions of precedence\r\nand authority.  The enemy might be upon them at any moment, and they had\r\na lot to do before their outworks could be said to be in a proper state\r\nof defence.\r\n\r\nThe screws in the door were driven hard home into the wainscot; the\r\nwedges underneath were tightly fixed.  The bed, with bedding complete,\r\nwas drawn against the entry.  A second line of defence was thrown up of\r\nchairs, chest of drawers, book-case, and wash-stand.  Beyond that were\r\nstacked against the wall cricket bats, stumps, boxing-gloves, and other\r\ndangerous-looking implements, for use in a last emergency.  At Percy\'s\r\nsuggestion, and under Wally\'s direction, an additional loophole was\r\nbored in the panel of the door (in flagrant forgetfulness of the rights\r\nof School property), through which, as well as through the ventilating\r\nholes above, the enemy might be reconnoitred and operated on.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries being complete, and Fisher minor having been perched\r\non the table (which was on the bed), with his eye to the loophole, the\r\ncompany, to pass the time, resolved itself into a committee on the\r\nSchool shop, and waited anxiously for the attack.\r\n\r\nPercy was specially anxious, for he had enlisted his four recruits on\r\nthe distinct understanding there would be a row, and all the blame would\r\nfall on his head if by any ill-luck the evening passed off quietly.\r\n\r\nAlready the Classic juniors were beginning to get impatient, and hinting\r\nthat they saw no fun in the proceeding so far, when Fisher minor\r\nscrambled down from his perch and cried:\r\n\r\n"Sh!--here comes somebody."\r\n\r\n"About time," said Wally, taking possession of the squirt.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the footsteps halted at the door, and the handle turned.\r\n\r\n"Lie low, you chaps," whispered Percy.  "Don\'t let them know you\'re here\r\nto begin with.  Hullo! who\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Let me in!" cried Gamble, outside.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t; we\'re busy," replied Lickford.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got a committee meeting, and you\'d better cut," cried Percy.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear?" replied the ambassador; "let me in."\r\n\r\n"There\'s plenty of room in your own study, ain\'t there?  Why don\'t you\r\ngo there?  We don\'t want you here."\r\n\r\n"Cut your sticks, and learn your rotten Modern lessons," shouted Wally,\r\nwho began to be tired of being a listener.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Cottle knocked over one of the chairs at this juncture, which\r\nserved to conceal the voice of the speaker from the ears outside.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Gamble; "you\'ll catch it.  Clapperton sent me to tell\r\nyou if you don\'t come to his room directly, he\'ll come and fetch you\r\nhimself.  There!"\r\n\r\n"Good evening," cried Ramshaw.  "Our love to them all at home."\r\n\r\nD\'Arcy, meanwhile, had mounted the bed, and by means of a pea-shooter\r\nmaterially assisted in the departure of the discomfited envoy.\r\n\r\n"Now we\'re getting livery," said Wally, proceeding to load his squirt\r\nout of the jug.  "Better light the candle, one of you, and have some\r\nlight on the subject."\r\n\r\nA terrible discovery ensued.  Neither candle nor matches could be found!\r\nIn a quarter of an hour daylight would depart, and after that--well,\r\nthe prospect was not brilliant, at any rate.  However, there was no time\r\nto do anything but recriminate, which the company industriously did\r\nuntil the sentinel again gave the signal to stand by.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Percy, "we\'d better keep him jawing as long as he\'ll\r\nstand it, and not let fly till he begins to get violent--eh?"\r\n\r\n"All serene," said Wally; "that won\'t be long."\r\n\r\n"No; and he\'ll bring the whole kit of prefects with him.  What a high\r\nold time there\'ll be!" chuckled D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one lucky thing," said Cash.  "Forder and his dame have gone\r\nout for the evening; so we shan\'t hurt _their_ feelings."\r\n\r\n"Look out--it\'s Clapperton," whispered the sentinel.\r\n\r\nClapperton tried the door, and on finding it fast, gave it a kick.\r\n\r\n"Hello! who\'s there?"\r\n\r\n"Open the door; let me in!"\r\n\r\n"Who is it? that young cad Gamble again?" cried Percy, with a wink; the\r\ncompany generally.\r\n\r\n"No.  Do you hear?  Let me in!"\r\n\r\n"Say what your name is.  How do we know you aren\'t a Classic cad?  Oh!\r\now!"\r\n\r\nThis last interjection was in answer to a fraternal kick from behind.\r\n\r\n"You know who I am," replied Clapperton.  "Let me in!"\r\n\r\n"Very sorry, Corder, we can\'t let you in.  Clapperton says we\'re to cut\r\nyou, because you played a jolly sight too well last week."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not Corder, it\'s me--Clapperton."\r\n\r\n"Go on! no larks, whoever you are.  Clapperton\'s got something better to\r\ndo than go to tea-parties in fags\' rooms.  Go and tell that to the\r\nClap-- Oh! ow!  I mean, try it on next door!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Clapperton, whose temper, none of the best, was\r\nrapidly evaporating, "if you young cads don\'t open the door instantly,\r\nI\'ll break it open."\r\n\r\n"If you do, we\'ll tell Clapperton.  He\'ll welt you for it.  _He_ won\'t\r\nlet you spoil our new paint, not if he knows it.  Good old Clappy?"\r\n\r\nA thundering kick was the only reply, which shook the plaster of the\r\nwalls, and nearly sent Fisher minor headlong with terror off his perch.\r\n\r\nThis was getting serious.  But in Percy\'s judgment the time was not even\r\nyet ripe for extreme measures.  The assailant might be given a little\r\nrope yet.\r\n\r\nHe took it, and worked himself into a childish passion against the\r\nrefractory door, encouraged by the friendly gibes of the besieged.  "Go\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"Two to one on his boots!"\r\n\r\n"Keep your temper!"\r\n\r\n"Come in!"  "Stick to it!"  "One more and you\'ll do it!" and so on.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly likely that the spectacle of the captain of the house in a\r\ntowering rage, toying to kick his way into a fag\'s room, would long be\r\nallowed to continue unheeded by the rest of the inhabitants of Forder\'s,\r\nand in a very short time new voices without apprised the beleaguered\r\ngarrison that the enemy was sitting down in force.\r\n\r\nBrinkman\'s voice could be heard demanding admission, and presently\r\nDangle\'s; while a _posse_ of mercenary middle-boys relieved Clapperton\r\nof the kicking.  The stout old door held out bravely and defied all\r\ntheir efforts.\r\n\r\nPresently a pause was made, and Dangle\'s voice outside was heard\r\ndemanding a parley.\r\n\r\n"Young Wheatfield," he said, "it will be wiser for you to open the door\r\nat once.  If you don\'t it will be broken open, and you needn\'t expect to\r\nget off easy then.  Take my advice, and don\'t be a fool."\r\n\r\n"Thanks awfully," said Percy.  "I and my chaps are just going to sit\r\ndown to tea.  Wish you could join us, whoever you are.  We\'ve got as\r\nmuch right to have tea in our study as you have in yours.  That\'s right!\r\nKick away!  Never mind the varnish!  Somebody tapping at the study\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no good wasting time over young asses like them," Brinkman was\r\nheard to say.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to go now," said Clapperton.  "They shall have such a\r\nhiding, all of them, as they won\'t forget in a hurry."\r\n\r\n"It\'s funny how when we seniors strike against the School it\'s so noble,\r\nand when these juniors strike against us it\'s so inexcusable," said\r\nFullerton.  "Strikes always did puzzle me."\r\n\r\n"If, instead of talking rubbish, you\'d go and fetch Robert with a\r\ncrowbar to smash open the door," said Clapperton, "you\'d be more use."\r\n\r\nIt was getting quite dark in the room by this time, but Wally could be\r\nheard refilling his squirt at the jug, "I mean to start now," said he.\r\n\r\nPercy came beside him.\r\n\r\n"All serene," said he; "but why use water when there\'s ink?"\r\n\r\n"My eye!  I never thought of that.  Rather!  I say, old man, while I\r\nremember it, I\'ll write home this week.  Don\'t you fag, good old Percy."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, it\'s my turn."\r\n\r\n"Oh, let me.  Is that the ink-pot?  Hold it tight while I get a good go\r\nat it."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we tickle them up with the pea-shooter first," suggested\r\nLickford.  "Mind how you go over the chairs, Cash," added he, as that\r\nhero in the dark got entangled in the second line of fortifications.\r\n\r\n"All serene--wire away!  Young Ashby, you\'d better mix up some soap and\r\ncoal-dust in the water for use when the ink\'s done."\r\n\r\nBy this time the attack without had redoubled, and Cash, mounting up to\r\nthe loophole, began to operate on the besiegers with his pea-shooter.\r\nHe had to guess where to shoot, for though the gas was alight in the\r\npassage, he was unable for anatomical reasons to look and shoot through\r\nthe same hole at the same time.  However, he had the satisfaction of\r\nfeeling sure his fire was taking effect, by the aggravated exclamations\r\nof the besiegers, who vowed terrific vengeance for this fresh insult.\r\nIn due time the marksman fell short of ammunition and was carefully\r\nhelped down from his post in the dark, while Wally and Percy, gingerly\r\ncarrying the squirt, ascended in his place.\r\n\r\n"Hand up the basin," said Wally, "and get another lot of water ready."\r\n\r\n"I say," said Fisher minor, who was always being seized by heroic\r\nimpulses, "if you could let me down out of the window by the rope, I\'d\r\nbe able to get a candle."\r\n\r\n"Good old `How now!\' awfully good notion," said Wally.  "You chaps see\r\nto that, while my young brother and I work the squirt.  Don\'t tell\r\nanybody what\'s up, young Fisher, and get back as soon as you can."\r\n\r\nSo, while the squirt was carefully being levelled in the face of the\r\nenemy, Fisher minor, with the end of the rope round his waist, was\r\nswinging precariously in mid-air out of the window, heartily repenting,\r\nuntil his feet touched _terra firma_, of his rash and desperate\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nBefore he was safe, the great attack had been delivered through the\r\nloophole.  The kickers had receded from the door a pace or two in order\r\nto get up impetus for a combined onslaught, and Clapperton with a poker\r\nin his hand was advancing to annihilate the lock, when Percy, who was\r\nreconnoitring from the ventilating holes, gave the signal to have at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Wally let fly with all his might, and converted half of the\r\nenemy, their captain included, into Ethiopians.\r\n\r\nThe effect was instantaneous.  The four-footed kick did not come off.\r\nClapperton\'s poker fell with a clatter on the floor, and a howl went up\r\nwhich electrified both besiegers and besieged.\r\n\r\n"Look alive now!" said Wally.  "Let \'em have the water!  Keep it up!"\r\n\r\nFor five minutes an almost uninterrupted flow of coloured water poured\r\nthrough the loophole and kept the enemy at bay.  But even a jugful will\r\nnot last for ever, and presently the squirt gave a dismal groan on the\r\nbottom of the basin.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment an ominous crack proclaimed that the good old\r\ndoor was giving way by degrees under the now renewed attack of the\r\nbesiegers.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll have it, after all," said Percy.\r\n\r\n"Tell you what!  Suppose we slip out by the window, and you chaps come\r\nand have supper in our room.  Rather a lark, eh?  It\'s getting a bit\r\nslow here.  Nice sell for them too.  Besides, they can\'t get at you over\r\non our side."\r\n\r\nThis hospitable invitation fitted in with the humour of the company\r\ngenerally, particularly as every moment the door gave a more doubtful\r\nsound than before.\r\n\r\nIn three minutes the whole party was on the grass below, where Fisher\r\nminor, returning breathless, with a candle and matches, encountered\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Come on, you chaps," said Wally.  "I\'d give sixpence to see how they\r\nlook when they find we\'ve gone--ha! ha!"\r\n\r\nThey salved their honour with a keen sense of the humour of the\r\nsituation, and followed their host across the Green in the dark, not at\r\nall sorry to have a harbour of refuge in sight, though very loth to\r\nadmit that this rearward movement was a retreat.\r\n\r\nAt the door of Wakefield\'s, to their consternation, they met Ranger.\r\n\r\n"What on earth are all you youngsters up to at this hour?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right," said Wally.  "The shop committee, you know.  We\'re\r\ngoing to talk things over in my room.  Come on, you Modern kids.  We\'ll\r\nmake an exception for you this once, and let you into Wakefield\'s; won\'t\r\nwe, Ranger?  But it mustn\'t occur again."\r\n\r\nYet another peril awaited them before they were safe in port.  This time\r\nit was Mr Stratton on the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Ah, here you are--all of you," said he.  "I came to look for you.  I\r\nwant to hear how the shop is doing."\r\n\r\n"Very well, thank you, sir.  I say, Mr Stratton," said Wally, with a\r\npresence of mind which moved the admiration of his friends, "would you\r\nmind coming to a committee meeting in my and my chaps\' room!  We can\r\nshow you the things we want ordered next week, if you don\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"Certainly; I\'ll come.  I\'m delighted to find you\'re sticking so well to\r\nthe business."\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened that when at last Percy\'s door succumbed, and the\r\nbesiegers rushed in, vowing vengeance and slaughter, to find the room\r\nempty, the nine innocents were sitting prettily round the table in\r\nWally\'s room with Mr Stratton in the chair, deciding that until\r\nNovember was out it would be premature to order oranges for the\r\nFellsgarth shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nHAWK\'S PIKE.\r\n\r\nVictory has its drawbacks, like everything else.  The brilliant retreat\r\nof the Modern juniors and their auxiliaries under the enemy\'s fire was\r\nall very well as a strategic movement.  But when it came to deciding\r\nwhat to do next, the difficulties of the situation became painfully\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nMr Stratton stayed half an hour chatting over the shop affairs, and\r\nthen rose to go.\r\n\r\n"Good night, boys.  It\'s time for Mr Forder\'s boys to be back in their\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nThis unpleasant reminder had a very damping effect on the conviviality\r\nof the party generally.  As soon as the master had gone, Wally said--\r\n\r\n"It strikes me you Modern kids are in a bit of a mess."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid your bedroom will be a little untidy," said Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"The best thing you can do is to climb back by the window," suggested\r\nD\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t fancy you\'ll want a warming-pan to-night," said Ashby.\r\n\r\nThis was all very nice and helpful.  The heroes looked at one another\r\ndismally.\r\n\r\n"We must lump it," said Percy.  "They can\'t do anything very bad."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t they?" said Cottle.  "Were you ever licked by Brinkman?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the others.\r\n\r\n"All right--I have been--that\'s all."  This sounded alarming.  D\'Arcy\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come over to our side, and out that lot!  We could have\r\nno end of larks if you were Classics, instead of little Modern beasts."\r\n\r\n"Our side\'s as good as yours," snapped Lickford.  "All serene; you\'d\r\nbetter go and join them," said Wally.\r\n\r\nThis did not advance the argument much further.  Of course it was out of\r\nthe question to go and tell tales to the Classic prefects, or even to\r\ntheir own master.  Nor was the suggestion of sleeping that night on the\r\nClassic side hailed with enthusiasm by either party.\r\n\r\nOn the whole D\'Arcy\'s suggestion of getting back by the window seemed\r\nthe most hopeful.  When once back they would go straight to bed, where\r\nthey would be safe for a while.  Then, if they could manage to rise at\r\nthe supernatural hour of six, they might succeed in evading the\r\npenalties of rebellion for another day.  For to-morrow being exeat day,\r\nthey would be free to roam where they liked.  And they had a very good\r\nidea that wherever it was, they would give Forder\'s house a very wide\r\nberth.\r\n\r\n"Tell you what!" exclaimed Wally, slapping his brother on the back so\r\nhard as to cause him to yell loud enough to bring every prefect of\r\nFellsgarth on to the spot.  "Tell you what, old chappies; of course we\r\nwill!  Why ever didn\'t we think of it before--eh?"\r\n\r\n"Think of what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, we\'ll go up Hawk\'s Pike, of course."\r\n\r\n"Of course we will," said everybody.\r\n\r\nWhat mattered it to _them_ that Hawk\'s Pike had defied the ordinary\r\ntourist for generations?  _They_ weren\'t ordinary tourists, or anything\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n"You come over for us at six," said Wally.  "Bring the grub we left in\r\nyour room.  It\'ll be a regular sell for all those chaps.  We\'ll make a\r\nday of it."\r\n\r\nIt seemed a magnificent solution of the problem; and on the strength of\r\nit the five truants departed, not without misgivings, for their\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe rope was still dangling from their window, and Cash, whose father\r\nwas in the Navy, was selected by general consent as the member of the\r\nparty best qualified to make the first ascent.  He modestly tried to\r\ninduce some one else to assume the honour, but he was outvoted, and,\r\ndevoutly hoping to find the coast clear of the enemy, he addressed\r\nhimself to the venture.\r\n\r\nIt was not particularly arduous for a decent climber, and in a couple of\r\nminutes his companions saw him swing himself on to the ledge, and\r\ndisappear into the room.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he put out his head.\r\n\r\n"All clear," said he.  "The door\'s smashed in, and all the things kicked\r\nabout anyhow; but there\'s no one about."\r\n\r\nThat was the main thing.  The company speedily followed, materially\r\nassisted in their clamber by sundry knots tied in the rope by the\r\ningenious Cash, and by his energetic hauling from above.\r\n\r\nThe programme was carried out without a hitch.  Without waiting for the\r\nbed-bell they one and all presented themselves to the dormitory dame,\r\nand requested permission to turn in, pleading severe fatigue (which was\r\nby no means imaginary) as the reason for this unwonted haste.  So\r\nsmartly was the retirement effected, that no one was aware of their\r\nreturn to their house until half an hour later.  When the dormitory\r\nfilled up, their five noses were discernible peeping from out the\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nWhatever chastisement the prefects may have had in store for them\r\nevidently could not be administered at present.  For a disturbance in\r\nthe dormitory was a capital offence in Mr Forder\'s eyes, and, as the\r\nmaster\'s room was adjacent, and he was known to have returned and to be\r\nwithin earshot, the only thing possible was secretly to promise the\r\nrebels a warm time of it as soon as they woke next morning.\r\n\r\nBut Revenge sleeps sounder than Caution.  As five struck in the clock\r\ntower, Ramshaw, who had had it on his mind he might oversleep himself,\r\nand, in consequence, had been up looking at his watch every ten minutes\r\nduring the night, slipped finally out of bed, and roused each of his\r\npartners.  He expected no gratitude for his good offices, and was not\r\ndisappointed.  The sleepers growled and grunted at his well-meant\r\nefforts, pulled the clothes over their heads, called him unfriendly\r\nnames, threatened him with untold vengeance, and scouted all idea of\r\ndanger by delay, till he was almost tired of trying.  But by the end of\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, with the aid of a moist sponge and other\r\npersuasives, he got them to their feet well awake to a sense of the\r\nundertaking before them.\r\n\r\nThey still grumbled--at the cold, and the darkness, and the fatigue, and\r\nblamed Ramshaw for all three.  They heartily despised themselves for\r\ntheir promise to the Classic boys last night, and still more for the row\r\nwith their own prefects, which was the cause for all this inconvenience.\r\nBut as they gradually slipped on their clothes, and the warm bed\r\nreceded more into the background, they cheered up and recovered their\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nThere was no difficulty in getting out.  The dormitory door stood open.\r\nBrinkman, who was the prefect on duty, lay snoring loud and long in the\r\nend bed.  Mr Forder\'s bedroom was on the safe side of a brick wall.\r\nCarrying their boots in their hands they slunk off to their study, where\r\nthey made a hasty selection from the miscellaneous provisions stored\r\nover-night, and then, one by one, solemnly slid down the rope.\r\n\r\nOnce on the grass, in the chill, dark air, depression fell upon them a\r\nsecond time.  Their thoughts returned to the snug beds they had left.\r\nEven Brinkman and Clapperton could not take it out of them more than\r\nthis white frost and nipping air.  However, the bell began to toll six;\r\nand the thought of their companions in discomfort spurred them on to\r\nenergy.  They crawled across the Green to Wakefield\'s.\r\n\r\nFour ghostly figures were visible in the feeble dawn, hovering under the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n"Got the grub?"\r\n\r\nIt was the cheery voice of Wally Wheatfield, at sound of which the\r\npilgrims took comfort, and were glad they had turned out after all.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to get clear of Fellsgarth, which was easily\r\naccomplished, as no one was about.  Even had they been observed, beyond\r\nthe general wonder of seeing nine juniors taking a morning walk at 6\r\na.m., there was nothing to interfere with their liberty.  As soon as\r\nthey got into Shargle Woods a brief council of war was held.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a jolly stiff climb," said Wally.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a compass," said Ashby, as if that disposed of the difficulty.\r\nAshby had an ulster, which just then seemed to some of his comrades a\r\nstill more enviable possession.\r\n\r\n"How many miles?" asked Lickford.\r\n\r\n"Miles?  Who ever reckoned mountains by miles?  It\'s three hours to the\r\ntop."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be nine o\'clock," wisely observed Cash.\r\n\r\n"Who knows the way up?"  Percy asked.\r\n\r\n"Way up?  Can\'t you see it?" said Wally.  "When you get to the bottom,\r\nyou go straight up."\r\n\r\n"All very well for you.  I can\'t walk up a perpendicular cliff.  I dare\r\nsay I could come straight down if I tried," submitted Percy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there are lots of paths.  It\'s as easy as pot," said Wally.\r\n"Suppose we have a bit of grub now.  It\'ll be less to carry, you know."\r\n\r\nWhereupon an attack was made on the provisions, with the result that\r\nconsiderably less was left to carry up.\r\n\r\nThe meal ended, a start was made in earnest, and the party trailed down\r\nthe valley towards the lake at an easy jog-trot, and came to the\r\nconclusion that ascending a pike was ridiculously simple work.\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached the lake, and began to strike up the winding\r\nlane that led round to the rearward slopes of the great mountain, an\r\nhour had passed.\r\n\r\n"Nearly half-way there," said Fisher minor, hoping some one would\r\ncorroborate the statement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we don\'t count that bit we\'ve come anything," said Wally.  "We\'re\r\njust starting up now."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Fisher, again hoping to be confirmed.  "Then it\'s only two\r\nhours\' climb?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all you know about it.  Wisdom used to say he could do it in\r\nthree hours from the lake-side.  But he was a wonner to go.  Come along;\r\nwire in, you chaps."\r\n\r\n"Where did Wisdom get killed?" asked Percy, by way of a little genial\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"I heard over the other side, down the cliffs above the lake.  He got\r\ncaught in a mist and lost his way."\r\n\r\n"How do you know this is the right way up?" asked Cottle.\r\n\r\n"Because it\'s as plain as the nose on your face," retorted the guide.\r\n\r\nIt was a long dreary pull up the lower slope, over the wet grass and\r\nthrough the bracken, and Fisher minor before he accomplished the first\r\nstage was heartily sick of Hawk\'s Pike.  One or two of his companions,\r\nto tell the truth, were not quite as enamoured of the expedition as they\r\ntried to appear, but they kept their emotions to themselves.  Wally was\r\nthe only member of the party who was uniformly cheerful, and no one, not\r\neven Percy, exactly liked to incur his contempt by appearing to enjoy\r\nthe clamber less than he.\r\n\r\n"Come on, you chaps," cried the leader as he staggered to the top of the\r\nslope.  "Keep it up.  What a crow it will be for us, when we get to the\r\ntop!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose," gasped Fisher minor, as he threw himself on the grass,\r\n"we\'re half-way now?"\r\n\r\n"Getting on," said Wally.  "I dare say on the top of that next ridge we\r\nshall be able to see the top."\r\n\r\n"What, isn\'t that the top?" said poor Fisher, craning his head up\r\ntowards the beetling crag above them.\r\n\r\n"Top?  No, that\'s the knob half-way down we see from the school window.\r\nThe stiff part begins after that."\r\n\r\nReally Wally, if he had tried to be heartless, could not have succeeded\r\nbetter.  Had he but expressed some hint at regret that the distance was\r\nso long, or vouchsafed the least semblance of a growl at the labour\r\ninvolved, they would have loved him.  As it was, they durst do nothing\r\nbut hate him, and accept his information joyously.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nothing," said Lickford.  "I feel quite fresh; don\'t you, you\r\nchaps?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!" they chimed in plaintively.\r\n\r\n"Better get on," said Wally, after a few minutes more.  How they loathed\r\nWally then!\r\n\r\nThe new slope was worse than the first; for the grass was more boggy,\r\nand big stones here and there jarred their tender feet.  Besides, it\r\ngrieved them to see Wally zigzagging steadily on ahead, utterly\r\nregardless of their distress behind.  Yet no one exactly liked to stop.\r\nHad any one had the courage to do so, they would have gone down like a\r\nrow of ninepins.\r\n\r\nLet no one charge these boys with chicken-heartedness.  On the contrary,\r\nthey worked up that slope like heroes; all the more so that they were\r\nready to drop, and durst not for very shame.  There is no hero like the\r\ncoward who compels himself to be brave.  Many a man in history has\r\nbecome famous for an exploit that cost him far less than this climb cost\r\nthe Fellsgarth juniors.  Therefore let this record at least award the\r\nthe credit they deserve.--It was some satisfaction, when the knob was\r\nreached, and they looked up at the black towering crags above, to see\r\nthat even Wally seemed staggered for a moment.\r\n\r\n"We may as well have a rest and some grub before we tackle that lot,"\r\nsaid he.  "What do you say?"\r\n\r\nThe motion was carried unanimously.\r\n\r\n"It\'s eleven o\'clock," said Cash.  "We\'ve been five hours already."\r\n\r\n"Thank goodness we\'ve broken the back of it," said Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know so much about that," said Percy.\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t get up that as easily as we\'ve done so far, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"Rather not," said Wally, cheerfully, with his mouth full of sandwich.\r\n"I believe it\'s not so bad after we get past those rocks though, on to\r\nthe top."\r\n\r\n"What," cried Fisher, "isn\'t _that_ the top then?"\r\n\r\n"Bless you, no.  We have to go down a bit when we get there, and cross a\r\nbog, and then the real pike begins."\r\n\r\nThe information was received with dead silence, and the party sat grimly\r\nmunching their lunch with upturned eyes.\r\n\r\n"Which way do we go?" asked Cottle presently.\r\n\r\n"I suppose up by the stream.  It\'s bound to lead up to the bog."\r\n\r\nThe stream in question was a torrent which fell in a series of leaps\r\nthrough a narrow gorge in the rocks.\r\n\r\nFisher minor looked very blue.\r\n\r\n"I wish I\'d got my strong boots," said he.\r\n\r\nThe dismal tone in which he uttered the words startled the others.\r\n\r\n"I say, young Fisher," said D\'Arcy, "you\'re not done yet, are you!"\r\n\r\nFisher minor had not the pluck to say "Yes."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be game after this rest.  I got a little blown up that last bit,\r\nthat\'s all."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t look awfully far now," said Ashby.\r\n\r\n"It\'s further than it looks.  Come on; let\'s be jogging," said Wally.\r\n\r\nThe new ascent, which consisted chiefly in clambering from stone to\r\nstone up the rocky ravine, was less exhausting than the tramp up the\r\nbog, and as Wally was no better at this sort of climbing than any of the\r\nrest, he did not dishearten them by getting hopelessly ahead, but kept\r\nwith the party.  Occasionally they had to help one another up a\r\nspecially stiff ledge, and this mutual accommodation was an additional\r\nsource of comfort to the weak goers.  Progress was very slow.  Cash,\r\nhaving hauled himself up on to a little platform of moss, looked at his\r\nwatch and was alarmed to find it was past one.  The huge ravine, at the\r\nfar head of which they could see the open sky, seemed a tremendous\r\ndistance yet.  And after that, according to Wally, was to come the bog\r\nand the cliffs beyond, on which Wisdom lost his life.\r\n\r\nYet none of these things was quite so bad as the rolling up of some\r\nfleecy clouds behind them, which effaced the view below, and seemed to\r\nbe crawling up the mountain in pursuit of them.\r\n\r\nCash pointed this out to Wally, who grunted.\r\n\r\n"We shall miss the view from the top," said he.\r\n\r\n"If we ever get there," said Cash.\r\n\r\nOn they scrambled again, casting every now and then a longing look\r\nupward at the grim ravine head, and now and then an anxious glance\r\nbehind at the fast overhauling clouds.\r\n\r\n"We\'re bound to get out of it up there," sang out Wally.\r\n\r\nBut almost as he spoke the light mist swept past him, blotting out\r\neverything but the boulder he stood on and a rift of the dashing water\r\nat his feet.\r\n\r\nThe clouds had befriended Fisher minor.  They did what he durst not do;\r\nordered the party to halt.\r\n\r\n"Where are you?" shouted Wally from the invisible.  "Here; where are\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Stay there; and I\'ll come to you."\r\n\r\nSlowly the party foregathered, and stood huddled in the blinding mist on\r\na flat rock.\r\n\r\n"It\'s blowing over," said Wally.  "We\'d better make back for the hill-\r\nside, and get out of this ravine till it clears up."\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task scrambling back, down that difficult way, over\r\nboulders already made slippery by the moist mist, and not able to see\r\nfour yards ahead.  The clouds poured up to meet them in column upon\r\ncolumn, growing denser and wetter every minute.  At last, how they\r\nscarcely knew, they came down to where the rush of the water ceased and\r\nthe stones gave place to wet grass.\r\n\r\n"We must be somewhere near where we sat down last," said Ashby.  "Whew!\r\nit\'s cold."\r\n\r\n"The thing is," said Percy, "aren\'t we too much out to the left?\r\nThere\'s no sign of a path that I can see."\r\n\r\n"This looks like one," said a voice ahead, which they recognised as\r\nWally\'s.  "Come along--this way."\r\n\r\nThey followed as well as they could, and groped about for the path.\r\nThen they shouted.\r\n\r\nWally replied out of the mist.\r\n\r\n"Stay there a bit--it\'s not a path.  I\'ll yell when I\'ve got it."\r\n\r\nThey waited, and for five minutes listened anxiously for the signal.\r\nThen they thought they heard it away to the right, and floundered off in\r\npursuit.  But after a little they discovered that they were going\r\nuphill.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t we better go back to where we were," said Cash, "or we may miss\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to most of the party that they had missed him already.\r\nStill, they decided to go back.\r\n\r\nPresently they distinctly heard what sounded like a voice below them.\r\n\r\n"That must be he.  Yell!"\r\n\r\nThey shouted, and again there seemed to come a faint response.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Percy.  "Stay where you are, and I\'ll go and fetch him\r\nup."\r\n\r\nAnd he vanished into the mist.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the time?" said Ashby, as the party stood dismally waiting.\r\n\r\n"Half-past four.  It\'s a good job it doesn\'t get dark till six."\r\n\r\n"Only an hour and a half," said Cottle; "I wish those chaps would come."\r\n\r\nBut though they strained their ears and eyes, no sign of the missing\r\nones came; nothing but the swish of the rain and the whistle of the wind\r\nthrough the grass.\r\n\r\n"We\'d better go on," said D\'Arcy presently; "they\'ll probably get down\r\nsome other way.  Look sharp, or it will be dark."\r\n\r\nSo they started at a fast walk down the boggy slope.\r\n\r\n"Keep close," said D\'Arcy after a time.  "Are you all there?"\r\n\r\nEverybody answered for himself, but not for his neighbour.\r\n\r\n"You there, young Fisher minor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Fisher\'s voice from the rear.\r\n\r\nHe seemed so near that they started on again.\r\n\r\nBut after another five minutes, Ashby, who was last but one, shouted\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Where are you, Fisher minor?"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit, you fellows.  Fisher minor\'s behind."\r\n\r\nBut no answer came from that direction either.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a go," said Ashby to himself.  "That kid Fisher\'s gone lame, and\r\nhe\'ll be lost if I don\'t wait for him."\r\n\r\nSo he dismally turned back, shouting and whistling as he went.\r\n\r\nThe clouds all round grew duller and heavier in the fading light, and\r\nthe wind-blown rain struck keenly on the wanderer\'s cheek.\r\n\r\n"That kid," said Ashby to himself, as he sturdily tramped through the\r\nmarsh, "ought not to have come.  He\'s not up to it."\r\n\r\nBut despite all his shouting and whistling and cooeying, not a sound\r\ncame out of the mist but the wind and the driving of the rain.\r\n\r\nStill Ashby could not bring himself to leave the "kid" in the lurch.\r\nEven if he did not find him it would be better to--\r\n\r\n"Ah! what was that?"\r\n\r\nHe clapped his hands to his mouth and shouted against the wind with all\r\nhis might.\r\n\r\nHis voice was flung back in his face; but with it there came the feeble\r\nsound of a "coo-ey" somewhere near.\r\n\r\nAshby sprang to it like a drowning man to a straw.  If it was only a\r\nlost sheep it would be some company.  For ten minutes he beat round,\r\nshouting all the time, and once or twice fancying he heard an answer.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he came upon a great boulder, against which leaned Fisher\r\nminor, whimpering and shivering.\r\n\r\n"Here you are!" said Ashby, joyously.  "Thank God for it!  I gave you up\r\nfor lost.  The others are gone on.  Come on.  Hang on my arm, old hoss."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t; I\'m too fagged to go on.  I\'m awfully sleepy, Ashby.  You go\r\non; I\'ll come presently."\r\n\r\nAshby\'s reply was prompt and vigorous.  He took his fellow-junior by the\r\narm and began to march him down the slope as fast, almost faster than\r\nhis weary legs would carry him.\r\n\r\nAnd as they started, the last of the light died out of the mist, and\r\nleft them in blank darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nROLLITT MAKES A RECORD FOR FELLSGARTH.\r\n\r\nThe Modern seniors had slept on soundly that morning, secure of their\r\nprey.  The military operations of the preceding evening, although they\r\nresulted in the night of the besieged, had not tended to the glory of\r\nthe besiegers.  Indeed, when the door had at last been broken in and it\r\nwas discovered that the birds had flown, a titter had gone round at the\r\nexpense of Messrs. Clapperton, Dangle, and Brinkman, which had been\r\nparticularly riling to those gentlemen.\r\n\r\nWhen in the morning the birds were found to have flown once more, the\r\nposition of the seniors became positively painful.  Fullerton, as usual,\r\ndid not salve the wound.\r\n\r\n"I should say--not that it matters much to me--that that scores another\r\nto the rebels," said he.  "How very naughty of them not to stay and be\r\nwhopped, to be sure!"\r\n\r\n"The young cads!" growled Clapperton, who had the grace to be perfectly\r\naware that he had been made ridiculous.  "I don\'t envy them when I get\r\nhold of them."\r\n\r\n"No more do I," said Fullerton, "with their door off its hinges.  It\r\nwill be very draughty."\r\n\r\n"Do shut up.  Why don\'t you go and join the enemy at once, if you\'re so\r\nfond of them?" said Dangle.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Clapperton, "they will keep; but we must have it out with\r\nCorder now.  It\'s no use simply cutting him; he\'ll have to be taught\r\nthat he can\'t defy the house for nothing.  Go and tell him to come,\r\nBrinkman."\r\n\r\nBut Corder\'s back was against the wall, literally and metaphorically.\r\n\r\nTo Brinkman\'s demand (almost the first voice he had heard speaking to\r\nhim for a week) he returned a curt refusal.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll make you come," said Brinkman.  Whereupon Corder retreated\r\nbehind his table and invited the interloper to begin.\r\n\r\nTo dodge round and round a study table after a nimble boy is not a very\r\ndignified operation for a prefect, particularly when the object of his\r\nchase is a prefect too; and Brinkman presently abandoned the quest and\r\nwent off, breathing threatenings and slaughter, for reinforcements.\r\n\r\nSo did Corder.  Less sensitive than his junior fellow-martyrs, he\r\nmarched straight across to Yorke\'s study.  The captain was away, but in\r\nthe adjoining room he found Fisher major and Denton, poring over their\r\nendless accounts.\r\n\r\n"You two," said Corder, "you\'re prefects.  You\'re wanted over on the\r\nother side to stop bullying."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s being bullied?"\r\n\r\n"I am.  I\'ve been cut dead for a week.  I\'m sick of it.  Now they\'re\r\ngoing to lick me.  I\'d take my chance against them one at a time, but I\r\ncan\'t tackle three of them."\r\n\r\n"Is it for playing in the match?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that and going to the meeting.  Nothing else.  I\'d go to twenty a\r\nday, if I had the chance, to spite them."\r\n\r\n"Who are bullying you?"\r\n\r\n"Clapperton, Brinkman, and Dangle, of course."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Denton, "we couldn\'t go over.  We\'ve no\r\nauthority.  But there\'s nothing to prevent you staying here and letting\r\nthem fetch you.  Then we can interfere."\r\n\r\n"All serene," said Corder; "I hope they will come.  I say, I wish you\'d\r\nlet me wait here and hear you fellows talk.  I\'ve not had a word spoken\r\nto me for a week.  I can tell you it\'s no joke.  I laughed at it at\r\nfirst, and thought it would be nice rather than otherwise.  But after\r\ntwo days, you chaps, it gets to be decidedly slow; you begin to wonder\r\nif it isn\'t worth caving in.  But that would be _such_ a howling come\r\ndown, when all you\'ve done is to do what you had a right to do--or\r\nrather what you\'re bound to do--play up for the School."\r\n\r\n"And jolly well you played too," said Usher.\r\n\r\n"It was a lucky turn.  You know I was so awfully glad to be in the\r\nfifteen, and felt I could do anything.  Of course the lucky thing was my\r\ngetting past their forwards, and then--" And then Corder bunched into a\r\ndelighted account of the never-to-be-forgotten match, during which the\r\ncloud passed away from his face, the light came back to his eyes, and\r\nthe spirit into his voice.\r\n\r\n"What business have they to stop me," said he, "or bully me for it?"\r\n\r\n"None.  And Yorke, when he hears of it, will report it to the doctor."\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t let him do that.  What\'s the use?  If I can stay here it\'s\r\nall right."\r\n\r\nAn hour later, about the time that the young mountaineers were beginning\r\nto look out for their second wind on the lower slope, Dangle came across\r\nin a vicious temper.\r\n\r\nHe had not come to look for Corder, the sight of whom in the sanctuary\r\nof a Classic study took him aback.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where you\'re sneaking, is it?" said he.  "I\'m not surprised."\r\n\r\n"Not much need to sneak from _you_.  It\'s three against one I object\r\nto," said Corder.  "But if you like to fetch Clapperton and Brinkman\r\nover here, we can have it out comfortably now."\r\n\r\n"You must think yourself uncommonly important if you suppose we\'re going\r\nto trouble about an ass like you," said Dangle.  "I never once thought\r\nof you."\r\n\r\n"What have you come for, then?" said Fisher.  "Hadn\'t you better wait\r\ntill you\'re invited before you come where you\'re not wanted?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come on club business, and I\'ve a perfect right to come.  You\r\nfellows, I hear, have taken it into your heads to dissolve the club."\r\n\r\n"What of that?  Why didn\'t you come and vote against it if you didn\'t\r\nlike it?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  It wasn\'t quite good enough.  What I want to know is, what\r\nis the treasurer going to do with the money?  I suppose that\'s hardly\r\ngoing to be treated as a perquisite for him?"\r\n\r\nFisher major looked troubled.  He had dreaded this awkward question for\r\ndays.  For the lost money was still missing.\r\n\r\n"You know it\'s nothing of the kind."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do with it, then?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s for the club to decide.  If you\'d come to the meeting you could\r\nhave proposed something."\r\n\r\n"It\'s funny how sore you are about that precious hole-and-corner meeting\r\nof yours.  How much is there on hand?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll know presently."\r\n\r\n"I dare say--as soon as you\'ve hit on a dodge for getting over that\r\nlittle deficiency of four or five pounds--eh?"\r\n\r\nFisher major looked up in astonishment.  How had the fellow heard about\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nDangle laughed.\r\n\r\n"You thought it was a snug little secret of your own, didn\'t you?\r\nYou\'re mistaken.  And you\'re mistaken if you think we aren\'t going to\r\nget at the bottom of it."\r\n\r\nFisher major rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Dangle," said he; "do you mean to insinuate that _I\'ve_\r\ntaken the club money!"\r\n\r\n"I never said so."\r\n\r\n"Or that I was going to cook the accounts so that it should not be\r\nknown?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean _you_ were."\r\n\r\n"Whom did you mean?  Me?" said Denton.\r\n\r\n"No; I didn\'t say anybody," said Dangle, beginning to feel himself in a\r\nfix.  "All I meant was, we want to know what\'s become of the money?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want to know more than I do," said Fisher major.  "I\'d have\r\nhanded over the money days ago, if I could only have found it."\r\n\r\n"Do you suspect any one?" said Dangle.\r\n\r\n"Suspect?  No.  No one comes here that would be likely to take it."\r\n\r\n"You leave it about, though.  I\'ve noticed that myself.  Who\'s your\r\nfag?"\r\n\r\n"As honest a man as you, every bit, and that\'s saying a good deal for\r\n_you_," retorted Fisher major, hotly.\r\n\r\n"Keep your temper.  Who\'s study is that next yours?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s Yorke\'s."\r\n\r\n"No: on the other side."\r\n\r\n"That\'s Rollitt\'s.  I suppose you\'re going to insinuate--"\r\n\r\n"Stop a bit," said Dangle, suddenly, turning to close the door before he\r\nproceeded.  "When did you first miss the money?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re uncommonly interested in the accounts," said Fisher; "if you\r\nwant to know so much, it was ten days ago."\r\n\r\n"I\'m interested because I\'ve an idea.  When did you get in the\r\nsubscriptions?"\r\n\r\n"They were all in a week before the first Rendlesham match, the match\r\nwhere you--"\r\n\r\nFisher major stopped.\r\n\r\nDangle took no notice of the broken taunt, and said--\r\n\r\n"Look here, Fisher.  There\'s no love lost between you and me, and it\r\ndoesn\'t affect me."\r\n\r\n"Or me."\r\n\r\n"For all that, I don\'t care to see you or the clubs robbed without\r\ngiving you a friendly hint."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind.  Who is the culprit?  The doctor?"\r\n\r\n"No; _Rollitt_.  Stay," said he, waving down the interruption, "I\r\nshouldn\'t be fool enough to say it unless I was pretty sure.  Tell me\r\nthis, Fisher; when you go out and leave money about do you lock your\r\ndoor?"\r\n\r\n"No.  We don\'t have to do that this side."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see Rollitt in here?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Do you know that on the first half-holiday this term Rollitt nearly\r\ncame to grief on the river?"\r\n\r\n"What on earth has that to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Everything.  You heard of it?  Your young brother was with him, of\r\ncourse.  And you heard that he lost Widow Wisdom\'s boat over the falls."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Fisher, suddenly beginning to see the drift of the cross-\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n"And you heard that the very next day he bought her a new one for five\r\npounds?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did; but whatever right have you to connect that with the\r\nmissing money?"\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit.  You were away all that afternoon, weren\'t you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t.  I happened to come over to look for you, and found you were\r\nout.  The only fellow I met in the house was Rollitt.  He\'d just got\r\nback, and I met him at the door of this room.  There, you can make what\r\nyou like of it.  Even a Classic knows what twice two makes."\r\n\r\nAnd he turned on his heel and left the room.\r\n\r\n"There\'s goes a thoroughbred cad for you," said Denton.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how we came to let him go without a kicking," said Fisher.\r\n\r\n"Shall I call to him to come back?" asked Corder.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Fisher major, "it _is_ a curious coincidence about\r\nRollitt.  But I never thought of connecting the two things together\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"No.  It\'s utter guesswork on Dangle\'s part."\r\n\r\n"If it comes to that," said Corder, "if Dangle was over here that\r\nafternoon, why shouldn\'t he have collared it as well as Rollitt?"\r\n\r\n"He has any amount of money.  He\'s not hard up, like Rollitt."\r\n\r\n"All I can say is," said Denton, "I wish that cad had kept his\r\nsuspicions to himself."\r\n\r\nThe object of these suspicions, meanwhile, blissfully unconscious of the\r\ninterest with which he was being remembered at Fellsgarth, was utilising\r\nhis holiday in the prosecution of his favourite sport.\r\n\r\nThis time he did not fish from a boat, nor did he affect the upper\r\nstream.  He tried the lower reach; and not very successfully.  For he\r\nhad never been able to replace the tackle lost on the eventful afternoon\r\nwhen Widow Wisdom\'s boat had gone over the falls.  He had his fly-book\r\nstill, and had come across an old reel which, fitted to a makeshift rod\r\nwith common twine, had to do duty until he could afford a regular new\r\nturnout.  It was better than nothing, but the fish seemed somehow to get\r\nwind of the fact that they were not being treated with proper respect,\r\nand refused to have more to do than they could help with irregular-\r\nlooking apparatus.\r\n\r\nRollitt put up with their unreasonableness for a long time that morning\r\nand afternoon.  With infinite patience he tried one fly after another,\r\nand either bank in turn.  He gave them a chance of being hooked under\r\nthe falls, or right down on the flats by the lake.  But it was no go.\r\nThey wouldn\'t be tempted.\r\n\r\nAt last, as it was growing dusk, he became conscious that it had been\r\nraining fast for half an hour, and that he was wet through.  He looked\r\nup and saw a grim pall of wet lying over the lake and all up the side of\r\nHawk\'s Pike, of which only the lower slope was distinguishable through\r\nthe mist.  It was not a promising evening; and Rollitt, now he came to\r\nthink of it, might as well go back to Fellsgarth as stand about here.\r\n\r\nSo he collected his tackle and turned homeward.  His path from the lake\r\nbrought him across the track which leads round to the back of the\r\nmountain; and he was just turning in here when he heard what sounded\r\nlike a halloo on the hill-side.  It was probably only a shepherd calling\r\nhis dog, but he waited to make sure.\r\n\r\nYes, it was a shout, but it sounded more like a sheep than a man.\r\nRollitt shouted back.  A quick response came, and presently out of the\r\nmist a shadowy form emerged running down the slope, hopping over the\r\nboulders, and making for the lane.\r\n\r\nA minute more and Wally presented himself.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, is that you, Rollitt?  I thought I was lost.  I say, have you\r\nseen the others?"\r\n\r\nRollitt shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Whew!  I made sure they\'d come down.  I say, what a go if they\'re lost\r\nup there, a night like this?"\r\n\r\nRollitt looked up at the dim mountain-side and nodded again.\r\n\r\n"I thought I was on a path, you know, and hallooed to them.  They didn\'t\r\nhear, so I went back for them, and--so we\'ve missed."\r\n\r\n"Who!" said Rollitt.\r\n\r\n"Do you know my young brother Percy, a Modern kid?  He was one, and all\r\nour lot, you know, D\'Arcy and Ashby and Fisher minor and--"\r\n\r\n"Fisher minor," said Rollitt, suddenly becoming interested; "up there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--he\'s the lame horse of the party--not up to it.  What\'s up, I\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\nRollitt had suddenly deposited his rod under the wall, and quitting the\r\npath was beginning to strike up the base of the hill.\r\n\r\n"Go, and bring guides," he growled.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get lost, to a dead certainty.  I say, can\'t I come too?" said\r\nthe boy, looking very miserable.\r\n\r\n"No.  Fetch guides.  Come with them.  Quick."\r\n\r\nThere were no guides to be had nearer than Penchurch, four miles off,\r\nand Wally, very cold and wet and hungry and footsore, with a big load on\r\nhis heart as he thought of Percy, pulled himself together with an effort\r\nand stumped off.\r\n\r\nRollitt strode on up the slope in the gathering night.  Cold and weather\r\nmattered little to him, still less did danger.  But Fisher minor\r\nmattered very much.  For Percy or any of the rest he might probably have\r\nstayed where he was; but for the one boy in Fellsgarth he oared about he\r\nwould cheerfully go over a precipice.\r\n\r\nEvery now and again he stood still and shouted.  But in the wind and\r\nrain it was impossible to say if any one heard him or called again.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or more he found himself on the first ridge, where for a\r\nfew yards the ground is level before it rises again.  Here he called\r\nagain, once or twice.  Once there came, as he thought, a faint distant\r\nwhistle, but by no manner of calling could he get it to come again.  He\r\nstarted off in the direction from which it seemed to come, calling all\r\nthe way, but never a voice came out of the darkness.  For a couple of\r\nhours he doggedly haunted the place, loth to leave it while a chance\r\nremained.  Then he gave it up, and started once more up the steep slope.\r\nHe looked at his watch by the light of a match.  It was eleven o\'clock.\r\nHe shuddered, but not with the cold, and went on.\r\n\r\nSomething--who could say what?--told him that he must go higher yet.\r\nOnce last year, in company with Wisdom, he had been as far as the upper\r\nbog, and had wanted to go to the top.  But Wisdom had dissuaded him.\r\nNow, even in the darkness the ground seemed familiar, and he tramped on\r\nup the swampy steep till presently he found himself near the sound of\r\nrushing water at the foot of the great ravine.\r\n\r\nThe stream had grown so strong since the afternoon that to shout against\r\nit was more hopeless than ever.  Yet Rollitt shouted.  Had a voice\r\nreplied, he felt sure he could have heard it.  But none did.\r\n\r\nUp the steep ravine he went, finding the going easier than through the\r\nspongy swamps below.  About half-way up, just where the juniors ten\r\nhours ago had decided to turn back, as he looked up, he saw what seemed\r\nlike clear sky through a frame in the mist.  Was it clearing after all?\r\nYes.  The higher he got the more the mist broke up into fleeting clouds,\r\nwhich swept aside every few moments and let in a dim glimmer of\r\nmoonlight on the scene.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the ravine he shouted again; but all was still.  Even the\r\nwind was dying down, and the rain fell with a deadened sob at his feet.\r\nThree o\'clock!  Wisdom had told him, the day they had been up there,\r\nthat the top was only three-quarters of an hour beyond where he stood.\r\nSomething still cried "Excelsior" within him, and without halting longer\r\nthan to satisfy himself by another shout, he started on.\r\n\r\nHow he achieved that tremendous climb he could never say.  The clouds\r\nhad rolled off, and the moonlight lit up the rocks almost like day.\r\nNever once did he pull up or flag in his ascent.  He even ceased to\r\nshout.\r\n\r\nPresently there loomed before him, gleaming in the moonlight, the cairn.\r\nFor the first time in its annals, a Fellsgarth boy had got to the top\r\nof Hawk\'s Pike.\r\n\r\nBut, so far from elation at the glory of the achievement, Rollitt\r\nuttered a groan of dismay when he looked round and found no one there\r\nafter all.  That he would find Fisher minor there he had never doubted;\r\nand now--all this had been time lost.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to heed the glorious moonlight prospect over lake and\r\nhill, he turned almost savagely, and scrambled down the crags.  It was\r\nperilous work--more perilous than the scramble up.  But Rollitt did not\r\nthink of danger, and therefore perhaps did not meet it.  In half an hour\r\nhe was down on the bog--and in an hour after, just as a faint break in\r\nthe east gave warning that the night was gone, he stood bruised and\r\npanting at the foot of the gorge on the second ridge.\r\n\r\nHe was too dispirited to shout now.  It had not been given to him after\r\nall to rescue his friend.  He would have done better if he had never--\r\n\r\nThere was a big boulder just ahead, poised almost miraculously on its\r\nedge, on the sloping hill-side.  It looked as if a moderate blast of\r\nwind would send it headlong to the bottom.  But it had stood there for\r\ncenturies, a shelter for sheep in winter from the snow and hail.\r\n\r\nWhat made Rollitt bound now in the direction of this rock, like a man\r\nshot?  Surely not to admire a natural curiosity, or to seek shelter\r\nunder its wing.\r\n\r\nNo.  He had found that his quest after all had not been in vain.  There,\r\ncurled up under the overhanging rock, lying one almost across the other\r\nfor warmth, with cheek touching cheek, and Ashby\'s coat covering both,\r\nwere Fisher minor and his chum--not dead, but sleeping soundly!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nCORDER STRIKES A BLOW FOR LIBERTY.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the juniors had excited no curiosity in either house till\r\nevening.  It was a holiday, and though the rule was that even on a\r\nholiday no boy should go "out of touch," as it was called, that is,\r\nbeyond a certain radius, without permission, it was not always enforced.\r\nThe Modern seniors had every reason to guess the object of this\r\nprolonged absence.  They had promised many things to the juniors when\r\nthey caught them.  It was not surprising, while things were as warm as\r\nthey were, that the young rebels should give Fellsgarth a wide berth.\r\n\r\nAs to the Classic juniors, no one was surprised at anything they did, in\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nBut when "call-over" came and all nine names were returned absent (in\r\naddition to that of Rollitt and a few other habitual vagrants), fellows\r\nbegan to ask where they were.\r\n\r\n"Has any one seen Wally?" asked Yorke, who had just had the unusual\r\nexperience of making his own tea and cooking his own eggs.\r\n\r\n"He\'s probably fooling about somewhere out of bounds with my fag," said\r\nRanger.  "He\'ll have to catch it, Fisher, though he is your brother."\r\n\r\n"Let him have it," said Fisher.  "I\'d do the same to your young brother\r\nif I had the chance.  But to change the subject, I\'ve something to tell\r\nyou fellows that\'s rather awkward.  That money hasn\'t turned up yet."\r\n\r\n"That is awkward," said Yorke.  "I wish I could help you out with it,\r\nbut I\'m cleaned out."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s not it.  Of course I\'m responsible, and must get the\r\ngovernor to make it good.  Dear old governor, he\'ll do it, but he\'ll\r\npull a precious long face, and go round the house lowering the gas and\r\ntelling every one he must economise, with two such expensive sons as me\r\nand my minor at school.  It\'s not that, though.  Dangle came over this\r\nmorning, and wanted to know what we were going to do about the accounts,\r\nnow we\'ve dissolved the clubs; and somehow or other he\'s heard of the\r\ndeficiency, and wants to know all about it."\r\n\r\n"I hope you told him," said Yorke.\r\n\r\n"Of course I did; but he told me a lot more than I could tell him.  He\r\nthinks he knows what\'s become of it."\r\n\r\nAnd Fisher proceeded to narrate Dangle\'s suspicions against Rollitt.\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s face grew very long as the story went on.  Then he said--\r\n\r\n"I hope to goodness there\'s nothing in it.  Is it a fact about Widow\r\nWisdom\'s boat?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; my young brother was with Rollitt that day, and told me about it\r\nas a secret.  But as it\'s out now, there\'s no good keeping it."\r\n\r\n"Dangle has a spite against Rollitt.  If any one else had told you this,\r\nthere might have been something in it."\r\n\r\n"And if it had been any one but Rollitt bought the boat, it would have\r\nbeen nothing.  But he\'s so frightfully poor.  He\'d no time to write\r\nhome, even if he could have got money from there, and there was no one\r\nhere he could borrow of.  Why, he must have gone off very first thing in\r\nthe morning and bought the boat."\r\n\r\n"And are you quite certain you had all the money collected by that\r\nSaturday?" asked Yorke.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and what\'s more, I\'m almost certain I counted it and made it come\r\nright.  That\'s the last time it has come right."\r\n\r\nThe captain drummed his fingers on the table and looked very miserable.\r\n\r\n"I wish, Fisher," said he, "I hadn\'t advised you to take that\r\ntreasurership.  If we could only be quite sure there wasn\'t some mistake\r\nin the accounts, it would be different.  It would be a frightful thing\r\nto suspect Rollitt unless it was absolutely certain."\r\n\r\n"You\'re welcome to round on me," said Fisher, looking quite as miserable\r\nas his chief.  "I was a fool to take your advice.  I\'d much sooner make\r\nthe money up myself, and not say a word about it to any one."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do that now.  You may be sure Dangle won\'t let it drop."\r\n\r\n"What shall you do?" asked Ranger.\r\n\r\n"What would _you_ do?" said Yorke, testily.  "Isn\'t it bad enough to be\r\nin a fix like this without being asked hopeless questions?  I\'m sorry,\r\nold man, I\'ve lost my temper; and as it\'s not come back I vote we say no\r\nmore on the subject at present."\r\n\r\nThe evening wore on, and still the truants did not return.  At ten\r\no\'clock Yorke reported their absence to Mr Wakefield, and Mr Wakefield\r\nreported it to the head-master.  A similar report reached him from the\r\nmatron of Mr Forders house with regard to the missing ones there; and\r\npresently, further report was made that Rollitt was not in the school.\r\n\r\nNo one could give any account of their probable whereabouts.  Rollitt\r\nhad been seen going out with a rod early in the day, but no one had seen\r\nany of the juniors since last night, when they had prematurely gone to\r\nbed in their own dormitory.  A consultation was held, in which all sorts\r\nof conjectures were put forward, the most plausible of which was that\r\nthe juniors had organised an expedition to Seastrand, a fashionable\r\nwatering-place an hour distant on the railway, which both Wally and\r\nLickford had separately been heard to express a desire to visit.  It\r\nseemed probable that they had lost the last train back, and would\r\nliterally "not come home till morning."\r\n\r\nIn which case warm things were promised to be ready for my gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAs to Rollitt, his vagaries were consistent with any explanation.  He\r\nmay have gone to Penchurch in mistake for Fellsgarth, and curled himself\r\nup in the church porch, mistaking it for his bed.\r\n\r\nIn any case the general impression was that nothing could be done till\r\nmorning, and that the juniors at least were making themselves pretty\r\ncomfortable, wherever they might be.\r\n\r\nStill, Fisher major felt a vague uneasiness.  Had he been quite sure his\r\nbrother was in the capable company of his fellow-fags, he would have\r\nbeen comparatively comfortable.  But the possibility of the feckless\r\nyoungster wandering about benighted somewhere on his own account added a\r\nnew weight to the burden which already lay on the spirit of the luckless\r\ntreasurer of the School clubs.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a good mind to turn out and look for my minor," said he to Denton.\r\n\r\n"What could you do?  He\'s all right.  You couldn\'t do anything in the\r\ndark, and on a night like this.  I\'m game to turn out any hour you like\r\nin the morning, if he\'s not come by then.  I bet you the four young\r\nscamps will all stroll in for call-over, and wonder whatever the fuss\r\nwas about."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done, and Fisher lay awake all night, listening\r\nto every sound, and reproaching himself over and over again (as one will\r\ndo when everything goes wrong) that he had made such a mess of\r\neverything this term.\r\n\r\nAbout daybreak there came a ring at the school-bell, and half the school\r\njumped to its feet.  Fisher was down on the Green among the first, in\r\nslippers and ulster.\r\n\r\nFive shivering youngsters were standing inside the gate, with dripping\r\ngarments and chattering teeth and white faces--D\'Arcy, Lickford,\r\nRamshaw, Cottle, and Cash--but no Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s my minor?" asked the senior.\r\n\r\n"What! hasn\'t he turned up?" said D\'Arcy.  "Haven\'t Wally and Percy and\r\nAshby turned up?  We got lost on Hawk\'s Pike.  I\'m awfully hungry, I\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"No one\'s turned up.  Do you mean to say he\'s out on the hill a night\r\nlike this?"\r\n\r\n"He was behind--he and Ashby.  He was a lame duck, you know.  The others\r\nwere in front."\r\n\r\n"Were they together?"\r\n\r\n"Who?  Young Fisher minor and Ashby?  I don\'t think so."\r\n\r\n"Ashby yelled to see if we knew where he was, and must have gone to look\r\nfor him.  We made sure they\'d be back long ago, didn\'t we, you chaps?"\r\n\r\nHere the doctor and several of the prefects came on the scene.  The\r\ntruants were ordered to the hot bath and bed at once, and a council was\r\nheld as to what should be done.  Fisher major did not wait to take part\r\nin it.  He rushed to his room, flung on his clothes and boots, and\r\nstarted off, accompanied by Denton, at full speed, in the direction of\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\nNeither spoke a word.  As they passed Widow Wisdom\'s, Denton darted in.\r\n\r\n"Have your fire alight and some food ready.  Some of our youngsters have\r\nbeen all night on the mountain.  We\'re going to look for them."\r\n\r\nHalf-way to the lake, they were pulled up by a shout from across the\r\nstream.  It was Percy Wheatfield, dead beat, sitting on a log, as white\r\nand miserable as a ghost.\r\n\r\n"I say, have you chaps seen Wally?" he called.\r\n\r\n"No; we\'re off to look.  Some of them have turned up.  Can you get as\r\nfar as Widow Wisdom\'s?  There\'s a roaring fire and some grub waiting\r\nthere.  We\'ll see after Wally."\r\n\r\nPercy staggered to his feet.  He had been wandering, he could not say\r\nwhere, all night.  The very mention of the words "fire" and "food"\r\nrevived him.\r\n\r\n"Get up to school as soon as you can and get to bed.  You can\'t be any\r\nuse looking for the rest.  There\'s plenty of us to do that.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\nIt was half-past seven when they reached the lake and turned up the\r\nmountain path.  The mist had vanished, and the late autumn sun was\r\nshining brightly on the hill-side.  The distant barking of a dog above\r\napprised them that some one was abroad already, and the hopes of the\r\nsearchers rose within them as they struck up the steep slope.\r\n\r\nHalf-way up they stood and shouted; but no reply came except the far-\r\naway barking of the shepherd\'s dogs.  "We shall be able to see a good\r\nway all round when we get on to the ridge," said Denton.\r\n\r\nAlmost as he spoke, a shout close by startled them.  Looking up they\r\nperceived emerging from behind some boulders a little procession.\r\n\r\nFisher major\'s blood ran cold as he saw it.  For at the head stalked a\r\nstalwart guide, who carried in his arms one small boy, while in the rear\r\nfollowed a form which they recognised as Rollitt\'s carrying on his back\r\nanother.  Between the two tramped a third junior, hanging on to the arm\r\nof another guide.\r\n\r\nWhat terrified Fisher major more than anything was to see that the head\r\nof the boy on Rollitt\'s back had fallen helplessly forward on the\r\nshoulder of his porter.\r\n\r\nWith a groan the elder brother bounded to the spot.  The history of\r\nyears flashed through his mind as he did so.  He saw the people at home\r\nand heard their voices.  He seemed to be in the nursery, hectoring it,\r\nas big brothers will, among the little ones, amongst whom was a little\r\nboy with curly hair and a shrill piping voice.  He called to mind the\r\nfirst-night of this term, and the vision of his young brother breaking\r\ndown with his new-boy troubles next morning.  All this and more fleeted\r\nthrough his mind as he bounded to where Rollitt stood.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said the latter, almost gruffly.  "Asleep."\r\n\r\nSo he was.  It had scarcely roused him when Rollitt had picked him up\r\ntwo hours ago from his roost under the rocking-stone.  And having once\r\nbeen perched on his preserver\'s back his head fell forward again, and\r\nthere it had lain ever since.  How Rollitt had carried him so far,\r\nresting only now and then, and that in a way not to disturb his burden,\r\nonly those who knew the huge strength of the Fellsgarth giant could\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n"Hullo," said Wally, greeting the new-comers in a limp, sleepy way,\r\n"have you seen my young brother Percy?  He was--"\r\n\r\n"Yes--Percy\'s all right; so are all the rest."\r\n\r\n"I\'m all right," sang out Ashby from the front.  "This chap wanted to\r\ncarry me, so I let him."\r\n\r\n"Jolly glad you were to get the lift," said Wally.  "You new kids\r\noughtn\'t to have come.  Twenty-four hours on the hills is nothing when\r\nyou get used to--"\r\n\r\nHere Wally (who had had twenty-six hours) suddenly collapsed and tumbled\r\nover from sheer fatigue on the grass.\r\n\r\nFisher and Denton made a chair of their hands for him, and so the\r\nprocession went on.\r\n\r\nA cart was in waiting at the foot of the slope, filled with warm wraps\r\nand other restoratives, and in less than two hours the whole party was\r\nsafe inside the walls of Fellsgarth.\r\n\r\nHot baths, blankets, food, and a little physic, succeeded in a very few\r\ndays in restoring the invalided truants to their sorrowing class-mates.\r\nFisher minor was the only member of the party about whom any serious\r\nuneasiness existed, and he, thanks to a wiry constitution and a rooted\r\ndislike to do what nobody else did, got off with a bad cold, which\r\ndetained him in his house for a fortnight.\r\n\r\nRollitt, as might have been expected, vanished to his own quarters as\r\nsoon as he had deposited his precious burden into Mr Wakefield\'s\r\ncharge.  No one heard of his having been to the top.  To Fisher\'s thanks\r\nhe returned a grumpy "Not at all."  And the curious inquiries of others\r\nhe met by shutting his door and saying "Get out" to any one who entered.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected also, the Modern seniors were baulked, after all,\r\nof their promised vengeance on the rebels.  On the contrary, while the\r\nfags were making merry on chicken and toasting their toes at the roaring\r\nfire in the sanatorium, Clapperton, Brinkman, and Dangle were hauled up\r\ninto the presence of the head-master, and there seriously reprimanded\r\nfor the damage done to one of the doors in Mr Forder\'s house, and\r\ncautioned not to let such a breach of discipline happen again, under a\r\npain of severer penalties.\r\n\r\n"If you are unable to keep order in your own house," said the doctor\r\ncuttingly, "your duty is to report the matter to me, and I will deal\r\nwith it.  Remember that another time."\r\n\r\nThis incident did not tend to smooth the ruffled plumes of the\r\ndiscomfited heroes.\r\n\r\nStill less did another little rebuff, which happened a few days later.\r\n\r\nCorder had taken advantage of the general excitement attending the\r\nescapade of the juniors to return to his own quarters and attempt once\r\nmore to resume the privileges of ordinary civilised life.  He only\r\npartially succeeded.  Two or three boys, among whom was Fullerton, who\r\nwere getting sick of the present state of affairs and longing for\r\nfootball once more, had begun seriously to doubt what advantage was\r\ncoming to themselves or any one else by the strike.  Among these Corder\r\nfound a temporary shelter.  But the authority of the seniors still\r\ncontrolled the general public opinion of the house, and the life of the\r\nboycotted boy was still only half tolerable.\r\n\r\nAt the first attempt at violence, however, Corder walked across to his\r\nClassic allies, and took up his quarters in their study, where he\r\nremained all day.\r\n\r\nAt bedtime he declined to return to his own house; particularly when a\r\nsummons to that effect was sent across by Clapperton, who by this time\r\nhad a very good idea of the rebel\'s whereabouts.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going over," said Corder.\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t stay here all night," said Denton.\r\n\r\n"What shall you do--turn me out?" asked the fugitive.\r\n\r\n"No.  But you\'d better go, and if you don\'t like the look of things out\r\nthere, you\'d better speak to Forder."\r\n\r\n"No.  I\'d sooner stop," said Corder, doggedly.  "I\'m sorry to put you\r\nfellows about after your being so kind, but I\'m not going over there."\r\n\r\nYorke was consulted, and took upon himself the responsibility of\r\ndetaining the refugee for the night.\r\n\r\n"All right, thanks," said Corder, and turned in.\r\n\r\nNext morning word came from Mr Forder requiring that the truant should\r\nanswer for his absence.\r\n\r\nCorder obeyed, with some misgivings, and explained briefly that he had\r\nbeen bullied and did not want to stand it.\r\n\r\nMr Forder, who had a peculiar faculty for saddling the wrong horse, was\r\nnot satisfied with this explanation, and chose to suspect some other.\r\nCorder had never been a satisfactory boy.  He had probably been making\r\nhimself objectionable, and had been glad of an excuse to break rules.\r\nThe master did not demand particulars.  He gave the culprit an\r\nimposition, and ordered him to obey the rules of his house; and another\r\ntime, if he had any grievance, to come with it to him instead of taking\r\nthe law into his own hands.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Corder departed in high dudgeon.\r\n\r\nIt was no use holding out now.  He had better give in, and own himself\r\nbeaten.  It would be so much easier than resisting any longer.\r\n\r\nFor an hour of two he was permitted to go in and out unmolested.  But\r\nafter morning school, he was going out to solace himself with some\r\nsolitary kicks at the football, when just on the steps of the house\r\nBrinkman pounced upon him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got you now, have I, you cad?" said he.  "You just come back with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t.  Let go!" cried Corder, in a temporary panic, wriggling\r\nhimself away and escaping a few yards.\r\n\r\nBrinkman, however, was quickly after him, determined this time to hold\r\nhim fast.  Corder, though a senior, was a small boy, and had never\r\nbefore thought of pitting, himself against the Modern bully.\r\n\r\nBut once already this term he had come suddenly to realise that he could\r\ndo better than he gave himself credit for.  And now that matters seemed\r\ndesperate, when there was no escape, and his fate stared him in the\r\nface, it occurred to Corder he would show fight.\r\n\r\nHe had right on his side.  He had done no harm to Brinkman or anybody\r\nelse.  Why shouldn\'t he let out, and stand up for himself?\r\n\r\nSo, to Brinkman\'s utter amazement, he was met by a blow and a defiant\r\nchallenge to "come on."\r\n\r\nWhat Brinkman might have done is doubtful, but at that moment Yorke and\r\nRanger strolled by.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!  What\'s this?  A fight?" said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Rather," said Corder, now thoroughly strung up to the point.  "I say,\r\nYorke, will you stop and see fair play?"\r\n\r\nThe captain hesitated a moment.  Any other fight he would have felt it\r\nhis duty to stop.  This fight seemed to be an exception.  It would\r\nprobably do more good than harm.\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you like," said he.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to fight a little beggar like that," said Brinkman.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are," said Ranger, "and I\'ll see fair play for you."\r\n\r\n"I promise you I\'ll make it so hot for him that he\'ll be sorry for it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," said Corder.  "If you don\'t fight you\'re a coward.\r\nThere!"\r\n\r\nAt this point Dangle came out.\r\n\r\n"Here, your man wants a second," said Ranger; "you\'ll suit him better\r\nthan I."\r\n\r\nThe usual crowd collected, minus the junior faction, who complained\r\nbitterly for a year after that they had been deliberately done out of\r\nbeing present by the malice of the principals.  One result of their\r\nabsence was that the proceedings were comparatively quiet.  Every one\r\npresent knew what the quarrel was, and not a few, for their own sakes,\r\nhoped Corder would make a good fight of it.\r\n\r\nDangle sneered at the whole thing, and counselled his man audibly not to\r\nbe too hard on the little fool.\r\n\r\nHis advice was not wanted.  Corder, for a fellow of his make and\r\ninexperience, exhibited good form, and persistently walked his man round\r\nthe ring, dodging his blows and getting in a knock for himself every now\r\nand then.  Brinkman soon dropped the disdainful style in which he\r\ncommenced proceedings, and became proportionately wild and unsteady.\r\n\r\n"Now\'s your chance, young \'un; he\'s lost his temper," whispered the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Corder, hardly knowing how he managed it, danced his man once\r\nmore round and round, till he was out of breath, and then slipped in\r\nwith a right, left--left, right, which, though they made up hardly one\r\ngood blow among them, were so well planted, and followed one another so\r\nrapidly, that Brinkman lost his balance under them, and fell sprawling\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Mr Stratton came up, and the crowd dispersed as if\r\nby magic.\r\n\r\n"What is this?" said the master, appealing to the captain.\r\n\r\n"A fight, sir," said Yorke.  "A necessary one."\r\n\r\n"Between Corder and Brinkman?  Come and tell me about it, Yorke."\r\n\r\nSo while Corder, amid the jubilations of his supporters, who had grown\r\ntwenty-fold since the beginning of the fight, was being escorted to his\r\nquarters, and Brinkman, crestfallen and bewildered, was being left by\r\nhis disgusted backers to help himself, Yorke strolled on with Mr\r\nStratton, and gave him, as well as he could, an account of the\r\ncircumstances which for weeks had been leading up to this climax.\r\n\r\n"I think it was as well to allow it," said the master, "but there must\r\nbe no more of it.  You have a hard task before you to pull things\r\ntogether, Yorke, but it will be work well done."\r\n\r\n"Was it the right thing to dissolve the clubs, sir?" asked Yorke.\r\n\r\n"At the time, yes.  But watch your chance of reviving them.  You must\r\nhave some common interest on foot, to bring the two sides together."\r\n\r\nThe captain walked back to his house in a brown study.  He had half\r\nhoped Mr Stratton might offer to interpose and restore the harmony of\r\nthe School.  But no, the master had left it to the captain, and Yorke\'s\r\ncourage rose within him.  God helping him, he would pull Fellsgarth\r\ntogether before he left.\r\n\r\nOn the Green he met Fullerton.  It was long since the Modern and Classic\r\nseniors had nodded as they passed, but in the curious perversity of\r\nthings both did so now.\r\n\r\n"There\'s been a fight, I hear?" said Fullerton.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Brinkman and Corder.  Corder had the best of it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m jolly glad.  Corder\'s got more pluck than you\'d give him credit\r\nfor."\r\n\r\n"Yes; he\'s had a rough time of it in your house."\r\n\r\n"So he has, poor beggar.  It\'s rather humiliating to wait till he has\r\nlicked his man before one takes his side; but upon my word, I\'m as sick\r\nof it all as he is."\r\n\r\n"It is rather rough on fellows who aren\'t allowed to do what they\'ve a\r\nright to do," said Yorke.  "I say, have you anything special on after\r\nafternoon school?"\r\n\r\n"No, why?"\r\n\r\n"Only that I wish you\'d come and have tea with me."\r\n\r\nFullerton laughed.\r\n\r\n"Bribery and corruption?" said he.  "Anyhow, I\'ll come."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\n"FAMA VOLAT."\r\n\r\nThe Modern seniors had certainly experienced a run of bad luck since the\r\ninauguration of the strike, which was to have brought their rivals down\r\non their knees and secured for the Modern side a supremacy in\r\nFellsgarth.\r\n\r\nThe second Rendlesham match, the defection of Corder, the mutiny of the\r\njuniors, the disbanding of the clubs, the row with the head-master, and\r\nfinally, the defeat of Brinkman by his own victim, might be held to be\r\nenough to chasten their spirits, and induce them to ask themselves\r\nwhether the game was worth the candle.\r\n\r\nBut, such is the infatuation of wrong-headedness, they still breathed\r\nvengeance on some one; and this time their victim was to be Rollitt.\r\n\r\nThe grudge against him had been steadily accumulating during the term.\r\nHis outrage on the gentle Dangle was yet to be atoned for.  His crime of\r\nplaying in the fifteen was yet unappeased.  His contempt of the whole\r\ncrew of his enemies was not to be pardoned.  Even his rescue of the lost\r\njuniors told against him, for it had helped to turn the public feeling\r\nof the School in favour of those recalcitrant young rebels.  So far\r\nthere had been no getting at him.  He would not quarrel.  He would not\r\neven recognise the existence of any one he did not care for.\r\n\r\nBut now a chance had come.  The more they discussed it, the more morally\r\ncertain was it that he was answerable for the disappearance of the money\r\nfrom the Club funds.  The very reluctance of his own house to take\r\naction in the matter showed that they at least appreciated the gravity\r\nof the suspicion.\r\n\r\nIt was a trump card for the Moderns.  By pushing it now, they would be\r\ndoing a service to the School.  They would pose as the champions of\r\nhonesty.  They would be mortifying the Classics, even while they\r\npretended to assist them; and, above all, they would wipe out scores\r\nwith Rollitt himself, in a way he could not well disregard.\r\n\r\nClapperton and Dangle were not superlatively clever boys; but, whether\r\nby chance or design, they certainly hit upon an admirable method for\r\nbringing the matter to a crisis.\r\n\r\nDangle took upon himself to confide his suspicions, as a dead and\r\nterrible secret, to Wilcox, a middle-boy of Forder\'s house, and\r\nnotorious as the most prolific gossip in Fellsgarth; who, moreover, was\r\nknown to have several talking acquaintances in the other houses.\r\n\r\nWilcox received Dangle\'s communication with astonishment and--oh, of\r\ncourse, he wouldn\'t breathe a word of it to any one, not for the world;\r\nit was a bad business, but it was Fisher major\'s business to see it put\r\nright, and so on.\r\n\r\nThat night as Wilcox and his friend Underwood were retiring to rest, the\r\nformer confided to the latter, under the deadliest pledge of secrecy,\r\nthat there was a scandal going on about the School accounts.  He\r\nmightn\'t say more except that the fellow suspected was one of the last\r\nhe himself should have dreamt of, although others might be less\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nThat was not all.  Next morning he sat next to Calder, a Classic boy, in\r\nHall, and asked him if he could keep a secret.  Oh yes, Calder could\r\nkeep any amount of secrets.  Then Wilcox told him the same story that he\r\nhad confided to Underwood, only adding that the amount in question was\r\nsaid to be several pounds.\r\n\r\nCalder hazarded the names of several boys; but Wilcox shrugged his\r\nshoulders at them all.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better not ask me," he said; "it will only get out and make\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"Oh! but I promise I wouldn\'t tell a soul," said Calder.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you, though.  But I\'ll tell you this.  You\'d never guess\r\nthe fellow had had as much in his pocket all his life."\r\n\r\n"What--do you mean Rollitt?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you, I say.  I\'m not at liberty to mention names."\r\n\r\nThe rumour thus admirably started went on merrily.\r\n\r\nBefore nightfall it was known in half a dozen Modern studies that the\r\nClub funds had been robbed of L10 or L12 by a Classic boy, and that he\r\nwas being shielded by his own seniors.  On the Classic side four or five\r\nfellows whispered to one another that Rollitt had been caught in the act\r\nof stealing money out of Fisher major\'s rooms a day or two ago.\r\n\r\nPresently, one enterprising gossip sent the story of Widow Wisdom\'s boat\r\nrolling in and out with the rumour of the stolen money.  Encouraged by\r\nthat, some one else hinted that there had been deficiencies last term as\r\nwell as this; and in and out with the new story was started the report\r\nthat last term Rollitt had set up with a fishing-tackle and book of\r\nflies worth ever so much.\r\n\r\nA couple of days later the number of boys in the secret had multiplied\r\nfast, and Rollitt, as he walked across the Green to Hall or class, was\r\nwatched and pointed out mysteriously by a score or more of curious boys.\r\n\r\nOf course the story grew to all sorts of curious shapes.  Percy (who was\r\nthe first of the invalided juniors to appear in his usual haunts) had it\r\nfrom Rix, who had had it from Banks, who had had it from Underwood, who\r\nhad had it from Wilcox, who had had it from Dangle, who had been present\r\non the occasion, that Rollitt had met the head-master in a lane near\r\nWidow Wisdom\'s, and holding a pistol at his head had made him turn out\r\nall his pockets, and relieved him of fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nPercy said he didn\'t believe it.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Rix reduced the amount to thirty pounds.\r\n\r\nPercy still could not accept the story.\r\n\r\nWhereat Rix, anxious to meet his friend as far as possible, substituted\r\na walking-stick for the pistol.\r\n\r\nStill Percy\'s gullet could not swallow even what was left.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Rix suggested that it was open to doubt whether it was the\r\ndoctor who was robbed or Fisher major.  It _might_ have been the latter.\r\n\r\nStill Percy looked sceptical.\r\n\r\nWhich called forth an explanation that Rix did not mean to say that\r\nDangle actually witnessed the occurrence; but that he knew it for a fact\r\nall the same.\r\n\r\nPercy shook his head still.\r\n\r\nAnd Rix, feeling much injured, laid the scene of the outrage in Fisher\'s\r\nstudy, and conceded that the money might belong to the clubs, and might\r\nbe only five pounds.\r\n\r\nPercy had the temerity once more to express doubt.  Whereupon Rix flatly\r\ndeclined to come down another penny in the amount, or alter his story\r\none iota, with one possible exception; that the money may have been\r\ntaken when Fisher major was not in his room.\r\n\r\nPercy considered the anecdote had been boiled down sufficiently for\r\nhuman consumption, and grieved Rix prodigiously by saying that he knew\r\nall about it weeks ago, and what did he mean by coming and telling him\r\nhis wretched second-hand stories?\r\n\r\nHowever, whatever variations the rumour underwent as it passed from hand\r\nto hand, it managed to retain its three most salient points all\r\nthrough--namely, that Fisher major had been robbed; that the money taken\r\nbelonged to the club; and that the suspected thief was Rollitt.\r\n\r\nFor a week or two Rollitt remained profoundly ignorant of the charges\r\nagainst him.  His unapproachable attitude was the despair both of friend\r\nand enemy.  Yorke, who would have given anything to let him have an\r\nopportunity of denying or explaining the charge, was at his wits\' end\r\nhow to get at him.  Dangle, on the contrary, who was chiefly interested\r\nin the penalties in store for the thief, was equally at a loss how to\r\nbring him to bay.\r\n\r\nHe would see no one.  He shut himself in his study and fastened the\r\ndoor.  In class and Hall he was practically deaf and dumb; and in his\r\nsolitary walks by the river it was as much as any one\'s comfort for the\r\nwhole term was worth to accost him.\r\n\r\nBy one of those strange coincidences which often bring the most unlikely\r\npersons into sympathy, Yorke and Dangle each decided to write what they\r\nhesitated to say.\r\n\r\nYorke had endless difficulty over his letter.  He could not bring\r\nhimself to believe Rollitt a thief, yet he could not deny that\r\nsuspicions existed.  Still less could he evade his duty as captain to\r\nsee things right.  The latter duty he might have put off on Mr\r\nWakefield or the doctor.  But the mere reporting to them of the\r\ncircumstances would fix the suspicions on Rollitt more pointedly than\r\nthey were already, and certainly more pointedly than Yorke wished them\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n"Dear Rollitt," he wrote, "I hope you will not resent my writing to tell\r\nyou of a rumour which is afloat very injurious to you, and one which I\r\nfeel quite sure you can dispose of at once.  I would not write about it,\r\nonly I am very anxious for the sake of everybody you should deny it, and\r\nso shut up others who would be glad enough if it were true.  A sum of\r\nmoney, about L4 10 shillings, belonging to the Club funds has been lost\r\nfrom Fisher major\'s room.  The rumour is that you have taken it, and\r\nthose who accuse you make much of the coincidence that about the time\r\nwhen the money was said to be lost, you spent a similar sum in the\r\npurchase of a new boat for Widow Wisdom.  If I didn\'t feel quite sure\r\nyou would be able to deny the charge and explain anything about it that\r\nseems suspicious, I should not have cared to write this.\r\n\r\n"Yours truly,--\r\n\r\n"C.  Yorke."\r\n\r\nDangle\'s letter was less ingenuous.\r\n\r\n"The secretary of the Fellsgarth clubs has been requested to ask Rollitt\r\nthe following questions in reference to a sum of about L4 10 shillings\r\nmissing from the funds in the treasurer\'s hands.\r\n\r\n"1.  Is it true that Rollitt was seen at the door of Fisher major\'s room\r\non Saturday afternoon, September 21, at a time when everybody else was\r\nabsent from the house?\r\n\r\n"2.  Is it true that immediately afterwards Rollitt paid five pounds for\r\na new boat for Widow Wisdom?\r\n\r\n"3.  Where did that money come from?\r\n\r\n"4.  Does Rollitt know that he is suspected by every boy in Fellsgarth\r\nof having stolen it; and that now that the clubs are dissolved the\r\ntreasurer will be called upon to refund the money?\r\n\r\n"5.  What is Rollitt going to do?  Does he deny it?  If not, will he\r\ntake the consequences?\r\n\r\n"Signed for the Club Committee,--\r\n\r\n"T.  Dangle, Sec."\r\n\r\nFisher minor, the only boy to whom a missive to the School hermit might\r\nsafely be entrusted, was on his way to Rollitt\'s study with the\r\ncaptain\'s note in his hand, when he was met on the stairs by Cash.\r\n\r\n"What cheer, kid?" said the latter.  "Where are you off to?"\r\n\r\n"Taking a letter to Rollitt," said Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I am, from Dangle.  I say, you may as well give him\r\nthe two.  No answer.  Ta-ta."  And he thrust his missive into Fisher\'s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIt was just as easy to hand Rollitt two letters as one.  So Fisher\r\nproceeded on his errand.\r\n\r\nRollitt was writing a letter, which he hurriedly put aside when the\r\nmessenger entered.\r\n\r\n"Get out!" he said, looking up.  But when he saw who the intruder was\r\nhis tone relaxed a little.\r\n\r\n"Fisher minor?  Better?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, thanks.  I had a cold, but that was all.  I say, Rollitt, you were\r\nan awful brick helping us down that night."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said Rollitt, pulling out his paper and going on writing.\r\n\r\n"Here are two letters for you," said the boy.\r\n\r\nRollitt motioned him gruffly to lay them down on the table and depart--\r\nwhich he did gladly.\r\n\r\nRollitt went on writing.  It may be no breach of confidence if we allow\r\nthe reader to glance over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mother,--You ask me if I am happy, and how I like school.  I am\r\nnot happy, and I hate Fellsgarth.  Nobody cares about me.  It\'s no use\r\nmy trying to be what I am not.  I am not a gentleman, and I hope I never\r\nshall be, if the fellows here are specimens.  Just because I\'m poor they\r\nhave nothing to do with me.  I don\'t complain of that.  I prefer it.\r\nI\'d much sooner be working for my living like father than wasting my\r\ntime at a place like this.  If those ladies would give the money they\r\nspend on keeping me here to you and father it would do much more good.\r\nThere is only one boy I care about here, and he is a little fellow who\r\nwas kind to me of his own accord, and doesn\'t fight shy of me because\r\nI\'ve no money and live on charity.  I would ever so much rather come and\r\nlive at home at the end of this term.  It would be even worse at Oxford\r\nthan it is here; and the ladies, if they want to be kind, will let me\r\nleave.  I know you and father want me to become a grand gentleman.  I\r\nwould a hundred times rather be what I really am, and live at home with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n"Your loving son,--\r\n\r\n"Alfred."\r\n\r\nThis dismal letter concluded, the writer produced his books and began\r\nwork, heedless of the two letters on his table, which lay all day where\r\nFisher minor had deposited them.\r\n\r\nHe went in and out to class, and those who watched him saw no signs of\r\ntrouble in his demeanour.  In the afternoon he stole up to the river\r\nwith his rod; and any one who had seen him land his three-pounder, and\r\nleave it, as he left all his fish, at Widow Wisdom\'s cottage, would have\r\nbeen puzzled by his indifferent air.\r\n\r\nThat evening, as he was about to go to bed, he discovered the letters.\r\n\r\nDangle\'s letter, which he opened first, he scarcely seemed to heed.  The\r\nsight of the name at foot was sufficient.  He crumpled it up and tossed\r\nit in the corner.\r\n\r\nBut Yorke\'s aroused him.  He read it through once or twice, and his face\r\ngrew grim as he did so.  Presently he went to the corner and picked up\r\nDangle\'s letter and once more read it.  Then he crumpled up both\r\ntogether, and instead of going to bed sat in his chair and looked at the\r\nwall straight in front of him.\r\n\r\nThe next day those who watched him saw him go into school and out as\r\nusual, except that he seemed less listless and more observant.  He\r\nglanced aside now and then at the groups of boys who stood and looked\r\nafter him, and his face had a cloud on it which was almost thunderous.\r\n\r\n"Did you give my letter to Rollitt?" said Yorke to Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yesterday; and one from Dangle too," said the junior.\r\n\r\n"Dangle!" said the captain to himself; "he\'ll think we are in collusion.\r\nWhy ever didn\'t I leave it alone?"\r\n\r\nHe felt thus still more when later on in the day Dangle came over.\r\n\r\n"I hear you have written to Rollitt for an explanation.  It was about\r\ntime.  What does he reply?"\r\n\r\nYorke\'s back went up at the dictatorial tone of the inquiry.\r\n\r\n"If there is anything to tell you, you will hear," said he.\r\n\r\n"That means he hasn\'t replied, I suppose.  I have taken care that he\r\nshall reply.  I have told Forder all about it."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve told Forder?  You cad!" exclaimed Yorke, in a tone which made\r\nDangle thankful he was near the door.\r\n\r\n"Yes," snarled he.  "It may be your interest to shield a thief, but it\'s\r\nnot in the interest of Fellsgarth.  You won\'t take the matter up; Forder\r\nwill.  I\'ve told him you know about it, and will give him all the\r\nparticulars.  Hope you\'ll enjoy it."\r\n\r\nAnd he disappeared, only just in time for his own comfort.\r\n\r\nYorke\'s rage was unbounded.  Of all the masters, Mr Forder was the one\r\nhe would least have chosen to take up an affair of this kind.  He was\r\nharsh, unsympathetic, hasty.  And of all persons to prime the master in\r\nthe circumstances of the case, Dangle was the least to be trusted.\r\n\r\nHis temptation was to go at once to Rollitt, and force the matter to a\r\nconclusion before Mr Forder had time to interfere.  Things were going\r\nfrom bad to worse.  Would they never come right again?\r\n\r\nNext morning, before he could decide what to do, a message came from Mr\r\nForder, requesting him and his fellow-prefects to come across to the\r\nmaster\'s room.\r\n\r\nIn no amiable frame of mind they obeyed.  As they expected, Clapperton,\r\nBrinkman, Dangle, and Fullerton were also present.\r\n\r\n"This is a most serious case," said Mr Forder.  "Yorke, I understand\r\nyou know more about it than any one.  Will you kindly say all you know?"\r\n\r\n"I know nothing," said the captain, "except that I believe the story is\r\ngroundless."\r\n\r\n"That is unsatisfactory.  In a matter like this, there must be nothing\r\nlike sheltering the wrong-doer."\r\n\r\n"It\'s because we were afraid of that, sir," said Clapperton, "that we\r\nthought it right to tell you about it."\r\n\r\n"Of course.  Fisher major, perhaps you will tell us about the missing\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\nFisher major briefly related his loss and the efforts he had made to\r\ndiscover it.\r\n\r\n"And what are your grounds for suspecting Rollitt?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suspect him, sir; or rather I should not if it were not for\r\nwhat Dangle has said about him."\r\n\r\nThereupon Dangle was called upon to repeat his accusation.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said the master, "we require two important witnesses\r\nto make the case clear.  I believe Mrs Wisdom is in the house at\r\npresent.  Will you inquire, Fullerton, and if so, tell her to come here?\r\nAnd will you, Fisher major, fetch your brother?"\r\n\r\nAfter a painful delay, in which the rival seniors sat glaring at one\r\nanother, and the master made notes of the evidence so far, the two\r\nwitnesses were forthcoming.\r\n\r\nWidow Wisdom had nothing to say except in praise of Master Rollitt, and\r\nwas glad enough in support of it to relate the incident of the boat, and\r\neven produce the receipt, which she carried about like a talisman in her\r\npocket.  She had no idea that her glowing testimony was to be used\r\nagainst her favourite, or she would have bitten off her tongue sooner\r\nthan give it:\r\n\r\nAs for Fisher minor, confused and abashed in the presence of so many\r\nseniors, he blundered out his story of the eventful half-holiday,\r\nlooking in vain towards his brother to ascertain if he was doing well or\r\nill.  He blabbed all he knew about Rollitt; the condition of his study,\r\nthe nature of his solitary walks, the poverty of his possessions--\r\neverything that could possibly confirm the suspicions against him; and\r\nforgot to mention anything which might in the least avail on the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the court-martial Mr Forder summed up.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it is a very clear case," said he.  "It is very painful to\r\nthink that a Fellsgarth boy should come to such a pass.  The matter must\r\nbe reported to the head-master.  But before doing so it would be fair to\r\nsee Rollitt, and hear what he has to say.  We have no right to condemn\r\nany one unheard.  If he is innocent, it will be easy for him to prove\r\nit.  Fisher major, will you tell him to come?"\r\n\r\nFisher major reluctantly obeyed.  It was nearly half an hour before he\r\nreturned, and then he came alone.\r\n\r\n"I cannot find Rollitt, sir.  He is not in the house.  He was absent\r\nfrom morning call-over.  And the house-keeper says he was not in his\r\nroom this morning, and that his bed was not slept in last night."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nBOLTED!\r\n\r\nHowever slowly the rumour of Rollitt\'s dishonesty had spread through the\r\nSchool, the news of his disappearance spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nMr Forder\'s desire to keep the matter from being talked about was\r\neminently futile, for Wally and Percy Wheatfield both knew all about it\r\nfive minutes after Fisher major had discovered the absence of the\r\n"suspect."\r\n\r\nBy everybody except a very few infatuated persons, such as Yorke and\r\nFisher minor, Rollitt\'s flight was taken as conclusive evidence of his\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\n"If he hadn\'t done it, why shouldn\'t he stay and face it?" asked\r\nClapperton.\r\n\r\n"The wonder to me is," sneered Dangle, "that he brazened it out as long\r\nas he did."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you were in his shoes," said Yorke, "suspected by every one,\r\nwith the evidence black against you, and Dangle in charge of the\r\nprosecution, how would you like it?"\r\n\r\n"If I\'m in charge of the prosecution," said Dangle, colouring up, "it\'s\r\nbecause _you_, whose duty it was to see the matter put right, were doing\r\nall you could to shield the scoundrel."\r\n\r\n"I did nothing because I didn\'t believe him guilty, and I don\'t yet,"\r\nsaid the captain hotly; "and if you call him scoundrel again in my\r\nhearing, I\'ll knock you down."\r\n\r\n"Keep your temper," said Dangle, glad, all the same, that there were one\r\nor two fellows between him and the captain.  "_You_ may not care about\r\nthe credit of Fellsgarth.  We do."\r\n\r\n"You!" retorted Yorke, with such withering contempt that Dangle half\r\nwished he had left the matter alone.\r\n\r\n"The thing is," said Ranger, "what is to be done!"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Yorke.  "Forder has gone to tell the doctor all about\r\nit.  They\'ll take it into their own hands to hunt him down--perhaps with\r\nDangle\'s assistance.  All we\'ve got to do is--"\r\n\r\nHere Fullerton interrupted--\r\n\r\n"--is to say all the evil we can about a fellow who is down and can\'t\r\ndefend himself."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with Fullerton?" said Clapperton, with a sneer;\r\n"surely he\'s not become one of Rollitt\'s champions?"\r\n\r\n"If it matters specially to you what I think," said Fullerton, "I don\'t\r\nbelieve a word of your precious story.  First of all, Fisher major\'s\r\nsuch a fool at accounts that it\'s not at all certain the money is lost;\r\nsecondly, Dangle is the accuser; thirdly, Rollitt is the accused;\r\nfourthly, because if a similar charge were made against me, I should\r\ncertainly disappear."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha!" snarled Brinkman, "they\'ve got hold of poor Fullerton, have\r\nthey?  I wish them joy of him."\r\n\r\n"Thanks very much," said Fullerton; "I don\'t intend to desert the dear\r\nModerns.  You will have a splendid chance of taking it out of me for\r\ndaring to believe somebody innocent that you think guilty.  I shall be\r\nhappy to see any three of you, whenever you like, I can hit out as well\r\nas young Corder, so I hope Brinkman won\'t come.  But Dangle now, or even\r\nClapperton, I shall be charmed to see.  It\'s really their duty as\r\nprefects to suppress any one who dares have an opinion of his own.  I\r\nsimply long to be suppressed!"\r\n\r\nThis astounding revolt for the time being diverted attention from the\r\ntopic of the hour.  The laughter with which it was greeted by the\r\nClassics present did not tend to add to the comfort of Clapperton,\r\nBrinkman, and Dangle, who very shortly discovered that it was time to go\r\nto their own house.\r\n\r\n"Wait for me," said Fullerton; "I\'m coming too."\r\n\r\nAnd, to their disgust, the rebel strolled along, with his hands in his\r\npockets, in their company, whistling pleasantly to himself and\r\nabsolutely ignoring their unfriendly attitude.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the question, "Where is Rollitt?" continued to exercise\r\nFellsgarth, from the head-master down to the junior fag.  Bit by bit all\r\nthat could be found out about his movements came to light.  His study\r\nwas visited by the masters.  It disclosed the usual state of grime and\r\nconfusion.  His fishing-rod and tackle were there.  There had been no\r\nattempt to pack his few belongings, which lay scattered about in dismal\r\ndisorder.  The photograph of the pleasant, homely-looking woman on the\r\nmantelpiece, with the inscription below, "Alfred, from Mother," stood in\r\nits usual place.  His Aristophanes lay open in the window-sill at the\r\nplace for to-day\'s lesson.  Everything betokened an abrupt and hasty\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nAmong the papers on his table was a fragment of some accounts recording\r\nthe outlay of little more than a few pence a week since the beginning of\r\nthe term.\r\n\r\nWhen inquiry came to be made, it was found that he was last seen after\r\nafternoon class yesterday, when he unexpectedly went to the School shop\r\nand purchased from the attendant there (who had been put in charge of\r\nthat establishment during the indisposition of the managing directors)\r\nhalf a dozen Abernethy biscuits.\r\n\r\nThe matron at Wakefield\'s remembered that only a day or two ago a parcel\r\nhad arrived for Rollitt--another unusual circumstance--containing a ham.\r\nOf this possession no sign was now to be found in his study.\r\n\r\nThe inference from all these circumstances of course was, that however\r\nabruptly he had departed, he had not gone home, but somewhere where food\r\nwould not be easy to procure in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nMessengers were sent to Penchurch to acquaint the police and inquire at\r\nvarious places on the way for news of the missing boy.  But no one had\r\nseen him "out of touch" for several days--since his last fishing\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nHis home address was of course on the School books, and thither a\r\ntelegram was sent.  But as the place was beyond the region of the wire,\r\nno reply came for a day, when in answer to the doctor\'s inquiry if the\r\nwanderer had returned home, there came an abrupt "No."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the doctor had had another conference with the seniors of both\r\nhouses, and inquired with every sign of dissatisfaction into the merits\r\nof the suspicions which were the apparent cause of Rollitt\'s\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\nTo his demand why the matter was not reported to him, Yorke replied that\r\nas far as he and Fisher major were concerned they did not suspect\r\nRollitt, and therefore had had nothing to report.  The Modern seniors,\r\non the other hand, put in the plea that they had looked to the Classics\r\nto take the matter up, and when they declined to do so, had reported the\r\nmatter to Mr Forder.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor went into the particulars of Dangle\'s feud with the\r\nmissing boy, much to the embarrassment of the former.\r\n\r\n"He insulted you by turning you out of Mr Wakefield\'s house, you say.\r\nWhy were you there?"\r\n\r\n"I went to speak to some juniors."\r\n\r\n"About what?"\r\n\r\n"Clapperton wanted them--"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t.  You went--" interrupted Clapperton.\r\n\r\n"Silence, Clapperton.  What were they wanted for, Dangle?"\r\n\r\n"They had cheated at Elections."\r\n\r\n"What was your object, then?"\r\n\r\n"To punish them."\r\n\r\n"Are you not aware that the captain of the School is the only prefect\r\nwho is allowed to punish?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, but--"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"We were not sure that their own prefects were going to take any notice\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"I caned all four of them for it, and you saw me do it," said Yorke.\r\n\r\n"Humph.  And as to Rollitt, how came he to be present?" asked the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n"He came in."\r\n\r\n"What were you doing when he came in?"\r\n\r\n"There was a scuffle."\r\n\r\n"You were striking those boys?  What did Rollitt do?  Did he strike\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"What then?"\r\n\r\n"He--he," said Dangle, flushing up to be obliged to record the fact in\r\nthe presence of the other seniors, "he dragged me across the Green."\r\n\r\n"Then you say he attacked you on another occasion on the football\r\nfield?"\r\n\r\nAnd Dangle had to stand an uncomfortable cross-examination on this\r\nincident too.\r\n\r\n"What had it all got to do with Rollitt?" asked every one of himself.\r\n\r\n"I ask you all these questions, Dangle," said the doctor, when he had\r\nbrought this chapter of history up to date, "because it seems to me you\r\nare Rollitt\'s chief accuser in this matter.  I wish I were able to feel\r\nthat you were not personally interested in your charges proving to be\r\ntrue.  That, of course, does not affect the case, as far as Rollitt is\r\nconcerned.  The evidence against him is merely conjecture, so far."\r\n\r\n"But I met him at Fisher\'s door that afternoon," said Dangle, determined\r\nto make the most of his strong points.\r\n\r\n"Why," said Fisher, "you told me you didn\'t know which my door was, when\r\nyou first spoke about it."\r\n\r\n"I found out since, and it was the same door."\r\n\r\n"Was he coming out of the room or going in!"\r\n\r\n"Coming out."\r\n\r\n"You are sure of that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I remember because the door nearly struck me as he opened it."\r\n\r\n"However could it do that!" exclaimed Fisher.  "My door opens inwards!"\r\n\r\nDangle coloured up with confusion and stammered--\r\n\r\n"I--I thought it--I suppose I was wrong."\r\n\r\n"I think so," said the doctor frigidly.  "Thank you, boys, I needn\'t\r\nkeep you longer at present."\r\n\r\n"You idiot!" said Clapperton, as he and the discomfited Dangle walked\r\nback to Forder\'s.  "You\'ve made a precious mess of it, and made the\r\nwhole house ridiculous.  Why couldn\'t you let it alone?  You\'ve mulled\r\neverything you\'ve put your finger into this term."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Clapperton," said Dangle, in a white heat, "I\'ve stood a lot\r\nfrom you this term--a jolly lot.  I\'ve done your dirty work, and--"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?  What dirty work have I asked you to do?"\r\n\r\n"Plenty that you\'ve not had the pluck to do yourself."\r\n\r\n"I dare you to repeat it, you liar!"\r\n\r\n"You shall do your own in future, I know that."\r\n\r\n"Dangle, hold your tongue, you cad!"\r\n\r\n"I shall do nothing of the kind, you snob!"\r\n\r\nWhereupon ensued the most wonderful spectacle of the half, a fight\r\nbetween Clapperton and Dangle.  It was nearly dark, and no one was\r\nabout, and history does not record how it ended.  But in Hall that night\r\nboth appeared with visages suspiciously marred, and it was noted by many\r\nan observant eye that diplomatic relations between the two were\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nBut while old friends had thus been falling out on Rollitt\'s account,\r\nold enemies had on the same grounds been making it up.\r\n\r\nThe juniors having recovered of their colds, and finding themselves once\r\nmore in the full possession of their appetite, their liberty, and their\r\nspirits, celebrated their convalescence by a general _melee_ in Percy\'s\r\nroom, under the specious pretext of a committee meeting of the shop-\r\ndirectors.  This business function being satisfactorily concluded, they\r\nturned their attention to the condition of things in general.\r\n\r\nThat Fellsgarth should have got itself into a regular mess during their\r\nenforced retirement caused them no surprise.  What else could any one\r\nexpect?\r\n\r\nBut that any one should dare to suspect and make things hot for a fellow\r\nwithout consulting _them_, caused them both pain and astonishment.  It\r\nquite slipped their memories that not long since some of them had been\r\nglad enough to listen to disparaging talk about the School hermit.  That\r\nwas a detail.  On the whole they had stuck to him, and they meant to\r\nstick to him now!\r\n\r\nMany things were in his favour.  He had won a goal for the School.  He\r\nhad dispensed with his right to a fag, and had let the juniors of all\r\ngrades generally alone.  He was on nodding terms with Fisher minor, one\r\nof their lot.  He had come up Hawk\'s Pike at much personal inconvenience\r\nto look for them.  And he had been a customer to the extent of six\r\nAbernethys at the School shop.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons (which were quite apart from party considerations)\r\nit was decided _nem. con_. that Rollitt was a "good old sort" and must\r\nbe stuck by.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the nine of them sallied out arm in arm across the Green, on\r\nthe look-out for some one who might hold a contrary opinion.\r\n\r\nAfter some search they found a Modern middle-boy, who, catching sight of\r\nFisher minor, shouted, "How now!  Who nobbled the Club money?" which\r\nmade Fisher minor suddenly detach himself from his company, and\r\nshouting, "That\'s him!" start in pursuit.  What a bull-dog it was\r\ngetting, to be sure!\r\n\r\nThe whole party joined in the hue-and-cry, and might have run the\r\nfugitive down, had not the head-master stalked across the Green at that\r\nmoment on his way to Mr Wakefield\'s.\r\n\r\nAt sight of him they pulled up short, looked unutterably amiable, doffed\r\ntheir caps, and made as though they were merely out to take the air on\r\nthis beautiful November afternoon.\r\n\r\nTo Fisher minor the interruption was a sad one.  That fellow was the\r\nborrower of his half-crown; for weeks he had lost sight of him.  Now,\r\nsuddenly, chance had seemed to bring both man and money within reach,\r\nwhen, alas! the Harpy swooped down and took off the prize from under his\r\nvery nose.\r\n\r\nThe doctor having passed, they continued their search for any one who\r\nhad a bad word to say for Rollitt.\r\n\r\nBut as it was nearly dark, and rain was falling, the craven maligners\r\nkept indoors, and would not be caught.\r\n\r\nSo the juniors relieved themselves by giving three cheers for Rollitt\r\nunder every window round the Green, and then fell to abusing Fisher\r\nminor because his brother, Fisher major, had lost the money which\r\nRollitt was said to have stolen.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt that kid\'s at the bottom of it," said Percy.  "First\r\nof all, he\'s a Classic cad."\r\n\r\nHere the speaker was obliged to pause, on a friendly admonition from the\r\nboot of his brother Wally.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a Classic kid," continued he.\r\n\r\n"You said cad."\r\n\r\n"I said cad? do you hear that, you chaps?  Thinks I don\'t know how to\r\nspell."\r\n\r\n"You said he was a Classic cad."\r\n\r\n"There you are; you\'ve said it now.  Kick him, you chaps.  How dare he\r\nsay he\'s a Classic cad?" said Percy.\r\n\r\nThis verbal squabble being settled at last, Percy proceeded to explain\r\nFisher minor\'s position.\r\n\r\n"If he hadn\'t come to Fellsgarth, Rollitt would have been smashed to\r\nbits over the falls.  And if Rollitt had been smashed to bits--"\r\n\r\n"He couldn\'t have bought six Abernethys at the shop," suggested D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"Right you are!  And what\'s more, he couldn\'t have eaten them if he had,\r\nand he couldn\'t have run away.  There you are, I said this kid was at\r\nthe bottom of it."\r\n\r\n"But who\'d have collared the money in that case?" asked Ashby.\r\n\r\nPercy reflected.  This was a decided point.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see," said he, "it\'s this way.  If young Fisher minor hadn\'t\r\nbeen born, he wouldn\'t have had a governor and a mater, and if he hadn\'t\r\nhad a governor and a mater, no more would Fisher major.  And if Fisher\r\nmajor hadn\'t had a governor and a mater he\'d never have been elected\r\ntreasurer, and if he\'d not been elected treasurer he wouldn\'t have lost\r\nthe money.  So you see the young un\'s at the bottom of it again."\r\n\r\n"I know a shorter way than that," said D\'Arcy.  "If young Fisher minor\r\nhadn\'t fetched Rollitt up to vote that day, Fisher major wouldn\'t have\r\nbeen elected, and then he couldn\'t have lost the money."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that what I said?" said Percy, indignant to be thus summarily\r\nparaphrased.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to lick me for being born?" inquired Fisher minor.\r\n\r\n"Good mind to.  It\'s all your fault good old Rollitt\'s gone."\r\n\r\n"Those six Abernethys won\'t last him long," suggested Cash.\r\n\r\n"No.  We must keep a stock of them now, and call them `Rollitt\'s\r\nparticular.\'  I fancy they might fetch three-halfpence each."\r\n\r\n"I say," said Wally, "I vote we find Rollitt.  He\'s not a bad sort, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"All very well," said Percy, "if one only knew where to look."\r\n\r\n"It\'s my notion he\'s either gone home or to the top of Hawk\'s Pike.  I\r\ndon\'t well see where else he could be."\r\n\r\n"London?" suggested Cottle.\r\n\r\n"Not got the money."\r\n\r\n"Walked there?"\r\n\r\n"Not got the boots."\r\n\r\n"He can\'t be hanging about near here.  Everybody knows him.  No; you bet\r\nhe\'s gone to the top of Hawk\'s Pike, and he\'s going to stay there till\r\nthe clouds roll by."\r\n\r\nThis brought up a painful reminiscence.  None of the party, except\r\nWally, exactly favoured the idea of another attempt on the great\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n"Tell you what," said Percy, "those biscuits will last him over to-\r\nnight.  We\'ll see if there\'s any news of him in the morning, and if not\r\nwe\'ll organise an expedition to find him.  I say, let\'s go and have\r\nanother shop committee somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose we have it in Rollitt\'s study.  He was a jolly good sort, you\r\nknow.  It would please him."\r\n\r\nThe logic of this proposition did not detain the meeting.\r\n\r\nThey decided to go in the usual way.  That is, the four Classic boys\r\nboldly marched into their house together, and the five Moderns dropped\r\nin one by one artlessly and quite by accident.\r\n\r\nAs Fisher minor passed his brother\'s door he thought he would just look\r\nin.  At the same moment the house matron, with a very important face,\r\nwas bounding into the room.\r\n\r\n"Master Fisher," said she, "Mrs Wisdom\'s just sent back that flannel\r\nshirt of yours."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  At last.  She\'s only had it six weeks.  About long enough," said\r\nFisher major.  "I\'d given it up for lost."\r\n\r\n"It got left at the bottom of the bag, and she never noticed it till\r\nlast night.  And what do you think, Master Fisher! there was _this_ in\r\nthe breast pocket."  And she handed him a little brown paper parcel.\r\n\r\nFisher major snatched at it with an ejaculation more like horror than\r\nanything else, and tore the paper open.\r\n\r\nFour sovereigns and some silver dropped on to the table.\r\n\r\n"Why," gasped he, "that\'s it!  I remember now.  I got it on the field\r\njust before the Rendlesham match, and stuck it in that pocket, and it\r\nwent clean out of my head.  Oh, my word, what _have_ I done?  What an\r\nawful mess I\'ve made!"\r\n\r\nNot even Fisher minor stayed to dispute this statement, but hurried off\r\nwith the great news to the shop committee next door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nCOMING TO.\r\n\r\nFisher major\'s discovery put the finishing touch to the discomfiture of\r\nthe Modern seniors.\r\n\r\nAnd the manner in which they came by the news of it by no means tended\r\nto salve the wound which it inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe shop committee was so convulsed by the intelligence which Fisher\r\nminor brought, that they then and there promised themselves the pleasure\r\nof conveying the good news to Rollitt\'s accusers in person.  They\r\naccordingly adjourned in a body to the Modern side.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t Clapperton grin!" said Percy.  "I say, you chaps, we may as well\r\nlet him have it one at a time.  Then he\'ll hear it nine times over, do\r\nyou see?  I\'ll go first."\r\n\r\nThe idea seemed a good one, but risky.  Cottle calculated that after\r\nabout the fourth time Clapperton would be a little riled.  He therefore\r\nmodestly proposed to follow Percy.  Cash and Lickford competed smartly\r\nfor the third place, the former being successful.  Ramshaw, having to\r\ncome fifth, had decided misgivings as to the fun of the thing; while the\r\nClassic juniors declined to play unless all the others remained on the\r\nspot ready to back up in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nIt was also decided that, for precautionary reasons, the key of\r\nClapperton\'s door should be removed for the time being, lest he should\r\ntry to lock the good news out; and that an interval of two minutes\r\nshould be allowed to elapse between each messenger\'s announcement.\r\n\r\nLittle dreaming of the exquisite torture being prepared for him,\r\nClapperton sat in his study engaged in the farce of preparation.\r\n\r\nHe had plenty to think of besides lessons.  Things had all gone wrong\r\nwith him.  Dangle and he had fought.  Brinkman, after his thrashing by\r\nCorder, no longer counted.  Fullerton had rebelled, and was taking boys\r\nover every day to the enemy.  Corder had successfully defied his--\r\nClapperton\'s--authority, and the juniors snapped their fingers at him.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Clapperton had come up this term determined to lay himself out\r\nfor his side, and be the most popular prefect in Fellsgarth!\r\n\r\nHis one comfort was that the Classics were under a cloud too.  One of\r\ntheir number was a runaway thief; and a stigma rested on their side\r\nworse than any that attached to the Moderns.\r\n\r\nHe was trying to make the most of this questionable consolation when the\r\ndoor opened, and Percy bounced in.\r\n\r\n"I say, Clapperton; Fisher\'s found the money.  Rollitt\'s not a thief.\r\nAin\'t you glad?  Hurray!"\r\n\r\nAnd, without waiting, he retired as suddenly as he had come.\r\n\r\nClapperton gaped at the door by which he had gone in amazement.  He had\r\nnever calculated on this.  This was the worst thing yet.  It showed\r\nYorke had been right, and that he and Dangle--\r\n\r\nThe door opened again, and Cottle ran in.  "Hurray, Clapperton!  The\r\nmoney\'s found.  Rollitt\'s no thief.  Ain\'t you glad?"  And he, too,\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThere must be something in it.  What a fool he would look to all\r\nFellsgarth!  Perhaps it was only a plot, though, to shield Rollitt.\r\nPerhaps--\r\n\r\nThe door once more swung open, and in jumped Cash.\r\n\r\n"Clapperton, I say--Hooray!  That money\'s been found.  Rollitt\'s no\r\nthief.  Ain\'t you glad?"\r\n\r\nHullo!  At this rate he would get to know the news.  How they would crow\r\non the other side!  He wondered if Fisher major had done it on purp--\r\n\r\nAgain there was a scuffle of feet at the door, and Lickford stepped in.\r\n\r\n"Oh!  Clapperton," he said.  "Hooray, Clapperton!  The money\'s turned\r\nup, and Rollitt\'s no thief.  Ain\'t you glad?--and, oh, I say,\r\nClapperton--hooray!"\r\n\r\n"Come here," said Clapperton, sternly.\r\n\r\nBut, oh dear no; Lickford was pressed, and couldn\'t stay.\r\n\r\n"The young asses!" growled Clapperton.  "Why can\'t they keep their\r\nprecious news to themselves?  If they\'d tried, they couldn\'t have made\r\nbigger nuisances of themselves.  I suppose, now, Yorke will--"\r\n\r\nThe door swung open again, and Ramshaw, hanging on to the handle, swung\r\nin with it.\r\n\r\n"Hooray, Clapperton!  Rollitt\'s no thief.  That money\'s turned up.\r\nAin\'t you glad?  I am--good evening."\r\n\r\nThis final greeting was cut short by a ruler which Clapperton sent\r\nflying at the messenger\'s head.  Ramshaw dodged in time, and the ruler\r\nflew out into the passage, where it was promptly captured by Fisher\r\nminor, whose turn came next.\r\n\r\n"Thank goodness that\'s the end of the young cads!" growled Clapperton.\r\n"They\'ve done it on purpose; and I\'ll pay them out for it.  That ass,\r\nFisher major, he\'s bound to--"\r\n\r\nHere there came a modest tap at the door, and Fisher minor peeped in,\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you want?  You\'ve no business on this side; go to your\r\nown house."\r\n\r\n"All right, Clapperton," said Fisher, speaking with unwonted rapidity.\r\n"I only thought you\'d like to know my brother\'s found the money.\r\nHurray!  Rollitt\'s no thief; ain\'t you glad?--Yeow!"\r\n\r\nThis last exclamation was in response to a grab from the enraged\r\nClapperton, which, though it failed to catch the messenger, clawed his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had enough of this," said the senior.  "I don\'t care--.  Hullo!\r\nwhere\'s my key?"\r\n\r\nThe key was not to be seen.  He looked out into the passage; it was not\r\nthere.  No one else was in sight.\r\n\r\nHe returned viciously to his seat at the table, and began to read again.\r\n\r\nThe door had opened, and Ashby, on tip-toe, was in the room before the\r\nsenior noticed the fresh intrusion.\r\n\r\n"Rollitt\'s no thief; ain\'t you glad?  The money\'s found.  Hurray,\r\nClapperton!--done it!" exclaimed Ashby, all in one breath, dancing out\r\nof the room in conscious pride at his exploit.\r\n\r\n"All very well," said D\'Arcy, whose turn came next; "how am I to do it?"\r\n\r\n"No shirking," said Wally; "I come after you."\r\n\r\n"Look here," said D\'Arcy; "if you chaps give me a leg-up, I\'ll let him\r\nhave it through his window.  I can reach round from this passage window\r\nto his if you hang on to my legs."\r\n\r\n"Good dodge," said Wally, admiringly, "but we\'d better turn the key on\r\nthe door first.  If he came out and spotted us holding you, we might\r\nhave to drop you."\r\n\r\nSo the key was quietly put in the lock and turned; and D\'Arcy, firmly\r\nheld by the heels, wriggled himself out of the window, and, with the aid\r\nof a pipe, pulled himself up, with his face to the window of\r\nClapperton\'s study.\r\n\r\nThat worthy was beginning to congratulate himself that he would be\r\nspared a further repetition of the uncomfortable news that night, when a\r\nsudden, loud voice at one of the open lattice panes almost startled him\r\nout of his skin.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Clapperton!  Ain\'t you glad?  Rollitt\'s no thief.  The money\'s\r\nfound.  Good evening--have you used our soap?  Haul in, you chaps!\r\nSharp!"\r\n\r\nThe persecuted senior, after the first surprise, made a frantic rush,\r\nfirst at the window, and then, finding the bird flown, at the door.  The\r\nlatter was locked.  He could hear a scuffling and scrambling in the\r\nlobby outside, followed by a stampede; after which dead silence\r\nprevailed, save for the vicious kicking of the imprisoned hero at his\r\nown door.\r\n\r\n"Whew!" said Wally, fanning himself when the juniors were safe back in\r\nPercy\'s study.  "That was a squeak, if you like.  How on earth am I to\r\ndo it?"\r\n\r\n"Better let him off," suggested some one.\r\n\r\nWally resented the suggestion as an insult.\r\n\r\n"Not likely," said he.  "I\'ll do it.  I don\'t care, if you all back up."\r\n\r\nAnd in a minute, when the sound of the kicking had ceased, and\r\nClapperton had apparently retired once more to his work, he crept out\r\ninto the lobby, followed stealthily by the whole band.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the head of the stairs, whose voice should they hear\r\nbelow, inquiring of a middle-boy if Clapperton was in the house, but the\r\ndoctor\'s?\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; shall I tell him you want him?" said the boy.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ll go up to his room," said the head-master.\r\n\r\n"Whew!" said Wally, "what a go! and the door\'s locked on the outside!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and turn it quietly," said Percy, "if you back up in case he\r\nflies out."\r\n\r\nBut the precaution was not needed.  Percy, who luckily had just taken\r\noff his boots, slipped up silently to the door, and the others from\r\ntheir lurking-place saw him quietly turn the key and then walk back,\r\nevidently unheard by the prisoner within.\r\n\r\nHe passed the stair-head just before the doctor came up, and to their\r\ngreat relief ran into the arms of his friends unchallenged.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, indeed, was too pre-occupied to dream that, as he went to\r\nClapperton\'s study, nine small heads were craning out of a door at the\r\nend of the passage, watching his every step.\r\n\r\n"I say," whispered Ashby, in tones of horror, "suppose Clap thinks it\'s\r\none of us, and goes for him!"\r\n\r\n"My eye, what a go!" ejaculated Cash.\r\n\r\nThey saw the stately figure stand a moment at the door and turn the\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\nNext moment he reeled back with an exclamation of amazement, nearly\r\nfelled to the ground by a bulky dictionary hurled at his head!\r\n\r\nThe nine lurkers fairly embraced one another in horror at the sight of\r\nthis awful outrage; and when, a moment after, they saw the doctor gather\r\nhimself together and return to the charge, this time closing the door\r\nbehind him, they did not envy the unlucky Clapperton the awkward five\r\nminutes in store for him.\r\n\r\nHow the two arranged matters no one could say.  But as no sounds of\r\nviolence issued, and the doctor did not summon any one to fetch his\r\ncane, they concluded Clapperton had offered a sufficiently humble\r\napology for his mistake.\r\n\r\n"Hold on, now," said Wally, after three minutes had passed; "I\'ll try it\r\nnow--it\'s my only chance.  You Classic kids be ready to cut home with me\r\nas soon as I come back."\r\n\r\nSo, starting at a run like one who had come a long distance and expected\r\nto find the senior alone, he dashed unceremoniously into Clapperton\'s\r\nstudy, of course not appearing to notice the distinguished company\r\npresent, crying--\r\n\r\n"I say, Clapperton.  Hooray!  The money\'s found.  Rollitt\'s no thief.\r\nAin\'t you glad!  Oh, the doctor!  I beg your pardon, sir."\r\n\r\nThe next moment he, D\'Arcy, Ashby, and Fisher minor were descending the\r\nstairs three steps at a time on the way back to Mr Wakefield\'s as fast\r\nas their legs would carry them, and with all the righteous satisfaction\r\nof men who had done their duty at all costs.\r\n\r\n"I reckon," said Wally, "he pretty well knows about it now--and if he\r\ndon\'t, the doctor will rub it in."\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Clapperton, indeed, required no one to "rub in" the fact\r\nthat he had made a mess of things.\r\n\r\nThe doctor did not attempt to do it.  He merely carried the news of the\r\nfinding of the money, and desired Clapperton, as the head of the house,\r\nto make it known as widely as possible.\r\n\r\n"I say nothing now of the cruel wrong which has been inflicted by hasty\r\nsuspicion on Rollitt.  That shadow is still on the School.  But the\r\nworst shadow, that a Fellsgarth boy was a thief, is happily removed, and\r\nI wish every boy in this house to hear of it at the earliest possible\r\nmoment."\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor went, leaving Clapperton to gulp down the bitter pill as\r\nbest he could.\r\n\r\nWhy should he have the job to do?  He had not been the first to start\r\nthe suspicions.  Dangle had done that--Dangle, with whom he had fought.\r\nWhy should not Dangle be called upon to put it right?  Unluckily, Dangle\r\nwas not the captain of Forder\'s.  He was not as responsible in starting\r\nthe rumour as Clapperton, in his position, had been in adopting it.\r\n\r\nIt was more than he could bring himself to, to summon the house and\r\nannounce the news publicly.  If Dangle and Brinkman had been with him\r\nstill, the three of them together might have brazened it out.  But his\r\ncolleagues were sulking in their own quarters, and whatever had to be\r\ndone must be done singlehanded.\r\n\r\nHe therefore sat down in no very happy frame of mind and wrote out the\r\nfollowing curt notice for the house-boards.--\r\n\r\n"Notice.\r\n\r\n"The head-master wishes it to be known that the Club money supposed to\r\nbe missing has been found by the treasurer.\r\n\r\n"Geo.  Clapperton."\r\n\r\nThis ungracious document he copied out three times, and taking advantage\r\nof every one being in his study for preparation, affixed with his own\r\nhand on the notice boards at the house-door and on each landing.\r\n\r\n"There!" said he, with a sneer of disgust, as he returned to his own\r\nroom, "let them make the most of that."\r\n\r\nAn hour later the dormitory bell sounded, and he could hear the\r\nscuffling of feet on the lobby outside, and the clamour of voices as\r\nboys hustled one another in front of the boards.  Evidently the majority\r\nregarded the announcement in a jocular manner; and when a distant shout\r\nof laughter came up from the passage below, and down from the landing\r\nabove, it was clear that Forders did not take the matter very much to\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"It was ridiculous, when you come to think of it," soliloquised\r\nClapperton, "that a blundering ass like Fisher major should have brought\r\nthe School into such a precious mess."\r\n\r\nThe noise gradually died away as fellows one by one dropped of to bed.\r\n\r\nClapperton waited till they were gone before he followed.  As he passed\r\nthe notice board he glanced at the document which had lately cost him so\r\nmuch pain.  It was still there; but not as he left it.  A sentence had\r\nbeen squeezed in between his own words and his signature at the bottom\r\nof the sheet, which, as it was a fair imitation of his back-sloped\r\nhandwriting, had all the appearance of forming part of his manifesto.\r\nClapperton gasped with fury as he read the amended notice:--\r\n\r\n"Notice.\r\n\r\n"The head-master wishes it to be known that, the Club money supposed to\r\nbe missing has been found by the treasurer, and that I am a beast and a\r\nsneak to have accused Rollitt of stealing it.\r\n\r\n"Geo.  Clapperton."\r\n\r\nHe tore the paper from the board, and stamped on it in his rage.  Then\r\nhe went downstairs to look at the notice on the school-door.  It read\r\nprecisely like the other, the imitation being perhaps better.  He stayed\r\nonly to tear this down, and proceeded to the other landing, where the\r\nsame insult confronted him.\r\n\r\nWho the author might be he was free to guess.\r\n\r\nAs he lay awake that night, tossing and turning, he racked his brain to\r\ndevise some retribution.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, his more sensible self told him, hadn\'t he been leading up to\r\nthis all the term?  What had he done to make the fellows respect, much\r\nmore like, him?  He had bullied, and swaggered, and set himself against\r\nthe good of the School.  The fellows who followed him only did so in the\r\nhope of getting something--either fun or advantage--out of the\r\nagitation.  They didn\'t care twopence about Clapperton, and were ready\r\nenough to drop him as soon as ever it suited their turn.  The one or two\r\nthings he could do well, and for which anybody respected him--as, for\r\ninstance, football--he had deliberately shut himself off from, leaving\r\nhis authority to depend only on the very qualities he had least cause to\r\nbe proud of.\r\n\r\nIt was easy enough to say that Brinkman and Dangle cut even a poorer\r\nfigure over this wretched business than he.  But who troubled their\r\nheads about Brinkman and Dangle?  The former had already been snuffed\r\nout hopelessly, and dared not show his face.  Dangle, as everybody knew,\r\nhad a personal grudge against Rollitt, and was unhampered by scruples as\r\nto how he scored.  But he--Clapperton--he had always tried to pose as a\r\ndecent sort of fellow, with some kind of interest in the good of the\r\nSchool and some sort of notion about common honour and decency.  Ugh!\r\nthis was what had come of it!  As he lay awake that night, the sound of\r\nthe laughter round the notice boards and the "Ain\'t you glad?" of the\r\njuniors dinned in his ears, sometimes infuriating, sometimes humiliating\r\nhim; but in either case mockingly reminding him that Clapperton\'s\r\ngreatest enemy in Fellsgarth was the captain of the Modern side.\r\n\r\nNext morning brought no news of the missing boy, and a vague feeling of\r\nanxiety spread through the School.  Boys remembered how proud and\r\nsensitive Rollitt had been, and how dreadful was the accusation against\r\nhim.  Suppose he had done something desperate?  He had cared little\r\nenough for danger when all went well.  Would he be likely to care more,\r\nnow that the School was in league against him, pointing to him as a\r\nthief, and hounding him out of its society?\r\n\r\nAll sorts of dreadful possibilities occurred both to masters and boys;\r\nand all the while a feeling of fierce resentment was growing against the\r\nfellows whose accusations had been the cause of all the mischief.\r\n\r\nDangle, as he crossed the Green to class, was hooted all the way.\r\nBrinkman was followed about with derisive cheers, and cries of "Look\r\nout!  Corder\'s coming"; and Clapperton, when he appeared, was silently\r\ncut.  Fellows went out of the way to avoid him; and the chair on either\r\nside of him was left vacant in Hall.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear," said Ramshaw to his neighbour at the prefects\' table at\r\ndinner-time, "that they\'ve begun to drag the lake to-day?"\r\n\r\nA grim silence greeted the question.  Fellows tried to go on with their\r\nmeal.  But somehow Ramshaw had destroyed every one\'s appetite.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said Yorke.  "He took food with him.  You forget that."\r\n\r\n"That looks as if he\'d gone off the beaten track somewhere," said\r\nFullerton.\r\n\r\n"It does--and Hawk\'s Pike is as likely a place as any other," said\r\nYorke.\r\n\r\n"Whew! there was frost on it the other night," some one said.  "I wish\r\nthe doctor would let us go out and look for him.  We\'ve a much better\r\nchance of finding him than police and guides."\r\n\r\nHere the signal was given to rise, and every one dispersed.  Yorke\r\nstayed--one of the last.  As he went out he caught sight of a solitary\r\nfigure walking moodily ahead, with hands dug in pockets and head down,\r\nthe picture of dejection.\r\n\r\nYorke could hardly recognise in this back view his old rival and enemy,\r\nClapperton.  Yet he it was.  A few weeks ago, and he always marched to\r\nand from his house in the boisterous company of friends and admirers.\r\nNow he was left alone.\r\n\r\nA flush of something like shame mounted to the captain\'s cheeks.  He had\r\nno love for this fellow.  He owed him little gratitude.  And yet the\r\nsight of him thus solitary, cut off from the stream, stirred him.\r\n\r\nDid he not try, in his humble way, to follow in the footsteps of One Who\r\nsaid, "Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you"?  And was not\r\nthis an opportunity for putting that faith of his to the test of\r\npractice?\r\n\r\nHe quickened his pace, and overtook Clapperton.  The Modern senior\r\nwheeled round half-savagely.\r\n\r\n"Clapperton," said the captain, "we\'ve been enemies all this term.  I\'ve\r\nthought harshly of you, and you\'ve thought harshly of me.  Why shouldn\'t\r\nwe be friends?"\r\n\r\n"What!" almost growled Clapperton; "are you making a fool of me?"\r\n\r\n"No--but we\'ve tried hating one another long enough.  Let\'s try being\r\nfriends for a change."\r\n\r\nThey stood facing one another; the one serene, honest, inviting; the\r\nother dejected and doubting.  But as their eyes met the fires kindled\r\nagain in Clapperton\'s face, and the cloud swept off his brow.  He pulled\r\nhis hand from his pocket and held it out.\r\n\r\n"Done with you, Yorke.  You\'re the last fellow in Fellsgarth I expected\r\nto call friend just now."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE OF THE COCK-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nYorke was roused before daybreak next morning by a voice at his bedside.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Yorke?"\r\n\r\nThe voice was Mr Stratton\'s.  The captain bounded to his feet at once.\r\n\r\n"What is it, sir?  Has he been found?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the master; "no news.  Every place has been searched where he\r\nwould be likely to be, except the mountain.  It seems a very off-chance\r\nthat he has gone up there; still, it is possible.  He has been on it\r\nonce or twice before.  I am going there now.  Would you care to come\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\nThe captain gratefully acquiesced.  For a week he had been chafing at\r\nthe doctor\'s orders that no boy should go beyond the bounds.  His\r\nrequest to be allowed to undertake this very expedition had been twice\r\nrefused already.\r\n\r\n"The doctor has given you an _exeat_ if you wish to go," said Mr\r\nStratton.  "We are to take a guide, and it is quite understood we may be\r\nlate in getting back.  I shall be glad of your company."\r\n\r\nYorke was ready in ten minutes--thankful at last to be allowed to do\r\nsomething, yet secretly doubting if anything would come of this forlorn\r\nquest.\r\n\r\nApart from Rollitt, however, good did come of it to Fellsgarth.  For\r\nduring the long walk master and boy got to understand one another better\r\nthan ever before.  With a common ambition for the welfare of the School,\r\nand a common trouble at the dissensions which had split it up during the\r\npresent term, they also discovered a common hope for better times ahead.\r\n\r\nThey discussed all sorts of plans, and exchanged confidences about all\r\nsorts of difficulties.  And all the while they felt drawn close to one\r\nanother, exchanging the ordinary relations of master and boy for those\r\nof friend and friend.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may say that Mr Stratton must have been a very\r\nfoolish master to give himself away to a boy, or that Yorke must have\r\nbeen a very presuming boy to talk so familiarly to a master.  Who cares\r\nwhat they were, if they and Fellsgarth were the better for that\r\nmorning\'s walk?\r\n\r\n"In many ways," said Mr Stratton, "a head boy has as much\r\nresponsibility for the good of a school as a head-master--always more\r\nthan an assistant master.  You could wreck the School in a week if you\r\nchose; and it is in your hands to pull it together more than any of us\r\nmasters, however much we should like to do it.  And you\'ll do it, old\r\nfellow!"\r\n\r\nAnd so they turned up the lane that led round to the back of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nThe news that Mr Stratton and the captain had gone up Hawk\'s Pike to\r\nlook for Rollitt soon spread through Fellsgarth that morning.  The souls\r\nof our friends the juniors were seriously stirred by it.\r\n\r\nTheir promise--or shall we say threat?--to organise a search-party up\r\nthe mountain on their own account had been lost sight of somewhat in the\r\nexciting distractions of the last twenty-four hours; but now that they\r\nfound the ground cut from under their feet they were very indignant.\r\nSecretly, no doubt, they were a little relieved to find that they had\r\nbeen forestalled in the perilous venture of a winter ascent of the\r\nformidable pike they had such good cause to remember.\r\n\r\nIt was a mean trick of Yorke\'s to "chowse" them out of the credit, they\r\nprotested.  Now he would get all the glory, and they would get none.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Percy.  "It\'s my notion Rollitt\'s not gone up\r\nthe mountain at all.  It\'s just a dodge of those two to get a jolly good\r\nspree for themselves.  Pooh!  They\'ll get lost.  We shall have to go and\r\nlook for them, most likely."\r\n\r\n"And then," said Lickford, "somebody will have to come and look for us."\r\n\r\n"And Rollitt\'s not here to do it," said Fisher minor.\r\n\r\nThis cast the company back on to their original subject.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my notion," said Wally, "he\'s got on the island in the middle of\r\nthe lake, like Robinson Crusoe."\r\n\r\n"Rather a lark," said Ashby, "to get up a search-party and go and look\r\nfor him there."\r\n\r\nThe idea took wonderfully.  To-day was "Founder\'s Day," a whole holiday.\r\nThey would certainly go and look for Rollitt on the island.\r\n\r\nThe preparations disclosed an odd conception on the part of the\r\nexplorers of the serious nature of their quest.  Their stated object was\r\nto rescue a lost schoolfellow.  Why, therefore, did they decide to take\r\nnine pennyworth of brandy-balls, a football, a pair of boxing-gloves,\r\nand other articles of luxury not usually held to be necessary to the\r\nequipment of a relief expedition?\r\n\r\nAs regards food, they possessed too keen a recollection of the straits\r\nthey had been put to up the mountain a few weeks ago to neglect that\r\nimportant consideration now.\r\n\r\nNaturally, ham and Abernethys were the victuals selected.  Had not\r\nRollitt made these classical as the staff of life during voluntary exile\r\nfrom school?\r\n\r\nThey were compelled to put up with a very small sample of the former.\r\nLickford had been bequeathed a bone by his senior yesterday, to which\r\nadhered a few fragments of a once small ham.  Possibly it might, with\r\ncareful carving, furnish nine small slices.\r\n\r\nIt was better than nothing.  They would make up for its deficiency by a\r\ndouble lot of Abernethys.\r\n\r\nSo they trooped off to the shop.\r\n\r\nAccording to their own rules, this establishment was only open between\r\n11 and 12 in the morning, and not at all on holidays.\r\n\r\nBut another rule said that the committee might in certain cases suspend\r\nor alter the rules.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Percy moved, and Ashby seconded, the following resolution:\r\n"That this shop be, and is, hereby opened for the space of five\r\nminutes."  The motion was carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nD\'Arcy and Cottle, whose turn it was to be on duty, solemnly took down\r\nthe shutters, and ranged themselves behind the counter.\r\n\r\n"What can I do for you, my little dears?" said the former,\r\nencouragingly.  "Money down.  No tick.  Try some of our Rollitt\'s\r\nparticular--three-halfpence each."\r\n\r\n"No, they\'re not, you cheat!--they\'re a penny.  We\'d better have two\r\neach," said Wally.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!  I say," exclaimed D\'Arcy.  "Look here, you fellows."\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the heap of Abernethy biscuits, on the top of which lay a\r\nsixpence.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you call looking after the money," said Wally.  "Left that\r\nthere all night."\r\n\r\n"No--not a bit of it.  But I tell you what," said D\'Arcy, who had\r\nrapidly been counting the pile of biscuits; "there were twenty-four\r\nbiscuits there when we left last night.  I\'m certain of it; weren\'t\r\nthere, young Cottle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I remember that," testified Cottle.\r\n\r\n"Very well; then some one\'s been here in the night, for there are only\r\neighteen biscuits now, and this sixpence."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Yorke got some before he started?"\r\n\r\n"How could he?  No one can get in here without the latch-key; and only\r\nthe two chaps who are on duty keep that."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s the owls in the belfry?"\r\n\r\n"They don\'t generally pay ready money for what they take."\r\n\r\n"I say!" exclaimed Wally; "I expect it\'s Rollitt.  He\'d have finished\r\nhis others by this time, and he sneaked back in the night for some more.\r\nGood old Rollitt!"\r\n\r\nWally did not stay to explain how Rollitt could have got in any more\r\nthan any one else.  His suggestion made a deep impression.  It touched\r\nthem to feel that, amid all his distresses, Rollitt was loyal to the\r\nSchool shop; and if anything was needed to spur them on to his rescue,\r\nthis did it.\r\n\r\nThey bought up the remaining eighteen biscuits between them, and sallied\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Wally, "it\'s much more likely to be the island than the\r\nmountain.  There\'s water there, for one thing."\r\n\r\n"There\'s water on the mountain," said Ashby; "plenty."\r\n\r\n"But not good to drink, you ass!" argued Wally.\r\n\r\n"And there\'s that old broken boat-house to live in, and lots of wood to\r\nmake fires, and ducks to bag and fish to catch.  I say!  I expect he\'s\r\nhaving rather a lark."\r\n\r\nThe prospect of sharing in his wild sports urged them on still faster.\r\n\r\nAt the lake-side a new problem arose.  If Rollitt was on the island, how\r\nhad he got there?  And, still more important, how were they to get\r\nthere?  Widow Wisdom\'s boat had already been laid up for the winter; and\r\nthe few others, which in the summer were generally kept at the river-\r\nmouth for the use of the boys, had been taken back to Penchurch.  The\r\nonly craft available was a flat-bottomed punt used by fishermen, and at\r\npresent moored to a stake at the river-bank.  It was capacious,\r\ncertainly, but not exactly the sort of boat in which to get up much\r\npace, particularly as its sole apparent mode of propulsion was by means\r\nof two very long boat-hooks, one on either side.  These details,\r\nhowever, presented few obstacles to the minds of the enterprising\r\nexplorers.  The punt was in many ways adapted for a voyage such as they\r\nproposed to take.  There was room to walk about in it.  Nay, who should\r\nsay the boxing-gloves and football might not have scope for themselves\r\nwithin its ample lines?\r\n\r\nThe one question was whether the boat-hooks were long enough to touch\r\nbottom all the way from the shore to the island.  Wally paced one, and\r\nfound it measured eighteen feet.\r\n\r\n"Ought to do," said he; "it\'s bound not to be deeper than that."\r\n\r\nSo the punt, which was christened the "Cock-house" for the occasion, was\r\nloosed from her moorings, the Abernethys and knuckle-bone and other\r\nstores were put on board, the boat-hooks, by a combined effort, were got\r\ninto position, and the party embarked for the rescue of Rollitt.\r\n\r\nThanks to the stream, their progress at first was satisfactory.  They\r\nwere delighted to find how easily they went.  Wally with one boat-book\r\non one side, and Percy with the other on the other side, had\r\ncomparatively little to do except to prevent their hooks getting stuck\r\nin the mud at the bottom, and refusing to come out.  Any one watching\r\nthem would have said these boys had been born in a barge.  They carried\r\ntheir long poles to the prow, and plunged them in there with a mighty\r\nsplash.  Then they shoved away, till the end of the poles came within\r\nreach of their hands.  Then, in perfect step and time, they started to\r\nmarch, each down his own side of the boat, calling on their friends and\r\nadmirers to get out of the way.  Then, as they neared the stern, and the\r\nprospect of pulling up their hooks and returning fora\'d for another\r\n"punt" loomed ahead, their faces grew anxious and concerned.  They began\r\nto hold on "hard all," a yard from the end of the walk, and tug\r\nfrantically to get themselves free.  Sometimes the hook came out easily,\r\nin which case they fell backwards into the arms of their friends.  At\r\nother times it stuck, and they had to detain the progress of the boat a\r\nminute or more to get it out.  And sometimes it all but escaped them,\r\nand continued sticking up out of the water while the barge itself\r\nfloated on.  Happily, the last tragedy never quite came off, although it\r\nwas periodically imminent.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the stream opened into the lake, the progress became much\r\nless exciting.  The water was a little lumpy, and had a tendency, while\r\nthey were walking back at the end of one punt in order to start another,\r\nof jumping the "Cock-House" back into precisely the same position from\r\nwhich she had lately started.\r\n\r\nAfter about half an hour\'s fruitless efforts the twins were seized with\r\na generous desire not to monopolise the whole of the fun of the voyage.\r\n\r\n"Like to have a go!" said Wally to D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"You may have a turn if you like, Lick," said Percy.\r\n\r\nWhereupon D\'Arcy and Lickford took up the rowing for the "Cock-House,"\r\ngreatly assisted and enlivened in their operations by the advice and\r\nencouragement of the late navigators.\r\n\r\n"Two to one on Lick," cried Wally, as the two started their mad career\r\ndown the boat.  "Look out! he\'s gaining."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve made her go an inch and a half," said Percy.\r\n\r\n"Hang on tight now, and pull it up," said Wally, as Lickford, red in the\r\nface with excitement, was straining himself to release the hook from the\r\nmud.\r\n\r\n"Keep her trim," said Percy, laying hold of D\'Arcy\'s feet, as the latter\r\nwas gradually letting himself be hauled out of the boat by his\r\nrefractory pole.\r\n\r\nIn due time D\'Arcy and Lickford unselfishly gave up the poles to Cottle\r\nand Ashby; and they, after a reasonable season of struggle and peril,\r\nnobly ceded them to Ramshaw and Cash, Fisher minor waiving his claim,\r\nand electing to sit "odd man out" and steer.\r\n\r\nAs at the end of an hour and a half\'s manful shoving the net progress\r\nmade was a yard back into the stream of the river, the talents of the\r\nhelmsman were not put to a very severe test.\r\n\r\n"I say, it\'s rather slow," said Wally; "let\'s have some of Rollitt\'s\r\nparticular."\r\n\r\nSo while Percy with a small pair of scissors--none of the party,\r\nmarvellous to relate, had brought a knife--was carving the remnant of\r\nham, and Ashby was counting out nine brandy-balls from the bag, each\r\nmember of the party produced one of his Abernethys, and fell-to with all\r\nthe appetite that waits on hard and honest toil.\r\n\r\n"Not much of a pace yet," remarked D\'Arcy.  "Why, we\'re going better now\r\nwe\'ve stopped rowing than we were before."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because the wind\'s changed," said Wally.  "If we\'d only got a\r\nsail we could make her go."\r\n\r\n"Why not stick up the two poles, and fasten our coats or something\r\nbetween for a sail!" suggested Percy.\r\n\r\n"Good idea! the poles are long enough for all the nine.  One of \'em can\r\ngo through right sleeves, and the other through left.  It\'ll make a\r\nripping sail."\r\n\r\nSo, despite the season of the year, the nine voyagers divested\r\nthemselves of their coats, which were industriously threaded by the\r\nsleeves on either pole.  The top coat was spiked by the hooks, and those\r\nbelow were ingeniously buttoned one to the other to keep them up.\r\n\r\nEvery one agreed it made a ripping sail.  The difficulty was to hoist\r\nit.  There were no holes in which to fix the parallel masts.  They would\r\nhave to be held in position, as the breeze was stiffening, and it\r\nrequired all hands aloft.\r\n\r\nAt length, by superhuman exertions, the complex fabric was slowly\r\nhoisted to the perpendicular, looking very like a ladder, up which nine\r\nscarecrows were clambering.  However, no matter what it looked like now,\r\nas Wally predicted, they\'d spank along.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going already," gasped he, panting with the exertion of holding\r\nup his mast.  "Look out now! here\'s a nice breeze coming."\r\n\r\nHe was right.  Next moment the vast foresail fell with a run by the\r\nboard, and the nine athletes below were nearly shot into the air by the\r\nforce of the collapse.  The coats, fortunately, held together\r\nsufficiently well to enable them to be hauled on board in a piece; but\r\nas they were soaked through, they afforded very little comfort to the\r\ndistressed seamen, who decided forthwith to shorten sail at once, and\r\ntake to the poles once more.\r\n\r\nBut by this time the "Cock-House," thanks to the tremendous impetus it\r\nhad just received, was twenty yards from the shore; and Wally, when he\r\nput down his pole, nearly went after it, in the vain search for a\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a go!" said he; "I say, you chaps, I almost fancy, after all,\r\nRollitt must be up the mountain.  What do you say?"\r\n\r\n"I thought so all along," said Fisher minor.  "If he is, Yorke and\r\nStratton will find him."\r\n\r\n"Good old Yorke!  I say--we may as well back water a bit."\r\n\r\nEasier said than done.  The old punt, now she was once out on the vasty\r\ndeep, behaved pretty much as she and the wind between them pleased.  For\r\na time it looked very much as if, after all the explorers would reach\r\ntheir destination.\r\n\r\nBut presently--just, indeed, as the explorers had started a small\r\nfootball match (Association rules), Classics against Moderns, to keep\r\nthemselves warm, the fickle breeze shifted, and sent the "Cock-House"\r\nlumbering inshore a mile or so north of the river-mouth.  The Classics\r\nhad just scored their 114th goal as she grounded, and it was declared by\r\ncommon consent that the voyage was at an end.\r\n\r\nLuckily, she came ashore near to a little creek, into which, by\r\nprodigious haulings and shovings, she was turned; and here, in a rude\r\nway, they succeeded in mooring her until a more convenient season.\r\n\r\nThe call-over bell was just beginning to ring when the nine mariners got\r\nback to Fellsgarth.\r\n\r\nGreat cheering was going on on the Green, and boys were crowding\r\ntogether discussing some great news.\r\n\r\n"What is it?--Rollitt turned up?" asked the juniors.\r\n\r\n"No; haven\'t you heard?  Yorke and Stratton went up to look for him on\r\nHawk\'s Pike.  They didn\'t find him, but _they got to the top_!"\r\n\r\n"Got to the top!  One of our chaps got to the top of Hawk\'s Pike.\r\nHurroo.  Yell, you chaps.  Bravo, Yorke!  Bully for Fellsgarth!"\r\n\r\n"I wish they\'d found Rollitt, all the same," said Fisher minor; "I\'m\r\nafraid he\'s gone for good."\r\n\r\n"Not he.  Didn\'t we nearly find him to-day, you young muff?" retorted\r\nWally.  "Besides, a fellow who\'s gone for good wouldn\'t come and buy\r\nsixpenny-worth of Abernethys at our shop in the night, would he?"\r\n\r\nFisher minor took what comfort he could from the assurance, and trooped\r\nin with his fellow-adventurers to call-over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\n"BURY THE HATCHET!"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Yorke\'s exploit, and the prevailing hopefulness of the\r\njuniors, the feeling of gloom deepened on Fellsgarth when another day\r\nended, and no news was forthcoming of the lost boy.\r\n\r\nTo a great many it was a shock to hear he was not on the mountain.  From\r\nwhat was known of his eccentricities and recklessness, it seemed as\r\nlikely as not he would retreat up there and remain till he was fetched\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found he was not there, there seemed to be nowhere else left\r\nto look.  The lake (quite independently of the eventful cruise of the\r\n"Cock-house") had been thoroughly searched; Penchurch had been\r\nransacked; every cottage and home in the neighbourhood had been called\r\nat.  The river-banks, up and down stream, had been searched too, and\r\ndaily communication with Rollitt\'s home made it increasingly clear he\r\nhad not gone there.\r\n\r\nThe incident of the six Abernethys and the 6 pence was not seriously\r\nconsidered.  There was no evidence that Rollitt had effected the\r\nmysterious purchase, and the eccentricities of the young shopmen left it\r\nvery doubtful whether more than half of that story was not a sensational\r\nfiction of their own.\r\n\r\nMasters and boys alike went to bed full of trouble and foreboding.\r\n\r\nFisher major, more perhaps than any one, took the situation to heart.\r\nHe had never ranged himself with Rollitt\'s accuser; yet, had it not been\r\nfor his bad management and stupidity, all the trouble would never have\r\ncome about.  Now, if anything grave had happened to the missing boy,\r\nFisher major felt that on his shoulders rested all the blame.\r\n\r\nBut his misery was turned into rage when, just before bedtime, a fag\r\ncame over with the following letter from Dangle:--\r\n\r\n"I am not surprised you should be so ready to be imposed upon.  You have\r\ndone mischief enough already; but you have been robbed all the same.\r\nAny one but a simpleton would see that the turning up of the money just\r\nwhen it did was a suspicious coincidence.  What could be easier than for\r\nthe thief either to impose on Widow Wisdom, and get her to bring back\r\nthe money with the story about the shirt; or else, during one of his\r\nfrequent visits there, as soon as he saw that he was found out, to slip\r\nit into the pocket himself!  Where he got it from I don\'t pretend to\r\nguess; but I don\'t mind betting that somebody in the School is poorer by\r\nL4 10 shillings for this tardy act of restitution.  It deceived no one\r\nbut you.  `None are so blind,\' etcetera.\r\n\r\n"R.  Dangle."\r\n\r\nFisher fairly tore his hair over this scoundrelly document.  His impulse\r\nwas to go over then and there, drag the writer out of his bed, and make\r\nhim literally swallow his own words.  He might have done it, had not the\r\ncaptain just then looked in.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s up?" said the latter, who seemed none the worse for his big\r\nclimb.  "What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Matter?  Read this!" shouted Fisher.\r\n\r\nYorke read the letter.  An angry flush spread over his face as he did\r\nso.\r\n\r\n"He shall answer for it to-night!" said Fisher.  "No, not to-night.  Let\r\nthe cad have a night\'s rest.  He shall answer for it to-morrow, though,\r\nbefore the whole School.  Let me have the letter, old man."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll promise to make him smart for it."\r\n\r\n"You can make your mind easy about that."  Next morning, to the surprise\r\nof every one, a notice appeared on the door of each house.\r\n\r\nNotice.\r\n\r\n"A School meeting is summoned for this afternoon at 3.\r\n\r\n  "(Signed) C.  Yorke (Wakefield\'s).\r\n  G.  Clapperton (Forder\'s).\r\n  P.  Bingham (Stratton\'s).\r\n  L.  Porter (Wilbraham\'s)."\r\n\r\n"What\'s up now?" said Wally, as he read it.  "Like Clapperton\'s cheek to\r\ngo sticking his name under our man\'s--and old Bingham, too!  What right\r\nhas he to stick his nose in it?--and, ha, ha, Porter! that\'s the green\r\nidiot in specs, who calls himself captain of Wilbraham\'s!  Well, I\r\nnever!"\r\n\r\n"Shall you go?" asked D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"Rather!  Wonder what they\'re up to, though?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Rollitt\'s found, and they\'re going to trot him out."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they\'re going to have an eight-handed mill, those four--you\r\nknow--like what we had."\r\n\r\n"I know, when you rammed me below the belt," said Cottle.\r\n\r\n"Crams.  You know I played on your third waistcoat button.  I was never\r\nbelow it once."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Yorke\'s going to give a lecture on the ascent of Hawk\'s Pike."\r\n\r\n"I know what it is.  They\'re going to give the chaps back their\r\nsubscriptions.  What a run there\'ll be on the shop directly after!"\r\n\r\nThis last rumour was industriously put about by the juniors, and was\r\nbelieved in a good many quarters.\r\n\r\nA new diversion, however, served to put aside speculation for a time.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, who\'s that lout?" asked D\'Arcy, as he and Wally, having shaken\r\noff the others for a season, were "taking a cool," arm in arm near the\r\nplaying-field gate.\r\n\r\nThe object of this remark was a stalwart, middle-aged, labouring man,\r\nwho carried an American cloth bag in his hand, and, to judge by the mud\r\non his garments, had travelled some distance.  He was trying to open the\r\ngate into the field, and on seeing our two juniors beckoned to them\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t get in there," said Wally.  "You\'ll have to go to the other\r\ngate at the Watch-Tower."\r\n\r\n"Is this here Fellsgarth School, young master?" said the man.\r\n\r\n"Rather," replied Wally.\r\n\r\n"Is the governor at home!"\r\n\r\n"Who--Ringwood?  I don\'t know; they\'ll tell you at the gate."\r\n\r\n"He\'s come to mend the door of your young brother\'s room, I expect,"\r\nsaid D\'Arcy.  "I hope he won\'t bung up the squirt-hole while he\'s about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No.  I say, carpenter," said Wally, as the man was about to turn off in\r\nthe direction of the other gate, "when you mend that door in Forder\'s,\r\nmake it strong, do you hear?  It gets kicked at rather by fellows.  And\r\ndon\'t bung--"\r\n\r\n"Carpenter?  I ain\'t no carpenter.  I want to see the governor."\r\n\r\nGruffly as the man spoke, he evidently regarded the two young gentlemen\r\nas persons of some distinction, and lingered a moment longer to ask\r\nanother question.\r\n\r\n"Beg your pardon, young gents," said he; "but you don\'t chance to know\r\nif Alf Rollitt has come back?"\r\n\r\nThey gazed at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Rollitt? no.  Do _you_ know where he is, I say?"\r\n\r\n"Not come back?" said the man, hoarsely.  "I made sure as he\'d be back\r\nafore now."\r\n\r\n"Do you know where he is?" repeated Wally.\r\n\r\n"Not me--he\'s bound to be somewheres.  But the missus, she wouldn\'t rest\r\ntill I come and see."\r\n\r\n"The missus!  I say, do you _know_ Rollitt?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they do say it\'s a wise father as don\'t know his own child."\r\n\r\n"What!  Are _you_ Rollitt\'s father?" asked they, glancing involuntarily\r\nat the shabby clothes and rough, weatherbeaten face.\r\n\r\n"Nothing to be ashamed of, are it?" said the stranger.  "\'Tain\'t my\r\nAlf\'s fault I ain\'t in gents\' togs."\r\n\r\nThis rebuke abashed our two juniors considerably.\r\n\r\n"Rather not," said Wally.  "Our lot\'s backing Rollitt up, you know.\r\nWe\'ve been out to look for him, haven\'t we, D\'Arcy?"\r\n\r\n"Of course we have; good old Rollitt," said D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"Thank you kindly, young gents," said Mr Rollitt, who seemed rather\r\ndazed.  "I ain\'t no scholar, nor no gent either.  But my boy Alf\'s a\r\ngood boy, and he don\'t mean no disrespect to the likes of you by running\r\naway.  He\'s bound to be somewheres."\r\n\r\n"I say," said Wally, "if you come round to the other gate, you can get\r\nin--we\'ll show you where Ringwood\'s house is."\r\n\r\n"Tell you what," said he to D\'Arcy, as the two boys went back by the\r\nfield to meet him, "he doesn\'t seem a bad sort of chap--it won\'t do to\r\nlet my young brother Percy and those Modern cads get hold of him.  I\r\nvote we nurse him on our side while he\'s here."\r\n\r\n"All serene," said D\'Arcy.  "Ask him to tea after the meeting."\r\n\r\n"I suppose we shall have to let those other chaps be in it too,"\r\nsuggested Wally dubiously, after a moment.\r\n\r\n"Better.  We\'ll all see him through together."\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of two juniors, looking very important, carefully\r\nconducting an anxious-faced labouring man across the School Green, was\r\nenough to rouse a little curiosity.  And when presently the bodyguard,\r\nafter sundry whispered communications, increased from two to nine, who\r\nmarched three in front, two behind, and two on either side of their\r\ncelebrity, speculation became active and warm.\r\n\r\nThe escort glared defiantly at any one who ventured to approach the\r\ngroup; but when it was observed that they made straight for the doctor\'s\r\nhouse, and one by one shook hands with the visitor on the doorstep,\r\nthere was very little doubt left as to who the stranger might be.\r\n\r\n"Mind you come to tea," said Wally, as they parted.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you make no mistake, I\'ll be there," said the guest.\r\n\r\nWork in school that morning dragged heavily.  The impending meeting was\r\nperplexing the minds of not a few.  The phenomenon of Yorke\'s and\r\nClapperton\'s names appended to the same document puzzled boys who still\r\nkept alive the animosity which had wrecked the School clubs earlier in\r\nhe term and brought the sports to a deadlock.  And the addition of the\r\nnames of the captains of the other two houses made it evident that the\r\nwhole School was concerned in the business.  This, coupled with the\r\nmystery of Rollitt\'s disappearance, and the now notorious internecine\r\nfeuds of the Modern seniors, gave promise of one of the biggest meetings\r\never held in Hall.\r\n\r\nAs to the juniors, they had a treble care on their mind.  First, the\r\nmeeting, and the expected refunding of the Club subscriptions; second,\r\nthe consequent run on the shop; and third, the "small and early"\r\nin Wally\'s study afterwards to meet A. Rollitt, Senior, Esq.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite all these cares, the morning\'s work was got through,\r\nthe dreaded impositions were avoided, and when the midday meal was ended\r\na general rush was made for the familiar benches in Hall.\r\n\r\nThe state of doubt every one was in operated adversely to the usual\r\ncheering.  Fellows didn\'t know whom they were expected to cheer.\r\nDangle, for instance, pale and sullen,--were the Moderns expected to\r\ncheer him?  The Classics hissed him, which was one reason why his own\r\nhouse should applaud.  But then, if they cheered Dangle, how should they\r\ndo about Clapperton, who had fought Dangle a week ago?  They got over\r\nthe difficulty by doing neither, but starting party cries which they\r\ncould safely cheer; and chaffing everybody all round.\r\n\r\nPunctually at three, Yorke rose and said they no doubt were curious to\r\nknow what the meeting was called for.  It was called for one or two\r\npurposes.  The first was to see if they could revive the School clubs.\r\n(Cheers.)  He wasn\'t going to say a word of ancient history.\r\n(Laughter.)  But as they stood now, they had a lot of fellows anxious to\r\nplay, they had the materials for as good a fifteen this winter, and as\r\ngood an eleven next spring (cheers), as any school in the country; and\r\nyet the playing-fields stood idle, and the name of Fellsgarth was\r\ndropping out of all the records.  They had had enough of that sort of\r\nthing.  Every one was sick of it.  Fellows had agreed with him when it\r\nwas proposed to disband the clubs; he hoped they would agree with him\r\nnow that the time had come for reviving them.  But there was to be a\r\ndifference.  The clubs were not to be open to everybody, as heretofore.\r\nThey didn\'t want everybody.  (Hear, hear, from Wally, D\'Arcy, Ashby, and\r\nFisher, as they pointed across to the Modern juniors.)  They only wanted\r\nfellows who would play and _could_ play; as to the former, that of\r\ncourse would be decided by the fellow himself, who would send in an\r\napplication to the committee.  As to the latter, that would be decided\r\nby the captain.  (Oh!)  Yes, by the captain.  What\'s the good of a\r\ncaptain if he\'s not to decide a matter like that?  And if the fellow is\r\nnot satisfied with the captain\'s decision, he may appeal to Mr\r\nStratton, the new president of the club.  (Cheers.)  There\'s nothing to\r\nprevent any one who plays his best joining--there\'s nothing to prevent\r\nthose youngsters at the end of the room, who are kicking up such a row,\r\njoining the clubs, as long as they work hard in the field.  (Cheers and\r\nlaughter.)  The fellows who won\'t be eligible are the louts, and those\r\nwho can play but won\'t.  (Loud cheers.)\r\n\r\nClapperton rose to second the motion.  He had lost a great deal of his\r\n"side" during the last few days, and though he looked in better tiff\r\nthan he had done lately, the present occasion was evidently an effort.\r\nHe said: "Yorke has made a generous speech.  He avoided ancient history,\r\nand therefore did not go into the reason why the clubs were dissolved\r\nand the School sports came to smash.  I could tell you--but what\'s the\r\nuse?  You all know.  Yorke said to me before the meeting, `Let bygones\r\nbe bygones, old man--we were all to blame--bury the hatchet--let\'s get\r\nright for the future.\'  Gentlemen, there was one fellow who was not to\r\nblame.  His name was _not_ Clapperton.  It was Yorke."  (Loud cheers.)\r\n"But I say with him, if you let me, `Bury the hatchet.\'" (Cheers.) "And\r\nto prove it, I beg to hand in my name to the committee for election.  I\r\nanswer for myself that I am willing to play; and if the captain decides\r\nthat I can play," (laughter), "why, I will play."  (Loud applause.)\r\n\r\nFullerton and Corder both sprang up to support the motion.  The former\r\nmade way for Corder, who merely wished to say how delighted he was.  He\r\nalso voted for the burying of the hatchet.  He had minded being stopped\r\nfootball more than anything else.  He gave in his name.  He would play,\r\nand he might tell them that the captain had already told him he could\r\nplay.  (Laughter, and cries of "Blow your own trumpet.") All right--it\r\nwas the only thing he had to be cocky about; and he meant to be cocky.\r\nHe supported the motion.  (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nFullerton handed in his name, and was very glad to think that he and his\r\nold friend Clapperton would have a chance of running up the field again\r\ntogether.  ("If you\'re elected!" from the end of the room, and\r\nlaughter.)  Oh, of course, if he was elected.  He hoped when the\r\ngentleman down there was captain, fifty years hence, he would deal as\r\nliberally with candidates as he was sure Yorke would deal now.\r\n(Laughter, at Wally\'s expense.)\r\n\r\nThe other prefects followed suit, and gave in their allegiance to the\r\nnew clubs.  Curiosity was alive to see what attitude Brinkman and Dangle\r\nwould adopt.  For a while it seemed as if they would take no part; but\r\nat length, when Yorke was about to put the motion, Brinkman rose and\r\nsaid, "I made up my mind when I came here I\'d have no more to do with\r\nthe clubs.  But Yorke\'s `Bury the hatchet\' gives a fellow a chance.  If\r\nyou mean that," (Yes, yes), "if this is a fresh start, here\'s my name!"\r\n(Loud cheers.) "You needn\'t cheer.  I didn\'t mean to give it--but now I\r\nhave, I--I--won\'t shirk it," and he sat down hurriedly.\r\n\r\nThen Dangle rose, with a sneer on his face.\r\n\r\n"This sort of thing is infectious.  I can\'t feel quite so sure as some\r\nof you about burying the hatchet; but, not to be peculiar, you may put\r\nme down--"\r\n\r\n"And I can tell you at once, and before all these fellows," said Yorke,\r\nrising hotly, and interrupting, "that we won\'t have you!  And that\r\nbrings me to the other business--and that\'s about Rollitt.  We can\'t\r\nbury the hatchet so easily, as far as he is concerned.  For he is still\r\nabsent, and no one knows what has become of him.  I\'m not going to say a\r\nword to make little of Fisher\'s major\'s mistake.  It was bad enough, in\r\nall conscience, for Rollitt.  But it was only a mistake.  But what do\r\nyou fellows say of the cad who deliberately gets up a story about him;\r\nand, even when he finds out there is not a shadow of truth in it,\r\nrepeats it in a worse form than before?  There are some here who believed\r\nthe first report and joined in the suspicions.  That was hardly to be\r\nwondered at.  But every one of them had the decency, as soon as the\r\nmoney was found, to admit that they had been wrong, and to regret their\r\nunfair suspicion of a Fellsgarth fellow.  All but one--this cad here!\r\nOnly last night, you fellows, he wrote the letter I hold in my hand.  I\r\nmean to read it to you, and I hope you won\'t forget it in a hurry."\r\n\r\n"You shan\'t read it; it wasn\'t to you!" said Dangle, making a rush at\r\nthe paper; "give it back!"\r\n\r\n"You shall have it back," said Yorke in a warmer temper than any one had\r\nseen him in before, "when I\'ve read it.  Stop, and listen to it.\r\nIt\'ll do you good."\r\n\r\n"Read away!" sneered Dangle, giving up the contest.  "It\'s the truth."\r\n\r\nYorke read, and as he proceeded, shame and anger rose to boiling-point\r\nin the audience, so that towards the end the reader\'s voice was almost\r\ndrowned in the hisses.\r\n\r\n"There," said the captain, crumpling up the paper in his hand and\r\nflinging it at the writer\'s feet, "there\'s your letter; and until you\r\napologise to the whole school you have insulted, you needn\'t expect\r\nwe\'ll bury the hatchet!"\r\n\r\nDangle scowled round and tried to swagger.\r\n\r\n"Is that all the business?" he sneered.\r\n\r\n"No!" shouted some voices.  "He ought to be kicked."\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit," cried Wally, excitedly, standing on a form, "there\'s\r\nRollitt\'s governor just come.  Some of our chaps have gone to fetch him.\r\nHe\'ll--"\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and, escorted by half a dozen of the juniors, Mr\r\nRollitt, looking more bewildered than ever, walked in.\r\n\r\nHe looked apologetically from one side to the other, saying, "Thank\'ee\r\nkindly," and "No offence, young gents," until he found himself at the\r\nend of the Hall among the prefects.\r\n\r\nThen Yorke got up again, still hot with temper, and a dead silence\r\nensued.  Dangle smiled at first.  But his face gradually blanched as he\r\nlooked round and found his retreat cut off, and guessed what was coming.\r\n\r\n"Mr Rollitt," said Yorke, "we are your son\'s schoolfellows.  A great\r\nwrong has been done him.  He has been suspected of being a thief, and\r\nhas run away.  We all now know that he\'s not a thief; and we are ashamed\r\nthat he has ever been suspected.  We hope he will come back, so that we\r\nmay tell him so.  But there is one fellow here who still says your son\r\nis a thief, although he knows as well as we do he isn\'t.  What shall we\r\ndo to him?"\r\n\r\nMr Rollitt looked up and down, casting a glance first at his young\r\nprotectors at the end of the Hall, then scanning the benches before him,\r\nthen running his eye along the row of prefects, and finally taking the\r\nmeasure of Yorke as he stood and waited for an answer.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the question seemed to come home.\r\n\r\n"My son Alf a thief?  There\'s one of \'em says that, is there?  My son\r\nAlf a thief?  Do to him!  Why, I\'ll tell you.  Just keep him till my son\r\nAlf comes back, and make him go and say it to his face.  That\'s what _I_\r\nshould do to him, young gents."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we will do," said Yorke.  "The meeting is over."\r\n\r\nAnd amid the excitement that ensued, the rush to put down names for the\r\nnew club, the cheers and hootings and hand-shakings of old enemies, Mr\r\nRollitt was carried off in triumph by his nine hosts to high tea in\r\nWally Wheatfield\'s room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE WATCH-TOWER.\r\n\r\nWally\'s study--he always liked to call it a "study," but his friends\r\npreferred to call it a den--could comfortably accommodate six.  The\r\njuniors had frequently to own that nine, the normal size of the party,\r\nwas a jam.  When, in addition to that, a big, brawny man was thrown in,\r\nit came to be a serious question as to how the four walls would sustain\r\nthe strain.\r\n\r\nWally, however, was determined to manage somehow.  He indignantly\r\nrejected Percy\'s offer to his more spacious apartment over the way.  No.\r\nHe had captured the lion--he and D\'Arcy--and they would entertain him\r\nin their own den.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it was not so bad.  It only meant letting the fire out and\r\nputting one chair in the fender, and shoving the other end of the table\r\n(which had been doubled in length by the addition of the table out of a\r\nneighbouring room, that was within four inches of the same height) close\r\nup against the door, which it was just possible to shut.  As, however,\r\nthe door opened outwards, it was necessary for the gentleman occupying\r\nthe foot of the table to sit out in the passage, much to the\r\ninconvenience of the casual passers-by.\r\n\r\nTo a shy man like Mr Rollitt, it was a difficult position to find\r\nhimself the honoured guest of nine young gentlemen like these.\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee kindly, young masters," said he, when Ashby relieved him of\r\nhis hat and Fisher minor of his bag, and Percy undermined him with a\r\nchair, and Cottle handed him the _Boy\'s Own Paper_, and Cash came in\r\nwith a hassock, and D\'Arcy put a railway rug over his knees.\r\n\r\nWally, whose ideas of hospitality were of the old school, deemed it\r\nexpedient, while tea was being served, to engage his guest on the\r\nsubject of the weather.\r\n\r\n"Rather finer the last few days than it was the other week when it\r\nrained?" said he.  "Rollitt\'s having fine weather for his trip."\r\n\r\nThis was an artful way of introducing the topic of the hour.\r\n\r\n"Thank you kindly, yes.  He\'s bound to be somewheres, is my Alf,"\r\nreplied Mr Rollitt.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right; we\'re backing him up.  He made a ripping run for the\r\nSchool against Rendlesham.  He bashed the ball through the scrimmage,\r\nyou know, and then nipped it up right under their noses and ran it\r\nthrough.  They couldn\'t collar him, he bowled \'em over right and left,\r\nand danced on \'em, and landed the touch clean behind the post."\r\n\r\n"He meant no harm, young gents, didn\'t my Alf.  He ain\'t often wiolent,\r\nhe ain\'t.  There\'s no offence, I hope?" said the father, quite\r\noverwhelmed by this alarming recital.\r\n\r\n"No; it was a jolly good run.  You ought to have seen it; I and my lot\r\nwere up the oak, you know; we could have tucked you in.  My young\r\nbrother Percy and his Modern cads--k-i-d-s (I never can pronounce it)--\r\nwere on the steps."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the poor guest, feeling he ought to reciprocate the civility\r\nof his entertainers.  "Steps is nice things to be on when you ain\'t got\r\nnowheres else."\r\n\r\n"Tea!" shouted Fisher minor, who with Ashby had been busily charging the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nIt was now the turn of the hosts to be shy.  At this late period of the\r\nterm funds had run low, and extras were at a premium.  A busy hour had\r\nbeen spent during the forenoon in both houses collecting outstanding\r\ndebts, contracting loans at the point of the sword, and laying out the\r\ncontents of the common purse at the shop in delicacies suitable to the\r\noccasion.  Abernethys and ham, of course, figured prominently.  The cake\r\nand jam was rather a "scratch lot," as they mostly consisted of\r\n"outsides" and "pot-ends" collected from various sources and amalgamated\r\ninto one stock.  But, to compensate for this, Wally had managed to get\r\nround the matron, and by representing to her the delicate nature of the\r\nentertainment, wheedled her out of a pot of "extra special" tea, and a\r\nsmall jug of cream.  For the rest, there were the relics of the "Cock-\r\nHouse" commissariat, a cocoa-nut, generously contributed by Fisher\r\nmajor, and the usual allowance of bread and butter.\r\n\r\nThe principal delicacy of the feast, however, was contributed by a fair\r\nlady, and to Percy belonged the honour and glory of its acquisition.\r\n\r\nOn his way from Hall he had run flop into the arms of Mrs Stratton, who\r\nwas carrying in her hands a small basket of hothouse grapes.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully sorry, I say, Mrs Stratton," said the culprit, as the\r\nbasket and its contents fell to the ground.  "So am I," said Mrs\r\nStratton.  "There\'s two bunches out of three not bashed," said Percy, on\r\nhis knees picking up the ruin.  "I say, Mrs Stratton, if you\'d let me\r\npay for the other I can give you twopence a week, beginning next week.\r\nI\'d rather, you know."\r\n\r\nMrs Stratton laughed pleasantly.  It was always a satisfaction, she\r\ntold her husband, to come into collision with a junior.  He always got\r\nthe best of it.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, Wheatfield.  But I tell you what you must do."\r\n\r\n"All serene, Mrs Stratton," said Percy submissively, preparing himself\r\nfor a hundred lines at least.\r\n\r\n"One of the bunches is damaged.  You must take it and get your friends\r\nto help you eat it.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\nOn the whole, therefore, the spread provided for Mr Rollitt was a\r\nrespectable one, and not likely to do discredit to his entertainers.\r\n\r\nHe was installed in the place of honour in the fender, Wally occupying\r\nthe seat in the passage, the others ranging themselves on either side of\r\nthe board.  They watched their guest\'s eye somewhat anxiously, to detect\r\nin it any signs of predilection for any particular dish.  But he, poor\r\nman, was too bewildered by the novel experience he was undergoing to\r\nbetray any symptoms of appetite.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll you have?" said Percy, presently.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'ve got a bit of bread and cheese and a drop of something,\r\nI don\'t mind, thank you kindly."\r\n\r\nThis was rather a damper; but Wally was equal to the emergency.\r\n\r\n"Have an Abernethy--that\'s what Rollitt\'s been living on.  You\'ll like\r\nit.  We keep a stock in our shop."\r\n\r\n"Only a penny each," said Ramshaw, explanatorily.\r\n\r\n"Better have some jam with it," said Cottle.\r\n\r\n"Like some tea?" inquired D\'Arcy, who had charge of the pot, beginning\r\nto fill up a mug the size of the slop-basin with the matron\'s "extra\r\nspecial."\r\n\r\n"The cake\'s not so bad--there\'s several lumps not a bit stale," said\r\nAshby.\r\n\r\n"If you like cocoa-nut," said Fisher minor, "my brother\'s lent us one,\r\nand I\'ll cut you a chunk."\r\n\r\n"And there\'s some grapes for you, when you\'re ready," said Percy,\r\nproudly; "a present from a lady."\r\n\r\nThe awkward thing was that, in their eagerness to see their guest eat,\r\nnone of the juniors took anything.  They continued to pile up the good\r\nman\'s plate till he didn\'t know where to begin, and fairly bewildered\r\nhim by each commending the excellence of his own particular delicacy\r\n"Thank\'ee, young gents.  I ain\'t much of a eater when I\'m away from\r\nhome; no more ain\'t my Alf.  But I\'ll take a snack, anyhow."\r\n\r\nWhereupon, to their delight, he commenced an onslaught on the viands\r\nbefore him, every morsel he ate being followed by eighteen admiring eyes\r\ninto his mouth.  He made short work of the Abernethys and cake, tossed\r\noff the tea as if it were a thimbleful, jerked down the hunk of cocoa-\r\nnut, gulped the grapes, and generally gave the spectators an admirable\r\nand comprehensive performance.\r\n\r\nThey were charmed.  So much so, that out of sheer pleasure they began to\r\neat too.  The meal, if brief, was a merry one.  Mr Rollitt took a\r\nspecial fancy to the Abernethys--a choice which of course put the shop-\r\ndirectors in an ecstasy.  They only reproached themselves that they had\r\nnot provided twelve instead of six.\r\n\r\nAt length, partly because there was nothing left but lukewarm water and\r\nthe toughest crusts of the cake, and partly because the guest\'s appetite\r\nwas beginning to flag, the solid portion of the meal came to an end, and\r\nthe social began.\r\n\r\nAfter sundry nudgings and whisperings and signals among the juniors,\r\nWally filled up his cup with warm water and rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "I--you know--that is--shut up, young\r\nCash, unless you want to do it--instead of me--it\'s this way, you see,\r\nyou chaps: I sort of think we ought to drink the health of Rollitt\'s\r\ngovernor.  He\'s a good old sort, and we\'re backing up old Rollitt.  It\r\nwasn\'t a very grand spread.  There\'d have been some sardines if you\'d\r\ncome last week; but that greedy pig D\'Arcy--"\r\n\r\n"Go on; it was _you_ finished them, three in two gulps," protested the\r\noutraged D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"Look here, young D\'Arcy," said Wally, seriously, "am I making this\r\nspeech, or are you.  If you don\'t shut up, I\'ll jolly well make you.--We\r\nhope you\'ve liked it, and don\'t mind our drinking your health, you know.\r\nIt\'ll be jolly when old Rollitt turns up.  We\'d ask you again to-\r\nmorrow, you know, only the grub\'s run short.  Therefore, I have much\r\npleasure in proposing your health."\r\n\r\nThe toast was drunk with acclamation, the party joining in "For he\'s a\r\njolly good fellow," much to the alarm of the occupants of the\r\nneighbouring studies, who flocked out in the passage to see what the\r\nnoise was about.\r\n\r\nWally assured them there was no grub left, so they needn\'t hang about;\r\nbut a good many of them remained all the same, to hear Mr Rollitt\'s\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee kindly, young masters," began he, with his usual formula; "I\r\nain\'t no schollard like my Alf is.  He could talk to you straight.  I\'m\r\nsorry he ain\'t here, gents.  He\'s bound to be somewheres, and I\'m sure\r\nit\'s no offence meant, his going away.  I likes your style, and I hopes\r\nthat young fly-by-night who says my Alf\'s a thief will tell him so to\r\nhis face.  My Alf\'ll settle him proper.  Them as pays for my Alf\'s\r\nschooling--which it\'s two kind ladies, masters, as my missus was kinder\r\nfoster-sister to--means to make a gent of my Alf.  But, bless you, he\'d\r\nsooner be along of me in the building trade.  Not that my Alf ain\'t a\r\nschollard, and can\'t behave himself.  He do behave beautiful to his\r\nmother, does Alf, and ain\'t nothink of a fine gent at home.  So there, I\r\ntell you straight, and no offence meant, young masters.  I like your\r\nstyle, I do.  Don\'t you take on about my Alf bein\' a-missing.  He\'s\r\nbound to be somewheres.  I know\'d him do it afore, when things went\r\ncontrairy.  But he wasn\'t fur off, and come back.  On\'y don\'t let \'im\r\ncop hold of that there jumper as says he\'s a thief, or there\'ll be a row\r\nin the \'ouse.  Why, my Alf\'s that straight he wouldn\'t rob a dog of his\r\nbone, not if he was starving.  That\'s flat.  So here\'s to you, young\r\ngents; and if you happen to be passing near Crackstoke way, me and my\r\nmissus\'ll be proud to see yer.  Here\'s luck!"\r\n\r\nThe speech was rapturously applauded, not only by the party present, but\r\nby the knot of fellows in the passage, who were taking advantage of the\r\nnecessarily open door to join in the proceedings as outsiders.\r\n\r\nWally, however, resented the intrusion, and as soon as the speech of the\r\nevening was ended, ordered one of the tables to be cleared, and placing\r\nhis chair upon it, made room for the door to be closed on the intruders,\r\nmuch to their disappointment.\r\n\r\nAfter the favourable reception of his speech, Mr Rollitt became very\r\nmuch more at home, and produced a pipe from his pocket, which he\r\nproceeded in the most natural way to light.  His hosts gazed in a\r\nsomewhat awe-struck way at the proceeding, but Wally gave the right cue.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Mr Rollitt; make yourself at home."\r\n\r\n"So I are.  You see, in my days, schooling worn\'t what it is.  Now this\r\nhere school must be a topper."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not bad," said Percy.  "You see there was a jolly row on this term\r\nbetween the Classics and our lot, and they had to be taken down a bit."\r\n\r\n"_Did_ they?" retorted Wally, very indignant; "how many pegs did _you_\r\ncome down?  Who had to get our chaps to come and give them a leg-up\r\nevery other day?"\r\n\r\n"Who swindled at Elections and got licked on the hands, eh!"\r\n\r\n"Who got their football bagged, and couldn\'t get it back?"\r\n\r\n"Who got kicked out of the front row at the Rendlesham match?"\r\n\r\n"\'Armony, gents, \'armony," said Mr Rollitt, waving his pipe\r\nencouragingly.\r\n\r\nThe rebuke was opportune.  It wasn\'t fair to the guest to squabble\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve stashed all that," said Percy, presently; "they got civil to us,\r\nso we got civil to them, and we\'re all in the shop together.  And we\'re\r\nall backing up old Rollitt, ain\'t we, you chaps, and we\'re going down in\r\na lump for the clubs; and we all shelled out for this do; so it\'s all\r\nright now.  See?"\r\n\r\nMr Rollitt thought he did, and nodded amiably.\r\n\r\n"You see, it\'s not much larks unless we\'re all in it.  We went up Hawk\'s\r\nPike, you know."\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr Rollitt.  "How did that happen?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it was this way, you see," began Percy, taking up, as was his\r\nwont, the narrative at a remote period.  "After those Classic cads--k-i-\r\nd-s, you know, had--(Shut up, Wally, I said k-i-d-s; can\'t you spell?)\r\nhad caved in."\r\n\r\n"Who caved in!" expostulated the Classics.\r\n\r\n"Well, after Stratton\'s, you know, when we started the shop--I say,\r\nyou\'ll have to come and see the shop--well--it was before that, though;\r\nit was when the row began about Corder not being stuck in--that was\r\nbefore that, you know--Brinkman screwed his foot, so there was a man\r\nshort for the team, so Clapperton--that\'s our prefect, you know; he\'s\r\nall right now, but he--hullo, I say, he\'s gone asleep!"\r\n\r\nSure enough Mr Rollitt, weary with his long journey, with the\r\nexcitement of the day, and with the excellence of the tea, had dozed off\r\ncomfortably, on his chair in the fender, with his pipe in his mouth.\r\n\r\nPercy felt it unnecessary to pursue his lucid narrative, and the nine\r\nhosts sat watching their man as his head nodded forward, and the urgent\r\nnecessity for a snore presently rendered the position of the pipe no\r\nlonger tenable.\r\n\r\nIt was a triumph!  No man could have gone off like that unless he had\r\nfelt thoroughly comfortable.  The railway rug was again produced and\r\nlaid over his knees, and his feet were gently lifted on the hassock, and\r\na pillow was neatly inserted at the back of the chair; and all looked so\r\nsnug, and the hospitable juniors were so pleased with the result, that\r\nthey had the vanity to let the door stand open, so that all who passed\r\nby might see how comfortable they could make a guest when they liked.\r\n\r\nTo heighten the effect, they decided to do their preparation on the\r\nspot, and so not only impress the sleeper when he awoke, but advertise\r\nthemselves to the outside world as boys who by no means neglected the\r\nserious side of school life for its lighter functions.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that next day when the work thus accomplished was\r\nsubjected to the microscopic test of the master\'s eyes, it was not any\r\nbetter--some said it was even worse--than usual.  That had nothing to do\r\nwith the present.\r\n\r\nWally, who put his chair out again in the passage, had most of his time\r\noccupied in making pantomimic appeals for silence from passers-by, to\r\nwhom he pointed out the figure of the sleeping Mr Rollitt as a\r\njustification.  The others, debarred from speech (for it was considered\r\nthat even a whisper might awaken the sleeper, although the violent\r\nprocess of tucking him up just now had failed to do so), were reduced to\r\ncommunication with one another in writing, which took up so much time\r\nand paper that very little of either was left for lessons.\r\n\r\nAt last, after half an hour\'s suspense, the clang of the house-bell for\r\ncall-over broke the spell.  Mr Rollitt grunted and yawned and opened\r\nhis eyes, looked about for his pipe, inspected the rug on his knees,\r\ntook his feet off the hassock, and finally realised where he was.\r\n\r\n"I was nigh \'andy asleep that time," said he, rummaging in his pocket\r\nfor a lucifer.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right; we were doing our prep, you know.  Now we\'ve got to be\r\ncalled over.  If you stick here, we\'ll be back in a jiffy, and then\r\nwe\'ll take you to see the shop," said Wally.\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee kindly," said the guest; "don\'t put yourselves about for me.\r\nTake your time, young gents."\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t be long.  I say, wait for us, won\'t you?  Don\'t you go out\r\nwith any other chaps.  They ain\'t in it, you know."\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t a-going with nobody, don\'t you make no mistake," was the\r\nvisitor\'s satisfactory assurance.\r\n\r\nThey had some thoughts about locking him in, to make sure of him, but\r\ndecided to trust his parole, and trooped down impatiently to call-over,\r\nbinding one another to assemble at the shop immediately afterwards,\r\nwhither Wally and Percy were to conduct their guest.\r\n\r\nTo the satisfaction of these young gentlemen, the bird was safely in his\r\ncage when they returned, dimly visible through the smoke, looking at the\r\npictures in the illustrated paper.  He meekly obeyed their summons,\r\nrelieving their embarrassment somewhat by putting his pipe away in his\r\npocket as he rose.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the rest of the pals?" asked he.\r\n\r\n"Down at the shop.  It\'s not the regular hour, you know.  But we can get\r\nin with the key.  Come along, Mr Rollitt."\r\n\r\nThe old Watch-Tower, which, as the reader knows, is the oldest remaining\r\nportion of Fellsgarth, was rather an imposing-looking edifice for so\r\nmundane an establishment as the School shop.  The shop, indeed, occupied\r\nonly a small apartment on the ground floor, which had previously been\r\nused as a porter\'s lodge, the remainder of the structure, including the\r\ndisused belfry and watch-turret, being abandoned to the owls and ghosts\r\nand ivy, which accorded best with the ancient traditions of the place.\r\n\r\nMr Rollitt, whose profession sharpened his observation for specimens of\r\nbygone achievements in his own line of business, noted the venerable\r\nexterior before him with admiration.\r\n\r\n"That there bit of bricks and mortar," said he, "warn\'t built\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s millions of years old," said Wally; "but our shop, you know,\r\nhas only just been started."\r\n\r\n"They don\'t make copin\'s like them to-day," repeated Mr Rollitt.\r\n\r\n"We go in for good grub cheap," said Percy; "no shoe-leather, like Bob\r\nused to sell."\r\n\r\n"I reckon them top courses is a hundred year after this here bottom\r\npart.  Not much jerry there neither."\r\n\r\n"We boss it among us, you know," said Wally, "and take turns to serve.\r\nWe don\'t get a bad profit either."\r\n\r\nHere they were joined by the rest of the party.  But to their\r\ndisappointment Mr Rollitt\'s interest in the shop was small compared\r\nwith that he showed in the lay of the bricks, the run of the beams, and\r\nthe hardness of the mortar.\r\n\r\n"They knowed their way about, straight, those days," said he, picking\r\naway between two of the bricks with his nail.\r\n\r\n"Try one of our `Rollitt\'s particular,\'" pleaded D\'Arcy, in the hope\r\nthat this invitation at least would interest him.\r\n\r\nBut no.  He went "nosing round," taking no notice of the stores, and\r\nputting off all invitations with a "Thank\'ee kindly, not to-day."\r\n\r\nIt was a sore blow to his hosts.  After what they had done for him,\r\nafter the way they had nursed him all day, after the tea they had given\r\nhim, and the pipes he had smoked in their study!  They could have thrown\r\nhim overboard in their mortification.  But the dread lest some one else,\r\nsome of the middle-boys, for instance, should get hold of him and "run"\r\nhim, decided them to pocket their feelings and back him up still.\r\n\r\n"No offence, young gents," said he presently; "but if you\'ve a ladder\r\n\'andy, I\'d like to take a look up there."\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s nothing up there--only bats and owls," said Wally, "and\r\nthere\'s no ladder."\r\n\r\nBut Mr Rollitt pointed out in a corner, behind the back of the shop,\r\nsome protruding bits of stone let into the brick, evidently with a view\r\nto form a rude ladder or stair to the chambers above.\r\n\r\nThis promised well.  An exploration of the Watch-tower offered some\r\nlittle compensation for the slight put on their shop.\r\n\r\n"I never saw that before," said Wally.  "I vote we go up."\r\n\r\nMr Rollitt led the way with all the agility of a practical hodman.  The\r\nsteps ended with a trap-door in the ceiling, which he pushed up before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Mind how you go, young gents," said he to his followers; "one at a time\r\non them stones."\r\n\r\nThe trap-door opened into a sort of passage, at the end of which was a\r\nnarrow brick corkscrew staircase.\r\n\r\nIt was too dark to do anything but feel their way up; Mr Rollitt\r\nleading, and testing every step as he went along.\r\n\r\n"Why," said Wally suddenly, and with a touch of alarm in his voice, as\r\nthey were halting a moment to allow Mr Rollitt to inspect with the end\r\nof a lucifer one of the loophole windows, "why, look up there--there\'s a\r\nlight!"\r\n\r\nThey looked.  And there, struggling apparently from under a door which\r\nclosed the head of the stairs, came a streak of light.\r\n\r\n"I say--it\'s ghosts," said Fisher minor.  "Let\'s go back."\r\n\r\n"More likely it\'s my Alf," said Mr Rollitt.  "I know\'d he was\r\nsomewheres not fur off."\r\n\r\nHe went up, followed at a more respectful distance than before by the\r\nboys, and pushed open the door.\r\n\r\nThey heard the sound of an exclamation within, and a noise as of some\r\none starting to his feet.  Next moment, as the light streamed down the\r\nstaircase, they heard a familiar voice say--\r\n\r\n"Father!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s me, Alf, my boy; I know\'d you was somewheres \'andy."\r\n\r\n"I say," said Wally, in an excited whisper to his followers, "we\'d best\r\ncut back, you chaps.  They don\'t want us up there."\r\n\r\nThe delicate suggestion was appreciated by the party, who forthwith made\r\na precipitate retreat.\r\n\r\n"We as good as found him, that\'s one thing, and nobody else was in it,"\r\nsaid Percy triumphantly.\r\n\r\n"Rather not.  Keep it mum.  Let\'s go and light the fire in his room, and\r\nhave some grub ready for him.  Good old Rollitt, I\'m jolly glad he\'s\r\nturned up!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s how he got the Abernethys," said D\'Arcy.  "Jolly honest to pay\r\nfor them."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t suppose anybody would collar things out of the shop and not\r\npay for them, you lout, do you?"\r\n\r\nWhereat, leaving the door on the latch, they marched arm in arm across\r\nthe School Green kicking every junior they met, and mystifying everybody\r\nby whistling at the top of their voices, "See the conquering hero\r\ncomes."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL KICK.\r\n\r\nRollitt\'s return to Fellsgarth was almost as mysterious as his\r\ndisappearance.  He answered to his name at call-over next morning as if\r\nhe had never missed a day this term.  And as Dr Ringwood and the other\r\nmasters were present, and made no remark, it was generally concluded\r\nthat the truant had turned up over-night, and had had it out with the\r\nauthorities before bedtime.\r\n\r\nMr Rollitt, Senior, had departed.  He had looked into Wally\'s study\r\nafter the owner and his crew were in bed to get his bag, and had been\r\ndriven down in the doctor\'s fly to Penchurch.\r\n\r\nIt was also understood that most of the Classic seniors had dropped into\r\nRollitt\'s study early that morning.  To some he had said, "Get out";\r\nwith others he had shaken hands.  The captain had evidently been among\r\nthe latter; as, on the notice board that morning, among the names of the\r\nfifteen who were to play the first match for the new clubs on Saturday\r\nagainst Penchurch, was that of Rollitt.  The excitement caused by this\r\ndiscovery almost put into the shade for the time the equally remarkable\r\nfact that Clapperton and Brinkman were included in the same team.\r\n\r\nWhere Rollitt had been, and what he had been doing, remained a mystery.\r\nIt was, of course, out of the question to ask him.  Conjecture was rife,\r\nand was greatly assisted by the juniors, who hazarded all sorts of\r\nplausible explanations for the general benefit.\r\n\r\n"Think he\'s been to Land\'s End?" said Wally.  "I hear you can do it in a\r\nweek--sharp walking."\r\n\r\n"You can get to America in that time," said Lickford.\r\n\r\n"Yes--he does seem to have rather a twang on him.  Perhaps that\'s where\r\nhe\'s been to," remarked D\'Arcy.\r\n\r\n"Penny bank coal-mine\'s only fifty miles away," said Percy.  "It runs\r\nunder the sea ever so far.  I should say it was a ripping place to hide\r\nin."\r\n\r\nFrom which and other similar remarks it was concluded that the juniors\r\nhad a much better notion as to where Rollitt had been than they chose to\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\nThey eagerly embraced the first opportunity of going to the shop, and\r\ninvestigating the scene of the mystery for themselves.  They carefully\r\nlocked the outer door against possible intruders, and then in Indian\r\nfile ascended the stone ladder, and after it the corkscrew staircase.\r\n\r\nThe room in which they found themselves was pretty much as Rollitt had\r\nleft it.  It had evidently been made use of by a former lodge-keeper as\r\na dwelling-room, for there was a ragged paper on the wall, and an\r\nattempt here and there to board over dangerous holes in the floor.\r\nBesides which there was a rude shutter to the tiny window, by means of\r\nwhich no doubt Rollitt had succeeded in concealing his presence at\r\nnight.  The remains of a wood fire were on the hearth, and a candle-end\r\nshowed (what they already knew) that the hermit did not spend all his\r\nevenings in darkness.\r\n\r\nMore than this, in one corner still lay some of the wraps which he had\r\nevidently used to extemporise a bed.  And an empty box on end in the\r\nwindow convinced them he had sat down during part of his residence.\r\nThere was also a leaf of exercise paper and a Horace lying on the floor,\r\nwhich evidently had not been brought there by the owls.  Altogether, as\r\nthey looked round, they concluded that, but for the cold, he might have\r\nhad worse quarters during his temporary exile.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery that delighted them most was a fragment of a newspaper\r\nin which were wrapped the not yet exhausted end of a ham, and half a\r\nbiscuit!\r\n\r\nOver these relics they dwelt with quite an affectionate interest, till\r\nsomebody said--\r\n\r\n"What did he have to drink?  He didn\'t take any of our ginger-beer, and\r\nthere\'s no water here."\r\n\r\n"Why, you duffer, of course he could get out any time he liked.  It\'s\r\nonly a latch on the door; any one can open it from inside.  He could\r\neasily get down to the river in the night, and have a tub, and fetch up\r\nsome water."\r\n\r\nThey decided that in future the shop committee, except when Mr and Mrs\r\nStratton were present, should meet nowhere but in "Rollitt\'s chamber,"\r\nas they forthwith named the room, and proceeded to dedicate it to that\r\nuse there and then.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," said Wally, "that after we pay back Mr Stratton what he\r\nlent us to start with, there\'ll be a clear L5 to give to the clubs out\r\nof the profits?"\r\n\r\n"Not bad," said Percy.  "They ought to put us in the first fifteen for\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said D\'Arcy; "they\'ve got a jolly hot fifteen for\r\nSaturday, Rollitt and all of \'em.  We ought to put the Penchurch chaps\r\nto bed for once, I fancy."\r\n\r\nThis was the general impression throughout the School; and, as if to\r\nmake up for the abstinence of the past few weeks, the fervour of the\r\nathletic set waxed high as the eventful day drew near.  Yorke had out\r\nhis men once or twice, practising kicks, and selecting where in the\r\nfield each player could work to best advantage.\r\n\r\nRollitt, of course, did not attend these practices; but Clapperton and\r\nBrinkman did, and soon lost the embarrassment with which they first\r\nfaced their old rivals and enemies.  Corder was down too; dreadfully\r\nafraid lest by _some_ mishap he should discredit himself, and so be\r\nknocked out of his coveted place in the team.  Mr Stratton was on the\r\nspot also, advising and admonishing--as no one knew better how to do.\r\nEven the doctor showed his interest in the new departure of the clubs by\r\ncoming down too, and by giving directions to reserve seats in the\r\npavilion for a party of his friends.\r\n\r\nThe only unenthusiastic person, except Rollitt, was Dangle.  He tried at\r\nfirst to brazen it out, and came down to the field with a sneer on his\r\nface to look, so he said, "at the good boys exercising themselves."  But\r\nthe juniors soon routed him out of that attitude.\r\n\r\n"Booh, hoo!  Rollitt\'s coming!  Wants to hear you call him a thief.\r\nRun--he\'ll catch you!  Put it on, well run, Dangle, you\'ve missed him\r\nthis time.  Coast\'s clear, now; you can come back.  We\'ll protect you,"\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nThese attentions made Dangle\'s visits to the field less frequent.  In\r\nschool, he kept the swagger up still longer.\r\n\r\n"So," said he one day to Clapperton, "I thought you didn\'t approve of\r\ncutting fellows dead?"\r\n\r\n"No more I do."\r\n\r\n"Why do you do it, then?"\r\n\r\n"Have you apologised to Rollitt?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Has Rollitt thrashed you?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"When one or the other has happened, I shall be delighted to shake\r\nhands," said Clapperton.\r\n\r\nThe alternative was a dismal one, but Dangle saw no third way.  Which\r\ncourse was least to be desired he could not for the life of him decide.\r\nA fight with Rollitt he knew would end disastrously.  But to apologise--\r\nand in public!\r\n\r\nThe reader has already had two football matches in the course of this\r\nstory.  He shall not be wearied with a third.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say the Penchurch men--men, not boys--presented themselves\r\non the appointed day, and all Fellsgarth turned out to see the battle.\r\n\r\nFisher minor scored one more triumph by bringing Rollitt up to the\r\nscratch, and so completing as sound and taut a team as Yorke had ever\r\nled on to victory.\r\n\r\nMrs Stratton was there, wearing the School colours round her hat; and\r\nthe doctor was there with his field-glasses, pointing out the heroes of\r\nthe School to his distinguished visitors.\r\n\r\nThis time, by much squeezing and mutual accommodation, the oak tree was\r\nmade to hold nine persons.  Who those nine were none could guess, unless\r\nindeed they happened to be standing within a hundred yards of the spot\r\nwithout cotton-wool in their ears.\r\n\r\nFrom the first it went hard with the Penchurch men.  The School had\r\nnever played up better.  The scrimmages were beautifully packed, and the\r\nquarter and half-backs were never off the spot.  Only when, above the\r\ncrowd, Rollitt\'s head was seen to be at work, and it was apparent he had\r\nwaked up for a time, was there any risk of confusion.  But Yorke\'s "Play\r\non Rollitt!" generally pulled the scrimmage together again, and warned\r\nfriend and (after a time) foe what to expect.\r\n\r\nThere was no holding Rollitt back when he once made up his mind to get\r\nthe ball through; and no stopping him when once he got fairly started on\r\na run.  Twice before half-time and once after he scored a touch-down.\r\nTwice Yorke did the same, and once Clapperton.\r\n\r\nCorder discovered that a fellow does not always score, and yet may play\r\na steady, useful game.  He was disappointed that it was only left him to\r\ndo the latter; and he set himself down as a failure.  But Mr Stratton\r\nput him on his feet wonderfully at the end.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve improved, Corder.  You never played as well."\r\n\r\nThe others worked well, and contributed to the great result, and\r\nperhaps, better still, grudged no one his greater glory.  It was\r\nFellsgarth that was playing, not Fullerton, Ranger, Brinkman, Fisher\r\nmajor, or anybody else.\r\n\r\nThe final goal was Clapperton\'s.  It was an historic event.  For the\r\nfirst time in the match the Penchurch men had worked the ball up into\r\nthe boys\' quarters, and fears were being entertained lest, after all,\r\nthey would save their "duck."  The half-backs and quarter-backs of the\r\nSchool were squeezed in, all of a lump, between touch and goal; and\r\nthose who looked on noticed with alarm that, as matters now stood, an\r\neasy drop-kick from any of the enemy\'s forwards might capture the goal.\r\n\r\nRollitt was the first to put an end to this dangerous state of things.\r\nHe bore down the scrimmage after his usual fashion, and succeeded, as he\r\nbroke through, in getting the ball into his hands.  But for once he\r\ncould get no further.  Twenty hands seized him and carried him to the\r\nground, but not before he had sent back the ball into Fisher\'s hands.\r\n\r\n"Back up now--hard and fast!" cried Yorke.\r\n\r\nNever was order more beautifully carried out, Fisher minor held the\r\nleather long enough to pass it to Brinkman.  Brinkman staggered on a\r\nyard or two and slipped it back to Denton.  Denton made a yard or two\r\nmore and passed it to Corder.  Corder fell back with it into the arms of\r\nRanger.  Ranger let Corder drop, but captured the ball, and with one of\r\nhis lightning swoops carried it out of the ruck for twenty yards, when,\r\nas he fell, Yorke came up and captured it.  Yorke, alas, was cut short\r\nin his career before he had gone ten yards, but Clapperton was there to\r\ntake it.  Away he went, shaking off the nearest of his assailants and\r\ndistancing others, till he too fell gloriously, with his body in play,\r\nand his hands in touch, thirty yards from the enemy\'s lines.  The\r\nserried ranks formed up on either side.  Clapperton, as he stood, ball\r\nin hand, ready to throw in, passed his eye along the line of his\r\nfriends, and stopped short of Yorke.  Yorke understood.  He caught the\r\nball, and quick as thought, returned it to Clapperton, who, swooping\r\nround behind the line, got clear with it once more, and crossing the\r\nfield, curving in all the way, carried into the enemy\'s lines at their\r\nfar corner, whence with a wide sweep he brought it round right behind\r\ntheir posts, a beautiful climax to a beautiful piece of co-operative\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Stratton said, nothing all that term had been more hopeful of the\r\nnew spirit of mutual confidence and support in the School than this\r\ntriumphant rally.\r\n\r\nBut the goal was yet to be kicked.  To Yorke, of course, belonged the\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nBut Yorke, to every one\'s surprise, stood out.\r\n\r\n"No," said he.  "It\'s Clapperton\'s goal; he shall kick it."\r\n\r\nSo Fellsgarth, perhaps for the first and only time in its records, stood\r\nby and witnessed the phenomenon of its captain carrying out the ball and\r\nplacing it for the vice-captain to kick.\r\n\r\nIt needed all Clapperton\'s nerve to save him from flurry and failure\r\neven over an easy task like this.  But he pulled himself together and\r\nkicked the goal.\r\n\r\nAnd with that kick he sent flying into the air the last remnant of the\r\nbad blood and jealousy which had marred the term and all but wrecked the\r\ngood old School.\r\n\r\nHere let us say good-bye--perhaps not for good.  For Yorke and Rollitt,\r\nand Clapperton and Fisher, and all of them, are still alive and kicking.\r\n\r\nRollitt, to the general regret, but to his own satisfaction, left\r\nFellsgarth at the end of the term for the more congenial course of a\r\nschool of engineering.  Before he left he invited Fisher minor to tea in\r\nhis room, and alarmed that young gentleman by sitting for a whole hour\r\nwithout uttering a word.  At length, when the guest had to leave, he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Fisher minor.  Thank those fellows of yours.  Tell Yorke the\r\nmoney that bought the boat was what I had been saving for something\r\nelse.  I\'ll write to you.  Get out, now."\r\n\r\nThat was the last of Rollitt.\r\n\r\nDangle never made up his mind either to apologise or take a thrashing.\r\nHe never met Rollitt after the return of the latter.  When breaking-up\r\nday came, he got an excuse to go home earlier than the general crowd;\r\nand when School reassembled in January it was known he had left\r\nFellsgarth for good.\r\n\r\nThe two events of the breaking-up "Hall" were--first the announcement by\r\nthe doctor that, at his request, Yorke would stay on another term at\r\nFellsgarth; secondly, the presentation of a purse containing five pounds\r\nto the School clubs by the nine juniors, as the profits for the term on\r\nthe business of the School shop.\r\n\r\nWhich of these two events produced the more terrific cheers the reader\r\nmust take upon himself to decide.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Messrs. Wally, D\'Arcy, Ashby, Fisher minor, Percy,\r\nCottle, Lickford, Ramshaw, and Cash, limited, walked arm in arm across\r\nthe Green, after a farewell call on Mrs Stratton, on their way to the\r\nSchool omnibus, which waited at the Watch-Tower.  Their progress was\r\ntemporarily interrupted by the sudden bolt of Fisher minor in pursuit of\r\na lank, cadaverous figure, wearing the Modern colours, who was strolling\r\ninnocently off in the direction of Mr Forder\'s house.\r\n\r\n"The young un\'s got \'em again," said Wally.  "Here, come back, young\r\nFisher minor, can\'t you?  We shan\'t wait."\r\n\r\nFisher minor pulled up.  He looked wistfully first at the retreating\r\nfigure in the distance, then at his eight friends.  With a sigh he\r\ndecided on the latter; and for that term, at least, finally abandoned\r\nthe quest of his unlucky half-crown.\r\n\r\nIt took some little time to arrange matters on the omnibus, as one or\r\ntwo innocent middle-boys had had the audacity to occupy the box-seat and\r\nthe row behind, and had to be cajoled or pulled down.  How could any one\r\ndare, when those two seats just held nine, to imagine that they were not\r\nsacred property?\r\n\r\n"That\'s better," said Wally, when at last the party were safely up, with\r\ntwo rugs over their eighteen knees, and a gross of brandy-balls\r\ncirculating for the common comfort.  "Touch \'em up, driver.  Give \'em\r\ntheir heads!  I tell you what, you chaps, this has been rather a slow\r\nhalf.  I vote we have some larks next term."\r\n\r\n"Rather!" chimed in the chorus.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Cock-House at Fellsgarth, by Talbot Baines Reed\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COCK-HOUSE AT FELLSGARTH ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 21037.txt or 21037.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/0/3/21037/\r\n\r\nProduced by Nick Hodson of London, England\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
