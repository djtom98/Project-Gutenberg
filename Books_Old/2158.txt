But not the less\r\nmust the offspring of the washerwoman have had very much trouble on\r\nthe subject of his birth, unless he has been, when young as well as\r\nwhen old, a very great man indeed. After the goal has been absolutely\r\nreached, and the honour and the titles and the wealth actually\r\nwon, a man may talk with some humour, even with some affection, of\r\nthe maternal tub;--but while the struggle is going on, with the\r\nconviction strong upon the struggler that he cannot be altogether\r\nsuccessful unless he be esteemed a gentleman, not to be ashamed,\r\nnot to conceal the old family circumstances, not at any rate to be\r\nsilent, is difficult. And the difficulty is certainly not less if\r\nfortunate circumstances rather than hard work and intrinsic merit\r\nhave raised above his natural place an aspirant to high social\r\nposition. Can it be expected that such a one when dining with a\r\nduchess shall speak of his father\'s small shop, or bring into the\r\nlight of day his grandfather\'s cobbler\'s awl? And yet it is difficult\r\nto be altogether silent! It may not be necessary for any of us to be\r\nalways talking of our own parentage. We may be generally reticent as\r\nto our uncles and aunts, and may drop even our brothers and sisters\r\nin our ordinary conversation. But if a man never mentions his\r\nbelongings among those with whom he lives, he becomes mysterious,\r\nand almost open to suspicion. It begins to be known that nobody\r\nknows anything of such a man, and even friends become afraid. It is\r\ncertainly convenient to be able to allude, if it be but once in a\r\nyear, to some blood relation.\r\n\r\nFerdinand Lopez, who in other respects had much in his circumstances\r\non which to congratulate himself, suffered trouble in his mind\r\nrespecting his ancestors such as I have endeavoured to describe. He\r\ndid not know very much himself, but what little he did know he kept\r\naltogether to himself. He had no father or mother, no uncle, aunt,\r\nbrother or sister, no cousin even whom he could mention in a cursory\r\nway to his dearest friend. He suffered, no doubt;--but with Spartan\r\nconsistency he so hid his trouble from the world that no one knew\r\nthat he suffered. Those with whom he lived, and who speculated often\r\nand wondered much as to who he was, never dreamed that the silent\r\nman\'s reticence was a burden to himself. At no special conjuncture of\r\nhis life, at no period which could be marked with the finger of the\r\nobserver, did he glaringly abstain from any statement which at the\r\nmoment might be natural. He never hesitated, blushed, or palpably\r\nlaboured at concealment; but the fact remained that though a great\r\nmany men and not a few women knew Ferdinand Lopez very well, none of\r\nthem knew whence he had come, or what was his family.\r\n\r\nHe was a man, however, naturally reticent, who never alluded to his\r\nown affairs unless in pursuit of some object the way to which was\r\nclear before his eyes. Silence therefore on a matter which is common\r\nin the mouths of most men was less difficult to him than to another,\r\nand the result less embarrassing. Dear old Jones, who tells his\r\nfriends at the club of every pound that he loses or wins at the\r\nraces, who boasts of Mary\'s favours and mourns over Lucy\'s coldness\r\nalmost in public, who issues bulletins on the state of his purse, his\r\nstomach, his stable, and his debts, could not with any amount of care\r\nkeep from us the fact that his father was an attorney\'s clerk, and\r\nmade his first money by discounting small bills. Everybody knows\r\nit, and Jones, who likes popularity, grieves at the unfortunate\r\npublicity. But Jones is relieved from a burden which would have\r\nbroken his poor shoulders, and which even Ferdinand Lopez, who is a\r\nstrong man, often finds it hard to bear without wincing.\r\n\r\nIt was admitted on all sides that Ferdinand Lopez was a "gentleman."\r\nJohnson says that any other derivation of this difficult word than\r\nthat which causes it to signify "a man of ancestry" is whimsical.\r\nThere are many, who in defining the term for their own use, still\r\nadhere to Johnson\'s dictum;--but they adhere to it with certain\r\nunexpressed allowances for possible exceptions. The chances are very\r\nmuch in favour of the well-born man, but exceptions may exist. It\r\nwas not generally believed that Ferdinand Lopez was well born;--but\r\nhe was a gentleman. And this most precious rank was acceded to\r\nhim although he was employed,--or at least had been employed,--on\r\nbusiness which does not of itself give such a warrant of position as\r\nis supposed to be afforded by the bar and the church, by the military\r\nservices and by physic. He had been on the Stock Exchange, and still\r\nin some manner, not clearly understood by his friends, did business\r\nin the City.\r\n\r\nAt the time with which we are now concerned Ferdinand Lopez was\r\nthirty-three years old, and as he had begun life early he had been\r\nlong before the world. It was known of him that he had been at a good\r\nEnglish private school, and it was reported, on the solitary evidence\r\nof one who had there been his schoolfellow, that a rumour was current\r\nin the school that his school bills were paid by an old gentleman\r\nwho was not related to him. Thence at the age of seventeen he had\r\nbeen sent to a German University, and at the age of twenty-one\r\nhad appeared in London, in a stockbroker\'s office, where he was\r\nsoon known as an accomplished linguist, and as a very clever\r\nfellow,--precocious, not given to many pleasures, apt for work, but\r\nhardly trustworthy by employers, not as being dishonest, but as\r\nhaving a taste for being a master rather than a servant. Indeed his\r\nperiod of servitude was very short. It was not in his nature to be\r\nactive on behalf of others. He was soon active for himself, and at\r\none time it was supposed that he was making a fortune. Then it was\r\nknown that he had left his regular business, and it was supposed that\r\nhe had lost all that he had ever made or had ever possessed. But\r\nnobody, not even his own bankers or his own lawyer,--not even the old\r\nwoman who looked after his linen,--ever really knew the state of his\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nHe was certainly a handsome man,--his beauty being of a sort which\r\nmen are apt to deny and women to admit lavishly. He was nearly six\r\nfeet tall, very dark, and very thin, with regular, well-cut features\r\nindicating little to the physiognomist unless it be the great gift of\r\nself-possession. His hair was cut short, and he wore no beard beyond\r\nan absolutely black moustache. His teeth were perfect in form and\r\nwhiteness,--a characteristic which, though it may be a valued item\r\nin a general catalogue of personal attraction, does not generally\r\nrecommend a man to the unconscious judgment of his acquaintance.\r\nBut about the mouth and chin of this man there was a something of\r\nsoftness, perhaps in the play of the lips, perhaps in the dimple,\r\nwhich in some degree lessened the feeling of hardness which was\r\nproduced by the square brow and bold, unflinching, combative eyes.\r\nThey who knew him and liked him were reconciled by the lower face.\r\nThe greater number who knew him and did not like him felt and\r\nresented,--even though in nine cases out of ten they might express no\r\nresentment even to themselves,--the pugnacity of his steady glance.\r\n\r\nFor he was essentially one of those men who are always, in the inner\r\nworkings of their minds, defending themselves and attacking others.\r\nHe could not give a penny to a woman at a crossing without a look\r\nwhich argued at full length her injustice in making her demand, and\r\nhis freedom from all liability let him walk the crossing as often as\r\nhe might. He could not seat himself in a railway carriage without a\r\nlesson to his opposite neighbour that in all the mutual affairs of\r\ntravelling, arrangement of feet, disposition of bags, and opening\r\nof windows, it would be that neighbour\'s duty to submit and his to\r\nexact. It was, however, for the spirit rather than for the thing\r\nitself that he combatted. The woman with the broom got her penny. The\r\nopposite gentleman when once by a glance he had expressed submission\r\nwas allowed his own way with his legs and with the window. I would\r\nnot say that Ferdinand Lopez was prone to do ill-natured things; but\r\nhe was imperious, and he had learned to carry his empire in his eye.\r\n\r\nThe reader must submit to be told one or two further and still\r\nsmaller details respecting the man, and then the man shall be allowed\r\nto make his own way. No one of those around him knew how much care he\r\ntook to dress himself well, or how careful he was that no one should\r\nknow it. His very tailor regarded him as being simply extravagant in\r\nthe number of his coats and trousers, and his friends looked upon him\r\nas one of those fortunate beings to whose nature belongs a facility\r\nof being well dressed, or almost an impossibility of being ill\r\ndressed. We all know the man,--a little man generally who moves\r\nseldom and softly,--who looks always as though he had just been sent\r\nhome in a bandbox. Ferdinand Lopez was not a little man, and moved\r\nfreely enough; but never, at any moment,--going into the city or\r\ncoming out of it, on horseback or on foot, at home over his book or\r\nafter the mazes of the dance,--was he dressed otherwise than with\r\nperfect care. Money and time did it, but folk thought that it grew\r\nwith him, as did his hair and his nails. And he always rode a horse\r\nwhich charmed good judges of what a park nag should be;--not a\r\nprancing, restless, giggling, sideway-going, useless garran, but an\r\nanimal well made, well bitted, with perfect paces, on whom a rider if\r\nit pleased him could be as quiet as a statue on a monument. It often\r\ndid please Ferdinand Lopez to be quiet on horseback; and yet he did\r\nnot look like a statue, for it was acknowledged through all London\r\nthat he was a good horseman. He lived luxuriously too,--though\r\nwhether at his ease or not nobody knew,--for he kept a brougham of\r\nhis own, and during the hunting season he had two horses down at\r\nLeighton. There had once been a belief abroad that he was ruined, but\r\nthey who interest themselves in such matters had found out,--or at\r\nany rate believed that they had found out,--that he paid his tailor\r\nregularly: and now there prevailed an opinion that Ferdinand Lopez\r\nwas a monied man.\r\n\r\nIt was known to some few that he occupied rooms in a flat at\r\nWestminster,--but to very few exactly where the rooms were situate.\r\nAmong all his friends no one was known to have entered them. In a\r\nmoderate way he was given to hospitality,--that is to infrequent but,\r\nwhen the occasion came, to graceful hospitality. Some club, however,\r\nor tavern, or perhaps, in the summer, some river bank would be chosen\r\nas the scene of these festivities. To a few,--if, as suggested,\r\namidst summer flowers on the water\'s edge to men and women mixed,--he\r\nwould be a courtly and efficient host; for he had the rare gift of\r\ndoing such things well.\r\n\r\nHunting was over, and the east wind was still blowing, and a great\r\nportion of the London world was out of town taking its Easter\r\nholiday, when, on an unpleasant morning, Ferdinand Lopez travelled\r\ninto the city by the Metropolitan railway from Westminster Bridge. It\r\nwas his custom to go thither when he did go,--not daily like a man of\r\nbusiness, but as chance might require, like a capitalist or a man of\r\npleasure,--in his own brougham. But on this occasion he walked down\r\nto the river side, and then walked from the Mansion House into a\r\ndingy little court called Little Tankard Yard, near the Bank of\r\nEngland, and going through a narrow dark long passage got into a\r\nlittle office at the back of a building, in which there sat at a desk\r\na greasy gentleman with a new hat on one side of his head, who might\r\nperhaps be about forty years old. The place was very dark, and the\r\nman was turning over the leaves of a ledger. A stranger to city\r\nways might probably have said that he was idle, but he was no doubt\r\nfilling his mind with that erudition which would enable him to earn\r\nhis bread. On the other side of the desk there was a little boy\r\ncopying letters. These were Mr. Sextus Parker,--commonly called Sexty\r\nParker,--and his clerk. Mr. Parker was a gentleman very well known\r\nand at the present moment favourably esteemed on the Stock Exchange.\r\n"What, Lopez!" said he. "Uncommon glad to see you. What can I do for\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Just come inside,--will you?" said Lopez. Now within Mr. Parker\'s\r\nvery small office there was a smaller office in which there were\r\na safe, a small rickety Pembroke table, two chairs, and an old\r\nwashing-stand with a tumbled towel. Lopez led the way into this\r\nsanctum as though he knew the place well, and Sexty Parker followed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Beastly day, isn\'t it?" said Sexty.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--a nasty east wind."\r\n\r\n"Cutting one in two, with a hot sun at the same time. One ought to\r\nhybernate at this time of the year."\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t you hybernate?" said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Business is too good. That\'s about it. A man has to stick to it when\r\nit does come. Everybody can\'t do like you;--give up regular work,\r\nand make a better thing of an hour now and an hour then, just as it\r\npleases you. I shouldn\'t dare go in for that kind of thing."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose you or any one else know what I go in for," said\r\nLopez, with a look that indicated offence.\r\n\r\n"Nor don\'t care," said Sexty;--"only hope it\'s something good for\r\nyour sake." Sexty Parker had known Mr. Lopez well, now for some\r\nyears, and being an overbearing man himself,--somewhat even of a\r\nbully if the truth be spoken,--and by no means apt to give way unless\r\nhard pressed, had often tried his "hand" on his friend, as he himself\r\nwould have said. But I doubt whether he could remember any instance\r\nin which he could congratulate himself on success. He was trying his\r\nhand again now, but did it with a faltering voice, having caught a\r\nglance of his friend\'s eye.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not," said Lopez. Then he continued without changing his\r\nvoice or the nature of the glance of his eye, "I\'ll tell you what I\r\nwant you to do now. I want your name to this bill for three months."\r\n\r\nSexty Parker opened his mouth and his eyes, and took the bit of paper\r\nthat was tendered to him. It was a promissory note for L750, which,\r\nif signed by him, would at the end of the specified period make him\r\nliable for that sum were it not otherwise paid. His friend Mr. Lopez\r\nwas indeed applying to him for the assistance of his name in raising\r\na loan to the amount of the sum named. This was a kind of favour\r\nwhich a man should ask almost on his knees,--and which, if so asked,\r\nMr. Sextus Parker would certainly refuse. And here was Ferdinand\r\nLopez asking it,--whom Sextus Parker had latterly regarded as an\r\nopulent man,--and asking it not at all on his knees, but, as one\r\nmight say, at the muzzle of a pistol. "Accommodation bill!" said\r\nSexty. "Why, you ain\'t hard up; are you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going just at present to tell you much about my affairs, and\r\nyet I expect you to do what I ask you. I don\'t suppose you doubt my\r\nability to raise L750."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no," said Sexty, who had been looked at and who had not\r\nborne the inspection well.\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t suppose you would refuse me even if I were hard up, as\r\nyou call it." There had been affairs before between the two men in\r\nwhich Lopez had probably been the stronger, and the memory of them,\r\nadded to the inspection which was still going on, was heavy upon poor\r\nSexty.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no;--I wasn\'t thinking of refusing. I suppose a fellow may\r\nbe a little surprised at such a thing."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you need be surprised, as such things are very\r\ncommon. I happen to have taken a share in a loan a little beyond my\r\nimmediate means, and therefore want a few hundreds. There is no one I\r\ncan ask with a better grace than you. If you ain\'t--afraid about it,\r\njust sign it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I ain\'t afraid," said Sexty, taking his pen and writing his name\r\nacross the bill. But even before the signature was finished, when\r\nhis eye was taken away from the face of his companion and fixed upon\r\nthe disagreeable piece of paper beneath his hand, he repented of\r\nwhat he was doing. He almost arrested his signature half-way. He did\r\nhesitate, but had not pluck enough to stop his hand. "It does seem to\r\nbe a d----d odd transaction all the same," he said as he leaned back\r\nin his chair.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the commonest thing in the world," said Lopez picking up\r\nthe bill in a leisurely way, folding it and putting it into his\r\npocket-book. "Have our names never been together on a bit of paper\r\nbefore?"\r\n\r\n"When we both had something to make by it."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve nothing to make and nothing to lose by this. Good day and\r\nmany thanks;--though I don\'t think so much of the affair as you seem\r\nto do." Then Ferdinand Lopez took his departure and Sexty Parker was\r\nleft alone in his bewilderment.\r\n\r\n"By George,--that\'s queer," he said to himself. "Who\'d have thought\r\nof Lopez being hard up for a few hundred pounds? But it must be all\r\nright. He wouldn\'t have come in that fashion, if it hadn\'t been all\r\nright. I oughtn\'t to have done it though! A man ought never to do\r\nthat kind of thing;--never,--never!" And Mr. Sextus Parker was much\r\ndiscontented with himself, so that when he got home that evening to\r\nthe wife of his bosom and his little family at Ponders End, he by\r\nno means made himself agreeable to them. For that sum of L750 sat\r\nupon his bosom as he ate his supper, and lay upon his chest as he\r\nslept,--like a nightmare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEverett Wharton\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that same day Lopez dined with his friend Everett Wharton at a\r\nnew club called the Progress, of which they were both members. The\r\nProgress was certainly a new club, having as yet been open hardly\r\nmore than three years; but still it was old enough to have seen many\r\nof the hopes of its early youth become dim with age and inaction.\r\nFor the Progress had intended to do great things for the Liberal\r\nparty,--or rather for political liberality in general,--and had in\r\ntruth done little or nothing. It had been got up with considerable\r\nenthusiasm, and for a while certain fiery politicians had believed\r\nthat through the instrumentality of this institution men of genius,\r\nand spirit, and natural power, but without wealth,--meaning always\r\nthemselves,--would be supplied with sure seats in Parliament and\r\na probable share in the Government. But no such results had been\r\nachieved. There had been a want of something,--some deficiency felt\r\nbut not yet defined,--which had hitherto been fatal. The young men\r\nsaid it was because no old stager who knew the way of pulling the\r\nwires would come forward and put the club in the proper groove. The\r\nold men said it was because the young men were pretentious puppies.\r\nIt was, however, not to be doubted that the party of Progress had\r\nbecome slack, and that the Liberal politicians of the country,\r\nalthough a special new club had been opened for the furtherance\r\nof their views, were not at present making much way. "What we\r\nwant is organization," said one of the leading young men. But the\r\norganization was not as yet forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe club, nevertheless, went on its way, like other clubs, and men\r\ndined and smoked and played billiards and pretended to read. Some few\r\nenergetic members still hoped that a good day would come in which\r\ntheir grand ideas might be realised,--but as regarded the members\r\ngenerally, they were content to eat and drink and play billiards. It\r\nwas a fairly good club,--with a sprinkling of Liberal lordlings, a\r\ncouple of dozen of members of Parliament who had been made to believe\r\nthat they would neglect their party duties unless they paid their\r\nmoney, and the usual assortment of barristers, attorneys, city\r\nmerchants and idle men. It was good enough at any rate for Ferdinand\r\nLopez, who was particular about his dinner, and had an opinion of his\r\nown about wines. He had been heard to assert that, for real quiet\r\ncomfort, there was not a club in London equal to it; but his hearers\r\nwere not aware that in past days he had been blackballed at the\r\nT---- and the G----. These were accidents which Lopez had a gift of\r\nkeeping in the background. His present companion, Everett Wharton,\r\nhad, as well as himself, been an original member;--and Wharton had\r\nbeen one of those who had hoped to find in the club a stepping-stone\r\nto high political life, and who now talked often with idle energy of\r\nthe need of organization.\r\n\r\n"For myself," said Lopez, "I can conceive no vainer object of\r\nambition than a seat in the British Parliament. What does any man\r\ngain by it? The few who are successful work very hard for little\r\npay and no thanks,--or nearly equally hard for no pay and as little\r\nthanks. The many who fail sit idly for hours, undergoing the weary\r\ntask of listening to platitudes, and enjoy in return the now\r\nabsolutely valueless privilege of having M.P. written on their\r\nletters."\r\n\r\n"Somebody must make laws for the country."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see the necessity. I think the country would do uncommonly\r\nwell if it were to know that no old law would be altered or new law\r\nmade for the next twenty years."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t have repealed the corn laws?"\r\n\r\n"There are no corn laws to repeal now."\r\n\r\n"Nor modify the income tax?"\r\n\r\n"I would modify nothing. But at any rate, whether laws are to be\r\naltered or to be left, it is a comfort to me that I need not put my\r\nfinger into that pie. There is one benefit indeed in being in the\r\nHouse."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t be arrested."\r\n\r\n"Well;--that, as far as it goes; and one other. It assists a man in\r\ngetting a seat as the director of certain Companies. People are still\r\nsuch asses that they trust a Board of Directors made up of members\r\nof Parliament, and therefore of course members are made welcome. But\r\nif you want to get into the House why don\'t you arrange it with your\r\nfather, instead of waiting for what the club may do for you?"\r\n\r\n"My father wouldn\'t pay a shilling for such a purpose. He was never\r\nin the House himself."\r\n\r\n"And therefore despises it."\r\n\r\n"A little of that, perhaps. No man ever worked harder than he did,\r\nor, in his way, more successfully; and having seen one after another\r\nof his juniors become members of Parliament, while he stuck to the\r\nattorneys, there is perhaps a little jealousy about it."\r\n\r\n"From what I see of the way you live at home, I should think your\r\nfather would do anything for you,--with proper management. There is\r\nno doubt, I suppose, that he could afford it?"\r\n\r\n"My father never in his life said anything to me about his own money\r\naffairs, though he says a great deal about mine. No man ever was\r\ncloser than my father. But I believe that he could afford almost\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"I wish I had such a father," said Ferdinand Lopez. "I think that I\r\nshould succeed in ascertaining the extent of his capabilities, and in\r\nmaking some use of them too."\r\n\r\nWharton nearly asked his friend,--almost summoned courage to ask\r\nhim,--whether his father had done much for him. They were very\r\nintimate; and on one subject, in which Lopez was much interested,\r\ntheir confidence had been very close. But the younger and the weaker\r\nman of the two could not quite bring himself to the point of making\r\nan inquiry which he thought would be disagreeable. Lopez had never\r\nbefore, in all their intercourse, hinted at the possibility of his\r\nhaving or having had filial aspirations. He had been as though he\r\nhad been created self-sufficient, independent of mother\'s milk\r\nor father\'s money. Now the question might have been asked almost\r\nnaturally. But it was not asked.\r\n\r\nEverett Wharton was a trouble to his father,--but not an agonizing\r\ntrouble, as are some sons. His faults were not of a nature to rob his\r\nfather\'s cup of all its sweetness and to bring his grey hairs with\r\nsorrow to the grave. Old Wharton had never had to ask himself whether\r\nhe should now, at length, let his son fall into the lowest abysses,\r\nor whether he should yet again struggle to put him on his legs,\r\nagain forgive him, again pay his debts, again endeavour to forget\r\ndishonour, and place it all to the score of thoughtless youth. Had it\r\nbeen so, I think that, if not on the first or second fall, certainly\r\non the third, the young man would have gone into the abyss; for Mr.\r\nWharton was a stern man, and capable of coming to a clear conclusion\r\non things that were nearest and even dearest to himself. But Everett\r\nWharton had simply shown himself to be inefficient to earn his own\r\nbread. He had never declined even to do this,--but had simply been\r\ninefficient. He had not declared either by words or actions that\r\nas his father was a rich man, and as he was an only son, he would\r\ntherefore do nothing. But he had tried his hand thrice, and in\r\neach case, after but short trial, had assured his father and his\r\nfriends that the thing had not suited him. Leaving Oxford without a\r\ndegree,--for the reading of the schools did not suit him,--he had\r\ngone into a banking-house, by no means as a mere clerk, but with\r\nan expressed proposition from his father, backed by the assent of\r\na partner, that he should work his way up to wealth and a great\r\ncommercial position. But six months taught him that banking was "an\r\nabomination," and he at once went into a course of reading with a\r\nbarrister. He remained at this till he was called,--for a man may be\r\ncalled with very little continuous work. But after he was called the\r\nsolitude of his chambers was too much for him, and at twenty-five\r\nhe found that the Stock Exchange was the mart in the world for such\r\ntalents and energies as he possessed. What was the nature of his\r\nfailure during the year that he went into the city, was known only to\r\nhimself and his father,--unless Ferdinand Lopez knew something of it\r\nalso. But at six-and-twenty the Stock Exchange was also abandoned;\r\nand now, at eight-and-twenty, Everett Wharton had discovered that a\r\nparliamentary career was that for which nature and his special genius\r\nhad intended him. He had probably suggested this to his father, and\r\nhad met with some cold rebuff.\r\n\r\nEverett Wharton was a good-looking, manly fellow, six feet high, with\r\nbroad shoulders, with light hair, wearing a large silky bushy beard,\r\nwhich made him look older than his years, who neither by his speech\r\nnor by his appearance would ever be taken for a fool, but who showed\r\nby the very actions of his body as well as by the play of his face,\r\nthat he lacked firmness of purpose. He certainly was no fool. He had\r\nread much, and, though he generally forgot what he read, there were\r\nleft with him from his readings certain nebulous lights, begotten by\r\nother men\'s thinking, which enabled him to talk on most subjects. It\r\ncannot be said of him that he did much thinking for himself;--but\r\nhe thought that he thought. He believed of himself that he had gone\r\nrather deep into politics, and that he was entitled to call many\r\nstatesmen asses because they did not see the things which he saw.\r\nHe had the great question of labour, and all that refers to unions,\r\nstrikes, and lock-outs, quite at his fingers\' ends. He knew how the\r\nChurch of England should be disestablished and recomposed. He was\r\nquite clear on questions of finance, and saw to a "t" how progress\r\nshould be made towards communism, so that no violence should disturb\r\nthat progress, and that in the due course of centuries all desire\r\nfor personal property should be conquered and annihilated by a\r\nphilanthropy so general as hardly to be accounted a virtue. In the\r\nmeantime he could never contrive to pay his tailor\'s bill regularly\r\nout of the allowance of L400 a year which his father made him, and\r\nwas always dreaming of the comforts of a handsome income.\r\n\r\nHe was a popular man certainly,--very popular with women, to whom\r\nhe was always courteous, and generally liked by men, to whom he was\r\ngenial and good-natured. Though he was not himself aware of the fact,\r\nhe was very dear to his father, who in his own silent way almost\r\nadmired and certainly liked the openness and guileless freedom of\r\na character which was very opposite to his own. The father, though\r\nhe had never said a word to flatter the son, did in truth give his\r\noffspring credit for greater talent than he possessed, and, even when\r\nappearing to scorn them, would listen to the young man\'s diatribes\r\nalmost with satisfaction. And Everett was very dear also to a sister,\r\nwho was the only other living member of this branch of the Wharton\r\nfamily. Much will be said of her in these pages, and it is hoped that\r\nthe reader may take an interest in her fate. But here, in speaking of\r\nthe brother, it may suffice to say, that the sister, who was endowed\r\nwith infinitely finer gifts than his, did give credit to the somewhat\r\npretentious claims of her less noble brother.\r\n\r\nIndeed it had been perhaps a misfortune with Everett Wharton that\r\nsome people had believed in him,--and a further misfortune that some\r\nothers had thought it worth their while to pretend to believe in him.\r\nAmong the latter might probably be reckoned the friend with whom he\r\nwas now dining at the Progress. A man may flatter another, as Lopez\r\noccasionally did flatter Wharton, without preconcerted falsehood. It\r\nsuits one man to be well with another, and the one learns gradually\r\nand perhaps unconsciously the way to take advantage of the foibles\r\nof the other. Now it was most material to Lopez that he should stand\r\nwell with all the members of the Wharton family, as he aspired to\r\nthe hand of the daughter of the house. Of her regard he had already\r\nthought himself nearly sure. Of the father\'s sanction to such a\r\nmarriage he had reason to be almost more than doubtful. But the\r\nbrother was his friend,--and in such circumstances a man is almost\r\njustified in flattering a brother.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what it is, Lopez," said Wharton, as they strolled out\r\nof the club together, a little after ten o\'clock, "the men of the\r\npresent day won\'t give themselves the trouble to occupy their minds\r\nwith matters which have, or should have, real interest. Pope knew all\r\nabout it when he said that \'The proper study of mankind is man.\' But\r\npeople don\'t read Pope now, or if they do they don\'t take the trouble\r\nto understand him."\r\n\r\n"Men are too busy making money, my dear fellow."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. Money\'s a very nice thing."\r\n\r\n"Very nice," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"But the search after it is debasing. If a man could make money for\r\nfour, or six, or even eight hours a day, and then wash his mind of\r\nthe pursuit, as a clerk in an office washes the copies and ledgers\r\nout of his mind, then--"\r\n\r\n"He would never make money in that way,--and keep it."\r\n\r\n"And therefore the whole thing is debasing. A man ceases to care\r\nfor the great interests of the world, or even to be aware of their\r\nexistence, when his whole soul is in Spanish bonds. They wanted to\r\nmake a banker of me, but I found that it would kill me."\r\n\r\n"It would kill me, I think, if I had to confine myself to Spanish\r\nbonds."\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean. You at any rate can understand me, though I\r\nfear you are too far gone to abandon the idea of making a fortune."\r\n\r\n"I would abandon it to-morrow if I could come into a fortune ready\r\nmade. A man must at any rate eat."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he must eat. But I am not quite sure," said Wharton\r\nthoughtfully, "that he need think about what he eats."\r\n\r\n"Unless the beef is sent up without horse radish!" It had happened\r\nthat when the two men sat down to their dinner the insufficient\r\nquantity of that vegetable supplied by the steward of the club had\r\nbeen all consumed, and Wharton had complained of the grievance.\r\n\r\n"A man has a right to that for which he has paid," said Wharton, with\r\nmock solemnity, "and if he passes over laches of that nature without\r\nobservation he does an injury to humanity at large. I\'m not going to\r\nbe caught in a trap, you know, because I like horse radish with my\r\nbeef. Well, I can\'t go farther out of my way, as I have a deal of\r\nreading to do before I court my Morpheus. If you\'ll take my advice\r\nyou\'ll go straight to the governor. Whatever Emily may feel I don\'t\r\nthink she\'ll say much to encourage you unless you go about it after\r\nthat fashion. She has prim notions of her own, which perhaps are not\r\nafter all so much amiss when a man wants to marry a girl."\r\n\r\n"God forbid that I should think that anything about your sister was\r\namiss!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there is much myself. Women are generally\r\nsuperficial,--but some are honestly superficial and some dishonestly.\r\nEmily at any rate is honest."\r\n\r\n"Stop half a moment." Then they sauntered arm in arm down the broad\r\npavement leading from Pall Mall to the Duke of York\'s column. "I wish\r\nI could make out your father more clearly. He is always civil to me,\r\nbut he has a cold way of looking at me which makes me think I am not\r\nin his good books."\r\n\r\n"He is like that to everybody."\r\n\r\n"I never seem to get beyond the skin with him. You must have heard\r\nhim speak of me in my absence?"\r\n\r\n"He never says very much about anybody."\r\n\r\n"But a word would let me know how the land lies. You know me well\r\nenough to be aware that I am the last man to be curious as to what\r\nothers think of me. Indeed I do not care about it as much as a man\r\nshould do. I am utterly indifferent to the opinion of the world at\r\nlarge, and would never object to the company of a pleasant person\r\nbecause the pleasant person abused me behind my back. What I value\r\nis the pleasantness of the man and not his liking or disliking for\r\nmyself. But here the dearest aim of my life is concerned, and I might\r\nbe guided either this way or that, to my great advantage, by knowing\r\nwhether I stand well or ill with him."\r\n\r\n"You have dined three times within the last three months in\r\nManchester Square, and I don\'t know any other man,--certainly no\r\nother young man,--who has had such strong proof of intimacy from my\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I know my advantages. But I have been there as your friend,\r\nnot as his."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t care twopence about my friends. I wanted to give Charlie\r\nSkate a dinner, but my father wouldn\'t have him at any price."\r\n\r\n"Charlie Skate is out at elbows, and bets at billiards. I am\r\nrespectable,--or at any rate your father thinks so. Your father is\r\nmore anxious about you than you are aware of, and wishes to make his\r\nhouse pleasant to you as long as he can do so to your advantage. As\r\nfar as you are concerned he rather approves of me, fancying that\r\nmy turn for making money is stronger than my turn for spending it.\r\nNevertheless, he looks upon me as a friend of yours rather than his\r\nown. Though he has given me three dinners in three months,--and I own\r\nthe greatness of his hospitality,--I don\'t suppose he ever said a\r\nword in my favour. I wish I knew what he does say."\r\n\r\n"He says he knows nothing about you."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--that\'s it, is it? Then he can know no harm. When next he says\r\nso ask him of how many of the men who dine at his house he can say as\r\nmuch. Good night;--I won\'t keep you any longer. But I can tell you\r\nthis;--if between us we can manage to handle him rightly, you may get\r\nyour seat in Parliament and I may get my wife;--that is, of course,\r\nif she will have me."\r\n\r\nThen they parted, but Lopez remained in the pathway, walking up\r\nand down by the side of the old military club, thinking of things.\r\nHe certainly knew his friend, the younger Wharton, intimately,\r\nappreciating the man\'s good qualities, and being fully aware of\r\nthe man\'s weakness. By his questions he had extracted quite enough\r\nto assure himself that Emily\'s father would be adverse to his\r\nproposition. He had not felt much doubt before, but now he was\r\ncertain. "He doesn\'t know much about me," he said, musing to himself.\r\n"Well, no; he doesn\'t;--and there isn\'t very much that I can tell\r\nhim. Of course he\'s wise,--as wisdom goes. But then, wise men do do\r\nfoolish things at intervals. The discreetest of city bankers are\r\ntalked out of their money; the most scrupulous of matrons are talked\r\nout of their virtue; the most experienced of statesmen are talked out\r\nof their principles. And who can really calculate chances? Men who\r\nlead forlorn hopes generally push through without being wounded;--and\r\nthe fifth or sixth heir comes to a title." So much he said, palpably,\r\nthough to himself, with his inner voice. Then,--impalpably, with no\r\neven inner voice,--he asked himself what chance he might have of\r\nprevailing with the girl herself; and he almost ventured to tell\r\nhimself that in that direction he need not despair.\r\n\r\nIn very truth he loved the girl and reverenced her, believing her to\r\nbe better and higher and nobler than other human beings,--as a man\r\ndoes when he is in love; and so believing, he had those doubts as to\r\nhis own success which such reverence produces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMr. Abel Wharton, Q.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nLopez was not a man to let grass grow under his feet when he had\r\nanything to do. When he was tired of walking backwards and forwards\r\nover the same bit of pavement, subject all the while to a cold east\r\nwind, he went home and thought of the same matter while he lay in\r\nbed. Even were he to get the girl\'s assurances of love, without the\r\nfather\'s consent he might find himself farther from his object than\r\never. Mr. Wharton was a man of old fashions, who would think himself\r\nill-used and his daughter ill-used, and who would think also that\r\na general offence would have been committed against good social\r\nmanners, if his daughter were to be asked for her hand without his\r\nprevious consent. Should he absolutely refuse,--why then the battle,\r\nthough it would be a desperate battle, might perhaps be fought with\r\nother strategy; but, giving to the matter his best consideration,\r\nLopez thought it expedient to go at once to the father. In doing this\r\nhe would have no silly tremors. Whatever he might feel in speaking\r\nto the girl, he had sufficient self-confidence to be able to ask the\r\nfather, if not with assurance, at any rate without trepidation. It\r\nwas, he thought, probable that the father, at the first attack, would\r\nneither altogether accede, or altogether refuse. The disposition of\r\nthe man was averse to the probability of an absolute reply at the\r\nfirst moment. The lover imagined that it might be possible for him to\r\ntake advantage of the period of doubt which would thus be created.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton was and had for a great many years been a barrister\r\npractising in the Equity Courts,--or rather in one Equity Court, for\r\nthroughout a life\'s work now extending to nearly fifty years, he had\r\nhardly ever gone out of the single Vice-Chancellor\'s Court which was\r\nmuch better known by Mr. Wharton\'s name than by that of the less\r\neminent judge who now sat there. His had been a very peculiar, a very\r\ntoilsome, but yet probably a very satisfactory life. He had begun his\r\npractice early, and had worked in a stuff gown till he was nearly\r\nsixty. At that time he had amassed a large fortune, mainly from his\r\nprofession, but partly also by the careful use of his own small\r\npatrimony and by his wife\'s money. Men knew that he was rich, but\r\nno one knew the extent of his wealth. When he submitted to take a\r\nsilk gown, he declared among his friends that he did so as a step\r\npreparatory to his retirement. The altered method of work would not\r\nsuit him at his age, nor,--as he said,--would it be profitable. He\r\nwould take his silk as an honour for his declining years, so that he\r\nmight become a bencher at his Inn. But he had now been working for\r\nthe last twelve or fourteen years with his silk gown,--almost as hard\r\nas in younger days, and with pecuniary results almost as serviceable;\r\nand though from month to month he declared his intention of taking\r\nno fresh briefs, and though he did now occasionally refuse work,\r\nstill he was there with his mind as clear as ever, and with his body\r\napparently as little affected by fatigue.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton had not married till he was forty, and his wife had now\r\nbeen two years dead. He had had six children,--of whom but two were\r\nnow left to make a household for his old age. He had been nearly\r\nfifty when his youngest daughter was born, and was therefore now an\r\nold father of a young child. But he was one of those men who, as\r\nin youth they are never very young, so in age are they never very\r\nold. He could still ride his cob in the park jauntily; and did so\r\ncarefully every morning in his life, after an early cup of tea and\r\nbefore his breakfast. And he could walk home from his chambers every\r\nday, and on Sundays could do the round of the parks on foot. Twice a\r\nweek, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, he dined at that old law club, the\r\nEldon, and played whist after dinner till twelve o\'clock. This was\r\nthe great dissipation and, I think, the chief charm of his life. In\r\nthe middle of August he and his daughter usually went for a month\r\nto Wharton Hall in Herefordshire, the seat of his cousin Sir Alured\r\nWharton;--and this was the one duty of his life which was a burthen\r\nto him. But he had been made to believe that it was essential to his\r\nhealth, and to his wife\'s, and then to his girl\'s health, that he\r\nshould every summer leave town for a time,--and where else was he to\r\ngo? Sir Alured was a relation and a gentleman. Emily liked Wharton\r\nHall. It was the proper thing. He hated Wharton Hall, but then he did\r\nnot know any place out of London that he would not hate worse. He\r\nhad once been induced to go up the Rhine, but had never repeated the\r\nexperiment of foreign travel. Emily sometimes went abroad with her\r\ncousins, during which periods it was supposed that the old lawyer\r\nspent a good deal of his time at the Eldon. He was a spare, thin,\r\nstrongly made man, with spare light brown hair, hardly yet grizzled,\r\nwith small grey whiskers, clear eyes, bushy eyebrows, with a long\r\nugly nose, on which young barristers had been heard to declare that\r\nyou might hang a small kettle, and with considerable vehemence of\r\ntalk when he was opposed in argument. For, with all his well-known\r\ncoolness of temper, Mr. Wharton could become very hot in an argument,\r\nwhen the nature of the case in hand required heat. On one subject\r\nall who knew him were agreed. He was a thorough lawyer. Many doubted\r\nhis eloquence, and some declared that he had known well the extent\r\nof his own powers in abstaining from seeking the higher honours of\r\nhis profession; but no one doubted his law. He had once written a\r\nbook,--on the mortgage of stocks in trade; but that had been in early\r\nlife, and he had never since dabbled in literature.\r\n\r\nHe was certainly a man of whom men were generally afraid. At the\r\nwhist-table no one would venture to scold him. In the court no one\r\never contradicted him. In his own house, though he was very quiet,\r\nthe servants dreaded to offend him, and were attentive to his\r\nslightest behests. When he condescended to ride with any acquaintance\r\nin the park, it was always acknowledged that old Wharton was to\r\nregulate the pace. His name was Abel, and all his life he had been\r\nknown as able Abe;--a silent, far-seeing, close-fisted, just old man,\r\nwho was not, however, by any means deficient in sympathy either with\r\nthe sufferings or with the joys of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt was Easter time and the courts were not sitting, but Mr. Wharton\r\nwas in his chamber as a matter of course at ten o\'clock. He knew no\r\nreal homely comforts elsewhere,--unless at the whist-table at the\r\nEldon. He ate and drank and slept in his own house in Manchester\r\nSquare, but he could hardly be said to live there. It was not\r\nthere that his mind was awake, and that the powers of the man were\r\nexercised. When he came up from the dining-room to join his daughter\r\nafter dinner he would get her to sing him a song, and would then seat\r\nhimself with a book. But he never read in his own house, invariably\r\nfalling into a sweet and placid slumber, from which he was never\r\ndisturbed till his daughter kissed him as she went to bed. Then\r\nhe would walk about the room, and look at his watch, and shuffle\r\nuneasily through half-an-hour till his conscience allowed him to take\r\nhimself to his chamber. He was a man of no pursuits in his own house.\r\nBut from ten in the morning till five, or often till six, in the\r\nevening, his mind was active in some work. It was not now all law,\r\nas it used to be. In the drawer of the old piece of furniture which\r\nstood just at the right hand of his own arm-chair there were various\r\nbooks hidden away, which he was sometimes ashamed to have seen by\r\nhis clients,--poetry and novels and even fairy tales. For there was\r\nnothing Mr. Wharton could not read in his chambers, though there was\r\nnothing that he could read in his own house. He had a large pleasant\r\nroom in which to sit, looking out from the ground floor of Stone\r\nBuildings on to the gardens belonging to the Inn,--and here, in the\r\ncentre of the metropolis, but in perfect quiet as far as the outside\r\nworld was concerned, he had lived and still lived his life.\r\n\r\nAt about noon on the day following that on which Lopez had made his\r\nsudden swoop on Mr. Parker and had then dined with Everett Wharton,\r\nhe called at Stone Buildings and was shown into the lawyer\'s room.\r\nHis quick eye at once discovered the book which Mr. Wharton half\r\nhid away, and saw upon it Mr. Mudie\'s suspicious ticket. Barristers\r\ncertainly never get their law books from Mudie, and Lopez at once\r\nknew that his hoped-for father-in-law had been reading a novel. He\r\nhad not suspected such weakness, but argued well from it for the\r\nbusiness he had in hand. There must be a soft spot to be found about\r\nthe heart of an old lawyer who spent his mornings in such occupation.\r\n"How do you do, sir?" said Mr. Wharton rising from his seat. "I hope\r\nI see you well, sir." Though he had been reading a novel his tone\r\nand manner were very cold. Lopez had never been in Stone Buildings\r\nbefore, and was not quite sure that he might not have committed some\r\noffence in coming there. "Take a seat, Mr. Lopez. Is there anything I\r\ncan do for you in my way?"\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal that could be done "in his way" as\r\nfather;--but how was it to be introduced and the case made clear?\r\nLopez did not know whether the old man had as yet ever suspected\r\nsuch a feeling as that which he now intended to declare. He had\r\nbeen intimate at the house in Manchester Square, and had certainly\r\ningratiated himself very closely with a certain Mrs. Roby, who had\r\nbeen Mrs. Wharton\'s sister and constant companion, who lived in\r\nBerkeley Street, close round the corner from Manchester Square, and\r\nspent very much of her time with Emily Wharton. They were together\r\ndaily, as though Mrs. Roby had assumed the part of a second mother,\r\nand Lopez was well aware that Mrs. Roby knew of his love. If there\r\nwas real confidence between Mrs. Roby and the old lawyer, the old\r\nlawyer must know it also;--but as to that Lopez felt that he was in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nThe task of speaking to an old father is not unpleasant when the\r\nlover knows that he has been smiled upon, and, in fact, approved for\r\nthe last six months. He is going to be patted on the back, and made\r\nmuch of, and received into the family. He is to be told that his\r\nMary or his Augusta has been the best daughter in the world and will\r\ntherefore certainly be the best wife, and he himself will probably on\r\nthat special occasion be spoken of with unqualified praise,--and all\r\nwill be pleasant. But the subject is one very difficult to broach\r\nwhen no previous light has been thrown on it. Ferdinand Lopez,\r\nhowever, was not the man to stand shivering on the brink when a\r\nplunge was necessary,--and therefore he made his plunge. "Mr.\r\nWharton, I have taken the liberty to call upon you here, because I\r\nwant to speak to you about your daughter."\r\n\r\n"About my daughter!" The old man\'s surprise was quite genuine. Of\r\ncourse when he had given himself a moment to think, he knew what must\r\nbe the nature of his visitor\'s communication. But up to that moment\r\nhe had never mixed his daughter and Ferdinand Lopez in his thoughts\r\ntogether. And now, the idea having come upon him, he looked at the\r\naspirant with severe and unpleasant eyes. It was manifest to the\r\naspirant that the first flash of the thing was painful to the father.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I know how great is my presumption. But, yet, having\r\nventured, I will hardly say to entertain a hope, but to have come to\r\nsuch a state that I can only be happy by hoping, I have thought it\r\nbest to come to you at once."\r\n\r\n"Does she know anything of this?"\r\n\r\n"Of my visit to you? Nothing."\r\n\r\n"Of your intentions;--of your suit generally? Am I to understand that\r\nthis has any sanction from her?"\r\n\r\n"None at all."\r\n\r\n"Have you told her anything of it?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word. I come to ask you for your permission to address her."\r\n\r\n"You mean that she has no knowledge whatever of your--your preference\r\nfor her."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say that. It is hardly possible that I should have learned\r\nto love her as I do without some consciousness on her part that it is\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"What I mean is, without any beating about the bush,--have you been\r\nmaking love to her?"\r\n\r\n"Who is to say in what making love consists, Mr. Wharton?"\r\n\r\n"D---- it, sir, a gentleman knows. A gentleman knows whether he has\r\nbeen playing on a girl\'s feelings, and a gentleman, when he is asked\r\nas I have asked you, will at any rate tell the truth. I don\'t want\r\nany definitions. Have you been making love to her?"\r\n\r\n"I think, Mr. Wharton, that I have behaved like a gentleman; and that\r\nyou will acknowledge at least so much when you come to know exactly\r\nwhat I have done and what I have not done. I have endeavoured to\r\ncommend myself to your daughter, but I have never spoken a word of\r\nlove to her."\r\n\r\n"Does Everett know of all this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And has he encouraged it?"\r\n\r\n"He knows of it, because he is my most intimate friend. Whoever the\r\nlady might have been, I should have told him. He is attached to me,\r\nand would not, I think, on his own account, object to call me his\r\nbrother. I spoke to him yesterday on the matter very plainly, and he\r\ntold me that I ought certainly to see you first. I quite agreed with\r\nhim, and therefore I am here. There has certainly been nothing in his\r\nconduct to make you angry, and I do not think that there has been\r\nanything in mine."\r\n\r\nThere was a dignity of demeanour and a quiet assured courage which\r\nhad its effect upon the old lawyer. He felt that he could not storm\r\nand talk in ambiguous language of what a "gentleman" would or\r\nwould not do. He might disapprove of this man altogether as a\r\nson-in-law,--and at the present moment he thought that he did,--but\r\nstill the man was entitled to a civil answer. How were lovers to\r\napproach the ladies of their love in any manner more respectful than\r\nthis? "Mr. Lopez," he said, "you must forgive me if I say that you\r\nare comparatively a stranger to us."\r\n\r\n"That is an accident which would be easily cured if your will in that\r\ndirection were as good as mine."\r\n\r\n"But, perhaps, it isn\'t. One has to be explicit in these matters.\r\nA daughter\'s happiness is a very serious consideration,--and some\r\npeople, among whom I confess that I am one, consider that like should\r\nmarry like. I should wish to see my daughter marry,--not only in my\r\nown sphere, neither higher nor lower,--but with some one of my own\r\nclass."\r\n\r\n"I hardly know, Mr. Wharton, whether that is intended to exclude me."\r\n\r\n"Well,--to tell you the truth I know nothing about you. I don\'t know\r\nwho your father was,--whether he was an Englishman, whether he was\r\na Christian, whether he was a Protestant,--not even whether he was\r\na gentleman. These are questions which I should not dream of asking\r\nunder any other circumstances;--would be matters with which I should\r\nhave no possible concern, if you were simply an acquaintance. But\r\nwhen you talk to a man about his daughter--!"\r\n\r\n"I acknowledge freely your right of inquiry."\r\n\r\n"And I know nothing of your means;--nothing whatever. I understand\r\nthat you live as a man of fortune, but I presume that you earn your\r\nbread. I know nothing of the way in which you earn it, nothing of the\r\ncertainty or amount of your means."\r\n\r\n"Those things are of course matters for inquiry; but may I presume\r\nthat you have no objection which satisfactory answers to such\r\nquestions may not remove?"\r\n\r\n"I shall never willingly give my daughter to any one who is not the\r\nson of an English gentleman. It may be a prejudice, but that is my\r\nfeeling."\r\n\r\n"My father was certainly not an English gentleman. He was a\r\nPortuguese." In admitting this, and in thus subjecting himself at\r\nonce to one clearly-stated ground of objection,--the objection being\r\none which, though admitted, carried with itself neither fault nor\r\ndisgrace,--Lopez felt that he had got a certain advantage. He could\r\nnot get over the fact that he was the son of a Portuguese parent, but\r\nby admitting that openly he thought he might avoid present discussion\r\non matters which might, perhaps, be more disagreeable, but to which\r\nhe need not allude if the accident of his birth were to be taken by\r\nthe father as settling the question. "My mother was an English lady,"\r\nhe added, "but my father certainly was not an Englishman. I never\r\nhad the common happiness of knowing either of them. I was an orphan\r\nbefore I understood what it was to have a parent."\r\n\r\nThis was said with a pathos which for the moment stopped the\r\nexpression of any further harsh criticism from the lawyer. Mr.\r\nWharton could not instantly repeat his objection to a parentage\r\nwhich was matter for such melancholy reflections; but he felt at the\r\nsame time that as he had luckily landed himself on a positive and\r\nundeniable ground of objection to a match which was distasteful to\r\nhim, it would be unwise for him to go to other matters in which he\r\nmight be less successful. By doing so, he would seem to abandon the\r\nground which he had already made good. He thought it probable that\r\nthe man might have an adequate income, and yet he did not wish\r\nto welcome him as a son-in-law. He thought it possible that the\r\nPortuguese father might be a Portuguese nobleman, and therefore\r\none whom he would be driven to admit to have been in some sort a\r\ngentleman;--but yet this man who was now in his presence and whom\r\nhe continued to scan with the closest observation, was not what he\r\ncalled a gentleman. The foreign blood was proved, and that would\r\nsuffice. As he looked at Lopez he thought that he detected Jewish\r\nsigns, but he was afraid to make any allusion to religion, lest Lopez\r\nshould declare that his ancestors had been noted as Christians since\r\nSt. James first preached in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\n"I was educated altogether in England," continued Lopez, "till I was\r\nsent to a German university in the idea that the languages of the\r\ncontinent are not generally well learned in this country. I can never\r\nbe sufficiently thankful to my guardian for doing so."\r\n\r\n"I dare say;--I dare say. French and German are very useful. I have a\r\nprejudice of my own in favour of Greek and Latin."\r\n\r\n"But I rather fancy I picked up more Greek and Latin at Bohn than I\r\nshould have got here, had I stuck to nothing else."\r\n\r\n"I dare say;--I dare say. You may be an Admirable Crichton for what I\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"I have not intended to make any boast, sir, but simply to vindicate\r\nthose who had the care of my education. If you have no objection\r\nexcept that founded on my birth, which is an accident--"\r\n\r\n"When one man is a peer and another a ploughman, that is an accident.\r\nOne doesn\'t find fault with the ploughman, but one doesn\'t ask him to\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\n"But my accident," said Lopez smiling, "is one which you would hardly\r\ndiscover unless you were told. Had I called myself Talbot you would\r\nnot know but that I was as good an Englishman as yourself."\r\n\r\n"A man of course may be taken in by falsehoods," said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n"If you have no other objection than that raised, I hope you will\r\nallow me to visit in Manchester Square."\r\n\r\n"There may be ten thousand other objections, Mr. Lopez, but I\r\nreally think that the one is enough. Of course I know nothing of\r\nmy daughter\'s feelings. I should imagine that the matter is as\r\nstrange to her as it is to me. But I cannot give you anything like\r\nencouragement. If I am ever to have a son-in-law I should wish to\r\nhave an English son-in-law. I do not even know what your profession\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"I am engaged in foreign loans."\r\n\r\n"Very precarious I should think. A sort of gambling; isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"It is the business by which many of the greatest mercantile houses\r\nin the city have been made."\r\n\r\n"I dare say;--I dare say;--and by which they come to ruin. I have the\r\ngreatest respect in the world for mercantile enterprise, and have\r\nhad as much to do as most men with mercantile questions. But I ain\'t\r\nsure that I wish to marry my daughter in the City. Of course it\'s all\r\nprejudice. I won\'t deny that on general subjects I can give as much\r\nlatitude as any man; but when one\'s own hearth is attacked--"\r\n\r\n"Surely such a proposition as mine, Mr. Wharton, is no attack!"\r\n\r\n"In my sense it is. When a man proposes to assault and invade the\r\nvery kernel of another man\'s heart, to share with him, and indeed to\r\ntake from him, the very dearest of his possessions, to become part\r\nand parcel with him either for infinite good or infinite evil, then a\r\nman has a right to guard even his prejudices as precious bulwarks."\r\nMr. Wharton as he said this was walking about the room with his hands\r\nin his trowsers pockets. "I have always been for absolute toleration\r\nin matters of religion,--have always advocated admission of Roman\r\nCatholics and Jews into Parliament, and even to the Bench. In\r\nordinary life I never question a man\'s religion. It is nothing to me\r\nwhether he believes in Mahomet, or has no belief at all. But when a\r\nman comes to me for my daughter--"\r\n\r\n"I have always belonged to the Church of England," said Ferdinand\r\nLopez.\r\n\r\n"Lopez is at any rate a bad name to go to a Protestant church with,\r\nand I don\'t want my daughter to bear it. I am very frank with you,\r\nas in such a matter men ought to understand each other. Personally\r\nI have liked you well enough and have been glad to see you at my\r\nhouse. Everett and you have seemed to be friends, and I have had no\r\nobjection to make. But marrying into a family is a very serious thing\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"No man feels that more strongly than I do, Mr. Wharton."\r\n\r\n"There had better be an end of it."\r\n\r\n"Even though I should be happy enough to obtain her favour?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t think that she cares about you. I don\'t think it for a\r\nmoment. You say you haven\'t spoken to her, and I am sure she\'s not\r\na girl to throw herself at a man\'s head. I don\'t approve it, and I\r\nthink it had better fall to the ground. It must fall to the ground."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would give me a reason."\r\n\r\n"Because you are not English."\r\n\r\n"But I am English. My father was a foreigner."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t suit my ideas. I suppose I may have my own ideas about my\r\nown family, Mr. Lopez? I feel perfectly certain that my child will do\r\nnothing to displease me, and this would displease me. If we were to\r\ntalk for an hour I could say nothing further."\r\n\r\n"I hope that I may be able to present things to you in an aspect so\r\naltered," said Lopez as he prepared to take his leave, "as to make\r\nyou change your mind."\r\n\r\n"Possibly;--possibly," said Wharton, "but I do not think it probable.\r\nGood morning to you, sir. If I have said anything that has seemed\r\nto be unkind, put it down to my anxiety as a father and not to my\r\nconduct as a man." Then the door was closed behind his visitor, and\r\nMr. Wharton was left walking up and down his room alone. He was by\r\nno means satisfied with himself. He felt that he had been rude and\r\nat the same time not decisive. He had not explained to the man as\r\nhe would wish to have done, that it was monstrous and out of the\r\nquestion that a daughter of the Whartons, one of the oldest families\r\nin England, should be given to a friendless Portuguese,--a probable\r\nJew,--about whom nobody knew anything. Then he remembered that sooner\r\nor later his girl would have at least L60,000, a fact of which no\r\nhuman being but himself was aware. Would it not be well that somebody\r\nshould be made aware of it, so that his girl might have the chance\r\nof suitors preferable to this swarthy son of Judah? He began to be\r\nafraid, as he thought of it, that he was not managing his matters\r\nwell. How would it be with him if he should find that the girl was\r\nreally in love with this swarthy son of Judah? He had never inquired\r\nabout his girl\'s heart, though there was one to whom he hoped that\r\nhis girl\'s heart might some day be given. He almost made up his mind\r\nto go home at once, so anxious was he. But the prospect of having to\r\nspend an entire afternoon in Manchester Square was too much for him,\r\nand he remained in his chamber till the usual hour.\r\n\r\nLopez, as he returned from Lincoln\'s Inn, westward to his club,\r\nwas, on the whole, contented with the interview. He had expected\r\nopposition. He had not thought that the cherry would fall easily into\r\nhis mouth. But the conversation generally had not taken those turns\r\nwhich he had thought would be most detrimental to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMrs. Roby\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton, as he walked home, remembered that Mrs. Roby was to dine\r\nat his house on that evening. During the remainder of the day, after\r\nthe departure of Lopez, he had been unable to take his mind from the\r\nconsideration of the proposition made to him. He had tried the novel,\r\nand he had tried Huggins _v._ the Trustees of the Charity of St.\r\nAmbox, a case of undeniable importance in which he was engaged on the\r\npart of Huggins, but neither was sufficiently powerful to divert his\r\nthoughts. Throughout the morning he was imagining what he would say\r\nto Emily about this lover of hers,--in what way he would commence\r\nthe conversation, and how he would express his own opinion should\r\nhe find that she was in any degree favourable to the man. Should\r\nshe altogether ignore the man\'s pretensions, there would be no\r\ndifficulty. But if she hesitated,--if, as was certainly possible, she\r\nshould show any partiality for the man, then there would be a knot\r\nwhich would require untying. Hitherto the intercourse between the\r\nfather and daughter had been simple and pleasant. He had given her\r\neverything she asked for, and she had obeyed him in all the very\r\nfew matters as to which he had demanded obedience. Questions of\r\ndiscipline, as far as there had been any discipline, had generally\r\nbeen left to Mrs. Roby. Mrs. Roby was to dine in Manchester Square\r\nto-day, and perhaps it would be well that he should have a few words\r\nwith Mrs. Roby before he spoke to his daughter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Roby had a husband, but Mr. Roby had not been asked to dine\r\nin the Square on this occasion. Mrs. Roby dined in the Square very\r\noften, but Mr. Roby very seldom,--not probably above once a year, on\r\nsome special occasion. He and Mr. Wharton had married sisters, but\r\nthey were quite unlike in character and had never become friends.\r\nMrs. Wharton had been nearly twenty years younger than her husband;\r\nMrs. Roby had been six or seven years younger than her sister;\r\nand Mr. Roby was a year or two younger than his wife. The two men\r\ntherefore belonged to different periods of life, Mr. Roby at the\r\npresent time being a florid youth of forty. He had a moderate\r\nfortune, inherited from his mother, of which he was sufficiently\r\ncareful; but he loved races, and read sporting papers; he was\r\naddicted to hunting and billiards; he shot pigeons, and,--so Mr.\r\nWharton had declared calumniously more than once to an intimate\r\nfriend,--had not an H in his vocabulary. The poor man did drop an\r\naspirate now and again; but he knew his defect and strove hard, and\r\nwith fair average success, to overcome it. But Mr. Wharton did not\r\nlove him, and they were not friends. Perhaps neither did Mrs. Roby\r\nlove him very ardently. She was at any rate almost always willing to\r\nleave her own house to come to the Square, and on such occasions Mr.\r\nRoby was always willing to dine at the Nimrod, the club which it\r\ndelighted him to frequent.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton, on entering his own house, met his son on the staircase.\r\n"Do you dine at home to-day, Everett?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir; no, sir. I don\'t think I do. I think I half promised to\r\ndine with a fellow at the club."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think you\'d make things meet more easily about the end of\r\nthe year if you dined oftener here, where you have nothing to pay,\r\nand less frequently at the club, where you pay for everything?"\r\n\r\n"But what I should save you would lose, sir. That\'s the way I look at\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Then I advise you to look at it the other way, and leave me to\r\ntake care of myself. Come in here, I want to speak to you." Everett\r\nfollowed his father into a dingy back parlour, which was fitted up\r\nwith book shelves and was generally called the study, but which was\r\ngloomy and comfortless because it was seldom used. "I have had your\r\nfriend Lopez with me at my chambers to-day. I don\'t like your friend\r\nLopez."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for that, sir."\r\n\r\n"He is a man as to whom I should wish to have a good deal of evidence\r\nbefore I would trust him to be what he seems to be. I dare say he\'s\r\nclever."\r\n\r\n"I think he\'s more than clever."\r\n\r\n"I dare say;--and well instructed in some respects."\r\n\r\n"I believe him to be a thorough linguist, sir."\r\n\r\n"I dare say. I remember a waiter at an hotel in Holborn who could\r\nspeak seven languages. It\'s an accomplishment very necessary for a\r\nCourier or a Queen\'s Messenger."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say, sir, that you disregard foreign languages?"\r\n\r\n"I have said nothing of the kind. But in my estimation they don\'t\r\nstand in the place of principles, or a profession, or birth, or\r\ncountry. I fancy there has been some conversation between you about\r\nyour sister."\r\n\r\n"Certainly there has."\r\n\r\n"A young man should be very chary how he speaks to another man, to a\r\nstranger, about his sister. A sister\'s name should be too sacred for\r\nclub talk."\r\n\r\n"Club talk! Good heavens, sir; you don\'t think that I have spoken of\r\nEmily in that way? There isn\'t a man in London has a higher respect\r\nfor his sister than I have for mine. This man, by no means in a light\r\nway but with all seriousness, has told me that he was attached to\r\nEmily; and I, believing him to be a gentleman and well to do in the\r\nworld, have referred him to you. Can that have been wrong?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how he\'s \'to do\', as you call it. I haven\'t asked, and\r\nI don\'t mean to ask. But I doubt his being a gentleman. He is not an\r\nEnglish gentleman. What was his father?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the least idea."\r\n\r\n"Or his mother?"\r\n\r\n"He has never mentioned her to me."\r\n\r\n"Nor his family; nor anything of their antecedents? He is a man\r\nfallen out of the moon. All that is nothing to us as passing\r\nacquaintances. Between men such ignorance should I think bar absolute\r\nintimacy;--but that may be a matter of taste. But it should be held\r\nto be utterly antagonistic to any such alliance as that of marriage.\r\nHe seems to be a friend of yours. You had better make him understand\r\nthat it is quite out of the question. I have told him so, and you had\r\nbetter repeat it." So saying, Mr. Wharton went upstairs to dress, and\r\nEverett, having received his father\'s instructions, went away to the\r\nclub.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wharton reached the drawing-room, he found Mrs. Roby alone,\r\nand he at once resolved to discuss the matter with her before he\r\nspoke to his daughter. "Harriet," he said abruptly, "do you know\r\nanything of one Mr. Lopez?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lopez! Oh yes, I know him."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that he is an intimate friend?"\r\n\r\n"As friends go in London, he is. He comes to our house, and I think\r\nthat he hunts with Dick." Dick was Mr. Roby.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a recommendation."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Wharton, I hardly know what you mean by that," said Mrs.\r\nRoby, smiling. "I don\'t think, my husband will do Mr. Lopez any harm;\r\nand I am sure Mr. Lopez won\'t do my husband any."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not. But that\'s not the question. Roby can take care of\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"Quite so."\r\n\r\n"And so I dare say can Mr. Lopez." At this moment Emily entered the\r\nroom. "My dear," said her father, "I am speaking to your aunt. Would\r\nyou mind going downstairs and waiting for us? Tell them we shall be\r\nready for dinner in ten minutes." Then Emily passed out of the room,\r\nand Mrs. Roby assumed a grave demeanour. "The man we are speaking\r\nof has been to me and has made an offer for Emily." As he said this\r\nhe looked anxiously into his sister-in-law\'s face, in order that\r\nhe might tell from that how far she favoured the idea of such a\r\nmarriage,--and he thought that he perceived at once that she was\r\nnot averse to it. "You know it is quite out of the question," he\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why it should be out of the question. But of course\r\nyour opinion would have great weight with Emily."\r\n\r\n"Great weight! Well;--I should hope so. If not, I do not know\r\nwhose opinion is to have weight. In the first place the man is a\r\nforeigner."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no;--he is English. But if he were a foreigner: many English\r\ngirls marry foreigners."\r\n\r\n"My daughter shall not;--not with my permission. You have not\r\nencouraged him, I hope."\r\n\r\n"I have not interfered at all," said Mrs. Roby. But this was a lie.\r\nMrs. Roby had interfered. Mrs. Roby, in discussing the merits and\r\ncharacter of the lover with the young lady, had always lent herself\r\nto the lover\'s aid,--and had condescended to accept from the lover\r\nvarious presents which she could hardly have taken had she been\r\nhostile to him.\r\n\r\n"And now tell me about herself. Has she seen him often?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. Wharton, he has dined here, in the house, over and over\r\nagain. I thought that you were encouraging him."\r\n\r\n"Heavens and earth!"\r\n\r\n"Of course she has seen him. When a man dines at a house he is bound\r\nto call. Of course he has called,--I don\'t know how often. And she\r\nhas met him round the corner."--"Round the corner," in Manchester\r\nSquare, meant Mrs. Roby\'s house in Berkeley Street.--"Last Sunday\r\nthey were at the Zoo together. Dick got them tickets. I thought you\r\nknew all about it."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that my daughter went to the Zoological Gardens alone\r\nwith this man?" the father asked in dismay.\r\n\r\n"Dick was with them. I should have gone, only I had a headache. Did\r\nyou not know she went?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I heard about the Gardens. But I heard nothing of the man."\r\n\r\n"I thought, Mr. Wharton, you were all in his favour."\r\n\r\n"I am not at all in his favour. I dislike him particularly. For\r\nanything I know he may have sold pencils about the streets like any\r\nother Jew-boy."\r\n\r\n"He goes to church just as you do,--that is, if he goes anywhere;\r\nwhich I dare say he does about as often as yourself, Mr. Wharton."\r\nNow Mr. Wharton, though he was a thorough and perhaps a bigoted\r\nmember of the Church of England, was not fond of going to church.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me," he said, pressing his hands together, and\r\nlooking very seriously into his sister-in-law\'s face; "do you mean to\r\ntell me that she--likes him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I think she does like him."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say--she\'s in love with him?"\r\n\r\n"She has never told me that she is. Young ladies are shy of making\r\nsuch assertions as to their own feelings before the due time for\r\ndoing so has come. I think she prefers him to anybody else; and that\r\nwere he to propose to herself, she would give him her consent to go\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"He shall never enter this house again," said Mr. Wharton\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\n"You must arrange that with her. If you have so strong an objection\r\nto him, I wonder that you should have had him here at all."\r\n\r\n"How was I to know? God bless my soul!--just because a man was\r\nallowed to dine here once or twice! Upon my word, it\'s too bad!"\r\n\r\n"Papa, won\'t you and aunt come down to dinner?" said Emily, opening\r\nthe door gently. Then they went down to dinner, and during the meal\r\nnothing was said about Mr. Lopez. But they were not very merry\r\ntogether, and poor Emily felt sure that her own affairs had been\r\ndiscussed in a troublesome manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n"No One Knows Anything About Him"\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither at dinner, on that evening at Manchester Square, nor after\r\ndinner, as long as Mrs. Roby remained in the house, was a word said\r\nabout Lopez by Mr. Wharton. He remained longer than usual with his\r\nbottle of port wine in the dining-room; and when he went upstairs,\r\nhe sat himself down and fell asleep, almost without a sign. He did\r\nnot ask for a song, nor did Emily offer to sing. But as soon as Mrs.\r\nRoby was gone,--and Mrs. Roby went home, round the corner, somewhat\r\nearlier than usual,--then Mr. Wharton woke up instantly and made\r\ninquiry of his daughter.\r\n\r\nThere had, however, been a few words spoken on the subject between\r\nMrs. Roby and her niece which had served to prepare Emily for what\r\nwas coming. "Lopez has been to your father," said Mrs. Roby, in a\r\nvoice not specially encouraging for such an occasion. Then she paused\r\na moment; but her niece said nothing, and she continued, "Yes,--and\r\nyour father has been blaming me,--as if I had done anything! If he\r\ndid not mean you to choose for yourself, why didn\'t he keep a closer\r\nlook-out?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t chosen any one, Aunt Harriet."\r\n\r\n"Well;--to speak fairly, I thought you had; and I have nothing to say\r\nagainst your choice. As young men go, I think Mr. Lopez is as good\r\nas the best of them. I don\'t know why you shouldn\'t have him. Of\r\ncourse you\'ll have money, but then I suppose he makes a large income\r\nhimself. As to Mr. Fletcher, you don\'t care a bit about him."\r\n\r\n"Not in that way, certainly."\r\n\r\n"No doubt your papa will have it out with you just now; so you had\r\nbetter make up your mind what you will say to him. If you really like\r\nthe man, I don\'t see why you shouldn\'t say so, and stick to it. He\r\nhas made a regular offer, and girls in these days are not expected\r\nto be their father\'s slaves." Emily said nothing further to her aunt\r\non that occasion, but finding that she must in truth "have it out"\r\nwith her father presently, gave herself up to reflection. It might\r\nprobably be the case that the whole condition of her future life\r\nwould depend on the way in which she might now "have it out" with her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nI would not wish the reader to be prejudiced against Miss Wharton by\r\nthe not unnatural feeling which may perhaps be felt in regard to the\r\naunt. Mrs. Roby was pleased with little intrigues, was addicted to\r\nthe amusement of fostering love affairs, was fond of being thought\r\nto be useful in such matters, and was not averse to having presents\r\ngiven to her. She had married a vulgar man; and, though she had not\r\nbecome like the man, she had become vulgar. She was not an eligible\r\ncompanion for Mr. Wharton\'s daughter,--a matter as to which the\r\nfather had not given himself proper opportunities of learning the\r\nfacts. An aunt in his close neighbourhood was so great a comfort\r\nto him,--so ready and so natural an assistance to him in his\r\ndifficulties! But Emily Wharton was not in the least like her aunt,\r\nnor had Mrs. Wharton been at all like Mrs. Roby. No doubt the contact\r\nwas dangerous. Injury had perhaps already been done. It may be that\r\nsome slightest soil had already marred the pure white of the girl\'s\r\nnatural character. But if so, the stain was as yet too impalpable to\r\nbe visible to ordinary eyes.\r\n\r\nEmily Wharton was a tall, fair girl, with grey eyes, rather exceeding\r\nthe average proportions as well as height of women. Her features\r\nwere regular and handsome, and her form was perfect; but it was by\r\nher manner and her voice that she conquered, rather than by her\r\nbeauty,--by those gifts and by a clearness of intellect joined with\r\nthat feminine sweetness which has its most frequent foundation in\r\nself-denial. Those who knew her well, and had become attached to her,\r\nwere apt to endow her with all virtues, and to give her credit for\r\na loveliness which strangers did not find on her face. But as we do\r\nnot light up our houses with our brightest lamps for all comers,\r\nso neither did she emit from her eyes their brightest sparks till\r\nspecial occasion for such shining had arisen. To those who were\r\nallowed to love her no woman was more lovable. There was innate in\r\nher an appreciation of her own position as a woman, and with it a\r\nprinciple of self-denial as a human being, which it was beyond the\r\npower of any Mrs. Roby to destroy or even to defile by small stains.\r\n\r\nLike other girls she had been taught to presume that it was her\r\ndestiny to be married, and like other girls she had thought much\r\nabout her destiny. A young man generally regards it as his destiny\r\neither to succeed or to fail in the world, and he thinks about that.\r\nTo him marriage, when it comes, is an accident to which he has hardly\r\nas yet given a thought. But to the girl the matrimony which is or\r\nis not to be her destiny contains within itself the only success\r\nor failure which she anticipates. The young man may become Lord\r\nChancellor, or at any rate earn his bread comfortably as a county\r\ncourt judge. But the girl can look forward to little else than the\r\nchance of having a good man for her husband;--a good man, or if her\r\ntastes lie in that direction, a rich man. Emily Wharton had doubtless\r\nthought about these things, and she sincerely believed that she had\r\nfound the good man in Ferdinand Lopez.\r\n\r\nThe man, certainly, was one strangely endowed with the power of\r\ncreating a belief. When going to Mr. Wharton at his chambers he had\r\nnot intended to cheat the lawyer into any erroneous idea about his\r\nfamily, but he had resolved that he would so discuss the questions of\r\nhis own condition, which would probably be raised, as to leave upon\r\nthe old man\'s mind an unfounded conviction that in regard to money\r\nand income he had no reason to fear question. Not a word had been\r\nsaid about his money or his income. And Mr. Wharton had felt himself\r\nbound to abstain from allusion to such matters from an assured\r\nfeeling that he could not in that direction plant an enduring\r\nobjection. In this way Lopez had carried his point with Mr. Wharton.\r\nHe had convinced Mrs. Roby that among all the girl\'s attractions the\r\ngreatest attraction for him was the fact that she was Mrs. Roby\'s\r\nniece. He had made Emily herself believe that the one strong passion\r\nof his life was his love for her, and this he had done without ever\r\nhaving asked for her love. And he had even taken the trouble to\r\nallure Dick, and had listened to and had talked whole pages out of\r\n_Bell\'s Life_. On his own behalf it must be acknowledged that he\r\ndid love the girl, as well perhaps as he was capable of loving any\r\none;--but he had found out many particulars as to Mr. Wharton\'s money\r\nbefore he had allowed himself to love her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mrs. Roby had gathered up her knitting, and declared, as\r\nshe always did on such occasions, that she could go round the corner\r\nwithout having any one to look after her, Mr. Wharton began. "Emily,\r\nmy dear, come here." Then she came and sat on a footstool at his\r\nfeet, and looked up into his face. "Do you know what I am going to\r\nspeak to you about, my darling?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; I think I do. It is about--Mr. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"Your aunt has told you, I suppose. Yes; it is about Mr. Lopez. I\r\nhave been very much astonished to-day by Mr. Lopez,--a man of whom I\r\nhave seen very little and know less. He came to me to-day and asked\r\nfor my permission--to address you." She sat perfectly quiet, still\r\nlooking at him, but she did not say a word. "Of course I did not give\r\nhim permission."\r\n\r\n"Why of course, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Because he is a stranger and a foreigner. Would you have wished me\r\nto tell him that he might come?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa." He was sitting on a sofa and shrank back a little from\r\nher as she made this free avowal. "In that case I could have judged\r\nfor myself. I suppose every girl would like to do that."\r\n\r\n"But should you have accepted him?"\r\n\r\n"I think I should have consulted you before I did that. But I should\r\nhave wished to accept him. Papa, I do love him. I have never said so\r\nbefore to any one. I would not say so to you now, if he had\r\nnot--spoken to you as he has done."\r\n\r\n"Emily, it must not be."\r\n\r\n"Why not, papa? If you say it shall not be so, it shall not. I\r\nwill do as you bid me." Then he put out his hand and caressed her,\r\nstroking down her hair. "But I think you ought to tell me why it must\r\nnot be,--as I do love him."\r\n\r\n"He is a foreigner."\r\n\r\n"But is he? And why should not a foreigner be as good as an\r\nEnglishman? His name is foreign, but he talks English and lives as an\r\nEnglishman."\r\n\r\n"He has no relatives, no family, no belongings. He is what we call an\r\nadventurer. Marriage, my dear, is a most serious thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I know that."\r\n\r\n"One is bound to be very careful. How can I give you to a man I know\r\nnothing about,--an adventurer? What would they say in Herefordshire?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why they should say anything, but if they did I\r\nshouldn\'t much care."\r\n\r\n"I should, my dear. I should care very much. One is bound to think\r\nof one\'s family. Suppose it should turn out afterwards that he\r\nwas--disreputable!"\r\n\r\n"You may say that of any man, papa."\r\n\r\n"But when a man has connexions, a father and mother, or uncles\r\nand aunts, people that everybody knows about, then there is some\r\nguarantee of security. Did you ever hear this man speak of his\r\nfather?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I ever did."\r\n\r\n"Or his mother,--or his family? Don\'t you think that is suspicious?"\r\n\r\n"I will ask him, papa, if you wish."\r\n\r\n"No, I would have you ask him nothing. I would not wish that there\r\nshould be opportunity for such asking. If there has been intimacy\r\nbetween you, such information should have come naturally,--as a thing\r\nof course. You have made him no promise?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, papa."\r\n\r\n"Nor spoken to him--of your regard for him?"\r\n\r\n"Never;--not a word. Nor he to me,--except in such words as one\r\nunderstands even though they say nothing."\r\n\r\n"I wish he had never seen you."\r\n\r\n"Is he a bad man, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Who knows? I cannot tell. He may be ever so bad. How is one to know\r\nwhether a man be bad or good when one knows nothing about him?" At\r\nthis point the father got up and walked about the room. "The long and\r\nthe short of it is that you must not see him any more."\r\n\r\n"Did you tell him so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--well; I don\'t know whether I said exactly that, but I told him\r\nthat the whole thing must come to an end. And it must. Luckily it\r\nseems that nothing has been said on either side."\r\n\r\n"But, papa--; is there to be no reason?"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I given reasons? I will not have my daughter encourage an\r\nadventurer,--a man of whom nobody knows anything. That is reason\r\nsufficient."\r\n\r\n"He has a business, and he lives with gentlemen. He is Everett\'s\r\nfriend. He is well educated;--oh, so much better than most men that\r\none meets. And he is clever. Papa, I wish you knew him better than\r\nyou do."\r\n\r\n"I do not want to know him better."\r\n\r\n"Is not that prejudice, papa?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Emily," said Mr. Wharton, striving to wax into anger that he\r\nmight be firm against her, "I don\'t think that it becomes you to ask\r\nyour father such a question as that. You ought to believe that it is\r\nthe chief object of my life to do the best I can for my children."\r\n\r\n"I am sure it is."\r\n\r\n"And you ought to feel that, as I have had a long experience in the\r\nworld, my judgment about a young man might be trusted."\r\n\r\nThat was a statement which Miss Wharton was not prepared to admit.\r\nShe had already professed herself willing to submit to her father\'s\r\njudgment, and did not now by any means contemplate rebellion against\r\nparental authority. But she did feel that on a matter so vital to her\r\nshe had a right to plead her cause before judgment should be given,\r\nand she was not slow to assure herself, even as this interview went\r\non, that her love for the man was strong enough to entitle her to\r\nassure her father that her happiness depended on his reversal of the\r\nsentence already pronounced. "You know, papa, that I trust you," she\r\nsaid. "And I have promised you that I will not disobey you. If you\r\ntell me that I am never to see Mr. Lopez again, I will not see him."\r\n\r\n"You are a good girl. You were always a good girl."\r\n\r\n"But I think that you ought to hear me." Then he stood still with his\r\nhands in his trowsers pockets looking at her. He did not want to hear\r\na word, but he felt that he would be a tyrant if he refused. "If you\r\ntell me that I am not to see him, I shall not see him. But I shall be\r\nvery unhappy. I do love him, and I shall never love any one else in\r\nthe same way."\r\n\r\n"That is nonsense, Emily. There is Arthur Fletcher."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you will never ask me to marry a man I do not love, and\r\nI shall never love Arthur Fletcher. If this is to be as you say, it\r\nwill make me very, very wretched. It is right that you should know\r\nthe truth. If it is only because Mr. Lopez has a foreign name--"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t only that; no one knows anything about him, or where to\r\ninquire even."\r\n\r\n"I think you should inquire, papa, and be quite certain before you\r\npronounce such a sentence against me. It will be a crushing blow."\r\nHe looked at her, and saw that there was a fixed purpose in her\r\ncountenance of which he had never before seen similar signs. "You\r\nclaim a right to my obedience, and I acknowledge it. I am sure you\r\nbelieve me when I promise not to see him without your permission."\r\n\r\n"I do believe you. Of course I believe you."\r\n\r\n"But if I do that for you, papa, I think that you ought to be very\r\nsure, on my account, that I haven\'t to bear such unhappiness for\r\nnothing. You\'ll think about it, papa,--will you not, before you quite\r\ndecide?" She leaned against him as she spoke, and he kissed her.\r\n"Good night, now, papa. You will think about it?"\r\n\r\n"I will. I will. Of course I will."\r\n\r\nAnd he began the process of thinking about it immediately,--before\r\nthe door was closed behind her. But what was there to think about?\r\nNothing that she had said altered in the least his idea about the\r\nman. He was as convinced as ever that unless there was much to\r\nconceal there would not be so much concealment. But a feeling began\r\nto grow upon him already that his daughter had a mode of pleading\r\nwith him which he would not ultimately be able to resist. He had the\r\npower, he knew, of putting an end to the thing altogether. He had\r\nonly to say resolutely and unchangeably that the thing shouldn\'t\r\nbe, and it wouldn\'t be. If he could steel his heart against his\r\ndaughter\'s sorrow for, say, a twelvemonth, the victory would be won.\r\nBut he already began to fear that he lacked the power to steel his\r\nheart against his daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAn Old Friend Goes to Windsor\r\n\r\n\r\n"And what are they going to make you now?"\r\n\r\nThis question was asked of her husband by a lady with whom perhaps\r\nthe readers of this volume may have already formed some acquaintance.\r\nChronicles of her early life have been written, at any rate\r\ncopiously. The lady was the Duchess of Omnium, and her husband was of\r\ncourse the Duke. In order that the nature of the question asked by\r\nthe duchess may be explained, it must be stated that just at this\r\ntime the political affairs of the nation had got themselves tied up\r\ninto one of those truly desperate knots from which even the wisdom\r\nand experience of septuagenarian statesmen can see no unravelment.\r\nThe heads of parties were at a standstill. In the House of Commons\r\nthere was, so to say, no majority on either side. The minds of\r\nmembers were so astray that, according to the best calculation that\r\ncould be made, there would be a majority of about ten against any\r\npossible Cabinet. There would certainly be a majority against either\r\nof those well-tried but, at this moment, little-trusted Prime\r\nMinisters, Mr. Gresham and Mr. Daubeny. There were certain men,\r\nnominally belonging to this or to the other party, who would\r\ncertainly within a week of the nomination of a Cabinet in the House,\r\noppose the Cabinet which they ought to support. Mr. Daubeny had\r\nbeen in power,--nay, was in power, though he had twice resigned. Mr.\r\nGresham had been twice sent for to Windsor, and had on one occasion\r\nundertaken and on another had refused to undertake to form a\r\nMinistry. Mr. Daubeny had tried two or three combinations, and had\r\nbeen at his wits\' end. He was no doubt still in power,--could appoint\r\nbishops, and make peers, and give away ribbons. But he couldn\'t pass\r\na law, and certainly continued to hold his present uncomfortable\r\nposition by no will of his own. But a Prime Minister cannot escape\r\ntill he has succeeded in finding a successor; and though the\r\nsuccessor be found and consents to make an attempt, the old\r\nunfortunate cannot be allowed to go free when that attempt is shown\r\nto be a failure. He has not absolutely given up the keys of his\r\nboxes, and no one will take them from him. Even a sovereign can\r\nabdicate; but the Prime Minister of a constitutional government\r\nis in bonds. The reader may therefore understand that the Duchess\r\nwas asking her husband what place among the political rulers of\r\nthe country had been offered to him by the last aspirant to the\r\nleadership of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut the reader should understand more than this, and may perhaps do\r\nso, if he has ever seen those former chronicles to which allusion\r\nhas been made. The Duke, before he became a duke, had held very\r\nhigh office, having been Chancellor of the Exchequer. When he was\r\ntransferred, perforce, to the House of Lords, he had,--as is not\r\nuncommon in such cases,--accepted a lower political station. This had\r\ndispleased the Duchess, who was ambitious both on her own behalf and\r\nthat of her lord,--and who thought that a Duke of Omnium should be\r\nnothing in the Government if not at any rate near the top. But after\r\nthat, with the simple and single object of doing some special piece\r\nof work for the nation,--something which he fancied that nobody else\r\nwould do if he didn\'t do it,--his Grace, of his own motion, at his\r\nown solicitation, had encountered further official degradation, very\r\nmuch to the disgust of the Duchess. And it was not the way with her\r\nGrace to hide such sorrows in the depth of her bosom. When affronted\r\nshe would speak out, whether to her husband, or to another,--using\r\nirony rather than argument to support her cause and to vindicate her\r\nways. The shafts of ridicule hurled by her against her husband in\r\nregard to his voluntary abasement had been many and sharp. They stung\r\nhim, but never for a moment influenced him. And though they stung\r\nhim, they did not even anger him. It was her nature to say such\r\nthings,--and he knew that they came rather from her uncontrolled\r\nspirit than from any malice. She was his wife too, and he had an\r\nidea that of little injuries of that sort there should be no end of\r\nbearing on the part of a husband. Sometimes he would endeavour to\r\nexplain to her the motives which actuated him; but he had come to\r\nfear that they were and must ever be unintelligible to her. But he\r\ncredited her with less than her real intelligence. She did understand\r\nthe nature of his work and his reasons for doing it; and, after\r\nher own fashion, did what she conceived to be her own work in\r\nendeavouring to create within his bosom a desire for higher things.\r\n"Surely," she said to herself, "if a man of his rank is to be a\r\nminister he should be a great minister;--at any rate as great as his\r\ncircumstances will make him. A man never can save his country by\r\ndegrading himself." In this he would probably have agreed; but his\r\nidea of degradation and hers hardly tallied.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore she asked him what they were going to make him, it\r\nwas as though some sarcastic housekeeper in a great establishment\r\nshould ask the butler,--some butler too prone to yield in such\r\nmatters,--whether the master had appointed him lately to the cleaning\r\nof shoes or the carrying of coals. Since these knots had become so\r\nvery tight, and since the journeys to Windsor had become so very\r\nfrequent, her Grace had asked many such questions, and had received\r\nbut very indifferent replies. The Duke had sometimes declared that\r\nthe matter was not ripe enough to allow him to make any answer. "Of\r\ncourse," said the Duchess, "you should keep the secret. The editors\r\nof the evening papers haven\'t known it for above an hour." At\r\nanother time he told her that he had undertaken to give Mr. Gresham\r\nhis assistance in any way in which it might be asked. "Joint\r\nUnder-Secretary with Lord Fawn, I should say," answered the Duchess.\r\nThen he told her that he believed an attempt would be made at a mixed\r\nministry, but that he did not in the least know to whom the work of\r\ndoing so would be confided. "You will be about the last man who will\r\nbe told," replied the Duchess. Now, at this moment, he had, as she\r\nknew, come direct from the house of Mr. Gresham, and she asked her\r\nquestion in her usual spirit. "And what are they going to make you\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\nBut he did not answer the question in his usual manner. He would\r\ncustomarily smile gently at her badinage, and perhaps say a word\r\nintended to show that he was not in the least moved by her raillery.\r\nBut in this instance he was very grave, and stood before her a moment\r\nmaking no answer at all, looking at her in a sad and almost solemn\r\nmanner. "They have told you that they can do without you," she said,\r\nbreaking out almost into a passion. "I knew how it would be. Men are\r\nalways valued by others as they value themselves."\r\n\r\n"I wish it were so," he replied. "I should sleep easier to-night."\r\n\r\n"What is it, Plantagenet?" she exclaimed, jumping up from her chair.\r\n\r\n"I never cared for your ridicule hitherto, Cora; but now I feel that\r\nI want your sympathy."\r\n\r\n"If you are going to do anything,--to do really anything, you shall\r\nhave it. Oh, how you shall have it!"\r\n\r\n"I have received her Majesty\'s orders to go down to Windsor at once.\r\nI must start within half-an-hour."\r\n\r\n"You are going to be Prime Minister!" she exclaimed. As she spoke\r\nshe threw her arms up, and then rushed into his embrace. Never since\r\ntheir first union had she been so demonstrative either of love or\r\nadmiration. "Oh, Plantagenet," she said, "if I can only do anything\r\nI will slave for you." As he put his arm round her waist he already\r\nfelt the pleasantness of her altered way to him. She had never\r\nworshipped him yet, and therefore her worship when it did come had\r\nall the delight to him which it ordinarily has to the newly married\r\nhero.\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment, Cora. I do not know how it may be yet. But this I\r\nknow, that if without cowardice I could avoid this task, I would\r\ncertainly avoid it."\r\n\r\n"Oh no! And there would be cowardice; of course there would," said\r\nthe Duchess, not much caring what might be the bonds which bound him\r\nto the task so long as he should certainly feel himself to be bound.\r\n\r\n"He has told me that he thinks it my duty to make the attempt."\r\n\r\n"Who is he?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gresham. I do not know that I should have felt myself bound by\r\nhim, but the Duke said so also." This duke was our duke\'s old friend,\r\nthe Duke of St. Bungay.\r\n\r\n"Was he there? And who else?"\r\n\r\n"No one else. It is no case for exultation, Cora, for the chances are\r\nthat I shall fail. The Duke has promised to help me, on condition\r\nthat one or two he has named are included, and that one or two whom\r\nhe has also named are not. In each case I should myself have done\r\nexactly as he proposes."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Gresham?"\r\n\r\n"He will retire. That is a matter of course. He will intend to\r\nsupport us; but all that is veiled in the obscurity which is always,\r\nI think, darker as to the future of politics than any other future.\r\nClouds arise, one knows not why or whence, and create darkness when\r\none expected light. But as yet, you must understand, nothing is\r\nsettled. I cannot even say what answer I may make to her Majesty,\r\ntill I know what commands her Majesty may lay upon me."\r\n\r\n"You must keep a hold of it now, Plantagenet," said the Duchess,\r\nclenching her own fist.\r\n\r\n"I will not even close a finger on it with any personal ambition,"\r\nsaid the Duke. "If I could be relieved from the burden this moment\r\nit would be an ease to my heart. I remember once," he said,--and as\r\nhe spoke he again put his arm around her waist, "when I was debarred\r\nfrom taking office by a domestic circumstance."\r\n\r\n"I remember that too," she said, speaking very gently and looking up\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n"It was a grief to me at the time, though it turned out so\r\nwell,--because the office then suggested to me was one which I\r\nthought I could fill with credit to the country. I believed in myself\r\nthen as far as that work went. But for this attempt I have no belief\r\nin myself. I doubt whether I have any gift for governing men."\r\n\r\n"It will come."\r\n\r\n"It may be that I must try;--and it may be that I must break my heart\r\nbecause I fail. But I shall make the attempt if I am directed to do\r\nso in any manner that shall seem feasible. I must be off now. The\r\nDuke is to be here this evening. They had better have dinner ready\r\nfor me whenever I may be able to eat it." Then he took his departure\r\nbefore she could say another word.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duchess was alone she took to thinking of the whole thing in\r\na manner which they who best knew her would have thought to be very\r\nunusual with her. She already possessed all that rank and wealth\r\ncould give her, and together with those good things a peculiar\r\nposition of her own, of which she was proud, and which she had made\r\nher own not by her wealth or rank, but by a certain fearless energy\r\nand power of raillery which never deserted her. Many feared her\r\nand she was afraid of none, and many also loved her,--whom she also\r\nloved, for her nature was affectionate. She was happy with her\r\nchildren, happy with her friends, in the enjoyment of perfect health,\r\nand capable of taking an exaggerated interest in anything that might\r\ncome uppermost for the moment. One would have been inclined to say\r\nthat politics were altogether unnecessary to her, and that as Duchess\r\nof Omnium, lately known as Lady Glencora Palliser, she had a wider\r\nand a pleasanter influence than could belong to any woman as wife\r\nof a Prime Minister. And she was essentially one of those women who\r\nare not contented to be known simply as the wives of their husbands.\r\nShe had a celebrity of her own, quite independent of his position,\r\nand which could not be enhanced by any glory or any power added to\r\nhim. Nevertheless, when he left her to go down to the Queen with\r\nthe prospect of being called upon to act as chief of the incoming\r\nministry, her heart throbbed with excitement. It had come at last,\r\nand he would be, to her thinking, the leading man in the greatest\r\nkingdom in the world.\r\n\r\nBut she felt in regard to him somewhat as did Lady Macbeth towards\r\nher lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n      "What thou would\'st highly,\r\n   That would\'st thou holily."\r\n\r\n\r\nShe knew him to be full of scruples, unable to bend when aught was to\r\nbe got by bending, unwilling to domineer when men might be brought to\r\nsubjection only by domination. The first duty never could be taught\r\nto him. To win support by smiles when his heart was bitter within him\r\nwould never be within the power of her husband. He could never be\r\nbrought to buy an enemy by political gifts,--would never be prone to\r\nsilence his keenest opponent by making him his right hand supporter.\r\nBut the other lesson was easier and might she thought be learned.\r\nPower is so pleasant that men quickly learn to be greedy in the\r\nenjoyment of it, and to flatter themselves that patriotism requires\r\nthem to be imperious. She would be constant with him day and night to\r\nmake him understand that his duty to his country required him to be\r\nin very truth its chief ruler. And then with some knowledge of things\r\nas they are,--and also with much ignorance,--she reflected that he\r\nhad at his command a means of obtaining popularity and securing\r\npower, which had not belonged to his immediate predecessors, and had\r\nperhaps never to the same extent been at the command of any minister\r\nin England. His wealth as Duke of Omnium had been great; but hers,\r\nas available for immediate purposes, had been greater even than his.\r\nAfter some fashion, of which she was profoundly ignorant, her own\r\nproperty was separated from his and reserved to herself and her\r\nchildren. Since her marriage she had never said a word to him about\r\nher money,--unless it were to ask that something out of the common\r\ncourse might be spent on some, generally absurd, object. But now had\r\ncome the time for squandering money. She was not only rich but she\r\nhad a popularity that was exclusively her own. The new Prime Minister\r\nand the new Prime Minister\'s wife should entertain after a fashion\r\nthat had never yet been known even among the nobility of England.\r\nBoth in town and country those great mansions should be kept open\r\nwhich were now rarely much used because she had found them dull,\r\ncold, and comfortless. In London there should not be a Member\r\nof Parliament whom she would not herself know and influence by\r\nher flattery and grace,--or if there were men whom she could not\r\ninfluence, they should live as men tabooed and unfortunate. Money\r\nmattered nothing. Their income was enormous, and for a series of\r\nyears,--for half-a-dozen years if the game could be kept up so\r\nlong,--they could spend treble what they called their income without\r\nreal injury to their children. Visions passed through her brain of\r\nwondrous things which might be done,--if only her husband would be\r\ntrue to his own greatness.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had left her about two. She did not stir out of the house\r\nthat day, but in the course of the afternoon she wrote a line to a\r\nfriend who lived not very far from her. The Duchess dwelt in Carlton\r\nTerrace, and her friend in Park Lane. The note was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR M.,\r\n\r\n   Come to me at once. I am too excited to go to you.\r\n\r\n   Yours,\r\n\r\n   G.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to one Mrs. Finn, a lady as to whom chronicles\r\nalso have been written, and who has been known to the readers of such\r\nchronicles as a friend dearly loved by the Duchess. As quickly as she\r\ncould put on her carriage garments and get herself taken to Carlton\r\nTerrace, Mrs. Finn was there. "Well, my dear, how do you think it\'s\r\nall settled at last?" said the Duchess. It will probably be felt that\r\nthe new Prime Minister\'s wife was indiscreet, and hardly worthy of\r\nthe confidence placed in her by her husband. But surely we all have\r\nsome one friend to whom we tell everything, and with the Duchess Mrs.\r\nFinn was that one friend.\r\n\r\n"Is the Duke to be Prime Minister?"\r\n\r\n"How on earth should you have guessed that?"\r\n\r\n"What else could make you so excited? Besides, it is by no means\r\nstrange. I understand that they have gone on trying the two old\r\nstagers till it is useless to try them any longer; and if there is to\r\nbe a fresh man, no one would be more likely than the Duke."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Why not?"\r\n\r\n"He has frittered away his political position by such meaningless\r\nconcessions. And then he had never done anything to put himself\r\nforward,--at any rate since he left the House of Commons. Perhaps\r\nI haven\'t read things right,--but I was surprised, very much\r\nsurprised."\r\n\r\n"And gratified?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. I can tell you everything, because you will neither\r\nmisunderstand me nor tell tales of me. Yes,--I shall like him to be\r\nPrime Minister, though I know that I shall have a bad time of it\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"Why a bad time?"\r\n\r\n"He is so hard to manage. Of course I don\'t mean about politics. Of\r\ncourse it must be a mixed kind of thing at first, and I don\'t care\r\na straw whether it run to Radicalism or Toryism. The country goes\r\non its own way, either for better or for worse, whichever of them\r\nare in. I don\'t think it makes any difference as to what sort of\r\nlaws are passed. But among ourselves, in our set, it makes a deal\r\nof difference who gets the garters, and the counties, who are\r\nmade barons and then earls, and whose name stands at the head of\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"That is your way of looking at politics?"\r\n\r\n"I own it to you;--and I must teach it to him."\r\n\r\n"You never will do that, Lady Glen."\r\n\r\n"Never is a long word. I mean to try. For look back and tell me of\r\nany Prime Minister who has become sick of his power. They become sick\r\nof the want of power when it\'s falling away from them,--and then they\r\naffect to disdain and put aside the thing they can no longer enjoy.\r\nLove of power is a kind of feeling which comes to a man as he grows\r\nolder."\r\n\r\n"Politics with the Duke have been simple patriotism," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"The patriotism may remain, my dear, but not the simplicity. I don\'t\r\nwant him to sell his country to Germany, or to turn it into an\r\nAmerican republic in order that he may be president. But when he gets\r\nthe reins in his hands, I want him to keep them there. If he\'s so\r\nmuch honester than other people, of course he\'s the best man for\r\nthe place. We must make him believe that the very existence of the\r\ncountry depends on his firmness."\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, Lady Glen, I don\'t think you\'ll ever make the\r\nDuke believe anything. What he believes, he believes either from very\r\nold habit, or from the working of his own mind."\r\n\r\n"You\'re always singing his praises, Marie."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that there is any special praise in what I say; but as\r\nfar as I can see, it is the man\'s character."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn will come in, of course," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn will be like the Duke in one thing. He\'ll take his own way\r\nas to being in or out quite independently of his wife."\r\n\r\n"You\'d like him to be in office?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed! Why should I? He would be more often at the House,\r\nand keep later hours, and be always away all the morning into the\r\nbargain. But I shall like him to do as he likes himself."\r\n\r\n"Fancy thinking of all that. I\'d sit up all night every night of\r\nmy life.--I\'d listen to every debate in the House myself,--to have\r\nPlantagenet Prime Minister. I like to be busy. Well now, if it does\r\ncome off--"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t settled, then?"\r\n\r\n"How can one hope that a single journey will settle it, when those\r\nother men have been going backwards and forwards between Windsor and\r\nLondon, like buckets in a well, for the last three weeks? But if it\r\nis settled, I mean to have a cabinet of my own, and I mean that you\r\nshall do the foreign affairs."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better let me be at the exchequer. I\'m very good at accounts."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do that myself. The accounts that I intend to set a-going\r\nwould frighten any one less audacious. And I mean to be my own home\r\nsecretary, and to keep my own conscience,--and to be my own master of\r\nthe ceremonies certainly. I think a small cabinet gets on best. Do\r\nyou know,--I should like to put the Queen down."\r\n\r\n"What on earth do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"No treason; nothing of that kind. But I should like to make\r\nBuckingham Palace second-rate; and I\'m not quite sure but I can. I\r\ndare say you don\'t quite understand me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that I do, Lady Glen."\r\n\r\n"You will some of these days. Come in to-morrow before lunch. I\r\nsuppose I shall know all about it then, and shall have found that my\r\nbasket of crockery has been kicked over and every thing smashed."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nAnother Old Friend\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about nine the Duke had returned, and was eating his very simple\r\ndinner in the breakfast-room,--a beefsteak and a potato, with a glass\r\nof sherry and Apollinaris water. No man more easily satisfied as to\r\nwhat he eat and drank lived in London in those days. As regarded the\r\neating and drinking he dined alone, but his wife sat with him and\r\nwaited on him, having sent the servant out of the room. "I have told\r\nher Majesty that I would do the best I could," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Then you are Prime Minister."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. Mr. Daubeny is Prime Minister. I have undertaken to form\r\na ministry, if I find it practicable, with the assistance of such\r\nfriends as I possess. I never felt before that I had to lean so\r\nentirely on others as I do now."\r\n\r\n"Lean on yourself only. Be enough for yourself."\r\n\r\n"Those are empty words, Cora;--words that are quite empty. In one\r\nsense a man should always be enough for himself. He should have\r\nenough of principle and enough of conscience to restrain him from\r\ndoing what he knows to be wrong. But can a ship-builder build\r\nhis ship single-handed, or the watchmaker make his watch without\r\nassistance? On former occasions such as this, I could say, with\r\nlittle or no help from without, whether I would or would not\r\nundertake the work that was proposed to me, because I had only a\r\nbit of the ship to build, or a wheel of the watch to make. My own\r\nefficacy for my present task depends entirely on the co-operation of\r\nothers, and unfortunately upon that of some others with whom I have\r\nno sympathy, nor have they with me."\r\n\r\n"Leave them out," said the Duchess boldly.\r\n\r\n"But they are men who will not be left out, and whose services the\r\ncountry has a right to expect."\r\n\r\n"Then bring them in, and think no more about it. It is no good crying\r\nfor pain that cannot be cured."\r\n\r\n"Co-operation is difficult without community of feeling. I find\r\nmyself to be too stubborn-hearted for the place. It was nothing to me\r\nto sit in the same Cabinet with a man I disliked when I had not put\r\nhim there myself. But now--. As I have travelled up I have almost\r\nfelt that I could not do it! I did not know before how much I might\r\ndislike a man."\r\n\r\n"Who is the one man?"\r\n\r\n"Nay;--whoever he be, he will have to be a friend now, and therefore\r\nI will not name him, even to you. But it is not one only. If it were\r\none, absolutely marked and recognised, I might avoid him. But my\r\nfriends, real friends, are so few! Who is there besides the Duke on\r\nwhom I can lean with both confidence and love?"\r\n\r\n"Lord Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"Hardly so, Cora. But Lord Cantrip goes out with Mr. Gresham. They\r\nwill always cling together."\r\n\r\n"You used to like Mr. Mildmay."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Mildmay,--yes! If there could be a Mr. Mildmay in the Cabinet,\r\nthis trouble would not come upon my shoulders."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m very glad that there can\'t be a Mr. Mildmay. Why shouldn\'t\r\nthere be as good fish in the sea as ever were caught out of it?"\r\n\r\n"When you\'ve got a good fish you like to make as much of it as you\r\ncan."\r\n\r\n"I suppose Mr. Monk will join you."\r\n\r\n"I think we shall ask him. But I am not prepared to discuss men\'s\r\nnames as yet."\r\n\r\n"You must discuss them with the Duke immediately."\r\n\r\n"Probably;--but I had better discuss them with him before I fix my\r\nown mind by naming them even to you."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll bring Mr. Finn in, Plantagenet?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--Phineas Finn,--the man who was tried."\r\n\r\n"My dear Cora, we haven\'t come down to that yet. We need not at any\r\nrate trouble ourselves about the small fishes till we are sure that\r\nwe can get big fishes to join us."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why he should be a small fish. No man has done better\r\nthan he has; and if you want a man to stick to you--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want a man to stick to me. I want a man to stick to his\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"You were talking about sympathy."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes;--I was. But do not name any one else just at present. The\r\nDuke will be here soon, and I would be alone till he comes."\r\n\r\n"There is one thing I want to say, Plantagenet."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"One favour I want to ask."\r\n\r\n"Pray do not ask anything for any man just at present."\r\n\r\n"It is not anything for any man."\r\n\r\n"Nor for any woman."\r\n\r\n"It is for a woman,--but one whom I think you would wish to oblige."\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" Then she curtseyed, smiling at him drolly, and put her\r\nhand upon her breast. "Something for you! What on earth can you want\r\nthat I can do for you?"\r\n\r\n"Will you do it,--if it be reasonable?"\r\n\r\n"If I think it reasonable, I certainly will do it."\r\n\r\nThen her manner changed altogether, and she became serious and almost\r\nsolemn. "If, as I suppose, all the great places about her Majesty be\r\nchanged, I should like to be Mistress of the Robes."\r\n\r\n"You!" said he, almost startled out of his usual quiet demeanour.\r\n\r\n"Why not I? Is not my rank high enough?"\r\n\r\n"You burden yourself with the intricacies and subserviences, with the\r\ntedium and pomposities of Court life! Cora, you do not know what you\r\nare talking about, or what you are proposing for yourself."\r\n\r\n"If I am willing to try to undertake a duty, why should I be debarred\r\nfrom it any more than you?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have put myself into a groove, and ground myself into a\r\nmould, and clipped and pared and pinched myself all round,--very\r\nineffectually, as I fear,--to fit myself for this thing. You have\r\nlived as free as air. You have disdained,--and though I may have\r\ngrumbled I have still been proud to see you disdain,--to wrap\r\nyourself in the swaddling bandages of Court life. You have ridiculed\r\nall those who have been near her Majesty as Court ladies."\r\n\r\n"The individuals, Plantagenet, perhaps; but not the office. I am\r\ngetting older now, and I do not see why I should not begin a new\r\nlife." She had been somewhat quelled by his unexpected energy, and\r\nwas at the moment hardly able to answer him with her usual spirit.\r\n\r\n"Do not think of it, my dear. You asked whether your rank was high\r\nenough. It must be so, as there is, as it happens, none higher. But\r\nyour position, should it come to pass that your husband is the head\r\nof the Government, will be too high. I may say that in no condition\r\nshould I wish my wife to be subject to other restraint than that\r\nwhich is common to all married women. I should not choose that she\r\nshould have any duties unconnected with our joint family and home.\r\nBut as First Minister of the Crown I would altogether object to her\r\nholding an office believed to be at my disposal." She looked at him\r\nwith her large eyes wide open, and then left him without a word. She\r\nhad no other way of showing her displeasure, for she knew that when\r\nhe spoke as he had spoken now all argument was unavailing.\r\n\r\nThe Duke remained an hour alone before he was joined by the other\r\nDuke, during which he did not for a moment apply his mind to\r\nthe subject which might be thought to be most prominent in his\r\nthoughts,--the filling up, namely, of a list of his new government.\r\nAll that he could do in that direction without further assistance\r\nhad been already done very easily. There were four or five certain\r\nnames,--names that is of certain political friends, and three or four\r\nalmost equally certain of men who had been political enemies, but who\r\nwould now clearly be asked to join the ministry. Sir Gregory Grogram,\r\nthe late Attorney-General, would of course be asked to resume\r\nhis place; but Sir Timothy Beeswax, who was up to this moment\r\nSolicitor-General for the Conservatives, would also be invited to\r\nretain that which he held. Many details were known, not only to the\r\ntwo dukes who were about to patch up the ministry between them, but\r\nto the political world at large,--and were facts upon which the\r\nnewspapers were able to display their wonderful foresight and general\r\nomniscience with their usual confidence. And as to the points which\r\nwere in doubt,--whether or not, for instance, that consistent\r\nold Tory Sir Orlando Drought should be asked to put up with the\r\nPost-office or should be allowed to remain at the Colonies,--the\r\nyounger Duke did not care to trouble himself till the elder\r\nshould have come to his assistance. But his own position and his\r\nquestionable capacity for filling it,--that occupied all his mind. If\r\nnominally first he would be really first. Of so much it seemed to him\r\nthat his honour required him to assure himself. To be a _faineant_\r\nruler was in direct antagonism both to his conscience and his\r\npredilections. To call himself by a great name before the world, and\r\nthen to be something infinitely less than that name, would be to him\r\na degradation. But though he felt fixed as to that, he was by no\r\nmeans assured as to that other point, which to most men firm in their\r\nresolves as he was, and backed up as he had been by the confidence of\r\nothers, would be cause of small hesitation. He did doubt his ability\r\nto fill that place which it would now be his duty to occupy. He more\r\nthan doubted. He told himself again and again that there was wanting\r\nto him a certain noble capacity for commanding support and homage\r\nfrom other men. With things and facts he could deal, but human beings\r\nhad not opened themselves to him. But now it was too late! and\r\nyet,--as he said to his wife,--to fail would break his heart! No\r\nambition had prompted him. He was sure of himself there. One only\r\nconsideration had forced him into this great danger, and that had\r\nbeen the assurance of others that it was his manifest duty to\r\nencounter it. And now there was clearly no escape,--no escape\r\ncompatible with that clean-handed truth from which it was not\r\npossible for him to swerve. He might create difficulties in order\r\nthat through them a way might still be opened to him of restoring to\r\nthe Queen the commission which had been entrusted to him. He might\r\ninsist on this or that impossible concession. But the memory of\r\nescape such as that would break his heart as surely as the failure.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke was announced he rose to greet his old friend almost\r\nwith fervour. "It is a shame," he said, "to bring you out so late. I\r\nought to have gone to you."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. It is always the rule in these cases that the man who\r\nhas most to do should fix himself as well as he can where others may\r\nbe able to find him." The Duke of St. Bungay was an old man, between\r\nseventy and eighty, with hair nearly white, and who on entering\r\nthe room had to unfold himself out of various coats and comforters.\r\nBut he was in full possession not only of his intellects but of\r\nhis bodily power, showing, as many politicians do show, that the\r\ncares of the nation may sit upon a man\'s shoulders for many years\r\nwithout breaking or even bending them. For the Duke had belonged to\r\nministries for nearly the last half century. As the chronicles have\r\nalso dealt with him, no further records of his past life shall now be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nHe had said something about the Queen, expressing gracious wishes for\r\nthe comfort of her Majesty in all these matters, something of the\r\ninconvenience of these political journeys to and fro, something also\r\nof the delicacy and difficulty of the operations on hand which were\r\nenhanced by the necessity of bringing men together as cordial allies\r\nwho had hitherto acted with bitter animosity one to another, before\r\nthe younger Duke said a word. "We may as well," said the elder, "make\r\nout some small provisional list, and you can ask those you name to be\r\nwith you early to-morrow. But perhaps you have already made a list."\r\n\r\n"No indeed. I have not even had a pencil in my hand."\r\n\r\n"We may as well begin then," said the elder, facing the table when he\r\nsaw that his less-experienced companion made no attempt at beginning.\r\n\r\n"There is something horrible to me in the idea of writing down men\'s\r\nnames for such a work as this, just as boys at school used to draw\r\nout the elevens for a cricket match." The old stager turned round and\r\nstared at the younger politician. "The thing itself is so momentous\r\nthat one ought to have aid from heaven."\r\n\r\nPlantagenet Palliser was the last man from whom the Duke of St.\r\nBungay would have expected romance at any time, and, least of all,\r\nat such a time as this. "Aid from heaven you may have," he said, "by\r\nsaying your prayers; and I don\'t doubt you ask it for this and all\r\nother things generally. But an angel won\'t come to tell you who ought\r\nto be Chancellor of the Exchequer."\r\n\r\n"No angel will, and therefore I wish that I could wash my hands of\r\nit." His old friend still stared at him. "It is like sacrilege to me,\r\nattempting this without feeling one\'s own fitness for the work. It\r\nunmans me,--this necessity of doing that which I know I cannot do\r\nwith fitting judgment."\r\n\r\n"Your mind has been a little too hard at work to-day."\r\n\r\n"It hasn\'t been at work at all. I\'ve had nothing to do, and have been\r\nunable really to think of work. But I feel that chance circumstances\r\nhave put me into a position for which I am unfit, and which yet I\r\nhave been unable to avoid. How much better would it be that you\r\nshould do this alone,--you yourself."\r\n\r\n"Utterly out of the question. I do know and think that I always\r\nhave known my own powers. Neither has my aptitude in debate nor my\r\ncapacity for work justified me in looking to the premiership. But\r\nthat, forgive me, is now not worthy of consideration. It is because\r\nyou do work and can work, and because you have fitted yourself for\r\nthat continued course of lucid explanation which we now call debate,\r\nthat men on both sides have called upon you as the best man to come\r\nforward in this difficulty. Excuse me, my friend, again, if I say\r\nthat I expect to find your manliness equal to your capacity."\r\n\r\n"If I could only escape from it!"\r\n\r\n"Psha;--nonsense!" said the old Duke, getting up. "There is such a\r\nthing as a conscience with so fine an edge that it will allow a man\r\nto do nothing. You\'ve got to serve your country. On such assistance\r\nas I can give you you know that you may depend with absolute\r\nassurance. Now let us get to work. I suppose you would wish that I\r\nshould take the chair at the Council."\r\n\r\n"Certainly;--of course," said the Duke of Omnium, turning to the\r\ntable. The one practical suggestion had fixed him, and from that\r\nmoment he gave himself to the work in hand with all his energies. It\r\nwas not very difficult, nor did it take them a very long time. If the\r\nfuture Prime Minister had not his names at his fingers\' ends, the\r\nfuture President of the Council had them. Eight men were soon named\r\nwhom it was thought well that the Duke of Omnium should consult early\r\nin the morning as to their willingness to fill certain places.\r\n\r\n"Each one of them may have some other one or some two whom he may\r\ninsist on bringing with him," said the elder Duke; "and though of\r\ncourse you cannot yield to the pressure in every such case, it will\r\nbe wise to allow yourself scope for some amount of concession. You\'ll\r\nfind they\'ll shake down after the usual amount of resistance and\r\ncompliance. No;--don\'t you leave your house to-morrow to see anybody\r\nunless it be Mr. Daubeny or her Majesty. I\'ll come to you at two, and\r\nif her Grace will give me luncheon, I\'ll lunch with her. Good night,\r\nand don\'t think too much of the bigness of the thing. I remember dear\r\nold Lord Brock telling me how much more difficult it was to find a\r\ngood coachman than a good Secretary of State." The Duke of Omnium, as\r\nhe sat thinking of things for the next hour in his chair, succeeded\r\nonly in proving to himself that Lord Brock never ought to have been\r\nPrime Minister of England after having ventured to make so poor a\r\njoke on so solemn a subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of a New Career\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time that the Easter holidays were over,--holidays which had\r\nbeen used so conveniently for the making of a new government,--the\r\nwork of getting a team together had been accomplished by the united\r\nenergy of the two dukes and other friends. The filling up of the\r\ngreat places had been by no means so difficult or so tedious,--nor\r\nindeed the cause of half so many heartburns,--as the completion of\r\nthe list of the subordinates. _Noblesse oblige._ The Secretaries of\r\nState, and the Chancellors, and the First Lords, selected from this\r\nor the other party, felt that the eyes of mankind were upon them, and\r\nthat it behoved them to assume a virtue if they had it not. They were\r\nhabitually indifferent to self-exaltation, and allowed themselves\r\nto be thrust into this or that unfitting role, professing that the\r\nQueen\'s Government and the good of the country were their only\r\nconsiderations. Lord Thrift made way for Sir Orlando Drought at the\r\nAdmiralty, because it was felt on all sides that Sir Orlando could\r\nnot join the new composite party without high place. And the same\r\ngrace was shown in regard to Lord Drummond, who remained at the\r\nColonies, keeping the office to which he had been lately transferred\r\nunder Mr. Daubeny. And Sir Gregory Grogram said not a word, whatever\r\nhe may have thought, when he was told that Mr. Daubeny\'s Lord\r\nChancellor, Lord Ramsden, was to keep the seals. Sir Gregory did,\r\nno doubt, think very much about it; for legal offices have a\r\nsignification differing much from that which attaches itself to\r\nplaces simply political. A Lord Chancellor becomes a peer, and on\r\ngoing out of office enjoys a large pension. When the woolsack has\r\nbeen reached there comes an end of doubt, and a beginning of ease.\r\nSir Gregory was not a young man, and this was a terrible blow. But he\r\nbore it manfully, saying not a word when the Duke spoke to him; but\r\nhe became convinced from that moment that no more inefficient lawyer\r\never sat upon the English bench, or a more presumptuous politician in\r\nthe British Parliament, than Lord Ramsden.\r\n\r\nThe real struggle, however, lay in the appropriate distribution of\r\nthe Rattlers and the Robys, the Fitzgibbons and the Macphersons among\r\nthe subordinate offices of State. Mr. Macpherson and Mr. Roby, with\r\na host of others who had belonged to Mr. Daubeny, were prepared, as\r\nthey declared from the first, to lend their assistance to the Duke.\r\nThey had consulted Mr. Daubeny on the subject, and Mr. Daubeny told\r\nthem that their duty lay in that direction. At the first blush of\r\nthe matter the arrangement took the form of a gracious tender from\r\nthemselves to a statesman called upon to act in very difficult\r\ncircumstances,--and they were thanked accordingly by the Duke, with\r\nsomething of real cordial gratitude. But when the actual adjustment\r\nof things was in hand, the Duke, having but little power of assuming\r\na soft countenance and using soft words while his heart was bitter,\r\nfelt on more than one occasion inclined to withdraw his thanks. He\r\nwas astounded not so much by the pretensions as by the unblushing\r\nassertion of these pretensions in reference to places which he had\r\nbeen innocent enough to think were always bestowed at any rate\r\nwithout direct application. He had measured himself rightly when he\r\ntold the older duke in one of those anxious conversations which had\r\nbeen held before the attempt was made, that long as he had been in\r\noffice himself he did not know what was the way of bestowing office.\r\n"Two gentlemen have been here this morning," he said one day to the\r\nDuke of St. Bungay, "one on the heels of the other, each assuring me\r\nnot only that the whole stability of the enterprise depends on my\r\ngiving a certain office to him,--but actually telling me to my face\r\nthat I had promised it to him!" The old statesman laughed. "To be\r\ntold within the same half-hour by two men that I had made promises to\r\neach of them inconsistent with each other!"\r\n\r\n"Who were the two men?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Rattler and Mr. Roby."\r\n\r\n"I am assured that they are inseparable since the work was begun.\r\nThey always had a leaning to each other, and now I hear they pass\r\ntheir time between the steps of the Carlton and Reform Clubs."\r\n\r\n"But what am I to do? One must be Patronage Secretary, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"They\'re both good men in their way, you know."\r\n\r\n"But why do they come to me with their mouths open, like dogs craving\r\na bone? It used not to be so. Of course men were always anxious for\r\noffice as they are now."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes. We\'ve heard of that before to-day, I think."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t think any man ever ventured to ask Mr. Mildmay."\r\n\r\n"Time had done much for him in consolidating his authority, and\r\nperhaps the present world is less reticent in its eagerness than\r\nit was in his younger days. I doubt, however, whether it is more\r\ndishonest, and whether struggles were not made quite as disgraceful\r\nto the strugglers as anything that is done now. You can\'t alter the\r\nmen, and you must use them." The younger Duke sat down and sighed\r\nover the degenerate patriotism of the age.\r\n\r\nBut at last even the Rattlers and Robys were fixed, if not satisfied,\r\nand a complete list of the ministry appeared in all the newspapers.\r\nThough the thing had been long a-doing, still it had come\r\nsuddenly,--so that at the first proposition to form a coalition\r\nministry, the newspapers had hardly known whether to assist or to\r\noppose the scheme. There was no doubt, in the minds of all these\r\neditors and contributors, the teaching of a tradition that coalitions\r\nof this kind have been generally feeble, sometimes disastrous, and\r\non occasions even disgraceful. When a man, perhaps through a long\r\npolitical life, has bound himself to a certain code of opinions, how\r\ncan he change that code at a moment? And when at the same moment,\r\ntogether with the change, he secures power, patronage, and pay, how\r\nshall the public voice absolve him? But then again men, who have\r\nby the work of their lives grown into a certain position in the\r\ncountry, and have unconsciously but not therefore less actually made\r\nthemselves indispensable either to this side in politics or to that,\r\ncannot free themselves altogether from the responsibility of managing\r\nthem when a period comes such as that now reached. This also the\r\nnewspapers perceived; and having, since the commencement of the\r\nSession, been very loud in exposing the disgraceful collapse of\r\ngovernment affairs, could hardly refuse their support to any attempt\r\nat a feasible arrangement. When it was first known that the Duke of\r\nOmnium had consented to make the attempt, they had both on one side\r\nand the other been loud in his praise, going so far as to say that he\r\nwas the only man in England who could do the work. It was probably\r\nthis encouragement which had enabled the new Premier to go on with an\r\nundertaking which was personally distasteful to him, and for which\r\nfrom day to day he believed himself to be less and less fit. But when\r\nthe newspapers told him that he was the only man for the occasion,\r\nhow could he be justified in crediting himself in preference to them?\r\n\r\nThe work in Parliament began under the new auspices with great\r\ntranquillity. That there would soon come causes of hot blood,--the\r\nEnglish Church, the county suffrage, the income tax, and further\r\neducation questions,--all men knew who knew anything. But for the\r\nmoment, for the month even, perhaps for the Session, there was to\r\nbe peace, with full latitude for the performance of routine duties.\r\nThere was so to say no opposition, and at first it seemed that one\r\nspecial bench in the House of Commons would remain unoccupied. But\r\nafter a day or two,--on one of which Mr. Daubeny had been seen\r\nsitting just below the gangway,--that gentleman returned to the place\r\nusually held by the Prime Minister\'s rival, saying with a smile that\r\nit might be for the convenience of the House that the seat should be\r\nutilised. Mr. Gresham at this time had, with declared purpose, asked\r\nand obtained the Speaker\'s leave of absence and was abroad. Who\r\nshould lead the House? That had been a great question, caused by the\r\nfact that the Prime Minister was in the House of Lords;--and what\r\noffice should the Leader hold? Mr. Monk had consented to take the\r\nExchequer, but the right to sit opposite to the Treasury Box and to\r\nconsider himself for the time the principal spirit in that chamber\r\nwas at last assigned to Sir Orlando Drought. "It will never do,"\r\nsaid Mr. Rattler to Mr. Roby. "I don\'t mean to say anything against\r\nDrought, who has always been a very useful man to your party;--but he\r\nlacks something of the position."\r\n\r\n"The fact is," said Roby, "that we\'ve trusted to two men so long that\r\nwe don\'t know how to suppose any one else big enough to fill their\r\nplaces. Monk wouldn\'t have done. The House doesn\'t care about Monk."\r\n\r\n"I always thought it should be Wilson, and so I told the Duke. He had\r\nan idea that it should be one of your men."\r\n\r\n"I think he\'s right there," said Roby. "There ought to be something\r\nlike a fair division. Individuals might be content, but the party\r\nwould be dissatisfied. For myself, I\'d have sooner stayed out as an\r\nindependent member, but Daubeny said that he thought I was bound to\r\nmake myself useful."\r\n\r\n"I told the Duke from the beginning," said Rattler, "that I didn\'t\r\nthink that I could be of any service to him. Of course, I would\r\nsupport him, but I had been too thoroughly a party man for a new\r\nmovement of this kind. But he said just the same!--that he considered\r\nI was bound to join him. I asked Gresham, and when Gresham said so\r\ntoo, of course I had no help for it."\r\n\r\nNeither of these excellent public servants had told a lie in this.\r\nSome such conversations as those reported had passed;--but a man\r\ndoesn\'t lie when he exaggerates an emphasis, or even when he gives\r\nby a tone a meaning to a man\'s words exactly opposite to that which\r\nanother tone would convey. Or, if he does lie in doing so, he does\r\nnot know that he lies. Mr. Rattler had gone back to his old office at\r\nthe Treasury and Mr. Roby had been forced to content himself with the\r\nSecretaryship at the Admiralty. But, as the old Duke had said, they\r\nwere close friends, and prepared to fight together any battle which\r\nmight keep them in their present position.\r\n\r\nMany of the cares of office the Prime Minister did succeed in\r\nshuffling off altogether on to the shoulders of his elder friend.\r\nHe would not concern himself with the appointment of ladies, about\r\nwhom he said he knew nothing, and as to whose fitness and claims he\r\nprofessed himself to be as ignorant as the office messenger. The\r\noffers were of course made in the usual form, as though coming direct\r\nfrom the Queen, through the Prime Minister;--but the selections were\r\nin truth effected by the old Duke in council with--an illustrious\r\npersonage. The matter affected our Duke,--only in so far that he\r\ncould not get out of his mind that strange application from his own\r\nwife. "That she should have even dreamed of it!" he would say to\r\nhimself, not yet having acquired sufficient experience of his fellow\r\ncreatures to be aware how wonderfully temptations will affect even\r\nthose who appear to be least subject to them. The town horse, used to\r\ngaudy trappings, no doubt despises the work of his country brother;\r\nbut yet, now and again, there comes upon him a sudden desire to\r\nplough. The desire for ploughing had come upon the Duchess, but the\r\nDuke could not understand it.\r\n\r\nHe perceived, however, in spite of the multiplicity of his official\r\nwork, that his refusal sat heavily on his wife\'s breast, and that,\r\nthough she spoke no further word, she brooded over her injury. And\r\nhis heart was sad within him when he thought that he had vexed\r\nher,--loving her as he did with all his heart, but with a heart\r\nthat was never demonstrative. When she was unhappy he was miserable,\r\nthough he would hardly know the cause of his misery. Her ridicule and\r\nraillery he could bear, though they stung him; but her sorrow, if\r\never she were sorrowful, or her sullenness, if ever she were sullen,\r\nupset him altogether. He was in truth so soft of heart that he could\r\nnot bear the discomfort of the one person in the world who seemed to\r\nhim to be near to him. He had expressly asked her for her sympathy\r\nin the business he had on hand,--thereby going much beyond his usual\r\ncoldness of manner. She, with an eagerness which might have been\r\nexpected from her, had promised that she would slave for him, if\r\nslavery were necessary. Then she had made her request, had been\r\nrefused, and was now moody. "The Duchess of ---- is to be Mistress\r\nof the Robes," he said to her one day. He had gone to her, up to her\r\nown room, before he dressed for dinner, having devoted much more time\r\nthan as Prime Minister he ought to have done to a resolution that he\r\nwould make things straight with her, and to the best way of doing it.\r\n\r\n"So I am told. She ought to know her way about the place, as I\r\nremember she was at the same work when I was a girl of eleven."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not so very long ago, Cora."\r\n\r\n"Silverbridge is older now than I was then, and I think that makes it\r\na very long time ago." Lord Silverbridge was the Duke\'s eldest son.\r\n\r\n"But what does it matter? If she began her career in the time of\r\nGeorge the Fourth, what is it to you?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth,--only that she did in truth begin her career\r\nin the time of George the Third. I\'m sure she\'s nearer sixty than\r\nfifty."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to see you remember your dates so well."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity she should not remember hers in the way she dresses,"\r\nsaid the Duchess.\r\n\r\nThis was marvellous to him,--that his wife, who as Lady Glencora\r\nPalliser had been so conspicuous for a wild disregard of social rules\r\nas to be looked upon by many as an enemy of her own class, should be\r\nso depressed by not being allowed to be the Queen\'s head servant as\r\nto descend to personal invective! "I\'m afraid," said he, attempting\r\nto smile, "that it won\'t come within the compass of my office to\r\neffect or even to propose any radical change in her Grace\'s apparel.\r\nBut don\'t you think that you and I can afford to ignore all that?"\r\n\r\n"I can certainly. She may be an antiquated Eve for me."\r\n\r\n"I hope, Cora, you are not still disappointed because I did not agree\r\nwith you when you spoke about the place for yourself."\r\n\r\n"Not because you did not agree with me,--but because you did not\r\nthink me fit to be trusted with any judgment of my own. I don\'t know\r\nwhy I\'m always to be looked upon as different from other women,--as\r\nthough I were half a savage."\r\n\r\n"You are what you have made yourself, and I have always rejoiced that\r\nyou are as you are, fresh, untrammelled, without many prejudices\r\nwhich afflict other ladies, and free from bonds by which they are\r\ncramped and confined. Of course such a turn of character is subject\r\nto certain dangers of its own."\r\n\r\n"There is no doubt about the dangers. The chances are that when I see\r\nher Grace I shall tell her what I think about her."\r\n\r\n"You will I am sure say nothing unkind to a lady who is supposed to\r\nbe in the place she now fills by my authority. But do not let us\r\nquarrel about an old woman."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t quarrel with you even about a young one."\r\n\r\n"I cannot be at ease within myself while I think you are resenting my\r\nrefusal. You do not know how constantly I carry you about with me."\r\n\r\n"You carry a very unnecessary burden then," she said. But he could\r\ntell at once from the altered tone of her voice, and from the light\r\nof her eye as he glanced into her face, that her anger about "The\r\nRobes" was appeased.\r\n\r\n"I have done as you asked about a friend of yours," he said. This\r\noccurred just before the final and perfected list of the new men had\r\nappeared in all the newspapers.\r\n\r\n"What friend?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn is to go to Ireland."\r\n\r\n"Go to Ireland!--How do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"It is looked upon as being very great promotion. Indeed I am told\r\nthat he is considered to be the luckiest man in all the scramble."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean as Chief Secretary?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. He certainly couldn\'t go as Lord Lieutenant."\r\n\r\n"But they said that Barrington Erle was going to Ireland."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes. I don\'t know that you\'d be interested by all the ins and\r\nouts of it. But Mr. Erle declined. It seems that Mr. Erle is after\r\nall the one man in Parliament modest enough not to consider himself\r\nto be fit for any place that can be offered to him."\r\n\r\n"Poor Barrington! He does not like the idea of crossing the Channel\r\nso often. I quite sympathise with him. And so Phineas is to be\r\nSecretary for Ireland! Not in the Cabinet?"\r\n\r\n"No;--not in the Cabinet. It is not by any means usual that he should\r\nbe."\r\n\r\n"That is promotion, and I am glad! Poor Phineas! I hope they won\'t\r\nmurder him, or anything of that kind. They do murder people, you\r\nknow, sometimes."\r\n\r\n"He\'s an Irishman himself."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just the reason why they should. He must put up with that of\r\ncourse. I wonder whether she\'ll like going. They\'ll be able to spend\r\nmoney, which they always like, over there. He comes backwards and\r\nforwards every week,--doesn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite that, I believe."\r\n\r\n"I shall miss her, if she has to stay away long. I know you don\'t\r\nlike her."\r\n\r\n"I do like her. She has always behaved well, both to me and to my\r\nuncle."\r\n\r\n"She was an angel to him,--and to you too, if you only knew it. I\r\ndare say you\'re sending him to Ireland so as to get her away from\r\nme." This she said with a smile, as though not meaning it altogether,\r\nbut yet half meaning it.\r\n\r\n"I have asked him to undertake the office," said the Duke solemnly,\r\n"because I am told that he is fit for it. But I did have some\r\npleasure in proposing it to him because I thought that it would\r\nplease you."\r\n\r\n"It does please me, and I won\'t be cross any more, and the Duchess\r\nof ---- may wear her clothes just as she pleases, or go without them.\r\nAnd as for Mrs. Finn, I don\'t see why she should be with him always\r\nwhen he goes. You can quite understand how necessary she is to me.\r\nBut she is in truth the only woman in London to whom I can say what I\r\nthink. And it is a comfort, you know, to have some one."\r\n\r\nIn this way the domestic peace of the Prime Minister was readjusted,\r\nand that sympathy and co-operation for which he had first asked\r\nwas accorded to him. It may be a question whether on the whole the\r\nDuchess did not work harder than he did. She did not at first dare to\r\nexpound to him those grand ideas which she had conceived in regard to\r\nmagnificence and hospitality. She said nothing of any extraordinary\r\nexpenditure of money. But she set herself to work after her own\r\nfashion, making to him suggestions as to dinners and evening\r\nreceptions, to which he objected only on the score of time. "You must\r\neat your dinner somewhere," she said, "and you need only come in just\r\nbefore we sit down, and go into your own room if you please without\r\ncoming upstairs at all. I can at any rate do that part of it for\r\nyou." And she did do that part of it with marvellous energy all\r\nthrough the month of May,--so that by the end of the month, within\r\nsix weeks of the time at which she first heard of the Coalition\r\nMinistry, all the world had begun to talk of the Prime Minister\'s\r\ndinners, and of the receptions given by the Prime Minister\'s wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMrs. Dick\'s Dinner Party.--No. I\r\n\r\n\r\nOur readers must not forget the troubles of poor Emily Wharton\r\namidst the gorgeous festivities of the new Prime Minister. Throughout\r\nApril and May she did not see Ferdinand Lopez. It may be remembered\r\nthat on the night when the matter was discussed between her and\r\nher father, she promised him that she would not do so without his\r\npermission,--saying, however, at the same time very openly that her\r\nhappiness depended on such permission being given to her. For two or\r\nthree weeks not a word further was said between her and her father on\r\nthe subject, and he had endeavoured to banish the subject from his\r\nmind,--feeling no doubt that if nothing further were ever said it\r\nwould be so much the better. But then his daughter referred to the\r\nmatter,--very plainly, with a simple question, and without disguise\r\nof her own feeling, but still in a manner which he could not bring\r\nhimself to rebuke. "Aunt Harriet has asked me once or twice to go\r\nthere of an evening, when you have been out. I have declined because\r\nI thought Mr. Lopez would be there. Must I tell her that I am not to\r\nmeet Mr. Lopez, papa?"\r\n\r\n"If she has him there on purpose to throw him in your way, I shall\r\nthink very badly of her."\r\n\r\n"But he has been in the habit of being there, papa. Of course if you\r\nare decided about this, it is better that I should not see him."\r\n\r\n"Did I not tell you that I was decided?"\r\n\r\n"You said you would make some further inquiry and speak to me again."\r\nNow Mr. Wharton had made inquiry, but had learned nothing to reassure\r\nhimself;--neither had he been able to learn any fact, putting his\r\nfinger on which he could point out to his daughter clearly that\r\nthe marriage would be unsuitable for her. Of the man\'s ability and\r\nposition, as certainly also of his manners, the world at large seemed\r\nto speak well. He had been blackballed at two clubs, but apparently\r\nwithout any defined reason. He lived as though he possessed a\r\nhandsome income, and yet was in no degree fast or flashy. He was\r\nsupposed to be an intimate friend of Mr. Mills Happerton, one of\r\nthe partners in the world-famous commercial house of Hunky and Sons,\r\nwhich dealt in millions. Indeed there had been at one time a rumour\r\nthat he was going to be taken into the house of Hunky and Sons as a\r\njunior partner. It was evident that many people had been favourably\r\nimpressed by his outward demeanour, by his mode of talk, and by his\r\nway of living. But no one knew anything about him. With regard to his\r\nmaterial position Mr. Wharton could of course ask direct questions if\r\nhe pleased, and require evidence as to alleged property. But he felt\r\nthat by doing so he would abandon his right to object to the man as\r\nbeing a Portuguese stranger, and he did not wish to have Ferdinand\r\nLopez as a son-in-law, even though he should be a partner in Hunky\r\nand Sons, and able to maintain a gorgeous palace at South Kensington.\r\n\r\n"I have made inquiry."\r\n\r\n"Well, papa?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about him. Nobody knows anything about him."\r\n\r\n"Could you not ask himself anything you want to know? If I might see\r\nhim I would ask him."\r\n\r\n"That would not do at all."\r\n\r\n"It comes to this, papa, that I am to sever myself from a man to whom\r\nI am attached, and whom you must admit that I have been allowed to\r\nmeet from day to day with no caution that his intimacy was unpleasant\r\nto you, because he is called--Lopez."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that at all. There are English people of that name; but he\r\nisn\'t an Englishman."\r\n\r\n"Of course, if you say so, papa, it must be so. I have told Aunt\r\nHarriet that I consider myself to be prohibited from meeting\r\nMr. Lopez by what you have said; but I think, papa, you are a\r\nlittle--cruel to me."\r\n\r\n"Cruel to you!" said Mr. Wharton, almost bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n"I am as ready to obey as a child;--but, not being a child, I think\r\nI ought to have a reason." To this Mr. Wharton made no further\r\nimmediate answer, but pulled his hair, and shuffled his feet about,\r\nand then escaped out of the room.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards his sister-in-law attacked him. "Are we to\r\nunderstand, Mr. Wharton, that Emily is not to meet Mr. Lopez again?\r\nIt makes it very unpleasant, because he has been intimate at our\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"I never said a word about her not meeting him. Of course I do not\r\nwish that any meeting should be contrived between them."\r\n\r\n"As it stands now it is prejudicial to her. Of course it cannot but\r\nbe observed, and it is so odd that a young lady should be forbidden\r\nto meet a certain man. It looks so unpleasant for her,--as though she\r\nhad misbehaved herself."\r\n\r\n"I have never thought so for a moment."\r\n\r\n"Of course you have not. How could you have thought so, Mr. Wharton?"\r\n\r\n"I say that I never did."\r\n\r\n"What must he think when he knows,--as of course he does know,--that\r\nshe has been forbidden to meet him? It must make him fancy that he is\r\nmade very much of. All that is so very bad for a girl! Indeed it is,\r\nMr. Wharton." Of course there was absolute dishonesty in all this on\r\nthe part of Mrs. Roby. She was true enough to Emily\'s lover,--too\r\ntrue to him; but she was false to Emily\'s father. If Emily would\r\nhave yielded to her she would have arranged meetings at her own\r\nhouse between the lovers altogether in opposition to the father.\r\nNevertheless there was a show of reason about what she said which\r\nMr. Wharton was unable to overcome. And at the same time there was\r\na reality about his girl\'s sorrow which overcame him. He had never\r\nhitherto consulted any one about anything in his family, having\r\nalways found his own information and intellect sufficient for his own\r\naffairs. But now he felt grievously in want of some pillar,--some\r\nfemale pillar,--on which he could lean. He did not know all Mrs.\r\nRoby\'s iniquities; but still he felt that she was not the pillar\r\nof which he was in need. There was no such pillar for his use, and\r\nhe was driven to acknowledge to himself that in this distressing\r\nposition he must be guided by his own strength, and his own lights.\r\nHe thought it all out as well as he could in his own chamber,\r\nallowing his book or his brief to lie idle beside him for many a\r\nhalf-hour. But he was much puzzled both as to the extent of his own\r\nauthority and the manner in which it should be used. He certainly had\r\nnot desired his daughter not to meet the man. He could understand\r\nthat unless some affront had been offered such an edict enforced as\r\nto the conduct of a young lady would induce all her acquaintance to\r\nsuppose that she was either very much in love or else very prone to\r\nmisbehave herself. He feared, indeed, that she was very much in love,\r\nbut it would not be prudent to tell her secret to all the world.\r\nPerhaps it would be better that she should meet him,--always with\r\nthe understanding that she was not to accept from him any peculiar\r\nattention. If she would be obedient in one particular, she would\r\nprobably be so in the other;--and, indeed, he did not at all doubt\r\nher obedience. She would obey, but would take care to show him that\r\nshe was made miserable by obeying. He began to foresee that he had a\r\nbad time before him.\r\n\r\nAnd then as he still sat idle, thinking of it all, his mind wandered\r\noff to another view of the subject. Could he be happy, or even\r\ncomfortable, if she were unhappy? Of course he endeavoured to\r\nconvince himself that if he were bold, determined, and dictatorial\r\nwith her, it would only be in order that her future happiness might\r\nbe secured. A parent is often bound to disregard the immediate\r\ncomfort of a child. But then was he sure that he was right? He of\r\ncourse had his own way of looking at life, but was it reasonable that\r\nhe should force his girl to look at things with his eyes? The man was\r\ndistasteful to him as being unlike his idea of an English gentleman,\r\nand as being without those far-reaching fibres and roots by which he\r\nthought that the solidity and stability of a human tree should be\r\nassured. But the world was changing around him every day. Royalty was\r\nmarrying out of its degree. Peers\' sons were looking only for money.\r\nAnd, more than that, peers\' daughters were bestowing themselves on\r\nJews and shopkeepers. Had he not better make the usual inquiry about\r\nthe man\'s means, and, if satisfied on that head, let the girl do as\r\nshe would? Added to all this there was growing on him a feeling that\r\nultimately youth would as usual triumph over age, and that he would\r\nbe beaten. If that were so, why worry himself, or why worry her?\r\n\r\nOn the day after Mrs. Roby\'s attack upon him he again saw that lady,\r\nhaving on this occasion sent round to ask her to come to him. "I want\r\nyou to understand that I put no embargo on Emily as to meeting Mr.\r\nLopez. I can trust her fully. I do not wish her to encourage his\r\nattentions, but I by no means wish her to avoid him."\r\n\r\n"Am I to tell Emily what you say?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell her myself. I think it better to say as much to you, as\r\nyou seemed to be embarrassed by the fear that they might happen to\r\nsee each other in your drawing-room."\r\n\r\n"It was rather awkward;--wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I have spoken now because you seemed to think so." His manner to her\r\nwas not very pleasant, but Mrs. Roby had known him for many years,\r\nand did not care very much for his manner. She had an object to gain,\r\nand could put up with a good deal for the sake of her object.\r\n\r\n"Very well. Then I shall know how to act. But, Mr. Wharton, I must\r\nsay this, you know Emily has a will of her own, and you must not hold\r\nme responsible for anything that may occur." As soon as he heard this\r\nhe almost resolved to withdraw the concession he had made;--but he\r\ndid not do so.\r\n\r\nVery soon after this there came a special invitation from Mr. and\r\nMrs. Roby, asking the Whartons, father and daughter, to dine with\r\nthem round the corner. It was quite a special invitation, because\r\nit came in the form of a card,--which was unusual between the\r\ntwo families. But the dinner was too, in some degree, a special\r\ndinner,--as Emily was enabled to explain to her father, the whole\r\nspeciality having been fully detailed to herself by her aunt. Mr.\r\nRoby, whose belongings were not generally aristocratic, had one great\r\nconnexion with whom, after many years of quarrelling, he had lately\r\ncome into amity. This was his half-brother, considerably older than\r\nhimself, and was no other than that Mr. Roby who was now Secretary to\r\nthe Admiralty, and who in the last Conservative Government had been\r\none of the Secretaries to the Treasury. The oldest Mr. Roby of all,\r\nnow long since gathered to his fathers, had had two wives and two\r\nsons. The elder son had not been left as well off as friends, or\r\nperhaps as he himself, could have wished. But he had risen in the\r\nworld by his wits, had made his way into Parliament, and had become,\r\nas all readers of these chronicles know, a staff of great strength to\r\nhis party. But he had always been a poor man. His periods of office\r\nhad been much shorter than those of his friend Rattler, and his other\r\nsources of income had not been certain. His younger half-brother,\r\nwho, as far as the great world was concerned, had none of his elder\r\nbrother\'s advantages, had been endowed with some fortune from his\r\nmother, and,--in an evil hour for both of them,--had lent the\r\npolitician money. As one consequence of this transaction, they had\r\nnot spoken to each other for years. On this quarrel Mrs. Roby was\r\nalways harping with her own husband,--not taking his part. Her Roby,\r\nher Dick, had indeed the means of supporting her with a fair comfort,\r\nbut had, of his own, no power of introducing her to that sort of\r\nsociety for which her soul craved. But Mr. Thomas Roby was a great\r\nman,--though unfortunately poor,--and moved in high circles. Because\r\nthey had lent their money,--which no doubt was lost for ever,--why\r\nshould they also lose the advantages of such a connexion? Would it\r\nnot be wiser rather to take the debt as a basis whereon to found\r\na claim for special fraternal observation and kindred social\r\nintercourse? Dick, who was fond of his money, would not for a long\r\ntime look at the matter in this light, but harassed his brother from\r\ntime to time by applications which were quite useless, and which by\r\nthe acerbity of their language altogether shut Mrs. Roby out from the\r\ngood things which might have accrued to her from so distinguished\r\na brother-in-law. But when it came to pass that Thomas Roby was\r\nconfirmed in office by the coalition which has been mentioned, Mrs.\r\nDick became very energetic. She went herself to the official hero\r\nand told him how desirous she was of peace. Nothing more should be\r\nsaid about the money,--at any rate for the present. Let brothers be\r\nbrothers. And so it came to pass that the Secretary to the Admiralty\r\nwith his wife were to dine in Berkeley Street, and that Mr. Wharton\r\nwas asked to meet them.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t particularly want to meet Mr. Thomas Roby," the old\r\nbarrister said.\r\n\r\n"They want you to come," said Emily, "because there has been some\r\nfamily reconciliation. You usually do go once or twice a year."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it may as well be done," said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"I think, papa, that they mean to ask Mr. Lopez," said Emily\r\ndemurely.\r\n\r\n"I told you before that I don\'t want to have you banished from your\r\naunt\'s home by any man," said the father. So the matter was settled,\r\nand the invitation was accepted. This was just at the end of May,\r\nat which time people were beginning to say that the coalition was\r\na success, and some wise men to predict that at last fortuitous\r\nparliamentary atoms had so come together by accidental connexion,\r\nthat a ministry had been formed which might endure for a dozen years.\r\nIndeed there was no reason why there should be any end to a ministry\r\nbuilt on such a foundation. Of course this was very comfortable to\r\nsuch men as Mr. Roby, so that the Admiralty Secretary when he entered\r\nhis sister-in-law\'s drawing-room was suffused with that rosy hue of\r\nhuman bliss which a feeling of triumph bestows. "Yes," said he, in\r\nanswer to some would-be facetious remark from his brother, "I think\r\nwe have weathered that storm pretty well. It does seem rather odd, my\r\nsitting cheek by jowl with Mr. Monk and gentlemen of that kidney; but\r\nthey don\'t bite. I\'ve got one of our own set at the head of our own\r\noffice, and he leads the House. I think upon the whole we\'ve got a\r\nlittle the best of it." This was listened to by Mr. Wharton with\r\ngreat disgust,--for Mr. Wharton was a Tory of the old school, who\r\nhated compromises, and abhorred in his heart the class of politicians\r\nto whom politics were a profession rather than a creed.\r\n\r\nMr. Roby senior, having escaped from the House, was of course\r\nthe last, and had indeed kept all the other guests waiting\r\nhalf-an-hour,--as becomes a parliamentary magnate in the heat of the\r\nSession. Mr. Wharton, who had been early, saw all the other guests\r\narrive, and among them Mr. Ferdinand Lopez. There was also Mr. Mills\r\nHapperton,--partner in Hunky and Sons,--with his wife, respecting\r\nwhom Mr. Wharton at once concluded that he was there as being the\r\nfriend of Ferdinand Lopez. If so, how much influence must Ferdinand\r\nLopez have in that house! Nevertheless, Mr. Mills Happerton was in\r\nhis way a great man, and a credit to Mrs. Roby. And there were Sir\r\nDamask and Lady Monogram, who were people moving quite in the first\r\ncircles. Sir Damask shot pigeons, and so did also Dick Roby,--whence\r\nhad perhaps arisen an intimacy. But Lady Monogram was not at all a\r\nperson to dine with Mrs. Dick Roby without other cause than this. But\r\na great official among one\'s acquaintance can do so much for one! It\r\nwas probable that Lady Monogram\'s presence was among the first fruits\r\nof the happy family reconciliation that had taken place. Then there\r\nwas Mrs. Leslie, a pretty widow, rather poor, who was glad to receive\r\ncivilities from Mrs. Roby, and was Emily Wharton\'s pet aversion. Mrs.\r\nLeslie had said impertinent things to her about Ferdinand Lopez, and\r\nshe had snubbed Mrs. Leslie. But Mrs. Leslie was serviceable to Mrs.\r\nRoby, and had now been asked to her great dinner party.\r\n\r\nBut the two most illustrious guests have not yet been mentioned. Mrs.\r\nRoby had secured a lord,--an absolute peer of Parliament! This was\r\nno less a man than Lord Mongrober, whose father had been a great\r\njudge in the early part of the century, and had been made a peer.\r\nThe Mongrober estates were not supposed to be large, nor was the\r\nMongrober influence at this time extensive. But this nobleman was\r\nseen about a good deal in society when the dinners given were\r\nsupposed to be worth eating. He was a fat, silent, red-faced, elderly\r\ngentleman, who said very little, and who when he did speak seemed\r\nalways to be in an ill-humour. He would now and then make ill-natured\r\nremarks about his friends\' wines, as suggesting \'68 when a man would\r\nboast of his \'48 claret; and when costly dainties were supplied for\r\nhis use, would remark that such and such a dish was very well at some\r\nother time of the year. So that ladies attentive to their tables and\r\nhosts proud of their cellars would almost shake in their shoes before\r\nLord Mongrober. And it may also be said that Lord Mongrober never\r\ngave any chance of retaliation by return dinners. There lived not the\r\nman or woman who had dined with Lord Mongrober. But yet the Robys of\r\nLondon were glad to entertain him; and the Mrs. Robys, when he was\r\ncoming, would urge their cooks to superhuman energies by the mention\r\nof his name.\r\n\r\nAnd there was Lady Eustace! Of Lady Eustace it was impossible to say\r\nwhether her beauty, her wit, her wealth, or the remarkable history of\r\nher past life, most recommended her to such hosts and hostesses as\r\nMr. and Mrs. Roby. As her history may be already known to some, no\r\ndetails of it shall be repeated here. At this moment she was free\r\nfrom all marital persecution, and was very much run after by a\r\ncertain set in society. There were others again who declared that no\r\ndecent man or woman ought to meet her. On the score of lovers there\r\nwas really little or nothing to be said against her; but she had\r\nimplicated herself in an unfortunate second marriage, and then there\r\nwas that old story about the jewels! But there was no doubt about her\r\nmoney and her good looks, and some considered her to be clever. These\r\ncompleted the list of Mrs. Roby\'s great dinner party.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton, who had arrived early, could not but take notice that\r\nLopez, who soon followed him into the room, had at once fallen\r\ninto conversation with Emily, as though there had never been any\r\ndifficulty in the matter. The father, standing on the rug and\r\npretending to answer the remarks made to him by Dick Roby, could see\r\nthat Emily said but little. The man, however, was so much at his ease\r\nthat there was no necessity for her to exert herself. Mr. Wharton\r\nhated him for being at his ease. Had he appeared to have been\r\nrebuffed by the circumstances of his position the prejudices of\r\nthe old man would have been lessened. By degrees the guests came.\r\nLord Mongrober stood also on the rug, dumb, with a look of intense\r\nimpatience for his food, hardly ever condescending to answer the\r\nlittle attempts at conversation made by Mrs. Dick. Lady Eustace\r\ngushed into the room, kissing Mrs. Dick and afterwards kissing her\r\ngreat friend of the moment, Mrs. Leslie, who followed. She then\r\nlooked as though she meant to kiss Lord Mongrober, whom she playfully\r\nand almost familiarly addressed. But Lord Mongrober only grunted.\r\nThen came Sir Damask and Lady Monogram, and Dick at once began about\r\nhis pigeons. Sir Damask, who was the most good-natured man in the\r\nworld, interested himself at once and became energetic; but Lady\r\nMonogram looked round the room carefully, and seeing Lady Eustace,\r\nturned up her nose, nor did she care much for meeting Lord Mongrober.\r\nIf she had been taken in as to the Admiralty Robys, then would she\r\nlet the junior Robys know what she thought about it. Mills Happerton,\r\nwith his wife, caused the frown on Lady Monogram\'s brow to loosen\r\nitself a little, for, so great was the wealth and power of the house\r\nof Hunky and Sons, that Mr. Mills Happerton was no doubt a feature at\r\nany dinner party. Then came the Admiralty Secretary with his wife,\r\nand the order for dinner was given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMrs. Dick\'s Dinner Party.--No. II\r\n\r\n\r\nDick walked downstairs with Lady Monogram. There had been some doubt\r\nwhether of right he should not have taken Lady Eustace, but it was\r\nheld by Mrs. Dick that her ladyship had somewhat impaired her rights\r\nby the eccentricities of her career, and also that she would amiably\r\npardon any little wrong against her of that kind,--whereas Lady\r\nMonogram was a person to be much considered. Then followed Sir Damask\r\nwith Lady Eustace. They seemed to be paired so well together that\r\nthere could be no doubt about them. The ministerial Roby, who was\r\nreally the hero of the night, took Mrs. Happerton, and our friend Mr.\r\nWharton took the Secretary\'s wife. All that had been easy,--so easy\r\nthat fate had good-naturedly arranged things which are sometimes\r\ndifficult of management. But then there came an embarrassment. Of\r\ncourse it would in a usual way be right that a married man as was Mr.\r\nHapperton should be assigned to the widow Mrs. Leslie, and that the\r\nonly two "young" people,--in the usual sense of the word,--should\r\ngo down to dinner together. But Mrs. Roby was at first afraid of Mr.\r\nWharton, and planned it otherwise. When, however, the last moment\r\ncame she plucked up courage, gave Mrs. Leslie to the great commercial\r\nman, and with a brave smile asked Lopez to give his arm to the lady\r\nhe loved. It is sometimes so hard to manage these "little things,"\r\nsaid she to Lord Mongrober as she put her hand upon his arm. His\r\nlordship had been kept standing in that odious drawing-room for\r\nmore than half-an-hour waiting for a man whom he regarded as a poor\r\nTreasury hack, and was by no means in a good humour. Dick Roby\'s wine\r\nwas no doubt good, but he was not prepared to purchase it at such a\r\nprice as this. "Things always get confused when you have waited an\r\nhour for any one," he said. "What can one do, you know, when the\r\nHouse is sitting?" said the lady apologetically. "Of course you\r\nlords can get away, but then you have nothing to do." Lord Mongrober\r\ngrunted, meaning to imply by his grunt that any one would be very\r\nmuch mistaken who supposed that he had any work to do because he was\r\na peer of Parliament.\r\n\r\nLopez and Emily were seated next to each other, and immediately\r\nopposite to them was Mr. Wharton. Certainly nothing fraudulent had\r\nbeen intended on this occasion,--or it would have been arranged that\r\nthe father should sit on the same side of the table with the lover,\r\nso that he should see nothing of what was going on. But it seemed\r\nto Mr. Wharton as though he had been positively swindled by his\r\nsister-in-law. There they sat opposite to him, talking to each other\r\napparently with thoroughly mutual confidence, the very two persons\r\nwhom he most especially desired to keep apart. He had not a word to\r\nsay to either of the ladies near him. He endeavoured to keep his eyes\r\naway from his daughter as much as possible, and to divert his ears\r\nfrom their conversation;--but he could not but look and he could\r\nnot but listen. Not that he really heard a sentence. Emily\'s voice\r\nhardly reached him, and Lopez understood the game he was playing much\r\ntoo well to allow his voice to travel. And he looked as though his\r\nposition were the most commonplace in the world, and as though he had\r\nnothing of more than ordinary interest to say to his neighbour. Mr.\r\nWharton, as he sat there, almost made up his mind that he would leave\r\nhis practice, give up his chambers, abandon even his club, and take\r\nhis daughter at once to--to;--it did not matter where, so that the\r\nplace should be very distant from Manchester Square. There could be\r\nno other remedy for this evil.\r\n\r\nLopez, though he talked throughout the whole of dinner,--turning\r\nsometimes indeed to Mrs. Leslie who sat at his left hand,--said very\r\nlittle that all the world might not have heard. But he did say one\r\nsuch word. "It has been so dreary to me, the last month!" Emily of\r\ncourse had no answer to make to this. She could not tell him that\r\nher desolation had been infinitely worse than his, and that she\r\nhad sometimes felt as though her very heart would break. "I wonder\r\nwhether it must always be like this with me," he said,--and then he\r\nwent back to the theatres, and other ordinary conversation.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'ve got to the bottom of that champagne you used\r\nto have," said Lord Mongrober, roaring across the table to his\r\nhost, holding his glass in his hand, and with strong marks of\r\ndisapprobation on his face.\r\n\r\n"The very same wine as we were drinking when your lordship last did\r\nme the honour of dining here," said Dick. Lord Mongrober raised his\r\neyebrows, shook his head and put down the glass.\r\n\r\n"Shall we try another bottle?" asked Mrs. Dick with solicitude.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no;--it\'d be all the same, I know. I\'ll just take a little dry\r\nsherry if you have it." The man came with the decanter. "No, dry\r\nsherry;--dry sherry," said his lordship. The man was confounded,\r\nMrs. Dick was at her wits\' ends, and everything was in confusion.\r\nLord Mongrober was not the man to be kept waiting by a government\r\nsubordinate without exacting some penalty for such ill-treatment.\r\n\r\n"\'Is lordship is a little out of sorts," whispered Dick to Lady\r\nMonogram.\r\n\r\n"Very much out of sorts, it seems."\r\n\r\n"And the worst of it is, there isn\'t a better glass of wine in\r\nLondon, and \'is lordship knows it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that\'s what he comes for," said Lady Monogram, being quite\r\nas uncivil in her way as the nobleman.\r\n\r\n"\'E\'s like a good many others. He knows where he can get a good\r\ndinner. After all, there\'s no attraction like that. Of course, a\r\n\'ansome woman won\'t admit that, Lady Monogram."\r\n\r\n"I will not admit it, at any rate, Mr. Roby."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t doubt Monogram is as careful as any one else to get the\r\nbest cook he can, and takes a good deal of trouble about his wine\r\ntoo. Mongrober is very unfair about that champagne. It came out\r\nof Madame Cliquot\'s cellars before the war, and I gave Sprott and\r\nBurlinghammer 110s. for it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there are a dozen men in London can give you such a\r\nglass of wine as that. What do you say about that champagne,\r\nMonogram?"\r\n\r\n"Very tidy wine," said Sir Damask.\r\n\r\n"I should think it is. I gave 110s. for it before the war. \'Is\r\nlordship\'s got a fit of the gout coming, I suppose."\r\n\r\nBut Sir Damask was engaged with his neighbour, Lady Eustace. "Of all\r\nthings I should so like to see a pigeon match," said Lady Eustace.\r\n"I have heard about them all my life. Only I suppose it isn\'t quite\r\nproper for a lady."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, yes."\r\n\r\n"The darling little pigeons! They do sometimes escape, don\'t they?\r\nI hope they escape sometimes. I\'ll go any day you\'ll make up a\r\nparty,--if Lady Monogram will join us." Sir Damask said that he would\r\narrange it, making up his mind, however, at the same time, that this\r\nlast stipulation, if insisted on, would make the thing impracticable.\r\n\r\nRoby the ministerialist, sitting at the end of the table between his\r\nsister-in-law and Mrs. Happerton, was very confidential respecting\r\nthe Government and parliamentary affairs in general. "Yes,\r\nindeed;--of course it\'s a coalition, but I don\'t see why we shouldn\'t\r\ngo on very well. As to the Duke, I\'ve always had the greatest\r\npossible respect for him. The truth is, there\'s nothing special to be\r\ndone at the present moment, and there\'s no reason why we shouldn\'t\r\nagree and divide the good things between us. The Duke has got some\r\ncraze of his own about decimal coinage. He\'ll amuse himself with\r\nthat; but it won\'t come to anything, and it won\'t hurt us."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t the Duchess giving a great many parties?" asked Mrs.\r\nHapperton.\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes. That kind of thing used to be done in old Lady Brock\'s\r\ntime, and the Duchess is repeating it. There\'s no end to their money,\r\nyou know. But it\'s rather a bore for the persons who have to go."\r\nThe ministerial Roby knew well how he would make his sister-in-law\'s\r\nmouth water by such an allusion as this to the great privilege of\r\nentering the Prime Minister\'s mansion in Carlton Terrace.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you in the Government are always asked."\r\n\r\n"We are expected to go too, and are watched pretty close. Lady Glen,\r\nas we used to call her, has the eyes of Argus. And of course we\r\nwho used to be on the other side are especially bound to pay her\r\nobservance."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you like the Duchess?" asked Mrs. Happerton.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--I like her very well. She\'s mad, you know,--mad as a\r\nhatter,--and no one can ever guess what freak may come next. One\r\nalways feels that she\'ll do something sooner or later that will\r\nstartle all the world."\r\n\r\n"There was a queer story once,--wasn\'t there?" asked Mrs. Dick.\r\n\r\n"I never quite believed that," said Roby. "It was something\r\nabout some lover she had before she was married. She went off to\r\nSwitzerland. But the Duke,--he was Mr. Palliser then,--followed her\r\nvery soon and it all came right."\r\n\r\n"When ladies are going to be duchesses, things do come right; don\'t\r\nthey?" said Mrs. Happerton.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of Mrs. Happerton was Mr. Wharton, quite unable to\r\ntalk to his right-hand neighbour, the Secretary\'s wife. The elder\r\nMrs. Roby had not, indeed, much to say for herself, and he during\r\nthe whole dinner was in misery. He had resolved that there should\r\nbe no intimacy of any kind between his daughter and Ferdinand\r\nLopez,--nothing more than the merest acquaintance; and there they\r\nwere, talking together before his very eyes, with more evident signs\r\nof understanding each other than were exhibited by any other two\r\npersons at the table. And yet he had no just ground of complaint\r\nagainst either of them. If people dine together at the same house,\r\nit may of course happen that they shall sit next to each other. And\r\nif people sit next to each other at dinner, it is expected that they\r\nshall talk. Nobody could accuse Emily of flirting; but then she was\r\na girl who under no circumstances would condescend to flirt. But she\r\nhad declared boldly to her father that she loved this man, and there\r\nshe was in close conversation with him! Would it not be better for\r\nhim to give up any further trouble, and let her marry the man? She\r\nwould certainly do so sooner or later.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies went upstairs that misery was over for a time, but\r\nMr. Wharton was still not happy. Dick came round and took his wife\'s\r\nchair, so that he sat between the lord and his brother. Lopez and\r\nHapperton fell into city conversation, and Sir Damask tried to amuse\r\nhimself with Mr. Wharton. But the task was hopeless,--as it always\r\nis when the elements of a party have been ill-mixed. Mr. Wharton had\r\nnot even heard of the new Aldershot coach which Sir Damask had just\r\nstarted with Colonel Buskin and Sir Alfonso Blackbird. And when Sir\r\nDamask declared that he drove the coach up and down twice a week\r\nhimself, Mr. Wharton at any rate affected to believe that such a\r\nthing was impossible. Then when Sir Damask gave his opinion as to the\r\ncause of the failure of a certain horse at Northampton, Mr. Wharton\r\ngave him no encouragement whatever. "I never was at a racecourse in\r\nmy life," said the barrister. After that Sir Damask drank his wine in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"You remember that claret, my lord?" said Dick, thinking that some\r\nlittle compensation was due to him for what had been said about the\r\nchampagne.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Mongrober\'s dinner had not yet had the effect of mollifying\r\nthe man sufficiently for Dick\'s purposes. "Oh, yes, I remember the\r\nwine. You call it \'57, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"And it is \'57;--\'57, Leoville."\r\n\r\n"Very likely,--very likely. If it hadn\'t been heated before the\r\nfire--"\r\n\r\n"It hasn\'t been near the fire," said Dick.\r\n\r\n"Or put into a hot decanter--"\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the kind."\r\n\r\n"Or treated after some other damnable fashion, it would be very good\r\nwine, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"You are hard to please, my lord, to-day," said Dick, who was put\r\nbeyond his bearing.\r\n\r\n"What is a man to say? If you will talk about your wine, I can only\r\ntell you what I think. Any man may get good wine,--that is if he can\r\nafford to pay the price,--but it isn\'t one out of ten who knows how\r\nto put it on the table." Dick felt this to be very hard. When a man\r\npays 110s. a dozen for his champagne, and then gives it to guests\r\nlike Lord Mongrober who are not even expected to return the favour,\r\nthen that man ought to be allowed to talk about his wine without\r\nfear of rebuke. One doesn\'t have an agreement to that effect written\r\ndown on parchment and sealed; but it is as well understood and ought\r\nto be as faithfully kept as any legal contract. Dick, who could on\r\noccasions be awakened to a touch of manliness, gave the bottle a\r\nshove and threw himself back in his chair. "If you ask me, I can only\r\ntell you," repeated Lord Mongrober.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe you ever had a bottle of wine put before you in\r\nbetter order in all your life," said Dick. His lordship\'s face became\r\nvery square and very red as he looked round at his host. "And as\r\nfor talking about my wine, of course I talk to a man about what he\r\nunderstands. I talk to Monogram about pigeons, to Tom there about\r\npolitics, to Apperton and Lopez about the price of consols, and to\r\nyou about wine. If I asked you what you thought of the last new book,\r\nyour lordship would be a little surprised." Lord Mongrober grunted\r\nand looked redder and squarer than ever; but he made no attempt at\r\nreply, and the victory was evidently left with Dick,--very much to\r\nthe general exaltation of his character. And he was proud of himself.\r\n"We had a little tiff, me and Mongrober," he said to his wife that\r\nnight. "\'E\'s a very good fellow, and of course he\'s a lord and all\r\nthat. But he has to be put down occasionally, and, by George, I did\r\nit to-night. You ask Lopez."\r\n\r\nThere were two drawing-rooms up-stairs, opening into each other, but\r\nstill distinct. Emily had escaped into the back room, avoiding the\r\ngushing sentiments and equivocal morals of Lady Eustace and Mrs.\r\nLeslie,--and here she was followed by Ferdinand Lopez. Mr. Wharton\r\nwas in the front room, and though on entering it he did look round\r\nfurtively for his daughter, he was ashamed to wander about in\r\norder that he might watch her. And there were others in the back\r\nroom,--Dick and Monogram standing on the rug, and the elder Mrs.\r\nRoby seated in a corner;--so that there was nothing peculiar in the\r\nposition of the two lovers.\r\n\r\n"Must I understand," said he, "that I am banished from Manchester\r\nSquare?"\r\n\r\n"Has papa banished you?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I want you to tell me."\r\n\r\n"I know you had an interview with him, Mr. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I had."\r\n\r\n"And you must know best what he told you."\r\n\r\n"He would explain himself better to you than he did to me."\r\n\r\n"I doubt that very much. Papa, when he has anything to say, generally\r\nsays it plainly. However, I do think that he did intend to banish\r\nyou. I do not know why I should not tell you the truth."\r\n\r\n"I do not know either."\r\n\r\n"I think he did--intend to banish you."\r\n\r\n"And you?"\r\n\r\n"I shall be guided by him in all things,--as far as I can."\r\n\r\n"Then I am banished by you also?"\r\n\r\n"I did not say so. But if papa says that you are not to come there,\r\nof course I cannot ask you to do so."\r\n\r\n"But I may see you here?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lopez, I will not be asked some questions. I will not indeed."\r\n\r\n"You know why I ask them. You know that to me you are more than all\r\nthe world." She stood still for a moment after hearing this, and then\r\nwithout any reply walked away into the other room. She felt half\r\nashamed of herself in that she had not rebuked him for speaking to\r\nher in that fashion after his interview with her father, and yet his\r\nwords had filled her heart with delight. He had never before plainly\r\ndeclared his love to her,--though she had been driven by her father\'s\r\nquestions to declare her own love to herself. She was quite sure of\r\nherself,--that the man was and would always be to her the one being\r\nwhom she would prefer to all others. Her fate was in her father\'s\r\nhands. If he chose to make her wretched he must do so. But on one\r\npoint she had quite made up her mind. She would make no concealment.\r\nTo the world at large she had nothing to say on the matter. But with\r\nher father there should be no attempt on her part to keep back the\r\ntruth. Were he to question her on the subject she would tell him, as\r\nfar as her memory would serve her, the very words which Lopez had\r\nspoken to her this evening. She would ask nothing from him. He had\r\nalready told her that the man was to be rejected, and had refused to\r\ngive any other reason than his dislike to the absence of any English\r\nconnexion. She would not again ask even for a reason. But she would\r\nmake her father understand that though she obeyed him she regarded\r\nthe exercise of his authority as tyrannical and irrational.\r\n\r\nThey left the house before any of the other guests and walked round\r\nthe corner together into the Square. "What a very vulgar set of\r\npeople!" said Mr. Wharton as soon as they were down the steps.\r\n\r\n"Some of them were," said Emily, making a mental reservation of her\r\nown.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t know where to make the exception. Why on earth\r\nany one should want to know such a person as Lord Mongrober I can\'t\r\nunderstand. What does he bring into society?"\r\n\r\n"A title."\r\n\r\n"But what does that do of itself? He is an insolent, bloated brute."\r\n\r\n"Papa, you are using strong language to-night."\r\n\r\n"And that Lady Eustace! Heaven and earth! Am I to be told that that\r\ncreature is a lady?"\r\n\r\nThey had now come to their own door, and while that was being opened\r\nand as they went up into their own drawing-room, nothing was said,\r\nbut then Emily began again. "I wonder why you go to Aunt Harriet\'s at\r\nall. You don\'t like the people?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t like any of them to-day."\r\n\r\n"Why do you go there? You don\'t like Aunt Harriet herself. You don\'t\r\nlike Uncle Dick. You don\'t like Mr. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do not."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know who it is you do like."\r\n\r\n"I like Mr. Fletcher."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no use saying that to me, papa."\r\n\r\n"You ask me a question, and I choose to answer it. I like Arthur\r\nFletcher, because he is a gentleman,--because he is a gentleman of\r\nthe class to which I belong myself; because he works; because I know\r\nall about him, so that I can be sure of him; because he had a decent\r\nfather and mother; because I am safe with him, being quite sure that\r\nhe will say to me neither awkward things nor impertinent things. He\r\nwill not talk to me about driving a mail coach like that foolish\r\nbaronet, nor tell me the price of all his wines like your uncle." Nor\r\nwould Ferdinand Lopez do so, thought Emily to herself. "But in all\r\nsuch matters, my dear, the great thing is like to like. I have spoken\r\nof a young person, merely because I wish you to understand that I\r\ncan sympathise with others besides those of my own age. But to-night\r\nthere was no one there at all like myself,--or, as I hope, like you.\r\nThat man Roby is a chattering ass. How such a man can be useful to\r\nany government I can\'t conceive. Happerton was the best, but what had\r\nhe to say for himself? I\'ve always thought that there was very little\r\nwit wanted to make a fortune in the City." In this frame of mind\r\nMr. Wharton went off to bed, but not a word more was spoken about\r\nFerdinand Lopez.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCarlton Terrace\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly the thing was done very well by Lady Glen,--as many in the\r\npolitical world persisted in calling her even in these days. She had\r\nnot as yet quite carried out her plan,--the doing of which would have\r\nrequired her to reconcile her husband to some excessive abnormal\r\nexpenditure, and to have obtained from him a deliberate sanction for\r\nappropriation and probable sale of property. She never could find the\r\nproper moment for doing this, having, with all her courage,--low down\r\nin some corner of her heart,--a wholesome fear of a certain quiet\r\npower which her husband possessed. She could not bring herself to\r\nmake her proposition;--but she almost acted as though it had been\r\nmade and approved. Her house was always gorgeous with flowers. Of\r\ncourse there would be the bill;--and he, when he saw the exotics, and\r\nthe whole place turned into a bower of ever fresh blooming floral\r\nglories, must know that there would be the bill. And when he found\r\nthat there was an archducal dinner-party every week, and an almost\r\nimperial reception twice a week; that at these receptions a banquet\r\nwas always provided; when he was asked whether she might buy a\r\nmagnificent pair of bay carriage-horses, as to which she assured him\r\nthat nothing so lovely had ever as yet been seen stepping in the\r\nstreets of London,--of course he must know that the bills would come.\r\nIt was better, perhaps, to do it in this way, than to make any direct\r\nproposition. And then, early in June, she spoke to him as to the\r\nguests to be invited to Gatherum Castle in August. "Do you want to\r\ngo to Gatherum in August?" he asked in surprise. For she hated the\r\nplace, and had hardly been content to spend ten days there every year\r\nat Christmas.\r\n\r\n"I think it should be done," she said solemnly. "One cannot quite\r\nconsider just now what one likes oneself."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"You would hardly go to a small place like Matching in your present\r\nposition. There are so many people whom you should entertain! You\r\nwould probably have two or three of the foreign ministers down for a\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"We always used to find plenty of room at Matching."\r\n\r\n"But you did not always use to be Prime Minister. It is only for such\r\na time as this that such a house as Gatherum is serviceable."\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment, thinking about it, and then gave way\r\nwithout another word. She was probably right. There was the huge pile\r\nof magnificent buildings; and somebody, at any rate, had thought that\r\nit behoved a Duke of Omnium to live in such a palace. If it ought to\r\nbe done at any time, it ought to be done now. In that his wife had\r\nbeen right. "Very well. Then let us go there."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll manage it all," said the Duchess,--"I and Locock." Locock was\r\nthe house-steward.\r\n\r\n"I remember once," said the Duke, and he smiled as he spoke with a\r\npeculiarly sweet expression, which would at times come across his\r\ngenerally inexpressive face,--"I remember once that some First\r\nMinister of the Crown gave evidence as to the amount of his salary,\r\nsaying that his place entailed upon him expenses higher than his\r\nstipend would defray. I begin to think that my experience will be the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\n"Does that fret you?"\r\n\r\n"No, Cora;--it certainly does not fret me, or I should not allow it.\r\nBut I think there should be a limit. No man is ever rich enough to\r\nsquander."\r\n\r\nThough they were to squander her fortune,--the money which she\r\nhad brought,--for the next ten years at a much greater rate than\r\nshe contemplated, they might do so without touching the Palliser\r\nproperty. Of that she was quite sure. And the squandering was to be\r\nall for his glory,--so that he might retain his position as a popular\r\nPrime Minister. For an instant it occurred to her that she would tell\r\nhim all this. But she checked herself, and the idea of what she had\r\nbeen about to say brought the blood into her face. Never yet had\r\nshe in talking to him alluded to her own wealth. "Of course we are\r\nspending money," she said. "If you give me a hint to hold my hand, I\r\nwill hold it."\r\n\r\nHe had looked at her, and read it all in her face. "God knows," he\r\nsaid, "you\'ve a right to do it if it pleases you."\r\n\r\n"For your sake!" Then he stooped down and kissed her twice, and\r\nleft her to arrange her parties as she pleased. After that she\r\ncongratulated herself that she had not made the direct proposition,\r\nknowing that she might now do pretty much what she pleased.\r\n\r\nThen there were solemn cabinets held, at which she presided, and\r\nMrs. Finn and Locock assisted. At other cabinets it is supposed that,\r\nlet a leader be ever so autocratic by disposition and superior by\r\nintelligence, still he must not unfrequently yield to the opinion of\r\nhis colleagues. But in this cabinet the Duchess always had her own\r\nway, though she was very persistent in asking for counsel. Locock was\r\nfrightened about the money. Hitherto money had come without a word,\r\nout of the common, spoken to the Duke. The Duke had always signed\r\ncertain cheques, but they had been normal cheques; and the money in\r\nits natural course had flown in to meet them;--but now he must be\r\nasked to sign abnormal cheques. That, indeed, had already been done;\r\nbut still the money had been there. A large balance, such as had\r\nalways stood to his credit, would stand a bigger racket than had yet\r\nbeen made. But Locock was quite sure that the balance ought not to\r\nbe much further reduced,--and that steps must be taken. Something\r\nmust be sold! The idea of selling anything was dreadful to the\r\nmind of Locock! Or else money must be borrowed! Now the management\r\nof the Palliser property had always been conducted on principles\r\nantagonistic to borrowing. "But his Grace has never spent his\r\nincome," said the Duchess. That was true. But the money, as it showed\r\na tendency to heap itself up, had been used for the purchase of other\r\nbits of property, or for the amelioration of the estates generally.\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that we can\'t get money if we want it!" Locock\r\nwas profuse in his assurances that any amount of money could be\r\nobtained,--only that something must be done. "Then let something\r\nbe done," said the Duchess, going on with her general plans. "Many\r\npeople are rich," said the Duchess afterwards to her friend, "and\r\nsome people are very rich indeed; but nobody seems to be rich enough\r\nto have ready money to do just what he wishes. It all goes into a\r\ngrand sum total, which is never to be touched without a feeling of\r\nsacrifice. I suppose you have always enough for everything." It was\r\nwell known that the present Mrs. Finn, as Madame Goesler, had been a\r\nwealthy woman.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, no;--very far from that. I haven\'t a shilling."\r\n\r\n"What has happened?" asked the Duchess, pretending to be frightened.\r\n\r\n"You forget that I\'ve got a husband of my own, and that he has to be\r\nconsulted."\r\n\r\n"That must be nonsense. But don\'t you think women are fools to marry\r\nwhen they\'ve got anything of their own, and could be their own\r\nmistresses? I couldn\'t have been. I was made to marry before I was\r\nold enough to assert myself."\r\n\r\n"And how well they did for you!"\r\n\r\n"Pas si mal.--He\'s Prime Minister, which is a great thing, and I\r\nbegin to find myself filled to the full with political ambition.\r\nI feel myself to be a Lady Macbeth, prepared for the murder of\r\nany Duncan or any Daubeny who may stand in my lord\'s way. In\r\nthe meantime, like Lady Macbeth herself, we must attend to the\r\nbanqueting. Her lord appeared and misbehaved himself; my lord won\'t\r\nshow himself at all,--which I think is worse."\r\n\r\nOur old friend Phineas Finn, who had now reached a higher place in\r\npolitics than even his political dreams had assigned to him, though\r\nhe was a Member of Parliament, was much away from London in these\r\ndays. New brooms sweep clean; and official new brooms, I think, sweep\r\ncleaner than any other. Who has not watched at the commencement of\r\na Ministry some Secretary, some Lord, or some Commissioner, who\r\nintends by fresh Herculean labours to cleanse the Augean stables just\r\ncommitted to his care? Who does not know the gentleman at the Home\r\nOffice, who means to reform the police and put an end to malefactors;\r\nor the new Minister at the Board of Works, who is to make London\r\nbeautiful as by a magician\'s stroke,--or, above all, the new First\r\nLord, who is resolved that he will really build us a fleet, purge\r\nthe dock-yards, and save us half a million a year at the same\r\ntime? Phineas Finn was bent on unriddling the Irish sphinx. Surely\r\nsomething might be done to prove to his susceptible countrymen that\r\nat the present moment no curse could be laid upon them so heavy as\r\nthat of having to rule themselves apart from England; and he thought\r\nthat this might be the easier, as he became from day to day more\r\nthoroughly convinced that those Home Rulers who were all around\r\nhim in the House were altogether of the same opinion. Had some\r\ninscrutable decree of fate ordained and made it certain,--with a\r\ncertainty not to be disturbed,--that no candidate could be returned\r\nto Parliament who would not assert the earth to be triangular, there\r\nwould rise immediately a clamorous assertion of triangularity among\r\npolitical aspirants. The test would be innocent. Candidates have\r\nswallowed, and daily do swallow, many a worse one. As might be this\r\ndoctrine of a great triangle, so is the doctrine of Home Rule. Why is\r\na gentleman of property to be kept out in the cold by some O\'Mullins\r\nbecause he will not mutter an unmeaning shibboleth? "Triangular?\r\nYes,--or lozenge-shaped, if you please; but, gentlemen, I am the man\r\nfor Tipperary." Phineas Finn, having seen, or thought that he had\r\nseen, all this, began, from the very first moment of his appointment,\r\nto consider painfully within himself whether the genuine services of\r\nan honest and patriotic man might not compass some remedy for the\r\npresent ill-boding ferment of the country. What was it that the Irish\r\nreally did want;--what that they wanted, and had not got, and which\r\nmight with propriety be conceded to them? What was it that the\r\nEnglish really would refuse to sanction, even though it might not be\r\nwanted? He found himself beating about among rocks as to Catholic\r\neducation and Papal interference, the passage among which might be\r\nmade clearer to him in Irish atmosphere than in that of Westminster.\r\nTherefore he was away a good deal in these days, travelling backwards\r\nand forwards as he might be wanted for any debate. But as his wife\r\ndid not accompany him on these fitful journeys, she was able to give\r\nher time very much to the Duchess.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was on the whole very successful with her parties. There\r\nwere people who complained that she had everybody; that there was no\r\nselection whatever as to politics, principles, rank, morals,--or even\r\nmanners. But in such a work as the Duchess had now taken in hand, it\r\nwas impossible that she should escape censure. They who really knew\r\nwhat was being done were aware that nobody was asked to that house\r\nwithout an idea that his or her presence might be desirable,--in\r\nhowever remote a degree. Paragraphs in newspapers go for much,\r\nand therefore the writers and editors of such paragraphs were\r\nthere,--sometimes with their wives. Mr. Broune, of the "Breakfast\r\nTable," was to be seen there constantly, with his wife Lady Carbury,\r\nand poor old Booker of the "Literary Chronicle." City men can make a\r\nbudget popular or the reverse, and therefore the Mills Happertons of\r\nthe day were welcome. Rising barristers might be wanted to become\r\nSolicitors-General. The pet Orpheus of the hour, the young tragic\r\nactor who was thought to have a real Hamlet within him, the old\r\npainter who was growing rich on his reputation, and the young painter\r\nwho was still strong with hope, even the little trilling poet, though\r\nhe trilled never so faintly, and the somewhat wooden novelist, all\r\nhad tongues of their own, and certain modes of expression, which\r\nmight assist or injure the Palliser Coalition,--as the Duke\'s\r\nMinistry was now called.\r\n\r\n"Who is that man? I\'ve seen him here before. The Duchess was talking\r\nto him ever so long just now." The question was asked by Mr. Rattler\r\nof Mr. Roby. About half-an-hour before this time Mr. Rattler had\r\nessayed to get a few words with the Duchess, beginning with the\r\ncommunication of some small political secret. But the Duchess did not\r\ncare much for the Rattlers attached to her husband\'s Government. They\r\nwere men whose services could be had for a certain payment,--and when\r\npaid for were, the Duchess thought, at the Premier\'s command without\r\nfurther trouble. Of course they came to the receptions, and were\r\nentitled to a smile apiece as they entered. But they were entitled\r\nto nothing more, and on this occasion Rattler had felt himself to be\r\nsnubbed. It did not occur to him to abuse the Duchess. The Duchess\r\nwas too necessary for abuse,--just at present. But any friend of the\r\nDuchess,--any favourite for the moment,--was, of course, open to\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n"He is a man named Lopez," said Roby, "a friend of Happerton;--a very\r\nclever fellow, they say."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see him anywhere else?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes;--I have met him at dinner."\r\n\r\n"He was never in the House. What does he do?" Rattler was distressed\r\nto think that any drone should have made its way into the hive of\r\nworking bees.\r\n\r\n"Oh;--money, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not a partner in Hunky\'s, is he?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy not. I think I should have known if he was."\r\n\r\n"She ought to remember that people make a use of coming here," said\r\nRattler. She was, of course, the Duchess. "It\'s not like a private\r\nhouse. And whatever influence outsiders get by coming, so much she\r\nloses. Somebody ought to explain that to her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you or I could do that," replied Mr. Roby.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell the Duke in a minute," said Rattler. Perhaps he thought\r\nhe could tell the Duke, but we may be allowed to doubt whether his\r\nprowess would not have fallen below the necessary pitch when he met\r\nthe Duke\'s eye.\r\n\r\nLopez was there for the third time, about the middle of June, and had\r\ncertainly contrived to make himself personally known to the Duchess.\r\nThere had been a deputation from the City to the Prime Minister\r\nasking for a subsidised mail, via San Francisco, to Japan, and Lopez,\r\nthough he had no interest in Japan, had contrived to be one of the\r\nnumber. He had contrived also, as the deputation was departing, to\r\nsay a word on his own account to the Minister, and had ingratiated\r\nhimself. The Duke had remembered him, and had suggested that he\r\nshould have a card. And now he was among the flowers and the\r\ngreatness, the beauty, the politics, and the fashion of the Duchess\'s\r\ngatherings for the third time. "It is very well done,--very well,\r\nindeed," said Mr. Boffin to him. Lopez had been dining with Mr. and\r\nMrs. Boffin, and had now again encountered his late host and hostess.\r\nMr. Boffin was a gentleman who had belonged to the late Ministry, but\r\nhad somewhat out-Heroded Herod in his Conservatism, so as to have\r\nbeen considered to be unfit for the Coalition. Of course, he was\r\nproud of his own staunchness, and a little inclined to criticise the\r\nlax principles of men who, for the sake of carrying on her Majesty\'s\r\nGovernment, could be Conservatives one day and Liberals the next. He\r\nwas a laborious, honest man,--but hardly of calibre sufficient not\r\nto regret his own honesty in such an emergency as the present. It is\r\neasy for most of us to keep our hands from picking and stealing when\r\npicking and stealing plainly lead to prison diet and prison garments.\r\nBut when silks and satins come of it, and with the silks and satins\r\ngeneral respect, the net result of honesty does not seem to be\r\nso secure. Whence will come the reward, and when? On whom the\r\npunishment, and where? A man will not, surely, be damned for\r\nbelonging to a Coalition Ministry! Boffin was a little puzzled as he\r\nthought on all this, but in the meantime was very proud of his own\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\n"I think it is so lovely!" said Mrs. Boffin. "You look down through\r\nan Elysium of rhododendrons into a Paradise of mirrors. I don\'t think\r\nthere was ever anything like it in London before."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that we ever had anybody at the same time rich enough\r\nto do this kind of thing as it is done now," said Boffin, "and\r\npowerful enough to get such people together. If the country can be\r\nruled by flowers and looking-glasses, of course it is very well."\r\n\r\n"Flowers and looking-glasses won\'t prevent the country being ruled\r\nwell," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure of that," continued Boffin. "We all know what bread\r\nand the games came to in Rome."\r\n\r\n"What did they come to?" asked Mrs. Boffin.\r\n\r\n"To a man burning Rome, my dear, for his amusement, dressed in a\r\nsatin petticoat and a wreath of roses."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think the Duke will dress himself like that," said Mrs.\r\nBoffin.\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t think," said Lopez, "that the graceful expenditure of\r\nwealth in a rich man\'s house has any tendency to demoralise the\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"The attempt here," said Boffin severely, "is to demoralise the\r\nrulers of the people. I am glad to have come once to see how the\r\nthing is done; but as an independent member of the House of Commons I\r\nshould not wish to be known to frequent the saloon of the Duchess."\r\nThen Mr. Boffin took away Mrs. Boffin, much to that lady\'s regret.\r\n\r\n"This is fairy land," said Lopez to the Duchess, as he left the room.\r\n\r\n"Come and be a fairy then," she answered, very graciously. "We are\r\nalways on the wing about this hour on Wednesday night." The words\r\ncontained a general invitation for the season, and were esteemed by\r\nLopez as an indication of great favour. It must be acknowledged of\r\nthe Duchess that she was prone to make favourites, perhaps without\r\nadequate cause; though it must be conceded to her that she rarely\r\naltogether threw off from her any one whom she had once taken to her\r\ngood graces. It must also be confessed that when she had allowed\r\nherself to hate either a man or a woman, she generally hated on\r\nto the end. No Paradise could be too charming for her friends; no\r\nPandemonium too frightful for her enemies. In reference to Mr. Lopez\r\nshe would have said, if interrogated, that she had taken the man up\r\nin obedience to her husband. But in truth she had liked the look and\r\nthe voice of the man. Her husband before now had recommended men to\r\nher notice and kindness, whom at the first trial she had rejected\r\nfrom her good-will, and whom she had continued to reject ever\r\nafterwards, let her husband\'s urgency be what it might.\r\n\r\nAnother old friend, of whom former chronicles were not silent, was at\r\nthe Duchess\'s that night, and there came across Mrs. Finn. This was\r\nBarrington Erle, a politician of long standing, who was still looked\r\nupon by many as a young man, because he had always been known as a\r\nyoung man, and because he had never done anything to compromise his\r\nposition in that respect. He had not married, or settled himself down\r\nin a house of his own, or become subject to gout, or given up being\r\ncareful about the fitting of his clothes. No doubt the grey hairs\r\nwere getting the better of the black hairs, both on his head and\r\nface, and marks of coming crows\' feet were to be seen if you looked\r\nclose at him, and he had become careful about his great-coat and\r\numbrella. He was in truth much nearer fifty than forty;--nevertheless\r\nhe was felt in the House and among Cabinet Ministers, and among the\r\nwives of members and Cabinet Ministers, to be a young man still. And\r\nwhen he was invited to become Secretary for Ireland it was generally\r\nfelt that he was too young for the place. He declined it, however;\r\nand when he went to the Post-office, the gentlemen there all felt\r\nthat they had had a boy put over them. Phineas Finn, who had become\r\nSecretary for Ireland, was in truth ten years his junior. But Phineas\r\nFinn had been twice married, and had gone through other phases of\r\nlife, such as make a man old. "How does Phineas like it?" Erle asked.\r\nPhineas Finn and Barrington Erle had gone through some political\r\nstruggles together, and had been very intimate.\r\n\r\n"I hope not very much," said the lady.\r\n\r\n"Why so? Because he\'s away so much?"\r\n\r\n"No;--not that. I should not grudge his absence if the work satisfied\r\nhim. But I know him so well. The more he takes to it now,--the more\r\nsanguine he is as to some special thing to be done,--the more bitter\r\nwill be the disappointment when he is disappointed. For there never\r\nreally is anything special to be done;--is there, Mr. Erle?"\r\n\r\n"I think there is always a little too much zeal about Finn."\r\n\r\n"Of course there is. And then with zeal there always goes a thin\r\nskin,--and unjustifiable expectations, and biting despair, and\r\ncontempt of others, and all the elements of unhappiness."\r\n\r\n"That is a sad programme for your husband."\r\n\r\n"He has recuperative faculties which bring him round at last:--but I\r\nreally doubt whether he was made for a politician in this country.\r\nYou remember Lord Brock?"\r\n\r\n"Dear old Brock;--of course I do. How should I not, if you remember\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"Young men are boys at college, rowing in boats, when women have been\r\never so long out in the world. He was the very model of an English\r\nstatesman. He loved his country dearly, and wished her to be, as he\r\nbelieved her to be, first among nations. But he had no belief in\r\nperpetuating her greatness by any grand improvements. Let things take\r\ntheir way naturally,--with a slight direction hither or thither as\r\nthings might require. That was his method of ruling. He believed in\r\nmen rather than measures. As long as he had loyalty around him, he\r\ncould be personally happy, and quite confident as to the country. He\r\nnever broke his heart because he could not carry this or that reform.\r\nWhat would have hurt him would have been to be worsted in personal\r\nconflict. But he could always hold his own, and he was always\r\nhappy. Your man with a thin skin, a vehement ambition, a scrupulous\r\nconscience, and a sanguine desire for rapid improvement, is never a\r\nhappy, and seldom a fortunate politician."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Finn, you understand it all better than any one else that I\r\never knew."\r\n\r\n"I have been watching it a long time, and of course very closely\r\nsince I have been married."\r\n\r\n"But you have an eye trained to see it all. What a useful member you\r\nwould have been in a government!"\r\n\r\n"But I should never have had patience to sit all night upon that\r\nbench in the House of Commons. How men can do it! They mustn\'t read.\r\nThey can\'t think because of the speaking. It doesn\'t do for them to\r\ntalk. I don\'t believe they ever listen. It isn\'t in human nature to\r\nlisten hour after hour to such platitudes. I believe they fall into a\r\nhabit of half-wakeful sleeping, which carries them through the hours;\r\nbut even that can\'t be pleasant. I look upon the Treasury Bench in\r\nJuly as a sort of casual-ward which we know to be necessary, but is\r\nalmost too horrid to be contemplated."\r\n\r\n"Men do get bread and skilly there certainly; but, Mrs. Finn, we can\r\ngo into the library and smoking-room."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--and a clerk in an office can read the newspapers instead\r\nof doing his duty. But there is a certain surveillance exercised, and\r\na certain quantity of work exacted. I have met Lords of the Treasury\r\nout at dinner on Mondays and Thursdays, but we all regard them as\r\nboys who have shirked out of school. I think upon the whole, Mr.\r\nErle, we women have the best of it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose you will go in for your \'rights\'."\r\n\r\n"Not by Act of Parliament, or by platform meeting. I have a great\r\nidea of a woman\'s rights; but that is the way, I think, to throw them\r\naway. What do you think of the Duchess\'s evenings?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Glen is in her way as great a woman as you are;--perhaps\r\ngreater, because nothing ever stops her."\r\n\r\n"Whereas I have scruples."\r\n\r\n"Her Grace has none. She has feelings and convictions which keep her\r\nstraight, but no scruples. Look at her now talking to Sir Orlando\r\nDrought, a man whom she both hates and despises. I am sure she is\r\nlooking forward to some happy time in which the Duke may pitch\r\nSir Orlando overboard, and rule supreme, with me or some other\r\nsubordinate leading the House of Commons simply as lieutenant. Such a\r\ntime will never come, but that is her idea. But she is talking to Sir\r\nOrlando now as if she were pouring her full confidence into his ear,\r\nand Sir Orlando is believing her. Sir Orlando is in a seventh heaven,\r\nand she is measuring his credulity inch by inch."\r\n\r\n"She makes the place very bright."\r\n\r\n"And is spending an enormous deal of money," said Barrington Erle.\r\n\r\n"What does it matter?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no;--if the Duke likes it. I had an idea that the Duke would\r\nnot like the display of the thing. There he is. Do you see him in the\r\ncorner with his brother duke? He doesn\'t look as if he were happy;\r\ndoes he? No one would think he was the master of everything here. He\r\nhas got himself hidden almost behind the screen. I\'m sure he doesn\'t\r\nlike it."\r\n\r\n"He tries to like whatever she likes," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\nAs her husband was away in Ireland, Mrs. Finn was staying in the\r\nhouse in Carlton Gardens. The Duchess at present required so much of\r\nher time that this was found to be convenient. When, therefore, the\r\nguests on the present occasion had all gone, the Duchess and Mrs.\r\nFinn were left together. "Did you ever see anything so hopeless as he\r\nis?" said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Who is hopeless?"\r\n\r\n"Heavens and earth! Plantagenet;--who else? Is there another man in\r\nthe world would come into his own house, among his own guests, and\r\nspeak only to one person? And, then, think of it! Popularity is\r\nthe staff on which alone Ministers can lean in this country with\r\nsecurity."\r\n\r\n"Political but not social popularity."\r\n\r\n"You know as well as I do that the two go together. We\'ve seen enough\r\nof that even in our day. What broke up Mr. Gresham\'s Ministry? If\r\nhe had stayed away people might have thought that he was reading\r\nblue-books, or calculating coinage, or preparing a speech. That would\r\nhave been much better. But he comes in and sits for half-an-hour\r\nwhispering to another duke! I hate dukes!"\r\n\r\n"He talks to the Duke of St. Bungay because there is no one he trusts\r\nso much. A few years ago it would have been Mr. Mildmay."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the Duchess angrily, "you treat me as though I were\r\na child. Of course I know why he chooses that old man out of all the\r\ncrowd. I don\'t suppose he does it from any stupid pride of rank.\r\nI know very well what set of ideas govern him. But that isn\'t the\r\npoint. He has to reflect what others think of it, and to endeavour\r\nto do what will please them. There was I telling tarradiddles by the\r\nyard to that old oaf, Sir Orlando Drought, when a confidential word\r\nfrom Plantagenet would have had ten times more effect. And why can\'t\r\nhe speak a word to the people\'s wives? They wouldn\'t bite him. He has\r\ngot to say a few words to you sometimes,--to whom it doesn\'t signify,\r\nmy dear--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that."\r\n\r\n"But he never speaks to another woman. He was here this evening\r\nfor exactly forty minutes, and he didn\'t open his lips to a female\r\ncreature. I watched him. How on earth am I to pull him through if he\r\ngoes on in that way? Yes, Locock, I\'ll go to bed, and I don\'t think\r\nI\'ll get up for a week."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Gathering of Clouds\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout June and the first week of July the affairs of the\r\nMinistry went on successfully, in spite of the social sins of the\r\nDuke and the occasional despair of the Duchess. There had been many\r\npoliticians who had thought, or had, at any rate, predicted, that\r\nthe Coalition Ministry would not live a month. There had been\r\nmen, such as Lord Fawn on one side and Mr. Boffin on the other,\r\nwho had found themselves stranded disagreeably,--with no certain\r\nposition,--unwilling to sit immediately behind a Treasury bench from\r\nwhich they were excluded, and too shy to place themselves immediately\r\nopposite. Seats beneath the gangway were, of course, open to such of\r\nthem as were members of the Lower House, and those seats had to be\r\nused; but they were not accustomed to sit beneath the gangway. These\r\ngentlemen had expected that the seeds of weakness, of which they had\r\nperceived the scattering, would grow at once into an enormous crop of\r\nblunders, difficulties, and complications; but, for a while, the\r\nMinistry were saved from these dangers either by the energy of the\r\nPrime Minister, or the popularity of his wife, or perhaps by the\r\nsagacity of the elder Duke;--so that there grew up an idea that the\r\nCoalition was really the proper thing. In one respect it certainly\r\nwas successful. The Home Rulers, or Irish party generally, were left\r\nwithout an inch of standing ground. Their support was not needed, and\r\ntherefore they were not courted. For the moment there was not even\r\na necessity to pretend that Home Rule was anything but an absurdity\r\nfrom beginning to end;--so much so that one or two leading Home\r\nRulers, men who had taken up the cause not only that they might\r\nbecome Members of Parliament, but with some further ideas of\r\nspeech-making and popularity, declared that the Coalition had been\r\nformed merely with a view of putting down Ireland. This capability of\r\ndispensing with a generally untractable element of support was felt\r\nto be a great comfort. Then, too, there was a set in the House,--at\r\nthe moment not a very numerous set,--who had been troublesome friends\r\nto the old Liberal party, and which the Coalition was able, if not to\r\nignore, at any rate to disregard. These were the staunch economists,\r\nand argumentative philosophical Radicals,--men of standing and\r\nrepute, who are always in doubtful times individually flattered by\r\nMinisters, who have great privileges accorded to them of speaking and\r\ndividing, and who are not unfrequently even thanked for their rods by\r\nthe very owners of the backs which bear the scourges. These men could\r\nnot be quite set aside by the Coalition as were the Home Rulers. It\r\nwas not even yet, perhaps, wise to count them out, or to leave them\r\nto talk to benches absolutely empty;--but the tone of flattery with\r\nwhich they had been addressed became gradually less warm; and when\r\nthe scourges were wielded, ministerial backs took themselves out of\r\nthe way. There grew up unconsciously a feeling of security against\r\nattack which was distasteful to these gentlemen, and was in\r\nitself perhaps a little dangerous. Gentlemen bound to support the\r\nGovernment, when they perceived that there was comparatively but\r\nlittle to do, and that that little might be easily done, became\r\ncareless, and, perhaps, a little contemptuous. So that the great\r\npopular orator, Mr. Turnbull, found himself compelled to rise in his\r\nseat, and ask whether the noble Duke at the head of the Government\r\nthought himself strong enough to rule without attention to\r\nParliamentary details. The question was asked with an air of\r\ninexorable severity, and was intended to have deep signification. Mr.\r\nTurnbull had disliked the Coalition from the beginning; but then Mr.\r\nTurnbull always disliked everything. He had so accustomed himself to\r\nwield the constitutional cat-of-nine-tails, that heaven will hardly\r\nbe happy to him unless he be allowed to flog the cherubim. Though the\r\nparty with which he was presumed to act had generally been in power\r\nsince he had been in the House, he had never allowed himself to agree\r\nwith a Minister on any point. And as he had never been satisfied\r\nwith a Liberal Government, it was not probable that he should endure\r\na Coalition in silence. At the end of a rather lengthy speech, he\r\nrepeated his question, and then sat down, taking his place with all\r\nthat constitutional indignation which becomes the parliamentary\r\nflagellator of the day. The little jokes with which Sir Orlando\r\nanswered him were very well in their way. Mr. Turnbull did not care\r\nmuch whether he were answered or not. Perhaps the jauntiness of Sir\r\nOrlando, which implied that the Coalition was too strong to regard\r\nattack, somewhat irritated outsiders. But there certainly grew up\r\nfrom that moment a feeling among such men as Erle and Rattler that\r\ncare was necessary, that the House, taken as a whole, was not in a\r\ncondition to be manipulated with easy freedom, and that Sir Orlando\r\nmust be made to understand that he was not strong enough to depend\r\nupon jauntiness. The jaunty statesman must be very sure of his\r\npersonal following. There was a general opinion that Sir Orlando had\r\nnot brought the Coalition well out of the first real attack which had\r\nbeen made upon it.\r\n\r\n"Well, Phineas; how do you like the Phoenix?" Phineas Finn had\r\nflown back to London at the instigation probably of Mr. Rattler, and\r\nwas now standing at the window of Brooks\'s club with Barrington Erle.\r\nIt was near nine one Thursday evening, and they were both about to\r\nreturn to the House.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like the Castle, if you mean that."\r\n\r\n"Tyrone isn\'t troublesome, surely?" The Marquis of Tyrone was the\r\nLord Lieutenant of the day, and had in his time been a very strong\r\nConservative.\r\n\r\n"He finds me troublesome, I fear."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder at that, Phineas."\r\n\r\n"How should it be otherwise? What can he and I have in sympathy with\r\none another? He has been brought up with all an Orangeman\'s hatred\r\nfor a Papist. Now that he is in high office, he can abandon the\r\ndisplay of the feeling,--perhaps the feeling itself as regards the\r\ncountry at large. He knows that it doesn\'t become a Lord Lieutenant\r\nto be Orange. But how can he put himself into a boat with me?"\r\n\r\n"All that kind of thing vanishes when a man is in office."\r\n\r\n"Yes, as a rule; because men go together into office with the same\r\ngeneral predilections. Is it too hot to walk down?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll walk a little way,--till you make me hot by arguing."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t an argument left in me," said Phineas. "Of course\r\neverything over there seems easy enough now,--so easy that Lord\r\nTyrone evidently imagines that the good times are coming back in\r\nwhich governors may govern and not be governed."\r\n\r\n"You are pretty quiet in Ireland now, I suppose;--no martial law,\r\nsuspension of the habeas corpus, or anything of that kind, just at\r\npresent?"\r\n\r\n"No; thank goodness!" said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not quite sure whether a general suspension of the habeas corpus\r\nwould not upon the whole be the most comfortable state of things for\r\nIrishmen themselves. But whether good or bad, you\'ve nothing of that\r\nkind of thing now. You\'ve no great measure that you wish to pass?"\r\n\r\n"But they\'ve a great measure that they wish to pass."\r\n\r\n"They know better than that. They don\'t want to kill their golden\r\ngoose."\r\n\r\n"The people, who are infinitely ignorant of all political work,\r\ndo want it. There are counties in which, if you were to poll the\r\npeople, Home Rule would carry nearly every voter,--except the members\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t give it them?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not;--any more than I would allow a son to ruin himself\r\nbecause he asked me. But I would endeavour to teach them that they\r\ncan get nothing by Home Rule,--that their taxes would be heavier,\r\ntheir property less secure, their lives less safe, their general\r\nposition more debased, and their chances of national success more\r\nremote than ever."\r\n\r\n"You can never teach them, except by the slow lesson of habit. The\r\nHeptarchy didn\'t mould itself into a nation in a day."\r\n\r\n"Men were governed then, and could be and were moulded. I feel sure\r\nthat even in Ireland there is a stratum of men, above the working\r\npeasants, who would understand, and make those below them understand,\r\nthe position of the country, if they could only be got to give up\r\nfighting about religion. Even now Home Rule is regarded by the\r\nmultitude as a weapon to be used against Protestantism on behalf of\r\nthe Pope."\r\n\r\n"I suppose the Pope is the great sinner?"\r\n\r\n"They got over the Pope in France,--even in early days, before\r\nreligion had become a farce in the country. They have done so in\r\nItaly."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--they\'ve got over the Pope in Italy, certainly."\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Phineas, "the bulk of the people are staunch\r\nCatholics. Of course the same attempt to maintain a temporal\r\ninfluence, with the hope of recovering temporal power, is made in\r\nother countries. But while we see the attempt failing elsewhere,--so\r\nthat we know that the power of the Church is going to the wall,--yet\r\nin Ireland it is infinitely stronger now than it was fifty, or even\r\ntwenty years ago."\r\n\r\n"Because we have been removing restraints on Papal aggression, while\r\nother nations have been imposing restraints. There are those at\r\nRome who believe all England to be Romish at heart, because here in\r\nEngland a Roman Catholic can say what he will, and print what he\r\nwill."\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Phineas, "all England does not return one Catholic to\r\nthe House, while we have Jews in plenty. You have a Jew among your\r\nEnglish judges, but at present not a single Roman Catholic. What do\r\nyou suppose are the comparative numbers of the population here in\r\nEngland?"\r\n\r\n"And you are going to cure all this;--while Tyrone thinks it ought to\r\nbe left as it is? I rather agree with Tyrone."\r\n\r\n"No," said Phineas, wearily; "I doubt whether I shall ever cure\r\nanything, or even make any real attempt. My patriotism just goes far\r\nenough to make me unhappy, and Lord Tyrone thinks that while Dublin\r\nladies dance at the Castle, and the list of agrarian murders is kept\r\nlow, the country is admirably managed. I don\'t quite agree with\r\nhim;--that\'s all."\r\n\r\nThen there arose a legal difficulty, which caused much trouble to the\r\nCoalition Ministry. There fell vacant a certain seat on the bench of\r\njudges,--a seat of considerable dignity and importance, but not quite\r\nof the highest rank. Sir Gregory Grogram, who was a rich, energetic\r\nman, determined to have a peerage, and convinced that, should\r\nthe Coalition fall to pieces, the Liberal element would be in\r\nthe ascendant,--so that the woolsack would then be opened to\r\nhim,--declined to occupy the place. Sir Timothy Beeswax, the\r\nSolicitor-General, saw that it was exactly suited for him, and had no\r\nhesitation in expressing his opinion to that effect. But the place\r\nwas not given to Sir Timothy. It was explained to Sir Timothy that\r\nthe old rule,--or rather custom,--of offering certain high positions\r\nto the law officers of the Crown had been abrogated. Some Prime\r\nMinister, or, more probably, some collection of Cabinet Ministers,\r\nhad asserted the custom to be a bad one,--and, as far as right went,\r\nSir Timothy was declared not to have a leg to stand upon. He was\r\ninformed that his services in the House were too valuable to be so\r\nlost. Some people said that his temper was against him. Others were\r\nof opinion that he had risen from the ranks too quickly, and that\r\nLord Ramsden, who had come from the same party, thought that Sir\r\nTimothy had not yet won his spurs. The Solicitor-General resigned\r\nin a huff, and then withdrew his resignation. Sir Gregory thought\r\nthe withdrawal should not be accepted, having found Sir Timothy to\r\nbe an unsympathetic colleague. Our Duke consulted the old Duke,\r\namong whose theories of official life forbearance to all colleagues\r\nand subordinates was conspicuous. The withdrawal was, therefore,\r\nallowed,--but the Coalition could not after that be said to be strong\r\nin regard to its Law Officers.\r\n\r\nBut the first concerted attack against the Ministry was made in\r\nreference to the budget. Mr. Monk, who had consented to undertake the\r\nduties of Chancellor of the Exchequer under the urgent entreaties\r\nof the two dukes, was of course late with his budget. It was April\r\nbefore the Coalition had been formed. The budget when produced had\r\nbeen very popular. Budgets, like babies, are always little loves\r\nwhen first born. But as their infancy passes away, they also become\r\nsubject to many stripes. The details are less pleasing than was the\r\nwhole in the hands of the nurse. There was a certain "interest,"\r\nvery influential both by general wealth and by the presence of many\r\nmembers in the House, which thought that Mr. Monk had disregarded its\r\njust claims. Mr. Monk had refused to relieve the Brewers from their\r\nlicences. Now the Brewers had for some years been agitating about\r\ntheir licences,--and it is acknowledged in politics that any measure\r\nis to be carried, or to be left out in the cold uncarried and\r\nneglected, according to the number of deputations which may be got to\r\npress a Minister on the subject. Now the Brewers had had deputation\r\nafter deputation to many Chancellors of the Exchequer; and these\r\ndeputations had been most respectable,--we may almost say imperative.\r\nIt was quite usual for a deputation to have four or five County\r\nmembers among its body, all Brewers; and the average wealth of a\r\ndeputation of Brewers would buy up half London. All the Brewers in\r\nthe House had been among the supporters of the Coalition, the number\r\nof Liberal and Conservative Brewers having been about equal. But\r\nnow there was a fear that the "interest" might put itself into\r\nopposition. Mr. Monk had been firm. More than one of the Ministry had\r\nwished to yield;--but he had discussed the matter with his Chief, and\r\nthey were both very firm. The Duke had never doubted. Mr. Monk had\r\nnever doubted. From day to day certain organs of the Press expressed\r\nan opinion, gradually increasing in strength, that however strong\r\nmight be the Coalition as a body, it was weak as to finance. This was\r\nhard, because not very many years ago the Duke himself had been known\r\nas a particularly strong Minister of Finance. An amendment was moved\r\nin Committee as to the Brewers\' Licences, and there was almost a\r\ngeneral opinion that the Coalition would be broken up. Mr. Monk would\r\ncertainly not remain in office if the Brewers were to be relieved\r\nfrom their licences.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Phineas Finn was recalled from Ireland in red-hot\r\nhaste. The measure was debated for a couple of nights, and Mr. Monk\r\ncarried his point. The Brewers\' Licences were allowed to remain, as\r\none great gentleman from Burton declared, a "disgrace to the fiscal\r\nsagacity of the country." The Coalition was so far victorious;--but\r\nthere arose a general feeling that its strength had been impaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton Complains\r\n\r\n\r\n"I think you have betrayed me." This accusation was brought by Mr.\r\nWharton against Mrs. Roby in that lady\'s drawing-room, and was\r\noccasioned by a report that had been made to the old lawyer by his\r\ndaughter. He was very angry and almost violent;--so much so that by\r\nhis manner he gave a considerable advantage to the lady whom he was\r\naccusing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Roby undoubtedly had betrayed her brother-in-law. She had been\r\nfalse to the trust reposed in her. He had explained his wishes to\r\nher in regard to his daughter, to whom she had in some sort assumed\r\nto stand in place of a mother, and she, while pretending to act in\r\naccordance with his wishes, had directly opposed them. But it was not\r\nlikely that he would be able to prove her treachery though he might\r\nbe sure of it. He had desired that his girl should see as little as\r\npossible of Ferdinand Lopez, but had hesitated to give a positive\r\norder that she should not meet him. He had indeed himself taken her\r\nto a dinner party at which he knew that she would meet him. But\r\nMrs. Roby had betrayed him. Since the dinner party she had arranged\r\na meeting at her own house on behalf of the lover,--as to which\r\narrangement Emily Wharton had herself been altogether innocent. Emily\r\nhad met the man in her aunt\'s house, not expecting to meet him, and\r\nthe lover had had an opportunity of speaking his mind freely. She\r\nalso had spoken hers freely. She would not engage herself to him\r\nwithout her father\'s consent. With that consent she would do so,--oh,\r\nso willingly! She did not coy her love. He might be certain that she\r\nwould give herself to no one else. Her heart was entirely his. But\r\nshe had pledged herself to her father, and on no consideration would\r\nshe break that pledge. She went on to say that after what had passed\r\nshe thought that they had better not meet. In such meetings there\r\ncould be no satisfaction, and must be much pain. But he had her\r\nfull permission to use any arguments that he could use with her\r\nfather. On the evening of that day she told her father all that had\r\npassed,--omitting no detail either of what she had said or of what\r\nhad been said to her,--adding a positive assurance of obedience,\r\nbut doing so with a severe solemnity and apparent consciousness of\r\nill-usage which almost broke her father\'s heart. "Your aunt must have\r\nhad him there on purpose," Mr. Wharton had said. But Emily would\r\nneither accuse nor defend her aunt. "I at least knew nothing of it,"\r\nshe said. "I know that," Mr. Wharton had ejaculated. "I know that.\r\nI don\'t accuse you of anything, my dear,--except of thinking that\r\nyou understand the world better than I do." Then Emily had retired\r\nand Mr. Wharton had been left to pass half the night in a perplexed\r\nreverie, feeling that he would be forced ultimately to give way, and\r\nyet certain that by doing so he would endanger his child\'s happiness.\r\n\r\nHe was very angry with his sister-in-law, and on the next day, early\r\nin the morning, he attacked her. "I think you have betrayed me," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that, Mr. Wharton?"\r\n\r\n"You have had this man here on purpose that he might make love to\r\nEmily."\r\n\r\n"I have done no such thing. You told me yourself that they were not\r\nto be kept apart. He comes here, and it would be very odd indeed if I\r\nwere to tell the servants that he is not to be admitted. If you want\r\nto quarrel with me, of course you can. I have always endeavoured to\r\nbe a good friend to Emily."\r\n\r\n"It is not being a good friend to her, bringing her and this\r\nadventurer together."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you call him an adventurer. But you are so very\r\nodd in your ideas! He is received everywhere, and is always at the\r\nDuchess of Omnium\'s."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a fig about the Duchess."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not. Only the Duke happens to be Prime Minister, and his\r\nhouse is considered to have the very best society that England, or\r\nindeed Europe, can give. And I think it is something in a young man\'s\r\nfavour when it is known that he associates with such persons as the\r\nDuke of Omnium. I believe that most fathers would have a regard to\r\nthe company which a man keeps when they think of their daughter\'s\r\nmarrying."\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t thinking of her marrying. I don\'t want her to marry;--not\r\nthis man at least. And I fancy the Duchess of Omnium is just as\r\nlikely to have scamps in her drawing-room as any other lady in\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\n"And do such men as Mr. Happerton associate with scamps?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about Mr. Happerton,--and I don\'t care\r\nanything about him."\r\n\r\n"He has L20,000 a year out of his business. And does Everett\r\nassociate with scamps?"\r\n\r\n"Very likely."\r\n\r\n"I never knew any one so much prejudiced as you are, Mr. Wharton.\r\nWhen you have a point to carry there\'s nothing you won\'t say. I\r\nsuppose it comes from being in the courts."\r\n\r\n"The long and the short of it is this," said the lawyer; "if I find\r\nthat Emily is brought here to meet Mr. Lopez, I must forbid her to\r\ncome at all."\r\n\r\n"You must do as you please about that. But to tell you the truth, Mr.\r\nWharton, I think the mischief is done. Such a girl as Emily, when she\r\nhas taken it into her head to love a man, is not likely to give him\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"She has promised to have nothing to say to him without my sanction."\r\n\r\n"We all know what that means. You\'ll have to give way. You\'ll find\r\nthat it will be so. The stern parent who dooms his daughter to\r\nperpetual seclusion because she won\'t marry the man he likes, doesn\'t\r\nbelong to this age."\r\n\r\n"Who talks about seclusion?"\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose that she\'ll give up the man she loves because you\r\ndon\'t like him? Is that the way girls live now-a-days? She won\'t run\r\naway with him, because she\'s not one of that sort; but unless you\'re\r\nharder-hearted than I take you to be, she\'ll make your life a burden\r\nto you. And as for betraying you, that\'s nonsense. You\'ve no right to\r\nsay it. I\'m not going to quarrel with you whatever you may say, but\r\nyou\'ve no right to say it."\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton, as he went away to Lincoln\'s Inn, bewailed himself\r\nbecause he knew that he was not hard-hearted. What his sister-in-law\r\nhad said to him in that respect was true enough. If he could only rid\r\nhimself of a certain internal ague which made him feel that his life\r\nwas, indeed, a burden to him while his daughter was unhappy, he need\r\nonly remain passive and simply not give the permission without which\r\nhis daughter would not ever engage herself to this man. But the ague\r\ntroubled every hour of his present life. That sister-in-law of his\r\nwas a silly, vulgar, worldly, and most untrustworthy woman;--but she\r\nhad understood what she was saying.\r\n\r\nAnd there had been something in that argument about the Duchess of\r\nOmnium\'s parties, and Mr. Happerton, which had its effect. If the man\r\ndid live with the great and wealthy, it must be because they thought\r\nwell of him and of his position. The fact of his being a "nasty\r\nforeigner," and probably of Jewish descent, remained. To him,\r\nWharton, the man must always be distasteful. But he could hardly\r\nmaintain his opposition to one of whom the choice spirits of the\r\nworld thought well. And he tried to be fair on the subject. It might\r\nbe that it was a prejudice. Others probably did not find a man to be\r\nodious because he was of foreign extraction and known by a foreign\r\nname. Others would not suspect a man of being of Jewish blood because\r\nhe was swarthy, or even object to him if he were a Jew by descent.\r\nBut it was wonderful to him that his girl should like such a\r\nman,--should like such a man well enough to choose him as the one\r\ncompanion of her life. She had been brought up to prefer English\r\nmen, and English thinking, and English ways,--and English ways, too,\r\nsomewhat of a past time. He thought as did Brabantio, that it could\r\nnot be that without magic his daughter who had shunned--\r\n\r\n\r\n   "The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\r\n    Would ever have, to incur a general mock,\r\n    Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom\r\n    Of such a thing as"--\r\n\r\n\r\nthis distasteful Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThat evening he said nothing further to his daughter, but sat with\r\nher, silent and disconsolate. Later in the evening, after she had\r\ngone to her room, Everett came in while the old man was still walking\r\nup and down the drawing-room. "Where have you been?" asked the\r\nfather,--not caring a straw as to any reply when he asked the\r\nquestion, but roused almost to anger by the answer when it came.\r\n\r\n"I have been dining with Lopez at the club."\r\n\r\n"I believe you live with that man."\r\n\r\n"Is there any reason, sir, why I should not?"\r\n\r\n"You know that there is a good reason why there should be no peculiar\r\nintimacy. But I don\'t suppose that my wishes, or your sister\'s\r\nwelfare, will interest you."\r\n\r\n"That is severe, sir."\r\n\r\n"I am not such a fool as to suppose that you are to quarrel with\r\na man because I don\'t approve his addressing your sister; but I\r\ndo think that while this is going on, and while he perseveres in\r\nopposition to my distinct refusal, you need not associate with him in\r\nany special manner."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand your objection to him, sir."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not. There are a great many things you don\'t understand.\r\nBut I do object."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a very rising man. Mr. Roby was saying to me just now--"\r\n\r\n"Who cares a straw what a fool like Roby says?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean Uncle Dick, but his brother,--who, I suppose, is\r\nsomebody in the world. He was saying to me just now that he wondered\r\nwhy Lopez does not go into the House;--that he would be sure to get a\r\nseat if he chose, and safe to make a mark when he got there."\r\n\r\n"I dare say he could get into the House. I don\'t know any well-to-do\r\nblackguard of whom you might not predict as much. A seat in the House\r\nof Commons doesn\'t make a man a gentleman as far as I can see."\r\n\r\n"I think every one allows that Ferdinand Lopez is a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Who was his father?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t happen to know him, sir."\r\n\r\n"And who was his mother? I don\'t suppose you will credit anything\r\nbecause I say it, but as far as my experience goes, a man doesn\'t\r\noften become a gentleman in the first generation. A man may be very\r\nworthy, very clever, very rich,--very well worth knowing, if you\r\nwill;--but when one talks of admitting a man into close family\r\ncommunion by marriage, one would, I fancy, wish to know something of\r\nhis father and mother." Then Everett escaped, and Mr. Wharton was\r\nagain left to his own meditations. Oh, what a peril, what a trouble,\r\nwhat a labyrinth of difficulties was a daughter! He must either be\r\nknown as a stern, hard-hearted parent, utterly indifferent to his\r\nchild\'s feelings, using with tyranny the power over her which came to\r\nhim only from her sense of filial duty,--or else he must give up his\r\nown judgment, and yield to her in a matter as to which he believed\r\nthat such yielding would be most pernicious to her own interests.\r\n\r\nHitherto he really knew nothing of the man\'s means;--nor, if he could\r\nhave his own way, did he want such information. But, as things were\r\ngoing now, he began to feel that if he could hear anything averse\r\nto the man he might thus strengthen his hands against him. On the\r\nfollowing day he went into the city, and called on an old friend,\r\na banker,--one whom he had known for nearly half a century, and of\r\nwhom, therefore, he was not afraid to ask a question. For Mr. Wharton\r\nwas a man not prone, in the ordinary intercourse of life, either to\r\nask or to answer questions. "You don\'t know anything, do you, of a\r\nman named Ferdinand Lopez?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard of him. But why do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Well; I have a reason for asking. I don\'t know that I quite wish to\r\nsay what my reason is."\r\n\r\n"I have heard of him as connected with Hunky\'s house," said the\r\nbanker,--"or rather with one of the partners in the house."\r\n\r\n"Is he a man of means?"\r\n\r\n"I imagine him to be so;--but I know nothing. He has rather large\r\ndealings, I take it, in foreign stocks. Is he after my old friend,\r\nMiss Wharton?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes."\r\n\r\n"You had better get more information than I can give you. But, of\r\ncourse, before anything of that kind was done you would see that\r\nmoney was settled." This was all he heard in the city, and this was\r\nnot satisfactory. He had not liked to tell his friend that he wished\r\nto hear that the foreigner was a needy adventurer,--altogether\r\nuntrustworthy; but that had really been his desire. Then he thought\r\nof the L60,000 which he himself destined for his girl. If the man\r\nwere to his liking there would be money enough. Though he had\r\nbeen careful to save money, he was not a greedy man, even for his\r\nchildren. Should his daughter insist on marrying this man he could\r\ntake care that she should never want a sufficient income.\r\n\r\nAs a first step,--a thing to be done almost at once,--he must take\r\nher away from London. It was now July, and the custom of the family\r\nwas that the house in Manchester Square should be left for two\r\nmonths, and that the flitting should take place about the middle of\r\nAugust. Mr. Wharton usually liked to postpone the flitting, as he\r\nalso liked to hasten the return. But now it was a question whether he\r\nhad not better start at once,--start somewhither, and probably for\r\na much longer period than the usual vacation. Should he take the\r\nbull by the horns, and declare his purpose of living for the next\r\ntwelvemonth at--; well, it did not much matter where; Dresden, he\r\nthought, was a long way off, and would do as well as any place. Then\r\nit occurred to him that his cousin, Sir Alured, was in town, and\r\nthat he had better see his cousin before he came to any decision.\r\nThey were, as usual, expected at Wharton Hall this autumn, and that\r\narrangement could not be abandoned without explanation.\r\n\r\nSir Alured Wharton was a baronet, with a handsome old family place on\r\nthe Wye in Herefordshire, whose forefathers had been baronets since\r\nbaronets were first created, and whose earlier forefathers had lived\r\nat Wharton Hall much before that time. It may be imagined, therefore,\r\nthat Sir Alured was proud of his name, of his estate, and of his\r\nrank. But there were drawbacks to his happiness. As regarded his\r\nname, it was to descend to a nephew whom he specially disliked,--and\r\nwith good cause. As to his estate, delightful as it was in many\r\nrespects, it was hardly sufficient to maintain his position with that\r\nplentiful hospitality which he would have loved;--and other property\r\nhe had none. And as to his rank, he had almost become ashamed of it,\r\nsince,--as he was wont to declare was now the case,--every prosperous\r\ntallow-chandler throughout the country was made a baronet as a matter\r\nof course. So he lived at home through the year with his wife and\r\ndaughters, not pretending to the luxury of a season in London for\r\nwhich his modest three or four thousand a year did not suffice;--and\r\nso living, apart from all the friction of clubs, parliaments, and\r\nmixed society, he did veritably believe that his dear country was\r\ngoing utterly to the dogs. He was so staunch in politics, that during\r\nthe doings of the last quarter of a century,--from the repeal of the\r\nCorn Laws down to the Ballot,--he had honestly declared one side to\r\nbe as bad as the other. Thus he felt that all his happiness was to be\r\ndrawn from the past. There was nothing of joy or glory to which he\r\ncould look forward either on behalf of his country or his family. His\r\nnephew,--and alas, his heir,--was a needy spendthrift, with whom he\r\nwould hold no communication. The family settlement for his wife and\r\ndaughters would leave them but poorly off; and though he did struggle\r\nto save something, the duty of living as Sir Alured Wharton of\r\nWharton Hall should live made those struggles very ineffective.\r\nHe was a melancholy, proud, ignorant man, who could not endure a\r\npersonal liberty, and who thought the assertion of social equality\r\non the part of men of lower rank to amount to the taking of personal\r\nliberty;--who read little or nothing, and thought that he knew the\r\nhistory of his country because he was aware that Charles I had had\r\nhis head cut off, and that the Georges had come from Hanover. If\r\nCharles I had never had his head cut off, and if the Georges had\r\nnever come from Hanover, the Whartons would now probably be great\r\npeople and Britain a great nation. But the Evil One had been allowed\r\nto prevail, and everything had gone astray, and Sir Alured now had\r\nnothing of this world to console him but a hazy retrospect of past\r\nglories, and a delight in the beauty of his own river, his own park,\r\nand his own house. Sir Alured, with all his foibles and with all his\r\nfaults, was a pure-minded, simple gentleman, who could not tell a\r\nlie, who could not do a wrong, and who was earnest in his desire to\r\nmake those who were dependent on him comfortable, and, if possible,\r\nhappy. Once a year he came up to London for a week, to see his\r\nlawyers, and get measured for a coat, and go to the dentist. These\r\nwere the excuses which he gave, but it was fancied by some that his\r\nwig was the great moving cause. Sir Alured and Mr. Wharton were\r\nsecond cousins, and close friends. Sir Alured trusted his cousin\r\naltogether in all things, believing him to be the great legal\r\nluminary of Great Britain, and Mr. Wharton returned his cousin\'s\r\naffection, entertaining something akin to reverence for the man who\r\nwas the head of his family. He dearly loved Sir Alured,--and loved\r\nSir Alured\'s wife and two daughters. Nevertheless, the second week at\r\nWharton Hall became always tedious to him, and the fourth, fifth, and\r\nsixth weeks frightful with ennui.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was with some unconscious dread of this tedium that he\r\nmade a sudden suggestion to Sir Alured in reference to Dresden. Sir\r\nAlured had come to him at his chambers, and the two old men were\r\nsitting together near the open window. Sir Alured delighted in the\r\nprivilege of sitting there, which seemed to confer upon him something\r\nof an insight into the inner ways of London life beyond what he could\r\nget at his hotel or his wigmaker\'s. "Go to Dresden;--for the winter!"\r\nhe exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Not only for the winter. We should go at once."\r\n\r\n"Not before you come to Wharton!" said the amazed baronet.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton replied in a low, sad voice, "In that case we should not\r\ngo down to Herefordshire at all." The baronet looked hurt as well as\r\nunhappy. "Yes, I know what you will say, and how kind you are."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t kindness at all. You always come. It would be breaking up\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"Everything has to be broken up sooner or later. One feels that as\r\none grows older."\r\n\r\n"You and I, Abel, are just of an age. Why should you talk to me like\r\nthis? You are strong enough, whatever I am. Why shouldn\'t you come?\r\nDresden! I never heard of such a thing. I suppose it\'s some nonsense\r\nof Emily\'s."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Wharton told his whole story. "Nonsense of Emily\'s!" he\r\nbegan. "Yes, it is nonsense,--worse than you think. But she doesn\'t\r\nwant to go abroad." The father\'s plaint needn\'t be repeated to the\r\nreader as it was told to the baronet. Though it was necessary that\r\nhe should explain himself, yet he tried to be reticent. Sir Alured\r\nlistened in silence. He loved his cousin Emily, and, knowing that she\r\nwould be rich, knowing her advantages of birth, and recognizing her\r\nbeauty, had expected that she would make a match creditable to the\r\nWharton family. But a Portuguese Jew! A man who had never been even\r\nknown to allude to his own father! For by degrees Mr. Wharton had\r\nbeen driven to confess all the sins of the lover, though he had\r\nendeavoured to conceal the extent of his daughter\'s love.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that Emily--favours him?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid so."\r\n\r\n"And would she--would she--do anything without your sanction?" He was\r\nalways thinking of the disgrace attaching to himself by reason of his\r\nnephew\'s vileness, and now, if a daughter of the family should also\r\ngo astray, so as to be exiled from the bosom of the Whartons, how\r\nmanifest would it be that all the glory was departing from their\r\nhouse!\r\n\r\n"No! She will do nothing without my sanction. She has given her\r\nword,--which is gospel." As he spoke the old lawyer struck his hand\r\nupon the table.\r\n\r\n"Then why should you run away to Dresden?"\r\n\r\n"Because she is unhappy. She will not marry him,--or even see him, if\r\nI forbid it. But she is near him."\r\n\r\n"Herefordshire is a long way off," said the baronet, pleading.\r\n\r\n"Change of scene is what she should have," said the father.\r\n\r\n"There can\'t be more of a change than she\'d get at Wharton. She\r\nalways did like Wharton. It was there that she met Arthur Fletcher."\r\nThe father only shook his head as Arthur Fletcher\'s name was\r\nmentioned. "Well,--that is sad. I always thought she\'d give way about\r\nArthur at last."\r\n\r\n"It is impossible to understand a young woman," said the lawyer. With\r\nsuch an English gentleman as Arthur Fletcher on one side, and with\r\nthis Portuguese Jew on the other, it was to him Hyperion to a Satyr.\r\nA darkness had fallen over his girl\'s eyes, and for a time her power\r\nof judgment had left her.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t see why Wharton should not do just as well as Dresden,"\r\ncontinued the baronet. Mr. Wharton found himself quite unable to\r\nmake his cousin understand that the greater disruption caused by\r\na residence abroad, the feeling that a new kind of life had been\r\nconsidered necessary for her, and that she must submit to the new\r\nkind of life, might be gradually effective, while the journeyings and\r\nscenes which had been common to her year after year would have no\r\neffect. Nevertheless he gave way. They could hardly start to Germany\r\nat once, but the visit to Wharton might be accelerated; and the\r\ndetails of the residence abroad might be there arranged. It was\r\nfixed, therefore, that Mr. Wharton and Emily should go down to\r\nWharton Hall at any rate before the end of July.\r\n\r\n"Why do you go earlier than usual, papa?" Emily asked him afterwards.\r\n\r\n"Because I think it best," he replied angrily. She ought at any rate\r\nto understand the reason.\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall be ready, papa. You know that I always like\r\nWharton. There is no place on earth I like so much, and this year it\r\nwill be especially pleasant to me to go out of town. But--"\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear to think that I shall be taking you away."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to bear worse things than that, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, do not speak to me like that! Of course I know what\r\nyou mean. There is no real reason for your going. If you wish it\r\nI will promise you that I will not see him." He only shook his\r\nhead,--meaning to imply that a promise which could go no farther\r\nthan that would not make him happy. "It will be just the same,\r\npapa,--either here, or at Wharton, or elsewhere. You need not be\r\nafraid of me."\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid of you;--but I am afraid for you. I fear for your\r\nhappiness,--and for my own."\r\n\r\n"So do I, papa. But what can be done? I suppose sometimes people must\r\nbe unhappy. I can\'t change myself, and I can\'t change you. I find\r\nmyself to be as much bound to Mr. Lopez as though I were his wife."\r\n\r\n"No, no! you shouldn\'t say so. You\'ve no right to say so."\r\n\r\n"But I have given you a promise, and I certainly will keep it. If\r\nwe must be unhappy, still we need not,--need not quarrel; need we,\r\npapa?" Then she came up to him and kissed him,--whereupon he went out\r\nof the room wiping his eyes.\r\n\r\nThat evening he again spoke to her, saying merely a word. "I think,\r\nmy dear, we\'ll have it fixed that we go on the 30th. Sir Alured\r\nseemed to wish it."\r\n\r\n"Very well, papa;--I shall be quite ready."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA Lover\'s Perseverance\r\n\r\n\r\nFerdinand Lopez learned immediately through Mrs. Roby that the early\r\ndeparture for Herefordshire had been fixed. "I should go to him and\r\nspeak to him very plainly," said Mrs. Roby. "He can\'t bite you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not in the least afraid of his biting me."\r\n\r\n"You can talk so well! I should tell him everything, especially about\r\nmoney,--which I\'m sure is all right."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--that is all right," said Lopez, smiling.\r\n\r\n"And about your people."\r\n\r\n"Which I\'ve no doubt you think is all wrong."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about it," said Mrs. Roby, "and I don\'t much\r\ncare. He has old-world notions. At any rate you should say something,\r\nso that he should not be able to complain to her that you had kept\r\nhim in the dark. If there is anything to be known, it\'s much better\r\nto have it known."\r\n\r\n"But there is nothing to be known."\r\n\r\n"Then tell him nothing;--but still tell it to him. After that you\r\nmust trust to her. I don\'t suppose she\'d go off with you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure she wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"But she\'s as obstinate as a mule. She\'ll get the better of him\r\nif you really mean it." He assured her that he really did mean\r\nit, and determined that he would take her advice as to seeing, or\r\nendeavouring to see, Mr. Wharton once again. But before doing so he\r\nthought it to be expedient to put his house into order, so that he\r\nmight be able to make a statement of his affairs if asked to do so.\r\nWhether they were flourishing or the reverse, it might be necessary\r\nthat he should have to speak of them,--with, at any rate, apparent\r\ncandour.\r\n\r\nThe reader may, perhaps, remember that in the month of April\r\nFerdinand Lopez had managed to extract a certain signature from his\r\nunfortunate city friend, Sexty Parker, which made that gentleman\r\nresponsible for the payment of a considerable sum of money before\r\nthe end of July. The transaction had been one of an unmixed painful\r\nnature to Mr. Parker. As soon as he came to think of it, after Lopez\r\nhad left him, he could not prevail upon himself to forgive himself\r\nfor his folly. That he,--he, Sextus Parker,--should have been induced\r\nby a few empty words to give his name for seven hundred and fifty\r\npounds without any consideration or possibility of benefit! And the\r\nmore he thought of it the more sure he was that the money was lost.\r\nThe next day he confirmed his own fears, and before a week was\r\ngone he had written down the sum as gone. He told nobody. He did\r\nnot like to confess his folly. But he made some inquiry about his\r\nfriend,--which was absolutely futile. No one that he knew seemed to\r\nknow anything of the man\'s affairs. But he saw his friend from time\r\nto time in the city, shining as only successful men do shine, and he\r\nheard of him as one whose name was becoming known in the city. Still\r\nhe suffered grievously. His money was surely gone. A man does not fly\r\na kite in that fashion till things with him have reached a bad pass.\r\n\r\nSo it was with Mr. Parker all through May and to the end of\r\nJune,--the load ever growing heavier and heavier as the time became\r\nnearer. Then, while he was still afflicted with a heaviness of\r\nspirits which had never left him since that fatal day, who but\r\nFerdinand Lopez should walk into his office, wearing the gayest smile\r\nand with a hat splendid as hats are splendid only in the city. And\r\nnothing could be more "jolly" than his friend\'s manner,--so much\r\nso that Sexty was almost lifted up into temporary jollity himself.\r\nLopez, seating himself, almost at once began to describe a certain\r\nspeculation into which he was going rather deeply, and as to which\r\nhe invited his friend Parker\'s co-operation. He was intending,\r\nevidently, not to ask, but to confer, a favour.\r\n\r\n"I rather think that steady business is best," said Parker. "I hope\r\nit\'s all right about that L750."\r\n\r\n"Ah; yes;--I meant to have told you. I didn\'t want the money, as it\r\nturned out, for much above a fortnight, and as there was no use in\r\nletting the bill run out, I settled it." So saying he took out a\r\npocket-book, extracted the bill, and showed it to Sexty. Sexty\'s\r\nheart fluttered in his bosom. There was his name still on the bit of\r\npaper, and it might still be used. Having it shown to him after this\r\nfashion in its mid career, of course he had strong ground for hope.\r\nBut he could not bring himself to put out his hand for it. "As to\r\nwhat you say about steady business, of course that\'s very well," said\r\nLopez. "It depends upon whether a man wants to make a small income or\r\na large fortune." He still held the bill as though he were going to\r\nfold it up again, and the importance of it was so present to Sexty\'s\r\nmind that he could hardly digest the argument about the steady\r\nbusiness. "I own that I am not satisfied with the former," continued\r\nLopez, "and that I go in for the fortune." As he spoke he tore the\r\nbill into three or four bits, apparently without thinking of it, and\r\nlet the fragments fall upon the floor. It was as though a mountain\r\nhad been taken off Sexty\'s bosom. He felt almost inclined to send out\r\nfor a bottle of champagne on the moment, and the arguments of his\r\nfriend rang in his ears with quite a different sound. The allurements\r\nof a steady income paled before his eyes, and he too began to tell\r\nhimself, as he had often told himself before, that if he would only\r\nkeep his eyes open and his heart high there was no reason why he too\r\nshould not become a city millionaire. But on that occasion Lopez left\r\nhim soon, without saying very much about his favourite speculation.\r\nIn a few days, however, the same matter was brought before Sexty\'s\r\neyes from another direction. He learned from a side wind that the\r\nhouse of Hunky and Sons was concerned largely in this business,--or\r\nat any rate he thought that he had so learned. The ease with which\r\nLopez had destroyed that bill six weeks before it was due had had\r\ngreat effect upon him. Those arguments about a large fortune or a\r\nsmall income still clung to him. Lopez had come to him about the\r\nbusiness in the first instance, but it was now necessary that he\r\nshould go to Lopez. He was, however, very cautious. He managed to\r\nhappen to meet Lopez in the street, and introduced the subject in his\r\nown slap-dash, aery manner,--the result of which was, that he had\r\ngone rather deep into two or three American mines before the end of\r\nJuly. But he had already made some money out of them, and, though he\r\nwould find himself sometimes trembling before he had taken his daily\r\nallowance of port wine and brandy-and-water, still he was buoyant,\r\nand hopeful of living in a park, with a palace at the West End,\r\nand a seat in Parliament. Knowing also, as he did, that his friend\r\nLopez was intimate with the Duchess of Omnium, he had much immediate\r\nsatisfaction in the intimacy which these relations created. He was\r\ngetting in the thin edge of the wedge, and would calculate as he went\r\nhome to Ponder\'s End how long it must be before he could ask his\r\nfriend to propose him at some West End club. On one halcyon summer\r\nevening Lopez had dined with him at Ponder\'s End, had smiled on Mrs.\r\nParker, and played with the hopeful little Parkers. On that occasion\r\nSexty had assured his wife that he regarded his friendship with\r\nFerdinand Lopez as the most fortunate circumstance of his life. "Do\r\nbe careful, Sexty," the poor woman had said. But Parker had simply\r\ntold her that she understood nothing about business. On that evening\r\nLopez had thoroughly imbued him with the conviction that if you will\r\nonly set your mind that way, it is quite as easy to amass a large\r\nfortune as to earn a small income.\r\n\r\nAbout a week before the departure of the Whartons for Herefordshire,\r\nLopez, in compliance with Mrs. Roby\'s counsels, called at the\r\nchambers in Stone Buildings. It is difficult to say that you will\r\nnot see a man, when the man is standing just on the other side of an\r\nopen door;--nor, in this case, was Mr. Wharton quite clear that he\r\nhad better decline to see the man. But while he was doubting,--at\r\nany rate before he had resolved upon denying his presence,--the\r\nman was there, inside his room. Mr. Wharton got up from his chair,\r\nhesitated a moment, and then gave his hand to the intruder in\r\nthat half-unwilling, unsatisfactory manner which most of us have\r\nexperienced when shaking hands with some cold-blooded, ungenial\r\nacquaintance. "Well, Mr. Lopez,--what can I do for you?" he said, as\r\nhe reseated himself. He looked as though he were at his ease and\r\nmaster of the situation. He had control over himself sufficient for\r\nassuming such a manner. But his heart was not high within his bosom.\r\nThe more he looked at the man the less he liked him.\r\n\r\n"There is one thing, and one thing only, you can do for me," said\r\nLopez. His voice was peculiarly sweet, and when he spoke his words\r\nseemed to mean more than when they came from other mouths. But Mr.\r\nWharton did not like sweet voices and mellow, soft words,--at least\r\nnot from men\'s mouths.\r\n\r\n"I do not think that I can do anything for you, Mr. Lopez," he said.\r\nThere was a slight pause, during which the visitor put down his hat\r\nand seemed to hesitate. "I think your coming here can be of no avail.\r\nDid I not explain myself when I saw you before?"\r\n\r\n"But, I fear, I did not explain myself. I hardly told my story."\r\n\r\n"You can tell it, of course,--if you think the telling will do you\r\nany good."\r\n\r\n"I was not able to say then, as I can say now, that your daughter has\r\naccepted my love."\r\n\r\n"You ought not to have spoken to my daughter on the subject after\r\nwhat passed between us. I told you my mind frankly."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Mr. Wharton, how was obedience in such a matter possible? What\r\nwould you yourself think of a man who in such a position would be\r\nobedient? I did not seek her secretly. I did nothing underhand.\r\nBefore I had once directly asked her for her love, I came to you."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of that, if you go to her immediately afterwards in\r\nmanifest opposition to my wishes? You found yourself bound, as would\r\nany gentleman, to ask a father\'s leave, and when it was refused, you\r\nwent on just as though it had been granted! Don\'t you call that a\r\nmockery?"\r\n\r\n"I can say now, sir, what I could not say then. We love each other.\r\nAnd I am as sure of her as I am of myself when I assert that we shall\r\nbe true to each other. You must know her well enough to be sure of\r\nthat also."\r\n\r\n"I am sure of nothing but of this;--that I will not give her my\r\nconsent to become your wife."\r\n\r\n"What is your objection, Mr. Wharton?"\r\n\r\n"I explained it before as far as I found myself called upon to\r\nexplain it."\r\n\r\n"Are we both to be sacrificed for some reason that we neither of us\r\nunderstand?"\r\n\r\n"How dare you take upon yourself to say that she doesn\'t understand!\r\nBecause I refuse to be more explicit to you, a stranger, do you\r\nsuppose that I am equally silent to my own child?"\r\n\r\n"In regard to money and social rank I am able to place your daughter\r\nas my wife in a position as good as she now holds as Miss Wharton."\r\n\r\n"I care nothing about money, Mr. Lopez, and our ideas of social rank\r\nare perhaps different. I have nothing further to say to you, and I do\r\nnot think that you can have anything further to say to me that can be\r\nof any avail." Then, having finished his speech, he got up from his\r\nchair and stood upright, thereby demanding of his visitor that he\r\nshould depart.\r\n\r\n"I think it no more than honest, Mr. Wharton, to declare this one\r\nthing. I regard myself as irrevocably engaged to your daughter; and\r\nshe, although she has refused to bind herself to me by that special\r\nword, is, I am certain, as firmly fixed in her choice as I am in\r\nmine. My happiness, as a matter of course, can be nothing to you."\r\n\r\n"Not much," said the lawyer, with angry impatience.\r\n\r\nLopez smiled, but he put down the word in his memory and determined\r\nthat he would treasure it there. "Not much, at any rate as yet," he\r\nsaid. "But her happiness must be much to you."\r\n\r\n"It is everything. But in thinking of her happiness I must look\r\nbeyond what might be the satisfaction of the present day. You must\r\nexcuse me, Mr. Lopez, if I say that I would rather not discuss the\r\nmatter with you any further." Then he rang the bell and passed\r\nquickly into an inner room. When the clerk came Lopez of course\r\nmarched out of the chambers and went his way.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton had been very firm, and yet he was shaken. It was by\r\ndegrees becoming a fixed idea in his mind that the man\'s material\r\nprosperity was assured. He was afraid even to allude to the subject\r\nwhen talking to the man himself, lest he should be overwhelmed by\r\nevidence on that subject. Then the man\'s manner, though it was\r\ndistasteful to Wharton himself, would, he well knew, recommend him\r\nto others. He was good-looking, he lived with people who were highly\r\nregarded, he could speak up for himself, and he was a favoured guest\r\nat Carlton House Terrace. So great had been the fame of the Duchess\r\nand her hospitality during the last two months, that the fact of the\r\nman\'s success in this respect had come home even to Mr. Wharton. He\r\nfeared that the world would be against him, and he already began to\r\ndread the joint opposition of the world and his own child. The world\r\nof this day did not, he thought, care whether its daughters\' husbands\r\nhad or had not any fathers or mothers. The world as it was now didn\'t\r\ncare whether its sons-in-law were Christian or Jewish;--whether they\r\nhad the fair skin and bold eyes and uncertain words of an English\r\ngentleman, or the swarthy colour and false grimace and glib tongue of\r\nsome inferior Latin race. But he cared for these things;--and it was\r\ndreadful to him to think that his daughter should not care for them.\r\n"I suppose I had better die and leave them to look after themselves,"\r\nhe said, as he returned to his arm-chair.\r\n\r\nLopez himself was not altogether ill-satisfied with the interview,\r\nnot having expected that Mr. Wharton would have given way at once,\r\nand bestowed upon him then and there the kind father-in-law\'s "bless\r\nyou,--bless you!" Something yet had to be done before the blessing\r\nwould come, or the girl,--or the money. He had to-day asserted his\r\nown material success, speaking of himself as of a moneyed man,--and\r\nthe statement had been received with no contradiction,--even without\r\nthe suggestion of a doubt. He did not therefore suppose that the\r\ndifficulty was over; but he was clever enough to perceive that the\r\naversion to him on another score might help to tide him over that\r\ndifficulty. And if once he could call the girl his wife, he did not\r\ndoubt but that he could build himself up with the old barrister\'s\r\nmoney. After leaving Lincoln\'s Inn he went at once to Berkeley\r\nStreet, and was soon closeted with Mrs. Roby. "You can get her here\r\nbefore they go?" he said.\r\n\r\n"She wouldn\'t come;--and if we arranged it without letting her know\r\nthat you were to be here, she would tell her father. She hasn\'t a\r\nparticle of female intrigue in her."\r\n\r\n"So much the better," said the lover.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well for you to say, but when a man makes such a\r\ntyrant of himself as Mr. Wharton is doing, a girl is bound to look\r\nafter herself. If it was me I\'d go off with my young man before I\'d\r\nstand such treatment."\r\n\r\n"You could give her a letter."\r\n\r\n"She\'d only show it her father. She is so perverse that I sometimes\r\nfeel inclined to say that I\'ll have nothing further to do with her."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll give her a message at any rate?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--I can do that;--because I can do it in a way that won\'t seem\r\nto make it important."\r\n\r\n"But I want my message to be very important. Tell her that I\'ve seen\r\nher father, and have offered to explain all my affairs to him,--so\r\nthat he may know that there is nothing to fear on her behalf."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t any thought of money that is troubling him."\r\n\r\n"But tell her what I say. He, however, would listen to nothing. Then\r\nI assured him that no consideration on earth would induce me to\r\nsurrender her, and that I was as sure of her as I am of myself. Tell\r\nher that;--and tell her that I think she owes it to me to say one\r\nword to me before she goes into the country."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nArthur Fletcher\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may, I think, be a question whether the two old men acted wisely\r\nin having Arthur Fletcher at Wharton Hall when Emily arrived there.\r\nThe story of his love for Miss Wharton, as far as it had as yet gone,\r\nmust be shortly told. He had been the second son, as he was now the\r\nsecond brother, of a Herefordshire squire endowed with much larger\r\nproperty than that belonging to Sir Alured. John Fletcher, Esq., of\r\nLongbarns, some twelve miles from Wharton, was a considerable man in\r\nHerefordshire. This present squire had married Sir Alured\'s eldest\r\ndaughter, and the younger brother had, almost since they were\r\nchildren together, been known to be in love with Emily Wharton. All\r\nthe Fletchers and everything belonging to them were almost worshipped\r\nat Wharton Hall. There had been marriages between the two families\r\ncertainly as far back as the time of Henry VII, and they were\r\naccustomed to speak, if not of alliances, at any rate of friendships,\r\nmuch anterior to that. As regards family, therefore, the pretensions\r\nof a Fletcher would always be held to be good by a Wharton. But this\r\nFletcher was the very pearl of the Fletcher tribe. Though a younger\r\nbrother, he had a very pleasant little fortune of his own. Though\r\nborn to comfortable circumstances, he had worked so hard in his young\r\ndays as to have already made for himself a name at the bar. He was\r\na fair-haired, handsome fellow, with sharp, eager eyes, with an\r\naquiline nose, and just that shape of mouth and chin which such men\r\nas Abel Wharton regarded as characteristic of good blood. He was\r\nrather thin, about five feet ten in height, and had the character of\r\nbeing one of the best horsemen in the county. He was one of the most\r\npopular men in Herefordshire, and at Longbarns was almost as much\r\nthought of as the squire himself. He certainly was not the man to be\r\ntaken, from his appearance, for a forlorn lover. He looked like one\r\nof those happy sons of the gods who are born to success. No young\r\nman of his age was more courted both by men and women. There was no\r\none who in his youth had suffered fewer troubles from those causes\r\nof trouble which visit English young men,--occasional impecuniosity,\r\nsternness of parents, native shyness, fear of ridicule, inability of\r\nspeech, and a general pervading sense of inferiority combined with\r\nan ardent desire to rise to a feeling of conscious superiority. So\r\nmuch had been done for him by nature that he was never called upon\r\nto pretend to anything. Throughout the county those were the lucky\r\nmen,--and those too were the happy girls,--who were allowed to call\r\nhim Arthur. And yet this paragon was vainly in love with Emily\r\nWharton, who, in the way of love, would have nothing to say to him,\r\npreferring,--as her father once said in his extremest wrath,--a\r\ngreasy Jew adventurer out of the gutter!\r\n\r\nAnd now it had been thought expedient to have him down to Wharton,\r\nalthough the lawyers\' regular summer vacation had not yet commenced.\r\nBut there was some excuse made for this, over and above the emergency\r\nof his own love, in the fact that his brother John, with Mrs.\r\nFletcher, was also to be at the Hall,--so that there was gathered\r\nthere a great family party of the Whartons and Fletchers; for\r\nthere was present there also old Mrs. Fletcher, a magnificently\r\naristocratic and high-minded old lady, with snow-white hair, and lace\r\nworth fifty guineas a yard, who was as anxious as everybody else that\r\nher younger son should marry Emily Wharton. Something of the truth\r\nas to Emily Wharton\'s L60,000 was, of course, known to the Longbarns\r\npeople. Not that I would have it inferred that they wanted their\r\ndarling to sell himself for money. The Fletchers were great people,\r\nwith great spirits, too good in every way for such baseness. But when\r\nlove, old friendship, good birth, together with every other propriety\r\nas to age, manners, and conduct, can be joined to money, such a\r\ncombination will always be thought pleasant.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur reached the Hall it was felt to be necessary that a word\r\nshould be said to him as to that wretched interloper, Ferdinand\r\nLopez. Arthur had not of late been often in Manchester Square. Though\r\nalways most cordially welcomed there by old Wharton, and treated\r\nwith every kindness by Emily Wharton short of that love which he\r\ndesired, he had during the last three or four months abstained from\r\nfrequenting the house. During the past winter, and early in the\r\nspring, he had pressed his suit,--but had been rejected, with warmest\r\nassurances of all friendship short of love. It had then been arranged\r\nbetween him and the elder Whartons that they should all meet down at\r\nthe Hall, and there had been sympathetic expressions of hope that all\r\nmight yet be well. But at that time little or nothing had been known\r\nof Ferdinand Lopez.\r\n\r\nBut now the old baronet spoke to him, the father having deputed the\r\nloathsome task to his friend,--being unwilling himself even to hint\r\nhis daughter\'s disgrace. "Oh, yes, I\'ve heard of him," said Arthur\r\nFletcher. "I met him with Everett, and I don\'t think I ever took\r\na stronger dislike to a man. Everett seems very fond of him." The\r\nbaronet mournfully shook his head. It was sad to find that Whartons\r\ncould go so far astray. "He goes to Carlton Terrace,--to the\r\nDuchess\'s," continued the young man.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that that is very much in his favour," said the\r\nbaronet.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that it is, sir;--only they try to catch all fish in\r\nthat net that are of any use."\r\n\r\n"Do you go there, Arthur?"\r\n\r\n"I should if I were asked, I suppose. I don\'t know who wouldn\'t. You\r\nsee it\'s a Coalition affair, so that everybody is able to feel that\r\nhe is supporting his party by going to the Duchess\'s."\r\n\r\n"I hate Coalitions," said the baronet. "I think they are\r\ndisgraceful."\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes; I don\'t know. The coach has to be driven somehow. You\r\nmustn\'t stick in the mud, you know. And after all, sir, the Duke of\r\nOmnium is a respectable man, though he is a Liberal. A Duke of Omnium\r\ncan\'t want to send the country to the dogs." The old man shook his\r\nhead. He did not understand much about it, but he felt convinced that\r\nthe Duke and his colleagues were sending the country to the dogs,\r\nwhatever might be their wishes. "I shan\'t think of politics for the\r\nnext ten years, and so I don\'t trouble myself about the Duchess\'s\r\nparties, but I suppose I should go if I were asked."\r\n\r\nSir Alured felt that he had not as yet begun even to approach the\r\ndifficult subject. "I\'m glad you don\'t like that man," he said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like him at all. Tell me, Sir Alured;--why is he always\r\ngoing to Manchester Square?"\r\n\r\n"Ah;--that is it."\r\n\r\n"He has been there constantly;--has he not?"\r\n\r\n"No;--no. I don\'t think that. Mr. Wharton doesn\'t love him a bit\r\nbetter than you do. My cousin thinks him a most objectionable young\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"But Emily?"\r\n\r\n"Ah--. That\'s where it is."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say she--cares about that man!"\r\n\r\n"He has been encouraged by that aunt of hers, who, as far as I can\r\nmake out, is a very unfit sort of person to be much with such a girl\r\nas our dear Emily. I never saw her but once, and then I didn\'t like\r\nher at all."\r\n\r\n"A vulgar, good-natured woman. But what can she have done? She can\'t\r\nhave twisted Emily round her finger."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose there is very much in it, but I thought it better to\r\ntell you. Girls take fancies into their heads,--just for a time."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a handsome fellow, too," said Arthur Fletcher, musing in his\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\n"My cousin says he\'s a nasty Jew-looking man."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not that, Sir Alured. He\'s a handsome man, with a fine\r\nvoice;--dark, and not just like an Englishman; but still I can\r\nfancy--. That\'s bad news for me, Sir Alured."\r\n\r\n"I think she\'ll forget all about him down here."\r\n\r\n"She never forgets anything. I shall ask her, straight away. She\r\nknows my feeling about her, and I haven\'t a doubt but she\'ll tell me.\r\nShe\'s too honest to be able to lie. Has he got any money?"\r\n\r\n"My cousin seems to think that he\'s rich."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he is. Oh, Lord! That\'s a blow. I wish I could have the\r\npleasure of shooting him as a man might a few years ago. But what\r\nwould be the good? The girl would only hate me the more after it. The\r\nbest thing to do would be to shoot myself."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk like that, Arthur."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t throw up the sponge as long as there\'s a chance left, Sir\r\nAlured. But it will go badly with me if I\'m beat at last. I shouldn\'t\r\nhave thought it possible that I should have felt anything so much."\r\nThen he pulled his hair, and thrust his hand into his waistcoat; and\r\nturned away, so that his old friend might not see the tear in his\r\neye.\r\n\r\nHis old friend also was much moved. It was dreadful to him that the\r\nhappiness of a Fletcher, and the comfort of the Whartons generally,\r\nshould be marred by a man with such a name as Ferdinand Lopez.\r\n"She\'ll never marry him without her father\'s consent," said Sir\r\nAlured.\r\n\r\n"If she means it, of course he\'ll consent."\r\n\r\n"That I\'m sure he won\'t. He doesn\'t like the man a bit better than\r\nyou do." Fletcher shook his head. "And he\'s as fond of you as though\r\nyou were already his son."\r\n\r\n"What does it matter? If a girl sets her heart on marrying a man, of\r\ncourse she will marry him. If he had no money it might be different.\r\nBut if he\'s well off, of course he\'ll succeed. Well--; I suppose\r\nother men have borne the same sort of thing before and it hasn\'t\r\nkilled them."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope, my boy. I think of her quite as much as of you."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--we can hope. I shan\'t give it up. As for her, I dare say\r\nshe knows what will suit her best. I\'ve nothing to say against the\r\nman,--excepting that I should like to cut him into four quarters."\r\n\r\n"But a foreigner!"\r\n\r\n"Girls don\'t think about that,--not as you do and Mr. Wharton. And I\r\nthink they like dark, greasy men with slippery voices, who are up to\r\ndodges and full of secrets. Well, sir, I shall go to her at once and\r\nhave it out."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll speak to my cousin?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I will. He has always been one of the best friends I ever\r\nhad in my life. I know it hasn\'t been his fault. But what can a man\r\ndo? Girls won\'t marry this man or that because they\'re told."\r\n\r\nFletcher did speak to Emily\'s father, and learned more from him than\r\nhad been told him by Sir Alured. Indeed he learned the whole truth.\r\nLopez had been twice with the father pressing his suit and had been\r\ntwice repulsed, with as absolute denial as words could convey. Emily,\r\nhowever, had declared her own feeling openly, expressing her wish to\r\nmarry the odious man, promising not to do so without her father\'s\r\nconsent, but evidently feeling that that consent ought not to be\r\nwithheld from her. All this Mr. Wharton told very plainly, walking\r\nwith Arthur a little before dinner along a shaded, lonely path, which\r\nfor half a mile ran along the very marge of the Wye at the bottom of\r\nthe park. And then he went on to speak other words which seemed to\r\nrob his young friend of all hope. The old man was walking slowly,\r\nwith his hands clasped behind his back and with his eyes fixed on the\r\npath as he went;--and he spoke slowly, evidently weighing his words\r\nas he uttered them, bringing home to his hearer a conviction that the\r\nmatter discussed was one of supreme importance to the speaker,--as to\r\nwhich he had thought much, so as to be able to express his settled\r\nresolutions. "I\'ve told you all now, Arthur;--only this. I do not\r\nknow how long I may be able to resist this man\'s claim if it be\r\nbacked by Emily\'s entreaties. I am thinking very much about it. I do\r\nnot know that I have really been able to think of anything else for\r\nthe last two months. It is all the world to me,--what she and Everett\r\ndo with themselves; and what she may do in this matter of marriage\r\nis of infinitely greater importance than anything that can befall\r\nhim. If he makes a mistake, it may be put right. But with a woman\'s\r\nmarrying--, vestigia nulla retrorsum. She has put off all her old\r\nbonds and taken new ones, which must be her bonds for life. Feeling\r\nthis very strongly, and disliking this man greatly,--disliking him,\r\nthat is to say, in the view of this close relation,--I have felt\r\nmyself to be justified in so far opposing my child by the use of a\r\nhigh hand. I have refused my sanction to the marriage both to him and\r\nto her,--though in truth I have been hard set to find any adequate\r\nreason for doing so. I have no right to fashion my girl\'s life by my\r\nprejudices. My life has been lived. Hers is to come. In this matter I\r\nshould be cruel and unnatural were I to allow myself to be governed\r\nby any selfish inclination. Though I were to know that she would\r\nbe lost to me for ever, I must give way,--if once brought to a\r\nconviction that by not giving way I should sacrifice her young\r\nhappiness. In this matter, Arthur, I must not even think of you,\r\nthough I love you well. I must consider only my child\'s welfare;--and\r\nin doing so I must try to sift my own feelings and my own judgment,\r\nand ascertain, if it be possible, whether my distaste to the man is\r\nreasonable or irrational;--whether I should serve her or sacrifice\r\nher by obstinacy of refusal. I can speak to you more plainly than to\r\nher. Indeed I have laid bare to you my whole heart and my whole mind.\r\nYou have all my wishes, but you will understand that I do not promise\r\nyou my continued assistance." When he had so spoken he put out his\r\nhand and pressed his companion\'s arm. Then he turned slowly into a\r\nlittle by-path which led across the park up to the house, and left\r\nArthur Fletcher standing alone by the river\'s bank.\r\n\r\nAnd so by degrees the blow had come full home to him. He had been\r\ntwice refused. Then rumours had reached him,--not at first that he\r\nhad a rival, but that there was a man who might possibly become so.\r\nAnd now this rivalry, and its success, were declared to him plainly.\r\nHe told himself from this moment that he had not a chance. Looking\r\nforward he could see it all. He understood the girl\'s character\r\nsufficiently to be sure that she would not be wafted about, from one\r\nlover to another, by change of scene. Taking her to Dresden,--or to\r\nNew Zealand,--would only confirm in her passion such a girl as Emily\r\nWharton. Nothing could shake her but the ascertained unworthiness of\r\nthe man,--and not that unless it were ascertained beneath her own\r\neyes. And then years must pass by before she would yield to another\r\nlover. There was a further question, too, which he did not fail to\r\nask himself. Was the man necessarily unworthy because his name was\r\nLopez, and because he had not come of English blood?\r\n\r\nAs he strove to think of this, if not coolly yet rationally, he sat\r\nhimself down on the river\'s side and began to pitch stones off the\r\npath in among the rocks, among which at that spot the water made\r\nits way rapidly. There had been moments in which he had been almost\r\nashamed of his love,--and now he did not know whether to be most\r\nashamed or most proud of it. But he recognised the fact that it was\r\ncrucifying him, and that it would continue to crucify him. He knew\r\nhimself in London to be a popular man,--one of those for whom,\r\naccording to general opinion, girls should sigh, rather than one who\r\nshould break his heart sighing for a girl. He had often told himself\r\nthat it was beneath his manliness to be despondent; that he should\r\nlet such a trouble run from him like water from a duck\'s back,\r\nconsoling himself with the reflection that if the girl had such bad\r\ntaste she could hardly be worthy of him. He had almost tried to\r\nbelong to that school which throws the heart away and rules by the\r\nhead alone. He knew that others,--perhaps not those who knew him\r\nbest, but who nevertheless were the companions of many of his\r\nhours,--gave him the credit for such power. Why should a man afflict\r\nhimself by the inward burden of an unsatisfied craving, and allow his\r\nheart to sink into his very feet because a girl would not smile when\r\nhe wooed her? "If she be not fair for me, what care I how fair she\r\nbe!" He had repeated the lines to himself a score of times, and had\r\nbeen ashamed of himself because he could not make them come true to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThey had not come true in the least. There he was, Arthur Fletcher,\r\nwhom all the world courted, with his heart in his very boots! There\r\nwas a miserable load within him, absolutely palpable to his outward\r\nfeeling,--a very physical pain,--which he could not shake off. As he\r\nthrew the stones into the water he told himself that it must be so\r\nwith him always. Though the world did pet him, though he was liked at\r\nhis club, and courted in the hunting-field, and loved at balls and\r\narchery meetings, and reputed by old men to be a rising star, he told\r\nhimself that he was so maimed and mutilated as to be only half a man.\r\nHe could not reason about it. Nature had afflicted him with a certain\r\nweakness. One man has a hump;--another can hardly see out of his\r\nimperfect eyes;--a third can barely utter a few disjointed words.\r\nIt was his fate to be constructed with some weak arrangement of the\r\nblood-vessels which left him in this plight. "The whole damned thing\r\nis nothing to me," he said bursting out into absolute tears, after\r\nvainly trying to reassure himself by a recollection of the good\r\nthings which the world still had in store for him.\r\n\r\nThen he strove to console himself by thinking that he might take a\r\npride in his love even though it were so intolerable a burden to\r\nhim. Was it not something to be able to love as he loved? Was it not\r\nsomething at any rate that she to whom he had condescended to stoop\r\nwas worthy of all love? But even here he could get no comfort,--being\r\nin truth unable to see very clearly into the condition of the thing.\r\nIt was a disgrace to him,--to him within his own bosom,--that she\r\nshould have preferred to him such a one as Ferdinand Lopez, and this\r\ndisgrace he exaggerated, ignoring the fact that the girl herself\r\nmight be deficient in judgment, or led away in her love by falsehood\r\nand counterfeit attractions. To him she was such a goddess that she\r\nmust be right,--and therefore his own inferiority to such a one as\r\nFerdinand Lopez was proved. He could take no pride in his rejected\r\nlove. He would rid himself of it at a moment\'s notice if he knew the\r\nway. He would throw himself at the feet of some second-rate, tawdry,\r\nwell-born, well-known beauty of the day,--only that there was not now\r\nleft to him strength to pretend the feeling that would be necessary.\r\nThen he heard steps, and jumping up from his seat, stood just in the\r\nway of Emily Wharton and her cousin Mary. "Ain\'t you going to dress\r\nfor dinner, young man?" said the latter.\r\n\r\n"I shall have time if you have, any way," said Arthur, endeavouring\r\nto pluck up his spirits.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nice of him;--isn\'t it?" said Mary. "Why, we are dressed.\r\nWhat more do you want? We came out to look for you, though we didn\'t\r\nmean to come as far as this. It\'s past seven now, and we are supposed\r\nto dine at a quarter past."\r\n\r\n"Five minutes will do for me."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve got to get to the house. You needn\'t be in a tremendous\r\nhurry, because papa has only just come in from haymaking. They\'ve got\r\nup the last load, and there has been the usual ceremony. Emily and I\r\nhave been looking at them."\r\n\r\n"I wish I\'d been here all the time," said Emily. "I do so hate London\r\nin July."\r\n\r\n"So do I," said Arthur,--"in July and all other times."\r\n\r\n"You hate London!" said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--and Herefordshire,--and other places generally. If I\'ve got to\r\ndress I\'d better get across the park as quick as I can go," and so\r\nhe left them. Mary turned round and looked at her cousin, but at the\r\nmoment said nothing. Arthur\'s passion was well known to Mary Wharton,\r\nbut Mary had as yet heard nothing of Ferdinand Lopez.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nNever Run Away!\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of that evening there was a forced attempt on the\r\npart of all the party at Wharton Hall to be merry,--which, however,\r\nas is the case whenever such attempts are forced, was a failure.\r\nThere had been a hay-making harvest-home which was supposed to give\r\nthe special occasion for mirth, as Sir Alured farmed the land around\r\nthe park himself, and was great in hay. "I don\'t think it pays very\r\nwell," he said with a gentle smile, "but I like to employ some of the\r\npeople myself. I think the old people find it easier with me than\r\nwith the tenants."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder," said his cousin;--"but that\'s charity; not\r\nemployment."\r\n\r\n"No, no," exclaimed the baronet. "They work for their wages and do\r\ntheir best. Powell sees to that." Powell was the bailiff, who knew\r\nthe length of his master\'s foot to a quarter of an inch, and was\r\nquite aware that the Wharton haymakers were not to be overtasked.\r\n"Powell doesn\'t keep any cats about the place, but what catch mice.\r\nBut I am not quite sure that haymaking does pay."\r\n\r\n"How do the tenants manage?"\r\n\r\n"Of course they look to things closer. You wouldn\'t wish me to let\r\nthe land up to the house door."\r\n\r\n"I think," said old Mrs. Fletcher, "that a landlord should consent\r\nto lose a little by his own farming. It does good in the long run."\r\nBoth Mr. Wharton and Sir Alured felt that this might be very well at\r\nLongbarns, though it could hardly be afforded at Wharton.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I lose much by my farming," said the squire of\r\nLongbarns. "I have about four hundred acres on hand, and I keep my\r\naccounts pretty regularly."\r\n\r\n"Johnson is a very good man, I dare say," said the baronet.\r\n\r\n"Like most of the others," continued the squire, "he\'s very well\r\nas long as he\'s looked after. I think I know as much about it as\r\nJohnson. Of course, I don\'t expect a farmer\'s profit; but I do expect\r\nmy rent, and I get it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I manage it quite that way," said the baronet in a\r\nmelancholy tone.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not," said the barrister.\r\n\r\n"John is as hard upon the men as any one of the tenants," said John\'s\r\nwife, Mrs. Fletcher of Longbarns.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not hard at all," said John, "and you understand nothing about\r\nit. I\'m paying three shillings a week more to every man, and eighteen\r\npence a week more to every woman, than I did three years ago."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because of the Unions," said the barrister.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a straw for the Unions. If the Unions interfered with\r\nmy comfort I\'d let the land and leave the place."\r\n\r\n"Oh, John!" ejaculated John\'s mother.\r\n\r\n"I would not consent to be made a slave even for the sake of the\r\ncountry. But the wages had to be raised,--and having raised them I\r\nexpect to get proper value for my money. If anything has to be given\r\naway, let it be given away,--so that the people should know what it\r\nis that they receive."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what we don\'t want to do here," said Lady Wharton, who\r\ndid not often join in any of these arguments.\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong, my lady," said her stepson. "You\'re only breeding\r\nidleness when you teach people to think that they are earning wages\r\nwithout working for their money. Whatever you do with \'em let \'em\r\nknow and feel the truth. It\'ll be the best in the long run."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sometimes happy when I think that I shan\'t live to see the long\r\nrun," said the baronet. This was the manner in which they tried to\r\nbe merry that evening after dinner at Wharton Hall. The two girls\r\nsat listening to their seniors in contented silence,--listening\r\nor perhaps thinking of their own peculiar troubles, while Arthur\r\nFletcher held some book in his hand which he strove to read with all\r\nhis might.\r\n\r\nThere was not one there in the room who did not know that it was the\r\nwish of the united families that Arthur Fletcher should marry Emily\r\nWharton, and also that Emily had refused him. To Arthur of course the\r\nfeeling that it was so could not but be an additional vexation; but\r\nthe knowledge had grown up and had become common in the two families\r\nwithout any power on his part to prevent so disagreeable a condition\r\nof affairs. There was not one in that room, unless it was Mary\r\nWharton, who was not more or less angry with Emily, thinking her\r\nto be perverse and unreasonable. Even to Mary her cousin\'s strange\r\nobstinacy was matter of surprise and sorrow,--for to her Arthur\r\nFletcher was one of those demigods, who should never be refused, who\r\nare not expected to do more than express a wish and be accepted. Her\r\nown heart had not strayed that way because she thought but little of\r\nherself, knowing herself to be portionless, and believing from long\r\nthought on the subject that it was not her destiny to be the wife of\r\nany man. She regarded Arthur Fletcher as being of all men the most\r\nlovable,--though, knowing her own condition, she did not dream of\r\nloving him. It did not become her to be angry with another girl on\r\nsuch a cause;--but she was amazed that Arthur Fletcher should sigh in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nThe girl\'s folly and perverseness on this head were known to them\r\nall,--but as yet her greater folly and worse perverseness, her\r\nvitiated taste and dreadful partiality for the Portuguese adventurer,\r\nwere known but to the two old men and to poor Arthur himself. When\r\nthat sternly magnificent old lady, Mrs. Fletcher,--whose ancestors\r\nhad been Welsh kings in the time of the Romans,--when she should hear\r\nthis story, the roof of the old hall would hardly be able to hold her\r\nwrath and her dismay! The old kings had died away, but the Fletchers,\r\nand the Vaughans,--of whom she had been one,--and the Whartons\r\nremained, a peculiar people in an age that was then surrendering\r\nitself to quick perdition, and with peculiar duties. Among these\r\nduties, the chiefest of them incumbent on females was that of so\r\nrestraining their affections that they should never damage the good\r\ncause by leaving it. They might marry within the pale,--or remain\r\nsingle, as might be their lot. She would not take upon herself to\r\nsay that Emily Wharton was bound to accept Arthur Fletcher, merely\r\nbecause such a marriage was fitting,--although she did think that\r\nthere was much perverseness in the girl, who might have taught\r\nherself, had she not been stubborn, to comply with the wishes of the\r\nfamilies. But to love one below herself, a man without a father, a\r\nforeigner, a black Portuguese nameless Jew, merely because he had a\r\nbright eye, and a hook nose, and a glib tongue,--that a girl from the\r\nWhartons should do this--! It was so unnatural to Mrs. Fletcher that\r\nit would be hardly possible to her to be civil to the girl after she\r\nhad heard that her mind and taste were so astray. All this Sir Alured\r\nknew and the barrister knew it,--and they feared her indignation the\r\nmore because they sympathised with the old lady\'s feelings.\r\n\r\n"Emily Wharton doesn\'t seem to me to be a bit more gracious than she\r\nused to be," Mrs. Fletcher said to Lady Wharton that night. The two\r\nold ladies were sitting together upstairs, and Mrs. John Fletcher was\r\nwith them. In such conferences Mrs. Fletcher always domineered,--to\r\nthe perfect contentment of old Lady Wharton, but not equally so to\r\nthat of her daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid she is not very happy," said Lady Wharton.\r\n\r\n"She has everything that ought to make a girl happy, and I don\'t\r\nknow what it is she wants. It makes me quite angry to see her so\r\ndiscontented. She doesn\'t say a word, but sits there as glum as\r\ndeath. If I were Arthur I would leave her for six months, and never\r\nspeak to her during the time."\r\n\r\n"I suppose, mother," said the younger Mrs. Fletcher,--who called her\r\nhusband\'s mother, mother, and her own mother, mamma,--"a girl needn\'t\r\nmarry a man unless she likes him."\r\n\r\n"But she should try to like him if it is suitable in other respects.\r\nI don\'t mean to take any trouble about it. Arthur needn\'t beg for any\r\nfavour. Only I wouldn\'t have come here if I had thought that she had\r\nintended to sit silent like that always."\r\n\r\n"It makes her unhappy, I suppose," said Lady Wharton, "because she\r\ncan\'t do what we all want."\r\n\r\n"Fall, lall! She\'d have wanted it herself if nobody else had wished\r\nit. I\'m surprised that Arthur should be so much taken with her."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better say nothing more about it, mother."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to say anything more about it. It\'s nothing to me.\r\nArthur can do very well in the world without Emily Wharton. Only a\r\ngirl like that will sometimes make a disgraceful match; and we should\r\nall feel that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Emily will do anything disgraceful," said Lady\r\nWharton. And so they parted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the two brothers were smoking their pipes in the\r\nhousekeeper\'s room, which, at Wharton, when the Fletchers or Everett\r\nwere there, was freely used for that purpose.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it rather quaint of you," said the elder brother, "coming down\r\nhere in the middle of term time?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter much."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought it would matter;--that is, if you mean to go\r\non with it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to make a slave of myself about it, if you mean that.\r\nI don\'t suppose I shall ever marry,--and as for rising to be a swell\r\nin the profession, I don\'t care about it."\r\n\r\n"You used to care about it,--very much. You used to say that if you\r\ndidn\'t get to the top it shouldn\'t be your own fault."\r\n\r\n"And I have worked;--and I do work. But things get changed somehow.\r\nI\'ve half a mind to give it all up,--to raise a lot of money, and\r\nto start off with a resolution to see every corner of the world. I\r\nsuppose a man could do it in about thirty years if he lived so long.\r\nIt\'s the kind of thing would suit me."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. I don\'t know any fellow who has been more into society,\r\nand therefore you are exactly the man to live alone for the rest of\r\nyour life. You\'ve always worked hard, I will say that for you;--and\r\ntherefore you\'re just the man to be contented with idleness. You\'ve\r\nalways been ambitious and self-confident, and therefore it will\r\nsuit you to a T, to be nobody and to do nothing." Arthur sat\r\nsilent, smoking his pipe with all his might, and his brother\r\ncontinued,--"Besides,--you read sometimes, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"I should read all the more."\r\n\r\n"Very likely. But what you have read, in the old plays, for instance,\r\nmust have taught you that when a man is cut up about a woman,--which\r\nI suppose is your case just at present,--he never does get over\r\nit. He never gets all right after a time,--does he? Such a one\r\nhad better go and turn monk at once, as the world is over for him\r\naltogether;--isn\'t it? Men don\'t recover after a month or two, and go\r\non just the same. You\'ve never seen that kind of thing yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to cut my throat or turn monk either."\r\n\r\n"No. There are so many steamboats and railways now that travelling\r\nseems easier. Suppose you go as far as St. Petersburg, and see if\r\nthat does you any good. If it don\'t, you needn\'t go on, because it\r\nwill be hopeless. If it does,--why, you can come back, because the\r\nsecond journey will do the rest."\r\n\r\n"There never was anything, John, that wasn\'t matter for chaff with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"And I hope there never will be. People understand it when logic\r\nwould be thrown away. I suppose the truth is the girl cares for\r\nsomebody else." Arthur nodded his head. "Who is it? Any one I know?"\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"Any one you know?"\r\n\r\n"I have met the man."\r\n\r\n"Decent?"\r\n\r\n"Disgustingly indecent, I should say." John looked very black, for\r\neven with him the feeling about the Whartons and the Vaughans and the\r\nFletchers was very strong. "He\'s a man I should say you wouldn\'t let\r\ninto Longbarns."\r\n\r\n"There might be various reasons for that. It might be that you\r\nwouldn\'t care to meet him."\r\n\r\n"Well;--no,--I don\'t suppose I should. But without that you wouldn\'t\r\nlike him. I don\'t think he\'s an Englishman."\r\n\r\n"A foreigner!"\r\n\r\n"He has got a foreign name."\r\n\r\n"An Italian nobleman?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he\'s noble in any country."\r\n\r\n"Who the d---- is he?"\r\n\r\n"His name is--Lopez."\r\n\r\n"Everett\'s friend?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--Everett\'s friend. I ain\'t very much obliged to Master Everett\r\nfor what he has done."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen the man. Indeed, I may say I know him,--for I dined with\r\nhim once in Manchester Square. Old Wharton himself must have asked\r\nhim there."\r\n\r\n"He was there as Everett\'s friend. I only heard all this to-day, you\r\nknow;--though I had heard about it before."\r\n\r\n"And therefore you want to set out on your travels. As far as I saw I\r\nshould say he is a clever fellow."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt that."\r\n\r\n"And a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he is not," said Arthur. "I\'ve no right to say a\r\nword against him. From what Wharton says I suppose he\'s rich."\r\n\r\n"He\'s good looking too;--at least he\'s the sort of man that women\r\nlike to look at."\r\n\r\n"Just so. I\'ve no cause of quarrel with him,--nor with her. But--."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my friend, I see it all," said the elder brother. "I think\r\nI know all about it. But running away is not the thing. One may\r\nbe pretty nearly sure that one is right when one says that a man\r\nshouldn\'t run away from anything."\r\n\r\n"The thing is to be happy if you can," said Arthur.\r\n\r\n"No;--that is not the thing. I\'m not much of a philosopher, but as\r\nfar as I can see there are two philosophies in the world. The one\r\nis to make one\'s self happy, and the other is to make other people\r\nhappy. The latter answers the best."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t add to her happiness by hanging about London."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a quibble. It isn\'t her happiness we are talking about,--nor\r\nyet your hanging about London. Gird yourself up and go on with what\r\nyou\'ve got to do. Put your work before your feelings. What does a\r\npoor man do, who goes out hedging and ditching with a dead child\r\nlying in his house? If you get a blow in the face, return it if it\r\nought to be returned, but never complain of the pain. If you must\r\nhave your vitals eaten into,--have them eaten into like a man. But,\r\nmind you,--these ain\'t your vitals."\r\n\r\n"It goes pretty near."\r\n\r\n"These ain\'t your vitals. A man gets cured of it,--almost always. I\r\nbelieve always; though some men get hit so hard they can never bring\r\nthemselves to try it again. But tell me this. Has old Wharton given\r\nhis consent?"\r\n\r\n"No. He has refused," said Arthur with strong emphasis.\r\n\r\n"How is it to be, then?"\r\n\r\n"He has dealt very fairly by me. He has done all he could to get rid\r\nof the man,--both with him and with her. He has told Emily that he\r\nwill have nothing to do with the man. And she will do nothing without\r\nhis sanction."\r\n\r\n"Then it will remain just as it is."\r\n\r\n"No, John; it will not. He has gone on to say that though he has\r\nrefused,--and has refused roughly enough,--he must give way if he\r\nsees that she has really set her heart upon him. And she has."\r\n\r\n"Has she told you so?"\r\n\r\n"No;--but he has told me. I shall have it out with her to-morrow, if\r\nI can. And then I shall be off."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be here for shooting on the 1st?"\r\n\r\n"No. I dare say you\'re right in what you say about sticking to my\r\nwork. It does seem unmanly to run away because of a girl."\r\n\r\n"Because of anything! Stop and face it, whatever it is."\r\n\r\n"Just so;--but I can\'t stop and face her. It would do no good. For\r\nall our sakes I should be better away. I can get shooting with\r\nMusgrave and Carnegie in Perthshire. I dare say I shall go there, and\r\ntake a share with them."\r\n\r\n"That\'s better than going into all the quarters of the globe."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean that I was to surrender and start at once. You take a\r\nfellow up so short. I shall do very well, I\'ve no doubt, and shall\r\nbe hunting here as jolly as ever at Christmas. But a fellow must say\r\nit all to somebody." The elder brother put his hand out and laid it\r\naffectionately upon the younger one\'s arm. "I\'m not going to whimper\r\nabout the world like a whipped dog. The worst of it is so many people\r\nhave known of this."\r\n\r\n"You mean down here."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--everywhere. I have never told them. It has been a kind of\r\nfamily affair and thought to be fit for general discussions."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll wear away."\r\n\r\n"In the meantime it\'s a bore. But that shall be the end of it. Don\'t\r\nyou say another word to me about it, and I won\'t to you. And tell\r\nmother not to, or Sarah." Sarah was John Fletcher\'s wife. "It has\r\ngot to be dropped, and let us drop it as quickly as we can. If she\r\ndoes marry this man I don\'t suppose she\'ll be much at Longbarns or\r\nWharton."\r\n\r\n"Not at Longbarns certainly, I should say," replied John. "Fancy\r\nmother having to curtsey to her as Mrs. Lopez! And I doubt whether\r\nSir Alured would like him. He isn\'t of our sort. He\'s too clever,\r\ntoo cosmopolitan,--a sort of man white-washed of all prejudices, who\r\nwouldn\'t mind whether he ate horseflesh or beef if horseflesh were as\r\ngood as beef, and never had an association in his life. I\'m not sure\r\nthat he\'s not on the safest side. Good night, old fellow. Pluck up,\r\nand send us plenty of grouse if you do go to Scotland."\r\n\r\nJohn Fletcher, as I hope may have been already seen, was by no\r\nmeans a weak man or an indifferent brother. He was warm-hearted,\r\nsharp-witted, and, though perhaps a little self-opinionated,\r\nconsidered throughout the county to be one of the most prudent in\r\nit. Indeed no one ever ventured to doubt his wisdom on all practical\r\nmatters,--save his mother, who seeing him almost every day, had a\r\nstronger bias towards her younger son. "Arthur has been hit hard\r\nabout that girl," he said to his wife that night.\r\n\r\n"Emily Wharton?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--your cousin Emily. Don\'t say anything to him, but be as good\r\nto him as you know how."\r\n\r\n"Good to Arthur! Am I not always good to him?"\r\n\r\n"Be a little more than usually tender with him. It makes one almost\r\ncry to see such a fellow hurt like that. I can understand it, though\r\nI never had anything of it myself."\r\n\r\n"You never had, John," said the wife leaning close upon the husband\'s\r\nbreast as she spoke. "It all came very easily to you;--too easily\r\nperhaps."\r\n\r\n"If any girl had ever refused me, I should have taken her at her\r\nword, I can tell you. There would have been no second \'hop\' to that\r\nball."\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose I was right to catch it the first time?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say how that may be."\r\n\r\n"I was right. Oh, dear me!--Suppose I had doubted, just for once, and\r\nyou had gone off. You would have tried once more;--wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d have gone about like a broken-winged old hen, and have\r\nsoftened me that way."\r\n\r\n"And now poor Arthur has had his wing broken."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t let on to know that it\'s broken, and the wing will be\r\nhealed in due time. But what fools girls are!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed they are, John;--particularly me."\r\n\r\n"Fancy a girl like Emily Wharton," said he, not condescending to\r\nnotice her little joke, "throwing over a fellow like Arthur for a\r\ngreasy, black foreigner."\r\n\r\n"A foreigner!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--a man named Lopez. Don\'t say anything about it at present.\r\nWon\'t she live to find out the difference, and to know what she has\r\ndone! I can tell her of one that won\'t pity her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nGood-Bye\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Fletcher received his brother\'s teaching as true, and took\r\nhis brother\'s advice in good part;--so that, before the morning\r\nfollowing, he had resolved that however deep the wound might be, he\r\nwould so live before the world, that the world should not see his\r\nwound. What people already knew they must know,--but they should\r\nlearn nothing further either by words or signs from him. He would,\r\nas he had said to his brother, "have it out with Emily"; and then,\r\nif she told him plainly that she loved the man, he would bid her\r\nadieu, simply expressing regret that their course for life should be\r\ndivided. He was confident that she would tell him the entire truth.\r\nShe would be restrained neither by false modesty, nor by any assumed\r\nunwillingness to discuss her own affairs with a friend so true to\r\nher as he had been. He knew her well enough to be sure that she\r\nrecognised the value of his love though she could not bring herself\r\nto accept it. There are rejected lovers who, merely because they are\r\nlovers, become subject to the scorn and even to the disgust of the\r\ngirls they love. But again there are men who, even when they are\r\nrejected, are almost loved, who are considered to be worthy of all\r\nreverence, almost of worship;--and yet the worshippers will not love\r\nthem. Not analysing all this, but somewhat conscious of the light in\r\nwhich this girl regarded him, he knew that what he might say would be\r\ntreated with deference. As to shaking her,--as to talking her out of\r\none purpose and into another,--that to him did not for a moment seem\r\nto be practicable. There was no hope of that. He hardly knew why he\r\nshould endeavour to say a word to her before he left Wharton. And yet\r\nhe felt that it must be said. Were he to allow her to be married to\r\nthis man, without any further previous word between them, it would\r\nappear that he had resolved to quarrel with her for ever. But now, at\r\nthis very moment of time, as he lay in his bed, as he dressed himself\r\nin the morning, as he sauntered about among the new hay-stacks with\r\nhis pipe in his mouth after breakfast, he came to some conclusion in\r\nhis mind very much averse to such quarrelling.\r\n\r\nHe had loved her with all his heart. It had not been a mere\r\ndrawing-room love begotten between a couple of waltzes, and fostered\r\nby five minutes in a crush. He knew himself to be a man of the world,\r\nand he did not wish to be other than he was. He could talk among men\r\nas men talked, and act as men acted;--and he could do the same with\r\nwomen. But there was one person who had been to him above all, and\r\nround everything, and under everything. There had been a private nook\r\nwithin him into which there had been no entrance but for the one\r\nimage. There had been a holy of holies, which he had guarded within\r\nhimself, keeping it free from all outer contamination for his own\r\nuse. He had cherished the idea of a clear fountain of ever-running\r\nwater which would at last be his, always ready for the comfort of his\r\nown lips. Now all his hope was shattered, his trust was gone, and his\r\nlonging disappointed. But the person was the same person, though she\r\ncould not be his. The nook was there, though she would not fill it.\r\nThe holy of holies was not less holy, though he himself might not\r\ndare to lift the curtain. The fountain would still run,--still the\r\nclearest fountain of all,--though he might not put his lips to it. He\r\nwould never allow himself to think of it with lessened reverence, or\r\nwith changed ideas as to her nature.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as he stood leaning against a ladder which still kept\r\nits place against one of the hay-ricks, and filled his second pipe\r\nunconsciously, he had to realise to himself the probable condition of\r\nhis future life. Of course she would marry this man with very little\r\nfurther delay. Her father had already declared himself to be too\r\nweak to interfere much longer with her wishes. Of course Mr. Wharton\r\nwould give way. He had himself declared that he would give way. And\r\nthen,--what sort of life would be her life? No one knew anything\r\nabout the man. There was an idea that he was rich,--but wealth such\r\nas his, wealth that is subject to speculation, will fly away at a\r\nmoment\'s notice. He might be cruel, a mere adventurer, or a thorough\r\nruffian for all that was known of him. There should, thought Arthur\r\nFletcher to himself, be more stability in the giving and taking\r\nof wives than could be reckoned upon here. He became old in that\r\nhalf-hour, taking home to himself and appreciating many saws of\r\nwisdom and finger-directions of experience which hitherto had been\r\nto him matters almost of ridicule. But he could only come to this\r\nconclusion,--that as she was still to be to him his holy of holies\r\nthough he might not lay his hand upon the altar, his fountain though\r\nhe might not drink of it, the one image which alone could have filled\r\nthat nook, he would not cease to regard her happiness when she should\r\nhave become the wife of this stranger. With the stranger himself he\r\nnever could be on friendly terms;--but for the stranger\'s wife there\r\nshould always be a friend, if the friend were needed.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before lunch, John Fletcher, who had been hanging about\r\nthe house all the morning in a manner very unusual to him, caught\r\nEmily Wharton as she was passing through the hall, and told her that\r\nArthur was in a certain part of the grounds and wished to speak to\r\nher. "Alone?" she asked. "Yes, certainly alone." "Ought I to go to\r\nhim, John?" she asked again. "Certainly I think you ought." Then he\r\nhad done his commission and was able to apply himself to whatever\r\nbusiness he had on hand.\r\n\r\nEmily at once put on her hat, took her parasol, and left the house.\r\nThere was something distasteful to her in the idea of this going out\r\nat a lover\'s bidding, to meet him; but like all Whartons and all\r\nFletchers, she trusted John Fletcher. And then she was aware that\r\nthere were circumstances which might make such a meeting as this\r\nserviceable. She knew nothing of what had taken place during the last\r\nfour-and-twenty hours. She had no idea that in consequence of words\r\nspoken to him by her father and his brother, Arthur Fletcher was\r\nabout to abandon his suit. There would have been no doubt about her\r\ngoing to meet him had she thought this. She supposed that she would\r\nhave to hear again the old story. If so, she would hear it, and\r\nwould then have an opportunity of telling him that her heart had\r\nbeen given entirely to another. She knew all that she owed to him.\r\nAfter a fashion she did love him. He was entitled to all kindest\r\nconsideration from her hands. But he should be told the truth.\r\n\r\nAs she entered the shrubbery he came out to meet her, giving her his\r\nhand with a frank, easy air and a pleasant smile. His smile was as\r\nbright as the ripple of the sea, and his eye would then gleam, and\r\nthe slightest sparkle of his white teeth would be seen between his\r\nlips, and the dimple of his chin would show itself deeper than at\r\nother times. "It is very good of you. I thought you\'d come. John\r\nasked you, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he told me you were here, and he said I ought to come."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about ought, but I think it better. Will you mind\r\nwalking on, as I\'ve got something that I want to say?" Then he turned\r\nand she turned with him into the little wood. "I\'m not going to\r\nbother you any more, my darling," he said. "You are still my darling,\r\nthough I will not call you so after this." Her heart sank almost in\r\nher bosom as she heard this,--though it was exactly what she would\r\nhave wished to hear. But now there must be some close understanding\r\nbetween them and some tenderness. She knew how much she had owed him,\r\nhow good he had been to her, how true had been his love; and she felt\r\nthat words would fail her to say that which ought to be said. "So you\r\nhave given yourself to--one Ferdinand Lopez!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, in a hard, dry voice. "Yes; I have. I do not know\r\nwho told you; but I have."\r\n\r\n"Your father told me. It was better,--was it not?--that I should\r\nknow. You are not sorry that I should know?"\r\n\r\n"It is better."\r\n\r\n"I am not going to say a word against him."\r\n\r\n"No;--do not do that."\r\n\r\n"Nor against you. I am simply here now to let you know that--I\r\nretire."\r\n\r\n"You will not quarrel with me, Arthur?"\r\n\r\n"Quarrel with you! I could not quarrel with you, if I would.\r\nNo;--there shall be no quarrel. But I do not suppose we shall see\r\neach other very often."\r\n\r\n"I hope we may."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes, perhaps. A man should not, I think, affect to be friends\r\nwith a successful rival. I dare say he is an excellent fellow, but\r\nhow is it possible that he and I should get on together? But you will\r\nalways have one,--one besides him,--who will love you best in this\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"No;--no;--no."\r\n\r\n"It must be so. There will be nothing wrong in that. Every one has\r\nsome dearest friend, and you will always be mine. If anything of evil\r\nshould ever happen to you,--which of course there won\'t,--there would\r\nbe some one who would--. But I don\'t want to talk buncum; I only want\r\nyou to believe me. Good-bye, and God bless you." Then he put out his\r\nright hand, holding his hat under his left arm.\r\n\r\n"You are not going away?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, perhaps. But I will say my real good-bye to you here,\r\nnow, to-day. I hope you may be happy. I hope it with all my heart.\r\nGood-bye. God bless you!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Arthur!" Then she put her hand in his.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have loved you so dearly. It has been with my whole heart. You\r\nhave never quite understood me, but it has been as true as heaven. I\r\nhave thought sometimes that had I been a little less earnest about\r\nit, I should have been a little less stupid. A man shouldn\'t let it\r\nget the better of him, as I have done. Say good-bye to me, Emily."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," she said, still leaving her hand in his.\r\n\r\n"I suppose that\'s about all. Don\'t let them quarrel with you here\r\nif you can help it. Of course at Longbarns they won\'t like it for\r\na time. Oh,--if it could have been different!" Then he dropped her\r\nhand, and turning his back quickly upon her, went away along the\r\npath.\r\n\r\nShe had expected and had almost wished that he should kiss her. A\r\ngirl\'s cheek is never so holy to herself as it is to her lover,--if\r\nhe do love her. There would have been something of reconciliation,\r\nsomething of a promise of future kindness in a kiss, which even\r\nFerdinand would not have grudged. It would, for her, have robbed\r\nthe parting of that bitterness of pain which his words had given to\r\nit. As to all that, he had made no calculation; but the bitterness\r\nwas there for him, and he could have done nothing that would have\r\nexpelled it.\r\n\r\nShe wept bitterly as she returned to the house. There might have been\r\ncause for joy. It was clear enough that her father, though he had\r\nshown no sign to her of yielding, was nevertheless prepared to yield.\r\nIt was her father who had caused Arthur Fletcher to take himself off,\r\nas a lover really dismissed. But, at this moment, she could not bring\r\nherself to look at that aspect of the affair. Her mind would revert\r\nto all those choicest moments in her early years in which she had\r\nbeen happy with Arthur Fletcher; in which she had first learned to\r\nlove him, and had then taught herself to understand by some confused\r\nand perplexed lesson that she did not love him as men and women love.\r\nBut why should she not so have loved him? Would she not have done so\r\ncould she then have understood how true and firm he was? And then,\r\nindependently of herself, throwing herself aside for the time as\r\nshe was bound to do when thinking of one so good to her as Arthur\r\nFletcher, she found that no personal joy could drown the grief which\r\nshe shared with him. For a moment the idea of a comparison between\r\nthe two men forced itself upon her,--but she drove it from her as she\r\nhurried back to the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Omnium Thinks of Himself\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blaze made by the Duchess of Omnium during the three months of\r\nthe season up in London had been very great, but it was little in\r\ncomparison with the social coruscation expected to be achieved at\r\nGatherum Castle,--little at least as far as public report went, and\r\nthe general opinion of the day. No doubt the house in Carlton Gardens\r\nhad been thrown open as the house of no Prime Minister, perhaps of no\r\nduke, had been opened before in this country; but it had been done by\r\ndegrees, and had not been accompanied by such a blowing of trumpets\r\nas was sounded with reference to the entertainments at Gatherum.\r\nI would not have it supposed that the trumpets were blown by the\r\ndirect order of the Duchess. The trumpets were blown by the customary\r\ntrumpeters as it became known that great things were to be done,--all\r\nnewspapers and very many tongues lending their assistance, till the\r\nsounds of the instruments almost frightened the Duchess herself.\r\n"Isn\'t it odd," she said to her friend, Mrs. Finn, "that one can\'t\r\nhave a few friends down in the country without such a fuss about it\r\nas the people are making?" Mrs. Finn did not think that it was odd,\r\nand so she said. Thousands of pounds were being spent in a very\r\nconspicuous way. Invitations to the place even for a couple of\r\ndays,--for twenty-four hours,--had been begged for abjectly. It\r\nwas understood everywhere that the Prime Minister was bidding for\r\ngreatness and popularity. Of course the trumpets were blown very\r\nloudly. "If people don\'t take care," said the Duchess, "I\'ll put\r\neverybody off and have the whole place shut up. I\'d do it for\r\nsixpence, now."\r\n\r\nPerhaps of all the persons, much or little concerned, the one who\r\nheard the least of the trumpets,--or rather who was the last to hear\r\nthem,--was the Duke himself. He could not fail to see something in\r\nthe newspapers, but what he did see did not attract him so frequently\r\nor so strongly as it did others. It was a pity, he thought, that\r\na man\'s social and private life should be made subject to so many\r\nremarks, but this misfortune was one of those to which wealth and\r\nrank are liable. He had long recognised that fact, and for a time\r\nendeavoured to believe that his intended sojourn at Gatherum Castle\r\nwas not more public than are the autumn doings of other dukes and\r\nother prime ministers. But gradually the trumpets did reach even his\r\nears. Blind as he was to many things himself, he always had near to\r\nhim that other duke who was never blind to anything. "You are going\r\nto do great things at Gatherum this year," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Nothing particular, I hope," said the Prime Minister, with an inward\r\ntrepidation,--for gradually there had crept upon him a fear that his\r\nwife was making a mistake.\r\n\r\n"I thought it was going to be very particular."\r\n\r\n"It\'s Glencora\'s doing."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt but that her Grace is right. Don\'t suppose that I am\r\ncriticizing your hospitality. We are to be at Gatherum ourselves\r\nabout the end of the month. It will be the first time I shall have\r\nseen the place since your uncle\'s time."\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister at this moment was sitting in his own particular\r\nroom at the Treasury Chambers, and before the entrance of his friend\r\nhad been conscientiously endeavouring to define for himself, not a\r\nfuture policy, but the past policy of the last month or two. It had\r\nnot been for him a very happy occupation. He had become the Head of\r\nthe Government,--and had not failed, for there he was, still the\r\nHead of the Government, with a majority at his back, and the six\r\nmonths\' vacation before him. They who were entitled to speak to him\r\nconfidentially as to his position, were almost vehement in declaring\r\nhis success. Mr. Rattler, about a week ago, had not seen any reason\r\nwhy the Ministry should not endure at least for the next four years.\r\nMr. Roby, from the other side, was equally confident. But, on looking\r\nback at what he had done, and indeed on looking forward into his\r\nfuture intentions, he could not see why he, of all men, should be\r\nPrime Minister. He had once been Chancellor of the Exchequer, filling\r\nthat office through two halcyon Sessions, and he had known the reason\r\nwhy he had held it. He had ventured to assure himself at the time\r\nthat he was the best man whom his party could then have found for\r\nthat office, and he had been satisfied. But he had none of that\r\nsatisfaction now. There were men under him who were really at\r\nwork. The Lord Chancellor had legal reforms on foot. Mr. Monk\r\nwas busy, heart and soul, in regard to income tax and brewers\'\r\nlicences,--making our poor Prime Minister\'s mouth water. Lord\r\nDrummond was active among the colonies. Phineas Finn had at any rate\r\nhis ideas about Ireland. But with the Prime Minister,--so at least\r\nthe Duke told himself,--it was all a blank. The policy confided\r\nto him and expected at his hands was that of keeping together a\r\nCoalition Ministry. That was a task that did not satisfy him. And\r\nnow, gradually,--very slowly indeed at first, but still with a\r\nsure step,--there was creeping upon him the idea that his power of\r\ncohesion was sought for, and perhaps found, not in his political\r\ncapacity, but in his rank and wealth. It might, in fact, be the\r\ncase that it was his wife the Duchess,--that Lady Glencora of whose\r\nwild impulses and general impracticability he had always been in\r\ndread,--that she with her dinner parties and receptions, with her\r\ncrowded saloons, her music, her picnics, and social temptations, was\r\nPrime Minister rather than he himself. It might be that this had been\r\nunderstood by the coalesced parties,--by everybody, in fact, except\r\nhimself. It had, perhaps, been found that in the state of things\r\nthen existing, a ministry could be best kept together, not by\r\nparliamentary capacity, but by social arrangements, such as his\r\nDuchess, and his Duchess alone, could carry out. She and she only\r\nwould have the spirit and the money and the sort of cleverness\r\nrequired. In such a state of things he of course, as her husband,\r\nmust be the nominal Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThere was no anger in his bosom as he thought of this. It would\r\nbe hardly just to say that there was jealousy. His nature was\r\nessentially free from jealousy. But there was shame,--and\r\nself-accusation at having accepted so great an office with so little\r\nfixed purpose as to great work. It might be his duty to subordinate\r\neven his pride to the service of his country, and to consent to be\r\na faineant minister, a gilded Treasury log, because by remaining in\r\nthat position he would enable the Government to be carried on. But\r\nhow base the position, how mean, how repugnant to that grand idea of\r\npublic work which had hitherto been the motive power of all his life!\r\nHow would he continue to live if this thing were to go on from year\r\nto year,--he pretending to govern while others governed,--stalking\r\nabout from one public hall to another in a blue ribbon, taking the\r\nhighest place at all tables, receiving mock reverence, and known to\r\nall men as faineant First Lord of the Treasury? Now, as he had been\r\nthinking of all this, the most trusted of his friends had come to\r\nhim, and had at once alluded to the very circumstances which had been\r\npressing so heavily on his mind. "I was delighted," continued the\r\nelder Duke, "when I heard that you had determined to go to Gatherum\r\nCastle this year."\r\n\r\n"If a man has a big house I suppose he ought to live in it,\r\nsometimes."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. It was for such purposes as this now intended that your\r\nuncle built it. He never became a public man, and therefore, though\r\nhe went there, every year I believe, he never really used it."\r\n\r\n"He hated it,--in his heart. And so do I. And so does Glencora. I\r\ndon\'t see why any man should have his private life interrupted by\r\nbeing made to keep a huge caravansary open for persons he doesn\'t\r\ncare a straw about."\r\n\r\n"You would not like to live alone."\r\n\r\n"Alone,--with my wife and children,--I would certainly, during a\r\nportion of the year at least."\r\n\r\n"I doubt whether such a life, even for a month, even for a week, is\r\ncompatible with your duties. You would hardly find it possible. Could\r\nyou do without your private secretaries? Would you know enough of\r\nwhat is going on, if you did not discuss matters with others? A man\r\ncannot be both private and public at the same time."\r\n\r\n"And therefore one has to be chopped up, like \'a reed out of the\r\nriver,\' as the poet said, \'and yet not give sweet music afterwards.\'"\r\nThe Duke of St. Bungay said nothing in answer to this, as he did not\r\nunderstand the chopping of the reed. "I\'m afraid I\'ve been wrong\r\nabout this collection of people down at Gatherum," continued the\r\nyounger Duke. "Glencora is impulsive, and has overdone the thing.\r\nJust look at that." And he handed a letter to his friend. The old\r\nDuke put on his spectacles and read the letter through,--which ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Private.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD DUKE,--\r\n\r\n   I do not doubt but that your Grace is aware of my position\r\n   in regard to the public press of the country, and I beg to\r\n   assure your Grace that my present proposition is made, not\r\n   on account of the great honour and pleasure which would be\r\n   conferred upon myself should your Grace accede to it, but\r\n   because I feel assured that I might so be best enabled to\r\n   discharge an important duty for the benefit of the public\r\n   generally.\r\n\r\n   Your Grace is about to receive the whole fashionable world\r\n   of England and many distinguished foreign ambassadors at\r\n   your ancestral halls, not solely for social delight,--for\r\n   a man in your Grace\'s high position is not able to think\r\n   only of a pleasant life,--but in order that the prestige\r\n   of your combined Ministry may be so best maintained. That\r\n   your Grace is thereby doing a duty to your country no man\r\n   who understands the country can doubt. But it must be the\r\n   case that the country at large should interest itself in\r\n   your festivities, and should demand to have accounts of\r\n   the gala doings of your ducal palace. Your Grace will\r\n   probably agree with me that these records could be better\r\n   given by one empowered by yourself to give them, by one\r\n   who had been present, and who would write in your Grace\'s\r\n   interest, than by some interloper who would receive his\r\n   tale only at second hand.\r\n\r\n   It is my purport now to inform your Grace that should\r\n   I be honoured by an invitation to your Grace\'s party at\r\n   Gatherum, I should obey such a call with the greatest\r\n   alacrity, and would devote my pen and the public organ\r\n   which is at my disposal to your Grace\'s service with the\r\n   readiest good-will.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   My Lord Duke,\r\n   Your Grace\'s most obedient\r\n   And very humble servant,\r\n\r\n   QUINTUS SLIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old Duke, when he had read the letter, laughed heartily. "Isn\'t\r\nthat a terribly bad sign of the times?" said the younger.\r\n\r\n"Well;--hardly that, I think. The man is both a fool and a\r\nblackguard; but I don\'t think we are therefore to suppose that there\r\nare many fools and blackguards like him. I wonder what he really has\r\nwanted."\r\n\r\n"He has wanted me to ask him to Gatherum."\r\n\r\n"He can hardly have expected that. I don\'t think he can have been\r\nsuch a fool. He may have thought that there was a possible off\r\nchance, and that he would not lose even that for want of asking. Of\r\ncourse you won\'t notice it."\r\n\r\n"I have asked Warburton to write to him, saying that he cannot be\r\nreceived at my house. I have all letters answered unless they seem to\r\nhave come from insane persons. Would it not shock you if your private\r\narrangements were invaded in that way?"\r\n\r\n"He can\'t invade you."\r\n\r\n"Yes he can. He does. That is an invasion. And whether he is there\r\nor not, he can and will write about my house. And though no one\r\nelse will make himself such a fool as he has done by his letter,\r\nnevertheless even that is a sign of what others are doing.\r\nYou yourself were saying just now that we were going to do\r\nsomething,--something particular, you said."\r\n\r\n"It was your word, and I echoed it. I suppose you are going to have a\r\ngreat many people?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid Glencora has overdone it. I don\'t know why I should\r\ntrouble you by saying so, but it makes me uneasy."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see why."\r\n\r\n"I fear she has got some idea into her head of astounding the world\r\nby display."\r\n\r\n"I think she has got an idea of conquering the world by graciousness\r\nand hospitality."\r\n\r\n"It is as bad. It is, indeed, the same thing. Why should she want to\r\nconquer what we call the world? She ought to want to entertain my\r\nfriends because they are my friends; and if from my public position\r\nI have more so-called friends than would trouble me in a happier\r\ncondition of private life, why, then, she must entertain more people.\r\nThere should be nothing beyond that. The idea of conquering people,\r\nas you call it, by feeding them, is to me abominable. If it goes on\r\nit will drive me mad. I shall have to give up everything, because\r\nI cannot bear the burden." This he said with more excitement, with\r\nstronger passion, than his friend had ever seen in him before; so\r\nmuch so that the old Duke was frightened. "I ought never to have been\r\nwhere I am," said the Prime Minister, getting up from his chair and\r\nwalking about the room.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to assure you that in that you are decidedly mistaken,"\r\nsaid his Grace of St. Bungay.\r\n\r\n"I cannot make even you see the inside of my heart in such a matter\r\nas this," said his Grace of Omnium.\r\n\r\n"I think I do. It may be that in saying so I claim for myself greater\r\npower than I possess, but I think I do. But let your heart say what\r\nit may on the subject, I am sure of this,--that when the Sovereign,\r\nby the advice of two outgoing Ministers, and with the unequivocally\r\nexpressed assent of the House of Commons, calls on a man to serve her\r\nand the country, that man cannot be justified in refusing, merely by\r\ndoubts about his own fitness. If your health is failing you, you may\r\nknow it, and say so. Or it may be that your honour,--your faith to\r\nothers,--should forbid you to accept the position. But of your own\r\ngeneral fitness you must take the verdict given by such general\r\nconsent. They have seen clearer than you have done what is required,\r\nand know better than you can know how that which is wanted is to be\r\nsecured."\r\n\r\n"If I am to be here and do nothing, must I remain?"\r\n\r\n"A man cannot keep together the Government of a country and do\r\nnothing. Do not trouble yourself about this crowd at Gatherum. The\r\nDuchess, easily, almost without exertion, will do that which to you,\r\nor to me either, would be impossible. Let her have her way, and take\r\nno notice of the Quintus Slides." The Prime Minister smiled, as\r\nthough this repeated allusion to Mr. Slide\'s letter had brought\r\nback his good humour, and said nothing further then as to his\r\ndifficulties. There were a few words to be spoken as to some\r\nfuture Cabinet meeting, something perhaps to be settled as to some\r\nman\'s work or position, a hint to be given, and a lesson to be\r\nlearned,--for of these inner Cabinet Councils between these two\r\nstatesmen there was frequent use; and then the Duke of St. Bungay\r\ntook his leave.\r\n\r\nOur Duke, as soon as his friend had left him, rang for his private\r\nsecretary, and went to work diligently, as though nothing had\r\ndisturbed him. I do not know that his labours on that occasion\r\nwere of a very high order. Unless there be some special effort of\r\nlawmaking before the country, some reform bill to be passed, some\r\nattempt at education to be made, some fetters to be forged or to\r\nbe relaxed, a Prime Minister is not driven hard by the work of his\r\nportfolio,--as are his colleagues. But many men were in want of many\r\nthings, and contrived by many means to make their wants known to the\r\nPrime Minister. A dean would fain be a bishop, or a judge a chief\r\njustice, or a commissioner a chairman, or a secretary a commissioner.\r\nKnights would fain be baronets, baronets barons, and barons earls.\r\nIn one guise or another the wants of gentlemen were made known, and\r\nthere was work to be done. A ribbon cannot be given away without\r\nbreaking the hearts of, perhaps, three gentlemen and of their wives\r\nand daughters. And then he went down to the House of Lords,--for the\r\nlast time this Session as far as work was concerned. On the morrow\r\nlegislative work would be over, and the gentlemen of Parliament would\r\nbe sent to their country houses, and to their pleasant country joys.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that on the day after the prorogation of\r\nParliament the Duchess of Omnium should go down to Gatherum to\r\nprepare for the coming of the people, which was to commence about\r\nthree days later, taking her ministers, Mrs. Finn and Locock, with\r\nher; and that her husband with his private secretaries and dispatch\r\nboxes was to go for those three days to Matching, a smaller place\r\nthan Gatherum, but one to which they were much better accustomed. If,\r\nas the Duchess thought to be not unlikely, the Duke should prolong\r\nhis stay for a few days at Matching, she felt confident that she\r\nwould be able to bear the burden of the Castle on her own shoulders.\r\nShe had thought it to be very probable that he would prolong his stay\r\nat Matching, and if the absence were not too long, this might be\r\nwell explained to the assembled company. In the Duchess\'s estimation\r\na Prime Minister would lose nothing by pleading the nature of his\r\nbusiness as an excuse for such absence,--or by having such a plea\r\nmade for him. Of course he must appear at last. But as to that she\r\nhad no fear. His timidity, and his conscience also, would both be\r\ntoo potent to allow him to shirk the nuisance of Gatherum altogether.\r\nHe would come, she was sure; but she did not much care how long he\r\ndeferred his coming. She was, therefore, not a little surprised when\r\nhe announced to her an alteration in his plans. This he did not many\r\nhours after the Duke of St. Bungay had left him at the Treasury\r\nChambers. "I think I shall go down with you at once to Gatherum," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"What is the meaning of that?" The Duchess was not skilled in hiding\r\nher feelings, at any rate from him, and declared to him at once by\r\nher voice and eye that the proposed change was not gratifying to her.\r\n\r\n"It will be better. I had thought that I would get a quiet day or two\r\nat Matching. But as the thing has to be done, it may as well be done\r\nat first. A man ought to receive his own guests. I can\'t say that I\r\nlook forward to any great pleasure in doing so on this occasion;--but\r\nI shall do it." It was very easy to understand also the tone of his\r\nvoice. There was in it something of offended dignity, something\r\nof future marital intentions,--something also of the weakness of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nShe did not want him to come at once to Gatherum. A great deal of\r\nmoney was being spent, and the absolute spending was not yet quite\r\nperfected. There might still be possibility of interference. The\r\ntents were not all pitched. The lamps were not as yet all hung in the\r\nconservatories. Waggons would still be coming in and workmen still be\r\ngoing out. He would think less of what had been done if he could be\r\nkept from seeing it while it was being done. And the greater crowd\r\nwhich would be gathered there by the end of the first week would\r\ncarry off the vastness of the preparations. As to money, he had given\r\nher almost carte blanche, having at one vacillatory period of his\r\nPrime Ministership been talked by her into some agreement with her\r\nown plans. And in regard to money he would say to himself that he\r\nought not to interfere with any whim of hers on that score, unless\r\nhe thought it right to crush the whim on some other score. Half what\r\nhe possessed had been hers, and even if during this year he were to\r\nspend more than his income,--if he were to double or even treble the\r\nexpenditure of past years,--he could not consume the additions to his\r\nwealth which had accrued and heaped themselves up since his marriage.\r\nHe had therefore written a line to his banker, and a line to his\r\nlawyer, and he had himself seen Locock, and his wife\'s hands had been\r\nloosened. "I didn\'t think, your Grace," said Locock, "that his Grace\r\nwould be so very--very--very--" "Very what, Locock?" "So very free,\r\nyour Grace." The Duchess, as she thought of it, declared to herself\r\nthat her husband was the truest nobleman in all England. She revered,\r\nadmired, and almost loved him. She knew him to be infinitely better\r\nthan herself. But she could hardly sympathise with him, and was quite\r\nsure that he did not sympathise with her. He was so good about the\r\nmoney! But yet it was necessary that he should be kept in the dark\r\nas to the spending of a good deal of it. Now he was going to upset a\r\nportion of her plans by coming to Gatherum before he was wanted. She\r\nknew him to be obstinate, but it might be possible to turn him back\r\nto his old purpose by clever manipulation.\r\n\r\n"Of course it would be much nicer for me," she said.\r\n\r\n"That alone would be sufficient."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, dear. But we had arranged for people to come at first whom\r\nI thought you would not specially care to meet. Sir Orlando and Mr.\r\nRattler will be there with their wives."\r\n\r\n"I have become quite used to Sir Orlando and Mr. Rattler."\r\n\r\n"No doubt, and therefore I wanted to spare you something of their\r\ncompany. The Duke, whom you really do like, isn\'t coming yet. I\r\nthought, too, you would have your work to finish off."\r\n\r\n"I fear it is of a kind that won\'t bear finishing off. However, I\r\nhave made up my mind, and have already told Locock to send word to\r\nthe people at Matching to say that I shall not be there yet. How long\r\nwill all this last at Gatherum?"\r\n\r\n"Who can say?"\r\n\r\n"I should have thought you could. People are not coming, I suppose,\r\nfor an indefinite time."\r\n\r\n"As one set leaves, one asks others."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you asked enough as yet? I should like to know when we may\r\nexpect to get away from the place."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t stay till the end, you know."\r\n\r\n"But you must."\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"And I should wish you to go with me, when we do go to Matching."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Plantagenet," said the wife, "what a Darby and Joan kind of\r\nthing you like to have it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. The Darby and Joan kind of thing is what I like."\r\n\r\n"Only Darby is to be in an office all day, and in Parliament all\r\nnight,--and Joan is to stay at home."\r\n\r\n"Would you wish me not to be in an office, and not to be in\r\nParliament? But don\'t let us misunderstand each other. You are doing\r\nthe best you can to further what you think to be my interests."\r\n\r\n"I am," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"I love you the better for it, day by day." This so surprised her,\r\nthat as she took him by the arm, her eyes were filled with tears. "I\r\nknow that you are working for me quite as hard as I work myself, and\r\nthat you are doing so with the pure ambition of seeing your husband a\r\ngreat man."\r\n\r\n"And myself a great man\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"It is the same thing. But I would not have you overdo your work.\r\nI would not have you make yourself conspicuous by anything like\r\ndisplay. There are ill-natured people who will say things that you do\r\nnot expect, and to which I should be more sensitive than I ought to\r\nbe. Spare me such pain as this, if you can." He still held her hand\r\nas he spoke, and she answered him only by nodding her head. "I will\r\ngo down with you to Gatherum on Friday." Then he left her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nVulgarity\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Duchess with their children and personal servants\r\nreached Gatherum Castle the day before the first crowd of visitors\r\nwas expected. It was on a lovely autumn afternoon, and the Duke,\r\nwho had endeavoured to make himself pleasant during the journey,\r\nhad suggested that as soon as the heat would allow them they would\r\nsaunter about the grounds and see what was being done. They could\r\ndine late, at half-past eight or nine, so that they might be walking\r\nfrom seven to eight. But the Duchess when she reached the Castle\r\ndeclined to fall into this arrangement. The journey had been hot\r\nand dusty and she was a little cross. They reached the place about\r\nfive, and then she declared that she would have a cup of tea and lie\r\ndown; she was too tired to walk; and the sun, she said, was still\r\nscorchingly hot. He then asked that the children might go with him;\r\nbut the two little girls were weary and travel-worn, and the two\r\nboys, the elder of whom was home from Eton and the younger from\r\nsome minor Eton, were already out about the place after their own\r\npleasures. So the Duke started for his walk alone.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess certainly did not wish to have to inspect the works in\r\nconjunction with her husband. She knew how much there was that she\r\nought still to do herself, how many things that she herself ought\r\nto see. But she could neither do anything nor see anything to any\r\npurpose under his wing. As to lying down, that she knew to be quite\r\nout of the question. She had already found out that the life which\r\nshe had adopted was one of incessant work. But she was neither weak\r\nnor idle. She was quite prepared to work,--if only she might work\r\nafter her own fashion and with companions chosen by herself. Had not\r\nher husband been so perverse, she would have travelled down with Mrs.\r\nFinn, whose coming was now postponed for two days, and Locock would\r\nhave been with her. The Duke had given directions which made it\r\nnecessary that Locock\'s coming should be postponed for a day, and\r\nthis was another grievance. She was put out a good deal, and began to\r\nspeculate whether her husband was doing it on purpose to torment her.\r\nNevertheless, as soon as she knew that he was out of the way, she\r\nwent to her work. She could not go out among the tents and lawns and\r\nconservatories, as she would probably meet him. But she gave orders\r\nas to bedchambers, saw to the adornments of the reception-rooms, had\r\nan eye to the banners and martial trophies suspended in the vast\r\nhall, and the busts and statues which adorned the corners, looked\r\nin on the plate which was being prepared for the great dining-room,\r\nand superintended the moving about of chairs, sofas, and tables\r\ngenerally. "You may take it as certain, Mrs. Pritchard," she said to\r\nthe housekeeper, "that there will never be less than forty for the\r\nnext two months."\r\n\r\n"Forty to sleep, my lady?" To Pritchard the Duchess had for many\r\nyears been Lady Glencora, and she perhaps understood that her\r\nmistress liked the old appellation.\r\n\r\n"Yes, forty to sleep, and forty to eat, and forty to drink. But\r\nthat\'s nothing. Forty to push through twenty-four hours every day! Do\r\nyou think you\'ve got everything that you want?"\r\n\r\n"It depends, my lady, how long each of \'em stays."\r\n\r\n"One night! No,--say two nights on an average."\r\n\r\n"That makes shifting the beds very often;--doesn\'t it, my lady?"\r\n\r\n"Send up to Puddick\'s for sheets to-morrow. Why wasn\'t that thought\r\nof before?"\r\n\r\n"It was, my lady,--and I think we shall do. We\'ve got the\r\nsteam-washery put up."\r\n\r\n"Towels!" suggested the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, my lady. Puddick\'s did send a great many things;--a whole\r\nwaggon load there was come from the station. But the tablecloths\r\nain\'t, none of \'em, long enough for the big table." The Duchess\'s\r\nface fell. "Of course there must be two. On them very long tables, my\r\nlady, there always is two."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell me, so that I could have had them made? It\'s\r\nimpossible,--impossible that one brain should think of it all. Are\r\nyou sure you\'ve got enough hands in the kitchen?"\r\n\r\n"Well, my lady;--we couldn\'t do with more; and they ain\'t an atom of\r\nuse,--only just in the way,--if you don\'t know something about \'em.\r\nI suppose Mr. Millepois will be down soon." This name, which Mrs.\r\nPritchard called Milleypoise, indicated a French cook who was as yet\r\nunknown at the Castle.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be here to-night."\r\n\r\n"I wish he could have been here a day or two sooner, my lady, so as\r\njust to see about him."\r\n\r\n"And how should we have got our dinner in town? He won\'t make any\r\ndifficulties. The confectioner did come?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lady; and to tell the truth out at once, he was that drunk\r\nlast night that--; oh, dear, we didn\'t know what to do with him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind that before the affair begins. I don\'t suppose he\'ll\r\nget tipsy while he has to work for all these people. You\'ve plenty of\r\neggs?"\r\n\r\nThese questions went on so rapidly that in addition to the asking\r\nof them the Duchess was able to go through all the rooms before she\r\ndressed for dinner, and in every room she saw something to speak of,\r\nnoting either perfection or imperfection. In the meantime the Duke\r\nhad gone out alone. It was still hot, but he had made up his mind\r\nthat he would enjoy his first holiday out of town by walking about\r\nhis own grounds, and he would not allow the heat to interrupt him.\r\nHe went out through the vast hall, and the huge front door, which\r\nwas so huge and so grand that it was very seldom used. But it was\r\nnow open by chance, owing to some incident of this festival time,\r\nand he passed through it and stood upon the grand terrace, with the\r\nwell-known and much-lauded portico over head. Up to the terrace,\r\nthough it was very high, there ran a road, constructed upon arches,\r\nso that grand guests could drive almost into the house. The Duke,\r\nwho was never grand himself, as he stood there looking at the\r\nfar-stretching view before him, could not remember that he had ever\r\nbut once before placed himself on that spot. Of what use had been\r\nthe portico, and the marbles, and the huge pile of stone,--of what\r\nuse the enormous hall just behind him, cutting the house in two,\r\ndeclaring aloud by its own aspect and proportions that it had been\r\nbuilt altogether for show and in no degree for use or comfort? And\r\nnow as he stood there he could already see that men were at work\r\nabout the place, that ground had been moved here, and grass laid down\r\nthere, and a new gravel road constructed in another place. Was it not\r\npossible that his friends should be entertained without all these\r\nchanges in the gardens? Then he perceived the tents, and descending\r\nfrom the terrace and turning to the left towards the end of the house\r\nhe came upon a new conservatory. The exotics with which it was to\r\nbe filled were at this moment being brought in on great barrows. He\r\nstood for a moment and looked, but said not a word to the men. They\r\ngazed at him but evidently did not know him. How should they know\r\nhim,--him, who was so seldom there, and who when there never showed\r\nhimself about the place? Then he went farther afield from the house\r\nand came across more and more men. A great ha-ha fence had been made,\r\nenclosing on three sides a large flat and turfed parallelogram of\r\nground, taken out of the park and open at one end to the gardens,\r\ncontaining, as he thought, about an acre. "What are you doing this\r\nfor?" he said to one of the labourers. The man stared at him, and\r\nat first seemed hardly inclined to make him an answer. "It be for\r\nthe quality to shoot their bows and harrows," he said at last, as\r\nhe continued the easy task of patting with his spade the completed\r\nwork. He evidently regarded this stranger as an intruder who was not\r\nentitled to ask questions, even if he were permitted to wander about\r\nthe grounds.\r\n\r\nFrom one place he went on to another and found changes, and new\r\nerections, and some device for throwing away money everywhere. It\r\nangered him to think that there was so little of simplicity left in\r\nthe world that a man could not entertain his friends without such a\r\nfuss as this. His mind applied itself frequently to the consideration\r\nof the money, not that he grudged the loss of it, but the spending of\r\nit in such a cause. And then perhaps there occurred to him an idea\r\nthat all this should not have been done without a word of consent\r\nfrom himself. Had she come to him with some scheme for changing\r\neverything about the place, making him think that the alterations\r\nwere a matter of taste or of mere personal pleasure, he would\r\nprobably have given his assent at once, thinking nothing of the\r\nmoney. But all this was sheer display. Then he walked up and saw the\r\nflag waving over the Castle, indicating that he, the Lord Lieutenant\r\nof the County, was present there on his own soil. That was right.\r\nThat was as it should be, because the flag was waving in compliance\r\nwith an acknowledged ordinance. Of all that properly belonged to\r\nhis rank and station he could be very proud, and would allow no\r\ndiminution of that outward respect to which they were entitled. Were\r\nthey to be trenched on by his fault in his person, the rights of\r\nothers to their enjoyment would be endangered, and the benefits\r\naccruing to his country from established marks of reverence would\r\nbe imperilled. But here was an assumed and preposterous grandeur\r\nthat was as much within the reach of some rich swindler or of some\r\nprosperous haberdasher as of himself,--having, too, a look of raw\r\nnewness about it which was very distasteful to him. And then, too,\r\nhe knew that nothing of all this would have been done unless he had\r\nbecome Prime Minister. Why on earth should a man\'s grounds be knocked\r\nabout because he becomes Prime Minister? He walked on arguing this\r\nwithin his own bosom, till he had worked himself almost up to anger.\r\nIt was clear that he must henceforth take things more into his\r\nown hands, or he would be made to be absurd before the world.\r\nIndifference he knew he could bear. Harsh criticism he thought he\r\ncould endure. But to ridicule he was aware that he was pervious.\r\nSuppose the papers were to say of him that he built a new\r\nconservatory and made an archery ground for the sake of maintaining\r\nthe Coalition!\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to the house he found his wife alone in the small\r\nroom in which they intended to dine. After all her labours she was\r\nnow reclining for the few minutes her husband\'s absence might allow\r\nher, knowing that after dinner there were a score of letters for\r\nher to write. "I don\'t think," said she, "I was ever so tired in my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t such a very long journey after all."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s a very big house, and I\'ve been, I think, into every room\r\nsince I have been here, and I\'ve moved most of the furniture in\r\nthe drawing-rooms with my own hand, and I\'ve counted the pounds of\r\nbutter, and inspected the sheets and tablecloths."\r\n\r\n"Was that necessary, Glencora?"\r\n\r\n"If I had gone to bed instead, the world, I suppose, would have\r\ngone on, and Sir Orlando Drought would still have led the House of\r\nCommons;--but things should be looked after, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"There are people to do it. You are like Martha, troubling yourself\r\nwith many things."\r\n\r\n"I always felt that Martha was very ill-used. If there were no\r\nMarthas there would never be anything fit to eat. But it\'s odd how\r\nsure a wife is to be scolded. If I did nothing at all, that wouldn\'t\r\nplease a busy, hard-working man like you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I have scolded,--not as yet."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to begin?"\r\n\r\n"Not to scold, my dear. Looking back, can you remember that I ever\r\nscolded you?"\r\n\r\n"I can remember a great many times when you ought."\r\n\r\n"But to tell you the truth, I don\'t like all that you have done here.\r\nI cannot see that it was necessary."\r\n\r\n"People make changes in their gardens without necessity sometimes."\r\n\r\n"But these changes are made because of your guests. Had they been\r\nmade to gratify your own taste I would have said nothing,--although\r\neven in that case I think you might have told me what you proposed to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"What;--when you are so burdened with work that you do not know how\r\nto turn?"\r\n\r\n"I am never so burdened that I cannot turn to you. But, as you\r\nknow, that is not what I complain of. If it were done for yourself,\r\nthough it were the wildest vagary, I would learn to like it. But it\r\ndistresses me to think that what might have been good enough for our\r\nfriends before should be thought to be insufficient because of the\r\noffice I hold. There is a--a--a--I was almost going to say vulgarity\r\nabout it which distresses me."\r\n\r\n"Vulgarity!" she exclaimed, jumping up from her sofa.\r\n\r\n"I retract the word. I would not for the world say anything that\r\nshould annoy you;--but pray, pray do not go on with it." Then again\r\nhe left her.\r\n\r\nVulgarity! There was no other word in the language so hard to bear as\r\nthat. He had, indeed, been careful to say that he did not accuse her\r\nof vulgarity,--but nevertheless the accusation had been made. Could\r\nyou call your friend a liar more plainly than by saying to him that\r\nyou would not say that he lied? They dined together, the two boys,\r\nalso, dining with them, but very little was said at dinner. The\r\nhorrid word was clinging to the lady\'s ears, and the remembrance of\r\nhaving uttered the word was heavy on the man\'s conscience. He had\r\ntold himself very plainly that the thing was vulgar, but he had not\r\nmeant to use the word. When uttered it came even upon himself as a\r\nsurprise. But it had been uttered; and, let what apology there may\r\nbe made, a word uttered cannot be retracted. As he looked across\r\nthe table at his wife, he saw that the word had been taken in deep\r\ndudgeon.\r\n\r\nShe escaped, to the writing of her letters she said, almost before\r\nthe meal was done. "Vulgarity!" She uttered the word aloud to\r\nherself, as she sat herself down in the little room up-stairs which\r\nshe had assigned to herself for her own use. But though she was very\r\nangry with him, she did not, even in her own mind, contradict him.\r\nPerhaps it was vulgar. But why shouldn\'t she be vulgar, if she could\r\nmost surely get what she wanted by vulgarity? What was the meaning\r\nof the word vulgarity? Of course she was prepared to do things,--was\r\ndaily doing things,--which would have been odious to her had not her\r\nhusband been a public man. She submitted, without unwillingness,\r\nto constant contact with disagreeable people. She lavished her\r\nsmiles,--so she now said to herself,--on butchers and tinkers. What\r\nshe said, what she read, what she wrote, what she did, whither she\r\nwent, to whom she was kind and to whom unkind,--was it not all said\r\nand done and arranged with reference to his and her own popularity?\r\nWhen a man wants to be Prime Minister he has to submit to vulgarity,\r\nand must give up his ambition if the task be too disagreeable to him.\r\nThe Duchess thought that that had been understood, at any rate ever\r\nsince the days of Coriolanus. "The old Duke kept out of it," she said\r\nto herself, "and chose to live in the other way. He had his choice.\r\nHe wants it to be done. And when I do it for him because he can\'t do\r\nit for himself, he calls it by an ugly name!" Then it occurred to\r\nher that the world tells lies every day,--telling on the whole much\r\nmore lies than truth,--but that the world has wisely agreed that the\r\nworld shall not be accused of lying. One doesn\'t venture to express\r\nopen disbelief even of one\'s wife; and with the world at large\r\na word spoken, whether lie or not, is presumed to be true of\r\ncourse,--because spoken. Jones has said it, and therefore Smith,--who\r\nhas known the lie to be a lie,--has asserted his assured belief,\r\nlying again. But in this way the world is able to live pleasantly.\r\nHow was she to live pleasantly if her husband accused her of\r\nvulgarity? Of course it was all vulgar, but why should he tell her\r\nso? She did not do it from any pleasure that she got from it.\r\n\r\nThe letters remained long unwritten, and then there came a moment in\r\nwhich she resolved that they should not be written. The work was very\r\nhard, and what good would come from it? Why should she make her hands\r\ndirty, so that even her husband accused her of vulgarity? Would it\r\nnot be better to give it all up, and be a great woman, une grande\r\ndame, of another kind,--difficult of access, sparing of her favours,\r\naristocratic to the backbone,--a very Duchess of duchesses? The role\r\nwould be one very easy to play. It required rank, money, and a little\r\nmanner,--and these she possessed. The old Duke had done it with ease,\r\nwithout the slightest trouble to himself, and had been treated almost\r\nlike a god because he had secluded himself. She could make the change\r\neven yet,--and as her husband told her that she was vulgar, she\r\nthought she would make it.\r\n\r\nBut at last, before she had abandoned her desk and paper, there had\r\ncome to her another thought. Nothing to her was so distasteful as\r\nfailure. She had known that there would be difficulties, and had\r\nassured herself that she would be firm and brave in overcoming them.\r\nWas not this accusation of vulgarity simply one of the difficulties\r\nwhich she had to overcome? Was her courage already gone from her? Was\r\nshe so weak that a single word should knock her over,--and a word\r\nevidently repented of as soon as uttered? Vulgar! Well;--let her be\r\nvulgar as long as she gained her object. There had been no penalty of\r\neverlasting punishment denounced against vulgarity. And then a higher\r\nidea touched her, not without effect,--an idea which she could not\r\nanalyse, but which was hardly on that account the less effective. She\r\ndid believe thoroughly in her husband, to the extent of thinking him\r\nthe fittest man in all the country to be its Prime Minister. His fame\r\nwas dear to her. Her nature was loyal; and though she might, perhaps,\r\nin her younger days have been able to lean upon him with a more\r\nloving heart had he been other than he was, brighter, more gay, given\r\nto pleasures, and fond of trifles, still, she could recognise merits\r\nwith which her sympathy was imperfect. It was good that he should be\r\nEngland\'s Prime Minister, and therefore she would do all she could to\r\nkeep him in that place. The vulgarity was a necessary essential. He\r\nmight not acknowledge this,--might even, if the choice were left to\r\nhim, refuse to be Prime Minister on such terms. But she need not,\r\ntherefore, give way. Having in this way thought it all out, she took\r\nup her pen and completed the batch of letters before she allowed\r\nherself to go to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSir Orlando\'s Policy\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the guests began to arrive our friend the Duchess had apparently\r\ngot through her little difficulties, for she received them with that\r\nopen, genial hospitality which is so delightful as coming evidently\r\nfrom the heart. There had not been another word between her and her\r\nhusband as to the manner in which the thing was to be done, and she\r\nhad determined that the offensive word should pass altogether out of\r\nher memory. The first comer was Mrs. Finn,--who came indeed rather\r\nas an assistant hostess than as a mere guest, and to her the Duchess\r\nuttered a few half-playful hints as to her troubles. "Considering the\r\ntime, haven\'t we done marvels? Because it does look nice,--doesn\'t\r\nit? There are no dirt heaps about, and it\'s all as green as though\r\nit had been there since the Conquest. He doesn\'t like it because it\r\nlooks new. And we\'ve got forty-five bedrooms made up. The servants\r\nare all turned out over the stables somewhere,--quite comfortable,\r\nI assure you. Indeed they like it. And by knocking down the ends of\r\ntwo passages we\'ve brought everything together. And the rooms are all\r\nnumbered just like an inn. It was the only way. And I keep one book\r\nmyself, and Locock has another. I have everybody\'s room, and where it\r\nis, and how long the tenant is to be allowed to occupy it. And here\'s\r\nthe way everybody is to take everybody down to dinner for the next\r\nfortnight. Of course that must be altered, but it is easier when we\r\nhave a sort of settled basis. And I have some private notes as to who\r\nshould flirt with whom."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better not let that lie about."\r\n\r\n"Nobody could understand a word of it if they had it. A. B. always\r\nmeans X. Y. Z. And this is the code of the Gatherum Archery Ground.\r\nI never drew a bow in my life,--not a real bow in the flesh, that is,\r\nmy dear,--and yet I\'ve made \'em all out, and had them printed. The\r\nway to make a thing go down is to give it some special importance.\r\nAnd I\'ve gone through the bill of fare for the first week with\r\nMillepois, who is a perfect gentleman,--perfect." Then she gave a\r\nlittle sigh as she remembered that word from her husband, which had\r\nso wounded her. "I used to think that Plantagenet worked hard when he\r\nwas doing his decimal coinage; but I don\'t think he ever stuck to it\r\nas I have done."\r\n\r\n"What does the Duke say to it all?"\r\n\r\n"Ah; well, upon the whole he behaves like an angel. He behaves so\r\nwell that half my time I think I\'ll shut it all up and have done with\r\nit,--for his sake. And then, the other half, I\'m determined to go on\r\nwith it,--also for his sake."\r\n\r\n"He has not been displeased?"\r\n\r\n"Ask no questions, my dear, and you\'ll hear no stories. You haven\'t\r\nbeen married twice without knowing that women can\'t have everything\r\nsmooth. He only said one word. It was rather hard to bear, but it has\r\npassed away."\r\n\r\nThat afternoon there was quite a crowd. Among the first comers were\r\nMr. and Mrs. Roby, and Mr. and Mrs. Rattler. And there were Sir\r\nOrlando and Lady Drought, Lord Ramsden, and Sir Timothy Beeswax.\r\nThese gentlemen with their wives represented, for the time, the\r\nMinistry of which the Duke was the head, and had been asked in order\r\nthat their fealty and submission might be thus riveted. There were\r\nalso there Mr. and Mrs. Boffin, with Lord Thrift and his daughter\r\nAngelica, who had belonged to former Ministries,--one on the Liberal\r\nand the other on the Conservative side,--and who were now among the\r\nDuke\'s guests, in order that they and others might see how wide the\r\nDuke wished to open his hands. And there was our friend Ferdinand\r\nLopez, who had certainly made the best use of his opportunities in\r\nsecuring for himself so great a social advantage as an invitation to\r\nGatherum Castle. How could any father, who was simply a barrister,\r\nrefuse to receive as his son-in-law a man who had been a guest at the\r\nDuke of Omnium\'s country house? And then there were certain people\r\nfrom the neighbourhood;--Frank Gresham of Greshamsbury, with his wife\r\nand daughter, the master of the hounds in those parts, a rich squire\r\nof old blood, and head of the family to which one of the aspirant\r\nPrime Ministers of the day belonged. And Lord Chiltern, another\r\nmaster of fox hounds, two counties off,--and also an old friend of\r\nours,--had been asked to meet him, and had brought his wife. And\r\nthere was Lady Rosina De Courcy, an old maid, the sister of the\r\npresent Earl De Courcy, who lived not far off and had been accustomed\r\nto come to Gatherum Castle on state occasions for the last thirty\r\nyears,--the only relic in those parts of a family which had lived\r\nthere for many years in great pride of place; for her elder brother,\r\nthe Earl, was a ruined man, and her younger brothers were living with\r\ntheir wives abroad, and her sisters had married, rather lowly in the\r\nworld, and her mother now was dead, and Lady Rosina lived alone in\r\na little cottage outside the old park palings, and still held fast\r\nwithin her bosom all the old pride of the De Courcys. And then\r\nthere were Captain Gunner and Major Pountney, two middle-aged young\r\nmen, presumably belonging to the army, whom the Duchess had lately\r\nenlisted among her followers as being useful in their way. They could\r\neat their dinners without being shy, dance on occasions, though very\r\nunwillingly, talk a little, and run on messages;--and they knew the\r\npeerage by heart, and could tell the details of every unfortunate\r\nmarriage for the last twenty years. Each thought himself, especially\r\nsince this last promotion, to be indispensably necessary to the\r\nformation of London society, and was comfortable in a conviction that\r\nhe had thoroughly succeeded in life by acquiring the privilege of\r\nsitting down to dinner three times a week with peers and peeresses.\r\n\r\nThe list of guests has by no means been made as complete here as it\r\nwas to be found in the county newspapers, and in the "Morning Post"\r\nof the time; but enough of names has been given to show of what\r\nnature was the party. "The Duchess has got rather a rough lot to\r\nbegin with," said the Major to the Captain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I knew that. She wanted me to be useful, so of course I\r\ncame. I shall stay here this week, and then be back in September."\r\nUp to this moment Captain Gunner had not received any invitation for\r\nSeptember, but then there was no reason why he should not do so.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been getting up that archery code with her," said Pountney,\r\n"and I was pledged to come down and set it going. That little Gresham\r\ngirl isn\'t a bad looking thing."\r\n\r\n"Rather flabby," said Captain Gunner.\r\n\r\n"Very nice colour. She\'ll have a lot of money, you know."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a brother," said the Captain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; there\'s a brother, who will have the Greshamsbury property,\r\nbut she\'s to have her mother\'s money. There\'s a very odd story about\r\nall that, you know." Then the Major told the story, and told every\r\nparticular of it wrongly. "A man might do worse than look there,"\r\nsaid the Major. A man might have done worse, because Miss Gresham was\r\na very nice girl; but of course the Major was all wrong about the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n"Well;--now you\'ve tried it, what do you think about it?" This\r\nquestion was put by Sir Timothy to Sir Orlando as they sat in a\r\ncorner of the archery ground, under the shelter of a tent, looking\r\non while Major Pountney taught Mrs. Boffin how to fix an arrow to\r\nher bowstring. It was quite understood that Sir Timothy was inimical\r\nto the Coalition though he still belonged to it, and that he would\r\nassist in breaking it up if only there were a fair chance of his\r\nbelonging to the party which would remain in power. Sir Timothy\r\nhad been badly treated, and did not forget it. Now Sir Orlando had\r\nalso of late shown some symptoms of a disturbed ambition. He was\r\nthe Leader of the House of Commons, and it had become an almost\r\nrecognised law of the Constitution that the Leader of the House of\r\nCommons should be the First Minister of the Crown. It was at least\r\nunderstood by many that such was Sir Orlando\'s reading of the laws of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got along, you know," said Sir Orlando.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--yes. We\'ve got along. Can you imagine any possible\r\nconcatenation of circumstances in which we should not get along?\r\nThere\'s always too much good sense in the House for an absolute\r\ncollapse. But are you contented?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t say I\'m not," said the cautious baronet. "I didn\'t look for\r\nvery great things from a Coalition, and I didn\'t look for very great\r\nthings from the Duke."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that the one achievement to which we\'ve all looked\r\nhas been the reaching the end of the Session in safety. We\'ve done\r\nthat certainly."\r\n\r\n"It is a great thing to do, Sir Timothy. Of course the main work of\r\nParliament is to raise supplies;--and, when that has been done with\r\nease, when all the money wanted has been voted without a break-down,\r\nof course Ministers are very glad to get rid of the Parliament. It is\r\nas much a matter of course that a Minister should dislike Parliament\r\nnow as that a Stuart King should have done so two hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago. To get a Session over and done with is an achievement and\r\na delight."\r\n\r\n"No Ministry can go on long on that far niente principle, and no\r\nminister who accedes to it will remain long in any ministry."\r\nSir Timothy in saying this might be alluding to the Duke, or the\r\nreference might be to Sir Orlando himself. "Of course, I\'m not in\r\nthe Cabinet, and am not entitled to say a word; but I think that if\r\nI were in the Cabinet, and if I were anxious,--which I confess I\'m\r\nnot,--for a continuation of the present state of things, I should\r\nendeavour to obtain from the Duke some idea of his policy for the\r\nnext Session." Sir Orlando was a man of certain parts. He could speak\r\nvolubly,--and yet slowly,--so that reporters and others could hear\r\nhim. He was patient, both in the House and in his office, and had the\r\ngreat gift of doing what he was told by men who understood things\r\nbetter than he did himself. He never went very far astray in his\r\nofficial business, because he always obeyed the clerks and followed\r\nprecedents. He had been a useful man,--and would still have remained\r\nso had he not been lifted a little too high. Had he been only one in\r\nthe ruck on the Treasury Bench he would have been useful to the end;\r\nbut special honour and special place had been assigned to him, and\r\ntherefore he desired still bigger things. The Duke\'s mediocrity of\r\ntalent and of energy and of general governing power had been so often\r\nmentioned of late in Sir Orlando\'s hearing, that Sir Orlando had\r\ngradually come to think that he was the Duke\'s equal in the Cabinet,\r\nand that perhaps it behoved him to lead the Duke. At the commencement\r\nof their joint operations he had held the Duke in some awe, and\r\nperhaps something of that feeling in reference to the Duke personally\r\nstill restrained him. The Dukes of Omnium had always been big people.\r\nBut still it might be his duty to say a word to the Duke. Sir Orlando\r\nassured himself that if ever convinced of the propriety of doing so,\r\nhe could say a word even to the Duke of Omnium. "I am confident that\r\nwe should not go on quite as we are at present," said Sir Timothy as\r\nhe closed the conversation.\r\n\r\n"Where did they pick him up?" said the Major to the Captain, pointing\r\nwith his head to Ferdinand Lopez, who was shooting with Angelica\r\nThrift and Mr. Boffin and one of the Duke\'s private secretaries.\r\n\r\n"The Duchess found him somewhere. He\'s one of those fabulously rich\r\nfellows out of the City who make a hundred thousand pounds at a blow.\r\nThey say his people were grandees of Spain."\r\n\r\n"Does anybody know him?" asked the Major.\r\n\r\n"Everybody soon will know him," answered the Captain. "I think I\r\nheard that he\'s going to stand for some place in the Duke\'s interest.\r\nHe don\'t look the sort of fellow I like; but he\'s got money and\r\nhe comes here, and he\'s good looking,--and therefore he\'ll be a\r\nsuccess." In answer to this the Major only grunted. The Major was a\r\nyear or two older than the Captain, and therefore less willing even\r\nthan his friend to admit the claims of new comers to social honours.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment the Duchess walked across the ground up to the\r\nshooters, accompanied by Mrs. Finn and Lady Chiltern. She had not\r\nbeen seen in the gardens before that day, and of course a little\r\nconcourse was made round her. The Major and the Captain, who had been\r\ndriven away by the success of Ferdinand Lopez, returned with their\r\nsweetest smiles. Mr. Boffin put down his treatise on the nature of\r\nFranchises, which he was studying in order that he might lead an\r\nopposition against the Ministry next Session, and even Sir Timothy\r\nBeeswax, who had done his work with Sir Orlando, joined the throng.\r\n\r\n"Now I do hope," said the Duchess, "that you are all shooting by the\r\nnew code. That is, and is to be, the Gatherum Archery Code, and I\r\nshall break my heart if anybody rebels."\r\n\r\n"There are one or two men," said Major Pountney very gravely, "who\r\nwon\'t take the trouble to understand it."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lopez," said the Duchess, pointing with her finger at our\r\nfriend, "are you that rebel?"\r\n\r\n"I fear I did suggest--" began Mr. Lopez.\r\n\r\n"I will have no suggestions,--nothing but obedience. Here are Sir\r\nTimothy Beeswax and Mr. Boffin, and Sir Orlando Drought is not far\r\noff; and here is Mr. Rattler, than whom no authority on such a\r\nsubject can be better. Ask them whether in other matters suggestions\r\nare wanted."\r\n\r\n"Of course not," said Major Pountney.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Lopez, will you or will you not be guided by a strict and\r\nclose interpretation of the Gatherum Code? Because, if not, I\'m\r\nafraid we shall feel constrained to accept your resignation."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t resign, and I will obey," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"A good ministerial reply," said the Duchess. "I don\'t doubt but\r\nthat in time you\'ll ascend to high office and become a pillar of the\r\nGatherum constitution. How does he shoot, Miss Thrift?"\r\n\r\n"He will shoot very well indeed, Duchess, if he goes on and\r\npractises," said Angelica, whose life for the last seven years had\r\nbeen devoted to archery. Major Pountney retired far away into the\r\npark, a full quarter of a mile off, and smoked a cigar under a tree.\r\nWas it for this that he had absolutely given up a month to drawing\r\nout this code of rules, going backwards and forwards two or three\r\ntimes to the printers in his desire to carry out the Duchess\'s\r\nwishes? "Women are so d---- ungrateful!" he said aloud in his\r\nsolitude, as he turned himself on the hard ground. "And some men are\r\nso d---- lucky!" This fellow, Lopez, had absolutely been allowed to\r\nmake a good score off his own intractable disobedience.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess\'s little joke about the Ministers generally, and the\r\nadvantages of submission on their part to their chief, was thought by\r\nsome who heard it not to have been made in good taste. The joke was\r\njust such a joke as the Duchess would be sure to make,--meaning very\r\nlittle but still not altogether pointless. It was levelled rather at\r\nher husband than at her husband\'s colleagues who were present, and\r\nwas so understood by those who really knew her,--as did Mrs. Finn,\r\nand Mr. Warburton, the private secretary. But Sir Orlando and Sir\r\nTimothy and Mr. Rattler, who were all within hearing, thought that\r\nthe Duchess had intended to allude to the servile nature of their\r\nposition; and Mr. Boffin, who heard it, rejoiced within himself,\r\ncomforting himself with the reflection that his withers were unwrung,\r\nand thinking with what pleasure he might carry the anecdote into the\r\nfarthest corners of the clubs. Poor Duchess! \'Tis pitiful to think\r\nthat after such Herculean labours she should injure the cause by one\r\nslight unconsidered word, more, perhaps, than she had advanced it by\r\nall her energy.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the Duke was at the Castle, but he showed himself\r\nseldom to his guests,--so acting, as the reader will I hope\r\nunderstand, from no sense of the importance of his own personal\r\npresence, but influenced by a conviction that a public man should not\r\nwaste his time. He breakfasted in his own room, because he could thus\r\neat his breakfast in ten minutes. He read all the papers in solitude,\r\nbecause he was thus enabled to give his mind to their contents. Life\r\nhad always been too serious to him to be wasted. Every afternoon\r\nhe walked for the sake of exercise, and would have accepted any\r\ncompanion if any companion had especially offered himself. But he\r\nwent off by some side-door, finding the side-door to be convenient,\r\nand therefore when seen by others was supposed to desire to remain\r\nunseen. "I had no idea there was so much pride about the Duke," Mr.\r\nBoffin said to his old colleague, Sir Orlando. "Is it pride?" asked\r\nSir Orlando. "It may be shyness," said the wise Boffin. "The two\r\nthings are so alike you can never tell the difference. But the man\r\nwho is cursed by either should hardly be a Prime Minister."\r\n\r\nIt was on the day after this that Sir Orlando thought that the moment\r\nhad come in which it was his duty to say that salutary word to the\r\nDuke which it was clearly necessary that some colleague should say,\r\nand which no colleague could have so good a right to say as he who\r\nwas the Leader of the House of Commons. He understood clearly that\r\nthough they were gathered together then at Gatherum Castle for\r\nfestive purposes, yet that no time was unfit for the discussion of\r\nState matters. Does not all the world know that when in autumn the\r\nBismarcks of the world, or they who are bigger than Bismarcks, meet\r\nat this or that delicious haunt of salubrity, the affairs of the\r\nworld are then settled in little conclaves, with greater ease,\r\nrapidity, and certainty than in large parliaments or the dull\r\nchambers of public offices? Emperor meets Emperor, and King meets\r\nKing, and as they wander among rural glades in fraternal intimacy,\r\nwars are arranged, and swelling territories are enjoyed in\r\nanticipation. Sir Orlando hitherto had known all this, but had hardly\r\nas yet enjoyed it. He had been long in office, but these sweet\r\nconfidences can of their very nature belong only to a very few. But\r\nnow the time had manifestly come.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday afternoon, and Sir Orlando caught the Duke in the very\r\nact of leaving the house for his walk. There was no archery, and many\r\nof the inmates of the Castle were asleep. There had been a question\r\nas to the propriety of Sabbath archery, in discussing which reference\r\nhad been made to Laud\'s book of sports, and the growing idea that the\r\nNational Gallery should be opened on the Lord\'s-day. But the Duchess\r\nwould not have the archery. "We are just the people who shouldn\'t\r\nprejudge the question," said the Duchess. The Duchess with various\r\nladies, with the Pountneys and Gunners, and other obedient male\r\nfollowers, had been to church. None of the Ministers had of course\r\nbeen able to leave the swollen pouches which are always sent out\r\nfrom London on Saturday night, probably,--we cannot but think,--as\r\narranged excuses for such defalcation, and had passed their mornings\r\ncomfortably dozing over new novels. The Duke, always right in his\r\npurpose but generally wrong in his practice, had stayed at home\r\nworking all the morning, thereby scandalising the strict, and had\r\ngone to church alone in the afternoon, thereby offending the social.\r\nThe church was close to the house, and he had gone back to change his\r\ncoat and hat, and to get his stick. But as he was stealing out of the\r\nlittle side-gate, Sir Orlando was down upon him. "If your Grace is\r\ngoing for a walk, and will admit of company, I shall be delighted to\r\nattend you," said Sir Orlando. The Duke professed himself to be well\r\npleased, and in truth was pleased. He would be glad to increase his\r\npersonal intimacy with his colleagues if it might be done pleasantly.\r\n\r\nThey had gone nearly a mile across the park, watching the stately\r\nmovements of the herds of deer, and talking of this and that trifle,\r\nbefore Sir Orlando could bring about an opportunity for uttering his\r\nword. At last he did it somewhat abruptly. "I think upon the whole we\r\ndid pretty well last Session," he said, standing still under an old\r\noak-tree.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well," re-echoed the Duke.\r\n\r\n"And I suppose we have not much to be afraid of next Session?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid of nothing," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"But--;" then Sir Orlando hesitated. The Duke, however, said not a\r\nword to help him on. Sir Orlando thought that the Duke looked more\r\nducal than he had ever seen him look before. Sir Orlando remembered\r\nthe old Duke, and suddenly found that the uncle and nephew were very\r\nlike each other. But it does not become the Leader of the House of\r\nCommons to be afraid of any one. "Don\'t you think," continued Sir\r\nOrlando, "we should try and arrange among ourselves something of a\r\npolicy? I am not quite sure that a ministry without a distinct course\r\nof action before it can long enjoy the confidence of the country.\r\nTake the last half century. There have been various policies,\r\ncommanding more or less of general assent; free trade--." Here Sir\r\nOrlando gave a kindly wave of his hand, showing that on behalf of his\r\ncompanion he was willing to place at the head of the list a policy\r\nwhich had not always commanded his own assent;--"continued reform\r\nin Parliament, to which I have, with my whole heart, given my poor\r\nassistance." The Duke remembered how the bathers\' clothes were\r\nstolen, and that Sir Orlando had been one of the most nimble-fingered\r\nof the thieves. "No popery, Irish grievances, the ballot,\r\nretrenchment, efficiency of the public service, all have had their\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Things to be done offer themselves, I suppose, because they are in\r\nthemselves desirable; not because it is desirable to have something\r\nto do."\r\n\r\n"Just so;--no doubt. But still, if you will think of it, no ministry\r\ncan endure without a policy. During the latter part of the last\r\nSession it was understood that we had to get ourselves in harness\r\ntogether, and nothing more was expected from us; but I think we\r\nshould be prepared with a distinct policy for the coming year. I fear\r\nthat nothing can be done in Ireland."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn has ideas--."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes;--well, your Grace. Mr. Finn is a very clever young man\r\ncertainly; but I don\'t think we can support ourselves by his plan of\r\nIrish reform." Sir Orlando had been a little carried away by his own\r\neloquence and the Duke\'s tameness, and had interrupted the Duke. The\r\nDuke again looked ducal, but on this occasion Sir Orlando did not\r\nobserve his countenance. "For myself, I think, I am in favour of\r\nincreased armaments. I have been applying my mind to the subject,\r\nand I think I see that the people of this country do not object to a\r\nslightly rising scale of estimates in that direction. Of course there\r\nis the county suffrage--"\r\n\r\n"I will think of what you have been saying," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"As to the county suffrage--"\r\n\r\n"I will think it over," said the Duke. "You see that oak. That is the\r\nlargest tree we have here at Gatherum; and I doubt whether there be a\r\nlarger one in this part of England." The Duke\'s voice and words were\r\nnot uncourteous, but there was something in them which hindered Sir\r\nOrlando from referring again on that occasion to county suffrages or\r\nincreased armaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nThe Duchess\'s New Swan\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the party had been about a week collected at Gatherum Castle,\r\nFerdinand Lopez had manifestly become the favourite of the Duchess\r\nfor the time, and had, at her instance, promised to remain there for\r\nsome further days. He had hardly spoken to the Duke since he had been\r\nin the house,--but then but few of that motley assembly did talk much\r\nwith the Duke. Gunner and Pountney had gone away,--the Captain having\r\ndeclared his dislike of the upstart Portuguese to be so strong that\r\nhe could not stay in the same house with him any longer, and the\r\nMajor, who was of stronger mind, having resolved that he would put\r\nthe intruder down. "It is horrible to think what power money has in\r\nthese days," said the Captain. The Captain had shaken the dust of\r\nGatherum altogether from his feet, but the Major had so arranged that\r\na bed was to be found for him again in October,--for another happy\r\nweek; but he was not to return till bidden by the Duchess. "You won\'t\r\nforget;--now will you, Duchess?" he said, imploring her to remember\r\nhim as he took his leave. "I did take a deal of trouble about the\r\ncode;--didn\'t I?" "They don\'t seem to me to care for the code," said\r\nthe Duchess, "but, nevertheless, I\'ll remember."\r\n\r\n"Who, in the name of all that\'s wonderful, was that I saw you with in\r\nthe garden?" the Duchess said to her husband one afternoon.\r\n\r\n"It was Lady Rosina De Courcy, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Heaven and earth!--what a companion for you to choose."\r\n\r\n"Why not?--why shouldn\'t I talk to Lady Rosina De Courcy?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not jealous a bit, if you mean that. I don\'t think Lady Rosina\r\nwill steal your heart from me. But why you should pick her out of all\r\nthe people here, when there are so many would think their fortunes\r\nmade if you would only take a turn with them, I cannot imagine."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want to make any one\'s fortune," said the Duke; "and\r\ncertainly not in that way."\r\n\r\n"What could you be saying to her?"\r\n\r\n"She was talking about her family. I rather like Lady Rosina. She\r\nis living all alone, it seems, and almost in poverty. Perhaps there\r\nis nothing so sad in the world as the female scions of a noble but\r\nimpoverished stock."\r\n\r\n"Nothing so dull, certainly."\r\n\r\n"People are not dull to me, if they are real. I pity that poor lady.\r\nShe is proud of her blood and yet not ashamed of her poverty."\r\n\r\n"Whatever might come of her blood, she has been all her life willing\r\nenough to get rid of her poverty. It isn\'t above three years since\r\nshe was trying her best to marry that brewer at Silverbridge. I wish\r\nyou could give your time a little to some of the other people."\r\n\r\n"To go and shoot arrows?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I don\'t want you to shoot arrows. You might act the part of\r\nhost without shooting. Can\'t you walk about with anybody except Lady\r\nRosina De Courcy?"\r\n\r\n"I was walking about with Sir Orlando Drought last Sunday, and I very\r\nmuch prefer Lady Rosina."\r\n\r\n"There has been no quarrel?" asked the Duchess sharply.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no."\r\n\r\n"Of course he\'s an empty-headed idiot. Everybody has always known\r\nthat. And he\'s put above his place in the House. But it wouldn\'t do\r\nto quarrel with him now."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I am a quarrelsome man, Cora. I don\'t remember at this\r\nmoment that I have ever quarrelled with anybody to your knowledge.\r\nBut I may perhaps be permitted to--"\r\n\r\n"Snub a man, you mean. Well, I wouldn\'t even snub Sir Orlando very\r\nmuch, if I were you; though I can understand that it might be both\r\npleasant and easy."\r\n\r\n"I wish you wouldn\'t put slang phrases into my mouth, Cora. If I\r\nthink that a man intrudes upon me, I am of course bound to let him\r\nknow my opinion."\r\n\r\n"Sir Orlando has--intruded!"\r\n\r\n"By no means. He is in a position which justifies his saying many\r\nthings to me which another might not say. But then, again, he is a\r\nman whose opinion does not go far with me, and I have not the knack\r\nof seeming to agree with a man while I let his words pass idly by\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"That is quite true, Plantagenet."\r\n\r\n"And, therefore, I was uncomfortable with Sir Orlando, while I was\r\nable to sympathise with Lady Rosina."\r\n\r\n"What do you think of Ferdinand Lopez?" asked the Duchess, with\r\nstudied abruptness.\r\n\r\n"Think of Mr. Lopez! I haven\'t thought of him at all. Why should I\r\nthink of him?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to think of him. I think he\'s a very pleasant fellow, and\r\nI\'m sure he\'s a rising man."\r\n\r\n"You might think the latter, and perhaps feel sure of the former."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Then, to oblige you, I\'ll think the latter and feel sure\r\nof the former. I suppose it\'s true that Mr. Grey is going on this\r\nmission to Persia?" Mr. Grey was the Duke\'s intimate friend, and was\r\nat this time member for the neighbouring borough of Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I think he will go. I\'ve no doubt about it. He is to go after\r\nChristmas."\r\n\r\n"And will give up his seat?"\r\n\r\nThe Duke did not answer her immediately. It had only just been\r\ndecided,--decided by his friend himself,--that the seat should\r\nbe given up when the journey to Persia was undertaken. Mr. Grey,\r\nsomewhat in opposition to the Duke\'s advice, had resolved that he\r\ncould not be in Persia and do his duty in the House of Commons at the\r\nsame time. But this resolution had only now been made known to the\r\nDuke, and he was rather puzzled to think how the Duchess had been\r\nable to be so quick upon him. He had, indeed, kept the matter back\r\nfrom the Duchess, feeling that she would have something to say about\r\nit, which might possibly be unpleasant, as soon as the tidings should\r\nreach her. "Yes," he said, "I think he will give up his seat. That is\r\nhis purpose, though I think it is unnecessary."\r\n\r\n"Let Mr. Lopez have it."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lopez!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he is a clever man, a rising man, a man that is sure to do\r\nwell, and who will be of use to you. Just take the trouble to talk to\r\nhim. It is assistance of that kind that you want. You Ministers go on\r\nshuffling the old cards till they are so worn out and dirty that one\r\ncan hardly tell the pips on them."\r\n\r\n"I am one of the dirty old cards myself," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, you know. A man who is at the head of affairs as\r\nyou are can\'t be included among the pack I am speaking of. What you\r\nwant is new blood, or new wood, or new metal, or whatever you may\r\nchoose to call it. Take my advice and try this man. He isn\'t a\r\npauper. It isn\'t money that he wants."\r\n\r\n"Cora, your geese are all swans."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not fair. I have never brought to you a goose yet. My swans\r\nhave been swans. Who was it brought you and your pet swan of all, Mr.\r\nGrey, together? I won\'t name any names, but it is your swans have\r\nbeen geese."\r\n\r\n"It is not for me to return a member for Silverbridge." When he said\r\nthis, she gave him a look which almost upset even his gravity, a look\r\nwhich was almost the same as asking him whether he would not--"tell\r\nthat to the marines." "You don\'t quite understand these things,\r\nCora," he continued. "The influence which owners of property may have\r\nin boroughs is decreasing every day, and there arises the question\r\nwhether a conscientious man will any longer use such influence."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you\'d like to see a man from Silverbridge opposing you\r\nin the House."\r\n\r\n"I may have to bear worse even than that."\r\n\r\n"Well;--there it is. The man is here and you have the opportunity of\r\nknowing him. Of course I have not hinted at the matter to him. If\r\nthere were any Palliser wanted the borough I wouldn\'t say a word.\r\nWhat more patriotic thing can a patron do with his borough than to\r\nselect a man who is unknown to him, not related to him, a perfect\r\nstranger, merely for his worth?"\r\n\r\n"But I do not know what may be the worth of Mr. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"I will guarantee that," said the Duchess. Whereupon the Duke\r\nlaughed, and then left her.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess had spoken with absolute truth when she told her husband\r\nthat she had not said a word to Mr. Lopez about Silverbridge, but it\r\nwas not long before she did say a word. On that same day she found\r\nherself alone with him in the garden,--or so much alone as to be\r\nable to speak with him privately. He had certainly made the best\r\nuse of his time since he had been at the Castle, having secured the\r\ngood-will of many of the ladies, and the displeasure of most of the\r\nmen. "You have never been in Parliament, I think," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"I have never even tried to get there."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you dislike the idea of that kind of life."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," he said. "So far from it, that I regard it as the\r\nhighest kind of life there is in England. A seat in Parliament gives\r\na man a status in this country which it has never done elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t you try it?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'ve got into another groove. I\'ve become essentially a city\r\nman,--one of those who take up the trade of making money generally."\r\n\r\n"And does that content you?"\r\n\r\n"No, Duchess;--certainly not. Instead of contenting me it disgusts\r\nme. Not but that I like the money,--only it is so insufficient a use\r\nof one\'s life. I suppose I shall try to get into Parliament some day.\r\nSeats in Parliament don\'t grow like blackberries on bushes."\r\n\r\n"Pretty nearly," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Not in my part of the country. These good things seem to be\r\nappointed to fall in the way of some men, and not of others. If there\r\nwere a general election going on to-morrow, I should not know how to\r\nlook for a seat."\r\n\r\n"They are to be found sometimes even without a general election,"\r\nsaid the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Are you alluding to anything now?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes, I am. But I\'m very discreet, and do not like to do more\r\nthan allude. I fancy that Mr. Grey, the member for Silverbridge,\r\nis going to Persia. Mr. Grey is a Member of Parliament. Members of\r\nParliament ought to be in London and not in Persia. It is generally\r\nsupposed that no man in England is more prone to do what he ought to\r\ndo than Mr. Grey. Therefore, Mr. Grey will cease to be Member for\r\nSilverbridge. That\'s logic; isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Has your Grace any logic equally strong to prove that I can follow\r\nhim in the borough?"\r\n\r\n"No;--or if I have, the logic that I should use in that matter must\r\nfor the present be kept to myself." She certainly had a little\r\nsyllogism in her head as to the Duke ruling the borough, the Duke\'s\r\nwife ruling the Duke, and therefore the Duke\'s wife ruling the\r\nborough; but she did not think it prudent to utter this on the\r\npresent occasion. "I think it much better that men in Parliament\r\nshould be unmarried," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"But I am going to be married," said he.\r\n\r\n"Going to be married, are you?"\r\n\r\n"I have no right to say so, because the lady\'s father has rejected\r\nme." Then he told her the whole story, and so told it as to secure\r\nher entire sympathy. In telling it he never said that he was a rich\r\nman, he never boasted that that search after wealth of which he had\r\nspoken, had been successful; but he gave her to understand that there\r\nwas no objection to him at all on the score of money. "You may have\r\nheard of the family," he said.\r\n\r\n"I have heard of the Whartons of course, and know that there is a\r\nbaronet,--but I know nothing more of them. He is not a man of large\r\nproperty, I think."\r\n\r\n"My Miss Wharton,--the one I would fain call mine,--is the daughter\r\nof a London barrister. He, I believe, is rich."\r\n\r\n"Then she will be an heiress."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so;--but that consideration has had no weight with me. I\r\nhave always regarded myself as the architect of my own fortune, and\r\nhave no wish to owe my material comfort to a wife."\r\n\r\n"Sheer love!" suggested the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so. It\'s very ridiculous; is it not?"\r\n\r\n"And why does the rich barrister object?"\r\n\r\n"The rich barrister, Duchess, is an out and out old Tory, who thinks\r\nthat his daughter ought to marry no one but an English Tory. I am not\r\nexactly that."\r\n\r\n"A man does not hamper his daughter in these days by politics, when\r\nshe is falling in love."\r\n\r\n"There are other cognate reasons. He does not like a foreigner. Now I\r\nam an Englishman, but I have a foreign name. He does not think that a\r\nname so grandly Saxon as Wharton should be changed to one so meanly\r\nLatin as Lopez."\r\n\r\n"The lady does not object to the Latinity?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy not."\r\n\r\n"Or to the bearer of it?"\r\n\r\n"Ah;--there I must not boast. But in simple truth there is only the\r\nfather\'s ill-will between us."\r\n\r\n"With plenty of money on both sides?" asked the Duchess. Lopez\r\nshrugged his shoulders. A shrug at such a time may mean anything,\r\nbut the Duchess took this shrug as signifying that the question was\r\nso surely settled as to admit of no difficulty. "Then," said the\r\nDuchess, "the old gentleman may as well give way at once. Of course\r\nhis daughter will be too many for him." In this way the Duchess of\r\nOmnium became the fast friend of Ferdinand Lopez.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nSt. James\'s Park\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of September Everett Wharton and Ferdinand Lopez were\r\nin town together, and as no one else was in town,--so at least they\r\nboth professed to say,--they saw a good deal of each other. Lopez,\r\nas we know, had spent a portion of the preceding month at Gatherum\r\nCastle, and had made good use of his time, but Everett Wharton had\r\nbeen less fortunate. He had been a little cross with his father, and\r\nperhaps a little cross with all the Whartons generally, who did not,\r\nhe thought, make quite enough of him. In the event of "anything\r\nhappening" to that ne\'er-do-well nephew, he himself would be the\r\nheir; and he reflected not unfrequently that something very probably\r\nmight happen to the nephew. He did not often see this particular\r\ncousin, but he always heard of him as being drunk, overwhelmed with\r\ndebt and difficulty, and altogether in that position of life in\r\nwhich it is probable that something will "happen." There was always\r\nof course the danger that the young man might marry and have a\r\nchild;--but in the meantime surely he, Everett Wharton, should have\r\nbeen as much thought of on the banks of the Wye as Arthur Fletcher.\r\nHe had been asked down to Wharton Hall,--but he had been asked in a\r\nway which he had not thought to be flattering and had declined to go.\r\nThen there had been a plan for joining Arthur Fletcher in a certain\r\nshooting, but that had failed in consequence of a few words between\r\nhimself and Arthur respecting Lopez. Arthur had wanted him to say\r\nthat Lopez was an unpardonable intruder,--but he had taken the part\r\nof Lopez, and therefore, when the time came round, he had nothing\r\nto do with the shooting. He had stayed in town till the middle of\r\nAugust, and had then started by himself across the continent with\r\nsome keen intention of studying German politics; but he had found\r\nperhaps that German politics do not manifest themselves in the\r\nautumn, or that a foreign country cannot be well studied in\r\nsolitude,--and he had returned.\r\n\r\nLate in the summer, just before his father and sister had left town,\r\nhe had had some words with the old barrister. There had been a few\r\nbills to be paid, and Everett\'s allowance had been insufficient. It\r\noften was insufficient, and then ready money for his German tour\r\nwas absolutely necessary. Mr. Wharton might probably have said less\r\nabout the money had not his son accompanied his petition by a further\r\nallusion to Parliament. "There are some fellows at last really\r\ngetting themselves together at the Progress, and of course it will\r\nbe necessary to know who will be ready to come forward at the next\r\ngeneral election."\r\n\r\n"I think I know one who won\'t," said the father, "judging from the\r\nmanner in which he seems at present to manage his own money affairs."\r\nThere was more severity in this than the old man had intended, for\r\nhe had often thought within his own bosom whether it would not be\r\nwell that he should encourage his son to stand for some seat. And\r\nthe money that he had now been asked to advance had not been very\r\nmuch,--not more, in truth, than he expected to be called upon to pay\r\nin addition to the modest sum which he professed to allow his son. He\r\nwas a rich man, who was not in truth made unhappy by parting with his\r\nmoney. But there had been, he thought, an impudence in the conjoint\r\nattack which it was his duty to punish. Therefore he had given his\r\nson very little encouragement.\r\n\r\n"Of course, sir, if you tell me that you are not inclined to pay\r\nanything beyond the allowance you make me, there is an end of it."\r\n\r\n"I rather think that you have just asked me to pay a considerable sum\r\nbeyond your allowance, and that I have consented." Everett argued the\r\nmatter no further, but he permitted his mind to entertain an idea\r\nthat he was ill-used by his father. The time would come when he\r\nwould probably be heir not only to his father\'s money, but also to\r\nthe Wharton title and the Wharton property,--when his position in\r\nthe country would really be, as he frequently told himself, quite\r\nconsiderable. Was it possible that he should refrain from blaming\r\nhis father for not allowing him to obtain, early in life, that\r\nparliamentary education which would fit him to be an ornament to the\r\nHouse of Commons, and a safeguard to his country in future years?\r\n\r\nNow he and Lopez were at the Progress together, and they were almost\r\nthe only men in the club. Lopez was quite contented with his own\r\npresent sojourn in London. He had not only been at Gatherum Castle\r\nbut was going there again. And then he had brilliant hopes before\r\nhim,--so brilliant that they began, he thought, to assume the shape\r\nof certainties. He had corresponded with the Duchess, and he had\r\ngathered from her somewhat dubious words that the Duke would probably\r\naccede to her wishes in the matter of Silverbridge. The vacancy had\r\nnot yet been declared. Mr. Grey was deterred, no doubt by certain\r\nhigh State purposes, from applying for the stewardship of the\r\nChiltern Hundreds, and thereby releasing himself from his seat in\r\nParliament, and enabling himself to perform, with a clear conscience,\r\nduties in a distant part of the world which he did not feel to be\r\ncompatible with that seat. The seekers after seats were, no doubt,\r\nalready on the track; but the Duchess had thought that as far as the\r\nDuke\'s good word went, it might possibly be given in favour of Mr.\r\nLopez. The happy aspirant had taken this to be almost as good as a\r\npromise. There were also certain pecuniary speculations on foot,\r\nwhich could not be kept quite quiet even in September, as to which he\r\ndid not like to trust entirely to the unaided energy of Mr. Sextus\r\nParker, or to the boasted alliance of Mr. Mills Happerton. Sextus\r\nParker\'s whole heart and soul were now in the matter, but Mr. Mills\r\nHapperton, an undoubted partner in Hunky and Sons, had blown a little\r\ncoldly on the affair. But in spite of this Ferdinand Lopez was happy.\r\nWas it probable that Mr. Wharton should continue his opposition to\r\na marriage which would make his daughter the wife of a member of\r\nParliament and of a special friend of the Duchess of Omnium?\r\n\r\nHe had said a word about his own prospects in reference to the\r\nmarriage, but Everett had been at first too full of his own affairs\r\nto attend much to a matter which was comparatively so trifling. "Upon\r\nmy word," he said, "I am beginning to feel angry with the governor,\r\nwhich is a kind of thing I don\'t like at all."\r\n\r\n"I can understand that when he\'s angry with you, you shouldn\'t like\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind that half so much. He\'ll come round. However unjust he\r\nmay be now, at the moment, he\'s the last man in the world to do an\r\ninjustice in his will. I have thorough confidence in him. But I find\r\nmyself driven into hostility to him by a conviction that he won\'t let\r\nme take any real step in life, till my life has been half frittered\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"You\'re thinking of Parliament."\r\n\r\n"Of course I am. I don\'t say you ain\'t an Englishman, but you are not\r\nquite enough of an Englishman to understand what Parliament is to\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"I hope to be,--some of these days," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you may. I won\'t say but what you may get yourself educated\r\nto it when you\'ve been married a dozen years to an English wife, and\r\nhave half-a-dozen English children of your own. But, in the meantime,\r\nlook at my position. I am twenty-eight years old."\r\n\r\n"I am four years your senior."\r\n\r\n"It does not matter a straw to you," continued Everett. "But a few\r\nyears are everything with me. I have a right to suppose that I may be\r\nable to represent the county,--say in twenty years. I shall probably\r\nthen be the head of the family and a rich man. Consider what a\r\nparliamentary education would be to me! And then it is just the life\r\nfor which I have laid myself out, and in which I could make myself\r\nuseful. You don\'t sympathise with me, but you might understand me."\r\n\r\n"I do both. I think of going into the House myself."\r\n\r\n"You!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I do."\r\n\r\n"You must have changed your ideas very much then within the last\r\nmonth or two."\r\n\r\n"I have changed my ideas. My one chief object in life is, as you\r\nknow, to marry your sister; and if I were a Member of Parliament I\r\nthink that some difficulties would be cleared away."\r\n\r\n"But there won\'t be an election for the next three years at any\r\nrate," said Everett Wharton, staring at his friend. "You don\'t mean\r\nto keep Emily waiting for a dissolution?"\r\n\r\n"There are occasional vacancies," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Is there a chance of anything of that kind falling in your way?"\r\n\r\n"I think there is. I can\'t quite tell you all the particulars because\r\nother people are concerned, but I don\'t think it improbable that I\r\nmay be in the House before--; well, say in three months\' time."\r\n\r\n"In three months\' time!" exclaimed Everett, whose mouth was watering\r\nat the prospects of his friend. "That is what comes from going\r\nto stay with the Prime Minister, I suppose." Lopez shrugged his\r\nshoulders. "Upon my word I can\'t understand you," continued the\r\nother. "It was only the other day you were arguing in this very room\r\nas to the absurdity of a parliamentary career,--pitching into me, by\r\nGeorge, like the very mischief, because I had said something in its\r\nfavour,--and now you are going in for it yourself in some sort of\r\nmysterious way that a fellow can\'t understand." It was quite clear\r\nthat Everett Wharton thought himself ill-used by his friend\'s\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n"There is no mystery;--only I can\'t tell people\'s names."\r\n\r\n"What is the borough?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you that at present."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure there will be a vacancy?"\r\n\r\n"I think I am sure."\r\n\r\n"And that you will be invited to stand?"\r\n\r\n"I am not sure of that."\r\n\r\n"Of course anybody can stand whether invited or not."\r\n\r\n"If I come forward for this place I shall do so on the very best\r\ninterest. Don\'t mention it. I tell you because I already regard my\r\nconnection with you as being so close as to call upon me to tell you\r\nanything of that kind."\r\n\r\n"And yet you do not tell me the details."\r\n\r\n"I tell you all that I can in honour tell."\r\n\r\nEverett Wharton certainly felt aggrieved by his friend\'s news, and\r\nplainly showed that he did so. It was so hard that if a stray seat\r\nin Parliament were going a-begging, it should be thrown in the way\r\nof this man who didn\'t care for it, and couldn\'t use it to any good\r\npurpose, instead of in his own way! Why should any one want Ferdinand\r\nLopez to be in Parliament? Ferdinand Lopez had paid no attention to\r\nthe great political questions of the Commonwealth. He knew nothing of\r\nLabour and Capital, of Unions, Strikes, and Lock-outs. But because he\r\nwas rich, and, by being rich, had made his way among great people,\r\nhe was to have a seat in Parliament! As for the wealth, it might be\r\nat his own command also,--if only his father could be got to see\r\nthe matter in a proper light. And as for the friendship of great\r\npeople,--Prime Ministers, Duchesses, and such like,--Everett Wharton\r\nwas quite confident that he was at any rate as well qualified to\r\nshine among them as Ferdinand Lopez. He was of too good a nature to\r\nbe stirred to injustice against his friend by the soreness of this\r\nfeeling. He did not wish to rob his friend of his wealth, of his\r\nDuchesses, or of his embryo seat in Parliament. But for the moment\r\nthere came upon him a doubt whether Ferdinand was so very clever, or\r\nso peculiarly gentlemanlike or in any way very remarkable, and almost\r\na conviction that he was very far from being good-looking.\r\n\r\nThey dined together, and quite late in the evening they strolled out\r\ninto St. James\'s Park. There was nobody in London, and there was\r\nnothing for either of them to do, and therefore they agreed to walk\r\nround the park, dark and gloomy as they knew the park would be. Lopez\r\nhad seen and had quite understood the bitterness of spirit by which\r\nEverett had been oppressed, and with that peculiarly imperturbable\r\ngood humour which made a part of his character bore it all, even with\r\ntenderness. He was a man, as are many of his race, who could bear\r\ncontradictions, unjust suspicions, and social ill-treatment without\r\na shadow of resentment, but who, if he had a purpose, could carry\r\nit out without a shadow of a scruple. Everett Wharton had on this\r\noccasion made himself very unpleasant, and Lopez had borne with him\r\nas an angel would hardly have done; but should Wharton ever stand in\r\nhis friend\'s way, his friend would sacrifice him without compunction.\r\nAs it was, Lopez bore with him, simply noting in his own mind that\r\nEverett Wharton was a greater ass than he had taken him to be. It was\r\nWharton\'s idea that they should walk round the park, and Lopez for a\r\ntime had discouraged the suggestion. "It is a wretchedly dark place\r\nat night, and you don\'t know whom you may meet there."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that you are afraid to walk round St. James\'s\r\nPark with me, because it\'s dark!" said Wharton.\r\n\r\n"I certainly should be afraid by myself, but I don\'t know that I am\r\nafraid with you. But what\'s the good?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s better than sitting here doing nothing, without a soul to speak\r\nto. I\'ve already smoked half-a-dozen cigars, till I\'m so muddled I\r\ndon\'t know what I\'m about. It\'s so hot one can\'t walk in the day, and\r\nthis is just the time for exercise." Lopez yielded, being willing to\r\nyield in almost anything at present to the brother of Emily Wharton;\r\nand, though the thing seemed to him to be very foolish, they entered\r\nthe park by St. James\'s Palace, and started to walk round it, turning\r\nto the right and going in front of Buckingham Palace. As they went on\r\nWharton still continued his accusation against his father and said\r\nalso some sharp things against Lopez himself, till his companion\r\nbegan to think that the wine he had drunk had been as bad as the\r\ncigars. "I can\'t understand your wanting to go into Parliament," he\r\nsaid. "What do you know about it?"\r\n\r\n"If I get there, I can learn like anybody else, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Half of those who go there don\'t learn. They are, as it were, born\r\nto it, and they do very well to support this party or that."\r\n\r\n"And why shouldn\'t I support this party,--or that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose you know which party you would support,--except that\r\nyou\'d vote for the Duke, if, as I suppose, you are to get in under\r\nthe Duke\'s influence. If I went into the House I should go with a\r\nfixed and settled purpose of my own."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not there yet," said Lopez, willing to drop the subject.\r\n\r\n"It will be a great expense to you, and will stand altogether in the\r\nway of your profession. As far as Emily is concerned, I should think\r\nmy father would be dead against it."\r\n\r\n"Then he would be unreasonable."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, if he thought you would injure your professional\r\nprospects. It is a d---- piece of folly; that\'s the long and the\r\nshort of it."\r\n\r\nThis certainly was very uncivil, and it almost made Lopez angry. But\r\nhe had made up his mind that his friend was a little the worse for\r\nthe wine he had drunk, and therefore he did not resent even this.\r\n"Never mind politics and Parliament now," he said, "but let us get\r\nhome. I am beginning to be sick of this. It\'s so awfully dark, and\r\nwhenever I do hear a step, I think somebody is coming to rob us. Let\r\nus get on a bit."\r\n\r\n"What the deuce are you afraid of?" said Everett. They had then come\r\nup the greater part of the length of the Birdcage Walk, and the\r\nlights at Storey\'s Gate were just visible, but the road on which they\r\nwere then walking was very dark. The trees were black over their\r\nhead, and not a step was heard near them. At this time it was just\r\nmidnight. Now, certainly, among the faults which might be justly\r\nattributed to Lopez, personal cowardice could not be reckoned. On\r\nthis evening he had twice spoken of being afraid, but the fear had\r\nsimply been that which ordinary caution indicates; and his object had\r\nbeen that of hindering Wharton in the first place from coming into\r\nthe park, and then of getting him out of it as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n"Come along," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"By George, you are in a blue funk," said the other. "I can hear your\r\nteeth chattering." Lopez, who was beginning to be angry, walked on\r\nand said nothing. It was too absurd, he thought, for real anger, but\r\nhe kept a little in front of Wharton, intending to show that he was\r\ndispleased. "You had better run away at once," said Wharton.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I shall begin to think that you\'re tipsy," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Tipsy!" said the other. "How dare you say such a thing to me? You\r\nnever in your life saw me in the least altered by any thing I had\r\ndrunk."\r\n\r\nLopez knew that at any rate this was untrue. "I\'ve seen you as drunk\r\nas Cloe before now," said he.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a lie," said Everett Wharton.\r\n\r\n"Come, Wharton," said the other, "do not disgrace yourself by conduct\r\nsuch as that. Something has put you out, and you do not know what you\r\nare saying. I can hardly imagine that you should wish to insult me."\r\n\r\n"It was you who insulted me. You said I was drunk. When you said it\r\nyou knew it was untrue."\r\n\r\nLopez walked on a little way in silence, thinking over this most\r\nabsurd quarrel. Then he turned round and spoke. "This is all the\r\ngreatest nonsense I ever heard in the world. I\'ll go on and go to\r\nbed, and to-morrow morning you\'ll think better of it. But pray\r\nremember that under no circumstances should you call a man a liar,\r\nunless on cool consideration you are determined to quarrel with him\r\nfor lying, and determined also to see the quarrel out."\r\n\r\n"I am quite ready to see this quarrel out."\r\n\r\n"Good night," said Lopez, starting off at a quick pace. They were\r\nthen close to the turn in the park, and Lopez went on till he had\r\nnearly reached the park front of the new offices. As he had walked\r\nhe had listened to the footfall of his friend, and after a while\r\nhad perceived, or had thought that he had perceived, that the sound\r\nwas discontinued. It seemed to him that Wharton had altogether lost\r\nhis senses;--the insult to himself had been so determined and so\r\nabsolutely groundless! He had striven his best to conquer the man\'s\r\nill-humour by good-natured forbearance, and had only suggested that\r\nWharton was perhaps tipsy in order to give him some excuse. But if\r\nhis companion were really drunk, as he now began to think, could it\r\nbe right to leave him unprotected in the park? The man\'s manner had\r\nbeen strange the whole evening, but there had been no sign of the\r\neffect of wine till after they had left the club. But Lopez had heard\r\nof men who had been apparently sober, becoming drunk as soon as they\r\ngot out into the air. It might have been so in this case, though\r\nWharton\'s voice and gait had not been those of a drunken man. At any\r\nrate, he would turn back and look after him; and as he did turn back,\r\nhe resolved that whatever Wharton might say to him on this night he\r\nwould not notice. He was too wise to raise a further impediment to\r\nhis marriage by quarrelling with Emily\'s brother.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he paused he was sure that he heard footsteps behind him\r\nwhich were not those of Everett Wharton. Indeed, he was sure that he\r\nheard the footsteps of more than one person. He stood still for a\r\nmoment to listen, and then he distinctly heard a rush and a scuffle.\r\nHe ran back to the spot at which he had left his friend, and at first\r\nthought that he perceived a mob of people in the dusk. But as he got\r\nnearer, he saw that there were a man and two women. Wharton was on\r\nthe ground, on his back, and the man was apparently kneeling on his\r\nneck and head while the women were rifling his pockets. Lopez, hardly\r\nknowing how he was acting, was upon them in a moment, flying in the\r\nfirst place at the man, who had jumped up to meet him as he came. He\r\nreceived at once a heavy blow on his head from some weapon, which,\r\nhowever, his hat so far stopped as to save him from being felled or\r\nstunned, and then he felt another blow from behind on the ear, which\r\nhe afterwards conceived to have been given him by one of the women.\r\nBut before he could well look about him, or well know how the whole\r\nthing had happened, the man and the two women had taken to their\r\nlegs, and Wharton was standing on his feet leaning against the iron\r\nrailings.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing had occupied a very short space of time, and yet\r\nthe effects were very grave. At the first moment Lopez looked round\r\nand endeavoured to listen, hoping that some assistance might be\r\nnear,--some policeman, or, if not that, some wanderer by night who\r\nmight be honest enough to help him. But he could hear or see no one,\r\nIn this condition of things it was not possible for him to pursue the\r\nruffians, as he could not leave his friend leaning against the park\r\nrails. It was at once manifest to him that Wharton had been much\r\nhurt, or at any rate incapacitated for immediate exertion, by the\r\nblows he had received;--and as he put his hand up to his own head,\r\nfrom which in the scuffle his hat had fallen, he was not certain that\r\nhe was not severely hurt himself. Lopez could see that Wharton was\r\nvery pale, that his cravat had been almost wrenched from his neck by\r\npressure, that his waistcoat was torn open and the front of his shirt\r\nsoiled,--and he could see also that a fragment of the watch-chain was\r\nhanging loose, showing that the watch was gone. "Are you hurt much?"\r\nhe said, coming close up and taking a tender hold of his friend\'s\r\narm. Wharton smiled and shook his head, but spoke not a word. He was\r\nin truth more shaken, stunned, and bewildered than actually injured.\r\nThe ruffian\'s fist had been at his throat, twisting his cravat, and\r\nfor half a minute he had felt that he was choked. As he had struggled\r\nwhile one woman pulled at his watch and the other searched for his\r\npurse,--struggling, alas! unsuccessfully,--the man had endeavoured\r\nto quiet him by kneeling on his chest, strangling him with his own\r\nnecktie, and pressing hard on his gullet. It is a treatment which,\r\nafter a few seconds of vigorous practice, is apt to leave the patient\r\nfor a while disconcerted and unwilling to speak. "Say a word if you\r\ncan," whispered Lopez, looking into the other man\'s face with anxious\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAt the moment there came across Wharton\'s mind a remembrance that\r\nhe had behaved very badly to his friend, and some sort of vague\r\nmisty doubt whether all this evil had not befallen him because of\r\nhis misconduct. But he knew at the same time that Lopez was not\r\nresponsible for the evil, and dismayed as he had been, still he\r\nrecalled enough of the nature of the struggle in which he had been\r\nengaged, to be aware that Lopez had befriended him gallantly. He\r\ncould not even yet speak; but he saw the blood trickling down his\r\nfriend\'s temple and forehead, and lifting up his hand, touched the\r\nspot with his fingers. Lopez also put his hand up, and drew it away\r\ncovered with blood. "Oh," said he, "that does not signify in the\r\nleast. I got a knock, I know, and I am afraid I have lost my hat, but\r\nI\'m not hurt."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" The word was uttered with a low sigh. Then there was a\r\npause, during which Lopez supported the sufferer. "I thought that it\r\nwas all over with me at one moment."\r\n\r\n"You will be better now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. My watch is gone!"\r\n\r\n"I fear it is," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"And my purse," said Wharton, collecting his strength together\r\nsufficiently to search for his treasures. "I had eight L5 notes in\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Never mind your money or your watch if your bones are not broken."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a bore all the same to lose every shilling that one has." Then\r\nthey walked very slowly away towards the steps at the Duke of York\'s\r\ncolumn, Wharton regaining his strength as he went, but still able\r\nto progress but leisurely. Lopez had not found his hat, and, being\r\ncovered with blood, was, as far as appearances went, in a worse\r\nplight than the other. At the foot of the steps they met a policeman,\r\nto whom they told their story, and who, as a matter of course,\r\nwas filled with an immediate desire to arrest them both. To the\r\npoliceman\'s mind it was most distressing that a bloody-faced man\r\nwithout a hat, with a companion almost too weak to walk, should not\r\nbe conveyed to a police-station. But after ten minutes\' parley,\r\nduring which Wharton sat on the bottom step and Lopez explained all\r\nthe circumstances, he consented to get them a cab, to take their\r\naddress, and then to go alone to the station and make his report.\r\nThat the thieves had got off with their plunder was only too\r\nmanifest. Lopez took the injured man home to the house in Manchester\r\nSquare, and then returned in the same cab, hatless, to his own\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\nAs he returned he applied his mind to think how he could turn the\r\nevents of the evening to his own use. He did not believe that Everett\r\nWharton was severely hurt. Indeed there might be a question whether\r\nin the morning his own injury would not be the most severe. But the\r\nimmediate effect on the flustered and despoiled unfortunate one had\r\nbeen great enough to justify Lopez in taking strong steps if strong\r\nsteps could in any way benefit himself. Would it be best to publish\r\nthis affair on the house-tops, or to bury it in the shade, as nearly\r\nas it might be buried? He had determined in his own mind that his\r\nfriend certainly had been tipsy. In no other way could his conduct\r\nbe understood. And a row with a tipsy man at midnight in the park\r\nis not, at first sight, creditable. But it could be made to have\r\na better appearance if told by himself, than if published from\r\nother quarters. The old housekeeper at Manchester Square must know\r\nsomething about it, and would, of course, tell what she knew, and\r\nthe loss of the money and the watch must in all probability be made\r\nknown. Before he had reached his own door he had quite made up his\r\nmind that he himself would tell the story after his own fashion.\r\n\r\nAnd he told it, before he went to bed that night. He washed the blood\r\nfrom his face and head, and cut away a part of the clotted hair, and\r\nthen wrote a letter to old Mr. Wharton at Wharton Hall. And between\r\nthree and four o\'clock in the morning he went out and posted his\r\nletter in the nearest pillar, so that it might go down by the day\r\nmail and certainly be preceded by no other written tidings. The\r\nletter which he sent was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MR. WHARTON,\r\n\r\n   I regret to have to send you an account of a rather\r\n   serious accident which has happened to Everett. I am now\r\n   writing at 3 A.M., having just taken him home, and it\r\n   occurred at about midnight. You may be quite sure that\r\n   there is no danger or I should have advertised you by\r\n   telegram.\r\n\r\n   There is nothing doing in town, and therefore, as the\r\n   night was fine, we, very foolishly, agreed to walk round\r\n   St. James\'s Park late after dinner. It is a kind of thing\r\n   that nobody does;--but we did it. When we had nearly got\r\n   round I was in a hurry, whereas Everett was for strolling\r\n   slowly, and so I went on before him. But I was hardly two\r\n   hundred yards in front of him before he was attacked by\r\n   three persons, a man and two women. The man I presume\r\n   came upon him from behind, but he has not sufficiently\r\n   collected his thoughts to remember exactly what occurred.\r\n   I heard the scuffle and of course turned back,--and was\r\n   luckily in time to get up before he was seriously hurt.\r\n   I think the man would otherwise have strangled him. I am\r\n   sorry to say that he lost both his watch and purse.\r\n\r\n   He undoubtedly has been very much shaken, and altogether\r\n   "knocked out of time," as people say. Excuse the phrase,\r\n   because I think it will best explain what I want you to\r\n   understand. The man\'s hand at his throat must have stopped\r\n   his breathing for some seconds. He certainly has received\r\n   no permanent injury, but I should not wonder if he should\r\n   be unwell for some days. I tell you all exactly as it\r\n   occurred, as it strikes me that you may like to run up to\r\n   town for a day just to look at him. But you need not do so\r\n   on the score of any danger. Of course he will see a doctor\r\n   to-morrow. There did not seem to be any necessity for\r\n   calling one up to-night. We did give notice to the police\r\n   as we were coming home, but I fear the ruffians had ample\r\n   time for escape. He was too weak, and I was too fully\r\n   employed with him, to think of pursuing them at the time.\r\n\r\n   Of course he is at Manchester Square.\r\n\r\n   Most faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n   FERDINAND LOPEZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did not say a word about Emily, but he knew that Emily would\r\nsee the letter and would perceive that he had been the means of\r\npreserving her brother; and, in regard to the old barrister himself,\r\nLopez thought that the old man could not but feel grateful for\r\nhis conduct. He had in truth behaved very well to Everett. He had\r\nreceived a heavy blow on the head in young Wharton\'s defence,--of\r\nwhich he was determined to make good use, though he had thought it\r\nexpedient to say nothing about the blow in his letter. Surely it\r\nwould all help. Surely the paternal mind would be softened towards\r\nhim when the father should be made to understand how great had been\r\nhis service to the son. That Everett would make little of what had\r\nbeen done for him he did not in the least fear. Everett Wharton was\r\nsometimes silly but was never ungenerous.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his night\'s work Lopez was in Manchester Square before\r\nnine on the following morning, and on the side of his brow he bore\r\na great patch of black plaster. "My head is very thick," he said\r\nlaughing, when Everett asked after his wound. "But it would have gone\r\nbadly with me if the ruffian had struck an inch lower. I suppose my\r\nhat saved me, though I remember very little. Yes, old fellow, I have\r\nwritten to your father, and I think he will come up. It was better\r\nthat it should be so."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing the matter with me," said Everett.\r\n\r\n"One didn\'t quite know last night whether there was or no. At any\r\nrate his coming won\'t hurt you. It\'s always well to have your banker\r\nnear you, when your funds are low."\r\n\r\nThen after a pause Everett made his apology,--"I know I made a great\r\nass of myself last night."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think about it."\r\n\r\n"I used a word I shouldn\'t have used, and I beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"Not another word, Everett. Between you and me things can\'t go wrong.\r\nWe love each other too well."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSurrender\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter given in the previous chapter was received at Wharton\r\nHall late in the evening of the day on which it was written, and was\r\ndiscussed among all the Whartons that night. Of course there was no\r\ndoubt as to the father\'s going up to town on the morrow. The letter\r\nwas just such a letter as would surely make a man run to his son\'s\r\nbedside. Had the son written himself it would have been different;\r\nbut the fact that the letter had come from another man seemed to be\r\nevidence that the poor sufferer could not write. Perhaps the urgency\r\nwith which Lopez had sent off his dispatch, getting his account of\r\nthe fray ready for the very early day mail, though the fray had not\r\ntaken place till midnight, did not impress them sufficiently when\r\nthey accepted this as evidence of Everett\'s dangerous condition. At\r\nthis conference at Wharton very little was said about Lopez, but\r\nthere was a general feeling that he had behaved well. "It was very\r\nodd that they should have parted in the park," said Sir Alured.\r\n"But very lucky that they should not have parted sooner," said John\r\nFletcher. If a grain of suspicion against Lopez might have been set\r\nafloat in their minds by Sir Alured\'s suggestion, it was altogether\r\ndissipated by John Fletcher\'s reply;--for everybody there knew that\r\nJohn Fletcher carried common sense for the two families. Of course\r\nthey all hated Ferdinand Lopez, but nothing could be extracted from\r\nthe incident, as far as its details were yet known to them, which\r\ncould be turned to his injury.\r\n\r\nWhile they sat together discussing the matter in the drawing-room\r\nEmily Wharton hardly said a word. She uttered a little shriek when\r\nthe account of the affair was first read to her, and then listened\r\nwith silent attention to what was said around her. When there had\r\nseemed for a moment to be a doubt,--or rather a question, for there\r\nhad been no doubt,--whether her father should go at once to London,\r\nshe had spoken just a word. "Of course you will go, papa." After\r\nthat, she said nothing till she came to him in his own room. "Of\r\ncourse I will go with you to-morrow, papa."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that will be necessary."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Think how wretched I should be."\r\n\r\n"I would telegraph to you immediately."\r\n\r\n"And I shouldn\'t believe the telegraph. Don\'t you know how it always\r\nis? Besides we have been more than the usual time. We were to go to\r\ntown in ten days, and you would not think of returning to fetch me.\r\nOf course I will go with you. I have already begun to pack my things,\r\nand Jane is now at it." Her father, not knowing how to oppose her,\r\nyielded, and Emily before she went to bed had made the ladies of the\r\nhouse aware that she also intended to start the next morning at eight\r\no\'clock.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the journey very little was said between Mr.\r\nWharton and Emily. There were other persons in the carriage, and she,\r\nthough she had determined in some vague way that she would speak some\r\nwords to her father before she reached their own house, had still\r\nwanted time to resolve what those words should be. But before she\r\nhad reached Gloucester she had made up her mind, and going on from\r\nGloucester she found herself for a time alone with her father. She\r\nwas sitting opposite to him, and after conversing for a while she\r\ntouched his knee with her hand. "Papa," she said, "I suppose I must\r\nnow have to meet Mr. Lopez in Manchester Square?"\r\n\r\n"Why should you have to meet Mr. Lopez in Manchester Square?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he will come there to see Everett. After what has occurred\r\nyou can hardly forbid him the house. He has saved Everett\'s life."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he has done anything of the kind," said Mr.\r\nWharton, who was vacillating between different opinions. He did in\r\nhis heart believe that the Portuguese whom he so hated had saved his\r\nson from the thieves, and he also had almost come to the conviction\r\nthat he must give his daughter to the man,--but at the same time he\r\ncould not as yet bring himself to abandon his opposition to the\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you think the story is not true."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt the story in the least. Of course one man sticks to\r\nanother in such an affair, and I have no doubt that Mr. Lopez behaved\r\nas any English gentleman would."\r\n\r\n"Any English gentleman, papa, would have to come afterwards and see\r\nthe friend he had saved. Don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--he might call."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Lopez will have an additional reason for calling,--and I\r\nknow he will come. Don\'t you think he will come?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to think anything about it," said the father.\r\n\r\n"But I want you to think about it, papa. Papa, I know you are not\r\nindifferent to my happiness."\r\n\r\n"I hope you know it."\r\n\r\n"I do know it. I am quite sure of it. And therefore I don\'t think you\r\nought to be afraid to talk to me about what must concern my happiness\r\nso greatly. As far as my own self and my own will are concerned I\r\nconsider myself given away to Mr. Lopez already. Nothing but his\r\nmarrying some other woman,--or his death,--would make me think of\r\nmyself otherwise than as belonging to him. I am not a bit ashamed of\r\nowning my love--to you; nor to him, if the opportunity were allowed\r\nme. I don\'t think there should be concealment about anything so\r\nimportant between people who are dear to each other. I have told\r\nyou that I will do whatever you bid me about him. If you say that\r\nI shall not speak to him or see him, I will not speak to him or see\r\nhim--willingly. You certainly need not be afraid that I should marry\r\nhim without your leave."\r\n\r\n"I am not in the least afraid of it."\r\n\r\n"But I think you should think over what you are doing. And I am quite\r\nsure of this,--that you must tell me what I am to do in regard to\r\nreceiving Mr. Lopez in Manchester Square." Mr. Wharton listened\r\nattentively to what his daughter said to him, shaking his head from\r\ntime to time as though almost equally distracted by her passive\r\nobedience and by her passionate protestations of love; but he said\r\nnothing. When she had completed her supplication he threw himself\r\nback in his seat and after a while took his book. It may be doubted\r\nwhether he read much, for the question as to his girl\'s happiness was\r\nquite as near his heart as she could wish it to be.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon before they reached Manchester Square,\r\nand they were both happy to find that they were not troubled by Mr.\r\nLopez at the first moment. Everett was at home and in bed, and had\r\nnot indeed as yet recovered from the effect of the man\'s knuckles at\r\nhis windpipe; but he was well enough to assure his father and sister\r\nthat they need not have disturbed themselves or hurried their return\r\nfrom Herefordshire on his account. "To tell the truth," said he,\r\n"Ferdinand Lopez was hurt worse than I was."\r\n\r\n"He said nothing of being hurt himself," said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"How was he hurt?" asked Emily in the quietest, stillest voice.\r\n\r\n"The fact is," said Everett, beginning to tell the whole story after\r\nhis own fashion, "if he hadn\'t been at hand then, there would have\r\nbeen an end of me. We had separated, you know,--"\r\n\r\n"What could make two men separate from each other in the darkness of\r\nSt. James\'s Park?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--to tell the truth, we had quarrelled. I had made an ass\r\nof myself. You need not go into that any further, except that you\r\nshould know that it was all my fault. Of course it wasn\'t a real\r\nquarrel,"--when he said this Emily, who was sitting close to his\r\nbed-head, pressed his arm under the clothes with her hand,--"but I\r\nhad said something rough, and he had gone on just to put an end to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"It was uncommonly foolish," said old Wharton. "It was very foolish\r\ngoing round the park at all at that time of night."\r\n\r\n"No doubt, sir;--but it was my doing. And if he had not gone with me,\r\nI should have gone alone." Here there was another pressure. "I was a\r\nlittle low in spirits, and wanted the walk."\r\n\r\n"But how is he hurt?" asked the father.\r\n\r\n"The man who was kneeling on me and squeezing the life out of me\r\njumped up when he heard Lopez coming, and struck him over the head\r\nwith a bludgeon. I heard the blow, though I was pretty well done for\r\nat the time myself. I don\'t think they hit me, but they got something\r\nround my neck, and I was half strangled before I knew what they were\r\ndoing. Poor Lopez bled horribly, but he says he is none the worse for\r\nit." Here there was another little pressure under the bed-clothes;\r\nfor Emily felt that her brother was pleading for her in every word\r\nthat he said.\r\n\r\nAbout ten on the following morning Lopez came and asked for Mr.\r\nWharton. He was shown into the study, where he found the old man, and\r\nat once began to give his account of the whole concern in an easy,\r\nunconcerned manner. He had the large black patch on the side of his\r\nhead, which had been so put on as almost to become him. But it was so\r\nconspicuous as to force a question respecting it from Mr. Wharton. "I\r\nam afraid you got rather a sharp knock yourself, Mr. Lopez?"\r\n\r\n"I did get a knock, certainly;--but the odd part of it is that I knew\r\nnothing about it till I found the blood in my eyes after they had\r\ndecamped. But I lost my hat, and there is a rather long cut just\r\nabove the temple. It hasn\'t done me the slightest harm. The worst of\r\nit was that they got off with Everett\'s watch and money."\r\n\r\n"Had he much money?"\r\n\r\n"Forty pounds!" And Lopez shook his head, thereby signifying that\r\nforty pounds at the present moment was more than Everett Wharton\r\ncould afford to lose. Upon the whole he carried himself very well,\r\ningratiating himself with the father, raising no question about the\r\ndaughter, and saying as little as possible of himself. He asked\r\nwhether he could go up and see his friend, and of course was allowed\r\nto do so. A minute before he entered the room Emily left it. They did\r\nnot see each other. At any rate he did not see her. But there was a\r\nfeeling with both of them that the other was close,--and there was\r\nsomething present to them, almost amounting to conviction, that the\r\naccident of the park robbery would be good for them.\r\n\r\n"He certainly did save Everett\'s life," Emily said to her father the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\n"Whether he did or not, he did his best," said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"When one\'s dearest relation is concerned," said Emily, "and when\r\nhis life has been saved, one feels that one has to be grateful even\r\nif it has been an accident. I hope he knows, at any rate, that I am\r\ngrateful."\r\n\r\nThe old man had not been a week in London before he knew that he had\r\nabsolutely lost the game. Mrs. Roby came back to her house round the\r\ncorner, ostensibly with the object of assisting her relatives in\r\nnursing Everett,--a purpose for which she certainly was not needed;\r\nbut, as the matter progressed, Mr. Wharton was not without suspicion\r\nthat her return had been arranged by Ferdinand Lopez. She took upon\r\nherself, at any rate, to be loud in the praise of the man who had\r\nsaved the life of her "darling nephew,"--and to see that others also\r\nshould be loud in his praise. In a little time all London had heard\r\nof the affair, and it had been discussed out of London. Down at\r\nGatherum Castle the matter had been known, or partly known,--but the\r\ntelling of it had always been to the great honour and glory of the\r\nhero. Major Pountney had almost broken his heart over it, and Captain\r\nGunner, writing to his friend from the Curragh, had asserted his\r\nknowledge that it was all a "got-up thing" between the two men. The\r\n"Breakfast Table" and the "Evening Pulpit" had been loud in praise of\r\nLopez; but the "People\'s Banner," under the management of Mr. Quintus\r\nSlide, had naturally thrown much suspicion on the incident when it\r\nbecame known to the Editor that Ferdinand Lopez had been entertained\r\nby the Duke and Duchess of Omnium. "We have always felt some slight\r\ndoubts as to the details of the affair said to have happened about a\r\nfortnight ago, just at midnight, in St. James\'s Park. We should be\r\nglad to know whether the policemen have succeeded in tracing any of\r\nthe stolen property, or whether any real attempt to trace it has been\r\nmade." This was one of the paragraphs, and it was hinted still more\r\nplainly afterwards that Everett Wharton, being short of money, had\r\narranged the plan with the view of opening his father\'s purse. But\r\nthe general effect was certainly serviceable to Lopez. Emily Wharton\r\ndid believe him to be a hero. Everett was beyond measure grateful to\r\nhim,--not only for having saved him from the thieves, but also for\r\nhaving told nothing of his previous folly. Mrs. Roby always alluded\r\nto the matter as if, for all coming ages, every Wharton ought to\r\nacknowledge that gratitude to a Lopez was the very first duty of\r\nlife. The old man felt the absurdity of much of this, but still it\r\naffected him. When Lopez came he could not be rough to the man who\r\nhad done a service to his son. And then he found himself compelled\r\nto do something. He must either take his daughter away, or he must\r\nyield. But his power of taking his daughter away seemed to be less\r\nthan it had been. There was an air of quiet, unmerited suffering\r\nabout her, which quelled him. And so he yielded.\r\n\r\nIt was after this fashion. Whether affected by the violence of the\r\nattack made on him, or from other cause, Everett had been unwell\r\nafter the affair, and had kept his room for a fortnight. During this\r\ntime Lopez came to see him daily, and daily Emily Wharton had to take\r\nherself out of the man\'s way, and hide herself from the man\'s sight.\r\nThis she did with much tact and with lady-like quietness, but not\r\nwithout an air of martyrdom, which cut her father to the quick. "My\r\ndear," he said to her one evening, as she was preparing to leave the\r\ndrawing-room on hearing his knock, "stop and see him if you like it."\r\n\r\n"Papa!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to make you wretched. If I could have died first, and\r\ngot out of the way, perhaps it would have been better."\r\n\r\n"Papa, you will kill me if you speak in that way! If there is\r\nanything to say to him, do you say it." And then she escaped.\r\n\r\nWell! It was an added bitterness, but no doubt it was his duty. If he\r\ndid intend to consent to the marriage, it certainly was for him to\r\nsignify that consent to the man. It would not be sufficient that he\r\nshould get out of the way and leave his girl to act for herself as\r\nthough she had no friend in the world. The surrender which he had\r\nmade to his daughter had come from a sudden impulse at the moment,\r\nbut it could not now be withdrawn. So he stood out on the staircase,\r\nand when Lopez came up on his way to Everett\'s bedroom, he took\r\nhim by the arm and led him into the drawing-room. "Mr. Lopez," he\r\nsaid, "you know that I have not been willing to welcome you into\r\nmy house as a son-in-law. There are reasons on my mind,--perhaps\r\nprejudices,--which are strong against it. They are as strong now\r\nas ever. But she wishes it, and I have the utmost reliance on her\r\nconstancy."\r\n\r\n"So have I," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment, if you please, sir. In such a position a father\'s\r\nthought is only as to his daughter\'s happiness and prosperity. It is\r\nnot his own that he should consider. I hear you well spoken of in\r\nthe outer world, and I do not know that I have a right to demand\r\nof my daughter that she should tear you from her affections,\r\nbecause--because you are not just such as I would have her husband to\r\nbe. You have my permission to see her." Then, before Lopez could say\r\na word, he left the room, and took his hat and hurried away to his\r\nclub.\r\n\r\nAs he went he was aware that he had made no terms at all;--but then\r\nhe was inclined to think that no terms should be made. There seemed\r\nto be a general understanding that Lopez was doing well in the\r\nworld,--in a profession of the working of which Mr. Wharton\r\nhimself knew absolutely nothing. He had a large fortune at his\r\nown bestowal,--intended for his daughter,--which would have been\r\nforthcoming at the moment and paid down on the nail, had she\r\nmarried Arthur Fletcher. The very way in which the money should be\r\ninvested and tied up and made to be safe and comfortable to the\r\nFletcher-cum-Wharton interests generally, had been fully settled\r\namong them. But now this other man, this stranger, this Portuguese,\r\nhad entered in upon the inheritance. But the stranger, the\r\nPortuguese, must wait. Mr. Wharton knew himself to be an old man.\r\nShe was his child, and he would not wrong her. But she should have\r\nher money closely settled upon herself on his death,--and on her\r\nchildren, should she then have any. It should be done by his will. He\r\nwould say nothing about money to Lopez, and if Lopez should, as was\r\nprobable, ask after his daughter\'s fortune, he would answer to this\r\neffect. Thus he almost resolved that he would give his daughter to\r\nthe man without any inquiry as to the man\'s means. The thing had to\r\nbe done, and he would take no further trouble about it. The comfort\r\nof his life was gone. His home would no longer be a home to him. His\r\ndaughter could not now be his companion. The sooner that death came\r\nto him the better, but till death should come he must console himself\r\nas well as he could by playing whist at the Eldon. It was after this\r\nfashion that Mr. Wharton thought of the coming marriage between his\r\ndaughter and her lover.\r\n\r\n"I have your father\'s consent to marry your sister," said Ferdinand\r\nimmediately on entering Everett\'s room.\r\n\r\n"I knew it must come soon," said the invalid.\r\n\r\n"I cannot say that it has been given in the most gracious\r\nmanner,--but it has been given very clearly. I have his express\r\npermission to see her. Those were his last words."\r\n\r\nThen there was a sending of notes between the sick-room and the sick\r\nman\'s sister\'s room. Everett wrote and Ferdinand wrote, and Emily\r\nwrote,--short lines each of them,--a few words scrawled. The last\r\nfrom Emily was as follows:--"Let him go into the drawing-room. E. W."\r\nAnd so Ferdinand went down, to meet his love,--to encounter her for\r\nthe first time as her recognised future husband and engaged lover.\r\nPassionate, declared, and thorough as was her love for this man, the\r\nfamiliar intercourse between them had hitherto been very limited.\r\nThere had been little,--we may perhaps say none,--of that dalliance\r\nbetween them which is so delightful to the man and so wondrous to the\r\ngirl till custom has staled the edge of it. He had never sat with his\r\narm round her waist. He had rarely held even her hand in his for a\r\nhappy recognised pause of a few seconds. He had never kissed even\r\nher brow. And there she was now, standing before him, all his own,\r\nabsolutely given to him, with the fullest assurance of love on her\r\npart, and with the declared consent of her father. Even he had been\r\na little confused as he opened the door,--even he, as he paused to\r\nclose it behind him, had had to think how he would address her, and\r\nperhaps had thought in vain. But he had not a moment for any thought\r\nafter entering the room. Whether it was his doing or hers he hardly\r\nknew; but she was in his arms, and her lips were pressed to his, and\r\nhis arm was tight round her waist, holding her close to his breast.\r\nIt seemed as though all that was wanting had been understood in a\r\nmoment, and as though they had lived together and loved for the last\r\ntwelve months with the fullest mutual confidence. And she was the\r\nfirst to speak:--\r\n\r\n"Ferdinand, I am so happy! Are you happy?"\r\n\r\n"My love; my darling!"\r\n\r\n"You have never doubted me, I know,--since you first knew it."\r\n\r\n"Doubted you, my girl!"\r\n\r\n"That I would be firm! And now papa has been good to me, and how\r\nquickly one\'s sorrow is over. I am yours, my love, for ever and ever.\r\nYou knew it before, but I like to tell you. I will be true to you in\r\neverything! Oh, my love!"\r\n\r\nHe had but little to say to her, but we know that for "lovers lacking\r\nmatter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss." In such moments silence\r\ncharms, and almost any words are unsuitable except those soft,\r\nbird-like murmurings of love which, sweet as they are to the ear, can\r\nhardly be so written as to be sweet to the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nThe Marriage\r\n\r\n\r\nThe engagement was made in October, and the marriage took place\r\nin the latter part of November. When Lopez pressed for an early\r\nday,--which he did very strongly,--Emily raised no difficulties in\r\nthe way of his wishes. The father, foolishly enough, would at first\r\nhave postponed it, and made himself so unpleasant to Lopez by his\r\nmanner of doing this, that the bride was driven to take her lover\'s\r\npart. As the thing was to be done, what was to be gained by delay?\r\nIt could not be made a joy to him; nor, looking at the matter as he\r\nlooked at it, could he make a joy even of her presence during the few\r\nintervening weeks. Lopez proposed to take his bride into Italy for\r\nthe winter months, and to stay there at any rate through December\r\nand January, alleging that he must be back in town by the beginning\r\nof February;--and this was taken as a fair plea for hastening the\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nWhen the matter was settled, he went back to Gatherum Castle, as he\r\nhad arranged to do with the Duchess, and managed to interest her\r\nGrace in all his proceedings. She promised that she would call on his\r\nbride in town, and even went so far as to send her a costly wedding\r\npresent. "You are sure she has got money?" said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"I am not sure of anything," said Lopez,--"except this, that I do\r\nnot mean to ask a single question about it. If he says nothing to\r\nme about money, I certainly shall say nothing to him. My feeling is\r\nthis, Duchess; I am not marrying Miss Wharton for her money. The\r\nmoney, if there be any, has had nothing to do with it. But of course\r\nit will be a pleasure added if it be there." The Duchess complimented\r\nhim, and told him that this was exactly as it should be.\r\n\r\nBut there was some delay as to the seat for Silverbridge. Mr. Grey\'s\r\ndeparture for Persia had been postponed,--the Duchess thought only\r\nfor a month or six weeks. The Duke, however, was of opinion that\r\nMr. Grey should not vacate his seat till the day of his going was\r\nat any rate fixed. The Duke, moreover, had not made any promise of\r\nsupporting his wife\'s favourite. "Don\'t set your heart upon it too\r\nmuch, Mr. Lopez," the Duchess had said; "but you may be sure I will\r\nnot forget you." Then it had been settled between them that the\r\nmarriage should not be postponed, or the proposed trip to Italy\r\nabandoned, because of the probable vacancy at Silverbridge. Should\r\nthe vacancy occur during his absence, and should the Duke consent,\r\nhe could return at once. All this occurred in the last week or two\r\nbefore his marriage.\r\n\r\nThere were various little incidents which did not tend to make the\r\nhappiness of Emily Wharton complete. She wrote to her cousin Mary\r\nWharton, and also to Lady Wharton;--and her father wrote to Sir\r\nAlured; but the folk at Wharton Hall did not give in their adherence.\r\nOld Mrs. Fletcher was still there, but John Fletcher had gone home to\r\nLongbarns. The obduracy of the Whartons might probably be owing to\r\nthese two accidents. Mrs. Fletcher declared aloud, as soon as the\r\ntidings reached her, that she never wished to see or hear anything\r\nmore of Emily Wharton. "She must be a girl," said Mrs. Fletcher,\r\n"of an ingrained vulgar taste." Sir Alured, whose letter from Mr.\r\nWharton had been very short, replied as shortly to his cousin. "Dear\r\nAbel,--We all hope that Emily will be happy, though of course we\r\nregret the marriage." The father, though he had not himself written\r\ntriumphantly, or even hopefully,--as fathers are wont to write when\r\ntheir daughters are given away in marriage,--was wounded by the\r\ncurtness and unkindness of the baronet\'s reply, and at the moment\r\ndeclared to himself that he would never go to Herefordshire any more.\r\nBut on the following day there came a worse blow than Sir Alured\'s\r\nsingle line. Emily, not in the least doubting but that her request\r\nwould be received with the usual ready assent, had asked Mary Wharton\r\nto be one of her bridesmaids. It must be supposed that the answer to\r\nthis was written, if not under the dictation, at any rate under the\r\ninspiration, of Mrs. Fletcher. It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR EMILY,\r\n\r\n   Of course we all wish you to be very happy in your\r\n   marriage, but equally of course we are all disappointed.\r\n   We had taught ourselves to think that you would have bound\r\n   yourself closer with us down here, instead of separating\r\n   yourself entirely from us.\r\n\r\n   Under all the circumstances mamma thinks it would not be\r\n   wise for me to go up to London as one of your bridesmaids.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate Cousin,\r\n\r\n   MARY WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter made poor Emily very angry for a day or two. "It is as\r\nunreasonable as it is ill-natured," she said to her brother.\r\n\r\n"What else could you expect from a stiff-necked, prejudiced set of\r\nprovincial ignoramuses?"\r\n\r\n"What Mary says is not true. She did not think that I was going to\r\nbind myself closer with them, as she calls it. I have been quite\r\nopen with her, and have always told her that I could not be Arthur\r\nFletcher\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"Why on earth should you marry to please them?"\r\n\r\n"Because they don\'t know Ferdinand they are determined to insult him.\r\nIt is an insult never to mention even his name. And to refuse to come\r\nto my marriage! The world is wide and there is room for us and them;\r\nbut it makes me unhappy,--very unhappy,--that I should have to break\r\nwith them." And then the tears came into her eyes. It was intended,\r\nno doubt, to be a complete breach, for not a single wedding present\r\nwas sent from Wharton Hall to the bride. But from Longbarns,--from\r\nJohn Fletcher himself,--there did come an elaborate coffee-pot,\r\nwhich, in spite of its inutility and ugliness, was very valuable to\r\nEmily.\r\n\r\nBut there was one other of her old Herefordshire friends who received\r\nthe tidings of her marriage without quarrelling with her. She herself\r\nhad written to her old lover.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR ARTHUR,\r\n\r\n   There has been so much true friendship and affection\r\n   between us that I do not like that you should hear\r\n   from any one but myself the news that I am going to be\r\n   married to Mr. Lopez. We are to be married on the 28th of\r\n   November,--this day month.\r\n\r\n   Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n   EMILY WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this she received a very short reply;--\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR EMILY,\r\n\r\n   I am as I always have been.\r\n\r\n   Yours,\r\n\r\n   A. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sent her no present, nor did he say a word to her beyond this;\r\nbut in her anger against the Herefordshire people she never included\r\nArthur Fletcher. She pored over the little note a score of times, and\r\nwept over it, and treasured it up among her inmost treasures, and\r\ntold herself that it was a thousand pities. She could talk, and did\r\ntalk, to Ferdinand about the Whartons, and about old Mrs. Fletcher,\r\nand described to him the arrogance and the stiffness and the\r\nignorance of the Herefordshire squirearchy generally; but she never\r\nspoke to him of Arthur Fletcher,--except in that one narrative of her\r\npast life, in which, girl-like, she told her lover of the one other\r\nlover who had loved her.\r\n\r\nBut these things of course gave a certain melancholy to the occasion\r\nwhich perhaps was increased by the season of the year,--by the\r\nNovember fogs, and by the emptiness and general sadness of the town.\r\nAnd added to this was the melancholy of old Mr. Wharton himself.\r\nAfter he had given his consent to the marriage he admitted a certain\r\namount of intimacy with his son-in-law, asking him to dinner, and\r\ndiscussing with him matters of general interest,--but never, in\r\ntruth, opening his heart to him. Indeed, how can any man open his\r\nheart to one whom he dislikes? At best he can only pretend to open\r\nhis heart, and even this Mr. Wharton would not do. And very soon\r\nafter the engagement Lopez left London and went to the Duke\'s place\r\nin the country. His objects in doing this and his aspirations in\r\nregard to a seat in Parliament were all made known to his future\r\nwife,--but he said not a word on the subject to her father; and she,\r\nacting under his instructions, was equally reticent. "He will get to\r\nknow me in time," he said to her, "and his manner will be softened\r\ntowards me. But till that time shall come, I can hardly expect him to\r\ntake a real interest in my welfare."\r\n\r\nWhen Lopez left London not a word had been said between him and his\r\nfather-in-law as to money. Mr. Wharton was content with such silence,\r\nnot wishing to make any promise as to immediate income from himself,\r\npretending to look at the matter as though he should say that, as his\r\ndaughter had made for herself her own bed, she must lie on it, such\r\nas it might be. And this silence certainly suited Ferdinand Lopez at\r\nthe time. To tell the truth of him,--though he was not absolutely\r\npenniless, he was altogether propertyless. He had been speculating\r\nin money without capital, and though he had now and again been\r\nsuccessful, he had also now and again failed. He had contrived\r\nthat his name should be mentioned here and there with the names\r\nof well-known wealthy commercial men, and had for the last twelve\r\nmonths made up a somewhat intimate alliance with that very sound\r\ncommercial man, Mr. Mills Happerton. But his dealings with Mr. Sextus\r\nParker were in truth much more confidential than those with Mr.\r\nMills Happerton, and at the present moment poor Sexty Parker was\r\nalternately between triumph and despair as things went this way or\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIt was not, therefore, surprising that Ferdinand Lopez should\r\nvolunteer no statements to the old lawyer about money, and that he\r\nshould make no inquiries. He was quite confident that Mr. Wharton had\r\nthe wealth which was supposed to belong to him, and was willing to\r\ntrust to his power of obtaining a fair portion of it as soon as he\r\nshould in truth be Mr. Wharton\'s son-in-law. Situated as he was, of\r\ncourse he must run some risk. And then, too, he had spoken of himself\r\nwith a grain of truth when he had told the Duchess that he was not\r\nmarrying for money. Ferdinand Lopez was not an honest man or a good\r\nman. He was a self-seeking, intriguing adventurer, who did not know\r\nhonesty from dishonesty when he saw them together. But he had at any\r\nrate this good about him, that he did love the girl whom he was about\r\nto marry. He was willing to cheat all the world,--so that he might\r\nsucceed, and make a fortune, and become a big and a rich man; but\r\nhe did not wish to cheat her. It was his ambition now to carry her\r\nup with him, and he thought how he might best teach her to assist\r\nhim in doing so,--how he might win her to help him in his cheating,\r\nespecially in regard to her own father. For to himself, to his own\r\nthinking, that which we call cheating was not dishonesty. To his\r\nthinking there was something bold, grand, picturesque, and almost\r\nbeautiful in the battle which such a one as himself must wage with\r\nthe world before he could make his way up in it. He would not pick\r\na pocket, or turn a false card, or, as he thought, forge a name.\r\nThat which he did, and desired to do, took with him the name of\r\nspeculation. When he persuaded poor Sexty Parker to hazard his all,\r\nknowing well that he induced the unfortunate man to believe what\r\nwas false, and to trust what was utterly untrustworthy, he did not\r\nhimself think that he was going beyond the lines of fair enterprise.\r\nNow, in his marriage, he had in truth joined himself to real wealth.\r\nCould he only command at once that which he thought ought to be his\r\nwife\'s share of the lawyer\'s money, he did not doubt but that he\r\ncould make a rapid fortune. It would not do for him to seem to be\r\ndesirous of the money a day before the time;--but, when the time\r\nshould come, would not his wife help him in his great career? But\r\nbefore she could do so she must be made to understand something of\r\nthe nature of that career, and of the need of such aid.\r\n\r\nOf course there arose the question where they should live. But he was\r\nready with an immediate answer to this question. He had been to look\r\nat a flat,--a set of rooms,--in the Belgrave Mansions, in Pimlico,\r\nor Belgravia you ought more probably to call it. He proposed to take\r\nthem furnished till they could look about at their leisure and get a\r\nhouse that should suit them. Would she like a flat? She would have\r\nliked a cellar with him, and so she told him. Then they went to look\r\nat the flat, and old Mr. Wharton condescended to go with them. Though\r\nhis heart was not in the business, still he thought that he was bound\r\nto look after his daughter\'s comfort. "They are very handsome rooms,"\r\nsaid Mr. Wharton, looking round upon the rather gorgeous furniture.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ferdinand, are they not too grand?" said Emily.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they are a little more than we quite want just at present,"\r\nhe said. "But I\'ll tell you, sir, just how it has happened. A man I\r\nknow wanted to let them for one year, just as they are, and offered\r\nthem to me for L450,--if I could pay the money in advance, at the\r\nmoment. And so I paid it."\r\n\r\n"You have taken them, then?" said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"Is it all settled?" said Emily, almost with disappointment.\r\n\r\n"I have paid the money, and I have so far taken them. But it is by\r\nno means settled. You have only to say you don\'t like them, and you\r\nshall never be asked to put your foot in them again."\r\n\r\n"But I do like them," she whispered to him.\r\n\r\n"The truth is, sir, that there is not the slightest difficulty in\r\nparting with them. So that when the chance came in my way I thought\r\nit best to secure the thing. It had all to be done, so to say, in an\r\nhour. My friend,--as far as he was a friend, for I don\'t know much\r\nabout him,--wanted the money and wanted to be off. So here they are,\r\nand Emily can do as she likes." Of course the rooms were regarded\r\nfrom that moment as the home for the next twelve months of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Ferdinand Lopez.\r\n\r\nAnd then they were married. The marriage was by no means a gay\r\naffair, the chief management of it falling into the hands of Mrs.\r\nDick Roby. Mrs. Dick indeed provided not only the breakfast,--or\r\nsaw rather that it was provided, for of course Mr. Wharton paid the\r\nbill,--but the four bridesmaids also, and all the company. They were\r\nmarried in the church in Vere Street, then went back to the house in\r\nManchester Square, and within a couple of hours were on their road to\r\nDover. Through it all not a word was said about money. At the last\r\nmoment,--when he was free from fear as to any questions about his own\r\naffairs,--Lopez had hoped that the old man would say something. "You\r\nwill find so many thousand pounds at your bankers\';"--or, "You may\r\nlook to me for so many hundreds a year." But there was not a word.\r\nThe girl had come to him without the assurance of a single shilling.\r\nIn his great endeavour to get her he had been successful. As he\r\nthought of this in the carriage, he pressed his arm close round her\r\nwaist. If the worst were to come to the worst, he would fight the\r\nworld for her. But if this old man should be stubborn, close-fisted,\r\nand absolutely resolved to bestow all his money upon his son because\r\nof this marriage,--ah!--how should he be able to bear such a wrong as\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nHalf-a-dozen times during that journey to Dover he resolved to think\r\nnothing further about it, at any rate for a fortnight; and yet,\r\nbefore he reached Dover, he had said a word to her. "I wonder what\r\nyour father means to do about money? He never told you?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"It is very odd that he should never have said anything."\r\n\r\n"Does it matter, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. But of course I have to talk about everything to\r\nyou;--and it is odd."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of the Honeymoon\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of his marriage, before he went to the altar, Lopez\r\nmade one or two resolutions as to his future conduct. The first was\r\nthat he would give himself a fortnight from his marriage day in which\r\nhe would not even think of money. He had made certain arrangements,\r\nin the course of which he had caused Sextus Parker to stare with\r\nsurprise and to sweat with dismay, but which nevertheless were\r\nsuccessfully concluded. Bills were drawn to run over to February,\r\nand ready money to a moderate extent was forthcoming, and fiscal\r\ntranquillity was insured for a certain short period. The confidence\r\nwhich Sextus Parker had once felt in his friend\'s own resources was\r\nsomewhat on the decline, but he still believed in his friend\'s skill\r\nand genius, and, after due inquiry, he believed entirely in his\r\nfriend\'s father-in-law. Sextus Parker still thought that things\r\nwould come round. Ferdinand,--he always now called his friend by his\r\nChristian name,--Ferdinand was beautifully, seraphically confident.\r\nAnd Sexty, who had been in a manner magnetised by Ferdinand, was\r\nconfident too--at certain periods of the day. He was very confident\r\nwhen he had had his two or three glasses of sherry at luncheon,\r\nand he was often delightfully confident with his cigar and\r\nbrandy-and-water at night. But there were periods in the morning in\r\nwhich he would shake with fear and sweat with dismay.\r\n\r\nBut Lopez himself, having with his friend\'s assistance arranged his\r\naffairs comfortably for a month or two, had, as a first resolution,\r\npromised himself a fortnight\'s freedom from all carking cares. His\r\nsecond resolution had been that at the end of the fortnight he would\r\ncommence his operations on Mr. Wharton. Up to the last moment he had\r\nhoped,--had almost expected,--that a sum of money would have been\r\npaid to him. Even a couple of thousand pounds for the time would have\r\nbeen of great use to him;--but no tender of any kind had been made.\r\nNot a word had been said. Things could not of course go on in that\r\nway. He was not going to play the coward with his father-in-law.\r\nThen he bethought himself how he would act if his father-in-law were\r\nsternly to refuse to do anything for him, and he assured himself that\r\nin such circumstances he would make himself very disagreeable to his\r\nfather-in-law. And then his third resolution had reference to his\r\nwife. She must be instructed in his ways. She must learn to look at\r\nthe world with his eyes. She must be taught the great importance\r\nof money,--not in a griping, hard-fisted, prosaic spirit; but that\r\nshe might participate in that feeling of his own which had in it so\r\nmuch that was grand, so much that was delightful, so much that was\r\npicturesque. He would never ask her to be parsimonious,--never even\r\nto be economical. He would take a glory in seeing her well dressed\r\nand well attended, with her own carriage and her own jewels. But she\r\nmust learn that the enjoyment of these things must be built upon\r\na conviction that the most important pursuit in the world was the\r\nacquiring of money. And she must be made to understand, first of all,\r\nthat she had a right to at any rate a half of her father\'s fortune.\r\nHe had perceived that she had much influence with her father, and she\r\nmust be taught to use this influence unscrupulously on her husband\'s\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that under the pressure of his thoughts he did\r\nbreak his first resolution within an hour or two of his marriage. It\r\nis easy for a man to say that he will banish care, so that he may\r\nenjoy to the full the delights of the moment. But this is a power\r\nwhich none but a savage possesses,--or perhaps an Irishman. We have\r\nlearned the lesson from the divines, the philosophers, and the poets.\r\nPost equitem sedet atra cura. Thus was Ferdinand Lopez mounted high\r\non his horse,--for he had triumphed greatly in his marriage, and\r\nreally felt that the world could give him no delight so great as to\r\nhave her beside him, and her as his own. But the inky devil sat close\r\nupon his shoulders. Where would he be at the end of three months if\r\nMr. Wharton would do nothing for him,--and if a certain venture in\r\nguano, to which he had tempted Sexty Parker, should not turn out the\r\nright way? He believed in the guano and he believed in Mr. Wharton,\r\nbut it is a terrible thing to have one\'s whole position in the world\r\nhanging upon either an unwilling father-in-law or a probable rise in\r\nthe value of manure! And then how would he reconcile himself to her\r\nif both father-in-law and guano should go against him, and how should\r\nhe endure her misery?\r\n\r\nThe inky devil had forced him to ask the question even before they\r\nhad reached Dover. "Does it matter?" she had asked. Then for the time\r\nhe had repudiated his solicitude, and had declared that no question\r\nof money was of much consequence to him,--thereby making his future\r\ntask with her so much the more difficult. After that he said nothing\r\nto her on the subject on that their wedding day,--but he could not\r\nprevent himself from thinking of it. Had he gone to the depth of ruin\r\nwithout a wife, what would it have mattered? For years past he had\r\nbeen at the same kind of work,--but while he was unmarried there\r\nhad been a charm in the very danger. And as a single man he had\r\nsucceeded, being sometimes utterly impecunious, but still with a\r\ncapacity of living. Now he had laden himself with a burden of which\r\nthe very intensity of his love immensely increased the weight. As for\r\nnot thinking of it, that was impossible. Of course she must help him.\r\nOf course she must be taught how imperative it was that she should\r\nhelp him at once. "Is there anything troubles you?" she said, as she\r\nsat leaning against him after their dinner in the hotel at Dover.\r\n\r\n"What should trouble me on such a day as this?"\r\n\r\n"If there is anything, tell it me. I do not mean to say now, at this\r\nmoment,--unless you wish it. Whatever may be your troubles, it shall\r\nbe my greatest happiness, as it is my first duty, to lessen them if I\r\ncan."\r\n\r\nThe promise was very well. It all went in the right direction. It\r\nshowed him that she was at any rate prepared to take a part in the\r\njoint work of their life. But, nevertheless, she should be spared for\r\nthe moment. "When there is trouble, you shall be told everything," he\r\nsaid, pressing his lips to her brow, "but there is nothing that need\r\ntrouble you yet." He smiled as he said this, but there was something\r\nin the tone of his voice which told her that there would be trouble.\r\n\r\nWhen he was in Paris he received a letter from Parker, to whom he\r\nhad been obliged to intrust a running address, but from whom he had\r\nenforced a promise that there should be no letter-writing unless\r\nunder very pressing circumstances. The circumstances had not been\r\npressing. The letter contained only one paragraph of any importance,\r\nand that was due to what Lopez tried to regard as fidgety cowardice\r\non the part of his ally. "Please to bear in mind that I can\'t and\r\nwon\'t arrange for the bills for L1500 due 3rd February." That was\r\nthe paragraph. Who had asked him to arrange for these bills? And\r\nyet Lopez was well aware that he intended that poor Sexty should\r\n"arrange" for them, in the event of his failure to make arrangements\r\nwith Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\nAt last he was quite unable to let the fortnight pass by without\r\nbeginning the lessons which his wife had to learn. As for that first\r\nintention as to driving his cares out of his own mind for that time,\r\nhe had long since abandoned even the attempt. It was necessary to\r\nhim that a considerable sum of money should be extracted from the\r\nfather-in-law, at any rate before the end of January, and a week or\r\neven a day might be of importance. They had hurried on southwards\r\nfrom Paris, and before the end of the first week had passed over the\r\nSimplon, and were at a pleasant inn on the shores of Como. Everything\r\nin their travels had been as yet delightful to Emily. This man, of\r\nwhom she knew in truth so little, had certain good gifts,--gifts of\r\nintellect, gifts of temper, gifts of voice and manner and outward\r\nappearance,--which had hitherto satisfied her. A husband who is also\r\nan eager lover must be delightful to a young bride. And hitherto no\r\nlover could have been more tender than Lopez. Every word and every\r\nact, every look and every touch, had been loving. Had she known\r\nthe world better she might have felt, perhaps, that something was\r\nexpected where so much was given. Perhaps a rougher manner, with some\r\nlittle touch of marital self-assertion, might be a safer commencement\r\nof married life,--safer to the wife as coming from her husband.\r\nArthur Fletcher by this time would have asked her to bring him his\r\nslippers, taking infinite pride in having his little behests obeyed\r\nby so sweet a servitor. That also would have been pleasant to her had\r\nher heart in the first instance followed his image; but now also the\r\nidolatry of Ferdinand Lopez had been very pleasant.\r\n\r\nBut the moment for the first lesson had come. "Your father has not\r\nwritten to you since you started?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Not a line. He has not known our address. He is never very good at\r\nletter-writing. I did write to him from Paris, and I scribbled a few\r\nwords to Everett yesterday."\r\n\r\n"It is very odd that he should never have written to me."\r\n\r\n"Did you expect him to write?"\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, I rather did. Not that I should have dreamed\r\nof his corresponding with me had he spoken to me on a certain\r\nsubject. But as, on that subject, he never opened his mouth to me, I\r\nalmost thought he would write."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean about money?" she asked in a very low voice.\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes; I do mean about money. Things hitherto have gone so very\r\nstrangely between us. Sit down, dear, till we have a real domestic\r\ntalk."\r\n\r\n"Tell me everything," she said, as she nestled herself close to his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"You know how it was at first between him and me. He objected to me\r\nviolently,--I mean openly, to my face. But he based his objection\r\nsolely on my nationality,--nationality and blood. As to my condition\r\nin the world, fortune, or income, he never asked a word. That was\r\nstrange."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he thought he knew."\r\n\r\n"He could not have thought he knew, dearest. But it was not for me to\r\nforce the subject upon him. You can see that."\r\n\r\n"I am sure whatever you did was right, Ferdinand."\r\n\r\n"He is indisputably a rich man,--one who might be supposed to be able\r\nand willing to give an only daughter a considerable fortune. Now I\r\ncertainly had never thought of marrying for money." Here she rubbed\r\nher face upon his arm. "I felt that it was not for me to speak of\r\nmoney. If he chose to be reticent, I could be so equally. Had he\r\nasked me, I should have told him that I had no fortune, but was\r\nmaking a large though precarious income. It would then be for him\r\nto declare what he intended to do. That would, I think, have been\r\npreferable. As it is we are all in doubt. In my position a knowledge\r\nof what your father intends to do would be most valuable to me."\r\n\r\n"Should you not ask him?"\r\n\r\n"I believe there has always been a perfect confidence between you and\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly,--as to all our ways of living. But he never said a word\r\nto me about money in his life."\r\n\r\n"And yet, my darling, money is most important."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is. I know that, Ferdinand."\r\n\r\n"Would you mind asking?" She did not answer him at once, but sat\r\nthinking. And he also paused before he went on with his lesson.\r\nBut, in order that the lesson should be efficacious, it would be as\r\nwell that he should tell her as much as he could even at this first\r\nlecture. "To tell you the truth, this is quite essential to me at\r\npresent,--very much more than I had thought it would be when we fixed\r\nthe day for our marriage." Her mind within her recoiled at this,\r\nthough she was very careful that he should not feel any such motion\r\nin her body. "My business is precarious."\r\n\r\n"What is your business, Ferdinand?" Poor girl! That she should have\r\nbeen allowed to marry a man, and then have to ask such a question!\r\n\r\n"It is generally commercial. I buy and sell on speculation. The\r\nworld, which is shy of new words, has not yet given it a name. I am\r\na good deal at present in the South American trade." She listened,\r\nbut received no glimmering of an idea from his words. "When we were\r\nengaged everything was as bright as roses with me."\r\n\r\n"Why did you not tell me this before,--so that we might have been\r\nmore prudent?"\r\n\r\n"Such prudence would have been horrid to me. But the fact is that\r\nI should not now have spoken to you at all, but that since we left\r\nEngland I have had letters from a sort of partner of mine. In our\r\nbusiness things will go astray sometimes. It would be of great\r\nservice to me if I could learn what are your father\'s intentions."\r\n\r\n"You want him to give you some money at once."\r\n\r\n"It would not be unusual, dear,--when there is money to be given. But\r\nI want you specially to ask him what he himself would propose to do.\r\nHe knows already that I have taken a home for you and paid for it,\r\nand he knows--. But it does not signify going into that."\r\n\r\n"Tell me everything."\r\n\r\n"He is aware that there are many expenses. Of course if he were a\r\npoor man there would not be a word about it. I can with absolute\r\ntruth declare that had he been penniless it would have made no\r\ndifference as to my suit to you. But it would possibly have made some\r\ndifference as to our after plans. He is a thorough man of the world,\r\nand he must know all that. I am sure he must feel that something is\r\ndue to you,--and to me as your husband. But he is odd-tempered, and,\r\nas I have not spoken to him, he chooses to be silent to me. Now, my\r\ndarling, you and I cannot afford to wait to see who can be silent the\r\nlongest."\r\n\r\n"What do you want me to do?"\r\n\r\n"To write to him."\r\n\r\n"And ask him for money?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly in that way. I think you should say that we should be\r\nglad to know what he intends to do, also saying that a certain sum of\r\nmoney would at present be of use to me."\r\n\r\n"Would it not be better from you? I only ask, Ferdinand. I never have\r\neven spoken to him about money, and of course he would know that you\r\nhad dictated what I said."\r\n\r\n"No doubt he would. It is natural that I should do so. I hope the\r\ntime may come when I may write quite freely to your father myself,\r\nbut hitherto he has hardly been courteous to me. I would rather that\r\nyou should write,--if you do not mind it. Write your own letter, and\r\nshow it me. If there is anything too much or anything too little I\r\nwill tell you."\r\n\r\nAnd so the first lesson was taught. The poor young wife did not at\r\nall like the lesson. Even within her own bosom she found no fault\r\nwith her husband. But she began to understand that the life before\r\nher was not to be a life of roses. The first word spoken to her in\r\nthe train, before it reached Dover, had explained something of this\r\nto her. She had felt at once that there would be trouble about money.\r\nAnd now, though she did not at all understand what might be the\r\nnature of those troubles, though she had derived no information\r\nwhatever from her husband\'s hints about the South American trade,\r\nthough she was as ignorant as ever of his affairs, yet she felt that\r\nthe troubles would come soon. But never for a moment did it seem to\r\nher that he had been unjust in bringing her into troubled waters.\r\nThey had loved each other, and therefore, whatever might be the\r\ntroubles, it was right that they should marry each other. There was\r\nnot a spark of anger against him in her bosom;--but she was unhappy.\r\n\r\nHe demanded from her the writing of the letter almost immediately\r\nafter the conversation which has been given above, and of course the\r\nletter was written,--written and recopied, for the paragraph about\r\nthe money was, of course, at last of his wording. And she could not\r\nmake the remainder of the letter pleasant. The feeling that she was\r\nmaking a demand for money on her father ran through it all. But the\r\nreader need only see the passage in which Ferdinand Lopez made his\r\ndemand,--through her hand.\r\n\r\n"Ferdinand has been speaking to me about my fortune." It had gone\r\nmuch against the grain with her to write these words, "my fortune."\r\n"But I have no fortune," she said. He insisted however, explaining\r\nto her that she was entitled to use these words by her father\'s\r\nundoubted wealth. And so, with an aching heart, she wrote them.\r\n"Ferdinand has been speaking to me about my fortune. Of course, I\r\ntold him that I knew nothing, and that as he had never spoken to\r\nme about money before our marriage, I had never asked about it. He\r\nsays that it would be of great service to him to know what are your\r\nintentions; and also that he hopes you may find it convenient to\r\nallow him to draw upon you for some portion of it at present. He says\r\nthat L3000 would be of great use to him in his business." That was\r\nthe paragraph, and the work of writing it was so distasteful to her\r\nthat she could hardly bring herself to form the letters. It seemed\r\nas though she were seizing the advantage of the first moment of her\r\nfreedom to take a violent liberty with her father.\r\n\r\n"It is altogether his own fault, my pet," he said to her. "I have the\r\ngreatest respect in the world for your father, but he has allowed\r\nhimself to fall into the habit of keeping all his affairs secret from\r\nhis children; and, of course, as they go out into the world, this\r\nsecrecy must in some degree be invaded. There is precisely the same\r\nthing going on between him and Everett; only Everett is a great deal\r\nrougher to him than you are likely to be. He never will let Everett\r\nknow whether he is to regard himself as a rich man or a poor man."\r\n\r\n"He gives him an allowance."\r\n\r\n"Because he cannot help himself. To you he does not do even as much\r\nas that, because he can help himself. I have chosen to leave it to\r\nhim and he has done nothing. But this is not quite fair, and he must\r\nbe told so. I don\'t think he could be told in more dutiful language."\r\n\r\nEmily did not like the idea of telling her father anything which he\r\nmight not like to hear; but her husband\'s behests were to her in\r\nthese, her early married days, quite imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nThe End of the Honeymoon\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Lopez had begged her father to address his reply to her at\r\nFlorence, where,--as she explained to him,--they expected to find\r\nthemselves within a fortnight from the date of her writing. They\r\nhad reached the lake about the end of November, when the weather\r\nhad still been fine, but they intended to pass the winter months\r\nof December and January within the warmth of the cities. That\r\nintervening fortnight was to her a period of painful anticipation.\r\nShe feared to see her father\'s handwriting, feeling almost sure that\r\nhe would be bitterly angry with her. During this time her husband\r\nfrequently spoke to her about the letter,--about her own letter and\r\nher father\'s expected reply. It was necessary that she should learn\r\nher lesson, and she could only do so by having the subject of money\r\nmade familiar to her ears. It was not a part of his plan to tell her\r\nanything of the means by which he hoped to make himself a wealthy\r\nman. The less she knew of that the better. But the fact that her\r\nfather absolutely owed to him a large amount of money as her fortune\r\ncould not be made too clear to her. He was very desirous to do this\r\nin such a manner as not to make her think that he was accusing\r\nher,--or that he would accuse her if the money were not forthcoming.\r\nBut she must learn the fact, and must be imbued with the conviction\r\nthat her husband would be the most ill-treated of men unless the\r\nmoney were forthcoming. "I am a little nervous about it too," said\r\nhe, alluding to the expected letter;--"not so much as to the money\r\nitself, though that is important; but as to his conduct. If he\r\nchooses simply to ignore us after our marriage he will be behaving\r\nvery badly." She had no answer to make to this. She could not defend\r\nher father, because by doing so she would offend her husband. And yet\r\nher whole life-long trust in her father could not allow her to think\r\nit possible that he should behave ill to them.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at Florence he went at once to the post-office, but\r\nthere was as yet no letter. The fortnight, however, which had been\r\nnamed had only just run itself out. They went on from day to day\r\ninspecting buildings, looking at pictures, making for themselves\r\na taste in marble and bronze, visiting the lovely villages which\r\ncluster on the hills round the city,--doing precisely in this respect\r\nas do all young married couples who devote a part of their honeymoon\r\nto Florence;--but in all their little journeyings and in all their\r\nwork of pleasure the inky devil sat not only behind him but behind\r\nher also. The heavy care of life was already beginning to work\r\nfurrows on her face. She would already sit, knitting her brow, as she\r\nthought of coming troubles. Would not her father certainly refuse?\r\nAnd would not her husband then begin to be less loving and less\r\ngracious to herself?\r\n\r\nEvery day for a week he called at the post-office when he went out\r\nwith her, and still the letter did not come. "It can hardly be\r\npossible," he said at last to her, "that he should decline to answer\r\nhis own daughter\'s letter."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he is ill," she replied.\r\n\r\n"If there were anything of that kind Everett would tell us."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he has gone back to Herefordshire?"\r\n\r\n"Of course his letter would go after him. I own it is very singular\r\nto me that he should not write. It looks as though he were determined\r\nto cast you off from him altogether because you have married against\r\nhis wishes."\r\n\r\n"Not that, Ferdinand;--do not say that!"\r\n\r\n"Well; we shall see."\r\n\r\nAnd on the next day they did see. He went to the post-office before\r\nbreakfast, and on this day he returned with a letter in his hand.\r\nShe was sitting waiting for him with a book in her lap, and saw the\r\nletter at once. "Is it from papa?" she said. He nodded his head as\r\nhe handed it to her. "Open it and read it, Ferdinand. I have got\r\nto be so nervous about it, that I cannot do it. It seems to be so\r\nimportant."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it is important," he said with a grim smile, and then he\r\nopened the letter. She watched his face closely as he read it, and at\r\nfirst she could tell nothing from it. Then, in that moment, it first\r\noccurred to her that he had a wonderful command of his features. All\r\nthis, however, lasted but half a minute. Then he chucked the letter,\r\nlightly, in among the tea-cups, and coming to her took her closely in\r\nhis arms and almost hurt her by the violence of his repeated kisses.\r\n\r\n"Has he written kindly?" she said, as soon as she could find her\r\nbreath to speak.\r\n\r\n"By George, he\'s a brick after all. I own I did not think it. My\r\ndarling, how much I owe you for all the trouble I have given you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ferdinand! if he has been good to you I shall be so happy."\r\n\r\n"He has been awfully good. Ha, ha, ha!" And then he began walking\r\nabout the room as he laughed in an unnatural way. "Upon my word it is\r\na pity we didn\'t say four thousand, or five. Think of his taking me\r\njust at my word. It\'s a great deal better than I expected; that\'s all\r\nI can say. And at the present moment it is of the utmost importance\r\nto me."\r\n\r\nAll this did not take above a minute or two, but during that minute\r\nor two she had been so bewildered by his manner as almost to fancy\r\nthat the expressions of his delight had been ironical. He had been\r\nso unlike himself as she had known him that she almost doubted the\r\nreality of his joy. But when she took the letter and read it, she\r\nfound that his joy was true enough. The letter was very short, and\r\nwas as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR EMILY,\r\n\r\n   What you have said under your husband\'s instruction about\r\n   money, I find upon consideration to be fair enough. I\r\n   think he should have spoken to me before his marriage; but\r\n   then again perhaps I ought to have spoken to him. As it\r\n   is, I am willing to give him the sum he requires, and I\r\n   will pay L3000 to his account, if he would tell me where\r\n   he would have it lodged. Then I shall think I have done\r\n   my duty by him. What I shall do with the remainder of any\r\n   money that I may have, I do not think he is entitled to\r\n   ask.\r\n\r\n   Everett is well again, and as idle as ever. Your aunt Roby\r\n   is making a fool of herself at Harrogate. I have heard\r\n   nothing from Herefordshire. Everything is very quiet and\r\n   lonely here.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n   A. WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he had dined at the Eldon every day since his daughter had left\r\nhim, and had played on an average a dozen rubbers of whist daily, he\r\nwas not justified in complaining of the loneliness of London.\r\n\r\nThe letter seemed to Emily herself to be very cold, and had not her\r\nhusband rejoiced over it so warmly she would have considered it to be\r\nunsatisfactory. No doubt the L3000 would be given; but that, as far\r\nas she could understand her father\'s words, was to be the whole of\r\nher fortune. She had never known anything of her father\'s affairs or\r\nof his intentions, but she had certainly supposed that her fortune\r\nwould be very much more than this. She had learned in some indirect\r\nway that a large sum of money would have gone with her hand to\r\nArthur Fletcher, could she have brought herself to marry that\r\nsuitor favoured by her family. And now, having learned, as she had\r\nlearned, that money was of vital importance to her husband, she was\r\ndismayed at what seemed to her to be parental parsimony. But he was\r\noverjoyed,--so much so that for a while he lost that restraint over\r\nhimself which was habitual to him. He ate his breakfast in a state of\r\nexultation, and talked,--not alluding specially to this L3000,--as\r\nthough he had the command of almost unlimited means. He ordered a\r\ncarriage and drove her out, and bought presents for her,--things\r\nas to which they had both before decided that they should not be\r\nbought because of the expense. "Pray don\'t spend your money for me,"\r\nshe said to him. "It is nice to have you giving me things, but it\r\nwould be nicer to me even than that to think that I could save you\r\nexpense."\r\n\r\nBut he was not in a mood to be denied. "You don\'t understand," he\r\nsaid. "I don\'t want to be saved from little extravagances of this\r\nsort. Owing to circumstances, your father\'s money was at this moment\r\nof importance to me;--but he has answered to the whip and the money\r\nis there, and that trouble is over. We can enjoy ourselves now. Other\r\ntroubles will spring up, no doubt, before long."\r\n\r\nShe did not quite like being told that her father had "answered to\r\nthe whip,"--but she was willing to believe that it was a phrase\r\ncommon among men to which it would be prudish to make objection.\r\nThere was, also, something in her husband\'s elation which was\r\ndistasteful to her. Could it be that reverses of fortune with\r\nreference to moderate sums of money, such as this which was now\r\ncoming into his hands, would always affect him in the same way? Was\r\nit not almost unmanly, or at any rate was it not undignified? And yet\r\nshe tried to make the best of it, and lent herself to his holiday\r\nmood as well as she was able. "Shall I write and thank papa?" she\r\nsaid that evening.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking of that," he said. "You can write if you like,\r\nand of course you will. But I also will write, and had better do so\r\na post or two before you. As he has come round I suppose I ought to\r\nshow myself civil. What he says about the rest of his money is of\r\ncourse absurd. I shall ask him nothing about it, but no doubt after a\r\nbit he will make permanent arrangements." Everything in the business\r\nwounded her more or less. She now perceived that he regarded this\r\nL3000 only as the first instalment of what he might get, and that his\r\njoy was due simply to this temporary success. And then he called her\r\nfather absurd to her face. For a moment she thought that she would\r\ndefend her father; but she could not as yet bring herself to question\r\nher husband\'s words even on such a subject as that.\r\n\r\nHe did write to Mr. Wharton, but in doing so he altogether laid aside\r\nthat flighty manner which for a while had annoyed her. He thoroughly\r\nunderstood that the wording of the letter might be very important to\r\nhim, and he took much trouble with it. It must be now the great work\r\nof his life to ingratiate himself with this old man, so that, at any\r\nrate at the old man\'s death, he might possess at least half of the\r\nold man\'s money. He must take care that there should be no division\r\nbetween his wife and her father of such a nature as to make the\r\nfather think that his son ought to enjoy any special privilege of\r\nprimogeniture or of male inheritance. And if it could be so managed\r\nthat the daughter should, before the old man\'s death, become his\r\nfavourite child, that also would be well. He was therefore very\r\ncareful about the letter, which was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. WHARTON,\r\n\r\n   I cannot let your letter to Emily pass without thanking\r\n   you myself for the very liberal response made by you to\r\n   what was of course a request from myself. Let me in the\r\n   first place assure you that had you, before our marriage,\r\n   made any inquiry about my money affairs, I would have told\r\n   you everything with accuracy; but as you did not do so\r\n   I thought that I should seem to intrude upon you, if I\r\n   introduced the subject. It is too long for a letter, but\r\n   whenever you may like to allude to it, you will find that\r\n   I will be quite open with you.\r\n\r\n   I am engaged in business which often requires the use of\r\n   a considerable amount of capital. It has so happened that\r\n   even since we were married the immediate use of a sum of\r\n   money became essential to me to save me from sacrificing a\r\n   cargo of guano which will be of greatly increased value in\r\n   three months\' time, but which otherwise must have gone for\r\n   what it would now fetch. Your kindness will see me through\r\n   that difficulty.\r\n\r\n   Of course there is something precarious in such a\r\n   business as mine;--but I am endeavouring to make it less\r\n   so from day to day, and hope very shortly to bring it\r\n   into that humdrum groove which best befits a married man.\r\n   Should I ask further assistance from you in doing this,\r\n   perhaps you will not refuse it if I can succeed in making\r\n   the matter clear to you. As it is I thank you sincerely\r\n   for what you have done. I will ask you to pay the L3000\r\n   you have so kindly promised, to my account at Messrs.\r\n   Hunky and Sons, Lombard Street. They are not regular\r\n   bankers, but I have an account there.\r\n\r\n   We are wandering about and enjoying ourselves mightily in\r\n   the properly romantic manner. Emily sometimes seems to\r\n   think that she would like to give up business, and London,\r\n   and all sublunary troubles, in order that she might settle\r\n   herself for life under an Italian sky. But the idea does\r\n   not generally remain with her very long. Already she is\r\n   beginning to show symptoms of home sickness in regard to\r\n   Manchester Square.\r\n\r\n   Yours always most faithfully,\r\n\r\n   FERDINAND LOPEZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this letter Lopez received no reply;--nor did he expect one.\r\nBetween Emily and her father a few letters passed, not very long;\r\nnor, as regarded those from Mr. Wharton, were they very interesting.\r\nIn none of them, however, was there any mention of money. But early\r\nin January Lopez received a most pressing,--we might almost say an\r\nagonising letter from his friend Parker. The gist of the letter\r\nwas to make Lopez understand that Parker must at once sell certain\r\ninterests in a coming cargo of guano,--at whatever sacrifice,--unless\r\nhe could be certified as to that money which must be paid in\r\nFebruary, and which he, Parker, must pay, should Ferdinand Lopez be\r\nat that moment unable to meet his bond. The answer sent to Parker\r\nshall be given to the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR OLD AWFULLY SILLY, AND ABSURDLY IMPATIENT FRIEND,\r\n\r\n   You are always like a toad under a harrow, and that\r\n   without the slightest cause. I have money lying at Hunky\'s\r\n   more than double enough for the bills. Why can\'t you trust\r\n   a man? If you won\'t trust me in saying so, you can go to\r\n   Mills Happerton and ask him. But, remember, I shall be\r\n   very much annoyed if you do so,--and that such an inquiry\r\n   cannot but be injurious to me. If, however, you won\'t\r\n   believe me, you can go and ask. At any rate, don\'t meddle\r\n   with the guano. We should lose over L1000 each of us, if\r\n   you were to do so. By George, a man should neither marry,\r\n   nor leave London for a day, if he has to do with a fellow\r\n   so nervous as you are. As it is I think I shall be back\r\n   a week or two before my time is properly up, lest you\r\n   and one or two others should think that I have levanted\r\n   altogether.\r\n\r\n   I have no hesitation in saying that more fortunes are lost\r\n   in business by trembling cowardice than by any amount of\r\n   imprudence or extravagance. My hair stands on end when you\r\n   talk of parting with guano in December because there are\r\n   bills which have to be met in February. Pluck up your\r\n   heart, man, and look around, and see what is done by men\r\n   with good courage.\r\n\r\n   Yours always,\r\n\r\n   FERDINAND LOPEZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were the only communications between our married couple and\r\ntheir friends at home with which I need trouble my readers. Nor need\r\nI tell any further tales of their honeymoon. If the time was not one\r\nof complete and unalloyed joy to Emily,--and we must fear that it\r\nwas not,--it is to be remembered that but very little complete and\r\nunalloyed joy is allowed to sojourners in this vale of tears, even\r\nthough they have been but two months married. In the first week in\r\nFebruary they appeared in the Belgrave mansion, and Emily Lopez took\r\npossession of her new home with a heart as full of love for her\r\nhusband as it had been when she walked out of the church in Vere\r\nStreet, though it may be that some of her sweetest illusions had\r\nalready been dispelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nThe Duke\'s Misery\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must go back for a while to Gatherum Castle and see the guests\r\nwhom the Duchess had collected there for her Christmas festivities.\r\nThe hospitality of the Duke\'s house had been maintained almost\r\nthroughout the autumn. Just at the end of October they went to\r\nMatching, for what the Duchess called a quiet month,--which, however,\r\nat the Duke\'s urgent request became six weeks. But even here the\r\nhouse was full all the time, though from deficiency of bedrooms the\r\nguests were very much less numerous. But at Matching the Duchess had\r\nbeen uneasy and almost cross. Mrs. Finn had gone with her husband to\r\nIreland, and she had taught herself to fancy that she could not live\r\nwithout Mrs. Finn. And her husband had insisted upon having round\r\nhim politicians of his own sort, men who really preferred work to\r\narchery, or even to hunting, and who discussed the evils of direct\r\ntaxation absolutely in the drawing-room. The Duchess was assured\r\nthat the country could not be governed by the support of such men as\r\nthese, and was very glad to get back to Gatherum,--whither also came\r\nPhineas Finn with his wife, and the St. Bungay people, and Barrington\r\nErle, and Mr. Monk, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with Lord and\r\nLady Cantrip, and Lord and Lady Drummond,--Lord Drummond being the\r\nonly representative of the other or coalesced party. And Major\r\nPountney was there, having been urgent with the Duchess,--and having\r\nfully explained to his friend Captain Gunner that he had acceded to\r\nthe wishes of his hostess only on the assurance of her Grace that\r\nthe house would not be again troubled by the presence of Ferdinand\r\nLopez. Such assurances were common between the two friends, but were\r\ninnocent, as, of course, neither believed the other. And Lady Rosina\r\nwas again there,--with many others. The melancholy poverty of Lady\r\nRosina had captivated the Duke. "She shall come and live here, if you\r\nlike," the Duchess had said in answer to a request from her husband\r\non his new friend\'s behalf,--"I\'ve no doubt she will be willing." The\r\nplace was not crowded as it had been before; but still about thirty\r\nguests sat down to dinner daily, and Locock, Millepois, and Mrs.\r\nPritchard were all kept hard at work. Nor was our Duchess idle.\r\nShe was always making up the party,--meaning the coalition,--doing\r\nsomething to strengthen the buttresses, writing little letters\r\nto little people, who, little as they were, might become big by\r\namalgamation. "One has always to be binding one\'s fagot," she said to\r\nMrs. Finn, having read her Aesop not altogether in vain. "Where should\r\nwe have been without you?" she had whispered to Sir Orlando Drought\r\nwhen that gentleman was leaving Gatherum at the termination of his\r\nsecond visit. She had particularly disliked Sir Orlando, and was\r\naware that her husband had on this occasion been hardly as gracious\r\nas he should have been, in true policy, to so powerful a colleague.\r\nHer husband had been peculiarly shy of Sir Orlando since the day\r\non which they had walked together in the park,--and, consequently,\r\nthe Duchess had whispered to him. "Don\'t bind your fagot too\r\nconspicuously," Mrs. Finn had said to her. Then the Duchess had\r\nfallen to a seat almost exhausted by labour, mingled with regrets,\r\nand by the doubts which from time to time pervaded even her audacious\r\nspirit. "I\'m not a god," she said, "or a Pitt, or an Italian with a\r\nlong name beginning with M., that I should be able to do these things\r\nwithout ever making a mistake. And yet they must be done. And as for\r\nhim,--he does not help me in the least. He wanders about among the\r\nclouds of the multiplication table, and thinks that a majority will\r\ndrop into his mouth because he does not shut it. Can you tie the\r\nfagot any better?" "I think I would leave it untied," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n"You would not do anything of the kind. You\'d be just as fussy as I\r\nam." And thus the game was carried on at Gatherum Castle from week to\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n"But you won\'t leave him?" This was said to Phineas Finn by his wife\r\na day or two before Christmas, and the question was intended to ask\r\nwhether Phineas thought of giving up his place.\r\n\r\n"Not if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"You like the work."\r\n\r\n"That has but little to do with the question, unfortunately. I\r\ncertainly like having something to do. I like earning money."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you like that especially," said the wife, laughing.\r\n\r\n"I do at any rate,--and, in a certain sense, I like authority. But in\r\nserving with the Duke I find a lack of that sympathy which one should\r\nhave with one\'s chief. He would never say a word to me unless I spoke\r\nto him. And when I do speak, though he is studiously civil,--much\r\ntoo courteous,--I know that he is bored. He has nothing to say to me\r\nabout the country. When he has anything to communicate, he prefers to\r\nwrite a minute for Warburton, who then writes to Morton,--and so it\r\nreaches me."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t it do as well?"\r\n\r\n"It may do with me. There are reasons which bind me to him, which\r\nwill not bind other men. Men don\'t talk to me about it, because\r\nthey know that I am bound to him through you. But I am aware of the\r\nfeeling which exists. You can\'t be really loyal to a king if you\r\nnever see him,--if he be always locked up in some almost divine\r\nrecess."\r\n\r\n"A king may make himself too common, Phineas."\r\n\r\n"No doubt. A king has to know where to draw the line. But the Duke\r\ndraws no intentional line at all. He is not by nature gregarious or\r\ncommunicative, and is therefore hardly fitted to be the head of a\r\nministry."\r\n\r\n"It will break her heart if anything goes wrong."\r\n\r\n"She ought to remember that Ministries seldom live very long," said\r\nPhineas. "But she\'ll recover even if she does break her heart. She is\r\ntoo full of vitality to be much repressed by any calamity. Have you\r\nheard what is to be done about Silverbridge?"\r\n\r\n"The Duchess wants to get it for this man, Ferdinand Lopez."\r\n\r\n"But it has not been promised yet?"\r\n\r\n"The seat is not vacant," said Mrs. Finn, "and I don\'t know when it\r\nwill be vacant. I think there is a hitch about it,--and I think the\r\nDuchess is going to be made very angry."\r\n\r\nThroughout the autumn the Duke had been an unhappy man. While the\r\nabsolute work of the Session had lasted he had found something\r\nto console him; but now, though he was surrounded by private\r\nsecretaries, and though dispatch-boxes went and came twice a day,\r\nthough there were dozens of letters as to which he had to give some\r\ninstruction,--yet, there was in truth nothing for him to do. It\r\nseemed to him that all the real work of the Government had been\r\nfilched from him by his colleagues, and that he was stuck up in\r\npretended authority,--a kind of wooden Prime Minister, from whom no\r\nreal ministration was demanded. His first fear had been that he was\r\nhimself unfit;--but now he was uneasy, fearing that others thought\r\nhim to be unfit. There was Mr. Monk with his budget, and Lord\r\nDrummond with his three or four dozen half rebellious colonies, and\r\nSir Orlando Drought with the House to lead and a ship to build, and\r\nPhineas Finn with his scheme of municipal Home Rule for Ireland, and\r\nLord Ramsden with a codified Statute Book,--all full of work, all\r\nwith something special to be done. But for him,--he had to arrange\r\nwho should attend the Queen, what ribbons should be given away, and\r\nwhat middle-aged young man should move the address. He sighed as he\r\nthought of those happy days in which he used to fear that his mind\r\nand body would both give way under the pressure of decimal coinage.\r\n\r\nBut Phineas Finn had read the Duke\'s character rightly in saying that\r\nhe was neither gregarious nor communicative, and therefore but little\r\nfitted to rule Englishmen. He had thought that it was so himself,\r\nand now from day to day he was becoming more assured of his own\r\ndeficiency. He could not throw himself into cordial relations with\r\nthe Sir Orlando Droughts, or even with the Mr. Monks. But, though he\r\nhad never wished to be put into his present high office, now that\r\nhe was there he dreaded the sense of failure which would follow his\r\ndescent from it. It is this feeling rather than genuine ambition,\r\nrather than the love of power or patronage or pay, which induces men\r\nto cling to place. The absence of real work, and the quantity of mock\r\nwork, both alike made the life wearisome to him; but he could not\r\nendure the idea that it should be written in history that he had\r\nallowed himself to be made a faineant Prime Minister, and then had\r\nfailed even in that. History would forget what he had done as a\r\nworking Minister in recording the feebleness of the Ministry which\r\nwould bear his name.\r\n\r\nThe one man with whom he could talk freely, and from whom he could\r\ntake advice, was now with him, here at his Castle. He was shy at\r\nfirst even with the Duke of St. Bungay, but that shyness he could\r\ngenerally overcome, after a few words. But though he was always sure\r\nof his old friend\'s sympathy and of his old friend\'s wisdom, yet he\r\ndoubted his old friend\'s capacity to understand himself. The young\r\nDuke felt the old Duke to be thicker-skinned than himself and\r\ntherefore unable to appreciate the thorns which so sorely worried his\r\nown flesh. "They talk to me about a policy," said the host. They were\r\ncloseted at this time in the Prime Minister\'s own sanctum, and there\r\nyet remained an hour before they need dress for dinner.\r\n\r\n"Who talks about a policy?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Orlando Drought especially." For the Duke of Omnium had never\r\nforgotten the arrogance of that advice given in the park.\r\n\r\n"Sir Orlando is of course entitled to speak, though I do not know\r\nthat he is likely to say anything very well worth the hearing. What\r\nis his special policy?"\r\n\r\n"If he had any, of course, I would hear him. It is not that he wants\r\nany special thing to be done, but he thinks that I should get up some\r\nspecial thing in order that Parliament may be satisfied."\r\n\r\n"If you wanted to create a majority that might be true. Just listen\r\nto him and have done with it."\r\n\r\n"I cannot go on in that way. I cannot submit to what amounts to\r\ncomplaint from the gentlemen who are acting with me. Nor would they\r\nsubmit long to my silence. I am beginning to feel that I have been\r\nwrong."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you have been wrong at all."\r\n\r\n"A man is wrong if he attempts to carry a weight too great for his\r\nstrength."\r\n\r\n"A certain nervous sensitiveness, from which you should free yourself\r\nas from a disease, is your only source of weakness. Think about your\r\nbusiness as a shoemaker thinks of his. Do your best, and then let\r\nyour customers judge for themselves. Caveat emptor. A man should\r\nnever endeavour to price himself, but should accept the price which\r\nothers put on him,--only being careful that he should learn what that\r\nprice is. Your policy should be to keep your government together by a\r\nstrong majority. After all, the making of new laws is too often but\r\nan unfortunate necessity laid on us by the impatience of the people.\r\nA lengthened period of quiet and therefore good government with a\r\nminimum of new laws would be the greatest benefit the country could\r\nreceive. When I recommended you to comply with the Queen\'s behest I\r\ndid so because I thought that you might inaugurate such a period more\r\ncertainly than any other one man." This old Duke was quite content\r\nwith a state of things such as he described. He had been a Cabinet\r\nMinister for more than half his life. He liked being a Cabinet\r\nMinister. He thought it well for the country generally that his party\r\nshould be in power,--and if not his party in its entirety, then as\r\nmuch of his party as might be possible. He did not expect to be\r\nwritten of as a Pitt or a Somers, but he thought that memoirs would\r\nspeak of him as a useful nobleman,--and he was contented. He was\r\nnot only not ambitious himself, but the effervescence and general\r\nturbulence of ambition in other men was distasteful to him. Loyalty\r\nwas second nature to him, and the power of submitting to defeat\r\nwithout either shame or sorrow had become perfect with him by\r\nlong practice. He would have made his brother Duke such as he was\r\nhimself,--had not his brother Duke been so lamentably thin-skinned.\r\n\r\n"I suppose we must try it for another Session?" said the Duke of\r\nOmnium with a lachrymose voice.\r\n\r\n"Of course we must,--and for others after that, I both hope and\r\ntrust," said the Duke of St. Bungay, getting up. "If I don\'t go\r\nup-stairs I shall be late, and then her Grace will look at me with\r\nunforgiving eyes."\r\n\r\nOn the following day after lunch the Prime Minister took a walk with\r\nLady Rosina De Courcy. He had fallen into a habit of walking with\r\nLady Rosina almost every day of his life, till the people in the\r\nCastle began to believe that Lady Rosina was the mistress of some\r\ndeep policy of her own. For there were many there who did in truth\r\nthink that statecraft could never be absent from a minister\'s mind,\r\nday or night. But in truth Lady Rosina chiefly made herself agreeable\r\nto the Prime Minister by never making any most distant allusion\r\nto public affairs. It might be doubted whether she even knew that\r\nthe man who paid her so much honour was the Head of the British\r\nGovernment as well as the Duke of Omnium. She was a tall, thin,\r\nshrivelled-up old woman,--not very old, fifty perhaps, but looking\r\nat least ten years more,--very melancholy, and sometimes very cross.\r\nShe had been notably religious, but that was gradually wearing off as\r\nshe advanced in years. The rigid strictness of Sabbatarian practice\r\nrequires the full energy of middle life. She had been left entirely\r\nalone in the world, with a very small income, and not many friends\r\nwho were in any way interested in her existence. But she knew herself\r\nto be Lady Rosina De Courcy, and felt that the possession of that\r\nname ought to be more to her than money and friends, or even than\r\nbrothers and sisters. "The weather is not frightening you," said the\r\nDuke. Snow had fallen, and the paths, even where they had been swept,\r\nwere wet and sloppy.\r\n\r\n"Weather never frightens me, your Grace. I always have thick\r\nboots;--I am very particular about that;--and cork soles."\r\n\r\n"Cork soles are admirable."\r\n\r\n"I think I owe my life to cork soles," said Lady Rosina\r\nenthusiastically. "There is a man named Sprout in Silverbridge who\r\nmakes them. Did your Grace ever try him for boots?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I ever did," said the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n"Then you had better. He\'s very good and very cheap too. Those London\r\ntradesmen never think they can charge you enough. I find I can wear\r\nSprout\'s boots the whole winter through and then have them resoled. I\r\ndon\'t suppose you ever think of such things?"\r\n\r\n"I like to have my feet dry."\r\n\r\n"I have got to calculate what they cost." They then passed Major\r\nPountney, who was coming and going between the stables and the house,\r\nand who took off his hat and who saluted the host and his companion\r\nwith perhaps more flowing courtesy than was necessary. "I never have\r\nfound out what that gentleman\'s name is yet," said Lady Rosina.\r\n\r\n"Pountney, I think. I believe they call him Major Pountney."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pountney! There are Pountneys in Leicestershire. Perhaps he is\r\none of them?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know where he comes from," said the Duke,--"nor, to tell\r\nthe truth, where he goes to." Lady Rosina looked up at him with an\r\ninterested air. "He seems to be one of those idle men who get into\r\npeople\'s houses heaven knows why, and never do anything."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you asked him?" said Lady Rosina.\r\n\r\n"The Duchess did, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"How odd it would be if she were to suppose that you had asked him."\r\n\r\n"The Duchess, no doubt, knows all about it." Then there was a little\r\npause. "She is obliged to have all sorts of people," said the Duke\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so,--when you have so many coming and going. I am sorry\r\nto say that my time is up to-morrow, so that I shall make way for\r\nsomebody else."\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t think of going, Lady Rosina,--unless you are\r\nengaged elsewhere. We are delighted to have you."\r\n\r\n"The Duchess has been very kind, but--"\r\n\r\n"The Duchess, I fear, is almost too much engaged to see as much of\r\nher guests individually as she ought to do. To me your being here is\r\na great pleasure."\r\n\r\n"You are too good to me,--much too good. But I shall have stayed\r\nout my time, and I think, Duke, I will go to-morrow. I am very\r\nmethodical, you know, and always act by rule. I have walked my two\r\nmiles now, and I will go in. If you do want boots with cork soles\r\nmind you go to Sprout\'s. Dear me; there is that Major Pountney again.\r\nThat is four times he has been up and down that path since we have\r\nbeen walking here."\r\n\r\nLady Rosina went in, and the Duke turned back, thinking of his friend\r\nand perhaps thinking of the cork soles of which she had to be so\r\ncareful and which were so important to her comfort. It could not be\r\nthat he fancied Lady Rosina to be clever, nor can we imagine that her\r\nconversation satisfied any of those wants to which he and all of us\r\nare subject. But nevertheless he liked Lady Rosina, and was never\r\nbored by her. She was natural, and she wanted nothing from him. When\r\nshe talked about cork soles she meant cork soles. And then she did\r\nnot tread on any of his numerous corns. As he walked on he determined\r\nthat he would induce his wife to persuade Lady Rosina to stay a\r\nlittle longer at the Castle. In meditating upon this he made another\r\nturn in the grounds, and again came upon Major Pountney as that\r\ngentleman was returning from the stables. "A very cold afternoon," he\r\nsaid, feeling it to be ungracious to pass one of his own guests in\r\nhis own grounds without a word of salutation.\r\n\r\n"Very cold indeed, your Grace,--very cold." The Duke had intended\r\nto pass on, but the Major managed to stop him by standing in the\r\npathway. The Major did not in the least know his man. He had heard\r\nthat the Duke was shy, and therefore thought that he was timid. He\r\nhad not hitherto been spoken to by the Duke,--a condition of things\r\nwhich he attributed to the Duke\'s shyness and timidity. But, with\r\nmuch thought on the subject, he had resolved that he would have a few\r\nwords with his host, and had therefore passed backwards and forwards\r\nbetween the house and the stables rather frequently. "Very cold,\r\nindeed, but yet we\'ve had beautiful weather. I don\'t know when I have\r\nenjoyed myself so much altogether as I have at Gatherum Castle."\r\nThe Duke bowed, and made a little but a vain effort to get on. "A\r\nsplendid pile!" said the Major, stretching his hand gracefully\r\ntowards the building.\r\n\r\n"It is a big house," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"A noble mansion;--perhaps the noblest mansion in the three\r\nkingdoms," said Major Pountney. "I have seen a great many of the\r\nbest country residences in England, but nothing that at all equals\r\nGatherum." Then the Duke made a little effort at progression, but\r\nwas still stopped by the daring Major. "By-the-by, your Grace, if\r\nyour Grace has a few minutes to spare,--just half a minute,--I wish\r\nyou would allow me to say something." The Duke assumed a look of\r\ndisturbance, but he bowed and walked on, allowing the Major to walk\r\nby his side. "I have the greatest possible desire, my Lord Duke, to\r\nenter public life."\r\n\r\n"I thought you were already in the army," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"So I am;--was on Sir Bartholomew Bone\'s staff in Canada for two\r\nyears, and have seen as much of what I call home service as any man\r\ngoing. One of my chief objects is to take up the army."\r\n\r\n"It seems that you have taken it up."\r\n\r\n"I mean in Parliament, your Grace. I am very fairly off as regards\r\nprivate means, and would stand all the racket of the expense of a\r\ncontest myself,--if there were one. But the difficulty is to get a\r\nseat, and, of course, if it can be privately managed, it is very\r\ncomfortable." The Duke looked at him again,--this time without\r\nbowing. But the Major, who was not observant, rushed on to his\r\ndestruction. "We all know that Silverbridge will soon be vacant. Let\r\nme assure your Grace that if it might be consistent with your Grace\'s\r\nplans in other respects to turn your kind countenance towards me,\r\nyou would find that you would have a supporter than whom none would\r\nbe more staunch, and perhaps I may say, one who in the House would\r\nnot be the least useful!" That portion of the Major\'s speech which\r\nreferred to the Duke\'s kind countenance had been learned by heart,\r\nand was thrown trippingly off the tongue with a kind of twang. The\r\nMajor had perceived that he had not been at once interrupted when\r\nhe began to open the budget of his political aspirations, and had\r\nallowed himself to indulge in pleasing auguries. "Nothing ask and\r\nnothing have," had been adopted as the motto of his life, and\r\nmore than once he had expressed to Captain Gunner his conviction\r\nthat,--"By George, if you\'ve only cheek enough, there is nothing you\r\ncannot get." On this emergency the Major certainly was not deficient\r\nin cheek. "If I might be allowed to consider myself your Grace\'s\r\ncandidate, I should indeed be a happy man," said the Major.\r\n\r\n"I think, sir," said the Duke, "that your proposition is the most\r\nunbecoming and the most impertinent that ever was addressed to me."\r\nThe Major\'s mouth fell, and he stared with all his eyes as he looked\r\nup into the Duke\'s face. "Good afternoon," said the Duke, turning\r\nquickly round and walking away. The Major stood for a while\r\ntransfixed to the place, and, cold as was the weather, was bathed in\r\nperspiration. A keen sense of having "put his foot into it" almost\r\ncrushed him for a time. Then he assured himself that, after all, the\r\nDuke "could not eat him," and with that consolatory reflection he\r\ncrept back to the house and up to his own room.\r\n\r\nTo put the man down had of course been an easy task to the Duke, but\r\nhe was not satisfied with that. To the Major it seemed that the Duke\r\nhad passed on with easy indifference;--but in truth he was very far\r\nfrom being easy. The man\'s insolent request had wounded him at many\r\npoints. It was grievous to him that he should have as a guest in his\r\nown house a man whom he had been forced to insult. It was grievous\r\nto him that he himself should not have been held in personal respect\r\nhigh enough to protect him from such an insult. It was grievous to\r\nhim that he should be openly addressed,--addressed by an absolute\r\nstranger,--as a borough-mongering lord, who would not scruple to give\r\naway a seat in Parliament as seats were given away in former days.\r\nAnd it was especially grievous to him that all these misfortunes\r\nshould have come upon him as a part of the results of his wife\'s\r\nmanner of exercising his hospitality. If this was to be Prime\r\nMinister he certainly would not be Prime Minister much longer!\r\nHad any aspirant to political life ever dared so to address Lord\r\nBrock, or Lord De Terrier, or Mr. Mildmay, the old Premiers whom he\r\nremembered? He thought not. They had managed differently. They had\r\nbeen able to defend themselves from such attacks by personal dignity.\r\nAnd would it have been possible that any man should have dared so to\r\nspeak to his uncle, the late Duke? He thought not. As he shut himself\r\nup in his own room he grieved inwardly with a deep grief. After a\r\nwhile he walked off to his wife\'s room, still perturbed in spirit.\r\nThe perturbation had indeed increased from minute to minute. He would\r\nrather give up politics altogether and shut himself up in absolute\r\nseclusion than find himself subject to the insolence of any Pountney\r\nthat might address him. With his wife he found Mrs. Finn. Now for\r\nthis lady personally he entertained what for him was a warm regard.\r\nIn various matters of much importance he and she had been brought\r\ntogether, and she had, to his thinking, invariably behaved well. And\r\nan intimacy had been established which had enabled him to be at ease\r\nwith her,--so that her presence was often a comfort to him. But at\r\nthe present moment he had not wished to find any one with his wife,\r\nand felt that she was in his way. "Perhaps I am disturbing you," he\r\nsaid in a tone of voice that was solemn and almost funereal.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said the Duchess, who was in high spirits. "I want to\r\nget your promise now about Silverbridge. Don\'t mind her. Of course\r\nshe knows everything." To be told that any body knew everything was\r\nanother shock to him. "I have just got a letter from Mr. Lopez."\r\nCould it be right that his wife should be corresponding on such a\r\nsubject with a person so little known as this Mr. Lopez? "May I tell\r\nhim that he shall have your interest when the seat is vacant?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said the Duke, with a scowl that was terrible even\r\nto his wife. "I wished to speak to you, but I wished to speak to you\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"I beg a thousand pardons," said Mrs. Finn, preparing to go.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stir, Marie," said the Duchess; "he is going to be cross."\r\n\r\n"If Mrs. Finn will allow me, with every feeling of the most perfect\r\nrespect and sincerest regard, to ask her to leave me with you for\r\na few minutes, I shall be obliged. And if, with her usual hearty\r\nkindness, she will pardon my abruptness--" Then he could not go on,\r\nhis emotion being too great; but he put out his hand, and taking hers\r\nraised it to his lips and kissed it. The moment had become too solemn\r\nfor any further hesitation as to the lady\'s going. The Duchess for a\r\nmoment was struck dumb, and Mrs. Finn, of course, left the room.\r\n\r\n"In the name of heaven, Plantagenet, what is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Who is Major Pountney?"\r\n\r\n"Who is Major Pountney! How on earth should I know? He is--Major\r\nPountney. He is about everywhere."\r\n\r\n"Do not let him be asked into any house of mine again. But that is a\r\ntrifle."\r\n\r\n"Anything about Major Pountney must, I should think, be a trifle.\r\nHave tidings come that the heavens are going to fall? Nothing short\r\nof that could make you so solemn."\r\n\r\n"In the first place, Glencora, let me ask you not to speak to me\r\nagain about the seat for Silverbridge. I am not at present prepared\r\nto argue the matter with you, but I have resolved that I will know\r\nnothing about the election. As soon as the seat is vacant, if it\r\nshould be vacated, I shall take care that my determination be known\r\nin Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Why should you abandon your privileges in that way? It is sheer\r\nweakness."\r\n\r\n"The interference of any peer is unconstitutional."\r\n\r\n"There is Braxon," said the Duchess energetically, "where the Marquis\r\nof Crumber returns the member regularly, in spite of all their Reform\r\nbills; and Bamford, and Cobblersborough;--and look at Lord Lumley\r\nwith a whole county in his pocket, not to speak of two boroughs! What\r\nnonsense, Plantagenet! Anything is constitutional, or anything is\r\nunconstitutional, just as you choose to look at it." It was clear\r\nthat the Duchess had really studied the subject carefully.\r\n\r\n"Very well, my dear, let it be nonsense. I only beg to assure you\r\nthat it is my intention, and I request you to act accordingly. And\r\nthere is another thing I have to say to you. I shall be sorry to\r\ninterfere in any way with the pleasure which you may derive from\r\nsociety, but as long as I am burdened with the office which has been\r\nimposed upon me, I will not again entertain any guests in my own\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Plantagenet!"\r\n\r\n"You cannot turn the people out who are here now; but I beg that they\r\nmay be allowed to go as the time comes, and that their places may not\r\nbe filled by further invitations."\r\n\r\n"But further invitations have gone out ever so long ago, and have\r\nbeen accepted. You must be ill, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Ill at ease,--yes. At any rate let none others be sent out." Then\r\nhe remembered a kindly purpose which he had formed early in the day,\r\nand fell back upon that. "I should, however, be glad if you would\r\nask Lady Rosina De Courcy to remain here." The Duchess stared at him,\r\nreally thinking now that something was amiss with him. "The whole\r\nthing is a failure and I will have no more of it. It is degrading\r\nme." Then without allowing her a moment in which to answer him, he\r\nmarched back to his own room.\r\n\r\nBut even here his spirit was not as yet at rest. That Major must\r\nnot go unpunished. Though he hated all fuss and noise he must do\r\nsomething. So he wrote as follows to the Major:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Duke of Omnium trusts that Major Pountney will not\r\n   find it inconvenient to leave Gatherum Castle shortly.\r\n   Should Major Pountney wish to remain at the Castle over\r\n   the night, the Duke of Omnium hopes that he will not\r\n   object to be served with his dinner and with his breakfast\r\n   in his own room. A carriage and horses will be ready for\r\n   Major Pountney\'s use, to take him to Silverbridge, as soon\r\n   as Major Pountney may express to the servants his wish to\r\n   that effect.\r\n\r\n   Gatherum Castle, -- December, 18--.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis note the Duke sent by the hands of his own servant, having said\r\nenough to the man as to the carriage and the possible dinner in the\r\nMajor\'s bedroom, to make the man understand almost exactly what had\r\noccurred. A note from the Major was brought to the Duke while he was\r\ndressing. The Duke having glanced at the note threw it into the fire;\r\nand the Major that evening eat his dinner at the Palliser Arms Inn at\r\nSilverbridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nThe Duchess Is Much Troubled\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible that one man should turn another out of his\r\nhouse without many people knowing it; and when the one person is a\r\nPrime Minister and the other such a Major as Major Pountney, the\r\naffair is apt to be talked about very widely. The Duke of course\r\nnever opened his mouth on the subject, except in answer to questions\r\nfrom the Duchess; but all the servants knew it. "Pritchard tells me\r\nthat you have sent that wretched man out of the house with a flea in\r\nhis ear," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"I sent him out of the house, certainly."\r\n\r\n"He was hardly worth your anger."\r\n\r\n"He is not at all worth my anger;--but I could not sit down to dinner\r\nwith a man who had insulted me."\r\n\r\n"What did he say, Plantagenet? I know it was something about\r\nSilverbridge." To this question the Duke gave no answer, but in\r\nrespect to Silverbridge he was stern as adamant. Two days after the\r\ndeparture of the Major it was known to Silverbridge generally that in\r\nthe event of there being an election the Duke\'s agent would not as\r\nusual suggest a nominee. There was a paragraph on the subject in the\r\nCounty paper, and another in the London "Evening Pulpit." The Duke of\r\nOmnium,--that he might show his respect to the law, not only as to\r\nthe letter of the law, but as to the spirit also,--had made it known\r\nto his tenantry in and round Silverbridge generally that he would\r\nin no way influence their choice of a candidate in the event of\r\nan election. But these newspapers did not say a word about Major\r\nPountney.\r\n\r\nThe clubs of course knew all about it, and no man at any club ever\r\nknew more than Captain Gunner. Soon after Christmas he met his friend\r\nthe Major on the steps of the new military club, The Active Service,\r\nwhich was declared by many men in the army to have left all the other\r\nmilitary clubs "absolutely nowhere." "Halloa, Punt!" he said, "you\r\nseem to have made a mess of it at last down at the Duchess\'s."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what you know about it."\r\n\r\n"You had to come away pretty quick, I take it."\r\n\r\n"Of course I came away pretty quick." So much as that the Major was\r\naware must be known. There were details which he could deny safely,\r\nas it would be impossible that they should be supported by evidence,\r\nbut there were matters which must be admitted. "I\'ll bet a fiver that\r\nbeyond that you know nothing about it."\r\n\r\n"The Duke ordered you off, I take it."\r\n\r\n"After a fashion he did. There are circumstances in which a man\r\ncannot help himself." This was diplomatical, because it left the\r\nCaptain to suppose that the Duke was the man who could not help\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Of course I was not there," said Gunner, "and I can\'t absolutely\r\nknow, but I suppose you had been interfering with the Duchess about\r\nSilverbridge. Glencora will bear a great deal,--but since she has\r\ntaken up politics, by George, you had better not touch her there." At\r\nlast it came to be believed that the Major had been turned out by the\r\norder of the Duchess, because he had ventured to put himself forward\r\nas an opponent to Ferdinand Lopez, and the Major felt himself really\r\ngrateful to his friend the Captain for this arrangement of the\r\nstory. And there came at last to be mixed up with the story some\r\nhalf-understood innuendo that the Major\'s jealousy against Lopez\r\nhad been of a double nature,--in reference both to the Duchess and\r\nthe borough,--so that he escaped from much of that disgrace which\r\nnaturally attaches itself to a man who has been kicked out of another\r\nman\'s house. There was a mystery;--and when there is a mystery a man\r\nshould never be condemned. Where there is a woman in the case a man\r\ncannot be expected to tell the truth. As for calling out or in any\r\nway punishing the Prime Minister, that of course was out of the\r\nquestion. And so it went on till at last the Major was almost proud\r\nof what he had done, and talked about it willingly with mysterious\r\nhints, in which practice made him perfect.\r\n\r\nBut with the Duchess the affair was very serious, so much so that\r\nshe was driven to call in advice,--not only from her constant friend,\r\nMrs. Finn, but afterwards from Barrington Erle, from Phineas Finn,\r\nand lastly even from the Duke of St. Bungay, to whom she was hardly\r\nwilling to subject herself, the Duke being the special friend of\r\nher husband. But the matter became so important to her that she was\r\nunable to trifle with it. At Gatherum the expulsion of Major Pountney\r\nsoon became a forgotten affair. When the Duchess learned the truth\r\nshe quite approved of the expulsion, only hinting to Barrington\r\nErle that the act of kicking out should have been more absolutely\r\npractical. And the loss of Silverbridge, though it hurt her sorely,\r\ncould be endured. She must write to her friend Ferdinand Lopez, when\r\nthe time should come, excusing herself as best she might, and must\r\nlose the exquisite delight of making a Member of Parliament out of\r\nher own hand. The newspapers, however, had taken that matter up in\r\nthe proper spirit, and political capital might to some extent be\r\nmade of it. The loss of Silverbridge, though it bruised, broke\r\nno bones. But the Duke had again expressed himself with unusual\r\nsternness respecting her ducal hospitalities, and had reiterated the\r\ndeclaration of his intention to live out the remainder of his period\r\nof office in republican simplicity. "We have tried it and it has\r\nfailed, and let there be an end of it," he said to her. Simple and\r\ndirect disobedience to such an order was as little in her way as\r\nsimple or direct obedience. She knew her husband well, and knew how\r\nhe could be managed and how he could not be managed. When he declared\r\nthat there should be an "end of it,"--meaning an end of the very\r\nsystem by which she hoped to perpetuate his power,--she did not dare\r\nto argue with him. And yet he was so wrong! The trial had been no\r\nfailure. The thing had been done and well done, and had succeeded.\r\nWas failure to be presumed because one impertinent puppy had found\r\nhis way into the house? And then to abandon the system at once,\r\nwhether it had failed or whether it had succeeded, would be to call\r\nthe attention of all the world to an acknowledged failure,--to a\r\nfailure so disreputable that its acknowledgment must lead to the\r\nloss of everything! It was known now,--so argued the Duchess to\r\nherself,--that she had devoted herself to the work of cementing and\r\nconsolidating the Coalition by the graceful hospitality which the\r\nwealth of herself and her husband enabled her to dispense. She had\r\nmade herself a Prime Ministress by the manner in which she opened\r\nher saloons, her banqueting halls, and her gardens. It had never\r\nbeen done before, and now it had been well done. There had been no\r\nfailure. And yet everything was to be broken down because his nerves\r\nhad received a shock!\r\n\r\n"Let it die out," Mrs. Finn had said. "The people will come here and\r\nwill go away, and then, when you are up in London, you will soon fall\r\ninto your old ways." But this did not suit the new ambition of the\r\nDuchess. She had so fed her mind with daring hopes that she could not\r\nbear that it should "die out." She had arranged a course of things in\r\nher own mind by which she should come to be known as the great Prime\r\nMinister\'s wife; and she had, perhaps unconsciously, applied the\r\nepithet more to herself than to her husband. She, too, wished to be\r\nwritten of in memoirs, and to make a niche for herself in history.\r\nAnd now she was told that she was to let it "die out!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he is a little bilious," Barrington Erle had said. "Don\'t\r\nyou think he\'ll forget all about it when he gets up to London?" The\r\nDuchess was sure that her husband would not forget anything. He never\r\ndid forget anything. "I want him to be told," said the Duchess, "that\r\neverybody thinks that he is doing very well. I don\'t mean about\r\npolitics exactly, but as to keeping the party together. Don\'t you\r\nthink that we have succeeded?" Barrington Erle thought that upon the\r\nwhole they had succeeded; but suggested at the same time that there\r\nwere seeds of weakness. "Sir Orlando and Sir Timothy Beeswax are not\r\nsound, you know," said Barrington Erle. "He can\'t make them sounder\r\nby shutting himself up like a hermit," said the Duchess. Barrington\r\nErle, who had peculiar privileges of his own, promised that if he\r\ncould by any means make an occasion, he would let the Duke know that\r\ntheir side of the Coalition was more than contented with the way in\r\nwhich he did his work.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think we\'ve made a mess of it?" she said to Phineas,\r\nasking him a question. "I don\'t think that the Duke has made a mess\r\nof it,--or you," said Phineas, who had come to love the Duchess\r\nbecause his wife loved her. "But it won\'t go on for ever, Duchess."\r\n"You know what I\'ve done," said the Duchess, who took it for granted\r\nthat Mr. Finn knew all that his wife knew. "Has it answered?" Phineas\r\nwas silent for a moment. "Of course you will tell me the truth. You\r\nwon\'t be so bad as to flatter me now that I am so much in earnest."\r\n"I almost think," said Phineas, "that the time has gone by for what\r\none may call drawing-room influences. They used to be very great.\r\nOld Lord Brock used them extensively, though by no means as your\r\nGrace has done. But the spirit of the world has changed since then."\r\n"The spirit of the world never changes," said the Duchess, in her\r\nsoreness.\r\n\r\nBut her strongest dependence was on the old Duke. The party at the\r\nCastle was almost broken up when she consulted him. She had been so\r\nfar true to her husband as not to ask another guest to the house\r\nsince his command;--but they who had been asked before came and went\r\nas had been arranged. Then, when the place was nearly empty, and when\r\nLocock and Millepois and Pritchard were wondering among themselves at\r\nthis general collapse, she asked her husband\'s leave to invite their\r\nold friend again for a day or two. "I do so want to see him, and I\r\nthink he\'ll come," said the Duchess. The Duke gave his permission\r\nwith a ready smile,--not because the proposed visitor was his own\r\nconfidential friend, but because it suited his spirit to grant such\r\na request as to any one after the order that he had given. Had she\r\nnamed Major Pountney, I think he would have smiled and acceded.\r\n\r\nThe Duke came, and to him she poured out her whole soul. "It has\r\nbeen for him and for his honour that I have done it;--that men and\r\nwomen might know how really gracious he is, and how good. Of course,\r\nthere has been money spent, but he can afford it without hurting\r\nthe children. It has been so necessary that with a Coalition people\r\nshould know each other! There was some little absurd row here. A man\r\nwho was a mere nobody, one of the travelling butterfly men that fill\r\nup spaces and talk to girls, got hold of him and was impertinent. He\r\nis so thin-skinned that he could not shake the creature into the dust\r\nas you would have done. It annoyed him,--that, and, I think, seeing\r\nso many strange faces,--so that he came to me and declared, that as\r\nlong as he remained in office he would not have another person in the\r\nhouse, either here or in London. He meant it literally, and he meant\r\nme to understand it literally. I had to get special leave before I\r\ncould ask so dear an old friend as your Grace."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he would object to me," said the Duke, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Of course not. He was only too glad to think you would come. But\r\nhe took the request as being quite the proper thing. It will kill me\r\nif this is to be carried out. After all that I have done, I could\r\nshow myself nowhere. And it will be so injurious to him! Could not\r\nyou tell him, Duke? No one else in the world can tell him but you.\r\nNothing unfair has been attempted. No job has been done. I have\r\nendeavoured to make his house pleasant to people, in order that they\r\nmight look upon him with grace and favour. Is that wrong? Is that\r\nunbecoming a wife?"\r\n\r\nThe old Duke patted her on the head as though she were a little girl,\r\nand was more comforting to her than her other counsellors. He would\r\nsay nothing to her husband now;--but they must both be up in London\r\nat the meeting of Parliament, and then he would tell his friend that,\r\nin his opinion, no sudden change should be made. "This husband of\r\nyours is a very peculiar man," he said, smiling. "His honesty is not\r\nlike the honesty of other men. It is more downright;--more absolutely\r\nhonest; less capable of bearing even the shadow which the stain from\r\nanother\'s dishonesty might throw upon it. Give him credit for all\r\nthat, and remember that you cannot find everything combined in the\r\nsame person. He is very practical in some things, but the question\r\nis, whether he is not too scrupulous to be practical in all things."\r\nAt the close of the interview the Duchess kissed him and promised to\r\nbe guided by him. The occurrences of the last few weeks had softened\r\nthe Duchess much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nThe Two Candidates for Silverbridge\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in London Ferdinand Lopez found a letter waiting for\r\nhim from the Duchess. This came into his hand immediately on his\r\nreaching the rooms in Belgrave Mansions, and was of course the first\r\nobject of his care. "That contains my fate," he said to his wife,\r\nputting his hand down upon the letter. He had talked to her much of\r\nthe chance that had come in his way, and had shown himself to be very\r\nambitious of the honour offered to him. She of course had sympathised\r\nwith him, and was willing to think all good things both of the\r\nDuchess and of the Duke, if they would between them put her husband\r\ninto Parliament. He paused a moment, still holding the letter under\r\nhis hand. "You would hardly think that I should be such a coward that\r\nI don\'t like to open it," he said.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to do it."\r\n\r\n"Unless I make you do it for me," he said, holding out the letter to\r\nher. "You will have to learn how weak I am. When I am really anxious\r\nI become like a child."\r\n\r\n"I do not think you are ever weak," she said, caressing him. "If\r\nthere were a thing to be done you would do it at once. But I\'ll open\r\nit if you like." Then he tore off the envelope with an air of comic\r\nimportance and stood for a few minutes while he read it.\r\n\r\n"What I first perceive is that there has been a row about it," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"A row about it! What sort of a row?"\r\n\r\n"My dear friend the Duchess has not quite hit it off with my less\r\ndear friend the Duke."\r\n\r\n"She does not say so?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no! My friend the Duchess is much too discreet for\r\nthat;--but I can see that it has been so."\r\n\r\n"Are you to be the new member? If that is arranged I don\'t care a bit\r\nabout the Duke and Duchess."\r\n\r\n"These things do not settle themselves quite so easily as that. I am\r\nnot to have the seat at any rate without fighting for it. There\'s the\r\nletter."\r\n\r\nThe Duchess\'s letter to her new adherent shall be given, but it must\r\nfirst be understood that many different ideas had passed through the\r\nwriter\'s mind between the writing of the letter and the order given\r\nby the Prime Minister to his wife concerning the borough. She of\r\ncourse became aware at once that Mr. Lopez must be informed that she\r\ncould not do for him what she had suggested that she would do. But\r\nthere was no necessity of writing at the instant. Mr. Grey had not\r\nyet vacated the seat, and Mr. Lopez was away on his travels. The\r\nmonth of January was passed in comparative quiet at the Castle, and\r\nduring that time it became known at Silverbridge that the election\r\nwould be open. The Duke would not even make a suggestion, and would\r\nneither express, nor feel, resentment should a member be returned\r\naltogether hostile to his Ministry. By degrees the Duchess accustomed\r\nherself to this condition of affairs, and as the consternation caused\r\nby her husband\'s very imperious conduct wore off, she began to ask\r\nherself whether even yet she need quite give up the game. She could\r\nnot make a Member of Parliament altogether out of her own hand,\r\nas she had once fondly hoped she might do; but still she might do\r\nsomething. She would in nothing disobey her husband, but if Mr.\r\nLopez were to stand for Silverbridge, it could not but be known in\r\nthe borough that Mr. Lopez was her friend. Therefore she wrote the\r\nfollowing letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Gatherum, -- January, 18--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. LOPEZ,\r\n\r\n   I remember that you said that you would be home at this\r\n   time, and therefore I write to you about the borough.\r\n   Things are changed since you went away, and, I fear, not\r\n   changed for your advantage.\r\n\r\n   We understand that Mr. Grey will apply for the Chiltern\r\n   Hundreds at the end of March, and that the election will\r\n   take place in April. No candidate will appear as favoured\r\n   from hence. We used to run a favourite, and our favourite\r\n   would sometimes win,--would sometimes even have a walk\r\n   over; but those good times are gone. All the good times\r\n   are going, I think. There is no reason that I know why you\r\n   should not stand as well as any one else. You can be early\r\n   in the field;--because it is only now known that there\r\n   will be no Gatherum interest. And I fancy it has already\r\n   leaked out that you would have been the favourite if there\r\n   had been a favourite;--which might be beneficial.\r\n\r\n   I need hardly say that I do not wish my name to be\r\n   mentioned in the matter.\r\n\r\n   Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n   GLENCORA OMNIUM.\r\n\r\n   Sprugeon, the ironmonger, would, I do not doubt, be proud\r\n   to nominate you.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand much about it," said Emily.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not. It is not meant that any novice should understand\r\nmuch about it. Of course you will not mention her Grace\'s letter."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"She intends to do the very best she can for me. I have no doubt that\r\nsome understrapper from the Castle has had some communication with\r\nMr. Sprugeon. The fact is that the Duke won\'t be seen in it, but that\r\nthe Duchess does not mean that the borough shall quite slip through\r\ntheir fingers."\r\n\r\n"Shall you try it?"\r\n\r\n"If I do I must send an agent down to see Mr. Sprugeon on the sly,\r\nand the sooner I do so the better. I wonder what your father will say\r\nabout it?"\r\n\r\n"He is an old Conservative."\r\n\r\n"But would he not like his son-in-law to be in Parliament?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he would care about it very much. He seems always\r\nto laugh at people who want to get into Parliament. But if you have\r\nset your heart upon it, Ferdinand--"\r\n\r\n"I have not set my heart on spending a great deal of money. When I\r\nfirst thought of Silverbridge the expense would have been almost\r\nnothing. It would have been a walk over, as the Duchess calls it. But\r\nnow there will certainly be a contest."\r\n\r\n"Give it up if you cannot afford it."\r\n\r\n"Nothing venture nothing have. You don\'t think your father would help\r\nme in doing it? It would add almost as much to your position as to\r\nmine." Emily shook her head. She had always heard her father ridicule\r\nthe folly of men who spent more than they could afford in the vanity\r\nof writing two letters after their name, and she now explained that\r\nit had always been so with him. "You would not mind asking him," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I will ask him if you wish it, certainly." Ever since their marriage\r\nhe had been teaching her,--intentionally teaching her,--that it would\r\nbe the duty of both of them to get all they could from her father.\r\nShe had learned the lesson, but it had been very distasteful to her.\r\nIt had not induced her to think ill of her husband. She was too much\r\nengrossed with him, too much in love with him for that. But she was\r\nbeginning to feel that the world in general was hard and greedy\r\nand uncomfortable. If it was proper that a father should give his\r\ndaughter money when she was married, why did not her father do so\r\nwithout waiting to be asked? And yet, if he were unwilling to do so,\r\nwould it not be better to leave him to his pleasure in the matter?\r\nBut now she began to perceive that her father was to be regarded as\r\na milch cow, and that she was to be the dairy-maid. Her husband at\r\ntimes would become terribly anxious on the subject. On receiving\r\nthe promise of L3000 he had been elated, but since that he had\r\ncontinually talked of what more her father ought to do for them.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I had better take the bull by the horns," he said, "and do\r\nit myself. Then I shall find out whether he really has our interest\r\nat heart, or whether he looks on you as a stranger because you\'ve\r\ngone away from him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he will look upon me as a stranger."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see," said Lopez.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before he made the experiment. He had called himself\r\na coward as to the opening of the Duchess\'s letter, but he had\r\nin truth always courage for perils of this nature. On the day of\r\ntheir arrival they dined with Mr. Wharton in Manchester Square, and\r\ncertainly the old man had received his daughter with great delight.\r\nHe had been courteous also to Lopez, and Emily, amidst the pleasure\r\nof his welcome, had forgotten some of her troubles. The three were\r\nalone together, and when Emily had asked after her brother, Mr.\r\nWharton had laughed and said that Everett was an ass. "You have not\r\nquarrelled with him?" she said. He ridiculed the idea of any quarrel,\r\nbut again said that Everett was an ass.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Mr. Wharton and Lopez were left together, as the old\r\nman, whether alone or in company, always sat for an hour sipping\r\nport wine after the manner of his forefathers. Lopez had already\r\ndetermined that he would not let the opportunity escape him, and\r\nbegan his attack at once. "I have been invited, sir," he said with\r\nhis sweetest smile, "to stand for Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"You too!" said Mr. Wharton. But, though there was a certain amount\r\nof satire in the exclamation, it had been good-humoured satire.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. We all get bit sooner or later, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I never was bit."\r\n\r\n"Your sagacity and philosophy have been the wonder of the world, sir.\r\nThere can be no doubt that in my profession a seat in the House would\r\nbe of the greatest possible advantage to me. It enables a man to do a\r\ngreat many things which he could not touch without it."\r\n\r\n"It may be so. I don\'t know anything about it."\r\n\r\n"And then it is a great honour."\r\n\r\n"That depends on how you get it, and how you use it;--very much also\r\non whether you are fit for it."\r\n\r\n"I shall get it honestly if I do get it. I hope I may use it well.\r\nAnd as for my fitness, I must leave that to be ascertained when I am\r\nthere. I am sorry to say there will probably be a contest."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. A seat in Parliament without a contest does not drop\r\ninto every young man\'s mouth."\r\n\r\n"It very nearly dropped into mine." Then he told his father-in-law\r\nalmost all the particulars of the offer which had been made him,\r\nand of the manner in which the seat was now suggested to him. He\r\nsomewhat hesitated in the use of the name of the Duchess, leaving an\r\nimpression on Mr. Wharton that the offer had in truth come from the\r\nDuke. "Should there be a contest, would you help me?"\r\n\r\n"In what way? I could not canvass at Silverbridge, if you mean that."\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of giving you personal trouble."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know a soul in the place. I shouldn\'t know that there was\r\nsuch a place except that it returns a member of Parliament."\r\n\r\n"I meant with money, sir."\r\n\r\n"To pay the election bills! No; certainly not. Why should I?"\r\n\r\n"For Emily\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it would do Emily any good, or you either. It would\r\ncertainly do me none. It is a kind of luxury that a man should not\r\nattempt to enjoy unless he can afford it easily."\r\n\r\n"A luxury!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a luxury; just as much as a four-in-hand coach or a yacht.\r\nMen go into Parliament because it gives them fashion, position, and\r\npower."\r\n\r\n"I should go to serve my country."\r\n\r\n"Success in your profession I thought you said was your object. Of\r\ncourse you must do as you please. If you ask me for advice, I advise\r\nyou not to try it. But certainly I will not help you with money. That\r\nass Everett is quarrelling with me at this moment because I won\'t\r\ngive him money to go and stand somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Not at Silverbridge!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I can\'t say. But don\'t let me do him an injury. To give him\r\nhis due, he is more reasonable than you, and only wants a promise\r\nfrom me that I will pay electioneering bills for him at the next\r\ngeneral election. I have refused him,--though for reasons which I\r\nneed not mention I think him better fitted for Parliament than you.\r\nI must certainly also refuse you. I cannot imagine any circumstances\r\nwhich would induce me to pay a shilling towards getting you into\r\nParliament. If you won\'t drink any more wine, we\'ll join Emily\r\nupstairs."\r\n\r\nThis had been very plain speaking, and by no means comfortable to\r\nLopez. What of personal discourtesy there had been in the lawyer\'s\r\nwords,--and they had not certainly been flattering,--he could throw\r\noff from him as meaning nothing. As he could not afford to quarrel\r\nwith his father-in-law, he thought it probable that he might\r\nhave to bear a good deal of incivility from the old man. He was\r\nquite prepared to bear it as long as he could see a chance of a\r\nreward;--though, should there be no such chance, he would be ready to\r\navenge it. But there had been a decision in the present refusal which\r\nmade him quite sure that it would be vain to repeat his request. "I\r\nshall find out, sir," he said, "whether it may probably be a costly\r\naffair, and if so I shall give it up. You are rather hard upon me as\r\nto my motives."\r\n\r\n"I only repeated what you told me yourself."\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure of my own intentions, and know that I need not be\r\nashamed of them."\r\n\r\n"Not if you have plenty of money. It all depends on that. If you have\r\nplenty of money, and your fancy goes that way, it is all very well.\r\nCome, we\'ll go upstairs."\r\n\r\nThe next day he saw Everett Wharton, who welcomed him back with warm\r\naffection. "He\'ll do nothing for me;--nothing at all. I am almost\r\nbeginning to doubt whether he\'ll ever speak to me again."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you everything, you know," said Everett. "In January I lost\r\na little money at whist. They got plunging at the club, and I was in\r\nit. I had to tell him, of course. He keeps me so short that I can\'t\r\nstand any blow without going to him like a school-boy."\r\n\r\n"Was it much?"\r\n\r\n"No;--to him no more than half-a-crown to you. I had to ask him for a\r\nhundred and fifty."\r\n\r\n"He refused it!"\r\n\r\n"No;--he didn\'t do that. Had it been ten times as much, if I owed\r\nthe money, he would pay it. But he blew me up, and talked about\r\ngambling,--and--and--"\r\n\r\n"I should have taken that as a matter of course."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m not a gambler. A man now and then may fall into a thing of\r\nthat kind, and if he\'s decently well off and don\'t do it often, he\r\ncan bear it."\r\n\r\n"I thought your quarrel had been altogether about Parliament."\r\n\r\n"Oh no! He has been always the same about that. He told me that I\r\nwas going head foremost to the dogs, and I couldn\'t stand that. I\r\nshouldn\'t be surprised if he hasn\'t lost more at cards than I have\r\nduring the last two years." Lopez made an offer to act as go-between,\r\nto effect a reconciliation; but Everett declined the offer. "It would\r\nbe making too much of an absurdity," he said. "When he wants to see\r\nme, I suppose he\'ll send for me."\r\n\r\nLopez did dispatch an agent down to Mr. Sprugeon at Silverbridge,\r\nand the agent found that Mr. Sprugeon was a very discreet man. Mr.\r\nSprugeon at first knew little or nothing,--seemed hardly to be aware\r\nthat there was a member of Parliament for Silverbridge, and declared\r\nhimself to be indifferent as to the parliamentary character of the\r\nborough. But at last he melted a little, and by degrees, over a\r\nglass of hot brandy-and-water with the agent at the Palliser Arms,\r\nconfessed to a shade of an opinion that the return of Mr. Lopez for\r\nthe borough would not be disagreeable to some person or persons who\r\ndid not live quite a hundred miles away. The instructions given by\r\nLopez to his agent were of the most cautious kind. The agent was\r\nmerely to feel the ground, make a few inquiries, and do nothing. His\r\nclient did not intend to stand unless he could see the way to almost\r\ncertain success with very little outlay. But the agent, perhaps\r\nliking the job, did a little outstep his employer\'s orders. Mr.\r\nSprugeon, when the frost of his first modesty had been thawed,\r\nintroduced the agent to Mr. Sprout, the maker of cork soles, and\r\nMr. Sprugeon and Mr. Sprout between them had soon decided that\r\nMr. Ferdinand Lopez should be run for the borough as the "Castle"\r\ncandidate. "The Duke won\'t interfere," said Sprugeon; "and, of\r\ncourse, the Duke\'s man of business can\'t do anything openly;--but\r\nthe Duke\'s people will know." Then Mr. Sprout told the agent that\r\nthere was already another candidate in the field, and in a whisper\r\ncommunicated the gentleman\'s name. When the agent got back to London,\r\nhe gave Lopez to understand that he must certainly put himself\r\nforward. The borough expected him. Sprugeon and Sprout considered\r\nthemselves pledged to bring him forward and support him,--on behalf\r\nof the Castle. Sprugeon was quite sure that the Castle influence\r\nwas predominant. The Duke\'s name had never been mentioned at\r\nSilverbridge,--hardly even that of the Duchess. Since the Duke\'s\r\ndeclaration "The Castle" had taken the part which the old Duke\r\nused to play. The agent was quite sure that no one could get in\r\nfor Silverbridge without having the Castle on his side. No doubt\r\nthe Duke\'s declaration had had the ill effect of bringing up\r\na competitor, and thus of causing expense. That could not now\r\nbe helped. The agent was of opinion that the Duke had had no\r\nalternative. The agent hinted that times were changing, and that\r\nthough dukes were still dukes, and could still exercise ducal\r\ninfluences, they were driven by these changes to act in an altered\r\nform. The proclamation had been especially necessary because the Duke\r\nwas Prime Minister. The agent did not think that Mr. Lopez should\r\nbe in the least angry with the Duke. Everything would be done that\r\nthe Castle could do, and Lopez would be no doubt returned,--though,\r\nunfortunately, not without some expense. How much would it cost? Any\r\naccurate answer to such a question would be impossible, but probably\r\nabout L600. It might be L800;--could not possibly be above L1000.\r\nLopez winced as he heard these sums named, but he did not decline the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nThen the name of the opposition candidate was whispered to Lopez. It\r\nwas Arthur Fletcher! Lopez started, and asked some questions as to\r\nMr. Fletcher\'s interest in the neighbourhood. The Fletchers were\r\nconnected with the De Courcys, and as soon as the declaration of the\r\nDuke had been made known, the De Courcy interest had aroused itself,\r\nand had invited that rising young barrister, Arthur Fletcher, to\r\nstand for the borough on strictly conservative views. Arthur Fletcher\r\nhad acceded, and a printed declaration of his purpose and political\r\nprinciples had been just published. "I have beaten him once," said\r\nLopez to himself, "and I think I can beat him again."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n"Yes;--a Lie!"\r\n\r\n\r\n"So you went to Happerton after all," said Lopez to his ally, Mr.\r\nSextus Parker. "You couldn\'t believe me when I told you the money was\r\nall right! What a cur you are!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right;--abuse me."\r\n\r\n"Well, it was horrid. Didn\'t I tell you that it must necessarily\r\ninjure me with the house? How are two fellows to get on together\r\nunless they can put some trust in each other? Even if I did run you\r\ninto a difficulty, do you really think I\'m ruffian enough to tell you\r\nthat the money was there if it were untrue?"\r\n\r\nSexty looked like a cur and felt like a cur, as he was being thus\r\nabused. He was not angry with his friend for calling him bad names,\r\nbut only anxious to excuse himself. "I was out of sorts," he said,\r\n"and so d----d hippish I didn\'t know what I was about."\r\n\r\n"Brandy-and-soda!" suggested Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps a little of that;--though, by Jove, it isn\'t often I do that\r\nkind of thing. I don\'t know a fellow who works harder for his wife\r\nand children than I do. But when one sees such things all round\r\none,--a fellow utterly smashed here who had a string of hunters\r\nyesterday, and another fellow buying a house in Piccadilly and\r\npulling it down because it isn\'t big enough, who was contented with a\r\nlittle box at Hornsey last summer, one doesn\'t quite know how to keep\r\none\'s legs."\r\n\r\n"If you want to learn a lesson look at the two men, and see where the\r\ndifference lies. The one has had some heart about him, and the other\r\nhas been a coward."\r\n\r\nParker scratched his head, balanced himself on the hind legs of\r\nhis stool, and tacitly acknowledged the truth of all that his\r\nenterprising friend said to him. "Has old Wharton come down well?" at\r\nlast he asked.\r\n\r\n"I have never said a word to old Wharton about money," Lopez\r\nreplied,--"except as to the cost of this election I was telling you\r\nof."\r\n\r\n"And he wouldn\'t do anything in that?"\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t approve of the thing itself. I don\'t doubt but that the\r\nold gentleman and I shall understand each other before long."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got the length of his foot."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t mean to drive him. I can get along without that. He\'s an\r\nold man, and he can\'t take his money along with him when he goes the\r\ngreat journey."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a brother, Lopez,--isn\'t there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--there\'s a brother; but Wharton has enough for two; and if he\r\nwere to put either out of his will it wouldn\'t be my wife. Old men\r\ndon\'t like parting with their money, and he\'s like other old men.\r\nIf it were not so I shouldn\'t bother myself coming into the city at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Has he enough for that, Lopez?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'s worth a quarter of a million."\r\n\r\n"By Jove! And where did he get it?"\r\n\r\n"Perseverance, sir. Put by a shilling a day, and let it have its\r\nnatural increase, and see what it will come to at the end of fifty\r\nyears. I suppose old Wharton has been putting by two or three\r\nthousand out of his professional income, at any rate for the last\r\nthirty years, and never for a moment forgetting its natural increase.\r\nThat\'s one way to make a fortune."\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t rapid enough for you and me, Lopez."\r\n\r\n"No. That was the old-fashioned way, and the most sure. But, as\r\nyou say, it is not rapid enough; and it robs a man of the power of\r\nenjoying his money when he has made it. But it\'s a very good thing\r\nto be closely connected with a man who has already done that kind of\r\nthing. There\'s no doubt about the money when it is there. It does not\r\ntake to itself wings and fly away."\r\n\r\n"But the man who has it sticks to it uncommon hard."\r\n\r\n"Of course he does;--but he can\'t take it away with him."\r\n\r\n"He can leave it to hospitals, Lopez. That\'s the devil!"\r\n\r\n"Sexty, my boy, I see you have taken an outlook into human life which\r\ndoes you credit. Yes, he can leave it to hospitals. But why does he\r\nleave it to hospitals?"\r\n\r\n"Something of being afraid about his soul, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t believe in that. Such a man as this, who has been\r\nhard-fisted all his life, and who has had his eyes thoroughly open,\r\nwho has made his own money in the sharp intercourse of man to man,\r\nand who keeps it to the last gasp,--he doesn\'t believe that he\'ll do\r\nhis soul any good by giving it to hospitals when he can\'t keep it\r\nhimself any longer. His mind has freed itself from those cobwebs long\r\nsince. He gives his money to hospitals because the last pleasure of\r\nwhich he is capable is that of spiting his relations. And it is a\r\ngreat pleasure to an old man, when his relations have been disgusted\r\nwith him for being old and loving his money. I rather think I should\r\ndo it myself."\r\n\r\n"I\'d give myself a chance of going to heaven, I think," said Parker.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know that men will rob and cheat on their death-beds, and\r\nsay their prayers all the time? Old Wharton won\'t leave his money to\r\nhospitals if he\'s well handled by those about him."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll handle him well;--eh, Lopez?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t quarrel with him, or tell him that he\'s a curmudgeon because\r\nhe doesn\'t do all that I want him. He\'s over seventy, and he can\'t\r\ncarry his money with him."\r\n\r\nAll this left so vivid an impression of the wisdom of his friend on\r\nthe mind of Sextus Parker, that in spite of the harrowing fears by\r\nwhich he had been tormented on more than one occasion already, he\r\nallowed himself to be persuaded into certain fiscal arrangements, by\r\nwhich Lopez would find himself put at ease with reference to money at\r\nany rate for the next four months. He had at once told himself that\r\nthis election would cost him L1000. When various sums were mentioned\r\nin reference to such an affair, safety could alone be found in taking\r\nthe outside sum;--perhaps might generally be more surely found by\r\nadding fifty per cent. to that. He knew that he was wrong about the\r\nelection, but he assured himself that he had had no alternative. The\r\nmisfortune had been that the Duke should have made his proclamation\r\nabout the borough immediately after the offer made by the Duchess. He\r\nhad been almost forced to send the agent down to inquire;--and the\r\nagent, when making his inquiries, had compromised him. He must go\r\non with it now. Perhaps some idea of the pleasantness of increased\r\nintimacy with the Duchess of Omnium encouraged him in this way of\r\nthinking. The Duchess was up in town in February, and Lopez left a\r\ncard in Carlton Terrace. On the very next day the card of the Duchess\r\nwas left for Mrs. Lopez at the Belgrave Mansions.\r\n\r\nLopez went into the city every day, leaving home at about eleven\r\no\'clock, and not returning much before dinner. The young wife at\r\nfirst found that she hardly knew what to do with her time. Her aunt,\r\nMrs. Roby, was distasteful to her. She had already learned from her\r\nhusband that he had but little respect for Mrs. Roby. "You remember\r\nthe sapphire brooch," he had said once. "That was part of the price I\r\nhad to pay for being allowed to approach you." He was sitting at the\r\ntime with his arm round her waist, looking out on beautiful scenery\r\nand talking of his old difficulties. She could not find it in her\r\nheart to be angry with him, but the idea brought to her mind was\r\ndisagreeable to her. And she was thoroughly angry with Mrs. Roby. Of\r\ncourse in these days Mrs. Roby came to see her, and of course when\r\nshe was up in Manchester Square, she went to the house round the\r\ncorner,--but there was no close intimacy between the aunt and the\r\nniece. And many of her father\'s friends,--whom she regarded as the\r\nHerefordshire set,--were very cold to her. She had not made herself a\r\nglory to Herefordshire, and,--as all these people said,--had broken\r\nthe heart of the best Herefordshire young man of the day. This made\r\na great falling-off in her acquaintance, which was the more felt as\r\nshe had never been, as a girl, devoted to a large circle of dearest\r\nfemale friends. She whom she had loved best had been Mary Wharton,\r\nand Mary Wharton had refused to be her bridesmaid almost without an\r\nexpression of regret. She saw her father occasionally. Once he came\r\nand dined with them at their rooms, on which occasion Lopez struggled\r\nhard to make up a well-sounding party. There were Roby from the\r\nAdmiralty, and the Happertons, and Sir Timothy Beeswax, with whom\r\nLopez had become acquainted at Gatherum, and old Lord Mongrober. But\r\nthe barrister, who had dined out a good deal in his time, perceived\r\nthe effort. Who, that ever with difficulty scraped his dinner\r\nguests together, was able afterwards to obliterate the signs of the\r\nstruggle? It was, however, a first attempt, and Lopez, whose courage\r\nwas good, thought that he might do better before long. If he could\r\nget into the House and make his mark there people then would dine\r\nwith him fast enough. But while this was going on Emily\'s life was\r\nrather dull. He had provided her with a brougham, and everything\r\naround her was even luxurious, but there came upon her gradually a\r\nfeeling that by her marriage she had divided herself from her own\r\npeople. She did not for a moment allow this feeling to interfere with\r\nher loyalty to him. Had she not known that this division would surely\r\ntake place? Had she not married him because she loved him better than\r\nher own people? So she sat herself down to read Dante,--for they had\r\nstudied Italian together during their honeymoon, and she had found\r\nthat he knew the language well. And she was busy with her needle. And\r\nshe already began to anticipate the happiness which would come to her\r\nwhen a child of his should be lying in her arms.\r\n\r\nShe was of course much interested about the election. Nothing could\r\nas yet be done, because as yet there was no vacancy; but still the\r\nsubject was discussed daily between them. "Who do you think is going\r\nto stand against me?" he said one day with a smile. "A very old\r\nfriend of yours." She knew at once who the man was, and the blood\r\ncame to her face. "I think he might as well have left it alone, you\r\nknow," he said.\r\n\r\n"Did he know?" she asked in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Know;--of course he knew. He is doing it on purpose. But I beat\r\nhim once, old girl, didn\'t I? And I\'ll beat him again." She liked\r\nhim to call her old girl. She loved the perfect intimacy with which\r\nhe treated her. But there was something which grated against her\r\nfeelings in this allusion by him to the other man who had loved her.\r\nOf course she had told him the whole story. She had conceived it to\r\nbe her duty to do so. But then the thing should have been over. It\r\nwas necessary, perhaps, that he should tell her who was his opponent.\r\nIt was impossible that she should not know when the fight came. But\r\nshe did not like to hear him boast that he had beaten Arthur Fletcher\r\nonce, and that he would beat him again. By doing so he likened the\r\nsweet fragrance of her love to the dirty turmoil of an electioneering\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nHe did not understand,--how should he?--that though she had never\r\nloved Arthur Fletcher, had never been able to bring herself to love\r\nhim when all her friends had wished it, her feelings to him were\r\nnevertheless those of affectionate friendship;--that she regarded him\r\nas being perfect in his way, a thorough gentleman, a man who would\r\nnot for worlds tell a lie, as most generous among the generous, most\r\nnoble among the noble. When the other Whartons had thrown her off, he\r\nhad not been cold to her. That very day, as soon as her husband had\r\nleft her, she looked again at that little note. "I am as I always\r\nhave been!" And she remembered that farewell down by the banks of the\r\nWye. "You will always have one,--one besides him,--who will love you\r\nbest in the world." They were dangerous words for her to remember;\r\nbut in recalling them to her memory she had often assured herself\r\nthat they should not be dangerous to her. She was too sure of her own\r\nheart to be afraid of danger. She had loved the one man and had not\r\nloved the other;--but yet, now, when her husband talked of beating\r\nthis man again, she could not but remember the words.\r\n\r\nShe did not think,--or rather had not thought,--that Arthur Fletcher\r\nwould willingly stand against her husband. It had occurred to her at\r\nonce that he must first have become a candidate without knowing who\r\nwould be his opponent. But Ferdinand had assured her as a matter of\r\nfact that Fletcher had known all about it. "I suppose in politics\r\nmen are different," she said to herself. Her husband had evidently\r\nsupposed that Arthur Fletcher had proposed himself as a candidate\r\nfor Silverbridge, with the express object of doing an injury to\r\nthe man who had carried off his love. And she repeated to herself\r\nher husband\'s words, "He is doing it on purpose." She did not like\r\nto differ from her husband, but she could hardly bring herself to\r\nbelieve that revenge of this kind should have recommended itself to\r\nArthur Fletcher.\r\n\r\nSome little time after this, when she had been settled in London\r\nabout a month, a letter was brought her, and she at once recognised\r\nArthur Fletcher\'s writing. She was alone at the time, and it occurred\r\nto her at first that perhaps she ought not to open any communication\r\nfrom him without showing it to her husband. But then it seemed that\r\nsuch a hesitation would imply a doubt of the man, and almost a doubt\r\nof herself. Why should she fear what any man might write to her? So\r\nshe opened the letter, and read it,--with infinite pleasure. It was\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MRS. LOPEZ,\r\n\r\n   I think it best to make an explanation to you as to a\r\n   certain coincidence which might possibly be misunderstood\r\n   unless explained. I find that your husband and I are to\r\n   be opponents at Silverbridge. I wish to say that I had\r\n   pledged myself to the borough before I had heard his name\r\n   as connected with it. I have very old associations with\r\n   the neighbourhood, and was invited to stand by friends\r\n   who had known me all my life as soon as it was understood\r\n   that there would be an open contest. I cannot retire now\r\n   without breaking faith with my party, nor do I know that\r\n   there is any reason why I should do so. I should not,\r\n   however, have come forward had I known that Mr. Lopez was\r\n   to stand. I think you had better tell him so, and tell\r\n   him also, with my compliments, that I hope we may fight\r\n   our political battle with mutual good-fellowship and\r\n   good-feeling.\r\n\r\n   Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n   ARTHUR FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily was very much pleased by this letter, and yet she wept over it.\r\nShe felt that she understood accurately all the motives that were\r\nat work within the man\'s breast when he was writing it. As to its\r\ntruth,--of course the letter was gospel to her. Oh,--if the man\r\ncould become her husband\'s friend how sweet it would be! Of course\r\nshe wished, thoroughly wished, that her husband should succeed at\r\nSilverbridge. But she could understand that such a contest as this\r\nmight be carried on without personal animosity. The letter was so\r\nlike Arthur Fletcher,--so good, so noble, so generous, so true! The\r\nmoment her husband came in she showed it to him with delight. "I was\r\nsure," she said as he was reading the letter, "that he had not known\r\nthat you were to stand."\r\n\r\n"He knew it as well as I did," he replied, and as he spoke there\r\ncame a dark scowl across his brow. "His writing to you is a piece of\r\ninfernal impudence."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ferdinand!"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand, but I do. He deserves to be horsewhipped for\r\ndaring to write to you, and if I can come across him he shall have\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Oh,--for heaven\'s sake!"\r\n\r\n"A man who was your rejected lover,--who has been trying to marry you\r\nfor the last two years, presuming to commence a correspondence with\r\nyou without your husband\'s sanction!"\r\n\r\n"He meant you to see it. He says I am to tell you."\r\n\r\n"Psha! That is simple cowardice. He meant you not to tell me; and\r\nthen when you had answered him without telling me, he would have had\r\nthe whip-hand of you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ferdinand, what evil thoughts you have!"\r\n\r\n"You are a child, my dear, and must allow me to dictate to you what\r\nyou ought to think in such a matter as this. I tell you he knew all\r\nabout my candidature, and that what he has said here to the contrary\r\nis a mere lie;--yes, a lie." He repeated the word because he saw\r\nthat she shrank at hearing it; but he did not understand why she\r\nshrank,--that the idea of such an accusation against Arthur Fletcher\r\nwas intolerable to her. "I have never heard of such a thing," he\r\ncontinued. "Do you suppose it is common for men who have been thrown\r\nover to write to the ladies who have rejected them immediately after\r\ntheir marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Do not the circumstances justify it?"\r\n\r\n"No;--they make it infinitely worse. He should have felt himself to\r\nbe debarred from writing to you, both as being my wife and as being\r\nthe wife of the man whom he intends to oppose at Silverbridge."\r\n\r\nThis he said with so much anger that he frightened her. "It is not my\r\nfault," she said.\r\n\r\n"No; it is not your fault. But you should regard it as a great fault\r\ncommitted by him."\r\n\r\n"What am I to do?"\r\n\r\n"Give me the letter. You, of course, can do nothing."\r\n\r\n"You will not quarrel with him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I will. I have quarrelled with him already. Do you think\r\nI will allow any man to insult my wife without quarrelling with him?\r\nWhat I shall do I cannot yet say, and whatever I may do, you had\r\nbetter not know. I never thought much of these Herefordshire swells\r\nwho believe themselves to be the very cream of the earth, and now I\r\nthink less of them than ever."\r\n\r\nHe was then silent, and slowly she took herself out of the room, and\r\nwent away to dress. All this was very terrible. He had never been\r\nrough to her before, and she could not at all understand why he had\r\nbeen so rough to her now. Surely it was impossible that he should\r\nbe jealous because her old lover had written to her such a letter\r\nas that which she had shown him! And then she was almost stunned by\r\nthe opinions he had expressed about Fletcher, opinions which she\r\nknew,--was sure that she knew,--to be absolutely erroneous. A liar!\r\nOh, heavens! And then the letter itself was so ingenuous and so\r\nhonest! Anxious as she was to do all that her husband bade her, she\r\ncould not be guided by him in this matter. And then she remembered\r\nhis words: "You must allow me to dictate to you what you ought to\r\nthink." Could it be that marriage meant as much as that,--that a\r\nhusband was to claim to dictate to his wife what opinions she was\r\nto form about this and that person,--about a person she had known\r\nso well, whom he had never known? Surely she could only think in\r\naccordance with her own experience and her own intelligence! She was\r\ncertain that Arthur Fletcher was no liar. Not even her own husband\r\ncould make her think that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n"Yes;--with a Horsewhip in My Hand"\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily Lopez, when she crept out of her own room and joined her\r\nhusband just before dinner, was hardly able to speak to him, so\r\nthoroughly was she dismayed, and troubled, and horrified, by the\r\nmanner in which he had taken Arthur Fletcher\'s letter. While she had\r\nbeen alone she had thought it all over, anxious if possible to bring\r\nherself into sympathy with her husband; but the more she thought\r\nof it the more evident did it become to her that he was altogether\r\nwrong. He was so wrong that it seemed to her that she would be a\r\nhypocrite if she pretended to agree with him. There were half-a-dozen\r\naccusations conveyed against Mr. Fletcher by her husband\'s view\r\nof the matter. He was a liar, giving a false account of his\r\ncandidature;--and he was a coward; and an enemy to her, who had laid\r\na plot by which he had hoped to make her act fraudulently towards her\r\nown husband, who had endeavoured to creep into a correspondence with\r\nher, and so to compromise her! All this, which her husband\'s mind had\r\nso easily conceived, was not only impossible to her, but so horrible\r\nthat she could not refrain from disgust at her husband\'s conception.\r\nThe letter had been left with him, but she remembered every word of\r\nit. She was sure that it was an honest letter, meaning no more than\r\nhad been said,--simply intending to explain to her that he would not\r\nwillingly have stood in the way of a friend whom he had loved, by\r\ninterfering with her husband\'s prospects. And yet she was told that\r\nshe was to think as her husband bade her think! She could not think\r\nso. She could not say that she thought so. If her husband would\r\nnot credit her judgment, let the matter be referred to her father.\r\nFerdinand would at any rate acknowledge that her father could\r\nunderstand such a matter even if she could not.\r\n\r\nDuring dinner he said nothing on the subject, nor did she. They were\r\nattended by a page in buttons whom he had hired to wait upon her,\r\nand the meal passed off almost in silence. She looked up at him\r\nfrequently and saw that his brow was still black. As soon as they\r\nwere alone she spoke to him, having studied during dinner what words\r\nshe would first say: "Are you going down to the club to-night?" He\r\nhad told her that the matter of this election had been taken up at\r\nthe Progress, and that possibly he might have to meet two or three\r\npersons there on this evening. There had been a proposition that\r\nthe club should bear a part of the expenditure, and he was very\r\nsolicitous that such an arrangement should be made.\r\n\r\n"No," said he, "I shall not go out to-night. I am not sufficiently\r\nlight-hearted."\r\n\r\n"What makes you heavy-hearted, Ferdinand?"\r\n\r\n"I should have thought you would have known."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I do know,--but I don\'t know why it should. I don\'t know\r\nwhy you should be displeased. At any rate, I have done nothing\r\nwrong."\r\n\r\n"No;--not as to the letter. But it astonishes me that you should be\r\nso--so bound to this man that--"\r\n\r\n"Bound to him, Ferdinand!"\r\n\r\n"No;--you are bound to me. But that you have so much regard for him\r\nas not to see that he has grossly insulted you."\r\n\r\n"I have a regard for him."\r\n\r\n"And you dare to tell me so?"\r\n\r\n"Dare! What should I be if I had any feeling which I did not dare to\r\ntell you? There is no harm in regarding a man with friendly feelings\r\nwhom I have known since I was a child, and whom all my family have\r\nloved."\r\n\r\n"Your family wanted you to marry him!"\r\n\r\n"They did. But I have married you, because I loved you. But I need\r\nnot think badly of an old friend, because I did not love him. Why\r\nshould you be angry with him? What can you have to be afraid of?"\r\nThen she came and sat on his knee and caressed him.\r\n\r\n"It is he that shall be afraid of me," said Lopez. "Let him give the\r\nborough up if he means what he says."\r\n\r\n"Who could ask him to do that?"\r\n\r\n"Not you,--certainly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"I can ask him."\r\n\r\n"Could you, Ferdinand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--with a horsewhip in my hand."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, indeed you do not know him. Will you do this;--will you tell\r\nmy father everything, and leave it to him to say whether Mr. Fletcher\r\nhas behaved badly to you?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. I will not have any interference from your father\r\nbetween you and me. If I had listened to your father, you would\r\nnot have been here now. Your father is not as yet a friend of mine.\r\nWhen he comes to know what I can do for myself, and that I can rise\r\nhigher than these Herefordshire people, then perhaps he may become my\r\nfriend. But I will consult him in nothing so peculiar to myself as my\r\nown wife. And you must understand that in coming to me all obligation\r\nfrom you to him became extinct. Of course he is your father; but\r\nin such a matter as this he has no more to say to you than any\r\nstranger." After that he hardly spoke to her; but sat for an hour\r\nwith a book in his hand, and then rose and said that he would go down\r\nto the club. "There is so much villainy about," he said, "that a man\r\nif he means to do anything must keep himself on the watch."\r\n\r\nWhen she was alone she at once burst into tears; but she soon dried\r\nher eyes, and putting down her work, settled herself to think of it\r\nall. What did it mean? Why was he thus changed to her? Could it be\r\nthat he was the same Ferdinand to whom she had given herself without\r\na doubt as to his personal merit? Every word that he had spoken since\r\nshe had shown him the letter from Arthur Fletcher had been injurious\r\nto her, and offensive. It almost seemed as though he had determined\r\nto show himself to be a tyrant to her, and had only put off playing\r\nthe part till the first convenient opportunity after their honeymoon.\r\nBut through all this, her ideas were loyal to him. She would obey him\r\nin all things where obedience was possible, and would love him better\r\nthan all the world. Oh yes;--for was he not her husband? Were he\r\nto prove himself the worst of men she would still love him. It had\r\nbeen for better or for worse; and as she had repeated the words to\r\nherself, she had sworn that if the worst should come, she would still\r\nbe true.\r\n\r\nBut she could not bring herself to say that Arthur Fletcher had\r\nbehaved badly. She could not lie. She knew well that his conduct had\r\nbeen noble and generous. Then unconsciously and involuntarily,--or\r\nrather in opposition to her own will and inward efforts,--her mind\r\nwould draw comparisons between her husband and Arthur Fletcher. There\r\nwas some peculiar gift, or grace, or acquirement belonging without\r\ndispute to the one, and which the other lacked. What was it? She had\r\nheard her father say when talking of gentlemen,--of that race of\r\ngentlemen with whom it had been his lot to live,--that you could not\r\nmake a silk purse out of a sow\'s ear. The use of the proverb had\r\noffended her much, for she had known well whom he had then regarded\r\nas a silk purse and whom as a sow\'s ear. But now she perceived that\r\nthere had been truth in all this, though she was as anxious as ever\r\nto think well of her husband, and to endow him with all possible\r\nvirtues. She had once ventured to form a doctrine for herself, to\r\npreach to herself a sermon of her own, and to tell herself that this\r\ngift of gentle blood and of gentle nurture, of which her father\r\nthought so much, and to which something of divinity was attributed\r\ndown in Herefordshire, was after all but a weak, spiritless quality.\r\nIt could exist without intellect, without heart, and with very\r\nmoderate culture. It was compatible with many littlenesses and with\r\nmany vices. As for that love of honest, courageous truth which her\r\nfather was wont to attribute to it, she regarded his theory as based\r\nupon legends, as in earlier years was the theory of the courage, and\r\nconstancy, and loyalty of the knights of those days. The beau ideal\r\nof a man which she then pictured to herself was graced, first with\r\nintelligence, then with affection, and lastly with ambition. She knew\r\nno reason why such a hero as her fancy created should be born of\r\nlords and ladies rather than of working mechanics, should be English\r\nrather than Spanish or French. The man could not be her hero without\r\neducation, without attributes to be attained no doubt more easily\r\nby the rich than by the poor; but, with that granted, with those\r\nattained, she did not see why she, or why the world, should go back\r\nbeyond the man\'s own self. Such had been her theories as to men and\r\ntheir attributes, and acting on that, she had given herself and all\r\nher happiness into the keeping of Ferdinand Lopez. Now, there was\r\ngradually coming upon her a change in her convictions,--a change that\r\nwas most unwelcome, that she strove to reject,--one which she would\r\nnot acknowledge that she had adopted even while adopting it. But\r\nnow,--ay, from the very hour of her marriage,--she had commenced to\r\nlearn what it was that her father had meant when he spoke of the\r\npleasure of living with gentlemen. Arthur Fletcher certainly was a\r\ngentleman. He would not have entertained the suspicion which her\r\nhusband had expressed. He could not have failed to believe such\r\nassertions as had been made. He could never have suggested to his own\r\nwife that another man had endeavoured to entrap her into a secret\r\ncorrespondence. She seemed to hear the tones of Arthur Fletcher\'s\r\nvoice, as those of her husband still rang in her ear when he bade her\r\nremember that she was now removed from her father\'s control. Every\r\nnow and then the tears would come to her eyes, and she would sit\r\npondering, listless, and low in heart. Then she would suddenly rouse\r\nherself with a shake, and take up her book with a resolve that she\r\nwould read steadily, would assure herself as she did so that her\r\nhusband should still be her hero. The intelligence at any rate was\r\nthere, and, in spite of his roughness, the affection which she\r\ncraved. And the ambition, too, was there. But, alas, alas! why should\r\nsuch vile suspicions have fouled his mind?\r\n\r\nHe was late that night, but when he came he kissed her brow as she\r\nlay in bed, and she knew that his temper was again smooth. She\r\nfeigned to be sleepy, though not asleep, as she just put her hand up\r\nto his cheek. She did not wish to speak to him again that night, but\r\nshe was glad to know that in the morning he would smile on her. "Be\r\nearly at breakfast," he said to her as he left her the next morning,\r\n"for I\'m going down to Silverbridge to-day."\r\n\r\nThen she started up. "To-day!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--by the 11.20. There is plenty of time, only don\'t be unusually\r\nlate."\r\n\r\nOf course she was something more than usually early, and when she\r\ncame out she found him reading his paper. "It\'s all settled now," he\r\nsaid. "Grey has applied for the Hundreds, and Mr. Rattler is to move\r\nfor the new writ to-morrow. It has come rather sudden at last, as\r\nthese things always do after long delays. But they say the suddenness\r\nis rather in my favour."\r\n\r\n"When will the election take place?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose in about a fortnight;--perhaps a little longer."\r\n\r\n"And must you be at Silverbridge all that time?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no. I shall stay there to-night, and perhaps to-morrow\r\nnight. Of course I shall telegraph to you directly I find how it is\r\nto be. I shall see the principal inhabitants, and probably make a\r\nspeech or two."\r\n\r\n"I do so wish I could hear you."\r\n\r\n"You\'d find it awfully dull work, my girl. And I shall find it\r\nawfully dull too. I do not imagine that Mr. Sprugeon and Mr. Sprout\r\nwill be pleasant companions. Well; I shall stay there a day or two\r\nand settle when I am to go down for the absolute canvass. I shall\r\nhave to go with my hat in my hand to every blessed inhabitant in that\r\ndirty little town, and ask them all to be kind enough to drop in a\r\npaper for the most humble of their servants, Ferdinand Lopez."\r\n\r\n"I suppose all candidates have to do the same."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--your friend, Master Fletcher, will have to do it." She\r\nwinced at this. Arthur Fletcher was her friend, but at the present\r\nmoment he ought not so to have spoken of him. "And from all I hear,\r\nhe is just the sort of fellow that will like the doing of it. It is\r\nodious to me to ask a fellow that I despise for anything."\r\n\r\n"Why should you despise them?"\r\n\r\n"Low, ignorant, greasy cads, who have no idea of the real meaning of\r\npolitical privileges;--men who would all sell their votes for thirty\r\nshillings each, if that game had not been made a little too hot!"\r\n\r\n"If they are like that I would not represent them."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, you would;--when you came to understand the world. It\'s\r\na fine thing to be in Parliament, and that is the way to get in.\r\nHowever, on this visit I shall only see the great men of the\r\ntown,--the Sprouts and Sprugeons."\r\n\r\n"Shall you go to Gatherum Castle?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, heavens, no! I may go anywhere now rather than there. The Duke\r\nis supposed to be in absolute ignorance of the very names of the\r\ncandidates, or whether there are candidates. I don\'t suppose that the\r\nword Silverbridge will be even whispered in his ear till the thing is\r\nover."\r\n\r\n"But you are to get in by his friendship."\r\n\r\n"Or by hers;--at least I hope so. I have no doubt that the Sprouts\r\nand the Sprugeons have been given to understand by the Lococks and\r\nthe Pritchards what are the Duchess\'s wishes, and that it has also\r\nbeen intimated in some subtle way that the Duke is willing to oblige\r\nthe Duchess. There are ever so many ways, you know, of killing a\r\ncat."\r\n\r\n"And the expense?" suggested Emily.\r\n\r\n"Oh,--ah; the expense. When you come to talk of the expense things\r\nare not so pleasant. I never saw such a set of meaningless asses in\r\nmy life as those men at the club. They talk and talk, but there is\r\nnot one of them who knows how to do anything. Now at the club over\r\nthe way they do arrange matters. It\'s a common cause, and I don\'t\r\nsee what right they have to expect that one man should bear all the\r\nexpense. I\'ve a deuced good mind to leave them in the lurch."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do it, Ferdinand, if you can\'t afford it."\r\n\r\n"I shall go on with it now. I can\'t help feeling that I\'ve been a\r\nlittle let in among them. When the Duchess first promised me it was\r\nto be a simple walk over. Now that they\'ve got their candidate, they\r\ngo back from that and open the thing to any comer. I can\'t tell you\r\nwhat I think of Fletcher for taking advantage of such a chance. And\r\nthen the political committee at the club coolly say that they\'ve got\r\nno money. It isn\'t honest, you know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand all that," said Emily sadly. Every word that he\r\nsaid about Fletcher cut her to the heart;--not because it grieved\r\nher that Fletcher should be abused, but that her husband should\r\ncondescend to abuse him. She escaped from further conflict at the\r\nmoment by proclaiming her ignorance of the whole matter; but she knew\r\nenough of it to be well aware that Arthur Fletcher had as good a\r\nright to stand as her husband, and that her husband lowered himself\r\nby personal animosity to the man. Then Lopez took his departure. "Oh,\r\nFerdinand," she said, "I do so hope you may be successful."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he can have a chance. From what people say, he must\r\nbe a fool to try. That is, if the Castle is true to me. I shall know\r\nmore about it when I come back."\r\n\r\nThat afternoon she dined with her father, and there met Mrs. Roby.\r\nIt was of course known that Lopez had gone down to Silverbridge,\r\nand Emily learned in Manchester Square that Everett had gone with\r\nhim. "From all I hear, they\'re two fools for their pains," said the\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\n"Why, papa?"\r\n\r\n"The Duke has given the thing up."\r\n\r\n"But still his interest remains."\r\n\r\n"No such thing! If there is an honest man in England it is the Duke\r\nof Omnium, and when he says a thing he means it. Left to themselves,\r\nthe people of a little town like Silverbridge are sure to return a\r\nConservative. They are half of them small farmers, and of course will\r\ngo that way if not made to go the other. If the club mean to pay the\r\ncost--"\r\n\r\n"The club will pay nothing, papa."\r\n\r\n"Then I can only hope that Lopez is doing well in his business!"\r\nAfter that, nothing further was said about the election, but she\r\nperceived that her father was altogether opposed to the idea of\r\nher husband being in Parliament, and that his sympathies and even\r\nhis wishes were on the other side. When Mrs. Roby suggested that\r\nit would be a very nice thing for them all to have Ferdinand in\r\nParliament,--she always called him Ferdinand now,--Mr. Wharton railed\r\nat her. "Why should it be a nice thing? I wonder whether you have any\r\nidea of a meaning in your head when you say that. Do you suppose that\r\na man gets L1000 a year by going into Parliament?"\r\n\r\n"Laws, Mr. Wharton; how uncivil you are! Of course I know that\r\nmembers of Parliament ain\'t paid."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the niceness then? If a man has his time at his command and\r\nhas studied the art of legislation it may be nice, because he will be\r\ndoing his duty;--or if he wants to get into the government ruck like\r\nyour brother-in-law, it may be nice;--or if he be an idle man with\r\na large fortune it may be nice to have some place to go to. But why\r\nit should be nice for Ferdinand Lopez I cannot understand. Everett\r\nhas some idea in his head when he talks about Parliament,--though I\r\ncannot say that I agree with him." It may easily be understood that\r\nafter this Emily would say nothing further in Manchester Square as to\r\nher husband\'s prospects at Silverbridge.\r\n\r\nLopez was at Silverbridge for a couple of days, and then returned,\r\nas his wife thought, by no means confident of success. He remained\r\nin town nearly a week, and during that time he managed to see the\r\nDuchess. He had written to her saying that he would do himself\r\nthe honour of calling on her, and when he came was admitted. But\r\nthe account he gave to his wife of the visit did not express much\r\nsatisfaction. It was quite late in the evening before he told her\r\nwhither he had been. He had intended to keep the matter to himself,\r\nand at last spoke of it,--guided by the feeling which induces all men\r\nto tell their secrets to their wives,--because it was a comfort to\r\nhim to talk to some one who would not openly contradict him. "She\'s a\r\nsly creature after all," he said.\r\n\r\n"I had always thought that she was too open rather than sly," said\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n"People always try to get a character just opposite to what they\r\ndeserve. When I hear that a man is always to be believed, I know that\r\nhe is the most dangerous liar going. She hummed and hawed and would\r\nnot say a word about the borough. She went so far as to tell me that\r\nI wasn\'t to say a word about it to her."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t that best if her husband wished her not to talk of it?"\r\n\r\n"It is all humbug and falsehood to the very bottom. She knows that I\r\nam spending money about it, and she ought to be on the square with\r\nme. She ought to tell me what she can do and what she can\'t. When I\r\nasked her whether Sprugeon might be trusted, she said that she really\r\nwished that I wouldn\'t say anything more to her about it. I call that\r\ndishonest and sly. I shouldn\'t at all wonder but that Fletcher has\r\nbeen with the Duke. If I find that out, won\'t I expose them both!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n"What Business Is It of Yours?"\r\n\r\n\r\nThings had not gone altogether smoothly with the Duchess herself\r\nsince the breaking up of the party at Gatherum Castle,--nor perhaps\r\nquite smoothly with the Duke. It was now March. The House was again\r\nsitting, and they were both in London,--but till they came to town\r\nthey had remained at the Castle, and that huge mansion had not\r\nbeen found to be more comfortable by either of them as it became\r\nempty. For a time the Duchess had been cowed by her husband\'s stern\r\ndecision; but as he again became gentle to her,--almost seeming by\r\nhis manner to apologise for his unwonted roughness,--she plucked up\r\nher spirit and declared to herself that she would not give up the\r\nbattle. All that she did,--was it not for his sake? And why should\r\nshe not have her ambition in life as well as he his? And had she not\r\nsucceeded in all that she had done? Could it be right that she should\r\nbe asked to abandon everything, to own herself to have been defeated,\r\nto be shown to have failed before all the world, because such a one\r\nas Major Pountney had made a fool of himself? She attributed it\r\nall to Major Pountney;--very wrongly. When a man\'s mind is veering\r\ntowards some decision, some conclusion which he has been perhaps slow\r\nin reaching, it is probably a little thing which at last fixes his\r\nmind and clenches his thoughts. The Duke had been gradually teaching\r\nhimself to hate the crowd around him and to reprobate his wife\'s\r\nstrategy, before he had known that there was a Major Pountney under\r\nhis roof. Others had offended him, and first and foremost among them\r\nhis own colleague, Sir Orlando. The Duchess hardly read his character\r\naright, and certainly did not understand his present motives, when\r\nshe thought that all might be forgotten as soon as the disagreeable\r\nsavour of the Major should have passed away.\r\n\r\nBut in nothing, as she thought, had her husband been so silly as in\r\nhis abandonment of Silverbridge. When she heard that the day was\r\nfixed for declaring the vacancy, she ventured to ask him a question.\r\nHis manner to her lately had been more than urbane, more than\r\naffectionate;--it had almost been that of a lover. He had petted\r\nher and caressed her when they met, and once even said that nothing\r\nshould really trouble him as long as he had her with him. Such a\r\nspeech as that never in his life had he made before to her! So she\r\nplucked up her courage and asked her question,--not exactly on that\r\noccasion, but soon afterwards; "May not I say a word to Sprugeon\r\nabout the election?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word!" And he looked at her as he had looked on that day when\r\nhe had told her of the Major\'s sins. She tossed her head and pouted\r\nher lips and walked on without speaking. If it was to be so, then\r\nindeed would she have failed. And, therefore, though in his general\r\nmanner he was loving to her, things were not going smooth with her.\r\n\r\nAnd things were not going smooth with him because there had reached\r\nhim a most troublous dispatch from Sir Orlando Drought only two days\r\nbefore the Cabinet meeting at which the points to be made in the\r\nQueen\'s speech were to be decided. It had been already agreed that a\r\nproposition should be made to Parliament by the Government, for an\r\nextension of the county suffrage, with some slight redistribution of\r\nseats. The towns with less than 20,000 inhabitants were to take in\r\nsome increased portions of the country parishes around. But there was\r\nnot enough of a policy in this to satisfy Sir Orlando, nor was the\r\nconduct of the bill through the House to be placed in his hands.\r\nThat was to be intrusted to Mr. Monk, and Mr. Monk would be, if not\r\nnominally the Leader, yet the chief man of the Government in the\r\nHouse of Commons. This was displeasing to Sir Orlando, and he had,\r\ntherefore, demanded from the Prime Minister more of a "policy." Sir\r\nOrlando\'s present idea of a policy was the building four bigger\r\nships of war than had ever been built before,--with larger guns, and\r\nmore men, and thicker iron plates, and, above all, with a greater\r\nexpenditure of money. He had even gone so far as to say, though\r\nnot in his semi-official letter to the Prime Minister, that he\r\nthought that "The Salvation of the Empire" should be the cry of the\r\nCoalition party. "After all," he said, "what the people care about\r\nis the Salvation of the Empire!" Sir Orlando was at the head of the\r\nAdmiralty; and if glory was to be achieved by the four ships, it\r\nwould rest first on the head of Sir Orlando.\r\n\r\nNow the Duke thought that the Empire was safe, and had been\r\nthroughout his political life averse to increasing the army and navy\r\nestimates. He regarded the four ships as altogether unnecessary,--and\r\nwhen reminded that he might in this way consolidate the Coalition,\r\nsaid that he would rather do without the Coalition and the four\r\nships than have to do with both of them together,--an opinion which\r\nwas thought by some to be almost traitorous to the party as now\r\norganised. The secrets of Cabinets are not to be disclosed lightly,\r\nbut it came to be understood,--as what is done at Cabinet meetings\r\ngenerally does come to be understood,--that there was something like\r\na disagreement. The Prime Minister, the Duke of St. Bungay, and\r\nMr. Monk were altogether against the four ships. Sir Orlando was\r\nsupported by Lord Drummond and another of his old friends. At the\r\nadvice of the elder Duke, a paragraph was hatched, in which it was\r\ndeclared that her Majesty, "having regard to the safety of the nation\r\nand the possible, though happily not probable, chances of war,\r\nthought that the present strength of the navy should be considered."\r\n"It will give him scope for a new gun-boat on an altered principle,"\r\nsaid the Duke of St. Bungay. But the Prime Minister, could he have\r\nhad his own way, would have given Sir Orlando no scope whatever. He\r\nwould have let the Coalition have gone to the dogs and have fallen\r\nhimself into infinite political ruin, but that he did not dare that\r\nmen should hereafter say of him that this attempt at government had\r\nfailed because he was stubborn, imperious, and self-confident. He had\r\nknown when he took his present place that he must yield to others;\r\nbut he had not known how terrible it is to have to yield when a\r\nprinciple is in question,--how great is the suffering when a man\r\nfinds himself compelled to do that which he thinks should not be\r\ndone! Therefore, though he had been strangely loving to his wife, the\r\ntime had not gone smoothly with him.\r\n\r\nIn direct disobedience to her husband the Duchess did speak a word to\r\nMr. Sprugeon. When at the Castle she was frequently driven through\r\nSilverbridge, and on one occasion had her carriage stopped at the\r\nironmonger\'s door. Out came Mr. Sprugeon, and there were at first\r\nhalf-a-dozen standing by who could hear what she said. Millepois,\r\nthe cook, wanted to have some new kind of iron plate erected in the\r\nkitchen. Of course she had provided herself beforehand with her\r\nexcuse. As a rule, when the cook wanted anything done, he did not\r\nsend word to the tradesman by the Duchess. But on this occasion the\r\nDuchess was personally most anxious. She wanted to see how the iron\r\nplate would work. It was to be a particular kind of iron plate. Then,\r\nhaving watched her opportunity, she said her word, "I suppose we\r\nshall be safe with Mr. Lopez?" When Mr. Sprugeon was about to reply,\r\nshe shook her head and went on about the iron plate. This would\r\nbe quite enough to let Mr. Sprugeon understand that she was still\r\nanxious about the borough. Mr. Sprugeon was an intelligent man, and\r\npossessed of discretion to a certain extent. As soon as he saw the\r\nlittle frown and the shake of the head, he understood it all. He and\r\nthe Duchess had a secret together. Would not everything about the\r\nCastle in which a morsel of iron was employed want renewing? And\r\nwould not the Duchess take care that it should all be renewed by\r\nSprugeon? But then he must be active, and his activity would be of no\r\navail unless others helped him. So he whispered a word to Sprout, and\r\nit soon became known that the Castle interest was all alive.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately the Duke was also on the alert. The Duke had been\r\nvery much in earnest when he made up his mind that the old custom\r\nshould be abandoned at Silverbridge and had endeavoured to impress\r\nthat determination of his upon his wife. The Duke knew more about his\r\nproperty and was better acquainted with its details than his wife or\r\nothers believed. He heard that in spite of all his orders the Castle\r\ninterest was being maintained, and a word was said to him which\r\nseemed to imply that this was his wife\'s doings. It was then about\r\nthe middle of February, and arrangements were in process for the\r\nremoval of the family to London. The Duke had already been up to\r\nLondon for the meeting of Parliament, and had now come back to\r\nGatherum, purporting to return to London with his wife. Then it was\r\nthat it was hinted to him that her Grace was still anxious as to\r\nthe election,--and had manifested her anxiety. The rumour hurt him,\r\nthough he did not in the least believe it. It showed to him, as\r\nhe thought, not that his wife had been false to him,--as in truth\r\nshe had been,--but that even her name could not be kept free from\r\nslander. And when he spoke to her on the subject, he did so rather\r\nwith the view of proving to her how necessary it was that she should\r\nkeep herself altogether aloof from such matters, than with any wish\r\nto make further inquiry. But he elicited the whole truth. "It is so\r\nhard to kill an old established evil," he said.\r\n\r\n"What evil have you failed to kill now?"\r\n\r\n"Those people at Silverbridge still say that I want to return a\r\nmember for them."\r\n\r\n"Oh; that\'s the evil! You know I think that instead of killing an\r\nevil, you have murdered an excellent institution." This at any rate\r\nwas very imprudent on the part of the Duchess. After that disobedient\r\nword spoken to Mr. Sprugeon, she should have been more on her guard.\r\n\r\n"As to that, Glencora, I must judge for myself."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes,--you have been jury, and judge, and executioner."\r\n\r\n"I have done as I thought right to do. I am sorry that I should fail\r\nto carry you with me in such a matter, but even failing in that I\r\nmust do my duty. You will at any rate agree with me that when I say\r\nthe thing should be done, it should be done."\r\n\r\n"If you wanted to destroy the house, and cut down all the trees,\r\nand turn the place into a wilderness, I suppose you would only have\r\nto speak. Of course I know it would be wrong that I should have an\r\nopinion. As \'man\' you are of course to have your own way." She was\r\nin one of her most aggravating moods. Though he might compel her to\r\nobey, he could not compel her to hold her tongue.\r\n\r\n"Glencora, I don\'t think you know how much you add to my troubles, or\r\nyou would not speak to me like that."\r\n\r\n"What am I to say? It seems to me that any more suicidal thing than\r\nthrowing away the borough never was done. Who will thank you? What\r\nadditional support will you get? How will it increase your power?\r\nIt\'s like King Lear throwing off his clothes in the storm because his\r\ndaughters turned him out. And you didn\'t do it because you thought it\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did," he said, scowling.\r\n\r\n"You did it because Major Pountney disgusted you. You kicked him out.\r\nWhy wouldn\'t that satisfy you without sacrificing the borough? It\r\nisn\'t what I think or say about it, but that everybody is thinking\r\nand saying the same thing."\r\n\r\n"I choose that it shall be so."\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t choose that your name shall be mixed up in it. They say\r\nin Silverbridge that you are canvassing for Mr. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"Who says so?"\r\n\r\n"I presume it\'s not true."\r\n\r\n"Who says so, Plantagenet?"\r\n\r\n"It matters not who has said so, if it be untrue. I presume it to be\r\nfalse."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is false." Then the Duchess remembered her word to Mr.\r\nSprugeon, and the cowardice of the lie was heavy on her. I doubt\r\nwhether she would have been so shocked by the idea of a falsehood as\r\nto have been kept back from it had she before resolved that it would\r\nsave her; but she was not in her practice a false woman, her courage\r\nbeing too high for falsehood. It now seemed to her that by this\r\nlie she was owning herself to be quelled and brought into absolute\r\nsubjection by her husband. So she burst out into truth. "Now I think\r\nof it, I did say a word to Mr. Sprugeon. I told him that--that I\r\nhoped Mr. Lopez would be returned. I don\'t know whether you call that\r\ncanvassing."\r\n\r\n"I desired you not to speak to Mr. Sprugeon," he thundered forth.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well, Plantagenet, but if you desire me to hold my\r\ntongue altogether, what am I to do?"\r\n\r\n"What business is this of yours?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I may have my political sympathies as well as another.\r\nReally you are becoming so autocratic that I shall have to go in for\r\nwomen\'s rights."\r\n\r\n"You mean me to understand then that you intend to put yourself in\r\nopposition to me."\r\n\r\n"What a fuss you make about it all!" she said. "Nothing that one can\r\ndo is right! You make me wish that I was a milkmaid or a farmer\'s\r\nwife." So saying she bounced out of the room, leaving the Duke sick\r\nat heart, low in spirit, and doubtful whether he were right or wrong\r\nin his attempts to manage his wife. Surely he must be right in\r\nfeeling that in his high office a clearer conduct and cleaner way of\r\nwalking was expected from him than from other men! Noblesse oblige!\r\nTo his uncle the privilege of returning a member to Parliament had\r\nbeen a thing of course; and when the Radical newspapers of the day\r\nabused his uncle, his uncle took that abuse as a thing of course. The\r\nold Duke acted after his kind, and did not care what others said of\r\nhim. And he himself, when he first came to his dukedom, was not as\r\nhe was now. Duties, though they were heavy enough, were lighter then.\r\nSerious matters were less serious. There was this and that matter\r\nof public policy on which he was intent, but, thinking humbly of\r\nhimself, he had not yet learned to conceive that he must fit his\r\npublic conduct in all things to a straight rule of patriotic justice.\r\nNow it was different with him, and though the change was painful, he\r\nfelt it to be imperative. He would fain have been as other men, but\r\nhe could not. But in this change it was so needful to him that he\r\nshould carry with him the full sympathies of one person;--that she\r\nwho was the nearest to him of all should act with him! And now she\r\nhad not only disobeyed him, but had told him, as some grocer\'s wife\r\nmight tell her husband, that he was "making a fuss about it all!"\r\n\r\nAnd then, as he thought of the scene which has been described,\r\nhe could not quite approve of himself. He knew that he was too\r\nself-conscious,--that he was thinking too much about his own conduct\r\nand the conduct of others to him. The phrase had been odious to him,\r\nbut still he could not acquit himself of "making a fuss." Of one\r\nthing only was he sure,--that a grievous calamity had befallen\r\nhim when circumstances compelled him to become the Queen\'s Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing further to his wife till they were in London\r\ntogether, and then he was tempted to caress her again, to be loving\r\nto her, and to show her that he had forgiven her. But she was brusque\r\nto him, as though she did not wish to be forgiven. "Cora," he said,\r\n"do not separate yourself from me."\r\n\r\n"Separate myself! What on earth do you mean? I have not dreamed of\r\nsuch a thing." The Duchess answered him as though he had alluded to\r\nsome actual separation.\r\n\r\n"I do not mean that. God forbid that a misfortune such as that should\r\never happen! Do not disjoin yourself from me in all these troubles."\r\n\r\n"What am I to do when you scold me? You must know pretty well by this\r\ntime that I don\'t like to be scolded. \'I desired you not to speak to\r\nMr. Sprugeon!\'" As she repeated his words she imitated his manner and\r\nvoice closely. "I shouldn\'t dream of addressing the children with\r\nsuch magnificence of anger. \'What business is it of yours?\' No woman\r\nlikes that sort of thing, and I\'m not sure that I am acquainted with\r\nany woman who likes it much less than--Glencora, Duchess of Omnium."\r\nAs she said these last words in a low whisper, she curtseyed down to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n"You know how anxious I am," he began, "that you should share\r\neverything with me,--even in politics. But in all things there must\r\nat last be one voice that shall be the ruling voice."\r\n\r\n"And that is to be yours,--of course."\r\n\r\n"In such a matter as this it must be."\r\n\r\n"And, therefore, I like to do a little business of my own behind your\r\nback. It\'s human nature, and you\'ve got to put up with it. I wish\r\nyou had a better wife. I dare say there are many who would be better.\r\nThere\'s the Duchess of St. Bungay who never troubles her husband\r\nabout politics, but only scolds him because the wind blows from the\r\neast. It is just possible there might be worse."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Glencora!"\r\n\r\n"You had better make the best you can of your bargain and not expect\r\ntoo much from her. And don\'t ride over her with a very high horse.\r\nAnd let her have her own way a little if you really believe that she\r\nhas your interest at heart."\r\n\r\nAfter this he was quite aware that she had got the better of him\r\naltogether. On that occasion he smiled and kissed her, and went his\r\nway. But he was by no means satisfied. That he should be thwarted by\r\nher, ate into his very heart;--and it was a wretched thing to him\r\nthat he could not make her understand his feeling in this respect.\r\nIf it were to go on he must throw up everything. Ruat coelum,\r\nfiat--proper subordination from his wife in regard to public matters!\r\nNo wife had a fuller allowance of privilege, or more complete power\r\nin her hands, as to things fit for women\'s management. But it was\r\nintolerable to him that she should seek to interfere with him in\r\nmatters of a public nature. And she was constantly doing so. She\r\nhad always this or that aspirant for office on hand;--this or\r\nthat job to be carried, though the jobs were not perhaps much in\r\nthemselves;--this or that affair to be managed by her own political\r\nallies, such as Barrington Erle and Phineas Finn. And in his heart he\r\nsuspected her of a design of managing the Government in her own way,\r\nwith her own particular friend, Mrs. Finn, for her Prime Minister. If\r\nhe could in no other way put an end to such evils as these, he must\r\nput an end to his own political life. Ruat coelum, fiat justitia.\r\nNow "justitia" to him was not compatible with feminine interference\r\nin his own special work.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be understood that things were not going very\r\nsmoothly with the Duke and Duchess; and it may also be understood\r\nwhy the Duchess had had very little to say to Mr. Lopez about the\r\nelection. She was aware that she owed something to Mr. Lopez, whom\r\nshe had certainly encouraged to stand for the borough, and she had\r\ntherefore sent her card to his wife and was prepared to invite them\r\nboth to her parties;--but just at present she was a little tired of\r\nFerdinand Lopez, and perhaps unjustly disposed to couple him with\r\nthat unfortunate wretch, Major Pountney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nShowing That a Man Should Not Howl\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Fletcher, in his letter to Mrs. Lopez, had told her that when\r\nhe found out who was to be his antagonist at Silverbridge, it was too\r\nlate for him to give up the contest. He was, he said, bound in faith\r\nto continue it by what had passed between himself and others. But in\r\ntruth he had not reached his conclusion without some persuasion from\r\nothers. He had been at Longbarns with his brother when he first heard\r\nthat Lopez intended to stand, and he at once signified his desire\r\nto give way. The information reached him from Mr. Frank Gresham, of\r\nGreshamsbury, a gentleman connected with the De Courcys who was now\r\nsupposed to represent the De Courcy interest in the county, and who\r\nhad first suggested to Arthur that he should come forward. It was\r\nheld at Longbarns that Arthur was bound in honour to Mr. Gresham and\r\nto Mr. Gresham\'s friends, and to this opinion he had yielded.\r\n\r\nSince Emily Wharton\'s marriage her name had never been mentioned at\r\nLongbarns in Arthur\'s presence. When he was away,--and of course his\r\nlife was chiefly passed in London,--old Mrs. Fletcher was free enough\r\nin her abuse of the silly creature who had allowed herself to be\r\ntaken out of her own rank by a Portuguese Jew. But she had been made\r\nto understand by her elder son, the lord of Longbarns, that not a\r\nword was to be said when Arthur was there. "I think he ought to be\r\ntaught to forget her," Mrs. Fletcher had said. But John in his own\r\nquiet but imperious way, had declared that there were some men to\r\nwhom such lessons could not be taught, and that Arthur was one of\r\nthem. "Is he never to get a wife, then?" Mrs. Fletcher had asked.\r\nJohn wouldn\'t pretend to answer that question, but was quite sure\r\nthat his brother would not be tempted into other matrimonial\r\narrangements by anything that could be said against Emily Lopez. When\r\nMrs. Fletcher declared in her extreme anger that Arthur was a fool\r\nfor his trouble, John did not contradict her, but declared that the\r\nfolly was of a nature to require tender treatment.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this condition at Longbarns when Arthur communicated\r\nto his brother the contents of Mr. Gresham\'s letter, and expressed\r\nhis own purpose of giving up Silverbridge. "I don\'t quite see that,"\r\nsaid John.\r\n\r\n"No;--and it is impossible that you should be expected to see it. I\r\ndon\'t quite know how to talk about it even to you, though I think you\r\nare about the softest-hearted fellow out."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t acknowledge the soft heart;--but go on."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to interfere with that man. I have a sort of feeling\r\nthat as he has got her he might as well have the seat too."\r\n\r\n"The seat, as you call it, is not there for his gratification or for\r\nyours. The seat is there in order that the people of Silverbridge may\r\nbe represented in Parliament."\r\n\r\n"Let them get somebody else. I don\'t want to put myself in opposition\r\nto him, and I certainly do not want to oppose her."\r\n\r\n"They can\'t change their candidate in that way at a day\'s notice.\r\nYou would be throwing Gresham over, and, if you ask me, I think\r\nthat is a thing you have no right to do. This objection of yours is\r\nsentimental, and there is nothing of which a man should be so much\r\nin dread as sentimentalism. It is not your fault that you oppose\r\nMr. Lopez. You were in the field first, and you must go on with it."\r\nJohn Fletcher, when he spoke in this way, was, at Longbarns, always\r\nsupposed to be right; and on the present occasion he, as usual,\r\nprevailed. Then Arthur Fletcher wrote his letter to the lady. He\r\nwould not have liked to have had it known that the composition and\r\ncopying of that little note had cost him an hour. He had wished that\r\nshe should understand his feelings, and yet it was necessary that\r\nhe should address her in words that should be perfectly free from\r\naffection or emotion. He must let her know that, though he wrote to\r\nher, the letter was for her husband as well as for herself, and he\r\nmust do this in a manner which would not imply any fear that his\r\nwriting to her would be taken amiss. The letter when completed was at\r\nany rate simple and true; and yet, as we know, it was taken very much\r\namiss.\r\n\r\nArthur Fletcher had by no means recovered from the blow he had\r\nreceived that day when Emily had told him everything down by the\r\nriver side; but then, it must be said of him, that he had no\r\nintention of recovery. He was as a man who, having taken a burden\r\non his back, declares to himself that he will, for certain reasons,\r\ncarry it throughout his life. The man knows that with the burden he\r\ncannot walk as men walk who are unencumbered, but for those reasons\r\nof his he has chosen to lade himself, and having done so he abandons\r\nregret and submits to his circumstances. So had it been with him.\r\nHe would make no attempt to throw off the load. It was now far back\r\nin his life, as much at least as three years, since he had first\r\nassured himself of his desire to make Emily Wharton the companion\r\nof his life. From that day she had been the pivot on which his whole\r\nexistence had moved. She had refused his offers more than once, but\r\nhad done so with so much tender kindness, that, though he had found\r\nhimself to be wounded and bruised, he had never abandoned his object.\r\nHer father and all his own friends encouraged him. He was continually\r\ntold that her coldness was due to the simple fact that she had not\r\nyet learned to give her heart away. And so he had persevered, being\r\never thoroughly intent on his purpose, till he was told by herself\r\nthat her love was given to this other man.\r\n\r\nThen he knew that it behoved him to set some altered course of life\r\nbefore him. He could not shoot his rival or knock him over the head,\r\nnor could he carry off his girl, as used to be done in rougher times.\r\nThere was nothing now for a man in such a catastrophe as this but\r\nsubmission. But he might submit and shake off his burden, or submit\r\nand carry it hopelessly. He told himself that he would do the latter.\r\nShe had been his goddess, and he would not now worship at another\r\nshrine. And then ideas came into his head,--not hopes, or purposes,\r\nor a belief even in any possibility,--but vague ideas, mere castles\r\nin the air, that a time might come in which it might be in his power\r\nto serve her, and to prove to her beyond doubting what had been the\r\nnature of his love. Like others of his family, he thought ill of\r\nLopez, believing the man to be an adventurer, one who would too\r\nprobably fall into misfortune, however high he might now seem to hold\r\nhis head. He was certainly a man not standing on the solid basis of\r\nland, or of Three per Cents,--those solidities to which such as the\r\nWhartons and Fletchers are wont to trust. No doubt, should there be\r\nsuch fall, the man\'s wife would have other help than that of her\r\nrejected lover. She had a father, brother, and cousins, who would\r\nalso be there to aid her. The idea was, therefore, but a castle in\r\nthe air. And yet it was dear to him. At any rate he resolved that he\r\nwould live for it, and that the woman should still be his goddess,\r\nthough she was the wife of another man, and might now perhaps never\r\neven be seen by him. Then there came upon him, immediately almost\r\nafter her marriage, the necessity of writing to her. The task was one\r\nwhich, of course, he did not perform lightly.\r\n\r\nHe never said a word of this to anybody else;--but his brother\r\nunderstood it all, and in a somewhat silent fashion fully sympathised\r\nwith him. John could not talk to him about love, or mark passages of\r\npoetry for him to read, or deal with him at all romantically; but he\r\ncould take care that his brother had the best horses to ride, and the\r\nwarmest corner out shooting, and that everything in the house should\r\nbe done for his brother\'s comfort. As the squire looked and spoke\r\nat Longbarns, others looked and spoke,--so that everybody knew that\r\nMr. Arthur was to be contradicted in nothing. Had he, just at this\r\nperiod, ordered a tree in the park to be cut down, it would, I think,\r\nhave been cut down, without reference to the master! But, perhaps,\r\nJohn\'s power was most felt in the way in which he repressed the\r\nexpressions of his mother\'s high indignation. "Mean slut!" she once\r\nsaid, speaking of Emily in her eldest son\'s hearing. For the girl,\r\nto her thinking, had been mean and had been a slut. She had not\r\nknown,--so Mrs. Fletcher thought,--what birth and blood required of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Mother," John Fletcher had said, "you would break Arthur\'s heart if\r\nhe heard you speak in that way, and I am sure you would drive him\r\nfrom Longbarns. Keep it to yourself." The old woman had shaken her\r\nhead angrily, but she had endeavoured to do as she had been bid.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t your brother riding that horse a little rashly?" Reginald\r\nCotgrave said to John Fletcher in the hunting field one day.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t observe," said John; "but whatever horse he\'s on, he always\r\nrides rashly." Arthur was mounted on a long, raking thorough-bred\r\nblack animal, which he had bought himself about a month ago, and\r\nwhich, having been run at steeplechases, rushed at every fence as\r\nthough he were going to swallow it. His brother had begged him to put\r\nsome rough-rider up till the horse could be got to go quietly, but\r\nArthur had persevered. And during the whole of this day the squire\r\nhad been in a tremor, lest there should be some accident.\r\n\r\n"He used to have a little more judgment, I think," said Cotgrave. "He\r\nwent at that double just now as hard as the brute could tear. If the\r\nhorse hadn\'t done it all, where would he have been?"\r\n\r\n"In the further ditch, I suppose. But you see the horse did do it\r\nall."\r\n\r\nThis was all very well as an answer to Reginald Cotgrave,--to whom\r\nit was not necessary that Fletcher should explain the circumstances.\r\nBut the squire had known as well as Cotgrave that his brother had\r\nbeen riding rashly, and he had understood the reason why. "I don\'t\r\nthink a man ought to break his neck," he said, "because he can\'t\r\nget everything that he wishes." The two brothers were standing then\r\ntogether before the fire in the squire\'s own room, having just come\r\nin from hunting.\r\n\r\n"Who is going to break his neck?"\r\n\r\n"They tell me that you tried to to-day."\r\n\r\n"Because I was riding a pulling horse. I\'ll back him to be the\r\nbiggest leaper and the quickest horse in Herefordshire."\r\n\r\n"I dare say,--though for the matter of that the chances are very much\r\nagainst it. But a man shouldn\'t ride so as to have those things said\r\nof him."\r\n\r\n"What is a fellow to do if he can\'t hold a horse?"\r\n\r\n"Get off him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, John!"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s not. You know what I mean very well. If I were to lose half\r\nmy property to-morrow, don\'t you think it would cut me up a good\r\ndeal?"\r\n\r\n"It would me, I know."\r\n\r\n"But what would you think of me if I howled about it?"\r\n\r\n"Do I howl?" asked Arthur angrily.\r\n\r\n"Every man howls who is driven out of his ordinary course by any\r\ntrouble. A man howls if he goes about frowning always."\r\n\r\n"Do I frown?"\r\n\r\n"Or laughing."\r\n\r\n"Do I laugh?"\r\n\r\n"Or galloping over the country like a mad devil who wants to get rid\r\nof his debts by breaking his neck. Aequam memento--. You remember all\r\nthat, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I remember it; but it isn\'t so easy to do it."\r\n\r\n"Try. There are other things to be done in life except getting\r\nmarried. You are going into Parliament."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that."\r\n\r\n"Gresham tells me there isn\'t a doubt about it. Think of that. Fix\r\nyour mind upon it. Don\'t take it only as an accident, but as the\r\nthing you\'re to live for. If you\'ll do that,--if you\'ll so manage\r\nthat there shall be something to be done in Parliament which only you\r\ncan do, you won\'t ride a runaway horse as you did that brute to-day."\r\nArthur looked up into his brother\'s face almost weeping. "We expect\r\nmuch of you, you know. I\'m not a man to do anything except be a good\r\nsteward for the family property, and keep the old house from falling\r\ndown. You\'re a clever fellow,--so that between us, if we both do our\r\nduty, the Fletchers may still thrive in the land. My house shall be\r\nyour house, and my wife your wife, and my children your children. And\r\nthen the honour you win shall be my honour. Hold up your head,--and\r\nsell that beast." Arthur Fletcher squeezed his brother\'s hand and\r\nwent away to dress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nThe Silverbridge Election\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a month after this affair with the runaway horse Arthur\r\nFletcher went to Greshamsbury, preparatory to his final sojourn at\r\nSilverbridge for the week previous to his election. Greshamsbury, the\r\nseat of Francis Gresham, Esq., who was a great man in these parts,\r\nwas about twenty miles from Silverbridge, and the tedious work of\r\ncanvassing the electors could not therefore be done from thence;--but\r\nhe spent a couple of pleasant days with his old friend, and learned\r\nwhat was being said and what was being done in and about the borough.\r\nMr. Gresham was a man, not as yet quite forty years of age, very\r\npopular, with a large family, of great wealth, and master of the\r\ncounty hounds. His father had been an embarrassed man, with a large\r\nestate; but this Gresham had married a lady with immense wealth,\r\nand had prospered in the world. He was not an active politician. He\r\ndid not himself care for Parliament, or for the good things which\r\npolitical power can give, and was on this account averse to the\r\nCoalition. He thought that Sir Orlando Drought and the others were\r\ntouching pitch and had defiled themselves. But he was conscious that\r\nin so thinking he was one of but a small minority; and, bad as the\r\nworld around him certainly was, terrible as had been the fall of the\r\nglory of old England, he was nevertheless content to live without\r\nloud grumbling as long as the farmers paid him their rent, and the\r\nlabourers in his part of the country did not strike for wages, and\r\nthe land when sold would fetch thirty years\' purchase. He had not\r\ntherefore been careful to ascertain that Arthur Fletcher would pledge\r\nhimself to oppose the Coalition before he proffered his assistance\r\nin this matter of the borough. It would not be easy to find such\r\na candidate, or perhaps possible to bring him in when found. The\r\nFletchers had always been good Conservatives, and were proper people\r\nto be in Parliament. A Conservative in Parliament is, of course,\r\nobliged to promote a great many things which he does not really\r\napprove. Mr. Gresham quite understood that. You can\'t have tests and\r\nqualifications, rotten boroughs and the divine right of kings, back\r\nagain. But as the glorious institutions of the country are made to\r\nperish, one after the other, it is better that they should receive\r\nthe coup de grace tenderly from loving hands than be roughly\r\nthrottled by Radicals. Mr. Gresham would thank his stars that he\r\ncould still preserve foxes down in his own country, instead of doing\r\nany of this dirty work,--for let the best be made of such work,\r\nstill it was dirty,--and was willing, now as always, to give his\r\nassistance, and if necessary to spend a little money, to put a\r\nFletcher into Parliament and to keep a Lopez out.\r\n\r\nThere was to be a third candidate. That was the first news that\r\nFletcher heard. "It will do us all the good in the world," said Mr.\r\nGresham. "The Rads in the borough are not satisfied with Mr. Lopez.\r\nThey say they don\'t know him. As long as a certain set could make\r\nit be believed that he was the Duke\'s nominee they were content to\r\naccept him;--even though he was not proposed directly by the Duke\'s\r\npeople in the usual way. But the Duke has made himself understood\r\nat last. You have seen the Duke\'s letter?" Arthur had not seen the\r\nDuke\'s letter, which had only been published in the "Silverbridge\r\nGazette" of that week, and he now read it, sitting in Mr. Gresham\'s\r\nmagistrate\'s-room, as a certain chamber in the house had been called\r\nsince the days of the present squire\'s great-grandfather.\r\n\r\nThe Duke\'s letter was addressed to his recognised man of business in\r\nthose parts, and was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Carlton Terrace, -- March, 187--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. MORETON, [Mr. Moreton was the successor of one\r\n   Mr. Fothergill, who had reigned supreme in those parts\r\n   under the old Duke.]\r\n\r\n   I am afraid that my wishes with regard to the borough and\r\n   the forthcoming election there of a member of Parliament\r\n   are not yet clearly understood, although I endeavoured to\r\n   declare them when I was at Gatherum Castle. I trust that\r\n   no elector will vote for this or that gentleman with an\r\n   idea that the return of any special candidate will please\r\n   me. The ballot will of course prevent me or any other man\r\n   from knowing how an elector may vote;--but I beg to assure\r\n   the electors generally that should they think fit to\r\n   return a member pledged to oppose the Government of which\r\n   I form a part, it would not in any way change my cordial\r\n   feelings towards the town. I may perhaps be allowed to add\r\n   that, in my opinion, no elector can do his duty except by\r\n   voting for the candidate whom he thinks best qualified to\r\n   serve the country. In regard to the gentlemen who are now\r\n   before the constituency, I have no feeling for one rather\r\n   than for the other; and had I any such feeling I should\r\n   not wish it to actuate the vote of a single elector. I\r\n   should be glad if this letter could be published so as to\r\n   be brought under the eyes of the electors generally.\r\n\r\n   Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n   OMNIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke said that he feared that his wishes were not\r\nunderstood, and spoke of the inefficacy of his former declaration,\r\nhe was alluding of course to the Duchess and to Mr. Sprugeon. Mr.\r\nSprugeon guessed that it might be so, and, still wishing to have the\r\nDuchess for his good friend, was at once assiduous in explaining\r\nto his friends in the borough that even this letter did not mean\r\nanything. A Prime Minister was bound to say that kind of thing! But\r\nthe borough, if it wished to please the Duke, must return Lopez in\r\nspite of the Duke\'s letter. Such was Mr. Sprugeon\'s doctrine. But\r\nhe did not carry Mr. Sprout with him. Mr. Sprout at once saw his\r\nopportunity, and suggested to Mr. Du Boung, the local brewer, that\r\nhe should come forward. Du Boung was a man rapidly growing into\r\nprovincial eminence, and jumped at the offer. Consequently there were\r\nthree candidates. Du Boung came forward as a Conservative prepared to\r\ngive a cautious, but very cautious, support to the Coalition. Mr. Du\r\nBoung, in his printed address, said very sweet things of the Duke\r\ngenerally. The borough was blessed by the vicinity of the Duke. But,\r\nlooking at the present perhaps unprecedented crisis in affairs, Mr.\r\nDu Boung was prepared to give no more than a very cautious support to\r\nthe Duke\'s Government. Arthur Fletcher read Mr. Du Boung\'s address\r\nimmediately after the Duke\'s letter.\r\n\r\n"The more the merrier," said Arthur.\r\n\r\n"Just so. Du Boung will not rob you of a vote, but he will cut the\r\nground altogether from under the other man\'s feet. You see that as\r\nfar as actual political programme goes there isn\'t much to choose\r\nbetween any of you. You are all Government men."\r\n\r\n"With a difference."\r\n\r\n"One man in these days is so like another," continued Gresham\r\nsarcastically, "that it requires good eyes to see the shades of the\r\ncolours."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'d better support Du Boung," said Arthur.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'ve just a turn in your favour. Besides, I couldn\'t\r\nreally carry a vote myself. As for Du Boung, I\'d sooner have him\r\nthan a foreign cad like Lopez." Then Arthur Fletcher frowned and Mr.\r\nGresham became confused, remembering the catastrophe about the young\r\nlady whose story he had heard. "Du Boung used to be plain English\r\nas Bung before he got rich and made his name beautiful," continued\r\nGresham, "but I suppose Mr. Lopez does come of foreign extraction."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what he comes from," said Arthur moodily. "They tell\r\nme he\'s a gentleman. However, as we are to have a contest, I hope he\r\nmayn\'t win."\r\n\r\n"Of course you do. And he shan\'t win. Nor shall the great Du Boung.\r\nYou shall win, and become Prime Minister, and make me a peer. Would\r\nyou like papa to be Lord Greshamsbury?" he said to a little girl, who\r\nthen rushed into the room.\r\n\r\n"No, I wouldn\'t. I\'d like papa to give me the pony which the man\r\nwants to sell out in the yard."\r\n\r\n"She\'s quite right, Fletcher," said the squire. "I\'m much more likely\r\nto be able to buy them ponies as simple Frank Gresham than I should\r\nbe if I had a lord\'s coronet to pay for."\r\n\r\nThis was on a Saturday, and on the following Monday Mr. Gresham\r\ndrove the candidate over to Silverbridge and started him on his work\r\nof canvassing. Mr. Du Boung had been busy ever since Mr. Sprout\'s\r\nbrilliant suggestion had been made, and Lopez had been in the field\r\neven before him. Each one of the candidates called at the house of\r\nevery elector in the borough,--and every man in the borough was\r\nan elector. When they had been at work for four or five days each\r\ncandidate assured the borough that he had already received promises\r\nof votes sufficient to insure his success, and each candidate was\r\nas anxious as ever,--nay, was more rabidly anxious than ever,--to\r\nsecure the promise of a single vote. Hints were made by honest\r\ncitizens of the pleasure they would have in supporting this or that\r\ngentleman,--for the honest citizens assured one gentleman after the\r\nother of the satisfaction they had in seeing so all-sufficient a\r\ncandidate in the borough,--if the smallest pecuniary help were given\r\nthem, even a day\'s pay, so that their poor children might not be\r\ninjured by their going to the poll. But the candidates and their\r\nagents were stern in their replies to such temptations. "That\'s a\r\ndodge of that rascal Sprout," said Sprugeon to Mr. Lopez. "That\'s one\r\nof Sprout\'s men. If he could get half-a-crown from you it would be\r\nall up with us." But though Sprugeon called Sprout a rascal, he laid\r\nthe same bait both for Du Boung and for Fletcher;--but laid it in\r\nvain. Everybody said that it was a very clean election. "A brewer\r\nstanding, and devil a glass of beer!" said one old elector who had\r\nremembered better things when the borough never heard of a contest.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of his canvass Arthur Fletcher with his gang of\r\nagents and followers behind him met Lopez with his gang in the\r\nstreet. It was probable that they would so meet, and Fletcher had\r\nresolved what he would do when such a meeting took place. He walked\r\nup to Lopez, and with a kindly smile offered his hand. The two men,\r\nthough they had never been intimate, had known each other, and\r\nFletcher was determined to show that he would not quarrel with a man\r\nbecause that man had been his favoured rival. In comparison with that\r\nother matter this affair of the candidature was of course trivial.\r\nBut Lopez who had, as the reader may remember, made some threat about\r\na horsewhip, had come to a resolution of a very different nature. He\r\nput his arms a-kimbo, resting his hands on his hips, and altogether\r\ndeclined the proffered civility. "You had better walk on," he said,\r\nand then stood, scowling, on the spot till the other should pass by.\r\nFletcher looked at him for a moment, then bowed and passed on. At\r\nleast a dozen men saw what had taken place, and were aware that Mr.\r\nLopez had expressed his determination to quarrel personally with Mr.\r\nFletcher, in opposition to Mr. Fletcher\'s expressed wish for amity.\r\nAnd before they had gone to bed that night all the dozen knew the\r\nreason why. Of course there was some one then at Silverbridge clever\r\nenough to find out that Arthur Fletcher had been in love with Miss\r\nWharton, but that Miss Wharton had lately been married to Mr. Lopez.\r\nNo doubt the incident added a pleasurable emotion to the excitement\r\ncaused by the election at Silverbridge generally. A personal quarrel\r\nis attractive everywhere. The expectation of such an occurrence will\r\nbring together the whole House of Commons. And of course this quarrel\r\nwas very attractive in Silverbridge. There were some Fletcherites\r\nand Lopezites in the quarrel; as there were also Du Boungites, who\r\nmaintained that when gentlemen could not canvass without quarrelling\r\nin the streets they were manifestly unfit to represent such a borough\r\nas Silverbridge in Parliament;--and that therefore Mr. Du Boung\r\nshould be returned.\r\n\r\nMr. Gresham was in the town that day, though not till after the\r\noccurrence, and Fletcher could not avoid speaking of it. "The man\r\nmust be a cur," said Gresham.\r\n\r\n"It would make no difference in the world to me," said Arthur,\r\nstruggling hard to prevent signs of emotion from showing themselves\r\nin his face, "were it not that he has married a lady whom I have long\r\nknown and whom I greatly esteem." He felt that he could hardly avoid\r\nall mention of the marriage, and yet was determined that he would say\r\nno word that his brother would call "howling."\r\n\r\n"There has been no previous quarrel, or offence?" asked Gresham.\r\n\r\n"None in the least." When Arthur so spoke he forgot altogether the\r\nletter he had written; nor, had he then remembered it, would he have\r\nthought it possible that that letter should have given offence. He\r\nhad been the sufferer, not Lopez. This man had robbed him of his\r\nhappiness; and, though it would have been foolish in him to make a\r\nquarrel for a grievance such as that, there might have been some\r\nexcuse had he done so. It had taken him some time to perceive that\r\ngreatly as this man had injured him, there had been no injustice done\r\nto him, and that therefore there should be no complaint made by him.\r\nBut that this other man should complain was to him unintelligible.\r\n\r\n"He is not worth your notice," said Mr. Gresham. "He is simply not a\r\ngentleman, and does not know how to behave himself. I am very sorry\r\nfor the young lady;--that\'s all." At this allusion to Emily Arthur\r\nfelt that his face became red with the rising blood; and he felt\r\nalso that his friend should not have spoken thus openly,--thus\r\nirreverently,--on so sacred a subject. But at the moment he said\r\nnothing further. As far as his canvass was concerned it had been\r\nsuccessful, and he was beginning to feel sure that he would be the\r\nnew member. He endeavoured therefore to drown his sorrow in this\r\ncoming triumph.\r\n\r\nBut Lopez had been by no means gratified with his canvass or with\r\nthe conduct of the borough generally. He had already begun to feel\r\nthat the Duchess and Mr. Sprugeon and the borough had thrown him\r\nover shamefully. Immediately on his arrival in Silverbridge a local\r\nattorney had with the blandest possible smile asked him for a cheque\r\nfor L500. Of course there must be money spent at once, and of course\r\nthe money must come out of the candidate\'s pocket. He had known all\r\nthis beforehand, and yet the demand for the money had come upon him\r\nas an injury. He gave the cheque, but showed clearly by his manner\r\nthat he resented the application. This did not tend to bind to him\r\nmore closely the services of those who were present when the demand\r\nwas made. And then, as he began his canvass, he found that he could\r\nnot conjure at all with the name of the Duke, or even with that of\r\nthe Duchess; and was told on the second day by Mr. Sprugeon himself\r\nthat he had better fight the battle "on his own hook." Now his own\r\nhook in Silverbridge was certainly not a strong hook. Mr. Sprugeon\r\nwas still of opinion that a good deal might be done by judicious\r\nmanipulation, and went so far as to suggest that another cheque\r\nfor L500 in the hands of Mr. Wise, the lawyer, would be effective.\r\nBut Lopez did not give the other cheque, and Sprugeon whispered to\r\nhim that the Duke had been too many for the Duchess. Still he had\r\npersevered, and a set of understrappers around him, who would make\r\nnothing out of the election without his candidature, assured him from\r\ntime to time that he would even yet come out all right at the ballot.\r\nWith such a hope still existing he had not scrupled to affirm in his\r\nspeeches that the success of his canvass had been complete. But, on\r\nthe morning of the day on which he met Fletcher in the street, Mr. Du\r\nBoung had called upon him accompanied by two of the Du Boung agents\r\nand by Mr. Sprugeon himself,--and had suggested that he, Lopez,\r\nshould withdraw from the contest, so that Du Boung might be returned,\r\nand that the "Liberal interests" of the borough might not be\r\nsacrificed.\r\n\r\nThis was a heavy blow, and one which Ferdinand Lopez was not the\r\nman to bear with equanimity. From the moment in which the Duchess\r\nhad mentioned the borough to him, he had regarded the thing as\r\ncertain. After a while he had understood that his return must be\r\naccompanied by more trouble and greater expense than he had at first\r\nanticipated;--but still he had thought that it was all but sure. He\r\nhad altogether misunderstood the nature of the influence exercised\r\nby the Duchess, and the nature also of the Duke\'s resolution. Mr.\r\nSprugeon had of course wished to have a candidate, and had allured\r\nhim. Perhaps he had in some degree been ill-treated by the borough.\r\nBut he was a man whom the feeling of injustice to himself would drive\r\nalmost to frenzy, though he never measured the amount of his own\r\ninjustice to others. When the proposition was made to him, he scowled\r\nat them all, and declared that he would fight the borough to the\r\nlast. "Then you\'ll let Mr. Fletcher in to a certainty," said Mr.\r\nSprout. Now there was an idea in the borough that, although all the\r\ncandidates were ready to support the Duke\'s government, Mr. Du Boung\r\nand Mr. Lopez were the two Liberals. Mr. Du Boung was sitting in the\r\nroom when the appeal was made, and declared that he feared that such\r\nwould be the result. "I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do," said Lopez; "I\'ll\r\ntoss up which of us retires." Mr. Sprout, on behalf of Mr. Du Boung,\r\nprotested against that proposition. Mr. Du Boung, who was a gentleman\r\nof great local influence, was in possession of four-fifths of the\r\nLiberal interests of the borough. Even were he to retire Mr. Lopez\r\ncould not get in. Mr. Sprout declared that this was known to all the\r\nborough at large. He, Sprout, was sorry that a gentleman like Mr.\r\nLopez should have been brought down there under false ideas. He had\r\nall through told Mr. Sprugeon that the Duke had been in earnest, but\r\nMr. Sprugeon had not comprehended the position. It had been a pity.\r\nBut anybody who understood the borough could see with one eye that\r\nMr. Lopez had not a chance. If Mr. Lopez would retire Mr. Du Boung\r\nwould no doubt be returned. If Mr. Lopez went to the poll, Mr.\r\nFletcher would probably be the new member. This was the picture as it\r\nwas painted by Mr. Sprout,--who had, even then, heard something of\r\nthe loves of the two candidates, and who had thought that Lopez would\r\nbe glad to injure Arthur Fletcher\'s chances of success. So far he was\r\nnot wrong;--but the sense of the injury done to himself oppressed\r\nLopez so much that he could not guide himself by reason. The idea of\r\nretiring was very painful to him, and he did not believe these men.\r\nHe thought it to be quite possible that they were there to facilitate\r\nthe return of Arthur Fletcher. He had never even heard of Du Boung\r\ntill he had come to Silverbridge two or three days ago. He still\r\ncould not believe that Du Boung would be returned. He thought over\r\nit all for a moment, and then he gave his answer. "I\'ve been brought\r\ndown here to fight, and I\'ll fight it to the last," he said. "Then\r\nyou\'ll hand over the borough to Mr. Fletcher," said Sprout, getting\r\nup and ushering Mr. Du Boung out of the room.\r\n\r\nIt was after that, but on the same day, that Lopez and Fletcher met\r\neach other in the street. The affair did not take a minute, and then\r\nthey parted, each on his own way. In the course of that evening Mr.\r\nSprugeon told his candidate that he, Sprugeon, could not concern\r\nhimself any further in that election. He was very sorry for what had\r\noccurred;--very sorry indeed. It was no doubt a pity that the Duke\r\nhad been so firm. "But,"--and Mr. Sprugeon shrugged his shoulders as\r\nhe spoke,--"when a nobleman like the Duke chooses to have a way of\r\nhis own, he must have it." Mr. Sprugeon went on to declare that any\r\nfurther candidature would be waste of money, waste of time, and waste\r\nof energy, and then signified his intention of retiring, as far as\r\nthis election went, into private life. When asked, he acknowledged\r\nthat they who had been acting with him had come to the same resolve.\r\nMr. Lopez had in fact come there as the Duke\'s nominee, and as the\r\nDuke had no nominee, Mr. Lopez was in fact "nowhere."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose that any man was ever so treated before, since\r\nmembers were first returned to Parliament," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir;--yes, sir; it is a little hard. But, you see, sir,\r\nher Grace meant the best. Her Grace did mean the best, no doubt.\r\nIt may be, sir, there was a little misunderstanding;--a little\r\nmisunderstanding at the Castle, sir." Then Mr. Sprugeon retired, and\r\nLopez understood that he was to see nothing more of the ironmonger.\r\n\r\nOf course there was nothing for him now but to retire;--to shake the\r\ndust off his feet and get out of Silverbridge as quickly as he could.\r\nBut his friends had all deserted him and he did not know how to\r\nretire. He had paid L500, and he had a strong opinion that a portion\r\nat least of the money should be returned to him. He had a keen sense\r\nof ill-usage, and at the same time a feeling that he ought not to run\r\nout of the borough like a whipt dog, without showing his face to any\r\none. But his strongest sensation at this moment was one of hatred\r\nagainst Arthur Fletcher. He was sure that Arthur Fletcher would be\r\nthe new member. He did not put the least trust in Mr. Du Boung. He\r\nhad taught himself really to think that Fletcher had insulted him\r\nby writing to his wife, and that a further insult had been offered\r\nto him by that meeting in the street. He had told his wife that he\r\nwould ask Fletcher to give up the borough, and that he would make\r\nthat request with a horsewhip in his hand. It was too late now to\r\nsay anything of the borough, but it might not be too late for the\r\nhorsewhip. He had a great desire to make good that threat as far as\r\nthe horsewhip was concerned,--having an idea that he would thus lower\r\nFletcher in his wife\'s eyes. It was not that he was jealous,--not\r\njealous according to the ordinary meaning of the word. His wife\'s\r\nlove to himself had been too recently given and too warmly maintained\r\nfor such a feeling as that. But there was a rancorous hatred in his\r\nheart against the man, and a conviction that his wife at any rate\r\nesteemed the man whom he hated. And then would he not make his\r\nretreat from the borough with more honour if before he left he could\r\nhorsewhip his successful antagonist? We, who know the feeling of\r\nEnglishmen generally better than Mr. Lopez did, would say--certainly\r\nnot. We would think that such an incident would by no means redound\r\nto the credit of Mr. Lopez. And he himself, probably, at cooler\r\nmoments, would have seen the folly of such an idea. But anger about\r\nthe borough had driven him mad, and now in his wretchedness the\r\nsuggestion had for him a certain charm. The man had outraged all\r\npropriety by writing to his wife. Of course he would be justified\r\nin horsewhipping him. But there were difficulties. A man is not\r\nhorsewhipped simply because you wish to horsewhip him.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as he was sitting alone, he got a note from Mr.\r\nSprugeon. "Mr. Sprugeon\'s compliments. Doesn\'t Mr. Lopez think an\r\naddress to the electors should appear in to-morrow\'s \'Gazette,\'--very\r\nshort and easy;--something like the following." Then Mr. Sprugeon\r\nadded a very "short and easy letter" to the electors of the borough\r\nof Silverbridge, in which Mr. Lopez was supposed to tell them that\r\nalthough his canvass promised to him every success, he felt that\r\nhe owed it to the borough to retire, lest he should injure the\r\nborough by splitting the Liberal interest with their much respected\r\nfellow-townsman, Mr. Du Boung. In the course of the evening he did\r\ncopy that letter, and sent it out to the newspaper office. He must\r\nretire, and it was better for him that he should retire after some\r\nrecognised fashion. But he wrote another letter also, and sent it\r\nover to the opposition hotel. The other letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   SIR,--\r\n\r\n   Before this election began you were guilty of gross\r\n   impertinence in writing a letter to my wife,--to her\r\n   extreme annoyance and to my most justifiable anger. Any\r\n   gentleman would think that the treatment you had already\r\n   received at her hands would have served to save her from\r\n   such insult, but there are men who will never take a\r\n   lesson without a beating. And now, since you have been\r\n   here, you have presumed to offer to shake hands with me in\r\n   the street, though you ought to have known that I should\r\n   not choose to meet you on friendly terms after what has\r\n   taken place. I now write to tell you that I shall carry a\r\n   horsewhip while I am here, and that if I meet you in the\r\n   streets again before I leave the town I shall use it.\r\n\r\n   FERDINAND LOPEZ.\r\n\r\n   Mr. Arthur Fletcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter he sent at once to his enemy, and then sat late into\r\nthe night thinking of his threat and of the manner in which he\r\nwould follow it up. If he could only get one fair blow at Fletcher\r\nhis purpose, he thought, would be achieved. In any matter of\r\nhorsewhipping the truth hardly ever gets itself correctly known.\r\nThe man who has given the first blow is generally supposed to\r\nhave thrashed the other. What might follow, though it might be\r\ninconvenient, must be borne. The man had insulted him by writing to\r\nhis wife, and the sympathies of the world, he thought, would be with\r\nhim. To give him his due, it must be owned that he had no personal\r\nfear as to the encounter.\r\n\r\nThat night Arthur Fletcher had gone over to Greshamsbury, and on the\r\nfollowing morning he returned with Mr. Gresham. "For heaven\'s sake,\r\nlook at that!" he said, handing the letter to his friend.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever write to his wife?" asked Gresham, when he read it.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I did. All this is dreadful to me;--dreadful. Well;--you know\r\nhow it used to be with me. I need not go into all that; need I?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say a word more than you think necessary."\r\n\r\n"When you asked me to stand for the place I had not heard that he\r\nthought of being a candidate. I wrote and told her so, and told her\r\nalso that had I known it before I would not have come here."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite see that," said Gresham.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not;--perhaps I was a fool. But we needn\'t go into that.\r\nAt any rate there was no insult to him. I wrote in the simplest\r\nlanguage."\r\n\r\n"Looking at it all round I think you had better not have written."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t say so if you saw the letter. I\'m sure you wouldn\'t.\r\nI had known her all my life. My brother is married to her cousin.\r\nOh heavens! we had been all but engaged. I would have done anything\r\nfor her. Was it not natural that I should tell her? As far as the\r\nlanguage was concerned the letter was one to be read at Charing\r\nCross."\r\n\r\n"He says that she was annoyed and insulted."\r\n\r\n"Impossible! It was a letter that any man might have written to any\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\n"Well;--you have got to take care of yourself at any rate. What will\r\nyou do?"\r\n\r\n"What ought I to do?"\r\n\r\n"Go to the police." Mr. Gresham had himself once, when young,\r\nthrashed a man who had offended him and had then thought himself much\r\naggrieved because the police had been called in. But that had been\r\ntwenty years ago, and Mr. Gresham\'s opinions had been matured and,\r\nperhaps, corrected by age.\r\n\r\n"No; I won\'t do that," said Arthur Fletcher.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you ought to do."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t do that."\r\n\r\n"Then take no notice of the letter and carry a fairly big stick. It\r\nshould be big enough to hurt him a good deal, but not to do him any\r\nserious damage." At that moment an agent came in with news of the\r\nman\'s retirement from the contest. "Has he left the town?" asked\r\nGresham. No;--he had not left the town, nor had he been seen by any\r\none that morning. "You had better let me go out and get the stick,\r\nbefore you show yourself," said Gresham. And so the stick was\r\nselected.\r\n\r\nAs the two walked down the street together, almost the first thing\r\nthey saw was Lopez standing at his hotel door with a cutting whip\r\nin his hand. He was at that moment quite alone, but on the opposite\r\nside of the street there was a policeman,--one of the borough\r\nconstables,--very slowly making his way along the pavement. His\r\nmovement, indeed, was so slow that any one watching him would have\r\ncome to the conclusion that that particular part of the High Street\r\nhad some attraction for him at that special moment. Alas, alas! How\r\nage will alter the spirit of a man! Twenty years since Frank Gresham\r\nwould have thought any one to be a mean miscreant who would have\r\ninterposed a policeman between him and his foe. But it is to be\r\nfeared that while selecting that stick he had said a word which was\r\ncausing the constable to loiter on the pavement!\r\n\r\nBut Gresham turned no eye to the policeman as he walked on with his\r\nfriend, and Fletcher did not see the man. "What an ass he is!" said\r\nFletcher,--as he got the handle of the stick well into his hand.\r\nThen Lopez advanced to them with his whip raised; but as he did so\r\nthe policeman came across the street quickly, but very quietly, and\r\nstood right before him. The man was so thoroughly in the way of the\r\naggrieved wretch that it was out of the question that he should touch\r\nFletcher with his whip.\r\n\r\n"Do you usually walk about attended by a policeman?" said Lopez, with\r\nall the scorn which he knew how to throw into his voice.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know that the man was here," said Fletcher.\r\n\r\n"You may tell that to the marines. All the borough shall know what\r\na coward you are." Then he turned round and addressed the street,\r\nbut still under the shadow, as it were, of the policeman\'s helmet.\r\n"This man who presumes to offer himself as a candidate to represent\r\nSilverbridge in Parliament has insulted my wife. And now, because he\r\nfears that I shall horsewhip him, he goes about the street under the\r\ncare of a policeman."\r\n\r\n"This is intolerable," said Fletcher, turning to his friend.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lopez," said Gresham. "I am sorry to say that I must give you\r\nin charge;--unless you will undertake to leave the town without\r\ninterfering further with Mr. Fletcher either by word or deed."\r\n\r\n"I will undertake nothing," said Lopez. "The man has insulted my\r\nwife, and is a coward."\r\n\r\nAbout two o\'clock on the afternoon of that day Mr. Lopez appeared\r\nbefore the Silverbridge bench of magistrates, and was there sworn to\r\nkeep the peace to Mr. Fletcher for the next six months. After that he\r\nwas allowed to leave the town, and was back in London, with his wife\r\nin Belgrave Mansions, to dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nOn the day but one after this the ballot was taken, and at eight\r\no\'clock on the evening of that day Arthur Fletcher was declared to be\r\nduly elected. But Mr. Du Boung ran him very hard.\r\n\r\nThe numbers were--\r\n\r\n\r\n   FLETCHER 315\r\n\r\n   DU BOUNG 308\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Du Boung\'s friends during these two last days had not hesitated\r\nto make what use they could on behalf of their own candidate of the\r\nLopez and Fletcher quarrel. If Mr. Fletcher had insulted the other\r\nman\'s wife, surely he could not be a proper member for Silverbridge.\r\nAnd then the row was declared to have been altogether discreditable.\r\nTwo strangers had come into this peaceful town and had absolutely\r\nquarrelled with sticks and whips in the street, calling each other\r\nopprobrious names. Would it not be better that they should elect\r\ntheir own respectable townsman? All this was nearly effective. But,\r\nin spite of all, Arthur Fletcher was at last returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nLopez Back in London\r\n\r\n\r\nLopez, as he returned to town, recovered something of his senses,\r\nthough he still fancied that Arthur Fletcher had done him a positive\r\ninjury by writing to his wife. But something of that madness left\r\nhim which had come from his deep sense of injury, both as to the\r\nletter and as to the borough, and he began to feel that he had been\r\nwrong about the horsewhip. He was very low in spirits on this return\r\njourney. The money which he had spent had been material to him, and\r\nthe loss of it for the moment left him nearly bare. While he had had\r\nbefore his eyes the hope of being a member of Parliament he had been\r\nable to buoy himself up. The position itself would have gone very far\r\nwith Sexty Parker, and would, he thought, have had some effect even\r\nwith his father-in-law. But now he was returning a beaten man. Who\r\nis there that has not felt that fall from high hope to utter despair\r\nwhich comes from some single failure? As he thought of this he\r\nwas conscious that his anger had led him into great imprudence at\r\nSilverbridge. He had not been circumspect, as it specially behoved a\r\nman to be surrounded by such difficulties as his. All his life he had\r\nbeen schooling his temper so as to keep it under control,--sometimes\r\nwith great difficulty, but always with a consciousness that in\r\nhis life everything might depend on it. Now he had, alas, allowed\r\nit to get the better of him. No doubt he had been insulted;--but,\r\nnevertheless, he had been wrong to speak of a horsewhip.\r\n\r\nHis one great object must now be to conciliate his father-in-law,\r\nand he had certainly increased his difficulty in doing this by his\r\nsquabble down at Silverbridge. Of course the whole thing would be\r\nreported in the London papers, and of course the story would be told\r\nagainst him, as the respectabilities of the town had been opposed to\r\nhim. But he knew himself to be clever, and he still hoped that he\r\nmight overcome these difficulties. Then it occurred to him that\r\nin doing this he must take care to have his wife entirely on his\r\nside. He did not doubt her love; he did not in the least doubt her\r\nrectitude;--but there was the lamentable fact that she thought\r\nwell of Arthur Fletcher. It might be that he had been a little too\r\nimperious with his wife. It suited his disposition to be imperious\r\nwithin his own household;--to be imperious out of it, if that were\r\npossible;--but he was conscious of having had a fall at Silverbridge,\r\nand he must for a while take in some sail.\r\n\r\nHe had telegraphed to her, acquainting her with his defeat, and\r\ntelling her to expect his return. "Oh, Ferdinand," she said, "I am so\r\nunhappy about this. It has made me so wretched!"\r\n\r\n"Better luck next time," he said with his sweetest smile. "It is\r\nno good groaning over spilt milk. They haven\'t treated me really\r\nwell,--have they?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose not,--though I do not quite understand it all."\r\n\r\nHe was burning to abuse Arthur Fletcher, but he abstained. He would\r\nabstain at any rate for the present moment. "Dukes and duchesses are\r\nno doubt very grand people," he said, "but it is a pity they should\r\nnot know how to behave honestly, as they expect others to behave to\r\nthem. The Duchess has thrown me over in the most infernal way. I\r\nreally can\'t understand it. When I think of it I am lost in wonder.\r\nThe truth, I suppose, is, that there has been some quarrel between\r\nhim and her."\r\n\r\n"Who will get in?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Du Boung, no doubt." He did not think so, but he could not bring\r\nhimself to declare the success of his enemy to her. "The people\r\nthere know him. Your old friend is as much a stranger there as I am.\r\nBy-the-way, he and I had a little row in the place."\r\n\r\n"A row, Ferdinand!"\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t look like that, my pet. I haven\'t killed him. But he\r\ncame up to speak to me in the street, and I told him what I thought\r\nabout his writing to you." On hearing this Emily looked very\r\nwretched. "I could not restrain myself from doing that. Come;--you\r\nmust admit that he shouldn\'t have written."\r\n\r\n"He meant it in kindness."\r\n\r\n"Then he shouldn\'t have meant it. Just think of it. Suppose that I\r\nhad been making up to any girl,--which by-the-by I never did but to\r\none in my life,"--then he put his arm round her waist and kissed her,\r\n"and she were to have married some one else. What would have been\r\nsaid of me if I had begun to correspond with her immediately? Don\'t\r\nsuppose I am blaming you, dear."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I do not suppose that," said Emily.\r\n\r\n"But you must admit that it were rather strong." He paused, but she\r\nsaid nothing. "Only I suppose you can bring yourself to admit nothing\r\nagainst him. However, so it was. There was a row, and a policeman\r\ncame up, and they made me give a promise that I didn\'t mean to shoot\r\nhim or anything of that kind." As she heard this she turned pale, but\r\nsaid nothing. "Of course I didn\'t want to shoot him. I wished him to\r\nknow what I thought about it, and I told him. I hate to trouble you\r\nwith all this, but I couldn\'t bear that you shouldn\'t know it all."\r\n\r\n"It is very sad!"\r\n\r\n"Sad enough! I have had plenty to bear, I can tell you. Everybody\r\nseemed to turn away from me there. Everybody deserted me." As he said\r\nthis he could perceive that he must obtain her sympathy by recounting\r\nhis own miseries and not Arthur Fletcher\'s sins. "I was all alone\r\nand hardly knew how to hold up my head against so much wretchedness.\r\nAnd then I found myself called upon to pay an enormous sum for my\r\nexpenses."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ferdinand!"\r\n\r\n"Think of their demanding L500!"\r\n\r\n"Did you pay it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. I had no alternative. Of course they took care to\r\ncome for that before they talked of my resigning. I believe it was\r\nall planned beforehand. The whole thing seems to me to have been a\r\nswindle from beginning to end. By heaven, I\'m almost inclined to\r\nthink that the Duchess knew all about it herself!"\r\n\r\n"About the L500!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not the exact sum, but the way in which the thing was to be\r\ndone. In these days one doesn\'t know whom to trust. Men, and women\r\ntoo, have become so dishonest that nobody is safe anywhere. It has\r\nbeen awfully hard upon me,--awfully hard. I don\'t suppose that there\r\nwas ever a moment in my life when the loss of L500 would have been so\r\nmuch to me as it is now. The question is, what will your father do\r\nfor us?" Emily could not but remember her husband\'s intense desire to\r\nobtain money from her father not yet three months since, as though\r\nall the world depended on his getting it,--and his subsequent\r\nelation, as though all his sorrows were over for ever, because the\r\nmoney had been promised. And now,--almost immediately,--he was again\r\nin the same position. She endeavoured to judge him kindly, but a\r\nfeeling of insecurity in reference to his affairs struck her at once\r\nand made her heart cold. Everything had been achieved, then, by a\r\ngift of L3000,--surely a small sum to effect such a result with\r\na man living as her husband lived. And now the whole L3000 was\r\ngone;--surely a large sum to have vanished in so short a time!\r\nSomething of the uncertainty of business she could understand, but a\r\nbusiness must be perilously uncertain if subject to such vicissitudes\r\nas these! But as ideas of this nature crowded themselves into her\r\nmind she told herself again and again that she had taken him for\r\nbetter and for worse. If the worse were already coming she would\r\nstill be true to her promise. "You had better tell papa everything,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n"Had it not better come from you?"\r\n\r\n"No, Ferdinand. Of course I will do as you bid me. I will do anything\r\nthat I can do. But you had better tell him. His nature is such that\r\nhe will respect you more if it come from yourself. And then it is so\r\nnecessary that he should know all;--all." She put whatever emphasis\r\nshe knew how to use upon this word.\r\n\r\n"You could tell him--all, as well as I."\r\n\r\n"You would not bring yourself to tell it to me, nor could I\r\nunderstand it. He will understand everything, and if he thinks that\r\nyou have told him everything, he will at any rate respect you."\r\n\r\nHe sat silent for a while meditating, feeling always and most acutely\r\nthat he had been ill-used,--never thinking for an instant that he had\r\nill-used others. "L3000, you know, was no fortune for your father to\r\ngive you!" She had no answer to make, but she groaned in spirit as\r\nshe heard the accusation. "Don\'t you feel that yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about money, Ferdinand. If you had told me to speak\r\nto him about it before we were married I would have done so."\r\n\r\n"He ought to have spoken to me. It is marvellous how close-fisted\r\nan old man can be. He can\'t take it with him." Then he sat for\r\nhalf-an-hour in moody silence, during which she was busy with\r\nher needle. After that he jumped up, with a manner altogether\r\naltered,--gay, only that the attempt was too visible to deceive even\r\nher,--and shook himself, as though he were ridding himself of his\r\ntrouble. "You are right, old girl. You are always right,--almost. I\r\nwill go to your father to-morrow, and tell him everything. It isn\'t\r\nso very much that I want him to do. Things will all come right again.\r\nI\'m ashamed that you should have seen me in this way;--but I have\r\nbeen disappointed about the election, and troubled about that Mr.\r\nFletcher. You shall not see me give way again like this. Give me a\r\nkiss, old girl."\r\n\r\nShe kissed him, but she could not even pretend to recover herself as\r\nhe had done. "Had we not better give up the brougham?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. For heaven\'s sake do not speak in that way! You do\r\nnot understand things."\r\n\r\n"No; certainly I do not."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that I haven\'t the means of living, but that in my business\r\nmoney is so often required for instant use. And situated as I am at\r\npresent an addition to my capital would enable me to do so much!" She\r\ncertainly did not understand it, but she had sufficient knowledge of\r\nthe world and sufficient common sense to be aware that their present\r\nrate of expenditure ought to be matter of importance to a man who\r\nfelt the loss of L500 as he felt that loss at Silverbridge.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Lopez was at Mr. Wharton\'s chambers early,--so\r\nearly that the lawyer had not yet reached them. He had resolved,--not\r\nthat he would tell everything, for such men never even intend to\r\ntell everything,--but that he would tell a good deal. He must,\r\nif possible, affect the mind of the old man in two ways. He must\r\ningratiate himself;--and at the same time make it understood that\r\nEmily\'s comfort in life would depend very much on her father\'s\r\ngenerosity. The first must be first accomplished, if possible,--and\r\nthen the second, as to which he could certainly produce at any rate\r\nbelief. He had not married a rich man\'s daughter without an intention\r\nof getting the rich man\'s money! Mr. Wharton would understand that.\r\nIf the worst came to the worst, Mr. Wharton must of course maintain\r\nhis daughter,--and his daughter\'s husband! But things had not come to\r\nthe worst as yet, and he did not intend on the present occasion to\r\nrepresent that view of his affairs to his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton when he entered his chambers found Lopez seated there. He\r\nwas himself at this moment very unhappy. He had renewed his quarrel\r\nwith Everett,--or Everett rather had renewed the quarrel with him.\r\nThere had been words between them about money lost at cards. Hard\r\nwords had been used, and Everett had told his father that if either\r\nof them were a gambler it was not he. Mr. Wharton had resented this\r\nbitterly and had driven his son from his presence,--and now the\r\nquarrel made him very wretched. He certainly was sorry that he\r\nhad called his son a gambler, but his son had been, as he thought,\r\ninexcusable in the retort which he had made. He was a man to whom\r\nhis friends gave credit for much sternness;--but still he was one\r\nwho certainly had no happiness in the world independent of his\r\nchildren. His daughter had left him, not, as he thought, under happy\r\nauspices,--and he was now, at this moment, soft-hearted and tender in\r\nhis regards as to her. What was there in the world for him but his\r\nchildren? And now he felt himself to be alone and destitute. He was\r\nalready tired of whist at the Eldon. That which had been a delight to\r\nhim once or twice a week, became almost loathsome when it was renewed\r\nfrom day to day;--and not the less when his son told him that he also\r\nwas a gambler. "So you have come back from Silverbridge?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; I have come back, not exactly triumphant. A man should not\r\nexpect to win always." Lopez had resolved to pluck up his spirit and\r\ncarry himself like a man.\r\n\r\n"You seem to have got into some scrape down there, besides losing\r\nyour election."\r\n\r\n"Oh; you have seen that in the papers already. I have come to tell\r\nyou of it. As Emily is concerned in it you ought to know."\r\n\r\n"Emily concerned! How is she concerned?"\r\n\r\nThen Lopez told the whole story,--after his own fashion, and yet\r\nwith no palpable lie. Fletcher had written to her a letter which\r\nhe had thought to be very offensive. On hearing this, Mr. Wharton\r\nlooked very grave, and asked for the letter. Lopez said that he had\r\ndestroyed it, not thinking that such a document should be preserved.\r\nThen he went on to explain that it had had reference to the election,\r\nand that he had thought it to be highly improper that Fletcher should\r\nwrite to his wife on that or on any other subject. "It depends very\r\nmuch on the letter," said the old man.\r\n\r\n"But on any subject,--after what has passed."\r\n\r\n"They were very old friends."\r\n\r\n"Of course I will not argue with you, Mr. Wharton; but I own that it\r\nangered me. It angered me very much,--very much indeed. I took it to\r\nbe an insult to her, and when he accosted me in the street down at\r\nSilverbridge I told him so. I may not have been very wise, but I did\r\nit on her behalf. Surely you can understand that such a letter might\r\nmake a man angry."\r\n\r\n"What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"That he would do anything for her sake,--even retire from\r\nSilverbridge if his friends would let him." Mr. Wharton scratched his\r\nhead, and Lopez saw that he was perplexed. "Should he have offered to\r\ndo anything for her sake, after what had passed?"\r\n\r\n"I know the man so well," said Mr. Wharton, "that I cannot and do not\r\nbelieve him to have harboured an improper thought in reference to my\r\nchild."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it was an indiscretion only."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so. I cannot say. And then they took you before the\r\nmagistrates?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--in my anger I had threatened him. Then there was a policeman\r\nand a row. And I had to swear that I would not hurt him. Of course I\r\nhave no wish to hurt him."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it ruined your chance at Silverbridge?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose it did." This was a lie, as Lopez had retired before the\r\nrow took place. "What I care for most now is that you should not\r\nthink that I have misbehaved myself."\r\n\r\nThe story had been told very well, and Mr. Wharton was almost\r\ndisposed to sympathise with his son-in-law. That Arthur Fletcher had\r\nmeant nothing that could be regarded as offensive to his daughter he\r\nwas quite sure;--but it might be that in making an offer intended to\r\nbe generous he had used language which the condition of the persons\r\nconcerned made indiscreet. "I suppose," he said, "that you spent\r\na lot of money at Silverbridge?" This gave Lopez the opening that\r\nhe wanted, and he described the manner in which the L500 had been\r\nextracted from him. "You can\'t play that game for nothing," said Mr.\r\nWharton.\r\n\r\n"And just at present I could very ill afford it. I should not have\r\ndone it had I not felt it a pity to neglect such a chance of rising\r\nin the world. After all, a seat in the British House of Commons is an\r\nhonour."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--yes;--yes."\r\n\r\n"And the Duchess, when she spoke to me about it, was so certain."\r\n\r\n"I will pay the L500," said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, that is generous!" Then he got up and took the old man\'s\r\nhands. "Some day, when you are at liberty, I hope that you will allow\r\nme to explain to you the exact state of my affairs. When I wrote\r\nto you from Como I told you that I would wish to do so. You do not\r\nobject?"\r\n\r\n"No;" said the lawyer,--but with infinite hesitation in his voice.\r\n"No; I don\'t object. But I do not know how I could serve them. I\r\nshall be busy just now, but I will give you the cheque. And if you\r\nand Emily have nothing better to do, come and dine to-morrow." Lopez\r\nwith real tears in his eyes took the cheque, and promised to come on\r\nthe morrow. "And in the meantime I wish you would see Everett." Of\r\ncourse he promised that he would see Everett.\r\n\r\nAgain he was exalted, on this occasion not so much by the acquisition\r\nof the money as by the growing conviction that his father-in-law was\r\na cow capable of being milked. And the quarrel between Everett and\r\nhis father might clearly be useful to him. He might either serve the\r\nold man by reducing Everett to proper submission, or he might manage\r\nto creep into the empty space which the son\'s defection would make\r\nin the father\'s heart and the father\'s life. He might at any rate\r\nmake himself necessary to the old man, and become such a part of the\r\nhousehold in Manchester Square as to be indispensable. Then the old\r\nman would every day become older and more in want of assistance. He\r\nthought that he saw the way to worm himself into confidence, and,\r\nsoon, into possession. The old man was not a man of iron as he had\r\nfeared, but quite human, and if properly managed, soft and malleable.\r\n\r\nHe saw Sexty Parker in the city that day, and used his cheque for\r\nL500 in some triumphant way, partly cajoling and partly bullying his\r\npoor victim. To Sexty also he had to tell his own story about the row\r\ndown at Silverbridge. He had threatened to thrash the fellow in the\r\nstreet, and the fellow had not dared to come out of his house without\r\na policeman. Yes;--he had lost his election. The swindling of those\r\nfellows at Silverbridge had been too much for him. But he flattered\r\nhimself that he had got the better of Master Fletcher. That was the\r\ntone in which he told the story to his friend in the city.\r\n\r\nThen, before dinner, he found Everett at the club. Everett Wharton\r\nwas to be found there now almost every day. His excuse to himself lay\r\nin the political character of the institution. The club intended to\r\ndo great things,--to find Liberal candidates for all the boroughs and\r\ncounties in England which were not hitherto furnished, and then to\r\nsupply the candidates with money. Such was the great purpose of the\r\nProgress. It had not as yet sent out many candidates or collected\r\nmuch money. As yet it was, politically, almost quiescent. And\r\ntherefore Everett Wharton, whose sense of duty took him there, spent\r\nhis afternoons either in the whist-room or at the billiard-table.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Silverbridge row had to be told again, and was told\r\nnearly with the same incidents as had been narrated to the father.\r\nHe could of course abuse Arthur Fletcher more roundly, and be more\r\nconfident in his assertion that Fletcher had insulted his wife. But\r\nhe came as quickly as he could to the task which he had on hand.\r\n"What\'s all this between you and your father?"\r\n\r\n"Simply this. I sometimes play a game of whist, and therefore he\r\ncalled me a gambler. Then I reminded him that he also sometimes\r\nplayed a game of whist, and I asked him what deduction was to be\r\ndrawn."\r\n\r\n"He is awfully angry with you."\r\n\r\n"Of course I was a fool. My father has the whip-hand of me, because\r\nhe has money and I have none, and it was simply kicking against the\r\npricks to speak as I did. And then too there isn\'t a fellow in London\r\nhas a higher respect for his father than I have, nor yet a warmer\r\naffection. But it is hard to be driven in that way. Gambler is a\r\nnasty word."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is; very nasty. But I suppose a man does gamble when he\r\nloses so much money that he has to ask his father to pay it for him."\r\n\r\n"If he does so often, he gambles. I never asked him for money to pay\r\nwhat I had lost before in my life."\r\n\r\n"I wonder you told him."\r\n\r\n"I never lie to him, and he ought to know that. But he is just the\r\nman to be harder to his own son than to anybody else in the world.\r\nWhat does he want me to do now?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he wants you to do anything," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Did he send you to me?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--no; I can\'t say that he did. I told him I should see you as a\r\nmatter of course, and he said something rough,--about your being an\r\nass."\r\n\r\n"I dare say he did."\r\n\r\n"But if you ask me," said Lopez, "I think he would take it kindly of\r\nyou if you were to go and see him. Come and dine to-day, just as if\r\nnothing had happened."\r\n\r\n"I could not do that,--unless he asked me."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say that he asked you, Everett. I would say so, in spite\r\nof its being a lie, if I didn\'t fear that your father might say\r\nsomething unkind, so that the lie would be detected by both of you."\r\n\r\n"And yet you ask me to go and dine there!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. It\'s only going away if he does cut up rough. And if he\r\ntakes it well,--why then,--the whole thing is done."\r\n\r\n"If he wants me, he can ask me."\r\n\r\n"You talk about it, my boy, just as if a father were the same as\r\nanybody else. If I had a father with a lot of money, by George he\r\nshould knock me about with his stick if he liked, and I would be just\r\nthe same the next day."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately I am of a stiffer nature," said Everett, taking some\r\npride to himself for his stiffness, and being perhaps as little\r\n"stiff" as any young man of his day.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after dinner in Manchester Square, the conversation\r\nbetween the father-in-law and the son-in-law turned almost\r\nexclusively on the son and brother-in-law. Little or nothing was\r\nsaid about the election, and the name of Arthur Fletcher was not\r\nmentioned. But out of his full heart the father spoke. He was\r\nwretched about Everett. Did Everett mean to cut him? "He wants you to\r\nwithdraw some name you called him," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Withdraw some name,--as he might ask some hot-headed fellow to do,\r\nof his own age, like himself; some fellow that he had quarrelled\r\nwith! Does he expect his father to send him a written apology? He had\r\nbeen gambling, and I told him that he was a gambler. Is that too much\r\nfor a father to say?" Lopez shrugged his shoulders, and declared that\r\nit was a pity. "He will break my heart if he goes on like this," said\r\nthe old man.\r\n\r\n"I asked him to come and dine to-day, but he didn\'t seem to like it."\r\n\r\n"Like it! No. He likes nothing but that infernal club."\r\n\r\nWhen the evening was over Lopez felt that he had done a good stroke\r\nof work. He had not exactly made up his mind to keep the father and\r\nson apart. That was not a part of his strategy,--at any rate as yet.\r\nBut he did intend to make himself necessary to the old man,--to\r\nbecome the old man\'s son, and if possible the favourite son. And now\r\nhe thought that he had already done much towards the achievement of\r\nhis object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nThe Jolly Blackbird\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was great triumph at Longbarns when the news of Arthur\'s\r\nvictory reached the place;--and when he arrived there himself with\r\nhis friend, Mr. Gresham, he was received as a conquering hero. But\r\nof course the tidings of "the row" had gone before him, and it was\r\nnecessary that both he and Mr. Gresham should tell the story;--nor\r\ncould it be told privately. Sir Alured Wharton was there, and Mrs.\r\nFletcher. The old lady had heard of the row, and of course required\r\nto be told all the particulars. This was not pleasant to the hero, as\r\nin talking of the man it was impossible for them not to talk of the\r\nman\'s wife. "What a terrible misfortune for poor Mr. Wharton," said\r\nthe old lady, nodding her head at Sir Alured. Sir Alured sighed and\r\nsaid nothing. Certainly a terrible misfortune, and one which affected\r\nmore or less the whole family of Whartons!\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that he was going to attack Arthur with a whip?"\r\nasked John Fletcher.\r\n\r\n"I only know that he was standing there with a whip in his hand,"\r\nsaid Mr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"I think he would have had the worst of that."\r\n\r\n"You would have laughed," said Arthur, "to see me walking\r\nmajestically along the High Street with a cudgel which Gresham had\r\njust bought for me as being of the proper medium size. I don\'t doubt\r\nhe meant to have a fight. And then you should have seen the policeman\r\nsloping over and putting himself in the way. I never quite understood\r\nwhere that policeman came from."\r\n\r\n"They are very well off for policemen in Silverbridge," said Gresham.\r\n"They\'ve always got them going about."\r\n\r\n"He must be mad," said John.\r\n\r\n"Poor unfortunate young woman!" said Mrs. Fletcher, holding up both\r\nher hands. "I must say that I cannot but blame Mr. Wharton. If he had\r\nbeen firm, it never would have come to that. I wonder whether he ever\r\nsees him."\r\n\r\n"Of course he does," said John. "Why shouldn\'t he see him? You\'d see\r\nhim if he\'d married a daughter of yours."\r\n\r\n"Never!" exclaimed the old woman. "If I had had a child so lost to\r\nall respect as that, I do not say that I would not have seen her.\r\nHuman nature might have prevailed. But I would never willingly have\r\nput myself into contact with one who had so degraded me and mine."\r\n\r\n"I shall be very anxious to know what Mr. Wharton does about his\r\nmoney," said John.\r\n\r\nArthur allowed himself but a couple of days among his friends,\r\nand then hurried up to London to take his seat. When there he was\r\nastonished to find how many questions were asked him about "the row,"\r\nand how much was known about it,--and at the same time how little\r\nwas really known. Everybody had heard that there had been a row, and\r\neverybody knew that there had been a lady in the case. But there\r\nseemed to be a general idea that the lady had been in some way\r\nmisused, and that Arthur Fletcher had come forward like a Paladin to\r\nprotect her. A letter had been written, and the husband, ogre-like,\r\nhad intercepted the letter. The lady was the most unfortunate of\r\nhuman beings,--or would have been but for that consolation which she\r\nmust have in the constancy of her old lover. As to all these matters\r\nthe stories varied; but everybody was agreed on one point. All the\r\nworld knew that Arthur Fletcher had gone to Silverbridge, had stood\r\nfor the borough, and had taken the seat away from his rival,--because\r\nthat rival had robbed him of his bride. How the robbery had been\r\neffected the world could not quite say. The world was still of\r\nopinion that the lady was violently attached to the man she had\r\nnot married. But Captain Gunner explained it all clearly to Major\r\nPountney by asserting that the poor girl had been coerced into the\r\nmarriage by her father. And thus Arthur Fletcher found himself almost\r\nas much a hero in London as at Longbarns.\r\n\r\nFletcher had not been above a week in town, and had become heartily\r\nsick of the rumours which in various shapes made their way round to\r\nhis own ears, when he received an invitation from Mr. Wharton to\r\ngo and dine with him at a tavern called the Jolly Blackbird. The\r\ninvitation surprised him,--that he should be asked by such a man\r\nto dine at such a place,--but he accepted it as a matter of course.\r\nHe was indeed much interested in a Bill for the drainage of common\r\nlands which was to be discussed in the House that night; there was\r\na good deal of common land round Silverbridge, and he had some idea\r\nof making his first speech,--but he calculated that he might get his\r\ndinner and yet be back in time for the debate. So he went to the\r\nJolly Blackbird,--a very quaint, old-fashioned law dining-house in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Portugal Street, which had managed not to get\r\nitself pulled down a dozen years ago on behalf of the Law Courts\r\nwhich are to bless some coming generation. Arthur had never been\r\nthere before and was surprised at the black wainscoting, the black\r\ntables, the old-fashioned grate, the two candles on the table, and\r\nthe silent waiter. "I wanted to see you, Arthur," said the old man,\r\npressing his hand in a melancholy way, "but I couldn\'t ask you to\r\nManchester Square. They come in sometimes in the evening, and it\r\nmight have been unpleasant. At your young men\'s clubs they let\r\nstrangers dine. We haven\'t anything of that kind at the Eldon. You\'ll\r\nfind they\'ll give you a very good bit of fish here, and a fairish\r\nsteak." Arthur declared that he thought it a capital place,--the best\r\nfun in the world. "And they\'ve a very good bottle of claret;--better\r\nthan we get at the Eldon, I think. I don\'t know that I can say much\r\nfor their champagne. We\'ll try it. You young fellows always drink\r\nchampagne."\r\n\r\n"I hardly ever touch it," said Arthur. "Sherry and claret are my\r\nwines."\r\n\r\n"Very well;--very well. I did want to see you, my boy. Things haven\'t\r\nturned out just as we wished--have they?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly, sir."\r\n\r\n"No indeed. You know the old saying, \'God disposes it all.\' I have to\r\nmake the best of it,--and so no doubt do you."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt about it, sir," said Arthur, speaking in a low but\r\nalmost angry voice. They were not in a room by themselves, but in a\r\nrecess which separated them from the room. "I don\'t know that I want\r\nto talk about it, but to me it is one of those things for which there\r\nis no remedy. When a man loses his leg, he hobbles on, and sometimes\r\nhas a good time of it at last;--but there he is, without a leg."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t my fault, Arthur."\r\n\r\n"There has been no fault but my own. I went in for the running and\r\ngot distanced. That\'s simply all about it, and there\'s no more to be\r\nsaid."\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t surprised that I should wish to see you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m ever so much obliged. I think it\'s very kind of you."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t go in for a new life as you can. I can\'t take up politics\r\nand Parliament. It\'s too late for me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to. There\'s a Bill coming on this very night that I\'m\r\ninterested about. You mustn\'t be angry if I rush off a little before\r\nten. We are going to lend money to the parishes on the security\r\nof the rates for draining bits of common land. Then we shall sell\r\nthe land and endow the unions, so as to lessen the poor rates, and\r\nincrease the cereal products of the country. We think we can bring\r\n300,000 acres under the plough in three years, which now produce\r\nalmost nothing, and in five years would pay all the expenses. Putting\r\nthe value of the land at L25 an acre, which is low, we shall have\r\ncreated property to the value of seven millions and a half. That\'s\r\nsomething, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Mr. Wharton, who felt himself quite unable to follow\r\nwith any interest the aspirations of the young legislator.\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s complicated," continued Arthur, "but when you come to\r\nlook into it it comes out clear enough. It is one of the instances\r\nof the omnipotence of capital. Parliament can do such a thing, not\r\nbecause it has any creative power of its own, but because it has the\r\ncommand of unlimited capital." Mr. Wharton looked at him, sighing\r\ninwardly as he reflected that unrequited love should have brought a\r\nclear-headed young barrister into mists so thick and labyrinths so\r\nmazy as these. "A very good beefsteak indeed," said Arthur. "I don\'t\r\nknow when I ate a better one. Thank you, no;--I\'ll stick to the\r\nclaret." Mr. Wharton had offered him Madeira. "Claret and brown meat\r\nalways go well together. Pancake! I don\'t object to a pancake. A\r\npancake\'s a very good thing. Now would you believe it, sir; they\r\ncan\'t make a pancake at the House."\r\n\r\n"And yet they sometimes fall very flat too," said the lawyer, making\r\na real lawyer\'s joke.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all in the mixing, sir," said Arthur, carrying it on. "We\'ve\r\nmixture enough just at present, but it isn\'t of the proper sort;--too\r\nmuch of the flour, and not enough of the egg."\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Wharton had still something to say, though he hardly knew how\r\nto say it. "You must come and see us in the Square after a bit."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--of course."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t ask you to dine there to-day, because I thought we should\r\nbe less melancholy here;--but you mustn\'t cut us altogether. You\r\nhaven\'t seen Everett since you\'ve been in town?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. I believe he lives a good deal,--a good deal with--Mr.\r\nLopez. There was a little row down at Silverbridge. Of course it will\r\nwear off, but just at present his lines and my lines don\'t converge."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very unhappy about him, Arthur."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing the matter?"\r\n\r\n"My girl has married that man. I\'ve nothing to say against him;--but\r\nof course it wasn\'t to my taste; and I feel it as a separation. And\r\nnow Everett has quarrelled with me."\r\n\r\n"Quarrelled with you!"\r\n\r\nThen the father told the story as well as he knew how. His son\r\nhad lost some money, and he had called his son a gambler;--and\r\nconsequently his son would not come near him. "It is bad to lose them\r\nboth, Arthur."\r\n\r\n"That is so unlike Everett."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that everybody has changed,--except myself. Who would\r\nhave dreamed that she would have married that man? Not that I have\r\nanything to say against him except that he was not of our sort. He\r\nhas been very good about Everett, and is very good about him. But\r\nEverett will not come to me unless I--withdraw the word;--say that I\r\nwas wrong to call him a gambler. That is a proposition that no son\r\nshould make to a father."\r\n\r\n"It is very unlike Everett," repeated the other. "Has he written to\r\nthat effect?"\r\n\r\n"He has not written a word."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you see him yourself, and have it out with him?"\r\n\r\n"Am I to go to that club after him?" said the father.\r\n\r\n"Write to him and bid him come to you. I\'ll give up my seat if he\r\ndon\'t come to you. Everett was always a quaint fellow, a little idle,\r\nyou know,--mooning about after ideas--"\r\n\r\n"He\'s no fool, you know," said the father.\r\n\r\n"Not at all;--only vague. But he\'s the last man in the world to\r\nhave nasty vulgar ideas of his own importance as distinguished from\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"Lopez says--"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t quite trust Lopez."\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t a bad fellow in his way, Arthur. Of course he is not what\r\nI would have liked for a son-in-law. I needn\'t tell you that. But he\r\nis kind and gentle-mannered, and has always been attached to Everett.\r\nYou know he saved Everett\'s life at the risk of his own." Arthur\r\ncould not but smile as he perceived how the old man was being won\r\nround by the son-in-law, whom he had treated so violently before the\r\nman had become his son-in-law. "By-the-way, what was all that about a\r\nletter you wrote to him?"\r\n\r\n"Emily,--I mean Mrs. Lopez,--will tell you if you ask her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to ask her. I don\'t want to appear to set the wife\r\nagainst the husband. I am sure, my boy, you would write nothing that\r\ncould affront her."\r\n\r\n"I think not, Mr. Wharton. If I know myself at all, or my own nature,\r\nit is not probable that I should affront your daughter."\r\n\r\n"No; no; no. I know that, my dear boy. I was always sure of that.\r\nTake some more wine."\r\n\r\n"No more, thank you. I must be off because I\'m so anxious about this\r\nBill."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t ask Emily about this letter. Now that they are married I\r\nhave to make the best of it,--for her sake. I couldn\'t bring myself\r\nto say anything to her which might seem to accuse him."\r\n\r\n"I thought it right, sir, to explain to her that were I not in the\r\nhands of other people I would not do anything to interfere with her\r\nhappiness by opposing her husband. My language was most guarded."\r\n\r\n"He destroyed the letter."\r\n\r\n"I have a copy of it, if it comes to that," said Arthur.\r\n\r\n"It will be best, perhaps, to say nothing further about it.\r\nWell;--good night, my boy, if you must go." Then Fletcher went off to\r\nthe House, wondering as he went at the change which had apparently\r\ncome over the character of his old friend. Mr. Wharton had always\r\nbeen a strong man, and now he seemed to be as weak as water. As to\r\nEverett, Fletcher was sure that there was something wrong, but he\r\ncould not see his way to interfere himself. For the present he was\r\ndivided from the family. Nevertheless he told himself again and again\r\nthat that division should not be permanent. Of all the world she must\r\nalways be to him the dearest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nThe Horns\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first months of the Session went on very much as the last Session\r\nhad gone. The ministry did nothing brilliant. As far as the outer\r\nworld could see, they seemed to be firm enough. There was no opposing\r\nparty in the House strong enough to get a vote against them on any\r\nsubject. Outsiders, who only studied politics in the columns of their\r\nnewspapers, imagined the Coalition to be very strong. But they who\r\nwere inside, members themselves, and the club quidnuncs who were\r\nalways rubbing their shoulders against members, knew better. The\r\nopposition to the Coalition was within the Coalition itself. Sir\r\nOrlando Drought had not been allowed to build his four ships, and was\r\nconsequently eager in his fears that the country would be invaded\r\nby the combined forces of Germany and France, that India would be\r\nsold by those powers to Russia, that Canada would be annexed to the\r\nStates, that a great independent Roman Catholic hierarchy would be\r\nestablished in Ireland, and that Malta and Gibraltar would be taken\r\naway from us;--all which evils would be averted by the building of\r\nfour big ships. A wet blanket of so terrible a size was in itself\r\npernicious to the Cabinet, and heartrending to the poor Duke. But Sir\r\nOrlando could do worse even than this. As he was not to build his\r\nfour ships, neither should Mr. Monk be allowed to readjust the county\r\nsuffrage. When the skeleton of Mr. Monk\'s scheme was discussed in the\r\nCabinet, Sir Orlando would not agree to it. The gentlemen, he said,\r\nwho had joined the present Government with him, would never consent\r\nto a measure which would be so utterly destructive of the county\r\ninterest. If Mr. Monk insisted on his measure in its proposed form,\r\nhe must, with very great regret, place his resignation in the Duke\'s\r\nhands, and he believed that his friends would find themselves\r\ncompelled to follow the same course. Then our Duke consulted the\r\nold Duke. The old Duke\'s advice was the same as ever. The Queen\'s\r\nGovernment was the main object. The present ministry enjoyed the\r\nsupport of the country, and he considered it the duty of the First\r\nLord of the Treasury to remain at his post. The country was in no\r\nhurry, and the question of suffrages in the counties might be well\r\ndelayed. Then he added a little counsel which might be called quite\r\nprivate, as it was certainly intended for no other ears than those\r\nof his younger friend. "Give Sir Orlando rope enough and he\'ll hang\r\nhimself. His own party are becoming tired of him. If you quarrel with\r\nhim this Session, Drummond, and Ramsden, and Beeswax, would go out\r\nwith him, and the Government would be broken up; but next Session you\r\nmay get rid of him safely."\r\n\r\n"I wish it were broken up," said the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n"You have your duty to do by the country and by the Queen, and you\r\nmustn\'t regard your own wishes. Next Session let Monk be ready with\r\nhis Bill again,--the same measure exactly. Let Sir Orlando resign\r\nthen if he will. Should he do so I doubt whether any one would go\r\nwith him. Drummond does not like him much better than you and I do."\r\nThe poor Prime Minister was forced to obey. The old Duke was his\r\nonly trusted counsellor, and he found himself constrained by his\r\nconscience to do as that counsellor counselled him. When, however,\r\nSir Orlando, in his place as Leader of the House, in answer to some\r\nquestion from a hot and disappointed Radical, averred that the whole\r\nof her Majesty\'s Government had been quite in unison on this question\r\nof the county suffrage, he was hardly able to restrain himself. "If\r\nthere be differences of opinion they must be kept in the background,"\r\nsaid the Duke of St. Bungay. "Nothing can justify a direct\r\nfalsehood," said the Duke of Omnium. Thus it came to pass that the\r\nonly real measure which the Government had in hand was one by which\r\nPhineas Finn hoped so to increase the power of Irish municipalities\r\nas to make the Home Rulers believe that a certain amount of Home Rule\r\nwas being conceded to them. It was not a great measure, and poor\r\nPhineas himself hardly believed in it. And thus the Duke\'s ministry\r\ncame to be called the Faineants.\r\n\r\nBut the Duchess, though she had been much snubbed, still persevered.\r\nNow and again she would declare herself to be broken-hearted, and\r\nwould say that things might go their own way, that she would send in\r\nher resignation, that she would retire into private life and milk\r\ncows, that she would shake hands with no more parliamentary cads and\r\n"caddesses,"--a word which her Grace condescended to coin for her own\r\nuse; that she would spend the next three years in travelling about\r\nthe world; and lastly, that, let there come of it whatever might, Sir\r\nOrlando Drought should never again be invited into any house of which\r\nshe was the mistress. This last threat, which was perhaps the most\r\nindiscreet of them all, she absolutely made good,--thereby adding\r\nvery greatly to her husband\'s difficulties.\r\n\r\nBut by the middle of June the parties at the house in Carlton Terrace\r\nwere as frequent and as large as ever. Indeed it was all party with\r\nher. The Duchess possessed a pretty little villa down at Richmond, on\r\nthe river, called The Horns, and gave parties there when there were\r\nnone in London. She had picnics, and flower parties, and tea parties,\r\nand afternoons, and evenings, on the lawn,--till half London was\r\nalways on its way to Richmond or back again. How she worked! And yet\r\nfrom day to day she swore that the world was ungrateful, and that she\r\nwould work no more! I think that the world was ungrateful. Everybody\r\nwent. She was so far successful that nobody thought of despising\r\nher parties. It was quite the thing to go to the Duchess\'s, whether\r\nat Richmond or in London. But people abused her and laughed at\r\nher. They said that she intrigued to get political support for her\r\nhusband,--and, worse than that, they said that she failed. She\r\ndid not fail altogether. The world was not taken captive as she\r\nhad intended. Young members of Parliament did not become hotly\r\nenthusiastic in support of her and her husband as she had hoped that\r\nthey would do. She had not become an institution of granite, as her\r\ndreams had fondly told her might be possible;--for there had been\r\nmoments in which she had almost thought that she could rule England\r\nby giving dinner and supper parties, by ices and champagne. But in a\r\ndull, phlegmatic way, they who ate the ices and drank the champagne\r\nwere true to her. There was a feeling abroad that "Glencora" was\r\na "good sort of fellow" and ought to be supported. And when the\r\nridicule became too strong, or the abuse too sharp, men would take\r\nup the cudgels for her, and fight her battles;--a little too openly,\r\nperhaps, as they would do it under her eyes, and in her hearing, and\r\nwould tell her what they had done, mistaking on such occasions her\r\ngood humour for sympathy. There was just enough of success to prevent\r\nthat abandonment of her project which she so often threatened, but\r\nnot enough to make her triumphant. She was too clever not to see\r\nthat she was ridiculed. She knew that men called her Glencora among\r\nthemselves. She was herself quite alive to the fact that she herself\r\nwas wanting in dignity, and that with all the means at her disposal,\r\nwith all her courage and all her talent, she did not quite play the\r\npart of the really great lady. But she did not fail to tell herself\r\nthat labour continued would at last be successful, and she was strong\r\nto bear the buffets of the ill-natured. She did not think that she\r\nbrought first-class materials to her work, but she believed,--a\r\nbelief as erroneous as, alas, it is common,--that first-rate results\r\nmight be achieved by second-rate means. "We had such a battle about\r\nyour Grace last night," Captain Gunner said to her.\r\n\r\n"And were you my knight?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I was. I never heard such nonsense."\r\n\r\n"What were they saying?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the old story;--that you were like Martha, busying yourself\r\nabout many things."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I busy myself about many things? It is a pity, Captain\r\nGunner, that some of you men have not something to busy yourselves\r\nabout." All this was unpleasant. She could on such an occasion make\r\nup her mind to drop any Captain Gunner who had ventured to take too\r\nmuch upon himself; but she felt that in the efforts which she had\r\nmade after popularity, she had submitted herself to unpleasant\r\nfamiliarities;--and though persistent in her course, she was still\r\nangry with herself.\r\n\r\nWhen she had begun her campaign as the Prime Minister\'s wife, one\r\nof her difficulties had been with regard to money. An abnormal\r\nexpenditure became necessary, for which her husband\'s express\r\nsanction must be obtained, and steps taken in which his personal\r\nassistance would be necessary;--but this had been done, and there\r\nwas now no further impediment in that direction. It seemed to be\r\nunderstood that she was to spend what money she pleased. There had\r\nbeen various contests between them, but in every contest she had\r\ngained something. He had been majestically indignant with her in\r\nreference to the candidature at Silverbridge,--but, as is usual with\r\nmany of us, had been unable to maintain his anger about two things\r\nat the same time. Or, rather, in the majesty of his anger about her\r\ninterference, he had disdained to descend to the smaller faults of\r\nher extravagance. He had seemed to concede everything else to her,\r\non condition that he should be allowed to be imperious in reference\r\nto the borough. In that matter she had given way, never having\r\nopened her mouth about it after that one unfortunate word to Mr.\r\nSprugeon. But, having done so, she was entitled to squander her\r\nthousands without remorse,--and she squandered them. "It is your\r\nfive-and-twenty thousand pounds, my dear," she once said to Mrs.\r\nFinn, who often took upon herself to question the prudence of all\r\nthis expenditure. This referred to a certain sum of money which\r\nhad been left by the old Duke to Madame Goesler, as she was then\r\ncalled,--a legacy which that lady had repudiated. The money had,\r\nin truth, been given away to a relation of the Duke\'s by the joint\r\nconsent of the lady and of the Duke himself, but the Duchess was\r\npleased to refer to it occasionally as a still existing property.\r\n\r\n"My five-and-twenty thousand pounds, as you call it, would not go\r\nvery far."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of money if you don\'t spend it? The Duke would go\r\non collecting it and buying more property, which always means more\r\ntrouble,--not because he is avaricious, but because for the time\r\nthat comes easier than spending. Supposing he had married a woman\r\nwithout a shilling, he would still have been a rich man. As it is,\r\nmy property was more even than his own. If we can do any good by\r\nspending the money, why shouldn\'t it be spent?"\r\n\r\n"If you can do any good!"\r\n\r\n"It all comes round to that. It isn\'t because I like always to live\r\nin a windmill! I have come to hate it. At this moment I would give\r\nworlds to be down at Matching with no one but the children, and to\r\ngo about in a straw hat and a muslin gown. I have a fancy that I\r\ncould sit under a tree and read a sermon, and think it the sweetest\r\nrecreation. But I\'ve made the attempt to do all this, and it is so\r\nmean to fail!"\r\n\r\n"But where is to be the end of it?"\r\n\r\n"There shall be no end as long as he is Prime Minister. He is the\r\nfirst man in England. Some people would say the first in Europe,--or\r\nin the world. A Prince should entertain like a Prince."\r\n\r\n"He need not be always entertaining."\r\n\r\n"Hospitality should run from a man with his wealth and his position,\r\nlike water from a fountain. As his hand is known to be full, so it\r\nshould be known to be open. When the delight of his friends is in\r\nquestion he should know nothing of cost. Pearls should drop from him\r\nas from a fairy. But I don\'t think you understand me."\r\n\r\n"Not when the pearls are to be picked up by Captain Gunners, Lady\r\nGlen."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t make the men any better,--nor yet the women. They are poor\r\nmean creatures. The world is made up of such. I don\'t know that\r\nCaptain Gunner is worse than Sir Orlando Drought or Sir Timothy\r\nBeeswax. People seen by the mind are exactly different to things seen\r\nby the eye. They grow smaller and smaller as you come nearer down to\r\nthem, whereas things become bigger. I remember when I used to think\r\nthat members of the Cabinet were almost gods, and now they seem to be\r\nno bigger than the shoeblacks,--only less picturesque. He told me the\r\nother day of the time when he gave up going into power for the sake\r\nof taking me abroad. Ah me! how much was happening then,--and how\r\nmuch has happened since that! We didn\'t know you then."\r\n\r\n"He has been a good husband to you."\r\n\r\n"And I have been a good wife to him! I have never had him for an\r\nhour out of my heart since that, or ever for a moment forgotten his\r\ninterest. I can\'t live with him because he shuts himself up reading\r\nblue-books, and is always at his office or in the House;--but I would\r\nif I could. Am I not doing it all for him? You don\'t think that the\r\nCaptain Gunners are particularly pleasant to me! Think of your life\r\nand of mine. You have had lovers."\r\n\r\n"One in my life,--when I was quite entitled to have one."\r\n\r\n"Well; I am Duchess of Omnium, and I am the wife of the Prime\r\nMinister, and I had a larger property of my own than any other young\r\nwoman that ever was born; and I am myself too,--Glencora M\'Cluskie\r\nthat was, and I\'ve made for myself a character that I\'m not ashamed\r\nof. But I\'d be the curate\'s wife to-morrow, and make puddings, if I\r\ncould only have my own husband and my own children with me. What\'s\r\nthe use of it all? I like you better than anybody else, but you do\r\nnothing but scold me." Still the parties went on, and the Duchess\r\nlaboured hard among her guests, and wore her jewels, and stood on\r\nher feet all the night, night after night, being civil to one person,\r\nbright to a second, confidential to a third, and sarcastic to an\r\nunfortunate fourth;--and in the morning she would work hard with\r\nher lists, seeing who had come to her and who had stayed away, and\r\narranging who should be asked and who should be omitted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Duke altogether avoided these things. At\r\nfirst he had been content to show himself, and escape as soon as\r\npossible;--but now he was never seen at all in his own house, except\r\nat certain heavy dinners. To Richmond he never went at all, and in\r\nhis own house in town very rarely even passed through the door that\r\nled into the reception rooms. He had not time for ordinary society.\r\nSo said the Duchess. And many, perhaps the majority of those who\r\nfrequented the house, really believed that his official duties were\r\ntoo onerous to leave him time for conversation. But in truth the\r\nhours went heavily with him as he sat alone in his study, sighing for\r\nsome sweet parliamentary task, and regretting the days in which he\r\nwas privileged to sit in the House of Commons till two o\'clock in the\r\nmorning, in the hope that he might get a clause or two passed in his\r\nBill for decimal coinage.\r\n\r\nIt was at the Horns at an afternoon party, given there in the gardens\r\nby the Duchess, early in July, that Arthur Fletcher first saw Emily\r\nafter her marriage, and Lopez after the occurrence in Silverbridge.\r\nAs it happened he came out upon the lawn close after them, and found\r\nthem speaking to the Duchess as they passed on. She had put herself\r\nout of the way to be civil to Mr. and Mrs. Lopez, feeling that she\r\nhad in some degree injured him in reference to the election, and had\r\ntherefore invited both him and his wife on more than one occasion.\r\nArthur Fletcher was there as a young man well known in the world,\r\nand as a supporter of the Duke\'s Government. The Duchess had taken\r\nup Arthur Fletcher,--as she was wont to take up new men, and had\r\npersonally become tired of Lopez. Of course she had heard of the\r\nelection, and had been told that Lopez had behaved badly. Of Mr.\r\nLopez she did not know enough to care anything, one way or the\r\nother;--but she still encouraged him because she had caused him\r\ndisappointment. She had now detained them a minute on the terrace\r\nbefore the windows while she said a word, and Arthur Fletcher became\r\none of the little party before he knew whom he was meeting. "I am\r\ndelighted," she said, "that you two Silverbridge heroes should meet\r\ntogether here as friends." It was almost incumbent on her to say\r\nsomething, though it would have been better for her not to have\r\nalluded to their heroism. Mrs. Lopez put out her hand, and Arthur\r\nFletcher of course took it. Then the two men bowed slightly to each\r\nother, raising their hats. Arthur paused a moment with them, as they\r\npassed on from the Duchess, thinking that he would say something in\r\na friendly tone. But he was silenced by the frown on the husband\'s\r\nface, and was almost constrained to go away without a word. It was\r\nvery difficult for him even to be silent, as her greeting had been\r\nkind. But yet it was impossible for him to ignore the displeasure\r\ndisplayed in the man\'s countenance. So he touched his hat, and asking\r\nher to remember him affectionately to her father, turned off the path\r\nand went away.\r\n\r\n"Why did you shake hands with that man?" said Lopez. It was the first\r\ntime since their marriage that his voice had been that of an angry\r\nman and an offended husband.\r\n\r\n"Why not, Ferdinand? He and I are very old friends, and we have not\r\nquarrelled."\r\n\r\n"You must take up your husband\'s friendships and your husband\'s\r\nquarrels. Did I not tell you that he had insulted you?"\r\n\r\n"He never insulted me."\r\n\r\n"Emily, you must allow me to be the judge of that. He insulted you,\r\nand then he behaved like a poltroon down at Silverbridge, and I will\r\nnot have you know him any more. When I say so I suppose that will be\r\nenough." He waited for a reply, but she said nothing. "I ask you to\r\ntell me that you will obey me in this."\r\n\r\n"Of course he will not come to my house, nor should I think of going\r\nto his, if you disapproved."\r\n\r\n"Going to his house! He is unmarried."\r\n\r\n"Supposing he had a wife! Ferdinand, perhaps it will be better that\r\nyou and I should not talk about him."\r\n\r\n"By G----," said Lopez, "there shall be no subject on which I will be\r\nafraid to talk to my own wife. I insist on your assuring me that you\r\nwill never speak to him again."\r\n\r\nHe had taken her along one of the upper walks because it was\r\ndesolate, and he could there speak to her, as he thought, without\r\nbeing heard. She had, almost unconsciously, made a faint attempt\r\nto lead him down upon the lawn, no doubt feeling averse to private\r\nconversation at the moment; but he had persevered, and had resented\r\nthe little effort. The idea in his mind that she was unwilling\r\nto hear him abuse Arthur Fletcher, unwilling to renounce the man,\r\nanxious to escape his order for such renunciation, added fuel to his\r\njealousy. It was not enough for him that she had rejected this man\r\nand had accepted him. The man had been her lover, and she should be\r\nmade to denounce the man. It might be necessary for him to control\r\nhis feelings before old Wharton;--but he knew enough of his wife to\r\nbe sure that she would not speak evil of him or betray him to her\r\nfather. Her loyalty to him, which he could understand though not\r\nappreciate, enabled him to be a tyrant to her. So now he repeated his\r\norder to her, pausing in the path, with a voice unintentionally loud,\r\nand frowning down upon her as he spoke. "You must tell me, Emily,\r\nthat you will never speak to him again."\r\n\r\nShe was silent, looking up into his face, not with tremulous eyes,\r\nbut with infinite woe written in them, had he been able to read the\r\nwriting. She knew that he was disgracing himself, and yet he was\r\nthe man whom she loved! "If you bid me not to speak to him, I will\r\nnot;--but he must know the reason why."\r\n\r\n"He shall know nothing from you. You do not mean to say that you\r\nwould write to him?"\r\n\r\n"Papa must tell him."\r\n\r\n"I will not have it so. In this matter, Emily, I will be master,--as\r\nit is fit that I should be. I will not have you talk to your father\r\nabout Mr. Fletcher."\r\n\r\n"Why not, Ferdinand?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have so decided. He is an old family friend. I can\r\nunderstand that, and do not therefore wish to interfere between him\r\nand your father. But he has taken upon himself to write an insolent\r\nletter to you as my wife, and to interfere in my affairs. As to what\r\nshould be done between you and him I must be the judge, and not your\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"And must I not speak to papa about it?"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Ferdinand, you make too little, I think, of the associations and\r\naffections of a whole life."\r\n\r\n"I will hear nothing about affection," he said angrily.\r\n\r\n"You cannot mean that--that--you doubt me?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. I think too much of myself and too little of him." It\r\ndid not occur to him to tell her that he thought too well of her for\r\nthat. "But the man who has offended me must be held to have offended\r\nyou also."\r\n\r\n"You might say the same if it were my father."\r\n\r\nHe paused at this, but only for a moment. "Certainly I might. It is\r\nnot probable, but no doubt I might do so. If your father were to\r\nquarrel with me, you would not, I suppose, hesitate between us?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth could divide me from you."\r\n\r\n"Nor me from you. In this very matter I am only taking your part,\r\nif you did but know it." They had now passed on, and had met other\r\npersons, having made their way through a little shrubbery on to a\r\nfurther lawn; and she had hoped, as they were surrounded by people,\r\nthat he would allow the matter to drop. She had been unable as yet\r\nto make up her mind as to what she would say if he pressed her hard.\r\nBut if it could be passed by,--if nothing more were demanded from\r\nher,--she would endeavour to forget it all, saying to herself that\r\nit had come from sudden passion. But he was too resolute for such a\r\ntermination as that, and too keenly alive to the expediency of making\r\nher thoroughly subject to him. So he turned her round and took her\r\nback through the shrubbery, and in the middle of it stopped her again\r\nand renewed his demand. "Promise me that you will not speak again to\r\nMr. Fletcher."\r\n\r\n"Then I must tell papa."\r\n\r\n"No;--you shall tell him nothing."\r\n\r\n"Ferdinand, if you exact a promise from me that I will not speak to\r\nMr. Fletcher or bow to him should circumstances bring us together as\r\nthey did just now, I must explain to my father why I have done so."\r\n\r\n"You will wilfully disobey me?"\r\n\r\n"In that I must." He glared at her, almost as though he were going to\r\nstrike her, but she bore his look without flinching. "I have left all\r\nmy old friends, Ferdinand, and have given myself heart and soul to\r\nyou. No woman did so with a truer love or more devoted intention of\r\ndoing her duty to her husband. Your affairs shall be my affairs."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes; rather."\r\n\r\nShe was endeavouring to assure him of her truth, but could understand\r\nthe sneer which was conveyed in his acknowledgement. "But you cannot,\r\nnor can I for your sake, abolish the things which have been."\r\n\r\n"I wish to abolish nothing that has been. I speak of the future."\r\n\r\n"Between our family and that of Mr. Fletcher there has been old\r\nfriendship which is still very dear to my father,--the memory of\r\nwhich is still very dear to me. At your request I am willing to put\r\nall that aside from me. There is no reason why I should ever see\r\nany of the Fletchers again. Our lives will be apart. Should we meet\r\nour greeting would be very slight. The separation can be effected\r\nwithout words. But if you demand an absolute promise,--I must tell my\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"We will go home at once," he said instantly, and aloud. And home\r\nthey went, back to London, without exchanging a word on the journey.\r\nHe was absolutely black with rage, and she was content to remain\r\nsilent. The promise was not given, nor, indeed, was it exacted under\r\nthe conditions which the wife had imposed upon it. He was most\r\ndesirous to make her subject to his will in all things, and quite\r\nprepared to exercise tyranny over her to any extent,--so that her\r\nfather should know nothing of it. He could not afford to quarrel with\r\nMr. Wharton. "You had better go to bed," he said, when he got her\r\nback to town;--and she went, if not to bed, at any rate into her own\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nSir Orlando Retires\r\n\r\n\r\n"He is a horrid man. He came here and quarrelled with the other man\r\nin my house, or rather down at Richmond, and made a fool of himself,\r\nand then quarrelled with his wife and took her away. What fools, what\r\nasses, what horrors men are! How impossible it is to be civil and\r\ngracious without getting into a mess. I am tempted to say that I will\r\nnever know anybody any more." Such was the complaint made by the\r\nDuchess to Mrs. Finn a few days after the Richmond party, and from\r\nthis it was evident that the latter affair had not passed without\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n"Did he make a noise about it?" asked Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"There was not a row, but there was enough of a quarrel to be visible\r\nand audible. He walked about and talked loud to the poor woman. Of\r\ncourse it was my own fault. But the man was clever and I liked him,\r\nand people told me that he was of the right sort."\r\n\r\n"The Duke heard of it?"\r\n\r\n"No;--and I hope he won\'t. It would be such a triumph for him, after\r\nall the fuss at Silverbridge. But he never hears of anything. If two\r\nmen fought a duel in his own dining-room he would be the last man in\r\nLondon to know it."\r\n\r\n"Then say nothing about it, and don\'t ask the men any more."\r\n\r\n"You may be sure I won\'t ask the man with the wife any more. The\r\nother man is in Parliament and can\'t be thrown over so easily--and it\r\nwasn\'t his fault. But I\'m getting so sick of it all! I\'m told that\r\nSir Orlando has complained to Plantagenet that he isn\'t asked to the\r\ndinners."\r\n\r\n"Impossible!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you mention it, but he has. Warburton has told me so."\r\nWarburton was one of the Duke\'s private secretaries.\r\n\r\n"What did the Duke say?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite know. Warburton is one of my familiars, but I didn\'t\r\nlike to ask him for more than he chose to tell me. Warburton\r\nsuggested that I should invite Sir Orlando at once; but there I was\r\nobdurate. Of course, if Plantagenet tells me I\'ll ask the man to come\r\nevery day of the week;--but it is one of those things that I shall\r\nneed to be told directly. My idea is, you know, that they had better\r\nget rid of Sir Orlando,--and that if Sir Orlando chooses to kick over\r\nthe traces, he may be turned loose without any danger. One has little\r\nbirds that give one all manner of information, and one little bird\r\nhas told me that Sir Orlando and Mr. Roby don\'t speak. Mr. Roby is\r\nnot very much himself, but he is a good straw to show which way the\r\nwind blows. Plantagenet certainly sent no message about Sir Orlando,\r\nand I\'m afraid the gentleman must look for his dinners elsewhere."\r\n\r\nThe Duke had in truth expressed himself very plainly to Mr.\r\nWarburton; but with so much indiscreet fretfulness that the discreet\r\nprivate secretary had not told it even to the Duchess. "This kind\r\nof thing argues a want of cordiality that may be fatal to us," Sir\r\nOrlando had said somewhat grandiloquently to the Duke, and the Duke\r\nhad made--almost no reply. "I suppose I may ask my own guests in\r\nmy own house," he had said afterwards to Mr. Warburton, "though in\r\npublic life I am everybody\'s slave." Mr. Warburton, anxious of course\r\nto maintain the unity of the party, had told the Duchess so much as\r\nwould, he thought, induce her to give way; but he had not repeated\r\nthe Duke\'s own observations, which were, Mr. Warburton thought,\r\nhostile to the interests of the party. The Duchess had only smiled\r\nand made a little grimace, with which the private secretary was\r\nalready well acquainted. And Sir Orlando received no invitation.\r\n\r\nIn those days Sir Orlando was unhappy and irritable, doubtful of\r\nfurther success as regarded the Coalition, but quite resolved to pull\r\nthe house down about the ears of the inhabitants rather than to leave\r\nit with gentle resignation. To him it seemed to be impossible that\r\nthe Coalition should exist without him. He too had had moments of\r\nhigh-vaulting ambition, in which he had almost felt himself to be the\r\ngreat man required by the country, the one ruler who could gather\r\ntogether in his grasp the reins of government and drive the State\r\ncoach single-handed safe through its difficulties for the next\r\nhalf-dozen years. There are men who cannot conceive of themselves\r\nthat anything should be difficult for them, and again others who\r\ncannot bring themselves so to trust themselves as to think that they\r\ncan ever achieve anything great. Samples of each sort from time to\r\ntime rise high in political life, carried thither apparently by\r\nEpicurean concourse of atoms; and it often happens that the more\r\nconfident samples are by no means the most capable. The concourse of\r\natoms had carried Sir Orlando so high that he could not but think\r\nhimself intended for something higher. But the Duke, who had really\r\nbeen wafted to the very top, had always doubted himself, believing\r\nhimself capable of doing some one thing by dint of industry, but with\r\nno further confidence in his own powers. Sir Orlando had perceived\r\nsomething of his Leader\'s weakness, and had thought that he might\r\nprofit by it. He was not only a distinguished member of the Cabinet,\r\nbut even the recognised Leader of the House of Commons. He looked out\r\nthe facts and found that for five-and-twenty years out of the last\r\nthirty the Leader of the House of Commons had been the Head of the\r\nGovernment. He felt that he would be mean not to stretch out his hand\r\nand take the prize destined for him. The Duke was a poor timid man\r\nwho had very little to say for himself. Then came the little episode\r\nabout the dinners. It had become very evident to all the world that\r\nthe Duchess of Omnium had cut Sir Orlando Drought,--that the Prime\r\nMinister\'s wife, who was great in hospitality, would not admit the\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty into her house. The doings at Gatherum\r\nCastle, and in Carlton Terrace, and at the Horns were watched much\r\ntoo closely by the world at large to allow such omissions to be\r\notherwise than conspicuous. Since the commencement of the Session\r\nthere had been a series of articles in the "People\'s Banner"\r\nviolently abusive of the Prime Minister, and in one or two of these\r\nthe indecency of these exclusions had been exposed with great\r\nstrength of language. And the Editor of the "People\'s Banner" had\r\ndiscovered that Sir Orlando Drought was the one man in Parliament fit\r\nto rule the nation. Till Parliament should discover this fact, or at\r\nleast acknowledge it,--the discovery having been happily made by the\r\n"People\'s Banner,"--the Editor of the "People\'s Banner" thought that\r\nthere could be no hope for the country. Sir Orlando of course saw\r\nall these articles, and in his very heart believed that a man had\r\nat length sprung up among them fit to conduct a newspaper. The Duke\r\nalso unfortunately saw the "People\'s Banner." In his old happy days\r\ntwo papers a day, one in the morning and the other before dinner,\r\nsufficed to tell him all that he wanted to know. Now he felt it\r\nnecessary to see almost every rag that was published. And he would\r\nskim through them all till he found the lines in which he himself\r\nwas maligned, and then, with sore heart and irritated nerves, would\r\npause over every contumelious word. He would have bitten his tongue\r\nout rather than have spoken of the tortures he endured, but he was\r\ntortured and did endure. He knew the cause of the bitter personal\r\nattacks made on him,--of the abuse with which he was loaded, and of\r\nthe ridicule, infinitely more painful to him, with which his wife\'s\r\nsocial splendour was bespattered. He remembered well the attempt\r\nwhich Mr. Quintus Slide had made to obtain an entrance into his\r\nhouse, and his own scornful rejection of that gentleman\'s overtures.\r\nHe knew,--no man knew better,--the real value of that able Editor\'s\r\nopinion. And yet every word of it was gall and wormwood to him. In\r\nevery paragraph there was a scourge which hit him on the raw and\r\nopened wounds which he could show to no kind surgeon, for which he\r\ncould find solace in no friendly treatment. Not even to his wife\r\ncould he condescend to say that Mr. Quintus Slide had hurt him.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Orlando had come himself. Sir Orlando explained himself\r\ngracefully. He of course could understand that no gentleman\r\nhad a right to complain because he was not asked to another\r\ngentleman\'s house. But the affairs of the country were above private\r\nconsiderations; and he, actuated by public feelings, would condescend\r\nto do that which under other circumstances would be impossible. The\r\npublic press, which was ever vigilant, had suggested that there was\r\nsome official estrangement, because he, Sir Orlando, had not been\r\nincluded in the list of guests invited by his Grace. Did not his\r\nGrace think that there might be seeds of,--he would not quite say\r\ndecay for the Coalition, in such a state of things? The Duke paused a\r\nmoment, and then said that he thought there were no such seeds. Sir\r\nOrlando bowed haughtily and withdrew--swearing at the moment that the\r\nCoalition should be made to fall into a thousand shivers. This had\r\nall taken place a fortnight before the party at the Horns from which\r\npoor Mrs. Lopez had been withdrawn so hastily.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Orlando, when he commenced the proceedings consequent on\r\nthis resolution, did not find all that support which he had expected.\r\nUnfortunately there had been an uncomfortable word or two between him\r\nand Mr. Roby, the political Secretary at the Admiralty. Mr. Roby had\r\nnever quite seconded Sir Orlando\'s ardour in that matter of the four\r\nships, and Sir Orlando in his pride of place had ventured to snub Mr.\r\nRoby. Now Mr. Roby could bear a snubbing perhaps as well as any other\r\nofficial subordinate,--but he was one who would study the question\r\nand assure himself that it was, or that it was not, worth his while\r\nto bear it. He, too, had discussed with his friends the condition\r\nof the Coalition, and had come to conclusions rather adverse to Sir\r\nOrlando than otherwise. When, therefore, the First Secretary sounded\r\nhim as to the expediency of some step in the direction of a firmer\r\npolitical combination than that at present existing,--by which of\r\ncourse was meant the dethronement of the present Prime Minister,--Mr.\r\nRoby had snubbed him! Then there had been slight official\r\ncriminations and recriminations, till a state of things had come to\r\npass which almost justified the statement made by the Duchess to Mrs.\r\nFinn.\r\n\r\nThe Coalition had many component parts, some coalescing without\r\ndifficulty, but with no special cordiality. Such was the condition of\r\nthings between the very conservative Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and\r\nhis somewhat radical Chief Secretary, Mr. Finn,--between probably the\r\nlarger number of those who were contented with the duties of their\r\nown offices and the pleasures and profits arising therefrom. Some\r\nby this time hardly coalesced at all, as was the case with Sir\r\nGregory Grogram and Sir Timothy Beeswax, the Attorney-General and\r\nSolicitor-General;--and was especially the case with the Prime\r\nMinister and Sir Orlando Drought. But in one or two happy cases the\r\nCoalition was sincere and loyal,--and in no case was this more so\r\nthan with regard to Mr. Rattler and Mr. Roby. Mr. Rattler and Mr.\r\nRoby had throughout their long parliamentary lives belonged to\r\nopposite parties, and had been accustomed to regard each other with\r\nmutual jealousy and almost with mutual hatred. But now they had come\r\nto see how equal, how alike, and how sympathetic were their tastes,\r\nand how well each might help the other. As long as Mr. Rattler could\r\nkeep his old place at the Treasury,--and his ambition never stirred\r\nhim to aught higher,--he was quite contented that his old rival\r\nshould be happy at the Admiralty. And that old rival, when he looked\r\nabout him and felt his present comfort, when he remembered how\r\nshort-lived had been the good things which had hitherto come in his\r\nway, and how little probable it was that long-lived good things\r\nshould be his when the Coalition was broken up, manfully determined\r\nthat loyalty to the present Head of the Government was his duty. He\r\nhad sat for too many years on the same bench with Sir Orlando to\r\nbelieve much in his power of governing the country. Therefore, when\r\nSir Orlando dropped his hint Mr. Roby did not take it.\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether it\'s true that Sir Orlando complained to the Duke\r\nthat he was not asked to dinner?" said Mr. Roby to Mr. Rattler.\r\n\r\n"I should hardly think so. I can\'t fancy that he would have the\r\npluck," said Mr. Rattler. "The Duke isn\'t the easiest man in the\r\nworld to speak to about such a thing as that."\r\n\r\n"It would be a monstrous thing for a man to do! But Drought\'s head is\r\nquite turned. You can see that."\r\n\r\n"We never thought very much about him, you know, on our side."\r\n\r\n"It was what your side thought about him," rejoined Roby, "that put\r\nhim where he is now."\r\n\r\n"It was the fate of accidents, Roby, which puts so many of us in our\r\nplaces, and arranges our work for us, and makes us little men or big\r\nmen. There are other men besides Drought who have been tossed up in a\r\nblanket till they don\'t know whether their heads or their heels are\r\nhighest."\r\n\r\n"I quite believe in the Duke," said Mr. Roby, almost alarmed by the\r\nsuggestion which his new friend had seemed to make.\r\n\r\n"So do I, Roby. He has not the obduracy of Lord Brock, nor the\r\nineffable manner of Mr. Mildmay, nor the brilliant intellect of Mr.\r\nGresham."\r\n\r\n"Nor the picturesque imagination of Mr. Daubeny," said Mr. Roby,\r\nfeeling himself bound to support the character of his late chief.\r\n\r\n"Nor his audacity," said Mr. Rattler. "But he has peculiar gifts\r\nof his own, and gifts fitted for the peculiar combination of\r\ncircumstances, if he will only be content to use them. He is a just,\r\nunambitious, intelligent man, in whom after a while the country\r\nwould come to have implicit confidence. But he is thin-skinned and\r\nungenial."\r\n\r\n"I have got into his boat," said Roby, enthusiastically, "and he will\r\nfind that I shall be true to him."\r\n\r\n"There is no better boat to be in at present," said the slightly\r\nsarcastic Rattler. "As to the Drought pinnace, it will be more\r\ndifficult to get it afloat than the four ships themselves. To tell\r\nthe truth honestly, Roby, we have to rid ourselves of Sir Orlando. I\r\nhave a great regard for the man."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say I ever liked him," said Roby.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t talk about liking,--but he has achieved success, and is to\r\nbe regarded. Now he has lost his head, and he is bound to get a fall.\r\nThe question is,--who shall fall with him?"\r\n\r\n"I do not feel myself at all bound to sacrifice myself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know who does. Sir Timothy Beeswax, I suppose, will resent\r\nthe injury done to him. But I can hardly think that a strong\r\ngovernment can be formed by Sir Orlando Drought and Sir Timothy\r\nBeeswax. Any secession is a weakness,--of course; but I think he may\r\nsurvive it." And so Mr. Rattler and Mr. Roby made up their minds that\r\nthe First Lord of the Admiralty might be thrown overboard without\r\nmuch danger to the Queen\'s ship.\r\n\r\nSir Orlando, however, was quite in earnest. The man had spirit enough\r\nto feel that no alternative was left to him after he had condescended\r\nto suggest that he should be asked to dinner and had been refused. He\r\ntried Mr. Roby, and found that Mr. Roby was a mean fellow, wedded,\r\nas he told himself, to his salary. Then he sounded Lord Drummond,\r\nurging various reasons. The country was not safe without more ships.\r\nMr. Monk was altogether wrong about revenue. Mr. Finn\'s ideas about\r\nIreland were revolutionary. But Lord Drummond thought that, upon the\r\nwhole, the present Ministry served the country well, and considered\r\nhimself bound to adhere to it. "He cannot bear the idea of being\r\nout of power," said Sir Orlando to himself. He next said a word to\r\nSir Timothy; but Sir Timothy was not the man to be led by the nose\r\nby Sir Orlando. Sir Timothy had his grievances and meant to have\r\nhis revenge, but he knew how to choose his own time. "The Duke\'s\r\nnot a bad fellow," said Sir Timothy,--"perhaps a little weak, but\r\nwell-meaning. I think we ought to stand by him a little longer. As\r\nfor Finn\'s Irish Bill, I haven\'t troubled myself about it." Then\r\nSir Orlando declared to himself that Sir Timothy was a coward, and\r\nresolved that he would act alone.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of July he went to the Duke at the Treasury,\r\nwas closeted with him, and in a very long narration of his own\r\ndifferences, difficulties, opinions, and grievances, explained to the\r\nDuke that his conscience called upon him to resign. The Duke listened\r\nand bowed his head, and with one or two very gently-uttered words\r\nexpressed his regret. Then Sir Orlando, in another long speech,\r\nlaid bare his bosom to the Chief whom he was leaving, declaring the\r\ninexpressible sorrow with which he had found himself called upon to\r\ntake a step which he feared might be prejudicial to the political\r\nstatus of a man whom he honoured so much as he did the Duke of\r\nOmnium. Then the Duke bowed again, but said nothing. The man had been\r\nguilty of the impropriety of questioning the way in which the Duke\'s\r\nprivate hospitality was exercised, and the Duke could not bring\r\nhimself to be genially civil to such an offender. Sir Orlando went on\r\nto say that he would of course explain his views in the Cabinet, but\r\nthat he had thought it right to make them known to the Duke as soon\r\nas they were formed. "The best friends must part, Duke," he said as\r\nhe took his leave. "I hope not, Sir Orlando; I hope not," said the\r\nDuke. But Sir Orlando had been too full of himself and of the words\r\nhe was to speak, and of the thing he was about to do, to understand\r\neither the Duke\'s words or his silence.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sir Orlando resigned, and thus supplied the only morsel of\r\npolitical interest which the Session produced. "Take no more notice\r\nof him than if your footman was going," had been the advice of the\r\nold Duke. Of course there was a Cabinet meeting on the occasion, but\r\neven there the commotion was very slight, as every member knew before\r\nentering the room what it was that Sir Orlando intended to do. Lord\r\nDrummond said that the step was one to be much lamented. "Very much,\r\nindeed," said the Duke of St. Bungay. His words themselves were false\r\nand hypocritical, but the tone of his voice took away all the deceit.\r\n"I am afraid," said the Prime Minister, "from what Sir Orlando has\r\nsaid to me privately, that we cannot hope that he will change his\r\nmind." "That I certainly cannot do," said Sir Orlando, with all the\r\ndignified courage of a modern martyr.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning the papers were full of the political fact, and\r\nwere blessed with a subject on which they could excercise their\r\nprophetical sagacity. The remarks made were generally favourable to\r\nthe Government. Three or four of the morning papers were of opinion\r\nthat though Sir Orlando had been a strong man, and a good public\r\nservant, the Ministry might exist without him. But the "People\'s\r\nBanner" was able to expound to the people at large that the only\r\ngrain of salt by which the Ministry had been kept from putrefaction\r\nhad been now cast out, and that mortification, death, and corruption,\r\nmust ensue. It was one of Mr. Quintus Slide\'s greatest efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n"Get Round Him"\r\n\r\n\r\nFerdinand Lopez maintained his anger against his wife for more than a\r\nweek after the scene at Richmond, feeding it with reflections on what\r\nhe called her disobedience. Nor was it a make-believe anger. She had\r\ndeclared her intention to act in opposition to his expressed orders.\r\nHe felt that his present condition was prejudicial to his interests,\r\nand that he must take his wife back into favour, in order that he\r\nmight make progress with her father, but could hardly bring himself\r\nto swallow his wrath. He thought that it was her duty to obey him\r\nin everything,--and that disobedience on a matter touching her old\r\nlover was an abominable offence, to be visited with severest marital\r\ndispleasure, and with a succession of scowls that should make her\r\nmiserable for a month at least. Nor on her behalf would he have\r\nhesitated, though the misery might have continued for three months.\r\nBut then the old man was the main hope of his life, and must be made\r\nits mainstay. Brilliant prospects were before him. He had used to\r\nthink that Mr. Wharton was a hale man, with some terribly vexatious\r\nterm of life before him. But now, now that he was seen more closely,\r\nhe appeared to be very old. He would sit half bent in the arm-chair\r\nin Stone Buildings, and look as though he were near a hundred. And\r\nfrom day to day he seemed to lean more upon his son-in-law, whose\r\nvisits to him were continued, and always well taken. The constant\r\nsubject of discourse between them was Everett Wharton, who had not\r\nyet seen his father since the misfortune of their quarrel. Everett\r\nhad declared to Lopez a dozen times that he would go to his father if\r\nhis father wished it, and Lopez as often reported to the father that\r\nEverett would not go to him unless the father expressed such a wish.\r\nAnd so they had been kept apart. Lopez did not suppose that the old\r\nman would disinherit his son altogether,--did not, perhaps, wish it.\r\nBut he thought that the condition of the old man\'s mind would affect\r\nthe partition of his property, and that the old man would surely make\r\nsome new will in the present state of his affairs. The old man always\r\nasked after his daughter, begging that she would come to him, and at\r\nlast it was necessary that an evening should be fixed. "We shall be\r\ndelighted to come to-day or to-morrow," Lopez said.\r\n\r\n"We had better say to-morrow. There would be nothing to eat to-day.\r\nThe house isn\'t now what it used to be." It was therefore expedient\r\nthat Lopez should drop his anger when he got home, and prepare his\r\nwife to dine in Manchester Square in a proper frame of mind.\r\n\r\nHer misery had been extreme;--very much more bitter than he had\r\nimagined. It was not only that his displeasure made her life for\r\nthe time wearisome, and robbed the only society she had of all its\r\ncharms. It was not only that her heart was wounded by his anger.\r\nThose evils might have been short-lived. But she had seen,--she could\r\nnot fail to see,--that his conduct was unworthy of her and of her\r\ndeep love. Though she struggled hard against the feeling, she could\r\nnot but despise the meanness of his jealousy. She knew thoroughly\r\nwell that there had been no grain of offence in that letter from\r\nArthur Fletcher,--and she knew that no man, no true man, would have\r\ntaken offence at it. She tried to quench her judgment, and to silence\r\nthe verdict which her intellect gave against him, but her intellect\r\nwas too strong even for her heart. She was beginning to learn that\r\nthe god of her idolatry was but a little human creature, and that she\r\nshould not have worshipped at so poor a shrine. But nevertheless the\r\nlove should be continued, and, if possible, the worship, though the\r\nidol had been already found to have feet of clay. He was her husband,\r\nand she would be true to him. As morning after morning he left her,\r\nstill with that harsh, unmanly frown upon his face, she would look up\r\nat him with entreating eyes, and when he returned would receive him\r\nwith her fondest smile.\r\n\r\nAt length he, too, smiled. He came to her after that interview with\r\nMr. Wharton and told her, speaking with the soft yet incisive voice\r\nwhich she used to love so well, that they were to dine in the Square\r\non the following day. "Let there be an end of all this," he said,\r\ntaking her in his arms and kissing her. Of course she did not tell\r\nhim that "all this" had sprung from his ill-humour and not from hers.\r\n"I own I have been angry," he continued. "I will say nothing more\r\nabout it now; but that man did vex me."\r\n\r\n"I have been so sorry that you should have been vexed."\r\n\r\n"Well;--let it pass away. I don\'t think your father is looking very\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"He is not ill?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no. He feels the loss of your society. He is so much alone. You\r\nmust be more with him."\r\n\r\n"Has he not seen Everett yet?"\r\n\r\n"No. Everett is not behaving altogether well." Emily was made unhappy\r\nby this and showed it. "He is the best fellow in the world. I may\r\nsafely say there is no other man whom I regard so warmly as I do your\r\nbrother. But he takes wrong ideas into his head, and nothing will\r\nknock them out. I wonder what your father has done about his will."\r\n\r\n"I have not an idea. Nothing you may be sure will make him unjust to\r\nEverett."\r\n\r\n"Ah!--You don\'t happen to know whether he ever made a will?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. He would be sure to say nothing about it to me,--or to\r\nanybody."\r\n\r\n"That is a kind of secrecy which I think wrong. It leads to so much\r\nuncertainty. You wouldn\'t like to ask him?"\r\n\r\n"No;--certainly."\r\n\r\n"It is astonishing to me how afraid you are of your father. He hasn\'t\r\nany land, has he?"\r\n\r\n"Land!"\r\n\r\n"Real estate. You know what I mean. He couldn\'t well have landed\r\nproperty without your knowing it." She shook her head. "It might make\r\nan immense difference to us, you know."\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"If he were to die without a will, any land,--houses and that kind\r\nof property,--would go to Everett. I never knew a man who told his\r\nchildren so little. I want to make you understand these things. You\r\nand I will be badly off if he doesn\'t do something for us."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think he is really ill?"\r\n\r\n"No;--not ill. Men above seventy are apt to die, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ferdinand,--what a way to talk of it!"\r\n\r\n"Well, my love, the thing is so seriously matter-of-fact, that it\r\nis better to look at it in a matter-of-fact way. I don\'t want your\r\nfather to die."\r\n\r\n"I hope not. I hope not."\r\n\r\n"But I should be very glad to learn what he means to do while he\r\nlives. I want to get you into sympathy with me in this matter;--but\r\nit is so difficult."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I sympathise with you."\r\n\r\n"The truth is he has taken an aversion to Everett."\r\n\r\n"God forbid!"\r\n\r\n"I am doing all I can to prevent it. But if he does throw Everett\r\nover we ought to have the advantage of it. There is no harm in saying\r\nas much as that. Think what it would be if he should take it into\r\nhis head to leave his money to hospitals. My G----; fancy what my\r\ncondition would be if I were to hear of such a will as that! If he\r\ndestroyed an old will, partly because he didn\'t like our marriage,\r\nand partly in anger against Everett, and then died without making\r\nanother, the property would be divided,--unless he had bought land.\r\nYou see how many dangers there are. Oh dear! I can look forward and\r\nsee myself mad,--or else see myself so proudly triumphant!" All\r\nthis horrified her, but he did not see her horror. He knew that she\r\ndisliked it, but thought that she disliked the trouble, and that she\r\ndreaded her father. "Now I do think that you could help me a little,"\r\nhe continued.\r\n\r\n"What can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Get round him when he\'s a little down in the mouth. That is the way\r\nin which old men are conquered." How utterly ignorant he was of the\r\nvery nature of her mind and disposition! To be told by her husband\r\nthat she was to "get round" her father! "You should see him every\r\nday. He would be delighted if you would go to him at his chambers. Or\r\nyou could take care to be in the Square when he comes home. I don\'t\r\nknow whether we had not better leave this and go and live near him.\r\nWould you mind that?"\r\n\r\n"I would do anything you would suggest as to living anywhere."\r\n\r\n"But you won\'t do anything I suggest as to your father."\r\n\r\n"As to being with him, if I thought he wished it,--though I had to\r\nwalk my feet off, I would go to him."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no need of hurting your feet. There\'s the brougham."\r\n\r\n"I do so wish, Ferdinand, you would discontinue the brougham. I don\'t\r\nat all want it. I don\'t at all dislike cabs. And I was only joking\r\nabout walking. I walk very well."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. You fail altogether to understand my ideas about\r\nthings. If things were going bad with us, I would infinitely prefer\r\ngetting a pair of horses for you to putting down the one you have."\r\nShe certainly did not understand his ideas. "Whatever we do we must\r\nhold our heads up. I think he is coming round to cotton to me. He is\r\nvery close, but I can see that he likes my going to him. Of course,\r\nas he grows older from day to day, he\'ll constantly want some one to\r\nlean on more than heretofore."\r\n\r\n"I would go and stay with him if he wanted me."\r\n\r\n"I have thought of that too. Now that would be a saving,--without any\r\nfall. And if we were both there we could hardly fail to know what he\r\nwas doing. You could offer that, couldn\'t you? You could say as much\r\nas that?"\r\n\r\n"I could ask him if he wished it."\r\n\r\n"Just so. Say that it occurs to you that he is lonely by himself, and\r\nthat we will both go to the Square at a moment\'s notice if he thinks\r\nit will make him comfortable. I feel sure that that will be the best\r\nstep to take. I have already had an offer for these rooms, and could\r\nget rid of the things we have bought to advantage."\r\n\r\nThis, too, was terrible to her, and at the same time altogether\r\nunintelligible. She had been invited to buy little treasures to make\r\ntheir home comfortable, and had already learned to take that delight\r\nin her belongings which is one of the greatest pleasures of a young\r\nmarried woman\'s life. A girl in her old home, before she is given up\r\nto a husband, has many sources of interest, and probably from day to\r\nday sees many people. And the man just married goes out to his work,\r\nand occupies his time, and has his thickly-peopled world around him.\r\nBut the bride, when the bridal honours of the honeymoon are over,\r\nwhen the sweet care of the first cradle has not yet come to her, is\r\napt to be lonely and to be driven to the contemplation of the pretty\r\nthings with which her husband and her friends have surrounded her. It\r\nhad certainly been so with this young bride, whose husband left her\r\nin the morning and only returned for their late dinner. And now she\r\nwas told that her household gods had had a price put upon them and\r\nthat they were to be sold. She had intended to suggest that she would\r\npay her father a visit, and her husband immediately proposed that\r\nthey should quarter themselves permanently on the old man! She was\r\nready to give up her brougham, though she liked the comfort of it\r\nwell enough; but to that he would not consent because the possession\r\nof it gave him an air of wealth; but without a moment\'s hesitation\r\nhe could catch at the idea of throwing upon her father the burden of\r\nmaintaining both her and himself! She understood the meaning of this.\r\nShe could read his mind so far. She endeavoured not to read the book\r\ntoo closely,--but there it was, opened to her wider day by day, and\r\nshe knew that the lessons which it taught were vulgar and damnable.\r\n\r\nAnd yet she had to hide from him her own perception of himself! She\r\nhad to sympathise with his desires and yet to abstain from doing\r\nthat which his desires demanded from her. Alas, poor girl! She soon\r\nknew that her marriage had been a mistake. There was probably no\r\none moment in which she made the confession to herself. But the\r\nconviction was there, in her mind, as though the confession had\r\nbeen made. Then there would come upon her unbidden, unwelcome\r\nreminiscences of Arthur Fletcher,--thoughts that she would struggle\r\nto banish, accusing herself of some heinous crime because the\r\nthoughts would come back to her. She remembered his light wavy hair,\r\nwhich she had loved as one loves the beauty of a dog, which had\r\nseemed to her young imagination, to her in the ignorance of her early\r\nyears, to lack something of a dreamed-of manliness. She remembered\r\nhis eager, boyish, honest entreaties to herself, which to her had\r\nbeen without that dignity of a superior being which a husband should\r\npossess. She became aware that she had thought the less of him\r\nbecause he had thought the more of her. She had worshipped this other\r\nman because he had assumed superiority and had told her that he\r\nwas big enough to be her master. But now,--now that it was all too\r\nlate,--the veil had fallen from her eyes. She could now see the\r\ndifference between manliness and "deportment." Ah,--that she should\r\never have been so blind, she who had given herself credit for seeing\r\nso much clearer than they who were her elders! And now, though at\r\nlast she did see clearly, she could not have the consolation of\r\ntelling any one what she had seen. She must bear it all in silence,\r\nand live with it, and still love this god of clay that she had\r\nchosen. And, above all, she must never allow herself even to think of\r\nthat other man with the wavy light hair,--that man who was rising in\r\nthe world, of whom all people said all good things, who was showing\r\nhimself to be a man by the work he did, and whose true tenderness she\r\ncould never doubt.\r\n\r\nHer father was left to her. She could still love her father. It might\r\nbe that it would be best for him that she should go back to her old\r\nhome, and take care of his old age. If he should wish it, she would\r\nmake no difficulty of parting with the things around her. Of what\r\nconcern were the prettinesses of life to one whose inner soul was\r\nhampered with such ugliness? It might be better that they should\r\nlive in Manchester Square,--if her father wished it. It was clear\r\nto her now that her husband was in urgent want of money, though of\r\nhis affairs, even of his way of making money, she knew nothing. As\r\nthat was the case, of course she would consent to any practicable\r\nretrenchment which he would propose. And then she thought of other\r\ncoming joys and coming troubles,--of how in future years she might\r\nhave to teach a girl falsely to believe that her father was a good\r\nman, and to train a boy to honest purposes whatever parental lessons\r\nmight come from the other side.\r\n\r\nBut the mistake she had made was acknowledged. The man who could\r\nenjoin her to "get round" her father could never have been worthy of\r\nthe love she had given him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n"Come and Try It"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe husband was almost jovial when he came home just in time to take\r\nhis young wife to dine with their father. "I\'ve had such a day in the\r\ncity," he said, laughing. "I wish I could introduce you to my friend,\r\nMr. Sextus Parker."\r\n\r\n"Cannot you do so?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; not exactly. Of course you\'d like him because he is such a\r\nwonderful character, but he\'d hardly do for your drawing-room. He\'s\r\nthe vulgarest little creature you ever put your eyes on; and yet in a\r\ncertain way he\'s my partner."\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose you trust him?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I don\'t;--but I make him useful. Poor little Sexty! I do\r\ntrust him to a degree, because he believes in me and thinks he can\r\ndo best by sticking to me. The old saying of \'honour among thieves\'\r\nisn\'t without a dash of truth in it. When two men are in a boat\r\ntogether they must be true to each other, else neither will get to\r\nthe shore."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t attribute high motives to your friend."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid there are not very many high motives in the world, my\r\ngirl, especially in the city;--nor yet at Westminster. It can hardly\r\nbe from high motives when a lot of men, thinking differently on every\r\npossible subject, come together for the sake of pay and power. I\r\ndon\'t know whether, after all, Sextus Parker mayn\'t have as high\r\nmotives as the Duke of Omnium. I don\'t suppose any one ever had lower\r\nmotives than the Duchess when she chiselled me about Silverbridge.\r\nNever mind;--it\'ll all be one a hundred years hence. Get ready, for I\r\nwant you to be with your father a little before dinner."\r\n\r\nThen, when they were in the brougham together, he began a course of\r\nvery plain instructions. "Look here, dear; you had better get him to\r\ntalk to you before dinner. I dare say Mrs. Roby will be there, and\r\nI will get her on one side. At any rate you can manage it because\r\nwe shall be early, and I\'ll take up a book while you are talking to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"What do you wish me to say to him, Ferdinand?"\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking of your own proposal, and I am quite sure that\r\nwe had better join him in the Square. The thing is, I am in a little\r\nmess about the rooms, and can\'t stay on without paying very dearly\r\nfor them."\r\n\r\n"I thought you had paid for them."\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes; in one sense I had; but you don\'t understand about\r\nbusiness. You had better not interrupt me now as I have got a good\r\ndeal to say before we get to the Square. It will suit me to give up\r\nthe rooms. I don\'t like them, and they are very dear. As you yourself\r\nsaid, it will be a capital thing for us to go and stay with your\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"I meant only for a visit."\r\n\r\n"It will be for a visit,--and we\'ll make it a long visit." It was odd\r\nthat the man should have been so devoid of right feeling himself as\r\nnot to have known that the ideas which he expressed were revolting!\r\n"You can sound him. Begin by saying that you are afraid he is\r\ndesolate. He told me himself that he was desolate, and you can refer\r\nto that. Then tell him that we are both of us prepared to do anything\r\nthat we can to relieve him. Put your arm over him, and kiss him, and\r\nall that sort of thing." She shrunk from him into the corner of the\r\nbrougham, and yet he did not perceive it. "Then say that you think\r\nhe would be happier if we were to join him here for a time. You\r\ncan make him understand that there would be no difficulty about\r\nthe apartments. But don\'t say it all in a set speech, as though\r\nit were prepared,--though of course you can let him know that you\r\nhave suggested it to me and that I am willing. Be sure to let him\r\nunderstand that the idea began with you."\r\n\r\n"But it did not."\r\n\r\n"You proposed to go and stay with him. Tell him just that. And you\r\nshould explain to him that he can dine at the club just as much as he\r\nlikes. When you were alone with him here, of course he had to come\r\nhome; but he needn\'t do that now unless he chooses. Of course the\r\nbrougham would be my affair. And if he should say anything about\r\nsharing the house expenses, you can tell him that I would do anything\r\nhe might propose." Her father to share the household expenses in his\r\nown house, and with his own children! "You say as much as you can\r\nof all this before dinner, so that when we are sitting below he may\r\nsuggest it if he pleases. It would suit me to get in there next week\r\nif possible."\r\n\r\nAnd so the lesson had been given. She had said little or nothing in\r\nreply, and he had only finished as they entered the Square. She had\r\nhardly a minute allowed her to think how far she might follow, and in\r\nwhat she must ignore, her husband\'s instructions. If she might use\r\nher own judgment she would tell her father at once that a residence\r\nfor a time beneath his roof would be a service to them pecuniarily.\r\nBut this she might not do. She understood that her duty to her\r\nhusband did forbid her to proclaim his poverty in opposition to his\r\nwishes. She would tell nothing that he did not wish her to tell,--but\r\nthen no duty could require her to say what was false. She would make\r\nthe suggestion about their change of residence, and would make it\r\nwith proper affection;--but as regarded themselves she would simply\r\nsay that it would suit their views to give up their rooms if it\r\nsuited him.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton was all alone when they entered the drawing-room,--but,\r\nas Lopez had surmised, had asked his sister-in-law round the corner\r\nto come to dinner. "Roby always likes an excuse to get to his club,"\r\nsaid the old man, "and Harriet likes an excuse to go anywhere." It\r\nwas not long before Lopez began to play his part by seating himself\r\nclose to the open window and looking out into the Square; and\r\nEmily when she found herself close to her father, with her hand in\r\nhis, could hardly divest herself of a feeling that she also was\r\nplaying her part. "I see so very little of you," said the old man\r\nplaintively.\r\n\r\n"I\'d come up oftener if I thought you\'d like it."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t liking, my dear. Of course you have to live with your\r\nhusband. Isn\'t this sad about Everett?"\r\n\r\n"Very sad. But Everett hasn\'t lived here for ever so long."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why he shouldn\'t. He was a fool to go away when he did.\r\nDoes he go to you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--sometimes."\r\n\r\n"And what does he say?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he would be with you at once if you would ask him."\r\n\r\n"I have asked him. I\'ve sent word by Lopez over and over again. If he\r\nmeans that I am to write to him and say that I\'m sorry for offending\r\nhim, I won\'t. Don\'t talk of him any more. It makes me so angry that\r\nI sometimes feel inclined to do things which I know I should repent\r\nwhen dying."\r\n\r\n"Not anything to injure Everett, papa!"\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether he ever thinks that I am an old man and all alone,\r\nand that his brother-in-law is daily with me. But he\'s a fool, and\r\nthinks of nothing. I know it is very sad being here night after night\r\nby myself." Mr. Wharton forgot, no doubt, at the moment, that he\r\npassed the majority of his evenings at the Eldon,--though, had he\r\nbeen reminded of it, he might have declared with perfect truth that\r\nthe delights of his club were not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n"Papa," said Emily, "would you like us to come and live here?"\r\n\r\n"What,--you and Lopez;--here, in the Square?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--for a time. He is thinking of giving up the place in Belgrave\r\nMansions."\r\n\r\n"I thought he had them for--for ever so many months."\r\n\r\n"He does not like them, and they are expensive, and he can give them\r\nup. If you would wish it, we would come here,--for a time." He turned\r\nround and looked at her almost suspiciously; and she,--she blushed as\r\nshe remembered how accurately she was obeying her husband\'s orders.\r\n"It would be such a joy to me to be near you again."\r\n\r\nThere was something in her voice which instantly reassured him.\r\n"Well--;" he said; "come and try it if it will suit him. The house is\r\nbig enough. It will ease his pocket and be a comfort to me. Come and\r\ntry it."\r\n\r\nIt astonished her that the thing should be done so easily. Here\r\nwas all that her husband had proposed to arrange by deep diplomacy\r\nsettled in three words. And yet she felt ashamed of herself,--as\r\nthough she had taken her father in. That terrible behest to "get\r\nround him" still grated on her ears. Had she got round him? Had she\r\ncheated him into this? "Papa," she said, "do not do this unless you\r\nfeel sure that you will like it."\r\n\r\n"How is anybody to feel sure of anything, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"But if you doubt, do not do it."\r\n\r\n"I feel sure of one thing, that it will be a great saving to your\r\nhusband, and I am nearly sure that that ought not to be a matter of\r\nindifference to him. There is plenty of room here, and it will at any\r\nrate be a comfort to me to see you sometimes." Just at this moment\r\nMrs. Roby came in, and the old man began to tell his news aloud.\r\n"Emily has not gone away for long. She\'s coming back like a bad\r\nshilling."\r\n\r\n"Not to live in the Square?" said Mrs. Roby, looking round at Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Why not? There\'s room here for them, and it will be just as well to\r\nsave expense. When will you come, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Whenever the house may be ready, papa."\r\n\r\n"It\'s ready now. You ought to know that. I am not going to refurnish\r\nthe rooms for you, or anything of that kind. Lopez can come in and\r\nhang up his hat whenever it pleases him."\r\n\r\nDuring this time Lopez had hardly known how to speak or what to say.\r\nHe had been very anxious that his wife should pave the way, as he\r\nwould have called it. He had been urgent with her to break the ice\r\nto her father. But it had not occurred to him that the matter would\r\nbe settled without any reference to himself. Of course he had heard\r\nevery word that had been spoken, and was aware that his own poverty\r\nhad been suggested as the cause for such a proceeding. It was a great\r\nthing for him in every way. He would live for nothing, and would also\r\nhave almost unlimited power of being with Mr. Wharton as old age grew\r\non him. This ready compliance with his wishes was a benefit far too\r\nprecious to be lost. But yet he felt that his own dignity required\r\nsome reference to himself. It was distasteful to him that his\r\nfather-in-law should regard him,--or, at any rate, that he should\r\nspeak of him,--as a pauper, unable to provide a home for his own\r\nwife. "Emily\'s notion in suggesting it, sir," he said, "has been her\r\ncare for your comfort." The barrister turned round and looked at\r\nhim, and Lopez did not quite like the look. "It was she thought of\r\nit first, and she certainly had no other idea than that. When she\r\nmentioned it to me, I was delighted to agree."\r\n\r\nEmily heard it all and blushed. It was not absolutely untrue in\r\nwords,--this assertion of her husband\'s,--but altogether false in\r\nspirit. And yet she could not contradict him. "I don\'t see why it\r\nshould not do very well, indeed," said Mrs. Roby.\r\n\r\n"I hope it may," said the barrister. "Come, Emily, I must take you\r\ndown to dinner to-day. You are not at home yet, you know. As you are\r\nto come, the sooner the better."\r\n\r\nDuring dinner not a word was said on the subject. Lopez exerted\r\nhimself to be pleasant, and told all that he had heard as to the\r\ndifficulties of the Cabinet. Sir Orlando had resigned, and the\r\ngeneral opinion was that the Coalition was going to pieces. Had Mr.\r\nWharton seen the last article in the "People\'s Banner" about the\r\nDuke? Lopez was strongly of the opinion that Mr. Wharton ought to see\r\nthat article. "I never had the \'People\'s Banner\' within my fingers in\r\nmy life," said the barrister angrily, "and I certainly never will."\r\n\r\n"Ah, sir; this is an exception. You should see this. When Slide\r\nreally means to cut a fellow up, he can do it. There\'s no one like\r\nhim. And the Duke has deserved it. He\'s a poor, vacillating creature,\r\nled by the Duchess; and she,--according to all that one hears,--she\r\nisn\'t much better than she should be."\r\n\r\n"I thought the Duchess was a great friend of yours," said Mr.\r\nWharton.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care much for such friendship. She threw me over most\r\nshamefully."\r\n\r\n"And therefore, of course, you are justified in taking away her\r\ncharacter. I never saw the Duchess of Omnium in my life, and should\r\nprobably be very uncomfortable if I found myself in her society;\r\nbut I believe her to be a good sort of woman in her way." Emily sat\r\nperfectly silent, knowing that her husband had been rebuked, but\r\nfeeling that he had deserved it. He, however, was not abashed; but\r\nchanged the conversation, dashing into city rumours, and legal\r\nreforms. The old man from time to time said sharp little things,\r\nshowing that his intellect was not senile, all of which his\r\nson-in-law bore imperturbably. It was not that he liked it, or was\r\nindifferent, but that he knew that he could not get the good things\r\nwhich Mr. Wharton could do for him without making some kind of\r\npayment. He must take the sharp words of the old man,--and take all\r\nthat he could get besides.\r\n\r\nWhen the two men were alone together after dinner, Mr. Wharton used a\r\ndifferent tone. "If you are to come," he said, "you might as well do\r\nit as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n"A day or two will be enough for us."\r\n\r\n"There are one or two things you should understand. I shall be very\r\nhappy to see your friends at any time, but I shall like to know when\r\nthey are coming before they come."\r\n\r\n"Of course, sir."\r\n\r\n"I dine out a good deal."\r\n\r\n"At the club," suggested Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Well;--at the club or elsewhere. It doesn\'t matter. There will\r\nalways be dinner here for you and Emily, just as though I were at\r\nhome. I say this, so that there need be no questionings or doubts\r\nabout it hereafter. And don\'t let there ever be any question of money\r\nbetween us."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"Everett has an allowance, and this will be tantamount to an\r\nallowance to Emily. You have also had L3500. I hope it has been well\r\nexpended;--except the L500 at that election, which has, of course,\r\nbeen thrown away."\r\n\r\n"The other was brought into the business."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what the business is. But you and Emily must understand\r\nthat the money has been given as her fortune."\r\n\r\n"Oh, quite so;--part of it, you mean."\r\n\r\n"I mean just what I say."\r\n\r\n"I call it part of it, because, as you observed just now, our living\r\nhere will be the same as though you made Emily an allowance."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--well; you can look at it in that light if you please. John has\r\nthe key of the cellar. He\'s a man I can trust. As a rule I have port\r\nand sherry at table every day. If you like claret I will get some a\r\nlittle cheaper than what I use when friends are here."\r\n\r\n"What wine I have is quite indifferent to me."\r\n\r\n"I like it good, and I have it good. I always breakfast at 9.30.\r\nYou can have yours earlier if you please. I don\'t know that there\'s\r\nanything else to be said. I hope we shall get into the way of\r\nunderstanding each other, and being mutually comfortable. Shall we\r\ngo upstairs to Emily and Mrs. Roby?" And so it was determined that\r\nEmily was to come back to her old house about eight months after her\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton himself sat late into the night, all alone, thinking\r\nabout it. What he had done, he had done in a morose way, and he was\r\naware that it was so. He had not beamed with smiles, and opened his\r\narms lovingly, and, bidding God bless his dearest children, told them\r\nthat if they would only come and sit round his hearth he should be\r\nthe happiest old man in London. He had said little or nothing of his\r\nown affection even for his daughter, but had spoken of the matter as\r\none of which the pecuniary aspect alone was important. He had found\r\nout that the saving so effected would be material to Lopez, and had\r\nresolved that there should be no shirking of the truth in what he was\r\nprepared to do. He had been almost asked to take the young married\r\ncouple in, and feed them,--so that they might live free of expense.\r\nHe was willing to do it,--but was not willing that there should be\r\nany soft-worded, high-toned false pretension. He almost read Lopez to\r\nthe bottom,--not, however, giving the man credit for dishonesty so\r\ndeep or cleverness so great as he possessed. But as regarded Emily,\r\nhe was also actuated by a personal desire to have her back again as\r\nan element of happiness to himself. He had pined for her since he had\r\nbeen left alone, hardly knowing what it was that he had wanted. And\r\nnow as he thought of it all, he was angry with himself that he had\r\nnot been more loving and softer in his manner to her. She at any rate\r\nwas honest. No doubt of that crossed his mind. And now he had been\r\nbitter to her,--bitter in his manner,--simply because he had not\r\nwished to appear to have been taken in by her husband. Thinking of\r\nall this, he got up, and went to his desk, and wrote her a note,\r\nwhich she would receive on the following morning after her husband\r\nhad left her. It was very short.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAREST E.\r\n\r\n   I am so overjoyed that you are coming back to me.\r\n\r\n   A. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had judged her quite rightly. The manner in which the thing had\r\nbeen arranged had made her very wretched. There had been no love in\r\nit;--nothing apparently but assertions on one side that much was\r\nbeing given, and on the other acknowledgments that much was to be\r\nreceived. She was aware that in this her father had condemned her\r\nhusband. She also had condemned him;--and felt, alas, that she also\r\nhad been condemned. But this little letter took away that sting. She\r\ncould read in her father\'s note all the action of his mind. He had\r\nknown that he was bound to acquit her, and he had done so with one of\r\nthe old long-valued expressions of his love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nThe Value of a Thick Skin\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Orlando Drought must have felt bitterly the quiescence with which\r\nhe sank into obscurity on the second bench on the opposite side of\r\nthe House. One great occasion he had on which it was his privilege\r\nto explain to four or five hundred gentlemen the insuperable reasons\r\nwhich caused him to break away from those right honourable friends to\r\nact with whom had been his comfort and his duty, his great joy and\r\nhis unalloyed satisfaction. Then he occupied the best part of an hour\r\nin abusing those friends and all their measures. This no doubt had\r\nbeen a pleasure, as practice had made the manipulation of words easy\r\nto him,--and he was able to revel in that absence of responsibility\r\nwhich must be as a fresh perfumed bath to a minister just freed from\r\nthe trammels of office. But the pleasure was surely followed by much\r\nsuffering when Mr. Monk,--Mr. Monk who was to assume his place as\r\nLeader of the House,--only took five minutes to answer him, saying\r\nthat he and his colleagues regretted much the loss of the Right\r\nHonourable Baronet\'s services, but that it would hardly be necessary\r\nfor him to defend the Ministry on all those points on which it had\r\nbeen attacked, as, were he to do so, he would have to repeat the\r\narguments by which every measure brought forward by the present\r\nMinistry had been supported. Then Mr. Monk sat down, and the business\r\nof the House went on just as if Sir Orlando Drought had not moved his\r\nseat at all.\r\n\r\n"What makes everybody and everything so dead?" said Sir Orlando to\r\nhis old friend Mr. Boffin as they walked home together from the\r\nHouse that night. They had in former days been staunch friends,\r\nsitting night after night close together, united in opposition, and\r\nsometimes, for a few halcyon months, in the happier bonds of office.\r\nBut when Sir Orlando had joined the Coalition, and when the sterner\r\nspirit of Mr. Boffin had preferred principles to place,--to use the\r\nlanguage in which he was wont to speak to himself and to his wife\r\nand family of his own abnegation,--there had come a coolness\r\nbetween them. Mr. Boffin, who was not a rich man, nor by any means\r\nindifferent to the comforts of office, had felt keenly the injury\r\ndone to him when he was left hopelessly in the cold by the desertion\r\nof his old friends. It had come to pass that there had been no\r\nsalt left in the opposition. Mr. Boffin in all his parliamentary\r\nexperience had known nothing like it. Mr. Boffin had been sure that\r\nBritish honour was going to the dogs and that British greatness was\r\nat an end. But the secession of Sir Orlando gave a little fillip to\r\nhis life. At any rate he could walk home with his old friend and talk\r\nof the horrors of the present day.\r\n\r\n"Well, Drought, if you ask me, you know, I can only speak as I feel.\r\nEverything must be dead when men holding different opinions on every\r\nsubject under the sun come together in order that they may carry on a\r\ngovernment as they would a trade business. The work may be done, but\r\nit must be done without spirit."\r\n\r\n"But it may be all important that the work should be done," said the\r\nBaronet, apologising for his past misconduct.\r\n\r\n"No doubt;--and I am very far from judging those who make the\r\nattempt. It has been made more than once before, and has, I think,\r\nalways failed. I don\'t believe in it myself, and I think that\r\nthe death-like torpor of which you speak is one of its worst\r\nconsequences." After that Mr. Boffin admitted Sir Orlando back into\r\nhis heart of hearts.\r\n\r\nThen the end of the Session came, very quietly and very early. By\r\nthe end of July there was nothing left to be done, and the world of\r\nLondon was allowed to go down into the country almost a fortnight\r\nbefore its usual time.\r\n\r\nWith many men, both in and out of Parliament, it became a question\r\nwhether all this was for good or evil. The Boffinites had of course\r\nmuch to say for themselves. Everything was torpid. There was no\r\ninterest in the newspapers,--except when Mr. Slide took the tomahawk\r\ninto his hands. A member of Parliament this Session had not been by\r\nhalf so much bigger than another man as in times of hot political\r\nwarfare. One of the most moving sources of our national excitement\r\nseemed to have vanished from life. We all know what happens to\r\nstagnant waters. So said the Boffinites, and so also now said Sir\r\nOrlando. But the Government was carried on and the country was\r\nprosperous. A few useful measures had been passed by unambitious men,\r\nand the Duke of St. Bungay declared that he had never known a Session\r\nof Parliament more thoroughly satisfactory to the ministers.\r\n\r\nBut the old Duke in so saying had spoken as it were his public\r\nopinion,--giving, truly enough, to a few of his colleagues, such as\r\nLord Drummond, Sir Gregory Grogram and others, the results of his\r\ngeneral experience; but in his own bosom and with a private friend he\r\nwas compelled to confess that there was a cloud in the heavens. The\r\nPrime Minister had become so moody, so irritable, and so unhappy,\r\nthat the old Duke was forced to doubt whether things could go on\r\nmuch longer as they were. He was wont to talk of these things to his\r\nfriend Lord Cantrip, who was not a member of the Government, but\r\nwho had been a colleague of both the Dukes, and whom the old Duke\r\nregarded with peculiar confidence. "I cannot explain it to you," he\r\nsaid to Lord Cantrip. "There is nothing that ought to give him a\r\nmoment\'s uneasiness. Since he took office there hasn\'t once been\r\na majority against him in either House on any question that the\r\nGovernment has made its own. I don\'t remember such a state of\r\nthings,--so easy for the Prime Minister,--since the days of Lord\r\nLiverpool. He had one thorn in his side, our friend who was at the\r\nAdmiralty, and that thorn like other thorns has worked itself out.\r\nYet at this moment it is impossible to get him to consent to the\r\nnomination of a successor to Sir Orlando." This was said a week\r\nbefore the Session had closed.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is his health," said Lord Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"He\'s well enough as far as I can see;--though he will be ill unless\r\nhe can relieve himself from the strain on his nerves."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean by resigning?"\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily. The fault is that he takes things too seriously. If\r\nhe could be got to believe that he might eat, and sleep, and go to\r\nbed, and amuse himself like other men, he might be a very good Prime\r\nMinister. He is over troubled by his conscience. I have seen a good\r\nmany Prime Ministers, Cantrip, and I\'ve taught myself to think that\r\nthey are not very different from other men. One wants in a Prime\r\nMinister a good many things, but not very great things. He should be\r\nclever but need not be a genius; he should be conscientious but by no\r\nmeans strait-laced; he should be cautious but never timid, bold but\r\nnever venturesome; he should have a good digestion, genial manners,\r\nand, above all, a thick skin. These are the gifts we want, but we\r\ncan\'t always get them, and have to do without them. For my own part,\r\nI find that though Smith be a very good Minister, the best perhaps to\r\nbe had at the time, when he breaks down Jones does nearly as well."\r\n\r\n"There will be a Jones, then, if your Smith does break down?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt. England wouldn\'t come to an end because the Duke of Omnium\r\nshut himself up at Matching. But I love the man, and, with some few\r\nexceptions, am contented with the party. We can\'t do better, and it\r\ncuts me to the heart when I see him suffering, knowing how much I did\r\nmyself to make him undertake the work."\r\n\r\n"Is he going to Gatherum Castle?"\r\n\r\n"No;--to Matching. There is some discomfort about that."\r\n\r\n"I suppose," said Lord Cantrip,--speaking almost in a whisper,\r\nalthough they were closeted together,--"I suppose the Duchess is a\r\nlittle troublesome."\r\n\r\n"She\'s the dearest woman in the world," said the Duke of St. Bungay.\r\n"I love her almost as I do my own daughter. And she is most zealous\r\nto serve him."\r\n\r\n"I fancy she overdoes it."\r\n\r\n"No doubt."\r\n\r\n"And that he suffers from perceiving it," said Lord Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"But a man hasn\'t a right to suppose that he shall have no\r\nannoyances. The best horse in the world has some fault. He pulls, or\r\nhe shies, or is slow at his fences, or doesn\'t like heavy ground.\r\nHe has no right to expect that his wife shall know everything and\r\ndo everything without a mistake. And then he has such faults of\r\nhis own! His skin is so thin. Do you remember dear old Brock? By\r\nheavens;--there was a covering, a hide impervious to fire or steel!\r\nHe wouldn\'t have gone into tantrums because his wife asked too many\r\npeople to the house. Nevertheless, I won\'t give up all hope."\r\n\r\n"A man\'s skin may be thickened, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"No doubt;--as a blacksmith\'s arm."\r\n\r\nBut the Duke of St. Bungay, though he declared that he wouldn\'t give\r\nup hope, was very uneasy on the matter. "Why won\'t you let me go?"\r\nthe other Duke had said to him.\r\n\r\n"What;--because such a man as Sir Orlando Drought throws up his\r\noffice?"\r\n\r\nBut in truth the Duke of Omnium had not been instigated to ask the\r\nquestion by the resignation of Sir Orlando. At that very moment\r\nthe "People\'s Banner" had been put out of sight at the bottom of a\r\nheap of other newspapers behind the Prime Minister\'s chair, and his\r\npresent misery had been produced by Mr. Quintus Slide. To have a\r\nfestering wound and to be able to show the wound to no surgeon, is\r\nwretchedness indeed! "It\'s not Sir Orlando, but a sense of general\r\nfailure," said the Prime Minister. Then his old friend had made use\r\nof that argument of the ever-recurring majorities to prove that there\r\nhad been no failure. "There seems to have come a lethargy upon the\r\ncountry," said the poor victim. Then the Duke of St. Bungay knew that\r\nhis friend had read that pernicious article in the "People\'s Banner,"\r\nfor the Duke had also read it and remembered that phrase of a\r\n"lethargy on the country," and understood at once how the poison had\r\nrankled.\r\n\r\nIt was a week before he would consent to ask any man to fill the\r\nvacancy made by Sir Orlando. He would not allow suggestions to be\r\nmade to him and yet would name no one himself. The old Duke, indeed,\r\ndid make a suggestion, and anything coming from him was of course\r\nborne with patience. Barrington Erle, he thought, would do for the\r\nAdmiralty. But the Prime Minister shook his head. "In the first place\r\nhe would refuse, and that would be a great blow to me."\r\n\r\n"I could sound him," said the old Duke. But the Prime Minister again\r\nshook his head and turned the subject. With all his timidity he was\r\nbecoming autocratic and peevishly imperious. Then he went to Lord\r\nCantrip, and when Lord Cantrip, with all the kindness which he could\r\nthrow into his words, stated the reasons which induced him at present\r\nto decline office, he was again in despair. At last he asked Phineas\r\nFinn to move to the Admiralty, and, when our old friend somewhat\r\nreluctantly obeyed, of course he had the same difficulty in filling\r\nthe office Finn had held. Other changes and other complications\r\nbecame necessary, and Mr. Quintus Slide, who hated Phineas Finn\r\neven worse than the poor Duke, found ample scope for his patriotic\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nThis all took place in the closing week of the Session, filling our\r\npoor Prime Minister with trouble and dismay, just when other people\r\nwere complaining that there was nothing to think of and nothing to\r\ndo. Men do not really like leaving London before the grouse calls\r\nthem,--the grouse, or rather the fashion of the grouse. And some\r\nladies were very angry at being separated so soon from their swains\r\nin the city. The tradesmen too were displeased,--so that there were\r\nvoices to re-echo the abuse of the "People\'s Banner." The Duchess had\r\ndone her best to prolong the Session by another week, telling her\r\nhusband of the evil consequences above suggested, but he had thrown\r\nwide his arms and asked her with affected dismay whether he was to\r\nkeep Parliament sitting in order that more ribbons might be sold!\r\n"There is nothing to be done," said the Duke almost angrily.\r\n\r\n"Then you should make something to be done," said the Duchess,\r\nmimicking him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nRetribution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duchess had been at work with her husband for the last two months\r\nin the hope of renewing her autumnal festivities, but had been\r\nlamentably unsuccessful. The Duke had declared that there should be\r\nno more rural crowds, no repetition of what he called London turned\r\nloose on his own grounds. He could not forget the necessity which had\r\nbeen imposed upon him of turning Major Pountney out of his house, or\r\nthe change that had been made in his gardens, or his wife\'s attempt\r\nto conquer him at Silverbridge. "Do you mean," she said, "that we are\r\nto have nobody?" He replied that he thought it would be best to go to\r\nMatching. "And live a Darby and Joan life?" said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"I said nothing of Darby and Joan. Whatever may be my feelings I\r\nhardly think that you are fitted for that kind of thing. Matching is\r\nnot so big as Gatherum, but it is not a cottage. Of course you can\r\nask your own friends."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean by my own friends. I endeavour always to\r\nask yours."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that Major Pountney, and Captain Gunner, and Mr. Lopez\r\nwere ever among the number of my friends."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean Lady Rosina?" said the Duchess. "I shall be happy\r\nto have her at Matching if you wish it."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see Lady Rosina De Courcy at Matching very much."\r\n\r\n"And is there to be nobody else? I\'m afraid I should find it rather\r\ndull while you two were opening your hearts to each other." Here\r\nhe looked at her angrily. "Can you think of anybody besides Lady\r\nRosina?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you will wish to have Mrs. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"What an arrangement! Lady Rosina for you to flirt with, and Mrs.\r\nFinn for me to grumble to."\r\n\r\n"That is an odious word," said the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n"What;--flirting? I don\'t see anything bad about the word. The thing\r\nis dangerous. But you are quite at liberty if you don\'t go beyond\r\nLady Rosina. I should like to know whether you would wish anybody\r\nelse to come?" Of course he made no becoming answer to this question,\r\nand of course no becoming answer was expected. He knew that she was\r\ntrying to provoke him because he would not let her do this year\r\nas she had done last. The house, he had no doubt, would be full\r\nto overflowing when he got there. He could not help that. But as\r\ncompared with Gatherum Castle the house at Matching was small, and\r\nhis domestic authority sufficed at any rate for shutting up Gatherum\r\nfor the time.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether at times her sufferings were not as acute as\r\nhis own. He, at any rate, was Prime Minister, and it seemed to her\r\nthat she was to be reduced to nothing. At the beginning of it all\r\nhe had, with unwonted tenderness, asked her for her sympathy in his\r\nundertaking, and, according to her powers, she had given it to him\r\nwith her whole heart. She had thought that she had seen a way by\r\nwhich she might assist him in his great employment, and she had\r\nworked at it like a slave. Every day she told herself that she did\r\nnot, herself, love the Captain Gunners and Major Pountneys, nor the\r\nSir Orlandos, nor, indeed, the Lady Rosinas. She had not followed\r\nthe bent of her own inclination when she had descended to sheets and\r\ntowels, and busied herself to establish an archery-ground. She had\r\nnot shot an arrow during the whole season, nor had she cared who had\r\nwon and who had lost. It had not been for her own personal delight\r\nthat she had kept open house for forty persons throughout four months\r\nof the year, in doing which he had never taken an ounce of the labour\r\noff her shoulders by any single word or deed! It had all been done\r\nfor his sake,--that his reign might be long and triumphant, that the\r\nworld might say that his hospitality was noble and full, that his\r\nname might be in men\'s mouths, and that he might prosper as a British\r\nMinister. Such, at least, were the assertions which she made to\r\nherself, when she thought of her own grievances and her own troubles.\r\nAnd now she was angry with her husband. It was very well for him\r\nto ask for her sympathy, but he had none to give her in return! He\r\ncould not pity her failures,--even though he had himself caused them!\r\nIf he had a grain of intelligence about him he must, she thought,\r\nunderstand well enough how sore it must be for her to descend from\r\nher princely entertainments to solitude at Matching, and thus to own\r\nbefore all the world that she was beaten. Then when she asked him\r\nfor advice, when she was really anxious to know how far she might go\r\nin filling her house without offending him, he told her to ask Lady\r\nRosina De Courcy! If he chose to be ridiculous he might. She would\r\nask Lady Rosina De Courcy. In her active anger she did write to Lady\r\nRosina De Courcy a formal letter, in which she said that the Duke\r\nhoped to have the pleasure of her ladyship\'s company at Matching Park\r\non the 1st of August. It was an absurd letter, somewhat long, written\r\nvery much in the Duke\'s name, with overwhelming expressions of\r\naffection, instigated in the writer\'s mind partly by the fun of the\r\nsupposition that such a man as her husband should flirt with such a\r\nwoman as Lady Rosina. There was something too of anger in what she\r\nwrote, some touch of revenge. She sent off this invitation, and she\r\nsent no other. Lady Rosina took it all in good part, and replied\r\nsaying that she should have the greatest pleasure in going to\r\nMatching. She had declared to herself that she would ask none but\r\nthose he had named, and in accordance with her resolution she sent\r\nout no other written invitations.\r\n\r\nHe had also told her to ask Mrs. Finn. Now this had become almost a\r\nmatter of course. There had grown up from accidental circumstances so\r\nstrong a bond between these two women, that it was taken for granted\r\nby both their husbands that they should be nearly always within\r\nreach of one another. And the two husbands were also on kindly, if\r\nnot affectionate, terms with each other. The nature of the Duke\'s\r\ncharacter was such that, with a most loving heart, he was hardly\r\ncapable of that opening out of himself to another which is necessary\r\nfor positive friendship. There was a stiff reserve about him, of\r\nwhich he was himself only too conscious, which almost prohibited\r\nfriendship. But he liked Mr. Finn both as a man and a member of his\r\nparty, and was always satisfied to have him as a guest. The Duchess,\r\ntherefore, had taken it for granted that Mrs. Finn would come to\r\nher,--and that Mr. Finn would come also during any time that he might\r\nbe able to escape from Ireland. But, when the invitation was verbally\r\nconveyed, Mr. Finn had gone to the Admiralty, and had already made\r\nhis arrangements for going to sea, as a gallant sailor should. "We\r\nare going away in the \'Black Watch\' for a couple of months," said\r\nMrs. Finn. Now the "Black Watch" was the Admiralty yacht.\r\n\r\n"Heavens and earth!" ejaculated the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"It is always done. The First Lord would have his epaulets stripped\r\nif he didn\'t go to sea in August."\r\n\r\n"And must you go with him?"\r\n\r\n"I have promised."\r\n\r\n"I think it very unkind,--very hard upon me. Of course you knew that\r\nI should want you."\r\n\r\n"But if my husband wants me too?"\r\n\r\n"Bother your husband! I wish with all my heart I had never helped to\r\nmake up the match."\r\n\r\n"It would have been made up just the same, Lady Glen."\r\n\r\n"You know that I cannot get on without you. And he ought to know it\r\ntoo. There isn\'t another person in the world that I can really say a\r\nthing to."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you have Mrs. Grey?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s going to Persia after her husband. And then she is not wicked\r\nenough. She always lectured me, and she does it still. What do you\r\nthink is going to happen?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing terrible, I hope," said Mrs. Finn, mindful of her husband\'s\r\nnew honours at the Admiralty, and hoping that the Duke might not have\r\nrepeated his threat of resigning.\r\n\r\n"We are going to Matching."\r\n\r\n"So I supposed."\r\n\r\n"And whom do you think we are going to have?"\r\n\r\n"Not Major Pountney?"\r\n\r\n"No;--not at my asking."\r\n\r\n"Nor Mr. Lopez?"\r\n\r\n"Nor yet Mr. Lopez. Guess again."\r\n\r\n"I suppose there will be a dozen to guess."\r\n\r\n"No," shrieked the Duchess. "There will only be one. I have asked\r\none,--at his special desire,--and as you won\'t come I shall ask\r\nnobody else. When I pressed him to name a second he named you. I\'ll\r\nobey him to the letter. Now, my dear, who do you think is the chosen\r\none,--the one person who is to solace the perturbed spirit of the\r\nPrime Minister for the three months of the autumn?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Warburton, I should say."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Warburton! No doubt Mr. Warburton will come as a part of\r\nhis luggage, and possibly half-a-dozen Treasury clerks. He declares,\r\nhowever, that there is nothing to do, and therefore Mr. Warburton\'s\r\nstrength may alone suffice to help him to do it. There is to be one\r\nunnecessary guest,--unnecessary, that is, for official purpose;\r\nthough,--oh,--so much needed for his social happiness. Guess once\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n"Knowing the spirit of mischief that is in you,--perhaps it is Lady\r\nRosina."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is Lady Rosina," said the Duchess, clapping her hands\r\ntogether. "And I should like to know what you mean by a spirit of\r\nmischief! I asked him, and he himself said that he particularly\r\nwished to have Lady Rosina at Matching. Now, I\'m not a jealous\r\nwoman,--am I?"\r\n\r\n"Not of Lady Rosina."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they\'ll do any harm together, but it is particular,\r\nyou know. However, she is to come. And nobody else is to come. I did\r\ncount upon you." Then Mrs. Finn counselled her very seriously as to\r\nthe bad taste of such a joke, explaining to her that the Duke had\r\ncertainly not intended that her invitations should be confined to\r\nLady Rosina. But it was not all joke with the Duchess. She had been\r\ndriven almost to despair, and was very angry with her husband. He had\r\nbrought the thing upon himself, and must now make the best of it. She\r\nwould ask nobody else. She declared that there was nobody whom she\r\ncould ask with propriety. She was tired of asking. Let her ask whom\r\nshe would, he was dissatisfied. The only two people he cared to see\r\nwere Lady Rosina and the old Duke. She had asked Lady Rosina for his\r\nsake. Let him ask his old friend himself if he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Duchess with all the family went down together, and Mr.\r\nWarburton went with them. The Duchess had said not a word more to her\r\nhusband about his guests, nor had he alluded to the subject. But each\r\nwas labouring under a conviction that the other was misbehaving, and\r\nwith that feeling it was impossible that there should be confidence\r\nbetween them. He busied himself with books and papers,--always\r\nturning over those piles of newspapers to see what evil was said of\r\nhimself,--and speaking only now and again to his private Secretary.\r\nShe engaged herself with the children or pretended to read a novel.\r\nHer heart was sore within her. She had wished to punish him, but in\r\ntruth she was punishing herself.\r\n\r\nOn the day of their arrival, the father and mother, with Lord\r\nSilverbridge, the eldest son, who was home from Eton, and the private\r\nSecretary dined together. As the Duke sat at table, he began to think\r\nhow long it was since such a state of things had happened to him\r\nbefore, and his heart softened towards her. Instead of being made\r\nangry by the strangeness of her proceeding, he took delight in\r\nit, and in the course of the evening spoke a word to signify his\r\nsatisfaction. "I\'m afraid it won\'t last long," she said, "for Lady\r\nRosina comes to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed."\r\n\r\n"You bid me ask her yourself."\r\n\r\nThen he perceived it all;--how she had taken advantage of his former\r\nanswer to her and had acted upon it in a spirit of contradictory\r\npetulance. But he resolved that he would forgive it and endeavour\r\nto bring her back to him. "I thought we were both joking," he said\r\ngood-humouredly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! I never suspected you of a joke. At any rate she is coming."\r\n\r\n"She will do neither of us any harm. And Mrs. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"You have sent her to sea."\r\n\r\n"She may be at sea,--and he too; but it is without my sending. The\r\nFirst Lord, I believe, usually does go a cruise. Is there nobody\r\nelse?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody else,--unless you have asked any one."\r\n\r\n"Not a creature. Well;--so much the better. I dare say Lady Rosina\r\nwill get on very well."\r\n\r\n"You will have to talk to her," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"I will do my best," said the Duke.\r\n\r\nLady Rosina came and no doubt did think it odd. But she did not say\r\nso, and it really did seem to the Duchess as though all her vengeance\r\nhad been blown away by the winds. And she too laughed at the\r\nmatter--to herself, and began to feel less cross and less perverse.\r\nThe world did not come to an end because she and her husband with\r\nLady Rosina and her boy and the private Secretary sat down to dinner\r\nevery day together. The parish clergyman with the neighbouring squire\r\nand his wife and daughter did come one day,--to the relief of M.\r\nMillepois, who had begun to feel that the world had collapsed. And\r\nevery day at a certain hour the Duke and Lady Rosina walked together\r\nfor an hour and a half in the park. The Duchess would have enjoyed\r\nit, instead of suffering, could she only have had her friend, Mrs.\r\nFinn, to hear her jokes. "Now, Plantagenet," she said, "do tell me\r\none thing. What does she talk about?"\r\n\r\n"The troubles of her family generally, I think."\r\n\r\n"That can\'t last for ever."\r\n\r\n"She wears cork soles to her boots and she thinks a good deal about\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"And you listen to her?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? I can talk about cork soles as well as anything else.\r\nAnything that may do material good to the world at large, or even to\r\nyourself privately, is a fit subject for conversation to rational\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I never was one of them."\r\n\r\n"But I can talk upon anything," continued the Duke, "as long as the\r\ntalker talks in good faith and does not say things that should not be\r\nsaid, or deal with matters that are offensive. I could talk for an\r\nhour about bankers\' accounts, but I should not expect a stranger to\r\nask me the state of my own. She has almost persuaded me to send to\r\nMr. Sprout of Silverbridge and get some cork soles myself."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do anything of the kind," said the Duchess with animation;--as\r\nthough she had secret knowledge that cork soles were specially fatal\r\nto the family of the Pallisers.\r\n\r\n"Why not, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"He was the man who especially, above all others, threw me over at\r\nSilverbridge." Then again there came upon his brow that angry frown\r\nwhich during the last few days had been dissipated by the innocence\r\nof Lady Rosina\'s conversation. "Of course I don\'t mean to ask you\r\nto take any interest in the borough again. You have said that you\r\nwouldn\'t, and you are always as good as your word."\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"But I certainly would not employ a tradesman just at your elbow who\r\nhas directly opposed what was generally understood in the town to be\r\nyour interests."\r\n\r\n"What did Mr. Sprout do? This is the first I have heard of it."\r\n\r\n"He got Mr. Du Boung to stand against Mr. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad for the sake of the borough that Mr. Lopez did not\r\nget in."\r\n\r\n"So am I. But that is nothing to do with it. Mr. Sprout knew at any\r\nrate what my wishes were, and went directly against them."\r\n\r\n"You were not entitled to have wishes in the matter, Glencora."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well;--but I had, and he knew it. As for the future,\r\nof course, the thing is over. But you have done everything for the\r\nborough."\r\n\r\n"You mean that the borough has done much for me."\r\n\r\n"I know what I mean very well;--and I shall take it very ill if a\r\nshilling out of the Castle ever goes into Mr. Sprout\'s pocket again."\r\n\r\nIt is needless to trouble the reader at length with the sermon which\r\nhe preached her on the occasion,--showing the utter corruption which\r\nmust come from the mixing up of politics with trade, or with the\r\nscorn which she threw into the few words with which she interrupted\r\nhim from time to time. "Whether a man makes good shoes, and at a\r\nreasonable price, and charges for them honestly,--that is what you\r\nhave to consider," said the Duke impressively.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather pay double for bad shoes to a man who did not thwart me."\r\n\r\n"You should not condescend to be thwarted in such a matter. You lower\r\nyourself by admitting such a feeling." And yet he writhed himself\r\nunder the lashes of Mr. Slide!\r\n\r\n"I know an enemy when I see him," said the Duchess, "and as long as I\r\nlive I\'ll treat an enemy as an enemy."\r\n\r\nThere was ever so much of it, in the course of which the Duke\r\ndeclared his purpose of sending at once to Mr. Sprout for ever so\r\nmany cork soles, and the Duchess,--most imprudently,--declared her\r\npurpose of ruining Mr. Sprout. There was something in this threat\r\nwhich grated terribly against the Duke\'s sense of honour;--that his\r\nwife should threaten to ruin a poor tradesman, that she should do so\r\nin reference to the political affairs of the borough which he all\r\nbut owned,--that she should do so in declared opposition to him! Of\r\ncourse he ought to have known that her sin consisted simply in her\r\ndetermination to vex him at the moment. A more good-natured woman did\r\nnot live;--or one less prone to ruin any one. But any reference to\r\nthe Silverbridge election brought back upon him the remembrance of\r\nthe cruel attacks which had been made upon him, and rendered him\r\nfor the time moody, morose, and wretched. So they again parted ill\r\nfriends, and hardly spoke when they met at dinner.\r\n\r\nThe next morning there reached Matching a letter which greatly added\r\nto his bitterness of spirit against the world in general and against\r\nher in particular. The letter, though marked "private," had been\r\nopened, as were all his letters, by Mr. Warburton, but the private\r\nSecretary thought it necessary to show the letter to the Prime\r\nMinister. He, when he had read it, told Warburton that it did not\r\nsignify, and maintained for half-an-hour an attitude of quiescence.\r\nThen he walked forth, having the letter hidden in his hand, and\r\nfinding his wife alone, gave it her to read. "See what you have\r\nbrought upon me," he said, "by your interference and disobedience."\r\nThe letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Manchester Square, August 3, 187--.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD DUKE,\r\n\r\n   I consider myself entitled to complain to your Grace of\r\n   the conduct with which I was treated at the last election\r\n   at Silverbridge, whereby I was led into very heavy\r\n   expenditure without the least chance of being returned for\r\n   the borough. I am aware that I had no direct conversation\r\n   with your Grace on the subject, and that your Grace can\r\n   plead that, as between man and man, I had no authority\r\n   from yourself for supposing that I should receive your\r\n   Grace\'s support. But I was distinctly asked by the Duchess\r\n   to stand, and was assured by her that if I did so I should\r\n   have all the assistance that your Grace\'s influence could\r\n   procure for me;--and it was also explained to me that\r\n   your Grace\'s official position made it inexpedient that\r\n   your Grace on this special occasion should have any\r\n   personal conference with your own candidate. Under these\r\n   circumstances I submit to your Grace that I am entitled to\r\n   complain of the hardship I have suffered.\r\n\r\n   I had not been long in the borough before I found that my\r\n   position was hopeless. Influential men in the town who had\r\n   been represented to me as being altogether devoted to your\r\n   Grace\'s interests started a third candidate,--a Liberal as\r\n   myself,--and the natural consequence was that neither of\r\n   us succeeded, though my return as your Grace\'s candidate\r\n   would have been certain had not this been done. That all\r\n   this was preconcerted there can be no doubt, but, before\r\n   the mine was sprung on me,--immediately, indeed, on my\r\n   arrival, if I remember rightly,--an application was made\r\n   to me for L500, so that the money might be exacted before\r\n   the truth was known to me. Of course I should not have\r\n   paid the L500 had I known that your Grace\'s usual agents\r\n   in the town,--I may name Mr. Sprout especially,--were\r\n   prepared to act against me. But I did pay the money,\r\n   and I think your Grace will agree with me that a very\r\n   opprobrious term might be applied without injustice to the\r\n   transaction.\r\n\r\n   My Lord Duke, I am a poor man;--ambitious I will own,\r\n   whether that be a sin or a virtue,--and willing, perhaps,\r\n   to incur expenditure which can hardly be justified in\r\n   pursuit of certain public objects. But I must say, with\r\n   the most lively respect for your Grace personally, that I\r\n   do not feel inclined to sit down tamely under such a loss\r\n   as this. I should not have dreamed of interfering in the\r\n   election at Silverbridge had not the Duchess exhorted me\r\n   to do so. I would not even have run the risk of a doubtful\r\n   contest. But I came forward at the suggestion of the\r\n   Duchess, backed by her personal assurance that the seat\r\n   was certain as being in your Grace\'s hands. It was no\r\n   doubt understood that your Grace would not yourself\r\n   interfere, but it was equally well understood that your\r\n   Grace\'s influence was for the time deputed to the Duchess.\r\n   The Duchess herself will, I am sure, confirm my statement\r\n   that I had her direct authority for regarding myself as\r\n   your Grace\'s candidate.\r\n\r\n   I can of course bring an action against Mr. Wise, the\r\n   gentleman to whom I paid the money, but I feel that as a\r\n   gentleman I should not do so without reference to your\r\n   Grace, as circumstances might possibly be brought out in\r\n   evidence,--I will not say prejudicial to your Grace,--but\r\n   which would be unbecoming. I cannot, however, think that\r\n   your Grace will be willing that a poor man like myself,\r\n   in his search for an entrance into public life, should be\r\n   mulcted to so heavy an extent in consequence of an error\r\n   on the part of the Duchess. Should your Grace be able\r\n   to assist me in my view of getting into Parliament for\r\n   any other seat I shall be willing to abide the loss I\r\n   have incurred. I hardly, however, dare to hope for such\r\n   assistance. In this case I think your Grace ought to see\r\n   that I am reimbursed.\r\n\r\n   I have the honour to be,\r\n   My Lord Duke,\r\n   Your Grace\'s very faithful Servant,\r\n\r\n   FERDINAND LOPEZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke stood over her in her own room upstairs, with his back to\r\nthe fireplace and his eyes fixed upon her while she was reading this\r\nletter. He gave her ample time, and she did not read it very quickly.\r\nMuch of it indeed she perused twice, turning very red in the face as\r\nshe did so. She was thus studious partly because the letter astounded\r\neven her, and partly because she wanted time to consider how she\r\nwould meet his wrath. "Well," said he, "what do you say to that?"\r\n\r\n"The man is a blackguard,--of course."\r\n\r\n"He is so;--though I do not know that I wish to hear him called such\r\na name by your lips. Let him be what he may he was your friend."\r\n\r\n"He was my acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"He was the man whom you selected to be your candidate for the\r\nborough in opposition to my wishes, and whom you continued to support\r\nin direct disobedience to my orders."\r\n\r\n"Surely, Plantagenet, we have had all that about disobedience out\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"You cannot have such things \'out,\'--as you call it. Evil-doing will\r\nnot bury itself out of the way and be done with. Do you feel no shame\r\nat having your name mentioned a score of times with reprobation as\r\nthat man mentions it;--at being written about by such a man as that?"\r\n\r\n"Do you want to make me roll in the gutter because I mistook him for\r\na gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"That was not all,--nor half. In your eagerness to serve such a\r\nmiserable creature as this you forgot my entreaties, my commands,\r\nmy position! I explained to you why I, of all men, and you, of all\r\nwomen, as a part of me, should not do this thing; and yet you did it,\r\nmistaking such a cur as that for a man! What am I to do? How am I to\r\nfree myself from the impediments which you make for me? My enemies I\r\ncan overcome,--but I cannot escape the pitfalls which are made for\r\nme by my own wife. I can only retire into private life and hope to\r\nconsole myself with my children and my books."\r\n\r\nThere was a reality of tragedy about him which for the moment\r\novercame her. She had no joke ready, no sarcasm, no feminine\r\ncounter-grumble. Little as she agreed with him when he spoke of the\r\nnecessity of retiring into private life because a man had written\r\nto him such a letter as this, incapable as she was of understanding\r\nfully the nature of the irritation which tormented him, still she\r\nknew that he was suffering, and acknowledged to herself that she had\r\nbeen the cause of the agony. "I am sorry," she ejaculated at last.\r\n"What more can I say?"\r\n\r\n"What am I to do? What can be said to the man? Warburton read the\r\nletter, and gave it me in silence. He could see the terrible\r\ndifficulty."\r\n\r\n"Tear it in pieces, and then let there be an end of it."\r\n\r\n"I do not feel sure but that he has right on his side. He is, as you\r\nsay, certainly a blackguard, or he would not make such a claim. He is\r\ntaking advantage of the mistake made by a good-natured woman through\r\nher folly and her vanity;"--as he said this the Duchess gave an\r\nabsurd little pout, but luckily he did not see it,--"and he knows\r\nvery well that he is doing so. But still he has a show of justice on\r\nhis side. There was, I suppose, no chance for him at Silverbridge\r\nafter I had made myself fully understood. The money was absolutely\r\nwasted. It was your persuasion and then your continued encouragement\r\nthat led him on to spend the money."\r\n\r\n"Pay it then. The loss will not hurt you."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--if we could but get out of our difficulties by paying! Suppose\r\nthat I do pay it. I begin to think that I must pay it;--that after\r\nall I cannot allow such a plea to remain unanswered. But when it is\r\npaid;--what then? Do you think such a payment made by the Queen\'s\r\nMinister will not be known to all the newspapers, and that I shall\r\nescape the charge of having bribed the man to hold his tongue?"\r\n\r\n"It will be no bribe if you pay him because you think you ought."\r\n\r\n"But how shall I excuse it? There are things done which are holy as\r\nthe heavens,--which are clear before God as the light of the sun,\r\nwhich leave no stain on the conscience, and which yet the malignity\r\nof man can invest with the very blackness of hell! I shall know why\r\nI pay this L500. Because she who of all the world is the nearest and\r\nthe dearest to me,"--she looked up into his face with amazement, as\r\nhe stood stretching out both his arms in his energy,--"has in her\r\nimpetuous folly committed a grievous blunder, from which she would\r\nnot allow her husband to save her, this sum must be paid to the\r\nwretched craven. But I cannot tell the world that. I cannot say\r\nabroad that this small sacrifice of money was the justest means of\r\nretrieving the injury which you had done."\r\n\r\n"Say it abroad. Say it everywhere."\r\n\r\n"No, Glencora."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that I would have you spare me if it was my fault? And\r\nhow would it hurt me? Will it be new to any one that I have done a\r\nfoolish thing? Will the newspapers disturb my peace? I sometimes\r\nthink, Plantagenet, that I should have been the man, my skin is so\r\nthick; and that you should have been the woman, yours is so tender."\r\n\r\n"But it is not so."\r\n\r\n"Take the advantage, nevertheless, of my toughness. Send him the L500\r\nwithout a word,--or make Warburton do so, or Mr. Moreton. Make no\r\nsecret of it. Then if the papers talk about it--"\r\n\r\n"A question might be asked about it in the House."\r\n\r\n"Or if questioned in any way,--say that I did it. Tell the exact\r\ntruth. You are always saying that nothing but truth ever serves. Let\r\nthe truth serve now. I shall not blench. Your saying it all in the\r\nHouse of Lords won\'t wound me half so much as your looking at me as\r\nyou did just now."\r\n\r\n"Did I wound you? God knows I would not hurt you willingly."\r\n\r\n"Never mind. Go on. I know you think that I have brought it all on\r\nmyself by my own wickedness. Pay this man the money, and then if\r\nanything be said about it, explain that it was my fault, and say that\r\nyou paid the money because I had done wrong."\r\n\r\nWhen he came in she had been seated on a sofa, which she constantly\r\nused herself, and he had stood over her, masterful, imperious, and\r\nalmost tyrannical. She had felt his tyranny, but had resented it\r\nless than usual,--or rather had been less determined in holding her\r\nown against him and asserting herself as his equal,--because she\r\nconfessed to herself that she had injured him. She had, she thought,\r\ndone but little, but that which she had done had produced this\r\ninjury. So she had sat and endured the oppression of his standing\r\nposture. But now he sat down by her, very close to her, and put his\r\nhand upon her shoulder,--almost round her waist.\r\n\r\n"Cora," he said, "you do not quite understand it."\r\n\r\n"I never understand anything, I think," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Not in this case,--perhaps never,--what it is that a husband feels\r\nabout his wife. Do you think that I could say a word against you,\r\neven to a friend?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I never did. I never could. If my anger were at the hottest I would\r\nnot confess to a human being that you were not perfect,--except to\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you! If you were to scold me vicariously I should feel it\r\nless."\r\n\r\n"Do not joke with me now, for I am so much in earnest! And if I could\r\nnot consent that your conduct should be called in question even by a\r\nfriend, do you suppose it possible that I could contrive an escape\r\nfrom public censure by laying the blame publicly on you?"\r\n\r\n"Stick to the truth;--that\'s what you always say."\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall stick to the truth. A man and his wife are one.\r\nFor what she does he is responsible."\r\n\r\n"They couldn\'t hang you, you know, because I committed a murder."\r\n\r\n"I should be willing that they should do so. No;--if I pay this money\r\nI shall take the consequences. I shall not do it in any way under the\r\nrose. But I wish you would remember--"\r\n\r\n"Remember what? I know I shall never forget all this trouble about\r\nthat dirty little town, which I never will enter again as long as I\r\nlive."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would think that in all that you do you are dealing with\r\nmy feelings, with my heartstrings, with my reputation. You cannot\r\ndivide yourself from me; nor, for the value of it all, would I wish\r\nthat such division were possible. You say that I am thin-skinned."\r\n\r\n"Certainly you are. What people call a delicate\r\norganisation,--whereas I am rough and thick and monstrously\r\ncommonplace."\r\n\r\n"Then should you too be thin-skinned for my sake."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could make you thick-skinned for your own. It\'s the only\r\nway to be decently comfortable in such a coarse, rough-and-tumble\r\nworld as this is."\r\n\r\n"Let us both do our best," he said, now putting his arm round her and\r\nkissing her. "I think I shall send the man his money at once. It is\r\nthe least of two evils. And now let there never be a word more about\r\nit between us."\r\n\r\nThen he left her and went back,--not to the study in which he was\r\nwont, when at Matching, to work with his private Secretary,--but\r\nto a small inner closet of his own, in which many a bitter moment\r\nwas spent while he thought over that abortive system of decimal\r\ncoinage by which he had once hoped to make himself one of the great\r\nbenefactors of his nation, revolving in his mind the troubles which\r\nhis wife brought upon him, and regretting the golden inanity of the\r\ncoronet which in the very prime of life had expelled him from the\r\nHouse of Commons. Here he seated himself, and for an hour neither\r\nstirred from his seat, nor touched a pen, nor opened a book. He was\r\ntrying to calculate in his mind what might be the consequences of\r\npaying the money to Mr. Lopez. But when the calculation slipped\r\nfrom him,--as it did,--then he demanded of himself whether strict\r\nhigh-minded justice did not call upon him to pay the money let the\r\nconsequences be what they might. And here his mind was truer to him,\r\nand he was able to fix himself to a purpose,--though the resolution\r\nto which he came was not, perhaps, wise.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour was over he went to his desk, drew a cheque for L500 in\r\nfavour of Ferdinand Lopez, and then caused his Secretary to send it\r\nin the following note:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Matching, August 4, 187--.\r\n\r\n   SIR,--\r\n\r\n   The Duke of Omnium has read the letter you have addressed to him,\r\n   dated the 3rd instant. The Duke of Omnium, feeling that you may\r\n   have been induced to undertake the late contest at Silverbridge by\r\n   misrepresentations made to you at Gatherum Castle, directs me to\r\n   enclose a cheque for L500, that being the sum stated by you to have\r\n   been expended in carrying on the contest at Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n   I am, sir,\r\n   Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n   ARTHUR WARBURTON.\r\n\r\n   Ferdinand Lopez, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nKauri Gum\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will no doubt think that Ferdinand Lopez must have been\r\nvery hardly driven indeed by circumstances before he would have made\r\nsuch an appeal to the Duke as that given in the last chapter. But\r\nit was not want of money only that had brought it about. It may\r\nbe remembered that the L500 had already been once repaid him by\r\nhis father-in-law,--that special sum having been given to him for\r\nthat special purpose. And Lopez, when he wrote to the Duke, assured\r\nhimself that if, by any miracle, his letter should produce pecuniary\r\nresults in the shape of a payment from the Duke, he would refund the\r\nmoney so obtained to Mr. Wharton. But when he wrote the letter he did\r\nnot expect to get money,--nor, indeed, did he expect that aid towards\r\nanother seat, to which he alluded at the close of his letter. He\r\nexpected probably nothing but to vex the Duke, and to drive the Duke\r\ninto a correspondence with him.\r\n\r\nThough this man had lived nearly all his life in England, he had not\r\nquite acquired that knowledge of the way in which things are done\r\nwhich is so general among men of a certain class, and so rare among\r\nthose beneath them. He had not understood that the Duchess\'s promise\r\nof her assistance at Silverbridge might be taken by him for what it\r\nwas worth, and that her aid might be used as far as it went,--but,\r\nthat in the event of its failing him, he was bound in honour to take\r\nthe result without complaining, whatever that result might be. He\r\nfelt that a grievous injury had been done him, and that it behoved\r\nhim to resent that injury,--even though it were against a woman.\r\nHe just knew that he could not very well write to the Duchess\r\nherself,--though there was sometimes present to his mind a plan for\r\nattacking her in public, and telling her what evil she had done him.\r\nHe had half resolved that he would do so in her own garden at the\r\nHorns;--but on that occasion the apparition of Arthur Fletcher had\r\ndisturbed him, and he had vented his anger in another direction. But\r\nstill his wrath against the Duke and Duchess remained, and he was\r\nwont to indulge it with very violent language as he sat upon one of\r\nthe chairs in Sexty Parker\'s office, talking somewhat loudly of his\r\nown position, of the things that he would do, and of the injury done\r\nhim. Sexty Parker sympathised with him to the full,--especially as\r\nthat first L500, which he had received from Mr. Wharton, had gone\r\ninto Sexty\'s coffers. At that time Lopez and Sexty were together\r\ncommitted to large speculations in the guano trade, and Sexty\'s mind\r\nwas by no means easy in the early periods of the day. As he went\r\ninto town by his train, he would think of his wife and family and of\r\nthe terrible things that might happen to them. But yet, up to this\r\nperiod, money had always been forthcoming from Lopez when absolutely\r\nwanted, and Sexty was quite alive to the fact that he was living\r\nwith a freedom of expenditure in his own household that he had never\r\nknown before, and that without apparent damage. Whenever, therefore,\r\nat some critical moment, a much-needed sum of money was produced,\r\nSexty would become light-hearted, triumphant, and very sympathetic.\r\n"Well;--I never heard such a story," he had said when Lopez was\r\ninsisting on his wrongs. "That\'s what the Dukes and Duchesses call\r\nhonour among thieves! Well, Ferdy, my boy, if you stand that you\'ll\r\nstand anything." In these latter days Sexty had become very intimate\r\nindeed with his partner.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to stand it," Lopez had replied, and then on the spot\r\nhad written the letter which he had dated from Manchester Square.\r\nHe had certainly contrived to make that letter as oppressive as\r\npossible. He had been clever enough to put into it words which were\r\nsure to wound the poor Duke and to confound the Duchess. And having\r\nwritten it he was very careful to keep the first draft, so that if\r\noccasion came he might use it again and push his vengeance farther.\r\nBut he certainly had not expected such a result as it produced.\r\n\r\nWhen he received the private Secretary\'s letter with the money he\r\nwas sitting opposite to his father-in-law at breakfast, while his\r\nwife was making the tea. Not many of his letters came to Manchester\r\nSquare. Sexty Parker\'s office or his club were more convenient\r\naddresses; but in this case he had thought that Manchester Square\r\nwould have a better sound and appearance. When he opened the letter\r\nthe cheque of course appeared bearing the Duke\'s own signature. He\r\nhad seen that and the amount before he had read the letter, and\r\nas he saw it his eye travelled quickly across the table to his\r\nfather-in-law\'s face. Mr. Wharton might certainly have seen the\r\ncheque and even the amount, probably also the signature, without the\r\nslightest suspicion as to the nature of the payment made. As it was,\r\nhe was eating his toast, and had thought nothing about the letter.\r\nLopez, having concealed the cheque, read the few words which the\r\nprivate Secretary had written, and then put the document with its\r\ncontents into his pocket. "So you think, sir, of going down to\r\nHerefordshire on the 15th," he said in a very cheery voice. The\r\ncheery voice was still pleasant to the old man, but the young wife\r\nhad already come to distrust it. She had learned, though she was\r\nhardly conscious how the lesson had come to her, that a certain tone\r\nof cheeriness indicated, if not deceit, at any rate the concealment\r\nof something. It grated against her spirit; and when this tone\r\nreached her ears a frown or look of sorrow would cross her brow. And\r\nher husband also had perceived that it was so, and knew at such times\r\nthat he was rebuked. He was hardly aware what doings, and especially\r\nwhat feelings, were imputed to him as faults,--not understanding the\r\nlines which separated right from wrong; but he knew that he was often\r\ncondemned by his wife, and he lived in fear that he should also be\r\ncondemned by his wife\'s father. Had it been his wife only, he thought\r\nthat he could soon have quenched her condemnation. He would soon have\r\nmade her tired of showing her disapproval. But he had put himself\r\ninto the old man\'s house, where the old man could see not only him\r\nbut his treatment of his wife, and the old man\'s good-will and good\r\nopinion were essential to him. Yet he could not restrain one glance\r\nof anger at her when he saw that look upon her face.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I shall," said the barrister. "I must go somewhere. My\r\ngoing need not disturb you."\r\n\r\n"I think we have made up our mind," said Lopez, "to take a cottage at\r\nDovercourt. It is not a very lively place, nor yet fashionable. But\r\nit is very healthy, and I can run up to town easily. Unfortunately my\r\nbusiness won\'t let me be altogether away this autumn."\r\n\r\n"I wish my business would keep me," said the barrister.\r\n\r\n"I did not understand that you had made up your mind to go to\r\nDovercourt," said Emily. He had spoken to Mr. Wharton of their joint\r\naction in the matter, and as the place had only once been named by\r\nhim to her, she resented what seemed to be a falsehood. She knew\r\nthat she was to be taken or left as it suited him. If he had said\r\nboldly,--"We\'ll go to Dovercourt. That\'s what I\'ve settled on.\r\nThat\'s what will suit me," she would have been contented. She quite\r\nunderstood that he meant to have his own way in such things. But\r\nit seemed to her that he wanted to be a tyrant without having the\r\ncourage necessary for tyranny.\r\n\r\n"I thought you seemed to like it," he said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t dislike it at all."\r\n\r\n"Then, as it suits my business, we might as well consider it\r\nsettled." So saying, he left the room and went off to the city. The\r\nold man was still sipping his tea and lingering over his breakfast in\r\na way that was not usual with him. He was generally anxious to get\r\naway to Lincoln\'s Inn, and on most mornings had left the house before\r\nhis son-in-law. Emily of course remained with him, sitting silent in\r\nher place opposite to the teapot, meditating perhaps on her prospects\r\nof happiness at Dovercourt,--a place of which she had never heard\r\neven the name two days ago, and in which it was hardly possible that\r\nshe should find even an acquaintance. In former years these autumn\r\nmonths, passed in Herefordshire, had been the delight of her life.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton also had seen the cloud on his daughter\'s face, and had\r\nunderstood the nature of the little dialogue about Dovercourt. And\r\nhe was aware,--had been aware since they had both come into his\r\nhouse,--that the young wife\'s manner and tone to her husband was not\r\nthat of perfect conjugal sympathy. He had already said to himself\r\nmore than once that she had made her bed for herself, and must lie\r\nupon it. She was the man\'s wife, and must take her husband as he was.\r\nIf she suffered under this man\'s mode and manner of life, he, as her\r\nfather, could not assist her,--could do nothing for her, unless the\r\nman should become absolutely cruel. He had settled that within his\r\nown mind already; but yet his heart yearned towards her, and when\r\nhe thought that she was unhappy he longed to comfort her and tell\r\nher that she still had a father. But the time had not come as yet\r\nin which he could comfort her by sympathising with her against\r\nher husband. There had never fallen from her lips a syllable of\r\ncomplaint. When she had spoken to him a chance word respecting her\r\nhusband, it had always carried with it some tone of affection. But\r\nstill he longed to say to her something which might tell her that his\r\nheart was soft towards her. "Do you like the idea of going to this\r\nplace?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t at all know what it will be like. Ferdinand says it will be\r\ncheap."\r\n\r\n"Is that of such vital consequence?"\r\n\r\n"Ah;--yes; I fear it is."\r\n\r\nThis was very sad to him. Lopez had already had from him a\r\nconsiderable sum of money, having not yet been married twelve months,\r\nand was now living in London almost free of expense. Before his\r\nmarriage he had always spoken of himself, and had contrived to be\r\nspoken of, as a wealthy man, and now he was obliged to choose some\r\nsmall English seaside place to which to retreat, because thus he\r\nmight live at a low rate! Had they married as poor people there would\r\nhave been nothing to regret in this;--there would be nothing that\r\nmight not be done with entire satisfaction. But, as it was, it told a\r\nbad tale for the future! "Do you understand his money matters,\r\nEmily?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, papa."\r\n\r\n"I do not in the least mean to make inquiry. Perhaps I should have\r\nasked before;--but if I did make inquiry now it would be of him. But\r\nI think a wife should know."\r\n\r\n"I know nothing."\r\n\r\n"What is his business?"\r\n\r\n"I have no idea. I used to think he was connected with Mr. Mills\r\nHapperton and with Messrs. Hunky and Sons."\r\n\r\n"Is he not connected with Hunky\'s house?"\r\n\r\n"I think not. He has a partner of the name of Parker, who is,--who is\r\nnot, I think, quite--quite a gentleman. I never saw him."\r\n\r\n"What does he do with Mr. Parker?"\r\n\r\n"I believe they buy guano."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--that, I fancy, was only one affair."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he lost money, papa, by that election at Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"I paid that," said Mr. Wharton sternly. Surely he should have told\r\nhis wife that he had received that money from her family!\r\n\r\n"Did you? That was very kind. I am afraid, papa, we are a great\r\nburden on you."\r\n\r\n"I should not mind it, my dear, if there were confidence and\r\nhappiness. What matter would it be to me whether you had your money\r\nnow or hereafter, so that you might have it in the manner that would\r\nbe most beneficial to you? I wish he would be open with me, and tell\r\nme everything."\r\n\r\n"Shall I let him know that you say so?"\r\n\r\nHe thought for a minute or two before he answered her. Perhaps the\r\nman would be more impressed if the message came to him through his\r\nwife. "If you think that he will not be annoyed with you, you may do\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why he should,--but if it be right, that must be borne.\r\nI am not afraid to say anything to him."\r\n\r\n"Then tell him so. Tell him that it will be better that he should\r\nlet me know the whole condition of his affairs. God bless you, dear."\r\nThen he stooped over her, and kissed her, and went his way to Stone\r\nBuildings.\r\n\r\nIt was not as he sat at the breakfast table that Ferdinand Lopez made\r\nup his mind to pocket the Duke\'s money and to say nothing about it to\r\nMr. Wharton. He had been careful to conceal the cheque, but he had\r\ndone so with the feeling that the matter was one to be considered in\r\nhis own mind before he took any step. As he left the house, already\r\nconsidering it, he was inclined to think that the money must be\r\nsurrendered. Mr. Wharton had very generously paid his electioneering\r\nexpenses, but had not done so simply with the view of making him a\r\npresent of money. He wished the Duke had not taken him at his word.\r\nIn handing this cheque over to Mr. Wharton he would be forced to tell\r\nthe story of his letter to the Duke, and he was sure that Mr. Wharton\r\nwould not approve of his having written such a letter. How could\r\nany one approve of his having applied for a sum of money which had\r\nalready been paid to him? How could such a one as Mr. Wharton,--an\r\nold-fashioned English gentleman,--approve of such an application\r\nbeing made under any circumstances? Mr. Wharton would very probably\r\ninsist on having the cheque sent back to the Duke,--which would be\r\na sorry end to the triumph as at present achieved. And the more he\r\nthought of it the more sure he was that it would be imprudent to\r\nmention to Mr. Wharton his application to the Duke. The old men\r\nof the present day were, he said to himself, such fools that they\r\nunderstood nothing. And then the money was very convenient to\r\nhim. He was intent on obtaining Sexty Parker\'s consent to a large\r\nspeculation, and knew that he could not do so without a show of\r\nfunds. By the time, therefore, that he had reached the city he had\r\nresolved that at any rate for the present he would use the money and\r\nsay nothing about it to Mr. Wharton. Was it not spoil got from the\r\nenemy by his own courage and cleverness? When he was writing his\r\nacknowledgement for the money to Warburton he had taught himself to\r\nlook upon the sum extracted from the Duke as a matter quite distinct\r\nfrom the payment made to him by his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nIt was evident on that day to Sexty Parker that his partner was a\r\nman of great resources. Though things sometimes looked very bad, yet\r\nmoney always "turned up." Some of their buyings and sellings had\r\nanswered pretty well. Some had been great failures. No great stroke\r\nhad been made as yet, but then the great stroke was always being\r\nexpected. Sexty\'s fears were greatly exaggerated by the feeling that\r\nthe coffee and guano were not always real coffee and guano. His\r\npartner, indeed, was of opinion that in such a trade as this they\r\nwere following there was no need at all of real coffee and real\r\nguano, and explained his theory with considerable eloquence. "If I\r\nbuy a ton of coffee and keep it six weeks, why do I buy it and keep\r\nit, and why does the seller sell it instead of keeping it? The seller\r\nsells it because he thinks he can do best by parting with it now at a\r\ncertain price. I buy it because I think I can make money by keeping\r\nit. It is just the same as though we were to back our opinions. He\r\nbacks the fall. I back the rise. You needn\'t have coffee and you\r\nneedn\'t have guano to do this. Indeed the possession of the coffee\r\nor the guano is only a very clumsy addition to the trouble of your\r\nprofession. I make it my study to watch the markets;--but I needn\'t\r\nbuy everything I see in order to make money by my labour and\r\nintelligence." Sexty Parker before his lunch always thought that his\r\npartner was wrong, but after that ceremony he almost daily became\r\na convert to the great doctrine. Coffee and guano still had to be\r\nbought because the world was dull and would not learn the tricks of\r\ntrade as taught by Ferdinand Lopez,--also possibly because somebody\r\nmight want such articles,--but our enterprising hero looked for a\r\ntime in which no such dull burden should be imposed on him.\r\n\r\nOn this day, when the Duke\'s L500 was turned into the business, Sexty\r\nyielded in a large matter which his partner had been pressing upon\r\nhim for the last week. They bought a cargo of Kauri gum, coming from\r\nNew Zealand. Lopez had reasons for thinking that Kauri gum must have\r\na great rise. There was an immense demand for amber, and Kauri gum\r\nmight be used as a substitute, and in six months\' time would be\r\ndouble its present value. This unfortunately was a real cargo. He\r\ncould not find an individual so enterprising as to venture to deal in\r\na cargo of Kauri gum after his fashion. But the next best thing was\r\ndone. The real cargo was bought, and his name and Sexty\'s name were\r\non the bills given for the goods. On that day he returned home in\r\nhigh spirits, for he did believe in his own intelligence and good\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton Intends to Make a New Will\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that afternoon, immediately on the husband\'s return to the house,\r\nhis wife spoke to him as her father had desired. On that evening Mr.\r\nWharton was dining at his club, and therefore there was the whole\r\nevening before them; but the thing to be done was disagreeable, and\r\ntherefore she did it at once,--rushing into the matter almost before\r\nhe had seated himself in the arm-chair which he had appropriated to\r\nhis use in the drawing-room. "Papa was talking about our affairs\r\nafter you left this morning, and he thinks that it would be so much\r\nbetter if you would tell him all about them."\r\n\r\n"What made him talk of that to-day?" he said, turning at her almost\r\nangrily and thinking at once of the Duke\'s cheque.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is natural that he should be anxious about us,\r\nFerdinand;--and the more natural as he has money to give if he\r\nchooses to give it."\r\n\r\n"I have asked him for nothing lately;--though, by George, I intend to\r\nask him and that very roundly. Three thousand pounds isn\'t much of a\r\nsum of money for your father to have given you."\r\n\r\n"And he paid the election bill;--didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"He has been complaining of that behind my back,--has he? I didn\'t\r\nask him for it. He offered it. I wasn\'t such a fool as to refuse, but\r\nhe needn\'t bring that up as a grievance to you."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t brought up as a grievance. I was saying that your standing\r\nhad been a heavy expenditure--"\r\n\r\n"Why did you say so? What made you talk about it at all? Why should\r\nyou be discussing my affairs behind my back?"\r\n\r\n"To my own father! And that too when you are telling me every day\r\nthat I am to induce him to help you!"\r\n\r\n"Not by complaining that I am poor. But how did it all begin?" She\r\nhad to think for a moment before she could recollect how it did\r\nbegin. "There has been something," he said, "which you are ashamed to\r\ntell me."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing that I am ashamed to tell you. There never has been\r\nand never will be anything." And she stood up as she spoke, with open\r\neyes and extended nostrils. "Whatever may come, however wretched it\r\nmay be, I shall not be ashamed of myself."\r\n\r\n"But of me!"\r\n\r\n"Why do you say so? Why do you try to make unhappiness between us?"\r\n\r\n"You have been talking of--my poverty."\r\n\r\n"My father asked why you should go to Dovercourt,--and whether it was\r\nbecause it would save expense."\r\n\r\n"You want to go somewhere?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I am contented to stay in London. But I said that I\r\nthought the expense had a good deal to do with it. Of course it has."\r\n\r\n"Where do you want to be taken? I suppose Dovercourt is not\r\nfashionable."\r\n\r\n"I want nothing."\r\n\r\n"If you are thinking of travelling abroad, I can\'t spare the time.\r\nIt isn\'t an affair of money, and you had no business to say so. I\r\nthought of the place because it is quiet and because I can get up and\r\ndown easily. I am sorry that I ever came to live in this house."\r\n\r\n"Why do you say that, Ferdinand?"\r\n\r\n"Because you and your father make cabals behind my back. If there is\r\nanything I hate it is that kind of thing."\r\n\r\n"You are very unjust," she said to him sobbing. "I have never\r\ncaballed. I have never done anything against you. Of course papa\r\nought to know."\r\n\r\n"Why ought he to know? Why is your father to have the right of\r\ninquiry into all my private affairs?"\r\n\r\n"Because you want his assistance. It is only natural. You always tell\r\nme to get him to assist you. He spoke most kindly, saying that he\r\nwould like to know how the things are."\r\n\r\n"Then he won\'t know. As for wanting his assistance, of course I\r\nwant the fortune which he ought to give you. He is man of the world\r\nenough to know that as I am in business capital must be useful to\r\nme. I should have thought that you would understand as much as that\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"I do understand it, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t you act as my friend rather than his? Why don\'t you\r\ntake my part? It seems to me that you are much more his daughter than\r\nmy wife."\r\n\r\n"That is most unfair."\r\n\r\n"If you had any pluck you would make him understand that for your\r\nsake he ought to say what he means to do, so that I might have the\r\nadvantage of the fortune which I suppose he means to give you some\r\nday. If you had the slightest anxiety to help me you could influence\r\nhim. Instead of that you talk to him about my poverty. I don\'t want\r\nhim to think that I am a pauper. That\'s not the way to get round\r\na man like your father, who is rich himself and who thinks it a\r\ndisgrace in other men not to be rich too."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell him in the same breath that you are rich and that you\r\nwant money."\r\n\r\n"Money is the means by which men make money. If he was confident of\r\nmy business he\'d shell out his cash quick enough! It is because he\r\nhas been taught to think that I am in a small way. He\'ll find his\r\nmistake some day."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t speak to him then?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that at all. If I find that it will answer my own\r\npurpose I shall speak to him. But it would be very much easier to me\r\nif I could get you to be cordial in helping me."\r\n\r\nEmily by this time quite knew what such cordiality meant. He had been\r\nso free in his words to her that there could be no mistake. He had\r\ninstructed her to "get round" her father. And now again he spoke\r\nof her influence over her father. Although her illusions were all\r\nmelting away,--oh, so quickly vanishing,--still she knew that it was\r\nher duty to be true to her husband, and to be his wife rather than\r\nher father\'s daughter. But what could she say on his behalf, knowing\r\nnothing of his affairs? She had no idea what was his business, what\r\nwas his income, what amount of money she ought to spend as his\r\nwife. As far as she could see,--and her common sense in seeing such\r\nthings was good,--he had no regular income, and was justified in no\r\nexpenditure. On her own account she would ask for no information. She\r\nwas too proud to request that from him which should be given to her\r\nwithout any request. But in her own defence she must tell him that\r\nshe could use no influence with her father as she knew none of the\r\ncircumstances by which her father would be guided. "I cannot help you\r\nin the manner you mean," she said, "because I know nothing myself."\r\n\r\n"You know that you can trust me to do the best with your money if I\r\ncould get hold of it, I suppose?" She certainly did not know this,\r\nand held her tongue. "You could assure him of that?"\r\n\r\n"I could only tell him to judge for himself."\r\n\r\n"What you mean is that you\'d see me d----d before you would open your\r\nmouth for me to the old man!"\r\n\r\nHe had never sworn at her before, and now she burst out into a flood\r\nof tears. It was to her a terrible outrage. I do not know that a\r\nwoman is very much the worse because her husband may forget himself\r\non an occasion and "rap out an oath at her," as he would call it when\r\nmaking the best of his own sin. Such an offence is compatible with\r\nuniform kindness and most affectionate consideration. I have known\r\nladies who would think little or nothing about it,--who would go no\r\nfarther than the mildest protest,--"Do remember where you are!" or,\r\n"My dear John!"--if no stranger were present. But then a wife should\r\nbe initiated into it by degrees; and there are different tones of\r\nbad language, of which by far the most general is the good-humoured\r\ntone. We all of us know men who never damn their servants, or any\r\ninferiors, or strangers, or women,--who in fact keep it all for\r\ntheir bosom friends; and if a little does sometimes flow over in\r\nthe freedom of domestic life, the wife is apt to remember that she\r\nis the bosomest of her husband\'s friends, and so to pardon the\r\ntransgression. But here the word had been uttered with all its\r\nfoulest violence, with virulence and vulgarity. It seemed to the\r\nvictim to be the sign of a terrible crisis in her early married\r\nlife,--as though the man who had so spoken to her could never again\r\nlove her, never again be kind to her, never again be sweetly gentle\r\nand like a lover. And as he spoke it he looked at her as though he\r\nwould like to tear her limbs asunder. She was frightened as well as\r\nhorrified and astounded. She had not a word to say to him. She did\r\nnot know in what language to make her complaint of such treatment.\r\nShe burst into tears, and throwing herself on the sofa hid her face\r\nin her hands. "You provoke me to be violent," he said. But still she\r\ncould not speak to him. "I come away from the city, tired with work\r\nand troubled with a thousand things, and you have not a kind word to\r\nsay to me." Then there was a pause, during which she still sobbed.\r\n"If your father has anything to say to me, let him say it. I shall\r\nnot run away. But as to going to him of my own accord with a story as\r\nlong as my arm about my own affairs, I don\'t mean to do it." Then he\r\npaused a moment again. "Come, old girl, cheer up! Don\'t pretend to\r\nbe broken-hearted because I used a hard word. There are worse things\r\nthan that to be borne in the world."\r\n\r\n"I--I--I was so startled, Ferdinand."\r\n\r\n"A man can\'t always remember that he isn\'t with another man. Don\'t\r\nthink anything more about it; but do bear this in mind,--that,\r\nsituated as we are, your influence with your father may be the making\r\nor the marring of me." And so he left the room.\r\n\r\nShe sat for the next ten minutes thinking of it all. The words which\r\nhe had spoken were so horrible that she could not get them out of her\r\nmind,--could not bring herself to look upon them as a trifle. The\r\ndarkness of his countenance still dwelt with her,--and that absence\r\nof all tenderness, that coarse un-marital and yet marital roughness,\r\nwhich should not at any rate have come to him so soon. The whole man\r\ntoo was so different from what she had thought him to be. Before\r\ntheir marriage no word as to money had ever reached her ears from\r\nhis lips. He had talked to her of books,--and especially of poetry.\r\nShakespeare and Moliere, Dante and Goethe, had been or had seemed\r\nto be dear to him. And he had been full of fine ideas about women,\r\nand about men in their intercourse with women. For his sake she had\r\nseparated herself from all her old friends. For his sake she had\r\nhurried into a marriage altogether distasteful to her father. For\r\nhis sake she had closed her heart against that other lover. Trusting\r\naltogether in him she had ventured to think that she had known what\r\nwas good for her better than all those who had been her counsellors,\r\nand had given herself to him utterly. Now she was awake; her dream\r\nwas over, and the natural language of the man was still ringing in\r\nher ears!\r\n\r\nThey met together at dinner and passed the evening without a further\r\nallusion to the scene which had been acted. He sat with a magazine\r\nin his hand, every now and then making some remark intended to be\r\npleasant but which grated on her ears as being fictitious. She would\r\nanswer him,--because it was her duty to do so, and because she would\r\nnot condescend to sulk; but she could not bring herself even to say\r\nto herself that all should be with her as though that horrid word had\r\nnot been spoken. She sat over her work till ten, answering him when\r\nhe spoke in a voice which was also fictitious, and then took herself\r\noff to her bed that she might weep alone. It would, she knew, be late\r\nbefore he would come to her.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning there came a message to him as he was dressing.\r\nMr. Wharton wished to speak to him. Would he come down before\r\nbreakfast, or would he call on Mr. Wharton in Stone Buildings? He\r\nsent down word that he would do the latter at an hour he fixed, and\r\nthen did not show himself in the breakfast-room till Mr. Wharton was\r\ngone. "I\'ve got to go to your father to-day," he said to his wife,\r\n"and I thought it best not to begin till we come to the regular\r\nbusiness. I hope he does not mean to be unreasonable." To this she\r\nmade no answer. "Of course you think the want of reason will be all\r\non my side."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should say so."\r\n\r\n"Because I can read your mind. You do think so. You\'ve been in the\r\nsame boat with your father all your life, and you can\'t get out of\r\nthat boat and get into mine. I was wrong to come and live here.\r\nOf course it was not the way to withdraw you from his influence."\r\nShe had nothing to say that would not anger him, and was therefore\r\nsilent. "Well; I must do the best I can by myself, I suppose.\r\nGood-bye," and so he was off.\r\n\r\n"I want to know," said Mr. Wharton, on whom was thrown by\r\npremeditation on the part of Lopez the task of beginning the\r\nconversation,--"I want to know what is the nature of your operation.\r\nI have never been quite able to understand it."\r\n\r\n"I do not know that I quite understand it myself," said Lopez,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"No man alive," continued the old barrister almost solemnly, "has a\r\ngreater objection to thrust himself into another man\'s affairs than\r\nI have. And as I didn\'t ask the question before your marriage,--as\r\nperhaps I ought to have done,--I should not do so now, were it not\r\nthat the disposition of some part of the earnings of my life must\r\ndepend on the condition of your affairs." Lopez immediately perceived\r\nthat it behoved him to be very much on the alert. It might be that\r\nif he showed himself to be very poor, his father-in-law would see\r\nthe necessity of assisting him at once; or, it might be, that\r\nunless he could show himself to be in prosperous circumstances,\r\nhis father-in-law would not assist him at all. "To tell you the\r\nplain truth, I am minded to make a new will. I had of course made\r\narrangements as to my property before Emily\'s marriage. Those\r\narrangements I think I shall now alter. I am greatly distressed with\r\nEverett; and from what I see and from a few words which have dropped\r\nfrom Emily, I am not, to tell you the truth, quite happy as to your\r\nposition. If I understand rightly you are a general merchant, buying\r\nand selling goods in the market?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s about it, sir."\r\n\r\n"What capital have you in the business?"\r\n\r\n"What capital?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--how much did you put into it at starting?"\r\n\r\nLopez paused a moment. He had got his wife. The marriage could not\r\nbe undone. Mr. Wharton had money enough for them all, and would not\r\ncertainly discard his daughter. Mr. Wharton could place him on a\r\nreally firm footing, and might not improbably do so if he could be\r\nmade to feel some confidence in his son-in-law. At this moment there\r\nwas much doubt with the son-in-law whether he had better not tell the\r\nsimple truth. "It has gone in by degrees," he said. "Altogether I\r\nhave had about L8000 in it." In truth he had never been possessed of\r\na shilling.\r\n\r\n"Does that include the L3000 you had from me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it does."\r\n\r\n"Then you have married my girl and started into the world with a\r\nbusiness based on L5000, and which had so far miscarried that within\r\na month or two after your marriage you were driven to apply to me for\r\nfunds!"\r\n\r\n"I wanted money for a certain purpose."\r\n\r\n"Have you any partner, Mr. Lopez?" This address was felt to be very\r\nominous.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I have a partner who is possessed of capital. His name is\r\nParker."\r\n\r\n"Then his capital is your capital."\r\n\r\n"Well;--I can\'t explain it, but it is not so."\r\n\r\n"What is the name of your firm?"\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t a registered name."\r\n\r\n"Have you a place of business?"\r\n\r\n"Parker has a place of business in Little Tankard Yard."\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton turned to a directory and found out Parker\'s name. "Mr.\r\nParker is a stockbroker. Are you also a stockbroker?"\r\n\r\n"No,--I am not."\r\n\r\n"Then, sir, it seems to me that you are a commercial adventurer."\r\n\r\n"I am not at all ashamed of the name, Mr. Wharton. According to your\r\nmanner of reckoning, half the business in the City of London is done\r\nby commercial adventurers. I watch the markets and buy goods,--and\r\nsell them at a profit. Mr. Parker is a moneyed man, who happens also\r\nto be a stockbroker. We can very easily call ourselves merchants, and\r\nput up the names of Lopez and Parker over the door."\r\n\r\n"Do you sign bills together?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"As Lopez and Parker?"\r\n\r\n"No. I sign them and he signs them. I trade also by myself, and so, I\r\nbelieve, does he."\r\n\r\n"One other question, Mr. Lopez. On what income have you paid\r\nincome-tax for the last three years?"\r\n\r\n"On L2000 a-year," said Lopez. This was a direct lie.\r\n\r\n"Can you make out any schedule showing your exact assets and\r\nliabilities at the present time?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I can."\r\n\r\n"Then do so, and send it to me before I go into Herefordshire. My\r\nwill as it stands at present would not be to your advantage. But I\r\ncannot change it till I know more of your circumstances than I do\r\nnow." And so the interview was over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nMrs. Sexty Parker\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Wharton and Lopez met every day for the next week, nothing\r\nmore was said about the schedule. The old man was thinking about\r\nit every day, and so also was Lopez. But Mr. Wharton had made his\r\ndemand, and, as he thought, nothing more was to be said on the\r\nsubject. He could not continue the subject as he would have done\r\nwith his son. But as day after day passed by he became more and more\r\nconvinced that his son-in-law\'s affairs were not in a state which\r\ncould bear to see the light. He had declared his purpose of altering\r\nhis will in the man\'s favour, if the man would satisfy him. And yet\r\nnothing was done and nothing was said.\r\n\r\nLopez had come among them and robbed him of his daughter. Since the\r\nman had become intimate in his house he had not known an hour\'s\r\nhappiness. The man had destroyed all the plans of his life, broken\r\nthrough into his castle, and violated his very hearth. No doubt he\r\nhimself had vacillated. He was aware of that, and in his present mood\r\nwas severe enough in judging himself. In his desolation he had tried\r\nto take the man to his heart,--had been kind to him, and had even\r\nopened his house to him. He had told himself that as the man was the\r\nhusband of his daughter he had better make the best of it. He had\r\nendeavoured to make the best of it, but between him and the man there\r\nwere such differences that they were poles asunder. And now it became\r\nclear to him that the man was, as he had declared to the man\'s face,\r\nno better than an adventurer!\r\n\r\nBy his will as it at present stood he had left two-thirds of his\r\nproperty to Everett, and one-third to his daughter, with arrangements\r\nfor settling her share on her children, should she be married and\r\nhave children at the time of his death. This will had been made many\r\nyears ago, and he had long since determined to alter it, in order\r\nthat he might divide his property equally between his children;--but\r\nhe had postponed the matter, intending to give a large portion of\r\nEmily\'s share to her directly on her marriage with Arthur Fletcher.\r\nShe had not married Arthur Fletcher;--but still it was necessary that\r\na new will should be made.\r\n\r\nWhen he left town for Herefordshire he had not yet made up his mind\r\nhow this should be done. He had at one time thought that he would\r\ngive some considerable sum to Lopez at once, knowing that to a man in\r\nbusiness such assistance would be useful. And he had not altogether\r\nabandoned that idea, even when he had asked for the schedule. He did\r\nnot relish the thought of giving his hard-earned money to Lopez, but,\r\nstill, the man\'s wife was his daughter, and he must do the best that\r\nhe could for her. Her taste in marrying the man was inexplicable\r\nto him. But that was done;--and now how might he best arrange his\r\naffairs so as to serve her interests?\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of August he went to Herefordshire and she to the\r\nseaside in Essex,--to the little place which Lopez had selected.\r\nBefore the end of the month the father-in-law wrote a line to his\r\nson-in-law.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR LOPEZ, [not without premeditation had he departed\r\n   from the sternness of that "Mr. Lopez," which in his anger\r\n   he had used at his chambers]--\r\n\r\n   When we were discussing your affairs I asked you for a\r\n   schedule of your assets and liabilities. I can make no new\r\n   arrangement of my property till I receive this. Should I\r\n   die leaving my present will as the instrument under which\r\n   my property would be conveyed to my heirs, Emily\'s share\r\n   would go into the hands of trustees for the use of herself\r\n   and her possible children. I tell you this that you may\r\n   understand that it is for your own interest to comply with\r\n   my requisition.\r\n\r\n   Yours,\r\n\r\n   A. WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course questions were asked him as to how the newly married couple\r\nwere getting on. At Wharton these questions were mild and easily put\r\noff. Sir Alured was contented with a slight shake of his head, and\r\nLady Wharton only remarked for the fifth or sixth time that "it was\r\na pity." But when they all went to Longbarns, the difficulty became\r\ngreater. Arthur was not there, and old Mrs. Fletcher was in full\r\nstrength. "So the Lopezes have come to live with you in Manchester\r\nSquare?" Mr. Wharton acknowledged that it was so with an affirmative\r\ngrunt. "I hope he\'s a pleasant inmate." There was a scorn in the old\r\nwoman\'s voice as she said this, which ought to have provoked any man.\r\n\r\n"More so than most men would be," said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"He is courteous and forbearing, and does not think that everything\r\naround him should be suited to his own peculiar fancies."\r\n\r\n"I am glad that you are contented with the marriage, Mr. Wharton."\r\n\r\n"Who has said that I am contented with it? No one ought to\r\nunderstand or to share my discontent so cordially as yourself, Mrs.\r\nFletcher;--and no one ought to be more chary of speaking of it.\r\nYou and I had hoped other things, and old people do not like to be\r\ndisappointed. But I needn\'t paint the devil blacker than he is."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid that, as usual, he is rather black."\r\n\r\n"Mother," said John Fletcher, "the thing has been done and you might\r\nas well let it be. We are all sorry that Emily has not come nearer\r\nto us; but she has had a right to choose for herself, and I for one\r\nwish,--as does my brother also,--that she may be happy in the lot she\r\nhas chosen."\r\n\r\n"His conduct to Arthur at Silverbridge was so nice!" said the\r\npertinacious old woman.\r\n\r\n"Never mind his conduct, mother. What is it to us?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well, John; but according to that nobody is to talk\r\nabout anybody."\r\n\r\n"I would much prefer, at any rate," said Mr. Wharton, "that you would\r\nnot talk about Mr. Lopez in my hearing."\r\n\r\n"Oh; if that is to be so, let it be so. And now I understand where\r\nI am." Then the old woman shook herself, and endeavoured to look as\r\nthough Mr. Wharton\'s soreness on the subject were an injury to her as\r\nrobbing her of a useful topic.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like Lopez, you know," Mr. Wharton said to John Fletcher\r\nafterwards. "How would it be possible that I should like such a man?\r\nBut there can be no good got by complaints. It is not what your\r\nmother suffers, or what even I may suffer,--or worse again, what\r\nArthur may suffer, that makes the sadness of all this. What will be\r\nher life? That is the question. And it is too near me, too important\r\nto me, for the endurance either of scorn or pity. I was glad that you\r\nasked your mother to be silent."\r\n\r\n"I can understand it," said John. "I do not think that she will\r\ntrouble you again."\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Lopez received Mr. Wharton\'s letter at Dovercourt,\r\nand had to consider what answer he should give to it. No answer\r\ncould be satisfactory,--unless he could impose a false answer on his\r\nfather-in-law so as to make it credible. The more he thought of it,\r\nthe more he believed that this would be impossible. The cautious\r\nold lawyer would not accept unverified statements. A certain sum of\r\nmoney,--by no means illiberal as a present,--he had already extracted\r\nfrom the old man. What he wanted was a further and a much larger\r\ngrant. Though Mr. Wharton was old he did not want to have to wait for\r\nthe death even of an old man. The next two or three years,--probably\r\nthe very next year,--might be the turning-point of his life. He had\r\nmarried the girl, and ought to have the girl\'s fortune,--down on\r\nthe nail! That was his idea; and the old man was robbing him in\r\nnot acting up to it. As he thought of this he cursed his ill luck.\r\nThe husbands of other girls had their fortunes conveyed to them\r\nimmediately on their marriage. What would not L20,000 do for him, if\r\nhe could get it into his hand? And so he taught himself to regard\r\nthe old man as a robber and himself as a victim. Who among us is\r\nthere that does not teach himself the same lesson? And then too how\r\ncruelly, how damnably he had been used by the Duchess of Omnium! And\r\nnow Sexty Parker, whose fortune he was making for him, whose fortune\r\nhe at any rate intended to make, was troubling him in various ways.\r\n"We\'re in a boat together," Sexty had said. "You\'ve had the use of my\r\nmoney, and by heavens you have it still. I don\'t see why you should\r\nbe so stiff. Do you bring your missus to Dovercourt, and I\'ll take\r\nmine, and let \'em know each other." There was a little argument on\r\nthe subject, but Sexty Parker had the best of it, and in this way the\r\ntrip to Dovercourt was arranged.\r\n\r\nLopez was in a very good humour when he took his wife down, and he\r\nwalked her round the terraces and esplanades of that not sufficiently\r\nwell-known marine paradise, now bidding her admire the sea and now\r\nlaughing at the finery of the people, till she became gradually\r\nfilled with an idea that as he was making himself pleasant, she also\r\nought to do the same. Of course she was not happy. The gilding had so\r\ncompletely and so rapidly been washed off her idol that she could not\r\nbe very happy. But she also could be good-humoured. "And now," said\r\nhe, smiling, "I have got something for you to do for me,--something\r\nthat you will find very disagreeable."\r\n\r\n"What is it? It won\'t be very bad, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n"It will be very bad, I\'m afraid. My excellent but horribly vulgar\r\npartner, Mr. Sextus Parker, when he found that I was coming here,\r\ninsisted on bringing his wife and children here also. I want you to\r\nknow them."\r\n\r\n"Is that all? She must be very bad indeed if I can\'t put up with\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"In one sense she isn\'t bad at all. I believe her to be an excellent\r\nwoman, intent on spoiling her children and giving her husband a good\r\ndinner every day. But I think you\'ll find that she is,--well,--not\r\nquite what you call a lady."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t mind that in the least. I\'ll help her to spoil the\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\n"You can get a lesson there, you know," he said, looking into her\r\nface. The little joke was one which a young wife might take with\r\npleasure from her husband, but her life had already been too much\r\nembittered for any such delight. Yes; the time was coming when that\r\ntrouble also would be added to her. She dreaded she knew not what,\r\nand had often told herself that it would be better that she should be\r\nchildless.\r\n\r\n"Do you like him?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Like him. No;--I can\'t say I like him. He is useful, and in one\r\nsense honest."\r\n\r\n"Is he not honest in all senses?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a large order. To tell you the truth, I don\'t know any man\r\nwho is."\r\n\r\n"Everett is honest."\r\n\r\n"He loses money at play which he can\'t pay without assistance from\r\nhis father. If his father had refused, where would then have been his\r\nhonesty? Sexty is as honest as others, I dare say, but I shouldn\'t\r\nlike to trust him much farther than I can see him. I shan\'t go up to\r\ntown to-morrow, and we\'ll both look in on them after luncheon."\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the call was made. The Parkers, having children, had\r\ndined early, and he was sitting out in a little porch smoking his\r\npipe, drinking whisky and water, and looking at the sea. His eldest\r\ngirl was standing between his legs, and his wife, with the other\r\nthree children round her, was sitting on the doorstep. "I\'ve brought\r\nmy wife to see you," said Lopez, holding out his hand to Mrs. Parker,\r\nas she rose from the ground.\r\n\r\n"I told her that you\'d be coming," said Sexty, "and she wanted me\r\nto put off my pipe and little drop of drink; but I said that if\r\nMrs. Lopez was the lady I took her to be she wouldn\'t begrudge a\r\nhard-working fellow his pipe and glass on a holiday."\r\n\r\nThere was a soundness of sense in this which mollified any feeling of\r\ndisgust which Emily might have felt at the man\'s vulgarity. "I think\r\nyou are quite right, Mr. Parker. I should be very sorry if,--if--"\r\n\r\n"If I was to put my pipe out. Well, I won\'t. You\'ll take a glass of\r\nsherry, Lopez? Though I\'m drinking spirits myself, I brought down a\r\nhamper of sherry wine. Oh, nonsense;--you must take something. That\'s\r\nright, Jane. Let us have the stuff and the glasses, and then they can\r\ndo as they like." Lopez lit a cigar, and allowed his host to pour\r\nout for him a glass of "sherry wine," while Mrs. Lopez went into the\r\nhouse with Mrs. Parker and the children.\r\n\r\nMrs. Parker opened herself out to her new friend immediately. She\r\nhoped that they two might see "a deal of each other;--that is, if\r\nyou don\'t think me too pushing." Sextus, she said, was so much away,\r\ncoming down to Dovercourt only every other day! And then, within the\r\nhalf hour which was consumed by Lopez with his cigar, the poor woman\r\ngot upon the general troubles of her life. Did Mrs. Lopez think that\r\n"all this speckelation was just the right thing?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that I know anything about it, Mrs. Parker."\r\n\r\n"But you ought;--oughtn\'t you, now? Don\'t you think that a wife ought\r\nto know what it is that her husband is after;--specially if there\'s\r\nchildren? A good bit of the money was mine, Mrs. Lopez; and though\r\nI don\'t begrudge it, not one bit, if any good is to come out of it\r\nto him or them, a woman doesn\'t like what her father has given her\r\nshould be made ducks and drakes of."\r\n\r\n"But are they making ducks and drakes?"\r\n\r\n"When he don\'t tell me I\'m always afeard. And I\'ll tell you what\r\nI know just as well as two and two. When he comes home a little\r\nflustered, and then takes more than his regular allowance, he\'s been\r\nat something as don\'t quite satisfy him. He\'s never that way when\r\nhe\'s done a good day\'s work at his regular business. He takes to the\r\nchildren then, and has one glass after his dinner, and tells me all\r\nabout it,--down to the shillings and pence. But it\'s very seldom he\'s\r\nthat way now."\r\n\r\n"You may think it very odd, Mrs. Parker, but I don\'t in the least\r\nknow what my husband is--in business."\r\n\r\n"And you never ask?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been very long married, you know;--only about ten months."\r\n\r\n"I\'d had my fust by that time."\r\n\r\n"Only nine months, I think, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Well; I wasn\'t very long after that. But I took care to know what it\r\nwas he was a-doing of in the city long before that time. And I did\r\nuse to know everything, till--" She was going to say, till Lopez had\r\ncome upon the scene. But she did not wish, at any rate as yet, to be\r\nharsh to her new friend.\r\n\r\n"I hope it is all right," said Emily.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes he\'s as though the Bank of England was all his own. And\r\nthere\'s been more money come into the house;--that I must say. And\r\nthere isn\'t an open-handeder one than Sexty anywhere. He\'d like to\r\nsee me in a silk gown every day of my life;--and as for the children,\r\nthere\'s nothing smart enough for them. Only I\'d sooner have a little\r\nand safe, than anything ever so fine, and never be sure whether it\r\nwasn\'t going to come to an end."\r\n\r\n"There I agree with you, quite."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose men feels it as we do; but, oh, Mrs. Lopez, give\r\nme a little, safe, so that I may know that I shan\'t see my children\r\nwant. When I thinks what it would be to have them darlings\' little\r\nbellies empty, and nothing in the cupboard, I get that low that I\'m\r\nnigh fit for Bedlam."\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the two men outside the porch were discussing their\r\naffairs in somewhat the same spirit. At last Lopez showed his friend\r\nWharton\'s letter, and told him of the expected schedule. "Schedule be\r\nd----d, you know," said Lopez. "How am I to put down a rise of 12s.\r\n6d. a ton on Kauri gum in a schedule? But when you come to 2000 tons\r\nit\'s L1250."\r\n\r\n"He\'s very old;--isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"But as strong as a horse."\r\n\r\n"He\'s got the money?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he has got it safe enough. There\'s no doubt about the money."\r\n\r\n"What he talks about is only a will. Now you want the money at once."\r\n\r\n"Of course I do;--and he talks to me as if I were some old fogy with\r\nan estate of my own. I must concoct a letter and explain my views;\r\nand the more I can make him understand how things really are the\r\nbetter. I don\'t suppose he wants to see his daughter come to grief."\r\n\r\n"Then the sooner you write it the better," said Mr. Parker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n"He Wants to Get Rich Too Quick"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they strolled home Lopez told his wife that he had accepted an\r\ninvitation to dine the next day at the Parkers\' cottage. In doing\r\nthis his manner was not quite so gentle as when he had asked her to\r\ncall on them. He had been a little ruffled by what had been said, and\r\nnow exhibited his temper. "I don\'t suppose it will be very nice," he\r\nsaid, "but we may have to put up with worse things than that."\r\n\r\n"I have made no objection."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t seem to take to it very cordially."\r\n\r\n"I had thought that I got on very well with Mrs. Parker. If you can\r\neat your dinner with them, I\'m sure that I can. You do not seem to\r\nlike him altogether, and I wish you had got a partner more to your\r\ntaste."\r\n\r\n"Taste, indeed! When you come to this kind of thing it isn\'t a matter\r\nof taste. The fact is that I am in that fellow\'s hands to an extent\r\nI don\'t like to think of, and don\'t see my way out of it unless your\r\nfather will do as he ought to do. You altogether refuse to help me\r\nwith your father, and you must, therefore, put up with Sexty Parker\r\nand his wife. It is quite on the cards that worse things may come\r\neven than Sexty Parker." To this she made no immediate answer, but\r\nwalked on, increasing her pace, not only unhappy, but also very\r\nangry. It was becoming a matter of doubt to her whether she could\r\ncontinue to bear these repeated attacks about her father\'s money. "I\r\nsee how it is," he continued. "You think that a husband should bear\r\nall the troubles of life, and that a wife should never be made to\r\nhear of them."\r\n\r\n"Ferdinand," she said, "I declare I did not think that any man could\r\nbe so unfair to a woman as you are to me."\r\n\r\n"Of course! Because I haven\'t got thousands a year to spend on you I\r\nam unfair."\r\n\r\n"I am content to live in any way that you may direct. If you are\r\npoor, I am satisfied to be poor. If you are even ruined, I am content\r\nto be ruined."\r\n\r\n"Who is talking about ruin?"\r\n\r\n"If you are in want of everything, I also will be in want and will\r\nnever complain. Whatever our joint lot may bring to us I will endure,\r\nand will endeavour to endure with cheerfulness. But I will not ask\r\nmy father for money, either for you or for myself. He knows what he\r\nought to do. I trust him implicitly."\r\n\r\n"And me not at all."\r\n\r\n"He is, I know, in communication with you about what should be done.\r\nI can only say,--tell him everything."\r\n\r\n"My dear, that is a matter in which it may be possible that I\r\nunderstand my own interest best."\r\n\r\n"Very likely. I certainly understand nothing, for I do not even know\r\nthe nature of your business. How can I tell him that he ought to give\r\nyou money?"\r\n\r\n"You might ask him for your own."\r\n\r\n"I have got nothing. Did I ever tell you that I had?"\r\n\r\n"You ought to have known."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that when you asked me to marry you I should have\r\nrefused you because I did not know what money papa would give me? Why\r\ndid you not ask papa?"\r\n\r\n"Had I known him then as well as I do now you may be quite sure that\r\nI should have done so."\r\n\r\n"Ferdinand, it will be better that we should not speak about my\r\nfather. I will in all things strive to do as you would have me, but I\r\ncannot hear him abused. If you have anything to say, go to Everett."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--when he is such a gambler that your father won\'t even speak\r\nto him. Your father will be found dead in his bed some day, and all\r\nhis money will have been left to some cursed hospital." They were at\r\ntheir own door when this was said, and she, without further answer,\r\nwent up to her bedroom.\r\n\r\nAll these bitter things had been said, not because Lopez had thought\r\nthat he could further his own views by saying them;--he knew indeed\r\nthat he was injuring himself by every display of ill-temper;--but\r\nshe was in his power, and Sexty Parker was rebelling. He thought a\r\ngood deal that day on the delight he would have in "kicking that\r\nill-conditioned cur," if only he could afford to kick him. But his\r\nwife was his own, and she must be taught to endure his will, and must\r\nbe made to know that though she was not to be kicked, yet she was to\r\nbe tormented and ill-used. And it might be possible that he should so\r\ncow her spirit as to bring her to act as he should direct. Still, as\r\nhe walked alone along the sea-shore, he knew that it would be better\r\nfor him to control his temper.\r\n\r\nOn that evening he did write to Mr. Wharton,--as follows,--and he\r\ndated his letter from Little Tankard Yard, so that Mr. Wharton might\r\nsuppose that that was really his own place of business, and that he\r\nwas there, at his work:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n   You have asked for a schedule of my affairs, and I have\r\n   found it quite impossible to give it. As it was with\r\n   the merchants whom Shakespeare and the other dramatists\r\n   described,--so it is with me. My caravels are out at sea,\r\n   and will not always come home in time. My property at\r\n   this moment consists of certain shares of cargoes of jute,\r\n   Kauri gum, guano, and sulphur, worth altogether at the\r\n   present moment something over L26,000, of which Mr. Parker\r\n   possesses the half;--but then of this property only a\r\n   portion is paid for,--perhaps something more than a half.\r\n   For the other half our bills are in the market. But in\r\n   February next these articles will probably be sold for\r\n   considerably more than L30,000. If I had L5000 placed to\r\n   my credit now, I should be worth about L15,000 by the end\r\n   of next February. I am engaged in sundry other smaller\r\n   ventures, all returning profits;--but in such a condition\r\n   of things it is impossible that I should make a schedule.\r\n\r\n   I am undoubtedly in the condition of a man trading beyond\r\n   his capital. I have been tempted by fair offers, and\r\n   what I think I may call something beyond an average\r\n   understanding of such matters, to go into ventures beyond\r\n   my means. I have stretched my arm out too far. In such a\r\n   position it is not perhaps unnatural that I should ask a\r\n   wealthy father-in-law to assist me. It is certainly not\r\n   unnatural that I should wish him to do so.\r\n\r\n   I do not think that I am a mercenary man. When I married\r\n   your daughter I raised no question as to her fortune.\r\n   Being embarked in trade I no doubt thought that her\r\n   means,--whatever they might be,--would be joined to my\r\n   own. I know that a sum of L20,000, with my experience in\r\n   the use of money, would give us a noble income. But I\r\n   would not condescend to ask a question which might lead to\r\n   a supposition that I was marrying her for her money and\r\n   not because I loved her.\r\n\r\n   You now know, I think, all that I can tell you. If there\r\n   be any other questions I would willingly answer them. It\r\n   is certainly the case that Emily\'s fortune, whatever you\r\n   may choose to give her, would be of infinitely greater use\r\n   to me now,--and consequently to her,--than at a future\r\n   date which I sincerely pray may be very long deferred.\r\n\r\n   Believe me to be,\r\n   Your affectionate son-in-law,\r\n\r\n   FERDINAND LOPEZ.\r\n\r\n   A. Wharton, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter he himself took up to town on the following day, and\r\nthere posted, addressing it to Wharton Hall. He did not expect very\r\ngreat results from it. As he read it over, he was painfully aware\r\nthat all his trash about caravels and cargoes of sulphur would not\r\ngo far with Mr. Wharton. But it might go farther than nothing. He\r\nwas bound not to neglect Mr. Wharton\'s letter to him. When a man\r\nis in difficulty about money, even a lie,--even a lie that is sure\r\nto be found out to be a lie,--will serve his immediate turn better\r\nthan silence. There is nothing that the courts hate so much as\r\ncontempt;--not even perjury. And Lopez felt that Mr. Wharton was the\r\njudge before whom he was bound to plead.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Dovercourt on that day, and he and his wife dined\r\nwith the Parkers. No woman of her age had known better what were\r\nthe manners of ladies and gentlemen than Emily Wharton. She had\r\nthoroughly understood that when in Herefordshire she was surrounded\r\nby people of that class, and that when she was with her aunt, Mrs.\r\nRoby, she was not quite so happily placed. No doubt she had been\r\nterribly deceived by her husband,--but the deceit had come from the\r\nfact that his manners gave no indication of his character. When she\r\nfound herself in Mrs. Parker\'s little sitting-room, with Mr. Parker\r\nmaking florid speeches to her, she knew that she had fallen among\r\npeople for whose society she had not been intended. But this was a\r\npart, and only a very trifling part, of the punishment which she felt\r\nthat she deserved. If that, and things like that, were all, she would\r\nbear them without a murmur.\r\n\r\n"Now I call Dovercourt a dooced nice little place," said Mr. Parker,\r\nas he helped her to the "bit of fish," which he told her he had\r\nbrought down with him from London.\r\n\r\n"It is very healthy, I should think."\r\n\r\n"Just the thing for the children, ma\'am. You\'ve none of your own,\r\nMrs. Lopez, but there\'s a good time coming. You were up to-day,\r\nweren\'t you, Lopez? Any news?"\r\n\r\n"Things seemed to be very quiet in the city."\r\n\r\n"Too quiet, I\'m afraid. I hate having \'em quiet. You must come and\r\nsee me in Little Tankard Yard some of these days, Mrs. Lopez. We\r\ncan give you a glass of cham. and the wing of a chicken;--can\'t we,\r\nLopez?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. It\'s more than you ever gave me," said Lopez, trying\r\nto look good-humoured.\r\n\r\n"But you ain\'t a lady."\r\n\r\n"Or me," said Mrs. Parker.\r\n\r\n"You\'re only a wife. If Mrs. Lopez will make a day of it we\'ll treat\r\nher well in the city;--won\'t we, Ferdinand?" A black cloud came\r\nacross "Ferdinand\'s" face, but he said nothing. Emily of a sudden\r\ndrew herself up, unconsciously,--and then at once relaxed her\r\nfeatures and smiled. If her husband chose that it should be so, she\r\nwould make no objection.\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour, Sexty, you are very familiar," said Mrs. Parker.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a way we have in the city," said Sexty. Sexty knew what he was\r\nabout. His partner called him Sexty, and why shouldn\'t he call his\r\npartner Ferdinand?\r\n\r\n"He\'ll call you Emily before long," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"When you call my wife Jane, I shall,--and I\'ve no objection in life.\r\nI don\'t see why people ain\'t to call each other by their Christian\r\nnames. Take a glass of champagne, Mrs. Lopez. I brought down\r\nhalf-a-dozen to-day so that we might be jolly. Care killed a cat.\r\nWhatever we call each other, I\'m very glad to see you here, Mrs.\r\nLopez, and I hope it\'s the first of a great many. Here\'s your\r\nhealth."\r\n\r\nIt was all his ordering, and if he bade her dine with a\r\ncrossing-sweeper she would do it. But she could not but remember that\r\nnot long since he had told her that his partner was not a person with\r\nwhom she could fitly associate; and she did not fail to perceive that\r\nhe must be going down in the world to admit such association for her\r\nafter he had so spoken. And as she sipped the mixture which Sexty\r\ncalled champagne, she thought of Herefordshire and the banks of the\r\nWye, and,--alas, alas,--she thought of Arthur Fletcher. Nevertheless,\r\ncome what might, she would do her duty, even though it might call\r\nupon her to sit at dinner with Mr. Parker three days in the week.\r\nLopez was her husband, and would be the father of her child, and she\r\nwould make herself one with him. It mattered not what people might\r\ncall him,--or even her. She had acted on her own judgment in marrying\r\nhim, and had been a fool; and now she would bear the punishment\r\nwithout complaint.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over Mrs. Parker helped the servant to remove the\r\ndinner things from the single sitting-room, and the two men went out\r\nto smoke their cigars in the covered porch. Mrs. Parker herself took\r\nout the whisky and hot water, and sugar and lemons, and then returned\r\nto have a little matronly discourse with her guest. "Does Mr. Lopez\r\never take a drop too much?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Never," said Mrs. Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it don\'t affect him as it do Sexty. He ain\'t a\r\ndrinker;--certainly not. And he\'s one that works hard every day of\r\nhis life. But he\'s getting fond of it these last twelve months, and\r\nthough he don\'t take very much it hurries him and flurries him. If I\r\nspeaks at night he gets cross;--and in the morning when he gets up,\r\nwhich he always do regular, though it\'s ever so bad with him, then I\r\nhaven\'t the heart to scold him. It\'s very hard sometimes for a wife\r\nto know what to do, Mrs. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed." Emily could not but think how soon she herself had\r\nlearned that lesson.\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'d do anything for Sexty,--the father of my bairns, and\r\nhas always been a good husband to me. You don\'t know him, of course,\r\nbut I do. A right good man at bottom;--but so weak!"\r\n\r\n"If he,--if he,--injures his health, shouldn\'t you talk to him\r\nquietly about it?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t the drink as is the evil, Mrs. Lopez, but that which makes\r\nhim drink. He\'s not one as goes a mucker merely for the pleasure.\r\nWhen things are going right he\'ll sit out in our arbour at home, and\r\nsmoke pipe after pipe, playing with the children, and one glass of\r\ngin and water cold will see him to bed. Tobacco, dry, do agree with\r\nhim, I think. But when he comes to three or four goes of hot toddy, I\r\nknow it\'s not as it should be."\r\n\r\n"You should restrain him, Mrs. Parker."\r\n\r\n"Of course I should;--but how? Am I to walk off with the bottle\r\nand disgrace him before the servant girl? Or am I to let the\r\nchildren know as their father takes too much? If I was as much as\r\nto make one fight of it, it\'d be all over Ponder\'s End that he\'s\r\na drunkard;--which he ain\'t. Restrain him;--oh, yes! If I could\r\nrestrain that gambling instead of regular business! That\'s what I\'d\r\nlike to restrain."\r\n\r\n"Does he gamble?"\r\n\r\n"What is it but gambling that he and Mr. Lopez is a-doing together?\r\nOf course, ma\'am, I don\'t know you, and you are different from me.\r\nI ain\'t foolish enough not to know all that. My father stood in\r\nSmithfield and sold hay, and your father is a gentleman as has been\r\nhigh up in the Courts all his life. But it\'s your husband is a-doing\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Parker!"\r\n\r\n"He is then. And if he brings Sexty and my little ones to the\r\nworkhouse, what\'ll be the good then of his guano and his gum?"\r\n\r\n"Is it not all in the fair way of commerce?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know about commerce, Mrs. Lopez, because I\'m only\r\na woman; but it can\'t be fair. They goes and buys things that they\r\nhaven\'t got the money to pay for, and then waits to see if they\'ll\r\nturn up trumps. Isn\'t that gambling?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say. I do not know." She felt now that her husband had\r\nbeen accused, and that part of the accusation had been levelled at\r\nherself. There was something in her manner of saying these few words\r\nwhich the poor complaining woman perceived, feeling immediately that\r\nshe had been inhospitable and perhaps unjust. She put out her hand\r\nsoftly, touching the other woman\'s arm, and looking up into her\r\nguest\'s face. "If this is so, it is terrible," said Emily.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I oughtn\'t to speak so free."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--for your children, and yourself, and your husband."\r\n\r\n"It\'s them,--and him. Of course it\'s not your doing, and Mr. Lopez,\r\nI\'m sure, is a very fine gentleman. And if he gets wrong one way,\r\nhe\'ll get himself right in another." Upon hearing this Emily shook\r\nher head. "Your papa is a rich man, and won\'t see you and yours come\r\nto want. There\'s nothing more to come to me or Sexty let it be ever\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"Why does he do it?"\r\n\r\n"Why does who do it?"\r\n\r\n"Your husband. Why don\'t you speak to him as you do to me, and tell\r\nhim to mind only his proper business?"\r\n\r\n"Now you are angry with me."\r\n\r\n"Angry! No;--indeed I am not angry. Every word that you say is good,\r\nand true, and just what you ought to say. I am not angry, but I am\r\nterrified. I know nothing of my husband\'s business. I cannot tell you\r\nthat you should trust to it. He is very clever, but--"\r\n\r\n"But--what, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I should say that he is ambitious."\r\n\r\n"You mean he wants to get rich too quick, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s just the same with Sexty. He\'s ambitious too. But what\'s\r\nthe good of being ambitious, Mrs. Lopez, if you never know whether\r\nyou\'re on your head or your heels? And what\'s the good of being\r\nambitious if you\'re to get into the workhouse? I know what that\r\nmeans. There\'s one or two of them sort of men gets into Parliament,\r\nand has houses as big as the Queen\'s palace, while hundreds of them\r\nhas their wives and children in the gutter. Who ever hears of them?\r\nNobody. It don\'t become any man to be ambitious who has got a wife\r\nand family. If he\'s a bachelor, why, of course, he can go to the\r\nColonies. There\'s Mary Jane and the two little ones right down on\r\nthe sea, with their feet in the salt water. Shall we put on our hats,\r\nMrs. Lopez, and go and look after them?" To this proposition Emily\r\nassented, and the two ladies went out after the children.\r\n\r\n"Mix yourself another glass," said Sexty to his partner.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather not. Don\'t ask me again. You know I never drink, and I\r\ndon\'t like being pressed."\r\n\r\n"By George!--You are particular."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of teasing a fellow to do a thing he doesn\'t like?"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t mind me having another?"\r\n\r\n"Fifty if you please, so that I\'m not forced to join you."\r\n\r\n"Forced! It\'s liberty \'all here, and you can do as you please. Only\r\nwhen a fellow will take a drop with me he\'s better company."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m d---- bad company, and you\'d better get somebody else to\r\nbe jolly with. To tell you the truth, Sexty, I suit you better at\r\nbusiness than at this sort of thing. I\'m like Shylock, you know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about Shylock, but I\'m blessed if I think you suit me\r\nvery well at anything. I\'m putting up with a deal of ill-usage, and\r\nwhen I try to be happy with you, you won\'t drink, and you tell me\r\nabout Shylock. He was a Jew, wasn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"That is the general idea."\r\n\r\n"Then you ain\'t very much like him, for they\'re a sort of people that\r\nalways have money about \'em."\r\n\r\n"How do you suppose he made his money to begin with? What an ass you\r\nare!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. I am. Ever since I began putting my name on the same\r\nbit of paper with yours I\'ve been an ass."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to be one a bit longer yet;--unless you mean to throw\r\nup everything. At this present moment you are six or seven thousand\r\npounds richer than you were before you first met me."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could see the money."\r\n\r\n"That\'s like you. What\'s the use of money you can see? How are you\r\nto make money out of money by looking at it? I like to know that my\r\nmoney is fructifying."\r\n\r\n"I like to know that it\'s all there,--and I did know it before I ever\r\nsaw you. I\'m blessed if I know it now. Go down and join the ladies,\r\nwill you? You ain\'t much of a companion up here."\r\n\r\nShortly after that Lopez told Mrs. Parker that he had already\r\nbade adieu to her husband, and then he took his wife to their own\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nAs for Love!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time spent by Mrs. Lopez at Dovercourt was by no means one of\r\ncomplete happiness. Her husband did not come down very frequently,\r\nalleging that his business kept him in town, and that the journey was\r\ntoo long. When he did come he annoyed her either by moroseness and\r\ntyranny, or by an affectation of loving good-humour, which was the\r\nmore disagreeable alternative of the two. She knew that he had no\r\nright to be good-humoured, and she was quite able to appreciate the\r\ndifference between fictitious love and love that was real. He did not\r\nwhile she was at Dovercourt speak to her again directly about her\r\nfather\'s money,--but he gave her to understand that he required from\r\nher very close economy. Then again she referred to the brougham which\r\nshe knew was to be in readiness on her return to London; but he told\r\nher that he was the best judge of that. The economy which he demanded\r\nwas that comfortless heart-rending economy which nips the practiser\r\nat every turn, but does not betray itself to the world at large. He\r\nwould have her save out of her washerwoman and linendraper, and yet\r\nhave a smart gown and go in a brougham. He begrudged her postage\r\nstamps, and stopped the subscription at Mudie\'s, though he insisted\r\non a front seat in the Dovercourt church, paying half a guinea more\r\nfor it than he would for a place at the side. And then before their\r\nsojourn at the place had come to an end he left her for awhile\r\nabsolutely penniless, so that when the butcher and baker called for\r\ntheir money she could not pay them. That was a dreadful calamity to\r\nher, and of which she was hardly able to measure the real worth. It\r\nhad never happened to her before to have to refuse an application for\r\nmoney that was due. In her father\'s house such a thing, as far as she\r\nknew, had never happened. She had sometimes heard that Everett was\r\nimpecunious, but that had simply indicated an additional call upon\r\nher father. When the butcher came the second time she wrote to her\r\nhusband in an agony. Should she write to her father for a supply? She\r\nwas sure that her father would not leave them in actual want. Then\r\nhe sent her a cheque, enclosed in a very angry letter. Apply to her\r\nfather! Had she not learned as yet that she was not to lean on her\r\nfather any longer, but simply on him? And was she such a fool as to\r\nsuppose that a tradesman could not wait a month for his money?\r\n\r\nDuring all this time she had no friend,--no person to whom she could\r\nspeak,--except Mrs. Parker. Mrs. Parker was very open and very\r\nconfidential about the business, really knowing very much more about\r\nit than did Mrs. Lopez. There was some sympathy and confidence\r\nbetween her and her husband, though they had latterly been much\r\nlessened by Sexty\'s conduct. Mrs. Parker talked daily about the\r\nbusiness now that her mouth had been opened, and was very clearly of\r\nopinion that it was not a good business. "Sexty don\'t think it good\r\nhimself," she said.\r\n\r\n"Then why does he go on with it?"\r\n\r\n"Business is a thing, Mrs. Lopez, as people can\'t drop out of just at\r\na moment. A man gets hisself entangled, and must free hisself as best\r\nhe can. I know he\'s terribly afeard;--and sometimes he does say such\r\nthings of your husband!" Emily shrunk almost into herself as she\r\nheard this. "You mustn\'t be angry, for indeed it\'s better you should\r\nknow all."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not angry; only very unhappy. Surely Mr. Parker could separate\r\nhimself from Mr. Lopez if he pleased?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I say to him. Give it up, though it be ever so much as\r\nyou\'ve to lose by him. Give it up, and begin again. You\'ve always got\r\nyour experience, and if it\'s only a crust you can earn, that\'s sure\r\nand safe. But then he declares that he means to pull through yet. I\r\nknow what men are at when they talk of pulling through, Mrs. Lopez.\r\nThere shouldn\'t be no need of pulling through. It should all come\r\njust of its own accord,--little and little; but safe." Then, when\r\nthe days of their marine holiday were coming to an end,--in the\r\nfirst week in October,--the day before the return of the Parkers to\r\nPonder\'s End, she made a strong appeal to her new friend. "You ain\'t\r\nafraid of him; are you?"\r\n\r\n"Of my husband?" said Mrs. Lopez. "I hope not. Why should you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Believe me, a woman should never be afraid of \'em. I never would\r\ngive in to be bullied and made little of by Sexty. I\'d do a\'most\r\nanything to make him comfortable, I\'m that soft-hearted. And why not,\r\nwhen he\'s the father of my children? But I\'m not going not to say a\r\nthing if I thinks it right, because I\'m afeard."\r\n\r\n"I think I could say anything if I thought it right."\r\n\r\n"Then tell him of me and my babes,--as how I can never have a quiet\r\nnight while this is going on. It isn\'t that they two men are fond of\r\none another. Nothing of the sort! Now you;--I\'ve got to be downright\r\nfond of you, though, of course, you think me common." Mrs. Lopez\r\nwould not contradict her, but stooped forward and kissed her cheek.\r\n"I\'m downright fond of you, I am," continued Mrs. Parker, snuffling\r\nand sobbing, "but they two men are only together because Mr. Lopez\r\nwants to gamble, and Parker has got a little money to gamble with."\r\nThis aspect of the thing was so terrible to Mrs. Lopez that she could\r\nonly weep and hide her face. "Now, if you would tell him just the\r\ntruth! Tell him what I say, and that I\'ve been a-saying it! Tell him\r\nit\'s for my children I\'m a-speaking, who won\'t have bread in their\r\nvery mouths if their father\'s squeezed dry like a sponge! Sure, if\r\nyou\'d tell him this, he wouldn\'t go on!" Then she paused a moment,\r\nlooking up into the other woman\'s face. "He\'d have some bowels of\r\ncompassion;--wouldn\'t he now?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try," said Mrs. Lopez.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'re good and kind-hearted, my dear. I saw it in your\r\neyes from the very first. But them men, when they get on at\r\nmoney-making,--or money-losing, which makes \'em worse,--are like\r\ntigers clawing one another. They don\'t care how many they kills, so\r\nthat they has the least bit for themselves. There ain\'t no fear of\r\nGod in it, nor yet no mercy, nor ere a morsel of heart. It ain\'t\r\nwhat I call manly,--not that longing after other folks\' money. When\r\nit\'s come by hard work, as I tell Sexty,--by the very sweat of his\r\nbrow,--oh,--it\'s sweet as sweet. When he\'d tell me that he\'d made his\r\nthree pound, or his five pound, or, perhaps, his ten pound in a day,\r\nand\'d calculate it up, how much it\'d come to if he did that every\r\nday, and where we could go to, and what we could do for the children,\r\nI loved to hear him talk about his money. But now--! why, it\'s\r\naltered the looks of the man altogether. It\'s just as though he was\r\na-thirsting for blood."\r\n\r\nThirsting for blood! Yes, indeed. It was the very idea that had\r\noccurred to Mrs. Lopez herself when her husband had bade her to "get\r\nround her father." No;--it certainly was not manly. There certainly\r\nwas neither fear of God in it, nor mercy. Yes;--she would try. But as\r\nfor bowels of compassion in Ferdinand Lopez--; she, the young wife,\r\nhad already seen enough of her husband to think that he was not to be\r\nmoved by any prayers on that side. Then the two women bade each other\r\nfarewell. "Parker has been talking of my going to Manchester Square,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Parker, "but I shan\'t. What\'d I be in Manchester Square?\r\nAnd, besides, there\'d better be an end of it. Mr. Lopez\'d turn Sexty\r\nand me out of the house at a moment\'s notice if it wasn\'t for the\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"It\'s papa\'s house," said Mrs. Lopez, not, however, meaning to make\r\nan attack on her husband.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so, but I shan\'t come to trouble no one; and we live ever\r\nso far away, at Ponder\'s End,--out of your line altogether, Mrs.\r\nLopez. But I\'ve taken to you, and will never think ill of you any\r\nway;--only do as you said you would."\r\n\r\n"I will try," said Mrs. Lopez.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Lopez had received from Mr. Wharton an answer to his\r\nletter about the missing caravels, which did not please him. Here is\r\nthe letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR LOPEZ,\r\n\r\n   I cannot say that your statement is satisfactory, nor can\r\n   I reconcile it to your assurance to me that you have made\r\n   a trade income for some years past of L2000 a year. I do\r\n   not know much of business, but I cannot imagine such a\r\n   result from such a condition of things as you describe.\r\n   Have you any books; and, if so, will you allow them to be\r\n   inspected by any accountant I may name?\r\n\r\n   You say that a sum of L20,000 would suit your business\r\n   better now than when I\'m dead. Very likely. But with such\r\n   an account of the business as that you have given me, I do\r\n   not know that I feel disposed to confide the savings of my\r\n   life to assist so very doubtful an enterprise. Of course\r\n   whatever I may do to your advantage will be done for the\r\n   sake of Emily and her children, should she have any. As\r\n   far as I can see at present, I shall best do my duty\r\n   to her, by leaving what I may have to leave to her, to\r\n   trustees, for her benefit and that of her children.\r\n\r\n   Yours truly,\r\n\r\n   A. WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, of course, did not tend to mollify the spirit of the man to\r\nwhom it was written, or to make him gracious towards his wife. He\r\nreceived the letter three weeks before the lodgings at Dovercourt\r\nwere given up,--but during these three weeks he was very little\r\nat the place, and when there did not mention the letter. On these\r\noccasions he said nothing about business, but satisfied himself with\r\ngiving strict injunctions as to economy. Then he took her back to\r\ntown on the day after her promise to Mrs. Parker that she would\r\n"try." Mrs. Parker had told her that no woman ought to be afraid to\r\nspeak to her husband, and, if necessary, to speak roundly on such\r\nsubjects. Mrs. Parker was certainly not a highly educated lady, but\r\nshe had impressed Emily with an admiration for her practical good\r\nsense and proper feeling. The lady who was a lady had begun to\r\nfeel that in the troubles of her life she might find a much less\r\nsatisfactory companion than the lady who was not a lady. She would do\r\nas Mrs. Parker had told her. She would not be afraid. Of course it\r\nwas right that she should speak on such a matter. She knew herself\r\nto be an obedient wife. She had borne all her unexpected sorrows\r\nwithout a complaint, with a resolve that she would bear all for his\r\nsake,--not because she loved him, but because she had made herself\r\nhis wife. Into whatever calamities he might fall, she would share\r\nthem. Though he should bring her utterly into the dirt, she would\r\nremain in the dirt with him. It seemed probable to her that it might\r\nbe so,--that they might have to go into the dirt;--and if it were\r\nso, she would still be true to him. She had chosen to marry him, and\r\nshe would be his true wife. But, as such, she would not be afraid of\r\nhim. Mrs. Parker had told her that "a woman should never be afraid\r\nof \'em," and she believed in Mrs. Parker. In this case, too, it was\r\nclearly her duty to speak,--for the injury being done was terrible,\r\nand might too probably become tragical. How could she endure to think\r\nof that woman and her children, should she come to know that the\r\nhusband of the woman and the father of the children had been ruined\r\nby her husband?\r\n\r\nYes,--she would speak to him. But she did fear. It is all very well\r\nfor a woman to tell herself that she will encounter some anticipated\r\ndifficulty without fear,--or for a man either. The fear cannot be\r\novercome by will. The thing, however, may be done, whether it be\r\nleading a forlorn hope, or speaking to an angry husband,--in spite\r\nof fear. She would do it; but when the moment for doing it came, her\r\nvery heart trembled within her. He had been so masterful with her,\r\nso persistent in repudiating her interference, so exacting in his\r\ndemands for obedience, so capable of making her miserable by his\r\nmoroseness when she failed to comply with his wishes, that she could\r\nnot go to her task without fear. But she did feel that she ought not\r\nto be afraid, or that her fears, at any rate, should not be allowed\r\nto restrain her. A wife, she knew, should be prepared to yield, but\r\nyet was entitled to be her husband\'s counsellor. And it was now the\r\ncase that in this matter she was conversant with circumstances which\r\nwere unknown to her husband. It was to her that Mrs. Parker\'s appeal\r\nhad been made, and with a direct request from the poor woman that it\r\nshould be repeated to her husband\'s partner.\r\n\r\nShe found that she could not do it on the journey home from\r\nDovercourt, nor yet on that evening. Mrs. Dick Roby, who had come\r\nback from a sojourn at Boulogne, was with them in the Square, and\r\nbrought her dear friend Mrs. Leslie with her, and also Lady Eustace.\r\nThe reader may remember that Mr. Wharton had met these ladies at\r\nMrs. Dick\'s house some months before his daughter\'s marriage, but he\r\ncertainly had never asked them into his own. On this occasion Emily\r\nhad given them no invitation, but had been told by her husband that\r\nher aunt would probably bring them in with her. "Mrs. Leslie and Lady\r\nEustace!" she exclaimed with a little shudder. "I suppose your aunt\r\nmay bring a couple of friends with her to see you, though it is your\r\nfather\'s house?" he had replied. She had said no more, not daring to\r\nhave a fight on that subject at present, while the other matter was\r\npressing on her mind. The evening had passed away pleasantly enough,\r\nshe thought, to all except herself. Mrs. Leslie and Lady Eustace\r\nhad talked a great deal, and her husband had borne himself quite\r\nas though he had been a wealthy man and the owner of the house in\r\nManchester Square. In the course of the evening Dick Roby came in and\r\nMajor Pountney, who since the late affairs at Silverbridge had become\r\nintimate with Lopez. So that there was quite a party; and Emily was\r\nastonished to hear her husband declare that he was only watching the\r\nopportunity of another vacancy in order that he might get into the\r\nHouse, and expose the miserable duplicity of the Duke of Omnium. And\r\nyet this man, within the last month, had taken away her subscription\r\nat Mudie\'s, and told her that she shouldn\'t wear things that wanted\r\nwashing! But he was able to say ever so many pretty little things to\r\nLady Eustace, and had given a new fan to Mrs. Dick, and talked of\r\ntaking a box for Mrs. Leslie at The Gaiety.\r\n\r\nBut on the next morning before breakfast she began. "Ferdinand," she\r\nsaid, "while I was at Dovercourt I saw a good deal of Mrs. Parker."\r\n\r\n"I could not help that. Or rather you might have helped it if you\r\npleased. It was necessary that you should meet, but I didn\'t tell you\r\nthat you were to see a great deal of her."\r\n\r\n"I liked her very much."\r\n\r\n"Then I must say you\'ve got a very odd taste. Did you like him?"\r\n\r\n"No. I did not see so much of him, and I think that the manners of\r\nwomen are less objectionable than those of men. But I want to tell\r\nyou what passed between her and me."\r\n\r\n"If it is about her husband\'s business she ought to have held her\r\ntongue, and you had better hold yours now."\r\n\r\nThis was not a happy beginning, but still she was determined to go\r\non. "It was I think more about your business than his."\r\n\r\n"Then it was infernal impudence on her part, and you should not have\r\nlistened to her for a moment."\r\n\r\n"You do not want to ruin her and her children!"\r\n\r\n"What have I to do with her and her children? I did not marry her,\r\nand I am not their father. He has got to look to that."\r\n\r\n"She thinks that you are enticing him into risks which he cannot\r\nafford."\r\n\r\n"Am I doing anything for him that I ain\'t doing for myself! If there\r\nis money made, will not he share it? If money has to be lost, of\r\ncourse he must do the same." Lopez in stating his case omitted to\r\nsay that whatever capital was now being used belonged to his partner.\r\n"But women when they get together talk all manner of nonsense. Is it\r\nlikely that I shall alter my course of action because you tell me\r\nthat she tells you that he tells her that he is losing money? He is a\r\nhalf-hearted fellow who quails at every turn against him. And when he\r\nis crying drunk I dare say he makes a poor mouth to her."\r\n\r\n"I think, Ferdinand, it is more than that. She says that--"\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth, Emily, I don\'t care a d---- what she says.\r\nNow give me some tea."\r\n\r\nThe roughness of this absolutely quelled her. It was not now that\r\nshe was afraid of him,--not at this moment, but that she was knocked\r\ndown as though by a blow. She had been altogether so unused to such\r\nlanguage that she could not get on with her matter in hand, letting\r\nthe bad word pass by her as an unmeaning expletive. She wearily\r\npoured out the cup of tea and sat herself down silent. The man was\r\ntoo strong for her, and would be so always. She told herself at this\r\nmoment that language such as that must always absolutely silence her.\r\nThen, within a few minutes, he desired her, quite cheerfully, to ask\r\nher uncle and aunt to dinner the day but one following, and also to\r\nask Lady Eustace and Mrs. Leslie. "I will pick up a couple of men,\r\nwhich will make us all right," he said.\r\n\r\nThis was in every way horrible to her. Her father had been back in\r\ntown, had not been very well, and had been recommended to return\r\nto the country. He had consequently removed himself,--not to\r\nHerefordshire,--but to Brighton, and was now living at an hotel,\r\nalmost within an hour of London. Had he been at home he certainly\r\nwould not have invited Mrs. Leslie and Lady Eustace to his house. He\r\nhad often expressed a feeling of dislike to the former lady in the\r\nhearing of his son-in-law, and had ridiculed his sister-in-law for\r\nallowing herself to be made acquainted with Lady Eustace, whose name\r\nhad at one time been very common in the mouths of people. Emily also\r\nfelt that she was hardly entitled to give a dinner-party in his house\r\nin his absence. And, after all that she had lately heard about her\r\nhusband\'s poverty, she could not understand how he should wish to\r\nincur the expense. "You would not ask Mrs. Leslie here!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Why should we not ask Mrs. Leslie?"\r\n\r\n"Papa dislikes her."\r\n\r\n"But \'papa,\' as you call him, isn\'t going to meet her."\r\n\r\n"He has said that he doesn\'t know what day he may be home. And he\r\ndoes more than dislike her. He disapproves of her."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! She is your aunt\'s friend. Because your father once heard\r\nsome cock-and-bull story about her, and because he has always taken\r\nupon himself to criticise your aunt\'s friends, I am not to be civil\r\nto a person I like."\r\n\r\n"But, Ferdinand, I do not like her myself. She never was in this\r\nhouse till the other night."\r\n\r\n"Look here, my dear, Lady Eustace can be useful to me, and I cannot\r\nask Lady Eustace without asking her friend. You do as I bid you,--or\r\nelse I shall do it myself."\r\n\r\nShe paused for a moment, and then she positively refused. "I cannot\r\nbring myself to ask Mrs. Leslie to dine in this house. If she comes\r\nto dine with you, of course I shall sit at the table, but she will be\r\nsure to see that she is not welcome."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that you are determined to go against me in\r\neverything I propose."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you would say that if you knew how miserable you made\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I tell you that that other woman can be very useful to me."\r\n\r\n"In what way useful?"\r\n\r\n"Are you jealous, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not of Lady Eustace,--nor of any woman. But it seems so\r\nodd that such a person\'s services should be required."\r\n\r\n"Will you do as I tell you, and ask them? You can go round and tell\r\nyour aunt about it. She knows that I mean to ask them. Lady Eustace\r\nis a very rich woman, and is disposed to do a little in commerce. Now\r\ndo you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least," said Emily.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t a woman who has money buy coffee as well as buy\r\nshares?"\r\n\r\n"Does she buy shares?"\r\n\r\n"By George, Emily, I think that you\'re a fool."\r\n\r\n"I dare say I am, Ferdinand. I do not in the least know what it all\r\nmeans. But I do know this, that you ought not, in papa\'s absence, to\r\nask people to dine here whom he particularly dislikes, and whom he\r\nwould not wish to have in his house."\r\n\r\n"You think that I am to be governed by you in such a matter as that?"\r\n\r\n"I do not want to govern you."\r\n\r\n"You think that a wife should dictate to a husband as to the way in\r\nwhich he is to do his work, and the partners he may be allowed to\r\nhave in his business, and the persons whom he may ask to dinner!\r\nBecause you have been dictating to me on all these matters. Now, look\r\nhere, my dear. As to my business, you had better never speak to me\r\nabout it any more. I have endeavoured to take you into my confidence\r\nand to get you to act with me, but you have declined that, and have\r\npreferred to stick to your father. As to my partners, whether I may\r\nchoose to have Sexty Parker or Lady Eustace, I am a better judge\r\nthan you. And as to asking Mrs. Leslie and Lady Eustace or any other\r\npersons to dinner, as I am obliged to make even the recreations of\r\nlife subservient to its work, I must claim permission to have my own\r\nway." She had listened, but when he paused she made no reply. "Do you\r\nmean to do as I bid you and ask these ladies?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot do that. I know that it ought not to be done. This is\r\npapa\'s house, and we are living here as his guests."\r\n\r\n"D---- your papa!" he said as he burst out of the room. After a\r\nquarter of an hour he put his head again into the room and saw her\r\nsitting, like a statue, exactly where he had left her. "I have\r\nwritten the notes both to Lady Eustace and to Mrs. Leslie," he said.\r\n"You can\'t think it any sin at any rate to ask your aunt."\r\n\r\n"I will see my aunt," she said.\r\n\r\n"And remember I am not going to be your father\'s guest, as you call\r\nit. I mean to pay for the dinner myself, and to send in my own wines.\r\nYour father shall have nothing to complain of on that head."\r\n\r\n"Could you not ask them to Richmond, or to some hotel?" she said.\r\n\r\n"What; in October! If you think that I am going to live in a house in\r\nwhich I can\'t invite a friend to dinner, you are mistaken." And with\r\nthat he took his departure.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing had now become so horrible to her that she felt\r\nunable any longer to hold up her head. It seemed to her to be\r\nsacrilege that these women should come and sit in her father\'s room;\r\nbut when she spoke of her father her husband had cursed him with\r\nscorn! Lopez was going to send food and wine into the house, which\r\nwould be gall and wormwood to her father. At one time she thought she\r\nwould at once write to her father and tell him of it all,--or perhaps\r\ntelegraph to him; but she could not do so without letting her husband\r\nknow what she had done, and then he would have justice on his side in\r\ncalling her disobedient. Were she to do that, then it would indeed be\r\nnecessary that she should take part against her husband.\r\n\r\nShe had brought all this misery on herself and on her father because\r\nshe had been obstinate in thinking that she could with certainty\r\nread a lover\'s character. As for love,--that of course had died\r\naway in her heart,--imperceptibly, though, alas, so quickly! It was\r\nimpossible that she could continue to love a man who from day to day\r\nwas teaching her mean lessons, and who was ever doing mean things,\r\nthe meanness of which was so little apparent to himself that he did\r\nnot scruple to divulge them to her. How could she love a man who\r\nwould make no sacrifice either to her comfort, her pride, or her\r\nconscience? But still she might obey him,--if she could feel sure\r\nthat obedience to him was a duty. Could it be a duty to sin against\r\nher father\'s wishes, and to assist in profaning his house and abusing\r\nhis hospitality after this fashion? Then her mind again went back to\r\nthe troubles of Mrs. Parker, and her absolute inefficiency in that\r\nmatter. It seemed to her that she had given herself over body and\r\nsoul and mind to some evil genius, and that there was no escape.\r\n\r\n"Of course we\'ll come," Mrs. Roby had said to her when she went round\r\nthe corner into Berkeley Street early in the day. "Lopez spoke to me\r\nabout it before."\r\n\r\n"What will papa say about it, Aunt Harriet?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he and Lopez understand each other."\r\n\r\n"I do not think papa will understand this."\r\n\r\n"I am sure Mr. Wharton would not lend his house to his son-in-law,\r\nand then object to the man he had lent it to asking a friend to dine\r\nwith him. And I am sure that Mr. Lopez would not consent to occupy a\r\nhouse on those terms. If you don\'t like it, of course we won\'t come."\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t say that. As these other women are to come, pray do not\r\ndesert me. But I cannot say I think it is right." Mrs. Dick, however,\r\nonly laughed at her scruples.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening Emily got letters addressed to herself\r\nfrom Lady Eustace and Mrs. Leslie, informing her that they would\r\nhave very much pleasure in dining with her on the day named. And\r\nLady Eustace went on to say, with much pleasantry, that she always\r\nregarded little parties, got up without any ceremony, as being the\r\npleasantest, and that she should come on this occasion without any\r\nceremonial observance. Then Emily was aware that her husband had not\r\nonly written the notes in her name, but had put into her mouth some\r\nstudied apology as to the shortness of the invitation. Well! She was\r\nthe man\'s wife, and she supposed that he was entitled to put any\r\nwords that he pleased into her mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n"Has He Ill-treated You?"\r\n\r\n\r\nLopez relieved his wife from all care as to provision for his guests.\r\n"I\'ve been to a shop in Wigmore Street," he said, "and everything\r\nwill be done. They\'ll send in a cook to make the things hot, and your\r\nfather won\'t have to pay even for a crust of bread."\r\n\r\n"Papa doesn\'t mind paying for anything," she said in her indignation.\r\n\r\n"It is all very pretty for you to say so, but my experience of him\r\ngoes just the other way. At any rate there will be nothing to be paid\r\nfor. Stewam and Sugarscraps will send in everything, if you\'ll only\r\ntell the old fogies downstairs not to interfere." Then she made a\r\nlittle request. Might she ask Everett, who was now in town? "I\'ve\r\nalready got Major Pountney and Captain Gunner," he said. She pleaded\r\nthat one more would make no difference. "But that\'s just what one\r\nmore always does. It destroys everything, and turns a pretty little\r\ndinner into an awkward feed. We won\'t have him this time. Pountney\'ll\r\ntake you, and I\'ll take her ladyship. Dick will take Mrs. Leslie, and\r\nGunner will have Aunt Harriet. Dick will sit opposite to me, and the\r\nfour ladies will sit at the four corners. We shall be very pleasant,\r\nbut one more would spoil us."\r\n\r\nShe did speak to the "old fogies" downstairs,--the housekeeper, who\r\nhad lived with her father since she was a child, and the butler, who\r\nhad been there still longer, and the cook, who, having been in her\r\nplace only three years, resigned impetuously within half-an-hour\r\nafter the advent of Mr. Sugarscraps\' head man. The "fogies" were\r\nindignant. The butler expressed his intention of locking himself up\r\nin his own peculiar pantry, and the housekeeper took upon herself to\r\ntell her young mistress that "Master wouldn\'t like it." Since she had\r\nknown Mr. Wharton such a thing as cooked food being sent into the\r\nhouse from a shop had never been so much as heard of. Emily, who had\r\nhitherto been regarded in the house as a rather strong-minded young\r\nwoman, could only break down and weep. Why, oh why, had she consented\r\nto bring herself and her misery into her father\'s house? She could\r\nat any rate have prevented that by explaining to her father the\r\nunfitness of such an arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe "party" came. There was Major Pountney, very fine, rather loud,\r\nvery intimate with the host, whom on one occasion he called "Ferdy,\r\nmy boy," and very full of abuse of the Duke and Duchess of Omnium.\r\n"And yet she was a good creature when I knew her," said Lady Eustace.\r\nPountney suggested that the Duchess had not then taken up politics.\r\n"I\'ve got out of her way," said Lady Eustace, "since she did that."\r\nAnd there was Captain Gunner, who defended the Duchess, but who\r\nacknowledged that the Duke was the "most consumedly stuck-up\r\ncox-comb" then existing. "And the most dishonest," said Lopez, who\r\nhad told his new friends nothing about the repayment of the election\r\nexpenses. And Dick was there. He liked these little parties, in which\r\na good deal of wine could be drunk, and at which ladies were not\r\nsupposed to be very stiff. The Major and the Captain, and Mrs. Leslie\r\nand Lady Eustace, were such people as he liked,--all within the pale,\r\nbut having a piquant relish of fastness and impropriety. Dick was\r\nwont to declare that he hated the world in buckram. Aunt Harriet was\r\ntriumphant in a manner which disgusted Emily, and which she thought\r\nto be most disrespectful to her father;--but in truth Aunt Harriet\r\ndid not now care very much for Mr. Wharton, preferring the friendship\r\nof Mr. Wharton\'s son-in-law. Mrs. Leslie came in gorgeous clothes,\r\nwhich, as she was known to be very poor, and to have attached herself\r\nlately with almost more than feminine affection to Lady Eustace, were\r\nat any rate open to suspicious cavil. In former days Mrs. Leslie had\r\ntaken upon herself to say bitter things about Mr. Lopez, which Emily\r\ncould now have repeated, to that lady\'s discomfiture, had such a mode\r\nof revenge suited her disposition. With Mrs. Leslie there was Lady\r\nEustace, pretty as ever, and sharp and witty, with the old passion\r\nfor some excitement, the old proneness to pretend to trust everybody,\r\nand the old incapacity for trusting anybody. Ferdinand Lopez had\r\nlately been at her feet, and had fired her imagination with stories\r\nof the grand things to be done in trade. Ladies do it? Yes; why not\r\nwomen as well as men? Any one might do it who had money in his pocket\r\nand experience to tell him, or to tell her, what to buy and what to\r\nsell. And the experience, luckily, might be vicarious. At the present\r\nmoment half the jewels worn in London were,--if Ferdinand Lopez knew\r\nanything about it,--bought from the proceeds of such commerce. Of\r\ncourse there were misfortunes. But these came from a want of that\r\nexperience which Ferdinand Lopez possessed, and which he was quite\r\nwilling to place at the service of one whom he admired so thoroughly\r\nas he did Lady Eustace. Lady Eustace had been charmed, had seen her\r\nway into a new and most delightful life,--but had not yet put any of\r\nher money into the hands of Ferdinand Lopez.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that the dinner was good. It may be a doubt whether such\r\ntradesmen as Messrs. Stewam and Sugarscraps do ever produce good\r\nfood;--or whether, with all the will in the world to do so, such\r\na result is within their power. It is certain, I think, that the\r\nhumblest mutton chop is better eating than any "Supreme of chicken\r\nafter martial manner,"--as I have seen the dish named in a French\r\nbill of fare, translated by a French pastrycook for the benefit\r\nof his English customers,--when sent in from Messrs. Stewam and\r\nSugarscraps even with their best exertions. Nor can it be said that\r\nthe wine was good, though Mr. Sugarscraps, when he contracted for the\r\nwhole entertainment, was eager in his assurance that he procured the\r\nvery best that London could produce. But the outside look of things\r\nwas handsome, and there were many dishes, and enough of servants\r\nto hand them, and the wines, if not good, were various. Probably\r\nPountney and Gunner did not know good wines. Roby did, but was\r\ncontented on this occasion to drink them bad. And everything went\r\npleasantly, with perhaps a little too much noise;--everything except\r\nthe hostess, who was allowed by general consent to be sad and\r\nsilent;--till there came a loud double-rap at the door.\r\n\r\n"There\'s papa," said Emily, jumping up from her seat.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dick looked at Lopez, and saw at a glance that for a moment his\r\ncourage had failed him. But he recovered himself quickly. "Hadn\'t you\r\nbetter keep your seat, my dear?" he said to his wife. "The servants\r\nwill attend to Mr. Wharton, and I will go to him presently."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Emily, who by this time was almost at the door.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t expect him,--did you?" asked Dick Roby.\r\n\r\n"Nobody knew when he was coming. I think he told Emily that he might\r\nbe here any day."\r\n\r\n"He\'s the most uncertain man alive," said Mrs. Dick, who was a good\r\ndeal scared by the arrival, though determined to hold up her head and\r\nexhibit no fear.\r\n\r\n"I suppose the old gentleman will come in and have some dinner,"\r\nwhispered Captain Gunner to his neighbour Mrs. Leslie.\r\n\r\n"Not if he knows I\'m here," replied Mrs. Leslie, tittering. "He\r\nthinks that I am,--oh, something a great deal worse than I can tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Is he given to be cross?" asked Lady Eustace, also affecting to\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n"Never saw him in my life," answered the Major, "but I shouldn\'t\r\nwonder if he was. Old gentlemen generally are cross. Gout, and that\r\nkind of thing, you know."\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two the servants stopped their ministrations,\r\nand things were very uncomfortable; but Lopez, as soon as he had\r\nrecovered himself, directed Mr. Sugarscraps\' men to proceed with the\r\nbanquet. "We can eat our dinner, I suppose, though my father-in-law\r\nhas come back," he said. "I wish my wife was not so fussy, though\r\nthat is a kind of thing, Lady Eustace, that one has to expect from\r\nyoung wives." The banquet did go on, but the feeling was general that\r\na misfortune had come upon them, and that something dreadful might\r\npossibly happen.\r\n\r\nEmily, when she rushed out, met her father in the hall, and ran into\r\nhis arms. "Oh, papa!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this about?" he asked, and as he spoke he passed on\r\nthrough the hall to his own room at the back of the house. There were\r\nof course many evidences on all sides of the party,--the strange\r\nservants, the dishes going in and out, the clatter of glasses, and\r\nthe smell of viands. "You\'ve got a dinner-party," he said. "Had you\r\nnot better go back to your friends?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa."\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, Emily? You are unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, so unhappy!"\r\n\r\n"What is it all about? Who are they? Whose doing is it,--yours or\r\nhis? What makes you unhappy?"\r\n\r\nHe was now seated in his arm-chair, and she threw herself on her\r\nknees at his feet. "He would have them. You mustn\'t be angry with me.\r\nYou won\'t be angry with me;--will you?"\r\n\r\nHe put his hand upon her head, and stroked her hair. "Why should I\r\nbe angry with you because your husband has asked friends to dinner?"\r\nShe was so unlike her usual self that he knew not what to make of it.\r\nIt had not been her nature to kneel and to ask for pardon, or to be\r\ntimid and submissive. "What is it, Emily, that makes you like this?"\r\n\r\n"He shouldn\'t have had the people."\r\n\r\n"Well;--granted. But it does not signify much. Is your aunt Harriet\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be very bad, then."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Leslie is there, and Lady Eustace,--and two men I don\'t like."\r\n\r\n"Is Everett here?"\r\n\r\n"No;--he wouldn\'t have Everett."\r\n\r\n"Oughtn\'t you to go to them?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make me go. I should only cry. I have been crying all day, and\r\nthe whole of yesterday." Then she buried her face upon his knees, and\r\nsobbed as though she would break her heart.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t at all understand it. Though he distrusted his\r\nson-in-law, and certainly did not love him, he had not as yet learned\r\nto hold him in aversion. When the connection was once made he had\r\ndetermined to make the best of it, and had declared to himself that\r\nas far as manners went the man was well enough. He had not as yet\r\nseen the inside of the man, as it had been the sad fate of the poor\r\nwife to see him. It had never occurred to him that his daughter\'s\r\nlove had failed her, or that she could already be repenting what she\r\nhad done. And now, when she was weeping at his feet and deploring the\r\nsin of the dinner-party,--which, after all, was a trifling sin,--he\r\ncould not comprehend the feelings which were actuating her. "I\r\nsuppose your aunt Harriet made up the party," he said.\r\n\r\n"He did it."\r\n\r\n"Your husband?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he did it. He wrote to the women in my name when I refused."\r\nThen Mr. Wharton began to perceive that there had been a quarrel. "I\r\ntold him Mrs. Leslie oughtn\'t to come here."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t love Mrs. Leslie,--nor, for the matter of that, Lady\r\nEustace. But they won\'t hurt the house, my dear."\r\n\r\n"And he has had the dinner sent in from a shop."\r\n\r\n"Why couldn\'t he let Mrs. Williams do it?" As he said this, the tone\r\nof his voice became for the first time angry.\r\n\r\n"Cook has gone away. She wouldn\'t stand it. And Mrs. Williams is very\r\nangry. And Barker wouldn\'t wait at table."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the meaning of it all?"\r\n\r\n"He would have it so. Oh, papa, you don\'t know what I\'ve undergone.\r\nI wish,--I wish we had not come here. It would have been better\r\nanywhere else."\r\n\r\n"What would have been better, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Everything. Whether we lived or died, it would have been better. Why\r\nshould I bring my misery to you? Oh, papa, you do not know,--you can\r\nnever know."\r\n\r\n"But I must know. Is there more than this dinner to disturb you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--more than that. Only I couldn\'t bear that it should be\r\ndone in your house."\r\n\r\n"Has he--ill-treated you?"\r\n\r\nThen she got up, and stood before him. "I do not mean to complain. I\r\nshould have said nothing only that you have found us in this way. For\r\nmyself I will bear it all, whatever it may be. But, papa, I want you\r\nto tell him that we must leave this house."\r\n\r\n"He has got no other home for you."\r\n\r\n"He must find one. I will go anywhere. I don\'t care where it is. But\r\nI won\'t stay here. I have done it myself, but I won\'t bring it upon\r\nyou. I could bear it all if I thought that you would never see me\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Emily!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--if you would never see me again. I know it all, and that would\r\nbe best." She was now walking about the room. "Why should you see it\r\nall?"\r\n\r\n"See what, my love?"\r\n\r\n"See his ruin, and my unhappiness, and my baby. Oh,--oh,--oh!"\r\n\r\n"I think so very differently, Emily, that under no circumstances will\r\nI have you taken to another home. I cannot understand much of all\r\nthis yet, but I suppose I shall come to see it. If Lopez be, as you\r\nsay, ruined, it is well that I have still enough for us to live on.\r\nThis is a bad time just now to talk about your husband\'s affairs."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to talk about them, papa."\r\n\r\n"What would you like best to do now,--now at once. Can you go down\r\nagain to your husband\'s friends?"\r\n\r\n"No;--no;--no."\r\n\r\n"As for the dinner, never mind about that. I can\'t blame him for\r\nmaking use of my house in my absence, as far as that goes,--though\r\nI wish he could have contented himself with such a dinner as my\r\nservants could have prepared for him. I will have some tea here."\r\n\r\n"Let me stay with you, papa, and make it for you."\r\n\r\n"Very well, dear. I do not mean to be ashamed to enter my own\r\ndining-room. I shall, therefore, go in and make your apologies."\r\nThereupon Mr. Wharton walked slowly forth and marched into the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Wharton," said Mrs. Dick, "we didn\'t expect you."\r\n\r\n"Have you dined yet, sir?" asked Lopez.\r\n\r\n"I dined early," said Mr. Wharton. "I should not now have come in to\r\ndisturb you, but that I have found Mrs. Lopez unwell, and she has\r\nbegged me to ask you to excuse her."\r\n\r\n"I will go to her," said Lopez, rising.\r\n\r\n"It is not necessary," said Wharton. "She is not ill, but hardly able\r\nto take her place at table." Then Mrs. Dick proposed to go to her\r\ndear niece; but Mr. Wharton would not allow it, and left the room,\r\nhaving succeeded in persuading them to go on with their dinner. Lopez\r\ncertainly was not happy during the evening, but he was strong enough\r\nto hide his misgivings, and to do his duty as host with seeming\r\ncheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n"Where Is Guatemala?"\r\n\r\n\r\nThough his daughter\'s words to him had been very wild they did almost\r\nmore to convince Mr. Wharton that he should not give his money to\r\nhis son-in-law than even the letters which had passed between them.\r\nTo Emily herself he spoke very little as to what had occurred that\r\nevening. "Papa," she said, "do not ask me anything more about it. I\r\nwas very miserable,--because of the dinner." Nor did he at that time\r\nask her any questions, contenting himself with assuring her that, at\r\nany rate at present, and till after her baby should have been born,\r\nshe must remain in Manchester Square. "He won\'t hurt me," said Mr.\r\nWharton, and then added with a smile, "He won\'t have to have any more\r\ndinner-parties while I am here."\r\n\r\nNor did he make any complaint to Lopez as to what had been done, or\r\neven allude to the dinner. But when he had been back about a week he\r\nannounced to his son-in-law his final determination as to money. "I\r\nhad better tell you, Lopez, what I mean to do, so that you may not be\r\nleft in doubt. I shall not intrust any further sum of money into your\r\nhands on behalf of Emily."\r\n\r\n"You can do as you please, sir,--of course."\r\n\r\n"Just so. You have had what to me is a very considerable sum,--though\r\nI fear that it did not go for much in your large concerns."\r\n\r\n"It was not very much, Mr. Wharton."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not. Opinions on such a matter differ, you know. At any\r\nrate, there will be no more. At present I wish Emily to live here,\r\nand you, of course, are welcome here also. If things are not going\r\nwell with you, this will, at any rate, relieve you from immediate\r\nexpense."\r\n\r\n"My calculations, sir, have never descended to that."\r\n\r\n"Mine are more minute. The necessities of my life have caused me to\r\nthink of these little things. When I am dead there will be provision\r\nfor Emily made by my will,--the income going to trustees for her\r\nbenefit, and the capital to her children after her death. I thought\r\nit only fair to you that this should be explained."\r\n\r\n"And you will do nothing for me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing;--if that is nothing. I should have thought that your\r\npresent maintenance and the future support of your wife and children\r\nwould have been regarded as something."\r\n\r\n"It is nothing;--nothing!"\r\n\r\n"Then let it be nothing. Good morning."\r\n\r\nTwo days after that Lopez recurred to the subject. "You were very\r\nexplicit with me the other day, sir."\r\n\r\n"I meant to be so."\r\n\r\n"And I will be equally so to you now. Both I and your daughter are\r\nabsolutely ruined unless you reconsider your purpose."\r\n\r\n"If you mean money by reconsideration,--present money to be given to\r\nyou,--I certainly shall not reconsider it. You may take my solemn\r\nassurance that I will give you nothing that can be of any service to\r\nyou in trade."\r\n\r\n"Then, sir,--I must tell you my purpose, and give you my assurance,\r\nwhich is equally solemn. Under those circumstances I must leave\r\nEngland, and try my fortune in Central America. There is an opening\r\nfor me at Guatemala, though not a very hopeful one."\r\n\r\n"Guatemala!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--friends of mine have a connection there. I have not broken it\r\nto Emily yet, but under these circumstances she will have to go."\r\n\r\n"You will not take her to Guatemala!"\r\n\r\n"Not take my wife, sir? Indeed I shall. Do you suppose that I would\r\ngo away and leave my wife a pensioner on your bounty? Do you think\r\nthat she would wish to desert her husband? I don\'t think you know\r\nyour daughter."\r\n\r\n"I wish you had never known her."\r\n\r\n"That is neither here nor there, sir. If I cannot succeed in this\r\ncountry I must go elsewhere. As I have told you before, L20,000 at\r\nthe present moment would enable me to surmount all my difficulties,\r\nand make me a very wealthy man. But unless I can command some such\r\nsum by Christmas everything here must be sacrificed."\r\n\r\n"Never in my life did I hear so base a proposition," said Mr.\r\nWharton.\r\n\r\n"Why is it base? I can only tell you the truth."\r\n\r\n"So be it. You will find that I mean what I have said."\r\n\r\n"So do I, Mr. Wharton."\r\n\r\n"As to my daughter, she must, of course, do as she thinks fit."\r\n\r\n"She must do as I think fit, Mr. Wharton."\r\n\r\n"I will not argue with you. Alas, alas; poor girl!"\r\n\r\n"Poor girl, indeed! She is likely to be a poor girl if she is treated\r\nin this way by her father. As I understand that you intend to use, or\r\nto try to use, authority over her, I shall take steps for removing\r\nher at once from your house." And so the interview was ended.\r\n\r\nLopez had thought the matter over, and had determined to "brazen it\r\nout," as he himself called it. Nothing further was, he thought, to be\r\ngot by civility and obedience. Now he must use his power. His idea\r\nof going to Guatemala was not an invention of the moment, nor was it\r\ndevoid of a certain basis of truth. Such a suggestion had been made\r\nto him some time since by Mr. Mills Happerton. There were mines in\r\nGuatemala which wanted, or at some future day might want, a resident\r\ndirector. The proposition had been made to Lopez before his marriage,\r\nand Mr. Happerton probably had now forgotten all about it;--but the\r\nthing was of service now. He broke the matter very suddenly to his\r\nwife. "Has your father been speaking to you of my plans?"\r\n\r\n"Not lately;--not that I remember."\r\n\r\n"He could not speak of them without your remembering, I should think.\r\nHas he told you that I am going to Guatemala?"\r\n\r\n"Guatemala! Where is Guatemala, Ferdinand?"\r\n\r\n"You can answer my question though your geography is deficient."\r\n\r\n"He has said nothing about your going anywhere."\r\n\r\n"You will have to go,--as soon after Christmas as you may be fit."\r\n\r\n"But where is Guatemala;--and for how long, Ferdinand?"\r\n\r\n"Guatemala is in Central America, and we shall probably settle there\r\nfor the rest of our lives. I have got nothing to live on here."\r\n\r\nDuring the next two months this plan of seeking a distant home and a\r\nstrange country was constantly spoken of in Manchester Square, and\r\ndid receive corroboration from Mr. Happerton himself. Lopez renewed\r\nhis application and received a letter from that gentleman saying\r\nthat the thing might probably be arranged if he were in earnest.\r\n"I am quite in earnest," Lopez said as he showed this letter to Mr.\r\nWharton. "I suppose Emily will be able to start two months after her\r\nconfinement. They tell me that babies do very well at sea."\r\n\r\nDuring this time, in spite of his threat, he continued to live\r\nwith Mr. Wharton in Manchester Square, and went every day into the\r\ncity,--whether to make arrangements and receive instructions as to\r\nGuatemala, or to carry on his old business, neither Emily nor her\r\nfather knew. He never at this time spoke about his affairs to either\r\nof them, but daily referred to her future expatriation as a thing\r\nthat was certain. At last there came up the actual question,--whether\r\nshe were to go or not. Her father told her that though she was\r\ndoubtless bound by law to obey her husband, in such a matter as this\r\nshe might defy the law. "I do not think that he can actually force\r\nyou on board the ship," her father said.\r\n\r\n"But if he tells me that I must go?"\r\n\r\n"Stay here with me," said the father. "Stay here with your baby. I\'ll\r\nfight it out for you. I\'ll so manage that you shall have all the\r\nworld on your side."\r\n\r\nEmily at that moment came to no decision, but on the following day\r\nshe discussed the matter with Lopez himself. "Of course you will go\r\nwith me," he said, when she asked the question.\r\n\r\n"You mean that I must, whether I wish to go or not."\r\n\r\n"Certainly you must. Good G----! where is a wife\'s place? Am I to go\r\nout without my child, and without you, while you are enjoying all\r\nthe comforts of your father\'s wealth at home? That is not my idea of\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Ferdinand, I have been thinking about it very much. I must beg you\r\nto allow me to remain. I ask it of you as if I were asking my life."\r\n\r\n"Your father has put you up to this."\r\n\r\n"No;--not to this."\r\n\r\n"To what then?"\r\n\r\n"My father thinks that I should refuse to go."\r\n\r\n"He does, does he?"\r\n\r\n"But I shall not refuse. I shall go if you insist upon it. There\r\nshall be no contest between us about that."\r\n\r\n"Well; I should hope not."\r\n\r\n"But I do implore you to spare me."\r\n\r\n"That is very selfish, Emily."\r\n\r\n"Yes,"--she said, "yes. I cannot contradict that. But so is the man\r\nselfish who prays the judge to spare his life."\r\n\r\n"But you do not think of me. I must go."\r\n\r\n"I shall not make you happier, Ferdinand."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that it is a fine thing for a man to live in such a\r\ncountry as that all alone?"\r\n\r\n"I think he would be better so than with a wife he does not--love."\r\n\r\n"Who says I do not love you?"\r\n\r\n"Or with one who does--not--love him." This she said very slowly,\r\nvery softly, but looking up into his eyes as she said it.\r\n\r\n"Do you tell me that to my face?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--what good can I do now by lying? You have not been to me as I\r\nthought you would be."\r\n\r\n"And so, because you have built up some castle in the air that has\r\nfallen to pieces, you tell your husband to his face that you do not\r\nlove him, and that you prefer not to live with him. Is that your idea\r\nof duty?"\r\n\r\n"Why have you been so cruel?"\r\n\r\n"Cruel! What have I done? Tell me what cruelty. Have I beat\r\nyou? Have you been starved? Have I not asked and implored your\r\nassistance,--only to be refused? The fact is that your father and you\r\nhave found out that I am not a rich man, and you want to be rid of\r\nme. Is that true or false?"\r\n\r\n"It is not true that I want to be rid of you because you are poor."\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to be rid of you. You will have to settle down and do\r\nyour work as my wife in whatever place it may suit me to live. Your\r\nfather is a rich man, but you shall not have the advantage of his\r\nwealth unless it comes to you, as it ought to come, through my hands.\r\nIf your father would give me the fortune which ought to be yours\r\nthere need be no going abroad. He cannot bear to part with his money,\r\nand therefore we must go. Now you know all about it." She was then\r\nturning to leave him, when he asked her a direct question. "Am I to\r\nunderstand that you intend to resist my right to take you with me?"\r\n\r\n"If you bid me go,--I shall go."\r\n\r\n"It will be better, as you will save both trouble and exposure."\r\n\r\nOf course she told her father what had taken place, but he could only\r\nshake his head, and sit groaning over his misery in his chambers.\r\nHe had explained to her what he was willing to do on her behalf, but\r\nshe declined his aid. He could not tell her that she was wrong. She\r\nwas the man\'s wife, and out of that terrible destiny she could not\r\nnow escape. The only question with him was whether it would not\r\nbe best to buy the man,--give him a sum of money to go, and to go\r\nalone. Could he have been quit of the man even for L20,000, he would\r\nwillingly have paid the money. But the man would either not go, or\r\nwould come back as soon as he had got the money. His own life, as he\r\npassed it now, with this man in the house with him, was horrible to\r\nhim. For Lopez, though he had more than once threatened that he would\r\ncarry his wife to another home, had taken no steps towards getting\r\nthat other home ready for her.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Mr. Wharton had not seen his son. Everett had\r\ngone abroad just as his father returned to London from Brighton, and\r\nwas still on the continent. He received his allowance punctually,\r\nand that was the only intercourse which took place between them. But\r\nEmily had written to him, not telling him much of her troubles,--only\r\nsaying that she believed that her husband would take her to Central\r\nAmerica early in the spring, and begging him to come home before she\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas her baby was born, but the poor child did not\r\nlive a couple of days. She herself at the time was so worn with care,\r\nso thin and wan and wretched, that looking in the glass she hardly\r\nknew her own face. "Ferdinand," she said to him, "I know he will not\r\nlive. The Doctor says so."\r\n\r\n"Nothing thrives that I have to do with," he answered gloomily.\r\n\r\n"Will you not look at him?"\r\n\r\n"Well; yes. I have looked at him, have I not? I wish to God that\r\nwhere he is going I could go with him."\r\n\r\n"I wish I was;--I wish I was going," said the poor mother. Then the\r\nfather went out, and before he had returned to the house the child\r\nwas dead. "Oh, Ferdinand, speak one kind word to me now," she said.\r\n\r\n"What kind word can I speak when you have told me that you do not\r\nlove me? Do you think that I can forget that because--because he has\r\ngone?"\r\n\r\n"A woman\'s love may always be won back again by kindness."\r\n\r\n"Psha! How am I to kiss and make pretty speeches with my mind\r\nharassed as it is now?" But he did touch her brow with his lips\r\nbefore he went away.\r\n\r\nThe infant was buried, and then there was not much show of mourning\r\nin the house. The poor mother would sit gloomily alone day after day,\r\ntelling herself that it was perhaps better that she should have been\r\nrobbed of her treasure than have gone forth with him into the wide,\r\nunknown, harsh world with such a father as she had given him. Then\r\nshe would look at all the preparations she had made,--the happy\r\nwork of her fingers when her thoughts of their future use were her\r\nsweetest consolation,--and weep till she would herself feel that\r\nthere never could be an end to her tears.\r\n\r\nThe second week in January had come and yet nothing further had been\r\nsettled as to this Guatemala project. Lopez talked about it as though\r\nit was certain, and even told his wife that as they would move so\r\nsoon it would not be now worth while for him to take other lodgings\r\nfor her. But when she asked as to her own preparations,--the wardrobe\r\nnecessary for the long voyage and her general outfit,--he told her\r\nthat three weeks or a fortnight would be enough for all, and that he\r\nwould give her sufficient notice. "Upon my word he is very kind to\r\nhonour my poor house as he does," said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"Papa, we will go at once if you wish it," said his daughter.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Emily; do not turn upon me. I cannot but be sensible to the\r\ninsult of his daily presence; but even that is better than losing\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThen there occurred a ludicrous incident,--or combination of\r\nincidents,--which, in spite of their absurdity, drove Mr. Wharton\r\nalmost frantic. First there came to him the bill from Messrs. Stewam\r\nand Sugarscraps for the dinner. At this time he kept nothing back\r\nfrom his daughter. "Look at that!" he said. The bill was absolutely\r\nmade out in his name.\r\n\r\n"It is a mistake, papa."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. The dinner was given in my house, and I must pay for\r\nit. I would sooner do so than that he should pay it,--even if he had\r\nthe means." So he paid Messrs. Stewam and Sugarscraps L25 9s. 6d.,\r\nbegging them as he did so never to send another dinner into his\r\nhouse, and observing that he was in the habit of entertaining his\r\nfriends at less than three guineas a head. "But Chateau Yquem and\r\nCote d\'Or!" said Mr. Sugarscraps. "Chateau fiddlesticks!" said Mr.\r\nWharton, walking out of the house with his receipt.\r\n\r\nThen came the bill for the brougham,--for the brougham from the very\r\nday of their return to town after their wedding trip. This he showed\r\nto Lopez. Indeed the bill had been made out to Lopez and sent to Mr.\r\nWharton with an apologetic note. "I didn\'t tell him to send it," said\r\nLopez.\r\n\r\n"But will you pay it?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall not ask you to pay it." But Mr. Wharton at last\r\ndid pay it, and he also paid the rent of the rooms in the Belgrave\r\nMansions, and between L30 and L40 for dresses which Emily had got at\r\nLewes and Allenby\'s under her husband\'s orders in the first days of\r\ntheir married life in London.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, I wish I had not gone there," she said.\r\n\r\n"My dear, anything that you may have had I do not grudge in the\r\nleast. And even for him, if he would let you remain here, I would pay\r\nwillingly. I would supply all his wants if he would only--go away."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nMr. Slide\'s Revenge\r\n\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say, my lady, that the Duke paid his electioneering\r\nbill down at Silverbridge?"\r\n\r\n"I do mean to say so, Mr. Slide." Lady Eustace nodded her head, and\r\nMr. Quintus Slide opened his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Goodness gracious!" said Mrs. Leslie, who was sitting with them.\r\nThey were in Lady Eustace\'s drawing-room, and the patriotic editor of\r\nthe "People\'s Banner" was obtaining from a new ally information which\r\nmight be useful to the country.\r\n\r\n"But \'ow do you know, Lady Eustace? You\'ll pardon the persistency of\r\nmy inquiries, but when you come to public information accuracy is\r\neverything. I never trust myself to mere report. I always travel up\r\nto the very fountain \'ead of truth."\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Lizzy Eustace oracularly.\r\n\r\n"Um--m!" The Editor as he ejaculated the sound looked at her ladyship\r\nwith admiring eyes,--with eyes that were intended to flatter. But\r\nLizzie had been looked at so often in so many ways, and was so well\r\naccustomed to admiration, that this had no effect on her at all. "\'E\r\ndidn\'t tell you himself; did \'e, now?"\r\n\r\n"Can you tell me the truth as to trusting him with my money?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can."\r\n\r\n"Shall I be safe if I take the papers which he calls bills of sale?"\r\n\r\n"One good turn deserves another, my lady."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to make a secret of it, Mr. Slide. Pountney found it\r\nout. You know the Major?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know Major Pountney. He was at Gatherum \'imself, and got a\r\nlittle bit of cold shoulder;--didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"I dare say he did. What has that to do with it? You may be sure that\r\nLopez applied to the Duke for his expenses at Silverbridge, and that\r\nthe Duke sent him the money."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt about it, Mr. Slide," said Mrs. Leslie. "We got it\r\nall from Major Pountney. There was some bet between him and Pountney,\r\nand he had to show Pountney the cheque."\r\n\r\n"Pountney saw the money," said Lady Eustace.\r\n\r\nMr. Slide stroked his hand over his mouth and chin as he sat thinking\r\nof the tremendous national importance of this communication. The man\r\nwho had paid the money was the Prime Minister of England,--and was,\r\nmoreover, Mr. Slide\'s enemy! "When the right \'and of fellowship has\r\nbeen rejected, I never forgive," Mr. Slide has been heard to say.\r\nEven Lady Eustace, who was not particular as to the appearance of\r\npeople, remarked afterwards to her friend that Mr. Slide had looked\r\nlike the devil as he was stroking his face. "It\'s very remarkable,"\r\nsaid Mr. Slide; "very remarkable!"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t tell the Major that we told you," said her Ladyship.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no. I only just wanted to \'ear how it was. And as to\r\nembarking your money, my lady, with Ferdinand Lopez,--I wouldn\'t do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Not if I get the bills of sale? It\'s for rum, and they say rum will\r\ngo up to any price."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Lady Eustace. I can\'t say any more,--but don\'t. I never\r\nmention names. But don\'t."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Slide went at once in search of Major Pountney, and having\r\nfound the Major at his club extracted from him all that he knew about\r\nthe Silverbridge payment. Pountney had really seen the Duke\'s cheque\r\nfor L500. "There was some bet,--eh, Major?" asked Mr. Slide.\r\n\r\n"No, there wasn\'t. I know who has been telling you. That\'s Lizzie\r\nEustace, and just like her mischief. The way of it was this;--Lopez,\r\nwho was very angry, had boasted that he would bring the Duke down on\r\nhis marrow-bones. I was laughing at him as we sat at dinner one day\r\nafterwards, and he took out the cheque and showed it me. There was\r\nthe Duke\'s own signature for L500,--\'Omnium,\' as plain as letters\r\ncould make it." Armed with this full information, Mr. Slide felt that\r\nhe had done all that the most punctilious devotion to accuracy could\r\ndemand of him, and immediately shut himself up in his cage at the\r\n"People\'s Banner" office and went to work.\r\n\r\nThis occurred about the first week in January. The Duke was then\r\nat Matching with his wife and a very small party. The singular\r\narrangement which had been effected by the Duchess in the early\r\nautumn had passed off without any wonderful effects. It had been done\r\nby her in pique, and the result had been apparently so absurd that it\r\nhad at first frightened her. But in the end it answered very well.\r\nThe Duke took great pleasure in Lady Rosina\'s company, and enjoyed\r\nthe comparative solitude which enabled him to work all day without\r\ninterruption. His wife protested that it was just what she liked,\r\nthough it must be feared that she soon became weary of it. To Lady\r\nRosina it was of course a Paradise on earth. In September, Phineas\r\nFinn and his wife came to them, and in October there were other\r\nrelaxations and other business. The Prime Minister and his wife\r\nvisited their Sovereign, and he made some very useful speeches\r\nthrough the country on his old favourite subject of decimal coinage.\r\nAt Christmas, for a fortnight, they went to Gatherum Castle and\r\nentertained the neighbourhood,--the nobility and squirearchy dining\r\nthere on one day, and the tenants and other farmers on another. All\r\nthis went very smoothly, and the Duke did not become outrageously\r\nunhappy because the "People\'s Banner" made sundry severe remarks on\r\nthe absence of Cabinet Councils through the autumn.\r\n\r\nAfter Christmas they returned to Matching, and had some of their old\r\nfriends with them. There was the Duke of St. Bungay and the Duchess,\r\nand Phineas Finn and his wife, and Lord and Lady Cantrip, Barrington\r\nErle, and one or two others. But at this period there came a great\r\ntrouble. One morning as the Duke sat in his own room after breakfast\r\nhe read an article in the "People\'s Banner," of which the following\r\nsentences were a part. "We wish to know by whom were paid the\r\nexpenses incurred by Mr. Ferdinand Lopez during the late contest\r\nat Silverbridge. It may be that they were paid by that gentleman\r\nhimself,--in which case we shall have nothing further to say, not\r\ncaring at the present moment to inquire whether those expenses were\r\nor were not excessive. It may be that they were paid by subscription\r\namong his political friends,--and if so, again we shall be satisfied.\r\nOr it is possible that funds were supplied by a new political club of\r\nwhich we have lately heard much, and with the action of such a body\r\nwe of course have nothing to do. If an assurance can be given to\r\nus by Mr. Lopez or his friends that such was the case we shall be\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n"But a report has reached us, and we may say more than a report,\r\nwhich makes it our duty to ask this question. Were those expenses\r\npaid out of the private pocket of the present Prime Minister? If\r\nso, we maintain that we have discovered a blot in that nobleman\'s\r\ncharacter which it is our duty to the public to expose. We will go\r\nfarther and say that if it be so,--if these expenses were paid out\r\nof the private pocket of the Duke of Omnium, it is not fit that that\r\nnobleman should any longer hold the high office which he now fills.\r\n\r\n"We know that a peer should not interfere in elections for the House\r\nof Commons. We certainly know that a Minister of the Crown should not\r\nattempt to purchase parliamentary support. We happen to know also the\r\nalmost more than public manner,--are we not justified in saying the\r\nostentation?--with which at the last election the Duke repudiated\r\nall that influence with the borough which his predecessors, and we\r\nbelieve he himself, had so long exercised. He came forward telling us\r\nthat he, at least, meant to have clean hands;--that he would not do\r\nas his forefathers had done;--that he would not even do as he himself\r\nhad done in former years. What are we to think of the Duke of Omnium\r\nas a Minister of this country, if, after such assurances, he has out\r\nof his own pocket paid the electioneering expenses of a candidate at\r\nSilverbridge?" There was much more in the article, but the passages\r\nquoted will suffice to give the reader a sufficient idea of the\r\naccusation made, and which the Duke read in the retirement of his own\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nHe read it twice before he allowed himself to think of the matter.\r\nThe statement made was at any rate true to the letter. He had paid\r\nthe man\'s electioneering expenses. That he had done so from the\r\npurest motives he knew and the reader knows;--but he could not even\r\nexplain those motives without exposing his wife. Since the cheque was\r\nsent he had never spoken of the occurrence to any human being,--but\r\nhe had thought of it very often. At the time his private Secretary,\r\nwith much hesitation, almost with trepidation, had counselled him not\r\nto send the money. The Duke was a man with whom it was very easy to\r\nwork, whose courtesy to all dependent on him was almost exaggerated,\r\nwho never found fault, and was anxious as far as possible to do\r\neverything for himself. The comfort of those around him was always\r\nmatter of interest to him. Everything he held, he held as it were in\r\ntrust for the enjoyment of others. But he was a man whom it was very\r\ndifficult to advise. He did not like advice. He was so thin-skinned\r\nthat any counsel offered to him took the form of criticism. When\r\ncautioned what shoes he should wear,--as had been done by Lady\r\nRosina, or what wine or what horses he should buy, as was done by his\r\nbutler and coachman, he was thankful, taking no pride to himself for\r\nknowledge as to shoes, wine, or horses. But as to his own conduct,\r\nprivate or public, as to any question of politics, as to his opinions\r\nand resolutions, he was jealous of interference. Mr. Warburton\r\ntherefore had almost trembled when asking the Duke whether he was\r\nquite sure about sending the money to Lopez. "Quite sure," the Duke\r\nhad answered, having at that time made up his mind. Mr. Warburton had\r\nnot dared to express a further doubt, and the money had been sent.\r\nBut from the moment of sending it doubts had repeated themselves in\r\nthe Prime Minister\'s mind.\r\n\r\nNow he sat with the newspaper in his hand thinking of it. Of course\r\nit was open to him to take no notice of the matter,--to go on as\r\nthough he had not seen the article, and to let the thing die if it\r\nwould die. But he knew Mr. Quintus Slide and his paper well enough to\r\nbe sure that it would not die. The charge would be repeated in the\r\n"People\'s Banner" till it was copied into other papers; and then the\r\nfurther question would be asked,--why had the Prime Minister allowed\r\nsuch an accusation to remain unanswered? But if he did notice it,\r\nwhat notice should he take of it? It was true. And surely he had a\r\nright to do what he liked with his own money so long as he disobeyed\r\nno law. He had bribed no one. He had spent his money with no corrupt\r\npurpose. His sense of honour had taught him to think that the man had\r\nreceived injury through his wife\'s imprudence, and that he therefore\r\nwas responsible as far as the pecuniary loss was concerned. He was\r\nnot ashamed of the thing he had done;--but yet he was ashamed that it\r\nshould be discussed in public.\r\n\r\nWhy had he allowed himself to be put into a position in which he was\r\nsubject to such grievous annoyance? Since he had held his office he\r\nhad not had a happy day, nor,--so he told himself,--had he received\r\nfrom it any slightest gratification, nor could he buoy himself up\r\nwith the idea that he was doing good service for his country. After\r\na while he walked into the next room and showed the paper to Mr.\r\nWarburton. "Perhaps you were right," he said, "when you told me not\r\nto send that money."\r\n\r\n"It will matter nothing," said the private Secretary when he had read\r\nit,--thinking, however, that it might matter much, but wishing to\r\nspare the Duke.\r\n\r\n"I was obliged to repay the man as the Duchess had--had encouraged\r\nhim. The Duchess had not quite--quite understood my wishes." Mr.\r\nWarburton knew the whole history now, having discussed it all with\r\nthe Duchess more than once.\r\n\r\n"I think your Grace should take no notice of the article."\r\n\r\nNo notice was taken of it, but three days afterwards there appeared a\r\nshort paragraph in large type,--beginning with a question. "Does the\r\nDuke of Omnium intend to answer the question asked by us last Friday?\r\nIs it true that he paid the expenses of Mr. Lopez when that gentleman\r\nstood for Silverbridge? The Duke may be assured that the question\r\nshall be repeated till it is answered." This the Duke also saw and\r\ntook to his private Secretary.\r\n\r\n"I would do nothing at any rate till it be noticed in some other\r\npaper," said the private Secretary. "The \'People\'s Banner\' is known\r\nto be scandalous."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is scandalous. And, moreover, I know the motives and\r\nthe malice of the wretched man who is the editor. But the paper is\r\nread, and the foul charge if repeated will become known, and the\r\nallegation made is true. I did pay the man\'s election expenses;--and,\r\nmoreover, to tell the truth openly as I do not scruple to do to you,\r\nI am not prepared to state publicly the reason why I did so. And\r\nnothing but that reason could justify me."\r\n\r\n"Then I think your Grace should state it."\r\n\r\n"I cannot do so."\r\n\r\n"The Duke of St. Bungay is here. Would it not be well to tell the\r\nwhole affair to him?"\r\n\r\n"I will think of it. I do not know why I should have troubled you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my lord!"\r\n\r\n"Except that there is always some comfort in speaking even of one\'s\r\ntrouble. I will think about it. In the meantime you need perhaps not\r\nmention it again."\r\n\r\n"Who? I? Oh, certainly not."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to others,--but to myself. I will turn it in my mind\r\nand speak of it when I have decided anything." And he did think about\r\nit,--thinking of it so much that he could hardly get the matter out\r\nof his mind day or night. To his wife he did not allude to it at\r\nall. Why trouble her with it? She had caused the evil, and he had\r\ncautioned her as to the future. She could not help him out of the\r\ndifficulty she had created. He continued to turn the matter over\r\nin his thoughts till he so magnified it, and built it up into such\r\nproportions, that he again began to think that he must resign. It\r\nwas, he thought, true that a man should not remain in office as Prime\r\nMinister who in such a matter could not clear his own conduct.\r\n\r\nThen there was a third attack in the "People\'s Banner," and after\r\nthat the matter was noticed in the "Evening Pulpit." This notice\r\nthe Duke of St. Bungay saw and mentioned to Mr. Warburton. "Has the\r\nDuke spoken to you of some allegations made in the press as to the\r\nexpenses of the late election at Silverbridge?" The old Duke was\r\nat this time, and had been for some months, in a state of nervous\r\nanxiety about his friend. He had almost admitted to himself that he\r\nhad been wrong in recommending a politician so weakly organised to\r\ntake the office of Prime Minister. He had expected the man to be\r\nmore manly,--had perhaps expected him to be less conscientiously\r\nscrupulous. But now, as the thing had been done, it must be\r\nmaintained. Who else was there to take the office? Mr. Gresham\r\nwould not. To keep Mr. Daubeny out was the very essence of the Duke\r\nof St. Bungay\'s life,--the turning-point of his political creed,\r\nthe one grand duty the idea of which was always present to him.\r\nAnd he had, moreover, a most true and most affectionate regard\r\nfor the man whom he now supported, appreciating the sweetness\r\nof his character,--believing still in the Minister\'s patriotism,\r\nintelligence, devotion, and honesty; though he was forced to own to\r\nhimself that the strength of a man\'s heart was wanting.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Warburton; "he did mention it."\r\n\r\n"Does it trouble him?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you had better speak to him about it." Both the old Duke and\r\nthe private Secretary were as fearful and nervous about the Prime\r\nMinister as a mother is for a weakly child. They could hardly tell\r\ntheir opinions to each other, but they understood one another, and\r\nbetween them they coddled their Prime Minister. They were specially\r\nnervous as to what might be done by the Prime Minister\'s wife,\r\nnervous as to what was done by every one who came in contact with\r\nhim. It had been once suggested by the private Secretary that Lady\r\nRosina should be sent for, as she had a soothing effect upon the\r\nPrime Minister\'s spirit.\r\n\r\n"Has it irritated him?" asked the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes, it has;--a little, you know. I think your Grace had\r\nbetter speak to him;--and not perhaps mention my name." The Duke of\r\nSt. Bungay nodded his head, and said that he would speak to the great\r\nman and would not mention any one\'s name.\r\n\r\nAnd he did speak. "Has any one said anything to you about it?" asked\r\nthe Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n"I saw it in the \'Evening Pulpit\' myself. I have not heard it\r\nmentioned anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I did pay the man\'s expenses."\r\n\r\n"You did!"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--when the election was over, and, as far as I can remember,\r\nsome time after it was over. He wrote to me saying that he had\r\nincurred such and such expenses, and asking me to repay him. I sent\r\nhim a cheque for the amount."\r\n\r\n"But why?"\r\n\r\n"I was bound in honour to do it."\r\n\r\n"But why?"\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause before this second question was answered.\r\n"The man had been induced to stand by representations made to him\r\nfrom my house. He had been, I fear, promised certain support which\r\ncertainly was not given him when the time came."\r\n\r\n"You had not promised it?"\r\n\r\n"No;--not I."\r\n\r\n"Was it the Duchess?"\r\n\r\n"Upon the whole, my friend, I think I would rather not discuss it\r\nfurther, even with you. It is right that you should know that I did\r\npay the money,--and also why I paid it. It may also be necessary that\r\nwe should consider whether there may be any further probable result\r\nfrom my doing so. But the money has been paid, by me myself,--and was\r\npaid for the reason I have stated."\r\n\r\n"A question might be asked in the House."\r\n\r\n"If so, it must be answered as I have answered you. I certainly shall\r\nnot shirk any responsibility that may be attached to me."\r\n\r\n"You would not like Warburton to write a line to the newspaper?"\r\n\r\n"What;--to the \'People\'s Banner!\'"\r\n\r\n"It began there, did it? No, not to the \'People\'s Banner,\' but to the\r\n\'Evening Pulpit.\' He could say, you know, that the money was paid\r\nby you, and that the payment had been made because your agents had\r\nmisapprehended your instructions."\r\n\r\n"It would not be true," said the Prime Minister, slowly.\r\n\r\n"As far as I can understand that was what occurred," said the other\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n"My instructions were not misapprehended. They were disobeyed. I\r\nthink that perhaps we had better say no more about it."\r\n\r\n"Do not think that I wish to press you," said the old man, tenderly;\r\n"but I fear that something ought to be done;--I mean for your own\r\ncomfort."\r\n\r\n"My comfort!" said the Prime Minister. "That has vanished long\r\nago;--and my peace of mind, and my happiness."\r\n\r\n"There has been nothing done which cannot be explained with perfect\r\ntruth. There has been no impropriety."\r\n\r\n"I do not know."\r\n\r\n"The money was paid simply from an over-nice sense of honour."\r\n\r\n"It cannot be explained. I cannot explain it even to you, and how\r\nthen can I do it to all the gaping fools of the country who are ready\r\nto trample upon a man simply because he is in some way conspicuous\r\namong them?"\r\n\r\nAfter that the old Duke again spoke to Mr. Warburton, but Mr.\r\nWarburton was very loyal to his chief. "Could one do anything by\r\nspeaking to the Duchess?" said the old Duke.\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it was her Grace who did it all."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say. My own impression is that he had better wait till the\r\nHouses meet, and then, if any question is asked, let it be answered.\r\nHe himself would do it in the House of Lords, or Mr. Finn or\r\nBarrington Erle, in our House. It would surely be enough to explain\r\nthat his Grace had been made to believe that the man had received\r\nencouragement at Silverbridge from his own agents, which he himself\r\nhad not intended should be given, and that therefore he had thought\r\nit right to pay the money. After such an explanation what more could\r\nany one say?"\r\n\r\n"You might do it yourself."\r\n\r\n"I never speak."\r\n\r\n"But in such a case as that you might do so; and then there would be\r\nno necessity for him to talk to another person on the matter."\r\n\r\nSo the affair was left for the present, though the allusions to it\r\nin the "People\'s Banner" were still continued. Nor did any other of\r\nthe Prime Minister\'s colleagues dare to speak to him on the subject.\r\nBarrington Erle and Phineas Finn talked of it among themselves, but\r\nthey did not mention it even to the Duchess. She would have gone to\r\nher husband at once; and they were too careful of him to risk such a\r\nproceeding. It certainly was the case that among them they coddled\r\nthe Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nCoddling the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament was to meet on the 12th of February, and it was of course\r\nnecessary that there should be a Cabinet Council before that time.\r\nThe Prime Minister, about the end of the third week in January,\r\nwas prepared to name a day for this, and did so, most unwillingly.\r\nBut he was then ill, and talked both to his friend the old Duke\r\nand his private Secretary of having the meeting held without him.\r\n"Impossible!" said the old Duke.\r\n\r\n"If I could not go it would have to be possible."\r\n\r\n"We could all come here if it were necessary."\r\n\r\n"Bring fourteen or fifteen ministers out of town because a poor\r\ncreature such as I am is ill!" But in truth the Duke of St. Bungay\r\nhardly believed in this illness. The Prime Minister was unhappy\r\nrather than ill.\r\n\r\nBy this time everybody in the House,--and almost everybody in the\r\ncountry who read the newspapers,--had heard of Mr. Lopez and his\r\nelection expenses,--except the Duchess. No one had yet dared to tell\r\nher. She saw the newspapers daily, but probably did not read them\r\nvery attentively. Nevertheless she knew that something was wrong. Mr.\r\nWarburton hovered about the Prime Minister more tenderly than usual;\r\nthe Duke of St. Bungay was more concerned; the world around her was\r\nmore mysterious, and her husband more wretched. "What is it that\'s\r\ngoing on?" she said one day to Phineas Finn.\r\n\r\n"Everything,--in the same dull way as usual."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t tell me, I\'ll never speak to you again. I know there is\r\nsomething wrong."\r\n\r\n"The Duke, I\'m afraid, is not quite well."\r\n\r\n"What makes him ill? I know well when he\'s ill and when he\'s well.\r\nHe\'s troubled by something."\r\n\r\n"I think he is, Duchess. But as he has not spoken to me I am loath to\r\nmake guesses. If there be anything, I can only guess at it."\r\n\r\nThen she questioned Mrs. Finn, and got an answer which, if not\r\nsatisfactory, was at any rate explanatory. "I think he is uneasy\r\nabout that Silverbridge affair."\r\n\r\n"What Silverbridge affair?"\r\n\r\n"You know that he paid the expenses which that man Lopez says that he\r\nincurred."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I know that."\r\n\r\n"And you know that that other man Slide has found it out, and\r\npublished it all in the \'People\'s Banner\'?"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. And a whole army of accusations has been brought\r\nagainst him. I have never liked to tell you, and yet I do not think\r\nthat you should be left in the dark."\r\n\r\n"Everybody deceives me," said the Duchess angrily.\r\n\r\n"Nay;--there has been no deceit."\r\n\r\n"Everybody keeps things from me. I think you will kill me among you.\r\nIt was my doing. Why do they attack him? I will write to the papers.\r\nI encouraged the man after Plantagenet had determined that he should\r\nnot be assisted,--and, because I had done so, he paid the man his\r\nbeggarly money. What is there to hurt him in that? Let me bear it. My\r\nback is broad enough."\r\n\r\n"The Duke is very sensitive."\r\n\r\n"I hate people to be sensitive. It makes them cowards. A man when he\r\nis afraid of being blamed, dares not at last even show himself, and\r\nhas to be wrapped up in lamb\'s wool."\r\n\r\n"Of course men are differently organised."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--but the worst of it is, that when they suffer from this\r\nweakness, which you call sensitiveness, they think that they are made\r\nof finer material than other people. Men shouldn\'t be made of Sevres\r\nchina, but of good stone earthenware. However, I don\'t want to abuse\r\nhim, poor fellow."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you ought."\r\n\r\n"I know what that means. You do want to abuse me. So they\'ve been\r\nbullying him about the money he paid to that man Lopez. How did\r\nanybody know anything about it?"\r\n\r\n"Lopez must have told of it," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"The worst, my dear, of trying to know a great many people is, that\r\nyou are sure to get hold of some that are very bad. Now that man is\r\nvery bad. Yet they say he has married a nice wife."\r\n\r\n"That\'s often the case, Duchess."\r\n\r\n"And the contrary;--isn\'t it, my dear? But I shall have it out with\r\nPlantagenet. If I have to write letters to all the newspapers myself,\r\nI\'ll put it right." She certainly coddled her husband less than the\r\nothers; and, indeed, in her heart of hearts disapproved altogether\r\nof the coddling system. But she was wont at this particular time to\r\nbe somewhat tender to him because she was aware that she herself\r\nhad been imprudent. Since he had discovered her interference at\r\nSilverbridge, and had made her understand its pernicious results,\r\nshe had been,--not, perhaps, shamefaced, for that word describes\r\na condition to which hardly any series of misfortunes could have\r\nreduced the Duchess of Omnium,--but inclined to quiescence by\r\nfeelings of penitence. She was less disposed than heretofore to\r\nattack him with what the world of yesterday calls "chaff," or with\r\nwhat the world of to-day calls "cheek." She would not admit to\r\nherself that she was cowed;--but the greatness of the game and the\r\nhigh interest attached to her husband\'s position did in some degree\r\ndismay her. Nevertheless she executed her purpose of "having it out\r\nwith Plantagenet." "I have just heard," she said, having knocked at\r\nthe door of his own room, and having found him alone,--"I have just\r\nheard, for the first time, that there is a row about the money you\r\npaid to Mr. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"Who told you?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody told me,--in the usual sense of the word. I presumed that\r\nsomething was the matter, and then I got it out from Marie. Why had\r\nyou not told me?"\r\n\r\n"Why should I tell you?"\r\n\r\n"But why not? If anything troubled me I should tell you. That is, if\r\nit troubled me much."\r\n\r\n"You take it for granted that this does trouble me much." He was\r\nsmiling as he said this, but the smile passed very quickly from his\r\nface. "I will not, however, deceive you. It does trouble me."\r\n\r\n"I knew very well that something was wrong."\r\n\r\n"I have not complained."\r\n\r\n"One can see as much as that without words. What is it that you fear?\r\nWhat can the man do to you? What matter is it to you if such a one as\r\nthat pours out his malice on you? Let it run off like the rain from\r\nthe housetops. You are too big even to be stung by such a reptile as\r\nthat." He looked into her face, admiring the energy with which she\r\nspoke to him. "As for answering him," she continued to say, "that\r\nmay or may not be proper. If it should be done, there are people to\r\ndo it. But I am speaking of your own inner self. You have a shield\r\nagainst your equals, and a sword to attack them with if necessary.\r\nHave you no armour of proof against such a creature as that? Have you\r\nnothing inside you to make you feel that he is too contemptible to be\r\nregarded?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Plantagenet!"\r\n\r\n"Cora, there are different natures which have each their own\r\nexcellencies and their own defects. I will not admit that I am a\r\ncoward, believing as I do that I could dare to face necessary danger.\r\nBut I cannot endure to have my character impugned,--even by Mr. Slide\r\nand Mr. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"What matter,--if you are in the right? Why blench if your conscience\r\naccuses you of no fault? I would not blench even if it did. What;--is\r\na man to be put in the front of everything, and then to be judged as\r\nthough he could give all his time to the picking of his steps?"\r\n\r\n"Just so! And he must pick them more warily than another."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe it. You see all this with jaundiced eyes. I read\r\nsomewhere the other day that the great ships have always little worms\r\nattached to them, but that the great ships swim on and know nothing\r\nof the worms."\r\n\r\n"The worms conquer at last."\r\n\r\n"They shouldn\'t conquer me! After all, what is it that they say about\r\nthe money? That you ought not to have paid it?"\r\n\r\n"I begin to think that I was wrong to pay it."\r\n\r\n"You certainly were not wrong. I had led the man on. I had been\r\nmistaken. I had thought that he was a gentleman. Having led him on at\r\nfirst, before you had spoken to me, I did not like to go back from my\r\nword. I did go to the man at Silverbridge who sells the pots, and no\r\ndoubt the man, when thus encouraged, told it all to Lopez. When Lopez\r\nwent to the town he did suppose that he would have what the people\r\ncall the Castle interest."\r\n\r\n"And I had done so much to prevent it!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of going back to that now, unless you want me to put\r\nmy neck down to be trodden on? I am confessing my own sins as fast as\r\nI can."\r\n\r\n"God knows I would not have you trodden on."\r\n\r\n"I am willing,--if it be necessary. Then came the question;--as I had\r\ndone this evil, how was it to be rectified? Any man with a particle\r\nof spirit would have taken his rubs and said nothing about it. But as\r\nthis man asked for the money, it was right that he should have it. If\r\nit is all made public he won\'t get very well out of it."\r\n\r\n"What does that matter to me?"\r\n\r\n"Nor shall I;--only luckily I do not mind it."\r\n\r\n"But I mind it for you."\r\n\r\n"You must throw me to the whale. Let somebody say in so many words\r\nthat the Duchess did so and so. It was very wicked no doubt; but they\r\ncan\'t kill me,--nor yet dismiss me. And I won\'t resign. In point of\r\nfact I shan\'t be a penny the worse for it."\r\n\r\n"But I should resign."\r\n\r\n"If all the Ministers in England were to give up as soon as their\r\nwives do foolish things, that question about the Queen\'s Government\r\nwould become very difficult."\r\n\r\n"They may do foolish things, dear; and yet--"\r\n\r\n"And yet what?"\r\n\r\n"And yet not interfere in politics."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all you know about it, Plantagenet. Doesn\'t everybody know\r\nthat Mrs. Daubeny got Dr. MacFuzlem made a bishop, and that Mrs.\r\nGresham got her husband to make that hazy speech about women\'s\r\nrights, so that nobody should know which way he meant to go? There\r\nare others just as bad as me, only I don\'t think they get blown up so\r\nmuch. You do now as I ask you."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t do it, Cora. Though the stain were but a little spot, and\r\nthe thing to be avoided political destruction, I could not ride out\r\nof the punishment by fixing that stain on my wife. I will not have\r\nyour name mentioned. A man\'s wife should be talked about by no one."\r\n\r\n"That\'s high-foluting, Plantagenet."\r\n\r\n"Glencora, in these matters you must allow me to judge for myself,\r\nand I will judge. I will never say that I didn\'t do it;--but that it\r\nwas my wife who did."\r\n\r\n"Adam said so,--because he chose to tell the truth."\r\n\r\n"And Adam has been despised ever since,--not because he ate the\r\napple, but because he imputed the eating of it to a woman. I will\r\nnot do it. We have had enough of this now." Then she turned to go\r\naway,--but he called her back. "Kiss me, dear," he said. Then she\r\nstooped over him and kissed him. "Do not think I am angry with you\r\nbecause the thing vexes me. I am dreaming always of some day when we\r\nmay go away together with the children, and rest in some pretty spot,\r\nand live as other people live."\r\n\r\n"It would be very stupid," she muttered to herself as she left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHe did go up to town for the Cabinet meeting. Whatever may have been\r\ndone at that august assembly there was certainly no resignation, or\r\nthe world would have heard it. It is probable, too, that nothing was\r\nsaid about these newspaper articles. Things if left to themselves\r\nwill generally die at last. The old Duke and Phineas Finn and\r\nBarrington Erle were all of opinion that the best plan for the\r\npresent was to do nothing. "Has anything been settled?" the Duchess\r\nasked Phineas when he came back.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--the Queen\'s Speech. But there isn\'t very much in it."\r\n\r\n"But about the payment of this money?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t heard a word about it," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"You\'re just as bad as all the rest, Mr. Finn, with your pretended\r\nsecrecy. A girl with her first sweetheart isn\'t half so fussy as a\r\nyoung Cabinet Minister."\r\n\r\n"The Cabinet Ministers get used to it sooner, I think," said Phineas\r\nFinn.\r\n\r\nParliament had already met before Mr. Slide had quite determined in\r\nwhat way he would carry on the war. He could indeed go on writing\r\npernicious articles about the Prime Minister _ad infinitum_,--from\r\nyear\'s end to year\'s end. It was an occupation in which he took\r\ndelight, and for which he imagined himself to be peculiarly well\r\nsuited. But readers will become tired even of abuse if it be not\r\nvaried. And the very continuation of such attacks would seem to imply\r\nthat they were not much heeded. Other papers had indeed taken the\r\nmatter up,--but they had taken it up only to drop it. The subject had\r\nnot been their own. The little discovery had been due not to their\r\nacumen, and did not therefore bear with them the highest interest. It\r\nhad almost seemed as though nothing would come of it;--for Mr. Slide\r\nin his wildest ambition could have hardly imagined the vexation and\r\nhesitation, the nervousness and serious discussions which his words\r\nhad occasioned among the great people at Matching. But certainly the\r\nthing must not be allowed to pass away as a matter of no moment. Mr.\r\nSlide had almost worked his mind up to real horror as he thought of\r\nit. What! A prime minister, a peer, a great duke,--put a man forward\r\nas a candidate for a borough, and, when the man was beaten, pay his\r\nexpenses! Was this to be done,--to be done and found out and then\r\nnothing come of it in these days of purity, when a private member of\r\nParliament, some mere nobody, loses his seat because he has given\r\naway a few bushels of coals or a score or two of rabbits! Mr. Slide\'s\r\nenergetic love of public virtue was scandalised as he thought of the\r\nprobability of such a catastrophe. To his thinking, public virtue\r\nconsisted in carping at men high placed, in abusing ministers and\r\njudges and bishops--and especially in finding out something for\r\nwhich they might be abused. His own public virtue was in this matter\r\nvery great, for it was he who had ferreted out the secret. For his\r\nintelligence and energy in that matter the country owed him much. But\r\nthe country would pay him nothing, would give him none of the credit\r\nhe desired, would rob him of this special opportunity of declaring\r\na dozen times that the "People\'s Banner" was the surest guardian of\r\nthe people\'s liberty,--unless he could succeed in forcing the matter\r\nfurther into public notice. "How terrible is the apathy of the people\r\nat large," said Mr. Slide to himself, "when they cannot be wakened by\r\nsuch a revelation as this!"\r\n\r\nMr. Slide knew very well what ought to be the next step. Proper\r\nnotice should be given and a question should be asked in Parliament.\r\nSome gentleman should declare that he had noticed such and such\r\nstatements in the public press, and that he thought it right to ask\r\nwhether such and such payments had been made by the Prime Minister.\r\nIn his meditations Mr. Slide went so far as to arrange the very words\r\nwhich the indignant gentleman should utter, among which words was a\r\ngraceful allusion to a certain public-spirited newspaper. He did even\r\ngo so far as to arrange a compliment to the editor,--but in doing\r\nso he knew that he was thinking only of that which ought to be, and\r\nnot of that which would be. The time had not come as yet in which\r\nthe editor of a newspaper in this country received a tithe of the\r\nhonour due to him. But the question in any form, with or without a\r\ncompliment to the "People\'s Banner," would be the thing that was now\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nWho was to ask the question? If public spirit were really strong in\r\nthe country there would be no difficulty on that point. The crime\r\ncommitted had been so horrible that all the great politicians of the\r\ncountry ought to compete for the honour of asking it. What greater\r\nservice can be trusted to the hands of a great man than that of\r\nexposing the sins of the rulers of the nation? So thought Mr. Slide.\r\nBut he knew that he was in advance of the people, and that the matter\r\nwould not be seen in the proper light by those who ought so to see\r\nit. There might be a difficulty in getting any peer to ask the\r\nquestion in the House in which the Prime Minister himself sat, and\r\neven in the other House there was now but little of that acrid,\r\nindignant opposition upon which, in Mr. Slide\'s opinion, the safety\r\nof the nation altogether depends.\r\n\r\nWhen the statement was first made in the "People\'s Banner," Lopez had\r\ncome to Mr. Slide at once and had demanded his authority for making\r\nit. Lopez had found the statement to be most injurious to himself. He\r\nhad been paid his election expenses twice over, making a clear profit\r\nof L500 by the transaction; and, though the matter had at one time\r\ntroubled his conscience, he had already taught himself to regard\r\nit as one of those bygones to which a wise man seldom refers. But\r\nnow Mr. Wharton would know that he had been cheated, should this\r\nstatement reach him. "Who gave you authority to publish all this?"\r\nasked Lopez, who at this time had become intimate with Mr. Slide.\r\n\r\n"Is it true, Lopez?" asked the editor.\r\n\r\n"Whatever was done was done in private,--between me and the Duke."\r\n\r\n"Dukes, my dear fellow, can\'t be private, and certainly not when they\r\nare Prime Ministers."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve no right to publish these things about me."\r\n\r\n"Is it true? If it\'s true I have got every right to publish it. If\r\nit\'s not true, I\'ve got the right to ask the question. If you will\r\n\'ave to do with Prime Ministers you can\'t \'ide yourself under a\r\nbushel. Tell me this;--is it true? You might as well go \'and in \'and\r\nwith me in the matter. You can\'t \'urt yourself. And if you oppose\r\nme,--why, I shall oppose you."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t say anything of me."\r\n\r\n"Well;--I don\'t know about that. I can generally \'it pretty \'ard if I\r\nfeel inclined. But I don\'t want to \'it you. As regards you I can tell\r\nthe story one way,--or the other, just as you please." Lopez, seeing\r\nit in the same light, at last agreed that the story should be told in\r\na manner not inimical to himself. The present project of his life was\r\nto leave his troubles in England,--Sexty Parker being the worst of\r\nthem,--and get away to Guatemala. In arranging this the good word of\r\nMr. Slide might not benefit him, but his ill word might injure him.\r\nAnd then, let him do what he would, the matter must be made public.\r\nShould Mr. Wharton hear of it,--as of course he would,--it must\r\nbe brazened out. He could not keep it from Mr. Wharton\'s ears by\r\nquarrelling with Quintus Slide.\r\n\r\n"It was true," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"I knew it before just as well as though I had seen it. I ain\'t\r\noften very wrong in these things. You asked him for the money,--and\r\nthreatened him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about threatening him."\r\n\r\n"\'E wouldn\'t have sent it else."\r\n\r\n"I told him that I had been deceived by his people in the borough,\r\nand that I had been put to expense through the misrepresentations of\r\nthe Duchess. I don\'t think I did ask for the money. But he sent a\r\ncheque, and of course I took it."\r\n\r\n"Of course;--of course. You couldn\'t give me a copy of your letter?"\r\n\r\n"Never kept a copy." He had a copy in his breast coat-pocket at that\r\nmoment, and Slide did not for a moment believe the statement made.\r\nBut in such discussions one man hardly expects truth from another.\r\nMr. Slide certainly never expected truth from any man. "He sent the\r\ncheque almost without a word," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"He did write a note, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Just a few words."\r\n\r\n"Could you let me \'ave that note?"\r\n\r\n"I destroyed it at once." This was also in his breast-pocket at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"Did \'e write it \'imself?"\r\n\r\n"I think it was his private Secretary, Mr. Warburton."\r\n\r\n"You must be sure, you know. Which was it?"\r\n\r\n"It was Mr. Warburton."\r\n\r\n"Was it civil?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was. If it had been uncivil I should have sent it back. I\'m\r\nnot the man to take impudence even from a duke."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll give me those two letters, Lopez, I\'ll stick to you\r\nthrough thick and thin. By heavens I will! Think what the \'People\'s\r\nBanner\' is. You may come to want that kind of thing some of these\r\ndays." Lopez remained silent, looking into the other man\'s eager\r\nface. "I shouldn\'t publish them, you know; but it would be so much to\r\nme to have the evidence in my hands. You might do worse, you know,\r\nthan make a friend of me."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t publish them?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. I shall only refer to them."\r\n\r\nThen Lopez pulled a bundle of papers out of his pocket. "There they\r\nare," he said.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Slide, when he had read them; "it is one of the rummest\r\ntransactions I ever \'eard of. Why did \'e send the money? That\'s what\r\nI want to know. As far as the claim goes, you \'adn\'t a leg to stand\r\non."\r\n\r\n"Not legally."\r\n\r\n"You \'adn\'t a leg to stand on any way. But that doesn\'t much matter.\r\nHe sent the money, and the sending of the money was corrupt. Who\r\nshall I get to ask the question? I suppose young Fletcher wouldn\'t do\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re birds of a feather," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"Birds of a feather do fall out sometimes. Or Sir Orlando Drought?\r\nI wonder whether Sir Orlando would do it. If any man ever \'ated\r\nanother, Sir Orlando Drought must \'ate the Duke of Omnium."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he\'d let himself down to that kind of thing."\r\n\r\n"Let \'imself down! I don\'t see any letting down in it. But those men\r\nwho have been in cabinets do stick to one another even when they are\r\nenemies. They think themselves so mighty that they oughtn\'t to be\r\n\'andled like other men. But I\'ll let \'em know that I\'ll \'andle \'em. A\r\nCabinet Minister or a cowboy is the same to Quintus Slide when he has\r\ngot his pen in \'is \'and."\r\n\r\nOn the next morning there came out another article in the "People\'s\r\nBanner," in which the writer declared that he had in his own\r\npossession the damnatory correspondence between the Prime Minister\r\nand the late candidate at Silverbridge. "The Prime Minister may\r\ndeny the fact," said the article. "We do not think it probable, but\r\nit is possible. We wish to be fair and above-board in everything.\r\nAnd therefore we at once inform the noble Duke that the entire\r\ncorrespondence is in our hands." In saying this Mr. Quintus Slide\r\nthought that he had quite kept the promise which he made when he said\r\nthat he would only refer to the letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\n"I Can Sleep Here To-night, I Suppose?"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat scheme of going to Guatemala had been in the first instance\r\npropounded by Lopez with the object of frightening Mr. Wharton\r\ninto terms. There had, indeed, been some previous thoughts on the\r\nsubject,--some plan projected before his marriage; but it had been\r\nresuscitated mainly with the hope that it might be efficacious to\r\nextract money. When by degrees the son-in-law began to feel that even\r\nthis would not be operative on his father-in-law\'s purse,--when under\r\nthis threat neither Wharton nor Emily gave way,--and when, with the\r\nview of strengthening his threat, he renewed his inquiries as to\r\nGuatemala and found that there might still be an opening for him in\r\nthat direction,--the threat took the shape of a true purpose, and he\r\nbegan to think that he would in real earnest try his fortunes in a\r\nnew world. From day to day things did not go well with him, and from\r\nday to day Sexty Parker became more unendurable. It was impossible\r\nfor him to keep from his partner this plan of emigration,--but he\r\nendeavoured to make Parker believe that the thing, if done at all,\r\nwas not to be done till all his affairs were settled,--or in other\r\nwords all his embarrassments cleared by downright money payments, and\r\nthat Mr. Wharton was to make these payments on the condition that he\r\nthus expatriated himself. But Mr. Wharton had made no such promise.\r\nThough the threatened day came nearer and nearer he could not bring\r\nhimself to purchase a short respite for his daughter by paying money\r\nto a scoundrel,--which payment he felt sure would be of no permanent\r\nservice. During all this time Mr. Wharton was very wretched. If he\r\ncould have freed his daughter from her marriage by half his fortune\r\nhe would have done it without a second thought. If he could have\r\nassuredly purchased the permanent absence of her husband, he would\r\nhave done it at a large price. But let him pay what he would,\r\nhe could see his way to no security. From day to day he became\r\nmore strongly convinced of the rascality of this man who was his\r\nson-in-law, and who was still an inmate in his own house. Of course\r\nhe had accusations enough to make within his own breast against his\r\ndaughter, who, when the choice was open to her, would not take the\r\naltogether fitting husband provided for her, but had declared herself\r\nto be broken-hearted for ever unless she were allowed to throw\r\nherself away upon this wretched creature. But he blamed himself\r\nalmost as much as he did her. Why had he allowed himself to be so\r\nenervated by her prayers at last as to surrender everything,--as he\r\nhad done? How could he presume to think that he should be allowed to\r\nescape, when he had done so little to prevent this misery?\r\n\r\nHe spoke to Emily about it,--not often indeed, but with great\r\nearnestness. "I have done it myself," she said, "and I will bear it."\r\n\r\n"Tell him you cannot go till you know to what home you are going."\r\n\r\n"That is for him to consider. I have begged him to let me remain, and\r\nI can say no more. If he chooses to take me, I shall go."\r\n\r\nThen he spoke to her about money. "Of course I have money," he said.\r\n"Of course I have enough both for you and Everett. If I could do any\r\ngood by giving it to him, he should have it."\r\n\r\n"Papa," she answered, "I will never again ask you to give him a\r\nsingle penny. That must be altogether between you and him. He is what\r\nthey call a speculator. Money is not safe with him."\r\n\r\n"I shall have to send it you when you are in want."\r\n\r\n"When I am--dead there will be no more to be sent. Do not look like\r\nthat, papa. I know what I have done, and I must bear it. I have\r\nthrown away my life. It is just that. If baby had lived it would\r\nhave been different." This was about the end of January, and then Mr.\r\nWharton heard of the great attack made by Mr. Quintus Slide against\r\nthe Prime Minister, and heard, of course, of the payment alleged to\r\nhave been made to Ferdinand Lopez by the Duke on the score of the\r\nelection at Silverbridge. Some persons spoke to him on the subject.\r\nOne or two friends at the club asked him what he supposed to be the\r\ntruth in the matter, and Mrs. Roby inquired of him on the subject. "I\r\nhave asked Lopez," she said, "and I am sure from his manner that he\r\ndid get the money."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about it," said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"If he did get it I think he was very clever." It was well known at\r\nthis time to Mrs. Roby that the Lopez marriage had been a failure,\r\nthat Lopez was not a rich man, and that Emily, as well as her father,\r\nwas discontented and unhappy. She had latterly heard of the Guatemala\r\nscheme, and had of course expressed her horror. But she sympathised\r\nwith Lopez rather than with his wife, thinking that if Mr. Wharton\r\nwould only open his pockets wide enough things might still be right.\r\n"It was all the Duchess\'s fault, you know," she said to the old man.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about it, and when I want to know I certainly shall\r\nnot come to you. The misery he has brought upon me is so great that\r\nit makes me wish that I had never seen any one who knew him."\r\n\r\n"It was Everett who introduced him to your house."\r\n\r\n"It was you who introduced him to Everett."\r\n\r\n"There you are wrong,--as you so often are, Mr. Wharton. Everett met\r\nhim first at the club."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of arguing about it? It was at your house that Emily\r\nmet him. It was you that did it. I wonder you can have the face to\r\nmention his name to me."\r\n\r\n"And the man living all the time in your own house!"\r\n\r\nUp to this time Mr. Wharton had not mentioned to a single person\r\nthe fact that he had paid his son-in-law\'s election expenses at\r\nSilverbridge. He had given him the cheque without much consideration,\r\nwith the feeling that by doing so he would in some degree benefit\r\nhis daughter; and had since regretted the act, finding that no such\r\npayment from him could be of any service to Emily. But the thing\r\nhad been done,--and there had been, so far, an end of it. In no\r\nsubsequent discussion would Mr. Wharton have alluded to it, had not\r\ncircumstances now as it were driven it back upon his mind. And since\r\nthe day on which he had paid that money he had been, as he declared\r\nto himself, swindled over and over again by his son-in-law. There was\r\nthe dinner in Manchester Square, and after that the brougham, and\r\nthe rent, and a score of bills, some of which he had paid and some\r\ndeclined to pay! And yet he had said but little to the man himself of\r\nall these injuries. Of what use was it to say anything? Lopez would\r\nsimply reply that he had asked him to pay nothing. "What is it all,"\r\nLopez had once said, "to the fortune I had a right to expect with\r\nyour daughter?" "You had no right to expect a shilling," Wharton had\r\nsaid. Then Lopez had shrugged his shoulders, and there had been an\r\nend of it.\r\n\r\nBut now, if this rumour were true, there had been positive\r\ndishonesty. From whichever source the man might have got the money\r\nfirst, if the money had been twice got, the second payment had been\r\nfraudulently obtained. Surely if the accusation had been untrue Lopez\r\nwould have come to him and declared it to be false, knowing what must\r\notherwise be his thoughts. Lately, in the daily worry of his life,\r\nhe had avoided all conversation with the man. He would not allow his\r\nmind to contemplate clearly what was coming. He entertained some\r\nirrational, undefined hope that something would at last save his\r\ndaughter from the threatened banishment. It might be, if he held his\r\nown hand tight enough, that there would not be money enough even to\r\npay for her passage out. As for her outfit, Lopez would of course\r\norder what he wanted and have the bills sent to Manchester Square.\r\nWhether or not this was being done neither he nor Emily knew. And\r\nthus matters went on without much speech between the two men. But now\r\nthe old barrister thought that he was bound to speak. He therefore\r\nwaited on a certain morning till Lopez had come down, having\r\npreviously desired his daughter to leave the room. "Lopez," he asked,\r\n"what is this that the newspapers are saying about your expenses at\r\nSilverbridge?"\r\n\r\nLopez had expected the attack and had endeavoured to prepare himself\r\nfor it. "I should have thought, sir, that you would not have paid\r\nmuch attention to such statements in a newspaper."\r\n\r\n"When they concern myself, I do. I paid your electioneering\r\nexpenses."\r\n\r\n"You certainly subscribed L500 towards them, Mr. Wharton."\r\n\r\n"I subscribed nothing, sir. There was no question of a\r\nsubscription,--by which you intend to imply contribution from various\r\nsources; You told me that the contest cost you L500 and that sum I\r\nhanded to you, with the full understanding on your part, as well as\r\non mine, that I was paying for the whole. Was that so?"\r\n\r\n"Have it your own way, sir."\r\n\r\n"If you are not more precise, I shall think that you have defrauded\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Defrauded you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir;--defrauded me, or the Duke of Omnium. The money is gone,\r\nand it matters little which. But if that be so I shall know that\r\neither from him or from me you have raised money under false\r\npretences."\r\n\r\n"Of course, Mr. Wharton, from you I must bear whatever you may choose\r\nto say."\r\n\r\n"Is it true that you have applied to the Duke of Omnium for money on\r\naccount of your expenses at Silverbridge, and is it true that he has\r\npaid you money on that score?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Wharton, as I said just now, I am bound to hear and to bear from\r\nyou anything that you may choose to say. Your connection with my wife\r\nand your age alike restrain my resentment. But I am not bound to\r\nanswer your questions when they are accompanied by such language as\r\nyou have chosen to use, and I refuse to answer any further questions\r\non this subject."\r\n\r\n"Of course I know that you have taken the money from the Duke."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you ask me?"\r\n\r\n"And of course I know that you are as well aware as I am of the\r\nnature of the transaction. That you can brazen it out without a blush\r\nonly proves to me that you have got beyond the reach of shame!"\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir."\r\n\r\n"And you have no further explanation to make?"\r\n\r\n"What do you expect me to say? Without knowing any of the facts of\r\nthe case,--except the one, that you contributed L500 to my election\r\nexpenses,--you take upon yourself to tell me that I am a shameless,\r\nfraudulent swindler. And then you ask for a further explanation! In\r\nsuch a position is it likely that I shall explain anything;--that I\r\ncan be in a humour to be explanatory? Just turn it all over in your\r\nmind, and ask yourself the question."\r\n\r\n"I have turned it over in my own mind, and I have asked myself the\r\nquestion, and I do not think it probable that you should wish to\r\nexplain anything. I shall take steps to let the Duke know that I as\r\nyour father-in-law had paid the full sum which you had stated that\r\nyou had spent at Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"Much the Duke will care about that."\r\n\r\n"And after what has passed I am obliged to say that the sooner you\r\nleave this house the better I shall be pleased."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir. Of course I shall take my wife with me."\r\n\r\n"That must be as she pleases."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Wharton. That must be as I please. She belongs to me,--not\r\nto you or to herself. Under your influence she has forgotten much of\r\nwhat belongs to the duty of a wife, but I do not think that she will\r\nso far have forgotten herself as to give me more trouble than to bid\r\nher come with me when I desire it."\r\n\r\n"Let that be as it may, I must request that you, sir, will absent\r\nyourself. I will not entertain as my guest a man who has acted as you\r\nhave done in this matter,--even though he be my son-in-law."\r\n\r\n"I can sleep here to-night, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Or to-morrow if it suits you. As for Emily, she can remain here, if\r\nyou will allow her to do so."\r\n\r\n"That will not suit me," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"In that case, as far as I am concerned, I shall do whatever she may\r\nask me to do. Good morning."\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton left the room, but did not leave the house. Before he did\r\nso he would see his daughter; and, thinking it probable that Lopez\r\nwould also choose to see his wife, he prepared to wait in his own\r\nroom. But, in about ten minutes, Lopez started from the hall door\r\nin a cab, and did so without going upstairs. Mr. Wharton had reason\r\nto believe that his son-in-law was almost destitute of money for\r\nimmediate purposes. Whatever he might have would at any rate be\r\nserviceable to him before he started. Any home for Emily must be\r\nexpensive; and no home in their present circumstances could be so\r\nreputable for her as one under her father\'s roof. He therefore almost\r\nhoped that she might still be left with him till that horrid day\r\nshould come,--if it ever did come,--in which she would be taken away\r\nfrom him for ever. "Of course, papa, I shall go if he bids me," she\r\nsaid, when he told her all that he thought right to tell her of that\r\nmorning\'s interview.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know how to advise you," said the father, meaning in truth\r\nto bring himself round to the giving of some advice adverse to her\r\nhusband\'s will.\r\n\r\n"I want no advice, papa."\r\n\r\n"Want no advice! I never knew a woman who wanted it more."\r\n\r\n"No, papa. I am bound to do as he tells me. I know what I have done.\r\nWhen some poor wretch has got himself into perpetual prison by his\r\nmisdeeds, no advice can serve him then. So it is with me."\r\n\r\n"You can at any rate escape from your prison."\r\n\r\n"No;--no. I have a feeling of pride which tells me that as I chose\r\nto become the wife of my husband,--as I insisted on it in opposition\r\nto all my friends,--as I would judge for myself,--I am bound to put\r\nup with my choice. If this had come upon me through the authority of\r\nothers, if I had been constrained to marry him, I think I could have\r\nreconciled myself to deserting him. But I did it myself, and I will\r\nabide by it. When he bids me go, I shall go." Poor Mr. Wharton went\r\nto his chambers, and sat there the whole day without taking a book\r\nor a paper into his hands. Could there be no rescue, no protection,\r\nno relief! He turned over in his head various plans, but in a vague\r\nand useless manner. What if the Duke were to prosecute Lopez for the\r\nfraud! What if he could induce Lopez to abandon his wife,--pledging\r\nhimself by some deed not to return to her,--for, say, twenty or even\r\nthirty thousand pounds! What if he himself were to carry his daughter\r\naway to the continent, half forcing and half persuading her to make\r\nthe journey! Surely there might be some means found by which the\r\nman might be frightened into compliance. But there he sat,--and did\r\nnothing. And in the evening he ate a solitary mutton chop at The\r\nJolly Blackbird, because he could not bear to face even his club, and\r\nthen returned to his chambers,--to the great disgust of the old woman\r\nwho had them in charge at nights. And at about midnight he crept away\r\nto his own house, a wretched old man.\r\n\r\nLopez when he left Manchester Square did not go in search of a new\r\nhome for himself and his wife, nor during the whole of the day did\r\nhe trouble himself on that subject. He spent most of the day at the\r\nrooms in Coleman Street of the San Juan Mining Association, of which\r\nMr. Mills Happerton had once been Chairman. There was now another\r\nChairman and other Directors; but Mr. Mills Happerton\'s influence had\r\nso far remained with the Company as to enable Lopez to become well\r\nknown in the Company\'s offices, and acknowledged as a claimant for\r\nthe office of resident Manager at San Juan in Guatemala. Now the\r\npresent project was this,--that Lopez was to start on behalf of the\r\nCompany early in May, that the Company was to pay his own personal\r\nexpenses out to Guatemala, and that they should allow him while there\r\na salary of L1000 a year for managing the affairs of the mine. As far\r\nas this offer went, the thing was true enough. It was true that Lopez\r\nhad absolutely secured the place. But he had done so subject to the\r\nburden of one very serious stipulation. He was to become proprietor\r\nof 50 shares in the mine, and to pay up L100 each on those shares. It\r\nwas considered that the man who was to get L1000 a year in Guatemala\r\nfor managing the affair, should at any rate assist the affair, and\r\nshow his confidence in the affair to an extent as great as that. Of\r\ncourse the holder of these 50 shares would be as fully entitled as\r\nany other shareholder to that 20 per cent. which those who promoted\r\nthe mine promised as the immediate result of the speculation.\r\n\r\nAt first Lopez had hoped that he might be enabled to defer the actual\r\npayment of the L5000 till after he had sailed. When once out in\r\nGuatemala as manager, as manager he would doubtless remain. But by\r\ndegrees he found that the payment must actually be made in advance.\r\nNow there was nobody to whom he could apply but Mr. Wharton. He was,\r\nindeed, forced to declare at the office that the money was to come\r\nfrom Mr. Wharton, and had given some excellent but fictitious reason\r\nwhy Mr. Wharton would not pay the money till February.\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of all that had come and gone he still did hope that if\r\nthe need to go were actually there he might even yet get the money\r\nfrom Mr. Wharton. Surely Mr. Wharton would sooner pay such a sum than\r\nbe troubled at home with such a son-in-law. Should the worst come to\r\nthe worst, of course he could raise the money by consenting to leave\r\nhis wife at home. But this was not part of his plan, if he could\r\navoid it. L5000 would be a very low price at which to sell his wife,\r\nand all that he might get from his connection with her. As long as\r\nhe kept her with him he was in possession at any rate of all that Mr.\r\nWharton would do for her. He had not therefore as yet made his final\r\napplication to his father-in-law for the money, having found it\r\npossible to postpone the payment till the middle of February. His\r\nquarrel with Mr. Wharton this morning he regarded as having little or\r\nno effect upon his circumstances. Mr. Wharton would not give him the\r\nmoney because he loved him, nor yet from personal respect, nor from\r\nany sense of duty as to what he might owe to a son-in-law. It would\r\nbe simply given as the price by which his absence might be purchased,\r\nand his absence would not be the less desirable because of this\r\nmorning\'s quarrel.\r\n\r\nBut, even yet, he was not quite resolved as to going to Guatemala.\r\nSexty Parker had been sucked nearly dry, and was in truth at this\r\nmoment so violent with indignation and fear and remorse that Lopez\r\ndid not dare to show himself in Little Tankard Yard; but still there\r\nwere, even yet, certain hopes in that direction from which great\r\nresults might come. If a certain new spirit which had just been\r\nconcocted from the bark of trees in Central Africa, and which was\r\ncalled Bios, could only be made to go up in the market, everything\r\nmight be satisfactorily arranged. The hoardings of London were\r\nalready telling the public that if it wished to get drunk without any\r\nof the usual troubles of intoxication it must drink Bios. The public\r\nno doubt does read the literature of the hoardings, but then it reads\r\nso slowly! This Bios had hardly been twelve months on the boards as\r\nyet! But they were now increasing the size of the letters in the\r\nadvertisements and the jocundity of the pictures,--and the thing\r\nmight be done. There was, too, another hope,--another hope of instant\r\nmoneys by which Guatemala might be staved off, as to which further\r\nexplanation shall be given in a further chapter.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I shall find Dixon a decent sort of a fellow?" said Lopez\r\nto the Secretary of the Association in Coleman Street.\r\n\r\n"Rough, you know."\r\n\r\n"But honest?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--he\'s all that."\r\n\r\n"If he\'s honest, and what I call loyal, I don\'t care a straw for\r\nanything else. One doesn\'t expect West-end manners in Guatemala. But\r\nI shall have a deal to do with him,--and I hate a fellow that you\r\ncan\'t depend on."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Happerton used to think a great deal of Dixon."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," said Lopez. Mr. Dixon was the underground manager\r\nout at the San Juan mine, and was perhaps as anxious for a loyal and\r\nhonest colleague as was Mr. Lopez. If so, Mr. Dixon was very much in\r\nthe way to be disappointed.\r\n\r\nLopez stayed at the office all the day studying the affairs of the\r\nSan Juan mine, and then went to the Progress for his dinner. Hitherto\r\nhe had taken no steps whatever as to getting lodgings for himself or\r\nfor his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\nMr. Hartlepod\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the time came at which Lopez should have left Manchester Square\r\nhe was still there. Mr. Wharton, in discussing the matter with his\r\ndaughter,--when wishing to persuade her that she might remain in his\r\nhouse even in opposition to her husband,--had not told her that he\r\nhad actually desired Lopez to leave it. He had then felt sure that\r\nthe man would go and would take his wife with him, but he did not\r\neven yet know the obduracy and the cleverness and the impregnability\r\nof his son-in-law. When the time came, when he saw his daughter in\r\nthe morning after the notice had been given, he could not bring\r\nhimself even yet to say to her that he had issued an order for\r\nhis banishment. Days went by and Lopez was still there, and the\r\nold barrister said no further word on the subject. The two men\r\nnever met;--or met simply in the hall or passages. Wharton himself\r\nstudiously avoided such meetings, thus denying himself the commonest\r\nuses of his own house. At last Emily told him that her husband had\r\nfixed the day for her departure. The next Indian mail-packet by which\r\nthey would leave England would start from Southampton on the 2nd of\r\nApril, and she was to be ready to go on that day. "How is it to be\r\ntill then?" the father asked in a low, uncertain voice.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I may remain with you."\r\n\r\n"And your husband?"\r\n\r\n"He will be here too,--I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Such a misery,--such a destruction of everything no man ever\r\nheard of before!" said Mr. Wharton. To this she made no reply,\r\nbut continued working at some necessary preparation for her final\r\ndeparture. "Emily," he said, "I will make any sacrifice to prevent\r\nit. What can be done? Short of injuring Everett\'s interests I will do\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"I do not know," she said.\r\n\r\n"You must understand something of his affairs."\r\n\r\n"Nothing whatever. He has told me nothing of them. In earlier\r\ndays,--soon after our marriage,--he bade me get money from you."\r\n\r\n"When you wrote to me for money from Italy?"\r\n\r\n"And after that. I have refused to do anything;--to say a word. I\r\ntold him that it must be between you and him. What else could I say?\r\nAnd now he tells me nothing."\r\n\r\n"I cannot think that he should want you to go with him." Then there\r\nwas again a pause. "Is it because he loves you?"\r\n\r\n"Not that, papa."\r\n\r\n"Why then should he burden himself with a companion? His money,\r\nwhatever he has, would go further without such impediment."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he thinks, papa, that while I am with him he has a hold upon\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"He shall have a stronger hold by leaving you. What is he to gain? If\r\nI could only know his price."\r\n\r\n"Ask him, papa."\r\n\r\n"I do not even know how I am to speak to him again."\r\n\r\nThen again there was a pause. "Papa," she said after a while, "I have\r\ndone it myself. Let me go. You will still have Everett. And it may be\r\nthat after a time I shall come back to you. He will not kill me, and\r\nit may be that I shall not die."\r\n\r\n"By God!" said Mr. Wharton, rising from his chair suddenly, "if there\r\nwere money to be made by it, I believe that he would murder you\r\nwithout scruple." Thus it was that within eighteen months of her\r\nmarriage the father spoke to his daughter of her husband.\r\n\r\n"What am I to take with me?" she said to her husband a few days\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n"You had better ask your father."\r\n\r\n"Why should I ask him, Ferdinand? How should he know?"\r\n\r\n"And how should I?"\r\n\r\n"I should have thought that you would interest yourself about it."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I have enough to interest me just at present, without\r\nthinking of your finery. I suppose you mean what clothes you should\r\nhave?"\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of myself only."\r\n\r\n"You need think of nothing else. Ask him what he pleases to allow you\r\nto spend, and then I will tell you what to get."\r\n\r\n"I will never ask him for anything, Ferdinand."\r\n\r\n"Then you may go without anything. You might as well do it at once,\r\nfor you will have to do it sooner or later. Or, if you please, go\r\nto his tradesmen and say nothing to him about it. They will give\r\nyou credit. You see how it is, my dear. He has cheated me in a most\r\nrascally manner. He has allowed me to marry his daughter, and because\r\nI did not make a bargain with him as another man would have done, he\r\ndenies me the fortune I had a right to expect with you. You know that\r\nthe Israelites despoiled the Egyptians, and it was taken as a merit\r\non their part. Your father is an Egyptian to me, and I will despoil\r\nhim. You can tell him that I say so if you please."\r\n\r\nAnd so the days went on till the first week of February had passed,\r\nand Parliament had met. Both Lopez and his wife were still living in\r\nManchester Square. Not another word had been said as to that notice\r\nto quit, nor an allusion made to it. It was supposed to be a settled\r\nthing that Lopez was to start with his wife for Guatemala in the\r\nfirst week in April. Mr. Wharton had himself felt that difficulty\r\nas to his daughter\'s outfit, and had told her that she might get\r\nwhatever it pleased her on his credit. "For yourself, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Papa, I will get nothing till he bids me."\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t go across the world without anything. What are you to\r\ndo in such a place as that unless you have the things you want?"\r\n\r\n"What do poor people do who have to go? What should I do if you had\r\ncast me off because of my disobedience?"\r\n\r\n"But I have not cast you off."\r\n\r\n"Tell him that you will give him so much, and then, if he bids me, I\r\nwill spend it."\r\n\r\n"Let it be so. I will tell him."\r\n\r\nUpon that Mr. Wharton did speak to his son-in-law;--coming upon him\r\nsuddenly one morning in the dining-room. "Emily will want an outfit\r\nif she is to go to this place."\r\n\r\n"Like other people she wants many things that she cannot get."\r\n\r\n"I will tell my tradesmen to furnish her with what she wants, up\r\nto,--well,--suppose I say L200. I have spoken to her and she wants\r\nyour sanction."\r\n\r\n"My sanction for spending your money? She can have that very\r\nquickly."\r\n\r\n"You can tell her so;--or I will do so."\r\n\r\nUpon that Mr. Wharton was going, but Lopez stopped him. It was now\r\nessential that the money for the shares in the San Juan mine should\r\nbe paid up, and his father-in-law\'s pocket was still the source from\r\nwhich the enterprising son-in-law hoped to procure it. Lopez had\r\nfully made up his mind to demand it, and thought that the time had\r\nnow come. And he was resolved that he would not ask it as a favour on\r\nbended knee. He was beginning to feel his own power, and trusted that\r\nhe might prevail by other means than begging. "Mr. Wharton," he said,\r\n"you and I have not been very good friends lately."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed."\r\n\r\n"There was a time,--a very short time,--during which I thought that\r\nwe might hit it off together, and I did my best. You do not, I fancy,\r\nlike men of my class."\r\n\r\n"Well;--well! You had better go on if there be anything to say."\r\n\r\n"I have much to say, and I will go on. You are a rich man, and I am\r\nyour son-in-law." Mr. Wharton put his left hand up to his forehead,\r\nbrushing the few hairs back from his head, but he said nothing. "Had\r\nI received from you during the last most vital year that assistance\r\nwhich I think I had a right to expect, I also might have been a rich\r\nman now. It is no good going back to that." Then he paused, but still\r\nMr. Wharton said nothing. "Now you know what has come to me and to\r\nyour daughter. We are to be expatriated."\r\n\r\n"Is that my fault?"\r\n\r\n"I think it is, but I mean to say nothing further of that. This\r\nCompany which is sending me out, and which will probably be the most\r\nthriving thing of the kind which has come up within these twenty\r\nyears, is to pay me a salary of L1000 a year as resident manager at\r\nSan Juan."\r\n\r\n"So I understand."\r\n\r\n"The salary alone would be a beggarly thing. Guatemala, I take it, is\r\nnot the cheapest country in the world in which a man can live. But I\r\nam to go out as the owner of fifty shares on which L100 each must be\r\npaid up, and I am entitled to draw another L1000 a year as dividend\r\non the profit of those shares."\r\n\r\n"That will be twenty per cent."\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"And will double your salary."\r\n\r\n"Just so. But there is one little ceremony to be perfected before I\r\ncan be allowed to enter upon so halcyon a state of existence. The\r\nL100 a share must be paid up." Mr. Wharton simply stared at him. "I\r\nmust have the L5000 to invest in the undertaking before I can start."\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"Now I have not got L5000 myself, nor any part of it. You do not\r\nwish, I suppose, to see either me or your daughter starve. And as\r\nfor me, I hardly flatter myself when I say that you are very anxious\r\nto be rid of me. L5000 is not very much for me to ask of you, as I\r\nregard it."\r\n\r\n"Such consummate impudence I never met in my life before!"\r\n\r\n"Nor perhaps so much unprevaricating downright truth. At any rate\r\nsuch is the condition of my affairs. If I am to go the money must be\r\npaid this week. I have, perhaps foolishly, put off mentioning the\r\nmatter till I was sure that I could not raise the sum elsewhere.\r\nThough I feel my claim on you to be good, Mr. Wharton, it is not\r\npleasant to me to make it."\r\n\r\n"You are asking me for L5000 down!"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I am."\r\n\r\n"What security am I to have?"\r\n\r\n"Security?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--that if I pay it I shall not be troubled again by the meanest\r\nscoundrel that it has ever been my misfortune to meet. How am I to\r\nknow that you will not come back to-morrow? How am I to know that you\r\nwill go at all? Do you think it probable that I will give you L5000\r\non your own simple word?"\r\n\r\n"Then the scoundrel will stay in England,--and will generally find it\r\nconvenient to live in Manchester Square."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be d----d if he does. Look here, sir. Between you and me\r\nthere can be a bargain, and nothing but a bargain. I will pay the\r\nL5000,--on certain conditions."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t doubt at all that you would pay it."\r\n\r\n"I will go with you to the office of this Company, and will pay for\r\nthe shares if I can receive assurance there that the matter is as you\r\nsay, and that the shares will not be placed in your power before you\r\nhave reached Guatemala."\r\n\r\n"You can come to-day, sir, and receive all that assurance."\r\n\r\n"And I must have a written undertaking from you,--a document which my\r\ndaughter can show if it be necessary,--that you will never claim her\r\nsociety again or trouble her with any application."\r\n\r\n"You mistake me, Mr. Wharton. My wife goes with me to Guatemala."\r\n\r\n"Then I will not pay one penny. Why should I? What is your presence\r\nor absence to me except as it concerns her? Do you think that I care\r\nfor your threats of remaining here? The police will set that right."\r\n\r\n"Wherever I go, my wife goes."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see to that too. If you want the money, you must leave her.\r\nGood morning."\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton as he went to his chambers thought the matter over. He\r\nwas certainly willing to risk the L5000 demanded if he could rid\r\nhimself and his daughter of this terrible incubus, even if it were\r\nonly for a time. If Lopez would but once go to Guatemala, leaving his\r\nwife behind him, it would be comparatively easy to keep them apart\r\nshould he ever return. The difficulty now was not in him but in her.\r\nThe man\'s conduct had been so outrageous, so bare-faced, so cruel,\r\nthat the lawyer did not doubt but that he could turn the husband\r\nout of his house, and keep the wife, even now, were it not that she\r\nwas determined to obey the man whom she, in opposition to all her\r\nfriends, had taken as her master. "I have done it myself, and I will\r\nbear it," was all the answer she would make when her father strove\r\nto persuade her to separate herself from her husband. "You have got\r\nEverett," she would say. "When a girl is married she is divided from\r\nher family;--and I am divided." But she would willingly stay if Lopez\r\nwould bid her stay. It now seemed that he could not go without the\r\nL5000; and, when the pressure came upon him, surely he would go and\r\nleave his wife.\r\n\r\nIn the course of that day Mr. Wharton went to the offices of the\r\nSan Juan mine and asked to see the Director. He was shown up into\r\na half-furnished room, two stories high, in Coleman Street, where\r\nhe found two clerks sitting upon stools;--and when he asked for the\r\nDirector was shown into the back room in which sat the Secretary. The\r\nSecretary was a dark, plump little man with a greasy face, who had\r\nthe gift of assuming an air of great importance as he twisted his\r\nchair round to face visitors who came to inquire about the San Juan\r\nMining Company. His name was Hartlepod; and if the San Juan mine\r\n"turned out trumps," as he intended that it should, Mr. Hartlepod\r\nmeant to be a great man in the City. To Mr. Hartlepod Mr. Wharton,\r\nwith considerable embarrassment, explained as much of the joint\r\nhistory of himself and Lopez as he found to be absolutely necessary.\r\n"He has only left the office about half-an-hour," said Mr. Hartlepod.\r\n\r\n"Of course you understand that he is my son-in-law."\r\n\r\n"He has mentioned your name to us, Mr. Wharton, before now."\r\n\r\n"And he is going out to Guatemala?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--he\'s going out. Has he not told you as much himself?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, sir. And he has told me that he is desirous of buying\r\ncertain shares in the Company before he starts."\r\n\r\n"Probably, Mr. Wharton."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I believe he cannot go unless he buys them."\r\n\r\n"That may be so, Mr. Wharton. No doubt he has told you all that\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, Mr. Hartlepod, I am willing, under certain\r\nstipulations, to advance him the money." Mr. Hartlepod bowed. "I\r\nneed not trouble you with private affairs between myself and my\r\nson-in-law." Again the Secretary bowed. "But it seems to be for his\r\ninterest that he should go."\r\n\r\n"A very great opening indeed, Mr. Wharton. I don\'t see how a man is\r\nto have a better opening. A fine salary! His expenses out paid! One\r\nof the very best things that has come up for many years! And as for\r\nthe capital he is to embark in the affair, he is as safe to get 20\r\nper cent. on it,--as safe,--as safe as the Bank of England."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll have the shares?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--the scrip will be handed to him at once."\r\n\r\n"And,--and--"\r\n\r\n"If you mean about the mine, Mr. Wharton, you may take my word that\r\nit\'s all real. It\'s not one of those sham things that melt away like\r\nsnow and leave the shareholders nowhere. There\'s the prospectus, Mr.\r\nWharton. Perhaps you have not seen that before. Take it away and\r\ncast your eye over it at your leisure." Mr. Wharton put the somewhat\r\nlengthy pamphlet into his pocket. "Look at the list of Directors.\r\nWe\'ve three members of Parliament, a baronet, and one or two City\r\nnames that are as good--as good as the Bank of England. If that\r\nprospectus won\'t make a man confident I don\'t know what will. Why,\r\nMr. Wharton, you don\'t think that your son-in-law would get those\r\nfifty shares at par unless he was going out as our general local\r\nmanager. The shares ain\'t to be had. It\'s a large concern as far as\r\ncapital goes. You\'ll see if you look. About a quarter of a million\r\npaid up. But it\'s all in a box as one may say. It\'s among ourselves.\r\nThe shares ain\'t in the market. Of course it\'s not for me to say what\r\nshould be done between you and your son-in-law. Lopez is a friend\r\nof mine, and a man I esteem, and all that. Nevertheless I shouldn\'t\r\nthink of advising you to do this or that,--or not to do it. But when\r\nyou talk of safety, Mr. Wharton,--why, Mr. Wharton, I don\'t scruple\r\nto tell you as a man who knows what these things are, that this is\r\nan opportunity that doesn\'t come in a man\'s way perhaps twice in his\r\nlife."\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton found that he had nothing more to say, and went back to\r\nLincoln\'s Inn. He knew very well that Mr. Hartlepod\'s assurances\r\nwere not worth much. Mr. Hartlepod himself and his belongings, the\r\nclerks in his office, the look of the rooms, and the very nature of\r\nthe praises which he had sung, all of them inspired anything but\r\nconfidence. Mr. Wharton was a man of the world; and, though he knew\r\nnothing of City ways, was quite aware that no man in his senses would\r\nlay out L5000 on the mere word of Mr. Hartlepod. But still he was\r\ninclined to make the payment. If only he could secure the absence\r\nof Lopez,--if he could be sure that Lopez would in truth go to\r\nGuatemala, and if also he could induce the man to go without his\r\nwife, he would risk the money. The money would, of course, be thrown\r\naway,--but he would throw it away. Lopez no doubt had declared that\r\nhe would not go without his wife, even though the money were paid\r\nfor him. But the money was an alluring sum! As the pressure upon the\r\nman became greater, Mr. Wharton thought he would probably consent to\r\nleave his wife behind him.\r\n\r\nIn his emergency the barrister went to his attorney and told him\r\neverything. The two lawyers were closeted together for an hour, and\r\nMr. Wharton\'s last words to his old friend were as follows:--"I will\r\nrisk the money, Walker, or rather I will consent absolutely to throw\r\nit away,--as it will be thrown away,--if it can be managed that he\r\nshall in truth go to this place without his wife."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nLizzie\r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot be supposed that Ferdinand Lopez at this time was a very\r\nhappy man. He had, at any rate, once loved his wife, and would have\r\nloved her still could he have trained her to think as he thought,\r\nto share his wishes, and "to put herself into the same boat with\r\nhim,"--as he was wont to describe the unison and sympathy which he\r\nrequired from her. To give him his due, he did not know that he was\r\na villain. When he was exhorting her to "get round her father" he\r\nwas not aware that he was giving her lessons which must shock a\r\nwell-conditioned girl. He did not understand that everything that she\r\nhad discovered of his moral disposition since her marriage was of a\r\nnature to disgust her. And, not understanding all this, he conceived\r\nthat he was grievously wronged by her in that she adhered to her\r\nfather rather than to him. This made him unhappy, and doubly\r\ndisappointed him. He had neither got the wife that he had expected\r\nnor the fortune. But he still thought that the fortune must come if\r\nhe would only hold on to the wife which he had got.\r\n\r\nAnd then everything had gone badly with him since his marriage. He\r\nwas apt, when thinking over his affairs, to attribute all this to the\r\nfears and hesitation and parsimony of Sexty Parker. None of his late\r\nventures with Sexty Parker had been successful. And now Sexty was in\r\na bad condition, very violent, drinking hard, declaring himself to\r\nbe a ruined man, and swearing that if this and that were not done\r\nhe would have bitter revenge. Sexty still believed in the wealth of\r\nhis partner\'s father-in-law, and still had some hope of salvation\r\nfrom that source. Lopez would declare to him, and up to this very\r\ntime persevered in protesting, that salvation was to be found in\r\nBios. If Sexty would only risk two or three thousand pounds more\r\nupon Bios,--or his credit to that amount, failing the immediate\r\nmoney,--things might still be right. "Bios be d----," said Sexty,\r\nuttering a string of heavy imprecations. On that morning he had been\r\ntrusting to native produce rather than to the new African spirit. But\r\nnow as the Guatemala scheme really took form and loomed on Lopez\'s\r\neyesight as a thing that might be real, he endeavoured to keep out of\r\nSexty\'s way. But in vain; Sexty too had heard of Guatemala, and in\r\nhis misery hunted Lopez about the city. "By G----, I believe you\'re\r\nafraid to come to Little Tankard Yard," he said one day, having\r\ncaught his victim under the equestrian statue in front of the\r\nExchange.\r\n\r\n"What is the good of my coming when you will do nothing when I am\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what it is, Lopez,--you\'re not going out of the\r\ncountry about this mining business, if I know it."\r\n\r\n"Who said I was?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll put a spoke in your wheel there, my man. I\'ll give a written\r\naccount of all the dealings between us to the Directors. By G----,\r\nthey shall know their man."\r\n\r\n"You\'re an ass, Sexty, and always were. Look here. If I can carry\r\non as though I were going to this place, I can draw L5000 from\r\nold Wharton. He has already offered it. He has treated me with a\r\nstinginess that I never knew equalled. Had he done what I had a right\r\nto expect, you and I would have been rich men now. But at last I have\r\ngot a hold upon him up to L5000. As you and I stand, pretty nearly\r\nthe whole of that will go to you. But don\'t you spoil it all by\r\nmaking an ass of yourself."\r\n\r\nSexty, who was three parts drunk, looked up into his face for a few\r\nseconds, and then made his reply. "I\'m d----d if I believe a word of\r\nit." Upon this Lopez affected to laugh, and then made his escape.\r\n\r\nAll this, as I have said, did not tend to make his life happy. Though\r\nhe had impudence enough, and callousness of conscience enough, to get\r\nhis bills paid by Mr. Wharton as often as he could, he was not quite\r\neasy in his mind while doing so. His ambition had never been high,\r\nbut it had soared higher than that. He had had great hopes. He had\r\nlived with some high people. He had dined with lords and ladies.\r\nHe had been the guest of a Duchess. He had married the daughter of\r\na gentleman. He had nearly been a member of Parliament. He still\r\nbelonged to what he considered to be a first-rate club. From a great\r\naltitude he looked down upon Sexty Parker and men of Sexty\'s class,\r\nbecause of his social successes, and because he knew how to talk and\r\nto look like a gentleman. It was unpleasant to him, therefore, to be\r\ndriven to the life he was now living. And the idea of going out to\r\nGuatemala and burying himself in a mine in Central America was not to\r\nhim a happy idea. In spite of all that he had done he had still some\r\nhope that he might avoid that banishment. He had spoken the truth\r\nto Sexty Parker in saying that he intended to get the L5000 from\r\nMr. Wharton without that terrible personal sacrifice, though he had\r\nhardly spoken the truth when he assured his friend that the greater\r\nportion of that money would go to him. There were many schemes\r\nfluctuating through his brain, and all accompanied by many doubts.\r\nIf he could get Mr. Wharton\'s money by giving up his wife, should he\r\nconsent to give her up? In either case should he stay or should he\r\ngo? Should he run one further great chance with Bios,--and if so, by\r\nwhose assistance? And if he should at last decide that he would do so\r\nby the aid of a certain friend that was yet left to him, should he\r\nthrow himself at that friend\'s feet, the friend being a lady, and\r\npropose to desert his wife and begin the world again with her? For\r\nthe lady in question was a lady in possession, as he believed, of\r\nvery large means. Or should he cut his throat and have done at once\r\nwith all his troubles, acknowledging to himself that his career\r\nhad been a failure, and that, therefore, it might be brought with\r\nadvantage to an end? "After all," said he to himself, "that may be\r\nthe best way of winding up a bankrupt concern."\r\n\r\nOur old friend Lady Eustace, in these days, lived in a very small\r\nhouse in a very small street bordering upon May Fair; but the street,\r\nthough very small, and having disagreeable relations with a mews,\r\nstill had an air of fashion about it. And with her lived the widow,\r\nMrs. Leslie, who had introduced her to Mrs. Dick Roby, and through\r\nMrs. Roby to Ferdinand Lopez. Lady Eustace was in the enjoyment of a\r\nhandsome income, as I hope that some of my readers may remember,--and\r\nthis income, during the last year or two, she had learned to foster,\r\nif not with much discretion, at any rate with great zeal. During\r\nher short life she had had many aspirations. Love, poetry, sport,\r\nreligion, fashion, Bohemianism had all been tried; but in each crisis\r\nthere had been a certain care for wealth which had saved her from the\r\nfolly of squandering what she had won by her early energies in the\r\npursuit of her then prevailing passion. She had given her money to no\r\nlover, had not lost it on race-courses, or in building churches;--nor\r\neven had she materially damaged her resources by servants and\r\nequipages. At the present time she was still young, and still\r\npretty,--though her hair and complexion took rather more time than\r\nin the days when she won Sir Florian Eustace. She still liked a\r\nlover,--or perhaps two,--though she had thoroughly convinced herself\r\nthat a lover may be bought too dear. She could still ride a horse,\r\nthough hunting regularly was too expensive for her. She could\r\ntalk religion if she could find herself close to a well-got-up\r\nclergyman,--being quite indifferent as to the denomination of the\r\nreligion. But perhaps a wild dash for a time into fast vulgarity was\r\nwhat in her heart of hearts she liked best,--only that it was so\r\ndifficult to enjoy that pleasure without risk of losing everything.\r\nAnd then, together with these passions, and perhaps above them all,\r\nthere had lately sprung up in the heart of Lady Eustace a desire to\r\nmultiply her means by successful speculation. This was the friend\r\nwith whom Lopez had lately become intimate, and by whose aid he hoped\r\nto extricate himself from some of his difficulties.\r\n\r\nPoor as he was he had contrived to bribe Mrs. Leslie by handsome\r\npresents out of Bond Street;--for, as he still lived in Manchester\r\nSquare, and was the undoubted son-in-law of Mr. Wharton, his credit\r\nwas not altogether gone. In the giving of these gifts no purport was,\r\nof course, named, but Mrs. Leslie was probably aware that her good\r\nword with her friend was expected. "I only know what I used to hear\r\nfrom Mrs. Roby," Mrs. Leslie said to her friend. "He was mixed up\r\nwith Hunkey\'s people, who roll in money; Old Wharton wouldn\'t have\r\ngiven him his daughter if he had not been doing well."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very hard to be sure," said Lizzie Eustace.\r\n\r\n"He looks like a man who\'d know how to feather his own nest," said\r\nMrs. Leslie. "Don\'t you think he\'s very handsome?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he\'s likely to do the better for that."\r\n\r\n"Well; no; but there are men of whom you are sure, when you look at\r\nthem, that they\'ll be successful. I don\'t suppose he was anything to\r\nbegin with, but see where he is now!"\r\n\r\n"I believe you are in love with him, my dear," said Lizzie Eustace.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly. I don\'t know that he has given me any provocation. But\r\nI don\'t see why a woman shouldn\'t be in love with him if she likes.\r\nHe is a deal nicer than those fair-haired men who haven\'t got a\r\nword to say to you, and yet look as though you ought to jump down\r\ntheir mouths;--like that fellow you were trying to talk to last\r\nnight;--that Mr. Fletcher. He could just jerk out three words at a\r\ntime, and yet he was proud as Lucifer. I like a man who if he likes\r\nme is neither ashamed nor afraid to say so."\r\n\r\n"There is a romance there, you know. Mr. Fletcher was in love with\r\nEmily Wharton, and she threw him over for Lopez. They say he has not\r\nheld up his head since."\r\n\r\n"She was quite right," said Mrs. Leslie. "But she is one of those\r\nstiff-necked creatures who are set up with pride though they have\r\nnothing to be proud of. I suppose she had a lot of money. Lopez would\r\nnever have taken her without."\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, Lopez called one day at the little house in the\r\nlittle street he was not an unwelcome visitor. Mrs. Leslie was in\r\nthe drawing-room, but soon left it after his arrival. He had of late\r\nbeen often there, and when he at once introduced the subject on which\r\nhe was himself intent it was not unexpected. "Seven thousand five\r\nhundred pounds!" said Lizzie, after listening to the proposition\r\nwhich he had come to make. "That is a very large sum of money!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it\'s a large sum of money. It\'s a large affair. I\'m in it to\r\nrather more than that, I believe."\r\n\r\n"How are you to get people to drink it?" she asked after a pause.\r\n\r\n"By telling them that they ought to drink it. Advertise it. It has\r\nbecome a certainty now that if you will only advertise sufficiently\r\nyou may make a fortune by selling anything. Only the interest on\r\nthe money expended increases in so large a ratio in accordance with\r\nthe magnitude of the operation! If you spend a few hundreds in\r\nadvertising you throw them away. A hundred thousand pounds well laid\r\nout makes a certainty of anything."\r\n\r\n"What am I to get to show for my money;--I mean immediately, you\r\nknow?"\r\n\r\n"Registered shares in the Company."\r\n\r\n"The Bios Company?"\r\n\r\n"No;--we did propose to call ourselves Parker and Co., limited. I\r\nthink we shall change the name. They will probably use my name. Lopez\r\nand Co., limited."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s all for Bios?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--all for Bios."\r\n\r\n"And it\'s to come from Central Africa?"\r\n\r\n"It will be rectified in London, you know. Some English spirit will\r\nperhaps be mixed. But I must not tell you the secrets of the trade\r\ntill you join us. That Bios is distilled from the bark of the\r\nDuffer-tree is a certainty."\r\n\r\n"Have you drank any?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve tasted it."\r\n\r\n"Is it nice?"\r\n\r\n"Very nice;--rather sweet, you know, and will be the better for\r\nmixing."\r\n\r\n"Gin?" suggested her ladyship.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so,--or whisky. I think I may say that you can\'t do very\r\nmuch better with your money. You know I would not say this to you\r\nwere it not true. In such a matter I treat you just as if,--as if you\r\nwere my sister."\r\n\r\n"I know how good you are,--but seven thousand five hundred! I\r\ncouldn\'t raise so much as that just at present."\r\n\r\n"There are to be six shares," said Lopez, "making L45,000 capital.\r\nWould you consent to take a share jointly with me? That would be\r\nthree thousand seven hundred and fifty."\r\n\r\n"But you have a share already," said Lizzie suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"I should then divide that with Mr. Parker. We intend to register at\r\nany rate as many as nine partners. Would you object to hold it with\r\nme?" Lopez, as he asked the question, looked at her as though he were\r\noffering her half his heart.\r\n\r\n"No," said Lizzie, slowly, "I don\'t suppose I should object to that."\r\n\r\n"I should be doubly eager about the affair if I were in partnership\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s such a venture."\r\n\r\n"Nothing venture nothing have."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve got something as it is, Mr. Lopez, and I don\'t want to lose\r\nit all."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no chance of that if you join us."\r\n\r\n"You think Bios is so sure!"\r\n\r\n"Quite safe," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"You must give me a little more time to think about it," said Lady\r\nEustace at last, panting with anxiety, struggling with herself,\r\nanxious for the excitement which would come to her from dealing in\r\nBios, but still fearing to risk her money.\r\n\r\nThis had taken place immediately after Mr. Wharton\'s offer of the\r\nL5000, in making which he had stipulated that Emily should be left at\r\nhome. Then a few days went by, and Lopez was pressed for his money at\r\nthe office of the San Juan mine. Did he or did he not mean to take up\r\nthe mining shares allotted to him? If he did mean to do so, he must\r\ndo it at once. He swore by all his gods that of course he meant to\r\ntake them up. Had not Mr. Wharton himself been at the office saying\r\nthat he intended to pay for them? Was not that sufficient guarantee?\r\nThey knew well enough that Mr. Wharton was a man to whom the raising\r\nof L5000 could be a matter of no difficulty. But they did not know,\r\nnever could know, how impossible it was to get anything done by Mr.\r\nWharton. But Mr. Wharton had promised to pay for the shares, and when\r\nmoney was concerned his word would surely suffice. Mr. Hartlepod,\r\nbacked by two of the Directors, said that if the thing was to go on\r\nat all, the money must really be paid at once. But the conference was\r\nended by allowing the new local manager another fortnight in which to\r\ncomplete the arrangement.\r\n\r\nLopez allowed four days to pass by, during each of which he was\r\ncloseted for a time with Lady Eustace, and then made an attempt to\r\nget at Mr. Wharton through his wife. "Your father has said that he\r\nwill pay the money for me," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"If he has said so he certainly will do it."\r\n\r\n"But he has promised it on the condition that you should remain\r\nat home. Do you wish to desert your husband?" To this she made no\r\nimmediate answer. "Are you already anxious to be rid of me?"\r\n\r\n"I should prefer to remain at home," she said in a very low voice.\r\n\r\n"Then you do wish to desert your husband?"\r\n\r\n"What is the use of all this, Ferdinand? You do not love me. You did\r\nnot marry me because I loved you."\r\n\r\n"By heaven I did;--for that and that only."\r\n\r\n"And how have you treated me?"\r\n\r\n"What have I done to you?"\r\n\r\n"But I do not mean to make accusations, Ferdinand. I should only add\r\nto our miseries by that. We should be happier apart."\r\n\r\n"Not I. Nor is that my idea of marriage. Tell your father that you\r\nwish to go with me, and then he will let us have the money."\r\n\r\n"I will tell him no lie, Ferdinand. If you bid me go, I will go.\r\nWhere you find a home I must find one too if it be your pleasure to\r\ntake me. But I will not ask my father to give you money because it is\r\nmy pleasure to go. Were I to say so he would not believe me."\r\n\r\n"It is you who have told him to give it me only on the condition of\r\nyour staying."\r\n\r\n"I have told him nothing. He knows that I do not wish to go. He\r\ncannot but know that. But he knows that I mean to go if you require\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"And you will do nothing for me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing,--in regard to my father." He raised his fist with the\r\nthought of striking her, and she saw the motion. But his arm fell\r\nagain to his side. He had not quite come to that yet. "Surely you\r\nwill have the charity to tell me whether I am to go, if it be fixed,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n"Have I not told you so twenty times?"\r\n\r\n"Then it is fixed."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it is fixed. Your father will tell you about your things.\r\nHe has promised you some beggarly sum,--about as much as a\r\ntallow-chandler would give his daughter."\r\n\r\n"Whatever he does for me will be sufficient for me. I am not afraid\r\nof my father, Ferdinand."\r\n\r\n"You shall be afraid of me before I have done with you," said he,\r\nleaving the room.\r\n\r\nThen as he sat at his club, dining there alone, there came across\r\nhis mind ideas of what the world would be like to him if he could\r\nleave his wife at home and take Lizzie Eustace with him to Guatemala.\r\nGuatemala was very distant, and it would matter little there whether\r\nthe woman he brought with him was his wife or no. It was clear enough\r\nto him that his wife desired no more of his company. What were the\r\nconventions of the world to him? This other woman had money at her\r\nown command. He could not make it his own because he could not marry\r\nher, but he fancied that it might be possible to bring her so far\r\nunder his control as to make the money almost as good as his own.\r\nMr. Wharton\'s money was very hard to reach, and would be as hard to\r\nreach,--perhaps harder,--when Mr. Wharton was dead, as now, during\r\nhis life. He had said a good deal to the lady since the interview of\r\nwhich a report has been given. She had declared herself to be afraid\r\nof Bios. She did not in the least doubt that great things might be\r\nultimately done with Bios, but she did not quite see the way with her\r\nsmall capital,--thus humbly did she speak of her wealth,--to be one\r\nof those who should take the initiative in the matter. Bios evidently\r\nrequired a great deal of advertisement, and Lizzie Eustace had a\r\nshort-sighted objection to expend what money she had saved on the\r\nhoardings of London. Then he opened to her the glories of Guatemala,\r\nnot contenting himself with describing the certainty of the 20 per\r\ncent., but enlarging on the luxurious happiness of life in a country\r\nso golden, so green, so gorgeous, and so grand. It had been the\r\nvery apple of the eye of the old Spaniards. In Guatemala, he said,\r\nCortez and Pizarro had met and embraced. They might have done so for\r\nanything Lizzie Eustace knew to the contrary. And here our hero took\r\nadvantage of his name. Don Diego di Lopez had been the first to raise\r\nthe banner of freedom in Guatemala when the kings of Spain became\r\ntyrants to their American subjects. All is fair in love and war, and\r\nLizzie amidst the hard business of her life still loved a dash of\r\nromance. Yes, he was about to change the scene and try his fortune in\r\nthat golden, green, and gorgeous country. "You will take your wife of\r\ncourse," Lady Eustace had said. Then Lopez had smiled, and shrugging\r\nhis shoulders had left the room.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly the fact that she could not eat him. Other men\r\nbefore Lopez have had to pick up what courage they could in their\r\nattacks upon women by remembering that fact. She had flirted with him\r\nin a very pleasant way, mixing up her prettiness and her percentages\r\nin a manner that was peculiar to herself. He did not know her, and he\r\nknew that he did not know her;--but still there was the chance. She\r\nhad thrown his wife more than once in his face, after the fashion of\r\nwomen when they are wooed by married men since the days of Cleopatra\r\ndownwards. But he had taken that simply as encouragement. He had\r\nalready let her know that his wife was a vixen who troubled his life.\r\nLizzie had given him her sympathy, and had almost given him a tear.\r\n"But I am not a man to be broken-hearted because I have made a\r\nmistake," said Lopez. "Marriage vows are very well, but they shall\r\nnever bind me to misery." "Marriage vows are not very well. They may\r\nbe very ill," Lizzie had replied, remembering certain passages in her\r\nown life.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about her money, and certainly she could not eat\r\nhim. The fortnight allowed him by the San Juan Company had nearly\r\ngone by when he called at the little house in the little street,\r\nresolved to push his fortune in that direction without fear and\r\nwithout hesitation. Mrs. Leslie again took her departure, leaving\r\nthem together, and Lizzie allowed her friend to go, although the last\r\nwords that Lopez had spoken had been, as he thought, a fair prelude\r\nto the words he intended to speak to-day. "And what do you think of\r\nit?" he said, taking both her hands in his.\r\n\r\n"Think of what?"\r\n\r\n"Of our Spanish venture."\r\n\r\n"Have you given up Bios, my friend?"\r\n\r\n"No; certainly not," said Lopez, seating himself beside her. "I have\r\nnot taken the other half share, but I have kept my old venture in the\r\nscheme. I believe in Bios, you know."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--it is so nice to believe."\r\n\r\n"But I believe more firmly in the country to which I am going."\r\n\r\n"You are going then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my friend;--I am going. The allurements are too strong to\r\nbe resisted. Think of that climate and of this." He probably had\r\nnot heard of the mosquitoes of Central America when he so spoke.\r\n"Remember that an income which gives you comfort here will there\r\nproduce for you every luxury which wealth can purchase. It is to be\r\na king there, or to be but very common among commoners here."\r\n\r\n"And yet England is a dear old country."\r\n\r\n"Have you found it so? Think of the wrongs which you have\r\nendured;--of the injuries which you have suffered."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed." For Lizzie Eustace had gone through hard days in her\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"I certainly will fly from such a country to those golden shores on\r\nwhich man may be free and unshackled."\r\n\r\n"And your wife?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lizzie!" It was the first time that he had called her Lizzie,\r\nand she was apparently neither shocked nor abashed. Perhaps he\r\nthought too much of this, not knowing how many men had called her\r\nLizzie in her time. "Do not you at least understand that a man or a\r\nwoman may undergo that tie, and yet be justified in disregarding it\r\naltogether?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--if there has been bigamy, or divorce, or anything of that\r\nkind." Now Lizzie had convicted her second husband of bigamy, and had\r\nfreed herself after that fashion.\r\n\r\n"To h---- with their prurient laws," said Lopez, rising suddenly from\r\nhis chair. "I will neither appeal to them nor will I obey them. And\r\nI expect from you as little subservience as I myself am prepared to\r\npay. Lizzie Eustace, will you go with me, to that land of the sun,\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle,\r\n    Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime?_\r\n\r\n\r\nWill you dare to escape with me from the cold conventionalities, from\r\nthe miserable thraldom of this country bound in swaddling cloths?\r\nLizzie Eustace, if you will say the word, I will take you to that\r\nland of glorious happiness."\r\n\r\nBut Lizzie Eustace had L4000 a year and a balance at her banker\'s.\r\n"Mr. Lopez," she said.\r\n\r\n"What answer have you to make me?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lopez, I think you must be a fool."\r\n\r\nHe did at last succeed in getting himself into the street, and at any\r\nrate she had not eaten him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\nMrs. Parker\'s Sorrows\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of February had come, and as far as Mrs. Lopez knew she was\r\nto start for Guatemala in a month\'s time. And yet there was so much\r\nof indecision in her husband\'s manner, and apparently so little done\r\nby him in regard to personal preparation, that she could hardly bring\r\nherself to feel certain that she would have to make the journey. From\r\nday to day her father would ask her whether she had made her intended\r\npurchases, and she would tell him that she had still postponed the\r\nwork. Then he would say no more, for he himself was hesitating,\r\ndoubtful what he would do, and still thinking that when at last the\r\ntime should come, he would buy his daughter\'s release at any price\r\nthat might be demanded. Mr. Walker, the attorney, had as yet been\r\nable to manage nothing. He had seen Lopez more than once, and had\r\nalso seen Mr. Hartlepod. Mr. Hartlepod had simply told him that he\r\nwould be very happy to register the shares on behalf of Lopez as soon\r\nas the money was paid. Lopez had been almost insolent in his bearing.\r\n"Did Mr. Wharton think," he asked, "that he was going to sell his\r\nwife for L5000?" "I think you\'ll have to raise your offer," Mr.\r\nWalker had said to Mr. Wharton. That was all very well. Mr. Wharton\r\nwas willing enough to raise his offer. He would have doubled his\r\noffer could he thereby have secured the annihilation of Lopez. "I\r\nwill raise it if he will go without his wife, and give her a written\r\nassurance that he will never trouble her again." But the arrangement\r\nwas one which Mr. Walker found it very difficult to carry out. So\r\nthings went on till the end of February had come.\r\n\r\nAnd during all this time Lopez was still resident in Mr. Wharton\'s\r\nhouse. "Papa," she said to him one day, "this is the cruellest thing\r\nof all. Why don\'t you tell him that he must go?"\r\n\r\n"Because he would take you with him."\r\n\r\n"It would be better so. I could come to see you."\r\n\r\n"I did tell him to go,--in my passion. I repented of it instantly,\r\nbecause I should have lost you. But what did my telling matter to\r\nhim? He was very indignant, and yet he is still here."\r\n\r\n"You told him to go?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--but I am glad that he did not obey me. There must be an end to\r\nthis soon, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I do not know, papa."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that he will not go?"\r\n\r\n"I feel that I know nothing, papa. You must not let him stay here\r\nalways, you know."\r\n\r\n"And what will become of you when he goes?"\r\n\r\n"I must go with him. Why should you be sacrificed also? I will tell\r\nhim that he must leave the house. I am not afraid of him, papa."\r\n\r\n"Not yet, my dear;--not yet. We will see."\r\n\r\nAt this time Lopez declared his purpose one day of dining at the\r\nProgress, and Mr. Wharton took advantage of the occasion to remain\r\nat home with his daughter. Everett was now expected, and there was a\r\nprobability that he might come on this evening. Mr. Wharton therefore\r\nreturned from his chambers early; but when he reached the house he\r\nwas told that there was a woman in the dining-room with Mrs. Lopez.\r\nThe servant did not know what woman. She had asked to see Mrs. Lopez,\r\nand Mrs. Lopez had gone down to her.\r\n\r\nThe woman in the dining-room was Mrs. Parker. She had called at the\r\nhouse at about half-past five, and Emily had at once come down when\r\nsummoned by tidings that a "lady" wanted to see her. Servants have a\r\nway of announcing a woman as a lady, which clearly expresses their\r\nown opinion that the person in question is not a lady. So it had\r\nbeen on the present occasion, but Mrs. Lopez had at once gone to her\r\nvisitor. "Oh, Mrs. Parker, I am so glad to see you. I hope you are\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, then, Mrs. Lopez, I am very far from well. No poor woman,\r\nwho is the mother of five children, was ever farther from being well\r\nthan I am."\r\n\r\n"Is anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Wrong, ma\'am! Everything is wrong. When is Mr. Lopez going to pay my\r\nhusband all the money he has took from him?"\r\n\r\n"Has he taken money?"\r\n\r\n"Taken! he has taken everything. He has shorn my husband as bare as a\r\nboard. We\'re ruined, Mrs. Lopez, and it\'s your husband has done it.\r\nWhen we were at Dovercourt, I told you how it was going to be. His\r\nbusiness has left him, and now there is nothing. What are we to do?"\r\nThe woman was seated on a chair, leaning forward with her two hands\r\non her knees. The day was wet, the streets were half mud and half\r\nsnow, and the poor woman, who had made her way through the slush, was\r\nsoiled and wet. "I look to you to tell me what me and my children is\r\nto do. He\'s your husband, Mrs. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mrs. Parker; he is my husband."\r\n\r\n"Why couldn\'t he let Sexty alone? Why should the like of him be\r\ntaking the bread out of my children\'s mouths? What had we ever done\r\nto him? You\'re rich."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am not, Mrs. Parker."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are. You\'re living here in a grand house, and your father\'s\r\nmade of money. You\'ll know nothing of want, let the worst come to\r\nthe worst. What are we to do, Mrs. Lopez? I\'m the wife of that poor\r\ncreature, and you\'re the wife of the man that has ruined him. What\r\nare we to do, Mrs. Lopez?"\r\n\r\n"I do not understand my husband\'s business, Mrs. Parker."\r\n\r\n"You\'re one with him, ain\'t you? If anybody had ever come to me and\r\nsaid my husband had robbed him, I\'d never have stopped till I knew\r\nthe truth of it. If any woman had ever said to me that Parker had\r\ntaken the bread out of her children\'s mouths, do you think that I\'d\r\nsit as you are sitting? I tell you that Lopez has robbed us,--has\r\nrobbed us, and taken everything."\r\n\r\n"What can I say, Mrs. Parker;--what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"He is not here. He is dining at his club."\r\n\r\n"Where is that? I will go there and shame him before them all. Don\'t\r\nyou feel no shame? Because you\'ve got things comfortable here, I\r\nsuppose it\'s all nothing to you. You don\'t care, though my children\r\nwere starving in the gutter,--as they will do."\r\n\r\n"If you knew me, Mrs. Parker, you wouldn\'t speak to me like that."\r\n\r\n"Know you! Of course I know you. You\'re a lady, and your father\'s a\r\nrich man, and your husband thinks no end of himself. And we\'re poor\r\npeople, so it don\'t matter whether we\'re robbed and ruined or not.\r\nThat\'s about it."\r\n\r\n"If I had anything, I\'d give you all that I had."\r\n\r\n"And he\'s taken to drinking that hard that he\'s never rightly sober\r\nfrom morning to night." As she told this story of her husband\'s\r\ndisgrace, the poor woman burst into tears. "Who\'s to trust him with\r\nbusiness now? He\'s that broken-hearted that he don\'t know which way\r\nto turn,--only to the bottle. And Lopez has done it all,--done it\r\nall! I haven\'t got a father, ma\'am, who has got a house over his\r\nhead for me and my babies. Only think if you was turned out into the\r\nstreet with your babby, as I am like to be."\r\n\r\n"I have no baby," said the wretched woman through her tears and sobs.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you, Mrs. Lopez? Oh dear!" exclaimed the soft-hearted woman,\r\nreduced at once to pity. "How was it then?"\r\n\r\n"He died, Mrs. Parker,--just a few days after he was born."\r\n\r\n"Did he now? Well, well. We all have our troubles, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I have mine, I know," said Emily, "and very, very heavy they are. I\r\ncannot tell you what I have to suffer."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he good to you?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot talk about it, Mrs. Parker. What you tell me about yourself\r\nhas added greatly to my sorrows. My husband is talking of going\r\naway,--to live out of England."\r\n\r\n"Yes, at a place they call--I forget what they call it, but I heard\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Guatemala,--in America."\r\n\r\n"I know. Sexty told me. He has no business to go anywhere, while he\r\nowes Sexty such a lot of money. He has taken everything, and now he\'s\r\ngoing to Kattymaly!" At this moment Mr. Wharton knocked at the door\r\nand entered the room. As he did so Mrs. Parker got up and curtseyed.\r\n\r\n"This is my father, Mrs. Parker," said Emily. "Papa, this is Mrs.\r\nParker. She is the wife of Mr. Parker, who was Ferdinand\'s partner.\r\nShe has come here with bad news."\r\n\r\n"Very bad news indeed, sir," said Mrs. Parker, curtseying again. Mr.\r\nWharton frowned, not as being angry with the woman, but feeling that\r\nsome further horror was to be told him of his son-in-law. "I can\'t\r\nhelp coming, sir," continued Mrs. Parker. "Where am I to go if I\r\ndon\'t come? Mr. Lopez, sir, has ruined us root and branch,--root and\r\nbranch."\r\n\r\n"That at any rate is not my fault," said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"But she is his wife, sir. Where am I to go if not to where he lives?\r\nAm I to put up with everything gone, and my poor husband in the right\r\nway to go to Bedlam, and not to say a word about it to the grand\r\nrelations of him who did it all?"\r\n\r\n"He is a bad man," said Mr. Wharton. "I cannot make him otherwise."\r\n\r\n"Will he do nothing for us?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you all I know about him." Then Mr. Wharton did tell\r\nher all that he knew, as to the appointment at Guatemala and the\r\namount of salary which was to be attached to it. "Whether he will do\r\nanything for you, I cannot say;--I should think not, unless he be\r\nforced. I should advise you to go to the offices of the Company in\r\nColeman Street and try to make some terms there. But I fear,--I fear\r\nit will be all useless."\r\n\r\n"Then we may starve."\r\n\r\n"It is not her fault," said Mr. Wharton, pointing to his daughter.\r\n"She has had no hand in it. She knows less of it all than you do."\r\n\r\n"It is my fault," said Emily, bursting out into self-reproach,--"my\r\nfault that I married him."\r\n\r\n"Whether married or single he would have preyed upon Mr. Parker to\r\nthe same extent."\r\n\r\n"Like enough," said the poor wife. "He\'d prey upon anybody as he\r\ncould get a-hold of. And so, Mr. Wharton, you think that you can do\r\nnothing for me."\r\n\r\n"If your want be immediate I can relieve it," said the barrister.\r\nMrs. Parker did not like the idea of accepting direct charity, but,\r\nnevertheless, on going away did take the five sovereigns which Mr.\r\nWharton offered to her.\r\n\r\nAfter such an interview as that the dinner between the father and the\r\ndaughter was not very happy. She was eaten up by remorse. Gradually\r\nshe had learned how frightful was the thing she had done in giving\r\nherself to a man of whom she had known nothing. And it was not only\r\nthat she had degraded herself by loving such a man, but that she had\r\nbeen persistent in clinging to him though her father and all his\r\nfriends had told her of the danger which she was running. And now\r\nit seemed that she had destroyed her father as well as herself! All\r\nthat she could do was to be persistent in her prayer that he would\r\nlet her go. "I have done it," she said that night, "and I could bear\r\nit better, if you would let me bear it alone." But he only kissed\r\nher, and sobbed over her, and held her close to his heart with his\r\nclinging arms,--in a manner in which he had never held her in their\r\nold happy days.\r\n\r\nHe took himself to his own rooms before Lopez returned, but she of\r\ncourse had to bear her husband\'s presence. As she had declared to\r\nher father more than once, she was not afraid of him. Even though\r\nhe should strike her,--though he should kill her,--she would not be\r\nafraid of him. He had already done worse to her than anything that\r\ncould follow. "Mrs. Parker has been here to-day," she said to him\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\n"And what had Mrs. Parker to say?"\r\n\r\n"That you had ruined her husband."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. When a man speculates and doesn\'t win of course he throws\r\nthe blame on some one else. And when he is too much of a cur to come\r\nhimself, he sends his wife."\r\n\r\n"She says you owe him money."\r\n\r\n"What business have you to listen to what she says? If she comes\r\nagain, do not see her. Do you understand me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I understand. She saw papa also. If you owe him money, should\r\nit not be paid?"\r\n\r\n"My dearest love, everybody who owes anything to anybody should\r\nalways pay it. That is so self-evident that one would almost suppose\r\nthat it might be understood without being enunciated. But the virtue\r\nof paying your debts is incompatible with an absence of money. Now,\r\nif you please, we will not say anything more about Mrs. Parker. She\r\nis not at any rate a fit companion for you."\r\n\r\n"It was you who introduced me to her."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue about her,--and let that be an end of it. I little\r\nknew what a world of torment I was preparing for myself when I\r\nallowed you to come and live in your father\'s house."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\nWhat the Duchess Thought of Her Husband\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Session began it was understood in the political world that\r\na very strong opposition was to be organised against the Government\r\nunder the guidance of Sir Orlando Drought, and that the great sin to\r\nbe imputed to the Cabinet was an utter indifference to the safety\r\nand honour of Great Britain, as manifested by their neglect of the\r\nnavy. All the world knew that Sir Orlando had deserted the Coalition\r\nbecause he was not allowed to build new ships, and of course Sir\r\nOrlando would make the most of his grievance. With him was joined\r\nMr. Boffin, the patriotic Conservative who had never listened to\r\nthe voice of the seducer, and the staunch remainder of the old Tory\r\nparty. And with them the more violent of the Radicals were prepared\r\nto act, not desirous, indeed, that new ships should be built, or that\r\na Conservative Government should be established,--or, indeed, that\r\nanything should be done,--but animated by intense disgust that so\r\nmild a politician as the Duke of Omnium should be Prime Minister.\r\nThe fight began at once, Sir Orlando objecting violently to certain\r\npassages in the Queen\'s Speech. It was all very well to say that the\r\ncountry was at present at peace with all the world; but how was peace\r\nto be maintained without a fleet? Then Sir Orlando paid a great many\r\ncompliments to the Duke, and ended his speech by declaring him to be\r\nthe most absolutely faineant minister that had disgraced the country\r\nsince the days of the Duke of Newcastle. Mr. Monk defended the\r\nCoalition, and assured the House that the navy was not only the most\r\npowerful navy existing, but that it was the most powerful that ever\r\nhad existed in the possession of this or any other country, and was\r\nprobably in absolute efficiency superior to the combined navies of\r\nall the world. The House was not shocked by statements so absolutely\r\nat variance with each other, coming from two gentlemen who had lately\r\nbeen members of the same Government, and who must be supposed to\r\nknow what they were talking about, but seemed to think that upon the\r\nwhole Sir Orlando had done his duty. For though there was complete\r\nconfidence in the navy as a navy, and though a very small minority\r\nwould have voted for any considerably increased expense, still it\r\nwas well that there should be an opposition. And how can there be an\r\nopposition without some subject for grumbling,--some matter on which\r\na minister may be attacked? No one really thought that the Prussians\r\nand French combined would invade our shores and devastate our fields,\r\nand plunder London, and carry our daughters away into captivity. The\r\nstate of the funds showed very plainly that there was no such fear.\r\nBut a good cry is a very good thing,--and it is always well to rub\r\nup the officials of the Admiralty by a little wholesome abuse. Sir\r\nOrlando was thought to have done his business well. Of course he did\r\nnot risk a division upon the address. Had he done so he would have\r\nbeen "nowhere." But, as it was, he was proud of his achievement.\r\n\r\nThe ministers generally would have been indifferent to the very hard\r\nwords that were said of them, knowing what they were worth, and\r\nfeeling aware that a ministry which had everything too easy must lose\r\nits interest in the country, had it not been that their chief was\r\nvery sore on the subject. The old Duke\'s work at this time consisted\r\nalmost altogether in nursing the younger Duke. It did sometimes occur\r\nto his elder Grace that it might be well to let his brother retire,\r\nand that a Prime Minister, malgre lui, could not be a successful\r\nPrime Minister, or a useful one. But if the Duke of Omnium went the\r\nCoalition must go too, and the Coalition had been the offspring of\r\nthe old statesman. The country was thriving under the Coalition, and\r\nthere was no real reason why it should not last for the next ten\r\nyears. He continued, therefore, his system of coddling, and was ready\r\nat any moment, or at every moment, to pour, if not comfort, at any\r\nrate consolation into the ears of his unhappy friend. In the present\r\nemergency, it was the falsehood and general baseness of Sir Orlando\r\nwhich nearly broke the heart of the Prime Minister. "How is one to\r\nlive," he said, "if one has to do with men of that kind?"\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t to do with him any longer," said the Duke of St.\r\nBungay.\r\n\r\n"When I see a man who is supposed to have earned the name of a\r\nstatesman, and been high in the councils of his sovereign, induced\r\nby personal jealousy to do as he is doing, it makes me feel that an\r\nhonest man should not place himself where he may have to deal with\r\nsuch persons."\r\n\r\n"According to that the honest men are to desert their country in\r\norder that the dishonest men may have everything their own way." Our\r\nDuke could not answer this, and therefore for the moment he yielded.\r\nBut he was unhappy, saturnine, and generally silent except when\r\ncloseted with his ancient mentor. And he knew that he was saturnine\r\nand silent, and that it behoved him as a leader of men to be genial\r\nand communicative,--listening to counsel even if he did not follow\r\nit, and at any rate appearing to have confidence in his colleagues.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Mr. Slide was not inactive, and in his heart of\r\nhearts the Prime Minister was more afraid of Mr. Slide\'s attacks than\r\nof those made upon him by Sir Orlando Drought. Now that Parliament\r\nwas sitting, and the minds of men were stirred to political feeling\r\nby the renewed energy of the House, a great deal was being said in\r\nmany quarters about the last Silverbridge election. The papers had\r\ntaken the matter up generally, some accusing the Prime Minister and\r\nsome defending. But the defence was almost as unpalatable to him as\r\nthe accusation. It was admitted on all sides that the Duke, both\r\nas a peer and as a Prime Minister, should have abstained from any\r\ninterference whatever in the election. And it was also admitted on\r\nall sides that he had not so abstained,--if there was any truth at\r\nall in the allegation that he had paid money for Mr. Lopez. But\r\nit was pleaded on his behalf that the Dukes of Omnium had always\r\ninterfered at Silverbridge, and that no Reform Bill had ever had any\r\neffect in reducing their influence in that borough. Frequent allusion\r\nwas made to the cautious Dod who, year after year, had reported that\r\nthe Duke of Omnium exercised considerable influence in the borough.\r\nAnd then the friendly newspapers went on to explain that the Duke had\r\nin this instance stayed his hand, and that the money, if paid at all,\r\nhad been paid because the candidate who was to have been his nominee\r\nhad been thrown over, when the Duke at the last moment made up his\r\nmind that he would abandon the privilege which had hitherto been\r\nalways exercised by the head of his family, and which had been\r\nexercised more than once or twice in his own favour. But Mr. Slide,\r\nday after day, repeated his question, "We want to know whether the\r\nPrime Minister did or did not pay the election expenses of Mr. Lopez\r\nat the last Silverbridge election, and if so, why he paid them. We\r\nshall continue to ask this question till it has been answered, and\r\nwhen asking it we again say that the actual correspondence on the\r\nsubject between the Duke and Mr. Lopez is in our own hands." And\r\nthen, after a while, allusions were made to the Duchess;--for Mr.\r\nSlide had learned all the facts of the case from Lopez himself. When\r\nMr. Slide found how hard it was "to draw his badger," as he expressed\r\nhimself concerning his own operations, he at last openly alluded to\r\nthe Duchess, running the risk of any punishment that might fall upon\r\nhim by action for libel or by severe reprehension from his colleagues\r\nof the Press. "We have as yet," he said, "received no answers to\r\nthe questions which we have felt ourselves called upon to ask in\r\nreference to the conduct of the Prime Minister at the Silverbridge\r\nelection. We are of opinion that all interference by peers with the\r\nconstituencies of the country should be put down by the strong hand\r\nof the law as thoroughly and unmercifully as we are putting down\r\nordinary bribery. But when the offending peer is also the Prime\r\nMinister of this great country, it becomes doubly the duty of those\r\nwho watch over the public safety,"--Mr. Slide was always speaking\r\nof himself as watching over the public safety,--"to animadvert upon\r\nhis crime till it has been assoiled, or at any rate repented. From\r\nwhat we now hear we have reason to believe that the crime itself\r\nis acknowledged. Had the payment on behalf of Mr. Lopez not been\r\nmade,--as it certainly was made, or the letters in our hand would be\r\nimpudent forgeries,--the charge would long since have been denied.\r\nSilence in such a matter amounts to confession. But we understand\r\nthat the Duke intends to escape under the plea that he has a second\r\nself, powerful as he is to exercise the baneful influence which his\r\nterritorial wealth unfortunately gives him, but for the actions of\r\nwhich second self he, as a Peer of Parliament and as Prime Minister,\r\nis not responsible. In other words we are informed that the privilege\r\nbelonging to the Palliser family at Silverbridge was exercised, not\r\nby the Duke himself, but by the Duchess;--and that the Duke paid the\r\nmoney when he found that the Duchess had promised more than she could\r\nperform. We should hardly have thought that even a man so notoriously\r\nweak as the Duke of Omnium would have endeavoured to ride out of\r\nresponsibility by throwing the blame upon his wife; but he will\r\ncertainly find that the attempt, if made, will fail.\r\n\r\n"Against the Duchess herself we wish to say not a word. She is known\r\nas exercising a wide if not a discriminate hospitality. We believe\r\nher to be a kind-hearted, bustling, ambitious lady, to whom any\r\nlittle faults may easily be forgiven on account of her good-nature\r\nand generosity. But we cannot accept her indiscretion as an excuse\r\nfor a most unconstitutional act performed by the Prime Minister of\r\nthis country."\r\n\r\nLatterly the Duchess had taken in her own copy of the "People\'s\r\nBanner." Since she had found that those around her were endeavouring\r\nto keep from her what was being said of her husband in regard to\r\nthe borough, she had been determined to see it all. She therefore\r\nread the article from which two or three paragraphs have just been\r\ngiven,--and having read it she handed it to her friend Mrs. Finn. "I\r\nwonder that you trouble yourself with such trash," her friend said to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"That is all very well, my dear, from you; but we poor wretches who\r\nare the slaves of the people have to regard what is said of us in the\r\n\'People\'s Banner.\'"\r\n\r\n"It would be much better for you to neglect it."\r\n\r\n"Just as authors are told not to read the criticisms;--but I never\r\nwould believe any author who told me that he didn\'t read what\r\nwas said about him. I wonder when the man found out that I was\r\ngood-natured. He wouldn\'t find me good-natured if I could get hold of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"You are not going to allow it to torment you!"\r\n\r\n"For my own sake, not a moment. I fancy that if I might be permitted\r\nto have my own way I could answer him very easily. Indeed with these\r\ndregs of the newspapers, these gutter-slanderers, if one would be\r\nopen and say all the truth aloud, what would one have to fear? After\r\nall, what is it that I did? I disobeyed my husband because I thought\r\nthat he was too scrupulous. Let me say as much, out loud to the\r\npublic,--saying also that I am sorry for it, as I am,--and who would\r\nbe against me? Who would have a word to say after that? I should\r\nbe the most popular woman in England for a month,--and, as regards\r\nPlantagenet, Mr. Slide and his articles would all sink into silence.\r\nBut even though he were to continue this from day to day for a\r\ntwelvemonth it would not hurt me,--but that I know how it scorches\r\nhim. This mention of my name will make it more intolerable to him\r\nthan ever. I doubt that you know him even yet."\r\n\r\n"I thought that I did."\r\n\r\n"Though in manner he is as dry as a stick, though all his pursuits\r\nare opposite to the very idea of romance, though he passes his days\r\nand nights in thinking how he may take a halfpenny in the pound off\r\nthe taxes of the people without robbing the revenue, there is a\r\ndash of chivalry about him worthy of the old poets. To him a woman,\r\nparticularly his own woman, is a thing so fine and so precious that\r\nthe winds of heaven should hardly be allowed to blow upon her. He\r\ncannot bear to think that people should even talk of his wife. And\r\nyet, Heaven knows, poor fellow, I have given people occasion enough\r\nto talk of me. And he has a much higher chivalry than that of the old\r\npoets. They, or their heroes, watched their women because they did\r\nnot want to have trouble about them,--shut them up in castles, kept\r\nthem in ignorance, and held them as far as they could out of harm\'s\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"I hardly think they succeeded," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"But in pure selfishness they tried all they could. But he is too\r\nproud to watch. If you and I were hatching treason against him in the\r\ndark, and chance had brought him there, he would stop his ears with\r\nhis fingers. He is all trust, even when he knows that he is being\r\ndeceived. He is honour complete from head to foot. Ah, it was before\r\nyou knew me when I tried him the hardest. I never could quite tell\r\nyou that story, and I won\'t try it now; but he behaved like a god. I\r\ncould never tell him what I felt,--but I felt it."\r\n\r\n"You ought to love him."\r\n\r\n"I do;--but what\'s the use of it? He is a god, but I am not a\r\ngoddess;--and then, though he is a god, he is a dry, silent,\r\nuncongenial and uncomfortable god. It would have suited me much\r\nbetter to have married a sinner. But then the sinner that I would\r\nhave married was so irredeemable a scapegrace."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe in a woman marrying a bad man in the hope of making\r\nhim good."\r\n\r\n"Especially not when the woman is naturally inclined to evil herself.\r\nIt will half kill him when he reads all this about me. He has read it\r\nalready, and it has already half killed him. For myself I do not mind\r\nit in the least, but for his sake I mind it much. It will rob him\r\nof his only possible answer to the accusation. The very thing which\r\nthis wretch in the newspaper says he will say, and that he will be\r\ndisgraced by saying, is the very thing that he ought to say. And\r\nthere would be no disgrace in it,--beyond what I might well bear for\r\nmy little fault, and which I could bear so easily."\r\n\r\n"Shall you speak to him about it?"\r\n\r\n"No; I dare not. In this matter it has gone beyond speaking. I\r\nsuppose he does talk it over with the old Duke; but he will say\r\nnothing to me about it,--unless he were to tell me that he had\r\nresigned, and that we were to start off and live in Minorca for the\r\nnext ten years. I was so proud when they made him Prime Minister;\r\nbut I think that I am beginning to regret it now." Then there was a\r\npause, and the Duchess went on with her newspapers; but she soon\r\nresumed her discourse. Her heart was full, and out of a full heart\r\nthe mouth speaks. "They should have made me Prime Minister, and have\r\nlet him be Chancellor of the Exchequer. I begin to see the ways of\r\nGovernment now. I could have done all the dirty work. I could have\r\ngiven away garters and ribbons, and made my bargains while giving\r\nthem. I could select sleek, easy bishops who wouldn\'t be troublesome.\r\nI could give pensions or withhold them, and make the stupid men\r\npeers. I could have the big noblemen at my feet, praying to be\r\nLieutenants of Counties. I could dole out secretaryships and\r\nlordships, and never a one without getting something in return. I\r\ncould brazen out a job and let the \'People\'s Banners\' and the Slides\r\nmake their worst of it. And I think I could make myself popular with\r\nmy party, and do the high-flowing patriotic talk for the benefit of\r\nthe Provinces. A man at a regular office has to work. That\'s what\r\nPlantagenet is fit for. He wants always to be doing something that\r\nshall be really useful, and a man has to toil at that and really to\r\nknow things. But a Prime Minister should never go beyond generalities\r\nabout commerce, agriculture, peace, and general philanthropy. Of\r\ncourse he should have the gift of the gab, and that Plantagenet\r\nhasn\'t got. He never wants to say anything unless he has got\r\nsomething to say. I could do a Mansion House dinner to a marvel!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt that you could speak at all times, Lady Glen."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do so wish that I had the opportunity," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\nOf course the Duke had read the article in the privacy of his own\r\nroom, and of course the article had nearly maddened him with anger\r\nand grief. As the Duchess had said, the article had taken from him\r\nthe very ground on which his friends had told him that he could\r\nstand. He had never consented, and never would consent, to lay the\r\nblame publicly on his wife; but he had begun to think that he must\r\ntake notice of the charge made against him, and deputize some one to\r\nexplain for him in the House of Commons that the injury had been done\r\nat Silverbridge by the indiscretion of an agent who had not fulfilled\r\nhis employer\'s intentions, and that the Duke had thought it right\r\nafterwards to pay the money in consequence of this indiscretion. He\r\nhad not agreed to this, but he had brought himself to think that he\r\nmust agree to it. But now, of course, the question would follow:--Who\r\nwas the indiscreet agent? Was the Duchess the person for whose\r\nindiscretion he had had to pay L500 to Mr. Lopez? And in this matter\r\ndid he not find himself in accord even with Mr. Slide? "We should\r\nhardly have thought that even a man so notoriously weak as the Duke\r\nof Omnium would have endeavoured to ride out of responsibility by\r\nthrowing the blame upon his wife." He read and reread these words\r\ntill he knew them by heart. For a few moments it seemed to him to be\r\nan evil in the Constitution that the Prime Minister should not have\r\nthe power of instantly crucifying so foul a slanderer;--and yet it\r\nwas the very truth of the words that crushed him. He was weak,--he\r\ntold himself;--notoriously weak, it must be; and it would be most\r\nmean in him to ride out of responsibility by throwing blame upon his\r\nwife. But what else was he to do? There seemed to him to be but one\r\ncourse,--to get up in the House of Lords and declare that he paid the\r\nmoney because he had thought it right to do so under circumstances\r\nwhich he could not explain, and to declare that it was not his\r\nintention to say another word on the subject, or to have another word\r\nsaid on his behalf.\r\n\r\nThere was a Cabinet Council held that day, but no one ventured\r\nto speak to the Prime Minister as to the accusation. Though he\r\nconsidered himself to be weak, his colleagues were all more or less\r\nafraid of him. There was a certain silent dignity about the man\r\nwhich saved him from the evils, as it also debarred him from the\r\nadvantages, of familiarity. He had spoken on the subject to Mr. Monk\r\nand to Phineas Finn, and, as the reader knows, very often to his old\r\nmentor. He had also mentioned it to his friend Lord Cantrip, who was\r\nnot in the Cabinet. Coming away from the Cabinet he took Mr. Monk\'s\r\narm, and led him away to his own room in the Treasury Chambers.\r\n"Have you happened to see an article in the \'People\'s Banner\' this\r\nmorning?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I never see the \'People\'s Banner,\'" said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"There it is;--just look at that." Whereupon Mr. Monk read the\r\narticle. "You understand what people call constitutional practice as\r\nwell as any one I know. As I told you before, I did pay that man\'s\r\nexpenses. Did I do anything unconstitutional?"\r\n\r\n"That would depend, Duke, upon the circumstances. If you were to back\r\na man up by your wealth in an expensive contest, I think it would be\r\nunconstitutional. If you set yourself to work in that way, and cared\r\nnot what you spent, you might materially influence the elections, and\r\nbuy parliamentary support for yourself."\r\n\r\n"But in this case the payment was made after the man had failed, and\r\ncertainly had not been promised either by me or by any one on my\r\nbehalf."\r\n\r\n"I think it was unfortunate," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly; but I am not asking as to that," said the Duke\r\nimpatiently. "The man had been injured by indiscreet persons acting\r\non my behalf and in opposition to my wishes." He said not a word\r\nabout the Duchess; but Mr. Monk no doubt knew that her Grace had\r\nbeen at any rate one of the indiscreet persons. "He applied to\r\nme for the money, alleging that he had been injured by my agents.\r\nThat being so,--presuming that my story be correct,--did I act\r\nunconstitutionally?"\r\n\r\n"I think not," said Mr. Monk, "and I think that the circumstances,\r\nwhen explained, will bear you harmless."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; thank you. I did not want to trouble you about that just\r\nat present."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\nThe Explanation\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Monk had been altogether unable to decipher the Duke\'s purpose in\r\nthe question he had asked. About an hour afterwards they walked down\r\nto the Houses together, Mr. Monk having been kept at his office. "I\r\nhope I was not a little short with you just now," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"I did not find it out," said Mr. Monk, smiling.\r\n\r\n"You read what was in the papers, and you may imagine that it is of a\r\nnature to irritate a man. I knew that no one could answer my question\r\nso correctly as you, and therefore I was a little eager to keep\r\ndirectly to the question. It occurred to me afterwards that I had\r\nbeen--perhaps uncourteous."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, Duke."\r\n\r\n"If I was, your goodness will excuse an irritated man. If a question\r\nwere asked about this in the House of Commons, who would be the best\r\nman to answer it? Would you do it?"\r\n\r\nMr. Monk considered awhile. "I think," he said, "that Mr. Finn would\r\ndo it with a better grace. Of course I will do it if you wish it. But\r\nhe has tact in such matters, and it is known that his wife is much\r\nregarded by her Grace."\r\n\r\n"I will not have the Duchess\'s name mentioned," said the Duke,\r\nturning short upon his companion.\r\n\r\n"I did not allude to that, but I thought that the intimacy which\r\nexisted might make it pleasant to you to employ Mr. Finn as the\r\nexponent of your wishes."\r\n\r\n"I have the greatest confidence in Mr. Finn, certainly, and am on\r\nmost friendly personal terms with him. It shall be so, if I decide on\r\nanswering any question in your House on a matter so purely personal\r\nto myself."\r\n\r\n"I would suggest that you should have the question asked in a\r\nfriendly way. Get some independent member, such as Mr. Beverley\r\nor Sir James Deering, to ask it. The matter would then be brought\r\nforward in no carping spirit, and you would be enabled, through Mr.\r\nFinn, to set the matter at rest. You have probably spoken to the Duke\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"I have mentioned it to him."\r\n\r\n"Is not that what he would recommend?"\r\n\r\nThe old Duke had recommended that the entire truth should be told,\r\nand that the Duchess\'s operations should be made public. Here was our\r\npoor Prime Minister\'s great difficulty. He and his Mentor were at\r\nvariance. His Mentor was advising that the real naked truth should\r\nbe told, whereas Telemachus was intent upon keeping the name of the\r\nactual culprit in the background. "I will think it all over," said\r\nthe Prime Minister as the two parted company at Palace Yard.\r\n\r\nThat evening he spoke to Lord Cantrip on the subject. Though the\r\nmatter was so odious to him, he could not keep his mind from it for\r\na moment. Had Lord Cantrip seen the article in the "People\'s Banner"?\r\nLord Cantrip, like Mr. Monk, declared that the paper in question\r\ndid not constitute part of his usual morning\'s recreation. "I won\'t\r\nask you to read it," said the Duke;--"but it contains a very bitter\r\nattack upon me,--the bitterest that has yet been made. I suppose I\r\nought to notice the matter?"\r\n\r\n"If I were you," said Lord Cantrip, "I should put myself into the\r\nhands of the Duke of St. Bungay, and do exactly what he advises.\r\nThere is no man in England knows so well as he does what should be\r\ndone in such a case as this." The Prime Minister frowned and said\r\nnothing. "My dear Duke," continued Lord Cantrip, "I can give you no\r\nother advice. Who is there that has your personal interest and your\r\nhonour at heart so entirely as his Grace;--and what man can be a more\r\nsagacious or more experienced adviser?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking that you might ask a question about it in our House."\r\n\r\n"I?"\r\n\r\n"You would do it for me in a manner that--that would be free from all\r\noffence."\r\n\r\n"If I did it at all, I should certainly strive to do that. But it has\r\nnever occurred to me that you would make such a suggestion. Would\r\nyou give me a few moments to think about it?" "I couldn\'t do it,"\r\nLord Cantrip said afterwards. "By taking such a step, even at your\r\nrequest, I should certainly express the opinion that the matter was\r\none on which Parliament was entitled to expect that you should make\r\nan explanation. But my own opinion is that Parliament has no business\r\nto meddle in the matter. I do not think that every action of a\r\nminister\'s life should be made matter of inquiry because a newspaper\r\nmay choose to make allusions to it. At any rate, if any word is said\r\nabout it, it should, I think, be said in the other House."\r\n\r\n"The Duke of St. Bungay thinks that something should be said."\r\n\r\n"I could not myself consent even to appear to desire information on a\r\nmatter so entirely personal to yourself." The Duke bowed, and smiled\r\nwith a cold, glittering, uncomfortable smile which would sometimes\r\ncross his face when he was not pleased, and no more was then said\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to have the question asked in a far different\r\nspirit by some hostile member of the House of Commons. Sir Orlando\r\nDrought was sounded, and he for a while did give ear to the\r\nsuggestion. But, as he came to have the matter full before him, he\r\ncould not do it. The Duke had spurned his advice as a minister, and\r\nhad refused to sanction a measure which he, as the head of a branch\r\nof the Government, had proposed. The Duke had so offended him that\r\nhe conceived himself bound to regard the Duke as his enemy. But he\r\nknew,--and he could not escape from the knowledge,--that England did\r\nnot contain a more honourable man than the Duke. He was delighted\r\nthat the Duke should be vexed, and thwarted, and called ill names in\r\nthe matter. To be gratified at this discomfiture of his enemy was in\r\nthe nature of parliamentary opposition. Any blow that might weaken\r\nhis opponent was a blow in his favour. But this was a blow which\r\nhe could not strike with his own hands. There were things in\r\nparliamentary tactics which even Sir Orlando could not do. Arthur\r\nFletcher was also asked to undertake the task. He was the successful\r\ncandidate, the man who had opposed Lopez, and who was declared in\r\nthe "People\'s Banner" to have emancipated that borough by his noble\r\nconduct from the tyranny of the House of Palliser. And it was thought\r\nthat he might like an opportunity of making himself known in the\r\nHouse. But he was simply indignant when the suggestion was made\r\nto him. "What is it to me," he said, "who paid the blackguard\'s\r\nexpenses?"\r\n\r\nThis went on for some weeks after Parliament had met, and for some\r\ndays even after the article in which direct allusion was made to\r\nthe Duchess. The Prime Minister could not be got to consent that no\r\nnotice should be taken of the matter, let the papers or the public\r\nsay what they would, nor could he be induced to let the matter be\r\nhandled in the manner proposed by the elder Duke. And during this\r\ntime he was in such a fever that those about him felt that something\r\nmust be done. Mr. Monk suggested that if everybody held his\r\ntongue,--meaning all the Duke\'s friends,--the thing would wear itself\r\nout. But it was apparent to those who were nearest to the minister,\r\nto Mr. Warburton, for instance, and the Duke of St. Bungay, that the\r\nman himself would be worn out first. The happy possessor of a thick\r\nskin can hardly understand how one not so blessed may be hurt by\r\nthe thong of a little whip! At last the matter was arranged. At the\r\ninstigation of Mr. Monk, Sir James Deering, who was really the father\r\nof the House, an independent member, but one who generally voted with\r\nthe Coalition, consented to ask the question in the House of Commons.\r\nAnd Phineas Finn was instructed by the Duke as to the answer that was\r\nto be given. The Duke of Omnium in giving these instructions made a\r\nmystery of the matter which he by no means himself intended. But he\r\nwas so sore that he could not be simple in what he said. "Mr. Finn,"\r\nhe said, "you must promise me this,--that the name of the Duchess\r\nshall not be mentioned."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not by me, if you tell me that I am not to mention it."\r\n\r\n"No one else can do so. The matter will take the form of a simple\r\nquestion, and though the conduct of a minister may no doubt be made\r\nthe subject of debate,--and it is not improbable that my conduct may\r\ndo so in this instance,--it is, I think, impossible that any member\r\nshould make an allusion to my wife. The privilege or power of\r\nreturning a member for the borough has undoubtedly been exercised by\r\nour family since as well as previous to both the Reform Bills. At\r\nthe last election I thought it right to abandon that privilege, and\r\nnotified to those about me my intention. But that which a man has\r\nthe power of doing he cannot always do without the interference\r\nof those around him. There was a misconception, and among my,--my\r\nadherents,--there were some who injudiciously advised Mr. Lopez\r\nto stand on my interest. But he did not get my interest, and was\r\nbeaten;--and therefore when he asked me for the money which he\r\nhad spent, I paid it to him. That is all. I think the House can\r\nhardly avoid to see that my effort was made to discontinue an\r\nunconstitutional proceeding."\r\n\r\nSir James Deering asked the question. "He trusted," he said, "that\r\nthe House would not think that the question of which he had given\r\nnotice and which he was about to ask was instigated by any personal\r\ndesire on his part to inquire into the conduct of the Prime Minister.\r\nHe was one who believed that the Duke of Omnium was as little likely\r\nas any man in England to offend by unconstitutional practice on\r\nhis own part. But a great deal had been talked and written lately\r\nabout the late election at Silverbridge, and there were those who\r\nthought,--and he was one of them,--that something should be said to\r\nstop the mouths of cavillers. With this object he would ask the Right\r\nHonourable Gentleman who led the House, and who was perhaps first in\r\nstanding among the noble Duke\'s colleagues in that House, whether the\r\nnoble Duke was prepared to have any statement on the subject made."\r\n\r\nThe House was full to the very corners of the galleries. Of course it\r\nwas known to everybody that the question was to be asked and to be\r\nanswered. There were some who thought that the matter was so serious\r\nthat the Prime Minister could not get over it. Others had heard in\r\nthe clubs that Lady Glen, as the Duchess was still called, was to be\r\nmade the scapegoat. Men of all classes were open-mouthed in their\r\ndenunciation of the meanness of Lopez,--though no one but Mr. Wharton\r\nknew half his villainy, as he alone knew that the expenses had been\r\npaid twice over. In one corner of the reporters\' gallery sat Mr.\r\nSlide, pencil in hand, prepared to revert to his old work on so\r\nmomentous an occasion. It was a great day for him. He by his own\r\nunassisted energy had brought a Prime Minister to book, and had\r\ncreated all this turmoil. It might be his happy lot to be the means\r\nof turning that Prime Minister out of office. It was he who had\r\nwatched over the nation! The Duchess had been most anxious to be\r\npresent,--but had not ventured to come without asking her husband\'s\r\nleave, which he had most peremptorily refused to give. "I cannot\r\nunderstand, Glencora, how you can suggest such a thing," he had said.\r\n\r\n"You make so much of everything," she had replied petulantly; but she\r\nhad remained at home. The ladies\' gallery was, however, quite full.\r\nMrs. Finn was there, of course, anxious not only for her friend,\r\nbut eager to hear how her husband would acquit himself in his task.\r\nThe wives and daughters of all the ministers were there,--excepting\r\nthe wife of the Prime Minister. There never had been, in the memory\r\nof them all, a matter that was so interesting to them, for it was\r\nthe only matter they remembered in which a woman\'s conduct might\r\nprobably be called in question in the House of Commons. And the seats\r\nappropriated to peers were so crammed that above a dozen grey-headed\r\nold lords were standing in the passage which divides them from the\r\ncommon strangers. After all it was not, in truth, much of an affair.\r\nA very little man indeed had calumniated the conduct of a minister\r\nof the Crown, till it had been thought well that the minister should\r\ndefend himself. No one really believed that the Duke had committed\r\nany great offence. At the worst it was no more than indiscretion,\r\nwhich was noticeable only because a Prime Minister should never be\r\nindiscreet. Had the taxation of the whole country for the next year\r\nbeen in dispute, there would have been no such interest felt. Had the\r\nwelfare of the Indian Empire occupied the House, the House would have\r\nbeen empty. But the hope that a certain woman\'s name would have to be\r\nmentioned, crammed it from the floor to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe reader need not be told that that name was not mentioned. Our old\r\nfriend Phineas, on rising to his legs, first apologised for doing so\r\nin place of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. But perhaps the House\r\nwould accept a statement from him, as the noble Duke at the head of\r\nthe Government had asked him to make it. Then he made his statement.\r\n"Perhaps," he said, "no falser accusation than this had ever been\r\nbrought forward against a minister of the Crown, for it specially\r\ncharged his noble friend with resorting to the employment of\r\nunconstitutional practices to bolster up his parliamentary support,\r\nwhereas it was known by everybody that there would have been no\r\nmatter for accusation at all had not the Duke of his own motion\r\nabandoned a recognised privilege, because, in his opinion, the\r\nexercise of that privilege was opposed to the spirit of the\r\nConstitution. Had the noble Duke simply nominated a candidate, as\r\ncandidates had been nominated at Silverbridge for centuries past,\r\nthat candidate would have been returned with absolute certainty,\r\nand there would have been no word spoken on the subject. It was not,\r\nperhaps, for him, who had the honour of serving under his Grace, and\r\nwho, as being a part of his Grace\'s Government, was for the time\r\none with his Grace, to expatiate at length on the nobility of the\r\nsacrifice here made. But they all knew there at what rate was valued\r\na seat in that House. Thank God that privilege could not now be\r\nrated at any money price. It could not be bought and sold. But this\r\nprivilege which his noble friend had so magnanimously resigned from\r\npurely patriotic motives, was, he believed, still in existence, and\r\nhe would ask those few who were still in the happy, or, perhaps, he\r\nhad better say in the envied, position of being able to send their\r\nfriends to that House, what was their estimation of the conduct of\r\nthe Duke in this matter? It might be that there were one or two such\r\npresent, and who now heard him,--or, perhaps, one or two who owed\r\ntheir seats to the exercise of such a privilege. They might marvel at\r\nthe magnitude of the surrender. They might even question the sagacity\r\nof the man who could abandon so much without a price. But he hardly\r\nthought that even they would regard it as unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n"This was what the Prime Minister had done,--acting not as Prime\r\nMinister, but as an English nobleman, in the management of his own\r\nproperty and privileges. And now he would come to the gist of the\r\naccusation made; in making which, the thing which the Duke had really\r\ndone had been altogether ignored. When the vacancy had been declared\r\nby the acceptance of the Chiltern Hundreds by a gentleman whose\r\nabsence from the House they all regretted, the Duke had signified to\r\nhis agents his intention of retiring altogether from the exercise of\r\nany privilege or power in the matter. But the Duke was then, as he\r\nwas also now, and would, it was to be hoped, long continue to be,\r\nPrime Minister of England. He need hardly remind gentlemen in that\r\nHouse that the Prime Minister was not in a position to devote his\r\nundivided time to the management of his own property, or even to the\r\ninterests of the Borough of Silverbridge. That his Grace had been\r\nearnest in his instructions to his agents, the sequel fully proved;\r\nbut that earnestness his agents had misinterpreted."\r\n\r\nThen there was heard a voice in the House, "What agents?" and from\r\nanother voice, "Name them." For there were present some who thought\r\nit to be shameful that the excitement of the occasion should be\r\nlowered by keeping back all allusion to the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"I have not distinguished," said Phineas, assuming an indignant tone,\r\n"the honourable gentlemen from whom those questions have come, and\r\ntherefore I have the less compunction in telling them that it is no\r\npart of my duty on this occasion to gratify a morbid and an indecent\r\ncuriosity." Then there was a cry of "Order," and an appeal to the\r\nSpeaker. Certain gentlemen wished to know whether indecent was\r\nparliamentary. The Speaker, with some hesitation, expressed his\r\nopinion that the word, as then used, was not open to objection from\r\nhim. He thought that it was within the scope of a member\'s rights to\r\ncharge another member with indecent curiosity. "If," said Phineas,\r\nrising again to his legs, for he had sat down for a moment, "the\r\ngentleman who called for a name will rise in his place and repeat the\r\ndemand, I will recall the word indecent and substitute another,--or\r\nothers. I will tell him that he is one who, regardless of the real\r\nconduct of the Prime Minister, either as a man or as a servant of\r\nthe Crown, is only anxious to inflict an unmanly wound in order that\r\nhe may be gratified by seeing the pain which he inflicts." Then\r\nhe paused, but as no further question was asked, he continued his\r\nstatement. "A candidate had been brought forward," he said, "by those\r\ninterested in the Duke\'s affairs. A man whom he would not name, but\r\nwho, he trusted, would never succeed in his ambition to occupy a seat\r\nin that House, had been brought forward, and certain tradesmen in\r\nSilverbridge had been asked to support him as the Duke\'s nominee.\r\nThere was no doubt about it. The House perhaps could understand that\r\nthe local adherents and neighbours of a man so high in rank and\r\nwealth as the Duke of Omnium would not gladly see the privileges\r\nof their lord diminished. Perhaps, too, it occurred to them that a\r\nPrime Minister could not have his eye everywhere. There would always\r\nbe worthy men in boroughs who liked to exercise some second-hand\r\nauthority. At any rate it was the case that this candidate was\r\nencouraged. Then the Duke had heard it, and had put his foot upon\r\nthe little mutiny, and had stamped it out at once. He might perhaps\r\nhere," he said, "congratulate the House on the acquisition it had\r\nreceived by the failure of that candidate. So far, at any rate,"\r\nhe thought, "it must be admitted that the Duke had been free from\r\nblame;--but now he came to the gravamen of the charge." The gravamen\r\nof the charge is so well known to the reader that the simple account\r\nwhich Phineas gave of it need not be repeated. The Duke had paid\r\nthe money, when asked for it, because he felt that the man had been\r\ninjured by incorrect representations made to him. "I need hardly\r\npause to stigmatise the meanness of that application," said Phineas,\r\n"but I may perhaps conclude by saying that whether the last act\r\ndone by the Duke in this matter was or was not indiscreet, I shall\r\nprobably have the House with me when I say that it savours much more\r\nstrongly of nobility than of indiscretion."\r\n\r\nWhen Phineas Finn sat down no one arose to say another word on the\r\nsubject. It was afterwards felt that it would only have been graceful\r\nhad Sir Orlando risen and expressed his opinion that the House had\r\nheard the statement just made with perfect satisfaction. But he did\r\nnot do so, and after a short pause the ordinary business of the day\r\nwas recommenced. Then there was a speedy descent from the galleries,\r\nand the ladies trooped out of their cage, and the grey-headed old\r\npeers went back to their own chamber, and the members themselves\r\nquickly jostled out through the doors, and Mr. Monk was left to\r\nexplain his proposed alteration in the dog tax to a thin House of\r\nseventy or eighty members.\r\n\r\nThe thing was then over, and people were astonished that so great\r\na thing should be over with so little fuss. It really seemed that\r\nafter Phineas Finn\'s speech there was nothing more to be said on the\r\nmatter. Everybody of course knew that the Duchess had been the chief\r\nof the agents to whom he had alluded, but they had known as much as\r\nthat before. It was, however, felt by everybody that the matter had\r\nbeen brought to an end. The game, such as it was, had been played\r\nout. Perhaps the only person who heard Mr. Finn\'s speech throughout,\r\nand still hoped that the spark could be again fanned into a flame,\r\nwas Quintus Slide. He went out and wrote another article about the\r\nDuchess. If a man was so unable to rule his affairs at home, he was\r\ncertainly unfit to be Prime Minister. But even Quintus Slide, as\r\nhe wrote his article, felt that he was hoping against hope. The\r\ncharge might be referred to hereafter as one that had never been\r\nsatisfactorily cleared up. That game is always open to the opponents\r\nof a minister. After the lapse of a few months an old accusation can\r\nbe serviceably used, whether at the time it was proved or disproved.\r\nMr. Slide published his article, but he felt that for the present\r\nthe Silverbridge election papers had better be put by among the\r\nproperties of the "People\'s Banner," and brought out, if necessary,\r\nfor further use at some future time.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Finn," said the Duke, "I feel indebted to you for the trouble\r\nyou have taken."\r\n\r\n"It was only a pleasant duty."\r\n\r\n"I am grateful to you for the manner in which it was performed." This\r\nwas all the Duke said, and Phineas felt it to be cold. The Duke, in\r\ntruth, was grateful; but gratitude with him always failed to exhibit\r\nitself readily. From the world at large Phineas Finn received great\r\npraise for the manner in which he had performed his task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\n"Quite Settled"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abuse which was now publicly heaped on the name of Ferdinand\r\nLopez hit the man very hard; but not so hard perhaps as his rejection\r\nby Lady Eustace. That was an episode in his life of which even he\r\nfelt ashamed, and of which he was unable to shake the disgrace from\r\nhis memory. He had no inner appreciation whatsoever of what was\r\nreally good or what was really bad in a man\'s conduct. He did not\r\nknow that he had done evil in applying to the Duke for the money. He\r\nhad only meant to attack the Duke; and when the money had come it\r\nhad been regarded as justifiable prey. And when after receiving the\r\nDuke\'s money, he had kept also Mr. Wharton\'s money, he had justified\r\nhimself again by reminding himself that Mr. Wharton certainly\r\nowed him much more than that. In a sense he was what is called a\r\ngentleman. He knew how to speak, and how to look, how to use a knife\r\nand fork, how to dress himself, and how to walk. But he had not the\r\nfaintest notion of the feelings of a gentleman. He had, however, a\r\nvery keen conception of the evil of being generally ill spoken of.\r\nEven now, though he was making up his mind to leave England for a\r\nlong term of years, he understood the disadvantage of leaving it\r\nunder so heavy a cloud;--and he understood also that the cloud might\r\npossibly impede his going altogether. Even in Coleman Street they\r\nwere looking black upon him, and Mr. Hartlepod went so far as to say\r\nto Lopez himself, that, "by Jove, he had put his foot in it." He had\r\nendeavoured to be courageous under his burden, and every day walked\r\ninto the offices of the Mining Company, endeavouring to look as\r\nthough he had committed no fault of which he had to be ashamed. But\r\nafter the second day he found that nothing was said to him of the\r\naffairs of the Company, and on the fourth day Mr. Hartlepod informed\r\nhim that the time allowed for paying up his shares had passed by, and\r\nthat another local manager would be appointed. "The time is not over\r\ntill to-morrow," said Lopez angrily. "I tell you what I am told to\r\ntell you," said Mr. Hartlepod. "You will only waste your time by\r\ncoming here any more."\r\n\r\nHe had not once seen Mr. Wharton since the statement made in\r\nParliament, although he had lived in the same house with him. Everett\r\nWharton had come home, and they two had met;--but the meeting had\r\nbeen stormy. "It seems to me, Lopez, that you are a scoundrel,"\r\nEverett said to him one day after having heard the whole story,--or\r\nrather many stories,--from his father. This took place not in\r\nManchester Square, but at the club, where Everett had endeavoured to\r\ncut his brother-in-law. It need hardly be said that at this time\r\nLopez was not popular at his club. On the next day a meeting of the\r\nwhole club was to be held that the propriety of expelling him might\r\nbe discussed. But he had resolved that he would not be cowed, that he\r\nwould still show himself, and still defend his conduct. He did not\r\nknow, however, that Everett Wharton had already made known to the\r\nCommittee of the club all the facts of the double payment.\r\n\r\nHe had addressed Everett in that solicitude to which a man should\r\nnever be reduced of seeking to be recognised by at any rate one\r\nacquaintance,--and now his brother-in-law had called him a scoundrel\r\nin the presence of other men. He raised his arm as though to use the\r\ncane in his hands, but he was cowed by the feeling that all there\r\nwere his adversaries. "How dare you use that language to me!" he said\r\nvery weakly.\r\n\r\n"It is the language that I must use if you speak to me."\r\n\r\n"I am your brother-in-law, and that restrains me."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately you are."\r\n\r\n"And am living in your father\'s house."\r\n\r\n"That, again, is a misfortune which it appears difficult to remedy.\r\nYou have been told to go, and you won\'t go."\r\n\r\n"Your ingratitude, sir, is marvellous! Who saved your life when\r\nyou were attacked in the park, and were too drunk to take care of\r\nyourself? Who has stood your friend with your close-fisted old father\r\nwhen you have lost money at play that you could not pay? But you\r\nare one of those who would turn away from any benefactor in his\r\nmisfortune."\r\n\r\n"I must certainly turn away from a man who has disgraced himself as\r\nyou have done," said Everett, leaving the room. Lopez threw himself\r\ninto an easy-chair, and rang the bell loudly for a cup of coffee, and\r\nlit a cigar. He had not been turned out of the club as yet, and the\r\nservant at any rate was bound to attend to him.\r\n\r\nThat night he waited up for his father-in-law in Manchester Square.\r\nHe would certainly go to Guatemala now,--if it were not too late. He\r\nwould go though he were forced to leave his wife behind him, and thus\r\nsurrender any further hope for money from Mr. Wharton beyond the sum\r\nwhich he would receive as the price of his banishment. It was true\r\nthat the fortnight allowed to him by the Company was only at an end\r\nthat day, and that, therefore, the following morning might be taken\r\nas the last day named for the payment of the money. No doubt, also,\r\nMr. Wharton\'s bill at a few days\' date would be accepted if that\r\ngentleman could not at the moment give a cheque for so large a sum as\r\nwas required. And the appointment had been distinctly promised to him\r\nwith no other stipulation than that the money required for the shares\r\nshould be paid. He did not believe in Mr. Hartlepod\'s threat. It was\r\nimpossible, he thought, that he should be treated in so infamous\r\na manner merely because he had had his election expenses repaid\r\nhim by the Duke of Omnium! He would, therefore, ask for the money,\r\nand--renounce the society of his wife.\r\n\r\nAs he made this resolve something like real love returned to his\r\nheart, and he became for a while sick with regret. He assured himself\r\nthat he had loved her, and that he could love her still;--but why had\r\nshe not been true to him? Why had she clung to her father instead of\r\nclinging to her husband? Why had she not learned his ways,--as a wife\r\nis bound to learn the ways of the man she marries? Why had she not\r\nhelped him in his devices, fallen into his plans, been regardful of\r\nhis fortunes, and made herself one with him? There had been present\r\nto him at times an idea that if he could take her away with him to\r\nthat distant country to which he thought to go, and thus remove her\r\nfrom the upas influence of her father\'s roof-tree, she would then\r\nfall into his views and become his wife indeed. Then he would again\r\nbe tender to her, again love her, again endeavour to make the world\r\nsoft to her. But it was too late now for that. He had failed in\r\neverything as far as England was concerned, and it was chiefly by her\r\nfault that he had failed. He would consent to leave her;--but, as he\r\nthought of it in his solitude, his eyes became moist with regret.\r\n\r\nIn these days Mr. Wharton never came home till about midnight, and\r\nthen passed rapidly through the hall to his own room,--and in the\r\nmorning had his breakfast brought to him in the same room, so that he\r\nmight not even see his son-in-law. His daughter would go to him when\r\nat breakfast, and there, together for some half-hour, they would\r\nendeavour to look forward to their future fate. But hitherto they had\r\nnever been able to look forward in accord, as she still persisted in\r\ndeclaring that if her husband bade her to go with him,--she would\r\ngo. On this night Lopez sat up in the dining-room, and as soon as he\r\nheard Mr. Wharton\'s key in the door, he placed himself in the hall.\r\n"I wish to speak to you to-night, sir," he said. "Would you object to\r\ncome in for a few moments?" Then Mr. Wharton followed him into the\r\nroom. "As we live now," continued Lopez, "I have not much opportunity\r\nof speaking to you, even on business."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir; you can speak now,--if you have anything to say."\r\n\r\n"The L5000 you promised me must be paid to-morrow. It is the last\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"I promised it only on certain conditions. Had you complied with them\r\nthe money would have been paid before this."\r\n\r\n"Just so. The conditions are very hard, Mr. Wharton. It surprises me\r\nthat such a one as you should think it right to separate a husband\r\nfrom his wife."\r\n\r\n"I think it right, sir, to separate my daughter from such a one as\r\nyou are. I thought so before, but I think so doubly now. If I can\r\nsecure your absence in Guatemala by the payment of this money, and if\r\nyou will give me a document that shall be prepared by Mr. Walker and\r\nsigned by yourself, assuring your wife that you will not hereafter\r\ncall upon her to live with you, the money shall be paid."\r\n\r\n"All that will take time, Mr. Wharton."\r\n\r\n"I will not pay a penny without it. I can meet you at the office in\r\nColeman Street to-morrow, and doubtless they will accept my written\r\nassurance to pay the money as soon as those stipulations shall be\r\ncomplied with."\r\n\r\n"That would disgrace me in the office, Mr. Wharton."\r\n\r\n"And are you not disgraced there already? Can you tell me that they\r\nhave not heard of your conduct in Coleman Street, or that hearing it\r\nthey disregard it?" His son-in-law stood frowning at him, but did not\r\nat the moment say a word. "Nevertheless, I will meet you there if\r\nyou please, at any time that you may name, and if they do not object\r\nto employ such a man as their manager, I shall not object on their\r\nbehalf."\r\n\r\n"To the last you are hard and cruel to me," said Lopez;--"but I will\r\nmeet you in Coleman Street at eleven to-morrow." Then Mr. Wharton\r\nleft the room, and Lopez was there alone amidst the gloom of the\r\nheavy curtains and the dark paper. A London dining-room at night is\r\nalways dark, cavernous, and unlovely. The very pictures on the walls\r\nlack brightness, and the furniture is black and heavy. This room was\r\nlarge, but old-fashioned and very dark. Here Lopez walked up and down\r\nafter Mr. Wharton had left him, trying to think how far Fate and how\r\nfar he himself were responsible for his present misfortunes. No doubt\r\nhe had begun the world well. His father had been little better than a\r\ntravelling pedlar, but had made some money by selling jewellery, and\r\nhad educated his son. Lopez could on no score impute blame to his\r\nfather for what had happened to him. And, when he thought of the\r\nmeans at his disposal in his early youth, he felt that he had a right\r\nto boast of some success. He had worked hard, and had won his way\r\nupwards, and had almost lodged himself securely among those people\r\nwith whom it had been his ambition to live. Early in life he had\r\nfound himself among those who were called gentlemen and ladies. He\r\nhad been able to assume their manners, and had lived with them on\r\nequal terms. When thinking of his past life he never forgot to remind\r\nhimself that he had been a guest at the house of the Duke of Omnium!\r\nAnd yet how was it with him now? He was penniless. He was rejected by\r\nhis father-in-law. He was feared, and, as he thought, detested by his\r\nwife. He was expelled from his club. He was cut by his old friends.\r\nAnd he had been told very plainly by the Secretary in Coleman Street\r\nthat his presence there was no longer desired. What should he do\r\nwith himself if Mr. Wharton\'s money were now refused, and if the\r\nappointment in Guatemala were denied to him? And then he thought of\r\npoor Sexty Parker and his family. He was not naturally an ill-natured\r\nman. Though he could upbraid his wife for alluding to Mrs. Parker\'s\r\nmisery, declaring that Mrs. Parker must take the rubs of the world\r\njust as others took them, still the misfortunes which he had brought\r\non her and on her children did add something to the weight of his own\r\nmisfortunes. If he could not go to Guatemala, what should he do with\r\nhimself;--where should he go? Thus he walked up and down the room for\r\nan hour. Would not a pistol or a razor give him the best solution for\r\nall his difficulties?\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he kept his appointment at the office in\r\nColeman Street, as did Mr. Wharton also. The latter was there first\r\nby some minutes, and explained to Mr. Hartlepod that he had come\r\nthere to meet his son-in-law. Mr. Hartlepod was civil, but very cold.\r\nMr. Wharton saw at the first glance that the services of Ferdinand\r\nLopez were no longer in request by the San Juan Mining Company;\r\nbut he sat down and waited. Now that he was there, however painful\r\nthe interview would be, he would go through it. At ten minutes\r\npast eleven he made up his mind that he would wait till the\r\nhalf-hour,--and then go, with the fixed resolution that he would\r\nnever willingly spend another shilling on behalf of that wretched\r\nman. But at a quarter past eleven the wretched man came,--swaggering\r\ninto the office, though it had not, hitherto, been his custom to\r\nswagger. But misfortune masters all but the great men, and upsets the\r\nbest-learned lesson of even a long life. "I hope I have not kept you\r\nwaiting, Mr. Wharton. Well, Hartlepod, how are you to-day? So this\r\nlittle affair is to be settled at last, and now these shares shall be\r\nbought and paid for." Mr. Wharton did not say a word, not even rising\r\nfrom his chair, or greeting his son-in-law by a word. "I dare say Mr.\r\nWharton has already explained himself," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that there is any necessity," said Mr. Hartlepod.\r\n\r\n"Well,--I suppose it\'s simple enough," continued Lopez. "Mr. Wharton,\r\nI believe I am right in saying that you are ready to pay the money at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I am ready to pay the money as soon as I am assured that you\r\nare on your route to Guatemala. I will not pay a penny till I know\r\nthat as a fact."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Hartlepod rose from his seat and spoke. "Gentlemen," he\r\nsaid, "the matter within the last few days has assumed a different\r\ncomplexion."\r\n\r\n"As how?" exclaimed Lopez.\r\n\r\n"The Directors have changed their mind as to sending out Mr. Lopez\r\nas their local manager. The Directors intend to appoint another\r\ngentleman. I had already acquainted Mr. Lopez with the Directors\'\r\nintention."\r\n\r\n"Then the matter is settled?" said Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"Quite settled," said Mr. Hartlepod.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course Lopez began to fume and to be furious.\r\nWhat!--after all that had been done did the Directors mean to go back\r\nfrom their word? After he had been induced to abandon his business in\r\nhis own country, was he to be thrown over in that way? If the Company\r\nintended to treat him like that, the Company would very soon hear\r\nfrom him. Thank God there were laws in the land. "Yesterday was the\r\nlast day fixed for the payment of the money," said Mr. Hartlepod.\r\n\r\n"It is at any rate certain that Mr. Lopez is not to go to Guatemala?"\r\nasked Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n"Quite certain," said Mr. Hartlepod. Then Mr. Wharton rose from his\r\nchair and quitted the room.\r\n\r\n"By G----, you have ruined me among you," said Lopez;--"ruined me\r\nin the most shameful manner. There is no mercy, no friendship, no\r\nkindness, no forbearance anywhere! Why am I to be treated in this\r\nmanner?"\r\n\r\n"If you have any complaint to make," said Mr. Hartlepod, "you had\r\nbetter write to the Directors. I have nothing to do but my duty."\r\n\r\n"By heavens, the Directors shall hear of it!" said Lopez as he left\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\nMr. Wharton went to his chambers and endeavoured to make up his mind\r\nwhat step he must now take in reference to this dreadful incubus.\r\nOf course he could turn the man out of his house, but in so doing\r\nit might well be that he would also turn out his own daughter. He\r\nbelieved Lopez to be utterly without means, and a man so destitute\r\nwould generally be glad to be relieved from the burden of his wife\'s\r\nsupport. But this man would care nothing for his wife\'s comfort;\r\nnothing even, as Mr. Wharton believed, for his wife\'s life. He would\r\nsimply use his wife as best he might as a means for obtaining money.\r\nThere was nothing to be done but to buy him off, by so much money\r\ndown, and by so much at stated intervals as long as he should keep\r\naway. Mr. Walker must manage it, but it was quite clear to Mr.\r\nWharton that the Guatemala scheme was altogether at an end. In\r\nthe meantime a certain sum must be offered to the man at once, on\r\ncondition that he would leave the house and do so without taking his\r\nwife with him.\r\n\r\nSo far Mr. Wharton had a plan, and a plan that was at least feasible.\r\nWretched as he was, miserable, as he thought of the fate which had\r\nbefallen his daughter,--there was still a prospect of some relief.\r\nBut Lopez as he walked out of the office had nothing to which he\r\ncould look for comfort. He slowly made his way to Little Tankard\r\nYard, and there he found Sexty Parker balancing himself on the back\r\nlegs of his chair, with a small decanter of public-house sherry\r\nbefore him. "What; you here?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I have come to say good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Where are you going then? You shan\'t start to Guatemala if I know\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all over, my boy," said Lopez, smiling.\r\n\r\n"What is it you mean?" said Sexty, sitting square on his chair and\r\nlooking very serious.\r\n\r\n"I am not going to Guatemala or anywhere else. I thought I\'d just\r\nlook in to tell you that I\'m just done for,--that I haven\'t a hope\r\nof a shilling now or hereafter. You told me the other day that I was\r\nafraid to come here. You see that as soon as anything is fixed, I\r\ncome and tell you everything at once."\r\n\r\n"What is fixed?"\r\n\r\n"That I am ruined. That there isn\'t a penny to come from any source."\r\n\r\n"Wharton has got money," said Sexty.\r\n\r\n"And there is money in the Bank of England,--but I cannot get at it."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do, Lopez?"\r\n\r\n"Ah; that\'s the question. What am I going to do? I can say nothing\r\nabout that, but I can say, Sexty, that our affairs are at an end. I\'m\r\nvery sorry for it, old boy. We ought to have made fortunes, but we\r\ndidn\'t. As far as the work went, I did my best. Good-bye, old fellow.\r\nYou\'ll do well some of these days yet, I don\'t doubt. Don\'t teach the\r\nbairns to curse me. As for Mrs. P. I have no hope there, I know."\r\nThen he went, leaving Sexty Parker quite aghast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\n"The First and the Last"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wharton was in Coleman Street, having his final interview\r\nwith Mr. Hartlepod, there came a visitor to Mrs. Lopez in Manchester\r\nSquare. Up to this date there had been great doubt with Mr. Wharton\r\nwhether at last the banishment to Guatemala would become a fact. From\r\nday to day his mind had changed. It had been an infinite benefit that\r\nLopez should go, if he could be got to go alone, but as great an evil\r\nif at last he should take his wife with him. But the father had never\r\ndared to express these doubts to her, and she had taught herself\r\nto think that absolute banishment with a man whom she certainly no\r\nlonger loved, was the punishment she had to pay for the evil she had\r\ndone. It was now March, and the second or third of April had been\r\nfixed for her departure. Of course, she had endeavoured from time to\r\ntime to learn all that was to be learned from her husband. Sometimes\r\nhe would be almost communicative to her; at other times she could get\r\nhardly a word from him. But, through it all, he gave her to believe\r\nthat she would have to go. Nor did her father make any great effort\r\nto turn his mind the other way. If it must be so, of what use would\r\nbe such false kindness on his part? She had therefore gone to work to\r\nmake her purchases, studying that economy which must henceforth be\r\nthe great duty of her life, and reminding herself as to everything\r\nshe bought that it would have to be worn with tears and used in\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd then she sent a message to Arthur Fletcher. It so happened that\r\nSir Alured Wharton was up in London at this time with his daughter\r\nMary. Sir Alured did not come to Manchester Square. There was nothing\r\nthat the old baronet could say in the midst of all this misery,--no\r\ncomfort that he could give. It was well-known now to all the Whartons\r\nand all the Fletchers that this Lopez, who had married her who was\r\nto have been the pearl of the two families, had proved himself to\r\nbe a scoundrel. The two old Whartons met no doubt at some club, or\r\nperhaps in Stone Buildings, and spoke some few bitter words to each\r\nother; but Sir Alured did not see the unfortunate young woman who\r\nhad disgraced herself by so wretched a marriage. But Mary came, and\r\nby her a message was sent to Arthur Fletcher. "Tell him that I am\r\ngoing," said Emily. "Tell him not to come; but give him my love. He\r\nwas always one of my kindest friends."\r\n\r\n"Why,--why,--why did you not take him?" said Mary, moved by the\r\nexcitement of the moment to suggestions which were quite at variance\r\nwith the fixed propriety of her general ideas.\r\n\r\n"Why should you speak of that?" said the other. "I never speak of\r\nhim,--never think of him. But, if you see him, tell him what I say."\r\nArthur Fletcher was of course in the Square on the following day,--on\r\nthat very day on which Mr. Wharton learned that, whatever might\r\nbe his daughter\'s fate, she would not, at any rate, be taken to\r\nGuatemala. They two had never met since the day on which they\r\nhad been brought together for a moment at the Duchess\'s party at\r\nRichmond. It had of course been understood by both of them that they\r\nwere not to be allowed to see each other. Her husband had made a\r\npretext of an act of friendship on his part to establish a quarrel,\r\nand both of them had been bound by that quarrel. When a husband\r\ndeclares that his wife shall not know a man, that edict must be\r\nobeyed,--or, if disobeyed, must be subverted by intrigue. In this\r\ncase there had been no inclination to intrigue on either side. The\r\norder had been obeyed, and as far as the wife was concerned, had been\r\nonly a small part of the terrible punishment which had come upon her\r\nas the result of her marriage. But now, when Arthur Fletcher sent up\r\nhis name, she did not hesitate as to seeing him. No doubt she had\r\nthought it probable that she might see him when she gave her message\r\nto her cousin.\r\n\r\n"I could not let you go without coming to you," he said.\r\n\r\n"It is very good of you. Yes;--I suppose we are going. Guatemala\r\nsounds a long way off, Arthur, does it not? But they tell me it\r\nis a beautiful country." She spoke with a cheerful voice, almost\r\nas though she liked the idea of her journey; but he looked at her\r\nwith beseeching, anxious, sorrow-laden eyes. "After all, what is a\r\njourney of a few weeks? Why should I not be as happy in Guatemala\r\nas in London? As to friends, I do not know that it will make much\r\ndifference,--except papa."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me to make a difference," said he.\r\n\r\n"I never see anybody now,--neither your people, nor the Wharton\r\nWhartons. Indeed, I see nobody. If it were not for papa I should be\r\nglad to go. I am told that it is a charming country. I have not found\r\nManchester Square very charming. I am inclined to think that all the\r\nworld is very much alike, and that it does not matter very much where\r\none lives,--or, perhaps, what one does. But at any rate I am going,\r\nand I am very glad to be able to say good-bye to you before I start."\r\nAll this she said rapidly, in a manner unlike herself. She was\r\nforcing herself to speak so that she might save herself, if possible,\r\nfrom breaking down in his presence.\r\n\r\n"Of course I came when Mary told me."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--she was here. Sir Alured did not come. I don\'t wonder at that,\r\nhowever. And your mother was in town some time ago,--but I didn\'t\r\nexpect her to come. Why should they come? I don\'t know whether you\r\nmight not have better stayed away. Of course I am a Pariah now; but\r\nPariah as I am, I shall be as good as any one else in Guatemala. You\r\nhave seen Everett since he has been in town, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I have seen him."\r\n\r\n"I hope they won\'t quarrel with Everett because of what I have done.\r\nI have felt that more than all,--that both papa and he have suffered\r\nbecause of it. Do you know, I think people are hard. They might have\r\nthrown me off without being unkind to them. It is that that has\r\nkilled me, Arthur;--that they should have suffered." He sat looking\r\nat her, not knowing how to interrupt her, or what to say. There was\r\nmuch that he meant to say, but he did not know how to begin it, or\r\nhow to frame his words. "When I am gone, perhaps, it will be all\r\nright," she continued. "When he told me that I was to go, that was my\r\ncomfort. I think I have taught myself to think nothing of myself, to\r\nbear it all as a necessity, to put up with it, whatever it may be, as\r\nmen bear thirst in the desert. Thank God, Arthur, I have no baby to\r\nsuffer with me. Here,--here, it is still very bad. When I think of\r\npapa creeping in and out of his house, I sometimes feel that I must\r\nkill myself. But our going will put an end to all that. It is much\r\nbetter that we should go. I wish we might start to-morrow." Then she\r\nlooked up at him, and saw that the tears were running down his face,\r\nand as she looked she heard his sobs. "Why should you cry, Arthur?\r\nHe never cries,--nor do I. When baby died I cried,--but very little.\r\nTears are vain, foolish things. It has to be borne, and there is\r\nan end of it. When one makes up one\'s mind to that, one does not\r\ncry. There was a poor woman here the other day whose husband he had\r\nruined. She wept and bewailed herself till I pitied her almost more\r\nthan myself;--but then she had children."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Emily!"\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t call me by my name, because he would be angry. I have to\r\ndo, you know, as he tells me. And I do so strive to do it! Through\r\nit all I have an idea that if I do my duty it will be better for me.\r\nThere are things, you know, which a husband may tell you to do, but\r\nyou cannot do. If he tells me to rob, I am not to rob;--am I? And\r\nnow I think of it, you ought not to be here. He would be very much\r\ndispleased. But it has been so pleasant once more to see an old\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\n"I care nothing for his anger," said Arthur moodily.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but I do. I have to care for it."\r\n\r\n"Leave him! Why don\'t you leave him?"\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\n"You cannot deceive me. You do not try to deceive me. You know that\r\nhe is altogether unworthy of you."\r\n\r\n"I will hear nothing of the kind, sir."\r\n\r\n"How can I speak otherwise when you yourself tell me of your own\r\nmisery? Is it possible that I should not know what he is? Would you\r\nhave me pretend to think well of him?"\r\n\r\n"You can hold your tongue, Arthur."\r\n\r\n"No;--I cannot hold my tongue. Have I not held my tongue ever since\r\nyou married? And if I am to speak at all, must I not speak now?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to be said that can serve us at all."\r\n\r\n"Then it shall be said without serving. When I bid you leave him, it\r\nis not that you may come to me. Though I love you better than all the\r\nworld put together, I do not mean that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Arthur, Arthur!"\r\n\r\n"But let your father save you. Only tell him that you will stay with\r\nhim, and he will do it. Though I should never see you again, I could\r\nhope to protect you. Of course, I know,--and you know. He is--a\r\nscoundrel!"\r\n\r\n"I will not hear it," said she, rising from her seat on the sofa with\r\nher hands up to her forehead, but still coming nearer to him as she\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n"Does not your father say the same thing? I will advise nothing that\r\nhe does not advise. I would not say a word to you that he might not\r\nhear. I do love you. I have always loved you. But do you think that I\r\nwould hurt you with my love?"\r\n\r\n"No;--no;--no!"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed;--but I would have you feel that those who loved you of\r\nold are still anxious for your welfare. You said just now that you\r\nhad been neglected."\r\n\r\n"I spoke of papa and Everett. For myself,--of course I have separated\r\nmyself from everybody."\r\n\r\n"Never from me. You may be ten times his wife, but you cannot\r\nseparate yourself from me. Getting up in the morning and going to\r\nbed at night I still tell myself that you are the one woman that I\r\nlove. Stay with us, and you shall be honoured,--as that man\'s wife of\r\ncourse, but still as the dearest friend we have."\r\n\r\n"I cannot stay," she said. "He has told me that I am to go, and I am\r\nin his hands. When you have a wife, Arthur, you will wish her to do\r\nyour bidding. I hope she will do it for your sake, without the pain I\r\nhave in doing his. Good-bye, dear friend."\r\n\r\nShe put her hand out and he grasped it, and stood for a moment\r\nlooking at her. Then he seized her in his arms and kissed her brow\r\nand her lips. "Oh, Emily, why were you not my wife? My darling, my\r\ndarling!"\r\n\r\nShe had hardly extricated herself when the door opened, and Lopez\r\nstood in the room. "Mr. Fletcher," he said, very calmly, "what is the\r\nmeaning of this?"\r\n\r\n"He has come to bid me farewell," said Emily. "When going on so long\r\na journey one likes to see one\'s old friends,--perhaps for the last\r\ntime." There was something of indifference to his anger in her tone,\r\nand something also of scorn.\r\n\r\nLopez looked from one to the other, affecting an air of great\r\ndispleasure. "You know, sir," he said, "that you cannot be welcome\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"But he has been welcome," said his wife.\r\n\r\n"And I look upon your coming as a base act. You are here with the\r\nintention of creating discord between me and my wife."\r\n\r\n"I am here to tell her that she has a friend to trust to if she ever\r\nwants a friend," said Fletcher.\r\n\r\n"And you think that such trust as that would be safer than trust in\r\nher husband? I cannot turn you out of this house, sir, because it\r\ndoes not belong to me, but I desire you to leave at once the room\r\nwhich is occupied by my wife." Fletcher paused a moment to say\r\ngood-bye to the poor woman, while Lopez continued with increased\r\nindignation, "If you do not go at once you will force me to desire\r\nher to retire. She shall not remain in the same room with you."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Mr. Fletcher," she said, again putting out her hand.\r\n\r\nBut Lopez struck it up, not violently, so as to hurt her, but still\r\nwith eager roughness. "Not in my presence," he said. "Go, sir, when\r\nI desire you."\r\n\r\n"God bless you, my friend," said Arthur Fletcher. "I pray that I may\r\nlive to see you back in the old country."\r\n\r\n"He was--kissing you," said Lopez, as soon as the door was shut.\r\n\r\n"He was," said Emily.\r\n\r\n"And you tell me so to my face, with such an air as that!"\r\n\r\n"What am I to tell you when you ask me? I did not bid him kiss me."\r\n\r\n"But afterwards you took his part as his friend."\r\n\r\n"Why not? I should lie to you if I pretended that I was angry with\r\nhim for what he did."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will tell me that you love him."\r\n\r\n"Of course I love him. There are different kinds of love, Ferdinand.\r\nThere is that which a woman gives to a man when she would fain mate\r\nwith him. It is the sweetest love of all, if it would only last. And\r\nthere is another love,--which is not given, but which is won, perhaps\r\nthrough long years, by old friends. I have none older than Arthur\r\nFletcher, and none who are dearer to me."\r\n\r\n"And you think it right that he should take you in his arms and kiss\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"On such an occasion I could not blame him."\r\n\r\n"You were ready enough to receive it, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Well; I was. He has loved me well, and I shall never see him again.\r\nHe is very dear to me, and I was parting from him for ever. It was\r\nthe first and the last, and I did not grudge it to him. You must\r\nremember, Ferdinand, that you are taking me across the world from all\r\nmy friends."\r\n\r\n"Psha," he said, "that is all over. You are not going anywhere that\r\nI know of,--unless it be out into the streets when your father shuts\r\nhis door on you." And so saying he left the room without another\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\nThe Tenway Junction\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd thus the knowledge was conveyed to Mrs. Lopez that her fate in\r\nlife was not to carry her to Guatemala. At the very moment in which\r\nshe had been summoned to meet Arthur Fletcher she had been busy with\r\nher needle preparing that almost endless collection of garments\r\nnecessary for a journey of many days at sea. And now she was\r\ninformed, by a chance expression, by a word aside, as it were, that\r\nthe journey was not to be made. "That is all over," he had said,--and\r\nthen had left her, telling her nothing further. Of course she stayed\r\nher needle. Whether the last word had been true or false, she could\r\nnot work again, at any rate till it had been contradicted. If it were\r\nso, what was to be her fate? One thing was certain to her;--that she\r\ncould not remain under her father\'s roof. It was impossible that an\r\narrangement so utterly distasteful as the present one, both to her\r\nfather and to herself, should be continued. But where then should\r\nthey live,--and of what nature would her life be if she should be\r\nseparated from her father?\r\n\r\nThat evening she saw her father, and he corroborated her husband\'s\r\nstatement. "It is all over now," he said,--"that scheme of his of\r\ngoing to superintend the mines. The mines don\'t want him, and won\'t\r\nhave him. I can\'t say that I wonder at it."\r\n\r\n"What are we to do, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Ah;--that I cannot say. I suppose he will condescend still to honour\r\nme with his company. I do not know why he should wish to go to\r\nGuatemala or elsewhere. He has everything here that he can want."\r\n\r\n"You know, papa, that that is impossible."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say what with him is possible or impossible. He is bound by\r\nnone of the ordinary rules of mankind."\r\n\r\nThat evening Lopez returned to his dinner in Manchester Square, which\r\nwas still regularly served for him and his wife, though the servants\r\nwho attended upon him did so under silent and oft-repeated protest.\r\nHe said not a word more as to Arthur Fletcher, nor did he seek any\r\nground of quarrel with his wife. But that her continued melancholy\r\nand dejection made anything like good-humour impossible, even on his\r\npart, he would have been good-humoured. When they were alone she\r\nasked him as to their future destiny. "Papa tells me you are not\r\ngoing," she began by saying.\r\n\r\n"Did I not tell you so this morning?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--you said so. But I did not know you were earnest. Is it all\r\nover?"\r\n\r\n"All over,--I suppose."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought that you would have told me with more--more\r\nseriousness."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you would have. I was serious enough. The fact\r\nis, that your father has delayed so long the payment of the promised\r\nmoney that the thing has fallen through of necessity. I do not know\r\nthat I can blame the Company."\r\n\r\nThen there was a pause. "And now," she said, "what do you mean to\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I cannot say. I am quite as much in the dark as you can\r\nbe."\r\n\r\n"That is nonsense, Ferdinand."\r\n\r\n"Thank you! Let it be nonsense if you will. It seems to me that there\r\nis a great deal of nonsense going on in the world; but very little of\r\nit as true as what I say now."\r\n\r\n"But it is your duty to know. Of course you cannot stay here."\r\n\r\n"Nor you, I suppose,--without me."\r\n\r\n"I am not speaking of myself. If you choose, I can remain here."\r\n\r\n"And--just throw me overboard altogether."\r\n\r\n"If you provide another home for me, I will go to it. However poor it\r\nmay be I will go to it, if you bid me. But for you,--of course you\r\ncannot stay here."\r\n\r\n"Has your father told you to say so to me?"\r\n\r\n"No;--but I can say so without his telling me. You are banishing him\r\nfrom his own house. He has put up with it while he thought that you\r\nwere going to this foreign country; but there must be an end of that\r\nnow. You must have some scheme of life?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my soul I have none."\r\n\r\n"You must have some intentions for the future?"\r\n\r\n"None in the least. I have had intentions, and they have\r\nfailed;--from want of that support which I had a right to expect. I\r\nhave struggled and I have failed, and now I have got no intentions.\r\nWhat are yours?"\r\n\r\n"It is not my duty to have any purpose, as what I do must depend on\r\nyour commands." Then again there was a silence, during which he lit\r\na cigar, although he was sitting in the drawing-room. This was a\r\nprofanation of the room on which even he had never ventured before,\r\nbut at the present moment she was unable to notice it by any words.\r\n"I must tell papa," she said after a while, "what our plans are."\r\n\r\n"You can tell him what you please. I have literally nothing to say to\r\nhim. If he will settle an adequate income on us, payable of course\r\nto me, I will go and live elsewhere. If he turns me into the street\r\nwithout provision, he must turn you too. That is all that I have got\r\nto say. It will come better from you than from me. I am sorry, of\r\ncourse, that things have gone wrong with me. When I found myself\r\nthe son-in-law of a very rich man I thought that I might spread my\r\nwings a bit. But my rich father-in-law threw me over, and now I am\r\nhelpless. You are not very cheerful, my dear, and I think I\'ll go\r\ndown to the club."\r\n\r\nHe went out of the house and did go down to the Progress. The\r\ncommittee which was to be held with the view of judging whether he\r\nwas or was not a proper person to remain a member of that assemblage\r\nhad not yet been held, and there was nothing to impede his entrance\r\nto the club, or the execution of the command which he gave for tea\r\nand buttered toast. But no one spoke to him; nor, though he affected\r\na look of comfort, did he find himself much at his ease. Among the\r\nmembers of the club there was a much divided opinion whether he\r\nshould be expelled or not. There was a strong party who declared that\r\nhis conduct socially, morally, and politically, had been so bad that\r\nnothing short of expulsion would meet the case. But there were others\r\nwho said that no act had been proved against him which the club ought\r\nto notice. He had, no doubt, shown himself to be a blackguard, a man\r\nwithout a spark of honour or honesty. But then,--as they said who\r\nthought his position in the club to be unassailable,--what had the\r\nclub to do with that? "If you turn out all the blackguards and all\r\nthe dishonourable men, where will the club be?" was a question asked\r\nwith a great deal of vigour by one middle-aged gentleman who was\r\nsupposed to know the club-world very thoroughly. He had committed no\r\noffence which the law could recognise and punish, nor had he sinned\r\nagainst the club rules. "He is not required to be a man of honour by\r\nany regulation of which I am aware," said the middle-aged gentleman.\r\nThe general opinion seemed to be that he should be asked to go, and\r\nthat, if he declined, no one should speak to him. This penalty was\r\nalready inflicted on him, for on the evening in question no one did\r\nspeak to him.\r\n\r\nHe drank his tea and ate his toast and read a magazine, striving to\r\nlook as comfortable and as much at his ease as men at their clubs\r\ngenerally are. He was not a bad actor, and those who saw him and made\r\nreports as to his conduct on the following day declared that he had\r\napparently been quite indifferent to the disagreeable incidents of\r\nhis position. But his indifference had been mere acting. His careless\r\nmanner with his wife had been all assumed. Selfish as he was, void as\r\nhe was of all principle, utterly unmanly and even unconscious of the\r\nworth of manliness, still he was alive to the opinions of others. He\r\nthought that the world was wrong to condemn him,--that the world did\r\nnot understand the facts of his case, and that the world generally\r\nwould have done as he had done in similar circumstances. He did not\r\nknow that there was such a quality as honesty, nor did he understand\r\nwhat the word meant. But he did know that some men, an unfortunate\r\nclass, became subject to evil report from others who were more\r\nsuccessful, and he was aware that he had become one of those\r\nunfortunates. Nor could he see any remedy for his position. It was\r\nall blank and black before him. It may be doubted whether he got much\r\ninstruction or amusement from the pages of the magazine which he\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nAt about twelve o\'clock he left the club and took his way homewards.\r\nBut he did not go straight home. It was a nasty cold March night,\r\nwith a catching wind, and occasional short showers of something\r\nbetween snow and rain,--as disagreeable a night for a gentleman to\r\nwalk in as one could well conceive. But he went round by Trafalgar\r\nSquare, and along the Strand, and up some dirty streets by the\r\nsmall theatres, and so on to Holborn and by Bloomsbury Square up to\r\nTottenham Court Road, then through some unused street into Portland\r\nPlace, along the Marylebone Road, and back to Manchester Square by\r\nBaker Street. He had more than doubled the distance,--apparently\r\nwithout any object. He had been spoken to frequently by unfortunates\r\nof both sexes, but had answered a word to no one. He had trudged on\r\nand on with his umbrella over his head, but almost unconscious of the\r\ncold and wet. And yet he was a man sedulously attentive to his own\r\npersonal comfort and health, who had at any rate shown this virtue in\r\nhis mode of living, that he had never subjected himself to danger by\r\nimprudence. But now the working of his mind kept him warm, and, if\r\nnot dry, at least indifferent to the damp. He had thrown aside with\r\naffected nonchalance those questions which his wife had asked him,\r\nbut still it was necessary that he should answer them. He did not\r\nsuppose that he could continue to live in Manchester Square in his\r\npresent condition. Nor, if it was necessary that he should wander\r\nforth into the world, could he force his wife to wander with him. If\r\nhe would consent to leave her, his father-in-law would probably give\r\nhim something,--some allowance on which he might exist. But then of\r\nwhat sort would be his life?\r\n\r\nHe did not fail to remind himself over and over again that he had\r\nnearly succeeded. He had been the guest of the Prime Minister, and\r\nhad been the nominee chosen by a Duchess to represent her husband\'s\r\nborough in Parliament. He had been intimate with Mills Happerton who\r\nwas fast becoming a millionaire. He had married much above himself in\r\nevery way. He had achieved a certain popularity and was conscious of\r\nintellect. But at the present moment two or three sovereigns in his\r\npocket were the extent of his worldly wealth and his character was\r\nutterly ruined. He regarded his fate as does a card-player who day\r\nafter day holds sixes and sevens when other men have the aces and\r\nkings. Fate was against him. He saw no reason why he should not have\r\nhad the aces and kings continually, especially as fate had given him\r\nperhaps more than his share of them at first. He had, however, lost\r\nrubber after rubber,--not paying his stakes for some of the last\r\nrubbers lost,--till the players would play with him no longer. The\r\nmisfortune might have happened to any man;--but it had happened to\r\nhim. There was no beginning again. A possible small allowance and\r\nsome very retired and solitary life, in which there would be no show\r\nof honour, no flattery coming to him, was all that was left to him.\r\n\r\nHe let himself in at the house, and found his wife still awake. "I am\r\nwet to the skin," he said. "I made up my mind to walk, and I would do\r\nit;--but I am a fool for my pains." She made him some feeble answer,\r\naffecting to be half asleep, and merely turned in her bed. "I must\r\nbe out early in the morning. Mind you make them dry my things. They\r\nnever do anything for my telling."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want them dried to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Not to-night, of course;--but after I am gone to-morrow. They\'ll\r\nleave them there without putting a hand to them, if you don\'t speak.\r\nI must be off before breakfast to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Where are you going? Do you want anything packed?"\r\n\r\n"No; nothing. I shall be back to dinner. But I must go down to\r\nBirmingham, to see a friend of Happerton\'s on business. I will\r\nbreakfast at the station. As you said to-day, something must be done.\r\nIf it\'s to sweep a crossing, I must sweep it."\r\n\r\nAs she lay awake while he slept, she thought that those last words\r\nwere the best she had heard him speak since they were married. There\r\nseemed to be some indication of a purpose in them. If he would\r\nonly sweep a crossing as a man should sweep it, she would stand\r\nby him, and at any rate do her duty to him, in spite of all that\r\nhad happened. Alas! she was not old enough to have learned that a\r\ndishonest man cannot begin even to sweep a crossing honestly till he\r\nhave in very truth repented of his former dishonesty. The lazy man\r\nmay become lazy no longer, but there must have been first a process\r\nthrough his mind whereby laziness has become odious to him. And that\r\nprocess can hardly be the immediate result of misfortune arising\r\nfrom misconduct. Had Lopez found his crossing at Birmingham he would\r\nhardly have swept it well.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning he was up, and before he left his\r\nroom he kissed his wife. "Good-bye, old girl," he said; "don\'t be\r\ndown-hearted."\r\n\r\n"If you have anything before you to do, I will not be down-hearted,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n"I shall have something to do before night, I think. Tell your\r\nfather, when you see him, that I will not trouble him here much\r\nlonger. But tell him, also, that I have no thanks to give him for his\r\nhospitality."\r\n\r\n"I will not tell him that, Ferdinand."\r\n\r\n"He shall know it, though. But I do not mean to be cross to you.\r\nGood-bye, love." Then he stooped over her and kissed her again;--and\r\nso he took his leave of her.\r\n\r\nIt was raining hard, and when he got into the street he looked about\r\nfor a cab, but there was none to be found. In Baker Street he got an\r\nomnibus which took him down to the underground railway, and by that\r\nhe went to Gower Street. Through the rain he walked up to the Euston\r\nStation, and there he ordered breakfast. Could he have a mutton chop\r\nand some tea? And he was very particular that the mutton chop should\r\nbe well cooked. He was a good-looking man, of fashionable appearance,\r\nand the young lady who attended him noticed him and was courteous to\r\nhim. He condescended even to have a little light conversation with\r\nher, and, on the whole, he seemed to enjoy his breakfast. "Upon my\r\nword, I should like to breakfast here every day of my life," he said.\r\nThe young lady assured him that, as far as she could see, there was\r\nno objection to such an arrangement. "Only it\'s a bore, you know,\r\ncoming out in the rain when there are no cabs," he said. Then there\r\nwere various little jokes between them, till the young lady was quite\r\nimpressed with the gentleman\'s pleasant affability.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he went back into the hall and took a first-class\r\nreturn ticket, not for Birmingham, but for the Tenway Junction. It\r\nis quite unnecessary to describe the Tenway Junction, as everybody\r\nknows it. From this spot, some six or seven miles distant from\r\nLondon, lines diverge east, west, and north, north-east, and\r\nnorth-west, round the metropolis in every direction, and with direct\r\ncommunication with every other line in and out of London. It is a\r\nmarvellous place, quite unintelligible to the uninitiated, and yet\r\ndaily used by thousands who only know that when they get there,\r\nthey are to do what some one tells them. The space occupied by the\r\nconvergent rails seems to be sufficient for a large farm. And these\r\nrails always run one into another with sloping points, and cross\r\npassages, and mysterious meandering sidings, till it seems to the\r\nthoughtful stranger to be impossible that the best trained engine\r\nshould know its own line. Here and there and around there is ever a\r\nwilderness of waggons, some loaded, some empty, some smoking with\r\nclose-packed oxen, and others furlongs in length black with coals,\r\nwhich look as though they had been stranded there by chance, and were\r\nnever destined to get again into the right path of traffic. Not a\r\nminute passes without a train going here or there, some rushing by\r\nwithout noticing Tenway in the least, crashing through like flashes\r\nof substantial lightning, and others stopping, disgorging and taking\r\nup passengers by the hundreds. Men and women,--especially the men,\r\nfor the women knowing their ignorance are generally willing to trust\r\nto the pundits of the place,--look doubtful, uneasy, and bewildered.\r\nBut they all do get properly placed and unplaced, so that the\r\nspectator at last acknowledges that over all this apparent chaos\r\nthere is presiding a great genius of order. From dusky morn to dark\r\nnight, and indeed almost throughout the night, the air is loaded\r\nwith a succession of shrieks. The theory goes that each separate\r\nshriek,--if there can be any separation where the sound is so nearly\r\ncontinuous,--is a separate notice to separate ears of the coming or\r\ngoing of a separate train. The stranger, as he speculates on these\r\npandemoniac noises, is able to realise the idea that were they\r\ndiscontinued the excitement necessary for the minds of the pundits\r\nmight be lowered, and that activity might be lessened, and evil\r\nresults might follow. But he cannot bring himself to credit that\r\ntheory of individual notices.\r\n\r\nAt Tenway Junction there are half-a-dozen long platforms, on which\r\nmen and women and luggage are crowded. On one of these for a while\r\nFerdinand Lopez walked backwards and forwards as though waiting for\r\nthe coming of some especial train. The crowd is ever so great that\r\na man might be supposed to walk there from morning to night without\r\nexciting special notice. But the pundits are very clever, and have\r\nmuch experience in men and women. A well-taught pundit, who has\r\nexercised authority for a year or two at such a station as that of\r\nTenway, will know within a minute of the appearance of each stranger\r\nwhat is his purpose there,--whether he be going or has just come,\r\nwhether he is himself on the way or waiting for others, whether he\r\nshould be treated with civility or with some curt command,--so that\r\nif his purport be honest all necessary assistance may be rendered\r\nhim. As Lopez was walking up and down, with smiling face and\r\nleisurely pace, now reading an advertisement and now watching the\r\ncontortions of some amazed passenger, a certain pundit asked him\r\nhis business. He was waiting, he said, for a train from Liverpool,\r\nintending, when his friend arrived, to go with him to Dulwich by a\r\ntrain which went round the west of London. It was all feasible, and\r\nthe pundit told him that the stopping train from Liverpool was due\r\nthere in six minutes, but that the express from the north would\r\npass first. Lopez thanked the pundit and gave him sixpence,--which\r\nmade the pundit suspicious. A pundit hopes to be paid when he\r\nhandles luggage, but has no such expectation when he merely gives\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe pundit still had his eye on our friend when the shriek and the\r\nwhirr of the express from the north was heard. Lopez walked quickly\r\nup towards the edge of the platform, when the pundit followed him,\r\ntelling him that this was not his train. Lopez then ran a few yards\r\nalong the platform, not noticing the man, reaching a spot that was\r\nunoccupied;--and there he stood fixed. And as he stood the express\r\nflashed by. "I am fond of seeing them pass like that," said Lopez to\r\nthe man who had followed him.\r\n\r\n"But you shouldn\'t do it, sir," said the suspicious pundit. "No one\r\nisn\'t allowed to stand near like that. The very hair of it might take\r\nyou off your legs when you\'re not used to it."\r\n\r\n"All right, old fellow," said Lopez, retreating. The next train was\r\nthe Liverpool train; and it seemed that our friend\'s friend had not\r\ncome, for when the Liverpool passengers had cleared themselves off,\r\nhe was still walking up and down the platform. "He\'ll come by the\r\nnext," said Lopez to the pundit, who now followed him about and kept\r\nan eye on him.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t another from Liverpool stopping here till the 2.20,"\r\nsaid the pundit. "You had better come again if you mean to meet him\r\nby that."\r\n\r\n"He has come on part of the way, and will reach this by some other\r\ntrain," said Lopez.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t nothing he can come by," said the pundit. "Gentlemen\r\ncan\'t wait here all day, sir. The horders is against waiting on the\r\nplatform."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Lopez, moving away as though to make his exit\r\nthrough the station.\r\n\r\nNow Tenway Junction is so big a place, and so scattered, that it\r\nis impossible that all the pundits should by any combined activity\r\nmaintain to the letter that order of which our special pundit had\r\nspoken. Lopez, departing from the platform which he had hitherto\r\noccupied, was soon to be seen on another, walking up and down, and\r\nagain waiting. But the old pundit had had his eye upon him, and had\r\nfollowed him round. At that moment there came a shriek louder than\r\nall the other shrieks, and the morning express down from Euston to\r\nInverness was seen coming round the curve at a thousand miles an\r\nhour. Lopez turned round and looked at it, and again walked towards\r\nthe edge of the platform. But now it was not exactly the edge that he\r\nneared, but a descent to a pathway,--an inclined plane leading down\r\nto the level of the rails, and made there for certain purposes of\r\ntraffic. As he did so the pundit called to him, and then made a rush\r\nat him,--for our friend\'s back was turned to the coming train. But\r\nLopez heeded not the call, and the rush was too late. With quick,\r\nbut still with gentle and apparently unhurried steps, he walked down\r\nbefore the flying engine--and in a moment had been knocked into\r\nbloody atoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\nThe Widow and Her Friends\r\n\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe described in the last chapter had taken place during\r\nthe first week in March. By the end of that month old Mr. Wharton\r\nhad probably reconciled himself to the tragedy, although in fact it\r\nhad affected him very deeply. In the first days after the news had\r\nreached him he seemed to be bowed to the ground. Stone Buildings were\r\nneglected, and the Eldon saw nothing of him. Indeed, he barely left\r\nthe house from which he had been so long banished by the presence of\r\nhis son-in-law. It seemed to Everett, who now came to live with him\r\nand his sister, as though his father were overcome by the horror of\r\nthe affair. But after awhile he recovered himself, and appeared one\r\nmorning in court with his wig and gown, and argued a case,--which was\r\nnow unusual with him,--as though to show the world that a dreadful\r\nepisode in his life was passed, and should be thought of no more. At\r\nthis period, three or four weeks after the occurrence,--he rarely\r\nspoke to his daughter about Lopez; but to Everett the man\'s name\r\nwould be often on his tongue. "I do not know that there could have\r\nbeen any other deliverance," he said to his son one day. "I thought\r\nit would have killed me when I first heard it, and it nearly killed\r\nher. But, at any rate, now there is peace."\r\n\r\nBut the widow seemed to feel it more as time went on. At first she\r\nwas stunned, and for a while absolutely senseless. It was not till\r\ntwo days after the occurrence that the fact became known to her,--nor\r\nknown as a certainty to her father and brother. It seemed as though\r\nthe man had been careful to carry with him no record of identity, the\r\nnature of which would permit it to outlive the crash of the train.\r\nNo card was found, no scrap of paper with his name; and it was\r\ndiscovered at last that when he left the house on the fatal morning\r\nhe had been careful to dress himself in shirt and socks, with\r\nhandkerchief and collar that had been newly purchased for his\r\nproposed journey and which bore no mark. The fragments of his body\r\nset identity at defiance, and even his watch had been crumpled into\r\nashes. Of course the fact became certain with no great delay. The man\r\nhimself was missing, and was accurately described both by the young\r\nlady from the refreshment room, and by the suspicious pundit who had\r\nactually seen the thing done. There was first belief that it was so,\r\nwhich was not communicated to Emily,--and then certainty.\r\n\r\nThere was an inquest held of course,--well, we will say on the\r\nbody,--and, singularly enough, great difference of opinion as to the\r\nmanner, though of course none as to the immediate cause of the death.\r\nHad it been accidental, or premeditated? The pundit, who in the\r\nperformance of his duties on the Tenway platforms was so efficient\r\nand valuable, gave half-a-dozen opinions in half-a-dozen minutes when\r\nsubjected to the questions of the Coroner. In his own mind he had not\r\nthe least doubt in the world as to what had happened. But he was made\r\nto believe that he was not to speak his own mind. The gentleman, he\r\nsaid, certainly might have walked down by accident. The gentleman\'s\r\nback was turned, and it was possible that the gentleman did not hear\r\nthe train. He was quite certain the gentleman knew of the train; but\r\nyet he could not say. The gentleman walked down before the train o\'\r\npurpose; but perhaps he didn\'t mean to do himself an injury. There\r\nwas a deal of this, till the Coroner, putting all his wrath into\r\nhis brow, told the man that he was a disgrace to the service, and\r\nexpressed a hope that the Company would no longer employ a man\r\nso evidently unfit for his position. But the man was in truth\r\na conscientious and useful railway pundit, with a large family,\r\nand evident capabilities for his business. At last a verdict was\r\ngiven,--that the man\'s name was Ferdinand Lopez, that he had been\r\ncrushed by an express train on the London and North Western Line, and\r\nthat there was no evidence to show how his presence on the line had\r\nbeen occasioned. Of course Mr. Wharton had employed counsel, and of\r\ncourse the counsel\'s object had been to avoid a verdict of felo de\r\nse. Appended to the verdict was a recommendation from the jury that\r\nthe Railway Company should be advised to signalise their express\r\ntrains more clearly at the Tenway Junction Station.\r\n\r\nWhen these tidings were told to the widow she had already given\r\nway to many fears. Lopez had gone, purporting,--as he said,--to be\r\nback to dinner. He had not come then, nor on the following morning;\r\nnor had he written. Then she remembered all that he had done and\r\nsaid;--how he had kissed her, and left a parting malediction for her\r\nfather. She did not at first imagine that he had destroyed himself,\r\nbut that he had gone away, intending to vanish as other men before\r\nnow have vanished. As she thought of this something almost like love\r\ncame back upon her heart. Of course he was bad. Even in her sorrow,\r\neven when alarmed as to his fate, she could not deny that. But her\r\noath to him had not been to love him only while he was good. She had\r\nmade herself a part of him, and was she not bound to be true to him,\r\nwhether good or bad? She implored her father and she implored her\r\nbrother to be ceaseless in their endeavours to trace him,--sometimes\r\nseeming almost to fear that in this respect she could not fully\r\ntrust them. Then she discerned from their manner a doubt as to her\r\nhusband\'s fate. "Oh, papa, if you think anything, tell me what you\r\nthink," she said late on the evening of the second day. He was then\r\nnearly sure that the man who had been killed at Tenway was Ferdinand\r\nLopez;--but he was not quite sure, and he would not tell her. But on\r\nthe following morning, somewhat before noon, having himself gone out\r\nearly to Euston Square, he came back to his own house,--and then he\r\ntold her all. For the first hour she did not shed a tear or lose her\r\nconsciousness of the horror of the thing;--but sat still and silent,\r\ngazing at nothing, casting back her mind over the history of her\r\nlife, and the misery which she had brought on all who belonged to\r\nher. Then at last she gave way, fell into tears, hysteric sobbings,\r\nconvulsions so violent as for a time to take the appearance of\r\nepileptic fits, and was at last exhausted and, happily for herself,\r\nunconscious.\r\n\r\nAfter that she was ill for many weeks,--so ill that at times both\r\nher father and her brother thought that she would die. When the\r\nfirst month or six weeks had passed by she would often speak of her\r\nhusband, especially to her father, and always speaking of him as\r\nthough she had brought him to his untimely fate. Nor could she endure\r\nat this time that her father should say a word against him, even when\r\nshe obliged the old man to speak of one whose conduct had been so\r\ninfamous. It had all been her doing! Had she not married him there\r\nwould have been no misfortune! She did not say that he had been\r\nnoble, true, or honest,--but she asserted that all the evils which\r\nhad come upon him had been produced by herself. "My dear," her father\r\nsaid to her one evening, "it is a matter which we cannot forget, but\r\non which it is well that we should be silent."\r\n\r\n"I shall always know what that silence means," she replied.\r\n\r\n"It will never mean condemnation of you by me," said he.\r\n\r\n"But I have destroyed your life,--and his. I know I ought not to have\r\nmarried him, because you bade me not. And I know that I should have\r\nbeen gentler with him, and more obedient, when I was his wife. I\r\nsometimes wish that I were a Catholic, and that I could go into a\r\nconvent, and bury it all amidst sackcloths and ashes."\r\n\r\n"That would not bury it," said her father.\r\n\r\n"But I should at least be buried. If I were out of sight, you might\r\nforget it all."\r\n\r\nShe once stirred Everett up to speak more plainly than her father\r\never dared to do, and then also she herself used language that was\r\nvery plain. "My darling," said her brother once, when she had been\r\ntrying to make out that her husband had been more sinned against than\r\nsinning,--"he was a bad man. It is better that the truth should be\r\ntold."\r\n\r\n"And who is a good man?" she said, raising herself in her bed and\r\nlooking him full in the face with her deep-sunken eyes. "If there be\r\nany truth in our religion, are we not all bad? Who is to tell the\r\nshades of difference in badness? He was not a drunkard, or a gambler.\r\nThrough it all he was true to his wife." She, poor creature, was of\r\ncourse ignorant of that little scene in the little street near May\r\nFair, in which Lopez had offered to carry Lizzie Eustace away with\r\nhim to Guatemala. "He was industrious. His ideas about money were\r\nnot the same as yours or papa\'s. How was he worse than others? It\r\nhappened that his faults were distasteful to you--and so, perhaps,\r\nwere his virtues."\r\n\r\n"His faults, such as they were, brought all these miseries."\r\n\r\n"He would have been successful now if he had never seen me. But why\r\nshould we talk of it? We shall never agree. And you, Everett, can\r\nnever understand all that has passed through my mind during the last\r\ntwo years."\r\n\r\nThere were two or three persons who attempted to see her at this\r\nperiod, but she avoided them all. First came Mrs. Roby, who, as her\r\nnearest neighbour, as her aunt, and as an aunt who had been so nearly\r\nallied to her, had almost a right to demand admittance. But she would\r\nnot see Mrs. Roby. She sent down word to say that she was too ill.\r\nAnd when Mrs. Roby wrote to her, she got her father to answer the\r\nnotes. "You had better let it drop," the old man said at last to his\r\nsister-in-law. "Of course she remembers that it was you who brought\r\nthem together."\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t bring them together, Mr. Wharton. How often am I to\r\ntell you so? It was Everett who brought Mr. Lopez here."\r\n\r\n"The marriage was made up in your house, and it has destroyed me and\r\nmy child. I will not quarrel with my wife\'s sister if I can help\r\nit, but at present you had better keep apart." Then he had left her\r\nabruptly, and Mrs. Roby had not dared either to write or to call\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt this time Arthur Fletcher saw both Everett and Mr. Wharton\r\nfrequently, but he did not go to the Square, contenting himself with\r\nasking whether he might be allowed to do so. "Not yet, Arthur," said\r\nthe old man. "I am sure she thinks of you as one of her best friends,\r\nbut she could not see you yet."\r\n\r\n"She would have nothing to fear," said Arthur. "We knew each other\r\nwhen we were children, and I should be now only as I was then."\r\n\r\n"Not yet, Arthur;--not yet," said the barrister.\r\n\r\nThen there came a letter, or rather two letters, from Mary\r\nWharton;--one to Mr. Wharton and the other to Emily. To tell the\r\ntruth as to these letters, they contained the combined wisdom and\r\ntenderness of Wharton Hall and Longbarns. As soon as the fate of\r\nLopez had been ascertained and thoroughly discussed in Herefordshire,\r\nthere went forth an edict that Emily had suffered punishment\r\nsufficient and was to be forgiven. Old Mrs. Fletcher did not come\r\nto this at once,--having some deep-seated feeling which she did\r\nnot dare to express even to her son, though she muttered it to her\r\ndaughter-in-law, that Arthur would be disgraced for ever were he\r\nto marry the widow of such a man as Ferdinand Lopez. But when this\r\nquestion of receiving Emily back into family favour was mooted in\r\nthe Longbarns Parliament no one alluded to the possibility of such\r\na marriage. There was the fact that she whom they had all loved had\r\nbeen freed by a great tragedy from the husband whom they had all\r\ncondemned,--and also the knowledge that the poor victim had suffered\r\ngreatly during the period of her married life. Mrs. Fletcher had\r\nfrowned, and shaken her head, and made a little speech about the\r\nduties of women, and the necessarily fatal consequences when those\r\nduties are neglected. There were present there, with the old lady,\r\nJohn Fletcher and his wife, Sir Alured and Lady Wharton, and Mary\r\nWharton. Arthur was not in the county, nor could the discussion have\r\nbeen held in his presence. "I can only say," said John, getting up\r\nand looking away from his mother, "that she shall always find a home\r\nat Longbarns when she chooses to come here, and I hope Sir Alured\r\nwill say the same as to Wharton Hall." After all, John Fletcher was\r\nking in these parts, and Mrs. Fletcher, with many noddings and some\r\nsobbing, had to give way to King John. The end of all this was that\r\nMary Wharton wrote her letters. In that to Mr. Wharton she asked\r\nwhether it would not be better that her cousin should change the\r\nscene and come at once into the country. Let her come and stay a\r\nmonth at Wharton, and then go on to Longbarns. She might be sure that\r\nthere would be no company in either house. In June the Fletchers\r\nwould go up to town for a week, and then Emily might return to\r\nWharton Hall. It was a long letter, and Mary gave many reasons why\r\nthe poor sufferer would be better in the country than in town. The\r\nletter to Emily herself was shorter but full of affection. "Do, do,\r\ndo come. You know how we all love you. Let it be as it used to be.\r\nYou always liked the country. I will devote myself to try and comfort\r\nyou." But Emily could not as yet submit to receive devotion even from\r\nher cousin Mary. Through it all, and under it all,--though she would\r\never defend her husband because he was dead,--she knew that she\r\nhad disgraced the Whartons and brought a load of sorrow upon the\r\nFletchers, and she was too proud to be forgiven so quickly.\r\n\r\nThen she received another tender of affection from a quarter whence\r\nshe certainly did not expect it. The Duchess of Omnium wrote to her.\r\nThe Duchess, though she had lately been considerably restrained by\r\nthe condition of the Duke\'s mind, and by the effects of her own\r\npolitical and social mistakes, still from time to time made renewed\r\nefforts to keep together the Coalition by giving dinners, balls, and\r\ngarden parties, and by binding to herself the gratitude and worship\r\nof young parliamentary aspirants. In carrying out her plans, she had\r\nlately showered her courtesies upon Arthur Fletcher, who had been\r\nmade welcome even by the Duke as the sitting member for Silverbridge.\r\nWith Arthur she had of course discussed the conduct of Lopez as\r\nto the election bills, and had been very loud in condemning him.\r\nAnd from Arthur also she had heard something of the sorrows of\r\nEmily Lopez. Arthur had been very desirous that the Duchess, who\r\nhad received them both at her house, should distinguish between\r\nthe husband and the wife. Then had come the tragedy, to which the\r\nnotoriety of the man\'s conduct of course gave additional interest. It\r\nwas believed that Lopez had destroyed himself because of the disgrace\r\nwhich had fallen upon him from the Silverbridge affair. And for much\r\nof that Silverbridge affair the Duchess herself was responsible.\r\nShe waited till a couple of months had gone by, and then, in the\r\nbeginning of May, sent to the widow what was intended to be, and\r\nindeed was, a very kind note. The Duchess had heard the sad story\r\nwith the greatest grief. She hoped that Mrs. Lopez would permit her\r\nto avail herself of a short acquaintance to express her sincere\r\nsympathy. She would not venture to call as yet, but hoped that before\r\nlong she might be allowed to come to Manchester Square.\r\n\r\nThis note touched the poor woman to whom it was written, not because\r\nshe herself was solicitous to be acquainted with the Duchess of\r\nOmnium, but because the application seemed to her to contain\r\nsomething like an acquittal, or at any rate a pardon, of her husband.\r\nHis sin in that measure of the Silverbridge election,--a sin which\r\nher father had been loud in denouncing before the wretch had\r\ndestroyed himself,--had been especially against the Duke of Omnium.\r\nAnd now the Duchess came forward to say that it should be forgiven\r\nand forgotten. When she showed the letter to her father, and asked\r\nhim what she should say in answer to it, he only shook his head. "It\r\nis meant for kindness, papa."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I think it is. There are people who have no right to be kind\r\nto me. If a man stopped me in the street and offered me half-a-crown\r\nit might be kindness;--but I don\'t want the man\'s half-crown."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it is the same, papa. There is a reason here."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so, my dear; but I do not see the reason."\r\n\r\nShe became very red, but even to him she would not explain her ideas.\r\n"I think I shall answer it."\r\n\r\n"Certainly answer it. Your compliments to the Duchess and thank her\r\nfor her kind inquiries."\r\n\r\n"But she says she will come here."\r\n\r\n"I should not notice that."\r\n\r\n"Very well, papa. If you think so, of course I will not. Perhaps it\r\nwould be an inconvenience, if she were really to come." On the next\r\nday she did write a note, not quite so cold as that which her father\r\nproposed, but still saying nothing as to the offered visit. She felt,\r\nshe said, very grateful for the Duchess\'s kind remembrance of her.\r\nThe Duchess would perhaps understand that at present her sorrow\r\noverwhelmed her.\r\n\r\nAnd there was one other tender of kindness which was more surprising\r\nthan even that from the Duchess. The reader may perhaps remember that\r\nFerdinand Lopez and Lady Eustace had not parted when they last saw\r\neach other on the pleasantest terms. He had been very affectionate,\r\nbut when he had proposed to devote his whole life to her and to carry\r\nher off to Guatemala she had simply told him that he was--a fool.\r\nThen he had escaped from her house and had never again seen Lizzie\r\nEustace. She had not thought very much about it. Had he returned to\r\nher the next day with some more tempting proposition for making money\r\nshe would have listened to him,--and had he begged her pardon for\r\nwhat had taken place on the former day she would have merely laughed.\r\nShe was not more offended than she would have been had he asked her\r\nfor half her fortune instead of her person and her honour. But, as it\r\nwas, he had escaped and had never again shown himself in the little\r\nstreet near May Fair. Then she had the tidings of his death, first\r\nseeing the account in a very sensational article from the pen of Mr.\r\nQuintus Slide himself. She was immediately filled with an intense\r\ninterest which was infinitely increased by the fact that the man\r\nhad but a few days before declared himself to be her lover. It was\r\nbringing her almost as near to the event as though she had seen it!\r\nShe was, perhaps, entitled to think that she had caused it! Nay;--in\r\none sense she had caused it, for he certainly would not have\r\ndestroyed himself had she consented to go with him to Guatemala or\r\nelsewhere. And she knew his wife. An uninteresting, dowdy creature\r\nshe had called her. But, nevertheless, they had been in company\r\ntogether more than once. So she presented her compliments, and\r\nexpressed her sorrow, and hoped that she might be allowed to call.\r\nThere had been no one for whom she had felt more sincere respect and\r\nesteem than for her late friend Mr. Ferdinand Lopez. To this note\r\nthere was sent an answer written by Mr. Wharton himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MADAM,\r\n\r\n   My daughter is too ill to see even her own friends.\r\n\r\n   I am, Madam,\r\n   Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n   ABEL WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, life went on in a very quiet way at Manchester Square\r\nfor many weeks. Gradually Mrs. Lopez recovered her capability of\r\nattending to the duties of life. Gradually she became again able\r\nto interest herself in her brother\'s pursuits and in her father\'s\r\ncomforts, and the house returned to its old form as it had been\r\nbefore these terrible two years, in which the happiness of the\r\nWharton and Fletcher families had been marred, and scotched, and\r\nalmost destroyed for ever by the interference of Ferdinand Lopez.\r\nBut Mrs. Lopez never for a moment forgot that she had done the\r\nmischief,--and that the black enduring cloud had been created solely\r\nby her own perversity and self-will. Though she would still defend\r\nher late husband if any attack were made upon his memory, not the\r\nless did she feel that hers had been the fault, though the punishment\r\nhad come upon them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\nPhineas Finn Has a Book to Read\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sensation created by the man\'s death was by no means confined\r\nto Manchester Square, but was very general in the metropolis, and,\r\nindeed, throughout the country. As the catastrophe became the subject\r\nof general conversation, many people learned that the Silverbridge\r\naffair had not, in truth, had much to do with it. The man had killed\r\nhimself, as many other men have done before him, because he had run\r\nthrough his money and had no chance left of redeeming himself. But to\r\nthe world at large, the disgrace brought upon him by the explanation\r\ngiven in Parliament was the apparent cause of his self-immolation,\r\nand there were not wanting those who felt and expressed a sympathy\r\nfor a man who could feel so acutely the effect of his own\r\nwrong-doing. No doubt he had done wrong in asking the Duke for the\r\nmoney. But the request, though wrong, might almost be justified.\r\nThere could be no doubt, these apologists said, that he had been\r\nill-treated between the Duke and the Duchess. No doubt Phineas Finn,\r\nwho was now described by some opponents as the Duke\'s creature, had\r\nbeen able to make out a story in the Duke\'s favour. But all the\r\nworld knew what was the worth and what was the truth of ministerial\r\nexplanations! The Coalition was very strong; and even the question\r\nin the House, which should have been hostile, had been asked in a\r\nfriendly spirit. In this way there came to be a party who spoke and\r\nwrote of Ferdinand Lopez as though he had been a martyr.\r\n\r\nOf course Mr. Quintus Slide was in the front rank of these accusers.\r\nHe may be said to have led the little army which made this matter\r\na pretext for a special attack upon the Ministry. Mr. Slide was\r\nespecially hostile to the Prime Minister, but he was not less hotly\r\nthe enemy of Phineas Finn. Against Phineas Finn he had old grudges,\r\nwhich, however, age had never cooled. He could, therefore, write with\r\na most powerful pen when discussing the death of that unfortunate\r\nman, the late candidate for Silverbridge, crushing his two foes in\r\nthe single grasp of his journalistic fist. Phineas had certainly\r\nsaid some hard things against Lopez, though he had not mentioned\r\nthe man\'s name. He had congratulated the House that it had not been\r\ncontaminated by the presence of so base a creature, and he had said\r\nthat he would not pause to stigmatise the meanness of the application\r\nfor money which Lopez had made. Had Lopez continued to live and to\r\nendure "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," no one would\r\nhave ventured to say that these words would have inflicted too severe\r\na punishment. But death wipes out many faults, and a self-inflicted\r\ndeath caused by remorse will, in the minds of many, wash a blackamoor\r\nalmost white. Thus it came to pass that some heavy weapons were\r\nhurled at Phineas Finn, but none so heavy as those hurled by Quintus\r\nSlide. Should not this Irish knight, who was so ready with his\r\nlance in the defence of the Prime Minister, asked Mr. Slide, have\r\nremembered the past events of his own rather peculiar life? Had not\r\nhe, too, been poor, and driven in his poverty to rather questionable\r\nstraits? Had not he been abject in his petition for office,--and in\r\nwhat degree were such petitions less disgraceful than a request for\r\nmoney which had been hopelessly expended on an impossible object,\r\nattempted at the instance of the great Croesus who, when asked to\r\npay it, had at once acknowledged the necessity of doing so? Could\r\nnot Mr. Finn remember that he himself had stood in danger of his\r\nlife before a British jury, and that, though he had been, no doubt\r\nproperly, acquitted of the crime imputed to him, circumstances had\r\ncome out against him during the trial which, if not as criminal, were\r\nat any rate almost as disgraceful? Could he not have had some mercy\r\non a broken political adventurer who, in his aspirations for public\r\nlife, had shown none of that greed by which Mr. Phineas Finn had\r\nbeen characterised in all the relations of life? As for the Prime\r\nMinister, "We," as Mr. Quintus Slide always described himself,--"We\r\ndo not wish to add to the agony which the fate of Mr. Lopez must\r\nhave brought upon him. He has hounded that poor man to his death\r\nin revenge for the trifling sum of money which he was called on to\r\npay for him. It may be that the first blame lay not with the Prime\r\nMinister himself, but with the Prime Minister\'s wife. With that we\r\nhave nothing to do. The whole thing lies in a nutshell. The bare\r\nmention of the name of her Grace the Duchess in Parliament would have\r\nsaved the Duke, at any rate as effectually as he has been saved by\r\nthe services of his man-of-all-work, Phineas Finn, and would have\r\nsaved him without driving poor Ferdinand Lopez to insanity. But\r\nrather than do this he allowed his servant to make statements about\r\nmysterious agents, which we are justified in stigmatizing as untrue,\r\nand to throw the whole blame where but least of the blame was due. We\r\nall know the result. It was found in those gory shreds and tatters\r\nof a poor human being with which the Tenway Railway Station was\r\nbespattered."\r\n\r\nOf course such an article had considerable effect. It was apparent at\r\nonce that there was ample room for an action for libel against the\r\nnewspaper, on the part of Phineas Finn if not on that of the Duke.\r\nBut it was equally apparent that Mr. Quintus Slide must have been\r\nvery well aware of this when he wrote the article. Such an action,\r\neven if successful, may bring with it to the man punished more of\r\ngood than of evil. Any pecuniary penalty might be more than recouped\r\nby the largeness of the advertisement which such an action would\r\nproduce. Mr. Slide no doubt calculated that he would carry with him a\r\ngreat body of public feeling by the mere fact that he had attacked a\r\nPrime Minister and a Duke. If he could only get all the publicans in\r\nLondon to take his paper because of his patriotic and bold conduct,\r\nthe fortune of the paper would be made. There is no better trade\r\nthan that of martyrdom, if the would-be martyr knows how far he may\r\njudiciously go, and in what direction. All this Mr. Quintus Slide was\r\nsupposed to have considered very well.\r\n\r\nAnd Phineas Finn knew that his enemy had also considered the nature\r\nof the matters which he would have been able to drag into Court if\r\nthere should be a trial. Allusions, very strong allusions, had been\r\nmade to former periods of Mr. Finn\'s life. And though there was\r\nbut little, if anything, in the past circumstances of which he was\r\nashamed,--but little, if anything, which he thought would subject him\r\npersonally to the odium of good men, could they be made accurately\r\nknown in all their details,--it would, he was well aware, be\r\nimpossible that such accuracy should be achieved. And the story if\r\ntold inaccurately would not suit him. And then, there was a reason\r\nagainst any public proceeding much stronger even than this. Whether\r\nthe telling of the story would or would not suit him, it certainly\r\nwould not suit others. As has been before remarked, there are former\r\nchronicles respecting Phineas Finn, and in them may be found adequate\r\ncause for this conviction on his part. To no outsider was this\r\nhistory known better than to Mr. Quintus Slide, and therefore Mr.\r\nQuintus Slide could dare almost to defy the law.\r\n\r\nBut not the less on this account were there many who told Phineas\r\nthat he ought to bring the action. Among these none were more eager\r\nthan his old friend Lord Chiltern, the Master of the Brake hounds,\r\na man who really loved Phineas, who also loved the abstract idea of\r\njustice, and who could not endure the thought that a miscreant should\r\ngo unpunished. Hunting was over for the season in the Brake country,\r\nand Lord Chiltern rushed up to London, having this object among\r\nothers of a very pressing nature on his mind. His saddler had to\r\nbe seen,--and threatened,--on a certain matter touching the horses\'\r\nbacks. A draught of hounds were being sent down to a friend in\r\nScotland. And there was a Committee of Masters to sit on a moot\r\nquestion concerning a neutral covert in the XXX country, of which\r\nCommittee he was one. But the desire to punish Slide was almost as\r\nstrong in his indignant mind as those other matters referring more\r\nespecially to the profession of his life. "Phineas," he said, "you\r\nare bound to do it. If you will allow a fellow like that to say such\r\nthings of you, why, by heaven, any man may say anything of anybody."\r\n\r\nNow Phineas could hardly explain to Lord Chiltern his objection to\r\nthe proposed action. A lady was closely concerned, and that lady was\r\nLord Chiltern\'s sister. "I certainly shall not," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"Just because he wishes me to do it. I should be falling into the\r\nlittle pit that he has dug for me."\r\n\r\n"He couldn\'t hurt you. What have you got to be afraid of? Ruat\r\ncoelum."\r\n\r\n"There are certain angels, Chiltern, living up in that heaven which\r\nyou wish me to pull about our ears, as to whom, if all their heart\r\nand all their wishes and all their doings could be known, nothing but\r\npraise could be spoken; but who would still be dragged with soiled\r\nwings through the dirt if this man were empowered to bring witness\r\nafter witness into court. My wife would be named. For aught I know,\r\nyour wife."\r\n\r\n"By G----, he\'d find himself wrong there."\r\n\r\n"Leave a chimney-sweep alone when you see him, Chiltern. Should\r\nhe run against you, then remember that it is one of the necessary\r\npenalties of clean linen that it is apt to be soiled."\r\n\r\n"I\'m d----d if I\'d let him off."\r\n\r\n"Yes you would, old fellow. When you come to see clearly what you\r\nwould gain and what you would lose, you would not meddle with him."\r\n\r\nHis wife was at first inclined to think that an action should be\r\ntaken, but she was more easily convinced than Lord Chiltern. "I had\r\nnot thought," she said, "of poor Lady Laura. But is it not horrible\r\nthat a man should be able to go on like that, and that there should\r\nbe no punishment?" In answer to this he only shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest pressure came upon him from another source. He did\r\nnot in truth suffer much himself from what was said in the "People\'s\r\nBanner." He had become used to the "People\'s Banner" and had found\r\nout that in no relation of life was he less pleasantly situated\r\nbecause of the maledictions heaped upon him in the columns of that\r\nnewspaper. His position in public life did not seem to be weakened by\r\nthem. His personal friends did not fall off because of them. Those\r\nwho loved him did not love him less. It had not been so with him\r\nalways, but now, at last, he was hardened against Mr. Quintus Slide.\r\nBut the poor Duke was by no means equally strong. This attack upon\r\nhim, this denunciation of his cruelty, this assurance that he had\r\ncaused the death of Ferdinand Lopez, was very grievous to him. It\r\nwas not that he really felt himself to be guilty of the man\'s blood,\r\nbut that any one should say that he was guilty. It was of no use to\r\npoint out to him that other newspapers had sufficiently vindicated\r\nhis conduct in that respect, that it was already publicly known\r\nthat Lopez had received payment for those election expenses from\r\nMr. Wharton before the application had been made to him, and that\r\ntherefore the man\'s dishonesty was patent to all the world. It was\r\nequally futile to explain to him that the man\'s last act had been in\r\nno degree caused by what had been said in Parliament, but had been\r\nthe result of his continued failures in life and final absolute ruin.\r\nHe fretted and fumed and was very wretched,--and at last expressed\r\nhis opinion that legal steps should be taken to punish the "People\'s\r\nBanner." Now it had been already acknowledged, on the dictum of no\r\nless a man than Sir Gregory Grogram, the Attorney-General, that the\r\naction for libel, if taken at all, must be taken, not on the part of\r\nthe Prime Minister, but on that of Phineas Finn. Sir Timothy Beeswax\r\nhad indeed doubted, but it had come to be understood by all the\r\nmembers of the Coalition that Sir Timothy Beeswax always did doubt\r\nwhatever was said by Sir Gregory Grogram. "The Duke thinks that\r\nsomething should be done," said Mr. Warburton, the Duke\'s private\r\nSecretary, to Phineas Finn.\r\n\r\n"Not by me, I hope," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"Nobody else can do it. That is to say it must be done in your name.\r\nOf course it would be a Government matter, as far as expense goes,\r\nand all that."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry the Duke should think so."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that it could hurt you."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry the Duke should think so," repeated Phineas,--"because\r\nnothing can be done in my name. I have made up my mind about it.\r\nI think the Duke is wrong in wishing it, and I believe that were\r\nany action taken, we should only be playing into the hands of that\r\nwretched fellow, Quintus Slide. I have long been conversant with\r\nMr. Quintus Slide, and have quite made up my mind that I will never\r\nplay upon his pipe. And you may tell the Duke that there are other\r\nreasons. The man has referred to my past life, and in seeking to\r\njustify those remarks he would be enabled to drag before the public\r\ncircumstances and stories, and perhaps persons, in a manner that I\r\npersonally should disregard, but which, for the sake of others, I am\r\nbound to prevent. You will explain all this to the Duke?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid you will find the Duke very urgent."\r\n\r\n"I must then express my great sorrow that I cannot oblige the Duke. I\r\ntrust I need hardly say that the Duke has no colleague more devoted\r\nto his interest than I am. Were he to wish me to change my office, or\r\nto abandon it, or to undertake any political duty within the compass\r\nof my small powers, he would find me ready to obey his behests. But\r\nin this matter others are concerned, and I cannot make my judgment\r\nsubordinate to his." The private Secretary looked very serious, and\r\nsimply said that he would do his best to explain these objections to\r\nhis Grace.\r\n\r\nThat the Duke would take his refusal in bad part Phineas felt nearly\r\ncertain. He had been a little surprised at the coldness of the\r\nMinister\'s manner to him after the statement he had made in the\r\nhouse, and had mentioned the matter to his wife. "You hardly know\r\nhim," she had said, "as well as I do."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. You ought to know him very intimately, and I have had\r\nbut little personal friendship with him. But it was a moment in which\r\nthe man might, for the moment, have been cordial."\r\n\r\n"It was not a moment for his cordiality. The Duchess says that if you\r\nwant to get a really genial smile from him you must talk to him about\r\ncork soles. I know exactly what she means. He loves to be simple, but\r\nhe does not know how to show people that he likes it. Lady Rosina\r\nfound him out by accident."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t suppose that I am in the least aggrieved," he had said. And\r\nnow he spoke again to his wife in the same spirit. "Warburton clearly\r\nthinks that he will be offended, and Warburton, I suppose, knows his\r\nmind."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why he should. I have been reading it longer, and I\r\nstill find it very difficult. Lady Glen has been at the work for the\r\nlast fifteen years, and sometimes owns that there are passages she\r\nhas not mastered yet. I fancy Mr. Warburton is afraid of him, and is\r\na little given to fancy that everybody should bow down to him. Now if\r\nthere is anything certain about the Duke it is this,--that he doesn\'t\r\nwant any one to bow down to him. He hates all bowing down."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he loves those who oppose him."\r\n\r\n"It is not the opposition he hates, but the cause in the man\'s mind\r\nwhich may produce it. When Sir Orlando opposed him, and he thought\r\nthat Sir Orlando\'s opposition was founded on jealousy, then he\r\ndespised Sir Orlando. But had he believed in Sir Orlando\'s belief in\r\nthe new ships, he would have been capable of pressing Sir Orlando to\r\nhis bosom, although he might have been forced to oppose Sir Orlando\'s\r\nships in the Cabinet."\r\n\r\n"He is a Sir Bayard to you," said Phineas, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Rather a Don Quixote, whom I take to have been the better man of the\r\ntwo. I\'ll tell you what he is, Phineas, and how he is better than\r\nall the real knights of whom I have ever read in story. He is a man\r\naltogether without guile, and entirely devoted to his country. Do not\r\nquarrel with him, if you can help it."\r\n\r\nPhineas had not the slightest desire to quarrel with his chief; but\r\nhe did think it to be not improbable that his chief would quarrel\r\nwith him. It was notorious to him as a member of the Cabinet,--as a\r\ncolleague living with other colleagues by whom the Prime Minister was\r\ncoddled, and especially as the husband of his wife, who lived almost\r\ncontinually with the Prime Minister\'s wife,--that the Duke was cut\r\nto the quick by the accusation that he had hounded Ferdinand Lopez\r\nto his death. The Prime Minister had defended himself in the House\r\nagainst the first charge by means of Phineas Finn, and now required\r\nPhineas to defend him from the second charge in another way. This\r\nhe was obliged to refuse to do. And then the Minister\'s private\r\nSecretary looked very grave, and left him with the impression that\r\nthe Duke would be much annoyed, if not offended. And already there\r\nhad grown up an idea that the Duke would have on the list of his\r\ncolleagues none who were personally disagreeable to himself. Though\r\nhe was by no means a strong Minister in regard to political measures,\r\nor the proper dominion of his party, still men were afraid of him.\r\nIt was not that he would call upon them to resign, but that, if\r\naggrieved, he would resign himself. Sir Orlando Drought had rebelled\r\nand had tried a fall with the Prime Minister,--and had greatly\r\nfailed. Phineas determined that if frowned upon he would resign,\r\nbut that he certainly would bring no action for libel against the\r\n"People\'s Banner."\r\n\r\nA week passed after he had seen Warburton before he by chance found\r\nhimself alone with the Prime Minister. This occurred at the house\r\nin Carlton Gardens, at which he was a frequent visitor,--and could\r\nhardly have ceased to be so without being noticed, as his wife spent\r\nhalf her time there. It was evident to him then that the occasion was\r\nsought for by the Duke. "Mr. Finn," said the Duke, "I wanted to have\r\na word or two with you."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Phineas, arresting his steps.\r\n\r\n"Warburton spoke to you about that--that newspaper."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Duke. He seemed to think that there should be an action for\r\nlibel."\r\n\r\n"I thought so too. It was very bad, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--it was bad. I have known the \'People\'s Banner\' for some time,\r\nand it is always bad."\r\n\r\n"No doubt;--no doubt. It is bad, very bad. Is it not sad that there\r\nshould be such dishonesty, and that nothing can be done to stop it?\r\nWarburton says that you won\'t hear of an action in your name."\r\n\r\n"There are reasons, Duke."\r\n\r\n"No doubt;--no doubt. Well;--there\'s an end of it. I own I think the\r\nman should be punished. I am not often vindictive, but I think that\r\nhe should be punished. However, I suppose it cannot be."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see the way."\r\n\r\n"So be it. So be it. It must be entirely for you to judge. Are you\r\nnot longing to get into the country, Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly yet," said Phineas, surprised. "It\'s only June, and we have\r\ntwo months more of it. What is the use of longing yet?"\r\n\r\n"Two months more!" said the Duke. "Two months certainly. But even two\r\nmonths will come to an end. We go down to Matching quietly,--very\r\nquietly,--when the time does come. You must promise that you\'ll come\r\nwith us. Eh? I make a point of it, Mr. Finn."\r\n\r\nPhineas did promise, and thought that he had succeeded in mastering\r\none of the difficult passages in that book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\nThe Duchess and Her Friend\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the Duke, though he was by far too magnanimous to be angry with\r\nPhineas Finn because Phineas would not fall into his views respecting\r\nthe proposed action, was not the less tormented and goaded by what\r\nthe newspaper said. The assertion that he had hounded Ferdinand Lopez\r\nto his death, that by his defence of himself he had brought the man\'s\r\nblood on his head, was made and repeated till those around him did\r\nnot dare to mention the name of Lopez in his hearing. Even his wife\r\nwas restrained and became fearful, and in her heart of hearts began\r\nalmost to wish for that retirement to which he had occasionally\r\nalluded as a distant Elysium which he should never be allowed to\r\nreach. He was beginning to have the worn look of an old man. His\r\nscanty hair was turning grey, and his long thin cheeks longer and\r\nthinner. Of what he did when sitting alone in his chamber, either at\r\nhome or at the Treasury Chamber, she knew less and less from day to\r\nday, and she began to think that much of his sorrow arose from the\r\nfact that among them they would allow him to do nothing. There was no\r\nspecial subject now which stirred him to eagerness and brought upon\r\nherself explanations which were tedious and unintelligible to her,\r\nbut evidently delightful to him. There were no quints or semi-tenths\r\nnow, no aspirations for decimal perfection, no delightfully fatiguing\r\nhours spent in the manipulation of the multiplication table. And she\r\ncould not but observe that the old Duke now spoke to her much less\r\nfrequently of her husband\'s political position than had been his\r\nhabit. Through the first year and a half of the present ministerial\r\narrangement he had been constant in his advice to her, and had\r\nalways, even when things were difficult, been cheery and full of\r\nhope. He still came frequently to the house, but did not often\r\nsee her. And when he did see her he seemed to avoid all allusion\r\neither to the political successes or the political reverses of the\r\nCoalition. And even her other special allies seemed to labour under\r\nunusual restraint with her. Barrington Erle seldom told her any news.\r\nMr. Rattler never had a word for her. Warburton, who had ever been\r\ndiscreet, became almost petrified by discretion. And even Phineas\r\nFinn had grown to be solemn, silent, and uncommunicative. "Have you\r\nheard who is the new Prime Minister?" she said to Mrs. Finn one day.\r\n\r\n"Has there been a change?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. Everything has become so quiet that I cannot imagine\r\nthat Plantagenet is still in office. Do you know what anybody is\r\ndoing?"\r\n\r\n"The world is going on very smoothly, I take it."\r\n\r\n"I hate smoothness. It always means treachery and danger. I feel sure\r\nthat there will be a great blow up before long. I smell it in the\r\nair. Don\'t you tremble for your husband?"\r\n\r\n"Why should I? He likes being in office because it gives him\r\nsomething to do; but he would never be an idle man. As long as he has\r\na seat in Parliament, I shall be contented."\r\n\r\n"To have been Prime Minister is something after all, and they can\'t\r\nrob him of that," said the Duchess, recurring again to her own\r\nhusband. "I half fancy sometimes that the charm of the thing is\r\ngrowing upon him."\r\n\r\n"Upon the Duke?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He is always talking of the delight he will have in giving\r\nit up. He is always Cincinnatus, going back to his peaches and his\r\nploughs. But I fear he is beginning to feel that the salt would be\r\ngone out of his life if he ceased to be the first man in the kingdom.\r\nHe has never said so, but there is a nervousness about him when I\r\nsuggest to him the name of this or that man as his successor which\r\nalarms me. And I think he is becoming a tyrant with his own men. He\r\nspoke the other day of Lord Drummond almost as though he meant to\r\nhave him whipped. It isn\'t what one expected from him;--is it?"\r\n\r\n"The weight of the load on his mind makes him irritable."\r\n\r\n"Either that, or having no load. If he had really much to do he\r\nwouldn\'t surely have time to think so much of that poor wretch who\r\ndestroyed himself. Such sensitiveness is simply a disease. One can\r\nnever punish any fault in the world if the sinner can revenge himself\r\nupon us by rushing into eternity. Sometimes I see him shiver and\r\nshudder, and then I know that he is thinking of Lopez."\r\n\r\n"I can understand all that, Lady Glen."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t as it should be, though you can understand it. I\'ll bet you\r\na guinea that Sir Timothy Beeswax has to go out before the beginning\r\nof next Session."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no objection. But why Sir Timothy?"\r\n\r\n"He mentioned Lopez\' name the other day before Plantagenet. I heard\r\nhim. Plantagenet pulled that long face of his, looking as though he\r\nmeant to impose silence on the whole world for the next six weeks.\r\nBut Sir Timothy is brass itself, a sounding cymbal of brass that\r\nnothing can silence. He went on to declare with that loud voice\r\nof his that the death of Lopez was a good riddance of bad rubbish.\r\nPlantagenet turned away and left the room and shut himself up. He\r\ndidn\'t declare to himself that he\'d dismiss Sir Timothy, because\r\nthat\'s not the way of his mind. But you\'ll see that Sir Timothy will\r\nhave to go."\r\n\r\n"That, at any rate, will be a good riddance of bad rubbish," said\r\nMrs. Finn, who did not love Sir Timothy Beeswax.\r\n\r\nSoon after that the Duchess made up her mind that she would\r\ninterrogate the Duke of St. Bungay as to the present state of\r\naffairs. It was then the end of June, and nearly one of those long\r\nand tedious months had gone by of which the Duke spoke so feelingly\r\nwhen he asked Phineas Finn to come down to Matching. Hope had been\r\nexpressed in more than one quarter that this would be a short\r\nSession. Such hopes are much more common in June than in July, and,\r\nthough rarely verified, serve to keep up the drooping spirits of\r\nlanguid senators. "I suppose we shall be early out of town, Duke,"\r\nshe said one day.\r\n\r\n"I think so. I don\'t see what there is to keep us. It often happens\r\nthat ministers are a great deal better in the country than in London,\r\nand I fancy it will be so this year."\r\n\r\n"You never think of the poor girls who haven\'t got their husbands\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"They should make better use of their time. Besides, they can get\r\ntheir husbands in the country."\r\n\r\n"It\'s quite true that they never get to the end of their labours.\r\nThey are not like you members of Parliament who can shut up your\r\nportfolios and go and shoot grouse. They have to keep at their work\r\nspring and summer, autumn and winter,--year after year! How they must\r\nhate the men they persecute!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think we can put off going for their sake."\r\n\r\n"Men are always selfish, I know. What do you think of Plantagenet\r\nlately?" The question was put very abruptly, without a moment\'s\r\nnotice, and there was no avoiding it.\r\n\r\n"Think of him!"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--what do you think of his condition;--of his happiness, his\r\nhealth, his capacity of endurance? Will he be able to go on much\r\nlonger? Now, my dear Duke, don\'t stare at me like that. You know, and\r\nI know, that you haven\'t spoken a word to me for the last two months.\r\nAnd you know, and I know, how many things there are of which we are\r\nboth thinking in common. You haven\'t quarrelled with Plantagenet?"\r\n\r\n"Quarrelled with him! Good heavens, no."\r\n\r\n"Of course I know you still call him your noble colleague, and your\r\nnoble friend, and make one of the same team with him and all that.\r\nBut it used to be so much more than that."\r\n\r\n"It is still more than that;--very much more."\r\n\r\n"It was you who made him Prime Minister."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no;--and again no. He made himself Prime Minister by\r\nobtaining the confidence of the House of Commons. There is no other\r\npossible way in which a man can become Prime Minister in this\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"If I were not very serious at this moment, Duke, I should make an\r\nallusion to the--Marines." No other human being could have said\r\nthis to the Duke of St. Bungay, except the young woman whom he had\r\npetted all his life as Lady Glencora. "But I am very serious," she\r\ncontinued, "and I may say not very happy. Of course the big wigs of\r\na party have to settle among themselves who shall be their leader,\r\nand when this party was formed they settled, at your advice, that\r\nPlantagenet should be the man."\r\n\r\n"My dear Lady Glen, I cannot allow that to pass without\r\ncontradiction."\r\n\r\n"Do not suppose that I am finding fault, or even that I am\r\nungrateful. No one rejoiced as I rejoiced. No one still feels so much\r\npride in it as I feel. I would have given ten years of my life to\r\nmake him Prime Minister, and now I would give five to keep him so. It\r\nis like it was to be king, when men struggled among themselves who\r\nshould be king. Whatever he may be, I am ambitious. I love to think\r\nthat other men should look to him as being above them, and that\r\nsomething of this should come down upon me as his wife. I do not know\r\nwhether it was not the happiest moment of my life when he told me\r\nthat the Queen had sent for him."\r\n\r\n"It was not so with him."\r\n\r\n"No, Duke,--no! He and I are very different. He only wants to be\r\nuseful. At any rate, that was all he did want."\r\n\r\n"He is still the same."\r\n\r\n"A man cannot always be carrying a huge load up a hill without having\r\nhis back bent."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that the load need be so heavy, Duchess."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but what is the load? It is not going to the Treasury Chambers\r\nat eleven or twelve in the morning, and sitting four or five times a\r\nweek in the House of Lords till seven or eight o\'clock. He was never\r\nill when he would remain in the House of Commons till two in the\r\nmorning, and not have a decent dinner above twice in the week. The\r\nload I speak of isn\'t work."\r\n\r\n"What is it then?" said the Duke, who in truth understood it all\r\nnearly as well as the Duchess herself.\r\n\r\n"It is hard to explain, but it is very heavy."\r\n\r\n"Responsibility, my dear, will always be heavy."\r\n\r\n"But it is hardly that;--certainly not that alone. It is the feeling\r\nthat so many people blame him for so many things, and the doubt in\r\nhis own mind whether he may not deserve it. And then he becomes\r\nfretful, and conscious that such fretfulness is beneath him and\r\ninjurious to his honour. He condemns men in his mind, and condemns\r\nhimself for condescending to condemn them. He spends one quarter of\r\nan hour in thinking that as he is Prime Minister he will be Prime\r\nMinister down to his fingers\' ends, and the next in resolving that he\r\nnever ought to have been Prime Minister at all." Here something like\r\na frown passed across the old man\'s brow, which was, however, no\r\nindication, of anger. "Dear Duke," she said, "you must not be angry\r\nwith me. Who is there to whom I can speak but you?"\r\n\r\n"Angry, my dear! No, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Because you looked as though you would scold me." At this he smiled.\r\n"And of course all this tells upon his health."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he is ill?"\r\n\r\n"He never says so. There is no special illness. But he is thin and\r\nwan and careworn. He does not eat and he does not sleep. Of course I\r\nwatch him."\r\n\r\n"Does his doctor see him?"\r\n\r\n"Never. When I asked him once to say a word to Sir James Thorax,--for\r\nhe was getting hoarse, you know,--he only shook his head and turned\r\non his heels. When he was in the other House, and speaking every\r\nnight, he would see Thorax constantly, and do just what he was told.\r\nHe used to like opening his mouth and having Sir James to look down\r\nit. But now he won\'t let any one touch him."\r\n\r\n"What would you have me do, Lady Glen?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that he is so far out of health that he ought to give\r\nit up?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that. I don\'t dare to say it. I don\'t dare to recommend\r\nanything. No consideration of health would tell with him at all. If\r\nhe were to die to-morrow as the penalty of doing something useful\r\nto-night, he wouldn\'t think twice about it. If you wanted to make\r\nhim stay where he is, the way to do it would be to tell him that his\r\nhealth was failing him. I don\'t know that he does want to give up\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"The autumn months will do everything for him;--only let him be\r\nquiet."\r\n\r\n"You are coming to Matching, Duke?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so,--if you ask me,--for a week or two."\r\n\r\n"You must come. I am quite nervous if you desert us. I think he\r\nbecomes more estranged every day from all the others. I know you\r\nwon\'t do a mischief by repeating what I say."\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"He seems to me to turn his nose up at everybody. He used to like Mr.\r\nMonk; but he envies Mr. Monk, because Mr. Monk is Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. I asked him whether we shouldn\'t have Lord Drummond at\r\nMatching, and he told me angrily that I might ask all the Government\r\nif I liked."\r\n\r\n"Drummond contradicted him the other day."\r\n\r\n"I knew there was something. He has got to be like a bear with a sore\r\nhead, Duke. You should have seen his face the other day, when Mr.\r\nRattler made some suggestion to him about the proper way of dividing\r\nfarms."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he ever liked Rattler."\r\n\r\n"What of that? Don\'t I have to smile upon men whom I hate like\r\npoison;--and women too, which is worse? Do you think that I love old\r\nLady Ramsden, or Mrs. MacPherson? He used to be so fond of Lord\r\nCantrip."\r\n\r\n"I think he likes Lord Cantrip," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"He asked his lordship to do something, and Lord Cantrip declined."\r\n\r\n"I know all about that," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"And now he looks gloomy at Lord Cantrip. His friends won\'t stand\r\nthat kind of thing, you know, for ever."\r\n\r\n"He is always courteous to Finn," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--just now he is on good terms with Mr. Finn. He would never be\r\nharsh to Mr. Finn, because he knows that Mrs. Finn is the one really\r\nintimate female friend whom I have in the world. After all, Duke,\r\nbesides Plantagenet and the children, there are only two persons in\r\nthe world whom I really love. There are only you and she. She will\r\nnever desert me;--and you must not desert me either." Then he put his\r\nhand behind her waist, and stooped over her and kissed her brow, and\r\nswore to her that he would never desert her.\r\n\r\nBut what was he to do? He knew, without being told by the Duchess,\r\nthat his colleague and chief was becoming, from day to day, more\r\ndifficult to manage. He had been right enough in laying it down as a\r\ngeneral rule that Prime Ministers are selected for that position by\r\nthe general confidence of the House of Commons;--but he was aware\r\nat the same time that it had hardly been so in the present instance.\r\nThere had come to be a dead-lock in affairs, during which neither\r\nof the two old and well-recognised leaders of parties could command\r\na sufficient following for the carrying on of the Government. With\r\nunusual patience these two gentlemen had now for the greater part\r\nof three Sessions sat by, offering but little opposition to the\r\nCoalition, but of course biding their time. They, too, called\r\nthemselves,--perhaps thought themselves,--Cincinnatuses. But their\r\nploughs and peaches did not suffice to them, and they longed again to\r\nbe in every mouth, and to have, if not their deeds, then even their\r\nomissions blazoned in every paragraph. The palate accustomed to\r\nCayenne pepper can hardly be gratified by simple salt. When that\r\ndead-lock had come, politicians who were really anxious for the\r\ncountry had been forced to look about for a Premier,--and in the\r\nsearch the old Duke had been the foremost. The Duchess had hardly\r\nsaid more than the truth when she declared that her husband\'s\r\npromotion had been effected by their old friend. But it is sometimes\r\neasier to make than to unmake. Perhaps the time had now in truth\r\ncome, in which it would be better for the country that the usual\r\nstate of things should again exist. Perhaps,--nay, the Duke now\r\nthought that he saw that it was so,--Mr. Gresham might again have a\r\nLiberal majority at his back if the Duke of Omnium could find some\r\ngraceful mode of retiring. But who was to tell all this to the Duke\r\nof Omnium? There was only one man in all England to whom such a task\r\nwas possible, and that was the old Duke himself,--who during the last\r\ntwo years had been constantly urgent with his friend not to retire!\r\nHow often since he had taken office had the conscientious and timid\r\nMinister begged of his friend permission to abandon his high office!\r\nBut that permission had always been refused, and now, for the last\r\nthree months, the request had not been repeated. The Duchess probably\r\nwas right in saying that her husband "didn\'t want to give it up now."\r\n\r\nBut he, the Duke of St. Bungay, had brought his friend into the\r\ntrouble, and it was certainly his duty to extricate him from it. The\r\nadmonition might come in the rude shape of repeated minorities in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Hitherto the number of votes at the command of the\r\nMinistry had not been very much impaired. A few always fall off as\r\ntime goes on. Aristides becomes too just, and the mind of man is\r\ngreedy of novelty. Sir Orlando, also, had taken with him a few, and\r\nit may be that two or three had told themselves that there could not\r\nbe all that smoke raised by the "People\'s Banner" without some fire\r\nbelow it. But there was a good working majority,--very much at Mr.\r\nMonk\'s command,--and Mr. Monk was moved by none of that feeling of\r\nrebellion which had urged Sir Orlando on to his destruction. It was\r\ndifficult to find a cause for resignation. And yet the Duke of St.\r\nBungay, who had watched the House of Commons closely for nearly half\r\na century, was aware that the Coalition which he had created had done\r\nits work, and was almost convinced that it would not be permitted to\r\nremain very much longer in power. He had seen symptoms of impatience\r\nin Mr. Daubeny, and Mr. Gresham had snorted once or twice, as though\r\neager for the battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV\r\n\r\nThe New K.G.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in June had died the Marquis of Mount Fidgett. In all England\r\nthere was no older family than that of the Fichy Fidgetts, whose\r\nbaronial castle of Fichy Fellows is still kept up, the glory of\r\narchaeologists and the charm of tourists. Some people declare it to\r\nbe the most perfect castle residence in the country. It is admitted\r\nto have been completed in the time of Edward VI, and is thought to\r\nhave been commenced in the days of Edward I. It has always belonged\r\nto the Fichy Fidgett family, who with a persistence that is becoming\r\nrarer every day, has clung to every acre that it ever owned, and has\r\nadded acre to acre in every age. The consequence has been that the\r\nexisting Marquis of Mount Fidgett has always been possessed of great\r\nterritorial influence, and has been flattered, cajoled, and revered\r\nby one Prime Minister after another. Now the late Marquis had been,\r\nas was the custom with the Fichy Fidgetts, a man of pleasure. If the\r\ntruth may be spoken openly, it should be admitted that he had been\r\na man of sin. The duty of keeping together the family property he\r\nhad performed with a perfect zeal. It had always been acknowledged\r\non behalf of the existing Marquis, that in whatever manner he might\r\nspend his money, however base might be the gullies into which his\r\nwealth descended, he never spent more than he had to spend. Perhaps\r\nthere was but little praise in this, as he could hardly have\r\ngot beyond his enormous income unless he had thrown it away on\r\nrace-courses and roulette tables. But it had long been remarked of\r\nthe Mount Fidgett marquises that they were too wise to gamble. The\r\nfamily had not been an honour to the country, but had nevertheless\r\nbeen honoured by the country. The man who had just died had perhaps\r\nbeen as selfish and as sensual a brute as had ever disgraced\r\nhumanity;--but nevertheless he had been a Knight of the Garter. He\r\nhad been possessed of considerable parliamentary interest, and the\r\nPrime Minister of the day had not dared not to make him a Knight of\r\nthe Garter. All the Marquises of Mount Fidgett had for many years\r\npast been Knights of the Garter. On the last occasion a good deal had\r\nbeen said about it. A feeling had even then begun to prevail that\r\nthe highest personal honour in the gift of the Crown should not be\r\nbestowed upon a man whose whole life was a disgrace, and who did\r\nindeed seem to deserve every punishment which human or divine wrath\r\ncould inflict. He had a large family, but they were all illegitimate.\r\nWives generally he liked, but of his own wife he very soon broke\r\nthe heart. Of all the companies with which he consorted he was the\r\nadmitted king, but his subjects could do no man any honour. The\r\nCastle of Fichy Fellows was visited by the world at large, but no\r\nman or woman with a character to lose went into any house really\r\ninhabited by the Marquis. And yet he had become a Knight of the\r\nGarter, and was therefore, presumably, one of those noble Englishmen\r\nto whom the majesty of the day was willing to confide the honour,\r\nand glory, and safety of the Crown. There were many who disliked\r\nthis. That a base reprobate should become a Marquis and a peer of\r\nParliament was in accordance with the constitution of the country.\r\nMarquises and peers are not as a rule reprobates, and the misfortune\r\nwas one which could not be avoided. He might have ill-used his own\r\nwife and other wives\' husbands without special remark, had he not\r\nbeen made a Knight of the Garter. The Minister of the day, however,\r\nhad known the value of the man\'s support, and, being thick-skinned,\r\nhad lived through the reproaches uttered without much damage to\r\nhimself. Now the wicked Marquis was dead, and it was the privilege\r\nand the duty of the Duke of Omnium to select another Knight.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal said about it at the time. There was a\r\nrumour,--no doubt a false rumour,--that the Crown insisted in this\r\ninstance on dictating a choice to the Duke of Omnium. But even were\r\nit so, the Duke could not have been very much aggrieved, as the\r\nchoice dictated was supposed to be that of himself. The late Duke\r\nhad been a Knight, and when he had died, it was thought that his\r\nsuccessor would succeed also to the ribbon. The new Duke had been at\r\nthat time in the Cabinet, and had remained there, but had accepted\r\nan office inferior in rank to that which he had formerly filled.\r\nThe whole history of these things has been written, and may be read\r\nby the curious. The Duchess, newly a duchess then and very keen in\r\nreference to her husband\'s rank, had instigated him to demand the\r\nribbon as his right. This he had not only declined to do, but had\r\ngone out of the way to say that he thought it should be bestowed\r\nelsewhere. It had been bestowed elsewhere, and there had been a\r\nvery general feeling that he had been passed over because his easy\r\ntemperament in such matters had been seen and utilised. Now, whether\r\nthe Crown interfered or not,--a matter on which no one short of\r\na writer of newspaper articles dares to make a suggestion till\r\ntime shall have made mellow the doings of sovereigns and their\r\nministers,--the suggestion was made. The Duke of St. Bungay ventured\r\nto say to his friend that no other selection was possible.\r\n\r\n"Recommend her Majesty to give it to myself!" said the Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n"You will find it to be her Majesty\'s wish. It has been very common.\r\nSir Robert Walpole had it."\r\n\r\n"I am not Sir Robert Walpole." The Duke named other examples of Prime\r\nMinisters who had been gartered by themselves. But our Prime Minister\r\ndeclared it to be out of the question. No honour of that description\r\nshould be conferred upon him as long as he held his present position.\r\nThe old Duke was much in earnest, and there was a great deal said on\r\nthe subject,--but at last it became clear, not only to him, but to\r\nthe members of the Cabinet generally, and then to the outside world,\r\nthat the Prime Minister would not consent to accept the vacant\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a month after this the question subsided. A Minister is\r\nnot bound to bestow a Garter the day after it becomes vacant. There\r\nare other Knights to guard the throne, and one may be spared for\r\na short interval. But during that interval many eyes were turned\r\ntowards the stall in St. George\'s Chapel. A good thing should be\r\ngiven away like a clap of thunder if envy, hatred, and malice are\r\nto be avoided. A broad blue ribbon across the chest is of all\r\ndecorations the most becoming, or, at any rate, the most desired. And\r\nthere was, I fear, an impression on the minds of some men that the\r\nDuke in such matters was weak and might be persuaded. Then there came\r\nto him an application in the form of a letter from the new Marquis\r\nof Mount Fidgett,--a man whom he had never seen, and of whom he had\r\nnever heard. The new Marquis had hitherto resided in Italy, and\r\nmen only knew of him that he was odious to his uncle. But he had\r\ninherited all the Fichy Fidgett estates, and was now possessed of\r\nimmense wealth and great honour. He ventured, he said, to represent\r\nto the Prime Minister that for generations past the Marquises of\r\nMount Fidgett had been honoured by the Garter. His political status\r\nin the country was exactly that enjoyed by his late uncle; but he\r\nintended that his political career should be very different. He was\r\nquite prepared to support the Coalition. "What is he that he should\r\nexpect to be made a Knight of the Garter?" said our Duke to the old\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n"He is the Marquis of Mount Fidgett, and next to yourself, perhaps,\r\nthe richest peer of Great Britain."\r\n\r\n"Have riches anything to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"Something certainly. You would not name a pauper peer."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--if he was a man whose career had been highly honourable to\r\nthe country. Such a man, of course, could not be a pauper, but I do\r\nnot think his want of wealth should stand in the way of his being\r\nhonoured by the Garter."\r\n\r\n"Wealth, rank, and territorial influence have been generally thought\r\nto have something to do with it."\r\n\r\n"And character nothing!"\r\n\r\n"My dear Duke, I have not said so."\r\n\r\n"Something very much like it, my friend, if you advocate the claim of\r\nthe Marquis of Mount Fidgett. Did you approve of the selection of the\r\nlate Marquis?"\r\n\r\n"I was in the Cabinet at the time, and will therefore say nothing\r\nagainst it. But I have never heard anything against this man\'s\r\ncharacter."\r\n\r\n"Nor in favour of it. To my thinking he has as much claim, and no\r\nmore, as that man who just opened the door. He was never seen in the\r\nLower House."\r\n\r\n"Surely that cannot signify."\r\n\r\n"You think, then, that he should have it?"\r\n\r\n"You know what I think," said the elder statesman thoughtfully.\r\n"In my opinion there is no doubt that you would best consult the\r\nhonour of the country by allowing her Majesty to bestow this act of\r\ngrace upon a subject who has deserved so well from her Majesty as\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"It is quite impossible."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said the Duke, not appearing to notice the refusal\r\nof his friend, "that in this peculiar position you should allow\r\nyourself to be persuaded to lay aside your own feeling. No man of\r\nhigh character is desirous of securing to himself decorations which\r\nhe may bestow upon others."\r\n\r\n"Just so."\r\n\r\n"But here the decoration bestowed upon the chief whom we all follow,\r\nwould confer a wider honour upon many than it could do if given to\r\nany one else."\r\n\r\n"The same may be said of any Prime Minister."\r\n\r\n"Not so. A commoner, without high permanent rank or large fortune, is\r\nnot lowered in the world\'s esteem by not being of the Order. You will\r\npermit me to say--that a Duke of Omnium has not reached that position\r\nwhich he ought to enjoy unless he be a Knight of the Garter." It\r\nmust be borne in mind that the old Duke, who used this argument, had\r\nhimself worn the ribbon for the last thirty years. "But if--"\r\n\r\n"Well;--well."\r\n\r\n"But if you are,--I must call it obstinate."\r\n\r\n"I am obstinate in that respect."\r\n\r\n"Then," said the Duke of St. Bungay, "I should recommend her Majesty\r\nto give it to the Marquis."\r\n\r\n"Never," said the Prime Minister, with very unaccustomed energy. "I\r\nwill never sanction the payment of such a price for services which\r\nshould never be bought or sold."\r\n\r\n"It would give no offence."\r\n\r\n"That is not enough, my friend. Here is a man of whom I only know\r\nthat he has bought a great many marble statues. He has done nothing\r\nfor his country, and nothing for his sovereign."\r\n\r\n"If you are determined to look to what you call desert alone, I would\r\nname Lord Drummond." The Prime Minister frowned and looked unhappy.\r\nIt was quite true that Lord Drummond had contradicted him, and that\r\nhe had felt the injury grievously. "Lord Drummond has been very true\r\nto us."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--true to us! What is that?"\r\n\r\n"He is in every respect a man of character, and well looked upon\r\nin the country. There would be some enmity and a good deal of\r\nenvy--which might be avoided by either of the courses I have\r\nproposed; but those courses you will not take. I take it for granted\r\nthat you are anxious to secure the support of those who generally act\r\nwith Lord Drummond."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I am." The old Duke shrugged his shoulders. "What\r\nI mean is, that I do not think that we ought to pay an increased\r\nprice for their support. His lordship is very well as the Head of\r\nan Office; but he is not nearly so great a man as my friend Lord\r\nCantrip."\r\n\r\n"Cantrip would not join us. There is no evil in politics so great\r\nas that of seeming to buy the men who will not come without buying.\r\nThese rewards are fairly given for political support."\r\n\r\n"I had not, in truth, thought of Lord Cantrip."\r\n\r\n"He does not expect it any more than my butler."\r\n\r\n"I only named him as having a claim stronger than any that Lord\r\nDrummond can put forward. I have a man in my mind to whom I think\r\nsuch an honour is fairly due. What do you say to Lord Earlybird?"\r\nThe old Duke opened his mouth and lifted up his hands in unaffected\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Earlybird was an old man of a very peculiar character. He\r\nhad never opened his mouth in the House of Lords and had never sat\r\nin the House of Commons. The political world knew him not at all. He\r\nhad a house in town, but very rarely lived there. Early Park, in the\r\nparish of Bird, had been his residence since he first came to the\r\ntitle forty years ago, and had been the scene of all his labours.\r\nHe was a nobleman possessed of a moderate fortune, and, as men said\r\nof him, of a moderate intellect. He had married early in life and\r\nwas blessed with a large family. But he had certainly not been an\r\nidle man. For nearly half a century he had devoted himself to the\r\nimprovement of the labouring classes, especially in reference to\r\ntheir abodes and education, and had gradually, without any desire on\r\nhis own part, worked himself up into public notice. He was not an\r\neloquent man, but he would take the chair at meeting after meeting,\r\nand sit with admirable patience for long hours to hear the eloquence\r\nof others. He was a man very simple in his tastes, and had brought up\r\nhis family to follow his habits. He had therefore been able to do\r\nmunificent things with moderate means, and in the long course of\r\nyears had failed in hiding his munificence from the public. Lord\r\nEarlybird, till after middle life, had not been much considered, but\r\ngradually there had grown up a feeling that there were not very many\r\nbetter men in the country. He was a fat, bald-headed old man, who was\r\nalways pulling his spectacles on and off, nearly blind, very awkward,\r\nand altogether indifferent to appearance. Probably he had no more\r\nidea of the Garter in his own mind than he had of a Cardinal\'s hat.\r\nBut he had grown into fame, and had not escaped the notice of the\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n"Do you know anything against Lord Earlybird?" asked the Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n"Certainly nothing against him, Duke."\r\n\r\n"Nor anything in his favour?"\r\n\r\n"I know him very well,--I think I may say intimately. There isn\'t a\r\nbetter man breathing."\r\n\r\n"An honour to the peerage!" said the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n"An honour to humanity rather," said the other, "as being of all men\r\nthe least selfish and most philanthropical."\r\n\r\n"What more can be said of a man?"\r\n\r\n"But according to my view he is not the sort of person whom one would\r\nwish to see made a Knight of the Garter. If he had the ribbon he\r\nwould never wear it."\r\n\r\n"The honour surely does not consist in its outward sign. I am\r\nentitled to wear some kind of coronet, but I do not walk about with\r\nit on my head. He is a man of a great heart and of many virtues.\r\nSurely the country, and her Majesty on behalf of the country, should\r\ndelight to honour such a man."\r\n\r\n"I really doubt whether you look at the matter in the right light,"\r\nsaid the ancient statesman, who was in truth frightened at what was\r\nbeing proposed. "You must not be angry with me if I speak plainly."\r\n\r\n"My friend, I do not think that it is within your power to make me\r\nangry."\r\n\r\n"Well then,--I will get you for a moment to listen to my view on\r\nthe matter. There are certain great prizes in the gift of the Crown\r\nand of the Ministers of the Crown,--the greatest of which are now\r\ntraditionally at the disposal of the Prime Minister. These are always\r\ngiven to party friends. I may perhaps agree with you that party\r\nsupport should not be looked to alone. Let us acknowledge that\r\ncharacter and services should be taken into account. But the very\r\ntheory of our Government will be overset by a reversal of the rule\r\nwhich I have attempted to describe. You will offend all your own\r\nfriends, and only incur the ridicule of your opponents. It is no\r\ndoubt desirable that the high seats of the country should be filled\r\nby men of both parties. I would not wish to see every Lord-Lieutenant\r\nof a county a Whig." In his enthusiasm the old Duke went back to his\r\nold phraseology. "But I know that my opponents when their turn comes\r\nwill appoint their friends to the Lieutenancies, and that so the\r\nbalance will be maintained. If you or I appoint their friends, they\r\nwon\'t appoint ours. Lord Earlybird\'s proxy has been in the hands of\r\nthe Conservative Leader of the House of Lords ever since he succeeded\r\nhis father." Then the old man paused, but his friend waited to listen\r\nwhether the lecture were finished before he spoke, and the Duke of\r\nSt. Bungay continued. "And, moreover, though Lord Earlybird is a very\r\ngood man,--so much so that many of us may well envy him,--he is not\r\njust the man fitted for this destination. A Knight of the Garter\r\nshould be a man prone to show himself, a public man, one whose work\r\nin the country has brought him face to face with his fellows. There\r\nis an aptness, a propriety, a fitness in these things which one can\r\nunderstand perhaps better than explain."\r\n\r\n"Those fitnesses and aptnesses change, I think, from day to day.\r\nThere was a time when a knight should be a fighting man."\r\n\r\n"That has gone by."\r\n\r\n"And the aptnesses and fitnesses in accordance with which the\r\nsovereign of the day was induced to grace with the Garter such a man\r\nas the late Marquis of Mount Fidgett have, I hope, gone by. You will\r\nadmit that?"\r\n\r\n"There is no such man proposed."\r\n\r\n"And other fitnesses and aptnesses will go by, till the time will\r\ncome when the man to be selected as Lieutenant of a county will be\r\nthe man whose selection will be most beneficial to the county, and\r\nKnights of the Garter will be chosen for their real virtues."\r\n\r\n"I think you are Quixotic. A Prime Minister is of all men bound to\r\nfollow the traditions of his country, or, when he leaves them, to\r\nleave them with very gradual steps."\r\n\r\n"And if he break that law and throw over all that thraldom;--what\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"He will lose the confidence which has made him what he is."\r\n\r\n"It is well that I know the penalty. It is hardly heavy enough to\r\nenforce strict obedience. As for the matter in dispute, it had better\r\nstand over yet for a few days." When the Prime Minister said this the\r\nold Duke knew very well that he intended to have his own way.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was. A week passed by, and then the younger Duke wrote\r\nto the elder Duke saying that he had given to the matter all the\r\nconsideration in his power, and that he had at last resolved to\r\nrecommend her Majesty to bestow the ribbon on Lord Earlybird. He\r\nwould not, however, take any step for a few days so that his friend\r\nmight have an opportunity of making further remonstrance if he\r\npleased. No further remonstrance was made, and Lord Earlybird, much\r\nto his own amazement, was nominated to the vacant Garter.\r\n\r\nThe appointment was one certainly not popular with any of the Prime\r\nMinister\'s friends. With some, such as Lord Drummond, it indicated\r\na determination on the part of the Duke to declare his freedom from\r\nall those bonds which had hitherto been binding on the Heads of\r\nGovernment. Had the Duke selected himself, certainly no offence would\r\nhave been given. Had the Marquis of Mount Fidgett been the happy\r\nman, excuses would have been made. But it was unpardonable to Lord\r\nDrummond that he should have been passed over and that the Garter\r\nshould have been given to Lord Earlybird. To the poor old Duke the\r\noffence was of a different nature. He had intended to use a very\r\nstrong word when he told his friend that his proposed conduct would\r\nbe Quixotic. The Duke of Omnium would surely know that the Duke of\r\nSt. Bungay could not support a Quixotic Prime Minister. And yet the\r\nyounger Duke, the Telemachus of the last two years,--after hearing\r\nthat word,--had rebelled against his Mentor, and had obstinately\r\nadhered to his Quixotism! The greed of power had fallen upon the\r\nman,--so said the dear old Duke to himself,--and the man\'s fall was\r\ncertain. Alas, alas; had he been allowed to go before the poison had\r\nentered his veins, how much less would have been his suffering!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV\r\n\r\n"There Must Be Time"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third week in July, when the Session was still\r\nsitting, and when no day had been absolutely as yet fixed for the\r\nescape of members, Mr. Wharton received a letter from his friend\r\nArthur Fletcher which certainly surprised him very much, and which\r\nleft him for a day or two unable to decide what answer ought to be\r\ngiven. It will be remembered that Ferdinand Lopez destroyed himself\r\nin March, now three months since. The act had been more than a nine\r\ndays\' wonder, having been kept in the memory of many men by the\r\nsedulous efforts of Quintus Slide, and by the fact that the name of\r\nso great a man as the Prime Minister was concerned in the matter. But\r\ngradually the feeling about Ferdinand Lopez had died away, and his\r\nfate, though it had outlived the nominal nine days, had sunk into\r\ngeneral oblivion before the end of the ninth week. The Prime Minister\r\nhad not forgotten the man, nor had Quintus Slide. The name was\r\nstill common in the columns of the "People\'s Banner," and was never\r\nmentioned without being read by the unfortunate Duke. But others had\r\nceased to talk of Ferdinand Lopez.\r\n\r\nTo the mind, however, of Arthur Fletcher the fact of the man\'s\r\ndeath was always present. A dreadful incubus had come upon his life,\r\nblighting all his prospects, obscuring all his sun by a great cloud,\r\ncovering up all his hopes, and changing for him all his outlook into\r\nthe world. It was not only that Emily Wharton should not have become\r\nhis wife, but that the woman whom he loved with so perfect a love\r\nshould have been sacrificed to so vile a creature as this man. He\r\nnever blamed her,--but looked upon his fate as Fate. Then on a sudden\r\nhe heard that the incubus was removed. The man who had made him and\r\nher wretched had by a sudden stroke been taken away and annihilated.\r\nThere was nothing now between him and her,--but a memory. He could\r\ncertainly forgive, if she could forget.\r\n\r\nOf course he had felt at the first moment that time must pass by. He\r\nhad become certain that her mad love for the man had perished. He\r\nhad been made sure that she had repented her own deed in sackcloth\r\nand ashes. It had been acknowledged to him by her father that she\r\nhad been anxious to be separated from her husband, if her husband\r\nwould consent to such a separation. And then, remembering as he did\r\nhis last interview with her, having in his mind as he did every\r\ncircumstance of that caress which he had given her,--down to the\r\nvery quiver of the fingers he had pressed,--he could not but flatter\r\nhimself that at last he had touched her heart. But there must be\r\ntime! The conventions of the world operate on all hearts, especially\r\non the female heart, and teach that new vows, too quickly given, are\r\ndisgraceful. The world has seemed to decide that a widow should take\r\ntwo years before she can bestow herself on a second man without a\r\ntouch of scandal. But the two years is to include everything, the\r\ncourtship of the second as well as the burial of the first,--and\r\nnot only the courtship, but the preparation of the dresses and the\r\nwedding itself. And then this case was different from all others. Of\r\ncourse there must be time, but surely not here a full period of two\r\nyears! Why should the life of two young persons be so wasted, if it\r\nwere the case that they loved each other? There was horror here,\r\nremorse, pity, perhaps pardon; but there was no love,--none of that\r\nlove which is always for a time increased in its fervour by the loss\r\nof the loved object; none of that passionate devotion which must at\r\nfirst make the very idea of another man\'s love intolerable. There\r\nhad been a great escape,--an escape which could not but be inwardly\r\nacknowledged, however little prone the tongue might be to confess it.\r\nOf course there must be time;--but how much time? He argued it in his\r\nmind daily, and at each daily argument the time considered by him to\r\nbe appropriate was shortened. Three months had passed and he had not\r\nyet seen her. He had resolved that he would not even attempt to see\r\nher till her father should consent. But surely a period had passed\r\nsufficient to justify him in applying for that permission. And then\r\nhe bethought himself that it would be best in applying for that\r\npermission to tell everything to Mr. Wharton. He well knew that\r\nhe would be telling no secret. Mr. Wharton knew the state of his\r\nfeelings as well as he knew it himself. If ever there was a case in\r\nwhich time might be abridged, this was one; and therefore he wrote\r\nhis letter,--as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   3, ---- Court, Temple, 24th July, 187--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. WHARTON,\r\n\r\n   It is a matter of great regret to me that we should see\r\n   so little of each other,--and especially of regret that I\r\n   should never now see Emily.\r\n\r\n   I may as well rush into the matter at once. Of course this\r\n   letter will not be shown to her, and therefore I may write\r\n   as I would speak if I were with you. The wretched man whom\r\n   she married is gone, and my love for her is the same as\r\n   it was before she had ever seen him, and as it has always\r\n   been from that day to this. I could not address you\r\n   or even think of her as yet, did I not know that that\r\n   marriage had been unfortunate. But it has not altered her\r\n   to me in the least. It has been a dreadful trouble to us\r\n   all,--to her, to you, to me, and to all connected with us.\r\n   But it is over, and I think that it should be looked back\r\n   upon as a black chasm which we have bridged and got over,\r\n   and to which we need never cast back our eyes.\r\n\r\n   I have no right to think that, though she might some day\r\n   love another man, she would, therefore, love me; but I\r\n   think that I have a right to try, and I know that I should\r\n   have your good-will. It is a question of time, but if I\r\n   let time go by, some one else may slip in. Who can tell?\r\n   I would not be thought to press indecently, but I do feel\r\n   that here the ordinary rules which govern men and women\r\n   are not to be followed. He made her unhappy almost from\r\n   the first day. She had made a mistake which you and she\r\n   and all acknowledged. She has been punished; and so have\r\n   I,--very severely I can assure you. Wouldn\'t it be a good\r\n   thing to bring all this to an end as soon as possible,--if\r\n   it can be brought to an end in the way I want?\r\n\r\n   Pray tell me what you think. I would propose that you\r\n   should ask her to see me, and then say just as much as you\r\n   please. Of course I should not press her at first. You\r\n   might ask me to dinner, and all that kind of thing, and so\r\n   she would get used to me. It is not as though we had not\r\n   been very, very old friends. But I know you will do the\r\n   best. I have put off writing to you till I sometimes think\r\n   that I shall go mad over it if I sit still any longer.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n   ARTHUR FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wharton got this letter he was very much puzzled. Could he\r\nhave had his wish, he too would have left the chasm behind him as\r\nproposed by his young friend, and have never cast an eye back upon\r\nthe frightful abyss. He would willingly have allowed the whole Lopez\r\nincident to be passed over as an episode in their lives, which, if it\r\ncould not be forgotten, should at any rate never be mentioned. They\r\nhad all been severely punished, as Fletcher had said, and if the\r\nmatter could end there he would be well content to bear on his own\r\nshoulders all that remained of that punishment, and to let everything\r\nbegin again. But he knew very well it could not be so with her. Even\r\nyet it was impossible to induce Emily to think of her husband without\r\nregret. It had been only too manifest during the last year of their\r\nmarried life that she had felt horror rather than love towards him.\r\nWhen there had been a question of his leaving her behind, should he\r\ngo to Central America, she had always expressed herself more than\r\nwilling to comply with such an arrangement. She would go with him\r\nshould he order her to do so, but would infinitely sooner remain\r\nin England. And then, too, she had spoken of him while alive with\r\ndisdain and disgust, and had submitted to hear her father describe\r\nhim as infamous. Her life had been one long misery, under which she\r\nhad seemed gradually to be perishing. Now she was relieved, and her\r\nhealth was re-established. A certain amount of unjoyous cheerfulness\r\nwas returning to her. It was impossible to doubt that she must have\r\nknown that a great burden had fallen from her back. And yet she would\r\nnever allow his name to be mentioned without giving some outward\r\nsign of affection for his memory. If he was bad, so were others bad.\r\nThere were many worse than he. Such were the excuses she made for\r\nher late husband. Old Mr. Wharton, who really thought that in all\r\nhis experience he had never known any one worse than his son-in-law,\r\nwould sometimes become testy, and at last resolved that he would\r\naltogether hold his tongue. But he could hardly hold his tongue now.\r\n\r\nHe, no doubt, had already formed his hopes in regard to Arthur\r\nFletcher. He had trusted that the man whom he had taught himself some\r\nyears since to regard as his wished-for son-in-law, might be constant\r\nand strong enough in his love to forget all that was past, and to be\r\nstill willing to redeem his daughter from misery. But as days had\r\ncrept on since the scene at the Tenway Junction, he had become aware\r\nthat time must do much before such relief would be accepted. It\r\nwas, however, still possible that the presence of the man might do\r\nsomething. Hitherto, since the deed had been done, no stranger had\r\ndined in Manchester Square. She herself had seen no visitor. She\r\nhad hardly left the house except to go to church, and then had been\r\nenveloped in the deepest crape. Once or twice she had allowed herself\r\nto be driven out in a carriage, and, when she had done so, her\r\nfather had always accompanied her. No widow, since the seclusion\r\nof widows was first ordained, had been more strict in maintaining\r\nthe restraints of widowhood as enjoined. How then could he bid\r\nher receive a new lover,--or how suggest to her that a lover was\r\npossible? And yet he did not like to answer Arthur Fletcher without\r\nnaming some period for the present mourning,--some time at which he\r\nmight at least show himself in Manchester Square.\r\n\r\n"I have had a letter from Arthur Fletcher," he said to his daughter a\r\nday or two after he had received it. He was sitting after dinner, and\r\nEverett was also in the room.\r\n\r\n"Is he in Herefordshire?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No;--he is up in town, attending to the House of Commons, I suppose.\r\nHe had something to say to me, and as we are not in the way of\r\nmeeting he wrote. He wants to come and see you."\r\n\r\n"Not yet, papa."\r\n\r\n"He talked of coming and dining here."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; pray let him come."\r\n\r\n"You would not mind that?"\r\n\r\n"I would dine early and be out of the way. I should be so glad if you\r\nwould have somebody sometimes. I shouldn\'t think then that I was such\r\na--such a restraint to you."\r\n\r\nBut this was not what Mr. Wharton desired. "I shouldn\'t like that, my\r\ndear. Of course he would know that you were in the house."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I think you might meet an old friend like that," said\r\nEverett.\r\n\r\nShe looked at her brother, and then at her father, and burst into\r\ntears. "Of course you shall not be pressed if it would be irksome to\r\nyou," said her father.\r\n\r\n"It is the first plunge that hurts," said Everett. "If you could once\r\nbring yourself to do it, you would find afterwards that you were more\r\ncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"Papa," she said slowly, "I know what it means. His goodness I shall\r\nalways remember. You may tell him I say so. But I cannot meet him\r\nyet." Then they pressed her no further. Of course she had understood.\r\nHer father could not even ask her to say a word which might give\r\ncomfort to Arthur as to some long distant time.\r\n\r\nHe went down to the House of Commons the next day, and saw his young\r\nfriend there. Then they walked up and down Westminster Hall for\r\nnearly an hour, talking over the matter with the most absolute\r\nfreedom. "It cannot be for the benefit of any one," said Arthur\r\nFletcher, "that she should immolate herself like an Indian\r\nwidow,--and for the sake of such a man as that! Of course I have no\r\nright to dictate to you,--hardly, perhaps, to give an opinion."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"It does seem to me, then, that you ought to force her out of that\r\nkind of thing. Why should she not go down to Herefordshire?"\r\n\r\n"In time, Arthur,--in time."\r\n\r\n"But people\'s lives are running away."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, if you were to see her you would know how vain it\r\nwould be to try to hurry her. There must be time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI\r\n\r\nThe End of the Session\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke of St. Bungay had been very much disappointed. He had\r\ncontradicted with a repetition of noes the assertion of the Duchess\r\nthat he had been the Warwick who had placed the Prime Minister\'s\r\ncrown on the head of the Duke of Omnium, but no doubt he felt in his\r\nheart that he had done so much towards it that his advice respecting\r\nthe vacant Garter, when given with so much weight, should have been\r\nfollowed. He was an old man, and had known the secrets of Cabinet\r\nCouncils when his younger friend was a little boy. He had given\r\nadvice to Lord John, and had been one of the first to congratulate\r\nSir Robert Peel when that statesman became a free-trader. He had sat\r\nin conclave with THE Duke, and had listened to the bold Liberalism\r\nof old Earl Grey, both in the Lower and the Upper House. He had\r\nbeen always great in council, never giving his advice unasked, nor\r\nthrowing his pearls before swine, and cautious at all times to avoid\r\nexcesses on this side or on that. He had never allowed himself a\r\nhobby horse of his own to ride, had never been ambitious, had never\r\nsought to be the ostensible leader of men. But he did now think that\r\nwhen, with all his experience, he spoke very much in earnest, some\r\nattention should be paid to what he said. When he had described a\r\ncertain line of conduct as Quixotic he had been very much in earnest.\r\nHe did not usually indulge in strong language, and Quixotic, when\r\napplied to the conduct of a Prime Minister, was, to his ideas, very\r\nstrong. The thing described as Quixotic had now been done, and the\r\nDuke of St. Bungay was a disappointed man.\r\n\r\nFor an hour or two he thought that he must gently secede from all\r\nprivate councils with the Prime Minister. To resign, or to put\r\nimpediments in the way of his own chief, did not belong to his\r\ncharacter. That line of strategy had come into fashion since he had\r\nlearnt his political rudiments, and was very odious to him. But in\r\nall party compacts there must be inner parties, peculiar bonds, and\r\nconfidences stricter, stronger, and also sweeter than those which\r\nbind together the twenty or thirty gentlemen who form a Government.\r\nFrom those closer ties which had hitherto bound him to the Duke of\r\nOmnium he thought, for a while, that he must divorce himself. Surely\r\non such a subject as the nomination of a Knight of the Garter his\r\nadvice might have been taken,--if only because it had come from him!\r\nAnd so he kept himself apart for a day or two, and even in the House\r\nof Lords ceased to whisper kindly, cheerful words into the ears of\r\nhis next neighbour.\r\n\r\nBut various remembrances crowded in upon him by degrees, compelling\r\nhim to moderate and at last to abandon his purpose. Among these the\r\nfirst was the memory of the kiss which he had given the Duchess. The\r\nwoman had told him that she loved him, that he was one of the very\r\nfew whom she did love,--and the word had gone straight into his old\r\nheart. She had bade him not to desert her; and he had not only given\r\nher his promise, but he had converted that promise to a sacred pledge\r\nby a kiss. He had known well why she had exacted the promise. The\r\nturmoil in her husband\'s mind, the agony which he sometimes endured\r\nwhen people spoke ill of him, the aversion which he had at first\r\ngenuinely felt to an office for which he hardly thought himself fit,\r\nand now the gradual love of power created by the exercise of power,\r\nhad all been seen by her, and had created that solicitude which had\r\ninduced her to ask for the promise. The old Duke had known them both\r\nwell, but had hardly as yet given the Duchess credit for so true a\r\ndevotion to her husband. It now seemed to him that though she had\r\nfailed to love the man, she had given her entire heart to the Prime\r\nMinister. He sympathised with her altogether, and, at any rate could\r\nnot go back from his promise.\r\n\r\nAnd then he remembered, too, that if this man did anything amiss in\r\nthe high office which he had been made to fill, he who had induced\r\nhim to fill it was responsible. What right had he, the Duke of St.\r\nBungay, to be angry because his friend was not all-wise at all\r\npoints? Let the Droughts and the Drummonds and the Beeswaxes\r\nquarrel among themselves or with their colleagues. He belonged to a\r\ndifferent school, in the teachings of which there was less perhaps\r\nof excitement and more of long-suffering;--but surely, also, more\r\nof nobility. He was, at any rate, too old to change, and he would\r\ntherefore be true to his friend through evil and through good. Having\r\nthought this all out he again whispered some cheery word to the Prime\r\nMinister, as they sat listening to the denunciations of Lord Fawn, a\r\nLiberal lord, much used to business, but who had not been received\r\ninto the Coalition. The first whisper and the second whisper the\r\nPrime Minister received very coldly. He had fully appreciated the\r\ndiscontinuance of the whispers, and was aware of the cause. He had\r\nmade a selection on his own unassisted judgment in opposition to his\r\nold friend\'s advice, and this was the result. Let it be so! All his\r\nfriends were turning away from him and he would have to stand alone.\r\nIf so, he would stand alone till the pendulum of the House of Commons\r\nhad told him that it was time for him to retire. But gradually the\r\ndetermined good-humour of the old man prevailed. "He has a wonderful\r\ngift of saying nothing with second-rate dignity," whispered the\r\nrepentant friend, speaking of Lord Fawn.\r\n\r\n"A very honest man," said the Prime Minister in return.\r\n\r\n"A sort of bastard honesty,--by precept out of stupidity. There is\r\nno real conviction in it, begotten by thought." This little bit of\r\ncriticism, harsh as it was, had the effect, and the Prime Minister\r\nbecame less miserable than he had been.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Drummond forgave nothing. He still held his office, but more\r\nthan once he was seen in private conference with both Sir Orlando and\r\nMr. Boffin. He did not attempt to conceal his anger. Lord Earlybird!\r\nAn old woman! One whom no other man in England would have thought\r\nof making a Knight of the Garter! It was not, he said, personal\r\ndisappointment in himself. There were half-a-dozen peers whom he\r\nwould willingly have seen so graced without the slightest chagrin.\r\nBut this must have been done simply to show the Duke\'s power, and to\r\nlet the world understand that he owed nothing and would pay nothing\r\nto his supporters. It was almost a disgrace, said Lord Drummond, to\r\nbelong to a Government the Head of which could so commit himself! The\r\nSession was nearly at an end, and Lord Drummond thought that no step\r\ncould be conveniently taken now. But it was quite clear to him that\r\nthis state of things could not be continued. It was observed that\r\nLord Drummond and the Prime Minister never spoke to each other in\r\nthe House, and that the Secretary of State for the Colonies,--that\r\nbeing the office which he held,--never rose in his place after Lord\r\nEarlybird\'s nomination, unless to say a word or two as to his own\r\npeculiar duties. It was very soon known to all the world that there\r\nwas war to the knife between Lord Drummond and the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nAnd, strange to say, there seemed to be some feeling of general\r\ndiscontent on this very trifling subject. When Aristides has been\r\nmuch too just the oyster-shells become numerous. It was said that the\r\nDuke had been guilty of pretentious love of virtue in taking Lord\r\nEarlybird out of his own path of life and forcing him to write K.G.\r\nafter his name. There came out an article, of course in the "People\'s\r\nBanner," headed, "Our Prime Minister\'s Good Works," in which poor\r\nLord Earlybird was ridiculed in a very unbecoming manner, and in\r\nwhich it was asserted that the thing was done as a counterpoise to\r\nthe iniquity displayed in "hounding Ferdinand Lopez to his death."\r\nWhenever Ferdinand Lopez was mentioned he had always been hounded.\r\nAnd then the article went on to declare that either the Prime\r\nMinister had quarrelled with all his colleagues, or else that all his\r\ncolleagues had quarrelled with the Prime Minister. Mr. Slide did not\r\ncare which it might be, but, whichever it might be, the poor country\r\nhad to suffer when such a state of things was permitted. It was\r\nnotorious that neither the Duke of St. Bungay nor Lord Drummond would\r\nnow even speak to their own chief, so thoroughly were they disgusted\r\nwith his conduct. Indeed it seemed that the only ally the Prime\r\nMinister had in his own Cabinet was the Irish adventurer, Mr.\r\nPhineas Finn. Lord Earlybird never read a word of all this, and was\r\naltogether undisturbed as he sat in his chair in Exeter Hall,--or\r\njust at this time of the year more frequently in the provinces. But\r\nthe Duke of Omnium read it all. After what had passed he did not dare\r\nto show it to his brother Duke. He did not dare to tell his friend\r\nthat it was said in the newspapers that they did not speak to each\r\nother. But every word from Mr. Slide\'s pen settled on his own memory,\r\nand added to his torments. It came to be a fixed idea in the Duke\'s\r\nmind that Mr. Slide was a gadfly sent to the earth for the express\r\npurpose of worrying him.\r\n\r\nAnd as a matter of course the Prime Minister in his own mind blamed\r\nhimself for what he had done. It is the chief torment of a person\r\nconstituted as he was that strong as may be the determination to do\r\na thing, fixed as may be the conviction that that thing ought to be\r\ndone, no sooner has it been perfected than the objections of others,\r\nwhich before had been inefficacious, become suddenly endowed with\r\ntruth and force. He did not like being told by Mr. Slide that he\r\nought not to have set his Cabinet against him, but when he had in\r\nfact done so, then he believed what Mr. Slide told him. As soon\r\nalmost as the irrevocable letter had been winged on its way to Lord\r\nEarlybird, he saw the absurdity of sending it. Who was he that he\r\nshould venture to set aside all the traditions of office? A Pitt or\r\na Peel or a Palmerston might have done so, because they had been\r\nabnormally strong. They had been Prime Ministers by the work of their\r\nown hands, holding their powers against the whole world. But he,--he\r\ntold himself daily that he was only there by sufferance, because at\r\nthe moment no one else could be found to take it. In such a condition\r\nshould he not have been bound by the traditions of office, bound\r\nby the advice of one so experienced and so true as the Duke of St.\r\nBungay? And for whom had he broken through these traditions and\r\nthrown away this advice? For a man who had no power whatever to help\r\nhim or any other Minister of the Crown;--for one whose every pursuit\r\nin life was at variance with the acquisition of such honours as that\r\nnow thrust upon him! He could see his own obstinacy, and could even\r\nhate the pretentious love of virtue which he had himself displayed.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Lord Earlybird with his ribbon?" his wife said to him.\r\n\r\n"I do not know Lord Earlybird by sight," he replied angrily.\r\n\r\n"Nor any one else either. But he would have come and shown himself to\r\nyou, if he had had a spark of gratitude in his composition. As far as\r\nI can learn you have sacrificed the Ministry for his sake."\r\n\r\n"I did my duty as best I knew how to do it," said the Duke, almost\r\nwith ferocity, "and it little becomes you to taunt me with any\r\ndeficiency."\r\n\r\n"Plantagenet!"\r\n\r\n"I am driven," he said, "almost beyond myself, and it kills me when\r\nyou take part against me."\r\n\r\n"Take part against you! Surely there was very little in what I said."\r\nAnd yet, as she spoke, she repented bitterly that she had at the\r\nmoment allowed herself to relapse into the sort of badinage which\r\nhad been usual with her before she had understood the extent of his\r\nsufferings. "If I trouble you by what I say, I will certainly hold my\r\ntongue."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t repeat to me what that man says in the newspaper."\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t regard the man, Plantagenet. You shouldn\'t allow the\r\npaper to come into your hands."\r\n\r\n"Am I to be afraid of seeing what men say of me? Never! But you need\r\nnot repeat it, at any rate if it be false." She had not seen the\r\narticle in question or she certainly would not have repeated the\r\naccusation which it contained. "I have quarrelled with no colleague.\r\nIf such a one as Lord Drummond chooses to think himself injured, am\r\nI to stoop to him? Nothing strikes me so much in all this as the\r\nill-nature of the world at large. When they used to bait a bear tied\r\nto a stake, every one around would cheer the dogs and help to torment\r\nthe helpless animal. It is much the same now, only they have a man\r\ninstead of a bear for their pleasure."\r\n\r\n"I will never help the dogs again," she said, coming up to him and\r\nclinging within the embrace of his arm.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he had been Quixotic, and he would sit in his chair\r\nrepeating the word to himself aloud, till he himself began to fear\r\nthat he would do it in company. But the thing had been done and\r\ncould not be undone. He had had the bestowal of one Garter, and he\r\nhad given it to Lord Earlybird! It was,--he told himself, but not\r\ncorrectly,--the only thing that he had done on his own undivided\r\nresponsibility since he had been Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe last days of July had passed, and it had been at last decided\r\nthat the Session should close on the 11th of August. Now the 11th\r\nof August was thought to be a great deal too near the 12th to allow\r\nof such an arrangement being considered satisfactory. A great many\r\nmembers were very angry at the arrangement. It had been said all\r\nthrough June and into July that it was to be an early Session, and\r\nyet things had been so mismanaged that when the end came everything\r\ncould not be finished without keeping members of Parliament in town\r\nup to the 11th of August! In the memory of present legislators there\r\nhad never been anything so awkward. The fault, if there was a fault,\r\nwas attributable to Mr. Monk. In all probability the delay was\r\nunavoidable. A minister cannot control long-winded gentlemen, and\r\nwhen gentlemen are very long-winded there must be delay. No doubt a\r\nstrong minister can exercise some control, and it is certain that\r\nlong-winded gentlemen find an unusual scope for their breath when the\r\nreigning dynasty is weak. In that way Mr. Monk and the Duke may have\r\nbeen responsible, but they were blamed as though they, for their own\r\nspecial amusement, detained gentlemen in town. Indeed the gentlemen\r\nwere not detained. They grumbled and growled and then fled,--but\r\ntheir grumblings and growlings were heard even after their departure.\r\n\r\n"Well;--what do you think of it all?" the Duke said one day to Mr.\r\nMonk, at the Treasury, affecting an air of cheery good-humour.\r\n\r\n"I think," said Mr. Monk, "that the country is very prosperous.\r\nI don\'t know that I ever remember trade to have been more evenly\r\nsatisfactory."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. That\'s very well for the country, and ought, I suppose, to\r\nsatisfy us."\r\n\r\n"It satisfies me," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"And me, in a way. But if you were walking about in a very tight pair\r\nof boots, in an agony with your feet, would you be able just then to\r\nrelish the news that agricultural wages in that parish had gone up\r\nsixpence a week?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d take my boots off, and then try," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I\'m thinking of doing. If I had my boots off all\r\nthat prosperity would be so pleasant to me! But you see you can\'t\r\ntake your boots off in company. And it may be that you have a walk\r\nbefore you, and that no boots will be worse for your feet even than\r\ntight ones."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have our boots off soon, Duke," said Mr. Monk, speaking of the\r\nrecess.\r\n\r\n"And when shall we be quit of them altogether? Joking apart, they\r\nhave to be worn if the country requires it."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Duke."\r\n\r\n"And it may be that you and I think that upon the whole they may be\r\nworn with advantage. What does the country say to that?"\r\n\r\n"The country has never said the reverse. We have not had a majority\r\nagainst us this Session on any Government question."\r\n\r\n"But we have had narrowing majorities. What will the House do as\r\nto the Lords\' amendments on the Bankruptcy Bill?" There was a Bill\r\nthat had gone down from the House of Commons, but had not originated\r\nwith the Government. It had, however, been fostered by Ministers in\r\nthe House of Lords, and had been sent back with certain amendments\r\nfor which the Lord Chancellor had made himself responsible. It was\r\ntherefore now almost a Government measure. The manipulation of this\r\nmeasure had been one of the causes of the prolonged sitting of the\r\nHouses.\r\n\r\n"Grogram says they will take the amendments."\r\n\r\n"And if they don\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Why then," said Mr. Monk, "the Lords must take our rejection."\r\n\r\n"And we shall have been beaten," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly."\r\n\r\n"And beaten simply because the House desires to beat us. I am told\r\nthat Sir Timothy Beeswax intends to speak and vote against the\r\namendments."\r\n\r\n"What,--Sir Timothy on one side, and Sir Gregory on the other?"\r\n\r\n"So Lord Ramsden tells me," said the Duke. "If it be so, what are we\r\nto do?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not go out in August," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the consideration of the Lords\' amendments\r\nin the House of Commons,--and it did not come till the 8th of\r\nAugust,--the matter was exactly as the Duke had said. Sir Gregory\r\nGrogram, with a great deal of earnestness, supported the Lords\'\r\namendment,--as he was in honour bound to do. The amendment had come\r\nfrom his chief, the Lord Chancellor, and had indeed been discussed\r\nwith Sir Gregory before it had been proposed. He was very much in\r\nearnest;--but it was evident from Sir Gregory\'s earnestness that\r\nhe expected a violent opposition. Immediately after him rose Sir\r\nTimothy. Now Sir Timothy was a pretentious man, who assumed to be not\r\nonly an advocate but a lawyer. And he assumed also to be a political\r\nmagnate. He went into the matter at great length. He began by saying\r\nthat it was not a party question. The Bill, which he had had the\r\nhonour of supporting before it went from their own House, had been\r\na private Bill. As such it had received a general support from the\r\nGovernment. It had been materially altered in the other House under\r\nthe auspices of his noble friend on the woolsack, but from those\r\nalterations he was obliged to dissent. Then he said some very heavy\r\nthings against the Lord Chancellor, and increased in acerbity as\r\nhe described what he called the altered mind of his honourable\r\nand learned friend the Attorney-General. He then made some very\r\nuncomplimentary allusions to the Prime Minister, whom he accused\r\nof being more than ordinarily reserved with his subordinates. The\r\nspeech was manifestly arranged and delivered with the express view of\r\ndamaging the Coalition, of which at the time he himself made a part.\r\nMen observed that things were very much altered when such a course as\r\nthat was taken in the House of Commons. But that was the course taken\r\non this occasion by Sir Timothy Beeswax, and was so far taken with\r\nsuccess that the Lords\' amendments were rejected and the Government\r\nwas beaten in a thin House, by a large majority,--composed partly of\r\nits own men. "What am I to do?" asked the Prime Minister of the old\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\nThe old Duke\'s answer was exactly the same as that given by Mr. Monk.\r\n"We cannot resign in August." And then he went on. "We must wait\r\nand see how things go at the beginning of next Session. The chief\r\nquestion is whether Sir Timothy should not be asked to resign."\r\n\r\nThen the Session was at an end, and they who had been staunch to the\r\nlast got out of town as quick as the trains could carry them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\nMrs. Lopez Prepares to Move\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Omnium was not the most discreet woman in the world.\r\nThat was admitted by her best friends, and was the great sin alleged\r\nagainst her by her worst enemies. In her desire to say sharp things,\r\nshe would say the sharp thing in the wrong place, and in her wish to\r\nbe good-natured she was apt to run into offences. Just as she was\r\nabout to leave town, which did not take place for some days after\r\nParliament had risen, she made an indiscreet proposition to her\r\nhusband. "Should you mind my asking Mrs. Lopez down to Matching? We\r\nshall only be a very small party."\r\n\r\nNow the very name of Lopez was terrible to the Duke\'s ears. Anything\r\nwhich recalled the wretch and that wretched tragedy to the Duke\'s\r\nmind gave him a stab. The Duchess ought to have felt that any\r\ncommunication between her husband and even the man\'s widow was to be\r\navoided rather than sought. "Quite out of the question!" said the\r\nDuke, drawing himself up.\r\n\r\n"Why out of the question?"\r\n\r\n"There are a thousand reasons. I could not have it."\r\n\r\n"Then I will say nothing more about it. But there is a romance\r\nthere,--something quite touching."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that she has--a lover?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--yes."\r\n\r\n"And she lost her husband only the other day,--lost him in so\r\nterrible a manner! If that is so, certainly I do not wish to see her\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is because you don\'t know the story."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wish to know it."\r\n\r\n"The man who now wants to marry her knew her long before she had\r\nseen Lopez, and had offered to her ever so many times. He is a fine\r\nfellow, and you know him."\r\n\r\n"I had rather not hear any more about it," said the Duke, walking\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThere was an end to the Duchess\'s scheme of getting Emily down to\r\nMatching,--a scheme which could hardly have been successful even had\r\nthe Duke not objected to it. But yet the Duchess would not abandon\r\nher project of befriending the widow. She had injured Lopez. She had\r\nliked what she had seen of Mrs. Lopez. And she was now endeavouring\r\nto take Arthur Fletcher by the hand. She called therefore at\r\nManchester Square on the day before she started for Matching, and\r\nleft a card and a note. This was on the 15th of August, when London\r\nwas as empty as it ever is. The streets at the West End were\r\ndeserted. The houses were shut up. The very sweepers of the crossings\r\nseemed to have gone out of town. The public offices were manned by\r\none or two unfortunates each, who consoled themselves by reading\r\nnovels at their desks. Half the cab-drivers had gone apparently to\r\nthe seaside,--or to bed. The shops were still open, but all the\r\nrespectable shopkeepers were either in Switzerland or at their marine\r\nvillas. The travelling world had divided itself into Cookites and\r\nHookites;--those who escaped trouble under the auspices of Mr. Cook,\r\nand those who boldly combated the extortions of foreign innkeepers\r\nand the anti-Anglican tendencies of foreign railway officials "on\r\ntheir own hooks." The Duchess of Omnium was nevertheless in town, and\r\nthe Duke might still be seen going in at the back entrance of the\r\nTreasury Chambers every day at eleven o\'clock. Mr. Warburton thought\r\nit very hard, for he, too, could shoot grouse; but he would have\r\nperished rather than have spoken a word.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess did not ask to see Mrs. Lopez, but left her card and a\r\nnote. She had not liked, she said, to leave town without calling,\r\nthough she would not seek to be admitted. She hoped that Mrs. Lopez\r\nwas recovering her health, and trusted that on her return to town she\r\nmight be allowed to renew her acquaintance. The note was very simple,\r\nand could not be taken as other than friendly. If she had been\r\nsimply Mrs. Palliser, and her husband had been a junior clerk in\r\nthe Treasury, such a visit would have been a courtesy; and it was\r\nnot less so because it was made by the Duchess of Omnium and by\r\nthe wife of the Prime Minister. But yet among all the poor widow\'s\r\nacquaintances she was the only one who had ventured to call since\r\nLopez had destroyed himself. Mrs. Roby had been told not to come.\r\nLady Eustace had been sternly rejected. Even old Mrs. Fletcher when\r\nshe had been up in town had, after a very solemn meeting with Mr.\r\nWharton, contented herself with sending her love. It had come to pass\r\nthat the idea of being immured was growing to be natural to Emily\r\nherself. The longer that it was continued the more did it seem to be\r\nimpossible to her that she should break from her seclusion. But yet\r\nshe was gratified by the note from the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"She means to be civil, papa."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--but there are people whose civility I don\'t want."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. I did not want the civility of that horrid Lady Eustace.\r\nBut I can understand this. She thinks that she did Ferdinand an\r\ninjury."\r\n\r\n"When you begin, my dear,--and I hope it will be soon,--to get back\r\nto the world, you will find it more comfortable, I think, to find\r\nyourself among your own people."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to go back," she said, sobbing bitterly.\r\n\r\n"But I want you to go back. All who know you want you to go back.\r\nOnly don\'t begin at that end."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t suppose, papa, that I wish to go to the Duchess?"\r\n\r\n"I wish you to go somewhere. It can\'t be good for you to remain here.\r\nIndeed I shall think it wicked, or at any rate weak, if you continue\r\nto seclude yourself."\r\n\r\n"Where shall I go?" she said, imploringly.\r\n\r\n"To Wharton. I certainly think you ought to go there first."\r\n\r\n"If you would go, papa, and leave me here,--just this once. Next year\r\nI will go,--if they ask me."\r\n\r\n"When I may be dead, for aught that any of us know."\r\n\r\n"Do not say that, papa. Of course any one may die."\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall not go without you. You may take that as certain.\r\nIs it likely that I should leave you alone in August and September in\r\nthis great gloomy house? If you stay, I shall stay." Now this meant\r\na great deal more than it had meant in former years. Since Lopez\r\nhad died Mr. Wharton had not once dined at the Eldon. He came home\r\nregularly at six o\'clock, sat with his daughter an hour before\r\ndinner, and then remained with her all the evening. It seemed as\r\nthough he were determined to force her out of her solitude by her\r\nnatural consideration for him. She would implore him to go to his\r\nclub and have his rubber, but he would never give way. No;--he didn\'t\r\ncare for the Eldon, and disliked whist. So he said. Till at last he\r\nspoke more plainly. "You are dull enough here all day, and I will not\r\nleave you in the evenings." There was a pertinacious tenderness in\r\nthis which she had not expected from the antecedents of his life.\r\nWhen, therefore, he told her that he would not go into the country\r\nwithout her, she felt herself almost constrained to yield.\r\n\r\nAnd she would have yielded at once but for one fear. How could she\r\ninsure to herself that Arthur Fletcher should not be there? Of course\r\nhe would be at Longbarns, and how could she prevent his coming over\r\nfrom Longbarns to Wharton? She could hardly bring herself to ask the\r\nquestion of her father. But she felt an insuperable objection to\r\nfinding herself in Arthur\'s presence. Of course she loved him. Of\r\ncourse in all the world he was of all the dearest to her. Of course\r\nif she could wipe out the past as with a wet towel, if she could put\r\nthe crape off her mind as well as from her limbs, she would become\r\nhis wife with the greatest joy. But the very feeling that she loved\r\nhim was disgraceful to her in her own thoughts. She had allowed\r\nhis caress while Lopez was still her husband,--the husband who had\r\nill-used her and betrayed her, who had sought to drag her down to his\r\nown depth of baseness. But now she could not endure to think that\r\nthat other man should even touch her. It was forbidden to her, she\r\nbelieved, by all the canons of womanhood even to think of love again.\r\nThere ought to be nothing left for her but crape and weepers. She had\r\ndone it all by her own obstinacy, and she could make no compensation\r\neither to her family, or to the world, or to her own feelings, but by\r\ndrinking the cup of her misery down to the very dregs. Even to think\r\nof joy would in her be a treason. On that occasion she did not yield\r\nto her father, conquering him as she had conquered him before by the\r\npleading of her looks rather than of her words.\r\n\r\nBut a day or two afterwards he came to her with arguments of a very\r\ndifferent kind. He at any rate must go to Wharton immediately, in\r\nreference to a letter of vital importance which he had received\r\nfrom Sir Alured. The reader may perhaps remember that Sir Alured\'s\r\nheir,--the heir to the title and property,--was a nephew for whom he\r\nentertained no affection whatever. This Wharton had been discarded by\r\nall the Whartons as a profligate drunkard. Some years ago Sir Alured\r\nhad endeavoured to reclaim the man, and had spent perhaps more money\r\nthan he had been justified in doing in the endeavour, seeing that,\r\nas present occupier of the property, he was bound to provide for\r\nhis own daughters, and that at his death every acre must go to this\r\nne\'er-do-well. The money had been allowed to flow like water for a\r\ntwelvemonth, and had done no good whatever. There had then been no\r\nhope. The man was strong and likely to live,--and after a while\r\nmarried a wife, some woman that he took from the very streets. This\r\nhad been his last known achievement, and from that moment not even\r\nhad his name been mentioned at Wharton. Now there came the tidings of\r\nhis death. It was said that he had perished in some attempt to cross\r\nsome glaciers in Switzerland;--but by degrees it appeared that the\r\nglacier itself had been less dangerous than the brandy which he had\r\nswallowed whilst on his journey. At any rate he was dead. As to that\r\nSir Alured\'s letter was certain. And he was equally certain that he\r\nhad left no son.\r\n\r\nThese tidings were quite as important to Mr. Wharton as to Sir\r\nAlured,--more important to Everett Wharton than to either of them, as\r\nhe would inherit all after the death of those two old men. At this\r\nmoment he was away yachting with a friend, and even his address was\r\nunknown. Letters for him were to be sent to Oban, and might, or might\r\nnot, reach him in the course of a month. But in a man of Sir Alured\'s\r\nfeelings, this catastrophe produced a great change. The heir to his\r\ntitle and property was one whom he was bound to regard with affection\r\nand almost with reverence,--if it were only possible for him to do\r\nso. With his late heir it had been impossible. But Everett Wharton he\r\nhad always liked. Everett had not been quite all that his father and\r\nuncle had wished. But his faults had been exactly those which would\r\nbe cured,--or would almost be made virtues,--by the possession of\r\na title and property. Distaste for a profession and aptitude for\r\nParliament would become a young man who was heir not only to the\r\nWharton estates, but to half his father\'s money.\r\n\r\nSir Alured in his letter expressed a hope that Everett might be\r\ninformed instantly. He would have written himself had he known\r\nEverett\'s address. But he did know that his elder cousin was in town,\r\nand he besought his elder cousin to come at once,--quite at once,--to\r\nWharton. Emily, he said, would of course accompany her father on such\r\nan occasion. Then there were long letters from Mary Wharton, and even\r\nfrom Lady Wharton, to Emily. The Whartons must have been very much\r\nmoved when Lady Wharton could be induced to write a long letter. The\r\nWhartons were very much moved. They were in a state of enthusiasm\r\nat these news, amounting almost to fury. It seemed as though they\r\nthought that every tenant and labourer on the estate, and every\r\ntenant and labourer\'s wife, would be in an abnormal condition and\r\nunfit for the duties of life, till they should have seen Everett as\r\nheir of the property. Lady Wharton went so far as to tell Emily which\r\nbedroom was being prepared for Everett,--a bedroom very different in\r\nhonour from any by the occupation of which he had as yet been graced.\r\nAnd there were twenty points as to new wills and new deeds as to\r\nwhich the present baronet wanted the immediate advice of his cousin.\r\nThere were a score of things which could now be done which were\r\nbefore impossible. Trees could be cut down, and buildings put up;\r\nand a little bit of land sold, and a little bit of land bought;--the\r\ndoing of all which would give new life to Sir Alured. A life interest\r\nin an estate is a much pleasanter thing when the heir is a friend\r\nwho can be walked about the property, than when he is an enemy who\r\nmust be kept at arm\'s length. All these delights could now be Sir\r\nAlured\'s,--if the old heir would give him his counsel and the young\r\none his assistance.\r\n\r\nThis change in affairs occasioned some flutter also in Manchester\r\nSquare. It could not make much difference personally to old Mr.\r\nWharton. He was, in fact, as old as the baronet, and did not pay much\r\nregard to his own chance of succession. But the position was one\r\nwhich would suit his son admirably, and he was now on good terms with\r\nhis son. He had convinced himself that Lopez had done all that he\r\ncould to separate them, and therefore found himself to be more bound\r\nto his son than ever. "We must go at once," he said to his daughter,\r\nspeaking almost as though he had forgotten her misery for the moment.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you and Everett ought to be there."\r\n\r\n"Heaven knows where Everett is. I ought to be there, and I suppose\r\nthat on such an occasion as this you will condescend to go with me."\r\n\r\n"Condescend, papa;--what does that mean?"\r\n\r\n"You know I cannot go alone. It is out of the question that I should\r\nleave you here."\r\n\r\n"Why, papa?"\r\n\r\n"And at such a time the family ought to come together. Of course they\r\nwill take it very much amiss if you refuse. What will Lady Wharton\r\nthink if you refuse after her writing such a letter as that? It is my\r\nduty to tell you that you ought to go. You cannot think that it is\r\nright to throw over every friend that you have in the world."\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal more said in which it almost seemed that the\r\nfather\'s tenderness had been worn out. His words were much rougher\r\nand more imperious than any that he had yet spoken since his daughter\r\nhad become a widow, but they were also more efficacious, and\r\ntherefore probably more salutary. After twenty-four hours of this\r\nshe found that she was obliged to yield, and a telegram was sent to\r\nWharton,--by no means the first telegram that had been sent since the\r\nnews had arrived,--saying that Emily would accompany her father. They\r\nwere to occupy themselves for two days further in preparations for\r\ntheir journey.\r\n\r\nThese preparations to Emily were so sad as almost to break her heart.\r\nShe had never as yet packed up her widow\'s weeds. She had never as\r\nyet even contemplated the necessity of coming down to dinner in them\r\nbefore other eyes than those of her father and brother. She had as\r\nyet made none of those struggles with which widows seek to lessen\r\nthe deformity of their costume. It was incumbent on her now to get a\r\nribbon or two less ghastly than those weepers which had, for the last\r\nfive months, hung about her face and shoulders. And then how should\r\nshe look if he were to be there? It was not to be expected that the\r\nWhartons should seclude themselves because of her grief. This very\r\nchange in the circumstances of the property would be sure, of itself,\r\nto bring the Fletchers to Wharton,--and then how should she look at\r\nhim, how answer him, if he spoke to her tenderly? It is very hard for\r\na woman to tell a lie to a man when she loves him. She may speak the\r\nwords. She may be able to assure him that he is indifferent to her.\r\nBut when a woman really loves a man, as she loved this man, there is\r\na desire to touch him which quivers at her fingers\' ends, a longing\r\nto look at him which she cannot keep out of her eyes, an inclination\r\nto be near him which affects every motion of her body. She cannot\r\nrefrain herself from excessive attention to his words. She has a god\r\nto worship, and she cannot control her admiration. Of all this Emily\r\nherself felt much,--but felt at the same time that she would never\r\npardon herself if she betrayed her love by a gleam of her eye, by\r\nthe tone of a word, or the movement of a finger. What,--should she\r\nbe known to love again after such a mistake as hers, after such a\r\ncatastrophe?\r\n\r\nThe evening before they started who should bustle into the house but\r\nEverett himself. It was then about six o\'clock, and he was going to\r\nleave London by the night mail. That he should be a little given\r\nto bustle on such an occasion may perhaps be forgiven him. He\r\nhad heard the news down on the Scotch coast, and had flown up to\r\nLondon, telegraphing as he did so backwards and forwards to Wharton.\r\nOf course he felt that the destruction of his cousin among the\r\nglaciers,--whether by brandy or ice he did not much care,--had made\r\nhim for the nonce one of the important people of the world. The young\r\nman who would not so feel might be the better philosopher, but one\r\nmight doubt whether he would be the better young man. He quite agreed\r\nwith his father that it was his sister\'s duty to go to Wharton, and\r\nhe was now in a position to speak with authority as to the duties of\r\nmembers of his family. He could not wait, even for one night, in\r\norder that he might travel with them. Sir Alured was impatient. Sir\r\nAlured wanted him in Herefordshire. Sir Alured had said that on\r\nsuch an occasion he, the heir, ought to be on the property with the\r\nshortest possible delay. His father smiled;--but with an approving\r\nsmile. Everett therefore started by the night mail, leaving his\r\nfather and sister to follow him on the morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister\'s Political Creed\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke, before he went to Matching, twice reminded Phineas Finn\r\nthat he was expected there in a day or two. "The Duchess says that\r\nyour wife is coming to-morrow," the Duke said on the day of his\r\ndeparture. But Phineas could not go then. His services to his country\r\nwere required among the dockyards and ships, and he postponed his\r\nvisit till the end of September. Then he started for Matching, having\r\nthe double pleasure before him of meeting his wife and his noble host\r\nand hostess. He found a small party there, but not so small as the\r\nDuchess had once suggested to him. "Your wife will be there, of\r\ncourse, Mr. Finn. She is too good to desert me in my troubles. And\r\nthere will probably be Lady Rosina De Courcy. Lady Rosina is to the\r\nDuke what your wife is to me. I don\'t suppose there will be anybody\r\nelse,--except, perhaps, Mr. Warburton." But Lady Rosina was not\r\nthere. In place of Lady Rosina there were the Duke and Duchess of St.\r\nBungay, with their daughters, two or three Palliser offshoots, with\r\ntheir wives, and Barrington Erle. There were, too, the Bishop of the\r\ndiocese with his wife, and three or four others, coming and going, so\r\nthat the party never seemed to be too small. "We asked Mr. Rattler,"\r\nsaid the Duchess in a whisper to Phineas, "but he declined, with a\r\nstring of florid compliments. When Mr. Rattler won\'t come to the\r\nPrime Minister\'s house, you may depend that something is going to\r\nhappen. It is like pigs carrying straws in their mouths. Mr. Rattler\r\nis my pig." Phineas only laughed and said that he did not believe\r\nRattler to be a better pig than any one else.\r\n\r\nIt was soon apparent to Phineas that the Duke\'s manner to him was\r\nentirely altered, so much so that he was compelled to acknowledge to\r\nhimself that he had not hitherto read the Duke\'s character aright.\r\nHitherto he had never found the Duke pleasant in conversation.\r\nLooking back he could hardly remember that he had in truth ever\r\nconversed with the Duke. The man had seemed to shut himself up as\r\nsoon as he had uttered certain words which the circumstances of the\r\nmoment had demanded. Whether it was arrogance or shyness Phineas\r\nhad not known. His wife had said that the Duke was shy. Had he been\r\narrogant the effect would have been the same. He was unbending, hard,\r\nand lucid only when he spoke on some detail of business, or on some\r\npoint of policy. But now he smiled, and though hesitating a little at\r\nfirst, very soon fell into the ways of a pleasant country host. "You\r\nshoot," said the Duke. Phineas did shoot but cared very little about\r\nit. "But you hunt." Phineas was very fond of riding to hounds. "I am\r\nbeginning to think," said the Duke, "that I have made a mistake in\r\nnot caring for such things. When I was very young I gave them up,\r\nbecause it appeared that other men devoted too much time to them. One\r\nmight as well not eat because some men are gluttons."\r\n\r\n"Only that you would die if you did not eat."\r\n\r\n"Bread, I suppose, would keep me alive, but still one eats meat\r\nwithout being a glutton. I very often regret the want of amusements,\r\nand particularly of those which would throw me more among my\r\nfellow-creatures. A man is alone when reading, alone when writing,\r\nalone when thinking. Even sitting in Parliament he is very much\r\nalone, though there be a crowd around him. Now a man can hardly be\r\nthoroughly useful unless he knows his fellow-men, and how is he to\r\nknow them if he shuts himself up? If I had to begin again I think I\r\nwould cultivate the amusements of the time."\r\n\r\nNot long after this the Duke asked him whether he was going to join\r\nthe shooting men on that morning. Phineas declared that his hands\r\nwere too full of business for any amusement before lunch. "Then,"\r\nsaid the Duke, "will you walk with me in the afternoon? There is\r\nnothing I really like so much as a walk. There are some very pretty\r\npoints where the river skirts the park. And I will show you the spot\r\non which Sir Guy de Palliser performed the feat for which the king\r\ngave him this property. It was a grand time when a man could get\r\nhalf-a-dozen parishes because he tickled the king\'s fancy."\r\n\r\n"But suppose he didn\'t tickle the king\'s fancy?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, then indeed, it might go otherwise with him. But I am glad to\r\nsay that Sir Guy was an accomplished courtier."\r\n\r\nThe walk was taken, and the pretty bends of the river were seen; but\r\nthey were looked at without much earnestness, and Sir Guy\'s great\r\ndeed was not again mentioned. The conversation went away to other\r\nmatters. Of course it was not long before the Prime Minister was\r\ndeep in discussing the probabilities of the next Session. It was\r\nsoon apparent to Phineas that the Duke was no longer desirous of\r\nresigning, though he spoke very freely of the probable necessity\r\nthere might be for him to do so. At the present moment he was in his\r\nbest humour. His feet were on his own property. He could see the\r\nprosperity around him. The spot was the one which he loved best in\r\nall the world. He liked his present companion, who was one to whom he\r\nwas entitled to speak with freedom. But there was still present to\r\nhim the sense of some injury from which he could not free himself. Of\r\ncourse he did not know that he had been haughty to Sir Orlando, to\r\nSir Timothy, and others. But he did know that he had intended to be\r\ntrue, and he thought that they had been treacherous. Twelve months\r\nago there had been a goal before him which he might attain, a\r\nwinning-post which was still within his reach. There was in store for\r\nhim the tranquillity of retirement which he would enjoy as soon as a\r\nsense of duty would permit him to seize it. But now the prospect of\r\nthat happiness had gradually vanished from him. That retirement was\r\nno longer a winning-post for him. The poison of place and power and\r\ndignity had got into his blood. As he looked forward he feared rather\r\nthan sighed for retirement. "You think it will go against us," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nPhineas did think so. There was hardly a man high up in the party\r\nwho did not think so. When one branch of a Coalition has gradually\r\ndropped off, the other branch will hardly flourish long. And then the\r\ntints of a political Coalition are so neutral and unalluring that men\r\nwill only endure them when they feel that no more pronounced colours\r\nare within their reach. "After all," said Phineas, "the innings has\r\nnot been a bad one. It has been of service to the country, and has\r\nlasted longer than most men expected."\r\n\r\n"If it has been of service to the country, that is everything. It\r\nshould at least be everything. With the statesman to whom it is not\r\neverything there must be something wrong." The Duke, as he said this,\r\nwas preaching to himself. He was telling himself that, though he saw\r\nthe better way, he was allowing himself to walk on in that which was\r\nworse. For it was not only Phineas who could see the change,--or the\r\nold Duke, or the Duchess. It was apparent to the man himself, though\r\nhe could not prevent it. "I sometimes think," he said, "that we whom\r\nchance has led to be meddlers in the game of politics sometimes give\r\nourselves hardly time enough to think what we are about."\r\n\r\n"A man may have to work so hard," said Phineas, "that he has no time\r\nfor thinking."\r\n\r\n"Or more probably, may be so eager in party conflict that he will\r\nhardly keep his mind cool enough for thought. It seems to me that\r\nmany men,--men whom you and I know,--embrace the profession of\r\npolitics not only without political convictions, but without seeing\r\nthat it is proper that they should entertain them. Chance brings a\r\nyoung man under the guidance of this or that elder man. He has come\r\nof a Whig family, as was my case,--or from some old Tory stock; and\r\nloyalty keeps him true to the interests which have first pushed him\r\nforward into the world. There is no conviction there."\r\n\r\n"Convictions grow."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--the conviction that it is the man\'s duty to be a staunch\r\nLiberal, but not the reason why. Or a man sees his opening on this\r\nside or on that,--as is the case with the lawyers. Or he has a body\r\nof men at his back ready to support him on this side or on that, as\r\nwe see with commercial men. Or perhaps he has some vague idea that\r\naristocracy is pleasant, and he becomes a Conservative,--or that\r\ndemocracy is prospering, and he becomes a Liberal. You are a Liberal,\r\nMr. Finn."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Duke."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Well;--after what you have said I will not boast of myself.\r\nExperience, however, seems to show me that Liberalism is demanded by\r\nthe country."\r\n\r\n"So, perhaps, at certain epochs, may the Devil and all his works; but\r\nyou will hardly say that you will carry the Devil\'s colours because\r\nthe country may like the Devil. It is not sufficient, I think, to say\r\nthat Liberalism is demanded. You should first know what Liberalism\r\nmeans, and then assure yourself that the thing itself is good. I dare\r\nsay you have done so; but I see some who never make the inquiry."\r\n\r\n"I will not claim to be better than my neighbours,--I mean my real\r\nneighbours."\r\n\r\n"I understand; I understand," said the Duke laughing. "You prefer\r\nsome good Samaritan on the opposition benches to Sir Timothy and the\r\nPharisees. It is hard to come wounded out of the fight, and then to\r\nsee him who should be your friend not only walking by on the other\r\nside, but flinging a stone at you as he goes. But I did not mean just\r\nnow to allude to the details of recent misfortunes, though there is\r\nno one to whom I could do so more openly than to you. I was trying\r\nyesterday to explain to myself why I have, all my life, sat on what\r\nis called the Liberal side of the House to which I have belonged."\r\n\r\n"Did you succeed?"\r\n\r\n"I began life with the misfortune of a ready-made political creed.\r\nThere was a seat in the House for me when I was twenty-one. Nobody\r\ntook the trouble to ask me my opinions. It was a matter of course\r\nthat I should be a Liberal. My uncle, whom nothing could ever induce\r\nto move in politics himself, took it for granted that I should run\r\nstraight,--as he would have said. It was a tradition of the family,\r\nand was as inseparable from it as any of the titles which he had\r\ninherited. The property might be sold or squandered,--but the\r\npolitical creed was fixed as adamant. I don\'t know that I ever had\r\na wish to rebel, but I think that I took it at first very much as a\r\nmatter of course."\r\n\r\n"A man seldom inquires very deeply at twenty-one."\r\n\r\n"And if he does it is ten to one but he comes to a wrong conclusion.\r\nBut since then I have satisfied myself that chance put me into the\r\nright course. It has been, I dare say, the same with you as with me.\r\nWe both went into office early, and the anxiety to do special duties\r\nwell probably deterred us both from thinking much of the great\r\nquestion. When a man has to be on the alert to keep Ireland quiet, or\r\nto prevent peculation in the dockyards, or to raise the revenue while\r\nhe lowers the taxes, he feels himself to be saved from the necessity\r\nof investigating principles. In this way I sometimes think that\r\nministers, or they who have been ministers and who have to watch\r\nministers from the opposition benches, have less opportunity of\r\nbecoming real politicians than the men who sit in Parliament with\r\nempty hands and with time at their own disposal. But when a man has\r\nbeen placed by circumstances as I am now, he does begin to think."\r\n\r\n"And yet you have not empty hands."\r\n\r\n"They are not so full, perhaps, as you think. At any rate I cannot\r\ncontent myself with a single branch of the public service as I used\r\nto do in old days. Do not suppose that I claim to have made any grand\r\npolitical invention, but I think that I have at least labelled my own\r\nthoughts. I suppose what we all desire is to improve the condition of\r\nthe people by whom we are employed, and to advance our country, or at\r\nany rate to save it from retrogression."\r\n\r\n"That of course."\r\n\r\n"So much is of course. I give credit to my opponents in Parliament\r\nfor that desire quite as readily as I do to my colleagues or to\r\nmyself. The idea that political virtue is all on one side is both\r\nmischievous and absurd. We allow ourselves to talk in that way\r\nbecause indignation, scorn, and sometimes, I fear, vituperation, are\r\nthe fuel with which the necessary heat of debate is maintained."\r\n\r\n"There are some men who are very fond of poking the fire," said\r\nPhineas.\r\n\r\n"Well; I won\'t name any one at present," said the Duke, "but I have\r\nseen gentlemen of your country very handy with the pokers." Phineas\r\nlaughed, knowing that he had been considered by some to have been\r\na little violent when defending the Duke. "But we put all that\r\naside when we really think, and can give the Conservative credit\r\nfor philanthropy and patriotism as readily as the Liberal. The\r\nConservative who has had any idea of the meaning of the name which\r\nhe carries, wishes, I suppose, to maintain the differences and the\r\ndistances which separate the highly placed from their lower brethren.\r\nHe thinks that God has divided the world as he finds it divided, and\r\nthat he may best do his duty by making the inferior man happy and\r\ncontented in his position, teaching him that the place which he holds\r\nis his by God\'s ordinance."\r\n\r\n"And it is so."\r\n\r\n"Hardly in the sense that I mean. But that is the great Conservative\r\nlesson. That lesson seems to me to be hardly compatible with\r\ncontinual improvement in the condition of the lower man. But with\r\nthe Conservative all such improvement is to be based on the idea of\r\nthe maintenance of those distances. I as a Duke am to be kept as far\r\napart from the man who drives my horses as was my ancestor from the\r\nman who drove his, or who rode after him to the wars,--and that is to\r\ngo on for ever. There is much to be said for such a scheme. Let the\r\nlords be, all of them, men with loving hearts, and clear intellect,\r\nand noble instincts, and it is possible that they should use their\r\npowers so beneficently as to spread happiness over the earth. It is\r\none of the millenniums which the mind of man can conceive, and seems\r\nto be that which the Conservative mind does conceive."\r\n\r\n"But the other men who are not lords don\'t want that kind of\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\n"If such happiness were attainable it might be well to constrain\r\nmen to accept it. But the lords of this world are fallible men; and\r\nthough as units they ought to be and perhaps are better than those\r\nothers who have fewer advantages, they are much more likely as units\r\nto go astray in opinion than the bodies of men whom they would seek\r\nto govern. We know that power does corrupt, and that we cannot\r\ntrust kings to have loving hearts, and clear intellects, and noble\r\ninstincts. Men as they come to think about it and to look forward,\r\nand to look back, will not believe in such a millennium as that."\r\n\r\n"Do they believe in any millennium?"\r\n\r\n"I think they do after a fashion, and I think that I do myself. That\r\nis my idea of Conservatism. The doctrine of Liberalism is, of course,\r\nthe reverse. The Liberal, if he have any fixed idea at all, must, I\r\nthink, have conceived the idea of lessening distances,--of bringing\r\nthe coachman and the duke nearer together,--nearer and nearer, till a\r\nmillennium shall be reached by--"\r\n\r\n"By equality?" asked Phineas, eagerly interrupting the Prime\r\nMinister, and showing his dissent by the tone of his voice.\r\n\r\n"I did not use the word, which is open to many objections. In the\r\nfirst place the millennium, which I have perhaps rashly named, is\r\nso distant that we need not even think of it as possible. Men\'s\r\nintellects are at present so various that we cannot even realise the\r\nidea of equality, and here in England we have been taught to hate the\r\nword by the evil effects of those absurd attempts which have been\r\nmade elsewhere to proclaim it as a fact accomplished by the scratch\r\nof a pen or by a chisel on a stone. We have been injured in that,\r\nbecause a good word signifying a grand idea has been driven out of\r\nthe vocabulary of good men. Equality would be a heaven, if we could\r\nattain it. How can we to whom so much has been given dare to think\r\notherwise? How can you look at the bowed back and bent legs and\r\nabject face of that poor ploughman, who winter and summer has to drag\r\nhis rheumatic limbs to his work, while you go a-hunting or sit in\r\npride of place among the foremost few of your country, and say that\r\nit all is as it ought to be? You are a Liberal because you know that\r\nit is not all as it ought to be, and because you would still march on\r\nto some nearer approach to equality; though the thing itself is so\r\ngreat, so glorious, so godlike,--nay, so absolutely divine,--that you\r\nhave been disgusted by the very promise of it, because its perfection\r\nis unattainable. Men have asserted a mock equality till the very idea\r\nof equality stinks in men\'s nostrils."\r\n\r\nThe Duke in his enthusiasm had thrown off his hat, and was sitting\r\non a wooden seat which they had reached, looking up among the clouds.\r\nHis left hand was clenched, and from time to time with his right\r\nhe rubbed the thin hairs on his brow. He had begun in a low voice,\r\nwith a somewhat slipshod enunciation of his words, but had gradually\r\nbecome clear, resonant, and even eloquent. Phineas knew that there\r\nwere stories told of certain bursts of words which had come from\r\nhim in former days in the House of Commons. These had occasionally\r\nsurprised men and induced them to declare that Planty Pall,--as he\r\nwas then often called,--was a dark horse. But they had been few and\r\nfar between, and Phineas had never heard them. Now he gazed at his\r\ncompanion in silence, wondering whether the speaker would go on with\r\nhis speech. But the face changed on a sudden, and the Duke with an\r\nawkward motion snatched up his hat. "I hope you ain\'t cold," he said.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said Phineas.\r\n\r\n"I came here because of that bend of the river. I am always very\r\nfond of that bend. We don\'t go over the river. That is Mr. Upjohn\'s\r\nproperty."\r\n\r\n"The member for the county?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and a very good member he is too, though he doesn\'t support\r\nus;--an old-school Tory, but a great friend of my uncle, who after\r\nall had a good deal of the Tory about him. I wonder whether he is at\r\nhome. I must remind the Duchess to ask him to dinner. You know him,\r\nof course."\r\n\r\n"Only by just seeing him in the House."\r\n\r\n"You\'d like him very much. When in the country he always wears\r\nknee-breeches and gaiters, which I think a very comfortable dress."\r\n\r\n"Troublesome, Duke; isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I never tried it, and I shouldn\'t dare now. Goodness, me; it\'s past\r\nfive o\'clock, and we\'ve got two miles to get home. I haven\'t looked\r\nat a letter, and Warburton will think that I\'ve thrown myself into\r\nthe river because of Sir Timothy Beeswax." Then they started to go\r\nhome at a fast pace.\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t forget, Duke," said Phineas, "your definition of\r\nConservatives and Liberals."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I ventured on a definition;--only a few loose ideas\r\nwhich had been troubling me lately. I say, Finn!"\r\n\r\n"Your Grace?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you go and tell Ramsden and Drummond that I have been\r\npreaching equality, or we shall have a pretty mess. I don\'t know that\r\nit would serve me with my dear friend, the Duke."\r\n\r\n"I will be discretion itself."\r\n\r\n"Equality is a dream. But sometimes one likes to dream,--especially\r\nas there is no danger that Matching will fly from me in a dream. I\r\ndoubt whether I could bear the test that has been attempted in other\r\ncountries."\r\n\r\n"That poor ploughman would hardly get his share, Duke."\r\n\r\n"No;--that\'s where it is. We can only do a little and a little to\r\nbring it nearer to us;--so little that it won\'t touch Matching in our\r\nday. Here is her ladyship and the ponies. I don\'t think her ladyship\r\nwould like to lose her ponies by my doctrine."\r\n\r\nThe two wives of the two men were in the pony carriage, and the\r\nlittle Lady Glencora, the Duchess\'s eldest daughter, was sitting\r\nbetween them. "Mr. Warburton has sent three messengers to demand your\r\npresence," said the Duchess, "and, as I live by bread, I believe that\r\nyou and Mr. Finn have been amusing yourselves!"\r\n\r\n"We have been talking politics," said the Duke.\r\n\r\n"Of course. What other amusement was possible? But what business\r\nhave you to indulge in idle talk when Mr. Warburton wants you in the\r\nlibrary? There has come a box," she said, "big enough to contain\r\nthe resignations of all the traitors of the party." This was strong\r\nlanguage, and the Duke frowned;--but there was no one there to\r\nhear it but Phineas Finn and his wife, and they, at least, were\r\ntrustworthy. The Duke suggested that he had better get back to the\r\nhouse as soon as possible. There might be something to be done\r\nrequiring time before dinner. Mr. Warburton might, at any rate, want\r\nto smoke a tranquil cigar after his day\'s work. The Duchess therefore\r\nleft the carriage, as did Mrs. Finn, and the Duke undertook to drive\r\nthe little girl back to the house. "He\'ll surely go against a tree,"\r\nsaid the Duchess. But,--as a fact,--the Duke did take himself and the\r\nchild home in safety.\r\n\r\n"And what do you think about it, Mr. Finn?" said her Grace. "I\r\nsuppose you and the Duke have been settling what is to be done."\r\n\r\n"We have certainly settled nothing."\r\n\r\n"Then you must have disagreed."\r\n\r\n"That we as certainly have not done. We have in truth not once been\r\nout of cloud-land."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--then there is no hope. When once grown-up politicians get into\r\ncloud-land it is because the realities of the world have no longer\r\nany charm for them."\r\n\r\nThe big box did not contain the resignations of any of the\r\nobjectionable members of the Coalition. Ministers do not often resign\r\nin September,--nor would it be expedient that they should do so. Lord\r\nDrummond and Sir Timothy were safe, at any rate, till next February,\r\nand might live without any show either of obedience or mutiny.\r\nThe Duke remained in comparative quiet at Matching. There was not\r\nvery much to do, except to prepare the work for the next Session.\r\nThe great work of the coming year was to be the assimilation, or\r\nsomething very near to the assimilation, of the county suffrages\r\nwith those of the boroughs. The measure was one which had now been\r\npromised by statesmen for the last two years,--promised at first with\r\nthat half promise which would mean nothing, were it not that such\r\npromises always lead to more defined assurances. The Duke of St.\r\nBungay, Lord Drummond, and other Ministers had wished to stave it\r\noff. Mr. Monk was eager for its adoption, and was of course supported\r\nby Phineas Finn. The Prime Minister had at first been inclined to be\r\nled by the old Duke. There was no doubt to him but that the measure\r\nwas desirable and would come, but there might well be a question\r\nas to the time at which it should be made to come. The old Duke\r\nknew that the measure would come,--but believing it to be wholly\r\nundesirable, thought that he was doing good work in postponing it\r\nfrom year to year. But Mr. Monk had become urgent, and the old Duke\r\nhad admitted the necessity. There must surely have been a shade of\r\nmelancholy on that old man\'s mind as, year after year, he assisted\r\nin pulling down institutions which he in truth regarded as the\r\nsafeguards of the nation;--but which he knew that, as a Liberal, he\r\nwas bound to assist in destroying! It must have occurred to him, from\r\ntime to time, that it would be well for him to depart and be at peace\r\nbefore everything was gone.\r\n\r\nWhen he went from Matching Mr. Monk took his place, and Phineas Finn,\r\nwho had gone up to London for a while, returned; and then the three\r\nbetween them, with assistance from Mr. Warburton and others, worked\r\nout the proposed scheme of the new county franchise, with the new\r\ndivisions and the new constituencies. But it could hardly have been\r\nhearty work, as they all of them felt that whatever might be their\r\nfirst proposition they would be beat upon it in a House of Commons\r\nwhich thought that this Aristides had been long enough at the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX\r\n\r\nMrs. Parker\'s Fate\r\n\r\n\r\nLopez had now been dead more than five months, and not a word had\r\nbeen heard by his widow of Mrs. Parker and her children. Her own\r\nsorrows had been so great that she had hardly thought of those of the\r\npoor woman who had come to her but a few days before her husband\'s\r\ndeath, telling her of ruin caused by her husband\'s treachery. But\r\nlate on the evening before her departure for Herefordshire,--very\r\nshortly after Everett had left the house,--there was a ring at\r\nthe door, and a poorly-clad female asked to see Mrs. Lopez. The\r\npoorly-clad female was Sexty Parker\'s wife. The servant, who did not\r\nremember her, would not leave her alone in the hall, having an eye to\r\nthe coats and umbrellas, but called up one of the maids to carry the\r\nmessage. The poor woman understood the insult and resented it in her\r\nheart. But Mrs. Lopez recognised the name in a moment, and went down\r\nto her in the parlour, leaving Mr. Wharton upstairs. Mrs. Parker,\r\nsmarting from her present grievance, had bent her mind on complaining\r\nat once of the treatment she had received from the servant, but the\r\nsight of the widow\'s weeds quelled her. Emily had never been much\r\ngiven to fine clothes, either as a girl or as a married woman; but\r\nit had always been her husband\'s pleasure that she should be well\r\ndressed,--though he had never carried his trouble so far as to pay\r\nthe bills; and Mrs. Parker\'s remembrance of her friend at Dovercourt\r\nhad been that of a fine lady in bright apparel. Now a black\r\nshade,--something almost like a dark ghost,--glided into the room,\r\nand Mrs. Parker forgot her recent injury. Emily came forward and\r\noffered her hand, and was the first to speak. "I have had a great\r\nsorrow since we met," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, Mrs. Lopez. I don\'t think there is anything left in the\r\nworld now except sorrow."\r\n\r\n"I hope Mr. Parker is well. Will you not sit down, Mrs. Parker?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am. Indeed, then, he is not well at all. How should he\r\nbe well? Everything,--everything has been taken away from him." Poor\r\nEmily groaned as she heard this. "I wouldn\'t say a word against them\r\nas is gone, Mrs. Lopez, if I could help it. I know it is bad to bear\r\nwhen him who once loved you isn\'t no more. And perhaps it is all the\r\nworse when things didn\'t go well with him, and it was, maybe, his own\r\nfault. I wouldn\'t do it, Mrs. Lopez, if I could help it."\r\n\r\n"Let me hear what you have to say," said Emily, determined to suffer\r\neverything patiently.\r\n\r\n"Well;--it is just this. He has left us that bare that there is\r\nnothing left. And that, they say, isn\'t the worst of all,--though\r\nwhat can be worse than doing that, how is a woman to think? Parker\r\nwas that soft, and he had that way with him of talking, that he has\r\ntalked me and mine out of the very linen on our backs."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by saying that that is not the worst?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve come upon Sexty for a bill for four hundred and\r\nfifty,--something to do with that stuff they call Bios,--and Sexty\r\nsays it isn\'t his name at all. But he\'s been in that state he don\'t\r\nhardly know how to swear to anything. But he\'s sure he didn\'t sign\r\nit. The bill was brought to him by Lopez, and there was words between\r\nthem, and he wouldn\'t have nothing to do with it. How is he to go to\r\nlaw? And it don\'t make much difference neither, for they can\'t take\r\nmuch more from him than they have taken." Emily as she heard all\r\nthis sat shivering, trying to repress her groans. "Only," continued\r\nMrs. Parker, "they hadn\'t sold the furniture, and I was thinking\r\nthey might let me stay in the house, and try to do with letting\r\nlodgings,--and now they\'re seizing everything along of this bill.\r\nSexty is like a madman, swearing this and swearing that;--but what\r\ncan he do, Mrs. Lopez? It\'s as like his hand as two peas; but he was\r\nclever at everything was--was--you know who I mean, ma\'am." Then\r\nEmily covered her face with her hands and burst into violent tears.\r\nShe had not determined whether she did or did not believe this\r\nlast accusation made against her husband. She had had hardly time\r\nto realise the criminality of the offence imputed. But she did\r\nbelieve that the woman before her had been ruined by her husband\'s\r\nspeculations. "It\'s very bad, ma\'am; isn\'t it?" said Mrs. Parker,\r\ncrying for company. "It\'s bad all round. If you had five children as\r\nhadn\'t bread you\'d know how it is that I feel. I\'ve got to go back\r\nby the 10.15 to-night, and when I\'ve paid for a third-class ticket I\r\nshan\'t have but twopence left in the world."\r\n\r\nThis utter depth of immediate poverty, this want of bread for the\r\nmorrow and the next day, Emily could relieve out of her own pocket.\r\nAnd, thinking of this and remembering that her purse was not with her\r\nat the moment, she started up with the idea of getting it. But it\r\noccurred to her that that would not suffice; that her duty required\r\nmore of her than that. And yet, by her own power, she could do no\r\nmore. From month to month, almost from week to week, since her\r\nhusband\'s death, her father had been called upon to satisfy claims\r\nfor money which he would not resist, lest by doing so he should add\r\nto her misery. She had felt that she ought to bind herself to the\r\nstrictest personal economy because of the miserable losses to which\r\nshe had subjected him by her ill-starred marriage. "What would you\r\nwish me to do?" she said, resuming her seat.\r\n\r\n"You are rich," said Mrs. Parker. Emily shook her head. "They say\r\nyour papa is rich. I thought you would not like to see me in want\r\nlike this."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, indeed, it makes me very unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t your papa do something? It wasn\'t Sexty\'s fault nigh\r\nso much as it was his. I wouldn\'t say it to you if it wasn\'t for\r\nstarving. I wouldn\'t say it to you if it wasn\'t for the children.\r\nI\'d lie in the ditch and die if it was only myself, because--because\r\nI know what your feelings is. But what wouldn\'t you do, and what\r\nwouldn\'t you say, if you had five children at home as hadn\'t a loaf\r\nof bread among \'em?" Hereupon Emily got up and left the room, bidding\r\nher visitor wait for a few minutes. Presently the offensive butler\r\ncame in, who had wronged Mrs. Parker by watching his master\'s coats,\r\nand brought a tray with meat and wine. Mr. Wharton, said the altered\r\nman, hoped that Mrs. Parker would take a little refreshment, and he\r\nwould be down himself very soon. Mrs. Parker, knowing that strength\r\nfor her journey home would be necessary to her, remembering that she\r\nwould have to walk all through the city to the Bishopsgate Street\r\nstation, did take some refreshment, and permitted herself to drink\r\nthe glass of sherry that her late enemy had benignantly poured out\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nEmily had been nearly half-an-hour with her father before Mr.\r\nWharton\'s heavy step was heard upon the stairs. And when he reached\r\nthe dining-room door he paused a moment before he ventured to turn\r\nthe lock. He had not told Emily what he would do, and had hardly as\r\nyet made up his own mind. As every fresh call was made upon him, his\r\nhatred for the memory of the man who had stepped in and disturbed his\r\nwhole life, and turned all the mellow satisfaction of his evening\r\ninto storm and gloom, was of course increased. The scoundrel\'s\r\nname was so odious to him that he could hardly keep himself from\r\nshuddering visibly before his daughter even when the servants called\r\nher by it. But yet he had determined that he would devote himself to\r\nsave her from further suffering. It had been her fault, no doubt. But\r\nshe was expiating it in very sackcloth and ashes, and he would add\r\nnothing to the burden on her back. He would pay, and pay, and pay,\r\nmerely remembering that what he paid must be deducted from her share\r\nof his property. He had never intended to make what is called an\r\nelder son of Everett, and now there was less necessity than ever\r\nthat he should do so, as Everett had become an elder son in another\r\ndirection. He could satisfy almost any demand that might be made\r\nwithout material injury to himself. But these demands, one after\r\nanother, scalded him by their frequency, and by the baseness of the\r\nman who had occasioned them. His daughter had now repeated to him\r\nwith sobbings and wailings the whole story as it had been told to her\r\nby the woman downstairs. "Papa," she had said, "I don\'t know how to\r\ntell you or how not." Then he had encouraged her, and had listened\r\nwithout saying a word. He had endeavoured not even to shrink as the\r\ncharge of forgery was repeated to him by his own child,--the widow\r\nof the guilty man. He endeavoured not to remember at the moment that\r\nshe had claimed this wretch as the chosen one of her maiden heart, in\r\nopposition to all his wishes. It hardly occurred to him to disbelieve\r\nthe accusation. It was so probable! What was there to hinder the\r\nman from forgery, if he could only make it believed that his victim\r\nhad signed the bill when intoxicated? He heard it all;--kissed his\r\ndaughter, and then went down to the dining-room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Parker, when she saw him, got up, and curtsied low, and then sat\r\ndown again. Old Wharton looked at her from under his bushy eyebrows\r\nbefore he spoke, and then sat opposite to her. "Madam," he said,\r\n"this is a very sad story that I have heard." Mrs. Parker again rose,\r\nagain curtsied, and put her handkerchief to her face. "It is of no\r\nuse talking any more about it here."\r\n\r\n"No, sir," said Mrs. Parker.\r\n\r\n"I and my daughter leave town early to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir. Mrs. Lopez didn\'t tell me."\r\n\r\n"My clerk will be in London, at No. 12, Stone Buildings, Lincoln\'s\r\nInn, till I come back. Do you think you can find the place? I have\r\nwritten it there."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I can find it," said Mrs. Parker, just raising herself\r\nfrom her chair at every word she spoke.\r\n\r\n"I have written his name, you see. Mr. Crumpy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"If you will permit me, I will give you two sovereigns now."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir."\r\n\r\n"And if you can make it convenient to call on Mr. Crumpy every\r\nThursday morning about twelve, he will pay you two sovereigns a week\r\ntill I come back to town. Then I will see about it."\r\n\r\n"God Almighty bless you, sir!"\r\n\r\n"And as to the furniture, I will write to my attorney, Mr. Walker.\r\nYou need not trouble yourself by going to him."\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"If necessary, he will send to you, and he will see what can be done.\r\nGood night, Mrs. Parker." Then he walked across the room with two\r\nsovereigns which he dropped in her hand. Mrs. Parker, with many sobs,\r\nbade him farewell, and Mr. Wharton stood in the hall immovable till\r\nthe front door had been closed behind her. "I have settled it," he\r\nsaid to Emily. "I\'ll tell you to-morrow, or some day. Don\'t worry\r\nyourself now, but go to bed." She looked wistfully,--so sadly, up\r\ninto his face, and then did as he bade her.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Wharton could not go to bed without further trouble. It was\r\nincumbent on him to write full particulars that very night both to\r\nMr. Walker and to Mr. Crumpy. And the odious letters in the writing\r\nbecame very long;--odious because he had to confess in them over and\r\nover again that his daughter, the very apple of his eye, had been the\r\nwife of a scoundrel. To Mr. Walker he had to tell the whole story of\r\nthe alleged forgery, and in doing so could not abstain from the use\r\nof hard words. "I don\'t suppose that it can be proved, but there is\r\nevery reason to believe that it\'s true." And again--"I believe the\r\nman to have been as vile a scoundrel as ever was made by the love\r\nof money." Even to Mr. Crumpy he could not be reticent. "She is an\r\nobject of pity," he said. "Her husband was ruined by the infamous\r\nspeculations of Mr. Lopez." Then he betook himself to bed. Oh, how\r\nhappy would he be to pay the two pounds weekly,--even to add to that\r\nthe amount of the forged bill, if by doing so he might be saved from\r\never again hearing the name of Lopez.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the bill was ultimately lost by the bankers who had\r\nadvanced money on it. As for Mrs. Sexty Parker, from week to week,\r\nand from month to month, and at last from year to year, she and\r\nher children,--and probably her husband also,--were supported by\r\nthe weekly pension of two sovereigns which she always received on\r\nThursday morning from the hands of Mr. Crumpy himself. In a little\r\ntime the one excitement of her life was the weekly journey to Mr.\r\nCrumpy, whom she came to regard as a man appointed by Providence\r\nto supply her with 40s. on Thursday morning. As to poor Sexty\r\nParker,--it is to be feared that he never again became a prosperous\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"You will tell me what you did for that poor woman, papa," said\r\nEmily, leaning over her father in the train.\r\n\r\n"I have settled it, my dear."\r\n\r\n"You said you\'d tell me."\r\n\r\n"Crumpy will pay her two pounds a week till we know more about it."\r\nEmily pressed her father\'s hand and that was an end. No one ever did\r\nknow any more about it, and Crumpy continued to pay the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX\r\n\r\nAt Wharton\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wharton and his daughter reached Wharton Hall there were at\r\nany rate no Fletchers there as yet. Emily, as she was driven from\r\nthe station to the house, had not dared to ask a question or even to\r\nprompt her father to do so. He would probably have told her that on\r\nsuch an occasion there was but little chance that she would find any\r\nvisitors, and none at all that she would find Arthur Fletcher. But\r\nshe was too confused and too ill at ease to think of probabilities,\r\nand to the last was in trepidation, specially lest she should meet\r\nher lover. She found, however, at Wharton Hall none but Whartons,\r\nand she found also to her great relief that this change in the heir\r\nrelieved her of much of the attention which must otherwise have added\r\nto her troubles. At the first glance her dress and demeanour struck\r\nthem so forcibly that they could not avoid showing their feeling. Of\r\ncourse they had expected to see her in black,--had expected to see\r\nher in widow\'s weeds. But, with her, her very face and limbs had so\r\nadapted themselves to her crape, that she looked like a monument of\r\nbereaved woe. Lady Wharton took the mourner up into her own room, and\r\nthere made her a little speech. "We have all wept for you," she said,\r\n"and grieve for you still. But excessive grief is wicked, especially\r\nin the young. We will do our best to make you happy, and hope we\r\nshall succeed. All this about dear Everett ought to be a comfort to\r\nyou." Emily promised that she would do her best, not, however, taking\r\nmuch immediate comfort from the prospects of dear Everett. Lady\r\nWharton certainly had never in her life spoken of dear Everett while\r\nthe wicked cousin was alive. Then Mary Wharton also made her little\r\nspeech. "Dear Emily, I will do all that I can. Pray try to believe in\r\nme." But Everett was so much the hero of the hour, that there was not\r\nmuch room for general attention to any one else.\r\n\r\nThere was very much room for triumph in regard to Everett. It had\r\nalready been ascertained that the Wharton who was now dead had had\r\na child,--but that the child was a daughter. Oh,--what salvation or\r\ndestruction there may be to an English gentleman in the sex of an\r\ninfant! This poor baby was now little better than a beggar brat,\r\nunless the relatives who were utterly disregardful of its fate,\r\nshould choose, in their charity, to make some small allowance for\r\nits maintenance. Had it by chance been a boy, Everett Wharton would\r\nhave been nobody; and the child, rescued from the iniquities of his\r\nparents, would have been nursed in the best bedroom of Wharton Hall,\r\nand cherished with the warmest kisses, and would have been the centre\r\nof all the hopes of all the Whartons. But the Wharton lawyer by use\r\nof reckless telegrams had certified himself that the infant was a\r\ngirl, and Everett was the hero of the day. He found himself to be\r\npossessed of a thousand graces, even in his father\'s eyesight. It\r\nseemed to be taken as a mark of his special good fortune that he had\r\nnot clung to any business. To have been a banker immersed in the\r\nmaking of money, or even a lawyer attached to his circuit and his\r\ncourt, would have lessened his fitness, or at any rate his readiness,\r\nfor the duties which he would have to perform. He would never be a\r\nvery rich man, but he would have a command of ready money, and of\r\ncourse he would go into Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn his new position as,--not quite head of his family, but head\r\nexpectant,--it seemed to him to be his duty to lecture his sister.\r\nIt might be well that some one should lecture her with more severity\r\nthan her father used. Undoubtedly she was succumbing to the\r\nwretchedness of her position in a manner that was repugnant to\r\nhumanity generally. There is no power so useful to man as that\r\ncapacity of recovering himself after a fall, which belongs especially\r\nto those who possess a healthy mind in a healthy body. It is not rare\r\nto see one,--generally a woman,--whom a sorrow gradually kills; and\r\nthere are those among us, who hardly perhaps envy, but certainly\r\nadmire, a spirit so delicate as to be snuffed out by a woe. But it\r\nis the weakness of the heart rather than the strength of the feeling\r\nwhich has in such cases most often produced the destruction. Some\r\nendurance of fibre has been wanting, which power of endurance is a\r\nnoble attribute. Everett Wharton saw something of this, and being,\r\nnow, the heir apparent of the family, took his sister to task.\r\n"Emily," he said, "you make us all unhappy when we look at you."\r\n\r\n"Do I?" she said. "I am sorry for that;--but why should you look at\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Because you are one of us. Of course we cannot shake you\r\noff. We would not if we could. We have all been very unhappy\r\nbecause,--because of what has happened. But don\'t you think you ought\r\nto make some sacrifice to us,--to our father, I mean, and to Sir\r\nAlured and Lady Wharton? When you go on weeping, other people have to\r\nweep too. I have an idea that people ought to be happy if it be only\r\nfor the sake of their neighbours."\r\n\r\n"What am I to do, Everett?"\r\n\r\n"Talk to people a little, and smile sometimes. Move about quicker.\r\nDon\'t look when you come into a room as if you were consecrating it\r\nto tears. And, if I may venture to say so, drop something of the\r\nheaviness of your mourning."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that I am a hypocrite?"\r\n\r\n"No;--I mean nothing of the kind. You know I don\'t. But you may exert\r\nyourself for the benefit of others without being untrue to your own\r\nmemories. I am sure you know what I mean. Make a struggle and see if\r\nyou cannot do something."\r\n\r\nShe did make a struggle, and she did do something. No one, not well\r\nversed in the mysteries of feminine dress, could say very accurately\r\nwhat it was that she had done; but every one felt that something of\r\nthe weight was reduced. At first, as her brother\'s words came upon\r\nher ear, and as she felt the blows which they inflicted on her, she\r\naccused him in her heart of cruelty. They were very hard to bear.\r\nThere was a moment in which she was almost tempted to turn upon him\r\nand tell him that he knew nothing of her sorrows. But she restrained\r\nherself, and when she was alone she acknowledged to herself that he\r\nhad spoken the truth. No one has a right to go about the world as\r\na Niobe, damping all joys with selfish tears. What did she not owe\r\nto her father, who had warned her so often against the evil she had\r\ncontemplated, and had then, from the first moment after the fault was\r\ndone, forgiven her the doing of it? She had at any rate learned from\r\nher misfortunes the infinite tenderness of his heart, which in the\r\ndays of their unalloyed prosperity he had never felt the necessity of\r\nexposing to her. So she struggled and did do something. She pressed\r\nLady Wharton\'s hand, and kissed her cousin Mary, and throwing herself\r\ninto her father\'s arms when they were alone, whispered to him that\r\nshe would try. "What you told me, Everett, was quite right," she said\r\nafterwards to her brother.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to be savage," he answered with a smile.\r\n\r\n"It was quite right, and I have thought of it, and I will do my best.\r\nI will keep it to myself if I can. It is not quite, perhaps, what you\r\nthink it is, but I will keep it to myself." She fancied that they\r\ndid not understand her, and perhaps she was right. It was not only\r\nthat he had died and left her a young widow;--nor even that his end\r\nhad been so harsh a tragedy and so foul a disgrace! It was not only\r\nthat her love had been misbestowed,--not only that she had made so\r\ngrievous an error in the one great act of her life which she had\r\nchosen to perform on her own judgment! Perhaps the most crushing\r\nmemory of all was that which told her that she, who had through all\r\nher youth been regarded as a bright star in the family, had been the\r\none person to bring a reproach upon the name of all these people who\r\nwere so good to her. How shall a person conscious of disgrace, with\r\na mind capable of feeling the crushing weight of personal disgrace,\r\nmove and look and speak as though that disgrace had been washed away?\r\nBut she made the struggle, and did not altogether fail.\r\n\r\nAs regarded Sir Alured, in spite of this poor widow\'s crape, he was\r\nvery happy at this time, and his joy did in some degree communicate\r\nitself to the old barrister. Everett was taken round to every tenant\r\nand introduced as the heir. Mr. Wharton had already declared his\r\npurpose of abdicating any possible possession of the property. Should\r\nhe outlive Sir Alured he must be the baronet; but when that sad event\r\nshould take place, whether Mr. Wharton should then be alive or no,\r\nEverett should at once be the possessor of Wharton Hall. Sir Alured,\r\nunder these circumstances, discussed his own death with extreme\r\nsatisfaction, and insisted on having it discussed by the others.\r\nThat he should have gone and left everything at the mercy of the\r\nspendthrift had been terrible to his old heart;--but now, the man\r\ncoming to the property would have L60,000 with which to support and\r\nfoster Wharton, with which to mend, as it were, the crevices, and\r\nstop up the holes of the estate. He seemed to be almost impatient for\r\nEverett\'s ownership, giving many hints as to what should be done when\r\nhe himself was gone. He must surely have thought that he would return\r\nto Wharton as a spirit, and take a ghostly share in the prosperity of\r\nthe farms. "You will find John Griffith a very good man," said the\r\nbaronet. John Griffith had been a tenant on the estate for the last\r\nhalf-century, and was an older man than his landlord; but the baronet\r\nspoke of all this as though he himself were about to leave Wharton\r\nfor ever in the course of the next week. "John Griffith has been a\r\ngood man, and if not always quite ready with his rent, has never been\r\nmuch behind. You won\'t be hard on John Griffith?"\r\n\r\n"I hope I mayn\'t have the opportunity, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well;--well;--well; that\'s as may be. But I don\'t quite know what\r\nto say about young John. The farm has gone from father to son, and\r\nthere\'s never been a word of a lease."\r\n\r\n"Is there anything wrong about the young man?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a little given to poaching."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always got him off for his father\'s sake. They say he\'s going\r\nto marry Sally Jones. That may take it out of him. I do like the\r\nfarms to go from father to son, Everett. It\'s the way that everything\r\nshould go. Of course there\'s no right."\r\n\r\n"Nothing of that kind, I suppose," said Everett, who was in his way a\r\nreformer, and had Radical notions with which he would not for worlds\r\nhave disturbed the baronet at present.\r\n\r\n"No;--nothing of that kind. God in his mercy forbid that a landlord\r\nin England should ever be robbed after that fashion." Sir Alured,\r\nwhen he was uttering this prayer, was thinking of what he had heard\r\nof an Irish Land Bill, the details of which, however, had been\r\naltogether incomprehensible to him. "But I have a feeling about it,\r\nEverett; and I hope you will share it. It is good that things should\r\ngo from father to son. I never make a promise; but the tenants know\r\nwhat I think about it, and then the father works for the son. Why\r\nshould he work for a stranger? Sally Jones is a very good young\r\nwoman, and perhaps young John will do better." There was not a field\r\nor a fence that he did not show to his heir;--hardly a tree which he\r\nleft without a word. "That bit of woodland coming in there,--they\r\ncall it Barnton Spinnies,--doesn\'t belong to the estate at all." This\r\nhe said in a melancholy tone.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t it, really?"\r\n\r\n"And it comes right in between Lane\'s farm and Puddock\'s. They\'ve\r\nalways let me have the shooting as a compliment. Not that there\'s\r\never anything in it. It\'s only seven acres. But I like the civility."\r\n\r\n"Who does it belong to?"\r\n\r\n"It belongs to Benet."\r\n\r\n"What; Corpus Christi?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes;--they\'ve changed the name. It used to be Benet in my days.\r\nWalker says the College would certainly sell, but you\'d have to pay\r\nfor the land and the wood separately. I don\'t know that you\'d get\r\nmuch out of it; but it\'s very unsightly,--on the survey map, I mean."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll buy it, by all means," said Everett, who was already jingling\r\nhis L60,000 in his pocket.\r\n\r\n"I never had the money, but I think it should be bought." And Sir\r\nAlured rejoiced in the idea that when his ghost should look at the\r\nsurvey map, that hiatus of Barnton Spinnies would not trouble his\r\nspectral eyes.\r\n\r\nIn this way months ran on at Wharton. Our Whartons had come down\r\nin the latter half of August, and at the beginning of September Mr.\r\nWharton returned to London. Everett, of course, remained, as he\r\nwas still learning the lesson of which he was in truth becoming a\r\nlittle weary; and at last Emily had also been persuaded to stay in\r\nHerefordshire. Her father promised to return, not mentioning any\r\nprecise time, but giving her to understand that he would come before\r\nthe winter. He went, and probably found that his taste for the Eldon\r\nand for whist had returned to him. In the middle of November old Mrs.\r\nFletcher arrived. Emily was not aware of what was being done; but,\r\nin truth, the Fletchers and Whartons combined were conspiring with\r\nthe view of bringing her back to her former self. Mrs. Fletcher had\r\nnot yielded without some difficulty,--for it was a part of this\r\nconspiracy that Arthur was to be allowed to marry the widow. But John\r\nhad prevailed. "He\'ll do it any way, mother," he had said, "whether\r\nyou and I like it or not. And why on earth shouldn\'t he do as he\r\npleases?"\r\n\r\n"Think what the man was, John!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s more to the purpose to think what the woman is. Arthur has made\r\nup his mind, and, if I know him, he\'s not the man to be talked out of\r\nit." And so the old woman had given in, and had at last consented to\r\ngo forward as the advanced guard of the Fletchers, and lay siege to\r\nthe affections of the woman whom she had once so thoroughly discarded\r\nfrom her heart.\r\n\r\n"My dear," she said, when they first met, "if there has been anything\r\nwrong between you and me, let it be among the things that are past.\r\nYou always used to kiss me. Give me a kiss now." Of course Emily\r\nkissed her; and after that Mrs. Fletcher patted her and petted her,\r\nand gave her lozenges, which she declared in private to be "the\r\nsovereignest thing on earth" for debilitated nerves. And then it came\r\nout by degrees that John Fletcher and his wife and all the little\r\nFletchers were coming to Wharton for the Christmas weeks. Everett had\r\ngone, but was also to be back for Christmas, and Mr. Wharton\'s visit\r\nwas also postponed. It was absolutely necessary that Everett should\r\nbe at Wharton for the Christmas festivities, and expedient that\r\nEverett\'s father should be there to see them. In this way Emily had\r\nno means of escape. Her father wrote telling her of his plans, saying\r\nthat he would bring her back after Christmas. Everett\'s heirship\r\nhad made these Christmas festivities,--which were, however, to be\r\nconfined to the two families,--quite a necessity. In all this not a\r\nword was said about Arthur, nor did she dare to ask whether he was\r\nexpected. The younger Mrs. Fletcher, John\'s wife, opened her arms\r\nto the widow in a manner that almost plainly said that she regarded\r\nEmily as her future sister-in-law. John Fletcher talked to her about\r\nLongbarns, and the children,--complete Fletcher talk,--as though she\r\nwere already one of them, never, however, mentioning Arthur\'s name.\r\nThe old lady got down a fresh supply of the lozenges from London\r\nbecause those she had by her might perhaps be a little stale. And\r\nthen there was another sign which after a while became plain to\r\nEmily. No one in either family ever mentioned her name. It was\r\nnot singular that none of them should call her Mrs. Lopez, as she\r\nwas Emily to all of them. But they never so described her even in\r\nspeaking to the servants. And the servants themselves, as far as was\r\npossible, avoided the odious word. The thing was to be buried, if not\r\nin oblivion, yet in some speechless grave. And it seemed that her\r\nfather was joined in this attempt. When writing to her he usually\r\nmade some excuse for writing also to Everett, or, in Everett\'s\r\nabsence, to the baronet,--so that the letter for his daughter might\r\nbe enclosed and addressed simply to "Emily".\r\n\r\nShe understood it all, and though she was moved to continual solitary\r\ntears by this ineffable tenderness, yet she rebelled against them.\r\nThey should never cheat her back into happiness by such wiles as\r\nthat! It was not fit that she should yield to them. As a woman\r\nutterly disgraced it could not become her again to laugh and be\r\njoyful, to give and take loving embraces, to sit and smile, perhaps\r\na happy mother, at another man\'s hearth. For their love she was\r\ngrateful. For his love she was more than grateful. How constant must\r\nbe his heart, how grand his nature, how more than manly his strength\r\nof character, when he was thus true to her through all the evil she\r\nhad done! Love him! Yes;--she would pray for him, worship him, fill\r\nthe remainder of her days with thinking of him, hoping for him, and\r\nmaking his interests her own. Should he ever be married,--and she\r\nwould pray that he might,--his wife, if possible, should be her\r\nfriend, his children should be her darlings; and he should always be\r\nher hero. But they should not, with all their schemes, cheat her into\r\ndisgracing him by marrying him.\r\n\r\nAt last her father came, and it was he who told her that Arthur\r\nwas expected on the day before Christmas. "Why did you not tell me\r\nbefore, papa, so that I might have asked you to take me away?"\r\n\r\n"Because I thought, my dear, that it was better that you should be\r\nconstrained to meet him. You would not wish to live all your life in\r\nterror of seeing Arthur Fletcher?"\r\n\r\n"Not all my life."\r\n\r\n"Take the plunge and it will be over. They have all been very good to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Too good, papa. I didn\'t want it."\r\n\r\n"They are our oldest friends. There isn\'t a young man in England I\r\nthink so highly of as John Fletcher. When I am gone, where are you to\r\nlook for friends?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not ungrateful, papa."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t know them all, and yet keep yourself altogether separated\r\nfrom Arthur. Think what it would be to me never to be able to ask him\r\nto the house. He is the only one of the family that lives in London,\r\nand now it seems that Everett will spend most of his time down here.\r\nOf course it is better that you should meet him and have done with\r\nit." There was no answer to be made to this, but still she was fixed\r\nin her resolution that she would never meet him as her lover.\r\n\r\nThen came the morning of the day on which he was to arrive, and his\r\ncoming was for the first time spoken openly of at breakfast. "How is\r\nArthur to be brought from the station?" asked old Mrs. Fletcher.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to take the dog-cart," said Everett. "Giles will go for\r\nthe luggage with the pony. He is bringing down a lot of things;--a\r\nnew saddle, and a gun for me." It had all been arranged for her, this\r\nquestion and answer, and Emily blushed as she felt that it was so.\r\n\r\n"We shall be so glad to see Arthur," said young Mrs. Fletcher to her.\r\n\r\n"Of course you will."\r\n\r\n"He has not been down since the Session was over, and he has got to\r\nbe quite a speaking man now. I do so hope he\'ll become something some\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he will," said Emily.\r\n\r\n"Not a judge, however. I hate wigs. Perhaps he might be Lord\r\nChancellor in time." Mrs. Fletcher was not more ignorant than some\r\nother ladies in being unaware of the Lord Chancellor\'s wig and exact\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nAt last he came. The 9 A.M. express for Hereford,--express, at least,\r\nfor the first two or three hours out of London,--brought passengers\r\nfor Wharton to the nearest station at 3 P.M., and the distance was\r\nnot above five miles. Before four o\'clock Arthur was standing before\r\nthe drawing-room fire, with a cup of tea in his hand, surrounded by\r\nFletchers and Whartons, and being made much of as the young family\r\nmember of Parliament. But Emily was not in the room. She had studied\r\nher Bradshaw, and learned the hours of the trains, and was now in her\r\nbedroom. He had looked around the moment he entered the room, but had\r\nnot dared to ask for her suddenly. He had said one word about her to\r\nEverett in the cart, and that had been all. She was in the house, and\r\nhe must, at any rate, see her before dinner.\r\n\r\nEmily, in order that she might not seem to escape abruptly, had\r\nretired early to her solitude. But she, too, knew that the meeting\r\ncould not be long postponed. She sat thinking of it all, and at\r\nlast heard the wheels of the vehicle before the door. She paused,\r\nlistening with all her ears, that she might recognise his voice, or\r\npossibly his footstep. She stood near the window, behind the curtain,\r\nwith her hand pressed to her heart. She heard Everett\'s voice plainly\r\nas he gave some direction to the groom, but from Arthur she heard\r\nnothing. Yet she was sure that he was come. The very manner of the\r\napproach and her brother\'s word made her certain that there had been\r\nno disappointment. She stood thinking for a quarter of an hour,\r\nmaking up her mind how best they might meet. Then suddenly, with slow\r\nbut certain step, she walked down into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nNo one expected her then, or something perhaps might have been done\r\nto encourage her coming. It had been thought that she must meet him\r\nbefore dinner, and her absence till then was to be excused. But now\r\nshe opened the door, and with much dignity of mien walked into the\r\nmiddle of the room. Arthur at that moment was discussing the Duke\'s\r\nchance for the next Session, and Sir Alured was asking with rapture\r\nwhether the old Conservative party would not come in. Arthur Fletcher\r\nheard the step, turned round, and saw the woman he loved. He went at\r\nonce to meet her, very quickly, and put out both his hands. She gave\r\nhim hers, of course. There was no excuse for her refusal. He stood\r\nfor an instant pressing them, looking eagerly into her sad face, and\r\nthen he spoke. "God bless you, Emily!" he said, "God bless you!" He\r\nhad thought of no words, and at the moment nothing else occurred to\r\nhim to be said. The colour had covered all his face, and his heart\r\nbeat so strongly that he was hardly his own master. She let him hold\r\nher two hands, perhaps for a minute, and then, bursting into tears,\r\ntore herself from him, and, hurrying out of the room, made her way\r\nagain into her own chamber. "It will be better so," said old Mrs.\r\nFletcher. "It will be better so. Do not let any one follow her."\r\n\r\nOn that day John Fletcher took her out to dinner, and Arthur did not\r\nsit near her. In the evening he came to her as she was working close\r\nto his mother, and seated himself on a low chair close to her knees.\r\n"We are all so glad to see you; are we not, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," said Mrs. Fletcher. Then, after a while, the old woman\r\ngot up to make a rubber at whist with the two old men and her eldest\r\nson, leaving Arthur sitting at the widow\'s knee. She would willingly\r\nhave escaped, but it was impossible that she should move.\r\n\r\n"You need not be afraid of me," he said, not whispering, but in a\r\nvoice which no one else could hear. "Do not seem to avoid me, and I\r\nwill say nothing to trouble you. I think that you must wish that we\r\nshould be friends."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"Come out, then, to-morrow, when we are walking. In that way we shall\r\nget used to each other. You are troubled now, and I will go." Then\r\nhe left her, and she felt herself to be bound to him by infinite\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nA week went on and she had become used to his company. A week passed\r\nand he had spoken no word to her that a brother might not have\r\nspoken. They had walked together when no one else had been within\r\nhearing, and yet he had spared her. She had begun to think that he\r\nwould spare her altogether, and she was certainly grateful. Might\r\nit not be that she had misunderstood him, and had misunderstood the\r\nmeaning of them all? Might it not be that she had troubled herself\r\nwith false anticipations? Surely it was so; for how could it be that\r\nsuch a man should wish to make such a woman his wife?\r\n\r\n"Well, Arthur?" said his brother to him one day.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to say about it," said Arthur.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t changed your mind?"\r\n\r\n"Never! Upon my word, to me, in that dress, she is more beautiful\r\nthan ever."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would make her take it off."\r\n\r\n"I dare not ask her yet."\r\n\r\n"You know what they say about widows generally, my boy."\r\n\r\n"That is all very well when one talks about widows in general. It\r\nis easy to chaff about women when one hasn\'t got any woman in one\'s\r\nmind. But as it is now, having her here, loving her as I do,--by\r\nheaven! I cannot hurry her. I don\'t dare to speak to her after that\r\nfashion. I shall do it in time, I suppose;--but I must wait till the\r\ntime comes."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI\r\n\r\nThe Ladies at Longbarns Doubt\r\n\r\n\r\nIt came at last to be decided among them that when old Mr. Wharton\r\nreturned to town,--and he had now been at Wharton longer than he had\r\never been known to remain there before,--Emily should still remain in\r\nHerefordshire, and that at some period not then fixed she should go\r\nfor a month to Longbarns. There were various reasons which induced\r\nher to consent to this change of plans. In the first place she found\r\nherself to be infinitely more comfortable in the country than in\r\ntown. She could go out and move about and bestir herself, whereas in\r\nManchester Square she could only sit and mope at home. Her father had\r\nassured her that he thought that it would be better that she should\r\nbe away from the reminiscences of the house in town. And then when\r\nthe first week of February was past Arthur would be up in town, and\r\nshe would be far away from him at Longbarns, whereas in London she\r\nwould be close within his reach. Many little schemes were laid and\r\nstruggles made both by herself and the others before at last their\r\nplans were settled. Mr. Wharton was to return to London in the middle\r\nof January. It was quite impossible that he could remain longer away\r\neither from Stone Buildings or from the Eldon, and then at the same\r\ntime, or a day or two following, Mrs. Fletcher was to go back to\r\nLongbarns. John Fletcher and his wife and children were already\r\ngone,--and Arthur also had been at Longbarns. The two brothers and\r\nEverett had been backwards and forwards. Emily was anxious to remain\r\nat Wharton at any rate till Parliament should have met, so that she\r\nmight not be at home with Arthur in his own house. But matters would\r\nnot arrange themselves exactly as she wished. It was at last settled\r\nthat she should go to Longbarns with Mary Wharton under the charge\r\nof John Fletcher in the first week in February. As arrangements were\r\nalready in progress for the purchase of Barnton Spinnies, Sir Alured\r\ncould not possibly leave his own house. Not to have walked through\r\nthe wood on the first day that it became a part of the Wharton\r\nproperty would to him have been treason to the estate. His experience\r\nought to have told him that there was no chance of a lawyer and a\r\ncollege dealing together with such rapidity; but in the present state\r\nof things he could not bear to absent himself. Orders had already\r\nbeen given for the cutting down of certain trees which could not have\r\nbeen touched had the reprobate lived, and it was indispensable that\r\nif a tree fell at Wharton he should see the fall. It thus came to\r\npass that there was a week during which Emily would be forced to live\r\nunder the roof of the Fletchers together with Arthur Fletcher.\r\n\r\nThe week came and she was absolutely received by Arthur at the door\r\nof Longbarns. She had not been at the house since it had first been\r\nintimated to the Fletchers that she was disposed to receive with\r\nfavour the addresses of Ferdinand Lopez. As she remembered this it\r\nseemed to her to be an age ago since that man had induced her to\r\nbelieve that of all men she had ever met he was the nearest to a\r\nhero. She never spoke of him now, but of course her thoughts of\r\nhim were never ending,--as also of herself in that she had allowed\r\nherself to be so deceived. She would recall to her mind with bitter\r\ninward sobbings all those lessons of iniquity which he had striven\r\nto teach her, and which had first opened her eyes to his true\r\ncharacter,--how sedulously he had endeavoured to persuade her that\r\nit was her duty to rob her father on his behalf, how continually he\r\nhad endeavoured to make her think that appearance in the world was\r\neverything, and that, being in truth poor adventurers, it behoved\r\nthem to cheat the world into thinking them rich and respectable.\r\nEvery hint that had been so given had been a wound to her, and those\r\nwounds were all now remembered. Though since his death she had never\r\nallowed a word to be spoken in her presence against him, she could\r\nnot but hate his memory. How glorious was that other man in her\r\neyes, as he stood there at the door welcoming her to Longbarns,\r\nfair-haired, open-eyed, with bronzed brow and cheek, and surely the\r\nhonestest face that a loving woman ever loved to gaze on. During the\r\nvarious lessons she had learned in her married life, she had become\r\ngradually but surely aware that the face of that other man had been\r\ndishonest. She had learned the false meaning of every glance of his\r\neyes, the subtlety of his mouth, the counterfeit manoeuvres of\r\nhis body,--the deceit even of his dress. He had been all a lie from\r\nhead to foot; and he had thrown her love aside as useless when she\r\nalso would not be a liar. And here was this man,--spotless in her\r\nestimation, compounded of all good qualities, which she could now see\r\nand take at their proper value. She hated herself for the simplicity\r\nwith which she had been cheated by soft words and a false demeanour\r\ninto so great a sacrifice.\r\n\r\nLife at Longbarns was very quiet during the days which she passed\r\nthere before he left them. She was frequently alone with him, but he,\r\nif he still loved her, did not speak of his love. He explained it\r\nall one day to his mother. "If it is to be," said the old lady, "I\r\ndon\'t see the use of more delay. Of course the marriage ought not to\r\nbe till March twelvemonths. But if it is understood that it is to\r\nbe, she might alter her dress by degrees,--and alter her manner of\r\nliving. Those things should always be done by degrees. I think it had\r\nbetter be settled, Arthur, if it is to be settled."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid, mother."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! I didn\'t think you were the man ever to be afraid of a\r\nwoman. What can she say to you?"\r\n\r\n"Refuse me."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'d better know it at once. But I don\'t think she\'ll be fool\r\nenough for that."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you hardly understand her, mother."\r\n\r\nMrs. Fletcher shook her head with a look of considerable annoyance.\r\n"Perhaps not. But, to tell the truth, I don\'t like young women whom I\r\ncan\'t understand. Young women shouldn\'t be mysterious. I like people\r\nof whom I can give a pretty good guess what they\'ll do. I\'m sure I\r\nnever could have guessed that she would have married that man."\r\n\r\n"If you love me, mother, do not let that be mentioned between us\r\nagain. When I said that you did not understand her, I did not mean\r\nthat she was mysterious. I think that before he died, and since his\r\ndeath, she learned of what sort that man was. I will not say that she\r\nhates his memory, but she hates herself for what she has done."\r\n\r\n"So she ought," said Mrs. Fletcher.\r\n\r\n"She has not yet brought herself to think that her life should be\r\nanything but one long period of mourning, not for him, but for her\r\nown mistake. You may be quite sure that I am in earnest. It is not\r\nbecause I doubt of myself that I put it off. But I fear that if once\r\nshe asserts to me her resolution to remain as she is, she will feel\r\nherself bound to keep her word."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she is very much the same as other women, after all, my\r\ndear," said Mrs. Fletcher, who was almost jealous of the peculiar\r\nsuperiority of sentiment which her son seemed to attribute to this\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n"Circumstances, mother, make people different," he replied.\r\n\r\n"So you are going without having anything fixed," his elder brother\r\nsaid to him the day before he started.\r\n\r\n"Yes, old fellow. It seems to be rather slack;--doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I dare say you know best what you\'re about. But if you have set your\r\nmind on it--"\r\n\r\n"You may take your oath on that."\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t see why one word shouldn\'t put it all right. There\r\nnever is any place so good for that kind of thing as a country\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that with her it will make much difference where the\r\nhouse is, or what the circumstances."\r\n\r\n"She knows what you mean as well as I do."\r\n\r\n"I dare say she does, John. She must have a very bad idea of me if\r\nshe doesn\'t. But she may know what I mean and not mean the same thing\r\nherself."\r\n\r\n"How are you to know if you don\'t ask her?"\r\n\r\n"You may be sure that I shall ask her as soon as I can hope that my\r\ndoing so may give her more pleasure than pain. Remember, I have had\r\nall this out with her father. I have determined that I will wait till\r\ntwelve months have passed since that wretched man perished."\r\n\r\nOn that afternoon before dinner he was alone with her in the library\r\nsome minutes before they went up to dress for dinner. "I shall hardly\r\nsee you to-morrow," he said, "as I must leave this at half-past\r\neight. I breakfast at eight. I don\'t suppose any one will be down\r\nexcept my mother."\r\n\r\n"I am generally as early as that. I will come down and see you\r\nstart."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad that you have been here, Emily."\r\n\r\n"So am I. Everybody has been so good to me."\r\n\r\n"It has been like old days,--almost."\r\n\r\n"It will never quite be like old days again, I think. But I have been\r\nvery glad to be here,--and at Wharton. I sometimes almost wish that I\r\nwere never going back to London again,--only for papa."\r\n\r\n"I like London myself."\r\n\r\n"You! Yes, of course you like London. You have everything in life\r\nbefore you. You have things to do, and much to hope for. It is all\r\nbeginning for you, Arthur."\r\n\r\n"I am five years older than you are."\r\n\r\n"What does that matter? It seems to me that age does not go by years.\r\nIt is long since I have felt myself to be an old woman. But you are\r\nquite young. Everybody is proud of you, and you ought to be happy."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said he. "It is hard to say what makes a person\r\nhappy." He almost made up his mind to speak to her then; but he had\r\nmade up his mind before to put it off still for a little time, and he\r\nwould not allow himself to be changed on the spur of the moment. He\r\nhad thought of it much, and he had almost taught himself to think\r\nthat it would be better for herself that she should not accept\r\nanother man\'s love so soon. "I shall come and see you in town," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"You must come and see papa. It seems that Everett is to be a great\r\ndeal at Wharton. I had better go up to dress now, or I shall be\r\nkeeping them waiting." He put out his hand to her, and wished her\r\ngood-bye, excusing himself by saying that they should not be alone\r\ntogether again before he started.\r\n\r\nShe saw him go on the next morning,--and then she almost felt herself\r\nto be abandoned, almost deserted. It was a fine crisp winter day, dry\r\nand fresh and clear, but with the frost still on the ground. After\r\nbreakfast she went out to walk by herself in the long shrubbery paths\r\nwhich went round the house, and here she remained for above an hour.\r\nShe told herself that she was very thankful to him for not having\r\nspoken to her on a subject so unfit for her ears as love. She\r\nstrengthened herself in her determination never again to listen to a\r\nman willingly on that subject. She had made herself unfit to have any\r\ndealings of that nature. It was not that she could not love. Oh, no!\r\nShe knew well enough that she did love,--love with all her heart. If\r\nit were not that she were so torn to rags that she was not fit to be\r\nworn again, she could now have thrown herself into his arms with a\r\nwhole heaven of joy before her. A woman, she told herself, had no\r\nright to a second chance in life, after having made such a shipwreck\r\nof herself in the first. But the danger of being seduced from her\r\njudgment by Arthur Fletcher was all over. He had been near her for\r\nthe last week and had not spoken a word. He had been in the same\r\nhouse with her for the last ten days and had been with her as a\r\nbrother might be with his sister. It was not only she who had\r\nseen the propriety of this. He also had acknowledged it, and she\r\nwas--grateful to him. As she endeavoured in her solitude to express\r\nher gratitude in spoken words the tears rolled down her cheeks.\r\nShe was glad, she told herself, very glad that it was so. How much\r\ntrouble and pain to both of them would thus be spared! And yet her\r\ntears were bitter tears. It was better as it was;--and yet one word\r\nof love would have been very sweet. She almost thought that she would\r\nhave liked to tell him that for his sake, for his dear sake, she\r\nwould refuse--that which now would never be offered to her. She was\r\nquite clear as to the rectitude of her own judgment, clear as ever.\r\nAnd yet her heart was heavy with disappointment.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of March before she left Herefordshire for London,\r\nhaving spent the greater part of the time at Longbarns. The ladies at\r\nthat place were moved by many doubts as to what would be the end of\r\nall this. Mrs. Fletcher the elder at last almost taught herself to\r\nbelieve that there would be no marriage, and having got back to that\r\nbelief, was again opposed to the idea of a marriage. Anything and\r\neverything that Arthur wanted he ought to have. The old lady felt\r\nno doubt as to that. When convinced that he did want to have this\r\nwidow,--this woman whose life had hitherto been so unfortunate,--she\r\nhad for his sake taken the woman again by the hand, and had assisted\r\nin making her one of themselves. But how much better it would be that\r\nArthur should think better of it! It was the maddest constancy,--this\r\nclinging to the widow of such a man as Ferdinand Lopez! If there were\r\nany doubt, then she would be prepared to do all she could to prevent\r\nthe marriage. Emily had been forgiven, and the pardon bestowed must\r\nof course be continued. But she might be pardoned without being made\r\nMrs. Arthur Fletcher. While Emily was still at Longbarns the old lady\r\nalmost talked over her daughter-in-law to this way of thinking,--till\r\nJohn Fletcher put his foot upon it altogether. "I don\'t pretend to\r\nsay what she may do," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, John," said the mother, "to hear a man like you talk like that\r\nis absurd. She\'d jump at him if he looked at her with half an eye."\r\n\r\n"What she may do," he continued saying, without appearing to listen\r\nto his mother, "I cannot say. But that he will ask her to be his wife\r\nis as certain as that I stand here."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII\r\n\r\n"He Thinks That Our Days Are Numbered"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the details of the new County Suffrage Bill were settled at\r\nMatching during the recess between Mr. Monk, Phineas Finn, and a\r\nvery experienced gentleman from the Treasury, one Mr. Prime, who was\r\nsupposed to know more about such things than any man living, and was\r\nconsequently called Constitution Charlie. He was an elderly man, over\r\nsixty years of age, who remembered the first Reform Bill, and had\r\nbeen engaged in the doctoring of constituencies ever since. The\r\nBill, if passed, would be mainly his Bill, and yet the world would\r\nnever hear his name as connected with it. Let us hope that he was\r\ncomfortable at Matching, and that he found his consolation in the\r\nsmiles of the Duchess. During this time the old Duke was away, and\r\neven the Prime Minister was absent for some days. He would fain have\r\nbusied himself about the Bill himself, but was hardly allowed by his\r\ncolleagues to have any hand in framing it. The great points of the\r\nmeasure had of course been arranged in the Cabinet,--where, however,\r\nMr. Monk\'s views had been adopted almost without a change. It may not\r\nperhaps be too much to assume that one or two members of the Cabinet\r\ndid not quite understand the full scope of every suggested clause.\r\nThe effects which clauses will produce, the dangers which may be\r\nexpected from this or that change, the manner in which this or that\r\nproposition will come out in the washing, do not strike even Cabinet\r\nMinisters at a glance. A little study in a man\'s own cabinet, after\r\nthe reading perhaps of a few leading articles, and perhaps a short\r\nconversation with an astute friend or two, will enable a statesman\r\nto be strong at a given time for, or even, if necessary, against\r\na measure, who has listened in silence, and has perhaps given his\r\npersonal assent, to the original suggestion. I doubt whether Lord\r\nDrummond, when he sat silent in the Cabinet, had realised those fears\r\nwhich weighed upon him so strongly afterwards, or had then foreseen\r\nthat the adoption of a nearly similar franchise for the counties and\r\nboroughs must inevitably lead to the American system of numerical\r\nrepresentation. But when time had been given him, and he and Sir\r\nTimothy had talked it all over, the mind of no man was ever clearer\r\nthan that of Lord Drummond.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, with the diligence which belonged to him, had\r\nmastered all the details of Mr. Monk\'s Bill before it was discussed\r\nin the Cabinet, and yet he found that his assistance was hardly\r\nneeded in the absolute preparation. Had they allowed him he would\r\nhave done it all himself. But it was assumed that he would not\r\ntrouble himself with such work, and he perceived that he was not\r\nwanted. Nothing of moment was settled without a reference to him. He\r\nrequired that everything should be explained as it went on, down to\r\nthe extension of every borough boundary; but he knew that he was not\r\ndoing it himself, and that Mr. Monk and Constitution Charlie had the\r\nprize between them.\r\n\r\nNor did he dare to ask Mr. Monk what would be the fate of the Bill.\r\nTo devote all one\'s time and mind and industry to a measure which\r\none knows will fall to the ground must be sad. Work under such\r\ncircumstances must be very grievous. But such is often the fate of\r\nstatesmen. Whether Mr. Monk laboured under such a conviction the\r\nPrime Minister did not know, though he saw his friend and colleague\r\nalmost daily. In truth no one dared to tell him exactly what he\r\nthought. Even the old Duke had become partially reticent, and taken\r\nhimself off to his own woods at Long Royston. To Phineas Finn the\r\nPrime Minister would sometimes say a word, but would say even\r\nthat timidly. On any abstract question, such as that which he had\r\ndiscussed when they had been walking together, he could talk freely\r\nenough. But on the matter of the day, those affairs which were of\r\ninfinite importance to himself, and on which one would suppose he\r\nwould take delight in speaking to a trusted colleague, he could not\r\nbring himself to be open. "It must be a long Bill, I suppose?" he\r\nsaid to Phineas one day.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so, Duke. It will run, I fear, to over a hundred\r\nclauses."\r\n\r\n"It will take you the best part of the Session to get through it?"\r\n\r\n"If we can have the second reading early in March, we hope to send it\r\nup to you in the first week in June. That will give us ample time."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--yes. I suppose so." But he did not dare to ask Phineas Finn\r\nwhether he thought that the House of Commons would assent to the\r\nsecond reading. It was known at this time that the Prime Minister was\r\npainfully anxious as to the fate of the Ministry. It seemed to be but\r\nthe other day that everybody connected with the Government was living\r\nin fear lest he should resign. His threats in that direction had\r\nalways been made to his old friend the Duke of St. Bungay; but a\r\ngreat man cannot whisper his thoughts without having them carried in\r\nthe air. In all the clubs it had been declared that that was the rock\r\nby which the Coalition would probably be wrecked. The newspapers had\r\nrepeated the story, and the "People\'s Banner" had assured the world\r\nthat if it were so the Duke of Omnium would thus do for his country\r\nthe only good service which it was possible that he should render it.\r\nThat was at the time when Sir Orlando was mutinous and when Lopez had\r\ndestroyed himself. But now no such threat came from the Duke, and\r\nthe "People\'s Banner" was already accusing him of clinging to power\r\nwith pertinacious and unconstitutional tenacity. Had not Sir Orlando\r\ndeserted him? Was it not well known that Lord Drummond and Sir\r\nTimothy Beeswax were only restrained from doing so by a mistaken\r\nloyalty?\r\n\r\nEverybody came up to town, Mr. Monk having his Bill in his pocket,\r\nand the Queen\'s speech was read, promising the County Suffrage Bill.\r\nThe address was voted with a very few words from either side. The\r\nbattle was not to be fought then. Indeed, the state of things was\r\nso abnormal that there could hardly be said to be any sides in the\r\nHouse. A stranger in the gallery, not knowing the condition of\r\naffairs, would have thought that no minister had for many years\r\ncommanded so large a majority, as the crowd of members was always on\r\nthe Government side of the House; but the opposition which Mr. Monk\r\nexpected would, he knew, come from those who sat around him, behind\r\nhim, and even at his very elbow. About a week after Parliament met\r\nthe Bill was read for the first time, and the second reading was\r\nappointed for an early day in March.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had suggested to Mr. Monk the expedience of some further\r\ndelay, giving as his reason the necessity of getting through certain\r\nroutine work, should the rejection of the Bill create the confusion\r\nof a resignation. No one who knew the Duke could ever suspect him of\r\ngiving a false reason. But it seemed that in this the Prime Minister\r\nwas allowing himself to be harassed by fears of the future. Mr. Monk\r\nthought that any delay would be injurious and open to suspicion\r\nafter what had been said and done, and was urgent in his arguments.\r\nThe Duke gave way, but he did so almost sullenly, signifying his\r\nacquiescence with haughty silence. "I am sorry," said Mr. Monk,\r\n"to differ from your Grace, but my opinion in the matter is so\r\nstrong that I do not dare to abstain from expressing it." The Duke\r\nbowed again and smiled. He had intended that the smile should be\r\nacquiescent, but it had been as cold as steel. He knew that he was\r\nmisbehaving, but was not sufficiently master of his own manner to be\r\ngracious. He told himself on the spot,--though he was quite wrong in\r\nso telling himself,--that he had now made an enemy also of Mr. Monk,\r\nand through Mr. Monk of Phineas Finn. And now he felt that he had no\r\nfriend left in whom to trust,--for the old Duke had become cold and\r\nindifferent. The old Duke, he thought, was tired of his work and\r\nanxious for rest. It was the old Duke who had brought him into this\r\nhornets\' nest; had fixed upon his back the unwilling load; had\r\ncompelled him to assume the place which now to lose would be a\r\ndisgrace,--and the old Duke was now deserting him! He was sore\r\nall over, angry with every one, ungracious even with his private\r\nSecretary and his wife,--and especially miserable because he was\r\nthoroughly aware of his own faults. And yet, through it all, there\r\nwas present to him a desire to fight on to the very last. Let his\r\ncolleagues do what they might, and say what they might, he would\r\nremain Prime Minister of England as long as he was supported by a\r\nmajority of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n"I do not know any greater step than this," Phineas said to him\r\npleasantly one day, speaking of their new measure, "towards that\r\nmillennium of which we were talking at Matching, if we can only\r\naccomplish it."\r\n\r\n"Those moral speculations, Mr. Finn," he said, "will hardly bear the\r\nwear and tear of real life." The words of the answer, combined with\r\nthe manner in which they were spoken, were stern and almost uncivil.\r\nPhineas, at any rate, had done nothing to offend him. The Duke\r\npaused, trying to find some expression by which he might correct the\r\ninjury he had done; but, not finding any, passed on without further\r\nspeech. Phineas shrugged his shoulders and went his way, telling\r\nhimself that he had received one further injunction not to put his\r\ntrust in princes.\r\n\r\n"We shall be beaten, certainly," said Mr. Monk to Phineas, not long\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n"What makes you so sure?"\r\n\r\n"I smell it in the air. I see it in men\'s faces."\r\n\r\n"And yet it\'s a moderate Bill. They\'ll have to pass something\r\nstronger before long if they throw it out now."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the Bill that they\'ll reject, but us. We have served our\r\nturn, and we ought to go."\r\n\r\n"The House is tired of the Duke?"\r\n\r\n"The Duke is so good a man that I hardly like to admit even\r\nthat;--but I fear it is so. He is fretful and he makes enemies."\r\n\r\n"I sometimes think that he is ill."\r\n\r\n"He is ill at ease and sick at heart. He cannot hide his chagrin, and\r\nthen is doubly wretched because he has betrayed it. I do not know\r\nthat I ever respected and, at the same time, pitied a man more\r\nthoroughly."\r\n\r\n"He snubbed me awfully yesterday," said Phineas, laughing.\r\n\r\n"He cannot help himself. He snubs me at every word that he speaks,\r\nand yet I believe that he is most anxious to be civil to me. His\r\nministry has been of great service to the country. For myself, I\r\nshall never regret having joined it. But I think that to him it has\r\nbeen a continual sorrow."\r\n\r\nThe system on which the Duchess had commenced her career as wife of\r\nthe Prime Minister had now been completely abandoned. In the first\r\nplace, she had herself become so weary of it that she had been unable\r\nto continue the exertion. She had, too, become in some degree ashamed\r\nof her failures. The names of Major Pountney and Mr. Lopez were not\r\nnow pleasant to her ears, nor did she look back with satisfaction on\r\nthe courtesies she had lavished on Sir Orlando or the smiles she had\r\ngiven to Sir Timothy Beeswax. "I\'ve known a good many vulgar people\r\nin my time," she said one day to Mrs. Finn, "but none ever so vulgar\r\nas our ministerial supporters. You don\'t remember Mr. Bott, my dear.\r\nHe was before your time;--one of the arithmetical men, and a great\r\nfriend of Plantagenet\'s. He was very bad, but there have come up\r\nworse since him. Sometimes, I think, I like a little vulgarity for a\r\nchange; but, upon my honour, when we get rid of all this it will be a\r\npleasure to go back to ladies and gentlemen." This the Duchess said\r\nin her extreme bitterness.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that you have pretty well got rid of \'all this\'\r\nalready."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t got anybody else in their place. I have almost made up\r\nmy mind not to ask any one into the house for the next twelve months.\r\nI used to think that nothing would ever knock me up, but now I feel\r\nthat I\'m almost done for. I hardly dare open my mouth to Plantagenet.\r\nThe Duke of St. Bungay has cut me. Mr. Monk looks as ominous as an\r\nowl; and your husband hasn\'t a word to say left. Barrington Erle\r\nhides his face and passes by when he sees me. Mr. Rattler did try to\r\ncomfort me the other day by saying that everything was at sixes and\r\nsevens, and I really took it almost as a compliment to be spoken to.\r\nDon\'t you think Plantagenet is ill?"\r\n\r\n"He is careworn."\r\n\r\n"A man may be worn by care till there comes to be nothing left of\r\nhim. But he never speaks of giving up now. The old Bishop of St.\r\nAustell talks of resigning, and he has already made up his mind who\r\nis to have the see. He used to consult the Duke about all these\r\nthings, but I don\'t think he ever consults any one now. He never\r\nforgave the Duke about Lord Earlybird. Certainly, if a man wants to\r\nquarrel with all his friends, and to double the hatred of all his\r\nenemies, he had better become Prime Minister."\r\n\r\n"Are you really sorry that such was his fate, Lady Glen?"\r\n\r\n"Ah,--I sometimes ask myself that question, but I never get at an\r\nanswer. I should have thought him a poltroon if he had declined. It\r\nis to be the greatest man in the greatest country in the world. Do\r\never so little and the men who write history must write about you.\r\nAnd no man has ever tried to be nobler than he till,--till--."\r\n\r\n"Make no exception. If he be careworn and ill and weary, his manners\r\ncannot be the same as they were, but his purity is the same as ever."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that it would remain so. I believe in him, Marie, more\r\nthan in any man,--but I believe in none thoroughly. There is a devil\r\ncreeps in upon them when their hands are strengthened. I do not know\r\nwhat I would have wished. Whenever I do wish, I always wish wrong.\r\nAh, me; when I think of all those people I had down at Gatherum,--of\r\nthe trouble I took, and of the glorious anticipations in which I\r\nrevelled, I do feel ashamed of myself. Do you remember when I was\r\ndetermined that that wretch should be member for Silverbridge?"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t seen her since, Duchess?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I mean to see her. I couldn\'t make her first husband member,\r\nand therefore the man who is member is to be her second husband. But\r\nI\'m almost sick of schemes. Oh, dear, I wish I knew something that\r\nwas really pleasant to do. I have never really enjoyed anything since\r\nI was in love, and I only liked that because it was wicked."\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was wrong in saying that the Duke of St. Bungay had cut\r\nthem. The old man still remembered the kiss and still remembered\r\nthe pledge. But he had found it very difficult to maintain his old\r\nrelations with his friend. It was his opinion that the Coalition had\r\ndone all that was wanted from it, and that now had come the time\r\nwhen they might retire gracefully. It is, no doubt, hard for a Prime\r\nMinister to find an excuse for going. But if the Duke of Omnium would\r\nhave been content to acknowledge that he was not the man to alter\r\nthe County Suffrage, an excuse might have been found that would have\r\nbeen injurious to no one. Mr. Monk and Mr. Gresham might have joined,\r\nand the present Prime Minister might have resigned, explaining that\r\nhe had done all that he had been appointed to accomplish. He had,\r\nhowever, yielded at once to Mr. Monk, and now it was to be feared\r\nthat the House of Commons would not accept the Bill from his hands.\r\nIn such a state of things,--especially after that disagreement about\r\nLord Earlybird,--it was difficult for the old Duke to tender his\r\nadvice. He was at every Cabinet Council; he always came when his\r\npresence was required; he was invariably good-humoured;--but it\r\nseemed to him that his work was done. He could hardly volunteer to\r\ntell his chief and his colleague that he would certainly be beaten in\r\nthe House of Commons, and that therefore there was little more now\r\nto be done than to arrange the circumstances of their retirement.\r\nNevertheless, as the period for the second reading of the Bill came\r\non, he resolved that he would discuss the matter with his friend. He\r\nowed it to himself to do so, and he also owed it to the man whom he\r\nhad certainly placed in his present position. On himself politics had\r\nimposed a burden very much lighter than that which they had inflicted\r\non his more energetic and much less practical colleague. Through his\r\nlong life he had either been in office, or in such a position that\r\nmen were sure that he would soon return to it. He had taken it, when\r\nit had come, willingly, and had always left it without a regret. As\r\na man cuts in and out at a whist table, and enjoys both the game\r\nand the rest from the game, so had the Duke of St. Bungay been well\r\npleased in either position. He was patriotic, but his patriotism did\r\nnot disturb his digestion. He had been ambitious,--but moderately\r\nambitious, and his ambition had been gratified. It never occurred to\r\nhim to be unhappy because he or his party were beaten on a measure.\r\nWhen President of the Council, he could do his duty and enjoy London\r\nlife. When in opposition, he could linger in Italy till May and\r\ndevote his leisure to his trees and his bullocks. He was always\r\nesteemed, always self-satisfied, and always Duke of St. Bungay. But\r\nwith our Duke it was very different. Patriotism with him was a fever,\r\nand the public service an exacting mistress. As long as this had been\r\nall he had still been happy. Not trusting much in himself, he had\r\nnever aspired to great power. But now, now at last, ambition had laid\r\nhold of him,--and the feeling, not perhaps uncommon with such men,\r\nthat personal dishonour would be attached to political failure. What\r\nwould his future life be if he had so carried himself in his great\r\noffice as to have shown himself to be unfit to resume it? Hitherto\r\nany office had sufficed him in which he might be useful;--but now he\r\nmust either be Prime Minister, or a silent, obscure, and humbled man!\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR DUKE,\r\n\r\n   I will be with you to-morrow morning at 11 A.M., if you\r\n   can give me half-an-hour.\r\n\r\n   Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n   ST. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister received this note one afternoon, a day or two\r\nbefore that appointed for the second reading, and meeting his friend\r\nwithin an hour in the House of Lords, confirmed the appointment.\r\n"Shall I not rather come to you?" he said. But the old Duke, who\r\nlived in St. James\'s Square, declared that Carlton Terrace would be\r\nin his way to Downing Street; and so the matter was settled. Exactly\r\nat eleven the two Ministers met. "I don\'t like troubling you," said\r\nthe old man, "when I know that you have so much to think of."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I have but little to think of,--and my thoughts\r\nmust be very much engaged, indeed, when they shall be too full to\r\nadmit of my seeing you."\r\n\r\n"Of course we are all anxious about this Bill." The Prime Minister\r\nsmiled. Anxious! Yes, indeed. His anxiety was of such a nature that\r\nit kept him awake all night, and never for a moment left his mind\r\nfree by day. "And of course we must be prepared as to what shall be\r\ndone either in the event of success or of failure."\r\n\r\n"You might as well read that," said the other. "It only reached me\r\nthis morning, or I should have told you of it." The letter was a\r\ncommunication from the Solicitor-General containing his resignation.\r\nHe had now studied the County Suffrage Bill closely, and regretted\r\nto say that he could not give it a conscientious support. It was a\r\nmatter of sincerest sorrow to him that relations so pleasant should\r\nbe broken, but he must resign his place, unless, indeed, the clauses\r\nas to redistribution could be withdrawn. Of course he did not say\r\nthis as expecting that any such concession would be made to his\r\nopinion, but merely as indicating the matter on which his objection\r\nwas so strong as to over-rule all other considerations. All this he\r\nexplained at great length.\r\n\r\n"The pleasantness of the relations must have been on one side," said\r\nthe veteran. "He ought to have gone long since."\r\n\r\n"And Lord Drummond has already as good as said that unless we will\r\nabandon the same clauses, he must oppose the Bill in the Lords."\r\n\r\n"And resign, of course."\r\n\r\n"He meant that, I presume. Lord Ramsden has not spoken to me."\r\n\r\n"The clauses will not stick in his throat. Nor ought they. If the\r\nlawyers have their own way about law they should be contented."\r\n\r\n"The question is, whether in these circumstances we should postpone\r\nthe second reading?" asked the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said the other Duke. "As to the Solicitor-General\r\nyou will have no difficulty. Sir Timothy was only placed there as a\r\nconcession to his party. Drummond will no doubt continue to hold his\r\noffice till we see what is done in the Lower House. If the second\r\nreading be lost there,--why then his lordship can go with the rest of\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Rattler says we shall have a majority. He and Roby are quite agreed\r\nabout it. Between them they must know," said the Prime Minister,\r\nunintentionally pleading for himself.\r\n\r\n"They ought to know, if any men do;--but the crisis is exceptional.\r\nI suppose you think that if the second reading is lost we should\r\nresign?"\r\n\r\n"Oh,--certainly."\r\n\r\n"Or, after that, if the Bill be much mutilated in Committee? I don\'t\r\nknow that I shall personally break my own heart about the Bill. The\r\nexisting difference in the suffrages is rather in accordance with my\r\nprejudices. But the country desires the measure, and I suppose we\r\ncannot consent to any such material alteration as these men suggest."\r\nAs he spoke he laid his hand on Sir Timothy\'s letter.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Monk would not hear of it," said the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n"Of course not. And you and I in this measure must stick to Mr. Monk.\r\nMy great, indeed my only strong desire in the matter, is to act in\r\nstrict unison with you."\r\n\r\n"You are always good and true, Duke."\r\n\r\n"For my own part I shall not in the least regret to find in all this\r\nan opportunity of resigning. We have done our work, and if, as I\r\nbelieve, a majority of the House would again support either Gresham\r\nor Monk as the head of the entire Liberal party, I think that that\r\narrangement would be for the welfare of the country."\r\n\r\n"Why should it make any difference to you? Why should you not return\r\nto the Council?"\r\n\r\n"I should not do so;--certainly not at once; probably never. But\r\nyou,--who are in the very prime of your life--"\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister did not smile now. He knit his brows and a dark\r\nshadow came across his face. "I don\'t think I could do that," he\r\nsaid. "Caesar could hardly have led a legion under Pompey."\r\n\r\n"It has been done, greatly to the service of the country, and without\r\nthe slightest loss of honour or character in him who did it."\r\n\r\n"We need hardly talk of that, Duke. You think then that we shall\r\nfail;--fail, I mean, in the House of Commons. I do not know that\r\nfailure in our House should be regarded as fatal."\r\n\r\n"In three cases we should fail. The loss of any material clause in\r\nCommittee would be as bad as the loss of the Bill."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"And then, in spite of Messrs. Rattler and Roby,--who have been wrong\r\nbefore and may be wrong now,--we may lose the second reading."\r\n\r\n"And the third chance against us?"\r\n\r\n"You would not probably try to carry on the Bill with a very small\r\nmajority."\r\n\r\n"Not with three or four."\r\n\r\n"Nor, I think, with six or seven. It would be useless. My own belief\r\nis that we shall never carry the Bill into Committee."\r\n\r\n"I have always known you to be right, Duke."\r\n\r\n"I think that general opinion has set in that direction, and general\r\nopinion is generally right. Having come to that conclusion I thought\r\nit best to tell you, in order that we might have our house in order."\r\nThe Duke of Omnium, who with all his haughtiness and all his reserve,\r\nwas the simplest man in the world and the least apt to pretend to be\r\nthat which he was not, sighed deeply when he heard this. "For my own\r\npart," continued his elder, "I feel no regret that it should be so."\r\n\r\n"It is the first large measure that we have tried to carry."\r\n\r\n"We did not come in to carry large measures, my friend. Look back and\r\nsee how many large measures Pitt carried,--but he took the country\r\nsafely through its most dangerous crisis."\r\n\r\n"What have we done?"\r\n\r\n"Carried on the Queen\'s Government prosperously for three years. Is\r\nthat nothing for a minister to do? I have never been a friend of\r\ngreat measures, knowing that when they come fast, one after another,\r\nmore is broken in the rattle than is repaired by the reform. We have\r\ndone what Parliament and the country expected us to do, and to my\r\npoor judgment we have done it well."\r\n\r\n"I do not feel much self-satisfaction, Duke. Well;--we must see it\r\nout, and if it is as you anticipate, I shall be ready. Of course I\r\nhave prepared myself for it. And if, of late, my mind has been less\r\nturned to retirement than it used to be, it has only been because I\r\nhave become wedded to this measure, and have wished that it should be\r\ncarried under our auspices." Then the old Duke took his leave, and\r\nthe Prime Minister was left alone to consider the announcement that\r\nhad been made to him.\r\n\r\nHe had said that he had prepared himself, but, in so saying, he had\r\nhardly known himself. Hitherto, though he had been troubled by many\r\ndoubts, he had still hoped. The report made to him by Mr. Rattler,\r\nbacked as it had been by Mr. Roby\'s assurances, had almost sufficed\r\nto give him confidence. But Mr. Rattler and Mr. Roby combined were as\r\nnothing to the Duke of St. Bungay. The Prime Minister knew now,--he\r\nfelt that he knew, that his days were numbered. The resignation of\r\nthat lingering old bishop was not completed, and the person in whom\r\nhe believed would not have the see. He had meditated the making of\r\na peer or two, having hitherto been very cautious in that respect,\r\nbut he would do nothing of the kind if called upon by the House of\r\nCommons to resign with an uncompleted measure. But his thoughts soon\r\nran away from the present to the future. What was now to come of\r\nhimself? How should he use his future life,--he who as yet had not\r\npassed his forty-seventh year? He regretted much having made that\r\napparently pretentious speech about Caesar, though he knew his old\r\nfriend well enough to be sure that it would never be used against\r\nhim. Who was he that he should class himself among the big ones of\r\nthe world? A man may indeed measure small things by great, but the\r\nmeasurer should be careful to declare his own littleness when he\r\nillustrates his position by that of the topping ones of the earth.\r\nBut the thing said had been true. Let the Pompey be who he might, he,\r\nthe little Caesar of the day, could never now command another legion.\r\n\r\nHe had once told Phineas Finn that he regretted that he had abstained\r\nfrom the ordinary amusements of English gentlemen. But he had\r\nabstained also from their ordinary occupations,--except so far as\r\npolitics is one of them. He cared nothing for oxen or for furrows.\r\nIn regard to his own land he hardly knew whether the farms were large\r\nor small. He had been a scholar, and after a certain fitful fashion\r\nhe had maintained his scholarship, but the literature to which he\r\nhad been really attached had been that of blue-books and newspapers.\r\nWhat was he to do with himself when called upon to resign? And he\r\nunderstood,--or thought that he understood,--his position too well to\r\nexpect that after a while, with the usual interval, he might return\r\nto power. He had been Prime Minister, not as the leading politician\r\non either side, not as the king of a party, but,--so he told\r\nhimself,--as a stop-gap. There could be nothing for him now till the\r\ninsipidity of life should gradually fade away into the grave.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he got up and went off to his wife\'s apartment, the\r\nroom in which she used to prepare her triumphs and where now she\r\ncontemplated her disappointments. "I have had the Duke with me," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"What;--at last?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know that he could have done any good by coming sooner."\r\n\r\n"And what does his Grace say?"\r\n\r\n"He thinks that our days are numbered."\r\n\r\n"Psha!--is that all? I could have told him that ever so long ago. It\r\nwas hardly necessary that he should disturb himself at last to come\r\nand tell us such well-ventilated news. There isn\'t a porter at one of\r\nthe clubs who doesn\'t know it."\r\n\r\n"Then there will be the less surprise,--and to those who are\r\nconcerned perhaps the less mortification."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you who was to succeed you?" asked the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Not precisely."\r\n\r\n"He ought to have done that, as I am sure he knows. Everybody knows\r\nexcept you, Plantagenet."\r\n\r\n"If you know, you can tell me."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I can. It will be Mr. Monk."\r\n\r\n"With all my heart, Glencora. Mr. Monk is a very good man."\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether he\'ll do anything for us. Think how destitute we\r\nshall be! What if I were to ask him for a place! Would he not give it\r\nus?"\r\n\r\n"Will it make you unhappy, Cora?"\r\n\r\n"What;--your going?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--the change altogether."\r\n\r\nShe looked him in the face for a moment before she answered, with a\r\npeculiar smile in her eyes to which he was well used,--a smile half\r\nludicrous and half pathetic,--having in it also a dash of sarcasm.\r\n"I can dare to tell the truth," she said, "which you can\'t. I can be\r\nhonest and straightforward. Yes, it will make me unhappy. And you?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think that I cannot be honest too,--at any rate to you? It\r\ndoes fret me. I do not like to think that I shall be without work."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--Othello\'s occupation will be gone,--for awhile; for awhile."\r\nThen she came up to him and put both her hands on his breast. "But\r\nyet, Othello, I shall not be all unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Where will be your contentment?"\r\n\r\n"In you. It was making you ill. Rough people, whom the tenderness of\r\nyour nature could not well endure, trod upon you, and worried you\r\nwith their teeth and wounded you everywhere. I could have turned at\r\nthem again with my teeth, and given them worry for worry;--but you\r\ncould not. Now you will be saved from them, and so I shall not be\r\ndiscontented." All this she said looking up into his face, still with\r\nthat smile which was half pathetic and half ludicrous.\r\n\r\n"Then I will be contented too," he said as he kissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII\r\n\r\nOnly the Duke of Omnium\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night of the debate arrived, but before the debate was commenced\r\nSir Timothy Beeswax got up to make a personal explanation. He thought\r\nit right to state to the House how it came to pass that he found\r\nhimself bound to leave the Ministry at so important a crisis in its\r\nexistence. Then an observation was made by an honourable member of\r\nthe Government,--presumably in a whisper, but still loud enough to\r\ncatch the sharp ears of Sir Timothy, who now sat just below the\r\ngangway. It was said afterwards that the gentleman who made the\r\nobservation,--an Irish gentleman named Fitzgibbon, conspicuous rather\r\nfor his loyalty to his party than his steadiness,--had purposely\r\ntaken the place in which he then sat, that Sir Timothy might hear\r\nthe whisper. The whisper suggested that falling houses were often\r\nleft by certain animals. It was certainly a very loud whisper,--but,\r\nif gentlemen are to be allowed to whisper at all, it is almost\r\nimpossible to restrain the volume of the voice. To restrain Mr.\r\nFitzgibbon had always been found difficult. Sir Timothy, who did not\r\nlack pluck, turned at once upon his assailant, and declared that\r\nwords had been used with reference to himself which the honourable\r\nmember did not dare to get upon his legs and repeat. Larry\r\nFitzgibbon, as the gentleman was called, looked him full in the\r\nface, but did not move his hat from his head or stir a limb. It\r\nwas a pleasant little episode in the evening\'s work, and afforded\r\nsatisfaction to the House generally. Then Sir Timothy went on with\r\nhis explanation. The details of this measure, as soon as they were\r\nmade known to him, appeared to him, he said, to be fraught with\r\nthe gravest and most pernicious consequences. He was sure that the\r\nmembers of her Majesty\'s Government, who were hurrying on this\r\nmeasure with what he thought was indecent haste,--ministers are\r\nalways either indecent in their haste or treacherous in their\r\ndelay,--had not considered what they were doing, or, if they had\r\nconsidered, were blind as to its results. He then attempted to\r\ndiscuss the details of the measure, but was called to order. A\r\npersonal explanation could not be allowed to give him an opportunity\r\nof anticipating the debate. He contrived, however, before he sat\r\ndown, to say some very heavy things against his late chief, and\r\nespecially to congratulate the Duke on the services of the honourable\r\ngentleman, the member for Mayo,--meaning thereby Mr. Laurence\r\nFitzgibbon.\r\n\r\nIt would perhaps have been well for everybody if the measure could\r\nhave been withdrawn and the Ministry could have resigned without the\r\ndebate,--as everybody was convinced what would be the end of it. Let\r\nthe second reading go as it might, the Bill could not be carried.\r\nThere are measures which require the hopeful heartiness of a new\r\nMinistry, and the thorough-going energy of a young Parliament,--and\r\nthis was one of them. The House was as fully agreed that this change\r\nwas necessary, as it ever is agreed on any subject,--but still the\r\nthing could not be done. Even Mr. Monk, who was the most earnest of\r\nmen, felt the general slackness of all around him. The commotion\r\nand excitement which would be caused by a change of Ministry might\r\nrestore its proper tone to the House, but in its present condition it\r\nwas unfit for the work. Nevertheless Mr. Monk made his speech, and\r\nput all his arguments into lucid order. He knew it was for nothing,\r\nbut nevertheless it must be done. For hour after hour he went\r\non,--for it was necessary to give every detail of his contemplated\r\nproposition. He went through it as sedulously as though he had\r\nexpected to succeed, and sat down about nine o\'clock in the evening.\r\nThen Sir Orlando moved the adjournment of the House till the morrow,\r\ngiving as his reason for doing so the expedience of considering the\r\ndetails he had heard. To this no opposition was made, and the House\r\nwas adjourned.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the clubs were all alive with rumours as to the\r\ncoming debate. It was known that a strong party had been formed under\r\nthe auspices of Sir Orlando, and that with him Sir Timothy and other\r\npoliticians were in close council. It was of course necessary that\r\nthey should impart to many the secrets of their conclave, so that it\r\nwas known early in the afternoon that it was the intention of the\r\nOpposition not to discuss the Bill, but to move that it be read a\r\nsecond time that day six months. The Ministry had hardly expected\r\nthis, as the Bill was undoubtedly popular both in the House and the\r\ncountry; and if the Opposition should be beaten in such a course,\r\nthat defeat would tend greatly to strengthen the hands of the\r\nGovernment. But if the foe could succeed in carrying a positive\r\nveto on the second reading, it would under all the circumstances be\r\ntantamount to a vote of want of confidence. "I\'m afraid they know\r\nalmost more than we do as to the feeling of members," said Mr. Roby\r\nto Mr. Rattler.\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t a man in the House whose feeling in the matter I don\'t\r\nknow," said Rattler, "but I\'m not quite so sure of their principles.\r\nOn our own side, in our old party, there are a score of men who\r\ndetest the Duke, though they would fain be true to the Government.\r\nThey have voted with him through thick and thin, and he has not\r\nspoken a word to one of them since he became Prime Minister. What are\r\nyou to do with such a man? How are you to act with him?"\r\n\r\n"Lupton wrote to him the other day about something," answered the\r\nother, "I forget what, and he got a note back from Warburton as\r\ncold as ice,--an absolute slap in the face. Fancy treating a man\r\nlike Lupton in that way,--one of the most popular men in the House,\r\nrelated to half the peerage, and a man who thinks so much of himself!\r\nI shouldn\'t wonder if he were to vote against us;--I shouldn\'t\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"It has all been the old Duke\'s doing," said Rattler, "and no doubt\r\nit was intended for the best; but the thing has been a failure from\r\nthe beginning to the end. I knew it would be so. I don\'t think there\r\nhas been a single man who has understood what a Ministerial Coalition\r\nreally means except you and I. From the very beginning all your men\r\nwere averse to it in spirit."\r\n\r\n"Look how they were treated!" said Mr. Roby. "Was it likely that they\r\nshould be very staunch when Mr. Monk became Leader of the House?"\r\n\r\nThere was a Cabinet Council that day which lasted but a few minutes,\r\nand it may easily be presumed that the Ministers decided that they\r\nwould all resign at once if Sir Orlando should carry his amendment.\r\nIt is not unlikely that they were agreed to do the same if he should\r\nnearly carry it,--leaving probably the Prime Minister to judge what\r\nnarrow majority would constitute nearness. On this occasion all the\r\ngentlemen assembled were jocund in their manner, and apparently\r\nwell satisfied,--as though they saw before them an end to all their\r\ntroubles. The Spartan boy did not even make a grimace when the wolf\r\nbit him beneath his frock, and these were all Spartan boys. Even the\r\nPrime Minister, who had fortified himself for the occasion, and who\r\nnever wept in any company but that of his wife and his old friend,\r\nwas pleasant in his manner and almost affable. "We shan\'t make this\r\nstep towards the millennium just at present," he said to Phineas Finn\r\nas they left the room together,--referring to words which Phineas had\r\nspoken on a former occasion, and which then had not been very well\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n"But we shall have made a step towards the step," said Phineas, "and\r\nin getting to a millennium even that is something."\r\n\r\n"I suppose we are all too anxious," said the Duke, "to see some great\r\neffects come from our own little doings. Good-day. We shall know all\r\nabout it tolerably early. Monk seems to think that it will be an\r\nattack on the Ministry and not on the Bill, and that it will be best\r\nto get a vote with as little delay as possible."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet an even five-pound note," said Mr. Lupton at the Carlton,\r\n"that the present Ministry is out to-morrow, and another that no one\r\nnames five members of the next Cabinet."\r\n\r\n"You can help to win your first bet," said Mr. Beauchamp, a very\r\nold member, who, like many other Conservatives, had supported the\r\nCoalition.\r\n\r\n"I shall not do that," said Lupton, "though I think I ought. I won\'t\r\nvote against the man in his misfortunes, though, upon my soul, I\r\ndon\'t love him very dearly. I shall vote neither way, but I hope that\r\nSir Orlando may succeed."\r\n\r\n"If he do, who is to come in?" said the other. "I suppose you don\'t\r\nwant to serve under Sir Orlando?"\r\n\r\n"Nor certainly under the Duke of Omnium. We shall not want a Prime\r\nMinister as long as there are as good fish in the sea as have been\r\ncaught out of it."\r\n\r\nThere had lately been formed a new Liberal club, established on a\r\nbroader basis than the Progress, and perhaps with a greater amount of\r\naristocratic support. This had come up since the Duke had been Prime\r\nMinister. Certain busy men had never been quite contented with the\r\nexisting state of things, and had thought that the Liberal party,\r\nwith such assistance as such a club could give it, would be strong\r\nenough to rule alone. That the great Liberal party should be impeded\r\nin its work and its triumph by such men as Sir Orlando Drought and\r\nSir Timothy Beeswax was odious to the club. All the Pallisers had,\r\nfrom time immemorial, run straight as Liberals, and therefore the\r\nclub had been unwilling to oppose the Duke personally, though he was\r\nthe chief of the Coalition. And certain members of the Government,\r\nPhineas Finn, for instance, Barrington Erle, and Mr. Rattler were on\r\nthe committee of the club. But the club, as a club, was not averse\r\nto a discontinuance of the present state of things. Mr. Gresham\r\nmight again become Prime Minister, if he would condescend so far,\r\nor Mr. Monk. It might be possible that the great Liberal triumph\r\ncontemplated by the club might not be achieved by the present\r\nHouse;--but the present House must go shortly, and then, with\r\nthat assistance from a well-organised club, which had lately been\r\nso terribly wanting,--the lack of which had made the Coalition\r\nnecessary,--no doubt the British constituencies would do their duty,\r\nand a Liberal Prime Minister, pure and simple, might reign,--almost\r\nfor ever. With this great future before it, the club was very\r\nlukewarm in its support of the present Bill. "I shall go down and\r\nvote for them of course," said Mr. O\'Mahony, "just for the look of\r\nthe thing." In saying this Mr. O\'Mahony expressed the feeling of\r\nthe club, and the feeling of the Liberal party generally. There was\r\nsomething due to the Duke, but not enough to make it incumbent on his\r\nfriends to maintain him in his position as Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nIt was a great day for Sir Orlando. At half-past four the House was\r\nfull,--not from any desire to hear Sir Orlando\'s arguments against\r\nthe Bill, but because it was felt that a good deal of personal\r\ninterest would be attached to the debate. If one were asked in these\r\ndays what gift should a Prime Minister ask first from the fairies,\r\none would name the power of attracting personal friends. Eloquence,\r\nif it be too easy, may become almost a curse. Patriotism is\r\nsuspected, and sometimes sinks almost to pedantry. A Jove-born\r\nintellect is hardly wanted, and clashes with the inferiorities.\r\nIndustry is exacting. Honesty is unpractical. Truth is easily\r\noffended. Dignity will not bend. But the man who can be all things to\r\nall men, who has ever a kind word to speak, a pleasant joke to crack,\r\nwho can forgive all sins, who is ever prepared for friend or foe but\r\nnever very bitter to the latter, who forgets not men\'s names, and is\r\nalways ready with little words,--he is the man who will be supported\r\nat a crisis such as this that was now in the course of passing. It is\r\nfor him that men will struggle, and talk, and, if needs be, fight, as\r\nthough the very existence of the country depended on his political\r\nsecurity. The present man would receive no such defence;--but still\r\nthe violent deposition of a Prime Minister is always a memorable\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nSir Orlando made his speech, and, as had been anticipated, it had\r\nvery little to do with the Bill, and was almost exclusively an attack\r\nupon his late chief. He thought, he said, that this was an occasion\r\non which they had better come to a direct issue with as little delay\r\nas possible. If he rightly read the feeling of the House, no Bill of\r\nthis magnitude coming from the present Ministry would be likely to\r\nbe passed in an efficient condition. The Duke had frittered away his\r\nsupport in that House, and as a Minister had lost that confidence\r\nwhich a majority of the House had once been willing to place in him.\r\nWe need not follow Sir Orlando through his speech. He alluded to\r\nhis own services, and declared that he was obliged to withdraw them\r\nbecause the Duke would not trust him with the management of his\r\nown office. He had reason to believe that other gentlemen who had\r\nattached themselves to the Duke\'s Ministry had found themselves\r\nequally crippled by this passion for autocratic rule. Hereupon a loud\r\nchorus of disapprobation came from the Treasury bench, which was\r\nfully answered by opposing noises from the other side of the House.\r\nSir Orlando declared that he need only point to the fact that the\r\nMinistry had been already shivered by the secession of various\r\ngentlemen. "Only two," said a voice. Sir Orlando was turning round to\r\ncontradict the voice when he was greeted by another. "And those the\r\nweakest," said the other voice, which was indubitably that of Larry\r\nFitzgibbon. "I will not speak of myself," said Sir Orlando pompously;\r\n"but I am authorised to tell the House that the noble lord who is now\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies only holds his office till this\r\ncrisis shall have passed."\r\n\r\nAfter that there was some sparring of a very bitter kind between Sir\r\nTimothy and Phineas Finn, till at last it seemed that the debate was\r\nto degenerate into a war of man against man. Phineas, and Erle, and\r\nLaurence Fitzgibbon allowed themselves to be lashed into anger, and,\r\nas far as words went, had the best of it. But of what use could it\r\nbe? Every man there had come into the House prepared to vote for or\r\nagainst the Duke of Omnium,--or resolved, like Mr. Lupton, not to\r\nvote at all; and it was hardly on the cards that a single vote should\r\nbe turned this way or that by any violence of speaking. "Let it\r\npass," said Mr. Monk in a whisper to Phineas. "The fire is not worth\r\nthe fuel."\r\n\r\n"I know the Duke\'s faults," said Phineas; "but these men know nothing\r\nof his virtues, and when I hear them abuse him I cannot stand it."\r\n\r\nEarly in the night,--before twelve o\'clock,--the House divided, and\r\neven at the moment of the division no one quite knew how it would go.\r\nThere would be many who would of course vote against the amendment\r\nas being simply desirous of recording their opinion in favour of the\r\nBill generally. And there were some who thought that Sir Orlando and\r\nhis followers had been too forward, and too confident of their own\r\nstanding in the House, in trying so violent a mode of opposition. It\r\nwould have been better, these men thought, to have insured success\r\nby a gradual and persistent opposition to the Bill itself. But they\r\nhardly knew how thoroughly men may be alienated by silence and a cold\r\ndemeanour. Sir Orlando on the division was beaten, but was beaten\r\nonly by nine. "He can\'t go on with his Bill," said Rattler in one of\r\nthe lobbies of the House. "I defy him. The House wouldn\'t stand it,\r\nyou know." "No minister," said Roby, "could carry a measure like that\r\nwith a majority of nine on a vote of confidence!" The House was of\r\ncourse adjourned, and Mr. Monk went at once to Carlton Terrace.\r\n\r\n"I wish it had only been three or four," said the Duke, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because there would have been less doubt."\r\n\r\n"Is there any at present?"\r\n\r\n"Less possibility for doubt, I will say. You would not wish to make\r\nthe attempt with such a majority?"\r\n\r\n"I could not do it, Duke!"\r\n\r\n"I quite agree with you. But there will be those who will say that\r\nthe attempt might be made,--who will accuse us of being faint-hearted\r\nbecause we do not make it."\r\n\r\n"They will be men who understand nothing of the temper of the House."\r\n\r\n"Very likely. But still, I wish the majority had only been two or\r\nthree. There is little more to be said, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Very little, your Grace."\r\n\r\n"We had better meet to-morrow at two, and, if possible, I will see\r\nher Majesty in the afternoon. Good night, Mr. Monk."\r\n\r\n"Good night, Duke."\r\n\r\n"My reign is ended. You are a good deal an older man than I, and\r\nyet probably yours has yet to begin." Mr. Monk smiled and shook his\r\nhead as he left the room, not trusting himself to discuss so large a\r\nsubject at so late an hour of the night.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting a moment after his colleague\'s departure, the Prime\r\nMinister,--for he was still Prime Minister,--went into his wife\'s\r\nroom, knowing that she was waiting up till she should hear the result\r\nof the division, and there he found Mrs. Finn with her. "Is it over?"\r\nasked the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Yes;--there has been a division. Mr. Monk has just been with me."\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"We have beaten them, of course, as we always do," said the Duke,\r\nattempting to be pleasant. "You didn\'t suppose there was anything to\r\nfear? Your husband has always bid you keep up your courage;--has he\r\nnot, Mrs. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"My husband has lost his senses, I think," she said. "He has taken to\r\nsuch storming and raving about his political enemies that I hardly\r\ndare to open my mouth."\r\n\r\n"Tell me what has been done, Plantagenet," ejaculated the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you be as unreasonable as Mrs. Finn, Cora. The House has voted\r\nagainst Sir Orlando\'s amendment by a majority of nine."\r\n\r\n"Only nine!"\r\n\r\n"And I shall cease to be Prime Minister to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that it\'s settled?"\r\n\r\n"Quite settled. The play has been played, and the curtain has fallen,\r\nand the lights are being put out, and the poor weary actors may go\r\nhome to bed."\r\n\r\n"But on such an amendment surely any majority would have done."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear. I will not name a number, but nine certainly would not\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"And it is all over?"\r\n\r\n"My Ministry is all over, if you mean that."\r\n\r\n"Then everything is over for me. I shall settle down in the country\r\nand build cottages, and mix draughts. You, Marie, will still be\r\ngoing up the tree. If Mr. Finn manages well he may come to be Prime\r\nMinister some day."\r\n\r\n"He has hardly such ambition, Lady Glen."\r\n\r\n"The ambition will come fast enough;--will it not, Plantagenet? Let\r\nhim once begin to dream of it as possible, and the desire will soon\r\nbe strong enough. How should you feel if it were so?"\r\n\r\n"It is quite impossible," said Mrs. Finn, gravely.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why anything is impossible. Sir Orlando will be Prime\r\nMinister now, and Sir Timothy Beeswax Lord Chancellor. After that\r\nanybody may hope to be anything. Well,--I suppose we may go to bed.\r\nIs your carriage here, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"Ring the bell, Plantagenet, for somebody to see her down. Come to\r\nlunch to-morrow because I shall have so many groans to utter. What\r\nbeasts, what brutes, what ungrateful wretches men are!--worse than\r\nwomen when they get together in numbers enough to be bold. Why have\r\nthey deserted you? What have we not done for them? Think of all the\r\nnew bedroom furniture that we sent to Gatherum merely to keep the\r\nparty together. There were thousands of yards of linen, and it has\r\nall been of no use. Don\'t you feel like Wolsey, Plantagenet?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least, my dear. No one will take anything away from me\r\nthat is my own."\r\n\r\n"For me, I am almost as much divorced as Catherine, and have had my\r\nhead cut off as completely as Anne Bullen and the rest of them. Go\r\naway, Marie, because I am going to have a cry by myself."\r\n\r\nThe Duke himself on that night put Mrs. Finn into her carriage; and\r\nas he walked with her downstairs he asked her whether she believed\r\nthe Duchess to be in earnest in her sorrow. "She so mixes up her\r\nmirth and woe together," said the Duke, "that I myself sometimes can\r\nhardly understand her."\r\n\r\n"I think she does regret it, Duke."\r\n\r\n"She told me but the other day that she would be contented."\r\n\r\n"A few weeks will make her so. As for your Grace, I hope I may\r\ncongratulate you."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--I think so. We none of us like to be beaten when we have\r\ntaken a thing in hand. There is always a little disappointment at\r\nfirst. But, upon the whole, it is better as it is. I hope it will not\r\nmake your husband unhappy."\r\n\r\n"Not for his own sake. He will go again into the middle of the\r\nscramble and fight on one side or the other. For my own part I think\r\nopposition the pleasantest. Good night, Duke. I am so sorry that I\r\nshould have troubled you."\r\n\r\nThen he went alone to his own room, and sat there without moving for\r\na couple of hours. Surely it was a great thing to have been Prime\r\nMinister of England for three years,--a prize of which nothing now\r\ncould rob him. He ought not to be unhappy; and yet he knew himself\r\nto be wretched and disappointed. It had never occurred to him to be\r\nproud of being a duke, or to think of his wealth otherwise than a\r\nchance incident of his life, advantageous indeed, but by no means\r\na source of honour. And he had been aware that he had owed his\r\nfirst seat in Parliament to his birth, and probably also his first\r\nintroduction to official life. An heir to a dukedom, if he will only\r\nwork hard, may almost with certainty find himself received into one\r\nor the other regiment in Downing Street. It had not in his early days\r\nbeen with him as it had with his friends Mr. Monk and Phineas Finn,\r\nwho had worked their way from the very ranks. But even a duke cannot\r\nbecome Prime Minister by favour. Surely he had done something of\r\nwhich he might be proud. And so he tried to console himself.\r\n\r\nBut to have done something was nothing to him,--nothing to his\r\npersonal happiness,--unless there was also something left for him to\r\ndo. How should it be with him now,--how for the future? Would men\r\never listen to him again, or allow him again to work in their behoof,\r\nas he used to do in his happy days in the House of Commons? He feared\r\nthat it was all over for him, and that for the rest of his days he\r\nmust simply be the Duke of Omnium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV\r\n\r\n"I Am Disgraced and Shamed"\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the commencement of the Session Arthur Fletcher became a\r\nconstant visitor in Manchester Square, dining with the old barrister\r\nalmost constantly on Sundays, and not unfrequently on other days when\r\nthe House and his general engagements would permit it. Between him\r\nand Emily\'s father there was no secret and no misunderstanding. Mr.\r\nWharton quite understood that the young member of Parliament was\r\nearnestly purposed to marry his daughter, and Fletcher was sure of\r\nall the assistance and support which Mr. Wharton could give him. The\r\nname of Lopez was very rarely used between them. It had been tacitly\r\nagreed that there was no need that it should be mentioned. The man\r\nhad come like a destroying angel between them and their fondest\r\nhopes. Neither could ever be what he would have been had that man\r\nnever appeared to destroy their happiness. But the man had gone away,\r\nnot without a tragedy that was appalling;--and each thought that, as\r\nregarded him, he and the tragedy might be, if not forgotten at least\r\nput aside, if only that other person in whom they were interested\r\ncould be taught to seem to forget him. "It is not love," said the\r\nfather, "but a feeling of shame." Arthur Fletcher shook his head,\r\nnot quite agreeing with this. It was not that he feared that she\r\nloved the memory of her late husband. Such love was, he thought,\r\nimpossible. But there was, he believed, something more than the\r\nfeeling which her father described as shame. There was pride also;--a\r\ndetermination in her own bosom not to confess the fault she had made\r\nin giving herself to him whom she must now think to have been so much\r\nthe least worthy of her two suitors. "Her fortune will not be what I\r\nonce promised you," said the old man plaintively.\r\n\r\n"I do not remember that I ever asked you as to her fortune," Arthur\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. If you had I should not have told you. But as I\r\nnamed a sum, it is right that I should explain to you that that man\r\nsucceeded in lessening it by six or seven thousand pounds."\r\n\r\n"If that were all!"\r\n\r\n"And I have promised Sir Alured that Everett, as his heir, should\r\nhave the use of a considerable portion of his share without waiting\r\nfor my death. It is odd that the one of my children from whom I\r\ncertainly expected the greater trouble should have fallen so entirely\r\non his feet; and that the other--; well, let us hope for the best.\r\nEverett seems to have taken up with Wharton as though it belonged\r\nto him already. And Emily--! Well, my dear boy, let us hope that it\r\nmay come right yet. You are not drinking your wine. Yes,--pass the\r\nbottle; I\'ll have another glass before I go upstairs."\r\n\r\nIn this way the time went by till Emily returned to town. The\r\nMinistry had just then resigned, but I think that "this great\r\nreactionary success," as it was called by the writer in the "People\'s\r\nBanner," affected one member of the Lower House much less than the\r\nreturn to London of Mrs. Lopez. Arthur Fletcher had determined that\r\nhe would renew his suit as soon as a year should have expired since\r\nthe tragedy which had made his love a widow,--and that year had now\r\npassed away. He had known the day well,--as had she, when she passed\r\nthe morning weeping in her own room at Wharton. Now he questioned\r\nhimself whether a year would suffice,--whether both in mercy to her\r\nand with the view of realizing his own hopes he should give her some\r\nlonger time for recovery. But he had told himself that it should be\r\ndone at the end of a year, and as he had allowed no one to talk him\r\nout of his word, so neither would he be untrue to it himself. But\r\nit became with him a deep matter of business, a question of great\r\ndifficulty, how he should arrange the necessary interview,--whether\r\nhe should plead his case with her at their first meeting, or whether\r\nhe had better allow her to become accustomed to his presence in the\r\nhouse. His mother had attempted to ridicule him, because he was, as\r\nshe said, afraid of a woman. He well remembered that he had never\r\nbeen afraid of Emily Wharton when they had been quite young,--little\r\nmore than a boy and girl together. Then he had told her of his love\r\nover and over again, and had found almost a comfortable luxury in\r\nurging her to say a word, which she had never indeed said, but\r\nwhich probably in those days he still hoped that she would say. And\r\noccasionally he had feigned to be angry with her, and had tempted her\r\non to little quarrels with a boyish idea that quick reconciliation\r\nwould perhaps throw her into his arms. But now it seemed to him that\r\nan age had passed since those days. His love had certainly not faded.\r\nThere had never been a moment when that had been on the wing. But now\r\nthe azure plumage of his love had become grey as the wings of a dove,\r\nand the gorgeousness of his dreams had sobered into hopes and fears\r\nwhich were a constant burden to his heart. There was time enough,\r\nstill time enough for happiness if she would yield;--and time enough\r\nfor the dull pressure of unsatisfied aspirations should she persist\r\nin her refusal.\r\n\r\nAt last he saw her, almost by accident, and that meeting certainly\r\nwas not fit for the purpose of his suit. He called at Stone Buildings\r\nthe day after her arrival, and found her at her father\'s chambers.\r\nShe had come there keeping some appointment with him, and certainly\r\nhad not expected to meet her lover. He was confused and hardly able\r\nto say a word to account for his presence, but she greeted him with\r\nalmost sisterly affection, saying some word of Longbarns and his\r\nfamily, telling him how Everett, to Sir Alured\'s great delight, had\r\nbeen sworn in as a magistrate for the County, and how at the last\r\nhunt meeting John Fletcher had been asked to take the County hounds,\r\nbecause old Lord Weobly at seventy-five had declared himself to\r\nbe unable any longer to ride as a master of hounds ought to ride.\r\nAll these things Arthur had of course heard, such news being too\r\nimportant to be kept long from him; but on none of these subjects\r\nhad he much to say. He stuttered and stammered, and quickly went\r\naway;--not, however, before he had promised to come and dine as usual\r\non the next Sunday, and not without observing that the anniversary of\r\nthat fatal day of release had done something to lighten the sombre\r\nload of mourning which the widow had hitherto worn.\r\n\r\nYes;--he would dine there on the Sunday, but how would it be with him\r\nthen? Mr. Wharton never went out of the house on a Sunday evening,\r\nand could hardly be expected to leave his own drawing-room for the\r\nsake of giving a lover an opportunity. No;--he must wait till that\r\nevening should have passed, and then make the occasion for himself as\r\nbest he might. The Sunday came and the dinner was eaten, and after\r\ndinner there was the single bottle of port and the single bottle of\r\nclaret. "How do you think she is looking?" asked the father. "She was\r\nas pale as death before we got her down into the country."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, sir," said he, "I\'ve hardly looked at her. It is not a\r\nmatter of looks now, as it used to be. It has got beyond that. It is\r\nnot that I am indifferent to seeing a pretty face, or that I have no\r\nlonger an opinion of my own about a woman\'s figure. But there grows\r\nup, I think, a longing which almost kills that consideration."\r\n\r\n"To me she is as beautiful as ever," said the father proudly.\r\n\r\nFletcher did manage, when in the drawing-room, to talk for a while\r\nabout John and the hounds, and then went away, having resolved that\r\nhe would come again on the very next day. Surely she would not give\r\nan order that he should be denied admittance. She had been too calm,\r\ntoo even, too confident in herself for that. Yes;--he would come and\r\ntell her plainly what he had to say. He would tell it with all the\r\nsolemnity of which he was capable, with a few words, and those the\r\nstrongest which he could use. Should she refuse him,--as he almost\r\nknew that she would at first,--then he would tell her of her father\r\nand of the wishes of all their joint friends. "Nothing," he would say\r\nto her, "nothing but personal dislike can justify you in refusing\r\nto heal so many wounds." As he fixed on these words he failed to\r\nremember how little probable it is that a lover should ever be able\r\nto use the phrases he arranges.\r\n\r\nOn Monday he came, and asked for Mrs. Lopez, slurring over the word\r\nas best he could. The butler said his mistress was at home. Since the\r\ndeath of the man he had so thoroughly despised, the old servant had\r\nnever called her Mrs. Lopez. Arthur was shown upstairs, and found the\r\nlady he sought,--but he found Mrs. Roby also. It may be remembered\r\nthat Mrs. Roby, after the tragedy, had been refused admittance into\r\nMr. Wharton\'s house. Since that there had been some correspondence,\r\nand a feeling had prevailed that the woman was not to be quarrelled\r\nwith for ever. "I did not do it, papa, because of her," Emily had\r\nsaid with some scorn, and that scorn had procured Mrs. Roby\'s pardon.\r\nShe was now making a morning call, and suiting her conversation to\r\nthe black dress of her niece. Arthur was horrified at seeing her.\r\nMrs. Roby had always been to him odious, not only as a personal enemy\r\nbut as a vulgar woman. He, at any rate, attributed to her a great\r\npart of the evil that had been done, feeling sure that had there been\r\nno house round the corner, Emily Wharton would never have become Mrs.\r\nLopez. As it was he was forced to shake hands with her, and forced to\r\nlisten to the funereal tone in which Mrs. Roby asked him if he did\r\nnot think that Mrs. Lopez looked much improved by her sojourn in\r\nHerefordshire. He shrank at the sound, and then, in order that it\r\nmight not be repeated, took occasion to show that he was allowed to\r\ncall his early playmate by her Christian name. Mrs. Roby, thinking\r\nthat she ought to check him, remarked that Mrs. Lopez\'s return was\r\na great thing for Mr. Wharton. Thereupon Arthur Fletcher seized his\r\nhat off the ground, wished them both good-bye, and hurried out of\r\nthe room. "What a very odd manner he has taken up since he became a\r\nmember of Parliament," said Mrs. Roby.\r\n\r\nEmily was silent for a moment, and then with an effort,--with intense\r\npain,--she said a word or two which she thought had better be at once\r\nspoken. "He went because he does not like to hear that name."\r\n\r\n"Good gracious!"\r\n\r\n"And papa does not like it. Don\'t say a word about it, aunt; pray\r\ndon\'t;--but call me Emily."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to be ashamed of your name?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, aunt. If you think it wrong you must stay away;--but I\r\nwill not have papa wounded."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--if Mr. Wharton wishes it;--of course." That evening Mrs. Roby\r\ntold Dick Roby, her husband, what an old fool Mr. Wharton was.\r\n\r\nThe next day, quite early, Fletcher was again at the house and was\r\nagain admitted upstairs. The butler, no doubt, knew well enough why\r\nhe came, and also knew that the purport of his coming had at any rate\r\nthe sanction of Mr. Wharton. The room was empty when he was shown\r\ninto it, but she came to him very soon. "I went away yesterday rather\r\nabruptly," he said. "I hope you did not think me rude."\r\n\r\n"Oh no."\r\n\r\n"Your aunt was here, and I had something I wished to say but could\r\nnot say very well before her."\r\n\r\n"I knew that she had driven you away. You and Aunt Harriet were never\r\ngreat friends."\r\n\r\n"Never;--but I will forgive her everything. I will forgive all the\r\ninjuries that have been done me if you now will do as I ask you."\r\n\r\nOf course she knew what it was that he was about to ask. When he had\r\nleft her at Longbarns without saying a word of his love, without\r\ngiving her any hint whereby she might allow herself to think that\r\nhe intended to renew his suit, then she had wept because it was so.\r\nThough her resolution had been quite firm as to the duty which was\r\nincumbent on her of remaining in her desolate condition of almost\r\nnameless widowhood, yet she had been unable to refrain from bitter\r\ntears because he also had seemed to see that such was her duty. But\r\nnow again, knowing that the request was coming, feeling once more\r\nconfident of the constancy of his love, she was urgent with herself\r\nas to that heavy duty. She would be unwomanly, dead to all shame,\r\nalmost inhuman, were she to allow herself again to indulge in love\r\nafter all the havoc she had made. She had been little more than a\r\nbride when that husband, for whom she had so often been forced to\r\nblush, had been driven by the weight of his misfortunes and disgraces\r\nto destroy himself! By the marriage she had made she had overwhelmed\r\nher whole family with dishonour. She had done it with a persistency\r\nof perverse self-will which she herself could not now look back upon\r\nwithout wonder and horror. She, too, should have died as well as\r\nhe,--only that death had not been within the compass of her powers as\r\nof his. How then could she forget it all, and wipe it away from her\r\nmind, as she would figures from a slate with a wet towel? How could\r\nit be fit that she should again be a bride with such a spectre of a\r\nhusband haunting her memory? She had known that the request was to be\r\nmade when he had come so quickly, and had not doubted it for a moment\r\nwhen he took his sudden departure. She had known it well, when just\r\nnow the servant told her that Mr. Fletcher was in the drawing-room\r\nbelow. But she was quite certain of the answer she must make. "I\r\nshould be sorry you should ask me anything I cannot do," she said in\r\na very low voice.\r\n\r\n"I will ask you for nothing for which I have not your father\'s\r\nsanction."\r\n\r\n"The time has gone by, Arthur, in which I might well have been guided\r\nby my father. There comes a time when personal feelings must be\r\nstronger than a father\'s authority. Papa cannot see me with my own\r\neyes; he cannot understand what I feel. It is simply this,--that\r\nhe would have me to be other than I am. But I am what I have made\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"You have not heard me as yet. You will hear me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"I have loved you ever since I was a boy." He paused as though he\r\nexpected that she would make some answer to this; but of course there\r\nwas nothing that she could say. "I have been true to you since we\r\nwere together almost as children."\r\n\r\n"It is your nature to be true."\r\n\r\n"In this matter, at any rate, I shall never change. I never for\r\na moment had a doubt about my love. There never has been any one\r\nelse whom I have ventured to compare with you. Then came that great\r\ntrouble. Emily, you must let me speak freely this once, as so much,\r\nto me at least, depends on it."\r\n\r\n"Say what you will, Arthur. Do not wound me more than you can help."\r\n\r\n"God knows how willingly I would heal every wound without a word\r\nif it could be done. I don\'t know whether you ever thought what I\r\nsuffered when he came among us and robbed me,--well, I will not say\r\nrobbed me of your love, because it was not mine--but took away with\r\nhim that which I had been trying to win."\r\n\r\n"I did not think a man would feel it like that."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t a man feel as well as a woman? I had set my heart on\r\nhaving you for my wife. Can any desire be dearer to a man than that?\r\nThen he came. Well, dearest; surely I may say that he was not worthy\r\nof you."\r\n\r\n"We were neither of us worthy," she said.\r\n\r\n"I need not tell you that we all grieved. It seemed to us down in\r\nHerefordshire as though a black cloud had come upon us. We could not\r\nspeak of you, nor yet could we be altogether silent."\r\n\r\n"Of course you condemned me,--as an outcast."\r\n\r\n"Did I write to you as though you were an outcast? Did I treat you\r\nwhen I saw you as an outcast? When I come to you to-day, is that\r\nproof that I think you to be an outcast? I have never deceived you,\r\nEmily."\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Then you will believe me when I say that through it all not one word\r\nof reproach or contumely has ever passed my lips in regard to you.\r\nThat you should have given yourself to one whom I could not think to\r\nbe worthy of you was, of course, a great sorrow. Had he been a prince\r\nof men it would, of course, have been a sorrow to me. How it went\r\nwith you during your married life I will not ask."\r\n\r\n"I was unhappy. I would tell you everything if I could. I was very\r\nunhappy."\r\n\r\n"Then came--the end." She was now weeping, with her face buried in\r\nher handkerchief. "I would spare you if I knew how, but there are\r\nsome things which must be said."\r\n\r\n"No;--no. I will bear it all--from you."\r\n\r\n"Well! His success had not lessened my love. Though then I could have\r\nno hope,--though you were utterly removed from me,--all that could\r\nnot change me. There it was,--as though my arm or my leg had been\r\ntaken from me. It was bad to live without an arm or leg, but there\r\nwas no help. I went on with my life and tried not to look like a\r\nwhipped cur;--though John from time to time would tell me that I\r\nfailed. But now;--now that it has again all changed,--what would you\r\nhave me do now? It may be that after all my limb may be restored\r\nto me, that I may be again as other men are, whole, and sound, and\r\nhappy;--so happy! When it may possibly be within my reach am I not to\r\nlook for my happiness?" He paused, but she wept on without speaking a\r\nword. "There are those who will say that I should wait till all these\r\nsigns of woe have been laid aside. But why should I wait? There has\r\ncome a great blot upon your life, and is it not well that it should\r\nbe covered as quickly as possible?"\r\n\r\n"It can never be covered."\r\n\r\n"You mean that it can never be forgotten. No doubt there are\r\npassages in our life which we cannot forget, though we bury them\r\nin the deepest silence. All this can never be driven out of your\r\nmemory,--nor from mine. But it need not therefore blacken all our\r\nlives. In such a condition we should not be ruled by what the world\r\nthinks."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I care nothing for what the world thinks. I am below all\r\nthat. It is what I think: I myself,--of myself."\r\n\r\n"Will you think of no one else? Are any of your thoughts for me,--or\r\nfor your father?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes;--for my father."\r\n\r\n"I need hardly tell you what he wishes. You must know how you can\r\nbest give him back the comfort he has lost."\r\n\r\n"But, Arthur, even for him I cannot do everything."\r\n\r\n"There is one question to be asked," he said, rising from her feet\r\nand standing before her;--"but one; and what you do should depend\r\nentirely on the answer which you may be able truly to make to that."\r\n\r\nThis he said so solemnly that he startled her.\r\n\r\n"What question, Arthur?"\r\n\r\n"Do you love me?" To this question at the moment she could make no\r\nreply. "Of course I know that you did not love me when you married\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Love is not all of one kind."\r\n\r\n"You know what love I mean. You did not love me then. You could\r\nnot have loved me,--though, perhaps, I thought I had deserved your\r\nlove. But love will change, and memory will sometimes bring back old\r\nfancies when the world has been stern and hard. When we were very\r\nyoung I think you loved me. Do you remember seven years ago at\r\nLongbarns, when they parted us and sent me away, because--because we\r\nwere so young? They did not tell us then, but I think you knew. I\r\nknow that I knew, and went nigh to swear that I would drown myself.\r\nYou loved me then, Emily."\r\n\r\n"I was a child then."\r\n\r\n"Now you are not a child. Do you love me now,--to-day? If so, give me\r\nyour hand, and let the past be buried in silence. All this has come,\r\nand gone, and has nearly made us old. But there is life before us\r\nyet, and if you are to me as I am to you it is better that our lives\r\nshould be lived together." Then he stood before her with his hand\r\nstretched out.\r\n\r\n"I cannot do it," she said.\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot be other than the wretched thing I have made myself."\r\n\r\n"But do you love me?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot analyse my heart. Love you;--yes! I have always loved you.\r\nEverything about you is dear to me. I can triumph in your triumphs,\r\nrejoice at your joy, weep at your sorrows, be ever anxious that all\r\ngood things may come to you;--but, Arthur, I cannot be your wife."\r\n\r\n"Not though it would make us happy,--Fletchers and Whartons all\r\nalike?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think I have not thought it over? Do you think that I have\r\nforgotten your first letter? Knowing your heart, as I do know it,\r\ndo you imagine that I have spent a day, an hour, for months past,\r\nwithout asking myself what answer I should make to you if the sweet\r\nconstancy of your nature should bring you again to me? I have\r\ntrembled when I have heard your voice. My heart has beat at the sound\r\nof your footstep as though it would burst! Do you think I have never\r\ntold myself what I had thrown away? But it is gone, and it is not now\r\nwithin my reach."\r\n\r\n"It is; it is," he said, throwing himself on his knees, and twining\r\nhis arms round her.\r\n\r\n"No;--no;--no;--never. I am disgraced and shamed. I have lain among\r\nthe pots till I am foul and blackened. Take your arms away. They\r\nshall not be defiled," she said as she sprang to her feet. "You shall\r\nnot have the thing that he has left."\r\n\r\n"Emily,--it is the only thing in the world that I crave."\r\n\r\n"Be a man and conquer your love,--as I will. Get it under your feet\r\nand press it to death. Tell yourself that it is shameful and must be\r\nabandoned. That you, Arthur Fletcher, should marry the widow of that\r\nman,--the woman that he had thrust so far into the mire that she can\r\nnever again be clean;--you, the chosen one, the bright star among\r\nus all;--you, whose wife should be the fairest, the purest, the\r\ntenderest of us all, a flower that has yet been hardly breathed on!\r\nWhile I-- Arthur," she said, "I know my duty better than that. I will\r\nnot seek an escape from my punishment in that way,--nor will I allow\r\nyou to destroy yourself. You have my word as a woman that it shall\r\nnot be so. Now I do not mind your knowing whether I love you or no."\r\nHe stood silent before her, not able for the moment to go on with his\r\nprayer. "And now, go," she said. "God bless you, and give you some\r\nday a fair and happy wife. And, Arthur, do not come again to me. If\r\nyou will let it be so, I shall have a delight in seeing you;--but not\r\nif you come as you have come now. And, Arthur, spare me with papa. Do\r\nnot let him think that it is all my fault that I cannot do the thing\r\nwhich he wishes." Then she left the room before he could say another\r\nword to her.\r\n\r\nBut it was all her fault. No;--in that direction he could not spare\r\nher. It must be told to her father, though he doubted his own power\r\nof describing all that had been said. "Do not come again to me," she\r\nhad said. At the moment he had been left speechless; but if there was\r\none thing fixed in his mind, it was the determination to come again.\r\nHe was sure now, not only of love that might have sufficed,--but\r\nof hot, passionate love. She had told him that her heart had beat\r\nat his footsteps, and that she had trembled as she listened to his\r\nvoice;--and yet she expected that he would not come again! But there\r\nwas a violence of decision about the woman which made him dread that\r\nhe might still come in vain. She was so warped from herself by the\r\nconviction of her great mistake, so prone to take shame to herself\r\nfor her own error, so keenly alive to the degradation to which she\r\nhad been submitted, that it might yet be impossible to teach her\r\nthat, though her husband had been vile and she mistaken, yet she had\r\nnot been soiled by his baseness.\r\n\r\nHe went at once to the old barrister\'s chambers and told him the\r\nresult of the meeting. "She is still a fool," said the father, not\r\nunderstanding at second-hand the depths of his daughter\'s feeling.\r\n\r\n"No, sir,--not that. She feels herself degraded by his degradation.\r\nIf it be possible we must save her from that."\r\n\r\n"She did degrade herself."\r\n\r\n"Not as she means it. She is not degraded in my eyes."\r\n\r\n"Why should she not take the only means in her power of rescuing\r\nherself and rescuing us all from the evil that she did? She owes it\r\nto you, to me, and to her brother."\r\n\r\n"I would hardly wish her to come to me in payment of such a debt."\r\n\r\n"There is no room left," said Mr. Wharton angrily, "for soft\r\nsentimentality. Well;--she must take her bed as she makes it. It\r\nis very hard on me, I know. Considering what she used to be, it is\r\nmarvellous to me that she should have so little idea left of doing\r\nher duty to others."\r\n\r\nArthur Fletcher found that the barrister was at the moment too angry\r\nto hear reason, or to be made to understand anything of the feelings\r\nof mixed love and admiration with which he himself was animated at\r\nthe moment. He was obliged therefore to content himself with assuring\r\nthe father that he did not intend to give up the pursuit of his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV\r\n\r\nThe Great Wharton Alliance\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wharton got home on that day he said not a word to Emily as\r\nto Arthur Fletcher. He had resolved to take various courses,--first\r\nto tell her roundly that she was neglecting her duty to herself and\r\nto her family, and that he would no longer take her part and be\r\nher good friend unless she would consent to marry the man whom she\r\nhad confessed that she loved. But as he thought of this he became\r\naware,--first that he could not carry out such a threat, and then\r\nthat he would lack even the firmness to make it. There was something\r\nin her face, something even in her dress, something in her whole\r\nmanner to himself, which softened him and reduced him to vassalage\r\ndirectly he saw her. Then he determined to throw himself on her\r\ncompassion and to implore her to put an end to all this misery by\r\nmaking herself happy. But as he drew near home he found himself\r\nunable to do even this. How is a father to beseech his widowed\r\ndaughter to give herself away in a second marriage? And therefore\r\nwhen he entered the house and found her waiting for him, he said\r\nnothing. At first she looked at him wistfully,--anxious to learn by\r\nhis face whether her lover had been with him. But when he spoke not a\r\nword, simply kissing her in his usual quiet way, she became cheerful\r\nin manner and communicative. "Papa," she said, "I have had a letter\r\nfrom Mary."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Just a nice chatty letter,--full of Everett, of course."\r\n\r\n"Everett is a great man now."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that you are very glad that he is what he is. Will you see\r\nMary\'s letter?" Mr. Wharton was not specially given to reading young\r\nladies\' correspondence, and did not know why this particular letter\r\nshould be offered to him. "You don\'t suspect anything at Wharton, do\r\nyou?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Suspect anything! No; I don\'t suspect anything." But now, having had\r\nhis curiosity aroused, he took the letter which was offered to him\r\nand read it. The letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Wharton, Thursday.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST EMILY,--\r\n\r\n   We all hope that you had a pleasant journey up to London,\r\n   and that Mr. Wharton is quite well. Your brother Everett\r\n   came over to Longbarns the day after you started and drove\r\n   me back to Wharton in the dog-cart. It was such a pleasant\r\n   journey, though, now I remember, it rained all the way.\r\n   But Everett has always so much to say that I didn\'t mind\r\n   the rain. I think it will end in John taking the hounds.\r\n   He says he won\'t, because he does not wish to be the slave\r\n   of the whole county;--but he says it in that sort of way\r\n   that we all think he means to do it. Everett tells him\r\n   that he ought, because he is the only hunting man on this\r\n   side of the county who can afford to do it without feeling\r\n   it much; and of course what Everett says will go a long\r\n   way with him. Sarah [Sarah was John Fletcher\'s wife] is\r\n   rather against it. But if he makes up his mind she\'ll be\r\n   sure to turn round. Of course it makes us all very anxious\r\n   at present to know how it is to end, for the Master of the\r\n   Hounds always is the leading man in our part of the world.\r\n   Papa went to the bench at Ross yesterday and took Everett\r\n   with him. It was the first time that Everett had sat\r\n   there. He says I am to tell his father he has not hung\r\n   anybody as yet.\r\n\r\n   They have already begun to cut down, or what they call\r\n   stubb up, Barnton Spinnies. Everett said that it is no\r\n   good keeping it as a wood, and papa agreed. So it is to go\r\n   into the home farm, and Griffiths is to pay rent for it. I\r\n   don\'t like having it cut down as the boys always used to\r\n   get nuts there, but Everett says it won\'t do to keep woods\r\n   for little boys to get nuts.\r\n\r\n   Mary Stocking has been very ill since you went, and I\'m\r\n   afraid she won\'t last long. When they get to be so very\r\n   bad with rheumatism I almost think it\'s wrong to pray for\r\n   them, because they are in so much pain. We thought at one\r\n   time that mamma\'s ointment had done her good, but when we\r\n   came to inquire, we found she had swallowed it. Wasn\'t it\r\n   dreadful? But it didn\'t seem to do her any harm. Everett\r\n   says that it wouldn\'t make any difference which she did.\r\n\r\n   Papa is beginning to be afraid that Everett is a\r\n   Radical. But I\'m sure he\'s not. He says he is as good a\r\n   Conservative as there is in all Herefordshire, only that\r\n   he likes to know what is to be conserved. Papa said after\r\n   dinner yesterday that everything English ought to be\r\n   maintained. Everett said that according to that we should\r\n   have kept the Star Chamber. "Of course I would," said\r\n   papa. Then they went at it, hammer and tongs. Everett had\r\n   the best of it. At any rate he talked the longest. But I\r\n   do hope he is not a Radical. No country gentleman ought to\r\n   be a Radical. Ought he, dear?\r\n\r\n   Mrs. Fletcher says you are to get the lozenges at Squire\'s\r\n   in Oxford Street, and be sure to ask for the Vade mecum\r\n   lozenges. She is all in a flutter about the hounds. She\r\n   says she hopes John will do nothing of the kind because of\r\n   the expense; but we all know that she would like him to\r\n   have them. The subscription is not very good, only L1500,\r\n   and it would cost him ever so much a year. But everybody\r\n   says that he is very rich and that he ought to do it. If\r\n   you see Arthur give him our love. Of course a member of\r\n   Parliament is too busy to write letters. But I don\'t think\r\n   Arthur ever was good at writing. Everett says that men\r\n   never ought to write letters. Give my love to Mr. Wharton.\r\n\r\n   I am, dearest Emily,\r\n   Your most affectionate Cousin,\r\n\r\n   MARY WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Everett is a fool," said Mr. Wharton as soon as he had read the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n"Why is he a fool, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Because he will quarrel with Sir Alured about politics before he\r\nknows where he is. What business has a young fellow like that to have\r\nan opinion either one side or the other, before his betters?"\r\n\r\n"But Everett always had strong opinions."\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t matter as long as he only talked nonsense at a club in\r\nLondon, but now he\'ll break that old man\'s heart."\r\n\r\n"But, papa, don\'t you see anything else?"\r\n\r\n"I see that John Fletcher is going to make an ass of himself and\r\nspend a thousand a year in keeping up a pack of hounds for other\r\npeople to ride after."\r\n\r\n"I think I see something else besides that."\r\n\r\n"What do you see?"\r\n\r\n"Would it annoy you if Everett were to become engaged to Mary?"\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Wharton whistled. "To be sure she does put his name into\r\nevery line of her letter. No; it wouldn\'t annoy me. I don\'t see why\r\nhe shouldn\'t marry his second cousin if he likes. Only if he is\r\nengaged to her, I think it odd that he shouldn\'t write and tell us."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he\'s not engaged to her yet. She wouldn\'t write at all in\r\nthat way if they were engaged. Everybody would be told at once, and\r\nSir Alured would never be able to keep it a secret. Why should there\r\nbe a secret? But I\'m sure she is very fond of him. Mary would never\r\nwrite about any man in that way unless she were beginning to be\r\nattached to him."\r\n\r\nAbout ten days after this there came two letters from Wharton Hall to\r\nManchester Square, the shortest of which shall be given first. It ran\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR FATHER,--\r\n\r\n   I have proposed to my cousin Mary, and she has accepted\r\n   me. Everybody here seems to like the idea. I hope it will\r\n   not displease you. Of course you and Emily will come down.\r\n   I will tell you when the day is fixed.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate son,\r\n\r\n   EVERETT WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis the old man read as he sat at breakfast with his daughter\r\nopposite to him, while Emily was reading a very much longer letter\r\nfrom the same house. "So it\'s going to be just as you guessed," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I was quite sure of it, papa. Is that from Everett? Is he very\r\nhappy?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I can\'t say whether he\'s happy or not. If he had got a\r\nnew horse he would have written at much greater length about it. It\r\nseems, however, to be quite fixed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. This is from Mary. She is happy at any rate. I suppose men\r\nnever say so much about these things as women."\r\n\r\n"May I see Mary\'s letter?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it would be quite fair, papa. It\'s only a girl\'s\r\nrhapsody about the man she loves,--very nice and womanly, but not\r\nintended for any one but me. It does not seem that they mean to wait\r\nvery long."\r\n\r\n"Why should they wait? Is any day fixed?"\r\n\r\n"Mary says that Everett talks about the middle of May. Of course you\r\nwill go down."\r\n\r\n"We must both go."\r\n\r\n"You will at any rate. Don\'t promise for me just at present. It must\r\nmake Sir Alured very happy. It is almost the same as finding himself\r\nat last with a son of his own. I suppose they will live at Wharton\r\naltogether now,--unless Everett gets into Parliament."\r\n\r\nBut the reader may see the young lady\'s letter, though her future\r\nfather-in-law was not permitted to do so, and will perceive that\r\nthere was a paragraph at the close of it which perhaps was more\r\nconducive to Emily\'s secrecy than her feelings as to the sacred\r\nobligations of female correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Monday, Wharton.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST EMILY,--\r\n\r\n   I wonder whether you will be much surprised at the news\r\n   I have to tell you. You cannot be more so than I am at\r\n   having to write it. It has all been so very sudden that\r\n   I almost feel ashamed of myself. Everett has proposed\r\n   to me, and I have accepted him. There;--now you know it\r\n   all. Though you never can know how very dearly I love him\r\n   and how thoroughly I admire him. I do think that he is\r\n   everything that a man ought to be, and that I am the most\r\n   fortunate young woman in the world. Only isn\'t it odd\r\n   that I should always have to live all my life in the same\r\n   house, and never change my name,--just like a man, or an\r\n   old maid? But I don\'t mind that because I do love him so\r\n   dearly and because he is so good. I hope he will write\r\n   to you and tell you that he likes me. He has written to\r\n   Mr. Wharton, I know. I was sitting by him and his letter\r\n   didn\'t take him a minute. But he says that long letters\r\n   about such things only give trouble. I hope you won\'t\r\n   think my letter troublesome. He is not sitting by me now\r\n   but has gone over to Longbarns to help to settle about\r\n   the hounds. John is going to have them after all. I wish\r\n   it hadn\'t happened just at this time because all the\r\n   gentlemen do think so much about it. Of course Everett is\r\n   one of the committee.\r\n\r\n   Papa and mamma are both very, very glad of it. Of course\r\n   it is nice for them as it will keep Everett and me here.\r\n   If I had married anybody else,--though I am sure I never\r\n   should,--she would have been very lonely. And of course\r\n   papa likes to think that Everett is already one of us.\r\n   I hope they never will quarrel about politics; but, as\r\n   Everett says, the world does change as it goes on, and\r\n   young men and old men never will think quite the same\r\n   about things. Everett told papa the other day that if he\r\n   could be put back a century he would be a Radical. Then\r\n   there were ever so many words. But Everett always laughs,\r\n   and at last papa comes round.\r\n\r\n   I can\'t tell you, my dear, what a fuss we are in already\r\n   about it all. Everett wants to have our marriage early in\r\n   May, so that we may have two months in Switzerland before\r\n   London is what he calls turned loose. And papa says that\r\n   there is no use in delaying, because he gets older every\r\n   day. Of course that is true of everybody. So that we are\r\n   all in a flutter about getting things. Mamma did talk of\r\n   going up to town, but I believe they have things now quite\r\n   as good at Hereford. Sarah, when she was married, had all\r\n   her things from London, but they say that there has been a\r\n   great change since that. I am sure that I think that you\r\n   may get anything you want at Muddocks and Cramble\'s. But\r\n   mamma says I am to have my veil from Howell and James\'s.\r\n\r\n   Of course you and Mr. Wharton will come. I shan\'t think it\r\n   any marriage without. Papa and mamma talk of it as quite\r\n   of course. You know how fond papa is of the bishop. I\r\n   think he will marry us. I own I should like to be married\r\n   by a bishop. It would make it so sweet and so solemn. Mr.\r\n   Higgenbottom could of course assist;--but he is such an\r\n   odd old man, with his snuff and his spectacles always\r\n   tumbling off, that I shouldn\'t like to have no one else. I\r\n   have often thought that if it were only for marrying\r\n   people we ought to have a nicer rector at Wharton.\r\n\r\n   Almost all the tenants have been to wish me joy. They are\r\n   very fond of Everett already, and now they feel that there\r\n   will never be any very great change. I do think it is the\r\n   very best thing that could be done, even if it were not\r\n   that I am so thoroughly in love with him. I didn\'t think I\r\n   should ever be able to own that I was in love with a man;\r\n   but now I feel quite proud of it. I don\'t mind telling you\r\n   because he is your brother, and I think that you will be\r\n   glad of it.\r\n\r\n   He talks very often about you. Of course you know what\r\n   it is that we all wish. I love Arthur Fletcher almost\r\n   as much as if he were my brother. He is my sister\'s\r\n   brother-in-law, and if he could become my husband\'s\r\n   brother-in-law too, I should be so happy. Of course we all\r\n   know that he wishes it. Write immediately to wish me joy.\r\n   Perhaps you could go to Howell and James\'s about the veil.\r\n   And promise to come to us in May. Sarah says the veil\r\n   ought to cost about thirty pounds.\r\n\r\n   Dearest, dearest Emily,\r\n   I shall so soon be your most affectionate sister,\r\n\r\n   MARY WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily\'s answer was full of warm, affectionate congratulations. She\r\nhad much to say in favour of Everett. She promised to use all her\r\nlittle skill at Howell and James\'s. She expressed a hope that the\r\novertures to be made in regard to the bishop might be successful. And\r\nshe made kind remarks even as to Muddocks and Cramble. But she would\r\nnot promise that she herself would be at Wharton on the happy day.\r\n"Dear Mary," she said, "remember what I have suffered, and that\r\nI cannot be quite as other people are. I could not stand at your\r\nmarriage in black clothes,--nor should I have the courage even if I\r\nhad the will to dress myself in others." None of the Whartons had\r\ncome to her wedding. There was no feeling of anger now left as to\r\nthat. She was quite aware that they had done right to stay away. But\r\nthe very fact that it had been right that they should stay away would\r\nmake it wrong that the widow of Ferdinand Lopez should now assist at\r\nthe marriage of one Wharton to another. This was all that a marriage\r\nought to be; whereas that had been--all that a marriage ought not to\r\nbe. In answer to the paragraph about Arthur Fletcher Emily Lopez had\r\nnot a word to say.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, early in April, Everett came up to town. Though his\r\nbride might be content to get her bridal clothes in Hereford, none\r\nbut a London tailor could decorate him properly for such an occasion.\r\nDuring these last weeks Arthur Fletcher had not been seen in\r\nManchester Square; nor had his name been mentioned there by Mr.\r\nWharton. Of anything that may have passed between them Emily was\r\naltogether ignorant. She observed, or thought that she observed, that\r\nher father was more silent with her,--perhaps less tender than he had\r\nbeen since the day on which her husband had perished. His manner of\r\nlife was the same. He almost always dined at home in order that she\r\nmight not be alone, and made no complaint as to her conduct. But she\r\ncould see that he was unhappy, and she knew the cause of his grief.\r\n"I think, papa," she said one day, "that it would be better that I\r\nshould go away." This was on the day before Everett\'s arrival,--of\r\nwhich, however, he had given no notice.\r\n\r\n"Go away! Where would you go to?"\r\n\r\n"It does not matter. I do not make you happy."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? Who says that I am not happy? Why do you talk like\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"Do not be angry with me. Nobody says so. I can see it well enough. I\r\nknow how good you are to me, but I am making your life wretched. I am\r\na wet blanket to you, and yet I cannot help myself. If I could only\r\ngo somewhere, where I could be of use."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean. This is your proper home."\r\n\r\n"No;--it is not my home. I ought to have forfeited it. I ought to go\r\nwhere I could work and be of some use in the world."\r\n\r\n"You might be of use if you chose, my dear. Your proper career is\r\nbefore you if you would condescend to accept it. It is not for me\r\nto persuade you, but I can see and feel the truth. Till you bring\r\nyourself to do that, your days will be blighted,--and so will mine.\r\nYou have made one great mistake in life. Stop a moment. I do not\r\nspeak often, but I wish you to listen to me now. Such mistakes do\r\ngenerally produce misery and ruin to all who are concerned. With you\r\nit chances that it may be otherwise. You can put your foot again upon\r\nthe firm ground and recover everything. Of course there must be a\r\nstruggle. One person has to struggle with circumstances, another\r\nwith his foes, and a third with his own feelings. I can understand\r\nthat there should be such a struggle with you; but it ought to be\r\nmade. You ought to be brave enough and strong enough to conquer your\r\nregrets, and to begin again. In no other way can you do anything\r\nfor me or for yourself. To talk of going away is childish nonsense.\r\nWhither would you go? I shall not urge you any more, but I would not\r\nhave you talk to me in that way." Then he got up and left the room\r\nand the house, and went down to his club,--in order that she might\r\nthink of what he had said in solitude.\r\n\r\nAnd she did think of it;--but still continually with an assurance to\r\nherself that her father did not understand her feelings. The career\r\nof which he spoke was no doubt open to her, but she could not regard\r\nit as that which it was proper that she should fulfil, as he did.\r\nWhen she told her lover that she had lain among the pots till she\r\nwas black and defiled, she expressed in the strongest language that\r\nwhich was her real conviction. He did not think her to have been\r\ndefiled,--or at any rate thought that she might again bear the wings\r\nof a dove; but she felt it, and therefore knew herself to be unfit.\r\nShe had said it all to her lover in the strongest words she could\r\nfind, but she could not repeat them to her father. The next morning\r\nwhen he came into the parlour where she was already sitting, she\r\nlooked up at him almost reproachfully. Did he think that a woman was\r\na piece of furniture which you can mend, and revarnish, and fit out\r\nwith new ornaments, and then send out for use, second-hand indeed,\r\nbut for all purposes as good as new?\r\n\r\nThen, while she was in this frame of mind, Everett came in upon her\r\nunawares, and with his almost boisterous happiness succeeded for a\r\nwhile in changing the current of her thoughts. He was of course now\r\nuppermost in his own thoughts. The last few months had made so much\r\nof him that he might be excused for being unable to sink himself in\r\nthe presence of others. He was the heir to the baronetcy,--and to the\r\ndouble fortunes of the two old men. And he was going to be married in\r\na manner as every one told him to increase the glory and stability of\r\nthe family. "It\'s all nonsense about your not coming down," he said.\r\nShe smiled and shook her head. "I can only tell you that it will give\r\nthe greatest offence to every one. If you knew how much they talk\r\nabout you down there I don\'t think you would like to hurt them."\r\n\r\n"Of course I would not like to hurt them."\r\n\r\n"And considering that you have no other brother--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Everett!"\r\n\r\n"I think more about it, perhaps, than you do. I think you owe it me\r\nto come down. You will never probably have another chance of being\r\npresent at your brother\'s marriage." This he said in a tone that was\r\nalmost lachrymose.\r\n\r\n"A wedding, Everett, should be merry."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that. It is a very serious sort of thing to my\r\nway of thinking. When Mary got your letter it nearly broke her heart.\r\nI think I have a right to expect it, and if you don\'t come I shall\r\nfeel myself injured. I don\'t see what is the use of having a family\r\nif the members of it do not stick together. What would you think if I\r\nwere to desert you?"\r\n\r\n"Desert you, Everett?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes;--it is something of the kind. I have made my request, and\r\nyou can comply with it or not as you please."\r\n\r\n"I will go," she said very slowly. Then she left him and went to her\r\nown room to think in what description of garment she could appear at\r\na wedding with the least violence to the conditions of her life.\r\n\r\n"I have got her to say she\'ll come," he said to his father that\r\nevening. "If you leave her to me, I\'ll bring her round."\r\n\r\nSoon after that,--within a day or two,--there came out a paragraph in\r\none of the fashionable newspapers of the day, saying that an alliance\r\nhad been arranged between the heir to the Wharton title and property\r\nand the daughter of the present baronet. I think that this had\r\nprobably originated in the club gossip. I trust it did not spring\r\ndirectly from the activity or ambition of Everett himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI\r\n\r\nWho Will It Be?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first day or two after the resignation of the Ministry\r\nthe Duchess appeared to take no further notice of the matter. An\r\nungrateful world had repudiated her and her husband, and he had\r\nfoolishly assisted and given way to the repudiation. All her grand\r\naspirations were at an end. All her triumphs were over. And worse\r\nthan that, there was present to her a conviction that she never had\r\nreally triumphed. There never had come the happy moment in which she\r\nhad felt herself to be dominant over other women. She had toiled and\r\nstruggled, she had battled and occasionally submitted; and yet there\r\nwas present to her a feeling that she had stood higher in public\r\nestimation as Lady Glencora Palliser,--whose position had been all\r\nher own and had not depended on her husband,--than now she had done\r\nas Duchess of Omnium, and wife of the Prime Minister of England. She\r\nhad meant to be something, she knew not what, greater than had been\r\nthe wives of other Prime Ministers and other Dukes; and now she\r\nfelt that in her failure she had been almost ridiculous. And the\r\nfailure, she thought, had been his,--or hers,--rather than that of\r\ncircumstances. If he had been less scrupulous and more persistent\r\nit might have been different,--or if she had been more discreet.\r\nSometimes she felt her own failing so violently as to acquit him\r\nalmost entirely. At other times she was almost beside herself with\r\nanger because all her losses seemed to have arisen from want of\r\nstubbornness on his part. When he had told her that he and his\r\nfollowers had determined to resign because they had beaten their foes\r\nby a majority only of nine, she took it into her head that he was in\r\nfault. Why should he go while his supporters were more numerous than\r\nhis opponents? It was useless to bid him think it over again. Though\r\nshe was far from understanding all the circumstances of the game,\r\nshe did know that he could not remain after having arranged with\r\nhis colleagues that he would go. So she became cross and sullen;\r\nand while he was going to Windsor and back and setting his house\r\nin order, and preparing the way for his successor,--whoever that\r\nsuccessor might be,--she was moody and silent, dreaming over some\r\nimpossible condition of things in accordance with which he might have\r\nremained Prime Minister--almost for ever.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday after the fatal division,--the division which the\r\nDuchess would not allow to have been fatal,--she came across him\r\nsomewhere in the house. She had hardly spoken to him since he had\r\ncome into her room that night and told her that all was over. She had\r\nsaid that she was unwell and had kept out of sight; and he had been\r\nhere and there, between Windsor and the Treasury Chambers, and had\r\nbeen glad to escape from her ill-humour. But she could not endure\r\nany longer the annoyance of having to get all her news through Mrs.\r\nFinn,--second hand, or third hand, and now found herself driven to\r\ncapitulate. "Well," she said; "how is it all going to be? I suppose\r\nyou do not know or you would have told me?"\r\n\r\n"There is very little to tell."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Monk is to be Prime Minister?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I did not say so. But it is not impossible."\r\n\r\n"Has the Queen sent for him?"\r\n\r\n"Not as yet. Her Majesty has seen both Mr. Gresham and Mr. Daubeny as\r\nwell as myself. It does not seem a very easy thing to make a Ministry\r\njust at present."\r\n\r\n"Why should not you go back?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think that is on the cards."\r\n\r\n"Why not? Ever so many men have done it, after going out,--and why\r\nnot you? I remember Mr. Mildmay doing it twice. It is always the\r\nthing when the man who has been sent for makes a mess of it, for the\r\nold minister to have another chance."\r\n\r\n"But what if the old minister will not take the chance?"\r\n\r\n"Then it is the old minister\'s fault. Why shouldn\'t you take the\r\nchance as well as another? It isn\'t many days ago since you were\r\nquite anxious to remain in. I thought you were going to break your\r\nheart because people even talked of your going."\r\n\r\n"I was going to break my heart, as you call it," he said, smiling,\r\n"not because people talked of my ceasing to be minister, but because\r\nthe feeling of the House of Commons justified people in so saying. I\r\nhope you see the difference."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. And there is no difference. The people we are talking\r\nabout are the members,--and they have supported you. You could go on\r\nif you chose. I\'m sure Mr. Monk wouldn\'t leave you."\r\n\r\n"It is just what Mr. Monk would do, and ought to do. No one is less\r\nlikely than Mr. Monk to behave badly in such an emergency. The more I\r\nsee of Mr. Monk, the higher I think of him."\r\n\r\n"He has his own game to play as well as others."\r\n\r\n"I think he has no game to play but that of his country. It is no use\r\nour discussing it, Cora."\r\n\r\n"Of course I understand nothing, because I\'m a woman."\r\n\r\n"You understand a great deal,--but not quite all. You may at any rate\r\nunderstand this,--that our troubles are at an end. You were saying\r\nbut the other day that the labours of being a Prime Minister\'s wife\r\nhad been almost too many for you."\r\n\r\n"I never said so. As long as you didn\'t give way no labour was\r\ntoo much for me. I would have done anything,--slaved morning and\r\nnight,--so that we might have succeeded. I hate being beat. I\'d\r\nsooner be cut in pieces."\r\n\r\n"There is no help for it now, Cora. The Lord Mayor, you know, is only\r\nLord Mayor for one year, and must then go back to private life."\r\n\r\n"But men have been Prime Ministers for ten years at a time. If you\r\nhave made up your mind, I suppose we may as well give up. I shall\r\nalways think it your own fault." He still smiled. "I shall," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cora!"\r\n\r\n"I can only speak as I feel."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you would speak as you do, if you knew how much your\r\nwords hurt me. In such a matter as this I should not be justified in\r\nallowing your opinions to have weight with me. But your sympathy\r\nwould be so much to me!"\r\n\r\n"When I thought it was making you ill, I wished that you might be\r\nspared."\r\n\r\n"My illness would be nothing, but my honour is everything. I, too,\r\nhave something to bear as well as you, and if you cannot approve of\r\nwhat I do, at any rate be silent."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I can be silent." Then he slowly left her. As he went she was\r\nalmost tempted to yield, and to throw herself into his arms, and to\r\npromise that she would be soft to him, and to say that she was sure\r\nthat all he did was for the best. But she could not bring herself as\r\nyet to be good-humoured. If he had only been a little stronger, a\r\nlittle thicker-skinned, made of clay a little coarser, a little other\r\nthan he was, it might all have been so different!\r\n\r\nEarly on that Sunday afternoon she had herself driven to Mrs. Finn\'s\r\nhouse in Park Lane, instead of waiting for her friend. Latterly she\r\nhad but seldom done this, finding that her presence at home was much\r\nwanted. She had been filled with, perhaps, foolish ideas of the\r\nnecessity of doing something,--of adding something to the strength of\r\nher husband\'s position,--and had certainly been diligent in her work.\r\nBut now she might run about like any other woman. "This is an honour,\r\nDuchess," said Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be sarcastic, Marie. We have nothing further to do with the\r\nbestowal of honours. Why didn\'t he make everybody a peer or a baronet\r\nwhile he was about it? Lord Finn! I don\'t see why he shouldn\'t have\r\nbeen Lord Finn. I\'m sure he deserved it for the way in which he\r\nattacked Sir Timothy Beeswax."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he\'d like it."\r\n\r\n"They all say so, but I suppose they do like it, or they wouldn\'t\r\ntake it. And I\'d have made Locock a knight;--Sir James Locock. He\'d\r\nmake a more knightly knight than Sir Timothy. When a man has power\r\nhe ought to use it. It makes people respect him. Mr. Daubeny made a\r\nduke, and people think more of that than anything he did. Is Mr. Finn\r\ngoing to join the new ministry?"\r\n\r\n"If you can tell me, Duchess, who is to be the new minister, I can\r\ngive a guess."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Monk."\r\n\r\n"Then he certainly will."\r\n\r\n"Or Mr. Daubeny."\r\n\r\n"Then he certainly won\'t."\r\n\r\n"Or Mr. Gresham."\r\n\r\n"That I could not answer."\r\n\r\n"Or the Duke of Omnium."\r\n\r\n"That would depend upon his Grace, If the Duke came back, Mr. Finn\'s\r\nservices would be at his disposal, whether in or out of office."\r\n\r\n"Very prettily said, my dear. I never look round this room without\r\nthinking of the first time I came here. Do you remember, when I found\r\nthe old man sitting there?" The old man alluded to was the late Duke.\r\n\r\n"I am not likely to forget it, Duchess."\r\n\r\n"How I hated you when I saw you! What a fright I thought you were! I\r\npictured you to myself as a sort of ogre, willing to eat up everybody\r\nfor the gratification of your own vanity."\r\n\r\n"I was very vain, but there was a little pride with it."\r\n\r\n"And now it has come to pass that I can\'t very well live without you.\r\nHow he did love you!"\r\n\r\n"His Grace was very good to me."\r\n\r\n"It would have done no great harm, after all, if he had made you\r\nDuchess of Omnium."\r\n\r\n"Very great harm to me, Lady Glen. As it is I got a friend that I\r\nloved dearly, and a husband that I love dearly too. In the other case\r\nI should have had neither. Perhaps I may say, that in that other\r\ncase my life would not have been brightened by the affection of the\r\npresent Duchess."\r\n\r\n"One can\'t tell how it would have gone, but I well remember the\r\nstate I was in then." The door was opened and Phineas Finn entered\r\nthe room. "What, Mr. Finn, are you at home? I thought everybody\r\nwas crowding down at the clubs, to know who is to be what. We are\r\nsettled. We are quiet. We have nothing to do to disturb ourselves.\r\nBut you ought to be in all the flutter of renewed expectation."\r\n\r\n"I am waiting my destiny in calm seclusion. I hope the Duke is well?"\r\n\r\n"As well as can be expected. He doesn\'t walk about his room with a\r\nponiard in his hand,--ready for himself or Sir Orlando; nor is he\r\nsitting crowned like Bacchus, drinking the health of the new Ministry\r\nwith Lord Drummond and Sir Timothy. He is probably sipping a cup of\r\ncoffee over a blue-book in dignified retirement. You should go and\r\nsee him."\r\n\r\n"I should be unwilling to trouble him when he is so much occupied."\r\n\r\n"That is just what has done him all the harm in the world. Everybody\r\npresumes that he has so much to think of that nobody goes near him.\r\nThen he is left to boody over everything by himself till he becomes\r\na sort of political hermit, or ministerial Lama, whom human eyes are\r\nnot to look upon. It doesn\'t matter now; does it?" Visitor after\r\nvisitor came in, and the Duchess chatted to them all, leaving the\r\nimpression on everybody that heard her that she at least was not\r\nsorry to be relieved from the troubles attending her husband\'s late\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nShe sat there over an hour, and as she was taking her leave she had a\r\nfew words to whisper to Mrs. Finn. "When this is all over," she said,\r\n"I mean to call on that Mrs. Lopez."\r\n\r\n"I thought you did go there."\r\n\r\n"That was soon after the poor man had killed himself,--when she was\r\ngoing away. Of course I only left a card. But I shall see her now if\r\nI can. We want to get her out of her melancholy if possible. I have a\r\nsort of feeling, you know, that among us we made the train run over\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that."\r\n\r\n"He got so horribly abused for what he did at Silverbridge; and I\r\nreally don\'t see why he wasn\'t to have his money. It was I that made\r\nhim spend it."\r\n\r\n"He was, I fancy, a thoroughly bad man."\r\n\r\n"But a wife doesn\'t always want to be made a widow even if her\r\nhusband be bad. I think I owe her something, and I would pay my debt\r\nif I knew how. I shall go and see her, and if she will marry this\r\nother man we\'ll take her by the hand. Good-bye, dear. You\'d better\r\ncome to me early to-morrow, as I suppose we shall know something by\r\neleven o\'clock."\r\n\r\nIn the course of that evening the Duke of St. Bungay came to Carlton\r\nTerrace and was closeted for some time with the late Prime Minister.\r\nHe had been engaged during that and the last two previous days in\r\nlending his aid to various political manoeuvres and ministerial\r\nattempts, from which our Duke had kept himself altogether aloof. He\r\ndid not go to Windsor, but as each successive competitor journeyed\r\nthither and returned, some one either sent for the old Duke or went\r\nto seek his counsel. He was the Nestor of the occasion, and strove\r\nheartily to compose all quarrels, and so to arrange matters that a\r\nwholesome, moderately Liberal Ministry might be again installed for\r\nthe good of the country and the comfort of all true Whigs. In such\r\nmoments he almost ascended to the grand heights of patriotism, being\r\nalways indifferent as to himself. Now he came to his late chief with\r\na new project. Mr. Gresham would attempt to form a Ministry if the\r\nDuke of Omnium would join him.\r\n\r\n"It is impossible," said the younger politician, folding his hands\r\ntogether and throwing himself back in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me before you answer me with such certainty. There are\r\nthree or four gentlemen who, after the work of the last three\r\nyears, bearing in mind the manner in which our defeat has just been\r\naccomplished, feel themselves disinclined to join Mr. Gresham unless\r\nyou will do so also. I may specially name Mr. Monk and Mr. Finn. I\r\nmight perhaps add myself, were it not that I had hoped that in any\r\nevent I might at length regard myself as exempt from further service.\r\nThe old horse should be left to graze out his last days, Ne peccet ad\r\nextremum ridendus. But you can\'t consider yourself absolved on that\r\nscore."\r\n\r\n"There are other reasons."\r\n\r\n"But the Queen\'s service should count before everything. Gresham and\r\nCantrip with their own friends can hardly make a Ministry as things\r\nare now unless Mr. Monk will join them. I do not think that any other\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer is at present possible."\r\n\r\n"I will beseech Mr. Monk not to let any feeling as to me stand in his\r\nway. Why should it?"\r\n\r\n"It is not only what you may think and he may think,--but what others\r\nwill think and say. The Coalition will have done all that ought\r\nto have been expected from it if our party in it can now join Mr.\r\nGresham."\r\n\r\n"By all means. But I could give them no strength. They may be sure at\r\nany rate of what little I can do for them out of office."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gresham has made his acceptance of office,--well, I will not\r\nsay strictly conditional on your joining him. That would hardly be\r\ncorrect. But he has expressed himself quite willing to make the\r\nattempt with your aid, and doubtful whether he can succeed without\r\nit. He suggests that you should join him as President of the\r\nCouncil."\r\n\r\n"And you?"\r\n\r\n"If I were wanted at all I should take the Privy Seal."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, my friend. If there were any question of my return\r\nwe would reverse the offices. But I think I may say that my mind is\r\nfixed. If you wish it I will see Mr. Monk, and do all that I can to\r\nget him to go with you. But for myself,--I feel that it would be\r\nuseless."\r\n\r\nAt last, at the Duke\'s pressing request, he agreed to take\r\ntwenty-four hours before he gave his final answer to the proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII\r\n\r\nThe Duchess in Manchester Square\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke said not a word to his wife as to this new proposition, and\r\nwhen she asked him what tidings their old friend had brought as to\r\nthe state of affairs, he almost told a fib in his anxiety to escape\r\nfrom her persecution. "He is in some doubt what he means to do\r\nhimself," said the Duke. The Duchess asked many questions, but got no\r\nsatisfactory reply to any of them. Nor did Mrs. Finn learn anything\r\nfrom her husband, whom, however, she did not interrogate very\r\nclosely. She would be contented to know when the proper time might\r\ncome for ladies to be informed. The Duke, however, was determined\r\nto take his twenty-four hours all alone,--or at any rate not to be\r\ndriven to his decision by feminine interference.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Duchess went to Manchester Square intent on\r\nperforming certain good offices on behalf of the poor widow. It may\r\nbe doubted whether she had clearly made up her mind what it was that\r\nshe could do, though she was clear that some debt was due by her to\r\nMrs. Lopez. And she knew too in what direction assistance might be\r\nserviceable, if only it could in this case be given. She had heard\r\nthat the present member for Silverbridge had been the lady\'s lover\r\nlong before Mr. Lopez had come upon the scene, and with those\r\nfeminine wiles of which she was a perfect mistress she had extracted\r\nfrom him a confession that his mind was unaltered. She liked Arthur\r\nFletcher,--as indeed she had for a time liked Ferdinand Lopez,--and\r\nfelt that her conscience would be easier if she could assist in this\r\ngood work. She built castles in the air as to the presence of the\r\nbride and bridegroom at Matching, thinking how she might thus repair\r\nthe evil she had done. But her heart misgave her a little as she\r\ndrew near to the house, and remembered how very slight was her\r\nacquaintance and how extremely delicate the mission on which she had\r\ncome. But she was not the woman to turn back when she had once put\r\nher foot to any work; and she was driven up to the door in Manchester\r\nSquare without any expressed hesitation on her own part. "Yes,--his\r\nmistress was at home," said the butler, still shrinking at the sound\r\nof the name which he hated. The Duchess was then shown upstairs, and\r\nwas left alone for some minutes in the drawing-room. It was a large\r\nhandsome apartment, hung round with valuable pictures, and having\r\nsigns of considerable wealth. Since she had first invited Lopez to\r\nstand for Silverbridge she had heard much about him, and had wondered\r\nhow he had gained possession of such a girl as Emily Wharton. And\r\nnow, as she looked about, her wonder was increased. She knew enough\r\nof such people as the Whartons and the Fletchers to be aware that\r\nas a class they are more impregnable, more closely guarded by their\r\nfeelings and prejudices against strangers than any other. None keep\r\ntheir daughters to themselves with greater care, or are less willing\r\nto see their rules of life changed or abolished. And yet this man,\r\nhalf foreigner half Jew,--and as it now appeared, whole pauper,--had\r\nstepped in and carried off a prize for which such a one as Arthur\r\nFletcher was contending! The Duchess had never seen Emily but\r\nonce,--so as to observe her well,--and had then thought her to be a\r\nvery handsome woman. It had been at the garden party at Richmond,\r\nand Lopez had then insisted that his wife should be well dressed. It\r\nwould perhaps have been impossible in the whole of that assembly to\r\nfind a more beautiful woman than Mrs. Lopez then was,--or one who\r\ncarried herself with a finer air. Now when she entered the room in\r\nher deep mourning it would have been difficult to recognise her. Her\r\nface was much thinner, her eyes apparently larger, and her colour\r\nfaded. And there had come a settled seriousness on her face which\r\nseemed to rob her of her youth. Arthur Fletcher had declared that as\r\nhe saw her now she was more beautiful than ever. But Arthur Fletcher,\r\nin looking at her, saw more than her mere features. To his eyes there\r\nwas a tenderness added by her sorrow which had its own attraction\r\nfor him. And he was so well versed in every line of her countenance,\r\nthat he could see there the old loveliness behind the sorrow; the\r\nloveliness which would come forth again, as bright as ever, if the\r\nsorrow could be removed. But the Duchess, though she remembered the\r\nwoman\'s beauty as she might that of any other lady, now saw nothing\r\nbut a thing of woe wrapped in customary widow\'s weeds. "I hope," she\r\nsaid, "I am not intruding in coming to you; but I have been anxious\r\nto renew our acquaintance for reasons which I am sure you will\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\nEmily at the moment hardly knew how to address her august visitor.\r\nThough her father had lived all his life in what is called good\r\nsociety, he had not consorted much with dukes and duchesses. She\r\nherself had indeed on one occasion been for an hour or two the guest\r\nof this grand lady, but on that occasion she had hardly been called\r\nupon to talk to her. Now she doubted how to name the Duchess, and\r\nwith some show of hesitation decided at last upon not naming her at\r\nall. "It is very good of you to come," she said in a faltering voice.\r\n\r\n"I told you that I would when I wrote, you know. That is many months\r\nago, but I have not forgotten it. You have been in the country since\r\nthat, I think?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in Herefordshire. Herefordshire is our county."\r\n\r\n"I know all about it," said the Duchess, smiling. She generally did\r\ncontrive to learn "all about" the people whom she chose to take by\r\nthe hand. "We have a Herefordshire gentleman sitting for,--I must\r\nnot say our borough of Silverbridge." She was anxious to make some\r\nallusion to Arthur Fletcher; but it was difficult to travel on that\r\nSilverbridge ground, as Lopez had been her chosen candidate when she\r\nstill wished to claim the borough as an appanage of the Palliser\r\nfamily. Emily, however, kept her countenance and did not show by any\r\nsign that her thoughts were running in that direction. "And though we\r\ndon\'t presume to regard Mr. Fletcher," continued the Duchess, "as in\r\nany way connected with our local interests, he has always supported\r\nthe Duke, and I hope has become a friend of ours. I think he is a\r\nneighbour of yours in the country."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. My cousin is married to his brother."\r\n\r\n"I knew there was something of that kind. He told me that there was\r\nsome close alliance." The Duchess as she looked at the woman to whom\r\nshe wanted to be kind did not as yet dare to express a wish that\r\nthere might at some not very distant time be a closer alliance. She\r\nhad come there intending to do so; and had still some hope that she\r\nmight do it before the interview was over. But at any rate she would\r\nnot do it yet. "Have I not heard," she said, "something of another\r\nmarriage?"\r\n\r\n"My brother is going to marry his cousin, Sir Alured Wharton\'s\r\ndaughter."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--I thought it had been one of the Fletchers. It was our member\r\nwho told me, and he spoke as though they were all his very dear\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"They are dear friends,--very." Poor Emily still didn\'t know whether\r\nto call her Duchess, my Lady, or your Grace,--and yet felt the need\r\nof calling her by some special name.\r\n\r\n"Exactly. I supposed it was so. They tell me Mr. Fletcher will become\r\nquite a favourite in the House. At this present moment nobody knows\r\non which side anybody is going to sit to-morrow. It may be that Mr.\r\nFletcher will become the dire enemy of all the Duke\'s friends."\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m speaking of political enemies. Political enemies are\r\noften the best friends in the world; and I can assure you from my own\r\nexperience that political friends are often the bitterest enemies.\r\nI never hated any people so much as some of our supporters." The\r\nDuchess made a grimace, and Emily could not refrain from smiling.\r\n"Yes, indeed. There\'s an old saying that misfortune makes strange\r\nbedfellows, but political friendship makes stranger alliances than\r\nmisfortune. Perhaps you never met Sir Timothy Beeswax."\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Well;--don\'t. But, as I was saying, there is no knowing who may\r\nsupport whom now. If I were asked who would be Prime Minister\r\nto-morrow, I should take half-a-dozen names and shake them in a bag."\r\n\r\n"It is not settled then?"\r\n\r\n"Settled! No, indeed. Nothing is settled." At that moment indeed\r\neverything was settled, though the Duchess did not know it. "And so\r\nwe none of us can tell how Mr. Fletcher may stand with us when things\r\nare arranged. I suppose he calls himself a Conservative?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!"\r\n\r\n"All the Whartons, I suppose, are Conservatives,--and all the\r\nFletchers."\r\n\r\n"Very nearly. Papa calls himself a Tory."\r\n\r\n"A very much better name, to my thinking. We are all Whigs, of\r\ncourse. A Palliser who was not a Whig would be held to have disgraced\r\nhimself for ever. Are not politics odd? A few years ago I only barely\r\nknew what the word meant, and that not correctly. Lately I have been\r\nso eager about it, that there hardly seems to be anything else left\r\nworth living for. I suppose it\'s wrong, but a state of pugnacity\r\nseems to me the greatest bliss which we can reach here on earth."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t like to be always fighting."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you haven\'t known Sir Timothy Beeswax and two or\r\nthree other gentlemen whom I could name. The day will come, I dare\r\nsay, when you will care for politics."\r\n\r\nEmily was about to answer, hardly knowing what to say, when the\r\ndoor was opened and Mrs. Roby came into the room. The lady was not\r\nannounced, and Emily had heard no knock at the door. She was forced\r\nto go through some ceremony of introduction. "This is my aunt, Mrs.\r\nRoby," she said. "Aunt Harriet, the Duchess of Omnium." Mrs. Roby was\r\nbeside herself,--not all with joy. That feeling would come afterwards\r\nas she would boast to her friends of her new acquaintance. At present\r\nthere was the embarrassment of not quite knowing how to behave\r\nherself. The Duchess bowed from her seat, and smiled sweetly,--as\r\nshe had learned to smile since her husband had become Prime Minister.\r\nMrs. Roby curtsied, and then remembered that in these days only\r\nhousemaids ought to curtsey.\r\n\r\n"Anything to our Mr. Roby?" said the Duchess, continuing her\r\nsmile,--"ours as he was till yesterday at least." This she said in an\r\nabsurd wail of mock sorrow.\r\n\r\n"My brother-in-law, your Grace," said Mrs. Roby, delighted.\r\n\r\n"Oh indeed. And what does Mr. Roby think about it, I wonder? But I\r\ndare say you have found, Mrs. Roby, that when a crisis comes,--a real\r\ncrisis,--the ladies are told nothing. I have."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think, your Grace, that Mr. Roby ever divulges political\r\nsecrets."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t he indeed! What a dull man your brother-in-law must be to\r\nlive with,--that is as a politician! Good-bye, Mrs. Lopez. You must\r\ncome and see me and let me come to you again. I hope, you know,--I\r\nhope the time may come when things may once more be bright with you."\r\nThese last words she murmured almost in a whisper, as she held the\r\nhand of the woman she wished to befriend. Then she bowed to Mrs.\r\nRoby, and left the room.\r\n\r\n"What was it she said to you?" asked Mrs. Roby.\r\n\r\n"Nothing in particular, Aunt Harriet."\r\n\r\n"She seems to be very friendly. What made her come?"\r\n\r\n"She wrote some time ago to say she would call."\r\n\r\n"But why?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you. I don\'t know. Don\'t ask me, aunt, about things\r\nthat are passed. You cannot do it without wounding me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to wound you, Emily, but I really think that that is\r\nnonsense. She is a very nice woman;--though I don\'t think she ought\r\nto have said that Mr. Roby is dull. Did Mr. Wharton know that she was\r\ncoming?"\r\n\r\n"He knew that she said she would come," replied Emily very sternly,\r\nso that Mrs. Roby found herself compelled to pass on to some other\r\nsubject. Mrs. Roby had heard the wish expressed that something "once\r\nmore might be bright," and when she got home told her husband that\r\nshe was sure that Emily Lopez was going to marry Arthur Fletcher.\r\n"And why the d---- shouldn\'t she?" said Dick. "And that poor man\r\ndestroying himself not much more than twelve months ago! I couldn\'t\r\ndo it," said Mrs. Roby. "I don\'t mean to give you the chance," said\r\nDick.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess when she went away suffered under a sense of failure. She\r\nhad intended to bring about some crisis of female tenderness in which\r\nshe might have rushed into future hopes and joyous anticipations, and\r\nwith the freedom which will come from ebullitions of feeling, have\r\ntold the widow that the peculiar circumstances of her position would\r\nnot only justify her in marrying this other man but absolutely called\r\nupon her to do it. Unfortunately she had failed in her attempt to\r\nbring the interview to a condition in which this would have been\r\npossible, and while she was still making the attempt that odious\r\naunt had come in. "I have been on my mission," she said to Mrs. Finn\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n"Have you done any good?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I\'ve done any harm. Women, you know, are so very\r\ndifferent! There are some who would delight to have an opportunity\r\nof opening their hearts to a Duchess, and who might almost be talked\r\ninto anything in an ecstasy."\r\n\r\n"Hardly women of the best sort, Lady Glen."\r\n\r\n"Not of the best sort. But then one doesn\'t come across the very\r\nbest, very often. But that kind of thing does have an effect; and as\r\nI only wanted to do good, I wish she had been one of the sort for the\r\noccasion."\r\n\r\n"Was she--offended?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no. You don\'t suppose I attacked her with a husband at the\r\nfirst word. Indeed, I didn\'t attack her at all. She didn\'t give me an\r\nopportunity. Such a Niobe you never saw."\r\n\r\n"Was she weeping?"\r\n\r\n"Not actual tears. But her gown, and her cap, and her strings were\r\nweeping. Her voice wept, and her hair, and her nose, and her mouth.\r\nDon\'t you know that look of subdued mourning? And yet they say that\r\nthat man is dying for love. How beautiful it is to see that there is\r\nsuch a thing as constancy left in the world."\r\n\r\nWhen she got home she found that her husband had just returned from\r\nthe old Duke\'s house, where he had met Mr. Monk, Mr. Gresham, and\r\nLord Cantrip. "It\'s all settled at last," he said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII\r\n\r\nThe New Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the ex-Prime Minister was left by himself after the departure of\r\nhis old friend his first feeling had been one of regret that he had\r\nbeen weak enough to doubt at all. He had long since made up his mind\r\nthat after all that had passed he could not return to office as a\r\nsubordinate. That feeling as to the impropriety of Caesar descending\r\nto serve under others which he had been foolish enough to express,\r\nhad been strong with him from the very commencement of his Ministry.\r\nWhen first asked to take the place which he had filled the reason\r\nstrong against it had been the conviction that it would probably\r\nexclude him from political work during the latter half of his life.\r\nThe man who has written Q.C. after his name must abandon his practice\r\nbehind the bar. As he then was, although he had already been driven\r\nby the unhappy circumstance of his peerage from the House of Commons\r\nwhich he loved so well, there were still open to him many fields of\r\npolitical work. But if he should once consent to stand on the top\r\nrung of the ladder, he could not, he thought, take a lower place\r\nwithout degradation. Till he should have been placed quite at the top\r\nno shifting his place from this higher to that lower office would\r\ninjure him in his own estimation. The exigencies of the service and\r\nnot defeat would produce such changes as that. But he could not go\r\ndown from being Prime Minister and serve under some other chief\r\nwithout acknowledging himself to have been unfit for the place he\r\nhad filled. Of all that he had quite assured himself. And yet he had\r\nallowed the old Duke to talk him into a doubt!\r\n\r\nAs he sat considering the question he acknowledged that there might\r\nhave been room for doubt, though in the present emergency there\r\ncertainly was none. He could imagine circumstances in which the\r\nexperience of an individual in some special branch of his country\'s\r\nservice might be of such paramount importance to the country as to\r\nmake it incumbent on a man to sacrifice all personal feeling. But it\r\nwas not so with him. There was nothing now which he could do, which\r\nanother might not do as well. That blessed task of introducing\r\ndecimals into all the commercial relations of British life, which\r\nhad once kept him aloft in the air, floating as upon eagle\'s wings,\r\nhad been denied him. If ever done it must be done from the House of\r\nCommons; and the people of the country had become deaf to the charms\r\nof that great reform. Othello\'s occupation was, in truth, altogether\r\ngone, and there was no reason by which he could justify to himself\r\nthe step down in the world which the old Duke had proposed to him.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning he left Carlton Terrace on foot and\r\nwalked as far as Mr. Monk\'s house, which was close to St. James\'s\r\nStreet. Here at eleven o\'clock he found his late Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer in that state of tedious agitation in which a man is kept\r\nwho does not yet know whether he is or is not to be one of the actors\r\nin the play just about to be performed. The Duke had never before\r\nbeen in Mr. Monk\'s very humble abode, and now caused some surprise.\r\nMr. Monk knew that he might probably be sent for, but had not\r\nexpected that any of the ex-Prime Ministers of the day would come\r\nto him. People had said that not improbably he himself might be\r\nthe man,--but he himself had indulged in no such dream. Office had\r\nhad no great charms for him;--and if there was one man of the late\r\nGovernment who could lay it down without a personal regret, it was\r\nMr. Monk. "I wish you to come with me to the Duke\'s house in St.\r\nJames\'s Square," said the late Prime Minister. "I think we shall find\r\nhim at home."\r\n\r\n"Certainly. I will come this moment." Then there was not a word\r\nspoken till the two men were in the street together. "Of course I\r\nam a little anxious," said Mr. Monk. "Have you anything to tell me\r\nbefore we get there?"\r\n\r\n"You of course must return to office, Mr. Monk."\r\n\r\n"With your Grace--I certainly will do so."\r\n\r\n"And without, if there be the need. They who are wanted should be\r\nforthcoming. But perhaps you will let me postpone what I have to say\r\ntill we see the Duke. What a charming morning;--is it not? How sweet\r\nit would be down in the country." March had gone out like a lamb, and\r\neven in London the early April days were sweet,--to be followed, no\r\ndoubt, by the usual nipping inclemency of May. "I never can get over\r\nthe feeling," continued the Duke, "that Parliament should sit for the\r\nsix winter months, instead of in summer. If we met on the first of\r\nOctober, how glorious it would be to get away for the early spring!"\r\n\r\n"Nothing less strong than grouse could break up Parliament," said Mr.\r\nMonk; "and then what would the pheasants and the foxes say?"\r\n\r\n"It is giving up almost too much to our amusements. I used to think\r\nthat I should like to move for a return of the number of hunting and\r\nshooting gentlemen in both Houses. I believe it would be a small\r\nminority."\r\n\r\n"But their sons shoot, and their daughters hunt, and all their\r\nhangers-on would be against it."\r\n\r\n"Custom is against us, Mr. Monk; that is it. Here we are. I hope my\r\nfriend will not be out, looking up young Lords of the Treasury." The\r\nDuke of St. Bungay was not in search of cadets for the Government,\r\nbut was at this very moment closeted with Mr. Gresham, and Mr.\r\nGresham\'s especial friend Lord Cantrip. He had been at this\r\nwork so long and so constantly that his very servants had their\r\nministerial-crisis manners and felt and enjoyed the importance of the\r\noccasion. The two newcomers were soon allowed to enter the august\r\nconclave, and the five great senators greeted each other cordially.\r\n"I hope we have not come inopportunely," said the Duke of Omnium. Mr.\r\nGresham assured him almost with hilarity that nothing could be less\r\ninopportune;--and then the Duke was sure that Mr. Gresham was to\r\nbe the new Prime Minister, whoever might join him or whoever might\r\nrefuse to do so. "I told my friend here," continued our Duke, laying\r\nhis hand upon the old man\'s arm, "that I would give him his answer to\r\na proposition he made me within twenty-four hours. But I find that I\r\ncan do so without that delay."\r\n\r\n"I trust your Grace\'s answer may be favourable to us," said Mr.\r\nGresham,--who indeed did not doubt much that it would be so, seeing\r\nthat Mr. Monk had accompanied him.\r\n\r\n"I do not think that it will be unfavourable, though I cannot do as\r\nmy friend has proposed."\r\n\r\n"Any practicable arrangement--" began Mr. Gresham, with a frown,\r\nhowever, on his brow.\r\n\r\n"The most practicable arrangement, I am sure, will be for you to\r\nform your Government without hampering yourself with a beaten\r\npredecessor."\r\n\r\n"Not beaten," said Lord Cantrip.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said the other Duke.\r\n\r\n"It is because of your success that I ask your services," said Mr.\r\nGresham.\r\n\r\n"I have none to give,--none that I cannot better bestow out of office\r\nthan in. I must ask you, gentlemen, to believe that I am quite fixed.\r\nComing here with my friend Mr. Monk, I did not state my purpose to\r\nhim; but I begged him to accompany me, fearing lest in my absence he\r\nshould feel it incumbent on himself to sail in the same boat with his\r\nlate colleague."\r\n\r\n"I should prefer to do so," said Mr. Monk.\r\n\r\n"Of course it is not for me to say what may be Mr. Gresham\'s ideas;\r\nbut as my friend here suggested to me that, were I to return to\r\noffice, Mr. Monk would do so also, I cannot be wrong in surmising\r\nthat his services are desired." Mr. Gresham bowed assent. "I shall\r\ntherefore take the liberty of telling Mr. Monk that I think he is\r\nbound to give his aid in the present emergency. Were I as happily\r\nplaced as he is in being the possessor of a seat in the House of\r\nCommons, I too should hope that I might do something."\r\n\r\nThe four gentlemen, with eager pressure, begged the Duke to\r\nreconsider his decision. He could take this office and do nothing in\r\nit,--there being, as we all know, offices the holders of which are\r\nnot called upon for work,--or he could take that place which would\r\nrequire him to labour like a galley slave. Would he be Privy Seal?\r\nWould he undertake the India Board? But the Duke of Omnium was at\r\nlast resolute. Of this administration he would not at any rate be\r\na member. Whether Caesar might or might not at some future time\r\ncondescend to command a legion, he could not do so when the purple\r\nhad been but that moment stripped from his shoulders. He soon\r\nafterwards left the house with a repeated request to Mr. Monk that\r\nhe would not follow his late chief\'s example.\r\n\r\n"I regret it greatly," said Mr. Gresham when he was gone.\r\n\r\n"There is no man," said Lord Cantrip, "whom all who know him more\r\nthoroughly respect."\r\n\r\n"He has been worried," said the old Duke, "and must take time\r\nto recover himself. He has but one fault,--he is a little too\r\nconscientious, a little too scrupulous." Mr. Monk, of course, did\r\njoin them, making one or two stipulations as he did so. He required\r\nthat his friend Phineas Finn should be included in the Government.\r\nMr. Gresham yielded, though poor Phineas was not among the most\r\nfavoured friends of that statesman. And so the Government was formed,\r\nand the crisis was again over, and the lists which all the newspapers\r\nhad been publishing for the last three days were republished in an\r\namended and nearly correct condition. The triumph of the "People\'s\r\nBanner," as to the omission of the Duke, was of course complete. The\r\neditor had no hesitation in declaring that he, by his own sagacity\r\nand persistency, had made certain the exclusion of that very unfit\r\nand very pressing candidate for office.\r\n\r\nThe list was filled up after the usual fashion. For a while the\r\ndilettanti politicians of the clubs, and the strong-minded women who\r\ntake an interest in such things, and the writers in newspapers, had\r\nalmost doubted whether, in the emergency which had been supposed to\r\nbe so peculiar, any Government could be formed. There had been,--so\r\nthey had said,--peculiarities so peculiar that it might be that the\r\nmuch-dreaded deadlock had come at last. A Coalition had been possible\r\nand, though antagonistic to British feelings generally, had carried\r\non the Government. But what might succeed the Coalition, nobody had\r\nknown. The Radicals and Liberals together would be too strong for Mr.\r\nDaubeny and Sir Orlando. Mr. Gresham had no longer a party of his own\r\nat his back, and a second Coalition would be generally spurned. In\r\nthis way there had been much political excitement, and a fair amount\r\nof consequent enjoyment. But after a few days the old men had rattled\r\ninto their old places,--or, generally, old men into new places,--and\r\nit was understood that Mr. Gresham would be again supported by a\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nAs we grow old it is a matter of interest to watch how the natural\r\ngaps are filled in the two ranks of parliamentary workmen by whom the\r\nGovernment is carried on, either in the one interest or the other. Of\r\ncourse there must be gaps. Some men become too old,--though that is\r\nrarely the case. A Peel may perish, or even a Palmerston must die.\r\nSome men, though long supported by interest, family connection, or\r\nthe loyalty of colleagues, are weighed down at last by their own\r\nincapacity and sink into peerages. Now and again a man cannot bear\r\nthe bondage of office, and flies into rebellion and independence\r\nwhich would have been more respectable had it not been the result of\r\ndiscontent. Then the gaps must be filled. Whether on this side or on\r\nthat, the candidates are first looked for among the sons of Earls and\r\nDukes,--and not unnaturally, as the sons of Earls and Dukes may be\r\neducated for such work almost from their infancy. A few rise by the\r\nslow process of acknowledged fitness,--men who probably at first have\r\nnot thought of office but are chosen because they are wanted, and\r\nwhose careers are grudged them, not by their opponents or rivals, but\r\nby the Browns and Joneses of the world who cannot bear to see a Smith\r\nor a Walker become something so different to themselves. These men\r\nhave a great weight to carry, and cannot always shake off the burden\r\nof their origin and live among begotten statesmen as though they\r\ntoo had been born to the manner. But perhaps the most wonderful\r\nministerial phenomenon,--though now almost too common to be longer\r\ncalled a phenomenon,--is he who rises high in power and place\r\nby having made himself thoroughly detested and also,--alas for\r\nparliamentary cowardice!--thoroughly feared. Given sufficient\r\naudacity, a thick skin, and power to bear for a few years the evil\r\nlooks and cold shoulders of his comrades, and that is the man most\r\nsure to make his way to some high seat. But the skin must be thicker\r\nthan that of any animal known, and the audacity must be complete. To\r\nthe man who will once shrink at the idea of being looked at askance\r\nfor treachery, or hated for his ill condition, the career is\r\nimpossible. But let him be obdurate, and the bid will come. "Not\r\nbecause I want him, do I ask for him," says some groaning chief\r\nof a party,--to himself, and also sufficiently aloud for others\'\r\nears,--"but because he stings me and goads me, and will drive me\r\nto madness as a foe." Then the pachydermatous one enters into the\r\nother\'s heaven, probably with the resolution already formed of\r\nousting that unhappy angel. And so it was in the present instance.\r\nWhen Mr. Gresham\'s completed list was published to the world, the\r\nworld was astonished to find that Sir Timothy was to be Mr. Gresham\'s\r\nAttorney-General. Sir Gregory Grogram became Lord Chancellor, and the\r\nLiberal chief was content to borrow his senior law adviser from the\r\nConservative side of the late Coalition. It could not be that Mr.\r\nGresham was very fond of Sir Timothy;--but Sir Timothy in the late\r\ndebates had shown himself to be a man of whom a minister might well\r\nbe afraid.\r\n\r\nImmediately on leaving the old Duke\'s house, the late Premier went\r\nhome to his wife, and, finding that she was out, waited for her\r\nreturn. Now that he had put his own decision beyond his own power he\r\nwas anxious to let her know how it was to be with them. "I think it\r\nis settled at last," he said.\r\n\r\n"And you are coming back?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not that. I believe I may say that Mr. Gresham is Prime\r\nMinister."\r\n\r\n"Then he oughtn\'t to be," said the Duchess crossly.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that I must differ from you, my dear, because I think he\r\nis the fittest man in England for the place."\r\n\r\n"And you?"\r\n\r\n"I am a private gentleman who will now be able to devote more of his\r\ntime to his wife and children than has hitherto been possible with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"How very nice! Do you mean to say that you like it?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure that I ought to like it. At the present moment I am\r\nthinking more of what you will like."\r\n\r\n"If you ask me, Plantagenet, you know I shall tell the truth."\r\n\r\n"Then tell the truth."\r\n\r\n"After drinking brandy so long I hardly think that 12s. claret will\r\nagree with my stomach. You ask for the truth, and there it is,--very\r\nplainly."\r\n\r\n"Plain enough!"\r\n\r\n"You asked, you know."\r\n\r\n"And I am glad to have been told, even though that which you tell\r\nme is not pleasant hearing. When a man has been drinking too much\r\nbrandy, it may be well that he should be put on a course of 12s.\r\nclaret."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t like it; and then,--it\'s kill or cure."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you\'re gone so far, Cora, that we need fear that the\r\nremedy will be fatal."\r\n\r\n"I am thinking of you rather than myself. I can make myself generally\r\ndisagreeable, and get excitement in that way. But what will you do?\r\nIt\'s all very well to talk of me and the children, but you can\'t\r\nbring in a Bill for reforming us. You can\'t make us go by decimals.\r\nYou can\'t increase our consumption by lowering our taxation. I wish\r\nyou had gone back to some Board." This she said looking up into his\r\nface with an anxiety which was half real and half burlesque.\r\n\r\n"I had made up my mind to go back to no Board,--for the present. I\r\nwas thinking that we could spend some months in Italy, Cora."\r\n\r\n"What; for the summer;--so as to be in Rome in July! After that we\r\ncould utilise the winter by visiting Norway."\r\n\r\n"We might take Norway first."\r\n\r\n"And be eaten up by mosquitoes! I\'ve got to be too old to like\r\ntravelling."\r\n\r\n"What do you like, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing;--except being the Prime Minister\'s wife; and upon my word\r\nthere were times when I didn\'t like that very much. I don\'t know\r\nanything else that I\'m fit for. I wonder whether Mr. Gresham would\r\nlet me go to him as housekeeper? Only we should have to lend him\r\nGatherum, or there would be no room for the display of my abilities.\r\nIs Mr. Monk in?"\r\n\r\n"He keeps his old office."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Finn?"\r\n\r\n"I believe so; but in what place I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"And who else?"\r\n\r\n"Our old friend the Duke, and Lord Cantrip, and Mr. Wilson,--and Sir\r\nGregory will be Lord Chancellor."\r\n\r\n"Just the old stupid Liberal team. Put their names in a bag and shake\r\nthem, and you can always get a ministry. Well, Plantagenet;--I\'ll go\r\nanywhere you like to take me. I\'ll have something for the malaria at\r\nRome, and something for the mosquitoes in Norway, and will make the\r\nbest of it. But I don\'t see why you should run away in the middle of\r\nthe Session. I would stay and pitch into them, all round, like a true\r\nex-minister and independent member of Parliament." Then as he was\r\nleaving her she fired a last shot. "I hope you made Sir Orlando and\r\nSir Timothy peers before you gave up."\r\n\r\nIt was not till two days after this that she read in one of the daily\r\npapers that Sir Timothy Beeswax was to be Attorney-General, and then\r\nher patience almost deserted her. To tell the truth, her husband had\r\nnot dared to mention the appointment when he first saw her after\r\nhearing it. Her explosion first fell on the head of Phineas Finn,\r\nwhom she found at home with his wife, deploring the necessity which\r\nhad fallen upon him of filling the faineant office of Chancellor of\r\nthe Duchy of Lancaster. "Mr. Finn," she said, "I congratulate you on\r\nyour colleagues."\r\n\r\n"Your Grace is very good. I was at any rate introduced to many of\r\nthem under the Duke\'s auspices."\r\n\r\n"And ought, I think, to have seen enough of them to be ashamed of\r\nthem. Such a regiment to march through Coventry with!"\r\n\r\n"I do not doubt that we shall be good enough men for any enemies we\r\nmay meet."\r\n\r\n"It cannot but be that you should conquer all the world with such a\r\nhero among you as Sir Timothy Beeswax. The idea of Sir Timothy coming\r\nback again! What do you feel about it?"\r\n\r\n"Very indifferent, Duchess. He won\'t interfere much with me, as I\r\nhave an Attorney-General of my own. You see I\'m especially safe."\r\n\r\n"I do believe men would do anything," said the Duchess, turning to\r\nMrs. Finn. "Of course I mean in the way of politics! But I did not\r\nthink it possible that the Duke of St. Bungay should again be in the\r\nsame Government with Sir Timothy Beeswax."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX\r\n\r\nThe Wharton Wedding\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at last settled that the Wharton marriage should take place\r\nduring the second week in June. There were various reasons for\r\nthe postponement. In the first place Mary Wharton, after a few\r\npreliminary inquiries, found herself forced to declare that Messrs.\r\nMuddocks and Cramble could not send her forth equipped as she ought\r\nto be equipped for such a husband in so short a time. "Perhaps they\r\ndo it quicker in London," she said to Everett with a soft regret,\r\nremembering the metropolitan glories of her sister\'s wedding.\r\nAnd then Arthur Fletcher could be present during the Whitsuntide\r\nholidays; and the presence of Arthur Fletcher was essential. And it\r\nwas not only his presence at the altar that was needed;--Parliament\r\nwas not so exacting but that he might have given that;--but it was\r\nconsidered by the united families to be highly desirable that he\r\nshould on this occasion remain some days in the country. Emily had\r\npromised to attend the wedding, and would of course be at Wharton\r\nfor at least a week. As soon as Everett had succeeded in wresting a\r\npromise from his sister, the tidings were conveyed to Fletcher. It\r\nwas a great step gained. When in London she was her own mistress; but\r\nsurrounded as she would be down in Herefordshire by Fletchers and\r\nWhartons, she must be stubborn indeed if she should still refuse to\r\nbe taken back into the flock, and be made once more happy by marrying\r\nthe man whom she confessed that she loved with her whole heart. The\r\nletter to Arthur Fletcher containing the news was from his brother\r\nJohn, and was written in a very business-like fashion. "We have put\r\noff Mary\'s marriage a few days, so that you and she should be down\r\nhere together. If you mean to go on with it, now is your time."\r\nArthur, in answer to this, merely said he would spend the Whitsuntide\r\nholidays at Longbarns.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Emily herself had some idea in her own mind of\r\nwhat was being done to entrap her. Her brother\'s words to her had\r\nbeen so strong, and the occasion of his marriage was itself so sacred\r\nto her, that she had not been able to refuse his request. But from\r\nthe moment that she had made the promise, she felt that she had\r\ngreatly added to her own difficulties. That she could yield to\r\nArthur never occurred to her. She was certain of her own persistency.\r\nWhatever might be the wishes of others, the fitness of things\r\nrequired that Arthur Fletcher\'s wife should not have been the widow\r\nof Ferdinand Lopez,--and required also that the woman who had married\r\nFerdinand Lopez should bear the results of her own folly. Though\r\nsince his death she had never spoken a syllable against him,--if\r\nthose passionate words be excepted which Arthur himself had drawn\r\nfrom her,--still she had not refrained from acknowledging the truth\r\nto herself. He had been a man disgraced,--and she as his wife, having\r\nbecome his wife in opposition to the wishes of all her friends, was\r\ndisgraced also. Let them do what they will with her, she would not\r\nsoil Arthur Fletcher\'s name with this infamy. Such was still her\r\nsteadfast resolution; but she knew that it would be, not endangered,\r\nbut increased in difficulty by this visit to Herefordshire.\r\n\r\nAnd then there were other troubles. "Papa," she said, "I must get a\r\ndress for Everett\'s marriage."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear, after all that I have cost you, putting you to such\r\nuseless expense."\r\n\r\n"It is not useless, and such expenses as that I can surely afford\r\nwithout groaning. Do it handsomely and you will please me best."\r\n\r\nThen she went forth and chose her dress,--a grey silk, light enough\r\nnot to throw quite a gloom on the brightness of the day, and yet dark\r\nenough to declare that she was not as other women are. The very act\r\nof purchasing this, almost blushing at her own request as she sat at\r\nthe counter in her widow\'s weeds, was a pain to her. But she had no\r\none whom she could employ. On such an occasion she could not ask her\r\naunt Harriet to act for her, as her aunt was distrusted and disliked.\r\nAnd then there was the fitting on of the dress,--very grievous to\r\nher, as it was the first time since the heavy black mourning came\r\nhome that she had clothed herself in other garments.\r\n\r\nThe day before that fixed for the marriage she and her father went\r\ndown to Herefordshire together, the conversation on the way being\r\nall in respect to Everett. Where was he to live? What was he to do?\r\nWhat income would he require till he should inherit the good things\r\nwhich destiny had in store for him? The old man seemed to feel that\r\nProvidence, having been so very good to his son in killing that other\r\nheir, had put rather a heavy burden on himself. "He\'ll want a house\r\nof his own, of course," he said, in a somewhat lachrymose tone.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'ll spend a good deal of his time at Wharton."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t be content to live in another man\'s house altogether, my\r\ndear; and Sir Alured can allow him nothing. It means, of course, that\r\nI must give him a thousand a year. It seems very natural to him, I\r\ndare say, but he might have asked the question before he took a wife\r\nto himself."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t be angry with him, papa!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s no good being angry. No;--I\'m not angry. Only it seems that\r\neverybody is uncommonly well pleased without thinking who has to pay\r\nfor the piper."\r\n\r\nOn that evening, at Wharton, Emily still wore her mourning dress. No\r\none, indeed, dared to speak to her on the subject, and Mary was even\r\nafraid lest she might appear in black on the following day. We all\r\nknow in what condition is a house on the eve of a marriage,--how\r\nthe bride feels that all the world is going to be changed, and that\r\ntherefore everything is for the moment disjointed; and how the rest\r\nof the household, including the servants, are led to share the\r\nfeeling. Everett was of course away. He was over at Longbarns with\r\nthe Fletchers, and was to be brought to Wharton Church on the\r\nfollowing morning. Old Mrs. Fletcher was at Wharton Hall,--and the\r\nbishop, whose services had been happily secured. He was formally\r\nintroduced to Mrs. Lopez, the use of the name for the occasion being\r\nabsolutely necessary, and with all the smiling urbanity which as a\r\nbishop he was bound to possess, he was hardly able not to be funereal\r\nas he looked at her and remembered her story. Before the evening was\r\nover Mrs. Fletcher did venture to give a hint. "We are so glad you\r\nhave come, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I could not stay away when Everett said he wished it."\r\n\r\n"It would have been wrong; yes, my dear,--wrong. It is your duty, and\r\nthe duty of us all, to subordinate our feelings to those of others.\r\nEven sorrow may be selfish." Poor Emily listened but could make no\r\nreply. "It is sometimes harder for us to be mindful of others in our\r\ngrief than in our joy. You should remember, dear, that there are some\r\nwho will never be light-hearted again till they see you smile."\r\n\r\n"Do not say that, Mrs. Fletcher."\r\n\r\n"It is quite true;--and right that you should think of it. It will\r\nbe particularly necessary that you should think of it to-morrow. You\r\nwill have to wear a light dress, and--"\r\n\r\n"I have come provided," said the widow.\r\n\r\n"Try then to make your heart as light as your frock. You will be\r\ndoing it for Everett\'s sake, and for your father\'s, and for Mary\'s\r\nsake--and Arthur\'s. You will be doing it for the sake of all of us on\r\na day that should be joyous." She could not make any promise in reply\r\nto this homily, but in her heart of hearts she acknowledged that it\r\nwas true, and declared to herself that she would make the effort\r\nrequired of her.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the house was of course in confusion. There\r\nwas to be a breakfast after the service, and after the breakfast the\r\nbride was to be taken away in a carriage and four as far as Hereford\r\non her route to Paris;--but before the great breakfast there was\r\nof course a subsidiary breakfast,--or how could bishop, bride, or\r\nbridesmaids have sustained the ceremony? At this meal Emily did not\r\nappear, having begged for a cup of tea in her own room. The carriages\r\nto take the party to the church, which was but the other side of the\r\npark, were ordered at eleven, and at a quarter before eleven she\r\nappeared for the first time in her grey silk dress, and without a\r\nwidow\'s cap. Everything was very plain, but the alteration was so\r\ngreat that it was impossible not to look at her. Even her father\r\nhad not seen the change before. Not a word was said, though old Mrs.\r\nFletcher\'s thanks were implied by the graciousness of her smile. As\r\nthere were four bridesmaids and four other ladies besides the bride\r\nherself, in a few minutes she became obscured by the brightness of\r\nthe others;--and then they were all packed in their carriages and\r\ntaken to the church. The eyes which she most dreaded did not meet\r\nhers till they were all standing round the altar. It was only then\r\nthat she saw Arthur Fletcher, who was there as her brother\'s best\r\nman, and it was then that he took her hand and held it for half a\r\nminute as though he never meant to part with it, hidden behind the\r\nwide-spread glories of the bridesmaids\' finery.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was as sweet and solemn as a kind-hearted bishop could\r\nmake it, and all the ladies looked particularly well. The veil from\r\nLondon,--with the orange wreath, also metropolitan,--was perfect, and\r\nas for the dress, I doubt whether any woman would have known it to be\r\nprovincial. Everett looked the rising baronet, every inch of him, and\r\nthe old barrister smiled and seemed, at least, to be well pleased.\r\nThen came the breakfast, and the speech-making, in which Arthur\r\nFletcher shone triumphantly. It was a very nice wedding, and Mary\r\nWharton,--as she had been and still was,--felt herself for a moment\r\nto be a heroine. But, through it all, there was present to the hearts\r\nof most of them a feeling that much more was to be effected, if\r\npossible, than this simple and cosy marriage, and that the fate of\r\nMary Wharton was hardly so important to them as that of Emily Lopez.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage and four was gone there came upon the household the\r\ndifficulty usual on such occasions of getting through the rest of the\r\nday. The bridesmaids retired and repacked their splendours so that\r\nthey might come out fresh for other second-rate needs, and with the\r\nbridesmaids went the widow. Arthur Fletcher remained at Wharton with\r\nall the other Fletchers for the night, and was prepared to renew his\r\nsuit on that very day, if an opportunity were given him; but Emily\r\ndid not again show herself till a few minutes before dinner, and\r\nthen she came down with all the appurtenances of mourning which she\r\nusually wore. The grey silk had been put on for the marriage ceremony\r\nand for that only. "You should have kept your dress at any rate for\r\nthe day," said Mrs. Fletcher. She replied that she had changed it for\r\nEverett, and that as Everett was gone there was no further need for\r\nher to wear clothes unfitted to her position. Arthur would have cared\r\nvery little for the clothes could he have had his way with the woman\r\nwho wore them,--could he have had his way even so far as to have\r\nfound himself alone with her for half-an-hour. But no such chance was\r\nhis. She retreated from the party early, and did not show herself on\r\nthe following morning till after he had started for Longbarns.\r\n\r\nAll the Fletchers went back,--not, however, with any intention on the\r\npart of Arthur to abandon his immediate attempt. The distance between\r\nthe houses was not so great but that he could drive himself over at\r\nany time. "I shall go now," he said to Mr. Wharton, "because I have\r\npromised John to fish with him to-morrow, but I shall come over\r\non Monday or Tuesday, and stay till I go back to town. I hope she\r\nwill at any rate let me speak to her." The father said he would do\r\nhis best, but that that obstinate resumption of her weeds on her\r\nbrother\'s very wedding day had nearly broken his heart.\r\n\r\nWhen the Fletchers were back at Longbarns, the two ladies were very\r\nsevere on her. "It was downright obstinacy," said the squire\'s wife,\r\n"and it almost makes me think it would serve her right to leave her\r\nas she is."\r\n\r\n"It\'s pride," said the old lady. "She won\'t give way. I said ever so\r\nmuch to her,--but it\'s no use. I feel it the more because we have all\r\ngone so much out of the way to be good to her after she had made such\r\na fool of herself. If it goes on much longer, I shall never forgive\r\nher again."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to forgive her, mother," said her eldest son, "let her\r\nsins be what they may,--or else you\'ll have to quarrel with Arthur."\r\n\r\n"I do think it\'s very hard," said the old lady, taking herself out of\r\nthe room. And it was hard. The offence in the first instance had been\r\nvery great, and the forgiveness very difficult. But Mrs. Fletcher had\r\nlived long enough to know that when sons are thoroughly respectable a\r\nwidowed mother has to do their bidding.\r\n\r\nEmily, through the whole wedding day, and the next day, and day after\r\nday, remembered Mrs. Fletcher\'s words. "There are some who will\r\nnever be light-hearted again till they see you smile." And the old\r\nwoman had named her dearest friends, and had ended by naming Arthur\r\nFletcher. She had then acknowledged to herself that it was her duty\r\nto smile in order that others might smile also. But how is one to\r\nsmile with a heavy heart? Should one smile and lie? And how long and\r\nto what good purpose can such forced contentment last? She had marred\r\nher whole life. In former days she had been proud of all her virgin\r\nglories,--proud of her intellect, proud of her beauty, proud of that\r\nobeisance which beauty, birth, and intellect combined, exact from all\r\ncomers. She had been ambitious as to her future life;--had intended\r\nto be careful not to surrender herself to some empty fool;--had\r\nthought herself well qualified to pick her own steps. And this had\r\ncome of it! They told her that she might still make everything right,\r\nannul the past and begin the world again as fresh as ever,--if she\r\nwould only smile and study to forget! Do it for the sake of others,\r\nthey said, and then it will be done for yourself also. But she could\r\nnot conquer the past. The fire and water of repentance, adequate as\r\nthey may be for eternity, cannot burn out or wash away the remorse\r\nof this life. They scorch and choke;--and unless it be so there is\r\nno repentance. So she told herself,--and yet it was her duty to be\r\nlight-hearted that others around her might not be made miserable by\r\nher sorrow! If she could be in truth light-hearted, then would she\r\nknow herself to be unfeeling and worthless.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the marriage Arthur Fletcher came back to\r\nWharton with the declared intention of remaining there till the end\r\nof the holidays. She could make no objection to such an arrangement,\r\nnor could she hasten her own return to London. That had been fixed\r\nbefore her departure and was to be made together with her father.\r\nShe felt that she was being attacked with unfair weapons, and that\r\nundue advantage was taken of the sacrifice which she had made for\r\nher brother\'s sake. And yet,--yet how good to her they all were!\r\nHow wonderful was it that after the thing she had done, after the\r\ndisgrace she had brought on herself and them, after the destruction\r\nof all that pride which had once been hers, they should still\r\nwish to have her among them! As for him,--of whom she was always\r\nthinking,--of what nature must be his love, when he was willing to\r\ntake to himself as his wife such a thing as she had made herself!\r\nBut, thinking of this, she would only tell herself that as he would\r\nnot protect himself, she was bound to be his protector. Yes;--she\r\nwould protect him, though she could dream of a world of joy that\r\nmight be hers if she could dare to do as he would ask her.\r\n\r\nHe caught her at last and forced her to come out with him into the\r\ngrounds. He could tell his tale better as he walked by her side than\r\nsitting restlessly on a chair or moving awkwardly about the room\r\nas on such an occasion he would be sure to do. Within four walls\r\nshe would have some advantage over him. She could sit still and be\r\ndignified in her stillness. But in the open air, when they would\r\nboth be on their legs, she might not be so powerful with him, and he\r\nperhaps might be stronger with her. She could not refuse him when he\r\nasked her to walk with him. And why should she refuse him? Of course\r\nhe must be allowed to utter his prayer,--and then she must be allowed\r\nto make her answer. "I think the marriage went off very well," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Very well. Everett ought to be a happy man."\r\n\r\n"No doubt he will be,--when he settles down to something. Everything\r\nwill come right for him. With some people things seem to go smooth;\r\ndon\'t they? They have not hitherto gone smoothly with you and me,\r\nEmily."\r\n\r\n"You are prosperous. You have everything before you that a man can\r\nwish, if only you will allow yourself to think so. Your profession is\r\nsuccessful, and you are in Parliament, and everyone likes you."\r\n\r\n"It is all nothing."\r\n\r\n"That is the general discontent of the world."\r\n\r\n"It is all nothing,--unless I have you too. Remember that I had said\r\nso long before I was successful, when I did not dream of Parliament;\r\nbefore we had heard of the name of the man who came between me and\r\nmy happiness. I think I am entitled to be believed when I say so.\r\nI think I know my own mind. There are many men who would have been\r\nchanged by the episode of such a marriage."\r\n\r\n"You ought to have been changed by it,--and by its result."\r\n\r\n"It had no such effect. Here I am, after it all, telling you as\r\nI used to tell you before, that I have to look to you for my\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\n"You should be ashamed to confess it, Arthur."\r\n\r\n"Never;--not to you, nor to all the world. I know what it has been.\r\nI know you are not now as you were then. You have been his wife, and\r\nare now his widow."\r\n\r\n"That should be enough."\r\n\r\n"But, such as you are, my happiness is in your hands. If it were not\r\nso, do you think that all my family as well as yours would join in\r\nwishing that you may become my wife? There is nothing to conceal.\r\nWhen you married that man you know what my mother thought of it;\r\nand what John thought of it, and his wife. They had wanted you to\r\nbe my wife; and they want it now,--because they are anxious for\r\nmy happiness. And your father wishes it, and your brother wishes\r\nit,--because they trust me, and think that I should be a good husband\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"Good!" she exclaimed, hardly knowing what she meant by repeating the\r\nword.\r\n\r\n"After that you have no right to set yourself up to judge what may\r\nbe best for my happiness. They who know how to judge are all united.\r\nWhatever you may have been, they believe that it will be good for me\r\nthat you should now be my wife. After that you must talk about me no\r\nlonger, unless you will talk of my wishes."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I am not anxious for your happiness?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know;--but I shall find out in time. That is what I have to\r\nsay about myself. And as to you, is it not much the same? I know you\r\nlove me. Whatever the feeling was that overcame you as to that other\r\nman,--it has gone. I cannot now stop to be tender and soft in my\r\nwords. The thing to be said is too serious to me. And every friend\r\nyou have wants you to marry the man you love and to put an end to the\r\ndesolation which you have brought on yourself. There is not one among\r\nus all, Fletchers and Whartons, whose comfort does not more or less\r\ndepend on your sacrificing the luxury of your own woe."\r\n\r\n"Luxury!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; luxury. No man ever had a right to say more positively to a\r\nwoman that it was her duty to marry him, than I have to you. And I\r\ndo say it. I say it on behalf of all of us, that it is your duty. I\r\nwon\'t talk of my own love now, because you know it. You cannot doubt\r\nit. I won\'t even talk of yours, because I am sure of it. But I say\r\nthat it is your duty to give up drowning us all in tears, burying us\r\nin desolation. You are one of us, and should do as all of us wish\r\nyou. If, indeed, you could not love me it would be different. There!\r\nI have said what I\'ve got to say. You are crying, and I will not take\r\nyour answer now. I will come to you again to-morrow, and then you\r\nshall answer me. But, remember when you do so that the happiness of\r\nmany people depends on what you say." Then he left her very suddenly\r\nand hurried back to the house by himself.\r\n\r\nHe had been very rough with her,--had not once attempted to touch her\r\nhand or even her arm, had spoken no soft word to her, speaking of\r\nhis own love as a thing too certain to need further words; and he\r\nhad declared himself to be so assured of her love that there was no\r\nfavour for him now to ask, nothing for which he was bound to pray as\r\na lover. All that was past. He had simply declared it to be her duty\r\nto marry him, and had told her so with much sternness. He had walked\r\nfast, compelling her to accompany him, had frowned at her, and had\r\nmore than once stamped his foot upon the ground. During the whole\r\ninterview she had been so near to weeping that she could hardly\r\nspeak. Once or twice she had almost thought him to be cruel;--but he\r\nhad forced her to acknowledge to herself that all that he had said\r\nwas true and unanswerable. Had he pressed her for an answer at the\r\nmoment she would not have known in what words to couch a refusal. And\r\nyet as she made her way alone back to the house she assured herself\r\nthat she would have refused.\r\n\r\nHe had given her four-and-twenty hours, and at the end of that time\r\nshe would be bound to give him her answer,--an answer which must then\r\nbe final. And as she said this to herself she found that she was\r\nadmitting a doubt. She hardly knew how not to doubt, knowing, as she\r\ndid, that all whom she loved were on one side, while on the other\r\nwas nothing but the stubbornness of her own convictions. But still\r\nthe conviction was left to her. Over and over again she declared to\r\nherself that it was not fit, meaning thereby to assure herself that\r\na higher duty even than that which she owed to her friends, demanded\r\nfrom her that she should be true to her convictions. She met him that\r\nday at dinner, but he hardly spoke to her. They sat together in the\r\nsame room during the evening, but she hardly once heard his voice.\r\nIt seemed to her that he avoided even looking at her. When they\r\nseparated for the night he parted from her almost as though they\r\nhad been strangers. Surely he was angry with her because she was\r\nstubborn,--thought evil of her because she would not do as others\r\nwished her! She lay awake during the long night thinking of it all.\r\nIf it might be so! Oh;--if it might be so! If it might be done\r\nwithout utter ruin to her own self-respect as a woman!\r\n\r\nIn the morning she was down early,--not having anything to say,\r\nwith no clear purpose as yet before her,--but still with a feeling\r\nthat perhaps that morning might alter all things for her. He was\r\nthe latest of the party, not coming in for prayers as did all the\r\nothers, but taking his seat when the others had half finished their\r\nbreakfast. As he sat down he gave a general half-uttered greeting to\r\nthem all, but spoke no special word to any of them. It chanced that\r\nhis seat was next to hers, but to her he did not address himself at\r\nall. Then the meal was over, and the chairs were withdrawn, and the\r\nparty grouped itself about with vague, uncertain movements, as men\r\nand women do before they leave the breakfast table for the work of\r\nthe day. She meditated her escape, but felt that she could not leave\r\nthe room before Lady Wharton or Mrs. Fletcher,--who had remained\r\nat Wharton to keep her mother company for a while. At last they\r\nwent;--but then, just as she was escaping, he put his hand upon her\r\nand reminded her of her appointment. "I shall be in the hall in a\r\nquarter of an hour," he said. "Will you meet me there?" Then she\r\nbowed her head to him and passed on.\r\n\r\nShe was there at the time named and found him standing by the hall\r\ndoor, waiting for her. His hat was already on his head and his back\r\nwas almost turned to her. He opened the door, and, allowing her to\r\npass out first, led the way to the shrubbery. He did not speak to her\r\ntill he had closed behind her the little iron gate which separated\r\nthe walk from the garden, and then he turned upon her with one word.\r\n"Well?" he said. She was silent for a moment, and then he repeated\r\nhis eager question: "Well;--well?"\r\n\r\n"I should disgrace you," she said, not firmly as before, but\r\nwhispering the words.\r\n\r\nHe waited for no other assent. The form of the words told him that he\r\nhad won the day. In a moment his arms were round her, and her veil\r\nwas off, and his lips were pressed to hers;--and when she could see\r\nhis countenance the whole form of his face was altered to her. It was\r\nbright as it used to be bright in old days, and he was smiling on her\r\nas he used to smile. "My own," he said;--"my wife--my own!" And she\r\nhad no longer the power to deny him. "Not yet, Arthur; not yet," was\r\nall that she could say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX\r\n\r\nThe Last Meeting at Matching\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ex-Prime Minister did not carry out his purpose of leaving London\r\nin the middle of the season and travelling either to Italy or Norway.\r\nHe was away from London at Whitsuntide longer perhaps than he might\r\nhave been if still in office, and during this period regarded himself\r\nas a man from whose hands all work had been taken,--as one who had\r\nbeen found unfit to carry any longer a burden serviceably; but before\r\nJune was over he and the Duchess were back in London, and gradually\r\nhe allowed himself to open his mouth on this or that subject in the\r\nHouse of Lords,--not pitching into everybody all round, as his wife\r\nhad recommended, but expressing an opinion now and again, generally\r\nin support of his friends, with the dignity which should belong to a\r\nretired Prime Minister. The Duchess too recovered much of her good\r\ntemper,--as far at least as the outward show went. One or two who\r\nknew her, especially Mrs. Finn, were aware that her hatred and her\r\nideas of revenge were not laid aside; but she went on from day to day\r\nanathematizing her special enemies and abstained from reproaching\r\nher husband for his pusillanimity. Then came the question as to\r\nthe autumn. "Let\'s have everybody down at Gatherum, just as we had\r\nbefore," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\nThe proposition almost took away the Duke\'s breath. "Why do you want\r\na crowd, like that?"\r\n\r\n"Just to show them that we are not beaten because we are turned out."\r\n\r\n"But, inasmuch as we were turned out, we were beaten. And what has\r\na gathering of people at my private house to do with a political\r\nmanoeuvre? Do you especially want to go to Gatherum?"\r\n\r\n"I hate the place. You know I do."\r\n\r\n"Then why should you propose to go there?" He hardly yet knew his\r\nwife well enough to understand that the suggestion had been a joke.\r\n"If you don\'t wish to go abroad--"\r\n\r\n"I hate going abroad."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll remain at Matching. You don\'t hate Matching."\r\n\r\n"Ah dear! There are memories there too. But you like it."\r\n\r\n"My books are there."\r\n\r\n"Blue-books," said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n"And there is plenty of room if you wish to have friends."\r\n\r\n"I suppose we must have somebody. You can\'t live without your\r\nMentor."\r\n\r\n"You can ask whom you please," he said almost fretfully.\r\n\r\n"Lady Rosina, of course," suggested the Duchess. Then he turned to\r\nthe papers before him and wouldn\'t say another word. The matter ended\r\nin a party much as usual being collected at Matching about the middle\r\nof October,--Telemachus having spent the early part of the autumn\r\nwith Mentor at Long Royston. There might perhaps be a dozen guests\r\nin the house, and among them of course were Phineas Finn and his\r\nwife. And Mr. Grey was there, having come back from his eastern\r\nmission,--whose unfortunate abandonment of his seat at Silverbridge\r\nhad caused so many troubles,--and Mrs. Grey, who in days now long\r\npassed had been almost as necessary to Lady Glencora as was now her\r\nlater friend Mrs. Finn,--and the Cantrips, and for a short time the\r\nSt. Bungays. But Lady Rosina De Courcy on this occasion was not\r\npresent. There were few there whom my patient readers have not seen\r\nat Matching before; but among those few was Arthur Fletcher.\r\n\r\n"So it is to be," said the Duchess to the member for Silverbridge one\r\nmorning. She had by this time become intimate with "her member," as\r\nshe would sometimes call him in joke, and had concerned herself much\r\nas to his matrimonial prospects.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Duchess; it is to be,--unless some unforeseen circumstance\r\nshould arise."\r\n\r\n"What circumstance?"\r\n\r\n"Ladies and gentlemen sometimes do change their minds;--but in this\r\ncase I do not think it likely."\r\n\r\n"And why ain\'t you being married now, Mr. Fletcher?"\r\n\r\n"We have agreed to postpone it till next year;--so that we may be\r\nquite sure of our own minds."\r\n\r\n"I know you are laughing at me; but nevertheless I am very glad that\r\nit is settled. Pray tell her from me that I shall call again as soon\r\nas ever she is Mrs. Fletcher, though I don\'t think she repaid either\r\nof the last two visits I made her."\r\n\r\n"You must make excuses for her, Duchess."\r\n\r\n"Of course. I know. After all she is a most fortunate woman. And as\r\nfor you,--I regard you as a hero among lovers."\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting used to it," she said one day to Mrs. Finn.\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'ll get used to it. We get used to anything that chance\r\nsends us in a marvellously short time."\r\n\r\n"What I mean is that I can go to bed, and sleep, and get up and eat\r\nmy meals without missing the sound of the trumpets so much as I did\r\nat first. I remember hearing of people who lived in a mill, and\r\ncouldn\'t sleep when the mill stopped. It was like that with me when\r\nour mill stopped at first. I had got myself so used to the excitement\r\nof it, that I could hardly live without it."\r\n\r\n"You might have all the excitement still, if you pleased. You need\r\nnot be dead to politics because your husband is not Prime Minister."\r\n\r\n"No; never again,--unless he should come back. If any one had told me\r\nten years ago that I should have taken an interest in this or that\r\nman being in the Government, I should have laughed him to scorn. It\r\ndid not seem possible to me then that I should care what became of\r\nsuch men as Sir Timothy Beeswax and Mr. Roby. But I did get to be\r\nanxious about it when Plantagenet was shifted from one office to\r\nanother."\r\n\r\n"Of course you did. Do you think I am not anxious about Phineas?"\r\n\r\n"But when he became Prime Minister, I gave myself up to it\r\naltogether. I shall never forget what I felt when he came to me and\r\ntold me that perhaps it might be so;--but told me also that he would\r\nescape from it if it were possible. I was the Lady Macbeth of the\r\noccasion all over;--whereas he was so scrupulous, so burdened with\r\nconscience! As for me, I would have taken it by any means. Then it\r\nwas that the old Duke played the part of the three witches to a\r\nnicety. Well, there hasn\'t been any absolute murder, and I haven\'t\r\nquite gone mad."\r\n\r\n"Nor need you be afraid, though all the woods of Gatherum should come\r\nto Matching."\r\n\r\n"God forbid! I will never see anything of Gatherum again. What annoys\r\nme most is, and always was, that he wouldn\'t understand what I felt\r\nabout it;--how proud I was that he should be Prime Minister, how\r\nanxious that he should be great and noble in his office;--how I\r\nworked for him, and not at all for any pleasure of my own."\r\n\r\n"I think he did feel it."\r\n\r\n"No;--not as I did. At last he liked the power,--or rather feared the\r\ndisgrace of losing it. But he had no idea of the personal grandeur of\r\nthe place. He never understood that to be Prime Minister in England\r\nis as much as to be an Emperor in France, and much more than being\r\nPresident in America. Oh, how I did labour for him,--and how he did\r\nscold me for it with those quiet little stinging words of his! I was\r\nvulgar!"\r\n\r\n"Is that a quiet word?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--as he used it;--and indiscreet, and ignorant, and stupid. I\r\nbore it all, though sometimes I was dying with vexation. Now it\'s all\r\nover, and here we are as humdrum as any one else. And the Beeswaxes,\r\nand the Robys, and the Droughts, and the Pountneys, and the Lopezes,\r\nhave all passed over the scene! Do you remember that Pountney affair,\r\nand how he turned the poor man out of the house?"\r\n\r\n"It served him right."\r\n\r\n"It would have served them all right to be turned out,--only they\r\nwere there for a purpose. I did like it in a way, and it makes me sad\r\nto think that the feeling can never come again. Even if they should\r\nhave him back again, it would be a very lame affair to me then. I can\r\nnever again rouse myself to the effort of preparing food and lodging\r\nfor half the Parliament and their wives. I shall never again think\r\nthat I can help to rule England by coaxing unpleasant men. It is done\r\nand gone, and can never come back again."\r\n\r\nNot long after this the Duke took Mr. Monk, who had come down to\r\nMatching for a few days, out to the very spot on which he had sat\r\nwhen he indulged himself in lecturing Phineas Finn on Conservatism\r\nand Liberalism generally, and then asked the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer what he thought of the present state of public affairs. He\r\nhimself had supported Mr. Gresham\'s government, and did not belong\r\nto it because he could not at present reconcile himself to filling\r\nany office. Mr. Monk did not scruple to say that in his opinion\r\nthe present legitimate division of parties was preferable to\r\nthe Coalition which had existed for three years. "In such an\r\narrangement," said Mr. Monk, "there must always be a certain amount\r\nof distrust, and such a feeling is fatal to any great work."\r\n\r\n"I think I distrusted no one till separation came,--and when it did\r\ncome it was not caused by me."\r\n\r\n"I am not blaming any one now," said the other; "but men who have\r\nbeen brought up with opinions altogether different, even with\r\ndifferent instincts as to politics, who from their mother\'s milk have\r\nbeen nourished on codes of thought altogether opposed to each other,\r\ncannot work together with confidence even though they may desire the\r\nsame thing. The very ideas which are sweet as honey to the one are\r\nbitter as gall to the other."\r\n\r\n"You think, then, that we made a great mistake?"\r\n\r\n"I will not say that," said Mr. Monk. "There was a difficulty at the\r\ntime, and that difficulty was overcome. The Government was carried\r\non, and was on the whole respected. History will give you credit for\r\npatriotism, patience, and courage. No man could have done it better\r\nthan you did;--probably no other man of the day so well."\r\n\r\n"But it was not a great part to play?" The Duke in his nervousness,\r\nas he said this, could not avoid the use of that questioning tone\r\nwhich requires an answer.\r\n\r\n"Great enough to satisfy the heart of a man who has fortified himself\r\nagainst the evil side of ambition. After all, what is it that the\r\nPrime Minister of such a country as this should chiefly regard? Is it\r\nnot the prosperity of the country? It is not often that we want great\r\nmeasures, or new arrangements that shall be vital to the country.\r\nPoliticians now look for grievances, not because the grievances are\r\nheavy, but trusting that the honour of abolishing them may be great.\r\nIt is the old story of the needy knife-grinder who, if left to\r\nhimself, would have no grievance of which to complain."\r\n\r\n"But there are grievances," said the Duke. "Look at monetary\r\ndenominations. Look at our weights and measures."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes. I will not say that everything has as yet been reduced to\r\ndivine order. But when we took office three years ago we certainly\r\ndid not intend to settle those difficulties."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said the Duke, sadly.\r\n\r\n"But we did do all that we meant to do. For my own part, there is\r\nonly one thing in it that I regret, and one only which you should\r\nregret also till you have resolved to remedy it."\r\n\r\n"What thing is that?"\r\n\r\n"Your own retirement from official life. If the country is to lose\r\nyour services for the long course of years during which you will\r\nprobably sit in Parliament, then I shall think that the country has\r\nlost more than it has gained by the Coalition."\r\n\r\nThe Duke sat for a while silent, looking at the view, and, before\r\nanswering Mr. Monk,--while arranging his answer,--once or twice in a\r\nhalf-absent way, called his companion\'s attention to the scene before\r\nhim. But during this time he was going through an act of painful\r\nrepentance. He was condemning himself for a word or two that had been\r\nill-spoken by himself, and which, since the moment of its utterance,\r\nhe had never ceased to remember with shame. He told himself now,\r\nafter his own secret fashion, that he must do penance for these words\r\nby the humiliation of a direct contradiction of them. He must declare\r\nthat Caesar would at some future time be prepared to serve under\r\nPompey. Then he made his answer. "Mr. Monk," he said, "I should be\r\nfalse if I were to deny that it pleases me to hear you say so. I have\r\nthought much of all that for the last two or three months. You may\r\nprobably have seen that I am not a man endowed with that fortitude\r\nwhich enables many to bear vexations with an easy spirit. I am given\r\nto fretting, and I am inclined to think that a popular minister in\r\na free country should be so constituted as to be free from that\r\ninfirmity. I shall certainly never desire to be at the head of a\r\nGovernment again. For a few years I would prefer to remain out of\r\noffice. But I will endeavour to look forward to a time when I may\r\nagain perhaps be of some humble use."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PRIME MINISTER***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 2158.txt or 2158.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/1/5/2158\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
