Gerbois, professor of\r\nmathematics at the College of Versailles, while rummaging in an old\r\ncuriosity-shop, unearthed a small mahogany writing-desk which pleased\r\nhim very much on account of the multiplicity of its drawers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the thing for Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s birthday present,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. And as he\r\nalways tried to furnish some simple pleasures for his daughter,\r\nconsistent with his modest income, he enquired the price, and, after\r\nsome keen bargaining, purchased it for sixty-five francs. As he was\r\ngiving his address to the shopkeeper, a young man, dressed with\r\nelegance and taste, who had been exploring the stock of antiques,\r\ncaught sight of the writing-desk, and immediately enquired its price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is sold,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the shopkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! to this gentleman, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Gerbois bowed, and left the store, quite proud to be the\r\npossessor of an article which had attracted the attention of a\r\ngentleman of quality. But he had not taken a dozen steps in the street,\r\nwhen he was overtaken by the young man who, hat in hand and in a tone\r\nof perfect courtesy, thus addressed him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, monsieur; I am going to ask you a question that you\r\nmay deem impertinent. It is this: Did you have any special object in\r\nview when you bought that writing-desk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I came across it by chance and it struck my fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you do not care for it particularly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I shall keep it\xe2\x80\x94that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is an antique, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; because it is convenient,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Mon. Gerbois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, you would consent to exchange it for another desk that\r\nwould be quite as convenient and in better condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! this one is in good condition, and I see no object in making an\r\nexchange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Gerbois is a man of irritable disposition and hasty temper. So he\r\nreplied, testily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you, monsieur, do not insist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the young man firmly held his ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much you paid for it, monsieur, but I offer you\r\ndouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree times the amount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that will do,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the professor, impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish\r\nto sell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man stared at him for a moment in a manner that Mon. Gerbois\r\nwould not readily forget, then turned and walked rapidly away.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the desk was delivered at the professor\xe2\x80\x99s house on the\r\nViroflay road. He called his daughter, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is something for you, Suzanne, provided you like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuzanne was a pretty girl, with a gay and affectionate nature. She\r\nthrew her arms around her father\xe2\x80\x99s neck and kissed him rapturously. To\r\nher, the desk had all the semblance of a royal gift. That evening,\r\nassisted by Hortense, the servant, she placed the desk in her room;\r\nthen she dusted it, cleaned the drawers and pigeon-holes, and carefully\r\narranged within it her papers, writing material, correspondence, a\r\ncollection of post-cards, and some souvenirs of her cousin Philippe\r\nthat she kept in secret.\r\n\r\nNext morning, at half past seven, Mon. Gerbois went to the college. At\r\nten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in pursuance of her usual custom, Suzanne went to meet\r\nhim, and it was a great pleasure for him to see her slender figure and\r\nchildish smile waiting for him at the college gate. They returned home\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your writing desk\xe2\x80\x94how is it this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvellous! Hortense and I have polished the brass mountings until\r\nthey look like gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are pleased with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleased with it! Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I managed to get on without it\r\nfor such a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they were walking up the pathway to the house, Mon. Gerbois said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go and take a look at it before breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s a splendid idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ascended the stairs ahead of her father, but, on arriving at the\r\ndoor of her room, she uttered a cry of surprise and dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Mon. Gerbois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe writing-desk is gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the police were called in, they were astonished at the admirable\r\nsimplicity of the means employed by the thief. During Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence, the servant had gone to market, and while the house was thus\r\nleft unguarded, a drayman, wearing a badge\xe2\x80\x94some of the neighbors saw\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94stopped his cart in front of the house and rang twice. Not knowing\r\nthat Hortense was absent, the neighbors were not suspicious;\r\nconsequently, the man carried on his work in peace and tranquility.\r\n\r\nApart from the desk, not a thing in the house had been disturbed. Even\r\nSuzanne\xe2\x80\x99s purse, which she had left upon the writing-desk, was found\r\nupon an adjacent table with its contents untouched. It was obvious that\r\nthe thief had come with a set purpose, which rendered the crime even\r\nmore mysterious; because, why did he assume so great a risk for such a\r\ntrifling object?\r\n\r\nThe only clue the professor could furnish was the strange incident of\r\nthe preceding evening. He declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young man was greatly provoked at my refusal, and I had an idea\r\nthat he threatened me as he went away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the clue was a vague one. The shopkeeper could not throw any light\r\non the affair. He did not know either of the gentlemen. As to the desk\r\nitself, he had purchased it for forty francs at an executor\xe2\x80\x99s sale at\r\nChevreuse, and believed he had resold it at its fair value. The police\r\ninvestigation disclosed nothing more.\r\n\r\nBut Mon. Gerbois entertained the idea that he had suffered an enormous\r\nloss. There must have been a fortune concealed in a secret drawer, and\r\nthat was the reason the young man had resorted to crime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor father, what would we have done with that fortune?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nSuzanne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child! with such a fortune, you could make a most advantageous\r\nmarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuzanne sighed bitterly. Her aspirations soared no higher than her\r\ncousin Philippe, who was indeed a most deplorable object. And life, in\r\nthe little house at Versailles, was not so happy and contented as of\r\nyore.\r\n\r\nTwo months passed away. Then came a succession of startling events, a\r\nstrange blending of good luck and dire misfortune!\r\n\r\nOn the first day of February, at half-past five, Mon. Gerbois entered\r\nthe house, carrying an evening paper, took a seat, put on his\r\nspectacles, and commenced to read. As politics did not interest him, he\r\nturned to the inside of the paper. Immediately his attention was\r\nattracted by an article entitled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThird Drawing of the Press Association Lottery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. 514, series 23, draws a million.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe newspaper slipped from his fingers. The walls swam before his eyes,\r\nand his heart ceased to beat. He held No. 514, series 23. He had\r\npurchased it from a friend, to oblige him, without any thought of\r\nsuccess, and behold, it was the lucky number!\r\n\r\nQuickly, he took out his memorandum-book. Yes, he was quite right. The\r\nNo. 514, series 23, was written there, on the inside of the cover. But\r\nthe ticket?\r\n\r\nHe rushed to his desk to find the envelope-box in which he had placed\r\nthe precious ticket; but the box was not there, and it suddenly\r\noccurred to him that it had not been there for several weeks. He heard\r\nfootsteps on the gravel walk leading from the street.\r\n\r\nHe called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuzanne! Suzanne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was returning from a walk. She entered hastily. He stammered, in a\r\nchoking voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuzanne ... the box ... the box of envelopes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one I bought at the Louvre ... one Saturday ... it was at the end\r\nof that table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember, father, we put all those things away together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe evening ... you know ... the same evening....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where?... Tell me, quick!... Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Why, in the writing-desk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the writing-desk that was stolen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mon Dieu!... In the stolen desk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe uttered the last sentence in a low voice, in a sort of stupor. Then\r\nhe seized her hand, and in a still lower voice, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt contained a million, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! father, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, naively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA million!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt contained the ticket that drew the grand\r\nprize in the Press Lottery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colossal proportions of the disaster overwhelmed them, and for a\r\nlong time they maintained a silence that they feared to break. At last,\r\nSuzanne said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, father, they will pay you just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? On what proof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you have proof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you haven\xe2\x80\x99t any?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was in the box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the box that has disappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and now the thief will get the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that would be terrible, father. You must prevent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was silent; then, in an outburst of energy, he leaped\r\nup, stamped on the floor, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, he shall not have that million; he shall not have it! Why\r\nshould he have it? Ah! clever as he is, he can do nothing. If he goes\r\nto claim the money, they will arrest him. Ah! now, we will see, my fine\r\nfellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do, father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefend our just rights, whatever happens! And we will succeed. The\r\nmillion francs belong to me, and I intend to have them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, he sent this telegram:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGovernor Cr\xc3\xa9dit Foncier\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crue Capucines, Paris.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAm holder of No. 514, series 23. Oppose by all legal means any\r\n    other claimant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGERBOIS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment, the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Foncier received the following\r\ntelegram:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. 514, series 23, is in my possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery time I undertake to relate one of the many extraordinary\r\nadventures that mark the life of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, I experience a feeling\r\nof embarrassment, as it seems to me that the most commonplace of those\r\nadventures is already well known to my readers. In fact, there is not a\r\nmovement of our \xe2\x80\x9cnational thief,\xe2\x80\x9d as he has been so aptly described,\r\nthat has not been given the widest publicity, not an exploit that has\r\nnot been studied in all its phases, not an action that has not been\r\ndiscussed with that particularity usually reserved for the recital of\r\nheroic deeds.\r\n\r\nFor instance, who does not know the strange history of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Blonde\r\nLady,\xe2\x80\x9d with those curious episodes which were proclaimed by the\r\nnewspapers with heavy black headlines, as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cLottery Ticket No.\r\n514!\xe2\x80\x9d ... \xe2\x80\x9cThe Crime on the Avenue Henri-Martin!\xe2\x80\x9d ... \xe2\x80\x9cThe Blue\r\nDiamond!\xe2\x80\x9d ... The interest created by the intervention of the\r\ncelebrated English detective, Herlock Sholmes! The excitement aroused\r\nby the various vicissitudes which marked the struggle between those\r\nfamous artists! And what a commotion on the boulevards, the day on\r\nwhich the newsboys announced: \xe2\x80\x9cArrest of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy excuse for repeating these stories at this time is the fact that I\r\nproduce the key to the enigma. Those adventures have always been\r\nenveloped in a certain degree of obscurity, which I now remove. I\r\nreproduce old newspaper articles, I relate old-time interviews, I\r\npresent ancient letters; but I have arranged and classified all that\r\nmaterial and reduced it to the exact truth. My collaborators in this\r\nwork have been Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin himself, and also the ineffable Wilson, the\r\nfriend and confidant of Herlock Sholmes.\r\n\r\nEvery one will recall the tremendous burst of laughter which greeted\r\nthe publication of those two telegrams. The name \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x9d was in\r\nitself a stimulus to curiosity, a promise of amusement for the gallery.\r\nAnd, in this case, the gallery means the entire world.\r\n\r\nAn investigation was immediately commenced by the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Foncier, which\r\nestablished these facts: That ticket No. 514, series 23, had been sold\r\nby the Versailles branch office of the Lottery to an artillery officer\r\nnamed Bessy, who was afterward killed by a fall from his horse. Some\r\ntime before his death, he informed some of his comrades that he had\r\ntransferred his ticket to a friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am that friend,\xe2\x80\x9d affirmed Mon. Gerbois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProve it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the governor of the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Foncier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I can prove it. Twenty people can tell you that I was an\r\nintimate friend of Monsieur Bessy, and that we frequently met at the\r\nCaf\xc3\xa9 de la Place-d\xe2\x80\x99Armes. It was there, one day, I purchased the ticket\r\nfrom him for twenty francs\xe2\x80\x94simply as an accommodation to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any witnesses to that transaction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how do you expect to prove it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy a letter he wrote to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter that was pinned to the ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProduce it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was stolen at the same time as the ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was soon learned that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had the letter. A short paragraph\r\nappeared in the _Echo de France_\xe2\x80\x94which has the honor to be his official\r\norgan, and of which, it is said, he is one of the principal\r\nshareholders\xe2\x80\x94the paragraph announced that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had placed in\r\nthe hands of Monsieur Detinan, his advocate and legal adviser, the\r\nletter that Monsieur Bessy had written to him\xe2\x80\x94to him personally.\r\n\r\nThis announcement provoked an outburst of laughter. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had\r\nengaged a lawyer! Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, conforming to the rules and customs of\r\nmodern society, had appointed a legal representative in the person of a\r\nwell-known member of the Parisian bar!\r\n\r\nMon. Detinan had never enjoyed the pleasure of meeting Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfact he deeply regretted\xe2\x80\x94but he had actually been retained by that\r\nmysterious gentleman and felt greatly honored by the choice. He was\r\nprepared to defend the interests of his client to the best of his\r\nability. He was pleased, even proud, to exhibit the letter of Mon.\r\nBessy, but, although it proved the transfer of the ticket, it did not\r\nmention the name of the purchaser. It was simply addressed to \xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear\r\nFriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Friend! that is I,\xe2\x80\x9d added Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, in a note attached to\r\nMon. Bessy\xe2\x80\x99s letter. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the best proof of that fact is that I hold\r\nthe letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe swarm of reporters immediately rushed to see Mon. Gerbois, who\r\ncould only repeat:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Friend! that is I.... Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin stole the letter with the\r\nlottery ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him prove it!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Lupin to the reporters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have done it, because he stole the writing-desk!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nMon. Gerbois before the same reporters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him prove it!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lupin.\r\n\r\nSuch was the entertaining comedy enacted by the two claimants of ticket\r\nNo. 514; and the calm demeanor of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin contrasted strangely\r\nwith the nervous perturbation of poor Mon. Gerbois. The newspapers were\r\nfilled with the lamentations of that unhappy man. He announced his\r\nmisfortune with pathetic candor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand, gentlemen, it was Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s dowry that the rascal stole!\r\nPersonally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a straw for it,... but for Suzanne! Just think\r\nof it, a whole million! Ten times one hundred thousand francs! Ah! I\r\nknew very well that the desk contained a treasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in vain to tell him that his adversary, when stealing the desk,\r\nwas unaware that the lottery ticket was in it, and that, in any event,\r\nhe could not foresee that the ticket would draw the grand prize. He\r\nwould reply;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! of course, he knew it ... else why would he take the trouble\r\nto steal a poor, miserable desk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor some unknown reason; but certainly not for a small scrap of paper\r\nwhich was then worth only twenty francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA million francs! He knew it;... he knows everything! Ah! you do not\r\nknow him\xe2\x80\x94the scoundrel!... He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t robbed you of a million francs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe controversy would have lasted for a much longer time, but, on the\r\ntwelfth day, Mon. Gerbois received from Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin a letter, marked\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cconfidential,\xe2\x80\x9d which read as follows:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, the gallery is being amused at our expense. Do you not\r\n    think it is time for us to be serious? The situation is this: I\r\n    possess a ticket to which I have no legal right, and you have the\r\n    legal right to a ticket you do not possess. Neither of us can do\r\n    anything. You will not relinquish your rights to me; I will not\r\n    deliver the ticket to you. Now, what is to be done?\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI see only one way out of the difficulty: Let us divide the\r\n    spoils. A half-million for you; a half-million for me. Is not that\r\n    a fair division? In my opinion, it is an equitable solution, and an\r\n    immediate one. I will give you three days\xe2\x80\x99 time to consider the\r\n    proposition. On Thursday morning I shall expect to read in the\r\n    personal column of the _Echo de France_ a discreet message\r\n    addressed to _M. Ars. Lup_, expressing in veiled terms your consent\r\n    to my offer. By so doing you will recover immediate possession of\r\n    the ticket; then you can collect the money and send me half a\r\n    million in a manner that I will describe to you later.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIn case of your refusal, I shall resort to other measures to\r\n    accomplish the same result. But, apart from the very serious\r\n    annoyances that such obstinacy on your part will cause you, it will\r\n    cost you twenty-five thousand francs for supplementary expenses.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, monsieur, I remain your devoted servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a fit of exasperation Mon. Gerbois committed the grave mistake of\r\nshowing that letter and allowing a copy of it to be taken. His\r\nindignation overcame his discretion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing! He shall have nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, before a crowd of\r\nreporters. \xe2\x80\x9cTo divide my property with him? Never! Let him tear up the\r\nticket if he wishes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet five hundred thousand francs is better than nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the question. It is a question of my just right, and that\r\nright I will establish before the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! attack Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin? That would be amusing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Foncier. They must pay me the million francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout producing the ticket, or, at least, without proving that you\r\nbought it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat proof exists, since Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin admits that he stole the\r\nwriting-desk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut would the word of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin carry any weight with the court?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter; I will fight it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gallery shouted with glee; and wagers were freely made upon the\r\nresult with the odds in favor of Lupin. On the following Thursday the\r\npersonal column in the _Echo de France_ was eagerly perused by the\r\nexpectant public, but it contained nothing addressed to _M. Ars. Lup_.\r\nMon. Gerbois had not replied to Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s letter. That was the\r\ndeclaration of war.\r\n\r\nThat evening the newspapers announced the abduction of Mlle. Suzanne\r\nGerbois.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most entertaining feature in what might be called the Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\ndramas is the comic attitude displayed by the Parisian police. Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin talks, plans, writes, commands, threatens and executes as if the\r\npolice did not exist. They never figure in his calculations.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the police do their utmost. But what can they do against such a\r\nfoe\xe2\x80\x94a foe that scorns and ignores them?\r\n\r\nSuzanne had left the house at twenty minutes to ten; such was the\r\ntestimony of the servant. On leaving the college, at five minutes past\r\nten, her father did not find her at the place she was accustomed to\r\nwait for him. Consequently, whatever had happened must have occurred\r\nduring the course of Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s walk from the house to the college. Two\r\nneighbors had met her about three hundred yards from the house. A lady\r\nhad seen, on the avenue, a young girl corresponding to Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndescription. No one else had seen her.\r\n\r\nInquiries were made in all directions; the employees of the railways\r\nand street-car lines were questioned, but none of them had seen\r\nanything of the missing girl. However, at Ville-d\xe2\x80\x99Avray, they found a\r\nshopkeeper who had furnished gasoline to an automobile that had come\r\nfrom Paris on the day of the abduction. It was occupied by a blonde\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94extremely blonde, said the witness. An hour later, the automobile\r\nagain passed through Ville-d\xe2\x80\x99Avray on its way from Versailles to Paris.\r\nThe shopkeeper declared that the automobile now contained a second\r\nwoman who was heavily veiled. No doubt, it was Suzanne Gerbois.\r\n\r\nThe abduction must have taken place in broad daylight, on a frequented\r\nstreet, in the very heart of the town. How? And at what spot? Not a cry\r\nwas heard; not a suspicious action had been seen. The shopkeeper\r\ndescribed the automobile as a royal-blue limousine of twenty-four\r\nhorse-power made by the firm of Peugeon & Co. Inquiries were then made\r\nat the Grand-Garage, managed by Madame Bob-Walthour, who made a\r\nspecialty of abductions by automobile. It was learned that she had\r\nrented a Peugeon limousine on that day to a blonde woman whom she had\r\nnever seen before nor since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was the chauffeur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young man named Ernest, whom I had engaged only the day before. He\r\ncame well recommended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he here now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He brought back the machine, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him since,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMadame Bob-Walthour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where we can find him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might see the people who recommended him to me. Here are the\r\nnames.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon inquiry, it was learned that none of these people knew the man\r\ncalled Ernest. The recommendations were forged.\r\n\r\nSuch was the fate of every clue followed by the police. It ended\r\nnowhere. The mystery remained unsolved.\r\n\r\nMon. Gerbois had not the strength or courage to wage such an unequal\r\nbattle. The disappearance of his daughter crushed him; he capitulated\r\nto the enemy. A short announcement in the _Echo de France_ proclaimed\r\nhis unconditional surrender.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Mon. Gerbois visited the office of the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Foncier\r\nand handed lottery ticket number 514, series 23, to the governor, who\r\nexclaimed, with surprise:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you have it! He has returned it to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was mislaid. That was all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mon. Gerbois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you pretended that it had been stolen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first, I thought it had ... but here it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will require some evidence to establish your right to the ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill the letter of the purchaser, Monsieur Bessy, be sufficient!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mon. Gerbois, producing the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Leave these papers with us. The rules of the lottery allow\r\nus fifteen days\xe2\x80\x99 time to investigate your claim. I will let you know\r\nwhen to call for your money. I presume you desire, as much as I do,\r\nthat this affair should be closed without further publicity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Gerbois and the governor henceforth maintained a discreet silence.\r\nBut the secret was revealed in some way, for it was soon commonly known\r\nthat Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had returned the lottery ticket to Mon. Gerbois. The\r\npublic received the news with astonishment and admiration. Certainly,\r\nhe was a bold gamester who thus threw upon the table a trump card of\r\nsuch importance as the precious ticket. But, it was true, he still\r\nretained a trump card of equal importance. However, if the young girl\r\nshould escape? If the hostage held by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin should be rescued?\r\n\r\nThe police thought they had discovered the weak spot of the enemy, and\r\nnow redoubled their efforts. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin disarmed by his own act,\r\ncrushed by the wheels of his own machination, deprived of every sou of\r\nthe coveted million ... public interest now centered in the camp of his\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary to find Suzanne. And they did not find her, nor\r\ndid she escape. Consequently, it must be admitted, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had won\r\nthe first hand. But the game was not yet decided. The most difficult\r\npoint remained. Mlle. Gerbois is in his possession, and he will hold\r\nher until he receives five hundred thousand francs. But how and where\r\nwill such an exchange be made? For that purpose, a meeting must be\r\narranged, and then what will prevent Mon. Gerbois from warning the\r\npolice and, in that way, effecting the rescue of his daughter and, at\r\nthe same time, keeping his money? The professor was interviewed, but he\r\nwas extremely reticent. His answer was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mlle. Gerbois?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe search is being continued.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin has written to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you swear to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is true. What are his instructions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the interviewers attacked Mon. Detinan, and found him equally\r\ndiscreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Lupin is my client, and I cannot discuss his affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied, with an affected air of gravity.\r\n\r\nThese mysteries served to irritate the gallery. Obviously, some secret\r\nnegotiations were in progress. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had arranged and tightened\r\nthe meshes of his net, while the police maintained a close watch, day\r\nand night, over Mon. Gerbois. And the three and only possible\r\nd\xc3\xa9nouements\xe2\x80\x94the arrest, the triumph, or the ridiculous and pitiful\r\nabortion\xe2\x80\x94were freely discussed; but the curiosity of the public was\r\nonly partially satisfied, and it was reserved for these pages to reveal\r\nthe exact truth of the affair.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday, March 12th, Mon. Gerbois received a notice from the Cr\xc3\xa9dit\r\nFoncier. On Wednesday, he took the one o\xe2\x80\x99clock train for Paris. At two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, a thousand bank-notes of one thousand francs each were\r\ndelivered to him. Whilst he was counting them, one by one, in a state\r\nof nervous agitation\xe2\x80\x94that money, which represented Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s ransom\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncarriage containing two men stopped at the curb a short distance from\r\nthe bank. One of the men had grey hair and an unusually shrewd\r\nexpression which formed a striking contrast to his shabby make-up. It\r\nwas Detective Ganimard, the relentless enemy of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. Ganimard\r\nsaid to his companion, Folenfant:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn five minutes, we will see our clever friend Lupin. Is everything\r\nready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many men have we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight\xe2\x80\x94two of them on bicycles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, but not too many. On no account, must Gerbois escape us; if he\r\ndoes, it is all up. He will meet Lupin at the appointed place, give\r\nhalf a million in exchange for the girl, and the game will be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Gerbois work with us? That would be the better way,\r\nand he could keep all the money himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he is afraid that if he deceives the other, he will not get\r\nhis daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard pronounced the word in a solemn tone, somewhat timidly, as if\r\nhe were speaking of some supernatural creature whose claws he already\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very strange,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Folenfant, judiciously, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are\r\nobliged to protect this gentleman contrary to his own wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but Lupin always turns the world upside down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard,\r\nmournfully.\r\n\r\nA moment later, Mon. Gerbois appeared, and started up the street. At\r\nthe end of the rue des Capucines, he turned into the boulevards,\r\nwalking slowly, and stopping frequently to gaze at the shop-windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch too calm, too self-possessed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cA man with a\r\nmillion in his pocket would not have that air of tranquillity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! nothing, evidently.... But I have a suspicion that it is\r\nLupin\xe2\x80\x94yes, Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Mon. Gerbois stopped at a news-stand, purchased a\r\npaper, unfolded it and commenced to read it as he walked slowly away. A\r\nmoment later, he gave a sudden bound into an automobile that was\r\nstanding at the curb. Apparently, the machine had been waiting for him,\r\nas it started away rapidly, turned at the Madeleine and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNom de nom!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s one of his old tricks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard hastened after the automobile around the Madeleine. Then, he\r\nburst into laughter. At the entrance to the Boulevard Malesherbes, the\r\nautomobile had stopped and Mon. Gerbois had alighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Folenfant, the chauffeur! It may be the man Ernest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFolenfant interviewed the chauffeur. His name was Gaston; he was an\r\nemployee of the automobile cab company; ten minutes ago, a gentleman\r\nhad engaged him and told him to wait near the news-stand for another\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the second man\xe2\x80\x94what address did he give?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Folenfant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo address. \xe2\x80\x98Boulevard Malesherbes ... avenue de Messine ... double\r\npourboire.\xe2\x80\x99 That is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, during this time, Mon. Gerbois had leaped into the first passing\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Concorde station, Metropolitan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the driver.\r\n\r\nHe left the underground at the Place du Palais-Royal, ran to another\r\ncarriage and ordered it to go to the Place de la Bourse. Then a second\r\njourney by the underground to the Avenue de Villiers, followed by a\r\nthird carriage drive to number 25 rue Clapeyron.\r\n\r\nNumber 25 rue Clapeyron is separated from the Boulevard des Batignolles\r\nby the house which occupies the angle formed by the two streets. He\r\nascended to the first floor and rang. A gentleman opened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Monsieur Detinan live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is my name. Are you Monsieur Gerbois?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was expecting you. Step in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mon. Gerbois entered the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office, the clock struck three. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am prompt to the minute. Is he here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Gerbois took a seat, wiped his forehead, looked at his watch as if\r\nhe did not know the time, and inquired, anxiously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I do not know, but I am\r\nquite as anxious and impatient as you are to find out. If he comes, he\r\nwill run a great risk, as this house has been closely watched for the\r\nlast two weeks. They distrust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey suspect me, too. I am not sure whether the detectives lost sight\r\nof me or not on my way here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you were\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the professor, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot\r\nreproach me. I promised to obey his orders, and I followed them to the\r\nvery letter. I drew the money at the time fixed by him, and I came here\r\nin the manner directed by him. I have faithfully performed my part of\r\nthe agreement\xe2\x80\x94let him do his!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a short silence, he asked, anxiously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will bring my daughter, won\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ... you have seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? No, not yet. He made the appointment by letter, saying both of you\r\nwould be here, and asking me to dismiss my servants before three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock and admit no one while you were here. If I would not consent to\r\nthat arrangement, I was to notify him by a few words in the _Echo de\r\nFrance_. But I am only too happy to oblige Mon. Lupin, and so I\r\nconsented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! how will this end?\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Mon. Gerbois.\r\n\r\nHe took the bank-notes from his pocket, placed them on the table and\r\ndivided them into two equal parts. Then the two men sat there in\r\nsilence. From time to time, Mon. Gerbois would listen. Did someone\r\nring?... His nervousness increased every minute, and Monsieur Detinan\r\nalso displayed considerable anxiety. At last, the lawyer lost his\r\npatience. He rose abruptly, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not come.... We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it. It would be folly on his\r\npart. He would run too great a risk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mon. Gerbois, despondent, his hands resting on the bank-notes,\r\nstammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mon Dieu! I hope he will come. I would give the whole of that\r\nmoney to see my daughter again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf of it will be sufficient, Monsieur Gerbois.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken by a well-dressed young man who now entered the\r\nroom and was immediately recognized by Mon. Gerbois as the person who\r\nhad wished to buy the desk from him at Versailles. He rushed toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my daughter\xe2\x80\x94my Suzanne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin carefully closed the door, and, while slowly removing his\r\ngloves, said to the lawyer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear ma\xc3\xaetre, I am indebted to you very much for your kindness in\r\nconsenting to defend my interests. I shall not forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Detinan murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did not ring. I did not hear the door\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoors and bells are things that should work without being heard. I am\r\nhere, and that is the important point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter! Suzanne! Where is she!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the professor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s your hurry? Your daughter\r\nwill be here in a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin walked to and fro for a minute, then, with the pompous air of an\r\norator, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Gerbois, I congratulate you on the clever way in which you\r\nmade the journey to this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, perceiving the two piles of bank-notes, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I see! the million is here. We will not lose any time. Permit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, placing himself before the table. \xe2\x80\x9cMlle.\r\nGerbois has not yet arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not her presence indispensable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand! I understand! Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin inspires only a limited\r\nconfidence. He might pocket the half-million and not restore the\r\nhostage. Ah! monsieur, people do not understand me. Because I have been\r\nobliged, by force of circumstances, to commit certain actions a little\r\n... out of the ordinary, my good faith is impugned ... I, who have\r\nalways observed the utmost scrupulosity and delicacy in business\r\naffairs. Besides, my dear monsieur if you have any fear, open the\r\nwindow and call. There are at least a dozen detectives in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin raised the curtain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that Monsieur Gerbois could not throw Ganimard off the\r\nscent.... What did I tell you? There he is now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the professor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I swear to you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you have not betrayed me?... I do not doubt you, but those\r\nfellows are clever\xe2\x80\x94sometimes. Ah! I can see Folenfant, and Greaume, and\r\nDieuzy\xe2\x80\x94all good friends of mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Detinan looked at Lupin in amazement. What assurance! He laughed\r\nas merrily as if engaged in some childish sport, as if no danger\r\nthreatened him. This unconcern reassured the lawyer more than the\r\npresence of the detectives. He left the table on which the bank-notes\r\nwere lying. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin picked up one pile of bills after the other,\r\ntook from each of them twenty-five bank-notes which he offered to Mon.\r\nDetinan, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reward of your services to Monsieur Gerbois and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. You\r\nwell deserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou owe me nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! After all the trouble we have caused you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all the pleasure you have given me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means, my dear monsieur, that you do not wish to accept anything\r\nfrom Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. See what it is to have a bad reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then offered the fifty thousand francs to Mon. Gerbois, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, in memory of our pleasant interview, permit me to return you\r\nthis as a wedding-gift to Mlle. Gerbois.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Gerbois took the money, but said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter will not marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will not marry if you refuse your consent; but she wishes to\r\nmarry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that young girls often dream of such things unknown to their\r\nparents. Fortunately, there are sometimes good genii like Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nwho discover their little secrets in the drawers of their writing\r\ndesks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you find anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cI confess I am curious\r\nto know why you took so much trouble to get possession of that desk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn account of its historic interest, my friend. Although despite the\r\nopinion of Monsieur Gerbois, the desk contained no treasure except the\r\nlottery ticket\xe2\x80\x94and that was unknown to me\xe2\x80\x94I had been seeking it for a\r\nlong time. That writing-desk of yew and mahogany was discovered in the\r\nlittle house in which Marie Wal\xc3\xaawska once lived in Boulogne, and, on\r\none of the drawers there is this inscription: \xe2\x80\x98_Dedicated to Napoleon\r\nI, Emperor of the French, by his very faithful servant, Mancion_.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nabove it, these words, engraved with the point of a knife: \xe2\x80\x98To you,\r\nMarie.\xe2\x80\x99 Afterwards, Napoleon had a similar desk made for the Empress\r\nJosephine; so that the secretary that was so much admired at the\r\nMalmaison was only an imperfect copy of the one that will henceforth\r\nform part of my collection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! if I had known, when in the shop, I would gladly have given it up\r\nto you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the professor.\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin smiled, as he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would have had the advantage of keeping for your own use\r\nlottery ticket number 514.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would not have found it necessary to abduct my daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbduct your daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear monsieur, you are mistaken. Mlle. Gerbois was not abducted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. Abduction means force or violence. And I assure you\r\nthat she served as hostage of her own free will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf her own free will!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mon. Gerbois, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, she almost asked to be taken. Why, do you suppose that an\r\nintelligent young girl like Mlle. Gerbois, and who, moreover, nourishes\r\nan unacknowledged passion, would hesitate to do what was necessary to\r\nsecure her dowry. Ah! I swear to you it was not difficult to make her\r\nunderstand that it was the only way to overcome your obstinacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Detinan was greatly amused. He replied to Lupin:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I should think it was more difficult to get her to listen to you.\r\nHow did you approach her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t approach her myself. I have not the honor of her\r\nacquaintance. A friend of mine, a lady, carried on the negotiations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blonde woman in the automobile, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. All arrangements were made at the first interview near the\r\ncollege. Since then, Mlle. Gerbois and her new friend have been\r\ntravelling in Belgium and Holland in a manner that should prove most\r\npleasing and instructive to a young girl. She will tell you all about\r\nit herself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bell of the vestibule door rang, three rings in quick succession,\r\nfollowed by two isolated rings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is she,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Detinan, if you will be so kind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer hastened to the door.\r\n\r\nTwo young women entered. One of them threw herself into the arms of\r\nMon. Gerbois. The other approached Lupin. The latter was a tall woman\r\nof a good figure, very pale complexion, and with blond hair, parted\r\nover her forehead in undulating waves, that glistened and shone like\r\nthe setting sun. She was dressed in black, with no display of jewelled\r\nornaments; but, on the contrary, her appearance indicated good taste\r\nand refined elegance. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin spoke a few words to her; then,\r\nbowing to Mlle. Gerbois, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe you an apology, mademoiselle, for all your troubles, but I hope\r\nyou have not been too unhappy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy! Why, I should have been very happy, indeed, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nfor leaving my poor father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all is for the best. Kiss him again, and take advantage of the\r\nopportunity\xe2\x80\x94it is an excellent one\xe2\x80\x94to speak to him about your cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin! What do you mean? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you understand. Your cousin Philippe. The young man whose\r\nletters you kept so carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuzanne blushed; but, following Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s advice, she again threw herself\r\ninto her father\xe2\x80\x99s arms. Lupin gazed upon them with a tender look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Such is my reward for a virtuous act! What a touching picture! A\r\nhappy father and a happy daughter! And to know that their joy is your\r\nwork, Lupin! Hereafter these people will bless you, and reverently\r\ntransmit your name unto their descendants, even unto the fourth\r\ngeneration. What a glorious reward, Lupin, for one act of kindness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs dear old Ganimard still waiting?... He would like very much to be\r\npresent at this charming domestic scene!... Ah! he is not there.... Nor\r\nany of the others.... I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anyone. The deuce! The situation is\r\nbecoming serious. I dare say they are already under the porte-cochere\r\n... talking to the concierge, perhaps ... or, even, ascending the\r\nstairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Gerbois made a sudden movement. Now, that his daughter had been\r\nrestored to him, he saw the situation in a different light. To him, the\r\narrest of his adversary meant half-a-million francs. Instinctively, he\r\nmade a step forward. As if by chance, Lupin stood in his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going, Monsieur Gerbois? To defend me against them! That\r\nis very kind of you, but I assure you it is not necessary. They are\r\nmore worried than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he continued to speak, with calm deliberation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, really, what do they know? That you are here, and, perhaps, that\r\nMlle. Gerbois is here, for they may have seen her arrive with an\r\nunknown lady. But they do not imagine that I am here. How is it\r\npossible that I could be in a house that they ransacked from cellar to\r\ngarret this morning? They suppose that the unknown lady was sent by me\r\nto make the exchange, and they will be ready to arrest her when she\r\ngoes out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the bell rang. With a brusque movement, Lupin seized\r\nMon. Gerbois, and said to him, in an imperious tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not move! Remember your daughter, and be prudent\xe2\x80\x94otherwise\xe2\x80\x94 As to\r\nyou, Monsieur Detinan, I have your promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Gerbois was rooted to the spot. The lawyer did not stir. Without\r\nthe least sign of haste, Lupin picked up his hat and brushed the dust\r\nfrom off it with his sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Monsieur Detinan, if I can ever be of service to you.... My\r\nbest wishes, Mademoiselle Suzanne, and my kind regards to Monsieur\r\nPhilippe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew a heavy gold watch from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Gerbois, it is now forty-two minutes past three. At forty-six\r\nminutes past three, I give you permission to leave this room. Not one\r\nminute sooner than forty-six minutes past three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they will force an entrance,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mon. Detinan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget the law, my dear monsieur! Ganimard would never venture to\r\nviolate the privacy of a French citizen. But, pardon me, time flies,\r\nand you are all slightly nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe placed his watch on the table, opened the door of the room and\r\naddressing the blonde lady he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew back to let her pass, bowed respectfully to Mlle. Gerbois, and\r\nwent out, closing the door behind him. Then they heard him in the\r\nvestibule, speaking, in a loud voice: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, Ganimard, how goes it?\r\nRemember me to Madame Ganimard. One of these days, I shall invite her\r\nto breakfast. Au revoir, Ganimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bell rang violently, followed by repeated rings, and voices on the\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForty-five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mon. Gerbois.\r\n\r\nAfter a few seconds, he left the room and stepped into the vestibule.\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and the blonde lady had gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa!... you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t! Wait!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Suzanne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait! you are foolish!... No quarter for that rascal!... And the\r\nhalf-million?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened the outer door. Ganimard rushed in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman\xe2\x80\x94where is she? And Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was here ... he is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard uttered a cry of triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have him. The house is surrounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the servant\xe2\x80\x99s stairway?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mon. Detinan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt leads to the court,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one exit\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nstreet-door. Ten men are guarding it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come in by the street-door, and he will not go out that\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat way, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cThrough the air?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew aside a curtain and exposed a long corridor leading to the\r\nkitchen. Ganimard ran along it and tried the door of the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstairway. It was locked. From the window he called to one of his\r\nassistants:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeen anyone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they are still in the house!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are hiding in\r\none of the rooms! They cannot have escaped. Ah! Lupin, you fooled me\r\nbefore, but, this time, I get my revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, Mon. Dudonis, chief of the detective\r\nservice, astonished at not receiving any news, visited the rue\r\nClapeyron. He questioned the detectives who were guarding the house,\r\nthen ascended to Mon. Detinan\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. The lawyer led him into his\r\nroom. There, Mon. Dudonis beheld a man, or rather two legs kicking in\r\nthe air, while the body to which they belonged was hidden in the depths\r\nof the chimney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xc3\xa9!... Oh\xc3\xa9!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped a stifled voice. And a more distant voice, from\r\non high, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xc3\xa9!... Oh\xc3\xa9!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Dudonis laughed, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Ganimard, have you turned chimney-sweep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe detective crawled out of the chimney. With his blackened face, his\r\nsooty clothes, and his feverish eyes, he was quite unrecognizable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am looking for _him_,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin ... and his friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you suppose they are hiding in the chimney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard arose, laid his sooty hand on the sleeve of his superior\r\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s coat, and exclaimed, angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you think they are, chief? They must be somewhere! They are\r\nflesh and blood like you and me, and can\xe2\x80\x99t fade away like smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but they have faded away just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how? How? The house is surrounded by our men\xe2\x80\x94even on the roof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the adjoining house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no communication with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the apartments on the other floors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know all the tenants. They have not seen anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you know all of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The concierge answers for them. Besides, as an extra precaution,\r\nI have placed a man in each apartment. They can\xe2\x80\x99t escape. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget them to-night, I will get them to-morrow. I shall sleep here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe slept there that night and the two following nights. Three days and\r\nnights passed away without the discovery of the irrepressible Lupin or\r\nhis female companion; more than that, Ganimard did not unearth the\r\nslightest clue on which to base a theory to explain their escape. For\r\nthat reason, he adhered to his first opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no trace of their escape; therefore, they are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may be that, at the bottom of his heart, his conviction was less\r\nfirmly established, but he would not confess it. No, a thousand times,\r\nno! A man and a woman could not vanish like the evil spirits in a fairy\r\ntale. And, without losing his courage, he continued his searches, as if\r\nhe expected to find the fugitives concealed in some impenetrable\r\nretreat, or embodied in the stone walls of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE BLUE DIAMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of March 27, at number 134 avenue Henri-Martin, in the\r\nhouse that he had inherited from his brother six months before, the old\r\ngeneral Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, ambassador at Berlin under the second Empire,\r\nwas asleep in a comfortable armchair, while his secretary was reading\r\nto him, and the Sister Auguste was warming his bed and preparing the\r\nnight-lamp. At eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the Sister, who was obliged to return to\r\nthe convent of her order at that hour, said to the secretary:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Antoinette, my work is finished; I am going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not forget that the cook is away, and that you are alone in the\r\nhouse with the servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave no fear for the Baron. I sleep in the adjoining room and always\r\nleave the door open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sister left the house. A few moments later, Charles, the servant,\r\ncame to receive his orders. The Baron was now awake, and spoke for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe usual orders, Charles: see that the electric bell rings in your\r\nroom, and, at the first alarm, run for the doctor. Now, Mademoiselle\r\nAntoinette, how far did we get in our reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Monsieur not going to bed now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I will go later. Besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later, he was sleeping again, and Antoinette crept away\r\non tiptoe. At that moment, Charles was closing the shutters on the\r\nlower floor. In the kitchen, he bolted the door leading to the garden,\r\nand, in the vestibule, he not only locked the door but hooked the chain\r\nas well. Then he ascended to his room on the third floor, went to bed,\r\nand was soon asleep.\r\n\r\nProbably an hour had passed, when he leaped from his bed in alarm. The\r\nbell was ringing. It rang for some time, seven or eight seconds\r\nperhaps, without intermission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Charles, recovering his wits, \xe2\x80\x9canother of the Baron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhims.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dressed himself quickly, descended the stairs, stopped in front of\r\nthe door, and rapped, according to his custom. He received no reply. He\r\nopened the door and entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! no light,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, in a low voice, he called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you there, mademoiselle? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? Is Monsieur le Baron\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo reply. Nothing but a profound silence that soon became depressing.\r\nHe took two steps forward; his foot struck a chair, and, having touched\r\nit, he noticed that it was overturned. Then, with his hand, he\r\ndiscovered other objects on the floor\xe2\x80\x94a small table and a screen.\r\nAnxiously, he approached the wall, felt for the electric button, and\r\nturned on the light.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the room, between the table and dressing-case, lay the\r\nbody of his master, the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!... It can\xe2\x80\x99t be possible!\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\nHe could not move. He stood there, with bulging eyes, gazing stupidly\r\nat the terrible disorder, the overturned chairs, a large crystal\r\ncandelabra shattered in a thousand pieces, the clock lying on the\r\nmarble hearthstone, all evidence of a fearful and desperate struggle.\r\nThe handle of a stiletto glittered, not far from the corpse; the blade\r\nwas stained with blood. A handkerchief, marked with red spots, was\r\nlying on the edge of the bed.\r\n\r\nCharles recoiled with horror: the body lying at his feet extended\r\nitself for a moment, then shrunk up again; two or three tremors, and\r\nthat was the end.\r\n\r\nHe stooped over the body. There was a clean-cut wound on the neck from\r\nwhich the blood was flowing and then congealing in a black pool on the\r\ncarpet. The face retained an expression of extreme terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one has killed him!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9csome one has killed him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he shuddered at the thought that there might be another dreadful\r\ncrime. Did not the baron\xe2\x80\x99s secretary sleep in the adjoining room? Had\r\nnot the assassin killed her also? He opened the door; the room was\r\nempty. He concluded that Antoinette had been abducted, or else she had\r\ngone away before the crime. He returned to the baron\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, his\r\nglance falling on the secretary, he noticed that that article of\r\nfurniture remained intact. Then, he saw upon a table, beside a bunch of\r\nkeys and a pocketbook that the baron placed there every night, a\r\nhandful of golden louis. Charles seized the pocketbook, opened it, and\r\nfound some bank-notes. He counted them; there were thirteen notes of\r\none hundred francs each.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, mechanically, he put the bank-notes in his pocket,\r\nrushed down the stairs, drew the bolt, unhooked the chain, closed the\r\ndoor behind him, and fled to the street.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles was an honest man. He had scarcely left the gate, when, cooled\r\nby the night air and the rain, he came to a sudden halt. Now, he saw\r\nhis action in its true light, and it filled him with horror. He hailed\r\na passing cab, and said to the driver:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the police-office, and bring the commissary. Hurry! There has\r\nbeen a murder in that house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cab-driver whipped his horse. Charles wished to return to the\r\nhouse, but found the gate locked. He had closed it himself when he came\r\nout, and it could not be opened from the outside. On the other hand, it\r\nwas useless to ring, as there was no one in the house.\r\n\r\nIt was almost an hour before the arrival of the police. When they came,\r\nCharles told his story and handed the bank-notes to the commissary. A\r\nlocksmith was summoned, and, after considerable difficulty, he\r\nsucceeded in forcing open the garden gate and the vestibule door. The\r\ncommissary of police entered the room first, but, immediately, turned\r\nto Charles and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me that the room was in the greatest disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharles stood at the door, amazed, bewildered; all the furniture had\r\nbeen restored to its accustomed place. The small table was standing\r\nbetween the two windows, the chairs were upright, and the clock was on\r\nthe centre of the mantel. The debris of the candelabra had been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is.... Monsieur le Baron?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is the victim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe approached the bed, and drew aside a large sheet, under which\r\nreposed the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, formerly French Ambassador at Berlin. Over\r\nhim, lay his military coat, adorned with the Cross of Honor. His\r\nfeatures were calm. His eyes were closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one has been here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did they get in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but some one has been here during my absence. There was\r\na stiletto on the floor\xe2\x80\x94there! And a handkerchief, stained with blood,\r\non the bed. They are not here now. They have been carried away. And\r\nsome one has put the room in order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho would do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe assassin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we found all the doors locked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have remained in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he must be here yet, as you were in front of the house all the\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharles reflected a moment, then said, slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes ... of course.... I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go away from the gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was the last person you saw with the baron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Antoinette, his secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Her bed wasn\xe2\x80\x99t occupied, so she must have gone out. I am\r\nnot surprised at that, as she is young and pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how could she leave the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the door,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you had bolted and chained it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but she must have left before that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the crime was committed after her departure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said the servant.\r\n\r\nThe house was searched from cellar to garret, but the assassin had\r\nfled. How? And when? Was it he or an accomplice who had returned to the\r\nscene of the crime and removed everything that might furnish a clue to\r\nhis identity? Such were the questions the police were called upon to\r\nsolve.\r\n\r\nThe coroner came at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock; and, at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Mon. Dudouis,\r\nthe head of the detective service, arrived on the scene. They were\r\nfollowed by the Procureur of the Republic and the investigating\r\nmagistrate. In addition to these officials, the house was overrun with\r\npolicemen, detectives, newspaper reporters, photographers, and\r\nrelatives and acquaintances of the murdered man.\r\n\r\nA thorough search was made; they studied out the position of the corpse\r\naccording to the information furnished by Charles; they questioned\r\nSister Auguste when she arrived; but they discovered nothing new.\r\nSister Auguste was astonished to learn of the disappearance of\r\nAntoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat. She had engaged the young girl twelve days before,\r\non excellent recommendations, and refused to believe that she would\r\nneglect her duty by leaving the house during the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, you see, she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t returned yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\r\nare still confronted with the question: What has become of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she was abducted by the assassin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charles.\r\n\r\nThe theory was plausible, and was borne out by certain facts. Mon.\r\nDudouis agreed with it. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbducted? ma foi! that is not improbable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only improbable,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut absolutely opposed to the\r\nfacts. There is not a particle of evidence to support such a theory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice was harsh, the accent sharp, and no one was surprised to\r\nlearn that the speaker was Ganimard. In no one else, would they\r\ntolerate such a domineering tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is you, Ganimard!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mon. Dudouis. \xe2\x80\x9cI had not seen you\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been here since two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are interested in some things outside of lottery ticket number\r\n514, the affair of the rue Clapeyron, the blonde lady and Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa-ha!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the veteran detective. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not say that Lupin is\r\na stranger to the present case. But let us forget the affair of the\r\nlottery ticket for a few moments, and try to unravel this new mystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nGanimard is not one of those celebrated detectives whose methods will\r\ncreate a school, or whose name will be immortalized in the criminal\r\nannals of his country. He is devoid of those flashes of genius which\r\ncharacterize the work of Dupin, Lecoq and Sherlock Holmes. Yet, it must\r\nbe admitted, he possesses superior qualities of observation, sagacity,\r\nperseverance and even intuition. His merit lies in his absolute\r\nindependence. Nothing troubles or influences him, except, perhaps, a\r\nsort of fascination that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin holds over him. However that may\r\nbe, there is no doubt that his position on that morning, in the house\r\nof the late Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, was one of undoubted superiority, and his\r\ncollaboration in the case was appreciated and desired by the\r\ninvestigating magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9cI will ask Monsieur Charles to be\r\nvery particular on one point: He says that, on the occasion of his\r\nfirst visit to the room, various articles of furniture were overturned\r\nand strewn about the place; now, I ask him whether, on his second visit\r\nto the room, he found all those articles restored to their accustomed\r\nplaces\xe2\x80\x94I mean, of course, correctly placed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all in their proper places,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is obvious, then, that the person who replaced them must have been\r\nfamiliar with the location of those articles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe logic of this remark was apparent to his hearers. Ganimard\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more question, Monsieur Charles. You were awakened by the ringing\r\nof your bell. Now, who, do you think, rang it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur le baron, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen could he ring it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the struggle ... when he was dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible; because you found him lying, unconscious, at a point more\r\nthan four metres from the bell-button.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he must have rung during the struggle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9csince the ringing, as you have said,\r\nwas continuous and uninterrupted, and lasted seven or eight seconds. Do\r\nyou think his antagonist would have permitted him to ring the bell in\r\nthat leisurely manner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it was before the attack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso, quite impossible, since you have told us that the lapse of time\r\nbetween the ringing of the bell and your entrance to the room was not\r\nmore than three minutes. Therefore, if the baron rang before the\r\nattack, we are forced to the conclusion that the struggle, the murder\r\nand the flight of the assassin, all occurred within the short space of\r\nthree minutes. I repeat: that is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9csome one rang. If it were not the\r\nbaron, who was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe murderer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. But the fact that he did ring proves that he knew that\r\nthe bell communicated with the servant\xe2\x80\x99s room. Now, who would know\r\nthat, except an inmate of the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard was drawing the meshes of his net closer and tighter. In a few\r\nclear and logical sentences, he had unfolded and defined his theory of\r\nthe crime, so that it seemed quite natural when the magistrate said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I understand it, Ganimard, you suspect the girl Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not suspect her; I accuse her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou accuse her of being an accomplice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accuse her of having killed Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! What proof have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe handful of hair I found in the right hand of the victim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe produced the hair; it was of a beautiful blond color, and glittered\r\nlike threads of gold. Charles looked at it, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Mademoiselle Antoinette\xe2\x80\x99s hair. There can be no doubt of it.\r\nAnd, then, there is another thing. I believe that the knife, which I\r\nsaw on my first visit to the room, belonged to her. She used it to cut\r\nthe leaves of books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long, dreadful silence followed, as if the crime had acquired an\r\nadditional horror by reason of having been committed by a woman. At\r\nlast, the magistrate said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us assume, until we are better informed, that the baron was killed\r\nby Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat. We have yet to learn where she concealed herself\r\nafter the crime, how she managed to return after Charles left the\r\nhouse, and how she made her escape after the arrival of the police.\r\nHave you formed any opinion on those points Ganimard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, where do we stand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard was embarrassed. Finally, with a visible effort, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can say is that I find in this case the same method of procedure\r\nas we found in the affair of the lottery ticket number 514; the same\r\nphenomena, which might be termed the faculty of disappearing.\r\nAntoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat has appeared and disappeared in this house as\r\nmysteriously as Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin entered the house of Monsieur Detinan and\r\nescaped therefrom in the company of the blonde lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that signify anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does to me. I can see a probable connection between those two\r\nstrange incidents. Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat was hired by Sister Auguste twelve\r\ndays ago, that is to say, on the day after the blonde Lady so cleverly\r\nslipped through my fingers. In the second place, the hair of the blonde\r\nLady was exactly of the same brilliant golden hue as the hair found in\r\nthis case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that, in your opinion, Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the blonde Lady\xe2\x80\x94precisely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that Lupin had a hand in both cases?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis statement was greeted with an outburst of laughter. It came from\r\nMon. Dudouis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLupin! always Lupin! Lupin is into everything; Lupin is everywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Lupin is into everything of any consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ganimard,\r\nvexed at the ridicule of his superior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so far as I see,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mon. Dudouis, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have not\r\ndiscovered any motive for this crime. The secretary was not broken\r\ninto, nor the pocketbook carried away. Even, a pile of gold was left\r\nupon the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is so,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the famous diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blue diamond! The celebrated diamond which formed part of the\r\nroyal crown of France, and which was given by the Duke d\xe2\x80\x99Aumale to\r\nLeonide Lebrun, and, at the death of Leonide Lebrun, was purchased by\r\nthe Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec as a souvenir of the charming comedienne that he\r\nhad loved so well. That is one of those things that an old Parisian,\r\nlike I, does not forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is obvious that if the blue diamond is not found, the motive for\r\nthe crime is disclosed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where should we\r\nsearch for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the baron\xe2\x80\x99s finger,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Charles. \xe2\x80\x9cHe always wore the blue\r\ndiamond on his left hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw that hand, and there was only a plain gold ring on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGanimard, as he approached the corpse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook in the palm of the hand,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the servant.\r\n\r\nGanimard opened the stiffened hand. The bezel was turned inward, and,\r\nin the centre of that bezel, the blue diamond shone with all its\r\nglorious splendor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Ganimard, absolutely amazed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will now apologize to Lupin for having suspected him, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMon. Dudouis, laughing.\r\n\r\nGanimard paused for a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, and then replied,\r\nsententiously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only when I do not understand things that I suspect Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the facts established by the police on the day after the\r\ncommission of that mysterious crime. Facts that were vague and\r\nincoherent in themselves, and which were not explained by any\r\nsubsequent discoveries. The movements of Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat remained as\r\ninexplicable as those of the blonde Lady, and the police discovered no\r\ntrace of that mysterious creature with the golden hair who had killed\r\nBaron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec and had failed to take from his finger the famous\r\ndiamond that had once shone in the royal crown of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heirs of the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec could not fail to benefit by such\r\nnotoriety. They established in the house an exhibition of the furniture\r\nand other objects which were to be sold at the auction rooms of Drouot\r\n& Co. Modern furniture of indifferent taste, various objects of no\r\nartistic value ... but, in the centre of the room, in a case of purple\r\nvelvet, protected by a glass globe, and guarded by two officers, was\r\nthe famous blue diamond ring.\r\n\r\nA large magnificent diamond of incomparable purity, and of that\r\nindefinite blue which the clear water receives from an unclouded sky,\r\nof that blue which can be detected in the whiteness of linen. Some\r\nadmired, some enthused ... and some looked with horror on the chamber\r\nof the victim, on the spot where the corpse had lain, on the floor\r\ndivested of its blood-stained carpet, and especially the walls, the\r\nunsurmountable walls over which the criminal must have passed. Some\r\nassured themselves that the marble mantel did not move, others imagined\r\ngaping holes, mouths of tunnels, secret connections with the sewers,\r\nand the catacombs\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe sale of the blue diamond took place at the salesroom of Drouot &\r\nCo. The place was crowded to suffocation, and the bidding was carried\r\nto the verge of folly. The sale was attended by all those who usually\r\nappear at similar events in Paris; those who buy, and those who make a\r\npretense of being able to buy; bankers, brokers, artists, women of all\r\nclasses, two cabinet ministers, an Italian tenor, an exiled king who,\r\nin order to maintain his credit, bid, with much ostentation, and in a\r\nloud voice, as high as one hundred thousand francs. One hundred\r\nthousand francs! He could offer that sum without any danger of his bid\r\nbeing accepted. The Italian tenor risked one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand, and a member of the Com\xc3\xa9die-Fran\xc3\xa7aise bid one hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand francs.\r\n\r\nWhen the bidding reached two hundred thousand francs, the smaller\r\ncompetitors fell out of the race. At two hundred and fifty thousand,\r\nonly two bidders remained in the field: Herschmann, the well-known\r\ncapitalist, the king of gold mines; and the Countess de Crozon, the\r\nwealthy American, whose collection of diamonds and precious stones is\r\nfamed throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hundred and sixty thousand ... two hundred and seventy thousand\r\n... seventy-five ... eighty....\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the auctioneer, as he\r\nglanced at the two competitors in succession. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo hundred and eighty\r\nthousand for madame.... Do I hear any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herschmann.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence. The countess was standing, smiling, but pale\r\nfrom excitement. She was leaning against the back of the chair in front\r\nof her. She knew, and so did everyone present, that the issue of the\r\nduel was certain; logically, inevitably, it must terminate to the\r\nadvantage of the capitalist, who had untold millions with which to\r\nindulge his caprices. However, the countess made another bid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred and five thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother silence. All eyes were now directed to the capitalist in the\r\nexpectation that he would raise the bidding. But Herschmann was not\r\npaying any attention to the sale; his eyes were fixed on a sheet of\r\npaper which he held in his right hand, while the other hand held a torn\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred and five thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the auctioneer. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce!...\r\nTwice!... For the last time.... Do I hear any more?... Once!...\r\nTwice!... Am I offered any more? Last chance!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerschmann did not move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThird and last time!... Sold!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the auctioneer, as his hammer\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour hundred thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herschman, starting up, as if the sound\r\nof the hammer had roused him from his stupor.\r\n\r\nToo late; the auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s decision was irrevocable. Some of\r\nHerschmann\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintances pressed around him. What was the matter? Why\r\ndid he not speak sooner? He laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa foi! I simply forgot\xe2\x80\x94in a moment of abstraction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I just received a letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that letter was sufficient\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo distract my attention? Yes, for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard was there. He had come to witness the sale of the ring. He\r\nstopped one of the attendants of the auction room, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it you who carried the letter to Monsieur Herschmann?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?... She was sitting down there ... the lady who wore a\r\nthick veil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard hastened to the door, and saw the lady descending the stairs.\r\nHe ran after her. A crush of people delayed him at the entrance. When\r\nhe reached the sidewalk, she had disappeared. He returned to the\r\nauction room, accosted Herschmann, introduced himself, and enquired\r\nabout the letter. Herschmann handed it to him. It was carelessly\r\nscribbled in pencil, in a handwriting unknown to the capitalist, and\r\ncontained these few words:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cThe blue diamond brings misfortune. Remember the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vicissitudes of the blue diamond were not yet at an end. Although\r\nit had become well-known through the murder of the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec and\r\nthe incidents at the auction-rooms, it was six months later that it\r\nattained even greater celebrity. During the following summer, the\r\nCountess de Crozon was robbed of the famous jewel she had taken so much\r\ntrouble to acquire.\r\n\r\nLet me recall that strange affair, of which the exciting and dramatic\r\nincidents sent a thrill through all of us, and over which I am now\r\npermitted to throw some light.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of August 10, the guests of the Count and Countess de\r\nCrozon were assembled in the drawing-room of the magnificent ch\xc3\xa2teau\r\nwhich overlooks the Bay de Somme. To entertain her friends, the\r\ncountess seated herself at the piano to play for them, after first\r\nplacing her jewels on a small table near the piano, and, amongst them,\r\nwas the ring of the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the count and the majority of the guests retired,\r\nincluding his two cousins and Madame de R\xc3\xa9al, an intimate friend of the\r\ncountess. The latter remained in the drawing-room with Herr Bleichen,\r\nthe Austrian consul, and his wife.\r\n\r\nThey conversed for a time, and then the countess extinguished the large\r\nlamp that stood on a table in the centre of the room. At the same\r\nmoment, Herr Bleichen extinguished the two piano lamps. There was a\r\nmomentary darkness; then the consul lighted a candle, and the three of\r\nthem retired to their rooms. But, as soon as she reached her apartment,\r\nthe countess remembered her jewels and sent her maid to get them. When\r\nthe maid returned with the jewels, she placed them on the mantel\r\nwithout the countess looking at them. Next day, Madame de Crozon found\r\nthat one of her rings was missing; it was the blue diamond ring.\r\n\r\nShe informed her husband, and, after talking it over, they reached the\r\nconclusion that the maid was above suspicion, and that the guilty party\r\nmust be Herr Bleichen.\r\n\r\nThe count notified the commissary of police at Amiens, who commenced an\r\ninvestigation and, discreetly, exercised a strict surveillance over the\r\nAustrian consul to prevent his disposing of the ring.\r\n\r\nThe ch\xc3\xa2teau was surrounded by detectives day and night. Two weeks\r\npassed without incident. Then Herr Bleichen announced his intended\r\ndeparture. That day, a formal complaint was entered against him. The\r\npolice made an official examination of his luggage. In a small satchel,\r\nthe key to which was always carried by the consul himself, they found a\r\nbottle of dentifrice, and in that bottle they found the ring.\r\n\r\nMadame Bleichen fainted. Her husband was placed under arrest.\r\n\r\nEveryone will remember the line of defense adopted by the accused man.\r\nHe declared that the ring must have been placed there by the Count de\r\nCrozen as an act of revenge. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count is brutal and makes his wife very unhappy. She consulted me,\r\nand I advised her to get a divorce. The count heard of it in some way,\r\nand, to be revenged on me, he took the ring and placed it in my\r\nsatchel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe count and countess persisted in pressing the charge. Between the\r\nexplanation which they gave and that of the consul, both equally\r\npossible and equally probable, the public had to choose. No new fact\r\nwas discovered to turn the scale in either direction. A month of\r\ngossip, conjectures and investigations failed to produce a single ray\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nWearied of the excitement and notoriety, and incapable of securing the\r\nevidence necessary to sustain their charge against the consul, the\r\ncount and countess at last sent to Paris for a detective competent to\r\nunravel the tangled threads of this mysterious skein. This brought\r\nGanimard into the case.\r\n\r\nFor four days, the veteran detective searched the house from top to\r\nbottom, examined every foot of the ground, had long conferences with\r\nthe maid, the chauffeur, the gardeners, the employees in the\r\nneighboring post-offices, visited the rooms that had been occupied by\r\nthe various guests. Then, one morning, he disappeared without taking\r\nleave of his host or hostess. But a week later, they received this\r\ntelegram:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease come to the Japanese Tea-room, rue Boissy d\xe2\x80\x99Anglas, to-morrow,\r\nFriday, evening at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Ganimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Friday evening, their automobile stopped in front of\r\nnumber nine rue Boissy-d\xe2\x80\x99Anglas. The old detective was standing on the\r\nsidewalk, waiting for them. Without a word, he conducted them to the\r\nfirst floor of the Japanese Tea-room. In one of the rooms, they met two\r\nmen, whom Ganimard introduced in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Gerbois, professor in the College of Versailles, from whom,\r\nyou will remember, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin stole half a million; Monsieur L\xc3\xa9once\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, nephew and sole legatee of the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, another man arrived. It was Mon. Dudouis, head of\r\nthe detective service, and he appeared to be in a particularly bad\r\ntemper. He bowed, and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble now, Ganimard? I received your telephone message\r\nasking me to come here. Is it anything of consequence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, chief, it is a very important matter. Within an hour, the last\r\ntwo cases to which I was assigned will have their d\xc3\xa9nouement here. It\r\nseemed to me that your presence was indispensable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd also the presence of Dieuzy and Folenfant, whom I noticed standing\r\nnear the door as I came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what? Are you going to make an arrest, and you wish to do it with\r\na flourish? Come, Ganimard, I am anxious to hear about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard hesitated a moment, then spoke with the obvious intention of\r\nmaking an impression on his hearers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, I wish to state that Herr Bleichen had nothing to\r\ndo with the theft of the ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mon. Dudouis, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a bold statement and a very\r\nserious one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that all you have discovered?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Count de Crozon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. On the second day after the theft, three of your guests\r\nwent on an automobile trip as far as Cr\xc3\xa9cy. Two of them visited the\r\nfamous battlefield; and, while they were there, the third party paid a\r\nhasty visit to the post-office, and mailed a small box, tied and sealed\r\naccording to the regulations, and declared its value to be one hundred\r\nfrancs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see nothing strange in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you will see something strange in it when I tell you that this\r\nperson, in place of giving her true name, sent the box under the name\r\nof Rousseau, and the person to whom it was addressed, a certain\r\nMonsieur Beloux of Paris, moved his place of residence immediately\r\nafter receiving the box, in other words, the ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume you refer to one of my cousins d\xe2\x80\x99Andelle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de R\xc3\xa9al, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou accuse my friend, Madam de R\xc3\xa9al?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the countess, shocked and\r\namazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to ask you one question, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cWas Madam de\r\nR\xc3\xa9al present when you purchased the ring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but we did not go there together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she advise you to buy the ring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe countess considered for a moment, then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think she mentioned it first\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, madame. Your answer establishes the fact that it was Madame\r\nde R\xc3\xa9al who was the first to mention the ring, and it was she who\r\nadvised you to buy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, I consider my friend is quite incapable\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, countess, when I remind you that Madame de R\xc3\xa9al is only a\r\ncasual acquaintance and not your intimate friend, as the newspapers\r\nhave announced. It was only last winter that you met her for the first\r\ntime. Now, I can prove that everything she has told you about herself,\r\nher past life, and her relatives, is absolutely false; that Madame\r\nBlanche de R\xc3\xa9al had no actual existence before she met you, and she has\r\nnow ceased to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour story is a very strange one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it has no\r\napplication to our case. If Madame de R\xc3\xa9al had taken the ring, how do\r\nyou explain the fact that it was found in Herr Bleichen\xe2\x80\x99s tooth-powder?\r\nAnyone who would take the risk and trouble of stealing the blue diamond\r\nwould certainly keep it. What do you say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94nothing\xe2\x80\x94but Madame de R\xc3\xa9al will answer it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! she does exist, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does\xe2\x80\x94and does not. I will explain in a few words. Three days ago,\r\nwhile reading a newspaper, I glanced over the list of hotel arrivals at\r\nTrouville, and there I read: \xe2\x80\x98H\xc3\xb4tel Beaurivage\xe2\x80\x94Madame de R\xc3\xa9al, etc.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to Trouville immediately, and interviewed the proprietor of the\r\nhotel. From the description and other information I received from him,\r\nI concluded that she was the very Madame de R\xc3\xa9al that I was seeking;\r\nbut she had left the hotel, giving her address in Paris as number three\r\nrue de Colis\xc3\xa9e. The day before yesterday I went to that address, and\r\nlearned that there was no person there called Madame de R\xc3\xa9al, but there\r\nwas a Madame R\xc3\xa9al, living on the second floor, who acted as a diamond\r\nbroker and was frequently away from home. She had returned from a\r\njourney on the preceding evening. Yesterday, I called on her and, under\r\nan assumed name, I offered to act as an intermedium in the sale of some\r\ndiamonds to certain wealthy friends of mine. She is to meet me here\r\nto-day to carry out that arrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You expect her to come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, at half-past five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure it is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de R\xc3\xa9al of the Ch\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon? Certainly. I have convincing\r\nevidence of that fact. But ... listen!... I hear Folenfant\xe2\x80\x99s signal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a whistle. Ganimard arose quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no time to lose. Monsieur and Madame de Crozon, will you be\r\nkind enough to go into the next room. You also, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, and\r\nyou, Monsieur Gerbois. The door will remain open, and when I give the\r\nsignal, you will come out. Of course, Chief, you will remain here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may be disturbed by other people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mon. Dudouis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. This is a new establishment, and the proprietor is one of my\r\nfriends. He will not let anyone disturb us\xe2\x80\x94except the blonde Lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blonde Lady! What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the blonde Lady herself, chief; the friend and accomplice of\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, the mysterious blonde Lady against whom I hold convincing\r\nevidence; but, in addition to that, I wish to confront her with all the\r\npeople she has robbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked through the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see her. She is coming in the door now. She can\xe2\x80\x99t escape: Folenfant\r\nand Dieuzy are guarding the door.... The blonde Lady is captured at\r\nlast, Chief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment later a woman appeared at the door; she was tall and slender,\r\nwith a very pale complexion and bright golden hair. Ganimard trembled\r\nwith excitement; he could not move, nor utter a word. She was there, in\r\nfront of him, at his mercy! What a victory over Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! And what\r\na revenge! And, at the same time, the victory was such an easy one that\r\nhe asked himself if the blonde Lady would not yet slip through his\r\nfingers by one of those miracles that usually terminated the exploits\r\nof Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. She remained standing near the door, surprised at the\r\nsilence, and looked about her without any display of suspicion or fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will get away! She will disappear!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ganimard.\r\n\r\nThen he managed to get between her and the door. She turned to go out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you going away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, monsieur, I do not understand what this means. Allow me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason why you should go, madame, and very good reasons\r\nwhy you should remain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless, madame. You cannot go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrembling, she sat on a chair, and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard had won the battle and captured the blonde Lady. He said to\r\nher:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to present the friend I mentioned, who desires to purchase\r\nsome diamonds. Have you procured the stones you promised to bring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! Jog your memory! A person of your acquaintance intended to send\r\nyou a tinted stone.... \xe2\x80\x98Something like the blue diamond,\xe2\x80\x99 I said,\r\nlaughing; and you replied: \xe2\x80\x98Exactly, I expect to have just what you\r\nwant.\xe2\x80\x99 Do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply. A small satchel fell from her hand. She picked it up\r\nquickly, and held it securely. Her hands trembled slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9cI see you have no confidence in us, Madame de\r\nR\xc3\xa9al. I shall set you a good example by showing you what I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took from his pocketbook a paper which he unfolded, and disclosed a\r\nlock of hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are a few hairs torn from the head of Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat by the\r\nBaron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, which I found clasped in his dead hand. I have shown\r\nthem to Mlle. Gerbois, who declares they are of the exact color of the\r\nhair of the blonde Lady. Besides, they are exactly the color of your\r\nhair\xe2\x80\x94the identical color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame R\xc3\xa9al looked at him in bewilderment, as if she did not understand\r\nhis meaning. He continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here are two perfume bottles, without labels, it is true, and\r\nempty, but still sufficiently impregnated with their odor to enable\r\nMlle. Gerbois to recognize in them the perfume used by that blonde Lady\r\nwho was her traveling companion for two weeks. Now, one of these\r\nbottles was found in the room that Madame de R\xc3\xa9al occupied at the\r\nCh\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon, and the other in the room that you occupied at the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel Beaurivage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?... The blonde Lady ... the Ch\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe detective did not reply. He took from his pocket and placed on the\r\ntable, side by side, four small sheets of paper. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, on these four pieces of paper, various specimens of\r\nhandwriting; the first is the writing of Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat; the second\r\nwas written by the woman who sent the note to Baron Herschmann at the\r\nauction sale of the blue diamond; the third is that of Madame de R\xc3\xa9al,\r\nwritten while she was stopping at the Ch\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon; and the fourth\r\nis your handwriting, madame ... it is your name and address, which you\r\ngave to the porter of the H\xc3\xb4tel Beaurivage at Trouville. Now, compare\r\nthe four handwritings. They are identical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat absurdity is this? really, monsieur, I do not understand. What\r\ndoes it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the blonde Lady, the\r\nfriend and accomplice of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, is none other than you, Madame\r\nR\xc3\xa9al.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard went to the adjoining room and returned with Mon. Gerbois,\r\nwhom he placed in front of Madame R\xc3\xa9al, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Gerbois, is this the person who abducted your daughter, the\r\nwoman you saw at the house of Monsieur Detinan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard was so surprised that he could not speak for a moment;\r\nfinally, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo?... You must be mistaken....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not mistaken. Madame is blonde, it is true, and in that respect\r\nresembles the blonde Lady; but, in all other respects, she is totally\r\ndifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. You must be mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard called in his other witnesses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you recognize Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, this is not the person I saw at my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman is not Madame de R\xc3\xa9al,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the Count de Crozon.\r\n\r\nThat was the finishing touch. Ganimard was crushed. He was buried\r\nbeneath the ruins of the structure he had erected with so much care and\r\nassurance. His pride was humbled, his spirit was broken, by the force\r\nof this unexpected blow.\r\n\r\nMon. Dudouis arose, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe owe you an apology, madame, for this unfortunate mistake. But,\r\nsince your arrival here, I have noticed your nervous agitation.\r\nSomething troubles you; may I ask what it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, monsieur, I was afraid. My satchel contains diamonds to the\r\nvalue of a hundred thousand francs, and the conduct of your friend was\r\nrather suspicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you were frequently absent from Paris. How do you explain that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make frequent journeys to other cities in the course of my business.\r\nThat is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Dudouis had nothing more to ask. He turned to his subordinate, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour investigation has been very superficial, Ganimard, and your\r\nconduct toward this lady is really deplorable. You will come to my\r\noffice to-morrow and explain it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe interview was at an end, and Mon. Dudouis was about to leave the\r\nroom when a most annoying incident occurred. Madame R\xc3\xa9al turned to\r\nGanimard, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand that you are Monsieur Ganimard. Am I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, this letter must be for you. I received it this morning. It was\r\naddressed to \xe2\x80\x98Mon. Justin Ganimard, care of Madame R\xc3\xa9al.\xe2\x80\x99 I thought it\r\nwas a joke, because I did not know you under that name, but it appears\r\nthat your unknown correspondent knew of our rendezvous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard was inclined to put the letter in his pocket unread, but he\r\ndared not do so in the presence of his superior, so he opened the\r\nenvelope and read the letter aloud, in an almost inaudible tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce upon a time, there were a blonde Lady, a Lupin, and a Ganimard.\r\nNow, the wicked Ganimard had evil designs on the pretty blonde Lady,\r\nand the good Lupin was her friend and protector. When the good Lupin\r\nwished the blonde Lady to become the friend of the Countess de Crozon,\r\nhe caused her to assume the name of Madame de R\xc3\xa9al, which is a close\r\nresemblance to the name of a certain diamond broker, a woman with a\r\npale complexion and golden hair. And the good Lupin said to himself: If\r\never the wicked Ganimard gets upon the track of the blonde Lady, how\r\nuseful it will be to me if he should be diverted to the track of the\r\nhonest diamond broker. A wise precaution that has borne good fruit. A\r\nlittle note sent to the newspaper read by the wicked Ganimard, a\r\nperfume bottle intentionally forgotten by the genuine blonde Lady at\r\nthe H\xc3\xb4tel Beaurivage, the name and address of Madame R\xc3\xa9al written on\r\nthe hotel register by the genuine blonde Lady, and the trick is played.\r\nWhat do you think of it, Ganimard? I wished to tell you the true story\r\nof this affair, knowing that you would be the first to laugh over it.\r\nReally, it is quite amusing, and I have enjoyed it very much.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAccept my best wishes, dear friend, and give my kind regards to\r\n    the worthy Mon. Dudouis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows everything,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Ganimard, but he did not see the humor\r\nof the situation as Lupin had predicted. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows some things I have\r\nnever mentioned to any one. How could he find out that I was going to\r\ninvite you here, chief? How could he know that I had found the first\r\nperfume bottle? How could he find out those things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stamped his feet and tore his hair\xe2\x80\x94a prey to the most tragic\r\ndespair. Mon. Dudouis felt sorry for him, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Ganimard, never mind; try to do better next time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mon. Dudouis left the room, accompanied by Madame R\xc3\xa9al.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next ten minutes, Ganimard read and re-read the letter of\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. Monsieur and Madame de Crozon, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec and\r\nMonsieur Gerbois were holding an animated discussion in a corner of the\r\nroom. At last, the count approached the detective, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear monsieur, after your investigation, we are no nearer the truth\r\nthan we were before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, but my investigation has established these facts: that the\r\nblonde Lady is the mysterious heroine of these exploits, and that\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin directed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose facts do not solve the mystery; in fact, they render it more\r\nobscure. The blonde Lady commits a murder in order to steal the blue\r\ndiamond, and yet she does not steal it. Afterward she steals it and\r\ngets rid of it by secretly giving it to another person. How do you\r\nexplain her strange conduct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot explain it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; but, perhaps, someone else can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Count hesitated, so the Countess replied, frankly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one man besides yourself who is competent to enter the\r\narena with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and overcome him. Have you any objection to our\r\nengaging the services of Herlock Sholmes in this case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard was vexed at the question, but stammered a reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ... but ... I do not understand what\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me explain. All this mystery annoys me. I wish to have it cleared\r\nup. Monsieur Gerbois and Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec have the same desire, and\r\nwe have agreed to send for the celebrated English detective.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the detective, with a loyalty that did\r\nhim credit, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right. Old Ganimard is not able to overcome Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin. But will Herlock Sholmes succeed? I hope so, as I have the\r\ngreatest admiration for him. But ... it is improbable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that he will not succeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my opinion. I can foresee the result of a duel between Herlock\r\nSholmes and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. The Englishman will be defeated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, in any event, can we count on your assistance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so, madame. I shall be pleased to render Monsieur Sholmes all\r\npossible assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know his address?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; 219 Parker street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat evening Monsieur and Madame de Crozon withdrew the charge they had\r\nmade against Herr Bleichen, and a joint letter was addressed to Herlock\r\nSholmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nHERLOCK SHOLMES OPENS HOSTILITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does monsieur wish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, like a man who never worries over the\r\ndetails of a meal; \xe2\x80\x9canything you like, but no meat or alcohol.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter walked away, disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! still a vegetarian?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore so than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough taste, faith, or habit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHygiene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you never fall from grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes ... when I am dining out ... and wish to avoid being\r\nconsidered eccentric.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were dining near the Northern Railway station, in a little\r\nrestaurant to which Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had invited me. Frequently he would\r\nsend me a telegram asking me to meet him in some obscure restaurant,\r\nwhere we could enjoy a quiet dinner, well served, and which was always\r\nmade interesting to me by his recital of some startling adventure\r\ntheretofore unknown to me.\r\n\r\nOn that particular evening he appeared to be in a more lively mood than\r\nusual. He laughed and joked with careless animation, and with that\r\ndelicate sarcasm that was habitual with him\xe2\x80\x94a light and spontaneous\r\nsarcasm that was quite free from any tinge of malice. It was a pleasure\r\nto find him in that jovial mood, and I could not resist the desire to\r\ntell him so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are days in which I find life as bright\r\nand gay as a spring morning; then life seems to be an infinite treasure\r\nwhich I can never exhaust. And yet God knows I lead a careless\r\nexistence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much so, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but I tell you, the treasure is infinite. I can spend it with a\r\nlavish hand. I can cast my youth and strength to the four winds of\r\nHeaven, and it is replaced by a still younger and greater force.\r\nBesides, my life is so pleasant!... If I wished to do so, I might\r\nbecome\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say?... An orator, a manufacturer, a politician....\r\nBut, I assure you, I shall never have such a desire. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, I\r\nam; Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, I shall remain. I have made a vain search in history\r\nto find a career comparable to mine; a life better filled or more\r\nintense.... Napoleon? Yes, perhaps.... But Napoleon, toward the close\r\nof his career, when all Europe was trying to crush him, asked himself\r\non the eve of each battle if it would not be his last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas he serious? Or was he joking? He became more animated as he\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is everything, do you understand, the danger! The continuous\r\nfeeling of danger! To breathe it as you breathe the air, to scent it in\r\nevery breath of wind, to detect it in every unusual sound.... And, in\r\nthe midst of the tempest, to remain calm ... and not to stumble!\r\nOtherwise, you are lost. There is only one sensation equal to it: that\r\nof the chauffeur in an automobile race. But that race lasts only a few\r\nhours; my race continues until death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fantasy!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you wish me to believe that you have\r\nno particular motive for your adoption of that exciting life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a clever psychologist. Work it\r\nout for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe poured himself a glass of water, drank it, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you read _\xe2\x80\x98Le Temps\xe2\x80\x99_ to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerlock Sholmes crossed the Channel this afternoon, and arrived in\r\nParis about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce! What is he coming for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little journey he has undertaken at the request of the Count and\r\nCountess of Crozon, Monsieur Gerbois, and the nephew of Baron\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec. They met him at the Northern Railway station, took him to\r\nmeet Ganimard, and, at this moment, the six of them are holding a\r\nconsultation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDespite a strong temptation to do so, I had never ventured to question\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin concerning any action of his private life, unless he had\r\nfirst mentioned the subject to me. Up to that moment his name had not\r\nbeen mentioned, at least officially, in connection with the blue\r\ndiamond. Consequently, I consumed my curiosity in patience. He\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is also in _\xe2\x80\x98Le Temps\xe2\x80\x99_ an interview with my old friend\r\nGanimard, according to whom a certain blonde lady, who should be my\r\nfriend, must have murdered the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec and tried to rob Madame\r\nde Crozon of her famous ring. And\xe2\x80\x94what do you think?\xe2\x80\x94he accuses me of\r\nbeing the instigator of those crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not suppress a slight shudder. Was this true? Must I believe\r\nthat his career of theft, his mode of existence, the logical result of\r\nsuch a life, had drawn that man into more serious crimes, including\r\nmurder? I looked at him. He was so calm, and his eyes had such a frank\r\nexpression! I observed his hands: they had been formed from a model of\r\nexceeding delicacy, long and slender; inoffensive, truly; and the hands\r\nof an artist....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGanimard has pipe-dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d protested Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cGanimard has some cleverness; and, at\r\ntimes, almost inspiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInspiration!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. For instance, that interview is a master-stroke. In the first\r\nplace, he announces the coming of his English rival in order to put me\r\non my guard, and make his task more difficult. In the second place, he\r\nindicates the exact point to which he has conducted the affair in order\r\nthat Sholmes will not get credit for the work already done by Ganimard.\r\nThat is good warfare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever it may be, you have two adversaries to deal with, and such\r\nadversaries!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! one of them doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSholmes? Oh! I confess he is a worthy foe; and that explains my\r\npresent good humor. In the first place, it is a question of\r\nself-esteem; I am pleased to know that they consider me a subject\r\nworthy the attention of the celebrated English detective. In the next\r\nplace, just imagine the pleasure a man, such as I, must experience in\r\nthe thought of a duel with Herlock Sholmes. But I shall be obliged to\r\nstrain every muscle; he is a clever fellow, and will contest every inch\r\nof the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you consider him a strong opponent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. As a detective, I believe, he has never had an equal. But I have\r\none advantage over him; he is making the attack and I am simply\r\ndefending myself. My r\xc3\xb4le is the easier one. Besides, I am familiar\r\nwith his method of warfare, and he does not know mine. I am prepared to\r\nshow him a few new tricks that will give him something to think about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tapped the table with his fingers as he uttered the following\r\nsentences, with an air of keen delight:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin against Herlock Sholmes.... France against England....\r\nTrafalgar will be revenged at last.... Ah! the rascal ... he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuspect that I am prepared ... and a Lupin warned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly, seized with a fit of coughing, and hid his face in\r\nhis napkin, as if something had stuck in his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bit of bread?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cDrink some water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, in a stifled voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe want of air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish a window opened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shall go out. Give me my hat and overcoat, quick! I must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two gentlemen who came in just now.... Look at the taller one ...\r\nnow, when we go out, keep to my left, so he will not see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one who is sitting behind you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I will explain it to you, outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerlock Sholmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a desperate effort to control himself, as if he were ashamed of\r\nhis emotion, replaced his napkin, drank a glass of water, and, quite\r\nrecovered, said to me, smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is strange, hein, that I should be affected so easily, but that\r\nunexpected sight\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to fear, since no one can recognize you, on account of\r\nyour many transformations? Every time I see you it seems to me your\r\nface is changed; it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all familiar. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _he_ would recognize me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has seen me only once;\r\nbut, at that time, he made a mental photograph of me\xe2\x80\x94not of my external\r\nappearance but of my very soul\xe2\x80\x94not what I appear to be but just what I\r\nam. Do you understand? And then ... and then.... I did not expect to\r\nmeet him here.... Such a strange encounter!... in this little\r\nrestaurant....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, shall we go out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better way is to act frankly ... to have confidence in him\xe2\x80\x94trust\r\nhim....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not speak to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? It will be to my advantage to do so, and find out what he\r\nknows, and, perhaps, what he thinks. At present I have the feeling that\r\nhis gaze is on my neck and shoulders, and that he is trying to remember\r\nwhere he has seen them before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reflected a moment. I observed a malicious smile at the corner of\r\nhis mouth; then, obedient, I think, to a whim of his impulsive nature,\r\nand not to the necessities of the situation, he arose, turned around,\r\nand, with a bow and a joyous air, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what lucky chance? Ah! I am delighted to see you. Permit me to\r\nintroduce a friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment the Englishman was disconcerted; then he made a movement\r\nas if he would seize Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. The latter shook his head, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would not be fair; besides, the movement would be an awkward one\r\nand ... quite useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman looked about him, as if in search of assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, are you quite sure you can place your\r\nhand on me? Come, now, show me that you are a real Englishman and,\r\ntherefore, a good sport.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis advice seemed to commend itself to the detective, for he partially\r\nrose and said, very formally:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Wilson, my friend and assistant\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson\xe2\x80\x99s amazement evoked a laugh. With bulging eyes and gaping mouth,\r\nhe looked from one to the other, as if unable to comprehend the\r\nsituation. Herlock Sholmes laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, you should conceal your astonishment at an incident which is\r\none of the most natural in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not arrest him?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not observed, Wilson, that the gentleman is between me and\r\nthe door, and only a few steps from the door. By the time I could move\r\nmy little finger he would be outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let that make any difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, who now walked around\r\nthe table and seated himself so that the Englishman was between him and\r\nthe door\xe2\x80\x94thus placing himself at the mercy of the foreigner.\r\n\r\nWilson looked at Sholmes to find out if he had the right to admire this\r\nact of wanton courage. The Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s face was impenetrable; but, a\r\nmoment later, he called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter came he ordered soda, beer and whisky. The treaty of\r\npeace was signed\xe2\x80\x94until further orders. In a few moments the four men\r\nwere conversing in an apparently friendly manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes is a man such as you might meet every day in the\r\nbusiness world. He is about fifty years of age, and looks as if he\r\nmight have passed his life in an office, adding up columns of dull\r\nfigures or writing out formal statements of business accounts. There\r\nwas nothing to distinguish him from the average citizen of London,\r\nexcept the appearance of his eyes, his terribly keen and penetrating\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nBut then he is Herlock Sholmes\xe2\x80\x94which means that he is a wonderful\r\ncombination of intuition, observation, clairvoyance and ingenuity. One\r\ncould readily believe that nature had been pleased to take the two most\r\nextraordinary detectives that the imagination of man has hitherto\r\nconceived, the Dupin of Edgar Allen Poe and the Lecoq of Emile\r\nGaboriau, and, out of that material, constructed a new detective, more\r\nextraordinary and supernatural than either of them. And when a person\r\nreads the history of his exploits, which have made him famous\r\nthroughout the entire world, he asks himself whether Herlock Sholmes is\r\nnot a mythical personage, a fictitious hero born in the brain of a\r\ngreat novelist\xe2\x80\x94Conan Doyle, for instance.\r\n\r\nWhen Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin questioned him in regard to the length of his sojourn\r\nin France he turned the conversation into its proper channel by saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends on you, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lupin, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cif it depends on me you can return to\r\nEngland to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a little too soon, but I expect to return in the course of\r\neight or nine days\xe2\x80\x94ten at the outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in such a hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have many cases to attend to; such as the robbery of the\r\nAnglo-Chinese Bank, the abduction of Lady Eccleston.... But, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink, Monsieur Lupin, that I can finish my business in Paris within a\r\nweek?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, if you confine your efforts to the case of the blue\r\ndiamond. It is, moreover, the length of time that I require to make\r\npreparations for my safety in case the solution of that affair should\r\ngive you certain dangerous advantages over me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman, \xe2\x80\x9cI expect to close the business in\r\neight or ten days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd arrest me on the eleventh, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the tenth is my limit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin shook his head thoughtfully, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be difficult\xe2\x80\x94very difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDifficult, perhaps, but possible, therefore certain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely certain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson, as if he had clearly worked out the\r\nlong series of operations which would conduct his collaborator to the\r\ndesired result.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herlock Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not hold all the trump cards,\r\nas these cases are already several months old, and I lack certain\r\ninformation and clues upon which I am accustomed to base my\r\ninvestigations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch as spots of mud and cigarette ashes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson, with an air of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to the remarkable conclusions formed by Monsieur Ganimard,\r\nI have obtained all the articles written on the subject, and have\r\nformed a few deductions of my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome ideas which were suggested to us by analysis or hypothesis,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Wilson, sententiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to enquire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, in that deferential tone which\r\nhe employed in speaking to Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cwould I be indiscreet if I were to\r\nask you what opinion you have formed about the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReally, it was a most exciting situation to see those two men facing\r\neach other across the table, engaged in an earnest discussion as if\r\nthey were obliged to solve some abstruse problem or come to an\r\nagreement upon some controverted fact. Wilson was in the seventh heaven\r\nof delight. Herlock Sholmes filled his pipe slowly, lighted it, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis affair is much simpler than it appeared to be at first sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch simpler,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson, as a faithful echo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say \xe2\x80\x98this affair,\xe2\x80\x99 for, in my opinion, there is only one,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe death of the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, the story of the ring, and,\r\nlet us not forget, the mystery of lottery ticket number 514, are only\r\ndifferent phases of what one might call the mystery of the blonde Lady.\r\nNow, according to my view, it is simply a question of discovering the\r\nbond that unites those three episodes in the same story\xe2\x80\x94the fact which\r\nproves the unity of the three events. Ganimard, whose judgment is\r\nrather superficial, finds that unity in the faculty of disappearance;\r\nthat is, in the power of coming and going unseen and unheard. That\r\ntheory does not satisfy me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is your idea?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe characteristic feature of the three\r\nepisodes is your design and purpose of leading the affair into a\r\ncertain channel previously chosen by you. It is, on your part, more\r\nthan a plan; it is a necessity, an indispensable condition of success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you furnish any details of your theory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. For example, from the beginning of your conflict with\r\nMonsieur Gerbois, is it not evident that the apartment of Monsieur\r\nDetinan is the place selected by you, the inevitable spot where all the\r\nparties must meet? In your opinion, it was the only safe place, and you\r\narranged a rendezvous there, publicly, one might say, for the blonde\r\nLady and Mademoiselle Gerbois.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe professor\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d added Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, let us consider the case of the blue diamond. Did you try to\r\nappropriate it while the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec possessed it? No. But the\r\nbaron takes his brother\xe2\x80\x99s house. Six months later we have the\r\nintervention of Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat and the first attempt. The diamond\r\nescapes you, and the sale is widely advertised to take place at the\r\nDrouot auction-rooms. Will it be a free and open sale? Is the richest\r\namateur sure to carry off the jewel? No. Just as the banker Herschmann\r\nis on the point of buying the ring, a lady sends him a letter of\r\nwarning, and it is the Countess de Crozon, prepared and influenced by\r\nthe same lady, who becomes the purchaser of the diamond. Will the ring\r\ndisappear at once? No; you lack the opportunity. Therefore, you must\r\nwait. At last the Countess goes to her ch\xc3\xa2teau. That is what you were\r\nwaiting for. The ring disappears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo reappear again in the tooth-powder of Herr Bleichen,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\nLupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! such nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, striking the table with his\r\nfist, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me such a fairy tale. I am too old a fox to be led\r\naway by a false scent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, then paused a moment as if he wished to\r\narrange his effect. At last he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blue diamond that was found in the tooth-powder was false. You\r\nkept the genuine stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin remained silent for a moment; then, with his eyes fixed on\r\nthe Englishman, he replied, calmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are impertinent, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpertinent, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Wilson, beaming with admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, \xe2\x80\x9cand, yet, to do you credit, you have thrown a\r\nstrong light on a very mysterious subject. Not a magistrate, not a\r\nspecial reporter, who has been engaged on this case, has come so near\r\nthe truth. It is a marvellous display of intuition and logic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! a person has simply to use his brains,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herlock Sholmes,\r\nnattered at the homage of the expert criminal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so few have any brains to use,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, now, that the\r\nfield of conjectures has been narrowed down, and the rubbish cleared\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, I have simply to discover why the three episodes were\r\nenacted at 25 rue Clapeyron, 134 avenue Henri-Martin, and within the\r\nwalls of the Ch\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon and my work will be finished. What\r\nremains will be child\xe2\x80\x99s play. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think you are right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, Monsieur Lupin, am I wrong in saying that my business\r\nwill be finished in ten days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn ten days you will know the whole truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will be arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order that I may be arrested there must occur such a series of\r\nimprobable and unexpected misfortunes that I cannot admit the\r\npossibility of such an event.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a saying in England that \xe2\x80\x98the unexpected always happens.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other for a moment calmly and fearlessly, without\r\nany display of bravado or malice. They met as equals in a contest of\r\nwit and skill. And this meeting was the formal crossing of swords,\r\npreliminary to the duel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lupin, \xe2\x80\x9cat last I shall have an adversary worthy of the\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94one whose defeat will be the proudest achievement in my career.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost, Monsieur Wilson,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lupin, rising from his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthe proof is that I am about to make a hasty retreat. Then, we will say\r\nten days, Monsieur Sholmes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ten days. This is Sunday. A week from next Wednesday, at eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, it will be all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall be in prison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! not a pleasant outlook for a man who gets so much enjoyment out of\r\nlife as I do. No cares, a lively interest in the affairs of the world,\r\na justifiable contempt for the police, and the consoling sympathy of\r\nnumerous friends and admirers. And now, behold, all that is about to be\r\nchanged! It is the reverse side of the medal. After sunshine comes the\r\nrain. It is no longer a laughing matter. Adieu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson, full of solicitude for a person in whom\r\nHerlock Sholmes had inspired so much respect, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not lose a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a minute, Monsieur Wilson; but I wish to express my pleasure at\r\nhaving met you, and to tell you how much I envy the master in having\r\nsuch a valuable assistant as you seem to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, after they had courteously saluted each other, like adversaries\r\nin a duel who entertain no feeling of malice but are obliged to fight\r\nby force of circumstances, Lupin seized me by the arm and drew me\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of it, dear boy? The strange events of this evening\r\nwill form an interesting chapter in the memoirs you are now preparing\r\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe closed the door of the restaurant behind us, and, after taking a few\r\nsteps, he stopped and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you smoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Nor do you, it seems to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lighted a cigarette with a wax-match, which he shook several times\r\nin an effort to extinguish it. But he threw away the cigarette\r\nimmediately, ran across the street, and joined two men who emerged from\r\nthe shadows as if called by a signal. He conversed with them for a few\r\nminutes on the opposite sidewalk, and then returned to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, but I fear that cursed Sholmes is going to give me\r\ntrouble. But, I assure you, he is not yet through with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. He\r\nwill find out what kind of fuel I use to warm my blood. And now\xe2\x80\x94au\r\nrevoir! The genial Wilson is right; there is not a moment to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked away rapidly.\r\n\r\nThus ended the events of that exciting evening, or, at least, that part\r\nof them in which I was a participant. Subsequently, during the course\r\nof the evening, other stirring incidents occurred which have come to my\r\nknowledge through the courtesy of other members of that unique\r\ndinner-party.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the very moment in which Lupin left me, Herlock Sholmes rose from\r\nthe table, and looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty minutes to nine. At nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock I am to meet the Count and\r\nCountess at the railway station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, we must be off!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wilson, between two drinks of whisky.\r\n\r\nThey left the restaurant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, don\xe2\x80\x99t look behind. We may be followed, and, in that case, let\r\nus act as if we did not care. Wilson, I want your opinion: why was\r\nLupin in that restaurant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get something to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wilson, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, I must congratulate you on the accuracy of your deduction. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done better myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson blushed with pleasure, and Sholmes continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get something to eat. Very well, and, after that, probably, to\r\nassure himself whether I am going to the Ch\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon, as\r\nannounced by Ganimard in his interview. I must go in order not to\r\ndisappoint him. But, in order to gain time on him, I shall not go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson, nonplused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, my friend, will walk down this street, take a carriage, two,\r\nthree carriages. Return later and get the valises that we left at the\r\nstation, and make for the Elys\xc3\xa9e-Palace at a galop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I reach the Elys\xc3\xa9e-Palace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEngage a room, go to sleep, and await my orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite proud of the important r\xc3\xb4le assigned to him, Wilson set out to\r\nperform his task. Herlock Sholmes proceeded to the railway station,\r\nbought a ticket, and repaired to the Amiens\xe2\x80\x99 express in which the Count\r\nand Countess de Crozon were already installed. He bowed to them,\r\nlighted his pipe, and had a quiet smoke in the corridor. The train\r\nstarted. Ten minutes later he took a seat beside the Countess, and said\r\nto her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you the ring here, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you kindly let me see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took it, and examined it closely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as I suspected: it is a manufactured diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA manufactured diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a new process which consists in submitting diamond dust to a\r\ntremendous heat until it melts and is then molded into a single stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my diamond is genuine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, _your_ diamond is; but this is not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is held by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this stone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas substituted for yours, and slipped into Herr Bleichen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntooth-powder, where it was afterwards found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you think this is false?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely false.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Countess was overwhelmed with surprise and grief, while her husband\r\nscrutinized the diamond with an incredulous air. Finally she stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible? And why did they not merely steal it and be done with\r\nit? And how did they steal it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly what I am going to find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Ch\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I shall leave the train at Creil and return to Paris. It is there\r\nthe game between me and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin must be played. In fact, the game\r\nhas commenced already, and Lupin thinks I am on my way to the ch\xc3\xa2teau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter to you, madame? The essential thing is your\r\ndiamond, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. I have just undertaken a much more difficult task\r\nthan that. You have my promise that I will restore the true diamond to\r\nyou within ten days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train slackened its speed. He put the false diamond in his pocket\r\nand opened the door. The Count cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the wrong side of the train. You are getting out on the\r\ntracks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my intention. If Lupin has anyone on my track, he will lose\r\nsight of me now. Adieu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn employee protested in vain. After the departure of the train, the\r\nEnglishman sought the station-master\xe2\x80\x99s office. Forty minutes later he\r\nleaped into a train that landed him in Paris shortly before midnight.\r\nHe ran across the platform, entered the lunch-room, made his exit at\r\nanother door, and jumped into a cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDriver\xe2\x80\x94rue Clapeyron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving reached the conclusion that he was not followed, he stopped the\r\ncarriage at the end of the street, and proceeded to make a careful\r\nexamination of Monsieur Detinan\xe2\x80\x99s house and the two adjoining houses.\r\nHe made measurements of certain distances and entered the figures in\r\nhis notebook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDriver\xe2\x80\x94avenue Henri-Martin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the avenue and the rue de la Pompe, he dismissed the\r\ncarriage, walked down the street to number 134, and performed the same\r\noperations in front of the house of the late Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec and the\r\ntwo adjoining houses, measuring the width of the respective fa\xc3\xa7ades and\r\ncalculating the depth of the little gardens that stood in front of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe avenue was deserted, and was very dark under its four rows of\r\ntrees, between which, at considerable intervals, a few gas-lamps\r\nstruggled in vain to light the deep shadows. One of them threw a dim\r\nlight over a portion of the house, and Sholmes perceived the \xe2\x80\x9cTo-let\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsign posted on the gate, the neglected walks which encircled the small\r\nlawn, and the large bare windows of the vacant house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthe house has been unoccupied since\r\nthe death of the baron.... Ah! if I could only get in and view the\r\nscene of the murder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the idea occur to him than he sought to put it in\r\nexecution. But how could he manage it? He could not climb over the\r\ngate; it was too high. So he took from his pocket an electric lantern\r\nand a skeleton key which he always carried. Then, to his great\r\nsurprise, he discovered that the gate was not locked; in fact, it was\r\nopen about three or four inches. He entered the garden, and was careful\r\nto leave the gate as he had found it\xe2\x80\x94partly open. But he had not taken\r\nmany steps from the gate when he stopped. He had seen a light pass one\r\nof the windows on the second floor.\r\n\r\nHe saw the light pass a second window and a third, but he saw nothing\r\nelse, except a silhouette outlined on the walls of the rooms. The light\r\ndescended to the first floor, and, for a long time, wandered from room\r\nto room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the deuce is walking, at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, through the\r\nhouse in which the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec was killed?\xe2\x80\x9d Herlock Sholmes asked\r\nhimself, deeply interested.\r\n\r\nThere was only one way to find out, and that was to enter the house\r\nhimself. He did not hesitate, but started for the door of the house.\r\nHowever, at the moment when he crossed the streak of gaslight that came\r\nfrom the street-lamp, the man must have seen him, for the light in the\r\nhouse was suddenly extinguished and Herlock Sholmes did not see it\r\nagain. Softly, he tried the door. It was open, also. Hearing no sound,\r\nhe advanced through the hallway, encountered the foot of the stairs,\r\nand ascended to the first floor. Here there was the same silence, the\r\nsame darkness.\r\n\r\nHe entered, one of the rooms and approached a window through which came\r\na feeble light from the outside. On looking through the window he saw\r\nthe man, who had no doubt descended by another stairway and escaped by\r\nanother door. The man was threading his way through the shrubbery which\r\nbordered the wall that separated the two gardens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9che is going to escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hastened down the stairs and leaped over the steps in his eagerness\r\nto cut off the man\xe2\x80\x99s retreat. But he did not see anyone, and, owing to\r\nthe darkness, it was several seconds before he was able to distinguish\r\na bulky form moving through the shrubbery. This gave the Englishman\r\nfood for reflection. Why had the man not made his escape, which he\r\ncould have done so easily? Had he remained in order to watch the\r\nmovements of the intruder who had disturbed him in his mysterious work?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not Lupin; he would be more\r\nadroit. It may be one of his men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor several minutes Herlock Sholmes remained motionless, with his gaze\r\nfixed on the adversary who, in his turn was watching the detective. But\r\nas that adversary had become passive, and as the Englishman was not one\r\nto consume his time in idle waiting, he examined his revolver to see if\r\nit was in good working order, remove his knife from its sheath, and\r\nwalked toward the enemy with that cool effrontery and scorn of danger\r\nfor which he had become famous.\r\n\r\nHe heard a clicking sound; it was his adversary preparing his revolver.\r\nHerlock Sholmes dashed boldly into the thicket, and grappled with his\r\nfoe. There was a sharp, desperate struggle, in the course of which\r\nSholmes suspected that the man was trying to draw a knife. But the\r\nEnglishman, believing his antagonist to be an accomplice of Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin and anxious to win the first trick in the game with that\r\nredoubtable foe, fought with unusual strength and determination. He\r\nhurled his adversary to the ground, held him there with the weight of\r\nhis body, and, gripping him by the throat with one hand, he used his\r\nfree hand to take out his electric lantern, press the button, and throw\r\nthe light over the face of his prisoner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerlock Sholmes!\xe2\x80\x9d stammered a weak, stifled voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time they remained silent, astounded, foolish. The shriek of\r\nan automobile rent the air. A slight breeze stirred the leaves.\r\nSuddenly, Herlock Sholmes seized his friend by the shoulders and shook\r\nhim violently, as he cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here? Tell me.... What?... Did I tell you to hide\r\nin the bushes and spy on me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpy on you!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Wilson, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you doing here? You ought to be in bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what brought you here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy letter? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a messenger brought it to me at the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom me? Are you crazy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true\xe2\x80\x94I swear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson handed him a sheet of paper, which he read by the light of his\r\nlantern. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, come at once to avenue Henri-Martin. The house is empty.\r\nInspect the whole place and make an exact plan. Then return to\r\nhotel.\xe2\x80\x94Herlock Sholmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was measuring the rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I saw a shadow in the\r\ngarden. I had only one idea\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was to seize the shadow.... The idea was excellent.... But\r\nremember this, Wilson, whenever you receive a letter from me, be sure\r\nit is my handwriting and not a forgery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wilson, as the truth dawned on him, \xe2\x80\x9cthen the letter\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho sent it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? For what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what worries me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why he\r\ntook the trouble to disturb you. Of course, if he had sent me on such a\r\nfoolish errand I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised; but what was his object in\r\ndisturbing you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must hurry back to the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo must I, Wilson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the gate. Wilson, who was ahead, took hold of it and\r\npulled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you closed it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I left it partly open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes tried the gate; then, alarmed, he examined the lock. An oath\r\nescaped him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! it is locked! locked with a key!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook the gate with all his strength; then, realizing the futility\r\nof his efforts, he dropped his arms, discouraged, and muttered, in a\r\njerky manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see it all now\xe2\x80\x94it is Lupin. He foresaw that I would leave the\r\ntrain at Creil, and he prepared this neat little trap for me in case I\r\nshould commence my investigation this evening. Moreover, he was kind\r\nenough to send me a companion to share my captivity. All done to make\r\nme lose a day, and, perhaps, also, to teach me to mind my own\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say we are prisoners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. Herlock Sholmes and Wilson are the prisoners of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bad beginning; but he laughs best who laughs last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson seized Sholmes\xe2\x80\x99 arm, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!... Look up there!... A light....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA light shone through one of the windows of the first floor. Both of\r\nthem ran to the house, and each ascended by the stairs he had used on\r\ncoming out a short time before, and they met again at the entrance to\r\nthe lighted chamber. A small piece of a candle was burning in the\r\ncenter of the room. Beside it there was a basket containing a bottle, a\r\nroasted chicken, and a loaf of bread.\r\n\r\nSholmes was greatly amused, and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful! we are invited to supper. It is really an enchanted place,\r\na genuine fairy-land. Come, Wilson, cheer up! this is not a funeral.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very funny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure it is so very funny?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wilson, in a lugubrious\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I sure?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, with a gaiety that was too boisterous\r\nto be natural, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, to tell the truth, it\xe2\x80\x99s the funniest thing I ever\r\nsaw. It\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly good comedy! What a master of sarcasm this Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin is! He makes a fool of you with the utmost grace and delicacy. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss this feast for all the money in the Bank of England.\r\nCome, Wilson, you grieve me. You should display that nobility of\r\ncharacter which rises superior to misfortune. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that you have\r\nany cause for complaint, really, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a time, by dint of good humor and sarcasm, he managed to restore\r\nWilson to his normal mood, and make him swallow a morsel of chicken and\r\na glass of wine. But when the candle went out and they prepared to\r\nspend the night there, with the bare floor for a mattress and the hard\r\nwall for a pillow, the harsh and ridiculous side of the situation was\r\nimpressed upon them. That particular incident will not form a pleasant\r\npage in the memoirs of the famous detective.\r\n\r\nNext morning Wilson awoke, stiff and cold. A slight noise attracted his\r\nattention: Herlock Sholmes was kneeling on the floor, critically\r\nexamining some grains of sand and studying some chalk-marks, now almost\r\neffaced, which formed certain figures and numbers, which figures he\r\nentered in his notebook.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Wilson, who was deeply interested in the work, he\r\nexamined each room, and found similar chalk-marks in two other\r\napartments. He noticed, also, two circles on the oaken panels, an arrow\r\non a wainscot, and four figures on four steps of the stairs. At the end\r\nof an hour Wilson said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe figures are correct, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but, at all events, they mean something,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nSholmes, who had forgotten the discomforts of the night in the joy\r\ncreated by his new discoveries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite obvious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson, \xe2\x80\x9cthey represent the number of\r\npieces in the floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And the two circles indicate that the panels are false, as you\r\ncan readily ascertain, and the arrow points in the direction in which\r\nthe panels move.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes looked at Wilson, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear friend, how do you know all that? Your clairvoyance makes\r\nmy poor ability in that direction look quite insignificant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is very simple,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson, inflated with pride; \xe2\x80\x9cI examined\r\nthose marks last night, according to your instructions, or, rather,\r\naccording to the instructions of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, since he wrote the\r\nletter you sent to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment Wilson faced a greater danger than he had during his\r\nstruggle in the garden with Herlock Sholmes. The latter now felt a\r\nfurious desire to strangle him. But, dominating his feelings, Sholmes\r\nmade a grimace which was intended for a smile, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so, Wilson, you have done well, and your work shows commendable\r\nprogress. But, tell me, have you exercised your powers of observation\r\nand analysis on any other points? I might profit by your deductions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, I went no farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pity. Your d\xc3\xa9but was such a promising one. But, since that is\r\nall, we may as well go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo! but how can we get out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way all honest people go out: through the gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is locked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be opened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease call the two policemen who are strolling down the avenue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very humiliating. What will be said when it becomes known that\r\nHerlock Sholmes and Wilson were the prisoners of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I understand they will roar with laughter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herlock\r\nSholmes, in a dry voice and with frowning features, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we can\xe2\x80\x99t set\r\nup housekeeping in this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will not try to find another way out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the man who brought us the basket of provisions did not cross the\r\ngarden, coming or going. There is some other way out. Let us look for\r\nit, and not bother with the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour argument is sound, but you forget that all the detectives in\r\nParis have been trying to find it for the last six months, and that I\r\nsearched the house from top to bottom while you were asleep. Ah! my\r\ndear Wilson, we have not been accustomed to pursue such game as Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin. He leaves no trail behind him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Herlock Sholmes and Wilson were liberated, and\r\nconducted to the nearest police station, where the commissary, after\r\nsubjecting them to a severe examination, released them with an\r\naffectation of good-will that was quite exasperating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry, messieurs, that this unfortunate incident has\r\noccurred. You will have a very poor opinion of French hospitality. Mon\r\nDieu! what a night you must have passed! Ah! that rascally Lupin is no\r\nrespecter of persons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey took a carriage to their hotel. At the office Wilson asked for the\r\nkey of his room.\r\n\r\nAfter some search the clerk replied, much astonished:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, monsieur, you have given up the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave it up? When?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning, by the letter your friend brought here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman who brought your letter.... Ah! your card is still\r\nattached to the letter. Here they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson looked at them. Certainly, it was one of his cards, and the\r\nletter was in his handwriting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is another of his tricks,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nadded, aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my luggage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend took it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!... and you gave it to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; on the strength of your letter and card.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course ... of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey left the hotel and walked, slowly and thoughtfully, through the\r\nChamps-Elys\xc3\xa9es. The avenue was bright and cheerful beneath a clear\r\nautumn sun; the air was mild and pleasant.\r\n\r\nAt Rond-Point, Herlock Sholmes lighted his pipe. Then Wilson spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, Sholmes. You are so calm and unruffled. They\r\nplay with you as a cat plays with a mouse, and yet you do not say a\r\nword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes stopped, as he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, I was thinking of your card.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe point is this: here is a man who, in view of a possible struggle\r\nwith us, procures specimens of our handwriting, and who holds, in his\r\npossession, one or more of your cards. Now, have you considered how\r\nmuch precaution and skill those facts represent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Wilson, to overcome an enemy so well prepared and so thoroughly\r\nequipped requires the infinite shrewdness of ... of a Herlock Sholmes.\r\nAnd yet, as you have seen, Wilson, I have lost the first round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock the _Echo de France_ published the following article in\r\nits evening edition:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning Mon. Thenard, commissary of police in the sixteenth\r\ndistrict, released Herlock Sholmes and his friend Wilson, both of whom\r\nhad been locked in the house of the late Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, where they\r\nspent a very pleasant night\xe2\x80\x94thanks to the thoughtful care and attention\r\nof Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to their other troubles, these gentlemen have been robbed\r\nof their valises, and, in consequence thereof, they have entered a\r\nformal complaint against Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, satisfied that he has given them a mild reproof, hopes\r\nthese gentlemen will not force him to resort to more stringent\r\nmeasures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Herlock Sholmes, crushing the paper in his hands,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat is only child\xe2\x80\x99s play! And that is the only criticism I have to\r\nmake of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin: he plays to the gallery. There is that much of\r\nthe fakir in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Sholmes, you are a wonderful man! You have such a command over\r\nyour temper. Nothing ever disturbs you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing disturbs me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sholmes, in a voice that trembled\r\nfrom rage; \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of losing my temper?... I am quite\r\nconfident of the final result; I shall have the last word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nLIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever well-tempered a man\xe2\x80\x99s character may be\xe2\x80\x94and Herlock Sholmes is\r\none of those men over whom ill-fortune has little or no hold\xe2\x80\x94there are\r\ncircumstances wherein the most courageous combatant feels the necessity\r\nof marshaling his forces before risking the chances of a battle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take a vacation to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Wilson\xe2\x80\x94let me see! You can buy some underwear and linen to\r\nreplenish our wardrobe, while I take a rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Sholmes, I will watch while you sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson uttered these words with all the importance of a sentinel on\r\nguard at the outpost, and therefore exposed to the greatest danger. His\r\nchest was expanded; his muscles were tense. Assuming a shrewd look, he\r\nscrutinized, officially, the little room in which they had fixed their\r\nabode.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Wilson, you can watch. I shall occupy myself in the\r\npreparation of a line of attack more appropriate to the methods of the\r\nenemy we are called upon to meet. Do you see, Wilson, we have been\r\ndeceived in this fellow Lupin. My opinion is that we must commence at\r\nthe very beginning of this affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even before that, if possible. But have we sufficient time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine days, dear boy. That is five too many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman spent the entire afternoon in smoking and sleeping. He\r\ndid not enter upon his new plan of attack until the following day. Then\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, I am ready. Let us attack the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLead on, Macduff!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wilson, full of martial ardor. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to\r\nfight in the front rank. Oh! have no fear. I shall do credit to my King\r\nand country, for I am an Englishman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Sholmes had three long and important interviews:\r\nWith Monsieur Detinan, whose rooms he examined with the greatest care\r\nand precision; with Suzanne Gerbois, whom he questioned in regard to\r\nthe blonde Lady; and with Sister Auguste, who had retired to the\r\nconvent of the Visitandines since the murder of Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec.\r\n\r\nAt each of these interviews Wilson had remained outside; and each time\r\nhe asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSatisfactory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sure we were on the right track.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey paid a visit to the two houses adjoining that of the late Baron\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec in the avenue Henri-Martin; then they visited the rue\r\nClapeyron, and, while he was examining the front of number 25, Sholmes\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these houses must be connected by secret passages, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life, Wilson doubted the omnipotence of his\r\nfamous associate. Why did he now talk so much and accomplish so little?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, in answer to Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s secret thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause, with this fellow Lupin, a person has to work in the dark,\r\nand, instead of deducting the truth from established facts, a man must\r\nextract it from his own brain, and afterward learn if it is supported\r\nby the facts in the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about the secret passages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must exist. But even though I should discover them, and thus\r\nlearn how Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin made his entrance to the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s house and how\r\nthe blonde Lady escaped from the house of Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec after the\r\nmurder, what good would it do? How would it help me? Would it furnish\r\nme with a weapon of attack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us attack him just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wilson, who had scarcely\r\nuttered these words when he jumped back with a cry of alarm. Something\r\nhad fallen at their feet; it was a bag filled with sand which might\r\nhave caused them serious injury if it had struck them.\r\n\r\nSholmes looked up. Some men were working on a scaffolding attached to\r\nthe balcony at the fifth floor of the house. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were lucky; one step more, and that heavy bag would have fallen on\r\nour heads. I wonder if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMoved by a sudden impulse, he rushed into the house, up the five\r\nflights of stairs, rang the bell, pushed his way into the apartment to\r\nthe great surprise and alarm of the servant who came to the door, and\r\nmade his way to the balcony in front of the house. But there was no one\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the workmen who were here a moment ago?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have just gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way did they go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the servants\xe2\x80\x99 stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes leaned out of the window. He saw two men leaving the house,\r\ncarrying bicycles. They mounted them and quickly disappeared around the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have they been working on this scaffolding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose men?... only since this morning. It\xe2\x80\x99s their first day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes returned to the street, and joined Wilson. Together they\r\nreturned to the hotel, and thus the second day ended in a mournful\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nOn the following day their programme was almost similar. They sat\r\ntogether on a bench in the avenue Henri-Martin, much to Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisgust, who did not find it amusing to spend long hours watching the\r\nhouse in which the tragedy had occurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you expect, Sholmes? That Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin will walk out of the\r\nhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the blonde Lady will make her appearance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am looking for something to occur; some slight incident that will\r\nfurnish me with a clue to work on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it does not occur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I must, myself, create the spark that will set fire to the\r\npowder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA solitary incident\xe2\x80\x94and that of a disagreeable nature\xe2\x80\x94broke the\r\nmonotony of the forenoon.\r\n\r\nA gentleman was riding along the avenue when his horse suddenly turned\r\naside in such a manner that it ran against the bench on which they were\r\nsitting, and struck Sholmes a slight blow on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9ca little more and I would have had a broken\r\nshoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman struggled with his horse. The Englishman drew his\r\nrevolver and pointed it; but Wilson seized his arm, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be foolish! What are you going to do? Kill the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone, Wilson! Let go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the brief struggle between Sholmes and Wilson the stranger rode\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you can shoot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson, triumphantly, when the horseman was\r\nat some distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, you\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand that the man is an\r\naccomplice of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes was trembling from rage. Wilson stammered pitifully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!... that man ... an accomplice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the same as the workmen who tried to drop the bag of sand on us\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be possible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossible or not, there was only one way to prove it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy killing the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94by killing the horse. If you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t grabbed my arm, I should have\r\ncaptured one of Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s accomplices. Now, do you understand the folly\r\nof your act?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThroughout the afternoon both men were morose. They did not speak a\r\nword to each other. At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock they visited the rue Clapeyron, but\r\nwere careful to keep at a safe distance from the houses. However, three\r\nyoung men who were passing through the street, arm in arm, singing, ran\r\nagainst Sholmes and Wilson and refused to let them pass. Sholmes, who\r\nwas in an ill humor, contested the right of way with them. After a\r\nbrief struggle, Sholmes resorted to his fists. He struck one of the men\r\na hard blow on the chest, another a blow in the face, and thus subdued\r\ntwo of his adversaries. Thereupon the three of them took to their heels\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cthat does me good. I needed a little\r\nexercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Wilson was leaning against the wall. Sholmes said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, old chap? You\xe2\x80\x99re quite pale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson pointed to his left arm, which hung inert, and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is. My arm pains me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much?... Is it serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am afraid so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to raise his arm, but it was helpless. Sholmes felt it, gently\r\nat first, then in a rougher way, \xe2\x80\x9cto see how badly it was hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. He concluded that Wilson was really hurt, so he led him to a\r\nneighboring pharmacy, where a closer examination revealed the fact that\r\nthe arm was broken and that Wilson was a candidate for the hospital. In\r\nthe meantime they bared his arm and applied some remedies to ease his\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, old chap, cheer up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, who was holding\r\nWilson\xe2\x80\x99s arm, \xe2\x80\x9cin five or six weeks you will be all right again. But I\r\nwill pay them back ... the rascals! Especially Lupin, for this is his\r\nwork ... no doubt of that. I swear to you if ever\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly, dropped the arm\xe2\x80\x94which caused Wilson such an access\r\nof pain that he almost fainted\xe2\x80\x94and, striking his forehead, Sholmes\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, I have an idea. You know, I have one occasionally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment, silent, with staring eyes, and then muttered, in\r\nshort, sharp phrases:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it ... that will explain all ... right at my feet ... and\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it ... ah, parbleu! I should have thought of it before....\r\nWilson, I shall have good news for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbruptly leaving his old friend, Sholmes ran into the street and went\r\ndirectly to the house known as number 25. On one of the stones, to the\r\nright of the door, he read this inscription: \xe2\x80\x9cDestange, architect,\r\n1875.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a similar inscription on the house numbered 23.\r\n\r\nOf course, there was nothing unusual in that. But what might be read on\r\nthe houses in the avenue Henri-Martin?\r\n\r\nA carriage was passing. He engaged it and directed the driver to take\r\nhim to No. 134 avenue Henri-Martin. He was roused to a high pitch of\r\nexcitement. He stood up in the carriage and urged the horse to greater\r\nspeed. He offered extra pourboires to the driver. Quicker! Quicker!\r\n\r\nHow great was his anxiety as they turned from the rue de la Pompe! Had\r\nhe caught a glimpse of the truth at last?\r\n\r\nOn one of the stones of the late Baron\xe2\x80\x99s house he read the words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDestange, architect, 1874.\xe2\x80\x9d And a similar inscription appeared on the\r\ntwo adjoining houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reaction was such that he settled down in the seat of the carriage,\r\ntrembling from joy. At last, a tiny ray of light had penetrated the\r\ndark shadows which encompassed these mysterious crimes! In the vast\r\nsombre forest wherein a thousand pathways crossed and re-crossed, he\r\nhad discovered the first clue to the track followed by the enemy!\r\n\r\nHe entered a branch postoffice and obtained telephonic connection with\r\nthe ch\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon. The Countess answered the telephone call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!... Is that you, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Sholmes, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Everything going all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite well, but I wish to ask you one question.... Hello!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, when was the ch\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon built?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was destroyed by fire and rebuilt about thirty years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho built it, and in what year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an inscription on the front of the house which reads: \xe2\x80\x98Lucien\r\nDestange, architect, 1877.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, madame, that is all. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went away, murmuring: \xe2\x80\x9cDestange ... Lucien Destange ... that name\r\nhas a familiar sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe noticed a public reading-room, entered, consulted a dictionary of\r\nmodern biography, and copied the following information: \xe2\x80\x9cLucien\r\nDestange, born 1840, Grand-Prix de Rome, officer of the Legion of\r\nHonor, author of several valuable books on architecture, etc....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he returned to the pharmacy and found that Wilson had been taken\r\nto the hospital. There Sholmes found him with his arm in splints, and\r\nshivering with fever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictory! Victory!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cI hold one end of the thread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what thread?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one that leads to victory. I shall now be walking on solid ground,\r\nwhere there will be footprints, clues....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCigarette ashes?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wilson, whose curiosity had overcome his pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd many other things! Just think, Wilson, I have found the mysterious\r\nlink which unites the different adventures in which the blonde Lady\r\nplayed a part. Why did Lupin select those three houses for the scenes\r\nof his exploits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause those three houses were built by the same architect. That was\r\nan easy problem, eh? Of course ... but who would have thought of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one but you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who, except I, knows that the same architect, by the use of\r\nanalogous plans, has rendered it possible for a person to execute three\r\ndistinct acts which, though miraculous in appearance, are, in reality,\r\nquite simple and easy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a stroke of good luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it was time, dear boy, as I was becoming very impatient. You know,\r\nthis is our fourth day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! after this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes was excited, delighted, and gayer than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I think that these rascals might have attacked me in the\r\nstreet and broken my arm just as they did yours! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so,\r\nWilson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson simply shivered at the horrible thought. Sholmes continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must profit by the lesson. I can see, Wilson, that we were wrong to\r\ntry and fight Lupin in the open, and leave ourselves exposed to his\r\nattacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see it, and feel it, too, in my broken arm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have one consolation, Wilson; that is, that I escaped. Now, I must\r\nbe doubly cautious. In an open fight he will defeat me; but if I can\r\nwork in the dark, unseen by him, I have the advantage, no matter how\r\nstrong his forces may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGanimard might be of some assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! On the day that I can truly say: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is there; I show\r\nyou the quarry, and how to catch it; I shall go and see Ganimard at one\r\nof the two addresses that he gave me\xe2\x80\x94his residence in the rue\r\nPergolese, or at the Suisse tavern in the Place du Ch\xc3\xa2telet. But, until\r\nthat time, I shall work alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe approached the bed, placed his hand on Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder\xe2\x80\x94on the sore\r\none, of course\xe2\x80\x94and said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care of yourself, old fellow. Henceforth your r\xc3\xb4le will be to\r\nkeep two or three of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s men busy watching here in vain for\r\nmy return to enquire about your health. It is a secret mission for you,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I shall do my best to fulfil it conscientiously. Then you do\r\nnot expect to come here any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know ... of course.... I am getting on as well as possible.\r\nBut, Herlock, do me a last service: give me a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am dying of thirst; and with my fever\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure\xe2\x80\x94directly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a pretense of getting some water, perceived a package of\r\ntobacco, lighted his pipe, and then, as if he had not heard his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s request, he went away, whilst Wilson uttered a mute prayer for\r\nthe inaccessible water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Destange!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant eyed from head to foot the person to whom he had opened the\r\ndoor of the house\xe2\x80\x94the magnificent house that stood at the corner of the\r\nPlace Malesherbes and the rue Montchanin\xe2\x80\x94and at the sight of the man\r\nwith gray hairs, badly shaved, dressed in a shabby black coat, with a\r\nbody as ill-formed and ungracious as his face, he replied with the\r\ndisdain which he thought the occasion warranted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Destange may or may not be at home. That depends. Has\r\nmonsieur a card?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur did not have a card, but he had a letter of introduction and,\r\nafter the servant had taken the letter to Mon. Destange, he was\r\nconducted into the presence of that gentleman who was sitting in a\r\nlarge circular room or rotunda which occupied one of the wings of the\r\nhouse. It was a library, and contained a profusion of books and\r\narchitectural drawings. When the stranger entered, the architect said\r\nto him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Monsieur Stickmann?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy secretary tells me that he is ill, and has sent you to continue the\r\ngeneral catalogue of the books which he commenced under my direction,\r\nand, more particularly, the catalogue of German books. Are you familiar\r\nwith that kind of work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, quite so,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with a strong German accent.\r\n\r\nUnder those circumstances the bargain was soon concluded, and Mon.\r\nDestange commenced work with his new secretary.\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes had gained access to the house.\r\n\r\nIn order to escape the vigilance of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and gain admittance to\r\nthe house occupied by Lucien Destange and his daughter Clotilde, the\r\nfamous detective had been compelled to resort to a number of\r\nstratagems, and, under a variety of names, to ingratiate himself into\r\nthe good graces and confidence of a number of persons\xe2\x80\x94in short, to\r\nlive, during forty-eight hours, a most complicated life. During that\r\ntime he had acquired the following information: Mon. Destange, having\r\nretired from active business on account of his failing health, now\r\nlived amongst the many books he had accumulated on the subject of\r\narchitecture. He derived infinite pleasure in viewing and handling\r\nthose dusty old volumes.\r\n\r\nHis daughter Clotilde was considered eccentric. She passed her time in\r\nanother part of the house, and never went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d Sholmes said to himself, as he wrote in a register the\r\ntitles of the books which Mon. Destange dictated to him, \xe2\x80\x9call that is\r\nvague and incomplete, but it is quite a long step in advance. I shall\r\nsurely solve one of these absorbing problems: Is Mon. Destange\r\nassociated with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin? Does he continue to see him? Are the\r\npapers relating to the construction of the three houses still in\r\nexistence? Will those papers not furnish me with the location of other\r\nhouses of similar construction which Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and his associates\r\nwill plunder in the future?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Destange, an accomplice of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! That venerable man,\r\nan officer of the Legion of Honor, working in league with a\r\nburglar\xe2\x80\x94such an idea was absurd! Besides, if we concede that such a\r\ncomplicity exists, how could Mon. Destange, thirty years ago, have\r\npossibly foreseen the thefts of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, who was then an infant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo matter! The Englishman was implacable. With his marvellous scent,\r\nand that instinct which never fails him, he felt that he was in the\r\nheart of some strange mystery. Ever since he first entered the house,\r\nhe had been under the influence of that impression, and yet he could\r\nnot define the grounds on which he based his suspicions.\r\n\r\nUp to the morning of the second day he had not made any significant\r\ndiscovery. At two o\xe2\x80\x99clock of that day he saw Clotilde Destange for the\r\nfirst time; she came to the library in search of a book. She was about\r\nthirty years of age, a brunette, slow and silent in her movements, with\r\nfeatures imbued with that expression of indifference which is\r\ncharacteristic of people who live a secluded life. She exchanged a few\r\nwords with her father, and then retired, without even looking at\r\nSholmes.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon dragged along monotonously. At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock Mon. Destange\r\nannounced his intention to go out. Sholmes was alone on the circular\r\ngallery that was constructed about ten feet above the floor of the\r\nrotunda. It was almost dark. He was on the point of going out, when he\r\nheard a slight sound and, at the same time, experienced the feeling\r\nthat there was someone in the room. Several minutes passed before he\r\nsaw or heard anything more. Then he shuddered; a shadowy form emerged\r\nfrom the gloom, quite close to him, upon the balcony. It seemed\r\nincredible. How long had this mysterious visitor been there? Whence did\r\nhe come?\r\n\r\nThe strange man descended the steps and went directly to a large oaken\r\ncupboard. Sholmes was a keen observer of the man\xe2\x80\x99s movements. He\r\nwatched him searching amongst the papers with which the cupboard was\r\nfilled. What was he looking for?\r\n\r\nThen the door opened and Mlle. Destange entered, speaking to someone\r\nwho was following her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have decided not to go out, father?... Then I will make a light\r\n... one second ... do not move....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strange man closed the cupboard and hid in the embrasure of a large\r\nwindow, drawing the curtains together. Did Mlle. Destange not see him?\r\nDid she not hear him? Calmly she turned on the electric lights; she and\r\nher father sat down close to each other. She opened a book she had\r\nbrought with her, and commenced to read. After the lapse of a few\r\nminutes she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour secretary has gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like him as well as you did at first?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, as if she\r\nwere not aware of the illness of the real secretary and his replacement\r\nby Stickmann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Destange\xe2\x80\x99s head bobbed from one side to the other. He was\r\nasleep. The girl resumed her reading. A moment later one of the window\r\ncurtains was pushed back, and the strange man emerged and glided along\r\nthe wall toward the door, which obliged him to pass behind Mon.\r\nDestange but in front of Clotilde, and brought him into the light so\r\nthat Herlock Sholmes obtained a good view of the man\xe2\x80\x99s face. It was\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman was delighted. His forecast was verified; he had\r\npenetrated to the very heart of the mystery, and found Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin to\r\nbe the moving spirit in it.\r\n\r\nClotilde had not yet displayed any knowledge of his presence, although\r\nit was quite improbable that any movement of the intruder had escaped\r\nher notice. Lupin had almost reached the door and, in fact, his hand\r\nwas already seeking the door-knob, when his coat brushed against a\r\nsmall table and knocked something to the floor. Monsieur Destange awoke\r\nwith a start. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was already standing in front of him, hat in\r\nhand, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaxime Bermond,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mon. Destange, joyfully. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Maxime,\r\nwhat lucky chance brings you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wish to see you and Mademoiselle Destange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you return from your journey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must stay to dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, I am sorry, but I have an appointment to dine with some\r\nfriends at a restaurant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, to-morrow, then, Clotilde, you must urge him to come to-morrow.\r\nAh! my dear Maxime.... I thought of you many times during your\r\nabsence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I went through all my old papers in that cupboard, and found our\r\nlast statement of account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat account?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRelating to the avenue Henri-Martin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! do you keep such papers? What for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the three of them left the room, and continued their conversation\r\nin a small parlor which adjoined the library.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d Sholmes asked himself, in a sudden access of doubt.\r\nCertainly, from all appearances, it was he; and yet it was also someone\r\nelse who resembled Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin in certain respects, and who still\r\nmaintained his own individuality, features, and color of hair. Sholmes\r\ncould hear Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s voice in the adjoining room. He was relating some\r\nstories at which Mon. Destange laughed heartily, and which even brought\r\na smile to the lips of the melancholy Clotilde. And each of those\r\nsmiles appeared to be the reward which Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was seeking, and\r\nwhich he was delighted to have secured. His success caused him to\r\nredouble his efforts and, insensibly, at the sound of that clear and\r\nhappy voice, Clotilde\xe2\x80\x99s face brightened and lost that cold and listless\r\nexpression which usually pervaded it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey love each other,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what the deuce can there\r\nbe in common between Clotilde Destange and Maxime Bermond? Does she\r\nknow that Maxime is none other than Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUntil seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Sholmes was an anxious listener, seeking to profit\r\nby the conversation. Then, with infinite precaution, he descended from\r\nthe gallery, crept along the side of the room to the door in such a\r\nmanner that the people in the adjoining room did not see him.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the street Sholmes satisfied himself that there was\r\nneither an automobile nor a cab waiting there; then he slowly limped\r\nalong the boulevard Malesherbes. He turned into an adjacent street,\r\ndonned the overcoat which he had carried on his arm, altered the shape\r\nof his hat, assumed an upright carriage, and, thus transformed,\r\nreturned to a place whence he could watch the door of Mon. Destange\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin came out, and proceeded to walk toward\r\nthe center of Paris by way of the rues de Constantinople and London.\r\nHerlock Sholmes followed at a distance of a hundred paces.\r\n\r\nExciting moments for the Englishman! He sniffed the air, eagerly, like\r\na hound following a fresh scent. It seemed to him a delightful thing\r\nthus to follow his adversary. It was no longer Herlock Sholmes who was\r\nbeing watched, but Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, the invisible Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. He held\r\nhim, so to speak, within the grasp of his eye, by an imperceptible bond\r\nthat nothing could break. And he was pleased to think that the quarry\r\nbelonged to him.\r\n\r\nBut he soon observed a suspicious circumstance. In the intervening\r\nspace between him and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin he noticed several people traveling\r\nin the same direction, particularly two husky fellows in slouch hats on\r\nthe left side of the street, and two others on the right wearing caps\r\nand smoking cigarettes. Of course, their presence in that vicinity may\r\nhave been the result of chance, but Sholmes was more astonished when he\r\nobserved that the four men stopped when Lupin entered a tobacco shop;\r\nand still more surprised when the four men started again after Lupin\r\nemerged from the shop, each keeping to his own side of the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse it!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sholmes; \xe2\x80\x9che is being followed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was annoyed at the idea that others were on the trail of Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin; that someone might deprive him, not of the glory\xe2\x80\x94he cared little\r\nfor that\xe2\x80\x94but of the immense pleasure of capturing, single-handed, the\r\nmost formidable enemy he had ever met. And he felt that he was not\r\nmistaken; the men presented to Sholmes\xe2\x80\x99 experienced eye the appearance\r\nand manner of those who, while regulating their gait to that of\r\nanother, wish to present a careless and natural air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this some of Ganimard\xe2\x80\x99s work?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he playing me\r\nfalse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt inclined to speak to one of the men with a view of acting in\r\nconcert with him; but as they were now approaching the boulevard the\r\ncrowd was becoming denser, and he was afraid he might lose sight of\r\nLupin. So he quickened his pace and turned into the boulevard just in\r\ntime to see Lupin ascending the steps of the Hungarian restaurant at\r\nthe corner of the rue du Helder. The door of the restaurant was open,\r\nso that Sholmes, while sitting on a bench on the other side of the\r\nboulevard, could see Lupin take a seat at a table, luxuriously\r\nappointed and decorated with flowers, at which three gentlemen and two\r\nladies of elegant appearance were already seated and who extended to\r\nLupin a hearty greeting.\r\n\r\nSholmes now looked about for the four men and perceived them amongst a\r\ncrowd of people who were listening to a gipsy orchestra that was\r\nplaying in a neighboring caf\xc3\xa9. It was a curious thing that they were\r\npaying no attention to Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, but seemed to be friendly with the\r\npeople around them. One of them took a cigarette from his pocket and\r\napproached a gentleman who wore a frock coat and silk hat. The\r\ngentleman offered the other his cigar for a light, and Sholmes had the\r\nimpression that they talked to each other much longer than the occasion\r\ndemanded. Finally the gentleman approached the Hungarian restaurant,\r\nentered and looked around. When he caught sight of Lupin he advanced\r\nand spoke to him for a moment, then took a seat at an adjoining table.\r\nSholmes now recognized this gentleman as the horseman who had tried to\r\nrun him down in the avenue Henri-Martin.\r\n\r\nThen Sholmes understood that these men were not tracking Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin;\r\nthey were a part of his band. They were watching over his safety. They\r\nwere his bodyguard, his satellites, his vigilant escort. Wherever\r\ndanger threatened Lupin, these confederates were at hand to avert it,\r\nready to defend him. The four men were accomplices. The gentleman in\r\nthe frock coat was an accomplice. These facts furnished the Englishman\r\nwith food for reflection. Would he ever succeed in capturing that\r\ninaccessible individual? What unlimited power was possessed by such an\r\norganization, directed by such a chief!\r\n\r\nHe tore a leaf from his notebook, wrote a few lines in pencil, which he\r\nplaced in an envelope, and said to a boy about fifteen years of age who\r\nwas sitting on the bench beside him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, my boy; take a carriage and deliver this letter to the cashier\r\nof the Suisse tavern, Place du Ch\xc3\xa2telet. Be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave him a five-franc piece. The boy disappeared.\r\n\r\nA half hour passed away. The crowd had grown larger, and Sholmes\r\nperceived only at intervals the accomplices of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. Then\r\nsomeone brushed against him and whispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? what is it, Monsieur Sholmes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is you, Ganimard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I received your note at the tavern. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ... in the restaurant. Lean to the right.... Do you see him\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is pouring a glass of champagne for the lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you.... Ah! yet, it may be. It looks a great deal like\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard, naively. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the others\xe2\x80\x94accomplices?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the lady sitting beside him is Lady Cliveden; the other is the\r\nDuchess de Cleath. The gentleman sitting opposite Lupin is the Spanish\r\nAmbassador to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard took a step forward. Sholmes retained him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe prudent. You are alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo is he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he has a number of men on the boulevard mounting guard. And inside\r\nthe restaurant that gentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, when I take Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin by the collar and announce his name, I\r\nshall have the entire room on my side and all the waiters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should prefer to have a few policemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Monsieur Sholmes, we have no choice. We must catch him when we\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was right; Sholmes knew it. It was better to take advantage of the\r\nopportunity and make the attempt. Sholmes simply gave this advice to\r\nGanimard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConceal your identity as long as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes glided behind a newspaper kiosk, whence he could still watch\r\nLupin, who was leaning toward Lady Cliveden, talking and smiling.\r\n\r\nGanimard crossed the street, hands in his pockets, as if he were going\r\ndown the boulevard, but when he reached the opposite sidewalk he turned\r\nquickly and bounded up the steps of the restaurant. There was a shrill\r\nwhistle. Ganimard ran against the head waiter, who had suddenly planted\r\nhimself in the doorway and now pushed Ganimard back with a show of\r\nindignation, as if he were an intruder whose presence would bring\r\ndisgrace upon the restaurant. Ganimard was surprised. At the same\r\nmoment the gentleman in the frock coat came out. He took the part of\r\nthe detective and entered into an exciting argument with the waiter;\r\nboth of them hung on to Ganimard, one pushing him in, the other pushing\r\nhim out in such a manner that, despite all his efforts and despite his\r\nfurious protestations, the unfortunate detective soon found himself on\r\nthe sidewalk.\r\n\r\nThe struggling men were surrounded by a crowd. Two policemen, attracted\r\nby the noise, tried to force their way through the crowd, but\r\nencountered a mysterious resistance and could make no headway through\r\nthe opposing backs and pressing shoulders of the mob.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, as if by magic, the crowd parted and the passage to the\r\nrestaurant was clear. The head waiter, recognizing his mistake, was\r\nprofuse in his apologies; the gentleman in the frock coat ceased his\r\nefforts on behalf of the detective, the crowd dispersed, the policemen\r\npassed on, and Ganimard hastened to the table at which the six guests\r\nwere sitting. But now there were only five! He looked around.... The\r\nonly exit was the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person who was sitting here!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried to the five astonished\r\nguests. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Destro?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA waiter approached and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman went upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard rushed up in the hope of finding him. The upper floor of the\r\nrestaurant contained private dining-rooms and had a private stairway\r\nleading to the boulevard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use looking for him now,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is far away by\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was not far away\xe2\x80\x94two hundred yards at most\xe2\x80\x94in the Madeleine-Bastille\r\nomnibus, which was rolling along very peacefully with its three horses\r\nacross the Place de l\xe2\x80\x99Op\xc3\xa9ra toward the Boulevard des Capucines. Two\r\nsturdy fellows were talking together on the platform. On the roof of\r\nthe omnibus near the stairs an old fellow was sleeping; it was Herlock\r\nSholmes.\r\n\r\nWith bobbing head, rocked by the movement of the vehicle, the\r\nEnglishman said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Wilson could see me now, how proud he would be of his\r\ncollaborator!... Bah! It was easy to foresee that the game was lost, as\r\nsoon as the man whistled; nothing could be done but watch the exits and\r\nsee that our man did not escape. Really, Lupin makes life exciting and\r\ninteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the terminal point Herlock Sholmes, by leaning over, saw Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin leaving the omnibus, and as he passed in front of the men who\r\nformed his bodyguard Sholmes heard him say: \xe2\x80\x9cA l\xe2\x80\x99Etoile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA l\xe2\x80\x99Etoile, exactly, a rendezvous. I shall be there,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sholmes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will follow the two men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin took an automobile; but the men walked the entire distance,\r\nfollowed by Sholmes. They stopped at a narrow house, No. 40 rue\r\nChalgrin, and rang the bell. Sholmes took his position in the shadow of\r\na doorway, whence he could watch the house in question. A man opened\r\none of the windows of the ground floor and closed the shutters. But the\r\nshutters did not reach to the top of the window. The impost was clear.\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten minutes a gentleman rang at the same door and a few\r\nminutes later another man came. A short time afterward an automobile\r\nstopped in front of the house, bringing two passengers: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nand a lady concealed beneath a large cloak and a thick veil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blonde Lady, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes to himself, as the automobile\r\ndrove away.\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes now approached the house, climbed to the window-ledge\r\nand, by standing on tiptoe, he was able to see through the window above\r\nthe shutters. What did he see?\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, leaning against the mantel, was speaking with\r\nconsiderable animation. The others were grouped around him, listening\r\nto him attentively. Amongst them Sholmes easily recognized the\r\ngentleman in the frock coat and he thought one of the other men\r\nresembled the head-waiter of the restaurant. As to the blonde Lady, she\r\nwas seated in an armchair with her back to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are holding a consultation,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are worried\r\nover the incident at the restaurant and are holding a council of war.\r\nAh! what a master stroke it would be to capture all of them at one fell\r\nstroke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of them, having moved toward the door, Sholmes leaped to the ground\r\nand concealed himself in the shadow. The gentleman in the frock coat\r\nand the head-waiter left the house. A moment later a light appeared at\r\nthe windows of the first floor, but the shutters were closed\r\nimmediately and the upper part of the house was dark as well as the\r\nlower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLupin and the woman are on the ground floor; the two confederates live\r\non the upper floor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes.\r\n\r\nSholmes remained there the greater part of the night, fearing that if\r\nhe went away Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin might leave during his absence. At four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, seeing two policemen at the end of the street, he approached\r\nthem, explained the situation and left them to watch the house. He went\r\nto Ganimard\xe2\x80\x99s residence in the rue Pergolese and wakened him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have him yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any better hold on him than you had a while ago, I\r\nmight as well go back to bed. But we may as well go to the\r\nstation-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went to the police station in the rue Mesnil and from there to the\r\nresidence of the commissary, Mon. Decointre. Then, accompanied by half\r\na dozen policemen, they went to the rue Chalgrin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything new?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sholmes, addressing the two policemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was just breaking day when, after taking necessary measures to\r\nprevent escape, the commissary rang the bell and commenced to question\r\nthe concierge. The woman was greatly frightened at this early morning\r\ninvasion, and she trembled as she replied that there were no tenants on\r\nthe ground floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! not a tenant?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but on the first floor there are two men named Leroux. They have\r\nfurnished the apartment on the ground floor for some country\r\nrelations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman and lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho came here last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps ... but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know ... I was asleep. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\r\nfor the key is here. They did not ask for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that key the commissary opened the door of the ground-floor\r\napartment. It comprised only two rooms and they were empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw both of them in this room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt your word,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary; \xe2\x80\x9cbut they are not here\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to the first floor. They must be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first floor is occupied by two men named Leroux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will examine the Messieurs Leroux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all ascended the stairs and the commissary rang. At the second\r\nring a man opened the door; he was in his shirt-sleeves. Sholmes\r\nrecognized him as one of Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s bodyguard. The man assumed a furious\r\nair:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by making such a row at this hour of the morning ...\r\nwaking people up....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he stopped suddenly, astounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive me!... really, gentlemen, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice who it was. Why,\r\nit is Monsieur Decointre!... and you, Monsieur Ganimard. What can I do\r\nfor you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, which caused him\r\nto bend double and turn black in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is you, Leroux,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! this is too funny! Leroux,\r\nan accomplice of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! Oh, I shall die! and your brother,\r\nLeroux, where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdmond!\xe2\x80\x9d called the man. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Ganimard, who has come to visit us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother man appeared and at sight of him Ganimard\xe2\x80\x99s mirth redoubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! we had no idea of this! Ah! my friends, you are in a bad fix\r\nnow. Who would have ever suspected it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning to Sholmes, Ganimard introduced the man:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictor Leroux, a detective from our office, one of the best men in the\r\niron brigade ... Edmond Leroux, chief clerk in the anthropometric\r\nservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nAN ABDUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes said nothing. To protest? To accuse the two men? That\r\nwould be useless. In the absence of evidence which he did not possess\r\nand had no time to seek, no one would believe him. Moreover, he was\r\nstifled with rage, but would not display his feelings before the\r\ntriumphant Ganimard. So he bowed respectfully to the brothers Leroux,\r\nguardians of society, and retired.\r\n\r\nIn the vestibule he turned toward a low door which looked like the\r\nentrance to a cellar, and picked up a small red stone; it was a garnet.\r\nWhen he reached the street he turned and read on the front of the house\r\nthis inscription: \xe2\x80\x9cLucien Destange, architect, 1877.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe adjoining house, No. 42, bore the same inscription.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways the double passage\xe2\x80\x94numbers 40 and 42 have a secret means of\r\ncommunication. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I think of that? I should have remained with\r\nthe two policemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe met the policemen near the corner and said to them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo people came out of house No. 42 during my absence, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a gentleman and lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard approached. Sholmes took his arm, and as they walked down the\r\nstreet he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Ganimard, you have had a good laugh and will no doubt forgive\r\nme for the trouble I have caused you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm done; but it was a good joke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admit that; but the best jokes have only a short life, and this one\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t last much longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is now the seventh day, and I can remain only three days more.\r\nThen I must return to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to ask you to be in readiness, as I may call on you at any hour\r\non Tuesday or Wednesday night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor an expedition of the same kind as we had to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, the very same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith what result?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe capture of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear it, on my honor, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes bade Ganimard good-bye and went to the nearest hotel for a few\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x99 sleep; after which, refreshed and with renewed confidence in\r\nhimself, he returned to the rue Chalgrin, slipped two louis into the\r\nhand of the concierge, assured himself that the brothers Leroux had\r\ngone out, learned that the house belonged to a Monsieur Harmingeat,\r\nand, provided with a candle, descended to the cellar through the low\r\ndoor near which he had found the garnet. At the bottom of the stairs he\r\nfound another exactly like it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the means of communication.\r\nLet me see if my skeleton-key will open the cellar reserved for the\r\ntenant of the ground floor. Yes; it will. Now, I will examine those\r\ncases of wine... oh! oh! here are some places where the dust has been\r\ncleared away ... and some footprints on the ground....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight noise caused him to listen attentively. Quickly he pushed the\r\ndoor shut, blew out his candle and hid behind a pile of empty wine\r\ncases. After a few seconds he noticed that a portion of the wall swung\r\non a pivot, the light of a lantern was thrown into the cellar, an arm\r\nappeared, then a man entered.\r\n\r\nHe was bent over, as if he were searching for something. He felt in the\r\ndust with his fingers and several times he threw something into a\r\ncardboard box that he carried in his left hand. Afterward he\r\nobliterated the traces of his footsteps, as well as the footprints left\r\nby Lupin and the blonde lady, and he was about to leave the cellar by\r\nthe same way as he had entered, when he uttered a harsh cry and fell to\r\nthe ground. Sholmes had leaped upon him. It was the work of a moment,\r\nand in the simplest manner in the world the man found himself stretched\r\non the ground, bound and handcuffed. The Englishman leaned over him and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything to say?... To tell what you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man replied by such an ironical smile that Sholmes realized the\r\nfutility of questioning him. So he contented himself by exploring the\r\npockets of his captive, but he found only a bunch of keys, a\r\nhandkerchief and the small cardboard box which contained a dozen\r\ngarnets similar to those which Sholmes had found.\r\n\r\nThen what was he to do with the man? Wait until his friends came to his\r\nhelp and deliver all of them to the police? What good would that do?\r\nWhat advantage would that give him over Lupin?\r\n\r\nHe hesitated; but an examination of the box decided the question. The\r\nbox bore this name and address: \xe2\x80\x9cLeonard, jeweler, rue de la Paix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe resolved to abandon the man to his fate. He locked the cellar and\r\nleft the house. At a branch postoffice he sent a telegram to Monsieur\r\nDestange, saying that he could not come that day. Then he went to see\r\nthe jeweler and, handing him the garnets, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame sent me with these stones. She wishes to have them reset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes had struck the right key. The jeweler replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; the lady telephoned to me. She said she would be here\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes established himself on the sidewalk to wait for the lady, but\r\nit was five o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he saw a heavily-veiled lady approach and\r\nenter the store. Through the window he saw her place on the counter a\r\npiece of antique jewelry set with garnets.\r\n\r\nShe went away almost immediately, walking quickly and passed through\r\nstreets that were unknown to the Englishman. As it was now almost dark,\r\nhe walked close behind her and followed her into a five-story house of\r\ndouble flats and, therefore, occupied by numerous tenants. At the\r\nsecond floor she stopped and entered. Two minutes later the Englishman\r\ncommenced to try the keys on the bunch he had taken from the man in the\r\nrue Chalgrin. The fourth key fitted the lock.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the darkness of the rooms, he perceived that they were\r\nabsolutely empty, as if unoccupied, and the various doors were standing\r\nopen so that he could see all the apartments. At the end of a corridor\r\nhe perceived a ray of light and, by approaching on tiptoe and looking\r\nthrough the glass door, he saw the veiled lady who had removed her hat\r\nand dress and was now wearing a velvet dressing-gown. The discarded\r\ngarments were lying on the only chair in the room and a lighted lamp\r\nstood on the mantel.\r\n\r\nThen he saw her approach the fireplace and press what appeared to be\r\nthe button of an electric bell. Immediately the panel to the right of\r\nthe fireplace moved and slowly glided behind the adjoining panel, thus\r\ndisclosing an opening large enough for a person to pass through. The\r\nlady disappeared through this opening, taking the lamp with her.\r\n\r\nThe operation was a very simple one. Sholmes adopted it and followed\r\nthe lady. He found himself in total darkness and immediately he felt\r\nhis face brushed by some soft articles. He lighted a match and found\r\nthat he was in a very small room completely filled with cloaks and\r\ndresses suspended on hangers. He picked his way through until he\r\nreached a door that was draped with a portiere. He peeped through and,\r\nbehold, the blonde lady was there, under his eyes, and almost within\r\nreach of his hand.\r\n\r\nShe extinguished the lamp and turned on the electric lights. Then for\r\nthe first time Herlock Sholmes obtained a good look at her face. He was\r\namazed. The woman, whom he had overtaken after so much trouble and\r\nafter so many tricks and man\xc5\x93uvres, was none other than Clotilde\r\nDestange.\r\n\r\n\r\nClotilde Destange, the assassin of the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec and the thief\r\nwho stole the blue diamond! Clotilde Destange, the mysterious friend of\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! And the blonde lady!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am only a stupid ass,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Herlock Sholmes at that moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s friend was a blonde and Clotilde is a brunette, I\r\nnever dreamed that they were the same person. But how could the blonde\r\nlady remain a blonde after the murder of the baron and the theft of the\r\ndiamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes could see a portion of the room; it was a boudoir, furnished\r\nwith the most delightful luxury and exquisite taste, and adorned with\r\nbeautiful tapestries and costly ornaments. A mahogany couch,\r\nupholstered in silk, was located on the side of the room opposite the\r\ndoor at which Sholmes was standing. Clotilde was sitting on this couch,\r\nmotionless, her face covered by her hands. Then he perceived that she\r\nwas weeping. Great tears rolled down her pale cheeks and fell, drop by\r\ndrop, on the velvet corsage. The tears came thick and fast, as if their\r\nsource were inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nA door silently opened behind her and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin entered. He looked\r\nat her for a long time without making his presence known; then he\r\napproached her, knelt at her feet, pressed her head to his breast,\r\nfolded her in his arms, and his actions indicated an infinite measure\r\nof love and sympathy. For a time not a word was uttered, but her tears\r\nbecame less abundant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so anxious to make you happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you are crying.... Your tears break my heart, Clotilde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe caressing and sympathetic tone of his voice soothed her, and she\r\nlistened to him with an eager desire for hope and happiness. Her\r\nfeatures were softened by a smile, and yet how sad a smile! He\r\ncontinued to speak in a tone of tender entreaty:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not be unhappy, Clotilde; you have no cause to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe displayed her delicate white hands and said, solemnly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Maxime; so long as I see those hands I shall be sad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are stained with blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! Do not think of that!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dead is past and\r\ngone. Do not resurrect it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he kissed the long, delicate hand, while she regarded him with a\r\nbrighter smile as if each kiss effaced a portion of that dreadful\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must love me, Maxime; you must\xe2\x80\x94because no woman will ever love you\r\nas I do. For your sake, I have done many things, not at your order or\r\nrequest, but in obedience to your secret desires. I have done things at\r\nwhich my will and conscience revolted, but there was some unknown power\r\nthat I could not resist. What I did I did involuntarily, mechanically,\r\nbecause it helped you, because you wished it ... and I am ready to do\r\nit again to-morrow ... and always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Clotilde,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did I draw you into my\r\nadventurous life? I should have remained the Maxime Bermond that you\r\nloved five years ago, and not have let you know the ... other man that\r\nI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love the other man, also, and I have nothing to regret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you regret your past life\xe2\x80\x94the free and happy life you once\r\nenjoyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no regrets when you are here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nfaults and crimes disappear when I see you. When you are away I may\r\nsuffer, and weep, and be horrified at what I have done; but when you\r\ncome it is all forgotten. Your love wipes it all away. And I am happy\r\nagain.... But you must love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not love you on compulsion, Clotilde. I love you simply because\r\n... I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am just as sure of my own love as I am of yours. Only my life is a\r\nvery active and exciting one, and I cannot spend as much time with you\r\nas I would like\xe2\x80\x94just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Some new danger? Tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! nothing serious. Only....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly what?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is on our track.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Herlock Sholmes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it was he who dragged Ganimard into that affair at the Hungarian\r\nrestaurant. It was he who instructed the two policemen to watch the\r\nhouse in the rue Chalgrin. I have proof of it. Ganimard searched the\r\nhouse this morning and Sholmes was with him. Besides\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides? What?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there is another thing. One of our men is missing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanniot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe concierge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I sent him to the rue Chalgrin this morning to pick up the\r\ngarnets that fell out of my brooch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt, then, that Sholmes caught him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the garnets were delivered to the jeweler in the rue de la Paix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, what has become of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Maxime, I am afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to be afraid of, but I confess the situation is very\r\nserious. What does he know? Where does he hide himself? His isolation\r\nis his strong card. I cannot reach him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAct with extreme prudence, Clotilde. Some time ago I decided to change\r\nmy residence to a safer place, and Sholmes\xe2\x80\x99 appearance on the scene has\r\nprompted me to do so at once. When a man like that is on your track,\r\nyou must be prepared for the worst. Well, I am making my preparations.\r\nDay after to-morrow, Wednesday, I shall move. At noon it will be\r\nfinished. At two o\xe2\x80\x99clock I shall leave the place, after removing the\r\nlast trace of our residence there, which will be no small matter. Until\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil then we must not see each other and no one must see you,\r\nClotilde. Do not go out. I have no fear for myself, but I have for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Englishman cannot possibly reach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so sure of that. He is a dangerous man. Yesterday I came here\r\nto search the cupboard that contains all of Monsieur Destange\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\npapers and records. There is danger there. There is danger everywhere.\r\nI feel that he is watching us\xe2\x80\x94that he is drawing his net around us\r\ncloser and closer. It is one of those intuitions which never deceive\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, Maxime, go, and think no more of my tears. I shall be\r\nbrave, and wait patiently until the danger is past. Adieu, Maxime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey held one another for some time in a last fond embrace. And it was\r\nshe that gently pushed him outside. Sholmes could hear the sound of\r\ntheir voices in the distance.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by the necessities of the situation and the urgent need of\r\nbringing his investigation to a speedy termination, Sholmes proceeded\r\nto make an examination of the house in which he now found himself. He\r\npassed through Clotilde\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir into a corridor, at the end of which\r\nthere was a stairway leading to the lower floor; he was about to\r\ndescend this stairway when he heard voices below, which caused him to\r\nchange his route. He followed the corridor, which was a circular one,\r\nand discovered another stairway, which he descended and found himself\r\namidst surroundings that bore a familiar appearance. He passed through\r\na door that stood partly open and entered a large circular room. It was\r\nMonsieur Destange\xe2\x80\x99s library.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I understand everything. The boudoir\r\nof Mademoiselle Clotilde\xe2\x80\x94the blonde Lady\xe2\x80\x94communicates with a room in\r\nthe adjoining house, and that house does not front on the Place\r\nMalesherbes, but upon an adjacent street, the rue Montchanin, if I\r\nremember the name correctly.... And I now understand how Clotilde\r\nDestange can meet her lover and at the same time create the impression\r\nthat she never leaves the house; and I understand also how Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nwas enabled to make his mysterious entrance to the gallery last night.\r\nAh! there must be another connection between the library and the\r\nadjoining room. One more house full of ways that are dark! And no doubt\r\nLucien Destange was the architect, as usual!... I should take advantage\r\nof this opportunity to examine the contents of the cupboard and perhaps\r\nlearn the location of other houses with secret passages constructed by\r\nMonsieur Destange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes ascended to the gallery and concealed himself behind some\r\ndraperies, where he remained until late in the evening. At last a\r\nservant came and turned off the electric lights. An hour later the\r\nEnglishman, by the light of his lantern, made his way to the cupboard.\r\nAs he had surmised, it contained the architect\xe2\x80\x99s old papers, plans,\r\nspecifications and books of account. It also contained a series of\r\nregisters, arranged according to date, and Sholmes, having selected\r\nthose of the most recent dates, searched in the indexes for the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarmingeat.\xe2\x80\x9d He found it in one of the registers with a reference to\r\npage 63. Turning to that page, he read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarmingeat, 40 rue Chalgrin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a detailed account of the work done in and about\r\nthe installation of a furnace in the house. And in the margin of the\r\nbook someone had written these words: \xe2\x80\x9cSee account M.B.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I thought so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes; \xe2\x80\x9cthe account M.B. is the one I want.\r\nI shall learn from it the actual residence of Monsieur Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was morning before he found that important account. It comprised\r\nsixteen pages, one of which was a copy of the page on which was\r\ndescribed the work done for Mon. Harmingeat of the rue Chalgrin.\r\nAnother page described the work performed for Mon. Vatinel as owner of\r\nthe house at No. 25 rue Clapeyron. Another page was reserved for the\r\nBaron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, 134 avenue Henri-Martin; another was devoted to the\r\nCh\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon, and the eleven other pages to various owners of\r\nhouses in Paris.\r\n\r\nSholmes made a list of those eleven names and addresses; after which he\r\nreturned the books to their proper places, opened a window, jumped out\r\nonto the deserted street and closed the shutters behind him.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached his room at the hotel he lighted his pipe with all the\r\nsolemnity with which he was wont to characterize that act, and amidst\r\nclouds of smoke he studied the deductions that might be drawn from the\r\naccount of M.B., or rather, from the account of Maxime Bermond alias\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock he sent the following message to Ganimard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect to pass through the rue Pergolese this forenoon and will\r\ninform you of a person whose arrest is of the highest importance. In\r\nany event, be at home to-night and to-morrow until noon and have at\r\nleast thirty men at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he engaged an automobile at the stand on the boulevard, choosing\r\none whose chauffeur looked good-natured but dull-witted, and instructed\r\nhim to drive to the Place Malesherbes, where he stopped him about one\r\nhundred feet from Monsieur Destange\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, close your carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the chauffeur; \xe2\x80\x9cturn up the\r\ncollar of your coat, for the wind is cold, and wait patiently. At the\r\nend of an hour and a half, crank up your machine. When I return we will\r\ngo to the rue Pergolese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he was ascending the steps leading to the door a doubt entered his\r\nmind. Was it not a mistake on his part to be spending his time on the\r\naffairs of the blonde Lady, while Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was preparing to move?\r\nWould he not be better engaged in trying to find the abode of his\r\nadversary amongst the eleven houses on his list?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the blonde Lady becomes my prisoner, I shall\r\nbe master of the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonsieur Destange was already in the library. They had been working\r\nonly a few minutes, when Clotilde entered, bade her father good\r\nmorning, entered the adjoining parlor and sat down to write. From his\r\nplace Sholmes could see her leaning over the table and from time to\r\ntime absorbed in deep meditation. After a short time he picked up a\r\nbook and said to Monsieur Destange:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a book that Mademoiselle Destange asked me to bring to her\r\nwhen I found it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went into the little parlor, stood before Clotilde in such a manner\r\nthat her father could not see her, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Monsieur Stickmann, your father\xe2\x80\x99s new secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clotilde, without moving, \xe2\x80\x9cmy father has changed his\r\nsecretary? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mademoiselle, and I desire to speak with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly take a seat, monsieur; I have finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe added a few words to her letter, signed it, enclosed it in the\r\nenvelope, sealed it, pushed her writing material away, rang the\r\ntelephone, got in communication with her dressmaker, asked the latter\r\nto hasten the completion of a traveling dress, as she required it at\r\nonce, and then, turning to Sholmes, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at your service, monsieur. But do you wish to speak before my\r\nfather? Would not that be better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mademoiselle; and I beg of you, do not raise your voice. It is\r\nbetter that Monsieur Destange should not hear us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor whose sake is it better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours, mademoiselle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot agree to hold any conversation with you that my father may\r\nnot hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must agree to this. It is imperative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth of them arose, eye to eye. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill standing, he commenced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be so good as to pardon me if I am mistaken on certain points\r\nof secondary importance. I will guarantee, however, the general\r\naccuracy of my statements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan we not dispense with these preliminaries, monsieur? Or are they\r\nnecessary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes felt the young woman was on her guard, so he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I will come to the point. Five years ago your father made\r\nthe acquaintance of a certain young man called Maxime Bermond, who was\r\nintroduced as a contractor or an architect, I am not sure which it was;\r\nbut it was one or the other. Monsieur Destange took a liking to the\r\nyoung man, and as the state of his health compelled him to retire from\r\nactive business, he entrusted to Monsieur Bermond the execution of\r\ncertain orders he had received from some of his old customers and which\r\nseemed to come within the scope of Monsieur Bermond\xe2\x80\x99s ability.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes stopped. It seemed to him that the girl\xe2\x80\x99s pallor had\r\nincreased. Yet there was not the slightest tremor in her voice when she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about the circumstances to which you refer, monsieur,\r\nand I do not see in what way they can interest me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this way, mademoiselle: You know, as well as I, that Maxime Bermond\r\nis also known by the name of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin? Maxime Bermond is Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin? Oh! no! It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t possible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor to inform you of that fact, and since you refuse to\r\nunderstand my meaning, I will add that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin has found in this\r\nhouse a friend\xe2\x80\x94more than a friend\xe2\x80\x94and accomplice, blindly and\r\npassionately devoted to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout emotion, or at least with so little emotion that Sholmes was\r\nastonished at her self-control, she declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand your object, monsieur, and I do not care to; but I\r\ncommand you to say no more and leave this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no intention of forcing my presence on you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sholmes,\r\nwith equal sang-froid, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall not leave this house alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who will accompany you, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mademoiselle, we will leave this house together, and you will\r\nfollow me without one word of protest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strange feature of the foregoing interview was the absolute\r\ncoolness of the two adversaries. It bore no resemblance to an\r\nimplacable duel between two powerful wills; but, judging solely from\r\ntheir attitude and the tone of their voices, an onlooker would have\r\nsupposed their conversation to be nothing more serious than a courteous\r\nargument over some impersonal subject.\r\n\r\nClotilde resumed her seat without deigning to reply to the last remark\r\nof Herlock Sholmes, except by a shrug of her shoulders. Sholmes looked\r\nat his watch and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is half-past ten. We will leave here in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf not, I shall go to Monsieur Destange, and tell him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth. I will tell him of the vicious life of Maxime Bermond, and\r\nI will tell him of the double life of his accomplice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf his accomplice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of the woman known as the blonde Lady, of the woman who was\r\nblonde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat proofs will you give him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take him to the rue Chalgrin, and show him the secret passage\r\nmade by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s workmen,\xe2\x80\x94while doing the work of which he had\r\nthe control\xe2\x80\x94between the houses numbered 40 and 42; the passage which\r\nyou and he used two nights ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will then take Monsieur Destange to the house of Monsieur Detinan;\r\nwe will descend the servant\xe2\x80\x99s stairway which was used by you and Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin when you escaped from Ganimard, and we will search together the\r\nmeans of communication with the adjoining house, which fronts on the\r\nBoulevard des Batignolles, and not upon the rue Clapeyron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take Monsieur Destange to the ch\xc3\xa2teau de Crozon, and it will be\r\neasy for him, who knows the nature of the work performed by Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin in the restoration of the Ch\xc3\xa2teau, to discover the secret\r\npassages constructed there by his workmen. It will thus be established\r\nthat those passages allowed the blonde Lady to make a nocturnal visit\r\nto the Countess\xe2\x80\x99 room and take the blue diamond from the mantel; and,\r\ntwo weeks later, by similar means, to enter the room of Herr Bleichen\r\nand conceal the blue diamond in his tooth-powder\xe2\x80\x94a strange action, I\r\nconfess; a woman\xe2\x80\x99s revenge, perhaps; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herlock Sholmes, in a more serious tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\ntake Monsieur Destange to 134 avenue Henri-Martin, and we will learn\r\nhow the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, keep quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the girl, struck with a sudden terror,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forbid you!... you dare to say that it was I ... you accuse me?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accuse you of having killed the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, it is a lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou killed the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, mademoiselle. You entered his service\r\nunder the name of Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat, for the purpose of stealing the\r\nblue diamond and you killed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep quiet, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d she implored him. \xe2\x80\x9cSince you know so much, you\r\nmust know that I did not murder the baron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not say that you murdered him, mademoiselle. Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec was\r\nsubject to fits of insanity that only Sister Auguste could control. She\r\ntold me so herself. In her absence, he must have attacked you, and in\r\nthe course of the struggle you struck him in order to save your own\r\nlife. Frightened at your awful situation, you rang the bell, and fled\r\nwithout even taking the blue diamond from the finger of your victim. A\r\nfew minutes later you returned with one of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s accomplices,\r\nwho was a servant in the adjoining house, you placed the baron on the\r\nbed, you put the room in order, but you were afraid to take the blue\r\ndiamond. Now, I have told you what happened on that night. I repeat,\r\nyou did not murder the baron, and yet it was your hand that struck the\r\nblow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had crossed them over her forehead\xe2\x80\x94those long delicate white\r\nhands\xe2\x80\x94and kept them thus for a long time. At last, loosening her\r\nfingers, she said, in a voice rent by anguish:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you intend to tell all that to my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and I will tell him that I have secured as witnesses:\r\nMademoiselle Gerbois, who will recognize the blonde Lady; Sister\r\nAuguste, who will recognize Antoinette Br\xc3\xa9hat; and the Countess de\r\nCrozon, who will recognize Madame de R\xc3\xa9al. That is what I shall tell\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not dare,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, recovering her self-possession in the\r\nface of an immediate peril.\r\n\r\nHe arose, and made a step toward the library. Clotilde stopped him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, reflected a moment, and then, perfect mistress of herself,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Herlock Sholmes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want? I am fighting a duel with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, and I must\r\nwin. The contest is now drawing to a climax, and I have an idea that a\r\nhostage as precious as you will give me an important advantage over my\r\nadversary. Therefore, you will follow me, mademoiselle; I will entrust\r\nyou to one of my friends. As soon as the duel is ended, you will be set\r\nat liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all. I do not belong to the police service of this country,\r\nand, consequently, I do not consider that I am under any obligation ...\r\nto cause your arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe appeared to have come to a decision ... yet she required a\r\nmomentary respite. She closed her eyes, the better to concentrate her\r\nthoughts. Sholmes looked at her in surprise; she was now so tranquil\r\nand, apparently, indifferent to the dangers which threatened her.\r\nSholmes thought: Does she believe that she is in danger? Probably\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94since Lupin protects her. She has confidence in him. She believes\r\nthat Lupin is omnipotent, and infallible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you that we would leave here in five\r\nminutes. That time has almost expired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you permit me to go to my room, monsieur, to get some necessary\r\narticles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, mademoiselle; and I will wait for you in the rue\r\nMontchanin. Jeanniot, the concierge, is a friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you know....\xe2\x80\x9d she said, visibly alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know many things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I will ring for the maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maid brought her hat and jacket. Then Sholmes said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must give Monsieur Destange some reason for our departure, and, if\r\npossible, let your excuse serve for an absence of several days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shall not be necessary. I shall be back very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey exchanged defiant glances and an ironic smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat faith you have in him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does everything well, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he? He succeeds in everything he\r\nundertakes. And whatever he does receives your approval and\r\ncooperation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a touch of passion in her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you think that he will save you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders, and, approaching her father, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to deprive you of Monsieur Stickmann. We are going to the\r\nNational Library.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will return for luncheon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps ... no, I think not ... but don\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she said to Sholmes, in a firm voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at your service, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warn you that if you attempt to escape, I shall call the police and\r\nhave you arrested. Do not forget that the blonde Lady is on parole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you my word of honor that I shall not attempt to escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you. Now, let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey left the house together, as he had predicted.\r\n\r\nThe automobile was standing where Sholmes had left it. As they\r\napproached it, Sholmes could hear the rumbling of the motor. He opened\r\nthe door, asked Clotilde to enter, and took a seat beside her. The\r\nmachine started at once, gained the exterior boulevards, the avenue\r\nHoche and the avenue de la Grande-Arm\xc3\xa9e. Sholmes was considering his\r\nplans. He thought:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGanimard is at home. I will leave the girl in his care. Shall I tell\r\nhim who she is? No, he would take her to prison at once, and that would\r\nspoil everything. When I am alone, I can consult my list of addresses\r\ntaken from the \xe2\x80\x98account M.B.,\xe2\x80\x99 and run them down. To-night, or\r\nto-morrow morning at the latest, I shall go to Ganimard, as I agreed,\r\nand deliver into his hands Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and all his band.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his hand, gleefully, at the thought that his duel with Lupin\r\nwas drawing to a close, and he could not see any serious obstacle in\r\nthe way of his success. And, yielding to an irrepressible desire to\r\ngive vent to his feelings\xe2\x80\x94an unusual desire on his part\xe2\x80\x94he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, mademoiselle, if I am unable to conceal my satisfaction and\r\ndelight. The battle has been a difficult one, and my success is,\r\ntherefore, more enjoyable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA legitimate success, monsieur, of which you have a just right to be\r\nproud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. But where are we going? The chauffeur must have\r\nmisunderstood my directions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment they were leaving Paris by the gate de Neuilly. That was\r\nstrange, as the rue Pergolese is not outside the fortifications.\r\nSholmes lowered the glass, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChauffeur, you have made a mistake.... Rue Pergolese!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man made no reply. Sholmes repeated, in a louder voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you to go to the rue Pergolese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill the man did not reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but you are deaf, my friend. Or is he doing it on purpose? We are\r\nvery much out of our way.... Rue Pergolese!... Turn back at once!...\r\nRue Pergolese!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur made no sign of having heard the order. The Englishman\r\nfretted with impatience. He looked at Clotilde; a mysterious smile\r\nplayed upon her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you laugh?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an awkward mistake, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nThen an idea occurred to him. He rose and made a careful scrutiny of\r\nthe chauffeur. His shoulders were not so broad; his bearing was not so\r\nstiff and mechanical. A cold perspiration covered his forehead and his\r\nhands clenched with sudden fear, as his mind was seized with the\r\nconviction that the chauffeur was Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Monsieur Sholmes, what do you think of our little ride?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelightful, monsieur, really delightful,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sholmes.\r\n\r\nNever in his life had he experienced so much difficulty in uttering a\r\nfew simple words without a tremor, or without betraying his feelings in\r\nhis voice. But quickly, by a sort of reaction, a flood of hatred and\r\nrage burst its bounds, overcame his self-control, and, brusquely\r\ndrawing his revolver, he pointed it at Mademoiselle Destange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLupin, stop, this minute, this second, or I fire at mademoiselle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise you to aim at the cheek if you wish to hit the temple,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Lupin, without turning his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaxime, don\xe2\x80\x99t go so fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clotilde, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pavement is slippery\r\nand I am very timid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was smiling; her eyes were fixed on the pavement, over which the\r\ncarriage was traveling at enormous speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him stop! Let him stop!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes to her, wild with rage, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwarn you that I am desperate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barrel of the revolver brushed the waving locks of her hair. She\r\nreplied, calmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaxime is so imprudent. He is going so fast, I am really afraid of\r\nsome accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes returned the weapon to his pocket and seized the handle of the\r\ndoor, as if to alight, despite the absurdity of such an act. Clotilde\r\nsaid to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, monsieur, there is an automobile behind us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned over. There was an automobile close behind; a large machine\r\nof formidable aspect with its sharp prow and blood-red body, and\r\nholding four men clad in fur coats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I am well guarded,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cI may as well be patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe folded his arms across his chest with that proud air of submission\r\nso frequently assumed by heroes when fate has turned against them. And\r\nwhile they crossed the river Seine and rushed through Suresnes, Rueil\r\nand Chatou, motionless and resigned, controlling his actions and his\r\npassions, he tried to explain to his own satisfaction by what miracle\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had substituted himself for the chauffeur. It was quite\r\nimprobable that the honest-looking fellow he had selected on the\r\nboulevard that morning was an accomplice placed there in advance. And\r\nyet Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had received a warning in some way, and it must have\r\nbeen after he, Sholmes, had approached Clotilde in the house, because\r\nno one could have suspected his project prior to that time. Since then,\r\nSholmes had not allowed Clotilde out of his sight.\r\n\r\nThen an idea struck him: the telephone communication desired by\r\nClotilde and her conversation with the dressmaker. Now, it was all\r\nquite clear to him. Even before he had spoken to her, simply upon his\r\nrequest to speak to her as the new secretary of Monsieur Destange, she\r\nhad scented the danger, surmised the name and purpose of the visitor,\r\nand, calmly, naturally, as if she were performing a commonplace action\r\nof her every-day life, she had called Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin to her assistance by\r\nsome preconcerted signal.\r\n\r\nHow Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had come and caused himself to be substituted for the\r\nchauffeur were matters of trifling importance. That which affected\r\nSholmes, even to the point of appeasing his fury, was the recollection\r\nof that incident whereby an ordinary woman, a sweetheart it is true,\r\nmastering her nerves, controlling her features, and subjugating the\r\nexpression of her eyes, had completely deceived the astute detective\r\nHerlock Sholmes. How difficult to overcome an adversary who is aided by\r\nsuch confederates, and who, by the mere force of his authority,\r\ninspires in a woman so much courage and strength!\r\n\r\nThey crossed the Seine and climbed the hill at Saint-Germain; but, some\r\nfive hundred metres beyond that town, the automobile slackened its\r\nspeed. The other automobile advanced, and the two stopped, side by\r\nside. There was no one else in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Sholmes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, \xe2\x80\x9ckindly exchange to the other machine.\r\nOurs is really a very slow one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, calmly, convinced that he had no choice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso, permit me to loan you a fur coat, as we will travel quite fast\r\nand the air is cool. And accept a couple of sandwiches, as we cannot\r\ntell when we will dine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four men alighted from the other automobile. One of them\r\napproached, and, as he raised his goggles, Sholmes recognized in him\r\nthe gentleman in the frock coat that he had seen at the Hungarian\r\nrestaurant. Lupin said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will return this machine to the chauffeur from whom I hired it. He\r\nis waiting in the first wine-shop to the right as you go up the rue\r\nLegendre. You will give him the balance of the thousand francs I\r\npromised him.... Ah! yes, kindly give your goggles to Monsieur\r\nSholmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe talked to Mlle. Destange for a moment, then took his place at the\r\nwheel and started, with Sholmes at his side and one of his men behind\r\nhim. Lupin had not exaggerated when he said \xe2\x80\x9cwe will travel quite\r\nfast.\xe2\x80\x9d From the beginning he set a breakneck pace. The horizon rushed\r\nto meet them, as if attracted by some mysterious force, and disappeared\r\ninstantly as though swallowed up in an abyss, into which many other\r\nthings, such as trees, houses, fields and forests, were hurled with the\r\ntumultuous fury and haste of a torrent as it approached the cataract.\r\n\r\nSholmes and Lupin did not exchange a word. Above their heads the leaves\r\nof the poplars made a great noise like the waves of the sea,\r\nrhythmically arranged by the regular spacing of the trees. And the\r\ntowns swept by like spectres: Manteo, Vernon, Gaillon. From one hill to\r\nthe other, from Bon-Secours to Canteleu, Rouen, its suburbs, its\r\nharbor, its miles of wharves, Rouen seemed like the straggling street\r\nof a country village. And this was Duclair, Caudebec, the country of\r\nCaux which they skimmed over in their terrific flight, and Lillebonne,\r\nand Quillebeuf. Then, suddenly, they found themselves on the banks of\r\nthe Seine, at the extremity of a little wharf, beside which lay a\r\nstaunch sea-going yacht that emitted great volumes of black smoke from\r\nits funnel.\r\n\r\nThe automobile stopped. In two hours they had traveled over forty\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\nA man, wearing a blue uniform and a goldlaced cap, came forward and\r\nsaluted. Lupin said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ready, captain? Did you receive my telegram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs _The Swallow_ ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Monsieur Sholmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman looked around, saw a group of people on the terrace in\r\nfront of a caf\xc3\xa9, hesitated a moment, then, realizing that before he\r\ncould secure any assistance he would be seized, carried aboard and\r\nplaced in the bottom of the hold, he crossed the gang-plank and\r\nfollowed Lupin into the captain\xe2\x80\x99s cabin. It was quite a large room,\r\nscrupulously clean, and presented a cheerful appearance with its\r\nvarnished woodwork and polished brass. Lupin closed the door and\r\naddressed Sholmes abruptly, and almost rudely, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything? Come, be precise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice contained no longer that polite, if ironical, tone, which he\r\nhad affected when speaking to the Englishman. Now, his voice had the\r\nimperious tone of a master accustomed to command and accustomed to be\r\nobeyed\xe2\x80\x94even by a Herlock Sholmes. They measured each other by their\r\nlooks, enemies now\xe2\x80\x94open and implacable foes. Lupin spoke again, but in\r\na milder tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have grown weary of your pursuit, and do not intend to waste any\r\nmore time in avoiding the traps you lay for me. I warn you that my\r\ntreatment of you will depend on your reply. Now, what do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin controlled his temper and said, in a jerky manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what you know. You know that, under the name of Maxime\r\nBermond, I have ... _improved_ fifteen houses that were originally\r\nconstructed by Monsieur Destange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf those fifteen houses, you have seen four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have a list of the other eleven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou made that list at Monsieur Destange\xe2\x80\x99s house on that night, no\r\ndoubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have an idea that, amongst those eleven houses, there is one\r\nthat I have kept for the use of myself and my friends, and you have\r\nintrusted to Ganimard the task of finding my retreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that signify?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt signifies that I choose to act alone, and do not want his help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I have nothing to fear, since you are in my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have nothing to fear as long as I remain in your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you will not remain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin approached the Englishman and, placing his hand on the\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, monsieur; I am not in a humor to argue with you, and,\r\nunfortunately for you, you are not in a position to choose. So let us\r\nfinish our business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to give me your word of honor that you will not try to\r\nescape from this boat until you arrive in English waters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you my word of honor that I shall escape if I have an\r\nopportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the indomitable Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, sapristi! you know quite well that at a word from me you would\r\nsoon be rendered helpless. All these men will obey me blindly. At a\r\nsign from me they would place you in irons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIrons can be broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd throw you overboard ten miles from shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\r\nmaster ... and let us finish. You will agree that I must take the\r\nmeasures necessary to protect myself and my friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; but they will be useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you do not wish me to take them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin opened the door and called the captain and two sailors. The\r\nlatter seized the Englishman, bound him hand and foot, and tied him to\r\nthe captain\xe2\x80\x99s bunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was only on account of your obstinacy\r\nand the unusual gravity of the situation, that I ventured to offer you\r\nthis indignity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sailors retired. Lupin said to the captain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet one of the crew remain here to look after Monsieur Sholmes, and\r\nyou can give him as much of your own company as possible. Treat him\r\nwith all due respect and consideration. He is not a prisoner, but a\r\nguest. What time have you, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive minutes after two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin consulted his watch, then looked at the clock that was attached\r\nto the wall of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive minutes past two is right. How long will it take you to reach\r\nSouthampton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine hours, easy going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake it eleven. You must not land there until after the departure of\r\nthe midnight boat, which reaches Havre at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\nDo you understand, captain? Let me repeat: As it would be very\r\ndangerous for all of us to permit Monsieur to return to France by that\r\nboat, you must not reach Southampton before one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAu revoir, master; next year, in this world or in the next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sholmes.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Sholmes heard the automobile going away, and at the\r\nsame time the steam puffed violently in the depths of _The Swallow_.\r\nThe boat had started for England. About three o\xe2\x80\x99clock the vessel left\r\nthe mouth of the river and plunged into the open sea. At that moment\r\nSholmes was lying on the captain\xe2\x80\x99s bunk, sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning\xe2\x80\x94it being the tenth and last day of the duel between\r\nSholmes and Lupin\xe2\x80\x94the _Echo de France_ published this interesting bit\r\nof news:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday a judgment of ejectment was entered in the case of Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin against Herlock Sholmes, the English detective. Although signed\r\nat noon, the judgment was executed the same day. At one o\xe2\x80\x99clock this\r\nmorning Sholmes was landed at Southampton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nSECOND ARREST OF ARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock a dozen moving-vans had encumbered the rue Crevaux\r\nbetween the avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne and the avenue Bugeaud. Mon.\r\nFelix Davey was leaving the apartment in which he lived on the fourth\r\nfloor of No. 8; and Mon. Dubreuil, who had united into a single\r\napartment the fifth floor of the same house and the fifth floor of the\r\ntwo adjoining houses, was moving on the same day\xe2\x80\x94a mere coincidence,\r\nsince the gentlemen were unknown to each other\xe2\x80\x94the vast collection of\r\nfurniture regarding which so many foreign agents visited him every day.\r\n\r\nA circumstance which had been noticed by some of the neighbors, but was\r\nnot spoken of until later, was this: None of the twelve vans bore the\r\nname and address of the owner, and none of the men accompanying them\r\nvisited the neighboring wine shops. They worked so diligently that the\r\nfurniture was all out by eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Nothing remained but those\r\nscraps of papers and rags that are always left behind in the corners of\r\nthe empty rooms.\r\n\r\nMon. Felix Davey, an elegant young man, dressed in the latest fashion,\r\ncarried in his hand a walking-stick, the weight of which indicated that\r\nits owner possessed extraordinary biceps\xe2\x80\x94Mon. Felix Davey walked calmly\r\naway and took a seat on a bench in the avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne\r\nfacing the rue Pergolese. Close to him a woman, dressed in a neat but\r\ninexpensive costume, was reading a newspaper, whilst a child was\r\nplaying with a shovel in a heap of sand.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes Felix Davey spoke to the woman, without turning his\r\nhead:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGanimard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWent out at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo police headquarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo telegram during the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they suspect you in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I do some little things for Madame Ganimard, and she tells me\r\neverything her husband does. I have been with her all morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Until further orders come here every day at eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose and walked away in the direction of the Dauphine gate, stopping\r\nat the Chinese pavilion, where he partook of a frugal repast consisting\r\nof two eggs, with some fruit and vegetables. Then he returned to the\r\nrue Crevaux and said to the concierge:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will just glance through the rooms and then give you the keys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe finished his inspection of the room that he had used as a library;\r\nthen he seized the end of a gas-pipe, which hung down the side of the\r\nchimney. The pipe was bent and a hole made in the elbow. To this hole\r\nhe fitted a small instrument in the form of an ear-trumpet and blew\r\ninto it. A slight whistling sound came by way of reply. Placing the\r\ntrumpet to his mouth, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyone around, Dubreuil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned the pipe to its place, saying to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow progressive we are! Our century abounds with little inventions\r\nwhich render life really charming and picturesque. And so amusing!...\r\nespecially when a person knows how to enjoy life as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned one of the marble mouldings of the mantel, and the entire\r\nhalf of the mantel moved, and the mirror above it glided in invisible\r\ngrooves, disclosing an opening and the lower steps of a stairs built in\r\nthe very body of the chimney; all very clean and complete\xe2\x80\x94the stairs\r\nwere constructed of polished metal and the walls of white tiles. He\r\nascended the steps, and at the fifth floor there was the same opening\r\nin the chimney. Mon. Dubreuil was waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you finished in your rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything cleared out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the three men on guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey ascended to the upper floor by the same means, one after the\r\nother, and there found three men, one of whom was looking through the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything new?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, governor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll quiet in the street?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn ten minutes I will be ready to leave. You will go also. But in the\r\nmeantime if you see the least suspicious movement in the street, warn\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my finger on the alarm-bell all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDubreuil, did you tell the moving men not to touch the wire of that\r\nbell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; it is working all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all I want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen then descended to the apartment of Felix Davey and\r\nthe latter, after adjusting the marble mantel, exclaimed, joyfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDubreuil, I should like to see the man who is able to discover all the\r\ningenious devices, warning bells, net-works of electric wires and\r\nacoustic tubes, invisible passages, moving floors and hidden stairways.\r\nA real fairy-land!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fame for Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFame I could well dispense with. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity to be compelled to leave\r\na place so well equipped, and commence all over again, Dubreuil ... and\r\non a new model, of course, for it would never do to duplicate this.\r\nCurse Herlock Sholmes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he returned to Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could he? There has been only one boat come from Southampton and\r\nit left there at midnight; only one train from Havre, leaving there at\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning and due in Paris at eleven fifteen. As he\r\ncould not catch the midnight boat at Southampton\xe2\x80\x94and the instructions\r\nto the captain on that point were explicit\xe2\x80\x94he cannot reach France until\r\nthis evening via Newhaven and Dieppe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he will come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; he never gives up. He will return to Paris; but it will be too\r\nlate. We will be far away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mademoiselle Destange?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to see her in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt her house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no; she will not return there for several days. But you, Dubreuil,\r\nyou must hurry. The loading of our goods will take a long time and you\r\nshould be there to look after them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure that we are not being watched?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom? I am not afraid of anyone but Sholmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDubreuil retired. Felix Davey made a last tour of the apartment, picked\r\nup two or three torn letters, then, noticing a piece of chalk, he took\r\nit and, on the dark paper of the drawing-room, drew a large frame and\r\nwrote within it the following:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, gentleman-burglar, lived here for five years at the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis little pleasantry seemed to please him very much. He looked at it\r\nfor a moment, whistling a lively air, then said to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that I have placed myself in touch with the historians of future\r\ngenerations, I can go. You must hurry, Herlock Sholmes, as I shall\r\nleave my present abode in three minutes, and your defeat will be an\r\naccomplished fact.... Two minutes more! you are keeping me waiting,\r\nMonsieur Sholmes.... One minute more! Are you not coming? Well, then, I\r\nproclaim your downfall and my apotheosis. And now I make my escape.\r\nFarewell, kingdom of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! I shall never see you again.\r\nFarewell to the fifty-five rooms of the six apartments over which I\r\nreigned! Farewell, my own royal bed chamber!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis outburst of joy was interrupted by the sharp ringing of a bell,\r\nwhich stopped twice, started again and then ceased. It was the alarm\r\nbell.\r\n\r\nWhat was wrong? What unforeseen danger? Ganimard? No; that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npossible!\r\n\r\nHe was on the point of returning to his library and making his escape.\r\nBut, first, he went to the window. There was no one in the street. Was\r\nthe enemy already in the house? He listened and thought he could\r\ndiscern certain confused sounds. He hesitated no longer. He ran to his\r\nlibrary, and as he crossed the threshold he heard the noise of a key\r\nbeing inserted in the lock of the vestibule door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no time to lose. The house may be\r\nsurrounded. The servants\xe2\x80\x99 stairway\xe2\x80\x94impossible! Fortunately, there is\r\nthe chimney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pushed the moulding; it did not move. He made a greater effort\xe2\x80\x94still\r\nit refused to move. At the same time he had the impression that the\r\ndoor below opened and that he could hear footsteps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9cI am lost if this cursed mechanism\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pushed with all his strength. Nothing moved\xe2\x80\x94nothing! By some\r\nincredible accident, by some evil stroke of fortune, the mechanism,\r\nwhich had worked only a few moments ago, would not work now.\r\n\r\nHe was furious. The block of marble remained immovable. He uttered\r\nfrightful imprecations on the senseless stone. Was his escape to be\r\nprevented by that stupid obstacle? He struck the marble wildly, madly;\r\nhe hammered it, he cursed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Monsieur Lupin? You seem to be displeased about\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin turned around. Herlock Sholmes stood before him!\r\n\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes!... Lupin gazed at him with squinting eyes as if his\r\nsight were defective and misleading. Herlock Sholmes in Paris! Herlock\r\nSholmes, whom he had shipped to England only the day before as a\r\ndangerous person, now stood before him free and victorious!... Ah! such\r\na thing was nothing less than a miracle; it was contrary to all natural\r\nlaws; it was the culmination of all that is illogical and abnormal....\r\nHerlock Sholmes here\xe2\x80\x94before his face!\r\n\r\nAnd when the Englishman spoke his words were tinged with that keen\r\nsarcasm and mocking politeness with which his adversary had so often\r\nlashed him. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Lupin, in the first place I have the honor to inform you that\r\nat this time and place I blot from my memory forever all thoughts of\r\nthe miserable night that you forced me to endure in the house of Baron\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Hautrec, of the injury done to my friend Wilson, of my abduction in\r\nthe automobile, and of the voyage I took yesterday under your orders,\r\nbound to a very uncomfortable couch. But the joy of this moment effaces\r\nall those bitter memories. I forgive everything. I forget everything\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwipe out the debt. I am paid\xe2\x80\x94and royally paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin made no reply. So the Englishman continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think so yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared to insist as if demanding an acquiescence, as a sort of\r\nreceipt in regard to the part.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, during which the Englishman felt that he\r\nwas scrutinized to the very depth of his soul, Lupin declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume, monsieur, that your conduct is based upon serious motives?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that you have escaped from my captain and his crew is only a\r\nsecondary incident of our struggle. But the fact that you are here\r\nbefore me alone\xe2\x80\x94understand, alone\xe2\x80\x94face to face with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, leads\r\nme to think that your revenge is as complete as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs complete as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurrounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two adjoining houses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurrounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe apartment above this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _three_ apartments on the fifth floor that were formerly occupied\r\nby Monsieur Dubreuil are surrounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that you are captured, Monsieur Lupin\xe2\x80\x94absolutely captured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe feelings that Sholmes had experienced during his trip in the\r\nautomobile were now suffered by Lupin, the same concentrated fury, the\r\nsame revolt, and also, let us admit, the same loyalty of submission to\r\nforce of circumstances. Equally brave in victory or defeat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur accounts are squared, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, frankly.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman was pleased with that confession. After a short silence\r\nLupin, now quite self-possessed, said smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am not sorry! It becomes monotonous to win all the time.\r\nYesterday I had only to stretch out my hand to finish you forever.\r\nToday I belong to you. The game is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d Lupin laughed heartily and\r\nthen continued: \xe2\x80\x9cAt last the gallery will be entertained! Lupin in\r\nprison! How will he get out? In prison!... What an adventure!... Ah!\r\nSholmes, life is just one damn thing after another!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pressed his closed hands to his temples as if to suppress the\r\ntumultuous joy that surged within him, and his actions indicated that\r\nhe was moved by an uncontrollable mirth. At last, when he had recovered\r\nhis self-possession, he approached the detective and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now what are you waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Ganimard is here with his men\xe2\x80\x94why don\xe2\x80\x99t they come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked him not to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he consented?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accepted his services on condition that he would be guided by me.\r\nBesides, he thinks that Felix Davey is only an accomplice of Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will repeat my question in another form. Why did you come in\r\nalone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wished to speak to you alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah! you have something to say to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat idea seemed to please Lupin immensely. There are certain\r\ncircumstances in which words are preferable to deeds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Sholmes, I am sorry I cannot offer you an easy chair. How\r\nwould you like that broken box? Or perhaps you would prefer the window\r\nledge? I am sure a glass of beer would be welcome ... light or dark?...\r\nBut sit down, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; we can talk as well standing up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be brief. The object of my sojourn in France was not to\r\naccomplish your arrest. If I have been led to pursue you, it was\r\nbecause I saw no other way to achieve my real object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo recover the blue diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blue diamond!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; since the one found in Herr Bleichen\xe2\x80\x99s tooth-powder was\r\nonly an imitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right; the genuine diamond was taken by the blonde Lady. I made\r\nan exact duplicate of it and then, as I had designs on other jewels\r\nbelonging to the Countess and as the Consul Herr Bleichen was already\r\nunder suspicion, the aforesaid blonde Lady, in order to avert\r\nsuspicion, slipped the false stone into the aforesaid Consul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nluggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile you kept the genuine diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat diamond\xe2\x80\x94I want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry, but it is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have promised it to the Countess de Crozon. I must have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you get it, since it is in my possession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is precisely the reason\xe2\x80\x94because it is in your possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I am to give it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoluntarily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will buy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lupin, in an access of mirth, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are certainly an\r\nEnglishman. You treat this as a matter of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a matter of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? what is your offer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe liberty of Mademoiselle Destange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer liberty?... I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she was under arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give Monsieur Ganimard the necessary information. When deprived\r\nof your protection, she can readily be taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin laughed again, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear monsieur, you are offering me something you do not possess.\r\nMademoiselle Destange is in a place of safety, and has nothing to fear.\r\nYou must make me another offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman hesitated, visibly embarrassed and vexed. Then, placing\r\nhis hand on the shoulder of his adversary, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I should propose to you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy liberty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ... but I can leave the room to consult with Ganimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd leave me alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! mon dieu, what good would that be? The cursed mechanism will not\r\nwork,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, at the same time savagely pushing the moulding of\r\nthe mantel. He stifled a cry of surprise; this time fortune favored\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94the block of marble moved. It was his salvation; his hope of\r\nescape. In that event, why submit to the conditions imposed by Sholmes?\r\nHe paced up and down the room, as if he were considering his reply.\r\nThen, in his turn, he placed his hand on the shoulder of his adversary,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll things considered, Monsieur Sholmes, I prefer to do my own\r\nbusiness in my own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t require anyone\xe2\x80\x99s assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Ganimard gets his hand on you, it will be all over. You can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nescape from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, that is foolish. Every door and window is guarded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The one I will choose_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMere words! Your arrest is as good as made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no\xe2\x80\x94not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall keep the blue diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes looked at his watch, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is now ten minutes to three. At three o\xe2\x80\x99clock I shall call\r\nGanimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, we have ten minutes to chat. And to satisfy my curiosity,\r\nMonsieur Sholmes, I should like to know how you procured my address and\r\nmy name of Felix Davey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough his adversary\xe2\x80\x99s easy manner caused Sholmes some anxiety, he\r\nwas willing to give Lupin the desired information since it reflected\r\ncredit on his professional astuteness; so he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour address? I got it from the blonde Lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClotilde!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerself. Do you remember, yesterday morning, when I wished to take her\r\naway in the automobile, she telephoned to her dressmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I understood, later, that you were the dressmaker. And last\r\nnight, on the boat, by exercising my memory\xe2\x80\x94and my memory is something\r\nI have good reason to be proud of\xe2\x80\x94I was able to recollect the last two\r\nfigures of your telephone number\xe2\x80\x9473. Then, as I possessed a list of the\r\nhouses you had \xe2\x80\x98improved,\xe2\x80\x99 it was an easy matter, on my arrival in\r\nParis at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning, to search in the telephone\r\ndirectory and find there the name and address of Felix Davey. Having\r\nobtained that information, I asked the aid of Monsieur Ganimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable! I congratulate you. But how did you manage to catch the\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock train at Havre? How did you escape from _The Swallow_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ordered the captain not to reach Southampton before one o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nHe landed me there at midnight. I was able to catch the twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nboat for Havre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the captain betray me? I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he did not betray you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was his watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis watch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I put it ahead one hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the usual way, by turning the hands. We were sitting side by side,\r\ntalking, and I was telling him some funny stories.... Why! he never saw\r\nme do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo! a very clever trick. I shall not forget it. But the clock that\r\nwas hanging on the wall of the cabin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the clock was a more difficult matter, as my feet were tied, but\r\nthe sailor, who guarded me during the captain\xe2\x80\x99s absence, was kind\r\nenough to turn the hands for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe? Nonsense! He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the importance of his act. I told him I must\r\ncatch the first train for London, at any price, and ... he allowed\r\nhimself to be persuaded\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy means of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy means of a slight gift, which the excellent fellow, loyal and true\r\nto his master, intends to send to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mere trifle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blue diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blue diamond!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the false stone that you substituted for the Countess\xe2\x80\x99 diamond.\r\nShe gave it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden explosion of violent laughter. Lupin laughed until\r\nthe tears started in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon dieu, but it is funny! My false diamond palmed off on my innocent\r\nsailor! And the captain\xe2\x80\x99s watch! And the hands of the clock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes felt that the duel between him and Lupin was keener than ever.\r\nHis marvellous instinct warned him that, behind his adversary\xe2\x80\x99s display\r\nof mirth, there was a shrewd intellect debating the ways and means to\r\nescape. Gradually Lupin approached the Englishman, who recoiled, and,\r\nunconsciously, slipped his hand into his watch-pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Monsieur Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock, already? What a pity! We were enjoying our chat so\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting for your answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy answer? Mon dieu! but you are particular!... And so this is the\r\nlast move in our little game\xe2\x80\x94and the stake is my liberty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr the blue diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. It\xe2\x80\x99s your play. What are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI play the king,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, as he fired his revolver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I the ace,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lupin, as he struck at Sholmes with his fist.\r\n\r\nSholmes had fired into the air, as a signal to Ganimard, whose\r\nassistance he required. But Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s fist had caught Sholmes in the\r\nstomach, and caused him to double up with pain. Lupin rushed to the\r\nfireplace and set the marble slab in motion.... Too late! The door\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurrender, Lupin, or I fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard, doubtless stationed closer than Lupin had thought, Ganimard\r\nwas there, with his revolver turned on Lupin. And behind Ganimard there\r\nwere twenty men, strong and ruthless fellows, who would beat him like a\r\ndog at the least sign of resistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHands down! I surrender!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, calmly; and he folded his arms\r\nacross his breast.\r\n\r\nEveryone was amazed. In the room, divested of its furniture and\r\nhangings, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s words sounded like an echo.... \xe2\x80\x9cI surrender!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n... It seemed incredible. No one would have been astonished if he had\r\nsuddenly vanished through a trap, or if a section of the wall had\r\nrolled away and allowed him to escape. But he surrendered!\r\n\r\nGanimard advanced, nervously, and with all the gravity that the\r\nimportance of the occasion demanded, he placed his hand on the shoulder\r\nof his adversary, and had the infinite pleasure of saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI arrest you, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrrr!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, \xe2\x80\x9cyou make me shiver, my dear Ganimard. What a\r\nlugubrious face! One would imagine you were speaking over the grave of\r\na friend. For Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t assume such a funereal air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI arrest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let that worry you! In the name of the law, of which he is a\r\nwell-deserving pillar, Ganimard, the celebrated Parisian detective,\r\narrests the wicked Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. An historic event, of which you will\r\nappreciate the true importance.... And it is the second time that it\r\nhas happened. Bravo, Ganimard, you are sure of advancement in your\r\nchosen profession!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he held out his wrists for the hand-cuffs. Ganimard adjusted them\r\nin a most solemn manner. The numerous policemen, despite their\r\ncustomary presumption and the bitterness of their feelings toward\r\nLupin, conducted themselves with becoming modesty, astonished at being\r\npermitted to gaze upon that mysterious and intangible creature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Lupin,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed our hero, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would your aristocratic friends\r\nsay if they should see you in this humiliating position?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pulled his wrists apart with all his strength. The veins in his\r\nforehead expanded. The links of the chain cut into his flesh. The chain\r\nfell off\xe2\x80\x94broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother, comrades, that one was useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey placed two on him this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot be too careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, counting the detectives and policemen, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many are you, my friends? Twenty-five? Thirty? That\xe2\x80\x99s too many. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. Ah! if there had been only fifteen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something fascinating about Lupin; it was the fascination of\r\nthe great actor who plays his r\xc3\xb4le with spirit and understanding,\r\ncombined with assurance and ease. Sholmes regarded him as one might\r\nregard a beautiful painting with a due appreciation of all its\r\nperfection in coloring and technique. And he really thought that it was\r\nan equal struggle between those thirty men on one side, armed as they\r\nwere with all the strength and majesty of the law, and, on the other\r\nside, that solitary individual, unarmed and handcuffed. Yes, the two\r\nsides were well-matched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin to the Englishman, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is your work.\r\nThanks to you, Lupin is going to rot on the damp straw of a dungeon.\r\nConfess that your conscience pricks you a little, and that your soul is\r\nfilled with remorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself, Sholmes shrugged his shoulders, as if to say:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your own fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! never!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cGive you the blue diamond? Oh! no, it\r\nhas cost me too much trouble. I intend to keep it. On my occasion of my\r\nfirst visit to you in London\xe2\x80\x94which will probably be next month\xe2\x80\x94I will\r\ntell you my reasons. But will you be in London next month? Or do you\r\nprefer Vienna? Or Saint Petersburg?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Lupin received a surprise. A bell commenced to ring. It was not\r\nthe alarm-bell, but the bell of the telephone which was located between\r\nthe two windows of the room and had not yet been removed.\r\n\r\nThe telephone! Ah! Who could it be? Who was about to fall into this\r\nunfortunate trap? Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin exhibited an access of rage against the\r\nunlucky instrument as if he would like to break it into a thousand\r\npieces and thus stifle the mysterious voice that was calling for him.\r\nBut it was Ganimard who took down the receiver, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!... Hello!... number 648.73 ... yes, this is it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Sholmes stepped up, and, with an air of authority, pushed Ganimard\r\naside, took the receiver, and covered the transmitter with his\r\nhandkerchief in order to obscure the tone of his voice. At that moment\r\nhe glanced toward Lupin, and the look which they exchanged indicated\r\nthat the same idea had occurred to each of them, and that they foresaw\r\nthe ultimate result of that theory: it was the blonde Lady who was\r\ntelephoning. She wished to telephone to Felix Davey, or rather to\r\nMaxime Bermond, and it was to Sholmes she was about to speak. The\r\nEnglishman said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello ... Hello!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, after a silence, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is I, Maxime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe drama had commenced and was progressing with tragic precision.\r\nLupin, the irrepressible and nonchalant Lupin, did not attempt to\r\nconceal his anxiety, and he strained every nerve in a desire to hear\r\nor, at least, to divine the purport of the conversation. And Sholmes\r\ncontinued, in reply to the mysterious voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!... Hello!... Yes, everything has been moved, and I am just\r\nready to leave here and meet you as we agreed.... Where?... Where you\r\nare now.... Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he is here yet!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes stopped, seeking for words. It was clear that he was trying to\r\nquestion the girl without betraying himself, and that he was ignorant\r\nof her whereabouts. Moreover, Ganimard\xe2\x80\x99s presence seemed to embarrass\r\nhim.... Ah! if some miracle would only interrupt that cursed\r\nconversation! Lupin prayed for it with all his strength, with all the\r\nintensity of his incited nerves! After a momentary pause, Sholmes\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!... Hello!... Do you hear me?... I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you very well....\r\nCan scarcely make out what you say.... Are you listening? Well, I think\r\nyou had better return home.... No danger now.... But he is in England!\r\nI have received a telegram from Southampton announcing his arrival.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sarcasm of those words! Sholmes uttered them with an inexpressible\r\ncomfort. And he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, don\xe2\x80\x99t lose any time. I will meet you there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hung up the receiver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Ganimard, can you furnish me with three men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the blonde Lady, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know who she is, and where she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! That settles Monsieur Lupin.... Folenfant, take two men, and go\r\nwith Monsieur Sholmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman departed, accompanied by the three men.\r\n\r\nThe game was ended. The blonde Lady was, also, about to fall into the\r\nhands of the Englishman. Thanks to his commendable persistence and to a\r\ncombination of fortuitous circumstances, the battle had resulted in a\r\nvictory for the detective, and in irreparable disaster for Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Sholmes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin was clearly shattered by this final blow. His forehead was marked\r\nby deep wrinkles. He was sullen and dejected. However, he pulled\r\nhimself together, and, notwithstanding his defeat, he exclaimed, in a\r\ncheerful tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will concede that fate has been against me. A few minutes ago, it\r\nprevented my escape through that chimney, and delivered me into your\r\nhands. Now, by means of the telephone, it presents you with the blonde\r\nLady. I submit to its decrees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that I am ready to re-open our negotiation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes took Ganimard aside and asked, in a manner that did not permit\r\na reply, the authority to exchange a few words with the prisoner. Then\r\nhe approached Lupin, and said, in a sharp, nervous tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Destange\xe2\x80\x99s liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you accept?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I accept your terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman, in surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cbut ... you refused ... for\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can look out for myself, Monsieur Sholmes, but now the question\r\nconcerns a young woman ... and a woman I love. In France, understand,\r\nwe have very decided ideas about such things. And Lupin has the same\r\nfeelings as other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with simplicity and candor. Sholmes replied by an almost\r\nimperceptible inclination of his head, and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, the blue diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my cane, there, at the end of the mantel. Press on the head of\r\nthe cane with one hand, and, with the other, turn the iron ferrule at\r\nthe bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolmes took the cane and followed the directions. As he did so, the\r\nhead of the cane divided and disclosed a cavity which contained a small\r\nball of wax which, in turn, enclosed a diamond. He examined it. It was\r\nthe blue diamond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Lupin, Mademoiselle Destange is free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs her future safety assured? Has she nothing to fear from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither from me, nor anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you manage it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite easily. I have forgotten her name and address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. And au revoir\xe2\x80\x94for I will see you again, sometime, Monsieur\r\nSholmes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen followed an animated conversation between Sholmes and Ganimard,\r\nwhich was abruptly terminated by the Englishman, who said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry, Monsieur Ganimard, that we cannot agree on that\r\npoint, but I have no time to waste trying to convince you. I leave for\r\nEngland within an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ... the blonde Lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know such a person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, a moment ago\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must take the affair as it stands. I have delivered Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\ninto your hands. Here is the blue diamond, which you will have the\r\npleasure of returning to the Countess de Crozon. What more do you\r\nwant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blonde Lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes pulled his cap down over his forehead and walked rapidly away,\r\nlike a man who is accustomed to go as soon as his business is finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBon voyage, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lupin, \xe2\x80\x9cand, believe me, I shall never\r\nforget the friendly way in which our little business affairs have been\r\narranged. My regards to Monsieur Wilson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot receiving any reply, Lupin added, sneeringly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what is called \xe2\x80\x98taking British leave.\xe2\x80\x99 Ah! their insular\r\ndignity lacks the flower of courtesy by which we are distinguished.\r\nConsider for a moment, Ganimard, what a charming exit a Frenchman would\r\nhave made under similar circumstances! With what exquisite courtesy he\r\nwould have masked his triumph!... But, God bless me, Ganimard, what are\r\nyou doing? Making a search? Come, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use? There is nothing\r\nleft\xe2\x80\x94not even a scrap of paper. I assure you my archives are in a safe\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cI must search\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin submitted to the operation. Held by two detectives and surrounded\r\nby the others, he patiently endured the proceedings for twenty minutes,\r\nthen he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry up, Ganimard, and finish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am. An important appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the police station?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; in the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! at what time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is three o\xe2\x80\x99clock now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so; I will be late. And punctuality is one of my virtues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, give me five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a second more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am doing my best to expedite\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so much.... Still searching that cupboard? It is\r\nempty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are some letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld invoices, I presume!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; a packet tied with a ribbon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA red ribbon? Oh! Ganimard, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t untie it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman of the world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Ganimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery funny! very funny!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the detective.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the men, who had been sent to search the other rooms,\r\nreturned and announced their failure to find anything. Lupin laughed\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu! Did you expect to find my visiting list, or evidence of my\r\nbusiness relations with the Emperor of Germany? But I can tell you what\r\nyou should investigate, Ganimard: All the little mysteries of this\r\napartment. For instance, that gas-pipe is a speaking tube. That chimney\r\ncontains a stairway. That wall is hollow. And the marvellous system of\r\nbells! Ah! Ganimard, just press that button!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear anything?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither did I. And yet you notified my aeronaut to prepare the\r\ndirigible balloon which will soon carry us into the clouds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard, who had completed his search; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough\r\nnonsense\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s be off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started away, followed by his men. Lupin did not move. His guardians\r\npushed him in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you refuse to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. But it depends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you want to take me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the station-house, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I refuse to go. I have no business there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you crazy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I not tell you that I had an important appointment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLupin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Ganimard, I have an appointment with the blonde Lady, and do you\r\nsuppose I would be so discourteous as to cause her a moment\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety?\r\nThat would be very ungentlemanly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Lupin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the detective, who was becoming annoyed by this\r\npersiflage; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been very patient with you, but I will endure no\r\nmore. Follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible; I have an appointment and I shall keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last time\xe2\x80\x94follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIm-pos-sible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a sign from Ganimard two men seized Lupin by the arms; but they\r\nreleased him at once, uttering cries of pain. Lupin had thrust two long\r\nneedles into them. The other men now rushed at Lupin with cries of rage\r\nand hatred, eager to avenge their comrades and to avenge themselves for\r\nthe many affronts he had heaped upon them; and now they struck and beat\r\nhim to their heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire. A violent blow on the temple felled Lupin\r\nto the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you hurt him you will answer to me,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Ganimard, in a rage.\r\n\r\nHe leaned over Lupin to ascertain his condition. Then, learning that he\r\nwas breathing freely, Ganimard ordered his men to carry the prisoner by\r\nthe head and feet, while he himself supported the body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo gently, now!... Don\xe2\x80\x99t jolt him. Ah! the brutes would have killed\r\nhim.... Well, Lupin, how goes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone too well, Ganimard ... you let them knock me out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was your own fault; you were so obstinate,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nI hope they didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had left the apartment and were now on the landing. Lupin groaned\r\nand stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGanimard ... the elevator ... they are breaking my bones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good idea, an excellent idea,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, the\r\nstairway is too narrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe summoned the elevator. They placed Lupin on the seat with the\r\ngreatest care. Ganimard took his place beside him and said to his men:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo down the stairs and wait for me below. Understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard closed the door of the elevator. Suddenly the elevator shot\r\nupward like a balloon released from its cable. Lupin burst into a fit\r\nof sardonic laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ganimard, as he made a frantic search in the dark for\r\nthe button of descent. Having found it, he cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fifth floor! Watch the door of the fifth floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis assistants clambered up the stairs, two and three steps at a time.\r\nBut this strange circumstance happened: The elevator seemed to break\r\nthrough the ceiling of the last floor, disappeared from the sight of\r\nGanimard\xe2\x80\x99s assistants, suddenly made its appearance on the upper\r\nfloor\xe2\x80\x94the servants\xe2\x80\x99 floor\xe2\x80\x94and stopped. Three men were there waiting for\r\nit. They opened the door. Two of them seized Ganimard, who, astonished\r\nat the sudden attack, scarcely made any defence. The other man carried\r\noff Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warned you, Ganimard ... about the dirigible balloon. Another time,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t be so tender-hearted. And, moreover, remember that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow himself to be struck and knocked down without sufficient\r\nreason. Adieu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door of the elevator was already closed on Ganimard, and the\r\nmachine began to descend; and it all happened so quickly that the old\r\ndetective reached the ground floor as soon as his assistants. Without\r\nexchanging a word they crossed the court and ascended the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstairway, which was the only way to reach the servants\xe2\x80\x99 floor through\r\nwhich the escape had been made.\r\n\r\nA long corridor with several turns and bordered with little numbered\r\nrooms led to a door that was not locked. On the other side of this door\r\nand, therefore, in another house there was another corridor with\r\nsimilar turns and similar rooms, and at the end of it a servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstairway. Ganimard descended it, crossed a court and a vestibule and\r\nfound himself in the rue Picot. Then he understood the situation: the\r\ntwo houses, built the entire depth of the lots, touched at the rear,\r\nwhile the fronts of the houses faced upon two streets that ran parallel\r\nto each other at a distance of more than sixty metres apart.\r\n\r\nHe found the concierge and, showing his card, enquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid four men pass here just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; the two servants from the fourth and fifth floors, with two\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho lives on the fourth and fifth floors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo men named Fauvel and their cousins, whose name is Provost. They\r\nmoved to-day, leaving the two servants, who went away just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ganimard; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a grand opportunity we have missed! The\r\nentire band lived in these houses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he sank down on a chair in despair.\r\n\r\n\r\nForty minutes later two gentlemen were driven up to the station of the\r\nNorthern Railway and hurried to the Calais express, followed by a\r\nporter who carried their valises. One of them had his arm in a sling,\r\nand the pallor of his face denoted some illness. The other man was in a\r\njovial mood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must hurry, Wilson, or we will miss the train.... Ah! Wilson, I\r\nshall never forget these ten days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither will I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it was a great struggle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuperb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few repulses, here and there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf no consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, at last, victory all along the line. Lupin arrested! The blue\r\ndiamond recovered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy arm broken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does a broken arm count for in such a victory as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially when it is my arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember, Wilson, that it was at the very time you\r\nwere in the pharmacy, suffering like a hero, that I discovered the clue\r\nto the whole mystery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow lucky!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doors of the carriages were being closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll aboard. Hurry up, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe porter climbed into an empty compartment and placed their valises\r\nin the rack, whilst Sholmes assisted the unfortunate Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Wilson? You\xe2\x80\x99re not done up, are you? Come, pull\r\nyour nerves together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy nerves are all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only one hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not the only one\r\nwho has had a broken arm. Cheer up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes handed the porter a piece of fifty centimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Monsieur Sholmes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the porter.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman looked at him; it was Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!... you!\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered, absolutely astounded.\r\n\r\nAnd Wilson brandished his sound arm in the manner of a man who\r\ndemonstrates a fact as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! you! but you were arrested! Sholmes told me so. When he left you\r\nGanimard and thirty men had you in charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin folded his arms and said, with an air of indignation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you suppose I would let you go away without bidding you adieu?\r\nAfter the very friendly relations that have always existed between us!\r\nThat would be discourteous and ungrateful on my part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train whistled. Lupin continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, but have you everything you need? Tobacco and\r\nmatches ... yes ... and the evening papers? You will find in them an\r\naccount of my arrest\xe2\x80\x94your last exploit, Monsieur Sholmes. And now, au\r\nrevoir. Am delighted to have made your acquaintance. And if ever I can\r\nbe of any service to you, I shall be only too happy....\xe2\x80\x9d He leaped to\r\nthe platform and closed the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, waving his handkerchief. \xe2\x80\x9cAdieu.... I shall write\r\nto you.... You will write also, eh? And your arm broken, Wilson.... I\r\nam truly sorry.... I shall expect to hear from both of you. A postal\r\ncard, now and then, simply address: Lupin, Paris. That is\r\nsufficient.... Adieu.... See you soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE JEWISH LAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes and Wilson were sitting in front of the fireplace, in\r\ncomfortable armchairs, with the feet extended toward the grateful\r\nwarmth of a glowing coke fire.\r\n\r\nSholmes\xe2\x80\x99 pipe, a short brier with a silver band, had gone out. He\r\nknocked out the ashes, filled it, lighted it, pulled the skirts of his\r\ndressing-gown over his knees, and drew from his pipe great puffs of\r\nsmoke, which ascended toward the ceiling in scores of shadow rings.\r\n\r\nWilson gazed at him, as a dog lying curled up on a rug before the fire\r\nmight look at his master, with great round eyes which have no hope\r\nother than to obey the least gesture of his owner. Was the master going\r\nto break the silence? Would he reveal to Wilson the subject of his\r\nreverie and admit his satellite into the charmed realm of his thoughts?\r\n\r\nWhen Sholmes had maintained his silent attitude for some time. Wilson\r\nventured to speak:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything seems quiet now. Not the shadow of a case to occupy our\r\nleisure moments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes did not reply, but the rings of smoke emitted by Sholmes were\r\nbetter formed, and Wilson observed that his companion drew considerable\r\npleasure from that trifling fact\xe2\x80\x94an indication that the great man was\r\nnot absorbed in any serious meditation. Wilson, discouraged, arose and\r\nwent to the window.\r\n\r\nThe lonely street extended between the gloomy fa\xc3\xa7ades of grimy houses,\r\nunusually gloomy this morning by reason of a heavy downfall of rain. A\r\ncab passed; then another. Wilson made an entry of their numbers in his\r\nmemorandum-book. One never knows!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe postman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man entered, shown in by the servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo registered letters, sir ... if you will sign, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes signed the receipts, accompanied the man to the door, and was\r\nopening one of the letters as he returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to please you,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Wilson, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis letter contains a very interesting proposition. You are anxious\r\nfor a case\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s one. Read\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI desire the benefit of your services and experience. I have been\r\n    the victim of a serious theft, and the investigation has as yet\r\n    been unsuccessful. I am sending to you by this mail a number of\r\n    newspapers which will inform you of the affair, and if you will\r\n    undertake the case, I will place my house at your disposal and ask\r\n    you to fill in the enclosed check, signed by me, for whatever sum\r\n    you require for your expenses.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cKindly reply by telegraph, and much oblige,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour humble servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaron Victor d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c18 rue Murillo, Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cthat sounds good ... a little trip to Paris\r\n... and why not, Wilson? Since my famous duel with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, I have\r\nnot had an excuse to go there. I should be pleased to visit the capital\r\nof the world under less strenuous conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tore the check into four pieces and, while Wilson, whose arm had not\r\nyet regained its former strength, uttered bitter words against Paris\r\nand the Parisians, Sholmes opened the second envelope. Immediately, he\r\nmade a gesture of annoyance, and a wrinkle appeared on his forehead\r\nduring the reading of the letter; then, crushing the paper into a ball,\r\nhe threw it, angrily, on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wilson, anxiously.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the ball of paper, unfolded it, and read, with increasing\r\namazement:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Monsieur:\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou know full well the admiration I have for you and the interest\r\n    I take in your renown. Well, believe me, when I warn you to have\r\n    nothing whatever to do with the case on which you have just now\r\n    been called to Paris. Your intervention will cause much harm; your\r\n    efforts will produce a most lamentable result; and you will be\r\n    obliged to make a public confession of your defeat.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHaving a sincere desire to spare you such humiliation, I implore\r\n    you, in the name of the friendship that unites us, to remain\r\n    peacefully reposing at your own fireside.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMy best wishes to Monsieur Wilson, and, for yourself, the sincere\r\n    regards of your devoted\r\n\r\n\r\nARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Wilson, astounded.\r\n\r\nSholmes struck the table with his fist, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! he is pestering me already, the fool! He laughs at me as if I were\r\na schoolboy! The public confession of my defeat! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I force him to\r\ndisgorge the blue diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is not afraid, and this taunting letter proves\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did he know that the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle had written to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I know about it? You do ask some stupid questions, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought ... I supposed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? That I am a clairvoyant? Or a sorcerer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I have seen you do some marvellous things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo person can perform _marvellous_ things. I no more than you. I\r\nreflect, I deduct, I conclude\xe2\x80\x94that is all; but I do not divine. Only\r\nfools divine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson assumed the attitude of a whipped cur, and resolved not to make\r\na fool of himself by trying to divine why Sholmes paced the room with\r\nquick, nervous strides. But when Sholmes rang for the servant and\r\nordered his valise, Wilson thought that he was in possession of a\r\nmaterial fact which gave him the right to reflect, deduct and conclude\r\nthat his associate was about to take a journey. The same mental\r\noperation permitted him to assert, with almost mathematical exactness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSholmes, you are going to Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s affront impels you to go, rather than the desire to assist\r\nthe Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSholmes, I shall go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh; ah! my old friend,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, interrupting his walking,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are not afraid that your right arm will meet the same fate as your\r\nleft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can happen to me? You will be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way to talk, Wilson. We will show that clever Frenchman\r\nthat he made a mistake when he threw his glove in our faces. Be quick,\r\nWilson, we must catch the first train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout waiting for the papers the baron has sent you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will send a telegram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; if you do that, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin will know of my arrival. I wish to\r\navoid that. This time, Wilson, we must fight under cover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, the two friends embarked at Dover. The passage was a\r\ndelightful one. In the train from Calais to Paris, Sholmes had three\r\nhours sound sleep, while Wilson guarded the door of the compartment.\r\n\r\nSholmes awoke in good spirits. He was delighted at the idea of another\r\nduel with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, and he rubbed his hands with the satisfied air\r\nof a man who looks forward to a pleasant vacation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wilson, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are getting to work again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he rubbed his hands with the same satisfied air.\r\n\r\nAt the station, Sholmes took the wraps and, followed by Wilson, who\r\ncarried the valises, he gave up his tickets and started off briskly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine weather, Wilson.... Blue sky and sunshine! Paris is giving us a\r\nroyal reception.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but what a crowd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better, Wilson, we will pass unnoticed. No one will\r\nrecognize us in such a crowd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this Monsieur Sholmes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, somewhat puzzled. Who the deuce could thus address him by\r\nhis name? A woman stood beside him; a young girl whose simple dress\r\noutlined her slender form and whose pretty face had a sad and anxious\r\nexpression. She repeated her enquiry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Monsieur Sholmes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he still remained silent, as much from confusion as from a habit of\r\nprudence, the girl asked a third time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I the honor of addressing Monsieur Sholmes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, testily, considering the incident a\r\nsuspicious one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must listen to me, Monsieur Sholmes, as it is a serious matter. I\r\nknow that you are going to the rue Murillo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know ... I know ... rue Murillo ... number 18. Well, you must not go\r\n... no, you must not. I assure you that you will regret it. Do not\r\nthink that I have any interest in the matter. I do it because it is\r\nright ... because my conscience tells me to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes tried to get away, but she persisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I beg of you, don\xe2\x80\x99t neglect my advice.... Ah! if I only knew how\r\nto convince you! Look at me! Look into my eyes! They are sincere ...\r\nthey speak the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gazed at Sholmes, fearlessly but innocently, with those beautiful\r\neyes, serious and clear, in which her very soul seemed to be reflected.\r\n\r\nWilson nodded his head, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle looks honest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she implored, \xe2\x80\x9cand you must have confidence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have confidence in you, mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wilson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how happy you make me! And so has your friend? I feel it ... I am\r\nsure of it! What happiness! Everything will be all right now!... What a\r\ngood idea of mine!... Ah! yes, there is a train for Calais in twenty\r\nminutes. You will take it.... Quick, follow me ... you must come this\r\nway ... there is just time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to drag them along. Sholmes seized her arm, and in as gentle\r\na voice as he could assume, said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, mademoiselle, if I cannot yield to your wishes, but I never\r\nabandon a task that I have once undertaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beseech you ... I implore you.... Ah if you could only understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes passed outside and walked away at a quick pace. Wilson said to\r\nthe girl:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave no fear ... he will be in at the finish. He never failed yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he ran to overtake Sholmes.\r\n\r\nHERLOCK SHOLMES\xe2\x80\x94ARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN.\r\n\r\nThese words, in great black letters, met their gaze as soon as they\r\nleft the railway station. A number of sandwich-men were parading\r\nthrough the street, one behind the other, carrying heavy canes with\r\niron ferrules with which they struck the pavement in harmony, and, on\r\ntheir backs, they carried large posters, on which one could read the\r\nfollowing notice:\r\n\r\nTHE MATCH BETWEEN HERLOCK SHOLMES\r\nAND ARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN. ARRIVAL OF THE ENGLISH\r\nCHAMPION. THE GREAT DETECTIVE ATTACKS\r\nTHE MYSTERY OF THE RUE MURILLO. READ THE\r\nDETAILS IN THE \xe2\x80\x9cECHO DE FRANCE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWilson shook his head, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that, Sholmes, and we thought we were traveling incognito! I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to find the republican guard waiting for us at\r\nthe rue Murillo to give us an official reception with toasts and\r\nchampagne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, when you get funny, you get beastly funny,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Sholmes.\r\n\r\nThen he approached one of the sandwich-men with the obvious intention\r\nof seizing him in his powerful grip and crushing him, together with his\r\ninfernal sign-board. There was quite a crowd gathered about the men,\r\nreading the notices, and joking and laughing.\r\n\r\nRepressing a furious access of rage, Sholmes said to the man:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did they hire you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been parading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the boards were ready before that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, they were ready when we went to the agency this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then it appears that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had foreseen that he, Sholmes,\r\nwould accept the challenge. More than that, the letter written by Lupin\r\nshowed that he was eager for the fray and that he was prepared to\r\nmeasure swords once more with his formidable rival. Why? What motive\r\ncould Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin have in renewing the struggle?\r\n\r\nSholmes hesitated for a moment. Lupin must be very confident of his\r\nsuccess to show so much insolence in advance; and was not he, Sholmes,\r\nfalling into a trap by rushing into the battle at the first call for\r\nhelp?\r\n\r\nHowever, he called a carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Wilson!... Driver, 18 rue Murillo!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with an\r\noutburst of his accustomed energy. With distended veins and clenched\r\nfists, as if he were about to engage in a boxing bout, he jumped into\r\nthe carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rue Murillo is bordered with magnificent private residences, the\r\nrear of which overlook the Parc Monceau. One of the most pretentious of\r\nthese houses is number 18, owned and occupied by the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle\r\nand furnished in a luxurious manner consistent with the owner\xe2\x80\x99s taste\r\nand wealth. There was a courtyard in front of the house, and, in the\r\nrear, a garden well filled with trees whose branches mingle with those\r\nof the park.\r\n\r\nAfter ringing the bell, the two Englishmen were admitted, crossed the\r\ncourtyard, and were received at the door by a footman who showed them\r\ninto a small parlor facing the garden in the rear of the house. They\r\nsat down and, glancing about, made a rapid inspection of the many\r\nvaluable objects with which the room was filled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything very choice,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Wilson, \xe2\x80\x9cand in the best of taste.\r\nIt is a safe deduction to make that those who had the leisure to\r\ncollect these articles must now be at least fifty years of age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle entered, followed by his\r\nwife. Contrary to the deduction made by Wilson, they were both quite\r\nyoung, of elegant appearance, and vivacious in speech and action. They\r\nwere profuse in their expressions of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo kind of you to come! Sorry to have caused you so much trouble! The\r\ntheft now seems of little consequence, since it has procured us this\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow charming these French people are!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Wilson, evolving one of\r\nhis commonplace deductions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut time is money,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the baron, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially your time,\r\nMonsieur Sholmes. So I will come to the point. Now, what do you think\r\nof the affair? Do you think you can succeed in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I can answer that I must know what it is about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; so I must ask you for full particulars, even to the smallest\r\ndetail. First, what is the nature of the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA theft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did it take place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast Saturday,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the baron, \xe2\x80\x9cor, at least, some time during\r\nSaturday night or Sunday morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was six days ago. Now, you can tell me all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, monsieur, I must tell you that my wife and I,\r\nconforming to the manner of life that our position demands, go out very\r\nlittle. The education of our children, a few receptions, and the care\r\nand decoration of our house\xe2\x80\x94such constitutes our life; and nearly all\r\nour evenings are spent in this little room, which is my wife\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir,\r\nand in which we have gathered a few artistic objects. Last Saturday\r\nnight, about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I turned off the electric lights, and my\r\nwife and I retired, as usual, to our room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt adjoins this. That is the door. Next morning, that is to say,\r\nSunday morning, I arose quite early. As Suzanne, my wife, was still\r\nasleep, I passed into the boudoir as quietly as possible so as not to\r\nwake her. What was my astonishment when I found that window open\xe2\x80\x94as we\r\nhad left it closed the evening before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA servant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one enters here in the morning until we ring. Besides, I always\r\ntake the precaution to bolt the second door which communicates with the\r\nante-chamber. Therefore, the window must have been opened from the\r\noutside. Besides, I have some evidence of that: the second pane of\r\nglass from the right\xe2\x80\x94close to the fastening\xe2\x80\x94had been cut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does that window overlook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you can see for yourself, it opens on a little balcony, surrounded\r\nby a stone railing. Here, we are on the first floor, and you can see\r\nthe garden behind the house and the iron fence which separates it from\r\nthe Parc Monceau. It is quite certain that the thief came through the\r\npark, climbed the fence by the aid of a ladder, and thus reached the\r\nterrace below the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is quite certain, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in the soft earth on either side of the fence, they found the\r\ntwo holes made by the bottom of the ladder, and two similar holes can\r\nbe seen below the window. And the stone railing of the balcony shows\r\ntwo scratches which were doubtless made by the contact of the ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the Parc Monceau closed at night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but if it were, there is a house in course of erection at number\r\n14, and a person could enter that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes reflected for a few minutes, and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us come down to the theft. It must have been committed in this\r\nroom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; there was here, between that twelfth century Virgin and that\r\ntabernacle of chased silver, a small Jewish lamp. It has disappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!... And what is a Jewish lamp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of those copper lamps used by the ancient Jews, consisting of a\r\nstandard which supported a bowl containing the oil, and from this bowl\r\nprojected several burners intended for the wicks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon the whole, an object of small value.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo great value, of course. But this one contained a secret\r\nhiding-place in which we were accustomed to place a magnificent jewel,\r\na chimera in gold, set with rubies and emeralds, which was of great\r\nvalue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you hide it there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I can\xe2\x80\x99t give any reason, monsieur, unless it was an odd fancy to\r\nutilize a hiding-place of that kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid anyone know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one\xe2\x80\x94except the thief,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise he would not have\r\ntaken the trouble to steal the lamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. But how could he know it, as it was only by accident that\r\nthe secret mechanism of the lamp was revealed to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA similar accident has revealed it to some one else ... a servant ...\r\nor an acquaintance. But let us proceed: I suppose the police have been\r\nnotified?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The examining magistrate has completed his investigation. The\r\nreporter-detectives attached to the leading newspapers have also made\r\ntheir investigations. But, as I wrote to you, it seems to me the\r\nmystery will never be solved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes arose, went to the window, examined the casement, the balcony,\r\nthe terrace, studied the scratches on the stone railing with his\r\nmagnifying-glass, and then requested Mon. d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle to show him the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nOutside, Sholmes sat down in a rattan chair and gazed at the roof of\r\nthe house in a dreamy way. Then he walked over to the two little wooden\r\nboxes with which they had covered the holes made in the ground by the\r\nbottom of the ladder with a view of preserving them intact. He raised\r\nthe boxes, kneeled on the ground, scrutinized the holes and made some\r\nmeasurements. After making a similar examination of the holes near the\r\nfence, he and the baron returned to the boudoir where Madame\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle was waiting for them. After a short silence Sholmes said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the very outset of your story, baron, I was surprised at the very\r\nsimple methods employed by the thief. To raise a ladder, cut a\r\nwindow-pane, select a valuable article, and walk out again\xe2\x80\x94no, that is\r\nnot the way such things are done. All that is too plain, too simple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the Jewish lamp was stolen under the direction of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the baron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he did not do it himself, as no one came from the outside.\r\nPerhaps a servant descended from the upper floor by means of a\r\nwaterspout that I noticed when I was in the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin would not leave this room empty-handed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmpty-handed! But he had the lamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that would not have prevented his taking that snuff-box, set with\r\ndiamonds, or that opal necklace. When he leaves anything, it is because\r\nhe can\xe2\x80\x99t carry it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the marks of the ladder outside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA false scent. Placed there simply to avert suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the scratches on the balustrade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA farce! They were made with a piece of sandpaper. See, here are\r\nscraps of the paper that I picked up in the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about the marks made by the bottom of the ladder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCounterfeit! Examine the two rectangular holes below the window, and\r\nthe two holes near the fence. They are of a similar form, but I find\r\nthat the two holes near the house are closer to each other than the two\r\nholes near the fence. What does that fact suggest? To me, it suggested\r\nthat the four holes were made by a piece of wood prepared for the\r\npurpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better proof would be the piece of wood itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cI found it in the garden, under the box of\r\na laurel tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baron bowed to Sholmes in recognition of his skill. Only forty\r\nminutes had elapsed since the Englishman had entered the house, and he\r\nhad already exploded all the theories theretofore formed, and which had\r\nbeen based on what appeared to be obvious and undeniable facts. But\r\nwhat now appeared to be the real facts of the case rested upon a more\r\nsolid foundation, to-wit, the astute reasoning of a Herlock Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe accusation which you make against one of our household is a very\r\nserious matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cOur servants have been with us a\r\nlong time and none of them would betray our trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf none of them has betrayed you, how can you explain the fact that I\r\nreceived this letter on the same day and by the same mail as the letter\r\nyou wrote to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed to the baroness the letter that he had received from Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin. She exclaimed, in amazement:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! How could he know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you tell anyone that you had written to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the baron. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea occurred to us the other evening\r\nat the dinner-table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the servants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, only our two children. Oh, no ... Sophie and Henriette had left\r\nthe table, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t they, Suzanne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they had gone to Mademoiselle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe governess, Mademoiselle Alice Demun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she take her meals with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Her meals are served in her room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson had an idea. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter written to my friend Herlock Sholmes was posted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho posted it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDominique, who has been my valet for twenty years,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the baron.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny search in that direction would be a waste of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne never wastes his time when engaged in a search,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson,\r\nsententiously.\r\n\r\nThis preliminary investigation now ended, and Sholmes asked permission\r\nto retire.\r\n\r\nAt dinner, an hour later, he saw Sophie and Henriette, the two children\r\nof the family, one was six and the other eight years of age. There was\r\nvery little conversation at the table. Sholmes responded to the\r\nfriendly advances of his hosts in such a curt manner that they were\r\nsoon reduced to silence. When the coffee was served, Sholmes swallowed\r\nthe contents of his cup, and rose to take his leave.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, a servant entered with a telephone message addressed to\r\nSholmes. He opened it, and read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have my enthusiastic admiration. The results attained by you in so\r\nshort a time are simply marvellous. I am dismayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSholmes made a gesture of indignation and handed the message to the\r\nbaron, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think now, monsieur? Are the walls of your house furnished\r\nwith eyes and ears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor do I; but I do understand that Lupin has knowledge of everything\r\nthat occurs in this house. He knows every movement, every word. There\r\nis no doubt of it. But how does he get his information? That is the\r\nfirst mystery I have to solve, and when I know that I will know\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night, Wilson retired with the clear conscience of a man who has\r\nperformed his whole duty and thus acquired an undoubted right to sleep\r\nand repose. So he fell asleep very quickly, and was soon enjoying the\r\nmost delightful dreams in which he pursued Lupin and captured him\r\nsingle-handed; and the sensation was so vivid and exciting that it woke\r\nhim from his sleep. Someone was standing at his bedside. He seized his\r\nrevolver, and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t move, Lupin, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce! Wilson, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is you, Sholmes. Do you want me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to show you something. Get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes led him to the window, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!... on the other side of the fence....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the park?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you do see something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! of course, a shadow ... two of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, close to the fence. See, they are moving. Come, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuickly they descended the stairs, and reached a room which opened into\r\nthe garden. Through the glass door they could see the two shadowy forms\r\nin the same place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very strange,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems to me I can hear a\r\nnoise inside the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInside the house? Impossible! Everybody is asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, listen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment a low whistle came from the other side of the fence, and\r\nthey perceived a dim light which appeared to come from the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe baron must have turned on the light in his room. It is just above\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must have been the noise you heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilson. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they\r\nare watching the fence also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen there was a second whistle, softer than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, irritably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more do I,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed Wilson.\r\n\r\nSholmes turned the key, drew the bolt, and quietly opened the door. A\r\nthird whistle, louder than before, and modulated to another form. And\r\nthe noise above their heads became more pronounced. Sholmes said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to be on the balcony outside the boudoir window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his head through the half-opened door, but immediately recoiled,\r\nwith a stifled oath. Then Wilson looked. Quite close to them there was\r\na ladder, the upper end of which was resting on the balcony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is someone in the boudoir. That is\r\nwhat we heard. Quick, let us remove the ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at that instant a man slid down the ladder and ran toward the spot\r\nwhere his accomplices were waiting for him outside the fence. He\r\ncarried the ladder with him. Sholmes and Wilson pursued the man and\r\novertook him just as he was placing the ladder against the fence. From\r\nthe other side of the fence two shots were fired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWounded?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wilson.\r\n\r\nWilson seized the man by the body and tried to hold him, but the man\r\nturned and plunged a knife into Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s breast. He uttered a groan,\r\nstaggered and fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamnation!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cif they have killed him I will kill\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid Wilson on the grass and rushed toward the ladder. Too late\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nman had climbed the fence and, accompanied by his confederates, had\r\nfled through the bushes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilson, Wilson, it is not serious, hein? Merely a scratch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe house door opened, and Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle appeared, followed by\r\nthe servants, carrying candles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the baron. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Monsieur Wilson wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\xe2\x80\x94a mere scratch,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Sholmes, trying to deceive\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe blood was flowing profusely, and Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s face was livid. Twenty\r\nminutes later the doctor ascertained that the point of the knife had\r\npenetrated to within an inch and a half of the heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn inch and a half of the heart! Wilson always was lucky!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSholmes, in an envious tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucky ... lucky....\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! Why, with his robust constitution he will soon be out\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix weeks in bed and two months of convalescence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, unless complications set in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the devil! what does he want complications for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFully reassured, Sholmes joined the baron in the boudoir. This time the\r\nmysterious visitor had not exercised the same restraint. Ruthlessly, he\r\nhad laid his vicious hand upon the diamond snuff-box, upon the opal\r\nnecklace, and, in a general way, upon everything that could find a\r\nplace in the greedy pockets of an enterprising burglar.\r\n\r\nThe window was still open; one of the window-panes had been neatly cut;\r\nand, in the morning, a summary investigation showed that the ladder\r\nbelonged to the house then in course of construction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you can see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mon. d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle, with a touch of irony, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis an exact repetition of the affair of the Jewish lamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if we accept the first theory adopted by the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you adopted it yet? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this second theft shatter your\r\ntheory in regard to the first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt only confirms it, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is incredible! You have positive evidence that last night\xe2\x80\x99s theft\r\nwas committed by an outsider, and yet you adhere to your theory that\r\nthe Jewish lamp was stolen by someone in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you explain it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not explain anything, monsieur; I have established two facts\r\nwhich do not appear to have any relation to each other, and yet I am\r\nseeking the missing link that connects them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis conviction seemed to be so earnest and positive that the baron\r\nsubmitted to it, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, we will notify the police\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Englishman, quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cnot at all! I intend\r\nto ask for their assistance when I need it\xe2\x80\x94but not before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the attack on your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence. He is only wounded. Secure the license of\r\nthe doctor. I shall be responsible for the legal side of the affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next two days proved uneventful. Yet Sholmes was investigating the\r\ncase with a minute care, and with a sense of wounded pride resulting\r\nfrom that audacious theft, committed under his nose, in spite of his\r\npresence and beyond his power to prevent it. He made a thorough\r\ninvestigation of the house and garden, interviewed the servants, and\r\npaid lengthy visits to the kitchen and stables. And, although his\r\nefforts were fruitless, he did not despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will succeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand the solution must be sought within\r\nthe walls of this house. This affair is quite different from that of\r\nthe blonde Lady, where I had to work in the dark, on unknown ground.\r\nThis time I am on the battlefield itself. The enemy is not the elusive\r\nand invisible Lupin, but the accomplice, in flesh and blood, who lives\r\nand moves within the confines of this house. Let me secure the\r\nslightest clue and the game is mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat clue was furnished to him by accident.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the third day, when he entered a room located above\r\nthe boudoir, which served as a study for the children, he found\r\nHenriette, the younger of the two sisters. She was looking for her\r\nscissors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cI make papers like that you received\r\nthe other evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just as dinner was over, you received a paper with marks on it\r\n... you know, a telegram.... Well, I make them, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left the room. To anyone else these words would seem to be nothing\r\nmore than the insignificant remark of a child, and Sholmes himself\r\nlistened to them with a distracted air and continued his investigation.\r\nBut, suddenly, he ran after the child, and overtook her at the head of\r\nthe stairs. He said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you paste stamps and marks on papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenriette, very proudly, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I cut them out and paste them on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho taught you that little game?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle ... my governess ... I have seen her do it often. She\r\ntakes words out of the newspapers and pastes them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she make out of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTelegrams and letters that she sends away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes returned to the study, greatly puzzled by the\r\ninformation and seeking to draw from it a logical deduction. There was\r\na pile of newspapers on the mantel. He opened them and found that many\r\nwords and, in some places, entire lines had been cut out. But, after\r\nreading a few of the word\xe2\x80\x99s which preceded or followed, he decided that\r\nthe missing words had been cut out at random\xe2\x80\x94probably by the child. It\r\nwas possible that one of the newspapers had been cut by mademoiselle;\r\nbut how could he assure himself that such was the case?\r\n\r\nMechanically, Sholmes turned over the school-books on the table; then\r\nothers which were lying on the shelf of a bookcase. Suddenly he uttered\r\na cry of joy. In a corner of the bookcase, under a pile of old exercise\r\nbooks, he found a child\xe2\x80\x99s alphabet-book, in which the letters were\r\nornamented with pictures, and on one of the pages of that book he\r\ndiscovered a place where a word had been removed. He examined it. It\r\nwas a list of the days of the week. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.\r\nThe word \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday\xe2\x80\x9d was missing. Now, the theft of the Jewish lamp had\r\noccurred on a Saturday night.\r\n\r\nSholmes experienced that slight fluttering of the heart which always\r\nannounced to him, in the clearest manner, that he had discovered the\r\nroad which leads to victory. That ray of truth, that feeling of\r\ncertainty, never deceived him.\r\n\r\nWith nervous fingers he hastened to examine the balance of the book.\r\nVery soon he made another discovery. It was a page composed of capital\r\nletters, followed by a line of figures. Nine of those letters and three\r\nof those figures had been carefully cut out. Sholmes made a list of the\r\nmissing letters and figures in his memorandum book, in alphabetical and\r\nnumerical order, and obtained the following result:\r\n\r\nCDEHNOPEZ\xe2\x80\x94237.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? at first sight, it is a rather formidable puzzle,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut, by transposing the letters and using all of them, is it possible\r\nto form one, two or three complete words?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes tried it, in vain.\r\n\r\nOnly one solution seemed possible; it constantly appeared before him,\r\nno matter which way he tried to juggle the letters, until, at length,\r\nhe was satisfied it was the true solution, since it harmonized with the\r\nlogic of the facts and the general circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nAs that page of the book did not contain any duplicate letters it was\r\nprobable, in fact quite certain, that the words he could form from\r\nthose letters would be incomplete, and that the original words had been\r\ncompleted with letters taken from other pages. Under those conditions\r\nhe obtained the following solution, errors and omissions excepted:\r\n\r\nREPOND Z\xe2\x80\x94CH\xe2\x80\x94237.\r\n\r\nThe first word was quite clear: r\xc3\xa9pondez [reply], a letter E is missing\r\nbecause it occurs twice in the word, and the book furnished only one\r\nletter of each kind.\r\n\r\nAs to the second incomplete word, no doubt it formed, with the aid of\r\nthe number 237, an address to which the reply was to be sent. They\r\nappointed Saturday as the time, and requested a reply to be sent to the\r\naddress CH. 237.\r\n\r\nOr, perhaps, CH. 237 was an address for a letter to be sent to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgeneral delivery\xe2\x80\x9d of some postoffice, or, again, they might form a\r\npart of some incomplete word. Sholmes searched the book once more, but\r\ndid not discover that any other letters had been removed. Therefore,\r\nuntil further orders, he decided to adhere to the foregoing\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nHenriette returned and observed what he was doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmusing, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very amusing,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, have you any other papers?...\r\nOr, rather, words already cut out that I can paste?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapers?... No.... And Mademoiselle wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she has scolded me already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have told you some things ... and she says that a person\r\nshould never tell things about those they love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenriette was delighted to receive his approbation, in fact so highly\r\npleased that she took from a little silk bag that was pinned to her\r\ndress some scraps of cloth, three buttons, two cubes of sugar and,\r\nlastly, a piece of paper which she handed to Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, I give it to you just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the number of a cab\xe2\x80\x948,279.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did this number come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt fell out of her pocketbook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSunday, at mass, when she was taking out some sous for the\r\ncollection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly! And now I shall tell you how to keep from being scolded\r\nagain. Do not tell Mademoiselle that you saw me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes then went to Mon. d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle and questioned him in regard to\r\nMademoiselle. The baron replied, indignantly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice Demun! How can you imagine such a thing? It is utterly\r\nimpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long has she been in your service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a year, but there is no one in the house in whom I have greater\r\nconfidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have I not seen her yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been away for a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she is here now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; since her return she has been watching at the bedside of your\r\nfriend. She has all the qualities of a nurse ... gentle ... thoughtful\r\n... Monsieur Wilson seems much pleased....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, who had completely neglected to inquire about his\r\nfriend. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she go out on Sunday morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day after the theft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baron called his wife and asked her. She replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle went to the eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock mass with the children, as\r\nusual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut before that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore that? No.... Let me see!... I was so upset by the theft ... but\r\nI remember now that, on the evening before, she asked permission to go\r\nout on Sunday morning ... to see a cousin who was passing through\r\nParis, I think. But, surely, you don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not ... but I would like to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s room. A woman dressed in a gray cloth dress, as in\r\nthe hospitals, was bending over the invalid, giving him a drink. When\r\nshe turned her face Sholmes recognized her as the young girl who had\r\naccosted him at the railway station.\r\n\r\nAlice Demun smiled sweetly; her great serious, innocent eyes showed no\r\nsign of embarrassment. The Englishman tried to speak, muttered a few\r\nsyllables, and stopped. Then she resumed her work, acting quite\r\nnaturally under Sholmes\xe2\x80\x99 astonished gaze, moved the bottles, unrolled\r\nand rolled cotton bandages, and again regarded Sholmes with her\r\ncharming smile of pure innocence.\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heels, descended the stairs, noticed Mon.\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle\xe2\x80\x99s automobile in the courtyard, jumped into it, and went to\r\nLevallois, to the office of the cab company whose address was printed\r\non the paper he had received from Henriette. The man who had driven\r\ncarriage number 8,279 on Sunday morning not being there, Sholmes\r\ndismissed the automobile and waited for the man\xe2\x80\x99s return. He told\r\nSholmes that he had picked up a woman in the vicinity of the Parc\r\nMonceau, a young woman dressed in black, wearing a heavy veil, and,\r\napparently, quite nervous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she have a package?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite a long package.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you take her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvenue des Ternes, corner of the Place Saint-Ferdinand. She remained\r\nthere about ten minutes, and then returned to the Parc Monceau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you recognize the house in the avenue des Ternes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu! Shall I take you there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresently. First take me to 36 quai des Orf\xc3\xa8vres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the police office he saw Detective Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Ganimard, are you at liberty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it has anything to do with Lupin\xe2\x80\x94no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has something to do with Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I do not go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you surrender\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bow to the inevitable. I am tired of the unequal struggle, in which\r\nwe are sure to be defeated. Lupin is stronger than I am\xe2\x80\x94stronger than\r\nthe two of us; therefore, we must surrender.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not surrender.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will make you, as he has all others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would be pleased to see it\xe2\x80\x94eh, Ganimard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events, it is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard, frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd since you are\r\ndetermined to pursue the game, I will go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTogether they entered the carriage and were driven to the avenue des\r\nTernes. Upon their order the carriage stopped on the other side of the\r\nstreet, at some distance from the house, in front of a little caf\xc3\xa9, on\r\nthe terrace of which the two men took seats amongst the shrubbery. It\r\nwas commencing to grow dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9csome writing material.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote a note, recalled the waiter and gave him the letter with\r\ninstructions to deliver it to the concierge of the house which he\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the concierge stood before them. Sholmes asked him if,\r\non the Sunday morning, he had seen a young woman dressed in black.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn black? Yes, about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. She went to the second floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen her often?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but for some time\xe2\x80\x94well, during the last few weeks, I have seen her\r\nalmost every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd since Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly once ... until to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Did she come to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is here now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she came about ten minutes ago. Her carriage is standing in the\r\nPlace Saint-Ferdinand, as usual. I met her at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the occupant of the second floor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two: a modiste, Mademoiselle Langeais, and a gentleman who\r\nrented two furnished rooms a month ago under the name of Bresson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say \xe2\x80\x98under the name\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have an idea that it is an assumed name. My wife takes care\r\nof his rooms, and ... well, there are not two shirts there with the\r\nsame initials.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he there much of the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he is nearly always out. He has not been here for three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he here on Saturday night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday night?... Let me think.... Yes, Saturday night, he came in\r\nand stayed all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a man is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can scarcely answer that. He is so changeable. He is, by\r\nturns, big, little, fat, thin ... dark and light. I do not always\r\nrecognize him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard and Sholmes exchanged looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is he, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the concierge, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is the girl now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle had just emerged from the house and was walking toward her\r\ncarriage in the Place Saint-Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is Monsieur Bresson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Bresson? Which is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man with the parcel under his arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is not looking after the girl. She is going to her carriage\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have never seen them together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two detectives had arisen. By the light of the street-lamps they\r\nrecognized the form of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, who had started off in a direction\r\nopposite to that taken by the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich will you follow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will follow him, of course. He\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will follow the girl,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, quickly, who did not wish to disclose the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s identity to Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9cI know where to find her. Come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey followed Lupin at a safe distance, taking care to conceal\r\nthemselves as well as possible amongst the moving throng and behind the\r\nnewspaper kiosks. They found the pursuit an easy one, as he walked\r\nsteadily forward without turning to the right or left, but with a\r\nslight limp in the right leg, so slight as to require the keen eye of a\r\nprofessional observer to detect it. Ganimard observed it, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is pretending to be lame. Ah! if we could only collect two or three\r\npolicemen and pounce on our man! We run a chance to lose him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they did not meet any policemen before they reached the Porte des\r\nTernes, and, having passed the fortifications, there was no prospect of\r\nreceiving any assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had better separate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cas there are so few people on\r\nthe street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were now on the Boulevard Victor-Hugo. They walked one on each\r\nside of the street, and kept well in the shadow of the trees. They\r\ncontinued thus for twenty minutes, when Lupin turned to the left and\r\nfollowed the Seine. Very soon they saw him descend to the edge of the\r\nriver. He remained there only a few seconds, but they could not observe\r\nhis movements. Then Lupin retraced his steps. His pursuers concealed\r\nthemselves in the shadow of a gateway. Lupin passed in front of them.\r\nHis parcel had disappeared. And as he walked away another man emerged\r\nfrom the shelter of a house and glided amongst the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to be following him also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit continued, but was now embarrassed by the presence of the\r\nthird man. Lupin returned the same way, passed through the Porte des\r\nTernes, and re-entered the house in the avenue des Ternes.\r\n\r\nThe concierge was closing the house for the night when Ganimard\r\npresented himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the concierge, \xe2\x80\x9cI was putting out the gas on the landing\r\nwhen he closed and bolted his door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any person with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he has no servant. He never eats here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a servants\xe2\x80\x99 stairway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard said to Sholmes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had better stand at the door of his room while you go for the\r\ncommissary of police in the rue Demours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he should escape during that time?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I am here! He can\xe2\x80\x99t escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne to one, with Lupin, is not an even chance for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t force the door. I have no right to do that, especially\r\nat night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes shrugged his shoulders and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you arrest Lupin no one will question the methods by which you\r\nmade the arrest. However, let us go up and ring, and see what happens\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey ascended to the second floor. There was a double door at the left\r\nof the landing. Ganimard rang the bell. No reply. He rang again. Still\r\nno reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, come on,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ganimard.\r\n\r\nYet, they stood still, irresolute. Like people who hesitate when they\r\nought to accomplish a decisive action they feared to move, and it\r\nseemed to them impossible that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was there, so close to\r\nthem, on the other side of that fragile door that could be broken down\r\nby one blow of the fist. But they knew Lupin too well to suppose that\r\nhe would allow himself to be trapped in that stupid manner. No, no\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nthousand times, no\xe2\x80\x94Lupin was no longer there. Through the adjoining\r\nhouses, over the roofs, by some conveniently prepared exit, he must\r\nhave already made his escape, and, once more, it would only be Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshadow that they would seize.\r\n\r\nThey shuddered as a slight noise, coming from the other side of the\r\ndoor, reached their ears. Then they had the impression, amounting\r\nalmost to a certainty, that he was there, separated from them by that\r\nfrail wooden door, and that he was listening to them, that he could\r\nhear them.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? The situation was a serious one. In spite of their\r\nvast experience as detectives, they were so nervous and excited that\r\nthey thought they could hear the beating of their own hearts. Ganimard\r\nquestioned Sholmes by a look. Then he struck the door a violent blow\r\nwith his fist. Immediately they heard the sound of footsteps,\r\nconcerning which there was no attempt at concealment.\r\n\r\nGanimard shook the door. Then he and Sholmes, uniting their efforts,\r\nrushed at the door, and burst it open with their shoulders. Then they\r\nstood still, in surprise. A shot had been fired in the adjoining room.\r\nAnother shot, and the sound of a falling body.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered they saw the man lying on the floor with his face\r\ntoward the marble mantel. His revolver had fallen from his hand.\r\nGanimard stooped and turned the man\xe2\x80\x99s head. The face was covered with\r\nblood, which was flowing from two wounds, one in the cheek, the other\r\nin the temple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t recognize him for blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know? You haven\xe2\x80\x99t even looked at him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is the kind of a man that would kill\r\nhimself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sholmes, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we thought we recognized him outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought so, because the wish was father to the thought. That man\r\nhas us bewitched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it must be one of his accomplices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe accomplices of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin do not kill themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, who is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey searched the corpse. In one pocket Herlock Sholmes found an empty\r\npocketbook; in another Ganimard found several louis. There were no\r\nmarks of identification on any part of his clothing. In a trunk and two\r\nvalises they found nothing but wearing apparel. On the mantel there was\r\na pile of newspapers. Ganimard opened them. All of them contained\r\narticles referring to the theft of the Jewish lamp.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, when Ganimard and Sholmes left the house, they had\r\nacquired no further knowledge of the strange individual who had been\r\ndriven to suicide by their untimely visit.\r\n\r\nWho was he? Why had he killed himself? What was his connection with the\r\naffair of the Jewish lamp? Who had followed him on his return from the\r\nriver? The situation involved many complex questions\xe2\x80\x94many mysteries\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes went to bed in a very bad humor. Early next morning he\r\nreceived the following telephonic message:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin has the honor to inform you of his tragic death in the\r\nperson of Monsieur Bresson, and requests the honor of your presence at\r\nthe funeral service and burial, which will be held at the public\r\nexpense on Thursday, 25 June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE SHIPWRECK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I don\xe2\x80\x99t like, Wilson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herlock Sholmes, after he had\r\nread Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s message; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is what exasperates me in this\r\naffair\xe2\x80\x94to feel that the cunning, mocking eye of that fellow follows me\r\neverywhere. He sees everything; he knows everything; he reads my inmost\r\nthoughts; he even foresees my slightest movement. Ah! he is possessed\r\nof a marvellous intuition, far surpassing that of the most instinctive\r\nwoman, yes, surpassing even that of Herlock Sholmes himself. Nothing\r\nescapes him. I resemble an actor whose every step and movement are\r\ndirected by a stage-manager; who says this and does that in obedience\r\nto a superior will. That is my position. Do you understand, Wilson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCertainly Wilson would have understood if his faculties had not been\r\ndeadened by the profound slumber of a man whose temperature varies\r\nbetween one hundred and one hundred and three degrees. But whether he\r\nheard or not was a matter of no consequence to Herlock Sholmes, who\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to concentrate all my energy and bring all my resources into\r\naction in order to make the slightest progress. And, fortunately for\r\nme, those petty annoyances are like so many pricks from a needle and\r\nserve only to stimulate me. As soon as the heat of the wound is\r\nappeased and the shock to my vanity has subsided I say to myself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amuse yourself, my dear fellow, but remember that he who laughs last\r\nlaughs best. Sooner or later you will betray yourself.\xe2\x80\x99 For you know,\r\nWilson, it was Lupin himself, who, by his first dispatch and the\r\nobservation that it suggested to little Henriette, disclosed to me the\r\nsecret of his correspondence with Alice Hemun. Have you forgotten that\r\ncircumstance, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Wilson was asleep; and Sholmes, pacing to and fro, resumed his\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, now, things are not in a bad shape; a little obscure, perhaps,\r\nbut the light is creeping in. In the first place, I must learn all\r\nabout Monsieur Bresson. Ganimard and I will visit the bank of the\r\nriver, at the spot where Bresson threw away the package, and the\r\nparticular r\xc3\xb4le of that gentleman will be known to me. After that the\r\ngame will be played between me and Alice Demun. Rather a light-weight\r\nopponent, hein, Wilson? And do you not think that I will soon know the\r\nphrase represented by the letters clipped from the alphabet-book, and\r\nwhat the isolated letters\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x98C\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98H\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94mean? That is all I want\r\nto know, Wilson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle entered at that moment, and, observing Sholmes\r\ngesticulating, she said, in her sweetest manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Sholmes, I must scold you if you waken my patient. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnice of you to disturb him. The doctor has ordered absolute rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in silence, astonished, as on their first meeting, at\r\nher wonderful self-possession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you look at me so, Monsieur Sholmes?... You seem to be trying\r\nto read my thoughts.... No?... Then what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe questioned him with the most innocent expression on her pretty face\r\nand in her frank blue eyes. A smile played upon her lips; and she\r\ndisplayed so much unaffected candor that the Englishman almost lost his\r\ntemper. He approached her and said, in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBresson killed himself last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe affected not to understand him; so he repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBresson killed himself yesterday....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not show the slightest emotion; she acted as if the matter did\r\nnot concern or interest her in any way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been informed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, displaying his annoyance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise, the news would have caused you to start, at least. Ah! you\r\nare stronger than I expected. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of your trying to\r\nconceal anything from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe picked up the alphabet-book, which he had placed on a convenient\r\ntable, and, opening it at the mutilated page, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me the order in which the missing letters should be\r\narranged in order to express the exact wording of the message you sent\r\nto Bresson four days before the theft of the Jewish lamp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe order?... Bresson?... the theft of the Jewish lamp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe repeated the words slowly, as if trying to grasp their meaning. He\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Here are the letters employed ... on this bit of paper.... What\r\ndid you say to Bresson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters employed ... what did I say....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly she burst into laughter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is it! I understand! I am an accomplice in the crime! There\r\nis a Monsieur Bresson who stole the Jewish lamp and who has now\r\ncommitted suicide. And I am the friend of that gentleman. Oh! how\r\nabsurd you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom did you go to see last night on the second floor of a house in\r\nthe avenue des Ternes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? My modiste, Mademoiselle Langeais. Do you suppose that my modiste\r\nand my friend Monsieur Bresson are the same person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDespite all he knew, Sholmes was now in doubt. A person can feign\r\nterror, joy, anxiety, in fact all emotions; but a person cannot feign\r\nabsolute indifference or light, careless laughter. Yet he continued to\r\nquestion her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you accost me the other evening at the Northern Railway\r\nstation? And why did you entreat me to leave Paris immediately without\r\ninvestigating this theft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you are too inquisitive, Monsieur Sholmes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, still\r\nlaughing in the most natural manner. \xe2\x80\x9cTo punish you I will tell you\r\nnothing, and, besides, you must watch the patient while I go to the\r\npharmacy on an urgent message. Au revoir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am beaten ... by a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cNot only did I get\r\nnothing out of her but I exposed my hand and put her on her guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he recalled the affair of the blue diamond and his first interview\r\nwith Clotilde Destange. Had not the blonde Lady met his question with\r\nthe same unruffled serenity, and was he not once more face to face with\r\none of those creatures who, under the protection and influence of\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, maintain the utmost coolness in the face of a terrible\r\ndanger?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSholmes ... Sholmes....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Wilson who called him. Sholmes approached the bed, and, leaning\r\nover, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Wilson? Does your wound pain you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilson\xe2\x80\x99s lips moved, but he could not speak. At last, with a great\r\neffort, he stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ... Sholmes ... it is not she ... that is impossible\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Wilson, what do you know about it? I tell you that it is she! It\r\nis only when I meet one of Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s creatures, prepared and instructed\r\nby him, that I lose my head and make a fool of myself.... I bet you\r\nthat within an hour Lupin will know all about our interview. Within an\r\nhour? What am I saying?... Why, he may know already. The visit to the\r\npharmacy ... urgent message. All nonsense!... She has gone to telephone\r\nto Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes left the house hurriedly, went down the avenue de Messine, and\r\nwas just in time to see Mademoiselle enter a pharmacy. Ten minutes\r\nlater she emerged from the shop carrying some small packages and a\r\nbottle wrapped in white paper. But she had not proceeded far, when she\r\nwas accosted by a man who, with hat in hand and an obsequious air,\r\nappeared to be asking for charity. She stopped, gave him something, and\r\nproceeded on her way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe spoke to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman to himself.\r\n\r\nIf not a certainty, it was at least an intuition, and quite sufficient\r\nto cause him to change his tactics. Leaving the girl to pursue her own\r\ncourse, he followed the suspected mendicant, who walked slowly to the\r\navenue des Ternes and lingered for a long time around the house in\r\nwhich Bresson had lived, sometimes raising his eyes to the windows of\r\nthe second floor and watching the people who entered the house.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour he climbed to the top of a tramcar going in the\r\ndirection of Neuilly. Sholmes followed and took a seat behind the man,\r\nand beside a gentleman who was concealed behind the pages of a\r\nnewspaper. At the fortifications the gentleman lowered the paper, and\r\nSholmes recognized Ganimard, who thereupon whispered, as he pointed to\r\nthe man in front:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the man who followed Bresson last night. He has been watching\r\nthe house for an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything new in regard to Bresson?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a letter came to his address this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning? Then it was posted yesterday before the sender could\r\nknow of Bresson\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. It is now in the possession of the examining magistrate. But\r\nI read it. It says: _He will not accept any compromise. He wants\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x94the first thing as well as those of the second affair.\r\nOtherwise he will proceed._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no signature,\xe2\x80\x9d added Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me those few\r\nlines won\xe2\x80\x99t help us much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you, Monsieur Ganimard. To me those few lines are\r\nvery interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so? I can\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor reasons that are personal to me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sholmes, with the\r\nindifference that he frequently displayed toward his colleague.\r\n\r\nThe tramcar stopped at the rue de Ch\xc3\xa2teau, which was the terminus. The\r\nman descended and walked away quietly. Sholmes followed at so short a\r\ndistance that Ganimard protested, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he should turn around he will suspect us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not turn around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an accomplice of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, and the fact that he walks in\r\nthat manner, with his hands in his pockets, proves, in the first place,\r\nthat he knows he is being followed and, in the second place, that he is\r\nnot afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think we are keeping too close to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot too close to prevent his slipping through our fingers. He is too\r\nsure of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Look there! In front of that caf\xc3\xa9 there are two of the bicycle\r\npolice. If I summon them to our assistance, how can the man slip\r\nthrough our fingers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, our friend doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be worried about it. In fact, he is\r\nasking for their assistance himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9che has a nerve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man approached the two policemen just as they were mounting their\r\nbicycles. After a few words with them he leaped on a third bicycle,\r\nwhich was leaning against the wall of the caf\xc3\xa9, and rode away at a fast\r\npace, accompanied by the two policemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHein! one, two, three and away!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd through whose\r\nagency, Monsieur Ganimard? Two of your colleagues.... Ah! but Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin has a wonderful organization! Bicycle policemen in his\r\nservice!... I told you our man was too calm, too sure of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard, quite vexed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are we to do now? It is\r\neasy enough to laugh! Anyone can do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, don\xe2\x80\x99t lose your temper! We will get our revenge. But, in\r\nthe meantime, we need reinforcements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolenfant is waiting for me at the end of the avenue de Neuilly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go and get him and join me later. I will follow our fugitive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes followed the bicycle tracks, which were plainly visible in the\r\ndust of the road as two of the machines were furnished with striated\r\ntires. Very soon he ascertained that the tracks were leading him to the\r\nedge of the Seine, and that the three men had turned in the direction\r\ntaken by Bresson on the preceding evening. Thus he arrived at the\r\ngateway where he and Ganimard had concealed themselves, and, a little\r\nfarther on, he discovered a mingling of the bicycle tracks which showed\r\nthat the men had halted at that spot. Directly opposite there was a\r\nlittle point of land which projected into the river and, at the\r\nextremity thereof, an old boat was moored.\r\n\r\nIt was there that Bresson had thrown away the package, or, rather, had\r\ndropped it. Sholmes descended the bank and saw that the declivity was\r\nnot steep and the water quite shallow, so it would be quite easy to\r\nrecover the package, provided the three men had not forestalled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that can\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthey have not had time. A quarter of\r\nan hour at the most. And yet, why did they come this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fisherman was seated on the old boat. Sholmes asked him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see three men on bicycles a few minutes ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fisherman made a negative gesture. But Sholmes insisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree men who stopped on the road just on top of the bank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fisherman rested his pole under his arm, took a memorandum book\r\nfrom his pocket, wrote on one of the pages, tore it out, and handed it\r\nto Sholmes. The Englishman gave a start of surprise. In the middle of\r\nthe paper which he held in his hand he saw the series of letters cut\r\nfrom the alphabet-book:\r\n\r\nCDEHNOPRZEO\xe2\x80\x94237.\r\n\r\nThe man resumed his fishing, sheltered from the sun by a large straw\r\nhat, with his coat and vest lying beside him. He was intently watching\r\nthe cork attached to his line as it floated on the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence\xe2\x80\x94solemn and terrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it he?\xe2\x80\x9d conjectured Sholmes, with an anxiety that was almost\r\npitiful. Then the truth burst upon him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is he! It is he! No one else could remain there so calmly, without\r\nthe slightest display of anxiety, without the least fear of what might\r\nhappen. And who else would know the story of those mysterious letters?\r\nAlice had warned him by means of her messenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Englishman felt that his hand\xe2\x80\x94that his own hand had\r\ninvoluntarily seized the handle of his revolver, and that his eyes were\r\nfixed on the man\xe2\x80\x99s back, a little below the neck. One movement, and the\r\ndrama would be finished; the life of the strange adventurer would come\r\nto a miserable end.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman did not stir.\r\n\r\nSholmes nervously toyed with his revolver, and experienced a wild\r\ndesire to fire it and end everything; but the horror of such an act was\r\nrepugnant to his nature. Death would be certain and would end all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9clet him get up and defend himself. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, so\r\nmuch the worse for him. One second more ... and I fire....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut a sound of footsteps behind him caused him to turn his head. It was\r\nGanimard coming with some assistants.\r\n\r\nThen, quickly changing his plans, Sholmes leaped into the boat, which\r\nwas broken from its moorings by his sudden action; he pounced upon the\r\nman and seized him around the body. They rolled to the bottom of the\r\nboat together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lupin, struggling to free himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does\r\nthis mean? When one of us has conquered the other, what good will it\r\ndo? You will not know what to do with me, nor I with you. We will\r\nremain here like two idiots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two oars slipped into the water. The boat drifted into the stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, what a fuss you make! A man of your age ought to know\r\nbetter! You act like a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin succeeded in freeing himself from the grasp of the detective,\r\nwho, thoroughly exasperated and ready to kill, put his hand in his\r\npocket. He uttered an oath: Lupin had taken his revolver. Then he knelt\r\ndown and tried to capture one of the lost oars in order to regain the\r\nshore, while Lupin was trying to capture the other oar in order to\r\ndrive the boat down the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gone! I can\xe2\x80\x99t reach it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence.\r\nIf you get your oar I can prevent your using it. And you could do the\r\nsame to me. But, you see, that is the way in this world, we act without\r\nany purpose or reason, as our efforts are in vain since Fate decides\r\neverything. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Fate is on the side of his friend\r\nLupin. The game is mine! The current favors me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat was slowly drifting down the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lupin, quickly.\r\n\r\nSomeone on the bank was pointing a revolver. Lupin stooped, a shot was\r\nfired; it struck the water beyond the boat. Lupin burst into laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless me! It\xe2\x80\x99s my friend Ganimard! But it was very wrong of you to\r\ndo that, Ganimard. You have no right to shoot except in self-defense.\r\nDoes poor Lupin worry you so much that you forget yourself?... Now, be\r\ngood, and don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot again!... If you do you will hit our English\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood behind Sholmes, facing Ganimard, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Ganimard, I am ready! Aim for his heart!... Higher!... A little\r\nto the left.... Ah! you missed that time ... deuced bad shot.... Try\r\nagain.... Your hand shakes, Ganimard.... Now, once more ... one, two,\r\nthree, fire!... Missed!... Parbleu! the authorities furnish you with\r\ntoy-pistols.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin drew a long revolver and fired without taking aim. Ganimard put\r\nhis hand to his hat: the bullet had passed through it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of that, Ganimard! Ah! that\xe2\x80\x99s a real revolver! A\r\ngenuine English bulldog. It belongs to my friend, Herlock Sholmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, with a laugh, he threw the revolver to the shore, where it landed\r\nat Ganimard\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\nSholmes could not withhold a smile of admiration. What a torrent of\r\nyouthful spirits! And how he seemed to enjoy himself! It appeared as if\r\nthe sensation of peril caused him a physical pleasure; and this\r\nextraordinary man had no other purpose in life than to seek for dangers\r\nsimply for the amusement it afforded him in avoiding them.\r\n\r\nMany people had now gathered on the banks of the river, and Ganimard\r\nand his men followed the boat as it slowly floated down the stream.\r\nLupin\xe2\x80\x99s capture was a mathematical certainty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfess, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, turning to the Englishman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nwould not exchange your present position for all the gold in the\r\nTransvaal! You are now in the first row of the orchestra chairs! But,\r\nin the first place, we must have the prologue ... after which we can\r\nleap, at one bound, to the fifth act of the drama, which will represent\r\nthe capture or escape of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. Therefore, I am going to ask you\r\na plain question, to which I request a plain answer\xe2\x80\x94a simple yes or no.\r\nWill you renounce this affair? At present I can repair the damage you\r\nhave done; later it will be beyond my power. Is it a bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin\xe2\x80\x99s face showed his disappointment and annoyance. He continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI insist. More for your sake than my own, I insist, because I am\r\ncertain you will be the first to regret your intervention. For the last\r\ntime, yes or no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLupin stooped down, removed one of the boards in the bottom of the\r\nboat, and, for some minutes, was engaged in a work the nature of which\r\nSholmes could not discern. Then he arose, seated himself beside the\r\nEnglishman, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe, monsieur, that we came to the river to-day for the same\r\npurpose: to recover the object which Bresson threw away. For my part I\r\nhad invited a few friends to join me here, and I was on the point of\r\nmaking an examination of the bed of the river when my friends announced\r\nyour approach. I confess that the news did not surprise me, as I have\r\nbeen notified every hour concerning the progress of your investigation.\r\nThat was an easy matter. Whenever anything occurred in the rue Murillo\r\nthat might interest me, simply a ring on the telephone and I was\r\ninformed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped. The board that he had displaced in the bottom of the boat\r\nwas rising and water was working into the boat all around it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to fix it. I was afraid this old boat\r\nwould leak. You are not afraid, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes shrugged his shoulders. Lupin continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand then, in those circumstances, and knowing in\r\nadvance that you would be more eager to seek a battle than I would be\r\nto avoid it, I assure you I was not entirely displeased to enter into a\r\ncontest of which the issue is quite certain, since I hold all the trump\r\ncards in my hand. And I desired that our meeting should be given the\r\nwidest publicity in order that your defeat may be universally known, so\r\nthat another Countess de Crozon or another Baron d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle may not\r\nbe tempted to solicit your aid against me. Besides, my dear monsieur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped again and, using his half-closed hands as a lorgnette, he\r\nscanned the banks of the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu! they have chartered a superb boat, a real war-vessel, and\r\nsee how they are rowing. In five minutes they will be along-side, and I\r\nam lost. Monsieur Sholmes, a word of advice; you seize me, bind me and\r\ndeliver me to the officers of the law. Does that programme please\r\nyou?... Unless, in the meantime, we are shipwrecked, in which event we\r\ncan do nothing but prepare our wills. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey exchanged looks. Sholmes now understood Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s scheme: he had\r\nscuttled the boat. And the water was rising. It had reached the soles\r\nof their boots. Then it covered their feet; but they did not move. It\r\nwas half-way to their knees. The Englishman took out his tobacco,\r\nrolled a cigarette, and lighted it. Lupin continued to talk:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do not regard that offer as a confession of my weakness. I\r\nsurrender to you in a battle in which I can achieve a victory in order\r\nto avoid a struggle upon a field not of my own choosing. In so doing I\r\nrecognize the fact that Sholmes is the only enemy I fear, and announce\r\nmy anxiety that Sholmes will not be diverted from my track. I take this\r\nopportunity to tell you these things since fate has accorded me the\r\nhonor of a conversation with you. I have only one regret; it is that\r\nour conversation should have occurred while we are taking a foot-bath\r\n... a situation that is lacking in dignity, I must confess.... What did\r\nI say? A foot-bath? It is worse than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe water had reached the board on which they were sitting, and the\r\nboat was gradually sinking.\r\n\r\nSholmes, smoking his cigarette, appeared to be calmly admiring the\r\nscenery. For nothing in the world, while face to face with that man\r\nwho, while threatened by dangers, surrounded by a crowd, followed by a\r\nposse of police, maintained his equanimity and good humor, for nothing\r\nin the world would he, Sholmes, display the slightest sign of\r\nnervousness.\r\n\r\nEach of them looked as if he might say: Should a person be disturbed by\r\nsuch trifles? Are not people drowned in a river every day? Is it such\r\nan unusual event as to deserve special attention? One chatted, whilst\r\nthe other dreamed; both concealing their wounded pride beneath a mask\r\nof indifference.\r\n\r\nOne minute more and the boat will sink. Lupin continued his chatter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe important thing to know is whether we will sink before or after\r\nthe arrival of the champions of the law. That is the main question. As\r\nto our shipwreck, that is a foregone conclusion. Now, monsieur, the\r\nhour has come in which we must make our wills. I give, devise and\r\nbequeath all my property to Herlock Sholmes, a citizen of England, for\r\nhis own use and benefit. But, mon Dieu, how quickly the champions of\r\nthe law are approaching! Ah! the brave fellows! It is a pleasure to\r\nwatch them. Observe the precision of the oars! Ah! is it you, Brigadier\r\nFolenfant? Bravo! The idea of a war-vessel is an excellent one. I\r\ncommend you to your superiors, Brigadier Folenfant.... Do you wish a\r\nmedal? You shall have it. And your comrade Dieuzy, where is he?... Ah!\r\nyes, I think I see him on the left bank of the river at the head of a\r\nhundred natives. So that, if I escape shipwreck, I shall be captured on\r\nthe left by Dieuzy and his natives, or, on the right, by Ganimard and\r\nthe populace of Neuilly. An embarrassing dilemma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat entered an eddy; it swung around and Sholmes caught hold of\r\nthe oarlocks. Lupin said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, you should remove your coat. You will find it easier to swim\r\nwithout a coat. No? You refuse? Then I shall put on my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe donned his coat, buttoned it closely, the same as Sholmes, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a discourteous man you are! And what a pity that you should be so\r\nstubborn in this affair, in which, of course, you display your\r\nstrength, but, oh! so vainly! really, you mar your genius\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Lupin,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Sholmes, emerging from his silence, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ntalk too much, and you frequently err through excess of confidence and\r\nthrough your frivolity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a severe reproach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus, without knowing it, you furnished me, only a moment ago, with\r\nthe information I required.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you required some information and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no occasion to ask you for it\xe2\x80\x94you volunteered it. Within three\r\nhours I can deliver the key of the mystery to Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle.\r\nThat is the only reply\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence. The boat suddenly sank, taking both of\r\nthe men down with it. It emerged immediately, with its keel in the air.\r\nShouts were heard on either bank, succeeded by an anxious moment of\r\nsilence. Then the shouts were renewed: one of the shipwrecked party had\r\ncome to the surface.\r\n\r\nIt was Herlock Sholmes. He was an excellent swimmer, and struck out,\r\nwith powerful strokes, for Folenfant\xe2\x80\x99s boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage, Monsieur Sholmes,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Folenfant; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are here. Keep it\r\nup ... we will get you ... a little more, Monsieur Sholmes ... catch\r\nthe rope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman seized the rope they had thrown to him. But, while they\r\nwere hauling him into the boat, he heard a voice behind him, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe key of the mystery, monsieur, yes, you shall have it. I am\r\nastonished that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it already. What then? What good will\r\nit do you? By that time you will have lost the battle....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow comfortably installed astride the keel of the boat, Lupin continued\r\nhis speech with solemn gestures, as if he hoped to convince his\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must understand, my dear Sholmes, there is nothing to be done,\r\nabsolutely nothing. You find yourself in the deplorable position of a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurrender, Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Folenfant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an ill-bred fellow, Folenfant, to interrupt me in the middle\r\nof a sentence. I was saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurrender, Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! parbleu! Brigadier Folenfant, a man surrenders only when he is in\r\ndanger. Surely, you do not pretend to say that I am in any danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last time, Lupin, I call on you to surrender.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrigadier Folenfant, you have no intention of killing me; you may wish\r\nto wound me since you are afraid I may escape. But if by chance the\r\nwound prove mortal? Just think of your remorse! It would embitter your\r\nold age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shot was fired.\r\n\r\nLupin staggered, clutched at the keel of the boat for a moment, then\r\nlet go and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was exactly three o\xe2\x80\x99clock when the foregoing events transpired.\r\nPrecisely at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as he had foretold, Herlock Sholmes, dressed\r\nin trousers that were too short and a coat that was too small, which he\r\nhad borrowed from an innkeeper at Neuilly, wearing a cap and a flannel\r\nshirt, entered the boudoir in the Rue Murillo, after having sent word\r\nto Monsieur and Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle that he desired an interview.\r\n\r\nThey found him walking up and down the room. And he looked so ludicrous\r\nin his strange costume that they could scarcely suppress their mirth.\r\nWith pensive air and stooped shoulders, he walked like an automaton\r\nfrom the window to the door and from the door to the window, taking\r\neach time the same number of steps, and turning each time in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, picked up a small ornament, examined it mechanically, and\r\nresumed his walk. At last, planting himself before them, he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mademoiselle here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is in the garden with the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Mademoiselle to be present at this interview.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it necessary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a little patience, monsieur. From the facts I am going to present\r\nto you, you will see the necessity for her presence here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Suzanne, will you call her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle arose, went out, and returned almost immediately,\r\naccompanied by Alice Demun. Mademoiselle, who was a trifle paler than\r\nusual, remained standing, leaning against a table, and without even\r\nasking why she had been called. Sholmes did not look at her, but,\r\nsuddenly turning toward Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle, he said, in a tone which\r\ndid not admit of a reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter several days\xe2\x80\x99 investigation, monsieur, I must repeat what I told\r\nyou when I first came here: the Jewish lamp was stolen by some one\r\nliving in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name of the guilty party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour proof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have sufficient to establish that fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we require more than that. We desire the restoration of the stolen\r\ngoods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Jewish lamp? It is in my possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe opal necklace? The snuff-box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe opal necklace, the snuff-box, and all the goods stolen on the\r\nsecond occasion are in my possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes delighted in these dramatic dialogues, and it pleased him to\r\nannounce his victories in that curt manner. The baron and his wife were\r\namazed, and looked at Sholmes with a silent curiosity, which was the\r\nhighest praise.\r\n\r\nHe related to them, very minutely, what he had done during those three\r\ndays. He told of his discovery of the alphabet book, wrote upon a sheet\r\nof paper the sentence formed by the missing letters, then related the\r\njourney of Bresson to the bank of the river and the suicide of the\r\nadventurer, and, finally, his struggle with Lupin, the shipwreck, and\r\nthe disappearance of Lupin. When he had finished, the baron said, in a\r\nlow voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you have told us everything except the name of the guilty party.\r\nWhom do you accuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accuse the person who cut the letters from the alphabet book, and\r\ncommunicated with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin by means of those letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that such correspondence was carried on with Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy information comes from Lupin himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe produced a piece of paper that was wet and crumpled. It was the page\r\nwhich Lupin had torn from his memorandum-book, and upon which he had\r\nwritten the phrase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will notice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, with satisfaction, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he was\r\nnot obliged to give me that sheet of paper, and, in that way, disclose\r\nhis identity. Simple childishness on his part, and yet it gave me\r\nexactly the information I desired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the baron. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes took a pencil and made a fresh copy of the letters and figures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCDEHNOPRZEO\xe2\x80\x94237.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron; \xe2\x80\x9cit is the formula you showed me yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. If you had turned and returned that formula in every way, as I\r\nhave done, you would have seen at first glance that this formula is not\r\nlike the first one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what respect do they differ?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one has two more letters\xe2\x80\x94an E and an O.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally; I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoin those two letters to the C and the H which remained after forming\r\nthe word \xe2\x80\x98respondez,\xe2\x80\x99 and you will agree with me that the only possible\r\nword is ECHO.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt refers to the _Echo de France_, Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper, his official\r\norgan, the one in which he publishes his communications. Reply in the\r\n_Echo de France_, in the personal advertisements, under number 237.\r\nThat is the key to the mystery, and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was kind enough to\r\nfurnish it to me. I went to the newspaper office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you find there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found the entire story of the relations between Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and his\r\naccomplice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes produced seven newspapers which he opened at the fourth page\r\nand pointed to the following lines:\r\n\r\n1. Ars. Lup. Lady implores protection. 540.\r\n\r\n2. 540. Awaiting particulars. A.L.\r\n\r\n3. A.L. Under domin. enemy. Lost.\r\n\r\n4. 540. Write address. Will make investigation.\r\n\r\n5. A.L. Murillo.\r\n\r\n6. 540. Park three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Violets.\r\n\r\n7. 237. Understand. Sat. Will be Sun. morn. park.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you call that the whole story!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the baron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and if you will listen to me for a few minutes, I think I can\r\nconvince you. In the first place, a lady who signs herself 540 implores\r\nthe protection of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, who replies by asking for particulars.\r\nThe lady replies that she is under the domination of an enemy\xe2\x80\x94who is\r\nBresson, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94and that she is lost if some one does not come to her\r\nassistance. Lupin is suspicious and does not yet venture to appoint an\r\ninterview with the unknown woman, demands the address and proposes to\r\nmake an investigation. The lady hesitates for four days\xe2\x80\x94look at the\r\ndates\xe2\x80\x94finally, under stress of circumstances and influenced by\r\nBresson\xe2\x80\x99s threats, she gives the name of the street\xe2\x80\x94Murillo. Next day,\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin announces that he will be in the Park Monceau at three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and asks his unknown correspondent to wear a bouquet of\r\nviolets as a means of identification. Then there is a lapse of eight\r\ndays in the correspondence. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and the lady do not require to\r\ncorrespond through the newspaper now, as they see each other or write\r\ndirectly. The scheme is arranged in this way: in order to satisfy\r\nBresson\xe2\x80\x99s demands, the lady is to carry off the Jewish lamp. The date\r\nis not yet fixed. The lady who, as a matter of prudence, corresponds by\r\nmeans of letters cut out of a book, decides on Saturday and adds:\r\n_Reply Echo 237_. Lupin replies that it is understood and that he will\r\nbe in the park on Sunday morning. Sunday morning, the theft takes\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, that is an excellent chain of circumstantial evidence and\r\nevery link is complete,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe theft has taken place,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sholmes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lady goes out on\r\nSunday morning, tells Lupin what she has done, and carries the Jewish\r\nlamp to Bresson. Everything occurs then exactly as Lupin had foreseen.\r\nThe officers of the law, deceived by an open window, four holes in the\r\nground and two scratches on the balcony railing, immediately advance\r\nthe theory that the theft was committed by a burglar. The lady is\r\nsafe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I confess the theory was a logical one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the\r\nsecond theft\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second theft was provoked by the first. The newspapers having\r\nrelated how the Jewish lamp had disappeared, some one conceived the\r\nidea of repeating the crime and carrying away what had been left. This\r\ntime, it was not a simulated theft, but a real one, a genuine burglary,\r\nwith ladders and other paraphernalia\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLupin, of course\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Lupin does not act so stupidly. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fire at people for\r\ntrifling reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, who was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBresson, no doubt, and unknown to the lady whom he had menaced. It was\r\nBresson who entered here; it was Bresson that I pursued; it was Bresson\r\nwho wounded poor Wilson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely. One of Bresson\xe2\x80\x99s accomplices wrote to him yesterday,\r\nbefore his suicide, a letter which proves that negotiations were\r\npending between this accomplice and Lupin for the restitution of all\r\nthe articles stolen from your house. Lupin demanded everything, \xe2\x80\x98_the\r\nfirst thing_ (that is, the Jewish lamp) _as well as those of the second\r\naffair_.\xe2\x80\x99 Moreover, he was watching Bresson. When the latter returned\r\nfrom the river last night, one of Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s men followed him as well as\r\nwe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was Bresson doing at the river?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving been warned of the progress of my investigations\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarned! by whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the same lady, who justly feared that the discovery of the Jewish\r\nlamp would lead to the discovery of her own adventure. Thereupon,\r\nBresson, having been warned, made into a package all the things that\r\ncould compromise him and threw them into a place where he thought he\r\ncould get them again when the danger was past. It was after his return,\r\ntracked by Ganimard and myself, having, no doubt, other sins on his\r\nconscience, that he lost his head and killed himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did the package contain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Jewish lamp and your other ornaments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, they are not in your possession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmediately after Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, I profited by the bath he had\r\nforced upon me, went to the spot selected by Bresson, where I found the\r\nstolen articles wrapped in some soiled linen. They are there, on the\r\ntable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a word, the baron cut the cord, tore open the wet linen, picked\r\nout the lamp, turned a screw in the foot, then divided the bowl of the\r\nlamp which opened in two equal parts and there he found the golden\r\nchimera, set with rubies and emeralds.\r\n\r\nIt was intact.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was in that scene, so natural in appearance and which consisted\r\nof a simple exposition of facts, something which rendered it\r\nfrightfully tragic\xe2\x80\x94it was the formal, direct, irrefutable accusation\r\nthat Sholmes launched in each of his words against Mademoiselle. And it\r\nwas also the impressive silence of Alice Demun.\r\n\r\nDuring that long, cruel accumulation of accusing circumstances heaped\r\none upon another, not a muscle of her face had moved, not a trace of\r\nrevolt or fear had marred the serenity of her limpid eyes. What were\r\nher thoughts. And, especially, what was she going to say at the solemn\r\nmoment when it would become necessary for her to speak and defend\r\nherself in order to break the chain of evidence that Herlock Sholmes\r\nhad so cleverly woven around her?\r\n\r\nThat moment had come, but the girl was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak! Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mon. d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle.\r\n\r\nShe did not speak. So he insisted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word will clear you. One word of denial, and I will believe you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat word, she would not utter.\r\n\r\nThe baron paced to and fro in his excitement; then, addressing Sholmes,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, I cannot believe it, I do not believe it. There are\r\nimpossible crimes! and this is opposed to all I know and to all that I\r\nhave seen during the past year. No, I cannot believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe placed his hand on the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you yourself, monsieur, are you absolutely certain that you are\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes hesitated, like a man on whom a sudden demand is made and\r\ncannot frame an immediate reply. Then he smiled, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the person whom I accuse, by reason of her situation in your\r\nhouse, could know that the Jewish lamp contained that magnificent\r\njewel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the baron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, really, the very thing he would not have done, blinded by the\r\nconfidence the girl had inspired in him. But he could no longer refrain\r\nfrom doing it. He approached her and, looking into her eyes, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it you, mademoiselle? Was it you who took the jewel? Was it you\r\nwho corresponded with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and committed the theft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was I, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nShe did not drop her head. Her face displayed no sign of shame or fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mon. d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle. \xe2\x80\x9cI would never have\r\nbelieved it.... You are the last person in the world that I would have\r\nsuspected. How did you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it exactly as Monsieur Sholmes has told it. On Saturday night I\r\ncame to the boudoir, took the lamp, and, in the morning I carried it\r\n... to that man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you pretend to have done is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible\xe2\x80\x94why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, in the morning I found the door of the boudoir bolted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe blushed, and looked at Sholmes as if seeking his counsel. Sholmes\r\nwas astonished at her embarrassment. Had she nothing to say? Did the\r\nconfessions, which had corroborated the report that he, Sholmes, had\r\nmade concerning the theft of the Jewish lamp, merely serve to mask a\r\nlie? Was she misleading them by a false confession?\r\n\r\nThe baron continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat door was locked. I found the door exactly as I had left it the\r\nnight before. If you entered by that door, as you pretend, some one\r\nmust have opened it from the interior\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, from the boudoir\r\nor from our chamber. Now, there was no one inside these two rooms ...\r\nthere was no one except my wife and myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSholmes bowed his head and covered his face with his hands in order to\r\nconceal his emotion. A sudden light had entered his mind, that startled\r\nhim and made him exceedingly uncomfortable. Everything was revealed to\r\nhim, like the sudden lifting of a fog from the morning landscape. He\r\nwas annoyed as well as ashamed, because his deductions were fallacious\r\nand his entire theory was wrong.\r\n\r\nAlice Demun was innocent!\r\n\r\nAlice Demun was innocent. That proposition explained the embarrassment\r\nhe had experienced from the beginning in directing the terrible\r\naccusation against that young girl. Now, he saw the truth; he knew it.\r\nAfter a few seconds, he raised his head, and looked at Madame\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle as naturally as he could. She was pale\xe2\x80\x94with that unusual\r\npallor which invades us in the relentless moments of our lives. Her\r\nhands, which she endeavored to conceal, were trembling as if stricken\r\nwith palsy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne minute more,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cand she will betray herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe placed himself between her and her husband in the desire to avert\r\nthe awful danger which, _through his fault_, now threatened that man\r\nand woman. But, at sight of the baron, he was shocked to the very\r\ncentre of his soul. The same dreadful idea had entered the mind of\r\nMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle. The same thought was at work in the brain of the\r\nhusband. He understood, also! He saw the truth!\r\n\r\nIn desperation, Alice Demun hurled herself against the implacable\r\ntruth, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, monsieur. I made a mistake. I did not enter by this\r\ndoor. I came through the garden and the vestibule ... by aid of a\r\nladder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a supreme effort of true devotion. But a useless effort! The\r\nwords rang false. The voice did not carry conviction, and the poor girl\r\nno longer displayed those clear, fearless eyes and that natural air of\r\ninnocence which had served her so well. Now, she bowed her\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94vanquished.\r\n\r\nThe silence became painful. Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle was waiting for her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s next move, overwhelmed with anxiety and fear. The baron\r\nappeared to be struggling against the dreadful suspicion, as if he\r\nwould not submit to the overthrow of his happiness. Finally, he said to\r\nhis wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak! Explain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, in a very low voice, and\r\nwith features drawn by anguish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, then ... Mademoiselle....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle saved me ... through devotion ... through affection ...\r\nand accused herself....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaved you from what? From whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom that man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBresson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it was I whom he held in fear by threats.... I met him at one of\r\nmy friends\xe2\x80\x99.... and I was foolish enough to listen to him. Oh! there\r\nwas nothing that you cannot pardon. But I wrote him two letters ...\r\nletters which you will see.... I had to buy them back ... you know\r\nhow.... Oh! have pity on me?... I have suffered so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! You! Suzanne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his clenched fists, ready to strike her, ready to kill her.\r\nBut he dropped his arms, and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Suzanne.... You!... Is it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy short detached sentences, she related the heartrending story, her\r\ndreadful awakening to the infamy of the man, her remorse, her fear, and\r\nshe also told of Alice\xe2\x80\x99s devotion; how the young girl divined the\r\nsorrow of her mistress, wormed a confession out of her, wrote to Lupin,\r\nand devised the scheme of the theft in order to save her from Bresson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Suzanne, you,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle, bowed with grief\r\nand shame.... \xe2\x80\x9cHow could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same evening, the steamer \xe2\x80\x9cCity of London,\xe2\x80\x9d which plies between\r\nCalais and Dover, was gliding slowly over the smooth sea. The night was\r\ndark; the wind was fainter than a zephyr. The majority of the\r\npassengers had retired to their cabins; but a few, more intrepid, were\r\npromenading on the deck or sleeping in large rocking-chairs, wrapped in\r\ntheir travelling-rugs. One could see, here and there, the light of a\r\ncigar, and one could hear, mingled with the soft murmur of the breeze,\r\nthe faint sound of voices which were carefully subdued to harmonize\r\nwith the deep silence of the night.\r\n\r\nOne of the passengers, who had been pacing to and fro upon the deck,\r\nstopped before a woman who was lying on a bench, scrutinized her, and,\r\nwhen she moved a little, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were asleep, Mademoiselle Alice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Monsieur Sholmes, I am not sleepy. I was thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what? If I may be so bold as to inquire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle. She must be very unhappy. Her\r\nlife is ruined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cHer mistake was not a serious one.\r\nMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle will forgive and forget it. Why, even before we\r\nleft, his manner toward her had softened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps ... but he will remember it for a long time ... and she will\r\nsuffer a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much. It was my love for her that gave me strength to smile when\r\nI was trembling from fear, that gave me courage to look in your face\r\nwhen I desired to hide from your sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are sorry to leave her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very sorry. I have no relatives, no friends\xe2\x80\x94but her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman, who was affected by her\r\nsorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cI have promised that. I have relatives ... and some influence.\r\nI assure you that you will have no cause to regret coming to England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be, monsieur, but Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle will not be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerlock Sholmes resumed his promenade upon the deck. After a few\r\nminutes, he took a seat near his travelling companion, filled his pipe,\r\nand struck four matches in a vain effort to light it. Then, as he had\r\nno more matches, he arose and said to a gentleman who was sitting near\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I trouble you for a match?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman opened a box of matches and struck one. The flame lighted\r\nup his face. Sholmes recognized him\xe2\x80\x94it was Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\n\r\nIf the Englishman had not given an almost imperceptible movement of\r\nsurprise, Lupin would have supposed that his presence on board had been\r\nknown to Sholmes, so well did he control his feelings and so natural\r\nwas the easy manner in which he extended his hand to his adversary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s the good health, Monsieur Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lupin, who could not repress a cry of admiration at\r\nthe Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s sang-froid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo? and why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because I appear before you like a ghost, only a few hours after\r\nyou saw me drowned in the Seine; and through pride\xe2\x80\x94a quality that is\r\nessentially English\xe2\x80\x94you evince not the slightest surprise. You greet me\r\nas a matter of course. Ah! I repeat: Bravo! Admirable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing remarkable about it. From the manner in which you\r\nfell from the boat, I knew very well that you fell voluntarily, and\r\nthat the bullet had not touched you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you went away without knowing what had become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat had become of you? Why, I knew that. There were at least five\r\nhundred people on the two banks of the river within a space of\r\nhalf-a-mile. If you escaped death, your capture was certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Lupin, there are two men in the world at whom I am never\r\nastonished: in the first place, myself\xe2\x80\x94and then, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace was concluded.\r\n\r\nIf Sholmes had not been successful in his contests with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin;\r\nif Lupin remained the only enemy whose capture he must never hope to\r\naccomplish; if, in the course of their struggles, he had not always\r\ndisplayed a superiority, the Englishman had, none the less, by means of\r\nhis extraordinary intuition and tenacity, succeeded in recovering the\r\nJewish lamp as well as the blue diamond.\r\n\r\nThis time, perhaps, the finish had not been so brilliant, especially\r\nfrom the standpoint of the public spectators, since Sholmes was\r\nobliged to maintain a discreet silence in regard to the circumstances\r\nin which the Jewish lamp had been recovered, and to announce that he\r\ndid not know the name of the thief. But as man to man, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nagainst Herlock Sholmes, detective against burglar, there was neither\r\nvictor nor vanquished. Each of them had won corresponding victories.\r\n\r\nTherefore they could now converse as courteous adversaries who had lain\r\ndown their arms and held each other in high regard.\r\n\r\nAt Sholmes\xe2\x80\x99 request, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin related the strange story of his\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I may dignify it by calling it an escape,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was so\r\nsimple! My friends were watching for me, as I had asked them to meet me\r\nthere to recover the Jewish lamp. So, after remaining a good half-hour\r\nunder the overturned boat, I took advantage of an occasion when\r\nFolenfant and his men were searching for my dead body along the bank of\r\nthe river, to climb on top of the boat. Then my friends simply picked\r\nme up as they passed by in their motor-boat, and we sailed away under\r\nthe staring eyes of an astonished multitude, including Ganimard and\r\nFolenfant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sholmes, \xe2\x80\x9cvery neatly played. And now you have\r\nsome business in England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, some accounts to square up.... But I forgot ... what about\r\nMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll! my dear Sholmes, what did I tell you? The wrong is now\r\nirreparable. Would it not have been better to have allowed me to carry\r\nout the affair in my own way? In a day or two more, I should have\r\nrecovered the stolen goods from Bresson, restored them to Monsieur\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle, and those two honest citizens would have lived together\r\nin peace and happiness ever after. Instead of that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes, sneeringly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have mixed the cards\r\nand sown the seeds of discord in the bosom of a family that was under\r\nyour protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu! of course, I was protecting them. Must a person steal, cheat\r\nand wrong all the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you do good, also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have the time. Besides, I find it amusing. Now, for instance,\r\nin our last adventure, I found it extremely diverting that I should be\r\nthe good genius seeking to help and save unfortunate mortals, while you\r\nwere the evil genius who dispensed only despair and tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTears! Tears!\xe2\x80\x9d protested Sholmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly! The d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle household is demolished, and Alice Demun\r\nweeps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe could not remain any longer. Ganimard would have discovered her\r\nsome day, and, through her, reached Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, monsieur; but whose fault is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo men passed by. Sholmes said to Lupin, in a friendly tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know those gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I recognized one of them as the captain of the steamer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Austin Gilett, who occupies in London a position similar to that\r\nof Monsieur Dudouis in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! how fortunate! Will you be so kind as to introduce me? Monsieur\r\nDudouis is one of my best friends, and I shall be delighted to say as\r\nmuch of Monsieur Austin Gilett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen passed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I should take you at your word, Monsieur Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sholmes,\r\nrising, and seizing Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s wrist with a hand of iron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you grasp me so tightly, monsieur? I am quite willing to follow\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, he allowed himself to be dragged along without the least\r\nresistance. The two gentlemen were disappearing from sight. Sholmes\r\nquickened his pace. His finger-nails even sank into Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! Come!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a sort of feverish haste, in harmony\r\nwith his action. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! quicker than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he stopped suddenly. Alice Demun was following them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing, Mademoiselle? You need not come. You must not\r\ncome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Lupin who replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will notice, monsieur, that she is not coming of her own free\r\nwill. I am holding her wrist in the same tight grasp that you have on\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wish to present her also. Her part in the affair of the\r\nJewish lamp is much more important than mine. Accomplice of Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin, accomplice of Bresson, she has a right to tell her adventure\r\nwith the Baroness d\xe2\x80\x99Imblevalle\xe2\x80\x94which will deeply interest Monsieur\r\nGilett as an officer of the law. And by introducing her also, you will\r\nhave carried your gracious intervention to the very limit, my dear\r\nSholmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman released his hold on his prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s wrist. Lupin\r\nliberated Mademoiselle.\r\n\r\nThey stood looking at each other for a few seconds, silently and\r\nmotionless. Then Sholmes returned to the bench and sat down, followed\r\nby Lupin and the girl. After a long silence, Lupin said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\r\nmonsieur, whatever we may do, we will never be on the same side. You\r\nare on one side of the fence; I am on the other. We can exchange\r\ngreetings, shake hands, converse a moment, but the fence is always\r\nthere. You will remain Herlock Sholmes, detective, and I, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,\r\ngentleman-burglar. And Herlock Sholmes will ever obey, more or less\r\nspontaneously, with more or less propriety, his instinct as a\r\ndetective, which is to pursue the burglar and run him down, if\r\npossible. And Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, in obedience to his burglarious instinct,\r\nwill always be occupied in avoiding the reach of the detective, and\r\nmaking sport of the detective, if he can do it. And, this time, he can\r\ndo it. Ha-ha-ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe burst into a loud laugh, cunning, cruel and odious.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly becoming serious, he addressed Alice Demun:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure, mademoiselle, even when reduced to the last\r\nextremity, I shall not betray you. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin never betrays\r\nanyone\xe2\x80\x94especially those whom he loves and admires. And, may I be\r\npermitted to say, I love and admire the brave, dear woman you have\r\nproved yourself to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took from his pocket a visiting card, tore it in two, gave one-half\r\nof it to the girl, as he said, in a voice shaken with emotion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Monsieur Sholmes\xe2\x80\x99 plans for you do not succeed, mademoiselle, go to\r\nLady Strongborough\xe2\x80\x94you can easily find her address\xe2\x80\x94and give her that\r\nhalf of the card, and, at the same time, say to her: _Faithful friend_.\r\nLady Strongborough will show you the true devotion of a sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall see her to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Monsieur Sholmes,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lupin, with the satisfied air of\r\na gentleman who has fulfilled his duty, \xe2\x80\x9cI will say good-night. We will\r\nnot land for an hour yet, so I will get that much rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lay down on the bench, with his hands beneath his head.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the high cliffs of the English coast loomed up in the\r\nincreasing light of a new-born day. The passengers emerged from the\r\ncabins and crowded the deck, eagerly gazing on the approaching shore.\r\nAustin Gilette passed by, accompanied by two men whom Sholmes\r\nrecognized as sleuths from Scotland Yard.\r\n\r\nLupin was asleep, on his bench.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The further startling, wonderful and thrilling adventures of \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin\xe2\x80\x9d will be found in the book entitled \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nGentleman-Burglar\xe2\x80\x9d._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN VS HERLOCK SHOLMES ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
