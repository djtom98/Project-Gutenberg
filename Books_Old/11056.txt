Harper\r\n\r\nEdited by Frances Smith Foster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, that child! She is the very torment of my life. I have been the\r\nmother of six children, and all of them put together, never gave me as\r\nmuch trouble as that girl. I don\'t know what will ever become of her."\r\n\r\n"What is the matter now, Aunt Susan? What has Annette been doing?"\r\n\r\n"Doing! She is always doing something; everlastingly getting herself\r\ninto trouble with some of the neighbors. She is the most mischievous and\r\nhard-headed child I ever saw."\r\n\r\n"Well what has she been doing this morning which has so upset you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I sent her to the grocery to have the oil can filled, and after\r\nshe came back she had not been in the house five minutes before there\r\ncame such an uproar from Mrs. Larkins\', my next door neighbor, that I\r\nthought her house was on fire, but----"\r\n\r\n"Instead of that her tongue was on fire, and I know what that means."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s just it, and I don\'t wonder. That little minx sitting up\r\nthere in the corner looking so innocent, stopped to pour oil on her\r\nclean steps. Now you know yourself what an aggravating thing that must\r\nhave been."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it must have been, especially as Mrs. Larkins is such a nice\r\nhousekeeper and takes such pride in having everything neat and nice\r\nabout her. How did you fix up matters with her."\r\n\r\n"I have not fixed them up at all. Mrs. Larkins only knows one cure for\r\nbad children, and that is beating them, and she always blames me for\r\nspoiling Annette, but I hardly know what to do with her. I\'ve scolded\r\nand scolded till my tongue is tired, whipping don\'t seem to do her a bit\r\nof good, and I hate to put her out among strangers for fear that they\r\nwill not treat her right, for after all she is very near to me. She is\r\nmy poor, dead Lucy\'s child. Sometimes when I get so angry with her that\r\nI feel as though I could almost shake the life out of her, the thought\r\nof her dying mother comes back to me and it seems to me as if I could\r\nsee her eyes looking so wistfully on the child and turning so trustingly\r\nto me and saying, \'Mother, when I am gone won\'t you take care of\r\nAnnette, and try to keep her with you?\' And then all the anger dies out\r\nof me. Poor child! I don\'t know what is going to become of her when my\r\nhead is laid low. I\'m afraid she is born for trouble. Nobody will ever\r\nput up with her as I do. She has such an unhappy disposition. She is not\r\nlike any of my children ever were."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I\'ve often noticed that she does seem different from other\r\nchildren. She never seems light-hearted and happy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is so. She reminds me so of poor Lucy before she was born.\r\nShe even moans in her sleep like she used to do. It was a dark day when\r\nFrank Miller entered my home and Lucy became so taken up with him. It\r\nseemed to me as if my poor girl just worshiped him. I did not feel that\r\nhe was all right, and I tried to warn my dear child of danger, but what\r\ncould an old woman like me do against him with his handsome looks and\r\noily tongue."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said her neighbor soothingly, "you have had a sad time, but\r\nstill we cannot recall the dead past, and it is the living present with\r\nwhich we have to deal. Annette needs wise guidance, a firm hand and a\r\nloving heart to deal with her. To spoil her at home is only to prepare\r\nher for misery abroad."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid that I am not equal to the task."\r\n\r\n"If any man lack wisdom we are taught to ask it of One who giveth\r\nliberally to all men and upbraideth none. There would be so much less\r\nstumbling if we looked earnestly within for \'the light which lighteth\r\nevery man that cometh into the world.\'"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mrs. Harcourt, Annette\'s grandmother, "there is one thing\r\nabout Annette that I like. She is very attentive to her books. If you\r\nwant to keep that child out of mischief just put a book in her hand; but\r\nthen she has her living to get and she can\'t get it by nursing her hands\r\nand reading books. She has got to work like the rest of us."\r\n\r\n"But why not give her a good education? Doors are open to her which were\r\nclosed against us. This is a day of light and knowledge. I don\'t know\r\nmuch myself, but I mean to give my girls a chance. I don\'t believe in\r\nsaying, let my children do as I have done, when I think some of us have\r\ndone poorly enough digging and delving from morning till night. I don\'t\r\nbelieve the good Lord ever sent anybody into his light and beautiful\r\nworld to be nothing but a drudge, and I just think it is because some\r\ntake it so easy that others, who will do, have to take it so hard."\r\n\r\n"It always makes my blood boil," said a maiden lady who was present, "to\r\nsee a great hulk of a man shambling around complaining of hard times,\r\nand that he can\'t get work, when his wife is just working herself down\r\nto the grave to keep up the family." I asked Mrs. Johnson, who just\r\nlives in the wash tub and is the main stay of her family, what would her\r\nhusband do if she were to die? and she said, \'get another wife.\' Now, I\r\njust think she has spoiled that man and if she dies first, I hope that\r\nhe will never find another woman to tread in her footsteps. He ought to\r\nhave me to deal with. When he got through with me he would never want\r\nto laze around another woman."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he ever would," said Mrs. Harcourt, while a gleam of\r\nhumor sparkled in her eye. Her neighbor was a maiden lady who always\r\nknew how to manage other people\'s husbands, but had never succeeded in\r\ngetting one of her own, and not having any children herself understood\r\nperfectly well how to rate other people\'s.\r\n\r\nJust then a knock was heard at the door and Mr. Thomas, Annette\'s former\r\nschool teacher, entered the room. After an exchange of courtesies he\r\nasked, "How does Annette come on with her new teacher?"\r\n\r\n"I have not heard any complaint," said Mrs. Harcourt. "At first Mrs.\r\nJoseph\'s girl did not want to sit with Annette, but she soon got over it\r\nwhen she saw how well the other girls treated Annette and how pleasant\r\nthe teacher was to her. Mr. Scott, who has been so friendly to us, told\r\nus not to mind her; that her mother had been an ignorant servant girl,\r\nwho had married a man with a little money; that she was still ignorant,\r\nloud and [dressy?] and liked to put on airs. The nearer the beggar the\r\ngreater the prejudice."\r\n\r\n"I think it is true," said Mr. Thomas. "If you apply those words, not to\r\ncondition, but human souls, for none but beggarly souls would despise a\r\nman because of circumstances over which he had no control; noble,\r\nlarge-hearted men and women are never scornful. Contempt and ridicule\r\nare the weapons of weak souls. I am glad however, that Annette is\r\ngetting on so well. I hope that she will graduate at the head of her\r\nclass, with high honors."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of giving her so much education? there are no openings\r\nfor her here, and if she gets married she won\'t want it," and Mrs.\r\nHarcourt sighed as she finished her sentence.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas looked grave for a moment and then his face relaxed into a\r\nsmile. "Well, really, Mrs. Harcourt, that is not very complimentary to\r\nus young men; do we have no need of intelligent and well educated\r\nwives? I think our race needs educated mothers for the home more than we\r\ndo trained teachers for the school room. Not that I would ignore or\r\nspeak lightly of the value of good colored teachers nor suggest as a\r\nrace, that we can well afford to do without them; but to-day, if it were\r\nleft to my decision, whether the education of the race should be placed\r\nin the hands of the school teacher or the mothers and there was no other\r\nalternative, I should, by all means, decide for the education of the\r\nrace through its motherhood rather than through its teachers."\r\n\r\n"But we poor mothers had no chance. We could not teach our children."\r\n\r\n"I think you could teach some of them more than they wish to learn; but\r\nI must go now; at some other time we will talk on this subject."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, Annette!" said Mrs. Harcourt, turning to her granddaughter after\r\nMr. Thomas had left the door; "What makes you so naughty? Why did you\r\npour that oil on Mrs. Larkin\'s steps; didn\'t you know it was wrong?"\r\n\r\nAnnette stood silent looking like a guilty culprit.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you answer me; what makes you behave so bad?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, grandma, I \'specs I did it for the devil. The preacher\r\nsaid the devil makes people do bad things."\r\n\r\n"The preacher didn\'t say any such thing; he said the devil tempts people\r\nto be bad, but you are not to mind every thing the devil tells you to\r\ndo, if you do, you will get yourself into a lot of trouble."\r\n\r\n"Well, grandma, Mrs. Larkins is so mean and cross and she is always\r\ntelling tales on me and I just did it for fun."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is very poor fun. You deserve a good whipping, and I\'ve a\r\ngreat mind to give it to you now."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t she let me alone; she is all the time trying to get you to\r\nbeat me. She\'s a spiteful old thing anyhow. I don\'t like her, and I know\r\nshe don\'t like me."\r\n\r\n"Hush Annette, you must not talk that way of any one so much older than\r\nyourself. When I was a child I wouldn\'t have talked that way about any\r\nold person. Don\'t let me hear you talk that way again. You will never\r\nrest till I give you a good whipping."\r\n\r\n"Yes ma\'m," said Annette very demurely.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Annette!" said her grandmother with a sudden burst of feeling. "You\r\ndo give me so much trouble. You give me more worry than all my six\r\nchildren put together; but there is always one scabby sheep in the flock\r\nand you will be that one. Now get ready for school and don\'t let me hear\r\nany more complaints about you; I am not going to let you worry me to\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\nAnnette took up her bonnet and glided quietly out of the door, glad to\r\nreceive instead of the threatened whipping a liberal amount of talk, and\r\nyet the words struck deeper than blows. Her own grandmother had\r\nprophesied evil things of her. She was to be the scabby sheep of the\r\nflock. The memory of the blows upon her body might have passed soon away\r\nafter the pain and irritation of the infliction were over, but that\r\ninconsiderate prophecy struck deep into her heart and left its impress\r\nupon her unfolding life. Without intending it, Mrs. Harcourt had struck\r\na blow at the child\'s self-respect; one of the things which she should\r\nhave strengthened, even if it was "ready to die." Annette had entered\r\nlife sadly handicapped. She was the deserted child of a selfish and\r\nunprincipled man and a young mother whose giddiness and lack of\r\nself-control had caused her to trail the robes of her womanhood in the\r\ndust. With such an ante-natal history how much she needed judicious, but\r\ntender, loving guidance. In that restless, sensitive and impulsive child\r\nwas the germ of a useful woman with a warm, loving heart, ready to\r\nrespond to human suffering, capable of being faithful in friendship and\r\ndevoted in love. Before that young life with its sad inheritance seemed\r\nto lay a future of trial, and how much, humanly speaking, seemed to\r\ndepend upon the right training of that life and the development within\r\nher of self-control, self-reliance and self-respect. There was no\r\nmother\'s heart for her to nestle upon in her hours of discouragement and\r\nperplexity; no father\'s strong, loving arms to shelter and defend her;\r\nno sister to brighten her life with joyous companionship, and no brother\r\nto champion her through the early and impossible period of ripening\r\nwomanhood. Her grandmother was kind to her, but not very tender and\r\nloving. Her struggle to keep the wolf from the door had absorbed her\r\nlife, and although she was neither hard nor old, yet she was not\r\ndemonstrative in her affections, and to her a restless child was an\r\nenigma she did not know how to solve. If the child were hungry or cold\r\nshe could understand physical wants, but for the hunger of the heart she\r\nhad neither sympathy nor comprehension. Fortunately Annette had found a\r\nfriend who understood her better than her grandmother, and who, looking\r\nbeneath the perverseness of the child, saw in her rich possibilities,\r\nand would often speak encouragingly to her. Annette early developed a\r\nlove for literature and poetry and would sometimes try to make rhymes\r\nand string verses together and really Mrs. Lasette thought that she had\r\ntalent or even poetic genius and ardently wished that it might be\r\ncultivated and rightly directed; but it never entered the minds of her\r\ngrandmother and aunts that in their humble home was a rarely gifted soul\r\ndestined to make music which would set young hearts to thrilling with\r\nhigher hopes and loftier aspirations.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lasette had been her teacher before she married. After she became a\r\nwife and mother, instead of becoming entirely absorbed in a round of\r\nhousehold cares and duties, the moment the crown of motherhood fell upon\r\nher, as she often said, she had poured a new interest into the welfare\r\nof her race.[1] With these feelings she soon became known as a friend\r\nand helper in the community in which she lived. Young girls learned to\r\nlook to her for council and encouragement amid the different passages of\r\ntheir [lives?] sometimes with blushing cheeks they whispered in to her\r\nears tender secrets they did not always bring to their near relatives,\r\nand young men about to choose their life work, often came to consult her\r\nand to all her heart was responsive. With this feeling of confidence in\r\nher judgment, Mr. Thomas had entered her home after leaving Mrs.\r\nHarcourt\'s, educating himself for a teacher. He had spent several years\r\nin the acquisition of knowledge and was proving himself an acceptable\r\nand conscientious teacher, when the change came which deprived him of\r\nhis school, by blending his pupils in the different ward schools of the\r\ncity. Public opinion which moves slowly, had advanced far enough to\r\nadmit the colored children into the different schools, irrespective of\r\ncolor, but it was not prepared, except in a few places to admit the\r\ncolored teachers as instructors in the schools. "What are you going to\r\ndo next?" inquired Mrs. Lasette of Mr. Thomas as he seated himself\r\nsomewhat wearily by the fire. "I hardly know, I am all at sea, but I am\r\ngoing to be like the runaway slave who, when asked, \'Where is your\r\npass?\' raised his fist and said \'Dem is my passes,\' and if \'I don\'t see\r\nan opening I will make one.\'"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you go into the ministry? When Mr. Pugh failed in his\r\nexamination he turned his attention to the ministry, and it is said that\r\nhe is succeeding admirably."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lasette, I was brought up to respect the institutions of religion,\r\nand not to lay rash hands on sacred things, and while I believe that\r\nevery man should preach Christ by an upright life, and chaste\r\nconversation, yet I think one of the surest ways to injure a Church, and\r\nto make the pulpit lose its power over the rising generation, is for men\r\nwithout a true calling, or requisite qualifications to enter the\r\nministry because they have failed in some other avocation and find in\r\npreaching an open door to success."\r\n\r\n"But they often succeed."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Why by getting into good churches, increasing their congregations and\r\npaying off large church debts." "And is that necessarily success? We\r\nneed in the Church men who can be more than financiers and who can\r\nattract large congregations. We need earnest thoughtful Christly men,\r\nwho will be more anxious to create and develop moral earnestness than to\r\nexcite transient emotions. Now there is Rev. Mr. Lamson who was educated\r\nin R. College. I have heard him preach to, as I thought, an honest, well\r\nmeaning, but an ignorant congregation, and instead of lifting them to\r\nmore rational forms of worship, he tried to imitate them and made a\r\ncomplete failure. He even tried to moan as they do in worship but it\r\ndidn\'t come out natural."\r\n\r\n"Of course it did not. These dear old people whose moaning during\r\nservice, seems even now so pitiful and weird, I think learned to mourn\r\nout in prayers, thoughts and feelings wrung from their agonizing hearts,\r\nwhich they did not dare express when they were forced to have their\r\nmeetings under the surveillance of a white man."\r\n\r\n"It is because I consider the ministry the highest and most sacred\r\ncalling, that I cannot, nay I dare not, rush into it unless I feel\r\nimpelled by the strongest and holiest motives."\r\n\r\n"You are right and I think just such men as you ought to be in the\r\nministry."\r\n\r\n"Are you calling me?" "I wish it were in my power." "I am glad that it\r\nis not, I think there are more in the ministry now than magnify their\r\ncalling."\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Thomas[2] are you not looking on the dark side of the question?\r\nyou must judge of the sun, not by its spots, but by its brightness."\r\n\r\n"Oh I did not mean to say that the ministry is crowded with unworthy\r\nmen, who love the fleece more than the flock. I believe that there are\r\nin the ministry a large number who are the salt of the earth and whose\r\nlife work bears witness to their fitness. But unfortunately there are\r\nmen who seem so lacking in reverence for God, by their free handling of\r\nsacred things; now I think one of the great wants of our people is more\r\nreverence for God who is above us, and respect for the man who is beside\r\nus, and I do hope that our next minister will be a good man, of active\r\nbrain, warm heart and Christly sympathies, who will be among us a\r\nliving, moral, and spiritual force, and who will be willing to teach us\r\non the Bible plan of \'line upon line, precept upon precept, here a\r\nlittle there a little.\'"\r\n\r\n"I hope he will be; it is said that brother Lomax our new minister is an\r\nexcellent young man."\r\n\r\n"Well I hope that we will not fail to receive him as an apostle and try\r\nto hold up his hands."\r\n\r\n"I hope so. I think that to be called of God to be an ambassador for\r\nChrist, to help him build the kingdom of righteousness, love and peace,\r\namid the misery, sin and strife, is the highest and most blessed\r\nposition that a man can hold, and because I esteem the calling so highly\r\nI would not rush into it unless I felt divinely commissioned."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Harcourt was a Southern woman by birth, who belonged to that class\r\nof colored people whose freedom consisted chiefly in not being the\r\nchattels of the dominant race--a class to whom little was given and from\r\nwhom much was required. She was naturally bright and intelligent, but\r\nhad come up in a day when the very book of the Christian\'s law was to\r\nher a sealed volume; but if she had not been educated through the aid of\r\nschool books and blackboards, she had obtained that culture of manners\r\nand behavior which comes through contact with well-bred people, close\r\nobservation and a sense of self-respect and self-reliance, and when\r\ndeprived of her husband\'s help by an untimely death, she took up the\r\nburden of life bravely and always tried to keep up what she called "a\r\nstiff upper lip." Feeling the cramping of Southern life, she became\r\nrestive under the privations and indignities which were heaped upon free\r\npersons of color, and at length she and her husband broke up their home\r\nand sold out at a pecuniary sacrifice to come North, where they could\r\nbreathe free air and have educational privileges for their children. But\r\nwhile she was strong and healthy her husband, whose health was not very\r\nfirm, soon succumbed to the change of climate and new modes of living\r\nand left Mrs. Harcourt a stranger and widow in a strange land with six\r\nchildren dependent on her for bread and shelter: but during her short\r\nsojourn in the North[3] she had enlisted the sympathy and respect of\r\nkind friends, who came to her relief and helped her to help herself, the\r\nvery best assistance they could bestow upon her. Capable and efficient,\r\nshe found no difficulty in getting work for herself and older children,\r\nwho were able to add their quota to the support of the family by running\r\nerrands, doing odd jobs for the neighbors and helping their mother\r\nbetween school hours. Nor did she lay all the household burdens on the\r\nshoulders of the girls and leave her boys to the mercy of the pavement;\r\nshe tried to make her home happy and taught them all to have a share in\r\nadding to its sunshine. "It makes boys selfish," she would say, "to have\r\ntheir sisters do all the work and let the boys go scot-free. I don\'t\r\nbelieve there would be so many trifling men if the boys were trained to\r\nbe more helpful at home and to feel more for their mothers and sisters."\r\nAll this was very well for the peace and sunshine of that home, but as\r\nthe children advanced in life the question came to her with painful\r\nemphasis----"What can I do for the future of my boys and girls?" She was\r\nnot anxious to have them all professional men and school teachers and\r\ngovernment clerks, but she wanted each one to have some trade or calling\r\nby which a respectable and comfortable living could be made; but first\r\nshe consulted their tastes and inclinations. Her youngest boy was very\r\nfond of horses, but instead of keeping him in the city, where he was in\r\ndanger of getting too intimate with horse jockeys and stable boys, she\r\nfound a place for him with an excellent farmer, who, seeing the tastes\r\nof the boy, took great interest in teaching him how to raise stock and\r\nhe became a skillful farmer. Her second son showed that he had some\r\nmechanical skill and ingenuity and she succeeded in getting him a\r\nsituation with a first-class carpenter, and spared no pains to have him\r\nwell instructed in all the branches of carpentry, and would often say to\r\nhim, "John, don\'t do any sham work if you are going to be a carpenter;\r\nbe thorough in every thing you do and try to be the best carpenter in\r\nA.P., and if you do your work better than others, you won\'t have to be\r\nall the time going around advertising yourself; somebody will find out\r\nwhat you can do and give you work." Her oldest son was passionately fond\r\nof books and she helped him through school till he was able to become a\r\nschool teacher. But as the young man was high spirited and ambitious, he\r\nresolved that he would make his school teaching a stepping stone to a\r\nmore congenial employment. He studied medicine and graduated with M.D.,\r\nbut as it takes a young doctor some time to gain the confidence of an\r\nold community, he continued after his graduation to teach and obtained a\r\ncertificate to practice medicine. Without being forced to look to his\r\nmother for assistance, while the confidence of his community was slowly\r\ngrowing, he depended on the school for his living and looked to the\r\nfuture for his success as a physician.\r\n\r\nFor the girls, because they were colored, there were but few avenues\r\nopen, but they all took in sewing and were excellent seamstresses,\r\nexcept Lucy, who had gone from home to teach school in a distant city as\r\nthere were no openings of the kind for her at her own home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harcourt was very proud of her children and had unbounded\r\nconfidence in them. She was high-spirited and self-respecting and it\r\nnever seemed to enter her mind that any evil might befall the children\r\nthat would bring sorrow and shame to her home; but nevertheless it came\r\nand Lucy, her youngest child, the pet and pride of the household\r\nreturned home with a great sorrow tugging at her heart and a shadow on\r\nher misguided life. It was the old story of woman\'s weakness and folly\r\nand man\'s perfidy and desertion. Poor child, how wretched she was till\r\n"peace bound up her bleeding heart," and even then the arrow had pierced\r\ntoo deep for healing. Sorrow had wasted her strength and laid the\r\nfoundation of disease and an early death. Religion brought balm to the\r\nwounded spirit, but no renewed vigor to the wasted frame and in a short\r\ntime she fell a victim to consumption, leaving Annette to the care of\r\nher mother. It was so pitiful to see the sorrow on the dear old face as\r\nshe would nestle the wronged and disinherited child to her heart and\r\nwould say so mournfully, "Oh, I never, never expected this!"\r\n\r\nAlthough Annette had come into the family an unbidden and unwelcome\r\nguest, associated with the saddest experience of her grandmother\'s life,\r\nyet somehow the baby fingers had wound themselves around the tendrils of\r\nher heart and the child had found a shelter in the warm clasp of loving\r\narms. To her, Annette was a new charge, an increased burden; but burden\r\nto be defended by her love and guarded by her care. All her other\r\nchildren had married and left her, and in her lowly home this young\r\nchild with infantile sweetness, beguiled many a lonely hour. She loved\r\nLucy and that was Lucy\'s child.\r\n\r\n  But where was he who sullied\r\n    Her once unspotted name;\r\n  Who lured her from life\'s brightness\r\n    To agony and shame?\r\n\r\nDid society, which closed its doors against Lucy and left her to\r\nstruggle as best she might out of the depth into which she had fallen,\r\npour any righteous wrath upon his guilty head? Did it demand that he\r\nshould at least bring forth some fruit meet for repentance by at least\r\nhelping Mrs. Harcourt to raise the unfortunate child? Not so. He left\r\nthat poor old grandmother to struggle with her failing strength, not\r\nonly to bear her own burden, but the one he had so wickedly imposed upon\r\nher. He had left A.P. before Lucy\'s death and gone to the Pacific coast\r\nwhere he became wealthy through liquor selling, speculation, gambling\r\nand other disreputable means, and returned with gold enough to hide a\r\nmultitude of sins, and then fair women permitted and even courted his\r\nsociety. Mothers with marriageable daughters condoned his offences\r\nagainst morality and said, "oh, well, young men will sow their wild\r\noats; it is no use to be too straight laced." But there were a few\r\nthoughtful mothers old fashioned enough to believe that the law of\r\npurity is as binding upon the man as the woman, and who, under no\r\nconditions, would invite him to associate with their daughters. Women\r\nwho tried to teach their sons to be worthy of the love and esteem of\r\ngood women by being as chaste in their conversation and as pure in their\r\nlives as their young daughters who sat at their side sheltered in their\r\npleasant and peaceful homes. One of the first things that Frank Miller\r\ndid after he returned to A.P. was to open a large and elegantly\r\nfurnished saloon and restaurant. The license to keep such a place was\r\nvery high, and men said that to pay it he resorted to very questionable\r\nmeans, that his place was a resort for gamblers, and that he employed a\r\nyoung man to guard the entrance of his saloon from any sudden invasion\r\nof the police by giving a signal without if he saw any of them\r\napproaching, and other things were whispered of his saloon which showed\r\nit to be a far more dangerous place for the tempted, unwary and\r\ninexperienced feet of the young men of A.P., than any low groggery in\r\nthe whole city. Young men who would have scorned to enter the lowest\r\ndens of vice, felt at home in his gilded palace of sin. Beautiful\r\npictures adorned the walls, light streamed into the room through finely\r\nstained glass windows, women, not as God had made them, but as sin had\r\ndebased them, came there to spend the evening in the mazy dance, or to\r\nsit with partners in sin and feast at luxurious tables. Politicians came\r\nthere to concoct their plans for coming campaigns, to fix their slates\r\nand to devise means for grasping with eager hands the spoils of\r\ngovernment. Young men anxious for places in the gift of the government\r\nfound that winking at Frank Miller\'s vices and conforming to the\r\ndemoralizing customs of his place were passports to political favors,\r\nand lacking moral stamina, hushed their consciences and became partakers\r\nof his sins.[4] Men talked in private of his vices, and drank his\r\nliquors and smoked his cigars in public. His place was a snare to their\r\nsouls. "The dead were there but they knew it not." He built a beautiful\r\nhome and furnished it magnificently, and some said that the woman who\r\nmarried him would do well, as if it were possible for any woman to marry\r\nwell who linked her destinies to a wicked, selfish and base man, whose\r\nbusiness was a constant menace to the peace, the purity and progress of\r\nsociety. I believe it was Milton who said that the purity of a man\r\nshould be more splendid than the purity of a woman, basing his idea upon\r\nthe declaration, "The head of the woman is the man, and the head of the\r\nman is Jesus Christ." Surely if man occupies this high rank in the\r\ncreation of God he should ever be the true friend and helper of woman\r\nand not, as he too often proves, her falsest friend and basest enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n\r\n"Annette," said Mrs. Harcourt one morning early, "I want you to stir\r\nyour stumps to-day; I am going to have company this evening and I want\r\nyou to help me to get everything in apple pie order."\r\n\r\n"Who is coming, grandma?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Lasette."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lasette!" Annette\'s eyes brightened. "I hope she will come; she is\r\njust as sweet as a peach and I do love her ever so much; and who else?"\r\n\r\n"Brother Lomax, the minister who preached last Sunday and gave us such a\r\ngood sermon."\r\n\r\n"Is he coming, too?" Annette opened her eyes with pleased surprise. "Oh,\r\nI hope he will come, he\'s so nice."\r\n\r\n"What do you know about him?"\r\n\r\n"Why, grandmother, I understood everything that he said, and I felt that\r\nI wanted to be good just like he told us, and I went and asked aunt\r\n\'Liza how people got religion. She had been to camp-meeting and seen\r\npeople getting religion, and I wanted her to tell me all about it for I\r\nwanted to get it too."\r\n\r\n"What did she tell you?"\r\n\r\n"She told me that people went down to the mourner\'s bench and prayed and\r\nthen they would get up and shout and say they had religion, and that was\r\nall she knew about it."\r\n\r\n"You went to the wrong one when you went to your aunt \'Liza. And what\r\ndid you do after she told you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I went down in the garden and prayed and I got up and shouted, but\r\nI didn\'t get any religion. I guess I didn\'t try right."\r\n\r\n"I guess you didn\'t if I judge by your actions. When you get older you\r\nwill know more about it."\r\n\r\n"But, grandma, Aunt \'Liza is older than I am, why don\'t she know?"\r\n\r\n"Because she don\'t try; she\'s got her head too full of dress and dancing\r\nand nonsense."\r\n\r\nGrandmother Harcourt did not have very much faith in what she called\r\nchildren\'s religion, and here was a human soul crying out in the\r\ndarkness; but she did not understand the cry, nor look for the\r\n"perfecting of praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings," not\r\ndiscerning the emotions of that young spirit, she let the opportunity\r\nslip for rightly impressing that young soul. She depended too much on\r\nthe church and too little on the training of the home. For while the\r\nchurch can teach and the school instruct, the home is the place to train\r\ninnocent and impressible childhood for useful citizenship on earth and a\r\nhope of holy companionship in heaven; and every Christian should strive\r\nto have "her one of the provinces of God\'s kingdom," where she can plant\r\nher strongest batteries against the ramparts of folly, sin and vice.\r\n\r\n"Who else is coming, grandma?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course I must invite Mrs. Larkins; it would never do to leave\r\nher out."\r\n\r\nAnnette shrugged her shoulders, a scowl came over her face and she said:\r\n\r\n"I hope she won\'t come."\r\n\r\n"I expect she will and when she comes I want you to behave yourself and\r\ndon\'t roll up your eyes at her and giggle at her and make ugly speeches.\r\nShe told me that you made mouths at her yesterday, and that when Mr.\r\nRoss was whipping his horse you said you knew some one whom you wished\r\nwas getting that beating, and she said that she just believed you meant\r\nher. How was that, Annette? If I were like you I would be all the time\r\nkeeping this neighborhood in hot water."\r\n\r\nAnnette looked rather crestfallen and said, "I did make mouths at her\r\nhouse as I came by, but I didn\'t know that she saw me."\r\n\r\n"Yes she did, and you had better mind how you cut your cards with her."\r\n\r\nAnnette finding the conversation was taking a rather disagreeable turn\r\nsuddenly remembered that she had something to do in the yard and ceased\r\nto prolong the dialogue. If the truth must be confessed, Annette was not\r\na very earnest candidate for saintship, and annoying her next door\r\nneighbor was one of her favorite amusements.\r\n\r\nGrandma Harcourt lived in a secluded court, which was shut in on every\r\nside but one from the main streets, and her environments were not of the\r\nmost pleasant and congenial kind. The neighbors, generally speaking,\r\nbelonged to neither the best nor worst class of colored people. The\r\ncourt was too fully enclosed to be a thoroughfare of travel, but it was\r\na place in which women could sit at their doors and talk to one another\r\nfrom each side of the court. Women who had no scruples about drinking as\r\nmuch beer, and sometimes stronger drinks, as they could absorb, and some\r\nof the men said that the women drank more than men, and under the\r\nbesotting influence of beer and even stronger drinks, a fearful amount\r\nof gossiping, news-carrying and tattling went on, which often resulted\r\nin quarrels and contentions, which, while it never resulted in blood,\r\nsadly lowered the tone of social life. It was the arena of wordy strife\r\nin which angry tongues were the only weapons of warfare, and poor little\r\nAnnette was fast learning their modes of battle. But there was one thing\r\nagainst which grandmother Harcourt set her face like flint, and that was\r\nsending children to saloons for beer, and once she flamed out with\r\nrighteous indignation when one of her neighbors, in her absence, sent\r\nAnnette to a saloon to buy her some beer. She told her in emphatic terms\r\nshe must never do so again, that she wanted her girl to grow up a\r\nrespectable woman, and that she ought to be ashamed of herself, not only\r\nto be guzzling beer like a toper, but to send anybody\'s child to a\r\nsaloon to come in contact with the kind of men who frequented such\r\nplaces, and that any women who sent their children to such places were\r\ntraining their boys to be drunkards and their girls to be\r\nstreet-walkers. "I am poor," she said, "but I mean to keep my credit up\r\nand if you and I live in this neighborhood a hundred years you must\r\nnever do that thing again."\r\n\r\nHer neighbor looked dazed and tried to stammer out an apology, but she\r\nnever sent Annette to a beer saloon again, and in course of time she\r\nbecame a good temperance woman herself, influenced by the faithfulness\r\nof grandmother Harcourt.\r\n\r\nThe court in which Mrs. Harcourt lived was not a very desirable place,\r\nbut, on account of her color, eligible houses could not always be\r\nobtained, and however decent, quiet or respectable she might appear on\r\napplying for a house, she was often met with the rebuff, "We don\'t rent\r\nto colored people," and men who virtually assigned her race the lowest\r\nplace and humblest positions could talk so glibly of the degradation of\r\nthe Negro while by their Christless and inhuman prejudice they were\r\nhelping add to their low social condition. In the midst of her\r\nunfavorable environments Mrs. Harcourt kept her home neat and tidy; sent\r\nAnnette to school constantly and tried to keep her out of mischief, but\r\nthere was moral contagion in the social atmosphere of Tennis Court and\r\nAnnette too often succumbed to its influence; but Annette was young and\r\nliked the company of young girls and it seemed cruel to confine the\r\nchild\'s whole life to the home and schoolhouse and give her no chance to\r\nbe merry and playful with girls of her own age. So now and then\r\ngrandmother Harcourt would let her spend a little time with some of the\r\nneighbors\' girls but from the questions that Annette often asked her\r\ngrandmother and the conversations she sometimes repeated Mrs. Harcourt\r\nfeared that she was learning things which should only be taught by\r\nfaithful mothers in hours of sacred and tender confidence, and she\r\ndetermined, even if it gave offence to her neighbors, that she would\r\nchoose among her own friends, companions for her granddaughter and not\r\nleave all her social future to chance. In this she was heartily aided by\r\nMrs. Lasette, who made it a point to hold in that neighborhood, mothers\'\r\nmeetings and try to teach mothers, who in the dark days of slavery had\r\nno bolts nor bars strong enough to keep out the invader from scattering\r\ntheir children like leaves in wintry weather, how to build up light and\r\nhappy homes under the new dispensation of freedom. To her it was a\r\nlabor of love and she found her reward in the peace and love which\r\nflowed into the soul and the improved condition of society. In lowly\r\nhomes where she visited, her presence was a benediction and an\r\ninspiration. Women careless in their household and slatternly in their\r\ndress grew more careful in the keeping of their homes and the\r\narrangement of their attire. Women of the better class of their own\r\nrace, coming among them awakened their self-respect. Prejudice and pride\r\nof race had separated them from their white neighbors and the more\r\ncultured of their race had shrunk from them in their ignorance, poverty\r\nand low social condition and they were left, in a great measure, to\r\nthemselves--ostracised by the whites on the one side and socially\r\nisolated from the more cultured of their race on the other hand. The law\r\ntook little or no cognizance of them unless they were presented at its\r\nbar as criminals; but if they were neither criminals nor paupers they\r\nmight fester in their vices and perpetuate their social condition. Who\r\nunderstood or cared to minister to their deepest needs or greatest\r\nwants? It was just here where the tender, thoughtful love of a\r\nwarm-hearted and intelligent woman was needed. To her it was a labor of\r\nlove, but it was not all fair sailing. She sometimes met with coldness\r\nand distrust where she had expected kindness and confidence; lack of\r\nsympathy where she had hoped to find ready and willing cooperation; but\r\nshe knew that if her life was in harmony with God and Christly sympathy\r\nwith man; for such a life there was no such word as fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n\r\nBy dint of energy and perseverance grandmother Harcourt had succeeded in\r\ngetting everything in order when her guests began to arrive. She had\r\njust put the finishing touches upon her well-spread table and was\r\nreviewing it with an expression of pleasure and satisfaction. And now\r\nwhile the guests are quietly taking their seats let me introduce you to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas came bringing with him the young minister, Rev. Mr. Lomax,\r\nwhose sermon had so interested and edified Mrs. Harcourt the previous\r\nSunday. Mrs. Lasette, looking bright and happy, came with her daughter,\r\nand Mrs. Larkins entered arrayed in her best attire, looking starched\r\nand prim, as if she had made it the great business of her life to take\r\ncare of her dignity and to think about herself. Mrs. Larkins,[5] though\r\nfor years a member of church, had not learned that it was unchristian to\r\nbe narrow and selfish. She was strict in her attendance at church and\r\ngave freely to its support; but somehow with all her attention to the\r\nforms of religion, one missed its warm and vivifying influence from her\r\nlife, and in the loving clasp of a helping hand, in the tender beam of a\r\nsympathizing glance, weary-hearted mothers and wives never came to her\r\nwith their heartaches and confided to her their troubles. Little\r\nchildren either shrank from her or grew quiet in her presence. What was\r\nmissing from her life was the magnetism of love. She had become so\r\nabsorbed in herself that she forgot everybody else and thought more of\r\nher rights than her duties. The difference between Mrs. Lasette and Mrs.\r\nLarkins was this, that in passing through life one scattered sunshine\r\nand the other cast shadows over her path. Mrs. Lasette was a fine\r\nconversationalist. She regarded speech as one of heaven\'s best gifts,\r\nand thought that conversation should be made one of the finest arts, and\r\nused to subserve the highest and best purposes of life, and always\r\nregretted when it was permitted to degenerate into gossip and\r\nbackbiting. Harsh judgment she always tried to modify, often saying in\r\ndoubtful cases, "Had we not better suspend our judgments? Truly we do\r\nnot like people to think the worst of us and it is not fulfilling the\r\nlaw of love to think the worst of them. Do you not know that if we wish\r\nto dwell in his tabernacle we are not to entertain a reproach against\r\nour neighbor, nor to back-bite with our lips and I do not think there is\r\na sin which more easily besets society than this." "Speech," she would\r\nsay, "is a gift so replete with rich and joyous possibilities," and she\r\nalways tried to raise the tone of conversation at home and abroad. Of\r\nher it might be emphatically said, "She opened her mouth with wisdom and\r\nin her lips was the law of kindness."\r\n\r\nThe young minister, Rev. Mr. Lomax, was an earnest, devout and gifted\r\nyoung man. Born in the midst of poverty, with the shadows of slavery\r\nencircling his early life, he had pushed his way upward in the world,\r\n"toiling while others slept." His father was dead. While living he had\r\ndone what he could to improve the condition of his family, and had, it\r\nwas thought, overworked himself in the struggle to educate and support\r\nhis children. He was a kind and indulgent father and when his son had\r\nmade excellent progress in his studies, he gave him two presents so dear\r\nto his boyish heart--a gun and a watch. But the hour came when the\r\nloving hands were closed over the quiet breast, and the widowed wife\r\nfound herself unable to provide the respectable funeral she desired to\r\ngive him. Thomas then came bravely and tenderly to her relief. He sold\r\nhis watch and gun to defray the funeral expenses of his father. He was a\r\ngood son to his aged mother, and became the staff of her declining\r\nyears. With an earnest purpose in his soul, and feeling that knowledge\r\nis power, he applied himself with diligence to his studies, passed\r\nthrough college, and feeling within his soul a commission to teach and\r\nhelp others to develop within themselves the love of nature, he entered\r\nthe ministry, bringing into it an enthusiasm for humanity and love of\r\nChrist, which lit up his life and made him a moral and spiritual force\r\nin the community. He had several advantageous offers to labor in other\r\nparts of the country, but for the sake of being true to the heavenly\r\nvision, which showed him the needs of his people and his adaptation to\r\ntheir wants, he chose, not the most lucrative, but the most needed work\r\nwhich was offered him with\r\n\r\n  A joy to find in every station,\r\n  Something still to do or bear.\r\n\r\nHe had seen many things in the life of the people with whom he was\r\nidentified which gave him intense pain, but instead of constantly\r\ncensuring and finding fault with their inconsistencies of conscience, he\r\nstrove to live so blamelessly before them that he would show them by\r\nexample a more excellent way and "criticise by creation." To him\r\nreligion was a reasonable service and he wished it to influence their\r\nconduct as well as sway their emotions. Believing that right thinking is\r\nconnected with right living, he taught them to be conservative without\r\nbeing bigoted, and liberal without being morally indifferent and\r\ncareless in their modes of thought. He wanted them to be able to give a\r\nreason for the faith that was in them and that faith to be rooted and\r\ngrounded in love. He was young, hopeful, and enthusiastic and life was\r\nopening before him full of hope and promise.\r\n\r\n"It has been a beautiful day," said Mrs. Lasette, seating herself beside\r\nMrs. Larkins,[6] who always waited to be approached and was ever ready\r\nto think that some one was slighting her or ignoring her presence.\r\n\r\n"It has been a fine day, but I think it will rain soon; I judge by my\r\ncorn."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I think the weather is just perfect. The sun set gloriously this\r\nevening and the sky was the brightest blue."\r\n\r\n"I think the day was what I call a weather breeder. Whenever you see\r\nsuch days this time of year, you may look out for falling weather. I\r\n[expect?] that it will snow soon."\r\n\r\n"How that child grows," said Mrs. Larkins, as Annette entered the room.\r\n\r\n"Ill weeds grow apace; she has nothing else to do. That girl is going\r\nto give her grandmother a great deal of trouble."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I do not think so."\r\n\r\n"Well, I do, and I told her grandmother so one day, but she did not\r\nthank me for it."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t do it for thanks; I did it just to give her a piece of my mind\r\nabout that girl. She is the most mischievous and worrisome child I ever\r\nsaw. The partition between our houses is very thin and many a time when\r\nI want to finish my morning sleep or take an afternoon nap, if Mrs.\r\nHarcourt is not at home, Annette will sing and recite at the top of her\r\nvoice and run up and down the stairs as if a regiment of soldiers were\r\nafter her."\r\n\r\n"Annette is quite young, full of life and brimful of mischief, and girls\r\nof that age I have heard likened to persimmons before they are ripe; if\r\nyou attempt to eat them they will pucker your mouth, but if you wait\r\ntill the first frost touches them they are delicious. Have patience with\r\nthe child, act kindly towards her, she may be slow in developing womanly\r\nsense, but I think that Annette has within her the making of a fine\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what Annette wants?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know what she wants; but what do you think she wants?"\r\n\r\n"She wants kissing."\r\n\r\n"I\'d kiss her with a switch if she were mine."\r\n\r\n"I do not think it wise to whip a child of her age."\r\n\r\n"I\'d whip her if she were as big as a house."\r\n\r\n"I do not find it necessary with my Laura; it is sufficient to deter her\r\nfrom doing anything if she knows that I do not approve of it. I have\r\ntried to establish perfect confidence between us. I do not think my\r\ndaughter keeps a secret from me. I think many young persons go astray\r\nbecause their parents have failed to strengthen their characters and to\r\nforewarn and forearm them against the temptations and dangers that\r\nsurround their paths. How goes the battle?" said Mrs. Lasette, turning\r\nto Mr. Thomas.\r\n\r\n"I am still at sea, and the tide has not yet turned in my favor. Of\r\ncourse, I feel the change; it has taken my life out of its accustomed\r\nchannel, but I am optimist enough to hope that even this change will\r\nresult in greater good to the greatest number. I think one of our great\r\nwants is the diversification of our industries, and I do not believe it\r\nwould be wise for the parents to relax their endeavors to give their\r\nchildren the best education in their power. We cannot tell what a race\r\ncan do till it utters and expresses itself, and I know that there is an\r\namount of brain among us which can and should be utilized in other\r\ndirections than teaching school or seeking for clerkships. Mr. Clarkson\r\nhad a very intelligent daughter whom he wished to fit for some other\r\nemployment than that of a school teacher. He had her trained for a\r\nphysician. She went to B., studied faithfully, graduated at the head of\r\nher class and received the highest medal for her attainments, thus\r\nproving herself a living argument of the capability in her race. Her\r\nfriend, Miss Young, had artistic talent, and learned wood carving. She\r\ndeveloped exquisite taste and has become a fine artist in that branch of\r\nindustry. A female school teacher\'s work in the public schools is apt to\r\nbe limited to her single life, but a woman who becomes proficient in a\r\nuseful trade or business, builds up for herself a wall of defense\r\nagainst the invasions of want and privation whether she is married or\r\nsingle. I think that every woman, and man too, should be prepared for\r\nthe reverses of fortune by being taught how to do some one thing\r\nthoroughly so as to be able to be a worker in the world\'s service, and\r\nnot a pensioner upon its bounty. And for this end it does not become us\r\nas a race to despise any honest labor which lifts us above pauperism and\r\ndependence. I am pleased to see our people having industrial fairs. I\r\nbelieve in giving due honor to all honest labor, in covering idleness\r\nwith shame, and crowning labor with respect."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n\r\nFor awhile Mrs. Harcourt was busy in preparing the supper, to which they\r\nall did ample justice. In her white apron, faultless neck handkerchief\r\nand nicely fitting, but plain dress, Mrs. Harcourt looked the\r\nimpersonation of contented happiness. Sorrow had left deep furrows upon\r\nher kindly face, but for awhile the shadows seemed to have been lifted\r\nfrom her life and she was the pleasant hostess, forgetting her own\r\nsorrows in contributing to the enjoyment of others. Supper being over,\r\nher guests resumed their conversation.\r\n\r\n"You do not look upon the mixing of the schools as being necessarily\r\ndisadvantageous to our people," said the minister.\r\n\r\n"That," said Mr. Thomas, "is just in accordance to the way we adapt\r\nourselves to the change. If we are to remain in this country as a\r\ncomponent part of the nation, I cannot fail to regard with interest any\r\nstep which tends toward our unification with all the other branches of\r\nthe human race in this Western Hemisphere."\r\n\r\n"Although," said Mrs. Lasette, "I have been educating my daughter and\r\nhave felt very sorry when I have witnessed the disappointment of parents\r\nwho have fitted their children for teachers and have seen door after\r\ndoor closed against them, I cannot help regarding the mixing of the\r\nschools as at least one step in a right direction."\r\n\r\n"But Mrs. Lasette," said the minister, "as we are educated by other\r\nmeans than school books and blackboards, such as the stimulus of hope,\r\nthe incentives of self-respect and the consensus of public opinion, will\r\nit not add to the depression of the race if our children are made to\r\nfeel that, however well educated they may be or exemplary as pupils, the\r\ncolor of their skin must debar them from entering avenues which are\r\nfreely opened to the young girls of every other nationality."\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas replied, "In considering this question, which is so much\r\nbroader than a mere local question, I have tried to look beyond the life\r\nof the individual to the life of the race, and I find that it is through\r\nobstacles overcome, suffering endured and the tests of trial that\r\nstrength is obtained, courage manifested and character developed. We are\r\nnow passing through a crucial period in our race history and what we so\r\nmuch need is moral earnestness, strength of character and purpose to\r\nguide us through the rocks and shoals on which so many life barques have\r\nbeen stranded and wrecked."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Lasette, "I believe that we are capable of being more\r\nthan light-hearted children of the tropics and I want our young people\r\nto gain more persistence in their characters, perseverance in their\r\nefforts and that esprit de corps, which shall animate us with higher,\r\nnobler and holier purpose in the future than we have ever known in the\r\npast; and while I am sorry for the parents who, for their children\'s\r\nsake, have fought against the entailed ignorance of the ages with such\r\nhumble weapons as the washboard, flat iron and scrubbing brush, and who\r\nhave gathered the crumbs from the humblest departments of labor, still I\r\nfeel with Mr. Thomas that the mixing of the schools is a stride in the\r\nmarch of the nation, only we must learn how to keep step in the progress\r\nof the centuries."\r\n\r\n"I do not think that I fully comprehend you," Mr. Lomax replied.\r\n\r\n"Let me explain. I live in the 19th Ward. In that Ward are not a half\r\ndozen colored children. When my husband bought the land we were more\r\nthan a mile from the business part of the city, but we were poor and the\r\nland was very cheap and my husband said that paying rent was like\r\nputting money in a sinking fund; so he resolved, even if it put us to a\r\nlittle disadvantage, that he would buy the tract of land where we now\r\nlive. Before he did so, he called together a number of his\r\nacquaintances, pointed out to them the tract of land and told them how\r\nthey might join with him in planting a small hamlet for themselves; but\r\nexcept the few colored neighbors we now have, no one else would join\r\nwith us. Some said it was too far from their work, others that they did\r\nnot wish to live among many colored people, and some suspected my\r\nhusband of trying either to take the advantage of them, or of\r\nagrandising himself at their expense, and I have now dear friends who\r\nmight have been living comfortably in their own homes, who, to-day, are\r\ncrowded in tenement houses or renting in narrow alleys and little\r\nstreets."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said Mrs. Larkins, "I am one of them. I wanted my husband\r\nto take up with your husband\'s offer, but he was one of those men who\r\nknew it all and he never seemed to think it possible that any colored\r\nman could see any clearer than he did. I knew your husband\'s head was\r\nlevel and I tried to persuade Mr. Larkins to take up with his offer, but\r\nhe would not hear to it; said he knew his own business best, and shut me\r\nup by telling me that he was not going to let any woman rule over him;\r\nand here I am to-day, Larkins gone and his poor old widow scuffing night\r\nand day to keep soul and body together; but there are some men you\r\ncouldn\'t beat anything into their heads, not if you took a sledge\r\nhammer. Poor fellow, he is gone now and I ought not to say anything agin\r\nhim, but if he had minded me, I would have had a home over my head and\r\nsome land under my feet; but it is no use to grieve over spilled milk.\r\nWhen he was living if I said, yes, he was always sure to say, no. One\r\nday I said to him when he was opposing me, the way we live is like the\r\nold saying, \'Pull Dick and pull devil,\' and what do you think he said?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I\'m sure, what was it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, he just looked at me and smiled and said, \'I am Dick.\' Of course\r\nhe meant that I was the other fellow."\r\n\r\n"But," said Mrs. Lasette, "this is a digression from our subject. What\r\nI meant to say is this, that in our Ward is an excellent school house\r\nwith a half score of well equipped and efficient teachers. The former\r\ncolored school house was a dingy looking building about a mile and a\r\nhalf away with only one young school teacher, who had, it is true,\r\npassed a creditable examination. Now, when my daughter saw that the\r\nchildren of all other nationalities, it mattered not how low and\r\ndebasing might be their environments, could enter the school for which\r\nher father paid taxes, and that she was forced either to stay at home or\r\nto go through all weathers to an ungraded school, in a poorly ventilated\r\nand unevenly heated room, would not such public inequality burn into her\r\nsoul the idea of race-inferiority? And this is why I look upon the mixed\r\nschool as a right step in the right direction."\r\n\r\n"Taking this view of the matter I see the pertinence of your position on\r\nthis subject. Do you know," continued Mr. Lomax,[7] his face lighting up\r\nwith a fine enthusiasm, "that I am full of hope for the future of our\r\npeople?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s more than I am," said Mrs. Larkins very coldly. "When you have\r\nsummered and wintered them as I have, you will change your tune."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope not," he replied with an accent of distress in his voice.\r\n"You may think me a dreamer and enthusiast, but with all our faults I\r\nfirmly believe that the Negro belongs to one of the best branches of the\r\nhuman race, and that he has a high and holy mission in the great drama\r\nof life. I do not think our God is a purposeless Being, but his ways are\r\nnot as our ways are, and his thoughts are not our thoughts, and I dare\r\nnot say \'Had I his wisdom or he my love,\' the condition of humanity\r\nwould be better. I prefer thinking that in the crucible of pain and\r\napparent disaster, that we are held by the hand of a loving Father who\r\nis doing for us all, the best he can to fit us for companionship with\r\nhim in the eternities, and with John G. Whittier, I feel:\r\n\r\n  Amid the maddening maze of things\r\n    When tossed by storm and flood,\r\n  To one fixed stake my spirit clings\r\n    I know that God is good.\r\n\r\n"I once questioned and doubted, but now I have learned to love and trust\r\nin \'Him whom the heavens must receive till the time of the restitution\r\nof all things.\' By this trust I do not mean a lazy leaning on Providence\r\nto do for us what we have ability to do for ourselves. I think that our\r\npeople need more to be taught how to live than to be constantly warned\r\nto get ready to die. As Brother Thomas said, we are now passing through\r\na crucial period of our history and what we need is life--more abundant\r\nlife in every fibre of our souls; life which will manifest itself in\r\nmoral earnestness, vigor of purpose, strength of character and spiritual\r\nprogression."\r\n\r\n"I do hope," said Mr. Thomas, "that as you are among us, you will impart\r\nsome of your earnestness and enthusiasm to our young people."\r\n\r\n"As I am a new comer here, and it is said that the people of A.P., are\r\nvery sensitive to criticism, though very critical themselves and rather\r\nset and conservative in their ways, I hope that I shall have the benefit\r\nof your experience in aiding me to do all I can to help the people among\r\nwhom my lot is cast."\r\n\r\n"You are perfectly welcome to any aid I can give you. Just now some of\r\nus are interested in getting our people out of these wretched alleys and\r\ncrowded tenement houses into the larger, freer air of the country. We\r\nwant our young men to help us fight the battle against poverty,\r\nignorance, degradation, and the cold, proud scorn of society. Before our\r\npublic lands are all appropriated, I want our young men and women to get\r\nhomesteads, and to be willing to endure privations in order to place our\r\nmeans of subsistence on a less precarious basis. The land is a basis of\r\npower, and like Anteus in the myth, we will never have our full measure\r\nof material strength till we touch the earth as owners of the soil. And\r\nwhen we get the land we must have patience and perseverance enough to\r\nhold it."\r\n\r\n"In one of our Western States is a city which suggests the idea of\r\nAladdin\'s wonderful lamp. Where that city now stands was once the\r\nhomestead of a colored man who came from Virginia and obtained it under\r\nthe homestead law. That man has since been working as a servant for a\r\nman who lives on 80 acres of his former section, and who has plotted the\r\nrest for the city of C."\r\n\r\n"How did he lose it?"\r\n\r\n"When he came from the South the country was new and female labor in\r\ngreat demand. His wife could earn $1.50 a day, and instead of moving on\r\nhis land, he remained about forty miles away, till he had forfeited his\r\nclaim, and it fell into the hands of the present proprietor. Since then\r\nour foresight has been developing and some months since in travelling in\r\nthat same State, I met a woman whose husband had taken up a piece of\r\nland and was bringing it under cultivation. She and her children\r\nremained in town where they could all get work, and transmit him help\r\nand in a few years, I expect, they will be comfortably situated in a\r\nhome owned by their united efforts."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat next? was the question Mr. Thomas was revolving in his mind, when a\r\nknock was heard at his door, and he saw standing on the threshold, one\r\nof his former pupils.\r\n\r\n"Well, Charley, how does the world use you? Everything going on\r\nswimmingly?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no indeed. I have lost my situation."\r\n\r\n"How is that? You were getting on so well. Mr. Hazleton seemed to be\r\nperfectly satisfied with you, and I thought that you were quite a\r\nfavorite in the establishment. How was it that you lost your place?"\r\n\r\n"I lost it through the meanness of Mr. Mahler."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Mahler, our Superintendent of public schools?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was through him that I lost my situation."\r\n\r\n"Why, what could you have done to offend him?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all; I never had an unpleasant word with him in my life."\r\n\r\n"Do explain yourself. I cannot see why he should have used any influence\r\nto deprive you of your situation."\r\n\r\n"He had it in his power to do me a mean, low-life trick, and he did it,\r\nand I hope to see the day when I will be even with him," said the lad,\r\nwith a flashing eye, while an angry flush mantled his cheek.\r\n\r\n"Do any of the family deal at Mr. Hazleton\'s store? Perhaps you gave\r\nsome of them offence through neglect or thoughtlessness in dealing with\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"It was nothing of the kind. Mr. Mahler knew me and my mother. He knew\r\nher because she taught under him, and of course saw me often enough to\r\nknow that I was her son, and so last week when he saw me in the store, I\r\nnoticed that he looked very closely at me, and that in a few moments\r\nafter he was in conversation with Mr. Hazleton. He asked him, \'if he\r\nemployed a nigger for a cashier?\' He replied, \'Of course not.\' \'Well,\'\r\nhe said, \'you have one now.\' After that they came down to the desk where\r\nI was casting up my accounts and Mr. Mahler asked, \'Is Mrs. Cooper your\r\nmother?\' I answered, \'yes sir.\' Of course I would not deny my mother.\r\n\'Isn\'t your name Charley?\'[8] and again I answered, yes; I could have\r\nresorted to concealment, but I would not lie for a piece of bread, and\r\nyet for mother\'s sake I sorely needed the place.\r\n\r\n"What did Mr. Hazleton say?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, only I thought he looked at me a little embarrassed, just as\r\nany half-decent man might when he was about to do a mean and cruel\r\nthing. But that afternoon I lost my place. Mr. Hazleton said to me when\r\nthe store was about to close, that he had no further use for me. Not\r\ndiscouraged, I found another place; but I believe that my evil genius\r\nfound me out and that through him I was again ousted from that situation\r\nand now I am at my wits end."\r\n\r\n"But, Charley, were you not sailing under false colors?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think so, Mr. Thompson. I saw in the window an advertisement,\r\n\'A boy wanted.\' They did not say what color the boy must be and I\r\napplied for the situation and did my work as faithfully as I knew how.\r\nMr. Hazleton seemed to be perfectly satisfied with my work and as he did\r\nnot seek to know the antecedents of my family I did not see fit to\r\nthrust them gratuitously upon him. You know the hard struggle my poor\r\nmother has had to get along, how the saloon has cursed and darkened our\r\nhome and I was glad to get anything to do by which I could honestly earn\r\na dollar and help her keep the wolf from the door, and I tried to do my\r\nlevel best, but it made no difference; as soon as it was known that I\r\nhad Negro blood in my veins door after door was closed against me; not\r\nthat I was not honest, industrious, obliging and steady, but simply\r\nbecause of the blood in my veins."\r\n\r\n"I admit," said Mr. Thomas, trying to repress his indignation and speak\r\ncalmly, "that it was a hard thing to be treated so for a cause over\r\nwhich you had not the least control, but, Charley, you must try to pick\r\nup courage."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it seems to me that my courage has all oozed out. I think that I\r\nwill go away; maybe I can find work somewhere else. Had I been a convict\r\nfrom a prison there are Christian women here who would have been glad to\r\nhave reached me out a helping hand and hailed my return to a life of\r\nhonest industry as a blessed crowning of their labors of love; while I,\r\nwho am neither a pauper nor felon, am turned from place after place\r\nbecause I belong to a race on whom Christendom bestowed the curse of\r\nslavery and under whose shadow has flourished Christless and inhuman\r\ncaste prejudice. So I think that I had better go and start life afresh."\r\n\r\n"No, Charley, don\'t go away. I know you could pass as a white man; but,\r\nCharley, don\'t you know that to do so you must separate from your\r\nkindred and virtually ignore your mother? A mother, who, for your sake,\r\nwould, I believe, take blood from every vein and strength from every\r\nnerve if it were necessary. If you pass into the white basis your mother\r\ncan never be a guest in your home without betraying your origin; you\r\ncannot visit her openly and crown her with the respect she so well\r\ndeserves without divulging the secret of your birth; and Charley, by\r\ndoing so I do not think it possible that however rich or strong or\r\ninfluential you may be as a white man, that you can be as noble and as\r\ntrue a man as you will be if you stand in your lot without compromise or\r\nconcealment, and feel that the feebler your mother\'s race is the closer\r\nyou will cling to it. Charley, you have lately joined the church; your\r\nmission in the world is not to seek to be rich and strong, but because\r\nthere is so much sin and misery in the world by it is to clasp the hand\r\nof Christ through faith and try to make the world better by your\r\ninfluence and gladder and brighter by your presence."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Thomas I try to be, and I hope I am a Christian, but if these\r\nprejudices are consistent with Christianity then I must confess that I\r\ndo not understand it, and if it is I do not want it. Are these people\r\nChristians who open the doors of charitable institutions to sinners who\r\nare white and close them against the same class who are black? I do not\r\ncall such people good patriots, let alone clear-sighted Christians. Why,\r\nthey act as if God had done wrong in making a man black, and that they\r\nhave never forgiven him and had become reconciled to the workmanship of\r\nhis hands."\r\n\r\n"Charley, you are excited just now, and I think that you are making the\r\nsame mistake that better educated men than you have done. You are\r\nputting Christianity and its abuses together. I do think, notwithstanding\r\nall its perversions, and all the rubbish which has gathered around its\r\nsimplicity and beauty, that Christianity is the world\'s best religion.\r\nI know that Christ has been wounded in what should have been the house\r\nof his friends; that the banner of his religion which is broad enough\r\nto float over the wide world with all its sin and misery, has been\r\ndrenched with the blood of persecution, trampled in the mire of slavery\r\nand stained by the dust of caste proscription; but I believe that men\r\nare beginning more fully to comprehend the claims of the gospel of\r\nJesus Christ. I am not afraid of what men call infidelity. I hold the\r\nfaith which I profess, to be too true, too sacred and precious to be\r\ndisturbed by every wave of wind and doubt. Amid all the religious\r\nupheavals of the Nineteenth Century, I believe God is at the helm, that\r\nthere are petrifactions of creed and dogma that are to [be] broken up,\r\nnot by mere intellectual speculations, but by the greater solvent of\r\nthe constraining love of Christ, and it is for this that I am praying,\r\nlonging and waiting. Let schoolmen dispute and contend, the faith for\r\nwhich I most ardently long and earnestly contend, is a faith which works\r\nby love and purifies the soul."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Thomas, I believe that there is something real about your religion,\r\nbut some of these white Christians do puzzle me awfully. Oh, I think\r\nthat I will go. I am sick and tired of the place. Everything seems to be\r\nagainst me."\r\n\r\n"No, Charley; stay for your mother\'s sake. I know a noble and generous\r\nman who is brave enough to face a vitiated public opinion, and rich\r\nenough to afford himself the luxury of a good conscience. I shall tell\r\nhim your story and try to interest him in your behalf. Will you stay?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly will if he will give me any chance to get my living and\r\nhelp my mother."\r\n\r\n"It has been said that everything has two handles, and if you take it by\r\nthe wrong handle it will be too hard to hold."\r\n\r\n"I should like to know which is the right handle to this prejudice\r\nagainst color."\r\n\r\n"I do not think that there is prejudice against color in this country."\r\n\r\n"No prejudice against color!" said Charley Cooper,[9] opening his eyes\r\nwith sudden wonder. "What was it that dogged my steps and shut door\r\nafter door against me? Wasn\'t that prejudice against color?"\r\n\r\n"Whose color, Charley? Surely not yours, for you are whiter than several\r\nof Mr. Hazleton\'s clerks. Do you see in your case it was not prejudice\r\nagainst color?"\r\n\r\n"What was it, then?"\r\n\r\n"It was the information that you were connected by blood with a once\r\nenslaved and despised people on whom society had placed its ban, and to\r\nwhom slavery and a low social condition had given a heritage of scorn,\r\nand as soon as he found out that you were connected with that race, he\r\nhad neither the manliness nor the moral courage to say, the boy is\r\ncapable and efficient. I see no cause why he should be dismissed for the\r\ncrimes of his white ancestors. I heard an eminent speaker once say that\r\nsome people would sing, \'I can smile at Satan\'s rage, and face a\r\nfrowning world,\' when they hadn\'t courage enough to face their next door\r\nneighbor on a moral question."\r\n\r\n"I think that must be the case with Mr. Hazleton."\r\n\r\n"I once used to despise such men. I have since learned to pity them."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what you find to pity in Mr. Hazleton, unless it is his\r\nmeanness."\r\n\r\n"Well, I pity him for that. I think there never was slave more cowed\r\nunder the whip of his master than he is under the lash of public\r\nopinion. The Negro was not the only one whom slavery subdued to the\r\npliancy of submission. Men fettered the slave and cramped their own\r\nsouls, denied him knowledge and then darkened their own spiritual\r\ninsight, and the Negro, poor and despised as he was, laid his hands upon\r\nAmerican civilization and has helped to mould its character. It is God\'s\r\nlaw. As ye sow, so shall ye reap, and men cannot sow avarice and\r\noppression without reaping the harvest of retribution. It is a dangerous\r\nthing to gather\r\n\r\n  The flowers of sin that blossom\r\n    Around the borders of hell."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n"I never want to go to that school again," said Annette entering Mrs.\r\nLasette\'s sitting room, throwing down her books on the table and looking\r\nas if she were ready to burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter now, my dear child? You seem to be all out of\r\nsorts."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had a fuss with that Mary Joseph."\r\n\r\n"Mary Joseph, the saloon-keeper\'s daughter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"How did it happen?"\r\n\r\n"Yesterday in changing seats, the teacher put us together according to\r\nthe first letter in our last names. You know that I, comes next to J;\r\nbut there wasn\'t a girl in the room whose name begins with I, and so as\r\nJ comes next, she put Mary Joseph and myself together."\r\n\r\n"Ireland and Africa, and they were not ready for annexation?"\r\n\r\n"No, and never will be, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Never is a long day, Annette, but go on with your story."\r\n\r\n"Well, after the teacher put her in the seat next to me she began to\r\nwriggle and squirm and I asked her if anything was biting her, because\r\nif there was, I did not want it to get on me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Annette, what a girl you are; why did you notice her? What did she\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\n"She said if there was, it must have got there since the teacher put\r\nher on that seat, and it must have come from me."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mary Joseph knows how to scratch as well as you do."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is a real scratch cat."\r\n\r\n"And what are you, my dear; a pattern saint?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Annette, as the ruefulness of her face relaxed into a smile,\r\n"but that isn\'t all; when I went to eat my lunch, she said she wasn\'t\r\nused to eating with niggers. Then I asked her if her mother didn\'t eat\r\nwith the pigs in the old country, and she said that she would rather eat\r\nwith them than to eat with me, and then she called me a nigger and I\r\ncalled her a poor white mick."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Annette, I am so sorry; I am afraid that trouble may come out of\r\nthis fuss, and then it is so wrong and unlady-like for you to be\r\nquarrelling that way. Do you know how old you are?"\r\n\r\n"I am almost fourteen years old."\r\n\r\n"Where was the teacher all this time? Did she know anything about it?"\r\n\r\n"No; she was out of the room part of the time, but I don\'t think she\r\nlikes colored people, because last week when Joe Smith was cutting up in\r\nschool, she made him get up and sit alongside of me to punish him."\r\n\r\n"She should not have done so, but I don\'t suppose she thought for one\r\nmoment how it looked."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, but when I told grandma about it, Mrs. Larkins was in the\r\nroom, and she said if she had done a child of hers so, she would have\r\ngone there and sauced her head off; but grandma said that she would not\r\nnotice it; that the easiest way is the best."\r\n\r\n"I think that your grandmother was right; but what did Joe say?"\r\n\r\nHe said that the teacher didn\'t spite him; that he would as lieve sit by\r\nme as any girl in school, and that he liked girls."\r\n\r\n"A little scamp."\r\n\r\n"He says he likes girls because they are so jolly."\r\n\r\n"But tell me all about Mary Joseph."\r\n\r\n"Well, a mean old thing, she went and told her horrid old father, and\r\njust as I was coming along he took hold of my arm and said he had heard\r\nthat I had called his daughter, Miss Mary Joseph, a poor white mick and\r\nthat if I did it again he would give me a good thrashing, and that for\r\ntwo pins he would do it then."\r\n\r\n"What next?"\r\n\r\n"I guess I felt like Mrs. Larkins does when she says her Guinea gets up.\r\nMy Guinea was up but I was afraid to show it. Oh, but I do hate these\r\nIrish. I don\'t like them for anything. Grandmother says that an Irishman\r\nis only a negro turned wrong side out, and I told her so yesterday\r\nmorning when she was fussing with me."\r\n\r\n"Say, rather, when we were fussing together; I don\'t think the fault was\r\nall on her side."\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Lasette, she had no business calling me a nigger."\r\n\r\n"Of course not; but would you have liked it [any] better if she had\r\ncalled you a negro?"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t want her to call me anything of the kind, neither negro nor\r\nnigger. She shan\'t even call me black."\r\n\r\n"But, Annette, are you not black?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if I am, she shan\'t call me so."\r\n\r\n"But suppose you were to say to Miss Joseph, \'How white your face is,\'\r\ndo you suppose she would get angry because you said that she looked\r\nwhite?"\r\n\r\n"No, of course not."\r\n\r\n"But suppose you met her hurrying to school, and you said to her, how\r\nred and rosy you look this morning, would that make her angry?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose that it would."\r\n\r\n"But suppose she would say to you, \'Annette, how black your face is this\r\nmorning,\' how would you feel?"\r\n\r\n"I should feel like slapping her."\r\n\r\n"Why so; do you think because Miss Joseph----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call her Miss, she is so mean and hateful."\r\n\r\n"But that don\'t hinder her from being Miss Joseph; If she is rude and\r\ncoarse, that is no reason why I should not have good manners."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Lasette you are too sweet for anything. I wish I was like\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Never mind my sweetness; that is not to the point. Will you listen to\r\nme, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I will. I could listen to you all night."\r\n\r\n"Well, if it were not for signs there\'s no mistaking I should think you\r\nhad a lot of Irish blood in your veins, and had kissed the blarney\r\nstone."\r\n\r\n"No I haven\'t and if I had I would try to let----"\r\n\r\n"Hush, my child; how you do rattle on. Do you think because Miss Joseph\r\nis white that she is any better than you are."\r\n\r\n"No, of course not."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you think that she can see and hear a little better than you\r\ncan?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no; what makes you ask such a funny question?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, just answer me a few more questions. Don\'t you think if you\r\nand she had got to fighting that she would have whipped you because she\r\nis white?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course not. Didn\'t she try to get the ruler out of my hand and\r\ndidn\'t because I was stronger."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you think she is smarter than you are and gets her lessons\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"Now you are shouting."\r\n\r\n"Why, Annette, where in the world did you get that slang?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Mrs. Lasette, I hear the boys saying it in the street, and the\r\ngirls in Tennis Court all say it, too. Is there any harm in it?"\r\n\r\n"It is slang, my child, and a young lady should never use slang. Don\'t\r\nuse it in private and you will not be apt to use it in public. However\r\nhumble or poor a person may be, there is no use in being coarse and\r\nunrefined."\r\n\r\n"But what harm is there in it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that there is any, but I don\'t think it nice for young\r\nladies to pick up all sorts of phrases in the street and bring them into\r\nthe home. The words may be innocent in themselves, but they may not have\r\nthe best associations, and it is safer not to use them. But let us\r\nreturn to Miss Joseph. You do not think that she can see or hear any\r\nbetter than you can, learn her lessons any quicker than you can, and\r\nwhen it comes to a trial of strength that she is stronger than you are,\r\nnow let me ask you one more question. Who made Miss Joseph?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the Lord, of course."\r\n\r\n"And who made you?"\r\n\r\n"He made me, too."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure that you did not make yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course not," said Annette with an accent of wonder in her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Does God ever make any mistakes?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no!"\r\n\r\n"Then if any one calls you black, why should you get angry? You say it\r\nwould not make Miss Joseph angry to say she looked white, or red and\r\nrosy."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; I know I don\'t like it and it makes me mad."\r\n\r\n"Now, let me explain the reason why it makes you angry to be called\r\nblack. Suppose I were to burn my hand in that stove, what would I have\r\non my hand?"\r\n\r\n"A sore place."\r\n\r\n"If it were your hand, what would you do?"\r\n\r\n"I would put something on it, wrap it up to keep from getting cold into\r\nit and try to get it well as soon as I could."\r\n\r\n"Well, that would be a very sensible way of dealing with it. In this\r\ncountry, Annette, color has been made a sore place; it has been\r\nassociated with slavery, poverty and ignorance. You cannot change your\r\ncolor, but you can try to change the association connected with our\r\ncomplexions. Did slavery force a man to be servile and submissive? Learn\r\nto hold up your head and respect yourself. Don\'t notice Mary Joseph\'s\r\ntaunts; if she says things to tease you don\'t you let her see that she\r\nhas succeeded. Learn to act as if you realized that you were born into\r\nthis world the child of the Ruler of the universe, that this is his\r\nworld and that you have as much right in it as she has. I think it was\r\nGilbert Haven, a Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, a man for\r\nwhose tombstone I do not think America has any marble too white or any\r\nlaurel too green, who saw on his travels a statue of Cleopatra, which\r\nsuggested to him this thought, \'I am black, but comely, the sun has\r\nlooked down upon me, but I will make you who despise me feel that I am\r\nyour superior,\' and, Annette, I want you to be so noble, true and pure\r\nthat if everybody should hate you, that no one could despise you. No,\r\nAnnette, if Miss Joseph ever attempts to quarrel with you don\'t put\r\nyourself on the same level by quarreling with her. I knew her parents\r\nwhen they were very poor; when a half dozen of them slept in one room.\r\nHe has made money by selling liquor; he is now doing business in one of\r\nthe most valuable pieces of property I see in East L street. He has been\r\na curse, and his saloon a nuisance in that street. He has gone up in\r\nproperty and even political influence, but oh, how many poor souls have\r\ngone down, slain by strong drink and debauchery."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue to his word, Mr. Thomas applied to Mr. Hastings, the merchant, of\r\nwhom he had spoken to his young friend. He went to his counting-room and\r\nasked for a private interview, which was readily granted. They had\r\nkindred intellectual and literary tastes and this established between\r\nthem a free masonry of mind which took no account of racial differences.\r\n\r\n"I have a favor to ask," said Mr. Thomas, "can you spare me a few\r\nmoments?"\r\n\r\n"I am at your service," Mr. Hasting replied, "what can I do for you?"\r\n\r\n"I have," he said, "a young friend who is honest and industrious and\r\ncompetent to fill the place of clerk or cashier in your store. He has\r\nbeen a cashier for Hazleton & Co., and while there gave entire\r\nsatisfaction."\r\n\r\n"Why did he leave?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot say, because he was guilty of a skin not colored like your\r\nown, but because a report was brought to Mr. Hazleton that he had Negro\r\nblood in his veins."\r\n\r\n"And what then?"\r\n\r\n"He summarily dismissed him."\r\n\r\n"What a shame!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was a shame, but this pride of caste dwarfs men\'s moral\r\nperception so that it prepares them to do a number of contemptible\r\nthings which, under other circumstances, they would scorn to do."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is so, and I am sorry to see it."\r\n\r\n"There are men, Mr. Hastings, who would grow hotly indignant if you\r\nwould say that they are not gentlemen who would treat a Negro in a\r\nmanner which would not be recognized as fair, even by ruffians of the\r\nring, for, I believe, it is their code of honor not to strike a man when\r\nhe is down; but with respect to the colored man, it seems to be a\r\nsettled policy with some not only to push him down, but to strike him\r\nwhen he is down. But I must go; I came to ask a favor and it is not\r\nright to trespass on your time."\r\n\r\n"No; sit still. I have a little leisure I can give you. My fall trade\r\nhas not opened yet and I am not busy. I see and deplore these things of\r\nwhich you complain, but what can be done to help it?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hastings, you see them, and I feel them, and I fear that I am\r\ngrowing morbid over them, and not only myself, but other educated men\r\nof my race, and that, I think, is a thing to be deprecated. Between the\r\nwhite people and the colored people of this country there is a unanimity\r\nof interest and I know that our interests and duties all lie in one\r\ndirection. Can men corrupt and intimidate voters in the South without a\r\nreflex influence being felt in the North? Is not the depression of labor\r\nin the South a matter of interest to the North? You may protect yourself\r\nfrom what you call the pauper of Europe, but you will not be equally\r\nable to defend yourself from the depressed laborer of the new South, and\r\nas an American citizen, I dread any turn of the screw which will lower\r\nthe rate of wages here; and I like to feel as an American citizen that\r\nwhatever concerns the nation concerns me. But I feel that this prejudice\r\nagainst my race compresses my soul, narrows my political horizon and\r\nmakes me feel that I am an alien in the land of my birth. It meets me in\r\nthe church, it confronts me in business and I feel its influence in\r\nalmost every avenue of my life."\r\n\r\n"I wish, Mr. Thomas, that some of the men who are writing and talking\r\nabout the Negro problem would only come in contact with the thoughtful\r\nmen of your race. I think it would greatly modify their views."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you know us as your servants. The law takes cognizance of our\r\ncrimes. Your charitable institutions of our poverty, but what do any of\r\nyou know of our best and most thoughtful men and women? When we write\r\nhow many of you ever read our books and papers or give yourselves any\r\ntrouble to come near us as friends and help us? Even some of your\r\nprofessed Christians are trying to set us apart as if we were social\r\nlepers."\r\n\r\n"You draw a dark picture. I confess that I feel pained at the condition\r\nof affairs in the South, but what can we do in the South?"\r\n\r\n"Set the South a better example. But I am hindering you in your\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I want to see things from the same standpoint that you do."\r\n\r\n"Put yourself then in my place. You start both North and South from the\r\npremise that we are an inferior race and as such you have treated us.\r\nHas not the consensus of public opinion said for ages, \'No valor redeems\r\nour race, no social advancement nor individual development wipes off the\r\nban which clings to us\'; that our place is on the lowest round of the\r\nsocial ladder; that at least, in part of the country we are too low for\r\nthe equal administrations of religion and the same dispensations of\r\ncharity and a fair chance in the race of life?"\r\n\r\n"You bring a heavy verdict against us. I hardly think that it can be\r\nsustained. Whatever our motives may have been, we have been able to\r\neffect in a few years a wonderful change in the condition of the Negro.\r\nHe has freedom and enfranchisement and with these two great rights he\r\nmust work out his social redemption and political solution. If his means\r\nof education have been limited, a better day is dawning upon him. Doors\r\nonce closed against him in the South are now freely opened to him, and I\r\ndo not think that there ever was a people who freed their slaves who\r\nhave given as much for their education as we have, and my only hope is\r\nthat the moral life of the race will keep pace with its intellectual\r\ngrowth. You tell me to put myself in your place. I think if I were a\r\ncolored young man that I would develop every faculty and use every power\r\nwhich God had given me for the improvement and development of my race.\r\nAnd who among us would be so blind and foolish as to attempt to keep\r\ndown an enlightened people who were determined to rise in the scale of\r\ncharacter and condition? No, Mr. Thomas, while you blame us for our\r\ntransgressions and shortcomings, do not fail to do all you can to rouse\r\nup all the latent energies of your young men to do their part worthily\r\nas American citizens and to add their quota to the strength and progress\r\nof the nation."\r\n\r\n"I am conscious of the truth and pertinence of your remarks, but bear\r\nwith me just a few moments while I give an illustration of what I mean."\r\n\r\n"Speak on, I am all attention. The subject you bring before me is of\r\ntoo vital importance to be constantly ignored."\r\n\r\n"I have a friend who is presiding elder in the A.M.E. Church and his\r\nwife, I think, is capable of being a social and intellectual accession\r\nin any neighborhood in which they might live. He rented a house in the\r\ncity of L. and being of a fair complexion I suppose the lessee rented to\r\nhim without having a suspicion of his race connection. When it was\r\nascertained that he and his family were colored, he was ordered to\r\nleave, and this man, holding among the ministers of that city the\r\nposition of ambassador for Christ, was ordered out of the house on\r\naccount of the complexion of his family. Was there not a screw loose in\r\nthe religious sentiment of that city which made such an act possible? A\r\nfriend of mine who does mission work in your city, some time since,\r\nfound a young woman in the slums and applied at the door of a midnight\r\nmission for fallen women, and asked if colored girls could be received,\r\nand was curtly answered, \'no.\' For her in that mission there was no room.\r\nThe love of Christ constrained no hand to strive to rescue her from the\r\ndepths of degradation. The poor thing went from bad to worse till at\r\nlast, wrecked and blighted, she went down to an early grave the victim\r\nof strong drink. That same lady found on her mission a white girl;\r\nseeing a human soul adrift, regardless of color, she went, in company\r\nwith some others, to that same mission with the poor castaway; to her\r\nthe door was opened without delay and ready admittance granted. But I\r\nmight go on reciting such instances until you would be weary of hearing\r\nand I of relating them; but I appeal to you as a patriot and Christian,\r\nis it not fearfully unwise to keep alive in freedom the old animosities\r\nof slavery? To-day the Negro shares citizenship with you. He is not\r\narraying himself against your social order; his hands are not dripping\r\nwith dynamite, nor is he waving in your face the crimson banners of\r\nanarchy, but he is increasing in numbers and growing in intelligence,\r\nand is it not madness and folly to subject him to social and public\r\ninequalities, which are calculated to form and keep alive a hatred of\r\nrace as a reaction against pride of caste?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Thomas, you have given me a new view of the matter. To tell you the\r\ntruth, we have so long looked upon the colored man as a pliable and\r\nsubmissive being that we have never learned to look at any hatred on his\r\npart as an element of danger, and yet I should be sorry to know that by\r\nour Southern supineness we were thoughtlessly helping create a black\r\nIreland in our Gulf States, that in case the fires of anarchy should\r\never sweep through our land, that a discontented and disaffected people\r\nin our midst might be as so much fuel to fire."\r\n\r\n"But really I have been forgetting my errand. Have you any opening in\r\nyour store for my young friend?"\r\n\r\n"I have only one vacancy, and that is the place of a utility man."\r\n\r\n"What are the duties of that position?"\r\n\r\n"Almost anything that comes to hand; tying up bundles, looking after the\r\nmails, scattering advertisements. A factotum whose work lies here, there\r\nand everywhere."\r\n\r\n"I am confident that he will accept the situation and render you\r\nfaithful service."\r\n\r\n"Well, then send him around tomorrow and if there is anything in him I\r\nmay be able to do better by him when the fall trade opens."\r\n\r\nAnd so Charley Cooper was fortunate enough in his hour of perplexity to\r\nfind a helping hand to tide him over a difficult passage in his life.\r\nGratefully and faithfully did he serve Mr. Hastings, who never regretted\r\nthe hour when he gave the struggling boy such timely assistance. The\r\ndiscipline of the life through which he was passing as the main stay of\r\nhis mother, matured his mind and imparted to it a thoughtfulness past\r\nhis years. Instead of wasting his time in idle and pernicious pleasure,\r\nhe learned how to use his surplus dollar and how to spend his leisure\r\nhours, and this knowledge told upon his life and character. He was not\r\nvery popular in society. Young men with cigars in their mouths and the\r\nperfume of liquor on their breaths, shrugged their shoulders and called\r\nhim a milksop because he preferred the church and Sunday school to the\r\nliquor saloon and gambling dens. The society of P. was cut up and\r\ndivided into little sets and coteries; there was an amount of\r\nintelligence among them, but it ran in narrow grooves and scarcely\r\none[10] intellect seemed to tower above the other, and if it did, no\r\npeople knew better how to ignore a rising mind than the society people\r\nof A.P. If the literary aspirant did not happen to be of their set. As\r\nto talent, many of them were pleasant and brilliant conversationalists,\r\nbut in the world of letters scarcely any of them were known or\r\nrecognized outside of their set. They had leisure, a little money and\r\nsome ability, but they lacked the perseverance and self-denial\r\nnecessary to enable them to add to the great resources of natural\r\nthought. They had narrowed their minds to the dimensions of their set\r\nand were unprepared to take expansive[11] views of life and duty. They\r\ntook life as a holiday and the lack of noble purposes and high and holy\r\naims left its impress upon their souls and deprived them of that joy and\r\nstrength which should have crowned their existence and given to their\r\nlives its "highest excellence and beauty."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years have elapsed since we left Annette recounting her school\r\ngrievances to Mrs. Lasette. She has begun to feel the social contempt\r\nwhich society has heaped upon the colored people, but she has determined\r\nnot to succumb to it. There is force in the character of that fiery,\r\nimpetuous and impulsive girl, and her school experience is bringing it\r\nout. She has been bending all her mental energies to compete for the\r\nhighest prize at the commencement of her school, from which she expects\r\nto graduate in a few weeks. The treatment of the saloon-keeper\'s\r\ndaughter, and that of other girls of her ilk, has stung her into\r\nstrength. She feels that however despised her people may be, that a\r\nmonopoly of brains has not been given to the white race. Mr. Thomas has\r\nencouraged her efforts, and taught her to believe that not only is her\r\nown honor at stake as a student, but that as a representative of her\r\nbranch of the human race, she is on the eve of winning, or losing, not\r\nonly for herself, but for others. This view of the matter increases her\r\ndetermination and rouses up all the latent energies of her nature, and\r\nshe labors day and night to be a living argument of the capability in\r\nher race. For other girls who will graduate in that school, there will\r\nbe open doors, and unclosed avenues, while she knows that the color of\r\nher skin will bar against her the doors of workshops, factories and\r\nschool rooms, and yet Mr. Thomas, knowing all the discouragements around\r\nher path, has done what he could to keep her interest in her studies\r\nfrom flagging. He knows that she has fine abilities, but that they must\r\nbe disciplined by trial and endeavor before her life can be rounded by\r\nsuccess and triumph. He has seen several of her early attempts at\r\nversification; pleased and even delighted with them, he has shown them\r\nto a few of his most intellectual friends. Eager and earnest for the\r\nelevation of the colored people, he has been pained at the coldness with\r\nwhich they have been received.\r\n\r\n"I do not call that poetry," said one of the most intelligent women of\r\nA.P.\r\n\r\n"Neither do I see anything remarkable about her," said another.\r\n\r\n"I did not," said Mr. Thomas, "bring you the effusions of an\r\nacknowledged poet, but I think that the girl has fine ability, which\r\nneeds encouragement and recognition."\r\n\r\nBut his friends could not see it; they were very charry of their\r\nadmiration, lest their judgment should be found at fault, and then it\r\nwas so much easier to criticise than it was to heartily admire; and they\r\nknew it seemed safer to show their superior intelligence by dwelling on\r\nthe defects, which would necessarily have an amount of crudeness in them\r\nthan to look beneath the defects for the suggestions of beauty, strength\r\nand grace which Mr. Thomas saw in these unripe, but promising effusions.\r\nIt seemed perfectly absurd with the surroundings of Tennis Court to\r\nexpect anything grand or beautiful [to] develop in its midst; but with\r\nAnnette, poetry was a passion born in her soul, and it was as natural\r\nfor her to speak in tropes and figures as it was for others to talk in\r\nplain, common prose. Mr. Thomas called her "our inveterate poet," and\r\nencouraged her, but the literary aspirants took scarcely any interest in\r\nthe girl whom they left to struggle on as best she might. In her own\r\nhome she was doomed to meet with lack of encouragement and appreciation\r\nfrom her relatives and grandmother\'s friends. One day her aunt, Eliza\r\nHanson, was spending the day with her mother, and Annette showed her\r\nsome of her verses and said to her, "that is one of my best pieces."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you have a number of best pieces," said her aunt, carelessly. "Can\r\nyou cook a beefsteak?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I could if I tried."\r\n\r\n"Well, you had better try than to be trying to string verses together.\r\nYou seem to think that there must be something very great about you. I\r\nknow where you want to get. You want to get among the upper tens, but\r\nyou haven\'t got style enough about you for that."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I tell her," said her grandmother. "She\'s got too many\r\nairs for a girl in her condition. She talks about writing a book, and\r\nshe is always trying to make up what she calls poetry. I expect that she\r\nwill go crazy some of these days. She is all the time talking to\r\nherself, and I just think it is a sin for her to be so much taken up\r\nwith her poetry."\r\n\r\n"You had better put her to work; had she not better go out to service?"\r\n\r\n"No, I am going to let her graduate first."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of it? When she\'s through, if she wants to teach, she\r\nwill have to go away."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know that, but Mrs. Lasette has persuaded me to let Annette\r\ngraduate, and I have promised that I would do so, and besides I think to\r\ntake Annette from school just now would almost break her heart."\r\n\r\n"Well, mother, that is just like you; you will work yourself almost to\r\ndeath to keep Annette in school, and when she is through what good will\r\nit do her?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe something will turn up that you don\'t see just now. When a good\r\nthing turns up if a person ain\'t ready for it they can\'t take hold of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope a good husband will turn up for my Alice."\r\n\r\n"But maybe the good husband won\'t turn up for Annette."\r\n\r\n"That is well said, for they tell me that Annette is not very popular,\r\nand that some of the girls are all the time making fun of her."\r\n\r\n"Well, they had better make fun of themselves and their own bad manners.\r\nAnnette is poor and has no father to stand by her, and I cannot\r\nentertain like some of their parents can, but Annette, with all her\r\nfaults, is as good as any of them. Talk about the prejudice of the white\r\npeople, I think there is just as much prejudice among some colored as\r\nthere is among them, only we do not get the same chance to show it; we\r\nare most too mixed up and dependent on one another for that." Just then\r\nMrs. Lasette entered the room and Mrs. Hanson, addressing her, said, "We\r\nwere just discussing Annette\'s prospects. Mother wants to keep Annette\r\nat school till she graduates, but I think she knows enough now to teach\r\na country school and it is no use for mother to be working as she does\r\nto keep Annette in school for the sake of letting her graduate. There\r\nare lots of girls in A.P. better off than she who have never graduated,\r\nand I don\'t see that mother can afford to keep Annette at school any\r\nlonger."\r\n\r\n"But, Eliza, Annette is company for me and she does help about the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think much of her help; always when I come home she has a book\r\nstuck under her nose."\r\n\r\n"Annette," said Mrs. Lasette, "is a favorite of mine; I have always a\r\nwarm place in my heart for her, and I really want to see the child do\r\nwell. In my judgment I do not think it advisable to take her from school\r\nbefore she graduates. If Annette were indifferent about her lessons and\r\nshowed no aptitude for improvement I should say as she does not\r\nappreciate education enough to study diligently and has not aspiration\r\nenough to keep up with her class, find out what she is best fitted for\r\nand let her be instructed in that calling for which she is best\r\nadapted."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Mrs. Hanson, "you all do wrong in puffing up Annette\r\nwith the idea that she is something extra. You think, Mrs. Lasette, that\r\nthere is something wonderful about Annette, but I can\'t see it, and I\r\nhear a lot of people say she hasn\'t got good sense."\r\n\r\n"They do not understand the child."\r\n\r\n"They all say that she is very odd and queer and often goes out into the\r\nstreet as if she never saw a looking glass. Why, Mrs. Miller\'s daughter\r\njust laughed till she was tired at the way Annette was dressed when she\r\nwent to call on an acquaintance of hers. Why, Annette just makes herself\r\na perfect laughing stock."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think Mary Miller might have found better employment than\r\nlaughing at her company."\r\n\r\n"Now, let me tell you, Mary Miller don\'t take her for company, and that\r\nvery evening Annette was at my house, just next door, and when Mary\r\nMiller went to church she never asked her to go along with her, although\r\nshe belongs to the same church."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to say it," said grandmother Harcourt, "but your Alice\r\nhardly ever comes to see Annette, and never asks her to go anywhere with\r\nher, but may be in the long run Annette will come out better than some\r\nwho now look down upon her. It is a long road that has no turn and\r\nAnnette is like a singed cat; she is better than she looks."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Mrs. Lasette, "while Annette is very bright and\r\nintelligent as a pupil, she has been rather slow in developing in some\r\nother directions. She lacks tact, is straightforward to bluntness and\r\nhas not any style about her and little or no idea of company manners,\r\nbut she is never coarse nor rude. I never knew her to read a book whose\r\nauthor I would blush to name, and I never heard her engage in any\r\nconversation I would shrink to hear repeated. I don\'t think there is a\r\ngirl of purer lips in A.P. than Annette, and I do not think your set, as\r\nyou call it, has such a monopoly of either virtue or intelligence that\r\nyou can afford to ridicule and depress any young soul who does not\r\nhappen to come up to your social standard. Where dress and style are\r\npassports Annette may be excluded, but where brain and character count\r\nAnnette will gain admittance. I fear," said Mrs. Lasette, rising to go,\r\n"that many a young girl has gone down in the very depths who might have\r\nbeen saved if motherly women, when they saw them unloved and lonely, had\r\nreached out to them a helping hand and encouraged them to live useful\r\nand good lives. We cry am I my sister\'s keeper? [I?] will not wipe the\r\nblood off our hands if through pride and selfishness we have stabbed by\r\nour neglect souls we should have helped by our kindness. I always feel\r\nfor young girls who are lonely and neglected in large cities and are in\r\ndanger of being ensnared by pretended sympathies and false friendship,\r\nand, to-day, no girl is more welcome at any social gathering than\r\nAnnette."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lasette," said Mrs. Hanson, "you are rich and you can do as you\r\nchoose in A.P. You can set the fashion."\r\n\r\n"No; I am not rich, but I hope that I will always be able to lend a\r\nhand to any lonely girl who is neglected, slighted and forgotten while\r\nshe is trying to do right, who comes within my reach while I live in\r\nA.P. Good morning."\r\n\r\n"Annette," said Mrs. Hanson,[12] "has a champion who will stand by her."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Harcourt,[13] "Anna is true as steel; the kind of woman\r\nyou can tie to. When my great trouble came, she was good as gold, and\r\nwhen my poor heart was almost breaking, she always had a kind word for\r\nme. I wish we had ten thousand like her."\r\n\r\n"Well, mother, I must go, but if Annette does graduate don\'t let her go\r\non the stage looking like a fright. General H\'s daughter has a beautiful\r\nnew silk dress and a lovely hat which she got just a few weeks before\r\nher mother\'s death; as she has gone in black she wants to sell it, and\r\nif you say so, and will pay for it on installments, I can get if for\r\nAnnette, and I think with a little alteration it would be splendid for\r\nher graduation dress."\r\n\r\n"No; Eliza, I can\'t afford it."\r\n\r\n"Why, mother, Annette will need something nice for the occasion, and it\r\nwill not cost any more than what you intend to pay for her dress and\r\nhat. Why not take them?"\r\n\r\n"Because Annette is not able to wear them. Suppose she had that one fine\r\ndress and hat, would she not want more to match with them? I don\'t want\r\nher to learn to dress in a style that she cannot honestly afford. I\r\nthink this love of dress is the ruination of many a young girl. I think\r\nthis straining after fine things when you are not able to get them, is\r\nperfectly ridiculous. I believe in cutting your coat according to your\r\ncloth. I saw Mrs. Hempstead\'s daughter last Sunday dressed up in a\r\nhandsome light silk, and a beautiful spring hat, and if she or her\r\nmother would get sick to-morrow, they would, I suppose, soon be objects\r\nof public charity or dependent on her widowed sister, who is too proud\r\nto see her go to the poor house; and this is just the trouble with a lot\r\nof people; they not only have their own burdens to bear but somebody\r\nelse\'s. You may call me an old fogy, but I would rather live cheap and\r\ndress plain than shirk my burdens because I had wasted when they had\r\nsaved. You and John Hanson are both young and have got your health and\r\nstrength, and instead of buying sealskins, and velvets and furbelows,\r\nyou had better be laying up for a rainy day. You have no more need for a\r\nsealskin cloak than a cat has for a catechism. Now you do as you please,\r\nI have had my say."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been quite a length of time since we left Mr. Thomas and his\r\nyoung friend facing an uncertain future. Since then he has not only been\r\nsuccessful in building up a good business for himself, but in opening\r\nthe gates to others. His success has not inflated him with pride.\r\nNeither has he become self-abashed and isolated from others less\r\nfortunate, who need his counsel and sympathy. Generous and noble in his\r\ncharacter, he was conservative enough to cling to the good of the past\r\nand radical enough to give hospitality to every new idea which was\r\ncalculated to benefit and make life noble and better. Mr. Thomas, in\r\nlaying the foundation of his education, was thoughtful enough to enter\r\na manual labor school, where he had the double advantage of getting\r\nan education and learning a trade, through which he was enabled to\r\nrely on himself without asking aid from any one, which in itself was\r\nan education in manliness, self-respect and self-reliance, that he\r\ncould not have obtained had he been the protege of the wealthiest\r\nphilanthropist in the land. As he had fine mechanical skill and\r\ningenuity, he became an excellent carpenter. But it is one thing to have\r\na trade and another thing to have an opportunity to exercise that trade.\r\nIt was a time when a number of colored churches were being erected. To\r\nbuild large and even magnificent churches seemed to be a ruling passion\r\nwith the colored people. Their homes might be very humble, their walls\r\nbare of pictured grace, but by united efforts they could erect large and\r\nhandsome churches in which they had a common possession and it was one\r\nof the grand satisfactions of freedom that they were enabled to build\r\ntheir own churches and carry on their own business without being\r\ninterfered with, and overlooked by a class of white ecclesiastics whose\r\npresence was a reminder of their implied inferiority. The church of\r\nwhich Mr. Thomas was a member was about to erect a costly edifice. The\r\ntrustees would probably have willingly put the work in the hands of a\r\ncolored man, had there been a sufficient number to have done the work,\r\nbut they did not seem to remember that white prejudice had barred the\r\nNorthern workshops against the colored man, that slavery, by degrading\r\nand monopolizing labor had been the means of educating colored men in\r\nthe South to be good mechanics, and that a little pains and search on\r\ntheir part might have brought to light colored carpenters in the South\r\nwho would have done the work as efficiently as those whom they employed,\r\nbut as the trustees were not very farsighted men, they did the most\r\navailable thing that came to hand; they employed a white man. Mr.\r\nThomas\' pastor applied to the master builder for a place for his\r\nparishioner.\r\n\r\n"Can you give employment to one of my members, on our church?" Rev.\r\nMr. Lomax asked the master builder.\r\n\r\n"I would willingly do so, but I can not."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because my men would all rise up against it. Now, for my part, I have\r\nno prejudice against your parishioner, but my men will not work with a\r\ncolored man. I would let them all go if I could get enough colored men\r\nto suit me just as well, but such is the condition of the labor market,\r\nthat a man must either submit to a number of unpalatable things or run\r\nthe risk of a strike and being boycotted. I think some of these men who\r\nwant so much liberty for themselves have very little idea of it for\r\nother people."\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation the minister told Mr. Thomas the result of his\r\ninterview with the master builder, and said,\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry; but it is as it is, and it can\'t be any better."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean by that that things are always going to remain as they\r\nare?"\r\n\r\n"I do not see any quick way out of it. This prejudice is the outgrowth\r\nof ages; it did not come in a day, nor do I expect that it will vanish\r\nin an hour."\r\n\r\n"Nor do I; but I do not think the best way for a people to mend their\r\npastures is to sit down and bewail their fate."\r\n\r\n"No; we must be up and going for ourselves. White people will----"\r\n\r\n"White people," exclaimed Mr. Thomas somewhat impatiently. "Is there not\r\na great deal of bosh in the estimate some of us have formed of white\r\npeople. We share a common human feeling, from which the same cause\r\nproduces the same effect. Why am I today a social Pariah, begging for\r\nwork, and refused situation after situation? My father is a wealthy\r\nSoutherner; he has several other sons who are inheritors of his name and\r\nheirs of his wealth. They are educated, cultured and occupy high social\r\npositions. Had I not as good a right to be well born as any of them? And\r\nyet, through my father\'s crime, I was doomed to the status of a slave\r\nwith its heritage of ignorance, poverty and social debasement. Talk of\r\nthe heathenism of Africa, of hostile tribes warring upon each other and\r\nselling the conquered foes into the hands of white men, but how much\r\nhigher in the scale of moral progression was the white man who doomed\r\nhis own child, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, to a life of\r\nslavery? The heathen could plead in his defence the fortunes of war, and\r\nthe hostility of an opposing tribe, but the white man who enslaved his\r\nchild warred upon his hapless offspring and wrote chattel upon his\r\ncondition when his hand was too feeble to hurl aside the accursed hand\r\nand recognize no other ownership but God. I once felt bitterly on this\r\nsubject, and although it is impossible for my father to make full\r\nreparation for the personal wrong inflicted on me, I owe him no grudge.\r\nHating is poor employment for any rational being, but I am not prepared\r\nto glorify him at the expense of my mother\'s race. She was faithful to\r\nme when he deserted me to a life of ignorance and poverty, and although\r\nthree-fourths of the blood in my veins belongs to my father\'s face, I\r\nfeel a kinship with my mother\'s people that I do not with his, and I\r\nwill defend that race from the aspersions of the meanest Negro hater in\r\nthe land. Heathenism and civilization live side by side on American\r\nsoil, but all the heathenism is not on the side of the Negro. Look at\r\nslavery and kukluxism with their meanness and crimes, mormonism with its\r\nvile abominations, lynch law with its burnings and hangings, our\r\nnational policy in regard to the Indians and Chinese."\r\n\r\n"I do not think," said the minister, "that there is another civilized\r\ncountry in the world where men are lynched for real or supposed crimes\r\noutside of America."\r\n\r\n"The Negro need not bow his head like a bulrush in the presence of a\r\nrace whose records are as stained by crime and dishonor as theirs. Let\r\nothers decry the Negro, and say hard things about him, I am not prepared\r\nto join in the chorus of depreciation."\r\n\r\nAfter parting with the minister, Mr. Thomas resolved, if pluck and\r\nenergy were of any avail, that he would leave no stone unturned in\r\nseeking employment. He searched the papers carefully for advertisements,\r\nwalked from one workshop to the other looking for work, and was\r\neventually met with a refusal which meant, no negro need apply. At last\r\none day when he had tried almost every workshop in the place, he entered\r\nthe establishment of Wm. C. Nell, an Englishman who had not been long\r\nenough in America to be fully saturated by its Christless and inhuman\r\nprejudices. He was willing to give Mr. Thomas work, and put tools in his\r\nhands, and while watching how deftly he handled them, he did not notice\r\nthe indignant scowls on the faces of his workmen, and their murmurs of\r\ndisapprobation as they uttered their dissatisfaction one to the other.\r\nAt length they took off their aprons, laid down their tools and asked to\r\nbe discharged from work.\r\n\r\n"Why, what does this mean?" asked the astounded Englishman.\r\n\r\n"It means that we will not work with a nigger."\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t understand? what is the matter with him?"\r\n\r\n"Why, there\'s nothing the matter, only he\'s a nigger, and we never put\r\nniggers on an equality with us, and we never will."\r\n\r\n"But I am a stranger in this country, and I don\'t understand you."\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'s a nigger, and we don\'t want niggers for nothing; would you\r\nhave your daughter marry a nigger?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, go back to your work; I never thought of such a thing. I think the\r\nNegro must be an unfortunate man, and I do not wish my daughter to marry\r\nany unfortunate man, but if you do not want to work with him I will put\r\nhim by himself; there is room enough on the premises; will that suit you\r\nany better?"\r\n\r\n"No; we won\'t work for a man who employs a nigger."\r\n\r\nThe builder bit his lip; he had come to America hearing that it was a\r\nland of liberty but he had found an undreamed of tyranny which had\r\nentered his workshop and controlled his choice of workmen, and as much\r\nas he deprecated the injustice, it was the dictum of a vitiated public\r\nopinion that his field of occupation should be closed against the Negro,\r\nand he felt that he was forced, either to give up his business or submit\r\nto the decree.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas then thought, "my money is vanishing, school rooms and\r\nworkshops are closed against me. I will not beg, and I can not resort to\r\nany questionable means for bread. I will now take any position or do any\r\nwork by which I can make an honest living." Just as he was looking\r\ngloomily at the future an old school mate laid his hand upon his\r\nshoulder and said, "how do you do, old fellow? I have not seen you for a\r\nweek of Sundays. What are you driving at now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing in particular. I am looking for work."\r\n\r\n"Well, now this is just the ticket. I have just returned from the\r\nPacific coast and while I was there I did splendidly; everything I\r\ntouched turned to gold, and now I have a good job on hand if you are not\r\ntoo squeamish to take it. I have just set up a tiptop restaurant and\r\nsaloon, and I have some of the best merchants of the city as my\r\ncustomers, and I want a first rate clerk. You were always good at\r\nfigures and if you will accept the place come with me right away. Since\r\nhigh license went into operation, I am making money hand over fist. It\r\nis just like the big fish eating up the little fish. I am doing a\r\nrushing business and I want you to do my clerking."\r\n\r\nThe first thought which rushed into Mr. Thomas\' mind was, "Is thy\r\nservant a dog that he should do this thing?" but he restrained his\r\nindignation and said,\r\n\r\n"No, Frank, I cannot accept your offer; I am a temperance man and a\r\nprohibitionist, and I would rather have my hands clean than to have them\r\nfoul."\r\n\r\n"You are a greater milksop than I gave you credit for. Here you are\r\nhunting work, and find door after door closed against you, not because\r\nyou are not but because you are colored, and here am I offering you easy\r\nemployment and good wages and you refuse them."\r\n\r\n"Frank," said Mr. Thomas, "I am a poor man, but I would rather rise up\r\nearly, and sit up late and eat the bread of carelessness, than to roll\r\nin wealth by keeping a liquor saloon, and I am determined that no\r\ndrunkard shall ever charge me with having helped drag him down to\r\nmisery, shame and death. No drunkard\'s wife shall ever lay the wreck of\r\nher home at my door."\r\n\r\n"My business," said Frank Miller, "is a legitimate one; there is money\r\nin it, and I am after that. If people will drink too much and make fools\r\nof themselves I can\'t help it; it is none of my business, and if I don\'t\r\nsell to them other people will. I don\'t think much of a man who does not\r\nknow how to govern himself, but it is no use arguing with you when you\r\nare once set in your ways; good morning."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a gala day in Tennis Court. Annette had passed a highly\r\nsuccessful examination, and was to graduate from the normal school, and\r\nas a matter of course, her neighbors wanted to hear Annette "speak her\r\npiece" as they called the commencement theme, and also to see how she\r\nwas going to behave before all "them people." They were, generally\r\nspeaking, too unaspiring to feel envious toward any one of their race\r\nwho excelled them intellectually, and so there was little or no jealousy\r\nof Annette in Tennis Court; in fact some of her neighbors felt a kind of\r\npride in the thought that Tennis Court would turn out a girl who could\r\nstand on the same platform and graduate alongside of some of their\r\nemployers\' daughters. If they could not stand there themselves they were\r\nproud that one of their race could.\r\n\r\n"I feel," said one, "like the boy when some one threatened to slap off\r\nhis face who said \'you can slap off my face, but I have a big brother\r\nand you can\'t slap off his face;\'" and strange as it may appear, Annette\r\nreceived more encouragement from a class of honest-hearted but ignorant\r\nand well meaning people who knew her, than she did from some of the most\r\ncultured and intelligent people of A.P. Nor was it very strange; they\r\nwere living too near the poverty, ignorance and social debasement of the\r\npast to have developed much race pride, and a glowing enthusiasm in its\r\nprogress and development. Although they were of African descent, they\r\nwere Americans whose thoughts were too much Americanized to be wholly\r\nfree from imbibing the social atmosphere with which they were in\r\nconstant contact in their sphere of enjoyments. The literature they read\r\nwas mostly from the hands of white men who would paint them in any\r\ncolors which suited their prejudices or predilections. The religious\r\nideas they had embraced came at first thought from the same sources,\r\nthough they may have undergone modifications in passing through their\r\nchannels of thought, and it must be a remarkable man or woman who thinks\r\nan age ahead of the generation in which his or her lot is cast, and who\r\nplans and works for the future on the basis of that clearer vision. Nor\r\nis it to be wondered at, if under the circumstances, some of the more\r\ncultured of A.P. thought it absurd to look for anything remarkable to\r\ncome out of the black Nazareth of Tennis court. Her neighbors had an\r\nidea that Annette was very smart; that she had a great "head piece," but\r\nunless she left A.P. to teach school elsewhere, they did not see what\r\ngood her education was going to do her. It wasn\'t going to put any meal\r\nin the barrel nor any potatoes in the bin. Even Mrs. Larkins relaxed her\r\nancient hostility to Annette and opened her heart to present her with a\r\nbasket of flowers. Annette within the last year had become very much\r\nchanged in her conduct and character. She had become friendly in her\r\nmanner and considerate in her behavior to Mrs. Larkins since she had\r\nentered the church, during a protracted meeting. Annette was rather\r\ncrude in her religious views but here again Mrs. Lasette became her\r\nfaithful friend and advisor. In dealing with a young convert she thought\r\nmore was needed than getting her into the church and making her feel\r\nthat the moment she rose from the altar with rejoicing on her lips, that\r\nshe was a full blown christian. That, to Mrs. Lasette was the initial\r\nstep in the narrow way left luminous by the bleeding feet of Christ, and\r\nwhat the young convert needed was to be taught how to walk worthy of her\r\nhigh calling, and to make her life a thing of usefulness and\r\nfaithfulness to God and man, a growth in grace and in the saving\r\nknowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Simply attired in a dress which Mrs.\r\nLasette thought fitted for the occasion, Annette took her seat quietly\r\non the platform and calmly waited till her turn came. Her subject was\r\nannounced: "The Mission of the Negro." It was a remarkable production\r\nfor a girl of her age. At first she portrayed an African family seated\r\nbeneath their bamboo huts and spreading palms; the light steps of the\r\nyoung men and maidens tripping to music, dance and song; their pastimes\r\nsuddenly broken upon by the tramp of the merchants of flesh and blood;\r\nthe capture of defenceless people suddenly surprised in the midst of\r\ntheir sports, the cries of distress, the crackling of flames, the cruel\r\noaths of reckless men, eager for gold though they coined it from tears\r\nand extracted it from blood; the crowding of the slaveships, the horrors\r\nof the middle passage, the landing of the ill-fated captives were\r\nvividly related, and the sad story of ages of bondage. It seemed as if\r\nthe sorrow of centuries was sobbing in her voice. Then the scene\r\nchanged, and like a grand triumphal march she recounted the deliverance\r\nof the Negro, and the wondrous change which had come over his condition;\r\nthe slave pen exchanged for the free school, the fetters on his wrist\r\nfor the ballot in his right hand. Then her voice grew musical when she\r\nbegan to speak of the mission of the Negro, "His mission," she said, "is\r\ngrandly constructive." Some races had been "architects of destruction,"\r\nbut their mission was to build over the ruins of the dead past, the most\r\nvaluable thing that a man or woman could possess on earth, and that is\r\ngood character. That mission should be to bless and not to curse. To\r\nlift up the banner of the Christian religion from the mire and dust into\r\nwhich slavery and pride of caste had trailed it, and to hold it up as an\r\nensign of hope and deliverance to other races of the world, of whom the\r\ngreater portion were not white people. It seemed as if an inspiration\r\nlit up the young face; her eye glowed with unwonted fervor; it seemed as\r\nif she had fused her whole soul into the subject, which was full of\r\nearnestness and enthusiasm. Her theme was the sensation of the hour. Men\r\ngrew thoughtful and attentive, women tender and sympathetic as they\r\nheard this member of a once despised people, recount the trials and\r\ntriumphs of her race, and the hopes that gathered around their future.\r\nThe day before Annette graduated Mr. Thomas had met a friend of his at\r\nMrs. Lasette\'s, who had lately returned from an extensive tour. He had\r\nmingled with many people and had acquired a large store of information.\r\nMr. Thomas had invited him to accompany him to the commencement. He had\r\nexpected that Annette would acquit herself creditably, but she had far\r\nexceeded his most sanguine expectations. Clarence Luzerne had come\r\nbecause his friend Mr. Thomas had invited him and because he and Mrs.\r\nLasette had taken such great interest in Annette\'s welfare, and his\r\ncuriosity was excited to see how she would acquit herself and compare\r\nwith the other graduates. He did not have much faith in graduating\r\nessays. He had heard a number of such compositions at commencements\r\nwhich had inspired him with glowing hopes for the future of the authors,\r\nwhich he had never seen realized, and he had come more to gratify Mr.\r\nThomas than to please himself. But if he came through curiosity, he\r\nremained through interest, which had become more and more absorbing as\r\nshe proceeded.\r\n\r\n"Clarence," said Mr. Thomas to his friend, noticing the deep interest he\r\nwas manifesting, "Are you entranced? You appear perfectly spell-bound."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am; I am really delighted and indebted to you for a rare and\r\nunexpected pleasure. Why, that young lady gave the finest production\r\nthat I have heard this morning. I hardly think she could have written it\r\nherself. It seems wonderful that a girl of her age should have done it\r\nso well. You are a great friend of hers; now own up, are not your finger\r\nmarks upon it? I wouldn\'t tell it out of our ranks, but I don\'t think\r\nshe wrote that all herself."\r\n\r\n"Who do you think wrote it for her?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lasette."\r\n\r\n"I do not think so; Mrs. Lasette is a fine writer, but that nervous,\r\nfervid and impassioned style is so unlike hers, that I do not think she\r\nwrote one line of it, though she might have overlooked it, and made\r\nsome suggestions, but even if it were so that some one else wrote it, we\r\nknow that no one else delivered it, and that her delivery was\r\nexcellent."\r\n\r\n"That is so; why, she excelled all the other girls. Do you know what was\r\nthe difference between her and the other girls?"\r\n\r\n"No; what was it?" said Mr. Thomas.\r\n\r\n"They wrote from their heads, she wrote from her heart. Annette has\r\nbegun to think; she has been left a great deal to herself, and in her\r\nloneliness, she has developed a thoughtfulness past her years, and I\r\nthink that a love for her race and a desire to serve it has become a\r\ngrowing passion in her soul; her heart has supplied her intellect."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I think from what you say that I get the true clue to the power and\r\npathos with which she spoke this morning and that accounts for her\r\nwonderful success."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr. Luzerne,[14] "it is the inner life which develops the\r\nouter life, and just such young people as Annette make me more hopeful\r\nof the future of the race."\r\n\r\nMrs. Lasette witnessed Annette\'s graduation with intense interest and\r\npleasure. Grandmother Harcourt looked the very impersonation of\r\nsatisfaction as she gathered up the floral gifts, and modestly waited\r\nwhile Annette received the pleasant compliments of admiring friends.\r\n\r\nAt his request Mr. Thomas introduced Mr. Luzerne to Annette, who in the\r\nmost gracious and affable manner, tendered to Annette his hearty\r\ncongratulations which she modestly received, and for the time being all\r\nwent merry as a marriage bell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n"What a fool he is to refuse my offer," thought the saloon-keeper.\r\n"What a pity it is," said Mr. Thomas to himself, "that a man of his\r\neducation and ability should be engaged in such accursed business."\r\n\r\nAfter refusing the saloonkeeper\'s offer Mr. Thomas found a job of\r\nwork. It was not a job congenial to his feelings, but his motto was,\r\n"If I do not see an opening I will make one." After he had turned\r\nfrom Mr. Englishman\'s workshop, burning with a sense of wrong which\r\nhe felt powerless to overcome, he went on the levee and looked around\r\nto see if any work might be picked up by him as a day laborer. He saw\r\na number of men singing, joking and plying their tasks with nimble\r\nfeet and apparently no other care upon their minds than meeting the\r\ndemands of the present hour, and for a moment he almost envied their\r\nlightheartedness, and he thought within himself, where all men are born\r\nblind, no man misses the light. These men are contented with privileges,\r\nand I who have fitted myself for a different sphere in life, am chaffing\r\nbecause I am denied rights. The right to sell my labor in any workshop\r\nin this city same as the men of other nationalities, and to receive with\r\nthem a fair day\'s wages for a fair day\'s work. But he was strong and\r\nhealthy and he was too high spirited to sit moping at home depending\r\nupon his mother to divide with him her scanty means till something\r\nshould turn up. The first thing that presented itself to him was the job\r\nof helping unload a boat which had landed at the wharf, and a hand was\r\nneeded to assist in unloading her. Mr. Thomas accepted the position and\r\nwent to work and labored manfully at the unaccustomed task. That being\r\nfinished the merchant for whom he had done the work, hired him to labor\r\nin his warehouse. He showed himself very handy in making slight repairs\r\nwhen needed and being ready to turn his hand to any service out of his\r\nroutine of work, hammering a nail, adjusting a disordered lock and\r\nshowing a general concern in his employer\'s interests. One day his\r\nemployer had engaged a carpenter to make him a counter, but the man\r\ninstead of attending to his work had been off on a drunken spree, and\r\nneglected to do the job. The merchant, vexed at the unnecessary delay,\r\nsaid to Mr. Thomas in a bantering manner, "I believe you can do almost\r\nanything, couldn\'t you make this counter?"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas answered quite modestly, "I believe I could if I had my\r\ntools."\r\n\r\n"Tools! What do you mean by tools?"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas told him how he learned to be a carpenter in the South and\r\nhow he had tried so unsuccessfully in the North to get an opportunity to\r\nwork at his trade until discouraged with the attempt, he had made up his\r\nmind to take whatever work came to hand till he could see farther.\r\n\r\nThe merchant immediately procured the materials and set Mr. Thomas to\r\nwork, who in a short time finished the counter, and showed by his\r\nworkmanship that he was an excellent carpenter. The merchant pleased\r\nwith his work and satisfied with his ability, entrusted him with the\r\nerection of a warehouse and, strange as it may appear, some of those men\r\nwho were too proud or foolish to work with him as a fellow laborer, were\r\nhumble enough to work under him as journeymen. When he was down they\r\nwere ready to kick him down. When he was up they were ready to receive\r\nhis helping hand. Mr. Thomas soon reached that "tide in his affairs\r\nwhich taken at the flood leads on to fortune." Against the odds which\r\nwere against him his pluck and perseverance prevailed, and he was\r\nenabled not only to build up a good business for himself, but also to\r\nhelp others, and to teach them by his own experience not to be too\r\neasily discouraged, but to trust to pluck more than luck, and learn in\r\nwhatever capacity they were employed to do their work heartily as unto\r\nthe Lord and not unto men.\r\n\r\nAnxious to do what she could to benefit the community in which she\r\nlived, Mrs. Lasette threw open her parlors for the gathering together\r\nof the best thinkers and workers of the race, who choose to avail\r\nthemselves of the privilege of meeting to discuss any question of vital\r\nimportance to the welfare of the colored people of the nation. Knowing\r\nthe entail of ignorance which slavery had left them, she could not be\r\ncontent by shutting up herself to mere social enjoyments within the\r\nshadow of her home. And often the words would seem to ring within her\r\nsoul, "my people is destroyed for lack of knowledge," and with those\r\nwords would come the question, am I doing what I can to dispel the\r\ndarkness which has hung for centuries around our path? I have been\r\nblessed with privileges which were denied others; I sat \'mid the light\r\nof knowledge when some of my ill-fated sisters did not know what it was\r\nto see daylight in their cabins from one week\'s end to the other.\r\nSometimes when she met with coldness and indifference where she least\r\nexpected it, she would grow sad but would not yield to discouragement.\r\nHer heart was in the right place. "Freely she had received and freely\r\nshe would give." It was at one of Mrs. Lasette\'s gatherings that Mr.\r\nThomas met Rev. Mr. Lomax on whose church he had been refused a place,\r\nand Mr. Thurman, a tradesman who also had been ousted from his position\r\nthrough pride of caste and who had gone into another avocation, and\r\nalso Charley Cooper, of whom we have lost sight for a number of years.\r\nHe is now a steady and prosperous young man, a constant visitor at\r\nMrs. Lasette\'s. Rumor says that Mrs. Lasette\'s bright-eyed and lovely\r\ndaughter is the magnet which attracts him to their pleasant home. Rev.\r\nLomax has also been absent for several years on other charges, but when\r\nhe meets Mr. Thomas, the past flows back and the incidents of their\r\nlatest interviews naturally take their place in the conversation. "It\r\nhas been some time since we met," said Mr. Thomas, heartily shaking the\r\nminister\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"How has life used you since last we met?" said Rev. Lomax to Mr.\r\nThomas. "Are you well?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly well, I have had a varied experience since I met you, but\r\nI have no reason to complain, and I think my experience has been\r\ninvaluable to me, and with this larger experience and closer\r\nobservation, I feel that I am more able to help others, and that, I\r\nfeel, has been one of my most valued acquirements. I sometimes think\r\nof members of our people in some directions as sheep without a\r\nshepherd, and I do wish from the bottom of my heart that I knew the\r\nbest way to help them."\r\n\r\n"You do not," said the minister, somewhat anxiously, "ignore the power\r\nof the pulpit."\r\n\r\n"No, I do not; I only wish it had tenfold force. I wish we had ten\r\nthousand ministers like Oberlin who was not ashamed to take the lead\r\nin opening a road from Bande Roche to Strasburgh, a distance of several\r\nmiles to bring his parishioners in contact with the trade and business\r\nof a neighboring village. I hope the time will come when every minister\r\nin building a church which he consecrates to the worship of God will\r\nbuild alongside of it or under the same roof, parish buildings or rooms\r\nto be dedicated to the special wants of our people in their peculiar\r\ncondition."\r\n\r\n"I do wish, Brother Lomax, those costly buildings which you erect will\r\ncover more needs and wants of our people than some of them do now."\r\n\r\n"What would you have in them?"\r\n\r\n"I would have a parish building to every church, and I would have in\r\nthem an evening home for boys. I would have some persons come in and\r\nteach them different handicrafts, so as at least to give them an\r\nopportunity to be more expert in learning how to use their hands. I\r\nwould have that building a well warmed and well lighted room in winter,\r\nwhere all should be welcome to come and get a sandwich and a warm cup\r\nof tea or coffee and a hot bowl of soup, and if the grogshops were\r\nselling liquor for five cents, I would sell the soup for three or four\r\ncents, with a roll. I would have a room reserved for such ladies as Mrs.\r\nLasette, who are so willing to help, for the purpose of holding mother\'s\r\nmeetings. I would try to have the church the great centre of moral,\r\nspiritual and intellectual life for the young, and try to present\r\ncounter attractions to the debasing influence of the low grogshops,\r\ngambling dens and houses of ill fame."\r\n\r\n"Part of our city (ought I confine myself to saying part of the city)\r\nhas not the whole city been cursed by rum? But I now refer to a special\r\npart. I have seen church after church move out of that part of the city\r\nwhere the nuisance and curse were so rife, but I never, to my knowledge,\r\nheard of one of those churches offering to build a reading room and\r\nevening home for boys, or to send out paid and sustained by their\r\nefforts, a single woman to go into rum-cursed homes and teach their\r\ninmates a more excellent way. I would have in that parish building the\r\nmost earnest men and women to come together and consult and counsel\r\nwith each other on the best means to open for ourselves, doors which\r\nare still closed against us."\r\n\r\n"I am sure," said the minister, "I am willing to do what I can for the\r\ntemporal and spiritual welfare of our people, and in this I have the\r\nexample of the great Physician who did not consider it beneath him to\r\nattend to physical maladies as well as spiritual needs, and who did not\r\nconsider the synagogue too holy, nor the Sabbath day too sacred to\r\nadminister to the destitute and suffering."\r\n\r\n"I was very sorry when I found out, Brother Thomas, that I could not\r\nhave you employed on my church, but I do not see what else I could have\r\ndone except submit."\r\n\r\n"That was all you could have done in that stage of the work when I\r\napplied, and I do not wish to bestow the slightest censure on you or the\r\ntrustees of your church, but I think, if when you were about to build\r\nhad you advertised for competent master-builders in the South, that you\r\ncould have gotten enough to have built the church without having\r\nemployed Mr. Hoog the master-builder. Had you been able to have gone to\r\nhim and said, \'we are about to build a church and it is more convenient\r\nfor us to have it done by our citizens than to send abroad for laborers.\r\nWe are in communication with a colored master builder in Kentucky, who\r\nis known as an efficient workman and who would be glad to get the job,\r\nand if your men refuse to work with a colored man our only alternative\r\nwill be to send for colored carpenters and put the building in their\r\nhands.\' Do you think he would have refused a thirty thousand dollar job\r\njust because some of his men refused to work with colored men? I think\r\nthe greater portion of his workmen would have held their prejudices in\r\nabeyance rather than let a thirty thousand dollar job slip out of their\r\nhands. Now here is another thing in which I think united effort could\r\nhave effected something. Now, here is my friend Mr. Thurman; he was a\r\nsaddler versed in both branches of harness making. For awhile he got\r\nsteady work in a saddler\'s shop, but the prejudice against him was so\r\ngreat that his employer was forced to dismiss him. He took work home,\r\nbut that did not heal the dissatisfaction, and at last he gave it up\r\nand went to well-digging. Now, there were colored men in that place\r\nwho could have, as I think, invested some money in buying material\r\nand helped him, not as a charity, but as a mere business operation\r\nto set up a place for himself; he had the skill; they had the money,\r\nand had they united both perhaps to-day there would be a flourishing\r\nbusiness carried on by the man who is now digging wells for a living.\r\nI do hope that some time there will be some better modes of\r\ncommunication between us than we now possess; that a labor bureau\r\nwill be established not as a charity among us, but as a business\r\nwith capable and efficient men who will try to find out the different\r\nindustries that will employ men irrespective of color and advertise\r\nand find steady and reliable colored men to fill them. Colored men\r\nin the South are largely employed in raising cotton and other produce;\r\nwhy should there not be more openings in the South for colored men\r\nto handle the merchandize and profit by it?"\r\n\r\n"What hinders?" said Rev. Lomax.\r\n\r\n"I will not say what hinders, but I will say what I think you can try\r\nto do to help. Teach our young to dedicate their young lives to the\r\nnoble service of devoting them to the service of our common cause; to\r\nthrow away their cigars, dash down the foaming beer and sparkling wine\r\nand strive to be more like those of whom it was said, \'I write unto you,\r\nyoung men, because you are strong.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nGrandmother Harcourt was failing. Annette was rising towards life\'s\r\nsummit. Her grandmother was sinking to death\'s vale.\r\n\r\n  The hours are rifting day by day\r\n  Strength from the walls of living clay.\r\n\r\nHer two children who were living in A.P. wished her to break up her home\r\nand come and live with them. They had room in their hearts and homes for\r\nher, but not for Annette. There was something in Annette\'s temperament\r\nwith which other members of the family could not harmonize. They were\r\nnot considerate enough to take into account her antenatal history, and\r\nto pity where they were so ready to condemn. Had Annette been born\r\ndeficient in any of her bodily organs, they could have made allowance\r\nfor her, and would have deemed it cruel to have demanded that she should\r\nhave performed the same amount of labor with one hand that she could\r\nhave done with both. They knew nothing of heredity, except its effects,\r\nwhich they were not thoughtful enough to trace back to the causes over\r\nwhich Annette had no control, and instead of trying to counteract them\r\nas one might strive to do in a case of inherited physical tendencies,\r\nthey only aggravated, and constantly strengthened all the unlovely\r\nfeatures in Annette\'s character, and Annette really seemed like an\r\nanomalous contradiction. There was a duality about her nature as if\r\nthe blood of two races were mingling in her veins. To some persons\r\nAnnette was loving and love-able, bright, intelligent, obliging and\r\ncompanionable; to others, unsociable, unamiable and repelling. Her heart\r\nwas like a harp which sent out its harmonious discords in accordance\r\nwith the moods of the player who touched its chords. To some who swept\r\nthem it gave out tender and touching melody, to others its harshest and\r\nsaddest discords. Did not the Psalmist look beneath the mechanism of the\r\nbody to the constitution of the soul when he said that "We are fearfully\r\nand wonderfully made?"\r\n\r\nBut the hour came when all discussion was ended as to who was to shelter\r\nthe dear old grandmother in her declining years. Mrs. Harcourt was\r\nsuddenly paralyzed, and in a few days Annette stood doubly orphaned.\r\nGrandmother Harcourt\'s children gathered around the bedside of their\r\ndying mother. She was conscious but unable to speak. Occasionally her\r\neyes would rest lovingly upon Annette and then turn wistfully to her\r\nchildren. Several times she assayed to speak, but the words died upon\r\nher lips. Her eldest son entered the room just as life was trembling on\r\nits faintest chords. She recognized him, and gathering up her remaining\r\nstrength she placed his hand on Annette\'s, and tried again to speak. He\r\nunderstood her and said very tenderly,\r\n\r\n"Mother, I will look after Annette."\r\n\r\nAll the care faded from the dear old face. Amid the shadows that never\r\ndeceive flitted a smile of peace and contentment. The fading eye lit up\r\nwith a sudden gaze of joy and wonder. She reached out her hand as if to\r\nmeet a welcome and precious friend, and then the radiant face grew\r\ndeathly pale; the outstretched hands relaxed their position, and with a\r\nsmile, just such a smile as might greet a welcoming angel, her spirit\r\npassed out into the eternities, and Annette felt as she had never felt\r\nbefore, that she was all alone. The love that had surrounded and watched\r\nover her, born with her perverseness, and sheltered her in its warm\r\nclasp, was gone; it had faded suddenly from her vision, and left in its\r\nstead a dull and heavy pain. After the funeral, Mrs. Harcourt\'s children\r\nreturned to the house where they quietly but earnestly discussed the\r\nquestion what shall be done with Annette. Mrs. Hanson\'s house was rather\r\nsmall; that is, it was rather small for Annette. She would have found\r\nroom in her house if she only had room in her heart for her. She had\r\nnursed her mother through her sickness, and said with unnatural\r\ncoldness, "I have got rid of one trouble and I do not want another."\r\nAnother sister who lived some distance from A.P., would have taken\r\nAnnette, but she knew that other members of her family would object, as\r\nthey would be fearful that Annette would be an apple of discord among\r\nthem. At length, her uncle Thomas decided that she should go with him.\r\nHe felt that his mother had died with the assurance on her mind that he\r\nwould care for Annette, and he resolved to be faithful in accepting what\r\nwas to him the imposition of a new burden on his shoulders. His wife was\r\na cold and unsympathizing woman. She was comfortably situated but did\r\nnot wish that comfort invaded by her husband\'s relations. In household\r\nmatters her husband generally deferred to her judgment, but here was no\r\nother alternative than that of taking Annette under the shadow of his\r\nhome, or leaving her unprotected in the wide world, and he was too\r\nmerciful and honorable to desert Annette in her saddest hour of need.\r\nHaving determined that Annette should share his home, he knew that it\r\nwas advisable to tell his wife about his decision, and to prepare her\r\nfor Annette\'s coming.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Dr. Harcourt\'s wife after her husband\'s return from the\r\nfuneral, "what are you going to do with Annette?"\r\n\r\n"She is coming here," said Dr. Harcourt quietly and firmly.\r\n\r\n"Coming here?" said Mrs. Harcourt, looking aghast. "I think at least you\r\nmight have consulted me."\r\n\r\n"That is true, my dear, I would have gladly done so had you been present\r\nwhen the decision was made."\r\n\r\n"But where are her aunts, and where was your brother, John; why didn\'t\r\nthey take her?"\r\n\r\n"John was at home sick with the rheumatism and sister Jane did not\r\nappear to be willing to have her come."\r\n\r\n"I guess Jane is like I am; got enough to do to look after her own\r\nfamily."\r\n\r\n"And sister Eliza said she hadn\'t any room."\r\n\r\n"No room; when she has eight rooms in her house and only two children?\r\nShe could have made room for her had she chosen."\r\n\r\n"May be her husband wasn\'t willing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is no such thing. I know John Hanson[15] better than that; Liza\r\nis the head man of that house, and just leads him by the nose wherever\r\nshe wants him to go, and besides, Mrs. Lord\'s daughter is there\r\npretending to pay board, but I don\'t believe that she pays it one-half\r\nthe time."\r\n\r\n"She is company for Alice and they all seem very fond of her."\r\n\r\n"I do get so sick of that girl, mambying and jambying about that family;\r\ncalling Liza and her husband \'Ma and Pa,\' I haven\'t a bit of faith in\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Well, I confess that I am not very much preposessed in her favor. She\r\njust puts me in mind of a pussy cat purring around you."\r\n\r\n"Well, now as to Annette. You do not want her here?"\r\n\r\n"Not if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"But can\'t she help you to work?"\r\n\r\n"She could if she knew how. If wishes were horses beggars might ride.\r\nYour mother made a great mistake in bringing Annette up. Annette has a\r\ngood education, but when that is said, all is said."\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear mother was an excellent housekeeper. Did she not teach\r\nAnnette?"\r\n\r\n"Your mother was out a great deal as a sick nurse, and when she went\r\naway from home she generally boarded Annette with a friend, who did not,\r\nas your mother paid her good board, exact any service from Annette, and\r\nwhile with her she never learned to make a loaf of bread or to cook a\r\nbeefsteak, and when your mother was at home when she set Annette to do\r\nany work, if she did it awkwardly and clumsily she would take it out of\r\nher hand and do it herself rather than bother with her, and now I\r\nsuppose I am to have all the bother and worry with her."\r\n\r\n"Well my dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh don\'t come dearing me, and bringing me all this trouble."\r\n\r\n"Well my dear, I don\'t see how it could be helped. I could not leave\r\nAnnette in the house all by herself. I couldn\'t afford to make myself\r\nthe town\'s talk. May be things will turn out better than you expect.\r\nWe\'ve got children of our own, and we don\'t know when we are gone, how\r\nthey will fare."\r\n\r\n"That is true, but I never mean to bring my children up in such a way\r\nthat they will be no use anywhere, and no one will want them."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t see any other way than bringing Annette here."\r\n\r\n"Well, if I must, I must," she said with an air of despondency.\r\n\r\nDr. Harcourt rode over to his sister\'s where Annette was spending the\r\nday and brought the doubly orphaned girl to his home. As she entered the\r\nroom, it seemed as though a chill struck to her heart when her Aunt bade\r\nher good morning. There was no warm pressure in the extended hand. No\r\nloving light in the cold unsympathizing eyes which seemed to stab her\r\nthrough and through. The children eyed her inquisitively, as if wishing\r\nto understand her status with their parents before they became sociable\r\nwith her. After supper Annette\'s uncle went out and her aunt sat quietly\r\nand sewed till bed time, and then showed Annette to her room and left\r\nthe lonely girl to herself and her great sorrow. Annette sat silent,\r\ntearless, and alone. Grief had benumbed her faculties. She had sometimes\r\nsaid when grandmother had scolded her that "she was growing cross and\r\ncold." But oh, what would she not have given to have had the\r\ndeath-created silence broken by that dear departed voice, to have felt\r\nthe touch of a vanished hand, to have seen again the loving glance of\r\nthe death darkened eye. But it was all over; no tears dimmed her eye, as\r\nshe sat thinking so mournfully of her great sorrow, till she unfastened\r\nfrom her neck a little keepsake containing a lock of grandmother\'s hair,\r\nthen all the floodgates of her soul were opened and she threw herself\r\nupon her bed and sobbed herself to sleep. In the morning she awoke with\r\nthat sense of loss and dull agony which only they know, who have seen\r\nthe grave close over all they have held dearest on earth. The beautiful\r\nhome of her uncle was very different from the humble apartments; here\r\nshe missed all the freedom and sunshine that she had enjoyed beneath the\r\nshelter of her grandmother\'s roof.\r\n\r\n"Can you sew?" said her aunt to Annette, as she laid on the table a\r\npackage of handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n"Yes ma\'m."\r\n\r\n"Let me see how you can do this," handing her one to hem. Annette hemmed\r\nthe handkerchief nicely; her aunt examined it, put it down and gave her\r\nsome others to hem, but there was no word of encouragement for her, not\r\neven a pleasant, "well done." They both relapsed into silence; between\r\nthem there was no pleasant interchange of thought. Annette was tolerated\r\nand endured, but she did not feel that she was loved and welcomed. It\r\nwas no place to which she could invite her young friends to spend a\r\npleasant evening. Once she invited some of her young friends to her\r\nhome, but she soon found that it was a liberty which she should be\r\ncareful never to repeat. Soon after Annette came to live with her aunt\r\nher aunt\'s mother had a social gathering and reunion of the members of\r\nher family. All Dr. Harcourt\'s children were invited, from the least to\r\nthe greatest, but poor Annette was left behind. Mrs. Lasette, who\r\nhappened in the house the evening before the entertainment, asked, "Is\r\nnot Annette going?" when Mrs. Harcourt replied, very coldly, "She is not\r\none of the family," referring to her mother\'s family circle.\r\n\r\nA shadow flitted over the face of Mrs. Lasette; she thought of her own\r\ndaughter and how sad it would be to have her live in such a chilly\r\natmosphere of social repression and neglect at a period of life when\r\nthere was so much danger that false friendship might spread their lures\r\nfor her inexperienced feet. I will criticize, she said to herself, by\r\ncreation. I, too, have some social influence, if not among the careless,\r\nwine-bibbing, ease-loving votaries of fashion, among some of the most\r\nsubstantial people of A.P., and as long as Annette preserves her\r\nrectitude at my house she shall be a welcome guest and into that\r\nsaddened life I will bring all the sunshine that I can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well mama," said Mrs. Lasette\'s daughter to her mother, "I cannot\r\nunderstand why you take so much interest in Annette. She is very\r\nunpopular. Scarcely any of the girls ever go with her, and even her\r\ncousin never calls for her to go to church or anywhere else, and I\r\nsometimes feel so sorry to see her so much by herself, and some of the\r\ngirls when I went with her to the exposition, said that they wouldn\'t\r\nhave asked her to have gone with them, that she isn\'t our set."\r\n\r\n"Poor child," Mrs. Lasette replied; "I am sorry for her. I hope that you\r\nwill never treat her unkindly, and I do not think if you knew the sad\r\nstory connected with her life that you would ever be unkind enough to\r\nadd to the burden she has been forced to bear."\r\n\r\n"But mamma, Annette is so touchy. Her aunt says that her tear bags must\r\nlay near her eyes and that she will cry if you look at her, and that she\r\nis the strangest, oddest creature she ever saw, and I heard she did not\r\nwish her to come."\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear child, who has been gossipping to you about your\r\nneighbors?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Julia Thomas."\r\n\r\n"Well, my daughter, don\'t talk after her; gossip is liable to degenerate\r\ninto evil speaking and then I think it tends to degrade and belittle the\r\nmind to dwell on the defects and imperfections of our neighbors. Learn\r\nto dwell on the things that are just and true and of good report, but I\r\nam sorry for Annette, poor child."\r\n\r\n"What makes her so strange, do you know?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Lasette somewhat absently.\r\n\r\n"If you do, won\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs. Lasette answered in the same absent manner.\r\n\r\n"Why mama, what is the matter with you; you say yes to everything and\r\nyet you are not paying any attention to anything that I say. You seem\r\nlike someone who hears, but does not listen; who sees, but does not\r\nlook. Your face reminds me of the time when I showed you the picture of\r\na shipwreck and you said, \'My brother\'s boat went down in just such a\r\nfearful storm.\'"\r\n\r\n"My dear child," said Mrs. Lasette, rousing up from a mournful reverie,\r\n"I was thinking of a wreck sadder, far sadder than the picture you\r\nshowed me. It was the mournful wreck of a blighted life."\r\n\r\n"Whose life, mama?"\r\n\r\n"The life of Annette\'s [grand]mother. We were girls together and I loved\r\nher dearly," Mrs. Lasette replied as tears gathered in her eyes when she\r\nrecalled one of the saddest memories of her life.\r\n\r\n"Do tell me all about it, for I am full of curiosity."\r\n\r\n"My child, I want this story to be more than food for your curiosity; I\r\nwant it to be a lesson and a warning to you. Annette\'s grandmother was\r\nleft to struggle as breadwinner for a half dozen children when her\r\nhusband died. Then there were not as many openings for colored girls as\r\nthere are now. Our chief resource was the field of domestic service, and\r\ncircumstances compelled Annette\'s mother to live out, as we called it.\r\nIn those days we did not look down upon a girl and try to ostracize her\r\nfrom our social life if she was forced to be a servant. If she was poor\r\nand respectable we valued her for what she was rather than for what she\r\npossessed. Of course we girls liked to dress nicely, but fine clothes\r\nwas not the chief passport to our society, and yet I think on the whole\r\nthat our social life would compare favorably with yours in good\r\ncharacter, if not in intellectual attainments. Our dear old mothers were\r\ngenerally ignorant of books, but they did try to teach good manners and\r\ngood behavior; but I do not think they saw the danger around the paths\r\nof the inexperienced with the same clearness of vision we now do. Mrs.\r\nHarcourt had unbounded confidence in her children, and as my mother\r\nthought, gave her girls too much rein in their own hands. Our mother was\r\nmore strict with her daughters and when we saw Mrs. Harcourt\'s daughters\r\nhaving what we considered such good times, I used to say, \'O, I wish\r\nmother wasn\'t so particular!\' Other girls could go unattended to\r\nexcursions, moonlight drives and parties of pleasure, but we never went\r\nto any such pleasure unless we were attended by our father, brother or\r\nsome trusted friend of the family. We were young and foolish then and\r\nused to chafe against her restrictions; but to-day, when I think of my\r\nown good and noble husband, my little bright and happy home, and my\r\ndear, loving daughter, I look back with gratitude to her thoughtful care\r\nand honor and bless her memory in her grave. Poor Lucy Harcourt was not\r\nso favored; she was pretty and attractive and had quite a number of\r\nadmirers. At length she became deeply interested in a young man who came\r\nas a stranger to our city. He was a fine looking man, but there was\r\nsomething about him from which I instinctively shrank. My mother felt\r\nthe same way and warned us to be careful how we accepted any attention\r\nfrom him; but poor Lucy became perfectly infatuated with him and it was\r\nrumored that they were to be shortly married. Soon after the rumor he\r\nleft the city and there was a big change in Lucy\'s manner. I could not\r\ntell what was the matter, but my mother forbade me associating with her,\r\nand for several months I scarcely saw her, but I could hear from others\r\nthat she was sadly changed. Instead of being one of the most\r\nlight-hearted girls, I heard that she used to sit day after day in her\r\nmother\'s house and wring her hands and weep and that her mother\'s heart\r\nwas almost broken. Friends feared that Lucy was losing her mind and\r\nmight do some desperate deed, but she did not. I left about that time to\r\nteach school in a distant village, and when I returned home I heard sad\r\ntidings of poor Lucy. She was a mother, but not a wife. Her brothers had\r\ngrown angry with her for tarnishing their family name, of which they\r\nwere so proud; her mother\'s head was bowed with agony and shame. The\r\nfather of Lucy\'s child had deserted her in her hour of trial and left\r\nher to bear her burden alone with the child like a millstone around her\r\nneck. Poor Lucy; I seldom saw her after that, but one day I met her in\r\nthe Park. I went up to her and kissed her, she threw her arms around me\r\nand burst into a flood of tears. I tried to restrain her from giving\r\nsuch vent to her feelings. It was a lack of self-control which had\r\nplaced her where she was."\r\n\r\n"\'Oh Anna!\' she said, \'it does me so much good to hold your hand in mine\r\nonce more. I reminds me of the days when we used to be together. Oh,\r\nwhat would I give to recall those days.\'"\r\n\r\n"I said to her, Lucy, you can never recall the past, but you can try to\r\nredeem the future. Try to be a faithful mother. Men may build over the\r\nwreck and ruin of their young lives a better and brighter future, why\r\nshould not a woman? Let the dead past bury its dead and live in the\r\nfuture for the sake of your child. She seemed so grateful for what I had\r\nsaid. Others had treated her with scorn. Her brother Thomas had refused\r\nto speak to her; her betrayer had forsaken her; all the joyousness had\r\nfaded from her life and, poor girl, I was glad that I was able to say a\r\nhelpful and hopeful word to her. Mother, of course, would not let us\r\nassociate with her, but she always treated her kindly when she came and\r\ndid what she could to lighten the burden which was pressing her down to\r\nthe grave. But, poor child, she was never again the same light-hearted\r\ngirl. She grew pale and thin and in the hectic flush and faltering\r\ntread I read the death sign of early decay, and I felt that my misguided\r\nyoung friend was slowly dying of a broken heart. Then there came a day\r\nwhen we were summoned to her dying bed. Her brothers and sisters were\r\npresent; all their resentment against her had vanished in the presence\r\nof death. She was their dear sister about to leave them and they bent in\r\ntearful sorrow around her couch. As one of her brothers, who was a good\r\nsinger, entered the room, she asked him to sing \'Vital spark of heavenly\r\nflame.\' He attempted to sing, but there were tremors in his voice and he\r\nfaltered in the midst of the hymn. \'Won\'t you sing for your dying\r\nsister.\'"\r\n\r\n"Again he essayed to sing, but [his?] voice became choked with emotion,\r\nand he ceased, and burst into tears. Her brother Thomas who had been so\r\nhard and cold, and had refused to speak to her, now wept and sobbed like\r\na child, but Lucy smiled as she bade them good bye, and exclaimed,\r\n\'Welcome death, the end of fear. I am prepared to die.\' A sweet peace\r\nsettled down on her face, and Lucy had exchanged, I hope, the sorrow and\r\npain of life for the peace and rest of heaven, and left Annette too\r\nyoung to know her loss. Do you wonder then my child that I feel such an\r\ninterest in Annette and that knowing as I do her antenatal history that\r\nI am ever ready to pity where others condemn, and that I want to do what\r\nI can to help round out in beauty and usefulness the character of that\r\nsinned against and disinherited child, whose restlessness and\r\nsensitiveness I trace back to causes over which she had no control."\r\n\r\n"What became of Frank Miller? You say that when he returned to A.P. that\r\nsociety opened its doors to him while they were closed to Annette\'s\r\nmother. I don\'t understand it. Was he not as guilty as she was?"\r\n\r\n"Guiltier, I think. If poor Lucy failed as a woman, she tried to be\r\nfaithful as a mother, while he, faithless as a man, left her to bear her\r\nburden alone. She was frail as a woman, but he was base, mean, and\r\nselfish as a man."\r\n\r\n"How was it that society received him so readily?"\r\n\r\n"All did not receive him so readily, but with some his money, like\r\ncharity, covered a multitude of sins. But from the depths of my heart I\r\ndespised him. I had not then learned to hate the sin with all my heart,\r\nand yet the sinner love. To me he was the incarnation of social meanness\r\nand vice. And just as I felt I acted. We young folks had met at a social\r\ngathering, and were engaged in a pastime in which we occasionally\r\nclasped hands together. Some of these plays I heartily disliked,\r\nespecially when there was romping and promiscuous kissing. During the\r\nplay Frank Miller\'s hand came in contact with mine and he pressed it. I\r\ncan hardly describe my feelings. It seemed as if my very veins were on\r\nfire, and that every nerve was thrilling with repulsion and indignation.\r\nHad I seen him murder Lucy and then turn with blood dripping hands to\r\ngrasp mine, I do not think that I should have felt more loathing than I\r\ndid when his hand clasped mine. I felt that his very touch was\r\npollution; I immediately left the play, tore off my glove, and threw it\r\nin the fire."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother, how could you have done so? You are so good and gentle."\r\n\r\nMrs. Lasette replied, "I was not always so. I do not hate his sin any\r\nless now than I did then but I think that I have learned a Christian\r\ncharity which would induce me to pluck such as he out of the fire while\r\nI hated the garments spotted by his sins. I sat down trembling with\r\nemotion. I heard a murmur of disapprobation. There was a check to the\r\ngayety of the evening. Frank Miller, bold and bad as he was looked\r\ncrestfallen and uneasy. Some who appeared to be more careful of the\r\nmanners of society than its morals, said that I was very rude. Others\r\nsaid that I was too prudish, and would be an old maid, that I was\r\nlooking for perfection in young men, and would not find it. That young\r\nmen sow their wild oats, and that I was more nice than wise, and that I\r\nwould frighten the gentlemen away from me. I told them if the young men\r\nwere so easily frightened, that I did not wish to clasp hands for life\r\nwith any such timid set, and that I was determined that I would have a\r\nmoral husband or none; that I was not obliged to be married, but that I\r\nwas obliged to be true to my conscience. That when I married I expected\r\nto lay the foundation of a new home, and that I would never trust my\r\nfuture happiness in the hands of a libertine, or lay its foundations\r\nover the reeling brain of a drunkard, and I determined that I would\r\nnever marry a man for whose vices I must blush, and whose crimes I must\r\ncondone; that while I might bend to grief I would not bow to shame; that\r\nif I brought him character and virtue, he should give me true manhood\r\nand honor in return."\r\n\r\n"And I think mother that you got it when you married father."\r\n\r\n"I am satisfied that I did, and the respect and appreciation my daughter\r\nhas for her father is only part of my life\'s reward, but it was my dear\r\nmother who taught me to distinguish between the true and the false, and\r\nalthough she was [not?] what you call educated, she taught me that no\r\nmagnificence of fortune would atone for meanness of spirit, that without\r\ncharacter the most wealthy and talented man is a bankrupt in soul. And\r\nshe taught me how to be worthy of a true man\'s love."\r\n\r\n"And I think you have succeeded splendidly."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my darling. But mother has become used to compliments."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n"I do not think she gets any more than she deserves," said Mr. Lasette,\r\nentering the room. "She is one of whom it may be said, \'Her children\r\narise up and call her blessed, her husband also, and he praiseth her;\r\nmany daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all.\'"\r\n\r\n"I do not think you will say that I am excelling if I do not haste\r\nabout your supper; you were not home to dinner and must be hungry by\r\nthis time, and it has been said that the way to a man\'s heart is through\r\nhis stomach."\r\n\r\n"Oh, isn\'t that a libel on my sex!"\r\n\r\n"Papa," said Laura Lasette, after her mother had left the room, "did you\r\nknow Frank Miller? Mother was telling me about him but she did not\r\nfinish; what became of him?"\r\n\r\n"Now, you ask me two questions in one breath; let me answer one at a\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Well, papa, I am all attention."\r\n\r\n"Do I know Frank Miller, the saloon keeper? Yes; he is connected with a\r\nturning point in my life. How so? Well, just be patient a minute and I\r\nwill tell you. I was almost a stranger in A.P. when I first met your\r\nmother. It was at a social where Frank Miller was a guest. I had heard\r\nsome very damaging reports concerning his reputation, but from the\r\nmanner in which he was received in society, I concluded that I had been\r\nmisinformed. Surely, I thought, if the man is as vicious as he has been\r\nrepresented, good women, while they pity him, will shrink instinctively\r\nfrom him, but I saw to my surprise, that with a confident and unblushing\r\nmanner, he moved among what was called the elite of the place, and that\r\ninstead of being withheld, attentions were lavished upon him. I had\r\nlived most of my life in a small inland town, where people were old\r\nfashioned enough to believe in honor and upright conduct, and from what\r\nI had heard of Frank Miller I was led to despise his vices and detest\r\nhis character, and yet here were women whom I believed to be good and\r\nvirtuous, smiling in his face, and graciously receiving his attentions.\r\nI cannot help thinking that in their case,\r\n\r\n  "Evil is wrought by want of thought"\r\n   As well as want of heart.\r\n\r\nThey were not conscious of the influence they might exert by being true\r\nto their own womanhood. Men like Frank Miller are the deadliest foes of\r\nwomen. One of the best and strongest safe guards of the home is the\r\nintegrity of its women, and he who undermines that, strikes a fearful\r\nblow at the highest and best interests of society. Society is woman\'s\r\nrealm and I never could understand how, if a woman really loves purity\r\nfor its own worth and loveliness, she can socially tolerate men whose\r\nlives are a shame, and whose conduct in society is a blasting, withering\r\ncurse."\r\n\r\n"But, papa, tell me how you came to love my mother; but I don\'t see how\r\nyou could have helped it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it, my daughter. I loved her because I could not help it;\r\nand respected her because I knew that she was worthy of respect. I was\r\npresent at a social gathering where Frank was a guest, and was watching\r\nyour mother attentively when I saw her shrink instinctively from his\r\ntouch and leave the play in which she was engaged and throw her glove in\r\nthe fire. Public opinion was divided about her conduct. Some censured,\r\nothers commended her, but from that hour I learned to love her, and I\r\nbecame her defender. Other women would tolerate Frank Miller, but here\r\nwas a young and gracious girl, strong enough and brave enough to pour on\r\nthe head of that guilty culprit her social disapprobation and I gloried\r\nin her courage. I resolved she should be my wife if she would accept me,\r\nwhich she did, and I have never regretted my choice and I think that I\r\nhave had as happy a life as usually falls to the lot of mortals."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n"Papa," said Laura Lasette, "all the girls have had graduating parties\r\nexcept Annette and myself. Would it not be nice for me to have a party\r\nand lots of fun, and then my birthday comes next week; now wouldn\'t it\r\nbe just the thing for me to have a party?"\r\n\r\n"It might be, darling, for you, but how would it be for me who would\r\nhave to foot the bill?"\r\n\r\n"Well, papa, could you not just give me a check like you do mama\r\nsometimes?"\r\n\r\n"But mama knows how to use it."\r\n\r\n"But papa, don\'t I know how also?"\r\n\r\n"I have my doubts on that score, but let me refer you to your mother.\r\nShe is queen of this realm, and in household matters I as a loyal\r\nsubject, abide by her decisions."\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess mama is all right on this subject."\r\n\r\nMrs. Lasette was perfectly willing to gratify her daughter, and it was\r\ndecided to have an entertainment on Laura\'s birthday.\r\n\r\nThe evening of Mrs. Lasette\'s entertainment came bringing with it into\r\nher pleasant parlors a bright and merry throng of young people. It was\r\nmore than a mere pleasure party. It was here that rising talent was\r\nencouraged, no matter how humble the garb of the possessor, and Mrs.\r\nLasette was a model hostess who would have thought her entertainment a\r\nfailure had any one gone from it smarting under a sense of social\r\nneglect. Shy and easily embarrassed Annette who was very seldom invited\r\nanywhere, found herself almost alone in that gay and chattering throng.\r\nAnnette was seated next to several girls who laughed and chatted\r\nincessantly with each other without deigning to notice her. Mrs. Lasette\r\nentering the room with Mr. Luzerne whom she presented to the company,\r\nand noticing the loneliness and social isolation of Annette, gave him a\r\nseat beside her, and was greatly gratified that she had found the means\r\nto relieve the tedium of Annette\'s position. Mrs. Lasette had known him\r\nas a light hearted boy, full of generous impulses, with laughing eyes\r\nand a buoyant step, but he had been absent a number of years, and had\r\ndeveloped into a handsome man with a magnificent physique, elegant in\r\nhis attire, polished in his manners and brilliant in conversation. Just\r\nsuch a man as is desirable as a companion and valuable as a friend,\r\nstaunch, honorable and true, and it was rumored that he was quite\r\nwealthy. He was generally cheerful, but it seemed at times as if some\r\nsad memories came over him, dashing all the sunshine from his face and\r\nleaving in its stead, a sadness which it was touching to behold. Some\r\nmystery seemed to surround his life, but being reticent in reference to\r\nhis past history, there was a dignity in his manner which repelled all\r\nintrusion into the secrecy over which he choose to cast a veil. Annette\r\nwas not beautiful, but her face was full of expression and her manner\r\nwinsome at times. Lacking social influence and social adaptation, she\r\nhad been ignored in society, her faults of temper made prominent her\r\nmost promising traits of character left unnoticed, but this treatment\r\nwas not without some benefit to Annette. It threw her more entirely on\r\nher own resources. At first she read when she had leisure, to beguile\r\nher lonely hours, and fortunately for her, she was directed in her\r\nreading by Mrs. Lasette, who gave and lent her books, which appealed to\r\nall that was highest and best in her nature, and kindled within her a\r\nlofty enthusiasm to make her life a blessing to the world. With such an\r\nearnest purpose, she was not prepared to be a social favorite in any\r\nsociety whose chief amusement was gossip, and whose keenest weapon was\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\nMr. Luzerne had gone to Mrs. Lasette\'s with the hope of meeting some of\r\nthe best talent in A.P., and had come to the conclusion that there was\r\nmore lulliancy than depth in the intellectual life with which he came in\r\ncontact; he felt that it lacked earnestness, purpose and grand\r\nenthusiasms and he was astonished to see the social isolation of\r\nAnnette, whose society had interested and delighted him, and after\r\nparting with her he found his mind constantly reverting to her and felt\r\ngrateful to Mrs. Lasette for affording him a rare and charming pleasure.\r\nAnnette sat alone in her humble room with a new light in her eyes and a\r\nsense of deep enjoyment flooding her soul. Never before had she met\r\nwith such an interesting and congenial gentleman. He seemed to\r\nunderstand as scarcely as any one else had done or cared to do. In the\r\neyes of other guests she had been treated as if too insignificant for\r\nnotice, but he had loosened her lips and awakened within her a dawning\r\nsense of her own ability, which others had chilled and depressed. He had\r\nfingered the keys of her soul and they had vibrated in music to his\r\ntouch. Do not smile, gentle reader, and say that she was very easily\r\nimpressed, it may be that you have never known what it is to be hungry,\r\nnot for bread, but for human sympathy, to live with those who were never\r\ninterested in your joys, nor sympathized in your sorrows. To whom your\r\ncoming gave no joy and your absence no pain. Since Annette had lost her\r\ngrandmother, she had lived in an atmosphere of coldness and repression\r\nand was growing prematurely cold. Her heart was like a sealed fountain\r\nbeneath whose covering the bright waters dashed and leaped in imprisoned\r\nboundary. Oh, blessed power of human love to lighten human suffering,\r\nwell may we thank the giver of every good and perfect gift for the love\r\nwhich gladdens hearts, brightens homes and sets the solitary in the\r\nmidst of families. Mr. Luzerne frequently saw Annette at the house of\r\nMrs. Lasette and occasionally called at her uncle\'s, but there was an\r\nair of restraint in the social atmosphere which repressed and chilled\r\nhim. In that home he missed the cordial freedom and genial companionship\r\nwhich he always found at Mrs. Lasette\'s but Annette\'s apparent\r\nloneliness and social isolation awakened his sympathy, and her bright\r\nintelligence and good character commanded his admiration and respect,\r\nwhich developed within him a deep interest for the lovely girl. He often\r\nspoke admiringly of her and never met her at church, or among her\r\nfriends that he did not gladly avail himself of the opportunity of\r\naccompanying her home. Madame rumor soon got tidings of Mr. Luzerne\'s\r\nattentions to Annette and in a shout the tongues of the gossips of A.P.\r\nbegan to wag. Mrs. Larkins who had fallen heir to some money, moved out\r\nof Tennis court, and often gave pleasant little teas to her young\r\nfriends, and as a well spread table was quite a social attraction in\r\nA.P., her gatherings were always well attended. After rumor had caught\r\nthe news of Mr. Luzerne\'s interest in Annette, Mrs. Larkins had a social\r\nat her house to which she invited him, and a number of her young\r\nfriends, but took pains to leave Annette out in the cold. Mr. Luzerne on\r\nhearing that Annette was slighted, refused to attend. At the supper\r\ntable Annette\'s prospects were freely discussed.\r\n\r\n"I expected that Mr. Luzerne would have been here this evening, but he\r\nsent an apology in which he declined to come."\r\n\r\n"Did you invite Annette?" said Miss Croker.\r\n\r\n"No, I did not. I got enough of her when I lived next door to her."\r\n\r\n"Well that accounts for Mr. Luzerne\'s absence. They remind me of the\r\nSiamese twins; if you see one, you see the other."\r\n\r\n"How did she get in with him?"\r\n\r\n"She met him at Mrs. Lasette\'s party, and he seemed so taken up with her\r\nthat for a while he had neither eyes nor ears for any one else."\r\n\r\n"That girl, as quiet as she looks, is just as deep as the sea."\r\n\r\n"It is not that she\'s so deep, but we are so shallow. Miss Booker and\r\nMiss Croker were sitting near Annette and not noticing her, and we girls\r\nwere having a good time in the corner to ourselves, and Annette was\r\nlooking so lonely and embarrassed I think Mr. Luzerne just took pity on\r\nher and took especial pains to entertain her. I just think we stepped\r\nour feet into it by slighting Annette, and of course, as soon as we saw\r\nhim paying attention to her, we wouldn\'t change and begin to make much\r\nof her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what he sees in Annette with her big nose and plain face."\r\n\r\n"My father," said Laura Lasette, "says that Annette is a credit to her\r\nrace and my mother is just delighted because Mr. Luzerne is attracted\r\nto her, but, girls, had we not better be careful how we talk about her?\r\nPeople might say that we are jealous of her and we know that we are\r\ntaught that jealousy is as cruel as the grave."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t see anything to be jealous about her. She is neither pretty\r\nnor stylish."\r\n\r\n"But my mother says she is a remarkable girl," persisted Laura.\r\n\r\n"Your mother," said Mrs. Larkins, "always had funny notions about\r\nAnnette, and saw in her what nobody else did."\r\n\r\n"Well, for my part, I hope it will be a match."\r\n\r\n"It is easy enough for you to say so, Laura. You think it is a sure\r\nthing between you and Charley Cooper, but don\'t be too sure; there\'s\r\nmany a slip between the cup and the lip."\r\n\r\nThere was a flush on Laura\'s cheek as she replied, "If there are a\r\nthousand slips between the cup and the lip and Charlie and I should\r\nnever marry, let me tell you that I would almost as soon court another\'s\r\nhusband as a girl\'s affianced lover. I can better afford to be an old\r\nmaid than to do a dishonorable thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, Laura, you are a chip off the old block; just like your mother,\r\nalways ready to take Annette\'s part."\r\n\r\n"I think, Mrs. Larkins, it is the finest compliment you can pay me, to\r\ntell me that I am like my dear mother."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n"Good morning," said Mr. Luzerne, entering Mr. Thomas\' office. "Are you\r\nbusy?"\r\n\r\n"Not very; I had just given some directions to my foreman concerning a\r\njob I have undertaken, and had just settled down to read the paper. Well\r\nhow does your acquaintance with Miss Harcourt prosper? Have you popped\r\nthe question yet?"\r\n\r\n"No, not exactly; I had been thinking very seriously of the matter, but\r\nI have been somewhat shaken in my intention."\r\n\r\n"How so," said Mr. Thomas, laying down his paper and becoming suddenly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n"You know that I have had an unhappy marriage which has overshadowed all\r\nmy subsequent life, and I cannot help feeling very cautious how I risk,\r\nnot only my own, but another\'s happiness in a second marriage. It is\r\ntrue that I have been thinking of proposing to Miss Harcourt and I do\r\nprefer her to any young lady I have ever known; but there is a\r\ndepreciatory manner in which people speak of her, that sorely puzzles\r\nme. For instance, when I ask some young ladies if they know Annette,\r\nthey shrug their shoulders, look significantly at each other and say,\r\n\'Oh, yes, we know her; but she don\'t care for anything but books; oh she\r\nis so self conceited and thinks she knows more than any one else.\' But\r\nwhen I spoke to Mrs. Larkins about her, she said Annette makes a fine\r\nappearance, but all is not gold that glitters. By this time my curiosity\r\nwas excited, and I asked, \'What is the matter with Miss Harcourt? I had\r\nno idea that people were so ready to pick at her.\' She replied, \'No\r\nwonder; she is such a spitfire.\'"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Thomas, a little hotly, "if Annette is a spitfire, Mrs.\r\nLarkins is a lot of combustion. I think of all the women I know, she has\r\nthe greatest genius for aggravation. I used to board with her, but as I\r\ndid not wish to be talked to death I took refuge in flight."\r\n\r\n"And so you showed the white feather that time."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did, and I could show it again. I don\'t wonder that people have\r\nnick-named her \'Aunty talk forever.\' I have known Annette for years and\r\nI known that she is naturally quick tempered and impulsive, but she is\r\nnot malicious and implacable and if I were going to marry to-morrow I\r\nwould rather have a quick, hot-tempered woman than a cold, selfish one,\r\nwho never thought or cared about anyone but herself. Mrs. Larkins\' mouth\r\nis not a prayer-book; don\'t be uneasy about anything she says against\r\nAnnette."\r\n\r\nReassured by Mr. Thomas, Clarence Luzerne decided that he would ask Dr.\r\nHarcourt\'s permission to visit his niece, a request which was readily\r\ngranted and he determined if she would consent that she should be his\r\nwife. He was wealthy, handsome and intelligent; Annette was poor and\r\nplain, but upright in character and richly endowed in intellect, and no\r\none imagined that he would pass by the handsome and stylish girls of\r\nA.P. to bestow his affections on plain, neglected Annette. Some of the\r\ngirls who knew of his friendship for Annette, but who never dreamed of\r\nits termination in marriage would say to Annette, "Speak a good word for\r\nme to Mr. Luzerne;" but Annette kept her counsel and would smile and\r\nthink: I will speak a good word for myself. Very pleasant was the\r\ngrowing friendship between Annette and Mr. Luzerne. Together they read\r\nand discussed books and authors and agreed with wonderful unanimity,\r\nwhich often expressed itself in the words:\r\n\r\n"I think as you do." Not that there was any weak compliance for the sake\r\nof agreement, but a unison of thought and feeling between them which\r\ngave a pleasurable zest to their companionship.\r\n\r\n"Miss Annette," said Luzerne, "do you believe that matches are made in\r\nheaven?"\r\n\r\n"I never thought anything about it."\r\n\r\n"But have you no theory on the subject?"\r\n\r\n"Not the least; have you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think that every human soul has its counterpart, and is never\r\nsatisfied till soul has met with soul and recognized its spiritual\r\naffinity."\r\n\r\n"Affinity! I hate the word."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I think it has been so wrongly used, and added to the social\r\nmisery of the world."\r\n\r\n"What do you think marriage ought to be?"\r\n\r\n"I think it should be a blending of hearts, an intercommunion of souls,\r\na tie that only love and truth should weave, and nothing but death\r\nshould part."\r\n\r\nLuzerne listened eagerly and said, "Why, Miss Annette, you speak as if\r\nyou had either loved or were using your fine imaginative powers on the\r\nsubject with good effect. Have you ever loved any one?"\r\n\r\nAnnette blushed and stammered, and said, "I hardly know, but I think I\r\nhave a fine idea of what love should be. I think the love of a woman for\r\nthe companion of her future life should go out to him just as naturally\r\nas the waves leap to the strand, or the fire ascends to the sun."\r\n\r\n"And this," said Luzerne, taking her hand in his, "is the way I feel\r\ntowards you. Surely our souls have met at last. Annette," said he, in a\r\nvoice full of emotion, "is it not so? May I not look on your hand as a\r\nprecious possession, to hold till death us do part?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. Luzerne," said Annette, recovering from her surprise, "this is\r\nso sudden, I hardly know what to say. I have enjoyed your companionship\r\nand I confess have been pleased with your attentions, but I did not\r\ndream that you had any intentions beyond the enjoyment of the hour."\r\n\r\n"No, Annette, I never seek amusement in toying with human hearts. I\r\nshould deem myself a villain if I came into your house and stole your\r\npurse, and I should think myself no better if I entered the citadel of a\r\nwoman\'s heart to steal her affections only to waste their wealth. Her\r\nstolen money I might restore, but what reparation could I make for\r\nwasted love and blighted affections? Annette, let there be truth between\r\nus. I will give you time to think on my proposal, hoping at the same\r\ntime that I shall find favor in your eyes."\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Luzerne left, Annette, sat alone by the fireside, a delicious\r\nsense of happiness filling her soul with sudden joy. Could it be that\r\nthis handsome and dignified man had honored her above all the girls in\r\nA.P., by laying his heart at her feet, or was it only a dream from\r\nwhich would come a rude awakening? Annette looked in the glass, but no\r\nstretch of imagination could make her conceive that she was beautiful in\r\neither form or feature. She turned from the glass with a faint sigh,\r\nwishing for his sake that she was as beautiful as some of the other\r\ngirls in A.P., whom he had overlooked, not thinking for one moment that\r\nin loving her for what she was in intellect and character he had paid\r\nher a far greater compliment than if she had been magnificently\r\nbeautiful and he had only been attracted by an exquisite form and lovely\r\nface. In a few days after Mr. Luzerne\'s proposal to Annette he came for\r\nthe answer, to which he looked with hope and suspense.\r\n\r\n"I am glad," he said, "to find you at home."\r\n\r\n"Yes; all the rest of the family are out."\r\n\r\n"Then the coast is clear for me?" There was tenderness and decision in\r\nhis voice as he said, "Now, Annette, I have come for the answer which\r\ncannot fail to influence all my future life." He clasped the little hand\r\nwhich lay limp and passive in his own. His dark, handsome eyes were bent\r\neagerly upon her as if scanning every nook and corner of her soul. Her\r\neye fell beneath his gaze, her hand trembled in his, tears of joy were\r\nspringing to her eyes, but she restrained them. She withdrew her hand\r\nfrom his clasp; he looked pained and disappointed. "Have I been too\r\nhasty and presumptuous?"\r\n\r\nAnnette said no rather faintly, while her face was an enigma he did not\r\nknow how to solve.\r\n\r\n"Why did you release your hand and avert your eyes?"\r\n\r\n"I felt that my will was succumbing to yours, and I want to give you an\r\nanswer untrammeled and uncontrolled by your will."\r\n\r\nMr. Luzerne smiled, and thought what rare thoughtfulness and judgment\r\nshe has evinced. How few women older than herself would have thought as\r\nquickly and as clearly, and yet she is no less womanly, although she\r\nseems so wise.\r\n\r\n"What say you, my dear Annette, since I have released your hand. May I\r\nnot hope to hold this hand as the most precious of all my earthly\r\npossessions until death us do part?"\r\n\r\nAnnette fixed her eyes upon the floor as if she were scanning the\r\nfigures on the carpet. Her heart beat quickly as she timidly repeated\r\nthe words, "Until death us do part," and placed her hand again in his,\r\nwhile an expression of love and tender trust lit up the mobile and\r\nexpressive face, and Annette felt that his love was hers; the most\r\nprecious thing on earth that she could call her own. The engagement\r\nbeing completed, the next event in the drama was preparation for the\r\nwedding. It was intended that the engagement should not be long.\r\nTogether they visited different stores in purchasing supplies for their\r\nnew home. How pleasant was that word to the girl, who had spent such\r\nlonely hours in the home of her uncle. To her it meant one of the\r\nbrightest spots on earth and one of the fairest types of heaven. In the\r\nevening they often took pleasant strolls together or sat and chatted in\r\na beautiful park near their future home. One evening as they sat quietly\r\nenjoying themselves Annette said, "How happened it that you preferred me\r\nto all the other girls in A. P.? There are lots of girls more stylish\r\nand better looking; what did you see in poor, plain me?" He laughingly\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n  "I chose you out from all the rest,\r\n  The reason was I loved you best."\r\n\r\n"And why did you prefer me?" She answered quite archly:\r\n\r\n  "The rose is red, the violet\'s blue,\r\n  Sugar is sweet and so are you."\r\n\r\n"I chose you because of your worth. When I was young, I married for\r\nbeauty and I pierced my heart through with many sorrows."\r\n\r\n"You been married?" said Annette with a tremor in her tones. "Why, I\r\nnever heard of it before."\r\n\r\n"Did not Mr. Thomas or Mrs. Lasette tell you of it? They knew it, but it\r\nis one of the saddest passages of my life, to which I scarcely ever\r\nrefer. She, my wife, drifted from me, and was drowned in a freshet near\r\nOrleans."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how dreadful, and I never knew it."\r\n\r\n"Does it pain you?"\r\n\r\n"No, but it astonishes me."\r\n\r\n"Well, Annette, it is not a pleasant subject, let us talk of something\r\nelse. I have not spoken of it to you before, but to-day, when it pressed\r\nso painfully upon my mind, it was a relief to me to tell you about it,\r\nbut now darling dismiss it from your mind and let the dead past bury its\r\ndead."\r\n\r\nJust then there came along where they were sitting a woman whose face\r\nbore traces of great beauty, but dimmed and impaired by lines of sorrow\r\nand disappointment. Just as she reached the seat where they were\r\nsitting, she threw up her hands in sudden anguish, gasped out,\r\n"Clarence! my long lost Clarence," and fell at his feet in a dead faint.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Luzerne looked on the wretched woman lying at his feet, his face\r\ngrew deathly pale. He trembled like an aspen and murmured in a\r\nbewildered tone, "has the grave restored its dead?"\r\n\r\nBut with Annette there was no time for delay. She chaffed, the rigid\r\nhands, unloosed the closely fitting dress, sent for a cab and had her\r\nconveyed as quickly as possible to the home for the homeless. Then\r\nturning to Luzerne, she said bitterly, "Mr. Luzerne, will you explain\r\nyour encounter with that unfortunate woman?" She spoke as calmly as she\r\ncould, for a fierce and bitter anguish was biting at her heartstrings.\r\n"What claim has that woman on you?"\r\n\r\n"She has the claim of being my wife and until this hour I firmly\r\nbelieved she was in her grave." Annette lifted her eyes sadly to his;\r\nhe calmly met her gaze, but there was no deception in his glance; his\r\neyes were clear and sad and she was more puzzled than ever.\r\n\r\n"Annette," said he, "I have only one favor to ask; let this scene be a\r\nsecret between us as deep as the sea. Time will explain all. Do not\r\njudge me too harshly."\r\n\r\n"Clarence," she said, "I have faith in you, but I do not understand you;\r\nbut here is the carriage, my work at present is with this poor,\r\nunfortunate woman, whose place I was about to unconsciously supplant."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd thus they parted. All their air castles and beautiful chambers of\r\nimagery, blown to the ground by one sad cyclone of fate. In the city of\r\nA.P., a resting place was found for the stranger who had suddenly dashed\r\nfrom their lips the scarcely tasted cup of happiness. Mr. Luzerne\r\nemployed for her the best medical skill he could obtain. She was\r\nsuffering from nervous prostration and brain fever. Annette was constant\r\nin her attentions to the sufferer, and day after day listened to her\r\ndelirious ravings. Sometimes she would speak of a diamond necklace, and\r\nsay so beseechingly, "Clarence, don\'t look at me so. You surely can\'t\r\nthink that I am guilty. I will go away and hide myself from you.\r\nClarence, you never loved me or you would not believe me guilty."\r\n\r\nBut at length a good constitution and careful nursing overmastered\r\ndisease, and she showed signs of recovery. Annette watched over her when\r\nher wild ravings sounded in her ears like requiems for the loved and\r\ncherished dead. Between her and the happiness she had so fondly\r\nanticipated, stood that one blighted life, but she watched that life\r\njust as carefully as if it had been the dearest life on earth she knew.\r\n\r\nOne day, as Annette sat by her bedside, she surmised from the look on\r\nher face that the wandering reason of the sufferer had returned.\r\nBeckoning to Annette she said "Who are you and where am I?"\r\n\r\nAnnette answered, "I am your friend and you are with friends."\r\n\r\n"Poor Clarence," she murmured to herself; "more sinned against than\r\nsinning."\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," Annette said very tenderly, "you have been very ill,\r\nand I am afraid that if you do not be very quiet you will be very sick\r\nagain." Annette gently smoothed her beautiful hair and tried to soothe\r\nher into quietness. Rest and careful nursing soon wrought a wondrous\r\nchange in Marie Luzerne, but Annette thoughtfully refrained from all\r\nreference to her past history and waited for time to unravel the mystery\r\nshe could not understand, and with this unsolved mystery the match\r\nbetween her and Luzerne was broken off. At length, one day when Marie\'s\r\nhealth was nearly restored, she asked for writing materials, and said,\r\n"I mean to advertise for my mother in a Southern paper. It seems like a\r\nhorrid dream that all I knew or loved, even my husband, whom I deserted,\r\nbelieved that I was dead, till I came suddenly on him in the park with a\r\nyoung lady by his side. She looked like you. Was it you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Annette, as a sigh of relief came to her lips. If Clarence\r\nhad wooed and won her he had not willfully deceived her. "Oh, how I\r\nwould like to see him. I was wayward and young when I left him in anger.\r\nOh, if I have sinned I have suffered; but I think that I could die\r\ncontent if I could only see him once more." Annette related the strange\r\nsad story to her physician, who decided that it was safe and desirable\r\nthat there should be an interview between them. Luzerne visited his long\r\nlost wife and after a private interview, he called Annette to the room,\r\nwho listened sadly while she told her story, which exonerated Luzerne\r\nfrom all intent to deceive Annette by a false marriage while she had a\r\nlegal claim upon him.\r\n\r\n"I was born," she said, "in New Orleans. My father was a Spaniard and\r\nmy mother a French Creole. She was very beautiful and my father met her\r\nat a French ball and wished her for his companion for life, but as she\r\nwas an intelligent girl and a devout Catholic she would not consent to\r\nlive a life by which she would be denied the Sacrament of her Church; so\r\nwhile she could not contract a civil marriage, which would give her the\r\nlegal claims of a wife, she could enter into an ecclesiastical marriage\r\nby which she would not forfeit her claim to the rights and privileges of\r\nthe Church as a good Catholic. I was her only child, loved and petted by\r\nmy father, and almost worshipped by my mother, and I never knew what it\r\nwas to have a wish unfilled if it was in her power to gratify it. When I\r\nwas about 16 I met Clarence Luzerne. People then said that I was very\r\nbeautiful. You would scarcely think so now, but I suppose he thought so,\r\ntoo. In a short time we were married, and soon saw that we were utterly\r\nunfitted to each other; he was grave and I was gay; he was careful and\r\nindustrious, I was careless and extravagant; he loved the quiet of his\r\nhome and books; I loved the excitements of pleasure and the ball room,\r\nand yet I think he loved me, but it was as a father might love a wayward\r\nchild whom he vainly tried to restrain. I had a cousin who had been\r\nabsent from New Orleans a number of years, of whose antecedents I knew\r\nnot scarcely anything. He was lively, handsome and dashing. My husband\r\ndid not like his society, and objected to my associating with him. I did\r\nnot care particularly for him, but I chafed against the restraint, and\r\nin sheer waywardness I continued the association. One day he brought me\r\na beautiful diamond necklace which he said he had obtained in a distant\r\nland. I laid it aside intending to show it to my husband; in the\r\nmeantime, a number of burglaries had been committed in the city of B.,\r\nand among them was a diamond necklace. My heart stood still with sudden\r\nfear while I read of the account and while I was resolving what to do,\r\nmy husband entered the house followed by two officers, who demanded the\r\nnecklace. My husband interfered and with a large sum of money obtained\r\nmy freedom from arrest. My husband was very proud of the honor of his\r\nfamily and blamed me for staining its record. From that day my husband\r\nseemed changed in his feelings towards me. He grew cold, distant and\r\nabstracted, and I felt that my presence was distasteful to him. I could\r\nnot enter into his life and I saw that he had no sympathy with mine, and\r\nso in a fit of desperation I packed my trunk and took with me some money\r\nI had inherited from my father and left, as I said in a note, forever. I\r\nentered a convent and resolved that I would devote myself to the service\r\nof the poor and needy, for life had lost its charms for me. I had\r\nscarcely entered the convent before the yellow fever broke out and raged\r\nwith fearful intensity. I was reckless of my life and engaged myself as\r\na nurse. One day there came to our hospital a beautiful girl with a\r\nwealth of raven hair just like mine was before I became a nurse. I\r\nnursed her through a tedious illness and when she went out from the\r\nhospital, as I had an abundance of clothing, I supplied her from my\r\nwardrobe with all she needed, even to the dress she wore away. The\r\nclothing was all marked with my name. Soon after I saw in the paper that\r\na young woman who was supposed from the marks on her clothing and the\r\ngeneral description of her person to be myself was found drowned in a\r\nfreshet. I was taken ill immediately afterwards and learned on\r\nrecovering that I had been sick and delirious for several weeks. I\r\nsought for my mother, inquired about my husband, but lost all trace of\r\nthem both till I suddenly came across my husband in Brightside Park. But\r\nClarence, if you have formed other ties don\'t let me come between you\r\nand the sunshine. You are free to apply for a divorce; you can make the\r\nplea of willful desertion. I will not raise the least straw in your way.\r\nI will go back to the convent and spend the rest of my life in penitence\r\nand prayer. I have sinned; it is right that I should suffer." Clarence\r\nlooked eagerly into the face of Annette; it was calm and peaceful, but\r\nin it he read no hope of a future reunion.\r\n\r\n"What say you, Annette, would you blame me if I accepted this release?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly would. She is your lawful wife. In the church of her father\r\nyou pledged your faith to her, and I do not think any human law can\r\nabsolve you from being faithful to your marriage vows. I do not say it\r\nlightly. I do not think any mother ever laid her first born in the grave\r\nwith any more sorrow than I do to-day when I make my heart the sepulchre\r\nin which I bury my first and only love. This, Clarence, is the saddest\r\ntrial of my life. I am sadder to-day than when I stood a lonely orphan\r\nover my grandmother\'s grave, and heard the clods fall on her coffin and\r\nstood lonely and heart-stricken in my uncle\'s house, and felt that I was\r\nunwelcome there. But, Clarence, the great end of life is not the\r\nattainment of happiness but the performance of duty and the development\r\nof character. The great question is not what is pleasant but what is\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Annette, I feel that you are right; but I am too wretched to realize\r\nthe force of what you say. I only know that we must part, and that means\r\nbinding my heart as a bleeding sacrifice on the altar of duty."\r\n\r\n"Do you not know who drank the cup of human suffering to its bitter\r\ndregs before you? Arm yourself with the same mind, learn to suffer and\r\nbe strong. Yes, we must part; but if we are faithful till death heaven\r\nwill bring us sweeter rest." And thus they parted. If Luzerne had felt\r\nany faltering in his allegiance to duty he was too honorable and upright\r\nwhen that duty was plainly shown to him to weakly shrink from its\r\nperformance, and as soon as his wife was able to travel he left A.P.,\r\nfor a home in the sunny South. After Luzerne had gone Annette thought,\r\n"I must have some active work which will engross my mind and use every\r\nfaculty of my soul. I will consult with my dear friend Mrs. Lasette."\r\n\r\nAll unnerved by her great trial, Annette rang Mrs. Lasette\'s front door\r\nbell somewhat hesitatingly and walked wearily into the sitting-room,\r\nwhere she found Mrs. Lasette resting in the interval between twilight\r\nand dark. "Why Annette!" she said with pleased surprise, "I am so glad\r\nto see you. How is Clarence? I thought you would have been married\r\nbefore now. I have your wedding present all ready for you."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lasette," Annette said, while her voice trembled with\r\ninexpressible sorrow, "it is all over."\r\n\r\nMrs. Lasette was lighting the lamp and had not seen Annette\'s face in\r\nthe dusk of the evening, but she turned suddenly around at the sound of\r\nher voice and noticed the wan face so pitiful in its expression of\r\nintense suffering.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, my dear; have you and Luzerne had a lover\'s\r\nquarrel?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Annette, sadly, and then in the ears of her sympathizing\r\nfriend she poured her tale of bitter disappointment. Mrs. Lasette folded\r\nthe stricken girl to her heart in tenderest manner.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Lasette," she said, "you make me feel how good it is for girls\r\nto have a mother."\r\n\r\n"Annette, my brave, my noble girl, I am so glad."\r\n\r\n"Glad of what, Mrs. Lasette?"\r\n\r\n"Glad that you have been so true to conscience and to duty; glad that\r\nyou have come through your trial like gold tried in the fiercest fire;\r\nglad that my interest in you has not been in vain, and that I have been\r\nable to see the blessed fruitage of my love and labors. And now, my dear\r\nchild, what next?"\r\n\r\n"I must have a change; I must find relief in action. I feel so weak and\r\nbruised in heart."\r\n\r\n"A bruised reed will not break," murmured Mrs. Lasette to herself.\r\n\r\n"Annette," said Mrs. Lasette, "this has been a fearful trial, but it\r\nmust not be in vain; let it bring you more than happiness; let it bring\r\nyou peace and blessedness. There is only one place for us to bring our\r\nsins and our sorrows, and that is the mercy seat. Let us both kneel\r\nthere to-night and ask for grace to help in this your time of need. We\r\nare taught to cast our care upon Him for he careth for us. Come, my\r\nchild, with the spirit of submission and full surrender, and consecrate\r\nyour life to his service, body, soul and spirit, not as a dead offering,\r\nbut a living sacrifice."\r\n\r\nTogether they mingled their prayers and tears, and when Annette rose\r\nfrom her knees there was a look of calmness on her face, and a deep\r\npeace had entered her soul. The strange trial was destined to bring joy\r\nand gladness and yield the peaceable fruit of righteousness in the\r\nfuture. Mrs. Lasette wrote to some friends in a distant Southern town\r\nwhere she obtained a situation for Annette as a teacher. Here she soon\r\nfound work to enlist her interest and sympathy and bring out all the\r\nactivity of her soul. She had found her work and the people among whom\r\nshe labored had found their faithful friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\n\r\nLuzerne\'s failure to marry Annette and re-instatement of his wife was\r\nthe sensation of the season. Some pitied Annette; others blamed Luzerne,\r\nbut Annette found, as a teacher, opportunity among the freedmen to be a\r\nfriend and sister to those whose advantages had been less than hers.\r\nLife had once opened before her like a fair vision enchanted with\r\ndelight, but her beautiful dream had faded like sun rays mingling with\r\nthe shadows of night. It was the great disappointment of her life, but\r\nshe roused up her soul to bear suffering and to be true to duty, and\r\ninto her soul came a joy which was her strength. Little children learned\r\nto love her, the street gamins knew her as their friend, aged women\r\nblessed the dear child as they called her, who planned for their comfort\r\nwhen the blasts of winter were raging around their homes. Before her\r\ngreat trial she had found her enjoyment more in her intellectual than\r\nspiritual life, but when every earthly prop was torn away, she learned\r\nto lean her fainting head on Christ the corner-stone and the language of\r\nher heart was "Nearer to thee, e\'en though it be a cross that raiseth\r\nme." In surrendering her life she found a new life and more abundant\r\nlife in every power and faculty of her soul.\r\n\r\nLuzerne went South and found Marie\'s mother who had mourned her child as\r\ndead. Tenderly they watched over her, but the seeds of death were sown\r\ntoo deeply in her wasted frame for recovery, and she wasted away and\r\nsank into a premature grave, leaving Luzerne the peaceful satisfaction\r\nof having smoothed her passage to the grave, and lengthened with his\r\ncare, her declining days. Turning from her grave he plunged into active\r\nlife. It was during the days of reconstruction when tricksters and\r\ndemagogues were taking advantage of the ignorance and inexperience of\r\nthe newly enfranchised citizens. Honorable and upright, Luzerne\r\npreserved his integrity among the corruptions of political life. Men\r\nrespected him too much to attempt to swerve him from duty for personal\r\nadvantage. No bribes ever polluted his hands, nor fraud, nor political\r\nchicanery ever stained his record.\r\n\r\nHe was the friend and benefactor of his race, giving them what gold is\r\never too poor to buy--the benefit of a good example and a noble life,\r\nand earned for himself the sobriquet by which he was called, "honest\r\nLuzerne." And yet at times he would turn wistfully to Annette and the\r\nmemory of those glad, bright days when he expected to clasp hands with\r\nher for life. At length his yearning had become insatiable and he\r\nreturned to A. P.\r\n\r\nLaura Lasette had married Charley Cooper who by patience and industry\r\nhad obtained a good position in the store of a merchant who was manly\r\nenough to let it be known that he had Negro blood in his veins, but that\r\nhe intended to give him a desk and place in his establishment and he\r\ntold his employees that he intended to employ him, and if they were not\r\nwilling to work with him they could leave. Charley was promoted just the\r\nsame as others according to his merits. Time had dealt kindly with Mrs.\r\nLasette, as he scattered his silvery crystals amid her hair, and of her\r\nit might be said,\r\n\r\n  Each silver hair, each wrinkle there\r\n    Records some good deed done,\r\n  Some flower she scattered by the way\r\n    Some spark from love\'s bright sun.\r\n\r\nMrs. Larkins had grown kinder and more considerate as the years passed\r\nby. Mr. Thomas had been happily married for several years. Annette was\r\nstill in her Southern home doing what she could to teach, help and\r\nbefriend those on whose chains the rust of ages had gathered. Mr.\r\nLuzerne found out Annette\'s location and started Southward with a fresh\r\nhope springing up in his heart.\r\n\r\nIt was a balmy day in the early spring when he reached the city where\r\nAnnette was teaching. Her home was a beautiful place of fragrance and\r\nflowers. Groups of young people were gathered around their teacher\r\nlistening eagerly to a beautiful story she was telling them. Elderly\r\nwomen were scattered in little companies listening to or relating some\r\nstory of Annette\'s kindness to them and their children.\r\n\r\n"I told her," said one, "that I had a vision that some one who was fair,\r\nwas coming to help us. She smiled and said she was not fair. I told her\r\nshe was fair to me."\r\n\r\n"I wish she had been here fifteen years ago," said another one. "Before\r\nshe came my boy was just as wild as a colt, but now he is jist as stiddy\r\nas a judge."\r\n\r\n"I just think," said another one, "that she has been the making of my\r\nLucy. She\'s just wrapped up in Miss Annette, thinks the sun rises and\r\nsets in her." Old mothers whose wants had been relieved, came with the\r\nchildren and younger men too, to celebrate Annette\'s 31st birthday.\r\nHappy and smiling, like one who had passed through suffering into peace\r\nshe stood, the beloved friend of old and young, when suddenly she heard\r\na footstep on the veranda which sent the blood bounding in swift\r\ncurrents back to her heart and left her cheek very pale. It was years\r\nsince she had heard the welcome rebound of that step, but it seemed as\r\nfamiliar to her as the voice of a loved and long lost friend, or a\r\nprecious household word, and before her stood, with slightly bowed form\r\nand hair tinged with gray, Luzerne. Purified through suffering, which to\r\nhim had been an evangel of good, he had come to claim the love of his\r\nspirit. He had come not to separate her from her cherished life work,\r\nbut to help her in uplifting and helping those among whom her lot was\r\ncast as a holy benediction, and so after years of trial and pain, their\r\nsouls had met at last, strengthened by duty, purified by that faith\r\nwhich works by love, and fitted for life\'s highest and holiest truths.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in conclusion, permit me to say under the guise of fiction, I\r\nhave essayed to weave a story which I hope will subserve a deeper\r\npurpose than the mere amusement of the hour, that it will quicken and\r\ninvigorate human hearts and not fail to impart a lesson of usefulness\r\nand value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n\r\n'
