Yonge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of a warm day in the end of July, an open carriage was\r\nwaiting in front of the painted toy-looking building which served as\r\nthe railway station of Teignmouth. The fine bay horses stood patiently\r\nenduring the attacks of hosts of winged foes, too well-behaved to\r\nexpress their annoyance otherwise than by twitchings of their sleek\r\nshining skins, but duly grateful to the coachman, who roused himself now\r\nand then to whisk off some more pertinacious tormentor with the end of\r\nhis whip.\r\n\r\nLess patient was the sole occupant of the carriage, a maiden of about\r\nsixteen years of age, whose shady dark grey eyes, parted lips, and\r\nflushed complexion, were all full of the utmost eagerness, as every two\r\nor three minutes she looked up from the book which she held in her hand\r\nto examine the clock over the station door, compare it with her watch,\r\nand study the countenances of the bystanders to see whether they\r\nexpressed any anxiety respecting the non-arrival of the train. All,\r\nhowever, seemed quite at their ease, and after a time the arrival of the\r\nrailway omnibus and two or three other carriages, convinced her that the\r\nrest of the world only now began to consider it to be due. At last the\r\nringing of a bell quickened everybody into a sudden state of activity,\r\nand assured her that the much-desired moment was come. The cloud of\r\nsmoke was seen, the panting of the engine was heard, the train displayed\r\nits length before the station, men ran along tapping the doors of the\r\ncarriages, and shouting a word which bore some distant resemblance to\r\n"Teignmouth," and at the same moment various travellers emerged from the\r\ndifferent vehicles.\r\n\r\nHer eye eagerly sought out one of these arrivals, who on his side, after\r\na hasty greeting to the servant who met him on the platform, hurried to\r\nthe carriage, and sprang into it. The two faces, exactly alike in form,\r\ncomplexion, and features, were for one moment pressed together, then\r\nwithdrawn, in the consciousness of the publicity of the scene, but the\r\nhands remained locked together, and earnest was the tone of the "Well,\r\nFred!" "Well, Henrietta!" which formed the greeting of the twin brother\r\nand sister.\r\n\r\n"And was not mamma well enough to come?" asked Frederick, as the\r\ncarriage turned away from the station.\r\n\r\n"She was afraid of the heat. She had some business letters to write\r\nyesterday, which teased her, and she has not recovered from them yet;\r\nbut she has been very well, on the whole, this summer. But what of your\r\nschool affairs, Fred? How did the examination go off?"\r\n\r\n"I am fourth, and Alex Langford fifth. Every one says the prize will lie\r\nbetween us next year."\r\n\r\n"Surely," said Henrietta, "you must be able to beat him then, if you are\r\nbefore him now."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make too sure, Henrietta," said Frederick, shaking his head,\r\n"Langford is a hard-working fellow, very exact and accurate; I should\r\nnot have been before him now if it had not been for my verses."\r\n\r\n"I know Beatrice is very proud of Alexander," said Henrietta, "she would\r\nmake a great deal of his success."\r\n\r\n"Why of his more than of that of any other cousin?" said Frederick with\r\nsome dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n"O you know he is the only one of the Knight Sutton cousins whom she\r\npatronizes; all the others she calls cubs and bears and Osbaldistones.\r\nAnd indeed, Uncle Geoffrey says he thinks it was in great part owing to\r\nher that Alex is different from the rest. At least he began to think\r\nhim worth cultivating from the time he found him and Busy Bee perched\r\nup together in an apple-tree, she telling him the story of Alexander the\r\nGreat. And how she always talks about Alex when she is here."\r\n\r\n"Is she at Knight Sutton?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Aunt Geoffrey would not come here, because she did not wish to\r\nbe far from London, because old Lady Susan has not been well. And only\r\nthink, Fred, Queen Bee says there is a very nice house to be let close\r\nto the village, and they went to look at it with grandpapa, and he kept\r\non saying how well it would do for us."\r\n\r\n"O, if we could but get mamma there!" said Fred. "What does she say?"\r\n\r\n"She knows the house, and says it is a very pleasant one," said\r\nHenrietta; "but that is not an inch--no, not the hundredth part of an\r\ninch--towards going there!"\r\n\r\n"It would surely be a good thing for her if she could but be brought\r\nto believe so," said Frederick. "All her attachments are there--her own\r\nhome; my father\'s home."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing but the sea to be attached to, here," said\r\nHenrietta. "Nobody can take root without some local interest, and as to\r\nacquaintance, the people are always changing."\r\n\r\n"And there is nothing to do," added Fred; "nothing possible but boating\r\nand riding, which are not worth the misery which they cause her, as\r\nUncle Geoffrey says. It is very, very--"\r\n\r\n"Aggravating," said Henrietta, supplying one of the numerous stock of\r\nfamily slang words.\r\n\r\n"Yes, aggravating," said he with a smile, "to be placed under the\r\nnecessity of being absurd, or of annoying her!"\r\n\r\n"Annoying! O, Fred, you do not know a quarter of what she goes through\r\nwhen she thinks you are in any danger. It could not be worse if you were\r\non the field of battle! And it is very strange, for she is not at all a\r\ntimid person for herself. In the boat, that time when the wind rose, I\r\nam sure Aunt Geoffrey was more afraid than she was, and I have seen it\r\nagain and again that she is not easily frightened."\r\n\r\n"No: and I do not think she is afraid for you."\r\n\r\n"Not as she is for you, Fred; but then boys are so much more precious\r\nthan girls, and besides they love to endanger themselves so much, that I\r\nthink that is reasonable."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Geoffrey thinks there is something nervous and morbid in it,"\r\nsaid Fred: "he thinks that it is the remains of the horror of the sudden\r\nshock--"\r\n\r\n"What? Our father\'s accident?" asked Henrietta. "I never knew rightly\r\nabout that. I only knew it was when we were but a week old."\r\n\r\n"No one saw it happen," said Fred; "he went out riding, his horse came\r\nhome without him, and he was lying by the side of the road."\r\n\r\n"Did they bring him home?" asked Henrietta, in the same low thrilling\r\ntone in which her brother spoke.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he never recovered his senses: he just said \'Mary,\' once or\r\ntwice, and only lived to the middle of the night!"\r\n\r\n"Terrible!" said Henrietta, with a shudder. "O! how did mamma ever\r\nrecover it?--at least, I do not think she has recovered it now,--but I\r\nmeant live, or be even as well as she is."\r\n\r\n"She was fearfully ill for long after," said Fred, "and Uncle Geoffrey\r\nthinks that these anxieties for me are an effect of the shock. He says\r\nthey are not at all like her usual character. I am sure it is not to be\r\nwondered at."\r\n\r\n"O no, no," said Henrietta. "What a mystery it has always seemed to us\r\nabout papa! She sometimes mentioning him in talking about her childish\r\ndays and Knight Sutton, but if we tried to ask any more, grandmamma\r\nstopping us directly, till we learned to believe we ought never to utter\r\nhis name. I do believe, though, that mamma herself would have found it a\r\ncomfort to talk to us about him, if poor dear grandmamma had not always\r\ncut her short, for fear it should be too much for her."\r\n\r\n"But had you not always an impression of something dreadful about his\r\ndeath?"\r\n\r\n"O yes, yes; I do not know how we acquired it, but that I am sure we\r\nhad, and it made us shrink from asking any questions, or even from\r\ntalking to each other about it. All I knew I heard from Beatrice. Did\r\nUncle Geoffrey tell you this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he told me when he was here last Easter, and I was asking him to\r\nspeak to mamma about my fishing, and saying how horrid it was to be kept\r\nback from everything. First he laughed, and said it was the penalty of\r\nbeing an only son, and then he entered upon this history, to show me how\r\nit is."\r\n\r\n"But it is very odd that she should have let you learn to ride, which\r\none would have thought she would have dreaded most of all."\r\n\r\n"That was because she thought it right, he says. Poor mamma, she said\r\nto him, \'Geoffrey, if you think it right that Fred should begin to\r\nride, never mind my folly.\' He says that he thinks it cost her as much\r\nresolution to say that as it might to be martyred. And the same about\r\ngoing to school."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; exactly," said Henrietta, "if she thinks it is right, bear it\r\nshe will, cost her what it may! O there is nobody like mamma. Busy Bee\r\nsays so, and she knows, living in London and seeing so many people as\r\nshe does."\r\n\r\n"I never saw anyone so like a queen," said Fred. "No, nor anyone so\r\nbeautiful, though she is so pale and thin. People say you are like her\r\nin her young days, Henrietta; and to be sure, you have a decent face of\r\nyour own, but you will never be as beautiful as mamma, not if you live\r\nto be a hundred."\r\n\r\n"You are afraid to compliment my face because it is so like your own,\r\nMaster Fred," retorted his sister; "but one comfort is, that I shall\r\ngrow more like her by living to a hundred, whereas you will lose all\r\nthe little likeness you have, and grow a grim old Black-beard! But I was\r\ngoing to say, Fred, that, though I think there is a great deal of truth\r\nin what Uncle Geoffrey said, yet I do believe that poor grandmamma made\r\nit worse. You know she had always been in India, and knew less about\r\nboys than mamma, who had been brought up with papa and my uncles, so\r\nshe might really believe that everything was dangerous; and I have\r\noften seen her quite as much alarmed, or more perhaps, about you--her\r\nconsolations just showing that she was in a dreadful fright, and making\r\nmamma twice as bad."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Fred, sighing, "that is all over now, and she thought she\r\nwas doing it all for the best."\r\n\r\n"And," proceeded Henrietta, "I think, and Queen Bee thinks, that this\r\nperpetual staying on at Rocksand was more owing to her than to mamma.\r\nShe imagined that mamma could not bear the sight of Knight Sutton, and\r\nthat it was a great kindness to keep her from thinking of moving--"\r\n\r\n"Ay, and that nobody can doctor her but Mr. Clarke," added Fred.\r\n\r\n"Till now, I really believe," said Henrietta, "that the possibility of\r\nmoving has entirely passed out of her mind, and she no more believes\r\nthat she can do it than that the house can."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Fred, "I do not think a journey occurs to her among events\r\npossible, and yet without being very fond of this place."\r\n\r\n"Fond! O no! it never was meant to be a home, and has nothing homelike\r\nabout it! All her affections are really at Knight Sutton, and if she\r\nonce went there, she would stay and be so much happier among her own\r\nfriends, instead of being isolated here with me. In grandmamma\'s time\r\nit was not so bad for her, but now she has no companion at all but me.\r\nRocksand has all the loneliness of the country without its advantages."\r\n\r\n"There is not much complaint as to happiness, after all," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"No, O no! but then it is she who makes it delightful, and it cannot be\r\nwell for her to have no one to depend upon but me. Besides, how useless\r\none is here. No opportunity of doing anything for the poor people, no\r\nclergyman who will put one into the way of being useful. O how nice it\r\nwould be at Knight Sutton!"\r\n\r\n"And perhaps she would be cured of her fears," added Fred; "she would\r\nfind no one to share them, and be convinced by seeing that the cousins\r\nthere come to no harm. I wish Uncle Geoffrey would recommend it!"\r\n\r\n"Well, we will see what we can do," said Henrietta. "I do think we may\r\npersuade her, and I think we ought; it would be for her happiness and\r\nfor yours, and on all accounts I am convinced that it ought to be done."\r\n\r\nAnd as Henrietta came to this serious conclusion, they entered the steep\r\nstraggling street of the little town of Rocksand, and presently were\r\nwithin the gates of the sweep which led to the door of the verandahed\r\nGothic cottage, which looked very tempting for summer\'s lodging, but was\r\nlittle fitted for a permanent abode.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the longing wishes expressed during the drive, no\r\nancestral home, beloved by inheritance, could have been entered with\r\nmore affectionate rapture than that with which Frederick Langford sprung\r\nfrom the carriage, and flew to the arms of his mother, receiving and\r\nreturning such a caress as could only be known by a boy conscious that\r\nhe had done nothing to forfeit home love and confidence.\r\n\r\nTurning back the fair hair that hung over his forehead, Mrs. Langford\r\nlooked into his eyes, saying, half-interrogatively, half-affirmatively,\r\n"All right, Fred? Nothing that we need be afraid to tell Uncle Geoffrey?\r\nWell, Henrietta, he is grown, but he has not passed you yet. And now,\r\nFreddy, tell us about your examination," added she, as fondly leaning on\r\nhis arm, she proceeded into the drawing-room, and they sat down together\r\non the sofa, talking eagerly and joyously.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick Henry Langford, to give her her proper style, was in\r\ntruth one whose peculiar loveliness of countenance well deserved the\r\nadmiration expressed by her son. It was indeed pale and thin, but the\r\nfeatures were beautifully formed, and had that expression of sweet\r\nplacid resignation which would have made a far plainer face beautiful.\r\nThe eyes were deep dark blue, and though sorrow and suffering had dimmed\r\ntheir brightness, their softness was increased; the smile was one of\r\npeace, of love, of serenity; of one who, though sorrow-stricken, as it\r\nwere, before her time, had lived on in meek patience and submission,\r\nalmost a child in her ways, as devoted to her mother, as little with\r\na will and way of her own, as free from the cares of this work-a-day\r\nworld. The long luxuriant dark brown hair, which once, as now with\r\nHenrietta, had clustered in thick glossy ringlets over her comb and\r\nround her face, was in thick braids beneath the delicate lace cap which\r\nsuited with her plain black silk dress. Her figure was slender, so tall\r\nthat neither her well-grown son nor daughter had yet reached her height,\r\nand, as Frederick said, with something queenlike in its unconscious\r\ngrace and dignity.\r\n\r\nAs a girl she had been the merriest of the merry, and even now she had\r\ngreat playfulness of manner, and threw herself into the occupation of\r\nthe moment with a life and animation that gave an uncommon charm to\r\nher manners, so that how completely sorrow had depressed and broken her\r\nspirit would scarcely have been guessed by one who had not known her in\r\nearlier days.\r\n\r\nFrederick\'s account of his journey and of his school news was heard and\r\ncommented on, a work of time extending far into the dinner; the next\r\nmatter in the regular course of conversation on the day of arrival\r\nwas to talk over Uncle and Aunt Geoffrey\'s proceedings, and the Knight\r\nSutton affairs.\r\n\r\n"So, Uncle Geoffrey has been in the North?" said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Yes, on a special retainer," said Mrs. Langford, "and very much he\r\nseems to have enjoyed his chance of seeing York Cathedral."\r\n\r\n"He wrote to me in court," said Fred, "to tell me what books I had\r\nbetter get up for this examination, and on a bit of paper scribbled\r\nall over one side with notes of the evidence. He said the Cathedral was\r\nbeautiful beyond all he ever imagined."\r\n\r\n"Had he never seen it before?" said Henrietta. "Lawyers seem made to\r\ntravel in their vacations."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Geoffrey could not be spared," said her mamma; "I do not know\r\nwhat Grandmamma Langford would do if he cheated her of any more of his\r\nholidays than he bestows upon us. He is far too valuable to be allowed\r\nto take his own pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Besides, his own pleasure is at Knight Sutton," said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"He goes home just as he used from school," said Mrs. Langford. "Indeed,\r\nexcept a few grey hairs and crows feet, he is not in the least altered\r\nfrom those days; his work and play come in just the same way."\r\n\r\n"And, as his daughter says, he is just as much the home pet," added\r\nHenrietta, "only rivalled by Busy Bee herself."\r\n\r\n"No," said Fred, "according to Aunt Geoffrey, there are two suns in one\r\nsphere: Queen Bee is grandpapa\'s pet, Uncle Geoffrey grandmamma\'s. It\r\nmust be great fun to see them."\r\n\r\n"Happy people!" said Mrs. Langford.\r\n\r\n"Henrietta says," proceeded Fred, "that there is a house to be let at\r\nKnight Sutton."\r\n\r\n"The Pleasance; yes, I know it well," said his mother: "it is not\r\nactually in the parish, but close to the borders, and a very pretty\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"With a pretty little stream in the garden, Fred, "said Henrietta, "and\r\nlooking into that beautiful Sussex coom, that there is a drawing of in\r\nmamma\'s room."\r\n\r\n"What size is it?" added Fred.\r\n\r\n"The comparative degree," said Mrs. Langford, "but my acquaintance\r\nwith it does not extend beyond the recollection of a pretty-looking\r\ndrawing-room with French windows, and a lawn where I used to be allowed\r\nto run about when I went with Grandmamma Langford to call on the old\r\nMiss Drakes. I wonder your Uncle Roger does not take it, for those boys\r\ncan scarcely, I should think, be wedged into Sutton Leigh when they are\r\nall at home."\r\n\r\n"I wish some one else would take it," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Some one," added Henrietta, "who would like it of all things, and be\r\nquite at home there."\r\n\r\n"A person," proceeded the boy, "who likes Knight Sutton and its\r\ninhabitants better than anything else."\r\n\r\n"Only think," joined in the young lady, "how delightful it would be. I\r\ncan just fancy you, mamma, sitting out on this lawn you talk of, on a\r\nsummer\'s day, and nursing your pinks and carnations, and listening to\r\nthe nightingales, and Grandpapa and Grandmamma Langford, and Uncle\r\nand Aunt Roger, and the cousins coming walking in at any time without\r\nringing at the door! And how nice to have Queen Bee and Uncle and Aunt\r\nGeoffrey all the vacation!"\r\n\r\n"Without feeling as if we were robbing Knight Sutton," said Mrs.\r\nLangford. "Why, we should have you a regular little country maid,\r\nHenrietta, riding shaggy ponies, and scrambling over hedges, as your\r\nmamma did before you."\r\n\r\n"And being as happy as a queen," said Henrietta; "and the poor people,\r\nyou know them all, don\'t you, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"I know their names, but my generation must have nearly passed away. But\r\nI should like you to see old Daniels the carpenter, whom the boys used\r\nto work with, and who was so fond of them. And the old schoolmistress\r\nin her spectacles. How she must be scandalized by the introduction of a\r\nnoun and a verb!"\r\n\r\n"Who has been so cruel?" asked Fred. "Busy Bee, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henrietta, "she teaches away with all her might; but she\r\nsays she is afraid they will forget it all while she is in London, for\r\nthere is no one to keep it up. Now, I could do that nicely. How I should\r\nlike to be Queen Bee\'s deputy."\r\n\r\n"But," said Fred, "how does Beatrice manage to make grandmamma endure\r\nsuch novelties? I should think she would disdain them more than the old\r\nmistress herself."\r\n\r\n"Queen Bee\'s is not merely a nominal sovereignty," said Mrs. Langford.\r\n\r\n"Besides," said Henrietta, "the new Clergyman approves of all that sort\r\nof thing; he likes her to teach, and puts her in the way of it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward everything tended towards Knight Sutton: castles\r\nin the air, persuasions, casual words which showed the turn of thought\r\nof the brother and sister, met their mother every hour. Nor was she, as\r\nHenrietta truly said, entirely averse to the change; she loved to talk\r\nof what she still regarded as her home, but the shrinking dread of the\r\npang it must give to return to the scene of her happiest days, to the\r\nburial-place of her husband, to the abode of his parents, had been\r\naugmented by the tender over-anxious care of her mother, Mrs. Vivian,\r\nwho had strenuously endeavoured to prevent her from ever taking such a\r\nproposal into consideration, and fairly led her at length to believe it\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nA removal would in fact have been impossible during the latter years of\r\nMrs. Vivian\'s life: but she had now been dead about eighteen months, her\r\ndaughter had recovered from the first grief of her loss, and there was\r\na general impression throughout the family that now was the time for\r\nher to come amongst them again. For herself, the possibility was but\r\nbeginning to dawn upon her; just at first she joined in building castles\r\nand imagining scenes at Knight Sutton, without thinking of their being\r\nrealized, or that it only depended upon her, to find herself at home\r\nthere; and when Frederick and Henrietta, encouraged by this manner of\r\ntalking, pressed it upon her, she would reply with some vague intention\r\nof a return some time or other, but still thinking of it as something\r\nfar away, and rather to be dreaded than desired.\r\n\r\nIt was chiefly by dint of repetition that it fully entered her mind\r\nthat it was their real and earnest wish that she should engage to take\r\na lease of the Pleasance, and remove almost immediately from her present\r\nabode; and from this time it might be perceived that she always shrank\r\nfrom entering on the subject in a manner which gave them little reason\r\nto hope.\r\n\r\n"Yet, I think," said Henrietta to her brother one afternoon as they\r\nwere walking together on the sands; "I think if she once thought it was\r\nright, if Uncle Geoffrey would tell her so, or if grandpapa would really\r\ntell her that he wished it, I am quite sure that she would resolve upon\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"But why did he not do so long ago?" said Fred.\r\n\r\n"O! because of grandmamma, I suppose," said Henrietta; "but he really\r\ndoes wish it, and I should not at all wonder if the Busy Bee could put\r\nit into his head to do it."\r\n\r\n"Or if Uncle Geoffrey would advise her," said Fred; "but it never\r\nanswers to try to make him propose anything to her. He never will do it;\r\nhe always says he is not the Pope, or something to that effect."\r\n\r\n"If I was not fully convinced that it was right, and the best for all\r\nparties, I would not say so much about it," said Henrietta, in a tone\r\nrather as if she was preparing for some great sacrifice, instead of\r\ndomineering over her mother.\r\n\r\nTo domineering, her temptation was certainly great. With all her good\r\nsense and ability, Mrs. Langford had seldom been called upon to decide\r\nfor herself, but had always relied upon her mother for counsel; and\r\nduring her long and gradual decline had learnt to depend upon her\r\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Geoffrey Langford, for direction in great affairs,\r\nand in lesser ones upon her children. Girls are generally older of their\r\nage than boys, and Henrietta, a clever girl and her mother\'s constant\r\ncompanion, occupied a position in the family which amounted to something\r\nmore than prime minister. Some one person must always be leader, and\r\nthus she had gradually attained, or had greatness thrust upon her; for\r\njustice requires it to be stated, that she more frequently tried to know\r\nher mamma\'s mind for her, than to carry her own point, though perhaps to\r\ndo so always was more than could be expected of human nature at sixteen.\r\nThe habit of being called on to settle whether they should use the\r\nbritska or the pony carriage, whether satin or silk was best, or this or\r\nthat book should be ordered, was, however, sufficient to make her very\r\nunwilling to be thwarted in other matters of more importance, especially\r\nin one on which were fixed the most ardent hopes of her brother, and the\r\nwishes of all the family.\r\n\r\nTheir present abode was, as she often said to herself, not the one best\r\ncalculated for the holiday sports of a boy of sixteen, yet Frederick,\r\nhaving been used to nothing else, was very happy, and had tastes formed\r\non their way of life. The twins, as little children, had always had the\r\nsame occupations, Henrietta learning Latin, marbles, and trap-ball, and\r\nFrederick playing with dolls and working cross-stitch; and even now the\r\ncustom was so far continued, that he gave lessons in Homer and Euclid\r\nfor those which he received in Italian and music. For present amusement\r\nthere was no reason to complain; the neighbourhood supplied many\r\nbeautiful walks, while longer expeditions were made with Mrs. Langford\r\nin the pony carriage, and sketching, botanizing, and scrambling, were\r\nthe order of the day. Boating too was a great delight, and had it not\r\nbeen for an occasional fretting recollection that he could not go out\r\nsailing without his mamma, and that most of his school fellows were\r\nspending their holidays in a very different manner, he would have been\r\nperfectly happy. Fortunately he had not sufficient acquaintance with the\r\nboys in the neighbourhood for the contrast to be often brought before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHenrietta did not do much to reconcile him to the anxious care\r\nwith which he was guarded. She was proud of his talents, of his\r\naccomplishments, of his handsome features, and she would willingly have\r\nbeen proud of his excellence in manly sports, but in lieu of this she\r\nwas proud of the spirit which made him long for them, and encouraged it\r\nby her full and entire sympathy. The belief that the present restraints\r\nmust be diminished at Knight Sutton, was a moving spring with her, as\r\nmuch as her own wish for the scenes round which imagination had thrown\r\nsuch a brilliant halo. Of society they had hitherto seen little or\r\nnothing; Mrs. Langford\'s health and spirits had never been equal to\r\nvisiting, nor was there much to tempt her in the changing inhabitants of\r\na watering-place. Now and then, perhaps, an old acquaintance or distant\r\nconnexion of some part of the family came for a month or six weeks, and\r\na few calls were exchanged, and it was one of these visits that led to\r\nthe following conversation.\r\n\r\n"By the by, mamma," said Fred, "I meant to ask you what that foolish\r\nwoman meant about the St. Legers, and their not having thoroughly\r\napproved of Aunt Geoffrey\'s marriage."\r\n\r\n"About the most ill-placed thing she could have said, Freddy," replied\r\nMrs. Langford, "considering that I was always accused of having made the\r\nmatch."\r\n\r\n"Made the match! O tell us, mamma; tell us all about it. Did you\r\nreally?"\r\n\r\n"Not consciously; Fred, and Frank St. Leger deserves as much of the\r\ncredit as I do."\r\n\r\n"Who was he? a brother of Aunt Geoffrey\'s?"\r\n\r\n"O yes, Fred," said Henrietta, "to be sure you knew that. You have heard\r\nhow mamma came home from India with General St. Leger and his little boy\r\nand girl. But by the by, mamma, what became of their mother?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Beatrice? She died in India just before we came home. Well, I used\r\nto stay with them after we came back to England, and of course talked to\r\nmy friend--"\r\n\r\n"Call her Beatrice, mamma, and make a story of it."\r\n\r\n"I talked to her about my Knight Sutton home, and cousins, and on the\r\nother hand, then, Frank was always telling her about his school friend\r\nGeoffrey Langford. At last Frank brought him home from Oxford one Easter\r\nvacation. It was when the general was in command at ----, and Beatrice\r\nwas in the midst of all sorts of gaieties, the mistress of the house,\r\nentertaining everybody, and all exactly what a novel would call\r\nbrilliant."\r\n\r\n"Were you there, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Beatrice had made a point of our coming to stay with her, and very\r\ndroll it was to see how she and Geoffrey were surprised at each other;\r\nshe to find her brother\'s guide, philosopher, and friend, the Langford\r\nwho had gained every prize, a boyish-looking, boyish-mannered youth,\r\nvery shy at first, and afterwards, excellent at giggling and making\r\ngiggle; and he to find one with the exterior of a fine gay lady, so\r\nreally simple in tastes and habits."\r\n\r\n"Was Aunt Geoffrey ever pretty?" asked Fred.\r\n\r\n"She is just what she was then, a little brown thing with no actual\r\nbeauty but in her animation and in her expression. I never saw a really\r\nhandsome person who seemed to me nearly as charming. Then she had, and\r\nindeed has now, so much air and grace, so much of what, for want of a\r\nbetter word, I must call fashion in her appearance, that she was always\r\nvery striking."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henrietta, "I can quite see that; it is not gracefulness,\r\nand it is not beauty, nor is it what she ever thinks of, but there is\r\nsomething distinguished about her. I should look twice at her if I met\r\nher in the street, and expect her to get into a carriage with a coronet.\r\nAnd then and there they fell in love, did they?"\r\n\r\n"In long morning expeditions with the ostensible purpose of sketching,\r\nbut in which I had all the drawing to myself, while the others talked\r\neither wondrous wisely or wondrous drolly. However, you must not suppose\r\nthat anything of the novel kind was said then; Geoffrey was only twenty,\r\nand Beatrice seemed as much out of his reach as the king\'s daughter of\r\nHongarie."\r\n\r\n"O yes, of course," said Henrietta, "but that only makes it more\r\ndelightful! Only to think of Uncle and Aunt Geoffrey having a novel in\r\ntheir history."\r\n\r\n"That there are better novels in real life than in stories, is a truth\r\nor a truism often repeated, Henrietta," said her mother with a soft\r\nsigh, which she repressed in an instant, and proceeded: "Poor Frank\'s\r\nillness and death at Oxford brought them together the next year in a\r\nvery different manner. Geoffrey was one of his chief nurses to the last,\r\nand was a great comfort to them all; you may suppose how grateful they\r\nwere to him. Next time I saw him, he seemed quite to have buried his\r\nyouthful spirits in his studies: he was reading morning, noon, and\r\nnight, and looking ill and overworked."\r\n\r\n"O, Uncle Geoffrey! dear good Uncle Geoffrey," cried Henrietta, in an\r\necstasy; "you were as delightful as a knight of old, only as you could\r\nnot fight tournaments for her, you were obliged to read for her; and\r\npining away all the time and saying nothing about it."\r\n\r\n"Nothing beyond a demure inquiry of me when we were alone together,\r\nafter the health of the General. Well, you know how well his reading\r\nsucceeded; he took a double first class, and very proud of him we were."\r\n\r\n"And still he saw nothing of her," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Not till some time after he had been settled in his chambers at the\r\nTemple. Now you must know that General St. Leger, though in most matters\r\na wise man, was not by any means so in money matters: and by some\r\nunlucky speculation which was to have doubled his daughter\'s fortune,\r\nmanaged to lose the whole of it, leaving little but his pay."\r\n\r\n"Capital!" cried Frederick, "that brings her down to him."\r\n\r\n"So it did," said his mother, smiling; "but the spectators did not\r\nrejoice quite so heartily as you do. The general\'s health was failing,\r\nand it was hard to think what would become of Beatrice; for Lord St.\r\nLeger\'s family, though very kind, were not more congenial than they are\r\nnow. As soon as all this was pretty well known, Geoffrey spoke, and the\r\ngeneral, who was very fond of him, gave full consent. They meant to wait\r\nuntil it was prudent, of course, and were well contented; but just after\r\nit was all settled, the general had a sudden seizure, and died. Geoffrey\r\nwas with him, and he treated him like a son, saying it was his great\r\ncomfort to know that her happiness was in his hands. Poor Beatrice, she\r\nwent first to the St. Legers, stayed with them two or three months, then\r\nI would have her to be my bridesmaid, though"--and Mrs. Langford tried\r\nto smile, while again she strangled a sobbing sigh--"she warned me that\r\nher mourning was a bad omen. Well, she stayed with my mother while we\r\nwent abroad, and on our return went with us to be introduced at Knight\r\nSutton. Everybody was charmed, Mrs. Langford and Aunt Roger had expected\r\na fine lady or a blue one, but they soon learnt to believe all her\r\ngaiety and all her cleverness a mere calumny, and grandpapa was\r\ndelighted with her the first moment. How well I remember Geoffrey\'s\r\ncoming home and thanking us for having managed so well as to make her\r\nlike one of the family, while the truth was that she had fitted herself\r\nin, and found her place from the first moment. Now came a time of grave\r\nprivate conferences. A long engagement which might have been very well\r\nif the general had lived, was a dreary prospect now that Beatrice was\r\nwithout a home; but then your uncle was but just called to the bar,\r\nand had next to nothing of his own, present or to come. However, he\r\nhad begun his literary works, and found them answer so well, that he\r\nbelieved he could maintain himself till briefs came in, and he had the\r\nsort of talent which gives confidence. He thought, too, that even in\r\nthe event of his death she would be better off as one of us, than as\r\na dependent on the St. Legers; and at last by talking to us, he nearly\r\npersuaded himself to believe it would be a very prudent thing to marry.\r\nIt was a harder matter to persuade his father, but persuade him he did,\r\nand the wedding was at Knight Sutton that very summer."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," cried Fred, "excellent and glorious! A farthing for all\r\nthe St. Legers put together."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, Fred, in spite of your disdain, we were all of opinion\r\nthat it was a matter of rejoicing that Lord St. Leger and Lady\r\nAmelia were present, so that no one had any reason to say that they\r\ndisapproved. Moreover, lest you should learn imprudence from my story,\r\nI would also suggest that if your uncle and aunt had not been a couple\r\ncomme il-y-en a peu, it would neither have been excellent nor glorious."\r\n\r\n"Why, they are very well off," said Fred; "he is quite at the head of\r\nhis profession. The first thing a fellow asks me when he hears my name\r\nis, if I belong to Langford the barrister."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he never would have been eminent, scarcely have had daily\r\nbread, if he had not worked fearfully hard, so hard that without the\r\nbuoyant school-boy spirit, which can turn from the hardest toil like a\r\nchild to its play, his health could never have stood it."\r\n\r\n"But then it has been success and triumph," said Fred; "one could work\r\nlike a galley-slave with encouragement, and never feel it drudgery."\r\n\r\n"It was not all success at first," said his mother; "there was hard\r\nwork, and disappointment, and heavy sorrow too; but they knew how to\r\nbear it, and to win through with it."\r\n\r\n"And were they very poor?" asked Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Yes: but it was beautiful to see how she accommodated herself to it.\r\nThe house that once looked dingy and desolate, was very soon pretty and\r\ncheerful, and the wirtschaft so well ordered and economical, that Aunt\r\nRoger was struck dumb with admiration. I shall not forget Lady Susan\'s\r\nvisit the last morning we spent with her in London, how amazed she was\r\nto find \'poor Beatrice\' looking so bright and like herself, and how\r\nlittle she guessed at her morning\'s work, the study of shirt-making, and\r\nthe copying out a review of her husband\'s, full of Greek quotations."\r\n\r\n"Well, the poverty is all over now," said Henrietta; "but still they\r\nlive in a very quiet way, considering Aunt Geoffrey\'s connexions and the\r\nfortune he has made."\r\n\r\n"Who put that notion into your head, my wise daughter?" said Mrs.\r\nLangford.\r\n\r\nHenrietta blushed, laughed, and mentioned Lady Matilda St. Leger, a\r\ncousin of her aunt Geoffrey\'s of whom she had seen something in the last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n"The truth is," said Mrs. Langford, "that your aunt had display and\r\nluxury enough in her youth to value it as it deserves, and he could not\r\ndesire it except for her sake. They had rather give with a free hand,\r\nbeyond what any one knows or suspects."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I know among other things that he sends Alexander to school," said\r\nFred.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and the improvements at Knight Sutton," said Henrietta, "the\r\nschool, and all that grandpapa wished but could never afford. Well,\r\nmamma, if you made the match, you deserve to be congratulated on your\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nobody like Uncle Geoffrey, I have said, and shall always\r\nmaintain," said Fred.\r\n\r\nHis mother sighed, saying, "I don\'t know what we should have done\r\nwithout him!" and became silent. Henrietta saw an expression on her\r\ncountenance which made her unwilling to disturb her, and nothing more\r\nwas said till it was discovered that it was bed time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Where is Madame?" asked Frederick of his sister, as she entered the\r\nbreakfast room alone the next morning with the key of the tea-chest in\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n"A headache," answered Henrietta, "and a palpitation."\r\n\r\n"A bad one?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, very; and I am afraid it is our fault, Freddy; I am convinced it\r\nwill not do, and we must give it up."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean? The going to Knight Sutton? What has that to do with\r\nit? Is it the reviving old recollections that is too much for her?"\r\n\r\n"Just listen what an effect last evening\'s conversation had upon her.\r\nLast night, after I had been asleep a long time, I woke up, and there\r\nI saw her kneeling before the table with her hands over her face. Just\r\nthen it struck one, and soon after she got into bed. I did not let her\r\nknow I was awake, for speaking would only have made it worse, but I am\r\nsure she did not sleep all night, and this morning she had one of her\r\nmost uncomfortable fits of palpitation. She had just fallen asleep, when\r\nI looked in after dressing, but I do not think she will be fit to come\r\ndown to-day."\r\n\r\n"And do you think it was talking of Uncle and Aunt Geoffrey that brought\r\nit on?" said Fred, with much concern; "yet it did not seem to have much\r\nto do with my father."\r\n\r\n"O but it must," said Henrietta. "He must have been there all the time\r\nmixed up in everything. Queen Bee has told me how they were always\r\ntogether when they were children."\r\n\r\n"Ah! perhaps; and I noticed how she spoke about her wedding," said\r\nFred. "Yes, and to compare how differently it has turned out with Aunt\r\nGeoffrey and with her, after they had been young and happy together.\r\nYes, no doubt it was he who persuaded the people at Knight Sutton into\r\nletting them marry!"\r\n\r\n"And their sorrow that she spoke of must have been his death," said\r\nHenrietta. "No doubt the going over those old times renewed all those\r\nthoughts."\r\n\r\n"And you think going to Knight Sutton might have the same effect. Well,\r\nI suppose we must give it up," said Fred, with a sigh. "After all, we\r\ncan be very happy here!"\r\n\r\n"O yes! that we can. It is more on your account than mine, that I wished\r\nit," said the sister.\r\n\r\n"And I should not have thought so much of it, if I had not thought it\r\nwould be pleasanter for you when I am away," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"And so," said Henrietta, laughing yet sighing, "we agree to persuade\r\neach other that we don\'t care about it."\r\n\r\nFred performed a grimace, and remarked that if Henrietta continued to\r\nmake her tea so scalding, there would soon be a verdict against her\r\nof fratricide; but the observation, being intended to conceal certain\r\nfeelings of disappointment and heroism, only led to silence.\r\n\r\nAfter sleeping for some hours, Mrs. Langford awoke refreshed, and got\r\nup, but did not leave her room. Frederick and Henrietta went to take a\r\nwalk by her desire, as she declared that she preferred being alone, and\r\non their return they found her lying on the sofa.\r\n\r\n"Mamma has been in mischief," said Fred. "She did not think herself\r\nknocked up enough already, so she has been doing it more thoroughly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma!" was Henrietta\'s reproachful exclamation, as she looked at\r\nher pale face and red swollen eyelids.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, my dears," said she, trying to smile, "I shall be better\r\nnow this is done, and I have it off my mind." They looked at her in\r\nanxious interrogation, and she smiled outright with lip and eye. "You\r\nwill seal that letter with a good will, Henrietta," she said. "It is to\r\nask Uncle Geoffrey to make inquiries about the Pleasance."\r\n\r\n"Mamma!" and they stood transfixed at a decision beyond their hopes:\r\nthen Henrietta exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"No, no, mamma, it will be too much for you; you must not think of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Fred; "indeed we agreed this morning that it would be\r\nbetter not. Put it out of your head, mamma, and go on here in peace and\r\ncomfort. I am sure it suits you best."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you, my dear ones," said she, drawing them towards\r\nher, and fondly kissing them, "but it is all settled, and I am sure it\r\nis better for you. It is but a dull life for you here."\r\n\r\n"O no, no, no, dearest mamma: nothing can be dull with you," cried\r\nHenrietta, wishing most sincerely to undo her own work. "We are, indeed\r\nwe are, as happy as the day is long. Do not fancy we are discontented;\r\ndo not think we want a change."\r\n\r\nMrs. Langford replied by an arch though subdued smile.\r\n\r\n"But we would not have you to do it on our account," said Fred. "Pray\r\nput it out of your head, for we do very well here, and it was only a\r\npassing fancy."\r\n\r\n"You will not talk me out of it, my dears," said Mrs. Langford. "I know\r\nit is right, and it shall be done. It is only the making up my mind that\r\nwas the struggle, and I shall look forward to it as much as either of\r\nyou, when I know it is to be done. Now walk off, my dears, and do not\r\nlet that letter be too late for the post."\r\n\r\n"I do not half like it," said Fred, pausing at the door.\r\n\r\n"I have not many fears on that score," said she, smiling. "No, do not\r\nbe uneasy about me, my dear Fred, it is my proper place, and I must be\r\nhappy there. I shall like to be near the Hall, and to see all the dear\r\nold places again."\r\n\r\n"O, mamma, you cannot talk about them without your voice quivering,"\r\nsaid Henrietta. "You do not know how I wish you would give it up!"\r\n\r\n"Give it up! I would not for millions," said Mrs. Langford. "Now go, my\r\ndears, and perhaps I shall go to sleep again."\r\n\r\nThe spirits of the brother and sister did not just at first rise enough\r\nfor rejoicing over the decision. Henrietta would willingly have kept\r\nback the letter, but this she could not do; and sealing it as if\r\nshe were doing wrong, she sat down to dinner, feeling subdued and\r\nremorseful, something like a tyrant between the condemnation and\r\nexecution of his victim. But by the time the first course was over, and\r\nshe and Frederick had begun to recollect their long-cherished wishes,\r\nthey made up their minds to be happy, and fell into their usual strain\r\nof admiration of the unknown haven of their hopes, and of expectations\r\nthat it would in the end benefit their mother.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she was quite in her usual spirits, and affairs\r\nproceeded in the usual manner; Frederick\'s holidays came to an end, and\r\nhe returned to school with many a fond lamentation from the mother and\r\nsister, but with cheerful auguries from both that the next meeting might\r\nbe at Knight Sutton.\r\n\r\n"Here, Henrietta," said her mother, as they sat at breakfast together a\r\nday or two after Frederick\'s departure, turning over to her the letter\r\nof which she had first broken the seal, while she proceeded to open some\r\nothers. It was Uncle Geoffrey\'s writing, and Henrietta read eagerly:\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR MARY,--I would not write till I could give you some positive\r\ninformation about the Pleasance, and that could not be done without a\r\nconference with Hardy, who was not at home. I am heartily glad that you\r\nthink of coming among us again, but still I should like to feel certain\r\nthat it is you that feel equal to it, and not the young ones who are set\r\nupon the plan. I suppose you will indignantly refute the charge, but you\r\nknow I have never trusted you in that matter. However, we are too much\r\nthe gainers to investigate motives closely, and I cannot but believe\r\nthat the effort once over, you would find it a great comfort to be among\r\nyour own people, and in your own country. I fully agree with you also in\r\nwhat you say of the advantage to Henrietta and Fred. My father is going\r\nto write, and I must leave him to do justice to his own cordiality, and\r\nproceed to business."\r\n\r\n\r\nThen came the particulars of freehold and copyhold, purchase or lease,\r\nrepair or disrepair, of which Henrietta knew nothing, and cared less;\r\nshe knew that her mamma was considered a great heiress, and trusted to\r\nher wealth for putting all she pleased in her power: but it was rather\r\nalarming to recollect that Uncle Geoffrey would consider it right to\r\nmake the best terms he could, and that the house might be lost to them\r\nwhile they were bargaining for it.\r\n\r\n"O, mamma, never mind what he says about its being dear," said she, "I\r\ndare say it will not ruin us."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly," said Mrs. Langford, smiling, "but gentlemen consider it a\r\ndisgrace not to make a good bargain, and Uncle Geoffrey must be allowed\r\nto have his own way."\r\n\r\n"O but, mamma, suppose some one else should take it."\r\n\r\n"A village house is not like these summer lodgings, which are snapped up\r\nbefore you can look at them," said Mrs. Langford; "I have no fears but\r\nthat it is to be had." But Henrietta could not help fancying that her\r\nmother would regard it somewhat as a reprieve, if the bargain was to go\r\noff independently of any determination of hers.\r\n\r\nStill she had made up her mind to look cheerfully at the scheme, and\r\noften talked of it with pleasure, to which the cordial and affectionate\r\nletters of her father-in-law and the rest of the family, conduced not a\r\nlittle. She now fully perceived that it had only been from forbearance,\r\nthat they had not before urged her return, and as she saw how earnestly\r\nit was desired by Mr. and Mrs. Langford, reproached herself as for\r\na weakness for not having sooner resolved upon her present step.\r\nHenrietta\'s work was rather to keep up her spirits at the prospect,\r\nthan to prevent her from changing her purpose, which never altered,\r\nrespecting a return to the neighbourhood of Knight Sutton, though\r\nwhether to the house of the tempting name, was a question which remained\r\nin agitation during the rest of the autumn, for as surely as Rome was\r\nnot built in a day, so surely cannot a house be bought or sold in a day,\r\nespecially when a clever and cautious lawyer acts for one party.\r\n\r\nMatters thus dragged on, till the space before the Christmas holidays\r\nwas reckoned by weeks, instead of months, and as Mrs. Frederick Langford\r\nlaughingly said, she should be fairly ashamed to meet her boy again at\r\ntheir present home. She therefore easily allowed herself to be persuaded\r\nto accept Mr. Langford\'s invitation to take up her quarters at the Hall,\r\nand look about her a little before finally deciding upon the Pleasance.\r\nChristmas at Knight Sutton Hall had the greatest charms in the eyes\r\nof Henrietta and Frederick; for many a time had they listened to the\r\ndescriptions given con amore by Beatrice Langford, to whom that place\r\nhad ever been a home, perhaps the more beloved, because the other half\r\nof her life was spent in London.\r\n\r\nIt was a great disappointment, however, to hear that Mrs. Geoffrey\r\nLangford was likely to be detained in London by the state of health of\r\nher aunt, Lady Susan St. Leger, whom she did not like to leave, while no\r\nother of the family was at hand. This was a cruel stroke, but she could\r\nnot bear that her husband should miss his yearly holiday, her daughter\r\nlose the pleasure of a fortnight with Henrietta, or Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLangford be deprived of the visit of their favourite son: and she\r\ntherefore arranged to go and stay with Lady Susan, while Beatrice and\r\nher father went as usual to Knight Sutton.\r\n\r\nMr. Geoffrey Langford offered to escort his sister-in-law from\r\nDevonshire, but she did not like his holidays to be so wasted. She had\r\nno merely personal apprehensions, and new as railroads were to her,\r\ndeclared herself perfectly willing and able to manage with no companions\r\nbut her daughter and maid, with whom she was to travel to his house\r\nin London, there to be met in a day or two by the two school-boys,\r\nFrederick and his cousin Alexander, and then proceed all together to\r\nKnight Sutton.\r\n\r\nHenrietta could scarcely believe that the long-wished-for time was\r\nreally come, packing up actually commencing, and that her waking would\r\nfind her under a different roof from that which she had never left. She\r\ndid not know till now that she had any attachments to the place she\r\nhad hitherto believed utterly devoid of all interest; but she found she\r\ncould not bid it farewell without sorrow. There was the old boatman with\r\nhis rough kindly courtesy, and his droll ways of speaking; there was the\r\nrocky beach where she and her brother had often played on the verge of\r\nthe ocean, watching with mysterious awe or sportive delight the ripple\r\nof the advancing waves, the glorious sea itself, the walks, the woods,\r\nstreams, and rocks, which she now believed, as mamma and Uncle Geoffrey\r\nhad often told her, were more beautiful than anything she was likely to\r\nfind in Sussex. Other scenes there were, connected with her grandmother,\r\nwhich she grieved much at parting with, but she shunned talking over her\r\nregrets, lest she should agitate her mother, whom she watched with great\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nShe was glad that so much business was on her hands, as to leave little\r\ntime for dwelling on her feelings, to which she attributed the\r\ncalm quietness with which she went through the few trying days that\r\nimmediately preceded their departure. Henrietta felt this constant\r\nemployment so great a relief to her own spirits, that she was sorry on\r\nher own account, as well as her mother\'s, when every possible order had\r\nbeen given, every box packed, and nothing was to be done, but to sit\r\nopposite to each other, on each side of the fire, in the idleness which\r\nprecedes candle-light. Her mother leant back in silence, and she watched\r\nher with an anxious gaze. She feared to say anything of sympathy\r\nwith what she supposed her feeling, lest she should make her weep. An\r\nindifferent speech would be out of place even if Henrietta herself could\r\nhave made it, and yet to remain silent was to allow melancholy thoughts\r\nto prey upon her. So thought the daughter, longing at the same time that\r\nher persuasions were all unsaid.\r\n\r\n"Come here, my dear child," said her mother presently, and Henrietta\r\nalmost started at the calmness of the voice, and the serenity of the\r\ntranquil countenance. She crossed to her mother, and sat down on a\r\nlow footstool, leaning against her. "You are very much afraid for me,"\r\ncontinued Mrs. Langford, as she remarked upon the anxious expression of\r\nher face, far different from her own, "but you need not fear, it is all\r\nwell with me; it would be wrong not to be thankful for those who are not\r\nreally lost to me as well as for those who were given to me here."\r\n\r\nAll Henrietta\'s consideration for her mother could not prevent her from\r\nbursting into tears. "O mamma, I did not know it would be so like going\r\naway from dear grandmamma."\r\n\r\n"Try to feel the truth, my dear, that our being near to her depends on\r\nwhether we are in our duty or not."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, but this place is so full of her! I do so love it! I did not\r\nknow it till now!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we must always love it, my dear child; but we are going to our\r\nhome, Henrietta, to your father\'s home in life and death, and it must be\r\ngood for us to be there. With your grandfather, who has wished for us.\r\nKnight Sutton is our true home, the one where it is right for us to be."\r\n\r\nHenrietta still wept bitterly, and strange it was that it should be she\r\nwho stood in need of consolation, for the fulfilment of her own most\r\nardent wish, and from the very person to whom it was the greatest trial.\r\nIt was not, however, self-reproach that caused her tears, that her\r\nmother\'s calmness prevented her from feeling, but only attachment to the\r\nplace she was about to leave, and the recollections, which she accused\r\nherself of having slighted. Her mother, who had made up her mind to do\r\nwhat was right, found strength and peace at the moment of trial, when\r\nthe wayward and untrained spirits of the daughter gave way. Not that she\r\nblamed Henrietta, she was rather gratified to find that she was so much\r\nattached to her home and her grandmother, and felt so much with her; and\r\nafter she had succeeded in some degree in restoring her to composure,\r\nthey talked long and earnestly over old times and deeper feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journey to London was prosperously performed, and Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford was not overfatigued when she arrived at Uncle Geoffrey\'s house\r\nat Westminster. The cordiality of their greeting may be imagined, as a\r\nvisit from Henrietta had been one of the favourite visions of her cousin\r\nBeatrice, through her whole life; and the two girls were soon deep in\r\nthe delights of a conversation in which sense and nonsense had an equal\r\nshare.\r\n\r\nThe next day was spent by the two Mrs. Langfords in quiet together,\r\nwhile Henrietta was conducted through a rapid whirl of sight-seeing by\r\nBeatrice and Uncle Geoffrey, the latter of whom, to his niece\'s great\r\namazement, professed to find almost as much novelty in the sights as she\r\ndid. A short December day, though not what they would have chosen, had\r\nthis advantage, that the victim could not be as completely fagged and\r\nworn out as in a summer\'s day, and Henrietta was still fresh and in high\r\nspirits when they drove home and found to their delight that the two\r\nschoolboys had already arrived.\r\n\r\nBeatrice met both alike as old friends and almost brothers, but\r\nAlexander, though returning her greeting with equal cordiality, looked\r\nshyly at the new aunt and cousin, and as Henrietta suspected, wished\r\nthem elsewhere. She had heard much of him from Beatrice, and knew that\r\nher brother regarded him as a formidable rival; and she was therefore\r\nsurprised to see that his broad honest face expressed more good\r\nhumour than intellect, and his manners wanted polish. He was tolerably\r\nwell-featured, with light eyes and dark hair, and though half a year\r\nolder than his cousin, was much shorter, more perhaps in appearance than\r\nreality, from the breadth and squareness of his shoulders, and from not\r\ncarrying himself well.\r\n\r\nAlexander was, as ought previously to have been recorded, the third son\r\nof Mr. Roger Langford, the heir of Knight Sutton, at present living at\r\nSutton Leigh, a small house on his father\'s estate, busied with farming,\r\nsporting, and parish business; while his active wife contrived to make\r\na narrow income feed, clothe, and at least half educate their endless\r\ntribe of boys. Roger, the eldest, was at sea; Frederick, the second, in\r\nIndia; and Alexander owed his more learned education to Uncle Geoffrey,\r\nwho had been well recompensed by his industry and good conduct. Indeed\r\nhis attainments had always been so superior to those of his brothers,\r\nthat he might have been considered as a prodigy, had not his cousin\r\nFrederick been always one step before him.\r\n\r\nFred had greater talent, and had been much better taught at home, so\r\nthat on first going to school, he took and kept the higher place; but\r\nthis was but a small advantage in his eyes, compared with what he had to\r\nendure out of school during his first half-year. Unused to any training\r\nor companionship save of womankind, he was disconsolate, bewildered,\r\nderided in that new rude world; while Alex, accustomed to fight his\r\nway among rude brothers, instantly found his level, and even extended\r\na protecting hand to his cousin, who requited it with little gratitude.\r\nSoon overcoming his effeminate habits, he grew expert and dexterous,\r\nand was equal to Alex in all but main bodily strength; but the spirit\r\nof rivalry once excited, had never died away, and with a real friendship\r\nand esteem for each other, their names or rather their nicknames had\r\nalmost become party words among their schoolfellows.\r\n\r\nNor was it probable that this competition would be forgotten on this\r\nfirst occasion of spending their holidays together. Fred felt himself\r\nopen to that most galling accusation of want of manliness, on account\r\nat once of his ignorance of country sports, and of his knowledge\r\nof accomplishments; but he did not guess at the feeling which made\r\nAlexander on his side regard those very accomplishments with a feeling\r\nwhich, if it were not jealousy, was at least very nearly akin to it.\r\n\r\nBeatrice Langford had not the slightest claim to beauty. She was very\r\nlittle, and so thin that her papa did her no injustice when he called\r\nher skin and bones; but her thin brown face, with the aid of a pair\r\nof very large deep Italian-looking eyes, was so full of brilliant\r\nexpression, and showed such changes of feeling from sad to gay, from\r\nsublime to ridiculous, that no one could have wished one feature\r\notherwise. And if instead of being "like the diamond bright," they had\r\nbeen "dull as lead," it would have been little matter to Alex. Beatrice\r\nhad been, she was still, his friend, his own cousin, more than what he\r\ncould believe a sister to be if he had one,--in short his own little\r\nQueen Bee. He had had a monopoly of her; she had trained him in all\r\nthe civilization which he possessed, and it was with considerable\r\nmortification that he thought himself lowered in her eyes by comparison\r\nwith his old rival, as old a friend of hers, with the same claim to\r\ncousinly affection; and instead of understanding only what she had\r\ntaught him, familiar with the tastes and pursuits on which she set\r\nperhaps too great a value.\r\n\r\nFred did not care nearly as much for Beatrice\'s preference: it might be\r\nthat he took it as a matter of course, or perhaps that having a sister\r\nof his own, he did not need her sympathy, but still it was a point on\r\nwhich he was likely to be sensitive, and thus her favour was likely\r\nto be secretly quite as much a matter of competition as their school\r\nstudies and pastimes.\r\n\r\nFor instance, dinner was over, and Henrietta was admiring some choice\r\nbooks of prints, such luxuries as Uncle Geoffrey now afforded himself,\r\nand which his wife and daughter greatly preferred to the more costly\r\nstyle of living which some people thought befitted them. She called to\r\nher brother who was standing by the fire, "Fred, do come and look at\r\nthis beautiful Albert Durer of Sintram."\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, doubting whether Alexander would scorn him for an\r\nacquaintance with Albert Durer, but Beatrice added, "Yes, it was an\r\nold promise that I would show it to you. There now, look, admire, or be\r\npronounced insensible."\r\n\r\n"A wonderful old fellow was that Albert," said Fred, looking, and\r\nforgetting his foolish false shame in the pleasure of admiration. "Yes;\r\nO how wondrously the expression on Death\'s face changes as it does in\r\nthe story! How easy it is to see how Fouque must have built it up! Have\r\nyou seen it, mamma?"\r\n\r\nHis mother came to admire. Another print was produced, and another, and\r\nFred and Beatrice were eagerly studying the elaborate engravings of the\r\nold German, when Alex, annoyed at finding her too much engrossed to have\r\na word for him, came to share their occupation, and took up one of\r\nthe prints with no practised hand. "Take care, Alex, take care," cried\r\nBeatrice, in a sort of excruciated tone; "don\'t you see what a pinch you\r\nare giving it! Only the initiated ought to handle a print: there is a\r\npattern for you," pointing to Fred.\r\n\r\nShe cut right and left: both looked annoyed, and retreated from the\r\ntable. Fred thinking how Alex must look down on fingers which possessed\r\nany tenderness; Alex provoked at once and pained. Queen Bee\'s black eyes\r\nperceived their power, and gave a flash of laughing triumph.\r\n\r\nBut Beatrice was not quite in her usual high spirits, for she was very\r\nsorry to leave her mother; and when they went up stairs for the night,\r\nshe stood long over the fire talking to her, and listening to certain\r\nparting cautions.\r\n\r\n"How I wish you could have come, mamma! I am so sure that grandmamma in\r\nher kindness will tease Aunt Mary to death. You are the only person who\r\ncan guard her without affronting grandmamma. Now I--"\r\n\r\n"Had better let it alone," rejoined Mrs. Geoffrey Langford. "You will do\r\nmore harm than by letting things take their course. Remember, too, that\r\nAunt Mary was at home there long before you or I knew the place."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if that tiresome Aunt Amelia would but have had some consideration!\r\nTo go out of town and leave Aunt Susan on our hands just when we always\r\ngo home!"\r\n\r\n"We have lamented that often enough," said her mother smiling. "It is\r\nunlucky, but it cannot be too often repeated, that wills and wishes must\r\nsometimes bend."\r\n\r\n"You say that for me, mamma," said Beatrice. "You think grandmamma and I\r\nhave too much will for each other."\r\n\r\n"If you are conscious of that, Bee, I hope that you will bend that\r\nwilful will of yours."\r\n\r\n"I hope I shall," said Beatrice, "but.... Well, I must go to bed. Good\r\nnight, mamma."\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Geoffrey Langford looked after her daughter anxiously, but she\r\nwell knew that Beatrice knew her besetting fault, and she trusted to the\r\nmany fervent resolutions she had made against it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the party bade adieu to Mrs. Geoffrey Langford, and\r\nset out on their journey to Knight Sutton. They filled a whole railroad\r\ncarriage, and were a very cheerful party. Alexander and Beatrice\r\nsat opposite to each other, talking over Knight Sutton delights with\r\nanimation, Beatrice ever and anon turning to her other cousins with\r\nexplanations, or referring to her papa, who was reading the newspaper\r\nand talking with Mrs. Frederick Langford.\r\n\r\nThe day was not long enough for all the talk of the cousins, and the\r\nearly winter twilight came on before their conversation was exhausted,\r\nor they had reached the Allonfield station.\r\n\r\n"Here we are!" exclaimed Beatrice, as the train stopped, and at the same\r\nmoment a loud voice called out, "All right! where are you, Alex?" upon\r\nwhich Alexander tumbled across Henrietta to feel for the handle of the\r\ncarriage-door, replying, "Here, old fellow, let us out. Have you brought\r\nDumpling?" And Uncle Geoffrey and Beatrice exclaimed, "How d\'ye do,\r\nCarey?"\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander had succeeded in making his exit, Henrietta beheld him\r\nshaking hands with a figure not quite his own height, and in its rough\r\ngreat-coat not unlike a small species of bear. Uncle Geoffrey and Fred\r\nhanded out the ladies, and sought their appurtenances in the dark, and\r\nHenrietta began to give Alex credit for a portion of that which maketh\r\nman, when he shoved his brother, admonishing him that there was Aunt\r\nMary, upon which Carey advanced, much encumbered with sheepish shyness,\r\npresented a great rough driving-glove, and shortly and bluntly replied\r\nto the soft tones which kindly greeted him, and inquired for all at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n"Is the Hall carriage come?" asked Alex, and, receiving a gruff\r\naffirmative, added, "then, Aunt Mary, you had better come to it while\r\nUncle Geoffrey looks after the luggage," offered his arm with tolerable\r\ncourtesy, and conducted her to the carriage. "There," said he, "Carey\r\nhas driven in our gig, and I suppose Fred and I had better go back with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Is the horse steady?" asked his aunt, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Dumple? To be sure! Never does wrong! do you, old fellow?" said Alex,\r\npatting his old friend.\r\n\r\n"And no lamps?"\r\n\r\n"O, we know the way blindfold, and you might cross Sutton Heath a dozen\r\ntimes without meeting anything but a wheelbarrow-full of peat."\r\n\r\n"And how is the road now? It used to be very bad in my time."\r\n\r\n"Lots of ruts," muttered Carey to his brother, who interpreted it, "A\r\nfew ruts this winter, but Dumpling knows all the bad places."\r\n\r\nBy this time Uncle Geoffrey came up, and instantly perceiving the state\r\nof things, said, "I say, Freddy, do you mind changing places with me? I\r\nshould like to have a peep at Uncle Roger before going up to the house,\r\nand then Dumpling\'s feelings won\'t be hurt by passing the turn to Sutton\r\nLeigh."\r\n\r\nFred could not object, and his mother rejoiced in the belief that Uncle\r\nGeoffrey would take the reins, nor did Beatrice undeceive her, though,\r\nas the vehicle rattled past the carriage at full speed, she saw\r\nAlexander\'s own flourish of the whip, and knew that her papa was letting\r\nthe boys have their own way. She had been rather depressed in the\r\nmorning on leaving her mother, but as she came nearer home her spirits\r\nmounted, and she was almost wild with glee. "Aunt Mary, do you know\r\nwhere you are?"\r\n\r\n"On Sutton Heath, I presume, from the absence of landmarks."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that we are. You dear old place, how d\'ye do? You beginning of\r\nhome! I don\'t know when it is best coming to you: on a summer\'s evening,\r\nall glowing with purple heath, or a frosty star-light night like this.\r\nThere is the Sutton Leigh turn! Hurrah! only a mile further to the\r\ngate."\r\n\r\n"Where I used to go to meet the boys coming home from school," said\r\nher aunt, in a low tone of deep feeling. But she would not sadden their\r\nblithe young hearts, and added cheerfully, "Just the same as ever, I\r\nsee: how well I know the outline of the bank there!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, it is your fatherland, too, Aunt Mary! Is there not something\r\ninspiring in the very air? Come, Fred, can\'t you get up a little\r\nenthusiasm?"\r\n\r\n"Oceans, without getting it up," replied Fred. "I never was more\r\nrejoiced in my whole life," and he began to hum Domum.\r\n\r\n"Sing it, sing it; let us join in chorus as homage to Knight Sutton,"\r\ncried Henrietta.\r\n\r\nAnd the voices began, "Domum, Domum, dulce Domum;" even Aunt Mary\r\nherself caught the feelings of her young companions, felt herself coming\r\nto her own beloved home and parents, half forgot how changed was her\r\nsituation, and threw herself into the delight of returning.\r\n\r\n"Now, Fred," said Henrietta, "let us try those verses that you found a\r\ntune for, that begin \'What is home?\'"\r\n\r\nThis also was sung, and by the time it was finished they had reached a\r\ngate leading into a long drive through dark beech woods. "This is the\r\nbeautiful wood of which I have often told you, Henrietta," said Mrs.\r\nFrederick Langford.\r\n\r\n"The wood with glades like cathedral aisles," said Henrietta. "O, how\r\ndelightful it will be to see it come out in leaf!"\r\n\r\n"Which I have never seen," said Beatrice. "I tell papa he has made his\r\nfortune, and ought to retire, and he says he is too young for it."\r\n\r\n"In which I fully agree with him," said her aunt. "I should not like to\r\nsee him with nothing to do."\r\n\r\n"O, mamma, Uncle Geoffrey would never be anywhere with nothing to do,"\r\nsaid Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"No," said her mother, "but people are always happier with work made for\r\nthem, than with what they make for themselves. Besides, Uncle Geoffrey\r\nhas too much talent to be spared."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Fred, "I wondered to hear you so devoid of ambition, little\r\nBusy Bee."\r\n\r\n"It is only Knight Sutton and thinking of May flowers that makes me so,"\r\nsaid Beatrice. "I believe after all, I should break my heart if papa did\r\nretire without--"\r\n\r\n"Without what, Bee?"\r\n\r\n"Being Lord Chancellor, I suppose," said Henrietta very seriously. "I am\r\nsure I should."\r\n\r\n"His being in Parliament will content me for the present," said\r\nBeatrice, "for I have been told too often that high principles don\'t\r\nrise in the world, to expect any more. We can be just as proud of him as\r\nif he was."\r\n\r\n"You are in a wondrously humble and philosophic mood, Queen Bee," said\r\nHenrietta; "but where are we now?" added she, as a gate swung back.\r\n\r\n"Coming into the paddock," said Beatrice; "don\'t you see the lights in\r\nthe house? There, that is the drawing-room window to the right, and that\r\nlarge one the great hall window. Then upstairs, don\'t you see that red\r\nfire-light? That is the south room, which Aunt Mary will be sure to\r\nhave."\r\n\r\nHenrietta did not answer, for there was something that subdued her in\r\nthe nervous pressure of her mother\'s hand. The carriage stopped at the\r\ndoor, whence streamed forth light, dazzling to eyes long accustomed to\r\ndarkness; but in the midst stood a figure which Henrietta could not but\r\nhave recognized in an instant, even had not old Mr. Langford paid more\r\nthan one visit to Rocksand. Tall, thin, unbent, with high bald forehead,\r\nclear eye, and long snowy hair; there he was, lifting rather than\r\nhanding his daughter-in-law from the carriage, and fondly kissing her\r\nbrow; then he hastily greeted the other occupants of the carriage, while\r\nshe received the kiss of Mrs. Langford.\r\n\r\nThey were now in the hall, and turning again to his daughter-in-law, he\r\ngave her his arm, and led her into the drawing-room, where he once more\r\nembraced her, saying, "Bless you, my own dear Mary!" She clung to him\r\nfor a moment as if she longed to weep with him, but recovering herself\r\nin an instant, she gave her attention to Mrs. Langford, who was trying\r\nto administer to her comfort with a degree of bustle and activity which\r\nsuited well with the alertness of her small figure and the vivacity of\r\nthe black eyes which still preserved their brightness, though her hair\r\nwas perfectly white. "Well, Mary, my dear, I hope you are not tired. You\r\nhad better sit down and take off your furs, or will you go to your room?\r\nBut where is Geoffrey?"\r\n\r\n"He went with Alex and Carey, round by Sutton Leigh," said Beatrice.\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! my little Queen, are you there?" said grandpapa, holding out\r\nhis arms to her. "And," added he, "is not this your first introduction\r\nto the twins, grandmamma? Why you are grown as fine a pair as I would\r\nwish to see on a summer\'s day. Last time I saw you I could hardly tell\r\nyou apart, when you both wore straw hats and white trousers. No mistake\r\nnow though. Well, I am right glad to have you here."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you take off some of your wraps, Mary?" proceeded Mrs. Langford,\r\nand her daughter-in-law, with a soft "Thank you," passively obeyed. "And\r\nyou too, my dear," she added to Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Off with that bonnet, Miss Henrietta," proceeded grandpapa. "Let me\r\nsee whether you are as like your brother as ever. He has your own face,\r\nMary."\r\n\r\n"Do not you think his forehead like--" and she looked to the end of\r\nthe room where hung the portraits of two young children, the brothers\r\nGeoffrey and Frederick. Henrietta had often longed to see it, but now\r\nshe could attend to nothing but her mamma.\r\n\r\n"Like poor dear Frederick?" said grandmamma. "Well, I can\'t judge by\r\nfirelight, you know, my dear, but I should say they were both your very\r\nimage."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t be the image of any one I should like better," said Mr.\r\nLangford, turning to them cheerfully, and taking Henrietta\'s hand. "I\r\nwish nothing better than to find you the image of your mamma inside and\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Ah, there\'s Geoffrey!" cried Mrs. Langford, springing up and almost\r\nrunning to meet him.\r\n\r\n"Well, Geoffrey, how d\'ye do?" added his father with an indescribable\r\ntone and look of heartfelt delight. "Left all your cares behind you?"\r\n\r\n"Left my wife behind me," said Uncle Geoffrey, making a rueful face.\r\n\r\n"Ay, it is a sad business that poor Beatrice cannot come," said both the\r\nold people, "but how is poor Lady Susan?"\r\n\r\n"As usual, only too nervous to be left with none of the family at hand.\r\nWell, Mary, you look tired."\r\n\r\nOvercome, Uncle Geoffrey would have said, but he thought the other\r\naccusation would answer the same purpose and attract less attention,\r\nand it succeeded, for Mrs. Langford proposed to take her up stairs.\r\nHenrietta thought that Beatrice would have offered to save her the\r\ntrouble, but this would not have been at all according to the habits of\r\ngrandmamma or granddaughter, and Mrs. Langford briskly led the way to\r\na large cheerful-looking room, talking all the time and saying she\r\nsupposed Henrietta would like to be with her mamma. She nodded to their\r\nmaid, who was waiting there, and gave her a kindly greeting, stirred the\r\nalready bright fire into a blaze, and returning to her daughter-in-law\r\nwho was standing like one in a dream, she gave her a fond kiss, saying,\r\n"There, Mary, I thought you would like to be here."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you, you are always kind."\r\n\r\n"There now, Mary, don\'t let yourself be overcome. You would not\r\nbring him back again, I know. Come, lie down and rest. There--that is\r\nright--and don\'t think of coming down stairs. You think your mamma had\r\nbetter not, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Much better not, thank you, grandmamma," said Henrietta, as she\r\nassisted in settling her mother on the sofa. "She is tired and overcome\r\nnow, but she will be herself after a rest."\r\n\r\n"And ask for anything you like, my dear. A glass of wine or a cup of\r\ncoffee; Judith will get you one in a moment. Won\'t you have a cup of\r\ncoffee, Mary, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no thank you," said Mrs. Frederick Langford, raising\r\nherself. "Indeed I am sorry--it is very foolish." Here the choking sob\r\ncame again, and she was forced to lie down. Grandmamma stood by, warming\r\na shawl to throw over her, and pitying her in audible whispers. "Poor\r\nthing, poor thing! it is very sad for her. There! a pillow, my dear?\r\nI\'ll fetch one out of my room. No? Is her head high enough? Some\r\nsal-volatile? Yes, Mary, would you not like some sal-volatile?"\r\n\r\nAnd away she went in search of it, while Henrietta, excessively\r\ndistressed, knelt by her mother, who, throwing her arms round her neck,\r\nwept freely for some moments, then laid her head on the cushions again,\r\nsaying, "I did not think I was so weak!"\r\n\r\n"Dearest mamma," said Henrietta, kissing her and feeling very guilty.\r\n\r\n"If I have not distressed grandmamma!" said her mother anxiously. "No,\r\nnever mind me, my dear, it was fatigue and--"\r\n\r\nStill she could not finish, so painfully did the familiar voices, the\r\nunchanged furniture, recall both her happy childhood and the bridal days\r\nwhen she had last entered the house, that it seemed as it were a new\r\nthing, a fresh shock to miss the tone that was never to be heard there\r\nagain. Why should all around be the same, when all within was altered?\r\nBut it had been only the first few moments that had overwhelmed her, and\r\nthe sound of Mrs. Langford\'s returning footsteps recalled her habit of\r\nself-control; she thanked her, held out her quivering hand, drank the\r\nsal-volatile, pronounced herself much better, and asked pardon for\r\nhaving given so much trouble.\r\n\r\n"Trouble? my dear child, no such thing! I only wish I could see you\r\nbetter. No doubt it is too much for you, this coming home the first\r\ntime; but then you know poor Fred is gone to a better--Ah! well, I see\r\nyou can\'t bear to speak of him, and perhaps after all quiet is the best\r\nthing. Don\'t let your mamma think of dressing and coming down, my dear."\r\n\r\nThere was a little combat on this point, but it ended in Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford yielding, and agreeing to remain upstairs. Grandmamma would\r\nhave waited to propose to her each of the dishes that were to appear\r\nat table, and hear which she thought would suit her taste; but very\r\nfortunately, as Henrietta thought, a bell rang at that moment, which she\r\npronounced to be "the half-hour bell," and she hastened away, telling\r\nher granddaughter that dinner would be ready at half-past five, and\r\ncalling the maid outside the door to giver her full directions where to\r\nprocure anything that her mistress might want.\r\n\r\n"Dear grandmamma! just like herself!" said Mrs. Frederick Langford. "But\r\nHenrietta, my dear," she added with some alarm, "make haste and dress:\r\nyou must never be too late in this house!"\r\n\r\nHenrietta was not much accustomed to dress to a moment, and she was too\r\nanxious about her mamma to make speed with her whole will, and her hair\r\nwas in no state of forwardness when the dinner-bell rang, causing her\r\nmamma to start and hasten her with an eager, almost alarmed manner. "You\r\ndon\'t know how your grandmamma dislikes being kept waiting," said she.\r\n\r\nAt last she was ready, and running down, found all the rest assembled,\r\nevidently waiting for her. Frederick, looking anxious, met her at the\r\ndoor to receive her assurances that their mother was better; the rest\r\ninquired, and her apologies were cut short by grandmamma calling them\r\nto eat her turkey before it grew cold. The spirits of all the party were\r\nperhaps damped by Mrs. Frederick Langford\'s absence and its cause, for\r\nthe dinner was not a very lively one, nor the conversation very amusing\r\nto Henrietta and Frederick, as it was chiefly on the news of the country\r\nneighbourhood, in which Uncle Geoffrey showed much interest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was released from the dining-room, Henrietta ran up to\r\nher mamma, whom she found refreshed and composed. "But, O mamma, is\r\nthis a good thing for you?" said Henrietta, looking at the red case\r\ncontaining her father\'s miniature, which had evidently been only just\r\nclosed on her entrance.\r\n\r\n"The very best thing for me, dearest," was the answer, now given in her\r\nown calm tones. "It does truly make me happier than anything else. No,\r\ndon\'t look doubtful, my Henrietta; if it were repining it might hurt me,\r\nbut I trust it is not."\r\n\r\n"And does this really comfort you, mamma?" said Henrietta, as she\r\npressed the spring, and gazed thoughtfully on the portrait. "O, I cannot\r\nfancy that! the more I think, the more I try to realize what it might\r\nhave been, think what Uncle Geoffrey is to Beatrice, till sometimes, O\r\nmamma, I feel quite rebellious!"\r\n\r\n"You will be better disciplined in time, my poor child," said her\r\nmother, sadly. "As your grandmamma said, who could be so selfish as to\r\nwish him here?"\r\n\r\n"And can you bear to say so, mamma?"\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands and looked up, and Henrietta feared she had\r\ngone too far. Both were silent for some little time, until at last the\r\ndaughter timidly asked, "And was this your old room, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: look in that shelf in the corner; there are all our old childish\r\nbooks. Bring that one," she added, as Henrietta took one out, and\r\nopening it, she showed in the fly-leaf the well-written "F.H. Langford,"\r\nwith the giver\'s name; and below in round hand, scrawled all over the\r\npage, "Mary Vivian, the gift of her cousin Fred." "I believe that you\r\nmay find that in almost all of them," said she. "I am glad they have\r\nbeen spared from the children at Sutton Leigh. Will you bring me a few\r\nmore to look over, before you go down again to grandmamma?"\r\n\r\nHenrietta did not like to leave her, and lingered while she made a\r\nselection for her among the books, and from that fell into another talk,\r\nin which they were interrupted by a knock at the door, and the entrance\r\nof Mrs. Langford herself. She sat a little time, and asked of health,\r\nstrength, and diet, until she bustled off again to see if there was a\r\ngood fire in Geoffrey\'s room, telling Henrietta that tea would soon be\r\nready.\r\n\r\nHenrietta\'s ideas of grandmammas were formed on the placid Mrs.\r\nVivian, naturally rather indolent, and latterly very infirm, although\r\nconsiderably younger than Mrs. Langford; and she stood looking after in\r\nspeechless amazement, her mamma laughing at her wonder. "But, my dear\r\nchild," she said, "I beg you will go down. It will never do to have you\r\nstaying up here all the evening."\r\n\r\nHenrietta was really going this time, when as she opened the door, she\r\nwas stopped by a new visitor. This was an elderly respectable-looking\r\nmaid-servant, old Judith, whose name was well known to her. She had\r\nbeen nursery-maid at Knight Sutton at the time "Miss Mary" arrived from\r\nIndia, and was now, what in a more modernized family would have been\r\ncalled ladies\'-maid or housekeeper, but here was a nondescript office,\r\nif anything, upper housemaid. How she was loved and respected is known\r\nto all who are happy enough to possess a "Judith."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, miss," said she, as Henrietta opened the door just\r\nbefore her, and Mrs. Frederick Langford, on hearing her voice, called\r\nout, "O Judith! is that you? I was in hopes you were coming to see me."\r\n\r\nShe advanced with a courtesy, at the same time affectionately taking the\r\nthin white hand stretched out to her. "I hope you are better, ma\'am. It\r\nis something like old times to have you here again."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am very glad to be here, Judith," was the answer, "and very\r\nglad to see you looking like your own dear self."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Miss Mary; I beg your pardon, ma\'am; I wish I could see you looking\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"I shall, I hope, to-morrow, thank you, Judith. But you have not been\r\nintroduced to Henrietta, there."\r\n\r\n"But I have often heard of you, Judith," said Henrietta, cordially\r\nholding out her hand. Judith took it, and looked at her with\r\naffectionate earnestness. "Sure enough, miss," said she, "as Missus\r\nsays, you are the very picture of your mamma when she went away; but I\r\nthink I see a look of poor Master Frederick too."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen my brother, Judith?" asked Henrietta, fearing a second\r\ndiscussion on likenesses.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Henrietta; I was coming down from Missus\'s room, when\r\nMr. Geoffrey stopped me to ask how I did, and he said \'Here\'s a new\r\nacquaintance for you, Judith,\' and there was Master Frederick. I should\r\nhave known him anywhere, and he spoke so cheerful and pleasant. A fine\r\nyoung gentleman he is, to be sure."\r\n\r\n"Why, we must be like your grandchildren!" said Henrietta; "but O! here\r\ncomes Fred."\r\n\r\nAnd Judith discreetly retreated as Fred entered bearing a summons to\r\nhis sister to come down to tea, saying that he could scarcely prevail on\r\ngrandmamma to let him take the message instead of coming herself.\r\n\r\nThey found Queen Bee perched upon the arm of her grandpapa\'s chair,\r\nwith one hand holding by his collar. She had been coaxing him to say\r\nHenrietta was the prettiest girl he ever saw, and he was teasing her\r\nby declaring he should never see anything like Aunt Mary in her girlish\r\ndays. Then he called up Henrietta and Fred, and asked them about their\r\nhome doings, showing so distinct a knowledge of them, that they laughed\r\nand stood amazed. "Ah," said grandpapa, "you forgot that I had a Queen\r\nBee to enlighten me. We have plenty to tell each other, when we go\r\nbuzzing over the ploughed fields together on a sunny morning, haven\'t\r\nwe, Busy, Busy Bee?"\r\n\r\nHere grandmamma summoned them all to tea. She liked every one to sit\r\nround the table, and put away work and book, as for a regular meal, and\r\nit was rather a long one. Then, when all was over, grandpapa called out,\r\n"Come, young ladies, I\'ve been wearying for a tune these three months. I\r\nhope you are not too tired to give us one."\r\n\r\n"O no, no, grandpapa!" cried Beatrice, "but you must hear Henrietta. It\r\nis a great shame of her to play so much better than I do, with all my\r\nLondon masters too."\r\n\r\nAnd in music the greater part of the evening was passed away. Beatrice\r\ncame to her aunt\'s room to wish her good-night, and to hear\r\nHenrietta\'s opinions, which were of great delight, and still greater\r\nwonder--grandmamma so excessively kind, and grandpapa, O, he was a\r\ngrandpapa to be proud of!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an agreeable surprise to Henrietta that her mother waked free\r\nfrom headache, very cheerful, and feeling quite able to get up to\r\nbreakfast. The room looked very bright and pleasant by the first morning\r\nlight that shone upon the intricate frost-work on the window; and\r\nHenrietta, as usual, was too much lost in gazing at the branches of the\r\nelms and the last year\'s rooks\' nests, to make the most of her time;\r\nso that the bell for prayers rang long before she was ready. Her mamma\r\nwould not leave her, and remained to help her. Just as they were going\r\ndown at last, they met Mrs. Langford on her way up with inquiries for\r\npoor Mary. She would have almost been better pleased with a slight\r\nindisposition than with dawdling; but she kindly accepted Henrietta\'s\r\napologies, and there was one exclamation of joy from all the assembled\r\nparty at Mrs. Frederick Langford\'s unhoped-for entrance.\r\n\r\n"Geoffrey, my dear," began Mrs. Langford, as soon as the greetings and\r\ncongratulations were over, "will you see what is the matter with the\r\nlock of this tea-chest?--it has been out of order these three weeks, and\r\nI thought you could set it to rights."\r\n\r\nWhile Uncle Geoffrey was pronouncing on its complaints, Atkins, the old\r\nservant, put in his head.\r\n\r\n"If you please, sir, Thomas Parker would be glad to speak to Mr.\r\nGeoffrey about his son on the railway."\r\n\r\nAway went Mr. Geoffrey to the lower regions, where Thomas Parker awaited\r\nhim, and as soon as he returned was addressed by his father: "Geoffrey,\r\nI put those papers on the table in the study, if you will look over them\r\nwhen you have time, and tell me what you think of the turnpike trust."\r\n\r\nA few moments after the door was thrown wide open, and in burst three\r\nboys, shouting with one voice--"Uncle Geoffrey, Uncle Geoffrey, you must\r\ncome and see which of Vixen\'s puppies are to be saved!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, you rogues, hush!" was Uncle Geoffrey\'s answer; "don\'t you\r\nknow that you are come into civilized society? Aunt Mary never saw such\r\nwild men of the woods."\r\n\r\n"All crazy at the sight of Uncle Geoffrey," said grandmamma. "Ah, he\r\nspoils you all! but, come here, Johnny, come and speak to your aunt.\r\nThere, this is Johnny, and here are Richard and Willie," she added, as\r\nthey came up and awkwardly gave their hands to their aunt and cousins.\r\n\r\nHenrietta was almost bewildered by seeing so many likenesses of\r\nAlexander. "How shall I ever know them apart?" said she to Beatrice.\r\n\r\n"Like grandmamma\'s nest of teacups, all alike, only each one size below\r\nanother," said Beatrice. "However, I don\'t require you to learn them all\r\nat once; only to know Alex and Willie from the rest. Here, Willie, have\r\nyou nothing to say to me? How are the rabbits?"\r\n\r\nWillie, a nice-looking boy of nine or ten years old, of rather slighter\r\nmake than his brothers, and with darker eyes and hair, came to Queen\r\nBee\'s side, as if he was very glad to see her, and only slightly\r\ndiscomposed by Henrietta\'s neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nJohn gave the information that papa and Alex were only just behind, and\r\nin another minute they made their appearance. "Good morning sir; good\r\nmorning, ma\'am," were Uncle Roger\'s greetings, as he came in. "Ah, Mary,\r\nhow d\'ye do? glad to see you here at last; hope you are better.---Ah,\r\ngood morning, good morning," as he quickly shook hands with the younger\r\nones. "Good morning, Geoffrey; I told Martin to take the new drill into\r\nthe outfield, for I want your opinion whether it is worth keeping."\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon the three gentlemen began a learned discussion on drills,\r\nduring which Henrietta studied her uncle. She was at first surprised to\r\nsee him look so young--younger, she thought, than Uncle Geoffrey; but\r\nin a moment or two she changed her mind, for though mental labour had\r\nthinned and grizzled Uncle Geoffrey\'s hair, paled his cheek, and traced\r\nlines of thought on his broad high brow, it had not quenched the light\r\nthat beamed in his eyes, nor subdued the joyous merriment that often\r\nplayed over his countenance, according with the slender active figure\r\nthat might have belonged to a mere boy. Uncle Roger was taller, and\r\nmuch more robust and broad; his hair still untouched with grey, his face\r\nruddy brown, and his features full of good nature, but rather heavy. In\r\nhis plaid shooting coat and high gaiters, as he stood by the fire, he\r\nlooked the model of a country squire; but there was an indescribable\r\nfamily likeness, and something of the same form about the nose and\r\nlip, which recalled to Henrietta the face she loved so well in Uncle\r\nGeoffrey.\r\n\r\nThe drill discussion was not concluded when Mrs. Langford gave the\r\nsignal for the ladies to leave the breakfast table. Henrietta ran up\r\nstairs for her mother\'s work, and came down again laughing. "I am sure,\r\nQueenie," said she, "that your papa chose his trade rightly. He may\r\nwell be called a great counsel. Besides all the opinions asked of him at\r\nbreakfast, I have just come across a consultation on the stairs between\r\nhim and Judith about--what was it?--some money in a savings\' bank."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Beatrice, "Judith has saved a sum that is wondrous in these\r\ndegenerate days of maids in silk gowns, and she is wise enough to give\r\n\'Master Geoffrey\' all the management of it. But if you are surprised\r\nnow, what will you be by the end of the day? See if his advice is not\r\nasked in at least fifty matters."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll count," said Henrietta: "what have we had already?" and she took\r\nout pencil and paper--"Number one, the tea-chest; then the poor man, and\r\nthe turnpike trust--"\r\n\r\n"Vixen\'s puppies and the drill," suggested her mamma.\r\n\r\n"And Judith\'s money," added Henrietta. "Six already--"\r\n\r\n"To say nothing of all that will come by the post, and we shall not hear\r\nof," said Beatrice; "and look here, what I am going to seal for him,\r\none, two, three--eight letters."\r\n\r\n"Why! when could he possibly have written them?"\r\n\r\n"Last night after we were gone to bed. It shows how much more grandmamma\r\nwill let him do than any one else, that she can allow him to sit up\r\nwith a candle after eleven o\'clock. I really believe that there is not\r\nanother living creature in the world who could do it in this house.\r\nThere, you may add your own affairs to the list, Henrietta, for he is\r\ngoing to the Pleasance to meet some man of brick and mortar."\r\n\r\n"O, I wish we could walk there!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say we can. I\'ll manage. Aunt Mary, should you not like\r\nHenrietta to go and see the Pleasance?"\r\n\r\n"Almost as much as Henrietta would like it herself, Busy Bee," said Aunt\r\nMary; "but I think she should walk to Sutton Leigh to-day."\r\n\r\n"Walk to Sutton Leigh!" echoed old Mrs. Langford, entering at the\r\nmoment; "not you, surely, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"O no, no, grandmamma," said Beatrice, laughing; "she was only talking\r\nof Henrietta\'s doing it."\r\n\r\n"Well, and so do, my dears; it will be a very nice thing, if you go this\r\nmorning before the frost goes off. Your Aunt Roger will like to see you,\r\nand you may take the little pot of black currant jelly that I wanted to\r\nsend over for poor Tom\'s sore mouth."\r\n\r\nBeatrice looked at Henrietta and made a face of disgust as she asked,\r\n"Have they no currant jelly themselves?"\r\n\r\n"O no, they never can keep anything in the garden. I don\'t mean that the\r\nboys take the fruit; but between tarts and puddings and desserts, poor\r\nElizabeth can never make any preserves."\r\n\r\n"But," objected Queen Bee, "if one of the children is ill, do you think\r\nAunt Roger will like to have us this morning? and the post girl could\r\ntake the jelly."\r\n\r\n"O nonsense, Bee," said Mrs. Langford, somewhat angrily; "you don\'t\r\nlike to do it, I see plain enough. It is very hard you can\'t be as\r\ngood-natured to your own little cousin as to one of the children in the\r\nvillage."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, grandmamma, I did not mean that."\r\n\r\n"O no, no, grandmamma," joined in Henrietta, "we shall be very glad to\r\ntake it. Pray let us."\r\n\r\n"Yes," added Beatrice, "if it is really to be of any use, no one can be\r\nmore willing."\r\n\r\n"Of any use?" repeated Mrs. Langford. "No! never mind. I\'ll send\r\nsomeone."\r\n\r\n"No, pray do not, dear grandmamma," eagerly exclaimed Henrietta; "I do\r\nbeg you will let us take it. It will be making me at home directly to\r\nlet me be useful."\r\n\r\nGrandmamma was pacified. "When will you set out?" she asked; "you had\r\nbetter not lose this bright morning."\r\n\r\n"We will go directly," said Queen Bee; "we will go by the west turning,\r\nso that Henrietta may see the Pleasance."\r\n\r\n"My dear! the west turning will be a swamp, and I won\'t have you getting\r\nwet in your feet and catching cold."\r\n\r\n"O, we have clogs; and besides, the road does not get so dirty since it\r\nhas been mended. I asked Johnny this morning."\r\n\r\n"As if he knew, or cared anything about it!--and you will be late for\r\nluncheon. Besides, grandpapa will drive your aunt there the first day\r\nshe feels equal to it, and Henrietta may see it then. But you will\r\nalways have your own way."\r\n\r\nHenrietta had seldom been more uncomfortable than during this\r\naltercation; and but for reluctance to appear more obliging than her\r\ncousin, she would have begged to give up the scheme. Her mother would\r\nhave interfered in another moment, but the entrance of Uncle Geoffrey\r\ngave a sudden turn to affairs.\r\n\r\n"Who likes to go to the Pleasance?" said he, as he entered. "All whose\r\ncuriosity lies that way may prepare their seven-leagued boots."\r\n\r\n"Here are the girls dying to go," said Mrs. Langford, as well pleased as\r\nif she had not been objecting the minute before.\r\n\r\n"Very well. We go by Sutton Leigh: so make haste, maidens." Then,\r\nturning to his mother, "Didn\'t I hear you say you had something to send\r\nto Elizabeth, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"Only some currant jelly for little Tom; but if--"\r\n\r\n"O grandmamma, that is my charge; pray don\'t cheat me," exclaimed\r\nHenrietta. "If you will lend me a basket, it will travel much better\r\nwith me than in Uncle Geoffrey\'s pocket."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that will be the proper division of labour," said Uncle Geoffrey,\r\nlooking well pleased with his niece; "but I thought you were off to get\r\nready."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t keep your uncle waiting, my dear," added her mamma; and Henrietta\r\ndeparted, Beatrice following her to her room, and there exclaiming, "If\r\nthere is a thing I can\'t endure, it is going to Sutton Leigh when one of\r\nthe children is poorly! It is always bad enough--"\r\n\r\n"Bad enough! O, Busy Bee!" cried Henrietta, quite unprepared to hear of\r\nany flaw in her paradise.\r\n\r\n"You will soon see what I mean. The host of boys in the way; the wooden\r\nbricks and black horses spotted with white wafers that you break your\r\nshins over, the marbles that roll away under your feet, the whips that\r\ncrack in your ears, the universal air of nursery that pervades the\r\nhouse. It is worse in the morning, too; for one is always whining over\r\nsum, es, est, and another over his spelling. O, if I had eleven brothers\r\nin a small house, I should soon turn misanthrope. But you are laughing\r\ninstead of getting ready."\r\n\r\n"So are you."\r\n\r\n"My things will be on in a quarter of the time you take. I\'ll tell you\r\nwhat, Henrietta, the Queen Bee allows no drones, and I shall teach you\r\nto \'improve each shining hour;\' for nothing will get you into such dire\r\ndisgrace here as to be always behind time. Besides, it is a great shame\r\nto waste papa\'s time. Now, here is your shawl ready folded, and now I\r\nwill trust you to put on your boots and bonnet by yourself."\r\n\r\nIn five minutes the Queen Bee flew back again, and found Henrietta still\r\nmeasuring the length of her bonnet strings before the glass. She hunted\r\nher down stairs at last, and found the two uncles and grandpapa at\r\nthe door, playing with the various dogs, small and great, that usually\r\nwaited there. Fred and the other boys had gone out together some time\r\nsince, and the party now set forth, the three gentlemen walking together\r\nfirst. Henrietta turned as soon as she had gone a sufficient distance\r\nthat she might study the aspect of the house. It did not quite fulfil\r\nher expectations; it was neither remarkable for age nor beauty; the\r\nmasonry was in a sort of chessboard pattern, alternate squares of\r\nfreestone and of flints, the windows were not casements as she thought\r\nthey ought to have been, and the long wing, or rather excrescence,\r\nwhich contained the drawing-room, was by no means ornamental. It was a\r\nrespectable, comfortable mansion, and that was all that was to be\r\nsaid in its praise, and Beatrice\'s affection had so embellished it\r\nin description, that it was no wonder that Henrietta felt slightly\r\ndisappointed. She had had some expectation, too, of seeing it in the\r\nmidst of a park, instead of which the carriage-drive along which they\r\nwere walking, only skirted a rather large grass field, full of elm\r\ntrees, and known by the less dignified name of the paddock. But she\r\nwould not confess the failure of her expectations even to herself, and\r\nas Beatrice was evidently looking for some expressions of admiration,\r\nshe said the road must be very pretty in summer.\r\n\r\n"Especially when this bank is one forest of foxgloves," said Queen Bee.\r\n"Only think! Uncle Roger and the farmer faction wanted grandpapa to have\r\nthis hedge row grubbed up, and turned into a plain dead fence; but I\r\ncarried the day, and I dare say Aunt Mary will be as much obliged to\r\nme as the boys who would have lost their grand preserve of stoats and\r\nrabbits. But here are the outfield and the drill."\r\n\r\nAnd going through a small gate at the corner of the paddock, they\r\nentered a large ploughed field, traversed by a footpath raised and\r\ngravelled, so as to be high and dry, which was well for the two girls,\r\nas the gentlemen left them to march up and down there by themselves,\r\nwhilst they were discussing the merits of the brilliant blue machine\r\nwhich was travelling along the furrows. It was rather a trial of\r\npatience, but Beatrice was used to it, and Henrietta was in a temper to\r\nbe pleased with anything.\r\n\r\nAt last the inspection was concluded, and Mr. Langford came to his\r\ngranddaughters, leaving his two sons to finish their last words with\r\nMartin.\r\n\r\n"Well, young ladies," said he, "this is fine drilling, in patience at\r\nleast. I only wish my wheat may be as well drilled with Uncle Roger\'s\r\nnew-fangled machines."\r\n\r\n"That is right, grandpapa," said Queen Bee; "you hate them as much as I\r\ndo, don\'t you now?"\r\n\r\n"She is afraid they will make honey by steam," said grandpapa, "and\r\nrender bees a work of supererogation."\r\n\r\n"They are doing what they can towards it," said Beatrice. "Why, when Mr.\r\nCarey took us to see his hives, I declare I had quite a fellow-feeling\r\nfor my poor subjects, boxed up in glass, with all their privacy\r\ndestroyed. And they won\'t even let them swarm their own way--a most\r\nunwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject."\r\n\r\n"Well done, Queenie," said Mr. Langford, laughing; "a capital champion.\r\nAnd so you don\'t look forward to the time when we are to have our hay\r\nmade by one machine, our sheep washed by another, our turkeys crammed by\r\na third--ay, and even the trouble of bird-starving saved us?"\r\n\r\n"Bird-starving!" repeated Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Yes; or keeping a few birds, according to the mother\'s elegant\r\ndiminutive," said Beatrice, "serving as live scarecrows."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought a scarecrow would have answered the purpose,"\r\nsaid Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"This is one that is full of gunpowder, and fires off every ten\r\nminutes," said grandpapa; "but I told Uncle Roger we would have none\r\nof them here unless he was prepared to see one of his boys blown up at\r\nevery third explosion."\r\n\r\n"Is Uncle Roger so very fond of machines?" said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"He goes about to cattle shows and agricultural meetings, and comes home\r\nwith his pockets crammed with papers of new inventions, which I leave\r\nhim to try as long as he does not empty my pockets too fast."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they succeed, then?" said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Why--ay--I must confess we get decent crops enough. And once we\r\nachieved a prize ox,--such a disgusting overgrown beast, that I could\r\nnot bear the sight of it; and told Uncle Roger I would have no more such\r\nwaste of good victuals, puffing up the ox instead of the frog."\r\n\r\nHenrietta was not quite certain whether all this was meant in jest or\r\nearnest; and perhaps the truth was, that though grandpapa had little\r\nliking for new plans, he was too wise not to adopt those which possessed\r\nmanifest advantage, and only indulged himself in a good deal of playful\r\ngrumbling, which greatly teased Uncle Roger.\r\n\r\n"There is Sutton Leigh," said grandpapa, as they came in sight of a low\r\nwhite house among farm buildings. "Well, Henrietta, are you prepared for\r\nan introduction to an aunt and half-a-dozen cousins, and Jessie Carey\r\ninto the bargain?"\r\n\r\n"Jessie Carey!" exclaimed Beatrice in a tone of dismay.\r\n\r\n"Did you not know she was there? Why they always send Carey over for her\r\nwith the gig if there is but a tooth-ache the matter at Sutton Leigh."\r\n\r\n"Is she one of Aunt Roger\'s nieces?" asked Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Beatrice. "And--O! grandpapa, don\'t look at me in that way.\r\nWhere is the use of being your pet, if I may not tell my mind?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t have Henrietta prejudiced," said Mr. Langford. "Don\'t listen to\r\nher, my dear: and I\'ll tell you what Jessie Carey is. She is an honest,\r\ngood-natured girl as ever lived; always ready to help every one, never\r\nthinking of trouble, without an atom of selfishness."\r\n\r\n"Now for the but, grandpapa," cried Beatrice. "I allow all that, only\r\ngrant me the but."\r\n\r\n"But Queen Bee, chancing to be a conceited little Londoner, looks down\r\non us poor country folks as unfit for her most refined and intellectual\r\nsociety."\r\n\r\n"O grandpapa, that is not fair! Indeed, you don\'t really believe that.\r\nO, say you don\'t!" And Beatrice\'s black eyes were full of tears.\r\n\r\n"If I do not believe the whole, you believe the half, Miss Bee," and he\r\nadded, half whispering, "take care some of us do not believe the other\r\nhalf. But don\'t look dismal on the matter, only put it into one of your\r\nwaxen cells, and don\'t lose sight of it. And if it is any comfort to\r\nyou, I will allow that perhaps poor Jessie is not the most entertaining\r\ncompanion for you. Her vanity maggots are not of the same sort as\r\nyours."\r\n\r\nThey had by this time nearly reached Sutton Leigh, a building little\r\naltered from the farm-house it had originally been, with a small garden\r\nin front, and a narrow footpath up to the door. As soon as they came in\r\nsight there was a general rush forward of little boys in brown holland,\r\nall darting on Uncle Geoffrey, and holding him fast by legs and arms.\r\n\r\n"Let me loose, you varlets," he cried, and disengaging one hand, in\r\nanother moment drew from his capacious pocket a beautiful red ball,\r\nwhich he sent bounding over their heads, and dancing far away with all\r\nthe urchins in pursuit.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the rosy, portly, good-humoured Mrs. Roger Langford\r\nappeared at the door, welcoming them cordially, and, as usual, accusing\r\nUncle Geoffrey of spoiling her boys. Henrietta thought she had never\r\nseen a happier face than hers in the midst of cares, and children, and\r\na drawing-room which, with its faded furniture strewn with toys, had in\r\nfact, as Beatrice said, something of the appearance of a nursery.\r\n\r\nLittle Tom, the youngest, was sitting on the lap of his cousin, Jessie\r\nCarey, at whom Henrietta looked with some curiosity. She was a pretty\r\ngirl of twenty, with a brilliant gipsy complexion, fine black hair, and\r\na face which looked as good-natured as every other inhabitant of Sutton\r\nLeigh.\r\n\r\nBut it would be tedious to describe a visit which was actually very\r\ntedious to Beatrice, and would have been the same to Henrietta but\r\nfor its novelty. Aunt Roger asked all particulars about Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford, then of Aunt Geoffrey and Lady Susan St. Leger, and then gave\r\nthe history of the misfortunes of little Tom, who was by this time on\r\nUncle Geoffrey\'s knee looking at himself in the inside of the case of\r\nhis watch. Henrietta\'s list, too, was considerably lengthened; for Uncle\r\nGeoffrey advised upon a smoky chimney, mended a cart of Charlie\'s, and\r\nassisted Willie in a puzzling Latin exercise.\r\n\r\nIt was almost one o\'clock, and as a certain sound of clattering plates\r\nwas heard in the next room, Aunt Roger begged her guests to come in to\r\nluncheon. Uncle Geoffrey accepted for the girls, who were to walk on\r\nwith him; but Mr. Langford, no eater of luncheons, returned to his own\r\naffairs at home. Henrietta found the meal was the family dinner. She had\r\nhardly ever been seated at one so plain, or on so long a table; and she\r\nwas not only surprised, but tormented herself by an uncomfortable and\r\nuncalled-for fancy, that her hosts must be supposing her to be remarking\r\non deficiencies. The younger children were not so perfect in the\r\nmanagement of knife, fork, and spoon, as to be pleasant to watch; nor\r\nwas the matter mended by the attempts at correction made from time\r\nto time by their father and Jessie. But Henrietta endured better\r\nthan Beatrice, whose face ill concealed an expression of disgust and\r\nweariness, and who maintained a silence very unlike her usual habits.\r\n\r\nAt last Uncle Geoffrey, to the joy of both, proposed to pursue their\r\nwalk, and they took leave. Queen Bee rejoiced as soon as they had\r\nquitted the house, that the boys were too well occupied with their\r\npudding to wish to accompany them, but she did not venture on any\r\nfurther remarks before her papa. He gave a long whistle, and then turned\r\nto point out all the interesting localities to Henrietta. There was\r\nsomething to tell of every field, every tree, or every villager, with\r\nwhom he exchanged his hearty greeting. If it were only a name, it\r\nrecalled some story of mamma\'s, some tradition handed on by Beatrice.\r\nNever was walk more delightful; and the girls were almost sorry to find\r\nthemselves at the green gate of the Pleasance, leading to a gravel\r\nroad, great part of which had been usurped by the long shoots of the\r\nevergreens. Indeed, the place could hardly be said to correspond in\r\nappearance to its name, in its chilly, deserted, unfurnished state; but\r\nthe girls were resolved to admire, and while Uncle Geoffrey was deep in\r\nthe subject of repairs and deficiencies, they flitted about from garret\r\nto cellar, making plans, fixing on rooms, and seeing possibilities, in\r\ncomplete enjoyment. But even this could not last for ever; and rather\r\ntired, and very cold, they seated themselves on a step of the stairs,\r\nand there built a marvellous castle of delight for next summer; then\r\ntalked over the Sutton Leigh household, discussed the last books they\r\nhad read, and had just begun to yawn, when Uncle Geoffrey, being more\r\nmerciful than most busy men, concluded his business, and summoned them\r\nto return home. Their homeward walk was by a different road, through the\r\nvillage of Knight Sutton itself, which Henrietta had not yet seen. It\r\nwas a long straggling street, the cottages for the most part in gardens,\r\nand with a general look of comfort and neatness that showed the care of\r\nthe proprietor.\r\n\r\n"O, here is the church," said Henrietta, in a subdued voice, as they\r\ncame to the low flint wall that fenced in the slightly rising ground\r\noccupied by the churchyard, surrounded by a whole grove of noble elm\r\ntrees, amongst which could just be seen the small old church, with its\r\nlarge deep porch and curious low tower.\r\n\r\n"The door is open," said Beatrice; "I suppose they are bringing in the\r\nholly for Christmas. Should you like to look in, Henrietta?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know," said she, looking at her uncle. "Mamma--"\r\n\r\n"I think it might be less trying if she has not to feel for you and\r\nherself too," said Uncle Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I should wish it very much," said Henrietta, and they entered\r\nthe low, dark, solemn-looking building, the massive stone columns and\r\nlow-browed arches of which had in them something peculiarly awful and\r\nimpressive to Henrietta\'s present state of mind. Uncle Geoffrey led her\r\non into the chancel, where, among numerous mural tablets recording\r\nthe names of different members of the Langford family, was one chiefly\r\nnoticeable for the superior taste of its Gothic canopy, and which bore\r\nthe name of Frederick Henry Langford, with the date of his death, and\r\nhis age, only twenty-six. One of the large flat stones below also had\r\nthe initials F.H.L., and the date of the year. Henrietta stood and\r\nlooked in deep silence, Beatrice watching her earnestly and kindly, and\r\nher uncle\'s thoughts almost as much as hers, on what might have been.\r\nHer father had been so near him in age, so constantly his companion, so\r\nentirely one in mind and temper, that he had been far more to him than\r\nhis elder brother, and his death had been the one great sorrow of Uncle\r\nGeoffrey\'s life.\r\n\r\nThe first sound which broke the stillness was the opening of the\r\ndoor, as the old clerk\'s wife entered with a huge basket of holly, and\r\ndragging a mighty branch behind her. Uncle Geoffrey nodded in reply to\r\nher courtesy, and gave his daughter a glance which sent her to the other\r\nend of the church to assist in the Christmas decorations.\r\n\r\nHenrietta turned her liquid eyes upon her uncle. "This is coming very\r\nnear him!" said she in a low voice. "Uncle; I wish I might be quite sure\r\nthat he knows me."\r\n\r\n"Do not wish too much for certainty which has not been granted to us,"\r\nsaid Uncle Geoffrey. "Think rather of \'I shall go to him, but he shall\r\nnot return to me.\'"\r\n\r\n"But, uncle, you would not have me not believe that he is near to me\r\nand knows how--how I would have loved him, and how I do love him," she\r\nadded, while the tears rose to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"It may be so, my dear, and it is a thought which is not only most\r\ncomforting, but good for us, as bringing us closer to the unseen world:\r\nbut it has not been positively revealed, and it seems to me better to\r\ndwell on that time when the meeting with him is so far certain that it\r\ndepends but on ourselves."\r\n\r\nTo many persons, Uncle Geoffrey would scarce have spoken in this way;\r\nbut he was aware of a certain tendency in Henrietta\'s mind to merge the\r\nreverence and respect she owed to her parents, in a dreamy unpractical\r\nfeeling for the father whom she had never known, whose voice she had\r\nnever heard, and from whom she had not one precept to obey; while she\r\nlost sight of that honour and duty which was daily called for towards\r\nher mother. It was in honour, not in love, that Henrietta was wanting,\r\nand with how many daughters is it not the same? It was therefore,\r\nthat though even to himself it seemed harsh, and cost him a pang, Mr.\r\nGeoffrey Langford resolved that his niece\'s first visit to her father\'s\r\ngrave should not be spent in fruitless dreams of him or of his presence,\r\nalluring because involving neither self-reproach nor resolution; but in\r\nthoughts which might lead to action, to humility, and to the yielding up\r\nof self-will.\r\n\r\nHenrietta looked very thoughtful. "That time is so far away!" said she.\r\n\r\n"How do you know that?" said her uncle in the deep low tone that brought\r\nthe full perception that "it is nigh, even at the doors."\r\n\r\nShe gave a sort of shuddering sigh, the reality being doubly brought\r\nhome to her, by the remembrance of the suddenness of her father\'s\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\n"It is awful," she said. "I cannot bear to think of it."\r\n\r\n"Henrietta," said her uncle solemnly, "guard yourself from being so\r\nsatisfied with a dream of the present as to lose sight of the real,\r\nmost real future." He paused, and as she did not speak, went on: "The\r\npresent, which is the means of attaining to that future, is one not of\r\nvisions and thoughts, but of deeds."\r\n\r\nAgain Henrietta sighed, but presently she said, "But, uncle, that would\r\nbring us back to the world of sense. Are we not to pray that we may in\r\nheart and mind ascend?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but to dwell with Whom? Not to stop short with objects once of\r\nearthly affection."\r\n\r\n"Then would you not have me think of him at all?" said she, almost\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n"I would have you take care, Henrietta, lest the thought should absorb\r\nthe love and trust due to your true and Heavenly Father, and at the same\r\ntime you forget what on earth is owed to your mother. Do you think that\r\nis what your father would desire?"\r\n\r\n"You mean," she said sadly, "that while I do not think enough of God,\r\nand while I love my own way so well, I have no right to dwell on the\r\nthought I love best, the thought that he is near."\r\n\r\n"Take it rather as a caution than as blame," said Uncle Geoffrey. A long\r\nsilence ensued, during which Henrietta thought deeply on the new idea\r\nopened to her. Her vision, for it could not be called her memory of\r\nher father, had in fact been too highly enshrined in her mind, too much\r\nworshipped, she had deemed this devotion a virtue, and fostered as it\r\nwas by the solitude of her life, and the temper of her mother\'s mind,\r\nthe truth was as Uncle Geoffrey had hinted, and she began to perceive\r\nit, but still it was most unwillingly, for the thought was cherished\r\nso as to be almost part of herself. Uncle Geoffrey\'s manner was so kind\r\nthat she could not be vexed with him, but she was disappointed, for she\r\nhad hoped for a narration of some part of her father\'s history, and for\r\nthe indulgence of that soft sorrow which has in it little pain. Instead\r\nof this she was bidden to quit her beloved world, to soar above it,\r\nor to seek for a duty which she had rather not believe that she had\r\nneglected, though--no, she did not like to look deeper.\r\n\r\nMr. Geoffrey Langford gave her time for thought, though of what nature\r\nit might be, he could not guess, and then said, "One thing more before\r\nwe leave this place. Whether Fred cheerfully obeys the fifth commandment\r\nin its full extent, may often, as I believe, depend on your influence.\r\nWill you try to exert it in the right way?"\r\n\r\n"You mean when he wishes to do things like other boys of his age," said\r\nHenrietta.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Think yourself, and lead him to think, that obedience is better\r\nthan what he fancies manliness. Teach him to give up pleasure for the\r\nsake of obedience, and you will do your work as a sister and daughter."\r\n\r\nWhile Uncle Geoffrey was speaking, Beatrice\'s operations with the holly\r\nhad brought her a good deal nearer to them, and at the same time the\r\nchurch door opened, and a gentleman entered, whom the first glance\r\nshowed Henrietta to be Mr. Franklin, the clergyman of the parish, of\r\nwhom she had heard so much. He advanced on seeing Beatrice with the\r\nholly in her hand. "Miss Langford! This is just what I was wishing."\r\n\r\n"I was just helping old Martha," said Beatrice; "we came in to show my\r\ncousin the church, and--"\r\n\r\nBy this time the others had advanced.\r\n\r\n"How well the church looks this dark afternoon," said Uncle Geoffrey,\r\nspeaking in a low tone, "it is quite the moment to choose for seeing\r\nit for the first time. But you are very early in beginning your\r\nadornments."\r\n\r\n"I thought if I had the evergreens here in time, I might see a little to\r\nthe arrangement myself," said Mr. Franklin, "but I am afraid I know very\r\nlittle about the matter. Miss Langford, I wish you would assist us with\r\nyour taste."\r\n\r\nBeatrice and Henrietta looked at each other, and their eyes sparkled\r\nwith delight. "I should like it exceedingly," said the former; "I was\r\njust thinking what capabilities there are. And Henrietta will do it\r\nbeautifully."\r\n\r\n"Then will you really be kind enough to come to-morrow, and see what can\r\nbe done?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we will come as soon as ever breakfast is over, and work hard,"\r\nsaid Queen Bee. "And we will make Alex and Fred come too, to do the\r\nplaces that are out of reach."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you," said Mr. Franklin, eagerly; "I assure you the\r\nmatter was quite upon my mind, for the old lady there, good as she is,\r\ncertainly has not the best taste in church dressing."\r\n\r\n"And pray, Mr. Franklin, let us have a step ladder, for I am sure there\r\nought to be festoons round those two columns of the chancel arch. Look,\r\npapa, do you not think so?"\r\n\r\n"You might put a twining wreath like the columns at Roslin chapel," said\r\nher papa, "and I should try how much I could cover the Dutch cherubs at\r\nthe head of the tables of commandments."\r\n\r\n"O, and don\'t you see," said Henrietta, "there in front of the altar\r\nis a space, where I really think we might make the cross and \'I H S\' in\r\nholly?"\r\n\r\n"But could you, Henrietta?" asked Beatrice.\r\n\r\n"O yes, I know I can; I made \'M.L.\' in roses on mamma\'s last birthday,\r\nand set it up over the chimney-piece in the drawing-room, and I am sure\r\nwe could contrive this. How appropriate it will look!"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Mr. Franklin, "I have heard of such things, but I had always\r\nconsidered them as quite above our powers."\r\n\r\n"They would be, without Henrietta," said Queen Bee, "but she was always\r\nexcellent as wreath weaving, and all those things that belong to choice\r\ntaste and clever fingers. Only let us have plenty of the wherewithal,\r\nand we will do our work so as to amaze the parish."\r\n\r\n"And now," said Uncle Geoffrey, "we must be walking home, my young\r\nladies. It is getting quite dark."\r\n\r\nIt was indeed, for as they left the church the sunlight was fast fading\r\non the horizon, and Venus was already shining forth in pure quiet beauty\r\non the clear blue sky. Mr. Franklin walked a considerable part of the\r\nway home with them, adding to Henrietta\'s list by asking counsel about\r\na damp spot in the wall of the church, and on the measures to be adopted\r\nwith a refractory farmer.\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached home, evening was fast closing in; and at the\r\nsound of their entrance Mrs. Langford and Frederick both came to meet\r\nthem in the hall, the former asking anxiously whether they had not been\r\nlingering in the cold and damp, inspecting the clogs to see that they\r\nwere dry, and feeling if the fingers were cold. She then ordered the two\r\ngirls up stairs to dress before going into the drawing-room with their\r\nthings on, and told Henrietta to remember that dinner would be at\r\nhalf-past five.\r\n\r\n"Is mamma gone up?" asked Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, long ago; she has been out with your grandpapa, and is\r\ngone to rest herself."\r\n\r\n"And how long have you been at home, Fred?" said Queen Bee. "Why, you\r\nhave performed your toilette already! Why did you not come to meet us?"\r\n\r\n"I should have had a long spy-glass to see which way you were gone,"\r\nsaid Fred, in a tone which, to Henrietta\'s ears, implied that he was not\r\nquite pleased, and then, following his sister up stairs, he went on to\r\nher, "I wish I had never come in, but it was about three, and Alex and\r\nCarey thought we might as well get a bit of something for luncheon, and\r\nthereby they had the pleasure of seeing mamma send her pretty dear up to\r\nchange his shoes and stockings. So there was an end of me for the day.\r\nI declare it is getting too absurd! Do persuade mamma that I am not made\r\nof sugar candy."\r\n\r\nWith Uncle Geoffrey\'s admonitions fresh in her mind, these complaints\r\nsounded painfully in Henrietta\'s ears, and she would gladly have soothed\r\naway his irritation; but, however convenient Judith might find the\r\nstairs for private conferences, they did not appear to her equally\r\nappropriate, especially when at the very moment grandpapa was coming\r\ndown from above and grandmamma up from below. Both she and Fred\r\ntherefore retreated into their mamma\'s room, where they found her\r\nsitting on a low stool by the fire, reading by its light one of the old\r\nchildish books, of which she seemed never to weary. Fred\'s petulance,\r\nto do him justice, never could endure the charm of her presence, and his\r\nbrow was as bright and open as his sister\'s as he came forward, hoping\r\nthat she was not tired.\r\n\r\n"Quite the contrary, thank you, my dear," said she, smiling; "I enjoyed\r\nmy walk exceedingly."\r\n\r\n"A walk!" exclaimed Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"A crawl, perhaps you would call it, but a delightful crawl it was with\r\ngrandpapa up and down what we used to call the sun walk, by the kitchen\r\ngarden wall. And now, Pussy-cat, Pussy-cat, where have you been?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been to Sutton Leigh, with the good Queen," answered Henrietta,\r\ngaily. "I have seen everything--Sutton Leigh, and the Pleasance, and the\r\nchurch! And, mamma, Mr. Franklin has asked us to go and dress the church\r\nfor Christmas! Is not that what of all things is delightful? Only think\r\nof church-decking! What I have read and heard of, but I always thought\r\nit something too great and too happy for me ever to do."\r\n\r\n"I hope you will be able to succeed in it," said her mamma. "What a\r\ntreat it will be to see your work on Sunday."\r\n\r\n"And you are to help, too, Fred; you and Alexander are to come and reach\r\nthe high places for us. But do tell us your adventures."\r\n\r\nFred had been all over the farm; had been introduced to the whole\r\nlive stock, including ferrets and the tame hedge-hog; visited the\r\nplantations, and assisted at the killing of a stoat; cut his name out on\r\nthe bark of the old pollard; and, in short, had been supremely happy.\r\nHe "was just going to see Dumpling and Vixen\'s puppies at Sutton Leigh,\r\nwhen--"\r\n\r\n"When I caught you, my poor boy," said his mamma; "and very cruel it\r\nwas, I allow, but I thought you might have gone out again."\r\n\r\n"I had no other thick shoes upstairs; but really, mamma, no one thinks\r\nof minding those things."\r\n\r\n"You should have seen him, Henrietta," said his mother; "his shoes\r\nlooked as if he had been walking through a river."\r\n\r\n"Well, but so were all the others," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Very likely, but they are more used to it; and, besides, they are such\r\nsturdy fellows. I should as soon think of a deal board catching cold.\r\nBut you--if there is as much substance in you, it is all height; and you\r\nknow, Fred, you would find it considerably more tiresome to be laid up\r\nwith a bad cold."\r\n\r\n"I never catch cold," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Boys always say so," said Mrs. Frederick Langford; "it is a--what shall\r\nI call it?--a puerile delusion, which their mammas can always defeat\r\nwhen they choose by a formidable list of colds and coughs; but I won\'t\r\nput you in mind of how often you have sat with your feet on the fender\r\ncroaking like an old raven, and solacing yourself with stick-liquorice\r\nand Ivanhoe."\r\n\r\n"You had better allow him to proceed in his pursuit of a cold, mamma,"\r\nsaid Henrietta, "just to see how grandmamma will nurse it."\r\n\r\nA knock at the door here put an end to the conversation, by announcing\r\nthe arrival of Bennet, Mrs. Frederick Langford\'s maid; who had come in\r\nsuch good time that Henrietta was, for once in her life, full dressed\r\na whole quarter of an hour before dinner time. Nor was her involuntary\r\npunctuality without a reward, for the interval of waiting for dinner,\r\nsitting round the fire, was particularly enjoyed by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLangford; and Uncle Geoffrey, therefore, always contrived to make it a\r\nleisure time; and there was so much merriment in talking over the walk,\r\nand discussing the plans for the Pleasance, that Henrietta resolved\r\nnever again to miss such a pleasant reunion by her own tardiness.\r\n\r\nNor was the evening less agreeable. Henrietta pleased grandmamma by\r\ngetting her carpet-work out of some puzzle, and by flying across the\r\nroom to fetch the tea-chest: she delighted grandpapa by her singing, and\r\nby finding his spectacles for him; she did quite a praiseworthy piece of\r\nher own crochet purse, and laughed a great deal at the battle that was\r\ngoing on between Queen Bee and Fred about the hero of some new book.\r\nShe kept her list of Uncle Geoffrey\'s manifold applicants on the table\r\nbefore her, and had the pleasure of increasing it by two men, business\r\nunknown, who sent to ask him to come and speak to them; by a loud\r\nand eager appeal from Fred and Beatrice to decide their contest, by a\r\nquestion of taste on the shades of grandmamma\'s carpet-work, and by her\r\nown query how to translate a difficult German passage which had baffled\r\nherself, mamma, and Fred.\r\n\r\nHowever, Queen Bee\'s number, fifty, had not been attained, and her\r\nmajesty was obliged to declare that she meant in a week instead of\r\na day, for which reason the catalogue was written out fair, to be\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick Langford thought herself well recompensed for the pain\r\nher resolution had cost her, by the pleasure that Mr. and Mrs. Langford\r\nevidently took in her son and daughter, by the brightness of her two\r\nchildren\'s own faces, and especially when Henrietta murmured in her\r\nsleep something about "delightful," "bright leaves and red berries," and\r\nthen, "and \'tis for my own dear papa."\r\n\r\nAnd after all, in the attainment of their fondest wish, were Henrietta\r\nand Frederick as serenely happy as she was?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve, which was also a Saturday, dawned brightly on Henrietta,\r\nbut even her eagerness for her new employment could not so far overcome\r\nher habitual dilatoriness as not to annoy her cousin, Busy Bee, even to\r\na degree of very unnecessary fidgeting when there was any work in hand.\r\nShe sat on thorns all breakfast time, devoured what her grandpapa called\r\na sparrow\'s allowance, swallowed her tea scalding, and thereby gained\r\nnothing but leisure to fret at the deliberation with which Henrietta cut\r\nher bread into little square dice, and spread her butter on them as if\r\neach piece was to serve as a model for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe subject of conversation was not precisely calculated to soothe her\r\nspirits. Grandmamma was talking of giving a young party--a New-year\'s\r\nparty on Monday week, the second of January. "It would be pleasant for\r\nthe young people," she thought, "if Mary did not think it would be too\r\nmuch for her."\r\n\r\nBeatrice looked despairingly at her aunt, well knowing what her answer\r\nwould be, that it would not be at all too much for her, that she should\r\nbe very glad to see her former neighbours, and that it would be a great\r\ntreat to Henrietta and Fred.\r\n\r\n"We will have the carpet up in the dining-room," added Mrs. Langford,\r\n"and Daniels, the carpenter, shall bring his violin, and we can get up a\r\nnice little set for a dance."\r\n\r\n"O thank you, grandmamma," cried Henrietta eagerly, as Mrs. Langford\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\r\n"Poor innocent, you little know!" murmured Queen Bee to herself.\r\n\r\n"That is right, Henrietta," said Mrs. Langford, "I like to see young\r\npeople like young people, not above a dance now and then,--all in\r\nmoderation."\r\n\r\n"Above dancing," said grandpapa, who, perhaps, took this as a reflection\r\non his pet, Queen Bee, "that is what you call being on the high rope,\r\nisn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nBeatrice, though feeling excessively savage, could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n"Are you on the high rope, Queenie?" asked Fred, who sat next to her:\r\n"do you despise the light fantastic--?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know: I do not mind it much," was all she could bring herself\r\nto say, though she could not venture to be more decidedly ungracious\r\nbefore her father. "Not much in itself," she added, in a lower tone,\r\nas the conversation grew louder, "it is the people, Philip Carey, and\r\nall,--but hush! listen."\r\n\r\nHe did so, and heard Careys, Dittons, Evanses, &c., enumerated, and at\r\neach name Beatrice looked gloomier, but she was not observed, for her\r\nAunt Mary had much to hear about the present state of the families, and\r\nthe stream of conversation flowed away from the fete.\r\n\r\nThe meal was at last concluded, and Beatrice in great haste ordered\r\nFrederick off to Sutton Leigh, with a message to Alex to meet them at\r\nthe Church, and bring as much holly as he could, and his great knife.\r\n"Bring him safe," said she, "for if you fail, and prove a corbie\r\nmessenger, I promise you worse than the sharpest sting of the most angry\r\nbee."\r\n\r\nAway she ran to fetch her bonnet and shawl, while Henrietta walked up\r\nafter her, saying she would just fetch her mamma\'s writing-case down\r\nfor her, and then get ready directly. On coming down, she could not help\r\nwaiting a moment before advancing to the table, to hear what was passing\r\nbetween her mother and uncle.\r\n\r\n"Do you like for me to drive you down to the Church to-day?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she answered, raising her mild blue eyes, "I think not."\r\n\r\n"Remember, it will be perfectly convenient, and do just what suits you,"\r\nsaid he in a voice of kind solicitude.\r\n\r\n"Thank you very much, Geoffrey," she replied, in an earnest tone, "but\r\nindeed I had better go for the first time to the service, especially on\r\nsuch a day as to-morrow, when thoughts must be in better order."\r\n\r\n"I understand," said Uncle Geoffrey: and Henrietta, putting down the\r\nwriting-case, retreated with downcast eyes, with a moment\'s perception\r\nof the higher tone of mind to which he had tried to raise her.\r\n\r\nIn the hall she found Mrs. Langford engaged in moving her precious\r\nfamily of plants from their night quarters near the fire to the\r\nbright sunshine near the window. Henrietta seeing her lifting heavy\r\nflower-pots, instantly sprang forward with, "O grandmamma, let me help."\r\n\r\nLittle as Mrs. Langford was wont to allow herself to be assisted, she\r\nwas gratified with the obliging offer, and Henrietta had carried\r\nthe myrtle, the old-fashioned oak-leaved geranium, with its fragrant\r\ndeeply-indented leaves, a grim-looking cactus, and two or three more,\r\nand was deep in the story of the orange-tree, the pip of which had been\r\nplanted by Uncle Geoffrey at five years old, but which never seemed\r\nlikely to grow beyond the size of a tolerable currant-bush, when\r\nBeatrice came down and beheld her with consternation--"Henrietta!\r\nHenrietta! what are you about?" cried she, breaking full into the story.\r\n"Do make haste."\r\n\r\n"I will come in a minute," said Henrietta, who was assisting in\r\nadjusting the prop to which the old daphne was tied.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stop for me, my dear," said Mrs. Langford: "there, don\'t let me\r\nbe in your way."\r\n\r\n"O, grandmamma, I like to do this very much."\r\n\r\n"But, Henrietta," persisted the despotic Queen Bee, "we really ought to\r\nbe there."\r\n\r\n"What is all this about?" said grandmamma, not particularly well\r\npleased. "There, go, go, my dear; I don\'t want any more, thank you: what\r\nare you in such a fuss for now, going out all day again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, grandmamma," said Beatrice, "did you not hear that Mr. Franklin\r\nasked us to dress the church for to-morrow? and we must not waste time\r\nin these short days."\r\n\r\n"Dress the church! Well, I suppose you must have your own way, but I\r\nnever heard of such things in my younger days. Young ladies are very\r\ndifferent now!"\r\n\r\nBeatrice drove Henrietta up-stairs with a renewed "Do make haste," and\r\nthen replied in a tone of argument and irritation, "I do not see why\r\nyoung ladies should not like dressing churches for festivals better than\r\narraying themselves for balls and dances!"\r\n\r\nTrue as the speech was, how would Beatrice have liked to have seen her\r\nfather or mother stand before her at that moment?\r\n\r\n"Ah, well! it is all very well," said grandmamma, shaking her head, as\r\nshe always did when out-argued by Beatrice, "you girls think yourselves\r\nso clever, there is no talking to you; but I think you had much better\r\nlet old Martha alone; she has done it well enough before ever you were\r\nborn, and such a litter as you will make the Church won\'t be fit to be\r\nseen to-morrow! All day in that cold damp place too! I wonder Mary could\r\nconsent, Henrietta looks very delicate."\r\n\r\n"O no, grandmamma, she is quite strong, very strong indeed."\r\n\r\n"I am sure she is hoarse this morning," proceeded Mrs. Langford; "I\r\nshall speak to her mamma."\r\n\r\n"O don\'t, pray, grandmamma; she would be so disappointed. And what would\r\nMr. Franklin do?"\r\n\r\n"O very well, I promise you, as he has done before," said Mrs. Langford,\r\nhastening off to the drawing-room, while her granddaughter darted\r\nupstairs to hurry Henrietta out of the house before a prohibition could\r\narrive. It was what Henrietta had too often assisted Fred in doing to\r\nhave many scruples, besides which she knew how grieved her mamma would\r\nbe to be obliged to stop her, and how glad to find her safe out of\r\nreach; so she let her cousin heap on shawls, fur cuffs, and boas in a\r\nfar less leisurely and discriminating manner than was usual with her.\r\n\r\n"It would be absolute sneaking (to use an elegant word), I suppose,"\r\nsaid Beatrice, "to go down the back stairs."\r\n\r\n"True," said Henrietta, "we will even take the bull by the horns."\r\n\r\n"And trust to our heels," said Beatrice, stealthily opening the door;\r\n"the coast is clear, and I know both your mamma and my papa will not\r\nstop us if they can help it. One, two, three, and away!"\r\n\r\nOff they flew, down the stairs, across the hall, and up the long green\r\nwalk, before they ventured to stop for Henrietta to put on her gloves,\r\nand take up the boa that was dragging behind her like a huge serpent.\r\nAnd after all, there was no need for their flight; they might have\r\ngone openly and with clear consciences, had they but properly and\r\nsubmissively waited the decision of their elders. Mr. Geoffrey Langford,\r\nwho did not know how ill his daughter had been behaving, would have been\r\nvery sorry to interfere with the plan, and easily reconciled his mother\r\nto it, in his own cheerful pleasant way. Indeed her opposition had\r\nbeen entirely caused by Beatrice herself; she had not once thought of\r\nobjecting when it had been first mentioned the evening before, and\r\nhad not Beatrice not first fidgeted and then argued, would only have\r\nregarded it as a pleasant way of occupying their morning.\r\n\r\n"I could scold you, Miss Drone," said Beatrice when the two girls had\r\nset themselves to rights, and recovered breath; "it was all the fault of\r\nyour dawdling."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps it was," said Henrietta, "but you know I could not see\r\ngrandmamma lifting those flower-pots without offering to help her."\r\n\r\n"How many more times shall I have to tell you that grandmamma hates to\r\nbe helped?"\r\n\r\n"Then she was very kind to me," replied Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"I see how it will be," said Beatrice, smiling, "you will be\r\ngrandmamma\'s pet, and it will be a just division. I never yet could get\r\nher to let me help her in anything, she is so resolutely independent."\r\n\r\nQueen Bee did not take into account how often her service was either\r\ngrudgingly offered, or else when she came with a good will, it was also\r\nwith a way, it might be better, it might be worse, but in which she was\r\ndetermined to have the thing done, and against which her grandmamma was\r\nof course equally resolute.\r\n\r\n"She is an amazing person!" said Henrietta. "Is she eighty yet?"\r\n\r\n"Seventy-nine," said Beatrice; "and grandpapa eighty-two. I always say\r\nI think we should get the prize in a show of grandfathers and\r\ngrandmothers, if there was one like Uncle Roger\'s fat cattle shows. You\r\nknow she thinks nothing of walking twice to church on a Sunday, and\r\nall over the village besides when there is anybody ill. But here is the\r\nSutton Leigh path. Let me see if those boys are to be trusted. Yes, yes,\r\nthat\'s right! Capital!" cried she in high glee; "here is Birnam wood\r\ncoming across the field." And springing on one of the bars of the gate\r\nnear the top, she flourished her handkerchief, chanting or singing,\r\n\r\n\r\n"Greet thee well, thou holly green, Welcome, welcome, art thou seen,\r\nWith all thy glittering garlands bending, As to greet my--quick\r\ndescending:"\r\n\r\n\r\nshe finished in an altered tone, as she was obliged to spring\r\nprecipitately down to avoid a fall. "It made a capital conclusion,\r\nhowever, though not quite what I had proposed. Well, gentlemen," as\r\nfour or five of the boys came up, each bearing a huge holly bush--"Well,\r\ngentlemen, you are a sight for sair een."\r\n\r\n"With sair fingers, you mean," said Fred; "these bushes scratch like\r\nhalf a dozen wild cats."\r\n\r\n"It is in too good a cause for me to pity you," said Beatrice.\r\n\r\n"Nor would I accept it if you would," said Fred.\r\n\r\nHis sister, however, seemed determined on bestowing it whether he would\r\nor not,--"How your hands are bleeding! Have you any thorns in them? Let\r\nme see, I have my penknife."\r\n\r\n"Stuff!" was Fred\'s gracious reply, as he glanced at Alex and Carey.\r\n\r\n"But why did you not put on your gloves?" proceeded Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Gloves, nonsense!" said Fred, who never went without them at Rocksand.\r\n\r\n"He will take up the gauntlet presently," said Beatrice. "By the by,\r\nAlex, how many pairs of gloves have you had or lost in your life?"\r\n\r\n"O, I always keep a pair for Sundays and for Allonfield," said Alex.\r\n\r\n"Jessie says she will never let me drive her again without them," said\r\nCarey, "but trust me for that: I hate them, they are such girl\'s things;\r\nI tell her then she can\'t be driven."\r\n\r\nFred could not bear to hear of Carey\'s driving, a thing which he had not\r\nyet been permitted to attempt, and he hastily broke in, "You have not\r\ntold the news yet."\r\n\r\n"What news?"\r\n\r\n"The Euphrosyne is coming home," cried the boys with one voice. "Had we\r\nnot told you? The Euphrosyne is coming home, and Roger may be here any\r\nday!"\r\n\r\n"That is something like news," said Queen Bee; "I thought it would\r\nonly be that the puppies could see, or that Tom\'s tooth was through.\r\nGrandpapa has not heard it?"\r\n\r\n"Papa is going up to tell him," said John. "I was going too, only Alex\r\nbagged me to carry his holly-bush."\r\n\r\n"And so the great Rogero is coming home!" said Beatrice. "How you will\r\nlearn to talk sea slang! And how happy grandmamma will be, especially\r\nif he comes in time for her great affair. Do you hear, Alex? you must\r\npractise your steps, for grandmamma is going to give a grand party,\r\nCareys and Evanses, and all, on purpose to gratify Fred\'s great love of\r\ndancing."\r\n\r\n"I love dancing?" exclaimed Fred, in a tone of astonishment and\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n"Why, did you not look quite enraptured at breakfast when it was\r\nproposed? I expected you every moment to ask the honour of my hand for\r\nthe first quadrille, but I suppose you leave it for Philip Carey!"\r\n\r\n"If it comes at all you must start me, Bee," said Alex, "for I am sure I\r\ncan\'t dance with any one but you."\r\n\r\n"Let me request it now," said Fred, "though why you should think I like\r\ndancing I cannot imagine! I am sure nothing but your Majesty can make it\r\nendurable."\r\n\r\n"There are compliments to your Majesty," cried Henrietta, laughing; "one\r\nwill not or cannot dance at all without her, the other cannot find it\r\nendurable! I long to see which is to be gratified."\r\n\r\n"Time will show," said Beatrice; "I shall ponder on their requests,\r\nand decide maturely, Greek against Prussian, lover of the dance against\r\nhater of the dance."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t love it, I declare," exclaimed Fred.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind it, if you dance with me," said Alex.\r\n\r\nAnd Beatrice was in her glory, teasing them both, and feeling herself\r\nthe object of attention to both.\r\n\r\nFlirtation is not a pleasant word, and it is one which we are apt to\r\nthink applies chiefly to the manners of girls, vain of their personal\r\nappearance, and wanting in sense or education. Beatrice would have\r\nthought herself infinitely above it; but what else was her love of\r\nattention, her delight in playing off her two cousins against each\r\nother? Beauty, or the consciousness of beauty, has little to do with it.\r\nHenrietta, if ever the matter occurred to her, could not help knowing\r\nthat she was uncommonly pretty, yet no one could be more free from any\r\ntendency to this habit. Beatrice knew equally well that she was plain,\r\nbut that did not make the least difference; if any, it was rather on the\r\nside of vanity, in being able without a handsome face, so to attract and\r\nengross her cousins. It was amusing, gratifying, flattering, to feel\r\nher power to play them off, and irritate the little feelings of jealousy\r\nwhich she had detected; and thoughtless as to the right or wrong, she\r\npursued her course.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the church they found that, as was usual with her, she had\r\nbrought them before any one was ready; the doors were locked, and they\r\nhad to wait while Carey and John went to old Martha\'s to fetch the key.\r\nIn a few minutes more Mr. Franklin arrived, well pleased to see them\r\nready to fulfil their promise; the west door was opened, and disclosed a\r\nhuge heap of holly laid up under the tower, ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the boys did was to go up into the belfry, and out on\r\nthe top of the tower, and Busy Bee had a great mind to follow them; but\r\nshe thought it would not be fair to Mr. Franklin, and the wide field\r\nupon which she had to work began to alarm her imagination.\r\n\r\nBefore the boys came down again, she had settled the plan of operations\r\nwith Henrietta and Mr. Franklin, dragged her holly bushes into the\r\naisle, and brought out her knife and string. They came down declaring\r\nthat they could be of no use, and they should go away, and Beatrice made\r\nno objection to the departure of Carey and Johnny, who, as she justly\r\nobserved, would be only in the way; but she insisted on keeping Fred and\r\nAlex.\r\n\r\n"Look at all those pillars! How are we ever to twine them by ourselves?\r\nLook at all those great bushes! How are we to lift them? No, no, indeed,\r\nwe cannot spare you, Fred. We must have some stronger hands to help us,\r\nand you have such a good eye for this sort of thing."\r\n\r\nHad Alexander gone, Fred would have found some excuse for following him,\r\nrather than he should leave him with young ladies, doing young ladies\'\r\nwork; but, as Beatrice well knew, Alex would never withdraw his\r\nassistance when she asked Fred\'s, and she felt secure of them both.\r\n\r\n"There, Alex, settle that ladder by the screen, please. Now will you see\r\nif there is anything to tie a piece of string to? for it is of no use to\r\nmake a festoon if we cannot fasten it."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see anything."\r\n\r\n"Here, give me your hand, and I\'ll look." Up tripped the little Bee,\r\njust holding by his hand. "Yes, to be sure there is! Here is a great\r\nrough nail sticking out. Is it firm? Yes, capitally. Now, Alex, make a\r\nsailor\'s knot round it. Help me down first though--thank you. Fred, will\r\nyou trim that branch into something like shape. You see how I mean. We\r\nmust have a long drooping wreath of holly and ivy, to blend with the\r\nscreen. How tough this ivy is! Thank you--that\'s it. Well, Mr. Franklin,\r\nI hope we shall get on in time."\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin was sure of it; and seeing all actively employed, and\r\nhimself of little use, he took his leave for the present, hoping that\r\nthe Misses Langford would not tire themselves.\r\n\r\nAngels\' work is Church decoration--work fit for angels, that is to say;\r\nbut how pure should be the hands and hearts engaged in it! Its greatness\r\nmakes it solemn and awful. It is work immediately for the glory of\r\nGod; it is work like that of the children who strewed the palm-branches\r\nbefore the steps of the Redeemer! Who can frame in imagination a\r\nmore favoured and delightful occupation, than that of the four young\r\ncreatures who were, in very deed, greeting the coming of their Lord with\r\nthose bright and glistening wreaths with which they were adorning His\r\nsanctuary?\r\n\r\nAngels\' work! but the angels veil their faces and tremble; and we\r\nupon earth have still greater cause to tremble and bow down in awful\r\nreverence, when we are allowed to approach so near His shrine. And was\r\nthat spirit of holy fear--that sole desire for His glory--the chief\r\nthought with these young people?\r\n\r\nNot that there was what even a severe judge could call irreverence in\r\nword or deed; there was no idle laughter, and the conversation was in a\r\ntone and a style which showed that they were all well trained in respect\r\nfor the sanctity of the place. Even in all the helping up and down\r\nladders and steps, in the reaching over for branches, in all the little\r\nmishaps and adventures that befell them, their behaviour was outwardly\r\nperfectly what it ought to have been; and that is no small praise for\r\nfour young people, under seventeen, left in church alone together for so\r\nmany hours.\r\n\r\nBut still Beatrice\'s great aim was, unconsciously perhaps, to keep the\r\ntwo boys entirely devoted to herself, and to exert her power. Wonderful\r\npower it was in reality, which kept them interested in employment\r\nso little accordant with their nature; kept them amused without\r\nirreverence, and doing good service all the time. But it was a power of\r\nwhich she greatly enjoyed the exercise, and which did nothing to lessen\r\nthe rivalry between them. As to Henrietta, she was sitting apart on a\r\nhassock, very happy, and very busy in arranging the Monogram and wreath\r\nwhich she had yesterday proposed. She was almost forgotten by the other\r\nthree--certainly neglected--but she did not feel it so; she had rather\r\nbe quiet, for she could not work and talk like Queen Bee; and she liked\r\nto think over the numerous verses and hymns that her employment brought\r\nto her mind. Uncle Geoffrey\'s conversation dwelt upon her too; she began\r\nto realize his meaning, and she was especially anxious to fulfil his\r\ndesire, by entreating Fred to beware of temptations to disobedience.\r\nOpportunities for private interviews were, however, very rare at Knight\r\nSutton, and she had been looking forward to having him all to herself\r\nhere, when he must wish to visit his father\'s grave with her. She was\r\nvexed for a moment that his first attention was not given to it; but she\r\nknew that his first thought was there, and boys never showed what was\r\nuppermost in their minds to anyone but their sisters. She should have\r\nhim by and by, and the present was full of tranquil enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIf Henrietta had been free from blame in coming to Knight Sutton at all,\r\nor in her way of leaving the house this morning, there would have been\r\nlittle or no drawback to our pleasure in contemplating her.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible!" exclaimed Queen Bee, as the last reverberation of\r\nthe single stroke of the deep-toned clock fell quivering on her ear. "I\r\nthought you would have given us at least eleven more."\r\n\r\n"What a quantity remains to be done!" sighed Henrietta, laying down\r\nthe wreath which she had just completed. "Your work looks beautiful,\r\nQueenie, but how shall we ever finish?"\r\n\r\n"A short winter\'s day, too!" said Beatrice. "One thing is certain--that\r\nwe can\'t go home to luncheon."\r\n\r\n"What will grandmamma think of that?" said Henrietta doubtfully. "Will\r\nshe like it?"\r\n\r\nBeatrice could have answered, "Not at all;" but she said, "O never mind,\r\nit can\'t be helped; we should be late even if we were to set off now,\r\nand besides we might be caught and stopped."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that would be worse than anything," said Henrietta, quite\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\n"So you mean to starve," said Alex.\r\n\r\n"See what slaves men are to creature comforts," said Beatrice; "what do\r\nyou say, Henrietta?"\r\n\r\n"I had much rather stay here," said Henrietta; "I want nothing."\r\n\r\n"Much better fun to go without," said Fred, who had not often enough\r\nmissed a regular meal not to think doing so an honour and a joke.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what will do best of all!" cried Queen Bee. "You go to\r\nDame Reid\'s, and buy us sixpennyworth of the gingerbread papa calls\r\nthe extreme of luxury, and we will eat it on the old men\'s bench in the\r\nporch."\r\n\r\n"Oho! her Majesty is descending to creature comforts," said Alex. "I\r\nthought she would soon come down to other mortals."\r\n\r\n"Only to gratify her famishing subjects," said Beatrice, "you disloyal\r\nvassal, you! Fred is worth a dozen of you. Come, make haste. She is\r\nsure to have a fresh stock, for she always has a great baking when Mr.\r\nGeoffrey is coming."\r\n\r\n"For his private eating?" said Fred.\r\n\r\n"He likes it pretty well, certainly; and he seldom goes through the\r\nvillage without making considerable purchase for the benefit of the\r\nchildren in his path, who take care to be not a few. I found little\r\nJenny Woods made small distinction between Mr. Geoffrey and Mr. Ginger.\r\nBut come, Alex, why are you not off?"\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t happen to have a sixpence," said Alex, with an honest\r\nopenness, overcoming his desire to add "in my pocket." It cost him\r\nan effort; for at school, where each slight advantage was noted,\r\nand comparisons perpetually made, Fred\'s superior wealth and larger\r\nallowance had secured him the adherence of some; and though he either\r\nknew it not, or despised such mammon worship, his rival was sufficiently\r\nawake to it to be uncomfortable in acknowledging his poverty.\r\n\r\n"Every one is poor at the end of the half," said Fred, tossing up his\r\npurse and catching it again, so as to demonstrate its lightness. "Here\r\nis a sixpence, though, at her Majesty\'s service."\r\n\r\n"And do you think she would take your last sixpence, you honour to\r\nloyalty?" said Beatrice, feeling in her pocket. "We are not fallen quite\r\nso low. But alas! the royal exchequer is, as I now remember, locked up\r\nin my desk at home."\r\n\r\n"And my purse is in my workbox," said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"So, Fred, I must be beholden to you for the present," said Beatrice,\r\n"if it won\'t quite break you down."\r\n\r\n"There are more where that came from," said Fred, with a careless air.\r\n"Come along, Alex."\r\n\r\nAway they went. "That is unlucky," soliloquised Queen Bee: "if I could\r\nhave sent Alex alone, it would have been all right, and he would have\r\ncome back again; but now one will carry away the other, and we shall see\r\nthem no more."\r\n\r\n"No, no, that would be rather too bad," said Henrietta. "I am sure Fred\r\nwill behave better."\r\n\r\n"Mark what I say," said Beatrice. "I know how it will be; a dog or a gun\r\nis what a boy cannot for a moment withstand, and if we see them again\r\n\'twill be a nine days\' wonder. But come, we must to the work; I want to\r\nlook at your wreath."\r\n\r\nShe did not, however, work quite as cheerily as before, and lost much\r\ntime in running backwards and forwards to peep out at the door, and\r\nin protesting that she was neither surprised nor annoyed at the\r\nfaithlessness of her envoys. At last a droll little frightened knock was\r\nheard at the door. Beatrice went to open it, and a whitey-brown paper\r\nparcel was held out to her by a boy in a green canvas round frock, and\r\na pair of round, hard, red, solid-looking cheeks; no other than Dame\r\nReid\'s grandson.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said she. "Did Master Alexander give you this?"\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, that\'s right!" and away he went.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Queen Bee, holding up the parcel to Henrietta, who came\r\nout to the porch. "Let us look. O, they have vouchsafed a note!" and\r\nshe took out a crumpled envelope, directed in Aunt Mary\'s handwriting\r\nto Fred, on the back of which Alex had written, "Dear B., we beg pardon,\r\nbut Carey and Dick are going up to Andrews\'s about his terrier.--A. L."\r\n"Very cool, certainly!" said Beatrice, laughing, but still with a little\r\npique. "What a life I will lead them!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you were a true prophet," said Henrietta, "and after all it does\r\nnot much signify. They have done all the work that is out of reach; but\r\nstill I thought Fred would have behaved better."\r\n\r\n"You have yet to learn the difference between Fred with you or with me,\r\nand Fred with his own congeners," said Beatrice; "you don\'t know half\r\nthe phases of boy nature."\r\n\r\nHenrietta sighed; for Fred had certainly not been quite what she\r\nexpected him to-day. Not because he had appeared to forget her, for that\r\nwas nothing--that was only appearance, and her love was too healthy and\r\ntrue even to feel it neglect; but he had forgotten his father\'s grave.\r\nHe was now neglecting the church; and far from its consoling her to hear\r\nthat it was the way with all boys when they came together, it gave her\r\none moment\'s doubt whether they were not happier, when they were all in\r\nall to each other at Rocksand.\r\n\r\nIt was but for one instant that she felt this impression; the next it\r\nhad passed away, and she was sharing the gingerbread with her cousin,\r\nand smiling at the great admiration in which it seemed to be held by\r\nthe natives of Knight Sutton. They took a short walk up and down the\r\nchurchyard while eating it, and then returned to their occupation, well\r\npleased, on re-entering, to see how much show they had made already.\r\nThey worked together very happily; indeed, now that all thought of her\r\nsquires was quite out of her head, Beatrice worked much more in earnest\r\nand in the right kind of frame; something more of the true spirit of\r\nthis service came over her, and she really possessed some of that temper\r\nof devotion which she fancied had been with her the whole day.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful thing when Henrietta raised her face, as she was\r\nkneeling by the font, and her clear sweet voice began at first in a low,\r\ntimid note, but gradually growing fuller and stronger--\r\n\r\n\r\n"Hark! the herald angels sing Glory to the new-born King, Peace on\r\nearth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled."\r\n\r\n\r\nBeatrice took up the strain at the first line, and sweetly did their\r\ntones echo through the building; while their hearts swelled with delight\r\nand thankfulness for the "good tidings of great joy." Another and\r\nanother Christmas hymn was raised, and never were carols sung by happier\r\nvoices; and the decorations proceeded all the better and more suitably\r\nbeneath their influence. They scarcely knew how time passed away, till\r\nHenrietta, turning round, was amazed to see Uncle Geoffrey standing just\r\nwithin the door watching them.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful!" said he, as she suddenly ceased, in some confusion; "your\r\nwork is beautiful! I came here prepared to scold you a little, but I\r\ndon\'t think I can. Who made that wreath and Monogram?"\r\n\r\n"She did, of course, papa," said Beatrice, pointing to her cousin. "Who\r\nelse could?"\r\n\r\n"It is a very successful arrangement," said Uncle Geoffrey, moving about\r\nto find the spot for obtaining the best view. "It is an arrangement to\r\nsuggest so much."\r\n\r\nHenrietta came to the place where he stood, and for the first time\r\nperceived the full effect of her work. It was placed in front of the\r\naltar, the dark crimson covering of which relieved the shining leaves\r\nand scarlet berries of the holly. The three letters, I H S, were in\r\nthe centre, formed of small sprays fastened in the required shape; and\r\naround them was a large circle of holly, plaited and twined together,\r\nthe many-pointed leaves standing out in every direction in their\r\npeculiar stiff gracefulness.\r\n\r\n"I see it now!" said she, in a low voice full of awe. "Uncle, I did not\r\nmean to make it so!"\r\n\r\n"How?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It is like Good Friday!" said she, as the resemblance to the crown of\r\nthorns struck her more and more strongly.\r\n\r\n"Well, why not, my dear?" said her uncle, as she shrunk closer to him in\r\na sort of alarm. "Would Christmas be worth observing if it were not for\r\nGood Friday?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is right uncle; but somehow it is melancholy."\r\n\r\n"Where are those verses that say--let me see--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'And still Thy Church\'s faith Shall link,\r\n     In all her prayer and praise,\r\n     Thy glory with Thy death.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you see, Henrietta, you have been guided to do quite right."\r\n\r\nHenrietta gave a little sigh, but did not answer: and Beatrice said,\r\n"It is a very odd thing, whenever any work of art--or, what shall I call\r\nit?--is well done, it is apt to have so much more in it than the author\r\nintended. It is so in poetry, painting, and everything else."\r\n\r\n"There is, perhaps, more meaning than we understand, when we talk of the\r\nspirit in which a thing is done," said her father: "But have you much\r\nmore to do? Those columns look very well."\r\n\r\n"O, are you come to help us, papa?"\r\n\r\n"I came chiefly because grandmamma was a good deal concerned at your\r\nnot coming home to luncheon. You must not be out the whole morning again\r\njust at present. I have some sandwiches in my pocket for you."\r\n\r\nBeatrice explained how they had been fed, and her papa said, "Very well,\r\nwe will find some one who will be glad of them; but mind, do not make\r\nher think you unsociable again. Do you hear and heed?"\r\n\r\nIt was the sort of tone which, while perfectly kind and gentle, shows\r\nthat it belongs to a man who will be obeyed, and ready compliance was\r\npromised. He proceeded to give his very valuable aid at once in taste\r\nand execution, the adornment prospered greatly, and when Mr. Franklin\r\ncame in, his surprise and delight were excited by the beauty which\r\nhad grown up in his absence. The long, drooping, massive wreaths of\r\nevergreen at the east end, centring in the crown and letters; the spiral\r\nfestoons round the pillars; the sprays in every niche; the tower of\r\nholly over the font--all were more beautiful, both together and singly,\r\nthan he had even imagined, and he was profuse in admiration and thanks.\r\n\r\nThe work was done; and the two Misses Langford, after one well-satisfied\r\nsurvey from the door, bent their steps homeward, looking forward to the\r\npleasure with which grandpapa and Aunt Mary would see it to-morrow. As\r\nthey went in the deepening twilight, the whole village seemed vocal:\r\nchildren\'s voices, shrill and tuneless near, but softened by distance,\r\nwere ringing out here, there, and everywhere, with\r\n\r\n\r\n"As shepherds watch\'d their flocks by night."\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again, as they walked on, the sound from another band of little\r\nvoices was brought on the still frosty wind--\r\n\r\n\r\n"Glad tidings of great joy I bring To you and all mankind."\r\n\r\nImperfect rhymes, bad voices, no time observed; but how joyous,--how\r\nreally Christmas-like--how well it suited the soft half-light, the last\r\npale shine of sunset lingering in the south-west! the large solemn stars\r\nthat one by one appeared! How Uncle Geoffrey caught up the lines and\r\nsang them over to himself! How light and free Beatrice walked!--and how\r\nthe quiet happy tears would rise in Henrietta\'s eyes!\r\n\r\nThe singing in the drawing-room that evening, far superior as it was,\r\nwith Henrietta, Beatrice, Frederick, and even Aunt Mary\'s beautiful\r\nvoice, was not equal in enjoyment to that. Was it because Beatrice was\r\nteasing Fred all the time about his defection? The church singers came\r\nup to the Hall, and the drawing-room door was set open for the party\r\nto listen to them; grandpapa and Uncle Geoffrey went out to have a talk\r\nwith them, and so passed the space till tea-time; to say nothing of the\r\nmany little troops of young small voices outside the windows, to whom\r\nMrs. Langford\'s plum buns, and Mr. Geoffrey\'s sixpences, were a very\r\nenjoyable part of the Christmas festivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe double feast of Sunday and Christmas-day dawned upon Henrietta with\r\nmany anxieties for her mother, to whom the first going to church must\r\nbe so great a trial. Would that she could, as of old, be at her side the\r\nwhole day! but this privilege, unrecked of at Rocksand, was no longer\r\nhers. She had to walk to church with grandmamma and the rest of the\r\nparty, while Mrs. Frederick Langford was driven in the open carriage\r\nby old Mr. Langford, and she was obliged to comfort herself with\r\nrecollecting that no companion ever suited her better than grandpapa. It\r\nwas a sight to be remembered when she came into church, leaning upon his\r\narm, her sweet expression of peace and resignation, making her even more\r\nlovely than when last she entered there--her face in all its early bloom\r\nof youthful beauty, and radiant with innocent happiness.\r\n\r\nBut Henrietta knew not how to appreciate that "peace which passeth all\r\nunderstanding;" and all that she saw was the glistening of tears in her\r\neyes, and the heaving of her bosom, as she knelt down in her place; and\r\nshe thought that if she had calculated all that she would have to go\r\nthrough, and all her own anxieties for her, she should never have urged\r\ntheir removal. She viewed it, however, as a matter of expediency rather\r\nthan of duty, and her feelings were not in the only right and wholesome\r\nchannel. As on the former occasion, Knight Sutton Church seemed to her\r\nmore full of her father\'s presence than of any other, so now, throughout\r\nthe service, she was chiefly occupied with watching her mother; and\r\nentirely by the force of her own imagination, she contrived to work\r\nherself into a state of nervous apprehension, only equalled by her\r\nmamma\'s own anxieties for Fred.\r\n\r\nNeither she nor any of her young cousins were yet confirmed, so they all\r\nleft the church together. What would she not have given to be able to\r\ntalk her fears over with either Frederick or Beatrice, and be assured\r\nby them that her mamma had borne it very well, and would not suffer from\r\nit. But though neither of them was indifferent or unfeeling, there was\r\nnot much likelihood of sympathy from them just at present. Beatrice had\r\nalways been sure that Aunt Mary would behave like an angel; and when\r\nFred saw that his mother looked tranquil, and showed no symptoms of\r\nagitation, he dismissed anxiety from his mind, and never even guessed at\r\nhis sister\'s alarms.\r\n\r\nNor in reality had he many thoughts for his sister of any kind; for he\r\nwas, as usual, engrossed with Queen Bee, criticising the decorations\r\nwhich had been completed in his absence, and, together with Alex,\r\nreplying to the scolding with which she visited their desertion.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more eminently successful than the decorations,\r\nwhich looked to still greater advantage in the brightness of the morning\r\nsun than in the dimness of the evening twilight; and many were the\r\ncompliments which the two young ladies received upon their handiwork.\r\nThe old women had "never seen nothing like it,"--the school children\r\nwhispered to each other, "How pretty!" Uncle Geoffrey and Mr. Franklin\r\nadmired even more than before; grandpapa and Aunt Mary were delighted;\r\ngrandmamma herself allowed it was much better than she had expected; and\r\nJessie Carey, by way of climax, said it "was like magic."\r\n\r\nIt was a very different Sunday from those to which Henrietta had been\r\naccustomed, in the complete quiet and retirement of Rocksand. The Hall\r\nwas so far from the church, that there was but just time to get back in\r\ntime for evening service. After which, according to a practice of which\r\nshe had often heard her mamma speak with many agreeable reminiscences,\r\nthe Langford family almost always went in a body on a progress to the\r\nfarmyard, to visit the fatting oxen and see the cows milked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Roger Langford was at home with little Tom, and Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford was glad to seek the tranquillity and repose of her own\r\napartment; but all the rest went in procession, greatly to the amusement\r\nof Fred and Henrietta, to the large barn-like building, where a narrow\r\npath led them along the front of the stalls of the gentle-looking\r\nsweet-breathed cows, and the huge white-horned oxen.\r\n\r\nUncle Roger, as always happened, monopolised his brother, and kept\r\nhim estimating the weight of the great Devon ox, which was next for\r\nexecution. Grandmamma was escorting Charlie and Arthur (whom their\r\ngrandfather was wont to call penultimus and antepenultimus), helping\r\nthem to feed the cows with turnips, and guarding them from going behind\r\ntheir heels. Henrietta was extremely happy, for grandpapa himself was\r\ndoing the honours for her, and instructing her in the difference between\r\na Guernsey cow and a short-horn; and so was Alexander, for he had Queen\r\nBee all to himself in a remote corner of the cow-house, rubbing old\r\nspotted Nancy\'s curly brow, catching at her polished black-tipped horn,\r\nand listening to his hopes and fears for the next half year. Not so\r\nFrederick, as he stood at the door with Jessie Carey, who, having no\r\nlove for the cow-house, especially when in her best silk, thought always\r\nready to take care of the children there, was very glad to secure a\r\ncompanion outside, especially one so handsome, so much more polished\r\nthan any of her cousins, and so well able to reply to her small talk.\r\nLittle did she guess how far off he wished her, or how he longed to be\r\nlistening to his uncles, talking to Beatrice, sticking holly into the\r\ncows\' halters with John and Richard, scrambling into the hay-loft with\r\nCarey and William--anywhere, rather than be liable to the imputation of\r\nbeing too fine a gentleman to enter a cow-house.\r\n\r\nThis accusation never entered the head of any one but himself; but still\r\nan attack was in store for him. After a few words to Martin the cowman,\r\nand paying their respects to the pigs, the party left the farm-yard, and\r\nthe inhabitants of Sutton Leigh took the path to their own abode, while\r\nBeatrice turned round to her cousin, saying, "Well, Fred, I congratulate\r\nyou on your politeness! How well you endured being victimised!"\r\n\r\n"I victimised! How do you know I was not enchanted?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, you can\'t deceive me while you have a transparent face. Trust me\r\nfor finding out whether you are bored or not. Besides, I would not pay\r\nso bad a compliment to your taste as to think otherwise."\r\n\r\n"How do you know I was not exercising the taste of Rubens himself? I\r\nwas actually admiring you all, and thinking how like it all was to that\r\ngreat print from one of his pictures; the building with its dark gloomy\r\nroof, and open sides, the twilight, the solitary dispersed snow-flakes,\r\nthe haze of dust, the sleek cattle, and their long white horns."\r\n\r\n"Quite poetical," said Queen Bee, in a short, dry, satirical manner.\r\n"How charmed Jessie must have been!"\r\n\r\n"Why?" said Fred, rather provoked.\r\n\r\n"Such masterly eyes are not common among our gentlemen. You will be\r\nquite her phoenix; and how much \'Thomson\'s Seasons\' you will have to\r\nhear! I dare say you have had it already--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'Now, shepherds, to your helpless charge be kind!\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"Well, very good advice, too," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"I hate and detest Thomson," said Beatrice; "above all, for travestying\r\nRuth into \'the lovely young Lavinia;\' so whenever Jessie treated me to\r\nany of her quotations, I criticised him without mercy, and at last I\r\nsaid, by great good luck, that the only use of him was to serve as an\r\nimposition for young ladies at second-rate boarding schools. It was a\r\ncapital hit, for Alex found out that it was the way she learnt so much\r\nof him, and since that time I have heard no more of \'Jemmy Thomson!\r\nJemmy Thomson! O!\'"\r\n\r\nThe laughter which followed this speech had a tone in it, which,\r\nreaching Mr. Geoffrey Langford, who was walking a little in front with\r\nhis mother, made him suspect that the young people were getting into\r\nsuch spirits as were not quite Sunday-like; and, turning round, he asked\r\nthem some trifling question, which made him a party to the conversation,\r\nand brought it back to a quieter, though not less merry tone.\r\n\r\nDinner was at five, and Henrietta was dressed so late that Queen Bee had\r\nto come up to summon her, and bring her down after every one was in the\r\ndining-room--an entree all the more formidable, because Mr. Franklin was\r\ndining there, as well as Uncle Roger and Alexander.\r\n\r\nThanks in some degree to her own dawdling, she had been in a hurry the\r\nwhole day, and she longed for a quiet evening: but here it seemed to\r\nher, as with the best intentions it usually is, in a large party, that,\r\nbut for the laying aside of needlework, of secular books and secular\r\nmusic, it might as well have been any other day of the week.\r\n\r\nHer mamma was very tired, and went to bed before tea, the gentlemen had\r\na long talk over the fire, the boys and Beatrice laughed and talked, and\r\nshe helped her grandmamma to hand about the tea, answering her questions\r\nabout her mother\'s health and habits, and heard a good deal that\r\ninterested her, but still she could not feel as if it were Sunday.\r\nAt Rocksand she used to sit for many a pleasant hour, either in the\r\ndarkening summer twilight, or the bright red light of the winter fire,\r\nrepeating or singing hymns, and enjoying the most delightful talks that\r\nthe whole week had to offer, and now she greatly missed the conversation\r\nthat would have "set this strange week to rights in her head," as she\r\nsaid to herself.\r\n\r\nShe thought over it a good deal whilst Bennet was brushing her hair at\r\nnight, feeling as if it had been a week-day, and as if it would be as\r\ndifficult to begin a new fresh week on Monday morning, as it would a\r\nnew day after sitting up a whole night. How far this was occasioned by\r\nKnight Sutton habits, and how far it was her own fault, was not what she\r\nasked herself, though she sat up for a long time musing on the change\r\nin her way of life, and scarcely able to believe that it was only last\r\nSunday that she had been sitting with her mother over their fire at\r\nRocksand. Enough had happened for a whole month. Her darling project was\r\nfulfilled; the airy castle of former days had become a substance, and\r\nshe was inhabiting it: and was she really so very much happier? There\r\nshe went into a reverie--but musing is not meditating, nor vague\r\ndreamings wholesome reflections; she went on sitting their, chiefly\r\nfor want of energy to move, till the fire burnt low, the clock struck\r\ntwelve, and Mrs. Frederick Langford exclaimed in a sleepy voice, "My\r\ndear, are you going to sleep there?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBreakfast was nearly over on Monday morning, when a whole party of the\r\nSutton Leigh boys entered with the intelligence that the great pond in\r\nKnight\'s Portion was quite frozen over, and that skating might begin\r\nwithout loss of time.\r\n\r\n"You are coming, are you not, Bee?" said Alex, leaning over the back of\r\nher chair.\r\n\r\n"O yes," said she, nearly whispering "only take care. It is taboo\r\nthere,"--and she made a sign with her hand towards Mrs. Langford, "and\r\ndon\'t frighten Aunt Mary about Fred. O it is too late, Carey\'s doing the\r\ndeed as fast as he can."\r\n\r\nCarey was asking Fred whether he had ever skated, or could skate, and\r\nFred was giving an account of his exploits in that line at school,\r\nhoping it might prove to his mother that he might be trusted to take\r\ncare of himself since he had dared the danger before. In vain: the\r\nalarmed expression had come over her face, as she asked Alexander\r\nwhether his father had looked at the ice.\r\n\r\n"No," said Alex, "but it is perfectly safe. I tried it this morning, and\r\nit is as firm as this marble chimney-piece."\r\n\r\n"He is pretty well to be trusted," said his grandfather, "more\r\nespecially as it would be difficult to get drowned there."\r\n\r\n"I would give a shilling to anyone who could drown himself there," said\r\nAlex.\r\n\r\n"The travelling man did," exclaimed at once Carey, John, and Richard.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they come in just like the Greek chorus?" said Beatrice, in a\r\nwhisper to Fred, who gave a little laugh, but was too anxious to attend\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n"I thought he was drowned in the river," said Alex.\r\n\r\n"No, it was in the deep pool under the weeping willow, where the\r\nduckweed grows so rank in summer," said Carey.\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey laughed. "I am sorry to interfere with your romantic\r\nembellishments, Carey, or with the credit of your beloved pond, since\r\nyou are determined not to leave it behindhand with its neighbours."\r\n\r\n"I always thought it was there," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"And thought wrong; the poor man was found in the river two miles off."\r\n\r\n"I always heard it was at Knight\'s Pool," repeated Carey.\r\n\r\n"I do not know what you may have heard," said Uncle Geoffrey; "but as it\r\nhappened a good while before you were born, I think you had better not\r\nargue the point."\r\n\r\n"Grandpapa," persisted Carey, "was it not in Knight\'s Pool?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," was the answer drily given.\r\n\r\n"Well," continued Carey, "I am sure you might drown yourself there."\r\n\r\n"Rather than own yourself mistaken," said Uncle Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n"Carey, Carey, I hate contradiction," said grandmamma, rising and\r\nrustling past where he stood with a most absurd, dogged, unconvinced\r\nface. "Take your arm off the mantelpiece, let that china cup alone, and\r\nstand like a gentleman. Do!"\r\n\r\n"All in vain!" said Beatrice. "To the end of his life he will maintain\r\nthat Knight\'s Pool drowned the travelling man!"\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind," said John, impatiently, "are we coming to skate this\r\nmorning or are we not?"\r\n\r\n"I really wish," said Aunt Mary, as if she could not help it, "without\r\ndistrusting either old Knight\'s Pool or your judgment, Alexander, that\r\nyou would ask some one to look at it."\r\n\r\n"I should like just to run down and see the fun," said Uncle Geoffrey,\r\nthus setting all parties at rest for the moment. The two girls ran\r\njoyfully up to put on their bonnets, as Henrietta wished to see,\r\nBeatrice to join in, the sport. At that instant Mrs. Langford asked\r\nher son Geoffrey to remove some obstacle which hindered the comfortable\r\nshutting of the door, and though a servant might just as well have done\r\nit, he readily complied, according to his constant habit of making all\r\nelse give way to her, replying to the discomfited looks of the boys, "I\r\nshall be ready by the time the young ladies come down."\r\n\r\nSo he was, long before Henrietta was ready, and just as she and Beatrice\r\nappeared on the stairs, Atkins was carrying across the hall what the\r\nboys looked at with glances of dismay, namely, the post-bag. Knight\r\nSutton, being small and remote, did not possess a post-office, but\r\na messenger came from Allonfield for the letters on every day except\r\nSunday, and returned again in the space of an hour. A very inconvenient\r\narrangement, as everyone had said for the last twenty years, and might\r\nprobably say for twenty years more.\r\n\r\nAs usual, more than half the contents were for G. Langford, Esq.,\r\nand Fred\'s face grew longer and longer as he saw the closely-written\r\nbusiness-like sheets.\r\n\r\n"Fred, my poor fellow," said his uncle, looking up, "I am sorry for you,\r\nbut one or two must be answered by this day\'s post. I will not be longer\r\nthan I can help."\r\n\r\n"Then do let us come on," exclaimed the chorus.\r\n\r\n"Come, Queenie," added Alex.\r\n\r\nShe delayed, however, saying, "Can I do any good, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, let me see. I do not like to stop you, but it would save\r\ntime if you could just copy a letter."\r\n\r\n"O thank you, pray let me," said Beatrice, delighted. "Go on, Henrietta,\r\nI shall soon come."\r\n\r\nHenrietta would have waited, but she saw a chance of speaking to her\r\nbrother, which she did not like to lose.\r\n\r\nHer mother had taken advantage of the various conversations going on in\r\nthe hall, to draw her son aside, saying, "Freddy, I believe you think me\r\nvery troublesome, but do let me entreat of you not to venture on the ice\r\ntill one of your uncles has said it is safe."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Roger trusts Alex," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he lets all those boys take their chance, and a number of\r\nyou together are likely to be careless, and I know there used to be\r\ndangerous places in that pond. I will not detain you, my dear," added\r\nshe, as the others were preparing to start, "only I beg you will not\r\nattempt to skate till your uncle comes."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Frederick, in a tone of as much annoyance as ever he\r\nshowed his mother, and with little suspicion how much it cost her not\r\nto set her mind at rest by exacting a promise from him. This she had\r\nresolutely forborne to do in cases like the present, from his earliest\r\ndays, and she had her reward in the implicit reliance she could place\r\non his word when once given. And now, sighing that it had not been\r\nvoluntarily offered, she went to her sofa, to struggle and reason in\r\nvain with her fears, and start at each approaching step, lest it should\r\nbring the tidings of some fatal accident, all the time blaming herself\r\nfor the entreaties which might, as she dreaded, place him in peril of\r\ndisobedience.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Mr. Geoffrey Langford was sitting in the great red\r\nleathern chair in the study, writing as fast as his fingers would move,\r\napparently without a moment for thought, though he might have said, like\r\nthe great painter, that what seemed the work of half an hour, was in\r\nfact the labour of years. His daughter, her bonnet by her side, sat\r\nopposite to him, writing with almost equal rapidity, and supremely\r\nhappy, for to the credit of our little Queen Bee let it be spoken, that\r\nno talk with Henrietta, no walk with grandpapa, no new exciting tale,\r\nno, not even a flirtation with Fred and Alex, one or both, was equal in\r\nher estimation to the pleasure and honour of helping papa, even though\r\nit was copying a dry legal opinion, instead of gliding about on the\r\nsmooth hard ice, in the bright winter morning\'s sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe two pens maintained a duet of diligent scratching for some twenty\r\nor five and twenty minutes without intermission, but at last Beatrice\r\nlooked up, and without speaking, held up her sheet.\r\n\r\n"Already? Thank you, my little clerk, I could think it was mamma. Now\r\nthen, off to the skating. My compliments to Fred, and tell him I feel\r\nfor him, and will not keep him waiting longer than I can avoid:" and\r\nmuttering a resumption of his last sentence, on went the lawyer\'s\r\nindefatigable pen; and away flew the merry little Busy Bee, bounding off\r\nwith her droll, tripping, elastic, short-stepped run, which suited so\r\nwell with her little alert figure, and her dress, a small plain black\r\nvelvet bonnet, a tight black velvet "jacket," as she called it, and a\r\nbrown silk dress, with narrow yellow stripes (chosen chiefly in joke,\r\nbecause it was the colour of a bee), not a bit of superfluous shawl,\r\nboa, or ribbon about her, but all close and compact, fit for the\r\ndiversion which she was eager to enjoy. The only girl among so many\r\nboys, she had learnt to share in many of their sports, and one of the\r\nprime favourites was skating, a diversion which owes as much of its\r\ncharm to the caprices of its patron Jack Frost, as to the degree of\r\nskill which it requires.\r\n\r\nShe arrived at the stile leading to "Knight\'s Portion," as it was\r\ncalled, and a very barren portion must the poor Knight have possessed if\r\nit was all his property. It was a sloping chalky field or rather corner\r\nof a down, covered with very short grass and thistles, which defied\r\nall the attacks of Uncle Roger and his sheep. On one side was a sort of\r\nprecipice, where the chalk had been dug away, and a rather extensive old\r\nchalk pit formed a tolerable pond, by the assistance of the ditch at the\r\nfoot of a hedge. On the glassy surface already marked by many a sharply\r\ntraced circular line, the Sutton Leigh boys were careering, the younger\r\nones with those extraordinary bends, twists, and contortions to which\r\nthe unskilful are driven in order to preserve their balance. Frederick\r\nand Henrietta stood on the brink, neither of them looking particularly\r\ncheerful; but both turned gladly at the sight of the Busy Bee, and came\r\nto meet her with eager inquiries for her papa.\r\n\r\nShe was a very welcome sight to both, especially Henrietta, who had from\r\nthe first felt almost out of place alone with all those boys, and\r\nwho hoped that she would be some comfort to poor Fred, who had been\r\nentertaining her with every variety of grumbling for the last half-hour,\r\nand perversely refusing to walk out of sight of the forbidden pleasure,\r\nor to talk of anything else. Such a conversation as she was wishing for\r\nwas impossible whilst he was constantly calling out to the others, and\r\nexclaiming at their adventures, and in the intervals lamenting his\r\nown hard fate, scolding her for her slowness in dressing, which had\r\noccasioned the delay, and magnifying the loss of his pleasure, perhaps\r\nin a sort of secret hope that the temptation would so far increase as\r\nto form in his eyes an excuse for yielding to it. Seldom had he shown\r\nhimself so unamiable towards her, and with great relief and satisfaction\r\nshe beheld her cousin descending the steep slippery path from the height\r\nabove, and while the cloud began to lighten on his brow, she thought to\r\nherself, "It will be all right now, he is always happy with Busy Bee!"\r\n\r\nSo he might have been had Beatrice been sufficiently unselfish for once\r\nto use her influence in the right direction, and surrender an amusement\r\nfor the sake of another; but to give up or defer such a pleasure as\r\nskating with Alex never entered her mind, though a moment\'s reflection\r\nmight have shown her how much more annoying the privation would be\r\nrendered by the sight of a girl fearlessly enjoying the sport from which\r\nhe was debarred. It would, perhaps, be judging too hardly to reckon\r\nagainst her as a fault that her grandmamma could not bear to hear of\r\nanything so "boyish," and had long ago entreated her to be more like a\r\nyoung lady. There was no positive order in this case, and her papa\r\nand mamma did not object. So she eagerly answered Alexander\'s summons,\r\nfastened on her skates, and soon was gliding merrily on the surface of\r\nthe Knight\'s Pool, while her cousins watched her dexterity with surprise\r\nand interest; but soon Fred once more grew gloomy, sighed, groaned,\r\nlooked at his watch, and recommenced his complaints. At first she\r\nhad occupation enough in attending to her own security to bestow any\r\nattention on other things, but in less than a quarter of an hour, she\r\nbegan to feel at her ease, and her spirits rising to the pitch where\r\nconsideration is lost, she "could not help," in her own phrase, laughing\r\nat the disconsolate Fred.\r\n\r\n"How woebegone he looks!" said she, as she whisked past, "but never\r\nmind, Fred, the post must go some time or other."\r\n\r\n"It must be gone," said Fred. "I am sure we have been here above an\r\nhour!"\r\n\r\n"Henrietta looks blue with cold, like an old hen obliged to follow her\r\nducklings to the water!" observed Beatrice, again gliding near, and in\r\nthe midst of her next circular sweep she chanted--\r\n\r\n\r\n"Although their feet are pointed, and my feet are round, Pray, is that\r\nany reason why I should be drowned?"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a great aggravation of Fred\'s calamities to be obliged to laugh,\r\nnor were matters mended by the sight of the party now advancing from the\r\nhouse, Jessie Carey, with three of the lesser boys.\r\n\r\n"What news of Uncle Geoffrey?"\r\n\r\n"I did not see him," said Jessie: "I think he was in the study, Uncle\r\nRoger went to him there."\r\n\r\n"No hope then!" muttered the unfortunate Fred.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you skate, Fred?" asked little Arthur with a certain most\r\nprovoking face of wonder and curiosity.\r\n\r\n"Presently," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"He must not," cried Richard, in a tone which Fred thought malicious,\r\nthough it was only rude.\r\n\r\n"Must not?" and Arthur looked up in amazement to the boy so much taller\r\nthan his three brothers, creatures in his eyes privileged to do what\r\nthey pleased.\r\n\r\n"His mamma won\'t let him," was Dick\'s polite answer. Fred could have\r\nknocked him down with the greatest satisfaction, but in the first place\r\nhe was out of reach, in the second, the young ladies were present, in\r\nthe third he was a little boy, and a stupid one, and Fred had temper\r\nenough left to see that there would be nothing gained by quarrelling\r\nwith him, so contenting himself with a secret but most ardent wish that\r\nhe had him as his fag at school, he turned to Jessie, and asked her what\r\nshe thought of the weather, if the white frost would bring rain, &c.,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nJessie thought the morning too bright not to be doubtful, and the hoar\r\nfrost was so very thick and white that it was not likely to continue\r\nmuch longer.\r\n\r\n"How beautiful these delicate white crests are to every thorn in the\r\nhedge!" said Henrietta; "and look, these pieces of chalk are almost\r\ncased in glass."\r\n\r\n"O I do love such a sight!" said Jessie. "Here is a beautiful bit of\r\nstick crusted over."\r\n\r\n"It is a perfect little Giant\'s Causeway," said Henrietta; "do look at\r\nthese lovely little columns, Fred."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Jessie, "Myriads of little salts, or hook\'d or shaped like\r\ndouble wedges.--"\r\n\r\nShe thought Beatrice safe out of hearing, but that very moment by she\r\ncame, borne swiftly along, and catching the cadence of that one line,\r\nlooked archly at Fred, and shaped with her lips rather than uttered--"O\r\nJemmy Thomson! Jemmy Thomson, O!"\r\n\r\nIt filled up the measure. That Beatrice, Alexander and Chorus should be\r\nmaking him a laughing-stock, and him pinned to Miss Carey\'s side, was\r\nmore than he could endure. He had made up his mind that Uncle Geoffrey\r\nwas not coming at all, his last feeble hold of patience and obedience\r\ngave way, and he exclaimed, "Well, I shan\'t wait any longer, it is not\r\nof the least use."\r\n\r\n"O, Fred, consider!" said his sister.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Freddy," shouted Carey, "he\'ll not come now, I\'ll answer\r\nfor it."\r\n\r\n"You know he promised he would," pleaded Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Roger has got hold of him, and he is as bad as the old man of the\r\nsea," said Fred, "the post has been gone this half-hour, and I shall not\r\nwait any longer."\r\n\r\n"Think of mamma."\r\n\r\n"How can you talk such nonsense, Henrietta?" exclaimed Fred impatiently,\r\n"do you think that I am so awfully heavy that the ice that bears them\r\nmust needs break with me?"\r\n\r\n"I do not suppose there is any danger," said Henrietta, "but for the\r\nsake of poor mamma\'s entreaties!"\r\n\r\n"Do you think I am going to be kept in leading-strings all the rest of\r\nmy life?" said Fred, obliged to work himself into a passion in order to\r\nsilence his sister and his conscience. "I have submitted to such absurd\r\nnonsense a great deal too long already, I will not be made a fool of in\r\nthe sight of everybody; so here goes!"\r\n\r\nAnd breaking away from her detaining arm, he ran down to the verge of\r\nthe pond, and claimed the skates which he had lent to John. Henrietta\r\nturned away her eyes full of tears.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Henrietta," shouted the good-natured Alexander, "I\'ll\r\nengage to fish him out if he goes in."\r\n\r\n"It is as likely I may fish you out, Mr. Alex," returned Fred, slightly\r\naffronted.\r\n\r\n"Or more likely still there will be no fishing in the case," said the\r\nnaughty little Syren, who felt all the time a secret satisfaction in the\r\nconsciousness that it was she who had made the temptation irresistible,\r\nthen adding, to pacify Henrietta and her own feelings of compunction,\r\n"Aunt Mary must be satisfied when she hears with what exemplary patience\r\nhe waited till papa was past hope, and the pond past fear."\r\n\r\nWhether Alex smiled at the words "past fear," or whether Fred only\r\nthought he did, is uncertain, the effect was that he exclaimed, "I only\r\nwish there was a place in this pond that you did not like to skate over,\r\nAlex."\r\n\r\n"Well, there is one," said Alex, laughing, "where Carey drowns the\r\ntravelling man: there is a spring there, and the ice is never so firm,\r\nso you may try--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Fred--I beg you won\'t!" cried Beatrice.\r\n\r\n"O, Fred, Fred, think, think, if anything should happen!" implored\r\nHenrietta.\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t look, I can\'t bear it!" exclaimed Jessie, turning away.\r\n\r\nFred without listening skated triumphantly towards the hedge, and across\r\nthe perilous part, and fortunately it was without disaster. In the\r\nmiddle of the shout of applause with which the chorus celebrated his\r\nachievement, a gate in the hedge suddenly opened, and the two uncles\r\nstood before them. The first thing Uncle Geoffrey did was to take a\r\nshort run, and slide right across the middle of the pond, while Uncle\r\nRoger stood by laughing and saying, "Well done, Geoffrey, you are not\r\nquite so heavy as I am."\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey reaching the opposite side, caught up little Charley by\r\nthe arms and whirled him round in the air, then shouted in a voice\r\nthat had all the glee and blithe exultation of a boy just released\r\nfrom school, "I hereby certify to all whom it may concern, the pond is\r\nfranked! Where\'s Fred?"\r\n\r\nFred wished himself anywhere else, and so did Henrietta. Even Queen\r\nBee\'s complacency gave way before her father, and it was only Alexander\r\nwho had spirit to answer, "We thought you were not coming at all."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Uncle Geoffrey; and little Willy exclaimed, "Why, Alex,\r\nUncle Geoffrey always comes when he promises," a truth to which every\r\none gave a mental assent.\r\n\r\nWithout taking the smallest notice of Frederick by word or look, Uncle\r\nGeoffrey proceeded to join the other boys, to the great increase of\r\ntheir merriment, instructing them in making figures of eight, and in all\r\nthe other mysteries of the skating art, which they could scarcely enjoy\r\nmore than he seemed to do. Henrietta, cold and unhappy, grieved at her\r\nbrother\'s conduct, and still more grieved at the displeasure of her\r\nuncle, wished to return to the house, yet could not make up her mind\r\nto do so, for fear of her mamma\'s asking about Fred; and whilst she was\r\nstill doubting and hesitating, the Church bell began to ring, reminding\r\nher of the saint\'s day service, one of the delights of Knight Sutton\r\nto which she had so long looked forward. Yet here was another\r\ndisappointment. The uncles and the two girls immediately prepared to go.\r\nJessie said she must take Arthur and Charley home, and set off. The boys\r\ncould do as they pleased, and Willy holding Uncle Geoffrey\'s hand was\r\ngoing with him, but the rest continued their sport, and among them was\r\nFred. He had never disobeyed a Church bell before, and had rather not\r\nhave done so now, but as he saw none of his male companions setting off,\r\nhe fancied that to attend a week-day service in the holidays might be\r\nreckoned a girlish proceeding, imagined his cousins laughing at him as\r\nsoon as his back was turned, and guessed from Uncle Geoffrey\'s grave\r\nlooks that he might be taken to task when no longer protected by the\r\npresence of the rest.\r\n\r\nHe therefore replied with a gruff short "No" to his sister\'s anxious\r\nquestion whether he was not coming, and flourished away to the other end\r\nof the pond; but a few seconds after he was not a little surprised and\r\nvexed at finding himself mistaken after all--at least so far as regarded\r\nAlex, who had been only going on with his sport to the last moment, and\r\nnow taking off his skates, vaulted over the gate, and ran at full speed\r\nafter the rest of the party, overtaking them before they reached the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nHenrietta was sadly disappointed when, looking round at the sound of\r\nfootsteps, she saw him instead of her brother. His refusal to go to\r\nChurch grieved her more than his disobedience, on which she did not in\r\ngeneral look with sufficient seriousness, and for which in the present\r\ncase there were many extenuating circumstances, which she longed to\r\nplead to Uncle Geoffrey, who would, she thought, relax in his severity\r\ntowards her poor Fred, if he knew how long he had waited, and how\r\nmuch he had been teased. This, however, she could not tell him without\r\ncomplaining of his daughter, and in fact it was an additional pain\r\nthat Queen Bee should have used all her powerful influence in the wrong\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to be long vexed with the little Busy Bee, even in\r\nsuch circumstances as these, especially when she came up to her, put\r\nher arm into hers, and looked into her face with all the sweetness that\r\ncould sometimes reside in those brown features of hers, saying, "My\r\npoor Henrietta, I am afraid we have been putting you to torture all this\r\ntime, but you know that it is quite nonsense to be afraid of anything\r\nhappening."\r\n\r\n"O yes, I know that, but really, Queenie, you should not have persuaded\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"I? Well, I believe it was rather naughty of me to laugh at him, for\r\npersuade him I did not, but if you had but seen him in the point I did,\r\nand known how absurd you two poor disconsolate creatures looked, you\r\nwould not have been able to help it. And how was I to know that he would\r\ngo into the only dangerous place he could find, just by way of bravado?\r\nI could have beaten myself when I saw that, but it is all safe, and no\r\nharm done."\r\n\r\n"There is your papa displeased with him."\r\n\r\n"O, I will settle that; I will tell him it was half of it my fault, and\r\nbeg him to say nothing about it. And as for Fred--I should like to make\r\na charade of fool-hardy, with a personal application. Did you ever act a\r\ncharade, Henrietta?"\r\n\r\n"Never; I scarcely know what it is."\r\n\r\n"O charming, charming! What rare fun we will have! I wish I had not told\r\nyou of fool-hardy, for now we can\'t have that, but this evening, O, this\r\nevening, I am no Queen Bee if you do not see what will amaze you! Alex!\r\nAlex! Where is the boy? I must speak to you this instant."\r\n\r\nPouncing upon Alexander, she drew him a little behind the others, and\r\nwas presently engaged in an eager low-voiced conference, apparently\r\npersuading him to something much against his inclination, but Henrietta\r\nwas not sufficiently happy to bestow much curiosity on the subject. All\r\nher thoughts were with Fred, and she had not long been in Church before\r\nall her mother\'s fears seemed to have passed to her. Her mother had\r\nrecovered her serenity, and was able to trust her boy in the hands of\r\nhis Heavenly Father, while Henrietta, haunted by the remembrance of\r\nmany a moral tale, was tormenting herself with the expectation of\r\nretribution, and dwelling on a fancied figure of her brother lifted\r\nsenseless out of the water, with closed eyes and dripping hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all her faults, Queen Bee was a good-natured, generous little\r\nthing, and it was not what every one would have done, when, as soon as\r\nshe returned from Church, she followed her father to the study, saying,\r\n"Papa, you must not be displeased with Fred, for he was very much\r\nplagued, and he only had just begun when you came."\r\n\r\n"The other boys had been teasing him?"\r\n\r\n"Dick had been laughing at him, saying his mamma would not let him go on\r\nthe ice, and that, you know, was past all bearing. And honestly, it was\r\nmy fault too; I laughed, not at that joke, of course, for it was only\r\nworthy of Dick himself, but at poor Fred\'s own disconsolate looks."\r\n\r\n"Was not his case unpleasant enough, without your making it worse?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, papa, I ought to have been more considerate, but you know\r\nhow easily I am run away with by high spirits."\r\n\r\n"And I know you have the power to restrain them, Beatrice. You have no\r\nright to talk of being run away with, as if you were helpless."\r\n\r\n"I know it is very wrong; I often think I will check myself, but\r\nthere are many speeches which, when once they come to my lips, are\r\nirresistible, or seem so. However, I will not try to justify myself; I\r\nknow I was to blame, only you must not be angry with Fred, for it really\r\ndid seem rather unreasonable to keep him there parading about with\r\nHenrietta and Jessie, when the ice was quite safe for everybody else."\r\n\r\n"I am not angry with him, Bee; I cannot but be sorry that he gave way\r\nto the temptation, but there was so much to excuse him, that I shall not\r\nshow any further displeasure. He is often in a very vexatious position\r\nfor a boy of his age. I can imagine nothing more galling than these\r\nrestraints."\r\n\r\n"And cannot you--" said Beatrice, stopping short.\r\n\r\n"Speak to your aunt? I will not make her miserable. Anything she thinks\r\nright she will do, at whatever cost to herself, and for that very\r\nreason I will not interfere. It is a great deal better for Fred that\r\nhis amusement should be sacrificed to her peace, than her peace to his\r\namusement."\r\n\r\n"Yet surely this cannot go on for life," said Beatrice, as if she was\r\nhalf afraid to hazard the remark.\r\n\r\n"Never mind the future. She will grow more used to the other boys, and\r\ngain more confidence in Fred. Things will right themselves, if we do\r\nnot set them wrong. And now, mark me. You are not a mere child, who can\r\nplead the excuse of thoughtlessness for leading him into mischief;\r\nyou know the greatness of the sin of disobedience, and the fearful\r\nresponsibility incurred by conducing to it in others. Do not help to\r\nlead him astray for the sake of--of vanity--of amusement."\r\n\r\nSomething in the manner in which he pronounced these words conveyed to\r\nBeatrice a sense of the emptiness and worthlessness of her motives,\r\nand she answered earnestly, "I was wrong, papa; I know it is a love of\r\nsaying clever things that often leads me wrong. It was so to-day, for\r\nI could have stopped myself, but for the pleasure of making fun. It is\r\nvanity, and I will try to subdue it."\r\n\r\nBeatrice had a sort of candid way of reasoning about her faults, and\r\nwould blame herself, and examine her motives in a manner which disarmed\r\nreproof by forestalling it. She was perfectly sincere, yet it was\r\nself-deception, for it was not as if it was herself whom she was\r\nanalysing, but rather as if it was some character in a book; indeed, she\r\nwould have described herself almost exactly as she is here described,\r\nexcept that her delineation would have been much more clever and more\r\nexact. She would not have spared herself--for this reason, that her\r\nown character was more a study to her than a reality, her faults rather\r\ncircumstances than sins; it was her mind, rather than her soul, that\r\nreflected and made resolutions, or more correctly, what would have been\r\nresolutions, if they had possessed any real earnestness, and not been\r\ndone, as it were, mechanically, because they became the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was concluded by the sound of the luncheon bell, and\r\nshe ran up to take off her bonnet, her thoughts taking the following\r\ncourse: "I am very sorry; it is too bad to tease poor Fred, cruel and\r\nwrong, and all that, only if he would not look absurd! It is too droll\r\nto see how provoked he is, when I take the least notice of Alex, and\r\nafter all, I don\'t think he cares for me half as much as Alex does, only\r\nit flatters his vanity. Those great boys are really quite as vain as\r\ngirls, not Alex though, good downright fellow, who would do anything for\r\nme, and I have put him to a hard proof to-night. What a capital thought\r\nthose charades are! Fred will meet the others on common, nay, on\r\nsuperior ground, and there will be none of these foolish questions who\r\ncan be most manly mad. Fred is really a fine spirited fellow though, and\r\nI thought papa could not find it in his heart to be angry with him. How\r\ncapitally he will act, and how lovely Henrietta will look! I must make\r\nthem take to the charades, it will be so very delightful, and keep Fred\r\nquite out of mischief, which will set Aunt Mary at ease. And how amused\r\ngrandpapa will be! What shall it be to-night? What Alex can manage to\r\nact tolerably. Ce n\'est que le premier pas qui conte, and the premier\r\npas must be with our best foot foremost. I give myself credit for the\r\nthought; it will make all smooth."\r\n\r\nThese meditations occupied her during a hasty toilette and a still more\r\nrapid descent, and were abruptly concluded by her alighting from her\r\nswinging jump down the last four steps close to Fred himself, who was\r\nstanding by the hall fire with a gloomy expression of countenance,\r\nwhich with inconsiderate good nature she hastened to remove. "Don\'t look\r\ndismal, Freddy; I have told papa all about it, and he does not mind it.\r\nCheer up, you adventurous knight, I have some glorious fun for you this\r\nevening."\r\n\r\nNot mind it! The impression thus conveyed to one but too willing to\r\nreceive it, was that Uncle Geoffrey, that external conscience, thought\r\nhim excused from attending to unreasonable prohibitions. Away went all\r\nthe wholesome self-reproach which he had begun to feel, away went all\r\nfear of Uncle Geoffrey\'s eye, all compunction in meeting his mother,\r\nand he entered the dining-room in such lively spirits that his uncle\r\nwas vexed to see him so unconcerned, and his mother felt sure that her\r\nentreaty had not been disregarded. She never heard to the contrary, for\r\nshe liked better to trust than to ask questions, and he, like far too\r\nmany boys, did not think concealment blameable where there was no actual\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\nAll the time they were at table, Queen Bee was in one of her states of\r\nwild restlessness, and the instant she was at liberty she flew away,\r\nand was seen no more that afternoon, except in certain flittings into\r\ndifferent apartments, where she appeared for a moment or two with some\r\nextraordinary and mysterious request. First she popped upon grandpapa,\r\nand with the expense of a little coaxing and teasing, obtained from him\r\nthe loan of his Deputy-Lieutenant\'s uniform; then she darted into the\r\ndrawing-room, on hearing Uncle Roger\'s voice, and conjured him not to\r\nforget to give a little note to Alex, containing these words, "Willy\r\nmust wear his cap without a peak. Bring Roger\'s dirk, and above all,\r\nbeg, borrow, or steal, Uncle Roger\'s fishing boots." Her next descent\r\nwas upon Aunt Mary, in her own room: "Aunt, would you do me a great\r\nfavour, and ask no questions, nor tell Henrietta? Do just lend me the\r\nthree little marabout feathers which you had in your cap yesterday\r\nevening. Only for this one evening, and I\'ll take great care."\r\n\r\n"I am sure, my dear, you are very welcome to them; I do not feel like\r\nmyself in such finery," said Mrs. Frederick Langford, smiling, as\r\nBeatrice took possession of the elegant little white cap, which she had\r\nthe discretion to carry to Bennet, its lawful protector, to be bereft\r\nof its plumed honours. Bennet, an old friend of nursery days, was in\r\nthe secret of her plans for the evening; her head-quarters were in the\r\nwork-room, which had often served her as a playroom in days gone by, and\r\nJudith, gratified by a visit from "Miss Bee," dived for her sake into\r\nboxes and drawers, amid hoards where none but Judith would have dared to\r\nrummage.\r\n\r\nAll this might ultimately be for Henrietta\'s entertainment, but at\r\npresent it did not much conduce towards it, as she was left to her own\r\nresources in the drawing-room. She practised a little, worked a little,\r\nlistened to a consultation between grandpapa and Uncle Roger, about the\r\nnew pig-sty, wrote it down in her list when they went into the study to\r\nask Uncle Geoffrey\'s advice, tried to talk over things in general with\r\nher mamma, but found it impossible with grandmamma continually coming\r\nin and out of the room, yawned, wondered what Busy Bee was about, felt\r\ndeserted, gave up work, and had just found an entertaining book, when\r\ngrandmamma came in, and invited her to visit the poultry yard. She\r\nreadily accepted, but for want of Queen Bee to hurry her, kept her\r\ngrandmamma waiting longer than she liked, and had more of a scolding\r\nthan was agreeable. The chickens were all gone to roost by the time they\r\narrived, the cock just peering down at them with his coral-bordered eye,\r\nand the ducks waddling stealthily in one by one, the feeding was over,\r\nthe hen-wife gone, and Mrs. Langford vexed at being too late.\r\n\r\nHenrietta was annoyed with herself and with the result of the day, but\r\nshe had some consolation, for as they were going towards the house,\r\nthey met Mr. Langford, who called out, "So you have been walking with\r\ngrandmamma! Well, if you are not tired, come and have a little turn with\r\ngrandpapa. I am going to speak to Daniels, the carpenter, and my \'merry\r\nChristmas\' will be twice as welcome to his old father, if I take you\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nHenrietta might be a little tired, but such an invitation was not to be\r\nrefused, and she was at her grandpapa\'s side in an instant, thanking him\r\nso much that he laughed and said the favour was to him. "I wish we had\r\nFred here too," said he, as they walked on, "the old man will be very\r\nglad to see you."\r\n\r\n"Was he one of mamma\'s many admirers in the village?"\r\n\r\n"All the village admired Miss Mary, but it was your father who was\r\nold Daniels\' chief friend. The boys used to have a great taste for\r\ncarpentry, especially your father, who was always at his elbow when he\r\nwas at work at the Hall. Poor old man, I thought he would never have\r\nheld up his head again when our great trouble came on us. He used to\r\ntouch his hat, and turn away without looking me in the face. And there\r\nyou may see stuck up over the chimney-piece in his cottage the new\r\nchisel that your father gave him when he had broken his old one."\r\n\r\n"Dear old man!" said Henrietta, warmly, "I am so very glad that we have\r\ncome here, where people really care for us, and are interested in us,\r\nand not for our own sake. How delightful it is! I feel as if we were\r\ncome out of banishment."\r\n\r\n"Well, it is all the better for you," said Mr. Langford; "if we had\r\nhad you here, depend upon it, we should have spoilt you. We have so few\r\ngranddaughters that we cannot help making too much of them. There is\r\nthat little Busy Bee--by the by, what is her plan this evening, or are\r\nnot you in her secret?"\r\n\r\n"O no, I believe she is to surprise us all. I met her just before I came\r\nout dragging a huge bag after her: I wanted to help her, but she would\r\nnot let me."\r\n\r\n"She turns us all round her finger," said grandpapa. "I never found the\r\nperson who could resist Queen Bee, except grandmamma. But I am glad you\r\ndo not take after her, Henrietta, for one such grandchild is enough, and\r\nit is better for woman-kind to have leadable spirits than leading."\r\n\r\n"O, grandpapa!"\r\n\r\n"That is a dissentient O. What does it mean? Out with it."\r\n\r\n"Only that I was thinking about weakness; I beg your pardon, grandpapa."\r\n\r\n"Look here!" and Mr. Langford bent the slender cane in his hand (he\r\ndisdained a stronger walking-stick) to its full extent of suppleness.\r\n"Is this weak?"\r\n\r\n"No, it is strong in energy," said Henrietta, laughing, as the elastic\r\ncane sprang back to its former shape.\r\n\r\n"Yet to a certain point you can bend it as far as you please. Well, that\r\nshould be the way with you: be turned any way but the wrong, and let\r\nyour own determination be only to keep upright."\r\n\r\n"But women are admired for influence."\r\n\r\n"Influence is a good thing in its way, but only of a good sort when it\r\nis unconscious. At any rate, when you set to work to influence people,\r\ntake care it is only with a view to their good, and not to your own\r\npersonal wishes, or influencing becomes a dangerous trade, especially\r\nfor young ladies towards their elders."\r\n\r\nGrandpapa, who had only seen Henrietta carried about by Beatrice,\r\ngrandmamma, or Fred, and willing to oblige them all, had little idea how\r\napplicable to her case was his general maxim, nor indeed did she at the\r\nmoment take it to herself, although it was one day to return upon her.\r\nIt brought them to the neat cottage of the carpenter, with the thatched\r\nworkshop behind, and the garden in front, which would have looked neat\r\nbut for the melancholy aspect of the frost-bitten cabbages.\r\n\r\nThis was Henrietta\'s first cottage visit, and she was all eagerness\r\nand interest, picturing to herself a venerable old man, almost as\r\nfine-looking as her grandfather, and as eloquent as old men in cottages\r\nalways are in books; but she found it rather a disappointing meeting. It\r\nwas a very nice trim-looking daughter-in-law who opened the door, on\r\nMr. Langford\'s knock, and the room was neatness itself, but the old\r\ncarpenter was not at all what she had imagined. He was a little stooping\r\nold man, with a shaking head, and weak red eyes under a green shade, and\r\ndid not seem to have anything to say beyond "Yes, sir," and "Thank\r\nyou, sir," when Mr. Langford shouted into his deaf ears some of\r\nthe "compliments of the season." Looking at the young lady, whom he\r\nevidently mistook for Beatrice, he hoped that Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey were\r\nquite well. His face lighted up a little for a moment when Mr. Langford\r\ntold him this was Mr. Frederick\'s daughter, but it was only for an\r\ninstant, and in a somewhat querulous voice he asked if there was not a\r\nyoung gentleman too.\r\n\r\n"O yes," said Mr. Langford, "he shall come and see you some day."\r\n\r\n"He would not care to see a poor old man," said Daniels, turning a\r\nlittle away, while his daughter-in-law began to apologise for him by\r\nsaying, "He is more lost than usual to-day, sir; I think it was getting\r\ntired going to church, yesterday morning; he did not sleep well, and he\r\nhas been so fretful all the morning, a body did not know what to do with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nMr. Langford said a few more cheerful words to the poor old man, then\r\nasked the daughter where her husband was, and, hearing that he was in\r\nthe workshop, refused offers of fetching him in, and went out to speak\r\nto him, leaving Henrietta to sit by the fire and wait for him. A weary\r\nwaiting time she found it; shy as she was of poor people, as of a class\r\nwith whom she was utterly unacquainted, feeling bound to make herself\r\nagreeable, but completely ignorant how to set about it, wishing to talk\r\nto the old man, and fearing to neglect him, but finding conversation\r\nquite impossible except with Mrs. Daniels, and not very easy with\r\nher--she tried to recollect what storied young ladies did say to old\r\nmen, but nothing she could think of would do, or was what she could find\r\nherself capable of saying. At last she remembered, in "Gertrude," the\r\nold nurse\'s complaint that Laura did not inquire after the rheumatism,\r\nand she hazarded her voice in expressing a hope that Mr. Daniels did not\r\nsuffer from it. Clear as the sweet voice was, it was too tremulous (for\r\nshe was really in a fright of embarrassment) to reach the old man\'s\r\near, and his daughter-in-law took it upon her to repeat the inquiry in\r\na shrill sharp scream, that almost went through her ears; then while\r\nthe old man was answering something in a muttering maundering way, she\r\nproceeded with a reply, and told a long story about his ways with the\r\ndoctor, in her Sussex dialect, almost incomprehensible to Henrietta. The\r\nconversation dropped, until Mrs. Daniels began hoping that every one at\r\nthe Hall was quite well, and as she inquired after them one by one,\r\nthis took up a reasonable time; but then again followed a silence. Mrs.\r\nDaniels was not a native of Knight Sutton, or she would have had more to\r\nsay about Henrietta\'s mother; but she had never seen her before, and had\r\nnone of that interest in her that half the parish felt. Henrietta wished\r\nthere had been a baby to notice, but she saw no trace in the room of the\r\nexistence of children, and did not like to ask if there were any. She\r\nlooked at the open hearth, and said it was very comfortable, and was\r\ntold in return that it made a great draught, and smoked very much. Then\r\nshe bethought herself of admiring an elaborately worked frame sampler,\r\nthat hung against the wall; and the conversation this supplied lasted\r\nher till, to her great joy, grandpapa made his appearance again, and\r\nsummoned her to return, as it was already growing very dark.\r\n\r\nShe thought he might have made something of an apology for the\r\ndisagreeableness of his friend; but, being used to it, and forgetting\r\nthat she was not, he did no such thing; and she was wondering that\r\ncottage visiting could ever have been represented as so pleasant an\r\noccupation, when he began on a far more interesting subject, asking\r\nabout her mother\'s health, and how she thought Knight Sutton agreed with\r\nher, saying how very glad he was to have her there again, and how like\r\nhis own daughter she had always been. He went on to tell of his first\r\nsight of his two daughters-in-law, when, little guessing that they would\r\nbe such, he went to fetch home the little Mary Vivian, who had come from\r\nIndia under the care of General St. Leger. "There they were," said he;\r\n"I can almost see them now, as their black nurse led them in; your aunt\r\na brown little sturdy thing, ready to make acquaintance in a moment,\r\nand your mamma such a fair, shrinking, fragile morsel of a child, that I\r\nfelt quite ashamed to take her among all my great scrambling boys."\r\n\r\n"Ah! mamma says her recollection is all in bits and scraps; she\r\nrecollects the ship, and she remembers sitting on your knee in a\r\ncarriage; but she cannot remember either the parting with Aunt Geoffrey\r\nor the coming here."\r\n\r\n"I do not remember about the parting with Aunt Geoffrey; they managed\r\nthat in the nursery, I believe, but I shall never forget the boys\r\nreceiving her,--Fred and Geoffrey, I mean,--for Roger was at school. How\r\nthey admired her like some strange curiosity, and played with her like\r\na little girl with a new doll. There was no fear that they would be too\r\nrough with her, for they used to touch her as if she was made of glass.\r\nAnd what a turn out of old playthings there was in her service!"\r\n\r\n"That was when she was six," said Henrietta, "and papa must have been\r\nten."\r\n\r\n"Yes, thereabouts, and Geoffrey a year younger. How they did pet her!\r\nand come down to all their old baby-plays again for her sake, till I was\r\nalmost afraid that cricket and hockey would be given up and forgotten."\r\n\r\n"And were they?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, trust boys for that. Little Mary came to be looker on, if she\r\ndid not sometimes play herself. She was distressed damsel, and they\r\nknight and giant, or dragon, or I cannot tell what, though many\'s the\r\ntime I have laughed over it. Whatever they pleased was she: never lived\r\ncreature more without will of her own."\r\n\r\n"Never," responded Henrietta; but that for which Mr. Langford\r\nmight commend his little Mary at seven years old, did not appear so\r\nappropriate a subject of observation in Mrs. Frederick Langford, and by\r\nher own daughter.\r\n\r\n"Eh!" said her grandfather. Then answering his mental objection in\r\nanother tone, "Ay, ay, no will for her own pleasure; that depends more\r\non you than on any one else."\r\n\r\n"I would do anything on earth for her!" said Henrietta, feeling it from\r\nthe bottom of her heart.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you would, my dear," said Mr. Langford, "and she deserves it.\r\nThere are few like her, and few that have gone through so much. To think\r\nof her as she was when last she was here and to look at her now! Well,\r\nit won\'t do to talk of it; but I thought when I saw her face yesterday,\r\nthat I could see, as well as believe, it was all for the best for her,\r\nas I am sure it was for us."\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted just as they reached the gate by the voice of his\r\neldest son calling "Out late, sir," and looking round, Henrietta saw\r\nwhat looked in the darkness like a long procession, Uncle and Aunt\r\nRoger, and their niece, and all the boys, as far down as William, coming\r\nto the Hall for the regular Christmas dinner-party.\r\n\r\nJoining company, Henrietta walked with Jessie and answered her inquiries\r\nwhether she had got wet or cold in the morning; but it was in an absent\r\nmanner, for she was all the time dwelling on what her grandfather had\r\nbeen saying. She was calling up in imagination the bright scenes of her\r\nmother\'s youth; those delightful games of which she had often heard, and\r\nwhich she could place in their appropriate setting now that she knew the\r\nscenes. She ran up to her room, where she found only Bennet, her mother\r\nhaving dressed and gone down; and sitting down before the fire, and\r\nresigning her curls to her maid, she let herself dwell on the ideas the\r\nconversation had called up, turning from the bright to the darker side.\r\nShe pictured to herself the church, the open grave, her uncles and her\r\ngrandfather round it, the villagers taking part in their grief, the old\r\ncarpenter\'s averted head--she thought what must have been the agony of\r\nthe moment, of laying in his untimely grave one so fondly loved, on whom\r\nthe world was just opening so brightly,--and the young wife--the\r\ninfant children--how fearful it must have been! "It was almost a cruel\r\ndispensation," thought Henrietta. "O, how happy and bright we might have\r\nbeen! What would it not have been to hold by his hand, to have his kiss,\r\nto look for his smile! And mamma, to have had her in all her joyousness\r\nand blitheness, with no ill health, and no cares! O, why was it not so?\r\nAnd yet grandpapa said it was for the best! And in what a manner he did\r\nsay it, as if he really felt and saw, and knew the advantage of it!\r\nTo dear papa himself I know it was for the best, but for us, mamma,\r\ngrandpapa--no, I never shall understand it. They were good before; why\r\ndid they need punishment? Is this what is called saying \'Thy will be\r\ndone?\' Then I shall never be able to say it, and yet I ought!"\r\n\r\n"Your head a little higher, if you please, Miss Henrietta," said Bennet;\r\n"it is that makes me so long dressing you, and your mamma has been\r\ntelling me that I must get you ready faster."\r\n\r\nHenrietta slightly raised her head for the moment, but soon let it sink\r\nagain in her musings, and when Bennet reminded her, replied, "I can\'t,\r\nBennet, it breaks my neck." Her will was not with her mother\'s, in a\r\ntrifling matter of which the reasonableness could not but approve itself\r\nto her. How, then, was it likely to be bent to that of her Heavenly\r\nParent, in what is above reason?\r\n\r\nThe toilet was at length completed, and in time for her to be handed\r\nin to dinner by Alexander, an honour which she owed to Beatrice having\r\nalready been secured by Frederick, who was resolved not to be again\r\nabandoned to Jessie. Alex did not favour her with much conversation,\r\npartly because he was thinking with perturbation of the task set him for\r\nthe evening, and partly because he was trying to hear what Queen Bee was\r\nsaying to Fred, in the midst of the clatter of knives and forks, and the\r\nloud voice of Mr. Roger Langford, which was enough to drown most other\r\nsounds. Some inquiries had been made about Mrs. Geoffrey Langford and\r\nher aunt, Lady Susan St. Leger, which had led Beatrice into a great\r\nlamentation for her mother\'s absence, and from thence into a description\r\nof what Lady Susan exacted from her friends. "Aunt Susan is a regular\r\nfidget," said she; "not such a fidget as some people," with an\r\nindication of Mrs. Langford. "Some people are determined to make others\r\ncomfortable in a way of their own, and that is a fidget to be regarded\r\nwith considerable respect; but Aunt Susan\'s fidgeting takes the turn\r\nof sacrificing the comfort of every one else to her own and her little\r\ndog\'s."\r\n\r\n"But that is very hard on Aunt Geoffrey," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Frightfully. Any one who was less selfish would have insisted on\r\nmamma\'s coming here, instead of which Aunt Susan only complains of her\r\nsister and brother, and everybody else, for going out of London, when\r\nshe may be taken suddenly ill at any time. She is in such a nervous\r\nstate that Mr. Peyton cannot tell what might be the consequence," said\r\nBeatrice, in an imitative tone, which made Fred laugh.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I should leave her to take care of herself," said he.\r\n\r\n"So do the whole family except ourselves; they are all worn out by\r\nher querulousness, and are not particularly given to patience or\r\nunselfishness either. But mamma is really fond of her, because she was\r\nkind to her when she came home from India, and she manages to keep her\r\nquiet better than anyone else can. She can very seldom resist mamma\'s\r\ncheerful voice, which drives off half her nerves at once. You cannot\r\nthink how funny it is to see how Aunt Amelia always seems to stroke the\r\ncat the wrong way, and mamma to smooth her down the right."\r\n\r\nA lull in the conversation left these last words audible, and Mr.\r\nLangford said, "What is that about stroking the cat, Queenie?"\r\n\r\n"O you are telling it all--O don\'t, Bee!" cried Willy.\r\n\r\nAnd with certain jokes about cats and bags, which seemed excessively to\r\ndiscomfit Willy, who protested the cat was not in the bag at all--it\r\nwas the partridges--the conversation drifted away again from the younger\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAs soon as dinner was over, Beatrice again disappeared, after begging\r\nher grandmamma to allow the great Indian screen to remain as it at\r\npresent stood, spread out so as to cut off one end of the room, where\r\nthere was a door opening into the study. Behind this screen frequent\r\nrustlings were heard, with now and then a burst of laughing or\r\nwhispering, and a sound of moving furniture, which so excited Mrs.\r\nLangford, that, starting up, she exclaimed that she must go and see what\r\nthey were doing.\r\n\r\n"We are taking great care, grandmamma," called Alexander. "We won\'t hurt\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThis, by showing so far that there was something to be hurt, was so far\r\nfrom reassuring her, that she would certainly have set out on a voyage\r\nof discovery, but for Mr. Langford, who professed himself convinced that\r\nall was right, and said he would not have the Busy Bee disturbed.\r\n\r\nShe came in to tea, bringing Alex and Willy with her--the latter, in a\r\nmarvellous state of mystery and excitement, longing to tell all himself,\r\nand yet in great terror lest the others should tell.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tea was despatched, the three actors departed, and\r\npresently there was a call from behind the screen, "Are you ready, good\r\npeople?"\r\n\r\n"Go it," answered Carey.\r\n\r\n"Are the elders ready?" said Beatrice\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Papa, don\'t go on talking to Uncle Geoffrey!" cried Willy.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, all attention," said grandpapa. "Now for it!"\r\n\r\nThe screen was folded back, and discovered Alex in a pasteboard crown,\r\nermine tippet, and purple mantle, sitting enthroned with Beatrice (a\r\ntiara and feathers on her head) at his side, and kneeling before them\r\na nondescript article, consisting chiefly of a fur cloak, a fur cap,\r\nadorned with a pair of grey squirrel cuffs, sewn ingeniously into the\r\nform of ears, a boa by way of tail, and an immense pair of boots.\r\nAs Uncle Geoffrey said, the cat was certainly out of the bag, and it\r\nproceeded in due form to take two real partridges from the bag, and\r\npresent them to the king and princess in the name of the Marquis\r\nCarabbas.\r\n\r\nThe king and princess made some consultation as to who the marquis\r\nmight be, the princess proposing to send for the Peerage, and the king\r\ncross-examining puss in an incredulous way which greatly puzzled him,\r\nuntil at last he bethought himself of exclaiming, in a fierce manner,\r\n"I\'ve told you the truth, Mr. King, and if you won\'t believe me, I can\'t\r\nhelp it!" and walked off on his hind legs in as dignified and resentful\r\na manner as his boots would let him; repairing to the drawing-room to\r\nhave his accoutrements admired, while the screen was again spread in\r\npreparation for Scene II.\r\n\r\nScene II. presented but a half-length, a shawl being hung in front, so\r\nas to conceal certain incongruities. A great arm-chair was wheeled close\r\nto the table, on which stood an aged black jack out of the hall, a quart\r\nmeasure, and a silver tankard; while in the chair, a cushion on his\r\nhead, and a great carving-knife held like a sceptre in his hand,\r\nreclined Alex, his bulk enlarged by at least two pillows, over which an\r\nold, long-breasted white satin waistcoat, embroidered with silver, had\r\nwith some difficulty been brought to meet. Before him stood a little\r\nfigure in a cloth cap, set jauntily on one side, decorated with a fox\'s\r\nbrush, and with Mrs. Frederick Langford\'s three feathers, and a coat\r\nbearing marvellous resemblance to Beatrice\'s own black velvet spencer,\r\ncrossed over one shoulder by a broad blue ribbon, which Henrietta knew\r\nfull well. "Do thou stand for my father," began this droll little shape,\r\n"and examine me in the particulars of my life."\r\n\r\nIt was not badly carried out; Prince Henry, when he did not giggle,\r\nacted beautifully; and Falstaff really did very well, though his eyes\r\nwere often directed downwards, and the curious, by standing on tiptoe,\r\nobtained not only a view of Prince Hal\'s pink petticoat, but of a great\r\nShakespeare laid open on the floor; and a very low bow on the part of\r\nthe heir apparent, when about to change places with his fat friend, was\r\nstrongly suspected of being for the purpose of turning over a leaf. It\r\nwas with great spirit that the parting appeal was given, "Banish fat\r\nJack, and banish all the world!" And there was great applause when fat\r\nJack and Prince Hal jumped up and drew the screen forward again;\r\nthough Uncle Geoffrey and Aunt Mary were cruel enough to utter certain\r\nhistorical and antiquarian doubts as to whether the Prince of Wales was\r\nlikely to wear the three feathers and ribbon of the garter in his haunts\r\nat Eastcheap.\r\n\r\nIn the concluding scene the deputy lieutenant\'s uniform made a great\r\nfigure, with the addition of the long-breasted waistcoat, a white scarf,\r\nand the white cockade, adorning Alex, who, with a boot-jack under his\r\narm, looked as tall and as rigid as he possibly could, with a very low\r\nbow, which was gracefully returned by a royal personage in a Scottish\r\nbonnet, also bearing the white cockade, a tartan scarf, and the blue\r\nribbon. Altogether, Prince Charles Edward and the Baron of Bradwardine\r\nstood confessed; the character was solemnly read, and the shoe pulled\r\noff, or supposed to be, as the lower screen still remained to cut off\r\nthe view; and then the Baron indulged in a lengthy yawn and stretch,\r\nwhile Prince Charlie, skipping into the midst of the audience, danced\r\nround Mr. Langford, asking if he had guessed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeatrice had not judged amiss when she thought charade-acting an\r\namusement likely to take the fancy of her cousins. The great success of\r\nher boot-jack inspired both Frederick and Henrietta with eagerness to\r\nimitate it; and nothing was talked of but what was practicable in the\r\nway of scenes, words, and decorations. The Sutton Leigh party were\r\nto dine at the Hall again on Thursday, and it was resolved that there\r\nshould be a grand charade, with all the splendour that due preparation\r\ncould bestow upon it. "It was such an amusement to grandpapa," as\r\nBeatrice told Henrietta, "and it occupied Fred so nicely," as she\r\nsaid to her father; both which observations being perfectly true,\r\nMr. Geoffrey Langford was very willing to promote the sport, and to\r\ntranquillise his mother respecting the disarrangement of her furniture.\r\n\r\nBut what should the word be? Every one had predilections of their\r\nown--some for comedy, others for tragedy; some for extemporary acting,\r\nothers for Shakespeare. Beatrice, with her eye for drawing, already\r\ngrouped her dramatis personae, so as to display Henrietta\'s picturesque\r\nface and figure to the greatest advantage, and had designs of making her\r\nand Fred represent Catherine and Henry Seyton, whom, as she said, she\r\nhad always believed to be exactly like them. Fred was inclined for\r\n"another touch at Prince Hal," and devised numerous ways of acting\r\nAnonymous, for the sake of "Anon, anon, sir." Henrietta wanted to\r\ncontrive something in which Queen Bee might appear as an actual fairy\r\nbee, and had very pretty visions of making her a beneficent spirit in a\r\nlittle fanciful opera, for which she had written three or four verses,\r\nwhen Fred put an end to it be pronouncing it "nonsense and humbug."\r\n\r\nSo passed Tuesday, without coming to any decision, and Henrietta was\r\nbeginning to fear that they would never fix at all, when on Wednesday\r\nmorning Beatrice came down in an ecstasy with the news, that by some\r\nchance a wig of her papa\'s was in the house, and a charade they must and\r\nwould have which would bring in the wig. "Come and see it," said she,\r\ndrawing her two cousins into the study after breakfast: the study being\r\nthe safest place for holding counsel on these secret subjects. "There\r\nnow, is it not charming? O, a law charade we must have, that is\r\ncertain!"\r\n\r\nFred and Henrietta, who had never chanced to see a barrister\'s wig\r\nbefore, were greatly diverted with its little tails, and tried it on in\r\nturn. While Henrietta was in the midst of her laugh at the sight of\r\nher own fair ringlets hanging out below the tight grey rolls, the door\r\nsuddenly opened, and gave entrance to its owner, fiercely exclaiming,\r\n"What! nothing safe from you, you impertinent kittens?"\r\n\r\n"O, Uncle Geoffrey, I beg your pardon!" cried Henrietta, blushing\r\ncrimson.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t take it off till I have looked at you," said Uncle Geoffrey.\r\n"Why, you would make a capital Portia!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" cried Queen Bee, "that is it: Portia she shall be, and I\'ll\r\nbe Nerissa."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Queenie, I could never be Portia!" said Henrietta: "I am sure I\r\ncan\'t."\r\n\r\n"But I have set my heart on being the \'little scrubby lawyer\'s clerk,\'"\r\nsaid Busy Bee; "it is what I am just fit for; and let me see--Fred shall\r\nbe Antonio, and that will make you plead from your very heart, and you\r\nshall have Alex for your Bassanio."\r\n\r\n"But the word. Do you mean to make it fit in with Falstaff and Catherine\r\nSeyton?" said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Let me see," said Beatrice; "bond--bondage, jew--jeweller, juniper,--"\r\n\r\n"Lawsuit," said Fred. "Ay, don\'t you see, all the scenes would come out\r\nof the \'Merchant of Venice.\' There is \'law\' when the old Jew is crying\r\nout for his ducats, and--but halloo!" and Fred stood aghast at the sight\r\nof his uncle, whose presence they had all forgotten in their eagerness.\r\n\r\n"Traitor!" said Beatrice; "but never mind, I believe we must have let\r\nhim into the plot, for nobody else can be Shylock."\r\n\r\n"O, Bee," whispered Henrietta, reproachfully, "don\'t tease him with our\r\nnonsense. Think of asking him to study Shylock\'s part, when he has all\r\nthat pile of papers on the table."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Jessica, my girl, Look to my house. I am right loth to go; There is\r\nsome ill a-brewing to my rest, For I did dream of money-bags to-night."\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was Uncle Geoffrey\'s reply; his face and tone so suddenly altered\r\nto the snarl of the old Jew, that his young companions at first started,\r\nand then clapped their hands in delighted admiration.\r\n\r\n"Do you really know it all?" asked Henrietta, in a sort of respectful\r\nawe.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t cost me much trouble to get it up," said Mr. Geoffrey\r\nLangford; "Shylock\'s growls stick in one\'s memory better than finer\r\nspeeches."\r\n\r\n"Then will you really be so very kind?"\r\n\r\n"Provided you will leave the prompter of Monday night on the table\r\nthis morning," said Uncle Geoffrey, smiling in that manner which, to a\r\ncertain degree, removed any feeling of obligation, by making it seem as\r\nif it was entirely for his own diversion. Nor could it be denied that he\r\ndid actually enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe party took up their quarters in the study, which really was the only\r\nplace fit for consultations and rehearsals, since Fred and Alex\r\ncould not be taken to the maids\' workroom, and none of the downstairs\r\napartments could be made subject to the confusion incidental to their\r\npreparations. Henrietta had many scruples at first about disturbing\r\nUncle Geoffrey, but his daughter laughed at them all; and they were soon\r\nat an end when she perceived that he minded their chattering, spouting,\r\nand laughing, no more than if they had been so many little sparrows\r\ntwittering on the eaves, but pursued the even tenor of his writing\r\nuninterruptedly, even while she fitted on his head a yellow pointed cap,\r\nwhich her ingenious fingers had compounded of the lining of certain ugly\r\nold curtains.\r\n\r\nHis presence in this silent state served, too, as a protection in Mrs.\r\nLangford\'s periodical visitations to stir the fire; but for him, she\r\nwould assuredly have found fault, and probably Beatrice would have\r\ncome to a collision with her, which would have put an end to the whole\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nIt formed a considerable addition to Henrietta\'s list of his avocations,\r\nand really by making the utmost of everything he did for other people\r\nduring that whole week, she made the number reach even to seventy-nine\r\nby the next Thursday morning. The most noted of these employments were\r\nthe looking over a new Act of Parliament with the county member, the\r\ncuring grandmamma\'s old gander of a mysterious lameness, the managing\r\nof an emigration of a whole family to New Zealand, the guessing a riddle\r\nsupposed "to have no answer," and the mending of some extraordinary\r\nspring that was broken in Uncle Roger\'s new drill. Beatrice was charmed\r\nwith the list; Aunt Mary said it was delightful to be so precious to\r\nevery one; and grandpapa, shaking his head at his son, said he was\r\nashamed to find that his family contained such a Jack of all trades; to\r\nwhich Uncle Geoffrey replied, that it was too true that "all work and no\r\nplay make Jack a very dull boy."\r\n\r\nThe breaking up of the frost, with a succession of sleet, snow and\r\nrain, was much in favour of Beatrice and her plans, by taking away\r\nall temptation from the boys to engage in out-of-door amusements; and\r\nAntonio and Bassanio studied their parts so diligently, that Carey\r\nwas heard to observe that it might just as well be half year. They had\r\nbesides their own proper parts, to undertake those of the Princes of\r\nArragon and Morocco, since Queen Bee, willing to have as much of Nerissa\r\nas possible, had determined to put their choice, and that of Bassanio,\r\nall into the one scene belonging to "suit." It was one of those\r\noccasions on which she showed little consideration, for she thus gave\r\nPortia an immense quantity to learn in only two days; persuading herself\r\nall the time that it was no such hard task, since the beautiful\r\nspeech about mercy Henrietta already knew by heart, and she made\r\nno difficulties about the rest. Indeed, Beatrice thought herself\r\nexcessively amiable in doing all she could to show off her cousin\'s\r\nbeauty and acting, whilst taking a subordinate part herself; forgetting\r\nthat humility is not shown in choosing a part, but in taking willingly\r\nthat which is assigned us.\r\n\r\nHenrietta was rather appalled at the quantity she had to learn, as well\r\nas at the prominent part she was to take; but she did not like to spoil\r\nthe pleasure of the rest with objections, and applied herself in good\r\nearnest to her study. She walked about with a little Shakespeare in her\r\nhand; she learnt while she was dressing, working, waiting; sat up late,\r\nresisting many a summons from her mother to come to bed, and long before\r\ndaylight, was up and learning again.\r\n\r\nThe great evening had come, and the audience were thus arranged:\r\ngrandmamma took up her carpet-work, expressing many hopes to Aunt Roger\r\nthat it would be over now and out of the children\'s heads, for they\r\nturned the house upside down, and for her part, she thought it very like\r\nplay-acting. Aunt Roger, returning the sentiment with interest, took out\r\none of the little brown holland frocks, which she seemed to be always\r\nmaking. Uncle Roger composed himself to sleep in the arm-chair for want\r\nof his brother to talk to; grandpapa moved a sofa to the front for Aunt\r\nMary, and sat down by her, declaring that they would see something very\r\npretty, and hoping it would not be too hard a nut for his old wits to\r\ncrack; Jessie, and such of the boys as could not be persuaded to be\r\nmagnificos, found themselves a convenient station, and the scene opened.\r\n\r\nIt was a very short one, but it made every one laugh greatly, thanks to\r\nShylock\'s excellent acting, and the chorus of boys, who greatly enjoyed\r\nchasing him across the stage, crying, "The law, his ducats, and his\r\ndaughter!"\r\n\r\nThen, after a short interval, appeared Portia, a silver arrow in her\r\nhair, almost lovely enough for the real Portia; though the alarmed\r\nexpression in her glowing face was little accordant with the calm\r\ndignified self-possession of the noble Venetian heiress. Nerissa, a\r\nhandkerchief folded squarely over her head, short petticoats, scarlet\r\nlambswool worked into her stockings, and a black apron trimmed with\r\nbright ribbon, made a complete little Italian waiting-maid; her quick,\r\npert reply to her lady\'s first faltering speech, seemed wonderfully to\r\nrestore Portia to herself, and they got on well and with spirit through\r\nthe description of the suitors, and the choice of the two first caskets.\r\nPortia looked excessively dignified, and Nerissa\'s by-play was capital.\r\nWhether it was owing to Bassanio\'s awkwardness or her own shyness,\r\nshe did not prosper quite so well when the leaden casket was chosen;\r\nBassanio seemed more afraid of her than rejoiced, and looked much more\r\nat Nerissa than at her, whilst she moved as slowly, and spoke in as\r\ncold and measured a way, as if it had been the Prince of Morocco who had\r\nunfortunately hit upon the right casket.\r\n\r\nIn the grand concluding scene she was, however, all that could be\r\nwished. She really made a very pretty picture in the dark robes, the\r\nglowing carnation of her cheek contrasting with the grey wig, beneath\r\nwhich a few bright ringlets still peeped out; one little white hand\r\nraised, and the other holding the parchment, and her eyes fixed on the\r\nJew, as if she either imagined herself Portia, or saw her brother in\r\nAntonio\'s case, for they glistened with tears, and her voice had a\r\ntremulous pleading tone, which fairly made her grandfather and mother\r\nboth cry heartily.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Take, then, thy bond; take thou thy pound of flesh!"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke (little Willy) was in an agony, and was forcibly withheld by\r\nBassanio from crying "No, he shan\'t!" Nerissa was so absorbed as even to\r\nhave forgotten herself; Shylock could hardly keep his countenance up to\r\nthe necessary expression of malice and obduracy; even Johnny and Dick\r\nwere hanging with breathless attention on the "but," when suddenly there\r\nwas a general start throughout the party; the door opened; Atkins, with\r\na voice and face full of delight, announced "Master Roger," and there\r\nentered a young man, in a pea jacket and worsted comforter.\r\n\r\nSuch confusion, such rapture as ensued! The tumultuous welcomes and\r\nhandshakings before the sailor had time to distinguish one from another,\r\nthe actors assuming their own characters, grandmamma and Mrs. Roger\r\nLangford asking dozens of questions in a breath, and Mr. Roger Langford\r\nfast asleep in his great arm-chair, till roused by Dick tugging at his\r\narm, and Willy hammering on his knee, he slowly arose, saying, "What,\r\nRoger, my boy, is it you? I thought it was all their acting!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! Miss Jessie," exclaimed Roger; "that is right: I have not seen such\r\na crop of shining curls since I have been gone. So you have not lost\r\nyour pink cheeks with pining for me. How are they all at home?"\r\n\r\n"Here, Roger, your Aunt Mary," said his mother; and instantly there\r\nwas a subduing of the young sailor\'s boisterous mirth, as he turned\r\nto answer her gentle welcome. The laugh arose the next moment at the\r\nappearance of the still half-disguised actors: Alex without Bassanio\'s\r\nshort black cloak and slouched hat and feather, but still retaining his\r\nburnt cork eyebrows and moustache, and wondering that Roger did not know\r\nhim; Uncle Geoffrey still in Shylock\'s yellow cap, and Fred somewhat\r\ngrim with the Prince of Morocco\'s complexion.\r\n\r\n"How d\'ye do, Phil?" said Roger, returning his cousinly shake of the\r\nhand with interest. "What! are not you Philip Carey?"\r\n\r\n"O, Roger, Roger!" cried a small figure, in whom the Italian maiden\r\npredominated.\r\n\r\n"What, Aunt Geoffrey masquerading too? How d\'ye do, aunt?"\r\n\r\n"Well done, Roger! That\'s right! Go on!" cried his father, laughing\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\n"Is it not my aunt? No? Is it the little Bee, then? Why you are grown as\r\nlike her! But where is Aunt Geoffrey then? Not here? That is a bore. I\r\nthought you would have all been in port here at Christmas. And is not\r\nthis Philip? Come tell me, some of you, instead of laughing there. Are\r\nyou Fred Langford, then?"\r\n\r\n"Right this time," said Fred, "so now you must shake hands with me in my\r\nown name."\r\n\r\n"Very glad to do so, and see you here at last," said Roger, cordially.\r\n"And now tell me, what is all this about? One would think you were\r\ncrossing the Line?"\r\n\r\n"You shall hear what it is all about, and see too," said Mr. Langford.\r\n"We must have that wicked old Jew disappointed, must not we, Willy? But\r\nwhere is my little Portia? What is become of her?"\r\n\r\n"Fled, I suspect," said her mother, "gone to turn into herself before\r\nher introduction."\r\n\r\n"O, Roger, it was so jolly," Carey was now heard to say above the\r\nconfusion of voices. "Uncle Geoffrey was an old Jew, going to cut a\r\npound of flesh out of Fred, and Henrietta was making a speech in a\r\nlawyer\'s wig, and had just found such a dodge!"\r\n\r\n"Ha! like the masks in the carnival at Rio! Ferrars and I went ashore\r\nthere, and--"\r\n\r\n"Have you been at Sutton Leigh, Roger?"\r\n\r\n"Have you dined?"\r\n\r\n"Cold turkey--excellent Christmas pie, only too much pepper--a cup of\r\ntea--no, but we will have the beef in--"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was suspended by these propositions, with the\r\nanswers and thanks resulting therefrom, but in the midst grandpapa\r\nexclaimed, "Ah! here she is! Here is the counsellor! Here is a new\r\ncousin for you, Roger; here is the advocate for you when you have a\r\ntough law-suit! Lucky for you, Master Geoffrey, that she is not a man,\r\nor your nose would soon be put out of joint. You little rogue! How dared\r\nyou make your mother and grandfather cry their hearts out?"\r\n\r\n"I was very glad to see you as bad as myself, sir," said Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford. "I was very much ashamed of being so foolish, but then, you\r\nknow, I could hardly ever read through that scene without crying."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you are a prudent mamma, and will not let her be conceited. But\r\nto see Geoffrey, with his lips quivering, and yet frowning and looking\r\nsavage with all his might and main! Well, you are a capital set of\r\nactors, all of you, and we must see the end of it."\r\n\r\nThis was the great desire of Beatrice, and she was annoyed with\r\nHenrietta for having thrown aside her borrowed garments, but the Fates\r\ndecreed otherwise. The Christmas pie came in, grandpapa proceeded to\r\ncarve it, and soon lost the remembrance of the charade in talking to\r\nhis eldest grandson about his travels. A sailor just returned from\r\nfour years on the South American coast, who had doubled Cape Horn, shot\r\ncondors on the Andes, caught goats at Juan Fernandez, fished for sharks\r\nin the Atlantic, and heard parrots chatter in the Brazilian woods, could\r\nnot fail to be very entertaining, even though he cared not for the Incas\r\nof Peru, and could tell little about the beauties of an iceberg; and\r\naccordingly everyone was greatly entertained, except the Queen Bee, who\r\nsat in a corner of the sofa, playing with her watch-chain, wondering\r\nhow long Roger would go on eating pie, looking at the time-piece, and\r\nstrangling the yawns induced by her inability to attract the notice of\r\neither of her squires, whose eyes and ears were all for the newcomer.\r\nShe was not even missed; if she had been, it would have been some\r\nconsolation; but on they went, listening and laughing, as if the course\r\nof the Euphrosyne, her quick sailing, and the adventures of her crew,\r\nwere the only subjects of interest in the world. He was only at home for\r\na week, but so much the worse, that would be till the end of Beatrice\'s\r\nown visit, and she supposed it would be nothing but Euphrosyne the whole\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThere was at last a change: Roger had half a hundred questions to ask\r\nabout his cousins and all the neighbours.\r\n\r\n"And has Philip Carey set up for himself at Allonfield? Does he get any\r\npractice? I have a great mind to be ill; it would be such a joke to be\r\ndoctored by Master Philip!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! to think of your taking Mr. Frederick for poor Philip," said\r\nJessie. "I assure you," nodding to Fred, "I take it as a great\r\ncompliment, and so will Philip."\r\n\r\n"And is Fanny Evans as pretty as ever?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! grown quite fat and coarse," said Jessie; "but you may judge\r\nfor yourself on Monday. Dear Mrs. Langford is so kind as to give us a\r\nregular Christmas party, and all the Evanses and Dittons are coming. And\r\nwe are to dance in the dining-room, the best place for it in the\r\ncounty; the floor is so much better laid down than in the Allonfield\r\nassembly-room."\r\n\r\n"No such good place for dancing as the deck of a frigate," said Roger.\r\n"This time last year we had a ball on board the Euphrosyne at Rio. I\r\ntook the prettiest girl there in to supper--don\'t be jealous, Jessie,\r\nshe had not such cheeks as yours. She was better off there than in the\r\nnext ball where I met her, in the town. She fancied she had got rather\r\na thick sandwich at supper: she peeped in, and what do you think she\r\nfound? A great monster of a cockroach, twice as big as any you ever\r\nsaw."\r\n\r\n"O, you horrid creature!" cried Jessie, "I am sure it was your doing.\r\nI am sure it was your doing. I am sure you will give me a scorpion, or\r\nsome dreadful creature! I won\'t let you take me in to supper on Monday,\r\nI declare."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I won\'t have you. I mean to have Cousin Henrietta for my\r\npartner, if she will have me."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Cousin Roger," faltered Henrietta, blushing crimson, with\r\nthe doubt whether she was saying the right thing, and fearing Jessie\r\nmight be vexed. Her confusion was increased the next moment, as Roger,\r\nlooking at her more fully than he had done before, went on, "Much\r\nhonoured, cousin. Now, all of you wish me joy. I am safe to have the\r\nprettiest girl in the room for my partner. But how slow of them all\r\nnot to have engaged her before. Eh! Alex, what have you to say for\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\n"I hope for Queen Bee," said Alex.\r\n\r\n"And Jessie must dance with me, because I don\'t know how," said Carey.\r\n\r\n"My dears, this will never do!" interposed grandmamma. "You can\'t all\r\ndance with each other, or what is to become of the company? I never\r\nheard of such a thing. Let me see: Queen Bee must open the ball with\r\nlittle Henry Hargrave, and Roger must dance with Miss Benson."\r\n\r\n"No, no," cried Roger, "I won\'t give up my partner, ma\'am; I am a\r\nprivileged person, just come home. Knight Sutton has not had too much of\r\nHenrietta or me, so you must let us be company. Come, Cousin Henrietta,\r\nstick fast to your engagement; you can\'t break the first promise you\r\never made me. Here," proceeded he, jumping up, and holding out his hand,\r\n"let us begin this minute; I\'ll show you how we waltz with the Brazilian\r\nladies."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Cousin Roger, I cannot waltz," said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a pity. Come, Jessie, then."\r\n\r\nIf the practice of waltzing was not to be admired, there was something\r\nwhich was very nice in the perfect good humour with which Jessie\r\nanswered her cousin\'s summons, without the slightest sign of annoyance\r\nat his evident preference of Henrietta\'s newer face.\r\n\r\n"If I can\'t waltz, I can play for you," said Henrietta, willing not to\r\nseem disobliging; and going to the piano, she played whilst Roger and\r\nJessie whirled merrily round the room, every now and then receiving\r\nshocks against the furniture and minding them not the least in the\r\nworld, till at last, perfectly out of breath, they dropped laughing upon\r\nthe sofa.\r\n\r\nThe observations upon the wild spirits of sailors ashore then sank into\r\nsilence; Mrs. Roger Langford reproved her son for making such a racket,\r\nas was enough to kill his Aunt Mary; with a face of real concern he\r\napologised from the bottom of his heart, and Aunt Mary in return assured\r\nhim that she enjoyed the sight of his merriment.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma announced in her most decided tone that she would have no\r\nwaltzes and no polkas at her party. Roger assured her that there was no\r\npossibility of giving a dance without them, and Jessie seconded him as\r\nmuch as she ventured; but Mrs. Langford was unpersuadable, declaring\r\nthat she would have no such things in her house. Young people in her\r\ndays were contented to dance country dances; if they wanted anything\r\nnewer, they might have quadrilles, but as to these new romps, she would\r\nnot hear of them.\r\n\r\nAnd here, for once in her life, Beatrice was perfectly agreed with her\r\ngrandmamma, and she came to life again, and sat forward to join in the\r\nuniversal condemnation of waltzes and polkas that was going on round the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nWith this drop of consolation to her, the party broke up, and Jessie,\r\nas she walked home to Sutton Leigh, found great solace in determining\r\nwithin herself that at any rate waltzing was not half so bad as dressing\r\nup and play-acting, which she was sure her mamma would never approve.\r\n\r\nBeatrice came to her aunt\'s room, when they went upstairs, and\r\npetitioned for a little talk, and Mrs. Frederick Langford, with kind\r\npity for her present motherless condition, accepted her visit, and even\r\nallowed her to outstay Bennet, during whose operations the discussion of\r\nthe charade, and the history of the preparations and contrivances gave\r\nsubject to a very animated conversation.\r\n\r\nThen came matters of more interest. What Beatrice seemed above all\r\nto wish for, was to relieve herself by the expression of her intense\r\ndislike to the ball, and all the company, very nearly without exception,\r\nand there were few elders to whom a young damsel could talk so much\r\nwithout restraint as to Aunt Mary.\r\n\r\nThe waltzing, too, how glad she was that grandmamma had forbidden it,\r\nand here Henrietta chimed in. She had never seen waltzing before; had\r\nonly heard of it as people in their quiet homes hear and think of the\r\ndoings of the fashionable world, and in her simplicity was perfectly\r\nshocked and amazed at Jessie, a sort of relation, practising it and\r\npleading for it.\r\n\r\n"My dear!" said Beatrice, laughing, "I do not know what you would do\r\nif you were me, when there is Matilda St. Leger polka-ing away half the\r\ndays of her life."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but Lady Matilda is a regular fashionable young lady."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and so is Jessie at heart. It is the elegance, and the air, and\r\nthe society that are wanting, not the will. It is the circumstances that\r\nmake the difference, not the temper."\r\n\r\n"Quite true, Busy Bee," said her aunt, "temper may be the same in very\r\ndifferent circumstances."\r\n\r\n"But it is very curious, mamma," said Henrietta, "how people can be\r\nparticular in one point, and not in another. Now, Bee, I beg your\r\npardon, only I know you don\'t mind it, Jessie did not approve of your\r\nskating."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Beatrice, "every one has scruples of his own, and laughs at\r\nthose of other people."\r\n\r\n"Which I think ought to teach Busy Bees to be rather less stinging,"\r\nsaid Aunt Mary.\r\n\r\n"But then, mamma," said Henrietta, "we must hold to the right scruples,\r\nand what are they? I do not suppose that in reality Jessie is less--less\r\ndesirous of avoiding all that verges towards a want of propriety then we\r\nare, yet she waltzes. Now we were brought up to dislike such things."\r\n\r\n"O, it is just according to what you are brought up to," said Beatrice.\r\n"A Turkish lady despises us for showing our faces: it is just as you\r\nthink it."\r\n\r\n"No, that will not do," said Henrietta. "Something must be actually\r\nwrong. Mamma, do say what you think."\r\n\r\n"I think, my dear, that woman has been mercifully endowed with an\r\ninstinct which discerns unconsciously what is becoming or not, and\r\nwhatever at the first moment jars on that sense is unbecoming in her\r\nown individual case. The fineness of the perception may be destroyed by\r\neducation, or wilful dulling, and often on one point it may be silent,\r\nthough alive and active on others."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henrietta, as if satisfied.\r\n\r\n"And above all," said her mother, "it, like other gifts, grows\r\ndangerous, it may become affectation."\r\n\r\n"Pruding," said Beatrice, "showing openly that you like it to be\r\nobserved how prudent and proper you are."\r\n\r\n"Whereas true delicacy would shrink from showing that it is conscious\r\nof anything wrong," said Henrietta. "Wrong I do not exactly mean, but\r\nsomething on the borders of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Aunt Mary, "and above all, do not let this delicacy show\r\nitself in the carping at other people, which only exalts our own opinion\r\nof ourselves, and very soon turns into \'judging our neighbour.\'"\r\n\r\n"But there is false delicacy, aunt."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it would be false kindness to enter on a fresh discussion\r\ntonight, when you ought to be fast asleep."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen Bee, usually undisputed sovereign of Knight Sutton, found in\r\nher cousin Roger a formidable rival. As son and heir, elder brother, and\r\nnewly arrived after five years\' absence, he had considerable claims to\r\nattention, and his high spirits, sailor manners, sea stories, and bold\r\nopen temper, were in themselves such charms that it was no wonder that\r\nFrederick and Alexander were seduced from their allegiance, and even\r\ngrandpapa was less than usual the property of his granddaughter.\r\n\r\nThis, however, she might have endured, had the sailor himself been\r\namenable to her power, for his glories would then have become hers, and\r\nhave afforded her further opportunities of coquetting with Fred. But\r\nbetween Roger and her there was little in common: he was not, and never\r\nhad been, accessible to her influence; he regarded her, indeed, with all\r\nthe open-hearted affection of cousinly intercourse, but for the rest,\r\nthought her much too clever for him, and far less attractive than either\r\nHenrietta or Jessie.\r\n\r\nIf she would, Henrietta might have secured his devotion, for he was\r\nstruck with her beauty, and considered it a matter of credit to himself\r\nto engross the prettiest person present. Had Beatrice been in her place,\r\nit may be doubted how far love of power, and the pleasure of teasing,\r\nmight have carried her out of her natural character in the style that\r\nsuited him; but Henrietta was too simple, and her mind too full of her\r\nown affairs even to perceive that he distinguished her. She liked\r\nhim, but she showed none of the little airs which would have seemed to\r\nappropriate him. She was ready to be talked to, but only as she gave the\r\nattention due to any one, nay, showing, because she felt, less eagerness\r\nthan if it had been grandpapa, Queen Bee, or Fred, a talk with the last\r\nof whom was a pleasure now longed for, but never enjoyed. To his\r\nstories of adventures, or accounts of manners, she lent a willing and\r\na delighted ear; but all common-place jokes tending to flirtation fell\r\nflat; she either did not catch them, or did not catch at them. She might\r\nblush and look confused, but it was uncomfortable, and not gratified\r\nembarrassment, and if she found an answer, it was one either to change\r\nthe subject, or honestly manifest that she was not pleased.\r\n\r\nShe did not mortify Roger, who liked her all the time; and if he thought\r\nat all, only considered her as shy or grave, and still continued to\r\nadmire her, and seek her out, whenever his former favourite, Jessie,\r\nwas not in the way to rattle with in his usual style. Jessie was full of\r\nenjoyment, Henrietta was glad to be left to her own devices, her\r\nmamma was still more rejoiced to see her act so properly without\r\nself-consciousness or the necessity of interference, and the Queen Bee\r\nought to have been duly grateful to the one faithful vassal who was\r\nproof against all allurements from her side and service.\r\n\r\nShe ought, but the melancholy fact is that the devotion of womankind is\r\nusually taken as a matter of course. Beatrice would have despised and\r\nbeen very angry with Henrietta had she deserted to Roger, but she did\r\nnot feel in the least grateful for her adherence, and would have been\r\nmuch more proud of retaining either of the boys. There was one point on\r\nwhich their attention could still be commanded, namely, the charades;\r\nfor though the world may be of opinion that they had had quite a\r\nsufficiency of amusement, they were but the more stimulated by their\r\nsuccess on Thursday, and the sudden termination in the very height of\r\ntheir triumph.\r\n\r\nThey would, perhaps, have favoured the public with a repetition of\r\nShylock\'s trial the next evening, but that, to the great consternation,\r\nand, perhaps, indignation of Beatrice, when she came down to breakfast\r\nin the morning, she found their tiring-room, the study, completely\r\ncleared of all their various goods and chattels, Portia\'s wig in its\r\nbox, the three caskets gone back to the dressing-room, the duke\'s throne\r\nsafe in its place in the hall, and even Shylock\'s yellow cap picked to\r\npieces, and rolled up in the general hoard of things which were to\r\ncome of use in seven years\' time. Judith, who was putting the finishing\r\ntouches to the re-arrangement by shaking up the cushions of the great\r\nchair, and restoring the inkstand to its place in the middle of the\r\ntable, gave in answer to her exclamations the information that "Missus\r\nhad been up since seven o\'clock, helping to put away the things herself,\r\nfor she said she could not bear to have Mr. Geoffrey\'s room not fit for\r\nanybody to sit in." This might certainly be considered as a tolerably\r\nbroad hint that they had better discontinue their representations,\r\nbut they were arrived at that state of eagerness which may be best\r\nillustrated by the proverb referring to a blind horse. Every one,\r\ninclined to that same impetuosity, and want of soberness, can remember\r\nthe dismay with which hosts of such disregarded checks will recur to the\r\nmind when too late, and the poor satisfaction of the self-justification\r\nwhich truly answers that their object was not even comprehended.\r\nHenrietta, accustomed but little to heed such indications of dissent\r\nfrom her will, did not once think of her grandmamma\'s dislike, and\r\nBeatrice with her eyes fully open to it, wilfully despised it as a\r\nfidgety fancy.\r\n\r\nHenrietta had devised a series of scenes for the word assassin, and\r\ngreatly delighted the imagination of her partners by a proposal to make\r\na pair of asses\' ears of cotton velvet for the adornment of Bottom the\r\nweaver. Fred fell back in his chair in fits of laughing at the device,\r\nand Queen Bee capered and danced about the room, declaring her worthy to\r\nbe her own "primest of viziers."\r\n\r\n"And," said Beatrice, "what an exquisite interlude it will make to\r\nrelieve the various plagues of Monday evening."\r\n\r\n"Why you don\'t mean to act then!" exclaimed Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Why not? You don\'t know what a relief it will be. It will be an excuse\r\nfor getting away from all the stupidity."\r\n\r\n"To be sure it will," cried Fred. "A bright thought, Mrs. Bee. We shall\r\nhave it all to ourselves in the study in comfort."\r\n\r\n"But would grandmamma ever let us do it?" said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"I will manage," said Beatrice. "I will make grandpapa agree to it, and\r\nthen she will not mind. Think how he enjoyed it."\r\n\r\n"Before so many people!" said Henrietta. "O, Queenie, it will never do!\r\nIt would be a regular exhibition."\r\n\r\n"My dear, what nonsense!" said Beatrice. "Why, it is all among friends\r\nand neighbours."\r\n\r\n"Friends and neighbours to you," said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"And yours too. Fred, she is deserting! I thought you meant to adopt or\r\ninherit all Knight Sutton and its neighbourhood could offer."\r\n\r\n"A choice inheritance that neighbourhood, by your account," said Fred.\r\n"But come, Henrietta, you must not spoil the whole affair by such\r\nnonsense and affectation."\r\n\r\n"Affectation! O, Fred!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure it is," said Fred: "to set up such scruples as these.\r\nWhy, you said yourself that you forget all about the spectators when\r\nonce you get into the spirit of the thing."\r\n\r\n"And what is affectation," said Beatrice, seeing her advantage, "but\r\nthinking what other people will think?"\r\n\r\nThere are few persuasions to which a girl who claims to possess some\r\ndegree of sense is more accessible, than the imputation of affectation,\r\nespecially when brought forward by a brother, and enforced by a clever\r\nand determined friend. Such a feeling is no doubt often very useful in\r\npreventing folly, but it may sometimes be perverted to the smothering\r\nof wholesome scruples. Henrietta only pressed one point more, she begged\r\nnot to be Titania.\r\n\r\n"O, you must, you silly child," said Beatrice. "I have such designs\r\nfor dressing you! Besides, I mean to be Mustardseed, and make grandpapa\r\nlaugh by my by-play at the giant Ox-beef."\r\n\r\n"But consider, Bee," said Henrietta, "how much too tall I am for\r\na fairy. It would be too absurd to make Titania as large as Bottom\r\nhimself--spoil the whole picture. You might surely get some little girls\r\nto be the other fairies, and take Titania yourself."\r\n\r\n"Certainly it might conciliate people to have their own children made\r\npart of the show," said Beatrice. "Little Anna Carey has sense enough,\r\nI think; ay, and the two Nevilles, if they will not be shy. We will keep\r\nyou to come out in grand force in the last scene--Queen Eleanor sucking\r\nthe poison. Aunt Mary has a certain black-lace scarf that will make an\r\nexcellent Spanish mantilla. Or else suppose you are Berengaria, coming\r\nto see King Richard when he was \'old-man-of-the-mountains.\'"\r\n\r\n"No, no," cried Fred, "stick to the Queen Eleanor scene. We will have no\r\nmore blacking of faces. Yesterday I was too late down stairs because I\r\ncould not get the abominable stuff out of my hair."\r\n\r\n"And it would be a cruel stroke to be taken for Philip Carey again,\r\nin the gentleman\'s own presence, too," said Beatrice. "Monsieur is\r\napparemment the apothecaire de famille. Do you remember, Henrietta, the\r\nFrench governess in Miss Edgworth\'s book?"\r\n\r\n"Jessie smiled and nodded as if she was perfectly enchanted with the\r\nmistake," said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"And I do not wonder at it," said Beatrice, "the mistake, I mean. Fred\'s\r\nwhite hands there have just the look of a doctor\'s; of course Roger\r\nthought the only use of them could be to feel pulses, and Philip, for\r\nwant of something better to do, is always trying for a genteel look."\r\n\r\n"You insulting creature!" said Fred. "Just as if I tried to look\r\ngenteel."\r\n\r\n"You do, then, whether you try or not. You can\'t help it, you know, and\r\nI am very sorry for you; but you do stand and walk and hold out your\r\nhand just as Philip is always trying to do, and it is no wonder Roger\r\nthought he had succeeded in attaining his object."\r\n\r\n"But what a goose the man must be to make such absurdity his object,"\r\nsaid Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"He could not be a Carey and be otherwise," said Busy Bee. "And besides,\r\nwhat would you have him do? As to getting any practice, unless his kith\r\nand kin choose to victimise themselves philanthropically according to\r\nRoger\'s proposal, I do not see what chance he has, where everyone knows\r\nthe extent of a Carey\'s intellects; and what is left for the poor man to\r\ndo but to study the cut of his boots?"\r\n\r\n"If you say much more about it, Queenie," said Henrietta, "you will make\r\nFred dance in Bottom\'s hob-nailed shoes."\r\n\r\n"Ah! it is a melancholy business," said Beatrice; "but it cannot be\r\nhelped. Fred cannot turn into a clodhopper. But what earthquake is\r\nthis?" exclaimed she, as the front door was dashed open with such\r\nviolence as to shake the house, and the next moment Alexander rushed in,\r\nheated and almost breathless. "Rats! rats!" was his cry; "Fred, that\'s\r\nright. But where is Uncle Geoffrey?"\r\n\r\n"Gone to Allonfield."\r\n\r\n"More\'s the pity. There are a whole host of rats in the great barn at\r\nhome. Pincher caught me one just now, and they are going to turn the\r\nplace regularly out, only I got them to wait while I came up here for\r\nyou and Uncle Geoffrey. Come, make haste, fly--like smoke--while I go\r\nand tell grandpapa."\r\n\r\nOff flew Fred to make his preparation, and off to the drawing room\r\nhurried Alex to call grandpapa. He was greeted by a reproof from Mrs.\r\nLangford for shaking the house enough to bring it down, and grandpapa\r\nlaughed, thanked him, and said he hoped to be at Sutton Leigh in time\r\nfor the rat hunt, as he was engaged to drive grandmamma and Aunt Mary\r\nthither and to the Pleasance that afternoon.\r\n\r\nTwo seconds more, and Fred and Alex were speeding away together, and the\r\ngirls went up to put on their bonnets to walk and meet their elders at\r\nSutton Leigh. For once Beatrice let Henrietta be as slow as she pleased,\r\nfor she was willing to let as much of the visit as possible pass\r\nbefore they arrived there. They walked along, merrily concocting their\r\narrangements for Monday evening, until at length they came to the gates\r\nof Sutton Leigh, and already heard the shouts of triumph, the barking of\r\ndogs, and the cackle of terrified poultry, which proclaimed that the war\r\nwas at its height.\r\n\r\n"O! the glories of a rat hunt!" cried Beatrice. "Come, Henrietta, here\r\nis a safe place whence to contemplate it, and really it is a sight not\r\nto be lost."\r\n\r\nHenrietta thought not indeed when she looked over a gate leading into\r\nthe farm-yard on the side opposite to the great old barn, raised on\r\na multitude of stone posts, a short ladder reaching to the wide doors\r\nwhich were folded back so as to display the heaps of straw thrown\r\nviolently back and forward; the dogs now standing in attitudes of\r\necstatic expectation, tail straight out, head bent forward, now\r\nspringing in rapture on the prey; the boys rushing about with their\r\nhuge sticks, and coming down now and then with thundering blows, the\r\nlabourers with their white shirt sleeves and pitchforks pulling down the\r\nstraw, Uncle Roger with a portentous-looking club in the thick of the\r\nfight. On the ladder, cheering them on, stood grandpapa, holding little\r\nTom in his arms, and at the bottom, armed with small sticks, were\r\nCharlie and Arthur, consoling themselves for being turned out of the\r\nmelee, by making quite as much noise as all those who were doing real\r\nexecution, thumping unmercifully at every unfortunate dead mouse or rat\r\nthat was thrown out, and charging fiercely at the pigs, ducks, and geese\r\nthat now and then came up to inspect proceedings, and perhaps, for such\r\naccidents will occur in the best regulated families, to devour a share\r\nof the prey.\r\n\r\nBeatrice\'s first exclamation was, "O! if papa was but here!"\r\n\r\n"Nothing can go on without him, I suppose," said Henrietta. "And yet, is\r\nthis one of his great enjoyments?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, don\'t you know it is a part of the privilege of a free-born\r\nEnglishman to delight in hunting \'rats and mice and such small beer,\' as\r\nmuch or more than the grand chasse? I have not the smallest doubt that\r\nall the old cavaliers were fine old farm-loving fellows, who liked a rat\r\nhunt, and enjoyed turning out a barn with all their hearts."\r\n\r\n"There goes Fred!" cried Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Ah! capital. He takes to it by nature, you see. There--there! O what\r\na scene it is! Look how beautifully the sun comes in, making that solid\r\nsort of light on the mist of dust at the top."\r\n\r\n"And how beautifully it falls on grandpapa\'s head! I think that\r\ngrandpapa with little Tom is one of the best parts of the picture, Bee."\r\n\r\n"To be sure he is, that noble old head of his, and that beautiful gentle\r\nface; and to see him pointing, and soothing the child when he gets\r\nfrightened at the hubbub, and then enjoying the victories over the poor\r\nrats as keenly as anybody!"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Henrietta, "there is something very odd in man\'s\r\nnature; they can like to do such cruel-sounding things without being\r\ncruel! Grandpapa, or Fred, or Uncle Roger, or Alex now, they are as kind\r\nand gentle as possible: yet the delight they can take in catching and\r\nkilling--"\r\n\r\n"That is what town-people never can understand," said Beatrice, "that\r\nhunting-spirit of mankind. I hate above all things to hear it cried\r\ndown, and the nonsense that is talked about it. I only wish that those\r\npeople could have seen what I did last summer--grandpapa calling Carey,\r\nand holding the ladder for him while he put the young birds into their\r\nnest that had fallen out. And O the uproar that there was one day when\r\nDick did something cruel to a poor rabbit; it was two or three years\r\nago, and Alex and Carey set upon him and thrashed him so that they\r\nwere really punished for it, bad as it was of Dick; it was one of those\r\nbursts of generous indignation."\r\n\r\n"It is a very curious thing," said Henrietta, "the soldier spirit it\r\nmust be, I suppose--"\r\n\r\n"What are you philosophising about, young ladies?" asked Mr. Langford,\r\ncoming up as Henrietta said these last words.\r\n\r\n"Only about the spirit of the chase, grandpapa," said Beatrice, "what\r\nthe pleasure can be of the field of slaughter there."\r\n\r\n"Something mysterious, you may be sure, young ladies," said grandpapa.\r\n"I have hunted rats once or twice a year now these seventy years or\r\nmore, and I can\'t say I am tired yet. And there is Master Fred going\r\nat it, for the first time in his life, as fiercely as any of us old\r\nveterans, and he has a very good eye for a hit, I can tell you, if it is\r\nany satisfaction to you. Ha! hoigh Vixen! hoigh Carey! that\'s it--there\r\nhe goes!"\r\n\r\n"Now, grandpapa," said Beatrice, catching hold of his hand, "I want just\r\nto speak to you. Don\'t you think we might have a little charade-acting\r\non Monday to enliven the evening a little?"\r\n\r\n"Eh? what? More charades? Well, they are very pretty sport, only I think\r\nthey would astonish the natives here a little. Are we to have the end of\r\nShylock?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Beatrice, "we never condescend to repeat ourselves. We have a\r\nnew word and a beauty, and don\'t you think it will do very well?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid grandmamma will think you are going to take to private\r\ntheatricals."\r\n\r\n"Well, it won\'t be nearly such regular acting as the last," said\r\nBeatrice, "I do not think it would do to take another half-play for so\r\nmany spectators, but a scene or two mostly in dumb show would make a\r\nvery nice diversion. Only say that you consent, grandpapa."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t see any harm in it," said grandpapa, "so long as\r\ngrandmamma does not mind it. I suppose your mamma does not, Henrietta?"\r\n\r\n"O no," said Henrietta, with a certain mental reservation that she would\r\nmake her not mind it, or at any rate not gainsay it. Fred\'s calling her\r\naffected was enough to make her consent, and bring her mamma to consent\r\nto anything; for so little is it really the nature of woman to exercise\r\npower, that if she domineers, it is sure to be compensated by some\r\nsubjection in some other manner: and if Henrietta ruled her mother, she\r\nwas completely under the dominion of Fred and Beatrice. Themistocles\'\r\nwife might rule Athens, but she was governed by her son.\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation they went in, and found Aunt Roger very busy,\r\nrecommending servants to Aunt Mary, and grandmamma enforcing all she\r\nsaid. The visit soon came to an end, and they went on to the Pleasance,\r\nwhere the inspection did not prove quite as agreeable as on the\r\nfirst occasion; for grandmamma and Beatrice had very different views\r\nrespecting the appropriation of the rooms, and poor Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford was harassed and wearied by her vain attempts to accede to the\r\nwishes of both, and vex neither. Grandmamma was determined too to look\r\nover every corner, and discuss every room, and Henrietta, in despair\r\nat the fatigue her mother was obliged to go through, kept on seeking in\r\nvain for a seat for her, and having at last discovered a broken-backed\r\nkitchen chair in some of the regions below, kept diligently carrying\r\nit after her in all her peregrinations. She was constantly wishing that\r\nUncle Geoffrey would come, but in vain; and between the long talking at\r\nSutton Leigh, the wandering about the house, and the many discussions,\r\nher mamma was completely tired out, and obliged, when they came home,\r\nto confess that she had a headache. Henrietta fairly wished her safe at\r\nRocksand.\r\n\r\nWhile Henrietta was attending her mother to her own room, and persuading\r\nher to lay up for the evening, Beatrice, whose head was full of but one\r\nmatter, pursued Mrs. Langford into the study, and propounded her grand\r\nobject. As she fully expected, she met with a flat refusal, and sitting\r\ndown in her arm-chair, Mrs. Langford very earnestly began with "Now\r\nlisten to me, my dear child," and proceeded with a long story of\r\ncertain private theatricals some forty years ago, which to her certain\r\nknowledge, ended in a young lady eloping with a music master. Beatrice\r\nset to work to argue: in the first place it was not probable that either\r\nshe or Henrietta would run away with their cousins; secondly, that the\r\nformer elopement was not chargeable on poor Shakespeare; thirdly, that\r\nthese were not private theatricals at all.\r\n\r\n"And pray what are they, then--when you dress yourselves up, and speak\r\nthe speeches out as boldly as Mrs. Siddons, or any of them?"\r\n\r\n"You pay us a great compliment," said Beatrice, who could sometimes\r\nbe pert when alone with grandmamma; and she then went on with her\r\nexplanation of how very far this was from anything that could be called\r\ntheatrical; it was the guessing the word, not their acting, that was\r\nthe important point. The distinction was too fine for grandmamma; it\r\nwas play-acting, and that was enough for her, and she would not have it\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n"But grandpapa liked it, and had given full consent." This was a\r\npowerful piece of ordnance which Beatrice had kept in reserve, but at\r\nthe first moment the shot did not tell.\r\n\r\n"Ladies were the best judges in such a case as this," said Mrs.\r\nLangford, "and let who would consent, she would never have her\r\ngranddaughters standing up, speaking speeches out of Shakespeare, before\r\na whole room full of company."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, grandmamma, I\'ll tell you what: to oblige you, we will not\r\nhave one single scene out of Shakespeare--not one. Won\'t that do?"\r\n\r\n"You will go to some other play-book, and that is worse," said Mrs.\r\nLangford.\r\n\r\n"No, no, we will not: we will do every bit out of our own heads, and it\r\nshall be almost all Fred and Alex; Henrietta and I will scarcely come\r\nin at all. And it will so shorten the evening, and amuse every one so\r\nnicely! and grandpapa has said we may."\r\n\r\nMrs. Langford gave a sort of sigh. "Ah, well! you always will have your\r\nown way, and I suppose you must; but I never thought to see such things\r\nin my house. In my day, young people thought no more of a scheme when\r\ntheir elders had once said, \'No.\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, only you must not say so, grandmamma. I am sure we would give it\r\nup if you did; but pray do not--we will manage very well."\r\n\r\n"And put the whole house in a mess, as you did last time; turn\r\neverything upside down. I tell you, Beatrice, I can\'t have it done. I\r\nshall want the study to put out the supper in."\r\n\r\n"We can dress in our own rooms, then," said Beatrice, "never mind that."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, if you will make merry-andrews of yourselves, and your\r\nfathers and mothers like to let you, I can\'t help it--that\'s all I have\r\nto say," said Mrs. Langford, walking out of the room; while Fred entered\r\nfrom the other side a moment after. "Victory, victory, my dear Fred!"\r\ncried Beatrice, darting to meet him in an ecstasy. "I have prevailed:\r\nyou find me in the hour of victory. The Assassin for ever! announced for\r\nMonday night, before a select audience!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you are an irresistible Queen Bee," said Fred; "why Alex has just\r\nbeen telling me ever so much that his mother told him about grandmamma\'s\r\ndislike to it. I thought the whole concern a gone \'coon, as they say in\r\nAmerica."\r\n\r\n"I got grandpapa first," said Beatrice, "and then I persuaded her;\r\nshe told me it would lead to all sorts of mischief, and gave me a long\r\nlecture which had nothing to do with it. But I found out at last\r\nthat the chief points which alarmed her were poor Shakespeare and the\r\nconfusion in the study; so by giving up those two I gained everything."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that you gave up bully Bottom?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do; but you need not resign your asses\' ears. You shall wear\r\nthem in the character of King Midas."\r\n\r\n"I think," said the ungrateful Fred, "that you might as well have given\r\nit all up together as Bottom."\r\n\r\n"No, no; just think what capabilities there are in Midas. We will\r\ndecidedly make him King of California, and I\'ll be the priestess of\r\nApollo; there is an old three-legged epergne-stand that will make a most\r\nexcellent tripod. And only think of the whispering into the reeds, \'King\r\nMidas has the ears of an ass.\' I would have made more of a fight for\r\nBottom, if that had not come into my head."\r\n\r\n"But you will have nothing to do."\r\n\r\n"That helped to conciliate. I promised we girls should appear very\r\nlittle, and for the sake of effect, I had rather Henrietta broke on the\r\nworld in all her beauty at the end. I do look forward to seeing her as\r\nQueen Eleanor; she will look so regal."\r\n\r\nFred smiled, for he delighted in his sister\'s praises. "You are a\r\nwondrous damsel, busy one," said he, "to be content to play second\r\nfiddle."\r\n\r\n"Second fiddle! As if I were not the great moving spring! Trust me, you\r\nwould never write yourself down an ass but for the Queen Bee. How shall\r\nwe ever get your ears from Allonfield? Saturday night, and only till\r\nMonday evening to do everything in!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you will do it," said Fred. "I wonder what you and Henrietta cannot\r\ndo between you! Oh, there is Uncle Geoffrey come in," he exclaimed, as\r\nhe heard the front door open.\r\n\r\n"And I must go and dress," said Beatrice, seized with a sudden haste,\r\nwhich did not speak well for the state of her conscience.\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey was in the hall, taking off his mud-bespattered gaiters.\r\n"So you are entered with the vermin, Fred," called he, as the two came\r\nout of the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"O how we wished for you, Uncle Geoffrey! but how did you hear it?"\r\n\r\n"I met Alex just now. Capital sport you must have had. Are you only just\r\ncome in?"\r\n\r\n"No, we were having a consultation about the charades," said Fred; "the\r\nhigher powers consent to our having them on Monday."\r\n\r\n"Grandmamma approving?" asked Uncle Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n"O yes," said Fred, in all honesty, "she only objected to our taking a\r\nregular scene in a play, and \'coming it as strong\' as we did the other\r\nnight; so it is to be all extemporary, and it will do famously."\r\n\r\nBeatrice, who had been waiting in the dark at the top of the stairs,\r\nlistening, was infinitely rejoiced that her project had been explained\r\nso plausibly, and yet in such perfect good faith, and she flew off to\r\ndress in high spirits. Had she mentioned it to her father, he would\r\nhave doubted, taken it as her scheme, and perhaps put a stop to it: but\r\nhearing of it from Frederick, whose pleasures were so often thwarted,\r\nwas likely to make him far more unwilling to object. For its own sake,\r\nshe knew he had no objection to the sport; it was only for that of his\r\nmother; and since he had heard of her as consenting, all was right. No,\r\ncould Beatrice actually say so to her own secret soul?\r\n\r\nShe could not; but she could smother the still small voice that checked\r\nher, in a multitude of plans, and projects, and criticisms, and airy\r\ncastles, and, above all, the pleasure of triumph and dominion, and the\r\nresolution not to yield, and the delight of leading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Our hearts and all our members, being mortified from all worldly\r\nand carnal lusts:" so speaks the collect with which we begin the new\r\nyear--such the prayer to which the lips of the young Langfords said,\r\n"Amen:" but what was its application to them? What did they do with the\r\nwicked world in their own guarded homes? There was Uncle Geoffrey, he\r\nwas in the world. It might be for him to pray for that spirit which\r\nenabled him to pass unscathed through the perils of his profession,\r\nneither tempted to grasp at the honours nor the wealth which lay in his\r\nway, unhardened and unsoured by the contact of the sin and selfishness\r\non every side. This might indeed be the world. There was Jessie Carey,\r\nwith her love of dress, and admiration, and pleasure; she should surely\r\npray that she might live less to the vanities of the world; there were\r\nothers, whose worn countenances spoke of hearts devoted to the cares of\r\nthe world; but to those fair, fresh, happy young things, early taught\r\nhow to prize vain pomp and glory, their minds as yet free from anxiety,\r\nlooking from a safe distance on the busy field of trial and temptation;\r\nwere not they truly kept from that world which they had renounced?\r\n\r\nAlas! that they did not lay to heart that the world is everywhere; that\r\nif education had placed them above being tempted by the poorer, cheaper,\r\nand more ordinary attractions, yet allurements there were for them also.\r\nA pleasure pursued with headlong vehemence because it was of their own\r\ndevising, love of rule, the spirit of rivalry, the want of submission;\r\nthese were of the world. Other temptations had not yet reached them, but\r\nif they gave way to those which assailed them in their early youth, how\r\ncould they expect to have strength to bear up against the darker and\r\nstronger ones which would meet their riper years?\r\n\r\nEven before daylight had fully found its way into Knight Sutton Hall,\r\nthere was many a note of preparation, and none clearer or louder than\r\nthose of the charade actors. Beatrice was up long before light, in the\r\nmidst of her preparations, and it was not long after, as, lamp in hand,\r\nshe whisked through the passages, Frederick\'s voice was heard demanding\r\nwhether the Busy Bee had turned into a firefly, and if the paste was\r\nmade wherewith Midas was to have his crown stuck with gold paper.\r\nZealous indeed were the workers, and heartily did old Judith wish\r\nthem anywhere else, as she drove them, their lamps, their paste, and\r\nnewspaper, from one corner of the study to the other, and at last fairly\r\nout into the hall, threatening them with what Missus would say to them.\r\nAt last grandmamma came down with a party of neat little notes in her\r\nhand, to be immediately sent off by Martin and the cart to Allonfield,\r\nand Martin came to the door leading to the kitchen regions to receive\r\nhis directions.\r\n\r\n"O how lucky!" cried Queen Bee, springing up. "The cotton velvet for the\r\nears! I\'ll write a note in a second!" Then she paused. "But I can\'t do\r\nit without Henrietta, I don\'t know how much she wants. Half a yard\r\nmust do, I suppose; but then, how to describe it? Half a yard of\r\ndonkey-coloured velvet! It will never do; I must see Henrietta first!"\r\n\r\n"Have not you heard her bell?" said Fred.\r\n\r\n"No, shall I go and knock at the door? She must be up by this time."\r\n\r\n"You had better ask Bennet," said Fred; "she sometimes gets up quietly,\r\nand dresses herself without Bennet, if mamma is asleep, because it gives\r\nher a palpitation to be disturbed in the morning."\r\n\r\nBennet was shouted for, and proved not to have been into her mistress\'s\r\nroom. The charade mania was not strong enough to make them venture upon\r\ndisturbing Mrs. Frederick Langford, and to their great vexation, Martin\r\ndeparted bearing no commission for the asinine decorations.\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour after, Henrietta made her appearance, as sorry as\r\nany one that the opportunity had been lost, more especially as mamma had\r\nbeen broad awake all the time, and the only reason she had not rung the\r\nbell was, that she was not ready for Bennet.\r\n\r\nAs usual, she was called an incorrigible dawdle, and made humble\r\nconfession of the same, offering to do all in her power to make up for\r\nthe morning\'s laziness. But what would Midas be without his ears?\r\n\r\nThe best plan that Queen Bee could devise, was, that, whilst Henrietta\r\nwas engaged with the other preparations, she should walk to Sutton Leigh\r\nwith Frederick, to despatch Alexander to Allonfield. No sooner said than\r\ndone, and off they set, but neither was this plan fated to meet with\r\nsuccess, for just as they came in sight of Sutton Leigh, they were\r\nhailed by the loud hearty voice of Roger, and beheld him at the head of\r\nfour brothers, marching off to pay his respects to his Aunt Carey, some\r\nthree miles off. Alex came to hold council at Queen Bee\'s summons, but\r\nhe could do nothing for her, for he had that morning been taken to\r\ntask for not having made a visit to Mrs. Carey, since he came home, and\r\nespecially ordered off to call upon her, before meeting her at the party\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\n"How abominably provoking!" cried Beatrice; "just as if it signified. If\r\nI had but a fairy!"\r\n\r\n"Carey!" called Alex, "here! Bee wants to send over to Allonfield: won\'t\r\nyou take Dumple and go?"\r\n\r\n"Not I," responded Carey; "I want to walk with Roger. But there\'s\r\nDumple, let her go herself."\r\n\r\n"What, ride him?" asked Beatrice, "thank you, Carey."\r\n\r\n"Fred might drive you," said Carey; "O no, poor fellow, I suppose he\r\ndoes not know how."\r\n\r\nFred coloured with anger. "I do," said he; "I have often driven our own\r\nhorses."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Beatrice, "with the coachman sitting by you, and Aunt Mary\r\nlittle guessing what you were doing."\r\n\r\n"I assure you, Queen," said Fred, very earnestly, "I do really know how\r\nto drive, and if we may have the gig, and you will trust yourself with\r\nme, I will bring you home quite safe."\r\n\r\n"I know you can have the gig," said Carey, "for papa offered it to Roger\r\nand Alex this morning; only we chose all to walk together. To think of\r\ndoubting whether to drive old Dumple!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t question," said Fred; "I only want to know if Busy Bee will go.\r\nI won\'t break your neck, I promise you."\r\n\r\nBeatrice was slightly mistrustful, and had some doubts about Aunt\r\nMary, but poor Alex did much to decide her, though intending quite the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t advise you, Bee," said he.\r\n\r\n"O, as to that," said she, pleased to see that he disliked the plan, "I\r\nhave great faith in Dumple\'s experience, and I can sit tight in a chay,\r\nas the boy said to grandpapa when he asked him if he could ride. My\r\nchief doubt is about Aunt Mary."\r\n\r\nFred\'s successful disobedience in the matter of skating had decidedly\r\nmade him less scrupulous about showing open disregard of his mother\'s\r\ndesires, and he answered in a certain superior patronizing manner, "O,\r\nyou know I only give way sometimes, because she does make herself so\r\nintensely miserable about me; but as she will be spared all that now, by\r\nknowing nothing about it, I don\'t think it need be considered."\r\n\r\nBeatrice recollected what her father had said, but eluded it the next\r\nmoment, by replying to herself, that no commands had been given in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAlex stood fumbling with the button of his great coat, looking much\r\nannoyed, and saying nothing; Roger called out to him that they could not\r\nwait all day, and he exerted himself to take Beatrice by the arm, and\r\nsay, "Bee, I wish you would not, I am sure there will be a blow up about\r\nit at home."\r\n\r\n"O, you think nobody can or may drive me but yourself, Master Alex,"\r\nsaid Beatrice, laughing. "No, no, I know very well that nobody will care\r\nwhen it is done, and there are no commands one way or the other. I love\r\nmy own neck, I assure you, Alex, and will not get that into a scrape.\r\nCome, if that will put you into a better humour, I\'ll dance with you\r\nfirst to-night." Alex turned away, muttering, "I don\'t like it--I\'d go\r\nmyself, but--Well, I shall speak to Fred."\r\n\r\nBeatrice smiled with triumph at the jealousy which she thought she had\r\nexcited, and watched to see the effect of the remonstrance.\r\n\r\n"You are sure now," said he, "that you can drive safely? Remember it\r\nwould be a tolerable piece of work if you were to damage that little\r\nBee."\r\n\r\nThis eloquent expostulation might have had some weight, if it had come\r\nfrom any one else; but Fred was too much annoyed at the superiority of\r\nhis rival to listen with any patience, and he replied rather sullenly,\r\nthat he could take as good care of her as Alex himself, and he only\r\nwished that their own horses were come from Rocksand.\r\n\r\n"Well, I have no more to say," said Alex, "only please to mind this,\r\nLangford junior, you may do just as you please with our horse, drive him\r\nto Jericho for what I care. It was for your own sake and Beatrice\'s that\r\nI spoke."\r\n\r\n"Much obliged, Langford senior," replied Fred, making himself as tall as\r\nhe could, and turning round to Carey with a very different tone, "Now,\r\nCarey, we won\'t stop you any longer, if you\'ll only just be so good as\r\nto tell your man to get out the gig."\r\n\r\nCarey did so, and Beatrice and Frederick were left alone, but not long,\r\nfor Uncle Roger presently came into the yard with Willy and Arthur\r\nrunning after him. To take possession of his horse and carriage, in\r\nhis very sight, without permission, was quite impossible, and, besides,\r\nBeatrice knew full well that her dexterity could obtain a sanction from\r\nhim which might be made to parry all blame. So tripping up to him, she\r\nexplained in a droll manner the distress in which the charade actors\r\nstood, and how the boys had said that they might have Dumple to drive\r\nto Allonfield. Good natured Uncle Roger, who did not see why Fred should\r\nnot drive as well as Alex or any of his other boys, knew little or\r\nnothing of his sister-in-law\'s fears, and would, perhaps, have taken\r\nFred\'s side of the question if he had, did exactly as she intended,\r\ndeclared them perfectly welcome to the use of Dumple, and sent Willy\r\ninto the house for the driving whip. Thus authorized, Beatrice did\r\nnot fear even her father, who was not likely to allow in words what a\r\nnonentity the authority of Uncle Roger might really be esteemed.\r\n\r\nWilly came back with a shilling in his hand, and an entreaty that he\r\nmight go with Queen Bee and Fred to buy a cannon for the little ships,\r\nof which Roger\'s return always produced a whole fleet at Sutton Leigh.\r\nHis cousins were in a triumphant temper of good nature, and willingly\r\nconsenting, he was perched between them, but for one moment Beatrice\'s\r\ncomplacency was diminished as Uncle Roger called out, "Ha! Fred take\r\ncare! What are you doing?--you\'ll be against the gate-post--don\'t bring\r\nhis head so short round. If you don\'t take more care, you\'ll certainly\r\ncome to a smash before you get home."\r\n\r\nIf honour and credit had not been concerned, both Beatrice and Frederick\r\nwould probably have been much better satisfied to have given up their\r\nbold design after this debut, but they were far too much bent on their\r\nown way to yield, and Fred\'s pride would never have allowed him to\r\nacknowledge that he felt himself unequal to the task he had so rashly\r\nundertaken. Uncle Roger, believing it to be only carelessness instead of\r\nignorance, and too much used to dangerous undertakings of his own boys\r\nto have many anxieties on their account, let them go on without further\r\nquestion, and turned off to visit his young wheat without the smallest\r\nuneasiness respecting the smash he had predicted, as he had done, by way\r\nof warning, at least twenty times before.\r\n\r\nBusy Bee was in that stage of girlhood which is very sensible on some\r\npoints, in the midst of great folly upon others, and she was quite wise\r\nenough to let Fred alone, to give full attention to his driving all the\r\nway to Allonfield. Dumple knew perfectly well what was required of him,\r\nand went on at a very steady well-behaved pace, up the hill, across the\r\ncommon, and into the town, where, leaving him at the inn, they walked\r\ninto the street, and Beatrice, after an infinity of searching, succeeded\r\nin obtaining certain grey cotton velvet, which, though Fred asserted\r\nthat donkeys had a tinge of lilac, was certainly not unfit to represent\r\ntheir colour. As Fred\'s finances were in a much more flourishing state\r\nsince New Year\'s day, he proceeded to delight the very heart of Willy\r\nby a present of a pair of little brass cannon, on which his longing eyes\r\nhad often before been fixed, and they then returned to the carriage, in\r\nsome dismay on perceiving that it was nearly one o\'clock.\r\n\r\n"We must go straight home," said Beatrice, "or this velvet will be of no\r\nuse. There is no time to drive to Sutton Leigh and walk from thence."\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, there was an influential personage who was by no\r\nmeans willing to consent to this arrangement, namely, Dumple, who,\r\nwell aware that an inexperienced hand held the reins, was privately\r\ndetermined that his nose should not be turned away from the shortest\r\nroad to his own stable.\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as he came to the turning towards Sutton Leigh, he\r\nmade a decided dash in that direction. Fred pulled him sharply, and a\r\nlittle nervously; the horse resisted; Fred gave him a cut with the\r\nwhip, but Dumple felt that he had the advantage, and replying with a\r\ndemonstration of kicking, suddenly whisked round the corner, and set\r\noff over the rough jolting road at a pace very like running away. Fred\r\npulled hard, but the horse went the faster. He stood up. "Sit still,"\r\ncried Beatrice, now speaking for the first time, "the gate will stop\r\nhim;" but ere the words were uttered, Frederick, whether by a movement\r\nof his own, or the rapid motion of the carriage, she knew not, was\r\nthrown violently to the ground; and as she was whirled on, she saw him\r\nno more. Instinct, rather than presence of mind, made her hold fast to\r\nthe carriage with one hand, and throw the other arm round little Willy,\r\nto prevent him from being thrown out, as they were shaken from side to\r\nside by the ruts and stones over which they were jolted. A few minutes\r\nmore, and their way was barred by a gate--that which she had spoken\r\nof--the horse, used to stopping there, slackened his pace, and stood\r\nstill, looking over it as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nTrembling in every limb, Beatrice stood safely on the ground, and Willy\r\nbeside her. Without speaking, she hurried back to seek for Fred, her\r\nsteps swifter than they had ever before been, though to herself it\r\nseemed as if her feet were of lead, and the very throbbing of her heart\r\ndragged her back. In every bush she fancied she saw Fred coming to meet\r\nher, but it was only for a moment, and at length she saw him but\r\ntoo plainly. He was stretched at full length on the ground,\r\nsenseless--motionless. She sank rather than knelt down beside him, and\r\ncalled him; but not a token was there that he heard her. She lifted\r\nhis hand, it fell powerless, and clasping her own, she sat in an almost\r\nunconscious state of horror, till roused by little Willy, who asked in a\r\nterrified breathless whisper,\r\n\r\n"Bee, is he dead?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," cried she, as if she could frighten away her own fears;\r\n"he is only stunned. He is--he must be alive. He will come to him-self!\r\nHelp me to lift him up--here--that is it--his head on my lap--"\r\n\r\n"O, the blood!" said Willy, recoiling in increased fear, as he saw it\r\nstreaming from one or two cuts and bruises on the side of the face.\r\n\r\n"That is not the worst," said Beatrice. "There--hold him toward the\r\nwind." She raised his head, untied his handkerchief, and hung over him;\r\nbut there was not a sound, not a breath; his head sank a dead weight\r\non her knee. She locked her hands together, and gazed wildly round for\r\nhelp; but no one all over the wide lonely common could be seen, except\r\nWilly, who stood helplessly looking at her.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Mary! O, Aunt Mary!" cried she, in a tone of the bitterest anguish\r\nof mind. "Fred--dear, dear Freddy, open your eyes, answer me! Oh, only\r\nspeak to me! O what shall I do?"\r\n\r\n"Pray to God," whispered Willy.\r\n\r\n"You--you--Willy; I can\'t--it was my doing. O, Aunt Mary!" A few moments\r\npassed in silence, then she exclaimed, "What are we doing here?\r\nWilly, you must go and call them. The Hall is nearest; go through the\r\nplantation as fast as you can. Go to papa in the study; if he is not\r\nthere, find grandpapa--any one but Aunt Mary. Mind, Willy, don\'t let her\r\nhear it, it would kill her. Go, fly! You understand--any one but Aunt\r\nMary."\r\n\r\nGreatly relieved at being sent out of sight of that senseless form,\r\nWilly required no second bidding, but rushed off at a pace which bade\r\nfare to bring him to the Hall in a very brief space. Infinite were the\r\nramifications of thought that now began to chase each other over the\r\nsurface of her mind, as she sat supporting her cousin\'s head, all clear\r\nand distinct, yet all overshadowed by that agony of suspense which\r\nmade her sit as if she was all eye and ear, watching for the slightest\r\nmotion, the faintest sound, that hope might seize as a sign of life. She\r\nwiped away the blood which was streaming from the cuts in the face, and\r\nsoftly laid her trembling hand to seek for some trace of a blow amid the\r\nfair shining hair; she felt the pulse, but she could not satisfy herself\r\nwhether it beat or not; she rubbed the cold hand between both her own,\r\nand again and again started with the hope that the long black eyelashes\r\nwere being lifted from the white cheek, or that she saw a quivering of\r\nlip or nostril. All this while her thoughts were straying miles away,\r\nand yet so wondrously and painfully present. As she thought of her Uncle\r\nFrederick, and, as it were, realized his death, which had happened so\r\nnearly in this same manner, she experienced a sort of heart-sinking\r\nwhich would almost make her believe in a fate on the family. And that\r\nFred should be cut off in the midst of an act of disobedience, and she\r\nthe cause! O thought beyond endurance! She tried to pray for him, for\r\nherself, for her aunt, but no prayer would come; and suddenly she found\r\nher mind pursuing Willy, following him through all the gates and gaps,\r\nentering the garden, opening the study door, seeing her father\'s sudden\r\nstart, hearing poor Henrietta\'s cry, devising how it would be broken to\r\nher aunt; and again, the misery of recollecting her overpowered her,\r\nand she gave a groan, the very sound of which thrilled her with the hope\r\nthat Fred was reviving, and made her, if possible, watch with double\r\nintenseness, and then utter a desponding sigh. She wished it was she who\r\nlay there, unconscious of such exceeding wretchedness, and, strange\r\nto say, her imagination began to devise all that would be said were it\r\nreally so; what all her acquaintance would say of the little Queen Bee,\r\nhow soon Matilda St. Leger would forget her, how long Henrietta would\r\ncherish the thought of her, how deeply and silently Alex would grieve.\r\n"He would be a son to papa," she thought; but then came a picture of her\r\nhome, her father and mother without their only one, and tears came into\r\nher eyes, which she brushed away, almost smiling at the absurdity of\r\ncrying for her own imagined death, instead of weeping over this but too\r\npositive and present distress.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to interrupt her; Fred lay as lifeless as before,\r\nand not a creature passed along the lonely road. The frosty air was\r\nperfectly still, and through it sounded the barking of dogs, the tinkle\r\nof the sheep-bell, the woodsman\'s axe in the plantations, and now and\r\nthen the rattle of Dumple\'s harness, as she shook his head or shifted\r\nhis feet at the gate where he had been left standing. The rooks wheeled\r\nabove her head in a clear blue sky, the little birds answering each\r\nother from the high furze-bushes, and the pee-wits came careering near\r\nher with their broad wings, floating movement, and long melancholy note\r\nlike lamentation.\r\n\r\nAt length, far away, there sounded on the hard turnpike road a horse\'s\r\ntread, coming nearer and nearer. Help was at hand! Be it who it\r\nmight, some human sympathy would be with her, and that most oppressive\r\nsolitude, which seemed to have lasted for years instead of minutes,\r\nwould be relieved. In almost an agony of nervousness lest the newcomer\r\nmight pass by, she gently laid her cousin\'s head on the grass, and flew\r\nrather than ran towards the opening of the lane. She was too late, the\r\nhorseman had passed, but she recognised the shining hat, the form of the\r\nshoulders, and with a scream almost wild in its energy, called "Philip!\r\nO, Philip Carey!"\r\n\r\nJoy, joy! he looked back, he turned his horse, and came up in amazement\r\nat finding her there, and asking questions which she could only answer\r\nby leading the way down the lane.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was off his horse, and she could almost have adored\r\nhim when she heard him pronounce that Frederick lived.\r\n\r\nA few moments passed whilst he was handling his patient, and asking\r\nquestions, when Beatrice beheld some figures advancing from the\r\nplantation. She dashed through the heath and furze to meet them, sending\r\nher voice before her with the good news, "He is alive! Philip Carey says\r\nhe is alive!" and with these words she stood before her father and her\r\nAunt Mary.\r\n\r\nHer aunt seemed neither to see nor hear her; but with a face as white\r\nand still as a marble figure, hastened on. Mr. Geoffrey Langford stopped\r\nfor an instant and looked at her with an expression such as she never\r\ncould forget. "Beatrice, my child!" he exclaimed, "you are hurt!"\r\n\r\n"No, no, papa," she cried. "It is Fred\'s blood--I am quite, quite safe!"\r\n\r\nHe held her in his arms, pressed her close to him, and kissed her brow,\r\nwith a whispered exclamation of fervent thankfulness. Beatrice could\r\nnever remember that moment without tears; the tone, the look, the\r\nembrace,--all had revealed to her the fervour of her father\'s affection,\r\nbeyond--far beyond all that she had ever imagined. It was but for one\r\ninstant that he gave way; the next, he was hastening on, and stood\r\nbeside Frederick as soon as his sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room at Knight Sutton Hall was in that state of bustle\r\nincidental to the expectation of company, which was sure to prevail\r\nwherever Mrs. Langford reigned. She walked about, removing the covers\r\nfrom chairs and ottomans, shaking out curtains, adjusting china, and\r\nappealing to Mrs. Frederick Langford in various matters of taste, though\r\nnever allowing her to move to assist her. Henrietta, however, often\r\ncame to her help, and was certainly acting in a way to incur the severe\r\ndispleasure of the absent queen, by laying aside Midas\'s robes to assist\r\nin the arrangements. "That picture is crooked, I am sure!" said Mrs.\r\nLangford; and of course she was not satisfied till she had summoned\r\nGeoffrey from the study to give his opinion, and had made him mount upon\r\na chair to settle its position. In the midst of the operation, in walked\r\nUncle Roger. "Hollo! Geoffrey, what are you up to now? So, ma\'am, you\r\nare making yourself smart to-day. Where is my father?"\r\n\r\n"He has ridden over to see the South Farm," said Mrs. Langford.\r\n\r\n"Oho! got out of the way of the beautifying,--I understand."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen anything of Fred and Busy Bee?" asked Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford. "They went out directly after breakfast to walk to Sutton\r\nLeigh, and I have not seen them since."\r\n\r\n"O yes," said Mr. Roger Langford, "I can tell you what has become of\r\nthem; they are gone to Allonfield. I have just seen them off in the gig,\r\nand Will with them, after some of their acting affairs."\r\n\r\nGood, easy man; he little thought what a thunder-clap was this\r\nintelligence. Uncle Geoffrey turned round on his elevation to look him\r\nfull in the face; every shade of colour left the countenance of Mrs.\r\nFrederick Langford; Henrietta let her work fall, and looked up in\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that Fred was driving?" said her mother.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do! Why my boys can drive long before they are that age,--surely\r\nhe knows how!"\r\n\r\n"O, Roger, what have you done!" said she faintly, as if the exclamation\r\nwould break from her in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, mamma," said Henrietta, alarmed at her paleness, "I assure\r\nyou Fred has often told me how he has driven our own horses when he was\r\nsitting up by Dawson."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, Mary," said Uncle Roger, "never fear. Depend upon it, boys\r\ndo many and many a thing that mammas never guess at, and come out with\r\nwhole bones after all."\r\n\r\nHenrietta, meantime, was attentively watching Uncle Geoffrey\'s face, in\r\nhopes of discovering what he thought of the danger; but she could learn\r\nnothing, for he kept his features as composed as possible.\r\n\r\n"I do believe those children are gone crazy about their acting," said\r\nMrs. Langford; "and how Mr. Langford can encourage them in it I cannot\r\nthink. So silly of Bee to go off in this way, when she might just as\r\nwell have sent by Martin!" And her head being pretty much engrossed with\r\nher present occupation, she went out to obey a summons from the kitchen,\r\nwithout much perception of the consternation that prevailed in the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Did you know they were going, Henrietta?" asked Uncle Geoffrey, rather\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n"No! I thought they meant to sent Alex. But O! uncle, do you think there\r\nis any danger?" exclaimed she, losing self-control in the infection of\r\nfear caught from the mute terror which she saw her mother struggling\r\nto overcome. Her mother\'s inquiring, imploring glance followed her\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n"Foolish children!" said Uncle Geoffrey, "I am very much vexed with the\r\nBee for her wilfulness about this scheme, but as for the rest, there is\r\nhardly a steadier animal than old Dumple, and he is pretty well used to\r\nyoung hands."\r\n\r\nHenrietta thought him quite satisfied, and even her mother was in some\r\ndegrees tranquillized, and would have been more so, had not Mr. Roger\r\nLangford begun to reason with her in the following style:--"Come, Mary,\r\nyou need not be in the least alarmed. It is quite nonsense in you.\r\nYou know a boy of any spirit will always be doing things that sound\r\nimprudent. I would not give a farthing for Fred if he was always to be\r\nthe mamma\'s boy you would make him. He is come to an age now when you\r\ncannot keep him up in that way, and he must get knocked about some time\r\nor other."\r\n\r\n"O yes, I know I am very foolish," said she, trying to smile.\r\n\r\n"I shall send up Elizabeth to talk to you," said Uncle Roger. "She would\r\nhave a pretty life of it if she went into such a state as you do on all\r\nsuch occasions."\r\n\r\n"Enough to break the heart of ten horses, as they say in Ireland," said\r\nUncle Geoffrey, seeing that the best chance for her was to appear at\r\nhis ease, and divert his brother\'s attention. "And by the by, Roger, you\r\nnever told me if you heard any more of your poor Irish haymakers."\r\n\r\n"Why, Geoffrey, you have an absent fit now for once in your life," said\r\nhis brother. "Are you the man to ask if I heard any more of them, when\r\nyou yourself gave me a sovereign to send them in the famine?"\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey, however, persevered, and finally succeeded in starting\r\nUncle Roger upon his favourite and inexhaustible subject of the doings\r\nat the Allonfield Union. During this time Mrs. Frederick Langford put a\r\nfew stitches into her work, found it would not do, and paused, stood\r\nup, seemed to be observing the new arrangement in the room,--then took\r\na long look out at the window, and at last left the room. Henrietta ran\r\nafter her to assure her that she was convinced that Uncle Geoffrey was\r\nnot alarmed, and to beg her to set her mind at rest. "Thank you, my\r\ndear," said she. "I--no, really--you know how foolish I am, my dear,\r\nand I think I had rather be alone. Don\'t stay here and frighten yourself\r\ntoo; this is only my usual fright, and it will be better if I am left\r\nalone. Go down, my dear, think about something else, and let me know\r\nwhen they come home."\r\n\r\nWith considerable reluctance Henrietta was obliged to obey, and\r\ndescended to the drawing-room, where the first words that met her ears\r\nwere from Uncle Roger. "Well, I wish, with all my heart, they were safe\r\nat home again. But do you mean to say, Geoffrey, that I ought not to\r\nhave let them go?"\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly come upon you for damages, if he breaks the neck of\r\nlittle Bee," said Uncle Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n"If I had guessed it," said Uncle Roger; "but then, you know, any of\r\nmy boys would think nothing of driving Dumple,--even Dick I have\r\ntrusted,--and they came up--you should have seen them--as confidently as\r\nif he had been driving four-in-hand every day of his life. Upon my word\r\nyour daughter has a tolerable spirit of her own, if she knew that he\r\ncould not drive."\r\n\r\n"A tolerable spirit of self-will," said Uncle Geoffrey, with a sigh.\r\n"But did you see them off, how did they manage?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! why there, I must confess, I was to blame," said his brother. "They\r\ndid clear out of the yard in a strange fashion, certainly, and I might\r\nhave questioned a little closer. But never mind, \'tis all straight road.\r\nI would lay any wager they will come back safe,--boys always do."\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey smiled, but Henrietta thought it a very bad sign that\r\nhe, too, looked out at the window; and the confidence founded on his\r\ntranquillity deserted her.\r\n\r\nUncle Roger forthwith returned to the fighting o\'er again of his battles\r\nat the Board of Guardians, and Henrietta was able to get to the window,\r\nwhere for some ten minutes she sat, and at length exclaimed with a\r\nstart, "Here is Willy running across the paddock!"\r\n\r\n"All right!" said Uncle Roger, "they must have stopped at Sutton Leigh!"\r\n\r\n"It is the opposite way!" said Mr. Geoffrey Langford, who at the same\r\nmoment stepped up to the window. Henrietta\'s heart throbbed fearfully as\r\nshe saw how wearied was the boy\'s running, and yet how rapid. She could\r\nhardly stand as she followed her uncles to the hall; her mother at the\r\nsame moment came downstairs, and all together met the little boy, as,\r\nbreathless, exhausted, unable to speak, he rushed into the hall, and\r\nthrew himself upon his father, leaning his head against him and clinging\r\nas if he could not stand.\r\n\r\n"Why Will, how now, my boy? Have you been racing?" said his father,\r\nkneeling on one knee, and supporting the poor little wearied fellow, as\r\nhe almost lay upon his breast and shoulder. "What is the matter now?"\r\n\r\nThere was a deep silence only interrupted by the deep pantings of\r\nthe boy. Henrietta leant on the banisters, giddy with suspense. Uncle\r\nGeoffrey stepped into the dining-room, and brought back a glass of\r\nwine and some water. Aunt Mary parted the damp hair that hung over his\r\nforehead, laid her cold hand on it, and said, "Poor little fellow."\r\n\r\nAt her voice Willy looked up, clung faster to his father, and whispered\r\nsomething unintelligible.\r\n\r\n"What? Has anything happened? What is the matter?" were questions\r\nanxiously asked, while Uncle Geoffrey in silence succeeded in\r\nadministering the wine; after which Willy managed to say, pointing to\r\nhis aunt,\r\n\r\n"Don\'t--tell--her."\r\n\r\nIt was with a sort of ghastly composure that she leant over him, saying,\r\n"Don\'t be afraid, my dear, I am ready to hear it."\r\n\r\nHe raised himself, and gazed at her in perplexity and wonder.\r\nHenrietta\'s violently throbbing heart took from her almost the\r\nperception of what was happening.\r\n\r\n"Take breath, Willy," said his father; "don\'t keep us all anxious."\r\n\r\n"Bee said I was to tell Uncle Geoffrey," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"Is she safe?" asked Aunt Mary, earnestly.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Thanks to God," said she, holding out her hand to Uncle Geoffrey,\r\nwith a look of relief and congratulation, and yet of inexpressible\r\nmournfulness which went to his heart.\r\n\r\n"And Fred?" said Uncle Roger.\r\n\r\n"Do not ask, Roger," said she, still as calmly as before; "I always knew\r\nhow it would be."\r\n\r\nHenrietta tried to exclaim, to inquire, but her lips would not frame one\r\nword, her tongue would not leave the roof of her mouth. She heard a few\r\nconfused sounds, and then a mist came over her eyes, a rushing of waters\r\nin her ears, and she sank on the ground in a fainting fit. When she came\r\nto herself she was lying on the sofa in the drawing-room, and all was\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n"Mamma!" said she.\r\n\r\n"Here, dear child,"--but it was Mrs. Langford\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Mamma!" again said she. "Where is mamma? Where are they all? Why does\r\nthe room turn round?"\r\n\r\n"You have not been well, my dear," said her grandmother; "but drink\r\nthis, and lie still, you will soon be better."\r\n\r\n"Where is mamma?" repeated Henrietta, gazing round and seeing no one but\r\nMrs. Langford and Bennet. "Was she frightened at my being ill? Tell her\r\nI am better."\r\n\r\n"She knows it, my dear: lie still and try to go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"But weren\'t there a great many people?" said Henrietta. "Were we not\r\nin the hall? Did not Willy come? O! grandmamma, grandmamma, do tell me,\r\nwhere are mamma and Fred?"\r\n\r\n"They will soon be here, I hope."\r\n\r\n"But, grandmamma," cried she vehemently, turning herself round as\r\nclearer recollection returned, "something has happened--O! what has\r\nhappened to Fred?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing very serious, we hope, my dear," said Mrs. Langford. "It was\r\nWilly who frightened you. Fred has had a fall, and your mamma and uncles\r\nare gone to see about him."\r\n\r\n"A fall! O, tell me, tell me! I am sure it is something dreadful! O,\r\ntell me all about it, grandmamma, is he much hurt? O, Freddy, Freddy!"\r\n\r\nWith more quietness than could have been anticipated from so active and\r\nbustling a nature, Mrs. Langford gradually told her granddaughter all\r\nthat she knew, which was but little, as she had been in attendance\r\non her, and had only heard the main fact of Willy\'s story. Henrietta\r\nclapped her hands wildly together in an agony of grief. "He is\r\nkilled--he is, I\'m sure of it!" said she. "Why do you not tell me so?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, I trust and believe that he is only stunned."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no! papa was killed in that way, and I am sure he is! O, Fred,\r\nFred, my own dear, dear brother, my only one! O, I cannot bear it! O,\r\nFred!"\r\n\r\nShe rose up from the sofa, and walked and down the room in an ecstasy of\r\nsorrow. "And it was I that helped to bring him here! It was my doing! O,\r\nmy own, my dearest, my twin brother, I cannot live without him!"\r\n\r\n"Henrietta," said Mrs. Langford, "you do not know what you are saying;\r\nyou must bear the will of God, be it what it may."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t, I can not," repeated Henrietta; "if I am to lose him, I can\'t\r\nlive; I don\'t care for anything without Fred!"\r\n\r\n"Your mother, Henrietta."\r\n\r\n"Mamma! O, don\'t speak of her; she would die, I am sure she would,\r\nwithout him; and then I should too, for I should have nothing."\r\n\r\nHenrietta\'s grief was the more ungovernable that it was chiefly selfish;\r\nthere was little thought of her mother,--little, indeed, for anything\r\nbut the personal loss to herself. She hid her face in her hands, and\r\nsobbed violently, though without a tear, while Mrs. Langford vainly\r\ntried to make her hear of patience and resignation, turning away, and\r\nsaying, "I can\'t be patient--no, I can\'t!" and then again repeating her\r\nbrother\'s name with all the fondest terms of endearment.\r\n\r\nThen came a sudden change: it was possible that he yet lived--and she\r\nbecame certain that he had been only stunned for a moment, and required\r\nher grandmamma to be so too. Mrs. Langford, at the risk of a cruel\r\ndisappointment, was willing to encourage her hope; but Henrietta,\r\nfancying herself treated like a petted child, chose to insist on being\r\ntold really and exactly what was her view of the case. Then she was\r\nurgent to go out and meet the others, and learn the truth; but this Mrs.\r\nLangford would not permit. It was in kindness, to spare her some fearful\r\nsight, which might shock and startle her, but Henrietta was far from\r\ntaking it so; her habitual want of submission made itself felt in spite\r\nof her usual gentleness, now that she had been thrown off her balance,\r\nand she burst into a passionate fit of weeping.\r\n\r\nIn such a dreadful interval of suspense, her conduct was, perhaps,\r\nscarcely under her own control; and it is scarcely just to mention it\r\nas a subject of blame. But, be it remembered that it was the effect of\r\na long previous selfishness and self-will; quiet, amiable selfishness;\r\ngentle, caressing self-will; but no less real, and more perilous and\r\ndeceitful. But for this, Henrietta would have thought more of her\r\nmother, prepared for her comfort, and braced herself in order to be a\r\nsupport to her; she would have remembered how terrible must be the\r\nshock to her grandmother in her old age, and how painful must be the\r\nremembrances thus excited of the former bereavement; and in the attempt\r\nto console her, the sense of her own sorrow would have been in some\r\ndegree relieved; whereas she now seemed to forget that Frederick\r\nwas anything to any one but herself. She prayed, but it was one wild\r\nrepetition of "O, give him back to me!--save his life!--let him be safe\r\nand well!" She had no room for any other entreaty; she did not call\r\nfor strength and resignation on the part of herself and her mother, for\r\nwhatever might be appointed; she did not pray that his life might be\r\ngranted only if it was for his good; she could ask nothing but that her\r\nown beloved brother might be spared to herself, and she ended her prayer\r\nas unsubdued, and therefore as miserable, as when she began it.\r\n\r\nThe first intelligence that arrived was brought by Uncle Roger and\r\nBeatrice, who, rather to their surprise, came back in the gig, and\r\ngreatly relieved their minds with the intelligence of Frederick\'s life,\r\nand of Philip Carey\'s arrival. Henrietta had sprung eagerly up on their\r\nfirst entrance, with parted lips and earnest eyes, and listened to their\r\nnarration with trembling throbbing hope, but with scarcely a word; and\r\nwhen she heard that Fred still lay senseless and motionless, she again\r\nturned away, and hid her face on the arm of the sofa, without one look\r\nat Beatrice, reckless of the pang that shot through the heart of one\r\nflesh from that trying watch over her brother. Beatrice hoped for one\r\nword, one kiss, and looked wistfully at the long veil of half uncurled\r\nringlets that floated over the crossed arms on which her forehead\r\nrested, and meantime submitted with a kind of patient indifference to\r\nher grandmother\'s caress, drank hot wine and water, sat by the fire,\r\nand finally was sent upstairs to change her dress. Too restless, too\r\nanxious, too wretched to stay there alone, longing for some interchange\r\nof sympathy,--but her mind too turbid with agitation to seek it where it\r\nwould most surely have been found,--she hastened down again. Grandmamma\r\nwas busied in giving directions for the room which was being prepared\r\nfor Fred; Uncle Roger had walked out to meet those who were conveying\r\nhim home: and Henrietta was sitting in the window, her forehead resting\r\nagainst the glass, watching intently for their arrival.\r\n\r\n"Are they coming?" asked Beatrice anxiously.\r\n\r\n"No!" was all the answer, hardly uttered, and without looking round, as\r\nif her cousin\'s entrance was perfectly indifferent to her. Beatrice went\r\nup and stood by her, looking out for a few minutes; then taking the hand\r\nthat lay in her lap, she said in an imploring whisper, "Henrietta, you\r\nforgive me?"\r\n\r\nThe hand lay limp and lifeless in hers, and Henrietta scarcely raised\r\nher face as she answered, in a low, languid, dejected voice, "Of course,\r\nBee, only I am so wretched. Don\'t talk to me."\r\n\r\nHer head sunk again, and Beatrice stepped hastily back to the fire, with\r\na more bitter feeling than she had ever known. This was no forgiveness;\r\nit was worse than anger or reproach; it was a repulse, and that when her\r\nwhole heart was yearning to relieve the pent-up oppression that almost\r\nchoked her, by weeping with her. She leant her burning forehead on the\r\ncool marble chimney-piece, and longed for her mother,--longed for her\r\nalmost as much for her papa\'s, her Aunt Mary\'s and her grandmother\'s\r\nsake, as for her own. But O! what an infinite relief would one talk with\r\nher have been! She turned toward the table, and thought of writing to\r\nher, but her hand was trembling--every pulse throbbing; she could not\r\neven sit still enough to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nAt last she saw Henrietta spring to her feet, and hastening to the\r\nwindow beheld the melancholy procession; Fred carried on a mattress by\r\nUncle Geoffrey and three of the labourers; Philip Carey walking at one\r\nside, and on the other Mrs. Frederick Langford leaning on Uncle Roger\'s\r\narm.\r\n\r\nBoth girls hurried out to meet them, but all attention was at that\r\nmoment for the patient, as he was carried in on his mattress, and\r\ndeposited for a few minutes on the large hall table. Henrietta pushed\r\nbetween her uncles, and made her way up to him, unconscious of the\r\npresence of anyone else--even of her mother--while she clasped his hand,\r\nand hanging over him looked with an agonized intensity at his motionless\r\nfeatures. The next moment she felt her mother\'s hand on her shoulder,\r\nand was forced to turn round and look into her face: the sweet mournful\r\nmeekness of which came for a moment like a soft cooling breeze upon the\r\ndry burning desert of her grief.\r\n\r\n"My poor child," said the gentle voice.\r\n\r\n"O, mamma, is--is--." She could not speak; her face was violently\r\nagitated, and the very muscles of her throat quivered.\r\n\r\n"They hope for the best, my dear," was the reply; but both Mr. Geoffrey\r\nLangford and Beatrice distinguished her own hopelessness in the\r\nintonation, and the very form of the expression: whereas Henrietta only\r\ntook in and eagerly seized the idea of comfort which it was intended\r\nto convey to her. She would have inquired more, but Mrs. Langford was\r\ntelling her mother of the arrangements she had made, and entreating her\r\nto take some rest.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am,--thank you very much indeed--you are very kind: I am\r\nvery sorry to give you so much trouble," were her answers; and simple as\r\nwere the words, there was a whole world of truth and reality in them.\r\n\r\nPreparations were now made for carrying Fred up stairs, but even at\r\nthat moment Aunt Mary was not without thought for Beatrice, who was\r\nretreating, as if she feared to be as much in her way as she had been in\r\nHenrietta\'s.\r\n\r\n"I did not see you, before, Queenie," she said, holding out her hand and\r\nkissing her, "you have gone through more than any one."\r\n\r\nA thrill of fond grateful affection brought the tears into Queen Bee\'s\r\neyes. How much there was even in the pronunciation of that pet playful\r\nname to touch her heart, and fill it to overflowing with love and\r\ncontrition. She longed to pour out her whole confession, but there was\r\nno one to attend to her--the patient occupied the whole attention of\r\nall. He was carried to his mother\'s room, placed in bed, and again\r\nexamined by young Mr. Carey, who pronounced with increased confidence\r\nthat there was no fracture, and gave considerable hopes of improvement.\r\nWhile this was passing, Henrietta sat on the upper step of the stairs,\r\nher head on her hands, scarcely moving or answering when addressed. As\r\nevening twilight began to close in, the surgeon left the room, and went\r\ndown to make his report to those who were anxiously awaiting it in the\r\ndrawing-room; and she took advantage of his exit to come to the door,\r\nand beg to be let in.\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey admitted her; and her mother, who was sitting by the\r\nbed-side, held out her hand. Henrietta came up to her, and at first\r\nstood by her, intently watching her brother; then after a time sat down\r\non a footstool, and, with her head resting on her mother\'s lap, gave\r\nherself up to a sort of quiet heavy dream, which might be called the\r\nvery luxury of grief. Uncle Geoffrey sat by the fire, watching\r\nhis sister-in-law even more anxiously than the patient, and thus a\r\nconsiderable interval passed in complete silence, only broken by the\r\ncrackling of the fire, the ticking of the watches, or some slight change\r\nof posture of one or other of the three nurses. At last the stillness\r\nwas interrupted by a little movement among the bedclothes, and with a\r\nfeeling like transport, Henrietta saw the hand, which had hitherto lain\r\nso still and helpless, stretched somewhat out, and the head turned upon\r\nthe pillow. Uncle Geoffrey stood up, and Mrs. Frederick Langford pressed\r\nher daughter\'s hand with a sort of convulsive tremor. A faint voice\r\nmurmured "Mamma!" and while a flush of trembling joy illumined her pale\r\nface, she bent over him, answering him eagerly and fondly, but he did\r\nnot seem to know her, and again repeating "Mamma," opened his eyes with\r\na vacant gaze, and tried in vain to express some complaint.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, however, he regained a partial degree of consciousness.\r\nHe knew his mother, and was continually calling to her, as if for the\r\nsake of feeling her presence, but without recognizing any other person,\r\nnot even his sister or his uncle. Henrietta stood gazing sadly upon him,\r\nwhile his mother hung over him soothing his restlessness, and answering\r\nhis half-uttered complaints, and Uncle Geoffrey was ever ready with\r\nassistance and comfort to each in turn, as it was needed, and especially\r\nsupporting his sister-in-law with that sense of protection and reliance\r\nso precious to a sinking heart.\r\n\r\nAunt Roger came up to announce that dinner was ready, and to beg that\r\nshe might stay with Fred while the rest went down. Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford only shook her head, and thanked her, saying with a painful\r\nsmile that it was impossible, but begging Uncle Geoffrey and Henrietta\r\nto go. The former complied, knowing how much alarm his absence would\r\ncreate downstairs; but Henrietta declared that she could not bear the\r\nthoughts of going down, and it was only by a positive order that he\r\nsucceeded in making her come with him. Grandpapa kissed her, and made\r\nher sit by him, and grandmamma loaded her plate with all that was best\r\non the table, but she looked at it with disgust, and leaning back in her\r\nchair, faintly begged not to be asked to eat.\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey poured out a glass of wine, and said in a tone which\r\nstartled her by its unwonted severity, "This will not do, Henrietta; I\r\ncannot allow you to add to your mamma\'s troubles by making yourself ill.\r\nI desire you will eat, as you certainly can."\r\n\r\nEvery one was taken by surprise, and perhaps Mrs. Langford might have\r\ninterfered, but for a sign from grandpapa. Henrietta, with a feeling\r\nof being cruelly treated, silently obeyed, swallowed down the wine, and\r\nhaving done so, found herself capable of making a very tolerable dinner,\r\nby which she was greatly relieved and refreshed.\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey said a few cheering words to his father and mother,\r\nand returned to Fred\'s room as soon as he could, without giving that\r\nappearance of hurry and anxiety which would have increased their alarm.\r\nHenrietta, without the same thoughtfulness, rushed rather than ran after\r\nhim, and neither of the two came down again to tea.\r\n\r\nPhilip Carey was to stay all night, and though Beatrice was of course\r\nvery glad that he should do so, yet she was much harassed by the\r\nconversation kept up with him for civility\'s sake. She had been\r\nleading a forlorn dreary life all the afternoon, busy first in helping\r\ngrandmamma to write notes to be sent to the intended guests, and\r\nafterwards, with a feeling of intense disgust, putting out of sight all\r\nthe preparations for their own self-chosen sport. She desired quiet, and\r\nyet when she found it, it was unendurable, and to talk to her father or\r\ngrandfather would be a great relief, yet the first beginning might well\r\nbe dreaded. Neither of them was forthcoming, and now in the evening to\r\nhear the quiet grave discussion of Allonfield gossip was excessively\r\nharassing and irritating. No one spoke for their own pleasure, the\r\nthoughts of all were elsewhere, and they only talked thus for the sake\r\nof politeness; but she gave them no credit for this, and felt fretted\r\nand wearied beyond bearing. Even this, however, was better than when\r\nthey did return to the engrossing thought, and spoke of the accident,\r\nrequiring of her a more exact and particular account of it. She hurried\r\nover it. Grandmamma praised her, and each word was a sting.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear," said Mrs. Roger Langford, "what could have made you so\r\nanxious to go to Allonfield?"\r\n\r\n"O, Aunt Roger, it was very--" but here Beatrice, whose agitated spirits\r\nmade her particularly accessible to momentary emotion, was seized with\r\nsuch a sense of the absurdity of undertaking so foolish an expedition,\r\nwith no other purpose than going to buy a pair of ass\'s ears, that she\r\nwas overpowered by a violent fit of laughing. Grandmamma and Aunt Roger,\r\nafter looking at her in amazement for a moment, both started up, and\r\ncame towards her with looks of alarm that set her off again still more\r\nuncontrollably. She struggled to speak, but that only made it worse, and\r\nwhen she perceived that she was supposed to be hysterical, she laughed\r\nthe more, though the laughter was positive pain. Once she for a moment\r\nsucceeded in recovering some degree of composure, but every kind\r\ndemonstration of solicitude brought on a fresh access of laughter, and\r\na certain whispering threat of calling Philip Carey was worse than all.\r\nWhen, however, Aunt Roger was actually setting off for the purpose, the\r\ndread of his coming had a salutary effect, and enabled her to make a\r\nviolent effort, by which she composed herself, and at length sat quite\r\nstill, except for the trembling, which she could not control.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma and Aunt Roger united in ordering her to bed, but she could\r\nnot bear to go without seeing her papa, nor would she accept Mrs.\r\nLangford\'s offer of calling him; and at last a compromise was made that\r\nshe should go up to bed on condition that her papa should come and visit\r\nher when he came out of Fred\'s room. Her grandmamma came up with her,\r\nhelped her to undress, gave her the unwonted indulgence of a fire, and\r\nsummoned Judith to prepare things as quickly and quietly as possible\r\nfor Henrietta, who was to sleep with her that night. It was with\r\nmuch difficulty that she could avoid making a promise to go to bed\r\nimmediately, and not to get up to breakfast. At last, with a very\r\naffectionate kiss, grandmamma left her to brush her hair, an operation\r\nwhich she resolved to lengthen out until her papa\'s visit.\r\n\r\nIt was long before he came, but at last his step was heard along the\r\npassage, his knock was at her door. She flew to it, and stood before\r\nhim, her large black eyes looking larger, brighter, blacker than usual\r\nfrom the contrast with the pale or rather sallow face, and the white\r\nnightcap and dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n"How is Fred?" asked she as well as her parched tongue would allow her\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n"Much the same, only talking a little more. But why are you up still?\r\nYour grandmamma said--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, papa," interrupted she, "only tell me this--is Fred in\r\ndanger?"\r\n\r\n"You have heard all we can tell, my dear--"\r\n\r\nBeatrice interrupted him by an impatient, despairing look, and clasped\r\nher hands: "I know--I know; but what do you think?"\r\n\r\n"My own impression is," said her father, in a calm, kind, yet almost\r\nreproving tone, as if to warn her to repress her agitation, "that there\r\nis no reason to give up hope, although it is impossible yet to ascertain\r\nthe extent of the injury."\r\n\r\nBeatrice retreated a step or two: she stood by the table, one hand upon\r\nit, as if for support, yet her figure quite erect, her eyes fixed on his\r\nface, and her voice firm, though husky, as she said, slowly and quietly,\r\n"Papa, if Fred dies, it is my doing."\r\n\r\nHis face did not express surprise or horror--nothing but kindness and\r\ncompassion, while he answered, "My poor girl, I was afraid how it might\r\nhave been." Then he led her to a chair and sat down by her side, so\r\nas to let her perceive that he was ready to listen, and would give her\r\ntime. He might be in haste, but it was no time to show it.\r\n\r\nShe now spoke with more hurry and agitation, "Yes, yes, papa, it was the\r\nvery thing you warned me against--I mean--I mean--the being set in my\r\nown way, and liking to tease the boys. O if I could but speak to tell\r\nyou all, but it seems like a weight here choking me," and she touched\r\nher throat. "I can\'t get it out in words! O!" Poor Beatrice even groaned\r\naloud with oppression.\r\n\r\n"Do not try to express it," said her father: "at least, it is not I who\r\ncan give you the best comfort. Here"--and he took up a Prayer Book.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I feel as if I could turn there now I have told you, papa," said\r\nBeatrice; "but when I could not get at you, everything seemed dried up\r\nin me. Not one prayer or confession would come;--but now, O! now you\r\nknow it, and--and--I feel as if He would not turn away His face. Do you\r\nknow I did try the 51st Psalm, but it would not do, not even \'deliver me\r\nfrom blood-guiltiness,\' it would only make me shudder! O, papa, it was\r\ndreadful!"\r\n\r\nHer father\'s answer was to draw her down on her knees by his side, and\r\nread a few verses of that very Psalm, and a few clauses of the prayer\r\nfor persons troubled in mind, and he ended with the Lord\'s Prayer.\r\nBeatrice, when it was over, leant her head against him, and did not\r\nspeak, nor weep, but she seemed refreshed and relieved. He watched her\r\nanxiously and affectionately, doubting whether it was right to bestow so\r\nmuch time on her exclusively, yet unwilling to leave her. When she again\r\nspoke, it was in a lower, more subdued, and softer voice, "Aunt Mary\r\nwill forgive me, I know; you will tell her, papa, and then it will\r\nnot be quite so bad! Now I can pray that he may be saved--O,\r\npapa--disobedient, and I the cause; how could I ever bear the thought?"\r\n\r\n"You can only pray," replied her father.\r\n\r\n"Now that I can once more," said Beatrice; and again there was a\r\nsilence, while she stood thinking deeply, but contrary to her usual\r\nhabit, not speaking, and he knowing well her tendency to lose her\r\nrepentant feelings by expressing them, was not willing to interrupt her.\r\nSo they remained for nearly ten minutes, until at last he thought it\r\ntime to leave her, and made some movement as if to do so. Then she\r\nspoke, "Only tell me one thing, papa. Do you think Aunt Mary has any\r\nhope? There was something--something death-like in her face. Does she\r\nhope?"\r\n\r\nMr. Geoffrey Langford shook his head. "Not yet," said he. "I think it\r\nmay be better after this first night is over. She is evidently reckoning\r\nthe hours, and I think she has a kind of morbid expectation that it\r\nwill be as it was with his father, who lived twelve hours after his\r\naccident."\r\n\r\n"But surely, surely," said Beatrice eagerly, "this is a very different\r\ncase; Fred has spoken so much more than my uncle did; and Philip says he\r\nis convinced that there is no fracture--"\r\n\r\n"It is a morbid feeling," said Mr. Geoffrey Langford, "and therefore\r\nimpossible to be reasoned away. I see she dreads to be told to hope, and\r\nI shall not even attempt it till these fatal twelve hours are over."\r\n\r\n"Poor dear aunt!" sighed Beatrice. "I am glad, if it was to be, that you\r\nwere here, for nobody else would understand her."\r\n\r\n"Understand her!" said he, with something of a smile. "No, Bee,\r\nsuch sorrow as hers has a sacredness in it which is not what can be\r\nunderstood."\r\n\r\nBeatrice sighed, and then with a look as if she saw a ray of comfort,\r\nsaid, "I suppose mamma will soon be here?"\r\n\r\n"I think not," said her father, "I shall tell her she had better wait\r\nto see how things go on, and keep herself in reserve. At present it is\r\nneedlessly tormenting your aunt to ask her to leave Fred for a moment,\r\nand I do not think she has even the power to rest. While this goes on,\r\nI am of more use in attending to him than your mamma could be; but if\r\nhe is a long time recovering, it will be a great advantage to have her\r\ncoming fresh, and not half knocked up with previous attendance."\r\n\r\n"But how she will wish to be here!" exclaimed Beatrice, "and how you\r\nwill want her!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt of that, Queenie," said her father smiling, "but we must\r\nreserve our forces, and I think she will be of the same mind. Well, I\r\nmust go. Where is Henrietta to sleep to-night?"\r\n\r\n"With me," said Beatrice.\r\n\r\n"I will send her to you as soon as I can. You must do what you can with\r\nher, Bee, for I can see that the way she hangs on her mamma is quite\r\noppressive. If she had but a little vigour!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to do about her!" said Beatrice with more dejection\r\nthan she had yet shown, "I wish I could be of any comfort to her, but I\r\ncan\'t--I shall never do good to anybody--only harm."\r\n\r\n"Fear the harm, and the good will come," said Mr. Geoffrey Langford.\r\n"Good night, my dear."\r\n\r\nBeatrice threw herself on her knees as soon as the door had closed on\r\nher father, and so remained for a considerable time in one earnest,\r\nunexpressed outpouring of confession and prayer, for how long she knew\r\nnot, all that she was sensible of was a feeling of relief, the repose of\r\nsuch humility and submission, such heartfelt contrition as she had never\r\nknown before.\r\n\r\nSo she continued till she heard Henrietta\'s approaching steps, when she\r\nrose and opened the door, ready to welcome her with all the affection\r\nand consolation in her power. There stood Henrietta, a heavy weight on\r\nher eyes, her hair on one side all uncurled and flattened, the colour\r\non half her face much deepened, and a sort of stupor about her whole\r\nperson, as if but one idea possessed her. Beatrice went up to meet her,\r\nand took her candle, asking what account she brought of the patient. "No\r\nbetter," was all the answer, and she sat down making no more detailed\r\nanswers to all her cousin\'s questions. She would have done the same to\r\nher grandmamma, or any one else, so wrapped up was she in her own grief,\r\nbut this conduct gave more pain to Beatrice than it could have done\r\nto any one else, since it kept up the last miserable feeling of being\r\nunforgiven. Beatrice let her sit still for some minutes, looking at\r\nher all the time with an almost piteous glance of entreaty, of which\r\nHenrietta was perfectly unconscious, and then began to beg her to\r\nundress, seconding the proposal by beginning to unfasten her dress.\r\n\r\nHenrietta moved pettishly, as if provoked at being disturbed.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, dear Henrietta," said Beatrice; "if you would but\r\nlet me! You will be ill to-morrow, and that would be worse still."\r\n\r\n"No, I shan\'t," said Henrietta shortly, "never mind me."\r\n\r\n"But I must, dear Henrietta. If you would but--"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t go to bed," replied Henrietta, "thank you, Bee, never mind--"\r\n\r\nBeatrice stood still, much distressed at her own inability to be of any\r\nservice, and pained far more by the sight of Henrietta\'s grief than by\r\nthe unkind rejection of herself. "Papa thinks there is great hope," said\r\nshe abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Mamma does not," said Henrietta, edging away from her cousin as if to\r\nput an end to the subject.\r\n\r\nBeatrice almost wrung her hands. O this wilfulness of grief, how hard\r\nit was to contend with it! At last there was a knock at the door--it was\r\ngrandmamma, suspecting that they were still up. Little recked Beatrice\r\nof the scolding that fell on herself for not having been in bed hours\r\nago; she was only rejoiced at the determination that swept away all\r\nHenrietta\'s feeble opposition. The bell was rung, Bennet was summoned,\r\ngrandmamma peremptorily ordered her to be undressed, and in another\r\nhalf-hour the cousins were lying side by side, Henrietta\'s lethargy\r\nhad become a heavy sleep, Beatrice was broad awake, listening to every\r\nsound, forming every possible speculation on the future, and to her own\r\noverstretched fancy seeming actually to feel the thoughts chasing each\r\nother through her throbbing head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Half-past one," said Mr. Geoffrey Langford, as if it was a mere casual\r\nobservation, though in reality it was the announcement that the fatal\r\ntwelve hours had passed more than half-an-hour since.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, but he heard a slight movement, and though\r\ncarefully avoiding any attempt to penetrate the darkness around the sick\r\nbed, he knew full well that his sister was on her knees, and when he\r\nagain heard her voice in reply to some rambling speech of her son, it\r\nhad a tremulous tone, very unlike its former settled hopelessness.\r\n\r\nAgain, when Philip Carey paid his morning visit, she studied the\r\nexpression of his face with anxious, inquiring, almost hopeful eyes, the\r\ncrushed heart-broken indifference of yesterday had passed away; and when\r\nthe expedience of obtaining further advice was hinted at, she caught\r\nat the suggestion with great eagerness, though the day before her only\r\nanswer had been, "As you think right." She spoke so as to show the\r\ngreatest consideration for the feelings of Philip Carey, then with\r\nher usual confiding spirit, she left the selection of the person to\r\nbe called in entirely to him, to her brother and father-in-law, and\r\nreturned to her station by Frederick, who had already missed and\r\nsummoned her.\r\n\r\nPhilip, in spite of the small follies which provoked Beatrice\'s sarcasm,\r\nwas by no means deficient in good sense or ability; his education had\r\nowed much to the counsels of Mr. Geoffrey Langford, whom he regarded\r\nwith great reverence, and he was so conscious of his own inexperience\r\nand diffident of his own opinion, as to be very anxious for assistance\r\nin this, the first very serious case which had fallen under his own\r\nmanagement. The proposal had come at first from himself, and this was a\r\ncause of great rejoicing to those who had to reconcile Mrs. Langford to\r\nthe measure. In her eyes a doctor was a doctor, member of a privileged\r\nfraternity in which she saw no distinctions, and to send for advice\r\nfrom London would, she thought, not only hurt the feelings of Mrs.\r\nRoger Langford, and all the Carey connection, but seriously injure the\r\nreputation of young Mr. Carey in his own neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nGrandpapa answered, and Beatrice was glad he did so, that such\r\nconsiderations were as nothing when weighed in the scale against\r\nFrederick\'s life; she was silenced, but unconvinced, and unhappy till\r\nher son Geoffrey, coming down late to breakfast, greatly comforted\r\nher by letting her make him some fresh toast with her own hands, and\r\npersuading her that it would be greatly in favour of Philip\'s practice\r\nthat his opinion should be confirmed by an authority of note.\r\n\r\nThe electric telegraph and the railroad brought the surgeon even before\r\nshe had begun seriously to expect him, and his opinion was completely\r\nsatisfactory as far as regarded Philip Carey and the measures already\r\ntaken; Uncle Geoffrey himself feeling convinced that his approval was\r\ngenuine, and not merely assumed for courtesy\'s sake. He gave them, too,\r\nmore confident hope of the patient than Philip, in his diffidence, had\r\nventured to do, saying that though there certainly was concussion of the\r\nbrain, he thought there was great probability that the patient would do\r\nwell, provided that they could combat the feverish symptoms which had\r\nbegun to appear. He consulted with Philip Carey, the future treatment\r\nwas agreed upon, and he left them with cheered and renewed spirits to\r\nenter on a long and anxious course of attendance. Roger, who was obliged\r\nto go away the next day, cheered up his brother Alex into a certainty\r\nthat Fred would be about again in a week, and though no one but the boys\r\nshared the belief, yet the assurances of any one so sanguine, inspired\r\nthem all with something like hope.\r\n\r\nThe attendance at first fell almost entirely on Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford and Uncle Geoffrey, for the patient, who had now recovered a\r\nconsiderable degree of consciousness, would endure no one else. If his\r\nmother\'s voice did not answer him the first moment, he instantly grew\r\nrestless and uneasy, and the plaintive inquiry, "Is Uncle Geoffrey\r\nhere?" was many times repeated. He would recognise Henrietta, but his\r\nusual answer to her was "You speak so loud;" though in reality, her tone\r\nwas almost exactly the same as her mother\'s; and above all others he\r\ndisliked the presence of Philip Carey.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" inquired he, the first time that he was at all conscious\r\nof the visits of other people: and when his mother explained, he asked\r\nquickly, "Is he gone?"\r\n\r\nThe next day, Fred was alive to all that was going on, but suffering\r\nconsiderable pain, and with every sense quickened to the most acute and\r\ndistressing degree, his eyes dazzled by light which, as he declared,\r\nglanced upon the picture frames in a room where his mother and uncle\r\ncould scarcely see to find their way, and his ears pierced, as it\r\nwere, by the slightest sound in the silent house, sleepless with\r\npain, incapable of thought, excessively irritable in temper, and his\r\nfaculties, as it seemed, restored only to be the means of suffering.\r\nMrs. Langford came to the door to announce that Philip Carey was come.\r\nMr. Geoffrey Langford went to speak to him, and grandmamma and Henrietta\r\nbegan to arrange the room a little for his reception. Fred, however,\r\nsoon stopped this. "I can\'t bear the shaking," said he. "Tell them to\r\nleave off, mamma."\r\n\r\nGrandmamma, unconscious of the pain she was inflicting, and believing\r\nthat she made not the slightest noise, continued to put the chairs\r\nin order, but Fred gave an impatient, melancholy sort of groan and\r\nexclamation, and Mrs. Langford remarked, "Well, if he cannot bear it, it\r\ncannot be helped; but it is quite dangerous in this dark room!" And out\r\nshe went, Fred frowning with pain at every step she took.\r\n\r\n"Why do you let people come?" asked he sharply of his mother. "Where is\r\nUncle Geoffrey gone?"\r\n\r\n"He is speaking with Mr. Philip Carey, my dear, he will be here with him\r\ndirectly."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want Philip Carey; don\'t let him come."\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, he must come; he has not seen you to-day, perhaps he may\r\ndo something for this sad pain."\r\n\r\nFred turned away impatiently, and at the same moment Uncle Geoffrey\r\nopened the door to ask if Fred was ready.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Frederick Langford: and Philip entered. But Fred would\r\nnot turn towards him till desired to do so, nor give his hand readily\r\nfor his pulse to be felt. Philip thought it necessary to see his face\r\na little more distinctly, and begged his pardon for having the window\r\nshutters partly opened; but Fred contrived completely to frustrate his\r\nintention, as with an exclamation which had in it as much of anger as of\r\npain, he turned his face inwards to the pillow, and drew the bed-clothes\r\nover it.\r\n\r\n"My dear boy," said his mother, pleadingly, "for one moment only!"\r\n\r\n"I told you I could not bear the light," was all the reply.\r\n\r\n"If you would but oblige me for a few seconds," said Philip.\r\n\r\n"Fred!" said his uncle gravely; and Fred made a slight demonstration as\r\nif to obey, but at the first glimpse of the dim light, he hid his face\r\nagain, saying, "I can\'t;" and Philip gave up the attempt, closed the\r\nshutter, unfortunately not quite as noiselessly as Uncle Geoffrey had\r\nopened it, and proceeded to ask sundry questions; to which the patient\r\nscarcely vouchsafed a short and pettish reply. When at last he quitted\r\nthe room, and was followed by Mrs. Frederick Langford, a "Don\'t go,\r\nmamma," was immediately heard.\r\n\r\n"You must spare me for a very little while, my dear," said she, gently\r\nbut steadily.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stay long, then," replied he.\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey came up to his bedside, and with a touch soft and light\r\nas a woman\'s, arranged the coverings disturbed by his restlessness,\r\nand for a few moments succeeded in tranquillizing him, but almost\r\nimmediately he renewed his entreaties that his mother would return, and\r\nhad it been any other than his uncle who had taken her place, would have\r\ngrumbled at his not going to call her. On her return, she was greeted\r\nwith a discontented murmur. "What an immense time you have stayed\r\naway!"--presently after, "I wish you would not have that Carey!" and\r\nthen, "I wish we were at Rocksand,--I wish Mr. Clarke were here."\r\n\r\nPatience in illness is a quality so frequently described in books as\r\nwell as actually found in real life, that we are apt to believe that it\r\ncomes as a matter of course, and without previous training, particularly\r\nin the young, and that peevishness is especially reserved for the\r\nold and querulous, who are to try the amiability of the heroine. To\r\na certain degree, this is often the case; the complete prostration of\r\nstrength, and the dim awe of approaching death in the acute illnesses\r\nof the young, often tame down the stubborn or petulant temper, and their\r\npatience and forbearance become the wonder and admiration of those who\r\nhave seen germs of far other dispositions. And when this is not the\r\ncase, who would have the heart to complain? Certainly not those who\r\nare like the mother and uncle who had most to endure from the exacting\r\nhumours of Frederick Langford. High spirits, excellent health, a certain\r\ndegree of gentleness of character, and a home where, though he was not\r\nover indulged, there was little to ruffle him, all had hitherto combined\r\nto make him appear one of the most amiable good-tempered boys that ever\r\nexisted; but there was no substance in this apparent good quality, it\r\nwas founded on no real principle of obedience or submission, and when to\r\nan habitual spirit of determination to have his own way, was superadded\r\nthe irritability of nerves which was a part of his illness, when his\r\npowers of reflection were too much weakened to endure or comprehend\r\nargument; when, in fact, nothing was left to fall back upon but the\r\nsimple obedience which would have been required in a child, and when\r\nthat obedience was wanting, what could result but increased discomfort\r\nto himself and all concerned? Yes, even as we should lay up a store of\r\nprayers against that time when we shall be unable to pray for ourselves,\r\nso surely should we lay up a store of habits against the time when we\r\nmay be unable to think or reason for ourselves! How often have\r\nlives been saved by the mere instinct of unquestioning instantaneous\r\nobedience!\r\n\r\nHad Frederick possessed that instinct, how much present suffering and\r\nfuture wretchedness might have been spared him! His ideas were as yet\r\ntoo disconnected for him to understand or bear in mind that he was\r\nsubjecting his mother to excessive fatigue, but the habit of submission\r\nwould have led him to bear her absence patiently, instead of perpetually\r\ninterrupting even the short repose which she would now and then be\r\npersuaded to seek on the sofa. He would have spared her his perpetual,\r\nharassing complaints, not so much of the pain he suffered, as of every\r\nthing and every person who approached him, his Uncle Geoffrey being the\r\nonly person against whom he never murmured. Nor would he have rebelled\r\nagainst measures to which he was obliged to submit in the end, after\r\nhe had distressed every one and exhausted himself by his fruitless\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nIt was marvellous that the only two persons whose attendance he would\r\nendure could bear up under the fatigue. Even Uncle Geoffrey, one of\r\nthose spare wiry men, who, without much appearance of strength are\r\nnevertheless capable of such continued exertion, was beginning to\r\nlook worn and almost aged, and yet Mrs. Frederick Langford was still\r\nindefatigable, unconscious of weariness, quietly active, absorbed in\r\nthe thought of her son, and yet not so absorbed as not to be full of\r\nconsideration for all around. All looked forward with apprehension to\r\nthe time when the consequences of such continued exertion must be\r\nfelt, but in the meantime it was not in the power of any one except her\r\nbrother Geoffrey to be of any assistance to her, and her relations could\r\nonly wait and watch with such patience as they could command, for the\r\nperiod when their services might be effectual.\r\n\r\nMrs. Langford was the most visibly impatient. The hasty bustling of her\r\nvery quietest steps gave such torture to Frederick, as to excuse the\r\nupbraiding eyes which he turned on his poor perplexed mother whenever\r\nshe entered the room; and her fresh arrangements and orders always\r\ncreated a disturbance, which created such positive injury, that it was\r\nthe aim of the whole family to prevent her visits there. This was,\r\nas may be supposed, no easy task. Grandpapa\'s "You had better not, my\r\ndear," checked her for a little while, but was far from satisfying her:\r\nUncle Geoffrey, who might have had the best chance, had not time to\r\nspare for her; and no one could persuade her how impossible, nay, how\r\ndangerous it was to attempt to reason with the patient: so she blamed\r\nthe whole household for indulging his fancies, and half a dozen times\r\na day pronounced that he would be the death of his mother. Beatrice did\r\nthe best she could to tranquillise her; but two spirits so apt to clash\r\ndid not accord particularly well even now, though Busy Bee was too much\r\ndepressed to queen it as usual. To feel herself completely useless in\r\nthe midst of the suffering she had occasioned was a severe trial; and\r\nabove all, poor child, she longed for her mother, and the repose of\r\nconfession and parental sympathy. She saw her father only at meal times;\r\nshe was anxious and uneasy at his worn looks, and even he could not be\r\nall that her mother was. Grandpapa was kind as ever, but the fault that\r\nsat so heavy on her mind was not one for discussion with any one but a\r\nmother, and this consciousness was the cause of a little reserve with\r\nhim, such as had never before existed between them.\r\n\r\nAlexander was more of a comfort to her than any one else, and that\r\nchiefly because he wanted her to be a comfort to him. All the strong\r\naffection and esteem which he really entertained for Frederick was now\r\nmanifested, and the remembrance of old rivalries and petty contentions\r\nserved but to make the reaction stronger. He kept aloof from his\r\nbrothers, and spent every moment he could at the Hall, either reading in\r\nthe library, or walking up and down the garden paths with Queen Bee. One\r\nof the many conversations which they held will serve as a specimen of\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n"So they do not think he is much better to-day?" said Alex, walking into\r\nthe library, where Beatrice was sealing some letters.\r\n\r\nBeatrice shook her head. "Every day that he is not worse is so much\r\ngained," said she.\r\n\r\n"It is very odd," meditated Alex: "I suppose the more heads have in\r\nthem, the easier it is to knock them!"\r\n\r\nBeatrice smiled. "Thick skulls are proverbial, you know, Alex."\r\n\r\n"Well, I really believe it is right. Look, Bee," and he examined his own\r\nface in the glass over the chimney; "there, do you see a little bit of\r\na scar under my eyebrow?--there! Well, that was where I was knocked over\r\nby a cricket-ball last half, pretty much harder than poor Fred\r\ncould have come against the ground,--but what harm did it do me? Why\r\neverything spun round with me for five minutes or so, and I had a black\r\neye enough to have scared you, but I was not a bit the worse otherwise.\r\nPoor Fred, he was quite frightened for me I believe; for the first thing\r\nI saw was him, looking all green and yellow, standing over me, and so I\r\ngot up and laughed at him for thinking I could care about it. That was\r\nthe worst of it! I wish I had not been always set against him. I would\r\ngive anything now."\r\n\r\n"Well, but Alex, I don\'t understand. You were very good friends at the\r\nbottom, after all; you can\'t have anything really to repent of towards\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Oh, haven\'t I though?" was the reply. "It was more the other fellows\'\r\ndoing than my own, to be sure, and yet, after all, it was worse, knowing\r\nall about him as I did; but somehow, every one, grandmamma and all of\r\nyou, had been preaching up to me all my life that cousin Fred was to be\r\nsuch a friend of mine. And then when he came to school, there he was--a\r\nfellow with a pink and white face, like a girl\'s, and that did not even\r\nknow how to shy a stone, and cried for his mamma! Well, I wish I could\r\nbegin it all over again."\r\n\r\n"But do you mean that he was really a--a--what you call a Miss Molly?"\r\n\r\n"Who said so? No, not a bit of it!" said Alex. "No one thought so in\r\nreality, though it was a good joke to put him in a rage, and pretend\r\nto think that he could not do anything. Why, it took a dozen times\r\nmore spirit for him to be first in everything than for me, who had been\r\nknocked about all my life. And he was up to anything, Bee, to anything.\r\nThe matches at foot-ball will be good for nothing now; I am sure I\r\nshan\'t care if we do win."\r\n\r\n"And the prize," said Beatrice, "the scholarship!"\r\n\r\n"I have no heart to try for it now! I would not, if Uncle Geoffrey\r\nhad not a right to expect it of me. Let me see: if Fred is well by the\r\nsummer, why then--hurrah! Really, Queenie, he might get it all up in no\r\ntime, clever fellow as he is, and be first after all. Don\'t you think\r\nso?"\r\n\r\nQueen Bee shook her head. "They say he must not read or study for a very\r\nlong time," said she.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but six months--a whole year is an immense time," said Alex. "O\r\nyes, he must, Bee! Reading does not cost him half the trouble it does\r\nother people; and his verses, they never fail--never except when he is\r\ncareless; and the sure way to prevent that is to run him up for time.\r\nThat is right. Why there!" exclaimed Alex joyfully, "I do believe\r\nthis is the very best thing for his success!" Beatrice could not help\r\nlaughing, and Alex immediately sobered down as the remembrance crossed\r\nhim, that if Fred were living a week hence, they would have great reason\r\nto be thankful.\r\n\r\n"Ah! they will all of them be sorry enough to hear of this," proceeded\r\nhe. "There was no one so much thought of by the fellows, or the masters\r\neither."\r\n\r\n"The masters, perhaps," said Beatrice; "but I thought you said there was\r\na party against him among the boys?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense! It was only a set of stupid louts who, just because they\r\nhad pudding-heads themselves, chose to say that I did better without all\r\nhis reading and Italian, and music, and stuff; and I was foolish enough\r\nto let them go on, though I knew all the time it was nothing but chaff.\r\nI shall let them all know what fools they were for their pains, as soon\r\nas I go back. Why, Queenie, you, who only know Fred at home, you have\r\nnot the slightest notion what a fellow he is. I\'ll just tell you one\r\nstory of him."\r\n\r\nAlexander forthwith proceeded to tell not one story alone, but many, to\r\nillustrate the numerous excellences which he ascribed to Fred, and again\r\nand again blaming himself for the species of division which had existed\r\nbetween them, although the fact was that he had always been the more\r\nconciliatory of the two. Little did he guess, good, simple-hearted\r\nfellow, that each word was quite as much, or more, to his credit, as to\r\nFrederick\'s; but Beatrice well appreciated them, and felt proud of him.\r\n\r\nThese talks were her chief comfort, and always served to refresh her,\r\nif only by giving her the feeling that some one wanted her, and not that\r\nthe only thing she could do for anybody was the sealing of the letters\r\nwhich her father, whose eyes were supposed to be acquiring the power of\r\nthose of cats, contrived to write in the darkness of Fred\'s room. She\r\nthought she could have borne everything excepting Henrietta\'s coldness,\r\nwhich still continued, not from intentional unkindness or unwillingness\r\nto forgive, but simply because Henrietta was too much absorbed in her\r\nown troubles to realise to herself the feelings which she wounded. Her\r\nuncle Geoffrey had succeeded in awakening her consideration for her\r\nmother; but with her and Fred it began and ended, and when outside the\r\nsick room, she seemed not to have a thought beyond a speedy return\r\nto it. She seldom or never left it, except at meal-times, or when her\r\ngrandfather insisted on her taking a walk with him, as he did almost\r\ndaily. Then he walked between her and Beatrice, trying in vain to arouse\r\nher to talk, and she, replying as shortly as possible when obliged to\r\nspeak, left her cousin to sustain the conversation.\r\n\r\nThe two girls went to church with grandpapa on the feast of the\r\nEpiphany, and strange it was to them to see again the wreaths which\r\ntheir own hands had woven, looking as bright and festal as ever, the\r\nglistening leaves unfaded, and the coral berries fresh and gay. A tear\r\nbegan to gather in Beatrice\'s eye, and Henrietta hung her head, as if\r\nshe could not bear the sight of those branches, so lately gathered by\r\nher brother. As they were leaving the church, both looked towards the\r\naltar at the wreath which Henrietta had once started to see, bearing a\r\ndeeper and more awful meaning than she had designed. Their eyes met, and\r\nthey saw that they had the same thought in their minds.\r\n\r\nWhen they were taking off their bonnets in their own room, Queen Bee\r\nstretched out a detaining hand, not in her usual commanding manner, but\r\nwith a gesture that was almost timid, saying,\r\n\r\n"Look, Henrietta, one moment, and tell me if you were not thinking of\r\nthis."\r\n\r\nAnd hastily opening the Lyra Innocentium, she pointed out the verse--\r\n\r\n\r\n"Such garland grave and fair, His church to-day adorns, And--mark it\r\nwell--e\'en there He wears His Crown of Thorns.\r\n\r\n"Should aught profane draw near, Full many a guardian spear Is set\r\naround, of power to go Deep in the reckless hand, and stay the grasping\r\nfoe."\r\n\r\n\r\n"They go very deep," sighed Henrietta, raising her eyes, with a mournful\r\ncomplaining glance.\r\n\r\nBeatrice would have said more, but when she recollected her own conduct\r\non Christmas Eve, it might well strike her that she was the "thing\r\nprofane" that had then dared to draw near; and it pained her that she\r\nhad even appeared for one moment to accuse her cousin. She was beginning\r\nto speak, but Henrietta cut her short by saying, "Yes, yes, but I can\'t\r\nstay," and was flying along the passage the next moment.\r\n\r\nBeatrice sighed heavily, and spent the next quarter of an hour in\r\nrecalling, with all the reality of self-reproach, the circumstances of\r\nher recklessness, vanity and self-will on that day. She knelt and poured\r\nout her confession, her prayer for forgiveness, and grace to avoid the\r\nvery germs of these sins for the future, before Him Who seeth in secret:\r\nand a calm energetic spirit of hope, in the midst of true repentance,\r\nbegan to dawn on her.\r\n\r\nIt was good for her, but was it not selfish in Henrietta thus to leave\r\nher alone to bear her burthen? Yes, selfish it was; for Henrietta had\r\nheard the last report of Frederick since their return, and knew that\r\nher presence in his room was quite useless; and it was only for the\r\ngratification of her own feelings that she hurried thither without even\r\nstopping to recollect that her cousin might also be unhappy, and be\r\ncomforted by talking to her.\r\n\r\nHer thought was only the repining one: "the thorns go deep!" Poor child,\r\nhad they yet gone deep enough? The patient may cry out, but the skilful\r\nsurgeon will nevertheless probe on, till he has reached the hidden\r\nsource of the malady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a soft hazy day in the beginning of February, the Knight Sutton\r\ncarriage was on the road to Allonfield, and in it sat the Busy Bee and\r\nher father, both of them speaking far less than was their wont when\r\nalone together.\r\n\r\nMr. Geoffrey Langford took off his hat, so as to let the moist spring\r\nbreeze play round his temples and in the thin locks where the silvery\r\nthreads had lately grown more perceptible, and gazed upon the dewy\r\ngrass, the tiny woodbine leaf, the silver "pussycats" on the withy, and\r\nthe tasselled catkin of the hazel, with the eyes of a man to whom such\r\nsights were a refreshment--a sort of holiday--after the many springs\r\nspent in close courts of law and London smoke; and now after his long\r\nattendance in a warm dark sick-room. His daughter sat by him, thinking\r\ndeeply, and her heart full of a longing earnestness which seemed as if\r\nit would not let her speak. She was going to meet her mother, whom she\r\nhad not seen for so long a time; but it was only to be for one evening!\r\nHer father, finding that his presence was absolutely required in London,\r\nand no longer actually indispensable at Knight Sutton, had resolved on\r\nchanging places with his wife, and she was to go with him and take her\r\nmother\'s place in attending on Lady Susan St. Leger. They were now going\r\nto fetch Mrs. Geoffrey Langford home from the Allonfield station,\r\nand they would have one evening at Knight Sutton with her, returning\r\nthemselves the next morning to Westminster.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Allonfield, executed various commissions with which Mrs.\r\nLangford had been delighted to entrust Geoffrey; they ordered some new\r\nbooks for Frederick, and called at Philip Carey\'s for some medicines;\r\nand then driving up to the station watched eagerly for the train.\r\n\r\nSoon it was there, and there at length she was; her own dear self,--the\r\ndark aquiline face, with its sweetest and brightest of all expressions;\r\nthe small youthful figure, so active, yet so quiet and elegant; the\r\ndress so plain and simple, yet with that distinguished air. How happy\r\nBeatrice was that first moment of feeling herself at her side!\r\n\r\n"My dear! my own dear child!" Then anxiously following her husband with\r\nher eye, as he went to look for her luggage, she said, "How thin he\r\nlooks, Queenie!"\r\n\r\n"O, he has been doing so much," said Busy Bee. "It is only for this\r\nlast week he has gone to bed at all, and then only on the sofa in Fred\'s\r\nroom. This is the first time he has been out, except last Sunday to\r\nChurch, and a turn or two round the garden with grandmamma."\r\n\r\nHe came back before Queen Bee had done speaking. "Come, Beatrice," said\r\nhe to his wife, "I am in great haste to have you at home; that fresh\r\nface of yours will do us all so much good."\r\n\r\n"One thing is certain," said she; "I shall send home orders that you\r\nshall be allowed no strong coffee at night, and that Busy Bee shall\r\nhide half the mountain of letters in the study. But tell me honestly,\r\nGeoffrey, are you really well?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly, except for a growing disposition to yawn," said her husband\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"Well, what are the last accounts of the patient?"\r\n\r\n"He is doing very well: the last thing I did before coming away, was to\r\nlay him down on the sofa, with Retzsch\'s outlines to look at: so you may\r\nguess that he is coming on quickly. I suppose you have brought down the\r\nbooks and prints?"\r\n\r\n"Such a pile, that I almost expected my goods would be over weight."\r\n\r\n"It is very fortunate that he has a taste for this kind of thing: only\r\ntake care, they must not be at Henrietta\'s discretion, or his own, or he\r\nwill be overwhelmed with them,--a very little oversets him, and might do\r\ngreat mischief."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think the danger of inflammation over yet, then?"\r\n\r\n"O, no! his pulse is so very easily raised, that we are obliged to keep\r\nhim very quiet, and nearly to starve him, poor fellow; and his appetite\r\nis returning so fast, that it makes it very difficult to manage him."\r\n\r\n"I should be afraid that now would be the time to see the effects of\r\npoor Mary\'s over gentleness."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but what greatly increases the difficulty is that Fred has some\r\nstrange prejudice against Philip Carey."\r\n\r\nBusy Bee, who had heard nothing of this, felt her cheeks flush, while\r\nher father proceeded.\r\n\r\n"I do not understand it at all: Philip\'s manners in a sick room are\r\nparticularly good--much better than I should have expected, and he has\r\nbeen very attentive and gentle-handed; but, from the first, Fred has\r\nshown a dislike to him, questioned all his measures, and made the most\r\nof it whenever he was obliged to give him any pain. The last time the\r\nLondon doctor was here, I am sure he hurt Fred a good deal more than\r\nPhilip has ever done, yet the boy bore it manfully, though he shrinks\r\nand exclaims the moment Philip touches him. Then he is always talking of\r\nwishing for old Clarke at Rocksand, and I give Mary infinite credit for\r\nnever having proposed to send for him. I used to think she had great\r\nfaith in the old man, but I believe it was only her mother."\r\n\r\n"Of course it was. It is only when Mary has to act alone that you really\r\nare obliged to perceive all her excellent sense and firmness; and I am\r\nvery glad that you should be convinced now and then, that in nothing\r\nbut her fears, poor thing, has she anything of the spoiling mamma about\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"As if I did not know that," said he, smiling.\r\n\r\n"And so she would not yield to this fancy? Very wise indeed. But I\r\nshould like to know the reason of this dislike on Fred\'s part. Have you\r\never asked him?"\r\n\r\n"No; he is not in a fit state for argument; and, besides, I think the\r\nprejudice would only be strengthened. We have praised Philip again and\r\nagain, before him, and said all we could think of to give him confidence\r\nin him, but nothing will do; in fact, I suspect Mr. Fred was sharp\r\nenough to discover that we were talking for a purpose. It has been the\r\ngreat trouble this whole time, though neither Mary nor I have mentioned\r\nit, for fear of annoying my mother."\r\n\r\n"Papa," said Busy Bee, "I am afraid I know the reason but too well. It\r\nwas my foolish way of talking about the Careys; I used to tease poor\r\nFred about Roger\'s having taken him for Philip, and say all sorts of\r\nthings that I did not really mean."\r\n\r\n"Hem!" said her father. "Well, I should think it might be so; it always\r\nstruck me that the prejudice must be grounded upon some absurd notion,\r\nthe memory of which had passed away, while the impression remained."\r\n\r\n"And do you think I could do anything towards removing it? You know I am\r\nto go and wish Fred good-bye this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Why, yes; you might as well try to say something cheerful, which might\r\ndo away with the impression. Not that I think it will be of any use;\r\nonly do not let him think it has been under discussion."\r\n\r\nBeatrice assented, and was silent again while they went on talking.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Mary has held out wonderfully?" said her mother.\r\n\r\n"Too wonderfully," said Mr. Geoffrey Langford, "in a way which I fear\r\nwill cost her dearly. I have been positively longing to see her give way\r\nas she ought to have done under the fatigue; and now I am afraid of\r\nthe old complaint: she puts her hand to her side now and then, and I am\r\npersuaded that she had some of those spasms a night or two ago."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said his wife, with great concern, "that is just what I have been\r\ndreading the whole time. When she consulted Dr. ----, how strongly he\r\nforbade her to use any kind of exertion. Why would you not let me come?\r\nI assure you it was all I could do to keep myself from setting off."\r\n\r\n"It was very well behaved in you, indeed, Beatrice," said he, smiling;\r\n"a sacrifice which very few husbands would have had resolution either to\r\nmake themselves, or to ask of their wives. I thanked you greatly when I\r\ndid not see you."\r\n\r\n"But why would you not have me? Do you not repent it now?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. Fred would let no one come near him but his mother\r\nand me; you could not have saved either of us an hour\'s nursing then,\r\nwhereas now you can keep Fred in order, and take care of Mary, if she\r\nwill suffer it, and that she will do better from you than from any one\r\nelse."\r\n\r\nThey were now reaching the entrance of Sutton Leigh Lane, and Queen Bee\r\nwas called upon for the full history of the accident, which, often as\r\nit had been told by letter, must again be narrated in all its branches.\r\nEven her father had never had time to hear it completely; and there was\r\nso much to ask and to answer on the merely external circumstances, that\r\nthey had not begun to enter upon feelings and thoughts when they arrived\r\nat the gate of the paddock, which was held open by Dick and Willy,\r\nexcessively delighted to see Aunt Geoffrey.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments more she was affectionately welcomed by old Mrs.\r\nLangford, whose sentiments with regard to the two Beatrices were of\r\na curiously varying and always opposite description. When her\r\ndaughter-in-law was at a distance, she secretly regarded with a kind of\r\nrespectful aversion, both her talents, her learning, and the fashionable\r\nlife to which she had been accustomed; but in her presence the winning,\r\nlively simplicity of her manners completely dispelled all these\r\nprejudices in an instant, and she loved her most cordially for her own\r\nsake, as well as because she was Geoffrey\'s wife. On the contrary, the\r\nyounger Beatrice, while absent, was the dear little granddaughter,--the\r\nQueen of Bees, the cleverest of creatures; and while present, it has\r\nalready been shown how constantly the two tempers fretted each other, or\r\nhad once done so, though now, so careful had Busy Bee lately been, there\r\nhad been only one collision between them for the last ten days, and that\r\nwas caused by her strenuous attempts to convince grandmamma that Fred\r\nwas not yet fit for boiled chicken and calves\' foot jelly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Langford\'s greetings were not half over when Henrietta and her\r\nmamma hastened down stairs to embrace dear Aunt Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n"My dear Mary, I am so glad to be come to you at last!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, O! thank you, Beatrice. How Fred will enjoy having you now!"\r\n\r\n"Is he tired?" asked Uncle Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n"No, not at all; he seems to be very comfortable. He has been talking of\r\nQueen Bee\'s promised visit. Do you like to go up now, my dear?"\r\n\r\nQueen Bee consented eagerly, though with some trepidation, for she had\r\nnot seen her cousin since his accident, and besides, she did not know\r\nhow to begin about Philip Carey. She ran to take off her bonnet,\r\nwhile Henrietta went to announce her coming. She knocked at the door,\r\nHenrietta opened it, and coming in, she saw Fred lying on the sofa by\r\nthe fire, in his dressing-gown, stretched out in that languid listless\r\nmanner that betokens great feebleness. There were the purple marks of\r\nleeches on his temples; his hair had been cropped close to his head; his\r\nface was long and thin, without a shade of colour, but his eyes looked\r\nlarge and bright; and he smiled and held out his hand: "Ah, Queenie, how\r\nd\'ye do?"\r\n\r\n"How d\'ye do, Fred? I am glad you are better."\r\n\r\n"You see I have the asses\' ears after all," said he, pointing to his\r\nown, which were very prominent in his shorn and shaven condition.\r\n\r\nBeatrice could not very easily call up a smile, but she made an effort,\r\nand succeeded, while she said, "I should have complimented you on the\r\nincreased wisdom of your looks. I did not know the shape of your head\r\nwas so like papa\'s."\r\n\r\n"Is Aunt Geoffrey come?" asked Fred.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said his sister: "but mamma thinks you had better not see her\r\ntill to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I wish Uncle Geoffrey was not going," said Fred. "Nobody else has the\r\nleast notion of making one tolerably comfortable."\r\n\r\n"O, your mamma, Fred!" said Queen Bee.\r\n\r\n"O yes, mamma, of course! But then she is getting fagged."\r\n\r\n"Mamma says she is quite unhappy to have kept him so long from his work\r\nin London," said Henrietta; "but I do not know what we should have done\r\nwithout him."\r\n\r\n"I do not know what we shall do now," said Fred, in a languid and\r\ndoleful tone.\r\n\r\nThe Queen Bee, thinking this a capital opportunity, spoke with almost\r\nalarmed eagerness, "O yes, Fred, you will get on famously; you will\r\nenjoy having my mamma so much, and you are so much better already, and\r\nPhilip Carey manages you so well--"\r\n\r\n"Manages!" said Fred; "ay, and I\'ll tell you how, Queenie; just as the\r\nman managed his mare when he fed her on a straw a day. I believe he\r\nthinks I am a ghool, and can live on a grain of rice. I only wish he\r\nknew himself what starvation is. Look here! you can almost see the fire\r\nthrough my hand, and if I do but lift up my head, the whole room is in a\r\nmerry-go-round. And that is nothing but weakness; there is nothing\r\nelse on earth the matter with me, except that I am starved down to the\r\nstrength of a midge!"\r\n\r\n"Well, but of course he knows," said Busy Bee; "Papa says he has had an\r\nexcellent education, and he must know."\r\n\r\n"To be sure he does, perfectly well: he is a sharp fellow, and knows how\r\nto keep a patient when he has got one."\r\n\r\n"How can you talk such nonsense, Fred? One comfort is, that it is a sign\r\nyou are getting well, or you would not have spirits to do it."\r\n\r\n"I am talking no nonsense," said Fred, sharply; "I am as serious as\r\npossible."\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t really think that if Philip was capable of acting in such\r\nan atrocious way, that papa would not find it out, and the other doctor\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\n"What! when that man gets I don\'t know how many guineas from mamma every\r\ntime he comes, do you think that it is for his interest that I should\r\nget well?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Fred," interposed his sister, "you are exciting yourself, and\r\nthat is so very bad for you."\r\n\r\n"I do assure you, Henrietta, you would find it very little exciting to\r\nbe shut up in this room with half a teaspoonful of wishy-washy pudding\r\ntwice a day, and all just to fill Philip Carey\'s pockets! Now, there was\r\nold Clarke at Rocksand, he had some feeling for one, poor old fellow;\r\nbut this man, not the slightest compunction has he; and I am ready to\r\nkick him out of the room when I hear that silky voice of his trying\r\nto be gen-tee-eel, and condoling; and those boots--O! Busy Bee! those\r\nboots! whenever he makes a step I always hear them say, \'O what a pretty\r\nfellow I am!\'"\r\n\r\n"You seem to be very merry here, my dears," said Aunt Mary, coming in;\r\n"but I am afraid you will tire yourself, Freddy; I heard your voice even\r\nbefore I opened the door."\r\n\r\nFred was silent, a little ashamed, for he had sense enough not\r\nabsolutely to believe all that he had been saying, and his mother,\r\nsitting down, began to talk to the visitor, "Well, my little Queen, we\r\nhave seen very little of you of late, but we shall be very sorry to lose\r\nyou. I suppose your mamma will have all your letters, and Henrietta must\r\nnot expect any, but we shall want very much to know how you get on with\r\nAunt Susan and her little dog."\r\n\r\n"O very well, I dare say," said Beatrice, rather absently, for she was\r\nlooking at her aunt\'s delicate fragile form, and thinking of what her\r\nfather had been saying.\r\n\r\n"And Queenie," continued her aunt, earnestly, "you must take great\r\ncare of your papa--make him rest, and listen to your music, and read\r\nstory-books instead of going back to his work all the evening."\r\n\r\n"To be sure I shall, Aunt Mary, as much as I possibly can."\r\n\r\n"But Bee," said Fred, "you don\'t mean that you are going to be shut up\r\nwith that horrid Lady Susan all this time? Why don\'t you stay here, and\r\nlet her take care of herself?"\r\n\r\n"Mamma would not like that; and besides, to do her justice, she is\r\nreally ill, Fred," said Beatrice.\r\n\r\n"It is too bad, now I am just getting better--if they would let me, I\r\nmean," said Fred: "just when I could enjoy having you, and now there you\r\ngo off to that old woman. It is a downright shame."\r\n\r\n"So it is, Fred," said Queen Bee gaily, but not coquettishly, as once\r\nshe would have answered him, "a great shame in you not to have learned\r\nto feel for other people, now you know what it is to be ill yourself."\r\n\r\n"That is right, Bee," said Aunt Mary, smiling; "tell him he ought to\r\nbe ashamed of having monopolized you all so long, and spoilt all the\r\ncomfort of your household. I am sure I am," added she, her eyes filling\r\nwith tears, as she affectionately patted Beatrice\'s hand.\r\n\r\nQueen Bee\'s heart was very full, but she knew that to give way to\r\nthe expression of her feelings would be hurtful to Fred, and she only\r\npressed her aunt\'s long thin fingers very earnestly, and turned her face\r\nto the fire, while she struggled down the rising emotion. There was\r\na little silence, and when they began to talk again, it was of the\r\nengravings at which Fred had just been looking. The visit lasted till\r\nthe dressing bell rang, when Beatrice was obliged to go, and she shook\r\nhands with Fred, saying cheerfully, "Well, good-bye, I hope you will be\r\nbetter friends with the doctors next time I see you."\r\n\r\n"Never will I like one inch of a doctor, never!" repeated Fred, as she\r\nleft the room, and ran to snatch what moments she could with her mamma\r\nin the space allowed for dressing.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma was happy that evening, for, except poor Frederick\'s own\r\nplace, there were no melancholy gaps at the dinner-table. He had Bennet\r\nto sit with him, and besides, there was within call the confidential old\r\nman-servant, who had lived so many years at Rocksand, and in whom both\r\nFred and his mother placed considerable dependence.\r\n\r\nEverything looked like recovery; Mrs. Frederick Langford came down and\r\ntalked and smiled like her own sweet self; Mrs. Geoffrey Langford was\r\nready to hear all the news, old Mr. Langford was quite in spirits again,\r\nHenrietta was bright and lively. The thought of long days in London with\r\nLady Susan, and of long evenings with no mamma, and with papa either\r\nwriting or at his chambers, began from force of contrast to seem doubly\r\nlike banishment to poor little Queen Bee, but whatever faults she had,\r\nshe was no repiner. "I deserve it," said she to herself, "and surely\r\nI ought to bear my share of the trouble my wilfulness has occasioned.\r\nBesides, with even one little bit of papa\'s company I am only too well\r\noff."\r\n\r\nSo she smiled, and answered grandpapa in her favourite style, so that no\r\none would have guessed from her demeanour that a task had been imposed\r\nupon her which she so much disliked, and in truth her thoughts were\r\nmuch more on others than on herself. She saw all hopeful and happy about\r\nFred, and as to her aunt, when she saw her as usual with all her playful\r\ngentleness, she could not think that there was anything seriously\r\namiss with her, or if there was, mamma would find out and set it all to\r\nrights. Then how soothing and comforting, now that the first acute pain\r\nof remorse was over, was that affectionate kindness, which, in every\r\nlittle gesture and word, Aunt Mary had redoubled to her ever since the\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nFred was all this time lying on his sofa, very glad to rest after so\r\nmuch talking: weak, dizzy, and languid, and throwing all the blame of\r\nhis uncomfortable sensations on Philip Carey and the starvation system,\r\nbut still, perhaps, not without thoughts of a less discontented nature,\r\nfor when Mr. Geoffrey Langford came to help him to bed, he said, as\r\nhe watched the various arrangements his uncle was for the last time\r\nsedulously making for his comfort, "Uncle Geoffrey, I ought to thank you\r\nvery much; I am afraid I have been a great plague to you."\r\n\r\nPerhaps Fred did not say this in all sincerity, for any one but Uncle\r\nGeoffrey would have completely disowned the plaguing, and he fully\r\nexpected him to do so; but his uncle had a stern regard for truth,\r\ncoupled with a courtesy which left it no more harshness than was\r\nsalutary.\r\n\r\n"Anything for your good, my dear sir," said he, with a smile. "You are\r\nwelcome to plague me as much as you like, only remember that your mamma\r\nis not quite so tough."\r\n\r\n"Well, I do try to be considerate about her," said Fred. "I mean to make\r\nher rest as much as possible; Henrietta and I have been settling how to\r\nsave her."\r\n\r\n"You could save her more than all, Fred, if you would spare her\r\ndiscussions."\r\n\r\nFred held his tongue, for though his memory was rather cloudy about the\r\nearly part of his illness, he did remember having seen her look greatly\r\nharassed one day lately when he had been arguing against Philip Carey.\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey proceeded to gather up some of the outlines which\r\nHenrietta had left on the sofa. "I like those very much," said Fred,\r\n"especially the Fight with the Dragon."\r\n\r\n"You know Schiller\'s poem on it?" said Uncle Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Henrietta has it in German."\r\n\r\n"Well, it is what I should especially recommend to your consideration."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it will be long enough before I am able to go out on a\r\ndragon-killing expedition," said Fred, with a weary helpless sigh.\r\n\r\n"Fight the dragon at home, then, Freddy. Now is the time for--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'The duty hardest to fulfil,\r\n     To learn to yield our own self-will.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"There is very little hasty pudding in the case," said Fred, rather\r\ndisconsolately, and at the same time rather drolly, and with a sort of\r\nresolution of this kind, "I will try then, I will not bother mamma, let\r\nthat Carey serve me as he may. I will not make a fuss, if I can help it,\r\nunless he is very unreasonable indeed, and when I get well I will submit\r\nto be coddled in an exemplary manner; I only wonder when I shall feel up\r\nto anything again! O! what a nuisance it is to have this swimming head\r\nand aching knees, all by the fault of that Carey!"\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey said no more, for he thought a hint often was more useful\r\nthan a lecture, even if Fred had been in a state for the latter, and\r\nbesides he was in greater request than ever on this last evening, so\r\nmuch so that it seemed as if no one was going to spare him even to have\r\nhalf an hour\'s talk with his wife. He did find the time for this at\r\nlast, however, and his first question was, "What do you think of the\r\nlittle Bee?"\r\n\r\n"I think with great hope, much more satisfactorily than I have been able\r\nto do for some time past," was the answer.\r\n\r\n"Poor child, she has felt it very deeply," said he, "I have been grieved\r\nto have so little time to bestow on her."\r\n\r\n"I am disposed to think," said Mrs. Geoffrey Langford, thoughtfully,\r\n"that it was the best thing for her to be thrown on herself. Too much\r\ntalk has always been the mischief with her, as with many another only\r\nchild, and it struck me to-day as a very good sign that she said so\r\nlittle. There was something very touching in the complete absence of\r\nmoralizing to-day."\r\n\r\n"None of her sensible sayings," said her father, with a gratified though\r\na grave smile. "It was perfectly open confession, and yet with no self\r\nin it. Ever since the accident there has been a staidness and sedateness\r\nabout her manner which seemed like great improvement, as far as I have\r\nseen. And when it was proposed for her to go to Lady Susan, I was much\r\npleased with her, she was so simple: \'Very well,\' she said, \'I hope I\r\nshall be able to make her comfortable:\' no begging off, no heroism. And\r\nreally, Beatrice, don\'t you think we could make some other arrangement?\r\nIt is too great a penance for her, poor child. Lady Susan will do very\r\nwell, and I can have an eye to her; I am much inclined to leave the poor\r\nlittle Queen here with you."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Geoffrey," said his wife, "that would never do: I do not mean\r\non my aunt\'s account, but on the Busy Bee\'s; I am sure, wish it as we\r\nmay," and the tears were in her eyes, "this is no time for even the\r\nsemblance of neglecting a duty for her sake."\r\n\r\n"Not so much hers as yours," said Mr. Geoffrey Langford, "you have more\r\non your hands than I like to leave you alone to encounter, and she is a\r\nvaluable little assistant. Besides you have been without her so long, it\r\nis your turn to keep her now."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," she repeated, though not without an effort, "it is best as\r\nit is settled for all, and decidedly so for me, for with her to write\r\nto me about you every day, and to look after you, I shall be a hundred\r\ntimes more at ease than if I thought you were working yourself to death\r\nwith no one to remonstrate."\r\n\r\nSo it remained as before decided, and the pain that the decision cost\r\nboth mother and daughter was only to be inferred by the way in which\r\nthey kept close together, as if determined not to lose unnecessarily one\r\nfragment of each other\'s company; but they had very few moments alone\r\ntogether, and those were chiefly employed in practical matters, in\r\nminute directions as to the little things that conduced to keep Lady\r\nSusan in good humour, and above all, the arrangements for papa\'s\r\ncomfort. There was thus not much time for Beatrice to spend with\r\nHenrietta, nor indeed would much have resulted if there had been more.\r\nAs she grew more at ease about her brother, Henrietta had gradually\r\nresumed her usual manner, and was now as affectionate to Beatrice as\r\never, but she was quite unconscious of her previous unkindness, and\r\ntherefore made no attempt to atone for it. Queen Bee had ceased to think\r\nof it, and if a reserve had grown up between the two girls, they neither\r\nof them perceived it.\r\n\r\nMr. Geoffrey Langford and his daughter set out on their return to London\r\nso early the next morning that hardly any of the family were up; but\r\ntheir hurried breakfast in the grey of morning was enlivened by Alex,\r\nwho came in just in time to exchange some last words with Uncle Geoffrey\r\nabout his school work, and to wish Queen Bee good-bye, with hopes of a\r\nmerrier meeting next summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Geoffrey Langford had from the first felt considerable anxiety\r\nfor her sister-in-law, who, though cheerful as ever, began at length to\r\nallow that she felt worn out, and consented to spare herself more than\r\nshe had hitherto done. The mischief was, however, not to be averted, and\r\nafter a few days of increasing languor, she was attacked by a severe\r\nfit of the spasms, to which she had for several years been subject at\r\nintervals, and was obliged to confine herself entirely to her own room,\r\nrelying with complete confidence on her sister for the attendance on her\r\nson.\r\n\r\nIt was to her, however, that Mrs. Geoffrey Langford wished most to\r\ndevote herself; viewing her case with more uneasiness than that of\r\nFrederick, who was decidedly on the fair road to convalescence; and she\r\nonly gave him as much time as was necessary to satisfy his mother, and\r\nto superintend the regulation of his room. He had all the society he\r\nwanted in his sister, who was always with him, and in grandpapa and\r\ngrandmamma, whose short and frequent visits he began greatly to\r\nenjoy. He had also been more amenable to authority of late, partly in\r\nconsequence of his uncle\'s warning, partly because it was not quite so\r\neasy to torment an aunt as a mother, and partly too because, excepting\r\nalways the starving system, he had nothing in particular of which to\r\ncomplain. His mother\'s illness might also have its effect in subduing\r\nhim; but it did not dwell much on his spirits, or Henrietta\'s, as they\r\nwere too much accustomed to her ill health to be easily alarmed on her\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of the holidays, and Alexander was to come late in\r\nthe afternoon--Fred\'s best time in the day--to take his leave. All the\r\nmorning Fred was rather out of spirits, and talked to Henrietta a good\r\ndeal about his school life. It might have been a melancholy day if he\r\nhad been going back to school, but it was more sad to be obliged to stay\r\naway from the world where he had hitherto been measuring his powers, and\r\nfinding his most exciting interests. It was very mortifying to be\r\nthus laid helplessly aside; a mere nobody, instead of an important and\r\nleading member of a community; at such an age too that it was probable\r\nthat he would never return there again.\r\n\r\nHe began to describe to Henrietta all the scenes where he would be\r\nmissing, but not missed; the old cathedral town, with its nest of trees,\r\nand the chalky hills; the quiet river creeping through the meadows:\r\nthe "beech-crowned steep," girdled in with the "hollow trench that the\r\nDanish pirate made;" the old collegiate courts, the painted windows of\r\nthe chapel, the surpliced scholars,--even the very shops in the streets\r\nhad their part in his description: and then falling into silence he\r\nsighed at the thought that there he would be known no more,--all would\r\ngo on as usual, and after a few passing inquiries and expressions of\r\ncompassion, he would be forgotten; his rivals would pass him in the race\r\nof distinction; his school-boy career be at an end.\r\n\r\nHis reflections were interrupted by Mrs. Langford\'s entrance with Aunt\r\nGeoffrey, bringing a message of invitation from grandpapa to Henrietta,\r\nto walk with him to Sutton Leigh. She went; and Aunt Geoffrey, after\r\nputting a book within Fred\'s reach, and seeing that he and grandmamma\r\nwere quite willing to be companionable, again returned to his mother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Langford thought him low and depressed, and began talking about his\r\nhealth, and the present mode of treatment,--a subject on which they were\r\nperfectly agreed: one being as much inclined to bestow a good diet as\r\nthe other could be to receive it. If his head was still often painfully\r\ndizzy and confused; if his eyes dazzled when he attempted to read for\r\na long time together; if he could not stand or walk across the room\r\nwithout excessive giddiness--what was that but the effect of want of\r\nnourishment? "If there was a craving, that was a sure sign that the\r\nthing was wholesome." So she said, and her grandson assented with his\r\nwhole heart.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she left the room, and presently returned with a most\r\ntempting-looking glass of clear amber-coloured jelly.\r\n\r\n"O, grandmamma!" said Fred, doubtfully, though his eyes positively\r\nlighted up at the sight.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, I had it made for your mamma, and she says it is very\r\ngood. It is as clear as possible, and quite innocent; I am sure it must\r\ndo you good."\r\n\r\n"Thank you! O, thank you! It does look very nice," said Fred, gazing on\r\nit with wistful eyes, "but really I do not think I ought."\r\n\r\n"If it was to do you any harm, I am sure I should not think of such a\r\nthing," said Mrs. Langford. "But I have lived a good many more years in\r\nthe world than these young people, and I never saw any good come of all\r\nthis keeping low. There was old Mr. Hilton, now, that attended all the\r\nneighbourhood round when I was a girl; he kept you low enough while the\r\nfever was on you, but as soon as it was gone, why then reinvigorate the\r\nsystem,--that was what he used to say."\r\n\r\n"Just like old Clarke, of Rocksand!" sighed Fred. "I know my system\r\nwould like nothing better than to be re-invigorated with that splendid\r\nstuff; but you would know it would put them all in a dreadful state if\r\nthey knew it."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said grandmamma; "\'tis all my doing, you know. Come, to\r\noblige me, taste it, my dear."\r\n\r\n"One spoonful," said Fred--"to oblige grandmamma," added he to himself:\r\nand he let grandmamma lift him on the cushions as far as he could\r\nbear to have his head raised. He took the spoonful, then started a\r\nlittle,--"There is wine in it!" said he.\r\n\r\n"A very little--just enough to give it a flavour; it cannot make any\r\ndifference. Do you like it, my dear?" as the spoon scooped out another\r\ntransparent rock. "Ay, that is right! I had the receipt from my old Aunt\r\nKitty, and nobody ever could make it like Judith."\r\n\r\n"I am in for it now," thought Fred. "Well, \'tis excellent," said he;\r\n"capital stuff! I feel it all down to my fingers\' ends," added he with a\r\nsmile, as he returned the glass, after fishing in vain for the particles\r\nremaining in the small end.\r\n\r\n"That is right; I am so glad to see you enjoy it!" said grandmamma,\r\nhurrying off with the empty glass with speed at which Fred smiled, as it\r\nimplied some fears of meeting Aunt Geoffrey. He knew the nature of\r\nhis own case sufficiently to be aware that he had acted very\r\nimprudently,--that is to say, his better sense was aware--but his spirit\r\nof self-will made him consider all these precautions as nonsense, and\r\nwas greatly confirmed by his feeling himself much more fresh and lively.\r\nGrandmamma returned to announce Alexander and Willy, who soon followed\r\nher, and after shaking hands, stood silent, much shocked at the\r\nalteration in Fred\'s appearance.\r\n\r\nThis impression, however, soon passed off, as Fred began to talk over\r\nschool affairs in a very animated manner; sending messages to his\r\nfriends, discussing the interests of the coming half-year, the games,\r\nthe studies, the employments; Alex lamenting Fred\'s absence, engaging\r\nto write, undertaking numerous commissions, and even prognosticating his\r\nspeedy recovery, and attainment of that cynosure,--the prize. Never had\r\nthe two cousins met so cordially, or so enjoyed their meeting. There was\r\nno competition; each could afford to do the other justice, and both\r\nfelt great satisfaction in doing so; and so high and even so loud\r\nbecame their glee, that Alex could scarcely believe that Fred was not\r\nin perfect health. At last Aunt Geoffrey came to put an end to it;\r\nand finding Fred so much excited, she made Alex bring his blunt honest\r\nfarewells and good wishes to a speedy conclusion, desired Fred to lie\r\nquiet and rest, and sat down herself to see that he did so.\r\n\r\nFred could not easily be brought to repose; he went on talking fast and\r\neagerly in praise of Alex, and in spite of her complete assent, he went\r\non more and more vehemently, just as if he was defending Alex from some\r\none who wanted to detract from his merits. She tried reading to him, but\r\nhe grew too eager about the book; and at last she rather advanced the\r\ntime for dressing for dinner, both for herself and Henrietta, and\r\nsent Bennet to sit with him, hoping thus perforce to reduce him to a\r\nquiescent state. He was by this means a little calmed for the rest of\r\nthe evening; but so wakeful and restless a night ensued, that he began\r\nto be alarmed, and fully came to the conclusion that Philip Carey was\r\nin the right after all. Towards morning, however, a short sleep\r\nvisited him, and he awoke at length quite sufficiently refreshed to be\r\nself-willed as ever; and, contrary to advice, insisted on leaving his\r\nbed at his usual hour.\r\n\r\nPhilip Carey came at about twelve o\'clock, and was disappointed as well\r\nas surprised to find him so much more languid and uncomfortable, as\r\nhe could not help allowing that he felt. His pulse, too, was\r\nunsatisfactory; but Philip thought the excitement of the interview\r\nwith Alex well accounted for the sleepless night, as well as for the\r\nexhaustion of the present day: and Fred persuaded himself to believe so\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nHenrietta did not like to leave him to-day, but she was engaged to take\r\na ride with grandpapa, who felt as if the little Mary of years long gone\r\nby was restored to him, when he had acquired a riding companion in\r\nhis granddaughter. Mrs. Langford undertook to sit with Fred, and Mrs.\r\nGeoffrey Langford, who had been at first afraid that she would be\r\ntoo bustling a nurse for him just now, seeing that he was evidently\r\nimpatient to be left alone with her, returned to Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford, resolving, however, not to be long absent.\r\n\r\nIn that interval Mrs. Langford brought in the inviting glass, and Fred,\r\nin spite of his good sense, could not resist it. Perhaps the recent\r\nirritation of Philip\'s last visit made him more willing to act in\r\nopposition to his orders. At any rate, he thought of little save of\r\nswallowing it before Aunt Geoffrey should catch him in the fact, in\r\nwhich he succeeded; so that grandmamma had time to get the tell-tale\r\nglass safely into the store-closet just as Mrs. Frederick Langford\'s\r\ndoor was opened at the other end of the passage.\r\n\r\nFred\'s sofa cushions were all too soft or too hard that afternoon,--too\r\nhigh or too low; there was a great mountain in the middle of the sofa,\r\ntoo, so that he could not lie on it comfortably. The room was chilly\r\nthough the fire was hot, and how grandmamma did poke it! Fred thought\r\nshe did nothing else the whole afternoon; and there was a certain\r\nconcluding shovel that she gave to the cinders, that very nearly put him\r\nin a passion. Nothing would make him comfortable till Henrietta came\r\nin, and it seemed very long before he heard the paddock gate, and the\r\nhorses\' feet upon the gravel. Then he grew very much provoked because\r\nhis sister went first to her mamma\'s room; and it was grandpapa who came\r\nto him full of a story of Henrietta\'s good management of her horse when\r\nthey suddenly met the hounds in a narrow lane. In she came, at last, in\r\nher habit, her hair hanging loosely round her face, her cheeks and\r\neyes lighted up by the exercise, and some early primroses in her hand,\r\nbegging his pardon for having kept him waiting, but saying she thought\r\nhe did not want her directly, as he had grandpapa.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he scolded her, ordered her specimens of the promise of\r\nspring out of the room on an accusation of their possessing a strong\r\nscent, made her make a complete revolution on his sofa, and then\r\ninsisted on her going on with Nicolo de Lapi, which she was translating\r\nto him from the Italian. Warm as the room felt to her in her habit, she\r\nsat down directly, without going to take it off; but he was not to\r\nbe thus satisfied. He found fault with her for hesitating in her\r\ntranslation, and desired her to read the Italian instead; then she read\r\nfirst so fast that he could not follow, and then so slowly that it was\r\nquite unbearable, and she must go on translating. With the greatest\r\npatience and sweetest temper she obeyed; only when next he interrupted\r\nher to find fault, she stopped and said gently, "Dear Fred, I am afraid\r\nyou are not feeling so well."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! What should make you think so? You think I am cross, I\r\nsuppose. Well, never mind, I will go on for myself," said he, snatching\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\nHenrietta turned away to hide her tears, for she was too wise to\r\nvindicate herself.\r\n\r\n"Are you crying? I am sure I said nothing to cry about; I wish you would\r\nnot be so silly."\r\n\r\n"If you would only let me go on, dear Fred," said she, thinking that\r\noccupying him would be better than arguing. "It is so dark where you\r\nare, and I will try to get on better. There is an easier piece coming."\r\n\r\nFred agreed, and she went on without interruption for some little time,\r\ntill at last he grew so excited by the story as to be very angry when\r\nthe failing light obliged her to pause. She tried to extract some light\r\nfrom the fire, but this was a worse offence than any; it was too bad\r\nof her, when she knew how he hated both the sound of poking, and that\r\nhorrible red flickering light which always hurt his eyes. This dislike,\r\nwhich had been one of the symptoms of the early part of his illness, so\r\nalarmed her that she had thoughts of going to call Aunt Geoffrey, and\r\nwas heartily glad to see her enter the room.\r\n\r\n"Well, how are you going on?" she said, cheerfully. "Why, my dear, how\r\nhot you must be in that habit!"\r\n\r\n"Rather," said poor Henrietta, whose face, between the heat and her\r\nperplexity, was almost crimson. "We have been reading \'Nicolo,\' and I\r\nam very much afraid it is as bad as Alex\'s visit, and has excited Fred\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"I am quite sick of hearing that word excitement!" said Fred,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"Almost as tired as of having your pulse felt," said Aunt Geoffrey. "But\r\nyet I must ask you to submit to that disagreeable necessity."\r\n\r\nFred moved pettishly, but as he could not refuse, he only told Henrietta\r\nthat he could not bear any one to look at him while his pulse was felt.\r\n\r\n"Will you fetch me a candle, my dear?" said Aunt Geoffrey, amazed as\r\nwell as terrified by the fearful rapidity of the throbs, and trying to\r\nacquire sufficient composure to count them calmly. The light came, and\r\nstill she held his wrist, beginning her reckoning again and again, in\r\nthe hope that it was only some momentary agitation that had so quickened\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"What! \'tis faster?" asked Fred, speaking in a hasty alarmed tone, when\r\nshe released him at last.\r\n\r\n"You are flushed, Fred," she answered very quietly, though she felt\r\nfull of consternation. "Yes, faster than it ought to be; I think you had\r\nbetter not sit up any longer this evening, or you will sleep no better\r\nthan last night."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Then I will ring for Stephens," said she.\r\n\r\nThe first thing she did on leaving his room was to go to her own, and\r\nthere write a note to young Mr. Carey, giving an account of the symptoms\r\nthat had caused her so much alarm. As she wrote them down without\r\nexaggeration, and trying to give each its just weight, going back to\r\nrecollect the first unfavourable sign, she suddenly remembered that as\r\nshe left her sister\'s room, she had seen Mrs. Langford, whom she had\r\nleft with Fred, at the door of the store-closet. Could she have been\r\ngiving him any of her favourite nourishing things? Mrs. Geoffrey\r\nLangford could hardly believe that either party could have acted so\r\nfoolishly, yet when she remembered a few words that had passed about the\r\njelly that morning at breakfast, she could no longer doubt, and bitterly\r\nreproached herself for not having kept up a stricter surveillance. Of\r\nher suspicion she however said nothing, but sealing her note, she went\r\ndown to the drawing-room, told Mr. Langford that she did not think Fred\r\nquite so well that evening, and asked him if he did not think it might\r\nbe better to let Philip Carey know. He agreed instantly, and rang the\r\nbell to order a servant to ride to Allonfield; but Mrs. Langford, who\r\ncould not bear any one but Geoffrey to act without consulting her,\r\npitied man and horse for being out so late, and opined that Beatrice\r\nforgot that she was not in London, where the medical man could be called\r\nin so easily.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that it was the elder Beatrice instead of the younger,\r\nfor provoked as she already had been before with the old lady, it was\r\nnot easy even for her to make a cheerful answer. "Well, it is very kind\r\nin you to attend to my London fancies," said she; "I think if we can do\r\nanything to spare him such a night as the last, it should be tried."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly," said Mr. Langford. "It is very disappointing\r\nwhen he was going on so well. He must surely have been doing something\r\nimprudent."\r\n\r\nIt was very tempting to interrogate Mrs. Langford, but her\r\ndaughter-in-law had long since come to a resolution never to convey to\r\nher anything like reproach, let her do what she might in her mistaken\r\nkindness of heart, or her respectable prejudices; so, without\r\nentering on what many in her place might have made a scene of polite\r\nrecrimination, she left the room, and on her way up, heard Frederick\'s\r\ndoor gently opened. Stephens came quickly and softly to the end of\r\nthe passage to meet her. "He is asking for you, ma\'am," said he; "I am\r\nafraid he is not so well; I did not like to ring, for fear of alarming\r\nmy mistress, but--"\r\n\r\nMrs. Geoffrey Langford entered the room, and found that the bustle and\r\nexertion of being carried to his bed had brought on excessive confusion\r\nand violent pain. He put his hand to his forehead, opened his eyes, and\r\nlooked wildly about. "Oh, Aunt Geoffrey," he exclaimed, "what shall I\r\ndo? It is as bad--worse than ever!"\r\n\r\n"You have been doing something imprudent, I fear," said Aunt Geoffrey,\r\ndetermined to come to the truth at once.\r\n\r\n"Only that glass of jelly--if I had guessed!"\r\n\r\n"Only one?"\r\n\r\n"One to-day, one yesterday. It was grandmamma\'s doing. Don\'t let her\r\nknow that I told. I wish mamma was here!"\r\n\r\nAunt Geoffrey tried to relieve the pain by cold applications, but could\r\nnot succeed, and Fred grew more and more alarmed.\r\n\r\n"The inflammation is coming back!" he cried, in an agony of apprehension\r\nthat almost overcame the sense of pain. "I shall be in danger--I shall\r\nlose my senses--I shall die! Mamma! O! where is mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Lie still, my dear Fred," said Mrs. Geoffrey Langford, laying her hand\r\non him so as to restrain his struggling movements to turn round or to\r\nsit up. "Resistance and agitation will hurt you more than anything else.\r\nYou must control yourself, and trust to me, and you may be sure I will\r\ndo the best in my power for you. The rest is in the hands of God."\r\n\r\n"Then you think me very ill?" said Fred, trying to speak more\r\ncomposedly.\r\n\r\n"I think you will certainly make yourself very ill, unless you will\r\nkeep yourself quiet, both mind and body. There--" she settled him as\r\ncomfortably as she could: "Now I am going away for a few minutes. Make\r\na resolution not to stir till I come back. Stephens is here, and I shall\r\nsoon come back."\r\n\r\nThis was very unlike the way in which his mother used to beseech him as\r\na favour to spare her, and yet his aunt\'s tone was so affectionate, as\r\nwell as so authoritative, that he could not feel it unkind. She left\r\nthe room, and as soon as she found herself alone in the passage, leant\r\nagainst the wall and trembled, for she felt herself for a moment quite\r\noverwhelmed, and longed earnestly for her husband to think for her,\r\nor even for one short interval in which to reflect. For this, however,\r\nthere was no time, and with one earnest mental supplication, summoning\r\nup her energies, she walked on to the person whom she at that moment\r\nmost dreaded to see, her sister-in-law. She found her sitting in her\r\narm-chair, Henrietta with her, both looking very anxious, and she was\r\nglad to find her prepared.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" was the first eager question.\r\n\r\n"He has been attempting rather too much of late," was the answer, "and\r\nhas knocked himself up. I came to tell you, because I think I had better\r\nstay with him, and perhaps you might miss me."\r\n\r\n"O no, no, pray go to him. Nothing satisfies me so well about him as\r\nthat you should be there, except that I cannot bear to give you so much\r\ntrouble. Don\'t stay here answering questions. He will be so restless if\r\nhe misses you--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you sit imagining, Mary; let Henrietta read to you."\r\n\r\nThis proposal made Henrietta look so piteous and wistful that her mother\r\nsaid, "No, no, let her go to Freddy, poor child. I dare say he wants\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"By no means," said Aunt Geoffrey, opening the door; "he will be quieter\r\nwithout her."\r\n\r\nHenrietta was annoyed, and walked about the room, instead of sitting\r\ndown to read. She was too fond of her own will to like being thus\r\nchecked, and she thought she had quite as good a right to be with her\r\nbrother as her aunt could have. Every temper has one side or other on\r\nwhich it is susceptible; and this was hers. She thought it affection for\r\nher brother, whereas it was impatience of being ordered.\r\n\r\nHer mother forced herself to speak cheerfully. "Aunt Geoffrey is a\r\ncapital nurse," said she; "there is something so decided about her that\r\nit always does one good. It saves all the trouble and perplexity of\r\nthinking for oneself."\r\n\r\n"I had rather judge for myself," said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"That is all very well to talk of," said her mother, smiling sadly, "but\r\nit is a very different thing when you are obliged to do it."\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you like to hear?" said Henrietta, who found herself too\r\ncross for conversation. "The old man\'s home?"\r\n\r\n"Do not read unless you like it, my dear; I think you must be tired.\r\nYou would want \'lungs of brass\' to go on all day to both of us. You had\r\nbetter not. I should like to talk."\r\n\r\nHenrietta being in a wilful fit, chose nevertheless to read, because it\r\ngave her the satisfaction of feeling that Aunt Geoffrey was inflicting\r\na hardship upon her; although her mother would have preferred\r\nconversation. So she took up a book, and began, without any perception\r\nof the sense of what she was reading, but her thoughts dwelling partly\r\non her brother, and partly on her aunt\'s provoking ways. She read on\r\nthrough a whole chapter, then closing the book hastily, exclaimed, "I\r\nmust go and see what Aunt Geoffrey is doing with Fred."\r\n\r\n"She is not such a very dangerous person," said Mrs. Frederick Langford,\r\nalmost laughing at the form of the expression.\r\n\r\n"Well, but you surely want to know how he is, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure I do, but I am so afraid of his being disturbed. If he was\r\njust going to sleep now."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but you know how softly I can open the door."\r\n\r\n"Your aunt would let us know if there was anything to hear. Pray take\r\ncare, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I must go, I can\'t bear it any longer; I will only just listen," said\r\nHenrietta; "I will not be a moment."\r\n\r\n"Let me have the book, my dear," said her mother, who knew but too well\r\nthe length of Henrietta\'s moments, and who had just, by means of a great\r\neffort, succeeded in making herself take interest in the book.\r\n\r\nHenrietta gave it to her, and darted off. The door of Fred\'s room was\r\najar, and she entered. Aunt Geoffrey, Bennet, and Judith were standing\r\nround the bed, her aunt sponging away the blood that was flowing from\r\nFrederick\'s temples. His eyes were closed, and he now and then gave long\r\ngasping sighs of oppression and faintness. "Leeches!" thought Henrietta,\r\nas she started with consternation and displeasure. "This is pretty\r\nstrong! Without telling me or mamma! Well, this is what I call doing\r\nsomething with him indeed."\r\n\r\nShe advanced to the table, but no one saw her for more than a minute,\r\ntill at last Aunt Geoffrey stepped quickly up to it in search of some\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n"Let me do something," said Henrietta, catching up the bottle that she\r\nthought likely to be the right one.\r\n\r\nHer aunt looked vexed, and answered in a low quick tone, "You had better\r\nstay with your mamma."\r\n\r\n"But why are you doing this? Is he worse? Is Mr. Philip Carey here? Has\r\nhe ordered it?"\r\n\r\n"He is not come yet. My dear, I cannot talk to you: I should be much\r\nobliged if you would go back to your mamma."\r\n\r\nAunt Geoffrey went back to Fred, but a few minutes after she looked\r\nup and still saw Henrietta standing by the table. She came up to her,\r\n"Henrietta, you are of no use here; every additional person oppresses\r\nhim; your mamma must be kept tranquil. Why will you stay?"\r\n\r\n"I was just going," said Henrietta, taking this hurrying as an\r\nadditional offence, and walking off in a dignified way.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to say what had affronted her most, the proceeding itself,\r\nthe neglect, or the commands which Aunt Geoffrey had presumed to\r\nlay upon her, and away she went to her mamma, a great deal too much\r\ndispleased, and too distrustful to pay the smallest attention to any\r\nprecautions which her aunt might have tried to impress upon her.\r\n\r\n"Well!" asked her mother anxiously.\r\n\r\n"She would not let me stay," answered Henrietta. "She has been putting\r\non leeches."\r\n\r\n"Leeches!" exclaimed her mother. "He must be much worse. Poor fellow! Is\r\nMr. Carey here?"\r\n\r\n"No, that is the odd thing."\r\n\r\n"Has he not been sent for?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know. Aunt Geoffrey seems to like to do things in her\r\nown way."\r\n\r\n"It must be very bad indeed if she cannot venture to wait for him!" said\r\nMrs. Frederick Langford, much alarmed.\r\n\r\n"And never to tell you!" said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"O, that was her consideration. She knew how foolishly anxious I should\r\nbe. I have no doubt that she is doing right. How did he seem to be?"\r\n\r\n"Very faint, I thought," said Henrietta, "there seemed to be a great\r\ndeal of bleeding, but Aunt Geoffrey would not let me come near."\r\n\r\n"She knows exactly what to do," said Mrs. Frederick Langford. "How well\r\nit was that she should be here."\r\n\r\nHenrietta began to be so fretted at her mother\'s complete confidence in\r\nher aunt, that without thinking of the consequences she tried to argue\r\nit away. "Aunt Geoffrey is so quick--she does things without half the\r\nconsideration other people do. And she likes to settle everything."\r\n\r\nBut happily the confiding friendship of a lifetime was too strong to be\r\neven harassed for a moment by the petulant suspicions of an angry girl.\r\n\r\n"My dear, if you were not vexed and anxious, I should tell you that you\r\nwere speaking very improperly of your aunt. I am perfectly satisfied\r\nthat she is doing what is right by dear Fred, as well as by me; and if I\r\nam satisfied, no one else has any right to object."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left for Henrietta in her present state of spirits but\r\nto have a hearty cry, one of the best possible ways she could find of\r\ndistressing her mother, who all the time was suffering infinitely more\r\nthan she could imagine from her fears, her efforts to silence them, and\r\nthe restraint which she was exercising upon herself, longing as she did\r\nto fly to her son\'s room, to see with her own eyes, and only detained by\r\nthe fear that her sudden appearance there might agitate him. The\r\ntears, whatever might be their effect upon her, did Henrietta good, and\r\nrestored her to something more like her proper senses. She grew rather\r\nalarmed, too, when she saw her mamma\'s pale looks, as she leant back\r\nalmost exhausted with anxiety and repressed agitation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Langford came up to bring them some tea, and she, having little\r\nidea of the real state of things, took so encouraging a view as to cheer\r\nthem both, and her visit did much service at least to Henrietta. Then\r\nthey heard sounds announcing Philip Carey\'s arrival, and presently after\r\nin came Bennet with a message from Mr. Frederick that he was better, and\r\nthat his mother was not to be frightened. At last came Aunt Geoffrey,\r\nsaying, "Well, Mary, he is better. I have been very sorry to leave you\r\nso long, and I believe Henrietta," looking at her with a smile, "thinks\r\nI have used you very ill."\r\n\r\n"I believe she did," said her mother, "but I was sure you would do\r\nright; you say he is better? Let me hear."\r\n\r\n"Much better; only--. But Mary, you look quite worn out, you should go\r\nto bed."\r\n\r\n"Let me hear about him first."\r\n\r\nAunt Geoffrey accordingly told the whole history, as, perhaps, every one\r\nwould not have told it, for one portion of it in some degree justified\r\nHenrietta\'s opinion that she had been doing a great deal on her own\r\nresponsibility. It had been very difficult to stop the bleeding, and\r\nFred, already very weak, had been so faint and exhausted that she had\r\nfelt considerable alarm, and was much rejoiced by the arrival of Philip\r\nCarey, who had not been at home when the messenger reached his house.\r\nNow, however, all was well; he had fully approved all that she had done,\r\nand, although she did not repeat this to Mrs. Frederick Langford,\r\nhad pronounced that her promptitude and energy had probably saved the\r\npatient\'s life. Fred, greatly relieved, had fallen asleep, and she had\r\nnow come, with almost an equal sense of relief, to tell his mother all\r\nthat had passed, and ask her pardon.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Beatrice, what do you mean by that? Is it not what you and\r\nGeoffrey have always done to treat him as your own son instead of mine?\r\nand is it not almost my chief happiness to feel assured that you always\r\nwill do so? You know that is the reason I never thank you."\r\n\r\nHenrietta hung her head, and felt that she had been very unjust and\r\nungrateful, more especially when her aunt said, "You thought it very\r\nhard to have your mouth stopped, Henrietta, my dear, and I was sorry for\r\nit, but I had not much time to be polite."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry I was in the way," said she, an acknowledgment such as she\r\nhad seldom made.\r\n\r\nFred awoke the next morning much better, though greatly fallen back in\r\nhis progress towards recovery, but his mother had during the night the\r\nworst fit of spasms from which she had ever suffered.\r\n\r\nBut Henrietta thought it all so well accounted for by all the agitations\r\nof the evening before, that there was no reason for further anxiety.\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort to Aunt Geoffrey, who took it rather more seriously,\r\nthat she received that morning a letter from her husband, concluding,\r\n\r\n"As to the Queen Bee, I have no doubt that you can judge of her frame\r\nbetter from the tone of her letters than from anything I have to tell.\r\nI think her essentially improved and improving, and you will think I\r\ndo not speak without warrant, when I tell you that Lady Susan expressed\r\nherself quite warmly respecting her this morning. She continues to\r\nimagine that she has the charge of Queen Bee, and not Queen Bee of her,\r\nand I think it much that she has been allowed to continue in the belief.\r\nLady Amelia comes to-morrow, and then I hope the poor little woman\'s\r\npenance may be over, for though she makes no complaints, there is no\r\ndoubt that it is a heavy one, as her thorough enjoyment of a book, and\r\nan hour\'s freedom from that little gossiping flow of plaintive talk\r\nsufficiently testify."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederick had lost much ground, and yet on the whole his relapse was of\r\nno slight service to him. In the earlier part of his illness he had been\r\nso stupefied by the accident, that he had neither been conscious of his\r\ndanger, nor was able to preserve any distinct remembrance of what he\r\nhad suffered. But this return to his former state, with all his senses\r\nperfect, made him realise the rest, and begin to perceive how near to\r\nthe grave he had been brought. A deep shuddering sense of awe came over\r\nhim, as he thought what it would have been to die then, without a minute\r\nof clear recollection, and his last act one of wilful disobedience. And\r\nhow had he requited the mercy which had spared him? He had shown as much\r\nof that same spirit of self-will as his feebleness would permit; he had\r\nbeen exacting, discontented, rebellious, and well indeed had he deserved\r\nto be cut off in the midst of the sin in which he had persisted.\r\n\r\nHe was too weak to talk, but his mind was wide awake; and many an\r\nearnest thanksgiving, and resolution strengthened by prayer, were made\r\nin silence during the two or three days that passed, partly in such\r\nthoughts as these, and for many hours more in sleep; while sometimes\r\nhis aunt, sometimes his sister, and sometimes even Bennet, sat by his\r\nbed-side unchidden for not being "mamma."\r\n\r\n"Above all," said he to himself, "he would for the future devote\r\nhimself, to make up to her for all that he had caused her to suffer for\r\nhis sake. Even if he were never to mount a horse or fire a gun for the\r\nrest of his life, what would such a sacrifice be for such a mother?" It\r\nwas very disappointing that, at present, all he could even attempt to do\r\nfor her was to send her messages--and affection does not travel well by\r\nmessage,--and at the same time to show submission to her known\r\nwishes. And after all, it would have been difficult not to have shown\r\nsubmission, for Aunt Geoffrey, as he already felt, was not a person to\r\nbe argued with, but to be obeyed; and for very shame he could not have\r\nindulged himself in his Philippics after the proof he had experienced of\r\ntheir futility.\r\n\r\nSo, partly on principle, and partly from necessity, he ceased to\r\ngrumble, and from that time forth it was wonderful how much less\r\nunpleasant even external things appeared, and how much his health\r\nbenefited by the tranquillity of spirits thus produced. He was willing\r\nto be pleased with all that was done with that intent; and as he grew\r\nbetter, it certainly was a strange variety with which he had to be\r\namused throughout the day. Very good naturedly he received all such\r\ncivilities, especially when Willy brought him a bottle of the first live\r\nsticklebacks of the season, accompanied by a message from Arthur that he\r\nhoped soon to send him a basin of tame tadpoles,--and when John rushed\r\nup with a basket of blind young black satin puppies, their mother\r\nfollowing in a state of agitation only equalled by that of Mrs. Langford\r\nand Judith.\r\n\r\nWilly, a nice intelligent little fellow, grew very fond of him, and\r\nspent much time with him, taking delight in his books and prints, beyond\r\nwhat could have been thought possible in one of the Sutton Leigh party.\r\n\r\nWhen he was strong enough to guide a pencil or pen, a very enjoyable\r\ncorrespondence commenced between him and his mother, who was still\r\nunable to leave her apartment; and hardly any one ever passed between\r\nthe two rooms without being the bearer of some playful greeting, or\r\ndroll descriptions of the present scene and occupation, chronicles of\r\nthe fashionable arrivals of the white clouds before the window, of\r\na bunch of violets, or a new book; the fashionable departure of the\r\nheadache, the fire, or a robin; notices that tom-tits were whetting\r\ntheir saws on the next tree, or of the domestic proceedings of the rooks\r\nwho were building their house opposite to Mrs. Frederick Langford\'s\r\nwindow, and whom she watched so much that she was said to be in a fair\r\nway of solving the problem of how many sticks go to a crow\'s nest;\r\ncriticisms of the books read by each party, and very often a reference\r\nto that celebrated billet, unfortunately delivered over night to Prince\r\nTalleyrand, informing him that his devoted friend had scarcely closed\r\nher eyes all night, and then only to dream of him!\r\n\r\nHenrietta grew very happy. She had her brother again, as wholly hers\r\nas in their younger days,--depending upon her, participating in all her\r\npleasures, or rather giving her favourite occupations double zest,\r\nby their being for him, for his amusement. She rode and walked in the\r\nbeautiful open spring country with grandpapa, to whom she was a most\r\nvaluable companion; and on her return she had two to visit, both of whom\r\nlooked forward with keen interest and delight to hearing her histories\r\nof down and wood, of field and valley, of farm-house, cottage, or\r\nschool; had a laugh for the least amusing circumstance, admiration\r\nfor the spring flower or leaf, and power to follow her descriptions of\r\nbudding woods, soft rising hills, and gorgeous sunsets. How her mamma\r\nenjoyed comparing notes with her about those same woods and dells, and\r\nwould describe the adventures of her own youth! And now it might be\r\nnoticed that she did not avoid speaking of those in which Henrietta\'s\r\nfather had been engaged; nay, she dwelt on them by preference, and\r\nwithout the suppressed sigh which had formerly followed anything like\r\na reference to him. Sometimes she would smile to identify the bold open\r\ndown with the same where she had run races with him, and even laugh to\r\nthink of the droll adventures. Sometimes the shady woodland walk would\r\nmake her describe their nutting parties, or it would bring her thoughts\r\nto some fit of childish mischief and concealment, and to the confession\r\nto which his bolder and more upright counsel had at length led her.\r\nOr she would tell of the long walks they had taken together when older\r\ngrown, when each had become prime counsellor and confidante of the\r\nother; and the interests and troubles of home and of school were poured\r\nout to willing ears, and sympathy and advice exchanged. How Fred and\r\nMary had been companions from the very first, how their love had grown\r\nup unconsciously, in the sports in the sunny fields, shady coombs, and\r\ngreen woods of their home: how it had strengthened and ripened with\r\nadvancing years, and how bright and unclouded their sunshine had been\r\nto dwell on: this was her delight, while the sadness which once spoke of\r\ncrushed hopes, and lost happiness, had gone from her smile. It was as if\r\nshe still felt herself walking in the light of his love, and at the same\r\ntime, as if she wished to show him to his daughter as he was, and to\r\ntell Henrietta of those words and those ways of his which were most\r\ncharacteristic, and which used to be laid up so fast in her heart,\r\nthat she could never have borne to speak of them. The bitterness of his\r\ndeath, as it regarded herself, seemed to have passed, the brightness of\r\nhis memory alone remaining. Henrietta loved to listen, but scarcely so\r\nmuch as her mother loved to tell; and instead of agitating her, these\r\nrecollections always seemed to soothe and make her happy.\r\n\r\nHenrietta knew that Aunt Geoffrey and grandpapa were both of them\r\nanxious about her mother\'s health, but for her own part she did not\r\nthink her worse than she had often been before; and whilst she continued\r\nin nearly the same state, rose every day, sat in her arm-chair, and was\r\nso cheerful, and even lively, there could not be very much amiss, even\r\nthough there was no visible progress in amendment. Serious complaint\r\nthere was, as she knew of old, to cause the spasms; but it had existed\r\nso long, that after the first shock of being told of it two years ago,\r\nshe had almost ceased to think about it. She satisfied herself to her\r\nown mind that it could not, should not be progressing, and that this was\r\nonly a very slow recovery from the last attack.\r\n\r\nTime went on, and a shade began to come over Fred. He was bright and\r\nmerry when anything occurred to amuse him, did not like reading less, or\r\ntake less interest in his occupations; but in the intervals of quiet\r\nhe grew grave and almost melancholy, and his inquiries after his mother\r\ngrew minute and anxious.\r\n\r\n"Henrietta," said he, one day when they were alone together, "I was\r\ntrying to reckon how long it is since I have seen mamma."\r\n\r\n"O, I think she will come and see you in a few days more," said\r\nHenrietta.\r\n\r\n"You have told me that so many times," said Fred. "I think I must try to\r\nget to her. That passage, if it was not so very long! If Uncle Geoffrey\r\ncomes on Saturday, I am sure he can manage to take me there."\r\n\r\n"It will be a festival day indeed when you meet!" said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he thoughtfully. Then returning to the former subject, "But\r\nhow long is it, Henrietta? This is the twenty-seventh of March, is it\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; a whole quarter of a year you have been laid up here."\r\n\r\n"It was somewhere about the beginning of February that Uncle Geoffrey\r\nwent."\r\n\r\n"The fourth," said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"And it was three days after he went away that mamma had those first\r\nspasms. Henrietta, she has been six weeks ill!"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Henrietta, "you know she was five weeks without stirring\r\nout of the room, that last time she was ill at Rocksand, and she is\r\ngetting better."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it is getting better," said Fred. "You always say so, but\r\nI don\'t think you have anything to show for it."\r\n\r\n"You might say the same for yourself," said Henrietta, laughing. "You\r\nhave been getting better these three months, poor man, and you need not\r\nboast."\r\n\r\n"Well, at least I can show something for it," said Fred; "they allow\r\nme a lark\'s diet instead of a wren\'s, I can hold up my head like other\r\npeople now, and I actually made my own legs and the table\'s carry me\r\nto the window yesterday, which is what I call getting on. But I do not\r\nthink it is so with mamma. A fortnight ago she used to be up by ten or\r\neleven o\'clock; now I don\'t believe she ever is till one."\r\n\r\n"It has been close, damp weather," said Henrietta, surprised at the\r\naccurate remembrance, which she could not confute. "She misses the cold\r\nbracing wind."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it," said Fred, growing silent, and after a short interval\r\nbeginning again more earnestly, "Henrietta, neither you nor any one else\r\nare keeping anything from me, I trust?"\r\n\r\n"O, no, no!" said Henrietta, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"You are quite sure?"\r\n\r\n"Quite," responded she. "You know all I know, every bit; and I know all\r\nAunt Geoffrey does, I am sure I do, for she always tells me what Mr.\r\nPhilip Carey says. I have heard Uncle and Aunt Geoffrey both say strong\r\nthings about keeping people in the dark, and I am convinced they would\r\nnot do so."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they would," said Fred; "but I am not satisfied.\r\nRecollect and tell me clearly, are they convinced that this is only\r\nrecovering slowly--I do not mean that; I know too well that this is not\r\na thing to be got rid of; but do they think that she is going to be as\r\nwell as usual?"\r\n\r\n"I do," said Henrietta, "and you know I am more used to her illness than\r\nany of them. Bennet and I were agreeing to-day that, considering how\r\nbad the spasms were, and how much fatigue she had been going through, we\r\ncould not expect her to get on faster."\r\n\r\n"You do? But that is not Aunt Geoffrey."\r\n\r\n"O! Aunt Geoffrey is anxious, and expected her to get on faster, just\r\nlike Busy Bee expecting everything to be so quick; but I am sure\r\nyou could not get any more information from her than from me, and\r\nimpressions--I am sure you may trust mine, used as I am to watch mamma."\r\n\r\nFred asked no more; but it was observable that from that day he never\r\nlost one of his mother\'s little notes, placing them as soon as read in\r\nhis pocket-book, and treasuring them carefully. He also begged Henrietta\r\nto lend him a miniature of her mother, taken at the time of her\r\nmarriage. It represented her in all her youthful loveliness, with the\r\nlong ringlets and plaits of dark brown hair hanging on her neck, the\r\narch suppressed smile on her lips, and the laughing light in her deep\r\nblue eye. He looked at it for a little while, and then asked Henrietta\r\nif she thought that she could find, among the things sent from Rocksand\r\nwhich had not yet been unpacked, another portrait, taken in the earlier\r\nmonths of her widowhood, when she had in some partial degree recovered\r\nfrom her illness, but her life seemed still to hang on a thread. Mrs.\r\nVivian, at whose especial desire it had been taken, had been very fond\r\nof it, and had always kept it in her room, and Fred was very anxious to\r\nsee it again. After a long search, with Bennet\'s help, Henrietta found\r\nit, and brought it to him. Thin, wan, and in the deep black garments,\r\nthere was much more general resemblance to her present appearance in\r\nthis than in the portrait of the beautiful smiling bride. "And yet,"\r\nsaid Fred, as he compared them, "do not you think, Henrietta, that there\r\nis more of mamma in the first?"\r\n\r\n"I see what you mean," said Henrietta. "You know it is by a much better\r\nartist."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he, "the other is like enough in feature,--more so certainly\r\nto anything we have ever seen: but what a difference! And yet what is\r\nit? Look! Her eyes generally have something melancholy in their look,\r\nand yet I am sure those bright happy ones put me much more in mind of\r\nhers than these, looking so weighed down with sorrow. And the sweet\r\nsmile, that is quite her own!"\r\n\r\n"If you could but see her now, Fred," said Henrietta, "I think you would\r\nindeed say so. She has now and then a beautiful little pink flush, that\r\nlights up her eyes as well as her cheeks; and when she smiles and talks\r\nabout those old times with papa, she does really look just like the\r\nminiature, all but her thinness."\r\n\r\n"I do not half like to hear of all that talking about my father,"\r\nmurmured Fred to himself as he leant back. Henrietta at first opened her\r\neyes; then a sudden perception of his meaning flashed over her, and she\r\nbegan to speak of something else as fast as she could.\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey came on Saturday afternoon, and after paying a\r\nminute\'s visit to Fred, had a conference of more than an hour with his\r\nsister-in-law. Fred did not seem pleased with his sister\'s information\r\nthat "it was on business," and only was in a slight degree reassured by\r\nbeing put in mind that there was always something to settle at Lady-day.\r\nHenrietta thought her uncle looked grave; and as she was especially\r\nanxious to prevent either herself or Fred from being frightened, she\r\nwould not leave him alone in Fred\'s room, knowing full well that\r\nno questions would be asked except in private--none at least of the\r\ndescription which she dreaded.\r\n\r\nAll Fred attempted was the making his long-mediated request that he\r\nmight visit his mother, and Uncle Geoffrey undertook to see whether it\r\nwas possible. Numerous messages passed, and at length it was arranged\r\nthat on Sunday, just before afternoon service, when the house was quiet,\r\nhis uncle should help him to her room, where his aunt would read to them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nFrederick made quite a preparation for what was to him a great\r\nundertaking. He sat counting the hours all the morning; and when at\r\nlength the time arrived, his heart beat so violently, that it seemed to\r\ntake away all the little strength he had. His uncle came in, but waited\r\na few moments; then said, with some hesitation, "Fred, you must be\r\nprepared to see her a good deal altered."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Fred, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"And take the greatest care not to agitate her. Can you be trusted? I do\r\nnot ask it for your own sake."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Fred, resolutely.\r\n\r\n"Then come."\r\n\r\nAnd in process of time Fred was at her door. There he quitted his\r\nuncle\'s arm, and came forward alone to the large easy chair where she\r\nsat by the fire-side. She started joyfully forward, and soon he was on\r\none knee before her, her arms round his neck, her tears dropping on\r\nhis face, and a quiet sense of excessive happiness felt by both. Then\r\nrising, he sank back into another great chair, which his sister had\r\narranged for him close to hers, and too much out of breath to speak, he\r\npassively let Henrietta make him comfortable there; while holding his\r\nmother\'s hand, he kept his eyes fixed upon her, and she, anxious only\r\nfor him, patted his cushions, offered her own, and pushed her footstool\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\nA few words passed between Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Langford outside the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"I still think it a great risk," said she.\r\n\r\n"But I should not feel justified in preventing it," was his answer,\r\n"only do not leave them long alone." Then opening the door he called,\r\n"Henrietta, there is the last bell." And Henrietta, much against her\r\nwill, was obliged to go with him to Church.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, my dear," said her mother. "Think of us prisoners in the\r\nright way at Church, and not in the wrong one."\r\n\r\nStrangely came the sound of the Church bell to their ears through the\r\nwindow, half open to admit the breezy breath of spring; the cawing of\r\nthe rooks and the song of the blackbird came with it; the sky was clear\r\nand blue, the buds were bursting into life.\r\n\r\n"How very lovely it is!" added she.\r\n\r\nFred made a brief reply, but without turning his head to the window. His\r\neyes, his thoughts, his whole soul, were full of the contemplation of\r\nwhat was to him a thousand times more lovely,--that frail wasted form,\r\nnamely, whose hand he held. The delicate pink colour which Henrietta had\r\ndescribed was on her cheek, contrasting with the ivory whiteness of the\r\nrest of her face; the blue eyes shone with a sweet subdued brightness\r\nunder their long black lashes; the lips smiled, though languidly yet as\r\nsunnily as ever; the dark hair lay in wavy lines along the sides of her\r\nface; and but for the helplessness with which the figure rested in the\r\nchair, there was less outward token of suffering than he had often seen\r\nabout her,--more appearance almost of youth and beauty. But it was not\r\nan earthly beauty; there was something about it which filled him with\r\na kind of indescribable undefined awe, together with dread of a sorrow\r\ntowards which he shrank from looking. She thought him fatigued with the\r\nexertion he had made, and allowed him to rest, while she contemplated\r\nwith pleasure even the slight advances which he had already made in\r\nshaking off the traces of illness.\r\n\r\nThe silence was not broken till Aunt Geoffrey came in, just as the last\r\nstroke of the Church-bell died away, bringing in her hand a fragrant\r\nspray of the budding sweet-briar.\r\n\r\n"The bees are coming out with you, Freddy," said she. "I have just been\r\nround the garden watching them revelling in the crocuses."\r\n\r\n"How delicious!" said Mrs. Frederick Langford, to whom she had offered\r\nthe sweet-briar. "Give it to him, poor fellow; he is quite knocked up\r\nwith his journey."\r\n\r\n"O no, not in the least, mamma, thank you," said Fred, sitting up\r\nvigorously; "you do not know how strong I am growing." And then turning\r\nto the window, he made an effort, and began observing on her rook\'s\r\nnest, as she called it, and her lilac buds. Then came a few more\r\ncheerful questions and comments on the late notes, and then Mrs.\r\nFrederick Langford proposed that the reading of the service should\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nAunt Geoffrey, kneeling at the table, read the prayers, and Fred took\r\nthe alternate verses of the Psalms. It was the last day of the month,\r\nand as he now and then raised his eyes to his mother\'s face, he saw\r\nher lips follow the glorious responses in those psalms of praise, and a\r\nglistening in her lifted eyes such as he could never forget.\r\n\r\n"He healeth those that are broken in heart, and giveth medicine to heal\r\ntheir sickness."\r\n\r\n"He telleth the number of the stars, and calleth them all by their\r\nnames."\r\n\r\nHe read this verse as he had done many a time before, without thinking\r\nof the exceeding beauty of the manner in which it is connected with the\r\nformer one; but in after years he never read it again without that whole\r\nroom rising before his eyes, and above all his mother\'s face. It was a\r\nsweet soft light, and not a gloom, that rested round that scene in his\r\nmemory; springtide sights and sounds; the beams of the declining sun,\r\nwith its quiet spring radiance; the fresh mild air; even the bright\r\nfire, and the general look of calm cheerfulness which pervaded all\r\naround, all conduced to that impression which never left him.\r\n\r\nThe service ended, Aunt Geoffrey read the hymn for the day in the\r\n"Christian Year," and then left them for a few minutes; but strange as\r\nit may seem, those likewise were spent in silence, and though there\r\nwas some conversation when she returned, Fred took little share in it.\r\nSilent as he was, he could hardly believe that he had been there more\r\nthan ten minutes, when sounds were heard of the rest of the family\r\nreturning from Church, and Mrs. Geoffrey Langford went down to meet\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn another instant Henrietta came up, very bright and joyous, with many\r\nkind messages from Aunt Roger. Next came Uncle Geoffrey, who, after a\r\nfew cheerful observations on the beauty of the day, to which his sister\r\nresponded with pleasure, said, "Now, Freddy, I must be hard-hearted; I\r\nam coming back almost directly to carry you off."\r\n\r\n"So soon!" exclaimed Henrietta. "Am I to be cheated of all the pleasure\r\nof seeing you together?"\r\n\r\nNo one seemed to attend to her; but as soon as the door had closed\r\nbehind his uncle, Fred moved as if to speak, paused, hesitated, then\r\nbent forward, and, shading his face with his hand, said in a low voice,\r\n"Mamma, say you forgive me."\r\n\r\nShe held out her arm, and again he sank on his knee, resting his head\r\nagainst her.\r\n\r\n"My own dear boy," said she, "I will not say I have nothing to forgive,\r\nfor that I know is not what you want; but well do you know how freely\r\nforgiven and forgotten is all that you may ever feel to have been\r\nagainst my wish. God bless you, my own dear Frederick!" she added,\r\npressing her hand upon his head. "His choicest blessings be with you\r\nforever."\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey\'s knock was heard; Frederick hastily rose to his feet,\r\nwas folded in one more long embrace, then, without another word,\r\nsuffered his uncle to lead him out of the room, and support him back to\r\nhis own. He stretched himself on the sofa, turned his face inwards,\r\nand gave two or three long gasping sighs, as if completely overpowered,\r\nthough his uncle could scarcely determine whether by grief or by\r\nphysical exhaustion.\r\n\r\nHenrietta looked frightened, but her uncle made her a sign to say\r\nnothing: and after watching him anxiously for some minutes, during which\r\nhe remained perfectly still, her uncle left the room, and she sat down\r\nto watch for him, taking up a book, for she dreaded the reveries in\r\nwhich she had once been so prone to indulge. Fred remained for a long\r\ntime tranquil, if not asleep; and when at length he was disturbed,\r\ncomplained that his head ached, and seemed chiefly anxious to be left in\r\nquiet. It might be that, in addition to his great weariness, he felt\r\na charm upon him which he could not bear to break. At any rate, he\r\nscarcely looked up or spoke all the rest of the evening, excepting that,\r\nwhen he went to bed, he sent a message that he hoped Uncle Geoffrey\r\nwould come to his room the next morning before setting off, as he was\r\nobliged to do at a very early hour.\r\n\r\nHe came, and found Fred awake, looking white and heavy-eyed, as if he\r\nhad slept little, and allowing that his head still ached.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Geoffrey," said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking at\r\nhim earnestly, "would it be of no use to have further advice?"\r\n\r\nHis uncle understood him, and answered, "I hope that Dr. ---- will come\r\nthis evening or to-morrow morning. But," added he, slowly and kindly,\r\n"you must not build your hopes upon that, Fred. It is more from the\r\nfeeling that nothing should be untried, than from the expectation that\r\nhe can be of use."\r\n\r\n"Then there is no hope?" said Fred, with a strange quietness.\r\n\r\n"Man can do nothing," answered his uncle. "You know how the case stands;\r\nthe complaint cannot be reached, and there is scarcely a probability of\r\nits becoming inactive. It may be an affair of days or weeks, or she may\r\nyet rally, and be spared to us for some time longer."\r\n\r\n"If I could but think so!" said Fred. "But I cannot. Her face will not\r\nlet me hope."\r\n\r\n"If ever a ray from heaven shone out upon a departing saint," said\r\nUncle Geoffrey,--but he could not finish the sentence, and turning away,\r\nwalked to the window.\r\n\r\n"And you must go?" said Fred, when he came back to his side again.\r\n\r\n"I must," said Uncle Geoffrey. "Nothing but the most absolute necessity\r\ncould make me leave you now. I scarcely could feel myself an honest man\r\nif I was not in my place to-morrow. I shall be here again on Thursday,\r\nat latest, and bring Beatrice. Your mother thinks she may be a comfort\r\nto Henrietta."\r\n\r\n"Henrietta knows all this?" asked Fred.\r\n\r\n"As far as she will bear to believe it," said his uncle. "We cannot\r\ngrudge her her unconsciousness, but I am afraid it will be worse for\r\nher in the end. You must nerve yourself, Fred, to support her. Now,\r\ngood-bye, and may God bless and strengthen you in your trial!"\r\n\r\nFred was left alone again to the agony of the bitterest thoughts he had\r\never known. All his designs of devoting himself to her at an end! Her\r\nwhom he loved with such an intensity of enthusiastic admiration and\r\nreverence,--the gentlest, the most affectionate, the most beautiful\r\nbeing he knew! Who would ever care for him as she did? To whom would\r\nit matter now whether he was in danger or in safety? whether he\r\ndistinguished himself or not? And how thoughtlessly had he trifled with\r\nher comfort, for the mere pleasure of a moment, and even fancied himself\r\njustified in doing so! Even her present illness, had it not probably\r\nbeen brought on by her anxiety and attendance on him? and it was his own\r\nwilful disobedience to which all might be traced. It was no wonder that,\r\npassing from one such miserable thought to another, his bodily weakness\r\nwas considerably increased, and he remained very languid and unwell;\r\nso much so that had Philip Carey ever presumed to question anything\r\nMr. Geoffrey Langford thought fit to do, he would have pronounced\r\nyesterday\'s visit a most imprudent measure. In the afternoon, as Fred\r\nwas lying on his sofa, he heard a foot on the stairs, and going along\r\nthe passage.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" said he; "the new doctor already? It is a strange step."\r\n\r\n"O! Fred, don\'t be the fairy Fine Ear, as you used to be when you were\r\nat the worst," said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"But do you know who it is?" said Fred.\r\n\r\n"It is Mr. Franklin," said Henrietta. "You know mamma has only been once\r\nat Church since your accident, and then there was no Holy Communion. So\r\nyou must not fancy she is worse, Fred."\r\n\r\n"I wish we were confirmed," said Fred, sighing, and presently adding,\r\n"My Prayer-Book, if you please, Henrietta."\r\n\r\n"You will only make your head worse, with trying to read the small\r\nprint," said she; "I will read anything you want to you."\r\n\r\nHe chose nevertheless to have it himself, and when he next spoke, it was\r\nto say, "I wish, when Mr. Franklin leaves her, you would ask him to come\r\nto me."\r\n\r\nHenrietta did not like the proposal at all, and said all she could\r\nagainst it; but Fred persisted, and made her at last undertake to ask\r\nAunt Geoffrey\'s consent. Even then she would have done her best to miss\r\nthe opportunity; but Fred heard the first sounds, and she was obliged to\r\nfetch Mr. Franklin. The conference was not long, and she found no\r\nreason to regret that it had taken place; for Fred did not seem so much\r\noppressed and weighted down when she again returned to him.\r\n\r\nThe physician who had been sent for arrived. He had seen Mrs. Frederick\r\nLangford some years before, and well understood her case, and his\r\nopinion was now exactly what Fred had been prepared by his uncle to\r\nexpect. It was impossible to conjecture how long she might yet survive:\r\nanother attack might come at any moment, and be the last. It might be\r\ndeferred for weeks or months, or even now it was possible that she might\r\nrally, and return to her usual state of health.\r\n\r\nIt was on this possibility, or as she chose to hear the word,\r\nprobability, that Henrietta fixed her whole mind. The rest was to her as\r\nif unsaid; she would not hear nor believe it, and shunned anything that\r\nbrought the least impression of the kind. The only occasion when she\r\nwould avow her fears even to herself, was when she knelt in prayer; and\r\nthen how wild and unsubmissive were her petitions! How embittered and\r\nwretched she would feel at her own powerlessness! Then the next minute\r\nshe would drive off her fears as by force; call up a vision of a\r\nbrightly smiling future; think, speak, and act as if hiding her eyes\r\nwould prevent the approach of the enemy she dreaded.\r\n\r\nHer grandmamma was as determined as herself to hope; and her grandpapa,\r\nthough fully alive to the real state of the case, could not bear to\r\nsadden her before the time, and let her talk on and build schemes for\r\nthe future, till he himself almost caught a glance of her hopes, and his\r\ndeep sigh was the only warning she received from him. Fred, too weak for\r\nmuch argument, and not unwilling to rejoice now and then in an illusion,\r\nwas easily silenced, and Aunt Geoffrey had no time for anyone but the\r\npatient. Her whole thought, almost her whole being, was devoted to\r\n"Mary," the friend, the sister of her childhood, whom she now attended\r\nupon with something of the reverent devotedness with which an angel\r\nmight be watched and served, were it to make a brief sojourn upon earth;\r\nfeeling it a privilege each day that she was still permitted to attend\r\nher, and watching for each passing word and expression as a treasure to\r\nbe dwelt on in many a subsequent year.\r\n\r\nIt could not be thus with Henrietta, bent on seeing no illness, on\r\nmarking no traces of danger; shutting her eyes to all the tokens that\r\nher mother was not to be bound down to earth for ever. She found her\r\nalways cheerful, ready to take interest in all that pleased her, and\r\nstill with the playfulness which never failed to light up all that\r\napproached her. A flower,--what pleasure it gave her! and how sweet her\r\nsmile would be!\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening of the day after the physician\'s visit, that\r\nHenrietta came in talking, with the purpose of, as she fancied, cheering\r\nher mother\'s spirits, of some double lilac primroses which Mrs. Langford\r\nhad promised her for the garden at the Pleasance. Her mamma smelt the\r\nflowers, admired them, and smiled as she said, "Your papa planted a root\r\nof those in my little garden the first summer I was here."\r\n\r\n"Then I am sure you will like to have them at the Pleasance, mamma."\r\n\r\n"My dear child,"--she paused, while Henrietta started, and gazed upon\r\nher, frightened at the manner--"you must not build upon our favourite\r\nold plan; you must prepare--"\r\n\r\n"O but, mamma, you are better! You are so much better than two days ago;\r\nand these clear days do you so much good; and it is all so bright."\r\n\r\n"Thanks to Him Who has made it bright!" said her mother, taking her\r\nhand. "But I fear, my own dearest, that it will seem far otherwise to\r\nyou. I want you to make up your mind--"\r\n\r\nHenrietta broke vehemently upon the feeble accents. "Mamma! mamma!\r\nyou must not speak so! It is the worst thing people can do to think\r\ndespondingly of themselves. Aunt Geoffrey, do tell her so!"\r\n\r\n"Despondingly! my child; you little know what the thought is to me!"\r\n\r\nThe words were almost whispered, and Henrietta scarcely marked them.\r\n\r\n"No, no, you must not! It is too cruel to me,--I can\'t bear it!" she\r\ncried; the tears in her eyes, and a violence of agitation about her,\r\nwhich her mother, feeble as she was, could not attempt to contend\r\nwith. She rested her head on her cushions, and silently and mournfully\r\nfollowed with her eyes the hasty trembling movements of her daughter,\r\nwho continued to arrange the things on the table, and make desperate\r\nattempts to regain her composure; but completely failing, caught up her\r\nbonnet, and hurried out of the room.\r\n\r\n"Poor dear child," said Mrs. Frederick Langford, "I wish she was more\r\nprepared. Beatrice, the comforting her is the dearest and saddest task I\r\nleave you. Fred, poor fellow, is prepared, and will bear up like a man;\r\nbut it will come fearfully upon her. And Henrietta and I have been more\r\nlike sisters than mother and daughter. If she would only bear to hear\r\nme--but no, if I were to be overcome while speaking to her, it might\r\ngive her pain in the recollection. Beatrice, you must tell her all I\r\nwould say."\r\n\r\n"If I could!"\r\n\r\n"You must tell her, Beatrice, that I was as undisciplined as she is now.\r\nTell her how I have come to rejoice in the great affliction of my life:\r\nhow little I knew how to bear it when Frederick was taken from me and\r\nhis children, in the prime of his health and strength. You remember how\r\ncrushed to the ground I was, and how it was said that my life was saved\r\nchiefly by the calmness that came with the full belief that I was dying.\r\nAnd O! how my spirit rebelled when I found myself recovering! Do you\r\nremember the first day I went to Church to return thanks?"\r\n\r\n"It was after we were gone home."\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes. I had put it off longer than I ought, because I felt so\r\nutterly unable to join in the service. The sickness of heart that came\r\nwith those verses of thanksgiving! All I could do was to pray to be\r\nforgiven for not being able to follow them. Now I can own with all\r\nmy heart the mercy that would not grant my blind wish for death. My\r\ntreasure was indeed in heaven, but O! it was not the treasure that was\r\nmeant. I was forgetting my mother, and so selfish and untamed was\r\nI, that I was almost forgetting my poor babies! Yes, tell her this,\r\nBeatrice, and tell her that, if duties and happiness sprang up all\r\naround me, forlorn and desolate as I thought myself, so much the more\r\nwill they for her; and \'at evening time there shall be light.\' Tell her\r\nthat I look to her for guiding and influencing Fred. She must never\r\nlet a week pass without writing to him, and she must have the honoured\r\noffice of waiting on the old age of her grandfather and grandmother. I\r\nthink she will be a comfort to them, do not you? They are fond of her,\r\nand she seems to suit them."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have little doubt that she will be everything to them. I have\r\nespecially noted her ways with Mrs. Langford, they are so exactly what I\r\nhave tried to teach Beatrice."\r\n\r\n"Dear little Busy Bee! I am glad she is coming; but in case I should\r\nnot see her, give her her godmother\'s love, and tell her that she and\r\nHenrietta must be what their mammas have been to each other; and that I\r\ntrust that after thirty-five years\' friendship, they will still have as\r\nmuch confidence in one another as I have in you, my own dear Beatrice.\r\nI have written her name in one of these books," she added after a short\r\ninterval, touching some which were always close to her. "And, Beatrice,\r\none thing more I had to say," she proceeded, taking up a Bible, and\r\nfinding out a place in it. "Geoffrey has always been a happy prosperous\r\nman, as he well deserves; but if ever trouble should come to him in his\r\nturn, then show him this." She pointed out the verse, "Be as a father to\r\nthe fatherless, and instead of a husband to their mother; so shalt thou\r\nbe as the son of the Most High, and He shall love thee more than thy\r\nmother doth." "Show him that, and tell him it is his sister Mary\'s last\r\nblessing."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning, Henrietta began to awake from her sound night\'s\r\nrest. Was it a dream that she saw a head between her and the window? She\r\nthought it was, and turned to sleep again; but at her movement the head\r\nturned, the figure advanced, and Mrs. Geoffrey Langford stood over her.\r\n\r\nHenrietta opened her eyes, and gazed upon her without saying a word for\r\nsome moments; then, as her senses awakened, she half sprung up. "How is\r\nmamma? Does she want me? Why?" Her aunt made an effort to speak, but it\r\nseemed beyond her power.\r\n\r\n"O, aunt, aunt!" cried she, "what is the matter? What has happened?\r\nSpeak to me!"\r\n\r\n"Henrietta," said her aunt, in a low, calm, but hoarse tone, "she bade\r\nyou bear up for your brother\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"But--but--" said Henrietta, breathlessly; "and she--"\r\n\r\n"My dear child, she is at rest."\r\n\r\nHenrietta laid her head back, as if completely stunned, and unable to\r\nrealise what she had heard.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," she said, after a few moments.\r\n\r\nHer aunt knelt by her and steadily, without a tear, began to speak.\r\n"It was at half-past twelve; she had been asleep some little time very\r\nquietly. I was just going to lie down on the sofa, when I thought her\r\nface looked different, and stood watching. She woke, said she felt\r\noppressed, and asked me to raise her pillows. While she was leaning\r\nagainst my arm, there was a spasm, a shiver, and she was gone! Yes, we\r\nmust only think of her as in perfect peace!"\r\n\r\nHenrietta lay motionless for some moments, then at last broke out with a\r\nsort of anger, "O, why did you not call me?"\r\n\r\n"There was not one instant, my dear, and I could not ring, for fear of\r\ndisturbing Fred. I could not call any one till it was too late."\r\n\r\n"O, why was I not there? I would--I would--she must have heard me.\r\nI would not have let her go. O, mamma!" cried Henrietta, almost\r\nunconscious of what she said, and bursting into a transport of\r\nungovernable grief; sobbing violently and uttering wild incoherent\r\nexclamations. Her aunt tried in vain to soothe her by kind words, but\r\nall she said seemed only to add impulse to the torrent; and at last she\r\nfound herself obliged to wait till the violence of the passion had in\r\nsome degree exhausted itself; and young, strong, and undisciplined as\r\npoor Henrietta was, this was not quickly. At last, however, the sobs\r\ngrew less loud, and the exclamations less vehement. Aunt Geoffrey\r\nthought she could be heard, leant down over her, kissed her, and said,\r\n"Now we must pray that we may fulfil her last desire; bear it patiently,\r\nand try to help your brother."\r\n\r\n"Fred, O poor Fred!" and she seemed on the point of another burst of\r\nlamentation, but her aunt went on speaking--"I must go to him; he\r\nhas yet to hear it, and you had better come to him as soon as you are\r\ndressed."\r\n\r\n"O aunt; I could not bear to see him. It will kill him, I know it will!\r\nO no, no, I cannot, cannot see Fred! O, mamma, mamma!" A fresh fit of\r\nweeping succeeded, and Mrs. Langford herself feeling most deeply, was in\r\ngreat doubt and perplexity; she did not like to leave Henrietta in this\r\ncondition, and yet there was an absolute necessity that she should go\r\nto poor Fred, before any chance accident or mischance should reveal the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n"I must leave you, my dear," said she, at last. "Think how your dear\r\nmother bowed her head to His will. Pray to your Father in Heaven, Who\r\nalone can comfort you. I must go to your brother, and when I return, I\r\nhope you will be more composed."\r\n\r\nThe pain of witnessing the passionate sorrow of Henrietta was no good\r\npreparation for carrying the same tidings to one, whose bodily weakness\r\nmade it to be feared that he might suffer even more; but Mrs. Geoffrey\r\nLangford feared to lose her composure by stopping to reflect, and\r\nhastened down from Henrietta\'s room with a hurried step.\r\n\r\nShe knocked at Fred\'s door, and was answered by his voice. As she\r\nentered he looked at her with anxious eyes, and before she could speak,\r\nsaid, "I know what you are come to tell me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Fred," said she; "but how?"\r\n\r\n"I was sure of it," said Fred. "I knew I should never see her again; and\r\nthere were sounds this morning. Did not I hear poor Henrietta crying?"\r\n\r\n"She has been crying very much," said his aunt.\r\n\r\n"Ah! she would never believe it," said Fred. "But after last Sunday--O,\r\nno one could look at that face, and think she was to stay here any\r\nlonger!"\r\n\r\n"We could not wish it for her sake," said his aunt, for the first time\r\nfeeling almost overcome.\r\n\r\n"Let me hear how it was," said Frederick, after a pause.\r\n\r\nHis aunt repeated what she had before told Henrietta, and then he asked\r\nquickly, "What did you do? I did not hear you ring."\r\n\r\n"No, that was what I was afraid of. I was going to call some one, when I\r\nmet grandpapa, who was just going up. He came with me, and--and was very\r\nkind--then he sent me to lie down; but I could not sleep, and went to\r\nwait for Henrietta\'s waking."\r\n\r\nFred gave a long, deep, heavy sigh, and said, "Poor Henrietta! Is she\r\nvery much overcome?"\r\n\r\n"So much, that I hardly know how to leave her."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stay with me, then, Aunt Geoffrey. It is very kind in you, but\r\nI don\'t think anything is much good to me." He hid his face as he spoke\r\nthus, in a tone of the deepest dejection.\r\n\r\n"Nothing but prayer, my dear Fred," said she, gently. "Then I will go to\r\nyour sister again."\r\n\r\n"Thank you." And she had reached the door when he asked, "When does\r\nUncle Geoffrey come?"\r\n\r\n"By the four o\'clock train," she answered, and moved on.\r\n\r\nFrederick hid his head under the clothes, and gave way to a burst of\r\nagony, which, silent as it was, was even more intense than his sister\'s.\r\nO! the blank that life seemed without her look, her voice, her tone! the\r\nfrightful certainty that he should never see her more! Then it would for\r\na moment seem utterly incredible that she should thus have passed away;\r\nbut then returned the conviction, and he felt as if he could not even\r\nexist under it. But this excessive oppression and consciousness of\r\nmisery seemed chiefly to come upon him when alone. In the presence of\r\nanother person he could talk in the same quiet matter-of-fact way in\r\nwhich he had already done to his aunt; and the blow itself, sudden as it\r\nwas, did not affect his health as the first anticipation of it had done.\r\nWith Henrietta things were quite otherwise. When alone she was quiet, in\r\na sort of stupor, in which she scarcely even thought; but the entrance\r\nof any person into her room threw her into a fresh paroxysm of grief,\r\never increasing in vehemence; then she was quieted a little, and was\r\nleft to herself, but she could not, or would not, turn where alone\r\ncomfort could be found, and repelled, almost as if it was an insult to\r\nher affection, any entreaty that she would even try to be comforted.\r\nAbove all, in the perverse-ness of her undisciplined affliction, she\r\npersisted in refusing to see her brother. "She should do him harm," she\r\nsaid. "No, it was utterly impossible for her to control herself so as\r\nnot to do him harm." And thereupon her sobs and tears redoubled. She\r\nwould not touch a morsel of food; she would not consent to leave her bed\r\nwhen asked to do so, though ten minutes after, in the restlessness\r\nof her misery, she was found walking up and down her room in her\r\ndressing-gown.\r\n\r\nNever had Mrs. Geoffrey Langford known a more trying day. Old Mr.\r\nLangford, who had loved "Mary" like his own child, did indeed bear\r\nup under the affliction with all his own noble spirit of Christian\r\nsubmission; but, excepting by his sympathy, he could be of little\r\nassistance to her in the many painful offices which fell to her share.\r\nMrs. Langford walked about the house, active as ever; now sitting down\r\nin her chair, and bursting into a flood of tears for "poor Mary," or\r\n"dear Frederick," all the sorrow for whose loss seemed renewed; then\r\nrising vigorously, saying, "Well, it is His will; it is all for the\r\nbest!" and hastening away to see how Henrietta and Fred were, to make\r\nsome arrangement about mourning, or to get Geoffrey\'s room ready for\r\nhim. And in all these occupations she wanted Beatrice to consult, or to\r\nsympathise, or to promise that Geoffrey would like and approve what she\r\ndid. In the course of the morning Mr. and Mrs. Roger Langford came from\r\nSutton Leigh, and the latter, by taking the charge of, talking to, and\r\nassisting Mrs. Langford, greatly relieved her sister-in-law. Still there\r\nwere the two young mourners. Henrietta was completely unmanageable, only\r\nresting now and then to break forth with more violence; and her sorrow\r\nfar too selfish and unsubmissive to be soothed either by the thought of\r\nHim Who sent it, or of the peace and rest to which that beloved one was\r\ngone; and as once the anxiety for her brother had swallowed up all care\r\nfor her mother, so now grief for her mother absorbed every consideration\r\nfor Frederick; so that it was useless to attempt to persuade her to make\r\nany exertion for his sake. Nothing seemed in any degree to tranquillize\r\nher except Aunt Geoffrey\'s reading to her; and then it was only that\r\nshe was lulled by the sound of the voice, not that the sense reached\r\nher mind. But then, how go on reading to her all day, when poor Fred was\r\nleft in his lonely room, to bear his own share of sorrow in solitude?\r\nFor though Mr. and Mrs. Langford, and Uncle and Aunt Roger, made him\r\nmany brief kind visits, they all of them had either too much on their\r\nhands, or were unfitted by disposition to be the companions he wanted.\r\nIt was only Aunt Geoffrey who could come and sit by him, and tell him\r\nall those precious sayings of his mother in her last days, which in her\r\nsubdued low voice renewed that idea of perfect peace and repose which\r\ncame with the image of his mother, and seemed to still the otherwise\r\noverpowering thought that she was gone. But in the midst the door would\r\nopen, and grandmamma would come in, looking much distressed, with some\r\nsuch request as this--"Beatrice, if Fred can spare you, would you just\r\ngo up to poor Henrietta? I thought she was better, and that it was as\r\nwell to do it at once; so I went to ask her for one of her dresses, to\r\nsend for a pattern for her mourning, and that has set her off crying\r\nto such a degree, that Elizabeth and I can do nothing with her. I wish\r\nGeoffrey was come!"\r\n\r\nNothing was expressed so often through the day as this wish, and no one\r\nwished more earnestly than his wife, though, perhaps, she was the only\r\nperson who did not say so a dozen times. There was something cheering in\r\nhearing that his brother had actually set off to meet him at Allonfield;\r\nand at length Fred\'s sharpened ears caught the sound of the carriage\r\nwheels, and he was come. It seemed as if he was considered by all as\r\ntheir own exclusive property. His mother had one of her quick, sudden\r\nbursts of lamentation as soon as she saw him; his brother, as usual,\r\nwanted to talk to him; Fred was above all eager for him; and it was only\r\nhis father who seemed even to recollect that his wife might want\r\nhim more than all. And so she did. Her feelings were very strong and\r\nimpetuous by nature, and the loss was one of the greatest she could have\r\nsustained. Nothing save her husband and her child was so near to\r\nher heart as her sister; and worn out as she was by long attendance,\r\nsleepless nights, and this trying day, when all seemed to rest upon her,\r\nshe now completely gave way, and was no sooner alone with her husband\r\nand daughter, than her long repressed feelings relieved themselves in\r\na flood of tears, which, though silent, were completely beyond her own\r\ncontrol. Now that he was come, she could, and indeed must, give way; and\r\nthe more she attempted to tell him of the peacefulness of her own dear\r\nMary, the more her tears would stream forth. He saw how it was, and\r\nwould not let her even reproach herself for her weakness, or attempt any\r\nlonger to exert herself; but made her lie down on her bed, and told her\r\nthat he and Queen Bee could manage very well.\r\n\r\nQueen Bee stood there pale, still, and bewildered-looking. She had\r\nscarcely spoken since she heard of her aunt\'s death; and new as\r\naffliction was to her sunny life, scarce knew where she was, or whether\r\nthis was her own dear Knight Sutton; and even her mother\'s grief seemed\r\nto her almost more like a dream.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes," said Mrs. Geoffrey Langford, as soon as her daughter had been\r\nnamed, "I ought to have sent you to Henrietta before."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Beatrice, though her heart sank within her as she\r\nthought of her last attempt at consoling Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Go straight up to her," continued her mother; "don\'t wait to let her\r\nthink whether she will see you or not. I only wish poor Fred could do\r\nthe same."\r\n\r\n"If I could but do her any good," sighed Beatrice, as she opened the\r\ndoor and hastened upstairs. She knocked, and entered without waiting for\r\nan answer: Henrietta lifted up her head, came forward with a little cry,\r\nthrew herself into her arms, and wept bitterly. Mournful as all around\r\nwas, there was a bright ray of comfort in Queen Bee\'s heart when she\r\nwas thus hailed as a friend and comforter. She only wished and longed to\r\nknow what might best serve to console her poor Henrietta; but all that\r\noccurred to her was to embrace and fondle her very affectionately, and\r\ncall her by the most caressing names. This was all that Henrietta was\r\nas yet fit to bear; and after a time, growing quieter, she poured out\r\nto her cousin all her grief, without fear of blame for its violence.\r\nBeatrice was sometimes indeed startled by the want of all idea\r\nof resignation, but she could not believe that any one could feel\r\notherwise,--least of all Henrietta, who had lost her only parent, and\r\nthat parent Aunt Mary. Neither did she feel herself good enough to talk\r\nseriously to Henrietta; she considered herself as only sent to sit with\r\nher, so she did not make any attempt to preach the resignation which was\r\nso much wanted; and Henrietta, who had all day been hearing of it, and\r\nrebelling against it, was almost grateful to her. So Henrietta talked\r\nand talked, the same repeated lamentation, the same dreary views of the\r\nfuture coming over and over again; and Beatrice\'s only answer was to\r\nagree with all her heart to all that was said of her own dear Aunt Mary,\r\nand to assure Henrietta of the fervent love that was still left for her\r\nin so many hearts on earth.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed on; Beatrice was called away and Henrietta was inclined\r\nto be fretful at her leaving her; but she presently returned, and the\r\nsame discourse was renewed, until at last Beatrice began to read to\r\nher, and thus did much to soothe her spirits, persuaded her to make a\r\ntolerable meal at tea-time, bathed her eyelids that were blistered with\r\ntears, put her to bed, and finally read her to sleep. Then, as she crept\r\nquietly down to inquire after her mamma, and wish the others in the\r\ndrawing-room good night, she reflected whether she had done what she\r\nought for her cousin.\r\n\r\n"I have not put a single right or really consoling thought into her\r\nhead," said she to herself; "for as to the reading, she did not attend\r\nto that. But after all I could not have done it. I must be better myself\r\nbefore I try to improve other people; and it is not what I deserve to be\r\nallowed to be any comfort at all."\r\n\r\nThanks partly to Beatrice\'s possessing no rightful authority over\r\nHenrietta, partly to the old habit of relying on her, she contrived to\r\nmake her get up and dress herself at the usual time next morning. But\r\nnothing would prevail on her to go down stairs. She said she could\r\nnot endure to pass "that door," where ever before the fondest welcome\r\nawaited her; and as to seeing her brother, that having been deferred\r\nyesterday, seemed to-day doubly dreadful. The worst of this piece of\r\nperverseness--for it really deserved no better name--was that it began\r\nto vex Fred. "But that I know how to depend upon you, Uncle Geoffrey,"\r\nsaid he, "I should really think she must be ill. I never knew anything\r\nso strange."\r\n\r\nUncle Geoffrey resolved to put an end to it, if possible; and soon after\r\nleaving Fred\'s room he knocked at his niece\'s door. She was sitting by\r\nthe fire with a book in her hand, but not reading.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, my dear," said he, taking her languid hand. "I bring you\r\na message from Fred, that he hopes you are soon coming down to see him."\r\n\r\nShe turned away her head. "Poor dear Fred!" said she; "but it is quite\r\nimpossible. I cannot bear it as he does; I should only overset him and\r\ndo him harm."\r\n\r\n"And why cannot you bear it as he does?" said her uncle gravely. "You\r\ndo not think his affection for her was less? and you have all the\r\nadvantages of health and strength."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no one can feel as I do!" cried Henrietta, with one of her\r\npassionate outbreaks. "O how I loved her!"\r\n\r\n"Fred did not love her less," proceeded her uncle. "And why will you\r\nleave him in sorrow and in weakness to doubt the sister\'s love that\r\nshould be his chief stay?"\r\n\r\n"He does not doubt it," sobbed Henrietta. "He knows me better."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Henrietta, what reason has he to trust to that affection which\r\nis not strong enough to overcome the dread of a few moments\' painful\r\nemotion?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but it is not that only! I shall feel it all so much more out\r\nof this room, where she has never been; but to see the rest of the\r\nhouse--to go past her door! O, uncle, I have not the strength for it."\r\n\r\n"No, your affection for him is not strong enough."\r\n\r\nHenrietta\'s pale cheeks flushed, and her tears were angry. "You do not\r\nknow me, Uncle Geoffrey," said she proudly, and then she almost choked\r\nwith weeping at unkindness where she most expected kindness.\r\n\r\n"I know this much of you, Henrietta. You have been nursing up your grief\r\nand encouraging yourself in murmuring and repining, in a manner which\r\nyou will one day see to have been sinful: you are obstinate in making\r\nyourself useless."\r\n\r\nHenrietta, little used to blame, was roused to defend herself with the\r\nfirst weapon she could. "Aunt Geoffrey is just as much knocked up as I\r\nam," said she.\r\n\r\nIf ever Uncle Geoffrey was made positively angry, he was so now, though\r\nif he had not thought it good that Henrietta should be roused, he would\r\nhave repressed even such demonstrations as he made. "Henrietta, this is\r\ntoo bad! Has she been weakly yielding?--has she been shutting herself up\r\nin her room, and keeping aloof from those who most needed her, lest she\r\nshould pain her own feelings? Have not you rather been perplexing and\r\ndistressing, and harassing her with your wilful selfishness, refusing to\r\ndo the least thing to assist her in the care of your own brother, after\r\nshe has been wearing herself out in watching over your mother? And now,\r\nwhen her strength and spirits are exhausted by the exertions she\r\nhas made for you and yours, and I have been obliged to insist on her\r\nresting, you fancy her example an excuse for you! Is this the way your\r\nmother would have acted? I see arguing with you does you no good: I have\r\nno more to say."\r\n\r\nHe got up, opened the door, and went out: Henrietta, dismayed at the\r\naccusation but too well founded on her words, had but one thought, that\r\nshe should not deem her regardless of his kindness. "Uncle Geoffrey!"\r\nshe cried, "O, uncle--" but he was gone; and forgetting everything else,\r\nshe flew after him down the stairs, and before she recollected anything\r\nelse, she found herself standing in the hall, saying, "O uncle, do not\r\nthink I meant that!"\r\n\r\nAt that moment her grandpapa came out of the drawing-room. "Henrietta!"\r\nsaid he, "I am glad to see you downstairs."\r\n\r\nHenrietta hastily returned his kiss, and looked somewhat confused; then\r\nlaying her hand entreatingly on her uncle\'s arm, said, "Only say you are\r\nnot angry with me."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Henrietta, not if you will act like a rational person," said\r\nhe with something of a smile, which she could not help returning in her\r\nsurprise at finding herself downstairs after all.\r\n\r\n"And you do not imagine me ungrateful?"\r\n\r\n"Not when you are in your right senses."\r\n\r\n"Ungrateful!" exclaimed Mr. Langford. "What is he accusing you of,\r\nHenrietta? What is the meaning of all this?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Uncle Geoffrey, "but that Henrietta and I have both been\r\nsomewhat angry with each other; but we have made it up now, have we not,\r\nHenrietta?"\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful how much good the very air of the hall was doing\r\nHenrietta, and how fast it was restoring her energy and power of turning\r\nher mind to other things. She answered a few remarks of grandpapa\'s\r\nwith very tolerable cheerfulness, and even when the hall door opened\r\nand admitted Uncle and Aunt Roger, she did not run away, but stayed to\r\nreceive their greetings before turning to ascend the stairs.\r\n\r\n"You are not going to shut yourself up in your own room again?" said\r\ngrandpapa.\r\n\r\n"No, I was only going to Fred," said she, growing as desirous of seeing\r\nhim as she had before been averse to it.\r\n\r\n"Suppose," said Uncle Geoffrey, "that you were to take a turn or two\r\nround the garden first. There is Queen Bee, she will go out with you,\r\nand you will bring Fred in a fresher face."\r\n\r\n"I will fetch your bonnet," said Queen Bee, who was standing at the top\r\nof the stairs, wisely refraining from expressing her astonishment at\r\nseeing her cousin in the hall.\r\n\r\nAnd before Henrietta had time to object, the bonnet was on her head, a\r\nshawl thrown round her, Beatrice had drawn her arm within hers, and had\r\nopened the sashed door into the garden.\r\n\r\nIt was a regular April day, with all the brilliancy and clearness of the\r\nsunshine that comes between showers, the white clouds hung in huge soft\r\nmasses on the blue sky, the leaves of the evergreens were glistening\r\nwith drops of rain, the birds sang sweetly in the shrubs around.\r\nHenrietta\'s burning eyes felt refreshed, and though she sighed heavily,\r\nshe could not help admiring, but Beatrice was surprised that the first\r\nthing she began to say was an earnest inquiry after Aunt Geoffrey, and a\r\nwarm expression of gratitude towards her.\r\n\r\nThen the conversation died away again, and they completed their two\r\nturns in silence; but Henrietta\'s heart began to fail her when she\r\nthought of going in without having her to greet. She lingered and could\r\nhardly resolve to go, but at length she entered, walked up the stairs,\r\ngave her shawl and bonnet to Beatrice, and tapped at Fred\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Is that you?" was his eager answer, and as she entered he came forward\r\nto meet her. "Poor Henrietta!" was all he said, as she put her arm round\r\nhis neck and kissed him, and then leaning on her he returned to his\r\nsofa, made her sit by him, and showed all sorts of kind solicitude for\r\nher comfort. She had cried so much that she felt as if she could cry no\r\nlonger, but she reproached herself excessively for having left him to\r\nhimself so long, when all he wanted was to comfort her; and she tried to\r\nmake some apology.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry I did not come sooner, Fred."\r\n\r\n"O, it is of no use to talk about it," said Fred, playing with her long\r\ncurls as she sat on a footstool close to him, just as she used to do in\r\ntimes long gone by. "You are come now, and that is all I want. Have you\r\nbeen out? I thought I heard the garden door just before you came in."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I took two turns with Queen Bee. How bright and sunny it is. And\r\nhow are you this morning, Freddy?"\r\n\r\n"O, pretty well I think," said he, sighing, as if he cared little about\r\nthe matter. "I wanted to show you this, Henrietta." And he took up a\r\nbook where he had marked a passage for her. She saw several paper marks\r\nin some other books, and perceived with shame that he had been reading\r\nyesterday, and choosing out what might comfort her, his selfish sister,\r\nas she could not help feeling herself.\r\n\r\nAnd here was the first great point gained, though there was still\r\nmuch for Henrietta to learn. It was the first time she had ever been\r\nconscious of her own selfishness, or perhaps more justly, of her\r\nproneness to make all give way to her own feeling of the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was some question as to who should attend the funeral. Henrietta\r\nshuddered and trembled all over as if it were a cruelty to mention it\r\nbefore her; but Frederick was very desirous that she should be there,\r\npartly from a sort of feeling that she would represent himself, and\r\npartly from a strong conviction that it would be good for her. She was\r\nwilling to do anything or everything for him, to make up for her day\'s\r\nneglect: and she consented, though with many tears, and was glad that at\r\nleast Fred seemed satisfied, and her uncle looked pleased with her.\r\n\r\nAunt Geoffrey undertook to stay with Fred, and Henrietta, who clung much\r\nto Beatrice, felt relieved by the thought of her support in such an hour\r\nof trial. She remembered the day when, with a kind of agreeable emotion,\r\nshe had figured to herself her father\'s funeral, little thinking of the\r\nreality that so soon awaited her, so much worse, as she thought,\r\nthan what any of them could even then have felt; and it seemed to her\r\nperfectly impossible that she should ever have power to go through with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn was much, however, that she should have agreed to what in the\r\nprospect gave her so much pain; and perhaps, for that very reason,\r\nshe found the reality less overwhelming than she had dreaded. Seeing\r\nnothing, observing nothing, hardly conscious of anything, she walked\r\nalong, wrapped in one absorbing sense of wretchedness; and the first\r\nwords that "broke the stillness of that hour," healing as they were,\r\nseemed but to add certainty to that one thought that "she was gone." But\r\nwhile the Psalms and the Lessons were read, the first heavy oppression\r\nof grief seemed in some degree to grow lighter. She could listen, and\r\nthe words reached her mind; a degree of thankfulness arose to Him Who\r\nhad wiped away the tears from her mother\'s eyes, and by Whom the sting\r\nof death had been taken away. Yes; she had waited in faith, in patience,\r\nin meek submission, until now her long widowhood was over; and what\r\nbetter for her could those who most loved her desire, than that she\r\nshould safely sleep in the chancel of the Church of her childhood, close\r\nto him whom she had so loved and so mourned, until the time when both\r\nshould once more awaken,--the corruptible should put on incorruption,\r\nthe mortal should put on immortality, and death be swallowed up in\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nSomething of this was what Henrietta began to feel; and though the tears\r\nflowed fast, they were not the bitter drops of personal sorrow. She was\r\nenabled to bear, without the agony she had expected, the standing round\r\nthe grave in the chancel; nor did her heart swell rebelliously against\r\nthe expression that it was "in great mercy that the soul of this our\r\ndear sister" was taken, even though she shrank and shivered at the sound\r\nof the earth cast in, which would seem to close up from her for ever\r\nthe most loved and loving creature that she would ever know. No, not for\r\never,--might she too but keep her part in Him Who is the Resurrection\r\nand the Life--might she be found acceptable in His sight, and receive\r\nthe blessing to be pronounced to all that love and fear Him.\r\n\r\nIt was over: they all stood round for a few minutes. At last Mr.\r\nLangford moved; Henrietta was also obliged to turn away, but before\r\ndoing so, she raised her eyes to her father\'s name, to take leave of him\r\nas it were, as she always did before going out of Church. She met her\r\nUncle Geoffrey\'s eye as she did so, and took his arm; and as soon as\r\nshe was out of the church, she said almost in a whisper, "Uncle, I don\'t\r\nwish for him now."\r\n\r\nHe pressed her arm, and looked most kindly at her, but he did not speak,\r\nfor he could hardly command his voice; and he saw, too, that she might\r\nsafely be trusted to the influences of that only true consolation which\r\nwas coming upon her.\r\n\r\nThey came home--to the home that looked as if it would fain be once more\r\ncheerful, with the front window blinds drawn up again, and the solemn\r\nstillness no longer observed. Henrietta hastened up to her own room,\r\nfor she could not bear to show herself to her brother in her long crape\r\nveil. She threw her bonnet off, knelt down for a few minutes, but rose\r\non hearing the approach of Beatrice, who still shared the same room.\r\nBeatrice came in, and looked at her for a few moments, as if doubtful\r\nhow to address her; but at last she put her hand on her shoulder, and\r\nlooking earnestly in her face, repeated--\r\n\r\n\r\n"Then cheerily to your work again, With hearts new braced and set, To\r\nrun untir\'d love\'s blessed race, As meet for those who, face to face,\r\nOver the grave their Lord have met."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes, Queenie," said Henrietta, giving a long sigh, "it is a very\r\ndifferent world to me now; but I do mean to try. And first, dear Bee,\r\nyou must let me thank you for having been very kind to me this long time\r\npast, though I am afraid I showed little thankfulness." She kissed her\r\naffectionately, and the tears almost choked Beatrice.\r\n\r\n"Me! me, of all people," she said. "O, Henrietta!"\r\n\r\n"We must talk of it all another time," said Henrietta, "but now it will\r\nnot do to stay away from Fred any longer. Don\'t think this like the days\r\nwhen I used to run away from you in the winter, Bee--that time when I\r\nwould not stop and talk about the verses on the holly."\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke, there was something of the "new bracing" visible in\r\nevery movement, as she set her dress to rights, and arranged her curls,\r\nwhich of late she had been used to allow to hang in a deplorable way,\r\nthat showed how little vigour or inclination to bear up there was about\r\nher whole frame.\r\n\r\n"O no, do not stay with me," said Queen Bee, "I am going"--to mamma, she\r\nwould have said, but she hardly knew how to use the word when speaking\r\nto Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henrietta, understanding her. "And tell her, Bee--for I am\r\nsure I shall never be able to say it to her,--all about our thanks, and\r\nhow sorry I am that I cared so little about her or her comfort." "If I\r\nhad only believed, instead of blinding myself so wilfully!" she almost\r\nwhispered to herself with a deep sigh; but being now ready, she ran\r\ndownstairs and entered her brother\'s room. His countenance bore\r\ntraces of weeping, but he was still calm; and as she came in he looked\r\nanxiously at her. She spoke quietly as she sat down by him, put her hand\r\ninto his, and said, "Thank you, dear Fred, for making me go."\r\n\r\n"I was quite sure you would be glad when it was over," said Fred. "I\r\nhave been reading the service with Aunt Geoffrey, but that is a very\r\ndifferent thing."\r\n\r\n"It will all come to you when you go to Church again," said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"How little I thought that New Year\'s Day--!" said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Ah! and how little we either of us thought last summer\'s holidays!"\r\nsaid Henrietta. "If it was not for that, I could bear it all better;\r\nbut it was my determination to come here that seems to have caused\r\neverything, and that is the thought I cannot bear."\r\n\r\n"I was talking all that over with Uncle Geoffrey last night," said\r\nFred, "and he especially warned us against reproaching ourselves with\r\nconsequences. He said it was he who had helped my father to choose the\r\nhorse that caused his death, and asked me if I thought he ought to blame\r\nhimself for that. I said no; and he went on to tell me that he did not\r\nthink we ought to take unhappiness to ourselves for what has happened\r\nnow; that we ought to think of the actions themselves, instead of the\r\nresults. Now my skating that day was just as bad as my driving, except,\r\nto be sure, that I put nobody in danger but myself; it was just as much\r\ndisobedience, and I ought to be just as sorry for it, though nothing\r\ncame of it, except that I grew more wilful."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Henrietta, "but I shall always feel as if everything had\r\nbeen caused by me. I am sure I shall never dare wish anything again."\r\n\r\n"It was just as much my wish as yours," said Fred.\r\n\r\n"Ah! but you did not go on always trying to make her do what you\r\npleased, and keeping her to it, and almost thinking it a thing of\r\ncourse, to make her give up her wishes to yours. That was what I was\r\nalways doing, and now I can never make up for it!"\r\n\r\n"O yes," said Fred, "we can never feel otherwise than that. To know how\r\nshe forgave us both, and how her wishes always turned to be the same\r\nas ours, if ours were not actually wrong; that is little comfort to\r\nremember, now, but perhaps it will be in time. But don\'t you see,\r\nHenrietta, my dear, what Uncle Geoffrey means?--that if you did domineer\r\nover her, it was very wrong, and you may be sorry for that; but that you\r\nmust not accuse yourself of doing all the mischief by bringing her here.\r\nHe says he does not know whether it was not, after all, what was most\r\nfor her comfort, if--"\r\n\r\n"O, Freddy, to have you almost killed!"\r\n\r\n"If the thoughts I have had lately will but stay with me when I am well\r\nagain, I do not think my accident will be a matter of regret, Henrietta.\r\nJust consider, when I was so disobedient in these little things, and\r\nattending so little to her or to Uncle Geoffrey, how likely it was that\r\nI might have gone on to much worse at school and college."\r\n\r\n"Never, never!" said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n"Not now, I hope," said Fred; "but that was not what I meant to say. No\r\none could say, Uncle Geoffrey told me, that the illness was brought on\r\neither by anxiety or over-exertion. The complaint was of long standing,\r\nand must have made progress some time or other; and he said that he was\r\nconvinced that, as she said to Aunt Geoffrey, she had rather have been\r\nhere than anywhere else. She said she could only be sorry for grandpapa\r\nand grandmamma\'s sake, but that for herself it was great happiness to\r\nhave been to Knight Sutton Church once more; and she was most thankful\r\nthat she had come to die in my father\'s home, after seeing us well\r\nsettled here, instead of leaving us to come to it as a strange place."\r\n\r\n"How little we guessed it was for that," said Henrietta. "O what were we\r\ndoing? But if it made her happy--"\r\n\r\n"Just imagine what to-day would have been if we were at Rocksand," said\r\nFred. "I, obliged to go back to school directly, and you, taking leave\r\nof everything there which would seem to you so full of her; and Uncle\r\nGeoffrey, just bringing you here without any time to stay with you, and\r\nthe place and people all strange. I am sure that she who thought so much\r\nfor you, must have rejoiced that you are at home here already."\r\n\r\n"Home!" said Henrietta, "how determinedly we used to call it so! But O,\r\nthat my wish should have turned out in such a manner! If it has been all\r\noverruled so as to be happiness to her, as I am sure it has, I cannot\r\ncomplain; but I think I shall never wish again, or care for my own way."\r\n\r\n"The devices and desires of our own hearts!" said Fred.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I shall ever have spirit enough to be wilful for my own\r\nsake," proceeded Henrietta. "Nothing will ever be the same pleasure to\r\nme, as when she used to be my other self, and enjoy it all over again\r\nfor me; so that it was all twofold!" Here she hid her face, and her\r\ntears streamed fast, but they were soft and calm; and when she saw that\r\nFred also was much overcome, she recalled her energies in a minute.\r\n\r\n"But, Fred, I may well be thankful that I have you, which is far more\r\nthan I deserve; and as long as we do what she wished, we are still\r\nobeying her. I think at last I may get something of the right sort of\r\nfeeling; for I am sure I see much better now what she and grandpapa used\r\nto mean when they talked about dear papa. And now do you like for me to\r\nread to you?"\r\n\r\nFew words more require to be said of Frederick and Henrietta Langford.\r\nKnight Sutton Hall was according to their mother\'s wish, their home;\r\nand there Henrietta had the consolation, during the advancing spring and\r\nsummer, of watching her brother\'s recovery, which was very slow, but at\r\nthe same time steady. Mrs. Geoffrey Langford stayed with her as long as\r\nhe required much nursing; and Henrietta learnt to look upon her, not as\r\nquite a mother, but at any rate as more than an aunt, far more than\r\nshe had ever been to her before; and when at length she was obliged to\r\nreturn to Westminster, it was a great satisfaction to think how soon the\r\nvacation would bring them all back to Knight Sutton.\r\n\r\nThe holidays arrived, and with them Alexander, who, to his great\r\ndisappointment, was obliged to give up all his generous hopes that Fred\r\nwould be one of his competitors for the prize, when he found him able\r\nindeed to be with the family, to walk short distances, and to resume\r\nmany of his former habits; but still very easily tired, and his head in\r\na condition to suffer severely from noise, excitement, or application.\r\nPerhaps this was no bad thing for their newly formed alliance, as\r\nAlex had numberless opportunities of developing his consideration and\r\nkindness, by silencing his brothers, assisting his cousin when tired,\r\nand again and again silently giving up some favourite scheme of\r\namusement when Fred proved to be unequal to it. Even Henrietta herself\r\nalmost learned to trust Fred to Alex\'s care, which was so much less\r\nirritating than her own; and how greatly the Queen Bee was improved is\r\nbest shown, when it is related, that neither by word nor look did\r\nshe once interrupt the harmony between them, or attempt to obtain the\r\nattention, of which, in fact, she always had as large a share as any\r\nreasonable person could desire.\r\n\r\nHow fond Fred learnt to be of Alex will be easily understood, and the\r\nbest requital of his kindness that he could devise was an offer--a very\r\nadventurous one, as was thought by all who heard of it--to undertake\r\nlittle Willy\'s Latin, which being now far beyond Aunt Roger\'s knowledge,\r\nhad been under Alex\'s care for the holidays. Willy was a very good\r\npupil on the whole--better, it was said by most, than Alex himself had\r\nbeen--and very fond of Fred; but Latin grammar and Caesar formed such\r\na test as perhaps their alliance would scarcely have endured, if in an\r\ninsensible manner Willy and his books had not gradually been made over\r\nto Henrietta, whose great usefulness and good nature in this respect\r\nquite made up, in grandmamma\'s eyes, for her very tolerable amount of\r\nacquirements in Latin and Greek.\r\n\r\nBy the time care for her brother\'s health had ceased to be Henrietta\'s\r\ngrand object, and she was obliged once more to see him depart to pursue\r\nhis education, a whole circle of pursuits and occupations had sprung up\r\naround her, and given her the happiness of feeling herself both useful\r\nand valued. Old Mr. Langford saw in her almost the Mary he had parted\r\nwith when resumed in early girlhood by Mrs. Vivian; Mrs. Langford had a\r\ngranddaughter who would either be petted, sent on messages, or be civil\r\nto the Careys, as occasion served; Aunt Roger was really grateful\r\nto her, as well for the Latin and Greek she bestowed upon Willy and\r\nCharlie, as for the braided merino frocks or coats on which Bennet used\r\nto exercise her taste when Henrietta\'s wardrobe failed to afford her\r\nsufficient occupation. The boys all liked her, made a friend of her,\r\nand demonstrated it in various ways more or less uncouth: her manners\r\ngradually acquired the influence over them which Queen Bee had only\r\nexerted over Alex and Willy, and when, saving Carey and Dick, they grew\r\nless awkward and bearish, without losing their honest downright\r\ngood humour and good nature, Uncle Geoffrey only did her justice in\r\nattributing the change to her unconscious power. Miss Henrietta was\r\nalso the friend of the poor women, the teacher and guide of the school\r\nchildren, and in their eyes and imagination second to no one but Mr.\r\nFranklin. And withal she did not cease to be all that she had ever been\r\nto her brother, if not still more. His heart and soul were for her, and\r\nscarce a joy and sorrow but was shared between them. She was his home,\r\nhis everything, and she well fulfilled her mother\'s parting trust of\r\nbeing his truest friend and best-loved counsellor.\r\n\r\nWould that her own want of submission and resignation had not prevented\r\nher from hearing the dear accents in which that charge was conveyed!\r\nThis was, perhaps, the most deeply felt sorrow that followed her through\r\nlife; and even with the fair peaceful image of her beloved mother,\r\nthere was linked a painful memory of a long course of wilfulness and\r\ndomineering on her own part. But there was much to be dwelt on that\r\nspoke only of blessedness and love, and each day brought her nearer to\r\nher whom she had lost, so long as she was humbly striving to walk in the\r\nsteps of Him Who "came not to do His own will, but the will of Him that\r\nsent Him."\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Henrietta\'s Wish, by Charlotte M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
