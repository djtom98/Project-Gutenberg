The book, anonymously published, was an incredible success,\r\ngoing through printing after printing by several publishers over the\r\nnext few years. (I myself own three separate early editions of this\r\nbook by different publishers on both sides of the Atlantic.) The present\r\nGutenberg edition was scanned from the illustrated deluxe MacMillan\r\n(London) edition of 1900.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was a cousin of the better-known writer Katherine Mansfield\r\n(whose real name was Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp). Born in Australia,\r\nElizabeth was educated in England. She was reputed to be a fine organist\r\nand musician. At a young age, she captured the heart of a German Count,\r\nwas persuaded to marry him, and went to live in Germany. Over the next\r\nyears she bore five daughters. After her husband\'s death and the decline\r\nof the estate, she returned to England. She was a friend to many of high\r\nsocial standing, including people such as H. G. Wells (who considered\r\nher one of the finest wits of the day). Some time later she married the\r\nbrother of Bertrand Russell; which marriage was a failure and ended in\r\ndivorce. Eventually Elizabeth fled to America at the outbreak of the\r\nSecond World War, and there died in 1941.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is best known to modern readers by the name "Elizabeth von\r\nArnim", author of "The Enchanted April" which was recently made into\r\na successful film by the same title. Another of her books, "Mr.\r\nSkeffington" was also once made into a film starring Bette Davis, circa\r\n1940.\r\n\r\nSome of Elizabeth\'s work is published in modern editions by Virago\r\nand other publishers. Among these are: "Love", "The Enchanted April",\r\n"Caravaners", "Christopher and Columbus", "The Pastor\'s Wife", "Mr.\r\nSkeffington", "The Solitary Summer", and "Elizabeth\'s Adventures in\r\nRugen". Also published by Virago is her non-autobiography "All the Dogs\r\nof My Life"--as the title suggests, it is the story not of her life, but\r\nof the lives of the many dogs she owned; though of course it does touch\r\nupon her own experiences.\r\n\r\nIn the centennial year of this book\'s first publication, I hope that its\r\navailability through Project Gutenberg will stir some renewed interest\r\nin Elizabeth and her delightful work. She is, I would venture, my\r\nfavorite author; and I hope that soon she will be one of your favorites.\r\n\r\nR.

I am writing in it now in the late afternoon\r\nloveliness, much interrupted by the mosquitoes and the temptation to\r\nlook at all the glories of the new green leaves washed half an hour ago\r\nin a cold shower. Two owls are perched near me, and are carrying on a\r\nlong conversation that I enjoy as much as any warbling of nightingales.\r\nThe gentleman owl says [[musical notes occur here in the printed text]],\r\nand she answers from her tree a little way off, [[musical notes]],\r\nbeautifully assenting to and completing her lord\'s remark, as becomes\r\na properly constructed German she-owl. They say the same thing over and\r\nover again so emphatically that I think it must be something nasty about\r\nme; but I shall not let myself be frightened away by the sarcasm of\r\nowls.\r\n\r\nThis is less a garden than a wilderness. No one has lived in the house,\r\nmuch less in the garden, for twenty-five years, and it is such a\r\npretty old place that the people who might have lived here and did\r\nnot, deliberately preferring the horrors of a flat in a town, must have\r\nbelonged to that vast number of eyeless and earless persons of whom the\r\nworld seems chiefly composed. Noseless too, though it does not sound\r\npretty; but the greater part of my spring happiness is due to the scent\r\nof the wet earth and young leaves.\r\n\r\nI am always happy (out of doors be it understood, for indoors there\r\nare servants and furniture) but in quite different ways, and my spring\r\nhappiness bears no resemblance to my summer or autumn happiness, though\r\nit is not more intense, and there were days last winter when I danced\r\nfor sheer joy out in my frost-bound garden, in spite of my years and\r\nchildren. But I did it behind a bush, having a due regard for the\r\ndecencies.\r\n\r\nThere are so many bird-cherries round me, great trees with branches\r\nsweeping the grass, and they are so wreathed just now with white\r\nblossoms and tenderest green that the garden looks like a wedding.\r\nI never saw such masses of them; they seemed to fill the place. Even\r\nacross a little stream that bounds the garden on the east, and right in\r\nthe middle of the cornfield beyond, there is an immense one, a picture\r\nof grace and glory against the cold blue of the spring sky.\r\n\r\nMy garden is surrounded by cornfields and meadows, and beyond are great\r\nstretches of sandy heath and pine forests, and where the forests leave\r\noff the bare heath begins again; but the forests are beautiful in\r\ntheir lofty, pink-stemmed vastness, far overhead the crowns of softest\r\ngray-green, and underfoot a bright green wortleberry carpet, and\r\neverywhere the breathless silence; and the bare heaths are beautiful\r\ntoo, for one can see across them into eternity almost, and to go out on\r\nto them with one\'s face towards the setting sun is like going into the\r\nvery presence of God.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this plain is the oasis of birdcherries and greenery\r\nwhere I spend my happy days, and in the middle of the oasis is the gray\r\nstone house with many gables where I pass my reluctant nights. The house\r\nis very old, and has been added to at various times. It was a convent\r\nbefore the Thirty Years\' War, and the vaulted chapel, with its brick\r\nfloor worn by pious peasant knees, is now used as a hall. Gustavus\r\nAdolphus and his Swedes passed through more than once, as is duly\r\nrecorded in archives still preserved, for we are on what was then the\r\nhigh-road between Sweden and Brandenburg the unfortunate. The Lion of\r\nthe North was no doubt an estimable person and acted wholly up to his\r\nconvictions, but he must have sadly upset the peaceful nuns, who were\r\nnot without convictions of their own, sending them out on to the wide,\r\nempty plain to piteously seek some life to replace the life of silence\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nFrom nearly all the windows of the house I can look out across the\r\nplain, with no obstacle in the shape of a hill, right away to a blue\r\nline of distant forest, and on the west side uninterruptedly to the\r\nsetting sun--nothing but a green, rolling plain, with a sharp edge\r\nagainst the sunset. I love those west windows better than any others,\r\nand have chosen my bedroom on that side of the house so that even times\r\nof hair-brushing may not be entirely lost, and the young woman who\r\nattends to such matters has been taught to fulfil her duties about a\r\nmistress recumbent in an easychair before an open window, and not to\r\nprofane with chatter that sweet and solemn time. This girl is grieved\r\nat my habit of living almost in the garden, and all her ideas as to the\r\nsort of life a respectable German lady should lead have got into a sad\r\nmuddle since she came to me. The people round about are persuaded that I\r\nam, to put it as kindly as possible, exceedingly eccentric, for the news\r\nhas travelled that I spend the day out of doors with a book, and that no\r\nmortal eye has ever yet seen me sew or cook. But why cook when you can\r\nget some one to cook for you? And as for sewing, the maids will hem the\r\nsheets better and quicker than I could, and all forms of needlework of\r\nthe fancy order are inventions of the evil one for keeping the foolish\r\nfrom applying their heart to wisdom.\r\n\r\nWe had been married five years before it struck us that we might as well\r\nmake use of this place by coming down and living in it. Those five years\r\nwere spent in a flat in a town, and during their whole interminable\r\nlength I was perfectly miserable and perfectly healthy, which disposes\r\nof the ugly notion that has at times disturbed me that my happiness here\r\nis less due to the garden than to a good digestion. And while we were\r\nwasting our lives there, here was this dear place with dandelions up\r\nto the very door, all the paths grass-grown and completely effaced, in\r\nwinter so lonely, with nobody but the north wind taking the least notice\r\nof it, and in May--in all those five lovely Mays--no one to look at\r\nthe wonderful bird-cherries and still more wonderful masses of lilacs,\r\neverything glowing and blowing, the virginia creeper madder every year,\r\nuntil at last, in October, the very roof was wreathed with blood-red\r\ntresses, the owls and the squirrels and all the blessed little birds\r\nreigning supreme, and not a living creature ever entering the empty\r\nhouse except the snakes, which got into the habit during those silent\r\nyears of wriggling up the south wall into the rooms on that side\r\nwhenever the old housekeeper opened the windows. All that was\r\nhere,--peace, and happiness, and a reasonable life,--and yet it never\r\nstruck me to come and live in it. Looking back I am astonished, and can\r\nin no way account for the tardiness of my discovery that here, in this\r\nfar-away corner, was my kingdom of heaven. Indeed, so little did it\r\nenter my head to even use the place in summer, that I submitted to weeks\r\nof seaside life with all its horrors every year; until at last, in\r\nthe early spring of last year, having come down for the opening of the\r\nvillage school, and wandering out afterwards into the bare and desolate\r\ngarden, I don\'t know what smell of wet earth or rotting leaves brought\r\nback my childhood with a rush and all the happy days I had spent in a\r\ngarden. Shall I ever forget that day? It was the beginning of my real\r\nlife, my coming of age as it were, and entering into my kingdom. Early\r\nMarch, gray, quiet skies, and brown, quiet earth; leafless and sad\r\nand lonely enough out there in the damp and silence, yet there I stood\r\nfeeling the same rapture of pure delight in the first breath of spring\r\nthat I used to as a child, and the five wasted years fell from me like a\r\ncloak, and the world was full of hope, and I vowed myself then and there\r\nto nature, and have been happy ever since.\r\n\r\nMy other half being indulgent, and with some faint thought perhaps that\r\nit might be as well to look after the place, consented to live in it\r\nat any rate for a time; whereupon followed six specially blissful weeks\r\nfrom the end of April into June, during which I was here alone, supposed\r\nto be superintending the painting and papering, but as a matter of fact\r\nonly going into the house when the workmen had gone out of it.\r\n\r\nHow happy I was! I don\'t remember any time quite so perfect since the\r\ndays when I was too little to do lessons and was turned out with sugar\r\non my eleven o\'clock bread and butter on to a lawn closely strewn with\r\ndandelions and daisies. The sugar on the bread and butter has lost its\r\ncharm, but I love the dandelions and daisies even more passionately now\r\nthan then, and never would endure to see them all mown away if I were\r\nnot certain that in a day or two they would be pushing up their little\r\nfaces again as jauntily as ever. During those six weeks I lived in a\r\nworld of dandelions and delights. The dandelions carpeted the three\r\nlawns,--they used to be lawns, but have long since blossomed out into\r\nmeadows filled with every sort of pretty weed,--and under and among the\r\ngroups of leafless oaks and beeches were blue hepaticas, white anemones,\r\nviolets, and celandines in sheets. The celandines in particular\r\ndelighted me with their clean, happy brightness, so beautifully trim\r\nand newly varnished, as though they too had had the painters at work\r\non them. Then, when the anemones went, came a few stray periwinkles and\r\nSolomon\'s Seal, and all the birdcherries blossomed in a burst. And then,\r\nbefore I had a little got used to the joy of their flowers against the\r\nsky, came the lilacs--masses and masses of them, in clumps on the\r\ngrass, with other shrubs and trees by the side of walks, and one great\r\ncontinuous bank of them half a mile long right past the west front of\r\nthe house, away down as far as one could see, shining glorious against\r\na background of firs. When that time came, and when, before it was\r\nover, the acacias all blossomed too, and four great clumps of pale,\r\nsilvery-pink peonies flowered under the south windows, I felt so\r\nabsolutely happy, and blest, and thankful, and grateful, that I really\r\ncannot describe it. My days seemed to melt away in a dream of pink and\r\npurple peace.\r\n\r\nThere were only the old housekeeper and her handmaiden in the house, so\r\nthat on the plea of not giving too much trouble I could indulge what my\r\nother half calls my _fantaisie_ _dereglee_ as regards meals--that is to\r\nsay, meals so simple that they could be brought out to the lilacs on\r\na tray; and I lived, I remember, on salad and bread and tea the whole\r\ntime, sometimes a very tiny pigeon appearing at lunch to save me, as\r\nthe old lady thought, from starvation. Who but a woman could have stood\r\nsalad for six weeks, even salad sanctified by the presence and scent\r\nof the most gorgeous lilac masses? I did, and grew in grace every day,\r\nthough I have never liked it since. How often now, oppressed by the\r\nnecessity of assisting at three dining-room meals daily, two of which\r\nare conducted by the functionaries held indispensable to a proper\r\nmaintenance of the family dignity, and all of which are pervaded by\r\njoints of meat, how often do I think of my salad days, forty in number,\r\nand of the blessedness of being alone as I was then alone!\r\n\r\nAnd then the evenings, when the workmen had all gone and the house was\r\nleft to emptiness and echoes, and the old housekeeper had gathered up\r\nher rheumatic limbs into her bed, and my little room in quite another\r\npart of the house had been set ready, how reluctantly I used to leave\r\nthe friendly frogs and owls, and with my heart somewhere down in my\r\nshoes lock the door to the garden behind me, and pass through the long\r\nseries of echoing south rooms full of shadows and ladders and ghostly\r\npails of painters\' mess, and humming a tune to make myself believe\r\nI liked it, go rather slowly across the brick-floored hall, up the\r\ncreaking stairs, down the long whitewashed passage, and with a final\r\nrush of panic whisk into my room and double lock and bolt the door!\r\n\r\nThere were no bells in the house, and I used to take a great dinner-bell\r\nto bed with me so that at least I might be able to make a noise if\r\nfrightened in the night, though what good it would have been I don\'t\r\nknow, as there was no one to hear. The housemaid slept in another little\r\ncell opening out of mine, and we two were the only living creatures in\r\nthe great empty west wing. She evidently did not believe in ghosts, for\r\nI could hear how she fell asleep immediately after getting into bed; nor\r\ndo I believe in them, "mais je les redoute," as a French lady said, who\r\nfrom her books appears to have been strongminded.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-bell was a great solace; it was never rung, but it comforted\r\nme to see it on the chair beside my bed, as my nights were anything but\r\nplacid, it was all so strange, and there were such queer creakings and\r\nother noises. I used to lie awake for hours, startled out of a light\r\nsleep by the cracking of some board, and listen to the indifferent\r\nsnores of the girl in the next room. In the morning, of course, I was as\r\nbrave as a lion and much amused at the cold perspirations of the night\r\nbefore; but even the nights seem to me now to have been delightful,\r\nand myself like those historic boys who heard a voice in every wind\r\nand snatched a fearful joy. I would gladly shiver through them all\r\nover again for the sake of the beautiful purity of the house, empty of\r\nservants and upholstery.\r\n\r\nHow pretty the bedrooms looked with nothing in them but their cheerful\r\nnew papers! Sometimes I would go into those that were finished and build\r\nall sorts of castles in the air about their future and their past. Would\r\nthe nuns who had lived in them know their little white-washed cells\r\nagain, all gay with delicate flower papers and clean white paint? And\r\nhow astonished they would be to see cell No. 14 turned into a bathroom,\r\nwith a bath big enough to insure a cleanliness of body equal to their\r\npurity of soul! They would look upon it as a snare of the tempter; and I\r\nknow that in my own case I only began to be shocked at the blackness of\r\nmy nails the day that I began to lose the first whiteness of my soul by\r\nfalling in love at fifteen with the parish organist, or rather with the\r\nglimpse of surplice and Roman nose and fiery moustache which was all\r\nI ever saw of him, and which I loved to distraction for at least six\r\nmonths; at the end of which time, going out with my governess one day, I\r\npassed him in the street, and discovered that his unofficial garb was\r\na frock-coat combined with a turn-down collar and a "bowler" hat, and\r\nnever loved him any more.\r\n\r\nThe first part of that time of blessedness was the most perfect, for\r\nI had not a thought of anything but the peace and beauty all round me.\r\nThen he appeared suddenly who has a right to appear when and how he will\r\nand rebuked me for never having written, and when I told him that I had\r\nbeen literally too happy to think of writing, he seemed to take it as a\r\nreflection on himself that I could be happy alone. I took him round the\r\ngarden along the new paths I had had made, and showed him the acacia and\r\nlilac glories, and he said that it was the purest selfishness to enjoy\r\nmyself when neither he nor the offspring were with me, and that the\r\nlilacs wanted thoroughly pruning. I tried to appease him by offering him\r\nthe whole of my salad and toast supper which stood ready at the foot of\r\nthe little verandah steps when we came back, but nothing appeased that\r\nMan of Wrath, and he said he would go straight back to the neglected\r\nfamily. So he went; and the remainder of the precious time was disturbed\r\nby twinges of conscience (to which I am much subject) whenever I found\r\nmyself wanting to jump for joy. I went to look at the painters every\r\ntime my feet were for taking me to look at the garden; I trotted\r\ndiligently up and down the passages; I criticised and suggested and\r\ncommanded more in one day than I had done in all the rest of the time;\r\nI wrote regularly and sent my love; but I could not manage to fret and\r\nyearn. What are you to do if your conscience is clear and your liver in\r\norder and the sun is shining?\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 10th.--I knew nothing whatever last year about gardening and this\r\nyear know very little more, but I have dawnings of what may be done, and\r\nhave at least made one great stride--from ipomaea to tea-roses.\r\n\r\nThe garden was an absolute wilderness. It is all round the house, but\r\nthe principal part is on the south side and has evidently always been\r\nso. The south front is one-storied, a long series of rooms opening one\r\ninto the other, and the walls are covered with virginia creeper. There\r\nis a little verandah in the middle, leading by a flight of rickety\r\nwooden steps down into what seems to have been the only spot in the\r\nwhole place that was ever cared for. This is a semicircle cut into the\r\nlawn and edged with privet, and in this semicircle are eleven beds of\r\ndifferent sizes bordered with box and arranged round a sun-dial, and the\r\nsun-dial is very venerable and moss-grown, and greatly beloved by me.\r\nThese beds were the only sign of any attempt at gardening to be seen\r\n(except a solitary crocus that came up all by itself each spring in the\r\ngrass, not because it wanted to, but because it could not help it), and\r\nthese I had sown with ipomaea, the whole eleven, having found a German\r\ngardening book, according to which ipomaea in vast quantities was the\r\none thing needful to turn the most hideous desert into a paradise.\r\nNothing else in that book was recommended with anything like the same\r\nwarmth, and being entirely ignorant of the quantity of seed necessary, I\r\nbought ten pounds of it and had it sown not only in the eleven beds\r\nbut round nearly every tree, and then waited in great agitation for the\r\npromised paradise to appear. It did not, and I learned my first lesson.\r\n\r\nLuckily I had sown two great patches of sweetpeas which made me very\r\nhappy all the summer, and then there were some sunflowers and a few\r\nhollyhocks under the south windows, with Madonna lilies in between. But\r\nthe lilies, after being transplanted, disappeared to my great dismay,\r\nfor how was I to know it was the way of lilies? And the hollyhocks\r\nturned out to be rather ugly colours, so that my first summer was\r\ndecorated and beautified solely by sweet-peas. At present we are only\r\njust beginning to breathe after the bustle of getting new beds and\r\nborders and paths made in time for this summer. The eleven beds round\r\nthe sun-dial are filled with roses, but I see already that I have\r\nmade mistakes with some. As I have not a living soul with whom to hold\r\ncommunion on this or indeed on any matter, my only way of learning is\r\nby making mistakes. All eleven were to have been carpeted with purple\r\npansies, but finding that I had not enough and that nobody had any to\r\nsell me, only six have got their pansies, the others being sown with\r\ndwarf mignonette. Two of the eleven are filled with Marie van Houtte\r\nroses, two with Viscountess Folkestone, two with Laurette Messimy, one\r\nwith Souvenir de la Malmaison, one with Adam and Devoniensis, two with\r\nPersian Yellow and Bicolor, and one big bed behind the sun-dial with\r\nthree sorts of red roses (seventy-two in all), Duke of Teck, Cheshunt\r\nScarlet, and Prefet de Limburg. This bed is, I am sure, a mistake, and\r\nseveral of the others are, I think, but of course I must wait and see,\r\nbeing such an ignorant person. Then I have had two long beds made in the\r\ngrass on either side of the semicircle, each sown with mignonette, and\r\none filled with Marie van Houtte, and the other with Jules Finger and\r\nthe Bride; and in a warm corner under the drawing-room windows is a\r\nbed of Madame Lambard, Madame de Watteville, and Comtesse Riza du Parc;\r\nwhile farther down the garden, sheltered on the north and west by a\r\ngroup of beeches and lilacs, is another large bed, containing Rubens,\r\nMadame Joseph Schwartz, and the Hen. Edith Gifford. All these roses are\r\ndwarf; I have only two standards in the whole garden, two Madame George\r\nBruants, and they look like broomsticks. How I long for the day when\r\nthe tea-roses open their buds! Never did I look forward so intensely to\r\nanything; and every day I go the rounds, admiring what the dear little\r\nthings have achieved in the twenty-four hours in the way of new leaf or\r\nincrease of lovely red shoot.\r\n\r\nThe hollyhocks and lilies (now flourishing) are still under the south\r\nwindows in a narrow border on the top of a grass slope, at the foot of\r\nwhich I have sown two long borders of sweetpeas facing the rose beds, so\r\nthat my roses may have something almost as sweet as themselves to\r\nlook at until the autumn, when everything is to make place for more\r\ntea-roses. The path leading away from this semicircle down the garden is\r\nbordered with China roses, white and pink, with here and there a Persian\r\nYellow. I wish now I had put tea-roses there, and I have misgivings as\r\nto the effect of the Persian Yellows among the Chinas, for the Chinas\r\nare such wee little baby things, and the Persian Yellows look as though\r\nthey intended to be big bushes.\r\n\r\nThere is not a creature in all this part of the world who could in the\r\nleast understand with what heart-beatings I am looking forward to the\r\nflowering of these roses, and not a German gardening book that does not\r\nrelegate all tea-roses to hot-houses, imprisoning them for life, and\r\ndepriving them for ever of the breath of God. It was no doubt because I\r\nwas so ignorant that I rushed in where Teutonic angels fear to tread and\r\nmade my tea-roses face a northern winter; but they did face it under\r\nfir branches and leaves, and not one has suffered, and they are looking\r\nto-day as happy and as determined to enjoy themselves as any roses, I am\r\nsure, in Europe.\r\n\r\nMay 14th.--To-day I am writing on the verandah with the three babies,\r\nmore persistent than mosquitoes, raging round me, and already several of\r\nthe thirty fingers have been in the ink-pot and the owners consoled when\r\nduty pointed to rebukes. But who can rebuke such penitent and drooping\r\nsunbonnets? I can see nothing but sunbonnets and pinafores and nimble\r\nblack legs.\r\n\r\nThese three, their patient nurse, myself, the gardener, and the\r\ngardener\'s assistant, are the only people who ever go into my garden,\r\nbut then neither are we ever out of it. The gardener has been here a\r\nyear and has given me notice regularly on the first of every month, but\r\nup to now has been induced to stay on. On the first of this month he\r\ncame as usual, and with determination written on every feature told me\r\nhe intended to go in June, and that nothing should alter his decision.\r\nI don\'t think he knows much about gardening, but he can at least dig and\r\nwater, and some of the things he sows come up, and some of the plants\r\nhe plants grow, besides which he is the most unflaggingly industrious\r\nperson I ever saw, and has the great merit of never appearing to take\r\nthe faintest interest in what we do in the garden. So I have tried to\r\nkeep him on, not knowing what the next one may be like, and when I asked\r\nhim what he had to complain of and he replied "Nothing," I could only\r\nconclude that he has a personal objection to me because of my eccentric\r\npreference for plants in groups rather than plants in lines. Perhaps,\r\ntoo, he does not like the extracts from gardening books I read to him\r\nsometimes when he is planting or sowing something new. Being so helpless\r\nmyself, I thought it simpler, instead of explaining, to take the\r\nbook itself out to him and let him have wisdom at its very source,\r\nadministering it in doses while he worked. I quite recognise that this\r\nmust be annoying, and only my anxiety not to lose a whole year through\r\nsome stupid mistake has given me the courage to do it. I laugh\r\nsometimes behind the book at his disgusted face, and wish we could be\r\nphotographed, so that I may be reminded in twenty years\' time, when the\r\ngarden is a bower of loveliness and I learned in all its ways, of my\r\nfirst happy struggles and failures.\r\n\r\nAll through April he was putting the perennials we had sown in the\r\nautumn into their permanent places, and all through April he went about\r\nwith a long piece of string making parallel lines down the borders of\r\nbeautiful exactitude and arranging the poor plants like soldiers at a\r\nreview. Two long borders were done during my absence one day, and when I\r\nexplained that I should like the third to have plants in groups and\r\nnot in lines, and that what I wanted was a natural effect with no bare\r\nspaces of earth to be seen, he looked even more gloomily hopeless than\r\nusual; and on my going out later on to see the result, I found he had\r\nplanted two long borders down the sides of a straight walk with little\r\nlines of five plants in a row--first five pinks, and next to them five\r\nrockets, and behind the rockets five pinks, and behind the pinks five\r\nrockets, and so on with different plants of every sort and size down to\r\nthe end. When I protested, he said he had only carried out my orders\r\nand had known it would not look well; so I gave in, and the remaining\r\nborders were done after the pattern of the first two, and I will have\r\npatience and see how they look this summer, before digging them up\r\nagain; for it becomes beginners to be humble.\r\n\r\nIf I could only dig and plant myself! How much easier, besides being so\r\nfascinating, to make your own holes exactly where you want them and put\r\nin your plants exactly as you choose instead of giving orders that can\r\nonly be half understood from the moment you depart from the lines laid\r\ndown by that long piece of string! In the first ecstasy of having a\r\ngarden all my own, and in my burning impatience to make the waste places\r\nblossom like a rose, I did one warm Sunday in last year\'s April during\r\nthe servants\' dinner hour, doubly secure from the gardener by the day\r\nand the dinner, slink out with a spade and a rake and feverishly dig a\r\nlittle piece of ground and break it up and sow surreptitious ipomaea,\r\nand run back very hot and guilty into the house, and get into a chair\r\nand behind a book and look languid just in time to save my reputation.\r\nAnd why not? It is not graceful, and it makes one hot; but it is a\r\nblessed sort of work, and if Eve had had a spade in Paradise and known\r\nwhat to do with it, we should not have had all that sad business of the\r\napple.\r\n\r\nWhat a happy woman I am living in a garden, with books, babies,\r\nbirds, and flowers, and plenty of leisure to enjoy them! Yet my town\r\nacquaintances look upon it as imprisonment, and burying, and I don\'t\r\nknow what besides, and would rend the air with their shrieks if\r\ncondemned to such a life. Sometimes I feel as if I were blest above all\r\nmy fellows in being able to find my happiness so easily. I believe I\r\nshould always be good if the sun always shone, and could enjoy myself\r\nvery well in Siberia on a fine day. And what can life in town offer in\r\nthe way of pleasure to equal the delight of any one of the calm evenings\r\nI have had this month sitting alone at the foot of the verandah steps,\r\nwith the perfume of young larches all about, and the May moon hanging\r\nlow over the beeches, and the beautiful silence made only more profound\r\nin its peace by the croaking of distant frogs and hooting of owls? A\r\ncockchafer darting by close to my ear with a loud hum sends a shiver\r\nthrough me, partly of pleasure at the reminder of past summers, and\r\npartly of fear lest he should get caught in my hair. The Man of Wrath\r\nsays they are pernicious creatures and should be killed. I would rather\r\nget the killing done at the end of the summer and not crush them out of\r\nsuch a pretty world at the very beginning of all the fun.\r\n\r\nThis has been quite an eventful afternoon. My eldest baby, born in\r\nApril, is five years old, and the youngest, born in June, is three;\r\nso that the discerning will at once be able to guess the age of the\r\nremaining middle or May baby. While I was stooping over a group of\r\nhollyhocks planted on the top of the only thing in the shape of a hill\r\nthe garden possesses, the April baby, who had been sitting pensive on a\r\ntree stump close by, got up suddenly and began to run aimlessly about,\r\nshrieking and wringing her hands with every symptom of terror. I stared,\r\nwondering what had come to her; and then I saw that a whole army of\r\nyoung cows, pasturing in a field next to the garden, had got through the\r\nhedge and were grazing perilously near my tea-roses and most precious\r\nbelongings. The nurse and I managed to chase them away, but not before\r\nthey had trampled down a border of pinks and lilies in the cruellest\r\nway, and made great holes in a bed of China roses, and even begun to\r\nnibble at a Jackmanni clematis that I am trying to persuade to climb\r\nup a tree trunk. The gloomy gardener happened to be ill in bed, and the\r\nassistant was at vespers--as Lutheran Germany calls afternoon tea or its\r\nequivalent--so the nurse filled up the holes as well as she could with\r\nmould, burying the crushed and mangled roses, cheated for ever of their\r\nhopes of summer glory, and I stood by looking on dejectedly. The June\r\nbaby, who is two feet square and valiant beyond her size and years,\r\nseized a stick much bigger than herself and went after the cows, the\r\ncowherd being nowhere to be seen. She planted herself in front of them\r\nbrandishing her stick, and they stood in a row and stared at her in\r\ngreat astonishment; and she kept them off until one of the men from\r\nthe farm arrived with a whip, and having found the cowherd sleeping\r\npeacefully in the shade, gave him a sound beating. The cowherd is a\r\ngreat hulking young man, much bigger than the man who beat him, but he\r\ntook his punishment as part of the day\'s work and made no remark of any\r\nsort. It could not have hurt him much through his leather breeches, and\r\nI think he deserved it; but it must be demoralising work for a\r\nstrong young man with no brains looking after cows. Nobody with less\r\nimagination than a poet ought to take it up as a profession.\r\n\r\nAfter the June baby and I had been welcomed back by the other two with\r\nas many hugs as though we had been restored to them from great perils,\r\nand while we were peacefully drinking tea under a beech tree, I happened\r\nto look up into its mazy green, and there, on a branch quite close to my\r\nhead, sat a little baby owl. I got on the seat and caught it easily, for\r\nit could not fly, and how it had reached the branch at all is a mystery.\r\nIt is a little round ball of gray fluff, with the quaintest, wisest,\r\nsolemn face. Poor thing! I ought to have let it go, but the temptation\r\nto keep it until the Man of Wrath, at present on a journey, has seen it\r\nwas not to be resisted, as he has often said how much he would like to\r\nhave a young owl and try and tame it. So I put it into a roomy cage and\r\nslung it up on a branch near where it had been sitting, and which cannot\r\nbe far from its nest and its mother. We had hardly subsided again to our\r\ntea when I saw two more balls of fluff on the ground in the long grass\r\nand scarcely distinguishable at a little distance from small mole-hills.\r\nThese were promptly united to their relation in the cage, and now when\r\nthe Man of Wrath comes home, not only shall he be welcomed by a wife\r\ndecked with the orthodox smiles, but by the three little longed-for\r\nowls. Only it seems wicked to take them from their mother, and I know\r\nthat I shall let them go again some day--perhaps the very next time the\r\nMan of Wrath goes on a journey. I put a small pot of water in the cage,\r\nthough they never could have tasted water yet unless they drink the\r\nraindrops off the beech leaves. I suppose they get all the liquid they\r\nneed from the bodies of the mice and other dainties provided for them by\r\ntheir fond parents. But the raindrop idea is prettier.\r\n\r\nMay 15th.--How cruel it was of me to put those poor little owls into a\r\ncage even for one night! I cannot forgive myself, and shall never pander\r\nto the Man of Wrath\'s wishes again. This morning I got up early to see\r\nhow they were getting on, and I found the door of the cage wide open\r\nand no owls to be seen. I thought of course that somebody had stolen\r\nthem--some boy from the village, or perhaps the chastised cowherd. But\r\nlooking about I saw one perched high up in the branches of the beech\r\ntree, and then to my dismay one lying dead on the ground. The third was\r\nnowhere to be seen, and is probably safe in its nest. The parents must\r\nhave torn at the bars of the cage until by chance they got the door\r\nopen, and then dragged the little ones out and up into the tree. The\r\none that is dead must have been blown off the branch, as it was a windy\r\nnight and its neck is broken. There is one happy life less in the garden\r\nto-day through my fault, and it is such a lovely, warm day--just the\r\nsort of weather for young soft things to enjoy and grow in. The babies\r\nare greatly distressed, and are digging a grave, and preparing funeral\r\nwreaths of dandelions.\r\n\r\nJust as I had written that I heard sounds of arrival, and running out\r\nI breathlessly told the Man of Wrath how nearly I had been able to give\r\nhim the owls he has so often said he would like to have, and how sorry\r\nI was they were gone, and how grievous the death of one, and so on after\r\nthe voluble manner of women.\r\n\r\nHe listened till I paused to breathe, and then he said, "I am surprised\r\nat such cruelty. How could you make the mother owl suffer so? She had\r\nnever done you any harm."\r\n\r\nWhich sent me out of the house and into the garden more convinced than\r\never that he sang true who sang--\r\n\r\n     Two paradises \'twere in one to live in Paradise alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 16th.--The garden is the place I go to for refuge and shelter, not\r\nthe house. In the house are duties and annoyances, servants to exhort\r\nand admonish, furniture, and meals; but out there blessings crowd round\r\nme at every step--it is there that I am sorry for the unkindness in me,\r\nfor those selfish thoughts that are so much worse than they feel; it\r\nis there that all my sins and silliness are forgiven, there that I feel\r\nprotected and at home, and every flower and weed is a friend and every\r\ntree a lover. When I have been vexed I run out to them for comfort,\r\nand when I have been angry without just cause, it is there that I find\r\nabsolution. Did ever a woman have so many friends? And always the same,\r\nalways ready to welcome me and fill me with cheerful thoughts. Happy\r\nchildren of a common Father, why should I, their own sister, be less\r\ncontent and joyous than they? Even in a thunder storm, when other people\r\nare running into the house, I run out of it. I do not like thunder\r\nstorms--they frighten me for hours before they come, because I always\r\nfeel them on the way; but it is odd that I should go for shelter to the\r\ngarden. I feel better there, more taken care of, more petted. When\r\nit thunders, the April baby says, "There\'s lieber Gott scolding those\r\nangels again." And once, when there was a storm in the night, she\r\ncomplained loudly, and wanted to know why lieber Gott didn\'t do the\r\nscolding in the daytime, as she had been so tight asleep. They all three\r\nspeak a wonderful mixture of German and English, adulterating the purity\r\nof their native tongue by putting in English words in the middle of a\r\nGerman sentence. It always reminds me of Justice tempered by Mercy. We\r\nhave been cowslipping to-day in a little wood dignified by the name of\r\nthe Hirschwald, because it is the happy hunting-ground of innumerable\r\ndeer who fight there in the autumn evenings, calling each other out to\r\ncombat with bayings that ring through the silence and send agreeable\r\nshivers through the lonely listener. I often walk there in September,\r\nlate in the evening, and sitting on a fallen tree listen fascinated to\r\ntheir angry cries.\r\n\r\nWe made cowslip balls sitting on the grass. The babies had never seen\r\nsuch things nor had imagined anything half so sweet. The Hirschwald is\r\na little open wood of silver birches and springy turf starred with\r\nflowers, and there is a tiny stream meandering amiably about it and\r\ndecking itself in June with yellow flags. I have dreams of having a\r\nlittle cottage built there, with the daisies up to the door, and no path\r\nof any sort--just big enough to hold myself and one baby inside and a\r\npurple clematis outside. Two rooms--a bedroom and a kitchen. How scared\r\nwe would be at night, and how completely happy by day! I know the exact\r\nspot where it should stand, facing south-east, so that we should get\r\nall the cheerfulness of the morning, and close to the stream, so that we\r\nmight wash our plates among the flags. Sometimes, when in the mood for\r\nsociety, we would invite the remaining babies to tea and entertain them\r\nwith wild strawberries on plates of horse-chestnut leaves; but no one\r\nless innocent and easily pleased than a baby would be permitted to\r\ndarken the effulgence of our sunny cottage--indeed, I don\'t suppose that\r\nanybody wiser would care to come. Wise people want so many things\r\nbefore they can even begin to enjoy themselves, and I feel perpetually\r\napologetic when with them, for only being able to offer them that\r\nwhich I love best myself--apologetic, and ashamed of being so easily\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\nThe other day at a dinner party in the nearest town (it took us the\r\nwhole afternoon to get there) the women after dinner were curious to\r\nknow how I had endured the winter, cut off from everybody and snowed up\r\nsometimes for weeks.\r\n\r\n"Ah, these husbands!" sighed an ample lady, lugubriously shaking her\r\nhead; "they shut up their wives because it suits them, and don\'t care\r\nwhat their sufferings are."\r\n\r\nThen the others sighed and shook their heads too, for the ample lady\r\nwas a great local potentate, and one began to tell how another dreadful\r\nhusband had brought his young wife into the country and had kept her\r\nthere, concealing her beauty and accomplishments from the public in a\r\nmost cruel manner, and how, after spending a certain number of years in\r\nalternately weeping and producing progeny, she had quite lately run away\r\nwith somebody unspeakable--I think it was the footman, or the baker, or\r\nsome one of that sort.\r\n\r\n"But I am quite happy," I began, as soon as I could put in a word.\r\n\r\n"Ah, a good little wife, making the best of it," and the female\r\npotentate patted my hand, but continued gloomily to shake her head.\r\n\r\n"You cannot possibly be happy in the winter entirely alone," asserted\r\nanother lady, the wife of a high military authority and not accustomed\r\nto be contradicted.\r\n\r\n"But I am."\r\n\r\n"But how can you possibly be at your age? No, it is not possible."\r\n\r\n"But I _am_."\r\n\r\n"Your husband ought to bring you to town in the winter."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want to be brought to town."\r\n\r\n"And not let you waste your best years buried." "But I like being\r\nburied."\r\n\r\n"Such solitude is not right."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m not solitary."\r\n\r\n"And can come to no good." She was getting quite angry.\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of No Indeeds at her last remark, and renewed shaking\r\nof heads.\r\n\r\n"I enjoyed the winter immensely," I persisted when they were a little\r\nquieter; "I sleighed and skated, and then there were the children, and\r\nshelves and shelves full of--" I was going to say books, but stopped.\r\nReading is an occupation for men; for women it is reprehensible waste of\r\ntime. And how could I talk to them of the happiness I felt when the sun\r\nshone on the snow, or of the deep delight of hear-frost days?\r\n\r\n"It is entirely my doing that we have come down here," I proceeded, "and\r\nmy husband only did it to please me."\r\n\r\n"Such a good little wife," repeated the patronising potentate, again\r\npatting my hand with an air of understanding all about it, "really an\r\nexcellent little wife. But you must not let your husband have his own\r\nway too much, my dear, and take my advice and insist on his bringing you\r\nto town next winter." And then they fell to talking about their cooks,\r\nhaving settled to their entire satisfaction that my fate was probably\r\nlying in wait for me too, lurking perhaps at that very moment behind the\r\napparently harmless brass buttons of the man in the hall with my cloak.\r\n\r\nI laughed on the way home, and I laughed again for sheer satisfaction\r\nwhen we reached the garden and drove between the quiet trees to the\r\npretty old house; and when I went into the library, with its four\r\nwindows open to the moonlight and the scent, and looked round at the\r\nfamiliar bookshelves, and could hear no sounds but sounds of peace, and\r\nknew that here I might read or dream or idle exactly as I chose with\r\nnever a creature to disturb me, how grateful I felt to the kindly Fate\r\nthat has brought me here and given me a heart to understand my own\r\nblessedness, and rescued me from a life like that I had just seen--a\r\nlife spent with the odours of other people\'s dinners in one\'s nostrils,\r\nand the noise of their wrangling servants in one\'s ears, and parties and\r\ntattle for all amusement.\r\n\r\nBut I must confess to having felt sometimes quite crushed when some\r\ngrand person, examining the details of my home through her eyeglass, and\r\ncoolly dissecting all that I so much prize from the convenient distance\r\nof the open window, has finished up by expressing sympathy with my\r\nloneliness, and on my protesting that I like it, has murmured, "sebr\r\nanspruchslos." Then indeed I have felt ashamed of the fewness of my\r\nwants; but only for a moment, and only under the withering influence of\r\nthe eyeglass; for, after all, the owner\'s spirit is the same spirit as\r\nthat which dwells in my servants--girls whose one idea of happiness\r\nis to live in a town where there are others of their sort with whom to\r\ndrink beer and dance on Sunday afternoons. The passion for being for\r\never with one\'s fellows, and the fear of being left for a few hours\r\nalone, is to me wholly incomprehensible. I can entertain myself quite\r\nwell for weeks together, hardly aware, except for the pervading peace,\r\nthat I have been alone at all. Not but what I like to have people\r\nstaying with me for a few days, or even for a few weeks, should they be\r\nas anspruchslos as I am myself, and content with simple joys; only, any\r\none who comes here and would be happy must have something in him; if he\r\nbe a mere blank creature, empty of head and heart, he will very probably\r\nfind it dull. I should like my house to be often full if I could find\r\npeople capable of enjoying themselves. They should be welcomed and sped\r\nwith equal heartiness; for truth compels me to confess that, though it\r\npleases me to see them come, it pleases me just as much to see them go.\r\n\r\nOn some very specially divine days, like today, I have actually longed\r\nfor some one else to be here to enjoy the beauty with me. There has been\r\nrain in the night, and the whole garden seems to be singing--not the\r\nuntiring birds only, but the vigorous plants, the happy grass and trees,\r\nthe lilac bushes--oh, those lilac bushes! They are all out to-day, and\r\nthe garden is drenched with the scent. I have brought in armfuls, the\r\npicking is such a delight, and every pot and bowl and tub in the house\r\nis filled with purple glory, and the servants think there is going to be\r\na party and are extra nimble, and I go from room to room gazing at the\r\nsweetness, and the windows are all flung open so as to join the scent\r\nwithin to the scent without; and the servants gradually discover that\r\nthere is no party, and wonder why the house should be filled with\r\nflowers for one woman by herself, and I long more and more for a kindred\r\nspirit--it seems so greedy to have so much loveliness to oneself--but\r\nkindred spirits are so very, very rare; I might almost as well cry\r\nfor the moon. It is true that my garden is full of friends, only they\r\nare--dumb.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 3rd.--This is such an out-of-the-way corner of the world that\r\nit requires quite unusual energy to get here at all, and I am thus\r\ndelivered from casual callers; while, on the other hand, people I love,\r\nor people who love me, which is much the same thing, are not likely to\r\nbe deterred from coming by the roundabout train journey and the long\r\ndrive at the end. Not the least of my many blessings is that we have\r\nonly one neighbour. If you have to have neighbours at all, it is at\r\nleast a mercy that there should be only one; for with people dropping in\r\nat all hours and wanting to talk to you, how are you to get on with your\r\nlife, I should like to know, and read your books, and dream your dreams\r\nto your satisfaction? Besides, there is always the certainty that either\r\nyou or the dropper-in will say something that would have been better\r\nleft unsaid, and I have a holy horror of gossip and mischief-making. A\r\nwoman\'s tongue is a deadly weapon and the most difficult thing in the\r\nworld to keep in order, and things slip off it with a facility nothing\r\nshort of appalling at the very moment when it ought to be most quiet.\r\nIn such cases the only safe course is to talk steadily about cooks and\r\nchildren, and to pray that the visit may not be too prolonged, for if it\r\nis you are lost. Cooks I have found to be the best of all subjects--the\r\nmost phlegmatic flush into life at the mere word, and the joys and\r\nsufferings connected with them are experiences common to us all.\r\n\r\nLuckily, our neighbour and his wife are both busy and charming, with\r\na whole troop of flaxenhaired little children to keep them occupied,\r\nbesides the business of their large estate. Our intercourse is arranged\r\non lines of the most beautiful simplicity. I call on her once a year,\r\nand she returns the call a fortnight later; they ask us to dinner in the\r\nsummer, and we ask them to dinner in the winter. By strictly keeping\r\nto this, we avoid all danger of that closer friendship which is only\r\nanother name for frequent quarrels. She is a pattern of what a German\r\ncountry lady should be, and is not only a pretty woman but an energetic\r\nand practical one, and the combination is, to say the least, effective.\r\nShe is up at daylight superintending the feeding of the stock, the\r\nbutter-making, the sending off of the milk for sale; a thousand things\r\nget done while most people are fast asleep, and before lazy folk are\r\nwell at breakfast she is off in her pony-carriage to the other farms on\r\nthe place, to rate the "mamsells," as the head women are called, to poke\r\ninto every corner, lift the lids off the saucepans, count the new-laid\r\neggs, and box, if necessary, any careless dairymaid\'s ears. We are\r\nallowed by law to administer "slight corporal punishment" to our\r\nservants, it being left entirely to individual taste to decide what\r\n"slight" shall be, and my neighbour really seems to enjoy using this\r\nprivilege, judging from the way she talks about it. I would give much\r\nto be able to peep through a keyhole and see the dauntless little lady,\r\nterrible in her wrath and dignity, standing on tiptoe to box the ears of\r\nsome great strapping girl big enough to eat her.\r\n\r\nThe making of cheese and butter and sausages _excellently_ well is a\r\nwork which requires brains, and is, to my thinking, a very admirable\r\nform of activity, and entirely worthy of the attention of the\r\nintelligent. That my neighbour is intelligent is at once made evident\r\nby the bright alertness of her eyes--eyes that nothing escapes, and that\r\nonly gain in prettiness by being used to some good purpose. She is\r\na recognised authority for miles around on the mysteries of\r\nsausage-making, the care of calves, and the slaughtering of swine; and\r\nwith all her manifold duties and daily prolonged absences from home, her\r\nchildren are patterns of health and neatness, and of what dear little\r\nGerman children, with white pigtails and fearless eyes and thick\r\nlegs, should be. Who shall say that such a life is sordid and dull and\r\nunworthy of a high order of intelligence? I protest that to me it is\r\na beautiful life, full of wholesome outdoor work, and with no room for\r\nthose listless moments of depression and boredom, and of wondering what\r\nyou will do next, that leave wrinkles round a pretty woman\'s eyes,\r\nand are not unknown even to the most brilliant. But while admiring my\r\nneighbour, I don\'t think I shall ever try to follow in her steps, my\r\ntalents not being of the energetic and organising variety, but rather of\r\nthat order which makes their owner almost lamentably prone to take up a\r\nvolume of poetry and wander out to where the kingcups grow, and, sitting\r\non a willow trunk beside a little stream, forget the very existence of\r\neverything but green pastures and still waters, and the glad blowing\r\nof the wind across the joyous fields. And it would make me perfectly\r\nwretched to be confronted by ears so refractory as to require boxing.\r\n\r\nSometimes callers from a distance invade my solitude, and it is on these\r\noccasions that I realise how absolutely alone each individual is, and\r\nhow far away from his neighbour; and while they talk (generally about\r\nbabies, past, present, and to come), I fall to wondering at the vast and\r\nimpassable distance that separates one\'s own soul from the soul of\r\nthe person sitting in the next chair. I am speaking of comparative\r\nstrangers, people who are forced to stay a certain time by the\r\neccentricities of trains, and in whose presence you grope about after\r\ncommon interests and shrink back into your shell on finding that you\r\nhave none. Then a frost slowly settles down on me and I grow each minute\r\nmore benumbed and speechless, and the babies feel the frost in the air\r\nand look vacant, and the callers go through the usual form of wondering\r\nwho they most take after, generally settling the question by saying that\r\nthe May baby, who is the beauty, is like her father, and that the two\r\nmore or less plain ones are the image of me, and this decision, though\r\nI know it of old and am sure it is coming, never fails to depress me as\r\nmuch as though I heard it for the first time. The babies are very little\r\nand inoffensive and good, and it is hard that they should be used as a\r\nmeans of filling up gaps in conversation, and their features pulled to\r\npieces one by one, and all their weak points noted and criticised,\r\nwhile they stand smiling shyly in the operator\'s face, their very smile\r\ndrawing forth comments on the shape of their mouths; but, after all, it\r\ndoes not occur very often, and they are one of those few interests one\r\nhas in common with other people, as everybody seems to have babies. A\r\ngarden, I have discovered, is by no means a fruitful topic, and it is\r\namazing how few persons really love theirs--they all pretend they\r\ndo, but you can hear by the very tone of their voice what a lukewarm\r\naffection it is. About June their interest is at its warmest, nourished\r\nby agreeable supplies of strawberries and roses; but on reflection I\r\ndon\'t know a single person within twenty miles who really cares for his\r\ngarden, or has discovered the treasures of happiness that are buried in\r\nit, and are to be found if sought for diligently, and if needs be with\r\ntears. It is after these rare calls that I experience the only moments\r\nof depression from which I ever suffer, and then I am angry at myself, a\r\nwell-nourished person, for allowing even a single precious hour of life\r\nto be spoil: by anything so indifferent. That is the worst of being fed\r\nenough, and clothed enough, and warmed enough, and of having everything\r\nyou can reasonably desire--on the least provocation you are made\r\nuncomfortable and unhappy by such abstract discomforts as being shut out\r\nfrom a nearer approach to your neighbour\'s soul; which is on the face of\r\nit foolish, the probability being that he hasn\'t got one.\r\n\r\nThe rockets are all out. The gardener, in a fit of inspiration, put them\r\nright along the very front of two borders, and I don\'t know what his\r\nfeelings can be now that they are all flowering and the plants behind\r\nare completely hidden; but I have learned another lesson, and no future\r\ngardener shall be allowed to run riot among my rockets in quite so\r\nreckless a fashion. They are charming things, as delicate in colour as\r\nin scent, and a bowl of them on my writing-table fills the room with\r\nfragrance. Single rows, however, are a mistake; I had masses of them\r\nplanted in the grass, and these show how lovely they can be. A border\r\nfull of rockets, mauve and white, and nothing else, must be beautiful;\r\nbut I don\'t know how long they last nor what they look like when they\r\nhave done flowering. This I shall find out in a week or two, I suppose.\r\nWas ever a would-be gardener left so entirely to his own blundering? No\r\ndoubt it would be a gain of years to the garden if I were not forced to\r\nlearn solely by my failures, and if I had some kind creature to tell\r\nme when to do things. At present the only flowers in the garden are the\r\nrockets, the pansies in the rose beds, and two groups of azaleas--mollis\r\nand pontica. The azaleas have been and still are gorgeous; I only\r\nplanted them this spring and they almost at once began to flower, and\r\nthe sheltered corner they are in looks as though it were filled with\r\nimprisoned and perpetual sunsets. Orange, lemon, pink in every delicate\r\nshade--what they will be next year and in succeeding years when the\r\nbushes are bigger, I can imagine from the way they have begun life. On\r\ngray, dull days the effect is absolutely startling. Next autumn I shall\r\nmake a great bank of them in front of a belt of fir trees in rather a\r\ngloomy nook. My tea-roses are covered with buds which will not open for\r\nat least another week, so I conclude this is not the sort of climate\r\nwhere they will flower from the very beginning of June to November, as\r\nthey are said to do.\r\n\r\nJuly 11th.--There has been no rain since the day before Whitsunday,\r\nfive weeks ago, which partly, but not entirely, accounts for the\r\ndisappointment my beds have been. The dejected gardener went mad soon\r\nafter Whitsuntide, and had to be sent to an asylum. He took to going\r\nabout with a spade in one hand and a revolver in the other, explaining\r\nthat he felt safer that way, and we bore it quite patiently, as becomes\r\ncivilised beings who respect each other\'s prejudices, until one day,\r\nwhen I mildly asked him to tie up a fallen creeper--and after he bought\r\nthe revolver my tones in addressing him were of the mildest, and I quite\r\nleft off reading to him aloud--he turned round, looked me straight in\r\nthe face for the first time since he has been here, and said, "Do I look\r\nlike Graf X---- ----(a great local celebrity), or like a monkey?"\r\nAfter which there was nothing for it but to get him into an asylum as\r\nexpeditiously as possible. There was no gardener to be had in his place,\r\nand I have only just succeeded in getting one; so that what with the\r\ndrought, and the neglect, and the gardener\'s madness, and my blunders,\r\nthe garden is in a sad condition; but even in a sad condition it is\r\nthe dearest place in the world, and all my mistakes only make me more\r\ndetermined to persevere.\r\n\r\nThe long borders, where the rockets were, are looking dreadful. The\r\nrockets have done flowering, and, after the manner of rockets: in other\r\nwalks of life, have degenerated into sticks; and nothing else in those\r\nborders intends to bloom this summer. The giant poppies I had planted\r\nout in them in April have either died off or remained quite small, and\r\nso have the columbines; here and there a delphinium droops unwillingly,\r\nand that is all. I suppose poppies cannot stand being moved, or perhaps\r\nthey were not watered enough at the time of transplanting; anyhow, those\r\nborders are going to be sown to-morrow with more poppies for next year;\r\nfor poppies I will have, whether they like it or not, and they shall not\r\nbe touched, only thinned out.\r\n\r\nWell, it is no use being grieved, and after all, directly I come out and\r\nsit under the trees, and look at the dappled sky, and see the sunshine\r\non the cornfields away on the plain, all the disappointment smooths\r\nitself out, and it seems impossible to be sad and discontented when\r\neverything about me is so radiant and kind.\r\n\r\nTo-day is Sunday, and the garden is so quiet, that, sitting here in this\r\nshady corner watching the lazy shadows stretching themselves across the\r\ngrass, and listening to the rooks quarrelling in the treetops, I almost\r\nexpect to hear English church bells ringing for the afternoon service.\r\nBut the church is three miles off, has no bells, and no afternoon\r\nservice. Once a fortnight we go to morning prayer at eleven and sit\r\nup in a sort of private box with a room behind, whither we can retire\r\nunobserved when the sermon is too long or our flesh too weak, and hear\r\nourselves being prayed for by the blackrobed parson. In winter the\r\nchurch is bitterly cold; it is not heated, and we sit muffled up in\r\nmore furs than ever we wear out of doors; but it would of course be very\r\nwicked for the parson to wear furs, however cold he may be, so he\r\nputs on a great many extra coats under his gown, and, as the winter\r\nprogresses, swells to a prodigious size. We know when spring is coming\r\nby the reduction in his figure. The congregation sit at ease while\r\nthe parson does the praying for them, and while they are droning the\r\nlong-drawn-out chorales, he retires into a little wooden box just big\r\nenough to hold him. He does not come out until he thinks we have sung\r\nenough, nor do we stop until his appearance gives us the signal. I have\r\noften thought how dreadful it would be if he fell ill in his box and\r\nleft us to go on singing. I am sure we should never dare to stop,\r\nunauthorised by the Church. I asked him once what he did in there; he\r\nlooked very shocked at such a profane question, and made an evasive\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the garden, a German Sunday would be a terrible\r\nday; but in the garden on that day there is a sigh of relief and more\r\nprofound peace, nobody raking or sweeping or fidgeting; only the little\r\nflowers themselves and the whispering trees.\r\n\r\nI have been much afflicted again lately by visitors--not stray callers\r\nto be got rid of after a due administration of tea and things you are\r\nsorry afterwards that you said, but people staying in the house and not\r\nto be got rid of at all. All June was lost to me in this way, and it\r\nwas from first to last a radiant month of heat and beauty; but a garden\r\nwhere you meet the people you saw at breakfast, and will see again at\r\nlunch and dinner, is not a place to be happy in. Besides, they had a\r\nknack of finding out my favourite seats and lounging in them just when\r\nI longed to lounge myself; and they took books out of the library with\r\nthem, and left them face downwards on the seats all night to get well\r\ndrenched with dew, though they might have known that what is meat for\r\nroses is poison for books; and they gave me to understand that if they\r\nhad had the arranging of the garden it would have been finished long\r\nago--whereas I don\'t believe a garden ever is finished. They have all\r\ngone now, thank heaven, except one, so that I have a little breathing\r\nspace before others begin to arrive. It seems that the place interests\r\npeople, and that there is a sort of novelty in staying in such a\r\ndeserted corner of the world, for they were in a perpetual state of mild\r\namusement at being here at all. Irais is the only one left. She is a\r\nyoung woman with a beautiful, refined face, and her eyes and straight,\r\nfine eyebrows are particularly lovable. At meals she dips her bread\r\ninto the salt-cellar, bites a bit off, and repeats the process, although\r\nprovidence (taking my shape) has caused salt-spoons to be placed\r\nat convenient intervals down the table. She lunched to-day on beer,\r\nSchweine-koteletten, and cabbage-salad with caraway seeds in it, and now\r\nI hear her through the open window, extemporising touching melodies\r\nin her charming, cooing voice. She is thin, frail, intelligent, and\r\nlovable, all on the above diet. What better proof can be needed to\r\nestablish the superiority of the Teuton than the fact that after such\r\nmeals he can produce such music? Cabbage salad is a horrid invention,\r\nbut I don\'t doubt its utility as a means of encouraging thoughtfulness;\r\nnor will I quarrel with it, since it results so poetically, any more\r\nthan I quarrel with the manure that results in roses, and I give it to\r\nIrais every day to make her sing. She is the sweetest singer I have ever\r\nheard, and has a charming trick of making up songs as she goes along.\r\nWhen she begins, I go and lean out of the window and look at my little\r\nfriends out there in the borders while listening to her music, and feel\r\nfull of pleasant sadness and regret. It is so sweet to be sad when one\r\nhas nothing to be sad about.\r\n\r\nThe April baby came panting up just as I had written that, the others\r\nhurrying along behind, and with flaming cheeks displayed for my\r\nadmiration three brand-new kittens, lean and blind, that she was\r\ncarrying in her pinafore, and that had just been found motherless in the\r\nwoodshed.\r\n\r\n"Look," she cried breathlessly, "such a much!"\r\n\r\nI was glad it was only kittens this time, for she had been once before\r\nthis afternoon on purpose, as she informed me, sitting herself down on\r\nthe grass at my feet, to ask about the lieber Gott, it being Sunday and\r\nher pious little nurse\'s conversation having run, as it seems, on heaven\r\nand angels.\r\n\r\nHer questions about the lieber Gott are better left unrecorded, and I\r\nwas relieved when she began about the angels.\r\n\r\n"What do they wear for clothes?" she asked in her German-English.\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'ve seen them in pictures," I answered, "in beautiful, long\r\ndresses, and with big, white wings." "Feathers?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so,--and long dresses, all white and beautiful."\r\n\r\n"Are they girlies?"\r\n\r\n"Girls? Ye--es."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t boys go into the Himmel?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course, if they\'re good."\r\n\r\n"And then what do _they_ wear?" "Why, the same as all the other angels,\r\nI suppose."\r\n\r\n"Dwesses?"\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh, looking at me sideways as though she suspected me of\r\nmaking jokes. "What a funny Mummy!" she said, evidently much amused. She\r\nhas a fat little laugh that is very infectious.\r\n\r\n"I think," said I, gravely, "you had better go and play with the other\r\nbabies."\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, and sat still a moment watching the clouds. I began\r\nwriting again.\r\n\r\n"Mummy," she said presently.\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Where do the angels get their dwesses?"\r\n\r\nI hesitated. "From lieber Gott," I said.\r\n\r\n"Are there shops in the Himmel?"\r\n\r\n"Shops? No."\r\n\r\n"But, then, where does lieber Gott buy their dwesses?"\r\n\r\n"Now run away like a good baby; I\'m busy."\r\n\r\n"But you said yesterday, when I asked about lieber Gott, that you would\r\ntell about Him on Sunday, and it is Sunday. Tell me a story about Him."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but resignation, so I put down my pencil with a\r\nsigh. "Call the others, then."\r\n\r\nShe ran away, and presently they all three emerged from the bushes one\r\nafter the other, and tried all together to scramble on to my knee. The\r\nApril baby got the knee as she always seems to get everything, and the\r\nother two had to sit on the grass.\r\n\r\nI began about Adam and Eve, with an eye to future parsonic probings. The\r\nApril baby\'s eyes opened wider and wider, and her face grew redder\r\nand redder. I was surprised at the breathless interest she took in\r\nthe story--the other two were tearing up tufts of grass and hardly\r\nlistening. I had scarcely got to the angels with the flaming swords and\r\nannounced that that was all, when she burst out, "Now I\'ll tell about\r\nit. Once upon a time there was Adam and Eva, and they had plenty of\r\nclothes, and there was no snake, and lieber Gott wasn\'t angry with them,\r\nand they could eat as many apples as they liked, and was happy for ever\r\nand ever--there now!"\r\n\r\nShe began to jump up and down defiantly on my knee.\r\n\r\n"But that\'s not the story," I said rather helplessly. "Yes, yes! It\'s a\r\nmuch nicelier one! Now another."\r\n\r\n"But these stories are true," I said severely; "and it\'s no use my\r\ntelling them if you make them up your own way afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Another! another!" she shrieked, jumping up and down with redoubled\r\nenergy, all her silvery curls flying.\r\n\r\nI began about Noah and the flood.\r\n\r\n"Did it rain so badly?" she asked with a face of the deepest concern and\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"Yes, all day long and all night long for weeks and weeks----"\r\n\r\n"And was everybody so wet?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--"\r\n\r\n"But why didn\'t they open their umbwellas?"\r\n\r\nJust then I saw the nurse coming out with the tea-tray.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you the rest another time," I said, putting her off my knee,\r\ngreatly relieved; "you must all go to Anna now and have tea."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like Anna," remarked the June baby, not having hitherto opened\r\nher lips; "she is a stupid girl."\r\n\r\nThe other two stood transfixed with horror at this statement, for,\r\nbesides being naturally extremely polite, and at all times anxious not\r\nto hurt any one\'s feelings, they had been brought up to love and respect\r\ntheir kind little nurse.\r\n\r\nThe April baby recovered her speech first, and lifting her finger,\r\npointed it at the criminal in just indignation. "Such a child will never\r\ngo into the Himmel," she said with great emphasis, and the air of one\r\nwho delivers judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 15th.--This is the month of quiet days, crimson creepers, and\r\nblackberries; of mellow afternoons in the ripening garden; of tea under\r\nthe acacias instead of the too shady beeches; of wood-fires in the\r\nlibrary in the chilly evenings. The babies go out in the afternoon and\r\nblackberry in the hedges; the three kittens, grown big and fat, sit\r\ncleaning themselves on the sunny verandah steps; the Man of Wrath shoots\r\npartridges across the distant stubble; and the summer seems as though it\r\nwould dream on for ever. It is hard to believe that in three months we\r\nshall probably be snowed up and certainly be cold. There is a feeling\r\nabout this month that reminds me of March and the early days of April,\r\nwhen spring is still hesitating on the threshold and the garden holds\r\nits breath in expectation. There is the same mildness in the air, and\r\nthe sky and grass have the same look as then; but the leaves tell\r\na different tale, and the reddening creeper on the house is rapidly\r\napproaching its last and loveliest glory.\r\n\r\nMy roses have behaved as well on the whole as was to be expected,\r\nand the Viscountess Folkestones and Laurette Messimys have been most\r\nbeautiful, the latter being quite the loveliest things in the garden,\r\neach flower an exquisite loose cluster of coral-pink petals, paling at\r\nthe base to a yellow-white. I have ordered a hundred standard tea-roses\r\nfor planting next month, half of which are Viscountess Folkestones,\r\nbecause the tea-roses have such a way of hanging their little heads\r\nthat one has to kneel down to be able to see them well in the dwarf\r\nforms--not but what I entirely approve of kneeling before such perfect\r\nbeauty, only it dirties one\'s clothes. So I am going to put standards\r\ndown each side of the walk under the south windows, and shall have the\r\nflowers on a convenient level for worship. My only fear is, that they\r\nwill stand the winter less well than the dwarf sorts, being so difficult\r\nto pack up snugly. The Persian Yellows and Bicolors have been, as I\r\npredicted, a mistake among the tea-roses; they only flower twice in the\r\nseason and all the rest of the time look dull and moping; and then the\r\nPersian Yellows have such an odd smell and so many insects inside them\r\neating them up. I have ordered Safrano tea-roses to put in their place,\r\nas they all come out next month and are to be grouped in the grass; and\r\nthe semicircle being immediately under the windows, besides having the\r\nbest position in the place, must be reserved solely for my choicest\r\ntreasures. I have had a great many disappointments, but feel as though\r\nI were really beginning to learn. Humility, and the most patient\r\nperseverance, seem almost as necessary in gardening as rain and\r\nsunshine, and every failure must be used as a stepping-stone to\r\nsomething better.\r\n\r\nI had a visitor last week who knows a great deal about gardening and\r\nhas had much practical experience. When I heard he was coming, I felt\r\nI wanted to put my arms right round my garden and hide it from him; but\r\nwhat was my surprise and delight when he said, after having gone all\r\nover it, "Well, I think you have done wonders." Dear me, how pleased I\r\nwas! It was so entirely unexpected, and such a complete novelty after\r\nthe remarks I have been listening to all the summer. I could have hugged\r\nthat discerning and indulgent critic, able to look beyond the result to\r\nthe intention, and appreciating the difficulties of every kind that\r\nhad been in the way. After that I opened my heart to him, and listened\r\nreverently to all he had to say, and treasured up his kind and\r\nencouraging advice, and wished he could stay here a whole year and help\r\nme through the seasons. But he went, as people one likes always do go,\r\nand he was the only guest I have had whose departure made me sorry.\r\n\r\nThe people I love are always somewhere else and not able to come to me,\r\nwhile I can at any time fill the house with visitors about whom I know\r\nlittle and care less. Perhaps, if I saw more of those absent ones, I\r\nwould not love them so well--at least, that is what I think on wet days\r\nwhen the wind is howling round the house and all nature is overcome with\r\ngrief; and it has actually happened once or twice when great friends\r\nhave been staying with me that I have wished, when they left, I might\r\nnot see them again for at least ten years. I suppose the fact is, that\r\nno friendship can stand the breakfast test, and here, in the country,\r\nwe invariably think it our duty to appear at breakfast. Civilisation has\r\ndone away with curl-papers, yet at that hour the soul of the Hausfrau\r\nis as tightly screwed up in them as was ever her grandmother\'s hair; and\r\nthough my body comes down mechanically, having been trained that way by\r\npunctual parents, my soul never thinks of beginning to wake up for other\r\npeople till lunch-time, and never does so completely till it has been\r\ntaken out of doors and aired in the sunshine. Who can begin conventional\r\namiability the first thing in the morning? It is the hour of savage\r\ninstincts and natural tendencies; it is the triumph of the Disagreeable\r\nand the Cross. I am convinced that the Muses and the Graces never\r\nthought of having breakfast anywhere but in bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 11th.--When the gray November weather came, and hung its soft\r\ndark clouds low and unbroken over the brown of the ploughed fields and\r\nthe vivid emerald of the stretches of winter corn, the heavy stillness\r\nweighed my heart down to a forlorn yearning after the pleasant things\r\nof childhood, the petting, the comforting, the warming faith in the\r\nunfailing wisdom of elders. A great need of something to lean on, and a\r\ngreat weariness of independence and responsibility took possession of my\r\nsoul; and looking round for support and comfort in that transitory mood,\r\nthe emptiness of the present and the blankness of the future sent me\r\nback to the past with all its ghosts. Why should I not go and see the\r\nplace where I was born, and where I lived so long; the place where I was\r\nso magnificently happy, so exquisitely wretched, so close to heaven,\r\nso near to hell, always either up on a cloud of glory, or down in the\r\ndepths with the waters of despair closing over my head? Cousins live in\r\nit now, distant cousins, loved with the exact measure of love usually\r\nbestowed on cousins who reign in one\'s stead; cousins of practical\r\nviews, who have dug up the flower-beds and planted cabbages where roses\r\ngrew; and though through all the years since my father\'s death I have\r\nheld my head so high that it hurt, and loftily refused to listen to\r\ntheir repeated suggestions that I should revisit my old home, something\r\nin the sad listlessness of the November days sent my spirit back to old\r\ntimes with a persistency that would not be set aside, and I woke from\r\nmy musings surprised to find myself sick with longing. It is foolish\r\nbut natural to quarrel with one\'s cousins, and especially foolish and\r\nnatural when they have done nothing, and are mere victims of chance.\r\nIs it their fault that my not being a boy placed the shoes I should\r\notherwise have stepped into at their disposal? I know it is not; but\r\ntheir blamelessness does not make me love them more. "Noch ein dummes\r\nFrauenzimmer!" cried my father, on my arrival into the world--he\r\nhad three of them already, and I was his last hope,--and a dummes\r\nFrauenzimmer I have remained ever since; and that is why for years I\r\nwould have no dealings with the cousins in possession, and that is why,\r\nthe other day, overcome by the tender influence of the weather, the\r\npurely sentimental longing to join hands again with my childhood was\r\nenough to send all my pride to the winds, and to start me off without\r\nwarning and without invitation on my pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nI have always had a liking for pilgrimages, and if I had lived in the\r\nMiddle Ages would have spent most of my time on the way to Rome. The\r\npilgrims, leaving all their cares at home, the anxieties of their riches\r\nor their debts, the wife that worried and the children that disturbed,\r\ntook only their sins with them, and turning their backs on their\r\nobligations, set out with that sole burden, and perhaps a cheerful\r\nheart. How cheerful my heart would have been, starting on a fine\r\nmorning, with the smell of the spring in my nostrils, fortified by the\r\napproval of those left behind, accompanied by the pious blessings of my\r\nfamily, with every step getting farther from the suffocation of daily\r\nduties, out into the wide fresh world, out into the glorious free world,\r\nso poor, so penitent, and so happy! My dream, even now, is to walk for\r\nweeks with some friend that I love, leisurely wandering from place to\r\nplace, with no route arranged and no object in view, with liberty to\r\ngo on all day or to linger all day, as we choose; but the question of\r\nluggage, unknown to the simple pilgrim, is one of the rocks on which\r\nmy plans have been shipwrecked, and the other is the certain censure of\r\nrelatives, who, not fond of walking themselves, and having no taste for\r\nnoonday naps under hedges, would be sure to paralyse my plans before\r\nthey had grown to maturity by the honest horror of their cry, "How very\r\nunpleasant if you were to meet any one you know!" The relative of five\r\nhundred years back would simply have said, "How holy!"\r\n\r\nMy father had the same liking for pilgrimages--indeed, it is evident\r\nthat I have it from him--and he encouraged it in me when I was little,\r\ntaking me with him on his pious journeys to places he had lived in as a\r\nboy. Often have we been together to the school he was at in Brandenburg,\r\nand spent pleasant days wandering about the old town on the edge of one\r\nof those lakes that lie in a chain in that wide green plain; and often\r\nhave we been in Potsdam, where he was quartered as a lieutenant, the\r\nPotsdam pilgrimage including hours in the woods around and in the\r\ngardens of Sans Souci, with the second volume of Carlyle\'s Frederick\r\nunder my father\'s arm; and often did we spend long summer days at the\r\nhouse in the Mark, at the head of the same blue chain of lakes, where\r\nhis mother spent her young years, and where, though it belonged to\r\ncousins, like everything else that was worth having, we could wander\r\nabout as we chose, for it was empty, and sit in the deep windows of\r\nrooms where there was no furniture, and the painted Venuses and cupids\r\non the ceiling still smiled irrelevantly and stretched their futile\r\nwreaths above the emptiness beneath. And while we sat and rested, my\r\nfather told me, as my grandmother had a hundred times told him, all that\r\nhad happened in those rooms in the far-off days when people danced\r\nand sang and laughed through life, and nobody seemed ever to be old or\r\nsorry.\r\n\r\nThere was, and still is, an inn within a stone\'s throw of the great iron\r\ngates, with two very old lime trees in front of it, where we used to\r\nlunch on our arrival at a little table spread with a red and blue check\r\ncloth, the lime blossoms dropping into our soup, and the bees humming in\r\nthe scented shadows overhead. I have a picture of the house by my side\r\nas I write, done from the lake in old times, with a boat full of ladies\r\nin hoops and powder in the foreground, and a youth playing a guitar. The\r\npilgrimages to this place were those I loved the best.\r\n\r\nBut the stories my father told me, sometimes odd enough stories to tell\r\na little girl, as we wandered about the echoing rooms, or hung over\r\nthe stone balustrade and fed the fishes in the lake, or picked the pale\r\ndog-roses in the hedges, or lay in the boat in a shady reed-grown\r\nbay while he smoked to keep the mosquitoes off, were after all only\r\ntraditions, imparted to me in small doses from time to time, when his\r\nearnest desire not to raise his remarks above the level of dulness\r\nsupposed to be wholesome for Backfische was neutralised by an impulse\r\nto share his thoughts with somebody who would laugh; whereas the place I\r\nwas bound for on my latest pilgrimage was filled with living, first-hand\r\nmemories of all the enchanted years that lie between two and eighteen.\r\nHow enchanted those years are is made more and more clear to me the\r\nolder I grow. There has been nothing in the least like them since; and\r\nthough I have forgotten most of what happened six months ago, every\r\nincident, almost every day of those wonderful long years is perfectly\r\ndistinct in my memory.\r\n\r\nBut I had been stiffnecked, proud, unpleasant, altogether cousinly in my\r\nbehaviour towards the people in possession. The invitations to revisit\r\nthe old home had ceased. The cousins had grown tired of refusals, and\r\nhad left me alone. I did not even know who lived in it now, it was so\r\nlong since I had had any news. For two days I fought against the strong\r\ndesire to go there that had suddenly seized me, and assured myself that\r\nI would not go, that it would be absurd to go, undignified, sentimental,\r\nand silly, that I did not know them and would be in an awkward position,\r\nand that I was old enough to know better. But who can foretell from\r\none hour to the next what a woman will do? And when does she ever know\r\nbetter? On the third morning I set out as hopefully as though it were\r\nthe most natural thing in the world to fall unexpectedly upon hitherto\r\nconsistently neglected cousins, and expect to be received with open\r\narms.\r\n\r\nIt was a complicated journey, and lasted several hours. During the first\r\npart, when it was still dark, I glowed with enthusiasm, with the spirit\r\nof adventure, with delight at the prospect of so soon seeing the loved\r\nplace again; and thought with wonder of the long years I had allowed to\r\npass since last I was there. Of what I should say to the cousins, and of\r\nhow I should introduce myself into their midst, I did not think at all:\r\nthe pilgrim spirit was upon me, the unpractical spirit that takes\r\nno thought for anything, but simply wanders along enjoying its own\r\nemotions. It was a quiet, sad morning, and there was a thick mist. By\r\nthe time I was in the little train on the light railway that passed\r\nthrough the village nearest my old home, I had got over my first\r\nenthusiasm, and had entered the stage of critically examining the\r\nchanges that had been made in the last ten years. It was so misty that\r\nI could see nothing of the familiar country from the carriage windows,\r\nonly the ghosts of pines in the front row of the forests; but the\r\nrailway itself was a new departure, unknown in our day, when we used\r\nto drive over ten miles of deep, sandy forest roads to and from the\r\nstation, and although most people would have called it an evident and\r\ngreat improvement, it was an innovation due, no doubt, to the zeal and\r\nenergy of the reigning cousin; and who was he, thought I, that he should\r\nrequire more conveniences than my father had found needful? It was no\r\nuse my telling myself that in my father\'s time the era of light railways\r\nhad not dawned, and that if it had, we should have done our utmost to\r\nsecure one; the thought of my cousin, stepping into my shoes, and then\r\naltering them, was odious to me. By the time I was walking up the hill\r\nfrom the station I had got over this feeling too, and had entered a\r\nthird stage of wondering uneasily what in the world I should do next.\r\nWhere was the intrepid courage with which I had started? At the top of\r\nthe first hill I sat down to consider this question in detail, for I was\r\nvery near the house now, and felt I wanted time. Where, indeed, was the\r\ncourage and joy of the morning? It had vanished so completely that I\r\ncould only suppose that it must be lunch time, the observations of years\r\nhaving led to the discovery that the higher sentiments and virtues fly\r\naffrighted on the approach of lunch, and none fly quicker than courage.\r\nSo I ate the lunch I had brought with me, hoping that it was what I\r\nwanted; but it was chilly, made up of sandwiches and pears, and it had\r\nto be eaten under a tree at the edge of a field; and it was November,\r\nand the mist was thicker than ever and very wet--the grass was wet\r\nwith it, the gaunt tree was wet with it, I was wet with it, and the\r\nsandwiches were wet with it. Nobody\'s spirits can keep up under such\r\nconditions; and as I ate the soaked sandwiches, I deplored the headlong\r\ncourage more with each mouthful that had torn me from a warm, dry home\r\nwhere I was appreciated, and had brought me first to the damp tree in\r\nthe damp field, and when I had finished my lunch and dessert of cold\r\npears, was going to drag me into the midst of a circle of unprepared and\r\nastonished cousins. Vast sheep loomed through the mist a few yards off.\r\nThe sheep dog kept up a perpetual, irritating yap. In the fog I could\r\nhardly tell where I was, though I knew I must have played there a\r\nhundred times as a child. After the fashion of woman directly she is\r\nnot perfectly warm and perfectly comfortable, I began to consider the\r\nuncertainty of human life, and to shake my head in gloomy approval as\r\nlugubrious lines of pessimistic poetry suggested themselves to my mind.\r\n\r\nNow it is clearly a desirable plan, if you want to do anything, to do\r\nit in the way consecrated by custom, more especially if you are a woman.\r\nThe rattle of a carriage along the road just behind me, and the fact\r\nthat I started and turned suddenly hot, drove this truth home to my\r\nsoul. The mist hid me, and the carriage, no doubt full of cousins, drove\r\non in the direction of the house; but what an absurd position I was in!\r\nSuppose the kindly mist had lifted, and revealed me lunching in the\r\nwet on their property, the cousin of the short and lofty letters, the\r\nunangenehme Elisabeth! "Die war doch immer verdreht," I could imagine\r\nthem hastily muttering to each other, before advancing wreathed in\r\nwelcoming smiles. It gave me a great shock, this narrow escape, and I\r\ngot on to my feet quickly, and burying the remains of my lunch under the\r\ngigantic molehill on which I had been sitting, asked myself nervously\r\nwhat I proposed to do next. Should I walk back to the village, go to the\r\nGasthof, write a letter craving permission to call on my cousins, and\r\nwait there till an answer came? It would be a discreet and sober course\r\nto pursue; the next best thing to having written before leaving home.\r\nBut the Gasthof of a north German village is a dreadful place, and the\r\nremembrance of one in which I had taken refuge once from a thunderstorm\r\nwas still so vivid that nature itself cried out against this plan. The\r\nmist, if anything, was growing denser. I knew every path and gate in the\r\nplace. What if I gave up all hope of seeing the house, and went through\r\nthe little door in the wall at the bottom of the garden, and confined\r\nmyself for this once to that? In such weather I would be able to wander\r\nround as I pleased, without the least risk of being seen by or meeting\r\nany cousins, and it was after all the garden that lay nearest my heart.\r\nWhat a delight it would be to creep into it unobserved, and revisit all\r\nthe corners I so well remembered, and slip out again and get away safely\r\nwithout any need of explanations, assurances, protestations, displays\r\nof affection, without any need, in a word, of that exhausting form\r\nof conversation, so dear to relations, known as Redensarten! The mist\r\ntempted me. I think if it had been a fine day I would have gone soberly\r\nto the Gasthof and written the conciliatory letter; but the temptation\r\nwas too great, it was altogether irresistible, and in ten minutes I had\r\nfound the gate, opened it with some difficulty, and was standing with a\r\nbeating heart in the garden of my childhood.\r\n\r\nNow I wonder whether I shall ever again feel thrills of the same\r\npotency as those that ran through me at that moment. First of all I was\r\ntrespassing, which is in itself thrilling; but how much more thrilling\r\nwhen you are trespassing on what might just as well have been your own\r\nground, on what actually was for years your own ground, and when you are\r\nin deadly peril of seeing the rightful owners, whom you have never\r\nmet, but with whom you have quarrelled, appear round the corner, and\r\nof hearing them remark with an inquiring and awful politeness "I do\r\nnot think I have the pleasure--?" Then the place was unchanged. I was\r\nstanding in the same mysterious tangle of damp little paths that had\r\nalways been just there; they curled away on either side among the\r\nshrubs, with the brown tracks of recent footsteps in the centre of their\r\ngreen stains, just as they did in my day. The overgrown lilac bushes\r\nstill met above my head. The moisture dripped from the same ledge in\r\nthe wall on to the sodden leaves beneath, as it had done all through the\r\nafternoons of all those past Novembers. This was the place, this damp\r\nand gloomy tangle, that had specially belonged to me. Nobody ever\r\ncame to it, for in winter it was too dreary, and in summer so full of\r\nmosquitoes that only a Backfisch indifferent to spots could have borne\r\nit. But it was a place where I could play unobserved, and where I could\r\nwalk up and down uninterrupted for hours, building castles in the\r\nair. There was an unwholesome little arbour in one dark corner, much\r\nfrequented by the larger black slug, where I used to pass glorious\r\nafternoons making plans. I was for ever making plans, and if nothing\r\ncame of them, what did it matter? The mere making had been a joy. To\r\nme this out-of-the-way corner was always a wonderful and a mysterious\r\nplace, where my castles in the air stood close together in radiant rows,\r\nand where the strangest and most splendid adventures befell me; for the\r\nhours I passed in it and the people I met in it were all enchanted.\r\n\r\nStanding there and looking round with happy eyes, I forgot the existence\r\nof the cousins. I could have cried for joy at being there again. It was\r\nthe home of my fathers, the home that would have been mine if I had been\r\na boy, the home that was mine now by a thousand tender and happy and\r\nmiserable associations, of which the people in possession could not\r\ndream. They were tenants, but it was my home. I threw my arms round the\r\ntrunk of a very wet fir tree, every branch of which I remembered, for\r\nhad I not climbed it, and fallen from it, and torn and bruised myself on\r\nit uncountable numbers of times? and I gave it such a hearty kiss that\r\nmy nose and chin were smudged into one green stain, and still I did not\r\ncare. Far from caring, it filled me with a reckless, Backfisch pleasure\r\nin being dirty, a delicious feeling that I had not had for years. Alice\r\nin Wonderland, after she had drunk the contents of the magic bottle,\r\ncould not have grown smaller more suddenly than I grew younger the\r\nmoment I passed through that magic door. Bad habits cling to us,\r\nhowever, with such persistency that I did mechanically pull out my\r\nhandkerchief and begin to rub off the welcoming smudge, a thing I never\r\nwould have dreamed of doing in the glorious old days; but an artful\r\nscent of violets clinging to the handkerchief brought me to my senses,\r\nand with a sudden impulse of scorn, the fine scorn for scent of every\r\nhonest Backfisch, I rolled it up into a ball and flung it away into the\r\nbushes, where I daresay it is at this moment. "Away with you," I cried,\r\n"away with you, symbol of conventionality, of slavery, of pandering to\r\na desire to please--away with you, miserable little lace-edged rag!"\r\nAnd so young had I grown within the last few minutes that I did not even\r\nfeel silly.\r\n\r\nAs a Backfisch I had never used handkerchiefs--the child of nature\r\nscorns to blow its nose--though for decency\'s sake my governess insisted\r\non giving me a clean one of vast size and stubborn texture on Sundays.\r\nIt was stowed away unfolded in the remotest corner of my pocket, where\r\nit was gradually pressed into a beautiful compactness by the other\r\ncontents, which were knives. After a while, I remember, the handkerchief\r\nbeing brought to light on Sundays to make room for a successor, and\r\nbeing manifestly perfectly clean, we came to an agreement that it\r\nshould only be changed on the first and third Sundays in the month, on\r\ncondition that I promised to turn it on the other Sundays. My governess\r\nsaid that the outer folds became soiled from the mere contact with the\r\nother things in my pocket, and that visitors might catch sight of the\r\nsoiled side if it was never turned when I wished to blow my nose in\r\ntheir presence, and that one had no right to give one\'s visitors shocks.\r\n"But I never do wish----" I began with great earnestness. "Unsinn," said\r\nmy governess, cutting me short.\r\n\r\nAfter the first thrills of joy at being there again had gone, the\r\nprofound stillness of the dripping little shrubbery frightened me. It\r\nwas so still that I was afraid to move; so still, that I could count\r\neach drop of moisture falling from the oozing wall; so still, that when\r\nI held my breath to listen, I was deafened by my own heart-beats. I made\r\na step forward in the direction where the arbour ought to be, and the\r\nrustling and jingling of my clothes terrified me into immobility. The\r\nhouse was only two hundred yards off; and if any one had been about,\r\nthe noise I had already made opening the creaking door and so foolishly\r\napostrophising my handkerchief must have been noticed. Suppose an\r\ninquiring gardener, or a restless cousin, should presently loom through\r\nthe fog, bearing down upon me? Suppose Fraulein Wundermacher should\r\npounce upon me suddenly from behind, coming up noiselessly in her\r\ngaloshes, and shatter my castles with her customary triumphant "Fetzt\r\nhalte ich dich aber fest!" Why, what was I thinking of? Fraulein\r\nWundermacher, so big and masterful, such an enemy of day-dreams, such\r\na friend of das Praktische, such a lover of creature comforts, had died\r\nlong ago, had been succeeded long ago by others, German sometimes, and\r\nsometimes English, and sometimes at intervals French, and they too had\r\nall in their turn vanished, and I was here a solitary ghost. "Come,\r\nElizabeth," said I to myself impatiently, "are you actually growing\r\nsentimental over your governesses? If you think you are a ghost, be glad\r\nat least that you are a solitary one. Would you like the ghosts of\r\nall those poor women you tormented to rise up now in this gloomy place\r\nagainst you? And do you intend to stand here till you are caught?" And\r\nthus exhorting myself to action, and recognising how great was the risk\r\nI ran in lingering, I started down the little path leading to the arbour\r\nand the principal part of the garden, going, it is true, on tiptoe, and\r\nvery much frightened by the rustling of my petticoats, but determined to\r\nsee what I had come to see and not to be scared away by phantoms.\r\n\r\nHow regretfully did I think at that moment of the petticoats of my\r\nyouth, so short, so silent, and so woollen! And how convenient the\r\ncanvas shoes were with the india rubber soles, for creeping about\r\nwithout making a sound! Thanks to them I could always run swiftly and\r\nunheard into my hiding-places, and stay there listening to the garden\r\nresounding with cries of "Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Come in at once to your\r\nlessons!" Or, at a different period, "Ou etes-vous donc, petite sotte?"\r\nOr at yet another period, "Warte nur, wenn ich dich erst habe!" As the\r\nvoices came round one corner, I whisked in my noiseless clothes round\r\nthe next, and it was only Fraulein Wundermacher, a person of resource,\r\nwho discovered that all she needed for my successful circumvention was\r\ngaloshes. She purchased a pair, wasted no breath calling me, and would\r\ncome up silently, as I stood lapped in a false security lost in the\r\ncontemplation of a squirrel or a robin, and seize me by the shoulders\r\nfrom behind, to the grievous unhinging of my nerves. Stealing along\r\nin the fog, I looked back uneasily once or twice, so vivid was this\r\ndisquieting memory, and could hardly be reassured by putting up my hand\r\nto the elaborate twists and curls that compose what my maid calls my\r\nFrisur, and that mark the gulf lying between the present and the past;\r\nfor it had happened once or twice, awful to relate and to remember, that\r\nFraulein Wundermacher, sooner than let me slip through her fingers, had\r\nactually caught me by the long plait of hair to whose other end I was\r\nattached and whose English name I had been told was pigtail, just at the\r\ninstant when I was springing away from her into the bushes; and so\r\nhad led me home triumphant, holding on tight to the rope of hair, and\r\nmuttering with a broad smile of special satisfaction, "Diesmal wirst du\r\nmir aber nicht entschlupfen!" Fraulein Wundermacher, now I came to think\r\nof it, must have been a humourist. She was certainly a clever and a\r\ncapable woman. But I wished at that moment that she would not haunt me\r\nso persistently, and that I could get rid of the feeling that she was\r\njust behind in her galoshes, with her hand stretched out to seize me.\r\nPassing the arbour, and peering into its damp recesses, I started back\r\nwith my heart in my mouth. I thought I saw my grandfather\'s stern eyes\r\nshining in the darkness. It was evident that my anxiety lest the cousins\r\nshould catch me had quite upset my nerves, for I am not by nature\r\ninclined to see eyes where eyes are not. "Don\'t be foolish, Elizabeth,"\r\nmurmured my soul in rather a faint voice, "go in, and make sure." "But\r\nI don\'t like going in and making sure," I replied. I did go in, however,\r\nwith a sufficient show of courage, and fortunately the eyes vanished.\r\nWhat I should have done if they had not I am altogether unable to\r\nimagine. Ghosts are things that I laugh at in the daytime and fear at\r\nnight, but I think if I were to meet one I should die. The arbour had\r\nfallen into great decay, and was in the last stage of mouldiness. My\r\ngrandfather had had it made, and, like other buildings, it enjoyed\r\na period of prosperity before being left to the ravages of slugs and\r\nchildren, when he came down every afternoon in summer and drank his\r\ncoffee there and read his Kreuzzeitung and dozed, while the rest of us\r\nwent about on tiptoe, and only the birds dared sing. Even the mosquitoes\r\nthat infested the place were too much in awe of him to sting him; they\r\ncertainly never did sting him, and I naturally concluded it must be\r\nbecause he had forbidden such familiarities. Although I had played there\r\nfor so many years since his death, my memory skipped them all, and went\r\nback to the days when it was exclusively his. Standing on the spot\r\nwhere his armchair used to be, I felt how well I knew him now from the\r\nimpressions he made then on my child\'s mind, though I was not conscious\r\nof them for more than twenty years. Nobody told me about him, and he\r\ndied when I was six, and yet within the last year or two, that strange\r\nIndian summer of remembrance that comes to us in the leisured times when\r\nthe children have been born and we have time to think, has made me\r\nknow him perfectly well. It is rather an uncomfortable thought for\r\nthe grown-up, and especially for the parent, but of a salutary and\r\nrestraining nature, that though children may not understand what is said\r\nand done before them, and have no interest in it at the time, and though\r\nthey may forget it at once and for years, yet these things that they\r\nhave seen and heard and not noticed have after all impressed themselves\r\nfor ever on their minds, and when they are men and women come crowding\r\nback with surprising and often painful distinctness, and away frisk all\r\nthe cherished little illusions in flocks.\r\n\r\nI had an awful reverence for my grandfather. He never petted, and he\r\noften frowned, and such people are generally reverenced. Besides, he was\r\na just man, everybody said; a just man who might have been a great man\r\nif he had chosen, and risen to almost any pinnacle of worldly glory.\r\nThat he had not so chosen was held to be a convincing proof of his\r\ngreatness; for he was plainly too great to be great in the vulgar sense,\r\nand shrouded himself in the dignity of privacy and potentialities. This,\r\nat least, as time passed and he still did nothing, was the belief of the\r\nsimple people around. People must believe in somebody, and having pinned\r\ntheir faith on my grandfather in the promising years that lie round\r\nthirty, it was more convenient to let it remain there. He pervaded\r\nour family life till my sixth year, and saw to it that we all behaved\r\nourselves, and then he died, and we were glad that he should be in\r\nheaven. He was a good German (and when Germans are good they are very\r\ngood) who kept the commandments, voted for the Government, grew prize\r\npotatoes and bred innumerable sheep, drove to Berlin once a year with\r\nthe wool in a procession of waggons behind him and sold it at the annual\r\nWollmarkt, rioted soberly for a few days there, and then carried most\r\nof the proceeds home, hunted as often as possible, helped his friends,\r\npunished his children, read his Bible, said his prayers, and was\r\ngenuinely astonished when his wife had the affectation to die of a\r\nbroken heart. I cannot pretend to explain this conduct. She ought, of\r\ncourse, to have been happy in the possession of so good a man; but good\r\nmen are sometimes oppressive, and to have one in the house with you\r\nand to live in the daily glare of his goodness must be a tremendous\r\nbusiness. After bearing him seven sons and three daughters, therefore,\r\nmy grandmother died in the way described, and afforded, said my\r\ngrandfather, another and a very curious proof of the impossibility\r\nof ever being sure of your ground with women. The incident faded more\r\nquickly from his mind than it might otherwise have done for its having\r\noccurred simultaneously with the production of a new kind of potato, of\r\nwhich he was justly proud. He called it Trost in Trauer, and quoted the\r\ntext of Scripture Auge um Auge, Zabn um Zahn, after which he did not\r\nagain allude to his wife\'s decease. In his last years, when my father\r\nmanaged the estate, and he only lived with us and criticised, he came to\r\nhave the reputation of an oracle. The neighbours sent him their sons\r\nat the beginning of any important phase in their lives, and he received\r\nthem in this very arbour, administering eloquent and minute advice in\r\nthe deep voice that rolled round the shrubbery and filled me with a\r\nvague sense of guilt as I played. Sitting among the bushes playing\r\nmuffled games for fear of disturbing him, I supposed he must be reading\r\naloud, so unbroken was the monotony of that majestic roll. The young men\r\nused to come out again bathed in perspiration, much stung by mosquitoes,\r\nand looking bewildered; and when they had got over the impression made\r\nby my grandfather\'s speech and presence, no doubt forgot all he had\r\nsaid with wholesome quickness, and set themselves to the interesting and\r\nnecessary work of gaining their own experience. Once, indeed, a dreadful\r\nthing happened, whose immediate consequence was the abrupt end to the\r\nlong and close friendship between us and our nearest neighbour. His son\r\nwas brought to the arbour and left there in the usual way, and either he\r\nmust have happened on the critical half hour after the coffee and before\r\nthe Kreuzzeitung, when my grandfather was accustomed to sleep, or he\r\nwas more courageous than the others and tried to talk, for very shortly,\r\nplaying as usual near at hand, I heard my grandfather\'s voice, raised to\r\nan extent that made me stop in my game and quake, saying with deliberate\r\nanger, "Hebe dich weg von mir, Sohn des Satans!" Which was all the\r\nadvice this particular young man got, and which he hastened to take, for\r\nout he came through the bushes, and though his face was very pale, there\r\nwas an odd twist about the corners of his mouth that reassured me.\r\n\r\nThis must have happened quite at the end of my grandfather\'s life, for\r\nalmost immediately afterwards, as it now seems to me, he died before he\r\nneed have done because he would eat crab, a dish that never agreed with\r\nhim, in the face of his doctor\'s warning that if he did he would surely\r\ndie. "What! am I to be conquered by crabs?" he demanded indignantly of\r\nthe doctor; for apart from loving them with all his heart he had never\r\nyet been conquered by anything. "Nay, sir, the combat is too unequal--do\r\nnot, I pray you, try it again," replied the doctor. But my grandfather\r\nordered crabs that very night for supper, and went in to table with the\r\nshining eyes of one who is determined to conquer or die, and the crabs\r\nconquered, and he died. "He was a just man," said the neighbours, except\r\nthat nearest neighbour, formerly his best friend, "and might have been a\r\ngreat one had he so chosen." And they buried him with profound respect,\r\nand the sunshine came into our home life with a burst, and the birds\r\nwere not the only creatures that sang, and the arbour, from having been\r\na temple of Delphic utterances, sank into a home for slugs.\r\n\r\nMusing on the strangeness of life, and on the invariable ultimate\r\ntriumph of the insignificant and small over the important and vast,\r\nillustrated in this instance by the easy substitution in the arbour of\r\nslugs for grandfathers, I went slowly round the next bend of the\r\npath, and came to the broad walk along the south side of the high wall\r\ndividing the flower garden from the kitchen garden, in which sheltered\r\nposition my father had had his choicest flowers. Here the cousins had\r\nbeen at work, and all the climbing roses that clothed the wall with\r\nbeauty were gone, and some very neat fruit trees, tidily nailed up at\r\nproper intervals, reigned in their stead. Evidently the cousins knew\r\nthe value of this warm aspect, for in the border beneath, filled in my\r\nfather\'s time in this month of November with the wallflowers that were\r\nto perfume the walk in spring, there was a thick crop of--I stooped down\r\nclose to make sure--yes, a thick crop of radishes. My eyes filled\r\nwith tears at the sight of those radishes, and it is probably the only\r\noccasion on record on which radishes have made anybody cry. My dear\r\nfather, whom I so passionately loved, had in his turn passionately\r\nloved this particular border, and spent the spare moments of a busy life\r\nenjoying the flowers that grew in it. He had no time himself for a more\r\nnear acquaintance with the delights of gardening than directing what\r\nplants were to be used, but found rest from his daily work strolling up\r\nand down here, or sitting smoking as close to the flowers as possible.\r\n"It is the Purest of Humane pleasures, it is the Greatest Refreshment\r\nto the Spirits of Man," he would quote (for he read other things besides\r\nthe Kreuzzeitung), looking round with satisfaction on reaching this\r\nfragrant haven after a hot day in the fields. Well, the cousins did not\r\nthink so. Less fanciful, and more sensible as they probably would have\r\nsaid, their position plainly was that you cannot eat flowers. Their\r\nspirits required no refreshment, but their bodies needed much, and\r\ntherefore radishes were more precious than wallflowers. Nor was my\r\nyouth wholly destitute of radishes, but they were grown in the decent\r\nobscurity of odd kitchen garden corners and old cucumber frames, and\r\nwould never have been allowed to come among the flowers. And only\r\nbecause I was not a boy here they were profaning the ground that used\r\nto be so beautiful. Oh, it was a terrible misfortune not to have been a\r\nboy! And how sad and lonely it was, after all, in this ghostly garden.\r\nThe radish bed and what it symbolised had turned my first joy into\r\ngrief. This walk and border me too much of my father reminded, and of\r\nall he had been to me. What I knew of good he had taught me, and what\r\nI had of happiness was through him. Only once during all the years we\r\nlived together had we been of different opinions and fallen out, and\r\nit was the one time I ever saw him severe. I was four years old, and\r\ndemanded one Sunday to be taken to church. My father said no, for I had\r\nnever been to church, and the German service is long and exhausting. I\r\nimplored. He again said no. I implored again, and showed such a pious\r\ndisposition, and so earnest a determination to behave well, that he gave\r\nin, and we went off very happily hand in hand. "Now mind, Elizabeth," he\r\nsaid, turning to me at the church door, "there is no coming out again\r\nin the middle. Having insisted on being brought, thou shalt now sit\r\npatiently till the end." "Oh, yes, oh, yes," I promised eagerly,\r\nand went in filled with holy fire. The shortness of my legs, hanging\r\nhelplessly for two hours midway between the seat and the floor, was the\r\nweapon chosen by Satan for my destruction. In German churches you do\r\nnot kneel, and seldom stand, but sit nearly the whole time, praying\r\nand singing in great comfort. If you are four years old, however, this\r\nunchanged position soon becomes one of torture. Unknown and dreadful\r\nthings go on in your legs, strange prickings and tinglings and dartings\r\nup and down, a sudden terrifying numbness, when you think they must have\r\ndropped off but are afraid to look, then renewed and fiercer prickings,\r\nshootings, and burnings. I thought I must be very ill, for I had\r\nnever known my legs like that before. My father sitting beside me was\r\nengrossed in the singing of a chorale that evidently had no end, each\r\nverse finished with a long-drawn-out hallelujah, after which the organ\r\nplayed by itself for a hundred years--by the organist\'s watch, which\r\nwas wrong, two minutes exactly--and then another verse began. My father,\r\nbeing the patron of the living, was careful to sing and pray and listen\r\nto the sermon with exemplary attention, aware that every eye in the\r\nlittle church was on our pew, and at first I tried to imitate him; but\r\nthe behaviour of my legs became so alarming that after vainly casting\r\nimploring glances at him and seeing that he continued his singing\r\nunmoved, I put out my hand and pulled his sleeve.\r\n\r\n"Hal-le-lu-jah," sang my father with deliberation; continuing in a\r\nlow voice without changing the expression of his face, his lips\r\nhardly moving, and his eyes fixed abstractedly on the ceiling till the\r\norganist, who was also the postman, should have finished his solo, "Did\r\nI not tell thee to sit still, Elizabeth?" "Yes, but----" "Then do it."\r\n"But I want to go home."\r\n\r\n"Unsinn." And the next verse beginning, my father sang louder than ever.\r\nWhat could I do? Should I cry? I began to be afraid I was going to die\r\non that chair, so extraordinary were the sensations in my legs. What\r\ncould my father do to me if I did cry? With the quick instinct of small\r\nchildren I felt that he could not put me in the corner in church, nor\r\nwould he whip me in public, and that with the whole village looking\r\non, he was helpless, and would have to give in. Therefore I tugged his\r\nsleeve again and more peremptorily, and prepared to demand my immediate\r\nremoval in a loud voice. But my father was ready for me. Without\r\ninterrupting his singing, or altering his devout expression, he put his\r\nhand slowly down and gave me a hard pinch--not a playful pinch, but a\r\ngood hard unmistakeable pinch, such as I had never imagined possible,\r\nand then went on serenely to the next hallelujah. For a moment I was\r\npetrified with astonishment. Was this my indulgent father, my playmate,\r\nadorer, and friend? Smarting with pain, for I was a round baby, with\r\na nicely stretched, tight skin, and dreadfully hurt in my feelings, I\r\nopened my mouth to shriek in earnest, when my father\'s clear whisper\r\nfell on my ear, each word distinct and not to be misunderstood, his eyes\r\nas before gazing meditatively into space, and his lips hardly moving,\r\n"Elizabeth, wenn du schreist, kneife ich dich bis du platzt." And he\r\nfinished the verse with unruffled decorum--\r\n\r\n    "Will Satan mich verschlingen,\r\n     So lass die Engel singen\r\n                 Hallelujah!"\r\n\r\nWe never had another difference. Up to then he had been my willing\r\nslave, and after that I was his.\r\n\r\nWith a smile and a shiver I turned from the border and its memories to\r\nthe door in the wall leading to the kitchen garden, in a corner of which\r\nmy own little garden used to be. The door was open, and I stood still a\r\nmoment before going through, to hold my breath and listen. The silence\r\nwas as profound as before. The place seemed deserted; and I should\r\nhave thought the house empty and shut up but for the carefully tended\r\nradishes and the recent footmarks on the green of the path. They were\r\nthe footmarks of a child. I was stooping down to examine a specially\r\nclear one, when the loud caw of a very bored looking crow sitting on the\r\nwall just above my head made me jump as I have seldom in my life jumped,\r\nand reminded me that I was trespassing. Clearly my nerves were all to\r\npieces, for I gathered up my skirts and fled through the door as though\r\na whole army of ghosts and cousins were at my heels, nor did I stop till\r\nI had reached the remote corner where my garden was. "Are you enjoying\r\nyourself, Elizabeth?" asked the mocking sprite that calls itself my\r\nsoul: but I was too much out of breath to answer.\r\n\r\nThis was really a very safe corner. It was separated from the main\r\ngarden and the house by the wall, and shut in on the north side by an\r\norchard, and it was to the last degree unlikely that any one would come\r\nthere on such an afternoon. This plot of ground, turned now as I saw\r\ninto a rockery, had been the scene of my most untiring labours. Into the\r\ncold earth of this north border on which the sun never shone I had dug\r\nmy brightest hopes. All my pocket money had been spent on it, and as\r\nbulbs were dear and my weekly allowance small, in a fatal hour I had\r\nborrowed from Fraulein Wundermacher, selling her my independence,\r\npassing utterly into her power, forced as a result till my next birthday\r\nshould come round to an unnatural suavity of speech and manner in her\r\ncompany, against which my very soul revolted. And after all, nothing\r\ncame up. The labour of digging and watering, the anxious zeal with which\r\nI pounced on weeds, the poring over gardening books, the plans made as I\r\nsat on the little seat in the middle gazing admiringly and with the\r\neye of faith on the trim surface so soon to be gemmed with a thousand\r\nflowers, the reckless expenditure of pfennings, the humiliation of my\r\nposition in regard to Fraulein Wundermacher,--all, all had been in vain.\r\nNo sun shone there, and nothing grew. The gardener who reigned supreme\r\nin those days had given me this big piece for that sole reason, because\r\nhe could do nothing with it himself. He was no doubt of opinion that it\r\nwas quite good enough for a child to experiment upon, and went his way,\r\nwhen I had thanked him with a profuseness of gratitude I still remember,\r\nwith an unmoved countenance. For more than a year I worked and waited,\r\nand watched the career of the flourishing orchard opposite with puzzled\r\nfeelings. The orchard was only a few yards away, and yet, although my\r\ngarden was full of manure, and water, and attentions that were never\r\nbestowed on the orchard, all it could show and ever did show were a few\r\nunhappy beginnings of growth that either remained stationary and did\r\nnot achieve flowers, or dwindled down again and vanished. Once I timidly\r\nasked the gardener if he could explain these signs and wonders, but he\r\nwas a busy man with no time for answering questions, and told me shortly\r\nthat gardening was not learned in a day. How well I remember that\r\nafternoon, and the very shape of the lazy clouds, and the smell of\r\nspring things, and myself going away abashed and sitting on the shaky\r\nbench in my domain and wondering for the hundredth time what it was that\r\nmade the difference between my bit and the bit of orchard in front of\r\nme. The fruit trees, far enough away from the wall to be beyond the\r\nreach of its cold shade, were tossing their flower-laden heads in the\r\nsunshine in a carelessly well-satisfied fashion that filled my heart\r\nwith envy. There was a rise in the field behind them, and at the foot\r\nof its protecting slope they luxuriated in the insolent glory of their\r\nwhite and pink perfection. It was May, and my heart bled at the thought\r\nof the tulips I had put in in November, and that I had never seen since.\r\nThe whole of the rest of the garden was on fire with tulips; behind\r\nme, on the other side of the wall, were rows and rows of them,--cups of\r\ntranslucent loveliness, a jewelled ring flung right round the lawn. But\r\nwhat was there not on the other side of that wall? Things came up there\r\nand grew and flowered exactly as my gardening books said they should do;\r\nand in front of me, in the gay orchard, things that nobody ever\r\ntroubled about or cultivated or noticed throve joyously beneath the\r\ntrees,--daffodils thrusting their spears through the grass, crocuses\r\npeeping out inquiringly, snowdrops uncovering their small cold faces\r\nwhen the first shivering spring days came. Only my piece that I so loved\r\nwas perpetually ugly and empty. And I sat in it thinking of these things\r\non that radiant day, and wept aloud.\r\n\r\nThen an apprentice came by, a youth who had often seen me busily\r\ndigging, and noticing the unusual tears, and struck perhaps by the\r\ndifference between my garden and the profusion of splendour all around,\r\npaused with his barrow on the path in front of me, and remarked\r\nthat nobody could expect to get blood out of a stone. The apparent\r\nirrelevance of this statement made me weep still louder, the bitter\r\ntears of insulted sorrow; but he stuck to his point, and harangued me\r\nfrom the path, explaining the connection between north walls and tulips\r\nand blood and stones till my tears all dried up again and I listened\r\nattentively, for the conclusion to be drawn from his remarks was plainly\r\nthat I had been shamefully taken in by the head gardener, who was an\r\nunprincipled person thenceforward to be for ever mistrusted and shunned.\r\nStanding on the path from which the kindly apprentice had expounded his\r\nproverb, this scene rose before me as clearly as though it had taken\r\nplace that very day; but how different everything looked, and how it had\r\nshrunk! Was this the wide orchard that had seemed to stretch away,\r\nit and the sloping field beyond, up to the gates of heaven? I believe\r\nnearly every child who is much alone goes through a certain time of\r\nhourly expecting the Day of Judgment, and I had made up my mind that\r\non that Day the heavenly host would enter the world by that very field,\r\ncoming down the slope in shining ranks, treading the daffodils under\r\nfoot, filling the orchard with their songs of exultation, joyously\r\nseeking out the sheep from among the goats. Of course I was a sheep, and\r\nmy governess and the head gardener goats, so that the results could not\r\nfail to be in every way satisfactory. But looking up at the slope and\r\nremembering my visions, I laughed at the smallness of the field I had\r\nsupposed would hold all heaven.\r\n\r\nHere again the cousins had been at work. The site of my garden was\r\noccupied by a rockery, and the orchard grass with all its treasures\r\nhad been dug up, and the spaces between the trees planted with currant\r\nbushes and celery in admirable rows; so that no future little cousins\r\nwill be able to dream of celestial hosts coming towards them across the\r\nfields of daffodils, and will perhaps be the better for being free from\r\nvisions of the kind, for as I grew older, uncomfortable doubts laid\r\nhold of my heart with cold fingers, dim uncertainties as to the\r\nexact ultimate position of the gardener and the governess, anxious\r\nquestionings as to how it would be if it were they who turned out after\r\nall to be sheep, and I who--? For that we all three might be gathered\r\ninto the same fold at the last never, in those days, struck me as\r\npossible, and if it had I should not have liked it.\r\n\r\n"Now what sort of person can that be," I asked myself, shaking my head,\r\nas I contemplated the changes before me, "who could put a rockery among\r\nvegetables and currant bushes? A rockery, of all things in the gardening\r\nworld, needs consummate tact in its treatment. It is easier to make\r\nmistakes in forming a rockery than in any other garden scheme. Either it\r\nis a great success, or it is great failure; either it is very charming,\r\nor it is very absurd. There is no state between the sublime and\r\nthe ridiculous possible in a rockery." I stood shaking my head\r\ndisapprovingly at the rockery before me, lost in these reflections, when\r\na sudden quick pattering of feet coming along in a great hurry made me\r\nturn round with a start, just in time to receive the shock of a body\r\ntumbling out of the mist and knocking violently against me.\r\n\r\nIt was a little girl of about twelve years old.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" said the little girl in excellent English; and then we stared\r\nat each other in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were Miss Robinson," said the little girl, offering no\r\napology for having nearly knocked me down. "Who are you?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Robinson? Miss Robinson?" I repeated, my eyes fixed on the little\r\ngirl\'s face, and a host of memories stirring within me. "Why, didn\'t she\r\nmarry a missionary, and go out to some place where they ate him?"\r\n\r\nThe little girl stared harder. "Ate him? Marry? What, has she been\r\nmarried all this time to somebody who\'s been eaten and never let on? Oh,\r\nI say, what a game!" And she threw back her head and laughed till the\r\ngarden rang again.\r\n\r\n"O hush, you dreadful little girl!" I implored, catching her by the arm,\r\nand terrified beyond measure by the loudness of her mirth. "Don\'t make\r\nthat horrid noise--we are certain to be caught if you don\'t stop----"\r\n\r\nThe little girl broke off a shriek of laughter in the middle and shut\r\nher mouth with a snap. Her eyes, round and black and shiny like boot\r\nbuttons, came still further out of her head. "Caught?" she said eagerly.\r\n"What, are you afraid of being caught too? Well, this is a game!" And\r\nwith her hands plunged deep in the pockets of her coat she capered in\r\nfront of me in the excess of her enjoyment, reminding me of a very fat\r\nblack lamb frisking round the dazed and passive sheep its mother.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the time had come for me to get down to the gate at\r\nthe end of the garden as quickly as possible, and I began to move away\r\nin that direction. The little girl at once stopped capering and planted\r\nherself squarely in front of me. "Who are you?" she said, examining me\r\nfrom my hat to my boots with the keenest interest.\r\n\r\nI considered this ungarnished manner of asking questions impertinent,\r\nand, trying to look lofty, made an attempt to pass at the side.\r\n\r\nThe little girl, with a quick, cork-like movement, was there before me.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" she repeated, her expression friendly but firm. "Oh,\r\nI--I\'m a pilgrim," I said in desperation.\r\n\r\n"A pilgrim!" echoed the little girl. She seemed struck, and while she\r\nwas struck I slipped past her and began to walk quickly towards the door\r\nin the wall. "A pilgrim!" said the little girl, again, keeping close\r\nbeside me, and looking me up and down attentively. "I don\'t like\r\npilgrims. Aren\'t they people who are always walking about, and have\r\nthings the matter with their feet? Have you got anything the matter with\r\nyour feet?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," I replied indignantly, walking still faster. "And they\r\nnever wash, Miss Robinson says. You don\'t either, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Not wash? Oh, I\'m afraid you are a very badly brought-up little\r\ngirl--oh, leave me alone--I must run--"\r\n\r\n"So must I," said the little girl, cheerfully, "for Miss Robinson must\r\nbe close behind us. She nearly had me just before I found you." And she\r\nstarted running by my side.\r\n\r\nThe thought of Miss Robinson close behind us gave wings to my feet, and,\r\ncasting my dignity, of which, indeed, there was but little left, to\r\nthe winds, I fairly flew down the path. The little girl was not to be\r\noutrun, and though she panted and turned weird colours, kept by my side\r\nand even talked. Oh, I was tired, tired in body and mind, tired by the\r\ndifferent shocks I had received, tired by the journey, tired by the want\r\nof food; and here I was being forced to run because this very naughty\r\nlittle girl chose to hide instead of going in to her lessons.\r\n\r\n"I say--this is jolly--" she jerked out.\r\n\r\n"But why need we run to the same place?" I breathlessly asked, in the\r\nvain hope of getting rid of her. "Oh, yes--that\'s just--the fun. We\'d\r\nget on--together--you and I--"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said I, decided on this point, bewildered though I was.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t stand washing--either--it\'s awful--in winter--and makes one\r\nhave--chaps."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t mind it in the least," I protested faintly, not having any\r\nenergy left.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say!" said the little girl, looking at my face, and making the\r\nsound known as a guffaw. The familiarity of this little girl was wholly\r\nrevolting.\r\n\r\nWe had got safely through the door, round the corner past the radishes,\r\nand were in the shrubbery. I knew from experience how easy it was to\r\nhide in the tangle of little paths, and stopped a moment to look round\r\nand listen. The little girl opened her mouth to speak. With great\r\npresence of mind I instantly put my muff in front of it and held it\r\nthere tight, while I listened. Dead silence, except for the laboured\r\nbreathing and struggles of the little girl.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t hear a sound," I whispered, letting her go again. "Now what did\r\nyou want to say?" I added, eyeing her severely.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to say," she panted, "that it\'s no good pretending you wash\r\nwith a nose like that."\r\n\r\n"A nose like that! A nose like what?" I exclaimed, greatly offended; and\r\nthough I put up my hand and very tenderly and carefully felt it, I could\r\nfind no difference in it. "I am afraid poor Miss Robinson must have a\r\nwretched life," I said, in tones of deep disgust.\r\n\r\nThe little girl smiled fatuously, as though I were paying her\r\ncompliments. "It\'s all green and brown," she said, pointing. "Is it\r\nalways like that?"\r\n\r\nThen I remembered the wet fir tree near the gate, and the enraptured\r\nkiss it had received, and blushed.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t it come off?" persisted the little girl.\r\n\r\n"Of course it will come off," I answered, frowning.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you rub it off?"\r\n\r\nThen I remembered the throwing away of the handkerchief, and blushed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Please lend me your handkerchief," I said humbly, "I--I have lost\r\nmine."\r\n\r\nThere was a great fumbling in six different pockets, and then a\r\nhandkerchief that made me young again merely to look at it was produced.\r\nI took it thankfully and rubbed with energy, the little girl, intensely\r\ninterested, watching the operation and giving me advice. "There--it\'s\r\nall right now--a little more on the right--there--now it\'s all off."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure? No green left?" I anxiously asked.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s red all over now," she replied cheerfully. "Let me get home,"\r\nthought I, very much upset by this information, "let me get home to my\r\ndear, uncritical, admiring babies, who accept my nose as an example of\r\nwhat a nose should be, and whatever its colour think it beautiful." And\r\nthrusting the handkerchief back into the little girl\'s hands, I hurried\r\naway down the path. She packed it away hastily, but it took some seconds\r\nfor it was of the size of a small sheet, and then came running after me.\r\n"Where are you going?" she asked surprised, as I turned down the path\r\nleading to the gate.\r\n\r\n"Through this gate," I replied with decision.\r\n\r\n"But you mustn\'t--we\'re not allowed to go through there----"\r\n\r\nSo strong was the force of old habits in that place that at the words\r\nnot allowed my hand dropped of itself from the latch; and at that\r\ninstant a voice calling quite close to us through the mist struck me\r\nrigid.\r\n\r\n"Elizabeth! Elizabeth!" called the voice, "Come in at once to your\r\nlessons--Elizabeth! Elizabeth!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s Miss Robinson," whispered the little girl, twinkling with\r\nexcitement; then, catching sight of my face, she said once more with\r\neager insistence, "Who are you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m a ghost!" I cried with conviction, pressing my hands to my\r\nforehead and looking round fearfully.\r\n\r\n"Pooh," said the little girl.\r\n\r\nIt was the last remark I heard her make, for there was a creaking of\r\napproaching boots in the bushes, and seized by a frightful panic I\r\npulled the gate open with one desperate pull, flung it to behind me, and\r\nfled out and away down the wide, misty fields.\r\n\r\nThe Gotha Almanach says that the reigning cousin married the daughter\r\nof a Mr. Johnstone, an Englishman, in 1885, and that in 1886 their only\r\nchild was born, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 20th.--Last night we had ten degrees of frost (Fahrenheit), and\r\nI went out the first thing this morning to see what had become of the\r\ntea-roses, and behold, they were wide awake and quite cheerful--covered\r\nwith rime it is true, but anything but black and shrivelled. Even those\r\nin boxes on each side of the verandah steps were perfectly alive and\r\nfull of buds, and one in particular, a Bouquet d\'Or, is a mass of buds,\r\nand would flower if it could get the least encouragement. I am beginning\r\nto think that the tenderness of tea-roses is much exaggerated, and am\r\ncertainly very glad I had the courage to try them in this northern\r\ngarden. But I must not fly too boldly in the face of Providence, and\r\nhave ordered those in the boxes to be taken into the greenhouse for the\r\nwinter, and hope the Bouquet d\'Or, in a sunny place near the glass, may\r\nbe induced to open some of those buds. The greenhouse is only used as a\r\nrefuge, and kept at a temperature just above freezing, and is reserved\r\nentirely for such plants as cannot stand the very coldest part of the\r\nwinter out of doors. I don\'t use it for growing anything, because I\r\ndon\'t love things that will only bear the garden for three or four\r\nmonths in the year and require coaxing and petting for the rest of it.\r\nGive me a garden full of strong, healthy creatures, able to stand\r\nroughness and cold without dismally giving in and dying. I never could\r\nsee that delicacy of constitution is pretty, either in plants or women.\r\nNo doubt there are many lovely flowers to be had by heat and constant\r\ncoaxing, but then for each of these there are fifty others still\r\nlovelier that will gratefully grow in God\'s wholesome air and are\r\nblessed in return with a far greater intensity of scent and colour.\r\n\r\nWe have been very busy till now getting the permanent beds into order\r\nand planting the new tea-roses, and I am looking forward to next summer\r\nwith more hope than ever in spite of my many failures. I wish the years\r\nwould pass quickly that will bring my garden to perfection! The Persian\r\nYellows have gone into their new quarters, and their place is occupied\r\nby the tearose Safrano; all the rose beds are carpeted with pansies sown\r\nin July and transplanted in October, each bed having a separate colour.\r\nThe purple ones are the most charming and go well with every rose, but I\r\nhave white ones with Laurette Messimy, and yellow ones with Safrano, and\r\na new red sort in the big centre bed of red roses. Round the semicircle\r\non the south side of the little privet hedge two rows of annual\r\nlarkspurs in all their delicate shades have been sown, and just beyond\r\nthe larkspurs, on the grass, is a semicircle of standard tea and pillar\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nIn front of the house the long borders have been stocked with larkspurs,\r\nannual and perennial, columbines, giant poppies, pinks, Madonna\r\nlilies, wallflowers, hollyhocks, perennial phloxes, peonies, lavender,\r\nstarworts, cornflowers, Lychnis chalcedonica, and bulbs packed in\r\nwherever bulbs could go. These are the borders that were so hardly used\r\nby the other gardener. The spring boxes for the verandah steps have been\r\nfilled with pink and white and yellow tulips. I love tulips better than\r\nany other spring flower; they are the embodiment of alert cheerfulness\r\nand tidy grace, and next to a hyacinth look like a wholesome, freshly\r\ntubbed young girl beside a stout lady whose every movement weighs\r\ndown the air with patchouli. Their faint, delicate scent is refinement\r\nitself; and is there anything in the world more charming than the\r\nsprightly way they hold up their little faces to the sun. I have heard\r\nthem called bold and flaunting, but to me they seem modest grace itself,\r\nonly always on the alert to enjoy life as much as they can and not\r\nafraid of looking the sun or anything else above them in the face. On\r\nthe grass there are two beds of them carpeted with forget-me-nots; and\r\nin the grass, in scattered groups, are daffodils and narcissus. Down\r\nthe wilder shrubbery walks foxgloves and mulleins will (I hope) shine\r\nmajestic; and one cool corner, backed by a group of firs, is graced by\r\nMadonna lilies, white foxgloves, and columbines.\r\n\r\nIn a distant glade I have made a spring garden round an oak tree that\r\nstands alone in the sun--groups of crocuses, daffodils, narcissus,\r\nhyacinths, and tulips, among such flowering shrubs and trees as Pirus\r\nMalus spectabilis, floribunda, and coronaria; Prunus Juliana, Mahaleb,\r\nserotina, triloba, and Pissardi; Cydonias and Weigelias in every colour,\r\nand several kinds of Crataegus and other May lovelinesses. If the\r\nweather behaves itself nicely, and we get gentle rains in due season, I\r\nthink this little corner will be beautiful--but what a big "if" it is!\r\nDrought is our great enemy, and the two last summers each contained five\r\nweeks of blazing, cloudless heat when all the ditches dried up and the\r\nsoil was like hot pastry. At such times the watering is naturally quite\r\nbeyond the strength of two men; but as a garden is a place to be happy\r\nin, and not one where you want to meet a dozen curious eyes at every\r\nturn, I should not like to have more than these two, or rather one and a\r\nhalf--the assistant having stork-like proclivities and going home in the\r\nautumn to his native Russia, returning in the spring with the first warm\r\nwinds. I want to keep him over the winter, as there is much to be done\r\neven then, and I sounded him on the point the other day. He is the\r\nmost abject-looking of human beings--lame, and afflicted with a hideous\r\neye-disease; but he is a good worker and plods along unwearyingly from\r\nsunrise to dusk.\r\n\r\n"Pray, my good stork," said I, or German words to that effect, "why\r\ndon\'t you stay here altogether, instead of going home and rioting away\r\nall you have earned?"\r\n\r\n"I would stay," he answered, "but I have my wife there in Russia."\r\n\r\n"Your wife!" I exclaimed, stupidly surprised that the poor deformed\r\ncreature should have found a mate--as though there were not a\r\nsuperfluity of mates in the world--"I didn\'t know you were married?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I have two little children, and I don\'t know what they would\r\ndo if I were not to come home. But it is a very expensive journey to\r\nRussia, and costs me every time seven marks."\r\n\r\n"Seven marks!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is a great sum."\r\n\r\nI wondered whether I should be able to get to Russia for seven marks,\r\nsupposing I were to be seized with an unnatural craving to go there.\r\n\r\nAll the labourers who work here from March to December are Russians\r\nand Poles, or a mixture of both. We send a man over who can speak their\r\nlanguage, to fetch as many as he can early in the year, and they arrive\r\nwith their bundles, men and women and babies, and as soon as they have\r\ngot here and had their fares paid, they disappear in the night if they\r\nget the chance, sometimes fifty of them at a time, to go and work singly\r\nor in couples for the peasants, who pay them a pfenning or two more a\r\nday than we do, and let them eat with the family. From us they get a\r\nmark and a half to two marks a day, and as many potatoes as they can\r\neat. The women get less, not because they work less, but because they\r\nare women and must not be encouraged. The overseer lives with them, and\r\nhas a loaded revolver in his pocket and a savage dog at his heels.\r\nFor the first week or two after their arrival, the foresters and other\r\npermanent officials keep guard at night over the houses they are put\r\ninto. I suppose they find it sleepy work; for certain it is that spring\r\nafter spring the same thing happens, fifty of them getting away in spite\r\nof all our precautions, and we are left with our mouths open and much\r\nout of pocket. This spring, by some mistake, they arrived without their\r\nbundles, which had gone astray on the road, and, as they travel in their\r\nbest clothes, they refused utterly to work until their luggage came.\r\nNearly a week was lost waiting, to the despair of all in authority.\r\n\r\nNor will any persuasions induce them to do anything on Saints\' days, and\r\nthere surely never was a church so full of them as the Russian Church.\r\nIn the spring, when every hour is of vital importance, the work is\r\nconstantly being interrupted by them, and the workers lie sleeping\r\nin the sun the whole day, agreeably conscious that they are pleasing\r\nthemselves and the Church at one and the same time--a state of\r\nperfection as rare as it is desirable. Reason unaided by Faith is of\r\ncourse exasperated at this waste of precious time, and I confess that\r\nduring the first mild days after the long winter frost when it is\r\npossible to begin to work the ground, I have sympathised with the gloom\r\nof the Man of Wrath, confronted in one week by two or three empty days\r\non which no man will labour, and have listened in silence to his remarks\r\nabout distant Russian saints.\r\n\r\nI suppose it was my own superfluous amount of civilisation that made\r\nme pity these people when first I came to live among them. They herd\r\ntogether like animals and do the work of animals; but in spite of the\r\narmed overseer, the dirt and the rags, the meals of potatoes washed down\r\nby weak vinegar and water, I am beginning to believe that they would\r\nstrongly object to soap, I am sure they would not wear new clothes, and\r\nI hear them coming home from their work at dusk singing. They are like\r\nlittle children or animals in their utter inability to grasp the idea\r\nof a future; and after all, if you work all day in God\'s sunshine, when\r\nevening comes you are pleasantly tired and ready for rest and not much\r\ninclined to find fault with your lot. I have not yet persuaded myself,\r\nhowever, that the women are happy. They have to work as hard as the men\r\nand get less for it; they have to produce offspring, quite regardless\r\nof times and seasons and the general fitness of things; they have to do\r\nthis as expeditiously as possible, so that they may not unduly interrupt\r\nthe work in hand; nobody helps them, notices them, or cares about them,\r\nleast of all the husband. It is quite a usual thing to see them working\r\nin the fields in the morning, and working again in the afternoon, having\r\nin the interval produced a baby. The baby is left to an old woman whose\r\nduty it is to look after babies collectively. When I expressed my horror\r\nat the poor creatures working immediately afterwards as though nothing\r\nhad happened, the Man of Wrath informed me that they did not suffer\r\nbecause they had never worn corsets, nor had their mothers and\r\ngrandmothers. We were riding together at the time, and had just passed\r\na batch of workers, and my husband was speaking to the overseer, when\r\na woman arrived alone, and taking up a spade, began to dig. She grinned\r\ncheerfully at us as she made a curtesy, and the overseer remarked that\r\nshe had just been back to the house and had a baby.\r\n\r\n"Poor, poor woman!" I cried, as we rode on, feeling for some occult\r\nreason very angry with the Man of Wrath. "And her wretched husband\r\ndoesn\'t care a rap, and will probably beat her to-night if his supper\r\nisn\'t right. What nonsense it is to talk about the equality of the sexes\r\nwhen the women have the babies!"\r\n\r\n"Quite so, my dear," replied the Man of Wrath, smiling condescendingly.\r\n"You have got to the very root of the matter. Nature, while imposing\r\nthis agreeable duty on the woman, weakens her and disables her for any\r\nserious competition with man. How can a person who is constantly losing\r\na year of the best part of her life compete with a young man who never\r\nloses any time at all? He has the brute force, and his last word on any\r\nsubject could always be his fist."\r\n\r\nI said nothing. It was a dull, gray afternoon in the beginning of\r\nNovember, and the leaves dropped slowly and silently at our horses\' feet\r\nas we rode towards the Hirschwald.\r\n\r\n"It is a universal custom," proceeded the Man of Wrath, "amongst these\r\nRussians, and I believe amongst the lower classes everywhere, and\r\ncertainly commendable on the score of simplicity, to silence a woman\'s\r\nobjections and aspirations by knocking her down. I have heard it said\r\nthat this apparently brutal action has anything but the maddening effect\r\ntenderly nurtured persons might suppose, and that the patient is soothed\r\nand satisfied with a rapidity and completeness unattainable by other and\r\nmore polite methods. Do you suppose," he went on, flicking a twig off\r\na tree with his whip as we passed, "that the intellectual husband,\r\nwrestling intellectually with the chaotic yearnings of his intellectual\r\nwife, ever achieves the result aimed at? He may and does go on wrestling\r\ntill he is tired, but never does he in the very least convince her of\r\nher folly; while his brother in the ragged coat has got through the\r\nwhole business in less time than it takes me to speak about it. There is\r\nno doubt that these poor women fulfil their vocation far more thoroughly\r\nthan the women in our class, and, as the truest: happiness consists in\r\nfinding one\'s vocation quickly and continuing in it all one\'s days, I\r\nconsider they are to be envied rather than not, since they are early\r\ntaught, by the impossibility of argument with marital muscle, the\r\nimpotence of female endeavour and the blessings of content."\r\n\r\n"Pray go on," I said politely.\r\n\r\n"These women accept their beatings with a simplicity worthy of all\r\npraise, and far from considering themselves insulted, admire the\r\nstrength and energy of the man who can administer such eloquent rebukes.\r\nIn Russia, not only may a man beat his wife, but it is laid down in the\r\ncatechism and taught all boys at the time of confirmation as necessary\r\nat least once a week, whether she has done anything or not, for the sake\r\nof her general health and happiness."\r\n\r\nI thought I observed a tendency in the Man of Wrath rather to gloat over\r\nthese castigations.\r\n\r\n"Pray, my dear man," I said, pointing with my whip, "look at that baby\r\nmoon so innocently peeping at us over the edge of the mist just behind\r\nthat silver birch; and don\'t talk so much about women and things you\r\ndon\'t understand. What is the use of your bothering about fists and\r\nwhips and muscles and all the dreadful things invented for the confusion\r\nof obstreperous wives? You know you are a civilised husband, and a\r\ncivilised husband is a creature who has ceased to be a man.\r\n\r\n"And a civilised wife?" he asked, bringing his horse close up beside me\r\nand putting his arm round my waist, "has she ceased to be a woman?"\r\n\r\n"I should think so indeed,--she is a goddess, and can never be\r\nworshipped and adored enough."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," he said, "that the conversation is growing personal."\r\n\r\nI started off at a canter across the short, springy turf. The Hirschwald\r\nis an enchanted place on such an evening, when the mists lie low on the\r\nturf, and overhead the delicate, bare branches of the silver birches\r\nstand out clear against the soft sky, while the little moon looks down\r\nkindly on the damp November world. Where the trees thicken into a wood,\r\nthe fragrance of the wet earth and rotting leaves kicked up by the\r\nhorses\' hoofs fills my soul with delight. I particularly love that\r\nsmell,--it brings before me the entire benevolence of Nature, for ever\r\nworking death and decay, so piteous in themselves, into the means of\r\nfresh life and glory, and sending up sweet odours as she works.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 7th.--I have been to England. I went for at least a month and\r\nstayed a week in a fog and was blown home again in a gale. Twice I fled\r\nbefore the fogs into the country to see friends with gardens, but it\r\nwas raining, and except the beautiful lawns (not to be had in the\r\nFatherland) and the infinite possibilities, there was nothing to\r\ninterest the intelligent and garden-loving foreigner, for the good\r\nreason that you cannot be interested in gardens under an umbrella. So I\r\nwent back to the fogs, and after groping about for a few days more began\r\nto long inordinately for Germany. A terrific gale sprang up after I had\r\nstarted, and the journey both by sea and land was full of horrors, the\r\ntrains in Germany being heated to such an extent that it is next to\r\nimpossible to sit still, great gusts of hot air coming up under the\r\ncushions, the cushions themselves being very hot, and the wretched\r\ntraveller still hotter.\r\n\r\nBut when I reached my home and got out of the train into the purest,\r\nbrightest snow-atmosphere, the air so still that the whole world seemed\r\nto be listening, the sky cloudless, the crisp snow sparkling underfoot\r\nand on the trees, and a happy row of three beaming babies awaiting me, I\r\nwas consoled for all my torments, only remembering them enough to wonder\r\nwhy I had gone away at all.\r\n\r\nThe babies each had a kitten in one hand and an elegant bouquet of pine\r\nneedles and grass in the other, and what with the due presentation of\r\nthe bouquets and the struggles of the kittens, the hugging and kissing\r\nwas much interfered with. Kittens, bouquets, and babies were all somehow\r\nsqueezed into the sleigh, and off we went with jingling bells and\r\nshrieks of delight. "Directly you comes home the fun begins," said the\r\nMay baby, sitting very close to me. "How the snow purrs!" cried the\r\nApril baby, as the horses scrunched it up with their feet. The June baby\r\nsat loudly singing "The King of Love my Shepherd is," and swinging her\r\nkitten round by its tail to emphasise the rhythm.\r\n\r\nThe house, half-buried in the snow, looked the very abode of peace, and\r\nI ran through all the rooms, eager to take possession of them again, and\r\nfeeling as though I had been away for ever. When I got to the library I\r\ncame to a standstill,--ah, the dear room, what happy times I have spent\r\nin it rummaging amongst the books, making plans for my garden, building\r\ncastles in the air, writing, dreaming, doing nothing! There was a big\r\npeat fire blazing half up the chimney, and the old housekeeper had put\r\npots of flowers about, and on the writing-table was a great bunch of\r\nviolets scenting the room. "Oh, how good it is to be home again!" I\r\nsighed in my satisfaction. The babies clung about my knees, looking up\r\nat me with eyes full of love. Outside the dazzling snow and sunshine,\r\ninside the bright room and happy faces--I thought of those yellow fogs\r\nand shivered. The library is not used by the Man of Wrath; it is neutral\r\nground where we meet in the evenings for an hour before he disappears\r\ninto his own rooms--a series of very smoky dens in the southeast\r\ncorner of the house. It looks, I am afraid, rather too gay for an ideal\r\nlibrary; and its colouring, white and yellow, is so cheerful as to be\r\nalmost frivolous. There are white bookcases all round the walls, and\r\nthere is a great fireplace, and four windows, facing full south, opening\r\non to my most cherished bit of garden, the bit round the sun-dial; so\r\nthat with so much colour and such a big fire and such floods of sunshine\r\nit has anything but a sober air, in spite of the venerable volumes\r\nfilling the shelves. Indeed, I should never be surprised if they skipped\r\ndown from their places, and, picking up their leaves, began to dance.\r\n\r\nWith this room to live in, I can look forward with perfect equanimity\r\nto being snowed up for any time Providence thinks proper; and to go into\r\nthe garden in its snowed-up state is like going into a bath of purity.\r\nThe first breath on opening the door is so ineffably pure that it makes\r\nme gasp, and I feel a black and sinful object in the midst of all the\r\nspotlessness. Yesterday I sat out of doors near the sun-dial the whole\r\nafternoon, with the thermometer so many degrees below freezing that\r\nit will be weeks finding its way up again; but there was no wind, and\r\nbeautiful sunshine, and I was well wrapped up in furs. I even had tea\r\nbrought out there, to the astonishment of the menials, and sat till long\r\nafter the sun had set, enjoying the frosty air. I had to drink the tea\r\nvery quickly, for it showed a strong inclination to begin to freeze.\r\nAfter the sun had gone down the rooks came home to their nests in\r\nthe garden with a great fuss and fluttering, and many hesitations and\r\nsquabbles before they settled on their respective trees. They flew over\r\nmy head in hundreds with a mighty swish of wings, and when they had\r\narranged themselves comfortably, an intense hush fell upon the garden,\r\nand the house began to look like a Christmas card, with its white roof\r\nagainst the clear, pale green of the western sky, and lamplight shining\r\nin the windows.\r\n\r\nI had been reading a Life of Luther, lent me by our parson, in the\r\nintervals between looking round me and being happy. He came one day with\r\nthe book and begged me to read it, having discovered that my interest\r\nin Luther was not as living as it ought to be; so I took it out with\r\nme into the garden, because the dullest book takes on a certain saving\r\ngrace if read out of doors, just as bread and butter, devoid of charm in\r\nthe drawing-room, is ambrosia eaten under a tree. I read Luther all the\r\nafternoon with pauses for refreshing glances at the garden and the sky,\r\nand much thankfulness in my heart. His struggles with devils amazed\r\nme; and I wondered whether such a day as that, full of grace and the\r\nforgiveness of sins, never struck him as something to make him relent\r\neven towards devils. He apparently never allowed himself just to be\r\nhappy. He was a wonderful man, but I am glad I was not his wife.\r\n\r\nOur parson is an interesting person, and untiring in his efforts to\r\nimprove himself. Both he and his wife study whenever they have a spare\r\nmoment, and there is a tradition that she stirs her puddings with one\r\nhand and holds a Latin grammar in the other, the grammar, of course,\r\ngetting the greater share of her attention. To most German Hausfraus\r\nthe dinners and the puddings are of paramount importance, and they pride\r\nthemselves on keeping those parts of their houses that are seen in a\r\nstate of perpetual and spotless perfection, and this is exceedingly\r\npraiseworthy; but, I would humbly inquire, are there not other things\r\neven more important? And is not plain living and high thinking better\r\nthan the other way about? And all too careful making of dinners and\r\ndusting of furniture takes a terrible amount of precious time, and--and\r\nwith shame I confess that my sympathies are all with the pudding and the\r\ngrammar. It cannot be right to be the slave of one\'s household gods, and\r\nI protest that if my furniture ever annoyed me by wanting to be dusted\r\nwhen I wanted to be doing something else, and there was no one to do the\r\ndusting for me, I would cast it all into the nearest bonfire and sit and\r\nwarm my toes at the flames with great contentment, triumphantly selling\r\nmy dusters to the very next pedlar who was weak enough to buy them.\r\nParsons\' wives have to do the housework and cooking themselves, and are\r\nthus not only cooks and housemaids, but if they have children--and they\r\nalways do have children--they are head and under nurse as well; and\r\nbesides these trifling duties have a good deal to do with their fruit\r\nand vegetable garden, and everything to do with their poultry. This\r\nbeing so, is it not pathetic to find a young woman bravely struggling\r\nto learn languages and keep up with her husband? If I were that husband,\r\nthose puddings would taste sweetest to me that were served with Latin\r\nsauce. They are both severely pious, and are for ever engaged in\r\ndesperate efforts to practise what they preach; than which, as we all\r\nknow, nothing is more difficult. He works in his parish with the most\r\nnoble self-devotion, and never loses courage, although his efforts\r\nhave been several times rewarded by disgusting libels pasted up on the\r\nstreet-corners, thrown under doors, and even fastened to his own garden\r\nwall. The peasant hereabouts is past belief low and animal, and a\r\nsensitive, intellectual parson among them is really a pearl before\r\nswine. For years he has gone on unflinchingly, filled with the most\r\nliving faith and hope and charity, and I sometimes wonder whether they\r\nare any better now in his parish than they were under his predecessor,\r\na man who smoked and drank beer from Monday morning to Saturday night,\r\nnever did a stroke of work, and often kept the scanty congregation\r\nwaiting on Sunday afternoons while he finished his postprandial nap. It\r\nis discouraging enough to make most men give in, and leave the parish to\r\nget to heaven or not as it pleases; but he never seems discouraged, and\r\ngoes on sacrificing the best part of his life to these people when all\r\nhis tastes are literary, and all his inclinations towards the life of\r\nthe student. His convictions drag him out of his little home at all\r\nhours to minister to the sick and exhort the wicked; they give him no\r\nrest, and never let him feel he has done enough; and when he comes\r\nhome weary, after a day\'s wrestling with his parishioners\' souls, he is\r\nconfronted on his doorstep by filthy abuse pasted up on his own front\r\ndoor. He never speaks of these things, but how shall they be hid?\r\nEverybody here knows everything that happens before the day is over, and\r\nwhat we have for dinner is of far greater general interest than the most\r\nastounding political earthquake. They have a pretty, roomy cottage, and\r\na good bit of ground adjoining the churchyard. His predecessor used to\r\nhang out his washing on the tombstones to dry, but then he was a person\r\nentirely lost to all sense of decency, and had finally to be removed,\r\npreaching a farewell sermon of a most vituperative description, and\r\nhurling invective at the Man of Wrath, who sat up in his box drinking\r\nin every word and enjoying himself thoroughly. The Man of Wrath likes\r\nnovelty, and such a sermon had never been heard before. It is spoken of\r\nin the village to this day with bated breath and awful joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 22nd.--Up to now we have had a beautiful winter. Clear skies,\r\nfrost, little wind, and, except for a sharp touch now and then, very few\r\nreally cold days. My windows are gay with hyacinths and lilies of\r\nthe valley; and though, as I have said, I don\'t admire the smell of\r\nhyacinths in the spring when it seems wanting in youth and chastity next\r\nto that of other flowers, I am glad enough now to bury my nose in\r\ntheir heavy sweetness. In December one cannot afford to be fastidious;\r\nbesides, one is actually less fastidious about everything in the winter.\r\nThe keen air braces soul as well as body into robustness, and the food\r\nand the perfume disliked in the summer are perfectly welcome then.\r\n\r\nI am very busy preparing for Christmas, but have often locked myself up\r\nin a room alone, shutting out my unfinished duties, to study the flower\r\ncatalogues and make my lists of seeds and shrubs and trees for the\r\nspring. It is a fascinating occupation, and acquires an additional charm\r\nwhen you know you ought to be doing something else, that Christmas is\r\nat the door, that children and servants and farm hands depend on you\r\nfor their pleasure, and that, if you don\'t see to the decoration of the\r\ntrees and house, and the buying of the presents, nobody else will. The\r\nhours fly by shut up with those catalogues and with Duty snarling on\r\nthe other side of the door. I don\'t like Duty--everything in the least\r\ndisagreeable is always sure to be one\'s duty. Why cannot it be my duty\r\nto make lists and plans for the dear garden? "And so it is," I insisted\r\nto the Man of Wrath, when he protested against what he called wasting my\r\ntime upstairs. "No," he replied sagely; "your garden is not your duty,\r\nbecause it is your Pleasure."\r\n\r\nWhat a comfort it is to have such wells of wisdom constantly at my\r\ndisposal! Anybody can have a husband, but to few is it given to have a\r\nsage, and the combination of both is as rare as it is useful. Indeed, in\r\nits practical utility the only thing I ever saw to equal it is a sofa my\r\nneighbour has bought as a Christmas surprise for her husband, and which\r\nshe showed me the last time I called there--a beautiful invention, as\r\nshe explained, combining a bedstead, a sofa, and a chest of drawers, and\r\ninto which you put your clothes, and on top of which you put yourself,\r\nand if anybody calls in the middle of the night and you happen to be\r\nusing the drawing-room as a bedroom, you just pop the bedclothes inside,\r\nand there you are discovered sitting on your sofa and looking for all\r\nthe world as though you had been expecting visitors for hours.\r\n\r\n"Pray, does he wear pyjamas?" I inquired.\r\n\r\nBut she had never heard of pyjamas.\r\n\r\nIt takes a long time to make my spring lists. I want to have a border\r\nall yellow, every shade of yellow from fieriest orange to nearly white,\r\nand the amount of work and studying of gardening books it costs me will\r\nonly be appreciated by beginners like myself. I have been weeks planning\r\nit, and it is not nearly finished. I want it to be a succession of\r\nglories from May till the frosts, and the chief feature is to be the\r\nnumber of "ardent marigolds"--flowers that I very tenderly love--and\r\nnasturtiums. The nasturtiums are to be of every sort and shade, and are\r\nto climb and creep and grow in bushes, and show their lovely flowers\r\nand leaves to the best advantage. Then there are to be eschscholtzias,\r\ndahlias, sunflowers, zinnias, scabiosa, portulaca, yellow violas, yellow\r\nstocks, yellow sweet-peas, yellow lupins--everything that is yellow or\r\nthat has a yellow variety. The place I have chosen for it is a long,\r\nwide border in the sun, at the foot of a grassy slope crowned with\r\nlilacs and pines, and facing southeast. You go through a little pine\r\nwood, and, turning a corner, are to come suddenly upon this bit of\r\ncaptured morning glory. I want it to be blinding in its brightness after\r\nthe dark, cool path through the wood.\r\n\r\nThat is the idea. Depression seizes me when I reflect upon the probable\r\ndifference between the idea and its realisation. I am ignorant, and\r\nthe gardener is, I do believe, still more so; for he was forcing some\r\ntulips, and they have all shrivelled up and died, and he says he cannot\r\nimagine why. Besides, he is in love with the cook, and is going to marry\r\nher after Christmas, and refuses to enter into any of my plans with the\r\nenthusiasm they deserve, but sits with vacant eye dreamily chopping\r\nwood from morning till night to keep the beloved one\'s kitchen fire well\r\nsupplied. I cannot understand any one preferring cooks to marigolds;\r\nthose future marigolds, shadowy as they are, and whose seeds are still\r\nsleeping at the seedsman\'s, have shone through my winter days like\r\ngolden lamps.\r\n\r\nI wish with all my heart I were a man, for of course the first thing I\r\nshould do would be to buy a spade and go and garden, and then I should\r\nhave the delight of doing everything for my flowers with my own hands\r\nand need not waste time explaining what I want done to somebody else. It\r\nis dull work giving orders and trying to describe the bright visions of\r\none\'s brain to a person who has no visions and no brain, and who thinks\r\na yellow bed should be calceolarias edged with blue.\r\n\r\nI have taken care in choosing my yellow plants to put down only those\r\nhumble ones that are easily pleased and grateful for little, for my soil\r\nis by no means all that it might be, and to most plants the climate is\r\nrather trying. I feel really grateful to any flower that is sturdy and\r\nwilling enough to flourish here. Pansies seem to like the place and\r\nso do sweet-peas; pinks don\'t, and after much coaxing gave hardly any\r\nflowers last summer. Nearly all the roses were a success, in spite of\r\nthe sandy soil, except the tea-rose Adam, which was covered with buds\r\nready to open, when they suddenly turned brown and died, and three\r\nstandard Dr. Grills which stood in a row and simply sulked. I had been\r\nvery excited about Dr. Grill, his description in the catalogues being\r\nspecially fascinating, and no doubt I deserved the snubbing I got.\r\n"Never be excited, my dears, about anything," shall be the advice I will\r\ngive the three babies when the time comes to take them out to parties,\r\n"or, if you are, don\'t show it. If by nature you are volcanoes, at least\r\nbe only smouldering ones. Don\'t look pleased, don\'t look interested,\r\ndon\'t, above all things, look eager. Calm indifference should be written\r\non every feature of your faces. Never show that you like any one person,\r\nor any one thing. Be cool, languid, and reserved. If you don\'t do as\r\nyour mother tells you and are just gushing, frisky, young idiots, snubs\r\nwill be your portion. If you do as she tells you, you\'ll marry princes\r\nand live happily ever after."\r\n\r\nDr. Grill must be a German rose. In this part of the world the more you\r\nare pleased to see a person the less is he pleased to see you; whereas,\r\nif you are disagreeable, he will grow pleasant visibly, his countenance\r\nexpanding into wider amiability the more your own is stiff and sour. But\r\nI was not Prepared for that sort of thing in a rose, and was disgusted\r\nwith Dr. Grill. He had the best place in the garden--warm, sunny, and\r\nsheltered; his holes were prepared with the tenderest care; he was given\r\nthe most dainty mixture of compost, clay, and manure; he was watered\r\nassiduously all through the drought when more willing flowers got\r\nnothing; and he refused to do anything but look black and shrivel. He\r\ndid not die, but neither did he live--he just existed; and at the end\r\nof the summer not one of him had a scrap more shoot or leaf than when\r\nhe was first put in in April. It would have been better if he had died\r\nstraight away, for then I should have known what to do; as it is, there\r\nhe is still occupying the best place, wrapped up carefully for the\r\nwinter, excluding kinder roses, and probably intending to repeat the\r\nsame conduct next year. Well, trials are the portion of mankind, and\r\ngardeners have their share, and in any case it is better to be tried by\r\nplants than persons, seeing that with plants you know that it is you who\r\nare in the wrong, and with persons it is always the other way about--and\r\nwho is there among us who has not felt the pangs of injured innocence,\r\nand known them to be grievous?\r\n\r\nI have two visitors staying with me, though I have done nothing to\r\nprovoke such an infliction, and had been looking forward to a happy\r\nlittle Christmas alone with the Man of Wrath and the babies. Fate\r\ndecreed otherwise. Quite regularly, if I look forward to anything, Fate\r\nsteps in and decrees otherwise; I don\'t know why it should, but it does.\r\nI had not even invited these good ladies--like greatness on the modest,\r\nthey were thrust upon me. One is Irais, the sweet singer of the summer,\r\nwhom I love as she deserves, but of whom I certainly thought I had seen\r\nthe last for at least a year, when she wrote and asked if I would have\r\nher over Christmas, as her husband was out of sorts, and she didn\'t\r\nlike him in that state. Neither do I like sick husbands, so, full\r\nof sympathy, I begged her to come, and here she is. And the other is\r\nMinora.\r\n\r\nWhy I have to have Minora I don\'t know, for I was not even aware of her\r\nexistence a fortnight ago. Then coming down cheerfully one morning to\r\nbreakfast--it was the very day after my return from England--I found\r\na letter from an English friend, who up till then had been perfectly\r\ninnocuous, asking me to befriend Minora. I read the letter aloud for the\r\nbenefit of the Man of Wrath, who was eating Spickgans, a delicacy much\r\nsought after in these parts. "Do, my dear Elizabeth," wrote my friend,\r\n"take some notice of the poor thing. She is studying art in Dresden,\r\nand has nowhere literally to go for Christmas. She is very ambitious and\r\nhardworking--"\r\n\r\n"Then," interrupted the Man of Wrath, "she is not pretty. Only ugly\r\ngirls work hard."\r\n\r\n"--and she is really very clever--"\r\n\r\n"I do not like clever girls, they are so stupid," again interrupted the\r\nMan of Wrath.\r\n\r\n"--and unless some kind creature like yourself takes pity on her she\r\nwill be very lonely."\r\n\r\n"Then let her be lonely."\r\n\r\n"Her mother is my oldest friend, and would be greatly distressed to\r\nthink that her daughter should be alone in a foreign town at such a\r\nseason."\r\n\r\n"I do not mind the distress of the mother."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear me," I exclaimed impatiently, "I shall have to ask her to\r\ncome!"\r\n\r\n"If you should be inclined," the letter went on, "to play the good\r\nSamaritan, dear Elizabeth, I am positive you would find Minora a bright,\r\nintelligent companion--"\r\n\r\n"Minora?" questioned the Man of Wrath.\r\n\r\nThe April baby, who has had a nursery governess of an altogether\r\nalarmingly zealous type attached to her person for the last six weeks,\r\nlooked up from her bread and milk.\r\n\r\n"It sounds like islands," she remarked pensively.\r\n\r\nThe governess coughed.\r\n\r\n"Majora, Minora, Alderney, and Sark," explained her pupil.\r\n\r\nI looked at her severely.\r\n\r\n"If you are not careful, April," I said, "you\'ll be a genius when you\r\ngrow up and disgrace your parents."\r\n\r\nMiss Jones looked as though she did not like Germans. I am afraid she\r\ndespises us because she thinks we are foreigners--an attitude of mind\r\nquite British and wholly to her credit; but we, on the other hand,\r\nregard her as a foreigner, which, of course, makes things complicated.\r\n\r\n"Shall I really have to have this strange girl?" I asked, addressing\r\nnobody in particular and not expecting a reply.\r\n\r\n"You need not have her," said the Man of Wrath composedly, "but you\r\nwill. You will write to-day and cordially invite her, and when she has\r\nbeen here twenty-four hours you will quarrel with her. I know you, my\r\ndear."\r\n\r\n"Quarrel! I? With a little art-student?" Miss Jones cast down her eyes.\r\nShe is perpetually scenting a scene, and is always ready to bring whole\r\nbatteries of discretion and tact and good taste to bear on us, and seems\r\nto know we are disputing in an unseemly manner when we would never dream\r\nit ourselves but for the warning of her downcast eyes. I would take my\r\ncourage in both hands and ask her to go, for besides this superfluity of\r\ndiscreet behaviour she is, although only nursery, much too zealous, and\r\ninclined to be always teaching and never playing; but, unfortunately,\r\nthe April baby adores her and is sure there never was any one so\r\nbeautiful before. She comes every day with fresh accounts of the\r\nsplendours of her wardrobe, and feeling descriptions of her umbrellas\r\nand hats; and Miss Jones looks offended and purses up her lips. In\r\ncommon with most governesses, she has a little dark down on her\r\nupper lip, and the April baby appeared one day at dinner with her\r\nown decorated in faithful imitation, having achieved it after much\r\nstruggling, with the aid of a lead pencil and unbounded love. Miss Jones\r\nput her in the corner for impertinence. I wonder why governesses are so\r\nunpleasant. The Man of Wrath says it is because they are not married.\r\nWithout venturing to differ entirely from the opinion of experience, I\r\nwould add that the strain of continually having to set an example must\r\nsurely be very great. It is much easier, and often more pleasant, to be\r\na warning than an example, and governesses are but women, and women are\r\nsometimes foolish, and when you want to be foolish it must be annoying\r\nto have to be wise.\r\n\r\nMinora and Irais arrived yesterday together; or rather, when the\r\ncarriage drove up, Irais got out of it alone, and informed me that there\r\nwas a strange girl on a bicycle a little way behind. I sent back the\r\ncarriage to pick her up, for it was dusk and the roads are terrible.\r\n\r\n"But why do you have strange girls here at all?" asked Irais rather\r\npeevishly, taking off her hat in the library before the fire, and\r\notherwise making herself very much at home; "I don\'t like them. I\'m not\r\nsure that they\'re not worse than husbands who are out of order. Who is\r\nshe? She would bicycle from the station, and is, I am sure, the first\r\nwoman who has done it. The little boys threw stones at her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, that only shows the ignorance of the little boys. Never\r\nmind her. Let us have tea in peace before she comes." "But we should be\r\nmuch happier without her," she grumbled. "Weren\'t we happy enough in the\r\nsummer, Elizabeth--just you and I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed we were," I answered heartily, putting my arms round her.\r\nThe flame of my affection for Irais burns very brightly on the day of\r\nher arrival; besides, this time I have prudently provided against her\r\nsinning with the salt-cellars by ordering them to be handed round like\r\nvegetable dishes. We had finished tea and she had gone up to her room to\r\ndress before Minora and her bicycle were got here. I hurried out to meet\r\nher, feeling sorry for her, plunged into a circle of strangers at such a\r\nvery personal season as Christmas. But she was not very shy; indeed, she\r\nwas less shy than I was, and lingered in the hall, giving the servants\r\ndirections to wipe the snow off the tyres of her machine before she lent\r\nan attentive ear to my welcoming remarks.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t make your man understand me at the station," she said at\r\nlast, when her mind was at rest about her bicycle; "I asked him how far\r\nit was, and what the roads were like, and he only smiled. Is he German?\r\nBut of course he is--how odd that he didn\'t understand. You speak\r\nEnglish very well,--very well indeed, do you know." By this time we were\r\nin the library, and she stood on the hearth-rug warming her back while I\r\npoured her out some tea.\r\n\r\n"What a quaint room," she remarked, looking round, "and the hall is so\r\ncurious too. Very old, isn\'t it? There\'s a lot of copy here."\r\n\r\nThe Man of Wrath, who had been in the hall on her arrival and had come\r\nin with us, began to look about on the carpet. "Copy" he inquired,\r\n"Where\'s copy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh--material, you know, for a book. I\'m just jotting down what strikes\r\nme in your country, and when I have time shall throw it into book form."\r\nShe spoke very loud, as English people always do to foreigners.\r\n\r\n"My dear," I said breathlessly to Irais, when I had got into her room\r\nand shut the door and Minora was safely in hers, "what do you think--she\r\nwrites books!"\r\n\r\n"What--the bicycling girl?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--Minora--imagine it!"\r\n\r\nWe stood and looked at each other with awestruck faces.\r\n\r\n"How dreadful!" murmured Irais. "I never met a young girl who did that\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"She says this place is full of copy." "Full of what?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you make books with."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, this is worse than I expected! A strange girl is always\r\na bore among good friends, but one can generally manage her. But a girl\r\nwho writes books--why, it isn\'t respectable! And you can\'t snub that\r\nsort of people; they\'re unsnubbable."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but we\'ll try!" I cried, with such heartiness that we both laughed.\r\n\r\nThe hall and the library struck Minora most; indeed, she lingered so\r\nlong after dinner in the hall, which is cold, that the Man of Wrath put\r\non his fur coat by way of a gentle hint. His hints are always gentle.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to hear the whole story about the chapel and the nuns and\r\nGustavus Adolphus, and pulling out a fat note-book began to take down\r\nwhat I said. I at once relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\n"Well?" she said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you\'ve only just begun."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t go any further. Won\'t you come into the library?"\r\n\r\nIn the library she again took up her stand before the fire and warmed\r\nherself, and we sat in a row and were cold. She has a wonderfully good\r\nprofile, which is irritating. The wind, however, is tempered to the\r\nshorn lamb by her eyes being set too closely together.\r\n\r\nIrais lit a cigarette, and leaning back in her chair, contemplated her\r\ncritically beneath her long eyelashes. "You are writing a book?" she\r\nasked presently.\r\n\r\n"Well--yes, I suppose I may say that I am. Just my impressions, you\r\nknow, of your country. Anything that strikes me as curious or amusing--I\r\njot it down, and when I have time shall work it up into something, I\r\ndaresay."\r\n\r\n"Are you not studying painting?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I can\'t study that for ever. We have an English proverb: \'Life\r\nis short and Art is long\'--too long, I sometimes think--and writing is a\r\ngreat relaxation when I am tired."\r\n\r\n"What shall you call it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thought of calling it Journeyings in Germany. It sounds well, and\r\nwould be correct. Or Jottings from German Journeyings,--I haven\'t quite\r\ndecided yet which."\r\n\r\n"By the author of Prowls in Pomerania, you might add," suggested Irais.\r\n\r\n"And Drivel from Dresden," said I.\r\n\r\n"And Bosh from Berlin," added Irais.\r\n\r\nMinora stared. "I don\'t think those two last ones would do," she said,\r\n"because it is not to be a facetious book. But your first one is\r\nrather a good title," she added, looking at Irais and drawing out her\r\nnote-book. "I think I\'ll just jot that down."\r\n\r\n"If you jot down all we say and then publish it, will it still be your\r\nbook?" asked Irais.\r\n\r\nBut Minora was so busy scribbling that she did not hear.\r\n\r\n"And have you no suggestions to make, Sage?" asked Irais, turning to the\r\nMan of Wrath, who was blowing out clouds of smoke in silence.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do you call him Sage?" cried Minora; "and always in English?"\r\n\r\nIrais and I looked at each other. We knew what we did call him, and were\r\nafraid Minora would in time ferret it out and enter it in her note-book.\r\nThe Man of Wrath looked none too well pleased to be alluded to under his\r\nvery nose by our new guest as "him."\r\n\r\n"Husbands are always sages," said I gravely.\r\n\r\n"Though sages are not always husbands," said Irais with equal gravity.\r\n"Sages and husbands--sage and husbands--" she went on musingly, "what\r\ndoes that remind you of, Miss Minora?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know,--how stupid of me!" cried Minora eagerly, her pencil in\r\nmid-air and her brain clutching at the elusive recollection, "sage\r\nand,--why,--yes,--no,--yes, of course--oh," disappointedly, "but that\'s\r\nvulgar--I can\'t put it in."\r\n\r\n"What is vulgar?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"She thinks sage and onions is vulgar," said Irais languidly; "but\r\nit isn\'t, it is very good." She got up and walked to the piano, and,\r\nsitting down, began, after a little wandering over the keys, to sing.\r\n\r\n"Do you play?" I asked Minora.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I am afraid I am rather out of practice."\r\n\r\nI said no more. I know what that sort of playing is.\r\n\r\nWhen we were lighting our bedroom candles Minora began suddenly to\r\nspeak in an unknown tongue. We stared. "What is the matter with her?"\r\nmurmured Irais.\r\n\r\n"I thought, perhaps," said Minora in English, "you might prefer to talk\r\nGerman, and as it is all the same to me what I talk--" "Oh, pray don\'t\r\ntrouble," said Irais. "We like airing our English--don\'t we, Elizabeth?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want my German to get rusty though," said Minora; "I shouldn\'t\r\nlike to forget it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but isn\'t there an English song," said Irais, twisting round her\r\nneck as she preceded us upstairs, "\'\'Tis folly to remember, \'tis wisdom\r\nto forget\'?"\r\n\r\n"You are not nervous sleeping alone, I hope," I said hastily.\r\n\r\n"What room is she in?" asked Irais.\r\n\r\n"No. 12."\r\n\r\n"Oh!--do you believe in ghosts?"\r\n\r\nMinora turned pale.\r\n\r\n"What nonsense," said I; "we have no ghosts here. Good-night. If you\r\nwant anything, mind you ring."\r\n\r\n"And if you see anything curious in that room," called Irais from her\r\nbedroom door, "mind you jot it down."\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 27th--It is the fashion, I believe, to regard Christmas as a\r\nbore of rather a gross description, and as a time when you are invited\r\nto over-eat yourself, and pretend to be merry without just cause. As a\r\nmatter of fact, it is one of the prettiest and most poetic institutions\r\npossible, if observed in the proper manner, and after having been more\r\nor less unpleasant to everybody for a whole year, it is a blessing to be\r\nforced on that one day to be amiable, and it is certainly delightful to\r\nbe able to give presents without being haunted by the conviction that\r\nyou are spoiling the recipient, and will suffer for it afterward.\r\nServants are only big children, and are made just as happy as children\r\nby little presents and nice things to eat, and, for days beforehand,\r\nevery time the three babies go into the garden they expect to meet the\r\nChrist Child with His arms full of gifts. They firmly believe that it\r\nis thus their presents are brought, and it is such a charming idea that\r\nChristmas would be worth celebrating for its sake alone.\r\n\r\nAs great secrecy is observed, the preparations devolve entirely on me,\r\nand it is not very easy work, with so many people in our own house and\r\non each of the farms, and all the children, big and little, expecting\r\ntheir share of happiness. The library is uninhabitable for several days\r\nbefore and after, as it is there that we have the trees and presents.\r\nAll down one side are the trees, and the other three sides are lined\r\nwith tables, a separate one for each person in the house. When the\r\ntrees are lighted, and stand in their radiance shining down on the happy\r\nfaces, I forget all the trouble it has been, and the number of times I\r\nhave had to run up and down stairs, and the various aches in head\r\nand feet, and enjoy myself as much as anybody. First the June baby is\r\nushered in, then the others and ourselves according to age, then\r\nthe servants, then come the head inspector and his family, the other\r\ninspectors from the different farms, the mamsells, the bookkeepers and\r\nsecretaries, and then all the children, troops and troops of them--the\r\nbig ones leading the little ones by the hand and carrying the babies in\r\ntheir arms, and the mothers peeping round the door. As many as can get\r\nin stand in front of the trees, and sing two or three carols; then they\r\nare given their presents, and go off triumphantly, making room for the\r\nnext batch. My three babies sang lustily too, whether they happened to\r\nknow what was being sung or not. They had on white dresses in honour\r\nof the occasion, and the June baby was even arrayed in a low-necked and\r\nshort-sleeved garment, after the manner of Teutonic infants,\r\nwhatever the state of the thermometer. Her arms are like miniature\r\nprize-fighter\'s arms--I never saw such things; they are the pride and\r\njoy of her little nurse, who had tied them up with blue ribbons, and\r\nkept on kissing them. I shall certainly not be able to take her to balls\r\nwhen she grows up, if she goes on having arms like that.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to say good-night, they were all very pale and subdued.\r\nThe April baby had an exhausted-looking Japanese doll with her, which\r\nshe said she was taking to bed, not because she liked him, but because\r\nshe was so sorry for him, he seemed so very tired. They kissed me\r\nabsently, and went away, only the April baby glancing at the trees as\r\nshe passed and making them a curtesy.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, trees," I heard her say; and then she made the Japanese doll\r\nbow to them, which he did, in a very languid and blase fashion. "You\'ll\r\nnever see such trees again," she told him, giving him a vindictive\r\nshake, "for you\'ll be brokened long before next time."\r\n\r\nShe went out, but came back as though she had forgotten something.\r\n\r\n"Thank the Christkind so much, Mummy, won\'t you, for all the lovely\r\nthings He brought us. I suppose you\'re writing to Him now, isn\'t you?"\r\n\r\nI cannot see that there was anything gross about our Christmas, and we\r\nwere perfectly merry without any need to pretend, and for at least two\r\ndays it brought us a little nearer together, and made us kind. Happiness\r\nis so wholesome; it invigorates and warms me into piety far more\r\neffectually than any amount of trials and griefs, and an unexpected\r\npleasure is the surest means of bringing me to my knees. In spite of the\r\nprotestations of some peculiarly constructed persons that they are the\r\nbetter for trials, I don\'t believe it. Such things must sour us, just as\r\nhappiness must sweeten us, and make us kinder, and more gentle. And will\r\nanybody affirm that it behoves us to be more thankful for trials\r\nthan for blessings? We were meant to be happy, and to accept all the\r\nhappiness offered with thankfulness--indeed, we are none of us ever\r\nthankful enough, and yet we each get so much, so very much, more than\r\nwe deserve. I know a woman--she stayed with me last summer--who rejoices\r\ngrimly when those she loves suffer. She believes that it is our lot,\r\nand that it braces us and does us good, and she would shield no one from\r\neven unnecessary pain; she weeps with the sufferer, but is convinced it\r\nis all for the best. Well, let her continue in her dreary beliefs; she\r\nhas no garden to teach her the beauty and the happiness of holiness, nor\r\ndoes she in the least desire to possess one; her convictions have\r\nthe sad gray colouring of the dingy streets and houses she lives\r\namongst--the sad colour of humanity in masses. Submission to what people\r\ncall their "lot" is simply ignoble. If your lot makes you cry and be\r\nwretched, get rid of it and take another; strike out for yourself;\r\ndon\'t listen to the shrieks of your relations, to their gibes or their\r\nentreaties; don\'t let your own microscopic set prescribe your goings-out\r\nand comings-in; don\'t be afraid of public opinion in the shape of the\r\nneighbour in the next house, when all the world is before you new and\r\nshining, and everything is possible, if you will only be energetic and\r\nindependent and seize opportunity by the scruff of the neck.\r\n\r\n"To hear you talk," said Irais, "no one would ever imagine that you\r\ndream away your days in a garden with a book, and that you never in your\r\nlife seized anything by the scruff of its neck. And what is scruff?\r\nI hope I have not got any on me." And she craned her neck before the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nShe and Minora were going to help me decorate the trees, but very soon\r\nIrais wandered off to the piano, and Minora was tired and took up a\r\nbook; so I called in Miss Jones and the babies--it was Miss Jones\'s last\r\npublic appearance, as I shall relate--and after working for the best\r\npart of two days they were finished, and looked like lovely ladies\r\nin widespreading, sparkling petticoats, holding up their skirts with\r\nglittering fingers. Minora wrote a long description of them for a\r\nchapter of her book which is headed Noel,--I saw that much, because she\r\nleft it open on the table while she went to talk to Miss Jones. They\r\nwere fast friends from the very first, and though it is said to be\r\nnatural to take to one\'s own countrymen, I am unable altogether to\r\nsympathise with such a reason for sudden affection.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what they talk about?" I said to Irais yesterday, when there\r\nwas no getting Minora to come to tea, so deeply was she engaged in\r\nconversation with Miss Jones.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, how can I tell? Lovers, I suppose, or else they think they\r\nare clever, and then they talk rubbish."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course, Minora thinks she is clever."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she does. What does it matter what she thinks? Why does your\r\ngoverness look so gloomy? When I see her at luncheon I always imagine\r\nshe must have just heard that somebody is dead. But she can\'t hear that\r\nevery day. What is the matter with her?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she feels quite as proper as she looks," I said\r\ndoubtfully; I was for ever trying to account for Miss Jones\'s\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n"But that must be rather nice," said Irais. "It would be awful for her\r\nif she felt exactly the same as she looks."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door leading into the schoolroom opened softly,\r\nand the April baby, tired of playing, came in and sat down at my feet,\r\nleaving the door open; and this is what we heard Miss Jones saying--\r\n\r\n"Parents are seldom wise, and the strain the conscientious place upon\r\nthemselves to appear so before their children and governess must be\r\nterrible. Nor are clergymen more pious than other men, yet they have\r\ncontinually to pose before their flock as such. As for governesses, Miss\r\nMinora, I know what I am saying when I affirm that there is nothing more\r\nintolerable than to have to be polite, and even humble, to persons whose\r\nweaknesses and follies are glaringly apparent in every word they utter,\r\nand to be forced by the presence of children and employers to a dignity\r\nof manner in no way corresponding to one\'s feelings. The grave father of\r\na family, who was probably one of the least respectable of bachelors, is\r\nan interesting study at his own table, where he is constrained to assume\r\nairs of infallibility merely because his children are looking at him.\r\nThe fact of his being a parent does not endow him with any supreme and\r\nsudden virtue; and I can assure you that among the eyes fixed upon him,\r\nnot the least critical and amused are those of the humble person who\r\nfills the post of governess."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Jones, how lovely!" we heard Minora say in accents of rapture,\r\nwhile we sat transfixed with horror at these sentiments. "Do you mind if\r\nI put that down in my book? You say it all so beautifully."\r\n\r\n"Without a few hours of relaxation," continued Miss Jones, "of private\r\nindemnification for the toilsome virtues displayed in public, who could\r\nwade through days of correct behaviour? There would be no reaction, no\r\nroom for better impulses, no place for repentance. Parents, priests, and\r\ngovernesses would be in the situation of a stout lady who never has a\r\nquiet moment in which she can take off her corsets."\r\n\r\n"My dear, what a firebrand!" whispered Irais. I got up and went in. They\r\nwere sitting on the sofa, Minora with clasped hands, gazing admiringly\r\ninto Miss Jones\'s face, which wore a very different expression from the\r\none of sour and unwilling propriety I have been used to seeing.\r\n\r\n"May I ask you to come to tea?" I said to Minora. "And I should like to\r\nhave the children a little while."\r\n\r\nShe got up very reluctantly, but I waited with the door open until she\r\nhad gone in and the two babies had followed. They had been playing at\r\nstuffing each other\'s ears with pieces of newspaper while Miss Jones\r\nprovided Minora with noble thoughts for her work, and had to be tortured\r\nafterward with tweezers. I said nothing to Minora, but kept her with us\r\ntill dinner-time, and this morning we went for a long sleigh-drive. When\r\nwe came in to lunch there was no Miss Jones.\r\n\r\n"Is Miss Jones ill?" asked Minora.\r\n\r\n"She is gone," I said.\r\n\r\n"Gone?"\r\n\r\n"Did you never hear of such things as sick mothers?" asked Irais\r\nblandly; and we talked resolutely of something else.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon Minora has moped. She had found a kindred spirit, and\r\nit has been ruthlessly torn from her arms as kindred spirits so often\r\nare. It is enough to make her mope, and it is not her fault, poor thing,\r\nthat she should have preferred the society of a Miss Jones to that of\r\nIrais and myself.\r\n\r\nAt dinner Irais surveyed her with her head on one side. "You look so\r\npale," she said; "are you not well?"\r\n\r\nMinora raised her eyes heavily, with the patient air of one who likes to\r\nbe thought a sufferer. "I have a slight headache," she replied gently.\r\n\r\n"I hope you are not going to be ill," said Irais with great concern,\r\n"because there is only a cow-doctor to be had here, and though he means\r\nwell, I believe he is rather rough." Minora was plainly startled. "But\r\nwhat do you do if you are ill?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we are never ill," said I; "the very knowledge that there would be\r\nno one to cure us seems to keep us healthy."\r\n\r\n"And if any one takes to her bed," said Irais, "Elizabeth always calls\r\nin the cow-doctor."\r\n\r\nMinora was silent. She feels, I am sure, that she has got into a part\r\nof the world peopled solely by barbarians, and that the only civilised\r\ncreature besides herself has departed and left her at our mercy.\r\nWhatever her reflections may be her symptoms are visibly abating.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 1st.--The service on New Year\'s Eve is the only one in the whole\r\nyear that in the least impresses me in our little church, and then the\r\nvery bareness and ugliness of the place and the ceremonial produce an\r\neffect that a snug service in a well-lit church never would. Last night\r\nwe took Irais and Minora, and drove the three lonely miles in a sleigh.\r\nIt was pitch-dark, and blowing great guns. We sat wrapped up to our eyes\r\nin furs, and as mute as a funeral procession.\r\n\r\n"We are going to the burial of our last year\'s sins," said Irais, as we\r\nstarted; and there certainly was a funereal sort of feeling in the air.\r\nUp in our gallery pew we tried to decipher our chorales by the light\r\nof the spluttering tallow candles stuck in holes in the woodwork, the\r\nflames wildly blown about by the draughts. The wind banged against the\r\nwindows in great gusts, screaming louder than the organ, and threatening\r\nto blow out the agitated lights together. The parson in his gloomy\r\npulpit, surrounded by a framework of dusty carved angels, took on an\r\nawful appearance of menacing Authority as he raised his voice to make\r\nhimself heard above the clatter. Sitting there in the dark, I felt\r\nvery small, and solitary, and defenceless, alone in a great, big, black\r\nworld. The church was as cold as a tomb; some of the candles guttered\r\nand went out; the parson in his black robe spoke of death and judgment;\r\nI thought I heard a child\'s voice screaming, and could hardly believe it\r\nwas only the wind, and felt uneasy and full of forebodings; all my faith\r\nand philosophy deserted me, and I had a horrid feeling that I should\r\nprobably be well punished, though for what I had no precise idea. If it\r\nhad not been so dark, and if the wind had not howled so despairingly,\r\nI should have paid little attention to the threats issuing from the\r\npulpit; but, as it was, I fell to making good resolutions. This is\r\nalways a bad sign,--only those who break them make them; and if you\r\nsimply do as a matter of course that which is right as it comes, any\r\npreparatory resolving to do so becomes completely superfluous. I have\r\nfor some years past left off making them on New Year\'s Eve, and only the\r\ngale happening as it did reduced me to doing so last night; for I have\r\nlong since discovered that, though the year and the resolutions may be\r\nnew, I myself am not, and it is worse than useless putting new wine into\r\nold bottles.\r\n\r\n"But I am not an old bottle," said Irais indignantly, when I held forth\r\nto her to the above effect a few hours later in the library, restored\r\nto all my philosophy by the warmth and light, "and I find my resolutions\r\ncarry me very nicely into the spring. I revise them at the end of each\r\nmonth, and strike out the unnecessary ones. By the end of April they\r\nhave been so severely revised that there are none left."\r\n\r\n"There, you see I am right; if you were not an old bottle your new\r\ncontents would gradually arrange themselves amiably as a part of you,\r\nand the practice of your resolutions would lose its bitterness by\r\nbecoming a habit."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. "Such things never lose their bitterness," she said,\r\n"and that is why I don\'t let them cling to me right into the summer.\r\nWhen May comes, I give myself up to jollity with all the rest of the\r\nworld, and am too busy being happy to bother about anything I may have\r\nresolved when the days were cold and dark."\r\n\r\n"And that is just why I love you," I thought. She often says what I\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," she went on after a pause, "whether men ever make\r\nresolutions?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they do. Only women indulge in such luxuries. It is a\r\nnice sort of feeling, when you have nothing else to do, giving way\r\nto endless grief and penitence, and steeping yourself to the eyes in\r\ncontrition; but it is silly. Why cry over things that are done? Why do\r\nnaughty things at all, if you are going to repent afterward? Nobody is\r\nnaughty unless they like being naughty; and nobody ever really repents\r\nunless they are afraid they are going to be found out."\r\n\r\n"By \'nobody\' of course you mean women, said Irais.\r\n\r\n"Naturally; the terms are synonymous. Besides, men generally have the\r\ncourage of their opinions."\r\n\r\n"I hope you are listening, Miss Minora," said Irais in the amiably\r\npolite tone she assumes whenever she speaks to that young person.\r\n\r\nIt was getting on towards midnight, and we were sitting round the fire,\r\nwaiting for the New Year, and sipping Glubwein, prepared at a small\r\ntable by the Man of Wrath. It was hot, and sweet, and rather nasty, but\r\nit is proper to drink it on this one night, so of course we did.\r\n\r\nMinora does not like either Irais or myself. We very soon discovered\r\nthat, and laugh about it when we are alone together. I can understand\r\nher disliking Irais, but she must be a perverse creature not to like me.\r\nIrais has poked fun at her, and I have been, I hope, very kind; yet we\r\nare bracketed together in her black books. It is also apparent that she\r\nlooks upon the Man of Wrath as an interesting example of an ill-used and\r\nmisunderstood husband, and she is disposed to take him under her wing,\r\nand defend him on all occasions against us. He never speaks to her; he\r\nis at all times a man of few words, but, as far as Minora is concerned,\r\nhe might have no tongue at all, and sits sphinx-like and impenetrable\r\nwhile she takes us to task about some remark of a profane nature that we\r\nmay have addressed to him. One night, some days after her arrival, she\r\ndeveloped a skittishness of manner which has since disappeared, and\r\ntried to be playful with him; but you might as well try to be playful\r\nwith a graven image. The wife of one of the servants had just produced a\r\nboy, the first after a series of five daughters, and at dinner we drank\r\nthe health of all parties concerned, the Man of Wrath making the\r\nhappy father drink a glass off at one gulp, his heels well together in\r\nmilitary fashion. Minora thought the incident typical of German\r\nmanners, and not only made notes about it, but joined heartily in the\r\nhealth-drinking, and afterward grew skittish.\r\n\r\nShe proposed, first of all, to teach us a dance called, I think, the\r\nWashington Post, and which was, she said, much danced in England;\r\nand, to induce us to learn, she played the tune to us on the piano.\r\nWe remained untouched by its beauties, each buried in an easy-chair\r\ntoasting our toes at the fire. Amongst those toes were those of the\r\nMan of Wrath, who sat peaceably reading a book and smoking. Minora\r\nvolunteered to show us the steps, and as we still did not move, danced\r\nsolitary behind our chairs. Irais did not even turn her head to look,\r\nand I was the only one amiable or polite enough to do so. Do I deserve\r\nto be placed in Minora\'s list of disagreeable people side by side with\r\nIrais? Certainly not. Yet I most surely am.\r\n\r\n"It wants the music, of course," observed Minora breathlessly, darting\r\nin and out between the chairs, apparently addressing me, but glancing at\r\nthe Man of Wrath.\r\n\r\nNo answer from anybody.\r\n\r\n"It is such a pretty dance," she panted again, after a few more\r\ngyrations.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n"And is all the rage at home."\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n"Do let me teach you. Won\'t you try, Herr Sage?"\r\n\r\nShe went up to him and dropped him a little curtesy. It is thus she\r\nalways addresses him, entirely oblivious to the fact, so patent to every\r\none else, that he resents it.\r\n\r\n"Oh come, put away that tiresome old book," she went on gaily, as he did\r\nnot move; "I am certain it is only some dry agricultural work that you\r\njust nod over. Dancing is much better for you." Irais and I looked at\r\none another quite frightened. I am sure we both turned pale when the\r\nunhappy girl actually laid hold forcibly of his book, and, with a\r\nplayful little shriek, ran away with it into the next room, hugging it\r\nto her bosom and looking back roguishly over her shoulder at him as she\r\nran. There was an awful pause. We hardly dared raise our eyes. Then the\r\nMall of Wrath got up slowly, knocked the ashes off the end of his cigar,\r\nlooked at his watch, and went out at the opposite door into his own\r\nrooms, where he stayed for the rest of the evening. She has never, I\r\nmust say, been skittish since.\r\n\r\n"I hope you are listening, Miss Minora," said Irais, "because this sort\r\nof conversation is likely to do you good."\r\n\r\n"I always listen when people talk sensibly," replied Minora, stirring\r\nher grog.\r\n\r\nIrais glanced at her with slightly doubtful eyebrows. "Do you agree with\r\nour hostess\'s description of women?" she asked after a pause.\r\n\r\n"As nobodies? No, of course I do not."\r\n\r\n"Yet she is right. In the eye of the law we are literally nobodies in\r\nour country. Did you know that women are forbidden to go to political\r\nmeetings here?" "Really?" Out came the note-book.\r\n\r\n"The law expressly forbids the attendance at such meetings of women,\r\nchildren, and idiots."\r\n\r\n"Children and idiots--I understand that," said Minora; "but women--and\r\nclassed with children and idiots?"\r\n\r\n"Classed with children and idiots," repeated Irais, gravely nodding her\r\nhead. "Did you know that the law forbids females of any age to ride on\r\nthe top of omnibuses or tramcars?"\r\n\r\n"Not really?"\r\n\r\n"Do you know why?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t imagine."\r\n\r\n"Because in going up and down the stairs those inside might perhaps\r\ncatch a glimpse of the stocking covering their ankles."\r\n\r\n"But what--"\r\n\r\n"Did you know that the morals of the German public are in such a shaky\r\ncondition that a glimpse of that sort would be fatal to them?"\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t see how a stocking--"\r\n\r\n"With stripes round it," said Irais.\r\n\r\n"And darns in it," I added, "--could possibly be pernicious?"\r\n\r\n"\'The Pernicious Stocking; or, Thoughts on the Ethics of Petticoats,\'"\r\nsaid Irais. "Put that down as the name of your next book on Germany."\r\n\r\n"I never know," complained Minora, letting her note-book fall, "whether\r\nyou are in earnest or not."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you?" said Irais sweetly.\r\n\r\n"Is it true," appealed Minora to the Man of Wrath, busy with his lemons\r\nin the background, "that your law classes women with children and\r\nidiots?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," he answered promptly, "and a very proper classification,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nWe all looked blank. "That\'s rude," said I at last.\r\n\r\n"Truth is always rude, my dear," he replied complacently. Then he added,\r\n"If I were commissioned to draw up a new legal code, and had previously\r\nenjoyed the privilege, as I have been doing lately, of listening to the\r\nconversation of you three young ladies, I should make precisely the same\r\nclassification."\r\n\r\nEven Minora was incensed at this.\r\n\r\n"You are telling us in the most unvarnished manner that we are idiots,"\r\nsaid Irais.\r\n\r\n"Idiots? No, no, by no means. But children,--nice little agreeable\r\nchildren. I very much like to hear you talk together. It is all so young\r\nand fresh what you think and what you believe, and not of the least\r\nconsequence to any one.\r\n\r\n"Not of the least consequence?" cried Minora. "What we believe is of\r\nvery great consequence indeed to us."\r\n\r\n"Are you jeering at our beliefs?" inquired Irais sternly.\r\n\r\n"Not for worlds. I would not on any account disturb or change your\r\npretty little beliefs. It is your chief charm that you always believe\r\nevery-thing. How desperate would our case be if young ladies only\r\nbelieved facts, and never accepted another person\'s assurance, but\r\npreferred the evidence of their own eyes! They would have no illusions,\r\nand a woman without illusions is the dreariest and most difficult thing\r\nto manage possible."\r\n\r\n"Thing?" protested Irais.\r\n\r\nThe Man of Wrath, usually so silent, makes up for it from time to time\r\nby holding forth at unnecessary length. He took up his stand now with\r\nhis back to the fire, and a glass of Glubwein in his hand. Minora had\r\nhardly heard his voice before, so quiet had he been since she came, and\r\nsat with her pencil raised, ready to fix for ever the wisdom that should\r\nflow from his lips.\r\n\r\n"What would become of poetry if women became so sensible that they\r\nturned a deaf ear to the poetic platitudes of love? That love does\r\nindulge in platitudes I suppose you will admit." He looked at Irais.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they all say exactly the same thing," she acknowledged.\r\n\r\n"Who could murmur pretty speeches on the beauty of a common sacrifice,\r\nif the listener\'s want of imagination was such as to enable her only to\r\ndistinguish one victim in the picture, and that one herself?"\r\n\r\nMinora took that down word for word,--much good may it do her.\r\n\r\n"Who would be brave enough to affirm that if refused he will die, if\r\nhis assurances merely elicit a recommendation to diet himself, and take\r\nplenty of outdoor exercise? Women are responsible for such lies, because\r\nthey believe them. Their amazing vanity makes them swallow flattery so\r\ngross that it is an insult, and men will always be ready to tell the\r\nprecise number of lies that a woman is ready to listen to. Who indulges\r\nmore recklessly in glowing exaggerations than the lover who hopes, and\r\nhas not yet obtained? He will, like the nightingale, sing with unceasing\r\nmodulations, display all his talent, untiringly repeat his\r\nsweetest notes, until he has what he wants, when his song, like the\r\nnightingale\'s, immediately ceases, never again to be heard."\r\n\r\n"Take that down," murmured Irais aside to Minora--unnecessary advice,\r\nfor her pencil was scribbling as fast as it could.\r\n\r\n"A woman\'s vanity is so immeasurable that, after having had ninety-nine\r\nobject-lessons in the difference between promise and performance and the\r\nemptiness of pretty speeches, the beginning of the hundredth will find\r\nher lending the same willing and enchanted ear to the eloquence\r\nof flattery as she did on the occasion of the first. What can the\r\nexhortations of the strong-minded sister, who has never had these\r\nexperiences, do for such a woman? It is useless to tell her she is man\'s\r\nvictim, that she is his plaything, that she is cheated, down-trodden,\r\nkept under, laughed at, shabbily treated in every way--that is not a\r\ntrue statement of the case. She is simply the victim of her own vanity,\r\nand against that, against the belief in her own fascinations, against\r\nthe very part of herself that gives all the colour to her life, who\r\nshall expect a woman to take up arms?"\r\n\r\n"Are you so vain, Elizabeth?" inquired Irais with a shocked face, "and\r\nhad you lent a willing ear to the blandishments of ninety-nine before\r\nyou reached your final destiny?"\r\n\r\n"I am one of the sensible ones, I suppose," I replied, "for nobody ever\r\nwanted me to listen to blandishments."\r\n\r\nMinora sighed.\r\n\r\n"I like to hear you talk together about the position of women," he\r\nwent on, "and wonder when you will realise that they hold exactly\r\nthe position they are fitted for. As soon as they are fit to occupy\r\na better, no power on earth will be able to keep them out of it.\r\nMeanwhile, let me warn you that, as things now are, only strong-minded\r\nwomen wish to see you the equals of men, and the strong-minded are\r\ninvariably plain. The pretty ones would rather see men their slaves than\r\ntheir equals."\r\n\r\n"You know," said Irais, frowning, "that I consider myself\r\nstrong-minded."\r\n\r\n"And never rise till lunch-time?"\r\n\r\nIrais blushed. Although I don\'t approve of such conduct, it is very\r\nconvenient in more ways than one; I get through my housekeeping\r\nundisturbed, and whenever she is disposed to lecture me, I begin about\r\nthis habit of hers. Her conscience must be terribly stricken on the\r\npoint, for she is by no means as a rule given to meekness.\r\n\r\n"A woman without vanity would be unattackable," resumed the Man of\r\nWrath. "When a girl enters that downward path that leads to ruin, she\r\nis led solely by her own vanity; for in these days of policemen no young\r\nwoman can be forced against her will from the path of virtue, and the\r\ncries of the injured are never heard until the destroyer begins to\r\nexpress his penitence for having destroyed. If his passion could\r\nremain at white-heat and he could continue to feed her ear with the\r\nprotestations she loves, no principles of piety or virtue would disturb\r\nthe happiness of his companion; for a mournful experience teaches that\r\npiety begins only where passion ends, and that principles are strongest\r\nwhere temptations are most rare."\r\n\r\n"But what has all this to do with us?" I inquired severely.\r\n\r\n"You were displeased at our law classing you as it does, and I merely\r\nwish to justify it," he answered. "Creatures who habitually say yes to\r\neverything a man proposes, when no one can oblige them to say it, and\r\nwhen it is so often fatal, are plainly not responsible beings."\r\n\r\n"I shall never say it to you again, my dear man," I said.\r\n\r\n"And not only that fatal weakness," he continued, "but what is there,\r\ncandidly, to distinguish you from children? You are older, but not\r\nwiser,--really not so wise, for with years you lose the common sense you\r\nhad as children. Have you ever heard a group of women talking reasonably\r\ntogether?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--we do!" Irais and I cried in a breath.\r\n\r\n"It has interested me," went on the Man of Wrath, "in my idle moments,\r\nto listen to their talk. It amused me to hear the malicious little\r\nstories they told of their best friends who were absent, to note the\r\nspiteful little digs they gave their best friends who were present, to\r\nwatch the utter incredulity with which they listened to the tale of\r\nsome other woman\'s conquests, the radiant good faith they displayed in\r\nconnection with their own, the instant collapse into boredom, if some\r\ntopic of so-called general interest, by some extraordinary chance,\r\nwere introduced." "You must have belonged to a particularly nice set,"\r\nremarked Irais.\r\n\r\n"And as for politics," he said, "I have never heard them mentioned among\r\nwomen."\r\n\r\n"Children and idiots are not interested in such things," I said.\r\n\r\n"And we are much too frightened of being put in prison," said Irais.\r\n\r\n"In prison?" echoed Minora.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know," said Irais, turning to her "that if you talk about\r\nsuch things here you run a great risk of being imprisoned?"\r\n\r\n"But why?"\r\n\r\n"But why? Because, though you yourself may have meant nothing but what\r\nwas innocent, your words may have suggested something less innocent to\r\nthe evil minds of your hearers; and then the law steps in, and calls\r\nit dolus eventualis, and everybody says how dreadful, and off you go to\r\nprison and are punished as you deserve to be."\r\n\r\nMinora looked mystified.\r\n\r\n"That is not, however, your real reason for not discussing them," said\r\nthe Man of Wrath; "they simply do not interest you. Or it may be, that\r\nyou do not consider your female friends\' opinions worth listening to,\r\nfor you certainly display an astonishing thirst for information when\r\nmale politicians are present. I have seen a pretty young woman, hardly\r\nin her twenties, sitting a whole evening drinking in the doubtful wisdom\r\nof an elderly political star, with every appearance of eager interest.\r\nHe was a bimetallic star, and was giving her whole pamphletsful of\r\ninformation."\r\n\r\n"She wanted to make up to him for some reason," said Irais, "and got him\r\nto explain his hobby to her, and he was silly enough to be taken in. Now\r\nwhich was the sillier in that case?"\r\n\r\nShe threw herself back in her chair and looked up defiantly, beating her\r\nfoot impatiently on the carpet.\r\n\r\n"She wanted to be thought clever," said the Man of Wrath. "What puzzled\r\nme," he went on musingly, "was that she went away apparently as serene\r\nand happy as when she came. The explanation of the principles of\r\nbimetallism produce, as a rule, a contrary effect."\r\n\r\n"Why, she hadn\'t been listening," cried Irais, "and your simple star had\r\nbeen making a fine goose of himself the whole evening.\r\n\r\n            "Prattle, prattle, simple star,\r\n             Bimetallic, wunderbar.\r\n            Though you\'re given to describe\r\n            Woman as a dummes Weib.\r\n            You yourself are sillier far,\r\n            Prattling, bimetallic star!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt she had understood very little," said the Man of Wrath, taking\r\nno notice of this effusion.\r\n\r\n"And no doubt the gentleman hadn\'t understood much either." Irais was\r\nplainly irritated.\r\n\r\n"Your opinion of woman," said Minora in a very small voice, "is not\r\na high one. But, in the sick chamber, I suppose you agree that no one\r\ncould take her place?"\r\n\r\n"If you are thinking of hospital-nurses," I said, "I must tell you that\r\nI believe he married chiefly that he might have a wife instead of a\r\nstrange woman to nurse him when he is sick."\r\n\r\n"But," said Minora, bewildered at the way her illusions were being\r\nknocked about, "the sick-room is surely the very place of all others in\r\nwhich a woman\'s gentleness and tact are most valuable."\r\n\r\n"Gentleness and tact?" repeated the Man of Wrath. "I have never met\r\nthose qualities in the professional nurse. According to my experience,\r\nshe is a disagreeable person who finds in private nursing exquisite\r\nopportunities for asserting her superiority over ordinary and prostrate\r\nmankind. I know of no more humiliating position for a man than to be\r\nin bed having his feverish brow soothed by a sprucely-dressed strange\r\nwoman, bristling with starch and spotlessness. He would give half his\r\nincome for his clothes, and probably the other half if she would leave\r\nhim alone, and go away altogether. He feels her superiority through\r\nevery pore; he never before realised how absolutely inferior he is; he\r\nis abjectly polite, and contemptibly conciliatory; if a friend comes to\r\nsee him, he eagerly praises her in case she should be listening behind\r\nthe screen; he cannot call his soul his own, and, what is far more\r\nintolerable, neither is he sure that his body really belongs to him; he\r\nhas read of ministering angels and the light touch of a woman\'s hand,\r\nbut the day on which he can ring for his servant and put on his socks in\r\nprivate fills him with the same sort of wildness of joy that he felt as\r\na homesick schoolboy at the end of his first term."\r\n\r\nMinora was silent. Irais\'s foot was livelier than ever. The Man of Wrath\r\nstood smiling blandly down upon us. You can\'t argue with a person so\r\nutterly convinced of his infallibility that he won\'t even get angry with\r\nyou; so we sat round and said nothing.\r\n\r\n"If," he went on, addressing Irais, who looked rebellious, "you doubt\r\nthe truth of my remarks, and still cling to the old poetic notion of\r\nnoble, self-sacrificing women tenderly helping the patient over the\r\nrough places on the road to death or recovery, let me beg you to try\r\nfor yourself, next time any one in your house is ill, whether the actual\r\nfact in any way corresponds to the picturesque belief. The angel who is\r\nto alleviate our sufferings comes in such a questionable shape, that\r\nto the unimaginative she appears merely as an extremely self-confident\r\nyoung woman, wisely concerned first of all in securing her personal\r\ncomfort, much given to complaints about her food and to helplessness\r\nwhere she should be helpful, possessing an extraordinary capacity for\r\nfancying herself slighted, or not regarded as the superior being she\r\nknows herself to be, morbidly anxious lest the servants should, by some\r\nmistake, treat her with offensive cordiality, pettish if the patient\r\ngives more trouble than she had expected, intensely injured and\r\ndisagreeable if he is made so courageous by his wretchedness as to wake\r\nher during the night--an act of desperation of which I was guilty once,\r\nand once only. Oh, these good women! What sane man wants to have to do\r\nwith angels? And especially do we object to having them about us when we\r\nare sick and sorry, when we feel in every fibre what poor things we are,\r\nand when all our fortitude is needed to enable us to bear our temporary\r\ninferiority patiently, without being forced besides to assume an\r\nattitude of eager and grovelling politeness towards the angel in the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know you could talk so much, Sage," said Irais at length.\r\n\r\n"What would you have women do, then?" asked Minora meekly. Irais began\r\nto beat her foot up and down again,--what did it matter what Men of\r\nWrath would have us do? "There are not," continued Minora, blushing,\r\n"husbands enough for every one, and the rest must do something."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," replied the oracle. "Study the art of pleasing by dress and\r\nmanner as long as you are of an age to interest us, and above all,\r\nlet all women, pretty and plain, married and single, study the art\r\nof cookery. If you are an artist in the kitchen you will always be\r\nesteemed."\r\n\r\nI sat very still. Every German woman, even the wayward Irais, has\r\nlearned to cook; I seem to have been the only one who was naughty and\r\nwouldn\'t.\r\n\r\n"Only be careful," he went on, "in studying both arts, never to forget\r\nthe great truth that dinner precedes blandishments and not blandishments\r\ndinner. A man must be made comfortable before he will make love to you;\r\nand though it is true that if you offered him a choice between Spickgans\r\nand kisses, he would say he would take both, yet he would invariably\r\nbegin with the Spickgans, and allow the kisses to wait."\r\n\r\nAt this I got up, and Irais followed my example. "Your cynicism is\r\ndisgusting," I said icily.\r\n\r\n"You two are always exceptions to anything I may say," he said, smiling\r\namiably.\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed Irais\'s hand. She is inordinately vain of her\r\nhands, and says her husband married her for their sake, which I can\r\nquite believe. I am glad they are on her and not on Minora, for if\r\nMinora had had them I should have been annoyed. Minora\'s are bony, with\r\nchilly-looking knuckles, ignored nails, and too much wrist. I feel very\r\nwell disposed towards her when my eye falls on them. She put one forward\r\nnow, evidently thinking it would be kissed too.\r\n\r\n"Did you know," said Irais, seeing the movement, "that it is the custom\r\nhere to kiss women\'s hands?"\r\n\r\n"But only married women\'s," I added, not desiring her to feel out of it,\r\n"never young girls\'."\r\n\r\nShe drew it in again. "It is a pretty custom," she said with a sigh; and\r\npensively inscribed it in her book.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 15th.--The bills for my roses and bulbs and other last year\'s\r\nhorticultural indulgences were all on the table when I came down\r\nto breakfast this morning. They rather frightened me. Gardening is\r\nexpensive, I find, when it has to be paid for out of one\'s own private\r\npin-money. The Man of Wrath does not in the least want roses, or\r\nflowering shrubs, or plantations, or new paths, and therefore, he asks,\r\nwhy should he pay for them? So he does not and I do, and I have to make\r\nup for it by not indulging all too riotously in new clothes, which is no\r\ndoubt very chastening. I certainly prefer buying new rose-trees to new\r\ndresses, if I cannot comfortably have both; and I see a time coming when\r\nthe passion for my garden will have taken such a hold on me that I shall\r\nnot only entirely cease buying more clothes, but begin to sell those\r\nthat I already have. The garden is so big that everything has to be\r\nbought wholesale; and I fear I shall not be able to go on much longer\r\nwith only one man and a stork, because the more I plant the more there\r\nwill be to water in the inevitable drought, and the watering is a\r\nserious consideration when it means going backwards and forwards all day\r\nlong to a pump near the house, with a little water-cart. People living\r\nin England, in almost perpetual mildness and moisture, don\'t really know\r\nwhat a drought is. If they have some weeks of cloudless weather, it is\r\ngenerally preceded and followed by good rains; but we have perhaps an\r\nhour\'s shower every week, and then comes a month or six weeks\' drought.\r\nThe soil is very light, and dries so quickly that, after the heaviest\r\nthunder-shower, I can walk over any of my paths in my thin shoes; and to\r\nkeep the garden even moderately damp it should pour with rain regularly\r\nevery day for three hours. My only means of getting water is to go to\r\nthe pump near the house, or to the little stream that forms my eastern\r\nboundary, and the little stream dries up too unless there has been rain,\r\nand is at the best of times difficult to get at, having steep banks\r\ncovered with forget-me-nots. I possess one moist, peaty bit of ground,\r\nand that is to be planted with silver birches in imitation of the\r\nHirschwald, and is to be carpeted between the birches with flaming\r\nazaleas. All the rest of my soil is sandy--the soil for pines and\r\nacacias, but not the soil for roses; yet see what love will do--there\r\nare more roses in my garden than any other flower! Next spring the bare\r\nplaces are to be filled with trees that I have ordered: pines behind the\r\ndelicate acacias, and startling mountain-ashes, oaks, copper-beeches,\r\nmaples, larches, juniper-trees--was it not Elijah who sat down to rest\r\nunder a juniper-tree? I have often wondered how he managed to get under\r\nit. It is a compact little tree, not more than two to three yards high\r\nhere, and all closely squeezed up together. Perhaps they grew more\r\naggressively where he was. By the time the babies have grown old and\r\ndisagreeable it will be very pretty here, and then possibly they won\'t\r\nlike it; and, if they have inherited the Man of Wrath\'s indifference to\r\ngardens, they will let it run wild and leave it to return to the state\r\nin which I found it. Or perhaps their three husbands will refuse to live\r\nin it, or to come to such a lonely place at all, and then of course its\r\nfate is sealed. My only comfort is that husbands don\'t flourish in the\r\ndesert, and that the three will have to wait a long time before enough\r\nare found to go round. Mothers tell me that it is a dreadful business\r\nfinding one husband; how much more painful then to have to look for\r\nthree at once!--the babies are so nearly the same age that they only\r\njust escaped being twins. But I won\'t look. I can imagine nothing more\r\nuncomfortable than a son-in-law, and besides, I don\'t think a husband is\r\nat all a good thing for a girl to have. I shall do my best in the years\r\nat my disposal to train them so to love the garden, and out-door life,\r\nand even farming, that, if they have a spark of their mother in them,\r\nthey will want and ask for nothing better. My hope of success is however\r\nexceedingly small, and there is probably a fearful period in store for\r\nme when I shall be taken every day during the winter to the distant\r\ntowns to balls--a poor old mother shivering in broad daylight in her\r\nparty gown, and being made to start after an early lunch and not\r\ngetting home till breakfast-time next morning. Indeed, they have already\r\ndeveloped an alarming desire to go to "partings" as they call them, the\r\nApril baby announcing her intention of beginning to do so when she is\r\ntwelve. "Are you twelve, Mummy?" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe gardener is leaving on the first of April, and I am trying to find\r\nanother. It is grievous changing so often--in two years I shall have\r\nhad three--because at each change a great part of my plants and plans\r\nnecessarily suffers. Seeds get lost, seedlings are not pricked out in\r\ntime, places already sown are planted with something else, and there\r\nis confusion out of doors and despair in my heart. But he was to have\r\nmarried the cook, and the cook saw a ghost and immediately left, and he\r\nis going after her as soon as he can, and meanwhile is wasting visibly\r\naway. What she saw was doors that are locked opening with a great\r\nclatter all by themselves on the hingeside, and then somebody invisible\r\ncursed at her. These phenomena now go by the name of "the ghost." She\r\nasked to be allowed to leave at once, as she had never been in a place\r\nwhere there was a ghost before. I suggested that she should try and get\r\nused to it; but she thought it would be wasting time, and she looked so\r\nill that I let her go, and the garden has to suffer. I don\'t know why\r\nit should be given to cooks to see such interesting things and withheld\r\nfrom me, but I have had two others since she left, and they both have\r\nseen the ghost. Minora grows very silent as bed-time approaches, and\r\nrelents towards Irais and myself; and, after having shown us all day how\r\nlittle she approves us, when the bedroom candles are brought she quite\r\nbegins to cling. She has once or twice anxiously inquired whether Irais\r\nis sure she does not object to sleeping alone.\r\n\r\n"If you are at all nervous, I will come and keep you company," she said;\r\n"I don\'t mind at all, I assure you."\r\n\r\nBut Irais is not to be taken in by such simple wiles, and has told me\r\nshe would rather sleep with fifty ghosts than with one Minora.\r\n\r\nSince Miss Jones was so unexpectedly called away to her parent\'s bedside\r\nI have seen a good deal of the babies; and it is so nice without a\r\ngoverness that I would put off engaging another for a year or two, if it\r\nwere not that I should in so doing come within the reach of the arm of\r\nthe law, which is what every German spends his life in trying to avoid.\r\nThe April baby will be six next month, and, after her sixth birthday\r\nis passed, we are liable at any moment to receive a visit from a school\r\ninspector, who will inquire curiously into the state of her education,\r\nand, if it is not up to the required standard, all sorts of fearful\r\nthings might happen to the guilty parents, probably beginning with\r\nfines, and going on crescendo to dungeons if, owing to gaps between\r\ngovernesses and difficulties in finding the right one, we persisted in\r\nour evil courses. Shades of the prison-house begin to close here upon\r\nthe growing boy, and prisons compass the Teuton about on every side\r\nall through life to such an extent that he has to walk very delicately\r\nindeed if he would stay outside them and pay for their maintenance.\r\nCultured individuals do not, as a rule, neglect to teach their offspring\r\nto read, and write, and say their prayers, and are apt to resent the\r\nintrusion of an examining inspector into their homes; but it does\r\nnot much matter after all, and I daresay it is very good for us to be\r\nworried; indeed, a philosopher of my acquaintance declares that people\r\nwho are not regularly and properly worried are never any good for\r\nanything. In the eye of the law we are all sinners, and every man is\r\nheld to be guilty until he has proved that he is innocent.\r\n\r\nMinora has seen so much of the babies that, after vainly trying to\r\nget out of their way for several days, she thought it better to resign\r\nherself, and make the best of it by regarding them as copy, and using\r\nthem to fill a chapter in her book. So she took to dogging their\r\nfootsteps wherever they went, attended their uprisings and their lyings\r\ndown, engaged them, if she could, in intelligent conversation, went with\r\nthem into the garden to study their ways when they were sleighing, drawn\r\nby a big dog, and generally made their lives a burden to them. This went\r\non for three days, and then she settled down to write the result with\r\nthe Man of Wrath\'s typewriter, borrowed whenever her notes for any\r\nchapter have reached the state of ripeness necessary for the process\r\nshe describes as "throwing into form." She writes everything with a\r\ntypewriter, even her private letters.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget to put in something about a mother\'s knee," said Irais;\r\n"you can\'t write effectively about children without that." "Oh, of\r\ncourse I shall mention that," replied Minora.\r\n\r\n"And pink toes," I added. "There are always toes, and they are never\r\nanything but pink."\r\n\r\n"I have that somewhere," said Minora, turning over her notes.\r\n\r\n"But, after all, babies are not a German speciality," said Irais, "and I\r\ndon\'t quite see why you should bring them into a book of German travels.\r\nElizabeth\'s babies have each got the fashionable number of arms and\r\nlegs, and are exactly the same as English ones."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but they can\'t be just the same, you know," said Minora, looking\r\nworried. "It must make a difference living here in this place, and\r\neating such odd things, and never having a doctor, and never being ill.\r\nChildren who have never had measles and those things can\'t be quite the\r\nsame as other children; it must all be in their systems and can\'t get\r\nout for some reason or other. And a child brought up on chicken and\r\nrice-pudding must be different to a child that eats Spickgans and liver\r\nsausages. And they are different; I can\'t tell in what way, but\r\nthey certainly are; and I think if I steadily describe them from the\r\nmaterials I have collected the last three days, I may perhaps hit on the\r\npoints of difference."\r\n\r\n"Why bother about points of difference?" asked Irais. "I should write\r\nsome little thing, bringing in the usual parts of the picture, such as\r\nknees and toes, and make it mildly pathetic."\r\n\r\n"But it is by no means an easy thing for me to do," said Minora\r\nplaintively; "I have so little experience of children."\r\n\r\n"Then why write it at all?" asked that sensible person Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n"I have as little experience as you," said Irais, "because I have no\r\nchildren; but if you don\'t yearn after startling originality, nothing is\r\neasier than to write bits about them. I believe I could do a dozen in an\r\nhour."\r\n\r\nShe sat down at the writing-table, took up an old letter, and scribbled\r\nfor about five minutes. "There," she said, throwing it to Minora, "you\r\nmay have it--pink toes and all complete."\r\n\r\nMinora put on her eye-glasses and read aloud:\r\n\r\n"When my baby shuts her eyes and sings her hymns at bed-time my stale\r\nand battered soul is filled with awe. All sorts of vague memories crowd\r\ninto my mind--memories of my own mother and myself--how many years\r\nago!--of the sweet helplessness of being gathered up half asleep in her\r\narms, and undressed, and put in my cot, without being wakened; of the\r\nangels I believed in; of little children coming straight from heaven,\r\nand still being surrounded, so long as they were good, by the shadow of\r\nwhite wings,--all the dear poetic nonsense learned, just as my baby is\r\nlearning it, at her mother\'s knee. She has not an idea of the beauty\r\nof the charming things she is told, and stares wide-eyed, with heavenly\r\neyes, while her mother talks of the heaven she has so lately come from,\r\nand is relieved and comforted by the interrupting bread and milk. At two\r\nyears old she does not understand angels, and does understand bread and\r\nmilk; at five she has vague notions about them, and prefers bread and\r\nmilk; at ten both bread and milk and angels have been left behind in\r\nthe nursery, and she has already found out that they are luxuries not\r\nnecessary to her everyday life. In later years she may be disinclined to\r\naccept truths second-hand, insist on thinking for herself, be earnest in\r\nher desire to shake off exploded traditions, be untiring in her efforts\r\nto live according to a high moral standard and to be strong, and pure,\r\nand good--"\r\n\r\n"Like tea," explained Irais.\r\n\r\n"--yet will she never, with all her virtues, possess one-thousandth part\r\nof the charm that clung about her when she sang, with quiet eyelids, her\r\nfirst reluctant hymns, kneeling on her mother\'s knees. I love to come in\r\nat bed-time and sit in the window in the setting sunshine watching the\r\nmysteries of her going to bed. Her mother tubs her, for she is far too\r\nprecious to be touched by any nurse, and then she is rolled up in a\r\nbig bath towel, and only her little pink toes peep out; and when she is\r\npowdered, and combed, and tied up in her night-dress, and all her curls\r\nare on end, and her ears glowing, she is knelt down on her mother\'s lap,\r\na little bundle of fragrant flesh, and her face reflects the quiet of\r\nher mother\'s face as she goes through her evening prayer for pity and\r\nfor peace."\r\n\r\n"How very curious!" said Minora, when she had finished. "That is exactly\r\nwhat I was going to say."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then I have saved you the trouble of putting it together; you can\r\ncopy that if you like." "But have you a stale soul, Miss Minora?" I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Well, do you know, I rather think that is a good touch," she replied;\r\n"it will make people really think a man wrote the book. You know I am\r\ngoing to take a man\'s name."\r\n\r\n"That is precisely what I imagined," said Irais. "You will call yourself\r\nJohn Jones, or George Potts, or some such sternly commonplace name, to\r\nemphasise your uncompromising attitude towards all feminine weaknesses,\r\nand no one will be taken in."\r\n\r\n"I really think, Elizabeth," said Irais to me later, when the click of\r\nMinora\'s typewriter was heard hesitating in the next room, "that you and\r\nI are writing her book for her. She takes down everything we say. Why\r\ndoes she copy all that about the baby? I wonder why mothers\' knees are\r\nsupposed to be touching? I never learned anything at them, did you? But\r\nthen in my case they were only stepmother\'s, and nobody ever sings their\r\npraises."\r\n\r\n"My mother was always at parties," I said; "and the nurse made me say my\r\nprayers in French."\r\n\r\n"And as for tubs and powder," went on Irais, "when I was a baby such\r\nthings were not the fashion. There were never any bathrooms, and no\r\ntubs; our faces and hands were washed, and there was a foot-bath in the\r\nroom, and in the summer we had a bath and were put to bed afterwards for\r\nfear we might catch cold. My stepmother didn\'t worry much; she used to\r\nwear pink dresses all over lace, and the older she got the prettier the\r\ndresses got. When is she going?"\r\n\r\n"Who? Minora? I haven\'t asked her that."\r\n\r\n"Then I will. It is really bad for her art to be neglected like this.\r\nShe has been here an unconscionable time,--it must be nearly three\r\nweeks."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she came the same day you did," I said pleasantly.\r\n\r\nIrais was silent. I hope she was reflecting that it is not worse to\r\nneglect one\'s art than one\'s husband, and her husband is lying all this\r\ntime stretched on a bed of sickness, while she is spending her days so\r\nagreeably with me. She has a way of forgetting that she has a home, or\r\nany other business in the world than just to stay on chatting with me,\r\nand reading, and singing, and laughing at any one there is to laugh at,\r\nand kissing the babies, and tilting with the Man of Wrath. Naturally I\r\nlove her--she is so pretty that anybody with eyes in his head must love\r\nher--but too much of anything is bad, and next month the passages and\r\noffices are to be whitewashed, and people who have ever whitewashed\r\ntheir houses inside know what nice places they are to live in while it\r\nis being done; and there will be no dinner for Irais, and none of those\r\nsucculent salads full of caraway seeds that she so devotedly loves. I\r\nshall begin to lead her thoughts gently back to her duties by inquiring\r\nevery day anxiously after her husband\'s health. She is not very fond of\r\nhim, because he does not run and hold the door open for her every time\r\nshe gets up to leave the room; and though she has asked him to do so,\r\nand told him how much she wishes he would, he still won\'t. She stayed\r\nonce in a house where there was an Englishman, and his nimbleness in\r\nregard to doors and chairs so impressed her that her husband has had no\r\npeace since, and each time she has to go out of a room she is reminded\r\nof her disregarded wishes, so that a shut door is to her symbolic of the\r\nfailure of her married life, and the very sight of one makes her wonder\r\nwhy she was born; at least, that is what she told me once, in a burst\r\nof confidence. He is quite a nice, harmless little man, pleasant to talk\r\nto, good-tempered, and full of fun; but he thinks he is too old to begin\r\nto learn new and uncomfortable ways, and he has that horror of being\r\nmade better by his wife that distinguishes so many righteous men, and\r\nis shared by the Man of Wrath, who persists in holding his glass in\r\nhis left hand at meals, because if he did not (and I don\'t believe he\r\nparticularly likes doing it) his relations might say that marriage\r\nhas improved him, and thus drive the iron into his soul. This habit\r\noccasions an almost daily argument between one or other of the babies\r\nand myself.\r\n\r\n"April, hold your glass in your right hand."\r\n\r\n"But papa doesn\'t."\r\n\r\n"When you are as old as papa you can do as you like."\r\n\r\nWhich was embellished only yesterday by Minora adding impressively, "And\r\nonly think how strange it would look if everybody held their glasses\r\nso."\r\n\r\nApril was greatly struck by the force of this proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 28th.--It is very cold,--fifteen degrees of frost Reaumur, but\r\nperfectly delicious, still, bright weather, and one feels jolly and\r\nenergetic and amiably disposed towards everybody. The two young ladies\r\nare still here, but the air is so buoyant that even they don\'t weigh on\r\nme any longer, and besides, they have both announced their approaching\r\ndeparture, so that after all I shall get my whitewashing done in peace,\r\nand the house will have on its clean pinafore in time to welcome the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nMinora has painted my portrait, and is going to present it as a parting\r\ngift to the Man of Wrath; and the fact that I let her do it, and sat\r\nmeekly times innumerable, proves conclusively, I hope, that I am not\r\nvain. When Irais first saw it she laughed till she cried, and at once\r\ncommissioned her to paint hers, so that she may take it away with her\r\nand give it to her husband on his birthday, which happens to be early in\r\nFebruary. Indeed, if it were not for this birthday, I really think she\r\nwould have forgotten to go at all; but birthdays are great and solemn\r\nfestivals with us, never allowed to slip by unnoticed, and always\r\ncelebrated in the presence of a sympathetic crowd of relations (gathered\r\nfrom far and near to tell you how well you are wearing, and that nobody\r\nwould ever dream, and that really it is wonderful), who stand round\r\na sort of sacrificial altar, on which your years are offered up as\r\na burnt-offering to the gods in the shape of lighted pink and white\r\ncandles, stuck in a very large, flat, jammy cake. The cake with its\r\ncandles is the chief feature, and on the table round it lie the gifts\r\neach person present is more or less bound to give. As my birthday\r\nfalls in the winter I get mittens as well as blotting-books and\r\nphotograph-frames, and if it were in the summer I should get\r\nphotograph-frames and blotting-books and no mittens; but whatever the\r\npresent may be, and by whomsoever given, it has to be welcomed with the\r\nnoisiest gratitude, and loudest exclamations of joy, and such words as\r\nentzuckend, reizend, herrlich, wundervoll, and suss repeated over and\r\nover again, until the unfortunate Geburtstagskind feels indeed that\r\nanother year has gone, and that she has grown older, and wiser, and more\r\ntired of folly and of vain repetitions. A flag is hoisted, and all\r\nthe morning the rites are celebrated, the cake eaten, healths drunk,\r\nspeeches made, and hands nearly shaken off. The neighbouring parsons\r\ndrive up, and when nobody is looking their wives count the candles in\r\nthe cake; the active lady in the next Schlass spares time to send a pot\r\nof flowers, and to look up my age in the Gotha Almanach; a deputation\r\ncomes from the farms headed by the chief inspector in white kid gloves\r\nwho invokes Heaven\'s blessings on the gracious lady\'s head; and the\r\nbabies are enchanted, and sit in a corner trying on all the mittens.\r\nIn the evening there is a dinner for the relations and the chief local\r\nauthorities, with more health-drinking and speechifying, and the next\r\nmorning, when I come downstairs thankful to have done with it, I\r\nam confronted by the altar still in its place, cake crumbs and\r\ncandle-grease and all, because any hasty removal of it would imply a\r\nmost lamentable want of sentiment, deplorable in anybody, but scandalous\r\nand disgusting in a tender female. All birthdays are observed in this\r\nfashion, and not a few wise persons go for a short trip just about the\r\ntime theirs is due, and I think I shall imitate them next year; only\r\ntrips to the country or seaside in December are not usually pleasant,\r\nand if I go to a town there are sure to be relations in it, and then\r\nthe cake will spring up mushroom-like from the teeming soil of their\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nI hope it has been made evident in these pages how superior Irais and\r\nmyself are to the ordinary weaknesses of mankind; if any further proof\r\nwere needed, it is furnished by the fact that we both, in defiance of\r\ntradition, scorn this celebration of birthday rites. Years ago, when\r\nfirst I knew her, and long before we were either of us married, I sent\r\nher a little brass candlestick on her birthday; and when mine followed a\r\nfew months later, she sent me a note-book. No notes were written in it,\r\nand on her next birthday I presented it to her; she thanked me profusely\r\nin the customary manner, and when my turn came I received the brass\r\ncandlestick. Since then we alternately enjoy the possession of each of\r\nthese articles, and the present question is comfortably settled once\r\nand for all, at a minimum of trouble and expense. We never mention this\r\nlittle arrangement except at the proper time, when we send a letter of\r\nfervid thanks.\r\n\r\nThis radiant weather, when mere living is a joy, and sitting still over\r\nthe fire out of the question, has been going on for more than a week.\r\nSleighing and skating have been our chief occupation, especially\r\nskating, which is more than usually fascinating here, because the place\r\nis intersected by small canals communicating with a lake and the river\r\nbelonging to the lake, and as everything is frozen black and hard, we\r\ncan skate for miles straight ahead without being obliged to turn round\r\nand come back again,--at all times an annoying, and even mortifying,\r\nproceeding. Irais skates beautifully: modesty is the only obstacle to my\r\nsaying the same of myself; but I may remark that all Germans skate well,\r\nfor the simple reason that every year of their lives, for three or four\r\nmonths, they may do it as much as they like. Minora was astonished and\r\ndisconcerted by finding herself left behind, and arriving at the place\r\nwhere tea meets us half an hour after we had finished. In some places\r\nthe banks of the canals are so high that only our heads appear level\r\nwith the fields, and it is, as Minora noted in her book, a curious sight\r\nto see three female heads skimming along apparently by themselves,\r\nand enjoying it tremendously. When the banks are low, we appear to be\r\ngliding deliciously over the roughest ploughed fields, with or without\r\nlegs according to circumstances. Before we start, I fix on the place\r\nwhere tea and a sleigh are to meet us, and we drive home again;\r\nbecause skating against the wind is as detestable as skating with it\r\nis delightful, and an unkind Nature arranges its blowing without the\r\nsmallest regard for our convenience. Yesterday, by way of a change, we\r\nwent for a picnic to the shores of the Baltic, ice-bound at this\r\nseason, and utterly desolate at our nearest point. I have a weakness for\r\npicnics, especially in winter, when the mosquitoes cease from troubling\r\nand the ant-hills are at rest; and of all my many favourite picnic\r\nspots this one on the Baltic is the loveliest and best. As it is a\r\nthree-hours\' drive, the Man of Wrath is loud in his lamentations when\r\nthe special sort of weather comes which means, as experience has taught\r\nhim, this particular excursion. There must be deep snow, hard frost,\r\nno wind, and a cloudless sky; and when, on waking up, I see these\r\nconditions fulfilled, then it would need some very potent reason to keep\r\nme from having out a sleigh and going off. It is, I admit, a hard day\r\nfor the horses; but why have horses if they are not to take you where\r\nyou want to go to, and at the time you want to go? And why should\r\nnot horses have hard days as well as everybody else? The Man of Wrath\r\nloathes picnics, and has no eye for nature and frozen seas, and is\r\nsimply bored by a long drive through a forest that does not belong to\r\nhim; a single turnip on his own place is more admirable in his eyes than\r\nthe tallest, pinkest, straightest pine that ever reared its snow-crowned\r\nhead against the setting sunlight. Now observe the superiority of woman,\r\nwho sees that both are good, and after having gazed at the pine and been\r\nmade happy by its beauty, goes home and placidly eats the turnip. He\r\nwent once and only once to this particular place, and made us feel\r\nso small by his blast behaviour that I never invite him now. It is a\r\nbeautiful spot, endless forest stretching along the shore as far as the\r\neye can reach; and after driving through it for miles you come suddenly,\r\nat the end of an avenue of arching trees, upon the glistening, oily sea,\r\nwith the orange-coloured sails of distant fishing-smacks shilling in the\r\nsunlight. Whenever I have been there it has been windless weather, and\r\nthe silence so profound that I could hear my pulses beating. The humming\r\nof insects and the sudden scream of a jay are the only sounds in summer,\r\nand in winter the stillness is the stillness of death.\r\n\r\nEvery paradise has its serpent, however, and this one is so infested by\r\nmosquitoes during the season when picnics seem most natural, that those\r\nof my visitors who have been taken there for a treat have invariably\r\nlost their tempers, and made the quiet shores ring with their wailing\r\nand lamentations. These despicable but irritating insects don\'t seem to\r\nhave anything to do but to sit in multitudes on the sand, waiting for\r\nany prey Providence may send them; and as soon as the carriage appears\r\nthey rise up in a cloud, and rush to meet us, almost dragging us out\r\nbodily, and never leave us until we drive away again. The sudden view of\r\nthe sea from the messy, pine-covered height directly above it where we\r\npicnic; the wonderful stretch of lonely shore with the forest to the\r\nwater\'s edge; the coloured sails in the blue distance; the freshness,\r\nthe brightness, the vastness--all is lost upon the picnickers, and made\r\nworse than indifferent to them, by the perpetual necessity they are\r\nunder of fighting these horrid creatures. It is nice being the only\r\nperson who ever goes there or shows it to anybody, but if more people\r\nwent, perhaps the mosquitoes would be less lean, and hungry, and pleased\r\nto see us. It has, however, the advantage of being a suitable place to\r\nwhich to take refractory visitors when they have stayed too long, or\r\nleft my books out in the garden all night, or otherwise made their\r\npresence a burden too grievous to be borne; then one fine hot morning\r\nwhen they are all looking limp, I suddenly propose a picnic on the\r\nBaltic. I have never known this proposal fail to be greeted with\r\nexclamations of surprise and delight.\r\n\r\n"The Baltic! You never told us you were within driving distance? How\r\nheavenly to get a breath of sea air on a day like this! The very thought\r\nputs new life into one! And how delightful to see the Baltic! Oh, please\r\ntake us!" And then I take them.\r\n\r\nBut on a brilliant winter\'s day my conscience is as clear as the frosty\r\nair itself, and yesterday morning we started off in the gayest of\r\nspirits, even Minora being disposed to laugh immoderately on the least\r\nprovocation. Only our eyes were allowed to peep out from the fur and\r\nwoollen wrappings necessary to our heads if we would come back with our\r\nears and noses in the same places they were in when we started, and for\r\nthe first two miles the mirth created by each other\'s strange appearance\r\nwas uproarious,--a fact I mention merely to show what an effect dry,\r\nbright, intense cold produces on healthy bodies, and how much better\r\nit is to go out in it and enjoy it than to stay indoors and sulk. As\r\nwe passed through the neighbouring village with cracking of whip and\r\njingling of bells, heads popped up at the windows to stare, and the\r\nonly living thing in the silent, sunny street was a melancholy fowl with\r\nruffled feathers, which looked at us reproachfully, as we dashed with so\r\nmuch energy over the crackling snow.\r\n\r\n"Oh, foolish bird!" Irais called out as we passed; "you\'ll be indeed a\r\ncold fowl if you stand there motionless, and every one prefers them hot\r\nin weather like this!"\r\n\r\nAnd then we all laughed exceedingly, as though the most splendid joke\r\nhad been made, and before we had done we were out of the village and\r\nin the open country beyond, and could see my house and garden far away\r\nbehind, glittering in the sunshine; and in front of us lay the forest,\r\nwith its vistas of pines stretching away into infinity, and a drive\r\nthrough it of fourteen miles before we reached the sea. It was a\r\nhoar-frost day, and the forest was an enchanted forest leading into\r\nfairyland, and though Irais and I have been there often before, and\r\nalways thought it beautiful, yet yesterday we stood under the final arch\r\nof frosted trees, struck silent by the sheer loveliness of the place.\r\nFor a long way out the sea was frozen, and then there was a deep blue\r\nline, and a cluster of motionless orange sails; at our feet a narrow\r\nstrip of pale yellow sand; right and left the line of sparkling forest;\r\nand we ourselves standing in a world of white and diamond traceries. The\r\nstillness of an eternal Sunday lay on the place like a benediction.\r\n\r\nMinora broke the silence by remarking that Dresden was pretty, but she\r\nthought this beat it almost.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite see," said Irais in a hushed voice, as though she were in\r\na holy place, "how the two can be compared."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Dresden is more convenient, of course," replied Minora; after\r\nwhich we turned away and thought we would keep her quiet by feeding her,\r\nso we went back to the sleigh and had the horses taken out and their\r\ncloths put on, and they were walked up and down a distant glade while\r\nwe sat in the sleigh and picnicked. It is a hard day for the\r\nhorses,--nearly thirty miles there and back and no stable in the\r\nmiddle; but they are so fat and spoiled that it cannot do them much harm\r\nsometimes to taste the bitterness of life. I warmed soup in a little\r\napparatus I have for such occasions, which helped to take the chilliness\r\noff the sandwiches,--this is the only unpleasant part of a winter\r\npicnic, the clammy quality of the provisions just when you most long\r\nfor something very hot. Minora let her nose very carefully out of its\r\nwrappings, took a mouthful, and covered it up quickly again. She was\r\nnervous lest it should be frost-nipped, and truth compels me to add that\r\nher nose is not a bad nose, and might even be pretty on anybody else;\r\nbut she does not know how to carry it, and there is an art in the angle\r\nat which one\'s nose is held just as in everything else, and really noses\r\nwere intended for something besides mere blowing.\r\n\r\nIt is the most difficult thing in the world to eat sandwiches with\r\nimmense fur and woollen gloves on, and I think we ate almost as much fur\r\nas anything, and choked exceedingly during the process. Minora was angry\r\nat this, and at last pulled off her glove, but quickly put it on again.\r\n\r\n"How very unpleasant," she remarked after swallowing a large piece of\r\nfur.\r\n\r\n"It will wrap round your pipes, and keep them warm," said Irais.\r\n\r\n"Pipes!" echoed Minora, greatly disgusted by such vulgarity.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I can\'t help you," I said, as she continued to choke and\r\nsplutter; "we are all in the same case, and I don\'t know how to alter\r\nit." "There are such things as forks, I suppose," snapped Minora.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said I, crushed by the obviousness of the remedy; but\r\nof what use are forks if they are fifteen miles off? So Minora had to\r\ncontinue to eat her gloves.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had finished, the sun was already low behind the trees\r\nand the clouds beginning to flush a faint pink. The old coachman was\r\ngiven sandwiches and soup, and while he led the horses up and down\r\nwith one hand and held his lunch in the other, we packed up--or, to be\r\ncorrect, I packed, and the others looked on and gave me valuable advice.\r\n\r\nThis coachman, Peter by name, is seventy years old, and was born on the\r\nplace, and has driven its occupants for fifty years, and I am nearly as\r\nfond of him as I am of the sun-dial; indeed, I don\'t know what I should\r\ndo without him, so entirely does he appear to understand and approve of\r\nmy tastes and wishes. No drive is too long or difficult for the horses\r\nif I want to take it, no place impossible to reach if I want to go to\r\nit, no weather or roads too bad to prevent my going out if I wish to:\r\nto all my suggestions he responds with the readiest cheerfulness, and\r\nsmoothes away all objections raised by the Man of Wrath, who rewards his\r\nalacrity in doing my pleasure by speaking of him as an alter Esel. In\r\nthe summer, on fine evenings, I love to drive late and alone in the\r\nscented forests, and when I have reached a dark part stop, and sit quite\r\nstill, listening to the nightingales repeating their little tune\r\nover and over again after interludes of gurgling, or if there are no\r\nnightingales, listening to the marvellous silence, and letting its\r\nblessedness descend into my very soul. The nightingales in the forests\r\nabout here all sing the same tune, and in the same key of (E flat).\r\n\r\nI don\'t know whether all nightingales do this, or if it is peculiar\r\nto this particular spot. When they have sung it once, they clear their\r\nthroats a little, and hesitate, and then do it again, and it is the\r\nprettiest little song in the world. How could I indulge my passion for\r\nthese drives with their pauses without Peter? He is so used to them that\r\nhe stops now at the right moment without having to be told, and he is\r\nready to drive me all night if I wish it, with no sign of anything but\r\ncheerful willingness on his nice old face. The Man of Wrath deplores\r\nthese eccentric tastes, as he calls them, of mine; but has given up\r\ntrying to prevent my indulging them because, while he is deploring in\r\none part of the house, I have slipped out at a door in the other, and am\r\ngone before he can catch me, and have reached and am lost in the shadows\r\nof the forest by the time he has discovered that I am nowhere to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe brightness of Peter\'s perfections are sullied however by one spot,\r\nand that is, that as age creeps upon him, he not only cannot hold\r\nthe horses in if they don\'t want to be held in, but he goes to sleep\r\nsometimes on his box if I have him out too soon after lunch, and has\r\nupset me twice within the last year--once last winter out of a sleigh,\r\nand once this summer, when the horses shied at a bicycle, and bolted\r\ninto the ditch on one side of the chaussee (German for high road), and\r\nthe bicycle was so terrified at the horses shying that it shied too\r\ninto the ditch on the other side, and the carriage was smashed, and the\r\nbicycle was smashed, and we were all very unhappy, except Peter, who\r\nnever lost his pleasant smile, and looked so placid that my tongue clave\r\nto the roof of my mouth when I tried to make it scold him.\r\n\r\n"But I should think he ought to have been thoroughly scolded on an\r\noccasion like that," said Minora, to whom I had been telling this story\r\nas we wandered on the yellow sands while the horses were being put in\r\nthe sleigh; and she glanced nervously up at Peter, whose mild head was\r\nvisible between the bushes above us. "Shall we get home before dark?"\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\nThe sun had altogether disappeared behind the pines and only the very\r\nhighest of the little clouds were still pink; out at sea the mists\r\nwere creeping up, and the sails of the fishing-smacks had turned a dull\r\nbrown; a flight of wild geese passed across the disc of the moon with\r\nloud cacklings.\r\n\r\n"Before dark?" echoed Irais, "I should think not. It is dark now nearly\r\nin the forest, and we shall have the loveliest moonlight drive back."\r\n\r\n"But it is surely very dangerous to let a man who goes to sleep drive\r\nyou," said Minora apprehensively.\r\n\r\n"But he\'s such an old dear," I said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, no doubt," she replied tastily; "but there are wakeful old\r\ndears to be had, and on a box they are preferable."\r\n\r\nIrais laughed. "You are growing quite amusing, Miss Minora," she said.\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t on a box to-day," said I; "and I never knew him to go to sleep\r\nstanding up behind us on a sleigh." But Minora was not to be appeased,\r\nand muttered something about seeing no fun in foolhardiness, which shows\r\nhow alarmed she was, for it was rude.\r\n\r\nPeter, however, behaved beautifully on the way home, and Irais and I at\r\nleast were as happy as possible driving back, with all the glories of\r\nthe western sky flashing at us every now and then at the end of a long\r\navenue as we swiftly passed, and later on, when they had faded, myriads\r\nof stars in the narrow black strip of sky over our heads. It was\r\nbitterly cold, and Minora was silent, and not in the least inclined to\r\nlaugh with us as she had been six hours before.\r\n\r\n"Have you enjoyed yourself, Miss Minora?\' inquired Irais, as we got out\r\nof the forest on to the chaussee, and the lights of the village before\r\nours twinkled in the distance.\r\n\r\n"How many degrees do you suppose there are now?" was Minora\'s reply to\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\n"Degrees?--Of frost? Oh, dear me, are you cold," cried Irais\r\nsolicitously.\r\n\r\n"Well, it isn\'t exactly warm, is it?" said Minora sulkily; and Irais\r\npinched me. "Well, but think how much colder you would have been without\r\nall that fur you ate for lunch inside you," she said. "And what a nice\r\nchapter you will be able to write about the Baltic," said I. "Why, it is\r\npractically certain that you are the first English person who has ever\r\nbeen to just this part of it."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there some English poem," said Irais, "about being the first who\r\never burst--"\r\n\r\n"\'Into that silent sea,\'" finished Minora hastily. "You can\'t quote that\r\nwithout its context, you know."\r\n\r\n"But I wasn\'t going to," said Irais meekly; "I only paused to breathe. I\r\nmust breathe, or perhaps I might die."\r\n\r\nThe lights from my energetic friend\'s Schloss shone brightly down upon\r\nus as we passed round the base of the hill on which it stands; she is\r\nvery proud of this hill, as well she may be, seeing that it is the only\r\none in the whole district.\r\n\r\n"Do you never go there?" asked Minora, jerking her head in the direction\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes. She is a very busy woman, and I should feel I was in the way\r\nif I went often."\r\n\r\n"It would be interesting to see another North German interior," said\r\nMinora; "and I should be obliged if you would take me.\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t fall upon her suddenly with a strange girl," I protested;\r\n"and we are not at all on such intimate terms as to justify my taking\r\nall my visitors to see her."\r\n\r\n"What do you want to see another interior for?" asked Irais. "I can tell\r\nyou what it is like; and if you went nobody would speak to you, and if\r\nyou were to ask questions, and began to take notes, the good lady would\r\nstare at you in the frankest amazement, and think Elizabeth had brought\r\na young lunatic out for an airing. Everybody is not as patient as\r\nElizabeth," added Irais, anxious to pay off old scores.\r\n\r\n"I would do a great deal for you, Miss Minora," I said, "but I can\'t do\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"If we went," said Irais, "Elizabeth and I would be placed with great\r\nceremony on a sofa behind a large, polished oval table with a crochetmat\r\nin the centre--it has got a crochet-mat in the centre, hasn\'t it?" I\r\nnodded. "And you would sit on one of the four little podgy, buttony,\r\ntasselly red chairs that are ranged on the other side of the table\r\nfacing the sofa. They are red, Elizabeth?" Again I nodded. "The floor\r\nis painted yellow, and there is no carpet except a rug in front of the\r\nsofa. The paper is dark chocolate colour, almost black; that is in order\r\nthat after years of use the dirt may not show, and the room need not be\r\ndone up. Dirt is like wickedness, you see, Miss Minora--its being there\r\nnever matters; it is only when it shows so much as to be apparent to\r\neverybody that we are ashamed of it. At intervals round the high walls\r\nare chairs, and cabinets with lamps on them, and in one corner is a\r\ngreat white cold stove--or is it majolica?" she asked, turning to me.\r\n\r\n"No, it is white."\r\n\r\n"There are a great many lovely big windows, all ready to let in the air\r\nand the sun, but they are as carefully covered with brown lace curtains\r\nunder heavy stuff ones as though a whole row of houses were just\r\nopposite, with peering eyes at every window trying to look in, instead\r\nof there only being fields, and trees, and birds. No fire, no sunlight,\r\nno books, no flowers; but a consoling smell of red cabbage coming up\r\nunder the door, mixed, in due season, with soapsuds."\r\n\r\n"When did you go there?" asked Minora.\r\n\r\n"Ah, when did I go there indeed? When did I not go there? I have been\r\ncalling there all my life."\r\n\r\nMinora\'s eyes rolled doubtfully first at me then at Irais from the\r\ndepths of her head-wrappings; they are large eyes with long dark\r\neyelashes, and far be it from me to deny that each eye taken by itself\r\nis fine, but they are put in all wrong.\r\n\r\n"The only thing you would learn there," went on Irais, "would be\r\nthe significance of sofa corners in Germany. If we three went there\r\ntogether, I should be ushered into the right-hand corner of the sofa,\r\nbecause it is the place of honour, and I am the greatest stranger;\r\nElizabeth would be invited to seat herself in the left-hand corner, as\r\nnext in importance; the hostess would sit near us in an arm-chair; and\r\nyou, as a person of no importance whatever, would either be left to\r\nsit where you could, or would be put on a chair facing us, and with the\r\nentire breadth of the table between us to mark the immense social\r\ngulf that separates the married woman from the mere virgin. These sofa\r\ncorners make the drawing of nice distinctions possible in a way that\r\nnothing else could. The world might come to an end, and create less\r\nsensation in doing it, than you would, Miss Minora, if by any chance you\r\ngot into the right-hand corner of one. That you are put on a chair\r\non the other side of the table places you at once in the scale of\r\nprecedence, and exactly defines your social position, or rather your\r\ncomplete want of a social position." And Irais tilted her nose ever so\r\nlittle heavenwards.\r\n\r\n"Note it," she added, "as the heading of your next chapter."\r\n\r\n"Note what?" asked Minora impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Why,\'The Subtle Significance of Sofas\', of course," replied Irais.\r\n"If," she continued, as Minora made no reply appreciative of this\r\nsuggestion, "you were to call unexpectedly, the bad luck which pursues\r\nthe innocent would most likely make you hit on a washing-day, and the\r\ndistracted mistress of the house would keep you waiting in the cold room\r\nso long while she changed her dress, that you would begin to fear you\r\nwere to be left to perish from want and hunger; and when she did appear,\r\nwould show by the bitterness of her welcoming smile the rage that was\r\nboiling in her heart."\r\n\r\n"But what has the mistress of the house to do with washing?"\r\n\r\n"What has she to do with washing? Oh, you sweet innocent--pardon my\r\nfamiliarity, but such ignorance of country-life customs is very touching\r\nin one who is writing a book about them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have no doubt I am very ignorant," said Minora loftily.\r\n\r\n"Seasons of washing," explained Irais, "are seasons set apart by the\r\nHausfrau to be kept holy. They only occur every two or three months,\r\nand while they are going on the whole house is in an uproar, every other\r\nconsideration sacrificed, husband and children sunk into insignificance,\r\nand no one approaching, or interfering with the mistress of the house\r\nduring these days of purification, but at their peril."\r\n\r\n"You Don\'t Really Mean," Said Minora, "that You Only Wash Your Clothes\r\nFour Times A Year?\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do mean it," replied Irais.\r\n\r\n"Well, I think that is very disgusting," said Minora emphatically.\r\n\r\nIrais raised those pretty, delicate eyebrows of hers. "Then you must\r\ntake care and not marry a German," she said.\r\n\r\n"But what is the object of it?" went on Minora.\r\n\r\n"Why, to clean the linen, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, but why only at such long intervals?"\r\n\r\n"It is an outward and visible sign of vast possessions in the shape of\r\nlinen. If you were to want to have your clothes washed every week, as\r\nyou do in England, you would be put down as a person who only has just\r\nenough to last that length of time, and would be an object of general\r\ncontempt."\r\n\r\n"But I should be a clean object," cried Minora, "and my house would not\r\nbe full of accumulated dirt."\r\n\r\nWe said nothing--there was nothing to be said.\r\n\r\n"It must be a happy land, that England of yours," Irais remarked after\r\na while with a sigh--a beatific vision no doubt presenting itself to\r\nher mind of a land full of washerwomen and agile gentlemen darting at\r\ndoor-handles.\r\n\r\n"It is a clean land, at any rate," replied Minora.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to go and live in it," I said--for we were driving up to\r\nthe house, and a memory of fogs and umbrellas came into my mind as I\r\nlooked up fondly at its dear old west front, and I felt that what I\r\nwant is to live and die just here, and that there never was such a happy\r\nwoman as Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 18th.--I have been so busy ever since Irais and Minora left that\r\nI can hardly believe the spring is here, and the garden hurrying on its\r\ngreen and flowered petticoat--only its petticoat as yet, for though the\r\nunderwood is a fairyland of tender little leaves, the trees above are\r\nstill quite bare.\r\n\r\nFebruary was gone before I well knew that it had come, so deeply was\r\nI engaged in making hot-beds, and having them sown with petunias,\r\nverbenas, and nicotina affinis; while no less than thirty are dedicated\r\nsolely to vegetables, it having been borne in upon me lately that\r\nvegetables must be interesting things to grow, besides possessing solid\r\nvirtues not given to flowers, and that I might as well take the orchard\r\nand kitchen garden under my wing. So I have rushed in with all the zeal\r\nof utter inexperience, and my February evenings were spent poring over\r\ngardening books, and my days in applying the freshly absorbed wisdom.\r\nWho says that February is a dull, sad, slow month in the country? It\r\nwas of the cheerfullest, swiftest description here, and its mild days\r\nenabled me to get on beautifully with the digging and manuring, and\r\nfilled my rooms with snowdrops. The longer I live the greater is my\r\nrespect and affection for manure in all its forms, and already, though\r\nthe year is so young, a considerable portion of its pin-money has been\r\nspent on artificial manure. The Man of Wrath says he never met a young\r\nwoman who spent her money that way before; I remarked that it must be\r\nnice to have an original wife; and he retorted that the word original\r\nhardly described me, and that the word eccentric was the one required.\r\nVery well, I suppose I am eccentric, since even my husband says so; but\r\nif my eccentricities are of such a practical nature as to result later\r\nin the biggest cauliflowers and tenderest lettuce in Prussia, why then\r\nhe ought to be the first to rise up and call me blessed.\r\n\r\nI sent to England for vegetable-marrow seeds, as they are not grown\r\nhere, and people try and make boiled cucumbers take their place; but\r\nboiled cucumbers are nasty things, and I don\'t see why marrows should\r\nnot do here perfectly well. These, and primrose-roots, are the English\r\ncontributions to my garden. I brought over the roots in a tin box\r\nlast time I came from England, and am anxious to see whether they\r\nwill consent to live here. Certain it is that they don\'t exist in the\r\nFatherland, so I can only conclude the winter kills them, for surely,\r\nif such lovely things would grow, they never would have been overlooked.\r\nIrais is deeply interested in the experiment; she reads so many English\r\nbooks, and has heard so much about primroses, and they have got so mixed\r\nup in her mind with leagues, and dames, and Disraelis, that she longs\r\nto see this mysterious political flower, and has made me promise to\r\ntelegraph when it appears, and she will come over. Bur they are not\r\ngoing to do anything this year, and I only hope those cold days did\r\nnot send them off to the Paradise of flowers. I am afraid their first\r\nimpression of Germany was a chilly one.\r\n\r\nIrais writes about once a week, and inquires after the garden and\r\nthe babies, and announces her intention of coming back as soon as the\r\nnumerous relations staying with her have left,--"which they won\'t do,"\r\nshe wrote the other day, "until the first frosts nip them off, when they\r\nwill disappear like belated dahlias--double ones of course, for single\r\ndahlias are too charming to be compared to relations. I have every sort\r\nof cousin and uncle and aunt here, and here they have been ever since\r\nmy husband\'s birthday--not the same ones exactly, but I get so confused\r\nthat I never know where one ends and the other begins. My husband goes\r\noff after breakfast to look at his crops, he says, and I am left at\r\ntheir mercy. I wish I had crops to go and look at--I should be grateful\r\neven for one, and would look at it from morning till night, and quite\r\nstare it out of countenance, sooner than stay at home and have the\r\ntruth told me by enigmatic aunts. Do you know my Aunt Bertha? she,\r\nin particular, spends her time propounding obscure questions for my\r\nsolution. I get so tired and worried trying to guess the answers, which\r\nare always truths supposed to be good for me to hear. \'Why do you wear\r\nyour hair on your forehead?\' she asks,--and that sets me off wondering\r\nwhy I do wear it on my forehead, and what she wants to know for,\r\nor whether she does know and only wants to know if I will answer\r\ntruthfully. \'I am sure I don\'t know, aunt,\' I say meekly, after puzzling\r\nover it for ever so long; \'perhaps my maid knows. Shall I ring and ask\r\nher?\' And then she informs me that I wear it so to hide an ugly line she\r\nsays I have down the middle of my forehead, and that betokens a listless\r\nand discontented disposition. Well, if she knew, what did she ask me\r\nfor? Whenever I am with them they ask me riddles like that, and I\r\nsimply lead a dog\'s life. Oh, my dear, relations are like drugs,--useful\r\nsometimes, and even pleasant, if taken in small quantities and seldom,\r\nbut dreadfully pernicious on the whole, and the truly wise avoid them."\r\n\r\nFrom Minora I have only had one communication since her departure, in\r\nwhich she thanked me for her pleasant visit, and said she was sending me\r\na bottle of English embrocation to rub on my bruises after skating; that\r\nit was wonderful stuff, and she was sure I would like it; and that it\r\ncost two marks, and would I send stamps. I pondered long over this. Was\r\nit a parting hit, intended as revenge for our having laughed at her? Was\r\nshe personally interested in the sale of embrocation? Or was it merely\r\nMinora\'s idea of a graceful return for my hospitality? As for bruises,\r\nnobody who skates decently regards it as a bruise-producing exercise,\r\nand whenever there were any they were all on Minora; but she did happen\r\nto turn round once, I remember, just as I was in the act of tumbling\r\ndown for the first and only time, and her delight was but thinly\r\nveiled by her excessive solicitude and sympathy. I sent her the stamps,\r\nreceived the bottle, and resolved to let her drop out of my life; I had\r\nbeen a good Samaritan to her at the request of my friend, but the best\r\nof Samaritans resents the offer of healing oil for his own use. But why\r\nwaste a thought on Minora at Easter, the real beginning of the year in\r\ndefiance of calendars. She belongs to the winter that is past, to the\r\ndarkness that is over, and has no part or lot in the life I shall lead\r\nfor the next six months. Oh, I could dance and sing for joy that the\r\nspring is here! What a resurrection of beauty there is in my garden, and\r\nof brightest hope in my heart! The whole of this radiant Easter day\r\nI have spent out of doors, sitting at first among the windflowers and\r\ncelandines, and then, later, walking with the babies to the Hirschwald,\r\nto see what the spring had been doing there; and the afternoon was\r\nso hot that we lay a long time on the turf, blinking up through the\r\nleafless branches of the silver birches at the soft, fat little white\r\nclouds floating motionless in the blue. We had tea on the grass in the\r\nsun, and when it began to grow late, and the babies were in bed, and all\r\nthe little wind-flowers folded up for the night, I still wandered in\r\nthe green paths, my heart full of happiest gratitude. It makes one\r\nvery humble to see oneself surrounded by such a wealth of beauty and\r\nperfection anonymously lavished, and to think of the infinite meanness\r\nof our own grudging charities, and how displeased we are if they are\r\nnot promptly and properly appreciated. I do sincerely trust that the\r\nbenediction that is always awaiting me in my garden may by degrees\r\nbe more deserved, and that I may grow in grace, and patience, and\r\ncheerfulness, just like the happy flowers I so much love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Elizabeth and her German Garden, by\r\n"Elizabeth", AKA Marie Annette Beauchamp\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ELIZABETH AND HER GERMAN GARDEN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1327.txt or 1327.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/2/1327/\r\n\r\nProduced by R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
