The metropolis, and\r\neverything that appertains to it, that comes down from it, that goes up\r\ninto it, has for him an imperious fascination. Long before schooldays\r\nare over he learns to take a doleful pleasure in watching the exit of\r\nthe London train from the railway station. He stands by the hot engine\r\nand envies the very stoker. Gazing curiously into the carriages, he\r\nwonders that men and women who in a few hours will be treading streets\r\ncalled Piccadilly and the Strand can contemplate the immediate future\r\nwith so much apparent calmness; some of them even have the audacity to\r\nlook bored. He finds it difficult to keep from throwing himself in the\r\nguard\'s van as it glides past him; and not until the last coach is a\r\nspeck upon the distance does he turn away and, nodding absently to the\r\nticket-clerk, who knows him well, go home to nurse a vague ambition and\r\ndream of Town.\r\n\r\nLondon is the place where newspapers are issued, books written, and\r\nplays performed. And this youth, who now sits in an office, reads all\r\nthe newspapers. He knows exactly when a new work by a famous author\r\nshould appear, and awaits the reviews with impatience. He can tell you\r\noff-hand the names of the pieces in the bills of the twenty principal\r\nWest-end theatres, what their quality is, and how long they may be\r\nexpected to run; and on the production of a new play, the articles of\r\nthe dramatic critics provide him with sensations almost as vivid as\r\nthose of the most zealous first-nighter at the performance itself.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, perhaps by painful roads, he reaches the goal of his\r\ndesire. London accepts him--on probation; and as his strength is, so\r\nshe demeans herself. Let him be bold and resolute, and she will make\r\nan obeisance, but her heel is all too ready to crush the coward and\r\nhesitant; and her victims, once underfoot, do not often rise again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe antique four-wheeler, top-heavy with luggage, swung unsteadily\r\nround by Tattersall\'s and into Raphael Street. Richard thrust down the\r\nwindow with a sharp bang, indicative of a strange new sense of power;\r\nbut before the cab came to a standstill he had collected himself, and\r\nmanaged to alight with considerable decorum. When the door opened\r\nin answer to his second ring, a faint, sour odour escaped from the\r\nhouse, and he remembered the friendly feminine warnings which he had\r\nreceived at Bursley on the subject of London lodgings. The aspect of\r\nthe landlady, however, reassured him; she was a diminutive old woman\r\nin ridiculously short skirts, with a yellow, crinkled face, grey eyes,\r\nand a warm, benevolent smile that conquered. As she greeted Richard she\r\nblushed like a girl, and made a little old-fashioned curtsey. Richard\r\noffered his hand, and, after wiping hers on a clean apron, she took it\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n"I hope we shall get on well together, sir," she said, looking straight\r\nup into her new lodger\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we shall," answered Richard, sincerely.\r\n\r\nShe preceded him up the narrow, frowsy staircase, which was full of\r\nsurprising turns.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find these stairs a bit awkward at first," she apologised.\r\n"I\'ve often thought of getting a bit of nice carpet on them, but what\'s\r\nthe use? It would be done for in a week. Now, here\'s your room, sir,\r\nfirst floor front, with two nice French windows, you see, and a nice\r\nbalcony. Now, about tidying it of a morning, sir. If you\'ll step out\r\nfor a walk as soon as you get up, my daughter shall make the bed,\r\nand dust, and you\'ll come in and find it all nice and straight for\r\nbreakfast."\r\n\r\n"Very well," assented Richard.\r\n\r\n"That\'s how I generally arrange with my young men. I like them to have\r\ntheir breakfast in a nice tidy room, you see, sir. Now, what will you\r\nhave for tea, sir? A little nice bread and butter...."\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone Richard formally surveyed his quarters: a long,\r\nrather low room, its length cut by the two windows which were Mrs.\r\nRowbotham\'s particular pride; between the windows a table with a faded\r\ngreen cloth, and a small bed opposite; behind the door an artfully\r\nconcealed washstand; the mantelpiece, painted mustard yellow, bore\r\ndivers squat earthenware figures, and was surmounted by an oblong\r\nmirror framed in rosewood; over the mirror an illuminated text,\r\n"Trust in Jesus," and over the text an oleograph, in collision with\r\nthe ceiling, entitled, "After the Battle of Culloden." The walls were\r\ndecorated with a pattern of giant pink roses; and here and there,\r\nhiding the roses, were hung photographs of persons in their Sunday\r\nclothes, and landscapes hand-painted in oil, depicting bridges, trees,\r\nwater, and white sails in the distance. But the furnishing of the room\r\ncaused Richard no uneasiness; in a few moments he had mentally arranged\r\nhow to make the place habitable, and thenceforth he only saw what\r\nshould and would be.\r\n\r\nTea was brought in by a girl whose face proclaimed her to be Mrs.\r\nRowbotham\'s daughter. At the sight of her Richard privately winked; he\r\nhad read in books about landladies\' daughters, but this one gave the\r\nlie to books; she was young, she was beautiful, and Richard would have\r\nsworn to her innocence. With an accession of boldness which surprised\r\nhimself, he inquired her name.\r\n\r\n"Lily, sir," she said, blushing like her mother.\r\n\r\nHe cut the new, heavy bread, and poured out a cup of tea with the\r\nawkwardness of one unaccustomed to such work, and, having made space\r\non the tray, set the evening paper against the sugar basin, and began\r\nto eat and read. Outside were two piano organs, children shouting,\r\nand a man uttering some monotonous unintelligible cry. It grew dark;\r\nMrs. Rowbotham came in with a lamp and cleared the table; Richard\r\nwas looking through the window, and neither spoke. Presently he sat\r\ndown. That being his first night in London, he had determined to spend\r\nit quietly _at home_. The piano organs and the children were still\r\nstrident. A peculiar feeling of isolation momentarily overcame him, and\r\nthe noises of the street seemed to recede. Then he went to the window\r\nagain, and noticed that the children were dancing quite gracefully; it\r\noccurred to him that they might be ballet children. He picked up the\r\npaper and examined the theatrical advertisements, at first idly, but\r\nafterwards in detail.\r\n\r\nWith a long sigh, he took his hat and stick, and went very slowly\r\ndownstairs. Mrs. Rowbotham heard him fumbling with the catch of the\r\nfront door.\r\n\r\n"Are you going out, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Only just for a walk," said Richard, nonchalantly.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I\'d better give you a latch-key?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks."\r\n\r\nAnother moment and he was in the delicious streets, going east.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough he had visited London but once before, and then only for a few\r\nhours, he was not unfamiliar with the topography of the town, having\r\nfrequently studied it in maps and an old copy of Kelly\'s directory.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly up Park Side and through Piccadilly, picking out as\r\nhe passed them the French Embassy, Hyde Park Corner, Apsley House,\r\nPark Lane, and Devonshire House. As he drank in the mingled glare and\r\nglamour of Piccadilly by night,--the remote stars, the high sombre\r\ntrees, the vast, dazzling interiors of clubs, the sinuous, flickering\r\nlines of traffic, the radiant faces of women framed in hansoms,--he\r\nlaughed the laugh of luxurious contemplation, acutely happy. At last,\r\nat last, he had come into his inheritance. London accepted him. He\r\nwas hers; she his; and nothing should part them. Starvation in London\r\nwould itself be bliss. But he had no intention of starving! Filled with\r\ngreat purposes, he straightened his back, and just then a morsel of mud\r\nthrown up from a bus-wheel splashed warm and gritty on his cheek. He\r\nwiped it off caressingly, with a smile.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was Saturday night, and most of the shops were closed,\r\nan establishment where watches and trinkets of "Anglo-Spanish" gold,\r\nsuperb in appearance and pillowed on green plush, were retailed at\r\nalluring prices, still threw a brilliant light on the pavement, and\r\nRichard crossed the road to inspect its wares. He turned away, but\r\nretraced his steps and entered the shop. An assistant politely inquired\r\nhis wishes.\r\n\r\n"I want one of those hunters you have in the window at 29/6," said\r\nRichard, with a gruffness which must have been involuntary.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Here is one. We guarantee that the works are equal to the\r\nfinest English lever."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take it." He put down the money.\r\n\r\n"Thank you. Can I show you anything else?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, thanks," still more gruffly.\r\n\r\n"We have some excellent chains...."\r\n\r\n"Nothing else, thanks." And he walked out, putting his purchase in his\r\npocket. A perfectly reliable gold watch, which he had worn for years,\r\nalready lay there.\r\n\r\nAt Piccadilly Circus he loitered, and then crossed over and went\r\nalong Coventry Street to Leicester Square. The immense fa\xe7ade of the\r\nOttoman Theatre of Varieties, with its rows of illuminated windows and\r\ncrescent moons set against the sky, rose before him, and the glory of\r\nit was intoxicating. It is not too much to say that the Ottoman held a\r\nstronger fascination for Richard than any other place in London. The\r\nBritish Museum, Fleet Street, and the Lyceum were magic names, but\r\nmore magical than either was the name of the Ottoman. The Ottoman, on\r\nthe rare occasions when it happened to be mentioned in Bursley, was a\r\nsynonym for all the glittering vices of the metropolis. It stank in\r\nthe nostrils of the London delegates who came down to speak at the\r\nannual meetings of the local Society for the Suppression of Vice. But\r\nhow often had Richard, somnolent in chapel, mitigated the rigours of a\r\nlong sermon by dreaming of an Ottoman ballet,--one of those voluptuous\r\nspectacles, all legs and white arms, which from time to time were\r\ndescribed so ornately in the London daily papers.\r\n\r\nThe brass-barred swinging doors of the Grand Circle entrance were\r\nsimultaneously opened for him by two human automata dressed exactly\r\nalike in long semi-military coats, a very tall man and a stunted boy.\r\nHe advanced with what air of custom he could command, and after taking\r\na ticket and traversing a heavily decorated corridor encountered\r\nanother pair of swinging doors; they opened, and a girl passed out,\r\nfollowed by a man who was talking to her vehemently in French. At\r\nthe same moment a gust of distant music struck Richard\'s ear. As he\r\nclimbed a broad, thick-piled flight of steps, the music became louder,\r\nand a clapping of hands could be heard. At the top of the steps hung\r\na curtain of blue velvet; he pushed aside its stiff, heavy folds with\r\ndifficulty, and entered the auditorium.\r\n\r\nThe smoke of a thousand cigarettes enveloped the furthest parts of\r\nthe great interior in a thin bluish haze, which was dissipated as\r\nit reached the domed ceiling in the rays of a crystal chandelier.\r\nFar in front and a little below the level of the circle lay a line\r\nof footlights broken by the silhouette of the conductor\'s head. A\r\ndiminutive, solitary figure in red and yellow stood in the centre\r\nof the huge stage; it was kissing its hands to the audience with a\r\nmincing, operatic gesture; presently it tripped off backwards, stopping\r\nat every third step to bow; the applause ceased, and the curtain fell\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nThe broad, semicircular promenade which flanked the seats of the grand\r\ncircle was filled with a well-dressed, well-fed crowd. The men talked\r\nand laughed, for the most part, in little knots, while in and out,\r\nsteering their way easily and rapidly among these groups, moved the\r\nwomen: some with rouged cheeks, greasy vermilion lips, and enormous\r\nliquid eyes; others whose faces were innocent of cosmetics and showed\r\npale under the electric light; but all with a peculiar, exaggerated\r\nswing of the body from the hips, and all surreptitiously regarding\r\nthemselves in the mirrors which abounded on every glowing wall.\r\n\r\nRichard stood aloof against a pillar. Near him were two men in evening\r\ndress conversing in tones which just rose above the general murmur of\r\ntalk and the high, penetrating tinkle of glass from the bar behind the\r\npromenade.\r\n\r\n"And what did she say then?" one of the pair asked smilingly. Richard\r\nstrained his ear to listen.\r\n\r\n"Well, _she_ told _me_," the other said, speaking with a dreamy drawl,\r\nwhile fingering his watch-chain absently and gazing down at the large\r\ndiamond in his shirt,--"_she_ told _me_ that she said she\'d do for him\r\nif he didn\'t fork out. But I don\'t believe her. You know, of course....\r\nThere\'s Lottie...."\r\n\r\nThe band suddenly began to play, and after a few crashing bars the\r\ncurtain went up for the ballet. The rich _coup d\'oeil_ which presented\r\nitself provoked a burst of clapping from the floor of the house and the\r\nupper tiers, but to Richard\'s surprise no one in his proximity seemed\r\nto exhibit any interest in the entertainment. The two men still talked\r\nwith their backs to the stage, the women continued to find a pathway\r\nbetween the groups, and from within the bar came the unabated murmur of\r\nvoices and tinkle of glass.\r\n\r\nRichard never took his dazed eyes from the stage. The moving pageant\r\nunrolled itself before him like a vision, rousing new sensations,\r\ntremors of strange desires. He was under a spell, and when at last the\r\ncurtain descended to the monotonous roll of drums, he awoke to the fact\r\nthat several people were watching him curiously. Blushing slightly,\r\nhe went to a far corner of the promenade. At one of the little tables\r\na woman sat alone. She held her head at an angle, and her laughing,\r\nlustrous eyes gleamed invitingly at Richard. Without quite intending to\r\ndo so he hesitated in front of her, and she twittered a phrase ending\r\nin _ch\xe9ri_.\r\n\r\nHe abruptly turned away. He would have been very glad to remain and say\r\nsomething clever, but his tongue refused its office, and his legs moved\r\nof themselves.\r\n\r\nAt midnight he found himself in Piccadilly Circus, unwilling to go\r\nhome. He strolled leisurely back to Leicester Square. The front of the\r\nOttoman was in darkness, and the square almost deserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe walked home to Raphael Street. The house was dead, except for a\r\npale light in his own room. At the top of the bare, creaking stairs he\r\nfumbled a moment for the handle of his door, and the regular sound of\r\ntwo distinct snores descended from an upper storey. He closed the door\r\nsoftly, locked it, and glanced round the room with some eagerness. The\r\nsmell of the expiring lamp compelled him to unlatch both windows. He\r\nextinguished the lamp, and after lighting a couple of candles on the\r\nmantelpiece drew a chair to the fireplace and sat down to munch an\r\napple. The thought occurred to him: "This is my home--for how long?"\r\n\r\nAnd then:\r\n\r\n"Why the dickens didn\'t I say something to that girl?"\r\n\r\nBetween the candles on the mantelpiece was a photograph of his sister,\r\nwhich he had placed there before going out. He looked at it with a half\r\nsmile, and murmured audibly several times:\r\n\r\n"Why the dickens didn\'t I say something to that girl, with her _ch\xe9ri_?"\r\n\r\nThe woman of the photograph seemed to be between thirty and forty years\r\nof age. She was fair, with a mild, serious face, and much wavy hair.\r\nThe forehead was broad and smooth and white, the cheek-bones prominent,\r\nand the mouth somewhat large. The eyes were a very light grey; they\r\nmet the gaze of the spectator with a curious timid defiance, as if to\r\nsay, "I am weak, but I can at least fight till I fall." Underneath the\r\neyes--the portrait was the work of an amateur, and consequently had not\r\nbeen robbed of all texture by retouching--a few crowsfeet could be seen.\r\n\r\nAs far back as Richard\'s memory went, he and Mary had lived together\r\nand alone in the small Red House which lay half a mile out of Bursley,\r\ntowards Turnhill, on the Manchester road. At one time it had been\r\nrurally situated, creeping plants had clothed its red walls, and the\r\nbare patch behind it had been a garden; but the gradual development\r\nof a coal-producing district had covered the fields with smooth,\r\nmountainous heaps of grey refuse, and stunted or killed every tree\r\nin the neighbourhood. The house was undermined, and in spite of iron\r\nclamps had lost most of its rectangles, while the rent had dropped to\r\nfifteen pounds a year.\r\n\r\nMary was very much older than her brother, and she had always appeared\r\nto him exactly the mature woman of the photograph. Of his parents he\r\nknew nothing except what Mary had told him, which was little and vague,\r\nfor she watchfully kept the subject at a distance.\r\n\r\nShe had supported herself and Richard in comfort by a medley of\r\nvocations, teaching the piano, collecting rents, and practising the\r\nart of millinery. They had few friends. The social circles of Bursley\r\nwere centred in its churches and chapels; and though Mary attended\r\nthe Wesleyan sanctuary with some regularity, she took small interest\r\nin prayer-meetings, class-meetings, bazaars, and all the other minor\r\nreligious activities, thus neglecting opportunities for intercourse\r\nwhich might have proved agreeable. She had sent Richard to the\r\nSunday-school; but when, at the age of fourteen, he protested that\r\nSunday-school was "awful rot," she answered calmly, "Don\'t go, then;"\r\nand from that day his place in class was empty. Soon afterwards the\r\nboy cautiously insinuated that chapel belonged to the same category as\r\nSunday-school, but the hint failed of its effect.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the town called sometimes, generally upon business, and\r\ntook afternoon tea. Once the vicar\'s wife, who wished to obtain musical\r\ntuition for her three youngest daughters at a nominal fee, came in and\r\nfound Richard at a book on the hearthrug.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said she. "Just like his father, is he not, Miss Larch?" Mary\r\nmade no reply.\r\n\r\nThe house was full of books. Richard knew them all well by sight, but\r\nuntil he was sixteen he read only a select handful of volumes which had\r\nstood the test of years. Often he idly speculated as to the contents of\r\nsome of the others,--"Horatii Opera," for instance: had that anything\r\nto do with theatres?--yet for some curious reason, which when he grew\r\nolder he sought for in vain, he never troubled himself to look into\r\nthem. Mary read a good deal, chiefly books and magazines fetched for\r\nher by Richard from the Free Library.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about seventeen, a change came. He was aware dimly, and as\r\nif by instinct, that his sister\'s life in the early days had not been\r\nwithout its romance. Certainly there was something hidden between her\r\nand William Vernon, the science master at the Institute, for they were\r\ninvariably at great pains to avoid each other. He sometimes wondered\r\nwhether Mr. Vernon was connected in any way with the melancholy which\r\nwas never, even in her brightest moments, wholly absent from Mary\'s\r\ndemeanour. One Sunday night--Richard had been keeping house--Mary,\r\ncoming in late from chapel, threw his arms round his neck as he opened\r\nthe door, and, dragging down his face to hers, kissed him hysterically\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\n"Dicky, Dick," she whispered, laughing and crying at the same time,\r\n"something\'s happened. I\'m almost an old woman, but something\'s\r\nhappened!"\r\n\r\n"I know," said Richard, retreating hurriedly from her embrace. "You\'re\r\ngoing to marry Mr. Vernon."\r\n\r\n"But how could you tell?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I just guessed."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mind, Dick, do you?"\r\n\r\n"I! Mind!" Afraid lest his feelings should appear too plainly, he asked\r\nabruptly for supper.\r\n\r\nMary gave up her various callings, the wedding took place, and William\r\nVernon came to live with them. It was then that Richard began to read\r\nmore widely, and to form a definite project of going to London.\r\n\r\nHe could not fail to respect and like William. The life of the married\r\npair seemed to him idyllic; the tender, furtive manifestations\r\nof affection which were constantly passing between Mary and her\r\nsedate, middle-aged husband touched him deeply, and at the thought\r\nof the fifteen irretrievable years during which some ridiculous\r\nmisunderstanding had separated this loving couple, his eyes were\r\nnot quite as dry as a youth could wish. But with it all he was\r\nuncomfortable. He felt himself an intruder upon holy privacies; if\r\nat meal-times husband and wife clasped hands round the corner of\r\nthe table, he looked at his plate; if they smiled happily upon no\r\ndiscoverable provocation, he pretended not to notice the fact. They\r\ndid not need him. Their hearts were full of kindness for every living\r\nthing, but unconsciously they stood aloof. He was driven in upon\r\nhimself, and spent much of his time either in solitary walking or\r\nhidden in an apartment called the study.\r\n\r\nHe ordered magazines whose very names Mr. Holt, the principal\r\nbookseller in Bursley, was unfamiliar with, and after the magazines\r\ncame books of verse and novels enclosed in covers of mystic design, and\r\nprinted in a style which Mr. Holt, though secretly impressed, set down\r\nas eccentric. Mr. Holt\'s shop performed the functions of a club for\r\nthe dignitaries of the town; and since he took care that this esoteric\r\nliterature was well displayed on the counter until called for, the\r\nyoung man\'s fame as _a great reader_ soon spread, and Richard began to\r\nsee that he was regarded as a curiosity of which Bursley need not be\r\nashamed. His self-esteem, already fostered into lustiness by a number\r\nof facile school successes, became more marked, although he was wise\r\nenough to keep a great deal of it to himself.\r\n\r\nOne evening, after Mary and her husband had been talking quietly some\r\nwhile, Richard came into the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any supper," he said, "I\'m going for a bit of a walk."\r\n\r\n"Shall we tell him?" Mary asked, smiling, after he had left the room.\r\n\r\n"Please yourself," said William, also smiling.\r\n\r\n"He talks a great deal about going to London. I hope he won\'t go\r\ntill--after April; I think it would upset me."\r\n\r\n"You need not trouble, I think, my dear," William answered. "He talks\r\nabout it, but he isn\'t gone yet."\r\n\r\nMr. Vernon was not quite pleased with Richard. He had obtained for\r\nhim--being connected with the best people in the town--a position as\r\nshorthand and general clerk in a solicitor\'s office, and had learnt\r\nprivately that though the youth was smart enough, he was scarcely\r\nmaking that progress which might have been expected. He lacked\r\n"application." William attributed this shortcoming to the excessive\r\nreading of verse and obscure novels.\r\n\r\nApril came, and, as Mr. Vernon had foretold, Richard still remained\r\nin Bursley. But the older man was now too deeply absorbed in another\r\nmatter to interest himself at all in Richard\'s movements,--a matter in\r\nwhich Richard himself exhibited a shy concern. Hour followed anxious\r\nhour, and at last was heard the faint, fretful cry of a child in the\r\nnight. Then stillness. All that Richard ever saw was a coffin, and in\r\nit a dead child at a dead woman\'s feet.\r\n\r\nFifteen months later he was in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Curpet, of the firm of Curpet and Smythe, whose name was painted in\r\nblack and white on the dark green door, had told him that the office\r\nhours were from nine-thirty to six. The clock of the Law Courts was\r\nstriking a quarter to ten. He hesitated a moment, and then seized the\r\nhandle; but the door was fast, and he descended the two double flights\r\nof iron stairs into the quadrangle.\r\n\r\nNew Serjeant\'s Court was a large modern building of very red brick\r\nwith terra-cotta facings, eight storeys high; but in spite of its\r\nfaults of colour and its excessive height, ample wall spaces and\r\ntemperate ornamentation gave it a dignity and comeliness sufficient\r\nto distinguish it from other buildings in the locality. In the centre\r\nof the court was an oval patch of brown earth, with a few trees whose\r\npale-leaved tops, struggling towards sunlight, reached to the middle of\r\nthe third storey. Round this plantation ran an immaculate roadway of\r\nwooden blocks, flanked by an equally immaculate asphalt footpath. The\r\ncourt possessed its own private lamp-posts, and these were wrought of\r\niron in an antique design.\r\n\r\nMen and boys, grave and unconsciously oppressed by the burden of the\r\ncoming day, were continually appearing out of the gloom of the long\r\ntunnelled entrance and vanishing into one or other of the twelve\r\ndoorways. Presently a carriage and pair drove in, and stopped opposite\r\nRichard. A big man of about fifty, with a sagacious red and blue face,\r\njumped alertly out, followed by an attentive clerk carrying a blue\r\nsack. It seemed to Richard that he knew the features of the big man\r\nfrom portraits, and, following the pair up the staircase of No. 2, he\r\ndiscovered from the legend on the door through which they disappeared\r\nthat he had been in the presence of Her Majesty\'s Attorney-General.\r\nSimultaneously with a misgiving as to his ability to reach the standard\r\nof clerical ability doubtless required by Messrs. Curpet and Smythe,\r\nwho did business cheek by jowl with an attorney-general and probably\r\nemployed him, came an elevation of spirit as he darkly guessed what\r\nnone can realise completely, that a man\'s future lies on his own knees,\r\nand on the knees of no gods whatsoever.\r\n\r\nHe continued his way upstairs, but Messrs. Curpet and Smythe\'s portal\r\nwas still locked. Looking down the well, he espied a boy crawling\r\nreluctantly and laboriously upward, with a key in his hand which\r\nhe dragged across the bannisters. In course of time the boy reached\r\nMessrs. Curpet and Smythe\'s door, and opening it stepped neatly over a\r\npile of letters which lay immediately within. Richard followed him.\r\n\r\n"Oh! My name\'s Larch," said Richard, as if it had just occurred to him\r\nthat the boy might be interested in the fact. "Do you know which is my\r\nroom?"\r\n\r\nThe boy conducted him along a dark passage with green doors on\r\neither side, to a room at the end. It was furnished mainly with\r\ntwo writing-tables and two armchairs; in one corner was a disused\r\ncopying-press, in another an immense pile of reporters\' note-books; on\r\nthe mantelpiece, a tumbler, a duster, and a broken desk lamp.\r\n\r\n"That\'s your seat," said the boy, pointing to the larger table, and\r\ndisappeared. Richard disposed of his coat and hat and sat down, trying\r\nto feel at ease and not succeeding.\r\n\r\nAt five minutes past ten a youth entered with the "Times" under his\r\narm. Richard waited for him to speak, but he merely stared and took off\r\nhis overcoat. Then he said,--\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got my hook. If you don\'t mind I\'ll put your things on this\r\nother one."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," assented Richard.\r\n\r\nThe youth spread his back luxuriously to the empty fireplace and opened\r\nthe "Times," when another and smaller boy put his head in at the door.\r\n\r\n"Jenkins, Mr. Alder wants the \'Times.\'"\r\n\r\nThe youth silently handed over the advertisement pages which were lying\r\non the table. In a minute the boy returned.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Alder says he wants the inside of the \'Times.\'"\r\n\r\n"Tell Mr. Alder to go to hell, with my compliments." The boy hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Go on, now," Jenkins insisted. The boy hung on the door-handle,\r\nsmiling dubiously, and then went out.\r\n\r\n"Here, wait a minute!" Jenkins called him back. "Perhaps you\'d better\r\ngive it him. Take the damn thing away."\r\n\r\nA sound of hurried footsteps in the next room was succeeded by an\r\nimperious call for Jenkins, at which Jenkins slipped nimbly into his\r\nchair and untied a bundle of papers.\r\n\r\n"Jenkins!" the call came again, with a touch of irritation in it, but\r\nJenkins did not move. The door was thrust open.\r\n\r\n"Oh! You are there, Jenkins. Just come in and take a letter down." The\r\ntones were quite placid.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Smythe."\r\n\r\n"I never take any notice of Smythe\'s calls," said Jenkins, when he\r\nreturned. "If he wants me, he must either ring or fetch me. If I once\r\nbegan it, I should be running in and out of his room all day, and I\'ve\r\nquite enough to do without that."\r\n\r\n"Fidgety, eh?" Richard suggested.\r\n\r\n"Fidgety\'s no word for it, _I_ tell you. Alder--that\'s the manager, you\r\nknow--said only yesterday that he has less trouble with forty Chancery\r\nactions of Curpet\'s than with one county-court case of Smythe\'s. I know\r\nI\'d a jolly sight sooner write forty of Curpet\'s letters than ten of\r\nSmythe\'s. I wish I\'d got your place, and you\'d got mine. I suppose you\r\ncan write shorthand rather fast."\r\n\r\n"Middling," said Richard. "About 120."\r\n\r\n"Oh! We had a man once who could do 150, but he\'d been a newspaper\r\nreporter. I do a bit over a hundred, if I\'ve not had much to drink\r\novernight. Let\'s see, they\'re giving you twenty-five bob, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\nRichard nodded.\r\n\r\n"The man before you had thirty-five, and he couldn\'t spell worth a\r\nbrass button. I only get fifteen, although I\'ve been here seven years.\r\nA damn shame I call it! But Curpet\'s beastly near. If he\'d give some\r\nother people less, and me a bit more...."\r\n\r\n"Who are \'some other people\'?" asked Richard, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s old Aked. He sits in the outer office--you won\'t have\r\nseen him because he doesn\'t generally come till eleven. They give him a\r\npound a week, just for doing a bit of engrossing when he feels inclined\r\nto engross, and for being idle when he feels inclined to be idle. He\'s\r\na broken-down something or other,--used to be clerk to Curpet\'s father.\r\nHe has some dibs of his own, and this just finds him amusement. I bet\r\nhe doesn\'t do fifty folios a week. And he\'s got the devil\'s own temper."\r\n\r\nJenkins was proceeding to describe other members of the staff when the\r\nentry of Mr. Curpet himself put an end to the recital. Mr. Curpet was a\r\nsmall man, with a round face and a neatly trimmed beard.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Larch. If you\'ll kindly come into my room, I\'ll dictate\r\nmy letters. Good morning, Jenkins." He smiled and withdrew, leaving\r\nRichard excessively surprised at his suave courtesy.\r\n\r\nIn his own room Mr. Curpet sat before a pile of letters, and motioned\r\nRichard to a side table.\r\n\r\n"You will tell me if I go too fast," he said, and began to dictate\r\nregularly, with scarcely a pause. The pile of letters gradually\r\ndisappeared into a basket. Before half a dozen letters were done\r\nRichard comprehended that he had become part of a business machine of\r\nfar greater magnitude than anything to which he had been accustomed\r\nin Bursley. This little man with the round face dealt impassively\r\nwith tens of thousands of pounds; he mortgaged whole streets, bullied\r\nrailway companies, and wrote familiarly to lords. In the middle of one\r\nlong letter, a man came panting in, whom Richard at once took for Mr.\r\nAlder, the Chancery manager. His rather battered silk hat was at the\r\nback of his head, and he looked distressed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to say we\'ve lost that summons in Rice _v._ The L. R.\r\nRailway."\r\n\r\n"Really!" said Mr. Curpet. "Better appeal, and brief a leader, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t appeal, Mr. Curpet."\r\n\r\n"Well, we must make the best of it. Telegraph to the country. I\'ll\r\nwrite and keep them calm. It\'s a pity they were so sure. Rice will have\r\nto economise for a year or two. What was my last word, Larch?" The\r\ndictation proceeded.\r\n\r\nOne hour was allowed for lunch, and Richard spent the first moiety\r\nof it in viewing the ambrosial exteriors of Strand restaurants. With\r\nthe exception of the coffee-house at Bursley, he had never been in\r\na restaurant in his life, and he was timid of entering any of those\r\nsumptuous establishments whose swinging doors gave glimpses of richly\r\ndecorated ceilings, gleaming tablecloths, and men in silk hats greedily\r\nconsuming dishes placed before them by obsequious waiters.\r\n\r\nAt last, without quite knowing how he got there, he sat in a long,\r\nlow apartment, papered like an attic bedroom, and odorous of tea and\r\ncake. The place was crowded with young men and women indifferently\r\nwell-dressed, who bent over uncomfortably small oblong marble-topped\r\ntables. An increasing clatter of crockery filled the air. Waitresses,\r\nwith pale, vacant faces, dressed in dingy black with white aprons,\r\nmoved about with difficulty at varying rates of speed, but none of\r\nthem seemed to betray an interest in Richard. Behind the counter, on\r\nwhich stood great polished urns emitting clouds of steam, were several\r\nwomen whose superior rank in the restaurant was denoted by a black\r\napron, and after five minutes had elapsed Richard observed one of these\r\ndamsels pointing out himself to a waitress, who approached and listened\r\ncondescendingly to his order.\r\n\r\nA thin man, rather more than middle-aged, with a grey beard and\r\nslightly red nose, entered and sat down opposite to Richard. Without\r\npreface he began, speaking rather fast and with an expressive vivacity\r\nrarely met with in the ageing,--\r\n\r\n"Well, my young friend, how do you like your new place?"\r\n\r\nRichard stared at him.\r\n\r\n"Are you Mr. Aked?"\r\n\r\n"The same. I suppose Master Jenkins has made you acquainted with all my\r\npeculiarities of temper and temperament.--Glass of milk, roll, and two\r\npats of butter--and, I say, my girl, try not to keep me waiting as long\r\nas you did yesterday." There was a bright smile on his face, which the\r\nwaitress unwillingly returned.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know," he went on, looking at Richard\'s plate,--"don\'t you\r\nknow that tea and ham together are frightfully indigestible?"\r\n\r\n"I never have indigestion."\r\n\r\n"No matter. You soon will have if you eat tea and ham together. A young\r\nman should guard his digestion like his honour. Sounds funny, doesn\'t\r\nit? But it\'s right. An impaired digestive apparatus has ruined many a\r\ncareer. It ruined mine. You see before you, sir, what might have been\r\nan author of repute, but for a wayward stomach."\r\n\r\n"You write?" Richard asked, interested at once, but afraid lest Mr.\r\nAked might be cumbrously joking.\r\n\r\n"I used to." The old man spoke with proud self-consciousness.\r\n\r\n"Have you written a book?"\r\n\r\n"Not a book. But I\'ve contributed to all manner of magazines and\r\nnewspapers."\r\n\r\n"What magazines?"\r\n\r\n"Well, let me see--it\'s so long ago. I\'ve written for \'Cornhill.\' I\r\nwrote for \'Cornhill\' when Thackeray edited it. I spoke to Carlyle once."\r\n\r\n"You did?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Carlyle said to me--Carlyle said to me--Carlyle said--" Mr.\r\nAked\'s voice dwindled to an inarticulate murmur, and, suddenly ignoring\r\nRichard\'s presence, he pulled a book from his pocket and began to\r\nfinger the leaves. It was a French novel, "La Vie de Boh\xe8me." His face\r\nhad lost all its mobile expressiveness.\r\n\r\nA little alarmed by such eccentricity, and not quite sure that this\r\nassociate of Carlyle was perfectly sane, Richard sat silent, waiting\r\nfor events. Mr. Aked was clearly accustomed to reading while he ate;\r\nhe could even drink with his eyes on the book. At length he pushed his\r\nplates away from him, and closed the novel with a snap.\r\n\r\n"I see you\'re from the country, Larch," he said, as if there had been\r\nno lapse in the conversation. "Now, why in God\'s name did you leave the\r\ncountry? Aren\'t there enough people in London?"\r\n\r\n"Because _I_ wanted to be an author," answered Richard, with more\r\nassurance than veracity, though he spoke in good faith. The fact was\r\nthat his aspirations, hitherto so vague as to elude analysis, seemed\r\nwithin the last few minutes mysteriously to have assumed definite form.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a young fool, then."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve an excellent digestion."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t have it if you begin to write. Take my word, you\'re a young\r\nfool. You don\'t know what you\'re going in for, my little friend."\r\n\r\n"Was Murger a fool?" Richard said clumsily, determined to exhibit an\r\nacquaintance with "La Vie de Boh\xe8me."\r\n\r\n"Ha! We read French, do we?"\r\n\r\nRichard blushed. The old man got up.\r\n\r\n"Come along," he said peevishly. "Let\'s get out of this hole."\r\n\r\nAt the pay-desk, waiting for change, he spoke to the cashier, a thin\r\ngirl with reddish-brown hair, who coughed,--\r\n\r\n"Did you try those lozenges?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, thanks. They _taste_ nice."\r\n\r\n"Beautiful day."\r\n\r\n"Yes; my word, isn\'t it!"\r\n\r\nThey walked back to the office in absolute silence; but just as they\r\nwere going in, Mr. Aked stopped, and took Richard by the coat.\r\n\r\n"Have you anything special to do next Thursday night?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Richard.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll take you to a little French restaurant in Soho, and we\'ll\r\nhave dinner. Half a crown. Can you afford?"\r\n\r\nRichard nodded.\r\n\r\n"And, I say, bring along some of your manuscripts, and I\'ll flay them\r\nalive for you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nAn inconstant, unrefreshing breeze, sluggish with accumulated impurity,\r\nstirred the curtains, and every urban sound--high-pitched voices of\r\nchildren playing, roll of wheels and rhythmic trot of horses, shouts\r\nof newsboys and querulous barking of dogs--came through the open\r\nwindows touched with a certain languorous quality that suggested a\r\ncity fatigued, a city yearning for the moist recesses of woods, the\r\ndisinfectant breath of mountain tops, and the cleansing sea.\r\n\r\nOn the little table between the windows lay pen, ink, and paper.\r\nRichard sat down to be an author. Since his conversation with Mr.\r\nAked of the day before he had lived in the full glow of an impulse\r\nto write. He discerned, or thought he discerned, in the fact that he\r\npossessed the literary gift, a key to his recent life. It explained,\r\nto be particular, the passion for reading which had overtaken him at\r\nseventeen, and his desire to come to London, the natural home of the\r\nauthor. Certainly it was strange that hitherto he had devoted very\r\nlittle serious thought to the subject of writing, but happily there\r\nwere in existence sundry stray verses and prose fragments written at\r\nBursley, and it contented him to recognise in these the first tremulous\r\nstirrings of a late-born ambition.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous evening he had busied himself in deciding upon a\r\ntopic. In a morning paper he had read an article entitled "An Island of\r\nSleep," descriptive of Sark; it occurred to him that a similar essay\r\nupon Lichfield, the comatose cathedral city which lay about thirty\r\nmiles from Bursley, might suit a monthly magazine. He knew Lichfield\r\nwell; he had been accustomed to visit it from childhood; he loved it.\r\nAs a theme full of picturesque opportunities it had quickened his\r\nimagination, until his brain seemed to surge with vague but beautiful\r\nfancies. In the night his sleep had been broken, and several new ideas\r\nhad suggested themselves. And now, after a day of excited anticipation,\r\nthe moment for composition had arrived.\r\n\r\nAs he dipped his pen in the ink a sudden apprehension of failure\r\nsurprised him. He dismissed it, and wrote in a bold hand, rather\r\ncarefully,--\r\n\r\n MEMORIES OF A CITY OF SLEEP.\r\n\r\nThat was surely an excellent title. He proceeded:--\r\n\r\n _On the old stone bridge, beneath which the clear, smooth waters of\r\n the river have crept at the same pace for centuries, stands a little\r\n child, alone. It is early morning, and the clock of the time-stained\r\n cathedral which lifts its noble gothic towers scarce a hundred yards\r\n away, strikes five, to the accompaniment of an unseen lark overhead._\r\n\r\nHe sat back to excogitate the next sentence, staring around the room\r\nas if he expected to find the words written on the wall. One of the\r\ngilt-framed photographs was slightly askew; he left his chair to put\r\nit straight; several other pictures seemed to need adjustment, and\r\nhe levelled them all with scrupulous precision. The ornaments on the\r\nmantelpiece were not evenly balanced; these he rearranged entirely.\r\nThen, having first smoothed out a crease in the bedcover, he sat down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut most of the beautiful ideas which he had persuaded himself\r\nwere firmly within his grasp, now eluded him, or tardily presented\r\nthemselves in a form so obscure as to be valueless, and the useful few\r\nthat remained defied all attempts to bring them into order. Dashed by\r\nhis own impotence, he sought out the article on Sark, and examined it\r\nafresh. Certain weekly organs of literature had educated him to sneer\r\nat the journalism of the daily press, but it appeared that the man who\r\nwrote "An Island of Sleep" was at least capable of expressing himself\r\nwith clearness and fluency, and possessed the skill to pass naturally\r\nfrom one aspect of his subject to another. It seemed simple enough....\r\n\r\nHe went to the window.\r\n\r\nThe sky was a delicate amber, and Richard watched it change to rose,\r\nand from rose to light blue. The gas-lamps glared out in quick\r\nsuccession; some one lowered the blind of a window opposite his own,\r\nand presently a woman\'s profile was silhouetted against it for a\r\nmoment, and then vanished. A melody came from the public house, sung\r\nin a raucous baritone to the thrumming of a guitar; the cries of the\r\nplaying children had now ceased.\r\n\r\nSuddenly turning into the room, he was astonished to find it almost in\r\ndarkness; he could distinguish only the whiteness of the papers on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nHe was not in the mood for writing to-night. Some men wrote best in\r\nthe evening, others in the morning. Probably he belonged to the latter\r\nclass. Be that as it might, he would rise at six the next morning and\r\nmake a new beginning. "It\'s only a question of practice, of course," he\r\nsaid, half aloud, repressing a troublesome dubiety. He would take a\r\nshort walk, and go early to bed. Gradually his self-confidence returned.\r\n\r\nAs he closed the front door there was a rustle of silks and a transient\r\nodour of violets; a woman had gone by. She turned slightly at the sound\r\nof the door, and Richard had a glimpse of a young and pretty face\r\nunder a spreading hat, a full, ripe bust whose alluring contours were\r\nperfectly disclosed by a tight-fitting bodice, and two small white\r\nhands, in one a dangling pair of gloves, in the other an umbrella. He\r\npassed her, and waited at the corner by Tattersall\'s till she overtook\r\nhim again. Now she stood on the kerb within six feet of him, humming an\r\nair and smiling to herself. Up went the umbrella to signal for a hansom.\r\n\r\n"The Ottoman," Richard heard her say across the roof of the cab, the\r\ndriver leaning forward with his hand to his ear. What a child\'s voice\r\nit seemed, lisping and artless!\r\n\r\nThe cabman winked at Richard, and gently flicked his horse. In a moment\r\nthe hansom was two dwindling specks of red in a shifting multitude of\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nAn hour later he saw her in the promenade of the theatre; she stood\r\nagainst a pillar, her eyes on the entrance. As their glances met,\r\nshe threw her head a little backwards, like one who looks through\r\nspectacles on the end of his nose, and showed her teeth. He sat down\r\nnear her.\r\n\r\nPresently she waved her hand to a man who was coming in. He seemed\r\nabout thirty, with small, clear eyes, bronzed cheeks, a heavy jaw, and\r\na closely trimmed brown moustache. He was fashionably garbed, though\r\nnot in evening dress, and he greeted her without raising his hat.\r\n\r\n"Shall we have a drink?" she suggested. "I\'m so thirsty."\r\n\r\n"Fizz?" the man drawled. She nodded.\r\n\r\nSoon they went out together, the man carelessly stuffing change for a\r\nfive-pound note into his pocket.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the difference between him and me?" Richard reflected as he\r\nwalked home. "But just wait a bit; wait till I\'ve...."\r\n\r\nWhen he reached his lodging the meanness of the room, of his clothes,\r\nof his supper, nauseated him. He dreamed that he was kissing the\r\nOttoman girl, and that she lisped, "Nice boy," whereupon he cast a\r\nhandful of sovereigns on her lap.\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock the next morning he was working at his article. In\r\ntwo days it was finished, and he had despatched it to a monthly\r\nmagazine, "together with a stamped directed envelope for its return if\r\nunsuitable," in accordance with the editorial instructions printed\r\nbelow the table of contents in every number. The editor of the\r\n"Trifler" promised that all manuscripts so submitted, and written on\r\none side of the paper only, should be dealt with promptly.\r\n\r\nHe had been expecting to discuss his work with Mr. Aked at the\r\nproposed dinner, but this had not taken place. On the morning after\r\nthe arrangement had been made, Mr. Aked fell ill, and in a few days he\r\nwrote to resign his post, saying that he had sufficient to live on, and\r\nfelt "too venerable for regular work."\r\n\r\nRichard held but the frailest hope that "A City of Sleep" would be\r\naccepted, but when the third morning arrived, and the postman brought\r\nnothing, his opinion of the article began to rise. Perhaps it had\r\nmerit, after all; he recalled certain parts of it which were distinctly\r\nclever and striking. Hurrying home from the office that afternoon, he\r\nmet the landlady\'s daughter on the stairs, and said casually,--\r\n\r\n"Any letters for me, Lily?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir." The girl had an attractive blush.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take a couple of eggs for tea, if Mrs. Rowbotham has them."\r\n\r\nHe remained at home in the evening, waiting for the last delivery,\r\nwhich occurred about 9:30. The double knocks of the postman were\r\naudible ten or twelve houses away. At last Richard heard him mounting\r\nthe steps of No. 74, and then his curt rat-tat shook the house. A\r\nlittle thud on the bare wooden floor of the hall seemed to indicate a\r\nheavier package than the ordinary letter.\r\n\r\nAs, when a man is drowning, the bad actions of a whole lifetime present\r\nthemselves to him in one awful flash, so at that moment all the faults,\r\nthe hopeless crudities, of "A City of Sleep" confronted Richard. He\r\nwondered at his own fatuity in imagining for a single instant that the\r\narticle had the barest chance of acceptance. Was it not notorious that\r\nfamous authors had written industriously for years without selling a\r\nline!\r\n\r\nLily came in with the supper-tray. She was smiling.\r\n\r\n"Warm work, eh, Lily?" he said, scarcely knowing that he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, it\'s that hot in the kitchen you wouldn\'t believe." Setting\r\ndown the tray, she handed him a foolscap envelope, and he saw his own\r\nhandwriting as if in a dream.\r\n\r\n"For me?" he murmured carelessly, and placed the letter on the\r\nmantelpiece. Lily took his orders for breakfast, and with a pleasant,\r\ntimid "Good-night, sir," left the room.\r\n\r\nHe opened the envelope. In the fold of his manuscript was a sheet\r\nof the best cream-laid note-paper bearing these words in flowing\r\ncopperplate: "The Editor presents his compliments to Mr. Larch\r\n[written] and regrets to be unable to use the enclosed article, for the\r\noffer of which he is much obliged."\r\n\r\nThe sight of this circular, with the offices of the magazine\r\nillustrated at the top, and the notification in the left-hand corner\r\nthat all letters must be addressed to the editor and not to any member\r\nof the staff individually, in some mysterious way mitigated Richard\'s\r\ndisappointment. Perhaps the comfort of it lay in the tangible assurance\r\nit afforded that he was now actually _a literary aspirant_ and had\r\ncommunications, however mortifying, with _the press_.\r\n\r\nHe read the circular again and again during supper, and determined to\r\nre-write the article. But this resolve was not carried out. He could\r\nnot bring himself even to glance through it, and finally it was sent to\r\nanother magazine exactly as it stood.\r\n\r\nRichard had determined to say nothing in the office about his writing\r\nuntil he could produce a printed article with his name at the foot;\r\nand frequently during the last few days his mouth had watered as he\r\nanticipated the sweetness of that triumph. But next day he could not\r\nrefrain from showing to Jenkins the note from the "Trifler." Jenkins\r\nseemed impressed, especially when Richard requested him to treat the\r\nmatter as confidential. A sort of friendship arose between them, and\r\nstrengthened as time went on. Richard sometimes wondered how precisely\r\nit had come about, and why it continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert Jenkins was nineteen years of age, and lived with his parents\r\nand seven brothers and sisters in Camberwell; his father managed a\r\nrefreshment bar in Oxford Street. He had been in the employ of Messrs.\r\nCurpet and Smythe for seven years,--first as junior office boy, then\r\nas senior office boy, and finally as junior shorthand clerk. He was\r\nof the average height, with a shallow chest, and thin arms and legs.\r\nHis feet were very small--he often referred to the fact with frank\r\ncomplacency--and were always encased in well-fitting hand-made boots,\r\nbrightly polished. The rest of his attire was less remarkable for\r\nneatness; but at intervals an ambition to be genteel possessed him,\r\nand during these recurrent periods the nice conduct of his fingernails\r\ninterfered somewhat with official routine. He carried his hat either\r\nat the back of his head or tilted almost upon the bridge of his nose.\r\nIn the streets he generally walked with sedate deliberation, his hands\r\ndeep in his pockets, his eyes lowered, and an enigmatic smile on his\r\nthin lips.\r\n\r\nHis countenance was of a pale yellow complexion just tinged with red,\r\nand he never coloured; his neck was a darker yellow. Upon the whole,\r\nhis features were regular, except the mouth, which was large, and\r\nprotruded like a monkey\'s; the eyes were grey, with a bold regard,\r\nwhich not seldom was excusably mistaken for insolence.\r\n\r\nConsidering his years, Jenkins was a highly accomplished person, in\r\ncertain directions. Upon all matters connected with her Majesty\'s mail\r\nand inland revenue, upon cab fares, bus-routes, and local railways,\r\nupon "Pitman outlines," and upon chamber practice in Chancery, he\r\nwas an unquestioned authority. He knew the addresses of several\r\nhundred London solicitors, the locality of nearly every street and\r\nsquare within the four-mile radius, and, within the same limits, the\r\napproximate distance of any one given spot from any other given spot.\r\n\r\nHe was the best billiard-player in the office, and had once made a\r\nspot-barred break of 49; this game was his sole pastime. He gambled\r\nregularly upon horse-races, resorting to a number of bookmakers, but\r\nneither winning nor losing to an appreciable extent; no less than three\r\njockeys occasionally permitted him to enjoy their companionship, and he\r\nwas never without a stable-tip.\r\n\r\nHis particular hobby, however, was restaurants. He spent half his\r\nincome upon food, and quite half his waking hours either in deciding\r\nwhat he should consume, or in actual drinking and mastication. He had\r\npersonally tested the merits of every bar and house of refreshment in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Law Courts, from Lockhart\'s to Gatti\'s, and\r\nwould discourse for hours on their respective virtues and defects. No\r\nrestaurant was too mean for his patronage, and none too splendid; for\r\ndays in succession he would dine upon a glass of water and a captain\r\nbiscuit with cheese, in order to accumulate resources for a delicate\r\nrepast in one of the gilded establishments where the rich are wont to\r\nsustain themselves; and he had acquired from his father a quantity of\r\ncurious lore, throwing light upon the secrets of the refreshment trade,\r\nwhich enabled him to spend the money thus painfully amassed to the best\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nJenkins was a cockney and the descendant of cockneys; he conversed\r\nalways volubly in the dialect of Camberwell; but just as he was subject\r\nto attacks of modishness, so at times he attempted to rid himself of\r\nhis accent, of course without success. He swore habitually, and used\r\nno reticence whatever, except in the presence of his employers and of\r\nMr. Alder the manager. In quick and effective retort he was the peer\r\nof cabmen, and nothing could abash him. His favourite subjects of\r\ndiscussion were restaurants, as before mentioned, billiards, the turf,\r\nand women, whom he usually described as "tarts." It was his custom to\r\nrefer to himself as a "devil for girls," and when Mr. Alder playfully\r\naccused him of adventures with females of easy virtue, his delight was\r\nunbounded.\r\n\r\nThere were moments when Richard loathed Jenkins, when the gross and\r\nribald atmosphere which attended Jenkins\' presence nauseated him, and\r\nutter solitude in London seemed preferable to the boy\'s company; but\r\nthese passed, and the intimacy throve. Jenkins, indeed, had his graces;\r\nhe was of an exceedingly generous nature, and his admiration for the\r\ndeep literary scholarship which he imagined Richard to possess was\r\ningenuous and unconcealed. His own agile wit, his picturesque use of\r\nslang, his facility in new oaths, and above all his exact knowledge of\r\nthe byways, and backwaters of London life, endowed him, in Richard\'s\r\nunaccustomed eyes, with a certain specious attractiveness. Moreover,\r\nthe fact that they shared the same room and performed similar duties\r\nmade familiar intercourse between them natural and necessary. With no\r\nother member of the staff did Richard care to associate. The articled\r\nclerks, though courteously agreeable to everyone, formed an exclusive\r\ncoterie; and as for the rest, they were either old or dull, or both.\r\nHe often debated whether he should seek out Mr. Aked, who was now\r\nrecovered, and had once, unfortunately in Richard\'s absence, called at\r\nthe office; but at length he timidly decided that the extent of their\r\nacquaintance would not warrant it.\r\n\r\n"Where shall we go to lunch to-day?" was almost the first question\r\nwhich Richard and Jenkins asked each other in the morning, and a\r\nprolonged discussion would follow. They called the meal "lunch," but it\r\nwas really their dinner, though neither of them ever admitted the fact.\r\n\r\nJenkins had a predilection for grill-rooms, where raw chops and\r\nsteaks lay on huge dishes, and each customer chose his own meat and\r\nsuperintended its cooking. A steak, tender and perfectly cooked, with\r\nbaked potatoes and half a pint of stout, was his ideal repast, and he\r\ncontinually lamented that no restaurant in London offered such cheer\r\nat the price of one shilling and threepence, including the waiter.\r\nThe cheap establishments were never satisfactory, and Jenkins only\r\nfrequented them when the state of his purse left no alternative. In\r\ncompany with Richard he visited every new eating-house that made its\r\nappearance, in the hope of finding the restaurant of his dreams, and\r\nthough each was a disappointment, yet the search still went on. The\r\nplace which most nearly coincided with his desires was the "Sceptre,"\r\na low, sombre room between the Law Courts and the river, used by\r\nwell-to-do managing clerks and a sprinkling of junior barristers. Here,\r\nlounging luxuriously on red plush seats, and in full sight and hearing\r\nof a large silver grill, the two spent many luncheon hours, eating\r\nslowly, with gross, sensual enjoyment, and secretly elated by the\r\nproximity of men older and more prosperous than themselves, whom they\r\nmet on equal terms.\r\n\r\nRichard once suggested that they should try one of the French\r\nrestaurants in Soho which Mr. Aked had mentioned.\r\n\r\n"Not me!" said Jenkins, in reply. "You don\'t catch me going to those\r\nparley-voo shops again. I went once. They give you a lot of little\r\nmesses, faked up from yesterday\'s dirty plates, and after you\'ve eaten\r\nhalf a dozen of \'em you don\'t feel a bit fuller. Give me a steak and a\r\npotato. I like to know what I\'m eating."\r\n\r\nHe had an equal detestation of vegetarian restaurants, but once, during\r\na period of financial depression, he agreed to accompany Richard,\r\nwho knew the place fairly well, to the "Crabtree" in Charing Cross\r\nRoad, and though he grumbled roundly at the insubstantiality of the\r\nthree-course dinner _\xe0 la carte_ which could be obtained for sixpence,\r\nhe made no difficulty, afterwards, about dining there whenever\r\nprudence demanded the narrowest economy.\r\n\r\nAn air of chill and prim discomfort pervaded the Crabtree, and the\r\nmingled odour of lentils and sultana pudding filled every corner. The\r\ntables were narrow, and the chairs unyielding. The customers were for\r\nthe most eccentric as to dress and demeanour; they had pale faces, and\r\nduring their melancholy meals perused volumes obviously instructive, or\r\ndebated the topics of the day in platitudinous conversations unspiced\r\nby a single oath. Young women with whom their personal appearance was\r\na negligible quantity came in large numbers, and either giggled to one\r\nanother without restraint or sat erect and glared at the males in a\r\nmanner which cowed even Jenkins. The waitresses lacked understanding,\r\nand seemed to resent even the most courteous advances.\r\n\r\nOne day, just as they were beginning dinner, Jenkins eagerly drew\r\nRichard\'s attention to the girl at the pay-desk. "See that girl?" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"What about her? Is she a new one?"\r\n\r\n"Why, she\'s the tart that old Aked used to be after."\r\n\r\n"Was she at that A. B. C. shop in the Strand?" said Richard, who began\r\nto remember the girl\'s features and her reddish brown hair.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s her. Before she was at the A. B. C. she was cashier at\r\nthat boiled-beef place opposite the Courts, but they say she got the\r\nsack for talking to customers too much. She and Aked were very thick\r\nthen, and he went there every day. I suppose his courting interfered\r\nwith business."\r\n\r\n"But he\'s old enough to be her father!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He ought to have been ashamed of himself. She\'s not a bad kind,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n"There wasn\'t anything between them, really, was there?"\r\n\r\n"_I_ don\'t know. There might have been. He followed her to the A. B. C,\r\nand I think he sometimes took her home. Her name\'s Roberts. We used to\r\nhave him on about her--rare fun."\r\n\r\nThe story annoyed Richard, for his short _t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate_ with Mr. Aked\r\nhad remained in his mind as a pleasant memory, and though he was aware\r\nthat the old man had been treated with scant respect by the youngsters\r\nin the office, he had acquired the habit of mentally regarding him\r\nwith admiration, as a representative of literature. This attachment to\r\na restaurant cashier, clearly a person of no refinement or intellect,\r\nscarcely fitted with his estimate of the journalist who had spoken to\r\nCarlyle.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal he surreptitiously glanced at the girl several times.\r\nShe was plumper than before, and her cough seemed to be cured. Her\r\nface was pleasant, and undoubtedly she had a magnificent coiffure.\r\n\r\nWhen they presented their checks, Jenkins bowed awkwardly, and she\r\nsmiled. He swore to Richard that next time he would mention Mr.\r\nAked\'s name to her. The vow was broken. She was willing to exchange\r\ncivilities, but her manner indicated with sufficient clearness that a\r\nline was to be drawn.\r\n\r\nIn the following week, when Richard happened to be at the Crabtree\r\nalone, at a later hour than usual, they had rather a long conversation.\r\n\r\n"Is Mr. Aked still at your office?" she asked, looking down at her\r\naccount books.\r\n\r\nRichard told what he knew.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she said, "I often used to see him, and he gave me some lozenges\r\nthat cured a bad cough I had. Nice old fellow, wasn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I fancy so," Richard assented.\r\n\r\n"I thought I\'d just ask, as I hadn\'t seen him about for a long time."\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon--Miss Roberts."\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon--Mr.----"\r\n\r\n"Larch."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed.\r\n\r\nA trivial dispute with Jenkins, a few days later, disclosed the\r\nfact that that haunter of bars had a sullen temper, and that his\r\ndispleasure, once aroused, was slow to disappear. Richard dined alone\r\nagain at the Crabtree, and after another little conversation with Miss\r\nRoberts, having time at his disposal, he called at the public library\r\nin St. Martin\'s Lane. In a half-crown review he saw an article, by a\r\nwriter of considerable repute, entitled "To Literary Aspirants," which\r\npurported to demonstrate that a mastery of the craft of words was only\r\nto be attained by a regular course of technical exercises; the nature\r\nof these exercises was described in detail. There were references to\r\nthe unremitting drudgery of Flaubert, de Maupassant, and Stevenson,\r\ntogether with extracts chosen to illustrate the slow passage of the\r\nlast-named author from inspired incompetence to the serene and perfect\r\nproficiency before which all difficulties melted. After an unqualified\r\nstatement that any man--slowly if without talent, quickly if gifted by\r\nnature--might with determined application learn to write finely, the\r\nessayist concluded by remarking that never before in the history of\r\nliterature had young authors been so favourably circumstanced as at\r\nthat present. Lastly came the maxim, _Nulla dies sine linea_.\r\n\r\nRichard\'s cooling enthusiasm for letters leaped into flame. He had\r\ndone no writing whatever for several weeks, but that night saw him\r\ndesperately at work. He took advantage of the quarrel to sever all\r\nsave the most formal connection with Jenkins, dined always frugally at\r\nthe Crabtree, and spent every evening at his lodging. The thought of\r\nAlphonse Daudet writing "Les Amoureuses" in a Parisian garret supported\r\nhim through an entire month of toil, during which, besides assiduously\r\npractising the recommended exercises, he wrote a complete short story\r\nand began several essays. About this time his "City of Sleep" was\r\nreturned upon his hands in a condition so filthy and ragged that he was\r\nmoved to burn it. The short story was offered to an evening daily, and\r\nnever heard of again.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that possibly he possessed some talent for dramatic\r\ncriticism, and one Saturday evening he went to the first performance\r\nof a play at the St. George\'s theatre. After waiting for an hour\r\noutside, he got a seat in the last row of the pit. Eagerly he watched\r\nthe critics take their places in the stalls; they chatted languidly,\r\nsmiling and bowing now and then to acquaintances in the boxes and dress\r\ncircle; the pit was excited and loquacious, and Richard discovered that\r\nnearly everyone round about him made a practice of attending first\r\nnights, and had an intimate knowledge of the _personnel_ of the stage.\r\nThrough the hum of voices the overture to "Rosamund" fitfully reached\r\nhim. During whole bars the music was lost; then some salient note\r\ncaught the ear, and the melody became audible again until another wave\r\nof conversation engulfed it.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the last act was greeted with frenzied hand-clapping,\r\nbeating of sticks, and inarticulate cries, while above the general\r\nnoise was heard the repeated monosyllable "\'thor, \'thor." After what\r\nseemed an interminable delay the curtain was drawn back at one side\r\nand a tall man in evening dress, his face a dead white, stepped before\r\nthe footlights and bowed several times; the noise rose to a thunderous\r\nroar, in which howls and hissing were distinguishable. Richard shook\r\nfrom head to foot, and tears unaccountably came to his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Sunday and Monday evening were occupied in writing a\r\ndetailed analysis and appreciation of the play. On Tuesday morning he\r\nbought a weekly paper which devoted special attention to the drama, in\r\norder to compare his own view with that of an acknowledged authority,\r\nand found that the production was dismissed in ten curt lines as mere\r\namiable drivel.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards Mr. Curpet offered him the position of cashier\r\nin the office, at a salary of three pounds a week. His income was\r\nexactly doubled, and the disappointments of unsuccessful authorship\r\nsuddenly ceased to trouble him. He began to doubt the wisdom of making\r\nany further attempt towards literature. Was it not clear that his\r\ntalents lay in the direction of business? Nevertheless a large part\r\nof his spare cash was devoted to the purchase of books, chiefly the\r\nproductions of a few celebrated old continental presses, which he had\r\nrecently learned to value. He prepared a scheme for educating himself\r\nin the classical tongues and in French, and the practice of writing was\r\nabandoned to make opportunity for the pursuit of culture. But culture\r\nproved to be shy and elusive. He adhered to no regular course of study,\r\nand though he read much, his progress towards knowledge was almost\r\nimperceptible.\r\n\r\nOther distractions presented themselves in the shape of music and\r\npainting. He discovered that he was not without critical taste\r\nin both these arts, and he became a frequenter of concerts and\r\npicture-galleries. He bought a piano on the hire-purchase system, and\r\ntook lessons thereon. In this and other ways his expenditure swelled\r\ntill it more than swallowed up the income of three pounds a week which\r\nnot long before he had regarded as something very like wealth. For\r\nmany weeks he made no effort to adjust the balance, until his debts\r\napproached the sum of twenty pounds, nearly half of which was owing to\r\nhis landlady. He had to go through more than one humiliating scene\r\nbefore an era of economy set in.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he received a telegram to say that William Vernon had\r\ndied very suddenly. It was signed "Alice Clayton Vernon." Mrs. Vernon\r\nwas William\'s stately cousin-in-law, and Richard, to whom she had\r\nspoken only once,--soon after Mary\'s wedding,--regarded her with awe;\r\nhe disliked her because he found it impossible to be at ease in her\r\nimposing presence. As he went into Mr. Curpet\'s room to ask for leave\r\nof absence, his one feeling was annoyance at the prospect of having\r\nto meet her again. William\'s death, to his own astonishment, scarcely\r\naffected him at all.\r\n\r\nMr. Curpet readily granted him two days\' holiday, and he arranged to go\r\ndown to Bursley the following night for the funeral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWearied of sitting, Richard folded his overcoat pillow-wise, put it\r\nunder his head, and extended himself on the polished yellow wood. But\r\nin vain were his eyes shut tight. Sleep would not come, though he\r\nyawned incessantly. The monstrous beat of the engine, the quick rattle\r\nof windows, and the grinding of wheels were fused into a fantastic\r\nresonance which occupied every corner of the carriage and invaded his\r\nvery skull. Then a light tapping on the roof, one of those mysterious\r\nsounds which make a compartment in a night-train like a haunted room,\r\nmomentarily silenced everything else, and he wished that he had not\r\nbeen alone.\r\n\r\nSuddenly jumping up, he put away all idea of sleep, and lowered the\r\nwindow. It was pitch dark; vague changing shapes, which might have been\r\neither trees or mere fancies of the groping eye, outlined themselves a\r\nshort distance away; far in front was a dull glare from the engine, and\r\nbehind twinkled the guard\'s lamp.... In a few seconds he closed the\r\nwindow again, chilled to the bone, though May was nearly at an end.\r\n\r\nThe thought occurred to him that he was now a solitary upon the face\r\nof the earth. It concerned no living person whether he did evil or\r\ngood. If he chose to seek ruin, to abandon himself to the most ignoble\r\nimpulses, there was none to restrain,--not even a brother-in-law. For\r\nseveral weeks past, he had been troubled about his future, afraid\r\nto face it. Certainly London satisfied him, and the charm of living\r\nthere had not perceptibly grown less. He rejoiced in London, in its\r\nvistas, its shops, its unending crowds, its vastness, its wickedness;\r\neach dream dreamed about London in childhood had come true; and surer\r\nthan ever before was the consciousness that in going to London he had\r\nfulfilled his destiny. Yet there was something to lack in himself.\r\nHis confidence in his own abilities and his own character was being\r\nundermined. Nearly a year had gone, and he had made no progress, except\r\nat the office. Resolutions were constantly broken; it was three months\r\nsince he had despatched an article to a newspaper. He had not even\r\nfollowed a definite course of study, and though his acquaintance with\r\nmodern French fiction had widened, he could boast no exact scholarship\r\neven in that piquant field. Evening after evening--ah! those long,\r\nlamplit evenings which were to be given to strenuous effort!--was\r\nfrittered away upon mean banalities, sometimes in the company of some\r\ncasual acquaintance and sometimes alone. He had by no means grasped the\r\nfull import and extent of this retrogression; it was merely beginning\r\nto disturb his self-complacence, and perhaps, ever so slightly, his\r\nsleep. But now, hurrying to the funeral of William Vernon, he lazily\r\nlaughed at himself for having allowed his peace of mind to be ruffled.\r\nWhy bother about "getting on"? What did it matter?\r\n\r\nHe still experienced but little sorrow at the death of Vernon. His\r\naffection for the man had strangely faded. During the nine months that\r\nhe had lived in London they had scarcely written to one another, and\r\nRichard regarded the long journey to attend William\'s obsequies as a\r\ntiresome concession to propriety.\r\n\r\nThat was his real attitude, had he cared to examine it.\r\n\r\nAt about four o\'clock it was quite light, and the risen sun woke\r\nRichard from a brief doze. The dew lay in the hollows of the fields but\r\nelsewhere there was a soft, fresh clearness which gave to the common\r\nincidents of the flying landscape a new and virginal beauty--as though\r\nthat had been the morn of creation itself. The cattle were stirring,\r\nand turned to watch the train as it slipped by.\r\n\r\nRichard opened the window again. His mood had changed, and he felt\r\nunreasonably joyous. Last night he had been too pessimistic. Life lay\r\nyet before him, and time enough to rectify any indiscretions of which\r\nhe might have been guilty. The future was his, to use as he liked.\r\nMagnificent, consoling thought! Moved by some symbolic association of\r\nideas, he put his head out of the window and peered in the direction of\r\nthe train\'s motion. A cottage stood alone in the midst of innumerable\r\nmeadows; as it crossed his vision, the door opened, and a young woman\r\ncame out with an empty pail swinging in her left hand. Apparently she\r\nwould be about twenty-seven, plump and sturdy and straight. Her hair\r\nwas loose about her round, contented face, and with her disengaged\r\nhand she rubbed her eyes, still puffed and heavy with sleep. She wore\r\na pink print gown, the bodice of which was unfastened, disclosing a\r\nwhite undergarment and the rich hemispheres of her bosom. In an instant\r\nthe scene was hidden by a curve of the line, and the interminable\r\nsuccession of fields resumed, but Richard had time to guess from her\r\nfigure that the woman was the mother of a small family. He pictured her\r\nhusband still unconscious in the warm bed which she had just left; he\r\neven saw the impress of her head on the pillow, and a long nightdress\r\nthrown hastily across a chair.\r\n\r\nHe was deeply and indescribably affected by this suggestion of peaceful\r\nmarried love set in so great a solitude. The woman and her hypothetical\r\nhusband and children were only peasants, their lives were probably\r\nnarrow and their intellects dormant, yet they aroused in him a feeling\r\nof envy which surged about his brain and for the moment asphyxiated\r\nthought....\r\n\r\nLater on the train slackened speed as it passed through a\r\nshunting-yard. The steam from the light shunting-engine rose with\r\ncloud-like delicacy in the clear air, and an occasional short whistle\r\nseemed to have something of the quality of a bird\'s note. The men with\r\ntheir long poles moved blithely among the medley of rails, signalling\r\none another with motions of the arm. The coupling-chains rang with a\r\nmerry, giant tinkle, and when the engine brought its load of waggons to\r\na standstill, and a smart, metallic bump, bump, bump ran _diminuendo_\r\nfrom waggon to waggon, one might have fancied that some leviathan game\r\nwas being played. Richard forgot the girl with the pail, and soon after\r\nwent to sleep.\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock the train reached Knype, where he had to change. Two\r\nwomen with several children also alighted, and he noticed how white\r\nand fatigued were their faces; the children yawned pitifully. An icy,\r\nsearching wind blew through the station; the exhilaration of the\r\ndawn was gone, and a spirit of utter woe and disaster brooded over\r\neverything. For the first time William\'s death really touched him.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Bursley were nearly empty as he walked through the town\r\nfrom the railway station, for the industrial population was already\r\nat work in the manufactories, and the shops not yet open. Yet Richard\r\navoided the main thoroughfares, choosing a circuitous route lest he\r\nmight by chance encounter an acquaintance. He foresaw the inevitable\r\nbanal dialogue:--\r\n\r\n"Well, how do you like London?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s fine!"\r\n\r\n"Getting on all right?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, thanks."\r\n\r\nAnd then the effort of two secretly bored persons to continue a\r\nperfunctory conversation unaided by a single mutual interest.\r\n\r\nA carriage was driving away from the Red House just as Richard got\r\nwithin sight of it; he nodded to the venerable coachman, who gravely\r\ntouched his hat. The owner of the carriage was Mr. Clayton Vernon,\r\nWilliam\'s cousin and an alderman of Bursley, and Richard surmised that\r\nMrs. Clayton Vernon had put herself in charge of the place until the\r\nfuneral should be over. He trembled at the prospect of a whole day to\r\nbe spent in the company of these excellent people, whom William had\r\nalways referred to with a smile, and yet not without a great deal of\r\nrespect. The Clayton Vernons were the chief buttress of respectability\r\nin the town; rich, strictly religious, philanthropic, and above all\r\ndignified. Everyone looked up to them instinctively, and had they\r\npossessed but one vice between them, they would have been loved.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clayton Vernon herself opened the door. She was a stately woman of\r\nadvanced middle age, with a suave, imperious manner.\r\n\r\n"I left Clayton to have breakfast by himself," she said, as she led\r\nRichard into the sitting-room; "I thought you would like someone here\r\nto welcome you after your long night journey. Breakfast will be ready\r\nalmost directly. How tired you must be! Clayton said it was a pity you\r\nshould come by the night train, but of course it is quite right that\r\nyou should inconvenience your employers as little as possible, quite\r\nright. And we admire you for it. Now will you run upstairs and wash?\r\nYou\'ve not forgotten the way?..."\r\n\r\nThe details of the funeral had been settled by Mr. Clayton Vernon,\r\nwho was the chief mourner, and Richard had nothing to do but fall in\r\nwith preconcerted plans and answer decorously when spoken to. The\r\narrangement was satisfactory in that it relieved him from duties which\r\nwould have been irksome, but scarcely gratifying to his pride. He had\r\nlived nearly all his life in that house, and had known the dead man\r\nperhaps more intimately than anyone else present. However, he found it\r\nconvenient to efface himself.\r\n\r\nIn the evening there was an elaborate tea at which were present the\r\nClayton Vernons and the minister who had conducted the funeral service.\r\nThe minister and the alderman left immediately afterwards to attend a\r\nmeeting, and when they were gone Mrs. Clayton Vernon said,--\r\n\r\n"Now we are all alone, Richard. Go into the drawing-room and I will\r\nfollow. I do want to have a chat with you."\r\n\r\nShe came in with needle and thread and scissors.\r\n\r\n"If you will take off your coat, I will stitch on that button that is\r\nhanging by one thread. I noticed it this morning, and then it went\r\nquite out of my mind. I am so sorry!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, thanks!" he blushed hotly. "But I can stitch myself, you know--"\r\n\r\n"Come, you needn\'t be shy of an old woman seeing you in your\r\nshirt-sleeves. Do as I ask."\r\n\r\nHe doffed the coat.\r\n\r\n"I always like young men to be immaculately neat," she said, cutting\r\noff a piece of cotton. "One\'s personal character is an index to one\'s\r\ncharacter, don\'t you think? Of course you do. Here, thread the needle\r\nfor me. I am afraid since your dear sister died you have grown a little\r\ncareless, eh? She was _most_ particular. Ah, what a mother she was to\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Richard.\r\n\r\n"I was very grieved to see you go to the funeral in a soft\r\nhat--Richard, really I was. It wasn\'t respectful to your\r\nbrother-in-law\'s memory."\r\n\r\n"I never thought. You see, I started in rather a hurry." The fact was\r\nthat he had no silk hat, nor could he easily afford to buy one.\r\n\r\n"But you _should_ think, my dear boy. Even Clayton was shocked. Are\r\nthose your best clothes?"\r\n\r\nRichard answered that they were. He sheepishly protested that he never\r\nbothered about clothes.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, broken by her regular stitching. At last she\r\nhanded him the coat and helped him to put it on. He went to the old\r\ngreen sofa, and somewhat to his dismay she sat down by his side.\r\n\r\n"Richard," she began, in a changed, soft voice, and not without\r\nemotion, "do you know we are expecting great things from you?"\r\n\r\n"But you shouldn\'t. I\'m a very ordinary sort of person."\r\n\r\n"No, no. That you are not. God has given you great talents, and you\r\nmust use them. Poor William always used to say that you were highly\r\ngifted and might do great things."\r\n\r\n"Might!"\r\n\r\n"Yes--if you tried."\r\n\r\n"But how am I gifted? And what \'great things\' are expected?" he asked,\r\nperhaps angling for further flattering disclosures.\r\n\r\n"I cannot answer that," said Mrs. Clayton Vernon; "it is for you to\r\nanswer. You have given all your friends the impression that you would\r\ndo something worth doing. You have raised hopes, and you must not\r\ndisappoint them. We believe in you, Richard. That is all I can say."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well; but--" He stopped and played with the seal on\r\nhis watch-chain. "The fact is, I am working, you know. I want to be an\r\nauthor--at least a journalist."\r\n\r\n"Ah!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a slow business--at first--" Suddenly moved to be confidential,\r\nhe went on to give her some account, incomplete and judiciously\r\nedited, of his life during the past year.\r\n\r\n"You have relieved my mind greatly, and Clayton will be so glad. We\r\nwere beginning to think--"\r\n\r\n"Why were you \'beginning to think\'?"\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind now."\r\n\r\n"But why?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind. I have full confidence in you, and I am sure you will get\r\non. Poor boy, you have no near connections or relatives now?"\r\n\r\n"No, none."\r\n\r\n"You must look on Clayton and myself as very near relatives. We have no\r\nchildren, but our hearts are large. I shall expect you to write to me\r\nsometimes and to come and stay with us now and then."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the reading-room at the British Museum sit four men\r\nfenced about by a quadruple ring of unwieldy volumes which are an index\r\nto all the knowledge in the world. The four men know those volumes as\r\na good courier knows the Continental Bradshaw, and all day long, from\r\nearly morning, when the attendants, self-propelled on wheeled stools,\r\nrun around the rings arranging and aligning the huge blue tomes, to\r\nlate afternoon, when the immense dome is like a dark night and the\r\narc lamps hiss and crackle in the silence, they answer questions,\r\npatiently, courteously; they are seldom embarrassed and less seldom in\r\nthe wrong.\r\n\r\nRadiating in long rows from the central fortress of learning, a\r\ndiversified company of readers disposes itself: bishops, statesmen,\r\nmen of science, historians, needy pedants, popular authors whose\r\nbroughams are waiting in the precincts, journalists, medical students,\r\nlaw students, curates, hack-writers, women with clipped hair and black\r\naprons, idlers; all short-sighted and all silent.\r\n\r\nEvery few minutes an official enters in charge of an awed group of\r\ncountry visitors, and whispers mechanically the unchanging formula:\r\n"Eighty thousand volumes in this room alone: thirty-six miles of\r\nbookshelves in the Museum altogether." Whereupon the visitors stare\r\nabout them, the official unsuccessfully endeavours not to let it appear\r\nthat the credit of the business belongs entirely to himself, and the\r\nparty retires again.\r\n\r\nVague, reverberating noises roll heavily from time to time across the\r\nchamber, but no one looks up; the incessant cannibal feast of the\r\nliving upon the dead goes speechlessly forward; the trucks of food are\r\nalways moving to and fro, and the nonchalant waiters seem to take no\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nAlmost Richard\'s first care on coming to London had been to obtain\r\na reader\'s ticket for the British Museum, and for several months he\r\nhad made a practice of spending Saturday afternoon there, following\r\nno special line of study or research, and chiefly contenting himself\r\nwith desultory reading in the twenty thousand volumes which could be\r\nreached down without the slow machinery of an order form. After a time\r\nthe charm of the place had dwindled, and other occupations filled his\r\nSaturday afternoons.\r\n\r\nBut when upon his return from William\'s funeral he stepped from\r\nEuston Station into Bloomsbury, the old enthusiasms came back in all\r\ntheir original freshness. The seduction of the street vistas, the\r\nlofty buildings, and the swiftly flitting hansoms once more made mere\r\nwayfaring a delight; the old feeling of self-confident power lifted his\r\nchin, and the failures of the past were forgotten in a dream of future\r\npossibilities. He dwelt with pleasure on that part of his conversation\r\nwith Mrs. Clayton Vernon which disclosed the interesting fact that\r\nBursley would be hurt if he failed to do "things." Bursley, and\r\nespecially Mrs. Clayton Vernon, good woman, should not be disappointed.\r\nHe had towards his native town the sentiments of a consciously clever\r\nhusband who divines an admiring trust in the glance of a little\r\nignoramus of a wife. Such faith was indeed touching.\r\n\r\nOne of the numerous resolutions which he made was to resume attendance\r\nat the British Museum; the first visit was anticipated with impatience,\r\nand when he found himself once more within the book-lined walls of the\r\nreading-room he was annoyed to discover that his plans for study were\r\nnot matured sufficiently to enable him to realise any definite part\r\nof them, however small, that day. An idea for an article on "White\r\nElephants" was nebulous in his brain; he felt sure that the subject\r\nmight be treated in a fascinating manner, if only he could put hands\r\non the right material. An hour passed in searching Poole\'s Index\r\nand other works of reference, without result, and Richard spent the\r\nremainder of the afternoon in evolving from old magazines schemes\r\nfor articles which would present fewer difficulties in working out.\r\nNothing of value was accomplished, and yet he experienced neither\r\ndisappointment nor a sense of failure. Contact with innumerable books\r\nof respectable but forbidding appearance had cajoled him, as frequently\r\nbefore, into the delusion that he had been industrious; surely it was\r\nimpossible that a man could remain long in that atmosphere of scholarly\r\nattainment without acquiring knowledge and improving his mind!\r\n\r\nPresently he abandoned the concoction of attractive titles for his\r\narticles, and began to look through some volumes of the "Biographie\r\nUniverselle." The room was thinning now. He glanced at the clock; it\r\nwas turned six. He had been there nearly four hours! With a sigh of\r\nsatisfaction he replaced all his books and turned to go, mentally\r\ndiscussing whether or not so much application did not entitle him, in\r\nspite of certain resolutions, to go to the Ottoman that evening.\r\n\r\n"Hey!" a voice called out as he passed the glass screen near the door;\r\nit sang resonantly among the desks and ascended into the dome; a number\r\nof readers looked up. Richard turned round sharply, and beheld Mr.\r\nAked moving a forefinger on the other side of the screen.\r\n\r\n"Been here long?" the older man asked, when Richard had come round\r\nto him. "I\'ve been here all day--first time for fifteen years at\r\nleast. Strange we didn\'t see each other. They\'ve got a beastly new\r\nregulation about novels less than five years old not being available. I\r\nparticularly wanted some of Gissing\'s--not for the mere fun of reading\r\n\'em of course, because I\'ve read \'em before. I wanted them for a\r\nspecial purpose--I may tell you about it some day--and I couldn\'t get\r\nthem, at least several of them. What a tremendous crowd there is here\r\nnowadays!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, it\'s Saturday afternoon," Richard put in, "and Saturday\r\nafternoon\'s the only time that most people can come, unless they\'re men\r\nof independent means like yourself. You seem to have got a few novels\r\nbesides Gissing\'s, though." About forty volumes were stacked upon Mr.\r\nAked\'s desk, many of them open.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I\'ve done now." He began to close the books with a smack and\r\nto pitch them down roughly in new heaps, exactly like a petulant boy\r\nhandling school-books. "See, pile them between my arms, and I bet you\r\nI\'ll carry them away all at once."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. I\'ll help you," Richard laughed. "It\'ll be far less trouble\r\nthan picking up what you drop."\r\n\r\nWhile they were waiting at the centre desk Mr. Aked said,--\r\n\r\n"There\'s something about this place that makes you ask for more volumes\r\nthan can possibly be useful to you. I question whether I\'ve done any\r\ngood here to-day at all. If I\'d been content with three or four books\r\ninstead of thirty or forty, I might have done something. By the way,\r\nwhat are you here for?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I just came to look up a few points," Richard answered vaguely.\r\n"I\'ve been messing about--got a notion or two for articles, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nMr. Aked stopped to shake hands as soon as they were outside the\r\nMuseum. Richard was very disappointed that their meeting should have\r\nbeen so short. This man of strange vivacity had thrown a spell over\r\nhim. Richard was sure that his conversation, if only he could be\r\npersuaded to talk, would prove delightfully original and suggestive;\r\nhe guessed that they were mutually sympathetic. Ever since their\r\nencounter in the A. B. C. shop Richard had desired to know more of\r\nhim, and now, when by chance they met again, Mr. Aked\'s manner showed\r\nlittle or no inclination towards a closer acquaintance. There was of\r\ncourse a difference between them in age of at least thirty years, but\r\nto Richard that seemed no bar to an intimacy. It was, he surmised, only\r\nthe physical part of Mr. Aked that had grown old.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye." Should he ask if he might call at Mr. Aked\'s rooms or\r\nhouse, or whatever his abode was? He hesitated, from nervousness.\r\n\r\n"Often come here?"\r\n\r\n"Generally on Saturdays," said Richard.\r\n\r\n"We may see each other again, then, sometime. Good-bye."\r\n\r\nRichard left him rather sadly, and the sound of the old man\'s quick,\r\nalert footsteps--he almost stamped--receded in the direction of\r\nSouthampton Row. A minute later, as Richard was turning round by\r\nMudie\'s out of Museum Street, a hand touched his shoulder. It was Mr.\r\nAked\'s.\r\n\r\n"By the way," the man\'s face crinkled into a smile as he spoke, "are\r\nyou doing anything to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing whatever."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go and have dinner together--I know a good French place in Soho."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thanks. I shall be awfully pleased."\r\n\r\n"Half a crown, _table d\'h\xf4te_. Can you afford?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I can," said Richard, perhaps a little annoyed, until\r\nhe recollected that Mr. Aked had used exactly the same phrase on a\r\nprevious occasion.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pay for the wine."\r\n\r\n"Not at all--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pay for the wine," Mr. Aked repeated decisively.\r\n\r\n"All right. You told me about this Soho place before, if you remember."\r\n\r\n"So I did, so I did, so I did."\r\n\r\n"What made you turn back?"\r\n\r\n"A whim, young friend, nothing else. Take my arm."\r\n\r\nRichard laughed aloud, for no reason in particular, except that he felt\r\nhappy. They settled to a brisk walk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe restaurant was a square apartment with a low and smoky beamed\r\nceiling, and shining brass hat-pegs all round the walls; above the\r\nhat-pegs were framed advertisements of liqueurs and French, Italian,\r\nand Spanish wines. The little tables, whose stiff snowy cloths came\r\nnear to touching the floor at every side, gleamed and glittered in the\r\nlight of a fire. The place was empty save for an old waiter who was\r\nlighting the gas. The waiter turned a large, mild countenance to Mr.\r\nAked as the two entered, and smiling benignly greeted him with a flow\r\nof French, and received a brief reply in the same language. Richard\r\nfailed to comprehend what was said.\r\n\r\nThey chose a table near the fire. Mr. Aked at once pulled a book from\r\nhis pocket and began to read; and Richard, somewhat accustomed by this\r\ntime to his peculiarities, found nothing extraordinary in such conduct.\r\nThis plain little restaurant seemed full of enchantment. He was in\r\nParis,--not the great Paris which is reached _via_ Charing Cross, but\r\nthat little Paris which hides itself in the immensity of London. French\r\nnewspapers were scattered about the room; the sound of French voices\r\ncame musically through an open door; the bread which was presently\r\nbrought in with the _hors d\'oeuvre_ was French, and the setting of the\r\ntable itself showed an exotic daintiness which he had never seen before.\r\n\r\nOutside a barrel organ was piercingly strident in the misty dusk. Above\r\nthe ground-glass panes of the window, Richard could faintly descry the\r\nupper storeys of houses on the opposite side of the road. There was a\r\nblack and yellow sign, "Umberto Club," and above that a blue and red\r\nsign, "Blanchisserie fran\xe7aise." Still higher was an open window from\r\nwhich leaned a young, negligently dressed woman with a coarse Southern\r\nface; she swung a bird-cage idly in her hand; the bird-cage fell\r\nand was swallowed by the ground glass, and the woman with a gesture\r\nof despair disappeared from the window; the barrel organ momentarily\r\nceased its melody and then struck up anew.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed strangely, delightfully unsubstantial, even the\r\nmeek, bland face of the waiter as he deftly poured out the soup. Mr.\r\nAked, having asked for the wine list, called "Cinquante, Georges, s\'il\r\nvous plait," and divided his attention impartially between his soup\r\nand his book. Richard picked up the "Echo de Paris" which lay on a\r\nneighbouring chair. On the first page was a reference in displayed type\r\nto the success of the feuilleton "_de notre collaborateur distingu\xe9_,"\r\nCatulle Mend\xe8s. How wondrously enticing the feuilleton looked, with its\r\ndescriptive paragraphs cleverly diversified by short lines of dialogue,\r\nand at the end "CATULLE MEND\xc8S, _\xe0 suivre. R\xe9production interdite!_"\r\nHalf Paris, probably, was reading that feuilleton! Catulle Mend\xe8s was a\r\nreal man, and no doubt eating his dinner at that moment!\r\n\r\nWhen the fish came, and Georges had gently poured out the wine, Mr.\r\nAked\'s tongue was loosed.\r\n\r\n"And how has the Muse been behaving herself?" he began.\r\n\r\nRichard told him, with as little circumlocution as pride would allow,\r\nthe history of the last few sterile months.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you feel a bit downhearted."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least!" answered Richard, bravely, and just then his reply\r\nwas approximately true.\r\n\r\n"_Never_ feel downhearted?"\r\n\r\n"Well, of course one gets a bit sick sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see, to-day\'s the 30th. How many words have you written this\r\nmonth?"\r\n\r\n"How many words!" Richard laughed. "I never count what I do in that\r\nway. But it\'s not much. I haven\'t felt in the humour. There was the\r\nfuneral. That put me off."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you think you must write only _when the mood is on you_."\r\nMr. Aked spoke sarcastically, and then laughed. "Quite a mistake. I\'ll\r\ngive you this bit of advice and charge nothing for it. Sit down every\r\nnight and write five hundred words descriptive of some scene which has\r\noccurred during the day. Never mind how tired you are; do it. Do it\r\nfor six months, and then compare the earlier work with the later, and\r\nyou\'ll keep on."\r\n\r\nRichard drank the wisdom in.\r\n\r\n"Did you do that once?"\r\n\r\n"I did, sir. Everyone does it that comes to anything. I didn\'t come to\r\nanything, though I made a bit of money at one time. But then mine was\r\na queer case. I was knocked over by dyspepsia. Beware of dyspepsia. I\r\nwas violently dyspeptic for twenty years--simply couldn\'t write. Then\r\nI cured myself. But it was too late to begin again." He spoke in gulps\r\nbetween mouthfuls of fish.\r\n\r\n"How did you cure yourself?"\r\n\r\nThe man took no notice of the question, and went on:--\r\n\r\n"And if I haven\'t written anything for twenty years, I\'m still an\r\nauthor at heart. In fact, I\'ve got something \'in the air\' now. Oh! I\'ve\r\nalways had the literary temperament badly. Do you ever catch yourself\r\nwatching instinctively for the characteristic phrase?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I don\'t quite know what you mean."\r\n\r\n"Eh?"\r\n\r\nRichard repeated what he had said, but Mr. Aked was absorbed in pouring\r\nout another glass of wine.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d tell me," Richard began, after a pause, "how you first\r\n_began_ to write, or rather to get printed."\r\n\r\n"My dear little friend, I can\'t tell you anything new. I wrote for\r\nseveral years and never sold a line. And for what peculiar reason,\r\nshould you think? Simply because not a line was worth printing. Then my\r\nthings began to be accepted. I sold a story first; I forget the title,\r\nbut I remember there was a railway accident in it, and it happened to\r\ncome before the editor of a magazine just when everyone was greatly\r\nexcited about a railway smash in the West of England. I got thirty\r\nshillings for that."\r\n\r\n"I think I should get on all right enough if only I could sell _one_\r\nthing." Richard sighed.\r\n\r\n"Well, you must wait. Why, damn it all, man!"--he stopped to drink, and\r\nRichard noticed how his hand shook. "How long have you been working\r\nseriously? Not a year! If you were going in for painting, you surely\r\nwouldn\'t expect to sell pictures after only a year\'s study?" Mr. Aked\r\nshowed a na\xefve appreciation of himself in the part of a veteran who\r\ndeigns to give a raw recruit the benefit of vast experience.\r\n\r\n"Of course not," assented Richard, abashed.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, don\'t begin to whine."\r\n\r\nAfter the cheese Mr. Aked ordered coffee and cognac, and sixpenny\r\ncigars. They smoked in silence.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," Richard blurted out at length, "the fact is I\'m not\r\nsure that I\'m meant for writing at all. I never take any pleasure\r\n_in_ writing. It\'s a confounded nuisance." He almost trembled with\r\napprehension as he uttered the words.\r\n\r\n"You like thinking about what you\'re going to write, arranging,\r\nobserving, etc.?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I like that awfully."\r\n\r\n"Well, here\'s a secret. No writer does like writing, at least not one\r\nin a hundred, and the exception, ten to one, is a howling mediocrity.\r\nThat\'s a fact. But all the same they\'re miserable if they don\'t write."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad; there\'s hope."\r\n\r\nWhen Richard had finished his coffee, it occurred to him to mention\r\nMiss Roberts.\r\n\r\n"Do you ever go to the Crabtree?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Not of late."\r\n\r\n"I only ask because there\'s a girl there who knows you. She inquired of\r\nme how you were not long since."\r\n\r\n"A girl who knows me? Who the devil may she be?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy her name\'s Roberts."\r\n\r\n"Aha! So she\'s got a new place, has she? She lives in my street. That\'s\r\nhow I know her. Nice little thing, rather!"\r\n\r\nHe made no further remark on the subject, but there remained an absent,\r\namused smile on his face, and he pulled at his lower lip and fastened\r\nhis gaze on the table.\r\n\r\n"You must come down sometime, and see me; my niece keeps house for me,"\r\nhe said before they separated, giving an address in Fulham. He wrung\r\nRichard\'s hand, patted him on the shoulder, winking boyishly, and went\r\noff whistling to himself very quietly in the upper register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe slender, badly hung gate closed of itself behind him with a\r\nresounding clang, communicating a little thrill to the ground.\r\n\r\nIn answer to his ring a girl came to the door. She was rather short,\r\nthin, and dressed in black, with a clean white apron. In the half light\r\nof the narrow lobby he made out a mahogany hat-rack of conventional\r\nshape, and on a wooden bracket a small lamp with a tarnished reflector.\r\n\r\n"No," Richard heard in a quiet, tranquil voice, "Mr. Aked has just gone\r\nout for a walk. He didn\'t say what time he should be back. Can I give\r\nhim any message?"\r\n\r\n"He sent me a card to come down and see him this afternoon, and--I\'ve\r\ncome. He said about seven o\'clock. It\'s a quarter past now. But perhaps\r\nhe forgot all about it."\r\n\r\n"Will you step inside? He may only be away for a minute or two."\r\n\r\n"No, thanks. If you\'ll just tell him I\'ve called--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry--" The girl raised her hand and rested it against the\r\njamb of the doorway; her eyes were set slantwise on the strip of\r\ngarden, and she seemed to muse an instant.\r\n\r\n"Are you Mr. Larch?" she asked hesitatingly, just as Richard was saying\r\ngood-day.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Richard.\r\n\r\n"Uncle was telling me he had had dinner with you. I\'m _sure_ he\'ll be\r\nback soon. Won\'t you wait a little while?"\r\n\r\n"Well--"\r\n\r\nShe stood aside, and Richard passed into the lobby.\r\n\r\nThe front room, into which he was ushered, was full of dim shadows,\r\nattributable to the multiplicity of curtains which obscured the\r\nsmall bay window. Carteret Street and the half-dozen florid, tawny,\r\ntree-lined avenues that run parallel to it contain hundreds of living\r\nrooms almost precisely similar. Its dimensions were thirteen feet by\r\neleven, and the height of the ceiling appeared to bring the walls,\r\nwhich were papered in an undecipherable pattern of blue, even closer\r\ntogether than they really were. Linoleum with a few rugs served for\r\na carpet. The fireplace was of painted stone, and a fancy screen of\r\nSouth African grasses hid the grate. Behind a clock and some vases\r\non the mantelpiece rose a confection of walnut and silvered glass. A\r\nmahogany chiffonier filled the side of the room farthest from the\r\nwindow; it had a marble top and a large mirror framed in scroll work,\r\nand was littered with salt-cellars, fruit plates, and silver nicknacks.\r\nThe table, a square one, was covered by a red cloth of flannel-like\r\ntexture patterned in black. The chairs were of mahogany and horsehair,\r\nand matched the sofa, which stretched from the door nearly to the\r\nwindow. Several prints framed in gilt and oak depended by means of\r\nstout green cord from French nails with great earthenware heads. In the\r\nrecess to the left of the hearth stood a piano, open, and a song on the\r\nmusic-stand. What distinguished the room from others of its type was\r\na dwarf bookcase filled chiefly with French novels whose vivid yellow\r\ngratefully lightened a dark corner next the door.\r\n\r\n"Uncle is very forgetful," the girl began. There was some sewing on the\r\ntable, and she had already taken it up. Richard felt shy and ill at\r\nease, but his companion showed no symptom of discomposure. He smiled\r\nvaguely, not knowing what to reply.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he walks a good deal," he said at length.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he does." There was a second pause. The girl continued to sew\r\nquietly; she appeared to be indifferent whether they conversed or not.\r\n\r\n"I see you are a musician."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" She laughed, and looked at his eyes. "I sing a very little\r\nbit."\r\n\r\n"Do you sing Schubert\'s songs?"\r\n\r\n"Schubert\'s? No. Are they good?"\r\n\r\n"Rather. They\'re _the_ songs."\r\n\r\n"Classical, I suppose." Her tone implied that classical songs were\r\noutside the region of the practical.\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I care much for classical music."\r\n\r\n"But you should."\r\n\r\n"Should I? Why?" She laughed gaily, like a child amused. "Hope Temple\'s\r\nsongs are nice, and \'The River of Years,\' I\'m just learning that. Do\r\nyou sing?"\r\n\r\n"No--I don\'t really sing. I haven\'t got a piano at my place--now."\r\n\r\n"What a pity! I suppose you know a great deal about music?"\r\n\r\n"I wish I did!" said Richard, trying awkwardly not to seem flattered.\r\n\r\nA third pause.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Aked seems to have a fine lot of French novels. I wish I had as\r\nmany."\r\n\r\n"Yes. He\'s always bringing them in."\r\n\r\n"And this is the latest, eh?" He picked up "L\'Abb\xe9 Tigrane," which lay\r\non the table by the sewing.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I fancy uncle got that last night."\r\n\r\n"You read French, of course?"\r\n\r\n"I! No, indeed!" Again she laughed. "You mustn\'t imagine, Mr. Larch,"\r\nshe went on, and her small eyes twinkled, "that I am at all like uncle.\r\nI\'m not. I\'ve only kept house for him a little while, and we are\r\nreally--quite different."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean, \'like uncle\'?"\r\n\r\n"Well," the quiet voice was imperceptibly raised, "I\'m not a great\r\nreader, and I know nothing of books. I\'m not clever, you know. I can\'t\r\nbear poetry."\r\n\r\nRichard looked indulgent.\r\n\r\n"But you do read?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sometimes a novel. I\'m reading \'East Lynne.\' Uncle bought it for\r\nme the other day."\r\n\r\n"And you like it?"\r\n\r\nThere was a timid tap at the door, and a short, stout servant with red\r\nhands and a red face entered; her rough, chubby forearms were bare, and\r\nshe carried a market basket. "Please, \'m," she ejaculated meaningly and\r\ndisappeared. Mr. Aked\'s niece excused herself, and when she returned\r\nRichard looked at his watch and rose.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry about uncle--but it\'s just like him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, isn\'t it?" Richard answered, and they exchanged a smile.\r\n\r\nHe walked down Carteret Street humming a tuneless air and twirling\r\nhis stick. Mr. Aked\'s niece had proved rather disappointing. She was\r\nan ordinary girl, and evidently quite unsusceptible to the artistic\r\ninfluences which subtly emanated from Mr. Aked. But with the exception\r\nof his landlady and his landlady\'s daughter, she was the first woman\r\nwhom Richard had met in London, and the interview had been somewhat of\r\nan ordeal.\r\n\r\nYes, it was matter for regret. Suppose she had been clever, witty, full\r\nof that "nameless charm" with which youths invest the ideal maidens of\r\ntheir dreams--with which, indeed, during the past week he had invested\r\nher! He might have married her. Then, guided by the experience of a\r\nsympathetic uncle-in-law, he would have realised all his ambitions. A\r\nvision of Mr. Richard Larch, the well-known editor, and his charming\r\nwife, giving a dinner-party to a carefully selected company of literary\r\ncelebrities, flitted before him. Alas! The girl\'s "East Lynne," her\r\ndrawing-room ballads, the mean little serving-maid, the complacent\r\nvulgarity of the room, the house, the street, the neighbourhood,\r\ncombined effectually to dispel it.\r\n\r\nHe felt sure that she had no aspirations.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to wait for a train at Parson\'s Green station. From\r\nthe elevated platform grass was visible through a gently falling mist.\r\nThe curving rails stole away mysteriously into a general greyness,\r\nand the twilight, assuaging every crudity of the suburban landscape,\r\ngave an impression of vast spaces and perfect serenity. Save for the\r\nporter leisurely lighting the station lamps, he was alone,--alone, as\r\nit seemed to him, in an upper world, above London, and especially above\r\nFulham and the house where lived the girl who read "East Lynne." How\r\ncommonplace must she be! Richard wondered that Mr. Aked could exist\r\nsurrounded by all the banalities of Carteret Street. Even his own\r\nlodging was more attractive, for at least Raphael Street was within\r\nsound of the central hum and beat of the city.\r\n\r\nA signal suddenly shone out in the distance; it might have been a\r\nlighthouse seen across unnumbered miles of calm ocean. Rain began to\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard\'s Sabbaths had become days of dismal torpor. A year ago, on\r\nfirst arriving in London, he had projected a series of visits to\r\nchurches famous either for architectural beauty or for picturesque\r\nritual. A few weeks, however, had brought tedium. He was fundamentally\r\nirreligious, and his churchgoing proceeded from a craving, purely\r\nsensuous, which sought gratification in ceremonial pomps, twilight\r\natmospheres heavy with incense and electric with devotion, and dim\r\nperspectives of arching stone. But these things he soon discovered lost\r\ntheir fine savour by the mere presence of a prim congregation secure in\r\nthe brass armour of self-complacency; for him the worship was spoilt\r\nby the worshippers, and so the time came when the only church which he\r\ncared to attend--and even to this he went but infrequently, lest use\r\nshould stale its charm--was the Roman Catholic oratory of St. Philip\r\nNeri, where, at mass, the separation of the sexes struck a grateful\r\nnote of austerity, and the mean appearance of the people contrasted\r\nadmirably with the splendour of the priests\' vestments, the elaborate\r\nmusic, and the gilt and colour of altars. Here deity was omnipotent\r\nand humanity abject. Men and women of all grades, casting themselves\r\ndown before the holy images in the ecstatic abandonment of repentance,\r\nprayed side by side, oblivious of everything save their sins and the\r\nanger of a God. As a spectacle the oratory was sublime.\r\n\r\nHe visited it about once a month. The mornings of intervening Sundays\r\nwere given to aimless perambulation of the parks, desultory reading,\r\nor sleep; there was nothing to prevent him leaving town for the day,\r\nbut he was so innocent of any sort of rural lore that the prospect of a\r\nfew hours in the country was seldom enticing enough to rouse sufficient\r\nenergy for its accomplishment. After dinner he usually slept, and in\r\nthe evening he would take a short walk and go early to bed. For some\r\nreason he never attempted to work on Sundays.\r\n\r\nIt had rained continuously since he left Parson\'s Green station on the\r\nprevious night, till midday on Sunday, and in the afternoon he was\r\nlounging half asleep with a volume of verse on his knee, considering\r\nwhether or not to put on his hat and go out, when Lily entered; Lily\r\nwas attired for conquest, and with her broad velvet hat and pink\r\nbows looked so unlike a servant-girl that drowsy Richard started up,\r\nuncertain what fairy was brightening his room.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, there\'s a young gentleman as wants to see you."\r\n\r\n"Oh!--who is it?" No one had ever called upon him before.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir; it\'s a young _gentleman_."\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman was ushered in. He wore a new black frock coat, and\r\nlight grey trousers which fell in rich folds over new patent-leather\r\nboots. The shortcomings of his linen, which was dull and bluish in\r\ntint, were more than atoned for by the magnificence of a new white silk\r\nnecktie with heliotrope spots. He carried a silk hat and a pair of\r\nunworn kid gloves in one hand, and in the other a half-smoked cigar and\r\na stick, with whose physiognomy Richard was quite familiar.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Jenkins!"\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon, Mr. Larch. I was just passing this way, and I thought\r\nI\'d look you up." With an inclination of the head more ridiculous even\r\nthan he intended, Jenkins placed his hat, stick, and gloves on the bed,\r\nand, nicely adjusting the tails of his coat, occupied a chair.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between Richard and Jenkins had been patched up a few days\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"So this is your digs. Nice large windows!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, decent windows."\r\n\r\nAlthough these two were on terms of almost brutal familiarity during\r\noffice hours, here each felt slightly uncomfortable in the other\'s\r\npresence. Jenkins wiped his pallid, unhealthy face with a cambric\r\nhandkerchief which he unfolded for the purpose.\r\n\r\n"Been to church this morning?"\r\n\r\nMeditatively Jenkins flicked some cigar-ash into the fire-grate, and\r\nthen answered, "Yes."\r\n\r\n"I thought so."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because you\'re such a swell."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t I, just!" Jenkins spoke with frank delight. "Two guineas the\r\nsuit, my boy! Won\'t I knock \'em in the Wal--worth Road!"\r\n\r\n"But where\'s your ring?" Richard asked, noticing the absence of the\r\nsilver ring which Jenkins commonly wore on his left hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I gave it to my sister. She wanted to give it to her young man."\r\n\r\n"She\'s engaged, is she?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--at least I suppose she is."\r\n\r\n"And when are you going to get engaged?"\r\n\r\nJenkins emitted a sound expressive of scorn. "You don\'t catch me\r\nentering the holy bonds. Not this child! It ain\'t all lavender, you\r\nbet. I say, you know Miss Roberts at the veg--red-haired tart." Jenkins\r\nwas unaware that Richard had been going regularly to the Crabtree. "I\r\nwas passing the place last night just as they were closing, and I\r\nwalked down to Charing Cross with her. I asked her to meet me to-day\r\nsomewhere, but she couldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"You mean she wouldn\'t. Well, and what sort\'s she?"\r\n\r\n"Devilish nice, _I_ tell you. But not my style. But there\'s a girl\r\nI know--lives down the Camberwell New Road. She is a treat now,--a\r\nfair treat. About seventeen, and plump as a pigeon. I shall see her\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!" said Richard, for the hundredth time marvelling that he\r\nshould be on a footing of intimacy with Albert Jenkins. The girl at\r\nCarteret Street, whatever her imperfections, did not use the Cockney\r\ndialect. And her smile was certainly alluring. Moreover, she had\r\ndignity. True, she liked "East Lynne" and Hope Temple\'s songs, but\r\nit occurred to Richard that it might be pleasanter to listen even to\r\nthese despised melodies than to remain solitary at Raphael Street or\r\nto accompany Jenkins on a _prowl_. Why should he not go down that\r\nafternoon to see Mr. Aked--and his niece? He immediately decided that\r\nhe would do so.\r\n\r\n"It\'s turned out fine," said Jenkins. "What are you up to to-night?\r\nWill you come and have a turn round with me?"\r\n\r\n"Let me see.... The fact is, I can\'t." He fought desperately against\r\nthe temptation to mention that he proposed to call on a lady, but in\r\nvain. Forth it must come. "I\'m going to see a girl."\r\n\r\n"Aha!" exclaimed Jenkins, with a terribly arch look. "So that\'s the\r\nlittle game, eh! Who\'s the mash?"\r\n\r\nRichard smiled reticently.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll be off." Jenkins rose, and his eye caught Richard\'s little\r\nbookcase; he scanned the titles of the volumes.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Likewise ah! Zola! Now we\'re getting at the secret. No wonder\r\nyou\'re so damn studious. Zola, indeed! Well, so long. See you\r\nto-morrow. Give my love to the girl.... I say, I suppose you haven\'t\r\ngot Zola in English, have you?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Never mind. So long."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little red-armed servant beamed an amiable recognition.\r\n\r\n"Very hot day!" Richard said.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, sir."\r\n\r\n"Very hot day," rather louder. They were in the passage.\r\n\r\nThe door of the sitting-room opened, and Mr. Aked\'s niece stood before\r\nhim, her finger on her lips and her eyebrows raised in a gesture of\r\nwarning. She suddenly smiled, almost laughed. Richard remembered that\r\nsmile for a long time afterwards. It transformed not only a girl\'s\r\nface, but the whole of Carteret Street. He had never seen anything like\r\nit. Shaking hands in silence, he followed her into the room, and she\r\ngently closed the door.\r\n\r\n"Uncle\'s not well," she explained. "He\'s asleep now, and I don\'t\r\nwant you to wake him. In this house, you know, if any one speaks in\r\nthe passage, you can hear it even in the attic. Uncle was caught in\r\nthe rain last night; he has a very weak chest, and gets bronchitis\r\ndirectly."\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully sorry I disturbed you," said Richard. "The fact is I\r\nwas down this way, and I thought I\'d call." It sounded a sufficiently\r\nreasonable excuse, he considered. "I hope you weren\'t asleep too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was dozing in this chair." She put her head back, and drummed\r\nwith her fingers lightly on the arms of the chair. "But I\'m glad you\'ve\r\ncalled."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Because one wants to see some one--some one new, especially after\r\nbeing in a sick-room."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been sitting up late." His tone was accusing. It seemed to him\r\nthat somehow they were already intimate.\r\n\r\n"Only till three o\'clock, and I slept later this morning. How\r\nchangeable the sun is to-day!" She moved her chair, and he saw her\r\nin profile. Her hands were on her lap. She coaxed a foot stool into\r\nposition with her toes, and placed her feet on it.\r\n\r\n"You look just like a picture in this week\'s \'Illustrated London\r\nNews\'--I mean in general pose," he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Do I? How nice that sounds! What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Whistler\'s \'Portrait of his Mother.\' But I hope you don\'t think I\r\nthink you look old."\r\n\r\n"How old do I look?" She turned her head slightly towards him.\r\n\r\n"About twenty-three, only I imagine you\'re much younger."\r\n\r\nAlthough she did not reply, she made no pretence of being annoyed, nor\r\ndid Richard tax himself with a _gaucherie_.\r\n\r\n"It took me years to like Whistler\'s pictures," she said; and in\r\nresponse to Richard\'s surprised question she was beginning to explain\r\nthat a large part of her life had been passed in the companionship of\r\nworks of graphic art, when a slippered step was heard in the hall and\r\nsome one fumbled with the door-handle. Mr. Aked entered.\r\n\r\n"Uncle! You wicked old man!" She sprang up, flushed, and her eyes\r\nsparkled angrily. "Whatever did you get up for? It\'s enough to kill\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself, my child. I got up because I didn\'t want to stay in\r\nbed,--exactly that." Mr. Aked paused to take breath and sank into a\r\nchair. "Larch, I heard your voice in the passage. Upon my word, I\r\nquite forgot you yesterday. I suppose Adeline\'s been telling you I\'m\r\nseriously ill, eh? Ah! I\'ve had many a worse attack than this. Put that\r\nantimacassar over my shoulders, child."\r\n\r\nHe had given Richard a hot, limp hand, on which the veins formed soft\r\nridges in the smooth, brittle skin. His grey hair was disarranged, and\r\nhe wore a dirty, torn dressing-gown. His face had lost its customary\r\nalert expression; but his sunk, shining eyes glanced with mysterious\r\nrestlessness first at Richard, then at Adeline, who, uttering no\r\nfurther word, covered him well and put the hassock under his feet.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, well!" he sighed and closed his eyes wearily. The other\r\ntwo sat silent for a time; then Adeline, talking very quietly, and\r\nwith a composure not quite unaffected, took up their interrupted\r\nconversation. Richard gathered that her justifiable vexation would\r\nremain in abeyance till he had gone. Soon her tone grew more natural;\r\nshe leaned forward with hands clasped round one knee, and Richard felt\r\nlike a receiver of confidences as she roughly outlined her life in the\r\ncountry which had come to an end only two years ago. Were all the girls\r\nso simply communicative, he wondered; it pleased him to decide that\r\nthey were not, and that to any other but himself she would have been\r\nmore reserved; that there was, in fact, an affinity between them. But\r\nthe presence of her uncle, which Adeline seemed able to ignore utterly,\r\nhindered Richard from being himself.\r\n\r\n"How do you like London, after living so long in the country?" he asked\r\ninevitably.\r\n\r\n"I know practically nothing of London, real London," she said; "but I\r\nthink these suburbs are horrid,--far duller than the dullest village.\r\nAnd the people! They seem so uninteresting, to have no character!"\r\n\r\nThe hoarse, fatigued voice of Mr. Aked crept in between them. "Child!"\r\nhe said--and he used the appellation, not with the proper dignity of\r\nage, but rather like an omniscient schoolboy, home for the holiday,\r\naddressing a sister--"Child!"--his eyes were still closed,--"the\r\nsuburbs, even Walham Green and Fulham, are full of interest, for those\r\nwho can see it. Walk along this very street on such a Sunday afternoon\r\nas to-day. The roofs form two horrible, converging straight lines I\r\nknow, but beneath there is character, individuality, enough to make\r\nthe greatest book ever written. Note the varying indications supplied\r\nby bad furniture seen through curtained windows, like ours" (he\r\ngrinned, opened his eyes, and sat up); "listen to the melodies issuing\r\nlamely from ill-tuned pianos; examine the enervated figures of women\r\nreclining amidst flower-pots on narrow balconies. Even in the thin\r\nsmoke ascending unwillingly from invisible chimney-pots, the flutter\r\nof a blind, the bang of a door, the winking of a fox terrier perched\r\non a window-sill, the colour of paint, the lettering of a name,--in\r\nall these things there is character and matter of interest,--truth\r\nwaiting to be expounded. How many houses are there in Carteret Street?\r\nSay eighty. Eighty theatres of love, hate, greed, tyranny, endeavour;\r\neighty separate dramas always unfolding, intertwining, ending,\r\nbeginning,--and every drama a tragedy. No comedies, and especially no\r\nfarces! Why, child, there is more character within a hundred yards of\r\nthis chair than a hundred Balzacs could analyse in a hundred years."\r\n\r\nAll the old vivacity had returned to his face; he had been rhetorical\r\non a favourite subject, and he was frankly pleased with himself.\r\n\r\n"You will tire yourself, uncle," said Adeline. "Shall we have tea?"\r\n\r\nRichard observed with astonishment that she was cold and unmoved.\r\nSurely she could not be blind to the fact that Mr. Aked was a very\r\nremarkable man with very remarkable ideas! Why, by the way, had those\r\nideas never presented themselves to _him_? He would write an article\r\non the _character_ of Raphael Street. Unwillingly he announced that he\r\nmust go; to remain longer would be to invite himself to tea.\r\n\r\n"Sit still, Larch. You\'ll have a cup of tea."\r\n\r\nAdeline left the room; and when she had gone, Mr. Aked, throwing a\r\nglance after her, said,--\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you think of my notions of the suburb?"\r\n\r\n"They are splendid," Richard replied, glowing.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something in them, I imagine," he agreed complacently. "I\'ve\r\nhad an idea lately of beginning to scribble again. I know there\'s a\r\nbook waiting to be written on \'The Psychology of the Suburbs,\' and I\r\ndon\'t like to see copy lying about wasted. The old war-horse scenting\r\nthe battle, you understand." He smiled grandiosely. "\'Psychology of the\r\nSuburbs\'! Fine title that! See how the silent _P_ takes away all the\r\ncrudity of the alliteration; that\'s because one never listens to words\r\nwith the ears alone, but with the eyes also.... But I should need help.\r\nI want a clever chap who can take down from dictation, and assist me in\r\nthe details of composition. I suppose you wouldn\'t care to come here\r\ntwo or three evenings a week?"\r\n\r\nRichard answered sincerely that nothing would suit him better.\r\n\r\n"I should make you joint author, of course. \'Psychology of the\r\nSuburbs,\' by Richard Aked and Richard Larch. It sounds rather catchy,\r\nand I think it ought to sell. About four hundred octavo pages, say\r\na hundred thousand words. Six shillings--must be popular in price.\r\nWe might get a royalty of ninepence a copy if we went to the right\r\npublisher. Sixpence for me and threepence for you. Would that do?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, perfectly!" But was not Mr. Aked running on rather fast?\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we\'d better say fivepence halfpenny for me and threepence\r\nhalfpenny for you; that would be fairer. Because you\'ll have to\r\nfurnish ideas, you know. \'Psychology of the Suburbs, Psychology of the\r\nSuburbs\'! Fine title! We ought to do it in six months."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll be quite well again soon. Then we--"\r\n\r\n"Quite well!" he repeated sharply. "I shall be as right as a trivet\r\nto-morrow. You don\'t suppose that I can\'t take care of myself! We\'ll\r\nstart at once."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not forgetting, Mr. Aked, that you\'ve never seen any of my\r\nstuff yet? Are you sure I shall be able to do what you want?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll do. I\'ve not seen your stuff, but I guess you\'ve got the\r\nliterary habit. The literary habit, that\'s the thing! I\'ll soon put you\r\nup to the wrinkles, the trade secrets."\r\n\r\n"What is your general plan of the book?" Richard asked with some\r\ntimidity, fearing to be deemed either stupid or inquisitive at the\r\nwrong moment. He had tried to say something meet for a great occasion,\r\nand failed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll go into that at our first formal conference, say next\r\nFriday night. Speaking roughly, each of the great suburban divisions\r\nhas, for me at any rate, its own characteristics, its peculiar moral\r\nphysiognomy." Richard nodded appreciatively. "Take me blindfold to\r\nany street in London, and I\'ll discover instantly, from a thousand\r\nhints, where I am. Well, each of these divisions must be described in\r\nturn, not topographically of course, but the inner spirit, the soul\r\nof it. See? People have got into a way of sneering at the suburbs.\r\nWhy, the suburbs _are_ London! It is alone the--the concussion of\r\nmeeting suburbs in the centre of London that makes the city and West\r\nEnd interesting. We could show how the special characteristics of the\r\ndifferent suburbs exert a subtle influence on the great central spots.\r\nTake Fulham; no one thinks anything of Fulham, but suppose it were\r\nswept off the face of the earth the effect would be to alter, for the\r\nseeing eye, the character of Piccadilly and the Strand and Cheapside.\r\nThe play of one suburb on another and on the central haunts is as\r\nregular, as orderly, as calculable, as the law of gravity itself."\r\n\r\nThey continued the discussion until Adeline came in again with a tray\r\nin her hands, followed by the little red-armed servant. The two began\r\nto lay the cloth, and the cheerful rattle of crockery filled the\r\nroom....\r\n\r\n"Sugar, Mr. Larch?" Adeline was saying, when Mr. Aked, looking\r\nmeaningly at Richard, ejaculated,--\r\n\r\n"Friday then?"\r\n\r\nRichard nodded. Adeline eyed her uncle distrustfully.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, unguessed by Richard, Adeline left them alone\r\nduring most of the evening, and in her absence Mr. Aked continued to\r\ndiscourse, in vague generalities not without a specious poetical charm,\r\non the subject upon which they were to collaborate, until Richard was\r\nwholly intoxicated with its fascinating possibilities. When he left,\r\nAdeline would not allow Mr. Aked to go to the door, and went herself.\r\n\r\n"If I hadn\'t been very firm," she laughed as they were shaking hands in\r\nthe passage, "uncle would have stood talking to you in the street for\r\ngoodness knows how long, and forgotten all about his bronchitis. Oh,\r\nyou authors, I believe you are every one like babies." Richard smiled\r\nhis gratification.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Larch, Mr. Larch!" The roguish summons came after him when he was\r\nhalf-way up the street. He ran back and found her at the gate with her\r\nhands behind her.\r\n\r\n"What have you forgotten?" she questioned. He could see her face but\r\ndimly in the twilight of the gas-lamps.\r\n\r\n"I know--my umbrella," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I say you were all like--little children!" she said, as she\r\nwhipped out the umbrella and gave it to him over the gate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnxious at once to add something original to the sum of Mr. Aked\'s\r\nobservations, he purposely chose a round-about route home, through the\r\nwestern parts of Fulham and past the Salisbury hotel. It seemed to him\r\nthat the latent poetry of the suburbs arose like a beautiful vapour\r\nand filled these monotonous and squalid vistas with the scent and the\r\ncolour of violets, leaving nothing common, nothing ignoble. In the\r\nupturned eyes of a shop-girl who went by on the arm of her lover he\r\ndivined a passion as pure as that of Eug\xe9nie Grandet; on the wrinkled\r\ncountenance of an older woman he beheld only the nobility of suffering;\r\na youth who walked alone, smoking a cigarette, was a pathetic figure\r\nperhaps condemned to years of solitude in London. When there was no\r\none else to see, he saw Adeline,--Adeline with her finger on her\r\nlips, Adeline angry with her uncle, Adeline pouring out tea, Adeline\r\nreaching down his hat from the peg, Adeline laughing at the gate.\r\nThere was something about Adeline that.... How the name suited her!...\r\nHer past life, judging from the hints she had given, must have been\r\ninteresting. Perhaps that accounted for the charm which....\r\n\r\nThen he returned to the book. He half regretted that Mr. Aked should\r\nhave a hand in it at all. He could do it himself. Just as plainly as if\r\nthe idea had been his own, he saw the volume complete, felt the texture\r\nof the paper, admired the disposition of the titlepage, and the blue\r\nbuckram binding; he scanned the table of contents, and carelessly eyed\r\nthe brief introduction, which was, however, pregnant with meaning;\r\nchapter followed chapter in orderly, scientific fashion, and the\r\nlast summoned up the whole business in a few masterly and dignified\r\nsentences. Already, before a single idea had been reduced to words,\r\n"The Psychology of the Suburbs" was finished! A unique work! Other\r\nauthors had taken an isolated spot here or there in the suburbs and\r\ndissected it, but none had viewed them in their complex entirety; none\r\nhad attempted to extract from their incoherence a coherent philosophy,\r\nto deal with them sympathetically as Mr. Aked and himself had done--or\r\nrather were to do. None had suspected that the suburbs were a riddle,\r\nthe answer to which was not undiscoverable. Ah, that secret, that key\r\nto the cipher! He saw it as it might be behind a succession of veils,\r\nflimsy obstructions which just then baffled his straining sight, but\r\nwhich he would rip and rend when the moment for effort came.\r\n\r\nThe same lofty sentiments occupied his brain the next morning. He\r\npaused in the knotting of his necktie, to look out of the window,\r\nseeking even in Raphael Street some fragment of that psychology of\r\nenvironment invented by Mr. Aked. Nor did he search quite in vain. All\r\nthe phenomena of humble life, hitherto witnessed daily without a second\r\nthought, now appeared to carry some mysterious meaning which was on the\r\npoint of declaring itself. Friday, when the first formal conference\r\nwas to occur, seemed distressingly distant. But he remembered that a\r\nvery hard day\'s work, the casting and completing of a gigantic bill of\r\ncosts, awaited him at the office, and he decided to throw himself into\r\nit without reserve; the time would pass more quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery solicitor\'s office has its great client, whose affairs,\r\nwatchfully managed by the senior partner in person, take precedence of\r\nall else, and whom every member of the staff regards with a particular\r\nrespect caught from the principals themselves. Messrs. Curpet and\r\nSmythe were London agents to the tremendous legal firm of Pontifex,\r\nof Manchester, said to enjoy the largest practice in the midlands;\r\nand they were excusably proud of the fact. One of the first lessons\r\nthat a new clerk learnt in the establishment at New Serjeant\'s Court\r\nwas that, at no matter what expenditure of time and trouble, Pontifex\r\nbusiness, comprising some scores of separate causes, must be transacted\r\nso irreproachably that old Mr. Pontifex, by repute a terrible fellow,\r\nmight never have cause of complaint. On those mornings, happily rare,\r\nwhen a querulous letter did by chance arrive from Manchester, the whole\r\noffice trembled apprehensively, and any clerk likely to be charged with\r\nnegligence began at once to consider the advisability of seeking a new\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe Pontifex bill of costs was made up annually in June. As the time\r\ndrew near for presenting it, more and more clerks were pressed into its\r\nservice, until at the last everyone found himself engaged, in one way\r\nor another, upon this colossal account.\r\n\r\nWhen Richard arrived at the office, he found the immense pile of\r\nwhite foolscap sheets upon his table, and next it the still higher\r\npile of blue sheets forming the draft bill. All was finished except\r\nthe checking of the figures and the final castings. As the cashier\r\nand accountant, he was ultimately responsible for this. He parcelled\r\nout the sheets, keeping the largest share for himself, and the work\r\nbegan. In every room there was a low muttering of figures, broken\r\nby an occasional oath when someone happened to lose the thread of\r\nan addition. The principals hovered about, full of solicitude and\r\nencouragement, and, according to custom on such occasions, lunch was\r\nserved on the premises at the firm\'s expense. Richard continued to\r\nadd while eating, keeping his head clear and seldom making a mistake;\r\nnothing existed for him but the column of pounds, shillings, and pence\r\nunder his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe pile of finished sheets grew, and soon the office boys, commanded\r\nby Jenkins, were passing the earlier portion of the bill through\r\nthe copying-press. As the hours went by, the helpers from other\r\ndepartments, no longer required, went back to their own neglected\r\nduties, and Richard did the last additions alone. At length the bill\r\nwas absolutely finished, and he carried it himself to the stationer\'s\r\nto be sewed. In half an hour it came back, and he laid it ceremoniously\r\nbefore Mr. Curpet. The grand total went round the office, leaping\r\nfrom lip to lip like the result of an important parliamentary poll.\r\nIt was higher than in any previous year by nearly a thousand pounds.\r\nEach of the clerks took a personal pride in its bigness, and secretly\r\ndetermined to petition for an increase of salary at the first\r\nopportunity. They talked together in groups, discussing details, while\r\na comfortable lassitude spread from room to room.\r\n\r\nRichard stood by the open window, absently watching the pigeons and the\r\ncleaners at the Law Courts opposite. In a corner an office boy, new to\r\nhis work, was stamping envelopes with slow precision. Jenkins, with one\r\nfoot on a table, was tying a shoe lace. It had struck six ten minutes\r\nago, and everyone was gone except Mr. Smythe, whose departure Jenkins\r\nawaited with impatience. The hot day subsided slowly to a serene and\r\nlovely evening, and the customary noises of the Strand ascended to\r\nRichard like the pastoral hum of a valley to a dweller on a hill, not\r\nbreaking but rather completing the stillness of the hour. Gradually his\r\nbrain freed itself from the obsession of figures, though he continued\r\nto muse vaguely over the bill, which had just been posted. It would\r\ncertainly be settled by cheque within a week, for Messrs. Pontifex were\r\ninvariably prompt. That cheque, which he himself would enter and pay\r\ninto the bank, amounted to as much as he could earn in twenty years,\r\nif he remained a clerk. He tried to imagine the scene in which, at\r\nsome future date, he would give Mr. Curpet notice of his intention to\r\nresign his position, explaining that he preferred to support himself by\r\nliterature. The ineffable sweetness of such a triumph! Could he ever\r\nrealise it? He could, he must; the alternative of eternal clerkship\r\nwas not to be endured. His glance fell on Jenkins. That poor, gay,\r\ncareless, vulgar animal would always be a clerk. The thought filled him\r\nwith commiseration, and also with pride. Fancy Jenkins writing a book\r\ncalled "The Psychology of the Suburbs"!\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to smoke," Jenkins said; "be blowed to Bertie dear." (Mrs.\r\nSmythe had once addressed her husband in the office as "Bertie dear,"\r\nand thenceforth that had been his name among the staff.) Richard made\r\nno answer. When a minute later Jenkins, discreetly directing his puffs\r\nto the open window, asked him for the titles of one or two of Zola\'s\r\nnovels in English, and their price, he gave the required information\r\nwithout turning round and in a preoccupied tone. It was his wish\r\nat that moment to appear dreamy. Perhaps a hint of the intellectual\r\ndifference between them would suggest itself even to Jenkins. Suddenly\r\na voice that seemed to be Mr. Smythe\'s came from the other side of the\r\nglass partition which separated the room from the general corridor.\r\n\r\n"Jenkins, what the devil do you mean by smoking in the office?"\r\nThe pipe vanished instantly, and Jenkins faced his accuser in some\r\nconfusion, only to find that he had been victimised. It was Mr. Aked.\r\n\r\n"You\'re as gassy as ever, I see," Jenkins said with a shade of\r\nannoyance. Mr. Aked laughed, and then began to cough badly, bending\r\nforward with flushed cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Surely you shouldn\'t have left the house to-day," Richard said,\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" The retort was almost fierce.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not fit."\r\n\r\n"Fiddlesticks! I\'ve only got a bit of a cough."\r\n\r\nRichard wondered what he had called for.\r\n\r\nJenkins began to discuss with him the shortcomings of Mr. Smythe as an\r\nemployer, and when that fruitful subject had been exhausted there was a\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Coming home?" Mr. Aked asked Richard, who at once prepared to leave.\r\n\r\n"By the way, Larch, how\'s the mash?" Jenkins wore his archest manner.\r\n\r\n"What mash?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the girl you said you were going to see yesterday afternoon."\r\n\r\n"I never said--" Richard began, looking nervously towards Mr. Aked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, of course not. Do you know, Mr. Aked, he\'s begun his little\r\ngames with the women. These fellows from the country--so shy and all\r\nthat--they\'re regular cautions when you come to know them." But Mr.\r\nAked made no response.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking you might as well come down to-morrow night instead of\r\nFriday," he said quietly to Richard, who had busied himself with the\r\nlocking of a safe.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow? Certainly, I shall be very glad," Richard answered.\r\nEvidently Mr. Aked was as eager as himself to make a beginning of the\r\nbook. No doubt that was why he had called. Surely, together they would\r\naccomplish something notable!\r\n\r\nJenkins had climbed on a lofty stool. He gave vent to a whistle,\r\nand the other two observed that his features were twisted into an\r\nexpression of delirious mirth.\r\n\r\n"Aha! aha!" he grinned, looking at Richard. "I begin to perceive.\r\nYou\'re after the pretty niece, eh, Master Larch? And a nice plump\r\nlittle thing she is, too! She came here once to fetch uncle home."\r\n\r\nMr. Aked sprang instantly forward and cuffed Jenkins\' ear.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the first time I\'ve had to do that, nor the second," he said.\r\n"I suppose you never will learn to behave yourself." Jenkins could\r\neasily have thrashed the old man--he really looked old to-day--and no\r\nconsideration for the latter\'s age would have restrained him from doing\r\nso, had not the habit of submission acquired during those years when\r\nMr. Aked ruled the outer office proved stronger than his rage. As it\r\nwas, he took up a safe position behind the stool and contented himself\r\nwith words.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a beauty, you are!" he began. "How\'s the red-haired A. B. C.\r\ngirl getting on? You know, the one that lost her place at the Courts\'\r\nrestaurant through you. If she hadn\'t been a fool, she\'d have brought\r\nan action for breach of promise. And how many more are there? I\r\nwonder--"\r\n\r\nMr. Aked made an uncertain dart after him, but he vanished through\r\nthe doorway, only to encounter Mr. Smythe. With a rather servile "\'d\r\nafternoon, sir," to the latter, Mr. Aked walked rapidly out of the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n"What the devil are you all up to?" Mr. Smythe inquired crossly. "Is\r\nAked after money, Larch?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, Mr. Smythe. He only called to see me."\r\n\r\n"You are a friend of his, are you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I know him."\r\n\r\n"H\'m! Jenkins, come and take a letter."\r\n\r\nAs Richard hurried down into the court, he felt exceedingly angry with\r\nMr. Aked. Why could not the man be more dignified? Everyone seemed to\r\ntreat him with contempt, and the cause was not altogether obscure. He\r\nhad no dignity. Richard felt personally aggrieved.\r\n\r\nNeither of them spoke of the recent incident as they walked down to\r\nthe Temple station. Mr. Aked, indeed, said nothing; a fit of coughing\r\noccupied him. Somehow Richard\'s faith in "The Psychology of the\r\nSuburbs" had lessened a little during the last half-hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Mr. Larch?"\r\n\r\nHe distinctly made out Adeline\'s head and bust above him. Her white\r\napron was pressed against the bannisters, as with extended arms and\r\nhands grasping the stair-rail she leaned over to see who was below.\r\n\r\n"It is, Miss Aked," he answered. "The door was open, and so I walked\r\nin. Is anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just sent Lottie out for the doctor. Uncle is very ill. I wish\r\nyou\'d see that he comes at once. It\'s in the Fulham Road, a little to\r\nthe left--you\'ll notice the red lamp."\r\n\r\nAs Richard ran out, he met the doctor, a youngish man with a Scots face\r\nand grey hair, hurrying down the street, the servant-girl breathless in\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\n"Master was took ill last night, sir," the latter said, in answer to\r\nRichard\'s question. "Pneumonia, the doctor says as it is, and something\r\nelse, and there\'s coming a nurse to-night. Master has attacks of it,\r\nsir--he can\'t get his breath."\r\n\r\nHe stood in the passage, uncertain what to do; the doctor had already\r\ngone upstairs.\r\n\r\n"It must be very serious," he murmured.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir." Lottie began to whimper. Richard said he would call again\r\nlater to make inquiries, and presently discovered himself in Fulham\r\nRoad, walking slowly towards Putney.\r\n\r\nMr. Aked\'s case was hopeless; of that Richard felt sure. The man must\r\nbe getting on in years, and his frame, not constitutionally vigorous,\r\nhad doubtless been fatally weakened by long-continued carelessness.\r\nWhat a strange creature of whims and enthusiasms he was! Although there\r\ncould be no question as to his age, Richard never regarded him as more\r\nthan a few years older than himself. He had none of the melancholy,\r\nthe circumspection, the fixity of view, the prudent tendency towards\r\ncompromise, the serene contented apathy, which usually mark his time of\r\nlife. He was still delicately susceptible to new influences, his ideals\r\nwere as fluid as Richard\'s own. Life had taught him scarcely anything,\r\nand least of all sagacity and a dignified carriage. He was the typical\r\nbachelor, whose deeper feelings have never been stirred. Did regrets\r\nfor a possibly happier past, shadows of dead faces, the memory of\r\nkisses, ever ruffle his equanimity? Richard thought not. He must\r\nalways have lived in the present. But he was an artist: though somehow\r\nthe man had descended in his estimation, Richard clung to that. He\r\npossessed imagination and he possessed intellect, and he could fuse\r\nthem together. Yet he had been a failure. Viewed in certain lights,\r\nRichard admitted he was a pitiful figure. What was his true history?\r\nRichard felt instinctively that none could answer that question, even\r\nin outline, except Mr. Aked, and suddenly he discerned that the man\'s\r\nnature, apparently frank to immodesty, had its own reserves, the\r\nexistence of which few ever suspected. And when the worst was said, Mr.\r\nAked possessed originality; in an incongruous way he still retained\r\nthe na\xefve graces of youthfulness; he was inspiring, and had exerted\r\ninfluences for which Richard could not but be grateful.\r\n\r\n"The Psychology of the Suburbs" had receded swiftly into the\r\nbackground, a beautiful, impossible idea! Richard knew now that it\r\ncould never have been carried out. A little progress would have been\r\nmade, and then, as difficulties increased, both he and Mr. Aked would\r\nhave tacitly abandoned their enterprise. They were very much alike, he\r\nthought, and the fancied similarity pleased him. Perhaps at some future\r\ntime he might himself carry the undertaking to completion, in which\r\ncase he would dedicate his book to the memory of Mr. Aked. He did not\r\nregret that the dream of the last few days was ended. It had been very\r\nenjoyable, but the awakening, since according to his present wisdom\r\nit must have occurred sooner or later, was less unpleasant now than it\r\ncould have been at any more advanced stage. Moreover, it was pleasant\r\nto dream of the dream.\r\n\r\nMr. Aked was dying: he knew it from Adeline\'s tone. Poor Adeline! To\r\nwhom would she turn? She had implied that the only relatives for whom\r\nshe cared, these being on her mother\'s side, were in America. From whom\r\nwould she seek assistance? Who would conduct the formalities of the\r\nfuneral, and the testamentary business, such as it was? His loathing\r\nfor funerals seemed to have vanished, and he was not without hope that\r\nAdeline, though their acquaintance was of the shortest, might engage\r\nhis help for her helplessness. And after the funeral, what would she\r\ndo? Since she would probably have enough to live upon, she might elect\r\nto remain where she was. In which case he would visit her now and then\r\nof an evening. Her imminent loneliness gave her a pathetic charm, and\r\nhe made haste to draw a picture of himself and her on either side the\r\nfireplace talking familiarly while she knitted or sewed.\r\n\r\nYes, he was actually a grown man, and entitled to his romances. He\r\nmight eventually fall in love with her, having discovered in her\r\ncharacter rare qualities now unsuspected. It was improbable, but not\r\nimpossible, and he had, in fact, already glanced at the contingency\r\nseveral times before. Oh for a passion, a glorious infatuation, even\r\nif it ended in disaster and ruin! The difficulty was that Adeline fell\r\nshort of the ideal lover. That virginal abstraction was to have been an\r\nartist of some sort, absolutely irreligious, broad in social views, the\r\nessence of refinement, with a striking but not necessarily beautiful\r\nface, soft-spoken, and isolated--untrammelled by friends. Adeline was\r\nno artist; he feared she might be a regular attendant at chapel and\r\npainfully orthodox as to the sexual relations. Was she refined? Had\r\nshe a striking face? He said Yes, twice. Her voice was low and full of\r\npretty modulations. Soon, perhaps, she would be alone in the world. If\r\nonly she had been an artist.... That deficiency, he was afraid, would\r\nprove fatal to any serious attachment. Still, it would be good to visit\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHe was crossing Putney Bridge. Night had fallen, and the full brilliant\r\nmoon showed a narrow stream crawling between two broad flats of mud.\r\nJust below the bridge a barge lay at anchor; the silhouette of a man\r\nmoved leisurely about on it, and then a boat detached itself from the\r\nstem of the barge and dropped down river into darkness. On the bridge\r\nbusses and waggons rattled noisily. Young men with straw hats and\r\ngirls in white blouses and black skirts passed to and fro in pairs,\r\nsome chattering, some silent. The sight of these couples gave Richard\r\nan idea for the abandoned "Psychology of the Suburbs." What if Mr. Aked\r\nrecovered? He remembered his sister telling him that their grandfather\r\nhad survived after having been three times surrendered to death by the\r\ndoctors. "The Psychology of the Suburbs" began to attract him. It might\r\ncome to completion, if Mr. Aked lived, and then.... But what about\r\nthose evenings with the lonely Adeline? The two vistas of the future\r\nclashed with and obscured each other, and he was overcome by vague\r\nforeboding. He saw Mr. Aked struggling for breath in the mean suburban\r\nbedroom, and Adeline powerless at his side. The pathos of her position\r\nbecame intolerable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to Carteret Street, it was she who came to the door.\r\n\r\n"How is he?"\r\n\r\n"About the same. The nurse has come. She told me to go to bed at once,\r\nbut I don\'t feel as if I wanted to sleep. You will sit down a little?"\r\n\r\nShe took the rocking-chair, and leaning back with a gesture of\r\nlassitude rocked gently; her white face, with the red eyes and\r\ndrooping eyelids, gave sign of excessive fatigue, and on her lips there\r\nwas a gloomy pout. After she had described Mr. Aked\'s condition in some\r\ndetail and told what the doctor had said, they sat silent for a while\r\nin that tense atmosphere which seems to stifle vitality in a house of\r\ndangerous sickness. Overhead the nurse moved about, making the window\r\nrattle softly now and then.\r\n\r\n"You have known uncle a long time, haven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," Richard answered. "It\'s a very funny thing, but though I\r\nseem to know him quite well, I\'ve not met him half a dozen times in my\r\nlife. I saw him first about a year ago, and then I met him again the\r\nother day at the British Museum, and after we\'d had dinner together we\r\nwere just like old friends."\r\n\r\n"I certainly thought from what he said that you _were_ old friends.\r\nUncle has so few friends. Except one or two neighbours I do believe you\r\nare the first person that has ever called at this house since I came to\r\nlive here."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, we have soon got to know each other," said Richard,\r\nsmiling. "It isn\'t a week since you asked me if my name was Larch." She\r\nreturned the smile, though rather mechanically.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps my mistake about your being an old friend of Uncle Aked\'s\r\nexplains that," she said.\r\n\r\n"Well, we won\'t bother about explaining it; there it is, and if I can\r\nhelp you in any way just now, you must tell me."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I will." She said it with perfect simplicity. Richard was\r\nconscious of a scarcely perceptible thrill.\r\n\r\n"You must have had an awful time last night, all alone," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I was too annoyed to feel upset."\r\n\r\n"Annoyed?"\r\n\r\n"Because uncle has brought it all on himself by carelessness. I do\r\nthink it\'s a shame!" She stopped rocking, and sat up, her face full of\r\nserious protest.\r\n\r\n"He\'s not the sort of man to take care of himself. He never thought--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. He should have thought, at his age. If he dies, he\r\nwill practically have killed himself, yes, killed himself. There\'s no\r\nexcuse, going out as he did, in spite of all I said. Fancy him coming\r\ndownstairs last Sunday in the state he was, and then going out on\r\nMonday, though it _was_ warm!"\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ll hope he will get better, and it may be a lesson to him."\r\n\r\n"Hark! What was that?" She sprang to her feet apprehensively and\r\nlistened, her breast pulsing beneath the tight black bodice and her\r\nstartled inquiring eyes fixed on Richard\'s. A very faint tinkle came\r\nfrom the rear of the house.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the front-door bell," he suggested.\r\n\r\n"Of course. How silly of me! I fancied.... Who can it be at this time?"\r\nShe went softly into the passage. Richard heard the door open, and then\r\na woman\'s voice, which somehow seemed familiar,--\r\n\r\n"How is Mr. Aked to-night? Your servant told our servant that he was\r\nill, and I felt anxious."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Adeline exclaimed, discomposed for a moment, as it seemed to\r\nRichard; then she went on coldly, "Uncle is about the same, thank you,"\r\nand almost immediately closed the door.\r\n\r\n"A person to inquire about uncle," she said to Richard, with a peculiar\r\nintonation, on re-entering the room. Then, just as he was saying that\r\nhe must go, there was a knock on the ceiling and she flew away again.\r\nRichard waited in the passage till she came downstairs.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing. I thought he was dying! Oh!" and she began to cry freely\r\nand openly, without attempting to wipe her eyes.\r\n\r\nRichard gazed hard at the apron string loosely encircling her waist;\r\nfrom that white line her trembling bust rose like a bud from its calyx,\r\nand below it the black dress flowed over her broad hips in gathered\r\nfolds; he had never seen a figure so exquisite, and the beauty of it\r\ntook a keener poignancy from their solitude in the still, anxious\r\nnight--the nurse and the sick man were in another sphere.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t you better go to bed?" he said. "You must be tired out and\r\nover-excited." How awkward and conventional the words sounded!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Adeline\'s idiosyncrasy there was a subtle, elusive suggestion of\r\nsingularity, of unexpectedness, which Richard in spite of himself found\r\nvery alluring, and he correctly attributed it, in some degree, to the\r\npeculiar circumstances of her early life, an account of which, with\r\ncharacteristic quaintness, she had given him at their second meeting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe posthumous child of Richard Aked\'s brother, Adeline, who had\r\nno recollection of her mother, lived at first with her maternal\r\ngrandparents and two uncles. She slept alone at the top of the house,\r\nand when she arose in the morning from the big bed with its red\r\ncurtains and yellow tassels, she always ran to the window. Immediately\r\nbelow here were the leads which roofed the great projecting windows\r\nof the shop. It was her practice at night to scatter crumbs on the\r\nleads, and sometimes she would be early enough to watch the sparrows\r\npecking them; more often all the crumbs had vanished while she was\r\nyet asleep. The Square never failed to interest her in the morning.\r\nIn the afternoon it seemed torpid and morose; but before dinner,\r\nmore especially on Saturdays and Mondays, it was gaily alert--full\r\nof canvas-covered stalls, and horses and carts, and heaped piles of\r\nvegetables, and pigs grunting amidst straw, and rough rosy-faced men,\r\ntheir trousers tied at the knees with string, who walked about heavily,\r\ncracking whips. These things arrived mysteriously, before the sun, and\r\nin the afternoon they dwindled imperceptibly away; the stalls were\r\nunthatched, the carts jolted off one by one, and the pigs departed\r\nsqueaking, until at five o\'clock the littered Square was left deserted\r\nand forlorn. Now and again a new stall, unfolding vivid white canvas,\r\nstood out brightly amid its soiled companions; then Adeline would\r\nrun downstairs to her favourite uncle, who had breakfast at 7.30 so\r\nthat he might be in charge of the shop while the rest were at table:\r\n"Uncle Mark, Uncle Mark, there is a new stall up at the top of the\r\nSquare, near the New Inn!" "Perhaps it is only an old one with its face\r\nwashed," Uncle Mark would say; and Adeline, raising her right shoulder,\r\nwould put her head on it and laugh, screwing up her eyes.\r\n\r\nIn those days she was like a little Puritan girl, with her plain\r\nfrocks and prim gait. Her black hair, confined by a semicircular comb\r\nwhich stretched from ear to ear over the top of her head, was brushed\r\nstraight away from her forehead, and fell across the entire width\r\nof her shoulders in glossy, wavy lines. Her grey eyes were rather\r\nlarge, except when she laughed, and they surveyed people with a frank,\r\ninquiring look which frightened some of the commercial travellers who\r\ncame into the shop and gave her threepenny bits; it seemed as if all\r\none\'s secret shames stood revealed to that artless gaze. Her nose was\r\nshort and flattened, but her mouth happened to be perfect, of exactly\r\nthe classic form and size, with delectable lips half hiding the small\r\nwhite teeth.\r\n\r\nTo her the house appeared to be of immense proportions; she had been\r\ntold that once, before she was born, it was three houses. Certainly it\r\npossessed more than the usual number of staircases, and one of these,\r\nwith the single room to which it gave access, was always closed. From\r\nthe Square, the window of the disused chamber, obscured and bare,\r\ncontrasted strangely with the clear panes, white blinds, and red pads\r\nof the others. This room was next to her own, the two staircases\r\nrunning parallel; and the thought of its dread emptiness awed her at\r\nnights. One Saturday night in bed she discovered that grandma, who had\r\nbeen plaiting her hair for Sunday, had left a comb sticking in it. She\r\ncalled aloud to grandma, to Uncle Mark, to Uncle Luke, in vain. None\r\nof them came to her; but she distinctly heard an answering cry from the\r\nshut room. She ceased to call, and lay fearfully quiet for a while;\r\nthen it was morning, and the comb had slipped out of her hair and down\r\ninto the bed.\r\n\r\nBeneath the house were many cellars. One served for kitchen, and\r\nAdeline had a swing there, hung from a beam; two others were larders;\r\na fourth held coal, and in a fifth ashes were thrown. There were yet\r\ntwo more under the shop, to be reached by a separate flight of stone\r\nsteps. Uncle Mark went down those steps every afternoon to turn on the\r\ngas, but he would never allow Adeline to go with him. Grandma, indeed,\r\nwas very cross if, when the door leading to the steps happened to be\r\nopen, Adeline approached within a yard of it. Often, chattering to the\r\nshop-girls, who at quiet times of the day clustered round the stove\r\nwith their sewing, she would suddenly think of the cellars below, and\r\nher heart would seem to stop.\r\n\r\nIf the shutters were up, the shop was even more terribly mysterious\r\nthan either the cellars or the disused room. On Sunday afternoons,\r\nwhen grandpa snored behind a red and yellow handkerchief in the\r\nbreakfast-room, it was necessary for Adeline to go through the shop\r\nand up the show-room staircase, in order to reach the drawing-room,\r\nbecause to get to the house staircase would involve disturbing the\r\nsleeper. How strange the shop looked as she hurried timorously across!\r\nA dim twilight, worse than total darkness, filtered through the cracks\r\nof the shutters, showing faintly the sallow dust-sheets which covered\r\nthe merinos and the chairs on the counters, and she always reached\r\nthe show-room, which had two large, unobstructed windows, with a sob\r\nof relief. Very few customers were asked into the show-room; Adeline\r\nemployed it on weekdays as a nursery; here she nursed her dolls, flew\r\nkites, and read "Little Wideawake," a book given to her by a commercial\r\ntraveller; there was a cheval glass near the front window in which she\r\ncontemplated herself long and seriously.\r\n\r\nShe never had the companionship of other children, nor did she desire\r\nit. Other children, she understood, were rude and dirty; although\r\nUncle Mark and Uncle Luke taught in the Sunday-school, and grandpa\r\nhad once actually been superintendent, she was not allowed to go\r\nthere, simply because the children were rude and dirty. But she went\r\nto morning chapel, sitting alone with grandpa on the red cushions of\r\nthe broad pew, that creaked every time she moved; Uncle Mark and Uncle\r\nLuke sat away up in the gallery with the rude and dirty Sunday-school\r\nchildren; grandma seldom went to chapel; the ministers called to see\r\nher instead. Once to her amazement Uncle Luke had ascended the pulpit\r\nstairs, looking just as if he was walking in his sleep, and preached.\r\nIt seemed so strange, and afterwards the religious truths which she had\r\nbeen taught somehow lost their awfulness and some of their reality. On\r\nSunday evenings she celebrated her own private service, in which she\r\nwas preacher, choir, organist, and congregation. Her extempore prayers\r\nwere the secret admiration of grandma, who alone heard them. Adeline\r\nstayed up for supper on Sundays. When the meal was over, grandpa opened\r\nthe big Bible, and in his rich, heavy voice read that Shem begat\r\nArphaxad and Arphaxad begat Salah and Salah begat Eber and Eber begat\r\nPelag, and about the Ammonites and the Jebusites and the Canaanites and\r\nthe Moabites; and then they knelt, and he prayed for them that rule\r\nover us, and widows and orphans; and at the word "orphans," grandma,\r\nwho didn\'t kneel like the others but sat upright in her rocking-chair\r\nwith one hand over her eyes, would say "Amen, Amen," under her breath.\r\nAnd after it was all over Adeline would choose whether Uncle Mark or\r\nUncle Luke should carry her to bed.\r\n\r\nGrandpa died, and then grandma, and Aunt Grace (who was not an aunt\r\nat all, but a cousin) came to stay with Adeline and her uncles, and\r\none day the shutters of the shop were put up and not taken down again.\r\nAdeline learnt that Uncle Mark and Uncle Luke were going a long way\r\noff, to America, and that she was to live in future with Aunt Grace in\r\na large and splendid house full of coloured pictures and statues and\r\nbooks. It seemed odd that Aunt Grace, whose dresses were rather shabby,\r\nshould have a finer house than grandpa\'s, until Uncle Mark explained\r\nthat the house did not really belong to Aunt Grace; Aunt Grace merely\r\nkept it in order for a rich young gentleman who had fifteen servants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen she had recovered from the parting with her uncles, Adeline\r\naccepted the change with docility. Long inured as she was to spiritual\r\nsolitude (for the closest friendship that can exist between a child and\r\nan adult comprises little more than an affectionate tolerance on either\r\nside, and certainly knows nothing of those intimate psychic affinities\r\nwhich attract child to child or man to man), she could not, indeed,\r\nhave easily found much hardship in the conditions of her new life. One\r\nmatter troubled her at first, namely, that Aunt Grace never prayed or\r\nread the Bible or went to chapel; nor, so far as Adeline knew, did\r\nanyone else at the Abbey. But she soon became reconciled to this state\r\nof things. For a time she continued to repeat her prayers; then the\r\nhabit ceased.\r\n\r\nThe picture-gallery, of which she had heard a great deal, fascinated\r\nher at once. It was a long but not very lofty apartment, receiving\r\ndaylight from a hidden source, hung with the finest examples of the\r\nfour great Italian schools which flourished during the first half of\r\nthe sixteenth century: the Venetian, a revel of colour; the Roman,\r\ndignified and even sedate; the Florentine, nobly grandiose; and the\r\nschool of Parma, mysteriously delicate. Opportunity serving, she spent\r\nmuch of her time here, talking busily to the madonnas, the Christs,\r\nthe martyred saints, the monarchs, the knights, the lovely ladies,\r\nand all the na\xefve medi\xe6val crowd, giving each of them a part in her\r\nown infantile romances. When she grew older, she copied--who shall\r\nsay whether consciously or unconsciously?--the attitudes and gestures\r\nof the women; and perhaps in time there passed into Adeline, by some\r\nineffable channel, at least a portion of their demure grace and\r\ncontented quietude. There were pictures also in the square library,\r\nexamples of quite modern English and French work, sagaciously chosen\r\nby one whose critical faculty had descended to him through four\r\ngenerations of collectors; but Adeline had no eyes for these. The\r\nbooks, however, gorgeous prisoners in glass, were her good friends,\r\nthough she might never touch them, and though the narrow, conventional\r\ngirl\'s education assiduously bestowed upon her by her aunt in person,\r\nstifled rather than fostered curiosity with regard to their contents.\r\n\r\nWhen Adeline was about nineteen, her guardian became engaged to be\r\nmarried to a middle-aged farmer, a tenant of the Abbey, who made it\r\nclear that in espousing Aunt Grace he was not eager to espouse Aunt\r\nGrace\'s _prot\xe9g\xe9e_ also. A serious question arose as to her future. She\r\nhad only one other relative in England, Mr. Aked, and she passively\r\naccepted his timely suggestion that she should go to London and keep\r\nhouse for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday evening Richard took tea at the Crabtree, so that he\r\nmight go down by train to Parson\'s Green direct from Charing Cross.\r\nThe coffee-room was almost empty of customers; and Miss Roberts, who\r\nappeared to be in attendance there, was reading in the "cosy corner,"\r\nan angle of the room furnished with painted mirrors and a bark bench of\r\nfictitious rusticity.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing up here?" he asked, when she brought his meal.\r\n"Aren\'t you cashier downstairs any longer?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," she said, "I should just think I was. But the girl that\r\nwaits in this room, Miss Pratt, has her half-holiday on Wednesdays,\r\nand I come here, and the governor takes my place downstairs. I do\r\nit to oblige him. He\'s a gentleman, he is. _That_ polite! I have my\r\nhalf-holiday on Fridays."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'ve nothing else to do, what do you say to pouring out my\r\ntea for me?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you pour it out yourself? Poor thing!" She smiled pityingly, and\r\nbegan to pour out the tea.\r\n\r\n"Sit down," Richard suggested.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," she said. "There! If it isn\'t sweet enough, you can\r\nput another lump in yourself;" and she disappeared behind the screen\r\nwhich hid the food-lift.\r\n\r\nPresently he summoned her to make out his check. He was debating\r\nwhether to tell her that Mr. Aked was ill. Perhaps if he did so she\r\nmight request to be informed how the fact concerned herself. He decided\r\nto say nothing, and was the more astonished when she began:\r\n\r\n"Did you know Mr. Aked was very ill?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Who told you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I live near him, a few doors away--didn\'t I tell you once?--and\r\ntheir servant told ours."\r\n\r\n"Told your servant?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss Roberts, reddening a little, and with an inflection\r\nwhich meant, "I suppose you thought _my_ family wouldn\'t have a\r\nservant!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" He stopped a moment, and then an idea came to him. "It must have\r\nbeen you who called last night to inquire!" He wondered why Adeline had\r\nbeen so curt with her.\r\n\r\n"Were you there then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I know the Akeds pretty well."\r\n\r\n"The doctor says he\'ll not get better. What do you think?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it\'s a bad lookout."\r\n\r\n"Very sad for poor Miss Aked, isn\'t it?" she said, and something in the\r\ntone made Richard look up at her.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he agreed.\r\n\r\n"Of course you like her?"\r\n\r\n"I scarcely know her--it\'s the old man I know," he replied guardedly.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you ask me, I think she\'s a bit stand-offish."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that\'s only her manner."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve noticed it too, have you?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit. I\'ve really seen very little of her."\r\n\r\n"Going down again to-night?"\r\n\r\n"I may do."\r\n\r\nNothing had passed between Adeline and himself as to his calling that\r\nday, but when he got to Carteret Street she evidently accepted his\r\npresence as a matter of course, and he felt glad. There was noting in\r\nher demeanour to recall the scene of the previous night. He did not\r\nstay long. Mr. Aked\'s condition was unchanged. Adeline had watched\r\nby him all day, while the nurse slept, and now she confessed to an\r\nindisposition.\r\n\r\n"My bones ache," she said, with an attempt to laugh, "and I feel\r\nmiserable, though under the circumstances there\'s nothing strange in\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nHe feared she might be sickening towards influenza, caught from her\r\nuncle, but said nothing, lest he should alarm her without cause. The\r\nnext day, however, his apprehension was justified. On his way to the\r\nhouse in the evening he met the doctor at the top of Carteret Street\r\nand stopped him.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a friend of Mr. Aked\'s, eh?" the doctor said, examining\r\nRichard through his gold-rimmed spectacles. "Well, go and do what\r\nyou can. Miss Aked is down with the influenza now, but I don\'t think\r\nit will be a severe attack if she takes care. The old fellow\'s state\r\nis serious. You see, he has no constitution, though perhaps that\'s\r\nscarcely a disadvantage in these cases; but when it comes to double\r\nbasic pneumonia, with fever, and cardiac complications, pulse 140,\r\nrespiration 40, temperature 103 to 104, there\'s not a great deal of\r\nchance. I\'ve got a magnificent nurse, though, and she\'ll have her hands\r\nfull. We ought really to send for another one, especially as Miss Aked\r\nwants looking after too.... Bless you," he went on, in answer to a\r\nquestion from Richard, "I can\'t say. I injected strychnia this morning,\r\nand that has given relief, but he may die during the night. On the\r\nother hand he may recover. By the way, they seem to have no relations,\r\nexcept a cousin of Mr. Aked\'s who lives in the north. I\'ve wired to\r\nher. Good evening. See what you can do. I\'m due in my surgery in two\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\nRichard introduced himself to the nurse, explained that he had seen\r\nthe doctor, and asked if he could render assistance. She was a slender\r\ngirl of about twenty-three, with dark, twinkling eyes and astonishingly\r\nsmall white ears; her blue uniform, made of the same print as a\r\nservant\'s morning-dress, fitted without a crease, and her immense\r\napron was snowy. On one linen cuff was a stain; she noticed this while\r\ntalking to Richard, and adroitly reversed the wristband under his very\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you know the Akeds pretty well?" she questioned.\r\n\r\n"Well, pretty well," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Do you know any friends of theirs, women, who happen to live near?"\r\n\r\n"I feel fairly sure they have practically no acquaintances. I have\r\nnever met any people here."\r\n\r\n"It is very awkward, now that Miss Aked is taken ill."\r\n\r\nThe mention of Adeline gave him an opportunity to make more particular\r\ninquiries as to her condition.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to be afraid of," the nurse said, "only she must stay\r\nin bed and keep quite quiet."\r\n\r\n"I fancied last night she looked ill," he said sagely.\r\n\r\n"You were here last night?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and the night before."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I wasn\'t aware--" The nurse stopped a moment. "Pardon me, if I am\r\nindiscreet, but are you engaged to Miss Aked?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Richard shortly, uncertain whether or not he was blushing.\r\nThe nurse\'s eyes twinkled, but otherwise her impassive gravity suffered\r\nno diminishment. "Not at all," he added. "I am merely a friend, anxious\r\nto do anything I can."\r\n\r\n"I will get you to do some marketing for me," she decided suddenly.\r\n"The maid is sitting with Mr. Aked--he\'s a little easier for the\r\nmoment--and Miss Aked, I think, is asleep. If I give you a list, can\r\nyou discover the shops? I am quite ignorant of this neighbourhood."\r\n\r\nRichard thought he could discover the shops.\r\n\r\n"In the meantime I will have a bath. I have had no rest worth\r\nmentioning for twenty-four hours, and I want freshening up. Don\'t come\r\nback for twenty minutes, or there will be no one to let you in. Stay,\r\nI will give you the latch-key." It was attached to her chatelaine.\r\n\r\nEquipped with written orders and a sovereign, he went out. Though he\r\nwas away barely a quarter of an hour, she was dressed and downstairs\r\nagain when he came in, her face as radiant as if she had just risen.\r\nShe counted the change, and checked the different purchases with the\r\nlist. Richard had made no mistakes.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she said very formally. He had expected a little praise.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything else I can do?" he asked, determined not to weary in\r\ngood works, however coldly his efforts were received.\r\n\r\n"I think you might sit with Mr. Aked for a while," she said; "I must\r\npositively give some attention to Miss Aked, and half an hour\'s rest\r\nwould not harm me. See, there are some slippers; would you mind taking\r\noff your boots and putting those on instead? Thank you. You may talk to\r\nMr. Aked if he talks to you, and let him hold your hand--he\'ll probably\r\nwant to. Let him have just a sip of the brandy and milk I will give\r\nyou, whenever he asks for it. Don\'t mind if he grumbles at everything\r\nyou do. Try to soothe him. Remember he is very seriously ill. Shall I\r\ntake you upstairs?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at Richard and then at the door; and Richard, hesitating\r\nfor a fraction of a second, stepped past her to open it. He managed\r\nit awkwardly because he had never done such a thing for a lady in his\r\nlife, nor could he quite understand what mysterious prompting had\r\nled him to be so punctilious now. The nurse bowed acknowledgment and\r\npreceded him to the sick-room. He felt as a student feels just before\r\nthe examination papers are handed round.\r\n\r\nA smell of linseed escaped from the bedroom as the nurse pushed open\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"Stay outside a moment," she said to Richard. He could see the grate,\r\non which a kettle was singing over a small fire. In front of the fire\r\nwas a board, with a large bowl and spoon, and some pieces of linen.\r\nThen he was conscious of nothing but a loud sound of rapid, painful\r\nbreathing, accompanied by moans and a strange rattling which came to\r\nhis ears with perturbing distinctness. He knew nothing of sickness\r\nbeyond what people had told him, and these phenomena inspired him with\r\nphysical dread. He wished to run away.\r\n\r\n"A friend of yours is coming to sit with you, Mr. Aked--you know Mr.\r\nLarch," he heard the nurse say; she was evidently busy about the bed.\r\n"You can go now, Lottie," she went on to the servant. "Wash up the\r\nthings I have put in the sink, and then off to bed."\r\n\r\nRichard waited with painful expectancy for the voice of Mr. Aked.\r\n\r\n"Larch--did you say--why--didn\'t he come--before?" The tones were\r\nless unnatural than he had anticipated, but it seemed that only by\r\nthe exercise of a desperate ingenuity could the speaker interject the\r\nfragments of a sentence here and there between his hurrying gasps.\r\n\r\nThen the servant went downstairs.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Mr. Larch," the nurse called pleasantly.\r\n\r\nThe patient, supported by pillows, was sitting upright in bed, and\r\nas Richard entered he looked towards the door with the expression of\r\nan unarmed man on the watch for an assassin. His face was drawn and\r\nduskily pale, but on each cheek burned a red flush; at every cruel\r\ninspiration the nostrils dilated widely, and the shoulders were raised\r\nin a frenzied effort to fill the embarrassed lungs.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Aked," Richard greeted him, "here I am, you see."\r\n\r\nHe made no reply beyond a weak nod, and signed to the nurse for the\r\nfeeding-cup of brandy and milk, which she held to his mouth. Richard\r\nwas afraid he might not be able to stay in the room, and marvelled\r\nthat the nurse could be unmoved and cheerful in the midst of this\r\npiteous altercation with death. Was she blind to the terror in the\r\nman\'s eyes?\r\n\r\n"You had better sit here, Mr. Larch," she said quietly, pointing to a\r\nchair by the bedside. "Here is the drink; hold the cup--so. Ring this\r\nbell if you want me for anything." Then she noiselessly disappeared.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he sat down than Mr. Aked seized his shoulder for\r\nsupport, and each movement of the struggling frame communicated itself\r\nto Richard\'s body. Richard suddenly conceived a boundless respect for\r\nthe nurse, who had watched whole nights by this tortured organism on\r\nthe bed. Somehow existence began to assume for him a new and larger\r\naspect; he felt that till that moment he had been going through the\r\nworld with his eyes closed; life was sublimer, more terrible, than\r\nhe had thought. He abased himself before all doctors and nurses and\r\nsoldiers in battle; they alone tasted the true savour of life.\r\n\r\nArt was a very little thing.\r\n\r\nPresently Mr. Aked breathed with slightly less exertion, and he\r\nappeared to doze for a few moments now and then, though Richard could\r\nscarcely believe that any semblance of sleep was possible to a man in\r\nhis condition.\r\n\r\n"Adeline?" he questioned once.\r\n\r\n"She\'s getting on fine," Richard said soothingly. "Would you like a\r\nsip?"\r\n\r\nHe put his grey lips clumsily round the lip of the cup, drank, and then\r\npushed the vessel away with a gesture of irritation.\r\n\r\nThe windows were open, but the air was perfectly still, and the gas\r\nburnt without a tremor between the windows and the door.\r\n\r\n"I\'m stifled," the patient gasped. "Are they--doing--all they can--for\r\nme?"--Richard tried to reassure him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all over--with me--Larch--I can\'t--keep it up long--I\'m\r\ngoing--going--they\'ll have to try--something else."\r\n\r\nHis lustrous eyes were fastened on Richard with an appealing gaze.\r\nRichard turned away.\r\n\r\n"I\'m frightened--I thought I shouldn\'t be--but I am. Doctor suggested\r\nparson--it\'s not that--I said no.... Do you think--I\'m dying?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," said Richard.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a lie--I\'m off.... It\'s a big thing,--death--everyone\'s\r\nafraid--of it--at last.... Instinct!... Shows there\'s something--awful\r\nbehind it."\r\n\r\nIf Richard had been murdering the man, he could not have had a sharper\r\nsense of guilt than at that moment oppressed him.\r\n\r\nMr. Aked continued to talk, but with a growing incoherence which\r\ngradually passed into delirium. Richard looked at his watch. Only\r\nthirty minutes had slipped by, and yet he felt as if his shoulder had\r\nsuffered the clutch of that hot hand since before the beginning of\r\ntime! Again he experienced the disconcerting sensation of emotional\r\nhorizons suddenly widened.\r\n\r\nPeople were walking down the street; they talked and laughed. How\r\nincongruously mirthful and careless their voices sounded! Perhaps\r\nthey had never watched by a sick-bed, never listened to the agonised\r\nbreathing of a pneumonia patient. That incessant frantic intake of\r\nair! It exasperated him. If it did not stop soon, he should go mad. He\r\nstared at the gas-flame, and the gas-flame grew larger, larger, till\r\nhe could see nothing else.... Then, after a long while, surely the\r\nbreathing was more difficult! There was a reverberating turmoil in the\r\nman\'s chest which shook the bed. Could Richard have been asleep, or\r\nwhat? He started up; but Mr. Aked clung desperately to him, raising\r\nhis shoulders higher and higher in the struggle to inhale, and leaning\r\nforward till he was bent almost double. Richard hesitated, and then\r\nstruck the bell. It seemed as if the nurse would never come. The door\r\nopened softly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he is much worse," Richard said to the nurse, striving to\r\ncover his agitation. She looked at Mr. Aked.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you had better fetch the doctor."\r\n\r\nWhen he returned, Mr. Aked was lying back unconscious.\r\n\r\n"Of course the doctor can do nothing now," said the nurse, calmly\r\nanswering the question in his eyes. "He\'ll never speak any more."\r\n\r\n"But Miss Aked?"\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be helped. I shall say nothing to her till morning."\r\n\r\n"Then she won\'t see him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. It would be madness for her to leave her bed."\r\n\r\nThe doctor arrived, and the three talked quietly together about the\r\nalarming prevalence of influenza at that time of the year, and the\r\nfatal results of carelessness.\r\n\r\n"I tell you honestly," the doctor said, "I\'m so overworked that I\r\nshould be quite satisfied to step into my coffin and not wake again.\r\nI\'ve had three 3 A. M. midwifery cases this week--forceps, chloroform,\r\nand the whole bag of tricks--on the top of all this influenza, and I\'m\r\nabout sick of it. That\'s the worst of our trade; it comes in lumps.\r\nWhat do you say, nurse?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nurse suggested that Richard should remain at Carteret Street for\r\nthe rest of the night, using the sofa in the sitting-room. Contrary\r\nto his expectation, he slept well and dreamlessly for several hours,\r\nand woke up refreshed and energetic. The summer sun was dispersing a\r\nlight mist. One thought occupied his mind,--Adeline\'s isolation and\r\nneed of succour. Mentally he enveloped her with tender solicitude; and\r\nthe prospect of giving her instant aid, and so earning her gratitude,\r\ncontributed to a mood of vigorous cheerfulness to which his sorrow for\r\nMr. Aked\'s death formed but a vague and distant background.\r\n\r\nNo one seemed to be stirring. He washed luxuriously in the little\r\nscullery, and then, silently unbolting the front door, went out for a\r\nwalk. It was just six o\'clock, and above the weazen trees which line\r\neither side of Carteret Street the sparrows were noisily hilarious. As\r\nhe strode along in the fresh, sunny air, his fancy pictured scene after\r\nscene between himself and Adeline in which he rendered a man\'s help and\r\nshe offered a woman\'s gratitude. He determined to take upon himself\r\nall the arrangements for the funeral, and looked forward pleasurably\r\nto activities from which under different circumstances he would have\r\nshrunk with dismay. He thought of Adeline\'s aunt or cousin, distant in\r\nthe north, and wondered whether she or any other relatives, if such\r\nexisted, would present themselves; he hoped that Adeline might be\r\nforced to rely solely on him. A milkboy who passed with his rattling\r\ncans observed Richard talking rapidly to no visible person, and turned\r\nround to stare.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to the house, he noticed that the blinds had been\r\ndrawn in the sitting-room. Lottie, the chubby-armed servant, was\r\ncleaning the step; her eyes were red with crying.\r\n\r\n"Is nurse up yet?" he asked her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, she\'s in the kitchen," the girl whimpered.\r\n\r\nHe sprang over the wet step into the passage. As his glance fell on\r\nthe stairs leading up to the room where lay the body of Mr. Aked,\r\nseparated from the unconscious Adeline only by a gimcrack wall of lath\r\nand plaster, an uncomfortable feeling of awe took hold of him. Death\r\nwas very incurable, and he had been assisting at a tragedy. How unreal\r\nand distorted seemed the events of a few hours before! He had a curious\r\nsense of partnership in shame, as if he and the nurse and the doctor\r\nhad last night done Adeline an injury and were conspiring to hide their\r\nsin. What would she say when she knew that her uncle was dead? What\r\nwould be her plans? It occurred to him now that she would of course act\r\nquite independently of himself; it was ridiculous to suppose that he,\r\ncomparatively a stranger, could stand to her in the place of kith and\r\nkin; he had been dreaming. He was miserably disheartened.\r\n\r\nHe made his way to the kitchen, and, pushing the door open quietly,\r\nfound the nurse engaged in cooking a meal.\r\n\r\n"May I come in, nurse?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Larch."\r\n\r\n"You seem to have taken charge of the house," he said, admiring her\r\nquick, neat movements; she was as much at home as if the kitchen had\r\nbeen her own.\r\n\r\n"We often find it necessary," she smiled. "Nurses have to be ready for\r\nmost things. Do you prefer tea or coffee for breakfast?"\r\n\r\n"Surely you aren\'t getting breakfast for me? I could have had something\r\nin town."\r\n\r\n"Surely I am," she said. "If you aren\'t fastidious, I\'ll make tea.\r\nMiss Aked has had a moderately good night ... I\'ve told her.... She\r\ntook it very well, said she expected it. Of course there\'s a lot to be\r\ndone, but I can\'t bother her yet. We ought to have a telegram from Mrs.\r\nHopkins, her aunt, this morning."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would give Miss Aked a message from me," Richard broke in.\r\n"Tell her I shall be very glad to see after things--the funeral, you\r\nknow, and so on--if she cares. I can easily arrange to take a holiday\r\nfrom the office."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that would relieve her from a lot of anxiety," the nurse\r\nsaid appreciatively. To hide a certain confusion Richard suggested that\r\nhe should be allowed to lay the cloth in the sitting-room, and she\r\ntold him he would find it in a drawer in the sideboard. He wandered\r\noff, speculating upon Adeline\'s probable answer to his proposal. Soon\r\nhe heard the rattling of cups and saucers, and the nurse\'s footstep on\r\nthe stair. He laid the cloth, putting the cruet in the middle and the\r\nsalt-cellars at opposite corners, and then sat down in front of the\r\ncase of French books to scan their titles, but he saw nothing save a\r\nblur of yellow. After a long time the nurse came down again.\r\n\r\n"Miss Aked says she cannot thank you enough. She will leave everything\r\nto you,--everything. She is very much obliged indeed. She doesn\'t think\r\nMrs. Hopkins will be able to travel, because of her rheumatism, and\r\nthere is no one else. Here is the key of Mr. Aked\'s desk, and some\r\nother keys--there should be about \xa320 in gold in the cash box, and\r\nperhaps some notes."\r\n\r\nHe took the keys, feeling profoundly happy.\r\n\r\n"I shall just go up to the office first," he decided, "and arrange to\r\nget off, and then come down here again. I suppose you will stay on till\r\nMiss Aked is better?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course."\r\n\r\n"She will be in bed several days yet?"\r\n\r\n"Probably. She might be able to sit up an hour or two the day after\r\nto-morrow--in her own room."\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t do for me to see her?"\r\n\r\n"I think not. She is very weak. No, you must act on your own\r\nresponsibility."\r\n\r\nHe and the nurse had breakfast together, talking with the freedom of\r\nold friends. He told her all he knew of the Akeds, not forgetting\r\nto mention that Mr. Aked and himself were to have collaborated in a\r\nbook. When Richard let this out, she showed none of those signs of\r\ntimid reverence which the laity are wont to exhibit in the presence of\r\nliterary people.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" she said politely, and then after a little pause: "I actually\r\nwrite verses myself sometimes."\r\n\r\n"You do? And are they published?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, but perhaps not on their merits. You see, my father has\r\ninfluence--"\r\n\r\n"A journalist, is he, perhaps?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed at the idea, and mentioned the name of a well-known\r\nnovelist.\r\n\r\n"And you prefer nursing to writing!" Richard ejaculated when he had\r\nrecovered from the announcement.\r\n\r\n"To anything in the world. That is why I am a nurse. Why should I\r\ndepend on my father, or my father\'s reputation?"\r\n\r\n"I admire you for not doing so," Richard replied. Hitherto he had only\r\nread about such women, and had questioned if they really existed.\r\nHe grew humble before her, recognising a stronger spirit. Yet her\r\nself-reliance somehow chafed him, and he directed his thoughts to\r\nAdeline\'s feminine trustfulness with a slight sense of relief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place on Sunday. Richard found the formalities to be\r\nfewer and simpler than he had expected, and no difficulties arose of\r\nany kind. Mrs. Hopkins, as Adeline had foreseen, was unable to come,\r\nbut she sent a long letter full of advice, and offering her niece a\r\ntemporary home. Adeline had not yet been allowed to leave her bed, but\r\non the Sunday morning the nurse had said that she might sit up for an\r\nhour or two in the afternoon, and would like to see Richard then.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Carteret Street on foot when the funeral was over.\r\n\r\n"You are glad it is all finished?" the nurse said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he answered a little wearily. His mind had dwelt on Mr. Aked\r\nthat day, and the lonely futility of the man\'s life had touched him\r\nwith chill, depressing effect. Moreover, now it came to the point, he\r\nrather dreaded than desired that first interview with Adeline after her\r\nuncle\'s death. He feared that despite any service he had rendered, they\r\nwere not much more than acquaintances. He morbidly conjectured what she\r\nwould say to him and how he would reply. But he was glad when the nurse\r\nleft him alone at the door of Adeline\'s room. He knocked rather louder\r\nthan he had intended, and after hesitating a second walked in. Adeline\r\nwas seated in an armchair near the window, fully dressed in black, with\r\na shawl over her shoulders. Her back was towards him, but he could see\r\nthat she was writing a letter on her knee. She looked round suddenly\r\nas the door opened, and gave a little "Oh!" at the same time lifting\r\nher hands. Her face was pale, her hair flat, and her eyes large and\r\nglittering. He went up to her.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Larch!" She held his hand in her thin white one with a soft, weak\r\npressure, silently gazing at him while tears gathered in her upturned\r\neyes. Richard trembled in every part of his body; he could not speak,\r\nand wondered what was the matter with him.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Larch, you have been very kind. I shall never be able to thank\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t bother about any thanks," he said. "Are you better?"\r\nAnd yet he wished her to say more.\r\n\r\nWith apparent reluctance she loosed his hand, and he sat down near her.\r\n\r\n"What should I have done without you!... Tell me about to-day. You\r\ncan\'t think how relieved I am now that it is over--the funeral, I mean."\r\n\r\nHe said there was nothing to tell.\r\n\r\n"Were there many other funerals?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a lot."\r\n\r\nHe answered her questions one after another; she seemed to be\r\ninterested in the least detail, but neither of them mentioned the dead\r\nman. Her eyes seldom left him. When he suggested that she must dismiss\r\nhim as soon as she felt tired, she laughed, and replied that she was\r\nnot likely to be tired for a very long while, and that he must have tea\r\nwith her and nurse.\r\n\r\n"I was writing to my two uncles in San Francisco when you came in," she\r\nsaid. "They will be terribly upset about me at first, poor fellows, but\r\nI have told them how kind you have been, and Uncle Mark always used\r\nto say I had plenty of sense, so that ought to ease their minds." She\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n"Of course you have made no definite plans yet?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, I sha\'n\'t settle anything at present. I want to consult you about\r\nseveral things, but some other time, when I am better. I shall have\r\nenough money, I think--that is one solid comfort. My aunt Grace--Mrs.\r\nHopkins--has asked me to go and stay with her. Somehow I don\'t want to\r\ngo--you\'ll think it queer of me, I daresay, but I would really prefer\r\nto stop in London."\r\n\r\nHe noticed that she said nothing as to joining her uncles in San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\n"I fancy I shall like London," she went on, "when I know it."\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t thinking, then, of going to San Francisco?"\r\n\r\nHe waited apprehensively for her answer. She hesitated. "It is so\r\nfar--I don\'t quite know how my uncles are situated--"\r\n\r\nEvidently, for some reason, she had no desire to leave London\r\nimmediately. He was very content, having feared that she might pass at\r\nonce away from him.\r\n\r\nThey had tea on a little round chess-table. The cramped space and\r\nthe consequent necessity of putting spare plates of cake on the bed\r\ncaused some amusement, but in the presence of the strong, brusque nurse\r\nAdeline seemed to withdraw within herself, and the conversation, such\r\nas it was, depended on the other two.\r\n\r\n"I have been telling Miss Aked," the nurse said after tea was over,\r\n"that she must go to the seaside for a week or two. It will do her an\r\nimmense deal of good. What she needs most of all is change. I suggested\r\nLittlehampton; it is rather a quiet spot, not too quiet; there is nice\r\nriver scenery, and a quaint old port, and quantities of lovely rustic\r\nvillages in the neighbourhood."\r\n\r\n"It would certainly be a good thing," Richard agreed; but Adeline said,\r\nrather petulantly, that she did not wish to travel, and the project was\r\nnot discussed further.\r\n\r\nHe left soon afterwards. The walk home seemed surprisingly short,\r\nand when he got to Raphael Street he could remember nothing of the\r\nthoroughfares through which he had passed. Vague, delicious fancies\r\nflitted through his head, like fine lines half recalled from a great\r\npoem. In his room there was a smell from the lamp, and the windows\r\nwere shut tight.\r\n\r\n"Poor old landlady," he murmured benignantly, "when will she learn to\r\nleave the windows open and not to turn down the lamp?"\r\n\r\nHaving unfastened one of the windows, he extinguished the lamp and went\r\nout on to the little balcony. It was a warm evening, with a cloudy\r\nsky and a gentle, tepid breeze. The noise of omnibuses and cabs came\r\neven and regular from Brompton Road, and occasionally a hansom passed\r\nup Raphael Street. He stood leaning on the front of the balcony till\r\nthe air of traffic had declined to an infrequent rumble, his thoughts\r\na smiling, whirling medley impossible to analyze or describe. At last\r\nhe came in, and, leaving the window ajar, undressed slowly without a\r\nlight, and lay down. He had no desire to sleep, nor did he attempt\r\nto do so; not for a ransom would he have parted with the fine, full\r\nconsciousness of life which thrilled through every portion of his\r\nbeing. The brief summer night came to an end; and just as the sun was\r\nrising he dozed a little, and then got up without a trace of fatigue.\r\nHe went to the balcony again, and drank in all the sweet invigorating\r\nfreshness of the morning. The sunlit streets were enveloped in an\r\nenchanted silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly three weeks later came the following letter from Adeline. In the\r\nmeanwhile she had had a rather serious relapse, and he had seen her\r\nonly once or twice for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n My dear Mr. Larch,--This time I am _quite_ sure I am well again. Nurse\r\n is obliged to leave to-day, as she is wanted at a hospital, and she\r\n has persuaded me to go to Littlehampton _at once_, and given me the\r\n address of some rooms. I shall leave Victoria to-morrow (Wednesday) by\r\n the 1.10 train; Lottie will go with me, and the house will be locked\r\n up. Good-bye for the present, if I don\'t see you. We shall not stay\r\n more than a week or ten days. I will write to you from Littlehampton.\r\n\r\n Ever yours most gratefully,\r\n\r\n A. A.\r\n\r\n P. S. I was expecting you down to-night.\r\n\r\n"\'If I don\'t see you\'!" he repeated to himself, smiling, and examining\r\nAdeline\'s caligraphy, which he had not seen before. It was a bold but\r\nnot distinguished hand. He read the note several times, then folded it\r\ncarefully and put it in his pocket-book.\r\n\r\nBy reason of an unexpected delay at the office he almost missed her\r\nat Victoria. The train was due out at least a minute before he rushed\r\ninto the station; fortunately trains are not invariably prompt. Adeline\r\nwas leaning from a carriage window to hand a penny to a newspaper boy;\r\nthe boy dropped the penny, and she laughed. She wore a black hat with\r\na veil. Her cheeks were a little fuller, and her eyes less unnaturally\r\nbrilliant, at any rate under the veil; and Richard thought that he had\r\nnever seen her look so pretty.\r\n\r\n"There it is, silly boy, there!" she was saying as he came up.\r\n\r\n"I thought I\'d just see if you were all right," he panted. "I should\r\nhave been here earlier, only I was detained."\r\n\r\n"How kind of you to take so much trouble!" she said, taking his hand,\r\nand fixing her eyes intently on his. The guard came along to fasten the\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\n"Luggage all in?" Richard asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, thanks. Lottie saw to it while I got the tickets. I find she is\r\nquite an experienced traveller." At which Lottie, effaced in a corner,\r\nblushed.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope you will enjoy yourself." The whistle sounded, and the\r\ntrain jerked forward Adeline began to wave a good-bye.\r\n\r\n"I see there\'s a Sunday league trip to Littlehampton on Sunday," he\r\nsaid, walking along with the train.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Do come down."\r\n\r\n"You\'d like me to?"\r\n\r\n"Very much."\r\n\r\n"I will, then. Send me the address."\r\n\r\nShe gave a succession of little nods, as the train carried her away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard\'s eye travelled expectantly over the tanned crowd of men\r\nin flannels and gaily attired girls which lined the platform of\r\nLittlehampton station, but Adeline was not to be seen. He felt somewhat\r\ndisappointed, and then decided that he liked her the better for not\r\nhaving come to meet him. "Besides," he thought, "the train being a\r\nspecial is not in the time-table, and she would not know when it was\r\ndue."\r\n\r\nHer lodging was in a long, monotonous terrace which ran at right angles\r\nto the seashore, turning its back upon the river. Noon was at hand, and\r\nthe fierce rays of the unclouded sun were untempered by any breeze. The\r\nstreet lay hushed, for everyone was either at church or on the sands.\r\nIn response to his inquiry, the landlady said that Miss Aked was out,\r\nand had left a message that if a gentleman called, he was to follow her\r\nto the jetty. Obeying the directions given to him, Richard soon found\r\nhimself by the banks of the swift Arun, with the jetty some distance in\r\nfront, and beyond that the sea, which shimmered blindly in the heat.\r\nThrongs of respectably dressed people wandered up and down, and a low,\r\nlanguid murmur of conversation floated out as it were from the cavities\r\nof a thousand parasols. Perspiring children whose hands were chafed\r\nby gloves full of creases ran to and fro among the groups, shouting\r\nnoisily, and heedless of the frequent injunction to remember what day\r\nit was. Here and there nurses pushing perambulators made cool spots\r\nof whiteness in the confusion of colour. On the river boats and small\r\nyachts were continually sweeping towards the sea on the ebbing tide;\r\nnow and then a crew of boys would attempt to pull a skiff against the\r\nrapid current, persevere for a few strokes, and then, amid scoffs from\r\nthe bank, ignominiously allow themselves to be whirled past the jetty\r\nwith the other craft.\r\n\r\nRichard had never seen a southern watering-place before, and he had\r\nfondly expected something different from Llandudno, Rhyl, or Blackpool,\r\nsomething less stolid and more continental. Littlehampton fell short\r\nof his anticipations. It was unpicturesque as a manufacturing town,\r\nand its summer visitors were an infestive, lower-middle class folk,\r\ngarishly clothed, and unlearned in the fine art of enjoyment. The pure\r\naccent of London sounded on every side from the lips of clerks and\r\nshop-girls and their kin. Richard forgot that he was himself a clerk,\r\nlooking not out of place in that scene.\r\n\r\nPresently he espied a woman who seemed to belong to another sphere. She\r\nwas leaning over the parapet of the jetty, and though a black and white\r\nsunshade entirely hid her head and shoulders, the simple, perfectly\r\nhung black skirt, the neatly shod foot, the small, smoothly gloved hand\r\nwith thin gold circlet at wrist, sufficed to convince him that here,\r\nby some strange chance, was one of those exquisite creatures who on\r\nSaturday afternoons drove past the end of Raphael Street on their way\r\nto Hurlingham or Barnes. He wondered what she did there, and tried to\r\ndetermine the subtleties of demeanour and costume which constituted\r\nthe plain difference between herself and the other girls on the jetty.\r\nAt that moment she stood erect, and turned round. Why, she was quite\r\nyoung.... He approached her.... It was Adeline.\r\n\r\nAstonishment was so clearly written on his face that she laughed as\r\nthey exchanged greetings.\r\n\r\n"You seem startled at the change in me," she said abruptly. "Do you\r\nknow that I positively adore clothes, though I\'ve only just found it\r\nout. The first thing I did when I got here was to go over to Brighton,\r\nand spend terrific sums at a dressmaker\'s. You see, there wasn\'t\r\ntime in London. You don\'t despise me for it, I hope? I\'ve plenty of\r\nmoney--enough to last a long, long time."\r\n\r\nShe was dazzling, and she openly rejoiced in the effect her appearance\r\nhad made on Richard.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t have done better," he answered, suddenly discovering with\r\nchagrin that his own serge suit was worn and shabby.\r\n\r\n"I\'m relieved," she said; "I was afraid my friend might think me vain\r\nand extravagant." Her manner of saying "my friend"--half mockery, half\r\ndeference--gave Richard intense satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThey walked to the end of the jetty and sat down on a stone seat.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it beautiful?" she exclaimed enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n"What--the town, or the people, or the sea?"\r\n\r\n"Everything. I\'ve scarcely been to the seaside before in all my life,\r\nand I think it\'s lovely."\r\n\r\n"The sea would be splendid if one could see it, but it blinds one even\r\nto glance at it in this heat."\r\n\r\n"You shall have half my sunshade." She put it over him with a\r\nprotective gesture.\r\n\r\n"No, no," he demurred.\r\n\r\n"I say yes. Why don\'t men carry sunshades? It\'s only their pride that\r\nstops them.... So you don\'t like the town and the people?"\r\n\r\n"Well--"\r\n\r\n"I love to see plenty of people about. And you would, too, if you\'d\r\nbeen fixed like me. I\'ve never seen a real crowd. There are crushes\r\nwhen you go into theatres, sometimes, aren\'t there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Women faint."\r\n\r\n"But I shouldn\'t. I would have given anything not long ago to be in one\r\nof those crushes. Now, of course, I can just please myself. When we are\r\nback in London, do you think I could persuade you to take me?"\r\n\r\n"You might," he said, "if you asked nicely. But young ladies who wear\r\nclothes like yours don\'t usually patronise the pit, where the crushes\r\nare. Stalls or dress circle would be more in your style. I propose we\r\ntake the dress circle. You wouldn\'t enjoy your crush going in, but at\r\nthe Lyceum and some other theatres, there is quite a superior crush\r\ncoming out of the stalls and dress circle."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is better. And I shall buy more clothes. Oh! I will be\r\nshockingly wasteful. If poor old uncle knew how his money was to be\r\nspent--"\r\n\r\nA little child, chased by one still less, fell down flat in front of\r\nthem, and began to cry. Adeline picked it up, losing her sunshade, and\r\nkissed both children. Then she took a paper of chocolates from her\r\npocket and gave several to each child, and they ran away without saying\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\n"Have one?" She offered the bag to Richard. "That\'s another luxury I\r\nshall indulge in--chocolates. Do have just one, to keep me company,"\r\nshe appealed. "By the way, about dinner. I ordered dinner for both of\r\nus at my rooms, but we can improve on that. I have discovered a lovely\r\nlittle village a few miles away, Angmering, all old cottages and no\r\ndrains. Let us drive there in a victoria, and picnic at a cottage. I\r\nknow the exact place for us. There will be no people there to annoy\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"But you like \'people,\' so that won\'t do at all."\r\n\r\n"I will do without \'people\' for this day."\r\n\r\n"And what shall we have for dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Eggs and bread and butter and tea."\r\n\r\n"Tea for dinner! Not very solid, is it?"\r\n\r\n"Greedy! If you have such a large appetite, eat a few more chocolates;\r\nthey will take it away."\r\n\r\nShe rose, pointing to a victoria in the distance.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her without getting up, and their eyes met with smiles.\r\nThen he, too, rose. He thought he had never felt so happy. An\r\nintoxicating vision of future felicities momentarily suggested itself,\r\nonly to fade before the actuality of the present.\r\n\r\nThe victoria stopped at Adeline\'s rooms. She called through the open\r\nwindow to Lottie, who came out and received orders to dine alone, or\r\nwith the landlady if she preferred.\r\n\r\n"Lottie and Mrs. Bishop are great friends," Adeline said. "The silly\r\ngirl would sooner stay in to help Mrs. Bishop with housework than go\r\nout on the beach with me."\r\n\r\n"She must indeed be silly. I know which I should choose!" It seemed a\r\nremark of unutterable clumsiness--after he had said it, but Adeline\'s\r\nfaint smile showed no dissatisfaction. He reflected that he would have\r\nbeen better pleased had she totally ignored it.\r\n\r\nThe carriage ran smoothly along the dusty roads, now passing under\r\ntrees, and now skirting poppy-clad fields whose vivid scarlet almost\r\nencroached on the highway itself. Richard lay back, as he had seen men\r\ndo in the Park, his shoulder lightly touching Adeline\'s. She talked\r\nincessantly, though slowly, in that low voice of hers, and her tones\r\nmingled with the measured trot of the enfeebled horse, and lulled\r\nRichard to a sensuous quiescence. He slightly turned his face towards\r\nhers, and with dreamy deliberateness examined her features,--the dimple\r\nin her cheek which he had never noticed before, the curves of her ear,\r\nher teeth, her smooth black hair, the play of light in her eye; then\r\nhis gaze moved to her large felt hat, set bewitchingly aslant on the\r\nsmall head, and then for a space he would look at the yellowish-green\r\nback of the imperturbable driver, who drove on and on, little witting\r\nthat enchantment was behind him.\r\n\r\nThey consumed the eggs and bread and butter and tea which Adeline had\r\npromised; and they filled their pockets with fruit. That was Adeline\'s\r\nidea. She gave herself up to enjoyment like a child. When the sun was\r\nless strenuous they walked about the village, sitting down frequently\r\nto admire its continual picturesqueness. Time sped with astonishing\r\nrapidity; Richard\'s train went at twenty-five minutes past seven, and\r\nalready, as they stood by the margin of the tiny tributary of the Arun,\r\nsome grandfather\'s clock in a neighbouring cottage clattered five. He\r\nwas tempted to say nothing about the train, quietly allow himself to\r\nmiss it, and go up by the first ordinary on Monday morning. But soon\r\nAdeline inquired about his return, and they set off to walk back to\r\nLittlehampton; the carriage had been dismissed. He invented pretexts\r\nfor loitering, made her sit on walls to eat apples, tried to get lost\r\nin by-paths, protested that he could not keep the pace she set; but\r\nto no purpose. They arrived at the station at exactly a quarter past\r\nseven. The platform was busy, and they strolled to the far end of it\r\nand stood by the engine.\r\n\r\n"I wish to heaven the train didn\'t leave so early," he said. "I\'m sure\r\nthe sea air would do me a lot of good, if I could get enough of it.\r\nWhat a beautiful day it has been!" He sighed sentimentally.\r\n\r\n"I never, never enjoyed myself so perfectly," she said emphatically.\r\n"Suppose we beseech the engine-driver to lie still for a couple of\r\nhours?" Richard\'s smile was inattentive.\r\n\r\n"You are sure you haven\'t done too much," he said with sudden\r\nsolicitude, looking at her half anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I! not a bit. I am absolutely well again." Her eyes found his and held\r\nthem, and it seemed to him that mystic messages passed to and fro.\r\n\r\n"How long do you think of staying?"\r\n\r\n"Not long. It gets rather boring, being alone. I expect I shall return\r\non Saturday."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking I would run down again on Saturday for the\r\nweek-end,--take a week-end ticket," he said; "but of course, if--"\r\n\r\n"In that case I should stay a few days longer. I couldn\'t allow myself\r\nto deprive you of the sea air which is doing you so much good. By next\r\nSaturday I may have discovered more nice places to visit, perhaps even\r\nprettier than Angmering.... But you must get in."\r\n\r\nHe would have given a great deal just then to be able to say firmly: "I\r\nhave changed my mind about going. I will stay at a hotel to-night and\r\ntake the first train to-morrow." But it required more decision than he\r\npossessed, and in a few moments he was waving good-bye to her from the\r\ncarriage window.\r\n\r\nThere were several other people in the compartment,--a shy\r\nshop-girl and her middle-aged lover, evidently employ\xe9s of the same\r\nestablishment, and an artisan with his wife and a young child. Richard\r\nobserved them intently, and found a curious, new pleasure in all their\r\nunstudied gestures and in everything they said. But chiefly he kept\r\na watch on the shop-girl\'s lover, who made it no secret that he was\r\ndwelling in the seventh heaven. Richard sympathised with that man. His\r\nglance fell on him softly, benignantly. As the train passed station\r\nafter station, he wondered what Adeline was doing, now, and now, and\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday he took tea with Adeline at her lodgings.\r\nThe train had been late, and by the time they were ready for the\r\nevening walk without which no visitor to the seaside calls the day\r\ncomplete, it was close upon nine o\'clock. The beach was like a fair or\r\na north-country wake. Conjurers, fire-eaters, and minstrels each drew\r\nan audience; but the principal attraction was a man and woman who wore\r\nmasks and were commonly supposed to be distinguished persons to whom\r\nfate had been unkind. They had a piano in a donkey-cart, and the woman\r\nsang to the man\'s accompaniment. Just as Richard and Adeline came up,\r\n"The River of Years" was announced for performance.\r\n\r\n"Let us listen to this," said Adeline.\r\n\r\nThey stood at the rim of the crowd. The woman had a rich contralto\r\nvoice and sang with feeling, and her listeners were generous of both\r\napplause and coppers.\r\n\r\n"I wonder who she is," Adeline murmured, with a touch of\r\nmelancholy,--"I wonder who she is. I love that song."\r\n\r\n"Oh, probably some broken-down concert-singer," Richard said curtly,\r\n"with a drunken husband."\r\n\r\n"But she sang beautifully. She made me feel--you know--funny.... A\r\nlovely feeling, isn\'t it?" She looked up at him.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, smiling at her.\r\n\r\n"You\'re laughing."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I\'m not. I know what you mean perfectly well. Perhaps I had it\r\njust then, too--- a little. But the song is a bit cheap."\r\n\r\n"_I_ could listen to it every day, and never get tired of listening.\r\nDon\'t you think that if a song gives _anyone_ that--feeling, there must\r\nbe some good in it?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s far better than most; but--"\r\n\r\n"But not equal to those classical songs you told me about--the first\r\ntime I saw you, wasn\'t it? Yes, Schubert: was that the name? I mean\r\nto get those, and you must show me the best ones, and play the\r\naccompaniments, and then I shall judge for myself."\r\n\r\n"I shall make an awful mess of the accompaniments; they\'re not\r\nprecisely easy, you know."\r\n\r\n"Full of accidentals, are they? I sha\'n\'t like them, then. I never do\r\nlike that sort of song."\r\n\r\n"But you will; you must."\r\n\r\n"Must I?" she almost whispered, in tones of gentle, feminine surrender.\r\nAnd after a second or two: "Then I\'ll try, if it will keep you in a\r\ngood temper."\r\n\r\nThey stood fronting the sea. She looked straight ahead into the\r\ndarkening distance, and then turned round to him with a mock plaintive\r\nexpression, and they both laughed.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t it be better up by the river," he suggested, "where there are\r\nfewer people?"\r\n\r\nA little to his surprise, she agreed that it was certainly rather noisy\r\nand crowded on the beach on Saturday nights, and they turned their\r\nbacks to the shore. The moon had risen, and shone at intervals through\r\nclouds. For a few score yards they walked in silence. Then Adeline\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n"It\'s very dull here during the week for a poor single woman like me. I\r\nshall go home on Monday."\r\n\r\n"But think of London in this weather."\r\n\r\n"I do think of it. I think of the parks and the restaurants and the\r\ntheatres."\r\n\r\n"The good theatres are closed now."\r\n\r\n"Well, the music-halls. I\'ve never been in one, and if they are very\r\nnaughty, then I want to go very much. Besides, there are lots of\r\ntheatres open. I\'ve read all the theatrical advertisements in the\r\n\'Telegraph,\' and there must be plenty of things to see. You mayn\'t\r\nthink them worth seeing, but I should enjoy any theatre."\r\n\r\n"I believe you would," he said. "I used to be like that."\r\n\r\n"Up to now I\'ve had no real pleasure--what I call pleasure--and I\'m\r\njust going to have it. I\'ll settle down afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t your uncle take you out much?"\r\n\r\n"I should say he didn\'t. He took me to a concert once. That was all--in\r\nnearly two years. I suppose it never occurred to him that I was leading\r\na dull life."\r\n\r\nShe made a movement with her hands, as if to put away from her all the\r\ndrab dailiness of her existence in Carteret Street.\r\n\r\n"You can soon recover lost time," Richard said cheerfully.\r\n\r\nHis fancy was in the rosy future, vividly picturing the light-hearted\r\ngaieties, Bohemian, unconventional, artistic, in which he and she\r\nshould unite. He saw himself and Adeline becoming dearer to each\r\nother, and still dearer, her spirit unfolding like a flower, and\r\ndisclosing new beauties day by day. He saw her eyes glisten when they\r\nmet his; felt the soft pressure of her hand; heard her voice waver\r\nwith tenderness, expectant of his avowal. And then came his own bold\r\ndeclaration: "I love you, Adeline," and her warm, willing lips were\r\nupon his. God! To dream of such beatitudes!\r\n\r\nShe had slightly quickened her step. The quays were silent and\r\ndeserted, save for these two. Presently masts rose vaguely against the\r\nsky, and they approached a large ship. Richard leaned over the parapet\r\nto decipher the name on her bows. "Juliane," he spelt out.\r\n\r\n"That is Norwegian or Danish."\r\n\r\nThey lingered a few moments, watching the movements of dim figures\r\non deck, listening to the musical chatter of an unknown tongue, and\r\nbreathing that atmosphere of romance and adventure which foreign\r\nvessels carry with them from strange lands; then they walked on.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" exclaimed Adeline, stopping, and touching Richard\'s arm.\r\n\r\nThe sailors were singing some quaint modern strain.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she asked when they had finished a verse.\r\n\r\n"It must be a Norwegian folk-song. It reminds me of Grieg."\r\n\r\nAnother verse was sung. It began to rain,--warm, summer drops.\r\n\r\n"You will be wet," Richard said.\r\n\r\n"Never mind."\r\n\r\nA third verse followed, and then a new air was started. It rained\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\n"Come under the shelter of the wall here," Richard urged, timidly\r\ntaking her arm. "I think I see an archway."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," she murmured, with sweet acquiescence; and they stood\r\ntogether a long time under the archway in silence, while the Norwegian\r\nsailors, heedless of weather, sang song after song.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the sky had cleared again, but there was a mist over\r\nthe calm sea. They walked idly on the level sands. At first they\r\nwere almost alone. The mist intensified distances; a group of little\r\nchildren paddling in a foot of water appeared to be miles away. Slowly\r\nthe mist was scattered by the sun, and the beach became populous with\r\nvisitors in Sunday attire. In the afternoon they drove to Angmering,\r\nAdeline having found no preferable haunt.\r\n\r\n"You have no train to catch to-night," she said; "what a relief! Shall\r\nyou start very early to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not particular," he answered. "Why?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking that Lottie and I would go up by the same train as you,\r\nbut perhaps you won\'t care to be bothered with women and their luggage."\r\n\r\n"If you really intend to return to-morrow, I\'ll wire to Curpet not to\r\nexpect me till after lunch, and we\'ll go at a reasonable hour."\r\n\r\nHe left her at her lodging as the clock was striking eleven; but\r\ninstead of making direct for his hotel, he turned aside to the river\r\nto have a last look at the "Juliane." Curiously, it began to rain,\r\nand he sheltered under the archway where he had stood with Adeline on\r\nthe previous night. Aboard the "Juliane" there was stir and bustle.\r\nHe guessed that the ship was about to weigh anchor and drop down with\r\nthe tide. Just after midnight she slid cautiously away from the quay,\r\nto the accompaniment of hoarse calls and the rattling of chains and\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the journey to town Adeline would talk of nothing but her\r\nintention to taste all the amusements which London had to offer. She\r\nasked numberless questions with the persistency of an inquisitive\r\nchild, while Lottie modestly hid herself behind a copy of "Tit Bits,"\r\nwhich had been bought for her.\r\n\r\n"Now I will read out the names of the plays advertised in the\r\n\'Telegraph,\'" she said, "and you must tell me what each is like, and\r\nwhether the actors are good, and the actresses pretty, and things of\r\nthat kind."\r\n\r\nRichard entered with zest into the conversation. He was in a boisterous\r\nmood, and found her very willing to be diverted. Once, when he used\r\na technical term, she stopped him: "Remember, I have never been to a\r\ntheatre." On Sunday she had made the same remark several times. It\r\nseemed as if she liked to insist on the point.\r\n\r\nThe morning was delicious, full of light and freshness, and the torpid\r\ncountryside through which the train swept at full speed suggested a\r\ngentle yet piquant contrast to the urban, gaslight themes which they\r\nwere discussing. Though the sun shone with power, Adeline would not\r\nhave the blinds drawn, but sometimes she used the newspaper for a\r\nshade, or bent her head so that the broad brim of her hat might come\r\nbetween her eyes and the sunshine. After an hour the talk slackened\r\nsomewhat. As Richard, from his seat opposite, looked now at Adeline and\r\nnow at the landscape, a perfect content stole over him. He wished that\r\nthe distance to London could have been multiplied tenfold, and rejoiced\r\nin every delay. Then he began to miss the purport of her questions, and\r\nshe had to repeat them. He was examining his heart. "Is this love?" his\r\nthoughts ran. "Do I actually love her now,--_now_?"\r\n\r\nWhen the train stopped at New Cross, and Richard said that they would\r\nbe at London Bridge in a few minutes, she asked when he would go down\r\nto Carteret Street.\r\n\r\n"Any time," he said.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow night?"\r\n\r\nHe had hoped she would fix the same evening. "When is the theatre-going\r\nto commence?" he queried.\r\n\r\nShe laughed vaguely: "Soon."\r\n\r\n"Suppose I book seats for the Comedy?"\r\n\r\n"We will talk about it to-morrow night."\r\n\r\nIt appeared that her desire for the relaxations of town life had\r\nsuddenly lost its instancy.\r\n\r\nImmediately he reached the office he wrote a note to Mr. Clayton\r\nVernon. Some three hundred pounds was coming to him under the will of\r\nWilliam Vernon, and he had purposed to let Mr. Clayton Vernon invest\r\nthis sum for him; but the letter asked that a cheque for \xa325 should be\r\nsent by return of post. Later in the afternoon he went to a tailor in\r\nHolborn, and ordered two suits of clothes.\r\n\r\nHe grew restless and introspective, vainly endeavouring to analyse\r\nhis feeling towards Adeline. He wished that he had himself suggested\r\nthat he should call on her that night, instead of allowing her to\r\nname Tuesday. When he got home, he looked at the letter which he had\r\nreceived from her a fortnight before, and then, enclosing it in a\r\nclean envelope, put it away carefully in his writing-case. He felt\r\nthat he must preserve all her letters. The evening dragged itself out\r\nwith desolating tedium. Once he went downstairs intending to go to the\r\ntheatre, but returned before he had unlatched the front door.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rowbotham laid his supper that evening, and he began to tell her\r\nabout his holiday, mentioning, with fictitious _na\xefvet\xe9_, that he\r\nhad spent it in the company of a young lady. Soon he gave the whole\r\nhistory of his acquaintance with the Akeds. She warmly praised his\r\nkindness towards Adeline.\r\n\r\n"My Lily is keeping company with a young man," she said, after a pause;\r\n"a respectable young chap he is, a bus-conductor. This is his night\r\noff, and they\'re gone to the Promenade Concert. I didn\'t like her going\r\nat first, but, bless you, you have to give in. Young folk are young\r\nfolk, all the world over.... But I must be getting downstairs again. I\r\nhave to do everything myself to-night. Ah! when a girl falls in love,\r\nshe forgets her mother. It\'s natural, I suppose. Well, Mr. Larch, it\r\nwill be your turn soon, I hope." With that she left the room quickly,\r\nmissing Richard\'s hurried disclaimer.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re engaged, Lily," he said to the girl next morning.\r\n\r\nLily blushed and nodded; and as he looked at her eyes, he poignantly\r\nlonged for the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nThey sat by the window and talked till the day began to fade and the\r\nlamplighter had passed up the street. Several matters of business\r\nneeded discussion,--the proving of Mr. Aked\'s will, the tenancy of\r\nthe house and the opening of a new banking-account. Richard, who was\r\nacting informally as legal adviser, after the manner of solicitors\'\r\nclerks towards their friends, brought from his pocket some papers for\r\nAdeline\'s signature. She took a pen immediately.\r\n\r\n"Where do I put my name?"\r\n\r\n"But you must read them first."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t understand them a bit," she said; "and what is the use of\r\nemploying a lawyer, if one is put to the trouble of reading everything\r\none signs?"\r\n\r\n"Well--please yourself. To-morrow you will have to go before a\r\ncommissioner for oaths and swear that certain things are true; you\'ll\r\nbe compelled to read the affidavits."\r\n\r\n"That I won\'t! I shall just swear."\r\n\r\n"But you simply must."\r\n\r\n"Sha\'n\'t. If I swear to fibs, it will be your fault."\r\n\r\n"Suppose I read them out to you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that would be nicer; but not now, after supper."\r\n\r\nFor a few moments there was silence. She stood up and drew her finger\r\nin fanciful curves across the window-pane. Richard watched her, with a\r\nsmile of luxurious content. It appeared to him that all her movements,\r\nevery inflection of her voice, her least word, had the authenticity\r\nand the intrinsic grace of natural phenomena. If she turned her head\r\nor tapped her foot, the gesture was right,--having the propriety which\r\nsprings from absolute self-unconsciousness. Her mere existence from one\r\nmoment to the next seemed in some mysterious way to suggest a possible\r\nsolution of the riddle of life. She illustrated nature. She was for\r\nhim intimately a part of nature, the great Nature which hides itself\r\nfrom cities. To look at her afforded him a delight curiously similar to\r\nthat which the townsman derives from a rural landscape. Her face had\r\nlittle conventional beauty; her conversation contained no hint either\r\nof intellectual powers or of a capacity for deep feeling. But in her\r\ncase, according to his view, these things were unnecessary, would in\r\nfact have been superfluous. She _was_ and that sufficed.\r\n\r\nMingled with the pleasure which her nearness gave him, there were\r\nsubordinate but distinct sensations. Except his sister Mary, he had\r\nnever before been upon terms of close familiarity with any woman, and\r\nhe realised with elation that now for the first time the latencies\r\nof manhood were aroused. His friendship--if indeed it were nothing\r\nelse--with this gracious, inscrutable creature seemed a thing to be\r\nvery proud of, to gloat upon in secret, to contemplate with a dark\r\nsmile as one walked along the street or sat in a bus.... And then, with\r\na shock of joyful, half-incredulous surprise, he made the discovery\r\nthat she--she--had found some attractiveness in himself.\r\n\r\nTheir loneliness gave zest and piquancy to the situation. On neither\r\nside were there relatives or friends who might obtrude, or whom it\r\nwould be proper to consult. They had only themselves to consider.\r\nNot a soul in London, with the exception of Lottie, knew of their\r\nintimacy,--the visit to Littlehampton, their plans for visiting the\r\ntheatres, her touching reliance upon him. Ah, that confiding feminine\r\ntrust! He read it frequently in her glance, and it gave him a sense of\r\nprotective possession. He had approached no closer than to shake her\r\nhand, and yet, as he looked at the slight frame, the fragile fingers,\r\nthe tufts of hair which escaped over her ears,--these things seemed to\r\nbe his. Surely she had donned that beautiful dress for him; surely she\r\nmoved gracefully for him, talked softly for him!\r\n\r\nHe left his chair, quietly lighted the candles at the piano, and began\r\nto turn over some songs.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" she asked, from the window.\r\n\r\n"I want you to sing."\r\n\r\n"Must I?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Let me find something with an easy accompaniment."\r\n\r\nShe came towards him, took up a song, opened it, and bade him look at\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Too difficult," he said abruptly. "Those arpeggios in the bass,--I\r\ncouldn\'t possibly play them."\r\n\r\nShe laid it aside obediently.\r\n\r\n"Well, this?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Let us try that."\r\n\r\nShe moved nearer to him, to miss the reflection of the candles on the\r\npaper, and put her hands behind her back. She cleared her throat. He\r\nknew she was nervous, but he had no such feeling himself.\r\n\r\n"Ready?" he asked, glancing round and up into her face. She smiled\r\ntimidly, flushing, and then nodded.\r\n\r\n"No," she exclaimed the next second, as he boldly struck the first\r\nchord. "I don\'t think I\'ll sing. I can\'t."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you will--yes, you will."\r\n\r\n"Very well." She resigned herself.\r\n\r\nThe first few notes were tremulous, but quickly she gained courage. The\r\nsong was a mediocre drawing-room ballad, and she did not sing with much\r\nexpression, but to Richard\'s ear her weak contralto floated out above\r\nthe accompaniment with a rich, passionate quality full of intimate\r\nmeanings. When his own part of the performance was not too exacting, he\r\nwatched from the corner of his eye the rise and fall of her breast, and\r\nthought of Keats\'s sonnet; and then he suddenly quaked in fear that all\r\nthis happiness might crumble at the touch of some adverse fate.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you call that a poor song," she said when it was finished.\r\n\r\n"I liked it very much."\r\n\r\n"You did? I am so fond of it, and I\'m glad you like it. Shall we try\r\nanother?" She offered the suggestion with a gentle diffidence which\r\nmade Richard desire to abase himself before her, to ask what in the\r\nname of heaven she meant by looking to him as an authority, a person\r\nwhose will was to be consulted and whose humours were law.\r\n\r\nAgain she put her hands behind her back, cleared her throat, and began\r\nto sing.... He had glimpses of mystic, emotional deeps in her spirit\r\nhitherto unsuspected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLottie came in with a lamp.\r\n\r\n"You would like supper?" Adeline said. "Lottie, let us have supper at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\nRichard remembered that when Mr. Aked was alive, Adeline had been\r\naccustomed to go into the kitchen and attend to the meals herself;\r\nbut evidently this arrangement was now altered. She extinguished the\r\ncandles on the piano, and took the easy-chair with a question about\r\nSchubert. Supper was to be served without the aid of the mistress of\r\nthe house. She had been training Lottie,--that was clear. He looked\r\nround. The furniture was unchanged, but everything had an unwonted air\r\nof comfort and neatness, and Adeline\'s beautiful dress scarcely seemed\r\nout of keeping with the general aspect of the room. He gathered that\r\nshe had social aspirations. He had social aspirations himself. His\r\nfancy delighted to busy itself with fine clothes, fine furniture, fine\r\nfood, and fine manners. That his own manners had remained inelegant\r\nwas due to the fact that the tireless effort and vigilance which any\r\namelioration of their original crudity would have necessitated, were\r\nbeyond his tenacity of purpose.\r\n\r\nThe supper was trimly laid on a very white tablecloth, and chairs were\r\ndrawn up. Lottie stood in the background for a few moments; Adeline\r\ncalled her for some trifling service, and then dismissed her.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you have some whisky? I know men always like whisky at night."\r\n\r\nShe touched a bell on the table.\r\n\r\n"The whisky, Lottie--you forgot it."\r\n\r\nRichard was almost awed by her demeanour. Where could she have learnt\r\nit? He felt not unlike a bumpkin, and secretly determined to live up to\r\nthe standard of deportment which she had set.\r\n\r\n"You may smoke," she said, when Lottie had cleared the table after\r\nsupper; "I like it. Here are some cigarettes--\'Three Castles\'--will\r\nthey do?" Laughing, she produced a box from the sideboard, and handed\r\nit to him. He went to the sofa, and she stood with one elbow resting on\r\nthe mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n"About going to the theatre--" she began.\r\n\r\n"May I take you? Let us go to the Comedy."\r\n\r\n"And you will book seats, the dress circle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. What night?"\r\n\r\n"Let us say Friday.... And now you may read me those documents."\r\n\r\nWhen that business was transacted, Richard felt somehow that he must\r\ndepart, and began to take his leave. Adeline stood erect, facing him in\r\nfront of the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n"Next time you come, you will bring those Schubert songs, will you not?"\r\n\r\nThen she rang the bell, shook hands, and sat down. He went out; Lottie\r\nwas waiting in the passage with his hat and stick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven or eight weeks passed.\r\n\r\nDuring that time Richard spent many evenings with Adeline, at the\r\ntheatre, at concerts, and at Carteret Street. When they were going up\r\nto town, he called for her in a hansom. She usually kept him waiting\r\na few minutes. He sat in the sitting-room, listening to the rattle\r\nof harness and the occasional stamp of a hoof outside. At length he\r\nheard her light step on the stairs, and she entered the room, smiling\r\nproudly. She was wonderfully well dressed, with modish simplicity and\r\nexact finish, and she gave him her fan to hold while she buttoned\r\nher long gloves. Where she ordered her gowns he never had the least\r\nnotion. They followed one another in rapid succession, and each seemed\r\nmore beautiful than the last. All were sober in tint; the bodices were\r\nV-shaped, and cut rather low.\r\n\r\nLottie carefully placed a white wrap over her mistress\'s head, and then\r\nthey were off. In the hansom there was but little conversation, and\r\nthat of a trivial character. In vain he endeavoured to entice her into\r\ndiscussions. He mentioned books which he had read; she showed only a\r\nperfunctory interest. He explained why, in his opinion, a particular\r\nplay was good and another bad; generally she preferred the wrong\r\none, or at least maintained that she liked all plays, and therefore\r\nwould not draw comparisons. Sometimes she would argue briefly about\r\nthe conduct of certain characters in a piece, but he seldom found\r\nhimself genuinely in agreement with her, though as a rule he verbally\r\nconcurred. In music she was a little less unsympathetic towards his\r\nideals. They had tried over several of his favourite classical songs,\r\nand he had seen in her face, as she listened, or hummed the air, a glow\r\nanswering to his own enthusiasm. She had said that she would learn one\r\nof them, but the promise had not been kept, though he had reminded her\r\nof it several times.\r\n\r\nThese chagrins, however, were but infinitesimal ripples upon the\r\nsmooth surface of his happiness. All of them together were as nothing\r\ncompared to the sensations which he experienced in helping her out of\r\nthe cab, in the full glare of a theatre fa\xe7ade. Invariably he overpaid\r\nthe driver, handing him the silver with an inattentive gesture, while\r\nAdeline waited on the steps,--dainty food for the eyes of loiterers and\r\npassers-by. He offered his arm, and they passed down the vestibule and\r\ninto the auditorium. With what artless enjoyment she settled herself in\r\nher seat, breathing the atmosphere of luxury and display as if it had\r\nbeen ozone, smiling radiantly at Richard, and then eagerly examining\r\nthe occupants of the boxes through a small, silver-mounted glass! She\r\nwas never moved by the events on the stage, and whether it happened to\r\nbe tragedy or burlesque at which they were assisting, she turned to\r\nRichard at the end of every act with the same happy, contented smile,\r\nand usually began to make remarks upon the men and women around her. It\r\nwas the play-house and not the play of which she was really fond.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the curtain, they lingered till most of the audience\r\nhad gone. Sometimes they supped at a restaurant. "It is my turn,"\r\nshe would say now and then, when the obsequious waiter presented the\r\nbill, and would give Richard her purse. At first, for form\'s sake, he\r\ninsisted on his right to pay, but she would not listen. He wondered\r\nwhere she had caught the pretty trick of handing over her purse instead\r\nof putting down the coins, and he traced it to a play which they had\r\nseen at the Vaudeville theatre. Yet she did it with such naturalness\r\nthat it did not seem to have been copied. The purse was small, and\r\nalways contained several pounds in gold, with a little silver. The\r\nbill paid, he gave it back to her with a bow.\r\n\r\nThen came the long, rapid drive home, through interminable lamp-lined\r\nstreets, peopled now only by hansoms and private carriages, past\r\nall the insolent and garish splendours of Piccadilly clubs, into\r\nwhose unveiled windows Adeline eagerly gazed; past the mysterious,\r\nnight-ridden Park; past the dim, solemn squares and crescents of\r\nKensington and Chelsea, and so into the meaner vicinage of Fulham.\r\nIt was during these midnight journeys, more than at any other time,\r\nthat Richard felt himself to be a veritable inhabitant of the City of\r\nPleasure. Adeline, flushed with the evening\'s enjoyment, talked of\r\nmany things, in her low, even voice, which was never raised. Richard\r\nanswered briefly; an occasional reply was all she seemed to expect.\r\n\r\nImmediately, on getting out of the cab, she said good-night, and\r\nentered the house alone, while Richard directed the driver back to\r\nRaphael Street. Returning thus, solitary, he endeavoured to define what\r\nshe was to him, and he to her. Often, when actually in her presence, he\r\nventured to ask himself, "Am I happy? Is this pleasure?" But as soon as\r\nhe had left her, his doubtfulness vanished, and he began to long for\r\ntheir next meeting. Little phrases of hers, unimportant gestures, came\r\nback vividly to his memory; he thought how instinct with charm they\r\nwere. And yet, was he really, truly in love? Was she in love? Had there\r\nbeen a growth of feeling since that night at Carteret Street after the\r\nholiday at Littlehampton? He uncomfortably suspected that their hearts\r\nhad come nearer to each other that night than at any time since.\r\n\r\nHe tried to look forward to the moment when he should invite her to\r\nbe his wife. But was that moment approaching? At the back of his mind\r\nlay an apprehension that it was not. She satisfied one part of his\r\nnature. She was the very spirit of grace; she was full of aplomb and\r\na delicate tact; she had money. Moreover, her constant reliance upon\r\nhim, her clinging womanishness, the caressing, humouring tone which her\r\nvoice could assume, powerfully affected him. He divined darkly that\r\nhe was clay in her hands; that all the future, even the future of his\r\nown heart, depended entirely upon her. If she chose, she might be his\r\ngoddess.... And yet she had sharp limitations....\r\n\r\nAgain, was she in love?\r\n\r\nWhen he woke up of a morning he wondered how long his present happiness\r\nwould continue, and whither it was leading him. A scrap of conversation\r\nwhich he had had with Adeline recurred to him frequently. He had asked\r\nher, once when she had complained of ennui, why she did not become\r\nacquainted with some of her neighbours.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for my neighbours," she replied curtly.\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t live without acquaintances all your life."\r\n\r\n"No, not all my life," she said with significant emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had been to the National Gallery; it was Saturday afternoon.\r\nAdeline said that she would go home; but Richard, not without a little\r\ntrouble, persuaded her to dine in town first; he mentioned a French\r\nrestaurant in Soho.\r\n\r\nAs they walked up Charing Cross Road, he pointed out the Crabtree, and\r\nreferred to the fact that at one time he had frequented it regularly.\r\nShe stopped to look at its white-and-gold frontage. In enamel letters\r\non the windows were the words: "Table d\'h\xf4te, 6 to 9, 1/6."\r\n\r\n"Is it a good place?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"The best in London--of that kind."\r\n\r\n"Then let us dine there; I have often wanted to try a vegetarian\r\nrestaurant."\r\n\r\nRichard protested that she would not like it.\r\n\r\n"How do you know? If you have been so often, why shouldn\'t I go once?"\r\nShe smiled at him, and turned to cross the street; he hung back.\r\n\r\n"But I only went for economy."\r\n\r\n"Then we will only go for economy to-day."\r\n\r\nHe dangled before her the attractions of the French restaurant\r\nin Soho, but to no purpose. He was loth to visit the Crabtree.\r\nMost probably Miss Roberts would be on duty within, and he felt an\r\ninscrutable unwillingness to be seen by her with Adeline.... At last\r\nthey entered. Looking through the glass doors which lead to the\r\nlarge, low-ceiled dining-room on the first floor, Richard saw that\r\nit was nearly empty, and that the cash-desk, where Miss Roberts was\r\naccustomed to sit, was for the moment unoccupied. He led the way in\r\nrather hurriedly, and selected places in a far corner. Although it was\r\nscarcely beginning to be dusk, the table electric lights were turned\r\non, and their red shades made glimmering islands of radiance about the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nRichard kept a furtive watch on the cash-desk; presently he saw Miss\r\nRoberts take her seat behind it, and shifted his glance to another\r\nquarter. He was preoccupied, and answered at random Adeline\'s amused\r\nqueries as to the food. Between the soup and the entr\xe9e they were kept\r\nwaiting; and Adeline, Richard being taciturn, moved her chair in order\r\nto look round the room. Her roving eyes stopped at the cash-desk,\r\nleft it, and returned to it. Then a scornful smile, albeit scarcely\r\nperceptible, appeared on her face; but she said nothing. Richard saw\r\nher glance curiously at the cash-desk several times, and he knew, too,\r\nthat Miss Roberts had discovered them. In vain he assured himself that\r\nMiss Roberts was not concerned in his affairs; he could not dismiss a\r\nsensation of uneasiness and discomfort. Once he fancied that the eyes\r\nof the two girls met, and that both turned away suddenly.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner was over, and they were drinking the coffee for which\r\nthe Crabtree is famous, Adeline said abruptly,--\r\n\r\n"I know someone here."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Richard, with fictitious nonchalance. "Who?"\r\n\r\n"The girl at the pay-desk,--Roberts, her name is."\r\n\r\n"Where have you met her?" he inquired.\r\n\r\nAdeline laughed inimically. He was startled, almost shocked, by the\r\nharsh mien which transformed her face.\r\n\r\n"You remember one night, just before uncle died," she began, bending\r\ntowards him, and talking very quietly. "Someone called while you and\r\nI were in the sitting-room, to inquire how he was. That was Laura\r\nRoberts. She used to know uncle--she lives in our street. He made love\r\nto her--she didn\'t care for him, but he had money and she encouraged\r\nhim. I don\'t know how far it went--I believe I stopped it. Oh! men are\r\nthe strangest creatures. Fancy, she\'s not older than me, and uncle was\r\nover fifty!"\r\n\r\n"Older than you, surely!" Richard put in.\r\n\r\n"Well, not much. She knew I couldn\'t bear her, and she called that\r\nnight simply to annoy me."\r\n\r\n"What makes you think that?"\r\n\r\n"Think! I know it.... But you must have heard of the affair. Didn\'t\r\nthey talk about it at your office?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it was mentioned once," he said hastily.\r\n\r\nShe leaned back in her chair, with the same hard smile. Richard felt\r\nsure that Miss Roberts had guessed they were talking about herself,\r\nand that her eyes were fixed on them, but he dared not look up for\r\nconfirmation; Adeline gazed boldly around her. They were antagonistic,\r\nthese two women, and Richard, do what he would, could not repress\r\na certain sympathy with Miss Roberts. If she had encouraged Mr.\r\nAked\'s advances, what of that? It was no mortal sin, and he could not\r\nappreciate the reason of Adeline\'s strenuous contempt for her. He saw a\r\nlittle gulf widening between himself and Adeline.\r\n\r\n"What tremendously red hair that girl has!" she said, later on.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but doesn\'t it look fine!"\r\n\r\n"Ye-es," Adeline agreed condescendingly.\r\n\r\nWhen he paid the bill, on the way out, Miss Roberts greeted him with\r\nan inclination of the head. He met her eye steadily, and tried not to\r\nblush. As she checked the bill with a tapping pencil, he could not help\r\nremarking her face. Amiability, candour, honesty, were clearly written\r\non its attractive plainness. He did not believe that she had been\r\nguilty of running after Mr. Aked for the sake of his money. The tales\r\ntold by Jenkins were doubtless ingeniously exaggerated; and as for\r\nAdeline, Adeline was mistaken.\r\n\r\n"Good evening," Miss Roberts said simply, as they went out. He raised\r\nhis hat.\r\n\r\n"You know her, then!" Adeline exclaimed in the street.\r\n\r\n"Well," he answered, "I\'ve been going there, off and on, for a year\r\nor two, and one gets acquainted with the girls." His tone was rather\r\npetulant. With a quick, winning smile, she changed the subject, and he\r\nsuspected her of being artful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n"I am going to America," she said.\r\n\r\nThey sat in the sitting-room at Carteret street. Richard had not seen\r\nher since the dinner at the vegetarian restaurant, and these were\r\nalmost the first words she addressed to him. Her voice was as tranquil\r\nas usual; but he discerned, or thought he discerned, in her manner a\r\nconsciousness that she was guilty towards him, that at least she was\r\nnot treating him justly.\r\n\r\nThe blow was like that of a bullet: he did not immediately feel it.\r\n\r\n"Really?" he questioned foolishly, and then, though he knew that she\r\nwould never return: "For how long are you going, and how soon?"\r\n\r\n"Very soon, because I always do things in a hurry. I don\'t know for\r\nhow long. It\'s indefinite. I have had a letter from my uncles in San\r\nFrancisco, and they say I _must_ join them; they can\'t do without me.\r\nThey are making a lot of money now, and neither of them is married....\r\nSo I suppose I must obey like a good girl. You see I have no relatives\r\nhere, except Aunt Grace."\r\n\r\n"You many never come back to England?"\r\n\r\n(Did she colour, or was it Richard\'s fancy?)\r\n\r\n"Well, I expect I may visit Europe sometimes. It wouldn\'t do to give\r\nEngland up entirely. There are so many nice things in England,--in\r\nLondon especially...."\r\n\r\nOnce, in late boyhood, he had sat for an examination which he felt\r\nconfident of passing. When the announcement arrived that he failed, he\r\ncould not believe it, though all the time he knew it to be true. His\r\nthoughts ran monotonously: "There must be some mistake; there must be\r\nsome mistake!" and like a little child in the night, he resolutely shut\r\nhis eyes to keep out the darkness of the future. The same puerility\r\nmarked him now. Assuming that Adeline fulfilled her intention, his\r\nexistence in London promised to be tragically cheerless. But this\r\ngave him no immediate concern, because he refused to contemplate the\r\npossibility of their intimacy being severed. He had, indeed, ceased\r\nto think; somewhere at the back of the brain his thoughts lay in wait\r\nfor him. For the next two hours (until he left the house) he lived\r\nmechanically, as it were, and not by volition, subsisting merely on a\r\npreviously acquired momentum.\r\n\r\nHe sat in front of her and listened. She began to talk of her uncles\r\nMark and Luke. She described them in detail, told stories of her\r\nchildhood, even recounted the common incidents of her daily life with\r\nthem. She dwelt on their kindness of heart, and their affection for\r\nherself; and with it all she seemed a little to patronise them, as\r\nthough she had been accustomed to regard them as her slaves.\r\n\r\n"They are rather old-fashioned," she said, "unless they have altered.\r\nSince I heard from them, I have been wondering what they would think\r\nabout my going to theatres and so on--with you."\r\n\r\n"What should they think?" Richard broke in. "There\'s nothing whatever\r\nin that. London isn\'t a provincial town, or even an American city."\r\n\r\n"I shall tell them all about you," she went on, "and how kind you were\r\nto me when I scarcely knew you at all. You couldn\'t have been kinder if\r\nyou\'d been my only cousin."\r\n\r\n"Say \'brother,\'" he laughed awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"No, really, I\'m quite serious. I never thanked you properly. Perhaps I\r\nseemed to take it all as a matter of course."\r\n\r\nHe wished to heaven she would stop.\r\n\r\n"I\'m disgusted that you are going," he grumbled, putting his hands\r\nbehind his head,--"disgusted."\r\n\r\n"In many ways I am sorry too. But don\'t you think I am doing the right\r\nthing?"\r\n\r\n"How am I to tell?" he returned quickly. "All I know is that when you\r\ngo I shall be left all alone by my little self. You must think of me\r\nsometimes in my lonely garret." His tone was light and whimsical, but\r\nshe would not follow his lead.\r\n\r\n"I shall often think of you," she said musingly, scanning intently the\r\ntoe of her shoe.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that she desired to say something serious, to justify\r\nherself to him, but could not gather courage to frame the words.\r\n\r\nWhen he got out of the house, his thoughts sprang forth. It was a\r\nchilly night; he turned up the collar of his overcoat, plunged his\r\nhands deep into the pockets, and began to walk hurriedly, heedlessly,\r\nwhile examining his feelings with curious deliberation. In the first\r\nplace, he was inexpressibly annoyed. "Annoyed,"--that was the right\r\nword. He could not say that he loved her deeply, or that there was a\r\nprospect of his loving her deeply, but she had become a delightful\r\nfactor in his life, and he had grown used to counting upon her for\r\nsociety. Might he not, in time, conceivably have asked her to marry\r\nhim? Might she not conceivably have consented? In certain directions\r\nshe had disappointed him; beyond doubt her spiritual narrowness had\r\nchecked the growth of a passion which he had sedulously cherished and\r\nfostered in himself. Yet, in spite of that, her feminine grace, her\r\nfeminine trustfulness, still exercised a strong and delicate charm. She\r\nwas a woman and he was a man, and each was the only friend the other\r\nhad; and now she was going away. The mere fact that she found a future\r\nwith her uncles in America more attractive than the life she was then\r\nleading, cruelly wounded his self-love. He, then, was nothing to her,\r\nafter all; he had made no impression; she could relinquish him without\r\nregret! At that moment she seemed above and beyond him. He was the poor\r\nearthling; she the winged creature that soared in freedom now here, now\r\nthere, giving her favours lightly, and as lightly withdrawing them.\r\n\r\nOne thing came out clear: he was an unlucky fellow.\r\n\r\nHe ran over in his mind the people who would remain to him in London\r\nwhen she had gone. Jenkins, Miss Roberts--Bah! how sickeningly\r\ncommonplace were they! _She_ was distinguished. She had an air, a\r\n_je ne sais quoi_, which he had never observed in a woman before.\r\nHe recalled her gowns, her gestures, her turns of speech,--all the\r\ninstinctive touches by which she proved her superiority.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him fancifully that there was a connection between her\r\napparently sudden resolve to leave England, and their visit to the\r\nCrabtree and encounter with Miss Roberts. He tried to see in that\r\nincident a premonition of misfortune. What morbid fatuity!\r\n\r\nBefore he went to sleep that night he resolved that at their next\r\nmeeting he would lead the conversation to a frank discussion of their\r\nrelations and "have it out with her." But when he called at Carteret\r\nStreet two days later, he found it quite impossible to do any such\r\nthing. She was light-hearted and gay, and evidently looked forward to\r\nthe change of life with pleasure. She named the day of departure, and\r\nmentioned that she had arranged to take Lottie with her. She consulted\r\nhim about a compromise, already effected, with her landlord as to the\r\nremainder of the tenancy, and said she had sold the furniture as it\r\nstood, for a very small sum, to a dealer. It hurt him to think that she\r\nhad given him no opportunity of actively assisting her in the hundred\r\nlittle matters of business involved in a change of hemisphere. What had\r\nbecome of her feminine reliance upon him?\r\n\r\nHe felt as if some object was rapidly approaching to collide with and\r\ncrush him, and he was powerless to hinder it.\r\n\r\nThree days, two days, one day more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe special train for Southampton, drawn up against the main-line\r\nplatform at Waterloo, seemed to have resigned itself with an almost\r\nanimal passivity to the onslaught of the crowd of well-dressed men and\r\nwomen who were boarding it. From the engine a thin column of steam\r\nrose lazily to the angular roof, where a few sparrows fluttered with\r\nsudden swoops and short flights. The engine-driver leaned against the\r\nside of the cab, stroking his beard; the stoker was trimming coal\r\non the tender. Those two knew the spectacle by heart: the scattered\r\npiles of steamer trunks amidst which passengers hurried hither and\r\nthither with no apparent object; the continual purposeless opening and\r\nshutting of carriage doors; the deferential gestures of the glittering\r\nguard as he bent an ear to ladies whose footmen stood respectfully\r\nbehind them; the swift movements of the bookstall clerk selling\r\npapers, and the meditative look of the bookstall manager as he swept\r\nhis hand along the shelf of new novels and selected a volume which he\r\ncould thoroughly recommend to the customer in the fur coat; the long\r\ncolloquies between husbands and wives, sons and mothers, daughters and\r\nfathers, fathers and sons, lovers and lovers, punctuated sometimes\r\nby the fluttering of a handkerchief, or the placing of a hand on a\r\nshoulder; the unconcealed agitation of most and the carefully studied\r\ncalm of a few; the grimaces of porters when passengers had turned away;\r\nthe slow absorption by _their_ train of all the luggage and nearly all\r\nthe people; the creeping of the clock towards the hour; the kisses;\r\nthe tears; the lowering of the signal,--to them it was no more than a\r\ncommon street-scene.\r\n\r\nRichard, having obtained leave from the office, arrived at a quarter\r\nto twelve. He peered up and down. Could it be that she was really\r\ngoing? Not even yet had he grown accustomed to the idea, and at times\r\nhe still said to himself, "It isn\'t really true; there must be some\r\nmistake." The moment of separation, now that it was at hand, he accused\r\nof having approached sneakingly to take him unawares. He was conscious\r\nof no great emotion, such as his \xe6sthetic sense of fitness might have\r\nled him to expect,--nothing but a dull joylessness, the drab, negative\r\nsensations of a convict foretasting a sentence of years.\r\n\r\nThere she stood, by the bookstall, engaged in lively talk with the\r\nclerk, while other customers waited. Lottie was beside her, holding a\r\nbag. The previous night they had slept at Morley\'s Hotel.\r\n\r\n"Everything is all right, I hope?" he said, eyeing her narrowly, and\r\nfeeling extremely sentimental.\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you.... Lottie, you must go and keep watch over our\r\nseats.... Well," she went on briskly, when they were left alone, "I am\r\nactually going. I feel somehow as if it can\'t be true."\r\n\r\n"Why, that is exactly how I have felt for days!" he answered, allowing\r\nhis voice to languish, and then fell into silence. He assiduously\r\ncoaxed himself into a mood of resigned melancholy. With sidelong\r\nglances, as they walked quietly down the platform, he scanned her face,\r\ndecided it was divine, and dwelt lovingly on the thought: "I shall\r\nnever see it again."\r\n\r\n"A dull day for you to start!" he murmured, in tones of gentle concern.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and do you know, a gentleman in the hotel told me we should be\r\ncertain to have bad weather, and that made me so dreadfully afraid that\r\nI nearly resolved to stay in England." She laughed.\r\n\r\n"Ah, if you would!" he had half a mind to exclaim, but just then he\r\nbecame aware of his affectation and trampled on it. The conversation\r\nproceeded naturally to the subject of seasickness and the little joys\r\nand perils of the voyage. Strange topics for a man and a woman about to\r\nbe separated, probably for ever! And yet Richard, for his part, could\r\nthink of none more urgent.\r\n\r\n"I had better get in now, had I not?" she said. The clock stood at five\r\nminutes to noon. Her face was sweetly serious as she raised it to his,\r\nholding out her hand.\r\n\r\n"Take care of yourself," was his fatuous parting admonition.\r\n\r\nHer hand rested in his own, and he felt it tighten. Beneath the veil\r\nthe colour deepened a little in her rosy cheeks.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t tell you," she said abruptly, "that my uncles had begged me\r\nto go to them weeks and weeks ago. I didn\'t tell you--and I put them\r\noff--because I thought I would wait and see if you and I--cared for\r\neach other."\r\n\r\nIt had come, the explanation! He blushed red, and stuck to her hand.\r\nThe atmosphere was suddenly electric. The station and the crowd were\r\nblotted out.\r\n\r\n"You understand?" she questioned, smiling bravely.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nHe was dimly conscious of having shaken hands with Lottie, of the\r\nbanging of many doors, of Adeline\'s face framed in a receding window.\r\nThen the rails were visible beside the platform, and he had glimpses of\r\npeople hurriedly getting out of the train at the platform opposite. In\r\nthe distance the signal clattered to the horizontal. He turned round,\r\nand saw only porters, and a few forlorn friends of the voyagers; one\r\nwoman was crying.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstead of going home from the office, he rambled about the\r\nthoroughfares which converge at Piccadilly Circus, basking in the\r\nnight-glare of the City of Pleasure. He had four pounds in his pocket.\r\nThe streets were thronged with swiftly rolling vehicles. Restaurants\r\nand theatres and music halls, in evening array, offered their gorgeous\r\nenticements, and at last he entered the Caf\xe9 Royal, and, ordering\r\nan elaborate dinner, ate it slowly, with thoughtful enjoyment. When\r\nhe had finished, he asked the waiter to bring a "Figaro." But there\r\nappeared to be nothing of interest in that day\'s "Figaro," and he laid\r\nit down.... The ship had sailed by this time. Had Adeline really made\r\nthat confession to him just before the train started, or was it a fancy\r\nof his? There was something fine about her disconcerting frankness ...\r\nfine, fine.... And the simplicity of it! He had let slip a treasure.\r\nBecause she lacked artistic sympathies, he had despised her, or at\r\nbest underestimated her. And once--to think of it!--he had nearly\r\nloved her.... With what astonishing rapidity their intimacy had waxed,\r\ndrooped, and come to sudden death!... Love, what _was_ love? Perhaps he\r\nloved her now, after all....\r\n\r\n"Waiter!" He beckoned with a quaint movement of his forefinger which\r\nbrought a smile to the man\'s face--a smile which Richard answered\r\njovially.\r\n\r\n"Sir?"\r\n\r\n"A shilling cigar, please, and a coffee and cognac."\r\n\r\nAt about nine o\'clock he went out again into the chill air, and the\r\ncigar burnt brightly between his lips. He had unceremoniously dismissed\r\nthe too importunate image of Adeline, and he was conscious of a certain\r\ndevil-may-care elation.\r\n\r\nWomen were everywhere on the pavements. They lifted their silk skirts\r\nout of the mud, revealing ankles and lace petticoats. They smiled\r\non him. They lured him in foreign tongues and in broken English. He\r\nbroadly winked at some of the more youthful ones, and they followed\r\nhim importunately, only to be shaken off with a laugh. As he walked,\r\nhe whistled or sang all the time. He was cut adrift, he explained to\r\nhimself, and through no fault of his own. His sole friend had left him\r\n(much she cared!), and there was none to whom he owed the slightest\r\nconsideration. He was at liberty to do what he liked, without having\r\nto consider first, "What would _she_ think of this?" Moreover, he must\r\ndiscover solace, poor blighted creature! Looking down a side street, he\r\nsaw a man talking to a woman. He went past them, and heard what they\r\nsaid. Then he was in Shaftesbury Avenue. Curious sensations fluttered\r\nthrough his frame. With an insignificant oath, he nerved himself to a\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\nSeveral times he was on the very point of carrying it out when his\r\ncourage failed. He traversed the Circus, got as far as St. James\'s\r\nHall, and returned upon his steps. In a minute he was on the north side\r\nof Coventry Street. He looked into the faces of all the women, but in\r\neach he found something to repel, to fear.\r\n\r\nWould it end in his going quietly home? He crossed over into the\r\nseclusion of Whitcomb Street to argue the matter. As he was passing the\r\nentry to a court, a woman came out, and both had to draw back to avoid\r\na collision.\r\n\r\n"_Ch\xe9ri_!" she murmured. She was no longer young, but her broad,\r\nFlemish face showed kindliness and good humour in every feature of it,\r\nand her voice was soft. He did not answer, and she spoke to him again.\r\nHis spine assumed the consistency of butter; a shuddering thrill ran\r\nthrough him. She put her arm gently into his, and pressed it. He had no\r\nresistance....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the morning of Boxing Day, frosty, with a sky of steel grey; the\r\nstreets were resonant under the traffic.\r\n\r\nRichard had long been anticipating the advent of the New Year, when\r\nnew resolutions were to come into force. A phrase from a sermon heard\r\nat Bursley stuck in his memory: _Every day begins a new year_. But he\r\ncould not summon the swift, courageous decision necessary to act upon\r\nthat adage. For a whole year he had been slowly subsiding into a bog\r\nof lethargy, and to extricate himself would, he felt, need an amount\r\nof exertion which he could not put forth unless fortified by all the\r\nassociations of the season for such feats, and by the knowledge that\r\nfellow-creatures were bracing themselves for a similar difficult wrench.\r\n\r\nNow that he looked back upon them, the fourteen months which had\r\nelapsed since Adeline\'s departure seemed to have succeeded one another\r\nwith marvellous rapidity. At first he had chafed under the loss of her,\r\nand then gradually and naturally he had grown used to her absence. She\r\nwrote to him, a rather long letter, full of details about the voyage\r\nand the train journey and her uncles\' home; he had opened the envelope\r\nhalf expecting that the letter might affect him deeply; but it did not;\r\nit struck him as a distinctly mediocre communication. He sent a reply,\r\nand the correspondence ended. He did not love her, probably never had\r\nloved her. A little sentiment: that was all. The affair was quite over.\r\nIf it had been perhaps unsatisfactory, the fault was not his. A man,\r\nhe reflected, cannot by taking thought fall in love (and yet this was\r\nexactly what he had attempted to do!), and that in any case Adeline\r\nwould not have suited him. Still, at moments when he recalled her face\r\nand gestures, her exquisite feminality, and especially her fine candour\r\nat their parting, he grew melancholy and luxuriously pitied himself.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the year which was now drawing to a close he\r\nhad attacked the art of literature anew, and had compassed several\r\narticles; but as one by one they suffered rejection, his energy had\r\ndwindled, and in a short time he had again entirely ceased to write.\r\nNor did he pursue any ordered course of study. He began upon a number\r\nof English classics, finishing few of them, and continued to consume\r\nFrench novels with eagerness. Sometimes the French work, by its neat,\r\nsevere effectiveness, would stir in him a vague desire to do likewise,\r\nbut no serious sustained effort was made.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, when loneliness is peculiarly wearisome, he had joined\r\na literary and scientific institution, for young men only, upon whose\r\npremises it was forbidden either to drink intoxicants or to smoke\r\ntobacco. He paid a year\'s subscription, and in less than a fortnight\r\nloathed not only the institution but every separate member and official\r\nof it. Then he thought of transplanting himself to the suburbs, but\r\nthe trouble of moving the library of books which by this time he\r\nhad accumulated deterred him, as well as a lazy aversion for the\r\ndiscomforts which a change would certainly involve.\r\n\r\nAnd so he had sunk into a sort of coma. His chief task was to kill\r\ntime. Eight hours were due to the office and eight to sleep, and eight\r\nothers remained to be disposed of daily. In the morning he rose late,\r\nretarding his breakfast hour, diligently read the newspaper, and\r\ntook the Park on the way to business. In the evening, as six o\'clock\r\napproached, he no longer hurried his work in order to be ready to\r\nleave the office immediately the clock struck. On the contrary, he\r\noften stayed after hours when there was no necessity to stay, either\r\nleisurely examining his accounts, or gossiping with Jenkins or one of\r\nthe older clerks. He watched the firm\'s welfare with a jealous eye,\r\noffered suggestions to Mr. Curpet which not seldom were accepted, and\r\ngrew to be regarded as exceptionally capable and trustworthy. He could\r\ndivine now and then in the tone or the look of the principals (who were\r\nniggardly with praise) an implicit trust, mingled--at any rate, in\r\nthe case of the senior partner--with a certain respect. He grew more\r\nsedate in manner, and to the office boys, over whom he had charge,\r\nhe was even forbidding; they disliked him, finding him a martinet\r\nmore strict and less suave than Mr. Curpet himself. He kept them\r\nlate at night sometimes without quite sufficient cause, and if they\r\nshowed dissatisfaction, told them sententiously that boys who were so\r\ndesperately anxious to do as little as they could would never get on in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nUpon leaving the office he would stroll slowly through Booksellers\' Row\r\nand up the Strand, with the gait of a man whose time is entirely his\r\nown. Once or twice a week he dined at one of the foreign restaurants in\r\nSoho, prolonging the meal to an unconscionable length, and repairing\r\nafterwards to some lounge for a cigar and a liqueur. He paid particular\r\nattention to his dress, enjoying the sensation of wearing good clothes,\r\nand fell into a habit of comparing his personal appearance with that of\r\nthe men whom he rubbed shoulders with in fashionable caf\xe9s and bars.\r\nHis salary sufficed for these petty extravagances, since he was still\r\nliving inexpensively in one room at Raphael Street; but besides what\r\nhe earned, his resources included the sum received from the estate of\r\nWilliam Vernon. Seventy pounds of this had melted in festivities with\r\nAdeline, two hundred pounds was lent upon mortgage under Mr. Curpet\'s\r\nguidance, and the other fifty was kept in hand, being broken into as\r\ninfrequent occasion demanded. The mortgage investment did much to\r\nheighten his status not only with the staff but with his principals.\r\n\r\nSeated in a wine-room or lager-beer hall, meditatively sipping from\r\nglass or tankard, and savouring a fragrant cigar, he contrived to\r\nextract a certain pleasure from the contemplation of his equality with\r\nthe men around him. Many of them, he guessed with satisfaction, were in\r\na worse or a less secure position than his own. He studied faces and\r\nmade a practice of entering into conversation with strangers, and these\r\nchance encounters almost invariably left him with the impression that\r\nhe had met a mental inferior. Steeping himself, as it were, in all the\r\nfrivolous, lusory activities of the West End, he began to acquire that\r\nindefinable, unmistakable air of _savoir-faire_ characteristic of the\r\nprosperous clerk who spends his leisure in public places. People from\r\nthe country frequently mistook him for the young man-about-town of\r\nthe society papers, familiar with every form of metropolitan chicane,\r\nluxury, and vice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he went out into the Park with his skates. The\r\nSerpentine had been frozen hard for more than a week, and yesterday, a\r\nsolitary unit in tens of thousands, he had celebrated Christmas on the\r\nice, skating from noon till nearly midnight, with brief intervals for\r\nmeals. The exercise and the fresh air had invigorated and enlivened\r\nhim, and this morning, as he plunged once more into the loose throng\r\nof skaters, his spirits were buoyant. It had been his intention to\r\npass yet another day on the Serpentine; but a sudden, surprising fancy\r\nentered his head, flitted away, and returned again and again with such\r\nan increasing allurement that he fell in love with it: Why not commence\r\nto write now? Why, after all, leave the new beginning till the New\r\nYear? Was it true--what he had mournfully taken for granted for a month\r\npast, and so lately as an hour ago--that he lacked the moral strength\r\nto carry a good resolution into effect at any time he chose?... In a\r\nmoment, he had sworn to work four hours before he slept that night.\r\n\r\nThe decision reached, his humour became unequivocally gay. He shot\r\nforward with longer, bolder strokes, enjoying with a keener zest the\r\nswift motion and the strange black-and-white, sylvan-urban scene about\r\nhim. He forgot the year of idleness which lay immediately behind him,\r\nforgot every previous failure, in the passionate exultation of his\r\nnew resolve. He whistled. He sang. He attempted impossible figures,\r\nand only laughed when they ended in a fall. A woman, skating alone,\r\nstumbled to her knees; he glided towards her, lifted her lightly,\r\nraised his hat, and was gone before she could thank him: it was neatly\r\ndone; he felt proud of himself. As the clock struck twelve he took off\r\nhis skates, and walked in a quiet corner of the Park, deliberating\r\nintently upon the plot of a story, which fortunately had been in his\r\nmind for several months.\r\n\r\nWhen he came in to dinner, he gave Lily five shillings for a Christmas\r\nbox, almost without thinking, and though he had no previous intention\r\nof doing so; and inquired when she was to be married. He ordered tea\r\nfor four o\'clock, so that the evening might be long. In the afternoon\r\nhe read and dozed. At a quarter to five the tea-things were cleared\r\naway, the lamp was burning brightly, the blinds drawn, and his\r\nwriting-materials arranged on the table. He lit a pipe and sat down by\r\nthe fire. At last, at last, the old, long-abandoned endeavours were\r\nabout to be resumed!\r\n\r\nThe story which he was going to write was called "Tiddy-fol-lol." The\r\nleading character was an old smith, to be named Downs, employed in\r\nthe forge of a large iron foundry at Bursley. Downs was a Primitive\r\nMethodist of the narrowest type, and when his daughter fell in love\r\nwith and married a sceneshifter at the local theatre, she received\r\nfor dowry a father\'s curse. Once, in the foundry, Downs in speaking\r\nof the matter had referred to his daughter as no better than a\r\n"Tiddy-fol-lol," and for years afterwards a favourite sport of the\r\napprentice boys was to run after him, at a safe distance, calling\r\n"Tiddy-fol-lol, Tiddy-fol-lol." The daughter, completely estranged\r\nfrom her parent, died in giving birth to a son who grew up physically\r\nstrong and healthy, but half an idiot. At the age of twelve, quite\r\nignorant of his grandfather\'s identity, he was sent by his father to\r\nwork at the foundry. The other lads saw a chance for fun. Pointing\r\nout Downs to him in the forge, they told him to go close to the man\r\nand say "Tiddy-fol-lol." "What dost thee want?" Downs questioned\r\ngruffly, when the boy stood before him with a vacant grin on his face.\r\n"Tiddy-fol-lol," came the response, in the aggravating, uninflected\r\ntones peculiar to an imbecile. Downs raised his tremendous arm in a\r\nflash of anger, and felled the youngster with a blow on the side of\r\nthe head. Then he bade him rise. But the child, caught just under the\r\near, had been struck dead. Downs was tried for manslaughter, pronounced\r\ninsane, and subsequently released as a harmless lunatic. The Salvation\r\nArmy took charge of him, and he lived by selling "War-Cries" in the\r\nstreets, still pursued by boys who shouted "Tiddy-fol-lol."\r\n\r\nProperly elaborated, Richard opined, such a plot would make a powerful\r\nstory. In his brain the thing was already complete. The one difficulty\r\nlay in the selection of a strong opening scene; that done, he was sure\r\nthe incidents of the tale would fall naturally into place. He began to\r\ncogitate, but his thoughts went wool-gathering most pertinaciously,\r\nthough time after time he compelled them to return to the subject in\r\nhand by force of knitted brows. He finished his pipe and recharged it.\r\nThe fire burnt low, and he put on more coal. Still no suitable opening\r\nscene presented itself. His spirits slowly fell. What ailed him?\r\n\r\nAt length, an idea! He was not going to fail, after all. The story must\r\nof course begin with a quarrel between old Downs and his daughter.\r\nHe drew up to the table, took a pen, and wrote the title; then a few\r\nsentences, hurriedly, and then a page. Then he read what was written,\r\npronounced it unconvincing rubbish, and tore it up. Words were\r\nuntractable, and, besides, he could not _see_ the scene. He left the\r\ntable, and after studying a tale of de Maupassant\'s, started on a new\r\nsheet, carefully imitating the manner of that writer. But he could by\r\nno means satisfy himself. Mrs. Rowbotham appeared with the supper-tray,\r\nand he laid his writing-materials on the bed. During supper he took up\r\nde Maupassant once more, and at ten o\'clock made yet a third attempt,\r\nwell knowing beforehand that it would not be successful. The plot\r\ntumbled entirely to pieces; the conclusion especially was undramatic;\r\nbut how to alter it?...\r\n\r\nHe was disgusted with himself. He wondered what would happen to him if\r\nhe lost his situation. Supposing that the firm of Curpet and Smythe\r\nfailed! Smythe was a careless fellow, capable of ruining business in a\r\nmonth if for any reason Curpet\'s restraining influence was withdrawn.\r\nThese and similar morbid fancies assailed him, and he went to bed sick\r\nwith misery, heartily wishing that he had been less precipitate in his\r\nattempt to be industrious. He had a superstition that if he had waited\r\nfor the New Year, the adventure might have resulted more happily.\r\n\r\nIn the night he awoke, to lament upon his solitariness. Why had he\r\nno congenial friends? How could he set about obtaining sympathetic\r\ncompanionship? He needed, in particular, cultured feminine society.\r\nGiven that, he could work; without it he should accomplish nothing. He\r\nreflected that in London there were probably thousands of "nice girls,"\r\npining for such men as he. What a ridiculous civilisation it was that\r\nprevented him from meeting them! When he saw a promising girl in a\r\nbus, why in the name of heaven should he not be at liberty to say to\r\nher, "Look here, I can convince you that I mean well; let us make each\r\nother\'s acquaintance"?... But convention, convention! He felt himself\r\nto be imprisoned by a relentless, unscaleable wall.... Then he dreamt\r\nthat he was in a drawing-room full of young men and women, and that all\r\nwere chattering vivaciously and cleverly. He himself stood with his\r\nback to the fire, and talked to a group of girls. They looked into his\r\nface, as Adeline used to look. They grasped his ideals and his aims\r\nwithout laborious explanations; half a word was sufficient to enlighten\r\nthem; he saw the gleam of appreciative comprehension in their eyes long\r\nbefore his sentences were finished....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning was bright with sunshine; the frost had broken, and\r\nthe streets were beginning to be muddy. Richard went out, his mind\r\nempty, and dully dejected. At Sloane Street he mounted a bus, taking\r\nthe one vacant front seat on the top. For a little while he stared\r\nabsently at the handle of his stick. Presently a chance movement of\r\nthe head made him aware that someone\'s eyes were upon him. He looked\r\nround. In the far corner of the seat opposite was Miss Roberts. She\r\nhesitated, flushing, and then bowed, and he responded. No further\r\ncommunications were possible just then (and for this, at the moment,\r\nhe felt thankful), because they were separated by two young gentlemen\r\nwearing tweed caps, and collars which might have been clean once, who\r\nwere arguing briskly over a copy of the "Sportsman."\r\n\r\nFor some strange reason of diffidence, Richard had not been to the\r\nCrabtree since his visit there with Adeline. He was sardonically in\r\nsearch of his motive for staying away when the young gentlemen with\r\nthe "Sportsman" left the bus. Miss Roberts grew rosy as he got up and\r\noffered her his hand, at the same time seating himself by her side.\r\nShe wore a black jacket and skirt, well worn but in good preservation,\r\na hat with red flowers, and grey woollen gloves; and any person of\r\nordinary discernment would have guessed her occupation without a great\r\ndeal of difficulty. During the last year she had become stouter, and\r\nher figure was now full rather than slender; her features, especially\r\nthe nostrils, mouth, and chin, were somewhat heavy, but she had\r\nprettily shaped ears, and her eyes, of no definable tint, were soft and\r\ntender; her reddish-brown hair was as conspicuous and as splendid as\r\never, coiled with tight precision at the back of her head, and escaping\r\nhere and there above her ears in tiny flying wisps. The expression of\r\nher face was mainly one of amiability, but passive, animal-like, inert;\r\nshe seemed full of good-nature.\r\n\r\n"We haven\'t seen you at the Crabtree, lately," she said.\r\n\r\n"You are still at the old place, then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; and shall be, I expect. They\'ve taken another floor now, and\r\nwe\'re the biggest vegetarian restaurant in London."\r\n\r\nThere was a note of timid agitation in her voice, and he noticed\r\nbesides that her cheeks were red and her eyes shone. Could it be that\r\nthis encounter had given her pleasure? The idea of such a possibility\r\nafforded him secret delight.... She, a breathing woman, glad to see\r\nhim! He wondered what the other people on the bus were thinking of\r\nthem, and especially what the driver thought; the driver had happened\r\nto catch sight of them when they were shaking hands, and as Richard\r\nexamined the contour of the man\'s rubicund face, he fancied he saw\r\nthere a glimmer of a smile. This was during a little pause in the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"And how have you spent Christmas?" It was Richard\'s question.\r\n\r\n"At home," she answered simply, "with father and mother. My married\r\nsister and her husband came over for the day."\r\n\r\n"And I spent mine all alone," he said ruefully. "No friends, no\r\npudding, no nothing."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him compassionately.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you live in rooms? It must be very lonely."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" he returned lightly, yet seizing with eager satisfaction the\r\nsympathy she offered, "it\'s nothing when you\'re used to it. This makes\r\nmy third Christmas in London, and none of them has been particularly\r\nuproarious. Fortunately there was the skating this year. I was on the\r\nSerpentine nearly all day."\r\n\r\nThen she asked him if skating was easy to learn, because she had been\r\nwanting to try for years, but had never had opportunity. He answered\r\nthat it was quite easy, if one were not afraid.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going your way," he said, as they both got off at Piccadilly\r\nCircus, and they walked along Coventry Street together. The talk\r\nflagged; to rouse it Richard questioned her about the routine of the\r\nrestaurant,--a subject on which she spoke readily, and with a certain\r\nsense of humour. When they reached the Crabtree,--\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s been painted!" Richard exclaimed. "It looks very swagger,\r\nindeed, now."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my! doesn\'t it? And it\'s beautiful inside, too. You must come in\r\nsometime."\r\n\r\n"I will," he said with emphasis.\r\n\r\nShe shook his hand quite vigorously, and their eyes met with a\r\ncurious questioning gaze. He smiled to himself as he walked down\r\nChandos Street; his dejection had mysteriously vanished, and he even\r\nexperienced a certain uplifting of spirit. It occurred to him that he\r\nhad never at all understood Miss Roberts before. How different she was\r\noutside the restaurant! Should he go to the Crabtree for lunch that\r\nday, or should he allow a day or two to elapse? He decidedly prudently\r\nto wait.\r\n\r\nHe debated whether he should mention the meeting to Jenkins, and said\r\non the whole that he would not do so. But he found Jenkins surprisingly\r\nurbane, and without conscious volition he was soon saying,--\r\n\r\n"Guess who I came down with on the bus this morning."\r\n\r\nJenkins gave it up.\r\n\r\n"Laura Roberts;" and then, seeing no look of comprehension on Jenkins\'\r\nface, "You know, the cashier at the Crabtree."\r\n\r\n"Oh--_her_!"\r\n\r\nThe stress was a little irritating.\r\n\r\n"_I_ saw her about a fortnight ago," Jenkins said.\r\n\r\n"At the Crabtree?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Did she say anything to you about me?" The youth smiled.\r\n\r\n"No. Why?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. We had a talk, and I mashed her a bit,--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my boy, you won\'t get far with her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sha\'n\'t I? I could tell you a thing or two _re_ Laura Roberts, if\r\nI liked."\r\n\r\nAlthough Jenkins\' remark was characteristic, and Richard knew well\r\nenough that there was nothing behind his words, yet his mind reverted\r\ninstantly to the stories connecting Miss Roberts with Mr. Aked.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t gas," he said curtly. "She looks on you as a boy."\r\n\r\n"Man enough for any woman," said Jenkins, twirling the rudiments of a\r\nmoustache.\r\n\r\nThe discussion might have gone further, had it not been interrupted by\r\nMr. Smythe, who burst suddenly into the room, as his custom was.\r\n\r\n"Larch, come with me into Mr. Curpet\'s room." His tone was brusque. He\r\nhad none of Mr. Curpet\'s natural politeness, though on rare occasions,\r\nof which the present was not one, he sought clumsily to imitate it.\r\nRichard felt a vague alarm.\r\n\r\nWith a muffler round his throat, Mr. Curpet was seated before the fire,\r\nblowing his nose and breathing noisily. Mr. Smythe went to the window,\r\nand played with the tassel of the blind cord.\r\n\r\n"We are thinking of making some changes, Larch," Mr. Curpet began.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir." His heart sank. Was he to be dismissed? The next sentence\r\nwas reassuring.\r\n\r\n"In future all costs will be drawn and settled in the office, instead\r\nof being sent out. Do you feel equal to taking charge of that\r\ndepartment?"\r\n\r\nRichard had many times helped in the preparation of bills of cost, and\r\npossessed a fair knowledge of this complicated and engaging subject. He\r\nanswered very decidedly in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n"What we propose," Mr. Smythe broke in, "is that you should have an\r\nassistant, and that the two of you should attend to both the books and\r\nthe costs."\r\n\r\n"Of course your salary will be increased," Mr. Curpet added.\r\n\r\n"Let me see, what do you get now?" This from Mr. Smythe, whose memory\r\nwas imperfect.\r\n\r\n"Three pounds ten, sir."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we say four pounds ten," said Mr. Smythe to Mr. Curpet, and\r\nthen turning to Larch: "That\'s very good indeed, you know, young man;\r\nyou wouldn\'t get that everywhere. By Jove, no, you wouldn\'t!" Richard\r\nwas fully aware of the fact. He could scarcely credit his own luck.\r\n"And we shall expect you to keep things up to the mark."\r\n\r\nMr. Curpet smiled kindly over his handkerchief, as if to intimate that\r\nMr. Smythe need not have insisted on that point.\r\n\r\n"And you may have to stay late sometimes," Mr. Smythe went on.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nWhen the interview was finished, he retraced his career at the office,\r\nmarvelling that he should have done anything unusual enough to inspire\r\nhis principals to such appreciation, and he soon made out that,\r\ncompared with others of the staff, he had indeed been a model clerk.\r\nA delicious self-complacence enveloped him. Mr. Smythe had had the air\r\nof conferring a favour; but Mr. Curpet was at the head of affairs at\r\nNo. 2 Serjeant\'s Court, and Mr. Curpet\'s attitude had been decidedly\r\nflattering. At first he had a difficulty in grasping his good fortune,\r\nthought it too good to be true; but he ended by believing in himself\r\nvery heartily. In the matter of salary, he stood now second only to Mr.\r\nAlder, he a youth not three years out of the provinces. Three years\r\nago an income of \xa3234 per annum would have seemed almost fabulous. His\r\nnotions as to what constituted opulence had changed since then, but\r\nnevertheless \xa3234 was an excellent revenue, full of possibilities. A\r\nman could marry on that and live comfortably; many men ventured to\r\nmarry on half as much. In clerkdom he had indubitably risen with ease\r\nto the upper ranks. There was good Northern stuff in Richard Larch,\r\nafter all! As he walked home, his brain was busy with plans, beautiful\r\nplans for the New Year,--how he would save money, and how he would\r\nspend his nights in toil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere happened to be a room to let on the same floor as Richard\'s\r\nown. The rent was only five shillings per week, and he arranged to\r\ntake it and use it as a bedroom, transforming the other and larger\r\nroom into a study. Mrs. Rowbotham was asked to remove all her tables,\r\nchairs, carpets, pictures, ornaments, and accessories from both\r\nrooms, as he proposed to furnish them entirely anew at his own cost.\r\nThis did not indicate that a sudden increase of revenue had, as once\r\non a previous occasion, engendered in him a propensity to squander.\r\nOn the contrary, his determination to live economically was well\r\nestablished, and he hoped to save a hundred pounds per annum with\r\nease. But the influence of an \xe6sthetic environment upon his literary\r\nwork would, he argued, probably be valuable enough to justify the\r\nmoderate expenditure involved, and so all the leisure of the last\r\ndays of the year was given to the realisation of certain theories in\r\nregard to the furnishing of a study and a bedroom. Unfortunately the\r\ntime at his disposal was very limited--- was it not essential that\r\nthe place should be set in order by the 31st of December, that work\r\nmight commence on the 1st of January?--but he did not spare himself,\r\nand the result, when he contemplated it on New Year\'s Eve, filled him\r\nwith pleasure and pride. He felt that he could write worthily in that\r\nstudy, with its four autotype reproductions of celebrated pictures\r\non the self-coloured walls, its square of Indian carpet over Indian\r\nmatting, its long, low bookshelves, its quaint table with the elm\r\ntop, its plain rush-bottomed chairs, and its broad luxurious divan.\r\nHe marvelled that he had contrived so long to exist in the room as it\r\nwas before, and complacently attributed his ill-success as a writer to\r\nthe lack of harmonious surroundings. By the last post arrived a New\r\nYear\'s card from Mrs. Clayton Vernon. Twelve months ago she had sent a\r\nsimilar kind token of remembrance, and he had ignored it; in the summer\r\nshe had written inviting him to spend a few days at Bursley, and he\r\nhad somewhat too briefly asked to be excused. To-night, however, he\r\nwent out, bought a New Year\'s card, and despatched it to her at once.\r\nHe flowed over with benevolence, viewing the world through the rosy\r\nspectacles of high resolve. Mrs. Clayton Vernon was an excellent woman,\r\nand he would prove to her and to Bursley that they had not estimated\r\ntoo highly the possibilities of Richard Larch. He was, in truth,\r\nprodigiously uplifted. The old sense of absolute power over himself\r\nfor good or evil returned. A consciousness of exceptional ability\r\npossessed him. The future, splendid in dreams, was wholly his; and yet\r\nagain--perhaps more thoroughly than ever before--the ineffectual past\r\nwas effaced. To-morrow was the New Year, and to-morrow the new heaven\r\nand the new earth were to begin.\r\n\r\nHe had decided to write a novel. Having failed in short stories and in\r\nessays, it seemed to him likely that the novel, a form which he had\r\nnot so far seriously attempted, might suit his idiosyncrasy better. He\r\nhad once sketched out the plot of a short novel, a tale of adventure\r\nin modern London, and on examination this struck him as ingenious and\r\npromising. Moreover, it would appeal--like Stevenson\'s "New Arabian\r\nNights," which in Richard\'s mind it distantly resembled--both to the\r\ngeneral and to the literary public. He determined to write five hundred\r\nwords of it a day, five days a week; at this rate of progress he\r\ncalculated that the book would be finished in four months; allowing two\r\nmonths further for revision, it ought to be ready for a publisher at\r\nthe end of June.\r\n\r\nHe drew his chair up to the blazing fire, and looked down the vista of\r\nthose long, lamplit evenings during which the novel was to grow under\r\nhis hands. How different he from the average clerk, who with similar\r\nopportunities was content to fritter away those hours which would\r\nlead himself, perhaps, to fame! He thought of Adeline, and smiled.\r\nWhat, after all, did such as he want with women? He was in a position\r\nto marry, and if he met a clever girl of sympathetic temperament, he\r\nemphatically would marry (it did not occur to him to add the clause,\r\n"Provided she will have me"); but otherwise he would wait. He could\r\nafford to wait,--to wait till he had made a reputation, and half a\r\nscore of women, elegant and refined, were only too willing to envelop\r\nhim in an atmosphere of adoration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was part of his plan for economy to dine always at the Crabtree,\r\nwhere one shilling was the price of an elaborate repast, and he went\r\nthere on New Year\'s Day. As he walked up Charing Cross Road, his\r\nthoughts turned naturally to Miss Roberts. Would she be as cordial\r\nas when he had met her on the omnibus, or would she wear the polite\r\nmask of the cashier, treating him merely as a frequenter of the\r\nestablishment? She was engaged when he entered the dining-room, but she\r\nnoticed him and nodded. He looked towards her several times during his\r\nmeal, and once her eyes caught his and she smiled, not withdrawing\r\nthem for a few moments; then she bent over her account book.\r\n\r\nHis fellow-diners seemed curiously to have degenerated, to have grown\r\nstill narrower in their sympathies, still more careless in their\r\neating, still more peculiar or shabbier in their dress. The young women\r\nof masculine aspect set their elbows on the table more uncompromisingly\r\nthan ever, and the young men with soiled wristbands or no wristbands\r\nat all were more than ever tedious in their murmured conversations. It\r\nwas, indeed, a bizarre company that surrounded him! Then he reflected\r\nthat these people had not altered. The change was in himself. He had\r\noutgrown them; he surveyed them now as from a tower. He was a man with\r\na future, using this restaurant because it suited him temporarily to\r\ndo so, while they would use it till the end, never deviating, never\r\nleaving the rut.\r\n\r\n"So you have come at last!" Miss Roberts said to him when he presented\r\nhis check. "I was beginning to think you had deserted us."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s barely a week since I saw you," he protested. "Let me wish\r\nyou a happy New Year."\r\n\r\n"The same to you." She flushed a little, and then: "What do you think\r\nof our new decorations? Aren\'t they pretty?"\r\n\r\nHe praised them perfunctorily, even without glancing round. His eyes\r\nwere on her face. He remembered the reiterated insinuations of Jenkins,\r\nand wondered whether they had any ground of fact.\r\n\r\n"By the way, has Jenkins been here to-day?" he inquired, by way of\r\nintroducing the name.\r\n\r\n"Is that the young man who used to come with you sometimes? No."\r\n\r\nThere was no trace of self-consciousness in her bearing, and Richard\r\nresolved to handle Jenkins with severity. Another customer approached\r\nthe pay-desk.\r\n\r\n"Well, good afternoon." He lingered.\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon." Her gaze rested on him softly. "I suppose you\'ll be\r\nhere again _some_ time." She spoke low, so that the other customer\r\nshould not hear.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming every day now, I think," he answered in the same tone, with\r\na smothered laugh. "Ta-ta."\r\n\r\nThat night at half-past seven he began his novel. The opening chapter\r\nwas introductory, and the words came without much effort. This being\r\nonly a draft, there was no need for polish; so that when a sentence\r\nrefused to run smoothly at the first trial, he was content to make it\r\ngrammatical and leave it. He seemed to have been working for hours when\r\na desire took him to count up what was already written. Six hundred\r\nwords! He sighed the sigh of satisfaction, and looked at his watch,\r\nto find that it was exactly half-past eight. The discovery somewhat\r\ndamped his felicity. He began to doubt whether stuff composed at the\r\nrate of ten words a minute could have any real value. Pooh! Sometimes\r\none wrote quickly, and sometimes slowly. The number of minutes occupied\r\nwas no index of quality. Should he continue writing? Yes, he would....\r\nNo.... Why should he? He had performed the task self-allotted for the\r\nday, and more; and now he was entitled to rest. True, the actual time\r\nof labour had been very short; but then, another day the same amount of\r\nwork might consume three or four hours. He put away his writing-things,\r\nand searched about for something to read, finally lighting on "Paradise\r\nLost." But "Paradise Lost" wanted actuality. He laid it aside. Was\r\nthere any valid reason why he should not conclude the evening at the\r\ntheatre? None. The frost had returned with power, and the reverberation\r\nof the streets sounded invitingly through his curtained windows. He\r\nwent out, and walked briskly up Park Side. At Hyde Park Corner he\r\njumped on an omnibus.\r\n\r\nIt was the first night of a new ballet at the Ottoman. "Standing-room\r\nonly," said the man at the ticket-office. "All right," said Richard,\r\nand, entering, was greeted with soft music, which came to him like a\r\nfitful zephyr over a sea of heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Saturday afternoon towards the end of February, he suddenly decided\r\nto read through so much of the draft novel as was written; hitherto\r\nhe had avoided any sort of revision. The resolve to accomplish five\r\nhundred words a day had been kept indifferently well, and the total\r\nstood at about fourteen thousand. As he wrote a very bold hand, the\r\nsheets covered made quite a respectable pile. The mere bulk of them\r\ncajoled him, in spite of certain misgivings, into an optimistic\r\nsurmise as to their literary quality. Never before had he written so\r\nmuch upon one theme, and were the writing good or bad, he was, for a\r\nfew moments, proud of his achievement. The mischief lay in the fact\r\nthat week by week he had exercised less and still less care over\r\nthe work. The phrase, "Anything will do for a draft," had come to\r\nbe uttered with increasing frequency as an excuse for laxities of\r\nstyle and construction. "I will make that right in the revision,"\r\nhe had reassured himself, and had gone negligently forward, leaving\r\ninnumerable crudities in the wake of his hurrying pen. During the last\r\nfew days he had written scarcely anything, and perhaps it was a hope\r\nof stimulating a drooping inspiration by the complacent survey of work\r\nactually done that tempted him to this hazardous perusal.\r\n\r\nHe whistled as he took up the manuscript, as a boy whistles when going\r\ninto a dark cellar. The first three pages were read punctiliously,\r\nevery word of them, but soon he grew hasty, rushing to the next\r\nparagraph ere the previous one was grasped; then he began shamelessly\r\nto skip; and then he stopped, and his heart seemed to stop also.\r\nThe lack of homogeneity, of sequence, of dramatic quality, of human\r\ninterest; the loose syntax; and the unrelieved mediocrity of it all,\r\nhorrified him. The thing was dry bones, a fiasco. The certainty that\r\nhe had once more failed swept over him like a cold, green wave of the\r\nsea, and he had a physical feeling of sickness in the stomach.... It\r\nwas with much ado that he refrained from putting the whole manuscript\r\nupon the fire, and crushing it venomously into the flames with a\r\npoker. Then he steadied himself. His self-confidence was going, almost\r\ngone; he must contrive to recover it, and he sought for a way. (Where\r\nwere now the rash exultations of the New Year?) It was impossible\r\nthat his work should be irredeemably bad. He remembered having read\r\nsomewhere that the difference between a fine and a worthless novel was\r\noften a difference of elaboration simply. A conscientious re-writing,\r\ntherefore, might probably bring about a surprising amelioration. He\r\nmust immediately make the experiment. But he had long since solemnly\r\nvowed not to commence the second writing till the draft was done;\r\nthe moral value of finishing even the draft had then seemed to him\r\npriceless. No matter! Under stress of grievous necessity, that oath\r\nmust be forsworn. No other course could save him from collapse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe went out into the streets. The weather, fine and bright, suggested\r\nthe earliest infancy of spring, and Piccadilly was full of all classes\r\nand all ages of women. There were regiments of men, too, but the gay\r\nand endless stream of women obsessed him. He saw them sitting in\r\nhansoms and private carriages and on the tops of omnibuses, niched in\r\nhigh windows, shining in obscurity of shops, treading the pavements\r\nwith fairy step, either unattended or by the side of foolish,\r\nunappreciative males. Every man in London seemed to have the right to\r\na share of some woman\'s companionship, except himself. As for those\r\nmen who walked alone, they had sweethearts somewhere, or mothers and\r\nsisters, or they were married and even now on the way to wife and\r\nhearth. Only he was set apart.\r\n\r\nA light descended upon him that afternoon. The average man and the\r\naverage woman being constantly thrown into each other\'s society, custom\r\nhas staled for them the exquisite privilege of such intercourse. The\r\nrustic cannot share the townsman\'s enthusiasm for rural scenery; he\r\nsees no matter for ecstasy in the view from his cottage door; and in\r\nthe same way the average man and the average woman dine together, talk\r\ntogether, walk together, and know not how richly they are therein\r\nblessed. But with solitaries like Richard it is different. Debarred\r\nfrom fellowship with the opposite sex by circumstances and an innate\r\ndiffidence which makes the control of circumstance impossible, their\r\nstarved sensibilities acquire certain morbid tenderness. (Doubtless the\r\nrustic discerns morbidity in the attitude of the townsman towards the\r\nview from his cottage door.) Richard grasped this. In a luminous moment\r\nof self-revelation, he was able to trace the growth of the malady.\r\nFrom its first vague and fugitive symptoms, it had so grown that now,\r\non seeing an attractive woman, he could not be content to say, "What\r\nan attractive woman!" and have done with it, but he needs must build a\r\nhouse, furnish a room in the house, light a fire in the room, place\r\na low chair by the fire, put the woman in the chair, with a welcoming\r\nsmile on her upturned lips--and imagine that she was his wife. And it\r\nwas not only attractive women that laid the spell upon him. The sight\r\nof any living creature in petticoats was liable to set his hysterical\r\nfancy in motion. Every woman he met was Woman.... Of the millions of\r\nwomen in London, why was he not permitted to know a few? Why was he\r\nentirely cut off? There they were: their silk skirts brushed him as\r\nthey passed; they thanked him for little services in public vehicles;\r\nthey ministered to him in restaurants; they sang to him at concerts,\r\ndanced for him at theatres; touched his existence at every side--and\r\nyet they were remoter than the stars, unattainable as the moon.... He\r\nrebelled. He sank in despair, and rose to frenzies of anger. Then he\r\nwas a pathetic figure, and extended to himself his own pity, smiling\r\nsardonically at fate. Fate was the harder to bear because he was\r\nconvinced that, at the heart of him, he was essentially a woman\'s man.\r\nNone could enjoy the feminine atmosphere more keenly, more artistically\r\nthan he. Other men, who had those delicious rights for which he longed\r\nin vain, assessed them meanly, or even scorned them.... He looked back\r\nwith profound regret to his friendship with Adeline. He dreamt that\r\nshe had returned, that he had fallen in love with her and married her,\r\nthat her ambitions were leading him forward to success. Ah! Under the\r\nincentive of a woman\'s eyes, of what tremendous efforts is a clever man\r\nnot capable, and deprived of it to what deeps of stagnations will he\r\nnot descend! Then he awoke again to the fact that he knew no woman in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nYes, he knew one, and his thoughts began to play round her caressingly,\r\nidealising and ennobling her. She only gave him his change daily at\r\nthe Crabtree, but he knew her; there existed between them a kind of\r\nintimacy. She was a plain girl, possessing few attractions, except the\r\nsupreme one of being a woman. She was below him in station; but had\r\nshe not her refinements? Though she could not enter into his mental\r\nor emotional life, did she not exhale for him a certain gracious\r\ninfluence? His heart went forth to her. Her flirtations with Mr. Aked,\r\nher alleged dalliance with Jenkins? Trifles, nothings! She had told him\r\nthat she lived with her mother and father and a younger brother, and on\r\nmore than one occasion she had mentioned the Wesleyan chapel; he had\r\ngathered that the whole family was religious. In theory he detested\r\nreligious women, and yet--religion in a woman ... what was it? He\r\nanswered the question with a man\'s easy laugh. And if her temperament\r\nwas somewhat lymphatic, he divined that, once roused, she was capable\r\nof the most passionate feeling. He had always had a predilection for\r\nthe sleeping-volcano species of woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard was soon forced to the conclusion that the second writing\r\nof his novel was destined to be a failure. For a few days he stuck\r\ndoggedly to the task, writing stuff which, as he wrote it, he knew\r\nwould ultimately be condemned. Then one evening he stopped suddenly, in\r\nthe middle of a word, bit the penholder for a moment, and threw it down\r\nwith a "Damn!" This sort of thing could not continue.\r\n\r\n"Better come up and see my new arrangements at Raphael Street\r\nto-night," he said to Jenkins the next day. He wanted a diversion.\r\n\r\n"Any whisky going?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Delighted, I\'m sure," said Jenkins, with one of his ridiculous polite\r\nbows. He regarded these rare invitations as an honour; it was more than\r\nsix months since the last.\r\n\r\nThey drank whisky and smoked cigars which Jenkins had thoughtfully\r\nbrought with him, and chattered for a long time about office matters.\r\nAnd then, as the cigar-ash accumulated, the topics became more\r\npersonal and intimate. That night Jenkins was certainly in a serious\r\nvein; further, he was on his best behaviour, striving to be sympathetic\r\nand gentlemanly. He confided to Richard his aspirations. He wished\r\nto learn French and proposed to join a Polytechnic Institute for the\r\npurpose. Also, he had thoughts of leaving home, and living in rooms,\r\nlike Richard. He was now earning twenty-eight shillings a week; he\r\nintended to save money and to give up all intoxicants beyond half a\r\npint of bitter a day. Richard responded willingly to his mood, and\r\noffered sound advice, which was listened to with deference. Then the\r\ntalk, as often aforetime, drifted to the subject of women. It appeared\r\nthat Jenkins had a desire to "settle down" (he was twenty-one). He knew\r\nseveral fellows in the Walworth Road who had married on less than he\r\nwas earning.\r\n\r\n"What about Miss Roberts?" Richard questioned.\r\n\r\n"Oh! She\'s off. She\'s a bit too old for me, you know. She must be\r\ntwenty-six."\r\n\r\n"Look here, my boy," said Richard, good-humouredly. "I don\'t believe\r\nyou ever had anything to do with her at all. It was nothing but\r\nboasting."\r\n\r\n"What will you bet I can\'t prove it to you?" Jenkins retorted, putting\r\nout his chin, an ominous gesture with him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet you half-a-crown--no, a shilling."\r\n\r\n"Done."\r\n\r\nJenkins took a leather-case from his pocket, and handed Richard a\r\nmidget photograph of Miss Roberts. Underneath it was her signature,\r\n"Yours sincerely, Laura Roberts."\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the incident did not trouble Richard in the least.\r\n\r\nHe walked down to Victoria with Jenkins towards midnight, and on\r\nreturning to his lodging, thought for the hundredth time how futile was\r\nhis present mode of existence, how bare of all that makes life worth\r\nliving. Of what avail to occupy pretty rooms, if one occupied them\r\nalone, coming into them at night to find them empty, leaving them in\r\nthe morning without a word of farewell? In the waste of London, Laura\r\nRoberts made the one green spot. He had lost interest in his novel. On\r\nthe other hand, his interest in the daily visit to the Crabtree was\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\nAs day succeeded day he fell into a practice of deliberately seeking\r\nout and magnifying the finer qualities in her nature, while ignoring\r\nthose which were likely to offend him; indeed he refused to allow\r\nhimself to be offended. He went so far as to retard his lunch-hour\r\npermanently, so that, the rush of customers being past, he should\r\nhave better opportunity to talk to her without interruption. Then\r\nhe timidly essayed the first accents of courtship, and finding his\r\nadvances accepted, grew bolder. One Sunday morning he met her as she\r\nwas coming out of the Wesleyan chapel at Munster Park; he said the\r\nencounter was due to accident. She introduced him to her relations, who\r\nwere with her. Her father was a big, stout, dark man, dressed in black\r\nfaced-cloth, with a heavy beard, huge chubby fingers, and jagged grey\r\nfinger-nails. Her mother was a spare woman of sorrowful aspect, whose\r\nthin lips seldom moved; she held her hands in front of her, one on the\r\ntop of the other. Her brother was a lank schoolboy, wearing a damaged\r\nmortar-board hat.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards he called on her at Carteret Street. The schoolboy\r\nopened the door, and after inviting him as far as the lobby, vanished\r\ninto a back room only to reappear and run upstairs. Richard heard his\r\nloud, agitated whisper: "Laura, Laura, here\'s Mr. Larch come to see\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThey strolled to Wimbledon Common that night.\r\n\r\nHis entity seemed to have become dual. One part of him was willingly\r\nenslaved to an imperious, headstrong passion; the other stood calmly,\r\ncynically apart, and watched. There were hours when he could foresee\r\nthe whole of his future life, and measure the bitter, ineffectual\r\nregret which he was laying up; hours when he admitted that his passion\r\nhad been, as it were, artificially incited, and that there could be\r\nno hope of an enduring love. He liked Laura; she was a woman, a balm,\r\na consolation. To all else he obstinately shut his eyes, and, casting\r\naway every consideration of prudence, hastened to involve himself more\r\nand more deeply. Swiftly, swiftly, the climax approached. He hailed it\r\nwith a strange, affrighted joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were upon Chelsea Embankment in the late dusk of a Saturday\r\nevening in May. A warm and gentle wind stirred the budding trees to\r\nmagic utterances. The long, straight line of serried lamps stretched\r\naway to an enchanted bridge which with twinkling lights hung poised\r\nover the misty river. The plash of an oar came languorously up from\r\nthe water, and the voices of boys calling. At intervals, couples like\r\nthemselves passed by, either silent or conversing in low tones that\r\nseemed to carry inner, inarticulate meanings. As for them, they were\r\nsilent; he had not her arm, but they walked close together. He was\r\ndeeply and indescribably moved; his heart beat heavily, and when he\r\nlooked at her face in the gloom and saw that her eyes were liquid, it\r\nbeat yet more heavily; then lay still.\r\n\r\n"Let us sit down--shall we?" he said at length, and they turned to an\r\nempty bench under a tree. "What is she thinking?" he wondered, and then\r\nthe dominant feeling of the moment possessed him wholly. His ambitions\r\nfloated out of sight and were forgotten. He remembered nothing except\r\nthe girl by his side, whose maddening bosom rose and fell under his\r\nvery gaze. At that moment she belonged to no class; had no virtues, no\r\nfaults. All the inessentials of her being were stripped away, and she\r\nwas merely a woman, divine, desired, necessary, waiting to be captured.\r\nShe sat passive, expectant, the incarnation of the Feminine.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and felt it tremble. At the contact a thrill ran about\r\nhim, and for a second a delicious faintness robbed him of all strength.\r\nThen with inexplicable rapidity his mind went unerringly back to that\r\ntrain-journey to William\'s funeral. He saw the cottage in the fields,\r\nand the young mother, half robed and with sleep in her eyes, standing\r\nat the door. Exquisite vision!\r\n\r\nHe heard himself speaking,--\r\n\r\n"Laura...."\r\n\r\nThe little hand gave a timorous encouragement.\r\n\r\n"Laura ... you are going to marry me."\r\n\r\nThe intoxicating pressure of her lips on his was answer. Heedless of\r\npublicity, he crushed her against his breast, this palpitating creature\r\nwith the serious face. Ah, she could love!\r\n\r\nIt was done. The great irretrievable moment had gone to join a million\r\nother moments of no significance. He felt triumphant, fiercely\r\ntriumphant. His frightful solitude was at an end. One woman was his. A\r\nwoman ... his, his own!\r\n\r\nSee! A tear quivered in her eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday was stiflingly hot. At Sloane Street the roof of every Putney\r\nomnibus was already laden with passengers, and Richard on his way to\r\nCarteret Street to make the acquaintance of Laura\'s married sister,\r\nMilly Powell, her husband and young child, was forced at last to be\r\ncontent with a seat inside. The public houses were just closing for\r\nthe afternoon, and the footpaths full of holiday-makers, with here and\r\nthere a girl or a middle-aged man carrying a Bible. No vehicles were\r\nabroad except the omnibuses and an occasional hired carriage which\r\npassed by with a nonchalant, lazy air.\r\n\r\nAt the Redcliffe Arms there got in a little family party consisting of\r\na stout, seemingly prosperous man, gruffly good-humoured, his wife, and\r\na boy of about three years, whose puffy face was disfigured by large\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n"Sit here, Milly, out of the sun," the man said curtly.\r\n\r\nRichard looked up at the sound of the name. The woman\'s likeness to\r\nLaura was unmistakable; beyond doubt she must be the sister of his\r\nbetrothed. He examined her curiously. She was perhaps slightly under\r\nthirty, of a good height and well set, with a large head and a large,\r\nplain face. Her movements were clumsy. She appeared to be just upon\r\nthe line which divides the matron from the young mother. In both her\r\nfeatures and her attire there were faint reminders of girlish grace, or\r\nat least of the charm of the shy wife who nurses her first-born. Her\r\ncomplexion was clear and fresh, her ears small and delicately pink, her\r\neyes cool grey. But one did not notice these beauties without careful\r\ninspection, while the heavy jaws, the lax eyelids, the flattened\r\nnose whose tilt unpleasantly revealed the nostrils, were obvious and\r\nrepellent. She wore a black gown, which fitted badly, imparting an\r\nungainliness probably foreign to her proper figure. Her broad hat of\r\nblack straw, trimmed with poppies and corn-flowers, was strikingly\r\nmodish, and the veil, running at an angle from the extremity of the\r\nbrim down to her chin, gave to her face a cloistered quality which\r\nhad its own seductiveness. Her small hands were neatly gloved, and\r\nheld a cheap, effective parasol. The woman\'s normal expression was one\r\nof cow-like vacancy, but now and then her eyes would light up as she\r\nspoke to the child, gently restraining it, reassuring it, rallying it\r\nwith simple banter. She was still in love with her husband; frequently\r\nshe glanced at him with furtive wistfulness. She was able to enjoy\r\nthe summer weather. She was not quite dead to the common phenomena of\r\nthe roadside. But the last resistances of departing youthfulness and\r\nvivacity against the narcotic of a dull, unlovely domesticity were\r\ntaking place. In a year or two she would be the typical matron of the\r\nlower middle-class.\r\n\r\nWhen Richard had made these observations, he reflected: "Laura will be\r\nlike that--soon." Mentally he compared the two faces, and he could, as\r\nit were, see Laura\'s changing....\r\n\r\nThen followed a reverie which embraced the whole of his past life. He\r\nrecognised that, while he bore all the aspect of prosperity, he had\r\nfailed. Why had nature deprived him of strength of purpose? Why could\r\nnot he, like other men, bend circumstances to his own ends? He sought\r\nfor a reason, and he found it in his father, that mysterious, dead\r\ntransmitter of traits, of whom he knew so little, and on whose name lay\r\na blot of some kind which was hidden from him. He had been born in the\r\nshadow, and after a fitful struggle towards emergence, into the shadow\r\nhe must again retire. Fate was his enemy. Mary had died; Mary would\r\nhave helped him to be strong. Mr. Aked had died; Mr. Aked\'s inspiring\r\ninfluence would have incited and guided his efforts. Adeline had\r\nabandoned him to a fatal loneliness.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he would make no further attempt to write. Laura was not\r\neven aware that he had had ambitions in that direction. He had never\r\ntold her, because she would not have understood. She worshipped him, he\r\nfelt sure, and at times he had a great tenderness for her; but it would\r\nbe impossible to write in the suburban doll\'s-house which was to be\r\ntheirs. No! In future he would be simply the suburban husband--dutiful\r\ntowards his employers, upon whose grace he would be doubly dependent;\r\nkeeping his house in repair; pottering in the garden; taking his wife\r\nout for a walk, or occasionally to the theatre; and saving as much\r\nas he could. He would be good to his wife--she was his. He wanted to\r\nget married at once. He wanted to be master of his own dwelling. He\r\nwanted to have Laura\'s kiss when he went out of a morning to earn the\r\nbread-and-cheese. He wanted to see her figure at the door when he\r\nreturned at night. He wanted to share with her the placid, domestic\r\nevening. He wanted to tease her, and to get his ears boxed and be\r\ncalled a great silly. He wanted to creep into the kitchen and surprise\r\nher with a pinch of the cheek as she bent over the range. He wanted to\r\nwhisk her up in his arms, carry her from one room to another, and set\r\nher down breathless in a chair.... Ah! Let it be soon. And as for the\r\nmore distant future, he would not look at that. He would keep his eyes\r\non the immediate foreground, and be happy while he could. After all,\r\nperhaps things had been ordered for the best; perhaps he had no genuine\r\ntalent for writing. And yet at that moment he was conscious that he\r\npossessed the incommunicable imaginative insights of the author.... But\r\nit was done with now.\r\n\r\nThe conductor called out their destination, and as Laura\'s sister\r\ngathered the child in her arms he sprang out and hurried down Carteret\r\nStreet in order to reach the house first and so avoid a meeting on\r\nthe doorstep. He heard the trot of the child behind him. Children....\r\nPerhaps a child of his might give sign of literary ability. If so--and\r\nsurely these instincts descended, were not lost--how he would foster\r\nand encourage it!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Man from the North, by Arnold Bennett\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A MAN FROM THE NORTH ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 52247-8.txt or 52247-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/2/2/4/52247/\r\n\r\nProduced by Clare Graham and Marc D\'Hooghe at\r\nhttp://www.freeliterature.org (Images generously made\r\navailable by the Internet Archive.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
