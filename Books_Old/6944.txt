I pique myself on the first tale, which\r\nis called \xc3\xabThe Heart of Mid-Lothian.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Walter had thought of adding a\r\nromance, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Regalia,\xe2\x80\x9d on the Scotch royal insignia, which had been\r\nrediscovered in the Castle of Edinburgh. This story he never wrote. Mr.\r\nCadell was greatly pleased at ousting the Longmans--\xe2\x80\x9cthey have themselves\r\nto blame for the want of the Tales, and may grumble as they choose: we\r\nhave Taggy by the tail, and, if we have influence to keep the best author\r\nof the day, we ought to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d--[Archibald Constable, iii. 104.]\r\n\r\nThough contemplated and arranged for, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart of Mid-Lothian\xe2\x80\x9d was not\r\nactually taken in hand till shortly after Jan. 15, 1818, when Cadell\r\nwrites that the tracts and pamphlets on the affair of Porteous are to be\r\ncollected for Scott. \xe2\x80\x9cThe author was in great glee . . . he says that he\r\nfeels very strong with what he has now in hand.\xe2\x80\x9d But there was much\r\nanxiety concerning Scott\xc3\xads health. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not at all like this illness of\r\nScott\xc3\xads,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Ballantyne to Hogg. \xe2\x80\x9cI have eften seen him look\r\njaded of late, and am afraid it is serious.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHand your tongue, or I\xc3\xadll\r\ngar you measure your length on the pavement,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hogg. \xe2\x80\x9cYou fause,\r\ndown-hearted loon, that ye are, you daur to speak as if Scott were on his\r\ndeath-bed! It cannot be, it must not be! I will not suffer you to speak\r\nthat gait.\xe2\x80\x9d Scott himself complains to Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthese damned spasms. The merchant Abudah\xc3\xads hag was a henwife to them\r\nwhen they give me a real night of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart of Mid-Lothian,\xe2\x80\x9d in spite of the author\xc3\xads malady, was\r\npublished in June 1818. As to its reception, and the criticism which it\r\nreceived, Lockhart has left nothing to be gleaned. Contrary to his\r\ncustom, he has published, but without the writer\xc3\xads name, a letter from\r\nLady Louisa Stuart, which really exhausts what criticism can find to say\r\nabout the new novel. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not only read it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lady Louisa,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut am in a house where everybody is tearing it out of each other\xc3\xads\r\nhands, and talking of nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d She preferred it to all but\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaverley,\xe2\x80\x9d and congratulates him on having made \xe2\x80\x9cthe perfectly good\r\ncharacter the most interesting. . . . Had this very story been conducted\r\nby a common hand, Effie would have attracted all our concern and\r\nsympathy, Jeanie only cold approbation. Whereas Jeanie, without youth,\r\nbeauty, genius, warns passions, or any other novel-perfection, is here\r\nour object from beginning to end.\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Louisa, with her usual frankness,\r\nfinds the Edinburgh lawyers tedious, in the introduction, and thinks that\r\nMr. Saddletree \xe2\x80\x9cwill not entertain English readers.\xe2\x80\x9d The conclusion\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cflags\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the chief fault I have to find relates to the reappearance\r\nand shocking fate of the boy. I hear on all sides \xc3\xabOh, I do not like\r\nthat!\xc3\xad I cannot say what I would have had instead, but I do not like it\r\neither; it is a lame, huddled conclusion. I know you so well in it,\r\nby-the-by! You grow tired yourself, want to get rid of the story, and\r\nhardly care how.\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Lousia adds that Sir George Staunton would never\r\nhave hazarded himself in the streets of Edinburgh. \xe2\x80\x9cThe end of poor Madge\r\nWildfire is most pathetic. The meeting at Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn tremendous.\r\nDumbiedikes and Rory Beau are delightful. . . . I dare swear many of your\r\nreaders never heard of the Duke of Argyle before.\xe2\x80\x9d She ends: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had\r\nknown nothing, and the whole world had told me the contrary, I should\r\nhave found you out in that one parenthesis, \xc3\xabfor the man was mortal, and\r\nhad been a schoolmaster.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Louisa omits a character who was probably as essential to Scott\xc3\xads\r\nscheme as any--Douce Davie Deans, the old Cameronian. He had almost been\r\nannoyed by the criticism of his Covenanters in \xe2\x80\x9cOld Mortality,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nheavy artillery out of the Christian Instructor or some such obscure\r\nfield work,\xe2\x80\x9d and was determined to \xe2\x80\x9ctickle off\xe2\x80\x9d another. There are signs\r\nof a war between literary Cavaliers and literary Covenanters at this\r\ntime, after the discharge of Dr. McCrie\xc3\xads \xe2\x80\x9cheavy artillery.\xe2\x80\x9d Charles\r\nKirkpatrick Sharpe was presented by Surtees of Mainsforth with a\r\nmanuscript of Kirkton\xc3\xads unprinted \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of the Church of Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n This he set forth to edite, with the determination not to \xe2\x80\x9clet the Whig\r\ndogs have the best of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Every Covenanting scandal and absurdity, such\r\nas the old story of Mess David Williamson--\xe2\x80\x9cDainty Davie\xe2\x80\x9d--and his\r\nremarkable prowess, and presence of mind at Cherrytrees, was raked up,\r\nand inserted in notes to Kirkton. Scott was Sharpe\xc3\xads ally in this\r\nenterprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI had in the persons of my forbears a full share, you see,\r\nof religious persecution . . . for all my greatgrandfathers were under\r\nthe ban, and I think there were hardly two of them out of jail at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be most scandalous to let the godly carry it oft thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d seems to have been the editing of Kirkton. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very odd the\r\nvolume of Wodrow, containing the memoir of Russell concerning the murder,\r\nis positively vanished from the library\xe2\x80\x9d (the Advocates\xc3\xad Library).\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither book nor receipt is to be found: surely they have stolen it in\r\nthe fear of the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d The truth seems to have been that Cavaliers and\r\nCovenanters were racing for the manuscripts wherein they found smooth\r\nstones of the brook to pelt their opponents withal. Soon after Scott\r\nwrites: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not without exertion and trouble that I this day detected\r\nRussell\xc3\xads manuscript (the account of the murder of Sharpe by one of the\r\nmurderers), also Kirkton and one or two others, which Mr. McCrie had\r\nremoved from their place in the library and deposited in a snug and\r\nsecret corner.\xe2\x80\x9d The Covenanters had made a raid on the ammunition of the\r\nCavaliers. \xe2\x80\x9cI have given,\xe2\x80\x9d adds Sir Walter, \xe2\x80\x9can infernal row on the\r\nsubject of hiding books in this manner.\xe2\x80\x9d Sharpe replies that the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cvillainous biographer of John Knox\xe2\x80\x9d (Dr. McCrie), \xe2\x80\x9cthat canting rogue,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n is about to edite Kirkton. Sharpe therefore advertised his own edition at\r\nonce, and edited Kirkton by forced marches as it were. Scott reviewed the\r\nbook in the Quarterly (Jan. 1818). He remarked that Sharpe \xe2\x80\x9chad not\r\nescaped the censure of these industrious literary gentlemen of opposite\r\nprinciples, who have suffered a work always relied upon as one of their\r\nchief authorities to lie dormant for a hundred and forty years.\xe2\x80\x9d Their\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cquerulous outcries\xe2\x80\x9d (probably from the field-work of the Christian\r\nInstructor) he disregards. Among the passions of this literary \xe2\x80\x9cbicker,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n which Scott allowed to amuse him, was Davie Deans conceived. Scott was\r\nnot going to be driven by querulous outcries off the Covenanting field,\r\nwhere he erected another trophy. This time he was more friendly to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue Blue Presbyterians.\xe2\x80\x9d His Scotch patriotism was one of his most\r\nearnest feelings, the Covenanters, at worst, were essentially Scotch, and\r\nhe introduced a new Cameronian, with all the sterling honesty, the\r\nPuritanism, the impracticable ideas of the Covenant, in contact with\r\nchanged times, and compelled to compromise.\r\n\r\nHe possessed a curious pamphlet, Haldane\xc3\xads \xe2\x80\x9cActive Testimony of the true\r\nblue Presbyterians\xe2\x80\x9d (12mo, 1749). It is a most impartial work,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccontaining a declaration and testimony against the late unjust invasion\r\nof Scotland by Charles, Pretended Prince of Wales, and William, Pretended\r\nDuke of Cumberland.\xe2\x80\x9d Everything and everybody not Covenanted, the House\r\nof Stuart, the House of Brunswick, the House of Hapsburg, Papists,\r\nPrelatists and Turks, are cursed up hill and down dale, by these worthy\r\nsurvivors of the Auld Leaven. Everybody except the authors, Haldane and\r\nLeslie, \xe2\x80\x9chas broken the everlasting Covenant.\xe2\x80\x9d The very Confession of\r\nWestminster is arraigned for its laxity. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole Civil and Judicial\r\nLaw of God,\xe2\x80\x9d as given to the Jews (except the ritual, polygamy, divorce,\r\nslavery, and so forth), is to be maintained in the law of Scotland.\r\nSins are acknowledged, and since the Covenant every political\r\nstep--Cromwell\xc3\xads Protectorate, the Restoration, the Revolution, the\r\naccession of the \xe2\x80\x9cDukes of Hanover\xe2\x80\x9d--has been a sin. A Court of Elders\r\nis to be established to put in execution the Law of Moses. All offenders\r\nagainst the Kirk are to be \xe2\x80\x9ccapitally punished.\xe2\x80\x9d Stage plays are to be\r\nsuppressed by the successors of the famous convention at Lanark, Anno\r\n1682. Toleration of all religions is \xe2\x80\x9csinful,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to the word\r\nof God.\xe2\x80\x9d Charles Edward and the Duke of Cumberland are cursed. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso we\r\nreckon it a great vice in Charles, his foolish Pity and Lenity, in\r\nsparing these profane, blasphemous Redcoats, that Providence delivered\r\ninto his hand, when, by putting them to death, this poor land might have\r\nbeen eased of the heavy burden of these vermin of Hell.\xe2\x80\x9d The Auld Leaven\r\nswore terribly in Scotland. The atrocious cruelties of Cumberland after\r\nCulloden are stated with much frankness and power. The German soldiers\r\nare said to have carried off \xe2\x80\x9ca vast deal of Spoil and Plunder into\r\nGermany,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Redcoats had Plays and Diversions (cricket, probably)\r\non the Inch of Perth, on a Sabbath. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hellish, Pagan, Juggler plays\r\nare set up and frequented with more impudence and audacity than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Only the Jews, \xe2\x80\x9cour elder Brethren,\xe2\x80\x9d are exempted from the curses of\r\nHaldane and Leslie, who promise to recover for them the Holy Land. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nMassacre in Edinburgh\xe2\x80\x9d in 1736, by wicked Porteous, calls for vengeance\r\nupon the authors and abettors thereof. The army and navy are \xe2\x80\x9cthe most\r\nwicked and flagitious in the Universe.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, the True Blue Testimony\r\nis very active indeed, and could be delivered, thanks to hellish\r\nToleration, with perfect safety, by Leslie and Haldane. The candour of\r\ntheir eloquence assuredly proves that Davie Deans is not overdrawn;\r\nindeed, he is much less truculent than those who actually were\r\ntestifying even after his decease.\r\n\r\nIn \xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart of Mid-Lothian\xe2\x80\x9d Scott set himself to draw his own people at\r\ntheir best. He had a heroine to his hand in Helen Walker, \xe2\x80\x9ca character so\r\ndistinguished for her undaunted love of virtue,\xe2\x80\x9d who, unlike Jeanie\r\nDeans, \xe2\x80\x9clived and died in poverty, if not want.\xe2\x80\x9d In 1831 he erected a\r\npillar over her grave in the old Covenanting stronghold of Irongray. The\r\ninscription ends--\r\n\r\n                   Respect the Grave of Poverty,\r\n                   When combined with Love of Truth\r\n                          And Dear Affection.\r\n\r\nThe sweetness, the courage, the spirit, the integrity of Jeanie Deans\r\nhave made her, of all Scott\xc3\xads characters, the dearest to her countrymen,\r\nand the name of Jeanie was given to many children, in pious memory of the\r\nblameless heroine. The foil to her, in the person of Effie, is not less\r\nadmirable. Among Scott\xc3\xads qualities was one rare among modern authors: he\r\nhad an affectionate toleration for his characters. If we compare Effie\r\nwith Hetty in \xe2\x80\x9cAdam Bede,\xe2\x80\x9d this charming and genial quality of Scott\xc3\xads\r\nbecomes especially striking. Hetty and Dinah are in very much the same\r\nsituation and condition as Effie and Jeanie Deans. But Hetty is a\r\nfrivolous little animal, in whom vanity and silliness do duty for\r\npassion: she has no heart: she is only a butterfly broken on the wheel of\r\nthe world. Doubtless there are such women in plenty, yet we feel that her\r\ncreator persecutes her, and has a kind of spite against her. This was\r\nimpossible to Scott. Effie has heart, sincerity, passion, loyalty,\r\ndespite her flightiness, and her readiness, when her chance comes, to\r\nplay the fine lady. It was distasteful to Scott to create a character not\r\nhuman and sympathetic on one side or another. Thus his robber \xe2\x80\x9cof milder\r\nmood,\xe2\x80\x9d on Jeanie\xc3\xads journey to England, is comparatively a good fellow,\r\nand the scoundrel Ratcliffe is not a scoundrel utterly. \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabTo make a Lang\r\ntale short, I canna undertake the job. It gangs against my conscience.\xc3\xad\r\n\xc3\xabYour conscience, Rat?\xc3\xad said Sharpitlaw, with a sneer, which the reader\r\nwill probably think very natural upon the occasion. \xc3\xabOu ay, sir,\xc3\xad\r\nanswered Ratcliffe, calmly, \xc3\xabjust my conscience; a body has a conscience,\r\nthough it may be ill wunnin at it. I think mine\xc3\xads as weel out o\xc3\xad the gate\r\nas maist folk\xc3\xads are; and yet it\xc3\xads just like the noop of my elbow, it\r\nwhiles gets a bit dirl on a corner.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d Scott insists on leaving his worst\r\npeople in possession of something likeable, just as he cannot dismiss\r\neven Captain Craigengelt without assuring us that Bucklaw made a\r\nprovision for his necessities. This is certainly a more humane way of\r\nwriting fiction than that to which we are accustomed in an age of\r\nhumanitarianism. Nor does Scott\xc3\xads art suffer from his kindliness, and\r\nEffie in prison, with a heart to be broken, is not less pathetic than the\r\nheartless Hetty, in the same condemnation.\r\n\r\nAs to her lover, Robertson, or Sir George Staunton, he certainly verges\r\non the melodramatic. Perhaps we know too much about the real George\r\nRobertson, who was no heir to a title in disguise, but merely a \xe2\x80\x9cstabler\r\nin Bristol\xe2\x80\x9d accused \xe2\x80\x9cat the instance of Duncan Forbes, Esq. of Culloden,\r\nhis Majesty\xc3\xads advocate, for the crimes of Stouthrieff, Housebreaking, and\r\nRobbery.\xe2\x80\x9d Robertson \xe2\x80\x9ckept an inn in Bristo, at Edinburgh, where the\r\nNewcastle carrier commonly did put up,\xe2\x80\x9d and is believed to have been a\r\nmarried man. It is not very clear that the novel gains much by the\r\nelevation of the Bristo innkeeper to a baronetcy, except in so far as\r\nEffie\xc3\xads appearance in the character of a great lady is entertaining and\r\ncharacteristic, and Jeanie\xc3\xads conquest of her own envy is exemplary. The\r\nchange in social rank calls for the tragic conclusion, about which almost\r\nevery reader agrees with the criticism of Lady Louisa Stuart and her\r\nfriends. Thus the novel \xe2\x80\x9cfilled more pages\xe2\x80\x9d than Mr. Jedediah\r\nCleishbotham had \xe2\x80\x9copined,\xe2\x80\x9d and hence comes a languor which does not beset\r\nthe story of \xe2\x80\x9cOld Mortality.\xe2\x80\x9d Scott\xc3\xads own love of adventure and of\r\nstirring incidents at any cost is an excellent quality in a novelist, but\r\nit does, in this instance, cause him somewhat to dilute those immortal\r\nstudies of Scotch character which are the strength of his genius.\r\nThe reader feels a lack of reality in the conclusion, the fatal encounter\r\nof the father and the lost son, an incident as old as the legend of\r\nOdysseus. But this is more than atoned for by the admirable part of Madge\r\nWildfire, flitting like a _feu follet_ up and down among the douce\r\nScotch, and the dour rioters. Madge Wildfire is no repetition of Meg\r\nMerrilies, though both are unrestrained natural things, rebels against\r\nthe settled life, musical voices out of the past, singing forgotten songs\r\nof nameless minstrels. Nowhere but in Shakspeare can we find such a\r\ndistraught woman as Madge Wildfire, so near akin to nature and to the\r\nmoods of \xe2\x80\x9cthe bonny lady Moon.\xe2\x80\x9d Only he who created Ophelia could have\r\nconceived or rivalled the scene where Madge accompanies the hunters of\r\nStaunton on the moonlit hill and sings her warnings to the fugitive.\r\n\r\n                When the glede\xc3\xads in the blue cloud,\r\n                      The lavrock lies still;\r\n                When the hound\xc3\xads in the green-wood,\r\n                      The hind keeps the hill.\r\n                There\xc3\xads a bloodhound ranging Tinwald wood,\r\n                      There\xc3\xads harness glancing sheen;\r\n                There\xc3\xads a maiden sits on Tinwald brae,\r\n                      And she sings loud between.\r\n                O sleep ye sound, Sir James, she said,\r\n                      When ye suld rise and ride?\r\n                There\xc3\xads twenty men, wi\xc3\xad bow and blade,\r\n                       Are seeking where ye hide.\r\n\r\nThe madness of Madge Wildfire has its parallel in the wildness of\r\nGoethe\xc3\xads Marguerite, both of them lamenting the lost child, which, to\r\nMadge\xc3\xads fancy, is now dead, now living in a dream. But the gloom that\r\nhangs about Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn, the ghastly vision of \xe2\x80\x9ccrying up Ailie\r\nMuschat, and she and I will hae a grand bouking-washing, and bleach our\r\nclaise in the beams of the bonny Lady Moon,\xe2\x80\x9d have a terror beyond the\r\nGerman, and are unexcelled by Webster or by Ford. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the moon, and the\r\ndew, and the night-wind, they are just like a caller kail-blade laid on\r\nmy brow; and whiles I think the moon just shines on purpose to pleasure\r\nme, when naebody sees her but mysell.\xe2\x80\x9d Scott did not deal much in the\r\nfacile pathos of the death-bed, but that of Madge Wildfire has a grace of\r\npoetry, and her latest song is the sweetest and wildest of his lyrics,\r\nthe most appropriate in its setting. When we think of the contrasts to\r\nher--the honest, dull good-nature of Dumbiedikes; the common-sense and\r\nhumour of Mrs. Saddletree; the pragmatic pedantry of her husband;\r\nthe Highland pride, courage, and absurdity of the Captain of\r\nKnockdander--when we consider all these so various and perfect\r\ncreations, we need not wonder that Scott was \xe2\x80\x9cin high glee\xe2\x80\x9d over \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nHeart of Mid-Lothian,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfelt himself very strong,\xe2\x80\x9d and thought that\r\nthese would be \xe2\x80\x9cthe best volumes that have appeared.\xe2\x80\x9d The difficulty, as\r\nusual, is to understand how, in all this strength, he permitted himself\r\nto be so careless over what is really by far the easiest part of the\r\nnovelist\xc3\xads task--the construction. But so it was; about \xe2\x80\x9cThe Monastery\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit was written with as much care as the rest, that is, with no\r\ncare at all.\xe2\x80\x9d His genius flowed free in its own unconscious abundance:\r\nwhere conscious deliberate workmanship was needed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe forthright\r\ncraftsman\xc3\xads hand,\xe2\x80\x9d there alone he was lax and irresponsible. In\r\nShakspeare\xc3\xads case we can often account for similar incongruities by the\r\nconstraint of the old plot which he was using; but Scott was making his\r\nown plots, or letting them make themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cI never could lay down a\r\nplan, or, having laid it down, I never could adhere to it; the action of\r\ncomposition always diluted some passages and abridged or omitted others;\r\nand personages were rendered important or insignificant, not according\r\nto their agency in the original conception of the plan, but according to\r\nthe success or otherwise with which I was able to bring them out. I only\r\ntried to make that which I was actually writing diverting and\r\ninteresting, leaving the rest to fate. . . When I chain my mind to ideas\r\nwhich are purely imaginative--for argument is a different thing--it\r\nseems to me that the sun leaves the landscape, that I think away the\r\nwhole vivacity and spirit of my original conception, and that the\r\nresults are cold, tame, and spiritless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Sir Walter was like the Magician who can raise spirits that,\r\nonce raised, dominate him. Probably this must ever be the case, when an\r\nauthor\xc3\xads characters are not puppets but real creations. They then have a\r\nwill and a way of their own; a free-will which their creator cannot\r\npredetermine and correct. Something like this appears to have been\r\nScott\xc3\xads own theory of his lack of constructive power. No one was so\r\nassured of its absence, no one criticised it more severely than he did\r\nhimself. The Edinburgh Review about this time counselled the \xe2\x80\x9cAuthor of\r\nWaverley\xe2\x80\x9d to attempt a drama, doubting only his powers of compression.\r\nPossibly work at a drama might have been of advantage to the genius of\r\nScott. He was unskilled in selection and rejection, which the drama\r\nespecially demands. But he detested the idea of writing for actors, whom\r\nhe regarded as ignorant, dull, and conceited. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not fine and renew\r\na lease of popularity upon the theatre. To write for low, ill-informed,\r\nand conceited actors, whom you must please, for your success is\r\nnecessarily at their mercy, I cannot away with,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote to Southey.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvowedly, I will never write for the stage; if I do, \xc3\xabcall me horse,\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he remarks to Terry. He wanted \xe2\x80\x9cneither the profit nor the shame of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cI do not think that the character of the audience in London is such that\r\none could have the least pleasure in pleasing them.\xe2\x80\x9d He liked helping\r\nTerry to \xe2\x80\x9cTerryfy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart of Mid-Lothian,\xe2\x80\x9d and his other novels, but\r\nhe had no more desire than a senator of Rome would have had to see his\r\nname become famous by the Theatre. This confirmed repulsion in one so\r\nlearned in the dramatic poets is a curious trait in Scott\xc3\xads character.\r\nHe could not accommodate his genius to the needs of the stage, and that\r\ncrown which has most potently allured most men of genius he would have\r\nthrust away, had it been offered to him, with none of Caesar\xc3\xads\r\nreluctance. At the bottom of all this lay probably the secret conviction\r\nthat his genius was his master, that it must take him where it would, on\r\npaths where he was compelled to follow. Terse and concentrated, of set\r\npurpose, he could not be. A notable instance of this inability occurs in\r\nthe Introductory Chapter to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart of Mid-Lothian,\xe2\x80\x9d which has\r\nprobably frightened away many modern readers. The Advocate and the Writer\r\nto the Signet and the poor Client are persons quite uncalled for, and\r\ntheir little adventure at Gandercleugh is unreal. Oddly enough, part of\r\ntheir conversation is absolutely in the manner of Dickens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabI think,\xc3\xad said I, . . . \xc3\xabthe metropolitan county may, in that case, be\r\nsaid to have a sad heart.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabRight as my glove, Mr. Pattieson,\xc3\xad added Mr. Hardie; \xc3\xaband a close\r\nheart, and a hard heart--Keep it up, Jack.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabAnd a wicked heart, and a poor heart,\xc3\xad answered Halkit, doing his best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabAnd yet it may be called in some sort a strong heart, and a high\r\nheart,\xc3\xad rejoined the advocate. \xc3\xabYou see I can put you both out of\r\nheart.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFortunately we have no more of this easy writing, which makes such very\r\nmelancholy reading.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the Porteous mob, as given by the novelist, is not, it\r\nseems, entirely accurate. Like most artists, Sir Walter took the liberty\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9ccomposing\xe2\x80\x9d his picture. In his \xe2\x80\x9cIllustrations of the Author of\r\nWaverley\xe2\x80\x9d (1825) Mr. Robert Chambers records the changes in facts made by\r\nScott. In the first place, Wilson did not attack his guard, and enable\r\nRobertson to escape, after the sermon, but as soon as the criminals took\r\ntheir seats in the pew. When fleeing out, Robertson tripped over \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nplate,\xe2\x80\x9d set on a stand to receive alms and oblations, whereby he hurt\r\nhimself, and was seen to stagger and fall in running down the stairs\r\nleading to the Cowgate. Mr. McQueen, Minister of the New Kirk, was coming\r\nup the stairs. He conceived it to be his duty to set Robertson on his\r\nfeet again, \xe2\x80\x9cand covered his retreat as much as possible from the pursuit\r\nof the guard.\xe2\x80\x9d Robertson ran up the Horse Wynd, out at Potter Row Port,\r\ngot into the King\xc3\xads Park, and headed for the village of Duddingston,\r\nbeside the loch on the south-east of Arthur\xc3\xads Seat. He fainted after\r\njumping a dyke, but was picked up and given some refreshment. He lay in\r\nhiding till he could escape to Holland.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy to hang Porteous did not, in fact, develop in a few hours,\r\nafter his failure to appear on the scaffold. The Queen\xc3\xads pardon (or a\r\nreprieve) reached Edinburgh on Thursday, Sept. 2; the Riot occurred on\r\nthe night of Sept. 7. The council had been informed that lynching was\r\nintended, thirty-six hours before the fatal evening, but pronounced the\r\nreports to be \xe2\x80\x9ccaddies\xc3\xad clatters.\xe2\x80\x9d Their negligence, of course, must have\r\nincreased the indignation of the Queen. The riot, according to a very old\r\nman, consulted by Mr. Chambers, was headed by two butchers, named\r\nCumming, \xe2\x80\x9ctall, strong, and exceedingly handsome men, who dressed in\r\nwomen\xc3\xads clothes as a disguise.\xe2\x80\x9d The rope was tossed out of a window in a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csmall wares shop\xe2\x80\x9d by a woman, who received a piece of gold in exchange.\r\nThis extravagance is one of the very few points which suggest that people\r\nof some wealth may have been concerned in the affair. Tradition,\r\naccording to Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, believed in noble leaders of the\r\nriot. It is certain that several witnesses of good birth and position\r\ntestified very strongly against Porteous, at his trial.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hogg, Scott\xc3\xads \xe2\x80\x9cfame was now so firmly established that he\r\ncared not a fig for the opinion of his literary friends beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwas pleased, however, by the notice of \xe2\x80\x9cIvanhoe,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart of\r\nMid-Lothian,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bride of Lammermoor\xe2\x80\x9d in the Edinburgh Review of\r\n1820, as he showed by quoting part of its remarks. The Reviewer frankly\r\nobserved \xe2\x80\x9cthat, when we began with one of these works, we were conscious\r\nthat we never knew how to leave off. The Porteous mob is rather heavily\r\ndescribed, and the whole part of George Robertson, or Staunton, is\r\nextravagant and displeasing. The final catastrophe is needlessly\r\nimprobable and startling.\xe2\x80\x9d The critic felt that he must be critical, but\r\nhis praise of Effie and Jeanie Deans obviously comes from his heart.\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads character \xe2\x80\x9cis superior to anything we can recollect in the\r\nhistory of invention . . . a remarkable triumph over the greatest of all\r\ndifficulties in the conduct of a fictitious narrative.\xe2\x80\x9d The critique\r\nends with \xe2\x80\x9can earnest wish that the Author would try his hand in the\r\nlore of Shakspeare\xe2\x80\x9d; but, wiser than the woers of Penelope, Scott\r\nrefused to make that perilous adventure.\r\n                                             ANDREW LANG.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn essay by Mr. George Ormond, based on manuscripts in the Edinburgh\r\nRecord office (Scottish Review, July, 1892), adds little to what is known\r\nabout the Porteous Riot. It is said that Porteous was let down alive, and\r\nhanged again, more than once, that his arm was broken by a Lochaber axe,\r\nand that a torch was applied to the foot from which the shoe had fallen.\r\nA pamphlet of 1787 says that Robertson became a spy on smugglers in\r\nHolland, returned to London, procured a pardon through the Butcher\r\nCumberland, and \xe2\x80\x9cat last died in misery in London.\xe2\x80\x9d It is plain that\r\nColonel Moyle might have rescued Porteous, but he was naturally cautious\r\nabout entering the city gates without a written warrant from the civil\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TO THE BEST OF PATRONS,\r\n                     A PLEASED AND INDULGENT READER\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JEDEDIAH CLEISHBOTHAM\r\n              WISHES HEALTH, AND INCREASE, AND CONTENTMENT.\r\n\r\nCourteous Reader,\r\n\r\nIf ingratitude comprehendeth every vice, surely so foul a stain worst of\r\nall beseemeth him whose life has been devoted to instructing youth in\r\nvirtue and in humane letters. Therefore have I chosen, in this\r\nprolegomenon, to unload my burden of thanks at thy feet, for the favour\r\nwith which thou last kindly entertained the Tales of my Landlord. Certes,\r\nif thou hast chuckled over their factious and festivous descriptions, or\r\nhadst thy mind filled with pleasure at the strange and pleasant turns of\r\nfortune which they record, verily, I have also simpered when I beheld a\r\nsecond storey with attics, that has arisen on the basis of my small\r\ndomicile at Gandercleugh, the walls having been aforehand pronounced by\r\nDeacon Barrow to be capable of enduring such an elevation. Nor has it\r\nbeen without delectation that I have endued a new coat (snuff-brown, and\r\nwith metal buttons), having all nether garments corresponding thereto. We\r\ndo therefore lie, in respect of each other, under a reciprocation of\r\nbenefits, whereof those received by me being the most solid (in respect\r\nthat a new house and a new coat are better than a new tale and an old\r\nsong), it is meet that my gratitude should be expressed with the louder\r\nvoice and more preponderating vehemence. And how should it be so\r\nexpressed?--Certainly not in words only, but in act and deed. It is with\r\nthis sole purpose, and disclaiming all intention of purchasing that\r\npendicle or poffle of land called the Carlinescroft, lying adjacent to my\r\ngarden, and measuring seven acres, three roods, and four perches, that I\r\nhave committed to the eyes of those who thought well of the former tomes,\r\nthese four additional volumes of the Tales of my Landlord. Not the less,\r\nif Peter Prayfort be minded to sell the said poffle, it is at his own\r\nchoice to say so; and, peradventure, he may meet with a purchaser: unless\r\n(gentle reader) the pleasing pourtraictures of Peter Pattieson, now given\r\nunto thee in particular, and unto the public in general, shall have lost\r\ntheir favour in thine eyes, whereof I am no way distrustful. And so much\r\nconfidence do I repose in thy continued favour, that, should thy lawful\r\noccasions call thee to the town of Gandercleugh, a place frequented by\r\nmost at one time or other in their lives, I will enrich thine eyes with a\r\nsight of those precious manuscripts whence thou hast derived so much\r\ndelectation, thy nose with a snuff from my mull, and thy palate with a\r\ndram from my bottle of strong waters, called by the learned of\r\nGandercleugh, the Dominie\xc3\xads Dribble o\xc3\xad Drink.\r\n\r\nIt is there, O highly esteemed and beloved reader, thou wilt be able to\r\nbear testimony, through the medium of thine own senses, against the\r\nchildren of vanity, who have sought to identify thy friend and servant\r\nwith I know not what inditer of vain fables; who hath cumbered the world\r\nwith his devices, but shrunken from the responsibility thereof. Truly,\r\nthis hath been well termed a generation hard of faith; since what can a\r\nman do to assert his property in a printed tome, saving to put his name\r\nin the title-page thereof, with his description, or designation, as the\r\nlawyers term it, and place of abode? Of a surety I would have such\r\nsceptics consider how they themselves would brook to have their works\r\nascribed to others, their names and professions imputed as forgeries, and\r\ntheir very existence brought into question; even although, peradventure,\r\nit may be it is of little consequence to any but themselves, not only\r\nwhether they are living or dead, but even whether they ever lived or no.\r\nYet have my maligners carried their uncharitable censures still farther.\r\n\r\nThese cavillers have not only doubted mine identity, although thus\r\nplainly proved, but they have impeached my veracity and the authenticity\r\nof my historical narratives! Verily, I can only say in answer, that I\r\nhave been cautelous in quoting mine authorities. It is true, indeed, that\r\nif I had hearkened with only one ear, I might have rehearsed my tale with\r\nmore acceptation from those who love to hear but half the truth. It is,\r\nit may hap, not altogether to the discredit of our kindly nation of\r\nScotland, that we are apt to take an interest, warm, yea partial, in the\r\ndeeds and sentiments of our forefathers. He whom his adversaries describe\r\nas a perjured Prelatist, is desirous that his predecessors should be held\r\nmoderate in their power, and just in their execution of its privileges,\r\nwhen truly, the unimpassioned peruser of the annals of those times shall\r\ndeem them sanguinary, violent, and tyrannical. Again, the representatives\r\nof the suffering Nonconformists desire that their ancestors, the\r\nCameronians, shall be represented not simply as honest enthusiasts,\r\noppressed for conscience\xc3\xad sake, but persons of fine breeding, and valiant\r\nheroes. Truly, the historian cannot gratify these predilections. He must\r\nneeds describe the cavaliers as proud and high-spirited, cruel,\r\nremorseless, and vindictive; the suffering party as honourably tenacious\r\nof their opinions under persecution; their own tempers being, however,\r\nsullen, fierce, and rude; their opinions absurd and extravagant; and\r\ntheir whole course of conduct that of persons whom hellebore would better\r\nhave suited than prosecutions unto death for high-treason. Natheless,\r\nwhile such and so preposterous were the opinions on either side, there\r\nwere, it cannot be doubted, men of virtue and worth on both, to entitle\r\neither party to claim merit from its martyrs. It has been demanded of me,\r\nJedediah Cleishbotham, by what right I am entitled to constitute myself\r\nan impartial judge of their discrepancies of opinions, seeing (as it is\r\nstated) that I must necessarily have descended from one or other of the\r\ncontending parties, and be, of course, wedded for better or for worse,\r\naccording to the reasonable practice of Scotland, to its dogmata, or\r\nopinions, and bound, as it were, by the tie matrimonial, or, to speak\r\nwithout metaphor, _ex jure sanguinis,_ to maintain them in preference to\r\nall others.\r\n\r\nBut, nothing denying the rationality of the rule, which calls on all now\r\nliving to rule their political and religious opinions by those of their\r\ngreat-grandfathers, and inevitable as seems the one or the other horn of\r\nthe dilemma betwixt which my adversaries conceive they have pinned me to\r\nthe wall, I yet spy some means of refuge, and claim a privilege to write\r\nand speak of both parties with impartiality. For, O ye powers of logic!\r\nwhen the Prelatists and Presbyterians of old times went together by the\r\nears in this unlucky country, my ancestor (venerated be his memory!) was\r\none of the people called Quakers, and suffered severe handling from\r\neither side, even to the extenuation of his purse and the incarceration\r\nof his person.\r\n\r\nCraving thy pardon, gentle Reader, for these few words concerning me and\r\nmine, I rest, as above expressed, thy sure and obligated friend,*\r\n\r\nJ. C.\r\nGANDERCLEUGH,\r\nthis 1st of April, 1818.\r\n\r\n* Note A. Author\xc3\xads connection with Quakerism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO THE HEART OF MID-LOTHIAN--(1830).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author has stated, in the preface to the Chronicles of the Canongate,\r\n1827, that he received from an anonymous correspondent an account of the\r\nincident upon which the following story is founded. He is now at liberty\r\nto say, that the information was conveyed to him by a late amiable and\r\ningenious lady, whose wit and power of remarking and judging of character\r\nstill survive in the memory of her friends. Her maiden name was Miss\r\nHelen Lawson, of Girthhead, and she was wife of Thomas Goldie, Esq. of\r\nCraigmuie, Commissary of Dumfries.\r\n\r\nHer communication was in these words:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had taken for summer lodgings a cottage near the old Abbey of\r\nLincluden. It had formerly been inhabited by a lady who had pleasure in\r\nembellishing cottages, which she found perhaps homely and even poor\r\nenough; mine, therefore, possessed many marks of taste and elegance\r\nunusual in this species of habitation in Scotland, where a cottage is\r\nliterally what its name declares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my cottage door I had a partial view of the old Abbey before\r\nmentioned; some of the highest arches were seen over, and some through,\r\nthe trees scattered along a lane which led down to the ruin, and the\r\nstrange fantastic shapes of almost all those old ashes accorded\r\nwonderfully well with the building they at once shaded and ornamented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Abbey itself from my door was almost on a level with the cottage;\r\nbut on coming to the end of the lane, it was discovered to be situated on\r\na high perpendicular bank, at the foot of which run the clear waters of\r\nthe Cluden, where they hasten to join the sweeping Nith,\r\n\r\n                 \xc3\xabWhose distant roaring swells and fa\xc3\xads.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\nAs my kitchen and parlour were not very far distant, I one day went in to\r\npurchase some chickens from a person I heard offering them for sale. It\r\nwas a little, rather stout-looking woman, who seemed to be between\r\nseventy and eighty years of age; she was almost covered with a tartan\r\nplaid, and her cap had over it a black silk hood, tied under the chin, a\r\npiece of dress still much in use among elderly women of that rank of life\r\nin Scotland; her eyes were dark, and remarkably lively and intelligent; I\r\nentered into conversation with her, and began by asking how she\r\nmaintained herself, etc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said that in winter she footed stockings, that is, knit feet to\r\ncountry-people\xc3\xads stockings, which bears about the same relation to\r\nstocking-knitting that cobbling does to shoe-making, and is of course\r\nboth less profitable and less dignified; she likewise taught a few\r\nchildren to read, and in summer she whiles reared a few chickens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I could venture to guess from her face she had never been\r\nmarried. She laughed heartily at this, and said, \xc3\xabI maun hae the queerest\r\nface that ever was seen, that ye could guess that. Now, do tell me,\r\nmadam, how ye cam to think sae?\xc3\xad I told her it was from her cheerful\r\ndisengaged countenance. She said, \xc3\xabMem, have ye na far mair reason to be\r\nhappy than me, wi\xc3\xad a gude husband and a fine family o\xc3\xad bairns, and plenty\r\no\xc3\xad everything? for me, I\xc3\xadm the puirest o\xc3\xad a\xc3\xad puir bodies, and can hardly\r\ncontrive to keep mysell alive in a\xc3\xad the wee bits o\xc3\xad ways I hae tell\xc3\xadt\r\nye.\xc3\xad After some more conversation, during which I was more and more\r\npleased with the old womans sensible conversation, and the _naivete_ of\r\nher remarks, she rose to go away, when I asked her name. Her countenance\r\nsuddenly clouded, and she said gravely, rather colouring, \xc3\xabMy name is\r\nHelen Walker; but your husband kens weel about me.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the evening I related how much I had been pleased, and inquired what\r\nwas extraordinary in the history of the poor woman. Mr. ---- said, there\r\nwere perhaps few more remarkable people than Helen Walker. She had been\r\nleft an orphan, with the charge of a sister considerably younger than\r\nherself, and who was educated and maintained by her exertions. Attached\r\nto herby so many ties, therefore, it will not be easy to conceive her\r\nfeelings, when she found that this only sister must be tried by the laws\r\nof her country for child-murder, and upon being called as principal\r\nwitness against her. The counsel for the prisoner told Helen, that if she\r\ncould declare that her sister had made any preparations, however slight,\r\nor had given her any intimation on the subject, that such a statement\r\nwould save her sister\xc3\xads life, as she was the principal witness against\r\nher. Helen said, \xc3\xabIt is impossible for me to swear to a falsehood; and,\r\nwhatever may be the consequence, I will give my oath according to my\r\nconscience.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trial came on, and the sister was found guilty and condemned; but in\r\nScotland six weeks must elapse between the sentence and the execution,\r\nand Helen Walker availed herself of it. The very day of her sister\xc3\xads\r\ncondemnation she got a petition drawn, stating the peculiar circumstances\r\nof the case, and that very night set out on foot to London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout introduction or recommendation, with her simple (perhaps\r\nill-expressed) petition, drawn up by some inferior clerk of the court,\r\nshe presented herself, in her tartan plaid and country attire, to the\r\nlate Duke of Argyle, who immediately procured the pardon she petitioned\r\nfor, and Helen returned with it on foot just in time to save her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so strongly interested by this narrative, that I determined\r\nimmediately to prosecute my acquaintance with Helen Walker; but as I was\r\nto leave the country next day, I was obliged to defer it till my return\r\nin spring, when the first walk I took was to Helen Walker\xc3\xads cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had died a short time before. My regret was extreme, and I\r\nendeavoured to obtain some account of Helen from an old woman who\r\ninhabited the other end of her cottage. I inquired if Helen ever spoke of\r\nher past history--her journey to London, etc., \xc3\xabNa,\xc3\xad the old woman said,\r\n\xc3\xabHelen was a wily body, and whene\xc3\xader ony o\xc3\xad the neebors asked anything\r\nabout it, she aye turned the conversation.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, every answer I received only tended to increase my regret, and\r\nraise my opinion of Helen Walker, who could unite so much prudence with\r\nso much heroic virtue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis narrative was inclosed in the following letter to the author,\r\nwithout date or signature--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,--The occurrence just related happened to me twenty-six years ago.\r\nHelen Walker lies buried in the churchyard of Irongray, about six miles\r\nfrom Dumfries. I once proposed that a small monument should have been\r\nerected to commemorate so remarkable a character, but I now prefer\r\nleaving it to you to perpetuate her memory in a more durable manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reader is now able to judge how far the author has improved upon, or\r\nfallen short of, the pleasing and interesting sketch of high principle\r\nand steady affection displayed by Helen Walker, the prototype of the\r\nfictitious Jeanie Deans. Mrs. Goldie was unfortunately dead before the\r\nauthor had given his name to these volumes, so he lost all opportunity of\r\nthanking that lady for her highly valuable communication. But her\r\ndaughter, Miss Goldie, obliged him with the following additional\r\ninformation:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Goldie endeavoured to collect further particulars of Helen Walker,\r\nparticularly concerning her journey to London, but found this nearly\r\nimpossible; as the natural dignity of her character, and a high sense of\r\nfamily respectability, made her so indissolubly connect her sister\xc3\xads\r\ndisgrace with her own exertions, that none of her neighbours durst ever\r\nquestion her upon the subject. One old woman, a distant relation of\r\nHelen\xc3\xads, and who is still living, says she worked an harvest with her,\r\nbut that she never ventured to ask her about her sister\xc3\xads trial, or her\r\njourney to London; \xc3\xabHelen,\xc3\xad she added, \xc3\xabwas a lofty body, and used a high\r\nstyle o\xc3\xad language.\xc3\xad The same old woman says, that every year Helen\r\nreceived a cheese from her sister, who lived at Whitehaven, and that she\r\nalways sent a liberal portion of it to herself, or to her father\xc3\xads\r\nfamily. This fact, though trivial in itself, strongly marks the affection\r\nsubsisting between the two sisters, and the complete conviction on the\r\nmind of the criminal that her sister had acted solely from high\r\nprinciple, not from any want of feeling, which another small but\r\ncharacteristic trait will further illustrate. A gentleman, a relation of\r\nMrs. Goldie\xc3\xads, who happened to be travelling in the North of England, on\r\ncoming to a small inn, was shown into the parlour by a female servant,\r\nwho, after cautiously shutting the door, said, \xc3\xabSir, I\xc3\xadm Nelly Walker\xc3\xads\r\nsister.\xc3\xad Thus practically showing that she considered her sister as\r\nbetter known by her high conduct than even herself by a different kind of\r\ncelebrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Goldie was extremely anxious to have a tombstone and an inscription\r\nupon it erected in Irongray Churchyard; and if Sir Walter Scott will\r\ncondescend to write the last, a little subscription could be easily\r\nraised in the immediate neighbourhood, and Mrs. Goldie\xc3\xads wish be thus\r\nfulfilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that the request of Miss Goldie will be\r\nmost willingly complied with, and without the necessity of any tax on the\r\npublic.* Nor is there much occasion to repeat how much the author\r\nconceives himself obliged to his unknown correspondent, who thus supplied\r\nhim with a theme affording such a pleasing view of the moral dignity of\r\nvirtue, though unaided by birth, beauty, or talent. If the picture has\r\nsuffered in the execution, it is from the failure of the author\xc3\xads powers\r\nto present in detail the same simple and striking portrait exhibited in\r\nMrs. Goldie\xc3\xads letter.\r\n\r\nAbbotsford, April 1, 1830.\r\n\r\n* [Note B. Tombstone to Helen Walker.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it would be impossible to add much to Mrs. Goldie\xc3\xads picturesque\r\nand most interesting account of Helen Walker, the prototype of the\r\nimaginary Jeanie Deans, the Editor may be pardoned for introducing two or\r\nthree anecdotes respecting that excellent person, which he has collected\r\nfrom a volume entitled, _Sketches from Nature,_ by John M\xc3\xadDiarmid, a\r\ngentleman who conducts an able provincial paper in the town of Dumfries.\r\n\r\nHelen was the daughter of a small farmer in a place called Dalwhairn, in\r\nthe parish of Irongray; where, after the death of her father, she\r\ncontinued, with the unassuming piety of a Scottish peasant, to support\r\nher mother by her own unremitted labour and privations; a case so common,\r\nthat even yet, I am proud to say, few of my countrywomen would shrink\r\nfrom the duty.\r\n\r\nHelen Walker was held among her equals _pensy,_ that is, proud or\r\nconceited; but the facts brought to prove this accusation seem only to\r\nevince a strength of character superior to those around her. Thus it was\r\nremarked, that when it thundered, she went with her work and her Bible to\r\nthe front of the cottage, alleging that the Almighty could smite in the\r\ncity as well as in the field.\r\n\r\nMr. M\xc3\xadDiarmid mentions more particularly the misfortune of her sister,\r\nwhich he supposes to have taken place previous to 1736. Helen Walker,\r\ndeclining every proposal of saving her relation\xc3\xads life at the expense of\r\ntruth, borrowed a sum of money sufficient for her journey, walked the\r\nwhole distance to London barefoot, and made her way to John Duke of\r\nArgyle. She was heard to say, that, by the Almighty strength, she had\r\nbeen enabled to meet the Duke at the most critical moment, which, if\r\nlost, would have caused the inevitable forfeiture of her sister\xc3\xads life.\r\n\r\nIsabella, or Tibby Walker, saved from the fate which impended over her,\r\nwas married by the person who had wronged her (named Waugh), and lived\r\nhappily for great part of a century, uniformly acknowledging the\r\nextraordinary affection to which she owed her preservation.\r\n\r\nHelen Walker died about the end of the year 1791, and her remains are\r\ninterred in the churchyard of her native parish of Irongray, in a\r\nromantic cemetery on the banks of the Cairn. That a character so\r\ndistinguished for her undaunted love of virtue, lived and died in\r\npoverty, if not want, serves only to show us how insignificant, in the\r\nsight of Heaven, are our principal objects of ambition upon earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n              So down thy hill, romantic Ashbourn, glides\r\n                The Derby dilly, carrying six insides.\r\n                                                            Frere.\r\n\r\nThe times have changed in nothing more (we follow as we were wont the\r\nmanuscript of Peter Pattieson) than in the rapid conveyance of\r\nintelligence and communication betwixt one part of Scotland and another.\r\nIt is not above twenty or thirty years, according to the evidence of many\r\ncredible witnesses now alive, since a little miserable horse-cart,\r\nperforming with difficulty a journey of thirty miles _per diem,_ carried\r\nour mails from the capital of Scotland to its extremity. Nor was Scotland\r\nmuch more deficient in these accommodations than our rich sister had been\r\nabout eighty years before. Fielding, in his Tom Jones, and Farquhar, in a\r\nlittle farce called the Stage-Coach, have ridiculed the slowness of these\r\nvehicles of public accommodation. According to the latter authority, the\r\nhighest bribe could only induce the coachman to promise to anticipate by\r\nhalf-an-hour the usual time of his arrival at the Bull and Mouth.\r\n\r\nBut in both countries these ancient, slow, and sure modes of conveyance\r\nare now alike unknown; mail-coach races against mail-coach, and\r\nhigh-flyer against high-flyer, through the most remote districts of\r\nBritain. And in our village alone, three post-coaches, and four coaches\r\nwith men armed, and in scarlet cassocks, thunder through the streets each\r\nday, and rival in brilliancy and noise the invention of the celebrated\r\ntyrant:--\r\n\r\n              Demens, qui nimbos et non imitabile fulmen,\r\n             AEre et cornipedum pulsu, simularat, equorum.\r\n\r\nNow and then, to complete the resemblance, and to correct the presumption\r\nof the venturous charioteers, it does happen that the career of these\r\ndashing rivals of Salmoneus meets with as undesirable and violent a\r\ntermination as that of their prototype. It is on such occasions that the\r\nInsides and Outsides, to use the appropriate vehicular phrases, have\r\nreason to rue the exchange of the slow and safe motion of the ancient\r\nFly-coaches, which, compared with the chariots of Mr. Palmer, so ill\r\ndeserve the name. The ancient vehicle used to settle quietly down, like a\r\nship scuttled and left to sink by the gradual influx of the waters, while\r\nthe modern is smashed to pieces with the velocity of the same vessel\r\nhurled against breakers, or rather with the fury of a bomb bursting at\r\nthe conclusion of its career through the air. The late ingenious Mr.\r\nPennant, whose humour it was to set his face in stern opposition to these\r\nspeedy conveyances, had collected, I have heard, a formidable list of\r\nsuch casualties, which, joined to the imposition of innkeepers, whose\r\ncharges the passengers had no time to dispute, the sauciness of the\r\ncoachman, and the uncontrolled and despotic authority of the tyrant\r\ncalled the guard, held forth a picture of horror, to which murder, theft,\r\nfraud, and peculation, lent all their dark colouring. But that which\r\ngratifies the impatience of the human disposition will be practised in\r\nthe teeth of danger, and in defiance of admonition; and, in despite of\r\nthe Cambrian antiquary, mail-coaches not only roll their thunders round\r\nthe base of Penman-Maur and Cader-Idris, but\r\n\r\n                      Frighted Skiddaw hears afar\r\n                      The rattling of the unscythed car.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps the echoes of Ben Nevis may soon be awakened by the bugle,\r\nnot of a warlike chieftain, but of the guard of a mail-coach.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine summer day, and our little school had obtained a\r\nhalf-holiday, by the intercession of a good-humoured visitor.*\r\n\r\n* His honour Gilbert Goslinn of Gandercleugh; for I love to be precise in\r\nmatters of importance.--J. C.\r\n\r\nI expected by the coach a new number of an interesting periodical\r\npublication, and walked forward on the highway to meet it, with the\r\nimpatience which Cowper has described as actuating the resident in the\r\ncountry when longing for intelligence from the mart of news.--\r\n\r\n                                      The grand debate,\r\n                    The popular harangue,--the tart reply,--\r\n                    The logic, and the wisdom, and the wit,\r\n                    And the loud laugh,--I long to know them all;--\r\n                    I burn to set the imprisoned wranglers free,\r\n                    And give them voice and utterance again.\r\n\r\nIt was with such feelings that I eyed the approach of the new coach,\r\nlately established on our road, and known by the name of the Somerset,\r\nwhich, to say truth, possesses some interest for me, even when it conveys\r\nno such important information. The distant tremulous sound of its wheels\r\nwas heard just as I gained the summit of the gentle ascent, called the\r\nGoslin-brae, from which you command an extensive view down the valley of\r\nthe river Gander. The public road, which comes up the side of that\r\nstream, and crosses it at a bridge about a quarter of a mile from the\r\nplace where I was standing, runs partly through enclosures and\r\nplantations, and partly through open pasture land. It is a childish\r\namusement perhaps,--but my life has been spent with children, and why\r\nshould not my pleasures be like theirs?--childish as it is then, I must\r\nown I have had great pleasure in watching the approach of the carriage,\r\nwhere the openings of the road permit it to be seen. The gay glancing of\r\nthe equipage, its diminished and toy-like appearance at a distance,\r\ncontrasted with the rapidity of its motion, its appearance and\r\ndisappearance at intervals, and the progressively increasing sounds that\r\nannounce its nearer approach, have all to the idle and listless\r\nspectator, who has nothing more important to attend to, something of\r\nawakening interest. The ridicule may attach to me, which is flung upon\r\nmany an honest citizen, who watches from the window of his villa the\r\npassage of the stage-coach; but it is a very natural source of amusement\r\nnotwithstanding, and many of those who join in the laugh are perhaps not\r\nunused to resort to it in secret.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, however, fate had decreed that I should not\r\nenjoy the consummation of the amusement by seeing the coach rattle past\r\nme as I sat on the turf, and hearing the hoarse grating voice of the\r\nguard as he skimmed forth for my grasp the expected packet, without the\r\ncarriage checking its course for an instant. I had seen the vehicle\r\nthunder down the hill that leads to the bridge with more than its usual\r\nimpetuosity, glittering all the while by flashes from a cloudy tabernacle\r\nof the dust which it had raised, and leaving a train behind it on the\r\nroad resembling a wreath of summer mist. But it did not appear on the top\r\nof the nearer bank within the usual space of three minutes, which\r\nfrequent observation had enabled me to ascertain was the medium time for\r\ncrossing the bridge and mounting the ascent. When double that space had\r\nelapsed, I became alarmed, and walked hastily forward. As I came in sight\r\nof the bridge, the cause of delay was too manifest, for the Somerset had\r\nmade a summerset in good earnest, and overturned so completely, that it\r\nwas literally resting upon the ground, with the roof undermost, and the\r\nfour wheels in the air. The \xe2\x80\x9cexertions of the guard and coachman,\xe2\x80\x9d both\r\nof whom were gratefully commemorated in the newspapers, having succeeded\r\nin disentangling the horses by cutting the harness, were now proceeding\r\nto extricate the insides by a sort of summary and Caesarean process of\r\ndelivery, forcing the hinges from one of the doors which they could not\r\nopen otherwise. In this manner were two disconsolate damsels set at\r\nliberty from the womb of the leathern conveniency. As they immediately\r\nbegan to settle their clothes, which were a little deranged, as may be\r\npresumed, I concluded they had received no injury, and did not venture to\r\nobtrude my services at their toilette, for which, I understand, I have\r\nsince been reflected upon by the fair sufferers. The _outsides,_ who must\r\nhave been discharged from their elevated situation by a shock resembling\r\nthe springing of a mine, escaped, nevertheless, with the usual allowance\r\nof scratches and bruises, excepting three, who, having been pitched into\r\nthe river Gander, were dimly seen contending with the tide like the\r\nrelics of AEneas\xc3\xads shipwreck,--\r\n\r\n                  Rari apparent mantes in gurgite vasto.\r\n\r\nI applied my poor exertions where they seemed to be most needed, and with\r\nthe assistance of one or two of the company who had escaped unhurt,\r\neasily succeeded in fishing out two of the unfortunate passengers, who\r\nwere stout active young fellows; and, but for the preposterous length of\r\ntheir greatcoats, and the equally fashionable latitude and longitude of\r\ntheir Wellington trousers, would have required little assistance from any\r\none. The third was sickly and elderly, and might have perished but for\r\nthe efforts used to preserve him.\r\n\r\nWhen the two greatcoated gentlemen had extricated themselves from the\r\nriver, and shaken their ears like huge water-dogs, a violent altercation\r\nensued betwixt them and the coachman and guard, concerning the cause of\r\ntheir overthrow. In the course of the squabble, I observed that both my\r\nnew acquaintances belonged to the law, and that their professional\r\nsharpness was likely to prove an overmatch for the surly and official\r\ntone of the guardians of the vehicle. The dispute ended in the guard\r\nassuring the passengers that they should have seats in a heavy coach\r\nwhich would pass that spot in less than half-an-hour, provided it were\r\nnot full. Chance seemed to favour this arrangement, for when the expected\r\nvehicle, arrived, there were only two places occupied in a carriage which\r\nprofessed to carry six. The two ladies who had been disinterred out of\r\nthe fallen vehicle were readily admitted, but positive objections were\r\nstated by those previously in possession to the admittance of the two\r\nlawyers, whose wetted garments being much of the nature of well-soaked\r\nsponges, there was every reason to believe they would refund a\r\nconsiderable part of the water they had collected, to the inconvenience\r\nof their fellow-passengers. On the other hand, the lawyers rejected a\r\nseat on the roof, alleging that they had only taken that station for\r\npleasure for one stage, but were entitled in all respects to free egress\r\nand regress from the interior, to which their contract positively\r\nreferred. After some altercation, in which something was said upon the\r\nedict _Nautae caupones stabularii,_ the coach went off, leaving the\r\nlearned gentlemen to abide by their action of damages.\r\n\r\nThey immediately applied to me to guide them to the next village and the\r\nbest inn; and from the account I gave them of the Wallace Head, declared\r\nthey were much better pleased to stop there than to go forward upon the\r\nterms of that impudent scoundrel the guard of the Somerset. All that they\r\nnow wanted was a lad to carry their travelling bags, who was easily\r\nprocured from an adjoining cottage; and they prepared to walk forward,\r\nwhen they found there was another passenger in the same deserted\r\nsituation with themselves. This was the elderly and sickly-looking\r\nperson, who had been precipitated into the river along with the two young\r\nlawyers. He, it seems, had been too modest to push his own plea against\r\nthe coachman when he saw that of his betters rejected, and now remained\r\nbehind with a look of timid anxiety, plainly intimating that he was\r\ndeficient in those means of recommendation which are necessary passports\r\nto the hospitality of an inn.\r\n\r\nI ventured to call the attention of the two dashing young blades, for\r\nsuch they seemed, to the desolate condition of their fellow-traveller.\r\nThey took the hint with ready good-nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, true, Mr. Dunover,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the youngsters, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not remain\r\non the pave\xc3\xad here; you must go and have some dinner with us--Halkit and I\r\nmust have a post-chaise to go on, at all events, and we will set you down\r\nwherever suits you best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor man, for such his dress, as well as his diffidence, bespoke him,\r\nmade the sort of acknowledging bow by which says a Scotsman, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads too\r\nmuch honour for the like of me;\xe2\x80\x9d and followed humbly behind his gay\r\npatrons, all three besprinkling the dusty road as they walked along with\r\nthe moisture of their drenched garments, and exhibiting the singular and\r\nsomewhat ridiculous appearance of three persons suffering from the\r\nopposite extreme of humidity, while the summer sun was at its height, and\r\neverything else around them had the expression of heat and drought. The\r\nridicule did not escape the young gentlemen themselves, and they had made\r\nwhat might be received as one or two tolerable jests on the subject\r\nbefore they had advanced far on their peregrination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot complain, like Cowley,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Gideon\xc3\xads\r\nfleece remains dry, while all around is moist; this is the reverse of the\r\nmiracle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to be received with gratitude in this good town; we bring a\r\nsupply of what they seem to need most,\xe2\x80\x9d said Halkit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd distribute it with unparalleled generosity,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his companion;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cperforming the part of three water-carts for the benefit of their dusty\r\nroads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe come before them, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Halkit, \xe2\x80\x9cin full professional\r\nforce--counsel and agent\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd client,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young advocate, looking behind him; and then\r\nadded, lowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat looks as if he had kept such dangerous\r\ncompany too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, too true, that the humble follower of the gay young men\r\nhad the threadbare appearance of a worn-out litigant, and I could not but\r\nsmile at the conceit, though anxious to conceal my mirth from the object\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the Wallace Inn, the elder of the Edinburgh gentlemen,\r\nand whom I understood to be a barrister, insisted that I should remain\r\nand take part of their dinner; and their inquiries and demands speedily\r\nput my landlord and his whole family in motion to produce the best cheer\r\nwhich the larder and cellar afforded, and proceed to cook it to the best\r\nadvantage, a science in which our entertainers seemed to be admirably\r\nskilled. In other respects they were lively young men, in the hey-day of\r\nyouth and good spirits, playing the part which is common to the higher\r\nclasses of the law at Edinburgh, and which nearly resembles that of the\r\nyoung Templars in the days of Steele and Addison. An air of giddy gaiety\r\nmingled with the good sense, taste, and information which their\r\nconversation exhibited; and it seemed to be their object to unite the\r\ncharacter of men of fashion and lovers of the polite arts. A fine\r\ngentleman, bred up in the thorough idleness and inanity of pursuit, which\r\nI understand is absolutely necessary to the character in perfection,\r\nmight in all probability have traced a tinge of professional pedantry\r\nwhich marked the barrister in spite of his efforts, and something of\r\nactive bustle in his companion, and would certainly have detected more\r\nthan a fashionable mixture of information and animated interest in the\r\nlanguage of both. But to me, who had no pretensions to be so critical, my\r\ncompanions seemed to form a very happy mixture of good-breeding and\r\nliberal information, with a disposition to lively rattle, pun, and jest,\r\namusing to a grave man, because it is what he himself can least easily\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe thin pale-faced man, whom their good-nature had brought into their\r\nsociety, looked out of place as well as out of spirits; sate on the edge\r\nof his seat, and kept the chair at two feet distance from the table; thus\r\nincommoding himself considerably in conveying the victuals to his mouth,\r\nas if by way of penance for partaking of them in the company of his\r\nsuperiors. A short time after dinner, declining all entreaty to partake\r\nof the wine, which circulated freely round, he informed himself of the\r\nhour when the chaise had been ordered to attend; and saying he would be\r\nin readiness, modestly withdrew from the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJack,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barrister to his companion, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember that poor\r\nfellow\xc3\xads face; you spoke more truly than you were aware of; he really is\r\none of my clients, poor man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor man!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Halkit--\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you mean he is your one and only\r\nclient?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads not my fault, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, whose name I discovered\r\nwas Hardie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to give me all your business, you know; and if you\r\nhave none, the learned gentleman here knows nothing can come of nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to have brought something to nothing though, in the case of\r\nthat honest man. He looks as if he were just about to honour with his\r\nresidence the Heart of Mid-Lothian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken--he is just delivered from it.--Our friend here looks\r\nfor an explanation. Pray, Mr. Pattieson, have you been in Edinburgh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must have passed, occasionally at least, though probably not so\r\nfaithfully as I am doomed to do, through a narrow intricate passage,\r\nleading out of the north-west corner of the Parliament Square, and\r\npassing by a high and antique building with turrets and iron grates,\r\n\r\n                         Making good the saying odd,\r\n                         \xc3\xabNear the church and far from God\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nMr. Halkit broke in upon his learned counsel, to contribute his moiety to\r\nthe riddle--\xe2\x80\x9cHaving at the door the sign of the Red man\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd being on the whole,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the counsellor interrupting his friend\r\nin his turn, \xe2\x80\x9ca sort of place where misfortune is happily confounded with\r\nguilt, where all who are in wish to get out\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where none who have the good luck to be out, wish to get in,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI conceive you, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I; \xe2\x80\x9cyou mean the prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prison,\xe2\x80\x9d added the young lawyer--\xe2\x80\x9cYou have hit it--the very reverend\r\nTolbooth itself; and let me tell you, you are obliged to us for\r\ndescribing it with so much modesty and brevity; for with whatever\r\namplifications we might have chosen to decorate the subject, you lay\r\nentirely at our mercy, since the Fathers Conscript of our city have\r\ndecreed that the venerable edifice itself shall not remain in existence\r\nto confirm or to confute its.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the Tolbooth of Edinburgh is called the Heart of Mid-Lothian?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo termed and reputed, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with the bashful diffidence with which a man lets slip\r\na pun in presence of his superiors, \xe2\x80\x9cthe metropolitan county may, in that\r\ncase, be said to have a sad heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight as my glove, Mr. Pattieson,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Hardie; \xe2\x80\x9cand a close heart,\r\nand a hard heart--Keep it up, Jack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a wicked heart, and a poor heart,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Halkit, doing his best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet it may be called in some sort a strong heart, and a high heart,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n rejoined the advocate. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I can put you both out of heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have played all my hearts,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xc3\xadll have another lead,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his companion.--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as to the\r\nold and condemned Tolbooth, what pity the same honour cannot be done to\r\nit as has been done to many of its inmates. Why should not the Tolbooth\r\nhave its \xc3\xabLast Speech, Confession, and Dying Words?\xc3\xad The old stones would\r\nbe just as conscious of the honour as many a poor devil who has dangled\r\nlike a tassel at the west end of it, while the hawkers were shouting a\r\nconfession the culprit had never heard of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif I might presume to give my opinion, it would\r\nbe a tale of unvaried sorrow and guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot entirely, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hardie; \xe2\x80\x9ca prison is a world within\r\nitself, and has its own business, griefs, and joys, peculiar to its\r\ncircle. Its inmates are sometimes short-lived, but so are soldiers on\r\nservice; they are poor relatively to the world without, but there are\r\ndegrees of wealth and poverty among them, and so some are relatively rich\r\nalso. They cannot stir abroad, but neither can the garrison of a besieged\r\nfort, or the crew of a ship at sea; and they are not under a dispensation\r\nquite so desperate as either, for they may have as much food as they have\r\nmoney to buy, and are not obliged to work, whether they have food or\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what variety of incident,\xe2\x80\x9d said I (not without a secret view to my\r\npresent task), \xe2\x80\x9ccould possibly be derived from such a work as you are\r\npleased to talk of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInfinite,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young advocate. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever of guilt, crime,\r\nimposture, folly, unheard-of misfortunes, and unlooked-for change of\r\nfortune, can be found to chequer life, my Last Speech of the Tolbooth\r\nshould illustrate with examples sufficient to gorge even the public\xc3\xads\r\nall-devouring appetite for the wonderful and horrible. The inventor of\r\nfictitious narratives has to rack his brains for means to diversify his\r\ntale, and after all can hardly hit upon characters or incidents which\r\nhave not been used again and again, until they are familiar to the eye of\r\nthe reader, so that the development, _enle\xc3\xadvement,_ the desperate wound\r\nof which the hero never dies, the burning fever from which the heroine is\r\nsure to recover, become a mere matter of course. I join with my honest\r\nfriend Crabbe, and have an unlucky propensity to hope, when hope is lost,\r\nand to rely upon the cork-jacket, which carries the heroes of romance\r\nsafe through all the billows of affliction.\xe2\x80\x9d He then declaimed the\r\nfollowing passage, rather with too much than too little emphasis:--\r\n\r\n\r\n               Much have I feared, but am no more afraid,\r\n               When some chaste beauty by some wretch betrayed,\r\n               Is drawn away with such distracted speed,\r\n               That she anticipates a dreadful deed.\r\n               Not so do I--Let solid walls impound\r\n               The captive fair, and dig a moat around;\r\n               Let there be brazen locks and bars of steel,\r\n               And keepers cruel, such as never feel;\r\n               With not a single note the purse supply,\r\n               And when she begs, let men and maids deny;\r\n               Be windows there from which she dare not fall,\r\n               And help so distant, \xc3\xabtis in vain to call;\r\n               Still means of freedom will some Power devise,\r\n               And from the baffled ruffian snatch his prize.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe end of uncertainty,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cis the death of interest; and\r\nhence it happens that no one now reads novels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear him, ye gods!\xe2\x80\x9d returned his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you, Mr.\r\nPattieson, you will hardly visit this learned gentleman, but you are\r\nlikely to find the new novel most in repute lying on his table,--snugly\r\nintrenched, however, beneath Stair\xc3\xads Institutes, or an open volume of\r\nMorrison\xc3\xads Decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I deny it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the hopeful jurisconsult, \xe2\x80\x9cor wherefore should I,\r\nsince it is well known these Delilahs seduce my wisers and my betters?\r\nMay they not be found lurking amidst the multiplied memorials of our most\r\ndistinguished counsel, and even peeping from under the cushion of a\r\njudge\xc3\xads arm-chair? Our seniors at the bar, within the bar, and even on\r\nthe bench, read novels; and, if not belied, some of them have written\r\nnovels into the bargain. I only say, that I read from habit and from\r\nindolence, not from real interest; that, like ancient Pistol devouring\r\nhis leek, I read and swear till I get to the end of the narrative. But\r\nnot so in the real records of human vagaries--not so in the State Trials,\r\nor in the Books of Adjournal, where every now and then you read new pages\r\nof the human heart, and turns of fortune far beyond what the boldest\r\nnovelist ever attempted to produce from the coinage of his brain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for such narratives,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cyou suppose the History of the\r\nPrison of Edinburgh might afford appropriate materials?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a degree unusually ample, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hardie--\xe2\x80\x9cFill your\r\nglass, however, in the meanwhile. Was it not for many years the place in\r\nwhich the Scottish parliament met? Was it not James\xc3\xads place of refuge,\r\nwhen the mob, inflamed by a seditious preacher, broke, forth, on him with\r\nthe cries of \xc3\xabThe sword of the Lord and of Gideon--bring forth the wicked\r\nHaman?\xc3\xad Since that time how many hearts have throbbed within these walls,\r\nas the tolling of the neighbouring bell announced to them how fast the\r\nsands of their life were ebbing; how many must have sunk at the\r\nsound--how many were supported by stubborn pride and dogged\r\nresolution--how many by the consolations of religion? Have there not\r\nbeen some, who, looking back on the motives of their crimes, were scarce\r\nable to understand how they should have had such temptation as to seduce\r\nthem from virtue; and have there not, perhaps, been others, who,\r\nsensible of their innocence, were divided between indignation at the\r\nundeserved doom which they were to undergo, consciousness that they had\r\nnot deserved it, and racking anxiety to discover some way in which they\r\nmight yet vindicate themselves? Do you suppose any of these deep,\r\npowerful, and agitating feelings, can be recorded and perused without\r\nexciting a corresponding depth of deep, powerful, and agitating\r\ninterest?--Oh! do but wait till I publish the _Causes Ce\xc3\xadle\xc3\xadbres_ of\r\nCaledonia, and you will find no want of a novel or a tragedy for some\r\ntime to come. The true thing will triumph over the brightest inventions\r\nof the most ardent imagination. _Magna est veritas, et praevalebit._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have understood,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, encouraged by the affability of my rattling\r\nentertainer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat less of this interest must attach to Scottish\r\njurisprudence than to that of any other country. The general morality of\r\nour people, their sober and prudent habits\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecure them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barrister, \xe2\x80\x9cagainst any great increase of\r\nprofessional thieves and depredators, but not against wild and wayward\r\nstarts of fancy and passion, producing crimes of an extraordinary\r\ndescription, which are precisely those to the detail of which we listen\r\nwith thrilling interest. England has been much longer a highly civilised\r\ncountry; her subjects have been very strictly amenable to laws\r\nadministered without fear or favour, a complete division of labour has\r\ntaken place among her subjects, and the very thieves and robbers form a\r\ndistinct class in society, subdivided among themselves according to the\r\nsubject of the depredations, and the mode in which they carry them on,\r\nacting upon regular habits and principles, which can be calculated and\r\nanticipated at Bow Street, Hatton Garden, or the Old Bailey. Our sister\r\nkingdom is like a cultivated field,--the farmer expects that, in spite of\r\nall his care, a certain number of weeds will rise with the corn, and can\r\ntell you beforehand their names and appearance. But Scotland is like one\r\nof her own Highland glens, and the moralist who reads the records of her\r\ncriminal jurisprudence, will find as many curious anomalous facts in the\r\nhistory of mind, as the botanist will detect rare specimens among her\r\ndingles and cliffs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xc3\xads all the good you have obtained from three perusals of the\r\nCommentaries on Scottish Criminal Jurisprudence?\xe2\x80\x9d said his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose the learned author very little thinks that the facts which his\r\nerudition and acuteness have accumulated for the illustration of legal\r\ndoctrines, might be so arranged as to form a sort of appendix to the\r\nhalf-bound and slip-shod volumes of the circulating library.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll bet you a pint of claret,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he will not\r\nfeel sore at the comparison. But as we say at the bar, \xc3\xabI beg I may not\r\nbe interrupted;\xc3\xad I have much more to say, upon my Scottish collection of\r\n_Causes Ce\xc3\xadle\xc3\xadbres._ You will please recollect the scope and motive given\r\nfor the contrivance and execution of many extraordinary and daring\r\ncrimes, by the long civil dissensions of Scotland--by the hereditary\r\njurisdictions, which, until 1748, rested the investigation of crises in\r\njudges, ignorant, partial, or interested--by the habits of the gentry,\r\nshut up in their distant and solitary mansion-houses, nursing their\r\nrevengeful Passions just to keep their blood from stagnating--not to\r\nmention that amiable national qualification, called the _perfervidum\r\ningenium Scotorum,_ which our lawyers join in alleging as a reason for\r\nthe severity of some of our enactments. When I come to treat of matters\r\nso mysterious, deep, and dangerous, as these circumstances have given\r\nrise to, the blood of each reader shall be curdled, and his epidermis\r\ncrisped into goose skin.--But, hist!--here comes the landlord, with\r\ntidings, I suppose, that the chaise is ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was no such thing--the tidings bore, that no chaise could be had that\r\nevening, for Sir Peter Plyem had carried forward my landlord\xc3\xads two pairs\r\nof horses that morning to the ancient royal borough of Bubbleburgh, to\r\nlook after his interest there. But as Bubbleburgh is only one of a set of\r\nfive boroughs which club their shares for a member of parliament, Sir\r\nPeter\xc3\xads adversary had judiciously watched his departure, in order to\r\ncommence a canvass in the no less royal borough of Bitem, which, as all\r\nthe world knows, lies at the very termination of Sir Peter\xc3\xads avenue, and\r\nhas been held in leading-strings by him and his ancestors for time\r\nimmemorial. Now Sir Peter was thus placed in the situation of an\r\nambitious monarch, who, after having commenced a daring inroad into his\r\nenemy\xc3\xads territories, is suddenly recalled by an invasion of his own\r\nhereditary dominions. He was obliged in consequence to return from the\r\nhalf-won borough of Bubbleburgh, to look after the half-lost borough of\r\nBitem, and the two pairs of horses which had carried him that morning to\r\nBubbleburgh were now forcibly detained to transport him, his agent, his\r\nvalet, his jester, and his hard-drinker, across the country to Bitem. The\r\ncause of this detention, which to me was of as little consequence as it\r\nmay be to the reader, was important enough to my companions to reconcile\r\nthem to the delay. Like eagles, they smelled the battle afar off, ordered\r\na magnum of claret and beds at the Wallace, and entered at full career\r\ninto the Bubbleburgh and Bitem politics, with all the probable \xe2\x80\x9cPetitions\r\nand complaints\xe2\x80\x9d to which they were likely to give rise.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of an anxious, animated, and, to me, most unintelligible\r\ndiscussion, concerning provosts, bailies, deacons, sets of boroughs,\r\nleets, town-clerks, burgesses resident and non-resident, all of a sudden\r\nthe lawyer recollected himself. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Dunover, we must not forget him;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and the landlord was despatched in quest of the _pauvre honteux,_ with an\r\nearnestly civil invitation to him for the rest of the evening. I could\r\nnot help asking the young gentlemen if they knew the history of this poor\r\nman; and the counsellor applied himself to his pocket to recover the\r\nmemorial or brief from which he had stated his cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been a candidate for our _remedium miserabile,_\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hardie,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccommonly called a _cessio bonorum._ As there are divines who have\r\ndoubted the eternity of future punishments, so the Scotch lawyers seem to\r\nhave thought that the crime of poverty might be atoned for by something\r\nshort of perpetual imprisonment. After a month\xc3\xads confinement, you must\r\nknow, a prisoner for debt is entitled, on a sufficient statement to our\r\nSupreme Court, setting forth the amount of his funds, and the nature of\r\nhis misfortunes, and surrendering all his effects to his creditors, to\r\nclaim to be discharged from prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had heard,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cof such a humane regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Halkit, \xe2\x80\x9cand the beauty of it is, as the foreign fellow said,\r\nyou may get the _cessio,_ when the _bonorums_ are all spent--But what,\r\nare you puzzling in your pockets to seek your only memorial among old\r\nplay-bills, letters requesting a meeting of the Faculty, rules of the\r\nSpeculative Society,* syllabus\xc3\xad of lectures--all the miscellaneous\r\ncontents of a young advocate\xc3\xads pocket, which contains everything but\r\nbriefs and bank-notes?\r\n\r\n* [A well-known debating club in Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nCan you not state a case of _cessio_ without your memorial? Why, it is\r\ndone every Saturday. The events follow each other as regularly as\r\nclock-work, and one form of condescendence might suit every one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very unlike the variety of distress which this gentleman stated\r\nto fall under the consideration of your judges,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Halkit; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Hardie spoke of criminal jurisprudence, and\r\nthis business is purely civil. I could plead a _cessio_ myself without\r\nthe inspiring honours of a gown and three-tailed periwig--Listen.--My\r\nclient was bred a journeyman weaver--made some little money--took a\r\nfarm--(for conducting a farm, like driving a gig, comes by nature)--late\r\nsevere times--induced to sign bills with a friend, for which he received\r\nno value--landlord sequestrates--creditors accept a composition--pursuer\r\nsets up a public-house--fails a second time--is incarcerated for a debt\r\nof ten pounds seven shillings and sixpence--his debts amount to\r\nblank--his losses to blank--his funds to blank--leaving a balance of blank\r\nin his favour. There is no opposition; your lordships will please grant\r\ncommission to take his oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHardie now renounced this ineffectual search, in which there was perhaps\r\na little affectation, and told us the tale of poor Dunover\xc3\xads distresses,\r\nwith a tone in which a degree of feeling, which he seemed ashamed of as\r\nunprofessional, mingled with his attempts at wit, and did him more\r\nhonour. It was one of those tales which seem to argue a sort of ill-luck\r\nor fatality attached to the hero. A well-informed, industrious, and\r\nblameless, but poor and bashful man, had in vain essayed all the usual\r\nmeans by which others acquire independence, yet had never succeeded\r\nbeyond the attainment of bare subsistence. During a brief gleam of hope,\r\nrather than of actual prosperity, he had added a wife and family to his\r\ncares, but the dawn was speedily overcast. Everything retrograded with\r\nhim towards the verge of the miry Slough of Despond, which yawns for\r\ninsolvent debtors; and after catching at each twig, and experiencing the\r\nprotracted agony of feeling them one by one elude his grasp, he actually\r\nsunk into the miry pit whence he had been extricated by the professional\r\nexertions of Hardie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, I suppose, now you have dragged this poor devil ashore, you will\r\nleave him half naked on the beach to provide for himself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Halkit.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark ye,\xe2\x80\x9d--and he whispered something in his ear, of which the\r\npenetrating and insinuating words, \xe2\x80\x9cInterest with my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d alone reached\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is _pessimi exempli,_\xe2\x80\x9d said Hardie, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cto provide for a\r\nruined client; but I was thinking of what you mention, provided it can be\r\nmanaged--But hush! here he comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe recent relation of the poor man\xc3\xads misfortunes had given him, I was\r\npleased to observe, a claim to the attention and respect of the young\r\nmen, who treated him with great civility, and gradually engaged him in a\r\nconversation, which, much to my satisfaction, again turned upon the\r\n_Causes Ce\xc3\xadle\xc3\xadbres_ of Scotland. Imboldened by the kindness with which he\r\nwas treated, Mr. Dunover began to contribute his share to the amusement\r\nof the evening. Jails, like other places, have their ancient traditions,\r\nknown only to the inhabitants, and handed down from one set of the\r\nmelancholy lodgers to the next who occupy their cells. Some of these,\r\nwhich Dunover mentioned, were interesting, and served to illustrate the\r\nnarratives of remarkable trials, which Hardie had at his finger-ends, and\r\nwhich his companion was also well skilled in. This sort of conversation\r\npassed away the evening till the early hour when Mr. Dunover chose to\r\nretire to rest, and I also retreated to take down memorandums of what I\r\nhad learned, in order to add another narrative to those which it had been\r\nmy chief amusement to collect, and to write out in detail. The two young\r\nmen ordered a broiled bone, Madeira negus, and a pack of cards, and\r\ncommenced a game at picquet.\r\n\r\nNext morning the travellers left Gandercleugh. I afterwards learned from\r\nthe papers that both have been since engaged in the great political cause\r\nof Bubbleburgh and Bitem, a summary case, and entitled to particular\r\ndespatch; but which, it is thought, nevertheless, may outlast the\r\nduration of the parliament to which the contest refers. Mr. Halkit, as\r\nthe newspapers informed me, acts as agent or solicitor; and Mr. Hardie\r\nopened for Sir Peter Plyem with singular ability, and to such good\r\npurpose, that I understand he has since had fewer play-bills and more\r\nbriefs in his pocket. And both the young gentlemen deserve their good\r\nfortune; for I learned from Dunover, who called on me some weeks\r\nafterwards, and communicated the intelligence with tears in his eyes,\r\nthat their interest had availed to obtain him a small office for the\r\ndecent maintenance of his family; and that, after a train of constant and\r\nuninterrupted misfortune, he could trace a dawn of prosperity to his\r\nhaving the good fortune to be flung from the top of a mail-coach into the\r\nriver Gander, in company with an advocate and a writer to the Signet. The\r\nreader will not perhaps deem himself equally obliged to the accident,\r\nsince it brings upon him the following narrative, founded upon the\r\nconversation of the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEART OF MIDLOTHIAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Whoe\xc3\xader\xc3\xads been at Paris must needs know the Gre\xc3\xadve,\r\n               The fatal retreat of the unfortunate brave,\r\n               Where honour and justice most oddly contribute,\r\n               To ease heroes\xc3\xad pains by an halter and gibbet.\r\n\r\n               There death breaks the shackles which force had put on,\r\n               And the hangman completes what the judge but began;\r\n               There the squire of the poet, and knight of the post,\r\n               Find their pains no more baulked, and their hopes no more\r\n               crossed.\r\n                                                Prior.\r\n\r\nIn former times, England had her Tyburn, to which the devoted victims of\r\njustice were conducted in solemn procession up what is now called Oxford\r\nStreet. In Edinburgh, a large open street, or rather oblong square,\r\nsurrounded by high houses, called the Grassmarket, was used for the same\r\nmelancholy purpose. It was not ill chosen for such a scene, being of\r\nconsiderable extent, and therefore fit to accommodate a great number of\r\nspectators, such as are usually assembled by this melancholy spectacle.\r\nOn the other hand, few of the houses which surround it were, even in\r\nearly times, inhabited by persons of fashion; so that those likely to be\r\noffended or over deeply affected by such unpleasant exhibitions were not\r\nin the way of having their quiet disturbed by them. The houses in the\r\nGrassmarket are, generally speaking, of a mean description; yet the place\r\nis not without some features of grandeur, being overhung by the southern\r\nside of the huge rock on which the Castle stands, and by the moss-grown\r\nbattlements and turreted walls of that ancient fortress.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom, until within these thirty years or thereabouts, to use\r\nthis esplanade for the scene of public executions. The fatal day was\r\nannounced to the public by the appearance of a huge black gallows-tree\r\ntowards the eastern end of the Grassmarket. This ill-omened apparition\r\nwas of great height, with a scaffold surrounding it, and a double ladder\r\nplaced against it, for the ascent of the unhappy criminal and\r\nexecutioner. As this apparatus was always arranged before dawn, it seemed\r\nas if the gallows had grown out of the earth in the course of one night,\r\nlike the production of some foul demon; and I well remember the fright\r\nwith which the schoolboys, when I was one of their number, used to regard\r\nthese ominous signs of deadly preparation. On the night after the\r\nexecution the gallows again disappeared, and was conveyed in silence and\r\ndarkness to the place where it was usually deposited, which was one of\r\nthe vaults under the Parliament House, or courts of justice. This mode of\r\nexecution is now exchanged for one similar to that in front of\r\nNewgate,--with what beneficial effect is uncertain. The mental\r\nsufferings of the convict are indeed shortened. He no longer stalks\r\nbetween the attendant clergymen, dressed in his grave-clothes, through a\r\nconsiderable part of the city, looking like a moving and walking corpse,\r\nwhile yet an inhabitant of this world; but, as the ultimate purpose of\r\npunishment has in view the prevention of crimes, it may at least be\r\ndoubted, whether, in abridging the melancholy ceremony, we have not in\r\npart diminished that appalling effect upon the spectators which is the\r\nuseful end of all such inflictions, and in consideration of which alone,\r\nunless in very particular cases, capital sentences can be altogether\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of September 1736, these ominous preparations for\r\nexecution were descried in the place we have described, and at an early\r\nhour the space around began to be occupied by several groups, who gazed\r\non the scaffold and gibbet with a stern and vindictive show of\r\nsatisfaction very seldom testified by the populace, whose good nature, in\r\nmost cases, forgets the crime of the condemned person, and dwells only on\r\nhis misery. But the act of which the expected culprit had been convicted\r\nwas of a description calculated nearly and closely to awaken and irritate\r\nthe resentful feelings of the multitude. The tale is well known; yet it\r\nis necessary to recapitulate its leading circumstances, for the better\r\nunderstanding what is to follow; and the narrative may prove long, but I\r\ntrust not uninteresting even to those who have heard its general issue.\r\nAt any rate, some detail is necessary, in order to render intelligible\r\nthe subsequent events of our narrative.\r\n\r\nContraband trade, though it strikes at the root of legitimate government,\r\nby encroaching on its revenues,--though it injures the fair trader, and\r\ndebauches the mind of those engaged in it,--is not usually looked upon,\r\neither by the vulgar or by their betters, in a very heinous point of\r\nview. On the contrary, in those countries where it prevails, the\r\ncleverest, boldest, and most intelligent of the peasantry, are uniformly\r\nengaged in illicit transactions, and very often with the sanction of the\r\nfarmers and inferior gentry. Smuggling was almost universal in Scotland\r\nin the reigns of George I. and II.; for the people, unaccustomed to\r\nimposts, and regarding them as an unjust aggression upon their ancient\r\nliberties, made no scruple to elude them whenever it was possible to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThe county of Fife, bounded by two firths on the south and north, and by\r\nthe sea on the east, and having a number of small seaports, was long\r\nfamed for maintaining successfully a contraband trade; and, as there were\r\nmany seafaring men residing there, who had been pirates and buccaneers in\r\ntheir youth, there were not wanting a sufficient number of daring men to\r\ncarry it on. Among these, a fellow called Andrew Wilson, originally a\r\nbaker in the village of Pathhead, was particularly obnoxious to the\r\nrevenue officers. He was possessed of great personal strength, courage,\r\nand cunning,--was perfectly acquainted with the coast, and capable of\r\nconducting the most desperate enterprises. On several occasions he\r\nsucceeded in baffling the pursuit and researches of the king\xc3\xads officers;\r\nbut he became so much the object of their suspicions and watchful\r\nattention, that at length he was totally ruined by repeated seizures. The\r\nman became desperate. He considered himself as robbed and plundered; and\r\ntook it into his head that he had a right to make reprisals, as he could\r\nfind opportunity. Where the heart is prepared for evil, opportunity is\r\nseldom long wanting. This Wilson learned that the Collector of the\r\nCustoms at Kirkcaldy had come to Pittenweem, in the course of his\r\nofficial round of duty, with a considerable sum of public money in his\r\ncustody. As the amount was greatly within the value of the goods which\r\nhad been seized from him, Wilson felt no scruple of conscience in\r\nresolving to reimburse himself for his losses, at the expense of the\r\nCollector and the revenue. He associated with himself one Robertson, and\r\ntwo other idle young men, whom, having been concerned in the same illicit\r\ntrade, he persuaded to view the transaction in the same justifiable light\r\nin which he himself considered it. They watched the motions of the\r\nCollector; they broke forcibly into the house where he lodged,--Wilson,\r\nwith two of his associates, entering the Collector\xc3\xads apartment, while\r\nRobertson, the fourth, kept watch at the door with a drawn cutlass in his\r\nhand. The officer of the customs, conceiving his life in danger, escaped\r\nout of his bedroom window, and fled in his shirt, so that the plunderers,\r\nwith much ease, possessed themselves of about two hundred pounds of\r\npublic money. The robbery was committed in a very audacious manner, for\r\nseveral persons were passing in the street at the time. But Robertson,\r\nrepresenting the noise they heard as a dispute or fray betwixt the\r\nCollector and the people of the house, the worthy citizens of Pittenweem\r\nfelt themselves no way called on to interfere in behalf of the obnoxious\r\nrevenue officer; so, satisfying themselves with this very superficial\r\naccount of the matter, like the Levite in the parable, they passed on the\r\nopposite side of the way. An alarm was at length given, military were\r\ncalled in, the depredators were pursued, the booty recovered, and Wilson\r\nand Robertson tried and condemned to death, chiefly on the evidence of an\r\naccomplice.\r\n\r\nMany thought that, in consideration of the men\xc3\xads erroneous opinion of the\r\nnature of the action they had committed, justice might have been\r\nsatisfied with a less forfeiture than that of two lives. On the other\r\nhand, from the audacity of the fact, a severe example was judged\r\nnecessary; and such was the opinion of the Government. When it became\r\napparent that the sentence of death was to be executed, files, and other\r\nimplements necessary for their escape, were transmitted secretly to the\r\nculprits by a friend from without. By these means they sawed a bar out of\r\none of the prison-windows, and might have made their escape, but for the\r\nobstinacy of Wilson, who, as he was daringly resolute, was doggedly\r\npertinacious of his opinion. His comrade, Robertson, a young and slender\r\nman, proposed to make the experiment of passing the foremost through the\r\ngap they had made, and enlarging it from the outside, if necessary, to\r\nallow Wilson free passage. Wilson, however, insisted on making the first\r\nexperiment, and being a robust and lusty man, he not only found it\r\nimpossible to get through betwixt the bars, but, by his struggles, he\r\njammed himself so fast, that he was unable to draw his body back again.\r\nIn these circumstances discovery became unavoidable, and sufficient\r\nprecautions were taken by the jailor to prevent any repetition of the\r\nsame attempt. Robertson uttered not a word of reflection on his companion\r\nfor the consequences of his obstinacy; but it appeared from the sequel,\r\nthat Wilson\xc3\xads mind was deeply impressed with the recollection that, but\r\nfor him, his comrade, over whose mind he exercised considerable\r\ninfluence, would not have engaged in the criminal enterprise which had\r\nterminated thus fatally; and that now he had become his destroyer a\r\nsecond time, since, but for his obstinacy, Robertson might have effected\r\nhis escape. Minds like Wilson\xc3\xads, even when exercised in evil practices,\r\nsometimes retain the power of thinking and resolving with enthusiastic\r\ngenerosity. His whole thoughts were now bent on the possibility of saving\r\nRobertson\xc3\xads life, without the least respect to his own. The resolution\r\nwhich he adopted, and the manner in which he carried it into effect, were\r\nstriking and unusual.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the tolbooth or city jail of Edinburgh, is one of three\r\nchurches into which the cathedral of St. Giles is now divided, called,\r\nfrom its vicinity, the Tolbooth Church. It was the custom that criminals\r\nunder sentence of death were brought to this church, with a sufficient\r\nguard, to hear and join in public worship on the Sabbath before\r\nexecution. It was supposed that the hearts of these unfortunate persons,\r\nhowever hardened before against feelings of devotion, could not but be\r\naccessible to them upon uniting their thoughts and voices, for the last\r\ntime, along with their fellow-mortals, in addressing their Creator. And\r\nto the rest of the congregation, it was thought it could not but be\r\nimpressive and affecting, to find their devotions mingling with those,\r\nwho, sent by the doom of an earthly tribunal to appear where the whole\r\nearth is judged, might be considered as beings trembling on the verge of\r\neternity. The practice, however edifying, has been discontinued, in\r\nconsequence of the incident we are about to detail.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman, whose duty it was to officiate in the Tolbooth Church, had\r\nconcluded an affecting discourse, part of which was particularly directed\r\nto the unfortunate men, Wilson and Robertson, who were in the pew set\r\napart for the persons in their unhappy situation, each secured betwixt\r\ntwo soldiers of the city guard. The clergyman had reminded them, that the\r\nnext congregation they must join would be that of the just, or of the\r\nunjust; that the psalms they now heard must be exchanged, in the space of\r\ntwo brief days, for eternal hallelujahs, or eternal lamentations; and\r\nthat this fearful alternative must depend upon the state to which they\r\nmight be able to bring their minds before the moment of awful\r\npreparation: that they should not despair on account of the suddenness of\r\nthe summons, but rather to feel this comfort in their misery, that,\r\nthough all who now lifted the voice, or bent the knee in conjunction with\r\nthem, lay under the same sentence of certain death, _they_ only had the\r\nadvantage of knowing the precise moment at which it should be executed\r\nupon them. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore,\xe2\x80\x9d urged the good man, his voice trembling with\r\nemotion, \xe2\x80\x9credeem the time, my unhappy brethren, which is yet left; and\r\nremember, that, with the grace of Him to whom space and time are but as\r\nnothing, salvation may yet be assured, even in the pittance of delay\r\nwhich the laws of your country afford you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobertson was observed to weep at these words; but Wilson seemed as one\r\nwhose brain had not entirely received their meaning, or whose thoughts\r\nwere deeply impressed with some different subject;--an expression so\r\nnatural to a person in his situation, that it excited neither suspicion\r\nnor surprise.\r\n\r\nThe benediction was pronounced as usual, and the congregation was\r\ndismissed, many lingering to indulge their curiosity with a more fixed\r\nlook at the two criminals, who now, as well as their guards, rose up, as\r\nif to depart when the crowd should permit them. A murmur of compassion\r\nwas heard to pervade the spectators, the more general, perhaps, on\r\naccount of the alleviating circumstances of the case; when all at once,\r\nWilson, who, as we have already noticed, was a very strong man, seized\r\ntwo of the soldiers, one with each hand, and calling at the same time to\r\nhis companion, \xe2\x80\x9cRun, Geordie, run!\xe2\x80\x9d threw himself on a third, and\r\nfastened his teeth on the collar of his coat. Robertson stood for a\r\nsecond as if thunderstruck, and unable to avail himself of the\r\nopportunity of escape; but the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cRun, run!\xe2\x80\x9d being echoed from many\r\naround, whose feelings surprised them into a very natural interest in his\r\nbehalf, he shook off the grasp of the remaining soldier, threw himself\r\nover the pew, mixed with the dispersing congregation, none of whom felt\r\ninclined to stop a poor wretch taking his last chance for his life,\r\ngained the door of the church, and was lost to all pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe generous intrepidity which Wilson had displayed on this occasion\r\naugmented the feeling of compassion which attended his fate. The public,\r\nwhere their own prejudices are not concerned, are easily engaged on the\r\nside of disinterestedness and humanity, admired Wilson\xc3\xads behaviour, and\r\nrejoiced in Robertson\xc3\xads escape. This general feeling was so great, that\r\nit excited a vague report that Wilson would be rescued at the place of\r\nexecution, either by the mob or by some of his old associates, or by some\r\nsecond extraordinary and unexpected exertion of strength and courage on\r\nhis own part. The magistrates thought it their duty to provide against\r\nthe possibility of disturbance. They ordered out, for protection of the\r\nexecution of the sentence, the greater part of their own City Guard,\r\nunder the command of Captain Porteous, a man whose name became too\r\nmemorable from the melancholy circumstances of the day, and subsequent\r\nevents. It may be necessary to say a word about this person, and the\r\ncorps which he commanded. But the subject is of importance sufficient to\r\ndeserve another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         And thou, great god of aquavitae!\r\n                         Wha sways the empire of this city\r\n                         (When fou we\xc3\xadre sometimes capernoity),\r\n\r\n                         Be thou prepared,\r\n                         To save us frae that black banditti,\r\n\r\n                         The City Guard!\r\n                                        Fergusson\xc3\xads _Daft Days._\r\n\r\nCaptain John Porteous, a name memorable in the traditions of Edinburgh,\r\nas well as in the records of criminal jurisprudence, was the son of a\r\ncitizen of Edinburgh, who endeavoured to breed him up to his own\r\nmechanical trade of a tailor. The youth, however, had a wild and\r\nirreclaimable propensity to dissipation, which finally sent him to serve\r\nin the corps long maintained in the service of the States of Holland, and\r\ncalled the Scotch Dutch. Here he learned military discipline; and,\r\nreturning afterwards, in the course of an idle and wandering life, to his\r\nnative city, his services were required by the magistrates of Edinburgh\r\nin the disturbed year 1715, for disciplining their City Guard, in which\r\nhe shortly afterwards received a captain\xc3\xads commission. It was only by his\r\nmilitary skill and an alert and resolute character as an officer of\r\npolice, that he merited this promotion, for he is said to have been a man\r\nof profligate habits, an unnatural son, and a brutal husband. He was,\r\nhowever, useful in his station, and his harsh and fierce habits rendered\r\nhim formidable to rioters or disturbers of the public peace.\r\n\r\nThe corps in which he held his command is, or perhaps we should rather\r\nsay _was,_ a body of about one hundred and twenty soldiers divided into\r\nthree companies, and regularly armed, clothed, and embodied. They were\r\nchiefly veterans who enlisted in this cogs, having the benefit of working\r\nat their trades when they were off duty. These men had the charge of\r\npreserving public order, repressing riots and street robberies, acting,\r\nin short, as an armed police, and attending on all public occasions where\r\nconfusion or popular disturbance might be expected.*\r\n\r\n* The Lord Provost was ex-officio commander and colonel of the corps,\r\nwhich might be increased to three hundred men when the times required it.\r\nNo other drum but theirs was allowed to sound on the High Street  between\r\nthe Luckenbooths and the Netherbow.\r\n\r\nPoor Fergusson, whose irregularities sometimes led him into unpleasant\r\nrencontres with these military conservators of public order, and who\r\nmentions them so often that he may be termed their poet laureate,* thus\r\nadmonishes his readers, warned doubtless by his own experience:--\r\n\r\n* [Robert Fergusson, the Scottish Poet, born 1750, died 1774.]\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cGude folk, as ye come frae the fair,\r\n                    Bide yont frae this black squad:\r\n                    There\xc3\xads nae sic savages elsewhere\r\n                    Allowed to wear cockad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, the soldiers of the City Guard, being, as we have said, in\r\ngeneral discharged veterans, who had strength enough remaining for this\r\nmunicipal duty, and being, moreover, for the greater part, Highlanders,\r\nwere neither by birth, education, nor former habits, trained to endure\r\nwith much patience the insults of the rabble, or the provoking petulance\r\nof truant schoolboys, and idle debauchees of all descriptions, with whom\r\ntheir occupation brought them into contact. On the contrary, the tempers\r\nof the poor old fellows were soured by the indignities with which the mob\r\ndistinguished them on many occasions, and frequently might have required\r\nthe soothing strains of the poet we have just quoted--\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cO soldiers! for your ain dear sakes,\r\n                    For Scotland\xc3\xads love, the Land o\xc3\xad Cakes,\r\n                    Gie not her bairns sic deadly paiks,\r\n                    Nor be sae rude,\r\n                    Wi\xc3\xad firelock or Lochaber-axe,\r\n                    As spill their bluid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn all occasions when a holiday licensed some riot and irregularity, a\r\nskirmish with these veterans was a favourite recreation with the rabble\r\nof Edinburgh. These pages may perhaps see the light when many have in\r\nfresh recollection such onsets as we allude to. But the venerable corps,\r\nwith whom the contention was held, may now be considered as totally\r\nextinct. Of late the gradual diminution of these civic soldiers reminds\r\none of the abatement of King Lear\xc3\xads hundred knights. The edicts of each\r\nsucceeding set of magistrates have, like those of Goneril and Regan,\r\ndiminished this venerable band with the similar question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat need we\r\nfive-and-twenty?--ten?--or five?\xe2\x80\x9d And it is now nearly come to, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nneed one?\xe2\x80\x9d A spectre may indeed here and there still be seen, of an old\r\ngrey-headed and grey-bearded Highlander, with war-worn features, but bent\r\ndouble by age; dressed in an old fashioned cocked-hat, bound with white\r\ntape instead of silver lace; and in coat, waistcoat, and breeches, of a\r\nmuddy-coloured red, bearing in his withered hand an ancient weapon,\r\ncalled a Lochaber-axe; a long pole, namely, with an axe at the extremity,\r\nand a hook at the back of the hatchet.*\r\n\r\n* This hook was to enable the bearer of the Lochaber-axe to scale a\r\ngateway, by grappling the top of the door, and swinging himself up by the\r\nstaff of his weapon.\r\n\r\nSuch a phantom of former days still creeps, I have been informed, round\r\nthe statue of Charles the Second, in the Parliament Square, as if the\r\nimage of a Stuart were the last refuge for any memorial of our ancient\r\nmanners; and one or two others are supposed to glide around the door of\r\nthe guardhouse assigned to them in the Luckenbooths, when their ancient\r\nrefuge in the High Street was laid low.*\r\n\r\n* This ancient corps is now entirely disbanded. Their last march to do\r\nduty at Hallowfair had something in it affecting. Their drums and fifes\r\nhad been wont on better days to play, on this joyous occasion, the lively\r\ntune of \xe2\x80\x9cJockey to the fair;\xe2\x80\x9d but on his final occasion the afflicted\r\nveterans moved slowly to the dirge of\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time I came ower the muir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the fate of manuscripts bequeathed to friends and executors is so\r\nuncertain, that the narrative containing these frail memorials of the old\r\nTown Guard of Edinburgh, who, with their grim and valiant corporal, John\r\nDhu (the fiercest-looking fellow I ever saw), were, in my boyhood, the\r\nalternate terror and derision of the petulant brood of the High School,\r\nmay, perhaps, only come to light when all memory of the institution has\r\nfaded away, and then serve as an illustration of Kay\xc3\xads caricatures, who\r\nhas preserved the features of some of their heroes. In the preceding\r\ngeneration, when there was a perpetual alarm for the plots and activity\r\nof the Jacobites, some pains were taken by the magistrates of Edinburgh\r\nto keep this corps, though composed always of such materials as we have\r\nnoticed, in a more effective state than was afterwards judged necessary,\r\nwhen their most dangerous service was to skirmish with the rabble on the\r\nking\xc3\xads birthday. They were, therefore, more the objects of hatred, and\r\nless that of scorn, than they were afterwards accounted.\r\n\r\nTo Captain John Porteous, the honour of his command and of his corps\r\nseems to have been a matter of high interest and importance. He was\r\nexceedingly incensed against Wilson for the affront which he construed\r\nhim to have put upon his soldiers, in the effort he made for the\r\nliberation of his companion, and expressed himself most ardently on the\r\nsubject. He was no less indignant at the report, that there was an\r\nintention to rescue Wilson himself from the gallows, and uttered many\r\nthreats and imprecations upon that subject, which were afterwards\r\nremembered to his disadvantage. In fact, if a good deal of determination\r\nand promptitude rendered Porteous, in one respect, fit to command guards\r\ndesigned to suppress popular commotion, he seems, on the other, to have\r\nbeen disqualified for a charge so delicate, by a hot and surly temper,\r\nalways too ready to come to blows and violence; a character void of\r\nprinciple; and a disposition to regard the rabble, who seldom failed to\r\nregale him and his soldiers with some marks of their displeasure, as\r\ndeclared enemies, upon whom it was natural and justifiable that he should\r\nseek opportunities of vengeance. Being, however, the most active and\r\ntrustworthy among the captains of the City Guard, he was the person to\r\nwhom the magistrates confided the command of the soldiers appointed to\r\nkeep the peace at the time of Wilson\xc3\xads execution. He was ordered to guard\r\nthe gallows and scaffold, with about eighty men, all the disposable force\r\nthat could be spared for that duty.\r\n\r\nBut the magistrates took farther precautions, which affected Porteous\xc3\xads\r\npride very deeply. They requested the assistance of part of a regular\r\ninfantry regiment, not to attend upon the execution, but to remain drawn\r\nup on the principal street of the city, during the time that it went\r\nforward, in order to intimidate the multitude, in case they should be\r\ndisposed to be unruly, with a display of force which could not be\r\nresisted without desperation. It may sound ridiculous in our ears,\r\nconsidering the fallen state of this ancient civic corps, that its\r\nofficer should have felt punctiliously jealous of its honour. Yet so it\r\nwas. Captain Porteous resented, as an indignity, the introducing the\r\nWelsh Fusileers within the city, and drawing them up in the street where\r\nno drums but his own were allowed to be sounded without the special\r\ncommand or permission of the magistrates. As he could not show his\r\nill-humour to his patrons the magistrates, it increased his indignation\r\nand his desire to be revenged on the unfortunate criminal Wilson, and all\r\nwho favoured him. These internal emotions of jealousy and rage wrought a\r\nchange on the man\xc3\xads mien and bearing, visible to all who saw him on the\r\nfatal morning when Wilson was appointed to suffer. Porteous\xc3\xads ordinary\r\nappearance was rather favourable. He was about the middle size, stout,\r\nand well made, having a military air, and yet rather a gentle and mild\r\ncountenance. His complexion was brown, his face somewhat fretted with the\r\nsears of the smallpox, his eyes rather languid than keen or fierce. On\r\nthe present occasion, however, it seemed to those who saw him as if he\r\nwere agitated by some evil demon. His step was irregular, his voice\r\nhollow and broken, his countenance pale, his eyes staring and wild, his\r\nspeech imperfect and confused, and his whole appearance so disordered,\r\nthat many remarked he seemed to be _fey,_ a Scottish expression, meaning\r\nthe state of those who are driven on to their impending fate by the\r\nstrong impulse of some irresistible necessity.\r\n\r\nOne part of his conduct was truly diabolical, if indeed it has not been\r\nexaggerated by the general prejudice entertained against his memory. When\r\nWilson, the unhappy criminal, was delivered to him by the keeper of the\r\nprison, in order that he might be conducted to the place of execution,\r\nPorteous, not satisfied with the usual precautions to prevent escape,\r\nordered him to be manacled. This might be justifiable from the character\r\nand bodily strength of the malefactor, as well as from the apprehensions\r\nso generally entertained of an expected rescue. But the handcuffs which\r\nwere produced being found too small for the wrists of a man so big-boned\r\nas Wilson, Porteous proceeded with his own hands, and by great exertion\r\nof strength, to force them till they clasped together, to the exquisite\r\ntorture of the unhappy criminal. Wilson remonstrated against such\r\nbarbarous usage, declaring that the pain distracted his thoughts from the\r\nsubjects of meditation proper to his unhappy condition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt signifies little,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Porteous; \xe2\x80\x9cyour pain will soon be\r\nat an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cruelty is great,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sufferer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know not how soon\r\nyou yourself may have occasion to ask the mercy which you are now\r\nrefusing to a fellow-creature. May God forgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words, long afterwards quoted and remembered, were all that passed\r\nbetween Porteous and his prisoner; but as they took air, and became known\r\nto the people, they greatly increased the popular compassion for Wilson,\r\nand excited a proportionate degree of indignation against Porteous;\r\nagainst whom, as strict, and even violent in the discharge of his\r\nunpopular office, the common people had some real, and many imaginary\r\ncauses of complaint.\r\n\r\nWhen the painful procession was completed, and Wilson, with the escort,\r\nhad arrived at the scaffold in the Grassmarket, there appeared no signs\r\nof that attempt to rescue him which had occasioned such precautions. The\r\nmultitude, in general, looked on with deeper interest than at ordinary\r\nexecutions; and there might be seen, on the countenances of many, a stern\r\nand indignant expression, like that with which the ancient Cameronians\r\nmight be supposed to witness the execution of their brethren, who\r\nglorified the Covenant on the same occasion, and at the same spot. But\r\nthere was no attempt at violence. Wilson himself seemed disposed to\r\nhasten over the space that divided time from eternity. The devotions\r\nproper and usual on such occasions were no sooner finished than he\r\nsubmitted to his fate, and the sentence of the law was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nHe had been suspended on the gibbet so long as to be totally deprived of\r\nlife, when at once, as if occasioned by some newly received impulse,\r\nthere arose a tumult among the multitude. Many stones were thrown at\r\nPorteous and his guards; some mischief was done; and the mob continued to\r\npress forward with whoops, shrieks, howls, and exclamations. A young\r\nfellow, with a sailor\xc3\xads cap slouched over his face, sprung on the\r\nscaffold, and cut the rope by which the criminal was suspended. Others\r\napproached to carry off the body, either to secure for it a decent grave,\r\nor to try, perhaps, some means of resuscitation. Captain Porteous was\r\nwrought, by this appearance of insurrection against his authority, into a\r\nrage so headlong as made him forget, that, the sentence having been fully\r\nexecuted, it was his duty not to engage in hostilities with the misguided\r\nmultitude, but to draw off his men as fast as possible. He sprung from\r\nthe scaffold, snatched a musket from one of his soldiers, commanded the\r\nparty to give fire, and, as several eye-witnesses concurred in swearing,\r\nset them the example, by discharging his piece, and shooting a man dead\r\non the spot. Several soldiers obeyed his command or followed his example;\r\nsix or seven persons were slain, and a great many were hurt and wounded.\r\n\r\nAfter this act of violence, the Captain proceeded to withdraw his men\r\ntowards their guard-house in the High Street. The mob were not so much\r\nintimidated as incensed by what had been done. They pursued the soldiers\r\nwith execrations, accompanied by volleys of stones. As they pressed on\r\nthem, the rearmost soldiers turned, and again fired with fatal aim and\r\nexecution. It is not accurately known whether Porteous commanded this\r\nsecond act of violence; but of course the odium of the whole transactions\r\nof the fatal day attached to him, and to him alone. He arrived at the\r\nguard-house, dismissed his soldiers, and went to make his report to the\r\nmagistrates concerning the unfortunate events of the day.\r\n\r\nApparently by this time Captain Porteous had began to doubt the propriety\r\nof his own conduct, and the reception he met with from the magistrates\r\nwas such as to make him still more anxious to gloss it over. He denied\r\nthat he had given orders to fire; he denied he had fired with his own\r\nhand; he even produced the fusee which he carried as an officer for\r\nexamination; it was found still loaded. Of three cartridges which he was\r\nseen to put in his pouch that morning, two were still there; a white\r\nhandkerchief was thrust into the muzzle of the piece, and re-turned\r\nunsoiled or blackened. To the defence founded on these circumstances it\r\nwas answered, that Porteous had not used his own piece, but had been seen\r\nto take one from a soldier. Among the many who had been killed and\r\nwounded by the unhappy fire, there were several of better rank; for even\r\nthe humanity of such soldiers as fired over the heads of the mere rabble\r\naround the scaffold, proved in some instances fatal to persons who were\r\nstationed in windows, or observed the melancholy scene from a distance.\r\nThe voice of public indignation was loud and general; and, ere men\xc3\xads\r\ntempers had time to cool, the trial of Captain Porteous took place before\r\nthe High Court of Justiciary. After a long and patient hearing, the jury\r\nhad the difficult duty of balancing the positive evidence of many\r\npersons, and those of respectability, who deposed positively to the\r\nprisoner\xc3\xads commanding his soldiers to fire, and himself firing his piece,\r\nof which some swore that they saw the smoke and flash, and beheld a man\r\ndrop at whom it was pointed, with the negative testimony of others, who,\r\nthough well stationed for seeing what had passed, neither heard Porteous\r\ngive orders to fire, nor saw him fire himself; but, on the contrary,\r\naverred that the first shot was fired by a soldier who stood close by\r\nhim. A great part of his defence was also founded on the turbulence of\r\nthe mob, which witnesses, according to their feelings, their\r\npredilections, and their opportunities of observation, represented\r\ndifferently; some describing as a formidable riot, what others\r\nrepresented as a trifling disturbance such as always used to take place\r\non the like occasions, when the executioner of the law, and the men\r\ncommissioned to protect him in his task, were generally exposed to some\r\nindignities. The verdict of the jury sufficiently shows how the evidence\r\npreponderated in their minds. It declared that John Porteous fired a gun\r\namong the people assembled at the execution; that he gave orders to his\r\nsoldiers to fire, by which many persons were killed and wounded; but, at\r\nthe same time, that the prisoner and his guard had been wounded and\r\nbeaten, by stones thrown at them by the multitude. Upon this verdict, the\r\nLords of Justiciary passed sentence of death against Captain John\r\nPorteous, adjudging him, in the common form, to be hanged on a gibbet at\r\nthe common place of execution, on Wednesday, 8th September 1736, and all\r\nhis movable property to be forfeited to the king\xc3\xads use, according to the\r\nScottish law in cases of wilful murder.*\r\n\r\n* The signatures affixed to the death-warrant of Captain Porteous were--\r\nAndrew Fletcher of Milton, Lord Justice-Clerk.\r\nSir James Mackenzie, Lord Royston.\r\nDavid Erskine, Lord Dun.\r\nSir Walter Pringle, Lord Newhall.\r\nSir Gilbert Elliot, Lord Minto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9cThe hour\xc3\xads come, but not the man.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* There is a tradition, that while a little stream was swollen into a\r\ntorrent by recent showers, the discontented voice of the Water Spirit was\r\nheard to pronounce these words. At the some moment a man, urged on by his\r\nfate, or, in Scottish language, _fey,_ arrived at a gallop, and prepared\r\nto cross the water. No remonstrance from the bystanders was of power to\r\nstop him--he plunged into the stream, and perished.\r\n\r\n\r\nKelpie.\r\n\r\nOn the day when the unhappy Porteous was expected to suffer the sentence\r\nof the law, the place of execution, extensive as it is, was crowded\r\nalmost to suffocation. There was not a window in all the lofty tenements\r\naround it, or in the steep and crooked street called the Bow, by which\r\nthe fatal procession was to descend from the High Street, that was not\r\nabsolutely filled with spectators. The uncommon height and antique\r\nappearance of these houses, some of which were formerly the property of\r\nthe Knights Templars, and the Knights of St. John, and still exhibit on\r\ntheir fronts and gables the iron cross of these orders, gave additional\r\neffect to a scene in itself so striking. The area of the Grassmarket\r\nresembled a huge dark lake or sea of human heads, in the centre of which\r\narose the fatal tree, tall, black, and ominous, from which dangled the\r\ndeadly halter. Every object takes interest from its uses and\r\nassociations, and the erect beam and empty noose, things so simple in\r\nthemselves, became, on such an occasion, objects of terror and of solemn\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAmid so numerous an assembly there was scarcely a word spoken, save in\r\nwhispers. The thirst of vengeance was in some degree allayed by its\r\nsupposed certainty; and even the populace, with deeper feeling than they\r\nare wont to entertain, suppressed all clamorous exultation, and prepared\r\nto enjoy the scene of retaliation in triumph, silent and decent, though\r\nstern and relentless. It seemed as if the depth of their hatred to the\r\nunfortunate criminal scorned to display itself in anything resembling the\r\nmore noisy current of their ordinary feelings. Had a stranger consulted\r\nonly the evidence of his ears, he might have supposed that so vast a\r\nmultitude were assembled for some purpose which affected them with the\r\ndeepest sorrow, and stilled those noises which, on all ordinary\r\noccasions, arise from such a concourse; but if he had gazed upon their\r\nfaces, he would have been instantly undeceived. The compressed lip, the\r\nbent brow, the stern and flashing eye of almost everyone on whom he\r\nlooked, conveyed the expression of men come to glut their sight with\r\ntriumphant revenge. It is probable that the appearance of the criminal\r\nmight have somewhat changed the temper of the populace in his favour, and\r\nthat they might in the moment of death have forgiven the man against whom\r\ntheir resentment had been so fiercely heated. It had, however, been\r\ndestined, that the mutability of their sentiments was not to be exposed\r\nto this trial.\r\n\r\nThe usual hour for producing the criminal had been past for many minutes,\r\nyet the spectators observed no symptom of his appearance. \xe2\x80\x9cWould they\r\nventure to defraud public justice?\xe2\x80\x9d was the question which men began\r\nanxiously to ask at each other. The first answer in every case was bold\r\nand positive,--\xe2\x80\x9cThey dare not.\xe2\x80\x9d But when the point was further canvassed,\r\nother opinions were entertained, and various causes of doubt were\r\nsuggested. Porteous had been a favourite officer of the magistracy of the\r\ncity, which, being a numerous and fluctuating body, requires for its\r\nsupport a degree of energy in its functionaries, which the individuals\r\nwho compose it cannot at all times alike be supposed to possess in their\r\nown persons. It was remembered, that in the Information for Porteous (the\r\npaper, namely, in which his case was stated to the Judges of the criminal\r\ncourt), he had been described by his counsel as the person on whom the\r\nmagistrates chiefly relied in all emergencies of uncommon difficulty. It\r\nwas argued, too, that his conduct, on the unhappy occasion of Wilson\xc3\xads\r\nexecution, was capable of being attributed to an imprudent excess of zeal\r\nin the execution of his duty, a motive for which those under whose\r\nauthority he acted might be supposed to have great sympathy. And as these\r\nconsiderations might move the magistrates to make a favourable\r\nrepresentation of Porteous\xc3\xads case, there were not wanting others in the\r\nhigher departments of Government, which would make such suggestions\r\nfavourably listened to.\r\n\r\nThe mob of Edinburgh, when thoroughly excited, had been at all times one\r\nof the fiercest which could be found in Europe; and of late years they\r\nhad risen repeatedly against the Government, and sometimes not without\r\ntemporary success. They were conscious, therefore, that they were no\r\nfavourites with the rulers of the period, and that, if Captain Porteous\xc3\xads\r\nviolence was not altogether regarded as good service, it might certainly\r\nbe thought, that to visit it with a capital punishment would render it\r\nboth delicate and dangerous for future officers, in the same\r\ncircumstances, to act with effect in repressing tumults. There is also a\r\nnatural feeling, on the part of all members of Government, for the\r\ngeneral maintenance of authority; and it seemed not unlikely, that what\r\nto the relatives of the sufferers appeared a wanton and unprovoked\r\nmassacre, should be otherwise viewed in the cabinet of St. James\xc3\xads. It\r\nmight be there supposed, that upon the whole matter, Captain Porteous was\r\nin the exercise of a trust delegated to him by the lawful civil\r\nauthority; that he had been assaulted by the populace, and several of his\r\nmen hurt; and that, in finally repelling force by force, his conduct\r\ncould be fairly imputed to no other motive than self-defence in the\r\ndischarge of his duty.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, of themselves very powerful, induced the spectators\r\nto apprehend the possibility of a reprieve; and to the various causes\r\nwhich might interest the rulers in his favour, the lower part of the\r\nrabble added one which was peculiarly well adapted to their\r\ncomprehension. It was averred, in order to increase the odium against\r\nPorteous, that while he repressed with the utmost severity the slightest\r\nexcesses of the poor, he not only overlooked the license of the young\r\nnobles and gentry, but was very willing to lend them the countenance of\r\nhis official authority, in execution of such loose pranks as it was\r\nchiefly his duty to have restrained. This suspicion, which was perhaps\r\nmuch exaggerated, made a deep impression on the minds of the populace;\r\nand when several of the higher rank joined in a petition, recommending\r\nPorteous to the mercy of the Crown, it was generally supposed he owed\r\ntheir favour not to any conviction of the hardship of his case, but to\r\nthe fear of losing a convenient accomplice in their debaucheries. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to say how much this suspicion augmented the people\xc3\xads\r\ndetestation of this obnoxious criminal, as well as their fear of his\r\nescaping the sentence pronounced against him.\r\n\r\nWhile these arguments were stated and replied to, and canvassed and\r\nsupported, the hitherto silent expectation of the people became changed\r\ninto that deep and agitating murmur, which is sent forth by the ocean\r\nbefore the tempest begins to howl. The crowded populace, as if their\r\nmotions had corresponded with the unsettled state of their minds,\r\nfluctuated to and fro without any visible cause of impulse, like the\r\nagitation of the waters, called by sailors the ground-swell. The news,\r\nwhich the magistrates had almost hesitated to communicate to them, were\r\nat length announced, and spread among the spectators with a rapidity like\r\nlightning. A reprieve from the Secretary of State\xc3\xads office, under the\r\nhand of his Grace the Duke of Newcastle, had arrived, intimating the\r\npleasure of Queen Caroline (regent of the kingdom during the absence of\r\nGeorge II. on the Continent), that the execution of the sentence of death\r\npronounced against John Porteous, late Captain-Lieutenant of the City\r\nGuard of Edinburgh, present prisoner in the Tolbooth of that city, be\r\nrespited for six weeks from the time appointed for his execution.\r\n\r\nThe assembled spectators of almost all degrees, whose minds had been\r\nwound up to the pitch which we have described, uttered a groan, or rather\r\na roar of indignation and disappointed revenge, similar to that of a\r\ntiger from whom his meal has been rent by his keeper when he was just\r\nabout to devour it. This fierce exclamation seemed to forbode some\r\nimmediate explosion of popular resentment, and, in fact, such had been\r\nexpected by the magistrates, and the necessary measures had been taken to\r\nrepress it. But the shout was not repeated, nor did any sudden tumult\r\nensue, such as it appeared to announce. The populace seemed to be ashamed\r\nof having expressed their disappointment in a vain clamour, and the sound\r\nchanged, not into the silence which had preceded the arrival of these\r\nstunning news, but into stifled mutterings, which each group maintained\r\namong themselves, and which were blended into one deep and hoarse murmur\r\nwhich floated above the assembly.\r\n\r\nYet still, though all expectation of the execution was over, the mob\r\nremained assembled, stationary, as it were, through very resentment,\r\ngazing on the preparations for death, which had now been made in vain,\r\nand stimulating their feelings, by recalling the various claims which\r\nWilson might have had on royal mercy, from the mistaken motives on which\r\nhe acted, as well as from the generosity he had displayed towards his\r\naccomplice. \xe2\x80\x9cThis man,\xe2\x80\x9d they said,--\xe2\x80\x9cthe brave, the resolute, the\r\ngenerous, was executed to death without mercy for stealing a purse of\r\ngold, which in some sense he might consider as a fair reprisal; while the\r\nprofligate satellite, who took advantage of a trifling tumult,\r\ninseparable from such occasions, to shed the blood of twenty of his\r\nfellow-citizens, is deemed a fitting object for the exercise of the royal\r\nprerogative of mercy. Is this to be borne?--would our fathers have borne\r\nit? Are not we, like them, Scotsmen and burghers of Edinburgh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officers of justice began now to remove the scaffold, and other\r\npreparations which had been made for the execution, in hopes, by doing\r\nso, to accelerate the dispersion of the multitude. The measure had the\r\ndesired effect; for no sooner had the fatal tree been unfixed from the\r\nlarge stone pedestal or socket in which it was secured, and sunk slowly\r\ndown upon the wain intended to remove it to the place where it was\r\nusually deposited, than the populace, after giving vent to their feelings\r\nin a second shout of rage and mortification, began slowly to disperse to\r\ntheir usual abodes and occupations.\r\n\r\nThe windows were in like manner gradually deserted, and groups of the\r\nmore decent class of citizens formed themselves, as if waiting to return\r\nhomewards when the streets should be cleared of the rabble. Contrary to\r\nwhat is frequently the case, this description of persons agreed in\r\ngeneral with the sentiments of their inferiors, and considered the cause\r\nas common to all ranks. Indeed, as we have already noticed, it was by no\r\nmeans amongst the lowest class of the spectators, or those most likely to\r\nbe engaged in the riot at Wilson\xc3\xads execution, that the fatal fire of\r\nPorteous\xc3\xads soldiers had taken effect. Several persons were killed who\r\nwere looking out at windows at the scene, who could not of course belong\r\nto the rioters, and were persons of decent rank and condition. The\r\nburghers, therefore, resenting the loss which had fallen on their own\r\nbody, and proud and tenacious of their rights, as the citizens of\r\nEdinburgh have at all times been, were greatly exasperated at the\r\nunexpected respite of Captain Porteous.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed at the time, and afterwards more particularly remembered,\r\nthat, while the mob were in the act of dispersing, several individuals\r\nwere seen busily passing from one place and one group of people to\r\nanother, remaining long with none, but whispering for a little time with\r\nthose who appeared to be declaiming most violently against the conduct of\r\nGovernment. These active agents had the appearance of men from the\r\ncountry, and were generally supposed to be old friends and confederates\r\nof Wilson, whose minds were of course highly excited against Porteous.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it was the intention of these men to stir the multitude to\r\nany sudden act of mutiny, it seemed for the time to be fruitless. The\r\nrabble, as well as the more decent part of the assembly, dispersed, and\r\nwent home peaceably; and it was only by observing the moody discontent on\r\ntheir brows, or catching the tenor of the conversation they held with\r\neach other, that a stranger could estimate the state of their minds. We\r\nwill give the reader this advantage, by associating ourselves with one of\r\nthe numerous groups who were painfully ascending the steep declivity of\r\nthe West Bow, to return to their dwellings in the Lawnmarket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn unco thing this, Mrs. Howden,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Peter Plumdamas to his\r\nneighbour the rouping-wife, or saleswoman, as he offered her his arm to\r\nassist her in the toilsome ascent, \xe2\x80\x9cto see the grit folk at Lunnon set\r\ntheir face against law and gospel, and let loose sic a reprobate as\r\nPorteous upon a peaceable town!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think o\xc3\xad the weary walk they hae gien us,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Howden,\r\nwith a groan; \xe2\x80\x9cand sic a comfortable window as I had gotten, too, just\r\nwithin a penny-stane-cast of the scaffold--I could hae heard every word\r\nthe minister said--and to pay twalpennies for my stand, and a\xc3\xad for\r\nnaething!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am judging,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Plumdamas, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this reprieve wadna stand gude\r\nin the auld Scots law, when the kingdom was a kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken muckle about the law,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Howden; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I ken,\r\nwhen we had a king, and a chancellor, and parliament men o\xc3\xad our ain, we\r\ncould aye peeble them wi\xc3\xad stanes when they werena gude bairns--But\r\nnaebody\xc3\xads nails can reach the length o\xc3\xad Lunnon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeary on Lunnon, and a\xc3\xad that e\xc3\xader came out o\xc3\xadt!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Grizel\r\nDamahoy, an ancient seamstress; \xe2\x80\x9cthey hae taen away our parliament, and\r\nthey hae oppressed our trade. Our gentles will hardly allow that a Scots\r\nneedle can sew ruffles on a sark, or lace on an owerlay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may say that--Miss Damahoy, and I ken o\xc3\xad them that hae gotten raisins\r\nfrae Lunnon by forpits at ance,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Plumdamas; \xe2\x80\x9cand then sic an\r\nhost of idle English gaugers and excisemen as hae come down to vex and\r\ntorment us, that an honest man canna fetch sae muckle as a bit anker o\xc3\xad\r\nbrandy frae Leith to the Lawnmarket, but he\xc3\xads like to be rubbit o\xc3\xad the\r\nvery gudes he\xc3\xads bought and paid for.--Weel, I winna justify Andrew Wilson\r\nfor pitting hands on what wasna his; but if he took nae mair than his\r\nain, there\xc3\xads an awfu\xc3\xad difference between that and the fact this man\r\nstands for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ye speak about the law,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Howden, \xe2\x80\x9chere comes Mr.\r\nSaddletree, that can settle it as weel as ony on the bench.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe party she mentioned, a grave elderly person, with a superb periwig,\r\ndressed in a decent suit of sad-coloured clothes, came up as she spoke,\r\nand courteously gave his arm to Miss Grizel Damahoy.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to mention, that Mr. Bartoline Saddletree kept an\r\nexcellent and highly-esteemed shop for harness, saddles, &c. &c., at the\r\nsign of the Golden Nag, at the head of Bess Wynd.*\r\n\r\n* [Maitland calls it Best\xc3\xads Wynd, and later writers Beth\xc3\xads Wynd. As the\r\nname implies, it was an open thoroughfare or alley leading from the\r\nLawnmarket, and extended in a direct line between the old Tolbooth to\r\nnear the head of the Cowgate. It was partly destroyed by fire in 1786,\r\nand was totally removed in 1809, preparatory to the building of the new\r\nlibraries of the Faculty of Advocates and writers to the Signet.]\r\n\r\nHis genius, however (as he himself and most of his neighbours conceived),\r\nlay towards the weightier matters of the law, and he failed not to give\r\nfrequent attendance upon the pleadings and arguments of the lawyers and\r\njudges in the neighbouring square, where, to say the truth, he was\r\noftener to be found than would have consisted with his own emolument; but\r\nthat his wife, an active painstaking person, could, in his absence, make\r\nan admirable shift to please the customers and scold the journeymen. This\r\ngood lady was in the habit of letting her husband take his way, and go on\r\nimproving his stock of legal knowledge without interruption; but, as if\r\nin requital, she insisted upon having her own will in the domestic and\r\ncommercial departments which he abandoned to her. Now, as Bartoline\r\nSaddletree had a considerable gift of words, which he mistook for\r\neloquence, and conferred more liberally upon the society in which he\r\nlived than was at all times gracious and acceptable, there went forth a\r\nsaying, with which wags used sometimes to interrupt his rhetoric, that,\r\nas he had a golden nag at his door, so he had a grey mare in his shop.\r\nThis reproach induced Mr. Saddletree, on all occasions, to assume rather\r\na haughty and stately tone towards his good woman, a circumstance by\r\nwhich she seemed very little affected, unless he attempted to exercise\r\nany real authority, when she never failed to fly into open rebellion. But\r\nsuch extremes Bartoline seldom provoked; for, like the gentle King Jamie,\r\nhe was fonder of talking of authority than really exercising it. This\r\nturn of mind was, on the whole, lucky for him; since his substance was\r\nincreased without any trouble on his part, or any interruption of his\r\nfavourite studies.\r\n\r\nThis word in explanation has been thrown in to the reader, while\r\nSaddletree was laying down, with great precision, the law upon Porteous\xc3\xads\r\ncase, by which he arrived at this conclusion, that, if Porteous had fired\r\nfive minutes sooner, before Wilson was cut down, he would have been\r\n_versans in licito;_ engaged, that is, in a lawful act, and only liable\r\nto be punished _propter excessum,_ or for lack of discretion, which might\r\nhave mitigated the punishment to _poena ordinaria._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscretion!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mrs. Howden, on whom, it may well be supposed, the\r\nfineness of this distinction was entirely thrown away,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhan had Jock\r\nPorteous either grace, discretion, or gude manners?--I mind when his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mrs. Howden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Damahoy, \xe2\x80\x9cmind when his mother\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Damahoy,\xe2\x80\x9d entreated the interrupted orator\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Plumdamas, \xe2\x80\x9cmind when his wife\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Plumdamas--Mrs. Howden--Miss Damahoy,\xe2\x80\x9d again implored the\r\norator,--\xe2\x80\x9cMind the distinction, as Counsellor Crossmyloof says--\xc3\xabI,\xc3\xad\r\nsays he, \xc3\xabtake a distinction.\xc3\xad Now, the body of the criminal being cut\r\ndown, and the execution ended, Porteous was no longer official; the act\r\nwhich he came to protect and guard, being done and ended, he was no\r\nbetter than _cuivis ex populo._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quivis--quivis,_ Mr. Saddletree, craving your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said (with a\r\nprolonged emphasis on the first syllable) Mr. Butler, the\r\ndeputy-schoolmaster of a parish near Edinburgh, who at that moment came\r\nup behind them as the false Latin was uttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat signifies interrupting me, Mr. Butler?--but I am glad to see ye\r\nnotwithstanding--I speak after Counsellor Crossmyloof, and he said\r\n_cuivis._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Counsellor Crossmyloof used the dative for the nominative, I would\r\nhave crossed his loof with a tight leathern strap, Mr. Saddletree; there\r\nis not a boy on the booby form but should have been scourged for such a\r\nsolecism in grammar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak Latin like a lawyer, Mr. Butler, and not like a schoolmaster,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n retorted Saddletree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScarce like a schoolboy, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt matters little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartoline; \xe2\x80\x9call I mean to say is, that Porteous\r\nhas become liable to the _poena extra ordinem,_ or capital\r\npunishment--which is to say, in plain Scotch, the gallows--simply\r\nbecause he did not fire when he was in office, but waited till the body\r\nwas cut down, the execution whilk he had in charge to guard implemented,\r\nand he himself exonered of the public trust imposed on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Plumdamas, \xe2\x80\x9cdo ye really think John\r\nPorteous\xc3\xads case wad hae been better if he had begun firing before ony\r\nstanes were flung at a\xc3\xad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed do I, neighbour Plumdamas,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bartoline, confidently, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nbeing then in point of trust and in point of power, the execution being\r\nbut inchoat, or, at least, not implemented, or finally ended; but after\r\nWilson was cut down it was a\xc3\xad ower--he was clean exauctorate, and had nae\r\nmair ado but to get awa wi\xc3\xad his guard up this West Bow as fast as if\r\nthere had been a caption after him--And this is law, for I heard it laid\r\ndown by Lord Vincovincentem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVincovincentem?--Is he a lord of state, or a lord of seat?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nMrs. Howden.*\r\n\r\n* A nobleman was called a Lord of State. The Senators of the College * of\r\nJustice were termed Lords of Seat, or of the Session.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lord of seat--a lord of session.--I fash mysell little wi\xc3\xad lords o\xc3\xad\r\nstate; they vex me wi\xc3\xad a wheen idle questions about their saddles, and\r\ncurpels, and holsters and horse-furniture, and what they\xc3\xadll cost, and\r\nwhan they\xc3\xadll be ready--a wheen galloping geese--my wife may serve the\r\nlike o\xc3\xad them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so might she, in her day, hae served the best lord in the land, for\r\nas little as ye think o\xc3\xad her, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Howden, somewhat\r\nindignant at the contemptuous way in which her gossip was mentioned;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen she and I were twa gilpies, we little thought to hae sitten doun\r\nwi\xc3\xad the like o\xc3\xad my auld Davie Howden, or you either, Mr. Saddletree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Saddletree, who was not bright at a reply, was cudgelling his\r\nbrains for an answer to this homethrust, Miss Damahoy broke in on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as for the lords of state,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Damahoy, \xe2\x80\x9cye suld mind the\r\nriding o\xc3\xad the parliament, Mr. Saddletree, in the gude auld time before\r\nthe Union,--a year\xc3\xads rent o\xc3\xad mony a gude estate gaed for horse-graith and\r\nharnessing, forby broidered robes and foot-mantles, that wad hae stude by\r\ntheir lane wi\xc3\xad gold brocade, and that were muckle in my ain line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and then the lusty banqueting, with sweetmeats and comfits wet and\r\ndry, and dried fruits of divers sorts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Plumdamas. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Scotland was\r\nScotland in these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll tell ye what it is, neighbours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Howden, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll ne\xc3\xader\r\nbelieve Scotland is Scotland ony mair, if our kindly Scots sit doun with\r\nthe affront they hae gien us this day. It\xc3\xads not only the blude that _is_\r\nshed, but the blude that might hae been shed, that\xc3\xads required at our\r\nhands; there was my daughter\xc3\xads wean, little Eppie Daidle--my oe, ye ken,\r\nMiss Grizel--had played the truant frae the school, as bairns will do, ye\r\nken, Mr. Butler?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for which,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected Mr. Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cthey should be soundly scourged\r\nby their well-wishers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd had just cruppen to the gallows\xc3\xad foot to see the hanging, as was\r\nnatural for a wean; and what for mightna she hae been shot as weel as the\r\nrest o\xc3\xad them, and where wad we a\xc3\xad hae been then? I wonder how Queen\r\nCarline (if her name be Carline) wad hae liked to hae had ane o\xc3\xad her ain\r\nbairns in sic a venture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReport says,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cthat such a circumstance would not have\r\ndistressed her majesty beyond endurance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Howden, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sum o\xc3\xad the matter is, that, were I a man,\r\nI wad hae amends o\xc3\xad Jock Porteous, be the upshot what like o\xc3\xadt, if a\xc3\xad the\r\ncarles and carlines in England had sworn to the nay-say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would claw down the Tolbooth door wi\xc3\xad my nails,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Grizel,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I wad be at him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may be very right, ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I would not advise you\r\nto speak so loud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed both the ladies together, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be naething else\r\nspoken about frae the Weigh-house to the Water-gate, till this is either\r\nended or mended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe females now departed to their respective places of abode. Plumdamas\r\njoined the other two gentlemen in drinking their _meridian_ (a\r\nbumper-dram of brandy), as they passed the well-known low-browed shop in\r\nthe Lawnmarket, where they were wont to take that refreshment. Mr.\r\nPlumdamas then departed towards his shop, and Mr. Butler, who happened to\r\nhave some particular occasion for the rein of an old bridle (the truants\r\nof that busy day could have anticipated its application), walked down the\r\nLawnmarket with Mr. Saddletree, each talking as he could get a word\r\nthrust in, the one on the laws of Scotland, the other on those of syntax,\r\nand neither listening to a word which his companion uttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Elswhair he colde right weel lay down the law,\r\n                But in his house was meek as is a daw.\r\n                                                  Davie Lindsay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been Jock Driver the carrier here, speering about his new\r\ngraith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Saddletree to her husband, as he crossed his\r\nthreshold, not with the purpose, by any means, of consulting him upon his\r\nown affairs, but merely to intimate, by a gentle recapitulation, how much\r\nduty she had gone through in his absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bartoline, and deigned not a word more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the laird of Girdingburst has had his running footman here, and ca\xc3\xadd\r\nhimsell (he\xc3\xads a civil pleasant young gentleman), to see when the\r\nbroidered saddle-cloth for his sorrel horse will be ready, for he wants\r\nit agane the Kelso races.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, aweel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bartoline, as laconically as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his lordship, the Earl of Blazonbury, Lord Flash and Flame, is like\r\nto be clean daft, that the harness for the six Flanders mears, wi\xc3\xad the\r\ncrests, coronets, housings, and mountings conform, are no sent hame\r\naccording to promise gien.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, weel, weel--weel, weel, gudewife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cif he gangs\r\ndaft, we\xc3\xadll hae him cognosced--it\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad very weel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads weel that ye think sae, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his helpmate,\r\nrather nettled at the indifference with which her report was received;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads mony ane wad hae thought themselves affronted, if sae mony\r\ncustomers had ca\xc3\xadd and naebody to answer them but women-folk; for a\xc3\xad the\r\nlads were aff, as soon as your back was turned, to see Porteous hanged,\r\nthat might be counted upon; and sae, you no being at hame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHouts, Mrs. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartoline, with an air of consequence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdinna deave me wi\xc3\xad your nonsense; I was under the necessity of being\r\nelsewhere--_non omnia_--as Mr. Crossmyloof said, when he was called by\r\ntwo macers at once--_non omnia possumus--pessimus--possimis_--I ken our\r\nlaw-latin offends Mr. Butler\xc3\xads ears, but it means, Naebody, an it were\r\nthe Lord President himsell, can do twa turns at ance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery right, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his careful helpmate, with a\r\nsarcastic smile; \xe2\x80\x9cand nae doubt it\xc3\xads a decent thing to leave your wife to\r\nlook after young gentlemen\xc3\xads saddles and bridles, when ye gang to see a\r\nman, that never did ye nae ill, raxing a halter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, assuming an elevated tone, to which the\r\n_meridian_ had somewhat contributed, \xe2\x80\x9cdesist,--I say forbear, from\r\nintromitting with affairs thou canst not understand. D\xc3\xadye think I was\r\nborn to sit here brogging an elshin through bend-leather, when sic men as\r\nDuncan Forbes, and that other Arniston chield there, without muckle\r\ngreater parts, if the close-head speak true, than mysell maun be\r\npresidents and king\xc3\xads advocates, nae doubt, and wha but they? Whereas,\r\nwere favour equally distribute, as in the days of the wight Wallace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ken naething we wad hae gotten by the wight Wallace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nSaddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cunless, as I hae heard the auld folk tell, they fought in\r\nthae days wi\xc3\xad bend-leather guns, and then it\xc3\xads a chance but what, if he\r\nhad bought them, he might have forgot to pay for them. And as for the\r\ngreatness of your parts, Bartley, the folk in the close-head* maun ken\r\nmair about them than I do, if they make sic a report of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* [_Close-head,_ the entrance of a blind alley.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell ye, woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, in high dudgeon, \xe2\x80\x9cthat ye ken\r\nnaething about these matters. In Sir William Wallace\xc3\xads days there was nae\r\nman pinned down to sic a slavish wark as a saddler\xc3\xads, for they got ony\r\nleather graith that they had use for ready-made out of Holland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, who was, like many of his profession, something of a\r\nhumorist and dry joker, \xe2\x80\x9cif that be the case, Mr. Saddletree, I think we\r\nhave changed for the better; since we make our own harness, and only\r\nimport our lawyers from Holland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads ower true, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bartoline, with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x9cif I had\r\nhad the luck--or rather, if my father had had the sense to send me to\r\nLeyden and Utrecht to learn the Substitutes and Pandex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean the Institutes--Justinian\xc3\xads Institutes, Mr. Saddletree?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nButler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstitutes and substitutes are synonymous words, Mr. Butler, and used\r\nindifferently as such in deeds of tailzie, as you may see in Balfour\xc3\xads\r\nPractiques, or Dallas of St. Martin\xc3\xads Styles. I understand these things\r\npretty weel, I thank God but I own I should have studied in Holland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo comfort you, you might not have been farther forward than you are\r\nnow, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cfor our Scottish advocates are\r\nan aristocratic race. Their brass is of the right Corinthian quality, and\r\n_Non cuivis contigit adire Corinthum_--Aha, Mr. Saddletree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd aha, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Bartoline, upon whom, as may be well\r\nsupposed, the jest was lost, and all but the sound of the words, \xe2\x80\x9cye said\r\na gliff syne it was _quivis,_ and now I heard ye say _cuivis_ with my ain\r\nears, as plain as ever I heard a word at the fore-bar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your patience, Mr. Saddletree, and I\xc3\xadll explain the discrepancy\r\nin three words,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, as pedantic in his own department, though\r\nwith infinitely more judgment and learning, as Bartoline was in his\r\nself-assumed profession of the law--\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your patience for a\r\nmoment--You\xc3\xadll grant that the nominative case is that by which a person or\r\nthing is nominated or designed, and which may be called the primary case,\r\nall others being formed from it by alterations of the termination in the\r\nlearned languages, and by prepositions in our modern Babylonian\r\njargons--You\xc3\xadll grant me that, I suppose, Mr. Saddletree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken whether I will or no--_ad avisandum,_ ye ken--naebody should\r\nbe in a hurry to make admissions, either in point of law, or in point of\r\nfact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, looking, or endeavouring to look, as if he\r\nunderstood what was said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the dative case,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Butler\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ken what a tutor dative is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9creadily enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dative case,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the grammarian, \xe2\x80\x9cis that in which anything is\r\ngiven or assigned as properly belonging to a person or thing--You cannot\r\ndeny that, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I\xc3\xadll no grant it, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, what the _deevil_ d\xc3\xadye take the nominative and the dative cases to\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, hastily, and surprised at once out of his decency of\r\nexpression and accuracy of pronunciation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll tell you that at leisure, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, with a very\r\nknowing look; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll take a day to see and answer every article of your\r\ncondescendence, and then I\xc3\xadll hold you to confess or deny as accords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xc3\xadll hae nae confessions\r\nand condescendences here; let them deal in thae sort o\xc3\xad wares that are\r\npaid for them--they suit the like o\xc3\xad us as all as a demipique saddle\r\nwould suit a draught ox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Butler, \xe2\x80\x9c_Optat ephippia bos piger,_ nothing new under\r\nthe sun--But it was a fair hit of Mrs. Saddletree, however.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it wad far better become ye, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his\r\nhelpmate, \xe2\x80\x9csince ye say ye hae skeel o\xc3\xad the law, to try if ye can do\r\nonything for Effie Deans, puir thing, that\xc3\xads lying up in the tolbooth\r\nyonder, cauld, and hungry, and comfortless--A servant lass of ours, Mr.\r\nButler, and as innocent a lass, to my thinking, and as usefu\xc3\xad in the\r\nshop--When Mr. Saddletree gangs out,--and ye\xc3\xadre aware he\xc3\xads seldom at hame\r\nwhen there\xc3\xads ony o\xc3\xad the plea-houses open,--poor Effie used to help me to\r\ntumble the bundles o\xc3\xad barkened leather up and down, and range out the\r\ngudes, and suit a\xc3\xad body\xc3\xads humours--And troth, she could aye please the\r\ncustomers wi\xc3\xad her answers, for she was aye civil, and a bonnier lass\r\nwasna in Auld Reekie. And when folk were hasty and unreasonable, she\r\ncould serve them better than me, that am no sae young as I hae been, Mr.\r\nButler, and a wee bit short in the temper into the bargain. For when\r\nthere\xc3\xads ower mony folks crying on me at anes, and nane but ae tongue to\r\nanswer them, folk maun speak hastily, or they\xc3\xadll ne\xc3\xader get through their\r\nwark--Sae I miss Effie daily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_De die in diem,_\xe2\x80\x9d added Saddletree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, after a good deal of hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen the\r\ngirl in the shop--a modest-looking, fair-haired girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, that\xc3\xads just puir Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mistress. \xe2\x80\x9cHow she was\r\nabandoned to hersell, or whether she was sackless o\xc3\xad the sinful deed, God\r\nin Heaven knows; but if she\xc3\xads been guilty, she\xc3\xads been sair tempted, and I\r\nwad amaist take my Bible-aith she hasna been hersell at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler had by this time become much agitated; he fidgeted up and down the\r\nshop, and showed the greatest agitation that a person of such strict\r\ndecorum could be supposed to give way to. \xe2\x80\x9cWas not this girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe daughter of David Deans, that had the parks at St. Leonard\xc3\xads taken?\r\nand has she not a sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn troth has she,--puir Jeanie Deans, ten years aulder than hersell; she\r\nwas here greeting a wee while syne about her tittie. And what could I say\r\nto her, but that she behoved to come and speak to Mr. Saddletree when he\r\nwas at hame? It wasna that I thought Mr. Saddletree could do her or ony\r\nither body muckle good or ill, but it wad aye serve to keep the puir\r\nthing\xc3\xads heart up for a wee while; and let sorrow come when sorrow maun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xc3\xadre mistaen though, gudewife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree scornfully, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\r\ncould hae gien her great satisfaction; I could hae proved to her that her\r\nsister was indicted upon the statute saxteen hundred and ninety, chapter\r\none--For the mair ready prevention of child-murder--for concealing her\r\npregnancy, and giving no account of the child which she had borne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler,--\xe2\x80\x9cI trust in a gracious God, that she can clear\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd sae do I, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Saddletree. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I wad hae\r\nanswered for her as my ain daughter; but wae\xc3\xads my heart, I had been\r\ntender a\xc3\xad the simmer, and scarce ower the door o\xc3\xad my room for twal weeks.\r\nAnd as for Mr. Saddletree, he might be in a lying-in hospital, and ne\xc3\xader\r\nfind out what the women cam there for. Sae I could see little or naething\r\no\xc3\xad her, or I wad hae had the truth o\xc3\xad her situation out o\xc3\xad her, I\xc3\xadse\r\nwarrant ye--But we a\xc3\xad think her sister maun be able to speak something to\r\nclear her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe haill Parliament House,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cwas speaking o\xc3\xad naething\r\nelse, till this job o\xc3\xad Porteous\xc3\xads put it out o\xc3\xad head--It\xc3\xads a beautiful\r\npoint of presumptive murder, and there\xc3\xads been nane like it in the\r\nJusticiar Court since the case of Luckie Smith the howdie, that suffered\r\nin the year saxteen hundred and seventy-nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xc3\xads the matter wi\xc3\xad you, Mr. Butler?\xe2\x80\x9d said the good woman; \xe2\x80\x9cye are\r\nlooking as white as a sheet; will ye tak a dram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, compelling himself to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cI walked in\r\nfrom Dumfries yesterday, and this is a warm day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Saddletree, laying hands on him kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cand rest\r\nye--yell kill yoursell, man, at that rate.--And are we to wish you joy o\xc3\xad\r\ngetting the scule, Mr. Butler?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--no--I do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the young man vaguely. But Mrs.\r\nSaddletree kept him to point, partly out of real interest, partly from\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe dinna ken whether ye are to get the free scule o\xc3\xad Dumfries or no,\r\nafter hinging on and teaching it a\xc3\xad the simmer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mrs. Saddletree--I am not to have it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler, more\r\ncollectedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Laird of Black-at-the-Bane had a natural son bred to\r\nthe kirk, that the Presbytery could not be prevailed upon to license; and\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ye need say nae mair about it; if there was a laird that had a puir\r\nkinsman or a bastard that it wad suit, there\xc3\xads enough said.--And ye\xc3\xadre\r\ne\xc3\xaden come back to Liberton to wait for dead men\xc3\xads shoon?--and for as\r\nfrail as Mr. Whackbairn is, he may live as lang as you, that are his\r\nassistant and successor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery like,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler, with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know if I should wish\r\nit otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae doubt, it\xc3\xads a very vexing thing,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the good lady, \xe2\x80\x9cto be in\r\nthat dependent station; and you that hae right and title to sae muckle\r\nbetter, I wonder how ye bear these crosses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quos diligit castigat,_\xe2\x80\x9d answered Butler; \xe2\x80\x9ceven the pagan Seneca could\r\nsee an advantage in affliction, The Heathens had their philosophy, and\r\nthe Jews their revelation, Mrs. Saddletree, and they endured their\r\ndistresses in their day. Christians have a better dispensation than\r\neither--but doubtless--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped and sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ken what ye mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Saddletree, looking toward her husband;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads whiles we lose patience in spite of baith book and Bible--But ye\r\nare no gaun awa, and looking sae poorly--ye\xc3\xadll stay and take some kale\r\nwi\xc3\xad us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Saddletree laid aside Balfour\xc3\xads Practiques (his favourite study, and\r\nmuch good may it do him), to join in his wife\xc3\xads hospitable importunity.\r\nBut the teacher declined all entreaty, and took his leave upon the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xc3\xads something in a\xc3\xad this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Saddletree, looking after him\r\nas he walked up the street; \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what makes Mr. Butler sae\r\ndistressed about Effie\xc3\xads misfortune--there was nae acquaintance atween\r\nthem that ever I saw or heard of; but they were neighbours when David\r\nDeans was on the Laird o\xc3\xad Dumbiedikes\xc3\xad land. Mr. Butler wad ken her\r\nfather, or some o\xc3\xad her folk.--Get up, Mr. Saddletree--ye have set\r\nyoursell down on the very brecham that wants stitching--and here\xc3\xads little\r\nWillie, the prentice.--Ye little rin-there-out deil that ye are, what\r\ntakes you raking through the gutters to see folk hangit?--how wad ye like\r\nwhen it comes to be your ain chance, as I winna ensure ye, if ye dinna\r\nmend your manners?--And what are ye maundering and greeting for, as if a\r\nword were breaking your banes?--Gang in by, and be a better bairn another\r\ntime, and tell Peggy to gie ye a bicker o\xc3\xad broth, for ye\xc3\xadll be as gleg as\r\na gled, I\xc3\xadse warrant ye.--It\xc3\xads a fatherless bairn, Mr. Saddletree, and\r\nmotherless, whilk in some cases may be waur, and ane would take care o\xc3\xad\r\nhim if they could--it\xc3\xads a Christian duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, gudewife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are _in loco\r\nparentis_ to him during his years of pupillarity, and I hae had thoughts\r\nof applying to the Court for a commission as factor _loco tutoris,_\r\nseeing there is nae tutor nominate, and the tutor-at-law declines to act;\r\nbut only I fear the expense of the procedure wad not be _in rem versam,_\r\nfor I am not aware if Willie has ony effects whereof to assume the\r\nadministration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe concluded this sentence with a self-important cough, as one who has\r\nlaid down the law in an indisputable manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEffects!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat effects has the puir wean?--he was\r\nin rags when his mother died; and the blue polonie that Effie made for\r\nhim out of an auld mantle of my ain, was the first decent dress the bairn\r\never had on. Poor Effie! can ye tell me now really, wi\xc3\xad a\xc3\xad your law, will\r\nher life be in danger, Mr. Saddletree, when they arena able to prove that\r\never there was a bairn ava?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Saddletree, delighted at having for once in his life\r\nseen his wife\xc3\xads attention arrested by a topic of legal discussion--\xe2\x80\x9cWhoy,\r\nthere are two sorts of _murdrum_ or _murdragium,_ or what you\r\n_populariter et vulgariser_ call murther. I mean there are many sorts;\r\nfor there\xc3\xads your _murthrum per vigilias et insidias,_ and your _murthrum_\r\nunder trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his moiety, \xe2\x80\x9cthat murther by trust is the way that\r\nthe gentry murther us merchants, and whiles make us shut the booth\r\nup--but that has naething to do wi\xc3\xad Effie\xc3\xads misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe case of Effie (or Euphemia) Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cis one of\r\nthose cases of murder presumptive, that is, a murder of the law\xc3\xads\r\ninferring or construction, being derived from certain _indicia_ or\r\ngrounds of suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good woman, \xe2\x80\x9cunless poor Effie has communicated her\r\nsituation, she\xc3\xadll be hanged by the neck, if the bairn was still-born, or\r\nif it be alive at this moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cit being a statute made by our Sovereign\r\nLord and Lady, to prevent the horrid delict of bringing forth children in\r\nsecret--The crime is rather a favourite of the law, this species of\r\nmurther being one of its ain creation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if the law makes murders,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cthe law should\r\nbe hanged for them; or if they wad hang a lawyer instead, the country wad\r\nfind nae faut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA summons to their frugal dinner interrupted the farther progress of the\r\nconversation, which was otherwise like to take a turn much less\r\nfavourable to the science of jurisprudence and its professors, than Mr.\r\nBartoline Saddletree, the fond admirer of both, had at its opening\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   But up then raise all Edinburgh.\r\n                   They all rose up by thousands three.\r\n                                      Johnnie Armstrang\xc3\xads _Goodnight._\r\n\r\nButler, on his departure from the sign of the Golden Nag, went in quest\r\nof a friend of his connected with the law, of whom he wished to make\r\nparticular inquiries concerning the circumstances in which the\r\nunfortunate young woman mentioned in the last chapter was placed, having,\r\nas the reader has probably already conjectured, reasons much deeper than\r\nthose dictated by mere humanity for interesting himself in her fate. He\r\nfound the person he sought absent from home, and was equally unfortunate\r\nin one or two other calls which he made upon acquaintances whom he hoped\r\nto interest in her story. But everybody was, for the moment, stark-mad on\r\nthe subject of Porteous, and engaged busily in attacking or defending the\r\nmeasures of Government in reprieving him; and the ardour of dispute had\r\nexcited such universal thirst, that half the young lawyers and writers,\r\ntogether with their very clerks, the class whom Butler was looking after,\r\nhad adjourned the debate to some favourite tavern. It was computed by an\r\nexperienced arithmetician, that there was as much twopenny ale consumed\r\non the discussion as would have floated a first-rate man-of-war.\r\n\r\nButler wandered about until it was dusk, resolving to take that\r\nopportunity of visiting the unfortunate young woman, when his doing so\r\nmight be least observed; for he had his own reasons for avoiding the\r\nremarks of Mrs. Saddletree, whose shop-door opened at no great distance\r\nfrom that of the jail, though on the opposite or south side of the\r\nstreet, and a little higher up. He passed, therefore, through the narrow\r\nand partly covered passage leading from the north-west end of the\r\nParliament Square.\r\n\r\nHe stood now before the Gothic entrance of the ancient prison, which, as\r\nis well known to all men, rears its ancient front in the very middle of\r\nthe High Street, forming, as it were, the termination to a huge pile of\r\nbuildings called the Luckenbooths, which, for some inconceivable reason,\r\nour ancestors had jammed into the midst of the principal street of the\r\ntown, leaving for passage a narrow street on the north; and on the south,\r\ninto which the prison opens, a narrow crooked lane, winding betwixt the\r\nhigh and sombre walls of the Tolbooth and the adjacent houses on the one\r\nside, and the butresses and projections of the old Cathedral upon the\r\nother. To give some gaiety to this sombre passage (well known by the name\r\nof the Krames), a number of little booths, or shops, after the fashion of\r\ncobblers\xc3\xad stalls, are plastered, as it were, against the Gothic\r\nprojections and abutments, so that it seemed as if the traders had\r\noccupied with nests, bearing the same proportion to the building, every\r\nbuttress and coign of vantage, as the martlett did in Macbeth\xc3\xads Castle.\r\nOf later years these booths have degenerated into mere toy-shops, where\r\nthe little loiterers chiefly interested in such wares are tempted to\r\nlinger, enchanted by the rich display of hobby-horses, babies, and Dutch\r\ntoys, arranged in artful and gay confusion; yet half-scared by the cross\r\nlooks of the withered pantaloon, or spectacled old lady, by whom these\r\ntempting stores are watched and superintended. But, in the times we write\r\nof, the hosiers, the glovers, the hatters, the mercers, the milliners,\r\nand all who dealt in the miscellaneous wares now termed haberdasher\xc3\xads\r\ngoods, were to be found in this narrow alley.\r\n\r\nTo return from our digression. Butler found the outer turnkey, a tall\r\nthin old man, with long silver hair, in the act of locking the outward\r\ndoor of the jail. He addressed himself to this person, and asked\r\nadmittance to Effie Deans, confined upon accusation of child-murder. The\r\nturnkey looked at him earnestly, and, civilly touching his hat out of\r\nrespect to Butler\xc3\xads black coat and clerical appearance, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nimpossible any one could be admitted at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shut up earlier than usual, probably on account of Captain\r\nPorteous\xc3\xads affair?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler.\r\n\r\nThe turnkey, with the true mystery of a person in office, gave two grave\r\nnods, and withdrawing from the wards a ponderous key of about two feet in\r\nlength, he proceeded to shut a strong plate of steel, which folded down\r\nabove the keyhole, and was secured by a steel spring and catch. Butler\r\nstood still instinctively while the door was made fast, and then looking\r\nat his watch, walked briskly up the street, muttering to himself, almost\r\nunconsciously--\r\n\r\n               Porta adversa, ingens, solidoque adamante columnae;\r\n               Vis ut nulla virum, non ipsi exscindere ferro\r\n               Coelicolae valeant--Stat ferrea turris ad auras--etc.*\r\n                                        Dryden\xc3\xads _Virgil,_ Book vi.\r\n\r\n* Wide is the fronting gate, and, raised on high, With adamantine columns\r\nthreats the sky; Vain is the force of man, and Heaven\xc3\xads as vain, To crush\r\nthe pillars which the pile sustain: Sublime on these a tower of steel is\r\nreard.\r\n\r\nHaving wasted half-an-hour more in a second fruitless attempt to find his\r\nlegal friend and adviser, he thought it time to leave the city and return\r\nto his place of residence, in a small village about two miles and a half\r\nto the southward of Edinburgh. The metropolis was at this time surrounded\r\nby a high wall, with battlements and flanking projections at some\r\nintervals, and the access was through gates, called in the Scottish\r\nlanguage _ports,_ which were regularly shut at night. A small fee to the\r\nkeepers would indeed procure egress and ingress at any time, through a\r\nwicket left for that purpose in the large gate; but it was of some\r\nimportance, to a man so poor as Butler, to avoid even this slight\r\npecuniary mulct; and fearing the hour of shutting the gates might be\r\nnear, he made for that to which he found himself nearest, although, by\r\ndoing so, he somewhat lengthened his walk homewards. Bristo Port was that\r\nby which his direct road lay, but the West Port, which leads out of the\r\nGrassmarket, was the nearest of the city gates to the place where he\r\nfound himself, and to that, therefore, he directed his course. He reached\r\nthe port in ample time to pass the circuit of the walls, and entered a\r\nsuburb called Portsburgh, chiefly inhabited by the lower order of\r\ncitizens and mechanics. Here he was unexpectedly interrupted.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far from the gate before he heard the sound of a drum,\r\nand, to his great surprise, met a number of persons, sufficient to occupy\r\nthe whole front of the street, and form a considerable mass behind,\r\nmoving with great speed towards the gate he had just come from, and\r\nhaving in front of them a drum beating to arms. While he considered how\r\nhe should escape a party, assembled, as it might be presumed, for no\r\nlawful purpose, they came full on him and stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a clergyman?\xe2\x80\x9d one questioned him.\r\n\r\nButler replied that \xe2\x80\x9che was in orders, but was not a placed minister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads Mr. Butler from Liberton,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice from behind, \xe2\x80\x9che\xc3\xadll\r\ndischarge the duty as weel as ony man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must turn back with us, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first speaker, in a tone\r\ncivil but peremptory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what purpose, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cI live at some distance\r\nfrom town--the roads are unsafe by night--you will do me a serious injury\r\nby stopping me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be sent safely home--no man shall touch a hair of your\r\nhead--but you must and shall come along with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to what purpose or end, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will be\r\nso civil as to explain that to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know that in good time. Come along--for come you must, by\r\nforce or fair means; and I warn you to look neither to the right hand nor\r\nthe left, and to take no notice of any man\xc3\xads face, but consider all that\r\nis passing before you as a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would it were a dream I could awaken from,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler to himself;\r\nbut having no means to oppose the violence with which he was threatened,\r\nhe was compelled to turn round and march in front of the rioters, two men\r\npartly supporting and partly holding him. During this parley the\r\ninsurgents had made themselves masters of the West Port, rushing upon the\r\nWaiters (so the people were called who had the charge of the gates), and\r\npossessing themselves of the keys. They bolted and barred the folding\r\ndoors, and commanded the person, whose duty it usually was, to secure the\r\nwicket, of which they did not understand the fastenings. The man,\r\nterrified at an incident so totally unexpected, was unable to perform his\r\nusual office, and gave the matter up, after several attempts. The\r\nrioters, who seemed to have come prepared for every emergency, called for\r\ntorches, by the light of which they nailed up the wicket with long nails,\r\nwhich, it seemed probable, they had provided on purpose.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, Butler could not, even if he had been willing,\r\navoid making remarks on the individuals who seemed to lead this singular\r\nmob. The torch-light, while it fell on their forms and left him in the\r\nshade, gave him an opportunity to do so without their observing him.\r\nSeveral of those who seemed most active were dressed in sailors\xc3\xad jackets,\r\ntrousers, and sea-caps; others in large loose-bodied greatcoats, and\r\nslouched hats; and there were several who, judging from their dress,\r\nshould have been called women, whose rough deep voices, uncommon size,\r\nand masculine, deportment and mode of walking, forbade them being so\r\ninterpreted. They moved as if by some well-concerted plan of arrangement.\r\nThey had signals by which they knew, and nicknames by which they\r\ndistinguished each other. Butler remarked, that the name of Wildfire was\r\nused among them, to which one stout Amazon seemed to reply.\r\n\r\nThe rioters left a small party to observe the West Port, and directed the\r\nWaiters, as they valued their lives, to remain within their lodge, and\r\nmake no attempt for that night to repossess themselves of the gate. They\r\nthen moved with rapidity along the low street called the Cowgate, the mob\r\nof the city everywhere rising at the sound of their drum, and joining\r\nthem. When the multitude arrived at the Cowgate Port, they secured it\r\nwith as little opposition as the former, made it fast, and left a small\r\nparty to observe it. It was afterwards remarked, as a striking instance\r\nof prudence and precaution, singularly combined with audacity, that the\r\nparties left to guard those gates did not remain stationary on their\r\nposts, but flitted to and fro, keeping so near the gates as to see that\r\nno efforts were made to open them, yet not remaining so long as to have\r\ntheir persons closely observed. The mob, at first only about one hundred\r\nstrong, now amounted to thousands, and were increasing every moment. They\r\ndivided themselves so as to ascend with more speed the various narrow\r\nlanes which lead up from the Cowgate to the High Street; and still\r\nbeating to arms as they went, an calling on all true Scotsmen to join\r\nthem, they now filled the principal street of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Netherbow Port might be called the Temple Bar of Edinburgh, as,\r\nintersecting the High Street at its termination, it divided Edinburgh,\r\nproperly so called, from the suburb named the Canongate, as Temple Bar\r\nseparates London from Westminster. It was of the utmost importance to the\r\nrioters to possess themselves of this pass, because there was quartered\r\nin the Canongate at that time a regiment of infantry, commanded by\r\nColonel Moyle, which might have occupied the city by advancing through\r\nthis gate, and would possess the power of totally defeating their\r\npurpose. The leaders therefore hastened to the Netherbow Port, which they\r\nsecured in the same manner, and with as little trouble, as the other\r\ngates, leaving a party to watch it, strong in proportion to the\r\nimportance of the post.\r\n\r\nThe next object of these hardy insurgents was at once to disarm the City\r\nGuard, and to procure arms for themselves; for scarce any weapons but\r\nstaves and bludgeons had been yet seen among them. The Guard-house was a\r\nlong, low, ugly building (removed in 1787), which to a fanciful\r\nimagination might have suggested the idea of a long black snail crawling\r\nup the middle of the High Street, and deforming its beautiful esplanade.\r\nThis formidable insurrection had been so unexpected, that there were no\r\nmore than the ordinary sergeant\xc3\xads guard of the city-corps upon duty; even\r\nthese were without any supply of powder and ball; and sensible enough\r\nwhat had raised the storm, and which way it was rolling, could hardly be\r\nsupposed very desirous to expose themselves by a valiant defence to the\r\nanimosity of so numerous and desperate a mob, to whom they were on the\r\npresent occasion much more than usually obnoxious.\r\n\r\nThere was a sentinel upon guard, who (that one town-guard soldier might\r\ndo his duty on that eventful evening) presented his piece, and desired\r\nthe foremost of the rioters to stand off. The young Amazon, whom Butler\r\nhad observed particularly active, sprung upon the soldier, seized his\r\nmusket, and after a struggle succeeded in wrenching it from him, and\r\nthrowing him down on the causeway. One or two soldiers, who endeavoured\r\nto turn out to the support of their sentinel, were in the same manner\r\nseized and disarmed, and the mob without difficulty possessed themselves\r\nof the Guard-house, disarming and turning out of doors the rest of the\r\nmen on duty. It was remarked, that, notwithstanding the city soldiers had\r\nbeen the instruments of the slaughter which this riot was designed to\r\nrevenge, no ill usage or even insult was offered to them. It seemed as if\r\nthe vengeance of the people disdained to stoop at any head meaner than\r\nthat which they considered as the source and origin of their injuries.\r\n\r\nOn possessing themselves of the guard, the first act of the multitude was\r\nto destroy the drums, by which they supposed an alarm might be conveyed\r\nto the garrison in the castle; for the same reason they now silenced\r\ntheir own, which was beaten by a young fellow, son to the drummer of\r\nPortsburgh, whom they had forced upon that service. Their next business\r\nwas to distribute among the boldest of the rioters the guns, bayonets,\r\npartisans, halberts, and battle or Lochaber axes. Until this period the\r\nprincipal rioters had preserved silence on the ultimate object of their\r\nrising, as being that which all knew, but none expressed. Now, however,\r\nhaving accomplished all the preliminary parts of their design, they\r\nraised a tremendous shout of \xe2\x80\x9cPorteous! Porteous! To the Tolbooth! To the\r\nTolbooth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tolbooth, Cannongate]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey proceeded with the same prudence when the object seemed to be nearly\r\nin their grasp, as they had done hitherto when success was more dubious.\r\nA strong party of the rioters, drawn up in front of the Luckenbooths, and\r\nfacing down the street, prevented all access from the eastward, and the\r\nwest end of the defile formed by the Luckenbooths was secured in the same\r\nmanner; so that the Tolbooth was completely surrounded, and those who\r\nundertook the task of breaking it open effectually secured against the\r\nrisk of interruption.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates, in the meanwhile, had taken the alarm, and assembled in\r\na tavern, with the purpose of raising some strength to subdue the\r\nrioters. The deacons, or presidents of the trades, were applied to, but\r\ndeclared there was little chance of their authority being respected by\r\nthe craftsmen, where it was the object to save a man so obnoxious. Mr.\r\nLindsay, member of parliament for the city, volunteered the perilous task\r\nof carrying a verbal message, from the Lord Provost to Colonel Moyle, the\r\ncommander of the regiment lying in the Canongate, requesting him to force\r\nthe Netherbow Port, and enter the city to put down the tumult. But Mr.\r\nLindsay declined to charge himself with any written order, which, if\r\nfound on his person by an enraged mob, might have cost him his life; and\r\nthe issue, of the application was, that Colonel Moyle having no written\r\nrequisition from the civil authorities, and having the fate of Porteous\r\nbefore his eyes as an example of the severe construction put by a jury on\r\nthe proceedings of military men acting on their own responsibility,\r\ndeclined to encounter the risk to which the Provost\xc3\xads verbal\r\ncommunication invited him.\r\n\r\nMore than one messenger was despatched by different ways to the Castle,\r\nto require the commanding officer to march down his troops, to fire a few\r\ncannon-shot, or even to throw a shell among the mob, for the purpose of\r\nclearing the streets. But so strict and watchful were the various patrols\r\nwhom the rioters had established in different parts of the streets, that\r\nnone of the emissaries of the magistrates could reach the gate of the\r\nCastle. They were, however, turned back without either injury or insult,\r\nand with nothing more of menace than was necessary to deter them from\r\nagain attempting to accomplish their errand.\r\n\r\nThe same vigilance was used to prevent everybody of the higher, and those\r\nwhich, in this case, might be deemed the more suspicious orders of\r\nsociety, from appearing in the street, and observing the movements, or\r\ndistinguishing the persons, of the rioters. Every person in the garb of a\r\ngentleman was stopped by small parties of two or three of the mob, who\r\npartly exhorted, partly required of them, that they should return to the\r\nplace from whence they came. Many a quadrille table was spoilt that\r\nmemorable evening; for the sedan chairs of ladies; even of the highest\r\nrank, were interrupted in their passage from one point to another, in\r\nspite of the laced footmen and blazing flambeaux. This was uniformly done\r\nwith a deference and attention to the feelings of the terrified females,\r\nwhich could hardly have been expected from the videttes of a mob so\r\ndesperate. Those who stopped the chair usually made the excuse, that\r\nthere was much disturbance on the streets, and that it was absolutely\r\nnecessary for the lady\xc3\xads safety that the chair should turn back. They\r\noffered themselves to escort the vehicles which they had thus interrupted\r\nin their progress, from the apprehension, probably, that some of those\r\nwho had casually united themselves to the riot might disgrace their\r\nsystematic and determined plan of vengeance, by those acts of general\r\ninsult and license which are common on similar occasions.\r\n\r\nPersons are yet living who remember to have heard from the mouths of\r\nladies thus interrupted on their journey in the manner we have described,\r\nthat they were escorted to their lodgings by the young men who stopped\r\nthem, and even handed out of their chairs, with a polite attention far\r\nbeyond what was consistent with their dress, which was apparently that of\r\njourneymen mechanics.*\r\n\r\n* A near relation of the author\xc3\xads used to tell of having been stopped by\r\nthe rioters, and escorted home in the manner described. On reaching her\r\nown home one of her attendants, in the appearance a _baxter_, a baker\xc3\xads\r\nlad, handed her out of her chair, and took leave with a bow, which, in\r\nthe lady\xc3\xads opinion, argued breeding that could hardly be learned at the\r\noven\xc3\xads mouth.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the conspirators, like those who assassinated Cardinal\r\nBeatoun in former days, had entertained the opinion, that the work about\r\nwhich they went was a judgment of Heaven, which, though unsanctioned by\r\nthe usual authorities, ought to be proceeded in with order and gravity.\r\n\r\nWhile their outposts continued thus vigilant, and suffered themselves\r\nneither from fear nor curiosity to neglect that part of the duty assigned\r\nto them, and while the main guards to the east and west secured them\r\nagainst interruption, a select body of the rioters thundered at the door\r\nof the jail, and demanded instant admission. No one answered, for the\r\nouter keeper had prudently made his escape with the keys at the\r\ncommencement of the riot, and was nowhere to be found. The door was\r\ninstantly assailed with sledge-hammers, iron crows, and the coulters of\r\nploughs, ready provided for the purpose, with which they prized, heaved,\r\nand battered for some time with little effect; for the door, besides\r\nbeing of double oak planks, clenched, both endlong and athwart, with\r\nbroad-headed nails, was so hung and secured as to yield to no means of\r\nforcing, without the expenditure of much time. The rioters, however,\r\nappeared determined to gain admittance. Gang after gang relieved each\r\nother at the exercise, for, of course, only a few could work at once; but\r\ngang after gang retired, exhausted with their violent exertions, without\r\nmaking much progress in forcing the prison door. Butler had been led up\r\nnear to this the principal scene of action; so near, indeed, that he was\r\nalmost deafened by the unceasing clang of the heavy fore-hammers against\r\nthe iron-bound portal of the prison. He began to entertain hopes, as the\r\ntask seemed protracted, that the populace might give it over in despair,\r\nor that some rescue might arrive to disperse them. There was a moment at\r\nwhich the latter seemed probable.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates, having assembled their officers, and some of the\r\ncitizens who were willing to hazard themselves for the public\r\ntranquillity, now sallied forth from the tavern where they held their\r\nsitting, and approached the point of danger. Their officers went before\r\nthem with links and torches, with a herald to read the riot-act, if\r\nnecessary. They easily drove before them the outposts and videttes of the\r\nrioters; but when they approached the line of guard which the mob, or\r\nrather, we should say, the conspirators, had drawn across the street in\r\nthe front of the Luckenbooths, they were received with an unintermitted\r\nvolley of stones, and, on their nearer approach, the pikes, bayonets, and\r\nLochaber-axes, of which the populace had possessed themselves, were\r\npresented against them. One of their ordinary officers, a strong resolute\r\nfellow, went forward, seized a rioter, and took from him a musket; but,\r\nbeing unsupported, he was instantly thrown on his back in the street, and\r\ndisarmed in his turn. The officer was too happy to be permitted to rise\r\nand run away without receiving any farther injury; which afforded another\r\nremarkable instance of the mode in which these men had united a sort of\r\nmoderation towards all others, with the most inflexible inveteracy\r\nagainst the object of their resentment. The magistrates, after vain\r\nattempts to make themselves heard and obeyed, possessing no means of\r\nenforcing their authority, were constrained to abandon the field to the\r\nrioters, and retreat in all speed from the showers of missiles that\r\nwhistled around their ears.\r\n\r\nThe passive resistance of the Tolbooth gate promised to do more to baffle\r\nthe purpose of the mob than the active interference of the magistrates.\r\nThe heavy sledge-hammers continued to din against it without\r\nintermission, and with a noise which, echoed from the lofty buildings\r\naround the spot, seemed enough to have alarmed the garrison in the\r\nCastle. It was circulated among the rioters, that the troops would march\r\ndown to disperse them, unless they could execute their purpose without\r\nloss of time; or that, even without quitting the fortress, the garrison\r\nmight obtain the same end by throwing a bomb or two upon the street.\r\n\r\nUrged by such motives for apprehension, they eagerly relieved each other\r\nat the labour of assailing the Tolbooth door: yet such was its strength,\r\nthat it still defied their efforts. At length, a voice was heard to\r\npronounce the words, \xe2\x80\x9cTry it with fire.\xe2\x80\x9d The rioters, with an unanimous\r\nshout, called for combustibles, and as all their wishes seemed to be\r\ninstantly supplied, they were soon in possession of two or three empty\r\ntar-barrels. A huge red glaring bonfire speedily arose close to the door\r\nof the prison, sending up a tall column of smoke and flame against its\r\nantique turrets and strongly-grated windows, and illuminating the\r\nferocious and wild gestures of the rioters, who surrounded the place, as\r\nwell as the pale and anxious groups of those, who, from windows in the\r\nvicinage, watched the progress of this alarming scene. The mob fed the\r\nfire with whatever they could find fit for the purpose. The flames roared\r\nand crackled among the heaps of nourishment piled on the fire, and a\r\nterrible shout soon announced that the door had kindled, and was in the\r\nact of being destroyed. The fire was suffered to decay, but, long ere it\r\nwas quite extinguished, the most forward of the rioters rushed, in their\r\nimpatience, one after another, over its yet smouldering remains. Thick\r\nshowers of sparkles rose high in the air, as man after man bounded over\r\nthe glowing embers, and disturbed them in their passage. It was now\r\nobvious to Butler, and all others who were present, that the rioters\r\nwould be instantly in possession of their victim, and have it in their\r\npower to work their pleasure upon him, whatever that might be.*\r\n\r\n* Note C. The Old Tolbooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The evil you teach us,\r\n          We will execute; and it shall go hard, but we will\r\n                        Better the instruction.\r\n                                               Merchant of Venice.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy object of this remarkable disturbance had been that day\r\ndelivered from the apprehension of public execution, and his joy was the\r\ngreater, as he had some reason to question whether Government would have\r\nrun the risk of unpopularity by interfering in his favour, after he had\r\nbeen legally convicted by the verdict of a jury, of a crime so very\r\nobnoxious. Relieved from this doubtful state of mind, his heart was merry\r\nwithin him, and he thought, in the emphatic words of Scripture on a\r\nsimilar occasion, that surely the bitterness of death was past. Some of\r\nhis friends, however, who had watched the manner and behaviour of the\r\ncrowd when they were made acquainted with the reprieve, were of a\r\ndifferent opinion. They augured, from the unusual sternness and silence\r\nwith which they bore their disappointment, that the populace nourished\r\nsome scheme of sudden and desperate vengeance; and they advised Porteous\r\nto lose no time in petitioning the proper authorities, that he might be\r\nconveyed to the Castle under a sufficient guard, to remain there in\r\nsecurity until his ultimate fate should be determined. Habituated,\r\nhowever, by his office, to overawe the rabble of the city, Porteous could\r\nnot suspect them of an attempt so audacious as to storm a strong and\r\ndefensible prison; and, despising the advice by which he might have been\r\nsaved, he spent the afternoon of the eventful day in giving an\r\nentertainment to some friends who visited him in jail, several of whom,\r\nby the indulgence of the Captain of the Tolbooth, with whom he had an old\r\nintimacy, arising from their official connection, were even permitted to\r\nremain to supper with him, though contrary to the rules of the jail.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, in the hour of unalloyed mirth, when this unfortunate\r\nwretch was \xe2\x80\x9cfull of bread,\xe2\x80\x9d hot with wine, and high in mistimed and\r\nill-grounded confidence, and alas! with all his sins full blown, when the\r\nfirst distant\xc3\xad shouts of the rioters mingled with the song of merriment\r\nand intemperance. The hurried call of the jailor to the guests, requiring\r\nthem instantly to depart, and his yet more hasty intimation that a\r\ndreadful and determined mob had possessed themselves of the city gates\r\nand guard-house, were the first explanation of these fearful clamours.\r\n\r\nPorteous might, however, have eluded the fury from which the force of\r\nauthority could not protect him, had he thought of slipping on some\r\ndisguise, and leaving the prison along with his guests. It is probable\r\nthat the jailor might have connived at his escape, or even that in the\r\nhurry of this alarming contingency, he might not have observed it. But\r\nPorteous and his friends alike wanted presence of mind to suggest or\r\nexecute such a plan of escape. The former hastily fled from a place where\r\ntheir own safety seemed compromised, and the latter, in a state\r\nresembling stupefaction, awaited in his apartment the termination of the\r\nenterprise of the rioters. The cessation of the clang of the instruments\r\nwith which they had at first attempted to force the door, gave him\r\nmomentary relief. The flattering hopes, that the military had marched\r\ninto the city, either from the Castle or from the suburbs, and that the\r\nrioters were intimidated, and dispersing, were soon destroyed by the\r\nbroad and glaring light of the flames, which, illuminating through the\r\ngrated window every corner of his apartment, plainly showed that the mob,\r\ndetermined on their fatal purpose, had adopted a means of forcing\r\nentrance equally desperate and certain.\r\n\r\nThe sudden glare of light suggested to the stupified and astonished\r\nobject of popular hatred the possibility of concealment or escape. To\r\nrush to the chimney, to ascend it at the risk of suffocation, were the\r\nonly means which seemed to have occurred to him; but his progress was\r\nspeedily stopped by one of those iron gratings, which are, for the sake\r\nof security, usually placed across the vents of buildings designed for\r\nimprisonment. The bars, however, which impeded his farther progress,\r\nserved to support him in the situation which he had gained, and he seized\r\nthem with the tenacious grasp of one who esteemed himself clinging to his\r\nlast hope of existence. The lurid light which had filled the apartment,\r\nlowered and died away; the sound of shouts was heard within the walls,\r\nand on the narrow and winding stair, which, eased within one of the\r\nturrets, gave access to the upper apartments of the prison. The huzza of\r\nthe rioters was answered by a shout wild and desperate as their own, the\r\ncry, namely, of the imprisoned felons, who, expecting to be liberated in\r\nthe general confusion, welcomed the mob as their deliverers. By some of\r\nthese the apartment of Porteous was pointed out to his enemies. The\r\nobstacle of the lock and bolts was soon overcome, and from his hiding\r\nplace the unfortunate man heard his enemies search every corner of the\r\napartment, with oaths and maledictions, which would but shock the reader\r\nif we recorded them, but which served to prove, could it have admitted of\r\ndoubt, the settled purpose of soul with which they sought his\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nA place of concealment so obvious to suspicion and scrutiny as that which\r\nPorteous had chosen, could not long screen him from detection. He was\r\ndragged from his lurking-place, with a violence which seemed to argue an\r\nintention to put him to death on the spot. More than one weapon was\r\ndirected towards him, when one of the rioters, the same whose female\r\ndisguise had been particularly noticed by Butler, interfered in an\r\nauthoritative tone. \xe2\x80\x9cAre ye mad?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cor would ye execute an act of\r\njustice as if it were a crime and a cruelty? This sacrifice will lose\r\nhalf its savour if we do not offer it at the very horns of the altar. We\r\nwill have him die where a murderer should die, on the common gibbet--We\r\nwill have him die where he spilled the blood of so many innocents!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA loud shout of applause followed the proposal, and the cry, \xe2\x80\x9cTo the\r\ngallows with the murderer!--to the Grassmarket with him!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed on all\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet no man hurt him,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the speaker; \xe2\x80\x9clet him make his peace\r\nwith God, if he can; we will not kill both his soul and body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time did he give better folk for preparing their account?\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nseveral voices. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us mete to him with the same measure he measured to\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the opinion of the spokesman better suited the temper of those he\r\naddressed, a temper rather stubborn than impetuous, sedate though\r\nferocious, and desirous of colouring their cruel and revengeful action\r\nwith a show of justice and moderation.\r\n\r\nFor an instant this man quitted the prisoner, whom he consigned to a\r\nselected guard, with instructions to permit him to give his money and\r\nproperty to whomsoever he pleased. A person confined in the jail for debt\r\nreceived this last deposit from the trembling hand of the victim, who was\r\nat the same time permitted to make some other brief arrangements to meet\r\nhis approaching fate. The felons, and all others who, wished to leave the\r\njail, were now at full liberty to do so; not that their liberation made\r\nany part of the settled purpose of the rioters, but it followed as almost\r\na necessary consequence of forcing the jail doors. With wild cries of\r\njubilee they joined the mob, or disappeared among the narrow lanes to\r\nseek out the hidden receptacles of vice and infamy, where they were\r\naccustomed to lurk and conceal themselves from justice.\r\n\r\nTwo persons, a man about fifty years old and a girl about eighteen, were\r\nall who continued within the fatal walls, excepting two or three debtors,\r\nwho probably saw no advantage in attempting their escape. The persons we\r\nhave mentioned remained in the strong room of the prison, now deserted by\r\nall others. One of their late companions in misfortune called out to the\r\nman to make his escape, in the tone of an acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x9cRin for it,\r\nRatcliffe--the road\xc3\xads clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be sae, Willie,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ratcliffe, composedly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have taen\r\na fancy to leave aff trade, and set up for an honest man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay there, and be hanged, then, for a donnard auld deevil!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nother, and ran down the prison stair.\r\n\r\nThe person in female attire whom we have distinguished as one of the most\r\nactive rioters, was about the same time at the ear of the young woman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlee, Effie, flee!\xe2\x80\x9d was all he had time to whisper. She turned towards\r\nhim an eye of mingled fear, affection, and upbraiding, all contending\r\nwith a sort of stupified surprise. He again repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cFlee, Effie, flee!\r\nfor the sake of all that\xc3\xads good and dear to you!\xe2\x80\x9d Again she gazed on him,\r\nbut was unable to answer. A loud noise was now heard, and the name of\r\nMadge Wildfire was repeatedly called from the bottom of the staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am coming,--I am coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said the person who answered to that\r\nappellative; and then reiterating hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xc3\xads sake--for your own\r\nsake--for my sake, flee, or they\xc3\xadll take your life!\xe2\x80\x9d he left the strong\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe girl gazed after him for a moment, and then, faintly muttering,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter tyne life, since tint is gude fame,\xe2\x80\x9d she sunk her head upon her\r\nhand, and remained, seemingly, unconscious as a statue of the noise and\r\ntumult which passed around her.\r\n\r\nThat tumult was now transferred from the inside to the outside of the\r\nTolbooth. The mob had brought their destined victim forth, and were about\r\nto conduct him to the common place of execution, which they had fixed as\r\nthe scene of his death. The leader, whom they distinguished by the name\r\nof Madge Wildfire, had been summoned to assist at the procession by the\r\nimpatient shouts of his confederates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will insure you five hundred pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unhappy man, grasping\r\nWildfire\xc3\xads hand,--\xe2\x80\x9cfive hundred pounds for to save my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other answered in the same undertone, and returning his grasp with\r\none equally convulsive, \xe2\x80\x9cFive hundredweight of coined gold should not\r\nsave you.--Remember Wilson!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep pause of a minute ensued, when Wildfire added, in a more composed\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cMake your peace with Heaven.--Where is the clergyman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler, who in great terror and anxiety, had been detained within a few\r\nyards of the Tolbooth door, to wait the event of the search after\r\nPorteous, was now brought forward, and commanded to walk by the\r\nprisoner\xc3\xads side, and to prepare him for immediate death. His answer was a\r\nsupplication that the rioters would consider what they did. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nneither judges nor jury,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot have, by the laws of God\r\nor man, power to take away the life of a human creature, however\r\ndeserving he may be of death. If it is murder even in a lawful magistrate\r\nto execute an offender otherwise than in the place, time, and manner\r\nwhich the judges\xc3\xad sentence prescribes, what must it be in you, who have\r\nno warrant for interference but your own wills? In the name of Him who is\r\nall mercy, show mercy to this unhappy man, and do not dip your hands in\r\nhis blood, nor rush into the very crime which you are desirous of\r\navenging!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut your sermon short--you are not in your pulpit,\xe2\x80\x9d answered one of the\r\nrioters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we hear more of your clavers,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are like to hang you\r\nup beside him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace--hush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wildfire. \xe2\x80\x9cDo the good man no harm--he discharges his\r\nconscience, and I like him the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then addressed Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, we have patiently heard you, and we\r\njust wish you to understand, in the way of answer, that you may as well\r\nargue to the ashlar-work and iron stanchels of the Tolbooth as think to\r\nchange our purpose--Blood must have blood. We have sworn to each other by\r\nthe deepest oaths ever were pledged, that Porteous shall die the death he\r\ndeserves so richly; therefore, speak no more to us, but prepare him for\r\ndeath as well as the briefness of his change will permit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had suffered the unfortunate Porteous to put on his night-gown and\r\nslippers, as he had thrown off his coat and shoes, in order to facilitate\r\nhis attempted escape up the chimney. In this garb he was now mounted on\r\nthe hands of two of the rioters, clasped together, so as to form what is\r\ncalled in Scotland, \xe2\x80\x9cThe King\xc3\xads Cushion.\xe2\x80\x9d Butler was placed close to his\r\nside, and repeatedly urged to perform a duty always the most painful\r\nwhich can be imposed on a clergyman deserving of the name, and now\r\nrendered more so by the peculiar and horrid circumstances of the\r\ncriminal\xc3\xads case. Porteous at first uttered some supplications for mercy,\r\nbut when he found that there was no chance that these would be attended\r\nto, his military education, and the natural stubbornness of his\r\ndisposition, combined to support his spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you prepared for this dreadful end?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, in a faltering\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cO turn to Him, in whose eyes time and space have no existence,\r\nand to whom a few minutes are as a lifetime, and a lifetime as a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I know what you would say,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Porteous sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nbred a soldier; if they will murder me without time, let my sins as well\r\nas my blood lie at their door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stern voice of Wildfire, \xe2\x80\x9cthat said to Wilson at\r\nthis very spot, when he could not pray, owing to the galling agony of his\r\nfetters, that his pains would soon be over?--I say to you to take your\r\nown tale home; and if you cannot profit by the good man\xc3\xads lessons, blame\r\nnot them that are still more merciful to you than you were to others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Porteous Mob--95]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe procession now moved forward with a slow and determined pace. It was\r\nenlightened by many blazing, links and torches; for the actors of this\r\nwork were so far from affecting any secrecy on the occasion, that they\r\nseemed even to court observation. Their principal leaders kept close to\r\nthe person of the prisoner, whose pallid yet stubborn features were seen\r\ndistinctly by the torch-light, as his person was raised considerably\r\nabove the concourse which thronged around him. Those who bore swords,\r\nmuskets, and battle-axes, marched on each side, as if forming a regular\r\nguard to the procession. The windows, as they went along, were filled\r\nwith the inhabitants, whose slumbers had been broken by this unusual\r\ndisturbance. Some of the spectators muttered accents of encouragement;\r\nbut in general they were so much appalled by a sight so strange and\r\naudacious, that they looked on with a sort of stupified astonishment. No\r\none offered, by act or word, the slightest interruption.\r\n\r\nThe rioters, on their part, continued to act with the same air of\r\ndeliberate confidence and security which had marked all their\r\nproceedings. When the object of their resentment dropped one of his\r\nslippers, they stopped, sought for it, and replaced it upon his foot with\r\ngreat deliberation.*\r\n\r\n* This little incident, characteristic of the extreme composure of this\r\nextraordinary mob, was witnessed by a lady, who, disturbed like others\r\nfrom her slumbers, had gone to the window. It was told to the Author by\r\nthe lady\xc3\xads daughter.\r\n\r\nAs they descended the Bow towards the fatal spot where they designed to\r\ncomplete their purpose, it was suggested that there should be a rope kept\r\nin readiness. For this purpose the booth of a man who dealt in cordage\r\nwas forced open, a coil of rope fit for their purpose was selected to\r\nserve as a halter, and the dealer next morning found that a guinea had\r\nbeen left on his counter in exchange; so anxious were the perpetrators of\r\nthis daring action to show that they meditated not the slightest wrong or\r\ninfraction of law, excepting so far as Porteous was himself concerned.\r\n\r\nLeading, or carrying along with them, in this determined and regular\r\nmanner, the object of their vengeance, they at length reached the place\r\nof common execution, the scene of his crime, and destined spot of his\r\nsufferings. Several of the rioters (if they should not rather be\r\ndescribed as conspirators) endeavoured to remove the stone which filled\r\nup the socket in which the end of the fatal tree was sunk when it was\r\nerected for its fatal purpose; others sought for the means of\r\nconstructing a temporary gibbet, the place in which the gallows itself\r\nwas deposited being reported too secure to be forced, without much loss\r\nof time. Butler endeavoured to avail himself of the delay afforded by\r\nthese circumstances, to turn the people from their desperate design. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nGod\xc3\xads sake,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cremember it is the image of your Creator\r\nwhich you are about to deface in the person of this unfortunate man!\r\nWretched as he is, and wicked as he may be, he has a share in every\r\npromise of Scripture, and you cannot destroy him in impenitence without\r\nblotting his name from the Book of Life--Do not destroy soul and body;\r\ngive time for preparation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time had they,\xe2\x80\x9d returned a stern voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhom he murdered on this\r\nvery spot?--The laws both of God and man call for his death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Butler, with a generous disregard to his\r\nown safety--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat hath constituted you his judges?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not his judges,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the same person; \xe2\x80\x9che has been already\r\njudged and condemned by lawful authority. We are those whom Heaven, and\r\nour righteous anger, have stirred up to execute judgment, when a corrupt\r\nGovernment would have protected a murderer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am none,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unfortunate Porteous; \xe2\x80\x9cthat which you charge upon\r\nme fell out in self-defence, in the lawful exercise of my duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway with him--away with him!\xe2\x80\x9d was the general cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you trifle away time in making a gallows?--that dyester\xc3\xads pole is\r\ngood enough for the homicide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unhappy man was forced to his fate with remorseless rapidity. Butler,\r\nseparated from him by the press, escaped the last horrors of his\r\nstruggles. Unnoticed by those who had hitherto detained him as a\r\nprisoner,--he fled from the fatal spot, without much caring in what\r\ndirection his course lay. A loud shout proclaimed the stern delight with\r\nwhich the agents of this deed regarded its completion. Butler, then, at\r\nthe opening into the low street called the Cowgate, cast back a terrified\r\nglance, and, by the red and dusky light of the torches, he could discern\r\na figure wavering and struggling as it hung suspended above the heads of\r\nthe multitude, and could even observe men striking at it with their\r\nLochaber-axes and partisans. The sight was of a nature to double his\r\nhorror, and to add wings to his flight.\r\n\r\nThe street down which the fugitive ran opens to one of the eastern ports\r\nor gates of the city. Butler did not stop till he reached it, but found\r\nit still shut. He waited nearly an hour, walking up and down in\r\ninexpressible perturbation of mind. At length he ventured to call out,\r\nand rouse the attention of the terrified keepers of the gate, who now\r\nfound themselves at liberty to resume their office without interruption.\r\nButler requested them to open the gate. They hesitated. He told them his\r\nname and occupation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a preacher,\xe2\x80\x9d said one; \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard him preach in Haddo\xc3\xads-hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine preaching has he been at the night,\xe2\x80\x9d said another \xe2\x80\x9cbut maybe\r\nleast said is sunest mended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOpening then the wicket of the main gate, the keepers suffered Butler to\r\ndepart, who hastened to carry his horror and fear beyond the walls of\r\nEdinburgh. His first purpose was instantly to take the road homeward; but\r\nother fears and cares, connected with the news he had learned in that\r\nremarkable day, induced him to linger in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh\r\nuntil daybreak. More than one group of persons passed him as he was\r\nwhiling away the hours of darkness that yet remained, whom, from the\r\nstifled tones of their discourse, the unwonted hour when they travelled,\r\nand the hasty pace at which they walked, he conjectured to have been\r\nengaged in the late fatal transaction.\r\n\r\nCertain it was, that the sudden and total dispersion of the rioters, when\r\ntheir vindictive purpose was accomplished, seemed not the least\r\nremarkable feature of this singular affair. In general, whatever may be\r\nthe impelling motive by which a mob is at first raised, the attainment of\r\ntheir object has usually been only found to lead the way to farther\r\nexcesses. But not so in the present case. They seemed completely satiated\r\nwith the vengeance they had prosecuted with such stanch and sagacious\r\nactivity. When they were fully satisfied that life had abandoned their\r\nvictim, they dispersed in every direction, throwing down the weapons\r\nwhich they had only assumed to enable them to carry through their\r\npurpose. At daybreak there remained not the least token of the events of\r\nthe night, excepting the corpse of Porteous, which still hung suspended\r\nin the place where he had suffered, and the arms of various kinds which\r\nthe rioters had taken from the city guard-house, which were found\r\nscattered about the streets as they had thrown them from their hands when\r\nthe purpose for which they had seized them was accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary magistrates of the city resumed their power, not without\r\ntrembling at the late experience of the fragility of its tenure. To march\r\ntroops into the city, and commence a severe inquiry into the transactions\r\nof the preceding night, were the first marks of returning energy which\r\nthey displayed. But these events had been conducted on so secure and\r\nwell-calculated a plan of safety and secrecy, that there was little or\r\nnothing learned to throw light upon the authors or principal actors in a\r\nscheme so audacious. An express was despatched to London with the\r\ntidings, where they excited great indignation and surprise in the council\r\nof regency, and particularly in the bosom of Queen Caroline, who\r\nconsidered her own authority as exposed to contempt by the success of\r\nthis singular conspiracy. Nothing was spoke of for some time save the\r\nmeasure of vengeance which should be taken, not only on the actors of\r\nthis tragedy, so soon as they should be discovered, but upon the\r\nmagistrates who had suffered it to take place, and upon the city which\r\nhad been the scene where it was exhibited. On this occasion, it is still\r\nrecorded in popular tradition, that her Majesty, in the height of her\r\ndispleasure, told the celebrated John Duke of Argyle, that, sooner than\r\nsubmit to such an insult, she would make Scotland a hunting-field. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthat case, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered that high-spirited nobleman, with a profound\r\nbow, \xe2\x80\x9cI will take leave of your Majesty, and go down to my own country to\r\nget my hounds ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe import of the reply had more than met the ear; and as most of the\r\nScottish nobility and gentry seemed actuated by the same national spirit,\r\nthe royal displeasure was necessarily checked in mid-volley, and milder\r\ncourses were recommended and adopted, to some of which we may hereafter\r\nhave occasion to advert.*\r\n\r\n* Note D. Memorial concerning the murder of Captain Porteous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTH\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Arthur\xc3\xads Seat shall be my bed,\r\n                    The sheets shall ne\xc3\xader be pressed by me,\r\n                    St. Anton\xc3\xads well shall be my drink,\r\n                    Sin\xc3\xad my true-love\xc3\xads forsaken me.\r\n                                               Old Song.\r\n\r\nIf I were to choose a spot from which the rising or setting sun could be\r\nseen to the greatest possible advantage, it would be that wild path\r\nwinding around the foot of the high belt of semicircular rocks, called\r\nSalisbury Crags, and marking the verge of the steep descent which slopes\r\ndown into the glen on the south-eastern side of the city of Edinburgh.\r\nThe prospect, in its general outline, commands a close-built, high-piled\r\ncity, stretching itself out beneath in a form, which, to a romantic\r\nimagination, may be supposed to represent that of a dragon; now, a noble\r\narm of the sea, with its rocks, isles, distant shores, and boundary of\r\nmountains; and now, a fair and fertile champaign country, varied with\r\nhill, dale, and rock, and skirted by the picturesque ridge of the\r\nPentland mountains. But as the path gently circles around the base of the\r\ncliffs, the prospect, composed as it is of these enchanting and sublime\r\nobjects, changes at every step, and presents them blended with, or\r\ndivided from, each other, in every possible variety which can gratify the\r\neye and the imagination. When a piece of scenery so beautiful, yet so\r\nvaried,--so exciting by its intricacy, and yet so sublime,--is lighted up\r\nby the tints of morning or of evening, and displays all that variety of\r\nshadowy depth, exchanged with partial brilliancy, which gives character\r\neven to the tamest of landscapes, the effect approaches near to\r\nenchantment. This path used to be my favourite evening and morning\r\nresort, when engaged with a favourite author, or new subject of study. It\r\nis, I am informed, now become totally impassable; a circumstance which,\r\nif true, reflects little credit on the taste of the Good Town or its\r\nleaders.*\r\n\r\n* A beautiful and solid pathway has, within a few years, been formed\r\naround these romantic rocks; and the Author has the pleasure to think,\r\nthat the passage in the text gave rise to the undertaking.\r\n\r\n It was from this fascinating path--the scene to me of so much delicious\r\nmusing, when life was young and promised to be happy, that I have been\r\nunable to pass it over without an episodical description--it was, I say,\r\nfrom this romantic path that Butler saw the morning arise the day after\r\nthe murder of Porteous. It was possible for him with ease to have found a\r\nmuch shorter road to the house to which he was directing his course, and,\r\nin fact, that which he chose was extremely circuitous. But to compose his\r\nown spirits, as well as to while away the time, until a proper hour for\r\nvisiting the family without surprise or disturbance, he was induced to\r\nextend his circuit by the foot of the rocks, and to linger upon his way\r\nuntil the morning should be considerably advanced. While, now standing\r\nwith his arms across, and waiting the slow progress of the sun above the\r\nhorizon, now sitting upon one of the numerous fragments which storms had\r\ndetached from the rocks above him, he is meditating, alternately upon the\r\nhorrible catastrophe which he had witnessed, and upon the melancholy, and\r\nto him most interesting, news which he had learned at Saddletree\xc3\xads, we\r\nwill give the reader to understand who Butler was, and how his fate was\r\nconnected with that of Effie Deans, the unfortunate handmaiden of the\r\ncareful Mrs. Saddletree.\r\n\r\nReuben Butler was of English extraction, though born in Scotland. His\r\ngrandfather was a trooper in Monk\xc3\xads army, and one of the party of\r\ndismounted dragoons which formed the forlorn hope at the storming of\r\nDundee in 1651. Stephen Butler (called from his talents in reading and\r\nexpounding, Scripture Stephen, and Bible Butler) was a stanch\r\nIndependent, and received in its fullest comprehension the promise that\r\nthe saints should inherit the earth. As hard knocks were what had chiefly\r\nfallen to his share hitherto in the division of this common property, he\r\nlost not the opportunity which the storm and plunder of a commercial\r\nplace afforded him, to appropriate as large a share of the better things\r\nof this world as he could possibly compass. It would seem that he had\r\nsucceeded indifferently well, for his exterior circumstances appeared, in\r\nconsequence of this event, to have been much mended.\r\n\r\nThe troop to which he belonged was quartered at the village of Dalkeith,\r\nas forming the bodyguard of Monk, who, in the capacity of general for the\r\nCommonwealth, resided in the neighbouring castle. When, on the eve of the\r\nRestoration, the general commenced his march from Scotland, a measure\r\npregnant with such important consequences, he new-modelled his troops,\r\nand more especially those immediately about his person, in order that\r\nthey might consist entirely of individuals devoted to himself. On this\r\noccasion Scripture Stephen was weighed in the balance, and found wanting.\r\nIt was supposed he felt no call to any expedition which might endanger\r\nthe reign of the military sainthood, and that he did not consider himself\r\nas free in conscience to join with any party which might be likely\r\nultimately to acknowledge the interest of Charles Stuart, the son of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nlast man,\xe2\x80\x9d as Charles I. was familiarly and irreverently termed by them\r\nin their common discourse, as well as in their more elaborate\r\npredications and harangues. As the time did not admit of cashiering such\r\ndissidents, Stephen Butler was only advised in a friendly way to give up\r\nhis horse and accoutrements to one of Middleton\xc3\xads old troopers who\r\npossessed an accommodating conscience of a military stamp, and which\r\nsquared itself chiefly upon those of the colonel and paymaster. As this\r\nhint came recommended by a certain sum of arrears presently payable,\r\nStephen had carnal wisdom enough to embrace the proposal, and with great\r\nindifference saw his old corps depart for Coldstream, on their route for\r\nthe south, to establish the tottering Government of England on a new\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nThe _zone_ of the ex-trooper, to use Horace\xc3\xads phrase, was weighty enough\r\nto purchase a cottage and two or three fields (still known by the name of\r\nBeersheba), within about a Scottish mile of Dalkeith; and there did\r\nStephen establish himself with a youthful helpmate, chosen out of the\r\nsaid village, whose disposition to a comfortable settlement on this side\r\nof the grave reconciled her to the gruff manners, serious temper, and\r\nweather-beaten features of the martial enthusiast. Stephen did not long\r\nsurvive the falling on \xe2\x80\x9cevil days and evil tongues,\xe2\x80\x9d of which Milton, in\r\nthe same predicament, so mournfully complains. At his death his consort\r\nremained an early widow, with a male child of three years old, which, in\r\nthe sobriety wherewith it demeaned itself, in the old-fashioned and even\r\ngrim cast of its features, and in its sententious mode of expressing\r\nitself, would sufficiently have vindicated the honour of the widow of\r\nBeersheba, had any one thought proper to challenge the babe\xc3\xads descent\r\nfrom Bible Butler.\r\n\r\nButler\xc3\xads principles had not descended to his family, or extended\r\nthemselves among his neighbours. The air of Scotland was alien to the\r\ngrowth of independency, however favourable to fanaticism under other\r\ncolours. But, nevertheless, they were not forgotten; and a certain\r\nneighbouring Laird, who piqued himself upon the loyalty of his principles\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin the worst of times\xe2\x80\x9d (though I never heard they exposed him to more\r\nperil than that of a broken head, or a night\xc3\xads lodging in the main guard,\r\nwhen wine and cavalierism predominated in his upper storey), had found it\r\na convenient thing to rake up all matter of accusation against the\r\ndeceased Stephen. In this enumeration his religious principles made no\r\nsmall figure, as, indeed, they must have seemed of the most exaggerated\r\nenormity to one whose own were so small and so faintly traced, as to be\r\nwell nigh imperceptible. In these circumstances, poor widow Butler was\r\nsupplied with her full proportion of fines for nonconformity, and all the\r\nother oppressions of the time, until Beersheba was fairly wrenched out of\r\nher hands, and became the property of the Laird who had so wantonly, as\r\nit had hitherto appeared, persecuted this poor forlorn woman. When his\r\npurpose was fairly achieved, he showed some remorse or moderation, of\r\nwhatever the reader may please to term it, in permitting her to occupy\r\nher husband\xc3\xads cottage, and cultivate, on no very heavy terms, a croft of\r\nland adjacent. Her son, Benjamin, in the meanwhile, grew up to mass\r\nestate, and, moved by that impulse which makes men seek marriage, even\r\nwhen its end can only be the perpetuation of misery, he wedded and\r\nbrought a wife, and, eventually, a son, Reuben, to share the poverty of\r\nBeersheba.\r\n\r\nThe Laird of Dumbiedikes* had hitherto been moderate in his exactions,\r\nperhaps because he was ashamed to tax too highly the miserable means of\r\nsupport which remained to the widow Butler.\r\n\r\n* Dumbiedikes, selected as descriptive of the taciturn character of the\r\nimaginary owner, is really the name of a house bordering on the King\xc3\xads\r\nPark, so called because the late Mr. Braidwood, an instructor of the deaf\r\nand dumb, resided there with his pupils. The situation of the real house\r\nis different from that assigned to the ideal mansion.\r\n\r\nBut when a stout active young fellow appeared as the labourer of the\r\ncroft in question, Dumbiedikes began to think so broad a pair of\r\nshoulders might bear an additional burden. He regulated, indeed, his\r\nmanagement of his dependants (who fortunately were but few in number)\r\nmuch upon the principle of the carters whom he observed loading their\r\ncarts at a neighbouring coal-hill, and who never failed to clap an\r\nadditional brace of hundredweights on their burden, so soon as by any\r\nmeans they had compassed a new horse of somewhat superior strength to\r\nthat which had broken down the day before. However reasonable this\r\npractice appeared to the Laird of Dumbiedikes, he ought to have observed,\r\nthat it may be overdone, and that it infers, as a matter of course, the\r\ndestruction and loss of both horse, and cart, and loading. Even so it\r\nbefell when the additional \xe2\x80\x9cprestations\xe2\x80\x9d came to be demanded of Benjamin\r\nButler. A man of few words, and few ideas, but attached to Beersheba with\r\na feeling like that which a vegetable entertains to the spot in which it\r\nchances to be planted, he neither remonstrated with the Laird, nor\r\nendeavoured to escape from him, but, toiling night and day to accomplish\r\nthe terms of his taskmaster, fell into a burning fever and died. His wife\r\ndid not long survive him; and, as if it had been the fate of this family\r\nto be left orphans, our Reuben Butler was, about the year 1704-5, left in\r\nthe same circumstances in which his father had been placed, and under the\r\nsame guardianship, being that of his grandmother, the widow of Monk\xc3\xads old\r\ntrooper.\r\n\r\nThe same prospect of misery hung over the head of another tenant of this\r\nhardhearted lord of the soil. This was a tough true-blue Presbyterian,\r\ncalled Deans, who, though most obnoxious to the Laird on account of\r\nprinciples in church and state, contrived to maintain his ground upon the\r\nestate by regular payment of mail-duties, kain, arriage, carriage, dry\r\nmulture, lock, gowpen, and knaveship, and all the various exactions now\r\ncommuted for money, and summed up in the emphatic word rent. But the\r\nyears 1700 and 1701, long remembered in Scotland for dearth and general\r\ndistress, subdued the stout heart of the agricultural whig. Citations by\r\nthe ground-officer, decreets of the Baron Court, sequestrations,\r\npoindings of outside and inside plenishing, flew about his ears as fast\r\nas the tory bullets whistled around those of the Covenanters at Pentland,\r\nBothwell Brigg, or Airsmoss. Struggle as he might, and he struggled\r\ngallantly, \xe2\x80\x9cDouce David Deans\xe2\x80\x9d was routed horse and foot, and lay at the\r\nmercy of his grasping landlord just at the time that Benjamin Butler\r\ndied. The fate of each family was anticipated; but they who prophesied\r\ntheir expulsion to beggary and ruin were disappointed by an accidental\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nOn the very term-day when their ejection should have taken place, when\r\nall their neighbours were prepared to pity, and not one to assist them,\r\nthe minister of the parish, as well as a doctor from Edinburgh, received\r\na hasty summons to attend the Laird of Dumbiedikes. Both were surprised,\r\nfor his contempt for both faculties had been pretty commonly his theme\r\nover an extra bottle, that is to say, at least once every day. The leech\r\nfor the soul, and he for the body, alighted in the court of the little\r\nold manor-house at almost the same time; and when they had gazed a moment\r\nat each other with some surprise, they in the same breath expressed their\r\nconviction that Dumbiedikes must needs be very ill indeed, since he\r\nsummoned them both to his presence at once. Ere the servant could usher\r\nthem to his apartment, the party was augmented by a man of law, Nichil\r\nNovit, writing himself procurator before the sheriff-court, for in those\r\ndays there were no solicitors. This latter personage was first summoned\r\nto the apartment of the Laird, where, after some short space, the\r\nsoul-curer and the body-curer were invited to join him.\r\n\r\nDumbiedikes had been by this time transported into the best bedroom, used\r\nonly upon occasions of death and marriage, and called, from the former of\r\nthese occupations, the Dead-Room. There were in this apartment, besides\r\nthe sick person himself and Mr. Novit, the son and heir of the patient, a\r\ntall gawky silly-looking boy of fourteen or fifteen, and a housekeeper, a\r\ngood buxom figure of a woman, betwixt forty and fifty, who had kept the\r\nkeys and managed matters at Dumbiedikes since the lady\xc3\xads death. It was to\r\nthese attendants that Dumbiedikes addressed himself pretty nearly in the\r\nfollowing words; temporal and spiritual matters, the care of his health\r\nand his affairs, being strangely jumbled in a head which was never one of\r\nthe clearest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are sair times wi\xc3\xad me, gentlemen and neighbours! amaist as ill as\r\nat the aughty-nine, when I was rabbled by the collegeaners.*\r\n\r\n* Immediately previous to the Revolution, the students at the Edinburgh\r\nCollege were violent anti-catholics. They were strongly suspected of\r\nburning the house of Prestonfield, belonging to Sir James Dick, the Lord\r\nProvost; and certainly were guilty of creating considerable riots in\r\n1688-9.\r\n\r\n--They mistook me muckle--they ca\xc3\xadd me a papist, but there was never a\r\npapist bit about me, minister.--Jock, ye\xc3\xadll take warning--it\xc3\xads a debt we\r\nmaun a\xc3\xad pay, and there stands Nichil Novit that will tell ye I was never\r\ngude at paying debts in my life.--Mr. Novit, ye\xc3\xadll no forget to draw the\r\nannual rent that\xc3\xads due on the yerl\xc3\xads band--if I pay debt to other folk, I\r\nthink they suld pay it to me--that equals aquals.--Jock, when ye hae\r\nnaething else to do, ye may be aye sticking in a tree; it will be\r\ngrowing, Jock, when ye\xc3\xadre sleeping.*\r\n\r\n* The Author has been flattered by the assurance, that this _naive_ mode\r\nof recommending arboriculture (which was actually delivered in these very\r\nwords by a Highland laird, while on his death-bed, to his son) had so\r\nmuch weight with a Scottish earl as to lead to his planting a large tract\r\nof country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father tauld me sae forty years sin\xc3\xad, but I ne\xc3\xader fand time to mind\r\nhim--Jock, ne\xc3\xader drink brandy in the morning, it files the stamach sair;\r\ngin ye take a morning\xc3\xads draught, let it be aqua mirabilis; Jenny there\r\nmakes it weel--Doctor, my breath is growing as scant as a broken-winded\r\npiper\xc3\xads, when he has played for four-and-twenty hours at a penny\r\nwedding--Jenny, pit the cod aneath my head--but it\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad needless!--Mass\r\nJohn, could ye think o\xc3\xad rattling ower some bit short prayer, it wad do\r\nme gude maybe, and keep some queer thoughts out o\xc3\xad my head, Say\r\nsomething, man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot use a prayer like a rat-rhyme,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the honest clergyman;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand if you would have your soul redeemed like a prey from the fowler,\r\nLaird, you must needs show me your state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shouldna ye ken that without my telling you?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the patient.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I been paying stipend and teind, parsonage and vicarage, for,\r\never sin\xc3\xad the aughty-nine, and I canna get a spell of a prayer for\xc3\xadt, the\r\nonly time I ever asked for ane in my life?--Gang awa wi\xc3\xad your whiggery,\r\nif that\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad ye can do; auld Curate Kilstoup wad hae read half the\r\nprayer-book to me by this time--Awa wi\xc3\xad ye!--Doctor, let\xc3\xads see if ye can\r\ndo onything better for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had obtained some information in the meanwhile from the\r\nhousekeeper on the state of his complaints, assured him the medical art\r\ncould not prolong his life many hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen damn Mass John and you baith!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the furious and intractable\r\npatient. \xe2\x80\x9cDid ye come here for naething but to tell me that ye canna help\r\nme at the pinch? Out wi\xc3\xad them, Jenny--out o\xc3\xad the house! and, Jock, my\r\ncurse, and the curse of Cromwell, go wi\xc3\xad ye, if ye gie them either fee or\r\nbountith, or sae muckle as a black pair o\xc3\xad cheverons!\xe2\x80\x9d*\r\n\r\n*_Cheverons_--gloves.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman and doctor made a speedy retreat out of the apartment,\r\nwhile Dumbiedikes fell into one of those transports of violent and\r\nprofane language, which had procured him the surname of Damn-me-dikes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me the brandy bottle, Jenny, ye b--,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, with a voice in\r\nwhich passion contended with pain. \xe2\x80\x9cI can die as I have lived, without\r\nfashing ony o\xc3\xad them. But there\xc3\xads ae thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sinking his\r\nvoice--\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads ae fearful thing hings about my heart, and an anker of\r\nbrandy winna wash it away.--The Deanses at Woodend!--I sequestrated them\r\nin the dear years, and now they are to flit, they\xc3\xadll starve--and that\r\nBeersheba, and that auld trooper\xc3\xads wife and her oe, they\xc3\xadll\r\nstarve--they\xc3\xadll starve! --Look out, Jock; what kind o\xc3\xad night is\xc3\xadt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn-ding o\xc3\xad snaw, father,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jock, after having opened the window,\r\nand looked out with great composure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xc3\xadll perish in the drifts!\xe2\x80\x9d said the expiring sinner--\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xc3\xadll perish\r\nwi\xc3\xad cauld!--but I\xc3\xadll be het eneugh, gin a\xc3\xad tales be true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis last observation was made under breath, and in a tone which made the\r\nvery attorney shudder. He tried his hand at ghostly advice, probably for\r\nthe first time in his life, and recommended as an opiate for the agonised\r\nconscience of the Laird, reparation of the injuries he had done to these\r\ndistressed families, which, he observed by the way, the civil law called\r\n_restitutio in integrum._ But Mammon was struggling with Remorse for\r\nretaining his place in a bosom he had so long possessed; and he partly\r\nsucceeded, as an old tyrant proves often too strong for his insurgent\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna do\xc3\xadt,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a voice of despair. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would kill me\r\nto do\xc3\xadt--how can ye bid me pay back siller, when ye ken how I want it? or\r\ndispone Beersheba, when it lies sae weel into my ain plaid-nuik? Nature\r\nmade Dumbiedikes and Beersheba to be ae man\xc3\xads land--She did, by Nichil,\r\nit wad kill me to part them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ye maun die whether or no, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Novit; \xe2\x80\x9cand maybe ye wad\r\ndie easier--it\xc3\xads but trying. I\xc3\xadll scroll the disposition in nae time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinna speak o\xc3\xadt, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dumbiedikes, \xe2\x80\x9cor I\xc3\xadll fling the stoup at\r\nyour head.--But, Jock, lad, ye see how the warld warstles wi\xc3\xad me on my\r\ndeathbed--be kind to the puir creatures, the Deanses and the Butlers--be\r\nkind to them, Jock. Dinna let the warld get a grip o\xc3\xad ye, Jock--but keep\r\nthe gear thegither! and whate\xc3\xader ye do, dispone Beersheba at no rate. Let\r\nthe creatures stay at a moderate mailing, and hae bite and soup; it will\r\nmaybe be the better wi\xc3\xad your father whare he\xc3\xads gaun, lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter these contradictory instructions, the Laird felt his mind so much\r\nat ease, that he drank three bumpers of brandy continuously, and \xe2\x80\x9csoughed\r\nawa,\xe2\x80\x9d as Jenny expressed it, in an attempt to sing \xe2\x80\x9cDeil stick the\r\nMinister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis death made a revolution in favour of the distressed families. John\r\nDumbie, now of Dumbiedikes, in his own right, seemed to be close and\r\nselfish enough, but wanted the grasping spirit and active mind of his\r\nfather; and his guardian happened to agree with him in opinion, that his\r\nfather\xc3\xads dying recommendation should be attended to. The tenants,\r\ntherefore, were not actually turned out of doors among the snow-wreaths,\r\nand were allowed wherewith to procure butter-milk and peas-bannocks,\r\nwhich they ate under the full force of the original malediction. The\r\ncottage of Deans, called Woodend, was not very distant from that at\r\nBeersheba. Formerly there had been but little intercourse between the\r\nfamilies. Deans was a sturdy Scotsman, with all sort of prejudices\r\nagainst the southern, and the spawn of the southern. Moreover, Deans was,\r\nas we have said, a stanch Presbyterian, of the most rigid and unbending\r\nadherence to what he conceived to be the only possible straight line, as\r\nhe was wont to express himself, between right-hand heats and extremes and\r\nleft-hand defections; and, therefore, he held in high dread and horror\r\nall Independents, and whomsoever he supposed allied to them.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding these national prejudices and religious professions,\r\nDeans and the widow Butler were placed in such a situation, as naturally\r\nand at length created some intimacy between the families. They had shared\r\na common danger and a mutual deliverance. They needed each other\xc3\xads\r\nassistance, like a company, who, crossing a mountain stream, are\r\ncompelled to cling close together, lest the current should be too\r\npowerful for any who are not thus supported.\r\n\r\nOn nearer acquaintance, too, Deans abated some of his prejudices. He\r\nfound old Mrs. Butler, though not thoroughly grounded in the extent and\r\nbearing of the real testimony against the defections of the times, had no\r\nopinions in favour of the Independent party; neither was she an\r\nEnglishwoman. Therefore, it was to be hoped, that, though she was the\r\nwidow of an enthusiastic corporal of Cromwell\xc3\xads dragoons, her grandson\r\nmight be neither schismatic nor anti-national, two qualities concerning\r\nwhich Goodman Deans had as wholesome a terror as against papists and\r\nmalignants, Above all (for Douce Davie Deans had his weak side), he\r\nperceived that widow Butler looked up to him with reverence, listened to\r\nhis advice, and compounded for an occasional fling at the doctrines of\r\nher deceased husbands to which, as we have seen, she was by no means\r\nwarmly attached, in consideration of the valuable counsels which the\r\nPresbyterian afforded her for the management of her little farm. These\r\nusually concluded with \xe2\x80\x9cthey may do otherwise in England, neighbour\r\nButler, for aught I ken;\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cit may be different in foreign parts;\xe2\x80\x9d or,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey wha think differently on the great foundation of our covenanted\r\nreformation, overturning and mishguggling the government and discipline\r\nof the kirk, and breaking down the carved work of our Zion, might be for\r\nsawing the craft wi\xc3\xad aits; but I say peace, peace.\xe2\x80\x9d And as his advice was\r\nshrewd and sensible, though conceitedly given, it was received with\r\ngratitude, and followed with respect.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse which took place betwixt the families at Beersheba and\r\nWoodend became strict and intimate, at a very early period, betwixt\r\nReuben Butler, with whom the reader is already in some degree acquainted,\r\nand Jeanie Deans, the only child of Douce Davie Deans by his first wife,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat singular Christian woman,\xe2\x80\x9d as he was wont to express himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhose name was savoury to all that knew her for a desirable professor,\r\nChristian Menzies in Hochmagirdle.\xe2\x80\x9d The manner of which intimacy, and the\r\nconsequences thereof, we now proceed to relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Reuben and Rachel, though as fond as doves,\r\n              Were yet discreet and cautious in their loves,\r\n              Nor would attend to Cupid\xc3\xads wild commands,\r\n              Till cool reflection bade them join their hands;\r\n              When both were poor, they thought it argued ill\r\n                Of hasty love to make them poorer still.\r\n                                      Crabbe\xc3\xads _Parish Register._\r\n\r\nWhile widow Butler and widower Deans struggled with poverty, and the hard\r\nand sterile soil of \xe2\x80\x9cthose parts and portions\xe2\x80\x9d of the lands of\r\nDumbiedikes which it was their lot to occupy, it became gradually\r\napparent that Deans was to gain the strife, and his ally in the conflict\r\nwas to lose it. The former was a Man, and not much past the prime of\r\nlife--Mrs. Butler a woman, and declined into the vale of years, This,\r\nindeed, ought in time to have been balanced by the circumstance, that\r\nReuben was growing up to assist his grandmothers labours, and that Jeanie\r\nDeans, as a girl, could be only supposed to add to her father\xc3\xads burdens.\r\nBut Douce Davie Deans know better things, and so schooled and trained the\r\nyoung minion, as he called her, that from the time she could walk,\r\nupwards, she was daily employed in some task or other, suitable to her\r\nage and capacity; a circumstance which, added to her father\xc3\xads daily\r\ninstructions and lectures, tended to give her mind, even when a child, a\r\ngrave, serious, firm, and reflecting cast. An uncommonly strong and\r\nhealthy temperament, free from all nervous affection and every other\r\nirregularity, which, attacking the body in its more noble functions, so\r\noften influences the mind, tended greatly to establish this fortitude,\r\nsimplicity, and decision of character.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Reuben was weak in constitution, and, though not timid\r\nin temper might be safely pronounced anxious, doubtful, and apprehensive.\r\nHe partook of the temperament of his mother, who had died of a\r\nconsumption in early age. He was a pale, thin, feeble, sickly boy, and\r\nsomewhat lame, from an accident in early youth. He was, besides, the\r\nchild of a doting grandmother, whose too solicitous attention to him soon\r\ntaught him a sort of diffidence in himself, with a disposition to\r\noverrate his own importance, which is one of the very worst consequences\r\nthat children deduce from over-indulgence.\r\n\r\nStill, however, the two children clung to each other\xc3\xads society, not more\r\nfrom habit than from taste. They herded together the handful of sheep,\r\nwith the two or three cows, which their parents turned out rather to seek\r\nfood than actually to feed upon the unenclosed common of Dumbiedikes. It\r\nwas there that the two urchins might be seen seated beneath a blooming\r\nbush of whin, their little faces laid close together under the shadow of\r\nthe same plaid drawn over both their heads, while the landscape around\r\nwas embrowned by an overshadowing cloud, big with the shower which had\r\ndriven the children to shelter. On other occasions they went together to\r\nschool, the boy receiving that encouragement and example from his\r\ncompanion, in crossing the little brooks which intersected their path,\r\nand encountering cattle, dogs, and other perils, upon their journey,\r\nwhich the male sex in such cases usually consider it as their prerogative\r\nto extend to the weaker. But when, seated on the benches of the\r\nschool-house, they began to con their lessons together, Reuben, who was\r\nas much superior to Jeanie Deans in acuteness of intellect, as inferior\r\nto her in firmness of constitution, and in that insensibility to fatigue\r\nand danger which depends on the conformation of the nerves, was able\r\nfully to requite the kindness and countenance with which, in other\r\ncircumstances, she used to regard him. He was decidedly the best scholar\r\nat the little parish school; and so gentle was his temper and\r\ndisposition, that he was rather admired than envied by the little mob who\r\noccupied the noisy mansion, although he was the declared favourite of the\r\nmaster. Several girls, in particular (for in Scotland they are taught\r\nwith the boys), longed to be kind to and comfort the sickly lad, who was\r\nso much cleverer than his companions. The character of Reuben Butler was\r\nso calculated as to offer scope both for their sympathy and their\r\nadmiration, the feelings, perhaps, through which the female sex (the more\r\ndeserving part of them at least) is more easily attached.\r\n\r\nBut Reuben, naturally reserved and distant, improved none of these\r\nadvantages; and only became more attached to Jeanie Deans, as the\r\nenthusiastic approbation of his master assured him of fair prospects in\r\nfuture life, and awakened his ambition. In the meantime, every advance\r\nthat Reuben made in learning (and, considering his opportunities, they\r\nwere uncommonly great) rendered him less capable of attending to the\r\ndomestic duties of his grandmother\xc3\xads farm. While studying the _pons\r\nasinorum_ in Euclid, he suffered every _cuddie_ upon the common to\r\ntrespass upon a large field of peas belonging to the Laird, and nothing\r\nbut the active exertions of Jeanie Deans, with her little dog Dustiefoot,\r\ncould have saved great loss and consequent punishment. Similar\r\nmiscarriages marked his progress in his classical studies. He read\r\nVirgil\xc3\xads Georgics till he did not know bere from barley; and had nearly\r\ndestroyed the crofts of Beersheba while attempting to cultivate them\r\naccording to the practice of Columella and Cato the Censor.\r\n\r\nThese blunders occasioned grief to his grand-dame, and disconcerted the\r\ngood opinion which her neighbour, Davie Deans, had for some time\r\nentertained of Reuben.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see naething ye can make of that silly callant, neighbour Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he to the old lady, \xe2\x80\x9cunless ye train him to the wark o\xc3\xad the\r\nministry. And ne\xc3\xader was there mair need of poorfu\xc3\xad preachers than e\xc3\xaden\r\nnow in these cauld Gallio days, when men\xc3\xads hearts are hardened like the\r\nnether mill-stone, till they come to regard none of these things. It\xc3\xads\r\nevident this puir callant of yours will never be able to do an usefu\xc3\xad\r\nday\xc3\xads wark, unless it be as an ambassador from our Master; and I will\r\nmake it my business to procure a license when he is fit for the same,\r\ntrusting he will be a shaft cleanly polished, and meet to be used in the\r\nbody of the kirk; and that he shall not turn again, like the sow, to\r\nwallow in the mire of heretical extremes and defections, but shall have\r\nthe wings of a dove, though he hath lain among the pots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor widow gulped down the affront to her husband\xc3\xads principles,\r\nimplied in this caution, and hastened to take Butler from the High\r\nSchool, and encourage him in the pursuit of mathematics and divinity, the\r\nonly physics and ethics that chanced to be in fashion at the time.\r\n\r\nJeanie Deans was now compelled to part from the companion of her labour,\r\nher study, and her pastime, and it was with more than childish feeling\r\nthat both children regarded the separation. But they were young, and hope\r\nwas high, and they separated like those who hope to meet again at a more\r\nauspicious hour. While Reuben Butler was acquiring at the University of\r\nSt. Andrews the knowledge necessary for a clergyman, and macerating his\r\nbody with the privations which were necessary in seeking food for his\r\nmind, his grand-dame became daily less able to struggle with her little\r\nfarm, and was at length obliged to throw it up to the new Laird of\r\nDumbiedikes. That great personage was no absolute Jew, and did not cheat\r\nher in making the bargain more than was tolerable. He even gave her\r\npermission to tenant the house in which she had lived with her husband,\r\nas long as it should be \xe2\x80\x9ctenantable;\xe2\x80\x9d only he protested against paying\r\nfor a farthing of repairs, any benevolence which he possessed being of\r\nthe passive, but by no means of the active mood.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, from superior shrewdness, skill, and other\r\ncircumstances, some of them purely accidental, Davie Deans gained a\r\nfooting in the world, the possession of some wealth, the reputation of\r\nmore, and a growing disposition to preserve and increase his store; for\r\nwhich, when he thought upon it seriously, he was inclined to blame\r\nhimself. From his knowledge in agriculture, as it was then practised, he\r\nbecame a sort of favourite with the Laird, who had no great pleasure\r\neither in active sports or in society, and was wont to end his daily\r\nsaunter by calling at the cottage of Woodend.\r\n\r\nBeing himself a man of slow ideas and confused utterance, Dumbiedikes\r\nused to sit or stand for half-an-hour with an old laced hat of his\r\nfather\xc3\xads upon his head, and an empty tobacco-pipe in his mouth, with his\r\neyes following Jeanie Deans, or \xe2\x80\x9cthe lassie\xe2\x80\x9d as he called her, through\r\nthe course of her daily domestic labour; while her father, after\r\nexhausting the subject of bestial, of ploughs, and of harrows, often took\r\nan opportunity of going full-sail into controversial subjects, to which\r\ndiscussions the dignitary listened with much seeming patience, but\r\nwithout making any reply, or, indeed, as most people thought, without\r\nunderstanding a single word of what the orator was saying. Deans, indeed,\r\ndenied this stoutly, as an insult at once to his own talents for\r\nexpounding hidden truths, of which he was a little vain, and to the\r\nLaird\xc3\xads capacity of understanding them. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cDumbiedikes was nane of\r\nthese flashy gentles, wi\xc3\xad lace on their skirts and swords at their tails,\r\nthat were rather for riding on horseback to hell than gauging barefooted\r\nto heaven. He wasna like his father--nae profane company-keeper--nae\r\nswearer--nae drinker--nae frequenter of play-house, or music-house, or\r\ndancing-house--nae Sabbath-breaker--nae imposer of aiths, or bonds, or\r\ndenier of liberty to the flock.--He clave to the warld, and the warld\xc3\xads\r\ngear, a wee ower muckle, but then there was some breathing of a gale upon\r\nhis spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. etc. All this honest Davie said and believed.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed, that, by a father and a man of sense and\r\nobservation, the constant direction of the Laird\xc3\xads eyes towards Jeanie\r\nwas altogether unnoticed. This circumstance, however, made a much greater\r\nimpression upon another member of his family, a second helpmate, to wit,\r\nwhom he had chosen to take to his bosom ten years after the death of his\r\nfirst. Some people were of opinion, that Douce Davie had been rather\r\nsurprised into this step, for, in general, he was no friend to marriages\r\nor giving in marriage, and seemed rather to regard that state of society\r\nas a necessary evil,--a thing lawful, and to be tolerated in the\r\nimperfect state of our nature, but which clipped the wings with which we\r\nought to soar upwards, and tethered the soul to its mansion of clay, and\r\nthe creature-comforts of wife and bairns. His own practice, however, had\r\nin this material point varied from his principles, since, as we have\r\nseen, he twice knitted for himself this dangerous and ensnaring\r\nentanglement.\r\n\r\nRebecca, his spouse, had by no means the same horror of matrimony, and as\r\nshe made marriages in imagination for every neighbour round, she failed\r\nnot to indicate a match betwixt Dumbiedikes and her step-daughter Jeanie.\r\nThe goodman used regularly to frown and pshaw whenever this topic was\r\ntouched upon, but usually ended by taking his bonnet and walking out of\r\nthe house, to conceal a certain gleam of satisfaction, which, at such a\r\nsuggestion, involuntarily diffused itself over his austere features.\r\n\r\nThe more youthful part of my readers may naturally ask, whether Jeanie\r\nDeans was deserving of this mute attention of the Laird of Dumbiedikes;\r\nand the historian, with due regard to veracity, is compelled to answer,\r\nthat her personal attractions were of no uncommon description. She was\r\nshort, and rather too stoutly made for her size, had grey eyes, light\r\ncoloured hair, a round good-humoured face, much tanned with the sun, and\r\nher only peculiar charm was an air of inexpressible serenity, which a\r\ngood conscience, kind feelings, contented temper, and the regular\r\ndischarge of all her duties, spread over her features. There was nothing,\r\nit may be supposed, very appalling in the form or manners of this rustic\r\nheroine; yet, whether from sheepish bashfulness, or from want of decision\r\nand imperfect knowledge of his own mind on the subject, the Laird of\r\nDumbiedikes, with his old laced hat and empty tobacco-pipe, came and\r\nenjoyed the beatific vision of Jeanie Deans day after day, week after\r\nweek, year after year, without proposing to accomplish any of the\r\nprophecies of the stepmother.\r\n\r\nThis good lady began to grow doubly impatient on the subject, when, after\r\nhaving been some years married, she herself presented Douce Davie with\r\nanother daughter, who was named Euphemia, by corruption, Effie. It was\r\nthen that Rebecca began to turn impatient with the slow pace at which the\r\nLaird\xc3\xads wooing proceeded, judiciously arguing, that, as Lady Dumbiedikes\r\nwould have but little occasion for tocher, the principal part of her\r\ngudeman\xc3\xads substance would naturally descend to the child by the second\r\nmarriage. Other step-dames have tried less laudable means for clearing\r\nthe way to the succession of their own children; but Rebecca, to do her\r\njustice, only sought little Effie\xc3\xads advantage through the promotion, or\r\nwhich must have generally been accounted such, of her elder sister. She\r\ntherefore tried every female art within the compass of her simple skill,\r\nto bring the Laird to a point; but had the mortification to perceive that\r\nher efforts, like those of an unskilful angler, only scared the trout she\r\nmeant to catch. Upon one occasion, in particular, when she joked with the\r\nLaird on the propriety of giving a mistress to the house of Dumbiedikes,\r\nhe was so effectually startled, that neither laced hat, tobacco-pipe, nor\r\nthe intelligent proprietor of these movables, visited Woodend for a\r\nfortnight. Rebecca was therefore compelled to leave the Laird to proceed\r\nat his own snail\xc3\xads pace, convinced, by experience, of the grave-digger\xc3\xads\r\naphorism, that your dull ass will not mend his pace for beating.\r\n\r\nReuben, in the meantime, pursued his studies at the university, supplying\r\nhis wants by teaching the younger lads the knowledge he himself acquired,\r\nand thus at once gaining the means of maintaining himself at the seat of\r\nlearning, and fixing in his mind the elements of what he had already\r\nobtained. In this manner, as is usual among the poorer students of\r\ndivinity at Scottish universities, he contrived not only to maintain\r\nhimself according to his simple wants, but even to send considerable\r\nassistance to his sole remaining parent, a sacred duty, of which the\r\nScotch are seldom negligent. His progress in knowledge of a general kind,\r\nas well as in the studies proper to his profession, was very\r\nconsiderable, but was little remarked, owing to the retired modesty of\r\nhis disposition, which in no respect qualified him to set off his\r\nlearning to the best advantage. And thus, had Butler been a man given to\r\nmake complaints, he had his tale to tell, like others, of unjust\r\npreferences, bad luck, and hard usage. On these subjects, however, he was\r\nhabitually silent, perhaps from modesty, perhaps from a touch of pride,\r\nor perhaps from a conjunction of both.\r\n\r\nHe obtained his license as a preacher of the gospel, with some\r\ncompliments from the Presbytery by whom it was bestowed; but this did not\r\nlead to any preferment, and he found it necessary to make the cottage at\r\nBeersheba his residence for some months, with no other income than was\r\nafforded by the precarious occupation of teaching in one or other of the\r\nneighbouring families. After having greeted his aged grandmother, his\r\nfirst visit was to Woodend, where he was received by Jeanie with warm\r\ncordiality, arising from recollections which had never been dismissed\r\nfrom her mind, by Rebecca with good-humoured hospitality, and by old\r\nDeans in a mode peculiar to himself.\r\n\r\nHighly as Douce Davie honoured the clergy, it was not upon each\r\nindividual of the cloth that he bestowed his approbation; and, a little\r\njealous, perhaps, at seeing his youthful acquaintance erected into the\r\ndignity of a teacher and preacher, he instantly attacked him upon various\r\npoints of controversy, in order to discover whether he might not have\r\nfallen into some of the snares, defections, and desertions of the time.\r\nButler was not only a man of stanch Presbyterian principles, but was also\r\nwilling to avoid giving pain to his old friend by disputing upon points\r\nof little importance; and therefore he might have hoped to have come like\r\nfine gold out of the furnace of Davie\xc3\xads interrogatories. But the result\r\non the mind of that strict investigator was not altogether so favourable\r\nas might have been hoped and anticipated. Old Judith Butler, who had\r\nhobbled that evening as far as Woodend, in order to enjoy the\r\ncongratulations of her neighbours upon Reuben\xc3\xads return, and upon his high\r\nattainments, of which she was herself not a little proud, was somewhat\r\nmortified to find that her old friend Deans did not enter into the\r\nsubject with the warmth she expected. At first, in he seemed rather\r\nsilent than dissatisfied; and it was not till Judith had essayed the\r\nsubject more than once that it led to the following dialogue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, neibor Deans, I thought ye wad hae been glad to see Reuben amang\r\nus again, poor fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ glad, Mrs. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d was the neighbour\xc3\xads concise answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince he has lost his grandfather and his father (praised be Him that\r\ngiveth and taketh!), I ken nae friend he has in the world that\xc3\xads been sae\r\nlike a father to him as the sell o\xc3\xadye, neibor Deans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod is the only father of the fatherless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Deans, touching his\r\nbonnet and looking upwards. \xe2\x80\x9cGive honour where it is due, gudewife, and\r\nnot to an unworthy instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, that\xc3\xads your way o\xc3\xad turning it, and nae doubt ye ken best; but I\r\nhae ken\xc3\xadd ye, Davie, send a forpit o\xc3\xad meal to Beersheba when there wasna\r\na bow left in the meal-ark at Woodend; ay, and I hae ken\xc3\xadd ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGudewife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davie, interrupting her, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are but idle tales to\r\ntell me; fit for naething but to puff up our inward man wi\xc3\xad our ain vain\r\nacts. I stude beside blessed Alexander Peden, when I heard him call the\r\ndeath and testimony of our happy martyrs but draps of blude and scarts of\r\nink in respect of fitting discharge of our duty; and what suld I think of\r\nony thing the like of me can do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, neibor Deans, ye ken best; but I maun say that, I am sure you are\r\nglad to see my bairn again--the halt\xc3\xads gane now, unless he has to walk\r\nower mony miles at a stretch; and he has a wee bit colour in his cheek,\r\nthat glads my auld een to see it; and he has as decent a black coat as\r\nthe minister; and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very heartily glad he is weel and thriving,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Deans, with a\r\ngravity that seemed intended to cut short the subject; but a woman who is\r\nbent upon a point is not easily pushed aside from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Butler, \xe2\x80\x9che can wag his head in a pulpit now,\r\nneibor Deans, think but of that--my ain oe--and a\xc3\xadbody maun sit still and\r\nlisten to him, as if he were the Paip of Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe what?--the who?--woman!\xe2\x80\x9d said Deans, with a sternness far beyond his\r\nusual gravity, as soon as these offensive words had struck upon the\r\ntympanum of his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, guide us!\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor woman; \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgot what an ill will ye\r\nhad aye at the Paip, and sae had my puir gudeman, Stephen Butler. Mony an\r\nafternoon he wad sit and take up his testimony again the Paip, and again\r\nbaptizing of bairns, and the like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman!\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Deans, \xe2\x80\x9ceither speak about what ye ken something o\xc3\xad,\r\nor be silent; I say that independency is a foul heresy, and anabaptism a\r\ndamnable and deceiving error, whilk suld be rooted out of the land wi\xc3\xad\r\nthe fire o\xc3\xad the spiritual, and the sword o\xc3\xad the civil magistrate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, weel, neibor, I\xc3\xadll no say that ye mayna be right,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nsubmissive Judith. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure ye are right about the sawing and the\r\nmawing, the shearing and the leading, and what for suld ye no be right\r\nabout kirkwark, too?--But concerning my oe, Reuben Butler--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReuben Butler, gudewife,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, with solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cis a lad I wish\r\nheartily weel to, even as if he were mine ain son--but I doubt there will\r\nbe outs and ins in the track of his walk. I muckle fear his gifts will\r\nget the heels of his grace. He has ower muckle human wit and learning,\r\nand thinks as muckle about the form of the bicker as he does about the\r\nhealsomeness of the food--he maun broider the marriage-garment with lace\r\nand passments, or it\xc3\xads no gude eneugh for him. And it\xc3\xads like he\xc3\xads\r\nsomething proud o\xc3\xad his human gifts and learning, whilk enables him to\r\ndress up his doctrine in that fine airy dress. But,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, at seeing\r\nthe old woman\xc3\xads uneasiness at his discourse, \xe2\x80\x9caffliction may gie him a\r\njagg, and let the wind out o\xc3\xad him, as out o\xc3\xad a cow that\xc3\xads eaten wet\r\nclover, and the lad may do weel, and be a burning and a shining light;\r\nand I trust it will be yours to see, and his to feel it, and that soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWidow Butler was obliged to retire, unable to make anything more of her\r\nneighbour, whose discourse, though she did not comprehend it, filled her\r\nwith undefined apprehensions on her grandson\xc3\xads account, and greatly\r\ndepressed the joy with which she had welcomed him on his return. And it\r\nmust not be concealed, in justice to Mr. Deans\xc3\xads discernment, that\r\nButler, in their conference, had made a greater display of his learning\r\nthan the occasion called for, or than was likely to be acceptable to the\r\nold man, who, accustomed to consider himself as a person preeminently\r\nentitled to dictate upon theological subjects of controversy, felt rather\r\nhumbled and mortified when learned authorities were placed in array\r\nagainst him. In fact, Butler had not escaped the tinge of pedantry which\r\nnaturally flowed from his education, and was apt, on many occasions, to\r\nmake parade of his knowledge, when there was no need of such vanity.\r\n\r\nJeanie Deans, however, found no fault with this display of learning, but,\r\non the contrary, admired it; perhaps on the same score that her sex are\r\nsaid to admire men of courage, on account of their own deficiency in that\r\nqualification. The circumstances of their families threw the young people\r\nconstantly together; their old intimacy was renewed, though upon a\r\nfooting better adapted to their age; and it became at length understood\r\nbetwixt them, that their union should be deferred no longer than until\r\nButler should obtain some steady means of support, however humble. This,\r\nhowever, was not a matter speedily to be accomplished. Plan after plan\r\nwas formed, and plan after plan failed. The good-humoured cheek of Jeanie\r\nlost the first flush of juvenile freshness; Reuben\xc3\xads brow assumed the\r\ngravity of manhood, yet the means of obtaining a settlement seemed remote\r\nas ever. Fortunately for the lovers, their passion was of no ardent or\r\nenthusiastic cast; and a sense of duty on both sides induced them to\r\nbear, with patient fortitude, the protracted interval which divided them\r\nfrom each other.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, time did not roll on without effecting his usual\r\nchanges. The widow of Stephen Butler, so long the prop of the family of\r\nBeersheba, was gathered to her fathers; and Rebecca, the careful spouse\r\nof our friend Davie Deans, wa\xc3\xads also summoned from her plans of\r\nmatrimonial and domestic economy. The morning after her death, Reuben\r\nButler went to offer his mite of consolation to his old friend and\r\nbenefactor. He witnessed, on this occasion, a remarkable struggle betwixt\r\nthe force of natural affection and the religious stoicism which the\r\nsufferer thought it was incumbent upon him to maintain under each earthly\r\ndispensation, whether of weal or woe.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at the cottage, Jeanie, with her eyes overflowing with\r\ntears, pointed to the little orchard, \xe2\x80\x9cin which,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered with\r\nbroken accents, \xe2\x80\x9cmy poor father has been since his misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d Somewhat\r\nalarmed at this account, Butler entered the orchard, and advanced slowly\r\ntowards his old friend, who, seated in a small rude arbour, appeared to\r\nbe sunk in the extremity of his affliction. He lifted his eyes somewhat\r\nsternly as Butler approached, as if offended at the interruption; but as\r\nthe young man hesitated whether he ought to retreat or advance, he arose,\r\nand came forward to meet him with a self-possessed, and even dignified\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sufferer, \xe2\x80\x9clay it not to heart, though the\r\nrighteous perish, and the merciful are removed, seeing, it may well be\r\nsaid, that they are taken away from the evils to come. Woe to me were I\r\nto shed a tear for the wife of my bosom, when I might weep rivers of\r\nwater for this afflicted Church, cursed as it is with carnal seekers, and\r\nwith the dead of heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you can forget your private affliction\r\nin your regard for public duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForget, Reuben?\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Deans, putting his handkerchief to his\r\neyes--\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xc3\xads not to be forgotten on this side of time; but He that gives\r\nthe wound can send the ointment. I declare there have been times during\r\nthis night when my meditation hae been so rapt, that I knew not of my\r\nheavy loss. It has been with me as with the worthy John Semple, called\r\nCarspharn John,* upon a like trial--I have been this night on the banks\r\nof Ulai, plucking an apple here and there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Note E. Carspharn John.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the assumed fortitude of Deans, which he conceived to be\r\nthe discharge of a great Christian duty, he had too good a heart not to\r\nsuffer deeply under this heavy loss. Woodend became altogether\r\ndistasteful to him; and as he had obtained both substance and experience\r\nby his management of that little farm, he resolved to employ them as a\r\ndairy-farmer, or cowfeeder, as they are called in Scotland. The situation\r\nhe chose for his new settlement was at a place called Saint Leonard\xc3\xads\r\nCrags, lying betwixt Edinburgh and the mountain called Arthur\xc3\xads Seat, and\r\nadjoining to the extensive sheep pasture still named the King\xc3\xads Park,\r\nfrom its having been formerly dedicated to the preservation of the royal\r\ngame. Here he rented a small lonely house, about half-a-mile distant from\r\nthe nearest point of the city, but the site of which, with all the\r\nadjacent ground, is now occupied by the buildings which form the\r\nsoutheastern suburb. An extensive pasture-ground adjoining, which Deans\r\nrented from the keeper of the Royal Park, enabled him to feed his\r\nmilk-cows; and the unceasing industry and activity of Jeanie, his oldest\r\ndaughter, were exerted in making the most of their produce.\r\n\r\nShe had now less frequent opportunities of seeing Reuben, who had been\r\nobliged, after various disappointments, to accept the subordinate\r\nsituation of assistant in a parochial school of some eminence, at three\r\nor four miles\xc3\xad distance from the city. Here he distinguished himself, and\r\nbecame acquainted with several respectable burgesses, who, on account of\r\nhealth, or other reasons, chose that their children should commence their\r\neducation in this little village. His prospects were thus gradually\r\nbrightening, and upon each visit which he paid at Saint Leonard\xc3\xads he had\r\nan opportunity of gliding a hint to this purpose into Jeanie\xc3\xads ear. These\r\nvisits were necessarily very rare, on account of the demands which the\r\nduties of the school made upon Butler\xc3\xads time. Nor did he dare to make\r\nthem even altogether so frequent as these avocations would permit. Deans\r\nreceived him with civility indeed, and even with kindness; but Reuben, as\r\nis usual in such cases, imagined that he read his purpose in his eyes,\r\nand was afraid too premature an explanation on the subject would draw\r\ndown his positive disapproval. Upon the whole, therefore, he judged it\r\nprudent to call at Saint Leonard\xc3\xads just so frequently as old acquaintance\r\nand neighbourhood seemed to authorise, and no oftener. There was another\r\nperson who was more regular in his visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Laird in Jeanie\xc3\xads Cottage--130]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Davie Deans intimated to the Laird of Dumbiedikes his purpose of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cquitting wi\xc3\xad the land and house at Woodend,\xe2\x80\x9d the Laird stared and said\r\nnothing. He made his usual visits at the usual hour without remark, until\r\nthe day before the term, when, observing the bustle of moving furniture\r\nalready commenced, the great east-country _awmrie_ dragged out of its\r\nnook, and standing with its shoulder to the company, like an awkward\r\nbooby about to leave the room, the Laird again stared mightily, and was\r\nheard to ejaculate,--\xe2\x80\x9cHegh, sirs!\xe2\x80\x9d Even after the day of departure was\r\npast and gone, the Laird of Dumbiedikes, at his usual hour, which was\r\nthat at which David Deans was wont to \xe2\x80\x9cloose the pleugh,\xe2\x80\x9d presented\r\nhimself before the closed door of the cottage at Woodend, and seemed as\r\nmuch astonished at finding it shut against his approach as if it was not\r\nexactly what he had to expect. On this occasion he was heard to\r\nejaculate, \xe2\x80\x9cGude guide us!\xe2\x80\x9d which, by those who knew him, was considered\r\nas a very unusual mark of emotion. From that moment forward Dumbiedikes\r\nbecame an altered man, and the regularity of his movements, hitherto so\r\nexemplary, was as totally disconcerted as those of a boy\xc3\xads watch when he\r\nhas broken the main-spring. Like the index of the said watch did\r\nDumbiedikes spin round the whole bounds of his little property, which may\r\nbe likened unto the dial of the timepiece, with unwonted velocity. There\r\nwas not a cottage into which he did not enter, nor scarce a maiden on\r\nwhom he did not stare. But so it was, that although there were better\r\nfarm-houses on the land than Woodend, and certainly much prettier girls\r\nthan Jeanie Deans, yet it did somehow befall that the blank in the\r\nLaird\xc3\xads time was not so pleasantly filled up as it had been. There was no\r\nseat accommodated him so well as the \xe2\x80\x9cbunker\xe2\x80\x9d at Woodend, and no face he\r\nloved so much to gaze on as Jeanie Deans\xc3\xads. So, after spinning round and\r\nround his little orbit, and then remaining stationary for a week, it\r\nseems to have occurred to him that he was not pinned down to circulate on\r\na pivot, like the hands of the watch, but possessed the power of shifting\r\nhis central point, and extending his circle if he thought proper. To\r\nrealise which privilege of change of place, he bought a pony from a\r\nHighland drover, and with its assistance and company stepped, or rather\r\nstumbled, as far as Saint Leonard\xc3\xads Crags.\r\n\r\nJeanie Deans, though so much accustomed to the Laird\xc3\xads staring that she\r\nwas sometimes scarce conscious of his presence, had nevertheless some\r\noccasional fears lest he should call in the organ of speech to back those\r\nexpressions of admiration which he bestowed on her through his eyes.\r\nShould this happen, farewell, she thought, to all chance of a union with\r\nButler. For her father, however stouthearted and independent in civil and\r\nreligious principles, was not without that respect for the laird of the\r\nland, so deeply imprinted on the Scottish tenantry of the period.\r\nMoreover, if he did not positively dislike Butler, yet his fund of carnal\r\nlearning was often the object of sarcasms on David\xc3\xads part, which were\r\nperhaps founded in jealousy, and which certainly indicated no partiality\r\nfor the party against whom they were launched. And lastly, the match with\r\nDumbiedikes would have presented irresistible charms to one who used to\r\ncomplain that he felt himself apt to take \xe2\x80\x9cower grit an armfu\xc3\xad o\xc3\xad the\r\nwarld.\xe2\x80\x9d So that, upon the whole, the Laird\xc3\xads diurnal visits were\r\ndisagreeable to Jeanie from apprehension of future consequences, and it\r\nserved much to console her, upon removing from the spot where she was\r\nbred and born, that she had seen the last of Dumbiedikes, his laced hat,\r\nand tobacco-pipe. The poor girl no more expected he could muster courage\r\nto follow her to Saint Leonard\xc3\xads Crags than that any of her apple-trees\r\nor cabbages which she had left rooted in the \xe2\x80\x9cyard\xe2\x80\x9d at Woodend, would\r\nspontaneously, and unaided, have undertaken the same journey. It was\r\ntherefore with much more surprise than pleasure that, on the sixth day\r\nafter their removal to Saint Leonard\xc3\xads, she beheld Dumbiedikes arrive,\r\nlaced hat, tobacco-pipe, and all, and, with the self-same greeting of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad wi\xc3\xad ye, Jeanie?--Whare\xc3\xads the gudeman?\xe2\x80\x9d assume as nearly as he\r\ncould the same position in the cottage at Saint Leonard\xc3\xads which he had so\r\nlong and so regularly occupied at Woodend. He was no sooner, however,\r\nseated, than with an unusual exertion of his powers of conversation, he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cJeanie--I say, Jeanie, woman\xe2\x80\x9d--here he extended his hand towards\r\nher shoulder with all the fingers spread out as if to clutch it, but in\r\nso bashful and awkward a manner, that when she whisked herself beyond its\r\nreach, the paw remained suspended in the air with the palm open, like the\r\nclaw of a heraldic griffin--\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the swain in this moment\r\nof inspiration--\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Jeanie, it\xc3\xads a braw day out-by, and the roads are\r\nno that ill for boot-hose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jeanie--I say, Jeanie, woman--133\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deil\xc3\xads in the daidling body,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Jeanie between her teeth;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwha wad hae thought o\xc3\xad his daikering out this length?\xe2\x80\x9d And she\r\nafterwards confessed that she threw a little of this ungracious sentiment\r\ninto her accent and manner; for her father being abroad, and the \xe2\x80\x9cbody,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n as she irreverently termed the landed proprietor, \xe2\x80\x9clooking unco gleg and\r\ncanty, she didna ken what he might be coming out wi\xc3\xad next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer frowns, however, acted as a complete sedative, and the Laird relapsed\r\nfrom that day into his former taciturn habits, visiting the cowfeeder\xc3\xads\r\ncottage three or four times every week, when the weather permitted, with\r\napparently no other purpose than to stare at Jeanie Deans, while Douce\r\nDavie poured forth his eloquence upon the controversies and testimonies\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Her air, her manners, all who saw admired,\r\n              Courteous, though coy, and gentle, though retired;\r\n              The joy of youth and health her eyes displayed;\r\n              And ease of heart her every look conveyed.\r\n                                                       Crabbe.\r\n\r\nThe visits of the Laird thus again sunk into matters of ordinary course,\r\nfrom which nothing was to be expected or apprehended. If a lover could\r\nhave gained a fair one as a snake is said to fascinate a bird, by\r\npertinaciously gazing on her with great stupid greenish eyes, which began\r\nnow to be occasionally aided by spectacles, unquestionably Dumbiedikes\r\nwould have been the person to perform the feat. But the art of\r\nfascination seems among the _artes perditae,_ and I cannot learn that\r\nthis most pertinacious of starers produced any effect by his attentions\r\nbeyond an occasional yawn.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the object of his gaze was gradually attaining the\r\nverge of youth, and approaching to what is called in females the middle\r\nage, which is impolitely held to begin a few years earlier with their\r\nmore fragile sex than with men. Many people would have been of opinion,\r\nthat the Laird would have done better to have transferred his glances to\r\nan object possessed of far superior charms to Jeanie\xc3\xads, even when\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads were in their bloom, who began now to be distinguished by all\r\nwho visited the cottage at St. Leonard\xc3\xads Crags.\r\n\r\nEffie Deans, under the tender and affectionate care of her sister, had\r\nnow shot up into a beautiful and blooming girl. Her Grecian shaped head\r\nwas profusely rich in waving ringlets of brown hair, which, confined by a\r\nblue snood of silk, and shading a laughing Hebe countenance, seemed the\r\npicture of health, pleasure, and contentment. Her brown russet short-gown\r\nset off a shape, which time, perhaps, might be expected to render too\r\nrobust, the frequent objection to Scottish beauty, but which, in her\r\npresent early age, was slender and taper, with that graceful and easy\r\nsweep of outline which at once indicates health and beautiful proportion\r\nof parts.\r\n\r\nThese growing charms, in all their juvenile profusion, had no power to\r\nshake the steadfast mind, or divert the fixed gaze of the constant Laird\r\nof Dumbiedikes. But there was scarce another eye that could behold this\r\nliving picture of health and beauty, without pausing on it with pleasure.\r\nThe traveller stopped his weary horse on the eve of entering the city\r\nwhich was the end of his journey, to gaze at the sylph-like form that\r\ntripped by him, with her milk-pail poised on her head, bearing herself so\r\nerect, and stepping so light and free under her burden, that it seemed\r\nrather an ornament than an encumbrance. The lads of the neighbouring\r\nsuburb, who held their evening rendezvous for putting the stone, casting\r\nthe hammer, playing at long bowls, and other athletic exercises, watched\r\nthe motions of Effie Deans, and contended with each other which should\r\nhave the good fortune to attract her attention. Even the rigid\r\nPresbyterians of her father\xc3\xads persuasion, who held each indulgence of the\r\neye and sense to be a snare at least if not a crime, were surprised into\r\na moment\xc3\xads delight while gazing on a creature so exquisite,--instantly\r\nchecked by a sigh, reproaching at once their own weakness, and mourning\r\nthat a creature so fair should share in the common and hereditary guilt\r\nand imperfection of our nature, which she deserved as much by her\r\nguileless purity of thought, speech, and action, as by her uncommon\r\nloveliness of face and person.\r\n\r\nYet there were points in Effie\xc3\xads character which gave rise not only to\r\nstrange doubt and anxiety on the part of Douce David Deans, whose ideas\r\nwere rigid, as may easily be supposed, upon the subject of youthful\r\namusements, but even of serious apprehension to her more indulgent\r\nsister. The children of the Scotch of the inferior classes are usually\r\nspoiled by the early indulgence of their parents; how, wherefore, and to\r\nwhat degree, the lively and instructive narrative of the amiable and\r\naccomplished authoress of \xe2\x80\x9cGlenburnie\xe2\x80\x9d * has saved me and all future\r\nscribblers the trouble of recording.\r\n\r\n* [The late Mrs. Elizabeth Hamilton.]\r\n\r\nEffie had had a double share of this inconsiderate and misjudged\r\nkindness. Even the strictness of her father\xc3\xads principles could not\r\ncondemn the sports of infancy and childhood; and to the good old man, his\r\nyounger daughter, the child of his old age, seemed a child for some years\r\nafter she attained the years of womanhood, was still called the \xe2\x80\x9cbit\r\nlassie,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clittle Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d and was permitted to run up and down\r\nuncontrolled, unless upon the Sabbath, or at the times of family worship.\r\nHer sister, with all the love and care of a mother, could not be supposed\r\nto possess the same authoritative influence; and that which she had\r\nhitherto exercised became gradually limited and diminished as Effie\xc3\xads\r\nadvancing years entitled her, in her own conceit at least, to the right\r\nof independence and free agency. With all the innocence and goodness of\r\ndisposition, therefore, which we have described, the Lily of St.\r\nLeonard\xc3\xads possessed a little fund of self-conceit and obstinacy, and some\r\nwarmth and irritability of temper, partly natural perhaps, but certainly\r\nmuch increased by the unrestrained freedom of her childhood. Her\r\ncharacter will be best illustrated by a cottage evening scene.\r\n\r\nThe careful father was absent in his well-stocked byre, foddering those\r\nuseful and patient animals on whose produce his living depended, and the\r\nsummer evening was beginning to close in, when Jeanie Deans began to be\r\nvery anxious for the appearance of her sister, and to fear that she would\r\nnot reach home before her father returned from the labour of the evening,\r\nwhen it was his custom to have \xe2\x80\x9cfamily exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d and when she knew that\r\nEffie\xc3\xads absence would give him the most serious displeasure. These\r\napprehensions hung heavier upon her mind, because, for several preceding\r\nevenings, Effie had disappeared about the same time, and her stay, at\r\nfirst so brief as scarce to be noticed, had been gradually protracted to\r\nhalf-an-hour, and an hour, and on the present occasion had considerably\r\nexceeded even this last limit. And now, Jeanie stood at the door, with\r\nher hand before her eyes to avoid the rays of the level sun, and looked\r\nalternately along the various tracks which led towards their dwelling, to\r\nsee if she could descry the nymph-like form of her sister. There was a\r\nwall and a stile which separated the royal domain, or King\xc3\xads Park, as it\r\nis called, from the public road; to this pass she frequently directed her\r\nattention, when she saw two persons appear there somewhat suddenly, as if\r\nthey had walked close by the side of the wall to screen themselves from\r\nobservation. One of them, a man, drew back hastily; the other, a female,\r\ncrossed the stile, and advanced towards her--It was Effie. She met her\r\nsister with that affected liveliness of manner, which, in her rank, and\r\nsometimes in those above it, females occasionally assume to hide surprise\r\nor confusion; and she carolled as she came--\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cThe elfin knight sate on the brae,\r\n                    The broom grows bonny, the broom grows fair;\r\n                    And by there came lilting a lady so gay,\r\n                    And we daurna gang down to the broom nae mair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhisht, Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d said her sister; \xe2\x80\x9cour father\xc3\xads coming out o\xc3\xad the byre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n --The damsel stinted in her song.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhare hae ye been sae late at e\xc3\xaden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads no late, lass,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Effie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads chappit eight on every clock o\xc3\xad the town, and the sun\xc3\xads gaun down\r\nahint the Corstorphine hills--Whare can ye hae been sae late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae gate,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Effie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wha was that parted wi\xc3\xad you at the stile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaebody,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Effie once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae gate?--Naebody?--I wish it may be a right gate, and a right body,\r\nthat keeps folk out sae late at e\xc3\xaden, Effie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat needs ye be aye speering then at folk?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Effie. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadm sure,\r\nif ye\xc3\xadll ask nae questions, I\xc3\xadll tell ye nae lees. I never ask what\r\nbrings the Laird of Dumbiedikes glowering here like a wull-cat (only his\r\neen\xc3\xads greener, and no sae gleg), day after day, till we are a\xc3\xad like to\r\ngaunt our charts aft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause ye ken very weel he comes to see our father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, in\r\nanswer to this pert remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Dominie Butler--Does he come to see our father, that\xc3\xads sae taen wi\xc3\xad\r\nhis Latin words?\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, delighted to find that by carrying the war\r\ninto the enemy\xc3\xads country, she could divert the threatened attack upon\r\nherself, and with the petulance of youth she pursued her triumph over her\r\nprudent elder sister. She looked at her with a sly air, in which there\r\nwas something like irony, as she chanted, in a low but marked tone, a\r\nscrap of an old Scotch song--\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cThrough the kirkyard\r\n                    I met wi\xc3\xad the Laird,\r\n                    The silly puir body he said me nae harm;\r\n                    But just ere \xc3\xabtwas dark,\r\n                    I met wi\xc3\xad the clerk\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the songstress stopped, looked full at her sister, and, observing\r\nthe tears gather in her eyes, she suddenly flung her arms round her neck,\r\nand kissed them away. Jeanie, though hurt and displeased, was unable to\r\nresist the caresses of this untaught child of nature, whose good and evil\r\nseemed to flow rather from impulse than from reflection. But as she\r\nreturned the sisterly kiss, in token of perfect reconciliation, she could\r\nnot suppress the gentle reproof--\xe2\x80\x9cEffie, if ye will learn fule sangs, ye\r\nmight make a kinder use of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I might, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the girl, clinging to her sister\xc3\xads\r\nneck; \xe2\x80\x9cand I wish I had never learned ane o\xc3\xad them--and I wish we had\r\nnever come here--and I wish my tongue had been blistered or I had vexed\r\nye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that, Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the affectionate sister; \xe2\x80\x9cI canna be\r\nmuckle vexed wi\xc3\xad ony thing ye say to me--but O, dinna vex our father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not--I will not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Effie; \xe2\x80\x9cand if there were as mony\r\ndances the morn\xc3\xads night as there are merry dancers in the north firmament\r\non a frosty e\xc3\xaden, I winna budge an inch to gang near ane o\xc3\xad them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDance!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Jeanie Deans in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cO Effie, what could take\r\nye to a dance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is very possible, that, in the communicative mood into which the Lily\r\nof St. Leonard\xc3\xads was now surprised, she might have given her sister her\r\nunreserved confidence, and saved me the pain of telling a melancholy\r\ntale; but at the moment the word dance was uttered, it reached the ear of\r\nold David Deans, who had turned the corner of the house, and came upon\r\nhis daughters ere they were aware of his presence. The word _prelate,_ or\r\neven the word _pope,_ could hardly have produced so appalling an effect\r\nupon David\xc3\xads ear; for, of all exercises, that of dancing, which he termed\r\na voluntary and regular fit of distraction, he deemed most destructive of\r\nserious thoughts, and the readiest inlet to all sorts of licentiousness;\r\nand he accounted the encouraging, and even permitting, assemblies or\r\nmeetings, whether among those of high or low degree, for this fantastic\r\nand absurd purpose, or for that of dramatic representations, as one of\r\nthe most flagrant proofs of defection and causes of wrath. The\r\npronouncing of the word _dance_ by his own daughters, and at his own\r\ndoor, now drove him beyond the verge of patience. \xe2\x80\x9cDance!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDance!--dance, said ye? I daur ye, limmers that ye are, to name sic a\r\nword at my door-cheek! It\xc3\xads a dissolute profane pastime, practised by the\r\nIsraelites only at their base and brutal worship of the Golden Calf at\r\nBethel, and by the unhappy lass wha danced aff the head of John the\r\nBaptist, upon whilk chapter I will exercise this night for your farther\r\ninstruction, since ye need it sae muckle, nothing doubting that she has\r\ncause to rue the day, lang or this time, that e\xc3\xader she suld hae shook a\r\nlimb on sic an errand. Better for her to hae been born a cripple, and\r\ncarried frae door to door, like auld Bessie Bowie, begging bawbees, than\r\nto be a king\xc3\xads daughter, fiddling and flinging the gate she did. I hae\r\noften wondered that ony ane that ever bent a knee for the right purpose,\r\nshould ever daur to crook a hough to fyke and fling at piper\xc3\xads wind and\r\nfiddler\xc3\xads squealing. And I bless God (with that singular worthy, Peter\r\nWalker the packman at Bristo-Port),* that ordered my lot in my dancing\r\ndays, so that fear of my head and throat, dread of bloody rope and swift\r\nbullet, and trenchant swords and pain of boots and thumkins, cauld and\r\nhunger, wetness and weariness, stopped the lightness of my head, and the\r\nwantonness of my feet.\r\n\r\n* Note F. Peter Walker.\r\n\r\nAnd now, if I hear ye, quean lassies, sae muckle as name dancing, or\r\nthink there\xc3\xads sic a thing in this warld as flinging to fiddler\xc3\xads sounds,\r\nand piper\xc3\xads springs, as sure as my father\xc3\xads spirit is with the just, ye\r\nshall be no more either charge or concern of mine! Gang in, then--gang\r\nin, then, hinnies,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a softer tone, for the tears of both\r\ndaughters, but especially those of Effie, began to flow very fast,--\xe2\x80\x9cGang\r\nin, dears, and we\xc3\xadll seek grace to preserve us frae all, manner of\r\nprofane folly, whilk causeth to sin, and promoteth the kingdom of\r\ndarkness, warring with the kingdom of light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe objurgation of David Deans, however well meant, was unhappily timed.\r\nIt created a division of feelings in Effie\xc3\xads bosom, and deterred her from\r\nher intended confidence in her sister. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wad hand me nae better than\r\nthe dirt below her feet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cwere I to confess I hae\r\ndanced wi\xc3\xad him four times on the green down by, and ance at Maggie\r\nMacqueens\xc3\xads; and she\xc3\xadll maybe hing it ower my head that she\xc3\xadll tell my\r\nfather, and then she wad be mistress and mair. But I\xc3\xadll no gang back\r\nthere again. I\xc3\xadm resolved I\xc3\xadll no gang back. I\xc3\xadll lay in a leaf of my\r\nBible,* and that\xc3\xads very near as if I had made an aith, that I winna gang\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* This custom of making a mark by folding a leaf in the party\xc3\xads Bible,\r\nwhen a solemn resolution is formed, is still held to be, in some sense,\r\nan appeal to Heaven for his or her sincerity.\r\n\r\nAnd she kept her vow for a week, during which she was unusually cross and\r\nfretful, blemishes which had never before been observed in her temper,\r\nexcept during a moment of contradiction.\r\n\r\nThere was something in all this so mysterious as considerably to alarm\r\nthe prudent and affectionate Jeanie, the more so as she judged it unkind\r\nto her sister to mention to their father grounds of anxiety which might\r\narise from her own imagination. Besides, her respect for the good old man\r\ndid not prevent her from being aware that he was both hot-tempered and\r\npositive, and she sometimes suspected that he carried his dislike to\r\nyouthful amusements beyond the verge that religion and reason demanded.\r\nJeanie had sense enough to see that a sudden and severe curb upon her\r\nsister\xc3\xads hitherto unrestrained freedom might be rather productive of harm\r\nthan good, and that Effie, in the headstrong wilfulness of youth, was\r\nlikely to make what might be overstrained in her father\xc3\xads precepts an\r\nexcuse to herself for neglecting them altogether. In the higher classes,\r\na damsel, however giddy, is still under the dominion of etiquette, and\r\nsubject to the surveillance of mammas and chaperons; but the country\r\ngirl, who snatches her moment of gaiety during the intervals of labour,\r\nis under no such guardianship or restraint, and her amusement becomes so\r\nmuch the more hazardous. Jeanie saw all this with much distress of mind,\r\nwhen a circumstance occurred which appeared calculated to relieve her\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nMrs. Saddletree, with whom our readers have already been made acquainted,\r\nchanced to be a distant relation of Douce David Deans, and as she was a\r\nwoman orderly in her life and conversation, and, moreover, of good\r\nsubstance, a sort of acquaintance was formally kept up between the\r\nfamilies. Now, this careful dame, about a year and a half before our\r\nstory commences, chanced to need, in the line of her profession, a better\r\nsort of servant, or rather shop-woman. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nnever in the shop when he could get his nose within the Parliament House,\r\nand it was an awkward thing for a woman-body to be standing among bundles\r\no\xc3\xad barkened leather her lane, selling saddles and bridles; and she had\r\ncast her eyes upon her far-awa cousin Effie Deans, as just the very sort\r\nof lassie she would want to keep her in countenance on such occasions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this proposal there was much that pleased old David,--there was bed,\r\nboard, and bountith--it was a decent situation--the lassie would be under\r\nMrs. Saddletree\xc3\xads eye, who had an upright walk, and lived close by the\r\nTolbooth Kirk, in which might still be heard the comforting doctrines of\r\none of those few ministers of the Kirk of Scotland who had not bent the\r\nknee unto Baal, according to David\xc3\xads expression, or become accessory to\r\nthe course of national defections,--union, toleration, patronages, and a\r\nbundle of prelatical Erastian oaths which had been imposed on the church\r\nsince the Revolution, and particularly in the reign of \xe2\x80\x9cthe late woman\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (as he called Queen Anne), the last of that unhappy race of Stuarts. In\r\nthe good man\xc3\xads security concerning the soundness of the theological\r\ndoctrine which his daughter was to hear, he was nothing disturbed on\r\naccount of the snares of a different kind, to which a creature so\r\nbeautiful, young, and wilful, might be exposed in the centre of a\r\npopulous and corrupted city. The fact is, that he thought with so much\r\nhorror on all approaches to irregularities of the nature most to be\r\ndreaded in such cases, that he would as soon have suspected and guarded\r\nagainst Effie\xc3\xads being induced to become guilty of the crime of murder. He\r\nonly regretted that she should live under the same roof with such a\r\nworldly-wise man as Bartoline Saddletree, whom David never suspected of\r\nbeing an ass as he was, but considered as one really endowed with all the\r\nlegal knowledge to which he made pretension, and only liked him the worse\r\nfor possessing it. The lawyers, especially those amongst them who sate as\r\nruling elders in the General Assembly of the Kirk, had been forward in\r\npromoting the measures of patronage, of the abjuration oath, and others,\r\nwhich, in the opinion of David Deans, were a breaking down of the carved\r\nwork of the sanctuary, and an intrusion upon the liberties of the kirk.\r\nUpon the dangers of listening to the doctrines of a legalised formalist,\r\nsuch as Saddletree, David gave his daughter many lectures; so much so,\r\nthat he had time to touch but slightly on the dangers of chambering,\r\ncompany-keeping, and promiscuous dancing, to which, at her time of life,\r\nmost people would have thought Effie more exposed, than to the risk of\r\ntheoretical error in her religious faith.\r\n\r\nJeanie parted from her sister with a mixed feeling of regret, and\r\napprehension, and hope. She could not be so confident concerning Effie\xc3\xads\r\nprudence as her father, for she had observed her more narrowly, had more\r\nsympathy with her feelings, and could better estimate the temptations to\r\nwhich she was exposed. On the other hand, Mrs. Saddletree was an\r\nobserving, shrewd, notable woman, entitled to exercise over Effie the\r\nfull authority of a mistress, and likely to do so strictly, yet with\r\nkindness. Her removal to Saddletree\xc3\xads, it was most probable, would also\r\nserve to break off some idle acquaintances, which Jeanie suspected her\r\nsister to have formed in the neighbouring suburb. Upon the whole, then,\r\nshe viewed her departure from Saint Leonard\xc3\xads with pleasure, and it was\r\nnot until the very moment of their parting for the first time in their\r\nlives, that she felt the full force of sisterly sorrow. While they\r\nrepeatedly kissed each other\xc3\xads cheeks, and wrung each other\xc3\xads hands,\r\nJeanie took that moment of affectionate sympathy, to press upon her\r\nsister the necessity of the utmost caution in her conduct while residing\r\nin Edinburgh. Effie listened, without once raising her large dark\r\neyelashes, from which the drops fell so fast as almost to resemble a\r\nfountain. At the conclusion she sobbed again, kissed her sister, promised\r\nto recollect all the good counsel she had given her, and they parted.\r\n\r\nDuring the first weeks, Effie was all that her kinswoman expected, and\r\neven more. But with time there came a relaxation of that early zeal which\r\nshe manifested in Mrs. Saddletree\xc3\xads service. To borrow once again from\r\nthe poet, who so correctly and beautifully describes living manners:--\r\n\r\n\r\n               Something there was,--what, none presumed to say,--\r\n               Clouds lightly passing on a summer\xc3\xads day;\r\n               Whispers and hints, which went from ear to ear,\r\n               And mixed reports no judge on earth could clear.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval, Mrs. Saddletree was sometimes displeased by Effie\xc3\xads\r\nlingering when she was sent upon errands about the shop business, and\r\nsometimes by a little degree of impatience which she manifested at being\r\nrebuked on such occasions. But she good-naturedly allowed, that the first\r\nwas very natural to a girl to whom everything in Edinburgh was new and\r\nthe other was only the petulance of a spoiled child, when subjected to\r\nthe yoke of domestic discipline for the first time. Attention and\r\nsubmission could not be learned at once--Holyrood was not built in a\r\nday--use would make perfect.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the considerate old lady had presaged truly. Ere many\r\nmonths had passed, Effie became almost wedded to her duties, though she\r\nno longer discharged them with the laughing cheek and light step, which\r\nhad at first attracted every customer. Her mistress sometimes observed\r\nher in tears, but they were signs of secret sorrow, which she concealed\r\nas often as she saw them attract notice. Time wore on, her cheek grew\r\npale, and her step heavy. The cause of these changes could not have\r\nescaped the matronly eye of Mrs. Saddletree, but she was chiefly confined\r\nby indisposition to her bedroom for a considerable time during the latter\r\npart of Effie\xc3\xads service. This interval was marked by symptoms of anguish\r\nalmost amounting to despair. The utmost efforts of the poor girl to\r\ncommand her fits of hysterical agony were, often totally unavailing, and\r\nthe mistakes which she made in the shop the while, were so numerous and\r\nso provoking that Bartoline Saddletree, who, during his wife\xc3\xads illness,\r\nwas obliged to take closer charge of the business than consisted with his\r\nstudy of the weightier matters of the law, lost all patience with the\r\ngirl, who, in his law Latin, and without much respect to gender, he\r\ndeclared ought to be cognosced by inquest of a jury, as _fatuus,\r\nfuriosus,_ and _naturaliter idiota._ Neighbours, also, and\r\nfellow-servants, remarked with malicious curiosity or degrading pity, the\r\ndisfigured shape, loose dress, and pale cheeks, of the once beautiful and\r\nstill interesting girl. But to no one would she grant her confidence,\r\nanswering all taunts with bitter sarcasm, and all serious expostulation\r\nwith sullen denial, or with floods of tears.\r\n\r\nAt length, when Mrs. Saddletree\xc3\xads recovery was likely to permit her\r\nwonted attention to the regulation of her household, Effie Deans, as if\r\nunwilling to face an investigation made by the authority of her mistress,\r\nasked permission of Bartoline to go home for a week or two, assigning\r\nindisposition, and the wish of trying the benefit of repose and the\r\nchange of air, as the motives of her request. Sharp-eyed as a lynx (or\r\nconceiving himself to be so) in the nice sharp quillits of legal\r\ndiscussion, Bartoline was as dull at drawing inferences from the\r\noccurrences of common life as any Dutch professor of mathematics. He\r\nsuffered Effie to depart without much suspicion, and without any inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt was afterwards found that a period of a week intervened betwixt her\r\nleaving her master\xc3\xads house and arriving at St. Leonard\xc3\xads. She made her\r\nappearance before her sister in a state rather resembling the spectre\r\nthan the living substance of the gay and beautiful girl, who had left her\r\nfather\xc3\xads cottage for the first time scarce seventeen months before. The\r\nlingering illness of her mistress had, for the last few months, given her\r\na plea for confining herself entirely to the dusky precincts of the shop\r\nin the Lawnmarket, and Jeanie was so much occupied, during the same\r\nperiod, with the concerns of her father\xc3\xads household, that she had rarely\r\nfound leisure for a walk in the city, and a brief and hurried visit to\r\nher sister. The young women, therefore, had scarcely seen each other for\r\nseveral months, nor had a single scandalous surmise reached the ears of\r\nthe secluded inhabitants of the cottage at St. Leonard\xc3\xads. Jeanie,\r\ntherefore, terrified to death at her sister\xc3\xads appearance, at first\r\noverwhelmed her with inquiries, to which the unfortunate young woman\r\nreturned for a time incoherent and rambling answers, and finally fell\r\ninto a hysterical fit. Rendered too certain of her sister\xc3\xads misfortune,\r\nJeanie had now the dreadful alternative of communicating her ruin to her\r\nfather, or of endeavouring to conceal it from him. To all questions\r\nconcerning the name or rank of her seducer, and the fate of the being to\r\nwhom her fall had given birth, Effie remained as mute as the grave, to\r\nwhich she seemed hastening; and indeed the least allusion to either\r\nseemed to drive her to distraction. Her sister, in distress and in\r\ndespair, was about to repair to Mrs. Saddletree to consult her\r\nexperience, and at the same time to obtain what lights she could upon\r\nthis most unhappy affair, when she was saved that trouble by a new stroke\r\nof fate, which seemed to carry misfortune to the uttermost.\r\n\r\nDavid Deans had been alarmed at the state of health in which his daughter\r\nhad returned to her paternal residence; but Jeanie had contrived to\r\ndivert him from particular and specific inquiry. It was therefore like a\r\nclap of thunder to the poor old man, when, just as the hour of noon had\r\nbrought the visit of the Laird of Dumbiedikes as usual, other and\r\nsterner, as well as most unexpected guests, arrived at the cottage of St.\r\nLeonard\xc3\xads. These were the officers of justice, with a warrant of\r\njusticiary to search for and apprehend Euphemia, or Effie Deans, accused\r\nof the crime of child-murder. The stunning weight of a blow so totally\r\nunexpected bore down the old man, who had in his early youth resisted the\r\nbrow of military and civil tyranny, though backed with swords and guns,\r\ntortures and gibbets. He fell extended and senseless upon his own hearth;\r\nand the men, happy to escape from the scene of his awakening, raised,\r\nwith rude humanity, the object of their warrant from her bed, and placed\r\nher in a coach, which they had brought with them. The hasty remedies\r\nwhich Jeanie had applied to bring back her father\xc3\xads senses were scarce\r\nbegun to operate, when the noise of the wheels in motion recalled her\r\nattention to her miserable sister. To ran shrieking after the carriage\r\nwas the first vain effort of her distraction, but she was stopped by one\r\nor two female neighbours, assembled by the extraordinary appearance of a\r\ncoach in that sequestered place, who almost forced her back to her\r\nfather\xc3\xads house. The deep and sympathetic affliction of these poor people,\r\nby whom the little family at St. Leonard\xc3\xads were held in high regard,\r\nfilled the house with lamentation. Even Dumbiedikes was moved from his\r\nwonted apathy, and, groping for his purse as he spoke, ejaculated,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie, woman!--Jeanie, woman! dinna greet--it\xc3\xads sad wark, but siller\r\nwill help it;\xe2\x80\x9d and he drew out his purse as he spoke.\r\n\r\nThe old man had now raised himself from the ground, and, looking about\r\nhim as if he missed something, seemed gradually to recover the sense of\r\nhis wretchedness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a voice that made the roof ring,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhere is the vile harlot, that has disgraced the blood of an honest\r\nman?--Where is she, that has no place among us, but has come foul with\r\nher sins, like the Evil One, among the children of God?--Where is she,\r\nJeanie?--Bring her before me, that I may kill her with a word and a\r\nlook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll hastened around him with their appropriate sources of\r\nconsolation--the Laird with his purse, Jeanie with burnt feathers and\r\nstrong waters, and the women with their exhortations. \xe2\x80\x9cO neighbour--O\r\nMr. Deans, it\xc3\xads a sair trial, doubtless--but think of the Rock of Ages,\r\nneighbour--think of the promise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I do think of it, neighbours--and I bless God that I can think of\r\nit, even in the wrack and ruin of a\xc3\xad that\xc3\xads nearest and dearest to\r\nme--But to be the father of a castaway--a profligate--a bloody\r\nZipporah--a mere murderess!--O, how will the wicked exult in the high\r\nplaces of their wickedness!--the prelatists, and the latitudinarians,\r\nand the hand-waled murderers, whose hands are hard as horn wi\xc3\xad handing\r\nthe slaughter-weapons--they will push out the lip, and say that we are\r\neven such as themselves. Sair, sair I am grieved, neighbours, for the\r\npoor castaway--for the child of mine old age--but sairer for the\r\nstumbling-block and scandal it will be to all tender and honest souls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavie--winna siller do\xc3\xadt?\xe2\x80\x9d insinuated the laird, still proffering his\r\ngreen purse, which was full of guineas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell ye, Dumbiedikes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Deans, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if telling down my haill\r\nsubstance could hae saved her frae this black snare, I wad hae walked out\r\nwi\xc3\xad naething but my bonnet and my staff to beg an awmous for God\xc3\xads sake,\r\nand ca\xc3\xadd mysell an happy man--But if a dollar, or a plack, or the\r\nnineteenth part of a boddle, wad save her open guilt and open shame frae\r\nopen punishment, that purchase wad David Deans never make!--Na, na; an\r\neye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, life for life, blood for blood--it\xc3\xads\r\nthe law of man, and it\xc3\xads the law of God.--Leave me, sirs--leave me--I\r\nmaun warstle wi\xc3\xad this trial in privacy and on my knees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie, now in some degree restored to the power of thought, joined in\r\nthe same request. The next day found the father and daughter still in the\r\ndepth of affliction, but the father sternly supporting his load of ill\r\nthrough a proud sense of religious duty, and the daughter anxiously\r\nsuppressing her own feelings to avoid again awakening his. Thus was it\r\nwith the afflicted family until the morning after Porteous\xc3\xads death, a\r\nperiod at which we are now arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Is all the counsel that we two have shared,\r\n                The sisters\xc3\xad vows, the hours that we have spent\r\n                When we have chid the hasty-footed time\r\n                For parting us--Oh!--and is all forgot?\r\n                                           Midsummer Night\xc3\xads Dream.\r\n\r\nWe have been a long while in conducting Butler to the door of the cottage\r\nat St. Leonard\xc3\xads; yet the space which we have occupied in the preceding\r\nnarrative does not exceed in length that which he actually spent on\r\nSalisbury Crags on the morning which succeeded the execution done upon\r\nPorteous by the rioters. For this delay he had his own motives. He wished\r\nto collect his thoughts, strangely agitated as they were, first by the\r\nmelancholy news of Effie Deans\xc3\xads situation, and afterwards by the\r\nfrightful scene which he had witnessed. In the situation also in which he\r\nstood with respect to Jeanie and her father, some ceremony, at least some\r\nchoice of fitting time and season, was necessary to wait upon them. Eight\r\nin the morning was then the ordinary hour for breakfast, and he resolved\r\nthat it should arrive before he made his appearance in their cottage.\r\n\r\nNever did hours pass so heavily. Butler shifted his place and enlarged\r\nhis circle to while away the time, and heard the huge bell of St. Giles\xc3\xads\r\ntoll each successive hour in swelling tones, which were instantly\r\nattested by those of the other steeples in succession. He had heard seven\r\nstruck in this manner, when he began to think he might venture to\r\napproach nearer to St. Leonard\xc3\xads, from which he was still a mile distant.\r\nAccordingly he descended from his lofty station as low as the bottom of\r\nthe valley, which divides Salisbury Crags from those small rocks which\r\ntake their name from Saint Leonard. It is, as many of my readers may\r\nknow, a deep, wild, grassy valley, scattered with huge rocks and\r\nfragments which have descended from the cliffs and steep ascent to the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nThis sequestered dell, as well as other places of the open pasturage of\r\nthe King\xc3\xads Park, was, about this time, often the resort of the gallants\r\nof the time who had affairs of honour to discuss with the sword. Duels\r\nwere then very common in Scotland, for the gentry were at once idle,\r\nhaughty, fierce, divided by faction, and addicted to intemperance, so\r\nthat there lacked neither provocation, nor inclination to resent it when\r\ngiven; and the sword, which was part of every gentleman\xc3\xads dress, was the\r\nonly weapon used for the decision of such differences. When, therefore,\r\nButler observed a young man, skulking, apparently to avoid observation,\r\namong the scattered rocks at some distance from the footpath, he was\r\nnaturally led to suppose that he had sought this lonely spot upon that\r\nevil errand. He was so strongly impressed with this, that,\r\nnotwithstanding his own distress of mind, he could not, according to his\r\nsense of duty as a clergyman, pass this person without speaking to him.\r\nThere are times, thought he to himself, when the slightest interference\r\nmay avert a great calamity--when a word spoken in season may do more for\r\nprevention than the eloquence of Tully could do for remedying evil--And\r\nfor my own griefs, be they as they may, I shall feel them the lighter, if\r\nthey divert me not from the prosecution of my duty.\r\n\r\nThus thinking and feeling, he quitted the ordinary path, and advanced\r\nnearer the object he had noticed. The man at first directed his course\r\ntowards the hill, in order, as it appeared, to avoid him; but when he saw\r\nthat Butler seemed disposed to follow him, he adjusted his hat fiercely,\r\nturned round, and came forward, as if to meet and defy scrutiny.\r\n\r\nButler had an opportunity of accurately studying his features as they\r\nadvanced slowly to meet each other. The stranger seemed about twenty-five\r\nyears old. His dress was of a kind which could hardly be said to indicate\r\nhis rank with certainty, for it was such as young gentlemen sometimes\r\nwore while on active exercise in the morning, and which, therefore, was\r\nimitated by those of the inferior ranks, as young clerks and tradesmen,\r\nbecause its cheapness rendered it attainable, while it approached more\r\nnearly to the apparel of youths of fashion than any other which the\r\nmanners of the times permitted them to wear. If his air and manner could\r\nbe trusted, however, this person seemed rather to be dressed under than\r\nabove his rank; for his carriage was bold and somewhat supercilious, his\r\nstep easy and free, his manner daring and unconstrained. His stature was\r\nof the middle size, or rather above it, his limbs well-proportioned, yet\r\nnot so strong as to infer the reproach of clumsiness. His features were\r\nuncommonly handsome, and all about him would have been interesting and\r\nprepossessing but for that indescribable expression which habitual\r\ndissipation gives to the countenance, joined with a certain audacity in\r\nlook and manner, of that kind which is often assumed as a mask for\r\nconfusion and apprehension.\r\n\r\nButler and the stranger met--surveyed each other--when, as the latter,\r\nslightly touching his hat, was about to pass by him, Butler, while he\r\nreturned the salutation, observed, \xe2\x80\x9cA fine morning, sir--You are on the\r\nhill early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have business here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, in a tone meant to repress\r\nfarther inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not doubt it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cI trust you will forgive my\r\nhoping that it is of a lawful kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, with marked surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cI never forgive\r\nimpertinence, nor can I conceive what title you have to hope anything\r\nabout what no way concerns you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a soldier, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cand have a charge to arrest\r\nevil-doers in the name of my Master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA soldier!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, stepping back, and fiercely laying his\r\nhand on his sword--\xe2\x80\x9cA soldier, and arrest me! Did you reckon what your\r\nlife was worth, before you took the commission upon you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mistake me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cneither my warfare nor my\r\nwarrant are of this world. I am a preacher of the gospel, and have power,\r\nin my Master\xc3\xads name, to command the peace upon earth and good-will\r\ntowards men, which was proclaimed with the gospel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA minister!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, carelessly, and with an expression\r\napproaching to scorn. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the gentlemen of your cloth in Scotland\r\nclaim a strange right of intermeddling with men\xc3\xads private affairs. But I\r\nhave been abroad, and know better than to be priest-ridden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, if it be true that any of my cloth, or, it might be more decently\r\nsaid, of my calling, interfere with men\xc3\xads private affairs, for the\r\ngratification either of idle curiosity, or for worse motives, you cannot\r\nhave learned a better lesson abroad than to contemn such practices. But\r\nin my Master\xc3\xads work, I am called to be busy in season and out of season;\r\nand, conscious as I am of a pure motive, it were better for me to incur\r\nyour contempt for speaking, than the correction of my own conscience for\r\nbeing silent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9csay what you\r\nhave to say, then; though whom you take me for, or what earthly concern\r\nyou have with me, a stranger to you, or with my actions and motives, of\r\nwhich you can know nothing, I cannot conjecture for an instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cto violate one of your country\xc3\xads wisest\r\nlaws--you are about, which is much more dreadful, to violate a law, which\r\nGod himself has implanted within our nature, and written as it were, in\r\nthe table of our hearts, to which every thrill of our nerves is\r\nresponsive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the law you speak of?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, in a hollow and\r\nsomewhat disturbed accent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt do no murder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, with a deep and solemn voice.\r\n\r\nThe young man visibly started, and looked considerably appalled. Butler\r\nperceived he had made a favourable impression, and resolved to follow it\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cThink,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d laying his hand kindly upon the\r\nstranger\xc3\xads shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat an awful alternative you voluntarily choose\r\nfor yourself, to kill or be killed. Think what it is to rush uncalled\r\ninto the presence of an offended Deity, your heart fermenting with evil\r\npassions, your hand hot from the steel you had been urging, with your\r\nbest skill and malice, against the breast of a fellow-creature. Or,\r\nsuppose yourself the scarce less wretched survivor, with the guilt of\r\nCain, the first murderer, in your heart, with the stamp upon your\r\nbrow--that stamp which struck all who gazed on him with unutterable\r\nhorror, and by which the murderer is made manifest to all who look upon\r\nhim. Think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger gradually withdrew himself from under the hand of his\r\nmonitor; and, pulling his hat over his brows, thus interrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nmeaning, sir, I dare say, is excellent, but you are throwing your advice\r\naway. I am not in this place with violent intentions against any one. I\r\nmay be bad enough--you priests say all men are so--but I am here for the\r\npurpose of saving life, not of taking it away. If you wish to spend your\r\ntime rather in doing a good action than in talking about you know not\r\nwhat, I will give you an opportunity. Do you see yonder crag to the\r\nright, over which appears the chimney of a lone house? Go thither,\r\ninquire for one Jeanie Deans, the daughter of the goodman; let her know\r\nthat he she wots of remained here from daybreak till this hour, expecting\r\nto see her, and that he can abide no longer. Tell her, she _must_ meet me\r\nat the Hunter\xc3\xads Bog to-night, as the moon rises behind St. Anthony\xc3\xads\r\nHill, or that she will make a desperate man of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho or what are you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler, exceedingly and most unpleasantly\r\nsurprised, \xe2\x80\x9cwho charge me with such an errand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d--answered the young man hastily.\r\n\r\nButler stepped instinctively back, and commanded himself internally to\r\nHeaven; for, though a wise and strong-minded man, he was neither wiser\r\nnor more strong-minded than those of his age and education, with whom, to\r\ndisbelieve witchcraft or spectres, was held an undeniable proof of\r\natheism.\r\n\r\nThe stranger went on without observing his emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cYes! call me\r\nApollyon, Abaddon, whatever name you shall choose, as a clergyman\r\nacquainted with the upper and lower circles of spiritual denomination, to\r\ncall me by, you shall not find an appellation more odious to him that\r\nbears it, than is mine own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sentence was spoken with the bitterness of self-upbraiding, and a\r\ncontortion of visage absolutely demoniacal. Butler, though a man brave by\r\nprinciple, if not by constitution, was overawed; for intensity of mental\r\ndistress has in it a sort of sublimity which repels and overawes all men,\r\nbut especially those of kind and sympathetic dispositions. The stranger\r\nturned abruptly from Butler as he spoke, but instantly returned, and,\r\ncoming up to him closely and boldly, said, in a fierce, determined tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you who and what I am--who and what are you? What is your\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cButler,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the person to whom this abrupt question was addressed,\r\nsurprised into answering it by the sudden and fierce manner of the\r\nquerist--\xe2\x80\x9cReuben Butler, a preacher of the gospel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this answer, the stranger again plucked more deep over his brows the\r\nhat which he had thrown back in his former agitation. \xe2\x80\x9cButler!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated--\xe2\x80\x9cthe assistant of the schoolmaster at Liberton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Butler composedly.\r\n\r\nThe stranger covered his face with his hand, as if on sudden reflection,\r\nand then turned away, but stopped when he had walked a few paces; and\r\nseeing Butler follow him with his eyes, called out in a stern yet\r\nsuppressed tone, just as if he had exactly calculated that his accents\r\nshould not be heard a yard beyond the spot on which Butler stood. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\r\nyour way, and do mine errand. Do not look after me. I will neither\r\ndescend through the bowels of these rocks, nor vanish in a flash of fire;\r\nand yet the eye that seeks to trace my motions shall have reason to curse\r\nit was ever shrouded by eyelid or eyelash. Begone, and look not behind\r\nyou. Tell Jeanie Deans, that when the moon rises I shall expect to meet\r\nher at Nicol Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn, beneath Saint Anthony\xc3\xads Chapel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Anthony\xc3\xads Chapel--159]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he uttered these words, he turned and took the road against the hill,\r\nwith a haste that seemed as peremptory as his tone of authority.\r\n\r\nDreading he knew not what of additional misery to a lot which seemed\r\nlittle capable of receiving augmentation, and desperate at the idea that\r\nany living man should dare to send so extraordinary a request, couched in\r\nterms so imperious, to the half-betrothed object of his early and only\r\naffection, Butler strode hastily towards the cottage, in order to\r\nascertain how far this daring and rude gallant was actually entitled to\r\npress on Jeanie Deans a request, which no prudent, and scarce any modest\r\nyoung woman, was likely to comply with.\r\n\r\nButler was by nature neither jealous nor superstitious; yet the feelings\r\nwhich lead to those moods of the mind were rooted in his heart, as a\r\nportion derived from the common stock of humanity. It was maddening to\r\nthink that a profligate gallant, such as the manner and tone of the\r\nstranger evinced him to be, should have it in his power to command forth\r\nhis future bride and plighted true love, at a place so improper, and an\r\nhour so unseasonable. Yet the tone in which the stranger spoke had\r\nnothing of the soft half-breathed voice proper to the seducer who\r\nsolicits an assignation; it was bold, fierce, and imperative, and had\r\nless of love in it than of menace and intimidation.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of superstition seemed more plausible, had Butler\xc3\xads mind\r\nbeen very accessible to them. Was this indeed the Roaring Lion, who goeth\r\nabout seeking whom he may devour? This was a question which pressed\r\nitself on Butler\xc3\xads mind with an earnestness that cannot be conceived by\r\nthose who live in the present day. The fiery eye, the abrupt demeanour,\r\nthe occasionally harsh, yet studiously subdued tone of voice,--the\r\nfeatures, handsome, but now clouded with pride, now disturbed by\r\nsuspicion, now inflamed with passion--those dark hazel eyes which he\r\nsometimes shaded with his cap, as if he were averse to have them seen\r\nwhile they were occupied with keenly observing the motions and bearing of\r\nothers--those eyes that were now turbid with melancholy, now gleaming\r\nwith scorn, and now sparkling with fury--was it the passions of a mere\r\nmortal they expressed, or the emotions of a fiend, who seeks, and seeks\r\nin vain, to conceal his fiendish designs under the borrowed mask of manly\r\nbeauty? The whole partook of the mien, language, and port of the ruined\r\narchangel; and, imperfectly as we have been able to describe it, the\r\neffect of the interview upon Butler\xc3\xads nerves, shaken as they were at the\r\ntime by the horrors of the preceding night, were greater than his\r\nunderstanding warranted, or his pride cared to submit to. The very place\r\nwhere he had met this singular person was desecrated, as it were, and\r\nunhallowed, owing to many violent deaths, both in duels and by suicide,\r\nwhich had in former times taken place there; and the place which he had\r\nnamed as a rendezvous at so late an hour, was held in general to be\r\naccursed, from a frightful and cruel murder which had been there\r\ncommitted by the wretch from whom the place took its name, upon the\r\nperson of his own wife.*\r\n\r\n* Note G. Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn.\r\n\r\nIt was in such places, according to the belief of that period (when the\r\nlaws against witchcraft were still in fresh observance, and had even\r\nlately been acted upon), that evil spirits had power to make themselves\r\nvisible to human eyes, and to practise upon the feelings and senses of\r\nmankind. Suspicions, founded on such circumstances, rushed on Butler\xc3\xads\r\nmind, unprepared as it was by any previous course of reasoning, to deny\r\nthat which all of his time, country, and profession believed; but common\r\nsense rejected these vain ideas as inconsistent, if not with possibility,\r\nat least with the general rules by which the universe is governed,--a\r\ndeviation from which, as Butler well argued with himself, ought not to be\r\nadmitted as probable, upon any but the plainest and most incontrovertible\r\nevidence. An earthly lover, however, or a young man, who, from whatever\r\ncause, had the right of exercising such summary and unceremonious\r\nauthority over the object of his long-settled, and apparently sincerely\r\nreturned affection, was an object scarce less appalling to his mind, than\r\nthose which superstition suggested.\r\n\r\nHis limbs exhausted with fatigue, his mind harassed with anxiety, and\r\nwith painful doubts and recollections, Butler dragged himself up the\r\nascent from the valley to St. Leonard\xc3\xads Crags, and presented himself at\r\nthe door of Deans\xc3\xads habitation, with feelings much akin to the miserable\r\nreflections and fears of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Then she stretched out her lily hand,\r\n                        And for to do her best;\r\n                       \xe2\x80\x9cHae back thy faith and troth, Willie,\r\n                        God gie thy soul good rest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                                    Old Ballad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the low and sweet-toned voice he loved best to hear,\r\nas Butler tapped at the door of the cottage. He lifted the latch, and\r\nfound himself under the roof of affliction. Jeanie was unable to trust\r\nherself with more than one glance towards her lover, whom she now met\r\nunder circumstances so agonising to her feelings, and at the same time so\r\nhumbling to her honest pride. It is well known, that much, both of what\r\nis good and bad in the Scottish national character, arises out of the\r\nintimacy of their family connections. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be come of honest folk,\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nis, of people who have borne a fair and unstained reputation, is an\r\nadvantage as highly prized among the lower Scotch, as the emphatic\r\ncounterpart, \xe2\x80\x9cto be of a good family,\xe2\x80\x9d is valued among their gentry. The\r\nworth and respectability of one member of a peasant\xc3\xads family is always\r\naccounted by themselves and others, not only a matter of honest pride,\r\nbut a guarantee for the good conduct of the whole. On the contrary, such\r\na melancholy stain as was now flung on one of the children of Deans,\r\nextended its disgrace to all connected with him, and Jeanie felt herself\r\nlowered at once, in her own eyes, and in those of her lover. It was in\r\nvain that she repressed this feeling, as far subordinate and too selfish\r\nto be mingled with her sorrow for her sister\xc3\xads calamity. Nature\r\nprevailed; and while she shed tears for her sister\xc3\xads distress and danger,\r\nthere mingled with them bitter drops of grief for her own degradation.\r\n\r\nAs Butler entered, the old man was seated by the fire with his well-worn\r\npocket Bible in his hands, the companion of the wanderings and dangers of\r\nhis youth, and bequeathed to him on the scaffold by one of those, who, in\r\nthe year 1686, sealed their enthusiastic principles with their blood. The\r\nsun sent its rays through a small window at the old man\xc3\xads back, and,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshining motty through the reek,\xe2\x80\x9d to use the expression of a bard of that\r\ntime and country, illumined the grey hairs of the old man, and the sacred\r\npage which he studied. His features, far from handsome, and rather harsh\r\nand severe, had yet from their expression of habitual gravity, and\r\ncontempt for earthly things, an expression of stoical dignity amidst\r\ntheir sternness. He boasted, in no small degree, the attributes which\r\nSouthey ascribes to the ancient Scandinavians, whom he terms \xe2\x80\x9cfirm to\r\ninflict, and stubborn to endure.\xe2\x80\x9d The whole formed a picture, of which\r\nthe lights might have been given by Rembrandt, but the outline would have\r\nrequired the force and vigour of Michael Angelo.\r\n\r\nDeans lifted his eye as Butler entered, and instantly withdrew it, as\r\nfrom an object which gave him at once surprise and sudden pain. He had\r\nassumed such high ground with this carnal-witted scholar, as he had in\r\nhis pride termed Butler, that to meet him, of all men, under feelings of\r\nhumiliation, aggravated his misfortune, and was a consummation like that\r\nof the dying chief in the old ballad--\xe2\x80\x9cEarl Percy sees my fall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeans raised the Bible with his left hand, so as partly to screen his\r\nface, and putting back his right as far as he could, held it towards\r\nButler in that position, at the same time turning his body from, him, as\r\nif to prevent his seeing the working of his countenance. Butler clasped\r\nthe extended hand which had supported his orphan infancy, wept over it,\r\nand in vain endeavoured to say more than the words--\xe2\x80\x9cGod comfort you--God\r\ncomfort you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will--he doth, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Deans, assuming firmness as he\r\ndiscovered the agitation of his guest; \xe2\x80\x9che doth now, and he will yet more\r\nin his own gude time. I have been ower proud of my sufferings in a gude\r\ncause, Reuben, and now I am to be tried with those whilk will turn my\r\npride and glory into a reproach and a hissing. How muckle better I hae\r\nthought mysell than them that lay saft, fed sweet, and drank deep, when I\r\nwas in the moss-haggs and moors, wi\xc3\xad precious Donald Cameron, and worthy\r\nMr. Blackadder, called Guess-again; and how proud I was o\xc3\xad being made a\r\nspectacle to men and angels, having stood on their pillory at the\r\nCanongate afore I was fifteen years old, for the cause of a National\r\nCovenant! To think, Reuben, that I, wha hae been sae honoured and exalted\r\nin my youth, nay, when I was but a hafflins callant, and that hae borne\r\ntestimony again the defections o\xc3\xad the times yearly, monthly, daily,\r\nhourly, minutely, striving and testifying with uplifted hand and voice,\r\ncrying aloud, and sparing not, against all great national snares, as the\r\nnation-wasting and church-sinking abomination of union, toleration, and\r\npatronage, imposed by the last woman of that unhappy race of Stuarts;\r\nalso against the infringements and invasions of the just powers of\r\neldership, whereanent, I uttered my paper, called a \xc3\xabCry of an Howl in\r\nthe Desert,\xc3\xad printed at the Bow-head, and sold by all flying stationers\r\nin town and country--and _now_--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere he paused. It may well be supposed that Butler, though not\r\nabsolutely coinciding in all the good old man\xc3\xads ideas about church\r\ngovernment, had too much consideration and humanity to interrupt him,\r\nwhile he reckoned up with conscious pride his sufferings, and the\r\nconstancy of his testimony. On the contrary, when he paused under the\r\ninfluence of the bitter recollections of the moment, Butler instantly\r\nthrew in his mite of encouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been well known, my old and revered friend, a true and tried\r\nfollower of the Cross; one who, as Saint Jerome hath it, \xc3\xab_per infamiam\r\net bonam famam grassari ad immortalitatem,_\xc3\xad which may be freely\r\nrendered, \xc3\xabwho rusheth on to immortal life, through bad report and good\r\nreport.\xc3\xad You have been one of those to whom the tender and fearful\r\nsouls cry during the midnight solitude--\xc3\xabWatchman, what of the\r\nnight?--Watchman, what of the night?\xc3\xad--And, assuredly, this heavy\r\ndispensation, as it comes not without divine permission, so it comes\r\nnot without its special commission and use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do receive it as such,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Deans, returning the grasp of\r\nButler\xc3\xads hand; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I have not been taught to read the Scripture in\r\nany other tongue but my native Scottish\xe2\x80\x9d (even in his distress Butler\xc3\xads\r\nLatin quotation had not escaped his notice), \xe2\x80\x9cI have nevertheless so\r\nlearned them, that I trust to bear even this crook in my lot with\r\nsubmission. But, oh! Reuben Butler, the kirk, of whilk, though unworthy,\r\nI have yet been thought a polished shaft, and meet to be a pillar,\r\nholding, from my youth upward, the place of ruling elder--what will the\r\nlightsome and profane think of the guide that cannot keep his own family\r\nfrom stumbling? How will they take up their song and their reproach, when\r\nthey see that the children of professors are liable to as foul\r\nbacksliding as the offspring of Belial! But I will bear my cross with the\r\ncomfort, that whatever showed like goodness in me or mine, was but like\r\nthe light that shines frae creeping insects, on the brae-side, in a dark\r\nnight--it kythes bright to the ee, because all is dark around it; but\r\nwhen the morn comes on the mountains, it is, but a puir crawling\r\nkail-worm after a\xc3\xad. And sae it shows, wi\xc3\xad ony rag of human righteousness,\r\nor formal law-work, that we may pit round us to cover our shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he pronounced these words, the door again opened, and Mr. Bartoline\r\nSaddletree entered, his three-pointed hat set far back on his head, with\r\na silk handkerchief beneath it to keep it in that cool position, his\r\ngold-headed cane in his hand, and his whole deportment that of a wealthy\r\nburgher, who might one day look to have a share in the magistracy, if not\r\nactually to hold the curule chair itself.\r\n\r\nRochefoucault, who has torn the veil from so many foul gangrenes of the\r\nhuman heart, says, we find something not altogether unpleasant to us in\r\nthe misfortunes of our best friends. Mr. Saddletree would have been very\r\nangry had any one told him that he felt pleasure in the disaster of poor\r\nEffie Deans, and the disgrace of her family; and yet there is great\r\nquestion whether the gratification of playing the person of importance,\r\ninquiring, investigating, and laying down the law on the whole affair,\r\ndid not offer, to say the least, full consolation for the pain which pure\r\nsympathy gave him on account of his wife\xc3\xads kinswoman. He had now got a\r\npiece of real judicial business by the end, instead of being obliged, as\r\nwas his common case, to intrude his opinion where it was neither wished\r\nnor wanted; and felt as happy in the exchange as a boy when he gets his\r\nfirst new watch, which actually goes when wound up, and has real hands\r\nand a true dial-plate. But besides this subject for legal disquisition,\r\nBartoline\xc3\xads brains were also overloaded with the affair of Porteous, his\r\nviolent death, and all its probable consequences to the city and\r\ncommunity. It was what the French call _l\xc3\xadembarras des richesses,_ the\r\nconfusion arising from too much mental wealth. He walked in with a\r\nconsciousness of double importance, full fraught with the superiority of\r\none who possesses more information than the company into which he enters,\r\nand who feels a right to discharge his learning on them without mercy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Mr. Deans,--good-morrow to you, Mr. Butler,--I was not\r\naware that you were acquainted with Mr. Deans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler made some slight answer; his reasons may be readily imagined for\r\nnot making his connection with the family, which, in his eyes, had\r\nsomething of tender mystery, a frequent subject of conversation with\r\nindifferent persons, such as Saddletree.\r\n\r\nThe worthy burgher, in the plenitude of self-importance, now sate down\r\nupon a chair, wiped his brow, collected his breath, and made the first\r\nexperiment of the resolved pith of his lungs, in a deep and dignified\r\nsigh, resembling a groan in sound and intonation--\xe2\x80\x9cAwfu\xc3\xad times these,\r\nneighbour Deans, awfu\xc3\xad times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSinfu\xc3\xad, shamefu\xc3\xad, heaven-daring times!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Deans, in a lower and\r\nmore subdued tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Saddletree, swelling with importance, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nbetween the distress of my friends, and my poor auld country, ony wit\r\nthat ever I had may be said to have abandoned me, sae that I sometimes\r\nthink myself as ignorant as if I were _inter rusticos._ Here when I arise\r\nin the morning, wi\xc3\xad my mind just arranged touching what\xc3\xads to be done in\r\npuir Effie\xc3\xads misfortune, and hae gotten the haill statute at my\r\nfinger-ends, the mob maun get up and string Jock Porteous to a dyester\xc3\xads\r\nbeam, and ding a\xc3\xad thing out of my head again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeeply as he was distressed with his own domestic calamity, Deans could\r\nnot help expressing some interest in the news. Saddletree immediately\r\nentered on details of the insurrection and its consequences, while Butler\r\ntook the occasion to seek some private conversation with Jeanie Deans.\r\nShe gave him the opportunity he sought, by leaving the room, as if in\r\nprosecution of some part of her morning labour. Butler followed her in a\r\nfew minutes, leaving Deans so closely engaged by his busy visitor, that\r\nthere was little chance of his observing their absence.\r\n\r\nThe scene of their interview was an outer apartment, where Jeanie was\r\nused to busy herself in arranging the productions of her dairy. When\r\nButler found an opportunity of stealing after her into this place, he\r\nfound her silent, dejected, and ready to burst into tears. Instead of the\r\nactive industry with which she had been accustomed, even while in the act\r\nof speaking, to employ her hands in some useful branch of household\r\nbusiness, she was seated listless in a corner, sinking apparently under\r\nthe weight of her own thoughts. Yet the instant he entered, she dried her\r\neyes, and, with the simplicity and openness of her character, immediately\r\nentered on conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you have come in, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cfor--for--for I\r\nwished to tell ye, that all maun be ended between you and me--it\xc3\xads best\r\nfor baith our sakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnded!\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, in surprise; \xe2\x80\x9cand for what should it be ended?--I\r\ngrant this is a heavy dispensation, but it lies neither at your door nor\r\nmine--it\xc3\xads an evil of God\xc3\xads sending, and it must be borne; but it cannot\r\nbreak plighted troth, Jeanie, while they that plighted their word wish to\r\nkeep it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, looking at him affectionately, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nken weel that ye think mair of me than yourself; and, Reuben, I can only\r\nin requital think mair of your weal than of my ain. Ye are a man of\r\nspotless name, bred to God\xc3\xads ministry, and a\xc3\xad men say that ye will some\r\nday rise high in the kirk, though poverty keep ye doun e\xc3\xaden now. Poverty\r\nis a bad back-friend, Reuben, and that ye ken ower weel; but ill-fame is\r\na waur ane, and that is a truth ye sall never learn through my means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, eagerly and impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cor how do you\r\nconnect your sister\xc3\xads guilt, if guilt there be, which, I trust in God,\r\nmay yet be disproved, with our engagement?--how can that affect you or\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask me that, Mr. Butler? Will this stain, d\xc3\xadye think, ever\r\nbe forgotten, as lang as our heads are abune the grund? Will it not stick\r\nto us, and to our bairns, and to their very bairns\xc3\xad bairns? To hae been\r\nthe child of an honest man, might hae been saying something for me and\r\nmine; but to be the sister of a--O my God!\xe2\x80\x9d--With this exclamation her\r\nresolution failed, and she burst into a passionate fit of tears.\r\n\r\nThe lover used every effort to induce her to compose herself, and at\r\nlength succeeded; but she only resumed her composure to express herself\r\nwith the same positiveness as before. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Reuben, I\xc3\xadll bring disgrace\r\nhame to nae man\xc3\xads hearth; my ain distresses I can bear, and I maun bear,\r\nbut there is nae occasion for buckling them on other folk\xc3\xads shouthers. I\r\nwill bear my load alone--the back is made for the burden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA lover is by charter wayward and suspicious; and Jeanie\xc3\xads readiness to\r\nrenounce their engagement, under pretence of zeal for his peace of mind\r\nand respectability of character, seemed to poor Butler to form a\r\nportentous combination with the commission of the stranger he had met\r\nwith that morning. His voice faltered as he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether nothing but a\r\nsense of her sister\xc3\xads present distress occasioned her to talk in that\r\nmanner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what else can do sae?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with simplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not ten\r\nlong years since we spoke together in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen years!\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads a long time--sufficient perhaps for a\r\nwoman to weary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo weary of her auld gown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cand to wish for a new ane if\r\nshe likes to be brave, but not long enough to weary of a friend--The eye\r\nmay wish change, but the heart never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d said Reuben,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xc3\xads a bold promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not more bauld than true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, with the same quiet\r\nsimplicity which attended her manner in joy and grief in ordinary\r\naffairs, and in those which most interested her feelings.\r\n\r\nButler paused, and looking at her fixedly--\xe2\x80\x9cI am charged,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith\r\na message to you, Jeanie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! From whom? Or what can ony ane have to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is from a stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, affecting to speak with an\r\nindifference which his voice belied--\xe2\x80\x9cA young man whom I met this morning\r\nin the Park.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cand what did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he did not see you at the hour he expected, but required you should\r\nmeet him alone at Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn this night, so soon as the moon rises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall certainly come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, his suspicions increasing at the ready alacrity\r\nof the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cwho this man is to whom you are so willing to give the\r\nmeeting at a place and hour so uncommon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolk maun do muckle they have little will to do, in this world,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nJeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted,\xe2\x80\x9d said her lover; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what compels you to this?--who is this\r\nperson? What I saw of him was not very favourable--who, or what is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie, composedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know!\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, stepping impatiently through the\r\napartment--\xe2\x80\x9cYou purpose to meet a young man whom you do not know, at\r\nsuch a time, and in a place so lonely--you say you are compelled to do\r\nthis--and yet you say you do not know the person who exercises such an\r\ninfluence over you!--Jeanie, what am I to think of this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink only, Reuben, that I speak truth, as if I were to answer at the\r\nlast day.--I do not ken this man--I do not even ken that I ever saw him;\r\nand yet I must give him the meeting he asks--there\xc3\xads life and death upon\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not tell your father, or take him with you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no permission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let _me_ go with you? I will wait in the Park till nightfall,\r\nand join you when you set out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cthere maunna be mortal creature within\r\nhearing of our conference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you considered well the nature of what you are going to do?--the\r\ntime--the place--an unknown and suspicious character?--Why, if he had\r\nasked to see you in this house, your father sitting in the next room, and\r\nwithin call, at such an hour, you should have refused to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy weird maun be fulfilled, Mr. Butler; my life and my safety are in\r\nGod\xc3\xads hands, but I\xc3\xadll not spare to risk either of them on the errand I am\r\ngaun to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, much displeased, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must indeed break short\r\noff, and bid farewell. When there can be no confidence betwixt a man and\r\nhis plighted wife on such a momentous topic, it is a sign that she has no\r\nlonger the regard for him that makes their engagement safe and suitable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie looked at him and sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I had\r\nbrought myself to bear this parting--but--but--I did not ken that we were\r\nto part in unkindness. But I am a woman and you are a man--it may be\r\ndifferent wi\xc3\xad you--if your mind is made easier by thinking sae hardly of\r\nme, I would not ask you to think otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you have always been--wiser, better, and\r\nless selfish in your native feelings, than I can be, with all the helps\r\nphilosophy can give to a Christian--But why--why will you persevere in an\r\nundertaking so desperate? Why will you not let me be your assistant--your\r\nprotector, or at least your adviser?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust because I cannot, and I dare not,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut hark,\r\nwhat\xc3\xads that? Surely my father is no weel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, the voices in the next room became obstreperously loud of a\r\nsudden, the cause of which vociferation it is necessary to explain before\r\nwe go farther.\r\n\r\nWhen Jeanie and Butler retired, Mr. Saddletree entered upon the business\r\nwhich chiefly interested the family. In the commencement of their\r\nconversation he found old Deans, who in his usual state of mind, was no\r\ngranter of propositions, so much subdued by a deep sense of his\r\ndaughter\xc3\xads danger and disgrace, that he heard without replying to, or\r\nperhaps without understanding, one or two learned disquisitions on the\r\nnature of the crime imputed to her charge, and on the steps which ought\r\nto be taken in consequence. His only answer at each pause was, \xe2\x80\x9cI am no\r\nmisdoubting that you wuss us weel--your wife\xc3\xads our far-awa cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEncouraged by these symptoms of acquiescence, Saddletree, who, as an\r\namateur of the law, had a supreme deference for all constituted\r\nauthorities, again recurred to his other topic of interest, the murder,\r\nnamely, of Porteous, and pronounced a severe censure on the parties\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are kittle times--kittle times, Mr. Deans, when the people take\r\nthe power of life and death out of the hands of the rightful magistrate\r\ninto their ain rough grip. I am of opinion, and so I believe will Mr.\r\nCrossmyloof and the Privy Council, that this rising in effeir of war, to\r\ntake away the life of a reprieved man, will prove little better than\r\nperduellion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadna that on my mind whilk is ill to bear, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDeans, \xe2\x80\x9cI wad make bold to dispute that point wi\xc3\xad you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you dispute what\xc3\xads plain law, man?\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, somewhat\r\ncontemptuously; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads no a callant that e\xc3\xader carried a pock wi\xc3\xad a\r\nprocess in\xc3\xadt, but will tell you that perduellion is the warst and maist\r\nvirulent kind of treason, being an open convocating of the king\xc3\xads lieges\r\nagainst his authority (mair especially in arms, and by touk of drum, to\r\nbaith whilk accessories my een and lugs bore witness), and muckle worse\r\nthan lese-majesty, or the concealment of a treasonable purpose--It winna\r\nbear a dispute, neighbour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it will, though,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Douce Davie Deans; \xe2\x80\x9cI tell ye it will\r\nbear a disputer never like your cauld, legal, formal doctrines, neighbour\r\nSaddletree. I haud unco little by the Parliament House, since the awfu\xc3\xad\r\ndownfall of the hopes of honest folk that followed the Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what wad ye hae had, Mr. Deans?\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, impatiently;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdidna ye get baith liberty and conscience made fast, and settled by\r\ntailzie on you and your heirs for ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Deans, \xe2\x80\x9cI ken ye are one of those that are\r\nwise after the manner of this world, and that ye hand your part, and cast\r\nin your portion, wi\xc3\xad the lang heads and lang gowns, and keep with the\r\nsmart witty-pated lawyers of this our land--Weary on the dark and dolefu\xc3\xad\r\ncast that they hae gien this unhappy kingdom, when their black hands of\r\ndefection were clasped in the red hands of our sworn murtherers: when\r\nthose who had numbered the towers of our Zion, and marked the bulwarks of\r\nReformation, saw their hope turn into a snare, and their rejoicing into\r\nweeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna understand this, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Saddletree. \xe2\x80\x9cI am an\r\nhonest Presbyterian of the Kirk of Scotland, and stand by her and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and the due administration of justice by the fifteen\r\nLords o\xc3\xad Session and the five Lords o\xc3\xad Justiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut upon ye, Mr. Saddletree!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed David, who, in an opportunity of\r\ngiving his testimony on the offences and backslidings of the land, forgot\r\nfor a moment his own domestic calamity--\xe2\x80\x9cout upon your General Assembly,\r\nand the back of my hand to your Court o\xc3\xad Session!--What is the tane but a\r\nwaefu\xc3\xad bunch o\xc3\xad cauldrife professors and ministers, that sate bien and\r\nwarm when the persecuted remnant were warstling wi\xc3\xad hunger, and cauld,\r\nand fear of death, and danger of fire and sword upon wet brae-sides,\r\npeat-haggs, and flow-mosses, and that now creep out of their holes, like\r\nbluebottle flees in a blink of sunshine, to take the pu\xc3\xadpits and places\r\nof better folk--of them that witnessed, and testified, and fought, and\r\nendured pit, prison-house, and transportation beyond seas?--A bonny bike\r\nthere\xc3\xads o\xc3\xad them!--And for your Court o\xc3\xad Session--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may say what ye will o\xc3\xad the General Assembly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree,\r\ninterrupting him, \xe2\x80\x9cand let them clear them that kens them; but as for the\r\nLords o\xc3\xad Session, forby that they are my next-door neighbours, I would\r\nhave ye ken, for your ain regulation, that to raise scandal anent them,\r\nwhilk is termed to _murmur_ again them, is a crime _sui generis,_--_sui\r\ngeneris,_ Mr. Deans--ken ye what that amounts to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ken little o\xc3\xad the language of Antichrist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Deans; \xe2\x80\x9cand I care\r\nless than little what carnal courts may call the speeches of honest men.\r\nAnd as to murmur again them, it\xc3\xads what a\xc3\xad the folk that loses their\r\npleas, and nine-tenths o\xc3\xad them that win them, will be gey sure to be\r\nguilty in. Sae I wad hae ye ken that I hand a\xc3\xad your gleg-tongued\r\nadvocates, that sell their knowledge for pieces of silver--and your\r\nworldly-wise judges, that will gie three days of hearing in presence to a\r\ndebate about the peeling of an ingan, and no ae half-hour to the gospel\r\ntestimony--as legalists and formalists, countenancing by sentences, and\r\nquirks, and cunning terms of law, the late begun courses of national\r\ndefections--union, toleration, patronages, and Yerastian prelatic oaths.\r\nAs for the soul and body-killing Court o\xc3\xad Justiciary--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe habit of considering his life as dedicated to bear testimony in\r\nbehalf of what he deemed the suffering and deserted cause of true\r\nreligion, had swept honest David along with it thus far; but with the\r\nmention of the criminal court, the recollection of the disastrous\r\ncondition of his daughter rushed at once on his mind; he stopped short in\r\nthe midst of his triumphant declamation, pressed his hands against his\r\nforehead, and remained silent.\r\n\r\nSaddletree was somewhat moved, but apparently not so much so as to induce\r\nhim to relinquish the privilege of prosing in his turn afforded him by\r\nDavid\xc3\xads sudden silence. \xe2\x80\x9cNae doubt, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xc3\xads a sair\r\nthing to hae to do wi\xc3\xad courts of law, unless it be to improve ane\xc3\xads\r\nknowledge and practique, by waiting on as a hearer; and touching this\r\nunhappy affair of Effie--ye\xc3\xadll hae seen the dittay, doubtless?\xe2\x80\x9d He dragged\r\nout of his pocket a bundle of papers, and began to turn them over. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nis no it--this is the information of Mungo Marsport, of that ilk, against\r\nCaptain Lackland, for coming on his lands of Marsport with hawks, hounds,\r\nlying-dogs, nets, guns, cross-bows, hagbuts of found, or other engines\r\nmore or less for destruction of game, sic as red-deer, fallow-deer,\r\ncappercailzies, grey-fowl, moor-fowl, paitricks, herons, and sic like;\r\nhe, the said defender not being ane qualified person, in terms of the\r\nstatute sixteen hundred and twenty-ane; that is, not having ane\r\nplough-gate of land. Now, the defences proponed say, that _non constat_\r\nat this present what is a plough-gate of land, whilk uncertainty is\r\nsufficient to elide the conclusions of the libel. But then the answers to\r\nthe defences (they are signed by Mr. Crossmyloof, but Mr. Younglad drew\r\nthem), they propone, that it signifies naething, _in hoc statu,_ what or\r\nhow muckle a plough-gate of land may be, in respect the defender has nae\r\nlands whatsoever, less or mair. \xc3\xabSae grant a plough-gate\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d (here\r\nSaddletree read from the paper in his hand) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabto be less than the\r\nnineteenth part of a guse\xc3\xads grass\xc3\xad--(I trow Mr. Crossmyloof put in\r\nthat--I ken his style),--\xc3\xabof a guse\xc3\xads grass, what the better\r\nwill the defender be, seeing he hasna a divot-cast of land in\r\nScotland?--_Advocatus_ for Lackland duplies, that _nihil interest de\r\npossessione,_ the pursuer must put his case under the statute\xc3\xad--(now,\r\nthis is worth your notice, neighbour),--\xc3\xaband must show, _formaliter et\r\nspecialiter,_ as well as _generaliter,_ what is the qualification that\r\ndefender Lackland does _not_ possess--let him tell me what a plough-gate\r\nof land is, and I\xc3\xadll tell him if I have one or no. Surely the pursuer is\r\nbound to understand his own libel, and his own statute that he founds\r\nupon. _Titius_ pursues _Maevius_ for recovery of ane _black_ horse lent\r\nto Maevius--surely he shall have judgment; but if Titius pursue Maevius\r\nfor ane _scarlet_ or _crimson_ horse, doubtless he shall be bound to\r\nshow that there is sic ane animal _in rerum natura._ No man can be bound\r\nto plead to nonsense--that is to say, to a charge which cannot be\r\nexplained or understood\xc3\xad--(he\xc3\xads wrang there--the better the pleadings\r\nthe fewer understand them),--\xc3\xaband so the reference unto this undefined\r\nand unintelligible measure of land is, as if a penalty was inflicted by\r\nstatute for any man who suld hunt or hawk, or use lying-dogs, and\r\nwearing a sky-blue pair of breeches, without having--\xc3\xabBut I am wearying\r\nyou, Mr. Deans,--we\xc3\xadll pass to your ain business,--though this cue of\r\nMarsport against Lackland has made an unco din in the Outer House. Weel,\r\nhere\xc3\xads the dittay against puir Effie: \xc3\xabWhereas it is humbly meant and\r\nshown to us,\xc3\xad etc. (they are words of mere style), \xc3\xabthat whereas, by the\r\nlaws of this and every other well-regulated realm, the murder of any\r\none, more especially of an infant child, is a crime of ane high nature,\r\nand severely punishable: And whereas, without prejudice to the foresaid\r\ngenerality, it was, by ane act made in the second session of the First\r\nParliament of our most High and Dread Sovereigns William and Mary,\r\nespecially enacted, that ane woman who shall have concealed her\r\ncondition, and shall not be able to show that she hath called for help\r\nat the birth in case that the child shall be found dead or amissing,\r\nshall be deemed and held guilty of the murder thereof; and the said\r\nfacts of concealment and pregnancy being found proven or confessed,\r\nshall sustain the pains of law accordingly; yet, nevertheless, you,\r\nEffie, or Euphemia Deans--\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead no farther!\xe2\x80\x9d said Deans, raising his head up; \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather ye\r\nthrust a sword into my heart than read a word farther!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it wad hae comforted ye to\r\nken the best and the warst o\xc3\xadt. But the question is, what\xc3\xads to be dune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Deans firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to abide the dispensation that the\r\nLord sees meet to send us. Oh, if it had been His will to take the grey\r\nhead to rest before this awful visitation on my house and name! But His\r\nwill be done. I can say that yet, though I can say little mair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cye\xc3\xadll retain advocates for the puir\r\nlassie? it\xc3\xads a thing maun needs be thought of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there was ae man of them,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Deans, \xe2\x80\x9cthat held fast his\r\nintegrity--but I ken them weel, they are a\xc3\xad carnal, crafty, and\r\nwarld-hunting self-seekers, Yerastians, and Arminians, every ane o\xc3\xad\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout tout, neighbour, ye mauna take the warld at its word,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSaddletree; \xe2\x80\x9cthe very deil is no sae ill as he\xc3\xads ca\xc3\xadd; and I ken mair\r\nthan ae advocate that may be said to hae some integrity as weel as their\r\nneighbours; that is, after a sort o\xc3\xad fashion\xc3\xad o\xc3\xad their ain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed but a fashion of integrity that ye will find amang them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied David Deans, \xe2\x80\x9cand a fashion of wisdom, and fashion of carnal\r\nlearning--gazing, glancing-glasses they are, fit only to fling the glaiks\r\nin folk\xc3\xads een, wi\xc3\xad their pawky policy, and earthly ingine, their flights\r\nand refinements, and periods of eloquence, frae heathen emperors and\r\npopish canons. They canna, in that daft trash ye were reading to me, sae\r\nmuckle as ca\xc3\xad men that are sae ill-starred as to be amang their hands, by\r\nony name o\xc3\xad the dispensation o\xc3\xad grace, but maun new baptize them by the\r\nnames of the accursed Titus, wha was made the instrument of burning the\r\nholy Temple, and other sic like heathens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads Tishius,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cand no Titus. Mr. Crossmyloof\r\ncares as little about Titus or the Latin as ye do.--But it\xc3\xads a case\r\nof necessity--she maun hae counsel. Now, I could speak to Mr.\r\nCrossmyloof--he\xc3\xads weel ken\xc3\xadd for a round-spun Presbyterian, and\r\na ruling elder to boot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads a rank Yerastian,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Deans; \xe2\x80\x9cone of the public and\r\npolititious warldly-wise men that stude up to prevent ane general owning\r\nof the cause in the day of power!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat say ye to the auld Laird of Cuffabout?\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree; \xe2\x80\x9che whiles\r\nthumps the dust out of a case gey and well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe? the fause loon!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Deans--\xe2\x80\x9che was in his bandaliers to hae\r\njoined the ungracious Highlanders in 1715, an they had ever had the luck\r\nto cross the Firth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, Arniston? there\xc3\xads a clever chield for ye!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartoline,\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, to bring popish medals in till their very library from that\r\nschismatic woman in the north, the Duchess of Gordon.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* [James Dundas younger of Arniston was tried in the year 1711 upon\r\ncharge of leasing-making, in having presented, from the Duchess of\r\nGordon, medal of the Pretender, for the purpose, it was said, of\r\naffronting Queen Anne.]\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cWeel, weel, but somebody ye maun hae--What think ye o\xc3\xad Kittlepunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads an Arminian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoodsetter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads, I doubt, a Cocceian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAuld Whilliewhaw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads ony thing ye like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Naemmo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads naething at a\xc3\xad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xc3\xadre ill to please, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree: \xe2\x80\x9cI hae run ower the\r\npick o\xc3\xad them for you, ye maun e\xc3\xaden choose for yoursell; but bethink ye\r\nthat in the multitude of counsellors there\xc3\xads safety--What say ye to try\r\nyoung Mackenyie? he has a\xc3\xad his uncle\xc3\xads Practiques at the tongue\xc3\xads end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, sir, wad ye speak to me,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sturdy Presbyterian in\r\nexcessive wrath, \xe2\x80\x9cabout a man that has the blood of the saints at his\r\nfingers\xc3\xad ends? Did na his eme [Uncle] die and gang to his place wi\xc3\xad the\r\nname of the Bluidy Mackenyie? and winna he be kend by that name sae lang\r\nas there\xc3\xads a Scots tongue to speak the word? If the life of the dear\r\nbairn that\xc3\xads under a suffering dispensation, and Jeanie\xc3\xads, and my ain,\r\nand a\xc3\xad mankind\xc3\xads, depended on my asking sic a slave o\xc3\xad Satan to speak a\r\nword for me or them, they should a\xc3\xad gae doun the water thegither for\r\nDavie Deans!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the exalted tone in which he spoke this last sentence that broke\r\nup the conversation between Butler and Jeanie, and brought them both \xe2\x80\x9cben\r\nthe house,\xe2\x80\x9d to use the language of the country. Here they found the poor\r\nold man half frantic between grief and zealous ire against Saddletree\xc3\xads\r\nproposed measures, his cheek inflamed, his hand clenched, and his voice\r\nraised, while the tear in his eye, and the occasional quiver of his\r\naccents, showed that his utmost efforts were inadequate to shaking off\r\nthe consciousness of his misery. Butler, apprehensive of the consequences\r\nof his agitation to an aged and feeble frame, ventured to utter to him a\r\nrecommendation to patience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ patient,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man sternly,--\xe2\x80\x9cmore patient than any\r\none who is alive to the woeful backslidings of a miserable time can be\r\npatient; and in so much, that I need neither sectarians, nor sons nor\r\ngrandsons of sectarians, to instruct my grey hairs how to bear my cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Butler, taking no offence at the slur cast on his\r\ngrandfather\xc3\xads faith, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must use human means. When you call in a\r\nphysician, you would not, I suppose, question him on the nature of his\r\nreligious principles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWad I _no?_\xe2\x80\x9d answered David--\xe2\x80\x9cbut I wad, though; and if he didna satisfy\r\nme that he had a right sense of the right hand and left hand defections\r\nof the day, not a goutte of his physic should gang through my father\xc3\xads\r\nson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is a dangerous thing to trust to an illustration. Butler had done so\r\nand miscarried; but, like a gallant soldier when his musket misses fire,\r\nhe stood his ground, and charged with the bayonet.--\xe2\x80\x9cThis is too rigid an\r\ninterpretation of your duty, sir. The sun shines, and the rain descends,\r\non the just and unjust, and they are placed together in life in\r\ncircumstances which frequently render intercourse between them\r\nindispensable, perhaps that the evil may have an opportunity of being\r\nconverted by the good, and perhaps, also, that the righteous might, among\r\nother trials, be subjected to that of occasional converse with the\r\nprofane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xc3\xadre a silly callant, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Deans, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your bits of\r\nargument. Can a man touch pitch and not be defiled? Or what think ye of\r\nthe brave and worthy champions of the Covenant, that wadna sae muckle as\r\nhear a minister speak, be his gifts and graces as they would, that hadna\r\nwitnessed against the enormities of the day? Nae lawyer shall ever speak\r\nfor me and mine that hasna concurred in the testimony of the scattered,\r\nyet lovely remnant, which abode in the clifts of the rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, and as if fatigued, both with the arguments and presence of\r\nhis guests, the old man arose, and seeming to bid them adieu with a\r\nmotion of his head and hand, went to shut himself up in his sleeping\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads thrawing his daughter\xc3\xads life awa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree to Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nhear him speak in that daft gate. Where will he ever get a Cameronian\r\nadvocate? Or wha ever heard of a lawyer\xc3\xads suffering either for ae\r\nreligion or another? The lassie\xc3\xads life is clean flung awa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of this debate, Dumbiedikes had arrived at the\r\ndoor, dismounted, hung the pony\xc3\xads bridle on the usual hook, and sunk down\r\non his ordinary settle. His eyes, with more than their usual animation,\r\nfollowed first one speaker then another, till he caught the melancholy\r\nsense of the whole from Saddletree\xc3\xads last words. He rose from his seat,\r\nstumped slowly across the room, and, coming close up to Saddletree\xc3\xads ear,\r\nsaid in a tremulous anxious voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWill--will siller do naething for\r\nthem, Mr. Saddletree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph!\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, looking grave,--\xe2\x80\x9csiller will certainly do it in\r\nthe Parliament House, if ony thing _can_ do it; but where\xc3\xads the siller to\r\ncome frae? Mr. Deans, ye see, will do naething; and though Mrs.\r\nSaddletree\xc3\xads their far-awa friend, and right good weel-wisher, and is\r\nweel disposed to assist, yet she wadna like to stand to be bound _singuli\r\nin solidum_ to such an expensive wark. An ilka friend wad bear a share o\xc3\xad\r\nthe burden, something might be dune--ilka ane to be liable for their ain\r\ninput--I wadna like to see the case fa\xc3\xad through without being pled--it\r\nwadna be creditable, for a\xc3\xad that daft whig body says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll--I will--yes\xe2\x80\x9d (assuming fortitude), \xe2\x80\x9cI will be answerable,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDumbiedikes, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a score of punds sterling.\xe2\x80\x9d--And he was silent, staring\r\nin astonishment at finding himself capable of such unwonted resolution\r\nand excessive generosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty bless ye, Laird!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, in a transport of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may ca\xc3\xad the twenty punds thretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes, looking\r\nbashfully away from her, and towards Saddletree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do bravely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, rubbing his hands; \xe2\x80\x9cand ye sall\r\nhae a\xc3\xad my skill and knowledge to gar the siller gang far--I\xc3\xadll tape it\r\nout weel--I ken how to gar the birkies tak short fees, and be glad o\xc3\xad\r\nthem too--it\xc3\xads only garring them trow ye hae twa or three cases of\r\nimportance coming on, and they\xc3\xadll work cheap to get custom. Let me alane\r\nfor whilly-whaing an advocate:--it\xc3\xads nae sin to get as muckle flue them\r\nfor our siller as we can--after a\xc3\xad, it\xc3\xads but the wind o\xc3\xad their mouth--it\r\ncosts them naething; whereas, in my wretched occupation of a saddler,\r\nhorse milliner, and harness maker, we are out unconscionable sums just\r\nfor barkened hides and leather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be of no use?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cMy means, alas! are only worth the\r\nblack coat I wear; but I am young--I owe much to the family--Can I do\r\nnothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe can help to collect evidence, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree; \xe2\x80\x9cif we could but\r\nfind ony ane to say she had gien the least hint o\xc3\xad her condition, she wad\r\nbe brought aft wi\xc3\xad a wat finger--Mr. Crossmyloof tell\xc3\xadd me sae. The\r\ncrown, says he, canna be craved to prove a positive--was\xc3\xadt a positive or\r\na negative they couldna be ca\xc3\xadd to prove?--it was the tane or the tither\r\no\xc3\xad them, I am sure, and it maksna muckle matter whilk. Wherefore, says\r\nhe, the libel maun be redargued by the panel proving her defences. And it\r\ncanna be done otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the fact, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d argued Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that this poor girl has\r\nborne a child; surely the crown lawyers must prove that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler.\r\n\r\nSaddletree paused a moment, while the visage of Dumbiedikes, which\r\ntraversed, as if it had been placed on a pivot, from the one spokesman to\r\nthe other, assumed a more blithe expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe--ye--ye--es,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, after some grave hesitation;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cunquestionably that is a thing to be proved, as the court will more\r\nfully declare by an interlocutor of relevancy in common form; but I fancy\r\nthat job\xc3\xads done already, for she has confessed her guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfessed the murder?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Jeanie, with a scream that made them\r\nall start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didna say that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bartoline. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she confessed bearing the\r\nbabe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what became of it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cfor not a word could I get\r\nfrom her but bitter sighs and tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says it was taken away from her by the woman in whose house it was\r\nborn, and who assisted her at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who was that woman?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely by her means the truth\r\nmight be discovered.--Who was she? I will fly to her directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes, \xe2\x80\x9cI were as young and as supple as you, and\r\nhad the gift of the gab as weel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d again reiterated Butler impatiently.--\xe2\x80\x9cWho could that woman\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, wha kens that but herself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree; \xe2\x80\x9cshe deponed farther,\r\nand declined to answer that interrogatory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen to herself will I instantly go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cfarewell, Jeanie;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n then coming close up to her--\xe2\x80\x9cTake no _rash steps_ till you hear from me.\r\nFarewell!\xe2\x80\x9d and he immediately left the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wad gang too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landed proprietor, in an anxious, jealous, and\r\nrepining tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut my powny winna for the life o\xc3\xad me gang ony other road\r\nthan just frae Dumbiedikes to this house-end, and sae straight back\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYell do better for them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, as they left the house\r\ntogether, \xe2\x80\x9cby sending me the thretty punds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThretty punds!\xe2\x80\x9d hesitated Dumbiedikes, who was now out of the reach of\r\nthose eyes which had inflamed his generosity; \xe2\x80\x9cI only said _twenty_\r\npunds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was under protestation to add and eik;\r\nand so ye craved leave to amend your libel, and made it thretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I? I dinna mind that I did,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dumbiedikes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut whatever I\r\nsaid I\xc3\xadll stand to.\xe2\x80\x9d Then bestriding his steed with some difficulty, he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cDinna ye think poor Jeanie\xc3\xads een wi\xc3\xad the tears in them glanced\r\nlike lamour beads, Mr. Saddletree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kenna muckle about women\xc3\xads een, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the insensible\r\nBartoline; \xe2\x80\x9cand I care just as little. I wuss I were as weel free o\xc3\xad\r\ntheir tongues; though few wives,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, recollecting the necessity of\r\nkeeping up his character for domestic rule, \xe2\x80\x9care under better command\r\nthan mine, Laird. I allow neither perduellion nor lese-majesty against my\r\nsovereign authority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Laird saw nothing so important in this observation as to call for a\r\nrejoinder, and when they had exchanged a mute salutation, they parted in\r\npeace upon their different errands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELFTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                I\xc3\xadll warrant that fellow from drowning,\r\n                were the ship no stronger than a nut-shell.\r\n\r\n                                           The Tempest.\r\n\r\nButler felt neither fatigue nor want of refreshment, although, from the\r\nmode in which he had spent the night, he might well have been overcome\r\nwith either. But in the earnestness with which he hastened to the\r\nassistance of the sister of Jeanie Deans, he forgot both.\r\n\r\nIn his first progress he walked with so rapid a pace as almost approached\r\nto running, when he was surprised to hear behind him a call upon his\r\nname, contending with an asthmatic cough, and half-drowned amid the\r\nresounding trot of a Highland pony. He looked behind, and saw the Laird\r\nof Dumbiedikes making after him with what speed he might, for it\r\nhappened, fortunately for the Laird\xc3\xads purpose of conversing with Butler,\r\nthat his own road homeward was for about two hundred yards the same with\r\nthat which led by the nearest way to the city. Butler stopped when he\r\nheard himself thus summoned, internally wishing no good to the panting\r\nequestrian who thus retarded his journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh! uh! uh!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Dumbiedikes, as he checked the hobbling pace of\r\nthe pony by our friend Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cUh! uh! it\xc3\xads a hard-set willyard beast\r\nthis o\xc3\xad mine.\xe2\x80\x9d He had in fact just overtaken the object of his chase at\r\nthe very point beyond which it would have been absolutely impossible for\r\nhim to have continued the pursuit, since there Butler\xc3\xads road parted from\r\nthat leading to Dumbiedikes, and no means of influence or compulsion\r\nwhich the rider could possibly have used towards his Bucephalus could\r\nhave induced the Celtic obstinacy of Rory Bean (such was the pony\xc3\xads name)\r\nto have diverged a yard from the path that conducted him to his own\r\npaddock.\r\n\r\nEven when he had recovered from the shortness of breath occasioned by a\r\ntrot much more rapid than Rory or he were accustomed to, the high purpose\r\nof Dumbiedikes seemed to stick as it were in his throat, and impede his\r\nutterance, so that Butler stood for nearly three minutes ere he could\r\nutter a syllable; and when he did find voice, it was only to say, after\r\none or two efforts, \xe2\x80\x9cUh! uh! uhm! I say, Mr.--Mr. Butler, it\xc3\xads a braw day\r\nfor the har\xc3\xadst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine day, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you good morning, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay--stay a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Dumbiedikes; \xe2\x80\x9cthat was no what I had gotten\r\nto say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, pray be quick, and let me have your commands,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncrave your pardon, but I am in haste, and _Tempus nemini_--you know the\r\nproverb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDumbiedikes did not know the proverb, nor did he even take the trouble to\r\nendeavour to look as if he did, as others in his place might have done.\r\nHe was concentrating all his intellects for one grand proposition, and\r\ncould not afford any detachment to defend outposts. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he, \xe2\x80\x9cken ye if Mr. Saddletree\xc3\xads a great lawyer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no person\xc3\xads word for it but his own,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Butler, drily;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut undoubtedly he best understands his own qualities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the taciturn Dumbiedikes, in a tone which seemed to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Butler, I take your meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll\r\nemploy my ain man o\xc3\xad business, Nichil Novit (auld Nichil\xc3\xads son, and\r\namaist as gleg as his father), to agent Effie\xc3\xads plea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd having thus displayed more sagacity than Butler expected from him, he\r\ncourteously touched his gold-laced cocked hat, and by a punch on the\r\nribs, conveyed to Rory Bean, it was his rider\xc3\xads pleasure that he should\r\nforthwith proceed homewards; a hint which the quadruped obeyed with that\r\ndegree of alacrity with which men and animals interpret and obey\r\nsuggestions that entirely correspond with their own inclinations.\r\n\r\nButler resumed his pace, not without a momentary revival of that jealousy\r\nwhich the honest Laird\xc3\xads attention to the family of Deans had at\r\ndifferent times excited in his bosom. But he was too generous long to\r\nnurse any feeling which was allied to selfishness. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9crich in what I want; why should I feel vexed that he has the\r\nheart to dedicate some of his pelf to render them services, which I can\r\nonly form the empty wish of executing? In God\xc3\xads name, let us each do what\r\nwe can. May she be but happy!--saved from the misery and disgrace that\r\nseems impending--Let me but find the means of preventing the fearful\r\nexperiment of this evening, and farewell to other thoughts, though my\r\nheart-strings break in parting with them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe redoubled his pace, and soon stood before the door of the Tolbooth, or\r\nrather before the entrance where the door had formerly been placed. His\r\ninterview with the mysterious stranger, the message to Jeanie, his\r\nagitating conversation with her on the subject of breaking off their\r\nmutual engagements, and the interesting scene with old Deans, had so\r\nentirely occupied his mind as to drown even recollection of the tragical\r\nevent which he had witnessed the preceding evening. His attention was not\r\nrecalled to it by the groups who stood scattered on the street in\r\nconversation, which they hushed when strangers approached, or by the\r\nbustling search of the agents of the city police, supported by small\r\nparties of the military, or by the appearance of the Guard-House, before\r\nwhich were treble sentinels, or, finally, by the subdued and intimidated\r\nlooks of the lower orders of society, who, conscious that they were\r\nliable to suspicion, if they were not guilty of accession to a riot\r\nlikely to be strictly inquired into, glided about with an humble and\r\ndismayed aspect, like men whose spirits being exhausted in the revel and\r\nthe dangers of a desperate debauch over-night, are nerve-shaken,\r\ntimorous, and unenterprising on the succeeding day.\r\n\r\nNone of these symptoms of alarm and trepidation struck Butler, whose mind\r\nwas occupied with a different, and to him still more interesting subject,\r\nuntil he stood before the entrance to the prison, and saw it defended by\r\na double file of grenadiers, instead of bolts and bars. Their \xe2\x80\x9cStand,\r\nstand!\xe2\x80\x9d the blackened appearance of the doorless gateway, and the winding\r\nstaircase and apartments of the Tolbooth, now open to the public eye,\r\nrecalled the whole proceedings of the eventful night. Upon his requesting\r\nto speak with Effie Deans, the same tall, thin, silver-haired turnkey,\r\nwhom he had seen on the preceding evening, made his appearance,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied to Butler\xc3\xads request of admission, with true\r\nScottish indirectness, \xe2\x80\x9cye will be the same lad that was for in to see\r\nher yestreen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler admitted he was the same person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the turnkey, \xe2\x80\x9cthat ye speered at me when we\r\nlocked up, and if we locked up earlier on account of Porteous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely I might make some such observation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\nquestion now is, can I see Effie Deans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken--gang in by, and up the turnpike stair, and turn till the\r\nward on the left hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man followed close behind him, with his keys in his hand, not\r\nforgetting even that huge one which had once opened and shut the outward\r\ngate of his dominions, though at present it was but an idle and useless\r\nburden. No sooner had Butler entered the room to which he was directed,\r\nthan the experienced hand of the warder selected the proper key, and\r\nlocked it on the outside. At first Butler conceived this manoeuvre was\r\nonly an effect of the man\xc3\xads habitual and official caution and jealousy.\r\nBut when he heard the hoarse command, \xe2\x80\x9cTurn out the guard!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nimmediately afterwards heard the clash of a sentinel\xc3\xads arms, as he was\r\nposted at the door of his apartment, he again called out to the turnkey,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good friend, I have business of some consequence with Effie Deans,\r\nand I beg to see her as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d No answer was returned. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\r\nbe against your rules to admit me,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Butler, in a still louder\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cto see the prisoner, I beg you will tell me so, and let me go\r\nabout my business.--_Fugit irrevocabile tempus!_\xe2\x80\x9d muttered he to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ye had business to do, ye suld hae dune it before ye cam here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied the man of keys from the outside; \xe2\x80\x9cyell find it\xc3\xads easier wunnin\r\nin than wunnin out here--there\xc3\xads sma\xc3\xad likelihood o\xc3\xad another Porteous mob\r\ncoming to rabble us again--the law will haud her ain now, neighbour, and\r\nthat yell find to your cost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must mistake me\r\nfor some other person. My name is Reuben Butler, preacher of the gospel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ken that weel eneugh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if you know me, I have a right to know from you in return,\r\nwhat warrant you have for detaining me; that, I know, is the right of\r\nevery British subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarrant!\xe2\x80\x9d said the jailor,--\xe2\x80\x9cthe warrant\xc3\xads awa to Libberton wi\xc3\xad twa\r\nsheriff officers seeking ye. If ye had staid at hame, as honest men\r\nshould do, ye wad hae seen the warrant; but if ye come to be incarcerated\r\nof your ain accord, wha can help it, my jo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabSo I cannot see Effie Deans, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cand you are\r\ndetermined not to let me out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroth will I no, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man, doggedly; \xe2\x80\x9cas for\r\nEffie Deans, ye\xc3\xadll hae eneuch ado to mind your ain business, and let her\r\nmind hers; and for letting you out, that maun be as the magistrate will\r\ndetermine. And fare ye weel for a bit, for I maun see Deacon Sawyers put\r\non ane or twa o\xc3\xad the doors that your quiet folk broke down yesternight,\r\nMr. Butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in this exquisitely provoking, but there was also\r\nsomething darkly alarming. To be imprisoned, even on a false accusation,\r\nhas something in it disagreeable and menacing even to men of more\r\nconstitutional courage than Butler had to boast; for although he had much\r\nof that resolution which arises from a sense of duty and an honourable\r\ndesire to discharge it, yet, as his imagination was lively, and his frame\r\nof body delicate, he was far from possessing that cool insensibility to\r\ndanger which is the happy portion of men of stronger health, more firm\r\nnerves, and less acute sensibility. An indistinct idea of peril, which he\r\ncould neither understand nor ward off, seemed to float before his eyes.\r\nHe tried to think over the events of the preceding night, in hopes of\r\ndiscovering some means of explaining or vindicating his conduct for\r\nappearing among the mob, since it immediately occurred to him that his\r\ndetention must be founded on that circumstance. And it was with anxiety\r\nthat he found he could not recollect to have been under the observation\r\nof any disinterested witness in the attempts that he made from time to\r\ntime to expostulate with the rioters, and to prevail on them to release\r\nhim. The distress of Deans\xc3\xads family, the dangerous rendezvous which\r\nJeanie had formed, and which he could not now hope to interrupt, had also\r\ntheir share in his unpleasant reflections. Yet, impatient as he was to\r\nreceive an _e\xc3\xadclaircissement_ upon the cause of his confinement, and if\r\npossible to obtain his liberty, he was affected with a trepidation which\r\nseemed no good omen; when, after remaining an hour in this solitary\r\napartment, he received a summons to attend the sitting magistrate. He was\r\nconducted from prison strongly guarded by a party of soldiers, with a\r\nparade of precaution, that, however ill-timed and unnecessary, is\r\ngenerally displayed _after_ an event, which such precaution, if used in\r\ntime, might have prevented.\r\n\r\nHe was introduced into the Council Chamber, as the place is called where\r\nthe magistrates hold their sittings, and which was then at a little\r\ndistance from the prison. One or two of the senators of the city were\r\npresent, and seemed about to engage in the examination of an individual\r\nwho was brought forward to the foot of the long green-covered table round\r\nwhich the council usually assembled. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the preacher?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of\r\nthe magistrates, as the city officer in attendance introduced Butler. The\r\nman answered in the affirmative. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him sit down there for an instant;\r\nwe will finish this man\xc3\xads business very briefly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we remove Mr. Butler?\xe2\x80\x9d queried the assistant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not necessary--Let him remain where he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler accordingly sate down on a bench at the bottom of the apartment,\r\nattended by one of his keepers.\r\n\r\nIt was a large room, partially and imperfectly lighted; but by chance, or\r\nthe skill of the architect, who might happen to remember the advantage\r\nwhich might occasionally be derived from such an arrangement, one window\r\nwas so placed as to throw a strong light at the foot of the table at\r\nwhich prisoners were usually posted for examination, while the upper end,\r\nwhere the examinants sate, was thrown into shadow. Butler\xc3\xads eyes were\r\ninstantly fixed on the person whose examination was at present\r\nproceeding, in the idea that he might recognise some one of the\r\nconspirators of the former night. But though the features of this man\r\nwere sufficiently marked and striking, he could not recollect that he had\r\never seen them before.\r\n\r\nThe complexion of this person was dark, and his age somewhat advanced. He\r\nwore his own hair, combed smooth down, and cut very short. It was jet\r\nblack, slightly curled by nature, and already mottled with grey. The\r\nman\xc3\xads face expressed rather knavery than vice, and a disposition to\r\nsharpness, cunning, and roguery, more than the traces of stormy and\r\nindulged passions. His sharp quick black eyes, acute features, ready\r\nsardonic smile, promptitude and effrontery, gave him altogether what is\r\ncalled among the vulgar a _knowing_ look, which generally implies a\r\ntendency to knavery. At a fair or market, you could not for a moment have\r\ndoubted that he was a horse-jockey, intimate with all the tricks of his\r\ntrade; yet, had you met him on a moor, you would not have apprehended any\r\nviolence from him. His dress was also that of a horse-dealer--a\r\nclose-buttoned jockey-coat, or wrap-rascal, as it was then termed, with\r\nhuge metal buttons, coarse blue upper stockings, called boot-hose because\r\nsupplying the place of boots, and a slouched hat. He only wanted a loaded\r\nwhip under his arm and a spur upon one heel, to complete the dress of the\r\ncharacter he seemed to represent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name is James Ratcliffe?\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy--always wi\xc3\xad your honour\xc3\xads leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, you could find me another name if I did not like that\r\none?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty to pick and choose upon, always with your honour\xc3\xads leave,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n resumed the respondent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut James Ratcliffe is your present name?--what is your trade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna just say, distinctly, that I have what ye wad ca\xc3\xad preceesely a\r\ntrade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are your means of living--your\r\noccupation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout tout--your honour, wi\xc3\xad your leave, kens that as weel as I do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied the examined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, I want to hear you describe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the examinant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe describe!--and to your honour!--far be it from Jemmie Ratcliffe,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n responded the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, sir, no trifling--I insist on an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the declarant, \xe2\x80\x9cI maun make a clean breast, for ye\r\nsee, wi\xc3\xad your leave, I am looking for favour--Describe my occupation,\r\nquo\xc3\xad ye?--troth it will be ill to do that, in a feasible way, in a place\r\nlike this--but what is\xc3\xadt again that the aught command says?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt not steal,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure o\xc3\xad that?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the accused.--\xe2\x80\x9cTroth, then, my\r\noccupation, and that command, are sair at odds, for I read it, thou\r\n_shalt_ steal; and that makes an unco difference, though there\xc3\xads but a\r\nwee bit word left out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo cut the matter short, Ratcliffe, you have been a most notorious\r\nthief,\xe2\x80\x9d said the examinant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe Highlands and Lowlands ken that, sir, forby England and\r\nHolland,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ratcliffe, with the greatest composure and effrontery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what d\xc3\xadye think the end of your calling will be?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have gien a braw guess yesterday--but I dinna ken sae weel the\r\nday,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would you have said would have been your end, had you been\r\nasked the question yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the gallows,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ratcliffe, with the same composure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a daring rascal, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate; \xe2\x80\x9cand how dare you\r\nhope times are mended with you to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads muckle difference\r\nbetween lying in prison under sentence of death, and staying there of\r\nane\xc3\xads ain proper accord, when it would have cost a man naething to get up\r\nand rin awa--what was to hinder me from stepping out quietly, when the\r\nrabble walked awa wi\xc3\xad Jock Porteous yestreen?--and does your honour\r\nreally think I staid on purpose to be hanged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what you may have proposed to yourself; but I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the law proposes for you, and that is, to hang you\r\nnext Wednesday eight days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na, your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe firmly, \xe2\x80\x9ccraving your honour\xc3\xads\r\npardon, I\xc3\xadll ne\xc3\xader believe that till I see it. I have kend the law this\r\nmony a year, and mony a thrawart job I hae had wi\xc3\xad her first and last;\r\nbut the auld jaud is no sae ill as that comes to--I aye fand her bark\r\nwaur than her bite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you do not expect the gallows, to which you are condemned (for\r\nthe fourth time to my knowledge), may I beg the favour to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmagistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it is you _do_ expect, in consideration of your not\r\nhaving taken your flight with the rest of the jail-birds, which I will\r\nadmit was a line of conduct little to have been expected?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would never have thought for a moment of staying in that auld gousty\r\ntoom house,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that use and wont had just gien me\r\na fancy to the place, and I\xc3\xadm just expecting a bit post in\xc3\xadt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA post!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the magistrate; \xe2\x80\x9ca whipping-post, I suppose, you\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na, sir, I had nae thoughts o\xc3\xad a whuppin-post. After having been\r\nfour times doomed to hang by the neck till I was dead, I think I am far\r\nbeyond being whuppit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, in Heaven\xc3\xads name, what _did_ you expect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the post of under-turnkey, for I understand there\xc3\xads a vacancy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the prisoner; \xe2\x80\x9cI wadna think of asking the lockman\xc3\xads* place ower his\r\nhead; it wadna suit me sae weel as ither folk, for I never could put a\r\nbeast out o\xc3\xad the way, much less deal wi\xc3\xad a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Note H. Hangman, or Lockman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads something in your favour,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, making exactly\r\nthe inference to which Ratcliffe was desirous to lead him, though he\r\nmantled his art with an affectation of oddity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you think you can be trusted\r\nwith a charge in the prison, when you have broken at your own hand half\r\nthe jails in Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWi\xc3\xad your honour\xc3\xads leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cif I kend sae weel how to wun\r\nout mysell, it\xc3\xads like I wad be a\xc3\xad the better a hand to keep other folk\r\nin. I think they wad ken their business weel that held me in when I\r\nwanted to be out, or wan out when I wanted to hand them in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe remark seemed to strike the magistrate, but he made no further\r\nimmediate observation, only desired Ratcliffe to be removed.\r\n\r\nWhen this daring and yet sly freebooter was out of hearing, the\r\nmagistrate asked the city clerk, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat he thought of the fellow\xc3\xads\r\nassurance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads no for me to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the clerk; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if James Ratcliffe\r\nbe inclined to turn to good, there is not a man e\xc3\xader came within the\r\nports of the burgh could be of sae muckle use to the Good Town in the\r\nthief and lock-up line of business. I\xc3\xadll speak to Mr. Sharpitlaw about\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon Ratcliffe\xc3\xads retreat, Butler was placed at the table for examination.\r\nThe magistrate conducted his inquiry civilly, but yet in a manner which\r\ngave him to understand that he laboured under strong suspicion. With a\r\nfrankness which at once became his calling and character, Butler avowed\r\nhis involuntary presence at the murder of Porteous, and, at the request\r\nof the magistrate, entered into a minute detail of the circumstances\r\nwhich attended that unhappy affair. All the particulars, such as we have\r\nnarrated, were taken minutely down by the clerk from Butler\xc3\xads dictation.\r\n\r\nWhen the narrative was concluded, the cross-examination commenced, which\r\nit is a painful task even for the most candid witness to undergo, since a\r\nstory, especially if connected with agitating and alarming incidents, can\r\nscarce be so clearly and distinctly told, but that some ambiguity and\r\ndoubt may be thrown upon it by a string of successive and minute\r\ninterrogatories.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate commenced by observing, that Butler had said his object\r\nwas to return to the village of Libberton, but that he was interrupted by\r\nthe mob at the West Port. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the West Port your usual way of leaving\r\ntown when you go to Libberton?\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Butler, with the haste of a man anxious to\r\nvindicate the accuracy of his evidence; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I chanced to be nearer that\r\nport than any other, and the hour of shutting the gates was on the point\r\nof striking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was unlucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, drily. \xe2\x80\x9cPray, being, as you say,\r\nunder coercion and fear of the lawless multitude, and compelled to\r\naccompany them through scenes disagreeable to all men of humanity, and\r\nmore especially irreconcilable to the profession of a minister, did you\r\nnot attempt to struggle, resist, or escape from their violence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat their numbers prevented him from attempting\r\nresistance, and their vigilance from effecting his escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was unlucky,\xe2\x80\x9d again repeated the magistrate, in the same dry\r\ninacquiescent tone of voice and manner. He proceeded with decency and\r\npoliteness, but with a stiffness which argued his continued suspicion, to\r\nask many questions concerning the behaviour of the mob, the manners and\r\ndress of the ringleaders; and when he conceived that the caution of\r\nButler, if he was deceiving him, must be lulled asleep, the magistrate\r\nsuddenly and artfully returned to former parts of his declaration, and\r\nrequired a new recapitulation of the circumstances, to the minutest and\r\nmost trivial point, which attended each part of the melancholy scene. No\r\nconfusion or contradiction, however, occurred, that could countenance the\r\nsuspicion which he seemed to have adopted against Butler. At length the\r\ntrain of his interrogatories reached Madge Wildfire, at whose name the\r\nmagistrate and town-clerk exchanged significant glances. If the fate of\r\nthe Good Town had depended on her careful magistrate\xc3\xads knowing the\r\nfeatures and dress of this personage, his inquiries could not have been\r\nmore particular. But Butler could say almost nothing of this person\xc3\xads\r\nfeatures, which were disguised apparently with red paint and soot, like\r\nan Indian going to battle, besides the projecting shade of a curch, or\r\ncoif, which muffled the hair of the supposed female. He declared that he\r\nthought he could not know this Madge Wildfire, if placed before him in a\r\ndifferent dress, but that he believed he might recognise her voice.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate requested him again to state by what gate he left the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Cowgate Port,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that the nearest road to Libberton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Butler, with embarrassment; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was the nearest way to\r\nextricate myself from the mob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clerk and magistrate again exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the Cowgate Port a nearer way to Libberton from the Grassmarket than\r\nBristo Port?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I had to visit a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the interrogator--\xe2\x80\x9cYou were in a hurry to tell the sight\r\nyou had witnessed, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I was not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cnor did I speak on the subject the\r\nwhole time I was at St. Leonard\xc3\xads Crags.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich road did you take to St. Leonard\xc3\xads Crags?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the foot of Salisbury Crags,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? you seem partial to circuitous routes,\xe2\x80\x9d again said the\r\nmagistrate. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom did you see after you left the city?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne by one he obtained a description of every one of the groups who had\r\npassed Butler, as already noticed, their number, demeanour, and\r\nappearance; and, at length, came to the circumstance of the mysterious\r\nstranger in the King\xc3\xads Park. On this subject Butler would fain have\r\nremained silent, But the magistrate had no sooner got a slight hint\r\nconcerning the incident, than he seemed bent to possess himself of the\r\nmost minute particulars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook ye, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a young man, and bear an\r\nexcellent character; so much I will myself testify in your favour. But we\r\nare aware there has been, at times, a sort of bastard and fiery zeal in\r\nsome of your order, and those, men irreproachable in other points, which\r\nhas led them into doing and countenancing great irregularities, by which\r\nthe peace of the country is liable to be shaken.--I will deal plainly\r\nwith you. I am not at all satisfied with this story, of your setting out\r\nagain and again to seek your dwelling by two several roads, which were\r\nboth circuitous. And, to be frank, no one whom we have examined on this\r\nunhappy affair could trace in your appearance any thing like your acting\r\nunder compulsion. Moreover, the waiters at the Cowgate Port observed\r\nsomething like the trepidation of guilt in your conduct, and declare that\r\nyou were the first to command them to open the gate, in a tone of\r\nauthority, as if still presiding over the guards and out-posts of the\r\nrabble, who had besieged them the whole night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cI only asked free passage for myself;\r\nthey must have much misunderstood, if they did not wilfully misrepresent\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cI am inclined to judge the\r\nbest and hope the best, as I am sure I wish the best; but you must be\r\nfrank with me, if you wish to secure my good opinion, and lessen the risk\r\nof inconvenience to yourself. You have allowed you saw another individual\r\nin your passage through the King\xc3\xads Park to Saint Leonard\xc3\xads Crags--I must\r\nknow every word which passed betwixt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus closely pressed, Butler, who had no reason for concealing what\r\npassed at that meeting, unless because Jeanie Deans was concerned in it,\r\nthought it best to tell the whole truth from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, pausing, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the young woman\r\nwill accept an invitation so mysterious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear she will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you use the word _fear_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am apprehensive for her safety, in meeting at such a time and\r\nplace, one who had something of the manner of a desperado, and whose\r\nmessage was of a character so inexplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer safety shall be cared for,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Butler, I am\r\nconcerned I cannot immediately discharge you from confinement, but I hope\r\nyou will not be long detained.--Remove Mr. Butler, and let him be\r\nprovided with decent accommodation in all respects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was conducted back to the prison accordingly; but, in the food offered\r\nto him, as well as in the apartment in which he was lodged, the\r\nrecommendation of the magistrate was strictly attended to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Dark and eerie was the night,\r\n                        And lonely was the way,\r\n                    As Janet, wi\xc3\xad her green mantell,\r\n                       To Miles\xc3\xad Cross she did gae.\r\n                                          Old Ballad.\r\n\r\nLeaving Butler to all the uncomfortable thoughts attached to his new\r\nsituation, among which the most predominant was his feeling that he was,\r\nby his confinement, deprived of all possibility of assisting the family\r\nat St. Leonard\xc3\xads in their greatest need, we return to Jeanie Deans, who\r\nhad seen him depart, without an opportunity of farther explanation, in\r\nall that agony of mind with which the female heart bids adieu to the\r\ncomplicated sensations so well described by Coleridge,--\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Hopes, and fears that kindle hope,\r\n                     An undistinguishable throng;\r\n                    And gentle wishes long subdued--\r\n                      Subdued and cherished long.\r\n\r\nIt is not the firmest heart (and Jeanie, under her russet rokelay, had\r\none that would not have disgraced Cato\xc3\xads daughter) that can most easily\r\nbid adieu to these soft and mingled emotions. She wept for a few minutes\r\nbitterly, and without attempting to refrain from this indulgence of\r\npassion. But a moment\xc3\xads recollection induced her to check herself for a\r\ngrief selfish and proper to her own affections, while her father and\r\nsister were plunged into such deep and irretrievable affliction. She drew\r\nfrom her pocket the letter which had been that morning flung into her\r\napartment through an open window, and the contents of which were as\r\nsingular as the expression was violent and energetic. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she would save\r\na human being from the most damning guilt, and all its desperate\r\nconsequences,--if she desired the life an honour of her sister to be\r\nsaved from the bloody fangs of an unjust law,--if she desired not to\r\nforfeit peace of mind here, and happiness hereafter,\xe2\x80\x9d such was the\r\nfrantic style of the conjuration, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was entreated to give a sure,\r\nsecret, and solitary meeting to the writer. She alone could rescue him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n so ran the letter, \xe2\x80\x9cand he only could rescue her.\xe2\x80\x9d He was in such\r\ncircumstances, the billet farther informed her, that an attempt to bring\r\nany witness of their conference, or even to mention to her father, or any\r\nother person whatsoever, the letter which requested it, would inevitably\r\nprevent its taking place, and ensure the destruction of her sister. The\r\nletter concluded with incoherent but violent protestations, that in\r\nobeying this summons she had nothing to fear personally.\r\n\r\nThe message delivered to her by Butler from the stranger in the Park\r\ntallied exactly with the contents of the letter, but assigned a later\r\nhour and a different place of meeting. Apparently the writer of the\r\nletter had been compelled to let Butler so far into his confidence, for\r\nthe sake of announcing this change to Jeanie. She was more than once on\r\nthe point of producing the billet, in vindication of herself from her\r\nlover\xc3\xads half-hinted suspicions. But there is something in stooping to\r\njustification which the pride of innocence does not at all times\r\nwillingly submit to; besides that the threats contained in the letter, in\r\ncase of her betraying the secret, hung heavy on her heart. It is\r\nprobable, however, that had they remained longer together, she might have\r\ntaken the resolution to submit the whole matter to Butler, and be guided\r\nby him as to the line of conduct which she should adopt. And when, by the\r\nsudden interruption of their conference, she lost the opportunity of\r\ndoing so, she felt as if she had been unjust to a friend, whose advice\r\nmight have been highly useful, and whose attachment deserved her full and\r\nunreserved confidence.\r\n\r\nTo have recourse to her father upon this occasion, she considered as\r\nhighly imprudent. There was no possibility of conjecturing in what light\r\nthe matter might strike old David, whose manner of acting and thinking in\r\nextraordinary circumstances depended upon feelings and principles\r\npeculiar to himself, the operation of which could not be calculated upon\r\neven by those best acquainted with him. To have requested some female\r\nfriend to have accompanied her to the place of rendezvous, would perhaps\r\nhave been the most eligible expedient; but the threats of the writer,\r\nthat betraying his secret would prevent their meeting (on which her\r\nsister\xc3\xads safety was said to depend) from taking place at all, would have\r\ndeterred her from making such a confidence, even had she known a person\r\nin whom she thought it could with safety have been reposed. But she knew\r\nnone such. Their acquaintance with the cottagers in the vicinity had been\r\nvery slight, and limited to trifling acts of good neighbourhood. Jeanie\r\nknew little of them, and what she knew did not greatly incline her to\r\ntrust any of them. They were of the order of loquacious good-humoured\r\ngossips usually found in their situation of life; and their conversation\r\nhad at all times few charms for a young woman, to whom nature and the\r\ncircumstance of a solitary life had given a depth of thought and force of\r\ncharacter superior to the frivolous part of her sex, whether in high or\r\nlow degree.\r\n\r\nLeft alone and separated from all earthly counsel, she had recourse to a\r\nfriend and adviser, whose ear is open to the cry of the poorest and most\r\nafflicted of his people. She knelt, and prayed with fervent sincerity,\r\nthat God would please to direct her what course to follow in her arduous\r\nand distressing situation. It was the belief of the time and sect to\r\nwhich she belonged, that special answers to prayer, differing little in\r\ntheir character from divine inspiration, were, as they expressed it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cborne in upon their minds\xe2\x80\x9d in answer to their earnest petitions in a\r\ncrisis of difficulty. Without entering into an abstruse point of\r\ndivinity, one thing is plain;--namely, that the person who lays open his\r\ndoubts and distresses in prayer, with feeling and sincerity, must\r\nnecessarily, in the act of doing so, purify his mind from the dross of\r\nworldly passions and interests, and bring it into that state, when the\r\nresolutions adopted are likely to be selected rather from a sense of\r\nduty, than from any inferior motive. Jeanie arose from her devotions,\r\nwith her heart fortified to endure affliction, and encouraged to face\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will meet this unhappy man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself--\xe2\x80\x9cunhappy he must be,\r\nsince I doubt he has been the cause of poor Effie\xc3\xads misfortune--but I\r\nwill meet him, be it for good or ill. My mind shall never cast up to me,\r\nthat, for fear of what might be said or done to myself, I left that\r\nundone that might even yet be the rescue of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a mind greatly composed since the adoption of this resolution, she\r\nwent to attend her father. The old man, firm in the principles of his\r\nyouth, did not, in outward appearance at least, permit a thought of his\r\nfamily distress to interfere with the stoical reserve of his countenance\r\nand manners. He even chid his daughter for having neglected, in the\r\ndistress of the morning, some trifling domestic duties which fell under\r\nher department.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what meaneth this, Jeanie?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man--\xe2\x80\x9cThe brown\r\nfour-year-auld\xc3\xads milk is not seiled yet, nor the bowies put up on the\r\nbink. If ye neglect your warldly duties in the day of affliction, what\r\nconfidence have I that ye mind the greater matters that concern\r\nsalvation? God knows, our bowies, and our pipkins, and our draps o\xc3\xad milk,\r\nand our bits o\xc3\xad bread, are nearer and dearer to us than the bread of\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie, not unpleased to hear her father\xc3\xads thoughts thus expand\r\nthemselves beyond the sphere of his immediate distress, obeyed him, and\r\nproceeded to put her household matters in order; while old David moved\r\nfrom place to place about his ordinary employments, scarce showing,\r\nunless by a nervous impatience at remaining long stationary, an\r\noccasional convulsive sigh, or twinkle of the eyelid, that he was\r\nlabouring under the yoke of such bitter affliction.\r\n\r\nThe hour of noon came on, and the father and child sat down to their\r\nhomely repast. In his petition for a blessing on the meal, the poor old\r\nman added to his supplication, a prayer that the bread eaten in sadness\r\nof heart, and the bitter waters of Marah, might be made as nourishing as\r\nthose which had been poured forth from a full cup and a plentiful basket\r\nand store; and having concluded his benediction, and resumed the bonnet\r\nwhich he had laid \xe2\x80\x9creverently aside,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded to exhort his daughter\r\nto eat, not by example indeed, but at least by precept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man after God\xc3\xads own heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwashed and anointed himself,\r\nand did eat bread, in order to express his submission under a\r\ndispensation of suffering, and it did not become a Christian man or woman\r\nso to cling to creature-comforts of wife or bairns\xe2\x80\x9d--(here the words\r\nbecame too great, as it were, for his utterance),--\xe2\x80\x9cas to forget the fist\r\nduty,--submission to the Divine will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo add force to his precept, he took a morsel on his plate, but nature\r\nproved too strong even for the powerful feelings with which he\r\nendeavoured to bridle it. Ashamed of his weakness, he started up, and ran\r\nout of the house, with haste very unlike the deliberation of his usual\r\nmovements. In less than five minutes he returned, having successfully\r\nstruggled to recover his ordinary composure of mind and countenance, and\r\naffected to colour over his late retreat, by muttering that he thought he\r\nheard the \xe2\x80\x9cyoung staig loose in the byre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not again trust himself with the subject of his former\r\nconversation, and his daughter was glad to see that he seemed to avoid\r\nfarther discourse on that agitating topic. The hours glided on, as on\r\nthey must and do pass, whether winged with joy or laden with affliction.\r\nThe sun set beyond the dusky eminence of the Castle and the screen of\r\nwestern hills, and the close of evening summoned David Deans and his\r\ndaughter to the family duty of the night. It came bitterly upon Jeanie\xc3\xads\r\nrecollection, how often, when the hour of worship approached, she used to\r\nwatch the lengthening shadows, and look out from the door of the house,\r\nto see if she could spy her sister\xc3\xads return homeward. Alas! this idle and\r\nthoughtless waste of time, to what evils had it not finally led? and was\r\nshe altogether guiltless, who, noticing Effie\xc3\xads turn to idle and light\r\nsociety, had not called in her father\xc3\xads authority to restrain her?--But I\r\nacted for the best, she again reflected, and who could have expected such\r\na growth of evil, from one grain of human leaven, in a disposition so\r\nkind, and candid, and generous?\r\n\r\nAs they sate down to the \xe2\x80\x9cexercise,\xe2\x80\x9d as it is called, a chair happened\r\naccidentally to stand in the place which Effie usually occupied. David\r\nDeans saw his daughter\xc3\xads eyes swim in tears as they were directed towards\r\nthis object, and pushed it aside, with a gesture of some impatience, as\r\nif desirous to destroy every memorial of earthly interest when about to\r\naddress the Deity. The portion of Scripture was read, the psalm was sung,\r\nthe prayer was made; and it was remarkable that, in discharging these\r\nduties, the old man avoided all passages and expressions, of which\r\nScripture affords so many, that might be considered as applicable to his\r\nown domestic misfortune. In doing so it was perhaps his intention to\r\nspare the feelings of his daughter, as well as to maintain, in outward\r\nshow at least, that stoical appearance of patient endurance of all the\r\nevil which earth could bring, which was in his opinion essential to the\r\ncharacter of one who rated all earthly things at their just estimate of\r\nnothingness. When he had finished the duty of the evening, he came up to\r\nhis daughter, wished her good-night, and, having done so, continued to\r\nhold her by the hands for half-a-minute; then drawing her towards him,\r\nkissed her forehead, and ejaculated, \xe2\x80\x9cThe God of Israel bless you, even\r\nwith the blessings of the promise, my dear bairn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not either in the nature or habits of David Deans to seem a fond\r\nfather; nor was he often observed to experience, or at least to evince,\r\nthat fulness of the heart which seeks to expand itself in tender\r\nexpressions or caresses even to those who were dearest to him. On the\r\ncontrary, he used to censure this as a degree of weakness in several of\r\nhis neighbours, and particularly in poor widow Butler. It followed,\r\nhowever, from the rarity of such emotions in this self-denied and\r\nreserved man, that his children attached to occasional marks of his\r\naffection and approbation a degree of high interest and solemnity; well\r\nconsidering them as evidences of feelings which were only expressed when\r\nthey became too intense for suppression or concealment.\r\n\r\nWith deep emotion, therefore, did he bestow, and his daughter receive,\r\nthis benediction and paternal caress. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, my dear father,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaimed Jeanie, when the door had closed upon the venerable old man,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmay you have purchased and promised blessings multiplied upon you--upon\r\n_you,_ who walk in this world as though you were not of the world, and\r\nhold all that it can give or take away but as the _midges_ that the\r\nsun-blink brings out, and the evening wind sweeps away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe now made preparation for her night-walk. Her father slept in another\r\npart of the dwelling, and, regular in all his habits, seldom or never\r\nleft his apartment when he had betaken himself to it for the evening. It\r\nwas therefore easy for her to leave the house unobserved, so soon as the\r\ntime approached at which she was to keep her appointment. But the step\r\nshe was about to take had difficulties and terrors in her own eyes,\r\nthough she had no reason to apprehend her father\xc3\xads interference. Her life\r\nhad been spent in the quiet, uniform, and regular seclusion of their\r\npeaceful and monotonous household. The very hour which some damsels of\r\nthe present day, as well of her own as of higher degree, would consider\r\nas the natural period of commencing an evening of pleasure, brought, in\r\nher opinion, awe and solemnity in it; and the resolution she had taken\r\nhad a strange, daring, and adventurous character, to which she could\r\nhardly reconcile herself when the moment approached for putting it into\r\nexecution. Her hands trembled as she snooded her fair hair beneath the\r\nriband, then the only ornament or cover which young unmarried women wore\r\non their head, and as she adjusted the scarlet tartan screen or muffler\r\nmade of plaid, which the Scottish women wore, much in the fashion of the\r\nblack silk veils still a part of female dress in the Netherlands. A sense\r\nof impropriety as well as of danger pressed upon her, as she lifted the\r\nlatch of her paternal mansion to leave it on so wild an expedition, and\r\nat so late an hour, unprotected, and without the knowledge of her natural\r\nguardian.\r\n\r\nWhen she found herself abroad and in the open fields, additional subjects\r\nof apprehension crowded upon her. The dim cliffs and scattered rocks,\r\ninterspersed with greensward, through which she had to pass to the place\r\nof appointment, as they glimmered before her in a clear autumn night,\r\nrecalled to her memory many a deed of violence, which, according to\r\ntradition, had been done and suffered among them. In earlier days they\r\nhad been the haunt of robbers and assassins, the memory of whose crimes\r\nis preserved in the various edicts which the council of the city, and\r\neven the parliament of Scotland, had passed for dispersing their bands,\r\nand ensuring safety to the lieges, so near the precincts of the city. The\r\nnames of these criminals, and, of their atrocities, were still remembered\r\nin traditions of the scattered cottages and the neighbouring suburb. In\r\nlatter times, as we have already noticed, the sequestered and broken\r\ncharacter of the ground rendered it a fit theatre for duels and\r\nrencontres among the fiery youth of the period. Two or three of these\r\nincidents, all sanguinary, and one of them fatal in its termination, had\r\nhappened since Deans came to live at St. Leonard\xc3\xads. His daughter\xc3\xads\r\nrecollections, therefore, were of blood and horror as she pursued the\r\nsmall scarce-tracked solitary path, every step of which conveyed her to a\r\ngreater distance from help, and deeper into the ominous seclusion of\r\nthese unhallowed precincts.\r\n\r\nAs the moon began to peer forth on the scene with a doubtful, flitting,\r\nand solemn light, Jeanie\xc3\xads apprehensions took another turn, too peculiar\r\nto her rank and country to remain unnoticed. But to trace its origin will\r\nrequire another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The spirit I have seen\r\n                      May be the devil. And the devil has power\r\n                      To assume a pleasing shape.\r\n                                              Hamlet.\r\n\r\nWitchcraft and demonology, as we have already had occasion to remark, were\r\nat this period believed in by almost all ranks, but more especially among\r\nthe stricter classes of Presbyterians, whose government, when their party\r\nwere at the head of the state, had been much sullied by their eagerness\r\nto inquire into and persecute these imaginary crimes. Now, in this point\r\nof view, also, Saint Leonard\xc3\xads Crags and the adjacent Chase were a\r\ndreaded and ill-reputed district. Not only had witches held their\r\nmeetings there, but even of very late years the enthusiast or impostor,\r\nmentioned in the _Pandaemonium_ of Richard Bovet, Gentleman,* had, among\r\nthe recesses of these romantic cliffs, found his way into the hidden\r\nretreats where the fairies revel in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\n* Note I. The Fairy Boy of Leith.\r\n\r\nWith all these legends Jeanie Deans was too well acquainted to escape\r\nthat strong impression which they usually make on the imagination.\r\nIndeed, relations of this ghostly kind had been familiar to her from her\r\ninfancy, for they were the only relief which her father\xc3\xads conversation\r\nafforded from controversial argument, or the gloomy history of the\r\nstrivings and testimonies, escapes, captures, tortures, and executions of\r\nthose martyrs of the Covenant, with whom it was his chiefest boast to say\r\nhe had been acquainted. In the recesses of mountains, in caverns, and in\r\nmorasses, to which these persecuted enthusiasts were so ruthlessly\r\npursued, they conceived they had often to contend with the visible\r\nassaults of the Enemy of mankind, as in the cities, and in the cultivated\r\nfields, they were exposed to those of the tyrannical government and their\r\nsoldiery. Such were the terrors which made one of their gifted seers\r\nexclaim, when his companion returned to him, after having left him alone\r\nin a haunted cavern in Sorn in Galloway, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard living in this\r\nworld-incarnate devils above the earth, and devils under the earth! Satan\r\nhas been here since ye went away, but I have dismissed him by resistance;\r\nwe will be no more troubled with him this night.\xe2\x80\x9d David Deans believed\r\nthis, and many other such ghostly encounters and victories, on the faith\r\nof the Ansars, or auxiliaries of the banished prophets. This event was\r\nbeyond David\xc3\xads remembrance. But he used to tell with great awe, yet not\r\nwithout a feeling of proud superiority to his auditors, how he himself\r\nhad been present at a field-meeting at Crochmade, when the duty of the\r\nday was interrupted by the apparition of a tall black man, who, in the\r\nact of crossing a ford to join the congregation, lost ground, and was\r\ncarried down apparently by the force of the stream. All were instantly at\r\nwork to assist him, but with so little success, that ten or twelve stout\r\nmen, who had hold of the rope which they had cast in to his aid, were\r\nrather in danger to be dragged into the stream, and lose their own lives,\r\nthan likely to save that of the supposed perishing man. \xe2\x80\x9cBut famous John\r\nSemple of Carspharn,\xe2\x80\x9d David Deans used to say with exultation, \xe2\x80\x9csaw the\r\nwhaup in the rape.--\xc3\xabQuit the rope,\xc3\xad he cried to us (for I that was but a\r\ncallant had a hand o\xc3\xad the rape mysell), \xc3\xabit is the Great Enemy! he will\r\nburn, but not drown; his design is to disturb the good wark, by raising\r\nwonder and confusion in your minds; to put off from your spirits all that\r\nye hae heard and felt.\xc3\xad--Sae we let go the rape,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\r\nwent adown the water screeching and bullering like a Bull of Bashan, as\r\nhe\xc3\xads ca\xc3\xadd in Scripture.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* Note J. Intercourse of the Covenanters with the invisible world.\r\n\r\nTrained in these and similar legends, it was no wonder that Jeanie began\r\nto feel an ill-defined apprehension, not merely of the phantoms which\r\nmight beset her way, but of the quality, nature, and purpose of the being\r\nwho had thus appointed her a meeting, at a place and hour of horror, and\r\nat a time when her mind must be necessarily full of those tempting and\r\nensnaring thoughts of grief and despair, which were supposed to lay\r\nsufferers particularly open to the temptations of the Evil One. If such\r\nan idea had crossed even Butler\xc3\xads well-informed mind, it was calculated\r\nto make a much stronger impression upon hers. Yet firmly believing the\r\npossibility of an encounter so terrible to flesh and blood, Jeanie, with\r\na degree of resolution of which we cannot sufficiently estimate the\r\nmerit, because the incredulity of the age has rendered us strangers to\r\nthe nature and extent of her feelings, persevered in her determination\r\nnot to omit an opportunity of doing something towards saving her sister,\r\nalthough, in the attempt to avail herself of it, she might be exposed to\r\ndangers so dreadful to her imagination. So, like Christiana in the\r\nPilgrim\xc3\xads Progress, when traversing with a timid yet resolved step the\r\nterrors of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, she glided on by rock and\r\nstone, \xe2\x80\x9cnow in glimmer and now in gloom,\xe2\x80\x9d as her path lay through\r\nmoonlight or shadow, and endeavoured to overpower the suggestions of\r\nfear, sometimes by fixing her mind upon the distressed condition of her\r\nsister, and the duty she lay under to afford her aid, should that be in\r\nher power; and more frequently by recurring in mental prayer to the\r\nprotection of that Being to whom night is as noon-day.\r\n\r\nThus drowning at one time her fears by fixing her mind on a subject of\r\noverpowering interest, and arguing them down at others by referring\r\nherself to the protection of the Deity, she at length approached the\r\nplace assigned for this mysterious conference.\r\n\r\nIt was situated in the depth of the valley behind Salisbury Crags, which\r\nhas for a background the north-western shoulder of the mountain called\r\nArthur\xc3\xads Seat, on whose descent still remain the ruins of what was once a\r\nchapel, or hermitage, dedicated to St. Anthony the Eremite. A better site\r\nfor such a building could hardly have been selected; for the chapel,\r\nsituated among the rude and pathless cliffs, lies in a desert, even in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of a rich, populous, and tumultuous capital: and\r\nthe hum of the city might mingle with the orisons of the recluses,\r\nconveying as little of worldly interest as if it had been the roar of the\r\ndistant ocean. Beneath the steep ascent on which these ruins are still\r\nvisible, was, and perhaps is still pointed out, the place where the\r\nwretch Nichol Muschat, who has been already mentioned in these pages, had\r\nclosed a long scene of cruelty towards his unfortunate wife, by murdering\r\nher, with circumstances of uncommon barbarity.*\r\n\r\n* See Note G. Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn.\r\n\r\nThe execration in which the man\xc3\xads crime was held extended itself to the\r\nplace where it was perpetrated, which was marked by a small _cairn,_ or\r\nheap of stones, composed of those which each chance passenger had thrown\r\nthere in testimony of abhorrence, and on the principle, it would seem, of\r\nthe ancient British malediction, \xe2\x80\x9cMay you have a cairn for your\r\nburial-place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn--221]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our heroine approached this ominous and unhallowed spot, she paused\r\nand looked to the moon, now rising broad in the north-west, and shedding\r\na more distinct light than it had afforded during her walk thither.\r\nEyeing the planet for a moment, she then slowly and fearfully turned her\r\nhead towards the cairn, from which it was at first averted. She was at\r\nfirst disappointed. Nothing was visible beside the little pile of stones,\r\nwhich shone grey in the moonlight. A multitude of confused suggestions\r\nrushed on her mind. Had her correspondent deceived her, and broken his\r\nappointment?--was he too tardy at the appointment he had made?--or had\r\nsome strange turn of fate prevented him from appearing as he\r\nproposed?--or, if he were an unearthly being, as her secret\r\napprehensions suggested, was it his object merely to delude her with\r\nfalse hopes, and put her to unnecessary toil and terror, according to\r\nthe nature, as she had heard, of those wandering demons?--or did he\r\npurpose to blast her with the sudden horrors of his presence when she\r\nhad come close to the place of rendezvous? These anxious reflections did\r\nnot prevent her approaching to the cairn with a pace that, though slow,\r\nwas determined.\r\n\r\nWhen she was within two yards of the heap of stones, a figure rose\r\nsuddenly up from behind it, and Jeanie scarce forbore to scream aloud at\r\nwhat seemed the realisation of the most frightful of her anticipations.\r\nShe constrained herself to silence, however, and, making a dead pause,\r\nsuffered the figure to open the conversation, which he did, by asking, in\r\na voice which agitation rendered tremulous and hollow, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you the\r\nsister of that ill-fated young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am--I am the sister of Effie Deans!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Jeanie. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as ever\r\nyou hope God will hear you at your need, tell me, if you can tell, what\r\ncan be done to save her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do _not_ hope God will hear me at my need,\xe2\x80\x9d was the singular answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not deserve--I do not expect he will.\xe2\x80\x9d This desperate language he\r\nuttered in a tone calmer than that with which he had at first spoken,\r\nprobably because the shook of first addressing her was what he felt most\r\ndifficult to overcome. Jeanie remained mute with horror to hear language\r\nexpressed so utterly foreign to all which she had ever been acquainted\r\nwith, that it sounded in her ears rather like that of a fiend than of a\r\nhuman being. The stranger pursued his address to her, without seeming to\r\nnotice her surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see before you a wretch, predestined to evil\r\nhere and hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the sake of Heaven, that hears and sees us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cdinna\r\nspeak in this desperate fashion! The gospel is sent to the chief of\r\nsinners--to the most miserable among the miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen should I have my own share therein,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\ncall it sinful to have been the destruction of the mother that bore\r\nme--of the friend that loved me--of the woman that trusted me--of the\r\ninnocent child that was born to me. If to have done all this is to be a\r\nsinner, and survive it is to be miserable, then am I most guilty and most\r\nmiserable indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are the wicked cause of my sister\xc3\xads ruin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, with a\r\nnatural touch of indignation expressed in her tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse me for it, if you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger; \xe2\x80\x9cI have well deserved\r\nit at your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is fitter for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cto pray to God to forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as you will, how you will, or what you will,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with\r\nvehemence; \xe2\x80\x9conly promise to obey my directions, and save your sister\xc3\xads\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must first know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cthe means you would have me use in her\r\nbehalf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!--you must first swear--solemnly swear, that you will employ them\r\nwhen I make them known to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, it is needless to swear that I will do all that is lawful to a\r\nChristian to save the life of my sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will have no reservation!\xe2\x80\x9d thundered the stranger; \xe2\x80\x9clawful or\r\nunlawful, Christian or heathen, you shall swear to do my hest, and act by\r\nmy counsel, or--you little know whose wrath you provoke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will think on what you have said,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who began to get much\r\nalarmed at the frantic vehemence of his manner, and disputed in her own\r\nmind, whether she spoke to a maniac, or an apostate spirit incarnate--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill think on what you say, and let you ken to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the man with a laugh of scorn--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where will I\r\nbe to-morrow?--or, where will you be to-night, unless you swear to walk\r\nby my counsel?--there was one accursed deed done at this spot before now;\r\nand there shall be another to match it, unless you yield up to my\r\nguidance body and soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he offered a pistol at the unfortunate young woman. She\r\nneither fled nor fainted, but sunk on her knees, and asked him to spare\r\nher life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all you have to say?\xe2\x80\x9d said the unmoved ruffian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not dip your hands in the blood of a defenceless creature that has\r\ntrusted to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, still on her knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all you can say for your life?--Have you no promise to\r\ngive?--Will you destroy your sister, and compel me to shed more blood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can promise nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is unlawful for a\r\nChristian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe cocked the weapon, and held it towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God forgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pressing her hands forcibly against her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--n!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the man; and, turning aside from her, he uncocked the\r\npistol, and replaced it in his pocket--\xe2\x80\x9cI am a villain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csteeped in guilt and wretchedness, but not wicked enough to do you any\r\nharm! I only wished to terrify you into my measures--She hears me\r\nnot--she is gone!--Great God! what a wretch am I become!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, she recovered herself from an agony which partook of the\r\nbitterness of death; and, in a minute or two, through the strong exertion\r\nof her natural sense and courage, collected herself sufficiently to\r\nunderstand he intended her no personal injury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated; \xe2\x80\x9cI would not add to the murder of your sister, and of\r\nher child, that of any one belonging to her!--Mad, frantic, as I am, and\r\nunrestrained by either fear or mercy, given up to the possession of an\r\nevil being, and forsaken by all that is good, I would not hurt you, were\r\nthe world offered me for a bribe! But, for the sake of all that is dear\r\nto you, swear you will follow my counsel. Take this weapon, shoot me\r\nthrough the head, and with your own hand revenge your sister\xc3\xads wrong,\r\nonly follow the course--the only course, by which her life can be saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! is she innocent or guilty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is guiltless--guiltless of every thing, but of having trusted a\r\nvillain!--Yet, had it not been for those that were worse than I am--yes,\r\nworse than I am, though I am bad indeed--this misery had not befallen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my sister\xc3\xads child--does it live?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it was murdered--the new-born infant was barbarously murdered,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nuttered in a low, yet stern and sustained voice.--\xe2\x80\x9cbut,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nhastily, \xe2\x80\x9cnot by her knowledge or consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, why cannot the guilty be brought to justice, and the innocent\r\nfreed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorment me not with questions which can serve no purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d he sternly\r\nreplied--\xe2\x80\x9cThe deed was done by those who are far enough from pursuit, and\r\nsafe enough from discovery!--No one can save Effie but yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoe\xc3\xads me! how is it in my power?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jeanie, in despondency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearken to me!--You have sense--you can apprehend my meaning--I will\r\ntrust you. Your sister is innocent of the crime charged against her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God for that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe still and hearken!--The person who assisted her in her illness\r\nmurdered the child; but it was without the mother\xc3\xads knowledge or\r\nconsent--She is therefore guiltless, as guiltless as the unhappy\r\ninnocent, that but gasped a few minutes in this unhappy world--the\r\nbetter was its hap, to be so soon at rest. She is innocent as that\r\ninfant, and yet she must die--it is impossible to clear her of the law!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCannot the wretches be discovered, and given up to punishment?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you will persuade those who are hardened in guilt to die to\r\nsave another?--Is that the reed you would lean to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said there was a remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d again gasped out the terrified young\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is in your own hands. The blow\r\nwhich the law aims cannot be broken by directly encountering it, but it\r\nmay be turned aside. You saw your sister during the period preceding the\r\nbirth of her child--what is so natural as that she should have mentioned\r\nher condition to you? The doing so would, as their cant goes, take the\r\ncase from under the statute, for it removes the quality of concealment. I\r\nknow their jargon, and have had sad cause to know it; and the quality of\r\nconcealment is essential to this statutory offence.*\r\n\r\n* Note K. Child Murder.\r\n\r\nNothing is so natural as that Effie should have mentioned her condition\r\nto you--think--reflect--I am positive that she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoe\xc3\xads me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cshe never spoke to me on the subject, but grat\r\nsorely when I spoke to her about her altered looks, and the change on her\r\nspirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou asked her questions on the subject?\xe2\x80\x9d he said eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _must_\r\nremember her answer was, a confession that she had been ruined by a\r\nvillain--yes, lay a strong emphasis on that--a cruel false villain call\r\nit--any other name is unnecessary; and that she bore under her bosom the\r\nconsequences of his guilt and her folly; and that he had assured her he\r\nwould provide safely for her approaching illness.--Well he kept his\r\nword!\xe2\x80\x9d These last words he spoke as if it were to himself, and with a\r\nviolent gesture of self-accusation, and then calmly proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will\r\nremember all this?--That is all that is necessary to be said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannot remember,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie, with simplicity, \xe2\x80\x9cthat which\r\nEffie never told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you so dull--so very dull of apprehension?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, suddenly\r\ngrasping her arm, and holding it firm in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you\xe2\x80\x9d (speaking\r\nbetween his teeth, and under his breath, but with great energy), \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\n_must_ remember that she told you all this, whether she ever said a\r\nsyllable of it or no. You must repeat this tale, in which there is no\r\nfalsehood, except in so far as it was not told to you, before these\r\nJustices--Justiciary--whatever they call their bloodthirsty court, and\r\nsave your sister from being murdered, and them from becoming murderers.\r\nDo not hesitate--I pledge life and salvation, that in saying what I have\r\nsaid, you will only speak the simple truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie, whose judgment was too accurate not to see the\r\nsophistry of this argument, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be man-sworn in the very thing in\r\nwhich my testimony is wanted, for it is the concealment for which poor\r\nEffie is blamed, and you would make me tell a falsehood anent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy first suspicions of you were right, and that you\r\nwill let your sister, innocent, fair, and guiltless, except in trusting a\r\nvillain, die the death of a murderess, rather than bestow the breath of\r\nyour mouth and the sound of your voice to save her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wad ware the best blood in my body to keep her skaithless,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJeanie, weeping in bitter agony, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I canna change right into wrang, or\r\nmake that true which is false.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish, hardhearted girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9care you afraid of what\r\nthey may do to you? I tell you, even the retainers of the law, who course\r\nlife as greyhounds do hares, will rejoice at the escape of a creature so\r\nyoung--so beautiful, that they will not suspect your tale; that, if they\r\ndid suspect it, they would consider you as deserving, not only of\r\nforgiveness, but of praise for your natural affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not man I fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, looking upward; \xe2\x80\x9cthe God, whose name\r\nI must call on to witness the truth of what I say, he will know the\r\nfalsehood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he will know the motive,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9che will know\r\nthat you are doing this--not for lucre of gain, but to save the life of\r\nthe innocent, and prevent the commission of a worse crime than that which\r\nthe law seeks to avenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has given us a law,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the lamp of our path; if we\r\nstray from it we err against knowledge--I may not do evil, even that good\r\nmay come out of it. But you--you that ken all this to be true, which I\r\nmust take on your word--you that, if I understood what you said e\xc3\xaden now,\r\npromised her shelter and protection in her travail, why do not _you_ step\r\nforward, and bear leal and soothfast evidence in her behalf, as ye may\r\nwith a clear conscience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom do you talk of a clear conscience, woman?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a\r\nsudden fierceness which renewed her terrors,--\xe2\x80\x9cto _me?_--I have not known\r\none for many a year. Bear witness in her behalf?--a proper witness, that\r\neven to speak these few words to a woman of so little consequence as\r\nyourself, must choose such an hour and such a place as this. When you see\r\nowls and bats fly abroad, like larks, in the sunshine, you may expect to\r\nsee such as I am in the assemblies of men.--Hush--listen to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA voice was heard to sing one of those wild and monotonous strains so\r\ncommon in Scotland, and to which the natives of that country chant their\r\nold ballads. The sound ceased--then came nearer, and was renewed; the\r\nstranger listened attentively, still holding Jeanie by the arm (as she\r\nstood by him in motionless terror), as if to prevent her interrupting the\r\nstrain by speaking or stirring. When the sounds were renewed, the words\r\nwere distinctly audible:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the glede\xc3\xads in the blue cloud,\r\n                        The lavrock lies still;\r\n                  When the hound\xc3\xads in\xc3\xad the green-wood,\r\n                       The hind keeps the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe person who sung kept a strained and powerful voice at its highest\r\npitch, so that it could be heard at a very considerable distance. As the\r\nsong ceased, they might hear a stifled sound, as of steps and whispers of\r\npersons approaching them. The song was again raised, but the tune was\r\nchanged:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cO sleep ye sound, Sir James, she said,\r\n                      When ye suld rise and ride;\r\n                There\xc3\xads twenty men, wi\xc3\xad bow and blade,\r\n                      Are seeking where ye hide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare stay no longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger; \xe2\x80\x9creturn home, or remain till\r\nthey come up--you have nothing to fear--but do not tell you saw me--your\r\nsister\xc3\xads fate is in your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he turned from her, and with\r\na swift, yet cautiously noiseless step, plunged into the darkness on the\r\nside most remote from the sounds which they heard approaching, and was\r\nsoon lost to her sight. Jeanie remained by the cairn terrified beyond\r\nexpression, and uncertain whether she ought to fly homeward with all the\r\nspeed she could exert, or wait the approach of those who were advancing\r\ntowards her. This uncertainty detained her so long, that she now\r\ndistinctly saw two or three figures already so near to her, that a\r\nprecipitate flight would have been equally fruitless and impolitic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           She speaks things in doubt,\r\n                 That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,\r\n                 Yet the unshaped use of it doth move\r\n                 The hearers to collection; they aim at it,\r\n                 And botch the words up to fit their own thoughts.\r\n                                           Hamlet.\r\n\r\nLike the digressive poet Ariosto, I find myself under the necessity of\r\nconnecting the branches of my story, by taking up the adventures of\r\nanother of the characters, and bringing them down to the point at which\r\nwe have left those of Jeanie Deans. It is not, perhaps, the most\r\nartificial way of telling a story, but it has the advantage of sparing\r\nthe necessity of resuming what a knitter (if stocking-looms have left\r\nsuch a person in the land) might call our \xe2\x80\x9cdropped stitches;\xe2\x80\x9d a labour in\r\nwhich the author generally toils much, without getting credit for his\r\npains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could risk a sma\xc3\xad wad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk to the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this\r\nrascal Ratcliffe, if he were insured of his neck\xc3\xads safety, could do more\r\nthan ony ten of our police-people and constables to help us to get out of\r\nthis scrape of Porteous\xc3\xads. He is weel acquent wi\xc3\xad a\xc3\xad the smugglers,\r\nthieves, and banditti about Edinburgh; and, indeed, he may be called the\r\nfather of a\xc3\xad the misdoers in Scotland, for he has passed amang them for\r\nthese twenty years by the name of Daddie Rat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bonny sort of a scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cto expect a place\r\nunder the city!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegging your honour\xc3\xads pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the city\xc3\xads procurator-fiscal, upon\r\nwhom the duties of superintendent of police devolved, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Fairscrieve is\r\nperfectly in the right. It is just sic as Ratcliffe that the town needs\r\nin my department; an\xc3\xad if sae be that he\xc3\xads disposed to turn his knowledge\r\nto the city service, yell no find a better man.--Ye\xc3\xadll get nae saints to\r\nbe searchers for uncustomed goods, or for thieves and sic like;--and your\r\ndecent sort of men, religious professors, and broken tradesmen, that are\r\nput into the like o\xc3\xad sic trust, can do nae gude ava. They are feared for\r\nthis, and they are scrupulous about that, and they arena free to tell a\r\nlie, though it may be for the benefit of the city; and they dinna like to\r\nbe out at irregular hours, and in a dark cauld night, and they like a\r\nclout ower the crown far waur; and sae between the fear o\xc3\xad God, and the\r\nfear o\xc3\xad man, and the fear o\xc3\xad getting a sair throat, or sair banes,\r\nthere\xc3\xads a dozen o\xc3\xad our city-folk, baith waiters, and officers, and\r\nconstables, that can find out naething but a wee bit skulduddery for the\r\nbenefit of the Kirk treasurer. Jock Porteous, that\xc3\xads stiff and stark,\r\npuir fallow, was worth a dozen o\xc3\xad them; for he never had ony fears, or\r\nscruples, or doubts, or conscience, about onything your honours bade\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a gude servant o\xc3\xad the town,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bailie, \xe2\x80\x9cthough he was an\r\nower free-living man. But if you really think this rascal Ratcliffe could\r\ndo us ony service in discovering these malefactors, I would insure him\r\nlife, reward, and promotion. It\xc3\xads an awsome thing this mischance for the\r\ncity, Mr. Fairscrieve. It will be very ill taen wi\xc3\xad abune stairs. Queen\r\nCaroline, God bless her! is a woman--at least I judge sae, and it\xc3\xads nae\r\ntreason to speak my mind sae far--and ye maybe ken as weel as I do, for\r\nye hae a housekeeper, though ye arena a married man, that women are\r\nwilfu\xc3\xad, and downa bide a slight. And it will sound ill in her ears, that\r\nsic a confused mistake suld come to pass, and naebody sae muckle as to be\r\nput into the Tolbooth about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ye thought that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator-fiscal, \xe2\x80\x9cwe could easily\r\nclap into the prison a few blackguards upon suspicion. It will have a\r\ngude active look, and I hae aye plenty on my list, that wadna be a hair\r\nthe waur of a week or twa\xc3\xads imprisonment; and if ye thought it no\r\nstrictly just, ye could be just the easier wi\xc3\xad them the neist time they\r\ndid onything to deserve it; they arena the sort to be lang o\xc3\xad gieing ye\r\nan opportunity to clear scores wi\xc3\xad them on that account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt that will hardly do in this case, Mr. Sharpitlaw,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\ntown-clerk; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xc3\xadll run their letters,* and be adrift again, before ye\r\nken where ye are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* A Scottish form of procedure, answering, in some respects, to the\r\nEnglish Habeas Corpus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will speak to the Lord Provost,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cabout\r\nRatcliffe\xc3\xads business. Mr. Sharpitlaw, you will go with me, and receive\r\ninstructions--something may be made too out of this story of Butler\xc3\xads and\r\nhis unknown gentleman--I know no business any man has to swagger about in\r\nthe King\xc3\xads Park, and call himself the devil, to the terror of honest\r\nfolks, who dinna care to hear mair about the devil than is said from the\r\npulpit on the Sabbath. I cannot think the preacher himsell wad be heading\r\nthe mob, though the time has been, they hae been as forward in a bruilzie\r\nas their neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut these times are lang by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sharpitlaw. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my father\xc3\xads time,\r\nthere was mair search for silenced ministers about the Bow-head and the\r\nCovenant Close, and all the tents of Kedar, as they ca\xc3\xadd the dwellings o\xc3\xad\r\nthe godly in those days, than there\xc3\xads now for thieves and vagabonds in\r\nthe Laigh Calton and the back o\xc3\xad the Canongate. But that time\xc3\xads weel by,\r\nan it bide. And if the Bailie will get me directions and authority from\r\nthe Provost, I\xc3\xadll speak wi\xc3\xad Daddie Rat mysell; for I\xc3\xadm thinking I\xc3\xadll make\r\nmair out o\xc3\xad him than ye\xc3\xadll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Sharpitlaw, being necessarily a man of high trust, was accordingly\r\nempowered, in the course of the day, to make such arrangements as might\r\nseem in the emergency most advantageous for the Good Town. He went to the\r\njail accordingly, and saw Ratcliffe in private.\r\n\r\nThe relative positions of a police-officer and a professed thief bear a\r\ndifferent complexion, according to circumstances. The most obvious simile\r\nof a hawk pouncing upon his prey is often least applicable. Sometimes the\r\nguardian of justice has the air of a cat watching a mouse, and, while he\r\nsuspends his purpose of springing upon the pilferer, takes care so to\r\ncalculate his motions that he shall not get beyond his power. Sometimes,\r\nmore passive still, he uses the art of fascination ascribed to the\r\nrattlesnake, and contents himself with glaring on the victim, through all\r\nhis devious flutterings; certain that his terror, confusion, and disorder\r\nof ideas, will bring him into his jaws at last. The interview between\r\nRatcliffe and Sharpitlaw had an aspect different from all these. They sat\r\nfor five minutes silent, on opposite sides of a small table, and looked\r\nfixedly at each other, with a sharp, knowing, and alert cast of\r\ncountenance, not unmingled with an inclination to laugh, and resembled\r\nmore than anything else, two dogs, who, preparing for a game at romps,\r\nare seen to couch down, and remain in that posture for a little time,\r\nwatching each other\xc3\xads movements, and waiting which shall begin the game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, Mr. Ratcliffe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, conceiving it suited his dignity\r\nto speak first, \xe2\x80\x9cyou give up business, I find?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ratcliffe; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be on that lay nae mair--and I\r\nthink that will save your folk some trouble, Mr. Sharpitlaw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich Jock Daigleish\xe2\x80\x9d (then finisher of the law* in the Scottish\r\nmetropolis) \xe2\x80\x9cwad save them as easily,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the procurator-fiscal.\r\n\r\n* [Among the flying leaves of the period, there is one called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSutherland\xc3\xads Lament for the loss of his post,--with his advice, to John\r\nDaglees his successor.\xe2\x80\x9d He was whipped and banished 25th July 1722. There\r\nis another, called the Speech and dying words of John Dalgleish, lockman\r\n_alias_ hangman of Edinburgh, containing these lines:--\r\n\r\n                      Death, I\xc3\xadve a Favour for to beg,\r\n                      That ye wad only gie a Fleg,\r\n                           And spare my Life;\r\n                      As I did to ill-hanged Megg,\r\n                               The Webster\xc3\xads Wife.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; if I waited in the Tolbooth here to have him fit my cravat--but\r\nthat\xc3\xads an idle way o\xc3\xad speaking, Mr. Sharpitlaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I suppose you know you are under sentence of death, Mr. Ratcliffe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied Mr. Sharpitlaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, so are a\xc3\xad, as that worthy minister said in the Tolbooth Kirk the\r\nday Robertson wan off; but naebody kens when it will be executed. Gude\r\nfaith, he had better reason to say sae than he dreamed off, before the\r\nplay was played out that morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis Robertson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, in a lower and something like a\r\nconfidential tone, \xe2\x80\x9cd\xc3\xadye ken, Rat--that is, can ye gie us ony inkling\r\nwhere he is to be heard tell o\xc3\xad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroth, Mr. Sharpitlaw, I\xc3\xadll be frank wi\xc3\xad ye; Robertson is rather a cut\r\nabune me--a wild deevil he was, and mony a daft prank he played; but\r\nexcept the Collector\xc3\xads job that Wilson led him into, and some tuilzies\r\nabout run goods wi\xc3\xad the gaugers and the waiters, he never did onything\r\nthat came near our line o\xc3\xad business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUmph! that\xc3\xads singular, considering the company he kept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFact, upon my honour and credit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe keepit\r\nout o\xc3\xad our little bits of affairs, and that\xc3\xads mair than Wilson did; I hae\r\ndune business wi\xc3\xad Wilson afore now. But the lad will come on in time;\r\nthere\xc3\xads nae fear o\xc3\xad him; naebody will live the life he has led, but what\r\nhe\xc3\xadll come to sooner or later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho or what is he, Ratcliffe? you know, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads better born, I judge, than he cares to let on; he\xc3\xads been a soldier,\r\nand he has been a play-actor, and I watna what he has been or hasna been,\r\nfor as young as he is, sae that it had daffing and nonsense about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty pranks he has played in his time, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may say that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, with a sardonic smile; \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d (touching\r\nhis nose) \xe2\x80\x9ca deevil amang the lasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw. \xe2\x80\x9cWeel, Ratcliffe, I\xc3\xadll no stand niffering\r\nwi\xc3\xad ye; ye ken the way that favour\xc3\xads gotten in my office; ye maun be\r\nusefu\xc3\xad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, sir, to the best of my power--naething for naething--I ken\r\nthe rule of the office,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ex-depredator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the principal thing in hand e\xc3\xaden now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the official person, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthe job of Porteous\xc3\xads; an ye can gie us a lift--why, the inner turnkey\xc3\xads\r\noffice to begin wi\xc3\xad, and the captainship in time--ye understand my\r\nmeaning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, troth do I, sir; a wink\xc3\xads as gude as a nod to a blind horse; but\r\nJock Porteous\xc3\xads job--Lord help ye!--I was under sentence the haill time.\r\nGod! but I couldna help laughing when I heard Jock skirting for mercy in\r\nthe lads\xc3\xad hands. Mony a het skin ye hae gien me, neighbour, thought I,\r\ntak ye what\xc3\xads gaun: time about\xc3\xads fair play; ye\xc3\xadll ken now what hanging\xc3\xads\r\ngude for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, this is all nonsense, Rat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator. \xe2\x80\x9cYe canna\r\ncreep out at that hole, lad; you must speak to the point--you understand\r\nme--if you want favour; gif-gaf makes gude friends, ye ken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I speak to the point, as your honour ca\xc3\xads it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRatcliffe, demurely, and with an air of great simplicity, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen ye ken I\r\nwas under sentence and in the strong room a\xc3\xad the while the job was going\r\non?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how can we turn ye loose on the public again, Daddie Rat, unless ye\r\ndo or say something to deserve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, d--n it!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the criminal, \xe2\x80\x9csince it maun be sae, I\r\nsaw Geordie Robertson among the boys that brake the jail; I suppose that\r\nwill do me some gude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads speaking to the purpose, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the office-bearer; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nnow, Rat, where think ye we\xc3\xadll find him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeil haet o\xc3\xad me kens,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe; \xe2\x80\x9che\xc3\xadll no likely gang back to ony\r\no\xc3\xad his auld howffs; he\xc3\xadll be off the country by this time. He has gude\r\nfriends some gate or other, for a\xc3\xad the life he\xc3\xads led; he\xc3\xads been weel\r\neducate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xadll grace the gallows the better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sharpitlaw; \xe2\x80\x9ca desperate\r\ndog, to murder an officer of the city for doing his duty! Wha kens wha\xc3\xads\r\nturn it might be next?--But you saw him plainly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs plainly as I see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was he dressed?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldna weel see; something of a woman\xc3\xads bit mutch on his head; but ye\r\nnever saw sic a ca\xc3\xad-throw. Ane couldna hae een to a\xc3\xad thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut did he speak to no one?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were a\xc3\xad speaking and gabbling through other,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, who\r\nwas obviously unwilling to carry his evidence farther than he could\r\npossibly help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will not do, Ratcliffe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must speak\r\n_out--out--out,_\xe2\x80\x9d tapping the table emphatically, as he repeated that\r\nimpressive monosyllable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads very hard, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prisoner; \xe2\x80\x9cand but for the\r\nunder-turnkey\xc3\xads place--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the reversion of the captaincy--the captaincy of the Tolbooth,\r\nman--that is, in case of gude behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cgude behaviour!--there\xc3\xads the deevil. And then\r\nit\xc3\xads waiting for dead folk\xc3\xads shoon into the bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Robertson\xc3\xads head will weigh something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw; \xe2\x80\x9csomething\r\ngey and heavy, Rat; the town maun show cause--that\xc3\xads right and\r\nreason--and then ye\xc3\xadll hae freedom to enjoy your gear honestly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xc3\xads a queer way of beginning the trade\r\nof honesty--but deil ma care. Weel, then, I heard and saw him speak to\r\nthe wench Effie Deans, that\xc3\xads up there for child-murder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deil ye did? Rat, this is finding a mare\xc3\xads nest wi\xc3\xad a witness.--And\r\nthe man that spoke to Butler in the Park, and that was to meet wi\xc3\xad Jeanie\r\nDeans at Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn--whew! lay that and that together? As sure as I\r\nlive he\xc3\xads been the father of the lassie\xc3\xads wean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere hae been waur guesses than that, I\xc3\xadm thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nRatcliffe, turning his quid of tobacco in his cheek, and squirting out\r\nthe juice. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard something a while syne about his drawing up wi\xc3\xad a\r\nbonny quean about the Pleasaunts, and that it was a\xc3\xad Wilson could do to\r\nkeep him frae marrying her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere a city officer entered, and told Sharpitlaw that they had the woman\r\nin custody whom he had directed them to bring before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads little matter now,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing is taking another turn;\r\nhowever, George, ye may bring her in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer retired, and introduced, upon his return, a tall, strapping\r\nwench of eighteen or twenty, dressed, fantastically, in a sort of blue\r\nriding-jacket, with tarnished lace, her hair clubbed like that of a man,\r\na Highland bonnet, and a bunch of broken feathers, a riding-skirt (or\r\npetticoat) of scarlet camlet, embroidered with tarnished flowers. Her\r\nfeatures were coarse and masculine, yet at a little distance, by dint of\r\nvery bright wild-looking black eyes, an aquiline nose, and a commanding\r\nprofile, appeared rather handsome. She flourished the switch she held in\r\nher hand, dropped a courtesy as low as a lady at a birth-night\r\nintroduction, recovered herself seemingly according to Touchstone\xc3\xads\r\ndirections to Audrey, and opened the conversation without waiting till\r\nany questions were asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod gie your honour gude-e\xc3\xaden, and mony o\xc3\xad them, bonny Mr.\r\nSharpitlaw!--Gude-e\xc3\xaden to ye, Daddie Ratton--they tauld me ye were\r\nhanged, man; or did ye get out o\xc3\xad John Dalgleish\xc3\xads hands like\r\nhalf-hangit Maggie Dickson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhisht, ye daft jaud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cand hear what\xc3\xads said to ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWi\xc3\xad a\xc3\xad my heart, Ratton. Great preferment for poor Madge to be brought\r\nup the street wi\xc3\xad a grand man, wi\xc3\xad a coat a\xc3\xad passemented wi\xc3\xad worset-lace,\r\nto speak wi\xc3\xad provosts, and bailies, and town-clerks, and prokitors, at\r\nthis time o\xc3\xad day--and the haill town looking at me too--This is honour on\r\nearth for ance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Madge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sharpitlaw, in a coaxing tone; \xe2\x80\x9cand ye\xc3\xadre dressed\r\nout in your braws, I see; these are not your every-days\xc3\xad claiths ye have\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeil be in my fingers, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge--\xe2\x80\x9cEh, sirs!\xe2\x80\x9d (observing Butler\r\ncome into the apartment), \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads a minister in the Tolbooth--wha will\r\nca\xc3\xad it a graceless place now?--I\xc3\xadse warrant he\xc3\xads in for the gude auld\r\ncause--but it\xc3\xads be nae cause o\xc3\xad mine,\xe2\x80\x9d and off she went into a song--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey for cavaliers, ho for cavaliers,\r\nDub a dub, dub a dub,\r\nHave at old Beelzebub,--\r\nOliver\xc3\xads squeaking for fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see that mad woman before?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw to Butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to my knowledge, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought as much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator-fiscal, looking towards\r\nRatcliffe, who answered his glance with a nod of acquiescence and\r\nintelligence.--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is Madge Wildfire, as she calls herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man of law\r\nto Butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, \xe2\x80\x9cand that I have been ever since I was\r\nsomething better--Heigh ho\xe2\x80\x9d--(and something like melancholy dwelt on her\r\nfeatures for a minute)--\xe2\x80\x9cBut I canna mind when that was--it was lang\r\nsyne, at ony rate, and I\xc3\xadll ne\xc3\xader fash my thumb about it.--\r\n\r\n           I glance like the wildfire through country and town;\r\n               I\xc3\xadm seen on the causeway--I\xc3\xadm seen on the down;\r\n           The lightning that flashes so bright and so free,\r\n               Is scarcely so blithe or so bonny as me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHand your tongue, ye skirling limmer!\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer who had acted as\r\nmaster of the ceremonies to this extraordinary performer, and who was\r\nrather scandalised at the freedom of her demeanour before a person of Mr.\r\nSharpitlaw\xc3\xads importance--\xe2\x80\x9chaud your tongue, or I\xc3\xadse gie ye something to\r\nskirl for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her alone, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cdinna put her out o\xc3\xad tune; I\r\nhae some questions to ask her--But first, Mr. Butler, take another look\r\nof her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo sae, minister--do sae,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madge; \xe2\x80\x9cI am as weel worth looking at\r\nas ony book in your aught.--And I can say the single carritch, and the\r\ndouble carritch, and justification, and effectual calling, and the\r\nassembly of divines at Westminster, that is\xe2\x80\x9d (she added in a low tone),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could say them ance--but it\xc3\xads lang syne--and ane forgets, ye ken.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\npoor Madge heaved another deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sharpitlaw to Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat think ye now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I did before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cthat I never saw the poor demented\r\ncreature in my life before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she is not the person whom you said the rioters last night\r\ndescribed as Madge Wildfire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cThey may be near the same height, for they\r\nare both tall, but I see little other resemblance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir dress, then, is not alike?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadge, my bonny woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, in the same coaxing manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat did ye do wi\xc3\xad your ilka-day\xc3\xads claise yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was ye yesterday at e\xc3\xaden, Madge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna mind ony thing about yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Madge;

but\r\nI think I could gar her tell us something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry her, then, Ratcliffe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am tired of her crazy\r\npate, and be d--d to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9chae ye ony joes now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn ony body ask ye, say ye dinna ken.--Set him to be speaking of my\r\njoes, auld Daddie Ratton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say, ye hae deil ane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee if I haena then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, with the toss of the head of affronted\r\nbeauty--\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads Rob the Ranter, and Will Fleming, and then there\xc3\xads\r\nGeordie Robertson, lad--that\xc3\xads Gentleman Geordie--what think ye o\xc3\xad that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRatcliffe laughed, and, winking to the procurator-fiscal, pursued the\r\ninquiry in his own way. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Madge, the lads only like ye when ye hae on\r\nyour braws--they wadna touch you wi\xc3\xad a pair o\xc3\xad tangs when you are in your\r\nauld ilka-day rags.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xc3\xadre a leeing auld sorrow then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the fair one; \xe2\x80\x9cfor Gentle\r\nGeordie Robertson put my ilka-day\xc3\xads claise on his ain bonny sell\r\nyestreen, and gaed a\xc3\xad through the town wi\xc3\xad them; and gawsie and grand he\r\nlookit, like ony queen in the land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna believe a word o\xc3\xadt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, with another wink to the\r\nprocurator. \xe2\x80\x9cThae duds were a\xc3\xad o\xc3\xad the colour o\xc3\xad moonshine in the water,\r\nI\xc3\xadm thinking, Madge--The gown wad be a sky-blue scarlet, I\xc3\xadse warrant\r\nye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nae sic thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, whose unretentive memory let out, in\r\nthe eagerness of contradiction, all that she would have most wished to\r\nkeep concealed, had her judgment been equal to her inclination. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nneither scarlet nor sky-blue, but my ain auld brown threshie-coat of a\r\nshort-gown, and my mother\xc3\xads auld mutch, and my red rokelay--and he gied\r\nme a croun and a kiss for the use o\xc3\xad them, blessing on his bonny\r\nface--though it\xc3\xads been a dear ane to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did he change his clothes again, hinnie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, in\r\nhis most conciliatory manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe procurator\xc3\xads spoiled a\xc3\xad,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Ratcliffe, drily. And it was even\r\nso; for the question, put in so direct a shape, immediately awakened\r\nMadge to the propriety of being reserved upon those very topics on which\r\nRatcliffe had indirectly seduced her to become communicative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was\xc3\xadt ye were speering at us, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, with an appearance\r\nof stolidity so speedily assumed, as showed there was a good deal of\r\nknavery mixed with her folly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator, \xe2\x80\x9cat what hour, and to what place,\r\nRobertson brought back your clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobertson?--Lord hand a care o\xc3\xad us! what Robertson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the fellow we were speaking of, Gentle Geordie, as you call him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeordie Gentle!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Madge, with well-feigned amazement--\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna\r\nken naebody they ca\xc3\xad Geordie Gentle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my jo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cthis will not do; you must tell us what\r\nyou did with these clothes of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadge Wildfire made no answer, unless the question may seem connected\r\nwith the snatch of a song with which she indulged the embarrassed\r\ninvestigator:--\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did ye wi\xc3\xad the bridal ring--bridal ring--bridal ring?\r\n      What did ye wi\xc3\xad your wedding ring, ye little cutty quean, O?\r\n             I gied it till a sodger, a sodger, a sodger,\r\n        I gied it till a sodger, an auld true love o\xc3\xad mine, O.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf all the madwomen who have sung and said, since the days of Hamlet the\r\nDane, if Ophelia be the most affecting, Madge Wildfire was the most\r\nprovoking.\r\n\r\nThe procurator-fiscal was in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll take some measures with this\r\nd--d Bess of Bedlam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat shall make her find her tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWi\xc3\xad your favour, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cbetter let her mind settle a\r\nlittle--Ye have aye made out something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the official person; \xe2\x80\x9ca brown short-gown, mutch, red\r\nrokelay--that agrees with your Madge Wildfire, Mr. Butler?\xe2\x80\x9d Butler agreed\r\nthat it did so. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there was a sufficient motive for taking this crazy\r\ncreature\xc3\xads dress and name, while he was about such a job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am free to say _now,_\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see it has come out without you,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Sharpitlaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust sae, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Ratcliffe. \xe2\x80\x9cI am free to say now, since it\xc3\xads\r\ncome out otherwise, that these were the clothes I saw Robertson wearing\r\nlast night in the jail, when he was at the head of the rioters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads direct evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cstick to that, Rat--I will\r\nreport favourably of you to the provost, for I have business for you\r\nto-night. It wears late; I must home and get a snack, and I\xc3\xadll be back in\r\nthe evening. Keep Madge with you, Ratcliffe, and try to get her into a\r\ngood tune again.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying he left the prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 And some they whistled--and some they sang,\r\n                         And some did loudly say,\r\n                 Whenever Lord Barnard\xc3\xads horn it blew,\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cAway, Musgrave away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                  Ballad of Little Musgrave.\r\n\r\nWhen the man of office returned to the Heart of Mid-Lothian, he resumed\r\nhis conference with Ratcliffe, of whose experience and assistance he now\r\nheld himself secure. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must speak with this wench, Rat--this Effie\r\nDeans--you must sift her a wee bit; for as sure as a tether she will ken\r\nRobertson\xc3\xads haunts--till her, Rat--till her without delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCraving your pardon, Mr. Sharpitlaw,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey elect, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xc3\xads\r\nwhat I am not free to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree to do, man? what the deil ails ye now?--I thought we had settled a\xc3\xad\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe; \xe2\x80\x9cI hae spoken to this Effie--she\xc3\xads\r\nstrange to this place and to its ways, and to a\xc3\xad our ways, Mr.\r\nSharpitlaw; and she greets, the silly tawpie, and she\xc3\xads breaking her\r\nheart already about this wild chield; and were she the mean\xc3\xads o\xc3\xad taking\r\nhim, she wad break it outright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wunna hae time, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cthe woodie will hae it\xc3\xads ain\r\no\xc3\xad her before that--a woman\xc3\xads heart takes a lang time o\xc3\xad breaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads according to the stuff they are made o\xc3\xad sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nRatcliffe--\xe2\x80\x9cBut to make a lang tale short, I canna undertake the job.\r\nIt gangs against my conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Your_ conscience, Rat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, with a sneer, which the reader\r\nwill probably think very natural upon the occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu ay, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ratcliffe, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cjust my conscience; a\xc3\xadbody has\r\na conscience, though it may be ill wunnin at it. I think mine\xc3\xads as weel\r\nout o\xc3\xad the gate as maist folk\xc3\xads are; and yet it\xc3\xads just like the noop of\r\nmy elbow, it whiles gets a bit dirl on a corner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, Rat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sharpitlaw, \xe2\x80\x9csince ye are nice, I\xc3\xadll speak to the\r\nhussy mysell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSharpitlaw, accordingly, caused himself to be introduced into the little\r\ndark apartment tenanted by the unfortunate Effie Deans. The poor girl was\r\nseated on her little flock-bed, plunged in a deep reverie. Some food\r\nstood on the table, of a quality better than is usually supplied to\r\nprisoners, but it was untouched. The person under whose care she was more\r\nparticularly placed, said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat sometimes she tasted naething from the\r\ntae end of the four-and-twenty hours to the t\xc3\xadother, except a drink of\r\nwater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSharpitlaw took a chair, and, commanding the turnkey to retire, he opened\r\nthe conversation, endeavouring to throw into his tone and countenance as\r\nmuch commiseration as they were capable of expressing, for the one was\r\nsharp and harsh, the other sly, acute, and selfish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad wi\xc3\xad ye, Effie?--How d\xc3\xadye find yoursell, hinny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep sigh was the only answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the folk civil to ye, Effie?--it\xc3\xads my duty to inquire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery civil, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, compelling herself to answer, yet hardly\r\nknowing what she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your victuals,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sharpitlaw, in the same condoling\r\ntone,--\xe2\x80\x9cdo you get what you like?--or is there onything you would\r\nparticularly fancy, as your health seems but silly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad very weel, sir, I thank ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor prisoner, in a tone\r\nhow different from the sportive vivacity of those of the Lily of St.\r\nLeonard\xc3\xads!--\xe2\x80\x9cit\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad very gude--ower gude for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been a great villain, Effie, who brought you to this pass,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Sharpitlaw.\r\n\r\nThe remark was dictated partly by a natural feeling, of which even he\r\ncould not divest himself, though accustomed to practise on the passions\r\nof others, and keep a most heedful guard over his own, and partly by his\r\nwish to introduce the sort of conversation which might, best serve his\r\nimmediate purpose. Indeed, upon the present occasion, these mixed motives\r\nof feeling and cunning harmonised together wonderfully; for, said\r\nSharpitlaw to himself, the greater rogue Robertson is, the more will be\r\nthe merit of bringing him to justice. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been a great villain,\r\nindeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he again reiterated; \xe2\x80\x9cand I wish I had the skelping o\xc3\xad him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may blame mysell mair than him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie; \xe2\x80\x9cI was bred up to ken\r\nbetter; but he, poor fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d--(she stopped).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas a thorough blackguard a\xc3\xad his life, I dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stranger he was in this country, and a companion of that lawless\r\nvagabond, Wilson, I think, Effie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wad hae been dearly telling him that he had ne\xc3\xader seen Wilson\xc3\xads\r\nface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads very true that you are saying, Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nwas\xc3\xadt that Robertson and you were used to howff thegither? Somegate about\r\nthe Laigh Calton, I am thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe simple and dispirited girl had thus far followed Mr. Sharpitlaw\xc3\xads\r\nlead, because he had artfully adjusted his observations to the thoughts\r\nhe was pretty certain must be passing through her own mind, so that her\r\nanswers became a kind of thinking aloud, a mood into which those who are\r\neither constitutionally absent in mind, or are rendered so by the\r\ntemporary pressure of misfortune, may be easily led by a skilful train of\r\nsuggestions. But the last observation of the procurator-fiscal was too\r\nmuch of the nature of a direct interrogatory, and it broke the charm\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it that I was saying?\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, starting up from her\r\nreclining posture, seating herself upright, and hastily shading her\r\ndishevelled hair back from her wasted but still beautiful countenance.\r\nShe fixed her eyes boldly and keenly upon Sharpitlaw--\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too much\r\nof a gentleman, sir,--too much of an honest man, to take any notice of\r\nwhat a poor creature like me says, that can hardly ca\xc3\xad my senses my\r\nain--God help me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdvantage!--I would be of some advantage to you if I could,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSharpitlaw, in a soothing tone; \xe2\x80\x9cand I ken naething sae likely to serve\r\nye, Effie, as gripping this rascal, Robertson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dinna misca\xc3\xad him, sir, that never misca\xc3\xadd you!--Robertson?--I am sure\r\nI had naething to say against ony man o\xc3\xad the name, and naething will I\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you do not heed your own misfortune, Effie, you should mind what\r\ndistress he has brought on your family,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man of law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Heaven help me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed poor Effie--\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor father--my dear\r\nJeanie--O, that\xc3\xads sairest to bide of a\xc3\xad! O, sir, if you hae ony\r\nkindness--if ye hae ony touch of compassion--for a\xc3\xad the folk I see here\r\nare as hard as the wa\xc3\xad-stanes--If ye wad but bid them let my sister\r\nJeanie in the next time she ca\xc3\xads! for when I hear them put her awa frae\r\nthe door, and canna climb up to that high window to see sae muckle as\r\nher gown-tail, it\xc3\xads like to pit me out o\xc3\xad my judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked\r\non him with a face of entreaty, so earnest, yet so humble, that she\r\nfairly shook the steadfast purpose of his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see your sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xc3\xadll tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d--then\r\ninterrupting himself, he added, in a more hurried tone,--\xe2\x80\x9cno, d--n it,\r\nyou shall see your sister whether you tell me anything or no.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying,\r\nhe rose up and left the apartment.\r\n\r\nWhen he had rejoined Ratcliffe, he observed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Ratton;\r\nthere\xc3\xads no making much of that lassie. But ae thing I have cleared--that\r\nis, that Robertson has been the father of the bairn, and so I will wager\r\na boddle it will be he that\xc3\xads to meet wi\xc3\xad Jeanie Deans this night at\r\nMuschat\xc3\xads Cairn, and there we\xc3\xadll nail him, Rat, or my name is not Gideon\r\nSharpitlaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, perhaps because he was in no hurry to see anything\r\nwhich was like to be connected with the discovery and apprehension of\r\nRobertson, \xe2\x80\x9can that were the case, Mr. Butler wad hae kend the man in the\r\nKing\xc3\xads Park to be the same person wi\xc3\xad him in Madge Wildfire\xc3\xads claise,\r\nthat headed the mob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes nae difference, man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sharpitlaw--\xe2\x80\x9cthe dress, the\r\nlight, the confusion, and maybe a touch o\xc3\xad a blackit cork, or a slake o\xc3\xad\r\npaint-hout, Ratton, I have seen ye dress your ainsell, that the deevil ye\r\nbelang to durstna hae made oath t\xc3\xadye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xc3\xads true, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides, ye donnard carle,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sharpitlaw, triumphantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nminister _did_ say that he thought he knew something of the features of\r\nthe birkie that spoke to him in the Park, though he could not charge his\r\nmemory where or when he had seen them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads evident, then, your honour will be right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Rat, you and I will go with the party oursells this night, and see\r\nhim in grips or we are done wi\xc3\xad him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seena muckle use I can be o\xc3\xad to your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe,\r\nreluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUse?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sharpitlaw--\xe2\x80\x9cYou can guide the party--you ken the ground.\r\nBesides, I do not intend to quit sight o\xc3\xad you, my good friend, till I\r\nhave him in hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, but in no joyful tone of acquiescence; \xe2\x80\x9cYe\r\nmaun hae it your ain way--but mind he\xc3\xads a desperate man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have that with us,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sharpitlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will settle him,\r\nif it is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I couldna undertake to guide\r\nyou to Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn in the night-time; I ken the place as mony does,\r\nin fair day-light, but how to find it by moonshine, amang sae mony crags\r\nand stanes, as like to each other as the collier to the deil, is mair\r\nthan I can tell. I might as soon seek moonshine in water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xc3\xads the meaning o\xc3\xad this, Ratcliffe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, while he fixed\r\nhis eye on the recusant, with a fatal and ominous expression,--\xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nforgotten that you are still under sentence of death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xc3\xads a thing no easily put out o\xc3\xad memory;\r\nand if my presence be judged necessary, nae doubt I maun gang wi\xc3\xad your\r\nhonour. But I was gaun to tell your honour of ane that has mair skeel o\xc3\xad\r\nthe gate than me, and that\xc3\xads e\xc3\xaden Madge Wildfire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil she has!--Do you think me as mad as she, is, to trust to her\r\nguidance on such an occasion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honour is the best judge,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ratcliffe; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I ken I can\r\nkeep her in tune, and garr her haud the straight path--she often sleeps\r\nout, or rambles about amang thae hills the haill simmer night, the daft\r\nlimmer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, Ratcliffe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the procurator-fiscal, \xe2\x80\x9cif you think she can\r\nguide us the right way--but take heed to what you are about--your life\r\ndepends on your behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads a sair judgment on a man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he has ance gane\r\nsae far wrang as I hae done, that deil a bit he can be honest, try\xc3\xadt\r\nwhilk way he will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the reflection of Ratcliffe, when he was left for a few minutes\r\nto himself, while the retainer of justice went to procure a proper\r\nwarrant, and give the necessary directions.\r\n\r\nThe rising moon saw the whole party free from the walls of the city, and\r\nentering upon the open ground. Arthur\xc3\xads Seat, like a couchant lion of\r\nimmense size--Salisbury Crags, like a huge belt or girdle of granite,\r\nwere dimly visible. Holding their path along the southern side of the\r\nCanongate, they gained the Abbey of Holyrood House, and from thence found\r\ntheir way by step and stile into the King\xc3\xads Park. They were at first four\r\nin number--an officer of justice and Sharpitlaw, who were well armed with\r\npistols and cutlasses; Ratcliffe, who was not trusted with weapons, lest,\r\nhe might, peradventure, have used them on the wrong side; and the female.\r\nBut at the last stile, when they entered the Chase, they were joined by\r\nother two officers, whom Sharpitlaw, desirous to secure sufficient force\r\nfor his purpose, and at the same time to avoid observation, had directed\r\nto wait for him at this place. Ratcliffe saw this accession of strength\r\nwith some disquietude, for he had hitherto thought it likely that\r\nRobertson, who was a bold, stout, and active young fellow, might have\r\nmade his escape from Sharpitlaw and the single officer, by force or\r\nagility, without his being implicated in the matter. But the present\r\nstrength of the followers of justice was overpowering, and the only mode\r\nof saving Robertson (which the old sinner was well disposed to do,\r\nproviding always he could accomplish his purpose without compromising his\r\nown safety), must be by contriving that he should have some signal of\r\ntheir approach. It was probably with this view that Ratcliffe had\r\nrequested the addition of Madge to the party, having considerable\r\nconfidence in her propensity to exert her lungs. Indeed, she had already\r\ngiven them so many specimens of her clamorous loquacity, that Sharpitlaw\r\nhalf determined to send her back with one of the officers, rather than\r\ncarry forward in his company a person so extremely ill qualified to be a\r\nguide in a secret expedition. It seemed, too, as if the open air, the\r\napproach to the hills, and the ascent of the moon, supposed to be so\r\nportentous over those whose brain is infirm, made her spirits rise in a\r\ndegree tenfold more loquacious than she had hitherto exhibited. To\r\nsilence her by fair means seemed impossible; authoritative commands and\r\ncoaxing entreaties she set alike at defiance, and threats only made her\r\nsulky and altogether intractable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no one of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat knows the\r\nway to this accursed place--this Nichol Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn--excepting this\r\nmad clavering idiot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeil ane o\xc3\xad them kens it except mysell,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madge; \xe2\x80\x9chow suld\r\nthey, the puir fule cowards! But I hae sat on the grave frae batfleeing\r\ntime till cook-crow, and had mony a fine crack wi\xc3\xad Muschat and Ailie\r\nMuschat, that are lying sleeping below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take your crazy brain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cwill you not allow\r\nthe men to answer a question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officers obtaining a moment\xc3\xads audience while Ratcliffe diverted\r\nMadge\xc3\xads attention, declared that, though they had a general knowledge of\r\nthe spot, they could not undertake to guide the party to it by the\r\nuncertain light of the moon, with such accuracy as to insure success to\r\ntheir expedition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do, Ratcliffe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cif he sees us before we\r\nsee him,--and that\xc3\xads what he is certain to do, if we go strolling about,\r\nwithout keeping the straight road,--we may bid gude day to the job, and I\r\nwould rather lose one hundred pounds, baith for the credit of the police,\r\nand because the provost says somebody maun be hanged for this job o\xc3\xad\r\nPorteous, come o\xc3\xadt what likes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cwe maun just try Madge; and I\xc3\xadll see if I can\r\nget her keepit in ony better order. And at ony rate, if he suld hear her\r\nskirting her auld ends o\xc3\xad sangs, he\xc3\xads no to ken for that that there\xc3\xads\r\nonybody wi\xc3\xad her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cand if he thinks her alone, he\xc3\xads as like\r\nto come towards her as to rin frae her. So set forward--we hae lost ower\r\nmuckle time already--see to get her to keep the right road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what sort o\xc3\xad house does Nichol Muschat and his wife keep now?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRatcliffe to the mad woman, by way of humouring her vein of folly; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nwere but thrawn folk lang syne, an a\xc3\xad tales be true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu, ay, ay, ay--but a\xc3\xads forgotten now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Madge, in the\r\nconfidential tone of a gossip giving the history of her next-door\r\nneighbour--\xe2\x80\x9cYe see, I spoke to them mysell, and tauld them byganes suld\r\nbe byganes--her throat\xc3\xads sair misguggled and mashackered though; she\r\nwears her corpse-sheet drawn weel up to hide it, but that canna hinder\r\nthe bluid seiping through, ye ken. I wussed her to wash it in St.\r\nAnthony\xc3\xads Well, and that will cleanse if onything can--But they say bluid\r\nnever bleaches out o\xc3\xad linen claith--Deacon Sanders\xc3\xads new cleansing draps\r\nwinna do\xc3\xadt--I tried them mysell on a bit rag we hae at hame that was\r\nmailed wi\xc3\xad the bluid of a bit skirting wean that was hurt some gate, but\r\nout it winna come--Weel, yell say that\xc3\xads queer; but I will bring it out\r\nto St. Anthony\xc3\xads blessed Well some braw night just like this, and I\xc3\xadll\r\ncry up Ailie Muschat, and she and I will hae a grand bouking-washing, and\r\nbleach our claes in the beams of the bonny Lady Moon, that\xc3\xads far\r\npleasanter to me than the sun--the sun\xc3\xads ower het, and ken ye, cummers,\r\nmy brains are het eneugh already. But the moon, and the dew, and the\r\nnight-wind, they are just like a caller kail-blade laid on my brow; and\r\nwhiles I think the moon just shines on purpose to pleasure me, when\r\nnaebody sees her but mysell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis raving discourse she continued with prodigious volubility, walking\r\non at a great pace, and dragging Ratcliffe along with her, while he\r\nendeavoured, in appearance at least, if not in reality, to induce her to\r\nmoderate her voice.\r\n\r\nAll at once she stopped short upon the top of a little hillock, gazed\r\nupward fixedly, and said not one word for the space of five minutes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil is the matter with her now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw to\r\nRatcliffe--\xe2\x80\x9cCan you not get her forward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe maun just take a grain o\xc3\xad patience wi\xc3\xad her, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xc3\xadll no gae a foot faster than she likes herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--n her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll take care she has her time in Bedlam\r\nor Bridewell, or both, for she\xc3\xads both mad and mischievous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Madge, who had looked very pensive when she first\r\nstopped, suddenly burst into a vehement fit of laughter, then paused and\r\nsighed bitterly,--then was seized with a second fit of laughter--then,\r\nfixing her eyes on the moon, lifted up her voice and sung,--\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cGood even, good fair moon, good even to thee;\r\n                 I prithee, dear moon, now show to me\r\n             The form and the features, the speech and degree,\r\n                 Of the man that true lover of mine shall be.\r\n\r\nBut I need not ask that of the bonny Lady Moon--I ken that weel eneugh\r\nmysell--_true_-love though he wasna--But naebody shall sae that I ever\r\ntauld a word about the matter--But whiles I wish the bairn had\r\nlived--Weel, God guide us, there\xc3\xads a heaven aboon us a\xc3\xad,\xe2\x80\x9d--(here she\r\nsighed bitterly), \xe2\x80\x9cand a bonny moon, and sterns in it forby\xe2\x80\x9d (and here\r\nshe laughed once more).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we to stand, here all night!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, very impatiently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrag her forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cif we kend whilk way to drag her, that would\r\nsettle it at ance.--Come, Madge, hinny,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing her, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xc3\xadll no be in\r\ntime to see Nichol and his wife, unless ye show us the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn troth and that I will, Ratton,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, seizing him by the arm, and\r\nresuming her route with huge strides, considering it was a female who\r\ntook them. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xc3\xadll tell ye, Ratton, blithe will Nichol Muschat be to\r\nsee ye, for he says he kens weel there isna sic a villain out o\xc3\xad hell as\r\nye are, and he wad be ravished to hae a crack wi\xc3\xad you--like to like ye\r\nken--it\xc3\xads a proverb never fails--and ye are baith a pair o\xc3\xad the deevil\xc3\xads\r\npeats I trow--hard to ken whilk deserves the hettest corner o\xc3\xad his\r\ningle-side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRatcliffe was conscience-struck, and could not forbear making an\r\ninvoluntary protest against this classification. \xe2\x80\x9cI never shed blood,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ye hae sauld it, Ratton--ye hae sauld blood mony a time. Folk kill\r\nwi\xc3\xad the tongue as weel as wi\xc3\xad the hand--wi\xc3\xad the word as weel as wi\xc3\xad the\r\ngulley!--\r\n\r\n                     It is the \xc3\xabbonny butcher lad,\r\n                     That wears the sleeves of blue,\r\n                     He sells the flesh on Saturday,\r\n                         On Friday that he slew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that I ain doing now?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ratcliffe. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xc3\xadll hae nae\r\nwyte of Robertson\xc3\xads young bluid, if I can help it;\xe2\x80\x9d then speaking apart\r\nto Madge, he asked her, \xe2\x80\x9cWhether she did not remember ony o\xc3\xad her auld\r\nSangs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMony a dainty ane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge; \xe2\x80\x9cand blithely can I sing them, for\r\nlightsome sangs make merry gate.\xe2\x80\x9d And she sang,--\r\n\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the glede\xc3\xads in the blue cloud,\r\n                        The lavrock lies still;\r\n                  When the hound\xc3\xads in the greenwood.\r\n                       The hind keeps the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence her cursed noise, if you should throttle her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see somebody yonder.--Keep close, my boys, and creep round the\r\nshoulder of the height. George Poinder, stay you with Ratcliffe and tha\r\nmad yelling bitch; and you other two, come with me round under the shadow\r\nof the brae.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he crept forward with the stealthy pace of an Indian savage, who\r\nleads his band to surprise an unsuspecting party of some hostile tribe.\r\nRatcliffe saw them glide of, avoiding the moonlight, and keeping as much\r\nin: the shade as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobertson\xc3\xads done up,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cthae young lads are aye sae\r\nthoughtless. What deevil could he hae to say to Jeanie Deans, or to ony\r\nwoman on earth, that he suld gang awa and get his neck raxed for her? And\r\nthis mad quean, after cracking like a pen-gun, and skirling like a\r\npea-hen for the haill night, behoves just to hae hadden her tongue when\r\nher clavers might have dune some gude! But it\xc3\xads aye the way wi\xc3\xad women; if\r\nthey ever hand their tongues ava\xc3\xad, ye may swear it\xc3\xads for mischief. I wish\r\nI could set her on again without this blood-sucker kenning what I am\r\ndoing. But he\xc3\xads as gleg as MacKeachan\xc3\xads elshin,* that ran through sax\r\nplies of bendleather and half-an-inch into the king\xc3\xads heel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* [_Elshin,_ a shoemaker\xc3\xads awl.]\r\n\r\nHe then began to hum, but in a very low and suppressed tone, the first\r\nstanza of a favourite ballad of Wildfire\xc3\xads, the words of which bore some\r\ndistant analogy with the situation of Robertson, trusting that the power\r\nof association would not fail to bring the rest to her mind:--\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xc3\xads a bloodhound ranging Tinwald wood,\r\n                      There\xc3\xads harness glancing sheen:\r\n                There\xc3\xads a maiden sits on Tinwald brae,\r\n                      And she sings loud between.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadge had no sooner received the catch-word, than she vindicated\r\nRatcliffe\xc3\xads sagacity by setting off at score with the song:--\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cO sleep ye sound, Sir James, she said,\r\n                      When ye suld rise and ride?\r\n                There\xc3\xads twenty men, wi\xc3\xad bow and blade,\r\n                      Are seeking where ye hide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough Ratcliffe was at a considerable distance from the spot called\r\nMuschat\xc3\xads Cairn, yet his eyes, practised like those of a cat to penetrate\r\ndarkness, could mark that Robertson had caught the alarm. George Poinder,\r\nless keen of sight, or less attentive, was not aware of his flight any\r\nmore than Sharpitlaw and his assistants, whose view, though they were\r\nconsiderably nearer to the cairn, was intercepted by the broken nature of\r\nthe ground under which they were screening themselves. At length,\r\nhowever, after the interval of five or six minutes, they also perceived\r\nthat Robertson had fled, and rushed hastily towards the place, while\r\nSharpitlaw called out aloud, in the harshest tones of a voice which\r\nresembled a saw-mill at work, \xe2\x80\x9cChase, lads--chase--haud the brae--I see\r\nhim on the edge of the hill!\xe2\x80\x9d Then hollowing back to the rear-guard of\r\nhis detachment, he issued his farther orders: \xe2\x80\x9cRatcliffe, come here, and\r\ndetain the woman--George, run and kepp the stile at the Duke\xc3\xads\r\nWalk--Ratcliffe, come here directly--but first knock out that mad\r\nbitch\xc3\xads brains!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe had better rin for it, Madge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it\xc3\xads ill dealing\r\nwi\xc3\xad an angry man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadge Wildfire was not so absolutely void of common sense as not to\r\nunderstand this innuendo; and while Ratcliffe, in seemingly anxious haste\r\nof obedience, hastened to the spot where Sharpitlaw waited to deliver up\r\nJeanie Deans to his custody, she fled with all the despatch she could\r\nexert in an opposite direction. Thus the whole party were separated, and\r\nin rapid motion of flight or pursuit, excepting Ratcliffe and Jeanie,\r\nwhom, although making no attempt to escape, he held fast by the cloak,\r\nand who remained standing by Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n               You have paid the heavens your function,\r\n               and the prisoner the very debt of your calling.\r\n                          Measure for Measure.\r\n\r\nJeanie Deans,--for here our story unites itself with that part of the\r\nnarrative which broke off at the end of the fourteenth chapter,--while\r\nshe waited, in terror and amazement, the hasty advance of three or four\r\nmen towards her, was yet more startled at their suddenly breaking\r\nasunder, and giving chase in different directions to the late object of\r\nher terror, who became at that moment, though she could not well assign a\r\nreasonable cause, rather the cause of her interest. One of the party (it\r\nwas Sharpitlaw) came straight up to her, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYour name is Jeanie\r\nDeans, and you are my prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d immediately added, \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you will tell\r\nme which way he ran I will let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d was all the poor girl could utter; and, indeed, it is\r\nthe phrase which rises most readily to the lips of any person in her\r\nrank, as the readiest reply to any embarrassing question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cye _ken_ wha it was ye were speaking wi\xc3\xad, my\r\nleddy, on the hill side, and midnight sae near; ye surely ken _that,_ my\r\nbonny woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d again iterated Jeanie, who really did not comprehend\r\nin her terror the nature of the questions which were so hastily put to\r\nher in this moment of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will try to mend your memory by and by, hinny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw, and\r\nshouted, as we have already told the reader, to Ratcliffe, to come up and\r\ntake charge of her, while he himself directed the chase after Robertson,\r\nwhich he still hoped might be successful. As Ratcliffe approached,\r\nSharpitlaw pushed the young woman towards him with some rudeness, and\r\nbetaking himself to the more important object of his quest, began to\r\nscale crags and scramble up steep banks, with an agility of which his\r\nprofession and his general gravity of demeanour would previously have\r\nargued him incapable. In a few minutes there was no one within sight, and\r\nonly a distant halloo from one of the pursuers to the other, faintly\r\nheard on the side of the hill, argued that there was any one within\r\nhearing. Jeanie Deans was left in the clear moonlight, standing under the\r\nguard of a person of whom she knew nothing, and, what was worse,\r\nconcerning whom, as the reader is well aware, she could have learned\r\nnothing that would not have increased her terror.\r\n\r\nWhen all in the distance was silent, Ratcliffe for the first time\r\naddressed her, and it was in that cold sarcastic indifferent tone\r\nfamiliar to habitual depravity, whose crimes are instigated by custom\r\nrather than by passion. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a braw night for ye, dearie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nattempting to pass his arm across her shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cto be on the green hill\r\nwi\xc3\xad your jo.\xe2\x80\x9d Jeanie extricated herself from his grasp, but did not make\r\nany reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think lads and lasses,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the ruffian, \xe2\x80\x9cdinna meet at\r\nMuschat\xc3\xads Cairn at midnight to crack nuts,\xe2\x80\x9d and he again attempted to\r\ntake hold of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ye are an officer of justice, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, again eluding his\r\nattempt to seize her, \xe2\x80\x9cye deserve to have your coat stripped from your\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, hinny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, succeeding forcibly in his attempt to get\r\nhold of her, \xe2\x80\x9cbut suppose I should strip your cloak off first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are more a man, I am sure, than to hurt me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nGod\xc3\xads sake have pity on a half-distracted creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xc3\xadre a good-looking wench, and should\r\nnot be cross-grained. I was going to be an honest man--but the devil has\r\nthis very day flung first a lawyer, and then a woman, in my gate. I\xc3\xadll\r\ntell you what, Jeanie, they are out on the hill-side--if you\xc3\xadll be guided\r\nby me, I\xc3\xadll carry you to a wee bit corner in the Pleasance, that I ken o\xc3\xad\r\nin an auld wife\xc3\xads, that a\xc3\xad the prokitors o\xc3\xad Scotland wot naething o\xc3\xad, and\r\nwe\xc3\xadll send Robertson word to meet us in Yorkshire, for there is a set o\xc3\xad\r\nbraw lads about the midland counties, that I hae dune business wi\xc3\xad before\r\nnow, and sae we\xc3\xadll leave Mr. Sharpitlaw to whistle on his thumb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for Jeanie, in an emergency like the present, that she\r\npossessed presence of mind and courage, so soon as the first hurry of\r\nsurprise had enabled her to rally her recollection. She saw the risk she\r\nwas in from a ruffian, who not only was such by profession, but had that\r\nevening been stupifying, by means of strong liquors, the internal\r\naversion which he felt at the business on which Sharpitlaw had resolved\r\nto employ him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinna speak sae loud,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a low voice; \xe2\x80\x9che\xc3\xads up yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?--Robertson?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cup yonder;\xe2\x80\x9d and she pointed to the ruins of the\r\nhermitage and chapel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy G--d, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll make my ain of him, either one way\r\nor other--wait for me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no sooner had he set off as fast as he could run, towards the chapel,\r\nthan Jeanie started in an opposite direction, over high and low, on the\r\nnearest path homeward. Her juvenile exercise as a herdswoman had put\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clife and mettle\xe2\x80\x9d in her heels, and never had she followed Dustiefoot,\r\nwhen the cows were in the corn, with half so much speed as she now\r\ncleared the distance betwixt Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn and her father\xc3\xads cottage at\r\nSt. Leonard\xc3\xads. To lift the latch--to enter--to shut, bolt, and double\r\nbolt the door--to draw against it a heavy article of furniture (which she\r\ncould not have moved in a moment of less energy), so as to make yet\r\nfarther provision against violence, was almost the work of a moment, yet\r\ndone with such silence as equalled the celerity.\r\n\r\nHer next anxiety was upon her father\xc3\xads account, and she drew silently to\r\nthe door of his apartment, in order to satisfy herself whether he had\r\nbeen disturbed by her return. He was awake,--probably had slept but\r\nlittle; but the constant presence of his own sorrows, the distance of his\r\napartment from the outer door of the house, and the precautions which\r\nJeanie had taken to conceal her departure and return, had prevented him\r\nfrom being sensible of either. He was engaged in his devotions, and\r\nJeanie could distinctly hear him use these words:--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for the other\r\nchild thou hast given me to be a comfort and stay to my old age, may her\r\ndays be long in the land, according to the promise thou hast given to\r\nthose who shall honour father and mother; may all her purchased and\r\npromised blessings be multiplied upon her; keep her in the watches of the\r\nnight, and in the uprising of the morning, that all in this land may know\r\nthat thou hast not utterly hid thy face from those that seek thee in\r\ntruth and in sincerity.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent, but probably continued his\r\npetition in the strong fervency of mental devotion.\r\n\r\nHis daughter retired to her apartment, comforted, that while she was\r\nexposed to danger, her head had been covered by the prayers of the just\r\nas by an helmet, and under the strong confidence, that while she walked\r\nworthy of the protection of Heaven, she would experience its countenance.\r\nIt was in that moment that a vague idea first darted across her mind,\r\nthat something might yet be achieved for her sister\xc3\xads safety, conscious\r\nas she now was of her innocence of the unnatural murder with which she\r\nstood charged. It came, as she described it, on her mind, like a\r\nsun-blink on a stormy sea; and although it instantly vanished, yet she\r\nfelt a degree of composure which she had not experienced for many days,\r\nand could not help being strongly persuaded that, by some means or other,\r\nshe would be called upon, and directed, to work out her sister\xc3\xads\r\ndeliverance. She went to bed, not forgetting her usual devotions, the\r\nmore fervently made on account of her late deliverance, and she slept\r\nsoundly in spite of her agitation.\r\n\r\nWe must return to Ratcliffe, who had started, like a greyhound from the\r\nslips when the sportsman cries halloo, as soon as Jeanie had pointed to\r\nthe ruins. Whether he meant to aid Robertson\xc3\xads escape, or to assist his\r\npursuers, may be very doubtful; perhaps he did not himself know but had\r\nresolved to be guided by circumstances. He had no opportunity, however,\r\nof doing either; for he had no sooner surmounted the steep ascent, and\r\nentered under the broken arches of the rains, than a pistol was presented\r\nat his head, and a harsh voice commanded him, in the king\xc3\xads name, to\r\nsurrender himself prisoner. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sharpitlaw!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, surprised,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis this your honour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it only you, and be d--d to you?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the fiscal, still more\r\ndisappointed--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat made you leave the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me she saw Robertson go into the ruins, so I made what haste I\r\ncould to cleek the callant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads all over now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see no more of him\r\nto-night; but he shall hide himself in a bean-hool, if he remains on\r\nScottish ground without my finding him. Call back the people, Ratcliffe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRatcliffe hollowed to the dispersed officers, who willingly obeyed the\r\nsignal; for probably there was no individual among them who would have\r\nbeen much desirous of a rencontre, hand to hand, and at a distance from\r\nhis comrades, with such an active and desperate fellow as Robertson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where are the two women?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth made their heels serve them, I suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ratcliffe, and he\r\nhummed the end of the old song--\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cThen hey play up the rin-awa bride,\r\n                       For she has taen the gee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharpitlaw,--for, like all rogues, he was a great\r\ncalumniator of the fair sex,*--\xe2\x80\x9cone woman is enough to dark the fairest\r\nploy that was ever planned; and how could I be such an ass as to expect\r\nto carry through a job that had two in it?\r\n\r\n* Note L. Calumniator of the Fair Sex.\r\n\r\nBut we know how to come by them both, if they are wanted, that\xc3\xads one good\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, like a defeated general, sad and sulky, he led back his\r\ndiscomfited forces to the metropolis, and dismissed them for the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning early, he was under the necessity of making his report\r\nto the sitting magistrate of the day. The gentleman who occupied the\r\nchair of office on this occasion (for the bailies, _Anglice\xc3\xad,_ aldermen,\r\ntake it by rotation) chanced to be the same by whom Butler was committed,\r\na person very generally respected among his fellow-citizens. Something he\r\nwas of a humorist, and rather deficient in general education; but acute,\r\npatient, and upright, possessed of a fortune acquired by honest industry\r\nwhich made him perfectly independent; and, in short, very happily\r\nqualified to support the respectability of the office, which he held.\r\n\r\nMr. Middleburgh had just taken his seat, and was debating in an animated\r\nmanner, with one of his colleagues, the doubtful chances of a game at\r\ngolf which they had played the day before, when a letter was delivered to\r\nhim, addressed \xe2\x80\x9cFor Bailie Middleburgh; These: to be forwarded with\r\nspeed.\xe2\x80\x9d It contained these words:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,--I know you to be a sensible and a considerate magistrate, and one\r\nwho, as such, will be content to worship God, though the devil bid you. I\r\ntherefore expect that, notwithstanding the signature of this letter\r\nacknowledges my share in an action, which, in a proper time and place, I\r\nwould not fear either to avow or to justify, you will not on that account\r\nreject what evidence I place before you. The clergyman, Butler, is\r\ninnocent of all but involuntary presence at an action which he wanted\r\nspirit to approve of, and from which he endeavoured, with his best set\r\nphrases, to dissuade us. But it was not for him that it is my hint to\r\nspeak. There is a woman in your jail, fallen under the edge of a law so\r\ncruel, that it has hung by the wall like unsecured armour, for twenty\r\nyears, and is now brought down and whetted to spill the blood of the most\r\nbeautiful and most innocent creature whom the walls of a prison ever\r\ngirdled in. Her sister knows of her innocence, as she communicated to her\r\nthat she was betrayed by a villain.--O that high Heaven\r\n\r\n                Would put in every honest hand a whip,\r\n                To scourge me such a villain through the world!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write distractedly--But this girl--this Jeanie Deans, is a peevish\r\npuritan, superstitious and scrupulous after the manner of her sect; and I\r\npray your honour, for so my phrase must go, to press upon her, that her\r\nsister\xc3\xads life depends upon her testimony. But though she should remain\r\nsilent, do not dare to think that the young woman is guilty--far less to\r\npermit her execution. Remember the death of Wilson was fearfully avenged;\r\nand those yet live who can compel you to drink the dregs of your poisoned\r\nchalice.--I say, remember Porteous, and say that you had good counsel\r\nfrom\r\n                          \xe2\x80\x9cOne of his Slayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate read over this extraordinary letter twice or thrice. At\r\nfirst he was tempted to throw it aside as the production of a madman, so\r\nlittle did \xe2\x80\x9cthe scraps from play-books,\xe2\x80\x9d as he termed the poetical\r\nquotation, resemble the correspondence of a rational being. On a\r\nre-perusal, however, he thought that, amid its incoherence, he could\r\ndiscover something like a tone of awakened passion, though expressed in a\r\nmanner quaint and unusual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a cruelly severe statute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate to his assistant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I wish the girl could be taken from under the letter of it. A child\r\nmay have been born, and it may have been conveyed away while the mother\r\nwas insensible, or it may have perished for want of that relief which the\r\npoor creature herself--helpless, terrified, distracted, despairing, and\r\nexhausted--may have been unable to afford to it. And yet it is certain,\r\nif the woman is found guilty under the statute, execution will follow.\r\nThe crime has been too common, and examples are necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if this other wench,\xe2\x80\x9d said the city-clerk, \xe2\x80\x9ccan speak to her sister\r\ncommunicating her situation, it will take the case from under the\r\nstatute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9cand I will walk out one of these days\r\nto St. Leonard\xc3\xads, and examine the girl myself. I know something of their\r\nfather Deans--an old true-blue Cameronian, who would see house and family\r\ngo to wreck ere he would disgrace his testimony by a sinful complying\r\nwith the defections of the times; and such he will probably uphold the\r\ntaking an oath before a civil magistrate. If they are to go on and\r\nflourish with their bull-headed obstinacy, the legislature must pass an\r\nact to take their affirmations, as in the case of Quakers. But surely\r\nneither a father nor a sister will scruple in a case of this kind. As I\r\nsaid before, I will go speak with them myself, when the hurry of this\r\nPorteous investigation is somewhat over; their pride and spirit of\r\ncontradiction will be far less alarmed, than if they were called into a\r\ncourt of justice at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I suppose Butler is to remain incarcerated?\xe2\x80\x9d said the city-clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the present, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope soon to\r\nset him at liberty upon bail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you rest upon the testimony of that light-headed letter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very much,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Bailie; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet there is something\r\nstriking about it too--it seems the letter of a man beside himself,\r\neither from great agitation, or some great sense of guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the town-clerk, \xe2\x80\x9cit is very like the letter of a mad\r\nstrolling play-actor, who deserves to be hanged with all the rest of his\r\ngang, as your honour justly observes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not quite so bloodthirsty,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x9cBut to the\r\npoint, Butler\xc3\xads private character is excellent; and I am given to\r\nunderstand, by some inquiries I have been making this morning, that he\r\ndid actually arrive in town only the day before yesterday, so that it was\r\nimpossible he could have been concerned in any previous machinations of\r\nthese unhappy rioters, and it is not likely that he should have joined\r\nthem on a suddenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xc3\xads no saying anent that--zeal catches fire at a slight spark as\r\nfast as a brunstane match,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the secretary. \xe2\x80\x9cI hae kend a\r\nminister wad be fair gude-day and fair gude-e\xc3\xaden wi\xc3\xad ilka man in the\r\nparochine, and hing just as quiet as a rocket on a stick, till ye\r\nmentioned the word abjuration-oath, or patronage, or siclike, and then,\r\nwhiz, he was off, and up in the air an hundred miles beyond common\r\nmanners, common sense, and common comprehension.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the burgher-magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the young\r\nman Butler\xc3\xads zeal is of so inflammable a character. But I will make\r\nfarther investigation. What other business is there before us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they proceeded to minute investigations concerning the affair of\r\nPorteous\xc3\xads death, and other affairs through which this history has no\r\noccasion to trace them.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their business they were interrupted by an old woman of\r\nthe lower rank, extremely haggard in look, and wretched in her\r\nappearance, who thrust herself into the council room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, gudewife?--Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bailie Middleburgh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want!\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, in a sulky tone--\xe2\x80\x9cI want my bairn, or I\r\nwant naething frae nane o\xc3\xad ye, for as grand\xc3\xads ye are.\xe2\x80\x9d And she went on\r\nmuttering to herself with the wayward spitefulness of age--\xe2\x80\x9cThey maun hae\r\nlordships and honours, nae doubt--set them up, the gutter-bloods! and\r\ndeil a gentleman amang them.\xe2\x80\x9d--Then again addressing the sitting\r\nmagistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cWill _your honour_ gie me back my puir crazy bairn?--_His_\r\nhonour!--I hae kend the day when less wad ser\xc3\xadd him, the oe of a Campvere\r\nskipper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate to this shrewish supplicant--\xe2\x80\x9ctell us\r\nwhat it is you want, and do not interrupt the court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads as muckle as till say, Bark, Bawtie, and be dune wi\xc3\xadt!--I tell\r\nye,\xe2\x80\x9d raising her termagant voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI want my bairn! is na that braid\r\nScots?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho _are_ you?--who is your bairn?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWha am I?--wha suld I be, but Meg Murdockson, and wha suld my bairn be\r\nbut Magdalen Murdockson?--Your guard soldiers, and your constables, and\r\nyour officers, ken us weel eneugh when they rive the bits o\xc3\xad duds aff our\r\nbacks, and take what penny o\xc3\xad siller we hae, and harle us to the\r\nCorrectionhouse in Leith Wynd, and pettle us up wi\xc3\xad bread and water and\r\nsiclike sunkets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, looking round to some of his people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther than a gude ane, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the city officers, shrugging\r\nhis shoulders and smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill ye say sae?\xe2\x80\x9d said the termagant, her eye gleaming with impotent\r\nfury; \xe2\x80\x9can I had ye amang the Figgat-Whins,* wadna I set my ten talents in\r\nyour wuzzent face for that very word?\xe2\x80\x9d and she suited the word to the\r\naction, by spreading out a set of claws resembling those of St. George\xc3\xads\r\ndragon on a country sign-post.\r\n\r\n* [This was a name given to a tract of sand hillocks extending along the\r\nsea-shore from Leith to Portobello, and which at this time were covered\r\nwith _whin_-bushes or furze.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she want here?\xe2\x80\x9d said the impatient magistrate--\xe2\x80\x9cCan she not\r\ntell her business, or go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads my bairn!--it\xc3\xads Magdalen Murdockson I\xc3\xadm wantin\xc3\xad,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nbeldam, screaming at the highest pitch of her cracked and mistuned\r\nvoice--\xe2\x80\x9chavena I been telling ye sae this half-hour? And if ye are deaf,\r\nwhat needs ye sit cockit up there, and keep folk scraughin\xc3\xad t\xc3\xadye this\r\ngate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants her daughter, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the same officer whose interference\r\nhad given the hag such offence before--\xe2\x80\x9cher daughter, who was taken up\r\nlast night--Madge Wildfire, as they ca\xc3\xad her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadge Hellfire, as they ca\xc3\xad her!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the beldam \xe2\x80\x9cand what business\r\nhas a blackguard like you to ca\xc3\xad an honest woman\xc3\xads bairn out o\xc3\xad her ain\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn _honest_ woman\xc3\xads bairn, Maggie?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the peace-officer, smiling\r\nand shaking his head with an ironical emphasis on the adjective, and a\r\ncalmness calculated to provoke to madness the furious old shrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am no honest now, I was honest ance,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xc3\xads mair\r\nthan ye can say, ye born and bred thief, that never kend ither folks\xc3\xad\r\ngear frae your ain since the day ye was cleckit. Honest, say ye?--ye\r\npykit your mother\xc3\xads pouch o\xc3\xad twalpennies Scots when ye were five years\r\nauld, just as she was taking leave o\xc3\xad your father at the fit o\xc3\xad the\r\ngallows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has you there, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said the assistants, and there was a general\r\nlaugh; for the wit was fitted for the meridian of the place where it was\r\nuttered. This general applause somewhat gratified the passions of the old\r\nhag; the \xe2\x80\x9cgrim feature\xe2\x80\x9d smiled and even laughed--but it was a laugh of\r\nbitter scorn. She condescended, however, as if appeased by the success of\r\nher sally, to explain her business more distinctly, when the magistrate,\r\ncommanding silence, again desired her either to speak out her errand, or\r\nto leave the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer bairn,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9c_was_ her bairn, and she came to fetch her out of\r\nill haft and waur guiding. If she wasna sae wise as ither folk, few ither\r\nfolk had suffered as muckle as she had done; forby that she could fend\r\nthe waur for hersell within the four wa\xc3\xads of a jail. She could prove by\r\nfifty witnesses, and fifty to that, that her daughter had never seen Jock\r\nPorteous, alive or dead, since he had gien her a laundering wi\xc3\xad his cane,\r\nthe neger that he was! for driving a dead cat at the provost\xc3\xads wig on the\r\nElector of Hanover\xc3\xads birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the wretched appearance and violent demeanour of this\r\nwoman, the magistrate felt the justice of her argument, that her child\r\nmight be as dear to her as to a more fortunate and more amiable mother.\r\nHe proceeded to investigate the circumstances which had led to Madge\r\nMurdockson\xc3\xads (or Wildfire\xc3\xads) arrest, and as it was clearly shown that she\r\nhad not been engaged in the riot, he contented himself with directing\r\nthat an eye should be kept upon her by the police, but that for the\r\npresent she should be allowed to return home with her mother. During the\r\ninterval of fetching Madge from the jail, the magistrate endeavoured to\r\ndiscover whether her mother had been privy to the change of dress betwixt\r\nthat young woman and Robertson. But on this point he could obtain no\r\nlight. She persisted in declaring, that she had never seen Robertson\r\nsince his remarkable escape during service-time; and that, if her\r\ndaughter had changed clothes with him, it must have been during her\r\nabsence at a hamlet about two miles out of town, called Duddingstone,\r\nwhere she could prove that she passed that eventful night. And, in fact,\r\none of the town-officers, who had been searching for stolen linen at the\r\ncottage of a washer-woman in that village, gave his evidence, that he had\r\nseen Maggie Murdockson there, whose presence had considerably increased\r\nhis suspicion of the house in which she was a visitor, in respect that he\r\nconsidered her as a person of no good reputation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tauld ye sae,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hag; \xe2\x80\x9csee now what it is to hae a character,\r\ngude or bad!--Now, maybe, after a\xc3\xad, I could tell ye something about\r\nPorteous that you council-chamber bodies never could find out, for as\r\nmuckle stir as ye mak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned towards her--all ears were alert. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak out!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be for your ain gude,\xe2\x80\x9d insinuated the town-clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinna keep the Bailie waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d urged the assistants.\r\n\r\nShe remained doggedly silent for two or three minutes, casting around a\r\nmalignant and sulky glance, that seemed to enjoy the anxious suspense\r\nwith which they waited her answer. And then she broke forth at once,--\xe2\x80\x9cA\xc3\xad\r\nthat I ken about him is, that he was neither soldier nor gentleman, but\r\njust a thief and a blackguard, like maist o\xc3\xad yoursells, dears--What will\r\nye gie me for that news, now?--He wad hae served the gude town lang or\r\nprovost or bailie wad hae fund that out, my jo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile these matters were in discussion, Madge Wildfire entered, and her\r\nfirst exclamation was, \xe2\x80\x9cEh! see if there isna our auld ne\xc3\xader-do-weel\r\ndeevil\xc3\xads-buckie o\xc3\xad a mither--Hegh, sirs! but we are a hopeful family, to\r\nbe twa o\xc3\xad us in the Guard at ance--But there were better days wi\xc3\xad us\r\nance--were there na, mither?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Maggie\xc3\xads eyes had glistened with something like an expression of\r\npleasure when she saw her daughter set at liberty. But either her natural\r\naffection, like that of the tigress, could not be displayed without a\r\nstrain of ferocity, or there was something in the ideas which Madge\xc3\xads\r\nspeech awakened, that again stirred her cross and savage temper. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nsignifies what we, were, ye street-raking limmer!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, pushing\r\nher daughter before her to the door, with no gentle degree of violence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadse tell thee what thou is now--thou\xc3\xads a crazed hellicat Bess o\xc3\xad\r\nBedlam, that sall taste naething but bread and water for a fortnight, to\r\nserve ye for the plague ye hae gien me--and ower gude for ye, ye idle\r\ntaupie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadge, however, escaped from her mother at the door, ran back to the foot\r\nof the table, dropped a very low and fantastic courtesy to the judge, and\r\nsaid, with a giggling laugh,--\xe2\x80\x9cOur minnie\xc3\xads sair mis-set, after her\r\nordinar, sir--She\xc3\xadll hae had some quarrel wi\xc3\xad her auld gudeman--that\xc3\xads\r\nSatan, ye ken, sirs.\xe2\x80\x9d This explanatory note she gave in a low\r\nconfidential tone, and the spectators of that credulous generation did\r\nnot hear it without an involuntary shudder. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gudeman and her disna\r\naye gree weel, and then I maun pay the piper; but my back\xc3\xads broad eneugh\r\nto bear\xc3\xadt a\xc3\xad--an\xc3\xad if she hae nae havings, that\xc3\xads nae reason why wiser\r\nfolk shouldna hae some.\xe2\x80\x9d Here another deep courtesy, when the ungracious\r\nvoice of her mother was heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadge, ye limmer! If I come to fetch ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear till her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xc3\xadll wun out a gliff the night for a\xc3\xad\r\nthat, to dance in the moonlight, when her and the gudeman will be\r\nwhirrying through the blue lift on a broom-shank, to see Jean Jap, that\r\nthey hae putten intill the Kirkcaldy Tolbooth--ay, they will hae a merry\r\nsail ower Inchkeith, and ower a\xc3\xad the bits o\xc3\xad bonny waves that are\r\npoppling and plashing against the rocks in the gowden glimmer o\xc3\xad the\r\nmoon, ye ken.--I\xc3\xadm coming, mother--I\xc3\xadm coming,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, on hearing\r\na scuffle at the door betwixt the beldam and the officers, who were\r\nendeavouring to prevent her re-entrance. Madge then waved her hand wildly\r\ntowards the ceiling, and sung, at the topmost pitch of her voice,\r\n\r\n                                   \xe2\x80\x9cUp in the air,\r\n                        On my bonny grey mare,\r\n                        And I see, and I see, and I see her yet;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nand with a hop, skip, and jump, sprung out of the room, as the witches of\r\nMacbeth used, in less refined days, to seem to fly upwards from the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nSome weeks intervened before Mr. Middleburgh, agreeably to his benevolent\r\nresolution, found an opportunity of taking a walk towards St. Leonard\xc3\xads,\r\nin order to discover whether it might be possible to obtain the evidence\r\nhinted at in the anonymous letter respecting Effie Deans.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the anxious perquisitions made to discover the murderers of\r\nPorteous occupied the attention of all concerned with the administration\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these inquiries, two circumstances happened material to\r\nour story. Butler, after a close investigation of his conduct, was\r\ndeclared innocent of accession to the death of Porteous; but, as having\r\nbeen present during the whole transaction, was obliged to find bail not\r\nto quit his usual residence at Liberton, that he might appear as a\r\nwitness when called upon. The other incident regarded the disappearance\r\nof Madge Wildfire and her mother from Edinburgh. When they were sought,\r\nwith the purpose of subjecting them to some farther interrogatories, it\r\nwas discovered by Mr. Sharpitlaw that they had eluded the observation of\r\nthe police, and left the city so soon as dismissed from the\r\ncouncil-chamber. No efforts could trace the place of their retreat.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the excessive indignation of the Council of Regency, at\r\nthe slight put upon their authority by the murder of Porteous, had\r\ndictated measures, in which their own extreme desire of detecting the\r\nactors in that conspiracy were consulted in preference to the temper of\r\nthe people and the character of their churchmen. An act of Parliament was\r\nhastily passed, offering two hundred pounds reward to those who should\r\ninform against any person concerned in the deed, and the penalty of\r\ndeath, by a very unusual and severe enactment, was denounced against\r\nthose who should harbour the guilty. But what was chiefly accounted\r\nexceptionable, was a clause, appointing the act to be read in churches by\r\nthe officiating clergyman, on the first Sunday of every month, for a\r\ncertain period, immediately before the sermon. The ministers who should\r\nrefuse to comply with this injunction were declared, for the first\r\noffence, incapable of sitting or voting in any church judicature, and for\r\nthe second, incapable of holding any ecclesiastical preferment in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThis last order united in a common cause those who might privately\r\nrejoice in Porteous\xc3\xads death, though they dared not vindicate the manner\r\nof it, with the more scrupulous Presbyterians, who held that even the\r\npronouncing the name of the \xe2\x80\x9cLords Spiritual\xe2\x80\x9d in a Scottish pulpit was,\r\n_quodammodo,_ an acknowledgment of prelacy, and that the injunction of\r\nthe legislature was an interference of the civil government with the _jus\r\ndivinum_ of Presbytery, since to the General Assembly alone, as\r\nrepresenting the invisible head of the kirk, belonged the sole and\r\nexclusive right of regulating whatever pertained to public worship. Very\r\nmany also, of different political or religious sentiments, and therefore\r\nnot much moved by these considerations, thought they saw, in so violent\r\nan act of parliament, a more vindictive spirit than became the\r\nlegislature of a great country, and something like an attempt to trample\r\nupon the rights and independence of Scotland. The various steps adopted\r\nfor punishing the city of Edinburgh, by taking away her charter and\r\nliberties, for what a violent and overmastering mob had done within her\r\nwalls, were resented by many, who thought a pretext was too hastily taken\r\nfor degrading the ancient metropolis of Scotland. In short, there was\r\nmuch heart-burning, discontent, and disaffection, occasioned by these\r\nill-considered measures.*\r\n\r\n* The magistrates were closely interrogated before the House of Peers,\r\nconcerning the particulars of the Porteous Mob, and the _patois_ in which\r\nthese functionaries made their answers, sounded strange in the ears of\r\nthe  Southern nobles. The Duke of Newcastle having demanded to know with\r\nwhat kind of shot the guard which Porteous commanded had loaded their\r\nmuskets, was answered, naively, \xe2\x80\x9cOw, just sic as ane shoots _dukes and\r\nfools_ with.\xe2\x80\x9d This reply was considered as a contempt of the House of\r\nLords, and the Provost would have suffered accordingly, but that the Duke\r\nof Argyle explained, that the expression, properly rendered into English,\r\nmeant _ducks and waterfowls._\r\n\r\n Amidst these heats and dissensions, the trial of Effie Deans, after she\r\nhad been many weeks imprisoned, was at length about to be brought\r\nforward, and Mr. Middleburgh found leisure to inquire into the evidence\r\nconcerning her. For this purpose, he chose a fine day for his walk\r\ntowards her father\xc3\xads house.\r\n\r\nThe excursion into the country was somewhat distant, in the opinion of a\r\nburgess of those days, although many of the present inhabit suburban\r\nvillas considerably beyond the spot to which we allude. Three-quarters of\r\nan hour\xc3\xads walk, however, even at a pace of magisterial gravity, conducted\r\nour benevolent office-bearer to the Crags of St. Leonard\xc3\xads, and the\r\nhumble mansion of David Deans.\r\n\r\nThe old man was seated on the deas, or turf-seat, at the end of his\r\ncottage, busied in mending his cart-harness with his own hands; for in\r\nthose days any sort of labour which required a little more skill than\r\nusual fell to the share of the goodman himself, and that even when he was\r\nwell to pass in the world. With stern and austere gravity he persevered\r\nin his task, after having just raised his head to notice the advance of\r\nthe stranger. It would have been impossible to have discovered, from his\r\ncountenance and manner, the internal feelings of agony with which he\r\ncontended. Mr. Middleburgh waited an instant, expecting Deans would in\r\nsome measure acknowledge his presence, and lead into conversation; but,\r\nas he seemed determined to remain silent, he was himself obliged to speak\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Middleburgh--Mr. James Middleburgh, one of the present\r\nmagistrates of the city of Edinburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be sae,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Deans laconically, and without interrupting his\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the duty of a magistrate is\r\nsometimes an unpleasant one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be sae,\xe2\x80\x9d replied David; \xe2\x80\x9cI hae naething to say in the contrair;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and he was again doggedly silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be aware,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cthat persons in my\r\nsituation are often obliged to make painful and disagreeable inquiries of\r\nindividuals, merely because it is their bounden duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be sae,\xe2\x80\x9d again replied Deans; \xe2\x80\x9cI hae naething to say anent it,\r\neither the tae way or the t\xc3\xadother. But I do ken there was ance in a day a\r\njust and God-fearing magistracy in yon town o\xc3\xad Edinburgh, that did not\r\nbear the sword in vain, but were a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to\r\nsuch as kept the path. In the glorious days of auld worthy faithfu\xc3\xad\r\nProvost Dick,* when there was a true and faithfu\xc3\xad General Assembly of\r\n\r\n* Note M. Sir William Dick of Braid.\r\n\r\nthe Kirk, walking hand in hand with the real noble Scottish-hearted\r\nbarons, and with the magistrates of this and other towns, gentles,\r\nburgesses, and commons of all ranks, seeing with one eye, hearing with\r\none ear, and upholding the ark with their united strength--And then folk\r\nmight see men deliver up their silver to the state\xc3\xads use, as if it had\r\nbeen as muckle sclate stanes. My father saw them toom the sacks of\r\ndollars out o\xc3\xad Provost Dick\xc3\xads window intill the carts that carried them\r\nto the army at Dunse Law; and if ye winna believe his testimony, there is\r\nthe window itsell still standing in the Luckenbooths--I think it\xc3\xads a\r\nclaith-merchant\xc3\xads booth the day*--at the airn stanchells, five doors\r\nabune Gossford\xc3\xads Close.\r\n\r\n* I think so too--But if the reader be curious, he may consult Mr.\r\nChambers\xc3\xads Traditions of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n--But now we haena sic spirit amang us; we think mair about the warst\r\nwallydraigle in our ain byre, than about the blessing which the angel of\r\nthe covenant gave to the Patriarch even at Peniel and Mahanaim, or the\r\nbinding obligation of our national vows; and we wad rather gie a pund\r\nScots to buy an unguent to clear out auld rannell-trees and our beds o\xc3\xad\r\nthe English bugs as they ca\xc3\xad them, than we wad gie a plack to rid the\r\nland of the swarm of Arminian caterpillars, Socinian pismires, and\r\ndeistical Miss Katies, that have ascended out of the bottomless pit, to\r\nplague this perverse, insidious, and lukewarm generation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt happened to Davie Deans on this occasion, as it has done to many other\r\nhabitual orators; when once he became embarked on his favourite subject,\r\nthe stream of his own enthusiasm carried him forward in spite of his\r\nmental distress, while his well-exercised memory supplied him amply with\r\nall the types and tropes of rhetoric peculiar to his sect and cause.\r\n\r\nMr. Middleburgh contented himself with answering--\xe2\x80\x9cAll this may be very\r\ntrue, my friend; but, as you said just now, I have nothing to say to it\r\nat present, either one way or other.--You have two daughters, I think,\r\nMr. Deans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man winced, as one whose smarting sore is suddenly galled; but\r\ninstantly composed himself, resumed the work which, in the heat of his\r\ndeclamation, he had laid down, and answered with sullen resolution, \xe2\x80\x9cAe\r\ndaughter, sir--only _ane._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Middleburgh; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have only one daughter\r\nhere at home with you--but this unfortunate girl who is a prisoner--she\r\nis, I think, your youngest daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian sternly raised his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the world, and according\r\nto the flesh, she _is_ my daughter; but when she became a child of\r\nBelial, and a company-keeper, and a trader in guilt and iniquity, she\r\nceased to be a bairn of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, Mr. Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d said Middleburgh, sitting down by him, and\r\nendeavouring to take his hand, which the old man proudly withdrew, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nare ourselves all sinners; and the errors of our offspring, as they ought\r\nnot to surprise us, being the portion which they derive of a common\r\nportion of corruption inherited through us, so they do not entitle us to\r\ncast them off because they have lost themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Deans impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cI ken a\xc3\xad that as weel as--I mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he resumed, checking the irritation he felt at being schooled--a\r\ndiscipline of the mind which those most ready to bestow it on others do\r\nthemselves most reluctantly submit to receive--\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say, that what\r\nye o serve may be just and reasonable--But I hae nae freedom to enter\r\ninto my ain private affairs wi\xc3\xad strangers--And now, in this great\r\nnational emergency, When there\xc3\xads the Porteous\xc3\xad Act has come doun frae\r\nLondon, that is a deeper blow to this poor sinfu\xc3\xad kingdom and suffering\r\nkirk than ony that has been heard of since the foul and fatal Test--at a\r\ntime like this--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, goodman,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr. Middleburgh, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must think of your own\r\nhousehold first, or else you are worse even than the infidels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell ye, Bailie Middleburgh,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted David Deans, \xe2\x80\x9cif ye be a\r\nbailie, as there is little honour in being ane in these evil days--I tell\r\nye, I heard the gracious Saunders Peden--I wotna whan it was; but it was\r\nin killing time, when the plowers were drawing alang their furrows on the\r\nback of the Kirk of Scotland--I heard him tell his hearers, gude and\r\nwaled Christians they were too, that some o\xc3\xad them wad greet mair for a\r\nbit drowned calf or stirk than for a\xc3\xad the defections and oppressions of\r\nthe day; and that they were some o\xc3\xad them thinking o\xc3\xad ae thing, some o\xc3\xad\r\nanither, and there was Lady Hundleslope thinking o\xc3\xad greeting Jock at the\r\nfireside! And the lady confessed in my hearing that a drow of anxiety had\r\ncome ower her for her son that she had left at hame weak of a decay*--And\r\nwhat wad he hae said of me if I had ceased to think of the gude cause for\r\na castaway--a--It kills me to think of what she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* See _Life of Peden,_ p. 14.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the life of your child, goodman--think of that--if her life could be\r\nsaved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Middleburgh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer life!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed David--\xe2\x80\x9cI wadna gie ane o\xc3\xad my grey hairs for her\r\nlife, if her gude name be gane--And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, relenting and\r\nretracting as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cI wad make the niffer, Mr. Middleburgh--I wad\r\ngie a\xc3\xad these grey hairs that she has brought to shame and sorrow--I wad\r\ngie the auld head they grow on for her life, and that she might hae time\r\nto amend and return, for what hae the wicked beyond the breath of their\r\nnosthrils?--but I\xc3\xadll never see her mair--No!--that--that I am determined\r\nin--I\xc3\xadll never see her mair!\xe2\x80\x9d His lips continued to move for a minute\r\nafter his voice ceased to be heard, as if he were repeating the same vow\r\ninternally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Middleburgh, \xe2\x80\x9cI speak to you as a man of sense; if\r\nyou would save your daughter\xc3\xads life, you must use human means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand what you mean; but Mr. Novit, who is the procurator and\r\ndoer of an honourable person, the Laird of Dumbiedikes, is to do what\r\ncarnal wisdom can do for her in the circumstances. Mysell am not clear to\r\ntrinquet and traffic wi\xc3\xad courts o\xc3\xad justice as they are now constituted; I\r\nhave a tenderness and scruple in my mind anent them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Middleburgh, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are a Cameronian, and do\r\nnot acknowledge the authority of our courts of judicature, or present\r\ngovernment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, under your favour,\xe2\x80\x9d replied David, who was too proud of his own\r\npolemical knowledge to call himself the follower of any one, \xe2\x80\x9cye take me\r\nup before I fall down. I canna see why I suld be termed a Cameronian,\r\nespecially now that ye hae given the name of that famous and savoury\r\nsufferer, not only until a regimental band of souldiers, [H. M. 26th\r\nFoot] whereof I am told many can now curse, swear, and use profane\r\nlanguage, as fast as ever Richard Cameron could preach or pray, but also\r\nbecause ye have, in as far as it is in your power, rendered that martyr\xc3\xads\r\nname vain and contemptible, by pipes, drums, and fifes, playing the vain\r\ncarnal spring called the Cameronian Rant, which too many professors of\r\nreligion dance to--a practice maist unbecoming a professor to dance to\r\nany tune whatsoever, more especially promiscuously, that is, with the\r\nfemale sex.* A brutish fashion it is, whilk is the beginning of defection\r\nwith many, as I may hae as muckle cause as maist folk to testify.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* See Note F. Peter Walker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but, Mr. Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Middleburgh, \xe2\x80\x9cI only meant to say\r\nthat you were a Cameronian, or MacMillanite, one of the society people,\r\nin short, who think it inconsistent to take oaths under a government\r\nwhere the Covenant is not ratified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the controversialist, who forgot even his present distress\r\nin such discussions as these, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot fickle me sae easily as you do\r\nopine. I am _not_ a MacMillanite, or a Russelite, or a Hamiltonian, or a\r\nHarleyite, or a Howdenite*--I will be led by the nose by none--I take my\r\nname as a Christian from no vessel of clay. I have my own principles and\r\npractice to answer for, and am an humble pleader for the gude auld cause\r\nin a legal way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* All various species of the great genus Cameronian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, Mr. Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d said Middleburgh, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are a _Deanite,_\r\nand have opinions peculiar to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may please you to say sae,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Deans; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have maintained\r\nmy testimony before as great folk, and in sharper times; and though I\r\nwill neither exalt myself nor pull down others, I wish every man and\r\nwoman in this land had kept the true testimony, and the middle and\r\nstraight path, as it were, on the ridge of a hill, where wind and water\r\nshears, avoiding right-hand snares and extremes, and left-hand\r\nway-slidings, as weel as Johnny Dodds of Farthing\xc3\xads Acre, and ae man mair\r\nthat shall be nameless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the magistrate, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is as much as to say, that\r\nJohnny Dodds of Farthing\xc3\xads Acre, and David Deans of St. Leonard\xc3\xads,\r\nconstitute the only members of the true, real, unsophisticated Kirk of\r\nScotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid that I suld make sic a vain-glorious speech, when there are\r\nsae mony professing Christians!\xe2\x80\x9d answered David; \xe2\x80\x9cbut this I maun say,\r\nthat all men act according to their gifts and their grace, \xc3\xabsae that it\r\nis nae marvel that--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very fine,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr. Middleburgh; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have no time\r\nto spend in hearing it. The matter in hand is this--I have directed a\r\ncitation to be lodged in your daughter\xc3\xads hands--If she appears on the day\r\nof trial and gives evidence, there is reason to hope she may save her\r\nsister\xc3\xads life--if, from any constrained scruples about the legality of\r\nher performing the office of an affectionate sister and a good subject,\r\nby appearing in a court held under the authority of the law and\r\ngovernment, you become the means of deterring her from the discharge of\r\nthis duty, I must say, though the truth may sound harsh in your ears,\r\nthat you, who gave life to this unhappy girl, will become the means of\r\nher losing it by a premature and violent death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, Mr. Middleburgh turned to leave him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBide awee--bide awee, Mr. Middleburgh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Deans, in great perplexity\r\nand distress of mind; but the Bailie, who was probably sensible that\r\nprotracted discussion might diminish the effect of his best and most\r\nforcible argument, took a hasty leave, and declined entering farther into\r\nthe controversy.\r\n\r\nDeans sunk down upon his seat, stunned with a variety of conflicting\r\nemotions. It had been a great source of controversy among those holding\r\nhis opinions in religious matters how far the government which succeeded\r\nthe Revolution could be, without sin, acknowledged by true Presbyterians,\r\nseeing that it did not recognise the great national testimony of the\r\nSolemn League and Covenant? And latterly, those agreeing in this general\r\ndoctrine, and assuming the sounding title of \xe2\x80\x9cThe anti-Popish,\r\nanti-Prelatic, anti-Erastian, anti-Sectarian, true Presbyterian remnant,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n were divided into many petty sects among themselves, even as to the\r\nextent of submission to the existing laws and rulers, which constituted\r\nsuch an acknowledgment as amounted to sin.\r\n\r\nAt a very stormy and tumultuous meeting, held in 1682, to discuss these\r\nimportant and delicate points, the testimonies of the faithful few were\r\nfound utterly inconsistent with each other.*\r\n\r\n* This remarkable convocation took place upon 15th June 1682, and an\r\naccount of its confused and divisive proceedings may be found in Michael\r\nShield\xc3\xads _Faithful Contendings Displayed_ (first printed at Glasgow,\r\n1780,  p. 21). It affords a singular and melancholy example how much a\r\nmetaphysical  and polemical spirit had crept in amongst these unhappy\r\nsufferers, since amid so many real injuries which they had to sustain,\r\nthey were disposed to add disagreement and disunion concerning the\r\ncharacter and extent of such as were only imaginary.\r\n\r\nThe place where this conference took place was remarkably well adapted\r\nfor such an assembly. It was a wild and very sequestered dell in\r\nTweeddale, surrounded by high hills, and far remote from human\r\nhabitation. A small river, or rather a mountain torrent, called the\r\nTalla, breaks down the glen with great fury, dashing successively over a\r\nnumber of small cascades, which has procured the spot the name of Talla\r\nLinns. Here the leaders among the scattered adherents to the Covenant,\r\nmen who, in their banishment from human society, and in the recollection\r\nof the seventies to which they had been exposed, had become at once\r\nsullen in their tempers, and fantastic in their religious opinions, met\r\nwith arms in their hands, and by the side of the torrent discussed, with\r\na turbulence which the noise of the stream could not drown, points of\r\ncontroversy as empty and unsubstantial as its foam.\r\n\r\nIt was the fixed judgment of most of the meeting, that all payment of\r\ncess or tribute to the existing government was utterly unlawful, and a\r\nsacrificing to idols. About other impositions and degrees of submission\r\nthere were various opinions; and perhaps it is the best illustration of\r\nthe spirit of those military fathers of the church to say, that while all\r\nallowed it was impious to pay the cess employed for maintaining the\r\nstanding army and militia, there was a fierce controversy on the\r\nlawfulness of paying the duties levied at ports and bridges, for\r\nmaintaining roads and other necessary purposes; that there were some who,\r\nrepugnant to these imposts for turnpikes and pontages, were nevertheless\r\nfree in conscience to make payment of the usual freight at public\r\nferries, and that a person of exceeding and punctilious zeal, James\r\nRussel, one of the slayers of the Archbishop of St. Andrews, had given\r\nhis testimony with great warmth even against this last faint shade of\r\nsubjection to constituted authority. This ardent and enlightened person\r\nand his followers had also great scruples about the lawfulness of\r\nbestowing the ordinary names upon the days of the week and the months of\r\nthe year, which savoured in their nostrils so strongly of paganism, that\r\nat length they arrived at the conclusion that they who owned such names\r\nas Monday, Tuesday, January, February, and so forth, \xe2\x80\x9cserved themselves\r\nheirs to the same, if not greater punishment, than had been denounced\r\nagainst the idolaters of old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid Deans had been present on this memorable occasion, although too\r\nyoung to be a speaker among the polemical combatants. His brain, however,\r\nhad been thoroughly heated by the noise, clamour, and metaphysical\r\ningenuity of the discussion, and it was a controversy to which his mind\r\nhad often returned; and though he carefully disguised his vacillation\r\nfrom others, and, perhaps from himself, he had never been able to come to\r\nany precise line of decision on the subject. In fact, his natural sense\r\nhad acted as a counterpoise to his controversial zeal. He was by no means\r\npleased with the quiet and indifferent manner in which King William\xc3\xads\r\ngovernment slurred over the errors of the times, when, far from restoring\r\nthe Presbyterian kirk to its former supremacy, they passed an act of\r\noblivion even to those who had been its persecutors, and bestowed on many\r\nof them titles, favours, and employments. When, in the first General\r\nAssembly which succeeded the Revolution, an overture was made for the\r\nrevival of the League and Covenant, it was with horror that Douce David\r\nheard the proposal eluded by the men of carnal wit and policy, as he\r\ncalled them, as being inapplicable to the present times, and not falling\r\nunder the modern model of the church. The reign of Queen Anne had\r\nincreased his conviction, that the Revolution government was not one of\r\nthe true Presbyterian complexion. But then, more sensible than the bigots\r\nof his sect, he did not confound the moderation and tolerance of these\r\ntwo reigns with the active tyranny and oppression exercised in those of\r\nCharles II. and James II. The Presbyterian form of religion, though\r\ndeprived of the weight formerly attached to its sentences of\r\nexcommunication, and compelled to tolerate the coexistence of Episcopacy,\r\nand of sects of various descriptions, was still the National Church; and\r\nthough the glory of the second temple was far inferior to that which had\r\nflourished from 1639 till the battle of Dunbar, still it was a structure\r\nthat, wanting the strength and the terrors, retained at least the form\r\nand symmetry, of the original model. Then came the insurrection in 1715,\r\nand David Deans\xc3\xads horror for the revival of the Popish and prelatical\r\nfaction reconciled him greatly to the government of King George, although\r\nhe grieved that that monarch might be suspected of a leaning unto\r\nErastianism. In short, moved by so many different considerations, he had\r\nshifted his ground at different times concerning the degree of freedom\r\nwhich he felt in adopting any act of immediate acknowledgment or\r\nsubmission to the present government, which, however mild and paternal,\r\nwas still uncovenanted, and now he felt himself called upon, by the most\r\npowerful motive conceivable, to authorise his daughter\xc3\xads giving testimony\r\nin a court of justice, which all who have been since called Cameronians\r\naccounted a step of lamentable and direct defection. The voice of nature,\r\nhowever, exclaimed loud in his bosom against the dictates of fanaticism;\r\nand his imagination, fertile in the solution of polemical difficulties,\r\ndevised an expedient for extricating himself from the fearful dilemma, in\r\nwhich he saw, on the one side, a falling off from principle, and, on the\r\nother, a scene from which a father\xc3\xads thoughts could not but turn in\r\nshuddering horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been constant and unchanged in my testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Deans;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut then who has said it of me, that I have judged my neighbour over\r\nclosely, because he hath had more freedom in his walk than I have found\r\nin mine? I never was a separatist, nor for quarrelling with tender souls\r\nabout mint, cummin, or other the lesser tithes. My daughter Jean may have\r\na light in this subject that is hid frae my auld een--it is laid on her\r\nconscience, and not on mine--If she hath freedom to gang before this\r\njudicatory, and hold up her hand for this poor castaway, surely I will\r\nnot say she steppeth over her bounds; and if not\xe2\x80\x9d--He paused in his\r\nmental argument, while a pang of unutterable anguish convulsed his\r\nfeatures, yet, shaking it off, he firmly resumed the strain of his\r\nreasoning--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if not--God forbid that she should go into defection at\r\nbidding of mine! I wunna fret the tender conscience of one bairn--no, not\r\nto save the life of the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA Roman would have devoted his daughter to death from different feelings\r\nand motives, but not upon a more heroic principle of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   To man, in this his trial state,\r\n                        The privilege is given,\r\n                   When tost by tides of human fate,\r\n                        To anchor fast on heaven.\r\n                                        Watts\xc3\xads _Hymns._\r\n\r\nIt was with a firm step that Deans sought his daughter\xc3\xads apartment,\r\ndetermined to leave her to the light of her own conscience in the dubious\r\npoint of casuistry in which he supposed her to be placed.\r\n\r\nThe little room had been the sleeping apartment of both sisters, and\r\nthere still stood there a small occasional bed which had been made for\r\nEffie\xc3\xads accommodation, when, complaining of illness, she had declined to\r\nshare, as in happier times, her sister\xc3\xads pillow. The eyes of Deans rested\r\ninvoluntarily, on entering the room, upon this little couch, with its\r\ndark-green coarse curtains, and the ideas connected with it rose so thick\r\nupon his soul as almost to incapacitate him from opening his errand to\r\nhis daughter. Her occupation broke the ice. He found her gazing on a slip\r\nof paper, which contained a citation to her to appear as a witness upon\r\nher sister\xc3\xads trial in behalf of the accused. For the worthy magistrate,\r\ndetermined to omit no chance of doing Effie justice, and to leave her\r\nsister no apology for not giving the evidence which she was supposed to\r\npossess, had caused the ordinary citation, or _subpoena,_ of the Scottish\r\ncriminal court, to be served upon her by an officer during his conference\r\nwith David.\r\n\r\nThis precaution was so far favourable to Deans, that it saved him the\r\npain of entering upon a formal explanation with his daughter; he only\r\nsaid, with a hollow and tremulous voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive ye are aware of the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO father, we are cruelly sted between God\xc3\xads laws and man\xc3\xads laws--What\r\nshall we do?--What can we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie, it must be observed, had no hesitation whatever about the mere\r\nact of appearing in a court of justice. She might have heard the point\r\ndiscussed by her father more than once; but we have already noticed that\r\nshe was accustomed to listen with reverence to much which she was\r\nincapable of understanding, and that subtle arguments of casuistry found\r\nher a patient, but unedified hearer. Upon receiving the citation,\r\ntherefore, her thoughts did not turn upon the chimerical scruples which\r\nalarmed her father\xc3\xads mind, but to the language which had been held to her\r\nby the stranger at Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn. In a word, she never doubted but she\r\nwas to be dragged forward into the court of justice, in order to place\r\nher in the cruel position of either sacrificing her sister by telling the\r\ntruth, or committing perjury in order to save her life. And so strongly\r\ndid her thoughts run in this channel, that she applied her father\xc3\xads\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cYe are aware of the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d to his acquaintance with the advice\r\nthat had been so fearfully enforced upon her. She looked up with anxious\r\nsurprise, not unmingled with a cast of horror, which his next words, as\r\nshe interpreted and applied them, were not qualified to remove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, \xe2\x80\x9cit has ever been my mind, that in things of ane\r\ndoubtful and controversial nature, ilk Christian\xc3\xads conscience suld be his\r\nain guide--Wherefore descend into yourself, try your ain mind with\r\nsufficiency of soul exercise, and as you sall finally find yourself clear\r\nto do in this matter--even so be it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, whose mind revolted at the construction which\r\nshe naturally put upon his language, \xe2\x80\x9ccan this-this be a doubtful or\r\ncontroversial matter?--Mind, father, the ninth command--\xc3\xabThou shalt not\r\nbear false witness against thy neighbour.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid Deans paused; for, still applying her speech to his preconceived\r\ndifficulties, it seemed to him as if _she,_ a woman, and a sister, was\r\nscarce entitled to be scrupulous upon this occasion, where he, a man,\r\nexercised in the testimonies of that testifying period, had given\r\nindirect countenance to her following what must have been the natural\r\ndictates of her own feelings. But he kept firm his purpose, until his\r\neyes involuntarily rested upon the little settle-bed, and recalled the\r\nform of the child of his old age, as she sate upon it, pale, emaciated,\r\nand broken-hearted. His mind, as the picture arose before him,\r\ninvoluntarily conceived, and his tongue involuntarily uttered--but in a\r\ntone how different from his usual dogmatical precision!--arguments for\r\nthe course of conduct likely to ensure his child\xc3\xads safety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaughter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not say that your path was free from\r\nstumbling--and, questionless, this act may be in the opinion of some a\r\ntransgression, since he who beareth witness unlawfully, and against his\r\nconscience, doth in some sort bear false witness against his neighbour.\r\nYet in matters of compliance, the guilt lieth not in the compliance sae\r\nmuckle, as in the mind and conscience of him that doth comply; and,\r\ntherefore, although my testimony hath not been spared upon public\r\ndefections, I haena felt freedom to separate mysell from the communion of\r\nmany who have been clear to hear those ministers who have taken the fatal\r\nindulgence because they might get good of them, though I could not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen David had proceeded thus far, his conscience reproved him, that he\r\nmight be indirectly undermining the purity of his daughter\xc3\xads faith, and\r\nsmoothing the way for her falling off from strictness of principle. He,\r\ntherefore, suddenly stopped, and changed his tone:--\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie, I perceive\r\nthat our vile affections,--so I call them in respect of doing the will of\r\nour Father,--cling too heavily to me in this hour of trying sorrow, to\r\npermit me to keep sight of my ain duty, or to airt you to yours. I will\r\nspeak nae mair anent this overtrying matter--Jeanie, if ye can, wi\xc3\xad God\r\nand gude conscience, speak in favour of this puir unhappy\xe2\x80\x9d--(here his\r\nvoice faltered)--\xe2\x80\x9cShe is your sister in the flesh--worthless and castaway\r\nas she is, she is the daughter of a saint in heaven, that was a mother to\r\nyou, Jeanie, in place of your ain--but if ye arena free in conscience to\r\nspeak for her in the court of judicature, follow your conscience, Jeanie,\r\nand let God\xc3\xads will be done.\xe2\x80\x9d After this adjuration he left the apartment,\r\nand his daughter remained in a state of great distress and perplexity.\r\n\r\nIt would have been no small addition to the sorrows of David Deans, even\r\nin this extremity of suffering, had he known that his daughter was\r\napplying the casuistical arguments which he had been using, not in the\r\nsense of a permission to follow her own opinion on a dubious and disputed\r\npoint of controversy, but rather as an encouragement to transgress one of\r\nthose divine commandments which Christians of all sects and denominations\r\nunite in holding most sacred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan this be?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, as the door closed on her father--\xe2\x80\x9cCan these\r\nbe his words that I have heard, or has the Enemy taken his voice and\r\nfeatures to give weight unto the counsel which causeth to perish?--a\r\nsister\xc3\xads life, and a father pointing out how to save it!--O God, deliver\r\nme!--this is a fearfu\xc3\xad temptation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoaming from thought to thought, she at one time imagined her father\r\nunderstood the ninth commandment literally, as prohibiting false witness\r\n_against_ our neighbour, without extending the denunciation against\r\nfalsehood uttered _in favour_ of the criminal. But her clear and\r\nunsophisticated power of discriminating between good and evil, instantly\r\nrejected an interpretation so limited, and so unworthy of the Author of\r\nthe law. She remained in a state of the most agitating terror and\r\nuncertainty--afraid to communicate her thoughts freely to her father,\r\nlest she should draw forth an opinion with which she could not\r\ncomply,--wrung with distress on her sister\xc3\xads account, rendered the more\r\nacute by reflecting that the means of saving her were in her power, but\r\nwere such as her conscience prohibited her from using,--tossed, in\r\nshort, like a vessel in an open roadstead during a storm, and, like that\r\nvessel, resting on one only sure cable and anchor,--faith in Providence,\r\nand a resolution to discharge her duty.\r\n\r\nButler\xc3\xads affection and strong sense of religion would have been her\r\nprincipal support in these distressing circumstances, but he was still\r\nunder restraint, which did not permit him to come to St. Leonard\xc3\xads Crags;\r\nand her distresses were of a nature, which, with her indifferent habits\r\nof scholarship, she found it impossible to express in writing. She was\r\ntherefore compelled to trust for guidance to her own unassisted sense of\r\nwhat was right or wrong. It was not the least of Jeanie\xc3\xads distresses,\r\nthat, although she hoped and believed her sister to be innocent, she had\r\nnot the means of receiving that assurance from her own mouth.\r\n\r\nThe double-dealing of Ratcliffe in the matter of Robertson had not\r\nprevented his being rewarded, as double-dealers frequently have been,\r\nwith favour and preferment. Sharpitlaw, who found in him something of a\r\nkindred genius, had been intercessor in his behalf with the magistrates,\r\nand the circumstance of his having voluntarily remained in the prison,\r\nwhen the doors were forced by the mob, would have made it a hard measure\r\nto take the life which he had such easy means of saving. He received a\r\nfull pardon; and soon afterwards, James Ratcliffe, the greatest thief and\r\nhousebreaker in Scotland, was, upon the faith, perhaps, of an ancient\r\nproverb, selected as a person to be entrusted with the custody of other\r\ndelinquents.\r\n\r\nWhen Ratcliffe was thus placed in a confidential situation, he was\r\nrepeatedly applied to by the sapient Saddletree and others, who took some\r\ninterest in the Deans family, to procure an interview between the\r\nsisters; but the magistrates, who were extremely anxious for the\r\napprehension of Robertson, had given strict orders to the contrary,\r\nhoping that, by keeping them separate, they might, from the one or the\r\nother, extract some information respecting that fugitive. On this subject\r\nJeanie had nothing to tell them. She informed Mr. Middleburgh, that she\r\nknew nothing of Robertson, except having met him that night by\r\nappointment to give her some advice respecting her sister\xc3\xads concern, the\r\npurport of which, she said, was betwixt God and her conscience. Of his\r\nmotions, purposes, or plans, past, present, or future, she knew nothing,\r\nand so had nothing to communicate.\r\n\r\nEffie was equally silent, though from a different cause. It was in vain\r\nthat they offered a commutation and alleviation of her punishment, and\r\neven a free pardon, if she would confess what she knew of her lover. She\r\nanswered only with tears; unless, when at times driven into pettish\r\nsulkiness by the persecution of the interrogators, she made them abrupt\r\nand disrespectful answers.\r\n\r\nAt length, after her trial had been delayed for many weeks, in hopes she\r\nmight be induced to speak out on a subject infinitely more interesting to\r\nthe magistracy than her own guilt or innocence, their patience was worn\r\nout, and even Mr. Middleburgh finding no ear lent to farther intercession\r\nin her behalf, the day was fixed for the trial to proceed.\r\n\r\nIt was now, and not sooner, that Sharpitlaw, recollecting his promise to\r\nEffie Deans, or rather being dinned into compliance by the unceasing\r\nremonstrances of Mrs. Saddletree, who was his next-door neighbour, and\r\nwho declared it was heathen cruelty to keep the twa brokenhearted\r\ncreatures separate, issued the important mandate, permitting them to see\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nOn the evening which preceded the eventful day of trial, Jeanie was\r\npermitted to see her sister--an awful interview, and occurring at a most\r\ndistressing crisis. This, however, formed a part of the bitter cup which\r\nshe was doomed to drink, to atone for crimes and follies to which she had\r\nno accession; and at twelve o\xc3\xadclock noon, being the time appointed for\r\nadmission to the jail, she went to meet, for the first time for several\r\nmonths, her guilty, erring, and most miserable sister, in that abode of\r\nguilt, error, and utter misery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Sweet sister, let me live!\r\n                What sin you do to save a brother\xc3\xads life,\r\n                Nature dispenses with the deed so far,\r\n                           That it becomes a virtue.\r\n                                        Measure for Measure.\r\n\r\nJeanie Deans was admitted into the jail by Ratcliffe. This fellow, as\r\nvoid of shame as of honesty, as he opened the now trebly secured door,\r\nasked her, with a leer which made her shudder, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether she remembered\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA half-pronounced and timid \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d was her answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! not remember moonlight, and Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn, and Rob and Rat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he, with the same sneer;--\xe2\x80\x9cYour memory needs redding up, my jo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Jeanie\xc3\xads distresses had admitted of aggravation, it must have been to\r\nfind her sister under the charge of such a profligate as this man. He was\r\nnot, indeed, without something of good to balance so much that was evil\r\nin his character and habits. In his misdemeanours he had never been\r\nbloodthirsty or cruel; and in his present occupation, he had shown\r\nhimself, in a certain degree, accessible to touches of humanity. But\r\nthese good qualities were unknown to Jeanie, who, remembering the scene\r\nat Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn, could scarce find voice to acquaint him, that she had\r\nan order from Bailie Middleburgh, permitting her to see her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ken that fa\xc3\xad weel, my bonny doo; mair by token, I have a special\r\ncharge to stay in the ward with you a\xc3\xad the time ye are thegither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust that be sae?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jeanie, with an imploring voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout, ay, hinny,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the turnkey; \xe2\x80\x9cand what the waur will you and\r\nyour tittie be of Jim Ratcliffe hearing what ye hae to say to ilk\r\nother?--Deil a word ye\xc3\xadll say that will gar him ken your kittle sex\r\nbetter than he kens them already; and another thing is, that if ye dinna\r\nspeak o\xc3\xad breaking the Tolbooth, deil a word will I tell ower, either to\r\ndo ye good or ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus saying, Ratcliffe marshalled her the way to the apartment where\r\nEffie was confined.\r\n\r\nShame, fear, and grief, had contended for mastery in the poor prisoner\xc3\xads\r\nbosom during the whole morning, while she had looked forward to this\r\nmeeting; but when the door opened, all gave way to a confused and strange\r\nfeeling that had a tinge of joy in it, as, throwing herself on her\r\nsister\xc3\xads neck, she ejaculated, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Jeanie!--my dear Jeanie! it\xc3\xads\r\nlang since I hae seen ye.\xe2\x80\x9d Jeanie returned the embrace with an\r\nearnestness that partook almost of rapture, but it was only a flitting\r\nemotion, like a sunbeam unexpectedly penetrating betwixt the clouds of a\r\ntempest, and obscured almost as soon as visible. The sisters walked\r\ntogether to the side of the pallet bed, and sate down side by side, took\r\nhold of each other\xc3\xads hands, and looked each other in the face, but\r\nwithout speaking a word. In this posture they remained for a minute,\r\nwhile the gleam of joy gradually faded from their features, and gave way\r\nto the most intense expression, first of melancholy, and then of agony,\r\ntill, throwing themselves again into each other\xc3\xads arms, they, to use the\r\nlanguage of Scripture, lifted up their voices, and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\nEven the hardhearted turnkey, who had spent his life in scenes calculated\r\nto stifle both conscience and feeling, could not witness this scene\r\nwithout a touch of human sympathy. It was shown in a trifling action, but\r\nwhich had more delicacy in it than seemed to belong to Ratcliffe\xc3\xads\r\ncharacter and station. The unglazed window of the miserable chamber was\r\nopen, and the beams of a bright sun fell right upon the bed where the\r\nsufferers were seated. With a gentleness that had something of reverence\r\nin it, Ratcliffe partly closed the shutter, and seemed thus to throw a\r\nveil over a scene so sorrowful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are ill, Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d were the first words Jeanie could utter; \xe2\x80\x9cye are\r\nvery ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, what wad I gie to be ten times waur, Jeanie!\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nwad I gie to be cauld dead afore the ten o\xc3\xadclock bell the morn! And our\r\nfather--but I am his bairn nae langer now--O, I hae nae friend left in\r\nthe warld!--O, that I were lying dead at my mother\xc3\xads side, in Newbattle\r\nkirkyard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout, lassie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, willing to show the interest which he\r\nabsolutely felt, \xe2\x80\x9cdinna be sae dooms doon-hearted as a\xc3\xad that; there\xc3\xads\r\nmony a tod hunted that\xc3\xads no killed. Advocate Langtale has brought folk\r\nthrough waur snappers than a\xc3\xad this, and there\xc3\xads no a cleverer agent than\r\nNichil Novit e\xc3\xader drew a bill of suspension. Hanged or unhanged, they are\r\nweel aff has sic an agent and counsel; ane\xc3\xads sure o\xc3\xad fair play. Ye are a\r\nbonny lass, too, an ye wad busk up your cockernony a bit; and a bonny\r\nlass will find favour wi\xc3\xad judge and jury, when they would strap up a\r\ngrewsome carle like me for the fifteenth part of a flea\xc3\xads hide and\r\ntallow, d--n them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this homely strain of consolation the mourners returned no answer;\r\nindeed, they were so much lost in their own sorrows as to have become\r\ninsensible of Ratcliffe\xc3\xads presence. \xe2\x80\x9cO Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d said her elder sister,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow could you conceal your situation from me? O woman, had I deserved\r\nthis at your hand?--had ye spoke but ae word--sorry we might hae been,\r\nand shamed we might hae been, but this awfu\xc3\xad dispensation had never come\r\nower us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what gude wad that hae dune?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the prisoner. \xe2\x80\x9cNa, na,\r\nJeanie, a\xc3\xad was ower when ance I forgot what I promised when I faulded\r\ndown the leaf of my Bible. See,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, producing the sacred volume,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe book opens aye at the place o\xc3\xad itsell. O see, Jeanie, what a fearfu\xc3\xad\r\nScripture!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie took her sister\xc3\xads Bible, and found that the fatal mark was made at\r\nthis impressive text in the book of Job: \xe2\x80\x9cHe hath stripped me of my\r\nglory, and taken the crown from my head. He hath destroyed me on every\r\nside, and I am gone. And mine hope hath he removed like a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsna that ower true a doctrine?\xe2\x80\x9d said the prisoner \xe2\x80\x9cIsna my crown, my\r\nhonour, removed? And what am I but a poor, wasted, wan-thriven tree, dug\r\nup by the roots, and flung out to waste in the highway, that man and\r\nbeast may tread it under foot? I thought o\xc3\xad the bonny bit them that our\r\nfather rooted out o\xc3\xad the yard last May, when it had a\xc3\xad the flush o\xc3\xad\r\nblossoms on it; and then it lay in the court till the beasts had trod\r\nthem a\xc3\xad to pieces wi\xc3\xad their feet. I little thought, when I was wae for\r\nthe bit silly green bush and its flowers, that I was to gang the same\r\ngate mysell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, if ye had spoken ae word,\xe2\x80\x9d again sobbed Jeanie,--\xe2\x80\x9cif I were free to\r\nswear that ye had said but ae word of how it stude wi\xc3\xad ye, they couldna\r\nhae touched your life this day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould they na?\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, with something like awakened interest--for\r\nlife is dear even to those who feel it is a burden--\xe2\x80\x9cWha tauld ye that,\r\nJeanie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was ane that kend what he was saying weel eneugh,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie,\r\nwho had a natural reluctance at mentioning even the name of her sister\xc3\xads\r\nseducer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWha was it?--I conjure you to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, seating herself\r\nupright.--\xe2\x80\x9cWha could tak interest in sic a cast-by as I am now?--Was\r\nit--was it _him?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat signifies keeping the poor lassie in a\r\nswither? I\xc3\xadse uphaud it\xc3\xads been Robertson that learned ye that doctrine\r\nwhen ye saw him at Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, catching eagerly at his words--\xe2\x80\x9cwas it him,\r\nJeanie, indeed?--O, I see it was him--poor lad, and I was thinking his\r\nheart was as hard as the nether millstane--and him in sic danger on his\r\nain part--poor George!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomewhat indignant at this burst of tender feeling towards the author of\r\nher misery, Jeanie could not help exclaiming--\xe2\x80\x9cO Effie, how can ye speak\r\nthat gate of sic a man as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe maun forgie our enemies, ye ken,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Effie, with a timid look\r\nand a subdued voice; for her conscience told her what a different\r\ncharacter the feelings with which she regarded her seducer bore, compared\r\nwith the Christian charity under which she attempted to veil it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ye hae suffered a\xc3\xad this for him, and ye can think of loving him\r\nstill?\xe2\x80\x9d said her sister, in a voice betwixt pity and blame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove him!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Effie--\xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadna loved as woman seldom loves, I\r\nhadna been within these wa\xc3\xads this day; and trow ye, that love sic as mine\r\nis lightly forgotten?--Na, na--ye may hew down the tree, but ye canna\r\nchange its bend--And, O Jeanie, if ye wad do good to me at this moment,\r\ntell me every word that he said, and whether he was sorry for poor Effie\r\nor no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat needs I tell ye onything about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie. \xe2\x80\x9cYe may be sure he\r\nhad ower muckle to do to save himsell, to speak lang or muckle about ony\r\nbody beside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jeanie and Effie--304]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads no true, Jeanie, though a saunt had said it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Effie, with\r\na sparkle of her former lively and irritable temper. \xe2\x80\x9cBut ye dinna ken,\r\nthough I do, how far he pat his life in venture to save mine.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nlooking at Ratcliffe, she checked herself and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, with one of his familiar sneers, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lassie\r\nthinks that naebody has een but hersell--Didna I see when Gentle Geordie\r\nwas seeking to get other folk out of the Tolbooth forby Jock\r\nPorteous?--but ye are of my mind, hinny--better sit and rue, than flit\r\nand rue--ye needna look in my face sae amazed. I ken mair things than\r\nthat, maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO my God! my God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, springing up and throwing herself down on\r\nher knees before him--\xe2\x80\x9cD\xc3\xadye ken where they hae putten my bairn?--O my\r\nbairn! my bairn! the poor sackless innocent new-born wee ane--bone of my\r\nbone, and flesh of my flesh!--O man, if ye wad e\xc3\xader deserve a portion in\r\nHeaven, or a brokenhearted creature\xc3\xads blessing upon earth, tell me where\r\nthey hae put my bairn--the sign of my shame, and the partner of my\r\nsuffering! tell me wha has taen\xc3\xadt away, or what they hae dune wi\xc3\xadt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout tout,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey, endeavouring to extricate himself from the\r\nfirm grasp with which she held him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xc3\xads taking me at my word wi\xc3\xad a\r\nwitness--Bairn, quo\xc3\xad she? How the deil suld I ken onything of your bairn,\r\nhuzzy? Ye maun ask that of auld Meg Murdockson, if ye dinna ken ower\r\nmuckle about it yoursell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs his answer destroyed the wild and vague hope which had suddenly\r\ngleamed upon her, the unhappy prisoner let go her hold of his coat, and\r\nfell with her face on the pavement of the apartment in a strong\r\nconvulsion fit.\r\n\r\nJeanie Deans possessed, with her excellently clear understanding, the\r\nconcomitant advantage of promptitude of spirit, even in the extremity of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nShe did not suffer herself to be overcome by her own feelings of\r\nexquisite sorrow, but instantly applied herself to her sister\xc3\xads relief,\r\nwith the readiest remedies which circumstances afforded; and which, to do\r\nRatcliffe justice, he showed himself anxious to suggest, and alert in\r\nprocuring. He had even the delicacy to withdraw to the farthest corner of\r\nthe room, so as to render his official attendance upon them as little\r\nintrusive as possible, when Effie was composed enough again to resume her\r\nconference with her sister.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner once more, in the most earnest and broken tones, conjured\r\nJeanie to tell her the particulars of the conference with Robertson, and\r\nJeanie felt it was impossible to refuse her this gratification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo ye mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cEffie, when ye were in the fever before we left\r\nWoodend, and how angry your mother, that\xc3\xads now in a better place, was wi\xc3\xad\r\nme for gieing ye milk and water to drink, because ye grat for it? Ye were\r\na bairn then, and ye are a woman now, and should ken better than ask what\r\ncanna but hurt you--But come weal or woe, I canna refuse ye onything that\r\nye ask me wi\xc3\xad the tear in your ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Effie threw herself into her arms, and kissed her cheek and\r\nforehead, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cO, if ye kend how lang it is since I heard his name\r\nmentioned?--if ye but kend how muckle good it does me but to ken onything\r\no\xc3\xad him, that\xc3\xads like goodness or kindness, ye wadna wonder that I wish to\r\nhear o\xc3\xad him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie sighed, and commenced her narrative of all that had passed betwixt\r\nRobertson and her, making it as brief as possible. Effie listened in\r\nbreathless anxiety, holding her sister\xc3\xads hand in hers, and keeping her\r\neye fixed upon her face, as if devouring every word she uttered. The\r\ninterjections of \xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cPoor George,\xe2\x80\x9d which escaped in\r\nwhispers, and betwixt sighs, were the only sounds with which she\r\ninterrupted the story. When it was finished she made a long pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this was his advice?\xe2\x80\x9d were the first words she uttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust sic as I hae tell\xc3\xadd ye,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he wanted you to say something to yon folks, that wad save my young\r\nlife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I suld be man-sworn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you tauld him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat ye wadna hear o\xc3\xad coming between me\r\nand the death that I am to die, and me no aughten year auld yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie, who now trembled at the turn which her\r\nsister\xc3\xads reflection seemed about to take, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I daured na swear to an\r\nuntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what d\xc3\xadye ca\xc3\xad an untruth?\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, again showing a touch of her\r\nformer spirit--\xe2\x80\x9cYe are muckle to blame, lass, if ye think a mother would,\r\nor could, murder her ain bairn--Murder!--I wad hae laid down my life just\r\nto see a blink o\xc3\xad its ee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat ye are as innocent of sic a purpose as\r\nthe new-born babe itsell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad ye do me that justice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, haughtily; \xe2\x80\x9cifs whiles the\r\nfaut of very good folk like you, Jeanie, that, they think a\xc3\xad the rest of\r\nthe warld are as bad as the warst temptations can make them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didna deserve this frae ye, Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d said her sister, sobbing, and\r\nfeeling at once the injustice of the reproach, and compassion for the\r\nstate of mind which dictated it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe no, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie. \xe2\x80\x9cBut ye are angry because I love\r\nRobertson--How can I help loving him, that loves me better than body and\r\nsoul baith?--Here he put his life in a niffer, to break the prison to let\r\nme out; and sure am I, had it stude wi\xc3\xad him as it stands wi\xc3\xad you\xe2\x80\x9d--Here\r\nshe paused and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, if it stude wi\xc3\xad me to save ye wi\xc3\xad risk of my life!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, lass,\xe2\x80\x9d said her sister, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xc3\xads lightly said, but no sae lightly\r\ncredited, frae ane that winna ware a word for me; and if it be a wrang\r\nword, ye\xc3\xadll hae time eneugh to repent o\xc3\xadt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that word is a grievous sin, and it\xc3\xads a deeper offence when it\xc3\xads a\r\nsin wilfully and presumptuously committed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, weel, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, \xe2\x80\x9cI mind a\xc3\xad about the sins o\xc3\xad\r\npresumption in the questions--we\xc3\xadll speak nae mair about this matter, and\r\nye may save your breath to say your carritch and for me, I\xc3\xadll soon hae\r\nnae breath to waste on onybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must needs say,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xc3\xads d--d hard, when\r\nthree words of your mouth would give the girl the chance to nick Moll\r\nBlood,* that you make such scrupling about rapping** to them. D--n me, if\r\nthey would take me, if I would not rap to all what d\xc3\xadye callums--Hyssop\xc3\xads\r\nFables, for her life--I am us\xc3\xadd to\xc3\xadt, b--t me, for less matters. Why, I\r\nhave smacked calf-skin*** fifty times in England for a keg of brandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* The gallows.\r\n** Swearing.\r\n*** Kissed the book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever speak mair o\xc3\xadt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prisoner. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads just as weel as it\r\nis--and gude-day, sister; ye keep Mr. Ratcliffe waiting on--Ye\xc3\xadll come\r\nback and see me, I reckon, before\xe2\x80\x9d--here she stopped and became deadly\r\npale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are we to part in this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cand you in sic deadly\r\nperil? O Effie, look but up, and say what ye wad hae me to do, and I\r\ncould find in my heart amaist to say that I wad do\xc3\xadt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her sister after an effort, \xe2\x80\x9cI am better minded\r\nnow. At my best, I was never half sae gude as ye were, and what for suld\r\nyou begin to mak yoursell waur to save me, now that I am no worth saving?\r\nGod knows, that in my sober mind, I wadna wuss ony living creature to do\r\na wrang thing to save my life. I might have fled frae this Tolbooth on\r\nthat awfu\xc3\xad night wi\xc3\xad ane wad hae carried me through the warld, and\r\nfriended me, and fended for me. But I said to them, let life gang when\r\ngude fame is gane before it. But this lang imprisonment has broken my\r\nspirit, and I am whiles sair left to mysell, and then I wad gie the\r\nIndian mines of gold and diamonds, just for life and breath--for I think,\r\nJeanie, I have such roving fits as I used to hae in the fever; but,\r\ninstead of the fiery een and wolves, and Widow Butler\xc3\xads bullseg, that I\r\nused to see spieling upon my bed, I am thinking now about a high, black\r\ngibbet, and me standing up, and such seas of faces all looking up at poor\r\nEffie Deans, and asking if it be her that George Robertson used to call\r\nthe Lily of St. Leonard\xc3\xads. And then they stretch out their faces, and\r\nmake mouths, and girn at me, and whichever way I look, I see a face\r\nlaughing like Meg Murdockson, when she tauld me I had seen the last of my\r\nwean. God preserve us, Jeanie, that carline has a fearsome face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands before her eyes as she uttered this exclamation, as\r\nif to secure herself against seeing the fearful object she had alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\nJeanie Deans remained with her sister for two hours, during which she\r\nendeavoured, if possible, to extract something from her that might be\r\nserviceable in her exculpation. But she had nothing to say beyond what\r\nshe had declared on her first examination, with the purport of which the\r\nreader will be made acquainted in proper time and place. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wadna\r\nbelieve her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand she had naething mair to tell them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length, Ratcliffe, though reluctantly, informed the sisters that there\r\nwas a necessity that they should part. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Novit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to see\r\nthe prisoner, and maybe Mr. Langtale too. Langtale likes to look at a\r\nbonny lass, whether in prison or out o\xc3\xad prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReluctantly, therefore, and slowly, after many a tear, and many an\r\nembrace, Jeanie retired from the apartment, and heard its jarring bolts\r\nturned upon the dear being from whom she was separated. Somewhat\r\nfamiliarised now even with her rude conductor, she offered him a small\r\npresent in money, with a request he would do what he could for her\r\nsister\xc3\xads accommodation. To her surprise, Ratcliffe declined the fee.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasna bloody when I was on the pad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I winna be\r\ngreedy--that is, beyond what\xc3\xads right and reasonable--now that I am in\r\nthe lock.--Keep the siller; and for civility, your sister sall hae sic\r\nas I can bestow; but I hope you\xc3\xadll think better on it, and rap an oath\r\nfor her--deil a hair ill there is in it, if ye are rapping again the\r\ncrown. I kend a worthy minister, as gude a man, bating the deed they\r\ndeposed him for, as ever ye heard claver in a pu\xc3\xadpit, that rapped to a\r\nhogshead of pigtail tobacco, just for as muckle as filled his\r\nspleuchan.*\r\n\r\n* Tobacco-pouch.\r\n\r\nBut maybe ye are keeping your ain counsel--weel, weel, there\xc3\xads nae harm\r\nin that. As for your sister, I\xc3\xadse see that she gets her meat clean and\r\nwarm, and I\xc3\xadll try to gar her lie down and take a sleep after dinner, for\r\ndeil a ee she\xc3\xadll close the night. I hae gude experience of these matters.\r\nThe first night is aye the warst o\xc3\xadt. I hae never heard o\xc3\xad ane that\r\nsleepit the night afore trial, but of mony a ane that sleepit as sound as\r\na tap the night before their necks were straughted. And it\xc3\xads nae\r\nwonder--the warst may be tholed when it\xc3\xads kend--Better a finger aff\r\nas aye wagging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTIETH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Yet though thou mayst be dragg\xc3\xadd in scorn\r\n                      To yonder ignominious tree,\r\n                Thou shalt not want one faithful friend\r\n                     To share the cruel fates\xc3\xad decree.\r\n                                          Jemmy Dawson.\r\n\r\nAfter spending the greater part of the morning in his devotions (for his\r\nbenevolent neighbours had kindly insisted upon discharging his task of\r\nordinary labour), David Deans entered the apartment when the breakfast\r\nmeal was prepared. His eyes were involuntarily cast down, for he was\r\nafraid to look at Jeanie, uncertain as he was whether she might feel\r\nherself at liberty, with a good conscience, to attend the Court of\r\nJusticiary that day, to give the evidence which he understood that she\r\npossessed, in order to her sister\xc3\xads exculpation. At length, after a\r\nminute of apprehensive hesitation, he looked at her dress to discover\r\nwhether it seemed to be in her contemplation to go abroad that morning.\r\nHer apparel was neat and plain, but such as conveyed no exact intimation\r\nof her intentions to go abroad. She had exchanged her usual garb for\r\nmorning labour, for one something inferior to that with which, as her\r\nbest, she was wont to dress herself for church, or any more rare occasion\r\nof going into society. Her sense taught her, that it was respectful to be\r\ndecent in her apparel on such an occasion, while her feelings induced her\r\nto lay aside the use of the very few and simple personal ornaments,\r\nwhich, on other occasions, she permitted herself to wear. So that there\r\noccurred nothing in her external appearance which could mark out to her\r\nfather, with anything like certainty, her intentions on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for their humble meal were that morning made in vain.\r\nThe father and daughter sat, each assuming the appearance of eating, when\r\nthe other\xc3\xads eyes were turned to them, and desisting from the effort with\r\ndisgust, when the affectionate imposture seemed no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nAt length these moments of constraint were removed. The sound of St.\r\nGiles\xc3\xads heavy toll announced the hour previous to the commencement of the\r\ntrial; Jeanie arose, and with a degree of composure for which she herself\r\ncould not account, assumed her plaid, and made her other preparations for\r\na distant walking. It was a strange contrast between the firmness of her\r\ndemeanour, and the vacillation and cruel uncertainty of purpose indicated\r\nin all her father\xc3\xads motions; and one unacquainted with both could\r\nscarcely have supposed that the former was, in her ordinary habits of\r\nlife, a docile, quiet, gentle, and even timid country maiden, while her\r\nfather, with a mind naturally proud and strong, and supported by\r\nreligious opinions of a stern, stoical, and unyielding character, had in\r\nhis time undergone and withstood the most severe hardships, and the most\r\nimminent peril, without depression of spirit, or subjugation of his\r\nconstancy. The secret of this difference was, that Jeanie\xc3\xads mind had\r\nalready anticipated the line of conduct which she must adopt, with all\r\nits natural and necessary consequences; while her father, ignorant of\r\nevery other circumstance, tormented himself with imagining what the one\r\nsister might say or swear, or what effect her testimony might have upon\r\nthe awful event of the trial.\r\n\r\nHe watched his daughter, with a faltering and indecisive look, until she\r\nlooked back upon him, with a look of unutterable anguish, as she was\r\nabout to leave the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lassie,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d His action, hastily and confusedly\r\nsearching for his worsted mittans* and staff, showed his purpose of\r\naccompanying her, though his tongue failed distinctly to announce it.\r\n\r\n* A kind of worsted gloves, used by the lower orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, replying rather to his action than his words, \xe2\x80\x9cye\r\nhad better not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the strength of my God,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Deans, assuming firmness, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\ngo forth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, taking his daughter\xc3\xads arm under his, he began to walk from the door\r\nwith a step so hasty, that she was almost unable to keep up with him. A\r\ntrifling circumstance, but which marked the perturbed state of his mind,\r\nchecked his course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour bonnet, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who observed he had come out with his\r\ngrey hairs uncovered. He turned back with a slight blush on his cheek,\r\nbeing ashamed to have been detected in an omission which indicated so\r\nmuch mental confusion, assumed his large blue Scottish bonnet, and with a\r\nstep slower, but more composed, as if the circumstance, had obliged him\r\nto summon up his resolution, and collect his scattered ideas, again\r\nplaced his daughter\xc3\xads arm under his, and resumed the way to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe courts of justice were then, and are still, held in what is called\r\nthe Parliament Close, or, according to modern phrase, Parliament Square,\r\nand occupied the buildings intended for the accommodation of the Scottish\r\nEstates. This edifice, though in an imperfect and corrupted style of\r\narchitecture, had then a grave, decent, and, as it were, a judicial\r\naspect, which was at least entitled to respect from its antiquity. For\r\nwhich venerable front, I observed, on my last occasional visit to the\r\nmetropolis, that modern taste had substituted, at great apparent expense,\r\na pile so utterly inconsistent with every monument of antiquity around,\r\nand in itself so clumsy at the same time and fantastic, that it may be\r\nlikened to the decorations of Tom Errand the porter, in the _Trip to the\r\nJubilee,_ when he appears bedizened with the tawdry finery of Beau\r\nClincher. _Sed transeat cum caeteris erroribus._\r\n\r\nThe small quadrangle, or Close, if we may presume still to give it that\r\nappropriate, though antiquated title, which at Lichfield, Salisbury, and\r\nelsewhere, is properly applied to designate the enclosure adjacent to a\r\ncathedral, already evinced tokens of the fatal scene which was that day\r\nto be acted. The soldiers of the City Guard were on their posts, now\r\nenduring, and now rudely repelling with the butts of their muskets, the\r\nmotley crew who thrust each other forward, to catch a glance at the\r\nunfortunate object of trial, as she should pass from the adjacent prison\r\nto the Court in which her fate was to be determined. All must have\r\noccasionally observed, with disgust, the apathy with which the vulgar\r\ngaze on scenes of this nature, and how seldom, unless when their\r\nsympathies are called forth by some striking and extraordinary\r\ncircumstance, the crowd evince any interest deeper than that of callous,\r\nunthinking bustle, and brutal curiosity. They laugh, jest, quarrel, and\r\npush each other to and fro, with the same unfeeling indifference as if\r\nthey were assembled for some holiday sport, or to see an idle procession.\r\nOccasionally, however, this demeanour, so natural to the degraded\r\npopulace of a large town, is exchanged for a temporary touch of human\r\naffections; and so it chanced on the present occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen Deans and his daughter presented themselves in the Close, and\r\nendeavoured to make their way forward to the door of the Court-house,\r\nthey became involved in the mob, and subject, of course, to their\r\ninsolence. As Deans repelled with some force the rude pushes which he\r\nreceived on all sides, his figure and antiquated dress caught the\r\nattention of the rabble, who often show an intuitive sharpness in\r\nascribing the proper character from external appearance,--\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xc3\xadre welcome, whigs,\r\n                         Frae Bothwell briggs,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nsung one fellow (for the mob of Edinburgh were at that time jacobitically\r\ndisposed, probably because that was the line of sentiment most\r\ndiametrically opposite to existing authority).\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cMess David Williamson,\r\n                           Chosen of twenty,\r\n                       Ran up the pu\xc3\xadpit stair,\r\n                           And sang Killiecrankie,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nchanted a siren, whose profession might be guessed by her appearance. A\r\ntattered caidie, or errand-porter, whom David Deans had jostled in his\r\nattempt to extricate himself from the vicinity of these scorners,\r\nexclaimed in a strong north-country tone, \xe2\x80\x9cTa deil ding out her\r\nCameronian een--what gies her titles to dunch gentlemans about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake room for the ruling elder,\xe2\x80\x9d said yet another; \xe2\x80\x9che comes to see a\r\nprecious sister glorify God in the Grassmarket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhisht; shame\xc3\xads in ye, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice of a man very loudly,\r\nwhich, as quickly sinking, said in a low but distinct tone, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads her\r\nfather and sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll fell back to make way for the sufferers; and all, even the very\r\nrudest and most profligate, were struck with shame and silence. In the\r\nspace thus abandoned to them by the mob, Deans stood, holding his\r\ndaughter by the hand, and said to her, with a countenance strongly and\r\nsternly expressive of his internal emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cYe hear with your ears, and\r\nye see with your eyes, where and to whom the backslidings and defections\r\nof professors are ascribed by the scoffers. Not to themselves alone, but\r\nto the kirk of which they are members, and to its blessed and invisible\r\nHead. Then, weel may we take wi\xc3\xad patience our share and portion of this\r\noutspreading reproach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man who had spoken, no other than our old friend, Dumbiedikes, whose\r\nmouth, like that of the prophet\xc3\xads ass, had been opened by the emergency\r\nof the case, now joined them, and, with his usual taciturnity, escorted\r\nthem into the Court-house. No opposition was offered to their entrance\r\neither by the guards or doorkeepers; and it is even said that one of the\r\nlatter refused a shilling of civility-money tendered him by the Laird of\r\nDumbiedikes, who was of opinion that \xe2\x80\x9csiller wad make a\xc3\xad easy.\xe2\x80\x9d But this\r\nlast incident wants confirmation.\r\n\r\nAdmitted within the precincts of the Court-house, they found the usual\r\nnumber of busy office-bearers, and idle loiterers, who attend on these\r\nscenes by choice, or from duty. Burghers gaped and stared; young lawyers\r\nsauntered, sneered, and laughed, as in the pit of the theatre; while\r\nothers apart sat on a bench retired, and reasoned highly, _inter apices\r\njuris,_ on the doctrines of constructive crime, and the true import of\r\nthe statute. The bench was prepared for the arrival of the judges. The\r\njurors were in attendance. The crown-counsel, employed in looking over\r\ntheir briefs and notes of evidence, looked grave, and whispered with each\r\nother. They occupied one side of a large table placed beneath the bench;\r\non the other sat the advocates, whom the humanity of the Scottish law (in\r\nthis particular more liberal than that of the sister-country) not only\r\npermits, but enjoins, to appear and assist with their advice and skill\r\nall persons under trial. Mr. Nichil Novit was seen actively instructing\r\nthe counsel for the panel (so the prisoner is called in Scottish\r\nlaw-phraseology), busy, bustling, and important. When they entered the\r\nCourt-room, Deans asked the Laird, in a tremulous whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere will\r\n_she_ sit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDumbiedikes whispered Novit, who pointed to a vacant space at the bar,\r\nfronting the judges, and was about to conduct Deans towards it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot sit by her--I cannot own her--not as yet,\r\nat least--I will keep out of her sight, and turn mine own eyes\r\nelsewhere--better for us baith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaddletree, whose repeated interference with the counsel had procured him\r\none or two rebuffs, and a special request that he would concern himself\r\nwith his own matters, now saw with pleasure an opportunity of playing the\r\nperson of importance. He bustled up to the poor old man, and proceeded to\r\nexhibit his consequence, by securing, through his interest with the\r\nbar-keepers and macers, a seat for Deans, in a situation where he was\r\nhidden from the general eye by the projecting corner of the bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads gude to have a friend at court,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, continuing his heartless\r\nharangues to the passive auditor, who neither heard nor replied to them;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfew folk but mysell could hae sorted ye out a seat like this--the Lords\r\nwill be here incontinent, and proceed _instanter_ to trial. They wunna\r\nfence the Court as they do at the Circuit--the High Court of Justiciary\r\nis aye fenced.--But, Lord\xc3\xads sake, what\xc3\xads this o\xc3\xadt--Jeanie, ye are a cited\r\nwitness--Macer, this lass is a witness--she maun be enclosed--she maun on\r\nnae account be at large.--Mr. Novit, suldna Jeanie Deans be enclosed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNovit answered in the affirmative, and offered to conduct Jeanie to the\r\napartment, where, according to the scrupulous practice of the Scottish\r\nCourt, the witnesses remain in readiness to be called into Court to give\r\nevidence; and separated, at the same time, from all who might influence\r\ntheir testimony, or give them information concerning that which was\r\npassing upon the trial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, still reluctant to quit her father\xc3\xads\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA matter of absolute needcessity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cwha ever heard of\r\nwitnesses no being enclosed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is really a matter of necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger counsellor,\r\nretained for her sister; and Jeanie reluctantly followed the macer of the\r\nCourt to the place appointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, Mr. Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cis ca\xc3\xadd sequestering a witness; but\r\nit\xc3\xads clean different (whilk maybe ye wadna fund out o\xc3\xad yoursell) frae\r\nsequestering ane\xc3\xads estate or effects, as in cases of bankruptcy. I hae\r\naften been sequestered as a witness, for the Sheriff is in the use whiles\r\nto cry me in to witness the declarations at precognitions, and so is Mr.\r\nSharpitlaw; but I was ne\xc3\xader like to be sequestered o\xc3\xad land and gudes but\r\nance, and that was lang syne, afore I was married. But whisht, whisht!\r\nhere\xc3\xads the Court coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the five Lords of Justiciary, in their long robes of\r\nscarlet, faced with white, and preceded by their mace-bearer, entered\r\nwith the usual formalities, and took their places upon the bench of\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe audience rose to receive them; and the bustle occasioned by their\r\nentrance was hardly composed, when a great noise and confusion of persons\r\nstruggling, and forcibly endeavouring to enter at the doors of the\r\nCourt-room, and of the galleries, announced that the prisoner was about\r\nto be placed at the bar. This tumult takes place when the doors, at first\r\nonly opened to those either having right to be present, or to the better\r\nand more qualified ranks, are at length laid open to all whose curiosity\r\ninduces them to be present on the occasion. With inflamed countenances\r\nand dishevelled dresses, struggling with, and sometimes tumbling over\r\neach other, in rushed the rude multitude, while a few soldiers, forming,\r\nas it were, the centre of the tide, could scarce, with all their efforts,\r\nclear a passage for the prisoner to the place which she was to occupy. By\r\nthe authority of the Court, and the exertions of its officers, the tumult\r\namong the spectators was at length appeased, and the unhappy girl brought\r\nforward, and placed betwixt two sentinels with drawn bayonets, as a\r\nprisoner at the bar, where she was to abide her deliverance for good or\r\nevil, according to the issue of her trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n            We have strict statutes, and most biting laws--\r\n            The needful bits and curbs for headstrong steeds--\r\n            Which, for these fourteen years, we have let sleep,\r\n                 Like to an o\xc3\xadergrown lion in a cave,\r\n                      That goes not out to prey.\r\n                                        Measure for Measure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEuphemia Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d said the presiding Judge, in an accent in which pity\r\nwas blended with dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cstand up and listen to the criminal indictment\r\nnow to be preferred against you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unhappy girl, who had been stupified by the confusion through which\r\nthe guards had forced a passage, cast a bewildered look on the multitude\r\nof faces around her, which seemed to tapestry, as it were, the walls, in\r\none broad slope from the ceiling to the floor, with human countenances,\r\nand instinctively obeyed a command, which rung in her ears like the\r\ntrumpet of the judgment-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut back your hair, Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the macers. For her beautiful\r\nand abundant tresses of long fair hair, which, according to the costume\r\nof the country, unmarried women were not allowed to cover with any sort\r\nof cap, and which, alas! Effie dared no longer confine with the snood or\r\nriband, which implied purity of maiden-fame, now hung unbound and\r\ndishevelled over her face, and almost concealed her features. On\r\nreceiving this hint from the attendant, the unfortunate young woman, with\r\na hasty, trembling, and apparently mechanical compliance, shaded back\r\nfrom her face her luxuriant locks, and showed to the whole court,\r\nexcepting one individual, a countenance, which, though pale and\r\nemaciated, was so lovely amid its agony, that it called forth a universal\r\nmurmur of compassion and sympathy. Apparently the expressive sound of\r\nhuman feeling recalled the poor girl from the stupor of fear, which\r\npredominated at first over every other sensation, and awakened her to the\r\nno less painful sense of shame and exposure attached to her present\r\nsituation. Her eye, which had at first glanced wildly around, was turned\r\non the ground; her cheek, at first so deadly pale, began gradually to be\r\noverspread with a faint blush, which increased so fast, that, when in\r\nagony of shame she strove to conceal her face, her temples, her brow, her\r\nneck, and all that her slender fingers and small palms could not cover,\r\nbecame of the deepest crimson.\r\n\r\nAll marked and were moved by these changes, excepting one. It was old\r\nDeans, who, motionless in his seat, and concealed, as we have said, by\r\nthe corner of the bench, from seeing or being seen, did nevertheless keep\r\nhis eyes firmly fixed on the ground, as if determined that, by no\r\npossibility whatever, would he be an ocular witness of the shame of his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIchabod!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself--\xe2\x80\x9cIchabod! my glory is departed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile these reflections were passing through his mind, the indictment,\r\nwhich set forth in technical form the crime of which the panel stood\r\naccused, was read as usual, and the prisoner was asked if she was Guilty,\r\nor Not Guilty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot guilty of my poor bairn\xc3\xads death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie Deans, in an accent\r\ncorresponding in plaintive softness of tone to the beauty of her\r\nfeatures, and which was not heard by the audience without emotion.\r\n\r\nThe presiding Judge next directed the counsel to plead to the relevancy;\r\nthat is, to state on either part the arguments in point of law, and\r\nevidence in point of fact, against and in favour of the criminal; after\r\nwhich it is the form of the Court to pronounce a preliminary judgment,\r\nsending the cause to the cognisance of the jury, or assize.\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the crown briefly stated the frequency of the crime of\r\ninfanticide, which had given rise to the special statute under which the\r\npanel stood indicted. He mentioned the various instances, many of them\r\nmarked with circumstances of atrocity, which had at length induced the\r\nKing\xc3\xads Advocate, though with great reluctance, to make the experiment,\r\nwhether, by strictly enforcing the Act of Parliament which had been made\r\nto prevent such enormities, their occurrence might be prevented. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nexpected,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto be able to establish by witnesses, as well as by\r\nthe declaration of the panel herself, that she was in the state described\r\nby the statute. According to his information, the panel had communicated\r\nher pregnancy to no one, nor did she allege in her own declaration that\r\nshe had done so. This secrecy was the first requisite in support of the\r\nindictment. The same declaration admitted, that she had borne a male\r\nchild, in circumstances which gave but too much reason to believe it had\r\ndied by the hands, or at least with the knowledge or consent, of the\r\nunhappy mother. It was not, however, necessary for him to bring positive\r\nproof that the panel was accessory to the murder, nay, nor even to prove,\r\nthat the child was murdered at all. It was sufficient to support the\r\nindictment, that it could not be found. According to the stern, but\r\nnecessary severity of this statute, she who should conceal her pregnancy,\r\nwho should omit to call that assistance which is most necessary on such\r\noccasions, was held already to have meditated the death of her offspring,\r\nas an event most likely to be the consequence of her culpable and cruel\r\nconcealment. And if, under such circumstances, she could not\r\nalternatively show by proof that the infant had died a natural death, or\r\nproduce it still in life, she must, under the construction of the law, be\r\nheld to have murdered it, and suffer death accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the prisoner, Mr. Fairbrother, a man of considerable fame\r\nin his profession, did not pretend directly to combat the arguments of\r\nthe King\xc3\xads Advocate. He began by lamenting that his senior at the bar,\r\nMr. Langtale, had been suddenly called to the county of which he was\r\nsheriff, and that he had been applied to, on short warning, to give the\r\npanel his assistance in this interesting case. He had had little time, he\r\nsaid, to make up for his inferiority to his learned brother by long and\r\nminute research; and he was afraid he might give a specimen of his\r\nincapacity, by being compelled to admit the accuracy of the indictment\r\nunder the statute. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was enough for their Lordships,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nknow that such was the law, and he admitted the advocate had a right to\r\ncall for the usual interlocutor of relevancy.\xe2\x80\x9d But he stated, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when\r\nhe came to establish his case by proof, he trusted to make out\r\ncircumstances which would satisfactorily elide the charge in the libel.\r\nHis client\xc3\xads story was a short, but most melancholy one. She was bred up\r\nin the strictest tenets of religion and virtue, the daughter of a worthy\r\nand conscientious person, who, in evil times, had established a character\r\nfor courage and religion, by becoming a sufferer for conscience\xc3\xad sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid Deans gave a convulsive start at hearing himself thus mentioned,\r\nand then resumed the situation, in which, with his face stooped against\r\nhis hands, and both resting against the corner of the elevated bench on\r\nwhich the Judges sate, he had hitherto listened to the procedure in the\r\ntrial. The Whig lawyers seemed to be interested; the Tories put up their\r\nlip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever may be our difference of opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the lawyer, whose\r\nbusiness it was to carry his whole audience with him if possible,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cconcerning the peculiar tenets of these people\xe2\x80\x9d (here Deans groaned\r\ndeeply), \xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible to deny them the praise of sound, and even\r\nrigid morals, or the merit of training up their children in the fear of\r\nGod; and yet it was the daughter of such a person whom a jury would\r\nshortly be called upon, in the absence of evidence, and upon mere\r\npresumptions, to convict of a crime more properly belonging to a heathen,\r\nor a savage, than to a Christian and civilised country. It was true,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadmitted, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the excellent nurture and early instruction which the\r\npoor girl had received, had not been sufficient to preserve her from\r\nguilt and error. She had fallen a sacrifice to an inconsiderate affection\r\nfor a young man of prepossessing manners, as he had been informed, but of\r\na very dangerous and desperate character. She was seduced under promise\r\nof marriage--a promise, which the fellow might have, perhaps, done her\r\njustice by keeping, had he not at that time been called upon by the law\r\nto atone for a crime, violent and desperate in itself, but which became\r\nthe preface to another eventful history, every step of which was marked\r\nby blood and guilt, and the final termination of which had not even yet\r\narrived. He believed that no one would hear him without surprise, when he\r\nstated that the father of this infant now amissing, and said by the\r\nlearned Advocate to have been murdered, was no other than the notorious\r\nGeorge Robertson, the accomplice of Wilson, the hero of the memorable\r\nescape from the Tolbooth Church, and as no one knew better than his\r\nlearned friend the Advocate, the principal actor in the Porteous\r\nconspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to interrupt a counsel in such a case as the present,\xe2\x80\x9d said,\r\nthe presiding Judge; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must remind the learned gentleman that he is\r\ntravelling out of the case before us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe counsel bowed and resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe only judged it necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto mention the name and situation of Robertson, because the circumstance\r\nin which that character was placed, went a great way in accounting for\r\nthe silence on which his Majesty\xc3\xads counsel had laid so much weight, as\r\naffording proof that his client proposed to allow no fair play for its\r\nlife to the helpless being whom she was about to bring into the world.\r\nShe had not announced to her friends that she had been seduced from the\r\npath of honour--and why had she not done so?--Because she expected daily\r\nto be restored to character, by her seducer doing her that justice which\r\nshe knew to be in his power, and believed to be in his inclination. Was\r\nit natural--was it reasonable--was it fair, to expect that she should in\r\nthe interim, become _felo de se_ of her own character, and proclaim her\r\nfrailty to the world, when she had every reason to expect, that, by\r\nconcealing it for a season, it might be veiled for ever? Was it not, on\r\nthe contrary, pardonable, that, in such an emergency, a young woman, in\r\nsuch a situation, should be found far from disposed to make a confidant\r\nof every prying gossip, who, with sharp eyes, and eager ears, pressed\r\nupon her for an explanation of suspicious circumstances, which females in\r\nthe lower--he might say which females of all ranks, are so alert in\r\nnoticing, that they sometimes discover them where they do not exist? Was\r\nit strange or was it criminal, that she should have repelled their\r\ninquisitive impertinence with petulant denials? The sense and feeling of\r\nall who heard him would answer directly in the negative. But although his\r\nclient had thus remained silent towards those to whom she was not called\r\nupon to communicate her situation,--to whom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the learned gentleman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will add, it would have been unadvised and improper in her to have\r\ndone so; yet, I trust, I shall remove this case most triumphantly from\r\nunder the statute, and obtain the unfortunate young woman an honourable\r\ndismission from your Lordships\xc3\xad bar, by showing that she did, in due time\r\nand place, and to a person most fit for such confidence, mention the\r\ncalamitous circumstances in which she found herself. This occurred after\r\nRobertson\xc3\xads conviction, and when he was lying in prison in expectation of\r\nthe fate which his comrade Wilson afterwards suffered, and from which he\r\nhimself so strangely escaped. It was then, when all hopes of having her\r\nhonour repaired by wedlock vanished from her eyes,--when an union with\r\none in Robertson\xc3\xads situation, if still practicable, might, perhaps, have\r\nbeen regarded rather as an addition to her disgrace,--it was _then,_ that\r\nI trust to be able to prove that the prisoner communicated and consulted\r\nwith her sister, a young woman several years older than herself, the\r\ndaughter of her father, if I mistake not, by a former marriage, upon the\r\nperils and distress of her unhappy situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf, indeed, you are able to instruct _that_ point, Mr. Fairbrother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the presiding Judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am indeed able to instruct that point, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr.\r\nFairbrother, \xe2\x80\x9cI trust not only to serve my client, but to relieve your\r\nLordships from that which I know you feel the most painful duty of your\r\nhigh office; and to give all who now hear me the exquisite pleasure of\r\nbeholding a creature, so young, so ingenuous, and so beautiful, as she\r\nthat is now at the bar of your Lordships\xc3\xad Court, dismissed from thence in\r\nsafety and in honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis address seemed to affect many of the audience, and was followed by a\r\nslight murmur of applause. Deans, as he heard his daughter\xc3\xads beauty and\r\ninnocent appearance appealed to, was involuntarily about to turn his eyes\r\ntowards her; but, recollecting himself, he bent them again on the ground\r\nwith stubborn resolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill not my learned brother, on the other side of the bar,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nthe advocate, after a short pause, \xe2\x80\x9cshare in this general joy, since, I\r\nknow, while he discharges his duty in bringing an accused person here, no\r\none rejoices more in their being freely and honourably sent hence? My\r\nlearned brother shakes his head doubtfully, and lays his hand on the\r\npanel\xc3\xads declaration. I understand him perfectly--he would insinuate that\r\nthe facts now stated to your Lordships are inconsistent with the\r\nconfession of Euphemia Deans herself. I need not remind your Lordships,\r\nthat her present defence is no whit to be narrowed within the bounds of\r\nher former confession; and that it is not by any account which she may\r\nformerly have given of herself, but by what is now to be proved for or\r\nagainst her, that she must ultimately stand or fall. I am not under the\r\nnecessity of accounting for her choosing to drop out of her declaration\r\nthe circumstances of her confession to her sister. She might not be aware\r\nof its importance; she might be afraid of implicating her sister; she\r\nmight even have forgotten the circumstance entirely, in the terror and\r\ndistress of mind incidental to the arrest of so young a creature on a\r\ncharge so heinous. Any of these reasons are sufficient to account for her\r\nhaving suppressed the truth in this instance, at whatever risk to\r\nherself; and I incline most to her erroneous fear of criminating her\r\nsister, because I observe she has had a similar tenderness towards her\r\nlover (however undeserved on his part), and has never once mentioned\r\nRobertson\xc3\xads name from beginning to end of her declaration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my Lords,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Fairbrother, \xe2\x80\x9cI am aware the King\xc3\xads Advocate\r\nwill expect me to show, that the proof I offer is consistent with other\r\ncircumstances of the case, which I do not and cannot deny. He will\r\ndemand of me how Effie Deans\xc3\xads confession to her sister, previous to her\r\ndelivery, is reconcilable with the mystery of the birth,--with the\r\ndisappearance, perhaps the murder (for I will not deny a possibility\r\nwhich I cannot disprove) of the infant. My Lords, the explanation of this\r\nis to be found in the placability, perchance, I may say, in the facility\r\nand pliability, of the female sex. The _dulcis Amaryllidis irae,_ as your\r\nLordships well know, are easily appeased; nor is it possible to conceive\r\na woman so atrociously offended by the man whom she has loved, but that\r\nshe will retain a fund of forgiveness, upon which his penitence, whether\r\nreal or affected, may draw largely, with a certainty that his bills will\r\nbe answered. We can prove, by a letter produced in evidence, that this\r\nvillain Robertson, from the bottom of the dungeon whence he already\r\nprobably meditated the escape, which he afterwards accomplished by the\r\nassistance of his comrade, contrived to exercise authority over the mind,\r\nand to direct the motions, of this unhappy girl. It was in compliance\r\nwith his injunctions, expressed in that letter, that the panel was\r\nprevailed upon to alter the line of conduct which her own better thoughts\r\nhad suggested; and, instead of resorting, when her time of travail\r\napproached, to the protection of her own family, was induced to confide\r\nherself to the charge of some vile agent of this nefarious seducer, and\r\nby her conducted to one of those solitary and secret purlieus of villany,\r\nwhich, to the shame of our police, still are suffered to exist in the\r\nsuburbs of this city, where, with the assistance, and under the charge,\r\nof a person of her own sex, she bore a male child, under circumstances\r\nwhich added treble bitterness to the woe denounced against our original\r\nmother. What purpose Robertson had in all this, it is hard to tell, or\r\neven to guess. He may have meant to marry the girl, for her father is a\r\nman of substance. But, for the termination of the story, and the conduct\r\nof the woman whom he had placed about the person of Euphemia Deans, it is\r\nstill more difficult to account. The unfortunate young woman was visited\r\nby the fever incidental to her situation. In this fever she appears to\r\nhave been deceived by the person that waited on her, and, on recovering\r\nher senses, she found that she was childless in that abode of misery. Her\r\ninfant had been carried off, perhaps for the worst purposes, by the\r\nwretch that waited on her. It may have been murdered, for what I can\r\ntell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was here interrupted by a piercing shriek, uttered by the unfortunate\r\nprisoner. She was with difficulty brought to compose herself. Her counsel\r\navailed himself of the tragical interruption, to close his pleading with\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lords,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cin that piteous cry you heard the eloquence of\r\nmaternal affection, far surpassing the force of my poor words--Rachel\r\nweeping for her children! Nature herself bears testimony in favour of the\r\ntenderness and acuteness of the prisoner\xc3\xads parental feelings. I will not\r\ndishonour her plea by adding a word more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeard ye ever the like o\xc3\xad that, Laird?\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree to Dumbiedikes,\r\nwhen the counsel had ended his speech. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xc3\xads a chield can spin a\r\nmuckle pirn out of a wee tait of tow! Deil haet he kens mair about it\r\nthan what\xc3\xads in the declaration, and a surmise that Jeanie Deans suld hae\r\nbeen able to say something about her sister\xc3\xads situation, whilk surmise,\r\nMr. Crossmyloof says, rests on sma\xc3\xad authority. And he\xc3\xads cleckit this\r\ngreat muckle bird out o\xc3\xad this wee egg! He could wile the very flounders\r\nout o\xc3\xad the Firth.--What garr\xc3\xadd my father no send me to Utrecht?--But\r\nwhisht, the Court is gaun to pronounce the interlocutor of relevancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd accordingly the Judges, after a few words, recorded their judgment,\r\nwhich bore, that the indictment, if proved, was relevant to infer the\r\npains of law: And that the defence, that the panel had communicated her\r\nsituation to her sister, was a relevant defence: And, finally, appointed\r\nthe said indictment and defence to be submitted to the judgment of an\r\nassize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Most righteous judge! a sentence.--Come, prepare.\r\n                                    Merchant of Venice.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means my intention to describe minutely the forms of a\r\nScottish criminal trial, nor am I sure that I could draw up an account so\r\nintelligible and accurate as to abide the criticism of the gentlemen of\r\nthe long robe. It is enough to say that the jury was impanelled, and the\r\ncase proceeded. The prisoner was again required to plead to the charge,\r\nand she again replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNot Guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d in the same heart-thrilling tone as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe crown counsel then called two or three female witnesses, by whose\r\ntestimony it was established, that Effie\xc3\xads situation had been remarked by\r\nthem, that they had taxed her with the fact, and that her answers had\r\namounted to an angry and petulant denial of what they charged her with.\r\nBut, as very frequently happens, the declaration of the panel or accused\r\nparty herself was the evidence which bore hardest upon her case.\r\n\r\nIn the event of these tales ever finding their way across the Border, it\r\nmay be proper to apprise the southern reader that it is the practice in\r\nScotland, on apprehending a suspected person, to subject him to a\r\njudicial examination before a magistrate. He is not compelled to answer\r\nany of the questions asked of him, but may remain silent if he sees it\r\nhis interest to do so. But whatever answers he chooses to give are\r\nformally written down, and being subscribed by himself and the\r\nmagistrate, are produced against the accused in case of his being brought\r\nto trial. It is true, that these declarations are not produced as being\r\nin themselves evidence properly so called, but only as adminicles of\r\ntestimony, tending to corroborate what is considered as legal and proper\r\nevidence. Notwithstanding this nice distinction, however, introduced by\r\nlawyers to reconcile this procedure to their own general rule, that a man\r\ncannot be required to bear witness against himself, it nevertheless\r\nusually happens that these declarations become the means of condemning\r\nthe accused, as it were, out of their own mouths. The prisoner, upon\r\nthese previous examinations, has indeed the privilege of remaining silent\r\nif he pleases; but every man necessarily feels that a refusal to answer\r\nnatural and pertinent interrogatories, put by judicial authority, is in\r\nitself a strong proof of guilt, and will certainly lead to his being\r\ncommitted to prison; and few can renounce the hope of obtaining liberty\r\nby giving some specious account of themselves, and showing apparent\r\nfrankness in explaining their motives and accounting for their conduct.\r\nIt, therefore, seldom happens that the prisoner refuses to give a\r\njudicial declaration, in which, nevertheless, either by letting out too\r\nmuch of the truth, or by endeavouring to substitute a fictitious story,\r\nhe almost always exposes himself to suspicion and to contradictions,\r\nwhich weigh heavily in the minds of the jury.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of Effie Deans was uttered on other principles, and the\r\nfollowing is a sketch of its contents, given in the judicial form, in\r\nwhich they may still be found in the Books of Adjournal.\r\n\r\nThe declarant admitted a criminal intrigue with an individual whose name\r\nshe desired to conceal. \xe2\x80\x9cBeing interrogated, what her reason was for\r\nsecrecy on this point? She declared, that she had no right to blame that\r\nperson\xc3\xads conduct more than she did her own, and that she was willing to\r\nconfess her own faults, but not to say anything which might criminate the\r\nabsent. Interrogated, if she confessed her situation to any one, or made\r\nany preparation for her confinement? Declares, she did not. And being\r\ninterrogated, why she forbore to take steps which her situation so\r\nperemptorily required? Declares, she was ashamed to tell her friends, and\r\nshe trusted the person she has mentioned would provide for her and the\r\ninfant. Interrogated if he did so? Declares, that he did not do so\r\npersonally; but that it was not his fault, for that the declarant is\r\nconvinced he would have laid down his life sooner than the bairn or she\r\nhad come to harm. Interrogated, what prevented him from keeping his\r\npromise? Declares, that it was impossible for him to do so, he being\r\nunder trouble at the time, and declines farther answer to this question.\r\nInterrogated, where she was from the period she left her master, Mr.\r\nSaddletree\xc3\xads family, until her appearance at her father\xc3\xads, at St.\r\nLeonard\xc3\xads, the day before she was apprehended? Declares, she does not\r\nremember. And, on the interrogatory being repeated, declares, she does\r\nnot mind muckle about it, for she was very ill. On the question being\r\nagain repeated, she declares, she will tell the truth, if it should be\r\nthe undoing of her, so long as she is not asked to tell on other folk;\r\nand admits, that she passed that interval of time in the lodging of a\r\nwoman, an acquaintance of that person who had wished her to that place to\r\nbe delivered, and that she was there delivered accordingly of a male\r\nchild. Interrogated, what was the name of that person? Declares and\r\nrefuses to answer this question. Interrogated, where she lives? Declares,\r\nshe has no certainty, for that she was taken to the lodging aforesaid\r\nunder cloud of night. Interrogated, if the lodging was in the city or\r\nsuburbs? Declares and refuses to answer that question. Interrogated,\r\nwhether, when she left the house of Mr. Saddletree, she went up or down\r\nthe street? Declares and refuses to answer the question. Interrogated,\r\nwhether she had ever seen the woman before she was wished to her, as she\r\ntermed it, by the person whose name she refuses to answer? Declares and\r\nreplies, not to her knowledge. Interrogated, whether this woman was\r\nintroduced to her by the said person verbally, or by word of mouth?\r\nDeclares, she has no freedom to answer this question. Interrogated, if\r\nthe child was alive when it was born? Declares, that--God help her and\r\nit!--it certainly was alive. Interrogated, if it died a natural death\r\nafter birth? Declares, not to her knowledge. Interrogated, where it now\r\nis? Declares, she would give her right hand to ken, but that she never\r\nhopes to see mair than the banes of it. And being interrogated, why she\r\nsupposes it is now dead? the declarant wept bitterly and made no answer.\r\nInterrogated, if the woman, in whose lodging she was, seemed to be a fit\r\nperson to be with her in that situation? Declares, she might be fit\r\nenough for skill, but that she was an hard-hearted bad woman.\r\nInterrogated, if there was any other person in the lodging excepting\r\nthemselves two? Declares, that she thinks there was another woman; but\r\nher head was so carried with pain of body and trouble of mind, that she\r\nminded her very little. Interrogated, when the child was taken away from\r\nher? Declared that she fell in a fever, and was light-headed, and when\r\nshe came to her own mind, the woman told her the bairn was dead; and that\r\nthe declarant answered, if it was dead it had had foul play. That,\r\nthereupon, the woman was very sair on her, and gave her much ill\r\nlanguage; and that the deponent was frightened, and crawled out of the\r\nhouse when her back was turned, and went home to Saint Leonard\xc3\xads Crags,\r\nas well as a woman in her condition dought.*\r\n\r\n* i.e. Was able to do.\r\n\r\nInterrogated, why she did not tell her story to her sister and father,\r\nand get force to search the house for her child, dead or alive? Declares,\r\nit was her purpose to do so, but she had not time. Interrogated, why she\r\nnow conceals the name of the woman, and the place of her abode? The\r\ndeclarant remained silent for a time, and then said, that to do so could\r\nnot repair the skaith that was done, but might be the occasion of more.\r\nInterrogated, whether she had herself, at any time, had any purpose of\r\nputting away the child by violence? Declares, never; so might God be\r\nmerciful to her--and then again declares, never, when she was in her\r\nperfect senses; but what bad thoughts the Enemy might put into her brain\r\nwhen she was out of herself, she cannot answer. And again solemnly\r\ninterrogated, declares, that she would have been drawn with wild horses,\r\nrather than have touched the bairn with an unmotherly hand. Interrogated,\r\ndeclares, that among the ill-language the woman gave her, she did say\r\nsure enough that the declarant had hurt the bairn when she was in the\r\nbrain fever; but that the declarant does not believe that she said this\r\nfrom any other cause than to frighten her, and make her be silent.\r\nInterrogated, what else the woman said to her? Declares, that when the\r\ndeclarant cried loud for her bairn, and was like to raise the neighbours,\r\nthe woman threatened her, that they that could stop the wean\xc3\xads skirling\r\nwould stop hers, if she did not keep a\xc3\xad the founder.*\r\n\r\n* i.e. The quieter.\r\n\r\nAnd that this threat, with the manner of the woman, made the declarant\r\nconclude, that the bairn\xc3\xads life was gone, and her own in danger, for that\r\nthe woman was a desperate bad woman, as the declarant judged from the\r\nlanguage she used. Interrogated, declares, that the fever and delirium\r\nwere brought on her by hearing bad news, suddenly told to her, but\r\nrefuses to say what the said news related to. Interrogated, why she does\r\nnot now communicate these particulars, which might, perhaps, enable the\r\nmagistrate to ascertain whether the child is living or dead; and\r\nrequested to observe, that her refusing to do so, exposes her own life,\r\nand leaves the child in bad hands; as also that her present refusal to\r\nanswer on such points is inconsistent with her alleged intention to make\r\na clean breast to her sister? Declares, that she kens the bairn is now\r\ndead, or, if living, there is one that will look after it; that for her\r\nown living or dying, she is in God\xc3\xads hands, who knows her innocence of\r\nharming her bairn with her will or knowledge; and that she has altered\r\nher resolution of speaking out, which she entertained when she left the\r\nwoman\xc3\xads lodging, on account of a matter which she has since learned. And\r\ndeclares, in general, that she is wearied, and will answer no more\r\nquestions at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon a subsequent examination, Euphemia Deans adhered to the declaration\r\nshe had formerly made, with this addition, that a paper found in her\r\ntrunk being shown to her, she admitted that it contained the credentials,\r\nin consequence of which she resigned herself to the conduct of the woman\r\nat whose lodgings she was delivered of the child. Its tenor ran thus:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Effie,--I have gotten the means to send to you by a woman who is\r\nwell qualified to assist you in your approaching streight; she is not\r\nwhat I could wish her, but I cannot do better for you in my present\r\ncondition. I am obliged to trust to her in this present calamity, for\r\nmyself and you too. I hope for the best, though I am now in a sore pinch;\r\nyet thought is free--I think Handie Dandie and I may queer the stifler*\r\nfor all that is come and gone.\r\n\r\n* Avoid the gallows.\r\n\r\nYou will be angry for me writing this to my little Cameronian Lily; but\r\nif I can but live to be a comfort to you, and a father to your babie, you\r\nwill have plenty of time to scold.--Once more, let none knew your\r\ncounsel--my life depends on this hag, d--n her--she is both deep and\r\ndangerous, but she has more wiles and wit than ever were in a beldam\xc3\xads\r\nhead, and has cause to be true to me. Farewell, my Lily--Do not droop on\r\nmy account--in a week I will be yours or no more my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen followed a postscript. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they must truss me, I will repent of\r\nnothing so much, even at the last hard pinch, as of the injury I have\r\ndone my Lily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEffie refused to say from whom she had received this letter, but enough\r\nof the story was now known, to ascertain that it came from Robertson; and\r\nfrom the date, it appeared to have been written about the time when\r\nAndrew Wilson (called for a nickname Handie Dandie) and he were\r\nmeditating their first abortive attempt to escape, which miscarried in\r\nthe manner mentioned in the beginning of this history.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the Crown being concluded, the counsel for the prisoner\r\nbegan to lead a proof in her defence. The first witnesses were examined\r\nupon the girl\xc3\xads character. All gave her an excellent one, but none with\r\nmore feeling than worthy Mrs. Saddletree, who, with the tears on her\r\ncheeks, declared, that she could not have had a higher opinion of Effie\r\nDeans, nor a more sincere regard for her, if she had been her own\r\ndaughter. All present gave the honest woman credit for her goodness of\r\nheart, excepting her husband, who whispered to Dumbiedikes, \xe2\x80\x9cThat Nichil\r\nNovit of yours is but a raw hand at leading evidence, I\xc3\xadm thinking. What\r\nsignified his bringing a woman here to snotter and snivel, and bather\r\ntheir Lordships? He should hae ceeted me, sir, and I should hae gien them\r\nsic a screed o\xc3\xad testimony, they shauldna hae touched a hair o\xc3\xad her head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadna ye better get up and tryt yet?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Laird. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll mak a sign\r\nto Novit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cthank ye for naething, neighbour--that would\r\nbe ultroneous evidence, and I ken what belangs to that; but Nichil Novit\r\nsuld hae had me ceeted _debito tempore._\xe2\x80\x9d And wiping his mouth with his\r\nsilk handkerchief with great importance, he resumed the port and manner\r\nof an edified and intelligent auditor.\r\n\r\nMr. Fairbrother now premised, in a few words, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he meant to bring\r\nforward his most important witness, upon whose evidence the cause must in\r\na great measure depend. What his client was, they had learned from the\r\npreceding witnesses; and so far as general character, given in the most\r\nforcible terms, and even with tears, could interest every one in her\r\nfate, she had already gained that advantage. It was necessary, he\r\nadmitted, that he should produce more positive testimony of her innocence\r\nthan what arose out of general character, and this he undertook to do by\r\nthe mouth of the person to whom she had communicated her situation--by\r\nthe mouth of her natural counsellor and guardian--her sister.--Macer,\r\ncall into court, Jean, or Jeanie Deans, daughter of David Deans,\r\ncowfeeder, at Saint Leonard\xc3\xads Crags!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he uttered these words, the poor prisoner instantly started up, and\r\nstretched herself half-way over the bar, towards the side at which her\r\nsister was to enter. And when, slowly following the officer, the witness\r\nadvanced to the foot of the table, Effie, with the whole expression of\r\nher countenance altered, from that of confused shame and dismay, to an\r\neager, imploring, and almost ecstatic earnestness of entreaty, with\r\noutstretched hands, hair streaming back, eyes raised eagerly to her\r\nsister\xc3\xads face, and glistening through tears, exclaimed in a tone which\r\nwent through the heart of all who heard her,--\xe2\x80\x9cO Jeanie, Jeanie, save me,\r\nsave me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a different feeling, yet equally appropriated to his proud and\r\nself-dependent character, old Deans drew himself back still farther under\r\nthe cover of the bench; so that when Jeanie, as she entered the court,\r\ncast a timid glance towards the place at which she had left him seated,\r\nhis venerable figure was no longer visible. He sate down on the other\r\nside of Dumbiedikes, wrung his hand hard, and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Laird, this\r\nis warst of a\xc3\xad--if I can but win ower this part--I feel my head unco\r\ndizzy; but my Master is strong in his servant\xc3\xads weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d After a\r\nmoment\xc3\xads mental prayer, he again started up, as if impatient of\r\ncontinuing in any one posture, and gradually edged himself forward\r\ntowards the place he had just quitted.\r\n\r\nJeanie in the meantime had advanced to the bottom of the table, when,\r\nunable to resist the impulse of affections she suddenly extended her hand\r\nto her sister. Effie was just within the distance that she could seize it\r\nwith both hers, press it to her mouth, cover it with kisses, and bathe it\r\nin tears, with the fond devotion that a Catholic would pay to a guardian\r\nsaint descended for his safety; while Jeanie, hiding her own face with\r\nher other hand, wept bitterly. The sight would have moved a heart of\r\nstone, much more of flesh and blood. Many of the spectators shed tears,\r\nand it was some time before the presiding Judge himself could so far\r\nsubdue his emotion as to request the witness to compose herself, and the\r\nprisoner to forbear those marks of eager affection, which, however\r\nnatural, could not be permitted at that time, and in that presence.\r\n\r\nThe solemn oath,--\xe2\x80\x9cthe truth to tell, and no truth to conceal, as far as\r\nshe knew or should be asked,\xe2\x80\x9d was then administered by the Judge \xe2\x80\x9cin the\r\nname of God, and as the witness should answer to God at the great day of\r\njudgment;\xe2\x80\x9d an awful adjuration, which seldom fails to make impression\r\neven on the most hardened characters, and to strike with fear even the\r\nmost upright. Jeanie, educated in deep and devout reverence for the name\r\nand attributes of the Deity, was, by the solemnity of a direct appeal to\r\nhis person and justice, awed, but at the same time elevated above all\r\nconsiderations, save those which she could, with a clear conscience, call\r\nHim to witness. She repeated the form in a low and reverent, but distinct\r\ntone of voice, after the Judge, to whom, and not to any inferior officer\r\nof the Court, the task is assigned in Scotland of directing the witness\r\nin that solemn appeal which is the sanction of his testimony.\r\n\r\nWhen the Judge had finished the established form, he added in a feeling,\r\nbut yet a monitory tone, an advice, which the circumstances appeared to\r\nhim to call for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung woman,\xe2\x80\x9d these were his words, \xe2\x80\x9cyou come before this Court in\r\ncircumstances, which it would be worse than cruel not to pity and to\r\nsympathise with. Yet it is my duty to tell you, that the truth, whatever\r\nits consequences may be, the truth is what you owe to your country, and\r\nto that God whose word is truth, and whose name you have now invoked. Use\r\nyour own time in answering the questions that gentleman\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to the\r\ncounsel) \xe2\x80\x9cshall put to you.--But remember, that what you may be tempted\r\nto say beyond what is the actual truth, you must answer both here and\r\nhereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe usual questions were then put to her:--Whether any one had instructed\r\nher what evidence she had to deliver? Whether any one had given or\r\npromised her any good deed, hire, or reward, for her testimony? Whether\r\nshe had any malice or ill-will at his Majesty\xc3\xads Advocate, being the party\r\nagainst whom she was cited as a witness? To which questions she\r\nsuccessively answered by a quiet negative. But their tenor gave great\r\nscandal and offence to her father, who was not aware that they are put to\r\nevery witness as a matter of form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, loud enough to be heard, \xe2\x80\x9cmy bairn is no like the\r\nWidow of Tekoah--nae man has putten words into her mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the judges, better acquainted, perhaps, with the Books of\r\nAdjournal than with the Book of Samuel, was disposed to make some instant\r\ninquiry after this Widow of Tekoah, who, as he construed the matter, had\r\nbeen tampering with the evidence. But the presiding Judge, better versed\r\nin Scripture history, whispered to his learned brother the necessary\r\nexplanation; and the pause occasioned by this mistake had the good effect\r\nof giving Jeanie Deans time to collect her spirits for the painful task\r\nshe had to perform.\r\n\r\nFairbrother, whose practice and intelligence were considerable, saw the\r\nnecessity of letting the witness compose herself. In his heart he\r\nsuspected that she came to bear false witness in her sister\xc3\xads cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is her own affair,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Fairbrother; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is my business\r\nto see that she has plenty of time to regain composure, and to deliver\r\nher evidence, be it true, or be it false--_valeat quantum._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he commenced his interrogatories with uninteresting\r\nquestions, which admitted of instant reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are, I think, the sister of the prisoner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the full sister, however?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir--we are by different mothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; and you are, I think, several years older than your sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nAfter the advocate had conceived that, by these preliminary and\r\nunimportant questions, he had familiarised the witness with the situation\r\nin which she stood, he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether she had not remarked her sister\xc3\xads\r\nstate of health to be altered, during the latter part of the term when\r\nshe had lived with Mrs. Saddletree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she told you the cause of it, my dear, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairbrother,\r\nin an easy, and, as one may say, an inductive sort of tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to interrupt my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Crown Counsel, rising;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I am in your Lordships\xc3\xad judgment, whether this be not a leading\r\nquestion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this point is to be debated,\xe2\x80\x9d said the presiding Judge, \xe2\x80\x9cthe witness\r\nmust be removed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the Scottish lawyers regard with a sacred and scrupulous horror every\r\nquestion so shaped by the counsel examining, as to convey to a witness\r\nthe least intimation of the nature of the answer which is desired from\r\nhim. These scruples, though founded on an excellent principle, are\r\nsometimes carried to an absurd pitch of nicety, especially as it is\r\ngenerally easy for a lawyer who has his wits about him to elude the\r\nobjection. Fairbrother did so in the present case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not necessary to waste the time of the Court, my Lord since the\r\nKing\xc3\xads Counsel thinks it worth while to object to the form of my\r\nquestion, I will shape it otherwise.--Pray, young woman, did you ask your\r\nsister any question when you observed her looking unwell?--take\r\ncourage--speak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked her,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat ailed her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well--take your own time--and what was the answer she made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n continued Mr. Fairbrother.\r\n\r\nJeanie was silent, and looked deadly pale. It was not that she at any one\r\ninstant entertained an idea of the possibility of prevarication--it was\r\nthe natural hesitation to extinguish the last spark of hope that remained\r\nfor her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake courage, young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fairbrother.--\xe2\x80\x9cI asked what your sister\r\nsaid ailed her when you inquired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie, with a faint voice, which was yet heard\r\ndistinctly in the most distant corner of the Court-room,--such an awful\r\nand profound silence had been preserved during the anxious interval,\r\nwhich had interposed betwixt the lawyer\xc3\xads question and the answer of the\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nFairbrother\xc3\xads countenance fell; but with that ready presence of mind,\r\nwhich is as useful in civil as in military emergencies, he immediately\r\nrallied.--\xe2\x80\x9cNothing? True; you mean nothing at _first_--but when you asked\r\nher again, did she not tell you what ailed her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was put in a tone meant to make her comprehend the\r\nimportance of her answer, had she not been already aware of it. The\r\nice was broken, however, and with less pause than at first, she now\r\nreplied,--\xe2\x80\x9cAlack! alack! she never breathed word to me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep groan passed through the Court. It was echoed by one deeper and\r\nmore agonised from the unfortunate father. The hope to which\r\nunconsciously, and in spite of himself, he had still secretly clung, had\r\nnow dissolved, and the venerable old man fell forward senseless on the\r\nfloor of the Court-house, with his head at the foot of his terrified\r\ndaughter. The unfortunate prisoner, with impotent passion, strove with\r\nthe guards betwixt whom she was placed. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me gang to my father!--I\r\n_will_ gang to him--I _will_ gang to him--he is dead--he is killed--I hae\r\nkilled him!\xe2\x80\x9d--she repeated, in frenzied tones of grief, which those who\r\nheard them did not speedily forget.\r\n\r\nEven in this moment of agony and general confusion, Jeanie did not lose\r\nthat superiority, which a deep and firm mind assures to its possessor\r\nunder the most trying circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my father--he is our father,\xe2\x80\x9d she mildly repeated to those who\r\nendeavoured to separate them, as she stooped,--shaded aside his grey\r\nhairs, and began assiduously to chafe his temples.\r\n\r\nThe Judge, after repeatedly wiping his eyes, gave directions that they\r\nshould be conducted into a neighbouring apartment, and carefully\r\nattended. The prisoner, as her father was borne from the Court, and her\r\nsister slowly followed, pursued them with her eyes so earnestly fixed, as\r\nif they would have started from their sockets. But when they were no\r\nlonger visible, she seemed to find, in her despairing and deserted state,\r\na courage which she had not yet exhibited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bitterness of it is now past,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and then boldly, addressed\r\nthe Court. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lords, if it is your pleasure to gang on wi\xc3\xad this matter,\r\nthe weariest day will hae its end at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Judge, who, much to his honour, had shared deeply in the general\r\nsympathy, was surprised at being recalled to his duty by the prisoner. He\r\ncollected himself, and requested to know if the panel\xc3\xads counsel had more\r\nevidence to produce. Fairbrother replied, with an air of dejection, that\r\nhis proof was concluded.\r\n\r\nThe King\xc3\xads Counsel addressed the jury for the crown. He said in a few\r\nwords, that no one could be more concerned than he was for the\r\ndistressing scene which they had just witnessed. But it was the necessary\r\nconsequence of great crimes to bring distress and ruin upon all connected\r\nwith the perpetrators. He briefly reviewed the proof, in which he showed\r\nthat all the circumstances of the case concurred with those required by\r\nthe act under which the unfortunate prisoner was tried: That the counsel\r\nfor the panel had totally failed in proving, that Euphemia Deans had\r\ncommunicated her situation to her sister: That, respecting her previous\r\ngood character, he was sorry to observe, that it was females who\r\npossessed the world\xc3\xads good report, and to whom it was justly valuable,\r\nwho were most strongly tempted, by shame and fear of the world\xc3\xads censure,\r\nto the crime of infanticide: That the child was murdered, he professed to\r\nentertain no doubt. The vacillating and inconsistent declaration of the\r\nprisoner herself, marked as it was by numerous refusals to speak the\r\ntruth on subjects, when, according to her own story, it would have been\r\nnatural, as well as advantageous, to have been candid; even this\r\nimperfect declaration left no doubt in his mind as to the fate of the\r\nunhappy infant. Neither could he doubt that the panel was a partner in\r\nthis guilt. Who else had an interest in a deed so inhuman? Surely neither\r\nRobertson, nor Robertson\xc3\xads agent, in whose house she was delivered,\r\nhad the least temptation to commit such a crime, unless upon her account,\r\nwith her connivance, and for the sake of saying her reputation. But it\r\nwas not required of him, by the law, that he should bring precise proof\r\nof the murder, or of the prisoner\xc3\xads accession to it. It was the very\r\npurpose of the statute to substitute a certain chain of presumptive\r\nevidence in place of a probation, which, in such cases, it was peculiarly\r\ndifficult to obtain. The jury might peruse the statute itself, and they\r\nhad also the libel and interlocutor of relevancy to direct them in point\r\nof law. He put it to the conscience of the jury, that under both he was\r\nentitled to a verdict of Guilty.\r\n\r\nThe charge of Fairbrother was much cramped by his having failed in the\r\nproof which he expected to lead. But he fought his losing cause with\r\ncourage and constancy. He ventured to arraign the severity of the statute\r\nunder which the young woman was tried. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all other cases,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe first thing required of the criminal prosecutor was to prove\r\nunequivocally that the crime libelled had actually been committed, which\r\nlawyers called proving the _corpus delicti._ But this statute, made\r\ndoubtless with the best intentions, and under the impulse of a just\r\nhorror for the unnatural crime of infanticide, ran the risk of itself\r\noccasioning the worst of murders, the death of an innocent person, to\r\natone for a supposed crime which may never have been committed by anyone.\r\nHe was so far from acknowledging the alleged probability of the child\xc3\xads\r\nviolent death, that he could not even allow that there was evidence of\r\nits having ever lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe King\xc3\xads Counsel pointed to the woman\xc3\xads declaration; to which the\r\ncounsel replied--\xe2\x80\x9cA production concocted in a moment of terror and agony,\r\nand which approached to insanity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chis learned brother well\r\nknew was no sound evidence against the party who emitted it. It was true,\r\nthat a judicial confession, in presence of the Justices themselves, was\r\nthe strongest of all proof, insomuch that it is said in law, that \xc3\xab_in\r\nconfitentem nullae sunt partes judicis._\xc3\xad But this was true of judicial\r\nconfession only, by which law meant that which is made in presence of the\r\njustices, and the sworn inquest. Of extrajudicial confession, all\r\nauthorities held with the illustrious Farinaceus and Matthaeus,\r\n\xc3\xab_confessio extrajudicialis in se nulla est; et quod nullum est, non\r\npotest adminiculari._\xc3\xad It was totally inept, and void of all strength and\r\neffect from the beginning; incapable, therefore, of being bolstered up or\r\nsupported, or, according to the law phrase, adminiculated, by other\r\npresumptive circumstances. In the present case, therefore, letting the\r\nextrajudicial confession go, as it ought to go, for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontended, \xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecutor had not made out the second quality of the\r\nstatute, that a live child had been born; and _that,_ at least, ought to\r\nbe established before presumptions were received that it had been\r\nmurdered. If any of the assize,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cshould be of opinion that this\r\nwas dealing rather narrowly with the statute, they ought to consider that\r\nit was in its nature highly penal, and therefore entitled to no\r\nfavourable construction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe concluded a learned speech, with an eloquent peroration on the scene\r\nthey had just witnessed, during which Saddletree fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was now the presiding Judge\xc3\xads turn to address the jury. He did so\r\nbriefly and distinctly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was for the jury,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto consider whether the prosecutor had\r\nmade out his plea. For himself, he sincerely grieved to say, that a\r\nshadow of doubt remained not upon his mind concerning the verdict which\r\nthe inquest had to bring in. He would not follow the prisoner\xc3\xads counsel\r\nthrough the impeachment which he had brought against the statute of King\r\nWilliam and Queen Mary. He and the jury were sworn to judge according to\r\nthe laws as they stood, not to criticise, or evade, or even to justify\r\nthem. In no civil case would a counsel have been permitted to plead his\r\nclient\xc3\xads case in the teeth of the law; but in the hard situation in which\r\ncounsel were often placed in the Criminal Court, as well as out of favour\r\nto all presumptions of innocence, he had not inclined to interrupt the\r\nlearned gentleman, or narrow his plea. The present law, as it now stood,\r\nhad been instituted by the wisdom of their fathers, to check the alarming\r\nprogress of a dreadful crime; when it was found too severe for its\r\npurpose it would doubtless be altered by the wisdom of the Legislature;\r\nat present it was the law of the land, the rule of the Court, and,\r\naccording to the oath which they had taken, it must be that of the jury.\r\nThis unhappy girl\xc3\xads situation could not be doubted; that she had borne a\r\nchild, and that the child had disappeared, were certain facts. The\r\nlearned counsel had failed to show that she had communicated her\r\nsituation. All the requisites of the case required by the statute were\r\ntherefore before the jury. The learned gentleman had, indeed, desired\r\nthem to throw out of consideration the panel\xc3\xads own confession, which was\r\nthe plea usually urged, in penury of all others, by counsel in his\r\nsituation, who usually felt that the declarations of their clients bore\r\nhard on them. But that the Scottish law designed that a certain weight\r\nshould be laid on these declarations, which, he admitted, were\r\n_quodammodo_ extrajudicial, was evident from the universal practice by\r\nwhich they were always produced and read, as part of the prosecutor\xc3\xads\r\nprobation. In the present case, no person who had heard the witnesses\r\ndescribe the appearance of the young woman before she left Saddletree\xc3\xads\r\nhouse, and contrasted it with that of her state and condition at her\r\nreturn to her father\xc3\xads, could have any doubt that the fact of delivery\r\nhad taken place, as set forth in her own declaration, which was,\r\ntherefore, not a solitary piece of testimony, but adminiculated and\r\nsupported by the strongest circumstantial proof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cstate the impression upon his own mind with the\r\npurpose of biassing theirs. He had felt no less than they had done from\r\nthe scene of domestic misery which had been exhibited before them; and if\r\nthey, having God and a good conscience, the sanctity of their oath, and\r\nthe regard due to the law of the country, before their eyes, could come\r\nto a conclusion favourable to this unhappy prisoner, he should rejoice as\r\nmuch as anyone in Court; for never had he found his duty more distressing\r\nthan in discharging it that day, and glad he would be to be relieved from\r\nthe still more painful task which would otherwise remain for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jury, having heard the Judge\xc3\xads address, bowed and retired, preceded\r\nby a macer of Court, to the apartment destined for their deliberation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Law, take thy victim--May she find the mercy\r\n             In yon mild heaven, which this hard world denies her!\r\n\r\nIt was an hour ere the jurors returned, and as they traversed the crowd\r\nwith slow steps, as men about to discharge themselves of a heavy and\r\npainful responsibility, the audience was hushed into profound, earnest,\r\nand awful silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you agreed on your chancellor, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d was the first question\r\nof the Judge.\r\n\r\nThe foreman, called in Scotland the chancellor of the jury, usually the\r\nman of best rank and estimation among the assizers, stepped forward, and\r\nwith a low reverence, delivered to the Court a sealed paper, containing\r\nthe verdict, which, until of late years, that verbal returns are in some\r\ninstances permitted, was always couched in writing. The jury remained\r\nstanding while the Judge broke the seals, and having perused the paper,\r\nhanded it with an air of mournful gravity down to the clerk of Court, who\r\nproceeded to engross in the record the yet unknown verdict, of which,\r\nhowever, all omened the tragical contents. A form still remained,\r\ntrifling and unimportant in itself, but to which imagination adds a sort\r\nof solemnity, from the awful occasion upon which it is used. A lighted\r\ncandle was placed on the table, the original paper containing the verdict\r\nwas enclosed in a sheet of paper, and, sealed with the Judge\xc3\xads own\r\nsignet, was transmitted to the Crown Office, to be preserved among other\r\nrecords of the same kind. As all this is transacted in profound silence,\r\nthe producing and extinguishing the candle seems a type of the human\r\nspark which is shortly afterwards doomed to be quenched, and excites in\r\nthe spectators something of the same effect which in England is obtained\r\nby the Judge assuming the fatal cap of judgment. When these preliminary\r\nforms had been gone through, the Judge required Euphemia Deans to attend\r\nto the verdict to be read.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual words of style, the verdict set forth, that the Jury\r\nhaving made choice of John Kirk, Esq., to be their chancellor, and Thomas\r\nMoore, merchant, to be their clerk, did, by a plurality of voices, find\r\nthe said Euphemia Deans Guilty of the crime libelled; but, in\r\nconsideration of her extreme youth, and the cruel circumstances of her\r\ncase, did earnestly entreat that the Judge would recommend her to the\r\nmercy of the Crown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Judge, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have done your duty--and a painful one\r\nit must have been to men of humanity like you. I will undoubtedly\r\ntransmit your recommendation to the throne. But it is my duty to tell all\r\nwho now hear me, but especially to inform that unhappy young woman, in\r\norder that her mind may be settled accordingly, that I have not the least\r\nhope of a pardon being granted in the present case. You know the crime\r\nhas been increasing in this land, and I know farther, that this has been\r\nascribed to the lenity in which the laws have been exercised, and that\r\nthere is therefore no hope whatever of obtaining a remission for this\r\noffence.\xe2\x80\x9d The jury bowed again, and, released from their painful office,\r\ndispersed themselves among the mass of bystanders.\r\n\r\nThe Court then asked Mr. Fairbrother whether he had anything to say, why\r\njudgment should not follow on the verdict? The counsel had spent some\r\ntime in persuing and reperusing the verdict, counting the letters in each\r\njuror\xc3\xads name, and weighing every phrase, nay, every syllable, in the\r\nnicest scales of legal criticism. But the clerk of the jury had\r\nunderstood his business too well. No flaw was to be found, and\r\nFairbrother mournfully intimated, that he had nothing to say in arrest of\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe presiding Judge then addressed the unhappy prisoner:--\xe2\x80\x9cEuphemia\r\nDeans, attend to the sentence of the Court now to be pronounced against\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose from her seat, and with a composure far greater than could have\r\nbeen augured from her demeanour during some parts of the trial, abode the\r\nconclusion of the awful scene. So nearly does the mental portion of our\r\nfeelings resemble those which are corporeal, that the first severe blows\r\nwhich we receive bring with them a stunning apathy, which renders us\r\nindifferent to those that follow them. Thus said Mandrin, when he was\r\nundergoing the punishment of the wheel; and so have all felt, upon whom\r\nsuccessive inflictions have descended with continuous and reiterated\r\nviolence.*\r\n\r\n* [The notorious Mandrin was known as the Captain-General of French &\r\nsmugglers. See a Tract on his exploits, printed 1753.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Judge, \xe2\x80\x9cit is my painful duty to tell you, that\r\nyour life is forfeited under a law, which, if it may seem in some degree\r\nsevere, is yet wisely so, to render those of your unhappy situation aware\r\nwhat risk they run, by concealing, out of pride or false shame, their\r\nlapse from virtue, and making no preparation to save the lives of the\r\nunfortunate infants whom they are to bring into the world. When you\r\nconcealed your situation from your mistress, your sister, and other\r\nworthy and compassionate persons of your own sex, in whose favour your\r\nformer conduct had given you a fair place, you seem to me to have had in\r\nyour contemplation, at least, the death of the helpless creature, for\r\nwhose life you neglected to provide. How the child was disposed\r\nof--whether it was dealt upon by another, or by yourself--whether the\r\nextraordinary story you have told is partly false, or altogether so, is\r\nbetween God and your own conscience. I will not aggravate your distress\r\nby pressing on that topic, but I do most solemnly adjure you to employ\r\nthe remaining space of your time in making your peace with God, for which\r\npurpose such reverend clergymen, as you yourself may name, shall have\r\naccess to you. Notwithstanding the humane recommendation of the jury, I\r\ncannot afford to you, in the present circumstances of the country, the\r\nslightest hope that your life will be prolonged beyond the period\r\nassigned for the execution of your sentence. Forsaking, therefore, the\r\nthoughts of this world, let your mind be prepared by repentance for those\r\nof more awful moments--for death, judgment, and eternity.--Doomster, read\r\nthe sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* Note N. Doomster, or Dempster, of Court.\r\n\r\nWhen the Doomster showed himself, a tall haggard figure, arrayed in a\r\nfantastic garment of black and grey, passmented with silver lace, all\r\nfell back with a sort of instinctive horror, and made wide way for him to\r\napproach the foot of the table. As this office was held by the common\r\nexecutioner, men shouldered each other backward to avoid even the touch\r\nof his garment, and some were seen to brush their own clothes, which had\r\naccidentally become subject to such contamination. A sound went through\r\nthe Court, produced by each person drawing in their breath hard, as men\r\ndo when they expect or witness what is frightful, and at the same time\r\naffecting. The caitiff villain yet seemed, amid his hardened brutality,\r\nto have some sense of his being the object of public detestation, which\r\nmade him impatient of being in public, as birds of evil omen are anxious\r\nto escape from daylight, and from pure air.\r\n\r\nRepeating after the Clerk of Court, he gabbled over the words of the\r\nsentence, which condemned Euphemia Deans to be conducted back to the\r\nTolbooth of Edinburgh, and detained there until Wednesday the day of ---;\r\nand upon that day, betwixt the hours of two and four o\xc3\xadclock afternoon,\r\nto be conveyed to the common place of execution, and there hanged by the\r\nneck upon a gibbet. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doomster, aggravating his harsh\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cI pronounce for _doom._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe vanished when he had spoken the last emphatic word, like a foul fiend\r\nafter the purpose of his visitation had been accomplished; but the\r\nimpression of horror excited by his presence and his errand, remained\r\nupon the crowd of spectators.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate criminal,--for so she must now be termed,--with more\r\nsusceptibility, and more irritable feelings than her father and sister,\r\nwas found, in this emergence, to possess a considerable share of their\r\ncourage. She had remained standing motionless at the bar while the\r\nsentence was pronounced, and was observed to shut her eyes when the\r\nDoomster appeared. But she was the first to break silence when that evil\r\nform had left his place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive ye, my Lords,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand dinna be angry wi\xc3\xad me for\r\nwishing it--we a\xc3\xad need forgiveness.--As for myself, I canna blame ye, for\r\nye act up to your lights; and if I havena killed my poor infant, ye may\r\nwitness a\xc3\xad that hae seen it this day, that I hae been the means of\r\nkilling my greyheaded father--I deserve the warst frae man, and frae God\r\ntoo--But God is mair mercifu\xc3\xad to us than we are to each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words the trial concluded. The crowd rushed, bearing forward\r\nand shouldering each other, out of the Court, in the same tumultuary mode\r\nin which they had entered; and, in excitation of animal motion and animal\r\nspirits, soon forgot whatever they had felt as impressive in the scene\r\nwhich they had witnessed. The professional spectators, whom habit and\r\ntheory had rendered as callous to the distress of the scene as medical\r\nmen are to those of a surgical operation, walked homeward in groups,\r\ndiscussing the general principle of the statute under which the young\r\nwoman was condemned, the nature of the evidence, and the arguments of the\r\ncounsel, without considering even that of the Judge as exempt from their\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nThe female spectators, more compassionate, were loud in exclamation\r\nagainst that part of the Judge\xc3\xads speech which seemed to cut off the hope\r\nof pardon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet him up, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Howden, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell us that the poor lassie\r\nbehoved to die, when Mr. John Kirk, as civil a gentleman as is within the\r\nports of the town, took the pains to prigg for her himsell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Damahoy, drawing up her thin maidenly\r\nform to its full height of prim dignity--\xe2\x80\x9cI really think this unnatural\r\nbusiness of having bastard-bairns should be putten a stop to.--There isna\r\na hussy now on this side of thirty that you can bring within your doors,\r\nbut there will be chields--writer-lads, prentice-lads, and what\r\nnot--coming traiking after them for their destruction, and discrediting\r\nane\xc3\xads honest house into the bargain--I hae nae patience wi\xc3\xad them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Howden, \xe2\x80\x9cwe suld live and let live--we hae\r\nbeen young oursells, and we are no aye to judge the warst when lads and\r\nlasses forgather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung oursells! and judge the warst!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Damahoy. \xe2\x80\x9cI am no sae\r\nauld as that comes to, Mrs. Howden; and as for what ye ca\xc3\xad the warst, I\r\nken neither good nor bad about the matter, I thank my stars!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are thankfu\xc3\xad for sma\xc3\xad mercies, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Howden with a toss of\r\nher head; \xe2\x80\x9cand as for you and young--I trow ye were doing for yoursell at\r\nthe last riding of the Scots Parliament, and that was in the gracious\r\nyear seven, sae ye can be nae sic chicken at ony rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlumdamas, who acted as squire of the body to the two contending dames,\r\ninstantly saw the hazard of entering into such delicate points of\r\nchronology, and being a lover of peace and good neighbourhood, lost no\r\ntime in bringing back the conversation to its original subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Judge didna tell us a\xc3\xad he could hae tell\xc3\xadd us, if he had liked,\r\nabout the application for pardon, neighbours,\xe2\x80\x9d said he \xe2\x80\x9cthere is aye a\r\nwimple in a lawyer\xc3\xads clew; but it\xc3\xads a wee bit of a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is\xc3\xadt--what is\xc3\xadt, neighbour Plumdamas?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Howden and\r\nMiss Damahoy at once, the acid fermentation of their dispute being at\r\nonce neutralised by the powerful alkali implied in the word secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xc3\xads Mr. Saddletree can tell ye that better than me, for it was him\r\nthat tauld me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Plumdamas as Saddletree came up, with his wife\r\nhanging on his arm, and looking very disconsolate.\r\n\r\nWhen the question was put to Saddletree, he looked very scornful. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nspeak about stopping the frequency of child-murder,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a\r\ncontemptuous tone; \xe2\x80\x9cdo ye think our auld enemies of England, as Glendook\r\naye ca\xc3\xads them in his printed Statute-book, care a boddle whether we didna\r\nkill ane anither, skin and birn, horse and foot, man, woman, and bairns,\r\nall and sindry, _omnes et singulos,_ as Mr. Crossmyloof says? Na, na,\r\nit\xc3\xads no _that_ hinders them frae pardoning the bit lassie. But here is\r\nthe pinch of the plea. The king and queen are sae ill pleased wi\xc3\xad that\r\nmistak about Porteous, that deil a kindly Scot will they pardon again,\r\neither by reprieve or remission, if the haill town o\xc3\xad Edinburgh should be\r\na\xc3\xad hanged on ae tow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeil that they were back at their German kale-yard then, as my neighbour\r\nMacCroskie ca\xc3\xads it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Howden, \xe2\x80\x9can that\xc3\xads the way they\xc3\xadre gaun to\r\nguide us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say for certain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Damahoy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat King George flang his\r\nperiwig in the fire when he heard o\xc3\xad the Porteous mob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has done that, they say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cfor less thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Damahoy, \xe2\x80\x9che might keep mair wit in his anger--but\r\nit\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad the better for his wigmaker, I\xc3\xadse warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe queen tore her biggonets for perfect anger,--ye\xc3\xadll hae heard o\xc3\xad that\r\ntoo?\xe2\x80\x9d said Plumdamas. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the king, they say, kickit Sir Robert Walpole\r\nfor no keeping down the mob of Edinburgh; but I dinna believe he wad\r\nbehave sae ungenteel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads dooms truth, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree; \xe2\x80\x9cand he was for kickin\xc3\xad the\r\nDuke of Argyle* too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Note O. John Duke of Argyle and Greenwich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKickin\xc3\xad the Duke of Argyle!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the hearers at once, in all the\r\nvarious combined keys of utter astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but MacCallummore\xc3\xads blood wadna sit down wi\xc3\xad that; there was risk of\r\nAndro Ferrara coming in thirdsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe duke is a real Scotsman--a true friend to the country,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nSaddletree\xc3\xads hearers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, troth is he, to king and country baith, as ye sall hear,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nthe orator, \xe2\x80\x9cif ye will come in bye to our house, for it\xc3\xads safest\r\nspeaking of sic things _inter parietes._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they entered his shop, he thrust his prentice boy out of it, and,\r\nunlocking his desk, took out, with an air of grave and complacent\r\nimportance, a dirty and crumpled piece of printed paper; he observed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is new corn--it\xc3\xads no every body could show you the like o\xc3\xad this.\r\nIt\xc3\xads the duke\xc3\xads speech about the Porteous mob, just promulgated by the\r\nhawkers. Ye shall hear what Ian Roy Cean* says for himsell.\r\n\r\n* Red John the warrior, a name personal and proper in the Highlands to\r\nJohn Duke of Argyle and Greenwich, as MacCummin was that of his race or\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nMy correspondent bought it in the Palace-yard, that\xc3\xads like just under the\r\nking\xc3\xads nose--I think he claws up their mittans!--It came in a letter\r\nabout a foolish bill of exchange that the man wanted me to renew for him.\r\nI wish ye wad see about it, Mrs. Saddletree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHonest Mrs. Saddletree had hitherto been so sincerely distressed about\r\nthe situation of her unfortunate prote\xc3\xadge\xc3\xade, that she had suffered her\r\nhusband to proceed in his own way, without attending to what he was\r\nsaying. The words bills and renew had, however, an awakening sound in\r\nthem; and she snatched the letter which her husband held towards her, and\r\nwiping her eyes, and putting on her spectacles, endeavoured, as fast as\r\nthe dew which collected on her glasses would permit, to get at the\r\nmeaning of the needful part of the epistle; while her husband, with\r\npompous elevation, read an extract from the speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no minister, I never was a minister, and I never will be one\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didna ken his Grace was ever designed for the ministry,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\r\nMrs. Howden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe disna mean a minister of the gospel, Mrs. Howden, but a minister of\r\nstate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree, with condescending goodness, and then proceeded:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time was when I might have been a piece of a minister, but I was too\r\nsensible of my own incapacity to engage in any state affair. And I thank\r\nGod that I had always too great a value for those few abilities which\r\nNature has given me, to employ them in doing any drudgery, or any job of\r\nwhat kind soever. I have, ever since I set out in the world (and I\r\nbelieve few have set out more early), served my prince with my tongue; I\r\nhave served him with any little interest I had, and I have served him\r\nwith my sword, and in my profession of arms. I have held employments\r\nwhich I have lost, and were I to be to-morrow deprived of those which\r\nstill remain to me, and which I have endeavoured honestly to deserve, I\r\nwould still serve him to the last acre of my inheritance, and to the last\r\ndrop of my blood--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Saddletree here broke in upon the orator:--\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Saddletree, what\r\n_is_ the meaning of a\xc3\xad this? Here are ye clavering about the Duke of\r\nArgyle, and this man Martingale gaun to break on our hands, and lose us\r\ngude sixty pounds--I wonder what duke will pay that, quotha--I wish the\r\nDuke of Argyle would pay his ain accounts--He is in a thousand punds\r\nScots on thae very books when he was last at Roystoun--I\xc3\xadm no saying but\r\nhe\xc3\xads a just nobleman, and that it\xc3\xads gude siller--but it wad drive ane\r\ndaft to be confused wi\xc3\xad deukes and drakes, and thae distressed folk\r\nup-stairs, that\xc3\xads Jeanie Deans and her father. And then, putting the very\r\ncallant that was sewing the curpel out o\xc3\xad the shop, to play wi\xc3\xad\r\nblackguards in the close--Sit still, neighbours, it\xc3\xads no that I mean to\r\ndisturb _you;_ but what between courts o\xc3\xad law and courts o\xc3\xad state, and\r\nupper and under parliaments, and parliament houses, here and in London,\r\nthe gudeman\xc3\xads gane clean gyte, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gossips understood civility, and the rule of doing as they would be\r\ndone by, too well, to tarry upon the slight invitation implied in the\r\nconclusion of this speech, and therefore made their farewells and\r\ndeparture as fast as possible, Saddletree whispering to Plundamas that he\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x9cmeet him at MacCroskie\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x9d (the low-browed shop in the\r\nLuckenbooths, already mentioned), \xe2\x80\x9cin the hour of cause, and put\r\nMacCallummore\xc3\xads speech in his pocket, for a\xc3\xad the gudewife\xc3\xads din.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Saddletree saw the house freed of her importunate visitors, and\r\nthe little boy reclaimed from the pastimes of the wynd to the exercise of\r\nthe awl, she went to visit her unhappy relative, David Deans, and his\r\nelder daughter, who had found in her house the nearest place of friendly\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Vol. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEART OF MID-LOTHIAN, Volume 2\r\n\r\nBy Walter Scott\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALES OF MY LANDLORD\r\n\r\nCOLLECTED AND ARRANGED\r\n\r\nBY JEDEDIAH CLEISHBOTHAM,\r\n\r\nSCHOOLMASTER AND PARISH CLERK\r\n\r\nOF GANDERCLEUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Titlepage]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEART OF MID-LOTHIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIRST.\r\n\r\n                         Isab.--Alas! what poor ability\xc3\xads in me\r\n                         To do him good?\r\n                         Lucio.--Assay the power you have.\r\n                                              Measure for Measure.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Saddletree entered the apartment in which her guests had\r\nshrouded their misery, she found the window darkened. The feebleness\r\nwhich followed his long swoon had rendered it necessary to lay the old\r\nman in bed. The curtains were drawn around him, and Jeanie sate\r\nmotionless by the side of the bed. Mrs. Saddletree was a woman of\r\nkindness, nay, of feeling, but not of delicacy. She opened the half-shut\r\nwindow, drew aside the curtain, and, taking her kinsman by the hand,\r\nexhorted him to sit up, and bear his sorrow like a good man, and a\r\nChristian man, as he was. But when she quitted his hand, it fell\r\npowerless by his side, nor did he attempt the least reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs all over?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jeanie, with lips and cheeks as pale as ashes,--\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nis there nae hope for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNane, or next to nane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Saddletree; \xe2\x80\x9cI heard the Judge-carle\r\nsay it with my ain ears--It was a burning shame to see sae mony o\xc3\xad them\r\nset up yonder in their red gowns and black gowns, and to take the life o\xc3\xad\r\na bit senseless lassie. I had never muckle broo o\xc3\xad my gudeman\xc3\xads gossips,\r\nand now I like them waur than ever. The only wiselike thing I heard\r\nonybody say, was decent Mr. John Kirk of Kirk-knowe, and he wussed them\r\njust to get the king\xc3\xads mercy, and nae mair about it. But he spake to\r\nunreasonable folk--he might just hae keepit his breath to hae blawn on\r\nhis porridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _can_ the king gie her mercy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cSome folk\r\ntell me he canna gie mercy in cases of mur in cases like hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Can_ he gie mercy, hinny?--I weel I wot he can, when he likes. There\r\nwas young Singlesword, that stickit the Laird of Ballencleuch, and\r\nCaptain Hackum, the Englishman, that killed Lady Colgrain\xc3\xads gudeman, and\r\nthe Master of Saint Clair, that shot the twa Shaws,* and mony mair in my\r\ntime--to be sure they were gentle blood, and had their kin to speak for\r\nthem--And there was Jock Porteous the other day--I\xc3\xadse warrant there\xc3\xads\r\nmercy, an folk could win at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* [In 1828, the Author presented to the Roxburgh Club a curious volume\r\ncontaining the \xe2\x80\x9cProceedings in the Court-Martial held upon John, Master\r\nof Sinclair, for the murder of Ensign Schaw, and Captain Schaw, 17th\r\nOctober 1708.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorteous?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cvery true--I forget a\xc3\xad that I suld maist mind.--\r\nFare ye weel, Mrs. Saddletree; and may ye never want a friend in the\r\nhour of distress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill ye no stay wi\xc3\xad your father, Jeanie, bairn?--Ye had better,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Saddletree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be wanted ower yonder,\xe2\x80\x9d indicating the Tolbooth with her hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I maun leave him now, or I will never be able to leave him. I fearna\r\nfor his life--I ken how strong-hearted he is--I ken it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laying\r\nher hand on her bosom, \xe2\x80\x9cby my ain heart at this minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, hinny, if ye think it\xc3\xads for the best, better he stay here and rest\r\nhim, than gang back to St. Leonard\xc3\xads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuckle better--muckle better--God bless you!--God bless you!--At no rate\r\nlet him gang till ye hear frae me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ye\xc3\xadll be back belive?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Saddletree, detaining her; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nwinna let ye stay yonder, hinny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I maun gang to St. Leonard\xc3\xads--there\xc3\xads muckle to be dune, and little\r\ntime to do it in--And I have friends to speak to--God bless you--take\r\ncare of my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had reached the door of the apartment, when, suddenly turning, she\r\ncame back, and knelt down by the bedside.--\xe2\x80\x9cO father, gie me your\r\nblessing--I dare not go till ye bless me. Say but \xc3\xabGod bless ye, and\r\nprosper ye, Jeanie\xc3\xad--try but to say that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstinctively, rather than by an exertion of intellect, the old man\r\nmurmured a prayer, that \xe2\x80\x9cpurchased and promised blessings might be\r\nmultiplied upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has blessed mine errand,\xe2\x80\x9d said his daughter, rising from her knees,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand it is borne in upon my mind that I shall prosper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she left the room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Saddletree looked after her, and shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish she binna\r\nroving, poor thing--There\xc3\xads something queer about a\xc3\xad thae Deanses. I\r\ndinna like folk to be sae muckle better than other folk--seldom comes\r\ngude o\xc3\xadt. But if she\xc3\xads gaun to look after the kye at St. Leonard\xc3\xads,\r\nthat\xc3\xads another story; to be sure they maun be sorted.--Grizzie, come up\r\nhere, and tak tent to the honest auld man, and see he wants naething.--Ye\r\nsilly tawpie\xe2\x80\x9d (addressing the maid-servant as she entered), \xe2\x80\x9cwhat garr\xc3\xadd\r\nye busk up your cockemony that gate?--I think there\xc3\xads been enough the day\r\nto gie an awfa\xc3\xad warning about your cockups and your fallal duds--see what\r\nthey a\xc3\xad come to,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. etc. etc.\r\n\r\nLeaving the good lady to her lecture upon worldly vanities, we must\r\ntransport our reader to the cell in which the unfortunate Effie Deans was\r\nnow immured, being restricted of several liberties which she had enjoyed\r\nbefore the sentence was pronounced.\r\n\r\nWhen she had remained about an hour in the state of stupified horror so\r\nnatural in her situation, she was disturbed by the opening of the jarring\r\nbolts of her place of confinement, and Ratcliffe showed himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads\r\nyour sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwants to speak t\xc3\xadye, Effie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna see naebody,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, with the hasty irritability which\r\nmisery had rendered more acute--\xe2\x80\x9cI canna see naebody, and least of a\xc3\xad\r\nher--Bid her take care o\xc3\xad the auld man--I am naething to ony o\xc3\xad them now,\r\nnor them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says she maun see ye, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe; and Jeanie, rushing\r\ninto the apartment, threw her arms round her sister\xc3\xads neck, who writhed\r\nto extricate herself from her embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat signifies coming to greet ower me,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Effie, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you have\r\nkilled me?--killed me, when a word of your mouth would have saved\r\nme--killed me, when I am an innocent creature--innocent of that guilt at\r\nleast--and me that wad hae wared body and soul to save your finger from\r\nbeing hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not die,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, with enthusiastic firmness; \xe2\x80\x9csay what\r\nyou like o\xc3\xad me--think what you like o\xc3\xad me--only promise--for I doubt your\r\nproud heart--that ye wunna harm yourself, and you shall not die this\r\nshameful death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _shameful_ death I will not die, Jeanie, lass. I have that in my\r\nheart--though it has been ower kind a ane--that wunna bide shame. Gae\r\nhame to our father, and think nae mair on me--I have eat my last earthly\r\nmeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, this was what I feared!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout, tout, hinny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xc3\xads but little ye ken o\xc3\xad thae\r\nthings. Ane aye thinks at the first dinnle o\xc3\xad the sentence, they hae\r\nheart eneugh to die rather than bide out the sax weeks; but they aye bide\r\nthe sax weeks out for a\xc3\xad that. I ken the gate o\xc3\xadt weel; I hae fronted the\r\ndoomster three times, and here I stand, Jim Ratcliffe, for a\xc3\xad that. Had I\r\ntied my napkin strait the first time, as I had a great mind till\xc3\xadt--and\r\nit was a\xc3\xad about a bit grey cowt, wasna worth ten punds sterling--where\r\nwould I have been now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how _did_ you escape?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, the fates of this man, at first\r\nso odious to her, having acquired a sudden interest in her eyes from\r\ntheir correspondence with those of her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_How_ did I escape?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, with a knowing wink,--\xe2\x80\x9cI tell ye I\r\n\xc3\xabscapit in a way that naebody will escape from this Tolbooth while I keep\r\nthe keys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister shall come out in the face of the sun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\ngo to London, and beg her pardon from the king and queen. If they\r\npardoned Porteous, they may pardon her; if a sister asks a sister\xc3\xads life\r\non her bended knees, they will pardon her--they _shall_ pardon her--and\r\nthey will win a thousand hearts by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEffie listened in bewildered astonishment, and so earnest was her\r\nsister\xc3\xads enthusiastic assurance, that she almost involuntarily caught a\r\ngleam of hope; but it instantly faded away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Jeanie! the king and queen live in London, a thousand miles from\r\nthis--far ayont the saut sea; I\xc3\xadll be gane before ye win there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cit is no sae far, and they go to it by\r\nland; I learned something about thae things from Reuben Butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Jeanie! ye never learned onything but what was gude frae the folk ye\r\nkeepit company wi\xc3\xad; but!--but!\xe2\x80\x9d--she wrung her hands and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinna think on that now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be time for that if\r\nthe present space be redeemed. Fare ye weel. Unless I die by the road, I\r\nwill see the king\xc3\xads face that gies grace--O, sir\xe2\x80\x9d (to Ratcliffe), \xe2\x80\x9cbe\r\nkind to her--She ne\xc3\xader ken\xc3\xadd what it was to need a stranger\xc3\xads kindness\r\ntill now.--Fareweel--fareweel, Effie!--Dinna speak to me--I maunna greet\r\nnow--my head\xc3\xads ower dizzy already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tore herself from her sister\xc3\xads arms, and left the cell. Ratcliffe\r\nfollowed her, and beckoned her into a small room. She obeyed his signal,\r\nbut not without trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xc3\xads the fule thing shaking for?\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI mean nothing but\r\ncivility to you. D--n me, I respect you, and I can\xc3\xadt help it. You have so\r\nmuch spunk, that d--n me, but I think there\xc3\xads some chance of your\r\ncarrying the day. But you must not go to the king till you have made some\r\nfriend; try the duke--try MacCallummore; he\xc3\xads Scotland\xc3\xads friend--I ken\r\nthat the great folks dinna muckle like him--but they fear him, and that\r\nwill serve your purpose as weel. D\xc3\xadye ken naebody wad gie ye a letter to\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuke of Argyle!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, recollecting herself suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was\r\nhe to that Argyle that suffered in my father\xc3\xads time--in the persecution?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis son or grandson, I\xc3\xadm thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what o\xc3\xad that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, devoutly clasping her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou whigs are aye thanking God for something,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ruffian. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nhark ye, hinny, I\xc3\xadll tell ye a secret. Ye may meet wi\xc3\xad rough customers on\r\nthe Border, or in the Midland, afore ye get to Lunnon. Now, deil ane o\xc3\xad\r\nthem will touch an acquaintance o\xc3\xad Daddie Ratton\xc3\xads; for though I am\r\nretired frae public practice, yet they ken I can do a gude or an ill turn\r\nyet--and deil a gude fellow that has been but a twelvemonth on the lay,\r\nbe he ruffler or padder, but he knows my gybe* as well as the jark** of\r\ne\xc3\xader a queer cuffin*** in England--and there\xc3\xads rogue\xc3\xads Latin for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Pass.\r\n** Seal.\r\n*** Justice of Peace.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed totally unintelligible to Jeanie Deans, who was only\r\nimpatient to escape from him. He hastily scrawled a line or two on a\r\ndirty piece of paper, and said to her, as she drew back when he offered\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x9cHey!--what the deil--it wunna bite you, my lass--if it does nae\r\ngude, it can do nae ill. But I wish you to show it, if you have ony\r\nfasherie wi\xc3\xad ony o\xc3\xad St. Nicholas\xc3\xads clerks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, if ye fall among thieves, my precious,--that is a Scripture\r\nphrase, if ye will hae ane--the bauldest of them will ken a scart o\xc3\xad my\r\nguse feather. And now awa wi\xc3\xad ye--and stick to Argyle; if onybody can do\r\nthe job, it maun be him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter casting an anxious look at the grated windows and blackened walls\r\nof the old Tolbooth, and another scarce less anxious at the hospitable\r\nlodging of Mrs. Saddletree, Jeanie turned her back on that quarter, and\r\nsoon after on the city itself. She reached St. Leonard\xc3\xads Crags without\r\nmeeting any one whom she knew, which, in the state of her mind, she\r\nconsidered as a great blessing. \xe2\x80\x9cI must do naething,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, as she\r\nwent along, \xe2\x80\x9cthat can soften or weaken my heart--it\xc3\xads ower weak already\r\nfor what I hae to do. I will think and act as firmly as I can, and speak\r\nas little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an ancient servant, or rather cottar, of her father\xc3\xads, who had\r\nlived under him for many years, and whose fidelity was worthy of full\r\nconfidence. She sent for this woman, and explaining to her that the\r\ncircumstances of her family required that she should undertake a journey,\r\nwhich would detain her for some weeks from home, she gave her full\r\ninstructions concerning the management of the domestic concerns in her\r\nabsence. With a precision, which, upon reflection, she herself could not\r\nhelp wondering at, she described and detailed the most minute steps which\r\nwere to be taken, and especially such as were necessary for her father\xc3\xads\r\ncomfort. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was probable,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he would return to St.\r\nLeonard\xc3\xads to-morrow! certain that he would return very soon--all must be\r\nin order for him. He had eneugh to distress him, without being fashed\r\nabout warldly matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile she toiled busily, along with May Hettly, to leave\r\nnothing unarranged.\r\n\r\nIt was deep in the night when all these matters were settled; and when\r\nthey had partaken of some food, the first which Jeanie had tasted on that\r\neventful day, May Hettly, whose usual residence was a cottage at a little\r\ndistance from Deans\xc3\xads house, asked her young mistress, whether she would\r\nnot permit her to remain in the house all night? \xe2\x80\x9cYe hae had an awfu\xc3\xad\r\nday,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand sorrow and fear are but bad companions in the\r\nwatches of the night, as I hae heard the gudeman say himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are ill companions indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I maun learn to abide\r\ntheir presence, and better begin in the house than in the field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dismissed her aged assistant accordingly,--for so slight was the\r\ngradation in their rank of life, that we can hardly term May a\r\nservant,--and proceeded to make a few preparations for her journey.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of her education and country made these preparations very\r\nbrief and easy. Her tartan screen served all the purposes of a\r\nriding-habit and of an umbrella; a small bundle contained such changes of\r\nlinen as were absolutely necessary. Barefooted, as Sancho says, she had\r\ncome into the world, and barefooted she proposed to perform her\r\npilgrimage; and her clean shoes and change of snow-white thread stockings\r\nwere to be reserved for special occasions of ceremony. She was not aware,\r\nthat the English habits of comfort attach an idea of abject misery to the\r\nidea of a barefooted traveller; and if the objection of cleanliness had\r\nbeen made to the practice, she would have been apt to vindicate herself\r\nupon the very frequent ablutions to which, with Mahometan scrupulosity, a\r\nScottish damsel of some condition usually subjects herself. Thus far,\r\ntherefore, all was well.\r\n\r\nFrom an oaken press, or cabinet, in which her father kept a few old\r\nbooks, and two or three bundles of papers, besides his ordinary accounts\r\nand receipts, she sought out and extracted from a parcel of notes of\r\nsermons, calculations of interest, records of dying speeches of the\r\nmartyrs, and the like, one or two documents which she thought might be of\r\nsome use to her upon her mission. But the most important difficulty\r\nremained behind, and it had not occurred to her until that very evening.\r\nIt was the want of money; without which it was impossible she could\r\nundertake so distant a journey as she now meditated.\r\n\r\nDavid Deans, as we have said, was easy, and even opulent in his\r\ncircumstances. But his wealth, like that of the patriarchs of old,\r\nconsisted in his kine and herds, and in two or three sums lent out at\r\ninterest to neighbours or relatives, who, far from being in circumstances\r\nto pay anything to account of the principal sums, thought they did all\r\nthat was incumbent on them when, with considerable difficulty, they\r\ndischarged the \xe2\x80\x9cannual rent.\xe2\x80\x9d To these debtors it would be in vain,\r\ntherefore, to apply, even with her father\xc3\xads concurrence; nor could she\r\nhope to obtain such concurrence, or assistance in any mode, without such\r\na series of explanations and debates as she felt might deprive her\r\ntotally of the power of taking the step, which, however daring and\r\nhazardous, she felt was absolutely necessary for trying the last chance\r\nin favour of her sister. Without departing from filial reverence, Jeanie\r\nhad an inward conviction that the feelings of her father, however just,\r\nand upright, and honourable, were too little in unison with the spirit of\r\nthe time to admit of his being a good judge of the measures to be adopted\r\nin this crisis. Herself more flexible in manner, though no less upright\r\nin principle, she felt that to ask his consent to her pilgrimage would be\r\nto encounter the risk of drawing down his positive prohibition, and under\r\nthat she believed her journey could not be blessed in its progress and\r\nevent. Accordingly, she had determined upon the means by which she might\r\ncommunicate to him her undertaking and its purpose, shortly after her\r\nactual departure. But it was impossible to apply to him for money without\r\naltering this arrangement, and discussing fully the propriety of her\r\njourney; pecuniary assistance from that quarter, therefore, was laid out\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\nIt now occurred to Jeanie that she should have consulted with Mrs.\r\nSaddletree on this subject. But, besides the time that must now\r\nnecessarily be lost in recurring to her assistance Jeanie internally\r\nrevolted from it. Her heart acknowledged the goodness of Mrs.\r\nSaddletree\xc3\xads general character, and the kind interest she took in their\r\nfamily misfortunes; but still she felt that Mrs. Saddletree was a woman\r\nof an ordinary and worldly way of thinking, incapable, from habit and\r\ntemperament, of taking a keen or enthusiastic view of such a resolution\r\nas she had formed; and to debate the point with her, and to rely upon her\r\nconviction of its propriety, for the means of carrying it into execution,\r\nwould have been gall and wormwood.\r\n\r\nButler, whose assistance she might have been assured of, was greatly\r\npoorer than herself. In these circumstances, she formed a singular\r\nresolution for the purpose of surmounting this difficulty, the execution\r\nof which will form the subject of the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\n          \xc3\xabTis the voice of the sluggard, I\xc3\xadve heard him complain,\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cYou have waked me too soon, I must slumber again;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n              As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed,\r\n           Turns his side, and his shoulders, and his heavy head.\r\n                                           Dr. Watts.\r\n\r\nThe mansion-house of Dumbiedikes, to which we are now to introduce our\r\nreaders, lay three or four miles--no matter for the exact topography--to\r\nthe southward of St. Leonard\xc3\xads. It had once borne the appearance of some\r\nlittle celebrity; for the \xe2\x80\x9cauld laird,\xe2\x80\x9d whose humours and pranks were\r\noften mentioned in the ale-houses for about a mile round it, wore a\r\nsword, kept a good horse, and a brace of greyhounds; brawled, swore, and\r\nbetted at cock-fights and horse-matches; followed Somerville of Drum\xc3\xads\r\nhawks, and the Lord Ross\xc3\xads hounds, and called himself _point devise_ a\r\ngentleman. But the line had been veiled of its splendour in the present\r\nproprietor, who cared for no rustic amusements, and was as saying, timid,\r\nand retired, as his father had been at once grasping and selfishly\r\nextravagant--daring, wild, and intrusive.\r\n\r\nDumbiedikes was what is called in Scotland a single house; that is,\r\nhaving only one room occupying its whole depth from back to front, each\r\nof which single apartments was illuminated by six or eight cross lights,\r\nwhose diminutive panes and heavy frames permitted scarce so much light to\r\nenter as shines through one well-constructed modern window. This\r\ninartificial edifice, exactly such as a child would build with cards, had\r\na steep roof flagged with coarse grey stones instead of slates; a\r\nhalf-circular turret, battlemented, or, to use the appropriate phrase,\r\nbartizan\xc3\xadd on the top, served as a case for a narrow turnpike stair, by\r\nwhich an ascent was gained from storey to storey; and at the bottom of\r\nthe said turret was a door studded with large-headed nails. There was no\r\nlobby at the bottom of the tower, and scarce a landing-place opposite to\r\nthe doors which gave access to the apartments. One or two low and\r\ndilapidated outhouses, connected by a courtyard wall equally ruinous,\r\nsurrounded the mansion. The court had been paved, but the flags being\r\npartly displaced and partly renewed, a gallant crop of docks and thistles\r\nsprung up between them, and the small garden, which opened by a postern\r\nthrough the wall, seemed not to be in a much more orderly condition. Over\r\nthe low-arched gateway which led into the yard there was a carved stone,\r\nexhibiting some attempt at armorial bearings; and above the inner\r\nentrance hung, and had hung, for many years, the mouldering hatchment,\r\nwhich announced that umquhile Laurence Dumbie of Dumbiedikes had been\r\ngathered to his fathers in Newbattle kirkyard. The approach to this\r\npalace of pleasure was by a road formed by the rude fragments of stone\r\ngathered from the fields, and it was surrounded by ploughed, but\r\nunenclosed land. Upon a baulk, that is, an unploughed ridge of land\r\ninterposed among the corn, the Laird\xc3\xads trusty palfrey was tethered by the\r\nhead, and picking a meal of grass. The whole argued neglect and\r\ndiscomfort; the consequence, however, of idleness and indifference, not\r\nof poverty.\r\n\r\nIn this inner court, not without a sense of bashfulness and timidity,\r\nstood Jeanie Deans, at an early hour in a fine spring morning. She was no\r\nheroine of romance, and therefore looked with some curiosity and interest\r\non the mansion-house and domains, of which, it might at that moment occur\r\nto her, a little encouragement, such as women of all ranks know by\r\ninstinct how to apply, might have made her mistress. Moreover, she was no\r\nperson of taste beyond her time, rank, and country, and certainly thought\r\nthe house of Dumbiedikes, though inferior to Holyrood House, or the\r\npalace at Dalkeith, was still a stately structure in its way, and the\r\nland a \xe2\x80\x9cvery bonny bit, if it were better seen to and done to.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nJeanie Deans was a plain, true-hearted, honest girl, who, while she\r\nacknowledged all the splendour of her old admirer\xc3\xads habitation, and the\r\nvalue of his property, never for a moment harboured a thought of doing\r\nthe Laird, Butler, or herself, the injustice, which many ladies of higher\r\nrank would not have hesitated to do to all three on much less temptation.\r\n\r\nHer present errand being with the Laird, she looked round the offices to\r\nsee if she could find any domestic to announce that she wished to see\r\nhim. As all was silence, she ventured to open one door--it was the old\r\nLaird\xc3\xads dog-kennel, now deserted, unless when occupied, as one or two\r\ntubs seemed to testify, as a washing-house. She tried another--it was the\r\nrootless shed where the hawks had been once kept, as appeared from a\r\nperch or two not yet completely rotten, and a lure and jesses which were\r\nmouldering on the wall. A third door led to the coal-house, which was\r\nwell stocked. To keep a very good fire was one of the few points of\r\ndomestic management in which Dumbiedikes was positively active; in all\r\nother matters of domestic economy he was completely passive, and at the\r\nmercy of his housekeeper--the same buxom dame whom his father had long\r\nsince bequeathed to his charge, and who, if fame did her no injustice,\r\nhad feathered her nest pretty well at his expense.\r\n\r\nJeanie went on opening doors, like the second Calender wanting an eye, in\r\nthe castle of the hundred obliging damsels, until, like the said prince\r\nerrant, she came to a stable. The Highland Pegasus, Rory Bean, to which\r\nbelonged the single entire stall, was her old acquaintance, whom she had\r\nseen grazing on the baulk, as she failed not to recognise by the\r\nwell-known ancient riding furniture and demi-pique saddle, which half\r\nhung on the walls, half trailed on the litter. Beyond the \xe2\x80\x9ctreviss,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n which formed one side of the stall, stood a cow, who turned her head and\r\nlowed when Jeanie came into the stable, an appeal which her habitual\r\noccupations enabled her perfectly to understand, and with which she could\r\nnot refuse complying, by shaking down some fodder to the animal, which\r\nhad been neglected like most things else in the castle of the sluggard.\r\n\r\nWhile she was accommodating \xe2\x80\x9cthe milky mother\xe2\x80\x9d with the food which she\r\nshould have received two hours sooner, a slipshod wench peeped into the\r\nstable, and perceiving that a stranger was employed in discharging the\r\ntask which she, at length, and reluctantly, had quitted her slumbers to\r\nperform, ejaculated,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, sirs! the Brownie! the Brownie!\xe2\x80\x9d and fled, yelling as if she had\r\nseen the devil.\r\n\r\nTo explain her terror it may be necessary to notice that the old house of\r\nDumbiedikes had, according to report, been long haunted by a Brownie, one\r\nof those familiar spirits who were believed in ancient times to supply\r\nthe deficiencies of the ordinary labourer--\r\n\r\n\r\nWhirl the long mop, and ply the airy flail.\r\n\r\nCertes, the convenience of such a supernatural assistance could have been\r\nnowhere more sensibly felt than in a family where the domestics were so\r\nlittle disposed to personal activity; yet this serving maiden was so far\r\nfrom rejoicing in seeing a supposed aerial substitute discharging a task\r\nwhich she should have long since performed herself, that she proceeded to\r\nraise the family by her screams of horror, uttered as thick as if the\r\nBrownie had been flaying her. Jeanie, who had immediately resigned her\r\ntemporary occupation, and followed the yelling damsel into the courtyard,\r\nin order to undeceive and appease her, was there met by Mrs. Janet\r\nBalchristie, the favourite sultana of the last Laird, as scandal\r\nwent--the housekeeper of the present. The good-looking buxom woman,\r\nbetwixt forty and fifty (for such we described her at the death of the\r\nlast Laird), was now a fat, red-faced, old dame of seventy, or\r\nthereabouts, fond of her place, and jealous of her authority. Conscious\r\nthat her administration did not rest on so sure a basis as in the time\r\nof the old proprietor, this considerate lady had introduced into the\r\nfamily the screamer aforesaid, who added good features and bright eyes\r\nto the powers of her lungs. She made no conquest of the Laird, however,\r\nwho seemed to live as if there was not another woman in the world but\r\nJeanie Deans, and to bear no very ardent or overbearing affection even\r\nto her. Mrs. Janet Balchristie, notwithstanding, had her own uneasy\r\nthoughts upon the almost daily visits to St. Leonard\xc3\xads Crags, and often,\r\nwhen the Laird looked at her wistfully and paused, according to his\r\ncustom before utterance, she expected him to say, \xe2\x80\x9cJenny, I am gaun to\r\nchange my condition;\xe2\x80\x9d but she was relieved by, \xe2\x80\x9cJenny, I am gaun to\r\nchange my shoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, however, Mrs. Balchristie regarded Jeanie Deans with no small\r\nportion of malevolence, the customary feeling of such persons towards\r\nanyone who they think has the means of doing them an injury. But she had\r\nalso a general aversion to any female tolerably young, and decently\r\nwell-looking, who showed a wish to approach the house of Dumbiedikes and\r\nthe proprietor thereof. And as she had raised her mass of mortality out\r\nof bed two hours earlier than usual, to come to the rescue of her\r\nclamorous niece, she was in such extreme bad humour against all and\r\nsundry, that Saddletree would have pronounced that she harboured\r\n_inimicitiam contra omnes mortales._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWha the deil are ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said the fat dame to poor Jeanie, whom she did not\r\nimmediately recognise, \xe2\x80\x9cscouping about a decent house at sic an hour in\r\nthe morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was ane wanting to speak to the Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who felt\r\nsomething of the intuitive terror which she had formerly entertained for\r\nthis termagant, when she was occasionally at Dumbiedikes on business of\r\nher father\xc3\xads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAne!--And what sort of ane are ye!--hae ye nae name?--D\xc3\xadye think his\r\nhonour has naething else to do than to speak wi\xc3\xad ilka idle tramper that\r\ncomes about the town, and him in his bed yet, honest man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mrs. Balchristie,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie, in a submissive tone, \xe2\x80\x9cd\xc3\xadye no\r\nmind me?--d\xc3\xadye no mind Jeanie Deans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie Deans!\xe2\x80\x9d said the termagant, in accents affecting the utmost\r\nastonishment; then, taking two strides nearer to her, she peered into her\r\nface with a stare of curiosity, equally scornful and malignant--\xe2\x80\x9cI say\r\nJeanie Deans indeed--Jeanie Deevil, they had better hae ca\xc3\xaded ye!--A\r\nbonny spot o\xc3\xad wark your tittie and you hae made out, murdering ae puir\r\nwean, and your light limmer of a sister\xc3\xads to be hanged for\xc3\xadt, as weel she\r\ndeserves!--And the like o\xc3\xad you to come to ony honest man\xc3\xads house, and\r\nwant to be into a decent bachelor gentleman\xc3\xads room at this time in the\r\nmorning, and him in his bed!--Gae wa\xc3\xad, gae wa\xc3\xad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie was struck mute with shame at the unfeeling brutality of this\r\naccusation, and could not even find words to justify herself from the\r\nvile construction put upon her visit. When Mrs. Balchristie, seeing her\r\nadvantage, continued in the same tone, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, bundle up your pipes\r\nand tramp awa wi\xc3\xad ye!--ye may be seeking a father to another wean for ony\r\nthing I ken. If it warna that your father, auld David Deans, had been a\r\ntenant on our land, I would cry up the men-folk, and hae ye dookit in the\r\nburn for your impudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie had already turned her back, and was walking towards the door of\r\nthe court-yard, so that Mrs. Balchristie, to make her last threat\r\nimpressively audible to her, had raised her stentorian voice to its\r\nutmost pitch. But, like many a general, she lost the engagement by\r\npressing her advantage too far.\r\n\r\nThe Laird had been disturbed in his morning slumbers by the tones of Mrs.\r\nBalchristie\xc3\xads objurgation, sounds in themselves by no means uncommon, but\r\nvery remarkable, in respect to the early hour at which they were now\r\nheard. He turned himself on the other side, however, in hopes the squall\r\nwould blow by, when, in the course of Mrs. Balchristie\xc3\xads second explosion\r\nof wrath, the name of Deans distinctly struck the tympanum of his ear. As\r\nhe was, in some degree, aware of the small portion of benevolence with\r\nwhich his housekeeper regarded the family at St. Leonard\xc3\xads, he instantly\r\nconceived that some message from thence was the cause of this untimely\r\nire, and getting out of his bed, he slipt as speedily as possible into an\r\nold brocaded night-gown, and some other necessary garments, clapped on\r\nhis head his father\xc3\xads gold-laced hat (for though he was seldom seen\r\nwithout it, yet it is proper to contradict the popular report that he\r\nslept in it, as Don Quixote did in his helmet), and opening the window of\r\nhis bedroom, beheld, to his great astonishment, the well-known figure of\r\nJeanie Deans herself retreating from his gate; while his housekeeper,\r\nwith arms a-kimbo, fist clenched and extended, body erect, and head\r\nshaking with rage, sent after her a volley of Billingsgate oaths. His\r\ncholer rose in proportion to the surprise, and, perhaps, to the\r\ndisturbance of his repose. \xe2\x80\x9cHark ye,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed from the window, \xe2\x80\x9cye\r\nauld limb of Satan--wha the deil gies you commission to guide an honest\r\nman\xc3\xads daughter that gate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Balchristie was completely caught in the manner. She was aware, from\r\nthe unusual warmth with which the Laird expressed himself, that he was\r\nquite serious in this matter, and she knew, that with all his indolence\r\nof nature, there were points on which he might be provoked, and that,\r\nbeing provoked, he had in him something dangerous, which her wisdom\r\ntaught her to fear accordingly. She began, therefore, to retract her\r\nfalse step as fast as she could. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was but speaking for the house\xc3\xads\r\ncredit, and she couldna think of disturbing his honour in the morning sae\r\nearly, when the young woman might as weel wait or call again; and to be\r\nsure, she might make a mistake between the twa sisters, for ane o\xc3\xad them\r\nwasna sae creditable an acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaud your peace, ye auld jade,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes; \xe2\x80\x9cthe warst quean e\xc3\xader\r\nstude in their shoon may ca\xc3\xad you cousin, an a\xc3\xad be true that I have\r\nheard.--Jeanie, my woman, gang into the parlour--but stay, that winna be\r\nredd up yet--wait there a minute till I come down to let ye in--Dinna\r\nmind what Jenny says to ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jenny, with a laugh of affected heartiness, \xe2\x80\x9cnever mind\r\nme, lass--a\xc3\xad the warld kens my bark\xc3\xads waur than my bite--if ye had had an\r\nappointment wi\xc3\xad the Laird, ye might hae tauld me--I am nae uncivil\r\nperson--gang your ways in by, hinny,\xe2\x80\x9d and she opened the door of the\r\nhouse with a master-key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I had no appointment wi\xc3\xad the Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, drawing back; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant just to speak twa words to him, and I wad rather do it standing\r\nhere, Mrs. Balchristie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the open court-yard!--Na, na, that wad never do, lass; we mauna guide\r\nye that gate neither--And how\xc3\xads that douce honest man, your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie was saved the pain of answering this hypocritical question by the\r\nappearance of the Laird himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGang in and get breakfast ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to his housekeeper--\xe2\x80\x9cand, d\xc3\xadye\r\nhear, breakfast wi\xc3\xad us yoursell--ye ken how to manage thae porringers of\r\ntea-water--and, hear ye, see abune a\xc3\xad that there\xc3\xads a gude fire.--Weel,\r\nJeanie, my woman, gang in by--gang in by, and rest ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeanie replied, endeavouring as much as she could to express\r\nherself with composure, notwithstanding she still trembled, \xe2\x80\x9cI canna gang\r\nin--I have a lang day\xc3\xads darg afore me--I maun be twenty mile o\xc3\xad gate the\r\nnight yet, if feet will carry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuide and deliver us!--twenty mile--twenty mile on your feet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n ejaculated Dumbiedikes, whose walks were of a very circumscribed\r\ndiameter,--\xe2\x80\x9cYe maun never think o\xc3\xad that--come in by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna do that, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cthe twa words I have to say to\r\nye I can say here; forby that Mrs. Balchristie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deil flee awa wi\xc3\xad Mrs. Balchristie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xc3\xadll\r\nhae a heavy lading o\xc3\xad her! I tell ye, Jeanie Deans, I am a man of few\r\nwords, but I am laird at hame, as well as in the field; deil a brute or\r\nbody about my house but I can manage when I like, except Rory Bean, my\r\npowny; but I can seldom be at the plague, an it binna when my bluid\xc3\xads\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was wanting to say to ye, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who felt the necessity\r\nof entering upon her business, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I was gaun a lang journey, outby of\r\nmy father\xc3\xads knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOutby his knowledge, Jeanie!--Is that right? Ye maun think ot\r\nagain--it\xc3\xads no right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes, with a countenance of great\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were ance at Lunnon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, in exculpation, \xe2\x80\x9cI am amaist\r\nsure I could get means to speak to the queen about my sister\xc3\xads life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLunnon--and the queen--and her sister\xc3\xads life!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes,\r\nwhistling for very amazement--\xe2\x80\x9cthe lassie\xc3\xads demented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no out o\xc3\xad my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand sink or swim, I am determined to\r\ngang to Lunnon, if I suld beg my way frae door to door--and so I maun,\r\nunless ye wad lend me a small sum to pay my expenses--little thing will\r\ndo it; and ye ken my father\xc3\xads a man of substance, and wad see nae man,\r\nfar less you, Laird, come to loss by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDumbiedikes, on comprehending the nature of this application, could\r\nscarce trust his ears--he made no answer whatever, but stood with his\r\neyes rivetted on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see ye are no for assisting me, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9csae fare ye\r\nweel--and gang and see my poor father as aften as ye can--he will be\r\nlonely eneugh now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the silly bairn gaun?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes; and, laying hold of\r\nher hand, he led her into the house. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads no that I didna think o\xc3\xadt\r\nbefore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it stack in my throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus speaking to himself, he led her into an old-fashioned parlour, shut\r\nthe door behind them, and fastened it with a bolt. While Jeanie,\r\nsurprised at this manoeuvre, remained as near the door as possible, the\r\nLaird quitted her hand, and pressed upon a spring lock fixed in an oak\r\npanel in the wainscot, which instantly slipped aside. An iron strong-box\r\nwas discovered in a recess of the wall; he opened this also, and pulling\r\nout two or three drawers, showed that they were filled with leathern bags\r\nfull of gold and silver coin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my bank, Jeanie lass,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking first at her and then at\r\nthe treasure, with an air of great complacency,--\xe2\x80\x9cnane o\xc3\xad your\r\ngoldsmith\xc3\xads bills for me,--they bring folk to ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly changing his tone, he resolutely said,--\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie, I will\r\nmake ye Lady Dumbiedikes afore the sun sets and ye may ride to Lunnon in\r\nyour ain coach, if ye like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat can never be--my father\xc3\xads grief--my\r\nsister\xc3\xads situation--the discredit to you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads _my_ business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes; \xe2\x80\x9cye wad say naething about that\r\nif ye werena a fule--and yet I like ye the better for\xc3\xadt--ae wise body\xc3\xads\r\neneugh in the married state. But if your heart\xc3\xads ower fu\xc3\xad, take what\r\nsiller will serve ye, and let it be when ye come back again--as gude syne\r\nas sune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who felt the necessity of being explicit with\r\nso extraordinary a lover, \xe2\x80\x9cI like another man better than you, and I\r\ncanna marry ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother man better than me, Jeanie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes; \xe2\x80\x9chow is that\r\npossible? It\xc3\xads no possible, woman--ye hae ken\xc3\xadd me sae lang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy but, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, with persevering simplicity, \xe2\x80\x9cI hae ken\xc3\xadd\r\nhim langer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLanger! It\xc3\xads no possible!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the poor Laird. \xe2\x80\x9cIt canna be; ye\r\nwere born on the land. O Jeanie woman, ye haena lookit--ye haena seen the\r\nhalf o\xc3\xad the gear.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew out another drawer--\xe2\x80\x9cA\xc3\xad gowd, Jeanie, and\r\nthere\xc3\xads bands for siller lent--And the rental book, Jeanie--clear three\r\nhunder sterling--deil a wadset, heritable band, or burden--Ye haena\r\nlookit at them, woman--And then my mother\xc3\xads wardrobe, and my\r\ngrandmother\xc3\xads forby--silk gowns wad stand on their ends, their\r\npearline-lace as fine as spiders\xc3\xad webs, and rings and ear-rings to the\r\nboot of a\xc3\xad that--they are a\xc3\xad in the chamber of deas--Oh, Jeanie, gang up\r\nthe stair and look at them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jeanie and the Laird of Dumbiedykes--Frontispiece]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Jeanie held fast her integrity, though beset with temptations, which\r\nperhaps the Laird of Dumbiedikes did not greatly err in supposing were\r\nthose most affecting to her sex.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt canna be, Laird--I have said it--and I canna break my word till him,\r\nif ye wad gie me the haill barony of Dalkeith, and Lugton into the\r\nbargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour word to _him,_\xe2\x80\x9d said the Laird, somewhat pettishly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut wha is he,\r\nJeanie?--wha is he?--I haena heard his name yet--Come now, Jeanie, ye are\r\nbut queering us--I am no trowing that there is sic a ane in the warld--ye\r\nare but making fashion--What is he?--wha is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust Reuben Butler, that\xc3\xads schulemaster at Liberton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReuben Butler! Reuben Butler!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the Laird of Dumbiedikes, pacing\r\nthe apartment in high disdain,--\xe2\x80\x9cReuben Butler, the dominie at\r\nLiberton--and a dominie depute too!--Reuben, the son of my cottar!--Very\r\nweel, Jeanie lass, wilfu\xc3\xad woman will hae her way--Reuben Butler! he\r\nhasna in his pouch the value o\xc3\xad the auld black coat he wears--But it\r\ndisna signify.\xe2\x80\x9d And as he spoke, he shut successively and with vehemence\r\nthe drawers of his treasury. \xe2\x80\x9cA fair offer, Jeanie, is nae cause of\r\nfeud--Ae man may bring a horse to the water, but twenty winna gar him\r\ndrink--And as for wasting my substance on other folk\xc3\xads joes--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in the last hint that nettled Jeanie\xc3\xads honest pride.--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was begging nane frae your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cleast of a\xc3\xad on sic a\r\nscore as ye pit it on.--Gude morning to ye, sir; ye hae been kind to my\r\nfather, and it isna in my heart to think otherwise than kindly of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she left the room without listening to a faint \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\r\nJeanie--Jeanie--stay, woman!\xe2\x80\x9d and traversing the courtyard with a quick\r\nstep, she set out on her forward journey, her bosom glowing with that\r\nnatural indignation and shame, which an honest mind feels at having\r\nsubjected itself to ask a favour, which had been unexpectedly refused.\r\nWhen out of the Laird\xc3\xads ground, and once more upon the public road, her\r\npace slackened, her anger cooled, and anxious anticipations of the\r\nconsequence of this unexpected disappointment began to influence her\r\nwith other feelings. Must she then actually beg her way to London? for\r\nsuch seemed the alternative; or must she turn back, and solicit her\r\nfather for money? and by doing so lose time, which was precious, besides\r\nthe risk of encountering his positive prohibition respecting the\r\njourney! Yet she saw no medium between these alternatives; and, while\r\nshe walked slowly on, was still meditating whether it were not better to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nWhile she was thus in an uncertainty, she heard the clatter of a horse\xc3\xads\r\nhoofs, and a well-known voice calling her name. She looked round, and saw\r\nadvancing towards her on a pony, whose bare back and halter assorted ill\r\nwith the nightgown, slippers, and laced cocked-hat of the rider, a\r\ncavalier of no less importance than Dumbiedikes himself. In the energy of\r\nhis pursuit, he had overcome even the Highland obstinacy of Rory Bean,\r\nand compelled that self-willed palfrey to canter the way his rider chose;\r\nwhich Rory, however, performed with all the symptoms of reluctance,\r\nturning his head, and accompanying every bound he made in advance with a\r\nsidelong motion, which indicated his extreme wish to turn round,--a\r\nmanoeuvre which nothing but the constant exercise of the Laird\xc3\xads heels\r\nand cudgel could possibly have counteracted.\r\n\r\nWhen the Laird came up with Jeanie, the first words he uttered\r\nwere,--\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie, they say ane shouldna aye take a woman at her first\r\nword?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but ye maun take me at mine, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, looking on the\r\nground, and walking on without a pause.--\xe2\x80\x9cI hae but ae word to bestow on\r\nony body, and that\xc3\xads aye a true ane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes, \xe2\x80\x9cat least ye suldna aye take a man at _his_\r\nfirst word. Ye maunna gang this wilfu\xc3\xad gate sillerless, come o\xc3\xadt what\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d--He put a purse into her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI wad gie you Rory too, but he\xc3\xads\r\nas wilfu\xc3\xad as yoursell, and he\xc3\xads ower weel used to a gate that maybe he\r\nand I hae gaen ower aften, and he\xc3\xadll gang nae road else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Laird,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I ken my father will satisfy every\r\npenny of this siller, whatever there\xc3\xads o\xc3\xadt, yet I wadna like to borrow it\r\nfrae ane that maybe thinks of something mair than the paying o\xc3\xadt back\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xc3\xads just twenty-five guineas o\xc3\xadt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dumbiedikes, with a gentle\r\nsigh, \xe2\x80\x9cand whether your father pays or disna pay, I make ye free till\xc3\xadt\r\nwithout another word. Gang where ye like--do what ye like--and marry a\xc3\xad\r\nthe Butlers in the country gin ye like--And sae, gude morning to you,\r\nJeanie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd God bless you, Laird, wi\xc3\xad mony a gude morning!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, her\r\nheart more softened by the unwonted generosity of this uncouth character,\r\nthan perhaps Butler might have approved, had he known her feelings at\r\nthat moment; \xe2\x80\x9cand comfort, and the Lord\xc3\xads peace, and the peace of the\r\nworld, be with you, if we suld never meet again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDumbiedikes turned and waved his hand; and his pony, much more willing to\r\nreturn than he had been to set out, hurried him homeward so fast, that,\r\nwanting the aid of a regular bridle, as well as of saddle and stirrups,\r\nhe was too much puzzled to keep his seat to permit of his looking behind,\r\neven to give the parting glance of a forlorn swain. I am ashamed to say,\r\nthat the sight of a lover, ran away with in nightgown and slippers and a\r\nlaced hat, by a bare-backed Highland pony, had something in it of a\r\nsedative, even to a grateful and deserved burst of affectionate esteem.\r\nThe figure of Dumbiedikes was too ludicrous not to confirm Jeanie in the\r\noriginal sentiments she entertained towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads a gude creature,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand a kind--it\xc3\xads a pity he has sae\r\nwillyard a powny.\xe2\x80\x9d And she immediately turned her thoughts to the\r\nimportant journey which she had commenced, reflecting with pleasure,\r\nthat, according to her habits of life and of undergoing fatigue, she was\r\nnow amply or even superfluously provided with the means of encountering\r\nthe expenses of the road, up and down from London, and all other expenses\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRD\r\n\r\n                     What strange and wayward thoughts will slide\r\n                         Into a lover\xc3\xads head;\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cO mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d to myself I cried,\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cIf Lucy should be dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                               Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing her solitary journey, our heroine, soon after passing the\r\nhouse of Dumbiedikes, gained a little eminence, from which, on looking to\r\nthe eastward down a prattling brook, whose meanders were shaded with\r\nstraggling widows and alder trees, she could see the cottages of Woodend\r\nand Beersheba, the haunts and habitation of her early life, and could\r\ndistinguish the common on which she had so often herded sheep, and the\r\nrecesses of the rivulet where she had pulled rushes with Butler, to plait\r\ncrowns and sceptres for her sister Effie, then a beautiful but spoiled\r\nchild, of about three years old. The recollections which the scene\r\nbrought with them were so bitter, that, had she indulged them, she would\r\nhave sate down and relieved her heart with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I ken\xc3\xadd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, when she gave an account of her pilgrimage,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat greeting would do but little good, and that it was mair beseeming\r\nto thank the Lord, that had showed me kindness and countenance by means\r\nof a man, that mony ca\xc3\xadd a Nabal, and churl, but wha was free of his\r\ngudes to me, as ever the fountain was free of the stream. And I minded\r\nthe Scripture about the sin of Israel at Meribah, when the people\r\nmurmured, although Moses had brought water from the dry rock that the\r\ncongregation might drink and live. Sae, I wad not trust mysell with\r\nanother look at puir Woodend, for the very blue reek that came out of the\r\nlum-head pat me in mind of the change of market days with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this resigned and Christian temper she pursued her journey until she\r\nwas beyond this place of melancholy recollections, and not distant from\r\nthe village where Butler dwelt, which, with its old-fashioned church and\r\nsteeple, rises among a tuft of trees, occupying the ridge of an eminence\r\nto the south of Edinburgh. At a quarter of a mile\xc3\xads distance is a clumsy\r\nsquare tower, the residence of the Laird of Liberton, who, in former\r\ntimes, with the habits of the predatory chivalry of Germany, is said\r\nfrequently to have annoyed the city of Edinburgh, by intercepting the\r\nsupplies and merchandise which came to the town from the southward.\r\n\r\nThis village, its tower, and its church, did not lie precisely in\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads road towards England; but they were not much aside from it, and\r\nthe village was the abode of Butler. She had resolved to see him in the\r\nbeginning of her journey, because she conceived him the most proper\r\nperson to write to her father concerning her resolution and her hopes.\r\nThere was probably another reason latent in her affectionate bosom. She\r\nwished once more to see the object of so early and so sincere an\r\nattachment, before commencing a pilgrimage, the perils of which she did\r\nnot disguise from herself, although she did not allow them so to press\r\nupon her mind as to diminish the strength and energy of her resolution. A\r\nvisit to a lover from a young person in a higher rank of life than\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads, would have had something forward and improper in its character.\r\nBut the simplicity of her rural habits was unacquainted with these\r\npunctilious ideas of decorum, and no notion, therefore, of impropriety\r\ncrossed her imagination, as, setting out upon a long journey, she went to\r\nbid adieu to an early friend.\r\n\r\nThere was still another motive that pressed upon her mind with additional\r\nforce as she approached the village. She had looked anxiously for Butler\r\nin the courthouse, and had expected that, certainly, in some part of that\r\neventful day, he would have appeared to bring such countenance and\r\nsupport as he could give to his old friend, and the protector of his\r\nyouth, even if her own claims were laid aside.\r\n\r\nShe know, indeed, that he was under a certain degree of restraint; but\r\nshe still had hoped that he would have found means to emancipate himself\r\nfrom it, at least for one day. In short, the wild and wayward thoughts\r\nwhich Wordsworth has described as rising in an absent lover\xc3\xads\r\nimagination, suggested, as the only explanation of his absence, that\r\nButler must be very ill. And so much had this wrought on her imagination,\r\nthat when she approached the cottage where her lover occupied a small\r\napartment, and which had been pointed out to her by a maiden with a\r\nmilk-pail on her head, she trembled at anticipating the answer she might\r\nreceive on inquiring for him.\r\n\r\nHer fears in this case had, indeed, only hit upon the truth. Butler,\r\nwhose constitution was naturally feeble, did not soon recover the fatigue\r\nof body and distress of mind which he had suffered, in consequence of the\r\ntragical events with which our narrative commenced. The painful idea that\r\nhis character was breathed on by suspicion, was an aggravation to his\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nBut the most cruel addition was the absolute prohibition laid by the\r\nmagistrates on his holding any communication with Deans or his family. It\r\nhad unfortunately appeared likely to them, that some intercourse might be\r\nagain attempted with that family by Robertson, through the medium of\r\nButler, and this they were anxious to intercept, or prevent if possible.\r\nThe measure was not meant as a harsh or injurious severity on the part of\r\nthe magistrates; but, in Butler\xc3\xads circumstances, it pressed cruelly hard.\r\nHe felt he must be suffering under the bad opinion of the person who was\r\ndearest to him, from an imputation of unkind desertion, the most alien to\r\nhis nature.\r\n\r\nThis painful thought, pressing on a frame already injured, brought on a\r\nsuccession of slow and lingering feverish attacks, which greatly impaired\r\nhis health, and at length rendered him incapable even of the sedentary\r\nduties of the school, on which his bread depended. Fortunately, old Mr.\r\nWhackbairn, who was the principal teacher of the little parochial\r\nestablishment, was sincerely attached to Butler. Besides that he was\r\nsensible of his merits and value as an assistant, which had greatly\r\nraised the credit of his little school, the ancient pedagogue, who had\r\nhimself been tolerably educated, retained some taste for classical lore,\r\nand would gladly relax, after the drudgery of the school was over, by\r\nconning over a few pages of Horace or Juvenal with his usher. A\r\nsimilarity of taste begot kindness, and accordingly he saw Butler\xc3\xads\r\nincreasing debility with great compassion, roused up his own energies to\r\nteaching the school in the morning hours, insisted upon his assistant\xc3\xads\r\nreposing himself at that period, and, besides, supplied him with such\r\ncomforts as the patient\xc3\xads situation required, and his own means were\r\ninadequate to compass.\r\n\r\nSuch was Butler\xc3\xads situation, scarce able to drag himself to the place\r\nwhere his daily drudgery must gain his daily bread, and racked with a\r\nthousand fearful anticipations concerning the fate of those who were\r\ndearest to him in the world, when the trial and condemnation of Effie\r\nDeans put the copestone upon his mental misery.\r\n\r\nHe had a particular account of these events, from a fellow-student who\r\nresided in the same village, and who, having been present on the\r\nmelancholy occasion, was able to place it in all its agony of horrors\r\nbefore his excruciated imagination. That sleep should have visited his\r\neyes after such a curfew-note, was impossible. A thousand dreadful\r\nvisions haunted his imagination all night, and in the morning he was\r\nawaked from a feverish slumber, by the only circumstance which could have\r\nadded to his distress,--the visit of an intrusive ass.\r\n\r\nThis unwelcome visitant was no other than Bartoline Saddletree. The\r\nworthy and sapient burgher had kept his appointment at MacCroskie\xc3\xads with\r\nPlumdamas and some other neighbours, to discuss the Duke of Argyle\xc3\xads\r\nspeech, the justice of Effie Deans\xc3\xads condemnation, and the improbability\r\nof her obtaining a reprieve. This sage conclave disputed high and drank\r\ndeep, and on the next morning Bartoline felt, as he expressed it, as if\r\nhis head was like a \xe2\x80\x9cconfused progress of writs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo bring his reflective powers to their usual serenity, Saddle-tree\r\nresolved to take a morning\xc3\xads ride upon a certain hackney, which he,\r\nPlumdamas, and another honest shopkeeper, combined to maintain by joint\r\nsubscription, for occasional jaunts for the purpose of business or\r\nexercise. As Saddletree had two children boarded with Whackbairn, and\r\nwas, as we have seen, rather fond of Butler\xc3\xads society, he turned his\r\npalfrey\xc3\xads head towards Liberton, and came, as we have already said, to\r\ngive the unfortunate usher that additional vexation, of which Imogene\r\ncomplains so feelingly, when she says,--\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadm sprighted with a fool--\r\n                     Sprighted and anger\xc3\xadd worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf anything could have added gall to bitterness, it was the choice which\r\nSaddletree made of a subject for his prosing harangues, being the trial\r\nof Effie Deans, and the probability of her being executed. Every word\r\nfell on Butler\xc3\xads ear like the knell of a death-bell, or the note of a\r\nscreech-owl.\r\n\r\nJeanie paused at the door of her lover\xc3\xads humble abode upon hearing the\r\nloud and pompous tones of Saddletree sounding from the inner apartment,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCredit me, it will be sae, Mr. Butler. Brandy cannot save her. She maun\r\ngang down the Bow wi\xc3\xad the lad in the pioted coat* at her heels.--\r\n\r\n* The executioner, in livery of black or dark grey and silver, likened by\r\nlow wit to a magpie.\r\n\r\nI am sorry for the lassie, but the law, sir, maun hae its course--\r\n\r\n                              Vivat Rex,\r\n                              Currat Lex,\r\n\r\nas the poet has it, in whilk of Horace\xc3\xads odes I know not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Butler groaned, in utter impatience of the brutality and ignorance\r\nwhich Bartoline had contrived to amalgamate into one sentence. But\r\nSaddletree, like other prosers, was blessed with a happy obtuseness of\r\nperception concerning the unfavourable impression which he sometimes made\r\non his auditors. He proceeded to deal forth his scraps of legal knowledge\r\nwithout mercy, and concluded by asking Butler, with great\r\nself-complacency, \xe2\x80\x9cWas it na a pity my father didna send me to Utrecht?\r\nHavena I missed the chance to turn out as _clarissimus_ an _ictus,_ as\r\nauld Grunwiggin himself?--Whatfor dinna ye speak, Mr. Butler? Wad I no\r\nhae been a _clarissimus ictus?_--Eh, man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really do not understand you, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, thus\r\npushed hard for an answer. His faint and exhausted tone of voice was\r\ninstantly drowned in the sonorous bray of Bartoline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo understand me, man? _Ictus_ is Latin for a lawyer, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that ever I heard of,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Butler in the same dejected tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deil ye didna!--See, man, I got the word but this morning out of a\r\nmemorial of Mr. Crossmyloof\xc3\xads--see, there it is, _ictus clarissimus et\r\nperti--peritissimus_--it\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad Latin, for it\xc3\xads printed in the Italian\r\ntypes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you mean _juris-consultus--Ictus_ is an abbreviation for\r\n_juris-consultus._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinna tell me, man,\xe2\x80\x9d persevered Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads nae abbreviates\r\nexcept in adjudications; and this is a\xc3\xad about a servitude of\r\nwater-drap--that is to say, _tillicidian_* (maybe ye\xc3\xadll say that\xc3\xads no\r\nLatin neither), in Mary King\xc3\xads Close in the High Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* He meant, probably, _stillicidium._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Butler, overwhelmed by the noisy perseverance of\r\nhis visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cIam not able to dispute with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFew folk are--few folk are, Mr. Butler, though I say it that shouldna\r\nsay it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Bartoline with great delight. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, it will be twa\r\nhours yet or ye\xc3\xadre wanted in the schule, and as ye are no weel, I\xc3\xadll sit\r\nwi\xc3\xad you to divert ye, and explain t\xc3\xadye the nature of a _tillicidian._ Ye\r\nmaun ken, the petitioner, Mrs. Crombie, a very decent woman, is a friend\r\nof mine, and I hae stude her friend in this case, and brought her wi\xc3\xad\r\ncredit into the court, and I doubtna that in due time she will win out\r\no\xc3\xadt wi\xc3\xad credit, win she or lose she. Ye see, being an inferior tenement\r\nor laigh house, we grant ourselves to be burdened wi\xc3\xad the _tillicide,_\r\nthat is, that we are obligated to receive the natural water-drap of the\r\nsuperior tenement, sae far as the same fa\xc3\xads frae the heavens, or the roof\r\nof our neighbour\xc3\xads house, and from thence by the gutters or eaves upon\r\nour laigh tenement. But the other night comes a Highland quean of a lass,\r\nand she flashes, God kens what, out at the eastmost window of Mrs.\r\nMacPhail\xc3\xads house, that\xc3\xads the superior tenement. I believe the auld women\r\nwad hae agreed, for Luckie MacPhail sent down the lass to tell my friend\r\nMrs. Crombie that she had made the gardyloo out of the wrang window, out\r\nof respect for twa Highlandmen that were speaking Gaelic in the close\r\nbelow the right ane. But luckily for Mrs. Crombie, I just chanced to come\r\nin in time to break aff the communing, for it\xc3\xads a pity the point suldna\r\nbe tried. We had Mrs. MacPhail into the Ten-Mark Court--The Hieland\r\nlimmer of a lass wanted to swear herself free--but haud ye there,\r\nsays I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe detailed account of this important suit might have lasted until poor\r\nButler\xc3\xads hour of rest was completely exhausted, had not Saddletree been\r\ninterrupted by the noise of voices at the door. The woman of the house\r\nwhere Butler lodged, on returning with her pitcher from the well, whence\r\nshe had been fetching water for the family, found our heroine Jeanie\r\nDeans standing at the door, impatient of the prolix harangue of\r\nSaddletree, yet unwilling to enter until he should have taken his leave.\r\n\r\nThe good woman abridged the period of hesitation by inquiring, \xe2\x80\x9cWas ye\r\nwanting the gudeman or me, lass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to speak with Mr. Butler, if he\xc3\xads at leisure,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGang in by then, my woman,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the goodwife; and opening the door\r\nof a room, she announced the additional visitor with, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Butler, here\xc3\xads\r\na lass wants to speak t\xc3\xadye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surprise of Butler was extreme, when Jeanie, who seldom stirred\r\nhalf-a-mile from home, entered his apartment upon this annunciation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, starting from his chair, while alarm restored to his\r\ncheek the colour of which sickness had deprived it; \xe2\x80\x9csome new misfortune\r\nmust have happened!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, Mr. Reuben, but what you must hae heard of--but oh, ye are looking\r\nill yoursell!\xe2\x80\x9d--for the \xe2\x80\x9chectic of a moment\xe2\x80\x9d had not concealed from her\r\naffectionate eyes the ravages which lingering disease and anxiety of mind\r\nhad made in her lover\xc3\xads person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: I am well--quite well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler with eagerness; \xe2\x80\x9cif I can do\r\nanything to assist you, Jeanie--or your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saddletree; \xe2\x80\x9cthe family may be considered as\r\nlimited to them twa now, just as if Effie had never been in the tailzie,\r\npuir thing. But, Jeanie lass, what brings you out to Liberton sae air in\r\nthe morning, and your father lying ill in the Luckenbooths?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a message frae my father to Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie with\r\nembarrassment; but instantly feeling ashamed of the fiction to which she\r\nhad resorted, for her love of and veneration for truth was almost\r\nQuaker-like, she corrected herself--\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, I wanted to speak\r\nwith Mr. Butler about some business of my father\xc3\xads and puir Effie\xc3\xads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it law business?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartoline; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause if it be, ye had better\r\ntake my opinion on the subject than his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not just law business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who saw considerable\r\ninconvenience might arise from letting Mr. Saddletree into the secret\r\npurpose of her journey; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I want Mr. Butler to write a letter for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Saddletree; \xe2\x80\x9cand if ye\xc3\xadll tell me what it is\r\nabout, I\xc3\xadll dictate to Mr. Butler as Mr. Crossmyloof does to his\r\nclerk.--Get your pen and ink in initialibus, Mr. Butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie looked at Butler, and wrung her hands with vexation and\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe, Mr. Saddletree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, who saw the necessity of\r\ngetting rid of him at all events, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Whackbairn will be somewhat\r\naffronted if you do not hear your boys called up to their lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Mr. Butler, and that\xc3\xads as true; and I promised to ask a half\r\nplay-day to the schule, so that the bairns might gang and see the\r\nhanging, which canna but have a pleasing effect on their young minds,\r\nseeing there is no knowing what they may come to themselves.--Odd so, I\r\ndidna mind ye were here, Jeanie Deans; but ye maun use yoursell to hear\r\nthe matter spoken o\xc3\xad.--Keep Jeanie here till I come back, Mr. Butler; I\r\nwinna bide ten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this unwelcome assurance of an immediate return, he relieved\r\nthem of the embarrassment of his presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReuben,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who saw the necessity of using the interval of his\r\nabsence in discussing what had brought her there, \xe2\x80\x9cI am bound on a lang\r\njourney--I am gaun to Lunnon to ask Effie\xc3\xads life of the king and of the\r\nqueen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie! you are surely not yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Butler, in the utmost\r\nsurprise;--\xe2\x80\x9c_you_ go to London--_you_ address the king and queen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what for no, Reuben?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, with all the composed simplicity\r\nof her character; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xc3\xads but speaking to a mortal man and woman when a\xc3\xad is\r\ndone. And their hearts maun be made o\xc3\xad flesh and blood like other folk\xc3\xads,\r\nand Effie\xc3\xads story wad melt them were they stane. Forby, I hae heard that\r\nthey are no sic bad folk as what the Jacobites ca\xc3\xad them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cbut their magnificence--their retinue--the\r\ndifficulty of getting audience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought of a\xc3\xad that, Reuben, and it shall not break my spirit. Nae\r\ndoubt their claiths will be very grand, wi\xc3\xad their crowns on their heads,\r\nand their sceptres in their hands, like the great King Ahasuerus when he\r\nsate upon his royal throne fornent the gate of his house, as we are told\r\nin Scripture. But I have that within me that will keep my heart from\r\nfailing, and I am amaist sure that I will be strengthened to speak the\r\nerrand I came for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! alas!\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cthe kings now-a-days do not sit in the gate\r\nto administer justice, as in patriarchal times. I know as little of\r\ncourts as you do, Jeanie, by experience; but by reading and report I\r\nknow, that the King of Britain does everything by means of his\r\nministers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if they be upright, God-fearing ministers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xc3\xads sae\r\nmuckle the better chance for Effie and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you do not even understand the most ordinary words relating to a\r\ncourt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler; \xe2\x80\x9cby the ministry is meant not clergymen, but the\r\nking\xc3\xads official servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9che maun hae a great number mair, I daur to\r\nsay, than the duchess has at Dalkeith, and great folk\xc3\xads servants are aye\r\nmair saucy than themselves. But I\xc3\xadll be decently put on, and I\xc3\xadll offer\r\nthem a trifle o\xc3\xad siller, as if I came to see the palace. Or, if they\r\nscruple that, I\xc3\xadll tell them I\xc3\xadm come on a business of life and death,\r\nand then they will surely bring me to speech of the king and queen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cO Jeanie, this is entirely a wild dream. You can\r\nnever see them but through some great lord\xc3\xads intercession, and I think it\r\nis scarce possible even then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, but maybe I can get that too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a little helping\r\nfrom you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom me, Jeanie! this is the wildest imagination of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but it is not, Reuben. Havena I heard you say, that your grandfather\r\n(that my father never likes to hear about) did some gude langsyne to the\r\nforbear of this MacCallummore, when he was Lord of Lorn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I can prove it.--I will write to\r\nthe Duke of Argyle--report speaks him a good kindly man, as he is known\r\nfor a brave soldier and true patriot--I will conjure him to stand between\r\nyour sister and this cruel fate. There is but a poor chance of success,\r\nbut we will try all means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe _must_ try all means,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut writing winna do it--a\r\nletter canna look, and pray, and beg, and beseech, as the human voice can\r\ndo to the human heart. A letter\xc3\xads like the music that the ladies have for\r\ntheir spinets--naething but black scores, compared to the same tune\r\nplayed or sung. It\xc3\xads word of mouth maun do it, or naething, Reuben.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reuben, recollecting his firmness, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will hope\r\nthat Heaven has suggested to your kind heart and firm courage the only\r\npossible means of saving the life of this unfortunate girl. But, Jeanie,\r\nyou must not take this most perilous journey alone; I have an interest in\r\nyou, and I will not agree that my Jeanie throws herself away. You must\r\neven, in the present circumstances, give me a husband\xc3\xads right to protect\r\nyou, and I will go with you myself on this journey, and assist you to do\r\nyour duty by your family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, Reuben!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie in her turn, \xe2\x80\x9cthis must not be; a pardon will\r\nnot gie my sister her fair fame again, or make me a bride fitting for an\r\nhonest man and an usefu\xc3\xad minister. Wha wad mind what he said in the\r\npu\xc3\xadpit, that had to wife the sister of a woman that was condemned for sic\r\nwickedness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded her lover, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe, and I cannot\r\nbelieve, that Effie has done this deed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven bless ye for saying sae, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she maun\r\nbear the blame o\xc3\xadt after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the blame, were it even justly laid on her, does not fall on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Reuben, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young woman, \xe2\x80\x9cye ken it is a blot that\r\nspreads to kith and kin.--Ichabod--as my poor father says--the glory is\r\ndeparted from our house; for the poorest man\xc3\xads house has a glory, where\r\nthere are true hands, a divine heart, and an honest fame--And the last\r\nhas gane frae us a.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Jeanie, consider your word and plighted faith to me; and would you\r\nundertake such a journey without a man to protect you?--and who should\r\nthat protector be but your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are kind and good, Reuben, and wad take me wi\xc3\xad a\xc3\xad my shame, I\r\ndoubtna. But ye canna but own that this is no time to marry or be given\r\nin marriage. Na, if that suld ever be, it maun be in another and a better\r\nseason.--And, dear Reuben, ye speak of protecting me on my journey--Alas!\r\nwho will protect and take care of you?--your very limbs tremble with\r\nstanding for ten minutes on the floor; how could you undertake a journey\r\nas far as Lunnon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am strong--I am well,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Butler, sinking in his seat\r\ntotally exhausted, \xe2\x80\x9cat least I shall be quite well to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe see, and ye ken, ye maun just let me depart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, after a\r\npause; and then taking his extended hand, and gazing kindly in his face,\r\nshe added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads e\xc3\xaden a grief the mair to me to see you in this way. But\r\nye maun keep up your heart for Jeanie\xc3\xads sake, for if she isna your wife,\r\nshe will never be the wife of living man. And now gie me the paper for\r\nMacCallummore, and bid God speed me on my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something of romance in Jeanie\xc3\xads venturous resolution; yet, on\r\nconsideration, as it seemed impossible to alter it by persuasion, or to\r\ngive her assistance but by advice, Butler, after some farther debate, put\r\ninto her hands the paper she desired, which, with the muster-roll in\r\nwhich it was folded up, were the sole memorials of the stout and\r\nenthusiastic Bible Butler, his grandfather. While Butler sought this\r\ndocument, Jeanie had time to take up his pocket Bible. \xe2\x80\x9cI have marked a\r\nscripture,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she again laid it down, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your kylevine pen,\r\nthat will be useful to us baith. And ye maun tak the trouble, Reuben, to\r\nwrite a\xc3\xad this to my father, for, God help me, I have neither head nor\r\nhand for lang letters at ony time, forby now; and I trust him entirely to\r\nyou, and I trust you will soon be permitted to see him. And, Reuben, when\r\nye do win to the speech o\xc3\xad him, mind a\xc3\xad the auld man\xc3\xads bits o\xc3\xad ways, for\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads sake; and dinna speak o\xc3\xad Latin or English terms to him, for he\xc3\xads\r\no\xc3\xad the auld warld, and downa bide to be fashed wi\xc3\xad them, though I daresay\r\nhe may be wrang. And dinna ye say muckle to him, but set him on speaking\r\nhimself, for he\xc3\xadll bring himsell mair comfort that way. And O, Reuben,\r\nthe poor lassie in yon dungeon!--but I needna bid your kind heart--gie\r\nher what comfort ye can as soon as they will let ye see her--tell\r\nher--But I maunna speak mair about her, for I maunna take leave o\xc3\xad ye\r\nwi\xc3\xad the tear in my ee, for that wouldna be canny.--God bless ye, Reuben!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo avoid so ill an omen she left the room hastily, while her features yet\r\nretained the mournful and affectionate smile which she had compelled them\r\nto wear, in order to support Butler\xc3\xads spirits.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the power of sight, of speech, and of reflection, had\r\nleft him as she disappeared from the room, which she had entered and\r\nretired from so like an apparition. Saddletree, who entered immediately\r\nafterwards, overwhelmed him with questions, which he answered without\r\nunderstanding them, and with legal disquisitions, which conveyed to him\r\nno iota of meaning. At length the learned burgess recollected that there\r\nwas a Baron Court to be, held at Loanhead that day, and though it was\r\nhardly worth while, \xe2\x80\x9che might as weel go to see if there was onything\r\ndoing, as he was acquainted with the baron bailie, who was a decent man,\r\nand would be glad of a word of legal advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo soon as he departed, Butler flew to the Bible, the last book which\r\nJeanie had touched. To his extreme surprise, a paper, containing two or\r\nthree pieces of gold, dropped from the book. With a black-lead pencil,\r\nshe had marked the sixteenth and twenty-fifth verses of the\r\nthirty-seventh Psalm,--\xe2\x80\x9cA little that a righteous man hath, is better\r\nthan the riches of the wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cI have been young and am now old, yet\r\nhave I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their\r\nbread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the affectionate delicacy which shrouded its own\r\ngenerosity under the cover of a providential supply to his wants, he\r\npressed the gold to his lips with more ardour than ever the metal was\r\ngreeted with by a miser. To emulate her devout firmness and confidence\r\nseemed now the pitch of his ambition, and his first task was to write an\r\naccount to David Deans of his daughter\xc3\xads resolution and journey\r\nsouthward. He studied every sentiment, and even every phrase, which he\r\nthought could reconcile the old man to her extraordinary resolution. The\r\neffect which this epistle produced will be hereafter adverted to. Butler\r\ncommitted it to the charge of an honest clown, who had frequent dealings\r\nwith Deans in the sale of his dairy produce, and who readily undertook a\r\njourney to Edinburgh to put the letter into his own hands.*\r\n\r\n* By dint of assiduous research I am enabled to certiorate the reader,\r\nthat the name of this person was Saunders Broadfoot, and that he dealt in\r\nthe wholesome commodity called kirn-milk (_Anglice\xc3\xad,_ butter-milk).--\r\nJ. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cMy native land, good night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                       Lord Byron.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, a journey from Edinburgh to London is a matter at\r\nonce safe, brief, and simple, however inexperienced or unprotected the\r\ntraveller. Numerous coaches of different rates of charge, and as many\r\npackets, are perpetually passing and repassing betwixt the capital of\r\nBritain and her northern sister, so that the most timid or indolent may\r\nexecute such a journey upon a few hours\xc3\xad notice. But it was different in\r\n1737. So slight and infrequent was the intercourse betwixt London and\r\nEdinburgh, that men still alive remember that upon one occasion the mail\r\nfrom the former city arrived at the General Post-Office in Scotland with\r\nonly one letter in it.*\r\n\r\n* The fact is certain. The single epistle was addressed to the principal\r\ndirector of the British Linen Company.\r\n\r\nThe usual mode of travelling was by means of post-horses, the traveller\r\noccupying one, and his guide another, in which manner, by relays of\r\nhorses from stage to stage, the journey might be accomplished in a\r\nwonderfully short time by those who could endure fatigue. To have the\r\nbones shaken to pieces by a constant change of those hacks was a luxury\r\nfor the rich--the poor were under the necessity of using the mode of\r\nconveyance with which nature had provided them.\r\n\r\nWith a strong heart, and a frame patient of fatigue, Jeanie Deans,\r\ntravelling at the rate of twenty miles a-day, and sometimes farther,\r\ntraversed the southern part of Scotland, and advanced as far as Durham.\r\n\r\nHitherto she had been either among her own country-folk, or those to whom\r\nher bare feet and tartan screen were objects too familiar to attract much\r\nattention. But as she advanced, she perceived that both circumstances\r\nexposed her to sarcasm and taunts, which she might otherwise have\r\nescaped; and although in her heart she thought it unkind, and\r\ninhospitable, to sneer at a passing stranger on account of the fashion of\r\nher attire, yet she had the good sense to alter those parts of her dress\r\nwhich attracted ill-natured observation. Her chequed screen was deposited\r\ncarefully in her bundle, and she conformed to the national extravagance\r\nof wearing shoes and stockings for the whole day. She confessed\r\nafterwards, that, \xe2\x80\x9cbesides the wastrife, it was lang or she could walk\r\nsae comfortably with the shoes as without them; but there was often a bit\r\nsaft heather by the road-side, and that helped her weel on.\xe2\x80\x9d The want of\r\nthe screen, which was drawn over the head like a veil, she supplied by a\r\n_bon-grace,_ as she called it; a large straw bonnet like those worn by\r\nthe English maidens when labouring in the fields. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought unco\r\nshame o\xc3\xad mysell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first time I put on a married woman\xc3\xads\r\n_bon-grace,_ and me a single maiden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these changes she had little, as she said, to make \xe2\x80\x9cher kenspeckle\r\nwhen she didna speak,\xe2\x80\x9d but her accent and language drew down on her so\r\nmany jests and gibes, couched in a worse _patois_ by far than her own,\r\nthat she soon found it was her interest to talk as little and as seldom\r\nas possible. She answered, therefore, civil salutations of chance\r\npassengers with a civil courtesy, and chose, with anxious circumspection,\r\nsuch places of repose as looked at once most decent and sequestered. She\r\nfound the common people of England, although inferior in courtesy to\r\nstrangers, such as was then practised in her own more unfrequented\r\ncountry, yet, upon the whole, by no means deficient in the real duties of\r\nhospitality. She readily obtained food, and shelter, and protection at a\r\nvery moderate rate, which sometimes the generosity of mine host\r\naltogether declined, with a blunt apology,--\xe2\x80\x9cThee hast a long way afore\r\nthee, lass; and I\xc3\xadse ne\xc3\xader take penny out o\xc3\xad a single woman\xc3\xads purse; it\xc3\xads\r\nthe best friend thou can have on the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt often happened, too, that mine hostess was struck with \xe2\x80\x9cthe tidy, nice\r\nScotch body,\xe2\x80\x9d and procured her an escort, or a cast in a waggon, for some\r\npart of the way, or gave her a useful advice and recommendation\r\nrespecting her resting-places.\r\n\r\nAt York our pilgrim stopped for the best part of a day, partly to recruit\r\nher strength,--partly because she had the good luck to obtain a lodging\r\nin an inn kept by a countrywoman,--partly to indite two letters to her\r\nfather and Reuben Butler; an operation of some little difficulty, her\r\nhabits being by no means those of literary composition. That to her\r\nfather was in the following words.--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Father,--I make my present pilgrimage more heavy and burdensome,\r\nthrough the sad occasion to reflect that it is without your knowledge,\r\nwhich, God knows, was far contrary to my heart; for Scripture says, that\r\n\xc3\xabthe vow of the daughter should not be binding without the consent of the\r\nfather,\xc3\xad wherein it may be I have been guilty to tak this wearie journey\r\nwithout your consent. Nevertheless, it was borne in upon my mind that I\r\nshould be an instrument to help my poor sister in this extremity of\r\nneedcessity, otherwise I wad not, for wealth or for world\xc3\xads gear, or for\r\nthe haill lands of Da\xc3\xadkeith and Lugton, have done the like o\xc3\xad this,\r\nwithout your free will and knowledge. Oh, dear father, as ye wad desire a\r\nblessing on my journey, and upon your household, speak a word or write a\r\nline of comfort to yon poor prisoner. If she has sinned, she has sorrowed\r\nand suffered, and ye ken better than me, that we maun forgie others, as\r\nwe pray to be forgien. Dear father, forgive my saying this muckle, for it\r\ndoth not become a young head to instruct grey hairs; but I am sae far\r\nfrae ye, that my heart yearns to ye a\xc3\xad, and fain wad I hear that ye had\r\nforgien her trespass, and sae I nae doubt say mair than may become me.\r\nThe folk here are civil, and, like the barbarians unto the holy apostle,\r\nhae shown me much kindness; and there are a sort of chosen people in the\r\nland, for they hae some kirks without organs that are like ours, and are\r\ncalled meeting-houses, where the minister preaches without a gown. But\r\nmost of the country are prelatists, whilk is awfu\xc3\xad to think; and I saw\r\ntwa men that were ministers following hunds, as bauld as Roslin or\r\nDriden, the young Laird of Loup-the-dike, or ony wild gallant in Lothian.\r\nA sorrowfa\xc3\xad sight to behold! Oh, dear father, may a blessing be with your\r\ndown-lying and up-rising, and remember in your prayers your affectionate\r\ndaughter to command,\r\n                                                      \xe2\x80\x9cJean Deans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA postscript bore, \xe2\x80\x9cI learned from a decent woman, a grazier\xc3\xads widow,\r\nthat they hae a cure for the muir-ill in Cumberland, whilk is ane pint,\r\nas they ca\xc3\xadt, of yill, whilk is a dribble in comparison of our gawsie\r\nScots pint, and hardly a mutchkin, boiled wi\xc3\xad sope and hartshorn draps,\r\nand toomed doun the creature\xc3\xads throat wi\xc3\xad ane whorn. Ye might try it on\r\nthe bauson-faced year-auld quey; an it does nae gude, it can do nae ill.--\r\nShe was a kind woman, and seemed skeely about horned beasts. When I\r\nreach Lunnon, I intend to gang to our cousin Mrs. Glass, the tobacconist,\r\nat the sign o\xc3\xad the Thistle, wha is so ceevil as to send you down your\r\nspleuchan-fu\xc3\xad anes a year; and as she must be well kend in Lunnon, I\r\ndoubt not easily to find out where she lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeing seduced into betraying our heroine\xc3\xads confidence thus far, we will\r\nstretch our communication a step beyond, and impart to the reader her\r\nletter to her lover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Reuben Butler,--Hoping this will find you better, this comes to say,\r\nthat I have reached this great town safe, and am not wearied with\r\nwalking, but the better for it. And I have seen many things which I trust\r\nto tell you one day, also the muckle kirk of this place; and all around\r\nthe city are mills, whilk havena muckle wheels nor mill-dams, but gang by\r\nthe wind--strange to behold. Ane miller asked me to gang in and see it\r\nwork, but I wad not, for I am not come to the south to make acquaintance\r\nwith strangers. I keep the straight road, and just beck if onybody speaks\r\nto me ceevilly, and answers naebody with the tong but women of my ain\r\nsect. I wish, Mr. Butler, I kend onything that wad mak ye weel, for they\r\nhae mair medicines in this town of York than wad cure a\xc3\xad Scotland, and\r\nsurely some of them wad be gude for your complaints. If ye had a kindly\r\nmotherly body to nurse ye, and no to let ye waste yoursell wi\xc3\xad\r\nreading--whilk ye read mair than eneugh wi\xc3\xad the bairns in the\r\nschule--and to gie ye warm milk in the morning, I wad be mair easy for\r\nye. Dear Mr. Butler, keep a good heart, for we are in the hands of Ane\r\nthat kens better what is gude for us than we ken what is for oursells. I\r\nhae nae doubt to do that for which I am come--I canna doubt it--I winna\r\nthink to doubt it--because, if I haena full assurance, how shall I bear\r\nmyself with earnest entreaties in the great folk\xc3\xads presence? But to ken\r\nthat ane\xc3\xads purpose is right, and to make their heart strong, is the way\r\nto get through the warst day\xc3\xads darg. The bairns\xc3\xad rime says, the warst\r\nblast of the borrowing days* couldna kill the three silly poor hog-lams.\r\n\r\n* The last three days of March, old style, are called the Borrowing Days;\r\nfor, as they are remarked to be unusually stormy, it is feigned that\r\nMarch had borrowed them from April, to extend the sphere of his rougher\r\nsway. The rhyme on the subject is quoted in the glossary to Leyden\xc3\xads\r\nedition of the \xe2\x80\x9cComplaynt of Scotland\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n               [March said to Aperill,\r\n                   I see three hogs upon a hill,\r\n                A young sheep before it has lost its first fleece.\r\n                   But when the borrowed days were gane\r\n                The three silly hogs came hirplin hame.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it be God\xc3\xads pleasure, we that are sindered in sorrow may meet\r\nagain in joy, even on this hither side of Jordan. I dinna bid ye mind\r\nwhat I said at our partin\xc3\xad anent my poor father, and that misfortunate\r\nlassie, for I ken you will do sae for the sake of Christian charity,\r\nwhilk is mair than the entreaties of her that is your servant to command,\r\n\r\n                                                    \xe2\x80\x9cJeanie Deans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis letter also had a postscript. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Reuben, If ye think that it wad\r\nhae been right for me to have said mair and kinder things to ye, just\r\nthink that I hae written sae, since I am sure that I wish a\xc3\xad that is kind\r\nand right to ye and by ye. Ye will think I am turned waster, for I wear\r\nclean hose and shoon every day; but it\xc3\xads the fashion here for decent\r\nbodies and ilka land has it\xc3\xads ain landlaw. Ower and aboon a\xc3\xad, if laughing\r\ndays were e\xc3\xader to come back again till us, ye wad laugh weel to see my\r\nround face at the far end of a strae _bon-grace,_ that looks as muckle\r\nand round as the middell aisle in Libberton Kirk. But it sheds the sun\r\nweel aff, and keeps uncivil folk frae staring as if ane were a worrycow.\r\nI sall tell ye by writ how I come on wi\xc3\xad the Duke of Argyle, when I won\r\nup to Lunnon. Direct a line, to say how ye are, to me, to the charge of\r\nMrs. Margaret Glass, tobacconist, at the sign of the Thistle, Lunnon,\r\nwhilk, if it assures me of your health, will make my mind sae muckle\r\neasier. Excuse bad spelling and writing, as I have ane ill pen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe orthography of these epistles may seem to the southron to require a\r\nbetter apology than the letter expresses, though a bad pen was the excuse\r\nof a certain Galwegian laird for bad spelling; but, on behalf of the\r\nheroine, I would have them to know, that, thanks to the care of Butler,\r\nJeanie Deans wrote and spelled fifty times better than half the women of\r\nrank in Scotland at that period, whose strange orthography and singular\r\ndiction form the strongest contrast to the good sense which their\r\ncorrespondence usually intimates.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, in the tenor of these epistles, Jeanie expressed, perhaps,\r\nmore hopes, a firmer courage, and better spirits, than she actually felt.\r\nBut this was with the amiable idea of relieving her father and lover from\r\napprehensions on her account, which she was sensible must greatly add to\r\ntheir other troubles. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they think me weel, and like to do weel,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe poor pilgrim to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cmy father will be kinder to Effie, and\r\nButler will be kinder to himself. For I ken weel that they will think\r\nmair o\xc3\xad me than I do o\xc3\xad mysell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, she sealed her letters carefully, and put them into the\r\npost-office with her own hand, after many inquiries concerning the time\r\nin which they were likely to reach Edinburgh. When this duty was\r\nperformed, she readily accepted her landlady\xc3\xads pressing invitation to\r\ndine with her, and remain till the next morning. The hostess, as we have\r\nsaid, was her countrywoman, and the eagerness with which Scottish people\r\nmeet, communicate, and, to the extent of their power, assist each other,\r\nalthough it is often objected to us as a prejudice and narrowness of\r\nsentiment, seems, on the contrary, to arise from a most justifiable and\r\nhonourable feeling of patriotism, combined with a conviction, which, if\r\nundeserved, would long since have been confuted by experience, that the\r\nhabits and principles of the nation are a sort of guarantee for the\r\ncharacter of the individual. At any rate, if the extensive influence of\r\nthis national partiality be considered as an additional tie, binding man\r\nto man, and calling forth the good offices of such as can render them to\r\nthe countryman who happens to need them, we think it must be found to\r\nexceed, as an active and efficient motive, to generosity, that more\r\nimpartial and wider principle of general benevolence, which we have\r\nsometimes seen pleaded as an excuse for assisting no individual whatever.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bickerton, lady of the ascendant of the Seven Stars, in the\r\nCastle-gate, York, was deeply infected with the unfortunate prejudices of\r\nher country. Indeed, she displayed so much kindness to Jeanie Deans\r\n(because she herself, being a Merse woman, _marched_ with Mid-Lothian, in\r\nwhich Jeanie was born), showed such motherly regard to her, and such\r\nanxiety for her farther progress, that Jeanie thought herself safe,\r\nthough by temper sufficiently cautious, in communicating her whole story\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bickerton raised her hands and eyes at the recital, and exhibited\r\nmuch wonder and pity. But she also gave some effectual good advice.\r\n\r\nShe required to know the strength of Jeanie\xc3\xads purse, reduced by her\r\ndeposit at Liberton, and the necessary expense of her journey, to about\r\nfifteen pounds. \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould do very well, providing she\r\nwould carry it a\xc3\xad safe to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafe!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadse warrant my carrying it safe, bating the\r\nneedful expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but highwaymen, lassie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bickerton; \xe2\x80\x9cfor ye are come into\r\na more civilised, that is to say, a more roguish country than the north,\r\nand how ye are to get forward, I do not profess to know. If ye could wait\r\nhere eight days, our waggons would go up, and I would recommend you to\r\nJoe Broadwheel, who would see you safe to the Swan and two Necks. And\r\ndinna sneeze at Joe, if he should be for drawing up wi\xc3\xad you\xe2\x80\x9d (continued\r\nMrs. Bickerton, her acquired English mingling with her national or\r\noriginal dialect), \xe2\x80\x9che\xc3\xads a handy boy, and a wanter, and no lad better\r\nthought o\xc3\xad on the road; and the English make good husbands enough,\r\nwitness my poor man, Moses Bickerton, as is i\xc3\xad the kirkyard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie hastened to say, that she could not possibly wait for the setting\r\nforth of Joe Broadwheel; being internally by no means gratified with the\r\nidea of becoming the object of his attention during the journey,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, lass,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the good landlady, \xe2\x80\x9cthen thou must pickle in\r\nthine ain poke-nook, and buckle thy girdle thine ain gate. But take my\r\nadvice, and hide thy gold in thy stays, and keep a piece or two and some\r\nsilver, in case thou be\xc3\xadst spoke withal; for there\xc3\xads as wud lads haunt\r\nwithin a day\xc3\xads walk from hence, as on the braes of Doune in Perthshire.\r\nAnd, lass, thou maunna gang staring through Lunnon, asking wha kens Mrs.\r\nGlass at the sign o\xc3\xad the Thistle; marry, they would laugh thee to scorn.\r\nBut gang thou to this honest man,\xe2\x80\x9d and she put a direction into Jeanie\xc3\xads\r\nhand, \xe2\x80\x9che kens maist part of the sponsible Scottish folk in the city, and\r\nhe will find out your friend for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie took the little introductory letter with sincere thanks; but,\r\nsomething alarmed on the subject of the highway robbers, her mind\r\nrecurred to what Ratcliffe had mentioned to her, and briefly relating the\r\ncircumstances which placed a document so extraordinary in her hands, she\r\nput the paper he had given her into the hand of Mrs. Bickerton.\r\n\r\nThe Lady of the Seven Stars did not indeed ring a bell, because such was\r\nnot the fashion of the time, but she whistled on a silver call, which was\r\nhung by her side, and a tight serving-maid entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Dick Ostler to come here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bickerton.\r\n\r\nDick Ostler accordingly made his appearance;--a queer, knowing, shambling\r\nanimal, with a hatchet-face, a squint, a game-arm, and a limp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDick Ostler,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bickerton, in a tone of authority that showed\r\nshe was (at least by adoption) Yorkshire too, \xe2\x80\x9cthou knowest most people\r\nand most things o\xc3\xad the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEye, eye, God help me, mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, shrugging his shoulders\r\nbetwixt a repentant and a knowing expression--\xe2\x80\x9cEye! I ha\xc3\xad know\xc3\xadd a thing\r\nor twa i\xc3\xad ma day, mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked sharp and laughed--looked grave\r\nand sighed, as one who was prepared to take the matter either way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKenst thou this wee bit paper amang the rest, man?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bickerton,\r\nhanding him the protection which Ratcliffe had given Jeanie Deans.\r\n\r\nWhen Dick had looked at the paper, he winked with one eye, extended his\r\ngrotesque mouth from ear to ear, like a navigable canal, scratched his\r\nhead powerfully, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cKen!--ay--maybe we ken summat, an it\r\nwerena for harm to him, mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bickerton; \xe2\x80\x9conly a dram of Hollands to\r\nthyself, man, an thou wilt speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick, giving the head-band of his breeches a knowing\r\nhoist with one hand, and kicking out one foot behind him to accommodate\r\nthe adjustment of that important habiliment, \xe2\x80\x9cI dares to say the pass\r\nwill be kend weel eneugh on the road, an that be all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what sort of a lad was he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bickerton, winking to Jeanie,\r\nas proud of her knowing Ostler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what ken I?--Jim the Rat--why he was Cock o\xc3\xad the North within this\r\ntwelmonth--he and Scotch Wilson, Handle Dandie, as they called him--but\r\nhe\xc3\xads been out o\xc3\xad this country a while, as I rackon; but ony gentleman, as\r\nkeeps the road o\xc3\xad this side Stamford, will respect Jim\xc3\xads pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout asking farther questions, the landlady filled Dick Ostler a\r\nbumper of Hollands. He ducked with his head and shoulders, scraped with\r\nhis more advanced hoof, bolted the alcohol, to use the learned phrase,\r\nand withdrew to his own domains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would advise thee, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bickerton, \xe2\x80\x9can thou meetest with\r\nugly customers o\xc3\xad the road, to show them this bit paper, for it will\r\nserve thee, assure thyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA neat little supper concluded the evening. The exported Scotswoman, Mrs.\r\nBickerton by name, ate heartily of one or two seasoned dishes, drank some\r\nsound old ale, and a glass of stiff negus; while she gave Jeanie a\r\nhistory of her gout, admiring how it was possible that she, whose fathers\r\nand mothers for many generations had been farmers in Lammermuir, could\r\nhave come by a disorder so totally unknown to them. Jeanie did not choose\r\nto offend her friendly landlady, by speaking her mind on the probable\r\norigin of this complaint; but she thought on the flesh-pots of Egypt,\r\nand, in spite of all entreaties to better fare, made her evening meal\r\nupon vegetables, with a glass of fair water.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bickerton assured her, that the acceptance of any reckoning was\r\nentirely out of the question, furnished her with credentials to her\r\ncorrespondent in London, and to several inns upon the road where she had\r\nsome influence or interest, reminded her of the precautions she should\r\nadopt for concealing her money, and as she was to depart early in the\r\nmorning, took leave of her very affectionately, taking her word that she\r\nwould visit her on her return to Scotland, and tell her how she had\r\nmanaged, and that summum bonum for a gossip, \xe2\x80\x9call how and about it.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nJeanie faithfully promised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTH.\r\n\r\n              And Need and Misery, Vice and Danger, bind,\r\n              In sad alliance, each degraded mind.\r\n\r\nAs our traveller set out early on the ensuing morning to prosecute her\r\njourney, and was in the act of leaving the innyard, Dick Ostler, who\r\neither had risen early or neglected to go to bed, either circumstance\r\nbeing equally incident to his calling, hollowed out after her,--\xe2\x80\x9cThe top\r\nof the morning to you, Moggie. Have a care o\xc3\xad Gunderby Hill, young one.\r\nRobin Hood\xc3\xads dead and gwone, but there be takers yet in the vale of\r\nBever. Jeanie looked at him as if to request a farther explanation, but,\r\nwith a leer, a shuffle, and a shrug, inimitable (unless by Emery*), Dick\r\nturned again to the raw-boned steed which he was currying, and sung as he\r\nemployed the comb and brush,--\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cRobin Hood was a yeoman right good,\r\n                    And his bow was of trusty yew;\r\n                And if Robin said stand on the king\xc3\xads lea-land,\r\n                    Pray, why should not we say so too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* [John Emery, an eminent comedian, played successfully at Covent Garden\r\nTheatre between 1798 and 1820. Among his characters, were those of Dandie\r\nDinmont in _Guy Mannering,_ Dougal in _Rob Roy,_ and Ratcliffe in the\r\nHeart of _Mid-Lothian._]\r\n\r\nJeanie pursued her journey without farther inquiry, for there was nothing\r\nin Dick\xc3\xads manner that inclined her to prolong their conference. A painful\r\nday\xc3\xads journey brought her to Ferrybridge, the best inn, then and since,\r\nupon the great northern road; and an introduction from Mrs. Bickerton,\r\nadded to her own simple and quiet manners, so propitiated the landlady of\r\nthe Swan in her favour, that the good dame procured her the convenient\r\naccommodation of a pillion and post-horse then returning to Tuxford, so\r\nthat she accomplished, upon the second day after leaving York, the\r\nlongest journey she had yet made. She was a good deal fatigued by a mode\r\nof travelling to which she was less accustomed than to walking, and it\r\nwas considerably later than usual on the ensuing morning that she felt\r\nherself able to resume her pilgrimage. At noon the hundred-armed Trent,\r\nand the blackened ruins of Newark Castle, demolished in the great civil\r\nwar, lay before her. It may easily be supposed, that Jeanie had no\r\ncuriosity to make antiquarian researches, but, entering the town, went\r\nstraight to the inn to which she had been directed at Ferrybridge. While\r\nshe procured some refreshment, she observed the girl who brought it to\r\nher, looked at her several times with fixed and peculiar interest, and at\r\nlast, to her infinite surprise, inquired if her name was not Deans, and\r\nif she was not a Scotchwoman, going to London upon justice business.\r\nJeanie, with all her simplicity of character, had some of the caution of\r\nher country, and, according to Scottish universal custom, she answered\r\nthe question by another, requesting the girl would tell her why she asked\r\nthese questions?\r\n\r\nThe Maritornes of the Saracen\xc3\xads Head, Newark, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo women had\r\npassed that morning, who had made inquiries after one Jeanie Deans,\r\ntravelling to London on such an errand, and could scarce be persuaded\r\nthat she had not passed on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch surprised and somewhat alarmed (for what is inexplicable is usually\r\nalarming), Jeanie questioned the wench about the particular appearance of\r\nthese two women, but could only learn that the one was aged, and the\r\nother young; that the latter was the taller, and that the former spoke\r\nmost, and seemed to maintain an authority over her companion, and that\r\nboth spoke with the Scottish accent.\r\n\r\nThis conveyed no information whatever, and with an indescribable\r\npresentiment of evil designed towards her, Jeanie adopted the resolution\r\nof taking post-horses for the next stage. In this, however, she could not\r\nbe gratified; some accidental circumstances had occasioned what is called\r\na run upon the road, and the landlord could not accommodate her with a\r\nguide and horses. After waiting some time, in hopes that a pair of horses\r\nthat had gone southward would return in time for her use, she at length,\r\nfeeling ashamed at her own pusillanimity, resolved to prosecute her\r\njourney in her usual manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all plain road,\xe2\x80\x9d she was assured, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept a high mountain called\r\nGunnerby Hill, about three miles from Grantham, which was her stage for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadm glad to hear there\xc3\xads a hill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cfor baith my sight and\r\nmy very feet are weary o\xc3\xad sic tracts o\xc3\xad level ground--it looks a\xc3\xad the way\r\nbetween this and York as if a\xc3\xad the land had been trenched and levelled,\r\nwhilk is very wearisome to my Scotch een. When I lost sight of a muckle\r\nblue hill they ca\xc3\xad Ingleboro\xc3\xad, I thought I hadna a friend left in this\r\nstrange land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for the matter of that, young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said mine host, \xe2\x80\x9can you be so\r\nfond o\xc3\xad hill, I carena an thou couldst carry Gunnerby away with thee in\r\nthy lap, for it\xc3\xads a murder to post-horses. But here\xc3\xads to thy journey, and\r\nmayst thou win well through it, for thou is a bold and a canny lass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took a powerful pull at a solemn tankard of home-brewed\r\nale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope there is nae bad company on the road, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, when it\xc3\xads clean without them I\xc3\xadll thatch Groby pool wi\xc3\xad pancakes.\r\nBut there arena sae mony now; and since they hae lost Jim the Rat, they\r\nhold together no better than the men of Marsham when they lost their\r\ncommon. Take a drop ere thou goest,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, offering her the\r\ntankard; \xe2\x80\x9cthou wilt get naething at night save Grantham gruel, nine grots\r\nand a gallon of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie courteously declined the tankard, and inquired what was her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clawing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy lawing! Heaven help thee, wench! what ca\xc3\xadst thou that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is--I was wanting to ken what was to pay,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay? Lord help thee!--why nought, woman--we hae drawn no liquor but a\r\ngill o\xc3\xad beer, and the Saracen\xc3\xads Head can spare a mouthful o\xc3\xad meat to a\r\nstranger like o\xc3\xad thee, that cannot speak Christian language. So here\xc3\xads to\r\nthee once more. The same again, quoth Mark of Bellgrave,\xe2\x80\x9d and he took\r\nanother profound pull at the tankard.\r\n\r\nThe travellers who have visited Newark more lately, will not fail to\r\nremember the remarkably civil and gentlemanly manners of the person who\r\nnow keeps the principal inn there, and may find some amusement in\r\ncontrasting them with those of his more rough predecessor. But we believe\r\nit will be found that the polish has worn off none of the real worth of\r\nthe metal.\r\n\r\nTaking leave of her Lincolnshire Gaius, Jeanie resumed her solitary walk,\r\nand was somewhat alarmed when evening and twilight overtook her in the\r\nopen ground which extends to the foot of Gunnerby Hill, and is\r\nintersected with patches of copse and with swampy spots. The extensive\r\ncommons on the north road, most of which are now enclosed, and in general\r\na relaxed state of police, exposed the traveller to a highway robbery in\r\na degree which is now unknown, except in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nmetropolis. Aware of this circumstance, Jeanie mended her pace when she\r\nheard the trampling of a horse behind, and instinctively drew to one side\r\nof the road, as if to allow as much room for the rider to pass as might\r\nbe possible. When the animal came up, she found that it was bearing two\r\nwomen, the one placed on a side-saddle, the other on a pillion behind\r\nher, as may still occasionally be seen in England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA braw good-night to ye, Jeanie Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d said the foremost female as the\r\nhorse passed our heroine; \xe2\x80\x9cWhat think ye o\xc3\xad yon bonny hill yonder,\r\nlifting its brow to the moon? Trow ye yon\xc3\xads the gate to heaven, that ye\r\nare sae fain of?--maybe we will win there the night yet, God sain us,\r\nthough our minny here\xc3\xads rather dreigh in the upgang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker kept changing her seat in the saddle, and half stopping the\r\nhorse as she brought her body round, while the woman that sate behind her\r\non the pillion seemed to urge her on, in words which Jeanie heard but\r\nimperfectly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHand your tongue, ye moon-raised b----! what is your business with ----,\r\nor with heaven or hell either?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroth, mither, no muckle wi\xc3\xad heaven, I doubt, considering wha I carry\r\nahint me--and as for hell, it will fight its ain battle at its ain time,\r\nI\xc3\xadse be bound.--Come, naggie, trot awa, man, an as thou wert a\r\nbroomstick, for a witch rides thee--\r\n\r\n      With my curtch on my foot, and my shoe on my hand,\r\n      I glance like the wildfire through brugh and through land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tramp of the horse, and the increasing distance, drowned the rest of\r\nher song, but Jeanie heard for some time the inarticulate sounds ring\r\nalong the waste.\r\n\r\nOur pilgrim remained stupified with undefined apprehensions. The being\r\nnamed by her name in so wild a manner, and in a strange country, without\r\nfarther explanation or communing, by a person who thus strangely flitted\r\nforward and disappeared before her, came near to the supernatural sounds\r\nin Comus:--\r\n\r\n             The airy tongues, which syllable men\xc3\xads names\r\n             On sands, and shores, and desert wildernesses.\r\n\r\nAnd although widely different in features, deportment, and rank, from the\r\nLady of that enchanting masque, the continuation of the passage may be\r\nhappily applied to Jeanie Deans upon this singular alarm:--\r\n\r\n              These thoughts may startle well, but not astound\r\n              The virtuous mind, that ever walks attended\r\n              By a strong siding champion--Conscience.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was, with the recollection of the affectionate and dutiful\r\nerrand on which she was engaged, her right, if such a word could be\r\napplicable, to expect protection in a task so meritorious. She had not\r\nadvanced much farther, with a mind calmed by these reflections, when she\r\nwas disturbed by a new and more instant subject of terror. Two men, who\r\nhad been lurking among some copse, started up as she advanced, and met\r\nher on the road in a menacing manner. \xe2\x80\x9cStand and deliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of\r\nthem, a short stout fellow, in a smock-frock, such as are worn by\r\nwaggoners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, a tall thin figure, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not understand the\r\nwords of action.--Your money, my precious, or your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have but very little money, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Jeanie, tendering\r\nthat portion which she had separated from her principal stock, and kept\r\napart for such an emergency; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you are resolved to have it, to be\r\nsure you must have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis won\xc3\xadt do, my girl. D--n me, if it shall pass!\xe2\x80\x9d said the shorter\r\nruffian; \xe2\x80\x9cdo ye think gentlemen are to hazard their lives on the road to\r\nbe cheated in this way? We\xc3\xadll have every farthing you have got, or we\r\nwill strip you to the skin, curse me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion, who seemed to have something like compassion for the\r\nhorror which Jeanie\xc3\xads countenance now expressed, said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Tom, this\r\nis one of the precious sisters, and we\xc3\xadll take her word, for once,\r\nwithout putting her to the stripping proof--Hark ye, my lass, if ye look\r\nup to heaven, and say, this is the last penny you have about ye, why,\r\nhang it, we\xc3\xadll let you pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not free,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cto say what I have about me,\r\ngentlemen, for there\xc3\xads life and death depends on my journey; but if you\r\nleave me as much as finds me bread and water, I\xc3\xadll be satisfied, and\r\nthank you, and pray for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD--n your prayers!\xe2\x80\x9d said the shorter fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xc3\xads a coin that won\xc3\xadt\r\npass with us;\xe2\x80\x9d and at the same time made a motion to seize her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d Ratcliffe\xc3\xads pass suddenly occurring to her; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps\r\nyou know this paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil is she after now, Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d said the more savage\r\nruffian--\xe2\x80\x9cDo you look at it, for, d--n me if I could read it if it were\r\nfor the benefit of my clergy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a jark from Jim Ratcliffe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the taller, having looked at\r\nthe bit of paper. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wench must pass by our cutter\xc3\xads law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say no,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his companion; \xe2\x80\x9cRat has left the lay, and turned\r\nbloodhound, they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may need a good turn from him all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said the taller ruffian\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are we to do then?\xe2\x80\x9d said the shorter man--\xe2\x80\x9cWe promised, you\r\nknow, to strip the wench, and send her begging back to her own beggarly\r\ncountry, and now you are for letting her go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not say that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other fellow, and whispered to his\r\ncompanion, who replied, \xe2\x80\x9cBe alive about it then, and don\xc3\xadt keep\r\nchattering till some travellers come up to nab us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must follow us off the road, young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the taller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of God!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cas you were born of woman,\r\ndinna ask me to leave the road! rather take all I have in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil is the wench afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other fellow. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell\r\nyou you shall come to no harm; but if you will not leave the road and\r\ncome with us, d--n me, but I\xc3\xadll beat your brains out where you stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a rough bear, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said his companion.--\xe2\x80\x9cAn ye touch her, I\xc3\xadll\r\ngive ye a shake by the collar shall make the Leicester beans rattle in\r\nthy guts.--Never mind him, girl; I will not allow him to lay a finger on\r\nyou, if you walk quietly on with us; but if you keep jabbering there,\r\nd--n me, but I\xc3\xadll leave him to settle it with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis threat conveyed all that is terrible to the imagination of poor\r\nJeanie, who saw in him that \xe2\x80\x9cwas of milder mood\xe2\x80\x9d her only protection from\r\nthe most brutal treatment. She, therefore, not only followed him, but\r\neven held him by the sleeve, lest he should escape from her; and the\r\nfellow, hardened as he was, seemed something touched by these marks of\r\nconfidence, and repeatedly assured her, that he would suffer her to\r\nreceive no harm.\r\n\r\nThey conducted their prisoner in a direction leading more and more from\r\nthe public road, but she observed that they kept a sort of track or\r\nby-path, which relieved her from part of her apprehensions, which would\r\nhave been greatly increased had they not seemed to follow a determined\r\nand ascertained route. After about half-an-hour\xc3\xads walking, all three in\r\nprofound silence, they approached an old barn, which stood on the edge of\r\nsome cultivated ground, but remote from everything like a habitation. It\r\nwas itself, however, tenanted, for there was light in the windows.\r\n\r\nOne of the footpads scratched at the door, which was opened by a female,\r\nand they entered with their unhappy prisoner. An old woman, who was\r\npreparing food by the assistance of a stifling fire of lighted charcoal,\r\nasked them, in the name of the devil, what they brought the wench there\r\nfor, and why they did not strip her and turn her abroad on the common?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Mother Blood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall man, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xc3\xadll do what\xc3\xads right to\r\noblige you, and we\xc3\xadll do no more; we are bad enough, but not such as you\r\nwould make us,--devils incarnate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has got a jark from Jim Ratcliffe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the short fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nFrank here won\xc3\xadt hear of our putting her through the mill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that I will not, by G--d!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Frank; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if old Mother Blood\r\ncould keep her here for a little while, or send her back to Scotland,\r\nwithout hurting her, why, I see no harm in that--not I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll tell you what, Frank Levitt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cif you call me\r\nMother Blood again, I\xc3\xadll paint this gully\xe2\x80\x9d (and she held a knife up as if\r\nabout to make good her threat) \xe2\x80\x9cin the best blood in your body, my bonny\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe price of ointment must be up in the north,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank, \xe2\x80\x9cthat puts\r\nMother Blood so much out of humour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a moment\xc3\xads hesitation the fury darted her knife at him with the\r\nvengeful dexterity of a wild Indian. As he was on his guard, he avoided\r\nthe missile by a sudden motion of his head, but it whistled past his ear,\r\nand stuck deep in the clay wall of a partition behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the robber, seizing her by both wrists, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall teach you who\xc3\xads master;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying, he forced the hag backwards\r\nby main force, who strove vehemently until she sunk on a bunch of straw,\r\nand then, letting go her hands, he held up his finger towards her in the\r\nmenacing posture by which a maniac is intimidated by his keeper. It\r\nappeared to produce the desired effect; for she did not attempt to rise\r\nfrom the seat on which he had placed her, or to resume any measures of\r\nactual violence, but wrung her withered hands with impotent rage, and\r\nbrayed and howled like a demoniac.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will keep my promise with you, you old devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank; \xe2\x80\x9cthe wench\r\nshall not go forward on the London road, but I will not have you touch a\r\nhair of her head, if it were but for your insolence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis intimation seemed to compose in some degree the vehement passion of\r\nthe old hag; and while her exclamations and howls sunk into a low,\r\nmaundering, growling tone of voice, another personage was added to this\r\nsingular party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Frank Levitt,\xe2\x80\x9d said this new-comer, who entered with a hop, step,\r\nand jump, which at once conveyed her from the door into the centre of the\r\nparty, \xe2\x80\x9cwere ye killing our mother? or were ye cutting the grunter\xc3\xads\r\nweasand that Tam brought in this morning? or have ye been reading your\r\nprayers backward, to bring up my auld acquaintance the deil amang ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone of the speaker was so particular, that Jeanie immediately\r\nrecognised the woman who had rode foremost of the pair which passed her\r\njust before she met the robbers; a circumstance which greatly increased\r\nher terror, as it served to show that the mischief designed against her\r\nwas premeditated, though by whom, or for what cause, she was totally at a\r\nloss to conjecture. From the style of her conversation, the reader also\r\nmay probably acknowledge in this female an old acquaintance in the\r\nearlier part of our narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut, ye mad devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, whom she had disturbed in the middle of a\r\ndraught of some liquor with which he had found means of accommodating\r\nhimself; \xe2\x80\x9cbetwixt your Bess of Bedlam pranks, and your dam\xc3\xads frenzies, a\r\nman might live quieter in the devil\xc3\xads ken than here.\xe2\x80\x9d--And he again\r\nresumed the broken jug out of which he had been drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wha\xc3\xads this o\xc3\xadt?\xe2\x80\x9d said the mad woman, dancing up to Jeanie Deans,\r\nwho, although in great terror, yet watched the scene with a resolution to\r\nlet nothing pass unnoticed which might be serviceable in assisting her to\r\nescape, or informing her as to the true nature of her situation, and the\r\ndanger attending it,--\xe2\x80\x9cWha\xc3\xads this o\xc3\xadt?\xe2\x80\x9d again exclaimed Madge Wildfire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDouce Davie Deans, the auld doited whig body\xc3\xads daughter, in a gipsy\xc3\xads\r\nbarn, and the night setting in? This is a sight for sair een!--Eh, sirs,\r\nthe falling off o\xc3\xad the godly!--and the t\xc3\xadother sister\xc3\xads in the Tolbooth\r\nof Edinburgh; I am very sorry for her, for my share--it\xc3\xads my mother\r\nwusses ill to her, and no me--though maybe I hae as muckle cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark ye, Madge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the taller ruffian, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have not such a touch of\r\nthe devil\xc3\xads blood as the hag your mother, who may be his dam for what I\r\nknow--take this young woman to your kennel, and do not let the devil\r\nenter, though he should ask in God\xc3\xads name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu ay; that I will, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, taking hold of Jeanie by the\r\narm, and pulling her along; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it\xc3\xads no for decent Christian young\r\nleddies, like her and me, to be keeping the like o\xc3\xad you and Tyburn Tam\r\ncompany at this time o\xc3\xad night. Sae gude-e\xc3\xaden t\xc3\xadye, sirs, and mony o\xc3\xad\r\nthem; and may ye a\xc3\xad sleep till the hangman wauken ye, and then it will be\r\nweel for the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then, as her wild fancy seemed suddenly to prompt her, walked\r\ndemurely towards her mother, who, seated by the charcoal fire, with the\r\nreflection of the red light on her withered and distorted features marked\r\nby every evil passion, seemed the very picture of Hecate at her infernal\r\nrites; and, suddenly dropping on her knees, said, with the manner of a\r\nsix years\xc3\xad old child, \xe2\x80\x9cMammie, hear me say my prayers before I go to bed,\r\nand say God bless my bonny face, as ye used to do lang syne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deil flay the hide o\xc3\xad it to sole his brogues wi\xc3\xad!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\nlady, aiming a buffet at the supplicant, in answer to her duteous\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nThe blow missed Madge, who, being probably acquainted by experience with\r\nthe mode in which her mother was wont to confer her maternal\r\nbenedictions, slipt out of arm\xc3\xads length with great dexterity and\r\nquickness. The hag then started up, and, seizing a pair of old\r\nfire-tongs, would have amended her motion, by beating out the brains\r\neither of her daughter or Jeanie (she did not seem greatly to care\r\nwhich), when her hand was once more arrested by the man whom they called\r\nFrank Levitt, who, seizing her by the shoulder, flung her from him with\r\ngreat violence, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Mother Damnable--again, and in my\r\nsovereign presence!--Hark ye, Madge of Bedlam! get to your hole with your\r\nplayfellow, or we shall have the devil to pay here, and nothing to pay\r\nhim with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadge took Levitt\xc3\xads advice, retreating as fast as she could, and dragging\r\nJeanie along with her into a sort of recess, partitioned off from the\r\nrest of the barn, and filled with straw, from which it appeared that it\r\nwas intended for the purpose of slumber. The moonlight shone, through an\r\nopen hole, upon a pillion, a pack-saddle, and one or two wallets, the\r\ntravelling furniture of Madge and her amiable mother.--\xe2\x80\x9cNow, saw ye e\xc3\xader\r\nin your life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, \xe2\x80\x9csae dainty a chamber of deas? see as the moon\r\nshines down sae caller on the fresh strae! There\xc3\xads no a pleasanter cell\r\nin Bedlam, for as braw a place as it is on the outside.--Were ye ever in\r\nBedlam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie faintly, appalled by the question, and the way in\r\nwhich it was put, yet willing to soothe her insane companion, being in\r\ncircumstances so unhappily precarious, that even the society of this\r\ngibbering madwoman seemed a species of protection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever in Bedlam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, as if with some surprise.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut ye\xc3\xadll hae\r\nbeen in the cells at Edinburgh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, I think thae daft carles the magistrates send naebody to Bedlam\r\nbut me--thae maun hae an unco respect for me, for whenever I am brought\r\nto them, thae aye hae me back to Bedlam. But troth, Jeanie\xe2\x80\x9d (she said\r\nthis in a very confidential tone), \xe2\x80\x9cto tell ye my private mind about it,\r\nI think ye are at nae great loss; for the keeper\xc3\xads a cross-patch, and he\r\nmaun hae it a\xc3\xad his ain gate, to be sure, or he makes the place waur than\r\nhell. I often tell him he\xc3\xads the daftest in a\xc3\xad the house.--But what are\r\nthey making sic a skirling for?--Deil ane o\xc3\xad them\xc3\xads get in here--it wadna\r\nbe mensfu\xc3\xad! I will sit wi\xc3\xad my back again the door; it winna be that easy\r\nstirring me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadge!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cMadge!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cMadge Wildfire!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cMadge devil! what have ye done\r\nwith the horse?\xe2\x80\x9d was repeatedly asked by the men without.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads e\xc3\xaden at his supper, puir thing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Madge; \xe2\x80\x9cdeil an ye were\r\nat yours, too, an it were scauding brimstone, and then we wad hae less o\xc3\xad\r\nyour din.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis supper!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the more sulky ruffian--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xc3\xadye mean by\r\nthat!--Tell me where he is, or I will knock your Bedlam brains out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads in Gaffer Gablewood\xc3\xads wheat-close, an ye maun ken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis wheat-close, you crazed jilt!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other, with an accent of\r\ngreat indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, dear Tyburn Tam, man, what ill will the blades of the young wheat do\r\nto the puir nag?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the question,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other robber; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what the country\r\nwill say to us to-morrow, when they see him in such quarters?--Go, Tom,\r\nand bring him in; and avoid the soft ground, my lad; leave no hoof-track\r\nbehind you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you give me always the fag of it, whatever is to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n grumbled his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeap, Laurence, you\xc3\xadre long enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other; and the fellow left\r\nthe barn accordingly, without farther remonstrance.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Madge had arranged herself for repose on the straw; but\r\nstill in a half-sitting posture, with her back resting against the door\r\nof the hovel, which, as it opened inwards, was in this manner kept shut\r\nby the weight of the person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xc3\xads mair shifts by stealing, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge Wildfire; \xe2\x80\x9cthough\r\nwhiles I can hardly get our mother to think sae. Wha wad hae thought but\r\nmysell of making a bolt of my ain back-bane? But it\xc3\xads no sae strong as\r\nthae that I hae seen in the Tolbooth at Edinburgh. The hammermen of\r\nEdinburgh are to my mind afore the warld for making stancheons,\r\nring-bolts, fetter-bolts, bars, and locks. And they arena that bad at\r\ngirdles for carcakes neither, though the Cu\xc3\xadross hammermen have the gree\r\nfor that. My mother had ance a bonny Cu\xc3\xadross girdle, and I thought to\r\nhave baked carcakes on it for my puir wean that\xc3\xads dead and gane nae fair\r\nway--But we maun a\xc3\xad dee, ye ken, Jeanie--You Cameronian bodies ken that\r\nbrawlies; and ye\xc3\xadre for making a hell upon earth that ye may be less\r\nunwillin\xc3\xad to part wi\xc3\xad it. But as touching Bedlam that ye were speaking\r\nabout, I\xc3\xadse ne\xc3\xader recommend it muckle the tae gate or the other, be it\r\nright--be it wrang. But ye ken what the sang says.\xe2\x80\x9d And, pursuing the\r\nunconnected and floating wanderings of her mind, she sung aloud--\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cIn the bonny cells of Bedlam,\r\n                        Ere I was ane-and-twenty,\r\n                    I had hempen bracelets strong,\r\n                       And merry whips, ding-dong,\r\n                    And prayer and fasting plenty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, Jeanie, I am something herse the night, and I canna sing muckle\r\nmair; and troth, I think, I am gaun to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drooped her head on her breast, a posture from which Jeanie, who\r\nwould have given the world for an opportunity of quiet to consider the\r\nmeans and the probability of her escape, was very careful not to disturb\r\nher. After nodding, however, for a minute\xc3\xador two, with her eyes\r\nhalf-closed, the unquiet and restless spirit of her malady again assailed\r\nMadge. She raised her head, and spoke, but with a lowered tone, which was\r\nagain gradually overcome by drowsiness, to which the fatigue of a day\xc3\xads\r\njourney on horseback had probably given unwonted occasion,--\xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken\r\nwhat makes me sae sleepy--I amaist never sleep till my bonny Lady Moon\r\ngangs till her bed--mair by token, when she\xc3\xads at the full, ye ken, rowing\r\naboon us yonder in her grand silver coach--I have danced to her my lane\r\nsometimes for very joy--and whiles dead folk came and danced wi\xc3\xad me--the\r\nlike o\xc3\xad Jock Porteous, or ony body I had ken\xc3\xadd when I was living--for ye\r\nmaun ken I was ance dead mysell.\xe2\x80\x9d Here the poor maniac sung, in a low and\r\nwild tone,\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cMy banes are buried in yon kirkyard\r\n                        Sae far ayont the sea,\r\n                  And it is but my blithesome ghaist\r\n                        That\xc3\xads speaking now to thee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after a\xc3\xad, Jeanie, my woman, naebody kens weel wha\xc3\xads living and wha\xc3\xads\r\ndead--or wha\xc3\xads gone to Fairyland--there\xc3\xads another question. Whiles I\r\nthink my puir bairn\xc3\xads dead--ye ken very weel it\xc3\xads buried--but that\r\nsignifies naething. I have had it on my knee a hundred times, and a\r\nhundred till that, since it was buried--and how could that be were it\r\ndead, ye ken?--it\xc3\xads merely impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d--And here, some conviction\r\nhalf-overcoming the reveries of her imagination, she burst into a fit of\r\ncrying and ejaculation, \xe2\x80\x9cWae\xc3\xads me! wae\xc3\xads me! wae\xc3\xads me!\xe2\x80\x9d till at length\r\nshe moaned and sobbed herself into a deep sleep, which was soon intimated\r\nby her breathing hard, leaving Jeanie to her own melancholy reflections\r\nand observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Bind her quickly; or, by this steel,\r\n               I\xc3\xadll tell, although I truss for company.\r\n                                       Fletcher.\r\n\r\nThe imperfect light which shone into the window enabled Jeanie to see\r\nthat there was scarcely any chance of making her escape in that\r\ndirection; for the aperture was high in the wall, and so narrow, that,\r\ncould she have climbed up to it, she might well doubt whether it would\r\nhave permitted her to pass her body through it. An unsuccessful attempt\r\nto escape would be sure to draw down worse treatment than she now\r\nreceived, and she, therefore, resolved to watch her opportunity carefully\r\nere making such a perilous effort. For this purpose she applied herself\r\nto the ruinous clay partition, which divided the hovel in which she now\r\nwas from the rest of the waste barn. It was decayed and full of cracks\r\nand chinks, one of which she enlarged with her fingers, cautiously and\r\nwithout noise, until she could obtain a plain view of the old hag and the\r\ntaller ruffian, whom they called Levitt, seated together beside the\r\ndecayed fire of charcoal, and apparently engaged in close conference. She\r\nwas at first terrified by the sight; for the features of the old woman\r\nhad a hideous cast of hardened and inveterate malice and ill-humour, and\r\nthose of the man, though naturally less unfavourable, were such as\r\ncorresponded well with licentious habits, and a lawless profession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I remembered,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cmy worthy fathers tales of a winter\r\nevening, how he was confined with the blessed martyr, Mr. James Renwick,\r\nwho lifted up the fallen standard of the true reformed Kirk of Scotland,\r\nafter the worthy and renowned Daniel Cameron, our last blessed\r\nbanner-man, had fallen among the swords of the wicked at Airsmoss, and\r\nhow the very hearts of the wicked malefactors and murderers, whom they\r\nwere confined withal, were melted like wax at the sound of their\r\ndoctrine: and I bethought mysell, that the same help that was wi\xc3\xad them in\r\ntheir strait, wad be wi\xc3\xad me in mine, an I could but watch the Lord\xc3\xads time\r\nand opportunity for delivering my feet from their snare; and I minded the\r\nScripture of the blessed Psalmist, whilk he insisteth on, as weel in the\r\nforty-second as in the forty-third psalm--\xc3\xabWhy art thou cast down, O my\r\nsoul, and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet\r\npraise Him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrengthened in a mind naturally calm, sedate, and firm, by the influence\r\nof religious confidence, this poor captive was enabled to attend to, and\r\ncomprehend, a great part of an interesting conversation which passed\r\nbetwixt those into whose hands she had fallen, notwithstanding that their\r\nmeaning was partly disguised by the occasional use of cant terms, of\r\nwhich Jeanie knew not the import, by the low tone in which they spoke,\r\nand by their mode of supplying their broken phrases by shrugs and signs,\r\nas is usual amongst those of their disorderly profession.\r\n\r\nThe man opened the conversation by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, dame, you see I am true\r\nto my friend. I have not forgot that you _planked a chury,_* which helped\r\nme through the bars of the Castle of York, and I came to do your work\r\nwithout asking questions; for one good turn deserves another.\r\n\r\n* Concealed a knife.\r\n\r\nBut now that Madge, who is as loud as Tom of Lincoln, is somewhat still,\r\nand this same Tyburn Neddie is shaking his heels after the old nag, why,\r\nyou must tell me what all this is about, and what\xc3\xads to be done--for d--n\r\nme if I touch the girl, or let her be touched, and she with Jim Rat\xc3\xads\r\npass, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art an honest lad, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cbut e\xc3\xaden too\r\ngood for thy trade; thy tender heart will get thee into trouble. I will\r\nsee ye gang up Holborn Hill backward, and a\xc3\xad on the word of some silly\r\nloon that could never hae rapped to ye had ye drawn your knife across his\r\nweasand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be balked there, old one,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the robber; \xe2\x80\x9cI have known\r\nmany a pretty lad cut short in his first summer upon the road, because he\r\nwas something hasty with his flats and sharps. Besides, a man would fain\r\nlive out his two years with a good conscience. So, tell me what all this\r\nis about, and what\xc3\xads to be done for you that one can do decently?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you must know, Frank--but first taste a snap of right Hollands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She drew a flask from her pocket, and filled the fellow a large bumper,\r\nwhich he pronounced to be the right thing.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know, then,\r\nFrank--wunna ye mend your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d again offering the flask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,--when a woman wants mischief from you, she always begins by\r\nfilling you drunk. D--n all Dutch courage. What I do I will do\r\nsoberly--I\xc3\xadll last the longer for that too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you must know,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the old woman, without any further\r\nattempts at propitiation, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this girl is going to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Jeanie could only distinguish the word sister.\r\n\r\nThe robber answered in a louder tone, \xe2\x80\x9cFair enough that; and what the\r\ndevil is your business with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness enough, I think. If the b--queers the noose, that silly cull\r\nwill marry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who cares if he does?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho cares, ye donnard Neddie! I care; and I will strangle her with my\r\nown hands, rather than she should come to Madge\xc3\xads preferment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadge\xc3\xads preferment! Does your old blind eyes see no farther than that?\r\nIf he is as you say, dye think he\xc3\xadll ever marry a moon-calf like Madge?\r\nEcod, that\xc3\xads a good one--Marry Madge Wildfire!--Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark ye, ye crack-rope padder, born beggar, and bred thief!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nhag, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose he never marries the wench, is that a reason he should\r\nmarry another, and that other to hold my daughter\xc3\xads place, and she\r\ncrazed, and I a beggar, and all along of him? But I know that of him will\r\nhang him--I know that of him will hang him, if he had a thousand lives--I\r\nknow that of him will hang--hang--hang him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe grinned as she repeated and dwelt upon the fatal monosyllable, with\r\nthe emphasis of a vindictive fiend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why don\xc3\xadt you hang--hang--hang him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank, repeating her\r\nwords contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cThere would be more sense in that, than in\r\nwreaking yourself here upon two wenches that have done you and your\r\ndaughter no ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ill?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old woman--\xe2\x80\x9cand he to marry this jail-bird, if\r\never she gets her foot loose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as there is no chance of his marrying a bird of your brood, I\r\ncannot, for my soul, see what you have to do with all this,\xe2\x80\x9d again\r\nreplied the robber, shrugging his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere there is aught to be\r\ngot, I\xc3\xadll go as far as my neighbours, but I hate mischief for mischiefs\r\nsake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would you go nae length for revenge?\xe2\x80\x9d said the hag--\xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nrevenge--the sweetest morsel to the mouth that over was cooked in hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil may keep it for his own eating, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the robber; \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nhang me if I like the sauce he dresses it with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRevenge!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the old woman; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, it is the best reward the devil\r\ngives us for our time here and hereafter. I have wrought hard for it--I\r\nhave suffered for it--and I have sinned for it--and I will have it,--or\r\nthere is neither justice in heaven or in hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLevitt had by this time lighted a pipe, and was listening with great\r\ncomposure to the frantic and vindictive ravings of the old hag. He was\r\ntoo much, hardened by his course of life to be shocked with them--too\r\nindifferent, and probably too stupid, to catch any part of their\r\nanimation or energy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cstill I say,\r\nthat if revenge is your wish, you should take it on the young fellow\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, drawing in her breath, with the eagerness of\r\na thirsty person while mimicking the action of drinking--\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\r\ncould--but no--I cannot--I cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not?--You would think little of peaching and hanging him for\r\nthis Scotch affair.--Rat me, one might have milled the Bank of England,\r\nand less noise about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nursed him at this withered breast,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old woman,\r\nfolding her hands on her bosom, as if pressing an infant to it, \xe2\x80\x9cand,\r\nthough he has proved an adder to me--though he has been the destruction\r\nof me and mine--though he has made me company for the devil, if there be\r\na devil, and food for hell, if there be such a place, yet I cannot take\r\nhis life.--No, I cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, with an appearance of rage\r\nagainst herself; \xe2\x80\x9cI have thought of it--I have tried it--but, Francis\r\nLevitt, I canna gang through wi\xc3\xadt--Na, na--he was the first bairn I ever\r\nnurst--ill I had been--and man can never ken what woman feels for the\r\nbairn she has held first to her bosom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Levitt, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have no experience; but, mother, they say\r\nyou ha\xc3\xadn\xc3\xadt been so kind to other bairns, as you call them, that have come\r\nin your way.--Nay, d--n me, never lay your hand on the whittle, for I am\r\ncaptain and leader here, and I will have no rebellion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hag, whose first motion had been, upon hearing the question, to grasp\r\nthe haft of a large knife, now unclosed her hand, stole it away from the\r\nweapon, and suffered it to fall by her side, while she proceeded with a\r\nsort of smile--\xe2\x80\x9cBairns! ye are joking, lad--wha wad touch bairns? Madge,\r\npuir thing, had a misfortune wi\xc3\xad ane--and the t\xc3\xadother\xe2\x80\x9d--Here her voice\r\nsunk so much, that Jeanie, though anxiously upon the watch, could not\r\ncatch a word she said, until she raised her tone at the conclusion of the\r\nsentence--\xe2\x80\x9cSo Madge, in her daffin\xc3\xad, threw it into the Nor\xc3\xad-lock, I\r\ntrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadge, whose slumbers, like those of most who labour under mental malady,\r\nhad been short, and were easily broken, now made herself heard from her\r\nplace of repose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, mother, that\xc3\xads a great lie, for I did nae sic thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, thou hellicat devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother--\xe2\x80\x9cBy Heaven! the other wench\r\nwill be waking too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank; and he rose, and followed Meg\r\nMurdockson across the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hag to her daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cor I sall drive the knife between\r\nthe planks into the Bedlam back of thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently she at the same time seconded her threat by pricking her with\r\nthe point of a knife, for Madge, with a faint scream, changed her place,\r\nand the door opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jennie in the Outlaws Hut--80]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old woman held a candle in one hand, and a knife in the other. Levitt\r\nappeared behind her, whether with a view of preventing, or assisting her\r\nin any violence she might meditate, could not be well guessed. Jeanie\xc3\xads\r\npresence of mind stood her friend in this dreadful crisis. She had\r\nresolution enough to maintain the attitude and manner of one who sleeps\r\nprofoundly, and to regulate even her breathing, notwithstanding the\r\nagitation of instant terror, so as to correspond with her attitude.\r\n\r\nThe old woman passed the light across her eyes; and although Jeanie\xc3\xads\r\nfears were so powerfully awakened by this movement, that she often\r\ndeclared afterwards, that she thought she saw the figures of her destined\r\nmurderers through her closed eyelids, she had still the resolution to\r\nmaintain the feint, on which her safety perhaps depended.\r\n\r\nLevitt looked at her with fixed attention; he then turned the old woman\r\nout of the place, and followed her himself. Having regained the outward\r\napartment, and seated themselves, Jeanie heard the highwayman say, to her\r\nno small relief, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xc3\xads as fast as if she were in Bedfordshire.--Now, old\r\nMeg, d--n me if I can understand a glim of this story of yours, or what\r\ngood it will do you to hang the one wench and torment the other; but, rat\r\nme, I will be true to my friend, and serve ye the way ye like it. I see\r\nit will be a bad job; but I do think I could get her down to Surfleet on\r\nthe Wash, and so on board Tom Moonshine\xc3\xads neat lugger, and keep her out\r\nof the way three or four weeks, if that will please ye--But d--n me if\r\nany one shall harm her, unless they have a mind to choke on a brace of\r\nblue plums.--It\xc3\xads a cruel, bad job, and I wish you and it, Meg, were both\r\nat the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, hinny Levitt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a ruffler, and\r\nwill have a\xc3\xad your ain gate--She shanna gang to heaven an hour sooner for\r\nme; I carena whether she live or die--it\xc3\xads her sister--ay, her sister!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xc3\xadll say no more about it; I hear Tom coming in. We\xc3\xadll couch a\r\nhogshead,* and so better had you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Lay ourselves down to sleep.\r\n\r\nThey retired to repose accordingly, and all was silent in this asylum of\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\nJeanie lay for a long time awake. At break of day she heard the two\r\nruffians leave the barn, after whispering to the old woman for some time.\r\nThe sense that she was now guarded by persons of her own sex gave her\r\nsome confidence, and irresistible lassitude at length threw her into\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nWhen the captive awakened, the sun was high in heaven, and the morning\r\nconsiderably advanced. Madge Wildfire was still in the hovel which had\r\nserved them for the night, and immediately bid her good-morning, with her\r\nusual air of insane glee. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd dye ken, lass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads queer\r\nthings chanced since ye hae been in the land of Nod. The constables hae\r\nbeen here, woman, and they met wi\xc3\xad my minnie at the door, and they\r\nwhirl\xc3\xadd her awa to the Justice\xc3\xads about the man\xc3\xads wheat.--Dear! thae\r\nEnglish churls think as muckle about a blade of wheat or grass, as a\r\nScotch laird does about his maukins and his muir-poots. Now, lass, if ye\r\nlike, we\xc3\xadll play them a fine jink; we will awa out and take a walk--they\r\nwill mak unco wark when they miss us, but we can easily be back by dinner\r\ntime, or before dark night at ony rate, and it will be some frolic and\r\nfresh air.--But maybe ye wad like to take some breakfast, and then lie\r\ndown again? I ken by mysell, there\xc3\xads whiles I can sit wi\xc3\xad my head in my\r\nhand the haill day, and havena a word to cast at a dog--and other whiles,\r\nthat I canna sit still a moment. That\xc3\xads when the folk think me warst, but\r\nI am aye canny eneugh--ye needna be feared to walk wi\xc3\xad me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad Madge Wildfire been the most raging lunatic, instead of possessing a\r\ndoubtful, uncertain, and twilight sort of rationality, varying, probably,\r\nfrom the influence of the most trivial causes, Jeanie would hardly have\r\nobjected to leave a place of captivity, where she had so much to\r\napprehend. She eagerly assured Madge that she had no occasion for further\r\nsleep, no desire whatever for eating; and, hoping internally that she was\r\nnot guilty of sin in doing so, she flattered her keeper\xc3\xads crazy humour\r\nfor walking in the woods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads no a\xc3\xadthegither for that neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Madge; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am\r\njudging ye will wun the better out o\xc3\xad thae folk\xc3\xads hands; no that they are\r\na\xc3\xadthegither bad folk neither, but they have queer ways wi\xc3\xad them, and I\r\nwhiles dinna think it has ever been weel wi\xc3\xad my mother and me since we\r\nkept sic-like company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the haste, the joy, the fear, and the hope of a liberated captive,\r\nJeanie snatched up her little bundle, followed Madge into the free air,\r\nand eagerly looked round her for a human habitation; but none was to be\r\nseen. The ground was partly cultivated, and partly left in its natural\r\nstate, according as the fancy of the slovenly agriculturists had decided.\r\nIn its natural state it was waste, in some places covered with dwarf\r\ntrees and bushes, in others swamp, and elsewhere firm and dry downs or\r\npasture grounds.\r\n\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads active mind next led her to conjecture which way the high-road\r\nlay, whence she had been forced. If she regained that public road, she\r\nimagined she must soon meet some person, or arrive at some house, where\r\nshe might tell her story, and request protection. But, after a glance\r\naround her, she saw with regret that she had no means whatever of\r\ndirecting her course with any degree of certainty, and that she was still\r\nin dependence upon her crazy companion. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we not walk upon the\r\nhigh-road?\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Madge, in such a tone as a nurse uses to coax a\r\nchild. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads brawer walking on the road than amang thae wild bushes and\r\nwhins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadge, who was walking very fast, stopped at this question, and looked at\r\nJeanie with a sudden and scrutinising glance, that seemed to indicate\r\ncomplete acquaintance with her purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cAha, lass!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9care\r\nye gaun to guide us that gate?--Ye\xc3\xadll be for making your heels save your\r\nhead, I am judging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie hesitated for a moment, on hearing her companion thus express\r\nherself, whether she had not better take the hint, and try to outstrip\r\nand get rid of her. But she knew not in which direction to fly; she was\r\nby no means sure that she would prove the swiftest, and perfectly\r\nconscious that in the event of her being pursued and overtaken, she would\r\nbe inferior to the madwoman in strength. She therefore gave up thoughts\r\nfor the present of attempting to escape in that manner, and, saying a few\r\nwords to allay Madge\xc3\xads suspicions, she followed in anxious apprehension\r\nthe wayward path by which her guide thought proper to lead her. Madge,\r\ninfirm of purpose, and easily reconciled to the present scene, whatever\r\nit was, began soon to talk with her usual diffuseness of ideas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads a dainty thing to be in the woods on a fine morning like this! I\r\nlike it far better than the town, for there isna a wheen duddie bairns to\r\nbe crying after ane, as if ane were a warld\xc3\xads wonder, just because\r\nane maybe is a thought bonnier and better put-on than their\r\nneighbours--though, Jeanie, ye suld never be proud o\xc3\xad braw claiths,\r\nor beauty neither--wae\xc3\xads me! they\xc3\xadre but a snare--I ance thought better\r\no\xc3\xadthem, and what came o\xc3\xadt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre ye sure ye ken the way ye are taking us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who began to\r\nimagine that she was getting deeper into the woods and more remote from\r\nthe high-road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I ken the road?--Wasna I mony a day living here, and what for\r\nshouldna I ken the road? I might hae forgotten, too, for it was afore my\r\naccident; but there are some things ane can never forget, let them try it\r\nas muckle as they like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time they had gained the deepest part of a patch of woodland. The\r\ntrees were a little separated from each other, and at the foot of one of\r\nthem, a beautiful poplar, was a hillock of moss, such as the poet of\r\nGrasmere has described. So soon as she arrived at this spot, Madge\r\nWildfire, joining her hands above her head with a loud scream that\r\nresembled laughter, flung herself all at once upon the spot, and remained\r\nlying there motionless.\r\n\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads first idea was to take the opportunity of flight; but her desire\r\nto escape yielded for a moment to apprehension for the poor insane being,\r\nwho, she thought, might perish for want of relief. With an effort, which\r\nin her circumstances, might be termed heroic, she stooped down, spoke in\r\na soothing tone, and endeavoured to raise up the forlorn creature. She\r\neffected this with difficulty, and as she placed her against the tree in\r\na sitting posture, she observed with surprise, that her complexion,\r\nusually florid, was now deadly pale, and that her face was bathed in\r\ntears. Notwithstanding her own extreme danger, Jeanie was affected by the\r\nsituation of her companion; and the rather, that, through the whole train\r\nof her wavering and inconsistent state of mind and line of conduct, she\r\ndiscerned a general colour of kindness towards herself, for which she\r\nfelt gratitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alane!--let me alane!\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor young woman, as her paroxysm\r\nof sorrow began to abate--\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alane--it does me good to weep. I canna\r\nshed tears but maybe ance or twice a year, and I aye come to wet this\r\nturf with them, that the flowers may grow fair, and the grass may be\r\ngreen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie--\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you weep so\r\nbitterly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xc3\xads matter enow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lunatic,--\xe2\x80\x9cmair than ae puir mind can\r\nbear, I trow. Stay a bit, and I\xc3\xadll tell you a\xc3\xad about it; for I like ye,\r\nJeanie Deans--a\xc3\xadbody spoke weel about ye when we lived in the Pleasaunts--\r\nAnd I mind aye the drink o\xc3\xad milk ye gae me yon day, when I had been on\r\nArthur\xc3\xads Seat for four-and-twenty hours, looking for the ship that\r\nsomebody was sailing in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words recalled to Jeanie\xc3\xads recollection, that, in fact, she had\r\nbeen one morning much frightened by meeting a crazy young woman near her\r\nfather\xc3\xads house at an early hour, and that, as she appeared to be\r\nharmless, her apprehension had been changed into pity, and she had\r\nrelieved the unhappy wanderer with some food, which she devoured with the\r\nhaste of a famished person. The incident, trifling in itself, was at\r\npresent of great importance, if it should be found to have made a\r\nfavourable and permanent impression in her favour on the mind of the\r\nobject of her charity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll tell ye a\xc3\xad about it, for ye are a decent man\xc3\xads\r\ndaughter--Douce Davie Deans, ye ken--and maybe ye\xc3\xadll can teach me to find\r\nout the narrow way, and the straight path, for I have been burning bricks\r\nin Egypt, and walking through the weary wilderness of Sinai, for lang and\r\nmony a day. But whenever I think about mine errors, I am like to cover my\r\nlips for shame.\xe2\x80\x9d--Here she looked up and smiled.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads a strange thing\r\nnow--I hae spoke mair gude words to you in ten minutes, than I wad speak\r\nto my mother in as mony years--it\xc3\xads no that I dinna think on them--and\r\nwhiles they are just at my tongue\xc3\xads end, but then comes the devil, and\r\nbrushes my lips with his black wing, and lays his broad black loof on my\r\nmouth--for a black loof it is, Jeanie--and sweeps away a\xc3\xad my gude\r\nthoughts, and dits up my gude words, and pits a wheen fule sangs and idle\r\nvanities in their place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry, Madge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie,--\xe2\x80\x9ctry to settle your mind and make your breast\r\nclean, and you\xc3\xadll find your heart easier.--Just resist the devil, and he\r\nwill flee from you--and mind that, as my worthy father tells me, there is\r\nnae devil sae deceitfu\xc3\xad as our ain wandering thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xc3\xads true too, lass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, starting up; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xc3\xadll gang a\r\ngate where the devil daurna follow me; and it\xc3\xads a gate that you will like\r\ndearly to gang--but I\xc3\xadll keep a fast haud o\xc3\xad your arm, for fear Apollyon\r\nshould stride across the path, as he did in the Pilgrim\xc3\xads Progress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly she got up, and, taking Jeanie by the arm, began to walk\r\nforward at a great pace; and soon, to her companion\xc3\xads no small joy, came\r\ninto a marked path, with the meanders of which she seemed perfectly\r\nacquainted. Jeanie endeavoured to bring her back to the confessional, but\r\nthe fancy was gone by. In fact, the mind of this deranged being resembled\r\nnothing so much as a quantity of dry leaves, which may for a few minutes\r\nremain still, but are instantly discomposed and put in motion by the\r\nfirst casual breath of air. She had now got John Bunyan\xc3\xads parable into\r\nher head, to the exclusion of everything else, and on she went with great\r\nvolubility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ye never read the Pilgrim\xc3\xads Progress? And you shall be the woman,\r\nChristiana, and I will be the maiden, Mercy--for ye ken Mercy was of the\r\nfairer countenance, and the more alluring than her companion--and if I\r\nhad my little messan dog here, it would be Great-heart, their guide, ye\r\nken, for he was e\xc3\xaden as bauld, that he wad bark at ony thing twenty times\r\nhis size; and that was e\xc3\xaden the death of him, for he bit Corporal\r\nMacAlpine\xc3\xads heels ae morning when they were hauling me to the\r\nguard-house, and Corporal MacAlpine killed the bit faithfu\xc3\xad thing wi\xc3\xad his\r\nLochaber axe--deil pike the Highland banes o\xc3\xad him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO fie! Madge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cye should not speak such words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads very true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, shaking her head; \xe2\x80\x9cbut then I maunna think\r\no\xc3\xad my puir bit doggie, Snap, when I saw it lying dying in the gutter. But\r\nit\xc3\xads just as weel, for it suffered baith cauld and hunger when it was\r\nliving, and in the grave there is rest for a\xc3\xad things--rest for the\r\ndoggie, and my puir bairn, and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour bairn?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, conceiving that by speaking on such a topic,\r\nsupposing it to be a real one, she could not fail to bring her companion\r\nto a more composed temper.\r\n\r\nShe was mistaken, however, for Madge coloured, and replied with some\r\nanger, \xe2\x80\x9c_My_ bairn? ay, to be sure, my bairn. Whatfor shouldna I hae a\r\nbairn and lose a bairn too, as weel as your bonnie tittie, the Lily of\r\nSt. Leonard\xc3\xads?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer struck Jeanie with some alarm, and she was anxious to soothe\r\nthe irritation she had unwittingly given occasion to. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry\r\nfor your misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry! what wad ye be sorry for?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Madge. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bairn was a\r\nblessing--that is, Jeanie, it wad hae been a blessing if it hadna been\r\nfor my mother; but my mother\xc3\xads a queer woman.--Ye see, there was an auld\r\ncarle wi\xc3\xad a bit land, and a gude clat o\xc3\xad siller besides, just the very\r\npicture of old Mr. Feeblemind or Mr. Ready-to-halt, that Great-heart\r\ndelivered from Slaygood the giant, when he was rifling him and about to\r\npick his bones, for Slaygood was of the nature of the flesh-eaters--and\r\nGreat-heart killed Giant Despair too--but I am doubting Giant Despair\xc3\xads\r\ncome alive again, for a\xc3\xad the story book--I find him busy at my heart\r\nwhiles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, and so the auld carle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, for she was painfully\r\ninterested in getting to the truth of Madge\xc3\xads history, which she could\r\nnot but suspect was in some extraordinary way linked and entwined with\r\nthe fate of her sister. She was also desirous, if possible, to engage her\r\ncompanion in some narrative which might be carried on in a lower tone of\r\nvoice, for she was in great apprehension lest the elevated notes of\r\nMadge\xc3\xads conversation should direct her mother or the robbers in search of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so the auld carle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge, repeating her words--\xe2\x80\x9cI wish ye had\r\nseen him stoiting about, aff ae leg on to the other, wi\xc3\xad a kind o\xc3\xad\r\ndot-and-go-one sort o\xc3\xad motion, as if ilk ane o\xc3\xad his twa legs had belanged\r\nto sindry folk--but Gentle George could take him aff brawly--Eh, as I\r\nused to laugh to see George gang hip-hop like him!--I dinna ken, I think\r\nI laughed heartier then than what I do now, though maybe no just sae\r\nmuckle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who was Gentle George?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, endeavouring to bring her back\r\nto her story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, he was Geordie Robertson, ye ken, when he was in Edinburgh; but\r\nthat\xc3\xads no his right name neither--His name is--But what is your business\r\nwi\xc3\xad his name?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as if upon sudden recollection, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have ye to\r\ndo asking for folk\xc3\xads names?--Have ye a mind I should scour my knife\r\nbetween your ribs, as my mother says?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs this was spoken with a menacing tone and gesture, Jeanie hastened to\r\nprotest her total innocence of purpose in the accidental question which\r\nshe had asked, and Madge Wildfire went on somewhat pacified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever ask folk\xc3\xads names, Jeanie--it\xc3\xads no civil--I hae seen half-a-dozen\r\no\xc3\xad folk in my mother\xc3\xads at ance, and ne\xc3\xader ane a\xc3\xad them ca\xc3\xadd the ither by\r\nhis name; and Daddie Ratton says, it is the most uncivil thing may be,\r\nbecause the bailie bodies are aye asking fashions questions, when ye saw\r\nsic a man, or sic a man; and if ye dinna ken their names, ye ken there\r\ncan be nae mair speerd about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what strange school,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Jeanie to herself, \xe2\x80\x9chas this poor\r\ncreature been bred up, where such remote precautions are taken against\r\nthe pursuits of justice? What would my father or Reuben Butler think if I\r\nwere to tell them there are sic folk in the world? And to abuse the\r\nsimplicity of this demented creature! Oh, that I were but safe at hame\r\namang mine ain leal and true people! and I\xc3\xadll bless God, while I have\r\nbreath, that placed me amongst those who live in His fear, and under the\r\nshadow of His wing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted by the insane laugh of Madge Wildfire, as she saw a\r\nmagpie hop across the path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there!--that was the gate my auld joe used to cross the country, but\r\nno just sae lightly--he hadna wings to help his auld legs, I trow; but I\r\nbehoved to have married him for a\xc3\xad that, Jeanie, or my mother wad hae\r\nbeen the dead o\xc3\xad me. But then came in the story of my poor bairn, and my\r\nmother thought he wad be deaved wi\xc3\xad it\xc3\xads skirling, and she pat it away in\r\nbelow the bit bourock of turf yonder, just to be out o\xc3\xad the gate; and I\r\nthink she buried my best wits with it, for I have never been just mysell\r\nsince. And only think, Jeanie, after my mother had been at a\xc3\xad these\r\npains, the auld doited body Johnny Drottle turned up his nose, and wadna\r\nhae aught to say to me! But it\xc3\xads little I care for him, for I have led a\r\nmerry life ever since, and ne\xc3\xader a braw gentleman looks at me but ye wad\r\nthink he was gaun to drop off his horse for mere love of me. I have ken\xc3\xadd\r\nsome o\xc3\xad them put their hand in their pocket, and gie me as muckle as\r\nsixpence at a time, just for my weel-faured face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech gave Jeanie a dark insight into Madge\xc3\xads history. She had been\r\ncourted by a wealthy suitor, whose addresses her mother had favoured,\r\nnotwithstanding the objection of old age and deformity. She had been\r\nseduced by some profligate, and, to conceal her shame and promote the\r\nadvantageous match she had planned, her mother had not hesitated to\r\ndestroy the offspring of their intrigue. That the consequence should be\r\nthe total derangement of amind which was constitutionally unsettled by\r\ngiddiness and vanity, was extremely natural; and such was, in fact, the\r\nhistory of Madge Wildfire\xc3\xads insanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n             So free from danger, free from fear\r\n             They crossed the court--right glad they were.\r\n                                            Christabel.\r\n\r\nPursuing the path which Madge had chosen, Jeanie Deans observed, to her\r\nno small delight, that marks of more cultivation appeared, and the\r\nthatched roofs of houses, with their blue smoke arising in little\r\ncolumns, were seen embosomed in a tuft of trees at some distance. The\r\ntrack led in that direction, and Jeanie, therefore, resolved, while Madge\r\ncontinued to pursue it, that she would ask her no questions; having had\r\nthe penetration to observe, that by doing so she ran the risk of\r\nirritating her guide, or awakening suspicions, to the impressions of\r\nwhich, persons in Madge\xc3\xads unsettled state of mind are particularly\r\nliable.\r\n\r\nMadge, therefore, uninterrupted, went on with the wild disjointed chat\r\nwhich her rambling imagination suggested; a mood in which she was much\r\nmore communicative respecting her own history, and that of others,\r\nthan when there was any attempt made, by direct queries, or\r\ncross-examinations, to extract information on these subjects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads a queer thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut whiles I can speak about the bit\r\nbairn and the rest of it, just as if it had been another body\xc3\xads, and no\r\nmy ain; and whiles I am like to break my heart about it--Had you ever a\r\nbairn, Jeanie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie replied in the negative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; but your sister had, though--and I ken what came o\xc3\xadt too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of heavenly mercy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, forgetting the line of\r\nconduct which she had hitherto adopted, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me but what became of that\r\nunfortunate babe, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadge stopped, looked at her gravely and fixedly, and then broke into a\r\ngreat fit of laughing--\xe2\x80\x9cAha, lass,--catch me if you can--I think it\xc3\xads\r\neasy to gar you trow ony thing.--How suld I ken onything o\xc3\xad your sister\xc3\xads\r\nwean? Lasses suld hae naething to do wi\xc3\xad weans till they are married--and\r\nthen a\xc3\xad the gossips and cummers come in and feast as if it were the\r\nblithest day in the warld.--They say maidens\xc3\xad bairns are weel guided. I\r\nwot that wasna true of your tittie\xc3\xads and mine; but these are sad tales to\r\ntell.--I maun just sing a bit to keep up my heart--It\xc3\xads a sang that\r\nGentle George made on me lang syne, when I went with him to Lockington\r\nwake, to see him act upon a stage, in fine clothes, with the player folk.\r\nHe might hae dune waur than married me that night as he promised--better\r\nwed over the mixen* as over the moor, as they say in Yorkshire--\r\n\r\n* A homely proverb, signifying better wed a neighbour than one fetched\r\nfrom a distance.--Mixen signifies dunghill.\r\n\r\nhe may gang farther and fare waur--but that\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad ane to the sang,\r\n\r\n\r\n           \xc3\xabI\xc3\xadm Madge of the country, I\xc3\xadm Madge of the town,\r\n            And I\xc3\xadm Madge of the lad I am blithest to own--\r\n               The Lady of Beeve in diamonds may shine,\r\n             But has not a heart half so lightsome as mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n             \xc3\xabI am Queen of the Wake, and I\xc3\xadm Lady of May,\r\n             And I lead the blithe ring round the May-pole to-day;\r\n            The wildfire that flashes so fair and so free,\r\n               Was never so bright, or so bonny, as me.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that the best o\xc3\xad a\xc3\xad my sangs,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the maniac, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he\r\nmade it. I am often singing it, and that\xc3\xads maybe the reason folk ca\xc3\xad me\r\nMadge Wildfire. I aye answer to the name, though it\xc3\xads no my ain, for\r\nwhat\xc3\xads the use of making a fash?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ye shouldna sing upon the Sabbath at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who, amid\r\nall her distress and anxiety, could not help being scandalised at the\r\ndeportment of her companion, especially as they now approached near to\r\nthe little village.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! is this Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother leads sic a life, wi\xc3\xad\r\nturning night into day, that ane loses a\xc3\xad count o\xc3\xad the days o\xc3\xad the week,\r\nand disna ken Sunday frae Saturday. Besides, it\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad your whiggery--in\r\nEngland, folk sings when they like--And then, ye ken, you are Christiana\r\nand I am Mercy--and ye ken, as they went on their way, they sang.\xe2\x80\x9d--And\r\nshe immediately raised one of John Bunyan\xc3\xads ditties:--\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9cHe that is down need fear no fall,\r\n                       He that is low no pride,\r\n                   He that is humble ever shall\r\n                       Have God to be his guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9cFulness to such a burthen is\r\n                       That go on pilgrimage;\r\n                   Here little, and hereafter bliss,\r\n                       Is best from age to age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do ye ken, Jeanie, I think there\xc3\xads much truth in that book, the\r\nPilgrim\xc3\xads Progress. The boy that sings that song was feeding his father\xc3\xads\r\nsheep in the Valley of Humiliation, and Mr. Great-heart says, that he\r\nlived a merrier life, and had more of the herb called heart\xc3\xads-ease in his\r\nbosom, than they that wear silk and velvet like me, and are as bonny as I\r\nam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie Deans had never read the fanciful and delightful parable to which\r\nMadge alluded. Bunyan was, indeed, a rigid Calvinist, but then he was\r\nalso a member of a Baptist congregation, so that his works had no place\r\non David Deans\xc3\xads shelf of divinity. Madge, however, at some time of her\r\nlife, had been well acquainted, as it appeared, with the most popular of\r\nhis performances, which, indeed, rarely fails to make a deep impression\r\nupon children, and people of the lower rank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI may weel say I am come out of the city of\r\nDestruction, for my mother is Mrs. Bat\xc3\xads-eyes, that dwells at Deadman\xc3\xads\r\ncorner; and Frank Levitt, and Tyburn Tam, they may be likened to Mistrust\r\nand Guilt, that came galloping up, and struck the poor pilgrim to the\r\nground with a great club, and stole a bag of silver, which was most of\r\nhis spending money, and so have they done to many, and will do to more.\r\nBut now we will gang to the Interpreter\xc3\xads house, for I ken a man that\r\nwill play the Interpreter right weel; for he has eyes lifted up to\r\nHeaven, the best of books in his hand, the law of truth written on his\r\nlips, and he stands as if he pleaded wi\xc3\xad men--Oh, if I had minded what he\r\nhad said to me, I had never been the cutaway creature that I am!--But it\r\nis all over now.--But we\xc3\xadll knock at the gate, and then the keeper will\r\nadmit Christiana, but Mercy will be left out--and then I\xc3\xadll stand at the\r\ndoor, trembling and crying, and then Christiana--that\xc3\xads you, Jeanie--will\r\nintercede for me; and then Mercy--that\xc3\xads me, ye ken, will faint; and then\r\nthe Interpreter--yes, the Interpreter, that\xc3\xads Mr. Staunton himself, will\r\ncome out and take me--that\xc3\xads poor, lost, demented me--by the hand, and\r\ngive me a pomegranate, and a piece of honeycomb, and a small bottle of\r\nspirits, to stay my fainting--and then the good times will come back\r\nagain, and we\xc3\xadll be the happiest folk you ever saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the confused assemblage of ideas indicated in this\r\nspeech, Jeanie thought she saw a serious purpose on the part of Madge, to\r\nendeavour to obtain the pardon and countenance of some one whom she had\r\noffended; an attempt the most likely of all others to bring them once\r\nmore into contact with law and legal protection. She, therefore, resolved\r\nto be guided by her while she was in so hopeful a disposition, and act\r\nfor her own safety according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThey were now close by the village, one of those beautiful scenes which\r\nare so often found in merry England, where the cottages, instead of being\r\nbuilt in two direct lines on each side of a dusty high-road, stand in\r\ndetached groups, interspersed not only with large oaks and elms, but with\r\nfruit-trees, so many of which were at this time in flourish, that the\r\ngrove seemed enamelled with their crimson and white blossoms. In the\r\ncentre of the hamlet stood the parish church, and its little Gothic\r\ntower, from which at present was heard the Sunday chime of bells.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will wait here until the folk are a\xc3\xad in the church--they ca\xc3\xad the kirk\r\na church in England, Jeanie, be sure you mind that--for if I was gaun\r\nforward amang them, a\xc3\xad the gaitts o\xc3\xad boys and lasses wad be crying at\r\nMadge Wildfire\xc3\xads tail, the little hell-rakers! and the beadle would be as\r\nhard upon us as if it was our fault. I like their skirting as ill as he\r\ndoes, I can tell him; I\xc3\xadm sure I often wish there was a het peat doun\r\ntheir throats when they set them up that gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConscious of the disorderly appearance of her own dress after the\r\nadventure of the preceding night, and of the grotesque habit and\r\ndemeanour of her guide, and sensible how important it was to secure an\r\nattentive and impatient audience to her strange story from some one who\r\nmight have the means to protect her, Jeanie readily acquiesced in Madge\xc3\xads\r\nproposal to rest under the trees, by which they were still somewhat\r\nscreened, until the commencement of service should give them an\r\nopportunity of entering the hamlet without attracting a crowd around\r\nthem. She made the less opposition, that Madge had intimated that this\r\nwas not the village where her mother was in custody, and that the two\r\nsquires of the pad were absent in a different direction.\r\n\r\nShe sate herself down, therefore, at the foot of an oak, and by the\r\nassistance of a placid fountain, which had been dammed up for the use of\r\nthe villagers, and which served her as a natural mirror, she began--no\r\nuncommon thing with a Scottish maiden of her rank--to arrange her\r\ntoilette in the open air, and bring her dress, soiled and disordered as\r\nit was, into such order as the place and circumstances admitted.\r\n\r\nShe soon perceived reason, however, to regret that she had set about this\r\ntask, however decent and necessary, in the present time and society.\r\nMadge Wildfire, who, among other indications of insanity, had a most\r\noverweening opinion of those charms, to which, in fact, she had owed her\r\nmisery, and whose mind, like a raft upon a lake, was agitated and driven\r\nabout at random by each fresh impulse, no sooner beheld Jeanie begin to\r\narrange her hair, place her bonnet in order, rub the dust from her shoes\r\nand clothes, adjust her neck-handkerchief and mittans, and so forth, than\r\nwith imitative zeal she began to bedizen and trick herself out with\r\nshreds and remnants of beggarly finery, which she took out of a little\r\nbundle, and which, when disposed around her person, made her appearance\r\nten times more fantastic and apish than it had been before.\r\n\r\nJeanie groaned in spirit, but dared not interfere in a matter so\r\ndelicate. Across the man\xc3\xads cap or riding hat which she wore, Madge placed\r\na broken and soiled white feather, intersected with one which had been\r\nshed from the train of a peacock. To her dress, which was a kind of\r\nriding-habit, she stitched, pinned, and otherwise secured, a large\r\nfurbelow of artificial flowers, all crushed, wrinkled and dirty, which\r\nhad at first bedecked a lady of quality, then descended to her Abigail,\r\nand dazzled the inmates of the servants\xc3\xad hall. A tawdry scarf of yellow\r\nsilk, trimmed with tinsel and spangles, which had seen as hard service,\r\nand boasted as honourable a transmission, was next flung over one\r\nshoulder, and fell across her person in the manner of a shoulder-belt, or\r\nbaldrick. Madge then stripped off the coarse ordinary shoes, which she\r\nwore, and replaced them by a pair of dirty satin ones, spangled and\r\nembroidered to match the scarf, and furnished with very high heels. She\r\nhad cut a willow switch in her morning\xc3\xads walk, almost as long as a boy\xc3\xads\r\nfishing-rod. This she set herself seriously to peel, and when it was\r\ntransformed into such a wand as the Treasurer or High Steward bears on\r\npublic occasions, she told Jeanie that she thought they now looked\r\ndecent, as young women should do upon the Sunday morning, and that, as\r\nthe bells had done ringing, she was willing to conduct her to the\r\nInterpreter\xc3\xads house.\r\n\r\nJeanie sighed heavily, to think it should be her lot on the Lord\xc3\xads day,\r\nand during kirk time too, to parade the street of an inhabited village\r\nwith so very grotesque a comrade; but necessity had no law, since,\r\nwithout a positive quarrel with the madwoman, which, in the\r\ncircumstances, would have been very unadvisable, she could see no means\r\nof shaking herself free of her society.\r\n\r\nAs for poor Madge, she was completely elated with personal vanity, and\r\nthe most perfect satisfaction concerning her own dazzling dress, and\r\nsuperior appearance. They entered the hamlet without being observed,\r\nexcept by one old woman, who, being nearly \xe2\x80\x9chigh-gravel blind,\xe2\x80\x9d was only\r\nconscious that something very fine and glittering was passing by, and\r\ndropped as deep a reverence to Madge as she would have done to a\r\ncountess. This filled up the measure of Madge\xc3\xads self-approbation. She\r\nminced, she ambled, she smiled, she simpered, and waved Jeanie Deans\r\nforward with the condescension of a noble _chaperone,_ who has undertaken\r\nthe charge of a country miss on her first journey to the capital.\r\n\r\nJeanie followed in patience, and with her eyes fixed on the ground, that\r\nshe might save herself the mortification of seeing her companion\xc3\xads\r\nabsurdities; but she started when, ascending two or three steps, she\r\nfound herself in the churchyard, and saw that Madge was making straight\r\nfor the door of the church. As Jeanie had no mind to enter the\r\ncongregation in such company, she walked aside from the pathway, and said\r\nin a decided tone, \xe2\x80\x9cMadge, I will wait here till the church comes\r\nout--you may go in by yourself if you have a mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke these words, she was about to seat herself upon one of the\r\ngrave-stones.\r\n\r\nMadge was a little before Jeanie when she turned aside; but, suddenly\r\nchanging her course, she followed her with long strides, and, with every\r\nfeature inflamed with passion, overtook and seized her by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cDo ye\r\nthink, ye ungratefu\xc3\xad wretch, that I am gaun to let you sit doun upon my\r\nfather\xc3\xads grave? The deil settle ye doun, if ye dinna rise and come into\r\nthe Interpreter\xc3\xads house, that\xc3\xads the house of God, wi\xc3\xad me, but I\xc3\xadll rive\r\nevery dud aft your back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe adapted the action to the phrase; for with one clutch she stripped\r\nJeanie of her straw bonnet and a handful of her hair to boot, and threw\r\nit up into an old yew-tree, where it stuck fast. Jeanie\xc3\xads first impulse\r\nwas to scream, but conceiving she might receive deadly harm before she\r\ncould obtain the assistance of anyone, notwithstanding the vicinity of\r\nthe church, she thought it wiser to follow the madwoman into the\r\ncongregation, where she might find some means of escape from her, or at\r\nleast be secured against her violence. But when she meekly intimated her\r\nconsent to follow Madge, her guide\xc3\xads uncertain brain had caught another\r\ntrain of ideas. She held Jeanie fast with one hand, and with the other\r\npointed to the inscription on the grave-stone, and commanded her to read\r\nit. Jeanie obeyed, and read these words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cThis Monument was erected to the Memory of Donald\r\n             Murdockson of the King\xc3\xads xxvi., or Cameronian\r\n          Regiment, a sincere Christian, a brave Soldier, and\r\n           a faithful Servant, by his grateful and sorrowing\r\n                       master, Robert Staunton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads very weel read, Jeanie; it\xc3\xads just the very words,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge,\r\nwhose ire had now faded into deep melancholy, and with a step which, to\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads great joy, was uncommonly quiet and mournful, she led her\r\ncompanion towards the door of the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Madge and Jennie--103]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of those old-fashioned Gothic parish churches which are\r\nfrequent in England, the most cleanly, decent, and reverential places of\r\nworship that are, perhaps, anywhere to be found in the Christian world.\r\nYet, notwithstanding the decent solemnity of its exterior, Jeanie was too\r\nfaithful to the directory of the Presbyterian kirk to have entered a\r\nprelatic place of worship, and would, upon any other occasion, have\r\nthought that she beheld in the porch the venerable figure of her father\r\nwaving her back from the entrance, and pronouncing in a solemn tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCease, my child, to hear the instruction which causeth to err from the\r\nwords of knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d But in her present agitating and alarming situation,\r\nshe looked for safety to this forbidden place of assembly, as the hunted\r\nanimal will sometimes seek shelter from imminent danger in the human\r\nhabitation, or in other places of refuge most alien to its nature and\r\nhabits. Not even the sound of the organ, and of one or two flutes which\r\naccompanied the psalmody, prevented her from following her guide into the\r\nchancel of the church.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Madge put her foot upon the pavement, and become sensible\r\nthat she was the object of attention to the spectators, than she resumed\r\nall the fantastic extravagance of deportment which some transient touch\r\nof melancholy had banished for an instant. She swam rather than walked up\r\nthe centre aisle, dragging Jeanie after her, whom she held fast by the\r\nhand. She would, indeed, have fain slipped aside into the pew nearest to\r\nthe door, and left Madge to ascend in her own manner and alone to the\r\nhigh places of the synagogue; but this was impossible, without a degree\r\nof violent resistance, which seemed to her inconsistent with the time and\r\nplace, and she was accordingly led in captivity up the whole length of\r\nthe church by her grotesque conductress, who, with half-shut eyes, a prim\r\nsmile upon her lips, and a mincing motion with her hands, which\r\ncorresponded with the delicate and affected pace at which she was pleased\r\nto move, seemed to take the general stare of the congregation, which such\r\nan exhibition necessarily excited, as a high compliment, and which she\r\nreturned by nods and half-courtesies to individuals amongst the audience,\r\nwhom she seemed to distinguish as acquaintances. Her absurdity was\r\nenhanced in the eyes of the spectators by the strange contrast which she\r\nformed to her companion, who, with dishevelled hair, downcast eyes, and a\r\nface glowing with shame, was dragged, as it were in triumph after her.\r\n\r\nMadge\xc3\xads airs were at length fortunately cut short by her encountering in\r\nher progress the looks of the clergyman, who fixed upon her a glance, at\r\nonce steady, compassionate, and admonitory. She hastily opened an empty\r\npew which happened to be near her, and entered, dragging in Jeanie after\r\nher. Kicking Jeanie on the shins, by way of hint that she should follow\r\nher example, she sunk her head upon her hand for the space of a minute.\r\nJeanie, to whom this posture of mental devotion was entirely new, did not\r\nattempt to do the like, but looked round her with a bewildered stare,\r\nwhich her neighbours, judging from the company in which they saw her,\r\nvery naturally ascribed to insanity. Every person in their immediate\r\nvicinity drew back from this extraordinary couple as far as the limits of\r\ntheir pew permitted; but one old man could not get beyond Madge\xc3\xads reach,\r\nere, she had snatched the prayer-book from his hand, and ascertained the\r\nlesson of the day. She then turned up the ritual, and with the most\r\noverstrained enthusiasm of gesture and manner, showed Jeanie the passages\r\nas they were read in the service, making, at the same time, her own\r\nresponses so loud as to be heard above those of every other person.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the shame and vexation which Jeanie felt in being thus\r\nexposed in a place of worship, she could not and durst not omit rallying\r\nher spirits so as to look around her, and consider to whom she ought to\r\nappeal for protection so soon as the service should be concluded. Her\r\nfirst ideas naturally fixed upon the clergyman, and she was confirmed in\r\nthe resolution by observing that he was an aged gentleman, of a dignified\r\nappearance and deportment, who read the service with an undisturbed and\r\ndecent gravity, which brought back to becoming attention those younger\r\nmembers of the congregation who had been disturbed by the extravagant\r\nbehaviour of Madge Wildfire. To the clergyman, therefore, Jeanie resolved\r\nto make her appeal when the service was over.\r\n\r\nIt is true she felt disposed to be shocked at his surplice, of which she\r\nhad heard so much, but which she had never seen upon the person of a\r\npreacher of the word. Then she was confused by the change of posture\r\nadopted in different parts of the ritual, the more so as Madge Wildfire,\r\nto whom they seemed familiar, took the opportunity to exercise authority\r\nover her, pulling her up and pushing her down with a bustling assiduity,\r\nwhich Jeanie felt must make them both the objects of painful attention.\r\nBut, notwithstanding these prejudices, it was her prudent resolution, in\r\nthis dilemma, to imitate as nearly as she could what was done around her.\r\nThe prophet, she thought, permitted Naaman the Syrian to bow even in the\r\nhouse of Rimmon. Surely if I, in this streight, worship the God of my\r\nfathers in mine own language, although the manner thereof be strange to\r\nme, the Lord will pardon me in this thing.\r\n\r\nIn this resolution she became so much confirmed, that, withdrawing\r\nherself from Madge as far as the pew permitted, she endeavoured to evince\r\nby serious and composed attention to what was passing, that her mind was\r\ncomposed to devotion. Her tormentor would not long have permitted her to\r\nremain quiet, but fatigue overpowered her, and she fell fast asleep in\r\nthe other corner of the pew.\r\n\r\nJeanie, though her mind in her own despite sometimes reverted to her\r\nsituation, compelled herself to give attention to a sensible, energetic,\r\nand well-composed discourse, upon the practical doctrines of\r\nChristianity, which she could not help approving, although it was every\r\nword written down and read by the preacher, and although it was delivered\r\nin a tone and gesture very different from those of Boanerges Stormheaven,\r\nwho was her father\xc3\xads favourite preacher. The serious and placid attention\r\nwith which Jeanie listened, did not escape the clergyman. Madge\r\nWildfire\xc3\xads entrance had rendered him apprehensive of some disturbance, to\r\nprovide against which, as far as possible, he often turned his eyes to\r\nthe part of the church where Jeanie and she were placed, and became soon\r\naware that, although the loss of her head-gear, and the awkwardness of\r\nher situation, had given an uncommon and anxious air to the features of\r\nthe former, yet she was in a state of mind very different from that of\r\nher companion. When he dismissed the congregation, he observed her look\r\naround with a wild and terrified look, as if uncertain what course she\r\nought to adopt, and noticed that she approached one or two of the most\r\ndecent of the congregation, as if to address them, and then shrunk back\r\ntimidly, on observing that they seemed to shun and to avoid her. The\r\nclergyman was satisfied there must be something extraordinary in all\r\nthis, and as a benevolent man, as well as a good Christian pastor, he\r\nresolved to inquire into the matter more minutely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n               There governed in that year\r\n               A stern, stout churl--an angry overseer.\r\n                                             Crabbe.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Staunton, for such was this worthy clergyman\xc3\xads name, was laying\r\naside his gown in the vestry, Jeanie was in the act of coming to an open\r\nrupture with Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must return to Mummer\xc3\xads barn directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madge; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xc3\xadll be ower\r\nlate, and my mother will be angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going back with you, Madge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, taking out a guinea,\r\nand offering it to her; \xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you, but I maun gang my ain\r\nroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me coming a\xc3\xad this way out o\xc3\xad my gate to pleasure you, ye ungratefu\xc3\xad\r\ncutty,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Madge; \xe2\x80\x9cand me to be brained by my mother when I gang\r\nhame, and a\xc3\xad for your sake!--But I will gar ye as good\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xc3\xads sake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie to a man who stood beside them, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep her\r\noff!--she is mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEy, ey,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the boor; \xe2\x80\x9cI hae some guess of that, and I trow thou\r\nbe\xc3\xadst a bird of the same feather.--Howsomever, Madge, I redd thee keep\r\nhand off her, or I\xc3\xadse lend thee a whisterpoop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral of the lower class of the parishioners now gathered round the\r\nstrangers, and the cry arose among the boys that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was a-going to be\r\na fite between mad Madge Murdockson and another Bess of Bedlam.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nwhile the fry assembled with the humane hope of seeing as much of the fun\r\nas possible, the laced cocked-hat of the beadle was discerned among the\r\nmultitude, and all made way for that person of awful authority. His first\r\naddress was to Madge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xc3\xads brought thee back again, thou silly donnot, to plague this\r\nparish? Hast thou brought ony more bastards wi\xc3\xad thee to lay to honest\r\nmen\xc3\xads doors? or does thou think to burden us with this goose, that\xc3\xads as\r\nhare-brained as thysell, as if rates were no up enow? Away wi\xc3\xad thee to\r\nthy thief of a mother; she\xc3\xads fast in the stocks at Barkston town-end--\r\nAway wi\xc3\xad ye out o\xc3\xad the parish, or I\xc3\xadse be at ye with the ratan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadge stood sulky for a minute; but she had been too often taught\r\nsubmission to the beadle\xc3\xads authority by ungentle means to feel courage\r\nenough to dispute it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my mother--my puir auld mother, is in the stocks at Barkston!--This\r\nis a\xc3\xad your wyte, Miss Jeanie Deans; but I\xc3\xadll be upsides wi\xc3\xad you, as sure\r\nas my name\xc3\xads Madge Wildfire--I mean Murdockson--God help me, I forget my\r\nvery name in this confused waste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she turned upon her heel, and went off, followed by all the\r\nmischievous imps of the village, some crying, \xe2\x80\x9cMadge, canst thou tell thy\r\nname yet?\xe2\x80\x9d some pulling the skirts of her dress, and all, to the best of\r\ntheir strength and ingenuity, exercising some new device or other to\r\nexasperate her into frenzy.\r\n\r\nJeanie saw her departure with infinite delight, though she wished that,\r\nin some way or other, she could have requited the service Madge had\r\nconferred upon her.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, she applied to the beadle to know whether \xe2\x80\x9cthere was any\r\nhouse in the village where she could be civilly entertained for her\r\nmoney, and whether she could be permitted to speak to the clergyman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, we\xc3\xadse ha\xc3\xad reverend care on thee; and I think,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the man\r\nof constituted authority, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, unless thou answer the Rector all the\r\nbetter, we\xc3\xadse spare thy money, and gie thee lodging at the parish charge,\r\nyoung woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I to go then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, in some alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I am to take thee to his Reverence, in the first place, to gie an\r\naccount o\xc3\xad thysell, and to see thou comena to be a burden upon the\r\nparish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to burden anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cI have enough for my\r\nown wants, and only wish to get on my journey safely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xc3\xads another matter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the beadle, \xe2\x80\x9cand if it be true--and\r\nI think thou dost not look so polrumptious as thy playfellow yonder--Thou\r\nwouldst be a mettle lass enow, an thou wert snog and snod a bid better.\r\nCome thou away, then--the Rector is a good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the minister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cwho preached\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe minister? Lord help thee! What kind o\xc3\xad Presbyterian art thou?--Why,\r\n\xc3\xabtis the Rector--the Rector\xc3\xads sell, woman, and there isna the like o\xc3\xad him\r\nin the county, nor the four next to it. Come away--away with thee--we\r\nmaunna bide here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I am very willing to go to see the minister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor though he read his discourse, and wore that surplice, as they call\r\nit here, I canna but think he must be a very worthy God-fearing man, to\r\npreach the root of the matter in the way he did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe disappointed rabble, finding that there was like to be no farther\r\nsport, had by this time dispersed, and Jeanie, with her usual patience,\r\nfollowed her consequential and surly, but not brutal, conductor towards\r\nthe rectory.\r\n\r\nThis clerical mansion was large and commodious, for the living was an\r\nexcellent one, and the advowson belonged to a very wealthy family in the\r\nneighbourhood, who had usually bred up a son or nephew to the church for\r\nthe sake of inducting him, as opportunity offered, into this very\r\ncomfortable provision. In this manner the rectory of Willingham had\r\nalways been considered as a direct and immediate appanage of Willingham\r\nHall; and as the rich baronets to whom the latter belonged had usually a\r\nson, or brother, or nephew, settled in the living, the utmost care had\r\nbeen taken to render their habitation not merely respectable and\r\ncommodious, but even dignified and imposing.\r\n\r\nIt was situated about four hundred yards from the village, and on a\r\nrising ground which sloped gently upward, covered with small enclosures,\r\nor closes, laid out irregularly, so that the old oaks and elms, which\r\nwere planted in hedge-rows, fell into perspective, and were blended\r\ntogether in beautiful irregularity. When they approached nearer to the\r\nhouse, a handsome gateway admitted them into a lawn, of narrow dimensions\r\nindeed, but which was interspersed with large sweet chestnut trees and\r\nbeeches, and kept in handsome order. The front of the house was\r\nirregular. Part of it seemed very old, and had, in fact, been the\r\nresidence of the incumbent in Romish times. Successive occupants had made\r\nconsiderable additions and improvements, each in the taste of his own\r\nage, and without much regard to symmetry. But these incongruities of\r\narchitecture were so graduated and happily mingled, that the eye, far\r\nfrom being displeased with the combinations of various styles, saw\r\nnothing but what was interesting in the varied and intricate pile which\r\nthey displayed. Fruit-trees displayed on the southern wall, outer\r\nstaircases, various places of entrance, a combination of roofs and\r\nchimneys of different ages, united to render the front, not indeed\r\nbeautiful or grand, but intricate, perplexed, or, to use Mr. Price\xc3\xads\r\nappropriate phrase, picturesque. The most considerable addition was that\r\nof the present Rector, who, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing a bookish man,\xe2\x80\x9d as the beadle was at\r\nthe pains to inform Jeanie, to augment, perhaps, her reverence for the\r\nperson before whom she was to appear, had built a handsome library and\r\nparlour, and no less than two additional bedrooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMony men would hae scrupled such expense,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the parochial\r\nofficer, \xe2\x80\x9cseeing as the living mun go as it pleases Sir Edmund to will\r\nit; but his Reverence has a canny bit land of his own, and need not look\r\non two sides of a penny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie could not help comparing the irregular yet extensive and\r\ncommodious pile of building before her to the \xe2\x80\x9cManses\xe2\x80\x9d in her own\r\ncountry, where a set of penurious heritors, professing all the while the\r\ndevotion of their lives and fortunes to the Presbyterian establishment,\r\nstrain their inventions to discover what may be nipped, and clipped, and\r\npared from a building which forms but a poor accommodation even for the\r\npresent incumbent, and, despite the superior advantage of stone-masonry,\r\nmust, in the course of forty or fifty years, again burden their\r\ndescendants with an expense, which, once liberally and handsomely\r\nemployed, ought to have freed their estates from a recurrence of it for\r\nmore than a century at least.\r\n\r\nBehind the Rector\xc3\xads house the ground sloped down to a small river, which,\r\nwithout possessing the romantic vivacity and rapidity of a northern\r\nstream, was, nevertheless, by its occasional appearance through the\r\nranges of willows and poplars that crowned its banks, a very pleasing\r\naccompaniment to the landscape. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the best trouting stream,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe beadle, whom the patience of Jeanie, and especially the assurance\r\nthat she was not about to become a burden to the parish, had rendered\r\nrather communicative, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best trouting stream in all Lincolnshire; for\r\nwhen you got lower, there was nought to be done wi\xc3\xad fly-fishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning aside from the principal entrance, he conducted Jeanie towards a\r\nsort of portal connected with the older part of the building, which was\r\nchiefly occupied by servants, and knocking at the door, it was opened by\r\na servant in grave purple livery, such as befitted a wealthy and\r\ndignified clergyman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dost do, Tummas?\xe2\x80\x9d said the beadle--\xe2\x80\x9cand how\xc3\xads young Measter\r\nStaunton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, but poorly--but poorly, Measter Stubbs.--Are you wanting to see his\r\nReverence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Tummas; please to say I ha\xc3\xad brought up the young woman as came\r\nto service to-day with mad Madge Murdockson seems to be a decentish koind\r\no\xc3\xad body; but I ha\xc3\xad asked her never a question. Only I can tell his\r\nReverence that she is a Scotchwoman, I judge, and as flat as the fens of\r\nHolland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTummas honoured Jeanie Deans with such a stare, as the pampered domestics\r\nof the rich, whether spiritual or temporal, usually esteem it part of\r\ntheir privilege to bestow upon the poor, and then desired Mr. Stubbs and\r\nhis charge to step in till he informed his master of their presence.\r\n\r\nThe room into which he showed them was a sort of steward\xc3\xads parlour, hung\r\nwith a county map or two, and three or four prints of eminent persons\r\nconnected with the county, as Sir William Monson, James York the\r\nblacksmith of Lincoln,* and the famous Peregrine, Lord Willoughby, in\r\ncomplete armour, looking as when he said in the words of the legend below\r\nthe engraving,--\r\n\r\n* [Author of the _Union of Honour,_ a treatise on English Heraldry.\r\nLondon, 1641.]\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9cStand to it, noble pikemen,\r\n                        And face ye well about;\r\n                   And shoot ye sharp, bold bowmen,\r\n                       And we will keep them out.\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cYe musquet and calliver-men,\r\n                       Do you prove true to me,\r\n                  I\xc3\xadll be the foremost man in fight,\r\n                       Said brave Lord Willoughbee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A \xe2\x80\x9cSummat\xe2\x80\x9d to Eat and Drink--113]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they had entered this apartment, Tummas as a matter of course\r\noffered, and as a matter of course Mr. Stubbs accepted, a \xe2\x80\x9csummat\xe2\x80\x9d to eat\r\nand drink, being the respectable relies of a gammon of bacon, and a\r\n_whole whiskin,_ or black pot of sufficient double ale. To these eatables\r\nMr. Beadle seriously inclined himself, and (for we must do him justice)\r\nnot without an invitation to Jeanie, in which Tummas joined, that his\r\nprisoner or charge would follow his good example. But although she might\r\nhave stood in need of refreshment, considering she had tasted no food\r\nthat day, the anxiety of the moment, her own sparing and abstemious\r\nhabits, and a bashful aversion to eat in company of the two strangers,\r\ninduced her to decline their courtesy. So she sate in a chair apart,\r\nwhile Mr. Stubbs and Mr. Tummas, who had chosen to join his friend in\r\nconsideration that dinner was to be put back till after the afternoon\r\nservice, made a hearty luncheon, which lasted for half-an-hour, and might\r\nnot then have concluded, had not his Reverence rung his bell, so that\r\nTummas was obliged to attend his master. Then, and no sooner, to save\r\nhimself the labour of a second journey to the other end of the house, he\r\nannounced to his master the arrival of Mr. Stubbs, with the other\r\nmadwoman, as he chose to designate Jeanie, as an event which had just\r\ntaken place. He returned with an order that Mr. Stubbs and the young\r\nwoman should be instantly ushered up to the library. The beadle bolted in\r\nhaste his last mouthful of fat bacon, washed down the greasy morsel with\r\nthe last rinsings of the pot of ale, and immediately marshalled Jeanie\r\nthrough one or two intricate passages which led from the ancient to the\r\nmore modern buildings, into a handsome little hall, or anteroom,\r\nadjoining to the library, and out of which a glass door opened to the\r\nlawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stubbs, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I tell his Reverence you are come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he opened a door and entered the library. Without wishing to\r\nhear their conversation, Jeanie, as she was circumstanced, could not\r\navoid it; for as Stubbs stood by the door, and his Reverence was at the\r\nupper end of a large room, their conversation was necessarily audible in\r\nthe anteroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have brought the young woman here at last, Mr. Stubbs. I expected\r\nyou some time since. You know I do not wish such persons to remain in\r\ncustody a moment without some inquiry into their situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, your Reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the beadle; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the young woman had\r\neat nought to-day, and so Measter Tummas did set down a drap of drink and\r\na morsel, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThomas was very right, Mr. Stubbs; and what has, become of the other\r\nmost unfortunate being?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Stubbs, \xe2\x80\x9cI did think the sight on her would but vex\r\nyour Reverence, and soa I did let her go her ways back to her mother, who\r\nis in trouble in the next parish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn trouble!--that signifies in prison, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Staunton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, truly; something like it, an it like your Reverence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretched, unhappy, incorrigible woman!\xe2\x80\x9d said the clergyman. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\r\nsort of person is this companion of hers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, decent enow, an it like your Reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stubbs; \xe2\x80\x9cfor aught I\r\nsees of her, there\xc3\xads no harm of her, and she says she has cash enow to\r\ncarry her out of the county.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCash! that is always what you think of, Stubbs--But, has she sense?--has\r\nshe her wits?--has she the capacity of taking care of herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, your Reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Stubbs, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot just say--I will be\r\nsworn she was not born at Witt-ham;* for Gaffer Gibbs looked at her all\r\nthe time of service, and he says, she could not turn up a single lesson\r\nlike a Christian, even though she had Madge Murdockson to help her--but\r\nthen, as to fending for herself, why, she\xc3\xads a bit of a Scotchwoman, your\r\nReverence, and they say the worst donnot of them can look out for their\r\nown turn--and she is decently put on enow, and not bechounched like\r\nt\xc3\xadother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* A proverbial and punning expression in that county, to intimate that a\r\nperson is not very clever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend her in here, then, and do you remain below, Mr. Stubbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis colloquy had engaged Jeanie\xc3\xads attention so deeply, that it was not\r\nuntil it was over that she observed that the sashed door, which, we have\r\nsaid, led from the anteroom into the garden, was opened, and that there\r\nentered, or rather was borne in by two assistants, a young man, of a very\r\npale and sickly appearance, whom they lifted to the nearest couch, and\r\nplaced there, as if to recover from the fatigue of an unusual exertion.\r\nJust as they were making this arrangement, Stubbs came out of the\r\nlibrary, and summoned Jeanie to enter it. She obeyed him, not without\r\ntremor; for, besides the novelty of the situation, to a girl of her\r\nsecluded habits, she felt also as if the successful prosecution of her\r\njourney was to depend upon the impression she should be able to make on\r\nMr. Staunton.\r\n\r\nIt is true, it was difficult to suppose on what pretext a person\r\ntravelling on her own business, and at her own charge, could be\r\ninterrupted upon her route. But the violent detention she had already\r\nundergone, was sufficient to show that there existed persons at no great\r\ndistance who had the interest, the inclination, and the audacity,\r\nforcibly to stop her journey, and she felt the necessity of having some\r\ncountenance and protection, at least till she should get beyond their\r\nreach. While these things passed through her mind, much faster than our\r\npen and ink can record, or even the reader\xc3\xads eye collect the meaning of\r\nits traces, Jeanie found herself in a handsome library, and in presence\r\nof the Rector of Willingham. The well-furnished presses and shelves which\r\nsurrounded the large and handsome apartment, contained more books than\r\nJeanie imagined existed in the world, being accustomed to consider as an\r\nextensive collection two fir shelves, each about three feet long, which\r\ncontained her father\xc3\xads treasured volumes, the whole pith and marrow, as\r\nhe used sometimes to boast, of modern divinity. An orrery, globes, a\r\ntelescope, and some other scientific implements, conveyed to Jeanie an\r\nimpression of admiration and wonder, not unmixed with fear; for, in her\r\nignorant apprehension, they seemed rather adapted for magical purposes\r\nthan any other; and a few stuffed animals (as the Rector was fond of\r\nnatural history) added to the impressive character of the apartment.\r\n\r\nMr. Staunton spoke to her with great mildness. He observed, that,\r\nalthough her appearance at church had been uncommon, and in strange, and\r\nhe must add, discreditable society, and calculated, upon the whole, to\r\ndisturb the congregation during divine worship, he wished, nevertheless,\r\nto hear her own account of herself before taking any steps which his duty\r\nmight seem to demand. He was a justice of peace, he informed her, as well\r\nas a clergyman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Honour\xe2\x80\x9d (for she would not say his Reverence) \xe2\x80\x9cwas very civil and\r\nkind,\xe2\x80\x9d was all that poor Jeanie could at first bring out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d said the clergyman, more peremptorily--\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwhat do you do in this country, and in such company?--We allow no\r\nstrollers or vagrants here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a vagrant or a stroller, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, a little roused by\r\nthe supposition. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a decent Scots lass, travelling through the land\r\non my own business and my own expenses and I was so unhappy as to fall in\r\nwith bad company, and was stopped a\xc3\xad night on my journey. And this puir\r\ncreature, who is something light-headed, let me out in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad company!\xe2\x80\x9d said the clergyman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, young woman, you have\r\nnot been sufficiently anxious to avoid them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been brought up to shun evil\r\ncommunication. But these wicked people were thieves, and stopped me by\r\nviolence and mastery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThieves!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Staunton; \xe2\x80\x9cthen you charge them with robbery, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; they did not take so much as a boddle from me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nJeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cnor did they use me ill, otherwise than by confining me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clergyman inquired into the particulars of her adventure, which she\r\ntold him from point to point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an extraordinary, and not a very probable tale, young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n resumed Mr. Staunton. \xe2\x80\x9cHere has been, according to your account, a great\r\nviolence committed without any adequate motive. Are you aware of the law\r\nof this country--that if you lodge this charge, you will be bound over to\r\nprosecute this gang?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie did not understand him, and he explained, that the English law, in\r\naddition to the inconvenience sustained by persons who have been robbed\r\nor injured, has the goodness to intrust to them the care and the expense\r\nof appearing as prosecutors.\r\n\r\nJeanie said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat her business at London was express; all she wanted\r\nwas, that any gentleman would, out of Christian charity, protect her to\r\nsome town where she could hire horses and a guide; and finally,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be her father\xc3\xads mind that she was not free to give\r\ntestimony in an English court of justice, as the land was not under a\r\ndirect gospel dispensation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Staunton stared a little, and asked if her father was a Quaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie--\xe2\x80\x9cHe is nae schismatic nor sectary, nor\r\never treated for sic black commodities as theirs, and that\xc3\xads weel kend o\xc3\xad\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is his name, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Staunton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavid Deans, sir, the cowfeeder at Saint Leonard\xc3\xads Crags, near\r\nEdinburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA deep groan from the anteroom prevented the Rector from replying, and,\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cGood God! that unhappy boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he left Jeanie alone, and\r\nhastened into the outer apartment.\r\n\r\nSome noise and bustle was heard, but no one entered the library for the\r\nbest part of an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Fantastic passions\xc3\xad maddening brawl!\r\n                     And shame and terror over all!\r\n                 Deeds to be hid which were not hid,\r\n                 Which, all confused, I could not know\r\n                     Whether I suffer\xc3\xadd or I did,\r\n                 For all seem\xc3\xadd guilt, remorse, or woe;\r\n                     My own, or others, still the same\r\n                 Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame.\r\n                                         Coleridge.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval while she was thus left alone, Jeanie anxiously\r\nrevolved in her mind what course was best for her to pursue. She was\r\nimpatient to continue her journey, yet she feared she could not safely\r\nadventure to do so while the old hag and her assistants were in the\r\nneighbourhood, without risking a repetition of their violence. She\r\nthought she could collect from the conversation which she had partly\r\noverheard, and also from the wild confessions of Madge Wildfire, that her\r\nmother had a deep and revengeful motive for obstructing her journey if\r\npossible. And from whom could she hope for assistance if not from Mr.\r\nStaunton? His whole appearance and demeanour seemed to encourage her\r\nhopes. His features were handsome, though marked with a deep cast of\r\nmelancholy; his tone and language were gentle and encouraging; and, as he\r\nhad served in the army for several years during his youth, his air\r\nretained that easy frankness which is peculiar to the profession of arms.\r\nHe was, besides, a minister of the gospel; and, although a worshipper,\r\naccording to Jeanie\xc3\xads notions, in the court of the Gentiles, and so\r\nbenighted as to wear a surplice; although he read the Common Prayer, and\r\nwrote down every word of his sermon before delivering it; and although he\r\nwas, moreover, in strength of lungs, as well as pith and marrow of\r\ndoctrine, vastly inferior to Boanerges Stormheaven, Jeanie still thought\r\nhe must be a very different person from Curate Kilstoup, and other\r\nprelatical divines of her father\xc3\xads earlier days, who used to get drunk in\r\ntheir canonical dress, and hound out the dragoons against the wandering\r\nCameronians. The house seemed to be in some disturbance, but as she could\r\nnot suppose she was altogether forgotten, she thought it better to remain\r\nquiet in the apartment where she had been left, till some one should take\r\nnotice of her.\r\n\r\nThe first who entered was, to her no small delight, one of her own sex, a\r\nmotherly-looking aged person of a housekeeper. To her Jeanie explained\r\nher situation in a few words, and begged her assistance.\r\n\r\nThe dignity of a housekeeper did not encourage too much familiarity with\r\na person who was at the Rectory on justice-business, and whose character\r\nmight seem in her eyes somewhat precarious; but she was civil, although\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer young master,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chad had a bad accident by a fall from his\r\nhorse, which made him liable to fainting fits; he had been taken very ill\r\njust now, and it was impossible his Reverence could see Jeanie for some\r\ntime; but that she need not fear his doing all that was just and proper\r\nin her behalf the instant he could get her business attended to.\xe2\x80\x9d--She\r\nconcluded by offering to show Jeanie a room, where she might remain till\r\nhis Reverence was at leisure.\r\n\r\nOur heroine took the opportunity to request the means of adjusting and\r\nchanging her dress.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper, in whose estimation order and cleanliness ranked high\r\namong personal virtues, gladly complied with a request so reasonable; and\r\nthe change of dress which Jeanie\xc3\xads bundle furnished made so important an\r\nimprovement in her appearance, that the old lady hardly knew the soiled\r\nand disordered traveller, whose attire showed the violence she had\r\nsustained, in the neat, clean, quiet-looking little Scotch-woman, who now\r\nstood before her. Encouraged by such a favourable alteration in her\r\nappearance, Mrs. Dalton ventured to invite Jeanie to partake of her\r\ndinner, and was equally pleased with the decent propriety of her conduct\r\nduring the meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou canst read this book, canst thou, young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady,\r\nwhen their meal was concluded, laying her hand upon a large Bible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope sae, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, surprised at the question \xe2\x80\x9cmy father\r\nwad hae wanted mony a thing ere I had wanted _that_ schuling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better sign of him, young woman. There are men here, well to pass in\r\nthe world, would not want their share of a Leicester plover, and that\xc3\xads a\r\nbag-pudding, if fasting for three hours would make all their poor\r\nchildren read the Bible from end to end. Take thou the book, then, for my\r\neyes are something dazed, and read where thou listest--it\xc3\xads the only book\r\nthou canst not happen wrong in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie was at first tempted to turn up the parable of the good Samaritan,\r\nbut her conscience checked her, as if it were a use of Scripture, not for\r\nher own edification, but to work upon the mind of others for the relief\r\nof her worldly afflictions; and under this scrupulous sense of duty, she\r\nselected, in preference, a\r\nCHAPTER of the prophet Isaiah, and read it,\r\nnotwithstanding her northern\xc3\xad accent and tone, with a devout propriety,\r\nwhich greatly edified Mrs. Dalton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9can all Scotchwomen were sic as thou but it was our luck\r\nto get born devils of thy country, I think--every one worse than t\xc3\xadother.\r\nIf thou knowest of any tidy lass like thysell that wanted a place, and\r\ncould bring a good character, and would not go laiking about to wakes and\r\nfairs, and wore shoes and stockings all the day round--why, I\xc3\xadll not say\r\nbut we might find room for her at the Rectory. Hast no cousin or sister,\r\nlass, that such an offer would suit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was touching upon a sore point, but Jeanie was spared the pain of\r\nreplying by the entrance of the same man-servant she had seen before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeaster wishes to see the young woman from Scotland,\xe2\x80\x9d was Tummas\xc3\xads\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to his Reverence, my dear, as fast as you can, and tell him all your\r\nstory--his Reverence is a kind man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dalton. \xe2\x80\x9cI will fold down\r\nthe leaf, and wake you a cup of tea, with some nice muffin, against you\r\ncome down, and that\xc3\xads what you seldom see in Scotland, girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeaster\xc3\xads waiting for the young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tummas impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Jack-Sauce, and what is your business to put in your oar?--And\r\nhow often must I tell you to call Mr. Staunton his Reverence, seeing as\r\nhe is a dignified clergyman, and not be meastering, meastering him, as if\r\nhe were a little petty squire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Jeanie was now at the door, and ready to accompany Tummas, the footman\r\nsaid nothing till he got into the passage, when he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\nmoe masters than one in this house, and I think we shall have a mistress\r\ntoo, an Dame Dalton carries it thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTummas led the way through a more intricate range of passages than Jeanie\r\nhad yet threaded, and ushered her into an apartment which was darkened by\r\nthe closing of most of the window-shutters, and in which was a bed with\r\nthe curtains partly drawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the young woman, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tummas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice from the bed, but not that of his Reverence;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbe ready to answer the bell, and leave the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, confounded at finding herself in\r\nthe apartment of an invalid; \xe2\x80\x9cthe servant told me that the minister--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xc3\xadt trouble yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no mistake. I know\r\nmore of your affairs than my father, and I can manage them better.--Leave\r\nthe room, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d The servant obeyed.--\xe2\x80\x9cWe must not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the invalid,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9close time, when we have little to lose. Open the shutters of that\r\nwindow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did so, and as he drew aside the curtain of his bed, the light fell\r\non his pale countenance, as, turban\xc3\xadd with bandages, and dressed in a\r\nnight-gown, he lay, seemingly exhausted, upon the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cJeanie Deans; can you not recollect me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, full of surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI was never in this country\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I may have been in yours. Think--recollect. I should faint did I\r\nname the name you are most dearly bound to loathe and to detest.\r\nThink--remember!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA terrible recollection flashed on Jeanie, which every tone of the\r\nspeaker confirmed, and which his next words rendered certainty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe composed--remember Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn, and the moonlight night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie sunk down on a chair with clasped hands, and gasped in agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here I lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clike a crushed snake, writhing with\r\nimpatience at my incapacity of motion--here I lie, when I ought to have\r\nbeen in Edinburgh, trying every means to save a life that is dearer to me\r\nthan my own.--How is your sister?--how fares it with her?--condemned to\r\ndeath, I know it, by this time! O, the horse that carried me safely on a\r\nthousand errands of folly and wickedness, that he should have broke down\r\nwith me on the only good mission I have undertaken for years! But I must\r\nrein in my passion--my frame cannot endure it, and I have much to say.\r\nGive me some of the cordial which stands on that table.--Why do you\r\ntremble? But you have too good cause.--Let it stand--I need it not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie, however reluctant, approached him with the cup into which she had\r\npoured the draught, and could not forbear saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a cordial for\r\nthe mind, sir, if the wicked will turn from their transgressions, and\r\nseek to the Physician of souls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d he said sternly--\xe2\x80\x9cand yet I thank you. But tell me, and lose\r\nno time in doing so, what you are doing in this country? Remember, though\r\nI have been your sister\xc3\xads worst enemy, yet I will serve her with the best\r\nof my blood, and I will serve you for her sake; and no one can serve you\r\nto such purpose, for no one can know the circumstances so well--so speak\r\nwithout fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, collecting her spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cI trust in\r\nGod; and if it pleases Him to redeem my sister\xc3\xads captivity, it is all I\r\nseek, whosoever be the instrument. But, sir, to be plain with you, I dare\r\nnot use your counsel, unless I were enabled to see that it accords with\r\nthe law which I must rely upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take the Puritan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried George Staunton, for so we must now\r\ncall him--\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon; but I am naturally impatient, and you drive\r\nme mad! What harm can it possibly do to tell me in what situation your\r\nsister stands, and your own expectations of being able to assist her? It\r\nis time enough to refuse my advice when I offer any which you may think\r\nimproper. I speak calmly to you, though \xc3\xabtis against my nature; but don\xc3\xadt\r\nurge me to impatience--it will only render me incapable of serving\r\nEffie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was in the looks and words of this unhappy young man a sort of\r\nrestrained eagerness and impetuosity which seemed to prey upon itself, as\r\nthe impatience of a fiery steed fatigues itself with churning upon the\r\nbit. After a moment\xc3\xads consideration, it occurred to Jeanie that she was\r\nnot entitled to withhold from him, whether on her sister\xc3\xads account or her\r\nown, the fatal account of the consequences of the crime which he had\r\ncommitted, nor to reject such advice, being in itself lawful and\r\ninnocent, as he might be able to suggest in the way of remedy.\r\nAccordingly, in as few words as she could express it, she told the\r\nhistory of her sister\xc3\xads trial and condemnation, and of her own journey as\r\nfar as Newark. He appeared to listen in the utmost agony of mind, yet\r\nrepressed every violent symptom of emotion, whether by gesture or sound,\r\nwhich might have interrupted the speaker, and, stretched on his couch\r\nlike the Mexican monarch on his bed of live coals, only the contortions\r\nof his cheek, and the quivering of his limbs, gave indication of his\r\nsufferings. To much of what she said he listened with stifled groans, as\r\nif he were only hearing those miseries confirmed, whose fatal reality he\r\nhad known before; but when she pursued her tale through the circumstances\r\nwhich had interrupted her journey, extreme surprise and earnest attention\r\nappeared to succeed to the symptoms of remorse which he had before\r\nexhibited. He questioned Jeanie closely concerning the appearance of the\r\ntwo men, and the conversation which she had overheard between the taller\r\nof them and the woman.\r\n\r\nWhen Jeanie mentioned the old woman having alluded to her foster-son--\xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis too true,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand the source from which I derived food, when an\r\ninfant, must have communicated to me the wretched--the fated--propensity\r\nto vices that were strangers in my own family.--But go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie passed slightly over her journey in company with Madge, having no\r\ninclination to repeat what might be the effect of mere raving on the part\r\nof her companion, and therefore her tale was now closed.\r\n\r\nYoung Staunton lay for a moment in profound meditation and at length\r\nspoke with more composure than he had yet displayed during their\r\ninterview.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a sensible, as well as a good young woman, Jeanie\r\nDeans, and I will tell you more of my story than I have told to any one.--\r\nStory did I call it?--it is a tissue of folly, guilt, and misery.--But\r\ntake notice--I do it because I desire your confidence in return--that is,\r\nthat you will act in this dismal matter by my advice and direction.\r\nTherefore do I speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do what is fitting for a sister, and a daughter, and a Christian\r\nwoman to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do not tell me any of your secrets.--It\r\nis not good that I should come into your counsel, or listen to the\r\ndoctrine which causeth to err.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimple fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at me. My head is not horned, my\r\nfoot is not cloven, my hands are not garnished with talons; and, since I\r\nam not the very devil himself, what interest can any one else have in\r\ndestroying the hopes with which you comfort or fool yourself? Listen to\r\nme patiently, and you will find that, when you have heard my counsel, you\r\nmay go to the seventh heaven with it in your pocket, if you have a mind,\r\nand not feel yourself an ounce heavier in the ascent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the risk of being somewhat heavy, as explanations usually prove, we\r\nmust here endeavour to combine into a distinct narrative, information\r\nwhich the invalid communicated in a manner at once too circumstantial,\r\nand too much broken by passion, to admit of our giving his precise words.\r\nPart of it indeed he read from a manuscript, which he had perhaps drawn\r\nup for the information of his relations after his decease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make my tale short--this wretched hag--this Margaret Murdockson, was\r\nthe wife of a favourite servant of my father--she had been my nurse--her\r\nhusband was dead--she resided in a cottage near this place--she had a\r\ndaughter who grew up, and was then a beautiful but very giddy girl; her\r\nmother endeavoured to promote her marriage with an old and wealthy churl\r\nin the neighbourhood--the girl saw me frequently--She was familiar with\r\nme, as our connection seemed to permit--and I--in a word, I wronged her\r\ncruelly--It was not so bad as your sister\xc3\xads business, but it was\r\nsufficiently villanous--her folly should have been her protection. Soon\r\nafter this I was sent abroad--To do my father justice, if I have turned\r\nout a fiend it is not his fault--he used the best means. When I returned,\r\nI found the wretched mother and daughter had fallen into disgrace, and\r\nwere chased from this country.--My deep share in their shame and misery\r\nwas discovered--my father used very harsh language--we quarrelled. I left\r\nhis house, and led a life of strange adventure, resolving never again to\r\nsee my father or my father\xc3\xads home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now comes the story!--Jeanie, I put my life into your hands, and not\r\nonly my own life, which, God knows, is not worth saving, but the\r\nhappiness of a respectable old man, and the honour of a family of\r\nconsideration. My love of low society, as such propensities as I was\r\ncursed with are usually termed, was, I think of an uncommon kind, and\r\nindicated a nature, which, if not depraved by early debauchery, would\r\nhave been fit for better things. I did not so much delight in the wild\r\nrevel, the low humour, the unconfined liberty of those with whom I\r\nassociated as in the spirit of adventure, presence of mind in peril, and\r\nsharpness of intellect which they displayed in prosecuting their\r\nmaraudings upon the revenue, or similar adventures.--Have you looked\r\nround this rectory?--is it not a sweet and pleasant retreat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie, alarmed at this sudden change of subject, replied in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I wish it had been ten thousand fathoms under ground, with its\r\nchurch-lands, and tithes, and all that belongs to it. Had it not been for\r\nthis cursed rectory, I should have been permitted to follow the bent of\r\nmy own inclinations and the profession of arms, and half the courage and\r\naddress that I have displayed among smugglers and deer-stealers would\r\nhave secured me an honourable rank among my contemporaries. Why did I not\r\ngo abroad when I left this house!--Why did I leave it at all!--why--But\r\nit came to that point with me that it is madness to look back, and misery\r\nto look forward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then proceeded with more composure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chances of a wandering life brought me unhappily to Scotland, to\r\nembroil myself in worse and more criminal actions than I had yet been\r\nconcerned in. It was now I became acquainted with Wilson, a remarkable\r\nman in his station of life; quiet, composed, and resolute, firm in mind,\r\nand uncommonly strong in person, gifted with a sort of rough eloquence\r\nwhich raised him above his companions. Hitherto I had been\r\n\r\n               As dissolute as desperate, yet through both\r\n               Were seen some sparkles of a better hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was this man\xc3\xads misfortune, as well as mine, that, notwithstanding\r\nthe difference of our rank and education, he acquired an extraordinary\r\nand fascinating influence over me, which I can only account for by the\r\ncalm determination of his character being superior to the less sustained\r\nimpetuosity of mine. Where he led I felt myself bound to follow; and\r\nstrange was the courage and address which he displayed in his pursuits.\r\nWhile I was engaged in desperate adventures, under so strange and\r\ndangerous a preceptor, I became acquainted with your unfortunate sister\r\nat some sports of the young people in the suburbs, which she frequented\r\nby stealth--and her ruin proved an interlude to the tragic scenes in\r\nwhich I was now deeply engaged. Yet this let me say--the villany was not\r\npremeditated, and I was firmly resolved to do her all the justice which\r\nmarriage could do, so soon as I should be able to extricate myself from\r\nmy unhappy course of life, and embrace some one more suited to my birth.\r\nI had wild visions--visions of conducting her as if to some poor retreat,\r\nand introducing her at once to rank and fortune she never dreamt of. A\r\nfriend, at my request, attempted a negotiation with my father, which was\r\nprotracted for some time, and renewed at different intervals. At length,\r\nand just when I expected my father\xc3\xads pardon, he learned by some means or\r\nother my infamy, painted in even exaggerated colours, which was, God\r\nknows, unnecessary. He wrote me a letter--how it found me out I know\r\nnot--enclosing me a sum of money, and disowning me for ever. I became\r\ndesperate--I became frantic--I readily joined Wilson in a perilous\r\nsmuggling adventure in which we miscarried, and was willingly blinded by\r\nhis logic to consider the robbery of the officer of the customs in Fife\r\nas a fair and honourable reprisal. Hitherto I had observed a certain line\r\nin my criminality, and stood free of assaults upon personal property, but\r\nnow I felt a wild pleasure in disgracing myself as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe plunder was no object to me. I abandoned that to my comrades, and\r\nonly asked the post of danger. I remember well that when I stood with my\r\ndrawn sword guarding the door while they committed the felony, I had not\r\na thought of my own safety. I was only meditating on my sense of supposed\r\nwrong from my family, my impotent thirst of vengeance, and how it would\r\nsound in the haughty cars of the family of Willingham, that one of their\r\ndescendants, and the heir apparent of their honours, should perish by the\r\nhands of the hangman for robbing a Scottish gauger of a sum not equal to\r\none-fifth part of the money I had in my pocket-book. We were taken--I\r\nexpected no less. We were condemned--that also I looked for. But death,\r\nas he approached nearer, looked grimly; and the recollection of your\r\nsister\xc3\xads destitute condition determined me on an effort to save my life.--\r\nI forgot to tell you, that in Edinburgh I again met the woman\r\nMurdockson and her daughter. She had followed the camp when young, and\r\nhad now, under pretence of a trifling traffic, resumed predatory habits,\r\nwith which she had already been too familiar. Our first meeting was\r\nstormy; but I was liberal of what money I had, and she forgot, or seemed\r\nto forget, the injury her daughter had received. The unfortunate girl\r\nherself seemed hardly even to know her seducer, far less to retain any\r\nsense of the injury she had received. Her mind is totally alienated,\r\nwhich, according to her mother\xc3\xads account, is sometimes the consequence of\r\nan unfavourable confinement. But it was _my doing._ Here was another\r\nstone knitted round my neck to sink me into the pit of perdition. Every\r\nlook--every word of this poor creature--her false spirits--her imperfect\r\nrecollections--her allusions to things which she had forgotten, but which\r\nwere recorded in my conscience, were stabs of a poniard--stabs did I\r\nsay?--they were tearing with hot pincers, and scalding the raw wound with\r\nburning sulphur--they were to be endured however, and they were endured.--\r\nI return to my prison thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not the least miserable of them that your sister\xc3\xads time\r\napproached. I knew her dread of you and of her father. She often said she\r\nwould die a thousand deaths ere you should know her shame--yet her\r\nconfinement must be provided for. I knew this woman Murdockson was an\r\ninfernal hag, but I thought she loved me, and that money would make her\r\ntrue. She had procured a file for Wilson, and a spring-saw for me; and\r\nshe undertook readily to take charge of Effie during her illness, in\r\nwhich she had skill enough to give the necessary assistance. I gave her\r\nthe money which my father had sent me. It was settled that she should\r\nreceive Effie into her house in the meantime, and wait for farther\r\ndirections from me, when I should effect my escape. I communicated this\r\npurpose, and recommended the old hag to poor Effie by a letter, in which\r\nI recollect that I endeavoured to support the character of Macheath under\r\ncondemnation-a fine, gay, bold-faced ruffian, who is game to the last.\r\nSuch, and so wretchedly poor, was my ambition! Yet I had resolved to\r\nforsake the courses I had been engaged in, should I be so fortunate as to\r\nescape the gibbet. My design was to marry your sister, and go over to the\r\nWest Indies. I had still a considerable sum of money left, and I trusted\r\nto be able, in one way or other, to provide for myself and my wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe made the attempt to escape, and by the obstinacy of Wilson, who\r\ninsisted upon going first, it totally miscarried. The undaunted and\r\nself-denied manner in which he sacrificed himself to redeem his error,\r\nand accomplish my escape from the Tolbooth Church, you must have heard\r\nof--all Scotland rang with it. It was a gallant and extraordinary\r\ndeed--All men spoke of it--all men, even those who most condemned the\r\nhabits and crimes of this self-devoted man, praised the heroism of his\r\nfriendship. I have many vices, but cowardice or want of gratitude, are\r\nnone of the number. I resolved to requite his generosity, and even your\r\nsister\xc3\xads safety became a secondary consideration with me for the time.\r\nTo effect Wilson\xc3\xads liberation was my principal object, and I doubted not\r\nto find the means.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I did not forget Effie neither. The bloodhounds of the law were so\r\nclose after me, that I dared not trust myself near any of my old haunts,\r\nbut old Murdockson met me by appointment, and informed me that your\r\nsister had happily been delivered of a boy. I charged the hag to keep her\r\npatient\xc3\xads mind easy, and let her want for nothing that money could\r\npurchase, and I retreated to Fife, where, among my old associates of\r\nWilson\xc3\xads gang, I hid myself in those places of concealment where the men\r\nengaged in that desperate trade are used to find security for themselves\r\nand their uncustomed goods. Men who are disobedient both to human and\r\ndivine laws are not always insensible to the claims of courage and\r\ngenerosity. We were assured that the mob of Edinburgh, strongly moved\r\nwith the hardship of Wilson\xc3\xads situation, and the gallantry of his\r\nconduct, would back any bold attempt that might be made to rescue him\r\neven from the foot of the gibbet. Desperate as the attempt seemed, upon\r\nmy declaring myself ready to lead the onset on the guard, I found no want\r\nof followers who engaged to stand by me, and returned to Lothian, soon\r\nfollowed by some steady associates, prepared to act whenever the occasion\r\nmight require.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt I should have rescued him from the very noose that\r\ndangled over his head,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued with animation, which seemed a flash\r\nof the interest which he had taken in such exploits; \xe2\x80\x9cbut amongst other\r\nprecautions, the magistrates had taken one, suggested, as we afterwards\r\nlearned, by the unhappy wretch Porteous, which effectually disconcerted\r\nmy measures. They anticipated, by half-an-hour, the ordinary period for\r\nexecution; and, as it had been resolved amongst us, that, for fear of\r\nobservation from the officers of justice, we should not show ourselves\r\nupon the street until the time of action approached, it followed, that\r\nall was over before our attempt at a rescue commenced. It did commence,\r\nhowever, and I gained the scaffold and cut the rope with my own hand. It\r\nwas too late! The bold, stouthearted, generous criminal was no more--and\r\nvengeance was all that remained to us--a vengeance, as I then thought,\r\ndoubly due from my hand, to whom Wilson had given life and liberty when\r\nhe could as easily have secured his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cdid the Scripture never come into your mind,\r\n\xc3\xabVengeance is mine, and I will repay it?\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScripture! Why, I had not opened a Bible for five years,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nStaunton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWae\xc3\xads me, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie--\xe2\x80\x9cand a minister\xc3\xads son too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is natural for you to say so; yet do not interrupt me, but let me\r\nfinish my most accursed history. The beast, Porteous, who kept firing on\r\nthe people long after it had ceased to be necessary, became the object of\r\ntheir hatred for having overdone his duty, and of mine for having done it\r\ntoo well. We that is, I and the other determined friends of Wilson,\r\nresolved to be avenged--but caution was necessary. I thought I had been\r\nmarked by one of the officers, and therefore continued to lurk about the\r\nvicinity of Edinburgh, but without daring to venture within the walls. At\r\nlength I visited, at the hazard of my life, the place where I hoped to\r\nfind my future wife and my son--they were both gone. Dame Murdockson\r\ninformed me, that so soon as Effie heard of the miscarriage of the\r\nattempt to rescue Wilson, and the hot pursuit after me, she fell into a\r\nbrain fever; and that being one day obliged to go out on some necessary\r\nbusiness and leave her alone, she had taken that opportunity to escape,\r\nand she had not seen her since. I loaded her with reproaches, to which\r\nshe listened with the most provoking and callous composure; for it is one\r\nof her attributes, that, violent and fierce as she is upon most\r\noccasions, there are some in which she shows the most imperturbable\r\ncalmness. I threatened her with justice; she said I had more reason to\r\nfear justice than she had. I felt she was right, and was silenced. I\r\nthreatened her with vengeance; she replied in nearly the same words,\r\nthat, to judge by injuries received, I had more reason to fear her\r\nvengeance, than she to dread mine. She was again right, and I was left\r\nwithout an answer. I flung myself from her in indignation, and employed a\r\ncomrade to make inquiry in the neighbourhood of Saint Leonard\xc3\xads\r\nconcerning your sister; but ere I received his answer, the opening quest\r\nof a well-scented terrier of the law drove me from the vicinity of\r\nEdinburgh, to a more distant and secluded place of concealment. A secret\r\nand trusty emissary at length brought me the account of Porteous\xc3\xads\r\ncondemnation, and of your sister\xc3\xads imprisonment on a criminal charge;\r\nthus astounding one of mine ears, while he gratified the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI again ventured to the Pleasance--again charged Murdockson with\r\ntreachery to the unfortunate Effie and her child, though I could conceive\r\nno reason, save that of appropriating the whole of the money I had lodged\r\nwith her. Your narrative throws light on this, and shows another motive,\r\nnot less powerful because less evident--the desire of wreaking vengeance\r\non the seducer of her daughter,--the destroyer at once of her reason and\r\nreputation. Great God! how I wish that, instead of the revenge she made\r\nchoice of, she had delivered me up to the cord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what account did the wretched woman give of Effie and the bairn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Jeanie, who, during this long and agitating narrative, had firmness\r\nand discernment enough to keep her eye on such points as might throw\r\nlight on her sister\xc3\xads misfortunes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would give none,\xe2\x80\x9d said Staunton; \xe2\x80\x9cshe said the mother made a\r\nmoonlight flitting from her house, with the infant in her arms--that she\r\nhad never seen either of them since--that the lass might have thrown the\r\nchild into the North Loch or the Quarry Holes for what she knew, and it\r\nwas like enough she had done so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how came you to believe that she did not speak the fatal truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Jeanie, trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, on this second occasion, I saw her daughter, and I understood\r\nfrom her, that, in fact, the child had been removed or destroyed during\r\nthe illness of the mother. But all knowledge to be got from her is so\r\nuncertain and indirect, that I could not collect any farther\r\ncircumstances. Only the diabolical character of old Murdockson makes me\r\naugur the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last account agrees with that given by my poor sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut gang on wi\xc3\xad your ain tale, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf this I am certain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Effie, in her senses, and\r\nwith her knowledge, never injured living creature.--But what could I do\r\nin her exculpation?--Nothing--and, therefore, my whole thoughts were\r\nturned toward her safety. I was under the cursed necessity of suppressing\r\nmy feelings towards Murdockson; my life was in the hag\xc3\xads hand--that I\r\ncared not for; but on my life hung that of your sister. I spoke the\r\nwretch fair; I appeared to confide in her; and to me, so far as I was\r\npersonally concerned, she gave proofs of extraordinary fidelity. I was at\r\nfirst uncertain what measures I ought to adopt for your sister\xc3\xads\r\nliberation, when the general rage excited among the citizens of Edinburgh\r\non account of the reprieve, of Porteous, suggested to me the daring idea\r\nof forcing the jail, and at once carrying off your sister from the\r\nclutches of the law, and bringing to condign punishment a miscreant, who\r\nhad tormented the unfortunate Wilson, even in the hour of death as if he\r\nhad been a wild Indian taken captive by a hostile tribe. I flung myself\r\namong the multitude in the moment of fermentation--so did others among\r\nWilson\xc3\xads mates, who had, like me, been disappointed in the hope of\r\nglutting their eyes with Porteous\xc3\xads execution. All was organised, and I\r\nwas chosen for the captain. I felt not--I do not now feel, compunction\r\nfor what was to be done, and has since been executed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, God forgive ye, sir, and bring ye to a better sense of your ways!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaimed Jeanie, in horror at the avowal of such violent sentiments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cif my sentiments are wrong. But I repeat,\r\nthat, although willing to aid the deed, I could have wished them to have\r\nchosen another leader; because I foresaw that the great and general duty\r\nof the night would interfere with the assistance which I proposed to\r\nrender Effie. I gave a commission however, to a trusty friend to protect\r\nher to a place of safety, so soon as the fatal procession had left the\r\njail. But for no persuasions which I could use in the hurry of the\r\nmoment, or which my comrade employed at more length, after the mob had\r\ntaken a different direction, could the unfortunate girl be prevailed upon\r\nto leave the prison. His arguments were all wasted upon the infatuated\r\nvictim, and he was obliged to leave her in order to attend to his own\r\nsafety. Such was his account; but, perhaps, he persevered less steadily\r\nin his attempts to persuade her than I would have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEffie was right to remain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cand I love her the better for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy will you say so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Staunton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot understand my reasons, sir, if I should render them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Jeanie composedly; \xe2\x80\x9cthey that thirst for the blood of their\r\nenemies have no taste for the well-spring of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy hopes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cwere thus a second time disappointed. My next\r\nefforts were to bring her through her trial by means of yourself. How I\r\nurged it, and where, you cannot have forgotten. I do not blame you for\r\nyour refusal; it was founded, I am convinced, on principle, and not on\r\nindifference to your sister\xc3\xads fate. For me, judge of me as a man frantic;\r\nI knew not what hand to turn to, and all my efforts were unavailing. In\r\nthis condition, and close beset on all sides, I thought of what might be\r\ndone by means of my family, and their influence. I fled from Scotland--I\r\nreached this place--my miserably wasted and unhappy appearance procured\r\nme from my father that pardon, which a parent finds it so hard to refuse,\r\neven to the most undeserving son. And here I have awaited in anguish of\r\nmind, which the condemned criminal might envy, the event of your sister\xc3\xads\r\ntrial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout taking any steps for her relief?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the last I hoped her ease might terminate more favourably; and it is\r\nonly two days since that the fatal tidings reached me. My resolution was\r\ninstantly taken. I mounted my best horse with the purpose of making the\r\nutmost haste to London and there compounding with Sir Robert Walpole for\r\nyour sister\xc3\xads safety, by surrendering to him, in the person of the heir\r\nof the family of Willingham, the notorious George Robertson, the\r\naccomplice of Wilson, the breaker of the Tolbooth prison, and the\r\nwell-known leader of the Porteous mob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut would that save my sister?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would, as I should drive my bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Staunton. \xe2\x80\x9cQueens love\r\nrevenge as well as their subjects--Little as you seem to esteem it, it is\r\na poison which pleases all palates, from the prince to the peasant. Prime\r\nministers love no less the power of gratifying sovereigns by gratifying\r\ntheir passions.--The life of an obscure village girl! Why, I might ask\r\nthe best of the crown-jewels for laying the head of such an insolent\r\nconspiracy at the foot of her majesty, with a certainty of being\r\ngratified. All my other plans have failed, but this could not--Heaven is\r\njust, however, and would not honour me with making this voluntary\r\natonement for the injury I have done your sister. I had not rode ten\r\nmiles, when my horse, the best and most sure-footed animal in this\r\ncountry, fell with me on a level piece of road, as if he had been struck\r\nby a cannon-shot. I was greatly hurt, and was brought back here in the\r\ncondition in which you now see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs young Staunton had come to the conclusion, the servant opened the\r\ndoor, and, with a voice which seemed intended rather for a signal, than\r\nmerely the announcing of a visit, said, \xe2\x80\x9cHis Reverence, sir, is coming up\r\nstairs to wait upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xc3\xads sake, hide yourself, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cin that\r\ndressing closet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cas I am here for nae ill, I canna take the shame\r\nof hiding mysell frae the master of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, good Heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed George Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cdo but consider--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEre he could complete the sentence, his father entered the apartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n             And now, will pardon, comfort, kindness, draw\r\n             The youth from vice? will honour, duty, law?\r\n                                            Crabbe.\r\n\r\nJeanie arose from her seat, and made her quiet reverence, when the elder\r\nMr. Staunton entered the apartment. His astonishment was extreme at\r\nfinding his son in such company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceive, madam, I have made a mistake respecting you, and ought to\r\nhave left the task of interrogating you, and of righting your wrongs, to\r\nthis young man, with whom, doubtless, you have been formerly acquainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads unwitting on my part that I am here;\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cthe servant\r\ntold me his master wished to speak with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere goes the purple coat over my ears,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Tummas. \xe2\x80\x9cD--n her,\r\nwhy must she needs speak the truth, when she could have as well said\r\nanything else she had a mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are still, as you have ever\r\nbeen,--lost to all self-respect, you might at least have spared your\r\nfather and your father\xc3\xads house, such a disgraceful scene as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my life--upon my soul, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, throwing his feet over\r\nthe side of the bed, and starting from his recumbent posture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour life, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted his father, with melancholy\r\nsternness,--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of life has it been?--Your soul! alas! what\r\nregard have you ever paid to it? Take care to reform both ere offering\r\neither as pledges of your sincerity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my honour, sir, you do me wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d answered George Staunton; \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nbeen all that you can call me that\xc3\xads bad, but in the present instance you\r\ndo me injustice. By my honour you do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honour!\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, and turned from him, with a look of the\r\nmost upbraiding contempt, to Jeanie. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom you, young woman, I neither\r\nask nor expect any explanation; but as a father alike and as a clergyman,\r\nI request your departure from this house. If your romantic story has been\r\nother than a pretext to find admission into it (which, from the society\r\nin which you first appeared, I may be permitted to doubt), you will find\r\na justice of peace within two miles, with whom, more properly than with\r\nme, you may lodge your complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis shall not be,\xe2\x80\x9d said George Staunton, starting up to his feet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, you are naturally kind and humane--you shall not become cruel\r\nand inhospitable on my account. Turn out that eaves-dropping rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n pointing to Thomas, \xe2\x80\x9cand get what hartshorn drops, or what better receipt\r\nyou have against fainting, and I will explain to you in two words the\r\nconnection betwixt this young woman and me. She shall not lose her fair\r\ncharacter through me. I have done too much mischief to her family\r\nalready, and I know too well what belongs to the loss of fame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave the room, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rector to the servant; and when the man\r\nhad obeyed, he carefully shut the door behind him. Then, addressing his\r\nson, he said sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, what new proof of your infamy have you\r\nto impart to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Staunton was about to speak, but it was one of those moments when\r\nthose, who, like Jeanie Deans, possess the advantage of a steady courage\r\nand unruffled temper, can assume the superiority over more ardent but\r\nless determined spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the elder Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cye have an undoubted right to ask\r\nyour ain son to render a reason of his conduct. But respecting me, I am\r\nbut a wayfaring traveller, no ways obligated or indebted to you, unless\r\nit be for the meal of meat which, in my ain country, is willingly gien by\r\nrich or poor, according to their ability, to those who need it; and for\r\nwhich, forby that, I am willing to make payment, if I didna think it\r\nwould be an affront to offer siller in a house like this--only I dinna\r\nken the fashions of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very well, young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rector, a good deal\r\nsurprised, and unable to conjecture whether to impute Jeanie\xc3\xads language\r\nto simplicity or impertinence; \xe2\x80\x9cthis may be all very well--but let me\r\nbring it to a point. Why do you stop this young man\xc3\xads mouth, and prevent\r\nhis communicating to his father and his best friend, an explanation\r\n(since he says he has one) of circumstances which seem in themselves not\r\na little suspicious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may tell of his ain affairs what he likes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my\r\nfamily and friends have nae right to hae ony stories told anent them\r\nwithout their express desire; and, as they canna be here to speak for\r\nthemselves, I entreat ye wadna ask Mr. George Rob--I mean Staunton, or\r\nwhatever his name is, ony questions anent me or my folk; for I maun be\r\nfree to tell you, that he will neither have the bearing of a Christian or\r\na gentleman, if he answers you against my express desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the most extraordinary thing I ever met with,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rector,\r\nas, after fixing his eyes keenly on the placid, yet modest countenance of\r\nJeanie, he turned them suddenly upon his son. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to say,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I feel I have been too hasty in my promise, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered George\r\nStaunton; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no title to make any communications respecting the\r\naffairs of this young person\xc3\xads family without her assent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Staunton turned his eyes from one to the other with marks\r\nof surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is more, and worse, I fear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing his son, \xe2\x80\x9cthan one\r\nof your frequent and disgraceful connections--I insist upon knowing the\r\nmystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already said, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his son, rather sullenly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nhave no title to mention the affairs of this young woman\xc3\xads family without\r\nher consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hae nae mysteries to explain, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cbut only to pray\r\nyou, as a preacher of the gospel and a gentleman, to permit me to go safe\r\nto the next public-house on the Lunnon road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take care of your safety,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Staunton \xe2\x80\x9cyou need ask\r\nthat favour from no one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you say so before my face?\xe2\x80\x9d said the justly-incensed father.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, sir, you intend to fill up the cup of disobedience and\r\nprofligacy by forming a low and disgraceful marriage? But let me bid you\r\nbeware.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were feared for sic a thing happening wi\xc3\xad me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only say, that not for all the land that lies between the twa ends\r\nof the rainbow wad I be the woman that should wed your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something very singular in all this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder Staunton;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfollow me into the next room, young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me speak first,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cI have but one word to say. I\r\nconfide entirely in your prudence; tell my father as much or as little of\r\nthese matters as you will, he shall know neither more nor less from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father darted at him a glance of indignation, which softened into\r\nsorrow as he saw him sink down on the couch, exhausted with the scene he\r\nhad undergone. He left the apartment, and Jeanie followed him, George\r\nStaunton raising himself as she passed the door-way, and pronouncing the\r\nword, \xe2\x80\x9cRemember!\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone as monitory as it was uttered by Charles I.\r\nupon the scaffold. The elder Staunton led the way into a small parlour,\r\nand shut the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something in your face and appearance\r\nthat marks both sense and simplicity, and, if I am not deceived,\r\ninnocence also--Should it be otherwise, I can only say, you are the most\r\naccomplished hypocrite I have ever seen.--I ask to know no secret that\r\nyou have unwillingness to divulge, least of all those which concern my\r\nson. His conduct has given me too much unhappiness to permit me to hope\r\ncomfort or satisfaction from him. If you are such as I suppose you,\r\nbelieve me, that whatever unhappy circumstances may have connected you\r\nwith George Staunton, the sooner you break them through the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I understand your meaning, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cand as ye are\r\nsae frank as to speak o\xc3\xad the young gentleman in sic a way, I must needs\r\nsay that it is but the second time of my speaking wi\xc3\xad him in our lives,\r\nand what I hae heard frae him on these twa occasions has been such that I\r\nnever wish to hear the like again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is your real intention to leave this part of the country, and\r\nproceed to London?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, sir; for I may say, in one sense, that the avenger of blood\r\nis behind me; and if I were but assured against mischief by the way\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clergyman, \xe2\x80\x9cafter the suspicious\r\ncharacters you described. They have left their place of rendezvous; but\r\nas they may be lurking in the neighbourhood, and as you say you have\r\nspecial reason to apprehend violence from them, I will put you under the\r\ncharge of a steady person, who will protect you as far as Stamford, and\r\nsee you into a light coach, which goes from thence to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA coach is not for the like of me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, to whom the idea\r\nof a stage-coach was unknown, as, indeed, they were then only used in the\r\nneighbourhood of London.\r\n\r\nMr. Staunton briefly explained that she would find that mode of\r\nconveyance more commodious, cheaper, and more safe, than travelling on\r\nhorseback. She expressed her gratitude with so much singleness of heart,\r\nthat he was induced to ask her whether she wanted the pecuniary means of\r\nprosecuting her journey. She thanked him, but said she had enough for her\r\npurpose; and, indeed, she had husbanded her stock with great care. This\r\nreply served also to remove some doubts, which naturally enough still\r\nfloated in Mr. Staunton\xc3\xads mind, respecting her character and real\r\npurpose, and satisfied him, at least, that money did not enter into her\r\nscheme of deception, if an impostor she should prove. He next requested\r\nto know what part of the city she wished to go to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a very decent merchant, a cousin o\xc3\xad my ain, a Mrs. Glass, sir, that\r\nsells snuff and tobacco, at the sign o\xc3\xad the Thistle, somegate in the\r\ntown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie communicated this intelligence with a feeling that a connection so\r\nrespectable ought to give her consequence in the eyes of Mr. Staunton;\r\nand she was a good deal surprised when he answered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is this woman your only acquaintance in London, my poor girl? and\r\nhave you really no better knowledge where she is to be found?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was gaun to see the Duke of Argyle, forby Mrs. Glass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand if your honour thinks it would be best to go there first, and get\r\nsome of his Grace\xc3\xads folk to show me my cousin\xc3\xads shop\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you acquainted with any of the Duke of Argyle\xc3\xads people?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nRector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer brain must be something touched after all, or it would be impossible\r\nfor her to rely on such introductions.--Well,\xe2\x80\x9d said he aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI must not\r\ninquire into the cause of your journey, and so I cannot be fit to give\r\nyou advice how to manage it. But the landlady of the house where the\r\ncoach stops is a very decent person; and as I use her house sometimes, I\r\nwill give you a recommendation to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie thanked him for his kindness with her best courtesy, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat with his honour\xc3\xads line, and ane from worthy Mrs. Bickerton, that\r\nkeeps the Seven Stars at York, she did not doubt to be well taken out in\r\nLunnon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI presume you will be desirous to set out\r\nimmediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been in an inn, sir, or any suitable resting-place,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nJeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cI wad not have presumed to use the Lord\xc3\xads day for travelling but\r\nas I am on a journey of mercy, I trust my doing so will not be imputed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may, if you choose, remain with Mrs. Dalton for the evening; but I\r\ndesire you will have no farther correspondence with my son, who is not a\r\nproper counsellor for a person of your age, whatever your difficulties\r\nmay be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honour speaks ower truly in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cit was not with my\r\nwill that I spoke wi\xc3\xad him just now, and--not to wish the gentleman\r\nonything but gude--I never wish to see him between the een again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Rector, \xe2\x80\x9cas you seem to be a seriously\r\ndisposed young woman, you may attend family worship in the hall this\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am doubtful if my attendance\r\nwould be to edification.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rector; \xe2\x80\x9cso young, and already unfortunate enough to have\r\ndoubts upon the duties of religion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cit is not for that; but I have been\r\nbred in the faith of the suffering remnant of the Presbyterian doctrine\r\nin Scotland, and I am doubtful if I can lawfully attend upon your fashion\r\nof worship, seeing it has been testified against by many precious souls\r\nof our kirk, and specially by my worthy father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my good girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rector, with a good-humoured smile, \xe2\x80\x9cfar\r\nbe it from me to put any force upon your conscience; and yet you ought to\r\nrecollect that the same divine grace dispenses its streams to other\r\nkingdoms as well as to Scotland. As it is as essential to our spiritual,\r\nas water to our earthly wants, its springs, various in character, yet\r\nalike efficacious in virtue, are to be found in abundance throughout the\r\nChristian world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cthough the waters may be alike, yet, with your\r\nworship\xc3\xads leave, the blessing upon them may not be equal. It would have\r\nbeen in vain for Naaman the Syrian leper to have bathed in Pharpar and\r\nAbana, rivers of Damascus, when it was only the waters of Jordon that\r\nwere sanctified for the cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rector, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not enter upon the great debate betwixt\r\nour national churches at present. We must endeavour to satisfy you, that,\r\nat least, amongst our errors, we preserve Christian charity, and a desire\r\nto assist our brethren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then ordered Mrs. Dalton into his presence, and consigned Jeanie to\r\nher particular charge, with directions to be kind to her, and with\r\nassurances, that, early in the morning, a trusty guide and a good horse\r\nshould be ready to conduct her to Stamford. He then took a serious and\r\ndignified, yet kind leave of her, wishing her full success in the objects\r\nof her journey, which he said he doubted not were laudable, from the\r\nsoundness of thinking which she had displayed in conversation.\r\n\r\nJeanie was again conducted by the housekeeper to her own apartment. But\r\nthe evening was not destined to pass over without farther torment from\r\nyoung Staunton. A paper was slipped into her hand by the faithful Tummas,\r\nwhich intimated his young master\xc3\xads desire, or rather demand, to see her\r\ninstantly, and assured her he had provided against interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell your young master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, openly, and regardless of all the\r\nwinks and signs by which Tummas strove to make her comprehend that Mrs.\r\nDalton was not to be admitted into the secret of the correspondence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I promised faithfully to his worthy father that I would not see him\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTummas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dalton, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you might be much more creditably\r\nemployed, considering the coat you wear, and the house you live in, than\r\nto be carrying messages between your young master and girls that chance\r\nto be in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mrs. Dalton, as to that, I was hired to carry messages, and not to\r\nask any questions about them; and it\xc3\xads not for the like of me to refuse\r\nthe young gentleman\xc3\xads bidding, if he were a little wildish or so. If\r\nthere was harm meant, there\xc3\xads no harm done, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dalton, \xe2\x80\x9cI gie you fair warning, Tummas Ditton, that\r\nan I catch thee at this work again, his Reverence shall make a clear\r\nhouse of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThomas retired, abashed and in dismay. The rest of the evening passed\r\naway without anything worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nJeanie enjoyed the comforts of a good bed and a sound sleep with grateful\r\nsatisfaction, after the perils and hardships of the preceding day; and\r\nsuch was her fatigue, that she slept soundly until six o\xc3\xadclock, when she\r\nwas awakened by Mrs. Dalton, who acquainted her that her guide and horse\r\nwere ready, and in attendance. She hastily rose, and, after her morning\r\ndevotions, was soon ready to resume her travels. The motherly care of the\r\nhousekeeper had provided an early breakfast, and, after she had partaken\r\nof this refreshment, she found herself safe seated on a pillion behind a\r\nstout Lincolnshire peasant, who was, besides, armed with pistols, to\r\nprotect her against any violence which might be offered.\r\n\r\nThey trudged along in silence for a mile or two along a country road,\r\nwhich conducted them, by hedge and gate-way, into the principal highway,\r\na little beyond Grantham. At length her master of the horse asked her\r\nwhether her name was not Jean, or Jane, Deans. She answered in the\r\naffirmative, with some surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThen here\xc3\xads a bit of a note as concerns\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, handing it over his left shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads from young\r\nmaster, as I judge, and every man about Willingham is fain to pleasure\r\nhim either for love or fear; for he\xc3\xadll come to be landlord at last, let\r\nthem say what they like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie broke the seal of the note, which was addressed to her, and read\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou refuse to see me. I suppose you are shocked at my character: but, in\r\npainting myself such as I am, you should give me credit for my sincerity.\r\nI am, at least, no hypocrite. You refuse, however, to see me, and your\r\nconduct may be natural--but is it wise? I have expressed my anxiety to\r\nrepair your sister\xc3\xads misfortunes at the expense of my honour,--my\r\nfamily\xc3\xads honour--my own life, and you think me too debased to be admitted\r\neven to sacrifice what I have remaining of honour, fame, and life, in her\r\ncause. Well, if the offerer be despised, the victim is still equally at\r\nhand; and perhaps there may be justice in the decree of Heaven, that I\r\nshall not have the melancholy credit of appearing to make this sacrifice\r\nout of my own free good-will. You, as you have declined my concurrence,\r\nmust take the whole upon yourself. Go, then, to the Duke of Argyle, and,\r\nwhen other arguments fail you, tell him you have it in your power to\r\nbring to condign punishment the most active conspirator in the Porteous\r\nmob. He will hear you on this topic, should he be deaf to every other.\r\nMake your own terms, for they will be at your own making. You know where\r\nI am to be found; and you may be assured I will not give you the dark\r\nside of the hill, as at Muschat\xc3\xads Cairn; I have no thoughts of stirring\r\nfrom the house I was born in; like the hare, I shall be worried in the\r\nseat I started from. I repeat it--make your own terms. I need not remind\r\nyou to ask your sister\xc3\xads life, for that you will do of course; but make\r\nterms of advantage for yourself--ask wealth and reward--office and income\r\nfor Butler--ask anything--you will get anything--and all for delivering\r\nto the hands of the executioner a man most deserving of his office;--one\r\nwho, though young in years, is old in wickedness, and whose most earnest\r\ndesire is, after the storms of an unquiet life, to sleep and be at rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary letter was subscribed with the initials G. S.\r\n\r\nJeanie read it over once or twice with great attention, which the slow\r\npace of the horse, as he stalked through a deep lane, enabled her to do\r\nwith facility.\r\n\r\nWhen she had perused this billet, her first employment was to tear it\r\ninto as small pieces as possible, and disperse these pieces in the air by\r\na few at a time, so that a document containing so perilous a secret might\r\nnot fall into any other person\xc3\xads hand.\r\n\r\nThe question how far, in point of extremity, she was entitled to save her\r\nsister\xc3\xads life by sacrificing that of a person who, though guilty towards\r\nthe state, had done her no injury, formed the next earnest and most\r\npainful subject of consideration. In one sense, indeed, it seemed as if\r\ndenouncing the guilt of Staunton, the cause of her sister\xc3\xads errors and\r\nmisfortunes, would have been an act of just, and even providential\r\nretribution. But Jeanie, in the strict and severe tone of morality in\r\nwhich she was educated, had to consider not only the general aspect of a\r\nproposed action, but its justness and fitness in relation to the actor,\r\nbefore she could be, according to her own phrase, free to enter upon it.\r\nWhat right had she to make a barter between the lives of Staunton and of\r\nEffie, and to sacrifice the one for the safety of the other? His\r\nguilt--that guilt for which he was amenable to the laws--was a crime\r\nagainst the public indeed, but it was not against her.\r\n\r\nNeither did it seem to her that his share in the death of Porteous,\r\nthough her mind revolted at the idea of using violence to any one, was in\r\nthe relation of a common murder, against the perpetrator of which every\r\none is called to aid the public magistrate. That violent action was\r\nblended with many circumstances, which, in the eyes of those in Jeanie\xc3\xads\r\nrank of life, if they did not altogether deprive it of the character of\r\nguilt, softened, at least, its most atrocious features. The anxiety of\r\nthe government to obtain conviction of some of the offenders, had but\r\nserved to increase the public feeling which connected the action, though\r\nviolent and irregular, with the idea of ancient national independence.\r\nThe rigorous measures adopted or proposed against the city of Edinburgh,\r\nthe ancient metropolis of Scotland--the extremely unpopular and\r\ninjudicious measure of compelling the Scottish clergy, contrary to their\r\nprinciples and sense of duty, to promulgate from the pulpit the reward\r\noffered for the discovery of the perpetrators of this slaughter, had\r\nproduced on the public mind the opposite consequences from what were\r\nintended; and Jeanie felt conscious, that whoever should lodge\r\ninformation concerning that event, and for whatsoever purpose it might be\r\ndone, it would be considered as an act of treason against the\r\nindependence of Scotland. With the fanaticism of the Scottish\r\nPresbyterians, there was always mingled a glow of national feeling, and\r\nJeanie, trembled at the idea of her name being handed down to posterity\r\nwith that of the \xe2\x80\x9cfause Monteath,\xe2\x80\x9d and one or two others, who, having\r\ndeserted and betrayed the cause of their country, are damned to perpetual\r\nremembrance and execration among its peasantry. Yet, to part with Effie\xc3\xads\r\nlife once more, when a word spoken might save it, pressed severely on the\r\nmind of her affectionate sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord support and direct me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it seems to be His\r\nwill to try me with difficulties far beyond my ain strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this thought passed through Jeanie\xc3\xads mind, her guard, tired of\r\nsilence, began to show some inclination to be communicative. He seemed a\r\nsensible, steady peasant, but not having more delicacy or prudence than\r\nis common to those in his situation, he, of course, chose the Willingham\r\nfamily as the subject of his conversation. From this man Jeanie learned\r\nsome particulars of which she had hitherto been ignorant, and which we\r\nwill briefly recapitulate for the information of the reader.\r\n\r\nThe father of George Staunton had been bred a soldier, and during service\r\nin the West Indies, had married the heiress of a wealthy planter. By this\r\nlady he had an only child, George Staunton, the unhappy young, man who\r\nhas been so often mentioned in this narrative. He passed the first part\r\nof his early youth under the charge of a doting mother, and in the\r\nsociety of negro slaves, whose study it was to gratify his every caprice.\r\nHis father was a man of worth and sense; but as he alone retained\r\ntolerable health among the officers of the regiment he belonged to, he\r\nwas much engaged with his duty. Besides, Mrs. Staunton was beautiful and\r\nwilful, and enjoyed but delicate health; so that it was difficult for a\r\nman of affection, humanity, and a quiet disposition, to struggle with her\r\non the point of her over-indulgence to an only child. Indeed, what Mr.\r\nStaunton did do towards counteracting the baneful effects of his wife\xc3\xads\r\nsystem, only tended to render it more pernicious; for every restraint\r\nimposed on the boy in his father\xc3\xads presence, was compensated by treble\r\nlicense during his absence. So that George Staunton acquired, even in\r\nchildhood, the habit of regarding his father as a rigid censor, from\r\nwhose severity he was desirous of emancipating himself as soon and\r\nabsolutely as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about ten years old, and when his mind had received all the\r\nseeds of those evil weeds which afterwards grew apace, his mother died,\r\nand his father, half heart-broken, returned to England. To sum up her\r\nimprudence and unjustifiable indulgence, she had contrived to place a\r\nconsiderable part of her fortune at her son\xc3\xads exclusive control or\r\ndisposal, in consequence of which management, George Staunton had not\r\nbeen long in England till he learned his independence, and how to abuse\r\nit. His father had endeavoured to rectify the defects of his education by\r\nplacing him in a well-regulated seminary. But although he showed some\r\ncapacity for learning, his riotous conduct soon became intolerable to his\r\nteachers. He found means (too easily afforded to all youths who have\r\ncertain expectations) of procuring such a command of money as enabled him\r\nto anticipate in boyhood the frolics and follies of a more mature age,\r\nand, with these accomplishments, he was returned on his father\xc3\xads hands as\r\na profligate boy, whose example might ruin a hundred.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Staunton, whose mind, since his wife\xc3\xads death, had been\r\ntinged with a melancholy, which certainly his son\xc3\xads conduct did not tend\r\nto dispel, had taken orders, and was inducted by his brother Sir William\r\nStaunton into the family living of Willingham. The revenue was a matter\r\nof consequence to him, for he derived little advantage from the estate of\r\nhis late wife; and his own fortune was that of a younger brother.\r\n\r\nHe took his son to reside with him at the rectory, but he soon found that\r\nhis disorders rendered him an intolerable inmate. And as the young men of\r\nhis own rank would not endure the purse-proud insolence of the Creole, he\r\nfell into that taste for low society, which is worse than \xe2\x80\x9cpressing to\r\ndeath, whipping, or hanging.\xe2\x80\x9d His father sent him abroad, but he only\r\nreturned wilder and more desperate than before. It is true, this unhappy\r\nyouth was not without his good qualities. He had lively wit, good temper,\r\nreckless generosity, and manners, which, while he was under restraint,\r\nmight pass well in society. But all these availed him nothing. He was so\r\nwell acquainted with the turf, the gaming-table, the cock-pit, and every\r\nworse rendezvous of folly and dissipation, that his mother\xc3\xads fortune was\r\nspent before he was twenty-one, and he was soon in debt and in distress.\r\nHis early history may be concluded in the words of our British Juvenal,\r\nwhen describing a similar character:--\r\n\r\n             Headstrong, determined in his own career,\r\n             He thought reproof unjust, and truth severe.\r\n                  The soul\xc3\xads disease was to its crisis come,\r\n             He first abused, and then abjured, his home;\r\n                  And when he chose a vagabond to be,\r\n             He made his shame his glory, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc3\xadll be free!\xe2\x80\x9d*\r\n                   [Crabbe\xc3\xads _Borough,_ Letter xii.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet \xc3\xabtis pity on Measter George, too,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the honest boor,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor he has an open hand, and winna let a poor body want an he has it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe virtue of profuse generosity, by which, indeed, they themselves are\r\nmost directly advantaged, is readily admitted by the vulgar as a cloak\r\nfor many sins.\r\n\r\nAt Stamford our heroine was deposited in safety by her communicative\r\nguide. She obtained a place in the coach, which, although termed a light\r\none, and accommodated with no fewer than six horses, only reached London\r\non the afternoon of the second day. The recommendation of the elder Mr.\r\nStaunton procured Jeanie a civil reception at the inn where the carriage\r\nstopped, and, by the aid of Mrs. Bickerton\xc3\xads correspondent, she found out\r\nher friend and relative Mrs. Glass, by whom she was kindly received and\r\nhospitably entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVENTH.\r\n\r\n           My name is Argyle, you may well think it strange,\r\n               To live at the court and never to change.\r\n                                Ballad.\r\n\r\nFew names deserve more honourable mention in the history of Scotland,\r\nduring this period, than that of John, Duke of Argyle and Greenwich. His\r\ntalents as a statesman and a soldier were generally admitted; he was not\r\nwithout ambition, but \xe2\x80\x9cwithout the illness that attends it\xe2\x80\x9d--without that\r\nirregularity of thought and aim, which often excites great men, in his\r\npeculiar situation, (for it was a very peculiar one), to grasp the means\r\nof raising themselves to power, at the risk of throwing a kingdom into\r\nconfusion. Pope has distinguished him as\r\n\r\n           Argyle, the state\xc3\xads whole thunder born to wield,\r\n               And shake alike the senate and the field.\r\n\r\nHe was alike free from the ordinary vices of statesmen, falsehood,\r\nnamely, and dissimulation; and from those of warriors, inordinate and\r\nviolent thirst after self-aggrandisement.\r\n\r\nScotland, his native country, stood at this time in a very precarious and\r\ndoubtful situation. She was indeed united to England, but the cement had\r\nnot had time to acquire consistence. The irritation of ancient wrongs\r\nstill subsisted, and betwixt the fretful jealousy of the Scottish, and\r\nthe supercilious disdain of the English, quarrels repeatedly occurred, in\r\nthe course of which the national league, so important to the safety of\r\nboth, was in the utmost danger of being dissolved. Scotland had, besides,\r\nthe disadvantage of being divided into intestine factions, which hated\r\neach other bitterly, and waited but a signal to break forth into action.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances, another man, with the talents and rank of Argyle,\r\nbut without a mind so happily regulated, would have sought to rise from\r\nthe earth in the whirlwind, and direct its fury. He chose a course more\r\nsafe and more honourable. Soaring above the petty distinctions of\r\nfaction, his voice was raised, whether in office or opposition, for those\r\nmeasures which were at once just and lenient. His high military talents\r\nenabled him, during the memorable year 1715, to render such services to\r\nthe House of Hanover, as, perhaps, were too great to be either\r\nacknowledged or repaid. He had employed, too, his utmost influence in\r\nsoftening the consequences of that insurrection to the unfortunate\r\ngentlemen whom a mistaken sense of loyalty had engaged in the affair, and\r\nwas rewarded by the esteem and affection of his country in an uncommon\r\ndegree. This popularity, with a discontented and warlike people, was\r\nsupposed to be a subject of jealousy at court, where the power to become\r\ndangerous is sometimes of itself obnoxious, though the inclination is not\r\nunited with it. Besides, the Duke of Argyle\xc3\xads independent and somewhat\r\nhaughty mode of expressing himself in Parliament, and acting in public,\r\nwere ill calculated to attract royal favour. He was, therefore, always\r\nrespected, and often employed; but he was not a favourite of George the\r\nSecond, his consort, or his ministers. At several different periods in\r\nhis life, the Duke might be considered as in absolute disgrace at court,\r\nalthough he could hardly be said to be a declared member of opposition.\r\nThis rendered him the dearer to Scotland, because it was usually in her\r\ncause that he incurred the displeasure of his sovereign; and upon this\r\nvery occasion of the Porteous mob, the animated and eloquent opposition\r\nwhich he had offered to the severe measures which were about to be\r\nadopted towards the city of Edinburgh, was the more gratefully received\r\nin that metropolis, as it was understood that the Duke\xc3\xads interposition\r\nhad given personal offence to Queen Caroline.\r\n\r\nHis conduct upon this occasion, as, indeed, that of all the Scottish\r\nmembers of the legislature, with one or two unworthy exceptions, had been\r\nin the highest degree spirited. The popular tradition, concerning his\r\nreply to Queen Caroline, has been given already, and some fragments of\r\nhis speech against the Porteous Bill are still remembered. He retorted\r\nupon the Chancellor, Lord Hardwicke, the insinuation that he had stated\r\nhimself in this case rather as a party than as a judge:--\xe2\x80\x9cI appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArgyle, \xe2\x80\x9cto the House--to the nation, if I can be justly branded with the\r\ninfamy of being a jobber or a partisan. Have I been a briber of votes?--a\r\nbuyer of boroughs?--the agent of corruption for any purpose, or on behalf\r\nof any party?--Consider my life; examine my actions in the field and in\r\nthe cabinet, and see where there lies a blot that can attach to my\r\nhonour. I have shown myself the friend of my country--the loyal subject\r\nof my king. I am ready to do so again, without an instant\xc3\xads regard to the\r\nfrowns or smiles of a court. I have experienced both, and am prepared\r\nwith indifference for either. I have given my reasons for opposing this\r\nbill, and have made it appear that it is repugnant to the international\r\ntreaty of union, to the liberty of Scotland, and, reflectively, to that\r\nof England, to common justice, to common sense, and to the public\r\ninterest. Shall the metropolis of Scotland, the capital of an independent\r\nnation, the residence of a long line of monarchs, by whom that noble city\r\nwas graced and dignified--shall such a city, for the fault of an obscure\r\nand unknown body of rioters, be deprived of its honours and its\r\nprivileges--its gates and its guards?--and shall a native Scotsman tamely\r\nbehold the havoc? I glory, my Lords, in opposing such unjust rigour, and\r\nreckon it my dearest pride and honour to stand up in defence of my native\r\ncountry while thus laid open to undeserved shame, and unjust spoliation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOther statesmen and orators, both Scottish and English, used the same\r\narguments, the bill was gradually stripped of its most oppressive and\r\nobnoxious clauses, and at length ended in a fine upon the city of\r\nEdinburgh in favour of Porteous\xc3\xads widow. So that, as somebody observed at\r\nthe time, the whole of these fierce debates ended in making the fortune\r\nof an old cook-maid, such having been the good woman\xc3\xads original capacity.\r\n\r\nThe court, however, did not forget the baffle they had received in this\r\naffair, and the Duke of Argyle, who had contributed so much to it, was\r\nthereafter considered as a person in disgrace. It is necessary to place\r\nthese circumstances under the reader\xc3\xads observation, both because they are\r\nconnected with the preceding and subsequent part of our narrative.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was alone in his study, when one of his gentlemen acquainted\r\nhim, that a country-girl, from Scotland, was desirous of speaking with\r\nhis Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA country-girl, and from Scotland!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat can have\r\nbrought the silly fool to London?--Some lover pressed and sent to sea, or\r\nsome stock sank in the South-Sea funds, or some such hopeful concern, I\r\nsuppose, and then nobody to manage the matter but MacCallummore,--Well,\r\nthis same popularity has its inconveniences.--However, show our\r\ncountrywoman up, Archibald--it is ill manners to keep her in attendance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA young woman of rather low stature, and whose countenance might be\r\ntermed very modest and pleasing in expression, though sun-burnt, somewhat\r\nfreckled, and not possessing regular features, was ushered into the\r\nsplendid library. She wore the tartan plaid of her country, adjusted so\r\nas partly to cover her head, and partly to fall back over her shoulders.\r\nA quantity of fair hair, disposed with great simplicity and neatness,\r\nappeared in front of her round and good-humoured face, to which the\r\nsolemnity of her errand, and her sense of the Duke\xc3\xads rank and importance,\r\ngave an appearance of deep awe, but not of slavish fear, or fluttered\r\nbashfulness. The rest of Jeanie\xc3\xads dress was in the style of Scottish\r\nmaidens of her own class; but arranged with that scrupulous attention to\r\nneatness and cleanliness, which we often find united with that purity of\r\nmind, of which it is a natural emblem.\r\n\r\nShe stopped near the entrance of the room, made her deepest reverence,\r\nand crossed her hands upon her bosom, without uttering a syllable. The\r\nDuke of Argyle advanced towards her; and, if she admired his graceful\r\ndeportment and rich dress, decorated with the orders which had been\r\ndeservedly bestowed on him, his courteous manner, and quick and\r\nintelligent cast of countenance, he on his part was not less, or less\r\ndeservedly, struck with the quiet simplicity and modesty expressed in the\r\ndress, manners, and countenance of his humble countrywoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you wish to speak with me, my bonny lass?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, using the\r\nencouraging epithet which at once acknowledged the connection betwixt\r\nthem as country-folk; \xe2\x80\x9cor did you wish to see the Duchess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy business is with your honour, my Lord--I mean your Lordship\xc3\xads Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is it, my good girl?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, in the same mild and\r\nencouraging tone of voice. Jeanie looked at the attendant. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave us,\r\nArchibald,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cand wait in the anteroom.\xe2\x80\x9d The domestic\r\nretired. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now sit down, my good lass,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9ctake your\r\nbreath--take your time, and tell me what you have got to say. I guess by\r\nyour dress, you are just come up from poor Scotland--Did you come through\r\nthe streets in your tartan plaid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9ca friend brought me in ane o\xc3\xad their street\r\ncoaches--a very decent woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, her courage increasing as she\r\nbecame familiar with the sound of her own voice in such a presence; \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nLordship\xc3\xads Grace kens her--it\xc3\xads Mrs. Glass, at the sign o\xc3\xad the Thistle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, my worthy snuff-merchant--I have always a chat with Mrs. Glass when\r\nI purchase my Scots high-dried. Well, but your business, my bonny\r\nwoman--time and tide, you know, wait for no one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honour--I beg your Lordship\xc3\xads pardon--I mean your Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d--for it\r\nmust be noticed, that this matter of addressing the Duke by his\r\nappropriate title had been anxiously inculcated upon Jeanie by her friend\r\nMrs. Glass, in whose eyes it was a matter of such importance, that her\r\nlast words, as Jeanie left the coach, were, \xe2\x80\x9cMind to say your Grace;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nJeanie, who had scarce ever in her life spoke to a person of higher\r\nquality than the Laird of Dumbiedikes, found great difficulty in\r\narranging her language according to the rules of ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, who saw her embarrassment, said, with his usual affability,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind my grace, lassie; just speak out a plain tale, and show you\r\nhave a Scots tongue in your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I am muckle obliged--Sir, I am the sister of that poor unfortunate\r\ncriminal, Effie Deans, who is ordered for execution at Edinburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of that unhappy story, I think--a case\r\nof child-murder, under a special act of parliament--Duncan Forbes\r\nmentioned it at dinner the other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was come up frae the north, sir, to see what could be done for her\r\nin the way of getting a reprieve or pardon, sir, or the like of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! my poor girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have made a long and a sad\r\njourney to very little purpose--Your sister is ordered for execution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am given to understand that there is law for reprieving her, if it\r\nis in the king\xc3\xads pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, there is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is purely in the king\xc3\xads\r\nbreast. The crime has been but too common--the Scots crown-lawyers think\r\nit is right there should be an example. Then the late disorders in\r\nEdinburgh have excited a prejudice in government against the nation at\r\nlarge, which they think can only be managed by measures of intimidation\r\nand severity. What argument have you, my poor girl, except the warmth of\r\nyour sisterly affection, to offer against all this?--What is your\r\ninterest?--What friends have you at court?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, excepting God and your Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, still keeping her\r\nground resolutely, however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cI could almost say with old Ormond, that there\r\ncould not be any, whose influence was smaller with kings and ministers.\r\nIt is a cruel part of our situation, young woman--I mean of the situation\r\nof men in my circumstances, that the public ascribe to them influence\r\nwhich they do not possess; and that individuals are led to expect from\r\nthem assistance which we have no means of rendering. But candour and\r\nplain dealing is in the power of every one, and I must not let you\r\nimagine you have resources in my influence, which do not exist, to make\r\nyour distress the heavier--I have no means of averting your sister\xc3\xads\r\nfate--She must die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must a\xc3\xad die, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cit is our common doom for our\r\nfather\xc3\xads transgression; but we shouldna hasten ilk other out o\xc3\xad the\r\nworld, that\xc3\xads what your honour kens better than me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, mildly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are all apt to blame\r\nthe law under which we immediately suffer; but you seem to have been well\r\neducated in your line of life, and you must know that it is alike the law\r\nof God and man, that the murderer shall surely die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, sir, Effie--that is, my poor sister, sir--canna be proved to be a\r\nmurderer; and if she be not, and the law take her life notwithstanding,\r\nwha is it that is the murderer then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cand I own I think the statute a very\r\nsevere one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a law-maker, sir, with your leave; and, therefore, ye have power\r\nover the law,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in my individual capacity,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cthough, as one of a\r\nlarge body, I have a voice in the legislation. But that cannot serve\r\nyou--nor have I at present, I care not who knows it, so much personal\r\ninfluence with the sovereign, as would entitle me to ask from him the\r\nmost insignificant favour. What could tempt you, young woman, to address\r\nyourself to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was yourself, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMyself?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied--\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you have never seen me before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; but a\xc3\xad the world kens that the Duke of Argyle is his country\xc3\xads\r\nfriend; and that ye fight for the right, and speak for the right, and\r\nthat there\xc3\xads nane like you in our present Israel, and so they that think\r\nthemselves wranged draw to refuge under your shadow; and if ye wunna stir\r\nto save the blood of an innocent countrywoman of your ain, what should we\r\nexpect frae southerns and strangers? And maybe I had another reason for\r\ntroubling your honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hae understood from my father, that your honour\xc3\xads house, and\r\nespecially your gudesire and his father, laid down their lives on the\r\nscaffold in the persecuting time. And my father was honoured to gie his\r\ntestimony baith in the cage and in the pillory, as is specially mentioned\r\nin the books of Peter Walker the packman, that your honour, I dare say,\r\nkens, for he uses maist partly the westland of Scotland. And, sir,\r\nthere\xc3\xads ane that takes concern in me, that wished me to gang to your\r\nGrace\xc3\xads presence, for his gudesire had done your gracious gudesire some\r\ngood turn, as ye will see frae these papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, she delivered to the Duke the little parcel which she\r\nhad received from Butler. He opened it, and, in the envelope, read with\r\nsome surprise, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabMusterroll of the men serving in the troop of that godly\r\ngentleman, Captain Salathiel Bangtext.--Obadiah Muggleton, Sin-Despise\r\nDouble-knock, Stand-fast-in-faith Gipps, Turn-to-the-right Thwack-away\xc3\xad--\r\nWhat the deuce is this? A list of Praise-God Barebone\xc3\xads Parliament I\r\nthink, or of old Noll\xc3\xads evangelical army--that last fellow should\r\nunderstand his wheelings, to judge by his name.--But what does all this\r\nmean, my girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the other paper, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, somewhat abashed at the\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, this is my unfortunate grandfather\xc3\xads hand sure enough--\xc3\xabTo all who\r\nmay have friendship for the house of Argyle, these are to certify, that\r\nBenjamin Butler, of Monk\xc3\xads regiment of dragoons, having been, under God,\r\nthe means of saving my life from four English troopers who were about, to\r\nslay me, I, having no other present means of recompense in my power, do\r\ngive him this acknowledgment, hoping that it may be useful to him or his\r\nduring these troublesome times; and do conjure my friends, tenants,\r\nkinsmen, and whoever will do aught for me, either in the Highlands or\r\nLowlands, to protect and assist the said Benjamin Butler, and his friends\r\nor family, on their lawful occasions, giving them such countenance,\r\nmaintenance, and supply, as may correspond with the benefit he hath\r\nbestowed on me; witness my hand--Lorne.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a strong injunction--This Benjamin Butler was your grandfather,\r\nI suppose?--You seem too young to have been his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was nae akin to me, sir--he was grandfather to ane--to a neighbour\xc3\xads\r\nson--to a sincere weel-wisher of mine, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d dropping her little courtesy\r\nas she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke--\xe2\x80\x9ca true-love affair. He was the\r\ngrandsire of one you are engaged to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne I _was_ engaged to, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, sighing; \xe2\x80\x9cbut this unhappy\r\nbusiness of my poor sister--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, hastily--\xe2\x80\x9che has not deserted you on that account,\r\nhas he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; he wad be the last to leave a friend in difficulties,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I maun think for him as weel as for mysell. He is a\r\nclergyman, sir, and it would not beseem him to marry the like of me, wi\xc3\xad\r\nthis disgrace on my kindred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a singular young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to me to think\r\nof every one before yourself. And have you really come up from Edinburgh\r\non foot, to attempt this hopeless solicitation for your sister\xc3\xads life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not a\xc3\xadthegither on foot, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I sometimes\r\ngot a cast in a waggon, and I had a horse from Ferrybridge, and then the\r\ncoach---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind all that,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Duke--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat reason have you\r\nfor thinking your sister innocent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she has not been proved guilty, as will appear from looking at\r\nthese papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put into his hand a note of the evidence, and copies of her sister\xc3\xads\r\ndeclaration. These papers Butler had procured after her departure, and\r\nSaddletree had them forwarded to London, to Mrs. Glass\xc3\xads care, so that\r\nJeanie found the documents, so necessary for supporting her suit, lying\r\nin readiness at her arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down in that chair, my good girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke,--\xe2\x80\x9cuntil I glance\r\nover the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, and watched with the utmost anxiety each change in his\r\ncountenance as he cast his eye through the papers briefly, yet with\r\nattention, and making memoranda as he went along. After reading them\r\nhastily over, he looked up, and seemed about to speak, yet changed his\r\npurpose, as if afraid of committing himself by giving too hasty an\r\nopinion, and read over again several passages which he had marked as\r\nbeing most important. All this he did in shorter time than can be\r\nsupposed by men of ordinary talents; for his mind was of that acute and\r\npenetrating character which discovers, with the glance of intuition, what\r\nfacts bear on the particular point that chances to be subjected to\r\nconsideration. At length he rose, after a few minutes\xc3\xad deep reflection.--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyour sister\xc3\xads case must certainly be termed a\r\nhard one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, sir, for that very word!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems contrary to the genius of British law,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\ntake that for granted which is not proved, or to punish with death for a\r\ncrime, which, for aught the prosecutor has been able to show, may not\r\nhave been committed at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d again said Jeanie, who had risen from her seat,\r\nand, with clasped hands, eyes glittering through tears, and features\r\nwhich trembled with anxiety, drank in every word which the Duke uttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, alas! my poor girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat good will my opinion do\r\nyou, unless I could impress it upon those in whose hands your sister\xc3\xads\r\nlife is placed by the law? Besides, I am no lawyer; and I must speak with\r\nsome of our Scottish gentlemen of the gown about the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but, sir, what seems reasonable to your honour, will certainly be the\r\nsame to them,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cilka man buckles his belt his\r\nain gate--you know our old Scots proverb?--But you shall not have placed\r\nthis reliance on me altogether in vain. Leave these papers with me, and\r\nyou shall hear from me to-morrow or next day. Take care to be at home at\r\nMrs. Glass\xc3\xads, and ready to come to me at a moment\xc3\xads warning. It will be\r\nunnecessary for you to give Mrs. Glass the trouble to attend you;--and by\r\nthe by, you will please to be dressed just as you are at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wad hae putten on a cap, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cbut your honour kens it\r\nisna the fashion of my country for single women; and I judged that, being\r\nsae mony hundred miles frae hame, your Grace\xc3\xads heart wad warm to the\r\ntartan,\xe2\x80\x9d looking at the corner of her plaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou judged quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the full value of the\r\nsnood; and MacCallummore\xc3\xads heart will be as cold as death can make it,\r\nwhen it does _not_ warm to the tartan. Now, go away, and don\xc3\xadt be out of\r\nthe way when I send.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie replied,--\xe2\x80\x9cThere is little fear of that, sir, for I have little\r\nheart to go to see sights amang this wilderness of black houses. But if I\r\nmight say to your gracious honour, that if ye ever condescend to speak to\r\nony ane that is of greater degree than yoursell, though maybe it isna\r\ncivil in me to say sae, just if you would think there can be nae sic odds\r\nbetween you and them, as between poor Jeanie Deans from St. Leonard\xc3\xads and\r\nthe Duke of Argyle; and so dinna be chappit back or cast down wi\xc3\xad the\r\nfirst rough answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not apt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cto mind rough answers much--Do\r\nnot you hope too much from what I have promised. I will do my best, but\r\nGod has the hearts of Kings in his own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie courtesied reverently and withdrew, attended by the Duke\xc3\xads\r\ngentleman, to her hackney-coach, with a respect which her appearance did\r\nnot demand, but which was perhaps paid to the length of the interview\r\nwith which his master had honoured her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELFTH.\r\n\r\n                        Ascend\r\n               While radiant summer opens all its pride,\r\n               Thy hill, delightful Shene! Here let us sweep\r\n                       The boundless landscape.\r\n                                             Thomson.\r\n\r\nFrom her kind and officious, but somewhat gossiping friend, Mrs. Glass,\r\nJeanie underwent a very close catechism on their road to the Strand,\r\nwhere the Thistle of the good lady flourished in full glory, and, with\r\nits legend of _Nemo me impune,_ distinguished a shop then well known to\r\nall Scottish folk of high and low degree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd were you sure aye to _say your_ Grace to him?\xe2\x80\x9d said the good old\r\nlady; \xe2\x80\x9cfor ane should make a distinction between MacCallummore and the\r\nbits o\xc3\xad southern bodies that they ca\xc3\xad lords here--there are as mony o\xc3\xad\r\nthem, Jeanie, as would gar ane think they maun cost but little fash in\r\nthe making--some of them I wadna trust wi\xc3\xad six pennies-worth of\r\nblack-rappee--some of them I wadna gie mysell the trouble to put up a\r\nhapnyworth in brown paper for--But I hope you showed your breeding to the\r\nDuke of Argyle, for what sort of folk would he think your friends in\r\nLondon, if you had been lording him, and him a Duke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didna seem muckle to mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9che kend that I was landward\r\nbred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel, weel,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the good lady. \xe2\x80\x9cHis Grace kens me weel; so I am\r\nthe less anxious about it. I never fill his snug-box but he says, \xc3\xabHow\r\nd\xc3\xadye do, good Mrs. Glass?--How are all our friends in the North?\xc3\xad or it\r\nmay be--\xc3\xabHave ye heard from the North lately?\xc3\xad And you may be sure, I\r\nmake my best courtesy, and answer, \xc3\xabMy Lord Duke, I hope your Grace\xc3\xads\r\nnoble Duchess, and your Grace\xc3\xads young ladies, are well; and I hope the\r\nsnuff continues to give your Grace satisfaction.\xc3\xad And then ye will see\r\nthe people in the shop begin to look about them; and if there\xc3\xads a\r\nScotsman, as there may be three or half-a-dozen, aff go the hats, and\r\nmony a look after him, and \xc3\xabThere goes the Prince of Scotland, God bless\r\nhim!\xc3\xad But ye have not told me yet the very words he said t\xc3\xadye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie had no intention to be quite so communicative. She had, as the\r\nreader may have observed, some of the caution and shrewdness, as well as\r\nof the simplicity of her country. She answered generally, that the Duke\r\nhad received her very compassionately, and had promised to interest\r\nhimself in her sister\xc3\xads affair, and to let her hear from him in the\r\ncourse of the next day, or the day after. She did not choose to make any\r\nmention of his having desired her to be in readiness to attend him, far\r\nless of his hint, that she should not bring her landlady. So that honest\r\nMrs. Glass was obliged to remain satisfied with the general intelligence\r\nabove mentioned, after having done all she could to extract more.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be conceived, that, on the next day, Jeanie declined all\r\ninvitations and inducements, whether of exercise or curiosity, to walk\r\nabroad, and continued to inhale the close, and somewhat professional\r\natmosphere of Mrs. Glass\xc3\xads small parlour. The latter flavour it owed to a\r\ncertain cupboard, containing, among other articles, a few canisters of\r\nreal Havannah, which, whether from respect to the manufacture, or out of\r\na reverend fear of the exciseman, Mrs. Glass did not care to trust in the\r\nopen shop below, and which communicated to the room a scent, that,\r\nhowever fragrant to the nostrils of the connoisseur, was not very\r\nagreeable to those of Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder how my cousin\xc3\xads silk manty,\r\nand her gowd watch, or ony thing in the world, can be worth sitting\r\nsneezing all her life in this little stilling room, and might walk on\r\ngreen braes if she liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Glass was equally surprised at her cousin\xc3\xads reluctance to stir\r\nabroad, and her indifference to the fine sights of London. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would\r\nalways help to pass away the time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto have something to look\r\nat, though ane was in distress.\xe2\x80\x9d But Jeanie was unpersuadable.\r\n\r\nThe day after her interview with the Duke was spent in that \xe2\x80\x9chope\r\ndelayed, which maketh the heart sick.\xe2\x80\x9d Minutes glided after\r\nminutes--hours fled after hours--it became too late to have any\r\nreasonable expectation of hearing from the Duke that day; yet the hope\r\nwhich she disowned, she could not altogether relinquish, and her heart\r\nthrobbed, and her ears tingled, with every casual sound in the shop\r\nbelow. It was in vain. The day wore away in the anxiety of protracted\r\nand fruitless expectation.\r\n\r\nThe next morning commenced in the same manner. But before noon, a\r\nwell-dressed gentleman entered Mrs. Glass\xc3\xads shop, and requested to see a\r\nyoung woman from Scotland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be my cousin Jeanie Deans, Mr. Archibald,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glass,\r\nwith a courtesy of recognisance. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any message for her from his\r\nGrace the Duke of Argyle, Mr. Archibald? I will carry it to her in a\r\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I must give her the trouble of stepping down, Mrs. Glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie--Jeanie Deans!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glass, screaming at the bottom of the\r\nlittle staircase, which ascended from the corner of the shop to the\r\nhigher regions. \xe2\x80\x9cJeanie--Jeanie Deans, I say! come down stairs instantly;\r\nhere is the Duke of Argyle\xc3\xads groom of the chambers desires to see you\r\ndirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d This was announced in a voice so loud, as to make all who\r\nchanced to be within hearing aware of the important communication.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be supposed, that Jeanie did not tarry long in adjusting\r\nherself to attend the summons, yet her feet almost failed her as she came\r\ndown stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must ask the favour of your company a little way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Archibald,\r\nwith civility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite ready, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my cousin going out, Mr. Archibald? then I will hae to go wi\xc3\xad her, no\r\ndoubt.--James Rasper--Look to the shop, James.--Mr. Archibald,\xe2\x80\x9d pushing a\r\njar towards him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou take his Grace\xc3\xads mixture, I think. Please to fill\r\nyour box, for old acquaintance\xc3\xad sake, while I get on my things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Archibald transferred a modest parcel of snuff from the jar to his\r\nown mull, but said he was obliged to decline the pleasure of Mrs. Glass\xc3\xads\r\ncompany, as his message was particularly to the young person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticularly to the young person?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glass; \xe2\x80\x9cis not that\r\nuncommon, Mr. Archibald? But his Grace is the best judge; and you are a\r\nsteady person, Mr. Archibald. It is not every one that comes from a great\r\nman\xc3\xads house I would trust my cousin with.--But, Jeanie, you must not go\r\nthrough the streets with Mr. Archibald with your tartan what-d\xc3\xadye-call-it\r\nthere upon your shoulders, as if you had come up with a drove of Highland\r\ncattle. Wait till I bring down my silk cloak. Why, we\xc3\xadll have the mob\r\nafter you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a hackney-coach in waiting, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Archibald,\r\ninterrupting the officious old lady, from whom Jeanie might otherwise\r\nhave found it difficult to escape; \xe2\x80\x9cand, I believe, I must not allow her\r\ntime for any change of dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he hurried Jeanie into the coach, while she internally praised\r\nand wondered at the easy manner in which he shifted off Mrs. Glass\xc3\xads\r\nofficious offers and inquiries, without mentioning his master\xc3\xads orders,\r\nor entering into any explanation,\r\n\r\nOn entering the coach, Mr. Archibald seated himself in the front seat\r\nopposite to our heroine, and they drove on in silence. After they had\r\ndriven nearly half-an-hour, without a word on either side, it occurred to\r\nJeanie, that the distance and time did not correspond with that which had\r\nbeen occupied by her journey on the former occasion, to and from the\r\nresidence of the Duke of Argyle. At length she could not help asking her\r\ntaciturn companion, \xe2\x80\x9cWhilk way they were going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord Duke will inform you himself, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Archibald, with\r\nthe same solemn courtesy which marked his whole demeanour. Almost as he\r\nspoke, the hackney-coach drew up, and the coachman dismounted and opened\r\nthe door. Archibald got out, and assisted Jeanie to get down. She found\r\nherself in a large turnpike road, without the bounds of London, upon the\r\nother side of which road was drawn up a plain chariot and four horses,\r\nthe panels without arms, and the servants without liveries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been punctual, I see, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke of Argyle, as\r\nArchibald opened the carriage-door. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be my companion for the\r\nrest of the way. Archibald will remain here with the hackney-coach till\r\nyour return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEre Jeanie could make answer, she found herself, to her no small\r\nastonishment, seated by the side of a duke, in a carriage which rolled\r\nforward at a rapid yet smooth rate, very different in both particulars\r\nfrom the lumbering, jolting vehicle which she had just left; and which,\r\nlumbering and jolting as it was, conveyed to one who had seldom been in a\r\ncoach before a certain feeling of dignity and importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cafter thinking as attentively on your\r\nsister\xc3\xads case as is in my power, I continue to be impressed with the\r\nbelief that great injustice may be done by the execution of her sentence.\r\nSo are one or two liberal and intelligent lawyers of both countries whom\r\nI have spoken with.--Nay, pray hear me out before you thank me.--I have\r\nalready told you my personal conviction is of little consequence, unless\r\nI could impress the same upon others. Now I have done for you what I\r\nwould certainly not have done to serve any purpose of my own--I have\r\nasked an audience of a lady whose interest with the king is deservedly\r\nvery high. It has been allowed me, and I am desirous that you should see\r\nher and speak for yourself. You have no occasion to be abashed; tell your\r\nstory simply, as you did to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to your Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, remembering Mrs. Glass\xc3\xads\r\ncharge, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am sure, since I have had the courage to speak to your\r\nGrace in poor Effie\xc3\xads cause, I have less reason to be shame-faced in\r\nspeaking to a leddy. But, sir, I would like to ken what to ca\xc3\xad her,\r\nwhether your grace or your honour, or your leddyship, as we say to lairds\r\nand leddies in Scotland, and I will take care to mind it; for I ken\r\nleddies are full mair particular than gentlemen about their titles of\r\nhonour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no occasion to call her anything but Madam. Just say what you\r\nthink is likely to make the best impression--look at me from time to\r\ntime--and if I put my hand to my cravat so--(showing her the motion)--you\r\nwill stop; but I shall only do this when you say anything that is not\r\nlikely to please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, sir, your Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cif it wasna ower muckle trouble,\r\nwad it no be better to tell me what I should say, and I could get it by\r\nheart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Jeanie, that would not have the same effect--that would be like\r\nreading a sermon, you know, which we good Presbyterians think has less\r\nunction than when spoken without book,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cJust speak as\r\nplainly and boldly to this lady, as you did to me the day before\r\nyesterday, and if you can gain her consent, I\xc3\xadll wad ye a plack, as we\r\nsay in the north, that you get the pardon from the king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he took a pamphlet from his pocket, and began to read.\r\nJeanie had good sense and tact, which constitute betwixt them that which\r\nis called natural good breeding. She interpreted the Duke\xc3\xads manoeuvre as\r\na hint that she was to ask no more questions, and she remained silent\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThe carriage rolled rapidly onwards through fertile meadows, ornamented\r\nwith splendid old oaks, and catching occasionally a glance of the\r\nmajestic mirror of a broad and placid river. After passing through a\r\npleasant village, the equipage stopped on a commanding eminence, where\r\nthe beauty of English landscape was displayed in its utmost luxuriance.\r\nHere the Duke alighted, and desired Jeanie to follow him. They paused for\r\na moment on the brow of a hill, to gaze on the unrivalled landscape which\r\nit presented. A huge sea of verdure, with crossing and intersecting\r\npromontories of massive and tufted groves, was tenanted by numberless\r\nflocks and herds, which seemed to wander unrestrained and unbounded\r\nthrough the rich pastures. The Thames, here turreted with villas, and\r\nthere garlanded with forests, moved on slowly and placidly, like the\r\nmighty monarch of the scene, to whom all its other beauties were but\r\naccessories, and bore on its bosom an hundred barks and skiffs, whose\r\nwhite sails and gaily fluttering pennons gave life to the whole.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyle was, of course, familiar with this scene; but to a man\r\nof taste it must be always new. Yet, as he paused and looked on this\r\ninimitable landscape, with the feeling of delight which it must give to\r\nthe bosom of every admirer of nature, his thoughts naturally reverted to\r\nhis own more grand, and scarce less beautiful, domains of Inverary.--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fine scene,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his companion, curious, perhaps, to\r\ndraw out her sentiments; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have nothing like it in Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads braw rich feeding for the cows, and they have a fine breed o\xc3\xad\r\ncattle here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I like just as weel to look at the\r\ncraigs of Arthur\xc3\xads Seat, and the sea coming in ayont them as at a\xc3\xad thae\r\nmuckle trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke smiled at a reply equally professional and national, and made a\r\nsignal for the carriage to remain where it was. Then adopting an\r\nunfrequented footpath, he conducted Jeanie through several complicated\r\nmazes to a postern-door in a high brick wall.\r\n\r\nIt was shut; but as the Duke tapped slightly at it, a person in waiting\r\nwithin, after reconnoitring through a small iron grate, contrived for the\r\npurpose, unlocked the door and admitted them. They entered, and it was\r\nimmediately closed and fastened behind them. This was all done quickly,\r\nthe door so instantly closing, and the person who opened it so suddenly\r\ndisappearing, that Jeanie could not even catch a glimpse of his exterior.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves at the extremity of a deep and narrow alley,\r\ncarpeted with the most verdant and close-shaven turf, which felt like\r\nvelvet under their feet, and screened from the sun by the branches of the\r\nlofty elms which united over the path, and caused it to resemble, in the\r\nsolemn obscurity of the light which they admitted, as well as from the\r\nrange of columnar stems, and intricate union of their arched branches,\r\none of the narrow side aisles in an ancient Gothic cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEETH\r\n\r\n                            I beseech you--\r\n            These tears beseech you, and these chaste hands woo you\r\n            That never yet were heaved but to things holy--\r\n            Things like yourself--You are a God above us;\r\n                  Be as a God, then, full of saving mercy!\r\n                                            The Bloody Brother.\r\n\r\nEncouraged as she was by the courteous manners of her noble countryman,\r\nit was not without a feeling of something like terror that Jeanie felt\r\nherself in a place apparently so lonely with a man of such high rank.\r\nThat she should have been permitted to wait on the Duke in his own house,\r\nand have been there received to a private interview, was in itself an\r\nuncommon and distinguished event in the annals of a life so simple as\r\nhers; but to find herself his travelling companion in a journey, and then\r\nsuddenly to be left alone with him in so secluded a situation, had\r\nsomething in it of awful mystery. A romantic heroine might have suspected\r\nand dreaded the power of her own charms; but Jeanie was too wise to let\r\nsuch a silly thought intrude on her mind. Still, however, she had a most\r\neager desire to know where she now was, and to whom she was to be\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nShe remarked that the Duke\xc3\xads dress, though still such as indicated rank\r\nand fashion (for it was not the custom of men of quality at that time to\r\ndress themselves like their own coachmen or grooms), was nevertheless\r\nplainer than that in which she had seen him upon a former occasion, and\r\nwas divested, in particular, of all those badges of external decoration\r\nwhich intimated superior consequence. In short, he was attired as plainly\r\nas any gentleman of fashion could appear in the streets of London in a\r\nmorning; and this circumstance helped to shake an opinion which Jeanie\r\nbegan to entertain, that, perhaps, he intended she should plead her cause\r\nin the presence of royalty itself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut surely,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to, herself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che wad hae putten on his braw star and garter, an he had thought o\xc3\xad\r\ncoming before the face of majesty--and after a\xc3\xad, this is mair like a\r\ngentleman\xc3\xads policy than a royal palace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was some sense in Jeanie\xc3\xads reasoning; yet she was not sufficiently\r\nmistress either of the circumstances of etiquette, or the particular\r\nrelations which existed betwixt the government and the Duke of Argyle, to\r\nform an accurate judgment. The Duke, as we have said, was at this time in\r\nopen opposition to the administration of Sir Robert Walpole, and was\r\nunderstood to be out of favour with the royal family, to whom he had\r\nrendered such important services. But it was a maxim of Queen Caroline to\r\nbear herself towards her political friends with such caution, as if there\r\nwas a possibility of their one day being her enemies, and towards\r\npolitical opponents with the same degree of circumspection, as if they\r\nmight again become friendly to her measures, Since Margaret of Anjou, no\r\nqueen-consort had exercised such weight in the political affairs of\r\nEngland, and the personal address which she displayed on many occasions,\r\nhad no small share in reclaiming from their political heresy many of\r\nthose determined Tories, who, after the reign of the Stuarts had been\r\nextinguished in the person of Queen Anne, were disposed rather to\r\ntransfer their allegiance to her brother the Chevalier de St. George,\r\nthan to acquiesce in the settlement of the crown on the Hanover family.\r\nHer husband, whose most shining quality was courage in the field of\r\nbattle, and who endured the office of King of England, without ever being\r\nable to acquire English habits, or any familiarity with English\r\ndispositions, found the utmost assistance from the address of his\r\npartner, and while he jealously affected to do everything according to\r\nhis own will and pleasure, was in secret prudent enough to take and\r\nfollow the advice of his more adroit consort. He intrusted to her the\r\ndelicate office of determining the various degrees of favour necessary to\r\nattach the wavering, or to confirm such as were already friendly, or to\r\nregain those whose good-will had been lost.\r\n\r\nWith all the winning address of an elegant, and, according to the times,\r\nan accomplished woman, Queen Caroline possessed the masculine soul of the\r\nother sex. She was proud by nature, and even her policy could not always\r\ntemper her expressions of displeasure, although few were more ready at\r\nrepairing any false step of this kind, when her prudence came up to the\r\naid of her passions. She loved the real possession of power rather than\r\nthe show of it, and whatever she did herself that was either wise or\r\npopular, she always desired that the King should have the full credit as\r\nwell as the advantage of the measure, conscious that, by adding to his\r\nrespectability, she was most likely to maintain her own. And so desirous\r\nwas she to comply with all his tastes, that, when threatened with the\r\ngout, she had repeatedly had recourse to checking the fit, by the use of\r\nthe cold bath, thereby endangering her life, that she might be able to\r\nattend the king in his walks.\r\n\r\nIt was a very consistent part of Queen Caroline\xc3\xads character, to keep up\r\nmany private correspondences with those to whom in public she seemed\r\nunfavourable, or who, for various reasons, stood ill with the court. By\r\nthis means she kept in her hands the thread of many a political intrigue,\r\nand, without pledging herself to anything, could often prevent discontent\r\nfrom becoming hatred, and opposition from exaggerating itself into\r\nrebellion. If by any accident her correspondence with such persons\r\nchanced to be observed or discovered, which she took all possible pains\r\nto prevent, it was represented as a mere intercourse of society, having\r\nno reference to politics; an answer with which even the prime minister,\r\nSir Robert Walpole, was compelled to remain satisfied, when he discovered\r\nthat the Queen had given a private audience to Pulteney, afterwards Earl\r\nof Bath, his most formidable and most inveterate enemy.\r\n\r\nIn thus maintaining occasional intercourse with several persons who\r\nseemed most alienated from the crown, it may readily be supposed that\r\nQueen Caroline had taken care not to break entirely with the Duke of\r\nArgyle. His high birth, his great talents, the estimation in which he was\r\nheld in his own country, the great services which he had rendered the\r\nhouse of Brunswick in 1715, placed him high in that rank of persons who\r\nwere not to be rashly neglected. He had, almost by his single and\r\nunassisted talents, stopped the irruption of the banded force of all the\r\nHighland chiefs; there was little doubt, that, with the slightest\r\nencouragement, he could put them all in motion, and renew the civil war;\r\nand it was well known that the most flattering overtures had been\r\ntransmitted to the Duke from the court of St. Germains. The character and\r\ntemper of Scotland was still little known, and it was considered as a\r\nvolcano, which might, indeed, slumber for a series of years, but was\r\nstill liable, at a moment the least expected, to break out into a\r\nwasteful irruption. It was, therefore, of the highest importance to\r\nretain come hold over so important a personage as the Duke of Argyle, and\r\nCaroline preserved the power of doing so by means of a lady, with whom,\r\nas wife of George II., she might have been supposed to be on less\r\nintimate terms.\r\n\r\nIt was not the least instance of the Queen\xc3\xads address, that she had\r\ncontrived that one of her principal attendants, Lady Suffolk, should\r\nunite in her own person the two apparently inconsistent characters, of\r\nher husband\xc3\xads mistress, and her own very obsequious and complaisant\r\nconfidant. By this dexterous management the Queen secured her power\r\nagainst the danger which might most have threatened it--the thwarting\r\ninfluence of an ambitious rival; and if she submitted to the\r\nmortification of being obliged to connive at her husband\xc3\xads infidelity,\r\nshe was at least guarded against what she might think its most dangerous\r\neffects, and was besides at liberty, now and then, to bestow a few civil\r\ninsults upon \xe2\x80\x9cher good Howard,\xe2\x80\x9d whom, however, in general, she treated\r\nwith great decorum.*\r\n\r\n* See Horace Walpole\xc3\xads Reminiscences.\r\n\r\nLady Suffolk lay under strong obligations to the Duke of Argyle, for\r\nreasons which may be collected from Horace Walpole\xc3\xads Reminiscences of\r\nthat reign, and through her means the Duke had some occasional\r\ncorrespondence with Queen Caroline, much interrupted, however, since the\r\npart he had taken in the debate concerning the Porteous mob, an affair\r\nwhich the Queen, though somewhat unreasonably, was disposed to resent,\r\nrather as an intended and premeditated insolence to her own person and\r\nauthority, than as a sudden ebullition of popular vengeance. Still,\r\nhowever, the communication remained open betwixt them, though it had been\r\nof late disused on both sides. These remarks will be found necessary to\r\nunderstand the scene which is about to be presented to the reader.\r\n\r\nFrom the narrow alley which they had traversed, the Duke turned into one\r\nof the same character, but broader and still longer. Here, for the first\r\ntime since they had entered these gardens, Jeanie saw persons approaching\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey were two ladies; one of whom walked a little behind the other, yet\r\nnot so much as to prevent her from hearing and replying to whatever\r\nobservation was addressed to her by the lady who walked foremost, and\r\nthat without her having the trouble to turn her person. As they advanced\r\nvery slowly, Jeanie had time to study their features and appearance. The\r\nDuke also slackened his pace, as if to give her time to collect herself,\r\nand repeatedly desired her not to be afraid. The lady who seemed the\r\nprincipal person had remarkably good features, though somewhat injured by\r\nthe small-pox, that venomous scourge which each village Esculapius\r\n(thanks to Jenner) can now tame as easily as their tutelary deity subdued\r\nthe Python. The lady\xc3\xads eyes were brilliant, her teeth good, and her\r\ncountenance formed to express at will either majesty or courtesy. Her\r\nform, though rather _embonpoint,_ was nevertheless graceful; and the\r\nelasticity and firmness of her step gave no room to suspect, what was\r\nactually the case, that she suffered occasionally from a disorder the\r\nmost unfavourable to pedestrian exercise. Her dress was rather rich than\r\ngay, and her manner commanding and noble.\r\n\r\nHer companion was of lower stature, with light brown hair and expressive\r\nblue eyes. Her features, without being absolutely regular, were perhaps\r\nmore pleasing than if they had been critically handsome. A melancholy, or\r\nat least a pensive expression, for which her lot gave too much cause,\r\npredominated when she was silent, but gave way to a pleasing and\r\ngood-humoured smile when she spoke to any one.\r\n\r\nWhen they were within twelve or fifteen yards of these ladies, the Duke\r\nmade a sign that Jeanie should stand still, and stepping forward himself,\r\nwith the grace which was natural to him, made a profound obeisance, which\r\nwas formally, yet in a dignified manner, returned by the personage whom\r\nhe approached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with an affable and condescending smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I see\r\nso great a stranger at court, as the Duke of Argyle has been of late, in\r\nas good health as his friends there and elsewhere could wish him to\r\nenjoy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat he had been perfectly well;\xe2\x80\x9d and added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\nnecessity of attending to the public business before the House, as well\r\nas the time occupied by a late journey to Scotland, had rendered him less\r\nassiduous in paying his duty at the levee and drawing-room than he could\r\nhave desired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen your Grace _can_ find time for a duty so frivolous,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nQueen, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are aware of your title to be well received. I hope my\r\nreadiness to comply with the wish which you expressed yesterday to Lady\r\nSuffolk, is, a sufficient proof that one of the royal family, at least,\r\nhas not forgotten ancient and important services, in resenting something\r\nwhich resembles recent neglect.\xe2\x80\x9d This was said apparently with great good\r\nhumour, and in a tone which expressed a desire of conciliation.\r\n\r\nThe Duke replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat he would account himself the most unfortunate of\r\nmen, if he could be supposed capable of neglecting his duty, in modes and\r\ncircumstances when it was expected, and would have been agreeable. He was\r\ndeeply gratified by the honour which her Majesty was now doing to him\r\npersonally; and he trusted she would soon perceive that it was in a\r\nmatter essential to his Majesty\xc3\xads interest that he had the boldness to\r\ngive her this trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot oblige me more, my Lord Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Queen, \xe2\x80\x9cthan by\r\ngiving me the advantage of your lights and experience on any point of the\r\nKing\xc3\xads service. Your Grace is aware, that I can only be the medium\r\nthrough which the matter is subjected to his Majesty\xc3\xads superior wisdom;\r\nbut if it is a suit which respects your Grace personally, it shall lose\r\nno support by being preferred through me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no suit of mine, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cnor have I any to\r\nprefer for myself personally, although I feel in full force my obligation\r\nto your Majesty. It is a business which concerns his Majesty, as a lover\r\nof justice and of mercy, and which, I am convinced, may be highly useful\r\nin conciliating the unfortunate irritation which at present subsists\r\namong his Majesty\xc3\xads good subjects in Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were two parts of this speech disagreeable to Caroline. In the\r\nfirst place, it removed the flattering notion she had adopted, that\r\nArgyle designed to use her personal intercession in making his peace with\r\nthe administration, and recovering the employments of which he had been\r\ndeprived; and next, she was displeased that he should talk of the\r\ndiscontents in Scotland as irritations to be conciliated, rather than\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these feelings, she answered hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cThat his\r\nMajesty has good subjects in England, my Lord Duke, he is bound to thank\r\nGod and the laws--that he has subjects in Scotland, I think he may thank\r\nGod and his sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke, though a courtier, coloured slightly, and the Queen, instantly\r\nsensible of her error, added, without displaying the least change of\r\ncountenance, and as if the words had been an original branch of the\r\nsentence--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the swords of those real Scotchmen who are friends to the\r\nHouse of Brunswick, particularly that of his Grace of Argyle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sword, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9clike that of my fathers, has been\r\nalways at the command of my lawful king, and of my native country--I\r\ntrust it is impossible to separate their real rights and interests. But\r\nthe present is a matter of more private concern, and respects the person\r\nof an obscure individual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the affair, my Lord?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Queen. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us find out what we\r\nare talking about, lest we should misconstrue and misunderstand each\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Duke of Argyle, \xe2\x80\x9cregards the fate of an\r\nunfortunate young woman in Scotland, now lying under sentence of death,\r\nfor a crime of which I think it highly probable that she is innocent. And\r\nmy humble petition to your Majesty is, to obtain your powerful\r\nintercession with the King for a pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now the Queen\xc3\xads turn to colour, and she did so over cheek and\r\nbrow, neck and bosom. She paused a moment as if unwilling to trust her\r\nvoice with the first expression of her displeasure; and on assuming the\r\nair of dignity and an austere regard of control, she at length replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord Duke, I will not ask your motives for addressing to me a\r\nrequest, which circumstances have rendered such an extraordinary one.\r\nYour road to the King\xc3\xads closet, as a peer and a privy-councillor,\r\nentitled to request an audience, was open, without giving me the pain of\r\nthis discussion. _I,_ at least, have had enough of Scotch pardons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke was prepared for this burst of indignation, and he was not\r\nshaken by it. He did not attempt a reply while the Queen was in the first\r\nheat of displeasure, but remained in the same firm, yet respectful\r\nposture, which he had assumed during the interview. The Queen, trained\r\nfrom her situation to self-command, instantly perceived the advantage she\r\nmight give against herself by yielding to passion; and added, in the same\r\ncondescending and affable tone in which she had opened the interview,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must allow me some of the privileges of the sex, my Lord; and do not\r\njudge uncharitably of me, though I am a little moved at the recollection\r\nof the gross insult and outrage done in your capital city to the royal\r\nauthority, at the very time when it was vested in my unworthy person.\r\nYour Grace cannot be surprised that I should both have felt it at the\r\ntime, and recollected it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is certainly a matter not speedily to be forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nDuke. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own poor thoughts of it have been long before your Majesty, and\r\nI must have expressed myself very ill if I did not convey my detestation\r\nof the murder which was committed under such extraordinary circumstances.\r\nI might, indeed, be so unfortunate as to differ with his Majesty\xc3\xads\r\nadvisers on the degree in which it was either just or politic to punish\r\nthe innocent instead of the guilty. But I trust your Majesty will permit\r\nme to be silent on a topic in which my sentiments have not the good\r\nfortune to coincide with those of more able men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not prosecute a topic on which we may probably differ,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nQueen. \xe2\x80\x9cOne word, however, I may say in private--you know our good Lady\r\nSuffolk is a little deaf--the Duke of Argyle, when disposed to renew his\r\nacquaintance with his master and mistress, will hardly find many topics\r\non which we should disagree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, bowing profoundly to so flattering an\r\nintimation, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall not be so unfortunate as to have found one on\r\nthe present occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must first impose on your Grace the duty of confession,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nQueen, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I grant you absolution. What is your particular interest\r\nin this young woman? She does not seem\xe2\x80\x9d (and she scanned Jeanie, as she\r\nsaid this, with the eye of a connoisseur) \xe2\x80\x9cmuch qualified to alarm my\r\nfriend the Duchess\xc3\xads jealousy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke, smiling in his turn, \xe2\x80\x9cwill\r\nallow my taste may be a pledge for me on that score.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, though she has not much the air _d\xc3\xadune grande dame,_ I suppose she\r\nis some thirtieth cousin in the terrible\r\nCHAPTER of Scottish genealogy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish some of my nearer relations had\r\nhalf her worth, honesty, and affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer name must be Campbell, at least?\xe2\x80\x9d said Queen Caroline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam; her name is not quite so distinguished, if I may be permitted\r\nto say so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but she comes from Inverary or Argyleshire?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sovereign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has never been farther north in her life than Edinburgh, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my conjectures are all ended,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Queen, \xe2\x80\x9cand your Grace must\r\nyourself take the trouble to explain the affair of your prote\xc3\xadge\xc3\xade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that precision and easy brevity which is only acquired by habitually\r\nconversing in the higher ranks of society, and which is the diametrical\r\nopposite of that protracted style of disquisition,\r\n\r\n           Which squires call potter, and which men call prose,\r\n\r\nthe Duke explained the singular law under which Effie Deans had received\r\nsentence of death, and detailed the affectionate exertions which Jeanie\r\nhad made in behalf of a sister, for whose sake she was willing to\r\nsacrifice all but truth and conscience.\r\n\r\nQueen Caroline listened with attention; she was rather fond, it must be\r\nremembered, of an argument, and soon found matter in what the Duke told\r\nher for raising difficulties to his request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears to me, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this is a severe law. But\r\nstill it is adopted upon good grounds, I am bound to suppose, as the law\r\nof the country, and the girl has been convicted under it. The very\r\npresumptions which the law construes into a positive proof of guilt exist\r\nin her case; and all that your Grace has said concerning the possibility\r\nof her innocence may be a very good argument for annulling the Act of\r\nParliament, but cannot, while it stands good, be admitted in favour of\r\nany individual convicted upon the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke saw and avoided the snare, for he was conscious, that, by\r\nreplying to the argument, he must have been inevitably led to a\r\ndiscussion, in the course of which the Queen was likely to be hardened\r\nin her own opinion, until she became obliged, out of mere respect to\r\nconsistency, to let the criminal suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jeanie and Queen Caroline--194]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould condescend to hear my poor\r\ncountrywoman herself, perhaps she may find an advocate in your own heart,\r\nmore able than I am, to combat the doubts suggested by your\r\nunderstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Queen seemed to acquiesce, and the Duke made a signal for Jeanie to\r\nadvance from the spot where she had hitherto remained watching\r\ncountenances, which were too long accustomed to suppress all apparent\r\nsigns of emotion, to convey to her any interesting intelligence. Her\r\nMajesty could not help smiling at the awe-struck manner in which the\r\nquiet demure figure of the little Scotchwoman advanced towards her, and\r\nyet more at the first sound of her broad northern accent. But Jeanie had\r\na voice low and sweetly toned, an admirable thing in woman, and eke\r\nbesought \xe2\x80\x9cher Leddyship to have pity on a poor misguided young creature,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n in tones so affecting, that, like the notes of some of her native songs,\r\nprovincial vulgarity was lost in pathos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand up, young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Queen, but in a kind tone, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell me\r\nwhat sort of a barbarous people your country-folk are, where child-murder\r\nis become so common as to require the restraint of laws like yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your Leddyship pleases,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are mony places\r\nbesides Scotland where mothers are unkind to their ain flesh and blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, that the disputes between George the Second and\r\nFrederick Prince of Wales were then at the highest, and that the\r\ngood-natured part of the public laid the blame on the Queen. She coloured\r\nhighly, and darted a glance of a most penetrating character first at\r\nJeanie, and then at the Duke. Both sustained it unmoved; Jeanie from\r\ntotal unconsciousness of the offence she had given, and the Duke from his\r\nhabitual composure. But in his heart he thought, My unlucky _protegee_\r\nhas with this luckless answer shot dead, by a kind of chance-medley, her\r\nonly hope of success.\r\n\r\nLady Suffolk, good-humouredly and skilfully, interposed in this awkward\r\ncrisis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should tell this lady,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cthe particular\r\ncauses which render this crime common in your country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome thinks it\xc3\xads the Kirk-session--that is--it\xc3\xads the--it\xc3\xads the\r\ncutty-stool, if your Leddyship pleases,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, looking down and\r\ncourtesying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Suffolk, to whom the phrase was new, and who\r\nbesides was rather deaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads the stool of repentance, madam, if it please your Leddyship,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cfor light life and conversation, and for breaking the\r\nseventh command.\xe2\x80\x9d Here she raised her eyes to the Duke, saw his hand at\r\nhis chin, and, totally unconscious of what she had said out of joint,\r\ngave double effect to the innuendo, by stopping short and looking\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\nAs for Lady Suffolk, she retired like a covering party, which, having\r\ninterposed betwixt their retreating friends and the enemy, have suddenly\r\ndrawn on themselves a fire unexpectedly severe.\r\n\r\nThe deuce take the lass, thought the Duke of Argyle to himself; there\r\ngoes another shot--and she has hit with both barrels right and left!\r\n\r\nIndeed the Duke had himself his share of the confusion, for, having acted\r\nas master of ceremonies to this innocent offender, he felt much in the\r\ncircumstances of a country squire, who, having introduced his spaniel\r\ninto a well-appointed drawing-room, is doomed to witness the disorder and\r\ndamage which arises to china and to dress-gowns, in consequence of its\r\nuntimely frolics. Jeanie\xc3\xads last chance-hit, however, obliterated the ill\r\nimpression which had arisen from the first; for her Majesty had not so\r\nlost the feelings of a wife in those of a Queen, but that she could enjoy\r\na jest at the expense of \xe2\x80\x9cher good Suffolk.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned towards the Duke\r\nof Argyle with a smile, which marked that she enjoyed the triumph, and\r\nobserved, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Scotch are a rigidly moral people.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, again applying\r\nherself to Jeanie, she asked how she travelled up from Scotland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my foot mostly, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, all that immense way upon foot?--How far can you walk in a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive-and-twenty miles and a bittock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a what?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Queen, looking towards the Duke of Argyle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd about five miles more,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was a good walker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Queen, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this shames me\r\nsadly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay your Leddyship never hae sae weary a heart, that ye canna be\r\nsensible of the weariness of the limbs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie. That came better\r\noff, thought the Duke; it\xc3\xads the first thing she has said to the purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I didna just a\xc3\xadthegither walk the haill way neither, for I had\r\nwhiles the cast of a cart; and I had the cast of a horse from\r\nFerrybridge--and divers other easements,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, cutting short her\r\nstory, for she observed the Duke made the sign he had fixed upon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all these accommodations,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Queen, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must have had a\r\nvery fatiguing journey, and, I fear, to little purpose; since, if the\r\nKing were to pardon your sister, in all probability it would do her\r\nlittle good, for I suppose your people of Edinburgh would hang her out of\r\nspite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe will sink herself now outright, thought the Duke.\r\n\r\nBut he was wrong. The shoals on which Jeanie had touched in this delicate\r\nconversation lay under ground, and were unknown to her; this rock was\r\nabove water, and she avoided it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was confident,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat baith town and country wad rejoice\r\nto see his Majesty taking compassion on a poor unfriended creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Majesty has not found it so in a late instance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Queen;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I suppose my Lord Duke would advise him to be guided by the votes of\r\nthe rabble themselves, who should be hanged and who spared?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I would advise his Majesty to be guided\r\nby his own feelings, and those of his royal consort; and then I am sure\r\npunishment will only attach itself to guilt, and even then with cautious\r\nreluctance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said her Majesty, \xe2\x80\x9call these fine speeches do not\r\nconvince me of the propriety of so soon showing any mark of favour to\r\nyour--I suppose I must not say rebellious?--but, at least, your very\r\ndisaffected and intractable metropolis. Why, the whole nation is in a\r\nleague to screen the savage and abominable murderers of that unhappy man;\r\notherwise, how is it possible but that, of so many perpetrators, and\r\nengaged in so public an action for such a length of time, one at least\r\nmust have been recognised? Even this wench, for aught I can tell, may be\r\na depositary of the secret.--Hark you, young woman, had you any friends\r\nengaged in the Porteous mob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie, happy that the question was so framed that\r\nshe could, with a good conscience, answer it in the negative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Queen, \xe2\x80\x9cif you were possessed of such a\r\nsecret, you would hold it a matter of conscience to keep it to yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would pray to be directed and guided what was the line of duty,\r\nmadam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and take that which suited your own inclinations,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it like you, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cI would hae gaen to the end of the\r\nearth to save the life of John Porteous, or any other unhappy man in his\r\ncondition; but I might lawfully doubt how far I am called upon to be the\r\navenger of his blood, though it may become the civil magistrate to do so.\r\nHe is dead and gane to his place, and they that have slain him must\r\nanswer for their ain act. But my sister, my puir sister, Effie, still\r\nlives, though her days and hours are numbered! She still lives, and a\r\nword of the King\xc3\xads mouth might restore her to a brokenhearted auld man,\r\nthat never in his daily and nightly exercise, forgot to pray that his\r\nMajesty might be blessed with a long and a prosperous reign, and that his\r\nthrone, and the throne of his posterity, might be established in\r\nrighteousness. O madam, if ever ye kend what it was to sorrow for and\r\nwith a sinning and a suffering creature, whose mind is sae tossed that\r\nshe can be neither ca\xc3\xadd fit to live or die, have some compassion on our\r\nmisery!--Save an honest house from dishonour, and an unhappy girl, not\r\neighteen years of age, from an early and dreadful death! Alas! it is not\r\nwhen we sleep soft and wake merrily ourselves that we think on other\r\npeople\xc3\xads sufferings. Our hearts are waxed light within us then, and we\r\nare for righting our ain wrangs and fighting our ain battles. But when\r\nthe hour of trouble comes to the mind or to the body--and seldom may it\r\nvisit your Leddyship--and when the hour of death comes, that comes to\r\nhigh and low--lang and late may it be yours!--Oh, my Leddy, then it isna\r\nwhat we hae dune for oursells, but what we hae dune for others, that we\r\nthink on maist pleasantly. And the thoughts that ye hae intervened to\r\nspare the puir thing\xc3\xads life will be sweeter in that hour, come when it\r\nmay, than if a word of your mouth could hang the haill Porteous mob at\r\nthe tail of ae tow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTear followed tear down Jeanie\xc3\xads cheeks, as, her features glowing and\r\nquivering with emotion, she pleaded her sister\xc3\xads cause with a pathos\r\nwhich was at once simple and solemn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is eloquence,\xe2\x80\x9d said her Majesty to the Duke of Argyle. \xe2\x80\x9cYoung\r\nwoman,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, addressing herself to Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ cannot grant a\r\npardon to your sister--but you shall not want my warm intercession with\r\nhis Majesty. Take this house-wife case,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, putting a small\r\nembroidered needle-case into Jeanie\xc3\xads hands; \xe2\x80\x9cdo not open it now, but at\r\nyour leisure--you will find something in it which will remind you that\r\nyou have had an interview with Queen Caroline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie, having her suspicions thus confirmed, dropped on her knees, and\r\nwould have expanded herself in gratitude; but the Duke who was upon\r\nthorns lest she should say more or less than just enough, touched his\r\nchin once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur business is, I think, ended for the present, my Lord Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nQueen, \xe2\x80\x9cand, I trust, to your satisfaction. Hereafter I hope to see your\r\nGrace more frequently, both at Richmond and St. James\xc3\xads.--Come Lady\r\nSuffolk, we must wish his Grace good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey exchanged their parting reverences, and the Duke, so soon as the\r\nladies had turned their backs, assisted Jeanie to rise from the ground,\r\nand conducted her back through the avenue, which she trode with the\r\nfeeling of one who walks in her sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    So soon as I can win the offended king,\r\n                    I will be known your advocate.\r\n                                             Cymbeline.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyle led the way in silence to the small postern by which\r\nthey had been admitted into Richmond Park, so long the favourite\r\nresidence of Queen Caroline. It was opened by the same half-seen janitor,\r\nand they found themselves beyond the precincts of the royal demesne.\r\nStill not a word was spoken on either side. The Duke probably wished to\r\nallow his rustic prote\xc3\xadge\xc3\xade time to recruit her faculties, dazzled and\r\nsunk with colloquy sublime; and betwixt what she had guessed, had heard,\r\nand had seen, Jeanie Deans\xc3\xads mind was too much agitated to permit her to\r\nask any questions.\r\n\r\nThey found the carriage of the Duke in the place where they had left it;\r\nand when they resumed their places, soon began to advance rapidly on\r\ntheir return to town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, breaking silence, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have every\r\nreason to congratulate yourself on the issue of your interview with her\r\nMajesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that leddy was the Queen herself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cI misdoubted it\r\nwhen I saw that your honour didna put on your hat--And yet I can hardly\r\nbelieve it, even when I heard her speak it herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was certainly Queen Caroline,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no\r\ncuriosity to see what is in the little pocket-book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the pardon will be in it, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, with the eager\r\nanimation of hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is unlikely. They seldom carry these\r\nthings about them, unless they were likely to be wanted; and, besides,\r\nher Majesty told you it was the King, not she, who was to grant it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am so confused in my mind--But\r\ndoes your honour think there is a certainty of Effie\xc3\xads pardon then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n continued she, still holding in her hand the unopened pocket-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, kings are kittle cattle to shoe behind, as we say in the north,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut his wife knows his trim, and I have not the least\r\ndoubt that the matter is quite certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, God be praised! God be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cand may the\r\ngude leddy never want the heart\xc3\xads ease she has gien me at this moment!--\r\nAnd God bless you too, my Lord!--without your help I wad ne\xc3\xader hae won\r\nnear her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke let her dwell upon this subject for a considerable time,\r\ncurious, perhaps, to see how long the feelings of gratitude would\r\ncontinue to supersede those of curiosity. But so feeble was the latter\r\nfeeling in Jeanie\xc3\xads mind, that his Grace, with whom, perhaps, it was for\r\nthe time a little stronger, was obliged once more to bring forward the\r\nsubject of the Queen\xc3\xads present. It was opened accordingly. In the inside\r\nof the case was the usual assortment of silk and needles, with scissors,\r\ntweezers, etc.; and in the pocket was a bank-bill for fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had no sooner informed Jeanie of the value of this last\r\ndocument, for she was unaccustomed to see notes for such sums, than she\r\nexpressed her regret at the mistake which had taken place. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the hussy\r\nitsell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a very valuable thing for a keepsake,\r\nwith the Queen\xc3\xads name written in the inside with her ain hand\r\ndoubtless--_Caroline_--as plain as could be, and a crown drawn aboon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe therefore tendered the bill to the Duke, requesting him to find some\r\nmode of returning it to the royal owner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no mistake in the case. Her\r\nMajesty knows you have been put to great expense, and she wishes to make\r\nit up to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure she is even ower gude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cand it glads me muckle\r\nthat I can pay back Dumbiedikes his siller, without distressing my\r\nfather, honest man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDumbiedikes! What, a freeholder of Mid-Lothian, is he not?\xe2\x80\x9d said his\r\nGrace, whose occasional residence in that county made him acquainted with\r\nmost of the heritors, as landed persons are termed in Scotland.--\xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\na house not far from Dalkeith, wears a black wig and a laced hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie, who had her reasons for being brief in her\r\nanswers upon this topic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my old friend Dumbie!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cI have thrice seen him fou,\r\nand only once heard the sound of his voice--Is he a cousin of yours,\r\nJeanie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,--my Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he must be a well-wisher, I suspect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe--yes,--my Lord, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie, blushing, and with hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! then, if the Laird starts, I suppose my friend Butler must be in\r\nsome danger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie, much more readily, but at the same time\r\nblushing much more deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a girl may be safely trusted with\r\nyour own matters, and I shall inquire no farther about them. But as to\r\nthis same pardon, I must see to get it passed through the proper forms;\r\nand I have a friend in office who will for auld lang syne, do me so much\r\nfavour. And then, Jeanie, as I shall have occasion to send an express\r\ndown to Scotland, who will travel with it safer and more swiftly than you\r\ncan do, I will take care to have it put into the proper channel;\r\nmeanwhile you may write to your friends by post of your good success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does your Honour think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will do as weel as if I\r\nwere to take my tap in my lap, and slip my ways hame again on my ain\r\nerrand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the roads are not very\r\nsafe for a single woman to travel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie internally acquiesced in this observation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have a plan for you besides. One of the Duchess\xc3\xads attendants, and\r\none of mine--your acquaintance Archibald--are going down to Inverary in a\r\nlight calash, with four horses I have bought, and there is room enough in\r\nthe carriage for you to go with them as far as Glasgow, where Archibald\r\nwill find means of sending you safely to Edinburgh.--And in the way I beg\r\nyou will teach the woman as much as you can of the mystery of\r\ncheese-making, for she is to have a charge in the dairy, and I dare swear\r\nyou are as tidy about your milk-pail as about your dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your Honour like cheese?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, with a gleam of conscious\r\ndelight as she asked the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, whose good-nature anticipated what was to\r\nfollow,--\xe2\x80\x9ccakes and cheese are a dinner for an emperor, let alone a\r\nHighlandman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, with modest confidence, and great and evident\r\nself-gratulation, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have been thought so particular in making cheese,\r\nthat some folk think it as gude as the real Dunlop; and if your honour\xc3\xads\r\nGrace wad but accept a stane or twa, blithe, and fain, and proud it wad\r\nmake us? But maybe ye may like the ewe-milk, that is, the Buckholmside*\r\ncheese better; or maybe the gait-milk, as ye come frae the\r\nHighlands--and I canna pretend just to the same skeel o\xc3\xad them; but my\r\ncousin Jean, that lives at Lockermachus in Lammermuir, I could speak to\r\nher, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* The hilly pastures of Buckholm, which the Author now surveys,--\xe2\x80\x9cNot in\r\nthe frenzy of a dreamer\xc3\xads eye,\xe2\x80\x9d--are famed for producing the best\r\newe-milk cheese in the south of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite unnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Dunlop is the very cheese of\r\nwhich I am so fond, and I will take it as the greatest favour you can do\r\nme to send one to Caroline Park. But remember, be on honour with it,\r\nJeanie, and make it all yourself, for I am a real good judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not feared,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, confidently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I may please your\r\nHonour; for I am sure you look as if you could hardly find fault wi\xc3\xad\r\nonybody that did their best; and weel is it my part, I trow, to do mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis discourse introduced a topic upon which the two travellers, though\r\nso different in rank and education, found each a good deal to say. The\r\nDuke, besides his other patriotic qualities, was a distinguished\r\nagriculturist, and proud of his knowledge in that department. He\r\nentertained Jeanie with his observations on the different breeds of\r\ncattle in Scotland, and their capacity for the dairy, and received so\r\nmuch information from her practical experience in return, that he\r\npromised her a couple of Devonshire cows in reward for the lesson. In\r\nshort his mind was so transported back to his rural employments and\r\namusements, that he sighed when his carriage stopped opposite to the old\r\nhackney-coach, which Archibald had kept in attendance at the place where\r\nthey had left it. While the coachman again bridled his lean cattle, which\r\nhad been indulged with a bite of musty hay, the Duke cautioned Jeanie not\r\nto be too communicative to her landlady concerning what had passed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cno use of speaking of matters till they are\r\nactually settled; and you may refer the good lady to Archibald, if she\r\npresses you hard with questions. She is his old acquaintance, and he\r\nknows how to manage with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then took a cordial farewell of Jeanie, and told her to be ready in\r\nthe ensuing week to return to Scotland--saw her safely established in her\r\nhackney-coach, and rolled of in his own carriage, humming a stanza of the\r\nballad which he is said to have composed:--\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cAt the sight of Dumbarton once again,\r\n                 I\xc3\xadll cock up my bonnet and march amain,\r\n                 With my claymore hanging down to my heel,\r\n                 To whang at the bannocks of barley meal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps one ought to be actually a Scotsman to conceive how ardently,\r\nunder all distinctions of rank and situation, they feel their mutual\r\nconnection with each other as natives of the same country. There are, I\r\nbelieve, more associations common to the inhabitants of a rude and wild,\r\nthan of a well-cultivated and fertile country; their ancestors have more\r\nseldom changed their place of residence; their mutual recollection of\r\nremarkable objects is more accurate; the high and the low are more\r\ninterested in each other\xc3\xads welfare; the feelings of kindred and\r\nrelationship are more widely extended, and in a word, the bonds of\r\npatriotic affection, always honourable even when a little too exclusively\r\nstrained, have more influence on men\xc3\xads feelings and actions.\r\n\r\nThe rumbling hackney-coach, which tumbled over the (then) execrable\r\nLondon pavement, at a rate very different from that which had conveyed\r\nthe ducal carriage to Richmond, at length deposited Jeanie Deans and her\r\nattendant at the national sign of the Thistle. Mrs. Glass, who had been\r\nin long and anxious expectation, now rushed, full of eager curiosity and\r\nopen-mouthed interrogation, upon our heroine, who was positively unable\r\nto sustain the overwhelming cataract of her questions, which burst forth\r\nwith the sublimity of a grand gardyloo:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad she seen the Duke, God bless him--the Duchess--the young ladies?--\r\nHad she seen the King, God bless him--the Queen--the Prince of Wales--the\r\nPrincess--or any of the rest of the royal family?--Had she got her\r\nsister\xc3\xads pardon?--Was it out and out--or was it only a commutation of\r\npunishment?--How far had she gone--where had she driven to--whom had she\r\nseen--what had been said--what had kept her so long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the various questions huddled upon each other by a curiosity so\r\neager, that it could hardly wait for its own gratification. Jeanie would\r\nhave been more than sufficiently embarrassed by this overbearing tide of\r\ninterrogations, had not Archibald, who had probably received from his\r\nmaster a hint to that purpose, advanced to her rescue. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Glass,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArchibald, \xe2\x80\x9chis Grace desired me particularly to say, that he would take\r\nit as a great favour if you would ask the young woman no questions, as he\r\nwishes to explain to you more distinctly than she can do how her affairs\r\nstand, and consult you on some matters which she cannot altogether so\r\nwell explain. The Duke will call at the Thistle to-morrow or next day for\r\nthat purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Grace is very condescending,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glass, her zeal for inquiry\r\nslaked for the present by the dexterous administration of this sugar\r\nplum--\xe2\x80\x9chis Grace is sensible that I am in a manner accountable for the\r\nconduct of my young kinswoman, and no doubt his Grace is the best judge\r\nhow far he should intrust her or me with the management of her affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Grace is quite sensible of that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Archibald, with national\r\ngravity, \xe2\x80\x9cand will certainly trust what he has to say to the most\r\ndiscreet of the two; and therefore, Mrs. Glass, his Grace relies you will\r\nspeak nothing to Mrs. Jean Deans, either of her own affairs or her\r\nsister\xc3\xads, until he sees you himself. He desired me to assure you, in the\r\nmeanwhile, that all was going on as well as your kindness could wish,\r\nMrs. Glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Grace is very kind--very considerate, certainly, Mr. Archibald--his\r\nGrace\xc3\xads commands shall be obeyed, and--But you have had a far drive, Mr.\r\nArchibald, as I guess by the time of your absence, and I guess\xe2\x80\x9d (with an\r\nengaging smile) \xe2\x80\x9cyou winna be the waur o\xc3\xad a glass of the right Rosa\r\nSolis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, Mrs. Glass,\xe2\x80\x9d said the great man\xc3\xads great man, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am\r\nunder the necessity of returning to my Lord directly.\xe2\x80\x9d And, making his\r\nadieus civilly to both cousins, he left the shop of the Lady of the\r\nThistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad your affairs have prospered so well, Jeanie, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Glass; \xe2\x80\x9cthough, indeed, there was little fear of them so soon as the\r\nDuke of Argyle was so condescending as to take them into hand. I will ask\r\nyou no questions about them, because his Grace, who is most considerate\r\nand prudent in such matters, intends to tell me all that you ken\r\nyourself, dear, and doubtless a great deal more; so that anything that\r\nmay lie heavily on your mind may be imparted to me in the meantime, as\r\nyou see it is his Grace\xc3\xads pleasure that I should be made acquainted with\r\nthe whole matter forthwith, and whether you or he tells it, will make no\r\ndifference in the world, ye ken. If I ken what he is going to say\r\nbeforehand, I will be much more ready to give my advice, and whether you\r\nor he tell me about it, cannot much signify after all, my dear. So you\r\nmay just say whatever you like, only mind I ask you no questions about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie was a little embarrassed. She thought that the communication she\r\nhad to make was perhaps the only means she might have in her power to\r\ngratify her friendly and hospitable kinswoman. But her prudence instantly\r\nsuggested that her secret interview with Queen Caroline, which seemed to\r\npass under a certain sort of mystery, was not a proper subject for the\r\ngossip of a woman like Mrs. Glass, of whose heart she had a much better\r\nopinion than of her prudence. She, therefore, answered in general, that\r\nthe Duke had had the extraordinary kindness to make very particular\r\ninquiries into her sister\xc3\xads bad affair, and that he thought he had found\r\nthe means of putting it a\xc3\xad straight again, but that he proposed to tell\r\nall that he thought about the matter to Mrs. Glass herself.\r\n\r\nThis did not quite satisfy the penetrating mistress of the Thistle.\r\nSearching as her own small rappee, she, in spite of her promise, urged\r\nJeanie with still farther questions. \xe2\x80\x9cHad she been a\xc3\xad that time at Argyle\r\nHouse? Was the Duke with her the whole time? and had she seen the\r\nDuchess? and had she seen the young ladies--and specially Lady Caroline\r\nCampbell?\xe2\x80\x9d--To these questions Jeanie gave the general reply, that she\r\nknew so little of the town that she could not tell exactly where she had\r\nbeen; that she had not seen the Duchess to her knowledge; that she had\r\nseen two ladies, one of whom, she understood, bore the name of Caroline;\r\nand more, she said, she could not tell about the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be the Duke\xc3\xads eldest daughter, Lady Caroline Campbell, there is\r\nno doubt of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glass; \xe2\x80\x9cbut doubtless, I shall know more\r\nparticularly through his Grace.--And so, as the cloth is laid in the\r\nlittle parlour above stairs, and it is past three o\xc3\xadclock, for I have\r\nbeen waiting this hour for you, and I have had a snack myself; and, as\r\nthey used to say in Scotland in my time--I do not ken if the word be used\r\nnow--there is ill talking between a full body and a fasting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Heaven first taught letters for some wretch\xc3\xads aid,--\r\n                   Some banished lover or some captive maid.\r\n                                          Pope.\r\n\r\nBy dint of unwonted labour with the pen, Jeanie Deans contrived to\r\nindite, and give to the charge of the postman on the ensuing day, no less\r\nthan three letters, an exertion altogether strange to her habits;\r\ninsomuch so, that, if milk had been plenty, she would rather have made\r\nthrice as many Dunlop cheeses. The first of them was very brief. It was\r\naddressed to George Staunton, Esq., at the Rectory, Willingham, by\r\nGrantham; the address being part of the information she had extracted\r\nfrom the communicative peasant who rode before her to Stamford. It was in\r\nthese words:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,--To prevent farder mischieves, whereof there hath been enough,\r\ncomes these: Sir, I have my sister\xc3\xads pardon from the Queen\xc3\xads Majesty,\r\nwhereof I do not doubt you will be glad, having had to say naut of\r\nmatters whereof you know the purport. So, Sir, I pray for your better\r\nwelfare in bodie and soul, and that it will please the fisycian to visit\r\nyou in His good time. Alwaies, sir, I pray you will never come again to\r\nsee my sister, whereof there has been too much. And so, wishing you no\r\nevil, but even your best good, that you may be turned from your iniquity\r\n(for why suld ye die?) I rest your humble servant to command,\r\n                                                       \xe2\x80\x9c_Ye ken wha._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next letter was to her father. It is too long altogether for\r\ninsertion, so we only give a few extracts. It commenced--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest and truly honoured father,--This comes with my duty to inform\r\nyou, that it has pleased God to redeem that captivitie of my poor sister,\r\nin respect the Queen\xc3\xads blessed Majesty, for whom we are ever bound to\r\npray, hath redeemed her soul from the slayer, granting the ransom of her,\r\nwhilk is ane pardon or reprieve. And I spoke with the Queen face to face\r\nand yet live; for she is not muckle differing from other grand leddies,\r\nsaying that she has a stately presence, and een like a blue huntin\xc3\xad\r\nhawk\xc3\xads, whilk gaed throu\xc3\xad and throu\xc3\xad me like a Highland durk--And all\r\nthis good was, alway under the Great Giver, to whom all are but\r\ninstruments, wrought forth for us by the Duk of Argile, wha is ane native\r\ntrue-hearted Scotsman, and not pridefu\xc3\xad, like other folk we ken of--and\r\nlikewise skeely enow in bestial, whereof he has promised to gie me twa\r\nDevonshire kye, of which he is enamoured, although I do still haud by the\r\nreal hawlit Airshire breed--and I have promised him a cheese; and I wad\r\nwuss ye, if Gowans, the brockit cow, has a quey, that she suld suck her\r\nfill of milk, as I am given to understand he has none of that breed, and\r\nis not scornfu\xc3\xad but will take a thing frae a puir body, that it may\r\nlighten their heart of the loading of debt that they awe him. Also his\r\nhonour the Duke will accept ane of our Dunlop cheeses, and it sall be my\r\nfaut if a better was ever yearned in Lowden.\xe2\x80\x9d--[Here follow some\r\nobservations respecting the breed of cattle, and the produce of the\r\ndairy, which it is our intention to forward to the Board of\r\nAgriculture.]--\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, these are but matters of the after-harvest,\r\nin respect of the great good which Providence hath gifted us with--and,\r\nin especial, poor Effie\xc3\xads life. And oh, my dear father, since it hath\r\npleased God to be merciful to her, let her not want your free pardon,\r\nwhilk will make her meet to be ane vessel of grace, and also a comfort to\r\nyour ain graie hairs. Dear Father, will ye let the Laird ken that we have\r\nhad friends strangely raised up to us, and that the talent whilk he lent\r\nme will be thankfully repaid. I hae some of it to the fore; and the rest\r\nof it is not knotted up in ane purse or napkin, but in ane wee bit paper,\r\nas is the fashion heir, whilk I am assured is gude for the siller. And,\r\ndear father, through Mr. Butler\xc3\xads means I hae gude friendship with the\r\nDuke, for their had been kindness between their forbears in the auld\r\ntroublesome time bye-past. And Mrs. Glass has been kind like my very\r\nmother. She has a braw house here, and lives bien and warm, wi\xc3\xad twa\r\nservant lasses, and a man and a callant in the shop. And she is to send\r\nyou doun a pound of her hie-dried, and some other tobaka, and we maun\r\nthink of some propine for her, since her kindness hath been great. And\r\nthe Duk is to send the pardun doun by an express messenger, in respect\r\nthat I canna travel sae fast; and I am to come doun wi\xc3\xad twa of his\r\nHonour\xc3\xads servants--that is, John Archibald, a decent elderly gentleman,\r\nthat says he has seen you lang syne, when ye were buying beasts in the\r\nwest frae the Laird of Aughtermuggitie--but maybe ye winna mind him--ony\r\nway, he\xc3\xads a civil man--and Mrs. Dolly Dutton, that is to be dairy-maid at\r\nInverara; and they bring me on as far as Glasgo, whilk will make it nae\r\npinch to win hame, whilk I desire of all things. May the Giver of all\r\ngood things keep ye in your outgauns and incomings, whereof devoutly\r\nprayeth your loving dauter,\r\n                                                  \xe2\x80\x9cJean Deans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe third letter was to Butler, and its tenor as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Butler.--Sir,--It will be pleasure to you to ken, that all I came\r\nfor is, thanks be to God, weel dune and to the gude end, and that your\r\nforbear\xc3\xads letter was right welcome to the Duke of Argile, and that he\r\nwrote your name down with a kylevine pen in a leathern book, whereby it\r\nseems like he will do for you either wi\xc3\xad a scule or a kirk; he has enow\r\nof baith, as I am assured. And I have seen the queen, which gave me a\r\nhussy-case out of her own hand. She had not her crown and skeptre, but\r\nthey are laid by for her, like the bairns\xc3\xad best claise, to be worn when\r\nshe needs them. And they are keepit in a tour, whilk is not like the tour\r\nof Libberton, nor yet Craigmillar, but mair like to the castell of\r\nEdinburgh, if the buildings were taen and set down in the midst of the\r\nNor\xc3\xad-Loch. Also the Queen was very bounteous, giving me a paper worth\r\nfiftie pounds, as I am assured, to pay my expenses here and back agen.\r\nSae, Master Butler, as we were aye neebours\xc3\xad bairns, forby onything else\r\nthat may hae been spoken between us, I trust you winna skrimp yoursell\r\nfor what is needfu\xc3\xad for your health, since it signifies not muckle whilk\r\no\xc3\xad us has the siller, if the other wants it. And mind this is no meant to\r\nhaud ye to onything whilk ye wad rather forget, if ye suld get a charge\r\nof a kirk or a scule, as above said. Only I hope it will be a scule, and\r\nnot a kirk, because of these difficulties anent aiths and patronages,\r\nwhilk might gang ill down wi\xc3\xad my honest father. Only if ye could compass\r\na harmonious call frae the parish of Skreegh-me-dead, as ye anes had hope\r\nof, I trow it wad please him weel; since I hae heard him say, that the\r\nroot of the matter was mair deeply hafted in that wild muirland parish\r\nthan in the Canongate of Edinburgh. I wish I had whaten books ye wanted,\r\nMr. Butler, for they hae haill houses of them here, and they are obliged\r\nto set sum out in the street, whilk are sald cheap, doubtless, to get\r\nthem out of the weather. It is a muckle place, and I hae seen sae muckle\r\nof it, that my poor head turns round. And ye ken langsyne, I am nae great\r\npen-woman, and it is near eleven o\xc3\xadclock o\xc3\xad the night. I am cumming down\r\nin good company, and safe--and I had troubles in gaun up whilk makes me\r\nblither of travelling wi\xc3\xad kend folk. My cousin, Mrs. Glass, has a braw\r\nhouse here, but a\xc3\xad thing is sae poisoned wi\xc3\xad snuff, that I am like to be\r\nscomfished whiles. But what signifies these things, in comparison of the\r\ngreat deliverance whilk has been vouchsafed to my father\xc3\xads house, in\r\nwhilk you, as our auld and dear well-wisher, will, I dout not, rejoice\r\nand be exceedingly glad. And I am, dear Mr. Butler, your sincere\r\nwell-wisher in temporal and eternal things,\r\n                                                  \xe2\x80\x9cJ. D.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter these labours of an unwonted kind, Jeanie retired to her bed, yet\r\nscarce could sleep a few minutes together, so often was she awakened by\r\nthe heart-stirring consciousness of her sister\xc3\xads safety, and so\r\npowerfully urged to deposit her burden of joy, where she had before laid\r\nher doubts and sorrows, in the warm and sincere exercises of devotion.\r\n\r\nAll the next, and all the succeeding day, Mrs. Glass fidgeted about her\r\nshop in the agony of expectation, like a pea (to use a vulgar simile\r\nwhich her profession renders appropriate) upon one of her own tobacco\r\npipes. With the third morning came the expected coach, with four servants\r\nclustered behind on the footboard, in dark brown and yellow liveries; the\r\nDuke in person, with laced coat, gold-headed cane, star and garter, all,\r\nas the story-book says, very grand.\r\n\r\nHe inquired for his little countrywoman of Mrs. Glass, but without\r\nrequesting to see her, probably because he was unwilling to give an\r\nappearance of personal intercourse betwixt them, which scandal might have\r\nmisinterpreted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Queen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mrs. Glass, \xe2\x80\x9chad taken the case\r\nof her kinswoman into her gracious consideration, and being specially\r\nmoved by the affectionate and resolute character of the elder sister, had\r\ncondescended to use her powerful intercession with his Majesty, in\r\nconsequence of which a pardon had been despatched to Scotland to Effie\r\nDeans, on condition of her banishing herself forth of Scotland for\r\nfourteen years. The King\xc3\xads Advocate had insisted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cupon this\r\nqualification of the pardon, having pointed out to his Majesty\xc3\xads\r\nministers, that, within the course of only seven years, twenty-one\r\ninstances of child-murder had occurred in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeary on him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glass, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat for needed he to have telled that\r\nof his ain country, and to the English folk abune a\xc3\xad? I used aye to think\r\nthe Advocate a douce decent man, but it is an ill bird*--begging your\r\nGrace\xc3\xads pardon for speaking of such a coorse by-word.\r\n\r\n* [It\xc3\xads an ill bird that fouls its own pest.]\r\n\r\nAnd then what is the poor lassie to do in a foreign land?--Why, wae\xc3\xads me,\r\nit\xc3\xads just sending her to play the same pranks ower again, out of sight or\r\nguidance of her friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! pooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cthat need not be anticipated. Why, she may\r\ncome up to London, or she may go over to America, and marry well for all\r\nthat is come and gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn troth, and so she may, as your Grace is pleased to intimate,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMrs. Glass; \xe2\x80\x9cand now I think upon it, there is my old correspondent in\r\nVirginia, Ephraim Buckskin, that has supplied the Thistle this forty\r\nyears with tobacco, and it is not a little that serves our turn, and he\r\nhas been writing to me this ten years to send him out a wife. The carle\r\nis not above sixty, and hale and hearty, and well to pass in the world,\r\nand a line from my hand would settle the matter, and Effie Deans\xc3\xads\r\nmisfortune (forby that there is no special occasion to speak about it)\r\nwould be thought little of there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she a pretty girl?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cher sister does not get beyond a\r\ngood comely sonsy lass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, far prettier is Effie than Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glass; \xe2\x80\x9cthough it is\r\nlong since I saw her mysell, but I hear of the Deanses by all my Lowden\r\nfriends when they come--your Grace kens we Scots are clannish bodies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cand the worse for those who\r\nmeddle with us, as your good old-fashioned sign says, Mrs. Glass. And now\r\nI hope you will approve of the measures I have taken for restoring your\r\nkinswoman to her friends.\xe2\x80\x9d These he detailed at length, and Mrs. Glass\r\ngave her unqualified approbation, with a smile and a courtesy at every\r\nsentence. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Mrs. Glass, you must tell Jeanie, I hope, she will\r\nnot forget my cheese when she gets down to Scotland. Archibald has my\r\norders to arrange all her expenses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegging your Grace\xc3\xads humble pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glass, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a pity to\r\ntrouble yourself about them; the Deanses are wealthy people in their way,\r\nand the lass has money in her pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xc3\xads all very true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you know, where MacCallummore\r\ntravels he pays all; it is our Highland privilege to take from all what\r\n_we_ want, and to give to all what _they_ want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Grace is better at giving than taking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo show you the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cI will fill my box out of\r\nthis canister without paying you a bawbee;\xe2\x80\x9d and again desiring to be\r\nremembered to Jeanie, with his good wishes for her safe journey, he\r\ndeparted, leaving Mrs. Glass uplifted in heart and in countenance, the\r\nproudest and happiest of tobacco and snuff dealers.\r\n\r\nReflectively, his Grace\xc3\xads good humour and affability had a favourable\r\neffect upon Jeanie\xc3\xads situation.--Her kinswoman, though civil and kind to\r\nher, had acquired too much of London breeding to be perfectly satisfied\r\nwith her cousin\xc3\xads rustic and national dress, and was, besides, something\r\nscandalised at the cause of her journey to London. Mrs. Glass might,\r\ntherefore, have been less sedulous in her attentions towards Jeanie, but\r\nfor the interest which the foremost of the Scottish nobles (for such, in\r\nall men\xc3\xads estimation, was the Duke of Argyle) seemed to take in her fate.\r\nNow, however, as a kinswoman whose virtues and domestic affections had\r\nattracted the notice and approbation of royalty itself, Jeanie stood to\r\nher relative in a light very different and much more favourable, and was\r\nnot only treated with kindness, but with actual observance and respect.\r\n\r\nIt depended on herself alone to have made as many visits, and seen as\r\nmany sights, as lay within Mrs. Glass\xc3\xads power to compass. But, excepting\r\nthat she dined abroad with one or two \xe2\x80\x9cfar away kinsfolk,\xe2\x80\x9d and that she\r\npaid the same respect, on Mrs. Glass\xc3\xads strong urgency, to Mrs. Deputy\r\nDabby, wife of the Worshipful Mr. Deputy Dabby, of Farringdon Without,\r\nshe did not avail herself of the opportunity. As Mrs. Dabby was the\r\nsecond lady of great rank whom Jeanie had seen in London, she used\r\nsometimes afterwards to draw a parallel betwixt her and the Queen, in\r\nwhich she observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mrs. Dabby was dressed twice as grand, and was\r\ntwice as big, and spoke twice as loud, and twice as muckle, as the Queen\r\ndid, but she hadna the same goss-hawk glance that makes the skin creep,\r\nand the knee bend; and though she had very kindly gifted her with a loaf\r\nof sugar and twa punds of tea, yet she hadna a\xc3\xadthegither the sweet look\r\nthat the Queen had when she put the needle-book into her hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie might have enjoyed the sights and novelties of this great city\r\nmore, had it not been for the qualification added to her sister\xc3\xads pardon,\r\nwhich greatly grieved her affectionate disposition. On this subject,\r\nhowever, her mind was somewhat relieved by a letter which she received in\r\nreturn of post, in answer to that which she had written to her father.\r\nWith his affectionate blessing, it brought his full approbation of the\r\nstep which she had taken, as one inspired by the immediate dictates of\r\nHeaven, and which she had been thrust upon in order that she might become\r\nthe means of safety to a perishing household.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ever a deliverance was dear and precious, this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the letter, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\na dear and precious deliverance--and if life saved can be made more sweet\r\nand savoury, it is when it cometh by the hands of those whom we hold in\r\nthe ties of affection. And do not let your heart be disquieted within\r\nyou, that this victim, who is rescued from the horns of the altar,\r\nwhereuntil she was fast bound by the chains of human law, is now to be\r\ndriven beyond the bounds of our land. Scotland is a blessed land to those\r\nwho love the ordinances of Christianity, and it is a faer land to look\r\nupon, and dear to them who have dwelt in it a\xc3\xad their days; and weel said\r\nthat judicious Christian, worthy John Livingstone, a sailor in\r\nBorrowstouness, as the famous Patrick Walker reporteth his words, that\r\nhowbeit he thought Scotland was a Gehennah of wickedness when he was at\r\nhome, yet when he was abroad, he accounted it ane paradise; for the evils\r\nof Scotland he found everywhere, and the good of Scotland he found\r\nnowhere. But we are to hold in remembrance that Scotland, though it be\r\nour native land, and the land of our fathers, is not like Goshen, in\r\nEgypt, on whilk the sun of the heavens and of the gospel shineth\r\nallenarly, and leaveth the rest of the world in utter darkness.\r\nTherefore, and also because this increase of profit at Saint Leonard\xc3\xads\r\nCrags may be a cauld waff of wind blawing from the frozen land of earthly\r\nself, where never plant of grace took root or grew, and because my\r\nconcerns make me take something ower muckle a grip of the gear of the\r\nwarld in mine arms, I receive this dispensation anent Effie as a call to\r\ndepart out of Haran, as righteous Abraham of old, and leave my father\xc3\xads\r\nkindred and my mother\xc3\xads house, and the ashes and mould of them who have\r\ngone to sleep before me, and which wait to be mingled with these auld\r\ncrazed bones of mine own. And my heart is lightened to do this, when I\r\ncall to mind the decay of active and earnest religion in this land, and\r\nsurvey the height and the depth, the length and the breadth, of national\r\ndefections, and how the love of many is waxing lukewarm and cold; and I\r\nam strengthened in this resolution to change my domicile likewise, as I\r\nhear that store-farms are to be set at an easy mail in Northumberland,\r\nwhere there are many precious souls that are of our true though suffering\r\npersuasion. And sic part of the kye or stock as I judge it fit to keep,\r\nmay be driven thither without incommodity--say about Wooler, or that\r\ngate, keeping aye a shouther to the hills,--and the rest may be sauld to\r\ngude profit and advantage, if we had grace weel to use and guide these\r\ngifts of the warld. The Laird has been a true friend on our unhappy\r\noccasions, and I have paid him back the siller for Effie\xc3\xads misfortune,\r\nwhereof Mr. Nichil Novit returned him no balance, as the Laird and I did\r\nexpect he wad hae done. But law licks up a\xc3\xad, as the common folk say. I\r\nhave had the siller to borrow out of sax purses. Mr. Saddletree advised\r\nto give the Laird of Lounsbeck a charge on his hand for a thousand merks.\r\nBut I hae nae broo\xc3\xad of charges, since that awfu\xc3\xad morning that a tout of a\r\nhorn, at the Cross of Edinburgh, blew half the faithfu\xc3\xad ministers of\r\nScotland out of their pulpits. However, I sall raise an adjudication,\r\nwhilk Mr. Saddletree says comes instead of the auld apprisings, and will\r\nnot lose weel-won gear with the like of him, if it may be helped. As for\r\nthe Queen, and the credit that she hath done to a poor man\xc3\xads daughter,\r\nand the mercy and the grace ye found with her, I can only pray for her\r\nweel-being here and hereafter, for the establishment of her house now and\r\nfor ever, upon the throne of these kingdoms. I doubt not but what you\r\ntold her Majesty, that I was the same David Deans of whom there was a\r\nsport at the Revolution, when I noited thegither the heads of twa false\r\nprophets, these ungracious Graces the prelates, as they stood on the Hie\r\nStreet, after being expelled from the Convention-parliament.*\r\n\r\n* Note P. Expulsion of the Scotch Bishops.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyle is a noble and true-hearted nobleman, who pleads the\r\ncause of the poor, and those who have none to help them; verily his\r\nreward shall not be lacking unto him.--I have, been writing of many\r\nthings, but not of that whilk lies nearest mine heart. I have seen the\r\nmisguided thing, she will be at freedom the morn, on enacted caution that\r\nshe shall leave Scotland in four weeks. Her mind is in an evil\r\nframe,--casting her eye backward on Egypt, I doubt, as if the bitter\r\nwaters of the wilderness were harder to endure than the brick furnaces,\r\nby the side of which there were savoury flesh-pots. I need not bid you\r\nmake haste down, for you are, excepting always my Great Master, my only\r\ncomfort in these straits. I charge you to withdraw your feet from the\r\ndelusion of that Vanity-fair in whilk ye are a sojourner, and not to go\r\nto their worship, whilk is an ill-mumbled mass, as it was weel termed by\r\nJames the Sext, though he afterwards, with his unhappy son, strove to\r\nbring it ower back and belly into his native kingdom, wherethrough their\r\nrace have been cut off as foam upon the water, and shall be as wanderers\r\namong the nations-see the prophecies of Hosea, ninth and seventeenth,\r\nand the same, tenth and seventh. But us and our house, let us say with\r\nthe same prophet, \xc3\xabLet us return to the Lord, for he hath torn, and he\r\nwill heal us--He hath smitten, and he will bind us up.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to say, that he approved of her proposed mode of returning\r\nby Glasgow, and entered into sundry minute particulars not necessary to\r\nbe quoted. A single line in the letter, but not the least frequently read\r\nby the party to whom it was addressed, intimated, that \xe2\x80\x9cReuben Butler had\r\nbeen as a son to him in his sorrows.\xe2\x80\x9d As David Deans scarce ever\r\nmentioned Butler before, without some gibe, more or less direct, either\r\nat his carnal gifts and learning, or at his grandfather\xc3\xads heresy, Jeanie\r\ndrew a good omen from no such qualifying clause being added to this\r\nsentence respecting him.\r\n\r\nA lover\xc3\xads hope resembles the bean in the nursery tale,--let it once take\r\nroot, and it will grow so rapidly, that in the course of a few hours the\r\ngiant Imagination builds a castle on the top, and by and by comes\r\nDisappointment with the \xe2\x80\x9ccurtal axe,\xe2\x80\x9d and hews down both the plant and\r\nthe superstructure. Jeanie\xc3\xads fancy, though not the most powerful of her\r\nfaculties, was lively enough to transport her to a wild farm in\r\nNorthumberland, well stocked with milk-cows, yeald beasts, and sheep; a\r\nmeeting-house, hard by, frequented by serious Presbyterians, who had\r\nunited in a harmonious call to Reuben Butler to be their spiritual\r\nguide--Effie restored, not to gaiety, but to cheerfulness at least--their\r\nfather, with his grey hairs smoothed down, and spectacles on his\r\nnose--herself, with the maiden snood exchanged for a matron\xc3\xads curch--all\r\narranged in a pew in the said meeting-house, listening to words of\r\ndevotion, rendered sweeter and more powerful by the affectionate ties\r\nwhich combined them with the preacher. She cherished such visions from\r\nday to day, until her residence in London began to become insupportable\r\nand tedious to her; and it was with no ordinary satisfaction that she\r\nreceived a summons from Argyle House, requiring her in two days to be\r\nprepared to join their northward party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEENTH.\r\n\r\n             One was a female, who had grievous ill\r\n             Wrought in revenge, and she enjoy\xc3\xadd it still;\r\n             Sullen she was, and threatening; in her eye\r\n             Glared the stern triumph that she dared to die.\r\n                                      Crabbe.\r\n\r\nThe summons of preparation arrived after Jeanie Deans had resided in the\r\nmetropolis about three weeks.\r\n\r\nOn the morning appointed she took a grateful farewell of Mrs. Glass, as\r\nthat good woman\xc3\xads attention to her particularly required, placed herself\r\nand her movable goods, which purchases and presents had greatly\r\nincreased, in a hackney-coach, and joined her travelling companions in\r\nthe housekeeper\xc3\xads apartment at Argyle House. While the carriage was\r\ngetting ready, she was informed that the Duke wished to speak with her;\r\nand being ushered into a splendid saloon, she was surprised to find that\r\nhe wished to present her to his lady and daughters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bring you my little countrywoman, Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d these were the words of\r\nthe introduction. \xe2\x80\x9cWith an army of young fellows, as gallant and steady\r\nas she is, and, a good cause, I would not fear two to one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, papa!\xe2\x80\x9d said a lively young lady, about twelve years old, \xe2\x80\x9cremember\r\nyou were full one to two at Sheriffmuir, and yet\xe2\x80\x9d (singing the well-known\r\nballad)--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome say that we wan, and some say that they wan,\r\nAnd some say that nane wan at a\xc3\xad, man\r\nBut of ae thing I\xc3\xadm sure, that on Sheriff-muir\r\nA battle there was that I saw, man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, little Mary turned Tory on my hands?--This will be fine news for\r\nour countrywoman to carry down to Scotland!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may all turn Tories for the thanks we have got for remaining Whigs,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the second young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, hold your peace, you discontented monkeys, and go dress your\r\nbabies; and as for the Bob of Dunblane,\r\n\r\n           \xc3\xabIf it wasna weel bobbit, weel bobbit, weel bobbit,\r\n            If it wasna weel bobbit, we\xc3\xadll bob it again.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa\xc3\xads wit is running low,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Mary: \xe2\x80\x9cthe poor gentleman is\r\nrepeating himself--he sang that on the field of battle, when he was told\r\nthe Highlanders had cut his left wing to pieces with their claymores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pull by the hair was the repartee to this sally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! brave Highlanders and bright claymores,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cwell do I\r\nwish them, \xc3\xabfor a\xc3\xad the ill they\xc3\xadve done me yet,\xc3\xad as the song goes.--But\r\ncome, madcaps, say a civil word to your countrywoman--I wish ye had half\r\nher canny hamely sense; I think you may be as leal and true-hearted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duchess advanced, and, in a few words, in which there was as much\r\nkindness as civility, assured Jeanie of the respect which she had for a\r\ncharacter so affectionate, and yet so firm, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you get\r\nhome, you will perhaps hear from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd from me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd from me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd from me, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d added the young\r\nladies one after the other, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you are a credit to the land we love so\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie, overpowered by these unexpected compliments, and not aware that\r\nthe Duke\xc3\xads investigation had made him acquainted with her behaviour on\r\nher sister\xc3\xads trial, could only answer by blushing, and courtesying round\r\nand round, and uttering at intervals, \xe2\x80\x9cMony thanks! mony thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must have _doch an\xc3\xad dorroch,_ or you will\r\nbe unable to travel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a salver with cake and wine on the table. He took up a glass,\r\ndrank \xe2\x80\x9cto all true hearts that lo\xc3\xaded Scotland,\xe2\x80\x9d and offered a glass to\r\nhis guest.\r\n\r\nJeanie, however, declined it, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she had never tasted wine in\r\nher life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow comes that, Jeanie?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke,--\xe2\x80\x9cwine maketh glad the heart,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sir, but my father is like Jonadab the son of Rechab, who charged\r\nhis children that they should drink no wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought your father would have had more sense,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cunless\r\nindeed he prefers brandy. But, however, Jeanie, if you will not drink,\r\nyou must eat, to save the character of my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thrust upon her a large piece of cake, nor would he permit her to\r\nbreak off a fragment, and lay the rest on a salver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it in your pouch, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be glad of it before\r\nyou see St. Giles\xc3\xads steeple. I wish to Heaven I were to see it as soon as\r\nyou! and so my best service to all my friends at and about Auld Reekie,\r\nand a blithe journey to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, mixing the frankness of a soldier with his natural affability, he\r\nshook hands with his prote\xc3\xadge\xc3\xade, and committed her to the charge of\r\nArchibald, satisfied that he had provided sufficiently for her being\r\nattended to by his domestics, from the unusual attention with which he\r\nhad himself treated her.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in the course of her journey, she found both her companions\r\ndisposed to pay her every possible civility, so that her return, in point\r\nof comfort and safety, formed a strong contrast to her journey to London.\r\n\r\nHer heart also was disburdened of the weight of grief, shame,\r\napprehension, and fear, which had loaded her before her interview with\r\nthe Queen at Richmond. But the human mind is so strangely capricious,\r\nthat, when freed from the pressure of real misery, it becomes open and\r\nsensitive to the apprehension of ideal calamities. She was now much\r\ndisturbed in mind, that she had heard nothing from Reuben Butler, to whom\r\nthe operation of writing was so much more familiar than it was to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have cost him sae little fash,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I hae\r\nseen his pen gan as fast ower the paper, as ever it did ower the water\r\nwhen it was in the grey goose\xc3\xads wing. Wae\xc3\xads me! maybe he may be\r\nbadly--but then my father wad likely hae said somethin about it--Or\r\nmaybe he may hae taen the rue, and kensna how to let me wot of his\r\nchange of mind. He needna be at muckle fash about it,\xe2\x80\x9d--she went on,\r\ndrawing herself up, though the tear of honest pride and injured\r\naffection gathered in her eye, as she entertained the suspicion,--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie Deans is no the lass to pu\xc3\xad him by the sleeve, or put him in\r\nmind of what he wishes to forget. I shall wish him weel and happy a\xc3\xad the\r\nsame; and if he has the luck to get a kirk in our country, I sall gang\r\nand hear him just the very same, to show that I bear nae malice.\xe2\x80\x9d And as\r\nshe imagined the scene, the tear stole over her eye.\r\n\r\nIn these melancholy reveries, Jeanie had full time to indulge herself;\r\nfor her travelling companions, servants in a distinguished and\r\nfashionable family, had, of course, many topics of conversation, in which\r\nit was absolutely impossible she could have either pleasure or portion.\r\nShe had, therefore, abundant leisure for reflection, and even for\r\nself-tormenting, during the several days which, indulging the young\r\nhorses the Duke was sending down to the North with sufficient ease and\r\nshort stages, they occupied in reaching the neighbourhood of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nIn approaching the vicinity of that ancient city, they discerned a\r\nconsiderable crowd upon an eminence at a little distance from the high\r\nroad, and learned from some passengers who were gathering towards that\r\nbusy scene from the southward, that the cause of the concourse was, the\r\nlaudable public desire \xe2\x80\x9cto see a doomed Scotch witch and thief get half\r\nof her due upo\xc3\xad Haribeebroo\xc3\xad yonder, for she was only to be hanged; she\r\nshould hae been boorned aloive, an\xc3\xad cheap on\xc3\xadt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Archibald,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dame of the dairy elect, \xe2\x80\x9cI never seed a\r\nwoman hanged in a\xc3\xad my life, and only four men, as made a goodly\r\nspectacle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Archibald, however, was a Scotchman, and promised himself no\r\nexuberant pleasure in seeing his countrywoman undergo \xe2\x80\x9cthe terrible\r\nbehests of law.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, he was a man of sense and delicacy in his way,\r\nand the late circumstances of Jeanie\xc3\xads family, with the cause of her\r\nexpedition to London, were not unknown to him; so that he answered drily,\r\nit was impossible to stop, as he must be early at Carlisle on some\r\nbusiness of the Duke\xc3\xads, and he accordingly bid the postilions get on.\r\n\r\nThe road at that time passed at about a quarter of a mile\xc3\xads distance from\r\nthe eminence, called Haribee or Harabee-brow, which, though it is very\r\nmoderate in size and height, is nevertheless seen from a great distance\r\naround, owing to the flatness of the country through which the Eden\r\nflows. Here many an outlaw, and border-rider of both kingdoms, had\r\nwavered in the wind during the wars, and scarce less hostile truces,\r\nbetween the two countries. Upon Harabee, in latter days, other executions\r\nhad taken place with as little ceremony as compassion; for these frontier\r\nprovinces remained long unsettled, and, even at the time of which we\r\nwrite, were ruder than those in the centre of England.\r\n\r\nThe postilions drove on, wheeling as the Penrith road led them, round the\r\nverge of the rising ground. Yet still the eyes of Mrs. Dolly Dutton,\r\nwhich, with the head and substantial person to which they belonged, were\r\nall turned towards the scene of action, could discern plainly the outline\r\nof the gallows-tree, relieved against the clear sky, the dark shade\r\nformed by the persons of the executioner and the criminal upon the light\r\nrounds of the tall aerial ladder, until one of the objects, launched into\r\nthe air, gave unequivocal signs of mortal agony, though appearing in the\r\ndistance not larger than a spider dependent at the extremity of his\r\ninvisible thread, while the remaining form descended from its elevated\r\nsituation, and regained with all speed an undistinguished place among the\r\ncrowd. This termination of the tragic scene drew forth of course a squall\r\nfrom Mrs. Dutton, and Jeanie, with instinctive curiosity, turned her head\r\nin the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe sight of a female culprit in the act of undergoing the fatal\r\npunishment from which her beloved sister had been so recently rescued,\r\nwas too much, not perhaps for her nerves, but for her mind and feelings.\r\nShe turned her head to the other side of the carriage, with a sensation\r\nof sickness, of loathing, and of fainting. Her female companion\r\noverwhelmed her with questions, with proffers of assistance, with\r\nrequests that the carriage might be stopped--that a doctor might be\r\nfetched--that drops might be gotten--that burnt feathers and asafoetida,\r\nfair water, and hartshorn, might be procured, all at once, and without\r\none instant\xc3\xads delay. Archibald, more calm and considerate, only desired\r\nthe carriage to push forward; and it was not till they had got beyond\r\nsight of the fatal spectacle, that, seeing the deadly paleness of\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads countenance, he stopped the carriage, and jumping out himself,\r\nwent in search of the most obvious and most easily procured of Mrs.\r\nDutton\xc3\xads pharmacopoeia--a draught, namely, of fair water.\r\n\r\nWhile Archibald was absent on this good-natured piece of service, damning\r\nthe ditches which produced nothing but mud, and thinking upon the\r\nthousand bubbling springlets of his own mountains, the attendants on the\r\nexecution began to pass the stationary vehicle in their way back to\r\nCarlisle.\r\n\r\nFrom their half-heard and half-understood words, Jeanie, whose attention\r\nwas involuntarily rivetted by them, as that of children is by ghost\r\nstories, though they know the pain with which they will afterwards\r\nremember them, Jeanie, I say, could discern that the present victim of\r\nthe law had died game, as it is termed by those unfortunates; that is,\r\nsullen, reckless, and impenitent, neither fearing God nor regarding man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sture woife, and a dour,\xe2\x80\x9d said one Cumbrian peasant, as he clattered\r\nby in his wooden brogues, with a noise like the trampling of a\r\ndray-horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone to ho master, with ho\xc3\xads name in her mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said another;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShame the country should be harried wi\xc3\xad Scotch witches and Scotch\r\nbitches this gate--but I say hang and drown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Gaffer Tramp, take awa yealdon, take awa low--hang the witch,\r\nand there will be less scathe amang us; mine owsen hae been reckan this\r\ntowmont.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mine bairns hae been crining too, mon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his neighbour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence wi\xc3\xad your fule tongues, ye churls,\xe2\x80\x9d said an old woman, who\r\nhobbled past them, as they stood talking near the carriage; \xe2\x80\x9cthis was nae\r\nwitch, but a bluidy-fingered thief and murderess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy? was it e\xc3\xaden sae, Dame Hinchup?\xe2\x80\x9d said one in a civil tone, and\r\nstepping out of his place to let the old woman pass along the\r\nfootpath--\xe2\x80\x9cNay, you know best, sure--but at ony rate, we hae but\r\ntint a Scot of her, and that\xc3\xads a thing better lost than found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman passed on without making any answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gaffer Tramp, \xe2\x80\x9cseest thou how one witch will\r\nspeak for t\xc3\xadother--Scots or English, the same to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion shook his head, and replied in the same subdued tone, \xe2\x80\x9cAy,\r\nay, when a Sark-foot wife gets on her broomstick, the dames of Allonby\r\nare ready to mount, just as sure as the by-word gangs o\xc3\xad the hills,--\r\n\r\n                   If Skiddaw hath a cap,\r\n                   Criffel, wots full weel of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Gager Tramp, \xe2\x80\x9cthinkest thou the daughter o\xc3\xad yon hangit\r\nbody isna as rank a witch as ho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kenna clearly,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the folk are speaking o\xc3\xad\r\nswimming her i\xc3\xad the Eden.\xe2\x80\x9d And they passed on their several roads, after\r\nwishing each other good-morning.\r\n\r\nJust as the clowns left the place, and as Mr. Archibald returned with\r\nsome fair water, a crowd of boys and girls, and some of the lower rabble\r\nof more mature age, came up from the place of execution, grouping\r\nthemselves with many a yell of delight around a tall female fantastically\r\ndressed, who was dancing, leaping, and bounding in the midst of them. A\r\nhorrible recollection pressed on Jeanie as she looked on this unfortunate\r\ncreature; and the reminiscence was mutual, for by a sudden exertion of\r\ngreat strength and agility, Madge Wildfire broke out of the noisy circle\r\nof tormentors who surrounded her, and clinging fast to the door of the\r\ncalash, uttered, in a sound betwixt laughter and screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cEh, d\xc3\xadye\r\nken, Jeanie Deans, they hae hangit our mother?\xe2\x80\x9d Then suddenly changing\r\nher tone to that of the most piteous entreaty, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cO gar them let\r\nme gang to cut her down!--let me but cut her down!--she is my mother, if\r\nshe was waur than the deil, and she\xc3\xadll be nae mair kenspeckle than\r\nhalf-hangit Maggie Dickson,* that cried saut mony a day after she had\r\nbeen hangit; her voice was roupit and hoarse, and her neck was a wee\r\nagee, or ye wad hae kend nae odds on her frae ony other saut-wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Note Q. Half-hanged Maggie Dickson.\r\n\r\nMr. Archibald, embarrassed by the madwoman\xc3\xads clinging to the carriage,\r\nand detaining around them her noisy and mischievous attendants, was all\r\nthis while looking out for a constable or beadle, to whom he might commit\r\nthe unfortunate creature. But seeing no such person of authority, he\r\nendeavoured to loosen her hold from the carriage, that they might escape\r\nfrom her by driving on. This, however, could hardly be achieved without\r\nsome degree of violence; Madge held fast, and renewed her frantic\r\nentreaties to be permitted to cut down her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was but a tenpenny\r\ntow lost,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand what was that to a woman\xc3\xads life?\xe2\x80\x9d There came\r\nup, however, a parcel of savage-looking fellows, butchers and graziers\r\nchiefly, among whose cattle there had been of late a very general and\r\nfatal distemper, which their wisdom imputed to witchcraft. They laid\r\nviolent hands on Madge, and tore her from the carriage, exclaiming--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, doest stop folk o\xc3\xad king\xc3\xads high-way? Hast no done mischief enow\r\nalready, wi\xc3\xad thy murders and thy witcherings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jeanie Deans--Jeanie Deans!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the poor maniac, \xe2\x80\x9csave my\r\nmother, and I will take ye to the Interpreter\xc3\xads house again,--and I will\r\nteach ye a\xc3\xad my bonny sangs,--and I will tell ye what came o\xc3\xad the.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nrest of her entreaties were drowned in the shouts of the rabble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSave her, for God\xc3\xads sake!--save her from those people!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Jeanie\r\nto Archibald.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is mad, but quite innocent; she is mad, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Archibald;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo not use her ill, take her before the Mayor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, we\xc3\xadse hae care enow on her,\xe2\x80\x9d answered one of the fellows; \xe2\x80\x9cgang\r\nthou thy gate, man, and mind thine own matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xads a Scot by his tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said another; \xe2\x80\x9cand an he will come out o\xc3\xad\r\nhis whirligig there, I\xc3\xadse gie him his tartan plaid fu\xc3\xad o\xc3\xad broken banes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was clear nothing could be done to rescue Madge; and Archibald, who\r\nwas a man of humanity, could only bid the postilions hurry on to\r\nCarlisle, that he might obtain some assistance to the unfortunate woman.\r\nAs they drove off, they heard the hoarse roar with which the mob preface\r\nacts of riot or cruelty, yet even above that deep and dire note, they\r\ncould discern the screams of the unfortunate victim. They were soon out\r\nof hearing of the cries, but had no sooner entered the streets of\r\nCarlisle, than Archibald, at Jeanie\xc3\xads earnest and urgent entreaty, went\r\nto a magistrate, to state the cruelty which was likely to be exercised on\r\nthis unhappy creature.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour and a half he returned, and reported to Jeanie, that the\r\nmagistrate had very readily gone in person, with some assistance, to the\r\nrescue of the unfortunate woman, and that he had himself accompanied him;\r\nthat when they came to the muddy pool, in which the mob were ducking her,\r\naccording to their favourite mode of punishment, the magistrate succeeded\r\nin rescuing her from their hands, but in a state of insensibility, owing\r\nto the cruel treatment which she had received. He added, that he had seen\r\nher carried to the workhouse, and understood that she had been brought to\r\nherself, and was expected to do well.\r\n\r\nThis last averment was a slight alteration in point of fact, for Madge\r\nWildfire was not expected to survive the treatment she had received; but\r\nJeanie seemed so much agitated, that Mr. Archibald did not think it\r\nprudent to tell her the worst at once. Indeed, she appeared so fluttered\r\nand disordered by this alarming accident, that, although it had been\r\ntheir intention to proceed to Longtown that evening, her companions\r\njudged it most advisable to pass the night at Carlisle.\r\n\r\nThis was particularly agreeable to Jeanie, who resolved, if possible, to\r\nprocure an interview with Madge Wildfire. Connecting some of her wild\r\nflights with the narrative of George Staunton, she was unwilling to omit\r\nthe opportunity of extracting from her, if possible, some information\r\nconcerning the fate of that unfortunate infant which had cost her sister\r\nso dear. Her acquaintance with the disordered state of poor Madge\xc3\xads mind\r\ndid not permit her to cherish much hope that she could acquire from her\r\nany useful intelligence; but then, since Madge\xc3\xads mother had suffered her\r\ndeserts, and was silent for ever, it was her only chance of obtaining any\r\nkind of information, and she was loath to lose the opportunity.\r\n\r\nShe coloured her wish to Mr. Archibald by saying that she had seen Madge\r\nformerly, and wished to know, as a matter of humanity, how she was\r\nattended to under her present misfortunes. That complaisant person\r\nimmediately went to the workhouse, or hospital, in which he had seen the\r\nsufferer lodged, and brought back for reply, that the medical attendants\r\npositively forbade her seeing any one. When the application for\r\nadmittance was repeated next day, Mr. Archibald was informed that she had\r\nbeen very quiet and composed, insomuch that the clergyman who acted as\r\nchaplain to the establishment thought it expedient to read prayers beside\r\nher bed, but that her wandering fit of mind had returned soon after his\r\ndeparture; however, her countrywoman might see her if she chose it. She\r\nwas not expected to live above an hour or two.\r\n\r\nJeanie had no sooner received this information than she hastened to the\r\nhospital, her companions attending her. They found the dying person in a\r\nlarge ward, where there were ten beds, of which the patient\xc3\xads was the\r\nonly one occupied.\r\n\r\nMadge was singing when they entered--singing her own wild snatches of\r\nsongs and obsolete airs, with a voice no longer overstrained by false\r\nspirits, but softened, saddened, and subdued by bodily exhaustion. She\r\nwas still insane, but was no longer able to express her wandering ideas\r\nin the wild notes of her former state of exalted imagination. There was\r\ndeath in the plaintive tones of her voice, which yet, in this moderated\r\nand melancholy mood, had something of the lulling sound with which a\r\nmother sings her infant asleep. As Jeanie entered she heard first the\r\nair, and then a part of the chorus and words, of what had been, perhaps,\r\nthe song of a jolly harvest-home.\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cOur work is over--over now,\r\n                   The goodman wipes his weary brow,\r\n                  The last long wain wends slow away,\r\n                   And we are free to sport and play.\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cThe night comes on when sets the sun,\r\n                   And labour ends when day is done.\r\n                 When Autumn\xc3\xads gone and Winter\xc3\xads come,\r\n                   We hold our jovial harvest-home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie advanced to the bedside when the strain was finished, and\r\naddressed Madge by her name. But it produced no symptoms of recollection.\r\nOn the contrary, the patient, like one provoked by interruption, changed\r\nher posture, and called out with an impatient tone, \xe2\x80\x9cNurse--nurse, turn\r\nmy face to the wa\xc3\xad, that I may never answer to that name ony mair, and\r\nnever see mair of a wicked world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe attendant on the hospital arranged her in her bed as she desired,\r\nwith her face to the wall and her back to the light. So soon as she was\r\nquiet in this new position, she began again to sing in the same low and\r\nmodulated strains, as if she was recovering the state of abstraction\r\nwhich the interruption of her visitants had disturbed. The strain,\r\nhowever, was different, and rather resembled the music of the Methodist\r\nhymns, though the measure of the song was similar to that of the former:\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the fight of grace is fought--\r\n                  When the marriage vest is wrought--\r\n                  When Faith hath chased cold Doubt away,\r\n                  And Hope but sickens at delay--\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Charity, imprisoned here,\r\n                  Longs for a more expanded sphere,\r\n                     Doff thy robes of sin and clay;\r\n                     Christian, rise, and come away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strain was solemn and affecting, sustained as it was by the pathetic\r\nwarble of a voice which had naturally been a fine one, and which\r\nweakness, if it diminished its power, had improved in softness.\r\nArchibald, though a follower of the court, and a pococurante by\r\nprofession, was confused, if not affected; the dairy-maid blubbered; and\r\nJeanie felt the tears rise spontaneously to her eyes. Even the nurse,\r\naccustomed to all modes in which the spirit can pass, seemed considerably\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nThe patient was evidently growing weaker, as was intimated by an apparent\r\ndifficulty of breathing, which seized her from time to time, and by the\r\nutterance of low listless moans, intimating that nature was succumbing in\r\nthe last conflict. But the spirit of melody, which must originally have\r\nso strongly possessed this unfortunate young woman, seemed, at every\r\ninterval of ease, to triumph over her pain and weakness. And it was\r\nremarkable that there could always be traced in her songs something\r\nappropriate, though perhaps only obliquely or collaterally so, to her\r\npresent situation. Her next seemed the fragment of some old ballad:\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cCauld is my bed, Lord Archibald,\r\n                      And sad my sleep of sorrow;\r\n                  But thine sall be as sad and cauld,\r\n                     My fause true-love! to-morrow.\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cAnd weep ye not, my maidens free,\r\n                 Though death your mistress borrow;\r\n                     For he for whom I die to-day\r\n                     Shall die for me to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she changed the tune to one wilder, less monotonous, and less\r\nregular. But of the words, only a fragment or two could be collected by\r\nthose who listened to this singular scene:\r\n\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cProud Maisie is in the wood,\r\n                           Walking so early;\r\n                     Sweet Robin sits on the bush,\r\n                           Singing so rarely.\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabTell me, thou bonny bird.\r\n                        When shall I marry me?\xc3\xad\r\n                       \xc3\xabWhen six braw gentlemen\r\n                        Kirkward shall carry ye.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabWho makes the bridal bed,\r\n                        Birdie, say truly?\xc3\xad--\r\n                       \xc3\xabThe grey-headed sexton,\r\n                        That delves the grave duly.\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9cThe glow-worm o\xc3\xader grave and stone\r\n                       Shall light thee steady;\r\n                   The owl from the steeple sing,\r\n                       \xc3\xabWelcome, proud lady.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice died away with the last notes, and she fell into a slumber,\r\nfrom which the experienced attendant assured them that she never would\r\nawake at all, or only in the death agony.\r\n\r\nThe nurse\xc3\xads prophecy proved true. The poor maniac parted with existence,\r\nwithout again uttering a sound of any kind. But our travellers did not\r\nwitness this catastrophe. They left the hospital as soon as Jeanie had\r\nsatisfied herself that no elucidation of her sister\xc3\xads misfortunes was to\r\nbe hoped from the dying person.*\r\n\r\n* Note R. Madge Wildfire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.\r\n\r\n                 Wilt thou go on with me?\r\n                 The moon is bright, the sea is calm,\r\n                 And I know well the ocean paths . . .\r\n                       Thou wilt go on with me!\r\n                                          Thalaba.\r\n\r\nThe fatigue and agitation of these various scenes had agitated Jeanie so\r\nmuch, notwithstanding her robust strength of constitution, that Archibald\r\njudged it necessary that she should have a day\xc3\xads repose at the village of\r\nLongtown. It was in vain that Jeanie protested against any delay. The\r\nDuke of Argyle\xc3\xads man of confidence was of course consequential; and as he\r\nhad been bred to the medical profession in his youth (at least he used\r\nthis expression to describe his having, thirty years before, pounded for\r\nsix months in the mortar of old Mungo Mangleman, the surgeon at\r\nGreenock), he was obstinate whenever a matter of health was in question.\r\n\r\nIn this case he discovered febrile symptoms, and having once made a happy\r\napplication of that learned phrase to Jeanie\xc3\xads case, all farther\r\nresistance became in vain; and she was glad to acquiesce, and even to go\r\nto bed, and drink water-gruel, in order that she might possess her soul\r\nin quiet and without interruption.\r\n\r\nMr. Archibald was equally attentive in another particular. He observed\r\nthat the execution of the old woman, and the miserable fate of her\r\ndaughter, seemed to have had a more powerful effect upon Jeanie\xc3\xads mind,\r\nthan the usual feelings of humanity might naturally have been expected to\r\noccasion. Yet she was obviously a strong-minded, sensible young woman,\r\nand in no respect subject to nervous affections; and therefore Archibald,\r\nbeing ignorant of any special connection between his master\xc3\xads prote\xc3\xadge\xc3\xade\r\nand these unfortunate persons, excepting that she had seen Madge formerly\r\nin Scotland, naturally imputed the strong impression these events had\r\nmade upon her, to her associating them with the unhappy circumstances in\r\nwhich her sister had so lately stood. He became anxious, therefore, to\r\nprevent anything occurring which might recall these associations to\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads mind.\r\n\r\nArchibald had speedily an opportunity of exercising this precaution. A\r\npedlar brought to Longtown that evening, amongst other wares, a large\r\nbroad-side sheet, giving an account of the \xe2\x80\x9cLast Speech and Execution of\r\nMargaret Murdockson, and of the barbarous Murder of her Daughter,\r\nMagdalene or Madge Murdockson, called Madge Wildfire; and of her pious\r\nconversation with his Reverence Archdeacon Fleming;\xe2\x80\x9d which authentic\r\npublication had apparently taken place on the day they left Carlisle, and\r\nbeing an article of a nature peculiarly acceptable to such country-folk\r\nas were within hearing of the transaction, the itinerant bibliopolist had\r\nforthwith added them to his stock in trade. He found a merchant sooner\r\nthan he expected; for Archibald, much applauding his own prudence,\r\npurchased the whole lot for two shillings and ninepence; and the pedlar,\r\ndelighted with the profit of such a wholesale transaction, instantly\r\nreturned to Carlisle to supply himself with more.\r\n\r\nThe considerate Mr. Archibald was about to commit his whole purchase to\r\nthe flames, but it was rescued by the yet more considerate dairy-damsel,\r\nwho said, very prudently, it was a pity to waste so much paper, which\r\nmight crepe hair, pin up bonnets, and serve many other useful purposes;\r\nand who promised to put the parcel into her own trunk, and keep it\r\ncarefully out of the sight of Mrs. Jeanie Deans: \xe2\x80\x9cThough, by-the-bye, she\r\nhad no great notion of folk being so very nice. Mrs. Deans might have had\r\nenough to think about the gallows all this time to endure a sight of it,\r\nwithout all this to-do about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArchibald reminded the dame of the dairy of the Duke\xc3\xads particular charge,\r\nthat they should be attentive and civil to Jeanie as also that they were\r\nto part company soon, and consequently would not be doomed to observing\r\nany one\xc3\xads health or temper during the rest of the journey. With which\r\nanswer Mrs. Dolly Dutton was obliged to hold herself satisfied. On the\r\nmorning they resumed their journey, and prosecuted it successfully,\r\ntravelling through Dumfriesshire and part of Lanarkshire, until they\r\narrived at the small town of Rutherglen, within about four miles of\r\nGlasgow. Here an express brought letters to Archibald from the principal\r\nagent of the Duke of Argyle in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing of their contents that evening; but when they were seated\r\nin the carriage the next day, the faithful squire informed Jeanie, that\r\nhe had received directions from the Duke\xc3\xads factor, to whom his Grace had\r\nrecommended him to carry her, if she had no objection, for a stage or two\r\nbeyond Glasgow. Some temporary causes of discontent had occasioned\r\ntumults in that city and the neighbourhood, which would render it\r\nunadvisable for Mrs. Jeanie Deans to travel alone and unprotected betwixt\r\nthat city and Edinburgh; whereas, by going forward a little farther, they\r\nwould meet one of his Grace\xc3\xads subfactors, who was coming down from the\r\nHighlands to Edinburgh with his wife, and under whose charge she might\r\njourney with comfort and in safety.\r\n\r\nJeanie remonstrated against this arrangement. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had been lang,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cfrae hame--her father and her sister behoved to be very anxious to\r\nsee her--there were other friends she had that werena weel in health. She\r\nwas willing to pay for man and horse at Glasgow, and surely naebody wad\r\nmeddle wi\xc3\xad sae harmless and feckless a creature as she was.--She was\r\nmuckle obliged by the offer; but never hunted deer langed for its\r\nresting-place as I do to find myself at Saint Leonard\xc3\xads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe groom of the chambers exchanged a look with his female companion,\r\nwhich seemed so full of meaning, that Jeanie screamed aloud--\xe2\x80\x9cO Mr.\r\nArchibald--Mrs. Dutton, if ye ken of onything that has happened at Saint\r\nLeonard\xc3\xads, for God\xc3\xads sake--for pity\xc3\xads sake, tell me, and dinna keep me in\r\nsuspense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really know nothing, Mrs. Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d said the groom of the chambers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I--I--I am sure, I knows as little,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dame of the dairy,\r\nwhile some communication seemed to tremble on her lips, which, at a\r\nglance of Archibald\xc3\xads eye, she appeared to swallow down, and compressed\r\nher lips thereafter into a state of extreme and vigilant firmness, as if\r\nshe had been afraid of its bolting out before she was aware.\r\n\r\nJeanie saw there was to be something concealed from her, and it was only\r\nthe repeated assurances of Archibald that her father--her sister--all her\r\nfriends were, as far as he knew, well and happy, that at all pacified her\r\nalarm. From such respectable people as those with whom she travelled she\r\ncould apprehend no harm, and yet her distress was so obvious, that\r\nArchibald, as a last resource, pulled out, and put into her hand, a slip\r\nof paper, on which these words were written:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie Deans--You will do me a favour by going with Archibald and my\r\nfemale domestic a day\xc3\xads journey beyond Glasgow, and asking them no\r\nquestions, which will greatly oblige your friend, \xc3\xabArgyle & Greenwich.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough this laconic epistle, from a nobleman to whom she was bound by\r\nsuch inestimable obligations, silenced all Jeanie\xc3\xads objections to the\r\nproposed route, it rather added to than diminished the eagerness of her\r\ncuriosity. The proceeding to Glasgow seemed now no longer to be an object\r\nwith her fellow-travellers. On the contrary, they kept the left-hand side\r\nof the river Clyde, and travelled through a thousand beautiful and\r\nchanging views down the side of that noble stream, till, ceasing to hold\r\nits inland character, it began to assume that of a navigable river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not for gaun intill Glasgow then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, as she observed\r\nthat the drivers made no motion for inclining their horses\xc3\xad heads towards\r\nthe ancient bridge, which was then the only mode of access to St. Mungo\xc3\xads\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Archibald; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is some popular commotion, and as our\r\nDuke is in opposition to the court, perhaps we might be too well\r\nreceived; or they might take it in their heads to remember that the\r\nCaptain of Carrick came down upon them with his Highlandmen in the time\r\nof Shawfield\xc3\xads mob in 1725, and then we would be too ill received.* And,\r\nat any rate, it is best for us, and for me in particular, who may be\r\nsupposed to possess his Grace\xc3\xads mind upon many particulars, to leave the\r\ngood people of the Gorbals to act according to their own imaginations,\r\nwithout either provoking or encouraging them by my presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* In 1725, there was a great riot in Glasgow on account of the malt-tax.\r\nAmong the troops brought in to restore order, was one of the independent\r\ncompanies of Highlanders levied in Argyleshire, and distinguished, in a\r\nlampoon of the period, as \xe2\x80\x9cCampbell of Carrick and his Highland thieves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n It was called Shawfield\xc3\xads Mob, because much of the popular violence was\r\ndirected against Daniel Campbell, Esq. of Shawfield, M. P., Provost of\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nTo reasoning of such tone and consequence Jeanie had nothing to reply,\r\nalthough it seemed to her to contain fully as much self-importance as\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe carriage meantime rolled on; the river expanded itself, and gradually\r\nassumed the dignity of an estuary or arm of the sea. The influence of the\r\nadvancing and retiring tides became more and more evident, and in the\r\nbeautiful words of him of the laurel wreath, the river waxed--\r\n\r\n                 A broader and yet broader stream.\r\n                 The cormorant stands upon its shoals,\r\n                     His black and dripping wings\r\n                     Half open\xc3\xadd to the wind.\r\n            [From Southey\xc3\xads _Thalaba,_ Book xi. stanza 36.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way lies Inverary?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, gazing on the dusky ocean of\r\nHighland hills, which now, piled above each other, and intersected by\r\nmany a lake, stretched away on the opposite side of the river to the\r\nnorthward. \xe2\x80\x9cIs yon high castle the Duke\xc3\xads hoose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, Mrs. Deans?--Lud help thee,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Archibald, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xc3\xads the old\r\ncastle of Dumbarton, the strongest place in Europe, be the other what it\r\nmay. Sir William Wallace was governor of it in the old war with the\r\nEnglish, and his Grace is governor just now. It is always entrusted to\r\nthe best man in Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does the Duke live on that high rock, then?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, he has his deputy-governor, who commands in his absence; he\r\nlives in the white house you see at the bottom of the rock--His Grace\r\ndoes not reside there himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dairy-woman, upon whose mind the road,\r\nsince they had left Dumfries, had made no very favourable impression,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor if he did, he might go whistle for a dairy-woman, an he were the\r\nonly duke in England. I did not leave my place and my friends to come\r\ndown to see cows starve to death upon hills as they be at that pig-stye\r\nof Elfinfoot, as you call it, Mr. Archibald, or to be perched upon the\r\ntop of a rock, like a squirrel in his cage, hung out of a three pair of\r\nstairs\xc3\xad window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInwardly chuckling that these symptoms of recalcitration had not taken\r\nplace until the fair malcontent was, as he mentally termed it, under his\r\nthumb, Archibald coolly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat the hills were none of his making,\r\nnor did he know how to mend them; but as to lodging, they would soon be\r\nin a house of the Duke\xc3\xads in a very pleasant island called Roseneath,\r\nwhere they went to wait for shipping to take them to Inverary, and would\r\nmeet the company with whom Jeanie was to return to Edinburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn island?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, who, in the course of her various and\r\nadventurous travels, had never quitted terra firma, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I am doubting\r\nwe maun gang in ane of these boats; they look unco sma\xc3\xad, and the waves\r\nare something rough, and\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Archibald,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dutton, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not consent to it; I was never\r\nengaed to leave the country, and I desire you will bid the boys drive\r\nround the other way to the Duke\xc3\xads house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a safe pinnace belonging to his Grace, ma\xc3\xadam, close by,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied Archibald, \xe2\x80\x9cand you need be under no apprehensions whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am under apprehensions,\xe2\x80\x9d said the damsel; \xe2\x80\x9cand I insist upon going\r\nround by land, Mr. Archibald, were it ten miles about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry I cannot oblige you, madam, as Roseneath happens to be an\r\nisland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were ten islands,\xe2\x80\x9d said the incensed dame, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xc3\xads no reason why I\r\nshould be drowned in going over the seas to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo reason why you should be drowned certainly, ma\xc3\xadam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nunmoved groom of the chambers, \xe2\x80\x9cbut an admirable good one why you cannot\r\nproceed to it by land.\xe2\x80\x9d And, fixed his master\xc3\xads mandates to perform, he\r\npointed with his hand, and the drivers, turning off the high-road,\r\nproceeded towards a small hamlet of fishing huts, where a shallop,\r\nsomewhat more gaily decorated than any which they had yet seen, having a\r\nflag which displayed a boar\xc3\xads head, crested with a ducal coronet, waited\r\nwith two or three seamen, and as many Highlanders.\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped, and the men began to unyoke their horses, while Mr.\r\nArchibald gravely superintended the removal of the baggage from the\r\ncarriage to the little vessel. \xe2\x80\x9cHas the Caroline been long arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArchibald to one of the seamen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been here in five days from Liverpool, and she\xc3\xads lying down at\r\nGreenock,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the fellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the horses and carriage go down to Greenock then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Archibald,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand be embarked there for Inverary when I send notice--they may stand in\r\nmy cousin\xc3\xads, Duncan Archibald the stabler\xc3\xads.--Ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope\r\nyou will get yourselves ready; we must not lose the tide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cowslip of Inverary, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may do as you\r\nplease--but I will sit here all night, rather than go into that there\r\npainted egg-shell.--Fellow--fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d (this was addressed to a Highlander\r\nwho was lifting a travelling trunk), \xe2\x80\x9cthat trunk is _mine,_ and that\r\nthere band-box, and that pillion mail, and those seven bundles, and the\r\npaper-bag; and if you venture to touch one of them, it shall be at your\r\nperil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Celt kept his eye fixed on the speaker, then turned his head towards\r\nArchibald, and receiving no countervailing signal, he shouldered the\r\nportmanteau, and without farther notice of the distressed damsel, or\r\npaying any attention to remonstrances, which probably he did not\r\nunderstand, and would certainly have equally disregarded whether he\r\nunderstood them or not, moved off with Mrs. Dutton\xc3\xads wearables, and\r\ndeposited the trunk containing them safely in the boat.\r\n\r\nThe baggage being stowed in safety, Mr. Archibald handed Jeanie out of\r\nthe carriage, and, not without some tremor on her part, she was\r\ntransported through the surf and placed in the boat. He then offered the\r\nsame civility to his fellow-servant, but she was resolute in her refusal\r\nto quit the carriage, in which she now remained in solitary state,\r\nthreatening all concerned or unconcerned with actions for wages and\r\nboard-wages, damages and expenses, and numbering on her fingers the gowns\r\nand other habiliments, from which she seemed in the act of being\r\nseparated for ever. Mr. Archibald did not give himself the trouble of\r\nmaking many remonstrances, which, indeed, seemed only to aggravate the\r\ndamsel\xc3\xads indignation, but spoke two or three words to the Highlanders in\r\nGaelic; and the wily mountaineers, approaching the carriage cautiously,\r\nand without giving the slightest intimation of their intention, at once\r\nseized the recusant so effectually fast that she could neither resist nor\r\nstruggle, and hoisting her on their shoulders in nearly a horizontal\r\nposture, rushed down with her to the beach, and through the surf, and\r\nwith no other inconvenience than ruffling her garments a little,\r\ndeposited her in the boat; but in a state of surprise, mortification, and\r\nterror, at her sudden transportation, which rendered her absolutely mute\r\nfor two or three minutes. The men jumped in themselves; one tall fellow\r\nremained till he had pushed off the boat, and then tumbled in upon his\r\ncompanions. They took their oars and began to pull from the shore, then\r\nspread their sail, and drove merrily across the firth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou Scotch villain!\xe2\x80\x9d said the infuriated damsel to Archibald, \xe2\x80\x9chow dare\r\nyou use a person like me in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Archibald, with infinite composure, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xc3\xads high time you\r\nshould know you are in the Duke\xc3\xads country, and that there is not one of\r\nthese fellows but would throw you out of the boat as readily as into it,\r\nif such were his Grace\xc3\xads pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the Lord have mercy on me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dutton. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had had any on\r\nmyself, I would never have engaged with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads something of the latest to think of that now, Mrs. Dutton,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArchibald; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I assure you, you will find the Highlands have their\r\npleasures. You will have a dozen of cow-milkers under your own authority\r\nat Inverary, and you may throw any of them into the lake, if you have a\r\nmind, for the Duke\xc3\xads head people are almost as great as himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a strange business, to be sure, Mr. Archibald,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I suppose I must make the best on\xc3\xadt.--Are you sure the boat will not\r\nsink? it leans terribly to one side, in my poor mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Archibald, taking a most important pinch of\r\nsnuff; \xe2\x80\x9cthis same ferry on Clyde knows us very well, or we know it, which\r\nis all the same; no fear of any of our people meeting with any accident.\r\nWe should have crossed from the opposite shore, but for the disturbances\r\nat Glasgow, which made it improper for his Grace\xc3\xads people to pass through\r\nthe city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not afeard, Mrs. Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dairy-vestal, addressing\r\nJeanie, who sat, not in the most comfortable state of mind, by the side\r\nof Archibald, who himself managed the helm.--\xe2\x80\x9care you not afeard of these\r\nwild men with their naked knees, and of this nut-shell of a thing, that\r\nseems bobbing up and down like a skimming-dish in a milk-pail?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--no--madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie with some hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not feared;\r\nfor I hae seen Hielandmen before, though never was sae near them; and for\r\nthe danger of the deep waters, I trust there is a Providence by sea as\r\nwell as by land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Dutton, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a beautiful thing to have learned to\r\nwrite and read, for one can always say such fine words whatever should\r\nbefall them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArchibald, rejoicing in the impression which his vigorous measures had\r\nmade upon the intractable dairymaid, now applied himself, as a sensible\r\nand good-natured man, to secure by fair means the ascendency which he had\r\nobtained by some wholesome violence; and he succeeded so well in\r\nrepresenting to her the idle nature of her fears, and the impossibility\r\nof leaving her upon the beach enthroned in an empty carriage, that the\r\ngood understanding of the party was completely revived ere they landed at\r\nRoseneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEENTH.\r\n\r\n             Did Fortune guide,\r\n                 Or rather Destiny, our bark, to which\r\n             We could appoint no port, to this best place?\r\n                               Fletcher.\r\n\r\nThe islands in the Firth of Clyde, which the daily passage of so many\r\nsmoke-pennoned steamboats now renders so easily accessible, were in our\r\nfathers\xc3\xad times secluded spots, frequented by no travellers, and few\r\nvisitants of any kind. They are of exquisite, yet varied beauty. Arran, a\r\nmountainous region, or Alpine island, abounds with the grandest and most\r\nromantic scenery. Bute is of a softer and more woodland character. The\r\nCumbrays, as if to exhibit a contrast to both, are green, level, and\r\nbare, forming the links of a sort of natural bar which is drawn along the\r\nmouth of the firth, leaving large intervals, however, of ocean.\r\nRoseneath, a smaller isle, lies much higher up the firth, and towards its\r\nwestern shore, near the opening of the lake called the Gare Loch, and not\r\nfar from Loch Long and Loch Scant, or the Holy Loch, which wind from the\r\nmountains of the Western Highlands to join the estuary of the Clyde.\r\n\r\nIn these isles the severe frost winds which tyrannise over the vegetable\r\ncreation during a Scottish spring, are comparatively little felt; nor,\r\nexcepting the gigantic strength of Arran, are they much exposed to the\r\nAtlantic storms, lying landlocked and protected to the westward by the\r\nshores of Ayrshire. Accordingly, the weeping-willow, the weeping-birch,\r\nand other trees of early and pendulous shoots, flourish in these favoured\r\nrecesses in a degree unknown in our eastern districts; and the air is\r\nalso said to possess that mildness which is favourable to consumptive\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque beauty of the island of Roseneath, in particular, had\r\nsuch recommendations, that the Earls and Dukes of Argyle, from an early\r\nperiod, made it their occasional residence, and had their temporary\r\naccommodation in a fishing or hunting-lodge, which succeeding\r\nimprovements have since transformed into a palace. It was in its original\r\nsimplicity when the little bark which we left traversing the firth at the\r\nend of last CHAPTER approached the shores of the isle.\r\n\r\nWhen they touched the landing-place, which was partly shrouded by some\r\nold low but wide-spreading oak-trees, intermixed with hazel-bushes, two\r\nor three figures were seen as if awaiting their arrival. To these Jeanie\r\npaid little attention, so that it was with a shock of surprise almost\r\nelectrical, that, upon being carried by the rowers out of the boat to the\r\nshore, she was received in the arms of her father!\r\n\r\nIt was too wonderful to be believed--too much like a happy dream to have\r\nthe stable feeling of reality--She extricated herself from his close and\r\naffectionate embrace, and held him at arm\xc3\xads length, to satisfy her mind\r\nthat it was no illusion. But the form was indisputable--Douce David Deans\r\nhimself, in his best light-blue Sunday\xc3\xads coat, with broad metal buttons,\r\nand waistcoat and breeches of the same, his strong gramashes or leggins\r\nof thick grey cloth--the very copper buckles--the broad Lowland blue\r\nbonnet, thrown back as he lifted his eyes to Heaven in speechless\r\ngratitude--the grey locks that straggled from beneath it down his\r\nweather-beaten \xe2\x80\x9chaffets\xe2\x80\x9d--the bald and furrowed forehead--the clear blue\r\neye, that, undimmed by years, gleamed bright and pale from under its\r\nshaggy grey pent-house--the features, usually so stern and stoical, now\r\nmelted into the unwonted expression of rapturous joy, affection, and\r\ngratitude--were all those of David Deans; and so happily did they assort\r\ntogether, that, should I ever again see my friends Wilkie or Allan, I\r\nwill try to borrow or steal from them a sketch of this very scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie--my ain Jeanie--my best--my maist dutiful bairn--the Lord of\r\nIsrael be thy father, for I am hardly worthy of thee! Thou hast redeemed\r\nour captivity--brought back the honour of our house--Bless thee, my\r\nbairn, with mercies promised and purchased! But He _has_ blessed thee, in\r\nthe good of which He has made thee the instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words broke from him not without tears, though David was of no\r\nmelting mood. Archibald had, with delicate attention, withdrawn the\r\nspectators from the interview, so that the wood and setting sun alone\r\nwere witnesses of the expansion of their feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Effie?--and Effie, dear father?\xe2\x80\x9d was an eager interjectional\r\nquestion which Jeanie repeatedly threw in among her expressions of joyful\r\nthankfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe will hear--Ye will hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said David hastily, and over and anon\r\nrenewed his grateful acknowledgments to Heaven for sending Jeanie safe\r\ndown from the land of prelatic deadness and schismatic heresy; and had\r\ndelivered her from the dangers of the way, and the lions that were in the\r\npath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Effie?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated her affectionate sister again and again. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd--and\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (fain would she have said Butler, but she modified the direct\r\ninquiry)--\xe2\x80\x9cand Mr. and Mrs. Saddletree--and Dumbiedikes--and a\xc3\xad friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA\xc3\xad weel--a\xc3\xad weel, praise to His name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd--Mr. Butler--he wasna weel when I gaed awa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is quite mended--quite weel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God--but O, dear father, Effie?--Effie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never see her mair, my bairn,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Deans in a solemn tone--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the ae and only leaf left now on the auld tree--hale be your\r\nportion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is dead!--She is slain!--It has come ower late!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Jeanie,\r\nwringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Deans, in the same grave melancholy tone. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nlives in the flesh, and is at freedom from earthly restraint, if she were\r\nas much alive in faith, and as free from the bonds of Satan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord protect us!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.--\xe2\x80\x9cCan the unhappy bairn hae left you\r\nfor that villain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is ower truly spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Deans--\xe2\x80\x9cShe has left her auld father,\r\nthat has wept and prayed for her--She has left her sister, that travailed\r\nand toiled for her like a mother--She has left the bones of her mother,\r\nand the land of her people, and she is ower the march wi\xc3\xad that son of\r\nBelial--She has made a moonlight flitting of it.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, for a\r\nfeeling betwixt sorrow and strong resentment choked his utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wi\xc3\xad that man?--that fearfu\xc3\xad man?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she has left us\r\nto gang aff wi\xc3\xad him?--O Effie, Effie, wha could hae thought it, after sic\r\na deliverance as you had been gifted wi\xc3\xad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went out from us, my bairn, because she was not of us,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nDavid. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a withered branch will never bear fruit of grace--a\r\nscapegoat gone forth into the wilderness of the world, to carry wi\xc3\xad her,\r\nas I trust, the sins of our little congregation. The peace of the warld\r\ngang wi\xc3\xad her, and a better peace when she has the grace to turn to it! If\r\nshe is of His elected, His ain hour will come. What would her mother have\r\nsaid, that famous and memorable matron, Rebecca MacNaught, whose memory\r\nis like a flower of sweet savour in Newbattle, and a pot of frankincense\r\nin Lugton? But be it sae--let her part--let her gang her gate--let her\r\nbite on her ain bridle--The Lord kens his time--She was the bairn of\r\nprayers, and may not prove an utter castaway. But never, Jeanie, never\r\nmore let her name be spoken between you and me--She hath passed from us\r\nlike the brook which vanisheth when the summer waxeth warm, as patient\r\nJob saith--let her pass, and be forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a melancholy pause which followed these expressions. Jeanie\r\nwould fain have asked more circumstances relating to her sister\xc3\xads\r\ndeparture, but the tone of her father\xc3\xads prohibition was positive. She was\r\nabout to mention her interview with Staunton at his father\xc3\xads rectory;\r\nbut, on hastily running over the particulars in her memory, she thought\r\nthat, on the whole, they were more likely to aggravate than diminish his\r\ndistress of mind. She turned, therefore, the discourse from this painful\r\nsubject, resolving to suspend farther inquiry until she should see\r\nButler, from whom she expected to learn the particulars of her sister\xc3\xads\r\nelopement.\r\n\r\nBut when was she to see Butler? was a question she could not forbear\r\nasking herself, especially while her father, as if eager to escape from\r\nthe subject of his youngest daughter, pointed to the opposite shore of\r\nDumbartonshire, and asking Jeanie \xe2\x80\x9cif it werena a pleasant abode?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n declared to her his intention of removing his earthly tabernacle to that\r\ncountry, \xe2\x80\x9cin respect he was solicited by his Grace the Duke of Argyle, as\r\none well skilled in country labour, and a\xc3\xad that appertained to flocks and\r\nherds, to superintend a store-farm, whilk his Grace had taen into his ain\r\nhand for the improvement of stock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads heart sunk within her at this declaration. \xe2\x80\x9cShe allowed it was a\r\ngoodly and pleasant land, and sloped bonnily to the western sun; and she\r\ndoubtedna that the pasture might be very gude, for the grass looked\r\ngreen, for as drouthy as the weather had been. But it was far frae hame,\r\nand she thought she wad be often thinking on the bonny spots of turf, sae\r\nfu\xc3\xad of gowans and yellow king-cups, amang the Crags at St. Leonard\xc3\xads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinna speak on\xc3\xadt, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish never to hear it\r\nnamed mair--that is, after the rouping is ower, and the bills paid. But I\r\nbrought a\xc3\xad the beasts owerby that I thought ye wad like best. There is\r\nGowans, and there\xc3\xads your ain brockit cow, and the wee hawkit ane, that ye\r\nca\xc3\xadd--I needna tell ye how ye ca\xc3\xadd it--but I couldna bid them sell the\r\npetted creature, though the sight o\xc3\xad it may sometimes gie us a sair\r\nheart--it\xc3\xads no the poor dumb creature\xc3\xads fault--And ane or twa beasts mair\r\nI hae reserved, and I caused them to be driven before the other beasts,\r\nthat men might say, as when the son of Jesse returned from battle, \xc3\xabThis\r\nis David\xc3\xads spoil.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon more particular inquiry, Jeanie found new occasion to admire the\r\nactive beneficence of her friend the Duke of Argyle. While establishing a\r\nsort of experimental farm on the skirts of his immense Highland estates,\r\nhe had been somewhat at a loss to find a proper person in whom to vest\r\nthe charge of it. The conversation his Grace had upon country matters\r\nwith Jeanie Deans during their return from Richmond, had impressed him\r\nwith a belief that the father, whose experience and success she so\r\nfrequently quoted, must be exactly the sort of person whom he wanted.\r\nWhen the condition annexed to Effie\xc3\xads pardon rendered it highly probable\r\nthat David Deans would choose to change his place of residence, this idea\r\nagain occurred to the Duke more strongly, and as he was an enthusiast\r\nequally in agriculture and in benevolence, he imagined he was serving the\r\npurposes of both, when he wrote to the gentleman in Edinburgh entrusted\r\nwith his affairs, to inquire into the character of David Deans,\r\ncowfeeder, and so forth, at St. Leonard\xc3\xads Crags; and if he found him such\r\nas he had been represented, to engage him without delay, and on the most\r\nliberal terms, to superintend his fancy-farm in Dumbartonshire.\r\n\r\nThe proposal was made to old David by the gentleman so commissioned, on\r\nthe second day after his daughter\xc3\xads pardon had reached Edinburgh. His\r\nresolution to leave St. Leonard\xc3\xads had been already formed; the honour of\r\nan express invitation from the Duke of Argyle to superintend a department\r\nwhere so much skill and diligence was required, was in itself extremely\r\nflattering; and the more so, because honest David, who was not without an\r\nexeellent opinion of his own talents, persuaded himself that, by\r\naccepting this charge, he would in some sort repay the great favour he\r\nhad received at the hands of the Argyle family. The appointments,\r\nincluding the right of sufficient grazing for a small stock of his own,\r\nwere amply liberal; and David\xc3\xads keen eye saw that the situation was\r\nconvenient for trafficking to advantage in Highland cattle. There was\r\nrisk of \xe2\x80\x9cher\xc3\xadship\xe2\x80\x9d * from the neighbouring mountains, indeed, but the\r\nawful name of the Duke of Argyle would be a great security, and a trifle\r\nof _black-mail_ would, David was aware, assure his safety.\r\n\r\n* Her\xc3\xadship, a Scottish word which may be said to be now obsolete;\r\nbecause, fortunately, the practice of \xe2\x80\x9cplundering by armed force,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nis its meaning, does not require to be commonly spoken of.\r\n\r\nStill however, there were two points on which he haggled. The first was\r\nthe character of the clergyman with whose worship he was to join; and on\r\nthis delicate point he received, as we will presently show the reader,\r\nperfect satisfaction. The next obstacle was the condition of his youngest\r\ndaughter, obliged as she was to leave Scotland for so many years.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman of the law smiled, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no occasion to\r\ninterpret that clause very strictly--that if the young woman left\r\nScotland for a few months, or even weeks, and came to her father\xc3\xads new\r\nresidence by sea from the western side of England, nobody would know of\r\nher arrival, or at least nobody who had either the right or inclination\r\nto give her disturbance. The extensive heritable jurisdictions of his\r\nGrace excluded the interference of other magistrates with those living on\r\nhis estates, and they who were in immediate dependence on him would\r\nreceive orders to give the young woman no disturbance. Living on the\r\nverge of the Highlands, she might, indeed, be said to be out of Scotland,\r\nthat is, beyond the bounds of ordinary law and civilisation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Deans was not quite satisfied with this reasoning; but the elopement\r\nof Effie, which took place on the third night after her liberation,\r\nrendered his residence at St. Leonard\xc3\xads so detestable to him, that he\r\nclosed at once with the proposal which had been made him, and entered\r\nwith pleasure into the idea of surprising Jeanie, as had been proposed by\r\nthe Duke, to render the change of residence more striking to her. The\r\nDuke had apprised Archibald of these circumstances, with orders to act\r\naccording to the instructions he should receive from Edinburgh, and by\r\nwhich accordingly he was directed to bring Jeanie to Roseneath.\r\n\r\nThe father and daughter communicated these matters to each other, now\r\nstopping, now walking slowly towards the Lodge, which showed itself among\r\nthe trees, at about half-a-mile\xc3\xads distance from the little bay in which\r\nthey had landed. As they approached the house, David Deans informed his\r\ndaughter, with somewhat like a grim smile, which was the utmost advance\r\nhe ever made towards a mirthful expression of visage, that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was\r\nbaith a worshipful gentleman, and ane reverend gentleman, residing\r\ntherein. The worshipful gentleman was his honour the Laird of\r\nKnocktarlitie, who was bailie of the lordship under the Duke of Argyle,\r\nane Highland gentleman, tarr\xc3\xadd wi\xc3\xad the same stick,\xe2\x80\x9d David doubted, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nmony of them, namely, a hasty and choleric temper, and a neglect of the\r\nhigher things that belong to salvation, and also a gripping unto the\r\nthings of this world, without muckle distinction of property; but,\r\nhowever, ane gude hospitable gentleman, with whom it would be a part of\r\nwisdom to live on a gude understanding (for Hielandmen were hasty, ower\r\nhasty). As for the reverend person of whom he had spoken, he was\r\ncandidate by favour of the Duke of Argyle (for David would not for the\r\nuniverse have called him presentee) for the kirk of the parish in which\r\ntheir farm was situated, and he was likely to be highly acceptable unto\r\nthe Christian souls of the parish, who were hungering for spiritual\r\nmanna, having been fed but upon sour Hieland sowens by Mr. Duncan\r\nMacDonought, the last minister, who began the morning duly, Sunday and\r\nSaturday, with a mutchkin of usquebaugh. But I need say the less about\r\nthe present lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, again grimly grimacing, \xe2\x80\x9cas I think ye may\r\nhae seen him afore; and here he is come to meet us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had indeed seen him before, for it was no other than Reuben Butler\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEENTH.\r\n\r\n             No more shalt thou behold thy sister\xc3\xads face;\r\n             Thou hast already had her last embrace.\r\n                           Elegy on Mrs. Anne Killigrew.\r\n\r\nThis second surprise had been accomplished for Jeanie Deans by the rod of\r\nthe same benevolent enchanter, whose power had transplanted her father\r\nfrom the Crags of St. Leonard\xc3\xads to the banks of the Gare Loch. The Duke\r\nof Argyle was not a person to forget the hereditary debt of gratitude,\r\nwhich had been bequeathed to him by his grandfather, in favour of the\r\ngrandson of old Bible Butler. He had internally resolved to provide for\r\nReuben Butler in this kirk of Knocktarlitie, of which the incumbent had\r\njust departed this life. Accordingly, his agent received the necessary\r\ninstructions for that purpose, under the qualifying condition always,\r\nthat the learning and character of Mr. Butler should be found proper for\r\nthe charge. Upon inquiry, these were found as highly satisfactory as had\r\nbeen reported in the case of David Deans himself.\r\n\r\nBy this preferment, the Duke of Argyle more essentially benefited his\r\nfriend and _protegee_, Jeanie, than he himself was aware of, since he\r\ncontributed to remove objections in her father\xc3\xads mind to the match, which\r\nhe had no idea had been in existence.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed that Deans had something of a prejudice against\r\nButler, which was, perhaps, in some degree owing to his possessing a sort\r\nof consciousness that the poor usher looked with eyes of affection upon\r\nhis eldest daughter. This, in David\xc3\xads eyes, was a sin of presumption,\r\neven although it should not be followed by any overt act, or actual\r\nproposal. But the lively interest which Butler had displayed in his\r\ndistresses, since Jeanie set forth on her London expedition, and which,\r\ntherefore, he ascribed to personal respect for himself individually, had\r\ngreatly softened the feelings of irritability with which David had\r\nsometimes regarded him. And, while he was in this good disposition\r\ntowards Butler, another incident took place which had great influence on\r\nthe old man\xc3\xads mind. So soon as the shock of Effie\xc3\xads second elopement was\r\nover, it was Deans\xc3\xads early care to collect and refund to the Laird of\r\nDumbiedikes the money which he had lent for Effie\xc3\xads trial, and for\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads travelling expenses. The Laird, the pony, the cocked hat, and\r\nthe tabacco-pipe, had not been seen at St. Leonard\xc3\xads Crags for many a\r\nday; so that, in order to pay this debt, David was under the necessity of\r\nrepairing in person to the mansion of Dumbiedikes.\r\n\r\nHe found it in a state of unexpected bustle. There were workmen pulling\r\ndown some of the old hangings, and replacing them with others, altering,\r\nrepairing, scrubbing, painting, and white-washing. There was no knowing\r\nthe old house, which had been so long the mansion of sloth and silence.\r\nThe Laird himself seemed in some confusion, and his reception, though\r\nkind, lacked something of the reverential cordiality, with which he used\r\nto greet David Deans. There was a change also, David did not very well\r\nknow of what nature, about the exterior of this landed proprietor--an\r\nimprovement in the shape of his garments, a spruceness in the air with\r\nwhich they were put on, that were both novelties. Even the old hat looked\r\nsmarter; the cock had been newly pointed, the lace had been refreshed,\r\nand instead of slouching backward or forward on the Laird\xc3\xads head, as it\r\nhappened to be thrown on, it was adjusted with a knowing inclination over\r\none eye.\r\n\r\nDavid Deans opened his business, and told down the cash. Dumbiedikes\r\nsteadily inclined his ear to the one, and counted the other with great\r\naccuracy, interrupting David, while he was talking of the redemption of\r\nthe captivity of Judah, to ask him whether he did not think one or two of\r\nthe guineas looked rather light. When he was satisfied on this point, had\r\npocketed his money, and had signed a receipt, he addressed David with\r\nsome little hesitation,--\xe2\x80\x9cJeanie wad be writing ye something, gudeman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the siller?\xe2\x80\x9d replied David--\xe2\x80\x9cNae doubt, she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did she say nae mair about me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Laird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae mair but kind and Christian wishes--what suld she hae said?\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nDavid, fully expecting that the Laird\xc3\xads long courtship (if his dangling\r\nafter Jeanie deserves so active a name) was now coming to a point. And so\r\nindeed it was, but not to that point which he wished or expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, she kens her ain mind best, gudeman. I hae made a clean house o\xc3\xad\r\nJenny Balchristie, and her niece. They were a bad pack--steal\xc3\xadd meat and\r\nmault, and loot the carters magg the coals--I\xc3\xadm to be married the morn,\r\nand kirkit on Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever David felt, he was too proud and too steady-minded to show any\r\nunpleasant surprise in his countenance and manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wuss ye happy, sir, through Him that gies happiness--marriage is an\r\nhonourable state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am wedding into an honourable house, David--the Laird of\r\nLickpelf\xc3\xads youngest daughter--she sits next us in the kirk, and that\xc3\xads\r\nthe way I came to think on\xc3\xadt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no more to be said but again to wish the Laird joy, to taste a\r\ncup of his liquor, and to walk back again to St. Leonard\xc3\xads, musing on the\r\nmutability of human affairs and human resolutions. The expectation that\r\none day or other Jeanie would be Lady Dumbiedikes, had, in spite of\r\nhimself, kept a more absolute possession of David\xc3\xads mind than he himself\r\nwas aware of. At least, it had hitherto seemed a union at all times\r\nwithin his daughter\xc3\xads reach, whenever she might choose to give her silent\r\nlover any degree of encouragement, and now it was vanished for ever.\r\nDavid returned, therefore, in no very gracious humour for so good a man.\r\nHe was angry with Jeanie for not having encouraged the Laird--he was\r\nangry with the Laird for requiring encouragement--and he was angry with\r\nhimself for being angry at all on the occasion.\r\n\r\nOn his return he found the gentleman who managed the Duke of Argyle\xc3\xads\r\naffairs was desirous of seeing him, with a view to completing the\r\narrangement between them. Thus, after a brief repose, he was obliged to\r\nset off anew for Edinburgh, so that old May Hettly declared, \xe2\x80\x9cThat a\xc3\xad\r\nthis was to end with the master just walking himself aff his feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the business respecting the farm had been talked over and arranged,\r\nthe professional gentleman acquainted David Deans, in answer to his\r\ninquiries concerning the state of public worship, that it was the\r\npleasure of the Duke to put an excellent young clergyman, called Reuben\r\nButler, into the parish, which was to be his future residence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReuben Butler!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed David--\xe2\x80\x9cReuben Butler, the usher at Liberton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very same,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke\xc3\xads commissioner; \xe2\x80\x9chis Grace has heard an\r\nexcellent character of him, and has some hereditary obligations to him\r\nbesides--few ministers will be so comfortable as I am directed to make\r\nMr. Butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObligations?--The Duke?--Obligations to Reuben Butler--Reuben Butler a\r\nplaced minister of the Kirk of Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed David, in\r\ninterminable astonishment, for somehow he had been led by the bad success\r\nwhich Butler had hitherto met with in all his undertakings, to consider\r\nhim as one of those step-sons of Fortune, whom she treats with unceasing\r\nrigour, and ends with disinheriting altogether.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no time at which we are disposed to think so highly of\r\na friend, as when we find him standing higher than we expected in the\r\nesteem of others. When assured of the reality of Butler\xc3\xads change of\r\nprospects, David expressed his great satisfaction at his success in life,\r\nwhich, he observed, was entirely owing to himself (David). \xe2\x80\x9cI advised his\r\npuir grand-mother, who was but a silly woman, to breed him up to the\r\nministry; and I prophesied that, with a blessing on his endeavours, he\r\nwould become a polished shaft in the temple. He may be something ower\r\nproud o\xc3\xad his carnal learning, but a gude lad, and has the root of the\r\nmatter--as ministers gang now, where yell find ane better, ye\xc3\xadll find ten\r\nwaur, than Reuben Butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took leave of the man of business, and walked homeward, forgetting his\r\nweariness in the various speculations to which this wonderful piece of\r\nintelligence gave rise. Honest David had now, like other great men, to go\r\nto work to reconcile his speculative principles with existing\r\ncircumstances; and, like other great men, when they set seriously about\r\nthat task, he was tolerably successful.\r\n\r\nOught Reuben Butler in conscience to accept of this preferment in the\r\nKirk of Scotland, subject as David at present thought that establishment\r\nwas to the Erastian encroachments of the civil power? This was the\r\nleading question, and he considered it carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kirk of Scotland\r\nwas shorn of its beams, and deprived of its full artillery and banners of\r\nauthority; but still it contained zealous and fructifying pastors,\r\nattentive congregations, and, with all her spots and blemishes, the like\r\nof this Kirk was nowhere else to be seen upon earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid\xc3\xads doubts had been too many and too critical to permit him ever\r\nunequivocally to unite himself with any of the dissenters, who upon\r\nvarious accounts absolutely seceded from the national church. He had\r\noften joined in communion with such of the established clergy as\r\napproached nearest to the old Presbyterian model and principles of 1640.\r\nAnd although there were many things to be amended in that system, yet he\r\nremembered that he, David Deans, had himself ever been an humble pleader\r\nfor the good old cause in a legal way, but without rushing into\r\nright-hand excesses, divisions and separations. But, as an enemy to\r\nseparation, he might join the right-hand of fellowship with a minister of\r\nthe Kirk of Scotland in its present model. _Ergo,_ Reuben Butler might\r\ntake possession of the parish of Knocktarlitie, without forfeiting his\r\nfriendship or favour--Q. E. D. But, secondly, came the trying point of\r\nlay-patronage, which David Deans had ever maintained to be a coming in by\r\nthe window, and over the wall, a cheating and starving the souls of a\r\nwhole parish, for the purpose of clothing the back and filling the belly\r\nof the incumbent.\r\n\r\nThis presentation, therefore, from the Duke of Argyle, whatever was the\r\nworth and high character of that nobleman, was a limb of the brazen\r\nimage, a portion of the evil thing, and with no kind of consistency could\r\nDavid bend his mind to favour such a transaction. But if the parishioners\r\nthemselves joined in a general call to Reuben Butler to be their pastor,\r\nit did not seem quite so evident that the existence of this unhappy\r\npresentation was a reason for his refusing them the comforts of his\r\ndoctrine. If the Presbytery admitted him to the kirk, in virtue rather of\r\nthat act of patronage than of the general call of the congregation, that\r\nmight be their error, and David allowed it was a heavy one. But if Reuben\r\nButler accepted of the cure as tendered to him by those whom he was\r\ncalled to teach, and who had expressed themselves desirous to learn,\r\nDavid, after considering and reconsidering the matter, came, through the\r\ngreat virtue of if, to be of opinion that he might safely so act in that\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThere remained a third stumbling-block--the oaths to Government exacted\r\nfrom the established clergymen, in which they acknowledge an Erastian\r\nking and parliament, and homologate the incorporating Union between\r\nEngland and Scotland, through which the latter kingdom had become part\r\nand portion of the former, wherein Prelacy, the sister of Popery, had\r\nmade fast her throne, and elevated the horns of her mitre. These were\r\nsymptoms of defection which had often made David cry out, \xe2\x80\x9cMy bowels--my\r\nbowels!--I am pained at the very heart!\xe2\x80\x9d And he remembered that a godly\r\nBow-head matron had been carried out of the Tolbooth church in a swoon,\r\nbeyond the reach of brandy and burnt feathers, merely on hearing these\r\nfearful words, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enacted by the Lords _spiritual_ and temporal,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n pronounced from a Scottish pulpit, in the proem to the Porteous\r\nProclamation. These oaths were, therefore, a deep compliance and dire\r\nabomination--a sin and a snare, and a danger and a defection. But this\r\nshibboleth was not always exacted. Ministers had respect to their own\r\ntender consciences, and those of their brethren; and it was not till a\r\nlater period that the reins of discipline were taken up tight by the\r\nGeneral Assemblies and Presbyteries. The peacemaking particle came again\r\nto David\xc3\xads assistance. _If_ an incumbent was not called upon to make such\r\ncompliances, and _if_ he got a right entry into the church without\r\nintrusion, and by orderly appointment, why, upon the whole, David Deans\r\ncame to be of opinion, that the said incumbent might lawfully enjoy the\r\nspirituality and temporality of the cure of souls at Knocktarlitie, with\r\nstipend, manse, glebe, and all thereunto appertaining.\r\n\r\nThe best and most upright-minded men are so strongly influenced by\r\nexisting circumstances, that it would be somewhat cruel to inquire too\r\nnearly what weight parental affection gave to these ingenious trains of\r\nreasoning. Let David Deans\xc3\xads situation be considered. He was just\r\ndeprived of one daughter, and his eldest, to whom he owed so much, was\r\ncut off, by the sudden resolution of Dumbiedikes, from the high hope\r\nwhich David had entertained, that she might one day be mistress of that\r\nfair lordship. Just while this disappointment was bearing heavy on his\r\nspirits, Butler comes before his imagination--no longer the half-starved\r\nthreadbare usher, but fat and sleek and fair, the beneficed minister of\r\nKnocktarlitie, beloved by his congregation--exemplary in his\r\nlife--powerful in his doctrine--doing the duty of the kirk as never\r\nHighland minister did before--turning sinners as a colley dog turns\r\nsheep--a favourite of the Duke of Argyle, and drawing a stipend of eight\r\nhundred punds Scots, and four chalders of victual. Here was a match,\r\nmaking up in David\xc3\xads mind, in a tenfold degree, the disappointment in\r\nthe case of Dumbiedikes, in so far as the goodman of St. Leonard\xc3\xads held\r\na powerful minister in much greater admiration than a mere landed\r\nproprietor. It did not occur to him, as an additional reason in favour\r\nof the match, that Jeanie might herself have some choice in the matter;\r\nfor the idea of consulting her feelings never once entered into the\r\nhonest man\xc3\xads head, any more than the possibility that her inclination\r\nmight perhaps differ from his own.\r\n\r\nThe result of his meditations was, that he was called upon to take the\r\nmanagement of the whole affair into his own hand, and give, if it should\r\nbe found possible without sinful compliance, or backsliding, or defection\r\nof any kind, a worthy pastor to the kirk of Knocktarlitie. Accordingly,\r\nby the intervention of the honest dealer in butter-milk who dwelt in\r\nLiberton, David summoned to his presence Reuben Butler. Even from this\r\nworthy messenger he was unable to conceal certain swelling emotions of\r\ndignity, insomuch, that, when the carter had communicated his message to\r\nthe usher, he added, that \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly the Gudeman of St. Leonard\xc3\xads had\r\nsome grand news to tell him, for he was as uplifted as a midden-cock upon\r\npattens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler, it may readily be conceived, immediately obeyed the summons. He\r\nwas a plain character, in which worth and good sense and simplicity were\r\nthe principal ingredients; but love, on this occasion, gave him a certain\r\ndegree of address. He had received an intimation of the favour designed\r\nhim by the Duke of Argyle, with what feelings those only can conceive who\r\nhave experienced a sudden prospect of being raised to independence and\r\nrespect from penury and toil. He resolved, however, that the old man\r\nshould retain all the consequence of being, in his own opinion, the first\r\nto communicate the important intelligence. At the same time, he also\r\ndetermined that in the expected conference he would permit David Deans to\r\nexpatiate at length upon the proposal, in all its bearings, without\r\nirritating him either by interruption or contradiction. This last was the\r\nmost prudent plan he could have adopted; because, although there were\r\nmany doubts which David Deans could himself clear up to his own\r\nsatisfaction, yet he might have been by no means disposed to accept the\r\nsolution of any other person; and to engage him in an argument would have\r\nbeen certain to confirm him at once and for ever in the opinion which\r\nButler chanced to impugn.\r\n\r\nHe received his friend with an appearance of important gravity, which\r\nreal misfortune had long compelled him to lay aside, and which belonged\r\nto those days of awful authority in which he predominated over Widow\r\nButler, and dictated the mode of cultivating the crofts of Beersheba. He\r\nmade known to Reuben, with great prolixity, the prospect of his changing\r\nhis present residence for the charge of the Duke of Argyle\xc3\xads stock-farm\r\nin Dumbartonshire, and enumerated the various advantages of the situation\r\nwith obvious self-congratulation; but assured the patient hearer, that\r\nnothing had so much moved him to acceptance, as the sense that, by his\r\nskill in bestial, he could render the most important services to his\r\nGrace the Duke of Argyle, to whom, \xe2\x80\x9cin the late unhappy circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (here a tear dimmed the sparkle of pride in the old man\xc3\xads eye), \xe2\x80\x9che had\r\nbeen sae muckle obliged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo put a rude Hielandman into sic a charge,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat could\r\nbe expected but that he suld be sic a chiefest herdsman, as wicked Doeg\r\nthe Edomite? whereas, while this grey head is to the fore, not a clute o\xc3\xad\r\nthem but sall be as weel cared for as if they were the fatted kine of\r\nPharaoh.--And now, Reuben, lad, seeing we maun remove our tent to a\r\nstrange country, ye will be casting a dolefu\xc3\xad look after us, and thinking\r\nwith whom ye are to hold counsel anent your government in thae slippery\r\nand backsliding times; and nae doubt remembering, that the auld man,\r\nDavid Deans, was made the instrument to bring you out of the mire of\r\nschism and heresy, wherein your father\xc3\xads house delighted to wallow; aften\r\nalso, nae doubt, when ye are pressed wi\xc3\xad ensnaring trials and tentations\r\nand heart-plagues, you, that are like a recruit that is marching for the\r\nfirst time to the touk of drum, will miss the auld, bauld, and\r\nexperienced veteran soldier that has felt the brunt of mony a foul day,\r\nand heard the bullets whistle as aften as he has hairs left on his auld\r\npow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that Butler might internally be of opinion, that the\r\nreflection on his ancestor\xc3\xads peculiar tenets might have been spared, or\r\nthat he might be presumptuous enough even to think, that, at his years,\r\nand with his own lights, he might be able to hold his course without the\r\npilotage of honest David. But he only replied, by expressing his regret,\r\nthat anything should separate him from an ancient, tried, and\r\naffectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can it be helped, man?\xe2\x80\x9d said David, twisting his features into a\r\nsort of smile--\xe2\x80\x9cHow can we help it?--I trow, ye canna tell me that--Ye\r\nmaun leave that to ither folk--to the Duke of Argyle and me, Reuben. It\xc3\xads\r\na gude thing to hae friends in this warld--how muckle better to hae an\r\ninterest beyond it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd David, whose piety, though not always quite rational, was as sincere\r\nas it was habitual and fervent, looked reverentially upward and paused.\r\nMr. Butler intimated the pleasure with which he would receive his\r\nfriend\xc3\xads advice on a subject so important, and David resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat think ye now, Reuben, of a kirk--a regular kirk under the present\r\nestablishment?--Were sic offered to ye, wad ye be free to accept it, and\r\nunder whilk provisions?--I am speaking but by way of query.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat if such a prospect were held out to him, he would\r\nprobably first consult whether he was likely to be useful to the parish\r\nhe should be called to; and if there appeared a fair prospect of his\r\nproving so, his friend must be aware, that in every other point of view,\r\nit would be highly advantageous for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, Reuben, very right, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the monitor, \xe2\x80\x9cyour ain\r\nconscience is the first thing to be satisfied--for how sall he teach\r\nothers that has himself sae ill learned the Scriptures, as to grip for\r\nthe lucre of foul earthly preferment, sic as gear and manse, money and\r\nvictual, that which is not his in a spiritual sense--or wha makes his\r\nkirk a stalking-horse, from behind which he may tak aim at his stipend?\r\nBut I look for better things of you--and specially ye maun be minded not\r\nto act altogether on your ain judgment, for therethrough comes sair\r\nmistakes, backslidings and defections, on the left and on the right. If\r\nthere were sic a day of trial put to you, Reuben, you, who are a young\r\nlad, although it may be ye are gifted wi\xc3\xad the carnal tongues, and those\r\nwhilk were spoken at Rome, whilk is now the seat of the scarlet\r\nabomination, and by the Greeks, to whom the Gospel was as foolishness,\r\nyet nae-the-less ye may be entreated by your weel-wisher to take the\r\ncounsel of those prudent and resolved and weather-withstanding\r\nprofessors, wha hae kend what it was to lurk on banks and in mosses, in\r\nbogs and in caverns, and to risk the peril of the head rather than\r\nrenounce the honesty of the heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat certainly, possessing such a friend as he hoped and\r\ntrusted he had in the goodman himself, who had seen so many changes in\r\nthe preceding century, he should be much to blame if he did not avail\r\nhimself of his experience and friendly counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEneugh said--eneugh said, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Deans, with internal\r\nexultation; \xe2\x80\x9cand say that ye were in the predicament whereof I hae\r\nspoken, of a surety I would deem it my duty to gang to the root o\xc3\xad the\r\nmatter, and lay bare to you the ulcers and imposthumes, and the sores and\r\nthe leprosies, of this our time, crying aloud and sparing not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid Deans was now in his element. He commenced his examination of the\r\ndoctrines and belief of the Christian Church with the very Culdees, from\r\nwhom he passed to John Knox,--from John Knox to the recusants in James\r\nthe Sixth\xc3\xads time--Bruce, Black, Blair, Livingstone,--from them to the\r\nbrief, and at length triumphant period of the Presbyterian Church\xc3\xads\r\nsplendour, until it was overrun by the English Independents. Then\r\nfollowed the dismal times of prelacy, the indulgences, seven in number,\r\nwith all their shades and bearings, until he arrived at the reign of King\r\nJames the Second, in which he himself had been, in his own mind, neither\r\nan obscure actor nor an obscure sufferer. Then was Butler doomed to hear\r\nthe most detailed and annotated edition of what he had so often heard\r\nbefore,--David Deans\xc3\xads confinement, namely, in the iron cage in the\r\nCanongate Tolbooth, and the cause thereof.\r\n\r\nWe should be very unjust to our friend David Deans, if we should\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpretermit\xe2\x80\x9d--to use his own expression--a narrative which he held\r\nessential to his fame. A drunken trooper of the Royal Guards, Francis\r\nGordon by name, had chased five or six of the skulking Whigs, among whom\r\nwas our friend David; and after he had compelled them to stand, and was\r\nin the act of brawling with them, one of their number fired a\r\npocket-pistol, and shot him dead. David used to sneer and shake his head\r\nwhen any one asked him whether _he_ had been the instrument of removing\r\nthis wicked persecutor from the face of the earth. In fact the merit of\r\nthe deed lay between him and his friend, Patrick Walker, the pedlar,\r\nwhose words he was so fond of quoting. Neither of them cared directly to\r\nclaim the merit of silencing Mr. Francis Gordon of the Life-Guards, there\r\nbeing some wild cousins of his about Edinburgh, who might have been even\r\nyet addicted to revenge, but yet neither of them chose to disown or yield\r\nto the other the merit of this active defence of their religious rights.\r\nDavid said, that if he had fired a pistol then, it was what he never did\r\nafter or before. And as for Mr. Patrick Walker, he has left it upon\r\nrecord, that his great surprise was, that so small a pistol could kill so\r\nbig a man. These are the words of that venerable biographer, whose trade\r\nhad not taught him by experience, that an inch was as good as an ell.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe,\xe2\x80\x9d (Francis Gordon) \xe2\x80\x9cgot a shot in his head out of a pocket-pistol,\r\nrather fit for diverting a boy than killing such a furious, mad, brisk\r\nman, which notwithstanding killed him dead!\xe2\x80\x9d*\r\n\r\n* Note S. Death of Francis Gordon.\r\n\r\n Upon the extensive foundation which the history of the kirk afforded,\r\nduring its short-lived triumph and long tribulation, David, with length\r\nof breath and of narrative, which would have astounded any one but a\r\nlover of his daughter, proceeded to lay down his own rules for guiding\r\nthe conscience of his friend, as an aspirant to serve in the ministry.\r\nUpon this subject, the good man went through such a variety of nice and\r\ncasuistical problems, supposed so many extreme cases, made the\r\ndistinctions so critical and nice betwixt the right hand and the left\r\nhand--betwixt compliance and defection--holding back and stepping\r\naside--slipping and stumbling--snares and errors--that at length, after\r\nhaving limited the path of truth to a mathematical line, he was brought\r\nto the broad admission, that each man\xc3\xads conscience, after he had gained\r\na certain view of the difficult navigation which he was to encounter,\r\nwould be the best guide for his pilotage. He stated the examples and\r\narguments for and against the acceptance of a kirk on the present\r\nrevolution model, with much more impartiality to Butler than he had been\r\nable to place them before his own view. And he concluded, that his young\r\nfriend ought to think upon these things, and be guided by the voice of\r\nhis own conscience, whether he could take such an awful trust as the\r\ncharge of souls without doing injury to his own internal conviction of\r\nwhat is right or wrong.\r\n\r\nWhen David had finished his very long harangue, which was only\r\ninterrupted by monosyllables, or little more, on the part of Butler, the\r\norator himself was greatly astonished to find that the conclusion, at\r\nwhich he very naturally wished to arrive, seemed much less decisively\r\nattained than when he had argued the case in his own mind.\r\n\r\nIn this particular, David\xc3\xads current of thinking and speaking only\r\nillustrated the very important and general proposition, concerning the\r\nexcellence of the publicity of debate. For, under the influence of any\r\npartial feeling, it is certain, that most men can more easily reconcile\r\nthemselves to any favourite measure, when agitating it in their own mind,\r\nthan when obliged to expose its merits to a third party, when the\r\nnecessity of seeming impartial procures for the opposite arguments a much\r\nmore fair statement than that which he affords it in tacit meditation.\r\nHaving finished what he had to say, David thought himself obliged to be\r\nmore explicit in point of fact, and to explain that this was no\r\nhypothetical case, but one on which (by his own influence and that of the\r\nDuke of Argyle) Reuben Butler would soon be called to decide.\r\n\r\nIt was even with something like apprehension that David Deans heard\r\nButler announce, in return to this communication, that he would take that\r\nnight to consider on what he had said with such kind intentions, and\r\nreturn him an answer the next morning. The feelings of the father\r\nmastered David on this occasion. He pressed Butler to spend the evening\r\nwith him--He produced, most unusual at his meals, one, nay, two bottles\r\nof aged strong ale.--He spoke of his daughter--of her merits--her\r\nhousewifery--her thrift--her affection. He led Butler so decidedly up to\r\na declaration of his feelings towards Jeanie, that, before nightfall, it\r\nwas distinctly understood she was to be the bride of Reuben Butler; and\r\nif they thought it indelicate to abridge the period of deliberation which\r\nReuben had stipulated, it seemed to be sufficiently understood betwixt\r\nthem, that there was a strong probability of his becoming minister of\r\nKnocktarlitie, providing the congregation were as willing to accept of\r\nhim, as the Duke to grant him the presentation. The matter of the oaths,\r\nthey agreed, it was time enough to dispute about, whenever the shibboleth\r\nshould be tendered.\r\n\r\nMany arrangements were adopted that evening, which were afterwards\r\nripened by correspondence with the Duke of Argyle\xc3\xads man of business, who\r\nintrusted Deans and Butler with the benevolent wish of his principal,\r\nthat they should all meet with Jeanie, on her return from England, at the\r\nDuke\xc3\xads hunting-lodge in Roseneath.\r\n\r\nThis retrospect, so far as the placid loves of Jeanie Deans and Reuben\r\nButler are concerned, forms a full explanation of the preceding narrative\r\nup to their meeting on the island, as already mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTIETH.\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cI come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy love, my life,\r\n                  And--nature\xc3\xads dearest name--my wife:\r\n                  Thy father\xc3\xads house and friends resign,\r\n                  My home, my friends, my sire, are thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                              Logan.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of Jeanie and Butler, under circumstances promising to crown\r\nan affection so long delayed, was rather affecting, from its simple\r\nsincerity than from its uncommon vehemence of feeling. David Deans, whose\r\npractice was sometimes a little different from his theory, appalled them\r\nat first, by giving them the opinion of sundry of the suffering preachers\r\nand champions of his younger days, that marriage, though honourable by\r\nthe laws of Scripture, was yet a state over-rashly coveted by professors,\r\nand specially by young ministers, whose desire, he said, was at whiles\r\ntoo inordinate for kirks, stipends, and wives, which had frequently\r\noccasioned over-ready compliance with the general defections of the\r\ntimes. He endeavoured to make them aware also, that hasty wedlock had\r\nbeen the bane of many a savoury professor--that the unbelieving wife had\r\ntoo often reversed the text and perverted the believing husband--that\r\nwhen the famous Donald Cargill, being then hiding in Lee-Wood, in\r\nLanarkshire, it being killing-time, did, upon importunity, marry Robert\r\nMarshal of Starry Shaw, he had thus expressed himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat hath induced\r\nRobert to marry this woman? her ill will overcome his good--he will not\r\nkeep the way long--his thriving days are done.\xe2\x80\x9d To the sad accomplishment\r\nof which prophecy David said he was himself a living witness, for Robert\r\nMarshal, having fallen into foul compliances with the enemy, went home,\r\nand heard the curates, declined into other steps of defection, and became\r\nlightly esteemed. Indeed, he observed, that the great upholders of the\r\nstandard, Cargill, Peden, Cameron, and Renwick, had less delight in tying\r\nthe bonds of matrimony than in any other piece of their ministerial work;\r\nand although they would neither dissuade the parties, nor refuse their\r\noffice, they considered the being called to it as an evidence of\r\nindifference, on the part of those between whom it was solemnised, to the\r\nmany grievous things of the day. Notwithstanding, however, that marriage\r\nwas a snare unto many, David was of opinion (as, indeed, he had showed in\r\nhis practice) that it was in itself honourable, especially if times were\r\nsuch that honest men could be secure against being shot, hanged, or\r\nbanished, and had ane competent livelihood to maintain themselves, and\r\nthose that might come after them. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d as he concluded\r\nsomething abruptly, addressing Jeanie and Butler, who, with faces as\r\nhigh-coloured as crimson, had been listening to his lengthened argument\r\nfor and against the holy state of matrimony, \xe2\x80\x9cI will leave you to your\r\nain cracks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs their private conversation, however interesting to themselves, might\r\nprobably be very little so to the reader, so far as it respected their\r\npresent feelings and future prospects, we shall pass it over, and only\r\nmention the information which Jeanie received from Butler concerning her\r\nsister\xc3\xads elopement, which contained many particulars that she had been\r\nunable to extract from her father.\r\n\r\nJeanie learned, therefore, that, for three days after her pardon had\r\narrived, Effie had been the inmate of her father\xc3\xads house at St.\r\nLeonard\xc3\xads--that the interviews betwixt David and his erring child, which\r\nhad taken place before she was liberated from prison, had been touching\r\nin the extreme; but Butler could not suppress his opinion, that, when he\r\nwas freed from the apprehension of losing her in a manner so horrible,\r\nher father had tightened the bands of discipline, so as, in some degree,\r\nto gall the feelings, and aggravate the irritability of a spirit\r\nnaturally impatient and petulant, and now doubly so from the sense of\r\nmerited disgrace.\r\n\r\nOn the third night, Effie disappeared from St. Leonard\xc3\xads, leaving no\r\nintimation whatever of the route she had taken. Butler, however, set out\r\nin pursuit of her, and with much trouble traced her towards a little\r\nlanding-place, formed by a small brook which enters the sea betwixt\r\nMusselburgh and Edinburgh. This place, which has been since made into a\r\nsmall harbour, surrounded by many villas and lodging-houses, is now\r\ntermed Portobello. At this time it was surrounded by a waste common,\r\ncovered with furze, and unfrequented, save by fishing-boats, and now and\r\nthen a smuggling lugger. A vessel of this description had been hovering\r\nin the firth at the time of Effie\xc3\xads elopement, and, as Butler\r\nascertained, a boat had come ashore in the evening on which the fugitive\r\nhad disappeared, and had carried on board a female. As the vessel made\r\nsail immediately, and landed no part of their cargo, there seemed little\r\ndoubt that they were accomplices of the notorious Robertson, and that the\r\nvessel had only come into the firth to carry off his paramour.\r\n\r\nThis was made clear by a letter which Butler himself soon afterwards\r\nreceived by post, signed E. D., but without bearing any date of place or\r\ntime. It was miserably ill written and spelt; sea-sickness having\r\napparently aided the derangement of Effie\xc3\xads very irregular orthography\r\nand mode of expression. In this epistle, however, as in all that\r\nunfortunate girl said or did, there was something to praise as well as to\r\nblame. She said in her letter, \xe2\x80\x9cThat she could not endure that her father\r\nand her sister should go into banishment, or be partakers of her\r\nshame,--that if her burden was a heavy one, it was of her own binding,\r\nand she had the more right to bear it alone,--that in future they could\r\nnot be a comfort to her, or she to them, since every look and word of\r\nher father put her in mind of her transgression, and was like to drive\r\nher mad,--that she had nearly lost her judgment during the three days\r\nshe was at St. Leonard\xc3\xads--her father meant weel by her, and all men, but\r\nhe did not know the dreadful pain he gave her in casting up her sins. If\r\nJeanie had been at hame, it might hae dune better--Jeanie was ane, like\r\nthe angels in heaven, that rather weep for sinners, than reckon their\r\ntransgressions. But she should never see Jeanie ony mair, and that was\r\nthe thought that gave her the sairest heart of a\xc3\xad that had come and gane\r\nyet. On her bended knees would she pray for Jeanie night and day, baith\r\nfor what she had done, and what she had scorned to do, in her behalf;\r\nfor what a thought would it have been to her at that moment o\xc3\xad time, if\r\nthat upright creature had made a fault to save her! She desired her\r\nfather would give Jeanie a\xc3\xad the gear--her ain (_i.e._ Effie\xc3\xads) mother\xc3\xads\r\nand a\xc3\xad--She had made a deed, giving up her right, and it was in Mr.\r\nNovit\xc3\xads hand--Warld\xc3\xads gear was henceforward the least of her care, nor\r\nwas it likely to be muckle her mister--She hoped this would make it easy\r\nfor her sister to settle;\xe2\x80\x9d and immediately after this expression, she\r\nwished Butler himself all good things, in return for his kindness to\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cFor herself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe kend her lot would be a waesome ane,\r\nbut it was of her own framing, sae she desired the less pity. But, for\r\nher friends\xc3\xad satisfaction, she wished them to know that she was gaun nae\r\nill gate--that they who had done her maist wrong were now willing to do\r\nher what justice was in their power; and she would, in some warldly\r\nrespects, be far better off than she deserved. But she desired her\r\nfamily to remain satisfied with this assurance, and give themselves no\r\ntrouble in making farther inquiries after her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo David Deans and to Butler this letter gave very little comfort; for\r\nwhat was to be expected from this unfortunate girl\xc3\xads uniting her fate to\r\nthat of a character so notorious as Robertson, who they readily guessed\r\nwas alluded to in the last sentence, excepting that she should become the\r\npartner and victim of his future crimes? Jeanie, who knew George\r\nStaunton\xc3\xads character and real rank, saw her sister\xc3\xads situation under a\r\nray of better hope. She augured well of the haste he had shown to reclaim\r\nhis interest in Effie, and she trusted he had made her his wife. If so,\r\nit seemed improbable that, with his expected fortune, and high\r\nconnections, he should again resume the life of criminal adventure which\r\nhe had led, especially since, as matters stood, his life depended upon\r\nhis keeping his own secret, which could only be done by an entire change\r\nof his habits, and particularly by avoiding all those who had known the\r\nheir of Willingham under the character of the audacious, criminal, and\r\ncondemned Robertson.\r\n\r\nShe thought it most likely that the couple would go abroad for a few\r\nyears, and not return to England until the affair of Porteous was totally\r\nforgotten. Jeanie, therefore, saw more hopes for her sister than Butler\r\nor her father had been able to perceive; but she was not at liberty to\r\nimpart the comfort which she felt in believing that she would be secure\r\nfrom the pressure of poverty, and in little risk of being seduced into\r\nthe paths of guilt. She could not have explained this without making\r\npublic what it was essentially necessary for Effie\xc3\xads chance of comfort to\r\nconceal, the identity, namely, of George Staunton and George Robertson.\r\nAfter all, it was dreadful to think that Effie had united herself to a\r\nman condemned for felony, and liable to trial for murder, whatever might\r\nbe his rank in life, and the degree of his repentance. Besides, it was\r\nmelancholy to reflect, that, she herself being in possession of the whole\r\ndreadful secret, it was most probable he would, out of regard to his own\r\nfeelings, and fear for his safety, never again permit her to see poor\r\nEffie. After perusing and re-perusing her sister\xc3\xads valedictory letter,\r\nshe gave ease to her feelings in a flood of tears, which Butler in vain\r\nendeavoured to check by every soothing attention in his power. She was\r\nobliged, however, at length to look up and wipe her eyes, for her father,\r\nthinking he had allowed the lovers time enough for conference, was now\r\nadvancing towards them from the Lodge, accompanied by the Captain of\r\nKnockdunder, or, as his friends called him for brevity\xc3\xads sake, Duncan\r\nKnock, a title which some youthful exploits had rendered peculiarly\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\nThis Duncan of Knockdunder was a person of first-rate importance in the\r\nisland of Roseneath,* and the continental parishes of Knocktarlitie,\r\nKilmun, and so forth; nay, his influence extended as far as Cowal, where,\r\nhowever, it was obscured by that of another factor.\r\n\r\n* [This is, more correctly speaking, a peninsula.]\r\n\r\nThe Tower of Knockdunder still occupies, with its remains, a cliff\r\noverhanging the Holy Loch. Duncan swore it had been a royal castle; if\r\nso, it was one of the smallest, the space within only forming a square of\r\nsixteen feet, and bearing therefore a ridiculous proportion to the\r\nthickness of the walls, which was ten feet at least. Such as it was,\r\nhowever, it had long given the title of Captain, equivalent to that of\r\nChatellain, to the ancestors of Duncan, who were retainers of the house\r\nof Argyle, and held a hereditary jurisdiction under them, of little\r\nextent indeed, but which had great consequence in their own eyes, and was\r\nusually administered with a vigour somewhat beyond the law.\r\n\r\nThe present representative of that ancient family was a stout short man\r\nabout fifty, whose pleasure it was to unite in his own person the dress\r\nof the Highlands and Lowlands, wearing on his head a black tie-wig,\r\nsurmounted by a fierce cocked-hat, deeply guarded with gold lace, while\r\nthe rest of his dress consisted of the plaid and philabeg. Duncan\r\nsuperintended a district which was partly Highland, partly Lowland, and\r\ntherefore might be supposed to combine their national habits, in order to\r\nshow his impartiality to Trojan or Tyrian. The incongruity, however, had\r\na whimsical and ludicrous effect, as it made his head and body look as if\r\nbelonging to different individuals; or, as some one said who had seen the\r\nexecutions of the insurgent prisoners in 1715, it seemed as if some\r\nJacobite enchanter, having recalled the sufferers to life, had clapped,\r\nin his haste, an Englishman\xc3\xads head on a Highlander\xc3\xads body. To finish the\r\nportrait, the bearing of the gracious Duncan was brief, bluff, and\r\nconsequential, and the upward turn of his short copper-coloured nose\r\nindicated that he was somewhat addicted to wrath and usquebaugh.\r\n\r\nWhen this dignitary had advanced up to Butler and to Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cI take the\r\nfreedom, Mr. Deans,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a very consequential manner, \xe2\x80\x9cto salute\r\nyour daughter, whilk I presume this young lass to be--I kiss every pretty\r\ngirl that comes to Roseneath, in virtue of my office.\xe2\x80\x9d Having made this\r\ngallant speech, he took out his quid, saluted Jeanie with a hearty smack,\r\nand bade her welcome to Argyle\xc3\xads country. Then addressing Butler, he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYe maun gang ower and meet the carle ministers yonder the Morn,\r\nfor they will want to do your job, and synd it down with usquebaugh\r\ndoubtless--they seldom make dry wark in this kintra.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Laird\xe2\x80\x9d--said David Deans, addressing Butler in farther\r\nexplanation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Captain, man,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cfolk winna ken wha ye are\r\nspeaking aboot, unless ye gie shentlemens their proper title.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Captain, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, \xe2\x80\x9cassures me that the call is unanimous\r\non the part of the parishioners--a real harmonious call, Reuben.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pelieve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, \xe2\x80\x9cit was as harmonious as could pe expected,\r\nwhen the tae half o\xc3\xad the bodies were clavering Sassenach, and the t\xc3\xadother\r\nskirting Gaelic, like sea-maws and clackgeese before a storm. Ane wad hae\r\nneeded the gift of tongues to ken preceesely what they said--but I\r\npelieve the best end of it was, \xc3\xabLong live MacCallummore and\r\nKnockdunder!\xc3\xad--And as to its being an unanimous call, I wad be glad to\r\nken fat business the carles have to call ony thing or ony body but what\r\nthe Duke and mysell likes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cif any of the parishioners have any\r\nscruples, which sometimes happen in the mind of sincere professors, I\r\nshould be happy of an opportunity of trying to remove--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fash your peard about it, man,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Duncan Knock--\xe2\x80\x9cLeave\r\nit a\xc3\xad to me.--Scruple! deil ane o\xc3\xad them has been bred up to scruple\r\nonything that they\xc3\xadre bidden to do. And if sic a thing suld happen as ye\r\nspeak o\xc3\xad, ye sall see the sincere professor, as ye ca\xc3\xad him, towed at the\r\nstern of my boat for a few furlongs. I\xc3\xadll try if the water of the Haly\r\nLoch winna wash off scruples as weel as fleas--Cot tam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest of Duncan\xc3\xads threat was lost in a growling gargling sort of\r\nsound, which he made in his throat, and which menaced recusants with no\r\ngentle means of conversion. David Deans would certainly have given battle\r\nin defence of the right of the Christian congregation to be consulted in\r\nthe choice of their own pastor, which, in his estimation, was one of the\r\nchoicest and most inalienable of their privileges; but he had again\r\nengaged in close conversation with Jeanie, and, with more interest than\r\nhe was in use to take in affairs foreign alike to his occupation and to\r\nhis religious tenets, was inquiring into the particulars of her London\r\njourney. This was, perhaps, fortunate for the newformed friendship\r\nbetwixt him and the Captain of Knockdunder, which rested, in David\xc3\xads\r\nestimation, upon the proofs he had given of his skill in managing stock;\r\nbut, in reality, upon the special charge transmitted to Duncan from the\r\nDuke and his agent, to behave with the utmost attention to Deans and his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, in a commanding tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI am to pray ye a\xc3\xad\r\nto come in to your supper, for yonder is Mr. Archibald half famished, and\r\na Saxon woman, that looks as if her een were fleeing out o\xc3\xad her head wi\xc3\xad\r\nfear and wonder, as if she had never seen a shentleman in a philabeg\r\npefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Reuben Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, \xe2\x80\x9cwill doubtless desire instantly to\r\nretire, that he may prepare his mind for the exercise of to-morrow, that\r\nhis work may suit the day, and be an offering of a sweet savour in the\r\nnostrils of the reverend Presbytery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout tout, man, it\xc3\xads but little ye ken about them,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the\r\nCaptain. \xe2\x80\x9cTeil a ane o\xc3\xad them wad gie the savour of the hot venison pasty\r\nwhich I smell\xe2\x80\x9d (turning his squab nose up in the air) \xe2\x80\x9ca\xc3\xad the way frae\r\nthe Lodge, for a\xc3\xad that Mr. Putler, or you either, can say to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid groaned; but judging he had to do with a Gallio, as he said, did\r\nnot think it worth his while to give battle. They followed the Captain to\r\nthe house, and arranged themselves with great ceremony round a\r\nwell-loaded supper-table. The only other circumstance of the evening\r\nworthy to be recorded is, that Butler pronounced the blessing; that\r\nKnockdunder found it too long, and David Deans censured it as too short,\r\nfrom which the charitable reader may conclude it was exactly the proper\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIRST.\r\n\r\n                  Now turn the Psalms of David ower,\r\n                       And lilt wi\xc3\xad holy clangor;\r\n                   Of double verse come gie us four,\r\n                       And skirl up the Bangor.\r\n                                            Burns.\r\n\r\nThe next was the important day, when, according to the forms and ritual\r\nof the Scottish Kirk, Reuben Butler was to be ordained minister of\r\nKnocktarlitie, by the Presbytery of ------. And so eager were the whole\r\nparty, that all, excepting Mrs. Dutton, the destined Cowslip of Inverary,\r\nwere stirring at an early hour.\r\n\r\nTheir host, whose appetite was as quick and keen as his temper, was not\r\nlong in summoning them to a substantial breakfast, where there were at\r\nleast a dozen of different preparations of milk, plenty of cold meat,\r\nscores boiled and roasted eggs, a huge cag of butter, half-a-firkin\r\nherrings boiled and broiled, fresh and salt, and tea and coffee for them\r\nthat liked it, which, as their landlord assured them, with a nod and a\r\nwink, pointing, at the same time, to a little cutter which seemed dodging\r\nunder the lee of the island, cost them little beside the fetching ashore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the contraband trade permitted here so openly?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould think it very unfavourable to the people\xc3\xads morals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke, Mr. Putler, has gien nae orders concerning the putting of it\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate, and seemed to think that he had said all that\r\nwas necessary to justify his connivance. Butler was a man of prudence,\r\nand aware that real good can only be obtained by remonstrance when\r\nremonstrance is well-timed; so for the present he said nothing more on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was half over, in flounced Mrs. Dolly, as fine as a blue\r\nsacque and cherry-coloured ribands could make her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morrow to you, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master of ceremonies; \xe2\x80\x9cI trust your\r\nearly rising will not skaith ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dame apologised to Captain Knockunder, as she was pleased to term\r\ntheir entertainer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, as we say in Cheshire,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI was like\r\nthe Mayor of Altringham, who lies in bed while his breeches are mending,\r\nfor the girl did not bring up the right bundle to my room, till she had\r\nbrought up all the others by mistake one after t\xc3\xadother--Well, I suppose\r\nwe are all for church to-day, as I understand--Pray may I be so bold as\r\nto ask, if it is the fashion for your North country gentlemen to go to\r\nchurch in your petticoats, Captain Knockunder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain of Knockdunder, madam, if you please, for I knock under to no\r\nman; and in respect of my garb, I shall go to church as I am, at your\r\nservice, madam; for if I were to lie in bed like your Major\r\nWhat-d\xc3\xadye-callum, till my preeches were mended, I might be there all my\r\nlife, seeing I never had a pair of them on my person but twice in my\r\nlife, which I am pound to remember, it peing when the Duke brought his\r\nDuchess here, when her Grace pehoved to be pleasured; so I e\xc3\xaden porrowed\r\nthe minister\xc3\xads trews for the twa days his Grace was pleased to stay--but\r\nI will put myself under sic confinement again for no man on earth, or\r\nwoman either, but her Grace being always excepted, as in duty pound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the milking-pail stared but, making no answer to this\r\nround declaration, immediately proceeded to show, that the alarm of the\r\npreceding evening had in no degree injured her appetite.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was finished, the Captain proposed to them to take boat, in\r\norder that Mrs. Jeanie might see her new place of residence, and that he\r\nhimself might inquire whether the necessary preparations had been made\r\nthere, and at the Manse, for receiving the future inmates of these\r\nmansions.\r\n\r\nThe morning was delightful, and the huge mountain-shadows slept upon the\r\nmirrored wave of the firth, almost as little disturbed as if it had been\r\nan inland lake. Even Mrs. Dutton\xc3\xads fears no longer annoyed her. She had\r\nbeen informed by Archibald, that there was to be some sort of junketting\r\nafter the sermon, and that was what she loved dearly; and as for the\r\nwater, it was so still that it would look quite like a pleasuring on the\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nThe whole party being embarked, therefore, in a large boat, which the\r\ncaptain called his coach and six, and attended by a smaller one termed\r\nhis gig, the gallant Duncan steered straight upon the little tower of the\r\nold-fashioned church of Knocktarlitie, and the exertions of six stout\r\nrowers sped them rapidly on their voyage. As they neared the land, the\r\nhills appeared to recede from them, and a little valley, formed by the\r\ndescent of a small river from the mountains, evolved itself as it were\r\nupon their approach. The style of the country on each side was simply\r\npastoral, and resembled, in appearance and character, the description of\r\na forgotten Scottish poet, which runs nearly thus:--\r\n\r\n                  The water gently down a level slid,\r\n               With little din, but couthy what it made;\r\n              On ilka side the trees grew thick and lang,\r\n            And wi\xc3\xad the wild birds\xc3\xad notes were a\xc3\xad in sang;\r\n               On either side, a full bow-shot and mair,\r\n                 The green was even, gowany, and fair;\r\n                With easy slope on every hand the braes\r\n            To the hills\xc3\xad feet with scatter\xc3\xadd bushes raise;\r\n              With goats and sheep aboon, and kye below,\r\n                The bonny banks all in a swarm did go.*\r\n\r\n* Ross\xc3\xads _Fortunate Shepherdess._ Edit. 1778, p. 23.\r\n\r\nThey landed in this Highland Arcadia, at the mouth of the small stream\r\nwhich watered the delightful and peaceable valley. Inhabitants of several\r\ndescriptions came to pay their respects to the Captain of Knockdunder, a\r\nhomage which he was very peremptory in exacting, and to see the new\r\nsettlers. Some of these were men after David Deans\xc3\xads own heart, elders of\r\nthe kirk-session, zealous professors, from the Lennox, Lanarkshire, and\r\nAyrshire, to whom the preceding Duke of Argyle had given _rooms_ in this\r\ncorner of his estate, because they had suffered for joining his father,\r\nthe unfortunate Earl, during his ill-fated attempt in 1686. These were\r\ncakes of the right leaven for David regaling himself with; and, had it\r\nnot been for this circumstance, he has been heard to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\nCaptain of Knockdunder would have swore him out of the country in\r\ntwenty-four hours, sae awsome it was to ony thinking soul to hear his\r\nimprecations, upon the slightest temptation that crossed his humour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBesides these, there were a wilder set of parishioners, mountaineers from\r\nthe upper glen and adjacent hill, who spoke Gaelic, went about armed, and\r\nwore the Highland dress. But the strict commands of the Duke had\r\nestablished such good order in this part of his territories, that the\r\nGael and Saxons lived upon the best possible terms of good neighbourhood.\r\nThey first visited the Manse, as the parsonage is termed in Scotland. It\r\nwas old, but in good repair, and stood snugly embosomed in a grove of\r\nsycamore, with a well-stocked garden in front, bounded by the small\r\nriver, which was partly visible from the windows, partly concealed by the\r\nbushes, trees, and bounding hedge. Within, the house looked less\r\ncomfortable than it might have been, for it had been neglected by the\r\nlate incumbent; but workmen had been labouring, under the directions of\r\nthe Captain of Knockdunder, and at the expense of the Duke of Argyle, to\r\nput it into some order. The old \xe2\x80\x9cplenishing\xe2\x80\x9d had been removed, and neat,\r\nbut plain household furniture had been sent down by the Duke in a brig of\r\nhis own called the Caroline, and was now ready to be placed in order in\r\nthe apartments.\r\n\r\nThe gracious Duncan, finding matters were at a stand among the workmen,\r\nsummoned before him the delinquents, and impressed all who heard him with\r\na sense of his authority, by the penalties with which he threatened them\r\nfor their delay. Mulcting them in half their charge, he assured them,\r\nwould be the least of it; for, if they were to neglect his pleasure and\r\nthe Duke\xc3\xads, \xe2\x80\x9che would be tamn\xc3\xadd if he paid them the t\xc3\xadother half either,\r\nand they might seek law for it where they could get it.\xe2\x80\x9d The work-people\r\nhumbled themselves before the offended dignitary, and spake him soft and\r\nfair; and at length, upon Mr. Butler recalling to his mind that it was\r\nthe ordination-day, and that the workmen were probably thinking of going\r\nto church, Knockdunder agreed to forgive them, out of respect to their\r\nnew minister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut an I catch them neglecking my duty again, Mr. Putler, the teil pe in\r\nme if the kirk shall be an excuse; for what has the like o\xc3\xad them\r\nrapparees to do at the kirk ony day put Sundays, or then either, if the\r\nDuke and I has the necessitous uses for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may be guessed with what feelings of quiet satisfaction and delight\r\nButler looked forward to spending his days, honoured and useful as he\r\ntrusted to be, in this sequestered valley, and how often an intelligent\r\nglance was exchanged betwixt him and Jeanie, whose good-humoured face\r\nlooked positively handsome, from the expression of modesty, and, at the\r\nsame time, of satisfaction, which she wore when visiting the apartments\r\nof which she was soon to call herself mistress. She was left at liberty\r\nto give more open indulgence to her feelings of delight and admiration,\r\nwhen, leaving the Manse, the company proceeded to examine the destined\r\nhabitation of David Deans.\r\n\r\nJeanie found with pleasure that it was not above a musket-shot from the\r\nManse; for it had been a bar to her happiness to think she might be\r\nobliged to reside at a distance from her father, and she was aware that\r\nthere were strong objections to his actually living in the same house\r\nwith Butler. But this brief distance was the very thing which she could\r\nhave wished.\r\n\r\nThe farmhouse was on the plan of an improved cottage, and contrived with\r\ngreat regard to convenience; an excellent little garden, an orchard, and\r\na set of offices complete, according to the best ideas of the time,\r\ncombined to render it a most desirable habitation for the practical\r\nfarmer, and far superior to the hovel at Woodend, and the small house at\r\nSaint Leonard\xc3\xads Crags. The situation was considerably higher than that of\r\nthe Manse, and fronted to the west. The windows commanded an enchanting\r\nview of the little vale over which the mansion seemed to preside, the\r\nwindings of the stream, and the firth, with its associated lakes and\r\nromantic islands. The hills of Dumbartonshire, once possessed by the\r\nfierce clan of MacFarlanes, formed a crescent behind the valley, and far\r\nto the right were seen the dusky and more gigantic mountains of\r\nArgyleshire, with a seaward view of the shattered and thunder-splitten\r\npeaks of Arran.\r\n\r\nBut to Jeanie, whose taste for the picturesque, if she had any by nature,\r\nhad never been awakened or cultivated, the sight of the faithful old May\r\nHettly, as she opened the door to receive them in her clean toy, Sunday\xc3\xads\r\nrusset-gown, and blue apron, nicely smoothed down before her, was worth\r\nthe whole varied landscape. The raptures of the faithful old creature at\r\nseeing Jeanie were equal to her own, as she hastened to assure her, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nbaith the gudeman and the beasts had been as weel seen after as she\r\npossibly could contrive.\xe2\x80\x9d Separating her from the rest of the company,\r\nMay then hurried her young mistress to the offices, that she might\r\nreceive the compliments she expected for her care of the cows. Jeanie\r\nrejoiced, in the simplicity of her heart, to see her charge once more;\r\nand the mute favourites of our heroine, Gowans, and the others,\r\nacknowledged her presence by lowing, turning round their broad and decent\r\nbrows when they heard her well-known \xe2\x80\x9cPruh, my leddy--pruh, my woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and, by various indications, known only to those who have studied the\r\nhabits of the milky mothers, showing sensible pleasure as she approached\r\nto caress them in their turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very brute beasts are glad to see ye again,\xe2\x80\x9d said May; \xe2\x80\x9cbut nae\r\nwonder, Jeanie, for ye were aye kind to beast and body. And I maun learn\r\nto ca\xc3\xad ye _mistress_ now, Jeanie, since ye hae been up to Lunnon, and\r\nseen the Duke, and the King, and a\xc3\xad the braw folk. But wha kens,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nthe old dame slily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I\xc3\xadll hae to ca\xc3\xad ye forby mistress, for I am\r\nthinking it wunna lang be Deans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCa\xc3\xad me your ain Jeanie, May, and then ye can never gang wrang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the cow-house which they examined, there was one animal which Jeanie\r\nlooked at till the tears gushed from her eyes. May, who had watched her\r\nwith a sympathising expression, immediately observed, in an under-tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gudeman aye sorts that beast himself, and is kinder to it than ony\r\nbeast in the byre; and I noticed he was that way e\xc3\xaden when he was\r\nangriest, and had maist cause to be angry.--Eh, sirs! a parent\xc3\xads heart\xc3\xads\r\na queer thing!--Mony a warsle he has had for that puir lassie--I am\r\nthinking he petitions mair for her than for yoursell, hinny; for what can\r\nhe plead for you but just to wish you the blessing ye deserve? And when I\r\nsleepit ayont the hallan, when we came first here, he was often earnest\r\na\xc3\xad night, and I could hear him come ower and ower again wi\xc3\xad, \xc3\xabEffie--puir\r\nblinded misguided thing!\xc3\xad it was aye \xc3\xabEffie! Effie!\xc3\xad--If that puir\r\nwandering lamb comena into the sheepfauld in the Shepherd\xc3\xads ain time, it\r\nwill be an unco wonder, for I wot she has been a child of prayers. Oh, if\r\nthe puir prodigal wad return, sae blithely as the goodman wad kill the\r\nfatted calf!--though Brockie\xc3\xads calf will no be fit for killing this three\r\nweeks yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, with the discursive talent of persons of her description, she\r\ngot once more afloat in her account of domestic affairs, and left this\r\ndelicate and affecting topic.\r\n\r\nHaving looked at every thing in the offices and the dairy, and expressed\r\nher satisfaction with the manner in which matters had been managed in her\r\nabsence, Jeanie rejoined the rest of the party, who were surveying the\r\ninterior of the house, all excepting David Deans and Butler, who had gone\r\ndown to the church to meet the kirk-session and the clergymen of the\r\nPresbytery, and arrange matters for the duty of the day.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the cottage all was clean, neat, and suitable to the\r\nexterior. It had been originally built and furnished by the Duke, as a\r\nretreat for a favourite domestic of the higher class, who did not long\r\nenjoy it, and had been dead only a few months, so that every thing was in\r\nexcellent taste and good order. But in Jeanie\xc3\xads bedroom was a neat trunk,\r\nwhich had greatly excited Mrs. Dutton\xc3\xads curiosity, for she was sure that\r\nthe direction, \xe2\x80\x9cFor Mrs. Jean Deans, at Auchingower, parish of\r\nKnocktarlitie,\xe2\x80\x9d was the writing of Mrs. Semple, the Duchess\xc3\xads own woman.\r\nMay Hettly produced the key in a sealed parcel, which bore the same\r\naddress, and attached to the key was a label, intimating that the trunk\r\nand its contents were \xe2\x80\x9ca token of remembrance to Jeanie Deans, from her\r\nfriends the Duchess of Argyle and the young ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d The trunk, hastily\r\nopened, as the reader will not doubt, was found to be full of wearing\r\napparel of the best quality, suited to Jeanie\xc3\xads rank in life; and to most\r\nof the articles the names of the particular donors were attached, as if\r\nto make Jeanie sensible not only of the general, but of the individual\r\ninterest she had excited in the noble family. To name the various\r\narticles by their appropriate names, would be to attempt things\r\nunattempted yet in prose or rhyme; besides that the old-fashioned terms\r\nof manteaus, sacques, kissing-strings, and so forth, would convey but\r\nlittle information even to the milliners of the present day. I shall\r\ndeposit, however, an accurate inventory of the contents of the trunk with\r\nmy kind friend, Miss Martha Buskbody, who has promised, should the public\r\ncuriosity seem interested in the subject, to supply me with a\r\nprofessional glossary and commentary. Suffice it to say, that the gift\r\nwas such as became the donors, and was suited to the situation of the\r\nreceiver; that every thing was handsome and appropriate, and nothing\r\nforgotten which belonged to the wardrobe of a young person in Jeanie\xc3\xads\r\nsituation in life, the destined bride of a respectable clergyman.\r\n\r\nArticle after article was displayed, commented upon, and admired, to the\r\nwonder of May, who declared, \xe2\x80\x9cshe didna think the queen had mair or\r\nbetter claise,\xe2\x80\x9d and somewhat to the envy of the northern Cowslip. This\r\nunamiable, but not very unnatural, disposition of mind, broke forth in\r\nsundry unfounded criticisms to the disparagement of the articles, as they\r\nwere severally exhibited. But it assumed a more direct character, when,\r\nat the bottom of all, was found a dress of white silk, very plainly made,\r\nbut still of white silk, and French silk to boot, with a paper pinned to\r\nit, bearing that it was a present from the Duke of Argyle to his\r\ntravelling companion, to be worn on the day when she should change her\r\nname.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dutton could forbear no longer, but whispered into Mr. Archibald\xc3\xads\r\near, that it was a clever thing to be a Scotchwoman: \xe2\x80\x9cShe supposed all\r\n_her_ sisters, and she had half-a-dozen, might have been hanged, without\r\nany one sending her a present of a pocket handkerchief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr without your making any exertion to save them, Mrs. Dolly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nArchibald drily.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am surprised we do not hear the bell yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFat ta deil, Mr. Archibald,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Captain of Knockdunder, \xe2\x80\x9cwad\r\nye hae them ring the bell before I am ready to gang to kirk?--I wad gar\r\nthe bedral eat the bell-rope, if he took ony sic freedom. But if ye want\r\nto hear the bell, I will just show mysell on the knowe-head, and it will\r\nbegin jowing forthwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, so soon as they sallied out, and that the gold-laced hat of\r\nthe Captain was seen rising like Hesper above the dewy verge of the\r\nrising ground, the clash (for it was rather a clash than a clang) of the\r\nbell was heard from the old moss-grown tower, and the clapper continued\r\nto thump its cracked sides all the while they advanced towards the kirk,\r\nDuncan exhorting them to take their own time, \xe2\x80\x9cfor teil ony sport wad be\r\ntill he came.\xe2\x80\x9d *\r\n\r\n* Note T. Tolling to service in Scotland.\r\n\r\n Accordingly, the bell only changed to the final and impatient chime when\r\nthey crossed the stile; and \xe2\x80\x9crang in,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, concluded its mistuned\r\nsummons, when they had entered the Duke\xc3\xads seat, in the little kirk, where\r\nthe whole party arranged themselves, with Duncan at their head, excepting\r\nDavid Deans, who already occupied a seat among the elders.\r\n\r\nThe business of the day, with a particular detail of which it is\r\nunnecessary to trouble the reader, was gone through according to the\r\nestablished form, and the sermon pronounced upon the occasion had the\r\ngood fortune to please even the critical David Deans, though it was only\r\nan hour and a quarter long, which David termed a short allowance of\r\nspiritual provender.\r\n\r\nThe preacher, who was a divine that held many of David\xc3\xads opinions,\r\nprivately apologised for his brevity by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat he observed the\r\nCaptain was gaunting grievously, and that if he had detained him longer,\r\nthere was no knowing how long he might be in paying the next term\xc3\xads\r\nvictual stipend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid groaned to find that such carnal motives could have influence upon\r\nthe mind of a powerful preacher. He had, indeed, been scandalised by\r\nanother circumstance during the service.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the congregation were seated after prayers, and the clergyman\r\nhad read his text, the gracious Duncan, after rummaging the leathern\r\npurse which hung in front of his petticoat, produced a short tobacco-pipe\r\nmade of iron, and observed, almost aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI hae forgotten my\r\nspleuchan--Lachlan, gang down to the clachan, and bring me up a\r\npennyworth of twist.\xe2\x80\x9d Six arms, the nearest within reach, presented,\r\nwith an obedient start, as many tobacco-pouches to the man of office.\r\nHe made choice of one with an nod of acknowledgment, filled his pipe,\r\nlighted it with the assistance of his pistol-flint, and smoked with\r\ninfinite composure during the whole time of the sermon. When the\r\ndiscourse was finished, he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, replaced\r\nit in his sporran, returned the tobacco-pouch or spleuchan to its owner,\r\nand joined in the prayer with decency and attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Captain of Knockdunder--303]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the service, when Butler had been admitted minister of the\r\nkirk of Knocktarlitie, with all its spiritual immunities and privileges,\r\nDavid, who had frowned, groaned, and murmured at Knockdunder\xc3\xads irreverent\r\ndemeanour, communicated his plain thoughts of the matter to Isaac\r\nMeiklehose, one of the elders, with whom a reverential aspect and huge\r\ngrizzle wig had especially disposed him to seek fraternisation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt didna\r\nbecome a wild Indian,\xe2\x80\x9d David said, \xe2\x80\x9cmuch less a Christian, and a\r\ngentleman, to sit in the kirk puffing tobacco-reek, as if he were in a\r\nchange-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeiklehose shook his head, and allowed it was \xe2\x80\x9cfar frae beseeming--But\r\nwhat will ye say? The Captain\xc3\xads a queer hand, and to speak to him about\r\nthat or onything else that crosses the maggot, wad be to set the kiln\r\na-low. He keeps a high hand ower the country, and we couldna deal wi\xc3\xad the\r\nHielandmen without his protection, sin\xc3\xad a\xc3\xad the keys o\xc3\xad the kintray hings\r\nat his belt; and he\xc3\xads no an ill body in the main, and maistry, ye ken,\r\nmaws the meadows doun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be very true, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d said David; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Reuben Butler isna\r\nthe man I take him to be, if he disna learn the Captain to fuff his pipe\r\nsome other gate than in God\xc3\xads house, or the quarter be ower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFair and softly gangs far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Meiklehose; \xe2\x80\x9cand if a fule may gie a\r\nwise man a counsel, I wad hae him think twice or he mells with\r\nKnockdunder--He auld hae a lang-shankit spune that wad sup kail wi\xc3\xad the\r\ndeil. But they are a\xc3\xad away to their dinner to the change-house, and if we\r\ndinna mend our pace, we\xc3\xadll come short at meal-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavid accompanied his friend without answer; but began to feel from\r\nexperience, that the glen of Knocktarlitie, like the rest of the world,\r\nwas haunted by its own special subjects of regret and discontent. His\r\nmind was, so much occupied by considering the best means of converting\r\nDuncan of Knock to a sense of reverend decency during public worship,\r\nthat he altogether forgot to inquire whether Butler was called upon to\r\nsubscribe the oaths to Government.\r\n\r\nSome have insinuated, that his neglect on this head was, in some degree,\r\nintentional; but I think this explanation inconsistent with the\r\nsimplicity of my friend David\xc3\xads character. Neither have I ever been able,\r\nby the most minute inquiries, to know whether the _formula,_ at which he\r\nso much scrupled, had been exacted from Butler, ay or no. The books of\r\nthe kirk-session might have thrown some light on this matter; but\r\nunfortunately they were destroyed in the year 1746, by one Donacha Dhu na\r\nDunaigh, at the instance, it was said, or at least by the connivance, of\r\nthe gracious Duncan of Knock, who had a desire to obliterate the recorded\r\nfoibles of a certain Kate Finlayson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND.\r\n\r\n                Now butt and ben the change-house fills\r\n                      Wi\xc3\xad yill-caup commentators,\r\n               Here\xc3\xads crying out for bakes and gills,\r\n                     And there the pint-stoup clatters.\r\n               Wi\xc3\xad thick and thrang, and loud and lang,--\r\n                     Wi\xc3\xad logic and wi\xc3\xad scripture,\r\n               They raise a din that in the end\r\n                      Is like to breed a rupture,\r\n                          O\xc3\xad wrath that day.\r\n                                            Burns.\r\n\r\nA plentiful entertainment, at the Duke of Argyle\xc3\xads cost, regaled the\r\nreverend gentlemen who had assisted at the ordination of Reuben Butler,\r\nand almost all the respectable part of the parish. The feast was, indeed,\r\nsuch as the country itself furnished; for plenty of all the requisites\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x9ca rough and round dinner\xe2\x80\x9d were always at Duncan of Knock\xc3\xads command.\r\nThere was the beef and mutton on the braes, the fresh and salt-water fish\r\nin the lochs, the brooks, and firth; game of every kind, from the deer to\r\nthe leveret, were to be had for the killing, in the Duke\xc3\xads forests,\r\nmoors, heaths, and mosses; and for liquor, home-brewed ale flowed as\r\nfreely as water; brandy and usquebaugh both were had in those happy times\r\nwithout duty; even white wine and claret were got for nothing, since the\r\nDuke\xc3\xads extensive rights of admiralty gave him a title to all the wine in\r\ncask which is drifted ashore on the western coast and isles of Scotland,\r\nwhen shipping have suffered by severe weather. In short, as Duncan\r\nboasted, the entertainment did not cost MacCallummore a plack out of his\r\nsporran, and was nevertheless not only liberal, but overflowing.\r\n\r\nThe Duke\xc3\xads health was solemnised in a _bona fide_ bumper, and David Deans\r\nhimself added perhaps the first huzza that his lungs had ever uttered, to\r\nswell the shout with which the pledge was received. Nay, so exalted in\r\nheart was he upon this memorable occasion, and so much disposed to be\r\nindulgent, that, he expressed no dissatisfaction when three bagpipers\r\nstruck up, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Campbells are coming.\xe2\x80\x9d The health of the reverend\r\nminister of Knocktarlitie was received with similar honours; and there\r\nwas a roar of laughter, when one of his brethren slily subjoined the\r\naddition of, \xe2\x80\x9cA good wife to our brother, to keep the Manse in order.\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nthis occasion David Deans was delivered of his first-born joke; and\r\napparently the parturition was accompanied with many throes, for sorely\r\ndid he twist about his physiognomy, and much did he stumble in his\r\nspeech, before he could express his idea, \xe2\x80\x9cThat the lad being now wedded\r\nto his spiritual bride, it was hard to threaten him with ane temporal\r\nspouse in the same day.\xe2\x80\x9d He then laughed a hoarse and brief laugh, and\r\nwas suddenly grave and silent, as if abashed at his own vivacious effort.\r\n\r\nAfter another toast or two, Jeanie, Mrs. Dolly, and such of the female\r\nnatives as had honoured the feast with their presence, retired to David\xc3\xads\r\nnew dwelling at Auchingower, and left the gentlemen to their potations.\r\n\r\nThe feast proceeded with great glee. The conversation, where Duncan had\r\nit under his direction, was not indeed always strictly canonical, but\r\nDavid Deans escaped any risk of being scandalised, by engaging with one\r\nof his neighbours in a recapitulation of the sufferings of Ayrshire and\r\nLanarkshire, during what was called the invasion of the Highland Host;\r\nthe prudent Mr. Meiklehose cautioning them from time to time to lower\r\ntheir voices, \xe2\x80\x9cfor that Duncan Knock\xc3\xads father had been at that onslaught,\r\nand brought back muckle gude plenishing, and that Duncan was no unlikely\r\nto hae been there himself, for what he kend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as the mirth grew fast and furious, the graver members of the\r\nparty began to escape as well as they could. David Deans accomplished his\r\nretreat, and Butler anxiously watched an opportunity to follow him.\r\nKnockdunder, however, desirous, he said, of knowing what stuff was in the\r\nnew minister, had no intention to part with him so easily, but kept him\r\npinned to his side, watching him sedulously, and with obliging violence\r\nfilling his glass to the brim, as often as he could seize an opportunity\r\nof doing so. At length, as the evening was wearing late, a venerable\r\nbrother chanced to ask Mr. Archibald when they might hope to see the\r\nDuke, _tam carum caput,_ as he would venture to term him, at the Lodge of\r\nRoseneath. Duncan of Knock, whose ideas were somewhat conglomerated, and\r\nwho, it may be believed, was no great scholar, catching up some imperfect\r\nsound of the words, conceived the speaker was drawing a parallel between\r\nthe Duke and Sir Donald Gorme of Sleat; and being of opinion that such\r\ncomparison was odious, snorted thrice, and prepared himself to be in a\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nTo the explanation of the venerable divine the Captain answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard\r\nthe word Gorme myself, sir, with my ain ears. D\xc3\xadye think I do not know\r\nGaelic from Latin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApparently not, sir;\xe2\x80\x9d--so the clergyman, offended in his turn, and\r\ntaking a pinch of snuff, answered with great coolness.\r\n\r\nThe copper nose of the gracious Duncan now became heated like the Bull of\r\nPhalaris, and while Mr. Archibald mediated betwixt the offended parties,\r\nand the attention of the company was engaged by their dispute, Butler\r\ntook an opportunity to effect his retreat.\r\n\r\nHe found the females at Auchingower very anxious for the breaking up of\r\nthe convivial party; for it was a part of the arrangement, that although\r\nDavid Deans was to remain at Auchingower, and Butler was that night to\r\ntake possession of the Manse, yet Jeanie, for whom complete\r\naccommodations were not yet provided in her father\xc3\xads house, was to return\r\nfor a day or two to the Lodge at Roseneath, and the boats had been held\r\nin readiness accordingly. They waited, therefore, for Knockdunder\xc3\xads\r\nreturn, but twilight came, and they still waited in vain. At length Mr.\r\nArchibald, who was a man of decorum, had taken care not to exceed in his\r\nconviviality, made his appearance, and advised the females strongly to\r\nreturn to the island under his escort; observing, that, from the humour\r\nin which he had left the Captain, it was a great chance whether he budged\r\nout of the public-house that night, and it was absolutely certain that he\r\nwould not be very fit company for ladies. The gig was at their disposal,\r\nhe said, and there was still pleasant twilight for a party on the water.\r\n\r\nJeanie, who had considerable confidence in Archibald\xc3\xads prudence,\r\nimmediately acquiesced in this proposal; but Mrs. Dolly positively\r\nobjected to the small boat. If the big boat could be gotten, she agreed\r\nto set out, otherwise she would sleep on the floor, rather than stir a\r\nstep. Reasoning with Dolly was out of the question, and Archibald did not\r\nthink the difficulty so pressing as to require compulsion. He observed,\r\nit was not using the Captain very politely to deprive him of his coach\r\nand six; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as it was in the ladies\xc3\xad service,\xe2\x80\x9d he gallantly said, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nwould use so much freedom--besides the gig would serve the Captain\xc3\xads\r\npurpose better, as it could come off at any hour of the tide; the large\r\nboat should, therefore, be at Mrs. Dolly\xc3\xads service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked to the beach accordingly, accompanied by Butler. It was some\r\ntime before the boatmen could be assembled, and ere they were well\r\nembarked, and ready to depart, the pale moon was come over the hill, and\r\nflinging a trembling reflection on the broad and glittering waves. But so\r\nsoft and pleasant was the night, that Butler, in bidding farewell to\r\nJeanie, had no apprehension for her safety; and what is yet more\r\nextraordinary, Mrs. Dolly felt no alarm for her own. The air was soft,\r\nand came over the cooling wave with something of summer fragrance. The\r\nbeautiful scene of headlands, and capes, and bays, around them, with the\r\nbroad blue chain of mountains, were dimly visible in the moonlight; while\r\nevery dash of the oars made the waters glance and sparkle with the\r\nbrilliant phenomenon called the sea fire.\r\n\r\nThis last circumstance filled Jeanie with wonder, and served to amuse the\r\nmind of her companion, until they approached the little bay, which seemed\r\nto stretch its dark and wooded arms into the sea as if to welcome them.\r\n\r\nThe usual landing-place was at a quarter of a mile\xc3\xads distance from the\r\nLodge, and although the tide did not admit of the large boat coming quite\r\nclose to the jetty of loose stones which served as a pier, Jeanie, who\r\nwas both bold and active, easily sprung ashore; but Mrs., Dolly\r\npositively refusing to commit herself to the same risk, the complaisant\r\nMr. Archibald ordered the boat round to a more regular landing-place, at\r\na considerable distance along the shore. He then prepared to land\r\nhimself, that he might, in the meanwhile, accompany Jeanie to the Lodge.\r\nBut as there was no mistaking the woodland lane, which led from thence to\r\nthe shore, and as the moonlight showed her one of the white chimneys\r\nrising out of the wood which embosomed the building, Jeanie declined this\r\nfavour with thanks, and requested him to proceed with Mrs. Dolly, who,\r\nbeing \xe2\x80\x9cin a country where the ways were so strange to her, had mair need\r\nof countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was a fortunate circumstance, and might even be said to\r\nsave poor Cowslip\xc3\xads life, if it was true, as she herself used solemnly to\r\naver, that she must positively have expired for fear, if she had been\r\nleft alone in the boat with six wild Highlanders in kilts.\r\n\r\nThe night was so exquisitely beautiful, that Jeanie, instead of\r\nimmediately directing her course towards the Lodge, stood looking after\r\nthe boat as it again put off from the side, and rowed into the little\r\nbay, the dark figures of her companions growing less and less distinct as\r\nthey diminished in the distance, and the jorram, or melancholy boat-song\r\nof the rowers, coming on the ear with softened and sweeter sound, until\r\nthe boat rounded the headland, and was lost to her observation.\r\n\r\nStill Jeanie remained in the same posture, looking out upon the sea. It\r\nwould, she was aware, be some time ere her companions could reach the\r\nLodge, as the distance by the more convenient landing-place was\r\nconsiderably greater than from the point where she stood, and she was not\r\nsorry to have an opportunity to spend the interval by herself.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful change which a few weeks had wrought in her situation, from\r\nshame and grief, and almost despair, to honour, joy, and a fair prospect\r\nof future happiness, passed before her eyes with a sensation which\r\nbrought the tears into them. Yet they flowed at the same time from\r\nanother source. As human happiness is never perfect, and as\r\nwell-constructed minds are never more sensible of the distresses of those\r\nwhom they love, than when their own situation forms a contrast with them,\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads affectionate regrets turned to the fate of her poor sister--the\r\nchild of so many hopes--the fondled nursling of so many years--now an\r\nexile, and, what was worse, dependent on the will of a man, of whose\r\nhabits she had every reason to entertain the worst opinion, and who, even\r\nin his strongest paroxysms of remorse, had appeared too much a stranger\r\nto the feelings of real penitence.\r\n\r\nWhile her thoughts were occupied with these melancholy reflections, a\r\nshadowy figure seemed to detach itself from the copsewood on her right\r\nhand. Jeanie started, and the stories of apparitions and wraiths, seen by\r\nsolitary travellers in wild situations, at such times, and in such an\r\nhour, suddenly came full upon her imagination. The figure glided on, and\r\nas it came betwixt her and the moon, she was aware that it had the\r\nappearance of a woman. A soft voice twice repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cJeanie--Jeanie!\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\nWas it indeed--could it be the voice of her sister?--Was she still among\r\nthe living, or had the grave given up its tenant?--Ere she could state\r\nthese questions to her own mind, Effie, alive, and in the body, had\r\nclasped her in her arms and was straining her to her bosom, and devouring\r\nher with kisses. \xe2\x80\x9cI have wandered here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9clike a ghaist, to see\r\nyou, and nae wonder you take me for ane--I thought but to see you gang\r\nby, or to hear the sound of your voice; but to speak to yoursell again,\r\nJeanie, was mair than I deserved, and mair than I durst pray for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Effie! how came ye here alone, and at this hour, and on the wild\r\nseabeach?--Are you sure it\xc3\xads your ain living sell?\xe2\x80\x9d There was something\r\nof Effie\xc3\xads former humour in her practically answering the question by a\r\ngentle pinch, more beseeming the fingers of a fairy than of a ghost. And\r\nagain the sisters embraced, and laughed, and wept by turns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ye maun gang up wi\xc3\xad me to the Lodge, Effie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell\r\nme a\xc3\xad your story--I hae gude folk there that will make ye welcome for my\r\nsake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa, na, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her sister sorrowfully,--\xe2\x80\x9cye hae forgotten what\r\nI am--a banished outlawed creature, scarce escaped the gallows by your\r\nbeing the bauldest and the best sister that ever lived--I\xc3\xadll gae near\r\nnane o\xc3\xad your grand friends, even if there was nae danger to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nae danger--there shall be nae danger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nEffie, dinna be wilfu\xc3\xad--be guided for ance--we will be sae happy a\xc3\xad\r\nthegither!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a\xc3\xad the happiness I deserve on this side of the grave, now that I\r\nhae seen you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Effie; \xe2\x80\x9cand whether there were danger to mysell\r\nor no, naebody shall ever say that I come with my cheat-the-gallows face\r\nto shame my sister among her grand friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hae nae grand friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cnae friends but what are friends\r\nof yours--Reuben Butler and my father.--O unhappy lassie, dinna be dour,\r\nand turn your back on your happiness again! We wunna see another\r\nacquaintance--Come hame to us, your ain dearest friends--it\xc3\xads better\r\nsheltering under an auld hedge than under a new-planted wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xc3\xads in vain speaking, Jeanie,--I maun drink as I hae brewed--I am\r\nmarried, and I maun follow my husband for better for worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried, Effie!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Jeanie--\xe2\x80\x9cMisfortunate creature! and to that\r\nawfu\xc3\xad--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, clapping one hand on her mouth, and pointing to\r\nthe thicket with the other, \xe2\x80\x9che is yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d She said this in a tone which\r\nshowed that her husband had found means to inspire her with awe, as well\r\nas affection. At this moment a man issued from the wood.\r\n\r\nIt was young Staunton. Even by the imperfect light of the moon, Jeanie\r\ncould observe that he was handsomely dressed, and had the air of a person\r\nof rank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEffie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cour time is well-nigh spent--the skiff will be aground\r\nin the creek, and I dare not stay longer.--I hope your sister will allow\r\nme to salute her?\xe2\x80\x9d But Jeanie shrunk back from him with a feeling of\r\ninternal abhorrence. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit does not much signify; if you\r\nkeep up the feeling of ill-will, at least you do not act upon it, and I\r\nthank you for your respect to my secret, when a word (which in your place\r\nI would have spoken at once) would have cost me my life. People say, you\r\nshould keep from the wife of your bosom the secret that concerns your\r\nneck--my wife and her sister both know mine, and I shall not sleep a wink\r\nthe less sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you really married to my sister, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jeanie, in great\r\ndoubt and anxiety; for the haughty, careless tone in which he spoke\r\nseemed to justify her worst apprehensions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really am legally married, and by my own name,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Staunton, more\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your father--and your friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my father and my friends must just reconcile themselves to that\r\nwhich is done and cannot be undone,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Staunton. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, it is my\r\nintention, in order to break off dangerous connections, and to let my\r\nfriends come to their temper, to conceal my marriage for the present, and\r\nstay abroad for some years. So that you will not hear of us for some\r\ntime, if ever you hear of us again at all. It would be dangerous, you\r\nmust be aware, to keep up the correspondence; for all would guess that\r\nthe husband of Effie was the--what shall I call myself?--the slayer of\r\nPorteous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHard-hearted light man! thought Jeanie--to what a character she has\r\nintrusted her happiness!--She has sown the wind, and maun reap the\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinna think ill o\xc3\xad him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Effie, breaking away from her husband, and\r\nleading Jeanie a step or two out of hearing--\xe2\x80\x9cdinna think very ill o\xc3\xad\r\nhim--he\xc3\xads gude to me, Jeanie--as gude as I deserve--And he is determined\r\nto gie up his bad courses--Sae, after a\xc3\xad, dinna greet for Effie; she is\r\nbetter off than she has wrought for.--But you--oh, you!--how can you be\r\nhappy eneugh! never till ye get to heaven, where a\xc3\xadbody is as gude as\r\nyoursell.--Jeanie, if I live and thrive, ye shall hear of me--if not,\r\njust forget that sic a creature ever lived to vex ye--fare ye\r\nweel--fare--fare ye weel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tore herself from her sister\xc3\xads arms--rejoined her husband--they\r\nplunged into the copsewood, and she saw them no more. The whole scene had\r\nthe effect of a vision, and she could almost have believed it such, but\r\nthat very soon after they quitted her, she heard the sound of oars, and a\r\nskiff was seen on the firth, pulling swiftly towards the small smuggling\r\nsloop which lay in the offing. It was on board of such a vessel that\r\nEffie had embarked at Portobello, and Jeanie had no doubt that the same\r\nconveyance was destined, as Staunton had hinted, to transport them to a\r\nforeign country.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was impossible to determine whether this interview, while it\r\nwas passing, gave more pain or pleasure to Jeanie Deans, yet the ultimate\r\nimpression which remained on her mind was decidedly favourable. Effie was\r\nmarried--made, according to the common phrase, an honest woman--that was\r\none main point; it seemed also as if her husband were about to\r\nabandon the path of gross vice in which he had run so long and so\r\ndesperately--that was another. For his final and effectual conversion\r\nhe did not want understanding, and God knew his own hour.\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts with which Jeanie endeavoured to console her\r\nanxiety respecting her sister\xc3\xads future fortune. On her arrival at the\r\nlodge, she found Archibald in some anxiety at her stay, and about to walk\r\nout in quest of her. A headache served as an apology for retiring to\r\nrest, in order to conceal her visible agitation of mind from her\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nBy this secession also she escaped a scene of a different sort. For, as\r\nif there were danger in all gigs, whether by sea or land, that of\r\nKnockdunder had been run down by another boat, an accident owing chiefly\r\nto the drunkenness of the Captain, his crew, and passengers. Knockdunder,\r\nand two or three guests, whom he was bringing along with him to finish\r\nthe conviviality of the evening at the Lodge, got a sound ducking; but,\r\nbeing rescued by the crew of the boat which endangered them, there was no\r\nultimate loss, excepting that of the Captain\xc3\xads laced hat, which, greatly\r\nto the satisfaction of the Highland part of the district, as well as to\r\nthe improvement of the conformity of his own personal appearance, he\r\nreplaced by a smart Highland bonnet next day. Many were the vehement\r\nthreats of vengeance which, on the succeeding morning, the gracious\r\nDuncan threw out against the boat which had upset him; but as neither\r\nshe, nor the small smuggling vessel to which she belonged, was any longer\r\nto be seen in the firth, he was compelled to sit down with the affront.\r\nThis was the more hard, he said, as he was assured the mischief was done\r\non purpose, these scoundrels having lurked about after they had landed\r\nevery drop of brandy, and every bag of tea they had on board; and he\r\nunderstood the coxswain had been on shore, making particular inquiries\r\nconcerning the time when his boat was to cross over, and to return, and\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the neist time they meet me on the firth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, with great\r\nmajesty, \xe2\x80\x9cI will teach the moonlight rapscallions and vagabonds to keep\r\ntheir ain side of the road, and pe tamn\xc3\xadd to them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THIRD.\r\n\r\n              Lord! who would live turmoiled in a court,\r\n              And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?\r\n                                        Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nWithin a reasonable time after Butler was safely and comfortably settled\r\nin his living, and Jeanie had taken up her abode at Auchingower with her\r\nfather,--the precise extent of which interval we request each reader to\r\nsettle according to his own sense of what is decent and proper upon the\r\noccasion,--and after due proclamation of banns, and all other\r\nformalities, the long wooing of this worthy pair was ended by their union\r\nin the holy bands of matrimony. On this occasion, David Deans stoutly\r\nwithstood the iniquities of pipes, fiddles, and promiscuous dancing, to\r\nthe great wrath of the Captain of Knockdunder, who said, if he \xe2\x80\x9chad\r\nguessed it was to be sic a tamn\xc3\xadd Quakers\xc3\xad meeting, he wad hae seen them\r\npeyont the cairn before he wad hae darkened their doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so much rancour remained on the spirits of the gracious Duncan upon\r\nthis occasion, that various \xe2\x80\x9cpicqueerings,\xe2\x80\x9d as David called them, took\r\nplace upon the same and similar topics and it was only in consequence of\r\nan accidental visit of the Duke to his Lodge at Roseneath, that they were\r\nput a stop to. But upon that occasion his Grace showed such particular\r\nrespect to Mr. and Mrs. Butler, and such favour even to old David, that\r\nKnockdunder held it prudent to change his course towards the latter. He,\r\nin future, used to express himself among friends, concerning the minister\r\nand his wife, as \xe2\x80\x9cvery worthy decent folk, just a little over strict in\r\ntheir notions; put it was pest for thae plack cattle to err on the safe\r\nside.\xe2\x80\x9d And respecting David, he allowed that \xe2\x80\x9che was an excellent judge\r\nof nowte and sheep, and a sensible eneugh carle, an it werena for his\r\ntamn\xc3\xadd Cameronian nonsense, whilk it is not worth while of a shentleman\r\nto knock out of an auld silly head, either by force of reason or\r\notherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d So that, by avoiding topics of dispute, the personages of our\r\ntale lived in great good habits with the gracious Duncan, only that he\r\nstill grieved David\xc3\xads soul, and set a perilous example to the\r\ncongregation, by sometimes bringing his pipe to the church during a cold\r\nwinter day, and almost always sleeping during sermon in the summer time.\r\n\r\nMrs. Butler, whom we must no longer, if we can help it, term by the\r\nfamiliar name of Jeanie, brought into the married state the same firm\r\nmind and affectionate disposition--the same natural and homely good\r\nsense, and spirit of useful exertion--in a word, all the domestic good\r\nqualities of which she had given proof during her maiden life. She did\r\nnot indeed rival Butler in learning; but then no woman more devoutly\r\nvenerated the extent of her husband\xc3\xads erudition. She did not pretend to\r\nunderstand his expositions of divinity; but no minister of the Presbytery\r\nhad his humble dinner so well arranged, his clothes and linen in equal\r\ngood order, his fireside so neatly swept, his parlour so clean, and his\r\nbooks so well dusted.\r\n\r\nIf he talked to Jeanie of what she did not understand--and (for the man\r\nwas mortal, and had been a schoolmaster) he sometimes did harangue more\r\nscholarly and wisely than was necessary--she listened in placid silence;\r\nand whenever the point referred to common life, and was such as came\r\nunder the grasp of a strong natural understanding, her views were more\r\nforcible, and her observations more acute, than his own. In acquired\r\npoliteness of manners, when it happened that she mingled a little in\r\nsociety, Mrs. Butler was, of course, judged deficient. But then she had\r\nthat obvious wish to oblige, and that real and natural good-breeding\r\ndepending on, good sense and good humour, which, joined to a considerable\r\ndegree of archness and liveliness of manner, rendered her behaviour\r\nacceptable to all with whom she was called upon to associate.\r\nNotwithstanding her strict attention to all domestic affairs, she always\r\nappeared the clean well-dressed mistress of the house, never the sordid\r\nhousehold drudge. When complimented on this occasion by Duncan Knock, who\r\nswore \xe2\x80\x9cthat he thought the fairies must help her, since her house was\r\nalways clean, and nobody ever saw anybody sweeping it,\xe2\x80\x9d she modestly\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat much might be dune by timing ane\xc3\xads turns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan replied, \xe2\x80\x9cHe heartily wished she could teach that art to the\r\nhuzzies at the Lodge, for he could never discover that the house was\r\nwashed at a\xc3\xad, except now and then by breaking his shins over the pail--\r\nCot tamn the jauds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf lesser matters there is not occasion to speak much. It may easily be\r\nbelieved that the Duke\xc3\xads cheese was carefully made, and so graciously\r\naccepted, that the offering became annual. Remembrances and\r\nacknowledgments of past favours were sent to Mrs. Bickerton and Mrs.\r\nGlass, and an amicable intercourse maintained from time to time with\r\nthese two respectable and benevolent persons.\r\n\r\nIt is especially necessary to mention that, in the course of five years,\r\nMrs. Butler had three children, two boys and a girl, all stout healthy\r\nbabes of grace, fair-haired, blue-eyed, and strong-limbed. The boys were\r\nnamed David and Reuben, an order of nomenclature which was much to the\r\nsatisfaction of the old hero of the Covenant, and the girl, by her\r\nmother\xc3\xads special desire, was christened Euphemia, rather contrary to the\r\nwish both of her father and husband, who nevertheless loved Mrs. Butler\r\ntoo well, and were too much indebted to her for their hours of happiness,\r\nto withstand any request which she made with earnestness, and as a\r\ngratification to herself. But from some feeling, I know not of what kind,\r\nthe child was never distinguished by the name of Effie, but by the\r\nabbreviation of Femie, which in Scotland is equally commonly applied to\r\npersons called Euphemia.\r\n\r\nIn this state of quiet and unostentatious enjoyment, there were, besides\r\nthe ordinary rubs and ruffles which disturb even the most uniform life,\r\ntwo things which particularly chequered Mrs. Butler\xc3\xads happiness. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout\r\nthese,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to our informer, \xe2\x80\x9cher life would have been but too\r\nhappy; and perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cshe had need of some crosses in this\r\nworld to remind her that there was a better to come behind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first of these related to certain polemical skirmishes betwixt her\r\nfather and her husband, which, notwithstanding the mutual respect and\r\naffection they entertained for each other, and their great love for\r\nher--notwithstanding, also, their general agreement in strictness, and\r\neven severity, of Presbyterian principle--often threatened unpleasant\r\nweather between them. David Deans, as our readers must be aware, was\r\nsufficiently opinionative and intractable, and having prevailed on\r\nhimself to become a member of a kirk-session under the Established\r\nChurch, he felt doubly obliged to evince that, in so doing, he had not\r\ncompromised any whit of his former professions, either in practice or\r\nprinciple. Now Mr. Butler, doing all credit to his father-in-law\xc3\xads\r\nmotives, was frequently of opinion that it were better to drop out of\r\nmemory points of division and separation, and to act in the manner most\r\nlikely to attract and unite all parties who were serious in religion.\r\nMoreover, he was not pleased, as a man and a scholar, to be always\r\ndictated to by his unlettered father-in-law; and as a clergyman, he did\r\nnot think it fit to seem for ever under the thumb of an elder of his own\r\nkirk-session. A proud but honest thought carried his opposition now and\r\nthen a little farther than it would otherwise have gone. \xe2\x80\x9cMy brethren,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill suppose I am flattering and conciliating the old man for\r\nthe sake of his succession, if I defer and give way to him on every\r\noccasion; and, besides, there are many on which I neither can nor will\r\nconscientiously yield to his notions. I cannot be persecuting old women\r\nfor witches, or ferreting out matter of scandal among the young ones,\r\nwhich might otherwise have remained concealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this difference of opinion it happened that, in many cases of\r\nnicety, such as in owning certain defections, and failing to testify\r\nagainst certain backslidings of the time, in not always severely tracing\r\nforth little matters of scandal and _fama clamosa,_ which David called a\r\nloosening of the reins of discipline, and in failing to demand clear\r\ntestimonies in other points of controversy which had, as it were, drifted\r\nto leeward with the change of times, Butler incurred the censure of his\r\nfather-in-law; and sometimes the disputes betwixt them became eager and\r\nalmost unfriendly. In all such cases Mrs Butler was a mediating spirit,\r\nwho endeavoured, by the alkaline smoothness of her own disposition, to\r\nneutralise the acidity of theological controversy. To the complaints of\r\nboth she lent an unprejudiced and attentive ear, and sought always rather\r\nto excuse than absolutely to defend the other party.\r\n\r\nShe reminded her father that Butler had not \xe2\x80\x9chis experience of the auld\r\nand wrastling times, when folk were gifted wi\xc3\xad a far look into eternity,\r\nto make up for the oppressions whilk they suffered here below in time.\r\nShe freely allowed that many devout ministers and professors in times\r\npast had enjoyed downright revelation, like the blessed Peden, and\r\nLundie, and Cameron, and Renwick, and John Caird the tinkler, wha entered\r\ninto the secrets, and Elizabeth Melvil, Lady Culross, wha prayed in her\r\nbed, surrounded by a great many Christians in a large room, in whilk it\r\nwas placed on purpose, and that for three hours\xc3\xad time, with wonderful\r\nassistance; and Lady Robertland, whilk got six sure outgates of grace,\r\nand mony other in times past; and of a specially, Mr. John Scrimgeour,\r\nminister of Kinghorn, who, having a beloved child sick to death of the\r\ncrewels, was free to expostulate with his Maker with such impatience of\r\ndispleasure, and complaining so bitterly, that at length it was said unto\r\nhim, that he was heard for this time, but that he was requested to use no\r\nsuch boldness in time coming; so that when he returned he found the child\r\nsitting up in the bed hale and fair, with all its wounds closed, and\r\nsupping its parritch, whilk babe he had left at the time of death. But\r\nthough these things might be true in these needful times, she contended\r\nthat those ministers who had not seen such vouchsafed and especial\r\nmercies, were to seek their rule in the records of ancient times; and\r\ntherefore Reuben was carefu\xc3\xad both to search the Scriptures and the books\r\nwritten by wise and good men of old; and sometimes in this way it wad\r\nhappen that twa precious saints might pu\xc3\xad sundry wise, like twa cows\r\nriving at the same hayband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this David used to reply, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, hinny, thou kenn\xc3\xadst little\r\no\xc3\xadt; but that saam John Scrimgeour, that blew open the gates of heaven as\r\nan it had been wi\xc3\xad a sax-pund cannonball, used devoutly to wish that most\r\npart of books were burnt, except the Bible. Reuben\xc3\xads a gude lad and a\r\nkind--I have aye allowed that; but as to his not allowing inquiry anent\r\nthe scandal of Marjory Kittlesides and Rory MacRand, under pretence that\r\nthey have southered sin wi\xc3\xad marriage, it\xc3\xads clear agane the Christian\r\ndiscipline o\xc3\xad the kirk. And then there\xc3\xads Aily MacClure of Deepheugh, that\r\npractises her abominations, spacing folks\xc3\xad fortunes wi\xc3\xad egg-shells, and\r\nmutton-banes, and dreams and divinations, whilk is a scandal to ony\r\nChristian land to suffer sic a wretch to live; and I\xc3\xadll uphaud that, in\r\na\xc3\xad judicatures, civil or ecclesiastical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay ye are very right, father,\xe2\x80\x9d was the general style of Jeanie\xc3\xads\r\nanswer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut ye maun come down to the Manse to your dinner the day. The\r\nbits o\xc3\xad bairns, puir things, are wearying to see their luckie dad; and\r\nReuben never sleeps weel, nor I neither, when you and he hae had ony bit\r\noutcast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNae outcast, Jeanie; God forbid I suld cast out wi\xc3\xad thee, or aught that\r\nis dear to thee!\xe2\x80\x9d And he put on his Sundays coat, and came to the Manse\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nWith her husband, Mrs. Butler had a more direct conciliatory process.\r\nReuben had the utmost respect for the old man\xc3\xads motives, and affection\r\nfor his person, as well as gratitude for his early friendship. So that,\r\nupon any such occasion of accidental irritation, it was only necessary to\r\nremind him with delicacy of his father-in-law\xc3\xads age, of his scanty\r\neducation, strong prejudices, and family distresses. The least of these\r\nconsiderations always inclined Butler to measures of conciliation, in so\r\nfar as he could accede to them without compromising principle; and thus\r\nour simple and unpretending heroine had the merit of those peacemakers,\r\nto whom it is pronounced as a benediction, that they shall inherit the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe second crook in Mrs. Butler\xc3\xads lot, to use the language of her father,\r\nwas the distressing circumstance, that she had never heard of her\r\nsister\xc3\xads safety, or of the circumstances in which she found herself,\r\nthough betwixt four and five years had elapsed since they had parted on\r\nthe beach of the island of Roseneath. Frequent intercourse was not to be\r\nexpected--not to be desired, perhaps, in their relative situations; but\r\nEffie had promised, that, if she lived and prospered, her sister should\r\nhear from her. She must then be no more, or sunk into some abyss of\r\nmisery, since she had never redeemed her pledge. Her silence seemed\r\nstrange and portentous, and wrung from Jeanie, who could never forget the\r\nearly years of their intimacy, the most painful anticipation concerning\r\nher fate. At length, however, the veil was drawn aside.\r\n\r\nOne day, as the Captain of Knockdunder had called in at the Manse, on his\r\nreturn from some business in the Highland part of the parish, and had\r\nbeen accommodated, according to his special request, with a mixture of\r\nmilk, brandy, honey, and water, which he said Mrs. Butler compounded\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpotter than ever a woman in Scotland,\xe2\x80\x9d--for, in all innocent matters,\r\nshe studied the taste of every one around her,--he said to Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cPy\r\nthe py, minister, I have a letter here either for your canny pody of a\r\nwife or you, which I got when I was last at Glasco; the postage comes to\r\nfourpence, which you may either pay me forthwith, or give me tooble or\r\nquits in a hit at packcammon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe playing at backgammon and draughts had been a frequent amusement of\r\nMr. Whackbairn, Butler\xc3\xads principal, when at Liberton school. The\r\nminister, therefore, still piqued himself on his skill at both games, and\r\noccasionally practised them, as strictly canonical, although David Deans,\r\nwhose notions of every kind were more rigorous, used to shake his head,\r\nand groan grievously, when he espied the tables lying in the parlour, or\r\nthe children playing with the dice boxes or backgammon men. Indeed, Mrs.\r\nButler was sometimes chidden for removing these implements of pastime\r\ninto some closet or corner out of sight. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them be where they are,\r\nJeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d would Butler say upon such occasions; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not conscious of\r\nfollowing this, or any other trifling relaxation, to the interruption of\r\nmy more serious studies, and still more serious duties. I will not,\r\ntherefore, have it supposed that I am indulging by stealth, and against\r\nmy conscience, in an amusement which, using it so little as I do, I may\r\nwell practise openly, and without any check of mind--_Nil conscire sibi,_\r\nJeanie, that is my motto; which signifies, my love, the honest and open\r\nconfidence which a man ought to entertain when he is acting openly, and\r\nwithout any sense of doing wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch being Butler\xc3\xads humour, he accepted the Captain\xc3\xads defiance to a\r\ntwopenny hit at backgammon, and handed the letter to his wife, observing\r\nthe post-mark was York, but, if it came from her friend Mrs. Bickerton,\r\nshe had considerably improved her handwriting, which was uncommon at her\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nLeaving the gentlemen to their game, Mrs. Butler went to order something\r\nfor supper, for Captain Duncan had proposed kindly to stay the night with\r\nthem, and then carelessly broke open her letter. It was not from Mrs.\r\nBickerton; and, after glancing over the first few lines, she soon found\r\nit necessary to retire to her own bedroom, to read the document at\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTH.\r\n\r\n                    Happy thou art! then happy be,\r\n                          Nor envy me my lot;\r\n                    Thy happy state I envy thee,\r\n                          And peaceful cot.\r\n                                  Lady Charlotte Campbell.\r\n\r\nThe letter, which Mrs. Butler, when retired into her own apartment,\r\nperused with anxious wonder, was certainly from Effie, although it had no\r\nother signature than the letter E.; and although the orthography, style,\r\nand penmanship, were very far superior not only to anything which Effie\r\ncould produce, who, though a lively girl, had been a remarkably careless\r\nscholar, but even to her more considerate sister\xc3\xads own powers of\r\ncomposition and expression. The manuscript was a fair Italian hand,\r\nthough something stiff and constrained--the spelling and the diction that\r\nof a person who had been accustomed to read good composition, and mix in\r\ngood society.\r\n\r\nThe tenor of the letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Dearest Sister,--At many risks I venture to write to you, to inform\r\nyou that I am still alive, and, as to worldly situation, that I rank\r\nhigher than I could expect or merit. If wealth, and distinction, and an\r\nhonourable rank, could make a woman happy, I have them all; but you,\r\nJeanie, whom the world might think placed far beneath me in all these\r\nrespects, are far happier than I am. I have had means of hearing of your\r\nwelfare, my dearest Jeanie, from time to time--I think I should have\r\nbroken my heart otherwise. I have learned with great pleasure of your\r\nincreasing family. We have not been worthy of such a blessing; two\r\ninfants have been successively removed, and we are now childless--God\xc3\xads\r\nwill be done! But, if we had a child, it would perhaps divert him from\r\nthe gloomy thoughts which make him terrible to himself and others. Yet do\r\nnot let me frighten you, Jeanie; he continues to be kind, and I am far\r\nbetter off than I deserve. You will wonder at my better scholarship; but\r\nwhen I was abroad, I had the best teachers, and I worked hard, because my\r\nprogress pleased him. He is kind, Jeanie, only he has much to distress\r\nhim, especially when he looks backward. When I look backward myself, I\r\nhave always a ray of comfort: it is in the generous conduct of a sister,\r\nwho forsook me not when I was forsaken by every one. You have had your\r\nreward. You live happy in the esteem and love of all who know you, and I\r\ndrag on the life of a miserable impostor, indebted for the marks of\r\nregard I receive to a tissue of deceit and lies, which the slightest\r\naccident may unravel. He has produced me to his friends, since the estate\r\nopened to him, as a daughter of a Scotchman of rank, banished on account\r\nof the Viscount of Dundee\xc3\xads wars--that is, our Fr\xc3\xads old friend Clavers,\r\nyou know--and he says I was educated in a Scotch convent; indeed, I lived\r\nin such a place long enough to enable me to support the character. But\r\nwhen a countryman approaches me, and begins to talk, as they all do, of\r\nthe various families engaged in Dundee\xc3\xads affair, and to make inquiries\r\ninto my connections, and when I see his eye bent on mine with such an\r\nexpression of agony, my terror brings me to the very risk of detection.\r\nGood-nature and politeness have hitherto saved me, as they prevented\r\npeople from pressing on me with distressing questions. But how long--O\r\nhow long, will this be the case!--And if I bring this disgrace on him, he\r\nwill hate me--he will kill me, for as much as he loves me; he is as\r\njealous of his family honour now, as ever he was careless about it. I\r\nhave been in England four months, and have often thought of writing to\r\nyou; and yet, such are the dangers that might arise from an intercepted\r\nletter, that I have hitherto forborne. But now I am obliged to run the\r\nrisk. Last week I saw your great friend, the D. of A. He came to my box,\r\nand sate by me; and something in the play put him in mind of\r\nyou--Gracious Heaven! he told over your whole London journey to all who\r\nwere in the box, but particularly to the wretched creature who was the\r\noccasion of it all. If he had known--if he could have conceived, beside\r\nwhom he was sitting, and to whom the story was told!--I suffered with\r\ncourage, like an Indian at the stake, while they are rending his fibres\r\nand boring his eyes, and while he smiles applause at each well-imagined\r\ncontrivance of his torturers. It was too much for me at last, Jeanie--I\r\nfainted; and my agony was imputed partly to the heat of the place, and\r\npartly to my extreme sensibility; and, hypocrite all over, I encouraged\r\nboth opinions--anything but discovery! Luckily, _he_ was not there. But\r\nthe incident has more alarms. I am obliged to meet your great man often;\r\nand he seldom sees me without talking of E. D. and J. D., and R. B. and\r\nD. D., as persons in whom my amiable sensibility is interested. My\r\namiable sensibility!!!--And then the cruel tone of light indifference\r\nwith which persons in the fashionable world speak together on the most\r\naffecting subjects! To hear my guilt, my folly, my agony, the foibles and\r\nweaknesses of my friends--even your heroic exertions, Jeanie, spoken of\r\nin the drolling style which is the present tone in fashionable\r\nlife--Scarce all that I formerly endured is equal to this state of\r\nirritation--then it was blows and stabs--now it is pricking to death\r\nwith needles and pins.--He--I mean the D.--goes down next month to spend\r\nthe shooting-season in Scotland--he says, he makes a point of always\r\ndining one day at the Manse--be on your guard, and do not betray\r\nyourself, should he mention me--Yourself, alas! _you_ have nothing to\r\nbetray--nothing to fear; you, the pure, the virtuous, the heroine of\r\nunstained faith, unblemished purity, what can you have to fear from the\r\nworld or its proudest minions? It is E. whose life is once more in your\r\nhands--it is E. whom you are to save from being plucked of her borrowed\r\nplumes, discovered, branded, and trodden down, first by him, perhaps,\r\nwho has raised her to this dizzy pinnacle!--The enclosure will reach you\r\ntwice a-year--do not refuse it--it is out of my own allowance, and may\r\nbe twice as much when you want it. With you it may do good--with me it\r\nnever can.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite to me soon, Jeanie, or I shall remain in the agonising\r\napprehension that this has fallen into wrong hands--Address simply to L.\r\nS., under cover, to the Reverend George Whiterose, in the Minster-Close,\r\nYork. He thinks I correspond with some of my noble Jacobite relations who\r\nare in Scotland. How high-church and jacobitical zeal would burn in his\r\nchecks, if he knew he was the agent, not of Euphemia Setoun, of the\r\nhonourable house of Winton, but of E. D., daughter of a Cameronian\r\ncowfeeder!--Jeanie, I can laugh yet sometimes--but God protect you from\r\nsuch mirth.--My father--I mean your father, would say it was like the\r\nidle crackling of thorns; but the thorns keep their poignancy, they\r\nremain unconsumed. Farewell, my dearest Jeanie--Do not show this even to\r\nMr. Butler, much less to any one else. I have every respect for him, but\r\nhis principles are over strict, and my case will not endure severe\r\nhandling.--I rest your affectionate sister, E.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this long letter there was much to surprise as well as to distress\r\nMrs. Butler. That Effie--her sister Effie, should be mingling freely in\r\nsociety, and apparently on not unequal terms, with the Duke of Argyle,\r\nsounded like something so extraordinary, that she even doubted if she\r\nread truly. Not was it less marvellous, that, in the space of four years,\r\nher education should have made such progress. Jeanie\xc3\xads humility readily\r\nallowed that Effie had always, when she chose it, been smarter at her\r\nbook than she herself was, but then she was very idle, and, upon the\r\nwhole, had made much less proficiency. Love, or fear, or necessity,\r\nhowever, had proved an able school-mistress, and completely supplied all\r\nher deficiencies.\r\n\r\nWhat Jeanie least liked in the tone of the letter, was a smothered degree\r\nof egotism. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should have heard little about her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie to\r\nherself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that she was feared the Duke might come to learn wha she\r\nwas, and a\xc3\xad about her puir friends here; but Effie, puir thing, aye looks\r\nher ain way, and folk that do that think mair o\xc3\xad themselves than of their\r\nneighbours.--I am no clear about keeping her siller,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, taking\r\nup a L50 note which had fallen out of the paper to the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe hae\r\neneugh, and it looks unco like theftboot, or hushmoney, as they ca\xc3\xad it;\r\nshe might hae been sure that I wad say naething wad harm her, for a\xc3\xad the\r\ngowd in Lunnon. And I maun tell the minister about it. I dinna see that\r\nshe suld be sae feared for her ain bonny bargain o\xc3\xad a gudeman, and that I\r\nshouldna reverence Mr. Butler just as much; and sae I\xc3\xadll e\xc3\xaden tell him,\r\nwhen that tippling body the Captain has ta\xc3\xaden boat in the morning.--But I\r\nwonder at my ain state of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning back, after she had\r\nmade a step or two to the door to join the gentlemen; \xe2\x80\x9csurely I am no sic\r\na fule as to be angry that Effie\xc3\xads a braw lady, while I am only a\r\nminister\xc3\xads wife?--and yet I am as petted as a bairn, when I should bless\r\nGod, that has redeemed her from shame, and poverty, and guilt, as ower\r\nlikely she might hae been plunged into.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSitting down upon a stool at the foot of the bed, she folded her arms\r\nupon her bosom, saying within herself, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom this place will I not rise\r\ntill I am in a better frame of mind;\xe2\x80\x9d and so placed, by dint of tearing\r\nthe veil from the motives of her little temporary spleen against her\r\nsister, she compelled herself to be ashamed of them, and to view as\r\nblessings the advantages of her sister\xc3\xads lot, while its embarrassments\r\nwere the necessary consequences of errors long since committed. And thus\r\nshe fairly vanquished the feeling of pique which she naturally enough\r\nentertained, at seeing Effie, so long the object of her care and her\r\npity, soar suddenly so high above her in life, as to reckon amongst the\r\nchief objects of her apprehension the risk of their relationship being\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nWhen this unwonted burst of _amour propre_ was thoroughly subdued, she\r\nwalked down to the little parlour where the gentlemen were finishing\r\ntheir game, and heard from the Captain a confirmation of the news\r\nintimated in her letter, that the Duke of Argyle was shortly expected at\r\nRoseneath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xadll find plenty of moor-fowls and plack-cock on the moors of\r\nAuchingower, and he\xc3\xadll pe nae doubt for taking a late dinner, and a ped\r\nat the Manse, as he has done pefore now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a gude right, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeil ane potter to ony ped in the kintra,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd ye\r\nhad potter tell your father, puir body, to get his beasts a\xc3\xad in order,\r\nand put his tamn\xc3\xadd Cameronian nonsense out o\xc3\xad his head for twa or three\r\ndays, if he can pe so opliging; for fan I speak to him apout prute\r\npestil, he answers me out o\xc3\xad the Pible, whilk is not using a shentleman\r\nweel, unless it be a person of your cloth, Mr. Putler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one understood better than Jeanie the merit of the soft answer, which\r\nturneth away wrath; and she only smiled, and hoped that his Grace would\r\nfind everything that was under her father\xc3\xads care to his entire\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut the Captain, who had lost the whole postage of the letter at\r\nbackgammon, was in the pouting mood not unusual to losers, and which,\r\nsays the proverb, must be allowed to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Master Putler, though you know I never meddle with the things of\r\nyour kirk-sessions, yet I must pe allowed to say that I will not be\r\npleased to allow Ailie MacClure of Deepheugh to be poonished as a witch,\r\nin respect she only spaes fortunes, and does not lame, or plind, or\r\npedevil any persons, or coup cadger\xc3\xads carts, or ony sort of mischief; put\r\nonly tells people good fortunes, as anent our poats killing so many seals\r\nand doug-fishes, whilk is very pleasant to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cis, I believe, no witch, but a cheat: and it\r\nis only on that head that she is summoned to the kirk-session, to cause\r\nher to desist in future from practising her impostures upon ignorant\r\npersons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the gracious Duncan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat her practices or\r\npostures are, but I pelieve that if the poys take hould on her to duck\r\nher in the Clachan purn, it will be a very sorry practice--and I pelieve,\r\nmoreover, that if I come in thirdsman among you at the kirk-sessions, you\r\nwill be all in a tamn\xc3\xadd pad posture indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout noticing this threat, Mr. Butler replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat he had not\r\nattended to the risk of ill-usage which the poor woman might undergo at\r\nthe hands of the rabble, and that he would give her the necessary\r\nadmonition in private, instead of bringing her before the assembled\r\nsession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d Duncan said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas speaking like a reasonable shentleman;\xe2\x80\x9d and so\r\nthe evening passed peaceably off.\r\n\r\nNext morning, after the Captain had swallowed his morning draught of\r\nAthole brose, and departed in his coach and six, Mrs. Butler anew\r\ndeliberated upon communicating to her husband her sister\xc3\xads letter. But\r\nshe was deterred by the recollection, that, in doing so, she would unveil\r\nto him the whole of a dreadful secret, of which, perhaps, his public\r\ncharacter might render him an unfit depositary. Butler already had reason\r\nto believe that Effie had eloped with that same Robertson who had been a\r\nleader in the Porteous mob, and who lay under sentence of death for the\r\nrobbery at Kirkcaldy. But he did not know his identity with George\r\nStaunton, a man of birth and fortune, who had now apparently reassumed\r\nhis natural rank in society. Jeanie had respected Staunton\xc3\xads own\r\nconfession as sacred, and upon reflection she considered the letter of\r\nher sisteras equally so, and resolved to mention the contents to no one.\r\n\r\nOn reperusing the letter, she could not help observing the staggering and\r\nunsatisfactory condition of those who have risen to distinction by undue\r\npaths, and the outworks and bulwarks of fiction and falsehood, by which\r\nthey are under the necessity of surrounding and defending their\r\nprecarious advantages. But she was not called upon, she thought, to\r\nunveil her sister\xc3\xads original history--it would restore no right to any\r\none, for she was usurping none--it would only destroy her happiness, and\r\ndegrade her in the public estimation. Had she been wise, Jeanie thought\r\nshe would have chosen seclusion and privacy, in place of public life and\r\ngaiety; but the power of choice might not be hers. The money, she\r\nthought, could not be returned without her seeming haughty and unkind.\r\nShe resolved, therefore, upon reconsidering this point, to employ it as\r\noccasion should serve, either in educating her children better than her\r\nown means could compass, or for their future portion. Her sister had\r\nenough, was strongly bound to assist Jeanie by any means in her power,\r\nand the arrangement was so natural and proper, that it ought not to be\r\ndeclined out of fastidious or romantic delicacy. Jeanie accordingly wrote\r\nto her sister, acknowledging her letter, and requesting to hear from her\r\nas often as she could. In entering into her own little details of news,\r\nchiefly respecting domestic affairs, she experienced a singular\r\nvacillation of ideas; for sometimes she apologised for mentioning things\r\nunworthy the notice of a lady of rank, and then recollected that\r\neverything which concerned her should be interesting to Effie. Her\r\nletter, under the cover of Mr. Whiterose, she committed to the\r\npost-office at Glasgow, by the intervention of a parishioner who had\r\nbusiness at that city.\r\n\r\nThe next week brought the Duke to Roseneath, and shortly afterwards he\r\nintimated his intention of sporting in their neighbourhood, and taking\r\nhis bed at the Manse; an honour which he had once or twice done to its\r\ninmates on former occasions.\r\n\r\nEffie proved to be perfectly right in her auticipations. The Duke had\r\nhardly set himself down at Mrs. Butler\xc3\xads right hand, and taken upon\r\nhimself the task of carving the excellent \xe2\x80\x9cbarn-door chucky,\xe2\x80\x9d which had\r\nbeen selected as the high dishes upon this honourable occasion, before he\r\nbegan to speak of Lady Staunton of Willingham, in Lincolnshire, and the\r\ngreat noise which her wit and beauty made in London. For much of this\r\nJeanie was, in some measure, prepared--but Effie\xc3\xads wit! that would never\r\nhave entered into her imagination, being ignorant how exactly raillery in\r\nthe higher rank resembles flippancy among their inferiors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been the ruling belle--the blazing star--the universal toast of\r\nthe winter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cand is really the most beautiful creature\r\nthat was seen at court upon the birth-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe birthday! and at court!--Jeanie was annihilated, remembering well her\r\nown presentation, all its extraordinary circumstances, and particularly\r\nthe cause of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mention this lady particularly to you, Mrs. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause she has something in the sound of her voice, and cast of her\r\ncountenance, that reminded me of you--not when you look so pale\r\nthough--you have over-fatigued yourself--you must pledge me in a glass\r\nof wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did so, and Butler observed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was dangerous flattery in his Grace\r\nto tell a poor minister\xc3\xads wife that she was like a court-beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke, \xe2\x80\x9cI find you are growing jealous; but\r\nit\xc3\xads rather too late in the day, for you know how long I have admired\r\nyour wife. But seriously, there is betwixt them one of those inexplicable\r\nlikenesses which we see in countenances, that do not otherwise resemble\r\neach other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe perilous part of the compliment has flown off,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mr. Butler.\r\n\r\nHis wife, feeling the awkwardness of silence, forced herself to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, perhaps, the lady might be her countrywoman, and the language\r\nmight have made some resemblance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a Scotch-woman, and\r\nspeaks with a Scotch accent, and now and then a provincial word drops out\r\nso prettily, that it is quite Doric, Mr. Butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clergyman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat would have sounded\r\nvulgar in the great city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must suppose it is not the broad\r\ncoarse Scotch that is spoken in the Cowgate of Edinburgh, or in the\r\nGorbals. This lady has been very little in Scotland, in fact she was\r\neducated in a convent abroad, and speaks that pure court-Scotch, which\r\nwas common in my younger days; but it is so generally disused now, that\r\nit sounds like a different dialect, entirely distinct from our modern\r\n_patois._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding her anxiety, Jeanie could not help admiring within\r\nherself, how the most correct judges of life and manners can be imposed\r\non by their own preconceptions, while the Duke proceeded thus: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is of\r\nthe unfortunate house of Winton, I believe; but, being bred abroad, she\r\nhad missed the opportunity of learning her own pedigree, and was obliged\r\nto me for informing her, that she must certainly come of the Setons of\r\nWindygoul. I wish you could have seen how prettily she blushed at her own\r\nignorance. Amidst her noble and elegant manners, there is now and then a\r\nlittle touch of bashfulness and conventual rusticity, if I may call it\r\nso, that makes her quite enchanting. You see at once the rose that had\r\nbloomed untouched amid the chaste precincts of the cloister, Mr. Butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrue to the hint, Mr. Butler failed not to start with his\r\n\r\n           \xe2\x80\x9cUt flos in septis secretus nascitur hortis,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.,\r\n\r\nwhile his wife could hardly persuade herself that all this was spoken of\r\nEffie Deans, and by so competent a judge as the Duke of Argyle; and had\r\nshe been acquainted with Catullus, would have thought the fortunes of her\r\nsister had reversed the whole passage.\r\n\r\nShe was, however, determined to obtain some indemnification for the\r\nanxious feelings of the moment, by gaining all the intelligence she\r\ncould; and therefore ventured to make some inquiry about the husband of\r\nthe lady his Grace admired so much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very rich,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cof an ancient family, and has good\r\nmanners: but he is far from being such a general favourite as his wife.\r\nSome people say he can be very pleasant--I never saw him so; but should\r\nrather judge him reserved, and gloomy, and capricious. He was very wild\r\nin his youth, they say, and has bad health; yet he is a good-looking man\r\nenough--a great friend of your Lord High Commissioner of the Kirk, Mr.\r\nButler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he is the friend of a very worthy and honourable nobleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nButler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he admire his lady as much as other people do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho--Sir George? They say he is very fond of her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nobserve she trembles a little when he fixes his eye on her, and that is\r\nno good sign--But it is strange how I am haunted by this resemblance of\r\nyours to Lady Staunton, in look and tone of voice. One would almost swear\r\nyou were sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie\xc3\xads distress became uncontrollable, and beyond concealment. The Duke\r\nof Argyle was much disturbed, good-naturedly ascribing it to his having\r\nunwittingly recalled, to her remembrance her family misfortunes. He was\r\ntoo well-bred to attempt to apologise; but hastened to change the\r\nsubject, and arrange certain points of dispute which had occurred betwixt\r\nDuncan of Knock and the minister, acknowledging that his worthy\r\nsubstitute was sometimes a little too obstinate, as well as too\r\nenergetic, in his executive measures.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler admitted his general merits; but said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe would presume to\r\napply to the worthy gentleman the words of the poet to Marrucinus\r\nAsinius,\r\n\r\n                 Manu\r\n                 Non belle uteris in joco atque vino.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe discourse being thus turned on parish business, nothing farther\r\noccurred that can interest the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIFTH.\r\n\r\n              Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,\r\n                 And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\r\n              Thence to be wrench\xc3\xadd by an unlineal hand,\r\n                 No son of mine succeeding.\r\n                                        Macbeth.\r\n\r\nAfter this period, but under the most strict precautions against\r\ndiscovery, the sisters corresponded occasionally, exchanging letters\r\nabout twice every year. Those of Lady Staunton spoke of her husband\xc3\xads\r\nhealth and spirits as being deplorably uncertain; her own seemed also to\r\nbe sinking, and one of the topics on which she most frequently dwelt was\r\ntheir want of family. Sir George Staunton, always violent, had taken some\r\naversion at the next heir, whom he suspected of having irritated his\r\nfriends against him during his absence; and he declared, he would\r\nbequeath Willingham and all its lands to an hospital, ere that\r\nfetch-and-carry tell-tale should inherit an acre of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad he but a child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unfortunate wife, \xe2\x80\x9cor had that luckless\r\ninfant survived, it would be some motive for living and for exertion. But\r\nHeaven has denied us a blessing which we have not deserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch complaints, in varied form, but turning frequently on the same\r\ntopic, filled the letters which passed from the spacious but melancholy\r\nhalls of Willingham, to the quiet and happy parsonage at Knocktarlitie.\r\nYears meanwhile rolled on amid these fruitless repinings. John, Duke of\r\nArgyle and Greenwich, died in the year 1743, universally lamented, but by\r\nnone more than by the Butlers, to whom his benevolence had been so\r\ndistinguished. He was succeeded by his brother Duke Archibald, with whom\r\nthey had not the same intimacy; but who continued the protection which\r\nhis brother had extended towards them. This, indeed, became more\r\nnecessary than ever; for, after the breaking out and suppression of the\r\nrebellion in 1745, the peace of the country, adjacent to the Highlands,\r\nwas considerably disturbed. Marauders, or men that had been driven to\r\nthat desperate mode of life, quartered themselves in the fastnesses\r\nnearest to the Lowlands, which were their scene of plunder; and there is\r\nscarce a glen in the romantic and now peaceable Highlands of Perth,\r\nStirling, and Dumbartonshire, where one or more did not take up their\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nThe prime pest of the parish of Knocktarlitie was a certain Donacha dhu\r\nna Dunaigh, or Black Duncan the Mischievous, whom we have already\r\ncasually mentioned. This fellow had been originally a tinkler, or\r\n_caird,_ many of whom stroll about these districts; but when all police\r\nwas disorganised by the civil war, he threw up his profession, and from\r\nhalf thief became whole robber; and being generally at the head of three\r\nor four active young fellows, and he himself artful, bold, and well\r\nacquainted with the passes, he plied his new profession with emolument to\r\nhimself, and infinite plague to the country.\r\n\r\nAll were convinced that Duncan of Knock could have put down his namesake\r\nDonacha any morning he had a mind; for there were in the parish a set of\r\nstout young men, who had joined Argyle\xc3\xads banner in the war under his old\r\nfriend, and behaved very well on several occasions. And as for their\r\nleader, as no one doubted his courage, it was generally supposed that\r\nDonacha had found out the mode of conciliating his favour, a thing not\r\nvery uncommon in that age and country. This was the more readily\r\nbelieved, as David Deans\xc3\xads cattle (being the property of the Duke) were\r\nleft untouched, when the minister\xc3\xads cows were carried off by the thieves.\r\nAnother attempt was made to renew the same act of rapine, and the cattle\r\nwere in the act of being driven off, when Butler, laying his profession\r\naside in a case of such necessity, put himself at the head of some of his\r\nneighbours, and rescued the creagh, an exploit at which Deans attended in\r\nperson, notwithstanding his extreme old age, mounted on a Highland pony,\r\nand girded with an old broadsword, likening himself (for he failed not to\r\narrogate the whole merit of the expedition) to David, the son of Jesse,\r\nwhen he recovered the spoil of Ziklag from the Amalekites. This spirited\r\nbehaviour had so far a good effect, that Donacha dhu na Dunaigh kept his\r\ndistance for some time to come; and, though his distant exploits were\r\nfrequently spoken of, he did not exercise any depredations in that part\r\nof the country. He continued to flourish, and to be heard of\r\noccasionally, until the year 1751, when, if the fear of the second David\r\nhad kept him in check, fate released him from that restraint, for the\r\nvenerable patriarch of St. Leonard\xc3\xads was that year gathered to his\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\nDavid Deans died full of years and of honour. He is believed, for the\r\nexact time of his birth is not known, to have lived upwards of ninety\r\nyears; for he used to speak of events as falling under his own knowledge,\r\nwhich happened about the time of the battle of Bothwell Bridge. It was\r\nsaid that he even bore arms there; for once, when a drunken Jacobite\r\nlaird wished for a Bothwell Brigg whig, that \xe2\x80\x9che might stow the lugs out\r\nof his head,\xe2\x80\x9d David informed him with a peculiar austerity of\r\ncountenance, that, if he liked to try such a prank, there was one at his\r\nelbow; and it required the interference of Butler to preserve the peace.\r\n\r\nHe expired in the arms of his beloved daughter, thankful for all the\r\nblessings which Providence had vouchsafed to him while in this valley of\r\nstrife and toil--and thankful also for the trials he had been visited\r\nwith; having found them, he said, needful to mortify that spiritual pride\r\nand confidence in his own gifts, which was the side on which the wily\r\nEnemy did most sorely beset him. He prayed in the most affecting manner\r\nfor Jeanie, her husband, and her family, and that her affectionate duty\r\nto the puir auld man might purchase her length of days here, and\r\nhappiness hereafter; then, in a pathetic petition, too well understood by\r\nthose who knew his family circumstances, he besought the Shepherd of\r\nsouls, while gathering his flock, not to forget the little one that had\r\nstrayed from the fold, and even then might be in the hands of the\r\nravening wolf.--He prayed for the national Jerusalem, that peace might be\r\nin her land, and prosperity in her palaces--for the welfare of the\r\nhonourable House of Argyle, and for the conversion of Duncan of\r\nKnockdunder. After this he was silent, being exhausted, nor did he again\r\nutter anything distinctly. He was heard, indeed, to mutter something\r\nabout national defections, right-hand extremes, and left-hand failings\r\noff; but, as May Hettly observed, his head was carried at the time; and\r\nit is probable that these expressions occurred to him merely out of\r\ngeneral habit, and that he died in the full spirit of charity with all\r\nmen. About an hour afterwards he slept in the Lord.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding her father\xc3\xads advanced age, his death was a severe shock\r\nto Mrs. Butler. Much of her time had been dedicated to attending to his\r\nhealth and his wishes, and she felt as if part of her business in the\r\nworld was ended, when the good old man was no more. His wealth, which\r\ncame nearly to fifteen hundred pounds, in disposable capital, served to\r\nraise the fortunes of the family at the Manse. How to dispose of this sum\r\nfor the best advantage of his family, was matter of anxious consideration\r\nto Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we put it on heritable bond, we shall maybe lose the\r\ninterest; for there\xc3\xads that bond over Lounsbeck\xc3\xads land, your father could\r\nneither get principal nor interest for it--If we bring it into the funds,\r\nwe shall maybe lose the principal and all, as many did in the South Sea\r\nscheme. The little estate of Craigsture is in the market--it lies within\r\ntwo miles of the Manse, and Knock says his Grace has no thought to buy\r\nit. But they ask L2500, and they may, for it is worth the money; and were\r\nI to borrow the balance, the creditor might call it up suddenly, or in\r\ncase of my death my family might be distressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so if we had mair siller, we might buy that bonny pasture-ground,\r\nwhere the grass comes so early?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jeanie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my dear; and Knockdunder, who is a good judge, is strongly\r\nadvising me to it. To be sure it is his nephew that is selling it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAweel, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cye maun just look up a text in Scripture,\r\nas ye did when ye wanted siller before--just look up a text in the\r\nBible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Jeanie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, laughing and pressing her hand at the same\r\ntime, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best people in these times can only work miracles once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie composedly; and going to the closet in which\r\nshe kept her honey, her sugar, her pots of jelly, her vials of the more\r\nordinary medicines, and which served her, in short, as a sort of\r\nstore-room, she jangled vials and gallipots, till, from out the darkest\r\nnook, well flanked by a triple row of bottles and jars, which she was\r\nunder the necessity of displacing, she brought a cracked brown cann, with\r\na piece of leather tied over the top. Its contents seemed to be written\r\npapers, thrust in disorder into this uncommon _secre\xc3\xadtaire._ But from\r\namong these Jeanie brought an old clasped Bible, which had been David\r\nDeans\xc3\xads companion in his earlier wanderings, and which he had given to\r\nhis daughter when the failure of his eyes had compelled him to use one of\r\na larger print. This she gave to Butler, who had been looking at her\r\nmotions with some surprise, and desired him to see what that book could\r\ndo for him. He opened the clasps, and to his astonishment a parcel of L50\r\nbank-notes dropped out from betwixt the leaves, where they had been\r\nseparately lodged, and fluttered upon the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cI didna think to hae\r\ntauld you o\xc3\xad my wealth, Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, smiling at his surprise,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctill on my deathbed, or maybe on some family pinch; but it wad be better\r\nlaid out on yon bonny grass-holms, than lying useless here in this auld\r\npigg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow on earth came ye by that siller, Jeanie?--Why, here is more than a\r\nthousand pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, lifting up and counting the notes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were ten thousand, it\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad honestly come by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ntroth I kenna how muckle there is o\xc3\xadt, but it\xc3\xads a\xc3\xad there that ever I\r\ngot.--And as for how I came by it, Reuben--it\xc3\xads weel come by, and\r\nhonestly, as I said before--And it\xc3\xads mair folk\xc3\xads secret than mine, or ye\r\nwad hae kend about it lang syne; and as for onything else, I am not free\r\nto answer mair questions about it, and ye maun just ask me nane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me but one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it all freely and indisputably your\r\nown property, to dispose of it as you think fit?--Is it possible no one\r\nhas a claim in so large a sum except you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _was_ mine, free to dispose of it as I like,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jeanie; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nhave disposed of it already, for now it is yours, Reuben--You are Bible\r\nButler now, as well as your forbear, that my puir father had sic an ill\r\nwill at. Only, if ye like, I wad wish Femie to get a gude share o\xc3\xadt when\r\nwe are gane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, it shall be as you choose--But who on earth ever pitched on\r\nsuch a hiding-place for temporal treasures?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is just ane o\xc3\xad my auld-fashioned gates, as you ca\xc3\xad them, Reuben. I\r\nthought if Donacha Dhu was to make an outbreak upon us, the Bible was the\r\nlast thing in the house he wad meddle wi\xc3\xad--but an ony mair siller should\r\ndrap in, as it is not unlikely, I shall e\xc3\xaden pay it ower to you, and ye\r\nmay lay it out your ain way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I positively must not ask you how you have come by all this money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the clergyman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Reuben, you must not; for if you were asking me very sair I wad\r\nmaybe tell you, and then I am sure I would do wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cis it anything that distresses your own\r\nmind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is baith weal and woe come aye wi\xc3\xad world\xc3\xads gear, Reuben; but ye\r\nmaun ask me naething mair--This siller binds me to naething, and can\r\nnever be speered back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Butler, when he had again counted over the money, as\r\nif to assure himself that the notes were real, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was never man in\r\nthe world had a wife like mine--a blessing seems to follow her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9csince the enchanted princess in the bairn\xc3\xads fairy\r\ntale, that kamed gold nobles out o\xc3\xad the tae side of her haffit locks, and\r\nDutch dollars out o\xc3\xad the tother. But gang away now, minister, and put by\r\nthe siller, and dinna keep the notes wampishing in your hand that gate,\r\nor I shall wish them in the brown pigg again, for fear we get a black\r\ncast about them--we\xc3\xadre ower near the hills in these times to be thought\r\nto hae siller in the house. And, besides, ye maun gree wi\xc3\xad Knockdunder,\r\nthat has the selling o\xc3\xad the lands; and dinna you be simple and let him\r\nken o\xc3\xad this windfa\xc3\xad, but keep him to the very lowest penny, as if ye had\r\nto borrow siller to make the price up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the last admonition, Jeanie showed distinctly, that, although she did\r\nnot understand how to secure the money which came into her hands\r\notherwise than by saving and hoarding it, yet she had some part of her\r\nfather David\xc3\xads shrewdness, even upon worldly subjects. And Reuben Butler\r\nwas a prudent man, and went and did even as his wife had advised him. The\r\nnews quickly went abroad into the parish that the minister had bought\r\nCraigsture; and some wished him joy, and some \xe2\x80\x9cwere sorry it had gane out\r\nof the auld name.\xe2\x80\x9d However, his clerical brethren, understanding that he\r\nwas under the necessity of going to Edinburgh about the ensuing\r\nWhitsunday, to get together David Deans\xc3\xads cash to make up the\r\npurchase-money of his new acquisition, took the opportunity to name him\r\ntheir delegate to the General Assembly, or Convocation of the Scottish\r\nChurch, which takes place usually in the latter end of the month of May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIXTH.\r\n\r\n              But who is this? what thing of sea or land--\r\n                        Female of sex it seems--\r\n              That so bedeck\xc3\xadd, ornate, and gay,\r\n                        Comes this way sailing?\r\n                                          Milton.\r\n\r\nNot long after the incident of the Bible and the bank-notes, Fortune\r\nshowed that she could surprise Mrs Butler as well as her husband. The\r\nMinister, in order to accomplish the various pieces of business which his\r\nunwonted visit to Edinburgh rendered necessary, had been under the\r\nnecessity of setting out from home in the latter end of the month of\r\nFebruary, concluding justly that he would find the space betwixt his\r\ndeparture and the term of Whitsunday (24th May) short enough for the\r\npurpose of bringing forward those various debtors of old David Deans, out\r\nof whose purses a considerable part of the price of his new purchase was\r\nto be made good.\r\n\r\nJeanie was thus in the unwonted situation of inhabiting a lonely house,\r\nand she felt yet more solitary from the death of the good old man who\r\nused to divide her cares with her husband. Her children were her\r\nprincipal resource, and to them she paid constant attention.\r\n\r\nIt happened a day or two after Butler\xc3\xads departure that, while she was\r\nengaged in some domestic duties, she heard a dispute among the young\r\nfolk, which, being maintained with obstinacy, appeared to call for her\r\ninterference. All came to their natural umpire with their complaints.\r\nFemie, not yet ten years old, charged Davie and Reubie with an attempt to\r\ntake away her book by force; and David and Reuben replied, the elder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it was not a book for Femie to read,\xe2\x80\x9d and Reuben, \xe2\x80\x9cThat it was\r\nabout a bad woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get the book, ye little hempie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ndare ye touch papa\xc3\xads books when he is away?\xe2\x80\x9d But the little lady, holding\r\nfast a sheet of crumpled paper, declared \xe2\x80\x9cIt was nane o\xc3\xad papa\xc3\xads books,\r\nand May Hettly had taken it off the muckle cheese which came from\r\nInverara;\xe2\x80\x9d for, as was very natural to suppose, a friendly intercourse,\r\nwith interchange of mutual civilities, was kept up from time to time\r\nbetween Mrs. Dolly Dutton, now Mrs. MacCorkindale, and her former\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nJeanie took the subject of contention out of the child\xc3\xads hand, to satisfy\r\nherself of the propriety of her studies; but how much was she struck when\r\nshe read upon the title of the broadside-sheet, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Speech,\r\nConfession, and Dying Words of Margaret MacCraw, or Murdockson, executed\r\non Harabee Hill, near Carlisle, the  day of  1737.\xe2\x80\x9d It was, indeed, one\r\nof those papers which Archibald had bought at Longtown, when he\r\nmonopolised the pedlar\xc3\xads stock, which Dolly had thrust into her trunk out\r\nof sheer economy. One or two copies, it seems, had remained in her\r\nrepositories at Inverary, till she chanced to need them in packing a\r\ncheese, which, as a very superior production, was sent, in the way of\r\ncivil challenge, to the dairy at Knocktarlitie.\r\n\r\nThe title of this paper, so strangely fallen into the very hands from\r\nwhich, in well-meant respect to her feelings, it had been so long\r\ndetained, was of itself sufficiently startling; but the narrative itself\r\nwas so interesting, that Jeanie, shaking herself loose from the children,\r\nran upstairs to her own apartment, and bolted the door, to peruse it\r\nwithout interruption.\r\n\r\nThe narrative, which appeared to have been drawn up, or at least\r\ncorrected, by the clergyman who attended this unhappy woman, stated the\r\ncrime for which she suffered to have been \xe2\x80\x9cher active part in that\r\natrocious robbery and murder, committed near two years since near\r\nHaltwhistle, for which the notorious Frank Levitt was committed for trial\r\nat Lancaster assizes. It was supposed the evidence of the accomplice\r\nThomas Tuck, commonly called Tyburn Tom, upon which the woman had been\r\nconvicted, would weigh equally heavy against him; although many were\r\ninclined to think it was Tuck himself who had struck the fatal blow,\r\naccording to the dying statement of Meg Murdockson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a circumstantial account of the crime for which she suffered, there\r\nwas a brief sketch of Margaret\xc3\xads life. It was stated that she was a\r\nScotchwoman by birth, and married a soldier in the Cameronian\r\nregiment--that she long followed the camp, and had doubtless acquired in\r\nfields of battle, and similar scenes, that ferocity and love of plunder\r\nfor which she had been afterwards distinguished--that her husband,\r\nhaving obtained his discharge, became servant to a beneficed clergyman\r\nof high situation and character in Lincolnshire, and that she acquired\r\nthe confidence and esteem of that honourable family. She had lost this\r\nmany years after her husband\xc3\xads death, it was stated, in consequence of\r\nconniving at the irregularities of her daughter with the heir of the\r\nfamily, added to the suspicious circumstances attending the birth of a\r\nchild, which was strongly suspected to have met with foul play, in order\r\nto preserve, if possible, the girl\xc3\xads reputation. After this she had led\r\na wandering life both in England and Scotland, under colour sometimes of\r\ntelling fortunes, sometimes of driving a trade in smuggled wares, but,\r\nin fact, receiving stolen goods, and occasionally actively joining in\r\nthe exploits by which they were obtained. Many of her crimes she had\r\nboasted of after conviction, and there was one circumstance for which\r\nshe seemed to feel a mixture of joy and occasional compunction. When she\r\nwas residing in the suburbs of Edinburgh during the preceding summer, a\r\ngirl, who had been seduced by one of her confederates, was intrusted to\r\nher charge, and in her house delivered of a male infant. Her daughter,\r\nwhose mind was in a state of derangement ever since she had lost her own\r\nchild, according to the criminal\xc3\xads account, carried off the poor girl\xc3\xads\r\ninfant, taking it for her own, of the reality of whose death she at\r\ntimes could not be persuaded.\r\n\r\nMargaret Murdockson stated that she, for some time, believed her daughter\r\nhad actually destroyed the infant in her mad fits, and that she gave the\r\nfather to understand so, but afterwards learned that a female stroller\r\nhad got it from her. She showed some compunction at having separated\r\nmother and child, especially as the mother had nearly suffered death,\r\nbeing condemned, on the Scotch law, for the supposed murder of her\r\ninfant. When it was asked what possible interest she could have had in\r\nexposing the unfortunate girl to suffer for a crime she had not\r\ncommitted, she asked, if they thought she was going to put her own\r\ndaughter into trouble to save another? She did not know what the Scotch\r\nlaw would have done to her for carrying the child away. This answer was\r\nby no means satisfactory to the clergyman, and he discovered, by close\r\nexamination, that she had a deep and revengeful hatred against the young\r\nperson whom she had thus injured. But the paper intimated, that, whatever\r\nbesides she had communicated upon this subject was confided by her in\r\nprivate to the worthy and reverend Archdeacon who had bestowed such\r\nparticular pains in affording her spiritual assistance. The broadside\r\nwent on to intimate, that, after her execution, of which the particulars\r\nwere given, her daughter, the insane person mentioned more than once, and\r\nwho was generally known by the name of Madge Wildfire, had been very\r\nill-used by the populace, under the belief that she was a sorceress, and\r\nan accomplice in her mother\xc3\xads crimes, and had been with difficulty\r\nrescued by the prompt interference of the police.\r\n\r\nSuch (for we omit moral reflections, and all that may seem unnecessary to\r\nthe explanation of our story) was the tenor of the broadside. To Mrs.\r\nButler it contained intelligence of the highest importance, since it\r\nseemed to afford the most unequivocal proof of her sister\xc3\xads innocence\r\nrespecting the crime for which she had so nearly suffered. It is true,\r\nneither she nor her husband, nor even her father, had ever believed her\r\ncapable of touching her infant with an unkind hand when in possession of\r\nher reason; but there was a darkness on the subject, and what might have\r\nhappened in a moment of insanity was dreadful to think upon. Besides,\r\nwhatever was their own conviction, they had no means of establishing\r\nEffie\xc3\xads innocence to the world, which, according to the tenor of this\r\nfugitive publication, was now at length completely manifested by the\r\ndying confession of the person chiefly interested in concealing it.\r\n\r\nAfter thanking God for a discovery so dear to her feelings, Mrs. Butler\r\nbegan to consider what use she should make of it. To have shown it to her\r\nhusband would have been her first impulse; but, besides that he was\r\nabsent from home, and the matter too delicate to be the subject of\r\ncorrespondence by an indifferent penwoman, Mrs. Butler recollected that\r\nhe was not possessed of the information necessary to form a judgment upon\r\nthe occasion; and that, adhering to the rule which she had considered as\r\nmost advisable, she had best transmit the information immediately to her\r\nsister, and leave her to adjust with her husband the mode in which they\r\nshould avail themselves of it. Accordingly, she despatched a special\r\nmessenger to Glasgow with a packet, enclosing the Confession of Margaret\r\nMurdockson, addressed, as usual, under cover, to Mr. Whiterose of York.\r\nShe expected, with anxiety, an answer, but none arrived in the usual\r\ncourse of post, and she was left to imagine how many various causes might\r\naccount for Lady Staunton\xc3\xads silence. She began to be half sorry that she\r\nhad parted with the printed paper, both for fear of its having fallen\r\ninto bad hands, and from the desire of regaining the document which might\r\nbe essential to establish her sister\xc3\xads innocence. She was even doubting\r\nwhether she had not better commit the whole matter to her husband\xc3\xads\r\nconsideration, when other incidents occurred to divert her purpose.\r\n\r\nJeanie (she is a favourite, and we beg her pardon for still using the\r\nfamiliar title) had walked down to the sea-side with her children one\r\nmorning after breakfast, when the boys, whose sight was more\r\ndiscriminating than hers, exclaimed, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Captain\xc3\xads coach and six\r\nwas coming right for the shore, with ladies in it.\xe2\x80\x9d Jeanie instinctively\r\nbent her eyes on the approaching boat, and became soon sensible that\r\nthere were two females in the stern, seated beside the gracious Duncan,\r\nwho acted as pilot. It was a point of politeness to walk towards the\r\nlanding-place, in order to receive them, especially as she saw that the\r\nCaptain of Knockdunder was upon honour and ceremony. His piper was in the\r\nbow of the boat, sending forth music, of which one half sounded the\r\nbetter that the other was drowned by the waves and the breeze. Moreover,\r\nhe himself had his brigadier wig newly frizzed, his bonnet (he had\r\nabjured the cocked-hat) decorated with Saint George\xc3\xads red cross, his\r\nuniform mounted as a captain of militia, the Duke\xc3\xads flag with the boar\xc3\xads\r\nhead displayed--all intimated parade and gala.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Butler approached the landing-place, she observed the Captain\r\nhand the ladies ashore with marks of great attention, and the parties\r\nadvanced towards her, the Captain a few steps before the two ladies, of\r\nwhom the taller and elder leaned on the shoulder of the other, who seemed\r\nto be an attendant or servant.\r\n\r\nAs they met, Duncan, in his best, most important, and deepest tone of\r\nHighland civility, \xe2\x80\x9cpegged leave to introduce to Mrs. Putler,\r\nLady--eh--eh--I hae forgotten your leddyship\xc3\xads name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind my name, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady; \xe2\x80\x9cI trust Mrs. Butler will be at\r\nno loss. The Duke\xc3\xads letter\xe2\x80\x9d--And, as she observed Mrs. Butler look\r\nconfused, she said again to Duncan somethin sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you not send\r\nthe letter last night, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn troth and I didna, and I crave your leddyship\xc3\xads pardon; but you see,\r\nmatam, I thought it would do as weel to-tay, pecause Mrs. Putler is never\r\ntaen out o\xc3\xadsorts--never--and the coach was out fishing--and the gig was\r\ngane to Greenock for a cag of prandy--and--Put here\xc3\xads his Grace\xc3\xads\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, taking it out of his hand; \xe2\x80\x9csince you\r\nhave not found it convenient to do me the favour to send it before me, I\r\nwill deliver it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Butler looked with great attention, and a certain dubious feeling of\r\ndeep interest, on the lady, who thus expressed herself with authority\r\nover the man of authority, and to whose mandates he seemed to submit,\r\nresigning the letter with a \xe2\x80\x9cJust as your leddyship is pleased to order\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady was rather above the middle size, beautifully made, though\r\nsomething _embonpoint,_ with a hand and arm exquisitely formed. Her\r\nmanner was easy, dignified, and commanding, and seemed to evince high\r\nbirth and the habits of elevated society. She wore a travelling dress--a\r\ngrey beaver hat, and a veil of Flanders lace. Two footmen, in rich\r\nliveries, who got out of the barge, and lifted out a trunk and\r\nportmanteau, appeared to belong to her suite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you did not receive the letter, madam, which should have served for\r\nmy introduction--for I presume you are Mrs. Butler--I will not present it\r\nto you till you are so good as to admit me into your house without it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo pe sure, matam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Knockdunder, \xe2\x80\x9cye canna doubt Mrs. Putler will\r\ndo that.--Mrs. Putler, this is Lady--Lady--these tamned Southern names\r\nrin out o\xc3\xad my head like a stane trowling down hill--put I believe she is\r\na Scottish woman porn--the mair our credit--and I presume her leddyship\r\nis of the house of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke of Argyle knows my family very well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, in a\r\ntone which seemed designed to silence Duncan, or, at any rate, which had\r\nthat effect completely.\r\n\r\nThere was something about the whole of this stranger\xc3\xads address, and tone,\r\nand manner, which acted upon Jeanie\xc3\xads feelings like the illusions of a\r\ndream, that tease us with a puzzling approach to reality. Something there\r\nwas of her sister in the gait and manner of the stranger, as well as in\r\nthe sound of her voice, and something also, when, lifting her veil, she\r\nshowed features, to which, changed as they were in expression and\r\ncomplexion, she could not but attach many remembrances.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was turned of thirty certainly; but so well were her\r\npersonal charms assisted by the power of dress, and arrangement of\r\nornament, that she might well have passed for one-and-twenty. And her\r\nbehaviour was so steady and so composed, that, as often as Mrs. Butler\r\nperceived anew some point of resemblance to her unfortunate sister, so\r\noften the sustained self-command and absolute composure of the stranger\r\ndestroyed the ideas which began to arise in her imagination. She led the\r\nway silently towards the Manse, lost in a confusion of reflections, and\r\ntrusting the letter with which she was to be there intrusted, would\r\nafford her satisfactory explanation of what was a most puzzling and\r\nembarrassing scene.\r\n\r\nThe lady maintained in the meanwhile the manners of a stranger of rank.\r\nShe admired the various points of view like one who has studied nature,\r\nand the best representations of art. At length she took notice of the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are two fine young mountaineers--Yours, madam, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeanie replied in the affirmative. The stranger sighed, and sighed once\r\nmore as they were presented to her by name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Femie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cand hold your head up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your daughter\xc3\xads name, madam?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEuphemia, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought the ordinary Scottish contraction of the name had been Effie;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied the stranger, in a tone which went to Jeanie\xc3\xads heart; for in that\r\nsingle word there was more of her sister--more of _lang syne_ ideas--than\r\nin all the reminiscences which her own heart had anticipated, or the\r\nfeatures and manner of the stranger had suggested.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Manse, the lady gave Mrs. Butler the letter which\r\nshe had taken out of the hands of Knockdunder; and as she gave it she\r\npressed her hand, adding aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, madam, you will have the\r\ngoodness to get me a little milk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me a drap of the grey-peard, if you please, Mrs. Putler,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nDuncan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Butler withdrew; but, deputing to May Hettly and to David the supply\r\nof the strangers\xc3\xad wants, she hastened into her own room to read the\r\nletter. The envelope was addressed in the Duke of Argyle\xc3\xads hand, and\r\nrequested Mrs. Butler\xc3\xads attentions and civility to a lady of rank, a\r\nparticular friend of his late brother, Lady Staunton of Willingham, who,\r\nbeing recommended to drink goats\xc3\xad whey by the physicians, was to honour\r\nthe Lodge at Roseneath with her residence, while her husband made a short\r\ntour in Scotland. But within the same cover, which had been given to Lady\r\nStaunton unsealed, was a letter from that lady, intended to prepare her\r\nsister for meeting her, and which, but for the Captain\xc3\xads negligence, she\r\nought to have received on the preceding evening. It stated that the news\r\nin Jeanie\xc3\xads last letter had been so interesting to her husband, that he\r\nwas determined to inquire farther into the confession made at Carlisle,\r\nand the fate of that poor innocent, and that, as he had been in some\r\ndegree successful, she had, by the most earnest entreaties, extorted\r\nrather than obtained his permission, under promise of observing the most\r\nstrict incognito, to spend a week or two with her sister, or in her\r\nneighbourhood, while he was prosecuting researches, to which (though it\r\nappeared to her very vainly) he seemed to attach some hopes of success.\r\n\r\nThere was a postscript, desiring that Jeanie would trust to Lady S. the\r\nmanagement of their intercourse, and be content with assenting to what\r\nshe should propose. After reading and again reading the letter, Mrs.\r\nButler hurried down stairs, divided betwixt the fear of betraying her\r\nsecret, and the desire to throw herself upon her sister\xc3\xads neck. Effie\r\nreceived her with a glance at once affectionate and cautionary, and\r\nimmediately proceeded to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been telling Mr. ------, Captain , this gentleman, Mrs. Butler,\r\nthat if you could accommodate me with an apartment in your house, and a\r\nplace for Ellis to sleep, and for the two men, it would suit me better\r\nthan the Lodge, which his Grace has so kindly placed at my disposal. I am\r\nadvised I should reside as near where the goats feed as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have peen assuring my leddy, Mrs. Putler,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat though\r\nit could not discommode you to receive any of his Grace\xc3\xads visitors or\r\nmine, yet she had mooch petter stay at the Lodge; and for the gaits, the\r\ncreatures can be fetched there, in respect it is mair fitting they suld\r\nwait upon her Leddyship, than she upon the like o\xc3\xad them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means derange the goats for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Staunton; \xe2\x80\x9cI am certain\r\nthe milk must be much better here.\xe2\x80\x9d And this she said with languid\r\nnegligence, as one whose slightest intimation of humour is to bear down\r\nall argument.\r\n\r\nMrs. Butler hastened to intimate, that her house, such as it was, was\r\nheartily at the disposal of Lady Staunton; but the Captain continued to\r\nremonstrate..\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chad written\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will settle all that with his Grace\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there were the things had been sent down frae Glasco\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything necessary might be sent over to the Parsonage--She would beg\r\nthe favour of Mrs. Butler to show her an apartment, and of the Captain to\r\nhave her trunks, etc., sent over from Roseneath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she courtesied off poor Duncan, who departed, saying in his secret\r\nsoul, \xe2\x80\x9cCot tamn her English impudence!--she takes possession of the\r\nminister\xc3\xads house as an it were her ain--and speaks to shentlemens as if\r\nthey were pounden servants, and per tamned to her!--And there\xc3\xads the deer\r\nthat was shot too--but we will send it ower to the Manse, whilk will pe\r\nput civil, seeing I hae prought worthy Mrs. Putler sic a fliskmahoy.\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\nAnd with these kind intentions, he went to the shore to give his orders\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the meeting of the sisters was as affectionate as it was\r\nextraordinary, and each evinced her feelings in the way proper to her\r\ncharacter. Jeanie was so much overcome by wonder, and even by awe, that\r\nher feelings were deep, stunning, and almost overpowering. Effie, on the\r\nother hand, wept, laughed, sobbed, screamed, and clapped her hands for\r\njoy, all in the space of five minutes, giving way at once, and without\r\nreserve, to a natural excessive vivacity of temper, which no one,\r\nhowever, knew better how to restrain under the rules of artificial\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour had passed like a moment in their expressions of mutual\r\naffection, Lady Staunton observed the Captain walking with impatient\r\nsteps below the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThat tiresome Highland fool has returned upon\r\nour hands,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will pray him to grace us with his absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout no! hout no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Butler, in a tone of entreaty; \xe2\x80\x9cye maunna\r\naffront the Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffront?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Staunton; \xe2\x80\x9cnobody is ever affronted at what I do or\r\nsay, my dear. However, I will endure him, since you think it proper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain was accordingly graciously requested by Lady Staunton to\r\nremain during dinner. During this visit his studious and punctilious\r\ncomplaisance towards the lady of rank was happily contrasted by the\r\ncavalier air of civil familiarity in which he indulged towards the\r\nminister\xc3\xads wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not been able to persuade Mrs. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Staunton to the\r\nCaptain, during the interval when Jeanie had left the parlour, \xe2\x80\x9cto let me\r\ntalk of making any recompense for storming her house, and garrisoning it\r\nin the way I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless, matam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cit wad ill pecome Mrs. Putler, wha\r\nis a very decent pody, to make any such sharge to a lady who comes from\r\nmy house, or his Grace\xc3\xads, which is the same thing.--And speaking of\r\ngarrisons, in the year forty-five, I was poot with a garrison of twenty\r\nof my lads in the house of Inver-Garry, whilk had near been unhappily,\r\nfor--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, sir--But I wish I could think of some way of\r\nindemnifying this good lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no need of intemnifying at all--no trouble for her, nothing at all--\r\nSo, peing in the house of Inver-Garry, and the people about it being\r\nuncanny, I doubted the warst, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cif any of these two\r\nlads, these young Butlers, I mean, show any turn for the army?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould not say, indeed, my leddy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Knockdunder--\xe2\x80\x9cSo, I knowing\r\nthe people to pe unchancy, and not to lippen to, and hearing a pibroch in\r\nthe wood, I pegan to pid my lads look to their flints, and then--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Staunton, with the most ruthless disregard to the\r\nnarrative which she mangled by these interruptions, \xe2\x80\x9cif that should be\r\nthe case, it should cost Sir George but the asking a pair of colours for\r\none of them at the War-Office, since we have always supported Government,\r\nand never had occasion to trouble ministers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you please, my leddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, who began to find some savour\r\nin this proposal, \xe2\x80\x9cas I hae a braw weel-grown lad of a nevoy, ca\xc3\xadd Duncan\r\nMacGilligan, that is as pig as paith the Putler pairns putten thegither,\r\nSir George could ask a pair for him at the same time, and it wad pe put\r\nae asking for a\xc3\xad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Staunton only answered this hint with a well-bred stare, which gave\r\nno sort of encouragement.\r\n\r\nJeanie, who now returned, was lost in amazement at the wonderful\r\ndifference betwixt the helpless and despairing girl, whom she had seen\r\nstretched on a flock-bed in a dungeon, expecting a violent and\r\ndisgraceful death, and last as a forlorn exile upon the midnight beach,\r\nwith the elegant, well-bred, beautiful woman before her. The features,\r\nnow that her sister\xc3\xads veil was laid aside, did not appear so extremely\r\ndifferent, as the whole manner, expression, look, and bearing. In outside\r\nshow, Lady Staunton seemed completely a creature too soft and fair for\r\nsorrow to have touched; so much accustomed to have all her whims complied\r\nwith by those around her, that she seemed to expect she should even be\r\nsaved the trouble of forming them; and so totally unacquainted with\r\ncontradiction, that she did not even use the tone of self-will, since to\r\nbreathe a wish was to have it fulfilled. She made no ceremony of ridding\r\nherself of Duncan as soon as the evening approached; but complimented him\r\nout of the house under pretext of fatigue, with the utmost _nonchalance._\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone, her sister could not help expressing her wonder at\r\nthe self-possession with which Lady Staunton sustained her part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you are surprised at it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Staunton composedly; \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nyou, my dear Jeanie, have been truth itself from your cradle upwards; but\r\nyou must remember that I am a liar of fifteen years\xc3\xad standing, and\r\ntherefore must by this time be used to my character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, during the feverish tumult of feelings excited during the two or\r\nthree first days, Mrs. Butler thought her sister\xc3\xads manner was completely\r\ncontradictory of the desponding tone which pervaded her correspondence.\r\nShe was moved to tears, indeed, by the sight of her father\xc3\xads grave,\r\nmarked by a modest stone recording his piety and integrity; but lighter\r\nimpressions and associations had also power over her. She amused herself\r\nwith visiting the dairy, in which she had so long been assistant, and was\r\nso near discovering herself to May Hettly, by betraying her acquaintance\r\nwith the celebrated receipt for Dunlop cheese, that she compared herself\r\nto Bedreddin Hassan, whom the vizier, his father-in-law, discovered by\r\nhis superlative skill in composing cream-tarts with pepper in them. But\r\nwhen the novelty of such avocations ceased to amuse her, she showed to\r\nher sister but too plainly, that the gaudy colouring with which she\r\nveiled her unhappiness afforded as little real comfort, as the gay\r\nuniform of the soldier when it is drawn over his mortal wound. There were\r\nmoods and moments, in which her despondence seemed to exceed even that\r\nwhich she herself had described in her letters, and which too well\r\nconvinced Mrs. Butler how little her sister\xc3\xads lot, which in appearance\r\nwas so brilliant, was in reality to be envied.\r\n\r\nThere was one source, however, from which Lady Staunton derived a pure\r\ndegree of pleasure. Gifted in every particular with a higher degree of\r\nimagination than that of her sister, she was an admirer of the beauties\r\nof nature, a taste which compensates many evils to those who happen to\r\nenjoy it. Here her character of a fine lady stopped short, where she\r\nought to have\r\n\r\n          Scream\xc3\xadd at ilk cleugh, and screech\xc3\xadd at ilka how,\r\n                As loud as she had seen the worrie-cow.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, with the two boys for her guides, she undertook long and\r\nfatiguing walks among the neighbouring mountains, to visit glens, lakes,\r\nwaterfalls, or whatever scenes of natural wonder or beauty lay concealed\r\namong their recesses. It is Wordsworth, I think, who, talking of an old\r\nman under difficulties, remarks, with a singular attention to nature,\r\n\r\n                 Whether it was care that spurr\xc3\xadd him,\r\n                 God only knows; but to the very last,\r\n                 He had the lightest foot in Ennerdale.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, languid, listless, and unhappy, within doors, at\r\ntimes even indicating something which approached near to contempt of the\r\nhomely accommodations of her sister\xc3\xads house, although she instantly\r\nendeavoured, by a thousand kindnesses, to atone for such ebullitions of\r\nspleen, Lady Staunton appeared to feel interest and energy while in the\r\nopen air, and traversing the mountain landscapes in society with the two\r\nboys, whose ears she delighted with stories of what she had seen in other\r\ncountries, and what she had to show them at Willingham Manor. And they,\r\non the other hand, exerted themselves in doing the honours of\r\nDumbartonshire to the lady who seemed so kind, insomuch that there was\r\nscarce a glen in the neighbouring hills to which they did not introduce\r\nher.\r\n\r\nUpon one of these excursions, while Reuben was otherwise employed, David\r\nalone acted as Lady Staunton\xc3\xads guide, and promised to show her a cascade\r\nin the hills, grander and higher than any they had yet visited. It was a\r\nwalk of five long miles, and over rough ground, varied, however, and\r\ncheered, by mountain views, and peeps now of the firth and its islands,\r\nnow of distant lakes, now of rocks and precipices. The scene itself, too,\r\nwhen they reached it, amply rewarded the labour of the walk. A single\r\nshoot carried a considerable stream over the face of a black rock, which\r\ncontrasted strongly in colour with the white foam of the cascade, and, at\r\nthe depth of about twenty feet, another rock intercepted the view of the\r\nbottom of the fall. The water, wheeling out far beneath, swept round the\r\ncrag, which thus bounded their view, and tumbled down the rocky glen in a\r\ntorrent of foam. Those who love nature always desire to penetrate into\r\nits utmost recesses, and Lady Staunton asked David whether there was not\r\nsome mode of gaining a view of the abyss at the foot of the fall. He said\r\nthat he knew a station on a shelf on the farther side of the intercepting\r\nrock, from which the whole waterfall was visible, but that the road to it\r\nwas steep and slippery and dangerous. Bent, however, on gratifying her\r\ncuriosity, she desired him to lead the way; and accordingly he did so\r\nover crag and stone, anxiously pointing out to her the resting-places\r\nwhere she ought to step, for their mode of advancing soon ceased to be\r\nwalking, and became scrambling.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, clinging like sea-birds to the face of the rock, they\r\nwere enabled at length to turn round it, and came full in front of the\r\nfall, which here had a most tremendous aspect, boiling, roaring, and\r\nthundering with unceasing din, into a black cauldron, a hundred feet at\r\nleast below them, which resembled the crater of a volcano. The noise, the\r\ndashing of the waters, which gave an unsteady appearance to all around\r\nthem, the trembling even of the huge crag on which they stood, the\r\nprecariousness of their footing, for there was scarce room for them to\r\nstand on the shelf of rock which they had thus attained, had so powerful\r\nan effect on the senses and imagination of Lady Staunton, that she called\r\nout to David she was falling, and would in fact have dropped from the\r\ncrag had he not caught hold of her. The boy was bold and stout of his\r\nage--still he was but fourteen years old, and as his assistance gave no\r\nconfidence to Lady Staunton, she felt her situation become really\r\nperilous. The chance was, that, in the appalling novelty of the\r\ncircumstances, he might have caught the infection of her panic, in which\r\ncase it is likely that both must have perished. She now screamed with\r\nterror, though without hope of calling any one to her assistance. To her\r\namazement, the scream was answered by a whistle from above, of a tone so\r\nclear and shrill, that it was heard even amid the noise of the waterfall.\r\n\r\nIn this moment of terror and perplexity, a human face, black, and having\r\ngrizzled hair hanging down over the forehead and cheeks, and mixing with\r\nmustaches and a beard of the same colour, and as much matted and tangled,\r\nlooked down on them from a broken part of the rock above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the Enemy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, who had very nearly become incapable of\r\nsupporting Lady Staunton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, inaccessible to supernatural terrors, and\r\nrestored to the presence of mind of which she had been deprived by the\r\ndanger of her situation, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a man--For God\xc3\xads sake, my friend, help\r\nus!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe face glared at them, but made no answer; in a second or two\r\nafterwards, another, that of a young lad, appeared beside the first,\r\nequally swart and begrimed, but having tangled black hair, descending in\r\nelf-locks, which gave an air of wildness and ferocity to the whole\r\nexpression of the countenance. Lady Staunton repeated her entreaties,\r\nclinging to the rock with more energy, as she found that, from the\r\nsuperstitious terror of her guide, he became incapable of supporting her.\r\nHer words were probably drowned in the roar of the falling stream, for,\r\nthough she observed the lips of the young being whom she supplicated move\r\nas he spoke in reply, not a word reached her ear.\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards it appeared he had not mistaken the nature of her\r\nsupplication, which, indeed, was easy to be understood from her situation\r\nand gestures. The younger apparition disappeared, and immediately after\r\nlowered a ladder of twisted osiers, about eight feet in length, and made\r\nsigns to David to hold it fast while the lady ascended. Despair gives\r\ncourage, and finding herself in this fearful predicament, Lady Staunton\r\ndid not hesitate to risk the ascent by the precarious means which this\r\naccommodation afforded; and, carefully assisted by the person who had\r\nthus providentially come to her aid, she reached the summit in safety.\r\nShe did not, however, even look around her until she saw her nephew\r\nlightly and actively follow her examples although there was now no one to\r\nhold the ladder fast. When she saw him safe she looked round, and could\r\nnot help shuddering at the place and company in which she found herself.\r\nThey were on a sort of platform of rock, surrounded on every side by\r\nprecipices, or overhanging cliffs, and which it would have been scarce\r\npossible for any research to have discovered, as it did not seem to be\r\ncommanded by any accessible position. It was partly covered by a huge\r\nfragment of stone, which, having fallen from the cliffs above, had been\r\nintercepted by others in its descent, and jammed so as to serve for a\r\nsloping roof to the farther part of the broad shelf or platform on which\r\nthey stood. A quantity of withered moss and leaves, strewed beneath this\r\nrude and wretched shelter, showed the lairs,--they could not be termed\r\nthe beds,--of those who dwelt in this eyrie, for it deserved no other\r\nname. Of these, two were before Lady Staunton. One, the same who had\r\nafforded such timely assistance, stood upright before them, a tall,\r\nlathy, young savage; his dress a tattered plaid and philabeg, no shoes,\r\nno stockings, no hat or bonnet, the place of the last being supplied by\r\nhis hair, twisted and matted like the _glibbe_ of the ancient wild Irish,\r\nand, like theirs, forming a natural thick-set stout enough to bear off\r\nthe cut of a sword. Yet the eyes of the lad were keen and sparkling; his\r\ngesture free and noble, like that of all savages. He took little notice\r\nof David Butler, but gazed with wonder on Lady Staunton, as a being\r\ndifferent probably in dress, and superior in beauty, to anything he had\r\never beheld. The old man, whose face they had first seen, remained\r\nrecumbent in the same posture as when he had first looked down on them,\r\nonly his face was turned towards them as he lay and looked up with a lazy\r\nand listless apathy, which belied the general expression of his dark and\r\nrugged features. He seemed a very tall man, but was scarce better clad\r\nthan the younger. He had on a loose Lowland greatcoat, and ragged tartan\r\ntrews or pantaloons. All around looked singularly wild and unpropitious.\r\nBeneath the brow of the incumbent rock was a charcoal fire, on which\r\nthere was a still working, with bellows, pincers, hammers, a movable\r\nanvil, and other smith\xc3\xads tools; three guns, with two or three sacks and\r\nbarrels, were disposed against the wall of rock, under shelter of the\r\nsuperincumbent crag; a dirk and two swords, and a Lochaber axe, lay\r\nscattered around the fire, of which the red glare cast a ruddy tinge on\r\nthe precipitous foam and mist of the cascade. The lad, when he had\r\nsatisfied his curiosity with staring at Lady Staunton, fetched an earthen\r\njar and a horn-cup, into which he poured some spirits, apparently hot\r\nfrom the still, and offered them successively to the lady and to the boy.\r\nBoth declined, and the young savage quaffed off the draught, which could\r\nnot amount to less than three ordinary glasses. He then fetched another\r\nladder from the corner of the cavern, if it could be termed so, adjusted\r\nit against the transverse rock, which served as a roof, and made signs\r\nfor the lady to ascend it, while he held it fast below. She did so, and\r\nfound herself on the top of a broad rock, near the brink of the chasm\r\ninto which the brook precipitates itself. She could see the crest of the\r\ntorrent flung loose down the rock, like the mane of a wild horse, but\r\nwithout having any view of the lower platform from which she had\r\nascended.\r\n\r\nDavid was not suffered to mount so easily; the lad, from sport or love of\r\nmischief, shook the ladder a good deal as he ascended, and seemed to\r\nenjoy the terror of young Butler, so that, when they had both come up,\r\nthey looked on each other with no friendly eyes. Neither, however, spoke.\r\nThe young caird, or tinker, or gipsy, with a good deal of attention,\r\nassisted Lady Staunton up a very perilous ascent which she had still to\r\nencounter, and they were followed by David Butler, until all three stood\r\nclear of the ravine on the side of a mountain, whose sides were covered\r\nwith heather and sheets of loose shingle. So narrow was the chasm out of\r\nwhich they ascended, that, unless when they were on the very verge, the\r\neye passed to the other side without perceiving the existence of a rent\r\nso fearful, and nothing was seen of the cataract, though its deep hoarse\r\nvoice was still heard.\r\n\r\nLady Staunton, freed from the danger of rock and river, had now a new\r\nsubject of anxiety. Her two guides confronted each other with angry\r\ncountenances; for David, though younger by two years at least, and much\r\nshorter, was a stout, well-set, and very bold boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the black-coat\xc3\xads son of Knocktarlitie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young caird;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you come here again, I\xc3\xadll pitch you down the linn like a foot-ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, lad, ye are very short to be sae lang,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted young Butler\r\nundauntedly, and measuring his opponent\xc3\xads height with an undismayed eye;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking you are a gillie of Black Donacha; if you come down the\r\nglen, we\xc3\xadll shoot you like a wild buck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may tell your father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lad, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the leaf on the timber is\r\nthe last he shall see--we will hae amends for the mischief he has done to\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he will live to see mony simmers, and do ye muckle mair,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered David.\r\n\r\nMore might have passed, but Lady Staunton stepped between them with her\r\npurse in her hand, and taking out a guinea, of which it contained\r\nseveral, visible through the net-work, as well as some silver in the\r\nopposite end, offered it to the caird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe white siller, lady--the white siller,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young savage, to\r\nwhom the value of gold was probably unknown. Lady Staunton poured what\r\nsilver she had into his hand, and the juvenile savage snatched it\r\ngreedily, and made a sort of half inclination of acknowledgment and\r\nadieu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us make haste now, Lady Staunton,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, \xe2\x80\x9cfor there will be\r\nlittle peace with them since they hae seen your purse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey hurried on as fast as they could; but they had not descended the\r\nhill a hundred yards or two before they heard a halloo behind them, and\r\nlooking back, saw both the old man and the young one pursuing them with\r\ngreat speed, the former with a gun on his shoulder. Very fortunately, at\r\nthis moment a sportsman, a gamekeeper of the Duke, who was engaged in\r\nstalking deer, appeared on the face of the hill. The bandits stopped on\r\nseeing him, and Lady Staunton hastened to put herself under his\r\nprotection. He readily gave them his escort home, and it required his\r\nathletic form and loaded rifle to restore to the lady her usual\r\nconfidence and courage.\r\n\r\nDonald listened with much gravity to the account of their adventure; and\r\nanswered with great composure to David\xc3\xads repeated inquiries, whether he\r\ncould have suspected that the cairds had been lurking there,--\xe2\x80\x9cInteed,\r\nMaster Tavie, I might hae had some guess that they were there, or\r\nthereabout, though maybe I had nane. But I am aften on the hill; and they\r\nare like wasps--they stang only them that fashes them; sae, for my part,\r\nI make a point not to see them, unless I were ordered out on the preceese\r\nerrand by MacCallummore or Knockdunder, whilk is a clean different case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey reached the Manse late; and Lady Staunton, who had suffered much\r\nboth from fright and fatigue, never again permitted her love of the\r\npicturesque to carry her so far among the mountains without a stronger\r\nescort than David, though she acknowledged he had won the stand of\r\ncolours by the intrepidity he had displayed, so soon as assured he had to\r\ndo with an earthly antagonist. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldna maybe hae made muckle o\xc3\xad a\r\nbargain wi\xc3\xad yon lang callant,\xe2\x80\x9d said David, when thus complimented on his\r\nvalour; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when ye deal wi\xc3\xad thae folk, it\xc3\xads tyne heart tyne a\xc3\xad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENTH.\r\n\r\n              What see you there,\r\n              That hath so cowarded and chased your blood\r\n                          Out of appearance?\r\n                                    Henry the Fifth.\r\n\r\nWe are under the necessity of returning to Edinburgh, where the General\r\nAssembly was now sitting. It is well known, that some Scottish nobleman\r\nis usually deputed as High Commissioner, to represent the person of the\r\nKing in this convocation; that he has allowances for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining a certain outward show and solemnity, and supporting the\r\nhospitality of the representative of Majesty. Whoever are distinguished\r\nby rank, or office, in or near the capital, usually attend the morning\r\nlevees of the Lord Commissioner, and walk with him in procession to the\r\nplace where the Assembly meets.\r\n\r\nThe nobleman who held this office chanced to be particularly connected\r\nwith Sir George Staunton, and it was in his train that he ventured to\r\ntread the High Street of Edinburgh for the first time since the fatal\r\nnight of Porteous\xc3\xads execution. Walking at the right hand of the\r\nrepresentative of Sovereignty, covered with lace and embroidery, and with\r\nall the paraphernalia of wealth and rank, the handsome though wasted\r\nfigure of the English stranger attracted all eyes. Who could have\r\nrecognised in a form so aristocratic the plebeian convict, that,\r\ndisguised in the rags of Madge Wildfire, had led the formidable rioters\r\nto their destined revenge? There was no possibility that this could\r\nhappen, even if any of his ancient acquaintances, a race of men whose\r\nlives are so brief, had happened to survive the span commonly allotted to\r\nevil-doers. Besides, the whole affair had long fallen asleep, with the\r\nangry passions in which it originated. Nothing is more certain than that\r\npersons known to have had a share in that formidable riot, and to have\r\nfled from Scotland on that account, had made money abroad, returned to\r\nenjoy it in their native country, and lived and died undisturbed by the\r\nlaw.*\r\n\r\n* See Arnot\xc3\xads _Criminal Trials,_ 4to ed. p. 235.\r\n\r\nThe forbearance of the magistrate was, in these instances, wise,\r\ncertainly, and just; for what good impression could be made on the public\r\nmind by punishment, when the memory of the offence was obliterated, and\r\nall that was remembered was the recent inoffensive, or perhaps exemplary\r\nconduct of the offender?\r\n\r\nSir George Staunton might, therefore, tread the scene of his former\r\naudacious exploits, free from the apprehension of the law, or even of\r\ndiscovery or suspicion. But with what feelings his heart that day\r\nthrobbed, must be left to those of the reader to imagine. It was an\r\nobject of no common interest which had brought him to encounter so many\r\npainful remembrances.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of Jeanie\xc3\xads letter to Lady Staunton, transmitting the\r\nconfession, he had visited the town of Carlisle, and had found Archdeacon\r\nFleming still alive, by whom that confession had been received. This\r\nreverend gentleman, whose character stood deservedly very high, he so far\r\nadmitted into his confidence, as to own himself the father of the\r\nunfortunate infant which had been spirited away by Madge Wildfire,\r\nrepresenting the intrigue as a matter of juvenile extravagance on his own\r\npart, for which he was now anxious to atone, by tracing, if possible,\r\nwhat had become of the child. After some recollection of the\r\ncircumstances, the clergyman was able to call to memory, that the unhappy\r\nwoman had written a letter to George Staunton, Esq., younger, Rectory,\r\nWillingham, by Grantham; that he had forwarded it to the address\r\naccordingly, and that it had been returned, with a note from the Reverend\r\nMr. Staunton, Rector of Willingham, saying, he knew no such person as him\r\nto whom the letter was addressed. As this had happened just at the time\r\nwhen George had, for the last time, absconded from his father\xc3\xads house to\r\ncarry off Effie, he was at no loss to account for the cause of the\r\nresentment, under the influence of which his father had disowned him.\r\nThis was another instance in which his ungovernable temper had occasioned\r\nhis misfortune; had he remained at Willingham but a few days longer, he\r\nwould have received Margaret Murdockson\xc3\xads letter, in which were exactly\r\ndescribed the person and haunts of the woman, Annaple Bailzou, to whom\r\nshe had parted with the infant. It appeared that Meg Murdockson had been\r\ninduced to make this confession, less from any feelings of contrition,\r\nthan from the desire of obtaining, through George Staunton or his\r\nfather\xc3\xads means, protection and support for her daughter Madge. Her letter\r\nto George Staunton said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat while the writer lived, her daughter would\r\nhave needed nought from any body, and that she would never have meddled\r\nin these affairs, except to pay back the ill that George had done to her\r\nand hers. But she was to die, and her daughter would be destitute, and\r\nwithout reason to guide her. She had lived in the world long enough to\r\nknow that people did nothing for nothing;--so she had told George\r\nStaunton all he could wish to know about his wean, in hopes he would not\r\nsee the demented young creature he had ruined perish for want. As for her\r\nmotives for not telling them sooner, she had a long account to reckon for\r\nin the next world, and she would reckon for that too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clergyman said that Meg had died in the same desperate state of mind,\r\noccasionally expressing some regret about the child which was lost, but\r\noftener sorrow that the mother had not been hanged--her mind at once a\r\nchaos of guilt, rage, and apprehension for her daughter\xc3\xads future safety;\r\nthat instinctive feeling of parental anxiety which she had in common with\r\nthe she-wolf and lioness, being the last shade of kindly affection that\r\noccupied a breast equally savage.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy catastrophe of Madge Wildfire was occasioned by her taking\r\nthe confusion of her mother\xc3\xads execution, as affording an opportunity of\r\nleaving the workhouse to which the clergyman had sent her, and presenting\r\nherself to the mob in their fury, to perish in the way we have already\r\nseen. When Dr. Fleming found the convict\xc3\xads letter was returned from\r\nLincolnshire, he wrote to a friend in Edinburgh, to inquire into the fate\r\nof the unfortunate girl whose child had been stolen, and was informed by\r\nhis correspondent, that she had been pardoned, and that, with all her\r\nfamily, she had retired to some distant part of Scotland, or left the\r\nkingdom entirely. And here the matter rested, until, at Sir George\r\nStaunton\xc3\xads application, the clergyman looked out, and produced Margaret\r\nMurdockson\xc3\xads returned letter, and the other memoranda which he had kept\r\nconcerning the affair.\r\n\r\nWhatever might be Sir George Staunton\xc3\xads feelings in ripping up this\r\nmiserable history, and listening to the tragical fate of the unhappy girl\r\nwhom he had ruined, he had so much of his ancient wilfulness of\r\ndisposition left, as to shut his eyes on everything, save the prospect\r\nwhich seemed to open itself of recovering his son. It was true, it would\r\nbe difficult to produce him, without telling much more of the history of\r\nhis birth, and the misfortunes of his parents, than it was prudent to\r\nmake known. But let him once be found, and, being found, let him but\r\nprove worthy of his father\xc3\xads protection, and many ways might be fallen\r\nupon to avoid such risk. Sir George Staunton was at liberty to adopt him\r\nas his heir, if he pleased, without communicating the secret of his\r\nbirth; or an Act of Parliament might be obtained, declaring him\r\nlegitimate, and allowing him the name and arms of his father. He was\r\nindeed already a legitimate child according to the law of Scotland, by\r\nthe subsequent marriage of his parents. Wilful in everything, Sir\r\nGeorge\xc3\xads sole desire now was to see this son, even should his recovery\r\nbring with it a new series of misfortunes, as dreadful as those which\r\nfollowed on his being lost.\r\n\r\nBut where was the youth who might eventually be called to the honours and\r\nestates of this ancient family? On what heath was he wandering, and\r\nshrouded by what mean disguise? Did he gain his precarious bread by some\r\npetty trade, by menial toil, by violence, or by theft? These were\r\nquestions on which Sir George\xc3\xads anxious investigations could obtain no\r\nlight. Many remembered that Annaple Bailzou wandered through the country\r\nas a beggar and fortune-teller, or spae-wife--some remembered that she\r\nhad been seen with an infant in 1737 or 1738,--but for more than ten\r\nyears she had not travelled that district; and that she had been heard to\r\nsay she was going to a distant part of Scotland, of which country she was\r\na native. To Scotland, therefore, came Sir George Staunton, having parted\r\nwith his lady at Glasgow; and his arrival at Edinburg happening to\r\ncoincide with the sitting of the General Assembly of the Kirk, his\r\nacquaintance with the nobleman who held the office of Lord High\r\nCommissioner forced him more into public than suited either his views or\r\ninclinations.\r\n\r\nAt the public table of this nobleman, Sir George Staunton was placed next\r\nto a clergyman of respectable appearance, and well-bred, though plain\r\ndemeanour, whose name he discovered to be Butler. It had been no part of\r\nSir George\xc3\xads plan to take his brother-in-law into his confidence, and he\r\nhad rejoiced exceedingly in the assurances he received from his wife,\r\nthat Mrs. Butler, the very soul of integrity and honour, had never\r\nsuffered the account he had given of himself at Willingham Rectory to\r\ntranspire, even to her husband. But he was not sorry to have an\r\nopportunity to converse with so near a connection without being known to\r\nhim, and to form a judgment of his character and understanding. He saw\r\nmuch, and heard more, to raise Butler very high in his opinion. He found\r\nhe was generally respected by those of his own profession, as well as by\r\nthe laity who had seats in the Assembly. He had made several public\r\nappearances in the Assembly, distinguished by good sense, candour, and\r\nability; and he was followed and admired as a sound, and, at the same\r\ntime, an eloquent preacher.\r\n\r\nThis was all very satisfactory to Sir George Staunton\xc3\xads pride, which had\r\nrevolted at the idea of his wife\xc3\xads sister being obscurely married. He now\r\nbegan, on the contrary, to think the connection so much better than he\r\nexpected, that, if it should be necessary to acknowledge it, in\r\nconsequence of the recovery of his son, it would sound well enough that\r\nLady Staunton had a sister, who, in the decayed state of the family, had\r\nmarried a Scottish clergyman, high in the opinion of his countrymen, and\r\na leader in the church.\r\n\r\nIt was with these feelings, that, when the Lord High Commissioner\xc3\xads\r\ncompany broke up, Sir George Staunton, under pretence of prolonging some\r\ninquiries concerning the constitution of the Church of Scotland,\r\nrequested Butler to go home to his lodgings in the Lawnmarket, and drink\r\na cup of coffee. Butler agreed to wait upon him, providing Sir George\r\nwould permit him, in passing, to call at a friend\xc3\xads house where he\r\nresided, and make his apology for not coming to partake her tea. They\r\nproceeded up the High Street, entered the Krames, and passed the\r\nbegging-box, placed to remind those at liberty of the distresses of the\r\npoor prisoners. Sir George paused there one instant, and next day a L20\r\nnote was found in that receptacle for public charity.\r\n\r\nWhen he came up to Butler again, he found him with his eyes fixed on the\r\nentrance of the Tolbooth, and apparently in deep thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat seems a very strong door,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George, by way of saying\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler, turning off and beginning to walk forward,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut it was my misfortune at one time to see it prove greatly too weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, looking at his companion, he asked him whether he felt\r\nhimself ill? and Sir George Staunton admitted, that he had been so\r\nfoolish as to eat ice, which sometimes disagreed with him. With kind\r\nofficiousness, that would not be gainsaid, and ere he could find out\r\nwhere he was going, Butler hurried Sir George into the friend\xc3\xads house,\r\nnear to the prison, in which he himself had lived since he came to town,\r\nbeing, indeed, no other than that of our old friend Bartoline Saddletree,\r\nin which Lady Staunton had served a short noviciate as a shop-maid. This\r\nrecollection rushed on her husband\xc3\xads mind, and the blush of shame which\r\nit excited overpowered the sensation of fear which had produced his\r\nformer paleness. Good Mrs. Saddletree, however, bustled about to receive\r\nthe rich English baronet as the friend of Mr. Butler, and requested an\r\nelderly female in a black gown to sit still, in a way which seemed to\r\nimply a wish, that she would clear the way for her betters. In the\r\nmeanwhile, understanding the state of the case, she ran to get some\r\ncordial waters, sovereign, of course, in all cases of faintishness\r\nwhatsoever. During her absence, her visitor, the female in black, made\r\nsome progress out of the room, and might have left it altogether without\r\nparticular observation, had she not stumbled at the threshold, so near\r\nSir George Staunton, that he, in point of civility, raised her and\r\nassisted her to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Porteous is turned very doited now, puir body,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nSaddletree, as she returned with her bottle in her hand--\xe2\x80\x9cShe is no sae\r\nauld, but she got a sair back-cast wi\xc3\xad the slaughter o\xc3\xad her husband--Ye\r\nhad some trouble about that job, Mr. Butler.--I think, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d to Sir\r\nGeorge, \xe2\x80\x9cye had better drink out the haill glass, for to my een ye look\r\nwaur than when ye came in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, he grew as pale as a corpse, on recollecting who it was that\r\nhis arm had so lately supported--the widow whom he had so large a share\r\nin making such.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a prescribed job that case of Porteous now,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Saddletree,\r\nwho was confined to his chair by the gout--\xe2\x80\x9cclean prescribed and out of\r\ndate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not clear of that, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Plumdamas, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have heard\r\nthem say twenty years should rin, and this is but the fifty-ane--\r\nPorteous\xc3\xads mob was in thretty-seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xc3\xadll no teach me law, I think, neighbour--me that has four gaun pleas,\r\nand might hae had fourteen, an it hadna been the gudewife? I tell ye, if\r\nthe foremost of the Porteous mob were standing there where that gentleman\r\nstands, the King\xc3\xads Advocate wadna meddle wi\xc3\xad him--it fa\xc3\xads under the\r\nnegative prescription.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaud your din, carles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Saddletree, \xe2\x80\x9cand let the gentleman sit\r\ndown and get a dish of comfortable tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sir George had had quite enough of their conversation; and Butler, at\r\nhis request, made an apology to Mrs. Saddletree, and accompanied him to\r\nhis lodgings. Here they found another guest waiting Sir George Staunton\xc3\xads\r\nreturn. This was no other than our reader\xc3\xads old acquaintance, Ratcliffe.\r\n\r\nThis man had exercised the office of turnkey with so much vigilance,\r\nacuteness, and fidelity, that he gradually rose to be governor, or\r\ncaptain of the Tolbooth. And it is yet to be remembered in tradition,\r\nthat young men, who rather sought amusing than select society in their\r\nmerry-meetings, used sometimes to request Ratcliffe\xc3\xads company, in order\r\nthat he might regale them with legends of his extraordinary feats in the\r\nway of robbery and escape.*\r\n\r\n* There seems an anachronism in the history of this person. Ratcliffe,\r\namong other escapes from justice, was released by the Porteous mob when\r\nunder sentence of death; and he was again under the same predicament,\r\nwhen the Highlanders made a similar jail-delivery in 1745. He was too\r\nsincere a whig to embrace liberation at the hands of the Jacobites, and\r\nin reward was made one of the keepers of the Tolbooth. So at least runs\r\nconstant tradition.\r\n\r\nBut he lived and died without resuming his original vocation, otherwise\r\nthan in his narratives over a bottle.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, he had been recommended to Sir George Staunton\r\nby a man of the law in Edinburgh, as a person likely to answer any\r\nquestions he might have to ask about Annaple Bailzou, who, according to\r\nthe colour which Sir George Staunton gave to his cause of inquiry, was\r\nsupposed to have stolen a child in the west of England, belonging to a\r\nfamily in which he was interested. The gentleman had not mentioned his\r\nname, but only his official title; so that Sir George Staunton, when told\r\nthat the captain of the Tolbooth was waiting for him in his parlour, had\r\nno idea of meeting his former acquaintance, Jem Ratcliffe.\r\n\r\nThis, therefore, was another new and most unpleasant surprise, for he had\r\nno difficulty in recollecting this man\xc3\xads remarkable features. The change,\r\nhowever, from George Robertson to Sir George Staunton, baffled even the\r\npenetration of Ratcliffe, and he bowed very low to the baronet and his\r\nguest, hoping Mr. Butler would excuse his recollecting that he was an old\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd once rendered my wife a piece of great service,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Butler,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor which she sent you a token of grateful acknowledgment, which I hope\r\ncame safe and was welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeil a doubt on\xc3\xadt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, with a knowing nod; \xe2\x80\x9cbut ye are\r\nmuckle changed for the better since I saw ye, Maister Butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much so, that I wonder you knew me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha, then!--Deil a face I see I ever forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe while Sir\r\nGeorge Staunton, tied to the stake, and incapable of escaping, internally\r\ncursed the accuracy of his memory. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nRatcliffe, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sharpest hand will be ta\xc3\xaden in. There is a face in this\r\nvery room, if I might presume to be sae bauld, that, if I didna ken the\r\nhonourable person it belangs to, I might think it had some cut of an auld\r\nacquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not be much flattered,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Baronet, sternly, and\r\nroused by the risk in which he saw himself placed, \xe2\x80\x9cif it is to me you\r\nmean to apply that compliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no manner of means, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ratcliffe, bowing very low; \xe2\x80\x9cI am come\r\nto receive your honour\xc3\xads commands, and no to trouble your honour wi\xc3\xad my\r\npoor observations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George, \xe2\x80\x9cI am told you understand police matters--\r\nSo do I.--To convince you of which, here are ten guineas of retaining\r\nfee--I make them fifty when you can find me certain notice of a person,\r\nliving or dead, whom you will find described in that paper. I shall leave\r\ntown presently--you may send your written answer to me to the care of\r\nMr. ----\xe2\x80\x9d (naming his highly respectable agent), \xe2\x80\x9cor of his Grace the Lord\r\nHigh Commissioner.\xe2\x80\x9d Rateliffe bowed and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have angered the proud peat now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cby finding out\r\na likeness; but if George Robertson\xc3\xads father had lived within a mile of\r\nhis mother, d--n me if I should not know what to think, for as high as he\r\ncarries his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was left alone with Butler, Sir George Staunton ordered tea and\r\ncoffee, which were brought by his valet, and then, after considering with\r\nhimself for a minute, asked his guest whether he had lately heard from\r\nhis wife and family. Butler, with some surprise at the question, replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat he had received no letter for some time; his wife was a poor\r\npenwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the first to inform you there has\r\nbeen an invasion of your quiet premises since you left home. My wife,\r\nwhom the Duke of Argyle had the goodness to permit to use Roseneath\r\nLodge, while she was spending some weeks in your country, has sallied\r\nacross and taken up her quarters in the Manse, as she says, to be nearer\r\nthe goats, whose milk she is using; but, I believe, in reality, because\r\nshe prefers Mrs. Butler\xc3\xads company to that of the respectable gentleman\r\nwho acts as seneschal on the Duke\xc3\xads domains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Butler said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe had often heard the late Duke and the present speak\r\nwith high respect of Lady Staunton, and was happy if his house could\r\naccommodate any friend of theirs--it would be but a very slight\r\nacknowledgment of the many favours he owed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat does not make Lady Staunton and myself the less obliged to your\r\nhospitality, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I inquire if you think of\r\nreturning home soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the course of two days,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Butler answered, \xe2\x80\x9chis duty in the\r\nAssembly would be ended; and the other matters he had in town being all\r\nfinished, he was desirous of returning to Dumbartonshire as soon as he\r\ncould; but he was under the necessity of transporting a considerable sum\r\nin bills and money with him, and therefore wished to travel in company\r\nwith one or two of his brethren of the clergy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy escort will be more safe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think of\r\nsetting off to-morrow or next day. If you will give me the pleasure of\r\nyour company, I will undertake to deliver you and your charge safe at the\r\nManse, provided you will admit me along with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Butler gratefully accepted of this proposal; the appointment was made\r\naccordingly, and, by despatches with one of Sir George\xc3\xads servants, who\r\nwas sent forward for the purpose, the inhabitants of the manse of\r\nKnocktarlitie were made acquainted with the intended journey; and the\r\nnews rung through the whole vicinity, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the minister was coming back\r\nwi\xc3\xad a braw English gentleman and a\xc3\xad the siller that was to pay for the\r\nestate of Craigsture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sudden resolution of going to Knocktarlitie had been adopted by Sir\r\nGeorge Staunton in consequence of the incidents of the evening. In spite\r\nof his present consequence, he felt he had presumed too far in venturing\r\nso near the scene of his former audacious acts of violence, and he knew\r\ntoo well, from past experience, the acuteness of a man like Ratcliffe,\r\nagain to encounter him. The next two days he kept his lodgings, under\r\npretence of indisposition, and took leave by writing of his noble friend\r\nthe High Commissioner, alleging the opportunity of Mr. Butler\xc3\xads company\r\nas a reason for leaving Edinburgh sooner than he had proposed. He had a\r\nlong conference with his agent on the subject of Annaple Bailzou; and the\r\nprofessional gentleman, who was the agent also of the Argyle family, had\r\ndirections to collect all the information which Ratcliffe or others might\r\nbe able to obtain concerning the fate of that woman and the unfortunate\r\nchild, and so soon as anything transpired which had the least appearance\r\nof being important, that he should send an express with it instantly to\r\nKnocktarlitie. These instructions were backed with a deposit of money,\r\nand a request that no expense might be spared; so that Sir George\r\nStaunton had little reason to apprehend negligence on the part of the\r\npersons intrusted with the commission.\r\n\r\nThe journey, which the brothers made in company, was attended with more\r\npleasure, even to Sir George Staunton, than he had ventured to expect.\r\nHis heart lightened in spite of himself when they lost sight of\r\nEdinburgh; and the easy, sensible conversation of Butler was well\r\ncalculated to withdraw his thoughts from painful reflections. He even\r\nbegan to think whether there could be much difficulty in removing his\r\nwife\xc3\xads connections to the rectory of Willingham; it was only on his part\r\nprocuring some still better preferment for the present incumbent, and on\r\nButler\xc3\xads, that he should take orders according to the English Church, to\r\nwhich he could not conceive a possibility of his making objection, and\r\nthen he had them residing under his wing. No doubt there was pain in\r\nseeing Mrs. Butler, acquainted, as he knew her to be, with the full truth\r\nof his evil history; but then her silence, though he had no reason to\r\ncomplain of her indiscretion hitherto, was still more absolutely ensured.\r\nIt would keep his lady, also, both in good temper and in more subjection;\r\nfor she was sometimes troublesome to him by insisting on remaining in\r\ntown when he desired to retire to the country, alleging the total want of\r\nsociety at Willingham. \xe2\x80\x9cMadam, your sister is there,\xe2\x80\x9d would, he thought,\r\nbe a sufficient answer to this ready argument.\r\n\r\nHe sounded Butler on this subject, asking what he would think of an\r\nEnglish living of twelve hundred pounds yearly, with the burden of\r\naffording his company now and then to a neighbour, whose health was not\r\nstrong or his spirits equal. \xe2\x80\x9cHe might meet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9coccasionally, a\r\nvery learned and accomplished gentleman, who was in orders as a Catholic\r\npriest, but he hoped that would be no insurmountable objection to a man\r\nof his liberality of sentiment. What,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould Mr. Butler think\r\nof as an answer, if the offer should be made to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply that I could not accept of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no mind\r\nto enter into the various debates between the churches; but I was brought\r\nup in mine own, have received her ordination, am satisfied of the truth\r\nof her doctrines, and will die under the banner I have enlisted to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat may be the value of your preferment?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George Staunton,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cunless I am asking an indiscreet question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably one hundred a-year, one year with another, besides my glebe and\r\npasture-ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you scruple to exchange that for twelve hundred a-year, without\r\nalleging any damning difference of doctrine betwixt the two churches of\r\nEngland and Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn that, sir, I have reserved my judgment; there may be much good, and\r\nthere are certainly saving means in both; but every man must act\r\naccording to his own lights. I hope I have done, and am in the course of\r\ndoing, my Master\xc3\xads work in this Highland parish; and it would ill become\r\nme, for the sake of lucre, to leave my sheep in the wilderness. But, even\r\nin the temporal view which you have taken of the matter, Sir George, this\r\nhundred pounds a-year of stipend hath fed and clothed us, and left us\r\nnothing to wish for; my father-in-law\xc3\xads succession, and other\r\ncircumstances, have added a small estate of about twice as much more, and\r\nhow we are to dispose of it I do not know--So I leave it to you, sir, to\r\nthink if I were wise, not having the wish or opportunity of spending\r\nthree hundred a-year, to covet the possession of four times that sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is philosophy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George; \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of it, but I never\r\nsaw it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is common sense,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich accords with philosophy and\r\nreligion more frequently than pedants or zealots are apt to admit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir George turned the subject, and did not again resume it. Although they\r\ntravelled in Sir George\xc3\xads chariot, he seemed so much fatigued with the\r\nmotion, that it was necessary for him to remain for a day at a small town\r\ncalled Mid-Calder, which was their first stage from Edinburgh. Glasgow\r\noccupied another day, so slow were their motions.\r\n\r\nThey travelled on to Dumbarton, where they had resolved to leave the\r\nequipage and to hire a boat to take them to the shores near the manse, as\r\nthe Gare-Loch lay betwixt them and that point, besides the impossibility\r\nof travelling in that district with wheel-carriages. Sir George\xc3\xads valet,\r\na man of trust, accompanied them, as also a footman; the grooms were left\r\nwith the carriage. Just as this arrangement was completed, which was\r\nabout four o\xc3\xadclock in the afternoon, an express arrived from Sir George\xc3\xads\r\nagent in Edinburgh, with a packet, which he opened and read with great\r\nattention, appearing much interested and agitated by the contents. The\r\npacket had been despatched very soon after their leaving Edinburgh, but\r\nthe messenger had missed the travellers by passing through Mid-Calder in\r\nthe night, and overshot his errand by getting to Roseneath before them.\r\nHe was now on his return, after having waited more than four-and-twenty\r\nhours. Sir George Staunton instantly wrote back an answer, and rewarding\r\nthe messenger liberally, desired him not to sleep till he placed it in\r\nhis agent\xc3\xads hands.\r\n\r\nAt length they embarked in the boat, which had waited for them some time.\r\nDuring their voyage, which was slow, for they were obliged to row the\r\nwhole way, and often against the tide, Sir George Staunton\xc3\xads inquiries\r\nran chiefly on the subject of the Highland banditti who had infested that\r\ncountry since the year 1745. Butler informed him that many of them were\r\nnot native Highlanders, but gipsies, tinkers, and other men of desperate\r\nfortunes, who had taken advantage of the confusion introduced by the\r\ncivil war, the general discontent of the mountaineers, and the unsettled\r\nstate of police, to practise their plundering trade with more audacity.\r\nSir George next inquired into their lives, their habits, whether the\r\nviolences which they committed were not sometimes atoned for by acts of\r\ngenerosity, and whether they did not possess the virtues as well as the\r\nvices of savage tribes?\r\n\r\nButler answered, that certainly they did sometimes show sparks of\r\ngenerosity, of which even the worst class of malefactors are seldom\r\nutterly divested; but that their evil propensities were certain and\r\nregular principles of action, while any occasional burst of virtuous\r\nfeeling was only a transient impulse not to be reckoned upon, and excited\r\nprobably by some singular and unusual concatenation of circumstances. In\r\ndiscussing these inquiries, which Sir George pursued with an apparent\r\neagerness that rather surprised Butler, the latter chanced to mention the\r\nname of Donacha dhu na Dunaigh, with which the reader is already\r\nacquainted. Sir George caught the sound up eagerly, and as if it conveyed\r\nparticular interest to his ear. He made the most minute inquiries\r\nconcerning the man whom he mentioned, the number of his gang, and even\r\nthe appearance of those who belonged to it. Upon these points Butler\r\ncould give little answer. The man had a name among the lower class, but\r\nhis exploits were considerably exaggerated; he had always one or two\r\nfellows with him, but never aspired to the command of above three or\r\nfour. In short, he knew little about him, and the small acquaintance he\r\nhad had by no means inclined him to desire more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, I should like to see him some of these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a dangerous meeting, Sir George, unless you mean we are to\r\nsee him receive his deserts from the law, and then it were a melancholy\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUse every man according to his deserts, Mr. Butler, and who shall escape\r\nwhipping? But I am talking riddles to you. I will explain them more fully\r\nto you when I have spoken over the subject with Lady Staunton.--Pull\r\naway, my lads,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing himself to the rowers; \xe2\x80\x9cthe clouds\r\nthreaten us with a storm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, the dead and heavy closeness of the air, the huge piles of\r\nclouds which assembled in the western horizon, and glowed like a furnace\r\nunder the influence of the setting sun--that awful stillness in which\r\nnature seems to expect the thunder-burst, as a condemned soldier waits\r\nfor the platoon fire which is to stretch him on the earth, all betokened\r\na speedy storm. Large broad drops fell from time to time, and induced the\r\ngentlemen to assume the boat-cloaks; but the rain again ceased, and the\r\noppressive heat, so unusual in Scotland in the end of May, inclined them\r\nto throw them aside. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something solemn in this delay of the\r\nstorm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George; \xe2\x80\x9cit seems as if it suspended its peal till it\r\nsolemnised some important event in the world below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are we that the laws of nature should\r\ncorrespond in their march with our ephemeral deeds or sufferings! The\r\nclouds will burst when surcharged with the electric fluid, whether a goat\r\nis falling at that instant from the cliffs of Arran, or a hero expiring\r\non the field of battle he has won.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mind delights to deem it otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George Staunton; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nto dwell on the fate of humanity as on that which is the prime central\r\nmovement of the mighty machine. We love not to think that we shall mix\r\nwith the ages that have gone before us, as these broad black raindrops\r\nmingle with the waste of waters, making a trifling and momentary eddy,\r\nand are then lost for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_For ever!_--we are not--we cannot be lost for ever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler,\r\nlooking upward; \xe2\x80\x9cdeath is to us change, not consummation; and the\r\ncommencement of a new existence, corresponding in character to the deeds\r\nwhich we have done in the body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they agitated these grave subjects, to which the solemnity of the\r\napproaching storm naturally led them, their voyage threatened to be more\r\ntedious than they expected, for gusts of wind, which rose and fell with\r\nsudden impetuosity, swept the bosom of the firth, and impeded the efforts\r\nof the rowers. They had now only to double a small headland, in order to\r\nget to the proper landing-place in the mouth of the little river; but in\r\nthe state of the weather, and the boat being heavy, this was like to be a\r\nwork of time, and in the meanwhile they must necessarily be exposed to\r\nthe storm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould we not land on this side of the headland,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir George, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nso gain some shelter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler knew of no landing-place, at least none affording a convenient or\r\neven practicable passage up the rocks which surrounded the shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George Staunton; \xe2\x80\x9cthe storm will soon be\r\nviolent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the boatmen, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xc3\xads the Caird\xc3\xads Cove; but we\r\ndinna tell the minister about it, and I am no sure if I can steer the\r\nboat to it, the bay is sae fa\xc3\xad o\xc3\xad shoals and sunk rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will give you half-a-guinea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old fellow took the helm, and observed, \xe2\x80\x9cThat, if they could get in,\r\nthere was a steep path up from the beach, and half-an-hour\xc3\xads walk from\r\nthence to the Manse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you know the way?\xe2\x80\x9d said Butler to the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI maybe kend it a wee better fifteen years syne, when Dandie Wilson was\r\nin the firth wi\xc3\xad his clean-ganging lugger. I mind Dandie had a wild young\r\nEnglisher wi\xc3\xad him, that they ca\xc3\xadd--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you chatter so much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will have the\r\nboat on the Grindstone--bring that white rock in a line with the\r\nsteeple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy G--,\xe2\x80\x9d said the veteran, staring, \xe2\x80\x9cI think your honour kens the bay as\r\nweel as me.--Your honour\xc3\xads nose has been on the Grindstone ere now, I\xc3\xadm\r\nthinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they spoke thus, they approached the little cove, which, concealed\r\nbehind crags, and defended on every point by shallows and sunken rocks,\r\ncould scarce be discovered or approached, except by those intimate with\r\nthe navigation. An old shattered boat was already drawn up on the beach\r\nwithin the cove, close beneath the trees, and with precautions for\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\nUpon observing this vessel, Butler remarked to his companion, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nimpossible for you to conceive, Sir George, the difficulty I have had\r\nwith my poor people, in teaching them the guilt and the danger of this\r\ncontraband trade--yet they have perpetually before their eyes all its\r\ndangerous consequences. I do not know anything that more effectually\r\ndepraves and ruins their moral and religious principles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir George forced himself to say something in a low voice about the\r\nspirit of adventure natural to youth, and that unquestionably many would\r\nbecome wiser as they grew older.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo seldom, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Butler. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they have been deeply engaged, and\r\nespecially if they, have mingled in the scenes of violence and blood to\r\nwhich their occupation naturally leads, I have observed, that, sooner or\r\nlater, they come to an evil end. Experience, as well as Scripture,\r\nteaches us, Sir George, that mischief shall hunt the violent man, and\r\nthat the bloodthirsty man shall not live half his days--But take my arm\r\nto help you ashore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir George needed assistance, for he was contrasting in his altered\r\nthought the different feelings of mind and frame with which he had\r\nformerly frequented the same place. As they landed, a low growl of\r\nthunder was heard at a distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is ominous, Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Intonuit laevum_--it is ominous of good, then,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Butler,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nThe boatmen were ordered to make the best of their way round the headland\r\nto the ordinary landing-place; the two gentlemen, followed by their\r\nservant, sought their way by a blind and tangled path, through a close\r\ncopsewood, to the Manse of Knocktarlitie, where their arrival was\r\nanxiously expected.\r\n\r\nThe sisters in vain had expected their husbands\xc3\xad return on the preceding\r\nday, which was that appointed by Sir George\xc3\xads letter. The delay of the\r\ntravellers at Calder had occasioned this breach of appointment. The\r\ninhabitants of the Manse began even to doubt whether they would arrive on\r\nthe present day. Lady Staunton felt this hope of delay as a brief\r\nreprieve, for she dreaded the pangs which her husband\xc3\xads pride must\r\nundergo at meeting with a sister-in-law, to whom the whole of his unhappy\r\nand dishonourable history was too well known. She knew, whatever force or\r\nconstraint he might put upon his feelings in public, that she herself\r\nmust be doomed to see them display themselves in full vehemence in\r\nsecret,--consume his health, destroy his temper, and render him at once\r\nan object of dread and compassion. Again and again she cautioned Jeanie\r\nto display no tokens of recognition, but to receive him as a perfect\r\nstranger,--and again and again Jeanie renewed her promise to comply with\r\nher wishes.\r\n\r\nJeanie herself could not fail to bestow an anxious thought on the\r\nawkwardness of the approaching meeting; but her conscience was\r\nungalled--and then she was cumbered with many household cares of an\r\nunusual nature, which, joined to the anxious wish once more to see\r\nButler, after an absence of unusual length, made her extremely desirous\r\nthat the travellers should arrive as soon as possible. And--why should I\r\ndisguise the truth?--ever and anon a thought stole across her mind that\r\nher gala dinner had now been postponed for two days; and how few of the\r\ndishes, after every art of her simple cuisine had been exerted to dress\r\nthem, could with any credit or propriety appear again upon the third;\r\nand what was she to do with the rest?--Upon this last subject she was\r\nsaved the trouble of farther deliberation, by the sudden appearance of\r\nthe Captain at the head of half-a-dozen stout fellows, dressed and armed\r\nin the Highland fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoot-morrow morning to ye, Leddy Staunton, and I hope I hae the pleasure\r\nto see you weel--And goot-morrow to you, goot Mrs. Putler--I do peg you\r\nwill order some victuals and ale and prandy for the lads, for we hae peen\r\nout on firth and moor since afore daylight, and a\xc3\xad to no purpose\r\nneither--Cot tam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he sate down, pushed back his brigadier wig, and wiped his\r\nhead with an air of easy importance; totally regardless of the look of\r\nwell-bred astonishment by which Lady Staunton endeavoured to make him\r\ncomprehend that he was assuming too great a liberty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is some comfort, when one has had a sair tussel,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nCaptain, addressing Lady Staunton, with an air of gallantry, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is\r\nin a fair leddy\xc3\xads service, or in the service of a gentleman whilk has a\r\nfair leddy, whilk is the same thing, since serving the husband is serving\r\nthe wife, as Mrs. Putler does very weel know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Staunton, \xe2\x80\x9cas you seem to intend this compliment\r\nfor me, I am at a loss to know what interest Sir George or I can have in\r\nyour movements this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Cot tam!--this is too cruel, my leddy--as if it was not py special\r\nexpress from his Grace\xc3\xads honourable agent and commissioner at Edinburgh,\r\nwith a warrant conform, that I was to seek for and apprehend Donacha dhu\r\nna Dunaigh, and pring him pefore myself and Sir George Staunton, that he\r\nmay have his deserts, that is to say, the gallows, whilk he has doubtless\r\ndeserved, py peing the means of frightening your leddyship, as weel as\r\nfor something of less importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrightening me!\xe2\x80\x9d said her ladyship; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, I never wrote to Sir George\r\nabout my alarm at the waterfall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he must have heard it otherwise; for what else can give him sic an\r\nearnest tesire to see this rapscallion, that I maun ripe the haill mosses\r\nand muirs in the country for him, as if I were to get something for\r\nfinding him, when the pest o\xc3\xadt might pe a pall through my prains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be really true, that it is on Sir George\xc3\xads account that you have\r\nbeen attempting to apprehend this fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPy Cot, it is for no other cause that I know than his honour\xc3\xads pleasure;\r\nfor the creature might hae gone on in a decent quiet way for me, sae lang\r\nas he respectit the Duke\xc3\xads pounds--put reason goot he suld be taen, and\r\nhangit to poet, if it may pleasure ony honourable shentleman that is the\r\nDuke\xc3\xads friend--Sae I got the express over night, and I caused warn half a\r\nscore of pretty lads, and was up in the morning pefore the sun, and I\r\ngarr\xc3\xadd the lads take their kilts and short coats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder you did that, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you know the\r\nact of Parliament against wearing the Highland dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHout, tout, ne\xc3\xader fash your thumb, Mrs. Putler. The law is put twa-three\r\nyears auld yet, and is ower young to hae come our length; and pesides,\r\nhow is the lads to climb the praes wi\xc3\xad thae tamn\xc3\xadd breekens on them? It\r\nmakes me sick to see them. Put ony how, I thought I kend Donacha\xc3\xads haunt\r\ngey and weel, and I was at the place where he had rested yestreen; for I\r\nsaw the leaves the limmers had lain on, and the ashes of them; by the\r\nsame token, there was a pit greeshoch purning yet. I am thinking they got\r\nsome word oat o\xc3\xad the island what was intended--I sought every glen and\r\nclench, as if I had been deer-stalking, but teil a want of his coat-tail\r\ncould I see--Cot tam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xc3\xadll be away down the Firth to Cowal,\xe2\x80\x9d said David; and Reuben, who had\r\nbeen out early that morning a-nutting, observed, \xe2\x80\x9cThat he had seen a boat\r\nmaking for the Caird\xc3\xads Cove;\xe2\x80\x9d a place well known to the boys, though\r\ntheir less adventurous father was ignorant of its existence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPy Cot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I will stay here no longer than to trink\r\nthis very horn of prandy and water, for it\xc3\xads very possible they will pe\r\nin the wood. Donacha\xc3\xads a clever fellow, and maype thinks it pest to sit\r\nnext the chimley when the lum reeks. He thought naebody would look for\r\nhim sae near hand! I peg your leddyship will excuse my aprupt departure,\r\nas I will return forthwith, and I will either pring you Donacha in life,\r\nor else his head, whilk I dare to say will be as satisfactory. And I hope\r\nto pass a pleasant evening with your leddyship; and I hope to have mine\r\nrevenges on Mr. Putler at backgammon, for the four pennies whilk he won,\r\nfor he will pe surely at home soon, or else he will have a wet journey,\r\nseeing it is apout to pe a scud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus saying, with many scrapes and bows, and apologies for leaving them,\r\nwhich were very readily received, and reiterated assurances of his speedy\r\nreturn (of the sincerity whereof Mrs. Butler entertained no doubt, so\r\nlong as her best greybeard of brandy was upon duty), Duncan left the\r\nManse, collected his followers, and began to scour the close and\r\nentangled wood which lay between the little glen and the Caird\xc3\xads Cove.\r\nDavid, who was a favourite with the Captain, on account of his spirit and\r\ncourage, took the opportunity of escaping, to attend the investigations\r\nof that great man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTH.\r\n\r\n                         I did send for thee,\r\n             That Talbot\xc3\xads name might be in thee revived,\r\n               When sapless age and weak, unable limbs,\r\n             Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.\r\n                But--O malignant and ill-boding stars!--\r\n                             First part of Henry the Sixth.\r\n\r\nDuncan and his party had not proceeded very far in the direction of the\r\nCaird\xc3\xads Cove before they heard a shot, which was quickly followed by one\r\nor two others. \xe2\x80\x9cSome tamn\xc3\xadd villains among the roe-deer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clook sharp out, lads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clash of swords was next heard, and Duncan and his myrmidons,\r\nhastening to the spot, found Butler and Sir George Staunton\xc3\xads servant in\r\nthe hands of four ruffians. Sir George himself lay stretched on the\r\nground, with his drawn sword in his hand. Duncan, who was as brave as a\r\nlion, instantly fired his pistol at the leader of the band, unsheathed\r\nhis sword, cried out to his men, _Claymore!_ and run his weapon through\r\nthe body of the fellow whom he had previously wounded, who was no other\r\nthau Donacha dhu na Dunaigh himself. The other banditti were speedily\r\noverpowered, excepting one young lad, who made wonderful resistance for\r\nhis years, and was at length secured with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Death of Sir George Staunton--404]\r\n\r\n\r\nButler, so soon as he was liberated from the ruffians, ran to raise Sir\r\nGeorge Staunton, but life had wholly left him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA creat misfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duncan; \xe2\x80\x9cI think it will pe pest that I go\r\nforward to intimate it to the coot lady.--Tavie, my dear, you hae smelled\r\npouther for the first time this day--take my sword and hack off Donacha\xc3\xads\r\nhead, whilk will pe coot practice for you against the time you may wish\r\nto do the same kindness to a living shentleman--or hould! as your father\r\ndoes not approve, you may leave it alone, as he will pe a greater object\r\nof satisfaction to Leddy Staunton to see him entire; and I hope she will\r\ndo me the credit to pelieve that I can afenge a shentleman\xc3\xads plood fery\r\nspeedily and well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the observation of a man too much accustomed to the ancient\r\nstate of manners in the Highlands, to look upon the issue of such a\r\nskirmish as anything worthy of wonder or emotion.\r\n\r\nWe will not attempt to describe the very contrary effect which the\r\nunexpected disaster produced upon Lady Staunton, when the bloody corpse\r\nof her husband was brought to the house, where she expected to meet him\r\nalive and well. All was forgotten, but that he was the lover of her\r\nyouth; and whatever were his faults to the world, that he had towards her\r\nexhibited only those that arose from the inequality of spirits and\r\ntemper, incident to a situation of unparalleled difficulty. In the\r\nvivacity of her grief she gave way to all the natural irritability of her\r\ntemper; shriek followed shriek, and swoon succeeded to swoon. It required\r\nall Jeanie\xc3\xads watchful affection to prevent her from making known, in\r\nthese paroxysms of affliction, much which it was of the highest\r\nimportance that she should keep secret.\r\n\r\nAt length silence and exhaustion succeeded to frenzy, and Jeanie stole\r\nout to take counsel with her husband, and to exhort him to anticipate the\r\nCaptain\xc3\xads interference, by taking possession, in Lady Staunton\xc3\xads name, of\r\nthe private papers of her deceased husband. To the utter astonishment of\r\nButler, she now, for the first time, explained the relation betwixt\r\nherself and Lady Staunton, which authorised, nay, demanded, that he\r\nshould prevent any stranger from being unnecessarily made acquainted with\r\nher family affairs. It was in such a crisis that Jeanie\xc3\xads active and\r\nundaunted habits of virtuous exertion were most conspicuous. While the\r\nCaptain\xc3\xads attention was still engaged by a prolonged refreshment, and a\r\nvery tedious examination, in Gaelic and English, of all the prisoners,\r\nand every other witness of the fatal transaction, she had the body of her\r\nbrother-in-law undressed and properly disposed. It then appeared, from\r\nthe crucifix, the beads, and the shirt of hair which he wore next his\r\nperson, that his sense of guilt had induced him to receive the dogmata of\r\na religion, which pretends, by the maceration of the body, to expiate the\r\ncrimes of the soul. In the packet of papers which the express had brought\r\nto Sir George Staunton from Edinburgh, and which Butler, authorised by\r\nhis connection with the deceased, did not scruple to examine, he found\r\nnew and astonishing intelligence, which gave him reason to thank God he\r\nhad taken that measure.\r\n\r\nRatcliffe, to whom all sorts of misdeeds and misdoers were familiar,\r\ninstigated by the promised reward, soon found himself in a condition to\r\ntrace the infant of these unhappy parents. The woman to whom Meg\r\nMurdockson had sold that most unfortunate child, had made it the\r\ncompanion of her wanderings and her beggary, until he was about seven or\r\neight years old, when, as Ratcliffe learned from a companion of hers,\r\nthen in the Correction House of Edinburgh, she sold him in her turn to\r\nDonacha dhu na Dunaigh. This man, to whom no act of mischief was unknown,\r\nwas occasionally an agent in a horrible trade then carried on betwixt\r\nScotland and America, for supplying the plantations with servants, by\r\nmeans of _kidnapping,_ as it was termed, both men and women, but\r\nespecially children under age. Here Ratcliffe lost sight of the boy, but\r\nhad no doubt but Donacha Dhu could give an account of him. The gentleman\r\nof the law, so often mentioned, despatched therefore an express, with a\r\nletter to Sir George Staunton, and another covering a warrant for\r\napprehension of Donacha, with instructions to the Captain of Knockdunder\r\nto exert his utmost energy for that purpose.\r\n\r\nPossessed of this information, and with a mind agitated by the most\r\ngloomy apprehensions, Butler now joined the Captain, and obtained from\r\nhim with some difficulty a sight of the examinations. These, with a few\r\nquestions to the elder of the prisoners, soon confirmed the most dreadful\r\nof Butler\xc3\xads anticipations. We give the heads of the information, without\r\ndescending into minute details.\r\n\r\nDonacha Dhu had indeed purchased Effie\xc3\xads unhappy child, with the purpose\r\nof selling it to the American traders, whom he had been in the habit of\r\nsupplying with human flesh. But no opportunity occurred for some time;\r\nand the boy, who was known by the name of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Whistler,\xe2\x80\x9d made some\r\nimpression on the heart and affections even of this rude savage, perhaps\r\nbecause he saw in him flashes of a spirit as fierce and vindictive as his\r\nown. When Donacha struck or threatened him--a very common occurrence--he\r\ndid not answer with complaints and entreaties like other children, but\r\nwith oaths and efforts at revenge--he had all the wild merit, too, by\r\nwhich Woggarwolfe\xc3\xads arrow-bearing page won the hard heart of his master:\r\n\r\n             Like a wild cub, rear\xc3\xadd at the ruffian\xc3\xads feet,\r\n             He could say biting jests, bold ditties sing,\r\n             And quaff his foaming bumper at the board,\r\n                 With all the mockery of a little man.*\r\n\r\n* Ethwald.\r\n\r\nIn short, as Donacha Dhu said, the Whistler was a born imp of Satan, and\r\n_therefore_ he should never leave him. Accordingly, from his eleventh\r\nyear forward, he was one of the band, and often engaged in acts of\r\nviolence. The last of these was more immediately occasioned by the\r\nresearches which the Whistler\xc3\xads real father made after him whom he had\r\nbeen taught to consider as such. Donacha Dhu\xc3\xads fears had been for some\r\ntime excited by the strength of the means which began now to be employed\r\nagainst persons of his description. He was sensible he existed only by\r\nthe precarious indulgence of his namesake, Duncan of Knockdunder, who was\r\nused to boast that he could put him down or string him up when he had a\r\nmind. He resolved to leave the kingdom by means of one of those sloops\r\nwhich were engaged in the traffic of his old kidnapping friends, and\r\nwhich was about to sail for America; but he was desirous first to strike\r\na bold stroke.\r\n\r\nThe ruffian\xc3\xads cupidity was excited by the intelligence, that a wealthy\r\nEnglishman was coming to the Manse--he had neither forgotten the\r\nWhistler\xc3\xads report of the gold he had seen in Lady Staunton\xc3\xads purse, nor\r\nhis old vow of revenge against the minister; and, to bring the whole to a\r\npoint, he conceived the hope of appropriating the money, which, according\r\nto the general report of the country, the minister was to bring from\r\nEdinburgh to pay for his pew purchase. While he was considering how he\r\nmight best accomplish his purpose, he received the intelligence from one\r\nquarter, that the vessel in which he proposed to sail was to sail\r\nimmediately from Greenock; from another, that the minister and a rich\r\nEnglish lord, with a great many thousand pounds, were expected the next\r\nevening at the Manse; and from a third, that he must consult his safety\r\nby leaving his ordinary haunts as soon as possible, for that the Captain\r\nhad ordered out a party to scour the glens for him at break of day.\r\nDonacha laid his plans with promptitude and decision. He embarked with\r\nthe Whistler and two others of his band (whom, by the by, he meant to\r\nsell to the kidnappers), and set sail for the Caird\xc3\xads Cove. He intended\r\nto lurk till nightfall in the wood adjoining to this place, which he\r\nthought was too near the habitation of men to excite the suspicion of\r\nDuncan Knock, then break into Butler\xc3\xads peaceful habitation, and flesh at\r\nonce his appetite for plunder and revenge. When his villany was\r\naccomplished, his boat was to convey him to the vessel, which, according\r\nto previous agreement with the master, was instantly to set sail.\r\n\r\nThis desperate design would probably have succeeded, but for the ruffians\r\nbeing discovered in their lurking-place by Sir George Staunton and\r\nButler, in their accidental walk from the Caird\xc3\xads Cove towards the Manse.\r\nFinding himself detected, and at the same time observing that the servant\r\ncarried a casket, or strong-box, Donacha conceived that both his prize\r\nand his victims were within his power, and attacked the travellers\r\nwithout hesitation. Shots were fired and swords drawn on both sides; Sir\r\nGeorge Staunton offered the bravest resistance till he fell, as there was\r\ntoo much reason to believe, by the hand of a son, so long sought, and now\r\nat length so unhappily met.\r\n\r\nWhile Butler was half-stunned with this intelligence, the hoarse voice of\r\nKnockdunder added to his consternation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take the liperty to take down the pell-ropes, Mr. Putler, as I\r\nmust pe taking order to hang these idle people up to-morrow morning, to\r\nteach them more consideration in their doings in future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler entreated him to remember the act abolishing the heritable\r\njurisdictions, and that he ought to send them to Glasgow or Inverary, to\r\nbe tried by the Circuit. Duncan scorned the proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Jurisdiction Act,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chad nothing to do put with the rebels,\r\nand specially not with Argyle\xc3\xads country; and he would hang the men up all\r\nthree in one row before coot Leddy Staunton\xc3\xads windows, which would be a\r\ngreat comfort to her in the morning to see that the coot gentleman, her\r\nhusband, had been suitably afenged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the utmost length that Butler\xc3\xads most earnest entreaties could prevail\r\nwas, that he would, reserve \xe2\x80\x9cthe twa pig carles for the Circuit, but as\r\nfor him they ca\xc3\xadd the Fustler, he should try how he could fustle in a\r\nswinging tow, for it suldna be said that a shentleman, friend to the\r\nDuke, was killed in his country, and his people didna take at least twa\r\nlives for ane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nButler entreated him to spare the victim for his soul\xc3\xads sake. But\r\nKnockdunder answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the soul of such a scum had been long the\r\ntefil\xc3\xads property, and that, Cot tam! he was determined to gif the tefil\r\nhis due.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll persuasion was in vain, and Duncan issued his mandate for execution\r\non the succeeding morning. The child of guilt and misery was separated\r\nfrom his companions, strongly pinioned, and committed to a separate room,\r\nof which the Captain kept the key.\r\n\r\nIn the silence of the night, however, Mrs. Butler arose, resolved, if\r\npossible, to avert, at least to delay, the fate which hung over her\r\nnephew, especially if, upon conversing with him, she should see any hope\r\nof his being brought to better temper. She had a master-key that opened\r\nevery lock in the house; and at midnight, when all was still, she stood\r\nbefore the eyes of the astonished young savage, as, hard bound with\r\ncords, he lay, like a sheep designed for slaughter, upon a quantity of\r\nthe refuse of flax which filled a corner in the apartment. Amid features\r\nsunburnt, tawny, grimed with dirt, and obscured by his shaggy hair of a\r\nrusted black colour, Jeanie tried in vain to trace the likeness of either\r\nof his very handsome parents. Yet how could she refuse compassion to a\r\ncreature so young and so wretched,--so much more wretched than even he\r\nhimself could be aware of, since the murder he had too probably committed\r\nwith his own hand, but in which he had at any rate participated, was in\r\nfact a parricide? She placed food on a table near him, raised him, and\r\nslacked the cords on his arms, so as to permit him to feed himself. He\r\nstretched out his hands, still smeared with blood perhaps that of his\r\nfather, and he ate voraciously and in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your first name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, by way of opening the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Whistler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your Christian name, by which you were baptized?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was baptized that I know of--I have no other name than the\r\nWhistler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor unhappy abandoned lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would ye do if you could\r\nescape from this place, and the death you are to die to-morrow morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoin wi\xc3\xad Rob Roy, or wi\xc3\xad Sergeant More Cameron\xe2\x80\x9d (noted freebooters at\r\nthat time), \xe2\x80\x9cand revenge Donacha\xc3\xads death on all and sundry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO ye unhappy boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeanie, \xe2\x80\x9cdo ye ken what will come o\xc3\xad ye when ye\r\ndie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall neither feel cauld nor hunger more,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth doggedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo let him be execute in this dreadful state of mind would be to destroy\r\nbaith body and soul--and to let him gang I dare not--what will be done?--\r\nBut he is my sister\xc3\xads son--my own nephew--our flesh and blood--and his\r\nhands and feet are yerked as tight as cords can be drawn.--Whistler, do\r\nthe cords hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, if I were to slacken them, you would harm me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I would not--you never harmed me or mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere may be good in him yet, thought Jeanie; I will try fair play with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nShe cut his bonds--he stood upright, looked round with a laugh of wild\r\nexultation, clapped his hands together, and sprung from the ground, as if\r\nin transport on finding himself at liberty. He looked so wild, that\r\nJeanie trembled at what she had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me out,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young savage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wunna, unless you promise\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xc3\xadll make you glad to let us both out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized the lighted candle and threw it among the flax, which was\r\ninstantly in a flame. Jeanie screamed, and ran out of the room; the\r\nprisoner rushed past her, threw open a window in the passage, jumped into\r\nthe garden, sprung over its enclosure, bounded through the woods like a\r\ndeer, and gained the seashore. Meantime, the fire was extinguished, but\r\nthe prisoner was sought in vain. As Jeanie kept her own secret, the share\r\nshe had in his escape was not discovered: but they learned his fate some\r\ntime afterwards--it was as wild as his life had hitherto been.\r\n\r\nThe anxious inquiries of Butler at length learned, that the youth had\r\ngained the ship in which his master, Donacha, had designed to embark. But\r\nthe avaricious shipmaster, inured by his evil trade to every species of\r\ntreachery, and disappointed of the rich booty which Donacha had proposed\r\nto bring aboard, secured the person of the fugitive, and having\r\ntransported him to America, sold him as a slave, or indented servant, to\r\na Virginian planter, far up the country. When these tidings reached\r\nButler, he sent over to America a sufficient sum to redeem the lad from\r\nslavery, with instructions that measures should be taken for improving\r\nhis mind, restraining his evil propensities, and encouraging whatever\r\ngood might appear in his character. But this aid came too late. The young\r\nman had headed a conspiracy in which his inhuman master was put to death,\r\nand had then fled to the next tribe of wild Indians. He was never more\r\nheard of; and it may therefore be presumed that he lived and died after\r\nthe manner of that savage people, with whom his previous habits had well\r\nfitted him to associate.\r\n\r\nAll hopes of the young man\xc3\xads reformation being now ended, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nButler thought it could serve no purpose to explain to Lady Staunton a\r\nhistory so full of horror. She remained their guest more than a year,\r\nduring the greater part of which period her grief was excessive. In the\r\nlatter months, it assumed the appearance of listlessness and low spirits,\r\nwhich the monotony of her sister\xc3\xads quiet establishment afforded no means\r\nof dissipating. Effie, from her earliest youth, was never formed for a\r\nquiet low content. Far different from her sister, she required the\r\ndissipation of society to divert her sorrow, or enhance her joy. She left\r\nthe seclusion of Knocktarlitie with tears of sincere affection, and after\r\nheaping its inmates with all she could think of that might be valuable in\r\ntheir eyes. But she _did_ leave it; and, when the anguish of the parting\r\nwas over, her departure was a relief to both sisters.\r\n\r\nThe family at the Manse of Knocktarlitie, in their own quiet happiness,\r\nheard of the well-dowered and beautiful Lady Staunton resuming her place\r\nin the fashionable world. They learned it by more substantial proofs, for\r\nDavid received a commission; and as the military spirit of Bible Butler\r\nseemed to have revived in him, his good behaviour qualified the envy of\r\nfive hundred young Highland cadets, \xe2\x80\x9ccome of good houses,\xe2\x80\x9d who were\r\nastonished at the rapidity of his promotion. Reuben followed the law, and\r\nrose more slowly, yet surely. Euphemia Butler, whose fortune, augmented\r\nby her aunt\xc3\xads generosity, and added to her own beauty, rendered her no\r\nsmall prize, married a Highland laird, who never asked the name of her\r\ngrand-father, and was loaded on the occasion with presents from Lady\r\nStaunton, which made her the envy of all the beauties in Dumbarton and\r\nArgyle shires.\r\n\r\nAfter blazing nearly ten years in the fashionable world, and hiding, like\r\nmany of her compeers, an aching heart with a gay demeanour--after\r\ndeclining repeated offers of the most respectable kind for a second\r\nmatrimonial engagement, Lady Staunton betrayed the inward wound by\r\nretiring to the Continent, and taking up her abode in the convent where\r\nshe had received her education. She never took the veil, but lived and\r\ndied in severe seclusion, and in the practice of the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion, in all its formal observances, vigils, and austerities.\r\n\r\nJeanie had so much of her father\xc3\xads spirit as to sorrow bitterly for this\r\napostasy, and Butler joined in her regret. \xe2\x80\x9cYet any religion, however\r\nimperfect,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas better than cold scepticism, or the hurrying\r\ndin of dissipation, which fills the ears of worldlings, until they care\r\nfor none of these things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, happy in each other, in the prosperity of their family, and\r\nthe love and honour of all who knew them, this simple pair lived beloved,\r\nand died lamented.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jeanie Dean\xc3\xads Cottage--414]\r\n\r\n\r\n          READER,\r\n\r\n          THIS TALE WILL NOT BE TOLD IN VAIN, IF IT SHALL BE FOUND TO\r\n          ILLUSTRATE THE GREAT TRUTH, THAT GUILT, THOUGH IT MAY ATTAIN\r\n          TEMPORAL SPLENDOUR, CAN NEVER CONFER REAL HAPPINESS; THAT THE\r\n          EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF OUR CRIMES LONG SURVIVE THEIR COMMISSION,\r\n          AND, LIKE THE GHOSTS OF THE MURDERED, FOR EVER HAUNT THE STEPS\r\n          OF THE MALEFACTOR; AND THAT THE PATHS OF VIRTUE, THOUGH SELDOM\r\n          THOSE OF WORLDLY GREATNESS, ARE ALWAYS THOSE OF PLEASANTNESS\r\n          AND PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 L\xc3\xadENVOY,\r\n\r\n                        BY JEDEDIAH CLEISHBOTHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus concludeth the Tale of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart of Mid-Lothian,\xe2\x80\x9d which hath filled\r\nmore pages than I opined. The Heart of Mid-Lothian is now no more, or\r\nrather it is transferred to the extreme side of the city, even as the\r\nSieur Jean Baptiste Poquelin hath it, in his pleasant comedy called _Le\r\nMe\xc3\xaddecin Malgre\xc3\xad Lui,_ where the simulated doctor wittily replieth to a\r\ncharge, that he had placed the heart on the right side, instead of the\r\nleft, \xe2\x80\x9c_Cela e\xc3\xadtait autrefois ainsi, mais nous avons change\xc3\xad tout cela._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Of which witty speech if any reader shall demand the purport, I have only\r\nto respond, that I teach the French as well as the Classical tongues, at\r\nthe easy rate of five shillings per quarter, as my advertisements are\r\nperiodically making known to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    NOTES TO THE HEART OF MID-LOTHIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A--Author\xc3\xads connection with Quakerism.\r\n\r\nIt is an old proverb, that \xe2\x80\x9cmany a true word is spoken in jest.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nexistence of Walter Scott, third son of Sir William Scott of Harden, is\r\ninstructed, as it is called, by a charter under the great seal, Domino\r\nWillielmo Scott de Harden Militi, et Waltero Scott suo filio legitimo\r\ntertio genito, terrarum de Roberton.*\r\n\r\n* See Douglas\xc3\xads _Baronage,_ page 215.\r\n\r\nThe munificent old gentleman left all his four sons considerable estates.\r\nand settled those of Eilrig and Raeburn, together with valuable\r\npossessions around Lessuden, upon Walter, his third son, who is ancestor\r\nof the Scotts of Raeburn, and of the Author of Waverley. He appears to\r\nhave become a convert to the doctrine of the Quakers, or Friends, and a\r\ngreat assertor of their peculiar tenets. This was probably at the time\r\nwhen George Fox, the celebrated apostle of the sect, made an expedition\r\ninto the south of Scotland about 1657, on which occasion, he boasts, that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas he first set his horse\xc3\xads feet upon Scottish ground, he felt the seed\r\nof grace to sparkle about him like innumerable sparks of fire.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon the\r\nsame occasion, probably, Sir Gideon Scott of Highchester, second son of\r\nSir William, immediate elder brother of Walter, and ancestor of the\r\nauthor\xc3\xads friend and kinsman, the present representative of the family of\r\nHarden, also embraced the tenets of Quakerism. This last convert, Gideon,\r\nentered into a controversy with the Rev. James Kirkton, author of the\r\n_Secret and True History of the Church of Scotland,_ which is noticed by\r\nmy ingenious friend Mr. Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, in his valuable and\r\ncurious edition of that work, 4to, 1817. Sir William Scott, eldest of the\r\nbrothers, remained, amid the defection of his two younger brethren, an\r\northodox member of the Presbyterian Church, and used such means for\r\nreclaiming Walter of Raeburn from his heresy, as savoured far more of\r\npersecution than persuasion. In this he was assisted by MacDougal of\r\nMakerston, brother to Isabella MacDougal, the wife of the said Walter,\r\nand who, like her husband, had conformed to the Quaker tenets.\r\n\r\nThe interest possessed by Sir William Scott and Makerston was powerful\r\nenough to procure the two following acts of the Privy Council of\r\nScotland, directed against Walter of Raeburn as an heretic and convert to\r\nQuakerism, appointing him to be imprisoned first in Edinburgh jail, and\r\nthen in that of Jedburgh; and his children to be taken by force from the\r\nsociety and direction of their parents, and educated at a distance from\r\nthem, besides the assignment of a sum for their maintenance, sufficient\r\nin those times to be burdensome to a moderate Scottish estate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApud Edin., vigesimo Junii 1665.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lords of his Magesty\xc3\xads Privy Council having receaved information\r\nthat Scott of Raeburn, and Isobel Mackdougall, his wife, being infected\r\nwith the error of Quakerism, doe endeavour to breid and trains up\r\nWilliam, Walter, and Isobel Scotts, their children, in the same\r\nprofession, doe therefore give order and command to Sir William Scott of\r\nHarden, the said Raeburn\xc3\xads brother, to seperat and take away the saids\r\nchildren from the custody and society of the saids parents, and to cause\r\neducat and bring them up in his owne house, or any other convenient\r\nplace, and ordaines letters to be direct at the said Sir William\xc3\xads\r\ninstance against Raeburn, for a maintenance to the saids children, and\r\nthat the said Sir Wm. give ane account of his diligence with all\r\nconveniency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdinburgh, 5th July 1666.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnent a petition presented be Sir Wm. Scott of Harden, for himself and\r\nin name and behalf of the three children of Walter Scott of Raeburn, his\r\nbrother, showing that the Lords of Councill, by ane act of the 22d day of\r\nJunii 1665, did grant power and warrand to the petitioner, to separat and\r\ntake away Raeburn\xc3\xads children, from his family and education, and to breed\r\nthem in some convenient place, where they might be free from all\r\ninfection in their younger years, from the principalls of Quakerism, and,\r\nfor maintenance of the saids children, did ordain letters to be direct\r\nagainst Raeburn; and, seeing the Petitioner, in obedience to the said\r\norder, did take away the saids children, being two sonnes and a daughter,\r\nand after some paines taken upon them in his owne family, hes sent them\r\nto the city of Glasgow, to be bread at schooles, and there to be\r\nprincipled with the knowledge of the true religion, and that it is\r\nnecessary the Councill determine what shall be the maintenance for which\r\nRaeburn\xc3\xads three children may be charged, as likewise that Raeburn\r\nhimself, being now in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, where he dayley\r\nconverses with all the Quakers who are prisoners there, and others who\r\ndaily resort to them, whereby he is hardened in his pernitious opinions\r\nand principles, without all hope of recovery, unlesse he be separat from\r\nsuch pernitious company, humbly therefore, desyring that the Councell\r\nmight determine upon the soume of money to be payed be Raeburn, for the\r\neducation of his children, to the petitioner, who will be countable\r\ntherefor; and that, in order to his conversion, the place of his\r\nimprisonment may be changed. The Lords of his Maj. Privy Councell having\r\nat length heard and considered the foresaid petition, doe modifie the\r\nsoume of two thousand pounds Scots, to be payed yearly at the terms of\r\nWhitsunday be the said Walter Scott of Raeburn, furth of his estate to\r\nthe petitioner, for the entertainment and education of the said children,\r\nbeginning the first termes payment therof at Whitsunday last for the half\r\nyear preceding, and so furth yearly, at the said terme of Whitsunday in\r\ntym comeing till furder orders; and ordaines the said Walter Scott of\r\nRaeburn to be transported from the tolbooth of Edinburgh to the prison of\r\nJedburgh, where his friends and others may have occasion to convert him.\r\nAnd to the effect he may be secured from the practice of other Quakers,\r\nthe said Lords doe hereby discharge the magistrates of Jedburgh to suffer\r\nany persons suspect of these principles to have access to him; and in\r\ncase any contraveen, that they secure ther persons till they be therfore\r\npuneist; and ordaines letters to be direct heirupon in form, as effeirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n Both the sons, thus harshly separated from their father, proved good\r\nscholars. The eldest, William, who carried on the line of Raeburn, was,\r\nlike his father, a deep Orientalist; the younger, Walter, became a good\r\nclassical scholar, a great friend and correspondent of the celebrated Dr.\r\nPitcairn, and a Jacobite so distinguished for zeal, that he made a vow\r\nnever to shave his beard till the restoration of the exiled family. This\r\nlast Walter Scott was the author\xc3\xads great-grandfather.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another link betwixt the author and the simple-minded and\r\nexcellent Society of Friends, through a proselyte of much more importance\r\nthan Walter Scott of Raeburn. The celebrated John Swinton, of Swinton,\r\nnineteenth baron in descent of that ancient and once powerful family,\r\nwas, with Sir William Lockhart of Lee, the person whom Cromwell chiefly\r\ntrusted in the management of the Scottish affairs during his usurpation.\r\nAfter the Restoration, Swinton was devoted as a victim to the new order\r\nof things, and was brought down in the same vessel which conveyed the\r\nMarquis of Argyle to Edinburgh, where that nobleman was tried and\r\nexecuted. Swinton was destined to the same fate. He had assumed the\r\nhabit, and entered into the Society of the Quakers, and appeared as one\r\nof their number before the Parliament of Scotland. He renounced all legal\r\ndefence, though several pleas were open to him, and answered, in\r\nconformity to the principles of his sect, that at the time these crimes\r\nwere imputed to him, he was in the gall of bitterness and bond of\r\niniquity; but that God Almighty having since called him to the light, he\r\nsaw and acknowledged these errors, and did not refuse to pay the forfeit\r\nof them, even though, in the judgment of the Parliament, it should extend\r\nto life itself.\r\n\r\nRespect to fallen greatness, and to the patience and calm resignation\r\nwith which a man once in high power expressed himself under such a change\r\nof fortune, found Swinton friends; family connections, and some\r\ninterested considerations of Middleton the Commissioner, joined to\r\nprocure his safety, and he was dismissed, but after a long imprisonment,\r\nand much dilapidation of his estates. It is said that Swinton\xc3\xads\r\nadmonitions, while confined in the Castle of Edinburgh, had a\r\nconsiderable share in converting to the tenets of the Friends Colonel\r\nDavid Barclay, then lying there in the garrison. This was the father of\r\nRobert Barclay, author of the celebrated _Apology for the Quakers._ It\r\nmay be observed among the inconsistencies of human nature, that Kirkton,\r\nWodrow, and other Presbyterian authors, who have detailed the sufferings\r\nof their own sect for nonconformity with the established church, censure\r\nthe government of the time for not exerting the civil power against the\r\npeaceful enthusiasts we have treated of, and some express particular\r\nchagrin at the escape of Swinton. Whatever might be his motives for\r\nassuming the tenets of the Friends, the old man retained them faithfully\r\ntill the close of his life.\r\n\r\nJean Swinton, grand-daughter of Sir John Swinton, son of Judge Swinton,\r\nas the Quaker was usually termed, was mother of Anne Rutherford, the\r\nauthor\xc3\xads mother.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, as in the play of the Anti-Jacobin, the ghost of the author\xc3\xads\r\ngrandmother having arisen to speak the Epilogue, it is full time to\r\nconclude, lest the reader should remonstrate that his desire to know the\r\nAuthor of Waverley never included a wish to be acquainted with his whole\r\nancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE B.--TOMBSTONE TO HELEN WALKER.\r\n\r\nOn Helen Walker\xc3\xads tombstone in Irongray churchyard, Dumfriesshire, there\r\nis engraved the following epitaph, written by Sir Walter Scott:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THIS STONE WAS ERECTED\r\n                       BY THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY\r\n\r\n                             TO THE MEMORY\r\n                                   OF\r\n                              HELEN WALKER,\r\n\r\n                    WHO DIED IN THE YEAR OF GOD 1791.\r\n\r\n             THIS HUMBLE INDIVIDUAL PRACTISED IN REAL LIFE\r\n                              THE VIRTUES\r\n                    WITH WHICH FICTION HAS INVESTED\r\n\r\n                       THE IMAGINARY CHARACTER OF\r\n\r\n                              JEANIE DEANS;\r\n\r\n                   REFUSING THE SLIGHTEST DEPARTURE\r\n                             FROM VERACITY,\r\n                   EVEN TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A SISTER,\r\n\r\n                      SHE NEVERTHELESS SHOWED HER\r\n                        KINDNESS AND FORTITUDE,\r\n             IN RESCUING HER FROM THE SEVERITY OF THE LAW\r\n                 AT THE EXPENSE OF PERSONAL EXERTIONS\r\n                 WHICH THE TIME RENDERED AS DIFFICULT\r\n                      AS THE MOTIVE WAS LAUDABLE.\r\n\r\n                     RESPECT THE GRAVE OF POVERTY\r\n                   WHEN COMBINED WITH LOVE OF TRUTH\r\n                          AND DEAR AFFECTION.\r\n\r\n                        _Erected October 1831._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE C.--THE OLD TOLBOOTH.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Tolbooth of Edinburgh, Situated as described in this CHAPTER,\r\nwas built by the citizens in 1561, and destined for the accommodation of\r\nParliament, as well as of the High Courts of Justice;* and at the same\r\ntime for the confinement of prisoners for debt, or on criminal charges.\r\nSince the year 1640, when the present Parliament House was erected, the\r\nTolbooth was occupied as a prison only.\r\n\r\n* [This is not so certain. Few persons now living are likely to remember\r\nthe interior  of the old Tolbooth, with narrow staircase, thick walls,\r\nand small apartments,  nor to imagine that it could ever have been used\r\nfor these purposes. Robert Chambers,  in his _Minor Antiquities_ of\r\nEdinburgh, has preserved ground-plans or sections,  which clearly show\r\nthis,--the largest hall was on the second floor, and measuring 27  feet\r\nby 20, and 12 feet high. It may have been intended for the meetings of\r\nTown  Council, while the Parliament assembled, after 1560, in what was\r\ncalled the Upper  Tolbooth, that is the south-west portion of the\r\nCollegiate Church of St. Giles, until  the year 1640, when the present\r\nParliament House was completed. Being no  longer required for such a\r\npurpose, it was set apart by the Town Council on the  24th December 1641\r\nas a distinct church, with the name of the Tolbooth parish,  and\r\ntherefore could not have derived the name from its vicinity to the\r\nTolbooth, as  usually stated.]\r\n\r\nGloomy and dismal as it was, the situation in the centre of the High\r\nStreet rendered it so particularly well-aired, that when the plague laid\r\nwaste the city in 1645, it affected none within these melancholy\r\nprecincts. The Tolbooth was removed, with the mass of buildings in which\r\nit was incorporated, in the autumn of the year 1817. At that time the\r\nkindness of his old schoolfellow and friend, Robert Johnstone, Esquire,\r\nthen Dean of Guild of the city, with the liberal acquiescence of the\r\npersons who had contracted for the work, procured for the Author of\r\nWaverley the stones which composed the gateway, together with the door,\r\nand its ponderous fastenings, which he employed in decorating the\r\nentrance of his kitchen-court at Abbotsford. \xe2\x80\x9cTo such base offices may we\r\nreturn.\xe2\x80\x9d The application of these relies of the Heart of Mid-Lothian to\r\nserve as the postern-gate to a court of modern offices, may be justly\r\nridiculed as whimsical; but yet it is not without interest, that we see\r\nthe gateway through which so much of the stormy politics of a rude age,\r\nand the vice and misery of later times, had found their passage, now\r\noccupied in the service of rural economy. Last year, to complete the\r\nchange, a tomtit was pleased to build her nest within the lock of the\r\nTolbooth,--a strong temptation to have committed a sonnet, had the\r\nAuthor, like Tony Lumpkin, been in a concatenation accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning, that an act of beneficence celebrated the\r\ndemolition of the Heart of Mid-Lothian. A subscription, raised and\r\napplied by the worthy Magistrate above mentioned, procured the\r\nmanumission of most of the unfortunate debtors confined in the old jail,\r\nso that there were few or none transferred to the new place of\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\n[The figure of a Heart upon the pavement between St. Giles\xc3\xads Church and\r\nthe Edinburgh County Hall, now marks the site of the Old Tolbooth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE D--THE PORTEOUS MOB.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting and authentic account of the inquiries made by\r\nCrown Counsel into the affair of the Porteous Mob, seems to have been\r\ndrawn up by the Solicitor-General. The office was held in 1737 by Charles\r\nErskine, Esq.\r\n\r\nI owe this curious illustration to the kindness of a professional friend.\r\nIt throws, indeed, little light on the origin of the tumult; but shows\r\nhow profound the darkness must have been, which so much investigation\r\ncould not dispel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon the 7th of September last, when the unhappy wicked murder of\r\nCaptain Porteus was committed, His Majesty\xc3\xads Advocate and Solicitor were\r\nout of town; the first beyond Inverness, and the other in Annandale, not\r\nfar from Carlyle; neither of them knew anything of the reprieve, nor did\r\nthey in the least suspect that any disorder was to happen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the disorder happened, the magistrates and other persons concerned\r\nin the management of the town, seemed to be all struck of a heap; and\r\nwhether, from the great terror that had seized all the inhabitants, they\r\nthought ane immediate enquiry would be fruitless, or whether, being a\r\ndirect insult upon the prerogative of the crown, they did not care rashly\r\nto intermeddle; but no proceedings was had by them. Only, soon after, ane\r\nexpress was sent to his Majestie\xc3\xads Solicitor, who came to town as soon as\r\nwas possible for him; but, in the meantime, the persons who had been most\r\nguilty, had either ran off, or, at least, kept themselves upon the wing\r\nuntil they should see what steps were taken by the Government.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Solicitor arrived, he perceived the whole inhabitants under a\r\nconsternation. He had no materials furnished him; nay, the inhabitants\r\nwere so much afraid of being reputed informers, that very few people had\r\nso much as the courage to speak with him on the streets. However, having\r\nreceived her Majestie\xc3\xads orders, by a letter from the Duke of New castle,\r\nhe resolved to sett about the matter in earnest, and entered upon ane\r\nenquiry, gropeing in the dark. He had no assistance from the magistrates\r\nworth mentioning, but called witness after witness in the privatest\r\nmanner, before himself in his own house, and for six weeks time, from\r\nmorning to evening, went on in the enquiry without taking the least\r\ndiversion, or turning his thoughts to any other business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe tried at first what he could do by declarations, by engaging secresy,\r\nso that those who told the truth should never be discovered; made use of\r\nno clerk, but wrote all the declarations with his own hand, to encourage\r\nthem to speak out. After all, for some time, he could get nothing but\r\nends of stories which, when pursued, broke off; and those who appeared\r\nand knew anything of the matter, were under the utmost terror, lest it\r\nshould take air that they had mentioned any one man as guilty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the course of the enquiry, the run of the town, which was strong\r\nfor the villanous actors, begun to alter a little, and when they saw the\r\nKing\xc3\xads servants in earnest to do their best, the generality, who before\r\nhad spoke very warmly in defence of the wickedness, began to be silent,\r\nand at that period more of the criminals began to abscond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length the enquiry began to open a little, and the Sollicitor was\r\nunder some difficulty how to proceed. He very well saw that the first\r\nwarrand that was issued out would start the whole gang; and as he had not\r\ncome at any of the most notorious offenders, he was unwilling, upon the\r\nslight evidence he had, to begin. However, upon notice given him by\r\nGenerall Moyle, that one King, a butcher in the Canongate, had boasted,\r\nin presence of Bridget Knell, a soldier\xc3\xads wife, the morning after Captain\r\nPorteus was hanged, that he had a very active hand in the mob, a warrand\r\nwas issued out, and King was apprehended, and imprisoned in the Canongate\r\nTolbooth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis obliged the Sollicitor immediately to take up those against whom he\r\nhad any information. By a signed declaration, William Stirling,\r\napprentice to James Stirling, merchant in Edinburgh, was charged as\r\nhaveing been at the Nether-Bow, after the gates were shutt, with a\r\nLochaber-ax or halbert in his hand, and haveing begun a huzza, marched\r\nupon the head of the mob towards the Guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJames Braidwood, son to a candlemaker in town, was, by a signed\r\ndeclaration, charged as haveing been at the Tolbooth door, giveing\r\ndirections to the mob about setting fire to the door, and that the mob\r\nnamed him by his name, and asked his advice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy another declaration, one Stoddart, a journeyman smith, was charged of\r\nhaving boasted publickly, in a smith\xc3\xads shop at Leith, that he had\r\nassisted in breaking open the Tolbooth door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Traill, a journeyman wright, (by one of the declarations) was also\r\naccused of haveing lockt the Nether-Bow Port, when it was shutt by the\r\nmob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Majestie\xc3\xads Sollicitor having these informations, implored privately\r\nsuch persons as he could best rely on, and the truth was, there were very\r\nfew in whom he could repose confidence. But he was, indeed, faithfully\r\nserved by one Webster, a soldier in the Welsh fuzileers, recommended him\r\nby Lieutenant Alshton, who, with very great address, informed himself,\r\nand really run some risque in getting his information, concerning the\r\nplaces where the persons informed against used to haunt, and how they\r\nmight be seized. In consequence of which, a party of the Guard from the\r\nCanongate was agreed on to march up at a certain hour, when a message\r\nshould be sent. The Sollicitor wrote a letter and gave it to one of the\r\ntown officers, ordered to attend Captain Maitland, one of the town\r\nCaptains, promoted to that command since the unhappy accident, who,\r\nindeed, was extremely diligent and active throughout the whole; and\r\nhaveing got Stirling and Braidwood apprehended, dispatched the officer\r\nwith the letter to the military in the Canongate, who immediately begun\r\ntheir march, and by the time the Sollicitor had half examined the said\r\ntwo persons in the Burrow-room, where the Magistrates were present, a\r\nparty of fifty men, drums beating, marched into the Parliament close, and\r\ndrew up, which was the first thing that struck a terror, and from that\r\ntime forward, the insolence was succeeded by fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStirling and Braidwood were immediately sent to the Castle and\r\nimprisoned. That same night, Stoddart, the smith, was seized, and he was\r\ncommitted to the Castle also; as was likewise Traill, the journeyman\r\nwright, who were all severally examined, and denyed the least accession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, the enquiry was going on, and it haveing cast up in one\r\nof the declarations, that a hump\xc3\xadd backed creature marched with a gun as\r\none of the guards to Porteus when he went up to the Lawn Markett, the\r\nperson who emitted this declaration was employed to walk the streets to\r\nsee if he could find him out; at last he came to the Sollicitor and told\r\nhim he had found him, and that he was in a certain house. Whereupon a\r\nwarrand was issued out against him, and he was apprehended and sent to\r\nthe Castle, and he proved to be one Birnie, a helper to the Countess of\r\nWeemys\xc3\xads coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThereafter, ane information was given in against William M\xc3\xadLauchlan,\r\nffootman to the said Countess, he haveing been very active in the mob;\r\nffor sometime he kept himself out of the way, but at last he was\r\napprehended and likewise committed to the Castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these were all the prisoners who were putt under confinement in that\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were other persons imprisoned in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, and\r\nseveralls against whom warrands were issued, but could not be\r\napprehended, whose names and cases shall afterwards be more particularly\r\ntaken notice of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ffriends of Stirling made an application to the Earl of Islay, Lord\r\nJustice-Generall, setting furth, that he was seized with a bloody fflux;\r\nthat his life was in danger; and that upon ane examination of witnesses\r\nwhose names were given in, it would appear to conviction, that he had not\r\nthe least access to any of the riotous proceedings of that wicked mob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis petition was by his Lordship putt in the hands of his Majestie\xc3\xads\r\nSollicitor, who examined the witnesses; and by their testimonies it\r\nappeared, that the young man, who was not above eighteen years of age,\r\nwas that night in company with about half a dozen companions, in a public\r\nhouse in Stephen Law\xc3\xads closs, near the back of the Guard, where they all\r\nremained untill the noise came to the house, that the mob had shut the\r\ngates and seized the Guard, upon which the company broke up, and he, and\r\none of his companions, went towards his master\xc3\xads house; and, in the\r\ncourse of the after examination, there was a witness who declared, nay,\r\nindeed swore (for the Sollicitor, by this time, saw it necessary to put\r\nthose he examined upon oath), that he met him [Stirling] after he entered\r\ninto the alley where his master lives, going towards his house; and\r\nanother witness, fellow-prentice with Stirling, declares, that after the\r\nmob had seized the Guard, he went home, where he found Stirling before\r\nhim; and, that his master lockt the door, and kept them both at home till\r\nafter twelve at night: upon weighing of which testimonies, and upon\r\nconsideration had, That he was charged by the declaration only of one\r\nperson, who really did not appear to be a witness of the greatest weight,\r\nand that his life was in danger from the imprisonment, he was admitted to\r\nbaill by the Lord Justice-Generall, by whose warrand he was committed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBraidwood\xc3\xads friends applyed in the same manner; but as he stood charged\r\nby more than one witness, he was not released--tho\xc3\xad, indeed, the\r\nwitnesses adduced for him say somewhat in his exculpation--that he does\r\nnot seem to have been upon any original concert; and one of the witnesses\r\nsays he was along with him at the Tolbooth door, and refuses what is said\r\nagainst him, with regard to his having advised the burning of the\r\nTolbooth door. But he remains still in prison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to Traill, the journeyman wright, he is charged by the same witness\r\nwho declared against Stirling, and there is none concurrs with him and,\r\nto say the truth concerning him, he seemed to be the most ingenuous of\r\nany of them whom the Solicitor examined, and pointed out a witness by\r\nwhom one of the first accomplices was discovered, and who escaped when\r\nthe warrand was to be putt in execution against them. He positively denys\r\nhis having shutt the gate, and \xc3\xabtis thought Traill ought to be admitted\r\nto baill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to Birnie, he is charged only by one witness, who had never seen him\r\nbefore, nor knew his name; so, tho\xc3\xad I dare say the witness honestly\r\nmentioned him, \xc3\xabtis possible he may be mistaken; and in the examination\r\nof above 200 witnesses there is no body concurrs with him, and he is ane\r\ninsignificant little creature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith regard to M\xc3\xadLauchlan, the proof is strong against him by one\r\nwitness, that he acted as a serjeant, or sort of commander, for some\r\ntime, of a Guard, that stood cross between the upper end of the\r\nLuckenbooths and the north side of the street, to stop all but friends\r\nfrom going towards the Tolbooth; and by other witnesses, that he was at\r\nthe Tolbooth door with a link in his hand, while the operation of beating\r\nand burning it was going on; that he went along with the mob with a\r\nhalbert in his hand, untill he came to the gallows stone in the\r\nGrassmarket, and that he stuck the halbert into the hole of the gallows\r\nstone: that afterwards he went in amongst the mob when Captain Porteus\r\nwas carried to the dyer\xc3\xads tree; so that the proof seems very heavy\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sum up this matter with regard to the prisoners in the Castle, \xc3\xabtis\r\nbelieved there is strong proof against M\xc3\xadLauchlan; there is also proof\r\nagainst Braidwood. But, as it consists only in emission of words said to\r\nhave been had by him while at the Tolbooth door, and that he is ane\r\ninsignificant pitifull creature, and will find people to swear heartily\r\nin his favours, \xc3\xabtis at best doubtfull whether a jury will be got to\r\ncondemn him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to those in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, John Crawford, who had for\r\nsome time been employed to ring the bells in the steeple of the New\r\nChurch of Edinburgh, being in company with a soldier accidentally, the\r\ndiscourse falling in concerning the Captain Porteus and his murder, as he\r\nappears to be a light-headed fellow, he said, that he knew people that\r\nwere more guilty than any that were putt in prison. Upon this\r\ninformation, Crawford was seized, and being examined, it appeared, that\r\nwhen the mob begun, as he was comeing down from the steeple, the mob took\r\nthe keys from him; that he was that night in several corners, and did\r\nindeed delate severall persons whom he saw there, and immediately\r\nwarrands were despatched, and it was found they had absconded and fled.\r\nBut there was no evidence against him of any kind. Nay, on the contrary,\r\nit appeared, that he had been with the Magistrates in Clerk\xc3\xads, the\r\nvintner\xc3\xads, relating to them what he had seen in the streets. Therefore,\r\nafter haveing detained him in prison ffor a very considerable time, his\r\nMajestie\xc3\xads Advocate and Sollicitor signed a warrand for his liberation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was also one James Wilson incarcerated in the said Tolbooth, upon\r\nthe declaration of one witness, who said he saw him on the streets with a\r\ngun; and there he remained for some time, in order to try if a concurring\r\nwitness could be found, or that he acted any part in the tragedy and\r\nwickedness. But nothing farther appeared against him; and being seized\r\nwith a severe sickness, he is, by a warrand signed by his Majestie\xc3\xads\r\nAdvocate and Sollicitor, liberated upon giveing sufficient baill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to King, enquiry was made, and the ffact comes out beyond all\r\nexception, that he was in the lodge at the Nether-Bow with Lindsay the\r\nwaiter, and several other people, not at all concerned in the mob. But\r\nafter the affair was over, he went up towards the guard, and having met\r\nwith Sandie the Turk and his wife, who escaped out of prison, they\r\nreturned to his house at the Abbey, and then \xc3\xabtis very possible he may\r\nhave thought fitt in his beer to boast of villany, in which he could not\r\npossibly have any share for that reason; he was desired to find baill and\r\nhe should be set at liberty. But he is a stranger and a fellow of very\r\nindifferent character, and \xc3\xabtis believed it won\xc3\xadt be easy for him to find\r\nbaill. Wherefore, it\xc3\xads thought he must be sett at liberty without it.\r\nBecause he is a burden upon the Government while kept in confinement, not\r\nbeing able to maintain himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is above is all that relates to persons in custody. But there are\r\nwarrands out against a great many other persons who had fled,\r\nparticularly against one William White, a journeyman baxter, who, by the\r\nevidence, appears to have been at the beginning of the mob, and to have\r\ngone along with the drum, from the West-Port to the Nether-Bow, and is\r\nsaid to have been one of those who attacked the guard, and probably was\r\nas deep as any one there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInformation was given that he was lurking at Falkirk, where he was born.\r\nWhereupon directions were sent to the Sheriff of the County, and a\r\nwarrand from his Excellency Generall Wade, to the commanding officers at\r\nStirling and Linlithgow, to assist, and all possible endeavours were used\r\nto catch hold of him, and \xc3\xabtis said he escaped very narrowly, having been\r\nconcealed in some outhouse; and the misfortune was, that those who were\r\nemployed in the search did not know him personally. Nor, indeed, was it\r\neasy to trust any of the acquaintances of so low, obscure a fellow with\r\nthe secret of the warrand to be putt in execution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was also strong evidence found against Robert Taylor, servant to\r\nWilliam and Charles Thomsons, periwig-makers, that he acted as ane\r\nofficer among the mob, and he was traced from the guard to the well at\r\nthe head of Forester\xc3\xads Wynd, where he stood and had the appellation of\r\nCaptain from the mob, and from that walking down the Bow before Captain\r\nPorteus, with his Lochaber axe; and, by the description given of one who\r\nhawl\xc3\xadd the rope by which Captain Porteus was pulled up, \xc3\xabtis believed\r\nTaylor was the person; and \xc3\xabtis farther probable, that the witness who\r\ndebated Stirling had mistaken Taylor for him, their stature and age (so\r\nfar as can be gathered from the description) being the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal of pains were taken, and no charge was saved, in order to\r\nhave catched hold of this Taylor, and warrands were sent to the country\r\nwhere he was born; but it appears he had shipt himself off for Holland,\r\nwhere it is said he now is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is strong evidence also against Thomas Burns, butcher, that he was\r\nane active person from the beginning of the mob to the end of it. He\r\nlurkt for some time amongst those of his trade; and artfully enough a\r\ntrain was laid to catch him, under pretence of a message that had come\r\nfrom his father in Ireland, so that he came to a blind alehouse in the\r\nFlesh-market close, and, a party being ready, was, by Webster the\r\nsoldier, who was upon this exploit, advertised to come down. However,\r\nBurns escaped out at a back-window, and hid himself in some of the houses\r\nwhich are heaped together upon one another in that place, so that it was\r\nnot possible to catch him. \xc3\xabTis now said he is gone to Ireland to his\r\nfather who lives there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is evidence also against one Robert Anderson, journeyman and\r\nservant to Colin Alison, wright; and against Thomas Linnen and James\r\nMaxwell, both servants also to the said Colin Alison, who all seem to\r\nhave been deeply concerned in the matter. Anderson is one of those who\r\nputt the rope upon Captain Porteus\xc3\xads neck. Linnen seems also to have been\r\nvery active; and Maxwell (which is pretty remarkable) is proven to have\r\ncome to a shop upon the Friday before, and charged the journeymen and\r\nprentices there to attend in the Parliament close on Tuesday night, to\r\nassist to hang Captain Porteus. These three did early abscond, and,\r\nthough warrands had been issued out against them, and all endeavours used\r\nto apprehend them, could not be found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne Waldie, a servant to George Campbell, wright, has also absconded,\r\nand many others, and \xc3\xabtis informed that numbers of them have shipt\r\nthemselves off ffor the Plantations; and upon an information that a ship\r\nwas going off ffrom Glasgow, in which severall of the rogues were to\r\ntransport themselves beyond seas, proper warrands were obtained, and\r\npersons despatched to search the said ship, and seize any that can be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe like warrands had been issued with regard to ships from Leith. But\r\nwhether they had been scard, or whether the information had been\r\ngroundless, they had no effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a summary of the enquiry, ffrom which it appears there is no\r\nprooff on which one can rely, but against M\xc3\xadLauchlan. There is a prooff\r\nalso against Braidwood, but more exceptionable. His Majestie\xc3\xads Advocate,\r\nsince he came to town, has join\xc3\xadd with the Sollicitor, and has done his\r\nutmost to gett at the bottom of this matter, but hitherto it stands as is\r\nabove represented. They are resolved to have their eyes and their ears\r\nopen, and to do what they can. But they laboured exceedingly against the\r\nstream; and it may truly be said, that nothing was wanting on their part.\r\nNor have they declined any labour to answer the commands laid upon them\r\nto search the matter to the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTEOUS MOB.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding\r\nCHAPTERs (I. to VI.) the circumstances of that\r\nextraordinary riot and conspiracy, called the Porteous Mob, are given\r\nwith as much accuracy as the author was able to collect them. The order,\r\nregularity, and determined resolution with which such a violent action\r\nwas devised and executed, were only equalled by the secrecy which was\r\nobserved concerning the principal actors.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fact was performed by torch-light, and in presence of a\r\ngreat multitude, to some of whom, at least, the individual actors must\r\nhave been known, yet no discovery was ever made concerning any of the\r\nperpetrators of the slaughter.\r\n\r\nTwo men only were brought to trial for an offence which the Government\r\nwere so anxious to detect and punish. William M\xc3\xadLauchlan, footman to the\r\nCountess of Wemyss, who is mentioned in the report of the\r\nSolicitor-General, against whom strong evidence had been obtained, was\r\nbrought to trial in March 1737, charged as having been accessory to the\r\nriot, armed with a Lochaber axe. But this man (who was at all times a\r\nsilly creature) proved, that he was in a state of mortal intoxication\r\nduring the time he was present with the rabble, incapable of giving them\r\neither advice or assistance, or, indeed, of knowing what he or they were\r\ndoing. He was also able to prove, that he was forced into the riot, and\r\nupheld while there by two bakers, who put a Lochaber axe into his hand.\r\nThe jury, wisely judging this poor creature could be no proper subject of\r\npunishment, found the panel Not Guilty. The same verdict was given in the\r\ncase of Thomas Linning, also mentioned in the Solicitor\xc3\xads memorial, who\r\nwas tried in 1738. In short, neither then, nor for a long period\r\nafterwards, was anything discovered relating to the organisation of the\r\nPorteous Plot.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of the people of Edinburgh was long irritated, and their\r\ncuriosity kept awake, by the mystery attending this extraordinary\r\nconspiracy. It was generally reported of such natives of Edinburgh as,\r\nhaving left the city in youth, returned with a fortune amassed in foreign\r\ncountries, that they had originally fled on account of their share in the\r\nPorteous Mob. But little credit can be attached to these surmises, as in\r\nmost of the cases they are contradicted by dates, and in none supported\r\nby anything but vague rumours, grounded on the ordinary wish of the\r\nvulgar, to impute the success of prosperous men to some unpleasant\r\nsource. The secret history of the Porteous Mob has been till this day\r\nunravelled; and it has always been quoted as a close, daring, and\r\ncalculated act of violence, of a nature peculiarly characteristic of the\r\nScottish people.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the author, for a considerable time, nourished hopes to\r\nhave found himself enabled to throw some light on this mysterious story.\r\nAn old man, who died about twenty years ago, at the advanced age of\r\nninety-three, was said to have made a communication to the clergyman who\r\nattended upon his death-bed, respecting the origin of the Porteous Mob.\r\nThis person followed the trade of a carpenter, and had been employed as\r\nsuch on the estate of a family of opulence and condition. His character\r\nin his line of life and amongst his neighbours, was excellent, and never\r\nunderwent the slightest suspicion. His confession was said to have been\r\nto the following purpose: That he was one of twelve young men belonging\r\nto the village of Pathhead, whose animosity against Porteous, on account\r\nof the execution of Wilson, was so extreme, that they resolved to execute\r\nvengeance on him with their own hands, rather than he should escape\r\npunishment. With this resolution they crossed the Forth at different\r\nferries, and rendezvoused at the suburb called Portsburgh, where their\r\nappearance in a body soon called numbers around them. The public mind was\r\nin such a state of irritation, that it only wanted a single spark to\r\ncreate an explosion; and this was afforded by the exertions of the small\r\nand determined band of associates. The appearance of premeditation and\r\norder which distinguished the riot, according to his account, had its\r\norigin, not in any previous plan or conspiracy, but in the character of\r\nthose who were engaged in it. The story also serves to show why nothing\r\nof the origin of the riot has ever been discovered, since though in\r\nitself a great conflagration, its source, according to this account, was\r\nfrom an obscure and apparently inadequate cause.\r\n\r\nI have been disappointed, however, in obtaining the evidence on which\r\nthis story rests. The present proprietor of the estate on which the old\r\nman died (a particular friend of the author) undertook to question the\r\nson of the deceased on the subject. This person follows his father\xc3\xads\r\ntrade, and holds the employment of carpenter to the same family. He\r\nadmits that his father\xc3\xads going abroad at the time of the Porteous Mob was\r\npopularly attributed to his having been concerned in that affair; but\r\nadds that, so far as is known to him, the old man had never made any\r\nconfession to that effect; and, on the contrary, had uniformly denied\r\nbeing present. My kind friend, therefore, had recourse to a person from\r\nwhom he had formerly heard the story; but who, either from respect to an\r\nold friend\xc3\xads memory, or from failure of his own, happened to have\r\nforgotten that ever such a communication was made. So my obliging\r\ncorrespondent (who is a fox-hunter) wrote to me that he was completely\r\n_planted;_ and all that can be said with respect to the tradition is,\r\nthat it certainly once existed, and was generally believed.\r\n\r\n[_N.B._--The Rev. Dr. Carlyle, minister of Inveresk, in his\r\n_Autobiography,_ gives some interesting particulars relating to the\r\nPorteous Mob, from personal recollections. He happened to be present in\r\nthe Tolbooth Church when Robertson made his escape, and also at the\r\nexecution of Wilson in the Grassmarket, when Captain Porteous fired upon\r\nthe mob, and several persons were killed.

The next morning, one of his elders coming to\r\nsee him, and lamenting his great loss and want of rest, he replied,--\xc3\xabI\r\ndeclare I have not, all night, had one thought of the death of my wife, I\r\nhave been so taken up in meditating on heavenly things. I have been this\r\nnight on the banks of Ulai, plucking an apple here and there.\xc3\xad\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n_Walker\xc3\xads Remarkable Passages of the Life and Death of Mr. John Semple._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE F.--PETER WALKER.\r\n\r\nThis personage, whom it would be base ingratitude in the author to pass\r\nover without some notice, was by far the most zealous and faithful\r\ncollector and recorder of the actions and opinions of the Cameronians. He\r\nresided, while stationary, at the Bristo Port of Edinburgh, but was by\r\ntrade an itinerant merchant, or pedlar, which profession he seems to have\r\nexercised in Ireland as well as Britain. He composed biographical notices\r\nof Alexander Peden, John Semple, John Welwood, and Richard Cameron, all\r\nministers of the Cameronian persuasion, to which the last mentioned\r\nmember gave the name.\r\n\r\nIt is from such tracts as these, written in the sense, feeling, and\r\nspirit of the sect, and not from the sophisticated narratives of a later\r\nperiod, that the real character of the persecuted class is to be\r\ngathered. Walker writes with a simplicity which sometimes slides into the\r\nburlesque, and sometimes attains a tone of simple pathos, but always\r\nexpressing the most daring confidence in his own correctness of creed and\r\nsentiments, sometimes with narrow-minded and disgusting bigotry. His turn\r\nfor the marvellous was that of his time and sect; but there is little\r\nroom to doubt his veracity concerning whatever he quotes on his own\r\nknowledge. His small tracts now bring a very high price, especially the\r\nearlier and authentic editions. The tirade against dancing, pronounced by\r\nDavid Deans, is, as intimated in the text, partly borrowed from Peter\r\nWalker. He notices, as a foul reproach upon the name of Richard Cameron,\r\nthat his memory was vituperated, \xe2\x80\x9cby pipers and fiddlers playing the\r\nCameronian march--carnal vain springs, which too many professors of\r\nreligion dance to; a practice unbecoming the professors of Christianity\r\nto dance to any spring, but somewhat more to this. Whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nproceeds, \xe2\x80\x9cbe the many foul blots recorded of the saints in Scripture,\r\nnone of them is charged with this regular fit of distraction. We find it\r\nhas been practised by the wicked and profane, as the dancing at that\r\nbrutish, base action of the calf-making; and it had been good for that\r\nunhappy lass, who danced off the head of John the Baptist, that she had\r\nbeen born a cripple, and never drawn a limb to her. Historians say, that\r\nher sin was written upon her judgment, who some time thereafter was\r\ndancing upon the ice, and it broke, and snapt the head off her; her head\r\ndanced above, and her feet beneath. There is ground to think and\r\nconclude, that when the world\xc3\xads wickedness was great, dancing at their\r\nmarriages was practised; but when the heavens above, and the earth\r\nbeneath, were let loose upon them with that overflowing flood, their\r\nmirth was soon staid; and when the Lord in holy justice rained fire and\r\nbrimstone from heaven upon that wicked people and city Sodom, enjoying\r\nfulness of bread and idleness, their fiddle-strings and hands went all in\r\na flame; and the whole people in thirty miles of length, and ten of\r\nbreadth, as historians say, were all made to fry in their skins and at\r\nthe end, whoever are giving in marriages and dancing when all will go in\r\na flame, they will quickly change their note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often wondered thorow my life, how any that ever knew what it was\r\nto bow a knee in earnest to pray, durst crook a hough to fyke and fling\r\nat a piper\xc3\xads and fiddler\xc3\xads springs. I bless the Lord that ordered my lot\r\nso in my dancing days, that made the fear of the bloody rope and bullets\r\nto my neck and head, the pain of boots, thumikens, and irons, cold and\r\nhunger, wetness and weariness, to stop the lightness of my head, and the\r\nwantonness of my feet. What the never-to-be-forgotten Man of God, John\r\nKnox, said to Queen Mary, when she gave him that sharp challenge, which\r\nwould strike our mean-spirited, tongue-tacked ministers dumb, for his\r\ngiving public faithful warning of the danger of the church and nation,\r\nthrough her marrying the Dauphine of France, when he left her bubbling\r\nand greeting, and came to an outer court, where her Lady Maries were\r\nfyking and dancing, he said, \xc3\xabO brave ladies, a brave world, if it would\r\nlast, and heaven at the hinder end! But fye upon the knave Death, that\r\nwill seize upon those bodies of yours; and where will all your fiddling\r\nand flinging be then?\xc3\xad Dancing being such a common evil, especially\r\namongst young professors, that all the lovers of the Lord should hate,\r\nhas caused me to insist the more upon it, especially that foolish spring\r\nthe Cameronian march!\xe2\x80\x9d--_Life and Death of Three Famous Worthies,_ etc.,\r\ncollected and printed for Patrick Walker, Edin. 1727, 12mo, p. 59.\r\n\r\nIt may be here observed, that some of the milder class of Cameronians\r\nmade a distinction between the two sexes dancing separately, and allowed\r\nof it as a healthy and not unlawful exercise; but when men and women\r\nmingled in sport, it was then called _promiscuous dancing,_ and\r\nconsidered as a scandalous enormity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE G.--MUSCHAT\xc3\xadS CAIRN.\r\n\r\nNichol Muschat, a debauched and profligate wretch, having conceived a\r\nhatred against his wife, entered into a conspiracy with another brutal\r\nlibertine and gambler, named Campbell of Burnbank (repeatedly mentioned\r\nin Pennycuick\xc3\xads satirical poems of the time), by which Campbell undertook\r\nto destroy the woman\xc3\xads character, so as to enable Muschat, on false\r\npretences to obtain a divorce from her. The brutal devices to which these\r\nworthy accomplices resorted for that purpose having failed, they\r\nendeavoured to destroy her by administering medicine of a dangerous kind,\r\nand in extraordinary quantities.\r\n\r\nThis purpose also failing, Nichol Muschat, or Muschet, did finally, on\r\nthe 17th October 1720, carry his wife under cloud of night to the King\xc3\xads\r\nPark, adjacent to what is called the Duke\xc3\xads Walk, near Holyrood Palace,\r\nand there took her life by cutting her throat almost quite through, and\r\ninflicting other wounds. He pleaded guilty to the indictment, for which\r\nhe suffered death. His associate, Campbell, was sentenced to\r\ntransportation, for his share in the previous conspiracy. See\r\n_MacLaurin\xc3\xads Criminal Cases,_pp. 64 and 738.\r\n\r\nIn memory, and at the same time execration, of the deed, a _cairn,_ or\r\npile of stones, long marked the spot.

The\r\nexpression _lock,_ for a small quantity of any readily divisible dry\r\nsubstance, as corn, meal, flax, or the like, is still preserved, not only\r\npopularly, but in a legal description, as the _lock_ and _gowpen,_ or\r\nsmall quantity and handful, payable in thirlage cases, as in town\r\nmulture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I.--THE FAIRY BOY OF LEITH,\r\n\r\nThis legend was in former editions inaccurately said to exist in Baxter\xc3\xads\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorld of Spirits;\xe2\x80\x9d but is, in fact, to be found, in \xe2\x80\x9cPandaemonium, or\r\nthe Devil\xc3\xads Cloyster; being a further blow to Modern Sadduceism,\xe2\x80\x9d by\r\nRichard Bovet, Gentleman, 12mo, 1684. The work is inscribed to Dr. Henry\r\nMore. The story is entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cA remarkable passage of one named the Fairy\r\nBoy of Leith, in Scotland, given me by my worthy friend, Captain George\r\nBurton, and attested under his hand;\xe2\x80\x9d and is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout fifteen years since, having business that detained me for some\r\ntime in Leith, which is near Edenborough, in the kingdom of Scotland, I\r\noften met some of my acquaintance at a certain house there, where we used\r\nto drink a glass of wine for our refection. The woman which kept the\r\nhouse was of honest reputation amongst the neighbours, which made me\r\ngive the more attention to what she told me one day about a Fairy Boy (as\r\nthey called him) who lived about that town. She had given me so strange\r\nan account of him, that I desired her I might see him the first\r\nopportunity, which she promised; and not long after, passing that way,\r\nshe told me there was the Fairy Boy but a little before I came by; and\r\ncasting her eye into the street, said, \xc3\xabLook you, sir, yonder he is at\r\nplay with those other boys,\xc3\xad and designing him to me. I went, and by\r\nsmooth words, and a piece of money, got him to come into the house with\r\nme; where, in the presence of divers people, I demanded of him several\r\nastrological questions, which he answered with great subtility, and\r\nthrough all his discourse carried it with a cunning much beyond his\r\nyears, which seemed not to exceed ten or eleven. He seemed to make a\r\nmotion like drumming upon the table with his fingers, upon which I asked\r\nhim, whether he could beat a drum, to which he replied, \xc3\xabYes, sir, as\r\nwell as any man in Scotland; for every Thursday night I beat all points\r\nto a sort of people that use to meet under yon hill\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to the\r\ngreat hill between Edenborough and Leith). \xc3\xabHow, boy,\xc3\xad quoth I; \xc3\xabwhat\r\ncompany have you there?\xc3\xad--\xc3\xabThere are, sir,\xc3\xad said he, \xc3\xaba great company\r\nboth of men and women, and they are entertained with many sorts of music\r\nbesides my drum; they have, besides, plenty variety of meats and wine;\r\nand many times we are carried into France or Holland in a night, and\r\nreturn again; and whilst we are there, we enjoy all the pleasures the\r\ncountry doth afford.\xc3\xad I demanded of him, how they got under that hill?\r\nTo which he replied, \xc3\xabthat there were a great pair of gates that opened\r\nto them, though they were invisible to others, and that within there were\r\nbrave large rooms, as well accommodated as most in Scotland.\xc3\xad I then\r\nasked him, how I should know what he said to be true? upon which he told\r\nme he would read my fortune, saying I should have two wives, and that he\r\nsaw the forms of them sitting on my shoulders; that both would be very\r\nhandsome women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs he was thus speaking, a woman of the neighbourhood, coming into the\r\nroom, demanded of him what her fortune should be? He told her that she\r\nhad two bastards before she was married; which put her in such a rage,\r\nthat she desired not to hear the rest. The woman of the house told me\r\nthat all the people in Scotland could not keep him from the rendezvous on\r\nThursday night; upon which, by promising him some more money, I got a\r\npromise of him to meet me at the same place, in the afternoon of the\r\nThursday following, and so dismissed him at that time. The boy came again\r\nat the place and time appointed, and I had prevailed with some friends to\r\ncontinue with me, if possible, to prevent his moving that night; he was\r\nplaced between us, and answered many questions, without offering to go\r\nfrom us, until about eleven of the clock, he was got away unperceived of\r\nthe company; but I suddenly missing him, hasted to the door, and took\r\nhold of him, and so returned him into the same room; we all watched him,\r\nand on a sudden he was again out of the doors. I followed him close, and\r\nhe made a noise in the street as if he had been set upon; but from that\r\ntime I could never see him.\r\n                                        \xe2\x80\x9cGEORGE BURTON.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[A copy of this rare little volume is in the library at Abbotsford.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE J.--INTERCOURSE OF THE COVENANTERS WITH THE INVISIBLE WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy, dangerous, and constant wanderings of the persecuted sect of\r\nCameronians, naturally led to their entertaining with peculiar credulity\r\nthe belief that they were sometimes persecuted, not only by the wrath of\r\nmen, but by the secret wiles and open terrors of Satan. In fact, a flood\r\ncould not happen, a horse cast a shoe, or any other the most ordinary\r\ninterruption thwart a minister\xc3\xads wish to perform service at a particular\r\nspot, than the accident was imputed to the immediate agency of fiends.\r\nThe encounter of Alexander Peden with the Devil in the cave, and that of\r\nJohn Sample with the demon in the ford, are given by Peter Walker almost\r\nin the language of the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE K.--CHILD-MURDER.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Statute Book, anno 1690,\r\nCHAPTER 21, in consequence of the\r\ngreat increase of the crime of child-murder, both from the temptations to\r\ncommit the offence and the difficulty of discovery enacted a certain set\r\nof presumptions, which, in the absence of direct proof, the jury were\r\ndirected to receive as evidence of the crime having actually been\r\ncommitted. The circumstances selected for this purpose were, that the\r\nwoman should have concealed her situation during the whole period of\r\npregnancy; that she should not have called for help at her delivery; and\r\nthat, combined with these grounds of suspicion, the child should be\r\neither found dead or be altogether missing. Many persons suffered death\r\nduring the last century under this severe act. But during the author\xc3\xads\r\nmemory a more lenient course was followed, and the female accused under\r\nthe act, and conscious of no competent defence, usually lodged a petition\r\nto the Court of Justiciary, denying, for form\xc3\xads sake, the tenor of the\r\nindictment, but stating, that as her good name had been destroyed by the\r\ncharge, she was willing to submit to sentence of banishment, to which the\r\ncrown counsel usually consented. This lenity in practice, and the\r\ncomparative infrequency of the crime since the doom of public\r\necclesiastical penance has been generally dispensed with, have led to the\r\nabolition of the Statute of William, and Mary, which is now replaced by\r\nanother, imposing banishment in those circumstances in which the crime\r\nwas formerly capital. This alteration took place in 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE L.--CALUMNIATOR OF THE FAIR SEX.\r\n\r\nThe journal of Graves, a Bow Street officer, despatched to Holland to\r\nobtain the surrender of the unfortunate William Brodie, bears a\r\nreflection on the ladies somewhat like that put in the mouth of the\r\npolice-officer Sharpitlaw. It had been found difficult to identify the\r\nunhappy criminal; and when a Scotch gentleman of respectability had\r\nseemed disposed to give evidence on the point required, his son-in-law, a\r\nclergyman in Amsterdam, and his daughter, were suspected by Graves to\r\nhave used arguments with the witness to dissuade him from giving his\r\ntestimony. On which subject the journal of the Bow Street officer\r\nproceeds thus:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaw then a manifest reluctance in Mr. -------, and had no doubt the\r\ndaughter and parson would endeavour to persuade him to decline troubling\r\nhimself in the matter, but judged he could not go back from what he had\r\nsaid to Mr. Rich.--Nota Bene. _No mischief but a woman or a priest in\r\nit_--here both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE M.--Sir William Dick of Braid.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman formed a striking example of the instability of human\r\nprosperity. He was once the wealthiest man of his time in Scotland, a\r\nmerchant in an extensive line of commerce, and a farmer of the public\r\nrevenue; insomuch that, about 1640, he estimated his fortune at two\r\nhundred thousand pounds sterling. Sir William Dick was a zealous\r\nCovenanter; and in the memorable year 1641, he lent the Scottish\r\nConvention of Estates one hundred thousand merks at once, and thereby\r\nenabled them to support and pay their army, which must otherwise have\r\nbroken to pieces. He afterwards advanced L20,000 for the service of King\r\nCharles, during the usurpation; and having, by owning the royal cause,\r\nprovoked the displeasure of the ruling party, he was fleeced of more\r\nmoney, amounting in all to L65,000 sterling.\r\n\r\nBeing in this manner reduced to indigence, he went to London to try to\r\nrecover some part of the sums which had been lent on Government security.\r\nInstead of receiving any satisfaction, the Scottish Croesus was thrown\r\ninto prison, in which he died, 19th December 1655. It is said his death\r\nwas hastened by the want of common necessaries. But this statement is\r\nsomewhat exaggerated, if it be true, as is commonly said, that though he\r\nwas not supplied with bread, he had plenty of pie-crust, thence called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir William Dick\xc3\xads Necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe changes of fortune are commemorated in a folio pamphlet, entitled,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lamentable Estate and distressed Case of Sir William Dick\xe2\x80\x9d [Lond.\r\n1656]. It contains three copper-plates, one representing Sir William on\r\nhorseback, and attended with guards as Lord Provost of Edinburgh,\r\nsuperintending the unloading of one of his rich argosies. A second\r\nexhibiting him as arrested, and in the hands of the bailiffs. A third\r\npresents him dead in prison. The tract is esteemed highly valuable by\r\ncollectors of prints. The only copy I ever saw upon sale, was rated at\r\nL30. (In London sales, copies have varied in price from L15 to L52: 10s.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE N.--Doomster, or Dempster, of Court.\r\n\r\nThe name of this officer is equivalent to the pronouncer of doom or\r\nsentence. In this comprehensive sense, the Judges of the Isle of Man were\r\ncalled Dempsters. But in Scotland the word was long restricted to the\r\ndesignation of an official person, whose duty it was to recite the\r\nsentence after it had been pronounced by the Court, and recorded by the\r\nclerk; on which occasion the Dempster legalised it by the words of form,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_And this I pronounce for doom._\xe2\x80\x9d For a length of years, the office, as\r\nmentioned in the text, was held in commendam with that of the\r\nexecutioner; for when this odious but necessary officer of justice\r\nreceived his appointment, he petitioned the Court of Justiciary to be\r\nreceived as their Dempster, which was granted as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThe production of the executioner in open court, and in presence of the\r\nwretched criminal, had something in it hideous and disgusting to the more\r\nrefined feelings of later times. But if an old tradition of the\r\nParliament House of Edinburgh may be trusted, it was the following\r\nanecdote which occasioned the disuse of the Dempster\xc3\xads office.\r\n\r\nIt chanced at one time that the office of public executioner was vacant.\r\nThere was occasion for some one to act as Dempster, and, considering the\r\nparty who generally held the office, it is not wonderful that a locum\r\ntenens was hard to be found. At length, one Hume, who had been sentenced\r\nto transportation, for an attempt to burn his own house, was induced to\r\nconsent that he would pronounce the doom on this occasion. But when\r\nbrought forth to officiate, instead of repeating the doom to the\r\ncriminal, Mr. Hume addressed himself to their lordships in a bitter\r\ncomplaint of the injustice of his own sentence. It was in vain that he\r\nwas interrupted, and reminded of the purpose for which he had come\r\nhither; \xe2\x80\x9cI ken what ye want of me weel eneugh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cye want\r\nme to be your Dempster; but I am come to be none of your Dempster, I am\r\ncome to summon you, Lord T, and you, Lord E, to answer at the bar of\r\nanother world for the injustice you have done me in this.\xe2\x80\x9d In short, Hume\r\nhad only made a pretext of complying with the proposal, in order to have\r\nan opportunity of reviling the Judges to their faces, or giving them, in\r\nthe phrase of his country, \xe2\x80\x9ca sloan.\xe2\x80\x9d He was hurried off amid the\r\nlaughter of the audience, but the indecorous scene which had taken place\r\ncontributed to the abolition of the office of Dempster. The sentence is\r\nnow read over by the clerk of court, and the formality of pronouncing\r\ndoom is altogether omitted.\r\n\r\n[The usage of calling the Dempster into court by the ringing of a\r\nhand-bell, to repeat the sentence on a criminal, is said to have been\r\nabrogated in March 1773.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE O.--John Duke of Argyle and Greenwich.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman was very dear to his countrymen, who were justly proud of\r\nhis military and political talents, and grateful for the ready zeal with\r\nwhich he asserted the rights of his native country. This was never more\r\nconspicuous than in the matter of the Porteous Mob, when the ministers\r\nbrought in a violent and vindictive bill, for declaring the Lord Provost\r\nof Edinburgh incapable of bearing any public office in future, for not\r\nforeseeing a disorder which no one foresaw, or interrupting the course of\r\na riot too formidable to endure opposition. The same bill made provision\r\nfor pulling down the city gates, and abolishing the city guard,--rather a\r\nHibernian mode of enabling their better to keep the peace within burgh in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyle opposed this bill as a cruel, unjust, and fanatical\r\nproceeding, and an encroachment upon the privileges of the royal burghs\r\nof Scotland, secured to them by the treaty of Union. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all the\r\nproceedings of that time,\xe2\x80\x9d said his Grace, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nation of Scotland\r\ntreated with the English as a free and independent people; and as that\r\ntreaty, my Lords, had no other guarantee for the due performance of its\r\narticles, but the faith and honour of a British Parliament, it would be\r\nboth unjust and ungenerous, should this House agree to any proceedings\r\nthat have a tendency to injure it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Hardwicke, in reply to the Duke of Argyle, seemed to insinuate, that\r\nhis Grace had taken up the affair in a party point of view, to which the\r\nnobleman replied in the spirited language quoted in the text. Lord\r\nHardwicke apologised. The bill was much modified, and the clauses\r\nconcerning the dismantling the city, and disbanding the guard, were\r\ndeparted from. A fine of L2000 was imposed on the city for the benefit of\r\nPorteous\xc3\xads widow. She was contented to accept three-fourths of the sum,\r\nthe payment of which closed the transaction. It is remarkable, that, in\r\nour day, the Magistrates of Edinburgh have had recourse to both those\r\nmeasures, hold in such horror by their predecessors, as necessary steps\r\nfor the improvement of the city.\r\n\r\nIt may be here noticed, in explanation of another circumstance mentioned\r\nin the text, that there is a tradition in Scotland, that George II.,\r\nwhose irascible temper is said sometimes to have hurried him into\r\nexpressing his displeasure _par voie du fait,_ offered to the Duke of\r\nArgyle in angry audience, some menace of this nature, on which he left\r\nthe presence in high disdain, and with little ceremony. Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, having met the Duke as he retired, and learning the cause of his\r\nresentment and discomposure, endeavoured to reconcile him to what had\r\nhappened by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSuch was his Majesty\xc3\xads way, and that he often took\r\nsuch liberties with himself without meaning any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d This did not mend\r\nmatters in MacCallummore\xc3\xads eyes, who replied, in great disdain, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will\r\nplease to remember, Sir Robert, the infinite distance there is betwixt\r\nyou and me.\xe2\x80\x9d Another frequent expression of passion on the part of the\r\nsame monarch, is alluded to in the old Jacobite song--\r\n\r\n                   The fire shall get both hat and wig,\r\n                   As oft-times they\xc3\xadve got a\xc3\xad that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE P.--Expulsion of the Bishops from the Scottish Convention.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the Scottish Convention had commenced its sittings,\r\nthe Scottish prelates retained their seats, and said prayers by rotation\r\nto the meeting, until the character of the Convention became, through the\r\nsecession of Dundee, decidedly Presbyterian. Occasion was then taken on\r\nthe Bishop of Ross mentioning King James in his prayer, as him for whom\r\nthey watered their couch with tears. On this the Convention exclaimed,\r\nthey had no occasion for spiritual Lords, and commanded the Bishops to\r\ndepart and return no more, Montgomery of Skelmorley breaking at the same\r\ntime a coarse jest upon the scriptural expression used by the prelate.\r\nDavie Deans\xc3\xads oracle, Patrick Walker, gives this account of their\r\ndismission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they came out, some of the Convention said they wished the honest\r\nlads knew they were put out, for then they would not get away with haill\r\n(whole) gowns. All the fourteen gathered together with pale faces, and\r\nstood in a cloud in the Parliament Close; James Wilson, Robert Neilson,\r\nFrancis Hislop, and myself, were standing close by them; Francis Hislop\r\nwith force thrust Robert Neilson upon them, their heads went hard on one\r\nanother. But there being so many enemies in the city fretting and\r\ngnashing the teeth, waiting for an occasion to raise a mob, when\r\nundoubtedly blood would have been shed, and having laid down conclusions\r\namongst ourselves to avoid giving the least occasion to all mobs, kept us\r\nfrom tearing off their gowns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir graceless Graces went quickly off, and there was neither bishop\r\nnor curate seen in the street--this was a surprising sudden change not to\r\nbe forgotten. Some of us would have rejoiced near them in large sums to\r\nhave seen these Bishops sent legally down the Bow that they might have\r\nfound the weight of their tails in a tow to dry their tow-soles; that\r\nthey might know what hanging was, they having been active for themselves\r\nand the main instigators to all the mischiefs, cruelties, and bloodshed\r\nof that time, wherein the streets of Edinburgh and other places of the\r\nland did run with the innocent precious dear blood of the Lord\xc3\xads\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d--_Life and Death of three famous Worthies_ (Semple, etc.), by\r\nPatrick Walker. Edin. 1727, pp. 72, 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE Q.--Half-hanged Maggie Dickson.\r\n\r\n[In the Statistical Account of the Parish of Inveresk (vol. xvi. p. 34),\r\nDr. Carlyle says, \xe2\x80\x9cNo person has been convicted of a capital felony since\r\nthe year 1728, when the famous Maggy Dickson was condemned and executed\r\nfor child-murder in the Grassmarket of Edinburgh, and was restored to\r\nlife in a cart on her way to Musselburgh to be buried . . . . . She kept\r\nan ale-house in a neighbouring parish for many years after she came to\r\nlife again, which was much resorted to from curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d After the body\r\nwas cut down and handed over to her relatives, her revival is attributed\r\nto the jolting of the cart, and according to Robert Chambers,--taking a\r\nretired road to Musselburgh, \xe2\x80\x9cthey stopped near Peffer-mill to get a\r\ndram; and when they came out from the house to resume their journey,\r\nMaggie was sitting up in the cart.\xe2\x80\x9d Among the poems of Alexander\r\nPennecuick (who died in 1730), is one entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Merry Wives of\r\nMusselburgh\xc3\xads Welcome to Meg Dickson;\xe2\x80\x9d while another broadside, without\r\nany date or author\xc3\xads name, is called \xe2\x80\x9cMargaret Dickson\xc3\xads Penitential\r\nConfession,\xe2\x80\x9d containing these lines referring to her conviction:--\r\n\r\n             \xe2\x80\x9cWho found me guilty of that barbarous crime,\r\n              And did, by law, end this wretched life of mine;\r\n              But God . . . . did me preserve,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nIn another of these ephemeral productions hawked about the streets,\r\ncalled, \xe2\x80\x9cA Ballad by J--n B--s,\xe2\x80\x9d are the following lines:--\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cPlease peruse the speech\r\n                     Of ill-hanged Maggy Dickson.\r\n                  Ere she was strung, the wicked wife\r\n                  Was sainted by the Flamen (priest),\r\n                  But now, since she\xc3\xads retum\xc3\xadd to life,\r\n                     Some say she\xc3\xads the old samen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his reference to Maggie\xc3\xads calling salt after her recovery, the Author\r\nwould appear to be alluding to another character who went by the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csaut _Maggie,_\xe2\x80\x9d and is represented in one or more old etchings about\r\n1790.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE R.--Madge Wildfire.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of the poor maniac, the Author may here observe that the\r\nfirst conception of the character, though afterwards greatly altered, was\r\ntaken from that of a person calling herself, and called by others,\r\nFeckless Fannie (weak or feeble Fannie), who always travelled with a\r\nsmall flock of sheep. The following account, furnished by the persevering\r\nkindness of Mr. Train, contains, probably, all that can now be known of\r\nher history, though many, among whom is the Author, may remember having\r\nheard of Feckless Fannie in the days of their youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy leisure hours,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Train, \xe2\x80\x9cfor some time past have been mostly\r\nspent in searching for particulars relating to the maniac called Feckless\r\nFannie, who travelled over all Scotland and England, between the years\r\n1767 and 1775, and whose history is altogether so like a romance, that I\r\nhave been at all possible pains to collect every particular that can be\r\nfound relative to her in Galloway, or in Ayrshire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Feckless Fannie appeared in Ayrshire, for the first time, in the\r\nsummer of 1769, she attracted much notice, from being attended by twelve\r\nor thirteen sheep, who seemed all endued with faculties so much superior\r\nto the ordinary race of animals of the same species, as to excite\r\nuniversal astonishment. She had for each a different name, to which it\r\nanswered when called by its mistress, and would likewise obey in the most\r\nsurprising manner any command she thought proper to give. When\r\ntravelling, she always walked in front of her flock, and they followed\r\nher closely behind. When she lay down at night in the fields, for she\r\nwould never enter into a house, they always disputed who should lie next\r\nto her, by which means she was kept warm, while she lay in the midst of\r\nthem; when she attempted to rise from the ground, an old ram, whose name\r\nwas Charlie, always claimed the sole right of assisting her; pushing any\r\nthat stood in his way aside, until he arrived right before his mistress;\r\nhe then bowed his head nearly to the ground that she might lay her hands\r\non his horns, which were very large; he then lifted her gently from the\r\nground by raising his head. If she chanced to leave her flock feeding, as\r\nsoon as they discovered she was gone, they all began to bleat most\r\npiteously, and would continue to do so till she returned; they would then\r\ntestify their joy by rubbing their sides against her petticoat and\r\nfrisking about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeckless Fannie was not, like most other demented creatures, fond of\r\nfine dress; on her head she wore an old slouched hat, over her shoulders\r\nan old plaid, and carried always in her hand a shepherd\xc3\xads crook; with any\r\nof these articles she invariably declared she would not part for any\r\nconsideration whatever. When she was interrogated why she set so much\r\nvalue on things seemingly so insignificant, she would sometimes relate\r\nthe history of her misfortune, which was briefly as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xabI am the only daughter of a wealthy squire in the north of England, but\r\nI loved my father\xc3\xads shepherd, and that has been my ruin; for my father,\r\nfearing his family would be disgraced by such an alliance, in a passion\r\nmortally wounded my lover with a shot from a pistol. I arrived just in\r\ntime to receive the last blessing of the dying man, and to close his eyes\r\nin death. He bequeathed me his little all, but I only accepted these\r\nsheep, to be my sole companions through life, and this hat, this plaid,\r\nand this crook, all of which I will carry until I descend into the\r\ngrave.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the substance of a ballad, eighty-four lines of which I copied\r\ndown lately from the recitation of an old woman in this place, who says\r\nshe has seen it in print, with a plate on the title-page, representing\r\nFannie with her sheep behind her. As this ballad is said to have been\r\nwritten by Lowe, the author of _Mary\xc3\xads Dream,_ I am surprised that it has\r\nnot been noticed by Cromek in his _Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway\r\nSong;_ but he perhaps thought it unworthy of a place in his collection,\r\nas there is very little merit in the composition; which want of room\r\nprevents me from transcribing at present. But if I thought you had never\r\nseen it, I would take an early opportunity of doing so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter having made the tour of Galloway in 1769, as Fannie was wandering\r\nin the neighbourhood of Moffat, on her way to Edinburgh, where, I am\r\ninformed, she was likewise well known, Old Charlie, her favourite ram,\r\nchanced to break into a kale-yard, which the proprietor observing, let\r\nloose a mastiff, that hunted the poor sheep to death. This was a sad\r\nmisfortune; it seemed to renew all the pangs which she formerly felt on\r\nthe death of her lover. She would not part from the side of her old\r\nfriend for several days, and it was with much difficulty she consented to\r\nallow him to be buried; but still wishing to pay a tribute to his memory,\r\nshe covered his grave with moss, and fenced it round with osiers, and\r\nannually returned to the same spot, and pulled the weeds from the grave\r\nand repaired the fence. This is altogether like a romance; but I believe\r\nit is really true that she did so. The grave of Charlie is still held\r\nsacred even by the school-boys of the present day in that quarter. It is\r\nnow, perhaps, the only instance of the law of Kenneth being attended to,\r\nwhich says, \xc3\xabThe grave where anie that is slaine lieth buried, leave\r\nuntilled for seven years. Repute every grave holie so as thou be well\r\nadvised, that in no wise with thy feet thou tread upon it.\xc3\xad\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the storms of winter, as well as in the milder seasons of the\r\nyear, she continued her wandering course, nor could she be prevented from\r\ndoing so, either by entreaty or promise of reward. The late Dr. Fullarton\r\nof Rosemount, in the neighbourhood of Ayr, being well acquainted with her\r\nfather when in England, endeavoured, in a severe season, by every means\r\nin his power, to detain her at Rosemount for a few days until the weather\r\nshould become more mild; but when she found herself rested a little, and\r\nsaw her sheep fed, she raised her crook, which was the signal she always\r\ngave for the sheep to follow her, and off they all marched together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the hour of poor Fannie\xc3\xads dissolution was now at hand, and she\r\nseemed anxious to arrive at the spot where she was to terminate her\r\nmortal career. She proceeded to Glasgow, and while passing through that\r\ncity a crowd of idle boys, attracted by her singular appearance, together\r\nwith the novelty of seeing so many sheep obeying her command, began to\r\nferment her with their pranks, till she became so irritated that she\r\npelted them with bricks and stones, which they returned in such a manner,\r\nthat she was actually stoned to death between Glasgow and Anderston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the real history of this singular individual credulity has attached\r\nseveral superstitious appendages. It is said that the farmer who was the\r\ncause of Charlie\xc3\xads death shortly afterwards drowned himself in a\r\npeat-hag; and that the hand with which a butcher in Kilinarnock struck\r\none of the other sheep became powerless, and withered to the very bone.\r\nIn the summer of 1769, when she was passing by New Cumnock, a young man,\r\nwhose name was William Forsyth, son of a farmer in the same parish,\r\nplagued her so much that she wished he might never see the morn; upon\r\nwhich he went home and hanged himself in his father\xc3\xads barn. And I doubt\r\nnot that many such stories may yet be remembered in other parts where she\r\nhad been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo far Mr. Train. The Author can only add to this narrative that Feckless\r\nFannie and her little flock were well known in the pastoral districts. In\r\nattempting to introduce such a character into fiction, the Author felt\r\nthe risk of encountering a comparison with the Maria of Sterne; and,\r\nbesides, the mechanism of the story would have been as much retarded by\r\nFeckless Fannie\xc3\xads flock as the night march of Don Quixote was delayed by\r\nSancho\xc3\xads tale of the sheep that were ferried over the river.\r\n\r\nThe Author has only to add, that notwithstanding the preciseness of his\r\nfriend Mr. Train\xc3\xads statement, there may be some hopes that the outrage on\r\nFeckless Fannie and her little flock was not carried to extremity. There\r\nis no mention of any trial on account of it, which, had it occurred in\r\nthe manner stated, would have certainly taken place; and the Author has\r\nunderstood that it was on the Border she was last seen, about the skirts\r\nof the Cheviot hills, but without her little flock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE S.--Death of Francis Gordon.\r\n\r\nThis exploit seems to have been one in which Patrick Walker prided\r\nhimself not a little; and there is reason to fear, that that excellent\r\nperson would have highly resented the attempt to associate another with\r\nhim in the slaughter of a King\xc3\xads Life-Guardsman. Indeed, he would have\r\nhad the more right to be offended at losing any share of the glory, since\r\nthe party against Gordon was already three to one, besides having the\r\nadvantage of firearms. The manner in which he vindicates his claim to the\r\nexploit, without committing himself by a direct statement of it, is not a\r\nlittle amusing. It is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall give a brief and true account of that man\xc3\xads death, which I did\r\nnot design to do while I was upon the stage; I resolve, indeed (if it be\r\nthe Lord\xc3\xads will), to leave a more full account of that and many other\r\nremarkable steps of the Lord\xc3\xads dispensations towards me through my life.\r\nIt was then commonly said, that Francis Gordon was a volunteer out of\r\nwickedness of principles, and could not stay with the troop, but was\r\nstill raging and ranging to catch hiding suffering people. Meldrum and\r\nAirly\xc3\xads troops, lying at Lanark upon the first day of March 1682, Mr.\r\nGordon and another wicked comrade, with their two servants and four\r\nhorses, came to Kilcaigow, two miles from Lanark, searching for William\r\nCaigow and others, under hiding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gordon, rambling throw the town, offered to abuse the women. At\r\nnight, they came a mile further to the Easter-Seat, to Robert Muir\xc3\xads, he\r\nbeing also under hiding. Gordon\xc3\xads comrade and the two servants went to\r\nbed, but he could sleep none, roaring all night for women. When day came,\r\nhe took only his sword in his hand, and came to Moss-platt, and some new\r\nmen (who had been in the fields all night) seeing him, they fled, and he\r\npursued. James Wilson, Thomas Young, and myself, having been in a meeting\r\nall night, were lying down in the morning. We were alarmed, thinking\r\nthere were many more than one; he pursued hard, and overtook us. Thomas\r\nYoung said, \xc3\xabSir, what do ye pursue us for?\xc3\xad He said, \xc3\xabhe was come to\r\nsend us to hell.\xc3\xad James Wilson said, \xc3\xabthat shall not be, for we will\r\ndefend ourselves.\xc3\xad He said, \xc3\xabthat either he or we should go to it now.\xc3\xad\r\nHe run his sword furiously throw James Wilson\xc3\xads coat. James fired upon\r\nhim, but missed him. All this time he cried, \xc3\xabDamn his soul!\xc3\xad He got a\r\nshot in his head out of a pocket-pistol, rather fit for diverting a boy\r\nthan killing such a furious, mad, brisk man, which, notwithstanding,\r\nkilled him dead. The foresaid William Caigow and Robert Muir came to us.\r\nWe searched him for papers, and found a long scroll of sufferers\xc3\xad names,\r\neither to kill or take. I tore it all in pieces. He had also some Popish\r\nbooks and bonds of money, with one dollar, which a poor man took off the\r\nground; all which we put in his pocket again. Thus, he was four miles\r\nfrom Lanark, and near a mile from his comrade, seeking his own death and\r\ngot it. And for as much as we have been condemned for this, I could never\r\nsee how any one could condemn us that allows of self-defence, which the\r\nlaws both of God and nature allow to every creature. For my own part, my\r\nheart never smote me for this. When I saw his blood run, I wished that\r\nall the blood of the Lord\xc3\xads stated and avowed enemies in Scotland had\r\nbeen in his veins. Having such a clear call and opportunity, I would have\r\nrejoiced to have seen it all gone out with a gush. I have many times\r\nwondered at the greater part of the indulged, lukewarm ministers and\r\nprofessors in that time, who made more noise of murder, when one of these\r\nenemies had been killed even in our own defence, than of twenty of us\r\nbeing murdered by them. None of these men present was challenged for this\r\nbut myself. Thomas Young thereafter suffered at Mauchline, but was not\r\nchallenged for this; Robert Muir was banished; James Wilson outlived the\r\npersecution; Williarn Caigow died in the Canongate Tolbooth, in the\r\nbeginning of 1685. Mr. Wodrow is misinformed, who says that he suffered\r\nunto death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE T.--Tolling to Service in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn the old days of Scotland, when persons of property (unless they\r\nhappened to be non-jurors) were as regular as their inferiors in\r\nattendance on parochial worship, there was a kind of etiquette, in\r\nwaiting till the patron or acknowledged great man of the parish should\r\nmake his appearance. This ceremonial was so sacred in the eyes of a\r\nparish beadle in the Isle of Bute, that the kirk bell being out of order,\r\nhe is said to have mounted the steeple every Sunday, to imitate with his\r\nvoice the successive summonses which its mouth of metal used to send\r\nforth. The first part of this imitative harmony was simply the repetition\r\nof the words _Bell bell, bell bell,_ two or three times in a manner as\r\nmuch resembling the sound as throat of flesh could imitate throat of\r\niron. _Bellu\xc3\xadm! bellu\xc3\xadm!_ was sounded forth in a more urgent manner; but\r\nhe never sent forth the third and conclusive peal, the varied tone of\r\nwhich is called in Scotland the ringing-in, until the two principal\r\nheritors of the parish approached, when the chime ran thus:--\r\n\r\n                          Bellu\xc3\xadm Belle\xc3\xadllum,\r\n                    Bernera and Knockdow\xc3\xads coming!\r\n                          Bellu\xc3\xadm Belle\xc3\xadllum,\r\n                    Bernera and Knockdow\xc3\xads coming!\r\n\r\nThereby intimating that service was instantly to proceed.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Mackinlay of Borrowstounness, a native of Bute, states that Sir\r\nWalter Scott had this story from Sir Adam Ferguson; but that the gallant\r\nknight had not given the lairds\xc3\xad titles correctly--the bellman\xc3\xads great\r\nmen being \xe2\x80\x9cCraich, Drumbuie, and Barnernie!\xe2\x80\x9d--1842.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Volume 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HEART OF MID-LOTHIAN ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
