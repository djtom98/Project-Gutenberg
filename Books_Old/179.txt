If, while the air is thickened\r\nby this frosty drizzle, the calendar should happen to indicate that the\r\nblessed vernal season is already six weeks old, it will be admitted\r\nthat no depressing influence is absent from the scene. This fact was\r\nkeenly felt on a certain 12th of May, upwards of thirty years since, by\r\na lady who stood looking out of one of the windows of the best hotel in\r\nthe ancient city of Boston. She had stood there for half an hour\xe2\x80\x94stood\r\nthere, that is, at intervals; for from time to time she turned back\r\ninto the room and measured its length with a restless step. In the\r\nchimney-place was a red-hot fire which emitted a small blue flame; and\r\nin front of the fire, at a table, sat a young man who was busily plying\r\na pencil. He had a number of sheets of paper cut into small equal\r\nsquares, and he was apparently covering them with pictorial\r\ndesigns\xe2\x80\x94strange-looking figures. He worked rapidly and attentively,\r\nsometimes threw back his head and held out his drawing at arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length,\r\nand kept up a soft, gay-sounding humming and whistling. The lady\r\nbrushed past him in her walk; her much-trimmed skirts were voluminous.\r\nShe never dropped her eyes upon his work; she only turned them,\r\noccasionally, as she passed, to a mirror suspended above the\r\ntoilet-table on the other side of the room. Here she paused a moment,\r\ngave a pinch to her waist with her two hands, or raised these\r\nmembers\xe2\x80\x94they were very plump and pretty\xe2\x80\x94to the multifold braids of her\r\nhair, with a movement half caressing, half corrective. An attentive\r\nobserver might have fancied that during these periods of desultory\r\nself-inspection her face forgot its melancholy; but as soon as she\r\nneared the window again it began to proclaim that she was a very\r\nill-pleased woman. And indeed, in what met her eyes there was little to\r\nbe pleased with. The window-panes were battered by the sleet; the\r\nhead-stones in the grave-yard beneath seemed to be holding themselves\r\naskance to keep it out of their faces. A tall iron railing protected\r\nthem from the street, and on the other side of the railing an\r\nassemblage of Bostonians were trampling about in the liquid snow. Many\r\nof them were looking up and down; they appeared to be waiting for\r\nsomething. From time to time a strange vehicle drew near to the place\r\nwhere they stood,\xe2\x80\x94such a vehicle as the lady at the window, in spite of\r\na considerable acquaintance with human inventions, had never seen\r\nbefore: a huge, low omnibus, painted in brilliant colors, and decorated\r\napparently with jangling bells, attached to a species of groove in the\r\npavement, through which it was dragged, with a great deal of rumbling,\r\nbouncing and scratching, by a couple of remarkably small horses. When\r\nit reached a certain point the people in front of the grave-yard, of\r\nwhom much the greater number were women, carrying satchels and parcels,\r\nprojected themselves upon it in a compact body\xe2\x80\x94a movement suggesting\r\nthe scramble for places in a life-boat at sea\xe2\x80\x94and were engulfed in its\r\nlarge interior. Then the life-boat\xe2\x80\x94or the life-car, as the lady at the\r\nwindow of the hotel vaguely designated it\xe2\x80\x94went bumping and jingling\r\naway upon its invisible wheels, with the helmsman (the man at the\r\nwheel) guiding its course incongruously from the prow. This phenomenon\r\nwas repeated every three minutes, and the supply of eagerly-moving\r\nwomen in cloaks, bearing reticules and bundles, renewed itself in the\r\nmost liberal manner. On the other side of the grave-yard was a row of\r\nsmall red brick houses, showing a series of homely, domestic-looking\r\nbacks; at the end opposite the hotel a tall wooden church-spire,\r\npainted white, rose high into the vagueness of the snow-flakes. The\r\nlady at the window looked at it for some time; for reasons of her own\r\nshe thought it the ugliest thing she had ever seen. She hated it, she\r\ndespised it; it threw her into a state of irritation that was quite out\r\nof proportion to any sensible motive. She had never known herself to\r\ncare so much about church-spires.\r\n\r\nShe was not pretty; but even when it expressed perplexed irritation her\r\nface was most interesting and agreeable. Neither was she in her first\r\nyouth; yet, though slender, with a great deal of extremely\r\nwell-fashioned roundness of contour\xe2\x80\x94a suggestion both of maturity and\r\nflexibility\xe2\x80\x94she carried her three and thirty years as a light-wristed\r\nHebe might have carried a brimming wine-cup. Her complexion was\r\nfatigued, as the French say; her mouth was large, her lips too full,\r\nher teeth uneven, her chin rather commonly modeled; she had a thick\r\nnose, and when she smiled\xe2\x80\x94she was constantly smiling\xe2\x80\x94the lines beside\r\nit rose too high, toward her eyes. But these eyes were charming: gray\r\nin color, brilliant, quickly glancing, gently resting, full of\r\nintelligence. Her forehead was very low\xe2\x80\x94it was her only handsome\r\nfeature; and she had a great abundance of crisp dark hair, finely\r\nfrizzled, which was always braided in a manner that suggested some\r\nSouthern or Eastern, some remotely foreign, woman. She had a large\r\ncollection of ear-rings, and wore them in alternation; and they seemed\r\nto give a point to her Oriental or exotic aspect. A compliment had once\r\nbeen paid her, which, being repeated to her, gave her greater pleasure\r\nthan anything she had ever heard. \xe2\x80\x9cA pretty woman?\xe2\x80\x9d someone had said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, her features are very bad.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about her features,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nvery discerning observer had answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she carries her head like a\r\npretty woman.\xe2\x80\x9d You may imagine whether, after this, she carried her\r\nhead less becomingly.\r\n\r\nShe turned away from the window at last, pressing her hands to her\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go back\xe2\x80\x94I shall go\r\nback!\xe2\x80\x9d And she flung herself into a chair before the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man softly, sketching away\r\nat his little scraps of paper.\r\n\r\nThe lady put out her foot; it was very small, and there was an immense\r\nrosette on her slipper. She fixed her eyes for a while on this\r\nornament, and then she looked at the glowing bed of anthracite coal in\r\nthe grate. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see anything so hideous as that fire?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndemanded. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see anything so\xe2\x80\x94so _affreux_ as\xe2\x80\x94as everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe spoke English with perfect purity; but she brought out this French\r\nepithet in a manner that indicated that she was accustomed to using\r\nFrench epithets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the fire is very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, glancing at it a\r\nmoment. \xe2\x80\x9cThose little blue tongues, dancing on top of the crimson\r\nembers, are extremely picturesque. They are like a fire in an\r\nalchemist\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too good-natured, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d his companion declared.\r\n\r\nThe young man held out one of his drawings, with his head on one side.\r\nHis tongue was gently moving along his under-lip. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-natured\xe2\x80\x94yes.\r\nToo good-natured\xe2\x80\x94no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are irritating,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, looking at her slipper.\r\n\r\nHe began to retouch his sketch. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you mean simply that you are\r\nirritated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, for that, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said his companion, with a little bitter laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the darkest day of my life\xe2\x80\x94and you know what that means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we have made a great mistake. If there is any doubt about it\r\ntoday, there certainly will be none tomorrow. _Ce sera clair, au\r\nmoins!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man was silent a few moments, driving his pencil. Then at\r\nlast, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no such things as mistakes,\xe2\x80\x9d he affirmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true\xe2\x80\x94for those who are not clever enough to perceive them. Not to\r\nrecognize one\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes\xe2\x80\x94that would be happiness in life,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady\r\nwent on, still looking at her pretty foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, always intent upon his\r\ndrawing, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the first time you have told me I am not clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, by your own theory I can\xe2\x80\x99t call it a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his\r\nsister, pertinently enough.\r\n\r\nThe young man gave a clear, fresh laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, at least, are clever\r\nenough, dearest sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not so when I proposed this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it you who proposed it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her brother.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head and gave him a little stare. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you desire the\r\ncredit of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like, I will take the blame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking up with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cyou make no difference in these\r\nthings. You have no sense of property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man gave his joyous laugh again. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that means I have no\r\nproperty, you are right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t joke about your poverty,\xe2\x80\x9d said his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is quite as\r\nvulgar as to boast about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poverty! I have just finished a drawing that will bring me fifty\r\nfrancs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cVoyons,\xe2\x80\x9d_ said the lady, putting out her hand.\r\n\r\nHe added a touch or two, and then gave her his sketch. She looked at\r\nit, but she went on with her idea of a moment before. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a woman were\r\nto ask you to marry her you would say, \xe2\x80\x98Certainly, my dear, with\r\npleasure!\xe2\x80\x99 And you would marry her and be ridiculously happy. Then at\r\nthe end of three months you would say to her, \xe2\x80\x98You know that blissful\r\nday when I begged you to be mine!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man had risen from the table, stretching his arms a little;\r\nhe walked to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a description of a charming nature,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, you have a charming nature; I regard that as our capital. If\r\nI had not been convinced of that I should never have taken the risk of\r\nbringing you to this dreadful country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis comical country, this delightful country!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young\r\nman, and he broke into the most animated laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it those women scrambling into the omnibus?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his companion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you suppose is the attraction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose there is a very good-looking man inside,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn each of them? They come along in hundreds, and the men in this\r\ncountry don\xe2\x80\x99t seem at all handsome. As for the women\xe2\x80\x94I have never seen\r\nso many at once since I left the convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe women are very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d her brother declared, \xe2\x80\x9cand the whole\r\naffair is very amusing. I must make a sketch of it.\xe2\x80\x9d And he came back\r\nto the table quickly, and picked up his utensils\xe2\x80\x94a small\r\nsketching-board, a sheet of paper, and three or four crayons. He took\r\nhis place at the window with these things, and stood there glancing\r\nout, plying his pencil with an air of easy skill. While he worked he\r\nwore a brilliant smile. Brilliant is indeed the word at this moment for\r\nhis strongly-lighted face. He was eight and twenty years old; he had a\r\nshort, slight, well-made figure. Though he bore a noticeable\r\nresemblance to his sister, he was a better favored person: fair-haired,\r\nclear-faced, witty-looking, with a delicate finish of feature and an\r\nexpression at once urbane and not at all serious, a warm blue eye, an\r\neyebrow finely drawn and excessively arched\xe2\x80\x94an eyebrow which, if ladies\r\nwrote sonnets to those of their lovers, might have been made the\r\nsubject of such a piece of verse\xe2\x80\x94and a light moustache that flourished\r\nupwards as if blown that way by the breath of a constant smile. There\r\nwas something in his physiognomy at once benevolent and picturesque.\r\nBut, as I have hinted, it was not at all serious. The young man\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nwas, in this respect, singular; it was not at all serious, and yet it\r\ninspired the liveliest confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe sure you put in plenty of snow,\xe2\x80\x9d said his sister. \xe2\x80\x9c_Bont\xc3\xa9 divine_,\r\nwhat a climate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall leave the sketch all white, and I shall put in the little\r\nfigures in black,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man answered, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall call\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94what is that line in Keats?\xe2\x80\x94Mid-May\xe2\x80\x99s Eldest Child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cthat mamma ever told me it was like\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma never told you anything disagreeable. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not like\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94every day. You will see that tomorrow we shall have a splendid\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Qu\xe2\x80\x99en savez-vous?_ Tomorrow I shall go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere away from here. Back to Silberstadt. I shall write to the\r\nReigning Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man turned a little and looked at her, with his crayon\r\npoised. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Eugenia,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cwere you so happy at sea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia got up; she still held in her hand the drawing her brother had\r\ngiven her. It was a bold, expressive sketch of a group of miserable\r\npeople on the deck of a steamer, clinging together and clutching at\r\neach other, while the vessel lurched downward, at a terrific angle,\r\ninto the hollow of a wave. It was extremely clever, and full of a sort\r\nof tragi-comical power. Eugenia dropped her eyes upon it and made a sad\r\ngrimace. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you draw such odious scenes?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nlike to throw it into the fire!\xe2\x80\x9d And she tossed the paper away. Her\r\nbrother watched, quietly, to see where it went. It fluttered down to\r\nthe floor, where he let it lie. She came toward the window, pinching in\r\nher waist. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you reproach me\xe2\x80\x94abuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\r\nshould feel better then. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that you hate me for\r\nbringing you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you would not believe it. I adore you, dear sister! I am\r\ndelighted to be here, and I am charmed with the prospect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what had taken possession of me. I had lost my head,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEugenia went on.\r\n\r\nThe young man, on his side, went on plying his pencil. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is evidently\r\na most curious and interesting country. Here we are, and I mean to\r\nenjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion turned away with an impatient step, but presently came\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cHigh spirits are doubtless an excellent thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nyou give one too much of them, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t see that they have done you\r\nany good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man stared, with lifted eyebrows, smiling; he tapped his\r\nhandsome nose with his pencil. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have made me happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the least they could do; they have made you nothing else. You\r\nhave gone through life thanking fortune for such very small favors that\r\nshe has never put herself to any trouble for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must have put herself to a little, I think, to present me with so\r\nadmirable a sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe serious, Felix. You forget that I am your elder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a sister, then, so elderly!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Felix, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI hoped\r\nwe had left seriousness in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy you will find it here. Remember that you are nearly thirty\r\nyears old, and that you are nothing but an obscure Bohemian\xe2\x80\x94a penniless\r\ncorrespondent of an illustrated newspaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObscure as much as you please, but not so much of a Bohemian as you\r\nthink. And not at all penniless! I have a hundred pounds in my pocket.\r\nI have an engagement to make fifty sketches, and I mean to paint the\r\nportraits of all our cousins, and of all _their_ cousins, at a hundred\r\ndollars a head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not ambitious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are, dear Baroness,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man replied.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness was silent a moment, looking out at the sleet-darkened\r\ngrave-yard and the bumping horse-cars. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am ambitious,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nat last. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my ambition has brought me to this dreadful place!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nglanced about her\xe2\x80\x94the room had a certain vulgar nudity; the bed and the\r\nwindow were curtainless\xe2\x80\x94and she gave a little passionate sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nold ambition!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. Then she flung herself down upon a sofa\r\nwhich stood near against the wall, and covered her face with her hands.\r\n\r\nHer brother went on with his drawing, rapidly and skillfully; after\r\nsome moments he sat down beside her and showed her his sketch. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you think that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good for an obscure Bohemian?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have knocked off another fifty francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia glanced at the little picture as he laid it on her lap. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nit is very clever,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. And in a moment she added, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nsuppose our cousins do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet into those things, and look like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix meditated awhile. \xe2\x80\x9cI really can\xe2\x80\x99t say. It will be interesting to\r\ndiscover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the rich people can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very sure they are rich?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felix, lightly.\r\n\r\nHis sister slowly turned in her place, looking at him. \xe2\x80\x9cHeavenly\r\npowers!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a way of bringing out things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will certainly be much pleasanter if they are rich,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose if I had not known they were rich I would ever have\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man met his sister\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat peremptory eye with his bright,\r\ncontented glance. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it certainly will be pleasanter,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all I expect of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t count upon\r\ntheir being clever or friendly\xe2\x80\x94at first\xe2\x80\x94or elegant or interesting. But\r\nI assure you I insist upon their being rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix leaned his head upon the back of the sofa and looked awhile at\r\nthe oblong patch of sky to which the window served as frame. The snow\r\nwas ceasing; it seemed to him that the sky had begun to brighten. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncount upon their being rich,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cand powerful, and\r\nclever, and friendly, and elegant, and interesting, and generally\r\ndelightful! _Tu vas voir_.\xe2\x80\x9d And he bent forward and kissed his sister.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook there!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a portent, even while I speak, the sky is\r\nturning the color of gold; the day is going to be splendid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, within five minutes the weather had changed. The sun broke\r\nout through the snow-clouds and jumped into the Baroness\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Bont\xc3\xa9 divine_,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed this lady, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a climate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go out and see the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\nAnd after a while they went out. The air had grown warm as well as\r\nbrilliant; the sunshine had dried the pavements. They walked about the\r\nstreets at hazard, looking at the people and the houses, the shops and\r\nthe vehicles, the blazing blue sky and the muddy crossings, the\r\nhurrying men and the slow-strolling maidens, the fresh red bricks and\r\nthe bright green trees, the extraordinary mixture of smartness and\r\nshabbiness. From one hour to another the day had grown vernal; even in\r\nthe bustling streets there was an odor of earth and blossom. Felix was\r\nimmensely entertained. He had called it a comical country, and he went\r\nabout laughing at everything he saw. You would have said that American\r\ncivilization expressed itself to his sense in a tissue of capital\r\njokes. The jokes were certainly excellent, and the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmerriment was joyous and genial. He possessed what is called the\r\npictorial sense; and this first glimpse of democratic manners stirred\r\nthe same sort of attention that he would have given to the movements of\r\na lively young person with a bright complexion. Such attention would\r\nhave been demonstrative and complimentary; and in the present case\r\nFelix might have passed for an undispirited young exile revisiting the\r\nhaunts of his childhood. He kept looking at the violent blue of the\r\nsky, at the scintillating air, at the scattered and multiplied patches\r\nof color.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Comme c\xe2\x80\x99est bariol\xc3\xa9_, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his sister in that foreign\r\ntongue which they both appeared to feel a mysterious prompting\r\noccasionally to use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is _bariol\xc3\xa9_ indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the\r\ncoloring; it hurts my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shows how extremes meet,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of\r\ncoming to the West we seem to have gone to the East. The way the sky\r\ntouches the house-tops is just like Cairo; and the red and blue\r\nsign-boards patched over the face of everything remind one of Mahometan\r\ndecorations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young women are not Mahometan,\xe2\x80\x9d said his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nsaid to hide their faces. I never saw anything so bold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank Heaven they don\xe2\x80\x99t hide their faces!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir faces\r\nare uncommonly pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, their faces are often very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, who was a\r\nvery clever woman. She was too clever a woman not to be capable of a\r\ngreat deal of just and fine observation. She clung more closely than\r\nusual to her brother\xe2\x80\x99s arm; she was not exhilarated, as he was; she\r\nsaid very little, but she noted a great many things and made her\r\nreflections. She was a little excited; she felt that she had indeed\r\ncome to a strange country, to make her fortune. Superficially, she was\r\nconscious of a good deal of irritation and displeasure; the Baroness\r\nwas a very delicate and fastidious person. Of old, more than once, she\r\nhad gone, for entertainment\xe2\x80\x99s sake and in brilliant company, to a fair\r\nin a provincial town. It seemed to her now that she was at an enormous\r\nfair\xe2\x80\x94that the entertainment and the _d\xc3\xa9sagr\xc3\xa9ments_ were very much the\r\nsame. She found herself alternately smiling and shrinking; the show was\r\nvery curious, but it was probable, from moment to moment, that one\r\nwould be jostled. The Baroness had never seen so many people walking\r\nabout before; she had never been so mixed up with people she did not\r\nknow. But little by little she felt that this fair was a more serious\r\nundertaking. She went with her brother into a large public garden,\r\nwhich seemed very pretty, but where she was surprised at seeing no\r\ncarriages. The afternoon was drawing to a close; the coarse, vivid\r\ngrass and the slender tree-boles were gilded by the level\r\nsunbeams\xe2\x80\x94gilded as with gold that was fresh from the mine. It was the\r\nhour at which ladies should come out for an airing and roll past a\r\nhedge of pedestrians, holding their parasols askance. Here, however,\r\nEugenia observed no indications of this custom, the absence of which\r\nwas more anomalous as there was a charming avenue of remarkably\r\ngraceful, arching elms in the most convenient contiguity to a large,\r\ncheerful street, in which, evidently, among the more prosperous members\r\nof the _bourgeoisie_, a great deal of pedestrianism went forward. Our\r\nfriends passed out into this well lighted promenade, and Felix noticed\r\na great many more pretty girls and called his sister\xe2\x80\x99s attention to\r\nthem. This latter measure, however, was superfluous; for the Baroness\r\nhad inspected, narrowly, these charming young ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel an intimate conviction that our cousins are like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFelix.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness hoped so, but this is not what she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are very\r\npretty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they are mere little girls. Where are the\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94the women of thirty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf thirty-three, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d her brother was going to ask; for he\r\nunderstood often both what she said and what she did not say. But he\r\nonly exclaimed upon the beauty of the sunset, while the Baroness, who\r\nhad come to seek her fortune, reflected that it would certainly be well\r\nfor her if the persons against whom she might need to measure herself\r\nshould all be mere little girls. The sunset was superb; they stopped to\r\nlook at it; Felix declared that he had never seen such a gorgeous\r\nmixture of colors. The Baroness also thought it splendid; and she was\r\nperhaps the more easily pleased from the fact that while she stood\r\nthere she was conscious of much admiring observation on the part of\r\nvarious nice-looking people who passed that way, and to whom a\r\ndistinguished, strikingly-dressed woman with a foreign air, exclaiming\r\nupon the beauties of nature on a Boston street corner in the French\r\ntongue, could not be an object of indifference. Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s spirits rose.\r\nShe surrendered herself to a certain tranquil gaiety. If she had come\r\nto seek her fortune, it seemed to her that her fortune would be easy to\r\nfind. There was a promise of it in the gorgeous purity of the western\r\nsky; there was an intimation in the mild, unimpertinent gaze of the\r\npassers of a certain natural facility in things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not go back to Silberstadt, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor write to the Reigning Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall write to him that they evidently know nothing about him over\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cI advise you to let him\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix himself continued to be in high good humor. Brought up among\r\nancient customs and in picturesque cities, he yet found plenty of local\r\ncolor in the little Puritan metropolis. That evening, after dinner, he\r\ntold his sister that he should go forth early on the morrow to look up\r\ntheir cousins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very impatient,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be more natural,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cafter seeing all those pretty\r\ngirls today? If one\xe2\x80\x99s cousins are of that pattern, the sooner one knows\r\nthem the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they are not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to have brought some\r\nletters\xe2\x80\x94to some other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other people would not be our kinsfolk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly they would be none the worse for that,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness replied.\r\n\r\nHer brother looked at her with his eyebrows lifted. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was not what\r\nyou said when you first proposed to me that we should come out here and\r\nfraternize with our relatives. You said that it was the prompting of\r\nnatural affection; and when I suggested some reasons against it you\r\ndeclared that the _voix du sang_ should go before everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember all that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVividly! I was greatly moved by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was walking up and down the room, as she had done in the morning;\r\nshe stopped in her walk and looked at her brother. She apparently was\r\ngoing to say something, but she checked herself and resumed her walk.\r\nThen, in a few moments, she said something different, which had the\r\neffect of an explanation of the suppression of her earlier thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never be anything but a child, dear brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would suppose that you, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Felix, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cwere a\r\nthousand years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am\xe2\x80\x94sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go, then, and announce to our cousins the arrival of a\r\npersonage so extraordinary. They will immediately come and pay you\r\ntheir respects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia paced the length of the room again, and then she stopped before\r\nher brother, laying her hand upon his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are not to come and\r\nsee me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not to allow that. That is not the way I\r\nshall meet them first.\xe2\x80\x9d And in answer to his interrogative glance she\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will go and examine, and report. You will come back and\r\ntell me who they are and what they are; their number, gender, their\r\nrespective ages\xe2\x80\x94all about them. Be sure you observe everything; be\r\nready to describe to me the locality, the accessories\xe2\x80\x94how shall I say\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94the _mise en sc\xc3\xa8ne_. Then, at my own time, at my own hour, under\r\ncircumstances of my own choosing, I will go to them. I will present\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94I will appear before them!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, this time\r\nphrasing her idea with a certain frankness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what message am I to take to them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felix, who had a lively\r\nfaith in the justness of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a moment\xe2\x80\x94at his expression of agreeable veracity;\r\nand, with that justness that he admired, she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSay what you\r\nplease. Tell my story in the way that seems to you most\xe2\x80\x94natural.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nshe bent her forehead for him to kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was splendid, as Felix had prophesied; if the winter had\r\nsuddenly leaped into spring, the spring had for the moment as quickly\r\nleaped into summer. This was an observation made by a young girl who\r\ncame out of a large square house in the country, and strolled about in\r\nthe spacious garden which separated it from a muddy road. The flowering\r\nshrubs and the neatly-disposed plants were basking in the abundant\r\nlight and warmth; the transparent shade of the great elms\xe2\x80\x94they were\r\nmagnificent trees\xe2\x80\x94seemed to thicken by the hour; and the intensely\r\nhabitual stillness offered a submissive medium to the sound of a\r\ndistant church-bell. The young girl listened to the church-bell; but\r\nshe was not dressed for church. She was bare-headed; she wore a white\r\nmuslin waist, with an embroidered border, and the skirt of her dress\r\nwas of colored muslin. She was a young lady of some two or three and\r\ntwenty years of age, and though a young person of her sex walking\r\nbare-headed in a garden, of a Sunday morning in spring-time, can, in\r\nthe nature of things, never be a displeasing object, you would not have\r\npronounced this innocent Sabbath-breaker especially pretty. She was\r\ntall and pale, thin and a little awkward; her hair was fair and\r\nperfectly straight; her eyes were dark, and they had the singularity of\r\nseeming at once dull and restless\xe2\x80\x94differing herein, as you see, fatally\r\nfrom the ideal \xe2\x80\x9cfine eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d which we always imagine to be both\r\nbrilliant and tranquil. The doors and windows of the large square house\r\nwere all wide open, to admit the purifying sunshine, which lay in\r\ngenerous patches upon the floor of a wide, high, covered piazza\r\nadjusted to two sides of the mansion\xe2\x80\x94a piazza on which several\r\nstraw-bottomed rocking-chairs and half a dozen of those small\r\ncylindrical stools in green and blue porcelain, which suggest an\r\naffiliation between the residents and the Eastern trade, were\r\nsymmetrically disposed. It was an ancient house\xe2\x80\x94ancient in the sense of\r\nbeing eighty years old; it was built of wood, painted a clean, clear,\r\nfaded gray, and adorned along the front, at intervals, with flat wooden\r\npilasters, painted white. These pilasters appeared to support a kind of\r\nclassic pediment, which was decorated in the middle by a large triple\r\nwindow in a boldly carved frame, and in each of its smaller angles by a\r\nglazed circular aperture. A large white door, furnished with a\r\nhighly-polished brass knocker, presented itself to the rural-looking\r\nroad, with which it was connected by a spacious pathway, paved with\r\nworn and cracked, but very clean, bricks. Behind it there were meadows\r\nand orchards, a barn and a pond; and facing it, a short distance along\r\nthe road, on the opposite side, stood a smaller house, painted white,\r\nwith external shutters painted green, a little garden on one hand and\r\nan orchard on the other. All this was shining in the morning air,\r\nthrough which the simple details of the picture addressed themselves to\r\nthe eye as distinctly as the items of a \xe2\x80\x9csum\xe2\x80\x9d in addition.\r\n\r\nA second young lady presently came out of the house, across the piazza,\r\ndescended into the garden and approached the young girl of whom I have\r\nspoken. This second young lady was also thin and pale; but she was\r\nolder than the other; she was shorter; she had dark, smooth hair. Her\r\neyes, unlike the other\xe2\x80\x99s, were quick and bright; but they were not at\r\nall restless. She wore a straw bonnet with white ribbons, and a long,\r\nred, India scarf, which, on the front of her dress, reached to her\r\nfeet. In her hand she carried a little key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9care you very sure you had better not go to\r\nchurch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at her a moment, plucked a small sprig from a\r\nlilac-bush, smelled it and threw it away. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not very sure of\r\nanything!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nThe other young lady looked straight past her, at the distant pond,\r\nwhich lay shining between the long banks of fir trees. Then she said in\r\na very soft voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the key of the dining-room closet. I think\r\nyou had better have it, if anyone should want anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is there to want anything?\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be all\r\nalone in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone may come,\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Mr. Brand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Gertrude. He may like a piece of cake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like men that are always eating cake!\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude declared,\r\ngiving a pull at the lilac-bush.\r\n\r\nHer companion glanced at her, and then looked down on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink father expected you would come to church,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall\r\nI say to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay I have a bad headache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould that be true?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the elder lady, looking straight at the\r\npond again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger one simply.\r\n\r\nCharlotte transferred her quiet eyes to her companion\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nafraid you are feeling restless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am feeling as I always feel,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude replied, in the same tone.\r\n\r\nCharlotte turned away; but she stood there a moment. Presently she\r\nlooked down at the front of her dress. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem to you,\r\nsomehow, as if my scarf were too long?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nGertrude walked half round her, looking at the scarf. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nyou wear it right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I wear it, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; differently from that. You should draw it differently\r\nover your shoulders, round your elbows; you should look differently\r\nbehind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I look?\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, plucking out the scarf a\r\nlittle behind. \xe2\x80\x9cI could do it myself, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can explain\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte, by a movement of her elbows, corrected the laxity that had\r\ncome from her companion\xe2\x80\x99s touch. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, some day you must do it for me.\r\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter now. Indeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it matters,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow one looks behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say it mattered more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwho may be observing you. You are not on your guard. You can\xe2\x80\x99t try to\r\nlook pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte received this declaration with extreme gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink one should ever try to look pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, earnestly.\r\n\r\nHer companion was silent. Then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not of\r\nmuch use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte looked at her a little, and then kissed her. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will\r\nbe better when we come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sister, I am very well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\nCharlotte went down the large brick walk to the garden gate; her\r\ncompanion strolled slowly toward the house. At the gate Charlotte met a\r\nyoung man, who was coming in\xe2\x80\x94a tall, fair young man, wearing a high hat\r\nand a pair of thread gloves. He was handsome, but rather too stout. He\r\nhad a pleasant smile. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Brand!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to see whether your sister was not going to church,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says she is not going; but I am very glad you have come. I think\r\nif you were to talk to her a little\xe2\x80\x9d.... And Charlotte lowered her\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems as if she were restless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand smiled down on the young lady from his great height. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nbe very glad to talk to her. For that I should be willing to absent\r\nmyself from almost any occasion of worship, however attractive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, softly, as if positive\r\nacceptance of this proposition might be dangerous. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am afraid I\r\nshall be late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will have a pleasant sermon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Gilman is always pleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte answered. And she went\r\non her way.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand went into the garden, where Gertrude, hearing the gate close\r\nbehind him, turned and looked at him. For a moment she watched him\r\ncoming; then she turned away. But almost immediately she corrected this\r\nmovement, and stood still, facing him. He took off his hat and wiped\r\nhis forehead as he approached. Then he put on his hat again and held\r\nout his hand. His hat being removed, you would have perceived that his\r\nforehead was very large and smooth, and his hair abundant but rather\r\ncolorless. His nose was too large, and his mouth and eyes were too\r\nsmall; but for all this he was, as I have said, a young man of striking\r\nappearance. The expression of his little clean-colored blue eyes was\r\nirresistibly gentle and serious; he looked, as the phrase is, as good\r\nas gold. The young girl, standing in the garden path, glanced, as he\r\ncame up, at his thread gloves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hoped you were going to church,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to walk with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to\r\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had shaken hands with him; he held her hand a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any\r\nspecial reason for not going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Brand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask what it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him smiling; and in her smile, as I have intimated, there\r\nwas a certain dullness. But mingled with this dullness was something\r\nsweet and suggestive. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause the sky is so blue!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the sky, which was magnificent, and then said, smiling\r\ntoo, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of young ladies staying at home for bad weather, but\r\nnever for good. Your sister, whom I met at the gate, tells me you are\r\ndepressed,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepressed? I am never depressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, surely, sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brand, as if he thought this a\r\nregrettable account of one\xe2\x80\x99s self.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am never depressed,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am sometimes wicked.\r\nWhen I am wicked I am in high spirits. I was wicked just now to my\r\nsister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said things that puzzled her\xe2\x80\x94on purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you do that, Miss Gertrude?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man.\r\n\r\nShe began to smile again. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause the sky is so blue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say things that puzzle _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always know when I do it,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cBut people puzzle me\r\nmore, I think. And they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand observed, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me to tell you about my\xe2\x80\x94my struggles,\xe2\x80\x9d the young girl went\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us talk about them. I have so many things to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude turned away a moment; and then, turning back, \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better\r\ngo to church,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man urged, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have always one thing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at him a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t say it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, taking off his hat; \xe2\x80\x9call alone in\r\nthis beautiful Sunday stillness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked around her, at the breaking buds, the shining distance,\r\nthe blue sky to which she had referred as a pretext for her\r\nirregularities. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the reason,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to\r\nspeak. Do me a favor; go to church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I speak when I come back?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Brand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are still disposed,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you are wicked,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are certainly\r\npuzzling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had turned away; she raised her hands to her ears. He looked at her\r\na moment, and then he slowly walked to church.\r\n\r\nShe wandered for a while about the garden, vaguely and without purpose.\r\nThe church-bell had stopped ringing; the stillness was complete. This\r\nyoung lady relished highly, on occasions, the sense of being alone\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nabsence of the whole family and the emptiness of the house. Today,\r\napparently, the servants had also gone to church; there was never a\r\nfigure at the open windows; behind the house there was no stout negress\r\nin a red turban, lowering the bucket into the great shingle-hooded\r\nwell. And the front door of the big, unguarded home stood open, with\r\nthe trustfulness of the golden age; or what is more to the purpose,\r\nwith that of New England\xe2\x80\x99s silvery prime. Gertrude slowly passed\r\nthrough it, and went from one of the empty rooms to the other\xe2\x80\x94large,\r\nclear-colored rooms, with white wainscots, ornamented with thin-legged\r\nmahogany furniture, and, on the walls, with old-fashioned engravings,\r\nchiefly of scriptural subjects, hung very high. This agreeable sense of\r\nsolitude, of having the house to herself, of which I have spoken,\r\nalways excited Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s imagination; she could not have told you why,\r\nand neither can her humble historian. It always seemed to her that she\r\nmust do something particular\xe2\x80\x94that she must honor the occasion; and\r\nwhile she roamed about, wondering what she could do, the occasion\r\nusually came to an end. Today she wondered more than ever. At last she\r\ntook down a book; there was no library in the house, but there were\r\nbooks in all the rooms. None of them were forbidden books, and Gertrude\r\nhad not stopped at home for the sake of a chance to climb to the\r\ninaccessible shelves. She possessed herself of a very obvious\r\nvolume\xe2\x80\x94one of the series of the _Arabian Nights_\xe2\x80\x94and she brought it out\r\ninto the portico and sat down with it in her lap. There, for a quarter\r\nof an hour, she read the history of the loves of the Prince\r\nCamaralzaman and the Princess Badoura. At last, looking up, she beheld,\r\nas it seemed to her, the Prince Camaralzaman standing before her. A\r\nbeautiful young man was making her a very low bow\xe2\x80\x94a magnificent bow,\r\nsuch as she had never seen before. He appeared to have dropped from the\r\nclouds; he was wonderfully handsome; he smiled\xe2\x80\x94smiled as if he were\r\nsmiling on purpose. Extreme surprise, for a moment, kept Gertrude\r\nsitting still; then she rose, without even keeping her finger in her\r\nbook. The young man, with his hat in his hand, still looked at her,\r\nsmiling and smiling. It was very strange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you kindly tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mysterious visitor, at last,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhether I have the honor of speaking to Miss Wentworth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Gertrude Wentworth,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen\xe2\x80\x94then\xe2\x80\x94I have the honor\xe2\x80\x94the pleasure\xe2\x80\x94of being your cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man had so much the character of an apparition that this\r\nannouncement seemed to complete his unreality. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat cousin? Who are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\nHe stepped back a few paces and looked up at the house; then glanced\r\nround him at the garden and the distant view. After this he burst out\r\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI see it must seem to you very strange,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. There was,\r\nafter all, something substantial in his laughter. Gertrude looked at\r\nhim from head to foot. Yes, he was remarkably handsome; but his smile\r\nwas almost a grimace. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very still,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, coming nearer\r\nagain. And as she only looked at him, for reply, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you all\r\nalone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone has gone to church,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid of that!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope you are\r\nnot afraid of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to tell me who you are,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid of you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a different plan. I\r\nexpected the servant would take in my card, and that you would put your\r\nheads together, before admitting me, and make out my identity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude had been wondering with a quick intensity which brought its\r\nresult; and the result seemed an answer\xe2\x80\x94a wondrous, delightful\r\nanswer\xe2\x80\x94to her vague wish that something would befall her. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou come from Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe came two days ago. You have heard of us, then\xe2\x80\x94you believe in us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have known, vaguely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we had relations in\r\nFrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you ever wanted to see us?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man.\r\n\r\nGertrude was silent a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI have wanted to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad, then, it is you I have found. We wanted to see you, so we\r\ncame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gertrude.\r\n\r\nThe young man looked round him, smiling still. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes; on purpose.\r\nDoes that sound as if we should bore you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\r\nshall\xe2\x80\x94I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think we shall. We are rather fond of wandering,\r\ntoo; and we were glad of a pretext.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have just arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Boston, two days ago. At the inn I asked for Mr. Wentworth. He must\r\nbe your father. They found out for me where he lived; they seemed often\r\nto have heard of him. I determined to come, without ceremony. So, this\r\nlovely morning, they set my face in the right direction, and told me to\r\nwalk straight before me, out of town. I came on foot because I wanted\r\nto see the country. I walked and walked, and here I am! It\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nmany miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is seven miles and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, softly. Now that this\r\nhandsome young man was proving himself a reality she found herself\r\nvaguely trembling; she was deeply excited. She had never in her life\r\nspoken to a foreigner, and she had often thought it would be delightful\r\nto do so. Here was one who had suddenly been engendered by the Sabbath\r\nstillness for her private use; and such a brilliant, polite, smiling\r\none! She found time and means to compose herself, however: to remind\r\nherself that she must exercise a sort of official hospitality. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\nvery\xe2\x80\x94very glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come into the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd she moved toward the open door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not afraid of me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man again, with his\r\nlight laugh.\r\n\r\nShe wondered a moment, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not afraid\xe2\x80\x94here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cAh, comme vous devez avoir raison!\xe2\x80\x9d_ cried the young man, looking all\r\nround him, appreciatively. It was the first time that Gertrude had\r\nheard so many words of French spoken. They gave her something of a\r\nsensation. Her companion followed her, watching, with a certain\r\nexcitement of his own, this tall, interesting-looking girl, dressed in\r\nher clear, crisp muslin. He paused in the hall, where there was a broad\r\nwhite staircase with a white balustrade. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pleasant house!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lighter inside than it is out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pleasanter here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, and she led the way into the\r\nparlor,\xe2\x80\x94a high, clean, rather empty-looking room. Here they stood\r\nlooking at each other,\xe2\x80\x94the young man smiling more than ever; Gertrude,\r\nvery serious, trying to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you know my name,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am called Felix Young.\r\nYour father is my uncle. My mother was his half sister, and older than\r\nhe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, \xe2\x80\x9cand she turned Roman Catholic and married in\r\nEurope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cShe married and she died. Your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s family didn\xe2\x80\x99t like her husband. They called him a foreigner;\r\nbut he was not. My poor father was born in Sicily, but his parents were\r\nAmerican.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Sicily?\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix Young, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they had spent their lives in\r\nEurope. But they were very patriotic. And so are we.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are Sicilian,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSicilian, no! Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. I was born at a little place\xe2\x80\x94a dear little\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94in France. My sister was born at Vienna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are French,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man. Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed upon\r\nhim almost insistently. He began to laugh again. \xe2\x80\x9cI can easily be\r\nFrench, if that will please you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a foreigner of some sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf some sort\xe2\x80\x94yes; I suppose so. But who can say of what sort? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink we have ever had occasion to settle the question. You know there\r\nare people like that. About their country, their religion, their\r\nprofession, they can\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude stood there gazing; she had not asked him to sit down. She had\r\nnever heard of people like that; she wanted to hear. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you\r\nlive?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t tell that, either!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you will think\r\nthey are little better than vagabonds. I have lived\r\nanywhere\xe2\x80\x94everywhere. I really think I have lived in every city in\r\nEurope.\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude gave a little long soft exhalation. It made the young\r\nman smile at her again; and his smile made her blush a little. To take\r\nrefuge from blushing she asked him if, after his long walk, he was not\r\nhungry or thirsty. Her hand was in her pocket; she was fumbling with\r\nthe little key that her sister had given her. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, clasping his hands a little, \xe2\x80\x9cif you could give me, in\r\ncharity, a glass of wine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude gave a smile and a little nod, and went quickly out of the\r\nroom. Presently she came back with a very large decanter in one hand\r\nand a plate in the other, on which was placed a big, round cake with a\r\nfrosted top. Gertrude, in taking the cake from the closet, had had a\r\nmoment of acute consciousness that it composed the refection of which\r\nher sister had thought that Mr. Brand would like to partake. Her\r\nkinsman from across the seas was looking at the pale, high-hung\r\nengravings. When she came in he turned and smiled at her, as if they\r\nhad been old friends meeting after a separation. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wait upon me\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI am served like the gods!\xe2\x80\x9d She had waited upon a\r\ngreat many people, but none of them had ever told her that. The\r\nobservation added a certain lightness to the step with which she went\r\nto a little table where there were some curious red glasses\xe2\x80\x94glasses\r\ncovered with little gold sprigs, which Charlotte used to dust every\r\nmorning with her own hands. Gertrude thought the glasses very handsome,\r\nand it was a pleasure to her to know that the wine was good; it was her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s famous madeira. Felix Young thought it excellent; he wondered\r\nwhy he had been told that there was no wine in America. She cut him an\r\nimmense triangle out of the cake, and again she thought of Mr. Brand.\r\nFelix sat there, with his glass in one hand and his huge morsel of cake\r\nin the other\xe2\x80\x94eating, drinking, smiling, talking. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all tired; I am never tired. But I am very hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must stay to dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. They will\r\nall have come back from church; you will see the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are the others?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cDescribe them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see for yourself. It is you that must tell me; now, about\r\nyour sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister is the Baroness M\xc3\xbcnster,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\nOn hearing that his sister was a Baroness, Gertrude got up and walked\r\nabout slowly, in front of him. She was silent a moment. She was\r\nthinking of it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t she come, too?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did come; she is in Boston, at the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go and see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe begs you will not!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man replied. \xe2\x80\x9cShe sends you her\r\nlove; she sent me to announce her. She will come and pay her respects\r\nto your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude felt herself trembling again. A Baroness M\xc3\xbcnster, who sent a\r\nbrilliant young man to \xe2\x80\x9cannounce\xe2\x80\x9d her; who was coming, as the Queen of\r\nSheba came to Solomon, to pay her \xe2\x80\x9crespects\xe2\x80\x9d to quiet Mr.\r\nWentworth\xe2\x80\x94such a personage presented herself to Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s vision with\r\na most effective unexpectedness. For a moment she hardly knew what to\r\nsay. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen will she come?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as you will allow her\xe2\x80\x94tomorrow. She is very impatient,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Felix, who wished to be agreeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. She wished to ask more about her; but\r\nshe hardly knew what could be predicated of a Baroness M\xc3\xbcnster. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x94is she\xe2\x80\x94married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix had finished his cake and wine; he got up, fixing upon the young\r\ngirl his bright, expressive eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is married to a German\r\nprince\xe2\x80\x94Prince Adolf, of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. He is not the\r\nreigning prince; he is a younger brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude gazed at her informant; her lips were slightly parted. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she\r\na\xe2\x80\x94a _Princess_?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cher position is rather a singular one.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a morganatic marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorganatic?\xe2\x80\x9d These were new names and new words to poor Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what they call a marriage, you know, contracted between a scion\r\nof a ruling house and\xe2\x80\x94and a common mortal. They made Eugenia a\r\nBaroness, poor woman; but that was all they could do. Now they want to\r\ndissolve the marriage. Prince Adolf, between ourselves, is a ninny; but\r\nhis brother, who is a clever man, has plans for him. Eugenia, naturally\r\nenough, makes difficulties; not, however, that I think she cares\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s a very clever woman; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll like her\xe2\x80\x94but she wants\r\nto bother them. Just now everything is _en l\xe2\x80\x99air_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cheerful, off-hand tone in which her visitor related this darkly\r\nromantic tale seemed to Gertrude very strange; but it seemed also to\r\nconvey a certain flattery to herself, a recognition of her wisdom and\r\ndignity. She felt a dozen impressions stirring within her, and\r\npresently the one that was uppermost found words. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to\r\ndissolve her marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it appears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd against her will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgainst her right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must be very unhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\nHer visitor looked at her, smiling; he raised his hand to the back of\r\nhis head and held it there a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cSo she says,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s her story. She told me to tell it you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will leave that to her; she does it better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude gave her little excited sigh again. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if she is unhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad she has come to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had been so interested that she failed to notice the sound of a\r\nfootstep in the portico; and yet it was a footstep that she always\r\nrecognized. She heard it in the hall, and then she looked out of the\r\nwindow. They were all coming back from church\xe2\x80\x94her father, her sister\r\nand brother, and their cousins, who always came to dinner on Sunday.\r\nMr. Brand had come in first; he was in advance of the others, because,\r\napparently, he was still disposed to say what she had not wished him to\r\nsay an hour before. He came into the parlor, looking for Gertrude. He\r\nhad two little books in his hand. On seeing Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s companion he\r\nslowly stopped, looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this a cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felix.\r\n\r\nThen Gertrude saw that she must introduce him; but her ears, and, by\r\nsympathy, her lips, were full of all that he had been telling her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Prince of\r\nSilberstadt-Schreckenstein!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix burst out laughing, and Mr. Brand stood staring, while the\r\nothers, who had passed into the house, appeared behind him in the open\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening at dinner Felix Young gave his sister, the Baroness\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster, an account of his impressions. She saw that he had come back\r\nin the highest possible spirits; but this fact, to her own mind, was\r\nnot a reason for rejoicing. She had but a limited confidence in her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s judgment; his capacity for taking rose-colored views was such\r\nas to vulgarize one of the prettiest of tints. Still, she supposed he\r\ncould be trusted to give her the mere facts; and she invited him with\r\nsome eagerness to communicate them. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, at least, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nturn you out from the door;\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been away some ten\r\nhours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn me from the door!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey took me to their\r\nhearts; they killed the fatted calf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you want to say: they are a collection of angels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are a collection of angels\xe2\x80\x94simply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_C\xe2\x80\x99est bien vague_,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike nothing you ever saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I am much obliged; but that is hardly more definite.\r\nSeriously, they were glad to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnchanted. It has been the proudest day of my life. Never, never have\r\nI been so lionized! I assure you, I was cock of the walk. My dear\r\nsister,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, \xe2\x80\x9c_nous n\xe2\x80\x99avons qu\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa0 nous tenir_; we shall\r\nbe great swells!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster looked at him, and her eye exhibited a slight responsive\r\nspark. She touched her lips to a glass of wine, and then she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDescribe them. Give me a picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix drained his own glass. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the country, among the\r\nmeadows and woods; a wild sort of place, and yet not far from here.\r\nOnly, such a road, my dear! Imagine one of the Alpine glaciers\r\nreproduced in mud. But you will not spend much time on it, for they\r\nwant you to come and stay, once for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, \xe2\x80\x9cthey want me to come and stay, once for all?\r\n_Bon_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s intensely rural, tremendously natural; and all overhung with this\r\nstrange white light, this far-away blue sky. There\xe2\x80\x99s a big wooden\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94a kind of three-story bungalow; it looks like a magnified\r\nNuremberg toy. There was a gentleman there that made a speech to me\r\nabout it and called it a \xe2\x80\x98venerable mansion;\xe2\x80\x99 but it looks as if it had\r\nbeen built last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it handsome\xe2\x80\x94is it elegant?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Baroness.\r\n\r\nFelix looked at her a moment, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very clean! No splendors,\r\nno gilding, no troops of servants; rather straight-backed chairs. But\r\nyou might eat off the floors, and you can sit down on the stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be a privilege. And the inhabitants are straight-backed too,\r\nof course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cthe inhabitants are charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what style?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a style of their own. How shall I describe it? It\xe2\x80\x99s primitive; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npatriarchal; it\xe2\x80\x99s the _ton_ of the golden age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have they nothing golden but their _ton_? Are there no symptoms of\r\nwealth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say there was wealth without symptoms. A plain, homely way of\r\nlife: nothing for show, and very little for\xe2\x80\x94what shall I call it?\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthe senses; but a great _aisance_, and a lot of money, out of sight,\r\nthat comes forward very quietly for subscriptions to institutions, for\r\nrepairing tenements, for paying doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bills; perhaps even for\r\nportioning daughters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the daughters?\xe2\x80\x9d Madame M\xc3\xbcnster demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many are there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two, Charlotte and Gertrude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man was silent, looking at his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cCharlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in return. \xe2\x80\x9cI see. You are in love with Gertrude.\r\nThey must be Puritans to their finger-tips; anything but gay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they are not gay,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are sober; they are even\r\nsevere. They are of a pensive cast; they take things hard. I think\r\nthere is something the matter with them; they have some melancholy\r\nmemory or some depressing expectation. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the epicurean\r\ntemperament. My uncle, Mr. Wentworth, is a tremendously high-toned old\r\nfellow; he looks as if he were undergoing martyrdom, not by fire, but\r\nby freezing. But we shall cheer them up; we shall do them good. They\r\nwill take a good deal of stirring up; but they are wonderfully kind and\r\ngentle. And they are appreciative. They think one clever; they think\r\none remarkable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very fine, so far as it goes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut are we\r\nto be shut up to these three people, Mr. Wentworth and the two young\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94what did you say their names were\xe2\x80\x94Deborah and Hephzibah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; there is another little girl, a cousin of theirs, a very\r\npretty creature; a thorough little American. And then there is the son\r\nof the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are coming to the gentlemen. What of the\r\nson of the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid he gets tipsy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, then, has the epicurean temperament! How old is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a boy of twenty; a pretty young fellow, but I am afraid he has\r\nvulgar tastes. And then there is Mr. Brand\xe2\x80\x94a very tall young man, a\r\nsort of lay-priest. They seem to think a good deal of him, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexactly make him out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is there nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Baroness, \xe2\x80\x9cbetween these\r\nextremes\xe2\x80\x94this mysterious ecclesiastic and that intemperate youth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, there is Mr. Acton. I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, with a nod\r\nat his sister, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will like Mr. Acton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember that I am very fastidious,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he very\r\ngood manners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will have them with you. He is a man of the world; he has been to\r\nChina.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster gave a little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cA man of the Chinese world! He\r\nmust be very interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an idea that he brought home a fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is always interesting. Is he young, good-looking, clever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is less than forty; he has a baldish head; he says witty things. I\r\nrather think,\xe2\x80\x9d added the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he will admire the Baroness\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said this lady. Her brother never knew how she\r\nwould take things; but shortly afterwards she declared that he had made\r\na very pretty description and that on the morrow she would go and see\r\nfor herself.\r\n\r\nThey mounted, accordingly, into a great barouche\xe2\x80\x94a vehicle as to which\r\nthe Baroness found nothing to criticise but the price that was asked\r\nfor it and the fact that the coachman wore a straw hat. (At Silberstadt\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster had had liveries of yellow and crimson.) They drove into\r\nthe country, and the Baroness, leaning far back and swaying her\r\nlace-fringed parasol, looked to right and to left and surveyed the\r\nway-side objects. After a while she pronounced them _affreux_. Her\r\nbrother remarked that it was apparently a country in which the\r\nforeground was inferior to the _plans recul\xc3\xa9s_; and the Baroness\r\nrejoined that the landscape seemed to be all foreground. Felix had\r\nfixed with his new friends the hour at which he should bring his\r\nsister; it was four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon. The large, clean-faced\r\nhouse wore, to his eyes, as the barouche drove up to it, a very\r\nfriendly aspect; the high, slender elms made lengthening shadows in\r\nfront of it. The Baroness descended; her American kinsfolk were\r\nstationed in the portico. Felix waved his hat to them, and a tall, lean\r\ngentleman, with a high forehead and a clean shaven face, came forward\r\ntoward the garden gate. Charlotte Wentworth walked at his side.\r\nGertrude came behind, more slowly. Both of these young ladies wore\r\nrustling silk dresses. Felix ushered his sister into the gate. \xe2\x80\x9cBe very\r\ngracious,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her. But he saw the admonition was superfluous.\r\nEugenia was prepared to be gracious as only Eugenia could be. Felix\r\nknew no keener pleasure than to be able to admire his sister\r\nunrestrictedly; for if the opportunity was frequent, it was not\r\ninveterate. When she desired to please she was to him, as to everyone\r\nelse, the most charming woman in the world. Then he forgot that she was\r\never anything else; that she was sometimes hard and perverse; that he\r\nwas occasionally afraid of her. Now, as she took his arm to pass into\r\nthe garden, he felt that she desired, that she proposed, to please, and\r\nthis situation made him very happy. Eugenia would please.\r\n\r\nThe tall gentleman came to meet her, looking very rigid and grave. But\r\nit was a rigidity that had no illiberal meaning. Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s manner\r\nwas pregnant, on the contrary, with a sense of grand responsibility, of\r\nthe solemnity of the occasion, of its being difficult to show\r\nsufficient deference to a lady at once so distinguished and so unhappy.\r\nFelix had observed on the day before his characteristic pallor; and now\r\nhe perceived that there was something almost cadaverous in his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh-featured white face. But so clever were this young man\xe2\x80\x99s quick\r\nsympathies and perceptions that he already learned that in these\r\nsemi-mortuary manifestations there was no cause for alarm. His light\r\nimagination had gained a glimpse of Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual\r\nmechanism, and taught him that, the old man being infinitely\r\nconscientious, the special operation of conscience within him announced\r\nitself by several of the indications of physical faintness.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness took her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and stood looking at him with her\r\nugly face and her beautiful smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I done right to come?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery right, very right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, solemnly. He had arranged\r\nin his mind a little speech; but now it quite faded away. He felt\r\nalmost frightened. He had never been looked at in just that way\xe2\x80\x94with\r\njust that fixed, intense smile\xe2\x80\x94by any woman; and it perplexed and\r\nweighed upon him, now, that the woman who was smiling so and who had\r\ninstantly given him a vivid sense of her possessing other unprecedented\r\nattributes, was his own niece, the child of his own father\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\nThe idea that his niece should be a German Baroness, married\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmorganatically\xe2\x80\x9d to a Prince, had already given him much to think\r\nabout. Was it right, was it just, was it acceptable? He always slept\r\nbadly, and the night before he had lain awake much more even than\r\nusual, asking himself these questions. The strange word \xe2\x80\x9cmorganatic\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas constantly in his ears; it reminded him of a certain Mrs. Morgan\r\nwhom he had once known and who had been a bold, unpleasant woman. He\r\nhad a feeling that it was his duty, so long as the Baroness looked at\r\nhim, smiling in that way, to meet her glance with his own scrupulously\r\nadjusted, consciously frigid organs of vision; but on this occasion he\r\nfailed to perform his duty to the last. He looked away toward his\r\ndaughters. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are very glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to\r\nintroduce my daughters\xe2\x80\x94Miss Charlotte Wentworth, Miss Gertrude\r\nWentworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness thought she had never seen people less demonstrative. But\r\nCharlotte kissed her and took her hand, looking at her sweetly and\r\nsolemnly. Gertrude seemed to her almost funereal, though Gertrude might\r\nhave found a source of gaiety in the fact that Felix, with his\r\nmagnificent smile, had been talking to her; he had greeted her as a\r\nvery old friend. When she kissed the Baroness she had tears in her\r\neyes. Madame M\xc3\xbcnster took each of these young women by the hand, and\r\nlooked at them all over. Charlotte thought her very strange-looking and\r\nsingularly dressed; she could not have said whether it was well or ill.\r\nShe was glad, at any rate, that they had put on their silk\r\ngowns\xe2\x80\x94especially Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cMy cousins are very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nBaroness, turning her eyes from one to the other. \xe2\x80\x9cYour daughters are\r\nvery handsome, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte blushed quickly; she had never yet heard her personal\r\nappearance alluded to in a loud, expressive voice. Gertrude looked\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94not at Felix; she was extremely pleased. It was not the compliment\r\nthat pleased her; she did not believe it; she thought herself very\r\nplain. She could hardly have told you the source of her satisfaction;\r\nit came from something in the way the Baroness spoke, and it was not\r\ndiminished\xe2\x80\x94it was rather deepened, oddly enough\xe2\x80\x94by the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisbelief. Mr. Wentworth was silent; and then he asked, formally,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come into the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are not all; you have some other children,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a son,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he come to meet me?\xe2\x80\x9d Eugenia cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid he is\r\nnot so charming as his sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I will see about it,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is rather afraid of ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte said, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very handsome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, as loud as she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go in and find him. We will draw him out of his _cachette_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd the Baroness took Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s arm, who was not aware that he\r\nhad offered it to her, and who, as they walked toward the house,\r\nwondered whether he ought to have offered it and whether it was proper\r\nfor her to take it if it had not been offered. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know you\r\nwell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, interrupting these meditations, \xe2\x80\x9cand I want\r\nyou to know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems natural that we should know each other,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth\r\nrejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are near relatives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there comes a moment in life when one reverts, irresistibly, to\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s natural ties\xe2\x80\x94to one\xe2\x80\x99s natural affections. You must have found\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia.\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth had been told the day before by Felix that Eugenia was\r\nvery clever, very brilliant, and the information had held him in some\r\nsuspense. This was the cleverness, he supposed; the brilliancy was\r\nbeginning. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the natural affections are very strong,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn some people,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness declared. \xe2\x80\x9cNot in all.\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte was\r\nwalking beside her; she took hold of her hand again, smiling always.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, _cousine_, where did you get that enchanting complexion?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on; \xe2\x80\x9csuch lilies and roses?\xe2\x80\x9d The roses in poor Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance began speedily to predominate over the lilies, and she\r\nquickened her step and reached the portico. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the country of\r\ncomplexions,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness continued, addressing herself to Mr.\r\nWentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced they are more delicate. There are very good\r\nones in England\xe2\x80\x94in Holland; but they are very apt to be coarse. There\r\nis too much red.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you will find,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this country is\r\nsuperior in many respects to those you mention. I have been to England\r\nand Holland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have been to Europe?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come\r\nand see me? But it\xe2\x80\x99s better, after all, this way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. They were\r\nentering the house; she paused and looked round her. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you have\r\narranged your house\xe2\x80\x94your beautiful house\xe2\x80\x94in the\xe2\x80\x94in the Dutch taste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house is very old,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mr. Wentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Washington\r\nonce spent a week here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have heard of Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father used\r\nto tell me of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth was silent a moment, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cI found he was very well\r\nknown in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nFelix had lingered in the garden with Gertrude; he was standing before\r\nher and smiling, as he had done the day before. What had happened the\r\nday before seemed to her a kind of dream. He had been there and he had\r\nchanged everything; the others had seen him, they had talked with him;\r\nbut that he should come again, that he should be part of the future,\r\npart of her small, familiar, much-meditating life\xe2\x80\x94this needed, afresh,\r\nthe evidence of her senses. The evidence had come to her senses now;\r\nand her senses seemed to rejoice in it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of Eugenia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFelix asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she charming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very brilliant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell yet. She\r\nseems to me like a singer singing an air. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell till the song\r\nis done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the song will never be done!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young man, laughing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think her handsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude had been disappointed in the beauty of the Baroness M\xc3\xbcnster;\r\nshe had expected her, for mysterious reasons, to resemble a very pretty\r\nportrait of the Empress Josephine, of which there hung an engraving in\r\none of the parlors, and which the younger Miss Wentworth had always\r\ngreatly admired. But the Baroness was not at all like that\xe2\x80\x94not at all.\r\nThough different, however, she was very wonderful, and Gertrude felt\r\nherself most suggestively corrected. It was strange, nevertheless, that\r\nFelix should speak in that positive way about his sister\xe2\x80\x99s beauty. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink I _shall_ think her handsome,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be very\r\ninteresting to know her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if I ever could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you will know her well; you will become great friends,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix\r\ndeclared, as if this were the easiest thing in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very graceful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, looking after the Baroness,\r\nsuspended to her father\xe2\x80\x99s arm. It was a pleasure to her to say that\r\nanyone was graceful.\r\n\r\nFelix had been looking about him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd your little cousin, of\r\nyesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho was so wonderfully pretty\xe2\x80\x94what has become of\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is in the parlor,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is very pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe felt as if it were her duty to take him straight into the house, to\r\nwhere he might be near her cousin. But after hesitating a moment she\r\nlingered still. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe you would come back,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot come back!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, then, the\r\nimpression made upon this susceptible heart of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wondered whether he meant the impression her cousin Lizzie had\r\nmade. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we should ever see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray what did you think would become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I thought you would melt away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a compliment to my solidity! I melt very often,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut there is always something left of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came and waited for you by the door, because the others did,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGertrude went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you had never appeared I should not have been\r\nsurprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Felix, looking at her, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would have been\r\ndisappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a little, and shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cAh, par exemple!\xe2\x80\x9d_ cried the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cYou deserve that I should\r\nnever leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoing into the parlor they found Mr. Wentworth performing\r\nintroductions. A young man was standing before the Baroness, blushing a\r\ngood deal, laughing a little, and shifting his weight from one foot to\r\nthe other\xe2\x80\x94a slim, mild-faced young man, with neatly-arranged features,\r\nlike those of Mr. Wentworth. Two other gentlemen, behind him, had risen\r\nfrom their seats, and a little apart, near one of the windows, stood a\r\nremarkably pretty young girl. The young girl was knitting a stocking;\r\nbut, while her fingers quickly moved, she looked with wide, brilliant\r\neyes at the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is your son\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia, smiling at the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Clifford Wentworth, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come out to meet me, Mr. Clifford Wentworth?\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nBaroness demanded, with her beautiful smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you would want me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, slowly sidling\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne always wants a _beau cousin_,\xe2\x80\x94if one has one! But if you are very\r\nnice to me in future I won\xe2\x80\x99t remember it against you.\xe2\x80\x9d And Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster transferred her smile to the other persons present. It rested\r\nfirst upon the candid countenance and long-skirted figure of Mr. Brand,\r\nwhose eyes were intently fixed upon Mr. Wentworth, as if to beg him not\r\nto prolong an anomalous situation. Mr. Wentworth pronounced his name.\r\nEugenia gave him a very charming glance, and then looked at the other\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nThis latter personage was a man of rather less than the usual stature\r\nand the usual weight, with a quick, observant, agreeable dark eye, a\r\nsmall quantity of thin dark hair, and a small moustache. He had been\r\nstanding with his hands in his pockets; and when Eugenia looked at him\r\nhe took them out. But he did not, like Mr. Brand, look evasively and\r\nurgently at their host. He met Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; he appeared to\r\nappreciate the privilege of meeting them. Madame M\xc3\xbcnster instantly felt\r\nthat he was, intrinsically, the most important person present. She was\r\nnot unconscious that this impression was in some degree manifested in\r\nthe little sympathetic nod with which she acknowledged Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nannouncement, \xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin, Mr. Acton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cousin\xe2\x80\x94not mine?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt only depends upon you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Acton declared, laughing.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness looked at him a moment, and noticed that he had very white\r\nteeth. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it depend upon your behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I had\r\nbetter wait. I have cousins enough. Unless I can also claim\r\nrelationship,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cwith that charming young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\npointed to the young girl at the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Acton. And Gertrude Wentworth put her arm\r\nround the young girl and led her forward. It was not, apparently, that\r\nshe needed much leading. She came toward the Baroness with a light,\r\nquick step, and with perfect self-possession, rolling her stocking\r\nround its needles. She had dark blue eyes and dark brown hair; she was\r\nwonderfully pretty.\r\n\r\nEugenia kissed her, as she had kissed the other young women, and then\r\nheld her off a little, looking at her. \xe2\x80\x9cNow this is quite another\r\n_type_,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; she pronounced the word in the French manner. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nis a different outline, my uncle, a different character, from that of\r\nyour own daughters. This, Felix,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis very much more what\r\nwe have always thought of as the American type.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl, during this exposition, was smiling askance at everyone\r\nin turn, and at Felix out of turn. \xe2\x80\x9cI find only one type here!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nFelix, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe type adorable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sally was received in perfect silence, but Felix, who learned all\r\nthings quickly, had already learned that the silences frequently\r\nobserved among his new acquaintances were not necessarily restrictive\r\nor resentful. It was, as one might say, the silence of expectation, of\r\nmodesty. They were all standing round his sister, as if they were\r\nexpecting her to acquit herself of the exhibition of some peculiar\r\nfaculty, some brilliant talent. Their attitude seemed to imply that she\r\nwas a kind of conversational mountebank, attired, intellectually, in\r\ngauze and spangles. This attitude gave a certain ironical force to\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s next words. \xe2\x80\x9cNow this is your circle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her\r\nuncle. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is your _salon_. These are your regular _habitu\xc3\xa9s_, eh? I\r\nam so glad to see you all together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are always dropping in and out. You\r\nmust do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Charlotte Wentworth, \xe2\x80\x9cthey must do something\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d And she turned her sweet, serious face, that seemed at once\r\ntimid and placid, upon their interesting visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEugenia-Camilla-Dolores,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say Eugenia, if you will let me. You must come and stay with\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness laid her hand upon Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s arm very tenderly; but she\r\nreserved herself. She was wondering whether it would be possible to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstay\xe2\x80\x9d with these people. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be very charming\xe2\x80\x94very charming,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said; and her eyes wandered over the company, over the room. She\r\nwished to gain time before committing herself. Her glance fell upon\r\nyoung Mr. Brand, who stood there, with his arms folded and his hand on\r\nhis chin, looking at her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman, I suppose, is a sort of\r\necclesiastic,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Mr. Wentworth, lowering her voice a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a minister,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Protestant?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Eugenia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a Unitarian, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Brand, impressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething new.\xe2\x80\x9d She had never heard of this\r\nform of worship.\r\n\r\nMr. Acton began to laugh, and Gertrude looked anxiously at Mr. Brand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have come very far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery far\xe2\x80\x94very far,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness replied, with a graceful shake of her\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94a shake that might have meant many different things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why you ought to settle down with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nWentworth, with that dryness of utterance which, as Eugenia was too\r\nintelligent not to feel, took nothing from the delicacy of his meaning.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, and for an instant, in his cold, still face, she\r\nseemed to see a far-away likeness to the vaguely remembered image of\r\nher mother. Eugenia was a woman of sudden emotions, and now,\r\nunexpectedly, she felt one rising in her heart. She kept looking round\r\nthe circle; she knew that there was admiration in all the eyes that\r\nwere fixed upon her. She smiled at them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to look\xe2\x80\x94to try\xe2\x80\x94to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me I have done\r\nwell. I am very tired; I want to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d There were tears in her eyes.\r\nThe luminous interior, the gentle, tranquil people, the simple, serious\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94the sense of these things pressed upon her with an overmastering\r\nforce, and she felt herself yielding to one of the most genuine\r\nemotions she had ever known. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray take me in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough she was smiling, there were tears in her voice as well as in her\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear niece,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, softly. And Charlotte put\r\nout her arms and drew the Baroness toward her; while Robert Acton\r\nturned away, with his hands stealing into his pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after the Baroness M\xc3\xbcnster had presented herself to her\r\nAmerican kinsfolk she came, with her brother, and took up her abode in\r\nthat small white house adjacent to Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s own dwelling of\r\nwhich mention has already been made. It was on going with his daughters\r\nto return her visit that Mr. Wentworth placed this comfortable cottage\r\nat her service; the offer being the result of a domestic colloquy,\r\ndiffused through the ensuing twenty-four hours, in the course of which\r\nthe two foreign visitors were discussed and analyzed with a great deal\r\nof earnestness and subtlety. The discussion went forward, as I say, in\r\nthe family circle; but that circle on the evening following Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s return to town, as on many other occasions, included Robert\r\nActon and his pretty sister. If you had been present, it would probably\r\nnot have seemed to you that the advent of these brilliant strangers was\r\ntreated as an exhilarating occurrence, a pleasure the more in this\r\ntranquil household, a prospective source of entertainment. This was not\r\nMr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s way of treating any human occurrence. The sudden\r\nirruption into the well-ordered consciousness of the Wentworths of an\r\nelement not allowed for in its scheme of usual obligations required a\r\nreadjustment of that sense of responsibility which constituted its\r\nprincipal furniture. To consider an event, crudely and baldly, in the\r\nlight of the pleasure it might bring them was an intellectual exercise\r\nwith which Felix Young\xe2\x80\x99s American cousins were almost wholly\r\nunacquainted, and which they scarcely supposed to be largely pursued in\r\nany section of human society. The arrival of Felix and his sister was a\r\nsatisfaction, but it was a singularly joyless and inelastic\r\nsatisfaction. It was an extension of duty, of the exercise of the more\r\nrecondite virtues; but neither Mr. Wentworth, nor Charlotte, nor Mr.\r\nBrand, who, among these excellent people, was a great promoter of\r\nreflection and aspiration, frankly adverted to it as an extension of\r\nenjoyment. This function was ultimately assumed by Gertrude Wentworth,\r\nwho was a peculiar girl, but the full compass of whose peculiarities\r\nhad not been exhibited before they very ingeniously found their pretext\r\nin the presence of these possibly too agreeable foreigners. Gertrude,\r\nhowever, had to struggle with a great accumulation of obstructions,\r\nboth of the subjective, as the metaphysicians say, and of the\r\nobjective, order; and indeed it is no small part of the purpose of this\r\nlittle history to set forth her struggle. What seemed paramount in this\r\nabrupt enlargement of Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies and those of his\r\ndaughters was an extension of the field of possible mistakes; and the\r\ndoctrine, as it may almost be called, of the oppressive gravity of\r\nmistakes was one of the most cherished traditions of the Wentworth\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she wants to come and stay in this house,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGertrude; Madame M\xc3\xbcnster, from this time forward, receiving no other\r\ndesignation than the personal pronoun. Charlotte and Gertrude acquired\r\nconsiderable facility in addressing her, directly, as \xe2\x80\x9cEugenia;\xe2\x80\x9d but in\r\nspeaking of her to each other they rarely called her anything but\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t she think it good enough for her?\xe2\x80\x9d cried little Lizzie Acton,\r\nwho was always asking unpractical questions that required, in\r\nstrictness, no answer, and to which indeed she expected no other answer\r\nthan such as she herself invariably furnished in a small,\r\ninnocently-satirical laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe certainly expressed a willingness to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was only politeness,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude rejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is very polite\xe2\x80\x94very polite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is too polite,\xe2\x80\x9d his son declared, in a softly growling tone which\r\nwas habitual to him, but which was an indication of nothing worse than\r\na vaguely humorous intention. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very embarrassing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is more than can be said of you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lizzie Acton, with\r\nher little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to encourage her,\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lizzie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will not think of you, Clifford,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not!\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will think of Robert,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude continued, in the same tone.\r\n\r\nRobert Acton began to blush; but there was no occasion for it, for\r\neveryone was looking at Gertrude\xe2\x80\x94everyone, at least, save Lizzie, who,\r\nwith her pretty head on one side, contemplated her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you attribute motives, Gertrude?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t attribute motives, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cI only say she\r\nwill think of Robert; and she will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGertrude judges by herself!\xe2\x80\x9d Acton exclaimed, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\nGertrude? Of course the Baroness will think of me. She will think of me\r\nfrom morning till night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will be very comfortable here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, with something of\r\na housewife\xe2\x80\x99s pride. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can have the large northeast room. And the\r\nFrench bedstead,\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte added, with a constant sense of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforeignness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will not like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude; \xe2\x80\x9cnot even if you pin little\r\ntidies all over the chairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Charlotte, perceiving a touch of irony here, but\r\nnot resenting it.\r\n\r\nGertrude had left her chair; she was walking about the room; her stiff\r\nsilk dress, which she had put on in honor of the Baroness, made a sound\r\nupon the carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will want something\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94more private.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she wants to be private she can stay in her room,\xe2\x80\x9d Lizzie Acton\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\nGertrude paused in her walk, looking at her. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would not be\r\npleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wants privacy and pleasure together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobert Acton began to laugh again. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear cousin, what a picture!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte had fixed her serious eyes upon her sister; she wondered\r\nwhence she had suddenly derived these strange notions. Mr. Wentworth\r\nalso observed his younger daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what her manner of life may have been,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she\r\ncertainly never can have enjoyed a more refined and salubrious home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude stood there looking at them all. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is the wife of a\r\nPrince,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all princes here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth; \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any\r\npalace in this neighborhood that is to let.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin William,\xe2\x80\x9d Robert Acton interposed, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you want to do something\r\nhandsome? Make them a present, for three months, of the little house\r\nover the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very generous with other people\xe2\x80\x99s things!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobert is very generous with his own things,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth observed\r\ndispassionately, and looking, in cold meditation, at his kinsman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d Lizzie went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI had an idea you were so fond of your new\r\ncousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich new cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the Baroness!\xe2\x80\x9d the young girl rejoined, with her laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you expected to see so much of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Felix? I hope to see a great deal of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you want to keep him out of the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at Lizzie Acton, and then looked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you want me to live in the house with you, Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nClifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you never will. I hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d Such was this young lady\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, stopping before Mr. Wentworth and smiling,\r\nwith a smile the sweeter, as her smile always was, for its rarity; \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nlet them live in the little house over the way. It will be lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobert Acton had been watching her. \xe2\x80\x9cGertrude is right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGertrude is the cleverest girl in the world. If I might take the\r\nliberty, I should strongly recommend their living there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing there so pretty as the northeast room,\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte\r\nurged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will make it pretty. Leave her alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Acton exclaimed.\r\n\r\nGertrude, at his compliment, had blushed and looked at him: it was as\r\nif someone less familiar had complimented her. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure she will make\r\nit pretty. It will be very interesting. It will be a place to go to. It\r\nwill be a foreign house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we very sure that we need a foreign house?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth\r\ninquired. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it desirable to establish a foreign house\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthis quiet place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cas if it were a question of the\r\npoor Baroness opening a wine-shop or a gaming-table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be too lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude declared again, laying her hand on\r\nthe back of her father\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she should open a gaming-table?\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte asked, with great\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at her a moment, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGertrude is growing pert,\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford Wentworth observed, with his\r\nhumorous young growl. \xe2\x80\x9cThat comes of associating with foreigners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth looked up at his daughter, who was standing beside him;\r\nhe drew her gently forward. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be careful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nkeep watch. Indeed, we must all be careful. This is a great change; we\r\nare to be exposed to peculiar influences. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say they are bad. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t judge them in advance. But they may perhaps make it necessary\r\nthat we should exercise a great deal of wisdom and self-control. It\r\nwill be a different tone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude was silent a moment, in deference to her father\xe2\x80\x99s speech; then\r\nshe spoke in a manner that was not in the least an answer to it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant to see how they will live. I am sure they will have different\r\nhours. She will do all kinds of little things differently. When we go\r\nover there it will be like going to Europe. She will have a boudoir.\r\nShe will invite us to dinner\xe2\x80\x94very late. She will breakfast in her\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte gazed at her sister again. Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s imagination seemed to\r\nher to be fairly running riot. She had always known that Gertrude had a\r\ngreat deal of imagination\xe2\x80\x94she had been very proud of it. But at the\r\nsame time she had always felt that it was a dangerous and irresponsible\r\nfaculty; and now, to her sense, for the moment, it seemed to threaten\r\nto make her sister a strange person who should come in suddenly, as\r\nfrom a journey, talking of the peculiar and possibly unpleasant things\r\nshe had observed. Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s imagination took no journeys whatever;\r\nshe kept it, as it were, in her pocket, with the other furniture of\r\nthis receptacle\xe2\x80\x94a thimble, a little box of peppermint, and a morsel of\r\ncourt-plaster. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she would have any dinner\xe2\x80\x94or any\r\nbreakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Wentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she knows how to do\r\nanything herself. I should have to get her ever so many servants, and\r\nshe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has a maid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude; \xe2\x80\x9ca French maid. She mentioned her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if the maid has a little fluted cap and red slippers,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLizzie Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a French maid in that play that Robert took me\r\nto see. She had pink stockings; she was very wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a _soubrette_,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude announced, who had never seen a play\r\nin her life. \xe2\x80\x9cThey call that a soubrette. It will be a great chance to\r\nlearn French.\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte gave a little soft, helpless groan. She had a\r\nvision of a wicked, theatrical person, clad in pink stockings and red\r\nshoes, and speaking, with confounding volubility, an incomprehensible\r\ntongue, flitting through the sacred penetralia of that large, clean\r\nhouse. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is one reason in favor of their coming here,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we can make Eugenia speak French to us, and Felix. I mean\r\nto begin\xe2\x80\x94the next time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth had kept her standing near him, and he gave her his\r\nearnest, thin, unresponsive glance again. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to make me a\r\npromise, Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to get excited. Not to allow these\xe2\x80\x94these occurrences to be an\r\noccasion for excitement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked down at him a moment, and then she shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I can promise that, father. I am excited already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth was silent a while; they all were silent, as if in\r\nrecognition of something audacious and portentous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think they had better go to the other house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall keep them in the other house,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth subjoined, more\r\npregnantly.\r\n\r\nGertrude turned away; then she looked across at Robert Acton. Her\r\ncousin Robert was a great friend of hers; she often looked at him this\r\nway instead of saying things. Her glance on this occasion, however,\r\nstruck him as a substitute for a larger volume of diffident utterance\r\nthan usual, inviting him to observe, among other things, the\r\ninefficiency of her father\xe2\x80\x99s design\xe2\x80\x94if design it was\xe2\x80\x94for diminishing,\r\nin the interest of quiet nerves, their occasions of contact with their\r\nforeign relatives. But Acton immediately complimented Mr. Wentworth\r\nupon his liberality. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cgiving\r\nthem the little house. You will have treated them handsomely, and,\r\nwhatever happens, you will be glad of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth was liberal,\r\nand he knew he was liberal. It gave him pleasure to know it, to feel\r\nit, to see it recorded; and this pleasure is the only palpable form of\r\nself-indulgence with which the narrator of these incidents will be able\r\nto charge him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA three days\xe2\x80\x99 visit at most, over there, is all I should have found\r\npossible,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame M\xc3\xbcnster remarked to her brother, after they had taken\r\npossession of the little white house. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been too\r\n_intime_\xe2\x80\x94decidedly too _intime_. Breakfast, dinner, and tea _en\r\nfamille_\xe2\x80\x94it would have been the end of the world if I could have\r\nreached the third day.\xe2\x80\x9d And she made the same observation to her maid\r\nAugustine, an intelligent person, who enjoyed a liberal share of her\r\nconfidence. Felix declared that he would willingly spend his life in\r\nthe bosom of the Wentworth family; that they were the kindest,\r\nsimplest, most amiable people in the world, and that he had taken a\r\nprodigious fancy to them all. The Baroness quite agreed with him that\r\nthey were simple and kind; they were thoroughly nice people, and she\r\nliked them extremely. The girls were perfect ladies; it was impossible\r\nto be more of a lady than Charlotte Wentworth, in spite of her little\r\nvillage air. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as for thinking them the best company in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Baroness, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is another thing; and as for wishing to live\r\n_porte \xc3\xa0 porte_ with them, I should as soon think of wishing myself\r\nback in the convent again, to wear a bombazine apron and sleep in a\r\ndormitory.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet the Baroness was in high good humor; she had been\r\nvery much pleased. With her lively perception and her refined\r\nimagination, she was capable of enjoying anything that was\r\ncharacteristic, anything that was good of its kind. The Wentworth\r\nhousehold seemed to her very perfect in its kind\xe2\x80\x94wonderfully peaceful\r\nand unspotted; pervaded by a sort of dove-colored freshness that had\r\nall the quietude and benevolence of what she deemed to be Quakerism,\r\nand yet seemed to be founded upon a degree of material abundance for\r\nwhich, in certain matters of detail, one might have looked in vain at\r\nthe frugal little court of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. She perceived\r\nimmediately that her American relatives thought and talked very little\r\nabout money; and this of itself made an impression upon Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination. She perceived at the same time that if Charlotte or\r\nGertrude should ask their father for a very considerable sum he would\r\nat once place it in their hands; and this made a still greater\r\nimpression. The greatest impression of all, perhaps, was made by\r\nanother rapid induction. The Baroness had an immediate conviction that\r\nRobert Acton would put his hand into his pocket every day in the week\r\nif that rattle-pated little sister of his should bid him. The men in\r\nthis country, said the Baroness, are evidently very obliging. Her\r\ndeclaration that she was looking for rest and retirement had been by no\r\nmeans wholly untrue; nothing that the Baroness said was wholly untrue.\r\nIt is but fair to add, perhaps, that nothing that she said was wholly\r\ntrue. She wrote to a friend in Germany that it was a return to nature;\r\nit was like drinking new milk, and she was very fond of new milk. She\r\nsaid to herself, of course, that it would be a little dull; but there\r\ncan be no better proof of her good spirits than the fact that she\r\nthought she should not mind its being a little dull. It seemed to her,\r\nwhen from the piazza of her eleemosynary cottage she looked out over\r\nthe soundless fields, the stony pastures, the clear-faced ponds, the\r\nrugged little orchards, that she had never been in the midst of so\r\npeculiarly intense a stillness; it was almost a delicate sensual\r\npleasure. It was all very good, very innocent and safe, and out of it\r\nsomething good must come. Augustine, indeed, who had an unbounded faith\r\nin her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom and far-sightedness, was a great deal\r\nperplexed and depressed. She was always ready to take her cue when she\r\nunderstood it; but she liked to understand it, and on this occasion\r\ncomprehension failed. What, indeed, was the Baroness doing _dans cette\r\ngal\xc3\xa8re_? what fish did she expect to land out of these very stagnant\r\nwaters? The game was evidently a deep one. Augustine could trust her;\r\nbut the sense of walking in the dark betrayed itself in the physiognomy\r\nof this spare, sober, sallow, middle-aged person, who had nothing in\r\ncommon with Gertrude Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s conception of a soubrette, by the most\r\nironical scowl that had ever rested upon the unpretending tokens of the\r\npeace and plenty of the Wentworths. Fortunately, Augustine could quench\r\nskepticism in action. She quite agreed with her mistress\xe2\x80\x94or rather she\r\nquite out-stripped her mistress\xe2\x80\x94in thinking that the little white house\r\nwas pitifully bare. _\xe2\x80\x9cIl faudra,\xe2\x80\x9d_ said Augustine, _\xe2\x80\x9clui faire un peu\r\nde toilette.\xe2\x80\x9d_ And she began to hang up _porti\xc3\xa8res_ in the doorways; to\r\nplace wax candles, procured after some research, in unexpected\r\nsituations; to dispose anomalous draperies over the arms of sofas and\r\nthe backs of chairs. The Baroness had brought with her to the New World\r\na copious provision of the element of costume; and the two Miss\r\nWentworths, when they came over to see her, were somewhat bewildered by\r\nthe obtrusive distribution of her wardrobe. There were India shawls\r\nsuspended, curtain-wise, in the parlor door, and curious fabrics,\r\ncorresponding to Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s metaphysical vision of an opera-cloak,\r\ntumbled about in the sitting-places. There were pink silk blinds in the\r\nwindows, by which the room was strangely bedimmed; and along the\r\nchimney-piece was disposed a remarkable band of velvet, covered with\r\ncoarse, dirty-looking lace. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been making myself a little\r\ncomfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, much to the confusion of Charlotte,\r\nwho had been on the point of proposing to come and help her put her\r\nsuperfluous draperies away. But what Charlotte mistook for an almost\r\nculpably delayed subsidence Gertrude very presently perceived to be the\r\nmost ingenious, the most interesting, the most romantic intention.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is life, indeed, without curtains?\xe2\x80\x9d she secretly asked herself;\r\nand she appeared to herself to have been leading hitherto an existence\r\nsingularly garish and totally devoid of festoons.\r\n\r\nFelix was not a young man who troubled himself greatly about\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94least of all about the conditions of enjoyment. His faculty of\r\nenjoyment was so large, so unconsciously eager, that it may be said of\r\nit that it had a permanent advance upon embarrassment and sorrow. His\r\nsentient faculty was intrinsically joyous, and novelty and change were\r\nin themselves a delight to him. As they had come to him with a great\r\ndeal of frequency, his life had been more agreeable than appeared.\r\nNever was a nature more perfectly fortunate. It was not a restless,\r\napprehensive, ambitious spirit, running a race with the tyranny of\r\nfate, but a temper so unsuspicious as to put Adversity off her guard,\r\ndodging and evading her with the easy, natural motion of a wind-shifted\r\nflower. Felix extracted entertainment from all things, and all his\r\nfaculties\xe2\x80\x94his imagination, his intelligence, his affections, his\r\nsenses\xe2\x80\x94had a hand in the game. It seemed to him that Eugenia and he had\r\nbeen very well treated; there was something absolutely touching in that\r\ncombination of paternal liberality and social considerateness which\r\nmarked Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s deportment. It was most uncommonly kind of him,\r\nfor instance, to have given them a house. Felix was positively amused\r\nat having a house of his own; for the little white cottage among the\r\napple trees\xe2\x80\x94the chalet, as Madame M\xc3\xbcnster always called it\xe2\x80\x94was much\r\nmore sensibly his own than any domiciliary _quatri\xc3\xa8me_, looking upon a\r\ncourt, with the rent overdue. Felix had spent a good deal of his life\r\nin looking into courts, with a perhaps slightly tattered pair of elbows\r\nresting upon the ledge of a high-perched window, and the thin smoke of\r\na cigarette rising into an atmosphere in which street-cries died away\r\nand the vibration of chimes from ancient belfries became sensible. He\r\nhad never known anything so infinitely rural as these New England\r\nfields; and he took a great fancy to all their pastoral roughnesses. He\r\nhad never had a greater sense of luxurious security; and at the risk of\r\nmaking him seem a rather sordid adventurer I must declare that he found\r\nan irresistible charm in the fact that he might dine every day at his\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s. The charm was irresistible, however, because his fancy flung a\r\nrosy light over this homely privilege. He appreciated highly the fare\r\nthat was set before him. There was a kind of fresh-looking abundance\r\nabout it which made him think that people must have lived so in the\r\nmythological era, when they spread their tables upon the grass,\r\nreplenished them from cornucopias, and had no particular need of\r\nkitchen stoves. But the great thing that Felix enjoyed was having found\r\na family\xe2\x80\x94sitting in the midst of gentle, generous people whom he might\r\ncall by their first names. He had never known anything more charming\r\nthan the attention they paid to what he said. It was like a large sheet\r\nof clean, fine-grained drawing-paper, all ready to be washed over with\r\neffective splashes of water-color. He had never had any cousins, and he\r\nhad never before found himself in contact so unrestricted with young\r\nunmarried ladies. He was extremely fond of the society of ladies, and\r\nit was new to him that it might be enjoyed in just this manner. At\r\nfirst he hardly knew what to make of his state of mind. It seemed to\r\nhim that he was in love, indiscriminately, with three girls at once. He\r\nsaw that Lizzie Acton was more brilliantly pretty than Charlotte and\r\nGertrude; but this was scarcely a superiority. His pleasure came from\r\nsomething they had in common\xe2\x80\x94a part of which was, indeed, that physical\r\ndelicacy which seemed to make it proper that they should always dress\r\nin thin materials and clear colors. But they were delicate in other\r\nways, and it was most agreeable to him to feel that these latter\r\ndelicacies were appreciable by contact, as it were. He had known,\r\nfortunately, many virtuous gentlewomen, but it now appeared to him that\r\nin his relations with them (especially when they were unmarried) he had\r\nbeen looking at pictures under glass. He perceived at present what a\r\nnuisance the glass had been\xe2\x80\x94how it perverted and interfered, how it\r\ncaught the reflection of other objects and kept you walking from side\r\nto side. He had no need to ask himself whether Charlotte and Gertrude,\r\nand Lizzie Acton, were in the right light; they were always in the\r\nright light. He liked everything about them: he was, for instance, not\r\nat all above liking the fact that they had very slender feet and high\r\ninsteps. He liked their pretty noses; he liked their surprised eyes and\r\ntheir hesitating, not at all positive way of speaking; he liked so much\r\nknowing that he was perfectly at liberty to be alone for hours,\r\nanywhere, with either of them; that preference for one to the other, as\r\na companion of solitude, remained a minor affair. Charlotte Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsweetly severe features were as agreeable as Lizzie Acton\xe2\x80\x99s wonderfully\r\nexpressive blue eyes; and Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s air of being always ready to walk\r\nabout and listen was as charming as anything else, especially as she\r\nwalked very gracefully. After a while Felix began to distinguish; but\r\neven then he would often wish, suddenly, that they were not all so sad.\r\nEven Lizzie Acton, in spite of her fine little chatter and laughter,\r\nappeared sad. Even Clifford Wentworth, who had extreme youth in his\r\nfavor, and kept a buggy with enormous wheels and a little sorrel mare\r\nwith the prettiest legs in the world\xe2\x80\x94even this fortunate lad was apt to\r\nhave an averted, uncomfortable glance, and to edge away from you at\r\ntimes, in the manner of a person with a bad conscience. The only person\r\nin the circle with no sense of oppression of any kind was, to Felix\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperception, Robert Acton.\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps have been feared that after the completion of those\r\ngraceful domiciliary embellishments which have been mentioned Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster would have found herself confronted with alarming possibilities\r\nof _ennui_. But as yet she had not taken the alarm. The Baroness was a\r\nrestless soul, and she projected her restlessness, as it may be said,\r\ninto any situation that lay before her. Up to a certain point her\r\nrestlessness might be counted upon to entertain her. She was always\r\nexpecting something to happen, and, until it was disappointed,\r\nexpectancy itself was a delicate pleasure. What the Baroness expected\r\njust now it would take some ingenuity to set forth; it is enough that\r\nwhile she looked about her she found something to occupy her\r\nimagination. She assured herself that she was enchanted with her new\r\nrelatives; she professed to herself that, like her brother, she felt it\r\na sacred satisfaction to have found a family. It is certain that she\r\nenjoyed to the utmost the gentleness of her kinsfolk\xe2\x80\x99s deference. She\r\nhad, first and last, received a great deal of admiration, and her\r\nexperience of well-turned compliments was very considerable; but she\r\nknew that she had never been so real a power, never counted for so\r\nmuch, as now when, for the first time, the standard of comparison of\r\nher little circle was a prey to vagueness. The sense, indeed, that the\r\ngood people about her had, as regards her remarkable self, no standard\r\nof comparison at all gave her a feeling of almost illimitable power. It\r\nwas true, as she said to herself, that if for this reason they would be\r\nable to discover nothing against her, so they would perhaps neglect to\r\nperceive some of her superior points; but she always wound up her\r\nreflections by declaring that she would take care of that.\r\n\r\nCharlotte and Gertrude were in some perplexity between their desire to\r\nshow all proper attention to Madame M\xc3\xbcnster and their fear of being\r\nimportunate. The little house in the orchard had hitherto been occupied\r\nduring the summer months by intimate friends of the family, or by poor\r\nrelations who found in Mr. Wentworth a landlord attentive to repairs\r\nand oblivious of quarter-day. Under these circumstances the open door\r\nof the small house and that of the large one, facing each other across\r\ntheir homely gardens, levied no tax upon hourly visits. But the Misses\r\nWentworth received an impression that Eugenia was no friend to the\r\nprimitive custom of \xe2\x80\x9cdropping in;\xe2\x80\x9d she evidently had no idea of living\r\nwithout a door-keeper. \xe2\x80\x9cOne goes into your house as into an inn\xe2\x80\x94except\r\nthat there are no servants rushing forward,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Charlotte. And\r\nshe added that that was very charming. Gertrude explained to her sister\r\nthat she meant just the reverse; she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it at all. Charlotte\r\ninquired why she should tell an untruth, and Gertrude answered that\r\nthere was probably some very good reason for it which they should\r\ndiscover when they knew her better. \xe2\x80\x9cThere can surely be no good reason\r\nfor telling an untruth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope she does not think\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had of course desired, from the first, to do everything in the way\r\nof helping her to arrange herself. It had seemed to Charlotte that\r\nthere would be a great many things to talk about; but the Baroness was\r\napparently inclined to talk about nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite her a note, asking her leave to come and see her. I think that\r\nis what she will like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I give her the trouble of answering me?\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will have to write a note and send it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think she will take any trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, profoundly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then will she do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I am curious to see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, leaving her sister\r\nwith an impression that her curiosity was morbid.\r\n\r\nThey went to see the Baroness without preliminary correspondence; and\r\nin the little salon which she had already created, with its becoming\r\nlight and its festoons, they found Robert Acton.\r\n\r\nEugenia was intensely gracious, but she accused them of neglecting her\r\ncruelly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see Mr. Acton has had to take pity upon me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother goes off sketching, for hours; I can never depend upon him.\r\nSo I was to send Mr. Acton to beg you to come and give me the benefit\r\nof your wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at her sister. She wanted to say, \xe2\x80\x9c_That_ is what she\r\nwould have done.\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte said that they hoped the Baroness would\r\nalways come and dine with them; it would give them so much pleasure;\r\nand, in that case, she would spare herself the trouble of having a\r\ncook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but I must have a cook!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cAn old negress in a\r\nyellow turban. I have set my heart upon that. I want to look out of my\r\nwindow and see her sitting there on the grass, against the background\r\nof those crooked, dusky little apple trees, pulling the husks off a\r\nlapful of Indian corn. That will be local color, you know. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmuch of it here\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying that, do you?\xe2\x80\x94so one must make\r\nthe most of what one can get. I shall be most happy to dine with you\r\nwhenever you will let me; but I want to be able to ask you sometimes.\r\nAnd I want to be able to ask Mr. Acton,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must come and ask me at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must come and see\r\nme; you must dine with me first. I want to show you my place; I want to\r\nintroduce you to my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d He called again upon Madame M\xc3\xbcnster, two\r\ndays later. He was constantly at the other house; he used to walk\r\nacross the fields from his own place, and he appeared to have fewer\r\nscruples than his cousins with regard to dropping in. On this occasion\r\nhe found that Mr. Brand had come to pay his respects to the charming\r\nstranger; but after Acton\xe2\x80\x99s arrival the young theologian said nothing.\r\nHe sat in his chair with his two hands clasped, fixing upon his hostess\r\na grave, fascinated stare. The Baroness talked to Robert Acton, but, as\r\nshe talked, she turned and smiled at Mr. Brand, who never took his eyes\r\noff her. The two men walked away together; they were going to Mr.\r\nWentworth\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr. Brand still said nothing; but after they had passed\r\ninto Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s garden he stopped and looked back for some time at\r\nthe little white house. Then, looking at his companion, with his head\r\nbent a little to one side and his eyes somewhat contracted, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\r\nsuppose that\xe2\x80\x99s what is called conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9creal\r\nconversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what I call a very clever woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is most interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI only wish she would\r\nspeak French; it would seem more in keeping. It must be quite the style\r\nthat we have heard about, that we have read about\xe2\x80\x94the style of\r\nconversation of Madame de Sta\xc3\xabl, of Madame R\xc3\xa9camier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon also looked at Madame M\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s residence among its hollyhocks\r\nand apple trees. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I should like to know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\njust what has brought Madame R\xc3\xa9camier to live in that place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth, with his cane and his gloves in his hand, went every\r\nafternoon to call upon his niece. A couple of hours later she came over\r\nto the great house to tea. She had let the proposal that she should\r\nregularly dine there fall to the ground; she was in the enjoyment of\r\nwhatever satisfaction was to be derived from the spectacle of an old\r\nnegress in a crimson turban shelling peas under the apple trees.\r\nCharlotte, who had provided the ancient negress, thought it must be a\r\nstrange household, Eugenia having told her that Augustine managed\r\neverything, the ancient negress included\xe2\x80\x94Augustine who was naturally\r\ndevoid of all acquaintance with the expurgatory English tongue. By far\r\nthe most immoral sentiment which I shall have occasion to attribute to\r\nCharlotte Wentworth was a certain emotion of disappointment at finding\r\nthat, in spite of these irregular conditions, the domestic arrangements\r\nat the small house were apparently not\xe2\x80\x94from Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar point of\r\nview\xe2\x80\x94strikingly offensive. The Baroness found it amusing to go to tea;\r\nshe dressed as if for dinner. The tea-table offered an anomalous and\r\npicturesque repast; and on leaving it they all sat and talked in the\r\nlarge piazza, or wandered about the garden in the starlight, with their\r\nears full of those sounds of strange insects which, though they are\r\nsupposed to be, all over the world, a part of the magic of summer\r\nnights, seemed to the Baroness to have beneath these western skies an\r\nincomparable resonance.\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth, though, as I say, he went punctiliously to call upon\r\nher, was not able to feel that he was getting used to his niece. It\r\ntaxed his imagination to believe that she was really his half-sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchild. His sister was a figure of his early years; she had been only\r\ntwenty when she went abroad, never to return, making in foreign parts a\r\nwillful and undesirable marriage. His aunt, Mrs. Whiteside, who had\r\ntaken her to Europe for the benefit of the tour, gave, on her return,\r\nso lamentable an account of Mr. Adolphus Young, to whom the headstrong\r\ngirl had united her destiny, that it operated as a chill upon family\r\nfeeling\xe2\x80\x94especially in the case of the half-brothers. Catherine had done\r\nnothing subsequently to propitiate her family; she had not even written\r\nto them in a way that indicated a lucid appreciation of their suspended\r\nsympathy; so that it had become a tradition in Boston circles that the\r\nhighest charity, as regards this young lady, was to think it well to\r\nforget her, and to abstain from conjecture as to the extent to which\r\nher aberrations were reproduced in her descendants. Over these young\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94a vague report of their existence had come to his ears\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nWentworth had not, in the course of years, allowed his imagination to\r\nhover. It had plenty of occupation nearer home, and though he had many\r\ncares upon his conscience the idea that he had been an unnatural uncle\r\nwas, very properly, never among the number. Now that his nephew and\r\nniece had come before him, he perceived that they were the fruit of\r\ninfluences and circumstances very different from those under which his\r\nown familiar progeny had reached a vaguely-qualified maturity. He felt\r\nno provocation to say that these influences had been exerted for evil;\r\nbut he was sometimes afraid that he should not be able to like his\r\ndistinguished, delicate, lady-like niece. He was paralyzed and\r\nbewildered by her foreignness. She spoke, somehow, a different\r\nlanguage. There was something strange in her words. He had a feeling\r\nthat another man, in his place, would accommodate himself to her tone;\r\nwould ask her questions and joke with her, reply to those pleasantries\r\nof her own which sometimes seemed startling as addressed to an uncle.\r\nBut Mr. Wentworth could not do these things. He could not even bring\r\nhimself to attempt to measure her position in the world. She was the\r\nwife of a foreign nobleman who desired to repudiate her. This had a\r\nsingular sound, but the old man felt himself destitute of the materials\r\nfor a judgment. It seemed to him that he ought to find them in his own\r\nexperience, as a man of the world and an almost public character; but\r\nthey were not there, and he was ashamed to confess to himself\xe2\x80\x94much more\r\nto reveal to Eugenia by interrogations possibly too innocent\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nunfurnished condition of this repository.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to him that he could get much nearer, as he would have\r\nsaid, to his nephew; though he was not sure that Felix was altogether\r\nsafe. He was so bright and handsome and talkative that it was\r\nimpossible not to think well of him; and yet it seemed as if there were\r\nsomething almost impudent, almost vicious\xe2\x80\x94or as if there ought to be\xe2\x80\x94in\r\na young man being at once so joyous and so positive. It was to be\r\nobserved that while Felix was not at all a serious young man there was\r\nsomehow more of him\xe2\x80\x94he had more weight and volume and resonance\xe2\x80\x94than a\r\nnumber of young men who were distinctly serious. While Mr. Wentworth\r\nmeditated upon this anomaly his nephew was admiring him unrestrictedly.\r\nHe thought him a most delicate, generous, high-toned old gentleman,\r\nwith a very handsome head, of the ascetic type, which he promised\r\nhimself the profit of sketching. Felix was far from having made a\r\nsecret of the fact that he wielded the paint-brush, and it was not his\r\nown fault if it failed to be generally understood that he was prepared\r\nto execute the most striking likenesses on the most reasonable terms.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an artist\xe2\x80\x94my cousin is an artist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude; and she\r\noffered this information to everyone who would receive it. She offered\r\nit to herself, as it were, by way of admonition and reminder; she\r\nrepeated to herself at odd moments, in lonely places, that Felix was\r\ninvested with this sacred character. Gertrude had never seen an artist\r\nbefore; she had only read about such people. They seemed to her a\r\nromantic and mysterious class, whose life was made up of those\r\nagreeable accidents that never happened to other persons. And it merely\r\nquickened her meditations on this point that Felix should declare, as\r\nhe repeatedly did, that he was really not an artist. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never gone\r\ninto the thing seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never studied; I have had\r\nno training. I do a little of everything, and nothing well. I am only\r\nan amateur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt pleased Gertrude even more to think that he was an amateur than to\r\nthink that he was an artist; the former word, to her fancy, had an even\r\nsubtler connotation. She knew, however, that it was a word to use more\r\nsoberly. Mr. Wentworth used it freely; for though he had not been\r\nexactly familiar with it, he found it convenient as a help toward\r\nclassifying Felix, who, as a young man extremely clever and active and\r\napparently respectable and yet not engaged in any recognized business,\r\nwas an importunate anomaly. Of course the Baroness and her brother\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwas always spoken of first\xe2\x80\x94were a welcome topic of conversation between\r\nMr. Wentworth and his daughters and their occasional visitors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the young man, your nephew, what is his profession?\xe2\x80\x9d asked an old\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Broderip, of Salem\xe2\x80\x94who had been Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s classmate\r\nat Harvard College in the year 1809, and who came into his office in\r\nDevonshire Street. (Mr. Wentworth, in his later years, used to go but\r\nthree times a week to his office, where he had a large amount of highly\r\nconfidential trust-business to transact.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s an amateur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, with folded hands, and\r\nwith a certain satisfaction in being able to say it. And Mr. Broderip\r\nhad gone back to Salem with a feeling that this was probably a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEuropean\xe2\x80\x9d expression for a broker or a grain exporter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to do your head, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix to his uncle one\r\nevening, before them all\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Brand and Robert Acton being also present.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I should make a very fine thing of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting\r\nhead; it\xe2\x80\x99s very mediaeval.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth looked grave; he felt awkwardly, as if all the company\r\nhad come in and found him standing before the looking-glass. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord\r\nmade it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is for man to make it over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly the Lord made it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felix, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cand he made it\r\nvery well. But life has been touching up the work. It is a very\r\ninteresting type of head. It\xe2\x80\x99s delightfully wasted and emaciated. The\r\ncomplexion is wonderfully bleached.\xe2\x80\x9d And Felix looked round at the\r\ncircle, as if to call their attention to these interesting points. Mr.\r\nWentworth grew visibly paler. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to do you as an old\r\nprelate, an old cardinal, or the prior of an order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA prelate, a cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mr. Wentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you refer to the\r\nRoman Catholic priesthood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean an old ecclesiastic who should have led a very pure, abstinent\r\nlife. Now I take it that has been the case with you, sir; one sees it\r\nin your face,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been very\xe2\x80\x94a very moderate.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think one always sees that in a man\xe2\x80\x99s face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see more in a man\xe2\x80\x99s face than I should think of looking for,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Wentworth coldly.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness rattled her fan, and gave her brilliant laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nrisk to look so close!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle has some peccadilloes\r\non his conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth looked at her, painfully at a loss;\r\nand in so far as the signs of a pure and abstinent life were visible in\r\nhis face they were then probably peculiarly manifest. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a _beau\r\nvieillard_, dear uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame M\xc3\xbcnster, smiling with her foreign\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are paying me a compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, I am not the first woman that ever did so!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nBaroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth gravely. And turning to Felix he\r\nadded, in the same tone, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t take my likeness. My children\r\nhave my daguerreotype. That is quite satisfactory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to work your head into something!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth looked at him and then at all the others; then he got up\r\nand slowly walked away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelix,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, in the silence that followed, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would\r\npaint my portrait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte wondered whether Gertrude was right in wishing this; and she\r\nlooked at Mr. Brand as the most legitimate way of ascertaining.\r\nWhatever Gertrude did or said, Charlotte always looked at Mr. Brand. It\r\nwas a standing pretext for looking at Mr. Brand\xe2\x80\x94always, as Charlotte\r\nthought, in the interest of Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s welfare. It is true that she\r\nfelt a tremulous interest in Gertrude being right; for Charlotte, in\r\nher small, still way, was an heroic sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should be glad to have your portrait, Miss Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBrand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be delighted to paint so charming a model,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you are so lovely, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lizzie Acton, with her\r\nlittle inoffensive pertness, biting off a knot in her knitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not because I think I am beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, looking all\r\nround. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am beautiful, at all.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with a sort of\r\nconscious deliberateness; and it seemed very strange to Charlotte to\r\nhear her discussing this question so publicly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because I think\r\nit would be amusing to sit and be painted. I have always thought that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you have not had better things to think about, my\r\ndaughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very beautiful, cousin Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cI put all the compliments I\r\nreceive into a little money-jug that has a slit in the side. I shake\r\nthem up and down, and they rattle. There are not many yet\xe2\x80\x94only two or\r\nthree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cSee; I am careful not to\r\ngive it the form of a compliment. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you were beautiful at\r\nfirst. But you have come to seem so little by little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, now, your jug doesn\xe2\x80\x99t burst!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lizzie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think sitting for one\xe2\x80\x99s portrait is only one of the various forms of\r\nidleness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir name is legion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t be said to be idle when you are\r\nmaking a man work so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne might be painted while one is asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Brand, as a\r\ncontribution to the discussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, do paint me while I am asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude to Felix, smiling.\r\nAnd she closed her eyes a little. It had by this time become a matter\r\nof almost exciting anxiety to Charlotte what Gertrude would say or\r\nwould do next.\r\n\r\nShe began to sit for her portrait on the following day\xe2\x80\x94in the open air,\r\non the north side of the piazza. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would tell me what you\r\nthink of us\xe2\x80\x94how we seem to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Felix, as he sat before\r\nhis easel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to me the best people in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it saves you the trouble of\r\nsaying anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man glanced at her over the top of his canvas. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat else\r\nshould I say? It would certainly be a great deal of trouble to say\r\nanything different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have seen people before that you have\r\nliked, have you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I have, thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they have been very different from us,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat only proves,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there are a thousand different\r\nways of being good company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think us good company?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompany for a king!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude was silent a moment; and then, \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be a thousand\r\ndifferent ways of being dreary,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand sometimes I think we\r\nmake use of them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix stood up quickly, holding up his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could only keep\r\nthat look on your face for half an hour\xe2\x80\x94while I catch it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis uncommonly handsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo look handsome for half an hour\xe2\x80\x94that is a great deal to ask of me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be the portrait of a young woman who has taken some vow, some\r\npledge, that she repents of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cand who is thinking it over\r\nat leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have taken no vow, no pledge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, very gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nnothing to repent of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear cousin, that was only a figure of speech. I am very sure that\r\nno one in your excellent family has anything to repent of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet we are always repenting!\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I\r\nmean by our being dreary. You know it perfectly well; you only pretend\r\nthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix gave a quick laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cThe half hour is going on, and yet you are\r\nhandsomer than ever. One must be careful what one says, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can say anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix looked at her, as an artist might, and painted for some time in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you seem to me different from your father and sister\xe2\x80\x94from most of\r\nthe people you have lived with,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo say that one\xe2\x80\x99s self,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis like saying\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nimplication, at least\xe2\x80\x94that one is better. I am not better; I am much\r\nworse. But they say themselves that I am different. It makes them\r\nunhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you accuse me of concealing my real impressions, I may admit\r\nthat I think the tendency\xe2\x80\x94among you generally\xe2\x80\x94is to be made unhappy too\r\neasily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would tell that to my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might make him more unhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix exclaimed, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly would. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you have seen people like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear cousin, how do you know what I have seen?\xe2\x80\x9d Felix demanded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might tell me a great many things, if you only would. You have\r\nseen people like yourself\xe2\x80\x94people who are bright and gay and fond of\r\namusement. We are not fond of amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cI confess that rather strikes me. You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to\r\nme to get all the pleasure out of life that you might. You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nto me to enjoy..... Do you mind my saying this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, pausing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to me very well placed for enjoying. You have money and\r\nliberty and what is called in Europe a \xe2\x80\x98position.\xe2\x80\x99 But you take a\r\npainful view of life, as one may say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne ought to think it bright and charming and delightful, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nGertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say so\xe2\x80\x94if one can. It is true it all depends upon that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFelix added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know there is a great deal of misery in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said his\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen a little of it,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was all\r\nover there\xe2\x80\x94beyond the sea. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any here. This is a paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude said nothing; she sat looking at the dahlias and the\r\ncurrant-bushes in the garden, while Felix went on with his work. \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\n\xe2\x80\x98enjoy,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she began at last, \xe2\x80\x9cto take life\xe2\x80\x94not painfully, must one do\r\nsomething wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix gave his long, light laugh again. \xe2\x80\x9cSeriously, I think not. And\r\nfor this reason, among others: you strike me as very capable of\r\nenjoying, if the chance were given you, and yet at the same time as\r\nincapable of wrong-doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are very wrong in telling a\r\nperson that she is incapable of that. We are never nearer to evil than\r\nwhen we believe that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are handsomer than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Felix, irrelevantly.\r\n\r\nGertrude had got used to hearing him say this. There was not so much\r\nexcitement in it as at first. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat ought one to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo give parties, to go to the theatre, to read novels, to keep late\r\nhours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s what one does or one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do that promotes\r\nenjoyment,\xe2\x80\x9d her companion answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the general way of looking\r\nat life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look at it as a discipline\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what they do here. I have often\r\nbeen told that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s very good. But there is another way,\xe2\x80\x9d added Felix,\r\nsmiling: \xe2\x80\x9cto look at it as an opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn opportunity\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cOne would get more pleasure that\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to say anything better for it than that it has been my\r\nown way\xe2\x80\x94and that is not saying much!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix had laid down his palette\r\nand brushes; he was leaning back, with his arms folded, to judge the\r\neffect of his work. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a very petty\r\npersonage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a great deal of talent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man rejoined, in a tone of cheerful impartiality, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave not a great deal of talent. It is nothing at all remarkable. I\r\nassure you I should know if it were. I shall always be obscure. The\r\nworld will never hear of me.\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude looked at him with a strange\r\nfeeling. She was thinking of the great world which he knew and which\r\nshe did not, and how full of brilliant talents it must be, since it\r\ncould afford to make light of his abilities. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t in general\r\nattach much importance to anything I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\nmay believe me when I say this,\xe2\x80\x94that I am little better than a\r\ngood-natured feather-head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA feather-head?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a species of Bohemian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Bohemian?\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude had never heard this term before, save as a\r\ngeographical denomination; and she quite failed to understand the\r\nfigurative meaning which her companion appeared to attach to it. But it\r\ngave her pleasure.\r\n\r\nFelix had pushed back his chair and risen to his feet; he slowly came\r\ntoward her, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a sort of adventurer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking down\r\nat her.\r\n\r\nShe got up, meeting his smile. \xe2\x80\x9cAn adventurer?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nlike to hear your adventures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor an instant she believed that he was going to take her hand; but he\r\ndropped his own hands suddenly into the pockets of his painting-jacket.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been an\r\nadventurer, but my adventures have been very innocent. They have all\r\nbeen happy ones; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are any I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell. They\r\nwere very pleasant and very pretty; I should like to go over them in\r\nmemory. Sit down again, and I will begin,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a moment, with\r\nhis naturally persuasive smile.\r\n\r\nGertrude sat down again on that day, and she sat down on several other\r\ndays. Felix, while he plied his brush, told her a great many stories,\r\nand she listened with charmed avidity. Her eyes rested upon his lips;\r\nshe was very serious; sometimes, from her air of wondering gravity, he\r\nthought she was displeased. But Felix never believed for more than a\r\nsingle moment in any displeasure of his own producing. This would have\r\nbeen fatuity if the optimism it expressed had not been much more a hope\r\nthan a prejudice. It is beside the matter to say that he had a good\r\nconscience; for the best conscience is a sort of self-reproach, and\r\nthis young man\xe2\x80\x99s brilliantly healthy nature spent itself in objective\r\ngood intentions which were ignorant of any test save exactness in\r\nhitting their mark. He told Gertrude how he had walked over France and\r\nItaly with a painter\xe2\x80\x99s knapsack on his back, paying his way often by\r\nknocking off a flattering portrait of his host or hostess. He told her\r\nhow he had played the violin in a little band of musicians\xe2\x80\x94not of high\r\ncelebrity\xe2\x80\x94who traveled through foreign lands giving provincial\r\nconcerts. He told her also how he had been a momentary ornament of a\r\ntroupe of strolling actors, engaged in the arduous task of interpreting\r\nShakespeare to French and German, Polish and Hungarian audiences.\r\n\r\nWhile this periodical recital was going on, Gertrude lived in a\r\nfantastic world; she seemed to herself to be reading a romance that\r\ncame out in daily numbers. She had known nothing so delightful since\r\nthe perusal of _Nicholas Nickleby_. One afternoon she went to see her\r\ncousin, Mrs. Acton, Robert\xe2\x80\x99s mother, who was a great invalid, never\r\nleaving the house. She came back alone, on foot, across the fields\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nbeing a short way which they often used. Felix had gone to Boston with\r\nher father, who desired to take the young man to call upon some of his\r\nfriends, old gentlemen who remembered his mother\xe2\x80\x94remembered her, but\r\nsaid nothing about her\xe2\x80\x94and several of whom, with the gentle ladies\r\ntheir wives, had driven out from town to pay their respects at the\r\nlittle house among the apple trees, in vehicles which reminded the\r\nBaroness, who received her visitors with discriminating civility, of\r\nthe large, light, rattling barouche in which she herself had made her\r\njourney to this neighborhood. The afternoon was waning; in the western\r\nsky the great picture of a New England sunset, painted in crimson and\r\nsilver, was suspended from the zenith; and the stony pastures, as\r\nGertrude traversed them, thinking intently to herself, were covered\r\nwith a light, clear glow. At the open gate of one of the fields she saw\r\nfrom the distance a man\xe2\x80\x99s figure; he stood there as if he were waiting\r\nfor her, and as she came nearer she recognized Mr. Brand. She had a\r\nfeeling as of not having seen him for some time; she could not have\r\nsaid for how long, for it yet seemed to her that he had been very\r\nlately at the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I walk back with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. And when she had said that he\r\nmight if he wanted, he observed that he had seen her and recognized her\r\nhalf a mile away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have very good eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have very good eyes, Miss Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand. She\r\nperceived that he meant something; but for a long time past Mr. Brand\r\nhad constantly meant something, and she had almost got used to it. She\r\nfelt, however, that what he meant had now a renewed power to disturb\r\nher, to perplex and agitate her. He walked beside her in silence for a\r\nmoment, and then he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had no trouble in seeing that you\r\nare beginning to avoid me. But perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cone needn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nhad very good eyes to see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not avoided you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, without looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you have been unconscious that you were avoiding me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nBrand replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not even known that I was there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are here now, Mr. Brand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, with a little\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no rejoinder. He simply walked beside her slowly, as they were\r\nobliged to walk over the soft grass. Presently they came to another\r\ngate, which was closed. Mr. Brand laid his hand upon it, but he made no\r\nmovement to open it; he stood and looked at his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nvery much interested\xe2\x80\x94very much absorbed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nGertrude glanced at him; she saw that he was pale and that he looked\r\nexcited. She had never seen Mr. Brand excited before, and she felt that\r\nthe spectacle, if fully carried out, would be impressive, almost\r\npainful. \xe2\x80\x9cAbsorbed in what?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. Then she looked away at the\r\nilluminated sky. She felt guilty and uncomfortable, and yet she was\r\nvexed with herself for feeling so. But Mr. Brand, as he stood there\r\nlooking at her with his small, kind, persistent eyes, represented an\r\nimmense body of half-obliterated obligations, that were rising again\r\ninto a certain distinctness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have new interests, new occupations,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthat I can say that you have new duties. We have always old ones,\r\nGertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease open the gate, Mr. Brand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and she felt as if, in\r\nsaying so, she were cowardly and petulant. But he opened the gate, and\r\nallowed her to pass; then he closed it behind himself. Before she had\r\ntime to turn away he put out his hand and held her an instant by the\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to say something to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you want to say,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. And she was on the point\r\nof adding, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I know just how you will say it;\xe2\x80\x9d but these words she\r\nkept back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you, Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you very much; I love you more\r\nthan ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said the words just as she had known he would; she had heard them\r\nbefore. They had no charm for her; she had said to herself before that\r\nit was very strange. It was supposed to be delightful for a woman to\r\nlisten to such words; but these seemed to her flat and mechanical. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish you would forget that,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I\xe2\x80\x94why should I?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made you no promise\xe2\x80\x94given you no pledge,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at\r\nhim, with her voice trembling a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have let me feel that I have an influence over you. You have\r\nopened your mind to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never opened my mind to you, Mr. Brand!\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude cried, with some\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you were not so frank as I thought\xe2\x80\x94as we all thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what anyone else had to do with it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean your father and your sister. You know it makes them happy to\r\nthink you will listen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make them happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing makes them happy. No one is happy here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think your cousin is very happy\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Young,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Brand, in a\r\nsoft, almost timid tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better for him!\xe2\x80\x9d And Gertrude gave her little laugh again.\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at her a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very much changed,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not. I have known you a long time, and I have loved you as you\r\nwere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be going home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe on his side, gave a little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly do avoid me\xe2\x80\x94you see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvoid me, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her again; and then, very gently, \xe2\x80\x9cNo I will not avoid\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will leave you, for the present, to yourself.\r\nI think you will remember\xe2\x80\x94after a while\xe2\x80\x94some of the things you have\r\nforgotten. I think you will come back to me; I have great faith in\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time his voice was very touching; there was a strong, reproachful\r\nforce in what he said, and Gertrude could answer nothing. He turned\r\naway and stood there, leaning his elbows on the gate and looking at the\r\nbeautiful sunset. Gertrude left him and took her way home again; but\r\nwhen she reached the middle of the next field she suddenly burst into\r\ntears. Her tears seemed to her to have been a long time gathering, and\r\nfor some moments it was a kind of glee to shed them. But they presently\r\npassed away. There was something a little hard about Gertrude; and she\r\nnever wept again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing of an afternoon to call upon his niece, Mr. Wentworth more than\r\nonce found Robert Acton sitting in her little drawing-room. This was in\r\nno degree, to Mr. Wentworth, a perturbing fact, for he had no sense of\r\ncompeting with his young kinsman for Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s good graces. Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s uncle had the highest opinion of Robert Acton, who, indeed,\r\nin the family at large, was the object of a great deal of\r\nundemonstrative appreciation. They were all proud of him, in so far as\r\nthe charge of being proud may be brought against people who were,\r\nhabitually, distinctly guiltless of the misdemeanor known as \xe2\x80\x9ctaking\r\ncredit.\xe2\x80\x9d They never boasted of Robert Acton, nor indulged in\r\nvainglorious reference to him; they never quoted the clever things he\r\nhad said, nor mentioned the generous things he had done. But a sort of\r\nfrigidly-tender faith in his unlimited goodness was a part of their\r\npersonal sense of right; and there can, perhaps, be no better proof of\r\nthe high esteem in which he was held than the fact that no explicit\r\njudgment was ever passed upon his actions. He was no more praised than\r\nhe was blamed; but he was tacitly felt to be an ornament to his circle.\r\nHe was the man of the world of the family. He had been to China and\r\nbrought home a collection of curiosities; he had made a fortune\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nrather he had quintupled a fortune already considerable; he was\r\ndistinguished by that combination of celibacy, \xe2\x80\x9cproperty,\xe2\x80\x9d and good\r\nhumor which appeals to even the most subdued imaginations; and it was\r\ntaken for granted that he would presently place these advantages at the\r\ndisposal of some well-regulated young woman of his own \xe2\x80\x9cset.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nWentworth was not a man to admit to himself that\xe2\x80\x94his paternal duties\r\napart\xe2\x80\x94he liked any individual much better than all other individuals;\r\nbut he thought Robert Acton extremely judicious; and this was perhaps\r\nas near an approach as he was capable of to the eagerness of\r\npreference, which his temperament repudiated as it would have\r\ndisengaged itself from something slightly unchaste. Acton was, in fact,\r\nvery judicious\xe2\x80\x94and something more beside; and indeed it must be claimed\r\nfor Mr. Wentworth that in the more illicit parts of his preference\r\nthere hovered the vague adumbration of a belief that his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s final\r\nmerit was a certain enviable capacity for whistling, rather gallantly,\r\nat the sanctions of mere judgment\xe2\x80\x94for showing a larger courage, a finer\r\nquality of pluck, than common occasion demanded. Mr. Wentworth would\r\nnever have risked the intimation that Acton was made, in the smallest\r\ndegree, of the stuff of a hero; but this is small blame to him, for\r\nRobert would certainly never have risked it himself. Acton certainly\r\nexercised great discretion in all things\xe2\x80\x94beginning with his estimate of\r\nhimself. He knew that he was by no means so much of a man of the world\r\nas he was supposed to be in local circles; but it must be added that he\r\nknew also that his natural shrewdness had a reach of which he had never\r\nquite given local circles the measure. He was addicted to taking the\r\nhumorous view of things, and he had discovered that even in the\r\nnarrowest circles such a disposition may find frequent opportunities.\r\nSuch opportunities had formed for some time\xe2\x80\x94that is, since his return\r\nfrom China, a year and a half before\xe2\x80\x94the most active element in this\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s life, which had just now a rather indolent air. He was\r\nperfectly willing to get married. He was very fond of books, and he had\r\na handsome library; that is, his books were much more numerous than Mr.\r\nWentworth\xe2\x80\x99s. He was also very fond of pictures; but it must be\r\nconfessed, in the fierce light of contemporary criticism, that his\r\nwalls were adorned with several rather abortive masterpieces. He had\r\ngot his learning\xe2\x80\x94and there was more of it than commonly appeared\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nHarvard College; and he took a pleasure in old associations, which made\r\nit a part of his daily contentment to live so near this institution\r\nthat he often passed it in driving to Boston. He was extremely\r\ninterested in the Baroness M\xc3\xbcnster.\r\n\r\nShe was very frank with him; or at least she intended to be. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure\r\nyou find it very strange that I should have settled down in this\r\nout-of-the-way part of the world!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him three or four weeks\r\nafter she had installed herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI am certain you are wondering about\r\nmy motives. They are very pure.\xe2\x80\x9d The Baroness by this time was an old\r\ninhabitant; the best society in Boston had called upon her, and\r\nClifford Wentworth had taken her several times to drive in his buggy.\r\n\r\nRobert Acton was seated near her, playing with a fan; there were always\r\nseveral fans lying about her drawing-room, with long ribbons of\r\ndifferent colors attached to them, and Acton was always playing with\r\none. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t find it at all strange,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, smiling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat a clever woman should turn up in Boston, or its suburbs\xe2\x80\x94that does\r\nnot require so much explanation. Boston is a very nice place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to make me contradict you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, \xe2\x80\x9c_vous vous\r\ny prenez mal_. In certain moods there is nothing I am not capable of\r\nagreeing to. Boston is a paradise, and we are in the suburbs of\r\nParadise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust now I am not at all in the suburbs; I am in the place itself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrejoined Acton, who was lounging a little in his chair. He was,\r\nhowever, not always lounging; and when he was he was not quite so\r\nrelaxed as he pretended. To a certain extent, he sought refuge from\r\nshyness in this appearance of relaxation; and like many persons in the\r\nsame circumstances he somewhat exaggerated the appearance. Beyond this,\r\nthe air of being much at his ease was a cover for vigilant observation.\r\nHe was more than interested in this clever woman, who, whatever he\r\nmight say, was clever not at all after the Boston fashion; she plunged\r\nhim into a kind of excitement, held him in vague suspense. He was\r\nobliged to admit to himself that he had never yet seen a woman just\r\nlike this\xe2\x80\x94not even in China. He was ashamed, for inscrutable reasons,\r\nof the vivacity of his emotion, and he carried it off, superficially,\r\nby taking, still superficially, the humorous view of Madame M\xc3\xbcnster. It\r\nwas not at all true that he thought it very natural of her to have made\r\nthis pious pilgrimage. It might have been said of him in advance that\r\nhe was too good a Bostonian to regard in the light of an eccentricity\r\nthe desire of even the remotest alien to visit the New England\r\nmetropolis. This was an impulse for which, surely, no apology was\r\nneeded; and Madame M\xc3\xbcnster was the fortunate possessor of several New\r\nEngland cousins. In fact, however, Madame M\xc3\xbcnster struck him as out of\r\nkeeping with her little circle; she was at the best a very agreeable, a\r\ngracefully mystifying anomaly. He knew very well that it would not do\r\nto address these reflections too crudely to Mr. Wentworth; he would\r\nnever have remarked to the old gentleman that he wondered what the\r\nBaroness was up to. And indeed he had no great desire to share his\r\nvague mistrust with anyone. There was a personal pleasure in it; the\r\ngreatest pleasure he had known at least since he had come from China.\r\nHe would keep the Baroness, for better or worse, to himself; he had a\r\nfeeling that he deserved to enjoy a monopoly of her, for he was\r\ncertainly the person who had most adequately gauged her capacity for\r\nsocial intercourse. Before long it became apparent to him that the\r\nBaroness was disposed to lay no tax upon such a monopoly.\r\n\r\nOne day (he was sitting there again and playing with a fan) she asked\r\nhim to apologize, should the occasion present itself, to certain people\r\nin Boston for her not having returned their calls. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are half a\r\ndozen places,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9ca formidable list. Charlotte Wentworth has\r\nwritten it out for me, in a terrifically distinct hand. There is no\r\nambiguity on the subject; I know perfectly where I must go. Mr.\r\nWentworth informs me that the carriage is always at my disposal, and\r\nCharlotte offers to go with me, in a pair of tight gloves and a very\r\nstiff petticoat. And yet for three days I have been putting it off.\r\nThey must think me horribly vicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask me to apologize,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me what\r\nexcuse I can offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is more,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness declared, \xe2\x80\x9cthan I am held to. It would be\r\nlike my asking you to buy me a bouquet and giving you the money. I have\r\nno reason except that\xe2\x80\x94somehow\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too violent an effort. It is not\r\ninspiring. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that serve as an excuse, in Boston? I am told they\r\nare very sincere; they don\xe2\x80\x99t tell fibs. And then Felix ought to go with\r\nme, and he is never in readiness. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see him. He is always roaming\r\nabout the fields and sketching old barns, or taking ten-mile walks, or\r\npainting someone\xe2\x80\x99s portrait, or rowing on the pond, or flirting with\r\nGertrude Wentworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it would amuse you to go and see a few people,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nActon. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are having a very quiet time of it here. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dull life\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the quiet,\xe2\x80\x94the quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nlike. It\xe2\x80\x99s rest. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I came here for. Amusement? I have had\r\namusement. And as for seeing people\xe2\x80\x94I have already seen a great many in\r\nmy life. If it didn\xe2\x80\x99t sound ungracious I should say that I wish very\r\nhumbly your people here would leave me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon looked at her a moment, and she looked at him. She was a woman\r\nwho took being looked at remarkably well. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you have come here for\r\nrest?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I may say. I came for many of those reasons that are no\r\nreasons\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x94and yet that are really the best: to come away,\r\nto change, to break with everything. When once one comes away one must\r\narrive somewhere, and I asked myself why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t arrive here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly had time on the way!\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, laughing.\r\n\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster looked at him again; and then, smiling: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have\r\ncertainly had time, since I got here, to ask myself why I came.\r\nHowever, I never ask myself idle questions. Here I am, and it seems to\r\nme you ought only to thank me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you go away you will see the difficulties I shall put in your\r\npath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to put difficulties in my path?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, rearranging the\r\nrosebud in her corsage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest of all\xe2\x80\x94that of having been so agreeable\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I shall be unable to depart? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure. I have left some\r\nvery agreeable people over there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was to come here, where I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know of your existence. Excuse me for saying anything so\r\nrude; but, honestly speaking, I did not. No,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwas precisely not to see you\xe2\x80\x94such people as you\xe2\x80\x94that I came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch people as me?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Acton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a sort of longing to come into those natural relations which I\r\nknew I should find here. Over there I had only, as I may say,\r\nartificial relations. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see the difference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difference tells against me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I am an\r\nartificial relation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConventional,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the Baroness; \xe2\x80\x9cvery conventional.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there is one way in which the relation of a lady and a gentleman\r\nmay always become natural,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean by their becoming lovers? That may be natural or not. And at\r\nany rate,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Eugenia, _\xe2\x80\x9cnous n\xe2\x80\x99en sommes pas l\xc3\xa0!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThey were not, as yet; but a little later, when she began to go with\r\nhim to drive, it might almost have seemed that they were. He came for\r\nher several times, alone, in his high \xe2\x80\x9cwagon,\xe2\x80\x9d drawn by a pair of\r\ncharming light-limbed horses. It was different, her having gone with\r\nClifford Wentworth, who was her cousin, and so much younger. It was not\r\nto be imagined that she should have a flirtation with Clifford, who was\r\na mere shame-faced boy, and whom a large section of Boston society\r\nsupposed to be \xe2\x80\x9cengaged\xe2\x80\x9d to Lizzie Acton. Not, indeed, that it was to\r\nbe conceived that the Baroness was a possible party to any flirtation\r\nwhatever; for she was undoubtedly a married lady. It was generally\r\nknown that her matrimonial condition was of the \xe2\x80\x9cmorganatic\xe2\x80\x9d order; but\r\nin its natural aversion to suppose that this meant anything less than\r\nabsolute wedlock, the conscience of the community took refuge in the\r\nbelief that it implied something even more.\r\n\r\nActon wished her to think highly of American scenery, and he drove her\r\nto great distances, picking out the prettiest roads and the largest\r\npoints of view. If we are good when we are contented, Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s virtues\r\nshould now certainly have been uppermost; for she found a charm in the\r\nrapid movement through a wild country, and in a companion who from time\r\nto time made the vehicle dip, with a motion like a swallow\xe2\x80\x99s flight,\r\nover roads of primitive construction, and who, as she felt, would do a\r\ngreat many things that she might ask him. Sometimes, for a couple of\r\nhours together, there were almost no houses; there were nothing but\r\nwoods and rivers and lakes and horizons adorned with bright-looking\r\nmountains. It seemed to the Baroness very wild, as I have said, and\r\nlovely; but the impression added something to that sense of the\r\nenlargement of opportunity which had been born of her arrival in the\r\nNew World.\r\n\r\nOne day\xe2\x80\x94it was late in the afternoon\xe2\x80\x94Acton pulled up his horses on the\r\ncrest of a hill which commanded a beautiful prospect. He let them stand\r\na long time to rest, while he sat there and talked with Madame M\xc3\xbcnster.\r\nThe prospect was beautiful in spite of there being nothing human within\r\nsight. There was a wilderness of woods, and the gleam of a distant\r\nriver, and a glimpse of half the hill-tops in Massachusetts. The road\r\nhad a wide, grassy margin, on the further side of which there flowed a\r\ndeep, clear brook; there were wild flowers in the grass, and beside the\r\nbrook lay the trunk of a fallen tree. Acton waited a while; at last a\r\nrustic wayfarer came trudging along the road. Acton asked him to hold\r\nthe horses\xe2\x80\x94a service he consented to render, as a friendly turn to a\r\nfellow-citizen. Then he invited the Baroness to descend, and the two\r\nwandered away, across the grass, and sat down on the log beside the\r\nbrook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI imagine it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remind you of Silberstadt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton. It was\r\nthe first time that he had mentioned Silberstadt to her, for particular\r\nreasons. He knew she had a husband there, and this was disagreeable to\r\nhim; and, furthermore, it had been repeated to him that this husband\r\nwished to put her away\xe2\x80\x94a state of affairs to which even indirect\r\nreference was to be deprecated. It was true, nevertheless, that the\r\nBaroness herself had often alluded to Silberstadt; and Acton had often\r\nwondered why her husband wished to get rid of her. It was a curious\r\nposition for a lady\xe2\x80\x94this being known as a repudiated wife; and it is\r\nworthy of observation that the Baroness carried it off with exceeding\r\ngrace and dignity. She had made it felt, from the first, that there\r\nwere two sides to the question, and that her own side, when she should\r\nchoose to present it, would be replete with touching interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not remind me of the town, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cof the\r\nsculptured gables and the Gothic churches, of the wonderful Schloss,\r\nwith its moat and its clustering towers. But it has a little look of\r\nsome other parts of the principality. One might fancy one\xe2\x80\x99s self among\r\nthose grand old German forests, those legendary mountains; the sort of\r\ncountry one sees from the windows at Schreckenstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Schreckenstein?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Acton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great castle,\xe2\x80\x94the summer residence of the Reigning Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever lived there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have stayed there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. Acton was silent; he looked a\r\nwhile at the uncastled landscape before him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the first time you\r\nhave ever asked me about Silberstadt,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI should think you\r\nwould want to know about my marriage; it must seem to you very\r\nstrange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon looked at her a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like me to say that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou Americans have such odd ways!\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness declared. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never\r\nask anything outright; there seem to be so many things you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe Americans are very polite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, whose national\r\nconsciousness had been complicated by a residence in foreign lands, and\r\nwho yet disliked to hear Americans abused. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t like to tread upon\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s toes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I should like very much to hear about\r\nyour marriage. Now tell me how it came about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prince fell in love with me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Baroness simply. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\npressed his suit very hard. At first he didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish me to marry him; on\r\nthe contrary. But on that basis I refused to listen to him. So he\r\noffered me marriage\xe2\x80\x94in so far as he might. I was young, and I confess I\r\nwas rather flattered. But if it were to be done again now, I certainly\r\nshould not accept him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long ago was this?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Acton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94several years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should never ask a woman for\r\ndates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I should think that when a woman was relating history \xe2\x80\x9c Acton\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now he wants to break it off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want him to make a political marriage. It is his brother\xe2\x80\x99s idea.\r\nHis brother is very clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must be a precious pair!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Robert Acton.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness gave a little philosophic shrug. \xe2\x80\x9c_Que voulez-vous?_ They\r\nare princes. They think they are treating me very well. Silberstadt is\r\na perfectly despotic little state, and the Reigning Prince may annul\r\nthe marriage by a stroke of his pen. But he has promised me,\r\nnevertheless, not to do so without my formal consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this you have refused?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHitherto. It is an indignity, and I have wished at least to make it\r\ndifficult for them. But I have a little document in my writing-desk\r\nwhich I have only to sign and send back to the Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it will be all over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness lifted her hand, and dropped it again. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I shall\r\nkeep my title; at least, I shall be at liberty to keep it if I choose.\r\nAnd I suppose I shall keep it. One must have a name. And I shall keep\r\nmy pension. It is very small\xe2\x80\x94it is wretchedly small; but it is what I\r\nlive on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have only to sign that paper?\xe2\x80\x9d Acton asked.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness looked at him a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you urge it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up slowly, and stood with his hands in his pockets. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\ngain by not doing it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am supposed to gain this advantage\xe2\x80\x94that if I delay, or temporize,\r\nthe Prince may come back to me, may make a stand against his brother.\r\nHe is very fond of me, and his brother has pushed him only little by\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he were to come back to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, \xe2\x80\x9cwould you\xe2\x80\x94would you take\r\nhim back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness met his eyes; she colored just a little. Then she rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould have the satisfaction of saying, \xe2\x80\x98Now it is my turn. I break\r\nwith your Serene Highness!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey began to walk toward the carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robert Acton,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a curious story! How did you make his acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was staying with an old lady\xe2\x80\x94an old Countess\xe2\x80\x94in Dresden. She had\r\nbeen a friend of my father\xe2\x80\x99s. My father was dead; I was very much\r\nalone. My brother was wandering about the world in a theatrical\r\ntroupe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother ought to have stayed with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton observed, \xe2\x80\x9cand kept\r\nyou from putting your trust in princes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness was silent a moment, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cHe did what he could,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cHe sent me money. The old Countess encouraged the Prince; she\r\nwas even pressing. It seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame M\xc3\xbcnster added, gently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x94under the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94I behaved very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon glanced at her, and made the observation\xe2\x80\x94he had made it\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94that a woman looks the prettier for having unfolded her wrongs\r\nor her sufferings. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, audibly, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see\r\nyou send his Serene Highness\xe2\x80\x94somewhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster stooped and plucked a daisy from the grass. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd not\r\nsign my renunciation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn one case I should have my revenge; in another case I should have my\r\nliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon gave a little laugh as he helped her into the carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any\r\nrate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctake good care of that paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA couple of days afterward he asked her to come and see his house. The\r\nvisit had already been proposed, but it had been put off in consequence\r\nof his mother\xe2\x80\x99s illness. She was a constant invalid, and she had passed\r\nthese recent years, very patiently, in a great flowered arm-chair at\r\nher bedroom window. Lately, for some days, she had been unable to see\r\nanyone; but now she was better, and she sent the Baroness a very civil\r\nmessage. Acton had wished their visitor to come to dinner; but Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster preferred to begin with a simple call. She had reflected that\r\nif she should go to dinner Mr. Wentworth and his daughters would also\r\nbe asked, and it had seemed to her that the peculiar character of the\r\noccasion would be best preserved in a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with her host. Why\r\nthe occasion should have a peculiar character she explained to no one.\r\nAs far as anyone could see, it was simply very pleasant. Acton came for\r\nher and drove her to his door, an operation which was rapidly\r\nperformed. His house the Baroness mentally pronounced a very good one;\r\nmore articulately, she declared that it was enchanting. It was large\r\nand square and painted brown; it stood in a well-kept shrubbery, and\r\nwas approached, from the gate, by a short drive. It was, moreover, a\r\nmuch more modern dwelling than Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s, and was more\r\nredundantly upholstered and expensively ornamented. The Baroness\r\nperceived that her entertainer had analyzed material comfort to a\r\nsufficiently fine point. And then he possessed the most delightful\r\n_chinoiseries_\xe2\x80\x94trophies of his sojourn in the Celestial Empire: pagodas\r\nof ebony and cabinets of ivory; sculptured monsters, grinning and\r\nleering on chimney-pieces, in front of beautifully figured\r\nhand-screens; porcelain dinner-sets, gleaming behind the glass doors of\r\nmahogany buffets; large screens, in corners, covered with tense silk\r\nand embroidered with mandarins and dragons. These things were scattered\r\nall over the house, and they gave Eugenia a pretext for a complete\r\ndomiciliary visit. She liked it, she enjoyed it; she thought it a very\r\nnice place. It had a mixture of the homely and the liberal, and though\r\nit was almost a museum, the large, little-used rooms were as fresh and\r\nclean as a well-kept dairy. Lizzie Acton told her that she dusted all\r\nthe pagodas and other curiosities every day with her own hands; and the\r\nBaroness answered that she was evidently a household fairy. Lizzie had\r\nnot at all the look of a young lady who dusted things; she wore such\r\npretty dresses and had such delicate fingers that it was difficult to\r\nimagine her immersed in sordid cares. She came to meet Madame M\xc3\xbcnster\r\non her arrival, but she said nothing, or almost nothing, and the\r\nBaroness again reflected\xe2\x80\x94she had had occasion to do so before\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nAmerican girls had no manners. She disliked this little American girl,\r\nand she was quite prepared to learn that she had failed to commend\r\nherself to Miss Acton. Lizzie struck her as positive and explicit\r\nalmost to pertness; and the idea of her combining the apparent\r\nincongruities of a taste for housework and the wearing of fresh,\r\nParisian-looking dresses suggested the possession of a dangerous\r\nenergy. It was a source of irritation to the Baroness that in this\r\ncountry it should seem to matter whether a little girl were a trifle\r\nless or a trifle more of a nonentity; for Eugenia had hitherto been\r\nconscious of no moral pressure as regards the appreciation of\r\ndiminutive virgins. It was perhaps an indication of Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s pertness\r\nthat she very soon retired and left the Baroness on her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. Acton talked a great deal about his _chinoiseries_; he knew a\r\ngood deal about porcelain and bric-\xc3\xa0-brac. The Baroness, in her\r\nprogress through the house, made, as it were, a great many stations.\r\nShe sat down everywhere, confessed to being a little tired, and asked\r\nabout the various objects with a curious mixture of alertness and\r\ninattention. If there had been anyone to say it to she would have\r\ndeclared that she was positively in love with her host; but she could\r\nhardly make this declaration\xe2\x80\x94even in the strictest confidence\xe2\x80\x94to Acton\r\nhimself. It gave her, nevertheless, a pleasure that had some of the\r\ncharm of unwontedness to feel, with that admirable keenness with which\r\nshe was capable of feeling things, that he had a disposition without\r\nany edges; that even his humorous irony always expanded toward the\r\npoint. One\xe2\x80\x99s impression of his honesty was almost like carrying a bunch\r\nof flowers; the perfume was most agreeable, but they were occasionally\r\nan inconvenience. One could trust him, at any rate, round all the\r\ncorners of the world; and, withal, he was not absolutely simple, which\r\nwould have been excess; he was only relatively simple, which was quite\r\nenough for the Baroness.\r\n\r\nLizzie reappeared to say that her mother would now be happy to receive\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster; and the Baroness followed her to Mrs. Acton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napartment. Eugenia reflected, as she went, that it was not the\r\naffectation of impertinence that made her dislike this young lady, for\r\non that ground she could easily have beaten her. It was not an\r\naspiration on the girl\xe2\x80\x99s part to rivalry, but a kind of laughing,\r\nchildishly-mocking indifference to the results of comparison. Mrs.\r\nActon was an emaciated, sweet-faced woman of five and fifty, sitting\r\nwith pillows behind her, and looking out on a clump of hemlocks. She\r\nwas very modest, very timid, and very ill; she made Eugenia feel\r\ngrateful that she herself was not like that\xe2\x80\x94neither so ill, nor,\r\npossibly, so modest. On a chair, beside her, lay a volume of Emerson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nEssays. It was a great occasion for poor Mrs. Acton, in her helpless\r\ncondition, to be confronted with a clever foreign lady, who had more\r\nmanner than any lady\xe2\x80\x94any dozen ladies\xe2\x80\x94that she had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard a great deal about you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly, to the\r\nBaroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom your son, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d Eugenia asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has talked to me immensely of\r\nyou. Oh, he talks of you as you would like,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness declared; \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nsuch a son _must_ talk of such a mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Acton sat gazing; this was part of Madame M\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmanner.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nRobert Acton was gazing too, in vivid consciousness that he had barely\r\nmentioned his mother to their brilliant guest. He never talked of this\r\nstill maternal presence,\xe2\x80\x94a presence refined to such delicacy that it\r\nhad almost resolved itself, with him, simply into the subjective\r\nemotion of gratitude. And Acton rarely talked of his emotions. The\r\nBaroness turned her smile toward him, and she instantly felt that she\r\nhad been observed to be fibbing. She had struck a false note. But who\r\nwere these people to whom such fibbing was not pleasing? If they were\r\nannoyed, the Baroness was equally so; and after the exchange of a few\r\ncivil inquiries and low-voiced responses she took leave of Mrs. Acton.\r\nShe begged Robert not to come home with her; she would get into the\r\ncarriage alone; she preferred that. This was imperious, and she thought\r\nhe looked disappointed. While she stood before the door with him\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncarriage was turning in the gravel-walk\xe2\x80\x94this thought restored her\r\nserenity.\r\n\r\nWhen she had given him her hand in farewell she looked at him a moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have almost decided to dispatch that paper,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe knew that she alluded to the document that she had called her\r\nrenunciation; and he assisted her into the carriage without saying\r\nanything. But just before the vehicle began to move he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nwhen you have in fact dispatched it, I hope you will let me know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix Young finished Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s portrait, and he afterwards transferred\r\nto canvas the features of many members of that circle of which it may\r\nbe said that he had become for the time the pivot and the centre. I am\r\nafraid it must be confessed that he was a decidedly flattering painter,\r\nand that he imparted to his models a romantic grace which seemed easily\r\nand cheaply acquired by the payment of a hundred dollars to a young man\r\nwho made \xe2\x80\x9csitting\xe2\x80\x9d so entertaining. For Felix was paid for his\r\npictures, making, as he did, no secret of the fact that in guiding his\r\nsteps to the Western world affectionate curiosity had gone hand in hand\r\nwith a desire to better his condition. He took his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s portrait\r\nquite as if Mr. Wentworth had never averted himself from the\r\nexperiment; and as he compassed his end only by the exercise of gentle\r\nviolence, it is but fair to add that he allowed the old man to give him\r\nnothing but his time. He passed his arm into Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s one summer\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94very few arms indeed had ever passed into Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nled him across the garden and along the road into the studio which he\r\nhad extemporized in the little house among the apple trees. The grave\r\ngentleman felt himself more and more fascinated by his clever nephew,\r\nwhose fresh, demonstrative youth seemed a compendium of experiences so\r\nstrangely numerous. It appeared to him that Felix must know a great\r\ndeal; he would like to learn what he thought about some of those things\r\nas regards which his own conversation had always been formal, but his\r\nknowledge vague. Felix had a confident, gayly trenchant way of judging\r\nhuman actions which Mr. Wentworth grew little by little to envy; it\r\nseemed like criticism made easy. Forming an opinion\xe2\x80\x94say on a person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct\xe2\x80\x94was, with Mr. Wentworth, a good deal like fumbling in a lock\r\nwith a key chosen at hazard. He seemed to himself to go about the world\r\nwith a big bunch of these ineffectual instruments at his girdle. His\r\nnephew, on the other hand, with a single turn of the wrist, opened any\r\ndoor as adroitly as a horse-thief. He felt obliged to keep up the\r\nconvention that an uncle is always wiser than a nephew, even if he\r\ncould keep it up no otherwise than by listening in serious silence to\r\nFelix\xe2\x80\x99s quick, light, constant discourse. But there came a day when he\r\nlapsed from consistency and almost asked his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s advice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever entertained the idea of settling in the United States?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked one morning, while Felix brilliantly plied his brush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cexcuse me if your question makes me smile\r\na little. To begin with, I have never entertained an idea. Ideas often\r\nentertain _me_; but I am afraid I have never seriously made a plan. I\r\nknow what you are going to say; or rather, I know what you think, for I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think you will say it\xe2\x80\x94that this is very frivolous and\r\nloose-minded on my part. So it is; but I am made like that; I take\r\nthings as they come, and somehow there is always some new thing to\r\nfollow the last. In the second place, I should never propose to\r\n_settle_. I can\xe2\x80\x99t settle, my dear uncle; I\xe2\x80\x99m not a settler. I know that\r\nis what strangers are supposed to do here; they always settle. But I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94to answer your question\xe2\x80\x94entertained that idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou intend to return to Europe and resume your irregular manner of\r\nlife?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I intend. But it\xe2\x80\x99s very likely I shall go back to Europe.\r\nAfter all, I am a European. I feel that, you know. It will depend a\r\ngood deal upon my sister. She\xe2\x80\x99s even more of a European than I; here,\r\nyou know, she\xe2\x80\x99s a picture out of her setting. And as for \xe2\x80\x98resuming,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndear uncle, I really have never given up my irregular manner of life.\r\nWhat, for me, could be more irregular than this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThan what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Wentworth, with his pale gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, than everything! Living in the midst of you, this way; this\r\ncharming, quiet, serious family life; fraternizing with Charlotte and\r\nGertrude; calling upon twenty young ladies and going out to walk with\r\nthem; sitting with you in the evening on the piazza and listening to\r\nthe crickets, and going to bed at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour description is very animated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I see\r\nnothing improper in what you describe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither do I, dear uncle. It is extremely delightful; I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nit if it were improper. I assure you I don\xe2\x80\x99t like improper things;\r\nthough I dare say you think I do,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix went on, painting away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never accused you of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause, you see, at bottom I am a terrible\r\nPhilistine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Philistine?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, as one may say, a plain, God-fearing man.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth\r\nlooked at him reservedly, like a mystified sage, and Felix continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust I shall enjoy a venerable and venerated old age. I mean to\r\nlive long. I can hardly call that a plan, perhaps; but it\xe2\x80\x99s a keen\r\ndesire\xe2\x80\x94a rosy vision. I shall be a lively, perhaps even a frivolous old\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is natural,\xe2\x80\x9d said his uncle, sententiously, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one should desire\r\nto prolong an agreeable life. We have perhaps a selfish indisposition\r\nto bring our pleasure to a close. But I presume,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nexpect to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat too, dear uncle, is a hope, a desire, a vision,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. It\r\noccurred to him for an instant that this was possibly a preface to the\r\noffer of the hand of one of Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s admirable daughters. But in\r\nthe name of decent modesty and a proper sense of the hard realities of\r\nthis world, Felix banished the thought. His uncle was the incarnation\r\nof benevolence, certainly; but from that to accepting\xe2\x80\x94much more\r\npostulating\xe2\x80\x94the idea of a union between a young lady with a dowry\r\npresumptively brilliant and a penniless artist with no prospect of\r\nfame, there was a very long way. Felix had lately become conscious of a\r\nluxurious preference for the society\xe2\x80\x94if possible unshared with\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x94of Gertrude Wentworth; but he had relegated this young lady, for\r\nthe moment, to the coldly brilliant category of unattainable\r\npossessions. She was not the first woman for whom he had entertained an\r\nunpractical admiration. He had been in love with duchesses and\r\ncountesses, and he had made, once or twice, a perilously near approach\r\nto cynicism in declaring that the disinterestedness of women had been\r\noverrated. On the whole, he had tempered audacity with modesty; and it\r\nis but fair to him now to say explicitly that he would have been\r\nincapable of taking advantage of his present large allowance of\r\nfamiliarity to make love to the younger of his handsome cousins. Felix\r\nhad grown up among traditions in the light of which such a proceeding\r\nlooked like a grievous breach of hospitality. I have said that he was\r\nalways happy, and it may be counted among the present sources of his\r\nhappiness that he had as regards this matter of his relations with\r\nGertrude a deliciously good conscience. His own deportment seemed to\r\nhim suffused with the beauty of virtue\xe2\x80\x94a form of beauty that he admired\r\nwith the same vivacity with which he admired all other forms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that if you marry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth presently, \xe2\x80\x9cit will\r\nconduce to your happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cSicurissimo!\xe2\x80\x9d_ Felix exclaimed; and then, arresting his brush, he\r\nlooked at his uncle with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something I feel tempted to\r\nsay to you. May I risk it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth drew himself up a little. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very safe; I don\xe2\x80\x99t repeat\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d But he hoped Felix would not risk too much.\r\n\r\nFelix was laughing at his answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s odd to hear you telling me how to be happy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\r\nknow yourself, dear uncle. Now, does that sound brutal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man was silent a moment, and then, with a dry dignity that\r\nsuddenly touched his nephew: \xe2\x80\x9cWe may sometimes point out a road we are\r\nunable to follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you have had any sorrows,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuppose it, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to allude to them. I simply meant that\r\nyou all don\xe2\x80\x99t amuse yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmuse ourselves? We are not children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely not! You have reached the proper age. I was saying that the\r\nother day to Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix added. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it was not indiscreet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, with a keener irony than Felix would\r\nhave thought him capable of, \xe2\x80\x9cit was but your way of amusing yourself.\r\nI am afraid you have never had a trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I have!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix declared, with some spirit; \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I knew\r\nbetter. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t catch me at it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth maintained for a while a silence more expressive than a\r\ndeep-drawn sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no children,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your charming young people are\r\na source of grief to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, after a pause, Mr. Wentworth\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of Gertrude. But I feel considerable anxiety\r\nabout Clifford. I will tell you another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next time he gave Felix a sitting his nephew reminded him that he\r\nhad taken him into his confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is Clifford today?\xe2\x80\x9d Felix\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has always seemed to me a young man of remarkable\r\ndiscretion. Indeed, he is only too discreet; he seems on his guard\r\nagainst me\xe2\x80\x94as if he thought me rather light company. The other day he\r\ntold his sister\xe2\x80\x94Gertrude repeated it to me\xe2\x80\x94that I was always laughing\r\nat him. If I laugh it is simply from the impulse to try and inspire him\r\nwith confidence. That is the only way I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClifford\xe2\x80\x99s situation is no laughing matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis very peculiar, as I suppose you have guessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you mean his love affair with his cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth stared, blushing a little. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean his absence from\r\ncollege. He has been suspended. We have decided not to speak of it\r\nunless we are asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuspended?\xe2\x80\x9d Felix repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been requested by the Harvard authorities to absent himself for\r\nsix months. Meanwhile he is studying with Mr. Brand. We think Mr. Brand\r\nwill help him; at least we hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat befell him at college?\xe2\x80\x9d Felix asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was too fond of\r\npleasure? Mr. Brand certainly will not teach him any of those secrets!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was too fond of something of which he should not have been fond. I\r\nsuppose it is considered a pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix gave his light laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear uncle, is there any doubt about\r\nits being a pleasure? _C\xe2\x80\x99est de son \xc3\xa2ge_, as they say in France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have said rather it was a vice of later life\xe2\x80\x94of disappointed\r\nold age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix glanced at his uncle, with his lifted eyebrows, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\nwhat are you speaking?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the situation in which Clifford was found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he was found\xe2\x80\x94he was caught?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNecessarily, he was caught. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk; he staggered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9che drinks! I rather suspected that, from something I\r\nobserved the first day I came here. I quite agree with you that it is a\r\nlow taste. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a vice for a gentleman. He ought to give it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope for a good deal from Mr. Brand\xe2\x80\x99s influence,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has talked to him from the first. And he never touches\r\nanything himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will talk to him\xe2\x80\x94I will talk to him!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix declared, gayly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you say to him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his uncle, with some apprehension.\r\n\r\nFelix for some moments answered nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to marry him to\r\nhis cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry him?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mr. Wentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think his cousin would\r\nwant to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no understanding, then, with Mrs. Acton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth stared, almost blankly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never discussed such\r\nsubjects with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it might be time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cLizzie Acton is\r\nadmirably pretty, and if Clifford is dangerous....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no reason to\r\nsuppose they are engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cPar exemple!\xe2\x80\x9d_ cried Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cA clandestine engagement? Trust me,\r\nClifford, as I say, is a charming boy. He is incapable of that. Lizzie\r\nActon, then, would not be jealous of another woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, with a vague sense of\r\njealousy being an even lower vice than a love of liquor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best thing for Clifford, then,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix propounded, \xe2\x80\x9cis to become\r\ninterested in some clever, charming woman.\xe2\x80\x9d And he paused in his\r\npainting, and, with his elbows on his knees, looked with bright\r\ncommunicativeness at his uncle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I believe greatly in the\r\ninfluence of women. Living with women helps to make a man a gentleman.\r\nIt is very true Clifford has his sisters, who are so charming. But\r\nthere should be a different sentiment in play from the fraternal, you\r\nknow. He has Lizzie Acton; but she, perhaps, is rather immature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect Lizzie has talked to him, reasoned with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nWentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the impropriety of getting tipsy\xe2\x80\x94on the beauty of temperance? That\r\nis dreary work for a pretty young girl. No,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix continued; \xe2\x80\x9cClifford\r\nought to frequent some agreeable woman, who, without ever mentioning\r\nsuch unsavory subjects, would give him a sense of its being very\r\nridiculous to be fuddled. If he could fall in love with her a little,\r\nso much the better. The thing would operate as a cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, what lady should you suggest?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a clever woman under your hand. My sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sister\xe2\x80\x94under my hand?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay a word to Clifford. Tell him to be bold. He is well disposed\r\nalready; he has invited her two or three times to drive. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink he comes to see her. Give him a hint to come\xe2\x80\x94to come often. He\r\nwill sit there of an afternoon, and they will talk. It will do him\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth meditated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think she will exercise a helpful\r\ninfluence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will exercise a civilizing\xe2\x80\x94I may call it a sobering\xe2\x80\x94influence. A\r\ncharming, clever, witty woman always does\xe2\x80\x94especially if she is a little\r\nof a coquette. My dear uncle, the society of such women has been half\r\nmy education. If Clifford is suspended, as you say, from college, let\r\nEugenia be his preceptress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth continued thoughtful. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think Eugenia is a coquette?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat pretty woman is not?\xe2\x80\x9d Felix demanded in turn. But this, for Mr.\r\nWentworth, could at the best have been no answer, for he did not think\r\nhis niece pretty. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Clifford,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cEugenia will\r\nsimply be enough of a coquette to be a little ironical. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\r\nneeds. So you recommend him to be nice with her, you know. The\r\nsuggestion will come best from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am to suggest to my son\r\nto make a\xe2\x80\x94a profession of\xe2\x80\x94of affection to Madame M\xc3\xbcnster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94a profession!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, as I understand it, Madame M\xc3\xbcnster is a married woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cof course she can\xe2\x80\x99t marry him. But she will\r\ndo what she can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth sat for some time with his eyes on the floor; at last he\r\ngot up. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can undertake to recommend my\r\nson any such course.\xe2\x80\x9d And without meeting Felix\xe2\x80\x99s surprised glance he\r\nbroke off his sitting, which was not resumed for a fortnight.\r\n\r\nFelix was very fond of the little lake which occupied so many of Mr.\r\nWentworth\xe2\x80\x99s numerous acres, and of a remarkable pine grove which lay\r\nupon the further side of it, planted upon a steep embankment and\r\nhaunted by the summer breeze. The murmur of the air in the far off\r\ntree-tops had a strange distinctness; it was almost articulate. One\r\nafternoon the young man came out of his painting-room and passed the\r\nopen door of Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s little salon. Within, in the cool dimness, he\r\nsaw his sister, dressed in white, buried in her arm-chair, and holding\r\nto her face an immense bouquet. Opposite to her sat Clifford Wentworth,\r\ntwirling his hat. He had evidently just presented the bouquet to the\r\nBaroness, whose fine eyes, as she glanced at him over the big roses and\r\ngeraniums, wore a conversational smile. Felix, standing on the\r\nthreshold of the cottage, hesitated for a moment as to whether he\r\nshould retrace his steps and enter the parlor. Then he went his way and\r\npassed into Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s garden. That civilizing process to which he\r\nhad suggested that Clifford should be subjected appeared to have come\r\non of itself. Felix was very sure, at least, that Mr. Wentworth had not\r\nadopted his ingenious device for stimulating the young man\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic\r\nconsciousness. \xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless he supposes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, after the\r\nconversation that has been narrated, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I desire, out of fraternal\r\nbenevolence, to procure for Eugenia the amusement of a flirtation\xe2\x80\x94or,\r\nas he probably calls it, an intrigue\xe2\x80\x94with the too susceptible Clifford.\r\nIt must be admitted\xe2\x80\x94and I have noticed it before\xe2\x80\x94that nothing exceeds\r\nthe license occasionally taken by the imagination of very rigid\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d Felix, on his own side, had of course said nothing to\r\nClifford; but he had observed to Eugenia that Mr. Wentworth was much\r\nmortified at his son\xe2\x80\x99s low tastes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to do something to help\r\nthem, after all their kindness to us,\xe2\x80\x9d he had added. \xe2\x80\x9cEncourage\r\nClifford to come and see you, and inspire him with a taste for\r\nconversation. That will supplant the other, which only comes from his\r\npuerility, from his not taking his position in the world\xe2\x80\x94that of a rich\r\nyoung man of ancient stock\xe2\x80\x94seriously enough. Make him a little more\r\nserious. Even if he makes love to you it is no great matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to offer myself as a superior form of intoxication\xe2\x80\x94a substitute\r\nfor a brandy bottle, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cTruly, in this country\r\none comes to strange uses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had not positively declined to undertake Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s higher\r\neducation, and Felix, who had not thought of the matter again, being\r\nhaunted with visions of more personal profit, now reflected that the\r\nwork of redemption had fairly begun. The idea in prospect had seemed of\r\nthe happiest, but in operation it made him a trifle uneasy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if\r\nEugenia\xe2\x80\x94what if Eugenia\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he asked himself softly; the question dying\r\naway in his sense of Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s undetermined capacity. But before Felix\r\nhad time either to accept or to reject its admonition, even in this\r\nvague form, he saw Robert Acton turn out of Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s enclosure,\r\nby a distant gate, and come toward the cottage in the orchard. Acton\r\nhad evidently walked from his own house along a shady by-way and was\r\nintending to pay a visit to Madame M\xc3\xbcnster. Felix watched him a moment;\r\nthen he turned away. Acton could be left to play the part of Providence\r\nand interrupt\xe2\x80\x94if interruption were needed\xe2\x80\x94Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s entanglement with\r\nEugenia.\r\n\r\nFelix passed through the garden toward the house and toward a postern\r\ngate which opened upon a path leading across the fields, beside a\r\nlittle wood, to the lake. He stopped and looked up at the house; his\r\neyes rested more particularly upon a certain open window, on the shady\r\nside. Presently Gertrude appeared there, looking out into the summer\r\nlight. He took off his hat to her and bade her good-day; he remarked\r\nthat he was going to row across the pond, and begged that she would do\r\nhim the honor to accompany him. She looked at him a moment; then,\r\nwithout saying anything, she turned away. But she soon reappeared below\r\nin one of those quaint and charming Leghorn hats, tied with white satin\r\nbows, that were worn at that period; she also carried a green parasol.\r\nShe went with him to the edge of the lake, where a couple of boats were\r\nalways moored; they got into one of them, and Felix, with gentle\r\nstrokes, propelled it to the opposite shore. The day was the perfection\r\nof summer weather; the little lake was the color of sunshine; the plash\r\nof the oars was the only sound, and they found themselves listening to\r\nit. They disembarked, and, by a winding path, ascended the pine-crested\r\nmound which overlooked the water, whose white expanse glittered between\r\nthe trees. The place was delightfully cool, and had the added charm\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94in the softly sounding pine boughs\xe2\x80\x94you seemed to hear the coolness\r\nas well as feel it. Felix and Gertrude sat down on the rust-colored\r\ncarpet of pine-needles and talked of many things. Felix spoke at last,\r\nin the course of talk, of his going away; it was the first time he had\r\nalluded to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going away?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome day\xe2\x80\x94when the leaves begin to fall. You know I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay\r\nforever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude transferred her eyes to the outer prospect, and then, after a\r\npause, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall probably both survive my departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Gertrude only repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never see you again. I shall never\r\nhear of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall know nothing about you. I knew\r\nnothing about you before, and it will be the same again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew nothing about you then, unfortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cBut now I\r\nshall write to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t write to me. I shall not answer you,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should of course burn your letters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at him again. \xe2\x80\x9cBurn my letters? You sometimes say\r\nstrange things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not strange in themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are\r\nonly strange as said to you. You will come to Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith whom shall I come?\xe2\x80\x9d She asked this question simply; she was very\r\nmuch in earnest. Felix was interested in her earnestness; for some\r\nmoments he hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that,\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay that I shall go with my father and my sister; you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall keep your letters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, presently, for all answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never write. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to write.\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude, for some time,\r\nsaid nothing more; and her companion, as he looked at her, wished it\r\nhad not been \xe2\x80\x9cdisloyal\xe2\x80\x9d to make love to the daughter of an old\r\ngentleman who had offered one hospitality. The afternoon waned; the\r\nshadows stretched themselves; and the light grew deeper in the western\r\nsky. Two persons appeared on the opposite side of the lake, coming from\r\nthe house and crossing the meadow. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Charlotte and Mr. Brand,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming over here.\xe2\x80\x9d But Charlotte and Mr. Brand\r\nonly came down to the edge of the water, and stood there, looking\r\nacross; they made no motion to enter the boat that Felix had left at\r\nthe mooring-place. Felix waved his hat to them; it was too far to call.\r\nThey made no visible response, and they presently turned away and\r\nwalked along the shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brand is not demonstrative,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is never\r\ndemonstrative to me. He sits silent, with his chin in his hand, looking\r\nat me. Sometimes he looks away. Your father tells me he is so eloquent;\r\nand I should like to hear him talk. He looks like such a noble young\r\nman. But with me he will never talk. And yet I am so fond of listening\r\nto brilliant imagery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very eloquent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he has no brilliant imagery.\r\nI have heard him talk a great deal. I knew that when they saw us they\r\nwould not come over here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he is making _la cour_, as they say, to your sister? They desire\r\nto be alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthey have no such reason as that for\r\nbeing alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he make _la cour_ to Charlotte?\xe2\x80\x9d Felix inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nis so pretty, so gentle, so good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude glanced at him, and then she looked at the distantly-seen\r\ncouple they were discussing. Mr. Brand and Charlotte were walking side\r\nby side. They might have been a pair of lovers, and yet they might not.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey think I should not be here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith me? I thought you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have those ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. There are a great many things you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand my stupidity. But why, then, do not Charlotte and Mr.\r\nBrand, who, as an elder sister and a clergyman, are free to walk about\r\ntogether, come over and make me wiser by breaking up the unlawful\r\ninterview into which I have lured you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the last thing they would do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\nFelix stared at her a moment, with his lifted eyebrows. _\xe2\x80\x9cJe n\xe2\x80\x99y\r\ncomprends rien!\xe2\x80\x9d_ he exclaimed; then his eyes followed for a while the\r\nretreating figures of this critical pair. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may say what you\r\nplease,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared; \xe2\x80\x9cit is evident to me that your sister is not\r\nindifferent to her clever companion. It is agreeable to her to be\r\nwalking there with him. I can see that from here.\xe2\x80\x9d And in the\r\nexcitement of observation Felix rose to his feet.\r\n\r\nGertrude rose also, but she made no attempt to emulate her companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscovery; she looked rather in another direction. Felix\xe2\x80\x99s words had\r\nstruck her; but a certain delicacy checked her. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is certainly not\r\nindifferent to Mr. Brand; she has the highest opinion of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can see it\xe2\x80\x94one can see it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, in a tone of amused\r\ncontemplation, with his head on one side. Gertrude turned her back to\r\nthe opposite shore; it was disagreeable to her to look, but she hoped\r\nFelix would say something more. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, they have wandered away into the\r\nwood,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nGertrude turned round again. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is _not_ in love with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said;\r\nit seemed her duty to say that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he is in love with her; or if he is not, he ought to be. She is\r\nsuch a perfect little woman of her kind. She reminds me of a pair of\r\nold-fashioned silver sugar-tongs; you know I am very fond of sugar. And\r\nshe is very nice with Mr. Brand; I have noticed that; very gentle and\r\ngracious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude reflected a moment. Then she took a great resolution. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nwants him to marry me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo of course she is nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows rose higher than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cTo marry you! Ah, ah, this is\r\ninteresting. And you think one must be very nice with a man to induce\r\nhim to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude had turned a little pale, but she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brand wants it\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix folded his arms and stood looking at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x94I see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nquickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you never tell me this before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is disagreeable to me to speak of it even now. I wished simply to\r\nexplain to you about Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to marry Mr. Brand, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does your father wish it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t like him\xe2\x80\x94you have refused him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father and sister think you ought to, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cThey think there are good\r\nreasons. I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it. They think I have obligations, and that I\r\nhave encouraged him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix smiled at her, as if she had been telling him an amusing story\r\nabout someone else. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how this interests me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize these reasons\xe2\x80\x94these obligations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure; it is not easy.\xe2\x80\x9d And she picked up her parasol and\r\nturned away, as if to descend the slope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me this,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix went on, going with her: \xe2\x80\x9care you likely to give\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94to let them persuade you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at him with the serious face that she had constantly\r\nworn, in opposition to his almost eager smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never marry Mr.\r\nBrand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix rejoined. And they slowly descended the hill together,\r\nsaying nothing till they reached the margin of the pond. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is your\r\nown affair,\xe2\x80\x9d he then resumed; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do you know, I am not altogether\r\nglad? If it were settled that you were to marry Mr. Brand I should take\r\na certain comfort in the arrangement. I should feel more free. I have\r\nno right to make love to you myself, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d And he paused, lightly\r\npressing his argument upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gertrude quickly\xe2\x80\x94too quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father would never hear of it; I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a penny. Mr. Brand, of\r\ncourse, has property of his own, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe he has some property; but that has nothing to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith you, of course not; but with your father and sister it must have.\r\nSo, as I say, if this were settled, I should feel more at liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore at liberty?\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease unfasten the boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix untwisted the rope and stood holding it. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be able to say\r\nthings to you that I can\xe2\x80\x99t give myself the pleasure of saying now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cI could tell you how much I admire you, without seeming to\r\npretend to that which I have no right to pretend to. I should make\r\nviolent love to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cif I thought you were so\r\nplaced as not to be offended by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean if I were engaged to another man? That is strange reasoning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGertrude exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case you would not take me seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take everyone seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. And without his help she\r\nstepped lightly into the boat.\r\n\r\nFelix took up the oars and sent it forward. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, this is what you have\r\nbeen thinking about? It seemed to me you had something on your mind. I\r\nwish very much,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would tell me some of these\r\nso-called reasons\xe2\x80\x94these obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not real reasons\xe2\x80\x94good reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, looking at the\r\npink and yellow gleams in the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can understand that! Because a handsome girl has had a spark of\r\ncoquetry, that is no reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean me, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that. I have not done that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is something that troubles you, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much as it used to,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude rejoined.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, smiling always. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not saying much, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nshe only rested her eyes, very gravely, on the lighted water. She\r\nseemed to him to be trying to hide the signs of the trouble of which\r\nshe had just told him. Felix felt, at all times, much the same impulse\r\nto dissipate visible melancholy that a good housewife feels to brush\r\naway dust. There was something he wished to brush away now; suddenly he\r\nstopped rowing and poised his oars. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should Mr. Brand have\r\naddressed himself to you, and not to your sister?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure\r\nshe would listen to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude, in her family, was thought capable of a good deal of levity;\r\nbut her levity had never gone so far as this. It moved her greatly,\r\nhowever, to hear Felix say that he was sure of something; so that,\r\nraising her eyes toward him, she tried intently, for some moments, to\r\nconjure up this wonderful image of a love-affair between her own sister\r\nand her own suitor. We know that Gertrude had an imaginative mind; so\r\nthat it is not impossible that this effort should have been partially\r\nsuccessful. But she only murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Felix! ah, Felix!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they marry? Try and make them marry!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and make them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn the tables on them. Then they will leave you alone. I will help\r\nyou as far as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to beat; she was greatly excited; she had never\r\nhad anything so interesting proposed to her before. Felix had begun to\r\nrow again, and he now sent the boat home with long strokes. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe\r\nshe _does_ care for him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, after they had disembarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she does, and we will marry them off. It will make them\r\nhappy; it will make everyone happy. We shall have a wedding and I will\r\nwrite an epithalamium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems as if it would make _me_ happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get rid of Mr. Brand, eh? To recover your liberty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude walked on. \xe2\x80\x9cTo see my sister married to so good a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix gave his light laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always put things on those grounds;\r\nyou will never say anything for yourself. You are all so afraid, here,\r\nof being selfish. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you know how,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me show\r\nyou! It will make me happy for myself, and for just the reverse of what\r\nI told you a while ago. After that, when I make love to you, you will\r\nhave to think I mean it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never think you mean anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are too\r\nfantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a license to say everything! Gertrude, I\r\nadore you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCharlotte and Mr. Brand had not returned when they reached the house;\r\nbut the Baroness had come to tea, and Robert Acton also, who now\r\nregularly asked for a place at this generous repast or made his\r\nappearance later in the evening. Clifford Wentworth, with his juvenile\r\ngrowl, remarked upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are always coming to tea nowadays, Robert,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nthink you had drunk enough tea in China.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince when is Mr. Acton more frequent?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you came,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems as if you were a kind of\r\nattraction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I am a curiosity,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me time and I\r\nwill make you a salon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would fall to pieces after you go!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Acton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk about her going, in that familiar way,\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmakes me feel gloomy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth glanced at his son, and taking note of these words,\r\nwondered if Felix had been teaching him, according to the programme he\r\nhad sketched out, to make love to the wife of a German prince.\r\n\r\nCharlotte came in late with Mr. Brand; but Gertrude, to whom, at least,\r\nFelix had taught something, looked in vain, in her face, for the traces\r\nof a guilty passion. Mr. Brand sat down by Gertrude, and she presently\r\nasked him why they had not crossed the pond to join Felix and herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is cruel of you to ask me that,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, very softly. He had a\r\nlarge morsel of cake before him; but he fingered it without eating it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think you are growing cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nGertrude said nothing; she was afraid to speak. There was a kind of\r\nrage in her heart; she felt as if she could easily persuade herself\r\nthat she was persecuted. She said to herself that it was quite right\r\nthat she should not allow him to make her believe she was wrong. She\r\nthought of what Felix had said to her; she wished indeed Mr. Brand\r\nwould marry Charlotte. She looked away from him and spoke no more. Mr.\r\nBrand ended by eating his cake, while Felix sat opposite, describing to\r\nMr. Wentworth the students\xe2\x80\x99 duels at Heidelberg. After tea they all\r\ndispersed themselves, as usual, upon the piazza and in the garden; and\r\nMr. Brand drew near to Gertrude again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to you this afternoon because you were not alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nbegan; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you were with a newer friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelix? He is an old friend by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand looked at the ground for some moments. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was\r\nprepared to hear you speak in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I find it\r\nvery painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what else I can say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand walked beside her for a while in silence; Gertrude wished he\r\nwould go away. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is certainly very accomplished. But I think I ought\r\nto advise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo advise me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know your nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, with a soft laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make yourself out worse than you are\xe2\x80\x94to please him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand\r\nsaid, gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse\xe2\x80\x94to please him? What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gertrude, stopping.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand stopped also, and with the same soft straight-forwardness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the things you care for\xe2\x80\x94the great questions of\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude, with her eyes on his, shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for the\r\ngreat questions of life. They are much beyond me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a time when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Gertrude, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you made me talk a great deal of\r\nnonsense. And it depends,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cupon what you call the great\r\nquestions of life. There are some things I care for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they the things you talk about with your cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not say things to me against my cousin, Mr. Brand,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is dishonorable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe listened to this respectfully; then he answered, with a little\r\nvibration of the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be very sorry to do anything\r\ndishonorable. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why it is dishonorable to say that your\r\ncousin is frivolous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and say it to himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he would admit it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the tone he would\r\ntake. He would not be ashamed of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am not ashamed of it!\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude declared. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is probably\r\nwhat I like him for. I am frivolous myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are trying, as I said just now, to lower yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am trying for once to be natural!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gertrude passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave been pretending, all my life; I have been dishonest; it is you\r\nthat have made me so!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand stood gazing at her, and she went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I be frivolous, if I want? One has a right to be\r\nfrivolous, if it\xe2\x80\x99s one\xe2\x80\x99s nature. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for the great\r\nquestions. I care for pleasure\xe2\x80\x94for amusement. Perhaps I am fond of\r\nwicked things; it is very possible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand remained staring; he was even a little pale, as if he had\r\nbeen frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you know what you are saying!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. Perhaps I am talking nonsense. But it is only with you\r\nthat I talk nonsense. I never do so with my cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will speak to you again, when you are less excited,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am always excited when you speak to me. I must tell you that\xe2\x80\x94even if\r\nit prevents you altogether, in future. Your speaking to me irritates\r\nme. With my cousin it is very different. That seems quiet and natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, and then he looked away, with a kind of helpless\r\ndistress, at the dusky garden and the faint summer stars. After which,\r\nsuddenly turning back, \xe2\x80\x9cGertrude, Gertrude!\xe2\x80\x9d he softly groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I\r\nreally losing you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was touched\xe2\x80\x94she was pained; but it had already occurred to her that\r\nshe might do something better than say so. It would not have alleviated\r\nher companion\xe2\x80\x99s distress to perceive, just then, whence she had\r\nsympathetically borrowed this ingenuity. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sorry for you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGertrude said; \xe2\x80\x9cfor in paying so much attention to me you are following\r\na shadow\xe2\x80\x94you are wasting something precious. There is something else\r\nyou might have that you don\xe2\x80\x99t look at\xe2\x80\x94something better than I am. That\r\nis a reality!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, with intention, she looked at him and tried to\r\nsmile a little. He thought this smile of hers very strange; but she\r\nturned away and left him.\r\n\r\nShe wandered about alone in the garden wondering what Mr. Brand would\r\nmake of her words, which it had been a singular pleasure for her to\r\nutter. Shortly after, passing in front of the house, she saw at a\r\ndistance two persons standing near the garden gate. It was Mr. Brand\r\ngoing away and bidding good-night to Charlotte, who had walked down\r\nwith him from the house. Gertrude saw that the parting was prolonged.\r\nThen she turned her back upon it. She had not gone very far, however,\r\nwhen she heard her sister slowly following her. She neither turned\r\nround nor waited for her; she knew what Charlotte was going to say.\r\nCharlotte, who at last overtook her, in fact presently began; she had\r\npassed her arm into Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you listen to me, dear, if I say something very particular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you are going to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brand feels\r\nvery badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gertrude, how can you treat him so?\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte demanded. And as\r\nher sister made no answer she added, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all he has done for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he done for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder you can ask, Gertrude. He has helped you so. You told me so\r\nyourself, a great many times. You told me that he helped you to\r\nstruggle with your\xe2\x80\x94your peculiarities. You told me that he had taught\r\nyou how to govern your temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Gertrude said nothing. Then, \xe2\x80\x9cWas my temper very bad?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not accusing you, Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing, then?\xe2\x80\x9d her sister demanded, with a short laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am pleading for Mr. Brand\xe2\x80\x94reminding you of all you owe him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given it all back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, still with her little laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can take back the virtue he imparted! I want to be wicked again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sister made her stop in the path, and fixed upon her, in the\r\ndarkness, a sweet, reproachful gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you talk this way I shall\r\nalmost believe it. Think of all we owe Mr. Brand. Think of how he has\r\nalways expected something of you. Think how much he has been to us.\r\nThink of his beautiful influence upon Clifford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, looking at her sister. \xe2\x80\x9cI know he is\r\nvery good. But he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak against Felix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelix is good,\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte answered, softly but promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cFelix is\r\nvery wonderful. Only he is so different. Mr. Brand is much nearer to\r\nus. I should never think of going to Felix with a trouble\xe2\x80\x94with a\r\nquestion. Mr. Brand is much more to us, Gertrude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very\xe2\x80\x94very good,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is more to you; yes,\r\nmuch more. Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d she added suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are in love with him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gertrude!\xe2\x80\x9d cried poor Charlotte; and her sister saw her blushing\r\nin the darkness.\r\n\r\nGertrude put her arm round her. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish he would marry you!\xe2\x80\x9d she went\r\non.\r\n\r\nCharlotte shook herself free. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not say such things!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed, beneath her breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like him more than you say, and he likes you more than he knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very cruel of you!\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte Wentworth murmured.\r\n\r\nBut if it was cruel Gertrude continued pitiless. \xe2\x80\x9cNot if it\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish he would marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to tell him so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gertrude, Gertrude!\xe2\x80\x9d her sister almost moaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if he speaks to me again about myself. I will say, \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nmarry Charlotte? She\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand times better than I.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _are_ wicked; you _are_ changed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it you can prevent it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\nprevent it by keeping him from speaking to me!\xe2\x80\x9d And with this she\r\nwalked away, very conscious of what she had done; measuring it and\r\nfinding a certain joy and a quickened sense of freedom in it.\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth was rather wide of the mark in suspecting that Clifford\r\nhad begun to pay unscrupulous compliments to his brilliant cousin; for\r\nthe young man had really more scruples than he received credit for in\r\nhis family. He had a certain transparent shamefacedness which was in\r\nitself a proof that he was not at his ease in dissipation. His\r\ncollegiate peccadilloes had aroused a domestic murmur as disagreeable\r\nto the young man as the creaking of his boots would have been to a\r\nhouse-breaker. Only, as the house-breaker would have simplified matters\r\nby removing his _chaussures_, it had seemed to Clifford that the\r\nshortest cut to comfortable relations with people\xe2\x80\x94relations which\r\nshould make him cease to think that when they spoke to him they meant\r\nsomething improving\xe2\x80\x94was to renounce all ambition toward a nefarious\r\ndevelopment. And, in fact, Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s ambition took the most\r\ncommendable form. He thought of himself in the future as the well-known\r\nand much-liked Mr. Wentworth, of Boston, who should, in the natural\r\ncourse of prosperity, have married his pretty cousin, Lizzie Acton;\r\nshould live in a wide-fronted house, in view of the Common; and should\r\ndrive, behind a light wagon, over the damp autumn roads, a pair of\r\nbeautifully matched sorrel horses. Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s vision of the coming\r\nyears was very simple; its most definite features were this element of\r\nfamiliar matrimony and the duplication of his resources for trotting.\r\nHe had not yet asked his cousin to marry him; but he meant to do so as\r\nsoon as he had taken his degree. Lizzie was serenely conscious of his\r\nintention, and she had made up her mind that he would improve. Her\r\nbrother, who was very fond of this light, quick, competent little\r\nLizzie, saw on his side no reason to interpose. It seemed to him a\r\ngraceful social law that Clifford and his sister should become engaged;\r\nhe himself was not engaged, but everyone else, fortunately, was not\r\nsuch a fool as he. He was fond of Clifford, as well, and had his own\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94of which it must be confessed he was a little ashamed\xe2\x80\x94of looking at\r\nthose aberrations which had led to the young man\xe2\x80\x99s compulsory\r\nretirement from the neighboring seat of learning. Acton had seen the\r\nworld, as he said to himself; he had been to China and had knocked\r\nabout among men. He had learned the essential difference between a nice\r\nyoung fellow and a mean young fellow, and was satisfied that there was\r\nno harm in Clifford. He believed\xe2\x80\x94although it must be added that he had\r\nnot quite the courage to declare it\xe2\x80\x94in the doctrine of wild oats, and\r\nthought it a useful preventive of superfluous fears. If Mr. Wentworth\r\nand Charlotte and Mr. Brand would only apply it in Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s case,\r\nthey would be happier; and Acton thought it a pity they should not be\r\nhappier. They took the boy\xe2\x80\x99s misdemeanors too much to heart; they\r\ntalked to him too solemnly; they frightened and bewildered him. Of\r\ncourse there was the great standard of morality, which forbade that a\r\nman should get tipsy, play at billiards for money, or cultivate his\r\nsensual consciousness; but what fear was there that poor Clifford was\r\ngoing to run a tilt at any great standard? It had, however, never\r\noccurred to Acton to dedicate the Baroness M\xc3\xbcnster to the redemption of\r\na refractory collegian. The instrument, here, would have seemed to him\r\nquite too complex for the operation. Felix, on the other hand, had\r\nspoken in obedience to the belief that the more charming a woman is the\r\nmore numerous, literally, are her definite social uses.\r\n\r\nEugenia herself, as we know, had plenty of leisure to enumerate her\r\nuses. As I have had the honor of intimating, she had come four thousand\r\nmiles to seek her fortune; and it is not to be supposed that after this\r\ngreat effort she could neglect any apparent aid to advancement. It is\r\nmy misfortune that in attempting to describe in a short compass the\r\ndeportment of this remarkable woman I am obliged to express things\r\nrather brutally. I feel this to be the case, for instance, when I say\r\nthat she had primarily detected such an aid to advancement in the\r\nperson of Robert Acton, but that she had afterwards remembered that a\r\nprudent archer has always a second bowstring. Eugenia was a woman of\r\nfinely-mingled motive, and her intentions were never sensibly gross.\r\nShe had a sort of aesthetic ideal for Clifford which seemed to her a\r\ndisinterested reason for taking him in hand. It was very well for a\r\nfresh-colored young gentleman to be ingenuous; but Clifford, really,\r\nwas crude. With such a pretty face he ought to have prettier manners.\r\nShe would teach him that, with a beautiful name, the expectation of a\r\nlarge property, and, as they said in Europe, a social position, an only\r\nson should know how to carry himself.\r\n\r\nOnce Clifford had begun to come and see her by himself and for himself,\r\nhe came very often. He hardly knew why he should come; he saw her\r\nalmost every evening at his father\xe2\x80\x99s house; he had nothing particular\r\nto say to her. She was not a young girl, and fellows of his age called\r\nonly upon young girls. He exaggerated her age; she seemed to him an old\r\nwoman; it was happy that the Baroness, with all her intelligence, was\r\nincapable of guessing this. But gradually it struck Clifford that\r\nvisiting old women might be, if not a natural, at least, as they say of\r\nsome articles of diet, an acquired taste. The Baroness was certainly a\r\nvery amusing old woman; she talked to him as no lady\xe2\x80\x94and indeed no\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x94had ever talked to him before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should go to Europe and make the tour,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him one\r\nafternoon. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, on leaving college you will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go,\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI know some fellows who have\r\nbeen to Europe. They say you can have better fun here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends. It depends upon your idea of fun. Your friends probably\r\nwere not introduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIntroduced?\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had no opportunity of going into society; they formed no\r\n_relations_.\xe2\x80\x9d This was one of a certain number of words that the\r\nBaroness often pronounced in the French manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey went to a ball, in Paris; I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there are balls and balls; especially in Paris. No, you must go,\r\nyou know; it is not a thing from which you can dispense yourself. You\r\nneed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean for your health, my poor child. I mean for your manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any manners!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Clifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my assenting to that, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nBaroness with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must go to Europe and get a few. You can\r\nget them better there. It is a pity you might not have come while I was\r\nliving in\xe2\x80\x94in Germany. I would have introduced you; I had a charming\r\nlittle circle. You would perhaps have been rather young; but the\r\nyounger one begins, I think, the better. Now, at any rate, you have no\r\ntime to lose, and when I return you must immediately come to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this, to Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s apprehension, was a great mixture\xe2\x80\x94his beginning\r\nyoung, Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s return to Europe, his being introduced to her charming\r\nlittle circle. What was he to begin, and what was her little circle?\r\nHis ideas about her marriage had a good deal of vagueness; but they\r\nwere in so far definite as that he felt it to be a matter not to be\r\nfreely mentioned. He sat and looked all round the room; he supposed she\r\nwas alluding in some way to her marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to Germany,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; it seemed to him the most\r\nconvenient thing to say.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a while, smiling with her lips, but not with her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have scruples?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScruples?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou young people, here, are very singular; one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know where to\r\nexpect you. When you are not extremely improper you are so terribly\r\nproper. I dare say you think that, owing to my irregular marriage, I\r\nlive with loose people. You were never more mistaken. I have been all\r\nthe more particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford, honestly distressed. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought such a\r\nthing as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very sure? I am convinced that your father does, and your\r\nsisters. They say to each other that here I am on my good behavior, but\r\nthat over there\xe2\x80\x94married by the left hand\xe2\x80\x94I associate with light women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clifford, energetically, \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t say such things as\r\nthat to each other!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they think them they had better say them,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness rejoined.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they can be contradicted. Please contradict that whenever you\r\nhear it, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of coming to see me on account of the\r\ncompany I keep. I have the honor of knowing more distinguished men, my\r\npoor child, than you are likely to see in a life-time. I see very few\r\nwomen; but those are women of rank. So, my dear young Puritan, you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. I am not in the least one of those who think that\r\nthe society of women who have lost their place in the _vrai monde_ is\r\nnecessary to form a young man. I have never taken that tone. I have\r\nkept my place myself, and I think we are a much better school than the\r\nothers. Trust me, Clifford, and I will prove that to you,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness\r\ncontinued, while she made the agreeable reflection that she could not,\r\nat least, be accused of perverting her young kinsman. \xe2\x80\x9cSo if you ever\r\nfall among thieves don\xe2\x80\x99t go about saying I sent you to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClifford thought it so comical that he should know\xe2\x80\x94in spite of her\r\nfigurative language\xe2\x80\x94what she meant, and that she should mean what he\r\nknew, that he could hardly help laughing a little, although he tried\r\nhard. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! oh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaugh out, laugh out, if I amuse you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cI am here\r\nfor that!\xe2\x80\x9d And Clifford thought her a very amusing person indeed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nremember,\xe2\x80\x9d she said on this occasion, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are coming\xe2\x80\x94next year\xe2\x80\x94to\r\npay me a visit over there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout a week afterwards she said to him, point-blank, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\nseriously making love to your little cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeriously making love\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94these words, on Madame M\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s lips, had to\r\nClifford\xe2\x80\x99s sense a portentous and embarrassing sound; he hesitated\r\nabout assenting, lest he should commit himself to more than he\r\nunderstood. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it if I was!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say it?\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cThose things ought\r\nto be known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether it is known or not,\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want people looking at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young man of your importance ought to learn to bear observation\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ncarry himself as if he were quite indifferent to it. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say,\r\nexactly, unconscious,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness explained. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he must seem to\r\nknow he is observed, and to think it natural he should be; but he must\r\nappear perfectly used to it. Now you haven\xe2\x80\x99t that, Clifford; you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t that at all. You must have that, you know. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you\r\nare not a young man of importance,\xe2\x80\x9d Eugenia added. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say anything\r\nso flat as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, you don\xe2\x80\x99t catch me saying that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you must come to Germany,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame M\xc3\xbcnster continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI will show\r\nyou how people can be talked about, and yet not seem to know it. You\r\nwill be talked about, of course, with me; it will be said you are my\r\nlover. I will show you how little one may mind that\xe2\x80\x94how little I shall\r\nmind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClifford sat staring, blushing and laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall mind it a good\r\ndeal!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, not too much, you know; that would be uncivil. But I give you\r\nleave to mind it a little; especially if you have a passion for Miss\r\nActon. _Voyons_; as regards that, you either have or you have not. It\r\nis very simple to say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to want me to know. If one is arranging a marriage, one\r\ntells one\xe2\x80\x99s friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not arranging anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to marry your cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I expect I shall do as I choose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness leaned her head upon the back of her chair and closed her\r\neyes, as if she were tired. Then opening them again, \xe2\x80\x9cYour cousin is\r\nvery charming!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is the prettiest girl in this place,\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford rejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In this place\xe2\x80\x99 is saying little; she would be charming anywhere. I am\r\nafraid you are entangled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not entangled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you engaged? At your age that is the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClifford looked at the Baroness with some audacity. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell no\r\none?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s as sacred as that\xe2\x80\x94no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then\xe2\x80\x94we are not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the great secret\xe2\x80\x94that you are not, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Baroness,\r\nwith a quick laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to hear it. You are altogether too\r\nyoung. A young man in your position must choose and compare; he must\r\nsee the world first. Depend upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou should not settle\r\nthat matter before you have come abroad and paid me that visit. There\r\nare several things I should like to call your attention to first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am rather afraid of that visit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to\r\nme it will be rather like going to school again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness looked at him a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no agreeable man who has not, at\r\nsome moment, been to school to a clever woman\xe2\x80\x94probably a little older\r\nthan himself. And you must be thankful when you get your instructions\r\ngratis. With me you would get it gratis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day Clifford told Lizzie Acton that the Baroness thought her\r\nthe most charming girl she had ever seen.\r\n\r\nLizzie shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think everything she says,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clifford, \xe2\x80\x9cis to be taken the\r\nopposite way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lizzie.\r\n\r\nClifford was going to remark that in this case the Baroness must desire\r\ngreatly to bring about a marriage between Mr. Clifford Wentworth and\r\nMiss Elizabeth Acton; but he resolved, on the whole, to suppress this\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Robert Acton, after Eugenia had come to his house, that\r\nsomething had passed between them which made them a good deal more\r\nintimate. It was hard to say exactly what, except her telling him that\r\nshe had taken her resolution with regard to the Prince Adolf; for\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s visit had made no difference in their relations. He\r\ncame to see her very often; but he had come to see her very often\r\nbefore. It was agreeable to him to find himself in her little\r\ndrawing-room; but this was not a new discovery. There was a change,\r\nhowever, in this sense: that if the Baroness had been a great deal in\r\nActon\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts before, she was now never out of them. From the first\r\nshe had been personally fascinating; but the fascination now had become\r\nintellectual as well. He was constantly pondering her words and\r\nmotions; they were as interesting as the factors in an algebraic\r\nproblem. This is saying a good deal; for Acton was extremely fond of\r\nmathematics. He asked himself whether it could be that he was in love\r\nwith her, and then hoped he was not; hoped it not so much for his own\r\nsake as for that of the amatory passion itself. If this was love, love\r\nhad been overrated. Love was a poetic impulse, and his own state of\r\nfeeling with regard to the Baroness was largely characterized by that\r\neminently prosaic sentiment\xe2\x80\x94curiosity. It was true, as Acton with his\r\nquietly cogitative habit observed to himself, that curiosity, pushed to\r\na given point, might become a romantic passion; and he certainly\r\nthought enough about this charming woman to make him restless and even\r\na little melancholy. It puzzled and vexed him at times to feel that he\r\nwas not more ardent. He was not in the least bent upon remaining a\r\nbachelor. In his younger years he had been\xe2\x80\x94or he had tried to be\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\nopinion that it would be a good deal \xe2\x80\x9cjollier\xe2\x80\x9d not to marry, and he had\r\nflattered himself that his single condition was something of a citadel.\r\nIt was a citadel, at all events, of which he had long since leveled the\r\noutworks. He had removed the guns from the ramparts; he had lowered the\r\ndraw-bridge across the moat. The draw-bridge had swayed lightly under\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s step; why should he not cause it to be raised again,\r\nso that she might be kept prisoner? He had an idea that she would\r\nbecome\xe2\x80\x94in time at least, and on learning the conveniences of the place\r\nfor making a lady comfortable\xe2\x80\x94a tolerably patient captive. But the\r\ndraw-bridge was never raised, and Acton\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant visitor was as free\r\nto depart as she had been to come. It was part of his curiosity to know\r\nwhy the deuce so susceptible a man was _not_ in love with so charming a\r\nwoman. If her various graces were, as I have said, the factors in an\r\nalgebraic problem, the answer to this question was the indispensable\r\nunknown quantity. The pursuit of the unknown quantity was extremely\r\nabsorbing; for the present it taxed all Acton\xe2\x80\x99s faculties.\r\n\r\nToward the middle of August he was obliged to leave home for some days;\r\nan old friend, with whom he had been associated in China, had begged\r\nhim to come to Newport, where he lay extremely ill. His friend got\r\nbetter, and at the end of a week Acton was released. I use the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9creleased\xe2\x80\x9d advisedly; for in spite of his attachment to his Chinese\r\ncomrade he had been but a half-hearted visitor. He felt as if he had\r\nbeen called away from the theatre during the progress of a remarkably\r\ninteresting drama. The curtain was up all this time, and he was losing\r\nthe fourth act; that fourth act which would have been so essential to a\r\njust appreciation of the fifth. In other words, he was thinking about\r\nthe Baroness, who, seen at this distance, seemed a truly brilliant\r\nfigure. He saw at Newport a great many pretty women, who certainly were\r\nfigures as brilliant as beautiful light dresses could make them; but\r\nthough they talked a great deal\xe2\x80\x94and the Baroness\xe2\x80\x99s strong point was\r\nperhaps also her conversation\xe2\x80\x94Madame M\xc3\xbcnster appeared to lose nothing\r\nby the comparison. He wished she had come to Newport too. Would it not\r\nbe possible to make up, as they said, a party for visiting the famous\r\nwatering-place and invite Eugenia to join it? It was true that the\r\ncomplete satisfaction would be to spend a fortnight at Newport with\r\nEugenia alone. It would be a great pleasure to see her, in society,\r\ncarry everything before her, as he was sure she would do. When Acton\r\ncaught himself thinking these thoughts he began to walk up and down,\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, frowning a little and looking at the\r\nfloor. What did it prove\xe2\x80\x94for it certainly proved something\xe2\x80\x94this lively\r\ndisposition to be \xe2\x80\x9coff\xe2\x80\x9d somewhere with Madame M\xc3\xbcnster, away from all\r\nthe rest of them? Such a vision, certainly, seemed a refined\r\nimplication of matrimony, after the Baroness should have formally got\r\nrid of her informal husband. At any rate, Acton, with his\r\ncharacteristic discretion, forbore to give expression to whatever else\r\nit might imply, and the narrator of these incidents is not obliged to\r\nbe more definite.\r\n\r\nHe returned home rapidly, and, arriving in the afternoon, lost as\r\nlittle time as possible in joining the familiar circle at Mr.\r\nWentworth\xe2\x80\x99s. On reaching the house, however, he found the piazzas\r\nempty. The doors and windows were open, and their emptiness was made\r\nclear by the shafts of lamp-light from the parlors. Entering the house,\r\nhe found Mr. Wentworth sitting alone in one of these apartments,\r\nengaged in the perusal of the _North American Review_. After they had\r\nexchanged greetings and his cousin had made discreet inquiry about his\r\njourney, Acton asked what had become of Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are scattered about, amusing themselves as usual,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\nman. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw Charlotte, a short time since, seated, with Mr. Brand, upon\r\nthe piazza. They were conversing with their customary animation. I\r\nsuppose they have joined her sister, who, for the hundredth time, was\r\ndoing the honors of the garden to her foreign cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you mean Felix,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton. And on Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassenting, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sister has not come this evening. You must have seen her at\r\nhome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I proposed to her to come. She declined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizzie, I suppose, was expecting a visitor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, with a\r\nkind of solemn slyness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she was expecting Clifford, he had not turned up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth, at this intelligence, closed the _North American Review_\r\nand remarked that he had understood Clifford to say that he was going\r\nto see his cousin. Privately, he reflected that if Lizzie Acton had had\r\nno news of his son, Clifford must have gone to Boston for the evening:\r\nan unnatural course of a summer night, especially when accompanied with\r\ndisingenuous representations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must remember that he has two cousins,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, laughing. And\r\nthen, coming to the point, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Lizzie is not here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cneither\r\napparently is the Baroness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth stared a moment, and remembered that queer proposition of\r\nFelix\xe2\x80\x99s. For a moment he did not know whether it was not to be wished\r\nthat Clifford, after all, might have gone to Boston. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Baroness has\r\nnot honored us tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has not come over for three\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she ill?\xe2\x80\x9d Acton asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have been to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, \xe2\x80\x9cI infer she has tired of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon pretended to sit down, but he was restless; he found it\r\nimpossible to talk with Mr. Wentworth. At the end of ten minutes he\r\ntook up his hat and said that he thought he would \xe2\x80\x9cgo off.\xe2\x80\x9d It was very\r\nlate; it was ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nHis quiet-faced kinsman looked at him a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\nActon hesitated, and then answered that he had proposed to go over and\r\ntake a look at the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are honest, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo are you, if you come to that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Acton, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I be honest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man opened the _North American_ again, and read a few lines.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we have ever had any virtue among us, we had better keep hold of it\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He was not quoting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a Baroness among us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what we must keep\r\nhold of!\xe2\x80\x9d He was too impatient to see Madame M\xc3\xbcnster again to wonder\r\nwhat Mr. Wentworth was talking about. Nevertheless, after he had passed\r\nout of the house and traversed the garden and the little piece of road\r\nthat separated him from Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s provisional residence, he stopped a\r\nmoment outside. He stood in her little garden; the long window of her\r\nparlor was open, and he could see the white curtains, with the\r\nlamp-light shining through them, swaying softly to and fro in the warm\r\nnight wind. There was a sort of excitement in the idea of seeing Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster again; he became aware that his heart was beating rather faster\r\nthan usual. It was this that made him stop, with a half-amused\r\nsurprise. But in a moment he went along the piazza, and, approaching\r\nthe open window, tapped upon its lintel with his stick. He could see\r\nthe Baroness within; she was standing in the middle of the room. She\r\ncame to the window and pulled aside the curtain; then she stood looking\r\nat him a moment. She was not smiling; she seemed serious.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cMais entrez donc!\xe2\x80\x9d_ she said at last. Acton passed in across the\r\nwindow-sill; he wondered, for an instant, what was the matter with her.\r\nBut the next moment she had begun to smile and had put out her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter late than never,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very kind of you to come at\r\nthis hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just returned from my journey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, very kind, very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, looking about her where to\r\nsit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went first to the other house,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI expected to find\r\nyou there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had sunk into her usual chair; but she got up again, and began to\r\nmove about the room. Acton had laid down his hat and stick; he was\r\nlooking at her, conscious that there was in fact a great charm in\r\nseeing her again. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I ought to tell you to sit\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late to begin a visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too early to end one,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton declared; \xe2\x80\x9cand we needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind the\r\nbeginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him again, and, after a moment, dropped once more into\r\nher low chair, while he took a place near her. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in the middle,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWas that where we were when you went away? No, I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t been to the other house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yesterday, nor the day before, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many days it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are tired of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton.\r\n\r\nShe leaned back in her chair; her arms were folded. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a terrible\r\naccusation, but I have not the courage to defend myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not attacking you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cI expected something of this\r\nkind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a proof of extreme intelligence. I hope you enjoyed your\r\njourney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI would much rather have been here with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you _are_ attacking me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are contrasting\r\nmy inconstancy with your own fidelity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess I never get tired of people I like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are not a poor wicked foreign woman, with irritable nerves and\r\na sophisticated mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething has happened to you since I went away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, changing\r\nhis place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour going away\xe2\x80\x94that is what has happened to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that you have missed me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had meant to say it, it would not be worth your making a note of.\r\nI am very dishonest and my compliments are worthless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon was silent for some moments. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have broken down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster left her chair, and began to move about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly for a moment. I shall pull myself together again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not take it too hard. If you are bored, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid to say so\xe2\x80\x94to me at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say such things as that,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshould encourage me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admire your patience; that is encouraging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even say that. When you talk of my patience you are\r\ndisloyal to your own people. Patience implies suffering; and what have\r\nI had to suffer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not hunger, not unkindness, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, laughing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, we all admire your patience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou all detest me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Baroness, with a sudden vehemence,\r\nturning her back toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make it hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, getting up, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a man to say something\r\ntender to you.\xe2\x80\x9d This evening there was something particularly striking\r\nand touching about her; an unwonted softness and a look of suppressed\r\nemotion. He felt himself suddenly appreciating the fact that she had\r\nbehaved very well. She had come to this quiet corner of the world under\r\nthe weight of a cruel indignity, and she had been so gracefully,\r\nmodestly thankful for the rest she found there. She had joined that\r\nsimple circle over the way; she had mingled in its plain, provincial\r\ntalk; she had shared its meagre and savorless pleasures. She had set\r\nherself a task, and she had rigidly performed it. She had conformed to\r\nthe angular conditions of New England life, and she had had the tact\r\nand pluck to carry it off as if she liked them. Acton felt a more\r\ndownright need than he had ever felt before to tell her that he admired\r\nher and that she struck him as a very superior woman. All along,\r\nhitherto, he had been on his guard with her; he had been cautious,\r\nobservant, suspicious. But now a certain light tumult in his blood\r\nseemed to tell him that a finer degree of confidence in this charming\r\nwoman would be its own reward. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t detest you,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean. At any rate, I speak for myself; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nanything about the others. Very likely, you detest them for the dull\r\nlife they make you lead. Really, it would give me a sort of pleasure to\r\nhear you say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia had been looking at the door on the other side of the room; now\r\nshe slowly turned her eyes toward Robert Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be the\r\nmotive,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cof a man like you\xe2\x80\x94an honest man, a _galant\r\nhomme_\xe2\x80\x94in saying so base a thing as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it sound very base?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Acton, candidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it does,\r\nand I thank you for telling me so. Of course, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\r\nliterally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness stood looking at him. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nThis question was difficult to answer, and Acton, feeling the least bit\r\nfoolish, walked to the open window and looked out. He stood there,\r\nthinking a moment, and then he turned back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that document\r\nthat you were to send to Germany,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou called it your\r\n\xe2\x80\x98renunciation.\xe2\x80\x99 Did you ever send it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s eyes expanded; she looked very grave. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a singular\r\nanswer to my question!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t an answer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cI have wished to ask you, many\r\ntimes. I thought it probable you would tell me yourself. The question,\r\non my part, seems abrupt now; but it would be abrupt at any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness was silent a moment; and then, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have told you\r\ntoo much!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThis declaration appeared to Acton to have a certain force; he had\r\nindeed a sense of asking more of her than he offered her. He returned\r\nto the window, and watched, for a moment, a little star that twinkled\r\nthrough the lattice of the piazza. There were at any rate offers enough\r\nhe could make; perhaps he had hitherto not been sufficiently explicit\r\nin doing so. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would ask something of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nothing I can do for you? If you can\xe2\x80\x99t stand this dull life\r\nany more, let me amuse you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness had sunk once more into a chair, and she had taken up a\r\nfan which she held, with both hands, to her mouth. Over the top of the\r\nfan her eyes were fixed on him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very strange tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, with a little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do anything in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, standing in front of\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to travel about and see something of the\r\ncountry? Won\xe2\x80\x99t you go to Niagara? You ought to see Niagara, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith you, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be delighted to take you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon looked at her, smiling, and yet with a serious air. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes;\r\nwe might go alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were not what you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI should feel insulted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean\xe2\x80\x94what I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were one of the gentlemen I have been used to all my life. If\r\nyou were not a queer Bostonian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the gentlemen you have been used to have taught you to expect\r\ninsults,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad I am what I am. You had much better\r\ncome to Niagara.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to \xe2\x80\x98amuse\xe2\x80\x99 me,\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness declared, \xe2\x80\x9cyou need go to no\r\nfurther expense. You amuse me very effectually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down opposite to her; she still held her fan up to her face,\r\nwith her eyes only showing above it. There was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, and\r\nthen he said, returning to his former question, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you sent that\r\ndocument to Germany?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence. The expressive eyes of Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster seemed, however, half to break it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you\xe2\x80\x94at Niagara!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe had hardly spoken when the door at the further end of the room\r\nopened\xe2\x80\x94the door upon which, some minutes previous, Eugenia had fixed\r\nher gaze. Clifford Wentworth stood there, blushing and looking rather\r\nawkward. The Baroness rose, quickly, and Acton, more slowly, did the\r\nsame. Clifford gave him no greeting; he was looking at Eugenia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you were here?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Acton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in Felix\xe2\x80\x99s studio,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame M\xc3\xbcnster. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to see his\r\nsketches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClifford looked at Robert Acton, but said nothing; he only fanned\r\nhimself with his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou chose a bad moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton; \xe2\x80\x9cyou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmuch light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour candle went out?\xe2\x80\x9d Eugenia asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should have come back here\r\nand lighted it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClifford looked at her a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I have\xe2\x80\x94come back. But I have left\r\nthe candle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very stupid, my poor boy. You had better\r\ngo home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford, \xe2\x80\x9cgood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you a word to throw to a man when he has safely returned from\r\na dangerous journey?\xe2\x80\x9d Acton asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\xe2\x80\x94I thought you were\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\npaused, looking at the Baroness again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought I was at Newport, eh? So I was\xe2\x80\x94this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, clever child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame M\xc3\xbcnster, over her shoulder.\r\n\r\nClifford stared at her\xe2\x80\x94not at all like a clever child; and then, with\r\none of his little facetious growls, took his departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Acton, when he was gone. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nseemed rather in a muddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia, who was near the window, glanced out, listening a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94the matter\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t say such things here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean that he had been drinking a little, you can say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drink any more. I have cured him. And in return\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nlove with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Acton\xe2\x80\x99s turn to stare. He instantly thought of his sister; but\r\nhe said nothing about her. He began to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at his\r\npassion! But I wonder at his forsaking your society for that of your\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s paint-brushes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia was silent a little. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had not been in the studio. I invented\r\nthat at the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInvented it? For what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has an idea of being romantic. He has adopted the habit of coming\r\nto see me at midnight\xe2\x80\x94passing only through the orchard and through\r\nFelix\xe2\x80\x99s painting-room, which has a door opening that way. It seems to\r\namuse him,\xe2\x80\x9d added Eugenia, with a little laugh.\r\n\r\nActon felt more surprise than he confessed to, for this was a new view\r\nof Clifford, whose irregularities had hitherto been quite without the\r\nromantic element. He tried to laugh again, but he felt rather too\r\nserious, and after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation his seriousness explained\r\nitself. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t encourage him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must not be\r\ninconstant to poor Lizzie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know they are decidedly intimate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Eugenia, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9chas she\xe2\x80\x94has she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat she has. But I always supposed\r\nthat Clifford had a desire to make himself agreeable to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _par exemple!_\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe little monster! The\r\nnext time he becomes sentimental I will him tell that he ought to be\r\nashamed of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon was silent a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better say nothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had told him as much already, on general grounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nBaroness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in this country, you know, the relations of young people\r\nare so extraordinary that one is quite at sea. They are not engaged\r\nwhen you would quite say they ought to be. Take Charlotte Wentworth,\r\nfor instance, and that young ecclesiastic. If I were her father I\r\nshould insist upon his marrying her; but it appears to be thought there\r\nis no urgency. On the other hand, you suddenly learn that a boy of\r\ntwenty and a little girl who is still with her governess\xe2\x80\x94your sister\r\nhas no governess? Well, then, who is never away from her mamma\xe2\x80\x94a young\r\ncouple, in short, between whom you have noticed nothing beyond an\r\nexchange of the childish pleasantries characteristic of their age, are\r\non the point of setting up as man and wife.\xe2\x80\x9d The Baroness spoke with a\r\ncertain exaggerated volubility which was in contrast with the languid\r\ngrace that had characterized her manner before Clifford made his\r\nappearance. It seemed to Acton that there was a spark of irritation in\r\nher eye\xe2\x80\x94a note of irony (as when she spoke of Lizzie being never away\r\nfrom her mother) in her voice. If Madame M\xc3\xbcnster was irritated, Robert\r\nActon was vaguely mystified; she began to move about the room again,\r\nand he looked at her without saying anything. Presently she took out\r\nher watch, and, glancing at it, declared that it was three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\nthe morning and that he must go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not been here an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand they are still sitting up\r\nat the other house. You can see the lights. Your brother has not come\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, at the other house,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Eugenia, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are terrible people! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what they may do over there. I am a quiet little humdrum\r\nwoman; I have rigid rules and I keep them. One of them is not to have\r\nvisitors in the small hours\xe2\x80\x94especially clever men like you. So\r\ngood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDecidedly, the Baroness was incisive; and though Acton bade her\r\ngood-night and departed, he was still a good deal mystified.\r\n\r\nThe next day Clifford Wentworth came to see Lizzie, and Acton, who was\r\nat home and saw him pass through the garden, took note of the\r\ncircumstance. He had a natural desire to make it tally with Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s account of Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s disaffection; but his ingenuity,\r\nfinding itself unequal to the task, resolved at last to ask help of the\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s candor. He waited till he saw him going away, and then he\r\nwent out and overtook him in the grounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish very much you would answer me a question,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nwere you doing, last night, at Madame M\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClifford began to laugh and to blush, by no means like a young man with\r\na romantic secret. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly what I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I want to tell you the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford; \xe2\x80\x9cand unless I know\r\nit perhaps I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had stopped in a garden path; Acton looked hard at his rosy young\r\nkinsman. \xe2\x80\x9cShe said she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fancy what had got into you; you\r\nappeared to have taken a violent dislike to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClifford stared, looking a little alarmed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, come,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that when\xe2\x80\x94for common civility\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94you came occasionally to the\r\nhouse you left her alone and spent your time in Felix\xe2\x80\x99s studio, under\r\npretext of looking at his sketches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Clifford, again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever know me to tell an untruth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, lots of them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford, seeing an opening, out of the\r\ndiscussion, for his sarcastic powers. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you were my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew someone was there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe heard you coming in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon meditated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had been with the Baroness, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in the parlor. We heard your step outside. I thought it was my\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on that,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Acton, \xe2\x80\x9cyou ran away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me to go\xe2\x80\x94to go out by the studio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon meditated more intensely; if there had been a chair at hand he\r\nwould have sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should she wish you not to meet your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford, \xe2\x80\x9cfather doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to see me there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon looked askance at his companion and forbore to make any comment\r\nupon this assertion. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he said so,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto the Baroness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said so\xe2\x80\x94in so many\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94to me. But I know it worries him; and I want to stop worrying\r\nhim. The Baroness knows it, and she wants me to stop, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo stop coming to see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that; but to stop worrying father. Eugenia knows\r\neverything,\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford added, with an air of knowingness of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, interrogatively, \xe2\x80\x9cEugenia knows everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knew it was not father coming in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClifford blushed and laughed afresh. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was afraid it was. And\r\nbesides, she told me to go, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she think it was I?\xe2\x80\x9d Acton asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Robert Acton reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou came back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of the studio,\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cThe door was\r\nlocked, and Felix has nailed some planks across the lower half of the\r\nconfounded windows to make the light come in from above. So they were\r\nno use. I waited there a good while, and then, suddenly, I felt\r\nashamed. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be hiding away from my own father. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand it any longer. I bolted out, and when I found it was you I was a\r\nlittle flurried. But Eugenia carried it off, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d Clifford\r\nadded, in the tone of a young humorist whose perception had not been\r\npermanently clouded by the sense of his own discomfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautifully!\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen one\r\nremembers that you were very imprudent and that she must have been a\r\ngood deal annoyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clifford, with the indifference of a young man who feels\r\nthat however he may have failed of felicity in behavior he is extremely\r\njust in his impressions, \xe2\x80\x9cEugenia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for anything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon hesitated a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for telling me this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlast. And then, laying his hand on Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cTell\r\nme one thing more: are you by chance a little in love with the\r\nBaroness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford, almost shaking off his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first sunday that followed Robert Acton\xe2\x80\x99s return from Newport\r\nwitnessed a change in the brilliant weather that had long prevailed.\r\nThe rain began to fall and the day was cold and dreary. Mr. Wentworth\r\nand his daughters put on overshoes and went to church, and Felix Young,\r\nwithout overshoes, went also, holding an umbrella over Gertrude. It is\r\nto be feared that, in the whole observance, this was the privilege he\r\nmost highly valued. The Baroness remained at home; she was in neither a\r\ncheerful nor a devotional mood. She had, however, never been, during\r\nher residence in the United States, what is called a regular attendant\r\nat divine service; and on this particular Sunday morning of which I\r\nbegan with speaking she stood at the window of her little drawing-room,\r\nwatching the long arm of a rose tree that was attached to her piazza,\r\nbut a portion of which had disengaged itself, sway to and fro, shake\r\nand gesticulate, against the dusky drizzle of the sky. Every now and\r\nthen, in a gust of wind, the rose tree scattered a shower of\r\nwater-drops against the window-pane; it appeared to have a kind of\r\nhuman movement\xe2\x80\x94a menacing, warning intention. The room was very cold;\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster put on a shawl and walked about. Then she determined to\r\nhave some fire; and summoning her ancient negress, the contrast of\r\nwhose polished ebony and whose crimson turban had been at first a\r\nsource of satisfaction to her, she made arrangements for the production\r\nof a crackling flame. This old woman\xe2\x80\x99s name was Azarina. The Baroness\r\nhad begun by thinking that there would be a savory wildness in her\r\ntalk, and, for amusement, she had encouraged her to chatter. But\r\nAzarina was dry and prim; her conversation was anything but African;\r\nshe reminded Eugenia of the tiresome old ladies she met in society. She\r\nknew, however, how to make a fire; so that after she had laid the logs,\r\nEugenia, who was terribly bored, found a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentertainment in sitting and watching them blaze and sputter. She had\r\nthought it very likely Robert Acton would come and see her; she had not\r\nmet him since that infelicitous evening. But the morning waned without\r\nhis coming; several times she thought she heard his step on the piazza;\r\nbut it was only a window-shutter shaking in a rain-gust. The Baroness,\r\nsince the beginning of that episode in her career of which a slight\r\nsketch has been attempted in these pages, had had many moments of\r\nirritation. But today her irritation had a peculiar keenness; it\r\nappeared to feed upon itself. It urged her to do something; but it\r\nsuggested no particularly profitable line of action. If she could have\r\ndone something at the moment, on the spot, she would have stepped upon\r\na European steamer and turned her back, with a kind of rapture, upon\r\nthat profoundly mortifying failure, her visit to her American\r\nrelations. It is not exactly apparent why she should have termed this\r\nenterprise a failure, inasmuch as she had been treated with the highest\r\ndistinction for which allowance had been made in American institutions.\r\nHer irritation came, at bottom, from the sense, which, always present,\r\nhad suddenly grown acute, that the social soil on this big, vague\r\ncontinent was somehow not adapted for growing those plants whose\r\nfragrance she especially inclined to inhale and by which she liked to\r\nsee herself surrounded\xe2\x80\x94a species of vegetation for which she carried a\r\ncollection of seedlings, as we may say, in her pocket. She found her\r\nchief happiness in the sense of exerting a certain power and making a\r\ncertain impression; and now she felt the annoyance of a rather wearied\r\nswimmer who, on nearing shore, to land, finds a smooth straight wall of\r\nrock when he had counted upon a clean firm beach. Her power, in the\r\nAmerican air, seemed to have lost its prehensile attributes; the smooth\r\nwall of rock was insurmountable. _\xe2\x80\x9cSurely je n\xe2\x80\x99en suis pas l\xc3\xa0,\xe2\x80\x9d_ she\r\nsaid to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I let it make me uncomfortable that a Mr. Robert\r\nActon shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t honor me with a visit!\xe2\x80\x9d Yet she was vexed that he had\r\nnot come; and she was vexed at her vexation.\r\n\r\nHer brother, at least, came in, stamping in the hall and shaking the\r\nwet from his coat. In a moment he entered the room, with a glow in his\r\ncheek and half-a-dozen rain-drops glistening on his moustache. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\r\nhave a fire,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cLes beaux jours sont pass\xc3\xa9s,\xe2\x80\x9d_ replied the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never! They have only begun,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix declared, planting himself\r\nbefore the hearth. He turned his back to the fire, placed his hands\r\nbehind him, extended his legs and looked away through the window with\r\nan expression of face which seemed to denote the perception of\r\nrose-color even in the tints of a wet Sunday.\r\n\r\nHis sister, from her chair, looked up at him, watching him; and what\r\nshe saw in his face was not grateful to her present mood. She was\r\npuzzled by many things, but her brother\xe2\x80\x99s disposition was a frequent\r\nsource of wonder to her. I say frequent and not constant, for there\r\nwere long periods during which she gave her attention to other\r\nproblems. Sometimes she had said to herself that his happy temper, his\r\neternal gaiety, was an affectation, a _pose_; but she was vaguely\r\nconscious that during the present summer he had been a highly\r\nsuccessful comedian. They had never yet had an explanation; she had not\r\nknown the need of one. Felix was presumably following the bent of his\r\ndisinterested genius, and she felt that she had no advice to give him\r\nthat he would understand. With this, there was always a certain element\r\nof comfort about Felix\xe2\x80\x94the assurance that he would not interfere. He\r\nwas very delicate, this pure-minded Felix; in effect, he was her\r\nbrother, and Madame M\xc3\xbcnster felt that there was a great propriety,\r\nevery way, in that. It is true that Felix was delicate; he was not fond\r\nof explanations with his sister; this was one of the very few things in\r\nthe world about which he was uncomfortable. But now he was not thinking\r\nof anything uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia at last, \xe2\x80\x9cdo stop making _les yeux doux_\r\nat the rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure. I will make them at you!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Eugenia, in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you propose to\r\nremain in this lovely spot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix stared. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to go away\xe2\x80\x94already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Already\xe2\x80\x99 is delicious. I am not so happy as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix dropped into a chair, looking at the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is I _am_\r\nhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in his light, clear tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you propose to spend your life in making love to Gertrude\r\nWentworth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, smiling sidewise at his sister.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness returned his glance, much more gravely; and then, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nlike her?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d Felix demanded.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness was silent a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI will answer you in the words of\r\nthe gentleman who was asked if he liked music: _\xe2\x80\x98Je ne la crains\r\npas!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe admires you immensely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that. Other women should not admire one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey should dislike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Madame M\xc3\xbcnster hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cThey should hate me! It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of\r\nthe time I have been losing here that they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo time is lost in which one has been happy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, with a\r\nbright sententiousness which may well have been a little irritating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in which,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined his sister, with a harsher laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cone has\r\nsecured the affections of a young lady with a fortune!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix explained, very candidly and seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI have secured\r\nGertrude\xe2\x80\x99s affection, but I am by no means sure that I have secured her\r\nfortune. That may come\xe2\x80\x94or it may not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, it _may!_ That\xe2\x80\x99s the great point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends upon her father. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t smile upon our union. You know\r\nhe wants her to marry Mr. Brand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease to put on a\r\nlog.\xe2\x80\x9d Felix complied with her request and sat watching the quickening\r\nof the flame. Presently his sister added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you propose to elope\r\nwith mademoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to do anything that\xe2\x80\x99s disagreeable to Mr.\r\nWentworth. He has been far too kind to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must choose between pleasing yourself and pleasing him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to please everyone!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Felix, joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a good\r\nconscience. I made up my mind at the outset that it was not my place to\r\nmake love to Gertrude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, to simplify matters, she made love to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix looked at his sister with sudden gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say you are not\r\nafraid of her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps you ought to be\xe2\x80\x94a little. She\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nvery clever person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to see it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Baroness. Her brother, making no\r\nrejoinder, leaned back in his chair, and there was a long silence. At\r\nlast, with an altered accent, Madame M\xc3\xbcnster put another question. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nexpect, at any rate, to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be greatly disappointed if we don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA disappointment or two will do you good!\xe2\x80\x9d the Baroness declared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, afterwards, do you mean to turn American?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me I am a very good American already. But we shall go to\r\nEurope. Gertrude wants extremely to see the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, like me, when I came here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, with a little\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not like you,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix rejoined, looking at his sister with a\r\ncertain gentle seriousness. While he looked at her she rose from her\r\nchair, and he also got up. \xe2\x80\x9cGertrude is not at all like you,\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\non; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in her own way she is almost as clever.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused a moment;\r\nhis soul was full of an agreeable feeling and of a lively disposition\r\nto express it. His sister, to his spiritual vision, was always like the\r\nlunar disk when only a part of it is lighted. The shadow on this bright\r\nsurface seemed to him to expand and to contract; but whatever its\r\nproportions, he always appreciated the moonlight. He looked at the\r\nBaroness, and then he kissed her. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very much in love with\r\nGertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Eugenia turned away and walked about the room, and\r\nFelix continued. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is very interesting, and very different from what\r\nshe seems. She has never had a chance. She is very brilliant. We will\r\ngo to Europe and amuse ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness had gone to the window, where she stood looking out. The\r\nday was drearier than ever; the rain was doggedly falling. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, to\r\namuse yourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cyou had decidedly better go to\r\nEurope!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she turned round, looking at her brother. A chair stood\r\nnear her; she leaned her hands upon the back of it. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\r\nis very good of me,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto come all this way with you simply\r\nto see you properly married\xe2\x80\x94if properly it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it will be properly!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix, with light eagerness.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness gave a little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are thinking only of yourself,\r\nand you don\xe2\x80\x99t answer my question. While you are amusing yourself\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nthe brilliant Gertrude\xe2\x80\x94what shall I be doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cVous serez de la partie!\xe2\x80\x9d_ cried Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you: I should spoil it.\xe2\x80\x9d The Baroness dropped her eyes for some\r\nmoments. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you propose, however, to leave me here?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\nFelix smiled at her. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest sister, where you are concerned I\r\nnever propose. I execute your commands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are the most heartless\r\nperson living. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that I am in trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw that you were not cheerful, and I gave you some good news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let me give you some news,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou probably\r\nwill not have discovered it for yourself. Robert Acton wants to marry\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I had not discovered that. But I quite understand it. Why does it\r\nmake you unhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I can\xe2\x80\x99t decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept him, accept him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix, joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the best fellow\r\nin the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is immensely in love with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he has a large fortune. Permit me in turn to remind you of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am perfectly aware of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a great item in\r\nhis favor. I am terribly candid.\xe2\x80\x9d And she left her place and came\r\nnearer her brother, looking at him hard. He was turning over several\r\nthings; she was wondering in what manner he really understood her.\r\n\r\nThere were several ways of understanding her: there was what she said,\r\nand there was what she meant, and there was something, between the two,\r\nthat was neither. It is probable that, in the last analysis, what she\r\nmeant was that Felix should spare her the necessity of stating the case\r\nmore exactly and should hold himself commissioned to assist her by all\r\nhonorable means to marry the best fellow in the world. But in all this\r\nit was never discovered what Felix understood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce you have your liberty, what are your objections?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, try a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am trying now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia. \xe2\x80\x9cI should succeed better if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlive here. I could never live here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake him go to Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there you speak of happiness based upon violent effort,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nBaroness rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not what I am looking for. He would never\r\nlive in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would live anywhere, with you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, gallantly.\r\n\r\nHis sister looked at him still, with a ray of penetration in her\r\ncharming eyes; then she turned away again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, at all events,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe presently went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if it had been said of me that I had come\r\nover here to seek my fortune it would have to be added that I have\r\nfound it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave it lying!\xe2\x80\x9d urged Felix, with smiling solemnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you for your interest,\xe2\x80\x9d his sister declared,\r\nafter a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cBut promise me one thing: _pas de z\xc3\xa8le!_ If Mr. Acton\r\nshould ask you to plead his cause, excuse yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall certainly have the excuse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have a cause\r\nof my own to plead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he should talk of me\xe2\x80\x94favorably,\xe2\x80\x9d Eugenia continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwarn him\r\nagainst dangerous illusions. I detest importunities; I want to decide\r\nat my leisure, with my eyes open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be discreet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept to you. To you I will say,\r\nAccept him outright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had advanced to the open doorway, and she stood looking at him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill go and dress and think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and he heard her moving\r\nslowly to her apartments.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the rain stopped, and just afterwards there was a\r\ngreat flaming, flickering, trickling sunset. Felix sat in his\r\npainting-room and did some work; but at last, as the light, which had\r\nnot been brilliant, began to fade, he laid down his brushes and came\r\nout to the little piazza of the cottage. Here he walked up and down for\r\nsome time, looking at the splendid blaze of the western sky and saying,\r\nas he had often said before, that this was certainly the country of\r\nsunsets. There was something in these glorious deeps of fire that\r\nquickened his imagination; he always found images and promises in the\r\nwestern sky. He thought of a good many things\xe2\x80\x94of roaming about the\r\nworld with Gertrude Wentworth; he seemed to see their possible\r\nadventures, in a glowing frieze, between the cloud-bars; then of what\r\nEugenia had just been telling him. He wished very much that Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster would make a comfortable and honorable marriage. Presently, as\r\nthe sunset expanded and deepened, the fancy took him of making a note\r\nof so magnificent a piece of coloring. He returned to his studio and\r\nfetched out a small panel, with his palette and brushes, and, placing\r\nthe panel against a window-sill, he began to daub with great gusto.\r\nWhile he was so occupied he saw Mr. Brand, in the distance, slowly come\r\ndown from Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s house, nursing a large folded umbrella. He\r\nwalked with a joyless, meditative tread, and his eyes were bent upon\r\nthe ground. Felix poised his brush for a moment, watching him; then, by\r\na sudden impulse, as he drew nearer, advanced to the garden-gate and\r\nsignaled to him\xe2\x80\x94the palette and bunch of brushes contributing to this\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand stopped and started; then he appeared to decide to accept\r\nFelix\xe2\x80\x99s invitation. He came out of Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s gate and passed\r\nalong the road; after which he entered the little garden of the\r\ncottage. Felix had gone back to his sunset; but he made his visitor\r\nwelcome while he rapidly brushed it in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted so much to speak to you that I thought I would call you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, in the friendliest tone. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the more that you have been to see\r\nme so little. You have come to see my sister; I know that. But you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t come to see me\xe2\x80\x94the celebrated artist. Artists are very\r\nsensitive, you know; they notice those things.\xe2\x80\x9d And Felix turned round,\r\nsmiling, with a brush in his mouth.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand stood there with a certain blank, candid majesty, pulling\r\ntogether the large flaps of his umbrella. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I come to see\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of Art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would sound very conceited, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cif I were to\r\nsay that it would be a good little chance for you to learn something.\r\nYou would ask me why you should learn; and I should have no answer to\r\nthat. I suppose a minister has no need for Art, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has need for good temper, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand, with decision.\r\n\r\nFelix jumped up, with his palette on his thumb and a movement of the\r\nliveliest deprecation. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because I keep you standing there while\r\nI splash my red paint! I beg a thousand pardons! You see what bad\r\nmanners Art gives a man; and how right you are to let it alone. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you should stand, either. The piazza, as you see, is\r\nornamented with rustic chairs; though indeed I ought to warn you that\r\nthey have nails in the wrong places. I was just making a note of that\r\nsunset. I never saw such a blaze of different reds. It looks as if the\r\nCelestial City were in flames, eh? If that were really the case I\r\nsuppose it would be the business of you theologians to put out the\r\nfire. Fancy me\xe2\x80\x94an ungodly artist\xe2\x80\x94quietly sitting down to paint it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand had always credited Felix Young with a certain impudence, but\r\nit appeared to him that on this occasion his impudence was so great as\r\nto make a special explanation\xe2\x80\x94or even an apology\xe2\x80\x94necessary. And the\r\nimpression, it must be added, was sufficiently natural. Felix had at\r\nall times a brilliant assurance of manner which was simply the vehicle\r\nof his good spirits and his good will; but at present he had a special\r\ndesign, and as he would have admitted that the design was audacious, so\r\nhe was conscious of having summoned all the arts of conversation to his\r\naid. But he was so far from desiring to offend his visitor that he was\r\nrapidly asking himself what personal compliment he could pay the young\r\nclergyman that would gratify him most. If he could think of it, he was\r\nprepared to pay it down. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been preaching one of your beautiful\r\nsermons today?\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly asked, laying down his palette. This was\r\nnot what Felix had been trying to think of, but it was a tolerable\r\nstop-gap.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand frowned\xe2\x80\x94as much as a man can frown who has very fair, soft\r\neyebrows, and, beneath them, very gentle, tranquil eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have\r\nnot preached any sermon today. Did you bring me over here for the\r\npurpose of making that inquiry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix saw that he was irritated, and he regretted it immensely; but he\r\nhad no fear of not being, in the end, agreeable to Mr. Brand. He looked\r\nat him, smiling and laying his hand on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not for\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94not for that. I wanted to ask you something; I wanted to tell you\r\nsomething. I am sure it will interest you very much. Only\xe2\x80\x94as it is\r\nsomething rather private\xe2\x80\x94we had better come into my little studio. I\r\nhave a western window; we can still see the sunset. _Andiamo!_\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\ngave a little pat to his companion\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\nHe led the way in; Mr. Brand stiffly and softly followed. The twilight\r\nhad thickened in the little studio; but the wall opposite the western\r\nwindow was covered with a deep pink flush. There were a great many\r\nsketches and half-finished canvasses suspended in this rosy glow, and\r\nthe corners of the room were vague and dusky. Felix begged Mr. Brand to\r\nsit down; then glancing round him, \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, how pretty it looks!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. But Mr. Brand would not sit down; he went and leaned against the\r\nwindow; he wondered what Felix wanted of him. In the shadow, on the\r\ndarker parts of the wall, he saw the gleam of three or four pictures\r\nthat looked fantastic and surprising. They seemed to represent naked\r\nfigures. Felix stood there, with his head a little bent and his eyes\r\nfixed upon his visitor, smiling intensely, pulling his moustache. Mr.\r\nBrand felt vaguely uneasy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very delicate\xe2\x80\x94what I want to say,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFelix began. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have been thinking of it for some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to say it as quickly as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because you are a clergyman, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I should venture to say it to a common man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand was silent a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is a question of yielding to a\r\nweakness, of resenting an injury, I am afraid I am a very common man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest friend,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not an injury; it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbenefit\xe2\x80\x94a great service! You will like it extremely. Only it\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ndelicate!\xe2\x80\x9d And, in the dim light, he continued to smile intensely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow I take a great interest in my cousins\xe2\x80\x94in Charlotte and Gertrude\r\nWentworth. That\xe2\x80\x99s very evident from my having traveled some five\r\nthousand miles to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand said nothing and Felix\r\nproceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cComing into their society as a perfect stranger I received\r\nof course a great many new impressions, and my impressions had a great\r\nfreshness, a great keenness. Do you know what I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure that I do; but I should like you to continue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think my impressions have always a good deal of freshness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBrand\xe2\x80\x99s entertainer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut on this occasion it was perhaps particularly\r\nnatural that\xe2\x80\x94coming in, as I say, from outside\xe2\x80\x94I should be struck with\r\nthings that passed unnoticed among yourselves. And then I had my sister\r\nto help me; and she is simply the most observant woman in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in our little circle two\r\nintelligent persons should have found food for observation. I am sure\r\nthat, of late, I have found it myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but I shall surprise you yet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth my\r\nsister and I took a great fancy to my cousin Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cousin Charlotte?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Brand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe fell in love with her from the first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fell in love with Charlotte?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dame!_\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a very charming person; and Eugenia\r\nwas especially smitten.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand stood staring, and he pursued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffection, you know, opens one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and we noticed something.\r\nCharlotte is not happy! Charlotte is in love.\xe2\x80\x9d And Felix, drawing\r\nnearer, laid his hand again upon his companion\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\nThere was something akin to an acknowledgment of fascination in the way\r\nMr. Brand looked at him; but the young clergyman retained as yet quite\r\nenough self-possession to be able to say, with a good deal of\r\nsolemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is not in love with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix gave a light laugh, and rejoined with the alacrity of a maritime\r\nadventurer who feels a puff of wind in his sail. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, no; if she were\r\nin love with me I should know it! I am not so blind as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, you are stone blind. Poor Charlotte is dead in love with\r\n_you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand said nothing for a moment; he breathed a little heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthat what you wanted to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have wanted to say it these three weeks. Because of late she has\r\nbeen worse. I told you,\xe2\x80\x9d added Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cit was very delicate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Brand began; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sure you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you see\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nsoon as I mention it\xe2\x80\x94how everything is explained?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand answered\r\nnothing; he looked for a chair and softly sat down. Felix could see\r\nthat he was blushing; he had looked straight at his host hitherto, but\r\nnow he looked away. The foremost effect of what he had heard had been a\r\nsort of irritation of his modesty. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cI suggest\r\nnothing; it would be very presumptuous in me to advise you. But I think\r\nthere is no doubt about the fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand looked hard at the floor for some moments; he was oppressed\r\nwith a mixture of sensations. Felix, standing there, was very sure that\r\none of them was profound surprise. The innocent young man had been\r\ncompletely unsuspicious of poor Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s hidden flame. This gave\r\nFelix great hope; he was sure that Mr. Brand would be flattered. Felix\r\nthought him very transparent, and indeed he was so; he could neither\r\nsimulate nor dissimulate. \xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely know what to make of this,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid at last, without looking up; and Felix was struck with the fact\r\nthat he offered no protest or contradiction. Evidently Felix had\r\nkindled a train of memories\xe2\x80\x94a retrospective illumination. It was\r\nmaking, to Mr. Brand\xe2\x80\x99s astonished eyes, a very pretty blaze; his second\r\nemotion had been a gratification of vanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank me for telling you,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing to\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let her languish!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix murmured, lightly and softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _do_ advise me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr. Brand looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, smiling. He had thought at first his\r\nvisitor was simply appealing; but he saw he was a little ironical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in your interest; you have interfered with me,\xe2\x80\x9d the young\r\nclergyman went on.\r\n\r\nFelix still stood and smiled. The little room had grown darker, and the\r\ncrimson glow had faded; but Mr. Brand could see the brilliant\r\nexpression of his face. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend not to know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Felix at last. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have not really interfered with you. Of what\r\nyou had to lose\xe2\x80\x94with another person\xe2\x80\x94you have lost nothing. And think\r\nwhat you have gained!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me I am the proper judge, on each side,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand\r\ndeclared. He got up, holding the brim of his hat against his mouth and\r\nstaring at Felix through the dusk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have lost an illusion!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call an illusion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe belief that you really know\xe2\x80\x94that you have ever really\r\nknown\xe2\x80\x94Gertrude Wentworth. Depend upon that,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow her yet; but I have no illusions; I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand kept gazing, over his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has always been a lucid,\r\nlimpid nature,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has always been a dormant nature. She was waiting for a\r\ntouchstone. But now she is beginning to awaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t praise her to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand, with a little quaver in his\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have the advantage of me that is not generous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, I am melting with generosity!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am\r\nnot praising my cousin. I am simply attempting a scientific definition\r\nof her. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for abstractions. Now I think the contrary is\r\nwhat you have always fancied\xe2\x80\x94is the basis on which you have been\r\nbuilding. She is extremely preoccupied with the concrete. I care for\r\nthe concrete, too. But Gertrude is stronger than I; she whirls me\r\nalong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand looked for a moment into the crown of his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a most\r\ninteresting nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it pulls\xe2\x80\x94it pulls\xe2\x80\x94like a runaway horse.\r\nNow I like the feeling of a runaway horse; and if I am thrown out of\r\nthe vehicle it is no great matter. But if _you_ should be thrown, Mr.\r\nBrand\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Felix paused a moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9canother person also would suffer from\r\nthe accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat other person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlotte Wentworth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand looked at Felix for a moment sidewise, mistrustfully; then\r\nhis eyes slowly wandered over the ceiling. Felix was sure he was\r\nsecretly struck with the romance of the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this is\r\nnone of our business,\xe2\x80\x9d the young minister murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of mine, perhaps; but surely yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand lingered still, looking at the ceiling; there was evidently\r\nsomething he wanted to say. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by Miss Gertrude being\r\nstrong?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix meditatively, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean that she has had a great deal\r\nof self-possession. She was waiting\xe2\x80\x94for years; even when she seemed,\r\nperhaps, to be living in the present. She knew how to wait; she had a\r\npurpose. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean by her being strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you mean by her purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94the purpose to see the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand eyed his strange informant askance again; but he said\r\nnothing. At last he turned away, as if to take leave. He seemed\r\nbewildered, however; for instead of going to the door he moved toward\r\nthe opposite corner of the room. Felix stood and watched him for a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94almost groping about in the dusk; then he led him to the door,\r\nwith a tender, almost fraternal movement. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that all you have to\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Brand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94but it will bear a good deal of thinking of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix went with him to the garden-gate, and watched him slowly walk\r\naway into the thickening twilight with a relaxed rigidity that tried to\r\nrectify itself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is offended, excited, bewildered, perplexed\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nenchanted!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a capital mixture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nSince that visit paid by the Baroness M\xc3\xbcnster to Mrs. Acton, of which\r\nsome account was given at an earlier stage of this narrative, the\r\nintercourse between these two ladies had been neither frequent nor\r\nintimate. It was not that Mrs. Acton had failed to appreciate Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s charms; on the contrary, her perception of the graces of\r\nmanner and conversation of her brilliant visitor had been only too\r\nacute. Mrs. Acton was, as they said in Boston, very \xe2\x80\x9cintense,\xe2\x80\x9d and her\r\nimpressions were apt to be too many for her. The state of her health\r\nrequired the restriction of emotion; and this is why, receiving, as she\r\nsat in her eternal arm-chair, very few visitors, even of the soberest\r\nlocal type, she had been obliged to limit the number of her interviews\r\nwith a lady whose costume and manner recalled to her imagination\xe2\x80\x94Mrs.\r\nActon\xe2\x80\x99s imagination was a marvel\xe2\x80\x94all that she had ever read of the most\r\nstirring historical periods. But she had sent the Baroness a great many\r\nquaintly-worded messages and a great many nosegays from her garden and\r\nbaskets of beautiful fruit. Felix had eaten the fruit, and the Baroness\r\nhad arranged the flowers and returned the baskets and the messages. On\r\nthe day that followed that rainy Sunday of which mention has been made,\r\nEugenia determined to go and pay the beneficent invalid a _\xe2\x80\x9cvisite\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99adieux\xe2\x80\x9d_; so it was that, to herself, she qualified her enterprise.\r\nIt may be noted that neither on the Sunday evening nor on the Monday\r\nmorning had she received that expected visit from Robert Acton. To his\r\nown consciousness, evidently he was \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping away;\xe2\x80\x9d and as the\r\nBaroness, on her side, was keeping away from her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, whither, for\r\nseveral days, Felix had been the unembarrassed bearer of apologies and\r\nregrets for absence, chance had not taken the cards from the hands of\r\ndesign. Mr. Wentworth and his daughters had respected Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseclusion; certain intervals of mysterious retirement appeared to them,\r\nvaguely, a natural part of the graceful, rhythmic movement of so\r\nremarkable a life. Gertrude especially held these periods in honor; she\r\nwondered what Madame M\xc3\xbcnster did at such times, but she would not have\r\npermitted herself to inquire too curiously.\r\n\r\nThe long rain had freshened the air, and twelve hours\xe2\x80\x99 brilliant\r\nsunshine had dried the roads; so that the Baroness, in the late\r\nafternoon, proposing to walk to Mrs. Acton\xe2\x80\x99s, exposed herself to no\r\ngreat discomfort. As with her charming undulating step she moved along\r\nthe clean, grassy margin of the road, beneath the thickly-hanging\r\nboughs of the orchards, through the quiet of the hour and place and the\r\nrich maturity of the summer, she was even conscious of a sort of\r\nluxurious melancholy. The Baroness had the amiable weakness of\r\nattaching herself to places\xe2\x80\x94even when she had begun with a little\r\naversion; and now, with the prospect of departure, she felt tenderly\r\ntoward this well-wooded corner of the Western world, where the sunsets\r\nwere so beautiful and one\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions were so pure. Mrs. Acton was able\r\nto receive her; but on entering this lady\xe2\x80\x99s large, freshly-scented room\r\nthe Baroness saw that she was looking very ill. She was wonderfully\r\nwhite and transparent, and, in her flowered arm-chair, she made no\r\nattempt to move. But she flushed a little\xe2\x80\x94like a young girl, the\r\nBaroness thought\xe2\x80\x94and she rested her clear, smiling eyes upon those of\r\nher visitor. Her voice was low and monotonous, like a voice that had\r\nnever expressed any human passions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to bid you good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon be going\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you going away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon\xe2\x80\x94any day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cI hoped you would stay\xe2\x80\x94always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways?\xe2\x80\x9d Eugenia demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Acton, in her sweet, feeble tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey tell me you are so comfortable\xe2\x80\x94that you have got such a beautiful\r\nlittle house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia stared\xe2\x80\x94that is, she smiled; she thought of her poor little\r\nchalet and she wondered whether her hostess were jesting. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my\r\nhouse is exquisite,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthough not to be compared to yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my son is so fond of going to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Acton added. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nafraid my son will miss you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia, with a little laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay in\r\nAmerica for your son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you like America?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness looked at the front of her dress. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I liked it\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwould not be staying for your son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Acton gazed at her with her grave, tender eyes, as if she had not\r\nquite understood. The Baroness at last found something irritating in\r\nthe sweet, soft stare of her hostess; and if one were not bound to be\r\nmerciful to great invalids she would almost have taken the liberty of\r\npronouncing her, mentally, a fool. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, then, I shall never\r\nsee you again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Acton. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I am dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear madam,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Eugenia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to leave my children cheerful and happy. My daughter will\r\nprobably marry her cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo such interesting young people,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, vaguely. She\r\nwas not thinking of Clifford Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel so tranquil about my end,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Acton went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is coming so\r\neasily, so surely.\xe2\x80\x9d And she paused, with her mild gaze always on\r\nEugenia\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness hated to be reminded of death; but even in its imminence,\r\nso far as Mrs. Acton was concerned, she preserved her good manners.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, madam, you are too charming an invalid,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined.\r\n\r\nBut the delicacy of this rejoinder was apparently lost upon her\r\nhostess, who went on in her low, reasonable voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to leave my\r\nchildren bright and comfortable. You seem to me all so happy here\xe2\x80\x94just\r\nas you are. So I wish you could stay. It would be so pleasant for\r\nRobert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia wondered what she meant by its being pleasant for Robert; but\r\nshe felt that she would never know what such a woman as that meant. She\r\ngot up; she was afraid Mrs. Acton would tell her again that she was\r\ndying. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, dear madam,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must remember that your\r\nstrength is precious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Acton took her hand and held it a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _have_ been\r\nhappy here, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you? And you like us all, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? I wish you\r\nwould stay,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cin your beautiful little house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had told Eugenia that her waiting-woman would be in the hall, to\r\nshow her downstairs; but the large landing outside her door was empty,\r\nand Eugenia stood there looking about. She felt irritated; the dying\r\nlady had not _\xe2\x80\x9cla main heureuse.\xe2\x80\x9d_ She passed slowly downstairs, still\r\nlooking about. The broad staircase made a great bend, and in the angle\r\nwas a high window, looking westward, with a deep bench, covered with a\r\nrow of flowering plants in curious old pots of blue china-ware. The\r\nyellow afternoon light came in through the flowers and flickered a\r\nlittle on the white wainscots. Eugenia paused a moment; the house was\r\nperfectly still, save for the ticking, somewhere, of a great clock. The\r\nlower hall stretched away at the foot of the stairs, half covered over\r\nwith a large Oriental rug. Eugenia lingered a little, noticing a great\r\nmany things. _\xe2\x80\x9cComme c\xe2\x80\x99est bien!\xe2\x80\x9d_ she said to herself; such a large,\r\nsolid, irreproachable basis of existence the place seemed to her to\r\nindicate. And then she reflected that Mrs. Acton was soon to withdraw\r\nfrom it. The reflection accompanied her the rest of the way downstairs,\r\nwhere she paused again, making more observations. The hall was\r\nextremely broad, and on either side of the front door was a wide,\r\ndeeply-set window, which threw the shadows of everything back into the\r\nhouse. There were high-backed chairs along the wall and big Eastern\r\nvases upon tables, and, on either side, a large cabinet with a glass\r\nfront and little curiosities within, dimly gleaming. The doors were\r\nopen\xe2\x80\x94into the darkened parlor, the library, the dining-room. All these\r\nrooms seemed empty. Eugenia passed along, and stopped a moment on the\r\nthreshold of each. _\xe2\x80\x9cComme c\xe2\x80\x99est bien!\xe2\x80\x9d_ she murmured again; she had\r\nthought of just such a house as this when she decided to come to\r\nAmerica. She opened the front door for herself\xe2\x80\x94her light tread had\r\nsummoned none of the servants\xe2\x80\x94and on the threshold she gave a last\r\nlook. Outside, she was still in the humor for curious contemplation; so\r\ninstead of going directly down the little drive, to the gate, she\r\nwandered away towards the garden, which lay to the right of the house.\r\nShe had not gone many yards over the grass before she paused quickly;\r\nshe perceived a gentleman stretched upon the level verdure, beneath a\r\ntree. He had not heard her coming, and he lay motionless, flat on his\r\nback, with his hands clasped under his head, staring up at the sky; so\r\nthat the Baroness was able to reflect, at her leisure, upon the\r\nquestion of his identity. It was that of a person who had lately been\r\nmuch in her thoughts; but her first impulse, nevertheless, was to turn\r\naway; the last thing she desired was to have the air of coming in quest\r\nof Robert Acton. The gentleman on the grass, however, gave her no time\r\nto decide; he could not long remain unconscious of so agreeable a\r\npresence. He rolled back his eyes, stared, gave an exclamation, and\r\nthen jumped up. He stood an instant, looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my ridiculous position,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just now no sense of the ridiculous. But, in case you have,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I came to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Acton, \xe2\x80\x9chow you put it into my head! I was\r\nthinking of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe occupation of extreme leisure!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think of a\r\nwoman when you are in that position is no compliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say I was thinking well!\xe2\x80\x9d Acton affirmed, smiling.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, and then she turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cremember at least that I\r\nam within your gates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted\xe2\x80\x94I am honored! Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come into the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just come out of it. I have been calling upon your mother. I\r\nhave been bidding her farewell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell?\xe2\x80\x9d Acton demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going away,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. And she turned away again, as if\r\nto illustrate her meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Acton, standing a moment in his place. But\r\nthe Baroness made no answer, and he followed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came this way to look at your garden,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, walking back to the\r\ngate, over the grass. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me at least go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d He went with her, and they said nothing\r\ntill they reached the gate. It was open, and they looked down the road\r\nwhich was darkened over with long bosky shadows. \xe2\x80\x9cMust you go straight\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x9d Acton asked.\r\n\r\nBut she made no answer. She said, after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you not\r\nbeen to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d He said nothing, and then she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nanswer me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am trying to invent an answer,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you none ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone that I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut let me walk with you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may do as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved slowly along the road, and Acton went with her. Presently he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had done as I liked I would have come to see you several\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that invented?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Eugenia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is natural. I stayed away because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here comes the reason, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wanted to think about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you wanted to lie down!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen you\r\nlie down\xe2\x80\x94almost\xe2\x80\x94in my drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon stopped in the road, with a movement which seemed to beg her to\r\nlinger a little. She paused, and he looked at her awhile; he thought\r\nher very charming. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are jesting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you are really\r\ngoing away it is very serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I stay,\xe2\x80\x9d and she gave a little laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cit is more serious still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we all admire you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not a reason. I am admired also in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d And she began to\r\nwalk homeward again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could I say to keep you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Acton. He wanted to keep her, and\r\nit was a fact that he had been thinking of her for a week. He was in\r\nlove with her now; he was conscious of that, or he thought he was; and\r\nthe only question with him was whether he could trust her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you can say to keep me?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I want very much to go\r\nit is not in my interest to tell you. Besides, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on with her in silence; he was much more affected by what she\r\nhad told him than appeared. Ever since that evening of his return from\r\nNewport her image had had a terrible power to trouble him. What\r\nClifford Wentworth had told him\xe2\x80\x94that had affected him, too, in an\r\nadverse sense; but it had not liberated him from the discomfort of a\r\ncharm of which his intelligence was impatient. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is not honest, she\r\nis not honest,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept murmuring to himself. That is what he had been\r\nsaying to the summer sky, ten minutes before. Unfortunately, he was\r\nunable to say it finally, definitively; and now that he was near her it\r\nseemed to matter wonderfully little. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a woman who will lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nhad said to himself. Now, as he went along, he reminded himself of this\r\nobservation; but it failed to frighten him as it had done before. He\r\nalmost wished he could make her lie and then convict her of it, so that\r\nhe might see how he should like that. He kept thinking of this as he\r\nwalked by her side, while she moved forward with her light, graceful\r\ndignity. He had sat with her before; he had driven with her; but he had\r\nnever walked with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, how _comme il faut_ she is!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he observed her\r\nsidewise. When they reached the cottage in the orchard she passed into\r\nthe gate without asking him to follow; but she turned round, as he\r\nstood there, to bid him good-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked you a question the other night which you never answered,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you sent off that document\xe2\x80\x94liberating yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a single moment\xe2\x80\x94very naturally. Then, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, simply.\r\n\r\nHe turned away; he wondered whether that would do for his lie. But he\r\nsaw her again that evening, for the Baroness reappeared at her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHe had little talk with her, however; two gentlemen had driven out from\r\nBoston, in a buggy, to call upon Mr. Wentworth and his daughters, and\r\nMadame M\xc3\xbcnster was an object of absorbing interest to both of the\r\nvisitors. One of them, indeed, said nothing to her; he only sat and\r\nwatched with intense gravity, and leaned forward solemnly, presenting\r\nhis ear (a very large one), as if he were deaf, whenever she dropped an\r\nobservation. He had evidently been impressed with the idea of her\r\nmisfortunes and reverses: he never smiled. His companion adopted a\r\nlighter, easier style; sat as near as possible to Madame M\xc3\xbcnster;\r\nattempted to draw her out, and proposed every few moments a new topic\r\nof conversation. Eugenia was less vividly responsive than usual and had\r\nless to say than, from her brilliant reputation, her interlocutor\r\nexpected, upon the relative merits of European and American\r\ninstitutions; but she was inaccessible to Robert Acton, who roamed\r\nabout the piazza with his hands in his pockets, listening for the\r\ngrating sound of the buggy from Boston, as it should be brought round\r\nto the side-door. But he listened in vain, and at last he lost\r\npatience. His sister came to him and begged him to take her home, and\r\nhe presently went off with her. Eugenia observed him leaving the house\r\nwith Lizzie; in her present mood the fact seemed a contribution to her\r\nirritated conviction that he had several precious qualities. \xe2\x80\x9cEven that\r\n_mal-\xc3\xa9lev\xc3\xa9e_ little girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes him do what she\r\nwishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had been sitting just within one of the long windows that opened\r\nupon the piazza; but very soon after Acton had gone away she got up\r\nabruptly, just when the talkative gentleman from Boston was asking her\r\nwhat she thought of the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral tone\xe2\x80\x9d of that city. On the piazza she\r\nencountered Clifford Wentworth, coming round from the other side of the\r\nhouse. She stopped him; she told him she wished to speak to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you go home with your cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nClifford stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Robert has taken her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t usually leave that to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see those fellows start off. They don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how to drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not, then, that you have quarreled with your cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClifford reflected a moment, and then with a simplicity which had, for\r\nthe Baroness, a singularly baffling quality, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; we have made up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for some moments; but Clifford had begun to be afraid\r\nof the Baroness\xe2\x80\x99s looks, and he endeavored, now, to shift himself out\r\nof their range. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you never come to see me any more?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I displeased you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDispleased me? Well, I guess not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy haven\xe2\x80\x99t you come, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, because I am afraid of getting shut up in that back room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEugenia kept looking at him. \xe2\x80\x9cI should think you would like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should, if I were a young man calling upon a charming woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA charming woman isn\xe2\x80\x99t much use to me when I am shut up in that back\r\nroom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I am not of much use to you anywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame\r\nM\xc3\xbcnster. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you know how I have offered to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Clifford, by way of response, \xe2\x80\x9cthere comes the buggy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the buggy. Do you know I am going away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean in a few days. I leave this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going back to Europe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Europe, where you are to come and see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come out there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut before that,\xe2\x80\x9d Eugenia declared, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must come and see me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall keep clear of that back room!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined her simple young\r\nkinsman.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness was silent a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you must come frankly\xe2\x80\x94boldly.\r\nThat will be very much better. I see that now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clifford. And then, in an instant, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter\r\nwith that buggy?\xe2\x80\x9d His practiced ear had apparently detected an\r\nunnatural creak in the wheels of the light vehicle which had been\r\nbrought to the portico, and he hurried away to investigate so grave an\r\nanomaly.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness walked homeward, alone, in the starlight, asking herself a\r\nquestion. Was she to have gained nothing\xe2\x80\x94was she to have gained\r\nnothing?\r\n\r\nGertrude Wentworth had held a silent place in the little circle\r\ngathered about the two gentlemen from Boston. She was not interested in\r\nthe visitors; she was watching Madame M\xc3\xbcnster, as she constantly\r\nwatched her. She knew that Eugenia also was not interested\xe2\x80\x94that she was\r\nbored; and Gertrude was absorbed in study of the problem how, in spite\r\nof her indifference and her absent attention, she managed to have such\r\na charming manner. That was the manner Gertrude would have liked to\r\nhave; she determined to cultivate it, and she wished that\xe2\x80\x94to give her\r\nthe charm\xe2\x80\x94she might in future very often be bored. While she was\r\nengaged in these researches, Felix Young was looking for Charlotte, to\r\nwhom he had something to say. For some time, now, he had had something\r\nto say to Charlotte, and this evening his sense of the propriety of\r\nholding some special conversation with her had reached the\r\nmotive-point\xe2\x80\x94resolved itself into acute and delightful desire. He\r\nwandered through the empty rooms on the large ground-floor of the\r\nhouse, and found her at last in a small apartment denominated, for\r\nreasons not immediately apparent, Mr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coffice:\xe2\x80\x9d an\r\nextremely neat and well-dusted room, with an array of law-books, in\r\ntime-darkened sheep-skin, on one of the walls; a large map of the\r\nUnited States on the other, flanked on either side by an old steel\r\nengraving of one of Raphael\xe2\x80\x99s Madonnas; and on the third several glass\r\ncases containing specimens of butterflies and beetles. Charlotte was\r\nsitting by a lamp, embroidering a slipper. Felix did not ask for whom\r\nthe slipper was destined; he saw it was very large.\r\n\r\nHe moved a chair toward her and sat down, smiling as usual, but, at\r\nfirst, not speaking. She watched him, with her needle poised, and with\r\na certain shy, fluttered look which she always wore when he approached\r\nher. There was something in Felix\xe2\x80\x99s manner that quickened her modesty,\r\nher self-consciousness; if absolute choice had been given her she would\r\nhave preferred never to find herself alone with him; and in fact,\r\nthough she thought him a most brilliant, distinguished, and\r\nwell-meaning person, she had exercised a much larger amount of\r\ntremulous tact than he had ever suspected, to circumvent the accident\r\nof _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_. Poor Charlotte could have given no account of the\r\nmatter that would not have seemed unjust both to herself and to her\r\nforeign kinsman; she could only have said\xe2\x80\x94or rather, she would never\r\nhave said it\xe2\x80\x94that she did not like so much gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s society at once.\r\nShe was not reassured, accordingly, when he began, emphasizing his\r\nwords with a kind of admiring radiance, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear cousin, I am enchanted\r\nat finding you alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very often alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte observed. Then she quickly added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean I am lonely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo clever a woman as you is never lonely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\ncompany in your beautiful work.\xe2\x80\x9d And he glanced at the big slipper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to work,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Charlotte, simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I!\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I like to idle too. But it is not\r\nto idle that I have come in search of you. I want to tell you something\r\nvery particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Charlotte; \xe2\x80\x9cof course, if you must\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that a young lady may not\r\nlisten to. At least I suppose it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. But _voyons_; you shall judge.\r\nI am terribly in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Felix,\xe2\x80\x9d began Miss Wentworth, gravely. But her very gravity\r\nappeared to check the development of her phrase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in love with your sister; but in love, Charlotte\xe2\x80\x94in love!\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nyoung man pursued. Charlotte had laid her work in her lap; her hands\r\nwere tightly folded on top of it; she was staring at the carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nshort, I\xe2\x80\x99m in love, dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I want you to help\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo help you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Charlotte, with a tremor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean with Gertrude; she and I have a perfect understanding;\r\nand oh, how well she understands one! I mean with your father and with\r\nthe world in general, including Mr. Brand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mr. Brand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, slowly, but with a simplicity which\r\nmade it evident to Felix that the young minister had not repeated to\r\nMiss Wentworth the talk that had lately occurred between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now, don\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98poor\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Brand! I don\xe2\x80\x99t pity Mr. Brand at all.\r\nBut I pity your father a little, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to displease him.\r\nTherefore, you see, I want you to plead for me. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think me very\r\nshabby, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShabby?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Charlotte softly, for whom Felix represented the\r\nmost polished and iridescent qualities of mankind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean in my appearance,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Felix, laughing; for\r\nCharlotte was looking at his boots. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean in my conduct. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s an abuse of hospitality?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo\xe2\x80\x94to care for Gertrude?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have really expressed one\xe2\x80\x99s self. Because I _have_ expressed\r\nmyself, Charlotte; I must tell you the whole truth\xe2\x80\x94I have! Of course I\r\nwant to marry her\xe2\x80\x94and here is the difficulty. I held off as long as I\r\ncould; but she is such a terribly fascinating person! She\xe2\x80\x99s a strange\r\ncreature, Charlotte; I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you really know her.\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte\r\ntook up her tapestry again, and again she laid it down. \xe2\x80\x9cI know your\r\nfather has had higher views,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix continued; \xe2\x80\x9cand I think you have\r\nshared them. You have wanted to marry her to Mr. Brand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, very earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brand has always admired\r\nher. But we did not want anything of that kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix stared. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely, marriage was what you proposed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to force her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_A la bonne heure!_ That\xe2\x80\x99s very unsafe you know. With these arranged\r\nmarriages there is often the deuce to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Felix,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x9cwe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to \xe2\x80\x98arrange.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted to hear that. Because in such cases\xe2\x80\x94even when the woman\r\nis a thoroughly good creature\xe2\x80\x94she can\xe2\x80\x99t help looking for a\r\ncompensation. A charming fellow comes along\xe2\x80\x94and _voil\xc3\xa0!_\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte sat\r\nmutely staring at the floor, and Felix presently added, \xe2\x80\x9cDo go on with\r\nyour slipper, I like to see you work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte took up her variegated canvas, and began to draw vague blue\r\nstitches in a big round rose. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Gertrude is so\xe2\x80\x94so strange,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you want to marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, dear Charlotte! I like strange women; I always have\r\nliked them. Ask Eugenia! And Gertrude is wonderful; she says the most\r\nbeautiful things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte looked at him, almost for the first time, as if her meaning\r\nrequired to be severely pointed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a great influence over her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94and no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cI had at first, I think; but now it is six\r\nof one and half-a-dozen of the other; it is reciprocal. She affects me\r\nstrongly\xe2\x80\x94for she _is_ so strong. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you know her; it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbeautiful nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, Felix; I have always thought Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s nature beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you think so now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cwait and see! She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na folded flower. Let me pluck her from the parent tree and you will see\r\nher expand. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x9cI _can\xe2\x80\x99t_, Felix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can understand this\xe2\x80\x94that I beg you to say a good word for me\r\nto your father. He regards me, I naturally believe, as a very light\r\nfellow, a Bohemian, an irregular character. Tell him I am not all this;\r\nif I ever was, I have forgotten it. I am fond of pleasure\xe2\x80\x94yes; but of\r\ninnocent pleasure. Pain is all one; but in pleasure, you know, there\r\nare tremendous distinctions. Say to him that Gertrude is a folded\r\nflower and that I am a serious man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte got up from her chair slowly rolling up her work. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know\r\nyou are very kind to everyone, Felix,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we are extremely\r\nsorry for Mr. Brand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you are\xe2\x80\x94you especially! Because,\xe2\x80\x9d added Felix hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nare a woman. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t pity him. It ought to be enough for any man\r\nthat you take an interest in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not enough for Mr. Brand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, simply. And she stood\r\nthere a moment, as if waiting conscientiously for anything more that\r\nFelix might have to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brand is not so keen about his marriage as he was,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is afraid of your sister. He begins to think she is wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte looked at him now with beautiful, appealing eyes\xe2\x80\x94eyes into\r\nwhich he saw the tears rising. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Felix, Felix,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nhave you done to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she was asleep; I have waked her up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Charlotte, apparently, was really crying, she walked straight out\r\nof the room. And Felix, standing there and meditating, had the apparent\r\nbrutality to take satisfaction in her tears.\r\n\r\nLate that night Gertrude, silent and serious, came to him in the\r\ngarden; it was a kind of appointment. Gertrude seemed to like\r\nappointments. She plucked a handful of heliotrope and stuck it into the\r\nfront of her dress, but she said nothing. They walked together along\r\none of the paths, and Felix looked at the great, square, hospitable\r\nhouse, massing itself vaguely in the starlight, with all its windows\r\ndarkened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a little of a bad conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to meet you\r\nthis way till I have got your father\xe2\x80\x99s consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at him for some time. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou very often say that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cConsidering how little we\r\nunderstand each other, it is a wonder how well we get on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have done nothing but meet since you came here\xe2\x80\x94but meet alone. The\r\nfirst time I ever saw you we were alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\r\nthe difference now? Is it because it is at night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difference, Gertrude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, stopping in the path, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ndifference is that I love you more\xe2\x80\x94more than before!\xe2\x80\x9d And then they\r\nstood there, talking, in the warm stillness and in front of the closed\r\ndark house. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been talking to Charlotte\xe2\x80\x94been trying to bespeak\r\nher interest with your father. She has a kind of sublime perversity;\r\nwas ever a woman so bent upon cutting off her own head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too careful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are too diplomatic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here to make anyone\r\nunhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked round her awhile in the odorous darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cI will do\r\nanything you please,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor instance?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felix, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go away. I will do anything you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix looked at her in solemn admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we will go away,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we will make peace first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked about her again, and then she broke out, passionately,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do they try to make one feel guilty? Why do they make it so\r\ndifficult? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t they understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will make them understand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. He drew her hand into his\r\narm, and they wandered about in the garden, talking, for an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nFelix allowed Charlotte time to plead his cause; and then, on the third\r\nday, he sought an interview with his uncle. It was in the morning; Mr.\r\nWentworth was in his office; and, on going in, Felix found that\r\nCharlotte was at that moment in conference with her father. She had, in\r\nfact, been constantly near him since her interview with Felix; she had\r\nmade up her mind that it was her duty to repeat very literally her\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s passionate plea. She had accordingly followed Mr. Wentworth\r\nabout like a shadow, in order to find him at hand when she should have\r\nmustered sufficient composure to speak. For poor Charlotte, in this\r\nmatter, naturally lacked composure; especially when she meditated upon\r\nsome of Felix\xe2\x80\x99s intimations. It was not cheerful work, at the best, to\r\nkeep giving small hammer-taps to the coffin in which one had laid away,\r\nfor burial, the poor little unacknowledged offspring of one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nmisbehaving heart; and the occupation was not rendered more agreeable\r\nby the fact that the ghost of one\xe2\x80\x99s stifled dream had been summoned\r\nfrom the shades by the strange, bold words of a talkative young\r\nforeigner. What had Felix meant by saying that Mr. Brand was not so\r\nkeen? To herself her sister\xe2\x80\x99s justly depressed suitor had shown no sign\r\nof faltering. Charlotte trembled all over when she allowed herself to\r\nbelieve for an instant now and then that, privately, Mr. Brand might\r\nhave faltered; and as it seemed to give more force to Felix\xe2\x80\x99s words to\r\nrepeat them to her father, she was waiting until she should have taught\r\nherself to be very calm. But she had now begun to tell Mr. Wentworth\r\nthat she was extremely anxious. She was proceeding to develop this\r\nidea, to enumerate the objects of her anxiety, when Felix came in.\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth sat there, with his legs crossed, lifting his dry, pure\r\ncountenance from the Boston _Advertiser_. Felix entered smiling, as if\r\nhe had something particular to say, and his uncle looked at him as if\r\nhe both expected and deprecated this event. Felix vividly expressing\r\nhimself had come to be a formidable figure to his uncle, who had not\r\nyet arrived at definite views as to a proper tone. For the first time\r\nin his life, as I have said, Mr. Wentworth shirked a responsibility; he\r\nearnestly desired that it might not be laid upon him to determine how\r\nhis nephew\xe2\x80\x99s lighter propositions should be treated. He lived under an\r\napprehension that Felix might yet beguile him into assent to doubtful\r\ninductions, and his conscience instructed him that the best form of\r\nvigilance was the avoidance of discussion. He hoped that the pleasant\r\nepisode of his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s visit would pass away without a further lapse\r\nof consistency.\r\n\r\nFelix looked at Charlotte with an air of understanding, and then at Mr.\r\nWentworth, and then at Charlotte again. Mr. Wentworth bent his refined\r\neyebrows upon his nephew and stroked down the first page of the\r\n_Advertiser_. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have brought a bouquet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix,\r\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIn France they always do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not in France,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Wentworth, gravely, while\r\nCharlotte earnestly gazed at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, luckily, we are not in France, where I am afraid I should have a\r\nharder time of it. My dear Charlotte, have you rendered me that\r\ndelightful service?\xe2\x80\x9d And Felix bent toward her as if someone had been\r\npresenting him.\r\n\r\nCharlotte looked at him with almost frightened eyes; and Mr. Wentworth\r\nthought this might be the beginning of a discussion. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the\r\nbouquet for?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, by way of turning it off.\r\n\r\nFelix gazed at him, smiling. _\xe2\x80\x9cPour la demande!\xe2\x80\x9d_ And then, drawing up\r\na chair, he seated himself, hat in hand, with a kind of conscious\r\nsolemnity.\r\n\r\nPresently he turned to Charlotte again. \xe2\x80\x9cMy good Charlotte, my\r\nadmirable Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have not played me false\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nhave not sided against me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte got up, trembling extremely, though imperceptibly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nspeak to my father yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you are clever\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Felix, rising too, begged her to remain. \xe2\x80\x9cI can speak better to an\r\naudience!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it is nothing disagreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something delightful, for me!\xe2\x80\x9d And Felix, laying down his hat,\r\nclasped his hands a little between his knees. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desire, very earnestly, to marry your daughter Gertrude.\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte\r\nsank slowly into her chair again, and Mr. Wentworth sat staring, with a\r\nlight in his face that might have been flashed back from an iceberg. He\r\nstared and stared; he said nothing. Felix fell back, with his hands\r\nstill clasped. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. I was afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d He blushed deeply,\r\nand Charlotte noticed it\xe2\x80\x94remarking to herself that it was the first\r\ntime she had ever seen him blush. She began to blush herself and to\r\nreflect that he might be much in love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very abrupt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never suspected it, dear uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d Felix inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\r\nproves how discreet I have been. Yes, I thought you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very serious, Felix,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think it\xe2\x80\x99s an abuse of hospitality!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Felix, smiling\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf hospitality?\xe2\x80\x94an abuse?\xe2\x80\x9d his uncle repeated very slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what Felix said to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, conscientiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you think so; don\xe2\x80\x99t defend yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\n_is_ an abuse, obviously; the most I can claim is that it is perhaps a\r\npardonable one. I simply fell head over heels in love; one can hardly\r\nhelp that. Though you are Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s progenitor I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\r\nknow how attractive she is. Dear uncle, she contains the elements of a\r\nsingularly\xe2\x80\x94I may say a strangely\xe2\x80\x94charming woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has always been to me an object of extreme concern,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nWentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have always desired her happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI will make her happy. She\r\nbelieves it, too. Now hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you noticed that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had noticed that she was much changed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth declared, in a\r\ntone whose unexpressive, unimpassioned quality appeared to Felix to\r\nreveal a profundity of opposition. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that she is only becoming\r\nwhat you call a charming woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGertrude, at heart, is so earnest, so true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte, very\r\nsoftly, fastening her eyes upon her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI delight to hear you praise her!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has a very peculiar temperament,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, even that is praise!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I am not the man you\r\nmight have looked for. I have no position and no fortune; I can give\r\nGertrude no place in the world. A place in the world\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what she\r\nought to have; that would bring her out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA place to do her duty!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, how charmingly she does it\xe2\x80\x94her duty!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix exclaimed, with a\r\nradiant face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an exquisite conception she has of it! But she\r\ncomes honestly by that, dear uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte both\r\nlooked at him as if they were watching a greyhound doubling. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nwith me she will hide her light under a bushel,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI being\r\nthe bushel! Now I know you like me\xe2\x80\x94you have certainly proved it. But\r\nyou think I am frivolous and penniless and shabby! Granted\xe2\x80\x94granted\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nthousand times granted. I have been a loose fish\xe2\x80\x94a fiddler, a painter,\r\nan actor. But there is this to be said: In the first place, I fancy you\r\nexaggerate; you lend me qualities I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had. I have been a\r\nBohemian\xe2\x80\x94yes; but in Bohemia I always passed for a gentleman. I wish\r\nyou could see some of my old _camarades_\xe2\x80\x94they would tell you! It was\r\nthe liberty I liked, but not the opportunities! My sins were all\r\npeccadilloes; I always respected my neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s property\xe2\x80\x94my neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife. Do you see, dear uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth ought to have seen; his\r\ncold blue eyes were intently fixed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, _c\xe2\x80\x99est fini!_ It\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nover. _Je me range_. I have settled down to a jog-trot. I find I can\r\nearn my living\xe2\x80\x94a very fair one\xe2\x80\x94by going about the world and painting\r\nbad portraits. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a glorious profession, but it is a perfectly\r\nrespectable one. You won\xe2\x80\x99t deny that, eh? Going about the world, I say?\r\nI must not deny that, for that I am afraid I shall always do\xe2\x80\x94in quest\r\nof agreeable sitters. When I say agreeable, I mean susceptible of\r\ndelicate flattery and prompt of payment. Gertrude declares she is\r\nwilling to share my wanderings and help to pose my models. She even\r\nthinks it will be charming; and that brings me to my third point.\r\nGertrude likes me. Encourage her a little and she will tell you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix\xe2\x80\x99s tongue obviously moved much faster than the imagination of his\r\nauditors; his eloquence, like the rocking of a boat in a deep, smooth\r\nlake, made long eddies of silence. And he seemed to be pleading and\r\nchattering still, with his brightly eager smile, his uplifted eyebrows,\r\nhis expressive mouth, after he had ceased speaking, and while, with his\r\nglance quickly turning from the father to the daughter, he sat waiting\r\nfor the effect of his appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not your want of means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nWentworth, after a period of severe reticence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s delightful of you to say that! Only don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s my want of\r\ncharacter. Because I have a character\xe2\x80\x94I assure you I have; a small one,\r\na little slip of a thing, but still something tangible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOught you not to tell Felix that it is Mr. Brand, father?\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte\r\nasked, with infinite mildness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not only Mr. Brand,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth solemnly declared. And he\r\nlooked at his knee for a long time. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to explain,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. He wished, evidently, to be very just. \xe2\x80\x9cIt rests on moral\r\ngrounds, as Mr. Brand says. It is the question whether it is the best\r\nthing for Gertrude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is better\xe2\x80\x94what is better, dear uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d Felix rejoined urgently,\r\nrising in his urgency and standing before Mr. Wentworth. His uncle had\r\nbeen looking at his knee; but when Felix moved he transferred his gaze\r\nto the handle of the door which faced him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is usually a fairly good\r\nthing for a girl to marry the man she loves!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix.\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, Mr. Wentworth saw the handle of the door begin to turn;\r\nthe door opened and remained slightly ajar, until Felix had delivered\r\nhimself of the cheerful axiom just quoted. Then it opened altogether\r\nand Gertrude stood there. She looked excited; there was a spark in her\r\nsweet, dull eyes. She came in slowly, but with an air of resolution,\r\nand, closing the door softly, looked round at the three persons\r\npresent. Felix went to her with tender gallantry, holding out his hand,\r\nand Charlotte made a place for her on the sofa. But Gertrude put her\r\nhands behind her and made no motion to sit down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are talking of you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I came.\xe2\x80\x9d And she fastened her\r\neyes on her father, who returned her gaze very fixedly. In his own cold\r\nblue eyes there was a kind of pleading, reasoning light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better you should be present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\ndiscussing your future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy discuss it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, to me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave it, in the last resort, to a greater wisdom than ours,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe old man.\r\n\r\nFelix rubbed his forehead gently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut _en attendant_ the last resort,\r\nyour father lacks confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you confidence in Felix?\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude was frowning; there was\r\nsomething about her that her father and Charlotte had never seen.\r\nCharlotte got up and came to her, as if to put her arm round her; but\r\nsuddenly, she seemed afraid to touch her.\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth, however, was not afraid. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had more confidence in\r\nFelix than in you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you have never had confidence in me\xe2\x80\x94never, never! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh sister, sister!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have always needed advice,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wentworth declared. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have had\r\na difficult temperament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you call it difficult? It might have been easy, if you had\r\nallowed it. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me be natural. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\r\nwanted to make of me. Mr. Brand was the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharlotte at last took hold of her sister. She laid her two hands upon\r\nGertrude\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe cares so much for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she almost whispered.\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at her intently an instant; then kissed her. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\r\ndoes not,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen you so passionate,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Wentworth, with an\r\nair of indignation mitigated by high principles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry if I offend you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou offend me, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you are sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father, she is sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would even go further, dear uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cI would\r\nquestion whether she really offends you. How can she offend you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Wentworth made no immediate answer. Then, in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nhas not profited as we hoped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProfited? _Ah voil\xc3\xa0!_\xe2\x80\x9d Felix exclaimed.\r\n\r\nGertrude was very pale; she stood looking down. \xe2\x80\x9cI have told Felix I\r\nwould go away with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have said some admirable things!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away, sister?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway\xe2\x80\x94away; to some strange country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to frighten you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix, smiling at Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo\xe2\x80\x94what do you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gertrude, turning an instant to Felix.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Bohemia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you propose to dispense with preliminaries?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Wentworth,\r\ngetting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear uncle, _vous plaisantez!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that\r\nthese are preliminaries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude turned to her father. \xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ profited,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwanted to form my character. Well, my character is formed\xe2\x80\x94for my age. I\r\nknow what I want; I have chosen. I am determined to marry this\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better consent, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix very gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, you had better consent,\xe2\x80\x9d added a very different voice.\r\n\r\nCharlotte gave a little jump, and the others turned to the direction\r\nfrom which it had come. It was the voice of Mr. Brand, who had stepped\r\nthrough the long window which stood open to the piazza. He stood\r\npatting his forehead with his pocket-handkerchief; he was very much\r\nflushed; his face wore a singular expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, you had better consent,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand repeated, coming forward.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what Miss Gertrude means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Felix, laying his hand caressingly on the\r\nyoung minister\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand looked at him; then at Mr. Wentworth; lastly at Gertrude. He\r\ndid not look at Charlotte. But Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s earnest eyes were fastened\r\nto his own countenance; they were asking an immense question of it. The\r\nanswer to this question could not come all at once; but some of the\r\nelements of it were there. It was one of the elements of it that Mr.\r\nBrand was very red, that he held his head very high, that he had a\r\nbright, excited eye and an air of embarrassed boldness\xe2\x80\x94the air of a man\r\nwho has taken a resolve, in the execution of which he apprehends the\r\nfailure, not of his moral, but of his personal, resources. Charlotte\r\nthought he looked very grand; and it is incontestable that Mr. Brand\r\nfelt very grand. This, in fact, was the grandest moment of his life;\r\nand it was natural that such a moment should contain opportunities of\r\nawkwardness for a large, stout, modest young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, with an angular wave of his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very proper that you should be present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you are talking about,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Brand rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard what\r\nyour nephew said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he heard what you said!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Felix, patting him again on the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure that I understood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth, who had\r\nangularity in his voice as well as in his gestures.\r\n\r\nGertrude had been looking hard at her former suitor. She had been\r\npuzzled, like her sister; but her imagination moved more quickly than\r\nCharlotte\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brand asked you to let Felix take me away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nto her father.\r\n\r\nThe young minister gave her a strange look. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not because I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to see you any more,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, in a tone intended as it were\r\nfor publicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think you would want to see me any more,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude\r\nanswered, gently.\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth stood staring. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this rather a change, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr. Brand looked anywhere; only still not at Charlotte.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. And he held his handkerchief a few moments to\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are our moral grounds?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Wentworth, who had always\r\nthought Mr. Brand would be just the thing for a younger daughter with a\r\npeculiar temperament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is sometimes very moral to change, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Felix.\r\n\r\nCharlotte had softly left her sister\xe2\x80\x99s side. She had edged gently\r\ntoward her father, and now her hand found its way into his arm. Mr.\r\nWentworth had folded up the _Advertiser_ into a surprisingly small\r\ncompass, and, holding the roll with one hand, he earnestly clasped it\r\nwith the other. Mr. Brand was looking at him; and yet, though Charlotte\r\nwas so near, his eyes failed to meet her own. Gertrude watched her\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better not to speak of change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Brand. \xe2\x80\x9cIn one sense\r\nthere is no change. There was something I desired\xe2\x80\x94something I asked of\r\nyou; I desire something still\xe2\x80\x94I ask it of you.\xe2\x80\x9d And he paused a moment;\r\nMr. Wentworth looked bewildered. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like, in my ministerial\r\ncapacity, to unite this young couple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude, watching her sister, saw Charlotte flushing intensely, and\r\nMr. Wentworth felt her pressing upon his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cHeavenly Powers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Mr. Wentworth. And it was the nearest approach to profanity he\r\nhad ever made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very nice; that is very handsome!\xe2\x80\x9d Felix exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth; though it was plain that\r\neveryone else did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very beautiful, Mr. Brand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gertrude, emulating Felix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to marry you. It will give me great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs Gertrude says, it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix.\r\n\r\nFelix was smiling, but Mr. Brand was not even trying to. He himself\r\ntreated his proposition very seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI have thought of it, and I\r\nshould like to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he affirmed.\r\n\r\nCharlotte, meanwhile, was staring with expanded eyes. Her imagination,\r\nas I have said, was not so rapid as her sister\xe2\x80\x99s, but now it had taken\r\nseveral little jumps. \xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cconsent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand heard her; he looked away. Mr. Wentworth, evidently, had no\r\nimagination at all. \xe2\x80\x9cI have always thought,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nGertrude\xe2\x80\x99s character required a special line of development.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Charlotte, _\xe2\x80\x9cconsent.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThen, at last, Mr. Brand looked at her. Her father felt her leaning\r\nmore heavily upon his folded arm than she had ever done before; and\r\nthis, with a certain sweet faintness in her voice, made him wonder what\r\nwas the matter. He looked down at her and saw the encounter of her gaze\r\nwith the young theologian\xe2\x80\x99s; but even this told him nothing, and he\r\ncontinued to be bewildered. Nevertheless, \xe2\x80\x9cI consent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince Mr. Brand recommends it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to perform the ceremony very soon,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Brand,\r\nwith a sort of solemn simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, that\xe2\x80\x99s charming!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felix, profanely.\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth sank into his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless, when you understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, with a certain judicial asperity.\r\n\r\nGertrude went to her sister and led her away, and Felix having passed\r\nhis arm into Mr. Brand\xe2\x80\x99s and stepped out of the long window with him,\r\nthe old man was left sitting there in unillumined perplexity.\r\n\r\nFelix did no work that day. In the afternoon, with Gertrude, he got\r\ninto one of the boats and floated about with idly-dipping oars. They\r\ntalked a good deal of Mr. Brand\xe2\x80\x94though not exclusively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a fine stroke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was really heroic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude sat musing, with her eyes upon the ripples. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was what he\r\nwanted to be; he wanted to do something fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t be comfortable till he has married us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much\r\nthe better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to be magnanimous; he wanted to have a fine moral pleasure.\r\nI know him so well,\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude went on. Felix looked at her; she spoke\r\nslowly, gazing at the clear water. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thought of it a great deal,\r\nnight and day. He thought it would be beautiful. At last he made up his\r\nmind that it was his duty, his duty to do just that\xe2\x80\x94nothing less than\r\nthat. He felt exalted; he felt sublime. That\xe2\x80\x99s how he likes to feel. It\r\nis better for him than if I had listened to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better for me,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Felix. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do you know, as regards the\r\nsacrifice, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he admired you when this decision was\r\ntaken quite so much as he had done a fortnight before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never admired me. He admires Charlotte; he pitied me. I know him so\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t pity you so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGertrude looked at Felix a little, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t permit\r\nyourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto diminish the splendor of his action. He\r\nadmires Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s capital!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felix laughingly, and dipping his oars. I cannot\r\nsay exactly to which member of Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s phrase he alluded; but he\r\ndipped his oars again, and they kept floating about.\r\n\r\nNeither Felix nor his sister, on that day, was present at Mr.\r\nWentworth\xe2\x80\x99s at the evening repast. The two occupants of the chalet\r\ndined together, and the young man informed his companion that his\r\nmarriage was now an assured fact. Eugenia congratulated him, and\r\nreplied that if he were as reasonable a husband as he had been, on the\r\nwhole, a brother, his wife would have nothing to complain of.\r\n\r\nFelix looked at her a moment, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to be\r\nthrown back on my reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very true,\xe2\x80\x9d Eugenia rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one\xe2\x80\x99s reason is dismally\r\nflat. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bed with the mattress removed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the brother and sister, later in the evening, crossed over to the\r\nlarger house, the Baroness desiring to compliment her prospective\r\nsister-in-law. They found the usual circle upon the piazza, with the\r\nexception of Clifford Wentworth and Lizzie Acton; and as everyone stood\r\nup as usual to welcome the Baroness, Eugenia had an admiring audience\r\nfor her compliment to Gertrude.\r\n\r\nRobert Acton stood on the edge of the piazza, leaning against one of\r\nthe white columns, so that he found himself next to Eugenia while she\r\nacquitted herself of a neat little discourse of congratulation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be so glad to know you better,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen so much\r\nless of you than I should have liked. Naturally; now I see the reason\r\nwhy! You will love me a little, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I think I may say I gain on\r\nbeing known.\xe2\x80\x9d And terminating these observations with the softest\r\ncadence of her voice, the Baroness imprinted a sort of grand official\r\nkiss upon Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s forehead.\r\n\r\nIncreased familiarity had not, to Gertrude\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, diminished\r\nthe mysterious impressiveness of Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s personality, and she felt\r\nflattered and transported by this little ceremony. Robert Acton also\r\nseemed to admire it, as he admired so many of the gracious\r\nmanifestations of Madame M\xc3\xbcnster\xe2\x80\x99s wit.\r\n\r\nThey had the privilege of making him restless, and on this occasion he\r\nwalked away, suddenly, with his hands in his pockets, and then came\r\nback and leaned against his column. Eugenia was now complimenting her\r\nuncle upon his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s engagement, and Mr. Wentworth was listening\r\nwith his usual plain yet refined politeness. It is to be supposed that\r\nby this time his perception of the mutual relations of the young people\r\nwho surrounded him had become more acute; but he still took the matter\r\nvery seriously, and he was not at all exhilarated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelix will make her a good husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be a\r\ncharming companion; he has a great quality\xe2\x80\x94indestructible gaiety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think that\xe2\x80\x99s a great quality?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old man.\r\n\r\nEugenia meditated, with her eyes upon his. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think one gets tired of\r\nit, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I am prepared to say that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we will say, then, that it is tiresome for others but delightful\r\nfor one\xe2\x80\x99s self. A woman\xe2\x80\x99s husband, you know, is supposed to be her\r\nsecond self; so that, for Felix and Gertrude, gaiety will be a common\r\nproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGertrude was always very gay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wentworth. He was trying to\r\nfollow this argument.\r\n\r\nRobert Acton took his hands out of his pockets and came a little nearer\r\nto the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say you gain by being known,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\ncertainly gains by knowing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have _you_ gained?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Eugenia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn immense amount of wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a questionable advantage for a man who was already so wise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I was a great fool before I knew you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd being a fool you made my acquaintance? You are very\r\ncomplimentary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me keep it up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope, for our pleasure,\r\nthat your brother\xe2\x80\x99s marriage will detain you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I stop for my brother\xe2\x80\x99s marriage when I would not stop for\r\nmy own?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you stop in either case, now that, as you say, you have\r\ndissolved that mechanical tie that bound you to Europe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness looked at him a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I say? You look as if you\r\ndoubted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Acton, returning her glance, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a remnant of my old\r\nfolly! We have other attractions,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are to have another\r\nmarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she seemed not to hear him; she was looking at him still. \xe2\x80\x9cMy word\r\nwas never doubted before,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are to have another marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton repeated, smiling.\r\n\r\nThen she appeared to understand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked at\r\nthe others. Felix was chattering to Gertrude; Charlotte, at a distance,\r\nwas watching them; and Mr. Brand, in quite another quarter, was turning\r\nhis back to them, and, with his hands under his coat-tails and his\r\nlarge head on one side, was looking at the small, tender crescent of a\r\nyoung moon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ought to be Mr. Brand and Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must judge just now by contraries. There\r\nis more than there looks to be. I expect that combination one of these\r\ndays; but that is not what I meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, \xe2\x80\x9cI never guess my own lovers; so I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nguess other people\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon gave a loud laugh, and he was about to add a rejoinder when Mr.\r\nWentworth approached his niece. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be interested to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nold man said, with a momentary aspiration toward jocosity, \xe2\x80\x9cof another\r\nmatrimonial venture in our little circle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just telling the Baroness,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Acton was apparently about to announce his own engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEugenia.\r\n\r\nMr. Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s jocosity increased. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not exactly that; but it is\r\nin the family. Clifford, hearing this morning that Mr. Brand had\r\nexpressed a desire to tie the nuptial knot for his sister, took it into\r\nhis head to arrange that, while his hand was in, our good friend should\r\nperform a like ceremony for himself and Lizzie Acton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Baroness threw back her head and smiled at her uncle; then turning,\r\nwith an intenser radiance, to Robert Acton, \xe2\x80\x9cI am certainly very stupid\r\nnot to have thought of that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Acton looked down at his boots,\r\nas if he thought he had perhaps reached the limits of legitimate\r\nexperimentation, and for a moment Eugenia said nothing more. It had\r\nbeen, in fact, a sharp knock, and she needed to recover herself. This\r\nwas done, however, promptly enough. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the young people?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are spending the evening with my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not the thing very sudden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActon looked up. \xe2\x80\x9cExtremely sudden. There had been a tacit\r\nunderstanding; but within a day or two Clifford appears to have\r\nreceived some mysterious impulse to precipitate the affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe impulse,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the charms of your very pretty\r\nsister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my sister\xe2\x80\x99s charms were an old story; he had always known her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nActon had begun to experiment again.\r\n\r\nHere, however, it was evident the Baroness would not help him. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, one\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say! Clifford is very young; but he is a nice boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a likeable sort of boy, and he will be a rich man.\xe2\x80\x9d This was\r\nActon\xe2\x80\x99s last experiment. Madame M\xc3\xbcnster turned away.\r\n\r\nShe made but a short visit and Felix took her home. In her little\r\ndrawing-room she went almost straight to the mirror over the\r\nchimney-piece, and, with a candle uplifted, stood looking into it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall not wait for your marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her brother. \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow\r\nmy maid shall pack up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sister,\xe2\x80\x9d Felix exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are to be married immediately!\r\nMr. Brand is too uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Eugenia, turning and still holding her candle aloft, only looked\r\nabout the little sitting-room at her gimcracks and curtains and\r\ncushions. \xe2\x80\x9cMy maid shall pack up,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9c_Bont\xc3\xa9 divine_, what\r\nrubbish! I feel like a strolling actress; these are my \xe2\x80\x98properties.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the play over, Eugenia?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felix.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a sharp glance. \xe2\x80\x9cI have spoken my part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith great applause!\xe2\x80\x9d said her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, applause\xe2\x80\x94applause!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. And she gathered up two or three\r\nof her dispersed draperies. She glanced at the beautiful brocade, and\r\nthen, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I can have endured it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEndure it a little longer. Come to my wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; that\xe2\x80\x99s your affair. My affairs are elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Germany\xe2\x80\x94by the first ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have decided not to marry Mr. Acton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have refused him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia.\r\n\r\nHer brother looked at her in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined at\r\nlast. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I was very discreet, as you asked me to be. I said nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease continue, then, not to allude to the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eugenia.\r\n\r\nFelix inclined himself gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be obeyed. But your position\r\nin Germany?\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to make no observations upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only going to say that I supposed it was altered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you had signed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not signed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness.\r\n\r\nFelix urged her no further, and it was arranged that he should\r\nimmediately assist her to embark.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand was indeed, it appeared, very impatient to consummate his\r\nsacrifice and deliver the nuptial benediction which would set it off so\r\nhandsomely; but Eugenia\xe2\x80\x99s impatience to withdraw from a country in\r\nwhich she had not found the fortune she had come to seek was even less\r\nto be mistaken. It is true she had not made any very various exertion;\r\nbut she appeared to feel justified in generalizing\xe2\x80\x94in deciding that the\r\nconditions of action on this provincial continent were not favorable to\r\nreally superior women. The elder world was, after all, their natural\r\nfield. The unembarrassed directness with which she proceeded to apply\r\nthese intelligent conclusions appeared to the little circle of\r\nspectators who have figured in our narrative but the supreme exhibition\r\nof a character to which the experience of life had imparted an\r\ninimitable pliancy. It had a distinct effect upon Robert Acton, who,\r\nfor the two days preceding her departure, was a very restless and\r\nirritated mortal. She passed her last evening at her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s, where she\r\nhad never been more charming; and in parting with Clifford Wentworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffianced bride she drew from her own finger a curious old ring and\r\npresented it to her with the prettiest speech and kiss. Gertrude, who\r\nas an affianced bride was also indebted to her gracious bounty, admired\r\nthis little incident extremely, and Robert Acton almost wondered\r\nwhether it did not give him the right, as Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s brother and\r\nguardian, to offer in return a handsome present to the Baroness. It\r\nwould have made him extremely happy to be able to offer a handsome\r\npresent to the Baroness; but he abstained from this expression of his\r\nsentiments, and they were in consequence, at the very last, by so much\r\nthe less comfortable. It was almost at the very last that he saw\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94late the night before she went to Boston to embark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor myself, I wish you might have stayed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not for your\r\nown sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t make so many differences,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baroness. \xe2\x80\x9cI am simply\r\nsorry to be going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a much deeper difference than mine,\xe2\x80\x9d Acton declared; \xe2\x80\x9cfor you\r\nmean you are simply glad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelix parted with her on the deck of the ship. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall often meet\r\nover there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cEurope seems to me much larger than\r\nAmerica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Brand, of course, in the days that immediately followed, was not\r\nthe only impatient spirit; but it may be said that of all the young\r\nspirits interested in the event none rose more eagerly to the level of\r\nthe occasion. Gertrude left her father\xe2\x80\x99s house with Felix Young; they\r\nwere imperturbably happy and they went far away. Clifford and his young\r\nwife sought their felicity in a narrower circle, and the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence upon her husband was such as to justify, strikingly, that\r\ntheory of the elevating effect of easy intercourse with clever women\r\nwhich Felix had propounded to Mr. Wentworth. Gertrude was for a good\r\nwhile a distant figure, but she came back when Charlotte married Mr.\r\nBrand. She was present at the wedding feast, where Felix\xe2\x80\x99s gaiety\r\nconfessed to no change. Then she disappeared, and the echo of a gaiety\r\nof her own, mingled with that of her husband, often came back to the\r\nhome of her earlier years. Mr. Wentworth at last found himself\r\nlistening for it; and Robert Acton, after his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, married a\r\nparticularly nice young girl.\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EUROPEANS ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
