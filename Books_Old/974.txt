It could be done, because there was very little\r\nbusiness at any time, and practically none at all before the evening.  Mr\r\nVerloc cared but little about his ostensible business.  And, moreover,\r\nhis wife was in charge of his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe shop was small, and so was the house.  It was one of those grimy\r\nbrick houses which existed in large quantities before the era of\r\nreconstruction dawned upon London.  The shop was a square box of a place,\r\nwith the front glazed in small panes.  In the daytime the door remained\r\nclosed; in the evening it stood discreetly but suspiciously ajar.\r\n\r\nThe window contained photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls;\r\nnondescript packages in wrappers like patent medicines; closed yellow\r\npaper envelopes, very flimsy, and marked two-and-six in heavy black\r\nfigures; a few numbers of ancient French comic publications hung across a\r\nstring as if to dry; a dingy blue china bowl, a casket of black wood,\r\nbottles of marking ink, and rubber stamps; a few books, with titles\r\nhinting at impropriety; a few apparently old copies of obscure\r\nnewspapers, badly printed, with titles like _The Torch_, _The\r\nGong_\xe2\x80\x94rousing titles.  And the two gas jets inside the panes were always\r\nturned low, either for economy\xe2\x80\x99s sake or for the sake of the customers.\r\n\r\nThese customers were either very young men, who hung about the window for\r\na time before slipping in suddenly; or men of a more mature age, but\r\nlooking generally as if they were not in funds.  Some of that last kind\r\nhad the collars of their overcoats turned right up to their moustaches,\r\nand traces of mud on the bottom of their nether garments, which had the\r\nappearance of being much worn and not very valuable.  And the legs inside\r\nthem did not, as a general rule, seem of much account either.  With their\r\nhands plunged deep in the side pockets of their coats, they dodged in\r\nsideways, one shoulder first, as if afraid to start the bell going.\r\n\r\nThe bell, hung on the door by means of a curved ribbon of steel, was\r\ndifficult to circumvent.  It was hopelessly cracked; but of an evening,\r\nat the slightest provocation, it clattered behind the customer with\r\nimpudent virulence.\r\n\r\nIt clattered; and at that signal, through the dusty glass door behind the\r\npainted deal counter, Mr Verloc would issue hastily from the parlour at\r\nthe back.  His eyes were naturally heavy; he had an air of having\r\nwallowed, fully dressed, all day on an unmade bed.  Another man would\r\nhave felt such an appearance a distinct disadvantage.  In a commercial\r\ntransaction of the retail order much depends on the seller\xe2\x80\x99s engaging and\r\namiable aspect.  But Mr Verloc knew his business, and remained\r\nundisturbed by any sort of \xc3\xa6sthetic doubt about his appearance.  With a\r\nfirm, steady-eyed impudence, which seemed to hold back the threat of some\r\nabominable menace, he would proceed to sell over the counter some object\r\nlooking obviously and scandalously not worth the money which passed in\r\nthe transaction: a small cardboard box with apparently nothing inside,\r\nfor instance, or one of those carefully closed yellow flimsy envelopes,\r\nor a soiled volume in paper covers with a promising title.  Now and then\r\nit happened that one of the faded, yellow dancing girls would get sold to\r\nan amateur, as though she had been alive and young.\r\n\r\nSometimes it was Mrs Verloc who would appear at the call of the cracked\r\nbell.  Winnie Verloc was a young woman with a full bust, in a tight\r\nbodice, and with broad hips.  Her hair was very tidy.  Steady-eyed like\r\nher husband, she preserved an air of unfathomable indifference behind the\r\nrampart of the counter.  Then the customer of comparatively tender years\r\nwould get suddenly disconcerted at having to deal with a woman, and with\r\nrage in his heart would proffer a request for a bottle of marking ink,\r\nretail value sixpence (price in Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s shop one-and-sixpence), which,\r\nonce outside, he would drop stealthily into the gutter.\r\n\r\nThe evening visitors\xe2\x80\x94the men with collars turned up and soft hats rammed\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x94nodded familiarly to Mrs Verloc, and with a muttered greeting,\r\nlifted up the flap at the end of the counter in order to pass into the\r\nback parlour, which gave access to a passage and to a steep flight of\r\nstairs.  The door of the shop was the only means of entrance to the house\r\nin which Mr Verloc carried on his business of a seller of shady wares,\r\nexercised his vocation of a protector of society, and cultivated his\r\ndomestic virtues.  These last were pronounced.  He was thoroughly\r\ndomesticated.  Neither his spiritual, nor his mental, nor his physical\r\nneeds were of the kind to take him much abroad.  He found at home the\r\nease of his body and the peace of his conscience, together with Mrs\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s wifely attentions and Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s deferential regard.\r\n\r\nWinnie\xe2\x80\x99s mother was a stout, wheezy woman, with a large brown face.  She\r\nwore a black wig under a white cap.  Her swollen legs rendered her\r\ninactive.  She considered herself to be of French descent, which might\r\nhave been true; and after a good many years of married life with a\r\nlicensed victualler of the more common sort, she provided for the years\r\nof widowhood by letting furnished apartments for gentlemen near Vauxhall\r\nBridge Road in a square once of some splendour and still included in the\r\ndistrict of Belgravia.  This topographical fact was of some advantage in\r\nadvertising her rooms; but the patrons of the worthy widow were not\r\nexactly of the fashionable kind.  Such as they were, her daughter Winnie\r\nhelped to look after them.  Traces of the French descent which the widow\r\nboasted of were apparent in Winnie too.  They were apparent in the\r\nextremely neat and artistic arrangement of her glossy dark hair.  Winnie\r\nhad also other charms: her youth; her full, rounded form; her clear\r\ncomplexion; the provocation of her unfathomable reserve, which never went\r\nso far as to prevent conversation, carried on on the lodgers\xe2\x80\x99 part with\r\nanimation, and on hers with an equable amiability.  It must be that Mr\r\nVerloc was susceptible to these fascinations.  Mr Verloc was an\r\nintermittent patron.  He came and went without any very apparent reason.\r\nHe generally arrived in London (like the influenza) from the Continent,\r\nonly he arrived unheralded by the Press; and his visitations set in with\r\ngreat severity.  He breakfasted in bed, and remained wallowing there with\r\nan air of quiet enjoyment till noon every day\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes even to a\r\nlater hour.  But when he went out he seemed to experience a great\r\ndifficulty in finding his way back to his temporary home in the\r\nBelgravian square.  He left it late, and returned to it early\xe2\x80\x94as early as\r\nthree or four in the morning; and on waking up at ten addressed Winnie,\r\nbringing in the breakfast tray, with jocular, exhausted civility, in the\r\nhoarse, failing tones of a man who had been talking vehemently for many\r\nhours together.  His prominent, heavy-lidded eyes rolled sideways\r\namorously and languidly, the bedclothes were pulled up to his chin, and\r\nhis dark smooth moustache covered his thick lips capable of much honeyed\r\nbanter.\r\n\r\nIn Winnie\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s opinion Mr Verloc was a very nice gentleman.  From\r\nher life\xe2\x80\x99s experience gathered in various \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness houses\xe2\x80\x9d the good\r\nwoman had taken into her retirement an ideal of gentlemanliness as\r\nexhibited by the patrons of private-saloon bars.  Mr Verloc approached\r\nthat ideal; he attained it, in fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take over your furniture, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Winnie had remarked.\r\n\r\nThe lodging-house was to be given up.  It seems it would not answer to\r\ncarry it on.  It would have been too much trouble for Mr Verloc.  It\r\nwould not have been convenient for his other business.  What his business\r\nwas he did not say; but after his engagement to Winnie he took the\r\ntrouble to get up before noon, and descending the basement stairs, make\r\nhimself pleasant to Winnie\xe2\x80\x99s mother in the breakfast-room downstairs\r\nwhere she had her motionless being.  He stroked the cat, poked the fire,\r\nhad his lunch served to him there.  He left its slightly stuffy cosiness\r\nwith evident reluctance, but, all the same, remained out till the night\r\nwas far advanced.  He never offered to take Winnie to theatres, as such a\r\nnice gentleman ought to have done.  His evenings were occupied.  His work\r\nwas in a way political, he told Winnie once.  She would have, he warned\r\nher, to be very nice to his political friends.\r\n\r\nAnd with her straight, unfathomable glance she answered that she would be\r\nso, of course.\r\n\r\nHow much more he told her as to his occupation it was impossible for\r\nWinnie\xe2\x80\x99s mother to discover.  The married couple took her over with the\r\nfurniture.  The mean aspect of the shop surprised her.  The change from\r\nthe Belgravian square to the narrow street in Soho affected her legs\r\nadversely.  They became of an enormous size.  On the other hand, she\r\nexperienced a complete relief from material cares.  Her son-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheavy good nature inspired her with a sense of absolute safety.  Her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s future was obviously assured, and even as to her son Stevie\r\nshe need have no anxiety.  She had not been able to conceal from herself\r\nthat he was a terrible encumbrance, that poor Stevie.  But in view of\r\nWinnie\xe2\x80\x99s fondness for her delicate brother, and of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s kind and\r\ngenerous disposition, she felt that the poor boy was pretty safe in this\r\nrough world.  And in her heart of hearts she was not perhaps displeased\r\nthat the Verlocs had no children.  As that circumstance seemed perfectly\r\nindifferent to Mr Verloc, and as Winnie found an object of quasi-maternal\r\naffection in her brother, perhaps this was just as well for poor Stevie.\r\n\r\nFor he was difficult to dispose of, that boy.  He was delicate and, in a\r\nfrail way, good-looking too, except for the vacant droop of his lower\r\nlip.  Under our excellent system of compulsory education he had learned\r\nto read and write, notwithstanding the unfavourable aspect of the lower\r\nlip.  But as errand-boy he did not turn out a great success.  He forgot\r\nhis messages; he was easily diverted from the straight path of duty by\r\nthe attractions of stray cats and dogs, which he followed down narrow\r\nalleys into unsavoury courts; by the comedies of the streets, which he\r\ncontemplated open-mouthed, to the detriment of his employer\xe2\x80\x99s interests;\r\nor by the dramas of fallen horses, whose pathos and violence induced him\r\nsometimes to shriek pierceingly in a crowd, which disliked to be\r\ndisturbed by sounds of distress in its quiet enjoyment of the national\r\nspectacle.  When led away by a grave and protecting policeman, it would\r\noften become apparent that poor Stevie had forgotten his address\xe2\x80\x94at least\r\nfor a time.  A brusque question caused him to stutter to the point of\r\nsuffocation.  When startled by anything perplexing he used to squint\r\nhorribly.  However, he never had any fits (which was encouraging); and\r\nbefore the natural outbursts of impatience on the part of his father he\r\ncould always, in his childhood\xe2\x80\x99s days, run for protection behind the\r\nshort skirts of his sister Winnie.  On the other hand, he might have been\r\nsuspected of hiding a fund of reckless naughtiness.  When he had reached\r\nthe age of fourteen a friend of his late father, an agent for a foreign\r\npreserved milk firm, having given him an opening as office-boy, he was\r\ndiscovered one foggy afternoon, in his chief\xe2\x80\x99s absence, busy letting off\r\nfireworks on the staircase.  He touched off in quick succession a set of\r\nfierce rockets, angry catherine wheels, loudly exploding squibs\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nmatter might have turned out very serious.  An awful panic spread through\r\nthe whole building.  Wild-eyed, choking clerks stampeded through the\r\npassages full of smoke, silk hats and elderly business men could be seen\r\nrolling independently down the stairs.  Stevie did not seem to derive any\r\npersonal gratification from what he had done.  His motives for this\r\nstroke of originality were difficult to discover.  It was only later on\r\nthat Winnie obtained from him a misty and confused confession.  It seems\r\nthat two other office-boys in the building had worked upon his feelings\r\nby tales of injustice and oppression till they had wrought his compassion\r\nto the pitch of that frenzy.  But his father\xe2\x80\x99s friend, of course,\r\ndismissed him summarily as likely to ruin his business.  After that\r\naltruistic exploit Stevie was put to help wash the dishes in the basement\r\nkitchen, and to black the boots of the gentlemen patronising the\r\nBelgravian mansion.  There was obviously no future in such work.  The\r\ngentlemen tipped him a shilling now and then.  Mr Verloc showed himself\r\nthe most generous of lodgers.  But altogether all that did not amount to\r\nmuch either in the way of gain or prospects; so that when Winnie\r\nannounced her engagement to Mr Verloc her mother could not help\r\nwondering, with a sigh and a glance towards the scullery, what would\r\nbecome of poor Stephen now.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Mr Verloc was ready to take him over together with his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s mother and with the furniture, which was the whole visible fortune\r\nof the family.  Mr Verloc gathered everything as it came to his broad,\r\ngood-natured breast.  The furniture was disposed to the best advantage\r\nall over the house, but Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother was confined to two back\r\nrooms on the first floor.  The luckless Stevie slept in one of them.  By\r\nthis time a growth of thin fluffy hair had come to blur, like a golden\r\nmist, the sharp line of his small lower jaw.  He helped his sister with\r\nblind love and docility in her household duties.  Mr Verloc thought that\r\nsome occupation would be good for him.  His spare time he occupied by\r\ndrawing circles with compass and pencil on a piece of paper.  He applied\r\nhimself to that pastime with great industry, with his elbows spread out\r\nand bowed low over the kitchen table.  Through the open door of the\r\nparlour at the back of the shop Winnie, his sister, glanced at him from\r\ntime to time with maternal vigilance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the house, the household, and the business Mr Verloc left behind\r\nhim on his way westward at the hour of half-past ten in the morning.  It\r\nwas unusually early for him; his whole person exhaled the charm of almost\r\ndewy freshness; he wore his blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned; his boots\r\nwere shiny; his cheeks, freshly shaven, had a sort of gloss; and even his\r\nheavy-lidded eyes, refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber, sent out\r\nglances of comparative alertness.  Through the park railings these\r\nglances beheld men and women riding in the Row, couples cantering past\r\nharmoniously, others advancing sedately at a walk, loitering groups of\r\nthree or four, solitary horsemen looking unsociable, and solitary women\r\nfollowed at a long distance by a groom with a cockade to his hat and a\r\nleather belt over his tight-fitting coat.  Carriages went bowling by,\r\nmostly two-horse broughams, with here and there a victoria with the skin\r\nof some wild beast inside and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face and hat emerging above the\r\nfolded hood.  And a peculiarly London sun\xe2\x80\x94against which nothing could be\r\nsaid except that it looked bloodshot\xe2\x80\x94glorified all this by its stare.  It\r\nhung at a moderate elevation above Hyde Park Corner with an air of\r\npunctual and benign vigilance.  The very pavement under Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s feet\r\nhad an old-gold tinge in that diffused light, in which neither wall, nor\r\ntree, nor beast, nor man cast a shadow.  Mr Verloc was going westward\r\nthrough a town without shadows in an atmosphere of powdered old gold.\r\nThere were red, coppery gleams on the roofs of houses, on the corners of\r\nwalls, on the panels of carriages, on the very coats of the horses, and\r\non the broad back of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat, where they produced a dull\r\neffect of rustiness.  But Mr Verloc was not in the least conscious of\r\nhaving got rusty.  He surveyed through the park railings the evidences of\r\nthe town\xe2\x80\x99s opulence and luxury with an approving eye.  All these people\r\nhad to be protected.  Protection is the first necessity of opulence and\r\nluxury.  They had to be protected; and their horses, carriages, houses,\r\nservants had to be protected; and the source of their wealth had to be\r\nprotected in the heart of the city and the heart of the country; the\r\nwhole social order favourable to their hygienic idleness had to be\r\nprotected against the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour.  It had\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94and Mr Verloc would have rubbed his hands with satisfaction had he not\r\nbeen constitutionally averse from every superfluous exertion.  His\r\nidleness was not hygienic, but it suited him very well.  He was in a\r\nmanner devoted to it with a sort of inert fanaticism, or perhaps rather\r\nwith a fanatical inertness.  Born of industrious parents for a life of\r\ntoil, he had embraced indolence from an impulse as profound as\r\ninexplicable and as imperious as the impulse which directs a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npreference for one particular woman in a given thousand.  He was too lazy\r\neven for a mere demagogue, for a workman orator, for a leader of labour.\r\nIt was too much trouble.  He required a more perfect form of ease; or it\r\nmight have been that he was the victim of a philosophical unbelief in the\r\neffectiveness of every human effort.  Such a form of indolence requires,\r\nimplies, a certain amount of intelligence.  Mr Verloc was not devoid of\r\nintelligence\xe2\x80\x94and at the notion of a menaced social order he would perhaps\r\nhave winked to himself if there had not been an effort to make in that\r\nsign of scepticism.  His big, prominent eyes were not well adapted to\r\nwinking.  They were rather of the sort that closes solemnly in slumber\r\nwith majestic effect.\r\n\r\nUndemonstrative and burly in a fat-pig style, Mr Verloc, without either\r\nrubbing his hands with satisfaction or winking sceptically at his\r\nthoughts, proceeded on his way.  He trod the pavement heavily with his\r\nshiny boots, and his general get-up was that of a well-to-do mechanic in\r\nbusiness for himself.  He might have been anything from a picture-frame\r\nmaker to a lock-smith; an employer of labour in a small way.  But there\r\nwas also about him an indescribable air which no mechanic could have\r\nacquired in the practice of his handicraft however dishonestly exercised:\r\nthe air common to men who live on the vices, the follies, or the baser\r\nfears of mankind; the air of moral nihilism common to keepers of gambling\r\nhells and disorderly houses; to private detectives and inquiry agents; to\r\ndrink sellers and, I should say, to the sellers of invigorating electric\r\nbelts and to the inventors of patent medicines.  But of that last I am\r\nnot sure, not having carried my investigations so far into the depths.\r\nFor all I know, the expression of these last may be perfectly diabolic.\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised.  What I want to affirm is that Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpression was by no means diabolic.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching Knightsbridge, Mr Verloc took a turn to the left out of\r\nthe busy main thoroughfare, uproarious with the traffic of swaying\r\nomnibuses and trotting vans, in the almost silent, swift flow of hansoms.\r\nUnder his hat, worn with a slight backward tilt, his hair had been\r\ncarefully brushed into respectful sleekness; for his business was with an\r\nEmbassy.  And Mr Verloc, steady like a rock\xe2\x80\x94a soft kind of rock\xe2\x80\x94marched\r\nnow along a street which could with every propriety be described as\r\nprivate.  In its breadth, emptiness, and extent it had the majesty of\r\ninorganic nature, of matter that never dies.  The only reminder of\r\nmortality was a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s brougham arrested in august solitude close to\r\nthe curbstone.  The polished knockers of the doors gleamed as far as the\r\neye could reach, the clean windows shone with a dark opaque lustre.  And\r\nall was still.  But a milk cart rattled noisily across the distant\r\nperspective; a butcher boy, driving with the noble recklessness of a\r\ncharioteer at Olympic Games, dashed round the corner sitting high above a\r\npair of red wheels.  A guilty-looking cat issuing from under the stones\r\nran for a while in front of Mr Verloc, then dived into another basement;\r\nand a thick police constable, looking a stranger to every emotion, as if\r\nhe too were part of inorganic nature, surging apparently out of a\r\nlamp-post, took not the slightest notice of Mr Verloc.  With a turn to\r\nthe left Mr Verloc pursued his way along a narrow street by the side of a\r\nyellow wall which, for some inscrutable reason, had No. 1 Chesham Square\r\nwritten on it in black letters.  Chesham Square was at least sixty yards\r\naway, and Mr Verloc, cosmopolitan enough not to be deceived by London\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntopographical mysteries, held on steadily, without a sign of surprise or\r\nindignation.  At last, with business-like persistency, he reached the\r\nSquare, and made diagonally for the number 10.  This belonged to an\r\nimposing carriage gate in a high, clean wall between two houses, of which\r\none rationally enough bore the number 9 and the other was numbered 37;\r\nbut the fact that this last belonged to Porthill Street, a street well\r\nknown in the neighbourhood, was proclaimed by an inscription placed above\r\nthe ground-floor windows by whatever highly efficient authority is\r\ncharged with the duty of keeping track of London\xe2\x80\x99s strayed houses.  Why\r\npowers are not asked of Parliament (a short act would do) for compelling\r\nthose edifices to return where they belong is one of the mysteries of\r\nmunicipal administration.  Mr Verloc did not trouble his head about it,\r\nhis mission in life being the protection of the social mechanism, not its\r\nperfectionment or even its criticism.\r\n\r\nIt was so early that the porter of the Embassy issued hurriedly out of\r\nhis lodge still struggling with the left sleeve of his livery coat.  His\r\nwaistcoat was red, and he wore knee-breeches, but his aspect was\r\nflustered.  Mr Verloc, aware of the rush on his flank, drove it off by\r\nsimply holding out an envelope stamped with the arms of the Embassy, and\r\npassed on.  He produced the same talisman also to the footman who opened\r\nthe door, and stood back to let him enter the hall.\r\n\r\nA clear fire burned in a tall fireplace, and an elderly man standing with\r\nhis back to it, in evening dress and with a chain round his neck, glanced\r\nup from the newspaper he was holding spread out in both hands before his\r\ncalm and severe face.  He didn\xe2\x80\x99t move; but another lackey, in brown\r\ntrousers and claw-hammer coat edged with thin yellow cord, approaching Mr\r\nVerloc listened to the murmur of his name, and turning round on his heel\r\nin silence, began to walk, without looking back once.  Mr Verloc, thus\r\nled along a ground-floor passage to the left of the great carpeted\r\nstaircase, was suddenly motioned to enter a quite small room furnished\r\nwith a heavy writing-table and a few chairs.  The servant shut the door,\r\nand Mr Verloc remained alone.  He did not take a seat.  With his hat and\r\nstick held in one hand he glanced about, passing his other podgy hand\r\nover his uncovered sleek head.\r\n\r\nAnother door opened noiselessly, and Mr Verloc immobilising his glance in\r\nthat direction saw at first only black clothes, the bald top of a head,\r\nand a drooping dark grey whisker on each side of a pair of wrinkled\r\nhands.  The person who had entered was holding a batch of papers before\r\nhis eyes and walked up to the table with a rather mincing step, turning\r\nthe papers over the while.  Privy Councillor Wurmt, Chancelier\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Ambassade, was rather short-sighted.  This meritorious official laying\r\nthe papers on the table, disclosed a face of pasty complexion and of\r\nmelancholy ugliness surrounded by a lot of fine, long dark grey hairs,\r\nbarred heavily by thick and bushy eyebrows.  He put on a black-framed\r\npince-nez upon a blunt and shapeless nose, and seemed struck by Mr\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.  Under the enormous eyebrows his weak eyes blinked\r\npathetically through the glasses.\r\n\r\nHe made no sign of greeting; neither did Mr Verloc, who certainly knew\r\nhis place; but a subtle change about the general outlines of his\r\nshoulders and back suggested a slight bending of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s spine under\r\nthe vast surface of his overcoat.  The effect was of unobtrusive\r\ndeference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have here some of your reports,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bureaucrat in an\r\nunexpectedly soft and weary voice, and pressing the tip of his forefinger\r\non the papers with force.  He paused; and Mr Verloc, who had recognised\r\nhis own handwriting very well, waited in an almost breathless silence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not very satisfied with the attitude of the police here,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nother continued, with every appearance of mental fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe shoulders of Mr Verloc, without actually moving, suggested a shrug.\r\nAnd for the first time since he left his home that morning his lips\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery country has its police,\xe2\x80\x9d he said philosophically.  But as the\r\nofficial of the Embassy went on blinking at him steadily he felt\r\nconstrained to add: \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to observe that I have no means of action\r\nupon the police here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is desired,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man of papers, \xe2\x80\x9cis the occurrence of\r\nsomething definite which should stimulate their vigilance.  That is\r\nwithin your province\xe2\x80\x94is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc made no answer except by a sigh, which escaped him\r\ninvoluntarily, for instantly he tried to give his face a cheerful\r\nexpression.  The official blinked doubtfully, as if affected by the dim\r\nlight of the room.  He repeated vaguely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe vigilance of the police\xe2\x80\x94and the severity of the magistrates.  The\r\ngeneral leniency of the judicial procedure here, and the utter absence of\r\nall repressive measures, are a scandal to Europe.  What is wished for\r\njust now is the accentuation of the unrest\xe2\x80\x94of the fermentation which\r\nundoubtedly exists\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly, undoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in Mr Verloc in a deep deferential bass\r\nof an oratorical quality, so utterly different from the tone in which he\r\nhad spoken before that his interlocutor remained profoundly surprised.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt exists to a dangerous degree.  My reports for the last twelve months\r\nmake it sufficiently clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour reports for the last twelve months,\xe2\x80\x9d State Councillor Wurmt began\r\nin his gentle and dispassionate tone, \xe2\x80\x9chave been read by me.  I failed to\r\ndiscover why you wrote them at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sad silence reigned for a time.  Mr Verloc seemed to have swallowed his\r\ntongue, and the other gazed at the papers on the table fixedly.  At last\r\nhe gave them a slight push.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe state of affairs you expose there is assumed to exist as the first\r\ncondition of your employment.  What is required at present is not\r\nwriting, but the bringing to light of a distinct, significant fact\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwould almost say of an alarming fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need not say that all my endeavours shall be directed to that end,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr\r\nVerloc said, with convinced modulations in his conversational husky tone.\r\nBut the sense of being blinked at watchfully behind the blind glitter of\r\nthese eye-glasses on the other side of the table disconcerted him.  He\r\nstopped short with a gesture of absolute devotion.  The useful,\r\nhard-working, if obscure member of the Embassy had an air of being\r\nimpressed by some newly-born thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very corpulent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThis observation, really of a psychological nature, and advanced with the\r\nmodest hesitation of an officeman more familiar with ink and paper than\r\nwith the requirements of active life, stung Mr Verloc in the manner of a\r\nrude personal remark.  He stepped back a pace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh?  What were you pleased to say?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with husky resentment.\r\n\r\nThe Chancelier d\xe2\x80\x99Ambassade entrusted with the conduct of this interview\r\nseemed to find it too much for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you had better see Mr Vladimir.  Yes, decidedly\r\nI think you ought to see Mr Vladimir.  Be good enough to wait here,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, and went out with mincing steps.\r\n\r\nAt once Mr Verloc passed his hand over his hair.  A slight perspiration\r\nhad broken out on his forehead.  He let the air escape from his pursed-up\r\nlips like a man blowing at a spoonful of hot soup.  But when the servant\r\nin brown appeared at the door silently, Mr Verloc had not moved an inch\r\nfrom the place he had occupied throughout the interview.  He had remained\r\nmotionless, as if feeling himself surrounded by pitfalls.\r\n\r\nHe walked along a passage lighted by a lonely gas-jet, then up a flight\r\nof winding stairs, and through a glazed and cheerful corridor on the\r\nfirst floor.  The footman threw open a door, and stood aside.  The feet\r\nof Mr Verloc felt a thick carpet.  The room was large, with three\r\nwindows; and a young man with a shaven, big face, sitting in a roomy\r\narm-chair before a vast mahogany writing-table, said in French to the\r\nChancelier d\xe2\x80\x99Ambassade, who was going out with the papers in his hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, mon cher.  He\xe2\x80\x99s fat\xe2\x80\x94the animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir, First Secretary, had a drawing-room reputation as an\r\nagreeable and entertaining man.  He was something of a favourite in\r\nsociety.  His wit consisted in discovering droll connections between\r\nincongruous ideas; and when talking in that strain he sat well forward of\r\nhis seat, with his left hand raised, as if exhibiting his funny\r\ndemonstrations between the thumb and forefinger, while his round and\r\nclean-shaven face wore an expression of merry perplexity.\r\n\r\nBut there was no trace of merriment or perplexity in the way he looked at\r\nMr Verloc.  Lying far back in the deep arm-chair, with squarely spread\r\nelbows, and throwing one leg over a thick knee, he had with his smooth\r\nand rosy countenance the air of a preternaturally thriving baby that will\r\nnot stand nonsense from anybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand French, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc stated huskily that he did.  His whole vast bulk had a forward\r\ninclination.  He stood on the carpet in the middle of the room, clutching\r\nhis hat and stick in one hand; the other hung lifelessly by his side.  He\r\nmuttered unobtrusively somewhere deep down in his throat something about\r\nhaving done his military service in the French artillery.  At once, with\r\ncontemptuous perversity, Mr Vladimir changed the language, and began to\r\nspeak idiomatic English without the slightest trace of a foreign accent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  Yes.  Of course.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s see.  How much did you get for obtaining\r\nthe design of the improved breech-block of their new field-gun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive years\xe2\x80\x99 rigorous confinement in a fortress,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc answered\r\nunexpectedly, but without any sign of feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got off easily,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s comment.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, anyhow, it served\r\nyou right for letting yourself get caught.  What made you go in for that\r\nsort of thing\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s husky conversational voice was heard speaking of youth, of a\r\nfatal infatuation for an unworthy\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!  Cherchez la femme,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir deigned to interrupt, unbending,\r\nbut without affability; there was, on the contrary, a touch of grimness\r\nin his condescension.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been employed by the Embassy\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver since the time of the late Baron Stott-Wartenheim,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc\r\nanswered in subdued tones, and protruding his lips sadly, in sign of\r\nsorrow for the deceased diplomat.  The First Secretary observed this play\r\nof physiognomy steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ever since.  Well!  What have you got to say for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc answered with some surprise that he was not aware of having\r\nanything special to say.  He had been summoned by a letter\xe2\x80\x94And he plunged\r\nhis hand busily into the side pocket of his overcoat, but before the\r\nmocking, cynical watchfulness of Mr Vladimir, concluded to leave it\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said that latter.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by getting out of condition\r\nlike this?  You haven\xe2\x80\x99t got even the physique of your profession.  You\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmember of a starving proletariat\xe2\x80\x94never!  You\xe2\x80\x94a desperate socialist or\r\nanarchist\xe2\x80\x94which is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnarchist,\xe2\x80\x9d stated Mr Verloc in a deadened tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBosh!\xe2\x80\x9d went on Mr Vladimir, without raising his voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou startled\r\nold Wurmt himself.  You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t deceive an idiot.  They all are that\r\nby-the-by, but you seem to me simply impossible.  So you began your\r\nconnection with us by stealing the French gun designs.  And you got\r\nyourself caught.  That must have been very disagreeable to our\r\nGovernment.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be very smart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc tried to exculpate himself huskily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve had occasion to observe before, a fatal infatuation for an\r\nunworthy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir raised a large white, plump hand.  \xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes.  The unlucky\r\nattachment\xe2\x80\x94of your youth.  She got hold of the money, and then sold you\r\nto the police\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doleful change in Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s physiognomy, the momentary drooping of\r\nhis whole person, confessed that such was the regrettable case.  Mr\r\nVladimir\xe2\x80\x99s hand clasped the ankle reposing on his knee.  The sock was of\r\ndark blue silk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, that was not very clever of you.  Perhaps you are too\r\nsusceptible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc intimated in a throaty, veiled murmur that he was no longer\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  That\xe2\x80\x99s a failing which age does not cure,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir remarked,\r\nwith sinister familiarity.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut no!  You are too fat for that.  You\r\ncould not have come to look like this if you had been at all susceptible.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I think is the matter: you are a lazy fellow.  How\r\nlong have you been drawing pay from this Embassy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEleven years,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, after a moment of sulky hesitation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been charged with several missions to London while His Excellency\r\nBaron Stott-Wartenheim was still Ambassador in Paris.  Then by his\r\nExcellency\xe2\x80\x99s instructions I settled down in London.  I am English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are!  Are you?  Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA natural-born British subject,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc said stolidly.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut my\r\nfather was French, and so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind explaining,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the other.  \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you could\r\nhave been legally a Marshal of France and a Member of Parliament in\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x94and then, indeed, you would have been of some use to our\r\nEmbassy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis flight of fancy provoked something like a faint smile on Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface.  Mr Vladimir retained an imperturbable gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, you are a lazy fellow; you don\xe2\x80\x99t use your\r\nopportunities.  In the time of Baron Stott-Wartenheim we had a lot of\r\nsoft-headed people running this Embassy.  They caused fellows of your\r\nsort to form a false conception of the nature of a secret service fund.\r\nIt is my business to correct this misapprehension by telling you what the\r\nsecret service is not.  It is not a philanthropic institution.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nyou called here on purpose to tell you this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir observed the forced expression of bewilderment on Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, and smiled sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that you understand me perfectly.  I daresay you are intelligent\r\nenough for your work.  What we want now is activity\xe2\x80\x94activity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn repeating this last word Mr Vladimir laid a long white forefinger on\r\nthe edge of the desk.  Every trace of huskiness disappeared from Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice.  The nape of his gross neck became crimson above the velvet collar\r\nof his overcoat.  His lips quivered before they came widely open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll only be good enough to look up my record,\xe2\x80\x9d he boomed out in\r\nhis great, clear oratorical bass, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see I gave a warning only three\r\nmonths ago, on the occasion of the Grand Duke Romuald\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Paris,\r\nwhich was telegraphed from here to the French police, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut!\xe2\x80\x9d broke out Mr Vladimir, with a frowning grimace.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe French\r\npolice had no use for your warning.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t roar like this.  What the\r\ndevil do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a note of proud humility Mr Verloc apologised for forgetting\r\nhimself.  His voice,\xe2\x80\x94famous for years at open-air meetings and at\r\nworkmen\xe2\x80\x99s assemblies in large halls, had contributed, he said, to his\r\nreputation of a good and trustworthy comrade.  It was, therefore, a part\r\nof his usefulness.  It had inspired confidence in his principles.  \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nalways put up to speak by the leaders at a critical moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc\r\ndeclared, with obvious satisfaction.  There was no uproar above which he\r\ncould not make himself heard, he added; and suddenly he made a\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  With lowered forehead, without looking up, swiftly\r\nand ponderously he crossed the room to one of the French windows.  As if\r\ngiving way to an uncontrollable impulse, he opened it a little.  Mr\r\nVladimir, jumping up amazed from the depths of the arm-chair, looked over\r\nhis shoulder; and below, across the courtyard of the Embassy, well beyond\r\nthe open gate, could be seen the broad back of a policeman watching idly\r\nthe gorgeous perambulator of a wealthy baby being wheeled in state across\r\nthe Square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConstable!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Verloc, with no more effort than if he were\r\nwhispering; and Mr Vladimir burst into a laugh on seeing the policeman\r\nspin round as if prodded by a sharp instrument.  Mr Verloc shut the\r\nwindow quietly, and returned to the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a voice like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting on the husky conversational\r\npedal, \xe2\x80\x9cI was naturally trusted.  And I knew what to say, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir, arranging his cravat, observed him in the glass over the\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you have the social revolutionary jargon by heart well\r\nenough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said contemptuously.  \xe2\x80\x9cVox et. . . You haven\xe2\x80\x99t ever studied\r\nLatin\xe2\x80\x94have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Mr Verloc.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou did not expect me to know it.  I belong to\r\nthe million.  Who knows Latin?  Only a few hundred imbeciles who aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfit to take care of themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some thirty seconds longer Mr Vladimir studied in the mirror the\r\nfleshy profile, the gross bulk, of the man behind him.  And at the same\r\ntime he had the advantage of seeing his own face, clean-shaved and round,\r\nrosy about the gills, and with the thin sensitive lips formed exactly for\r\nthe utterance of those delicate witticisms which had made him such a\r\nfavourite in the very highest society.  Then he turned, and advanced into\r\nthe room with such determination that the very ends of his quaintly\r\nold-fashioned bow necktie seemed to bristle with unspeakable menaces.\r\nThe movement was so swift and fierce that Mr Verloc, casting an oblique\r\nglance, quailed inwardly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!  You dare be impudent,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir began, with an amazingly\r\nguttural intonation not only utterly un-English, but absolutely\r\nun-European, and startling even to Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s experience of cosmopolitan\r\nslums.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou dare!  Well, I am going to speak plain English to you.\r\nVoice won\xe2\x80\x99t do.  We have no use for your voice.  We don\xe2\x80\x99t want a voice.\r\nWe want facts\xe2\x80\x94startling facts\xe2\x80\x94damn you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a sort of\r\nferocious discretion, right into Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you try to come over me with your Hyperborean manners,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc\r\ndefended himself huskily, looking at the carpet.  At this his\r\ninterlocutor, smiling mockingly above the bristling bow of his necktie,\r\nswitched the conversation into French.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou give yourself for an \xe2\x80\x98agent provocateur.\xe2\x80\x99  The proper business of an\r\n\xe2\x80\x98agent provocateur\xe2\x80\x99 is to provoke.  As far as I can judge from your\r\nrecord kept here, you have done nothing to earn your money for the last\r\nthree years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Verloc, stirring not a limb, and not raising his\r\neyes, but with the note of sincere feeling in his tone.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have several\r\ntimes prevented what might have been\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a proverb in this country which says prevention is better than\r\ncure,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr Vladimir, throwing himself into the arm-chair.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis stupid in a general way.  There is no end to prevention.  But it is\r\ncharacteristic.  They dislike finality in this country.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be too\r\nEnglish.  And in this particular instance, don\xe2\x80\x99t be absurd.  The evil is\r\nalready here.  We don\xe2\x80\x99t want prevention\xe2\x80\x94we want cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, turned to the desk, and turning over some papers lying there,\r\nspoke in a changed business-like tone, without looking at Mr Verloc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, of course, of the International Conference assembled in\r\nMilan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc intimated hoarsely that he was in the habit of reading the\r\ndaily papers.  To a further question his answer was that, of course, he\r\nunderstood what he read.  At this Mr Vladimir, smiling faintly at the\r\ndocuments he was still scanning one after another, murmured \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as\r\nit is not written in Latin, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr Chinese,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr Verloc stolidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m.  Some of your revolutionary friends\xe2\x80\x99 effusions are written in a\r\n_charabia_ every bit as incomprehensible as Chinese\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr Vladimir let\r\nfall disdainfully a grey sheet of printed matter.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are all these\r\nleaflets headed F. P., with a hammer, pen, and torch crossed?  What does\r\nit mean, this F. P.?\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr Verloc approached the imposing writing-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Future of the Proletariat.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a society,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, standing\r\nponderously by the side of the arm-chair, \xe2\x80\x9cnot anarchist in principle,\r\nbut open to all shades of revolutionary opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the Vice-Presidents,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc breathed out heavily; and the\r\nFirst Secretary of the Embassy raised his head to look at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you ought to be ashamed of yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said incisively.  \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyour society capable of anything else but printing this prophetic bosh in\r\nblunt type on this filthy paper eh?  Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you do something?  Look\r\nhere.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve this matter in hand now, and I tell you plainly that you will\r\nhave to earn your money.  The good old Stott-Wartenheim times are over.\r\nNo work, no pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc felt a queer sensation of faintness in his stout legs.  He\r\nstepped back one pace, and blew his nose loudly.\r\n\r\nHe was, in truth, startled and alarmed.  The rusty London sunshine\r\nstruggling clear of the London mist shed a lukewarm brightness into the\r\nFirst Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s private room; and in the silence Mr Verloc heard\r\nagainst a window-pane the faint buzzing of a fly\xe2\x80\x94his first fly of the\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x94heralding better than any number of swallows the approach of spring.\r\nThe useless fussing of that tiny energetic organism affected unpleasantly\r\nthis big man threatened in his indolence.\r\n\r\nIn the pause Mr Vladimir formulated in his mind a series of disparaging\r\nremarks concerning Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s face and figure.  The fellow was\r\nunexpectedly vulgar, heavy, and impudently unintelligent.  He looked\r\nuncommonly like a master plumber come to present his bill.  The First\r\nSecretary of the Embassy, from his occasional excursions into the field\r\nof American humour, had formed a special notion of that class of mechanic\r\nas the embodiment of fraudulent laziness and incompetency.\r\n\r\nThis was then the famous and trusty secret agent, so secret that he was\r\nnever designated otherwise but by the symbol [delta] in the late Baron\r\nStott-Wartenheim\xe2\x80\x99s official, semi-official, and confidential\r\ncorrespondence; the celebrated agent [delta], whose warnings had the\r\npower to change the schemes and the dates of royal, imperial, grand ducal\r\njourneys, and sometimes caused them to be put off altogether!  This\r\nfellow!  And Mr Vladimir indulged mentally in an enormous and derisive\r\nfit of merriment, partly at his own astonishment, which he judged naive,\r\nbut mostly at the expense of the universally regretted Baron\r\nStott-Wartenheim.  His late Excellency, whom the august favour of his\r\nImperial master had imposed as Ambassador upon several reluctant\r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs, had enjoyed in his lifetime a fame for an\r\nowlish, pessimistic gullibility.  His Excellency had the social\r\nrevolution on the brain.  He imagined himself to be a diplomatist set\r\napart by a special dispensation to watch the end of diplomacy, and pretty\r\nnearly the end of the world, in a horrid democratic upheaval.  His\r\nprophetic and doleful despatches had been for years the joke of Foreign\r\nOffices.  He was said to have exclaimed on his deathbed (visited by his\r\nImperial friend and master): \xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy Europe!  Thou shalt perish by the\r\nmoral insanity of thy children!\xe2\x80\x9d  He was fated to be the victim of the\r\nfirst humbugging rascal that came along, thought Mr Vladimir, smiling\r\nvaguely at Mr Verloc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to venerate the memory of Baron Stott-Wartenheim,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe lowered physiognomy of Mr Verloc expressed a sombre and weary\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to observe to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I came here because I was\r\nsummoned by a peremptory letter.  I have been here only twice before in\r\nthe last eleven years, and certainly never at eleven in the morning.  It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t very wise to call me up like this.  There is just a chance of being\r\nseen.  And that would be no joke for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would destroy my usefulness,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the other hotly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s your affair,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mr Vladimir, with soft brutality.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nyou cease to be useful you shall cease to be employed.  Yes.  Right off.\r\nCut short.  You shall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir, frowning, paused, at a loss for a\r\nsufficiently idiomatic expression, and instantly brightened up, with a\r\ngrin of beautifully white teeth.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be chucked,\xe2\x80\x9d he brought out\r\nferociously.\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr Verloc had to react with all the force of his will against\r\nthat sensation of faintness running down one\xe2\x80\x99s legs which once upon a\r\ntime had inspired some poor devil with the felicitous expression: \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nheart went down into my boots.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr Verloc, aware of the sensation,\r\nraised his head bravely.\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir bore the look of heavy inquiry with perfect serenity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we want is to administer a tonic to the Conference in Milan,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid airily.  \xe2\x80\x9cIts deliberations upon international action for the\r\nsuppression of political crime don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get anywhere.  England lags.\r\nThis country is absurd with its sentimental regard for individual\r\nliberty.  It\xe2\x80\x99s intolerable to think that all your friends have got only\r\nto come over to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that way I have them all under my eye,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc interrupted\r\nhuskily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be much more to the point to have them all under lock and key.\r\nEngland must be brought into line.  The imbecile bourgeoisie of this\r\ncountry make themselves the accomplices of the very people whose aim is\r\nto drive them out of their houses to starve in ditches.  And they have\r\nthe political power still, if they only had the sense to use it for their\r\npreservation.  I suppose you agree that the middle classes are stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc agreed hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have no imagination.  They are blinded by an idiotic vanity.  What\r\nthey want just now is a jolly good scare.  This is the psychological\r\nmoment to set your friends to work.  I have had you called here to\r\ndevelop to you my idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr Vladimir developed his idea from on high, with scorn and\r\ncondescension, displaying at the same time an amount of ignorance as to\r\nthe real aims, thoughts, and methods of the revolutionary world which\r\nfilled the silent Mr Verloc with inward consternation.  He confounded\r\ncauses with effects more than was excusable; the most distinguished\r\npropagandists with impulsive bomb throwers; assumed organisation where in\r\nthe nature of things it could not exist; spoke of the social\r\nrevolutionary party one moment as of a perfectly disciplined army, where\r\nthe word of chiefs was supreme, and at another as if it had been the\r\nloosest association of desperate brigands that ever camped in a mountain\r\ngorge.  Once Mr Verloc had opened his mouth for a protest, but the\r\nraising of a shapely, large white hand arrested him.  Very soon he became\r\ntoo appalled to even try to protest.  He listened in a stillness of dread\r\nwhich resembled the immobility of profound attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA series of outrages,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir continued calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cexecuted here in\r\nthis country; not only _planned_ here\xe2\x80\x94that would not do\xe2\x80\x94they would not\r\nmind.  Your friends could set half the Continent on fire without\r\ninfluencing the public opinion here in favour of a universal repressive\r\nlegislation.  They will not look outside their backyard here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc cleared his throat, but his heart failed him, and he said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese outrages need not be especially sanguinary,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir went on,\r\nas if delivering a scientific lecture, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they must be sufficiently\r\nstartling\xe2\x80\x94effective.  Let them be directed against buildings, for\r\ninstance.  What is the fetish of the hour that all the bourgeoisie\r\nrecognise\xe2\x80\x94eh, Mr Verloc?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc opened his hands and shrugged his shoulders slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too lazy to think,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s comment upon that gesture.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay attention to what I say.  The fetish of to-day is neither royalty\r\nnor religion.  Therefore the palace and the church should be left alone.\r\nYou understand what I mean, Mr Verloc?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dismay and the scorn of Mr Verloc found vent in an attempt at levity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly.  But what of the Embassies?  A series of attacks on the\r\nvarious Embassies,\xe2\x80\x9d he began; but he could not withstand the cold,\r\nwatchful stare of the First Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can be facetious, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d the latter observed carelessly.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall right.  It may enliven your oratory at socialistic congresses.  But\r\nthis room is no place for it.  It would be infinitely safer for you to\r\nfollow carefully what I am saying.  As you are being called upon to\r\nfurnish facts instead of cock-and-bull stories, you had better try to\r\nmake your profit off what I am taking the trouble to explain to you.  The\r\nsacrosanct fetish of to-day is science.  Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get some of your\r\nfriends to go for that wooden-faced panjandrum\xe2\x80\x94eh?  Is it not part of\r\nthese institutions which must be swept away before the F. P. comes\r\nalong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc said nothing.  He was afraid to open his lips lest a groan\r\nshould escape him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what you should try for.  An attempt upon a crowned head or on a\r\npresident is sensational enough in a way, but not so much as it used to\r\nbe.  It has entered into the general conception of the existence of all\r\nchiefs of state.  It\xe2\x80\x99s almost conventional\xe2\x80\x94especially since so many\r\npresidents have been assassinated.  Now let us take an outrage upon\xe2\x80\x94say a\r\nchurch.  Horrible enough at first sight, no doubt, and yet not so\r\neffective as a person of an ordinary mind might think.  No matter how\r\nrevolutionary and anarchist in inception, there would be fools enough to\r\ngive such an outrage the character of a religious manifestation.  And\r\nthat would detract from the especial alarming significance we wish to\r\ngive to the act.  A murderous attempt on a restaurant or a theatre would\r\nsuffer in the same way from the suggestion of non-political passion: the\r\nexasperation of a hungry man, an act of social revenge.  All this is used\r\nup; it is no longer instructive as an object lesson in revolutionary\r\nanarchism.  Every newspaper has ready-made phrases to explain such\r\nmanifestations away.  I am about to give you the philosophy of bomb\r\nthrowing from my point of view; from the point of view you pretend to\r\nhave been serving for the last eleven years.  I will try not to talk\r\nabove your head.  The sensibilities of the class you are attacking are\r\nsoon blunted.  Property seems to them an indestructible thing.  You can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncount upon their emotions either of pity or fear for very long.  A bomb\r\noutrage to have any influence on public opinion now must go beyond the\r\nintention of vengeance or terrorism.  It must be purely destructive.  It\r\nmust be that, and only that, beyond the faintest suspicion of any other\r\nobject.  You anarchists should make it clear that you are perfectly\r\ndetermined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation.  But how\r\nto get that appallingly absurd notion into the heads of the middle\r\nclasses so that there should be no mistake?  That\xe2\x80\x99s the question.  By\r\ndirecting your blows at something outside the ordinary passions of\r\nhumanity is the answer.  Of course, there is art.  A bomb in the National\r\nGallery would make some noise.  But it would not be serious enough.  Art\r\nhas never been their fetish.  It\xe2\x80\x99s like breaking a few back windows in a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s house; whereas, if you want to make him really sit up, you must try\r\nat least to raise the roof.  There would be some screaming of course, but\r\nfrom whom?  Artists\xe2\x80\x94art critics and such like\xe2\x80\x94people of no account.\r\nNobody minds what they say.  But there is learning\xe2\x80\x94science.  Any imbecile\r\nthat has got an income believes in that.  He does not know why, but he\r\nbelieves it matters somehow.  It is the sacrosanct fetish.  All the\r\ndamned professors are radicals at heart.  Let them know that their great\r\npanjandrum has got to go too, to make room for the Future of the\r\nProletariat.  A howl from all these intellectual idiots is bound to help\r\nforward the labours of the Milan Conference.  They will be writing to the\r\npapers.  Their indignation would be above suspicion, no material\r\ninterests being openly at stake, and it will alarm every selfishness of\r\nthe class which should be impressed.  They believe that in some\r\nmysterious way science is at the source of their material prosperity.\r\nThey do.  And the absurd ferocity of such a demonstration will affect\r\nthem more profoundly than the mangling of a whole street\xe2\x80\x94or theatre\xe2\x80\x94full\r\nof their own kind.  To that last they can always say: \xe2\x80\x98Oh! it\xe2\x80\x99s mere\r\nclass hate.\xe2\x80\x99  But what is one to say to an act of destructive ferocity so\r\nabsurd as to be incomprehensible, inexplicable, almost unthinkable; in\r\nfact, mad?  Madness alone is truly terrifying, inasmuch as you cannot\r\nplacate it either by threats, persuasion, or bribes.  Moreover, I am a\r\ncivilised man.  I would never dream of directing you to organise a mere\r\nbutchery, even if I expected the best results from it.  But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect from a butchery the result I want.  Murder is always with us.  It\r\nis almost an institution.  The demonstration must be against\r\nlearning\xe2\x80\x94science.  But not every science will do.  The attack must have\r\nall the shocking senselessness of gratuitous blasphemy.  Since bombs are\r\nyour means of expression, it would be really telling if one could throw a\r\nbomb into pure mathematics.  But that is impossible.  I have been trying\r\nto educate you; I have expounded to you the higher philosophy of your\r\nusefulness, and suggested to you some serviceable arguments.  The\r\npractical application of my teaching interests _you_ mostly.  But from\r\nthe moment I have undertaken to interview you I have also given some\r\nattention to the practical aspect of the question.  What do you think of\r\nhaving a go at astronomy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor sometime already Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s immobility by the side of the arm-chair\r\nresembled a state of collapsed coma\xe2\x80\x94a sort of passive insensibility\r\ninterrupted by slight convulsive starts, such as may be observed in the\r\ndomestic dog having a nightmare on the hearthrug.  And it was in an\r\nuneasy doglike growl that he repeated the word:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstronomy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not recovered thoroughly as yet from that state of bewilderment\r\nbrought about by the effort to follow Mr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s rapid incisive\r\nutterance.  It had overcome his power of assimilation.  It had made him\r\nangry.  This anger was complicated by incredulity.  And suddenly it\r\ndawned upon him that all this was an elaborate joke.  Mr Vladimir\r\nexhibited his white teeth in a smile, with dimples on his round, full\r\nface posed with a complacent inclination above the bristling bow of his\r\nneck-tie.  The favourite of intelligent society women had assumed his\r\ndrawing-room attitude accompanying the delivery of delicate witticisms.\r\nSitting well forward, his white hand upraised, he seemed to hold\r\ndelicately between his thumb and forefinger the subtlety of his\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere could be nothing better.  Such an outrage combines the greatest\r\npossible regard for humanity with the most alarming display of ferocious\r\nimbecility.  I defy the ingenuity of journalists to persuade their public\r\nthat any given member of the proletariat can have a personal grievance\r\nagainst astronomy.  Starvation itself could hardly be dragged in\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94eh?  And there are other advantages.  The whole civilised world has\r\nheard of Greenwich.  The very boot-blacks in the basement of Charing\r\nCross Station know something of it.  See?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe features of Mr Vladimir, so well known in the best society by their\r\nhumorous urbanity, beamed with cynical self-satisfaction, which would\r\nhave astonished the intelligent women his wit entertained so exquisitely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, with a contemptuous smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthe blowing up of the\r\nfirst meridian is bound to raise a howl of execration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA difficult business,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc mumbled, feeling that this was the only\r\nsafe thing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?  Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you the whole gang under your hand?  The\r\nvery pick of the basket?  That old terrorist Yundt is here.  I see him\r\nwalking about Piccadilly in his green havelock almost every day.  And\r\nMichaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow where he is?  Because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir\r\nwent on menacingly.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf you imagine that you are the only one on the\r\nsecret fund list, you are mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis perfectly gratuitous suggestion caused Mr Verloc to shuffle his feet\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the whole Lausanne lot\xe2\x80\x94eh?  Haven\xe2\x80\x99t they been flocking over here at\r\nthe first hint of the Milan Conference?  This is an absurd country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will cost money,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc said, by a sort of instinct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cock won\xe2\x80\x99t fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir retorted, with an amazingly genuine\r\nEnglish accent.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get your screw every month, and no more till\r\nsomething happens.  And if nothing happens very soon you won\xe2\x80\x99t get even\r\nthat.  What\xe2\x80\x99s your ostensible occupation?  What are you supposed to live\r\nby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI keep a shop,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr Verloc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA shop!  What sort of shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStationery, newspapers.  My wife\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour what?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr Vladimir in his guttural Central Asian tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr Verloc raised his husky voice slightly.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat be damned for a yarn,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other in unfeigned\r\nastonishment.  \xe2\x80\x9cMarried!  And you a professed anarchist, too!  What is\r\nthis confounded nonsense?  But I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s merely a manner of\r\nspeaking.  Anarchists don\xe2\x80\x99t marry.  It\xe2\x80\x99s well known.  They can\xe2\x80\x99t.  It\r\nwould be apostasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife isn\xe2\x80\x99t one,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc mumbled sulkily.  \xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, it\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nconcern of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, it is,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Mr Vladimir.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am beginning to be convinced\r\nthat you are not at all the man for the work you\xe2\x80\x99ve been employed on.\r\nWhy, you must have discredited yourself completely in your own world by\r\nyour marriage.  Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have managed without?  This is your virtuous\r\nattachment\xe2\x80\x94eh?  What with one sort of attachment and another you are\r\ndoing away with your usefulness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, puffing out his cheeks, let the air escape violently, and that\r\nwas all.  He had armed himself with patience.  It was not to be tried\r\nmuch longer.  The First Secretary became suddenly very curt, detached,\r\nfinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cA dynamite outrage must be provoked.  I give\r\nyou a month.  The sittings of the Conference are suspended.  Before it\r\nreassembles again something must have happened here, or your connection\r\nwith us ceases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe changed the note once more with an unprincipled versatility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink over my philosophy, Mr\xe2\x80\x94Mr\xe2\x80\x94Verloc,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sort of\r\nchaffing condescension, waving his hand towards the door.  \xe2\x80\x9cGo for the\r\nfirst meridian.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t know the middle classes as well as I do.\r\nTheir sensibilities are jaded.  The first meridian.  Nothing better, and\r\nnothing easier, I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had got up, and with his thin sensitive lips twitching humorously,\r\nwatched in the glass over the mantelpiece Mr Verloc backing out of the\r\nroom heavily, hat and stick in hand.  The door closed.\r\n\r\nThe footman in trousers, appearing suddenly in the corridor, let Mr\r\nVerloc another way out and through a small door in the corner of the\r\ncourtyard.  The porter standing at the gate ignored his exit completely;\r\nand Mr Verloc retraced the path of his morning\xe2\x80\x99s pilgrimage as if in a\r\ndream\xe2\x80\x94an angry dream.  This detachment from the material world was so\r\ncomplete that, though the mortal envelope of Mr Verloc had not hastened\r\nunduly along the streets, that part of him to which it would be\r\nunwarrantably rude to refuse immortality, found itself at the shop door\r\nall at once, as if borne from west to east on the wings of a great wind.\r\nHe walked straight behind the counter, and sat down on a wooden chair\r\nthat stood there.  No one appeared to disturb his solitude.  Stevie, put\r\ninto a green baize apron, was now sweeping and dusting upstairs, intent\r\nand conscientious, as though he were playing at it; and Mrs Verloc,\r\nwarned in the kitchen by the clatter of the cracked bell, had merely come\r\nto the glazed door of the parlour, and putting the curtain aside a\r\nlittle, had peered into the dim shop.  Seeing her husband sitting there\r\nshadowy and bulky, with his hat tilted far back on his head, she had at\r\nonce returned to her stove.  An hour or more later she took the green\r\nbaize apron off her brother Stevie, and instructed him to wash his hands\r\nand face in the peremptory tone she had used in that connection for\r\nfifteen years or so\xe2\x80\x94ever since she had, in fact, ceased to attend to the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s hands and face herself.  She spared presently a glance away from\r\nher dishing-up for the inspection of that face and those hands which\r\nStevie, approaching the kitchen table, offered for her approval with an\r\nair of self-assurance hiding a perpetual residue of anxiety.  Formerly\r\nthe anger of the father was the supremely effective sanction of these\r\nrites, but Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s placidity in domestic life would have made all\r\nmention of anger incredible even to poor Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s nervousness.  The\r\ntheory was that Mr Verloc would have been inexpressibly pained and\r\nshocked by any deficiency of cleanliness at meal times.  Winnie after the\r\ndeath of her father found considerable consolation in the feeling that\r\nshe need no longer tremble for poor Stevie.  She could not bear to see\r\nthe boy hurt.  It maddened her.  As a little girl she had often faced\r\nwith blazing eyes the irascible licensed victualler in defence of her\r\nbrother.  Nothing now in Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s appearance could lead one to\r\nsuppose that she was capable of a passionate demonstration.\r\n\r\nShe finished her dishing-up.  The table was laid in the parlour.  Going\r\nto the foot of the stairs, she screamed out \xe2\x80\x9cMother!\xe2\x80\x9d  Then opening the\r\nglazed door leading to the shop, she said quietly \xe2\x80\x9cAdolf!\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr Verloc had\r\nnot changed his position; he had not apparently stirred a limb for an\r\nhour and a half.  He got up heavily, and came to his dinner in his\r\novercoat and with his hat on, without uttering a word.  His silence in\r\nitself had nothing startlingly unusual in this household, hidden in the\r\nshades of the sordid street seldom touched by the sun, behind the dim\r\nshop with its wares of disreputable rubbish.  Only that day Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaciturnity was so obviously thoughtful that the two women were impressed\r\nby it.  They sat silent themselves, keeping a watchful eye on poor\r\nStevie, lest he should break out into one of his fits of loquacity.  He\r\nfaced Mr Verloc across the table, and remained very good and quiet,\r\nstaring vacantly.  The endeavour to keep him from making himself\r\nobjectionable in any way to the master of the house put no inconsiderable\r\nanxiety into these two women\xe2\x80\x99s lives.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat boy,\xe2\x80\x9d as they alluded to him\r\nsoftly between themselves, had been a source of that sort of anxiety\r\nalmost from the very day of his birth.  The late licensed victualler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhumiliation at having such a very peculiar boy for a son manifested\r\nitself by a propensity to brutal treatment; for he was a person of fine\r\nsensibilities, and his sufferings as a man and a father were perfectly\r\ngenuine.  Afterwards Stevie had to be kept from making himself a nuisance\r\nto the single gentlemen lodgers, who are themselves a queer lot, and are\r\neasily aggrieved.  And there was always the anxiety of his mere existence\r\nto face.  Visions of a workhouse infirmary for her child had haunted the\r\nold woman in the basement breakfast-room of the decayed Belgravian house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had not found such a good husband, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she used to say to\r\nher daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what would have become of that poor boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc extended as much recognition to Stevie as a man not\r\nparticularly fond of animals may give to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s beloved cat; and this\r\nrecognition, benevolent and perfunctory, was essentially of the same\r\nquality.  Both women admitted to themselves that not much more could be\r\nreasonably expected.  It was enough to earn for Mr Verloc the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreverential gratitude.  In the early days, made sceptical by the trials\r\nof friendless life, she used sometimes to ask anxiously: \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink, my dear, that Mr Verloc is getting tired of seeing Stevie about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTo this Winnie replied habitually by a slight toss of her head.  Once,\r\nhowever, she retorted, with a rather grim pertness: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get\r\ntired of me first.\xe2\x80\x9d  A long silence ensued.  The mother, with her feet\r\npropped up on a stool, seemed to be trying to get to the bottom of that\r\nanswer, whose feminine profundity had struck her all of a heap.  She had\r\nnever really understood why Winnie had married Mr Verloc.  It was very\r\nsensible of her, and evidently had turned out for the best, but her girl\r\nmight have naturally hoped to find somebody of a more suitable age.\r\nThere had been a steady young fellow, only son of a butcher in the next\r\nstreet, helping his father in business, with whom Winnie had been walking\r\nout with obvious gusto.  He was dependent on his father, it is true; but\r\nthe business was good, and his prospects excellent.  He took her girl to\r\nthe theatre on several evenings.  Then just as she began to dread to hear\r\nof their engagement (for what could she have done with that big house\r\nalone, with Stevie on her hands), that romance came to an abrupt end, and\r\nWinnie went about looking very dull.  But Mr Verloc, turning up\r\nprovidentially to occupy the first-floor front bedroom, there had been no\r\nmore question of the young butcher.  It was clearly providential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c . . . All idealisation makes life poorer.  To beautify it is to take\r\naway its character of complexity\xe2\x80\x94it is to destroy it.  Leave that to the\r\nmoralists, my boy.  History is made by men, but they do not make it in\r\ntheir heads.  The ideas that are born in their consciousness play an\r\ninsignificant part in the march of events.  History is dominated and\r\ndetermined by the tool and the production\xe2\x80\x94by the force of economic\r\nconditions.  Capitalism has made socialism, and the laws made by the\r\ncapitalism for the protection of property are responsible for anarchism.\r\nNo one can tell what form the social organisation may take in the future.\r\nThen why indulge in prophetic phantasies?  At best they can only\r\ninterpret the mind of the prophet, and can have no objective value.\r\nLeave that pastime to the moralists, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMichaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle, was speaking in an even voice, a\r\nvoice that wheezed as if deadened and oppressed by the layer of fat on\r\nhis chest.  He had come out of a highly hygienic prison round like a tub,\r\nwith an enormous stomach and distended cheeks of a pale, semi-transparent\r\ncomplexion, as though for fifteen years the servants of an outraged\r\nsociety had made a point of stuffing him with fattening foods in a damp\r\nand lightless cellar.  And ever since he had never managed to get his\r\nweight down as much as an ounce.\r\n\r\nIt was said that for three seasons running a very wealthy old lady had\r\nsent him for a cure to Marienbad\xe2\x80\x94where he was about to share the public\r\ncuriosity once with a crowned head\xe2\x80\x94but the police on that occasion\r\nordered him to leave within twelve hours.  His martyrdom was continued by\r\nforbidding him all access to the healing waters.  But he was resigned\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nWith his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint, but more like a bend\r\nin a dummy\xe2\x80\x99s limb, thrown over the back of a chair, he leaned forward\r\nslightly over his short and enormous thighs to spit into the grate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!  I had the time to think things out a little,\xe2\x80\x9d he added without\r\nemphasis.  \xe2\x80\x9cSociety has given me plenty of time for meditation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the fireplace, in the horse-hair arm-chair where Mrs\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother was generally privileged to sit, Karl Yundt giggled\r\ngrimly, with a faint black grimace of a toothless mouth.  The terrorist,\r\nas he called himself, was old and bald, with a narrow, snow-white wisp of\r\na goatee hanging limply from his chin.  An extraordinary expression of\r\nunderhand malevolence survived in his extinguished eyes.  When he rose\r\npainfully the thrusting forward of a skinny groping hand deformed by\r\ngouty swellings suggested the effort of a moribund murderer summoning all\r\nhis remaining strength for a last stab.  He leaned on a thick stick,\r\nwhich trembled under his other hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always dreamed,\xe2\x80\x9d he mouthed fiercely, \xe2\x80\x9cof a band of men absolute\r\nin their resolve to discard all scruples in the choice of means, strong\r\nenough to give themselves frankly the name of destroyers, and free from\r\nthe taint of that resigned pessimism which rots the world.  No pity for\r\nanything on earth, including themselves, and death enlisted for good and\r\nall in the service of humanity\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I would have liked to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis little bald head quivered, imparting a comical vibration to the wisp\r\nof white goatee.  His enunciation would have been almost totally\r\nunintelligible to a stranger.  His worn-out passion, resembling in its\r\nimpotent fierceness the excitement of a senile sensualist, was badly\r\nserved by a dried throat and toothless gums which seemed to catch the tip\r\nof his tongue.  Mr Verloc, established in the corner of the sofa at the\r\nother end of the room, emitted two hearty grunts of assent.\r\n\r\nThe old terrorist turned slowly his head on his skinny neck from side to\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I could never get as many as three such men together.  So much for\r\nyour rotten pessimism,\xe2\x80\x9d he snarled at Michaelis, who uncrossed his thick\r\nlegs, similar to bolsters, and slid his feet abruptly under his chair in\r\nsign of exasperation.\r\n\r\nHe a pessimist!  Preposterous!  He cried out that the charge was\r\noutrageous.  He was so far from pessimism that he saw already the end of\r\nall private property coming along logically, unavoidably, by the mere\r\ndevelopment of its inherent viciousness.  The possessors of property had\r\nnot only to face the awakened proletariat, but they had also to fight\r\namongst themselves.  Yes.  Struggle, warfare, was the condition of\r\nprivate ownership.  It was fatal.  Ah! he did not depend upon emotional\r\nexcitement to keep up his belief, no declamations, no anger, no visions\r\nof blood-red flags waving, or metaphorical lurid suns of vengeance rising\r\nabove the horizon of a doomed society.  Not he!  Cold reason, he boasted,\r\nwas the basis of his optimism.  Yes, optimism\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHis laborious wheezing stopped, then, after a gasp or two, he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think that, if I had not been the optimist I am, I could not\r\nhave found in fifteen years some means to cut my throat?  And, in the\r\nlast instance, there were always the walls of my cell to dash my head\r\nagainst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shortness of breath took all fire, all animation out of his voice;\r\nhis great, pale cheeks hung like filled pouches, motionless, without a\r\nquiver; but in his blue eyes, narrowed as if peering, there was the same\r\nlook of confident shrewdness, a little crazy in its fixity, they must\r\nhave had while the indomitable optimist sat thinking at night in his\r\ncell.  Before him, Karl Yundt remained standing, one wing of his faded\r\ngreenish havelock thrown back cavalierly over his shoulder.  Seated in\r\nfront of the fireplace, Comrade Ossipon, ex-medical student, the\r\nprincipal writer of the F. P. leaflets, stretched out his robust legs,\r\nkeeping the soles of his boots turned up to the glow in the grate.  A\r\nbush of crinkly yellow hair topped his red, freckled face, with a\r\nflattened nose and prominent mouth cast in the rough mould of the negro\r\ntype.  His almond-shaped eyes leered languidly over the high cheek-bones.\r\nHe wore a grey flannel shirt, the loose ends of a black silk tie hung\r\ndown the buttoned breast of his serge coat; and his head resting on the\r\nback of his chair, his throat largely exposed, he raised to his lips a\r\ncigarette in a long wooden tube, puffing jets of smoke straight up at the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nMichaelis pursued his idea\xe2\x80\x94_the_ idea of his solitary reclusion\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nthought vouchsafed to his captivity and growing like a faith revealed in\r\nvisions.  He talked to himself, indifferent to the sympathy or hostility\r\nof his hearers, indifferent indeed to their presence, from the habit he\r\nhad acquired of thinking aloud hopefully in the solitude of the four\r\nwhitewashed walls of his cell, in the sepulchral silence of the great\r\nblind pile of bricks near a river, sinister and ugly like a colossal\r\nmortuary for the socially drowned.\r\n\r\nHe was no good in discussion, not because any amount of argument could\r\nshake his faith, but because the mere fact of hearing another voice\r\ndisconcerted him painfully, confusing his thoughts at once\xe2\x80\x94these thoughts\r\nthat for so many years, in a mental solitude more barren than a waterless\r\ndesert, no living voice had ever combatted, commented, or approved.\r\n\r\nNo one interrupted him now, and he made again the confession of his\r\nfaith, mastering him irresistible and complete like an act of grace: the\r\nsecret of fate discovered in the material side of life; the economic\r\ncondition of the world responsible for the past and shaping the future;\r\nthe source of all history, of all ideas, guiding the mental development\r\nof mankind and the very impulses of their passion\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nA harsh laugh from Comrade Ossipon cut the tirade dead short in a sudden\r\nfaltering of the tongue and a bewildered unsteadiness of the apostle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmildly exalted eyes.  He closed them slowly for a moment, as if to\r\ncollect his routed thoughts.  A silence fell; but what with the two\r\ngas-jets over the table and the glowing grate the little parlour behind\r\nMr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s shop had become frightfully hot.  Mr Verloc, getting off the\r\nsofa with ponderous reluctance, opened the door leading into the kitchen\r\nto get more air, and thus disclosed the innocent Stevie, seated very good\r\nand quiet at a deal table, drawing circles, circles, circles; innumerable\r\ncircles, concentric, eccentric; a coruscating whirl of circles that by\r\ntheir tangled multitude of repeated curves, uniformity of form, and\r\nconfusion of intersecting lines suggested a rendering of cosmic chaos,\r\nthe symbolism of a mad art attempting the inconceivable.  The artist\r\nnever turned his head; and in all his soul\xe2\x80\x99s application to the task his\r\nback quivered, his thin neck, sunk into a deep hollow at the base of the\r\nskull, seemed ready to snap.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, after a grunt of disapproving surprise, returned to the sofa.\r\nAlexander Ossipon got up, tall in his threadbare blue serge suit under\r\nthe low ceiling, shook off the stiffness of long immobility, and strolled\r\naway into the kitchen (down two steps) to look over Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\nHe came back, pronouncing oracularly: \xe2\x80\x9cVery good.  Very characteristic,\r\nperfectly typical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s very good?\xe2\x80\x9d grunted inquiringly Mr Verloc, settled again in the\r\ncorner of the sofa.  The other explained his meaning negligently, with a\r\nshade of condescension and a toss of his head towards the kitchen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTypical of this form of degeneracy\xe2\x80\x94these drawings, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would call that lad a degenerate, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Mr Verloc.\r\n\r\nComrade Alexander Ossipon\xe2\x80\x94nicknamed the Doctor, ex-medical student\r\nwithout a degree; afterwards wandering lecturer to working-men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassociations upon the socialistic aspects of hygiene; author of a popular\r\nquasi-medical study (in the form of a cheap pamphlet seized promptly by\r\nthe police) entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Corroding Vices of the Middle Classes\xe2\x80\x9d; special\r\ndelegate of the more or less mysterious Red Committee, together with Karl\r\nYundt and Michaelis for the work of literary propaganda\xe2\x80\x94turned upon the\r\nobscure familiar of at least two Embassies that glance of insufferable,\r\nhopelessly dense sufficiency which nothing but the frequentation of\r\nscience can give to the dulness of common mortals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what he may be called scientifically.  Very good type too,\r\naltogether, of that sort of degenerate.  It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to glance at the\r\nlobes of his ears.  If you read Lombroso\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, moody and spread largely on the sofa, continued to look down\r\nthe row of his waistcoat buttons; but his cheeks became tinged by a faint\r\nblush.  Of late even the merest derivative of the word science (a term in\r\nitself inoffensive and of indefinite meaning) had the curious power of\r\nevoking a definitely offensive mental vision of Mr Vladimir, in his body\r\nas he lived, with an almost supernatural clearness.  And this phenomenon,\r\ndeserving justly to be classed amongst the marvels of science, induced in\r\nMr Verloc an emotional state of dread and exasperation tending to express\r\nitself in violent swearing.  But he said nothing.  It was Karl Yundt who\r\nwas heard, implacable to his last breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLombroso is an ass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nComrade Ossipon met the shock of this blasphemy by an awful, vacant\r\nstare.  And the other, his extinguished eyes without gleams blackening\r\nthe deep shadows under the great, bony forehead, mumbled, catching the\r\ntip of his tongue between his lips at every second word as though he were\r\nchewing it angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see such an idiot?  For him the criminal is the prisoner.\r\nSimple, is it not?  What about those who shut him up there\xe2\x80\x94forced him in\r\nthere?  Exactly.  Forced him in there.  And what is crime?  Does he know\r\nthat, this imbecile who has made his way in this world of gorged fools by\r\nlooking at the ears and teeth of a lot of poor, luckless devils?  Teeth\r\nand ears mark the criminal?  Do they?  And what about the law that marks\r\nhim still better\xe2\x80\x94the pretty branding instrument invented by the overfed\r\nto protect themselves against the hungry?  Red-hot applications on their\r\nvile skins\xe2\x80\x94hey?  Can\xe2\x80\x99t you smell and hear from here the thick hide of the\r\npeople burn and sizzle?  That\xe2\x80\x99s how criminals are made for your Lombrosos\r\nto write their silly stuff about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe knob of his stick and his legs shook together with passion, whilst\r\nthe trunk, draped in the wings of the havelock, preserved his historic\r\nattitude of defiance.  He seemed to sniff the tainted air of social\r\ncruelty, to strain his ear for its atrocious sounds.  There was an\r\nextraordinary force of suggestion in this posturing.  The all but\r\nmoribund veteran of dynamite wars had been a great actor in his\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94actor on platforms, in secret assemblies, in private interviews.\r\nThe famous terrorist had never in his life raised personally as much as\r\nhis little finger against the social edifice.  He was no man of action;\r\nhe was not even an orator of torrential eloquence, sweeping the masses\r\nalong in the rushing noise and foam of a great enthusiasm.  With a more\r\nsubtle intention, he took the part of an insolent and venomous evoker of\r\nsinister impulses which lurk in the blind envy and exasperated vanity of\r\nignorance, in the suffering and misery of poverty, in all the hopeful and\r\nnoble illusions of righteous anger, pity, and revolt.  The shadow of his\r\nevil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial\r\nof poison, emptied now, useless, ready to be thrown away upon the\r\nrubbish-heap of things that had served their time.\r\n\r\nMichaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle, smiled vaguely with his glued\r\nlips; his pasty moon face drooped under the weight of melancholy assent.\r\nHe had been a prisoner himself.  His own skin had sizzled under the\r\nred-hot brand, he murmured softly.  But Comrade Ossipon, nicknamed the\r\nDoctor, had got over the shock by that time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he began disdainfully, but stopped short,\r\nintimidated by the dead blackness of the cavernous eyes in the face\r\nturned slowly towards him with a blind stare, as if guided only by the\r\nsound.  He gave the discussion up, with a slight shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\nStevie, accustomed to move about disregarded, had got up from the kitchen\r\ntable, carrying off his drawing to bed with him.  He had reached the\r\nparlour door in time to receive in full the shock of Karl Yundt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neloquent imagery.  The sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of\r\nhis fingers, and he remained staring at the old terrorist, as if rooted\r\nsuddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain.\r\nStevie knew very well that hot iron applied to one\xe2\x80\x99s skin hurt very much.\r\nHis scared eyes blazed with indignation: it would hurt terribly.  His\r\nmouth dropped open.\r\n\r\nMichaelis by staring unwinkingly at the fire had regained that sentiment\r\nof isolation necessary for the continuity of his thought.  His optimism\r\nhad begun to flow from his lips.  He saw Capitalism doomed in its cradle,\r\nborn with the poison of the principle of competition in its system.  The\r\ngreat capitalists devouring the little capitalists, concentrating the\r\npower and the tools of production in great masses, perfecting industrial\r\nprocesses, and in the madness of self-aggrandisement only preparing,\r\norganising, enriching, making ready the lawful inheritance of the\r\nsuffering proletariat.  Michaelis pronounced the great word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and his clear blue glance, raised to the low ceiling of Mr\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s parlour, had a character of seraphic trustfulness.  In the\r\ndoorway Stevie, calmed, seemed sunk in hebetude.\r\n\r\nComrade Ossipon\xe2\x80\x99s face twitched with exasperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s no use doing anything\xe2\x80\x94no use whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Michaelis gently.  His vision of truth had\r\ngrown so intense that the sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this\r\ntime.  He continued to look down at the red coals.  Preparation for the\r\nfuture was necessary, and he was willing to admit that the great change\r\nwould perhaps come in the upheaval of a revolution.  But he argued that\r\nrevolutionary propaganda was a delicate work of high conscience.  It was\r\nthe education of the masters of the world.  It should be as careful as\r\nthe education given to kings.  He would have it advance its tenets\r\ncautiously, even timidly, in our ignorance of the effect that may be\r\nproduced by any given economic change upon the happiness, the morals, the\r\nintellect, the history of mankind.  For history is made with tools, not\r\nwith ideas; and everything is changed by economic conditions\xe2\x80\x94art,\r\nphilosophy, love, virtue\xe2\x80\x94truth itself!\r\n\r\nThe coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash; and Michaelis,\r\nthe hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary, got up\r\nimpetuously.  Round like a distended balloon, he opened his short, thick\r\narms, as if in a pathetically hopeless attempt to embrace and hug to his\r\nbreast a self-regenerated universe.  He gasped with ardour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe future is as certain as the past\xe2\x80\x94slavery, feudalism, individualism,\r\ncollectivism.  This is the statement of a law, not an empty prophecy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe disdainful pout of Comrade Ossipon\xe2\x80\x99s thick lips accentuated the negro\r\ntype of his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he said calmly enough.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no law and no certainty.\r\nThe teaching propaganda be hanged.  What the people knows does not\r\nmatter, were its knowledge ever so accurate.  The only thing that matters\r\nto us is the emotional state of the masses.  Without emotion there is no\r\naction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, then added with modest firmness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am speaking now to you scientifically\xe2\x80\x94scientifically\xe2\x80\x94Eh?  What did you\r\nsay, Verloc?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d growled from the sofa Mr Verloc, who, provoked by the\r\nabhorrent sound, had merely muttered a \xe2\x80\x9cDamn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe venomous spluttering of the old terrorist without teeth was heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how I would call the nature of the present economic\r\nconditions?  I would call it cannibalistic.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is!  They are\r\nnourishing their greed on the quivering flesh and the warm blood of the\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStevie swallowed the terrifying statement with an audible gulp, and at\r\nonce, as though it had been swift poison, sank limply in a sitting\r\nposture on the steps of the kitchen door.\r\n\r\nMichaelis gave no sign of having heard anything.  His lips seemed glued\r\ntogether for good; not a quiver passed over his heavy cheeks.  With\r\ntroubled eyes he looked for his round, hard hat, and put it on his round\r\nhead.  His round and obese body seemed to float low between the chairs\r\nunder the sharp elbow of Karl Yundt.  The old terrorist, raising an\r\nuncertain and clawlike hand, gave a swaggering tilt to a black felt\r\nsombrero shading the hollows and ridges of his wasted face.  He got in\r\nmotion slowly, striking the floor with his stick at every step.  It was\r\nrather an affair to get him out of the house because, now and then, he\r\nwould stop, as if to think, and did not offer to move again till impelled\r\nforward by Michaelis.  The gentle apostle grasped his arm with brotherly\r\ncare; and behind them, his hands in his pockets, the robust Ossipon\r\nyawned vaguely.  A blue cap with a patent leather peak set well at the\r\nback of his yellow bush of hair gave him the aspect of a Norwegian sailor\r\nbored with the world after a thundering spree.  Mr Verloc saw his guests\r\noff the premises, attending them bareheaded, his heavy overcoat hanging\r\nopen, his eyes on the ground.\r\n\r\nHe closed the door behind their backs with restrained violence, turned\r\nthe key, shot the bolt.  He was not satisfied with his friends.  In the\r\nlight of Mr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy of bomb throwing they appeared\r\nhopelessly futile.  The part of Mr Verloc in revolutionary politics\r\nhaving been to observe, he could not all at once, either in his own home\r\nor in larger assemblies, take the initiative of action.  He had to be\r\ncautious.  Moved by the just indignation of a man well over forty,\r\nmenaced in what is dearest to him\xe2\x80\x94his repose and his security\xe2\x80\x94he asked\r\nhimself scornfully what else could have been expected from such a lot,\r\nthis Karl Yundt, this Michaelis\xe2\x80\x94this Ossipon.\r\n\r\nPausing in his intention to turn off the gas burning in the middle of the\r\nshop, Mr Verloc descended into the abyss of moral reflections.  With the\r\ninsight of a kindred temperament he pronounced his verdict.  A lazy\r\nlot\xe2\x80\x94this Karl Yundt, nursed by a blear-eyed old woman, a woman he had\r\nyears ago enticed away from a friend, and afterwards had tried more than\r\nonce to shake off into the gutter.  Jolly lucky for Yundt that she had\r\npersisted in coming up time after time, or else there would have been no\r\none now to help him out of the \xe2\x80\x99bus by the Green Park railings, where\r\nthat spectre took its constitutional crawl every fine morning.  When that\r\nindomitable snarling old witch died the swaggering spectre would have to\r\nvanish too\xe2\x80\x94there would be an end to fiery Karl Yundt.  And Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmorality was offended also by the optimism of Michaelis, annexed by his\r\nwealthy old lady, who had taken lately to sending him to a cottage she\r\nhad in the country.  The ex-prisoner could moon about the shady lanes for\r\ndays together in a delicious and humanitarian idleness.  As to Ossipon,\r\nthat beggar was sure to want for nothing as long as there were silly\r\ngirls with savings-bank books in the world.  And Mr Verloc,\r\ntemperamentally identical with his associates, drew fine distinctions in\r\nhis mind on the strength of insignificant differences.  He drew them with\r\na certain complacency, because the instinct of conventional\r\nrespectability was strong within him, being only overcome by his dislike\r\nof all kinds of recognised labour\xe2\x80\x94a temperamental defect which he shared\r\nwith a large proportion of revolutionary reformers of a given social\r\nstate.  For obviously one does not revolt against the advantages and\r\nopportunities of that state, but against the price which must be paid for\r\nthe same in the coin of accepted morality, self-restraint, and toil.  The\r\nmajority of revolutionists are the enemies of discipline and fatigue\r\nmostly.  There are natures too, to whose sense of justice the price\r\nexacted looms up monstrously enormous, odious, oppressive, worrying,\r\nhumiliating, extortionate, intolerable.  Those are the fanatics.  The\r\nremaining portion of social rebels is accounted for by vanity, the mother\r\nof all noble and vile illusions, the companion of poets, reformers,\r\ncharlatans, prophets, and incendiaries.\r\n\r\nLost for a whole minute in the abyss of meditation, Mr Verloc did not\r\nreach the depth of these abstract considerations.  Perhaps he was not\r\nable.  In any case he had not the time.  He was pulled up painfully by\r\nthe sudden recollection of Mr Vladimir, another of his associates, whom\r\nin virtue of subtle moral affinities he was capable of judging correctly.\r\nHe considered him as dangerous.  A shade of envy crept into his thoughts.\r\nLoafing was all very well for these fellows, who knew not Mr Vladimir,\r\nand had women to fall back upon; whereas he had a woman to provide for\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAt this point, by a simple association of ideas, Mr Verloc was brought\r\nface to face with the necessity of going to bed some time or other that\r\nevening.  Then why not go now\xe2\x80\x94at once?  He sighed.  The necessity was not\r\nso normally pleasurable as it ought to have been for a man of his age and\r\ntemperament.  He dreaded the demon of sleeplessness, which he felt had\r\nmarked him for its own.  He raised his arm, and turned off the flaring\r\ngas-jet above his head.\r\n\r\nA bright band of light fell through the parlour door into the part of the\r\nshop behind the counter.  It enabled Mr Verloc to ascertain at a glance\r\nthe number of silver coins in the till.  These were but few; and for the\r\nfirst time since he opened his shop he took a commercial survey of its\r\nvalue.  This survey was unfavourable.  He had gone into trade for no\r\ncommercial reasons.  He had been guided in the selection of this peculiar\r\nline of business by an instinctive leaning towards shady transactions,\r\nwhere money is picked up easily.  Moreover, it did not take him out of\r\nhis own sphere\xe2\x80\x94the sphere which is watched by the police.  On the\r\ncontrary, it gave him a publicly confessed standing in that sphere, and\r\nas Mr Verloc had unconfessed relations which made him familiar with yet\r\ncareless of the police, there was a distinct advantage in such a\r\nsituation.  But as a means of livelihood it was by itself insufficient.\r\n\r\nHe took the cash-box out of the drawer, and turning to leave the shop,\r\nbecame aware that Stevie was still downstairs.\r\n\r\nWhat on earth is he doing there?  Mr Verloc asked himself.  What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmeaning of these antics?  He looked dubiously at his brother-in-law, but\r\nhe did not ask him for information.  Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s intercourse with Stevie\r\nwas limited to the casual mutter of a morning, after breakfast, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nboots,\xe2\x80\x9d and even that was more a communication at large of a need than a\r\ndirect order or request.  Mr Verloc perceived with some surprise that he\r\ndid not know really what to say to Stevie.  He stood still in the middle\r\nof the parlour, and looked into the kitchen in silence.  Nor yet did he\r\nknow what would happen if he did say anything.  And this appeared very\r\nqueer to Mr Verloc in view of the fact, borne upon him suddenly, that he\r\nhad to provide for this fellow too.  He had never given a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthought till then to that aspect of Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s existence.\r\n\r\nPositively he did not know how to speak to the lad.  He watched him\r\ngesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen.  Stevie prowled round the\r\ntable like an excited animal in a cage.  A tentative \xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better\r\ngo to bed now?\xe2\x80\x9d produced no effect whatever; and Mr Verloc, abandoning\r\nthe stony contemplation of his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour, crossed the\r\nparlour wearily, cash-box in hand.  The cause of the general lassitude he\r\nfelt while climbing the stairs being purely mental, he became alarmed by\r\nits inexplicable character.  He hoped he was not sickening for anything.\r\nHe stopped on the dark landing to examine his sensations.  But a slight\r\nand continuous sound of snoring pervading the obscurity interfered with\r\ntheir clearness.  The sound came from his mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s room.  Another\r\none to provide for, he thought\xe2\x80\x94and on this thought walked into the\r\nbedroom.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc had fallen asleep with the lamp (no gas was laid upstairs)\r\nturned up full on the table by the side of the bed.  The light thrown\r\ndown by the shade fell dazzlingly on the white pillow sunk by the weight\r\nof her head reposing with closed eyes and dark hair done up in several\r\nplaits for the night.  She woke up with the sound of her name in her\r\nears, and saw her husband standing over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWinnie!  Winnie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first she did not stir, lying very quiet and looking at the cash-box\r\nin Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s hand.  But when she understood that her brother was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccapering all over the place downstairs\xe2\x80\x9d she swung out in one sudden\r\nmovement on to the edge of the bed.  Her bare feet, as if poked through\r\nthe bottom of an unadorned, sleeved calico sack buttoned tightly at neck\r\nand wrists, felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward\r\ninto her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to manage him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc explained peevishly.  \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo to leave him downstairs alone with the lights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, glided across the room swiftly, and the door closed\r\nupon her white form.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc deposited the cash-box on the night table, and began the\r\noperation of undressing by flinging his overcoat on to a distant chair.\r\nHis coat and waistcoat followed.  He walked about the room in his\r\nstockinged feet, and his burly figure, with the hands worrying nervously\r\nat his throat, passed and repassed across the long strip of looking-glass\r\nin the door of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe.  Then after slipping his braces off\r\nhis shoulders he pulled up violently the venetian blind, and leaned his\r\nforehead against the cold window-pane\xe2\x80\x94a fragile film of glass stretched\r\nbetween him and the enormity of cold, black, wet, muddy, inhospitable\r\naccumulation of bricks, slates, and stones, things in themselves unlovely\r\nand unfriendly to man.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc felt the latent unfriendliness of all out of doors with a force\r\napproaching to positive bodily anguish.  There is no occupation that\r\nfails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police.  It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike your horse suddenly falling dead under you in the midst of an\r\nuninhabited and thirsty plain.  The comparison occurred to Mr Verloc\r\nbecause he had sat astride various army horses in his time, and had now\r\nthe sensation of an incipient fall.  The prospect was as black as the\r\nwindow-pane against which he was leaning his forehead.  And suddenly the\r\nface of Mr Vladimir, clean-shaved and witty, appeared enhaloed in the\r\nglow of its rosy complexion like a sort of pink seal, impressed on the\r\nfatal darkness.\r\n\r\nThis luminous and mutilated vision was so ghastly physically that Mr\r\nVerloc started away from the window, letting down the venetian blind with\r\na great rattle.  Discomposed and speechless with the apprehension of more\r\nsuch visions, he beheld his wife re-enter the room and get into bed in a\r\ncalm business-like manner which made him feel hopelessly lonely in the\r\nworld.  Mrs Verloc expressed her surprise at seeing him up yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, passing his hands over his moist\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiddiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  Not at all well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, with all the placidity of an experienced wife, expressed a\r\nconfident opinion as to the cause, and suggested the usual remedies; but\r\nher husband, rooted in the middle of the room, shook his lowered head\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll catch cold standing there,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc made an effort, finished undressing, and got into bed.  Down\r\nbelow in the quiet, narrow street measured footsteps approached the\r\nhouse, then died away unhurried and firm, as if the passer-by had started\r\nto pace out all eternity, from gas-lamp to gas-lamp in a night without\r\nend; and the drowsy ticking of the old clock on the landing became\r\ndistinctly audible in the bedroom.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, on her back, and staring at the ceiling, made a remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTakings very small to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, in the same position, cleared his throat as if for an\r\nimportant statement, but merely inquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you turn off the gas downstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I did,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs Verloc conscientiously.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat poor boy is in\r\na very excited state to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, after a pause which lasted\r\nfor three ticks of the clock.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc cared nothing for Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s excitement, but he felt horribly\r\nwakeful, and dreaded facing the darkness and silence that would follow\r\nthe extinguishing of the lamp.  This dread led him to make the remark\r\nthat Stevie had disregarded his suggestion to go to bed.  Mrs Verloc,\r\nfalling into the trap, started to demonstrate at length to her husband\r\nthat this was not \xe2\x80\x9cimpudence\xe2\x80\x9d of any sort, but simply \xe2\x80\x9cexcitement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere was no young man of his age in London more willing and docile than\r\nStephen, she affirmed; none more affectionate and ready to please, and\r\neven useful, as long as people did not upset his poor head.  Mrs Verloc,\r\nturning towards her recumbent husband, raised herself on her elbow, and\r\nhung over him in her anxiety that he should believe Stevie to be a useful\r\nmember of the family.  That ardour of protecting compassion exalted\r\nmorbidly in her childhood by the misery of another child tinged her\r\nsallow cheeks with a faint dusky blush, made her big eyes gleam under the\r\ndark lids.  Mrs Verloc then looked younger; she looked as young as Winnie\r\nused to look, and much more animated than the Winnie of the Belgravian\r\nmansion days had ever allowed herself to appear to gentlemen lodgers.  Mr\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties had prevented him from attaching any sense to what his\r\nwife was saying.  It was as if her voice were talking on the other side\r\nof a very thick wall.  It was her aspect that recalled him to himself.\r\n\r\nHe appreciated this woman, and the sentiment of this appreciation,\r\nstirred by a display of something resembling emotion, only added another\r\npang to his mental anguish.  When her voice ceased he moved uneasily, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been feeling well for the last few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe might have meant this as an opening to a complete confidence; but Mrs\r\nVerloc laid her head on the pillow again, and staring upward, went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat boy hears too much of what is talked about here.  If I had known\r\nthey were coming to-night I would have seen to it that he went to bed at\r\nthe same time I did.  He was out of his mind with something he overheard\r\nabout eating people\xe2\x80\x99s flesh and drinking blood.  What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of\r\ntalking like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a note of indignant scorn in her voice.  Mr Verloc was fully\r\nresponsive now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Karl Yundt,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled savagely.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, with great decision, pronounced Karl Yundt \xe2\x80\x9ca disgusting old\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d  She declared openly her affection for Michaelis.  Of the robust\r\nOssipon, in whose presence she always felt uneasy behind an attitude of\r\nstony reserve, she said nothing whatever.  And continuing to talk of that\r\nbrother, who had been for so many years an object of care and fears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t fit to hear what\xe2\x80\x99s said here.  He believes it\xe2\x80\x99s all true.  He\r\nknows no better.  He gets into his passions over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc made no comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe glared at me, as if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who I was, when I went downstairs.\r\nHis heart was going like a hammer.  He can\xe2\x80\x99t help being excitable.  I\r\nwoke mother up, and asked her to sit with him till he went to sleep.  It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t his fault.  He\xe2\x80\x99s no trouble when he\xe2\x80\x99s left alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc made no comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish he had never been to school,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc began again brusquely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s always taking away those newspapers from the window to read.  He\r\ngets a red face poring over them.  We don\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of a dozen numbers in\r\na month.  They only take up room in the front window.  And Mr Ossipon\r\nbrings every week a pile of these F. P. tracts to sell at a halfpenny\r\neach.  I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a halfpenny for the whole lot.  It\xe2\x80\x99s silly\r\nreading\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.  There\xe2\x80\x99s no sale for it.  The other day Stevie\r\ngot hold of one, and there was a story in it of a German soldier officer\r\ntearing half-off the ear of a recruit, and nothing was done to him for\r\nit.  The brute!  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything with Stevie that afternoon.  The\r\nstory was enough, too, to make one\xe2\x80\x99s blood boil.  But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of\r\nprinting things like that?  We aren\xe2\x80\x99t German slaves here, thank God.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not our business\xe2\x80\x94is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to take the carving knife from the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc continued, a\r\nlittle sleepily now.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe was shouting and stamping and sobbing.  He\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stand the notion of any cruelty.  He would have stuck that officer\r\nlike a pig if he had seen him then.  It\xe2\x80\x99s true, too!  Some people don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeserve much mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s voice ceased, and the expression of\r\nher motionless eyes became more and more contemplative and veiled during\r\nthe long pause.  \xe2\x80\x9cComfortable, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a faint, far-away\r\nvoice.  \xe2\x80\x9cShall I put out the light now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dreary conviction that there was no sleep for him held Mr Verloc mute\r\nand hopelessly inert in his fear of darkness.  He made a great effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  Put it out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last in a hollow tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the thirty or so little tables covered by red cloths with a white\r\ndesign stood ranged at right angles to the deep brown wainscoting of the\r\nunderground hall.  Bronze chandeliers with many globes depended from the\r\nlow, slightly vaulted ceiling, and the fresco paintings ran flat and dull\r\nall round the walls without windows, representing scenes of the chase and\r\nof outdoor revelry in medi\xc3\xa6val costumes.  Varlets in green jerkins\r\nbrandished hunting knives and raised on high tankards of foaming beer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless I am very much mistaken, you are the man who would know the\r\ninside of this confounded affair,\xe2\x80\x9d said the robust Ossipon, leaning over,\r\nhis elbows far out on the table and his feet tucked back completely under\r\nhis chair.  His eyes stared with wild eagerness.\r\n\r\nAn upright semi-grand piano near the door, flanked by two palms in pots,\r\nexecuted suddenly all by itself a valse tune with aggressive virtuosity.\r\nThe din it raised was deafening.  When it ceased, as abruptly as it had\r\nstarted, the be-spectacled, dingy little man who faced Ossipon behind a\r\nheavy glass mug full of beer emitted calmly what had the sound of a\r\ngeneral proposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn principle what one of us may or may not know as to any given fact\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be a matter for inquiry to the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d Comrade Ossipon agreed in a quiet undertone.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nprinciple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith his big florid face held between his hands he continued to stare\r\nhard, while the dingy little man in spectacles coolly took a drink of\r\nbeer and stood the glass mug back on the table.  His flat, large ears\r\ndeparted widely from the sides of his skull, which looked frail enough\r\nfor Ossipon to crush between thumb and forefinger; the dome of the\r\nforehead seemed to rest on the rim of the spectacles; the flat cheeks, of\r\na greasy, unhealthy complexion, were merely smudged by the miserable\r\npoverty of a thin dark whisker.  The lamentable inferiority of the whole\r\nphysique was made ludicrous by the supremely self-confident bearing of\r\nthe individual.  His speech was curt, and he had a particularly\r\nimpressive manner of keeping silent.\r\n\r\nOssipon spoke again from between his hands in a mutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been out much to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  I stayed in bed all the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  Nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon, gazing earnestly and quivering inwardly\r\nwith the desire to find out something, but obviously intimidated by the\r\nlittle man\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming air of unconcern.  When talking with this\r\ncomrade\xe2\x80\x94which happened but rarely\xe2\x80\x94the big Ossipon suffered from a sense\r\nof moral and even physical insignificance.  However, he ventured another\r\nquestion.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid you walk down here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; omnibus,\xe2\x80\x9d the little man answered readily enough.  He lived far away\r\nin Islington, in a small house down a shabby street, littered with straw\r\nand dirty paper, where out of school hours a troop of assorted children\r\nran and squabbled with a shrill, joyless, rowdy clamour.  His single back\r\nroom, remarkable for having an extremely large cupboard, he rented\r\nfurnished from two elderly spinsters, dressmakers in a humble way with a\r\nclientele of servant girls mostly.  He had a heavy padlock put on the\r\ncupboard, but otherwise he was a model lodger, giving no trouble, and\r\nrequiring practically no attendance.  His oddities were that he insisted\r\non being present when his room was being swept, and that when he went out\r\nhe locked his door, and took the key away with him.\r\n\r\nOssipon had a vision of these round black-rimmed spectacles progressing\r\nalong the streets on the top of an omnibus, their self-confident glitter\r\nfalling here and there on the walls of houses or lowered upon the heads\r\nof the unconscious stream of people on the pavements.  The ghost of a\r\nsickly smile altered the set of Ossipon\xe2\x80\x99s thick lips at the thought of\r\nthe walls nodding, of people running for life at the sight of those\r\nspectacles.  If they had only known!  What a panic!  He murmured\r\ninterrogatively: \xe2\x80\x9cBeen sitting long here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour or more,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other negligently, and took a pull at the\r\ndark beer.  All his movements\xe2\x80\x94the way he grasped the mug, the act of\r\ndrinking, the way he set the heavy glass down and folded his arms\xe2\x80\x94had a\r\nfirmness, an assured precision which made the big and muscular Ossipon,\r\nleaning forward with staring eyes and protruding lips, look the picture\r\nof eager indecision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThen it may be you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard yet the news I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheard just now\xe2\x80\x94in the street.  Have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little man shook his head negatively the least bit.  But as he gave\r\nno indication of curiosity Ossipon ventured to add that he had heard it\r\njust outside the place.  A newspaper boy had yelled the thing under his\r\nvery nose, and not being prepared for anything of that sort, he was very\r\nmuch startled and upset.  He had to come in there with a dry mouth.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever thought of finding you here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, murmuring steadily, with\r\nhis elbows planted on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come here sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, preserving his provoking\r\ncoolness of demeanour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful that you of all people should have heard nothing of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe big Ossipon continued.  His eyelids snapped nervously upon the\r\nshining eyes.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou of all people,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated tentatively.  This\r\nobvious restraint argued an incredible and inexplicable timidity of the\r\nbig fellow before the calm little man, who again lifted the glass mug,\r\ndrank, and put it down with brusque and assured movements.  And that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOssipon after waiting for something, word or sign, that did not come,\r\nmade an effort to assume a sort of indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, deadening his voice still more, \xe2\x80\x9cgive your stuff to\r\nanybody who\xe2\x80\x99s up to asking you for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy absolute rule is never to refuse anybody\xe2\x80\x94as long as I have a pinch by\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the little man with decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a principle?\xe2\x80\x9d commented Ossipon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a principle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you think it\xe2\x80\x99s sound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe large round spectacles, which gave a look of staring self-confidence\r\nto the sallow face, confronted Ossipon like sleepless, unwinking orbs\r\nflashing a cold fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly.  Always.  Under every circumstance.  What could stop me?  Why\r\nshould I not?  Why should I think twice about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon gasped, as it were, discreetly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you would hand it over to a \xe2\x80\x98teck\xe2\x80\x99 if one came to ask\r\nyou for your wares?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them come and try it on, and you will see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey know me,\r\nbut I know also every one of them.  They won\xe2\x80\x99t come near me\xe2\x80\x94not they.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis thin livid lips snapped together firmly.  Ossipon began to argue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they could send someone\xe2\x80\x94rig a plant on you.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?  Get the\r\nstuff from you in that way, and then arrest you with the proof in their\r\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProof of what?  Dealing in explosives without a licence perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d  This\r\nwas meant for a contemptuous jeer, though the expression of the thin,\r\nsickly face remained unchanged, and the utterance was negligent.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s one of them anxious to make that arrest.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink they could get one of them to apply for a warrant.  I mean one of\r\nthe best.  Not one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d Ossipon asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they know very well I take care never to part with the last\r\nhandful of my wares.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve it always by me.\xe2\x80\x9d  He touched the breast of\r\nhis coat lightly.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn a thick glass flask,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I have been told,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon, with a shade of wonder in his voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey know,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the little man crisply, leaning against the\r\nstraight chair back, which rose higher than his fragile head.  \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nnever be arrested.  The game isn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for any policeman of them\r\nall.  To deal with a man like me you require sheer, naked, inglorious\r\nheroism.\xe2\x80\x9d  Again his lips closed with a self-confident snap.  Ossipon\r\nrepressed a movement of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr recklessness\xe2\x80\x94or simply ignorance,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve only to get\r\nsomebody for the job who does not know you carry enough stuff in your\r\npocket to blow yourself and everything within sixty yards of you to\r\npieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never affirmed I could not be eliminated,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the other.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be an arrest.  Moreover, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so easy as it looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d Ossipon contradicted.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure of that.  What\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nprevent half-a-dozen of them jumping upon you from behind in the street?\r\nWith your arms pinned to your sides you could do nothing\xe2\x80\x94could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I could.  I am seldom out in the streets after dark,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlittle man impassively, \xe2\x80\x9cand never very late.  I walk always with my\r\nright hand closed round the india-rubber ball which I have in my trouser\r\npocket.  The pressing of this ball actuates a detonator inside the flask\r\nI carry in my pocket.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the principle of the pneumatic instantaneous\r\nshutter for a camera lens.  The tube leads up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a swift disclosing gesture he gave Ossipon a glimpse of an\r\nindia-rubber tube, resembling a slender brown worm, issuing from the\r\narmhole of his waistcoat and plunging into the inner breast pocket of his\r\njacket.  His clothes, of a nondescript brown mixture, were threadbare and\r\nmarked with stains, dusty in the folds, with ragged button-holes.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ndetonator is partly mechanical, partly chemical,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, with\r\ncasual condescension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is instantaneous, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Ossipon, with a slight\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar from it,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed the other, with a reluctance which seemed to\r\ntwist his mouth dolorously.  \xe2\x80\x9cA full twenty seconds must elapse from the\r\nmoment I press the ball till the explosion takes place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhew!\xe2\x80\x9d whistled Ossipon, completely appalled.  \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty seconds!\r\nHorrors!  You mean to say that you could face that?  I should go crazy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you did.  Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s the weak point of this\r\nspecial system, which is only for my own use.  The worst is that the\r\nmanner of exploding is always the weak point with us.  I am trying to\r\ninvent a detonator that would adjust itself to all conditions of action,\r\nand even to unexpected changes of conditions.  A variable and yet\r\nperfectly precise mechanism.  A really intelligent detonator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty seconds,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Ossipon again.  \xe2\x80\x9cOugh!  And then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a slight turn of the head the glitter of the spectacles seemed to\r\ngauge the size of the beer saloon in the basement of the renowned Silenus\r\nRestaurant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody in this room could hope to escape,\xe2\x80\x9d was the verdict of that\r\nsurvey.  \xe2\x80\x9cNor yet this couple going up the stairs now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe piano at the foot of the staircase clanged through a mazurka with\r\nbrazen impetuosity, as though a vulgar and impudent ghost were showing\r\noff.  The keys sank and rose mysteriously.  Then all became still.  For a\r\nmoment Ossipon imagined the overlighted place changed into a dreadful\r\nblack hole belching horrible fumes choked with ghastly rubbish of smashed\r\nbrickwork and mutilated corpses.  He had such a distinct perception of\r\nruin and death that he shuddered again.  The other observed, with an air\r\nof calm sufficiency:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the last instance it is character alone that makes for one\xe2\x80\x99s safety.\r\nThere are very few people in the world whose character is as well\r\nestablished as mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder how you managed it,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Ossipon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForce of personality,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, without raising his voice; and\r\ncoming from the mouth of that obviously miserable organism the assertion\r\ncaused the robust Ossipon to bite his lower lip.  \xe2\x80\x9cForce of personality,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe repeated, with ostentatious calm.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have the means to make myself\r\ndeadly, but that by itself, you understand, is absolutely nothing in the\r\nway of protection.  What is effective is the belief those people have in\r\nmy will to use the means.  That\xe2\x80\x99s their impression.  It is absolute.\r\nTherefore I am deadly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are individuals of character amongst that lot too,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered\r\nOssipon ominously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly.  But it is a matter of degree obviously, since, for instance,\r\nI am not impressed by them.  Therefore they are inferior.  They cannot be\r\notherwise.  Their character is built upon conventional morality.  It\r\nleans on the social order.  Mine stands free from everything artificial.\r\nThey are bound in all sorts of conventions.  They depend on life, which,\r\nin this connection, is a historical fact surrounded by all sorts of\r\nrestraints and considerations, a complex organised fact open to attack at\r\nevery point; whereas I depend on death, which knows no restraint and\r\ncannot be attacked.  My superiority is evident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a transcendental way of putting it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon, watching the\r\ncold glitter of the round spectacles.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Karl Yundt say much\r\nthe same thing not very long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKarl Yundt,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled the other contemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9cthe delegate of the\r\nInternational Red Committee, has been a posturing shadow all his life.\r\nThere are three of you delegates, aren\xe2\x80\x99t there?  I won\xe2\x80\x99t define the other\r\ntwo, as you are one of them.  But what you say means nothing.  You are\r\nthe worthy delegates for revolutionary propaganda, but the trouble is not\r\nonly that you are as unable to think independently as any respectable\r\ngrocer or journalist of them all, but that you have no character\r\nwhatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon could not restrain a start of indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you want from us?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in a deadened voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis it you are after yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA perfect detonator,\xe2\x80\x9d was the peremptory answer.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you making\r\nthat face for?  You see, you can\xe2\x80\x99t even bear the mention of something\r\nconclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not making a face,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the annoyed Ossipon bearishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou revolutionists,\xe2\x80\x9d the other continued, with leisurely\r\nself-confidence, \xe2\x80\x9care the slaves of the social convention, which is\r\nafraid of you; slaves of it as much as the very police that stands up in\r\nthe defence of that convention.  Clearly you are, since you want to\r\nrevolutionise it.  It governs your thought, of course, and your action\r\ntoo, and thus neither your thought nor your action can ever be\r\nconclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  He paused, tranquil, with that air of close, endless\r\nsilence, then almost immediately went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not a bit better than\r\nthe forces arrayed against you\xe2\x80\x94than the police, for instance.  The other\r\nday I came suddenly upon Chief Inspector Heat at the corner of Tottenham\r\nCourt Road.  He looked at me very steadily.  But I did not look at him.\r\nWhy should I give him more than a glance?  He was thinking of many\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94of his superiors, of his reputation, of the law courts, of his\r\nsalary, of newspapers\xe2\x80\x94of a hundred things.  But I was thinking of my\r\nperfect detonator only.  He meant nothing to me.  He was as insignificant\r\nas\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t call to mind anything insignificant enough to compare him\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94except Karl Yundt perhaps.  Like to like.  The terrorist and the\r\npoliceman both come from the same basket.  Revolution, legality\xe2\x80\x94counter\r\nmoves in the same game; forms of idleness at bottom identical.  He plays\r\nhis little game\xe2\x80\x94so do you propagandists.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t play; I work\r\nfourteen hours a day, and go hungry sometimes.  My experiments cost money\r\nnow and again, and then I must do without food for a day or two.  You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlooking at my beer.  Yes.  I have had two glasses already, and shall have\r\nanother presently.  This is a little holiday, and I celebrate it alone.\r\nWhy not?  I\xe2\x80\x99ve the grit to work alone, quite alone, absolutely alone.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve worked alone for years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon\xe2\x80\x99s face had turned dusky red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the perfect detonator\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he sneered, very low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the other.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a good definition.  You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find\r\nanything half so precise to define the nature of your activity with all\r\nyour committees and delegations.  It is I who am the true propagandist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t discuss that point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon, with an air of rising above\r\npersonal considerations.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to spoil your holiday\r\nfor you, though.  There\xe2\x80\x99s a man blown up in Greenwich Park this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have been yelling the news in the streets since two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.  I\r\nbought the paper, and just ran in here.  Then I saw you sitting at this\r\ntable.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it in my pocket now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pulled the newspaper out.  It was a good-sized rosy sheet, as if\r\nflushed by the warmth of its own convictions, which were optimistic.  He\r\nscanned the pages rapidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  Here it is.  Bomb in Greenwich Park.  There isn\xe2\x80\x99t much so far.\r\nHalf-past eleven.  Foggy morning.  Effects of explosion felt as far as\r\nRomney Road and Park Place.  Enormous hole in the ground under a tree\r\nfilled with smashed roots and broken branches.  All round fragments of a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s body blown to pieces.  That\xe2\x80\x99s all.  The rest\xe2\x80\x99s mere newspaper gup.\r\nNo doubt a wicked attempt to blow up the Observatory, they say.  H\xe2\x80\x99m.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s hardly credible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the paper for a while longer in silence, then passed it to\r\nthe other, who after gazing abstractedly at the print laid it down\r\nwithout comment.\r\n\r\nIt was Ossipon who spoke first\xe2\x80\x94still resentful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fragments of only _one_ man, you note.  Ergo: blew _himself_ up.\r\nThat spoils your day off for you\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t it?  Were you expecting that sort\r\nof move?  I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the slightest idea\xe2\x80\x94not the ghost of a notion of\r\nanything of the sort being planned to come off here\xe2\x80\x94in this country.\r\nUnder the present circumstances it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing short of criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little man lifted his thin black eyebrows with dispassionate scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCriminal!  What is that?  What _is_ crime?  What can be the meaning of\r\nsuch an assertion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to express myself?  One must use the current words,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nOssipon impatiently.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe meaning of this assertion is that this\r\nbusiness may affect our position very adversely in this country.  Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat crime enough for you?  I am convinced you have been giving away some\r\nof your stuff lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon stared hard.  The other, without flinching, lowered and raised\r\nhis head slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out the editor of the F. P. leaflets in an intense\r\nwhisper.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo!  And are you really handing it over at large like this,\r\nfor the asking, to the first fool that comes along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so!  The condemned social order has not been built up on paper and\r\nink, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy that a combination of paper and ink will ever put\r\nan end to it, whatever you may think.  Yes, I would give the stuff with\r\nboth hands to every man, woman, or fool that likes to come along.  I know\r\nwhat you are thinking about.  But I am not taking my cue from the Red\r\nCommittee.  I would see you all hounded out of here, or arrested\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nbeheaded for that matter\xe2\x80\x94without turning a hair.  What happens to us as\r\nindividuals is not of the least consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke carelessly, without heat, almost without feeling, and Ossipon,\r\nsecretly much affected, tried to copy this detachment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the police here knew their business they would shoot you full of\r\nholes with revolvers, or else try to sand-bag you from behind in broad\r\ndaylight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little man seemed already to have considered that point of view in\r\nhis dispassionate self-confident manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he assented with the utmost readiness.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut for that they would\r\nhave to face their own institutions.  Do you see?  That requires uncommon\r\ngrit.  Grit of a special kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon blinked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what would happen to you if you were to set up\r\nyour laboratory in the States.  They don\xe2\x80\x99t stand on ceremony with their\r\ninstitutions there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not likely to go and see.  Otherwise your remark is just,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted\r\nthe other.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey have more character over there, and their character is\r\nessentially anarchistic.  Fertile ground for us, the States\xe2\x80\x94very good\r\nground.  The great Republic has the root of the destructive matter in\r\nher.  The collective temperament is lawless.  Excellent.  They may shoot\r\nus down, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too transcendental for me,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Ossipon, with moody concern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLogical,\xe2\x80\x9d protested the other.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere are several kinds of logic.  This\r\nis the enlightened kind.  America is all right.  It is this country that\r\nis dangerous, with her idealistic conception of legality.  The social\r\nspirit of this people is wrapped up in scrupulous prejudices, and that is\r\nfatal to our work.  You talk of England being our only refuge!  So much\r\nthe worse.  Capua!  What do we want with refuges?  Here you talk, print,\r\nplot, and do nothing.  I daresay it\xe2\x80\x99s very convenient for such Karl\r\nYundts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders slightly, then added with the same leisurely\r\nassurance: \xe2\x80\x9cTo break up the superstition and worship of legality should\r\nbe our aim.  Nothing would please me more than to see Inspector Heat and\r\nhis likes take to shooting us down in broad daylight with the approval of\r\nthe public.  Half our battle would be won then; the disintegration of the\r\nold morality would have set in in its very temple.  That is what you\r\nought to aim at.  But you revolutionists will never understand that.  You\r\nplan the future, you lose yourselves in reveries of economical systems\r\nderived from what is; whereas what\xe2\x80\x99s wanted is a clean sweep and a clear\r\nstart for a new conception of life.  That sort of future will take care\r\nof itself if you will only make room for it.  Therefore I would shovel my\r\nstuff in heaps at the corners of the streets if I had enough for that;\r\nand as I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, I do my best by perfecting a really dependable\r\ndetonator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon, who had been mentally swimming in deep waters, seized upon the\r\nlast word as if it were a saving plank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  Your detonators.  I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t one of your\r\ndetonators that made a clean sweep of the man in the park.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shade of vexation darkened the determined sallow face confronting\r\nOssipon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy difficulty consists precisely in experimenting practically with the\r\nvarious kinds.  They must be tried after all.  Besides\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho could that fellow be?  I assure you that we in London had no\r\nknowledge\xe2\x80\x94Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you describe the person you gave the stuff to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other turned his spectacles upon Ossipon like a pair of searchlights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDescribe him,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated slowly.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there can be the\r\nslightest objection now.  I will describe him to you in one word\xe2\x80\x94Verloc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon, whom curiosity had lifted a few inches off his seat, dropped\r\nback, as if hit in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerloc!  Impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe self-possessed little man nodded slightly once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  He\xe2\x80\x99s the person.  You can\xe2\x80\x99t say that in this case I was giving my\r\nstuff to the first fool that came along.  He was a prominent member of\r\nthe group as far as I understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon.  \xe2\x80\x9cProminent.  No, not exactly.  He was the centre\r\nfor general intelligence, and usually received comrades coming over here.\r\nMore useful than important.  Man of no ideas.  Years ago he used to speak\r\nat meetings\xe2\x80\x94in France, I believe.  Not very well, though.  He was trusted\r\nby such men as Latorre, Moser and all that old lot.  The only talent he\r\nshowed really was his ability to elude the attentions of the police\r\nsomehow.  Here, for instance, he did not seem to be looked after very\r\nclosely.  He was regularly married, you know.  I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s with her\r\nmoney that he started that shop.  Seemed to make it pay, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon paused abruptly, muttered to himself \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what that woman\r\nwill do now?\xe2\x80\x9d and fell into thought.\r\n\r\nThe other waited with ostentatious indifference.  His parentage was\r\nobscure, and he was generally known only by his nickname of Professor.\r\nHis title to that designation consisted in his having been once assistant\r\ndemonstrator in chemistry at some technical institute.  He quarrelled\r\nwith the authorities upon a question of unfair treatment.  Afterwards he\r\nobtained a post in the laboratory of a manufactory of dyes.  There too he\r\nhad been treated with revolting injustice.  His struggles, his\r\nprivations, his hard work to raise himself in the social scale, had\r\nfilled him with such an exalted conviction of his merits that it was\r\nextremely difficult for the world to treat him with justice\xe2\x80\x94the standard\r\nof that notion depending so much upon the patience of the individual.\r\nThe Professor had genius, but lacked the great social virtue of\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIntellectually a nonentity,\xe2\x80\x9d Ossipon pronounced aloud, abandoning\r\nsuddenly the inward contemplation of Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s bereaved person and\r\nbusiness.  \xe2\x80\x9cQuite an ordinary personality.  You are wrong in not keeping\r\nmore in touch with the comrades, Professor,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a reproving\r\ntone.  \xe2\x80\x9cDid he say anything to you\xe2\x80\x94give you some idea of his intentions?\r\nI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen him for a month.  It seems impossible that he should be\r\ngone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me it was going to be a demonstration against a building,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Professor.  \xe2\x80\x9cI had to know that much to prepare the missile.  I\r\npointed out to him that I had hardly a sufficient quantity for a\r\ncompletely destructive result, but he pressed me very earnestly to do my\r\nbest.  As he wanted something that could be carried openly in the hand, I\r\nproposed to make use of an old one-gallon copal varnish can I happened to\r\nhave by me.  He was pleased at the idea.  It gave me some trouble,\r\nbecause I had to cut out the bottom first and solder it on again\r\nafterwards.  When prepared for use, the can enclosed a wide-mouthed,\r\nwell-corked jar of thick glass packed around with some wet clay and\r\ncontaining sixteen ounces of X2 green powder.  The detonator was\r\nconnected with the screw top of the can.  It was ingenious\xe2\x80\x94a combination\r\nof time and shock.  I explained the system to him.  It was a thin tube of\r\ntin enclosing a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon\xe2\x80\x99s attention had wandered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t tell.  Screwed the top on tight, which would make the connection,\r\nand then forgot the time.  It was set for twenty minutes.  On the other\r\nhand, the time contact being made, a sharp shock would bring about the\r\nexplosion at once.  He either ran the time too close, or simply let the\r\nthing fall.  The contact was made all right\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s clear to me at any\r\nrate.  The system\xe2\x80\x99s worked perfectly.  And yet you would think that a\r\ncommon fool in a hurry would be much more likely to forget to make the\r\ncontact altogether.  I was worrying myself about that sort of failure\r\nmostly.  But there are more kinds of fools than one can guard against.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t expect a detonator to be absolutely fool-proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe beckoned to a waiter.  Ossipon sat rigid, with the abstracted gaze of\r\nmental travail.  After the man had gone away with the money he roused\r\nhimself, with an air of profound dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s extremely unpleasant for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused.  \xe2\x80\x9cKarl has been in bed with\r\nbronchitis for a week.  There\xe2\x80\x99s an even chance that he will never get up\r\nagain.  Michaelis\xe2\x80\x99s luxuriating in the country somewhere.  A fashionable\r\npublisher has offered him five hundred pounds for a book.  It will be a\r\nghastly failure.  He has lost the habit of consecutive thinking in\r\nprison, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor on his feet, now buttoning his coat, looked about him with\r\nperfect indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ossipon wearily.  He dreaded the blame\r\nof the Central Red Committee, a body which had no permanent place of\r\nabode, and of whose membership he was not exactly informed.  If this\r\naffair eventuated in the stoppage of the modest subsidy allotted to the\r\npublication of the F. P. pamphlets, then indeed he would have to regret\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s inexplicable folly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSolidarity with the extremest form of action is one thing, and silly\r\nrecklessness is another,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sort of moody brutality.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what came to Verloc.  There\xe2\x80\x99s some mystery there.  However,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s gone.  You may take it as you like, but under the circumstances the\r\nonly policy for the militant revolutionary group is to disclaim all\r\nconnection with this damned freak of yours.  How to make the disclaimer\r\nconvincing enough is what bothers me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little man on his feet, buttoned up and ready to go, was no taller\r\nthan the seated Ossipon.  He levelled his spectacles at the latter\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\npoint-blank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might ask the police for a testimonial of good conduct.  They know\r\nwhere every one of you slept last night.  Perhaps if you asked them they\r\nwould consent to publish some sort of official statement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt they are aware well enough that we had nothing to do with\r\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Ossipon bitterly.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat they will say is another thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe remained thoughtful, disregarding the short, owlish, shabby figure\r\nstanding by his side.  \xe2\x80\x9cI must lay hands on Michaelis at once, and get\r\nhim to speak from his heart at one of our gatherings.  The public has a\r\nsort of sentimental regard for that fellow.  His name is known.  And I am\r\nin touch with a few reporters on the big dailies.  What he would say\r\nwould be utter bosh, but he has a turn of talk that makes it go down all\r\nthe same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike treacle,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected the Professor, rather low, keeping an\r\nimpassive expression.\r\n\r\nThe perplexed Ossipon went on communing with himself half audibly, after\r\nthe manner of a man reflecting in perfect solitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfounded ass!  To leave such an imbecile business on my hands.  And I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t even know if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat with compressed lips.  The idea of going for news straight to the\r\nshop lacked charm.  His notion was that Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s shop might have been\r\nturned already into a police trap.  They will be bound to make some\r\narrests, he thought, with something resembling virtuous indignation, for\r\nthe even tenor of his revolutionary life was menaced by no fault of his.\r\nAnd yet unless he went there he ran the risk of remaining in ignorance of\r\nwhat perhaps it would be very material for him to know.  Then he\r\nreflected that, if the man in the park had been so very much blown to\r\npieces as the evening papers said, he could not have been identified.\r\nAnd if so, the police could have no special reason for watching Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop more closely than any other place known to be frequented by marked\r\nanarchists\xe2\x80\x94no more reason, in fact, than for watching the doors of the\r\nSilenus.  There would be a lot of watching all round, no matter where he\r\nwent.  Still\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what I had better do now?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, taking counsel with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nA rasping voice at his elbow said, with sedate scorn:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFasten yourself upon the woman for all she\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter uttering these words the Professor walked away from the table.\r\nOssipon, whom that piece of insight had taken unawares, gave one\r\nineffectual start, and remained still, with a helpless gaze, as though\r\nnailed fast to the seat of his chair.  The lonely piano, without as much\r\nas a music stool to help it, struck a few chords courageously, and\r\nbeginning a selection of national airs, played him out at last to the\r\ntune of \xe2\x80\x9cBlue Bells of Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d  The painfully detached notes grew\r\nfaint behind his back while he went slowly upstairs, across the hall, and\r\ninto the street.\r\n\r\nIn front of the great doorway a dismal row of newspaper sellers standing\r\nclear of the pavement dealt out their wares from the gutter.  It was a\r\nraw, gloomy day of the early spring; and the grimy sky, the mud of the\r\nstreets, the rags of the dirty men, harmonised excellently with the\r\neruption of the damp, rubbishy sheets of paper soiled with printers\xe2\x80\x99 ink.\r\nThe posters, maculated with filth, garnished like tapestry the sweep of\r\nthe curbstone.  The trade in afternoon papers was brisk, yet, in\r\ncomparison with the swift, constant march of foot traffic, the effect was\r\nof indifference, of a disregarded distribution.  Ossipon looked hurriedly\r\nboth ways before stepping out into the cross-currents, but the Professor\r\nwas already out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Professor had turned into a street to the left, and walked along,\r\nwith his head carried rigidly erect, in a crowd whose every individual\r\nalmost overtopped his stunted stature.  It was vain to pretend to himself\r\nthat he was not disappointed.  But that was mere feeling; the stoicism of\r\nhis thought could not be disturbed by this or any other failure.  Next\r\ntime, or the time after next, a telling stroke would be\r\ndelivered\xe2\x80\x94something really startling\xe2\x80\x94a blow fit to open the first crack\r\nin the imposing front of the great edifice of legal conceptions\r\nsheltering the atrocious injustice of society.  Of humble origin, and\r\nwith an appearance really so mean as to stand in the way of his\r\nconsiderable natural abilities, his imagination had been fired early by\r\nthe tales of men rising from the depths of poverty to positions of\r\nauthority and affluence.  The extreme, almost ascetic purity of his\r\nthought, combined with an astounding ignorance of worldly conditions, had\r\nset before him a goal of power and prestige to be attained without the\r\nmedium of arts, graces, tact, wealth\xe2\x80\x94by sheer weight of merit alone.  On\r\nthat view he considered himself entitled to undisputed success.  His\r\nfather, a delicate dark enthusiast with a sloping forehead, had been an\r\nitinerant and rousing preacher of some obscure but rigid Christian sect\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nman supremely confident in the privileges of his righteousness.  In the\r\nson, individualist by temperament, once the science of colleges had\r\nreplaced thoroughly the faith of conventicles, this moral attitude\r\ntranslated itself into a frenzied puritanism of ambition.  He nursed it\r\nas something secularly holy.  To see it thwarted opened his eyes to the\r\ntrue nature of the world, whose morality was artificial, corrupt, and\r\nblasphemous.  The way of even the most justifiable revolutions is\r\nprepared by personal impulses disguised into creeds.  The Professor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindignation found in itself a final cause that absolved him from the sin\r\nof turning to destruction as the agent of his ambition.  To destroy\r\npublic faith in legality was the imperfect formula of his pedantic\r\nfanaticism; but the subconscious conviction that the framework of an\r\nestablished social order cannot be effectually shattered except by some\r\nform of collective or individual violence was precise and correct.  He\r\nwas a moral agent\xe2\x80\x94that was settled in his mind.  By exercising his agency\r\nwith ruthless defiance he procured for himself the appearances of power\r\nand personal prestige.  That was undeniable to his vengeful bitterness.\r\nIt pacified its unrest; and in their own way the most ardent of\r\nrevolutionaries are perhaps doing no more but seeking for peace in common\r\nwith the rest of mankind\xe2\x80\x94the peace of soothed vanity, of satisfied\r\nappetites, or perhaps of appeased conscience.\r\n\r\nLost in the crowd, miserable and undersized, he meditated confidently on\r\nhis power, keeping his hand in the left pocket of his trousers, grasping\r\nlightly the india-rubber ball, the supreme guarantee of his sinister\r\nfreedom; but after a while he became disagreeably affected by the sight\r\nof the roadway thronged with vehicles and of the pavement crowded with\r\nmen and women.  He was in a long, straight street, peopled by a mere\r\nfraction of an immense multitude; but all round him, on and on, even to\r\nthe limits of the horizon hidden by the enormous piles of bricks, he felt\r\nthe mass of mankind mighty in its numbers.  They swarmed numerous like\r\nlocusts, industrious like ants, thoughtless like a natural force, pushing\r\non blind and orderly and absorbed, impervious to sentiment, to logic, to\r\nterror too perhaps.\r\n\r\nThat was the form of doubt he feared most.  Impervious to fear!  Often\r\nwhile walking abroad, when he happened also to come out of himself, he\r\nhad such moments of dreadful and sane mistrust of mankind.  What if\r\nnothing could move them?  Such moments come to all men whose ambition\r\naims at a direct grasp upon humanity\xe2\x80\x94to artists, politicians, thinkers,\r\nreformers, or saints.  A despicable emotional state this, against which\r\nsolitude fortifies a superior character; and with severe exultation the\r\nProfessor thought of the refuge of his room, with its padlocked cupboard,\r\nlost in a wilderness of poor houses, the hermitage of the perfect\r\nanarchist.  In order to reach sooner the point where he could take his\r\nomnibus, he turned brusquely out of the populous street into a narrow and\r\ndusky alley paved with flagstones.  On one side the low brick houses had\r\nin their dusty windows the sightless, moribund look of incurable\r\ndecay\xe2\x80\x94empty shells awaiting demolition.  From the other side life had not\r\ndeparted wholly as yet.  Facing the only gas-lamp yawned the cavern of a\r\nsecond-hand furniture dealer, where, deep in the gloom of a sort of\r\nnarrow avenue winding through a bizarre forest of wardrobes, with an\r\nundergrowth tangle of table legs, a tall pier-glass glimmered like a pool\r\nof water in a wood.  An unhappy, homeless couch, accompanied by two\r\nunrelated chairs, stood in the open.  The only human being making use of\r\nthe alley besides the Professor, coming stalwart and erect from the\r\nopposite direction, checked his swinging pace suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and stood a little on one side watchfully.\r\n\r\nThe Professor had already stopped, with a ready half turn which brought\r\nhis shoulders very near the other wall.  His right hand fell lightly on\r\nthe back of the outcast couch, the left remained purposefully plunged\r\ndeep in the trousers pocket, and the roundness of the heavy rimmed\r\nspectacles imparted an owlish character to his moody, unperturbed face.\r\n\r\nIt was like a meeting in a side corridor of a mansion full of life.  The\r\nstalwart man was buttoned up in a dark overcoat, and carried an umbrella.\r\nHis hat, tilted back, uncovered a good deal of forehead, which appeared\r\nvery white in the dusk.  In the dark patches of the orbits the eyeballs\r\nglimmered piercingly.  Long, drooping moustaches, the colour of ripe\r\ncorn, framed with their points the square block of his shaved chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not looking for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said curtly.\r\n\r\nThe Professor did not stir an inch.  The blended noises of the enormous\r\ntown sank down to an inarticulate low murmur.  Chief Inspector Heat of\r\nthe Special Crimes Department changed his tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in a hurry to get home?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with mocking simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe unwholesome-looking little moral agent of destruction exulted\r\nsilently in the possession of personal prestige, keeping in check this\r\nman armed with the defensive mandate of a menaced society.  More\r\nfortunate than Caligula, who wished that the Roman Senate had only one\r\nhead for the better satisfaction of his cruel lust, he beheld in that one\r\nman all the forces he had set at defiance: the force of law, property,\r\noppression, and injustice.  He beheld all his enemies, and fearlessly\r\nconfronted them all in a supreme satisfaction of his vanity.  They stood\r\nperplexed before him as if before a dreadful portent.  He gloated\r\ninwardly over the chance of this meeting affirming his superiority over\r\nall the multitude of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt was in reality a chance meeting.  Chief Inspector Heat had had a\r\ndisagreeably busy day since his department received the first telegram\r\nfrom Greenwich a little before eleven in the morning.  First of all, the\r\nfact of the outrage being attempted less than a week after he had assured\r\na high official that no outbreak of anarchist activity was to be\r\napprehended was sufficiently annoying.  If he ever thought himself safe\r\nin making a statement, it was then.  He had made that statement with\r\ninfinite satisfaction to himself, because it was clear that the high\r\nofficial desired greatly to hear that very thing.  He had affirmed that\r\nnothing of the sort could even be thought of without the department being\r\naware of it within twenty-four hours; and he had spoken thus in his\r\nconsciousness of being the great expert of his department.  He had gone\r\neven so far as to utter words which true wisdom would have kept back.\r\nBut Chief Inspector Heat was not very wise\xe2\x80\x94at least not truly so.  True\r\nwisdom, which is not certain of anything in this world of contradictions,\r\nwould have prevented him from attaining his present position.  It would\r\nhave alarmed his superiors, and done away with his chances of promotion.\r\nHis promotion had been very rapid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of them, sir, that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lay our hands on at any\r\ntime of night and day.  We know what each of them is doing hour by hour,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe had declared.  And the high official had deigned to smile.  This was\r\nso obviously the right thing to say for an officer of Chief Inspector\r\nHeat\xe2\x80\x99s reputation that it was perfectly delightful.  The high official\r\nbelieved the declaration, which chimed in with his idea of the fitness of\r\nthings.  His wisdom was of an official kind, or else he might have\r\nreflected upon a matter not of theory but of experience that in the\r\nclose-woven stuff of relations between conspirator and police there occur\r\nunexpected solutions of continuity, sudden holes in space and time.  A\r\ngiven anarchist may be watched inch by inch and minute by minute, but a\r\nmoment always comes when somehow all sight and touch of him are lost for\r\na few hours, during which something (generally an explosion) more or less\r\ndeplorable does happen.  But the high official, carried away by his sense\r\nof the fitness of things, had smiled, and now the recollection of that\r\nsmile was very annoying to Chief Inspector Heat, principal expert in\r\nanarchist procedure.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only circumstance whose recollection depressed the usual\r\nserenity of the eminent specialist.  There was another dating back only\r\nto that very morning.  The thought that when called urgently to his\r\nAssistant Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s private room he had been unable to conceal his\r\nastonishment was distinctly vexing.  His instinct of a successful man had\r\ntaught him long ago that, as a general rule, a reputation is built on\r\nmanner as much as on achievement.  And he felt that his manner when\r\nconfronted with the telegram had not been impressive.  He had opened his\r\neyes widely, and had exclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d exposing himself thereby to\r\nthe unanswerable retort of a finger-tip laid forcibly on the telegram\r\nwhich the Assistant Commissioner, after reading it aloud, had flung on\r\nthe desk.  To be crushed, as it were, under the tip of a forefinger was\r\nan unpleasant experience.  Very damaging, too!  Furthermore, Chief\r\nInspector Heat was conscious of not having mended matters by allowing\r\nhimself to express a conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I can tell you at once: none of our lot had anything to do\r\nwith this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was strong in his integrity of a good detective, but he saw now that\r\nan impenetrably attentive reserve towards this incident would have served\r\nhis reputation better.  On the other hand, he admitted to himself that it\r\nwas difficult to preserve one\xe2\x80\x99s reputation if rank outsiders were going\r\nto take a hand in the business.  Outsiders are the bane of the police as\r\nof other professions.  The tone of the Assistant Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s remarks\r\nhad been sour enough to set one\xe2\x80\x99s teeth on edge.\r\n\r\nAnd since breakfast Chief Inspector Heat had not managed to get anything\r\nto eat.\r\n\r\nStarting immediately to begin his investigation on the spot, he had\r\nswallowed a good deal of raw, unwholesome fog in the park.  Then he had\r\nwalked over to the hospital; and when the investigation in Greenwich was\r\nconcluded at last he had lost his inclination for food.  Not accustomed,\r\nas the doctors are, to examine closely the mangled remains of human\r\nbeings, he had been shocked by the sight disclosed to his view when a\r\nwaterproof sheet had been lifted off a table in a certain apartment of\r\nthe hospital.\r\n\r\nAnother waterproof sheet was spread over that table in the manner of a\r\ntable-cloth, with the corners turned up over a sort of mound\xe2\x80\x94a heap of\r\nrags, scorched and bloodstained, half concealing what might have been an\r\naccumulation of raw material for a cannibal feast.  It required\r\nconsiderable firmness of mind not to recoil before that sight.  Chief\r\nInspector Heat, an efficient officer of his department, stood his ground,\r\nbut for a whole minute he did not advance.  A local constable in uniform\r\ncast a sidelong glance, and said, with stolid simplicity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s all there.  Every bit of him.  It was a job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been the first man on the spot after the explosion.  He mentioned\r\nthe fact again.  He had seen something like a heavy flash of lightning in\r\nthe fog.  At that time he was standing at the door of the King William\r\nStreet Lodge talking to the keeper.  The concussion made him tingle all\r\nover.  He ran between the trees towards the Observatory.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs fast as my\r\nlegs would carry me,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated twice.\r\n\r\nChief Inspector Heat, bending forward over the table in a gingerly and\r\nhorrified manner, let him run on.  The hospital porter and another man\r\nturned down the corners of the cloth, and stepped aside.  The Chief\r\nInspector\xe2\x80\x99s eyes searched the gruesome detail of that heap of mixed\r\nthings, which seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used a shovel,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, observing a sprinkling of small gravel,\r\ntiny brown bits of bark, and particles of splintered wood as fine as\r\nneedles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad to in one place,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stolid constable.  \xe2\x80\x9cI sent a keeper to\r\nfetch a spade.  When he heard me scraping the ground with it he leaned\r\nhis forehead against a tree, and was as sick as a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector, stooping guardedly over the table, fought down the\r\nunpleasant sensation in his throat.  The shattering violence of\r\ndestruction which had made of that body a heap of nameless fragments\r\naffected his feelings with a sense of ruthless cruelty, though his reason\r\ntold him the effect must have been as swift as a flash of lightning.  The\r\nman, whoever he was, had died instantaneously; and yet it seemed\r\nimpossible to believe that a human body could have reached that state of\r\ndisintegration without passing through the pangs of inconceivable agony.\r\nNo physiologist, and still less of a metaphysician, Chief Inspector Heat\r\nrose by the force of sympathy, which is a form of fear, above the vulgar\r\nconception of time.  Instantaneous!  He remembered all he had ever read\r\nin popular publications of long and terrifying dreams dreamed in the\r\ninstant of waking; of the whole past life lived with frightful intensity\r\nby a drowning man as his doomed head bobs up, streaming, for the last\r\ntime.  The inexplicable mysteries of conscious existence beset Chief\r\nInspector Heat till he evolved a horrible notion that ages of atrocious\r\npain and mental torture could be contained between two successive winks\r\nof an eye.  And meantime the Chief Inspector went on, peering at the\r\ntable with a calm face and the slightly anxious attention of an indigent\r\ncustomer bending over what may be called the by-products of a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop with a view to an inexpensive Sunday dinner.  All the time his\r\ntrained faculties of an excellent investigator, who scorns no chance of\r\ninformation, followed the self-satisfied, disjointed loquacity of the\r\nconstable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fair-haired fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d the last observed in a placid tone, and paused.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old woman who spoke to the sergeant noticed a fair-haired fellow\r\ncoming out of Maze Hill Station.\xe2\x80\x9d  He paused.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he was a fair-haired\r\nfellow.  She noticed two men coming out of the station after the uptrain\r\nhad gone on,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued slowly.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell if they were\r\ntogether.  She took no particular notice of the big one, but the other\r\nwas a fair, slight chap, carrying a tin varnish can in one hand.\xe2\x80\x9d  The\r\nconstable ceased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the Chief Inspector, with his eyes fixed on\r\nthe table, and a vague notion in his mind of an inquest to be held\r\npresently upon a person likely to remain for ever unknown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  She\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper to a retired publican, and attends the chapel in\r\nPark Place sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d the constable uttered weightily, and paused, with\r\nanother oblique glance at the table.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, here he is\xe2\x80\x94all of him I could see.  Fair.\r\nSlight\xe2\x80\x94slight enough.  Look at that foot there.  I picked up the legs\r\nfirst, one after another.  He was that scattered you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where to\r\nbegin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe constable paused; the least flicker of an innocent self-laudatory\r\nsmile invested his round face with an infantile expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStumbled,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced positively.  \xe2\x80\x9cI stumbled once myself, and\r\npitched on my head too, while running up.  Them roots do stick out all\r\nabout the place.  Stumbled against the root of a tree and fell, and that\r\nthing he was carrying must have gone off right under his chest, I\r\nexpect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe echo of the words \xe2\x80\x9cPerson unknown\xe2\x80\x9d repeating itself in his inner\r\nconsciousness bothered the Chief Inspector considerably.  He would have\r\nliked to trace this affair back to its mysterious origin for his own\r\ninformation.  He was professionally curious.  Before the public he would\r\nhave liked to vindicate the efficiency of his department by establishing\r\nthe identity of that man.  He was a loyal servant.  That, however,\r\nappeared impossible.  The first term of the problem was unreadable\xe2\x80\x94lacked\r\nall suggestion but that of atrocious cruelty.\r\n\r\nOvercoming his physical repugnance, Chief Inspector Heat stretched out\r\nhis hand without conviction for the salving of his conscience, and took\r\nup the least soiled of the rags.  It was a narrow strip of velvet with a\r\nlarger triangular piece of dark blue cloth hanging from it.  He held it\r\nup to his eyes; and the police constable spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVelvet collar.  Funny the old woman should have noticed the velvet\r\ncollar.  Dark blue overcoat with a velvet collar, she has told us.  He\r\nwas the chap she saw, and no mistake.  And here he is all complete,\r\nvelvet collar and all.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I missed a single piece as big as a\r\npostage stamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point the trained faculties of the Chief Inspector ceased to hear\r\nthe voice of the constable.  He moved to one of the windows for better\r\nlight.  His face, averted from the room, expressed a startled intense\r\ninterest while he examined closely the triangular piece of broad-cloth.\r\nBy a sudden jerk he detached it, and _only_ after stuffing it into his\r\npocket turned round to the room, and flung the velvet collar back on the\r\ntable\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCover up,\xe2\x80\x9d he directed the attendants curtly, without another look, and,\r\nsaluted by the constable, carried off his spoil hastily.\r\n\r\nA convenient train whirled him up to town, alone and pondering deeply, in\r\na third-class compartment.  That singed piece of cloth was incredibly\r\nvaluable, and he could not defend himself from astonishment at the casual\r\nmanner it had come into his possession.  It was as if Fate had thrust\r\nthat clue into his hands.  And after the manner of the average man, whose\r\nambition is to command events, he began to mistrust such a gratuitous and\r\naccidental success\xe2\x80\x94just because it seemed forced upon him.  The practical\r\nvalue of success depends not a little on the way you look at it.  But\r\nFate looks at nothing.  It has no discretion.  He no longer considered it\r\neminently desirable all round to establish publicly the identity of the\r\nman who had blown himself up that morning with such horrible\r\ncompleteness.  But he was not certain of the view his department would\r\ntake.  A department is to those it employs a complex personality with\r\nideas and even fads of its own.  It depends on the loyal devotion of its\r\nservants, and the devoted loyalty of trusted servants is associated with\r\na certain amount of affectionate contempt, which keeps it sweet, as it\r\nwere.  By a benevolent provision of Nature no man is a hero to his valet,\r\nor else the heroes would have to brush their own clothes.  Likewise no\r\ndepartment appears perfectly wise to the intimacy of its workers.  A\r\ndepartment does not know so much as some of its servants.  Being a\r\ndispassionate organism, it can never be perfectly informed.  It would not\r\nbe good for its efficiency to know too much.  Chief Inspector Heat got\r\nout of the train in a state of thoughtfulness entirely untainted with\r\ndisloyalty, but not quite free of that jealous mistrust which so often\r\nsprings on the ground of perfect devotion, whether to women or to\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIt was in this mental disposition, physically very empty, but still\r\nnauseated by what he had seen, that he had come upon the Professor.\r\nUnder these conditions which make for irascibility in a sound, normal\r\nman, this meeting was specially unwelcome to Chief Inspector Heat.  He\r\nhad not been thinking of the Professor; he had not been thinking of any\r\nindividual anarchist at all.  The complexion of that case had somehow\r\nforced upon him the general idea of the absurdity of things human, which\r\nin the abstract is sufficiently annoying to an unphilosophical\r\ntemperament, and in concrete instances becomes exasperating beyond\r\nendurance.  At the beginning of his career Chief Inspector Heat had been\r\nconcerned with the more energetic forms of thieving.  He had gained his\r\nspurs in that sphere, and naturally enough had kept for it, after his\r\npromotion to another department, a feeling not very far removed from\r\naffection.  Thieving was not a sheer absurdity.  It was a form of human\r\nindustry, perverse indeed, but still an industry exercised in an\r\nindustrious world; it was work undertaken for the same reason as the work\r\nin potteries, in coal mines, in fields, in tool-grinding shops.  It was\r\nlabour, whose practical difference from the other forms of labour\r\nconsisted in the nature of its risk, which did not lie in ankylosis, or\r\nlead poisoning, or fire-damp, or gritty dust, but in what may be briefly\r\ndefined in its own special phraseology as \xe2\x80\x9cSeven years hard.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chief\r\nInspector Heat was, of course, not insensible to the gravity of moral\r\ndifferences.  But neither were the thieves he had been looking after.\r\nThey submitted to the severe sanctions of a morality familiar to Chief\r\nInspector Heat with a certain resignation.\r\n\r\nThey were his fellow-citizens gone wrong because of imperfect education,\r\nChief Inspector Heat believed; but allowing for that difference, he could\r\nunderstand the mind of a burglar, because, as a matter of fact, the mind\r\nand the instincts of a burglar are of the same kind as the mind and the\r\ninstincts of a police officer.  Both recognise the same conventions, and\r\nhave a working knowledge of each other\xe2\x80\x99s methods and of the routine of\r\ntheir respective trades.  They understand each other, which is\r\nadvantageous to both, and establishes a sort of amenity in their\r\nrelations.  Products of the same machine, one classed as useful and the\r\nother as noxious, they take the machine for granted in different ways,\r\nbut with a seriousness essentially the same.  The mind of Chief Inspector\r\nHeat was inaccessible to ideas of revolt.  But his thieves were not\r\nrebels.  His bodily vigour, his cool inflexible manner, his courage and\r\nhis fairness, had secured for him much respect and some adulation in the\r\nsphere of his early successes.  He had felt himself revered and admired.\r\nAnd Chief Inspector Heat, arrested within six paces of the anarchist\r\nnick-named the Professor, gave a thought of regret to the world of\r\nthieves\xe2\x80\x94sane, without morbid ideals, working by routine, respectful of\r\nconstituted authorities, free from all taint of hate and despair.\r\n\r\nAfter paying this tribute to what is normal in the constitution of\r\nsociety (for the idea of thieving appeared to his instinct as normal as\r\nthe idea of property), Chief Inspector Heat felt very angry with himself\r\nfor having stopped, for having spoken, for having taken that way at all\r\non the ground of it being a short cut from the station to the\r\nheadquarters.  And he spoke again in his big authoritative voice, which,\r\nbeing moderated, had a threatening character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not wanted, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nThe anarchist did not stir.  An inward laugh of derision uncovered not\r\nonly his teeth but his gums as well, shook him all over, without the\r\nslightest sound.  Chief Inspector Heat was led to add, against his better\r\njudgment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.  When I want you I will know where to find you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose were perfectly proper words, within the tradition and suitable to\r\nhis character of a police officer addressing one of his special flock.\r\nBut the reception they got departed from tradition and propriety.  It was\r\noutrageous.  The stunted, weakly figure before him spoke at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt the papers would give you an obituary notice then.  You\r\nknow best what that would be worth to you.  I should think you can\r\nimagine easily the sort of stuff that would be printed.  But you may be\r\nexposed to the unpleasantness of being buried together with me, though I\r\nsuppose your friends would make an effort to sort us out as much as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith all his healthy contempt for the spirit dictating such speeches, the\r\natrocious allusiveness of the words had its effect on Chief Inspector\r\nHeat.  He had too much insight, and too much exact information as well,\r\nto dismiss them as rot.  The dusk of this narrow lane took on a sinister\r\ntint from the dark, frail little figure, its back to the wall, and\r\nspeaking with a weak, self-confident voice.  To the vigorous, tenacious\r\nvitality of the Chief Inspector, the physical wretchedness of that being,\r\nso obviously not fit to live, was ominous; for it seemed to him that if\r\nhe had the misfortune to be such a miserable object he would not have\r\ncared how soon he died.  Life had such a strong hold upon him that a\r\nfresh wave of nausea broke out in slight perspiration upon his brow.  The\r\nmurmur of town life, the subdued rumble of wheels in the two invisible\r\nstreets to the right and left, came through the curve of the sordid lane\r\nto his ears with a precious familiarity and an appealing sweetness.  He\r\nwas human.  But Chief Inspector Heat was also a man, and he could not let\r\nsuch words pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this is good to frighten children with,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have you\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very well said, without scorn, with an almost austere quietness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s no time like the present,\r\nbelieve me.  For a man of real convictions this is a fine opportunity of\r\nself-sacrifice.  You may not find another so favourable, so humane.\r\nThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t even a cat near us, and these condemned old houses would make\r\na good heap of bricks where you stand.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll never get me at so little\r\ncost to life and property, which you are paid to protect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know who you\xe2\x80\x99re speaking to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chief Inspector Heat\r\nfirmly.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to lay my hands on you now I would be no better than\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  The game!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure our side will win in the end.  It may yet be necessary\r\nto make people believe that some of you ought to be shot at sight like\r\nmad dogs.  Then that will be the game.  But I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned if I know what\r\nyours is.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you know yourselves.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll never get\r\nanything by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeantime it\xe2\x80\x99s you who get something from it\xe2\x80\x94so far.  And you get it\r\neasily, too.  I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak of your salary, but haven\xe2\x80\x99t you made your\r\nname simply by not understanding what we are after?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you after, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chief Inspector Heat, with scornful\r\nhaste, like a man in a hurry who perceives he is wasting his time.\r\n\r\nThe perfect anarchist answered by a smile which did not part his thin\r\ncolourless lips; and the celebrated Chief Inspector felt a sense of\r\nsuperiority which induced him to raise a warning finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it up\xe2\x80\x94whatever it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an admonishing tone, but not so\r\nkindly as if he were condescending to give good advice to a cracksman of\r\nrepute.  \xe2\x80\x9cGive it up.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll find we are too many for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fixed smile on the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s lips wavered, as if the mocking spirit\r\nwithin had lost its assurance.  Chief Inspector Heat went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you believe me eh?  Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to look about you.  We\r\nare.  And anyway, you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing it well.  You\xe2\x80\x99re always making a mess\r\nof it.  Why, if the thieves didn\xe2\x80\x99t know their work better they would\r\nstarve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hint of an invincible multitude behind that man\xe2\x80\x99s back roused a\r\nsombre indignation in the breast of the Professor.  He smiled no longer\r\nhis enigmatic and mocking smile.  The resisting power of numbers, the\r\nunattackable stolidity of a great multitude, was the haunting fear of his\r\nsinister loneliness.  His lips trembled for some time before he managed\r\nto say in a strangled voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am doing my work better than you\xe2\x80\x99re doing yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do now,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Chief Inspector Heat hurriedly; and the\r\nProfessor laughed right out this time.  While still laughing he moved on;\r\nbut he did not laugh long.  It was a sad-faced, miserable little man who\r\nemerged from the narrow passage into the bustle of the broad\r\nthoroughfare.  He walked with the nerveless gait of a tramp going on,\r\nstill going on, indifferent to rain or sun in a sinister detachment from\r\nthe aspects of sky and earth.  Chief Inspector Heat, on the other hand,\r\nafter watching him for a while, stepped out with the purposeful briskness\r\nof a man disregarding indeed the inclemencies of the weather, but\r\nconscious of having an authorised mission on this earth and the moral\r\nsupport of his kind.  All the inhabitants of the immense town, the\r\npopulation of the whole country, and even the teeming millions struggling\r\nupon the planet, were with him\xe2\x80\x94down to the very thieves and mendicants.\r\nYes, the thieves themselves were sure to be with him in his present work.\r\nThe consciousness of universal support in his general activity heartened\r\nhim to grapple with the particular problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem immediately before the Chief Inspector was that of managing\r\nthe Assistant Commissioner of his department, his immediate superior.\r\nThis is the perennial problem of trusty and loyal servants; anarchism\r\ngave it its particular complexion, but nothing more.  Truth to say, Chief\r\nInspector Heat thought but little of anarchism.  He did not attach undue\r\nimportance to it, and could never bring himself to consider it seriously.\r\nIt had more the character of disorderly conduct; disorderly without the\r\nhuman excuse of drunkenness, which at any rate implies good feeling and\r\nan amiable leaning towards festivity.  As criminals, anarchists were\r\ndistinctly no class\xe2\x80\x94no class at all.  And recalling the Professor, Chief\r\nInspector Heat, without checking his swinging pace, muttered through his\r\nteeth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLunatic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCatching thieves was another matter altogether.  It had that quality of\r\nseriousness belonging to every form of open sport where the best man wins\r\nunder perfectly comprehensible rules.  There were no rules for dealing\r\nwith anarchists.  And that was distasteful to the Chief Inspector.  It\r\nwas all foolishness, but that foolishness excited the public mind,\r\naffected persons in high places, and touched upon international\r\nrelations.  A hard, merciless contempt settled rigidly on the Chief\r\nInspector\xe2\x80\x99s face as he walked on.  His mind ran over all the anarchists\r\nof his flock.  Not one of them had half the spunk of this or that burglar\r\nhe had known.  Not half\xe2\x80\x94not one-tenth.\r\n\r\nAt headquarters the Chief Inspector was admitted at once to the Assistant\r\nCommissioner\xe2\x80\x99s private room.  He found him, pen in hand, bent over a\r\ngreat table bestrewn with papers, as if worshipping an enormous double\r\ninkstand of bronze and crystal.  Speaking tubes resembling snakes were\r\ntied by the heads to the back of the Assistant Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s wooden\r\narm-chair, and their gaping mouths seemed ready to bite his elbows.  And\r\nin this attitude he raised only his eyes, whose lids were darker than his\r\nface and very much creased.  The reports had come in: every anarchist had\r\nbeen exactly accounted for.\r\n\r\nAfter saying this he lowered his eyes, signed rapidly two single sheets\r\nof paper, and only then laid down his pen, and sat well back, directing\r\nan inquiring gaze at his renowned subordinate.  The Chief Inspector stood\r\nit well, deferential but inscrutable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you were right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Assistant Commissioner, \xe2\x80\x9cin telling\r\nme at first that the London anarchists had nothing to do with this.  I\r\nquite appreciate the excellent watch kept on them by your men.  On the\r\nother hand, this, for the public, does not amount to more than a\r\nconfession of ignorance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s delivery was leisurely, as it were cautious.\r\nHis thought seemed to rest poised on a word before passing to another, as\r\nthough words had been the stepping-stones for his intellect picking its\r\nway across the waters of error.  \xe2\x80\x9cUnless you have brought something\r\nuseful from Greenwich,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector began at once the account of his investigation in a\r\nclear matter-of-fact manner.  His superior turning his chair a little,\r\nand crossing his thin legs, leaned sideways on his elbow, with one hand\r\nshading his eyes.  His listening attitude had a sort of angular and\r\nsorrowful grace.  Gleams as of highly burnished silver played on the\r\nsides of his ebony black head when he inclined it slowly at the end.\r\n\r\nChief Inspector Heat waited with the appearance of turning over in his\r\nmind all he had just said, but, as a matter of fact, considering the\r\nadvisability of saying something more.  The Assistant Commissioner cut\r\nhis hesitation short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe there were two men?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, without uncovering his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector thought it more than probable.  In his opinion, the\r\ntwo men had parted from each other within a hundred yards from the\r\nObservatory walls.  He explained also how the other man could have got\r\nout of the park speedily without being observed.  The fog, though not\r\nvery dense, was in his favour.  He seemed to have escorted the other to\r\nthe spot, and then to have left him there to do the job single-handed.\r\nTaking the time those two were seen coming out of Maze Hill Station by\r\nthe old woman, and the time when the explosion was heard, the Chief\r\nInspector thought that the other man might have been actually at the\r\nGreenwich Park Station, ready to catch the next train up, at the moment\r\nhis comrade was destroying himself so thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery thoroughly\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Assistant Commissioner from under the\r\nshadow of his hand.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector in a few vigorous words described the aspect of the\r\nremains.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe coroner\xe2\x80\x99s jury will have a treat,\xe2\x80\x9d he added grimly.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner uncovered his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have nothing to tell them,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked languidly.\r\n\r\nHe looked up, and for a time watched the markedly non-committal attitude\r\nof his Chief Inspector.  His nature was one that is not easily accessible\r\nto illusions.  He knew that a department is at the mercy of its\r\nsubordinate officers, who have their own conceptions of loyalty.  His\r\ncareer had begun in a tropical colony.  He had liked his work there.  It\r\nwas police work.  He had been very successful in tracking and breaking up\r\ncertain nefarious secret societies amongst the natives.  Then he took his\r\nlong leave, and got married rather impulsively.  It was a good match from\r\na worldly point of view, but his wife formed an unfavourable opinion of\r\nthe colonial climate on hearsay evidence.  On the other hand, she had\r\ninfluential connections.  It was an excellent match.  But he did not like\r\nthe work he had to do now.  He felt himself dependent on too many\r\nsubordinates and too many masters.  The near presence of that strange\r\nemotional phenomenon called public opinion weighed upon his spirits, and\r\nalarmed him by its irrational nature.  No doubt that from ignorance he\r\nexaggerated to himself its power for good and evil\xe2\x80\x94especially for evil;\r\nand the rough east winds of the English spring (which agreed with his\r\nwife) augmented his general mistrust of men\xe2\x80\x99s motives and of the\r\nefficiency of their organisation.  The futility of office work especially\r\nappalled him on those days so trying to his sensitive liver.\r\n\r\nHe got up, unfolding himself to his full height, and with a heaviness of\r\nstep remarkable in so slender a man, moved across the room to the window.\r\nThe panes streamed with rain, and the short street he looked down into\r\nlay wet and empty, as if swept clear suddenly by a great flood.  It was a\r\nvery trying day, choked in raw fog to begin with, and now drowned in cold\r\nrain.  The flickering, blurred flames of gas-lamps seemed to be\r\ndissolving in a watery atmosphere.  And the lofty pretensions of a\r\nmankind oppressed by the miserable indignities of the weather appeared as\r\na colossal and hopeless vanity deserving of scorn, wonder, and\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrible, horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the Assistant Commissioner to himself, with\r\nhis face near the window-pane.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been having this sort of thing\r\nnow for ten days; no, a fortnight\xe2\x80\x94a fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d  He ceased to think\r\ncompletely for a time.  That utter stillness of his brain lasted about\r\nthree seconds.  Then he said perfunctorily: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have set inquiries on\r\nfoot for tracing that other man up and down the line?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had no doubt that everything needful had been done.  Chief Inspector\r\nHeat knew, of course, thoroughly the business of man-hunting.  And these\r\nwere the routine steps, too, that would be taken as a matter of course by\r\nthe merest beginner.  A few inquiries amongst the ticket collectors and\r\nthe porters of the two small railway stations would give additional\r\ndetails as to the appearance of the two men; the inspection of the\r\ncollected tickets would show at once where they came from that morning.\r\nIt was elementary, and could not have been neglected.  Accordingly the\r\nChief Inspector answered that all this had been done directly the old\r\nwoman had come forward with her deposition.  And he mentioned the name of\r\na station.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where they came from, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe porter\r\nwho took the tickets at Maze Hill remembers two chaps answering to the\r\ndescription passing the barrier.  They seemed to him two respectable\r\nworking men of a superior sort\xe2\x80\x94sign painters or house decorators.  The\r\nbig man got out of a third-class compartment backward, with a bright tin\r\ncan in his hand.  On the platform he gave it to carry to the fair young\r\nfellow who followed him.  All this agrees exactly with what the old woman\r\ntold the police sergeant in Greenwich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner, still with his face turned to the window,\r\nexpressed his doubt as to these two men having had anything to do with\r\nthe outrage.  All this theory rested upon the utterances of an old\r\ncharwoman who had been nearly knocked down by a man in a hurry.  Not a\r\nvery substantial authority indeed, unless on the ground of sudden\r\ninspiration, which was hardly tenable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrankly now, could she have been really inspired?\xe2\x80\x9d he queried, with\r\ngrave irony, keeping his back to the room, as if entranced by the\r\ncontemplation of the town\xe2\x80\x99s colossal forms half lost in the night.  He\r\ndid not even look round when he heard the mutter of the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvidential\xe2\x80\x9d from the principal subordinate of his department, whose\r\nname, printed sometimes in the papers, was familiar to the great public\r\nas that of one of its zealous and hard-working protectors.  Chief\r\nInspector Heat raised his voice a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrips and bits of bright tin were quite visible to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good corroboration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these men came from that little country station,\xe2\x80\x9d the Assistant\r\nCommissioner mused aloud, wondering.  He was told that such was the name\r\non two tickets out of three given up out of that train at Maze Hill.  The\r\nthird person who got out was a hawker from Gravesend well known to the\r\nporters.  The Chief Inspector imparted that information in a tone of\r\nfinality with some ill humour, as loyal servants will do in the\r\nconsciousness of their fidelity and with the sense of the value of their\r\nloyal exertions.  And still the Assistant Commissioner did not turn away\r\nfrom the darkness outside, as vast as a sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo foreign anarchists coming from that place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, apparently to\r\nthe window-pane.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather unaccountable.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.  But it would be still more unaccountable if that Michaelis\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t staying in a cottage in the neighbourhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the sound of that name, falling unexpectedly into this annoying\r\naffair, the Assistant Commissioner dismissed brusquely the vague\r\nremembrance of his daily whist party at his club.  It was the most\r\ncomforting habit of his life, in a mainly successful display of his skill\r\nwithout the assistance of any subordinate.  He entered his club to play\r\nfrom five to seven, before going home to dinner, forgetting for those two\r\nhours whatever was distasteful in his life, as though the game were a\r\nbeneficent drug for allaying the pangs of moral discontent.  His partners\r\nwere the gloomily humorous editor of a celebrated magazine; a silent,\r\nelderly barrister with malicious little eyes; and a highly martial,\r\nsimple-minded old Colonel with nervous brown hands.  They were his club\r\nacquaintances merely.  He never met them elsewhere except at the\r\ncard-table.  But they all seemed to approach the game in the spirit of\r\nco-sufferers, as if it were indeed a drug against the secret ills of\r\nexistence; and every day as the sun declined over the countless roofs of\r\nthe town, a mellow, pleasurable impatience, resembling the impulse of a\r\nsure and profound friendship, lightened his professional labours.  And\r\nnow this pleasurable sensation went out of him with something resembling\r\na physical shock, and was replaced by a special kind of interest in his\r\nwork of social protection\xe2\x80\x94an improper sort of interest, which may be\r\ndefined best as a sudden and alert mistrust of the weapon in his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lady patroness of Michaelis, the ticket-of-leave apostle of\r\nhumanitarian hopes, was one of the most influential and distinguished\r\nconnections of the Assistant Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s wife, whom she called Annie,\r\nand treated still rather as a not very wise and utterly inexperienced\r\nyoung girl.  But she had consented to accept him on a friendly footing,\r\nwhich was by no means the case with all of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s influential\r\nconnections.  Married young and splendidly at some remote epoch of the\r\npast, she had had for a time a close view of great affairs and even of\r\nsome great men.  She herself was a great lady.  Old now in the number of\r\nher years, she had that sort of exceptional temperament which defies time\r\nwith scornful disregard, as if it were a rather vulgar convention\r\nsubmitted to by the mass of inferior mankind.  Many other conventions\r\neasier to set aside, alas! failed to obtain her recognition, also on\r\ntemperamental grounds\xe2\x80\x94either because they bored her, or else because they\r\nstood in the way of her scorns and sympathies.  Admiration was a\r\nsentiment unknown to her (it was one of the secret griefs of her most\r\nnoble husband against her)\xe2\x80\x94first, as always more or less tainted with\r\nmediocrity, and next as being in a way an admission of inferiority.  And\r\nboth were frankly inconceivable to her nature.  To be fearlessly\r\noutspoken in her opinions came easily to her, since she judged solely\r\nfrom the standpoint of her social position.  She was equally untrammelled\r\nin her actions; and as her tactfulness proceeded from genuine humanity,\r\nher bodily vigour remained remarkable and her superiority was serene and\r\ncordial, three generations had admired her infinitely, and the last she\r\nwas likely to see had pronounced her a wonderful woman.  Meantime\r\nintelligent, with a sort of lofty simplicity, and curious at heart, but\r\nnot like many women merely of social gossip, she amused her age by\r\nattracting within her ken through the power of her great, almost\r\nhistorical, social prestige everything that rose above the dead level of\r\nmankind, lawfully or unlawfully, by position, wit, audacity, fortune or\r\nmisfortune.  Royal Highnesses, artists, men of science, young statesmen,\r\nand charlatans of all ages and conditions, who, unsubstantial and light,\r\nbobbing up like corks, show best the direction of the surface currents,\r\nhad been welcomed in that house, listened to, penetrated, understood,\r\nappraised, for her own edification.  In her own words, she liked to watch\r\nwhat the world was coming to.  And as she had a practical mind her\r\njudgment of men and things, though based on special prejudices, was\r\nseldom totally wrong, and almost never wrong-headed.  Her drawing-room\r\nwas probably the only place in the wide world where an Assistant\r\nCommissioner of Police could meet a convict liberated on a\r\nticket-of-leave on other than professional and official ground.  Who had\r\nbrought Michaelis there one afternoon the Assistant Commissioner did not\r\nremember very well.  He had a notion it must have been a certain Member\r\nof Parliament of illustrious parentage and unconventional sympathies,\r\nwhich were the standing joke of the comic papers.  The notabilities and\r\neven the simple notorieties of the day brought each other freely to that\r\ntemple of an old woman\xe2\x80\x99s not ignoble curiosity.  You never could guess\r\nwhom you were likely to come upon being received in semi-privacy within\r\nthe faded blue silk and gilt frame screen, making a cosy nook for a couch\r\nand a few arm-chairs in the great drawing-room, with its hum of voices\r\nand the groups of people seated or standing in the light of six tall\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nMichaelis had been the object of a revulsion of popular sentiment, the\r\nsame sentiment which years ago had applauded the ferocity of the life\r\nsentence passed upon him for complicity in a rather mad attempt to rescue\r\nsome prisoners from a police van.  The plan of the conspirators had been\r\nto shoot down the horses and overpower the escort.  Unfortunately, one of\r\nthe police constables got shot too.  He left a wife and three small\r\nchildren, and the death of that man aroused through the length and\r\nbreadth of a realm for whose defence, welfare, and glory men die every\r\nday as matter of duty, an outburst of furious indignation, of a raging\r\nimplacable pity for the victim.  Three ring-leaders got hanged.\r\nMichaelis, young and slim, locksmith by trade, and great frequenter of\r\nevening schools, did not even know that anybody had been killed, his part\r\nwith a few others being to force open the door at the back of the special\r\nconveyance.  When arrested he had a bunch of skeleton keys in one pocket,\r\na heavy chisel in another, and a short crowbar in his hand: neither more\r\nnor less than a burglar.  But no burglar would have received such a heavy\r\nsentence.  The death of the constable had made him miserable at heart,\r\nbut the failure of the plot also.  He did not conceal either of these\r\nsentiments from his empanelled countrymen, and that sort of compunction\r\nappeared shockingly imperfect to the crammed court.  The judge on passing\r\nsentence commented feelingly upon the depravity and callousness of the\r\nyoung prisoner.\r\n\r\nThat made the groundless fame of his condemnation; the fame of his\r\nrelease was made for him on no better grounds by people who wished to\r\nexploit the sentimental aspect of his imprisonment either for purposes of\r\ntheir own or for no intelligible purpose.  He let them do so in the\r\ninnocence of his heart and the simplicity of his mind.  Nothing that\r\nhappened to him individually had any importance.  He was like those\r\nsaintly men whose personality is lost in the contemplation of their\r\nfaith.  His ideas were not in the nature of convictions.  They were\r\ninaccessible to reasoning.  They formed in all their contradictions and\r\nobscurities an invincible and humanitarian creed, which he confessed\r\nrather than preached, with an obstinate gentleness, a smile of pacific\r\nassurance on his lips, and his candid blue eyes cast down because the\r\nsight of faces troubled his inspiration developed in solitude.  In that\r\ncharacteristic attitude, pathetic in his grotesque and incurable obesity\r\nwhich he had to drag like a galley slave\xe2\x80\x99s bullet to the end of his days,\r\nthe Assistant Commissioner of Police beheld the ticket-of-leave apostle\r\nfilling a privileged arm-chair within the screen.  He sat there by the\r\nhead of the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s couch, mild-voiced and quiet, with no more\r\nself-consciousness than a very small child, and with something of a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s charm\xe2\x80\x94the appealing charm of trustfulness.  Confident of the\r\nfuture, whose secret ways had been revealed to him within the four walls\r\nof a well-known penitentiary, he had no reason to look with suspicion\r\nupon anybody.  If he could not give the great and curious lady a very\r\ndefinite idea as to what the world was coming to, he had managed without\r\neffort to impress her by his unembittered faith, by the sterling quality\r\nof his optimism.\r\n\r\nA certain simplicity of thought is common to serene souls at both ends of\r\nthe social scale.  The great lady was simple in her own way.  His views\r\nand beliefs had nothing in them to shock or startle her, since she judged\r\nthem from the standpoint of her lofty position.  Indeed, her sympathies\r\nwere easily accessible to a man of that sort.  She was not an exploiting\r\ncapitalist herself; she was, as it were, above the play of economic\r\nconditions.  And she had a great capacity of pity for the more obvious\r\nforms of common human miseries, precisely because she was such a complete\r\nstranger to them that she had to translate her conception into terms of\r\nmental suffering before she could grasp the notion of their cruelty.  The\r\nAssistant Commissioner remembered very well the conversation between\r\nthese two.  He had listened in silence.  It was something as exciting in\r\na way, and even touching in its foredoomed futility, as the efforts at\r\nmoral intercourse between the inhabitants of remote planets.  But this\r\ngrotesque incarnation of humanitarian passion appealed somehow, to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination.  At last Michaelis rose, and taking the great lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nextended hand, shook it, retained it for a moment in his great cushioned\r\npalm with unembarrassed friendliness, and turned upon the semi-private\r\nnook of the drawing-room his back, vast and square, and as if distended\r\nunder the short tweed jacket.  Glancing about in serene benevolence, he\r\nwaddled along to the distant door between the knots of other visitors.\r\nThe murmur of conversations paused on his passage.  He smiled innocently\r\nat a tall, brilliant girl, whose eyes met his accidentally, and went out\r\nunconscious of the glances following him across the room.  Michaelis\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfirst appearance in the world was a success\xe2\x80\x94a success of esteem unmarred\r\nby a single murmur of derision.  The interrupted conversations were\r\nresumed in their proper tone, grave or light.  Only a well-set-up,\r\nlong-limbed, active-looking man of forty talking with two ladies near a\r\nwindow remarked aloud, with an unexpected depth of feeling: \xe2\x80\x9cEighteen\r\nstone, I should say, and not five foot six.  Poor fellow!  It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nterrible\xe2\x80\x94terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady of the house, gazing absently at the Assistant Commissioner,\r\nleft alone with her on the private side of the screen, seemed to be\r\nrearranging her mental impressions behind her thoughtful immobility of a\r\nhandsome old face.  Men with grey moustaches and full, healthy, vaguely\r\nsmiling countenances approached, circling round the screen; two mature\r\nwomen with a matronly air of gracious resolution; a clean-shaved\r\nindividual with sunken cheeks, and dangling a gold-mounted eyeglass on a\r\nbroad black ribbon with an old-world, dandified effect.  A silence\r\ndeferential, but full of reserves, reigned for a moment, and then the\r\ngreat lady exclaimed, not with resentment, but with a sort of protesting\r\nindignation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that officially is supposed to be a revolutionist!  What nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe looked hard at the Assistant Commissioner, who murmured\r\napologetically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a dangerous one perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot dangerous\xe2\x80\x94I should think not indeed.  He is a mere believer.  It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe temperament of a saint,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the great lady in a firm tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they kept him shut up for twenty years.  One shudders at the\r\nstupidity of it.  And now they have let him out everybody belonging to\r\nhim is gone away somewhere or dead.  His parents are dead; the girl he\r\nwas to marry has died while he was in prison; he has lost the skill\r\nnecessary for his manual occupation.  He told me all this himself with\r\nthe sweetest patience; but then, he said, he had had plenty of time to\r\nthink out things for himself.  A pretty compensation!  If that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nstuff revolutionists are made of some of us may well go on their knees to\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued in a slightly bantering voice, while the banal\r\nsociety smiles hardened on the worldly faces turned towards her with\r\nconventional deference.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor creature is obviously no longer in a\r\nposition to take care of himself.  Somebody will have to look after him a\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe should be recommended to follow a treatment of some sort,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nsoldierly voice of the active-looking man was heard advising earnestly\r\nfrom a distance.  He was in the pink of condition for his age, and even\r\nthe texture of his long frock coat had a character of elastic soundness,\r\nas if it were a living tissue.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe man is virtually a cripple,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded with unmistakable feeling.\r\n\r\nOther voices, as if glad of the opening, murmured hasty compassion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite startling,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMonstrous,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMost painful to see.\xe2\x80\x9d  The lank man,\r\nwith the eyeglass on a broad ribbon, pronounced mincingly the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrotesque,\xe2\x80\x9d whose justness was appreciated by those standing near him.\r\nThey smiled at each other.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner had expressed no opinion either then or later,\r\nhis position making it impossible for him to ventilate any independent\r\nview of a ticket-of-leave convict.  But, in truth, he shared the view of\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s friend and patron that Michaelis was a humanitarian\r\nsentimentalist, a little mad, but upon the whole incapable of hurting a\r\nfly intentionally.  So when that name cropped up suddenly in this vexing\r\nbomb affair he realised all the danger of it for the ticket-of-leave\r\napostle, and his mind reverted at once to the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s well-established\r\ninfatuation.  Her arbitrary kindness would not brook patiently any\r\ninterference with Michaelis\xe2\x80\x99 freedom.  It was a deep, calm, convinced\r\ninfatuation.  She had not only felt him to be inoffensive, but she had\r\nsaid so, which last by a confusion of her absolutist mind became a sort\r\nof incontrovertible demonstration.  It was as if the monstrosity of the\r\nman, with his candid infant\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and a fat angelic smile, had\r\nfascinated her.  She had come to believe almost his theory of the future,\r\nsince it was not repugnant to her prejudices.  She disliked the new\r\nelement of plutocracy in the social compound, and industrialism as a\r\nmethod of human development appeared to her singularly repulsive in its\r\nmechanical and unfeeling character.  The humanitarian hopes of the mild\r\nMichaelis tended not towards utter destruction, but merely towards the\r\ncomplete economic ruin of the system.  And she did not really see where\r\nwas the moral harm of it.  It would do away with all the multitude of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cparvenus,\xe2\x80\x9d whom she disliked and mistrusted, not because they had\r\narrived anywhere (she denied that), but because of their profound\r\nunintelligence of the world, which was the primary cause of the crudity\r\nof their perceptions and the aridity of their hearts.  With the\r\nannihilation of all capital they would vanish too; but universal ruin\r\n(providing it was universal, as it was revealed to Michaelis) would leave\r\nthe social values untouched.  The disappearance of the last piece of\r\nmoney could not affect people of position.  She could not conceive how it\r\ncould affect her position, for instance.  She had developed these\r\ndiscoveries to the Assistant Commissioner with all the serene\r\nfearlessness of an old woman who had escaped the blight of indifference.\r\nHe had made for himself the rule to receive everything of that sort in a\r\nsilence which he took care from policy and inclination not to make\r\noffensive.  He had an affection for the aged disciple of Michaelis, a\r\ncomplex sentiment depending a little on her prestige, on her personality,\r\nbut most of all on the instinct of flattered gratitude.  He felt himself\r\nreally liked in her house.  She was kindness personified.  And she was\r\npractically wise too, after the manner of experienced women.  She made\r\nhis married life much easier than it would have been without her\r\ngenerously full recognition of his rights as Annie\xe2\x80\x99s husband.  Her\r\ninfluence upon his wife, a woman devoured by all sorts of small\r\nselfishnesses, small envies, small jealousies, was excellent.\r\nUnfortunately, both her kindness and her wisdom were of unreasonable\r\ncomplexion, distinctly feminine, and difficult to deal with.  She\r\nremained a perfect woman all along her full tale of years, and not as\r\nsome of them do become\xe2\x80\x94a sort of slippery, pestilential old man in\r\npetticoats.  And it was as of a woman that he thought of her\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nspecially choice incarnation of the feminine, wherein is recruited the\r\ntender, ingenuous, and fierce bodyguard for all sorts of men who talk\r\nunder the influence of an emotion, true or fraudulent; for preachers,\r\nseers, prophets, or reformers.\r\n\r\nAppreciating the distinguished and good friend of his wife, and himself,\r\nin that way, the Assistant Commissioner became alarmed at the convict\r\nMichaelis\xe2\x80\x99 possible fate.  Once arrested on suspicion of being in some\r\nway, however remote, a party to this outrage, the man could hardly escape\r\nbeing sent back to finish his sentence at least.  And that would kill\r\nhim; he would never come out alive.  The Assistant Commissioner made a\r\nreflection extremely unbecoming his official position without being\r\nreally creditable to his humanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the fellow is laid hold of again,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cshe will never\r\nforgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe frankness of such a secretly outspoken thought could not go without\r\nsome derisive self-criticism.  No man engaged in a work he does not like\r\ncan preserve many saving illusions about himself.  The distaste, the\r\nabsence of glamour, extend from the occupation to the personality.  It is\r\nonly when our appointed activities seem by a lucky accident to obey the\r\nparticular earnestness of our temperament that we can taste the comfort\r\nof complete self-deception.  The Assistant Commissioner did not like his\r\nwork at home.  The police work he had been engaged on in a distant part\r\nof the globe had the saving character of an irregular sort of warfare or\r\nat least the risk and excitement of open-air sport.  His real abilities,\r\nwhich were mainly of an administrative order, were combined with an\r\nadventurous disposition.  Chained to a desk in the thick of four millions\r\nof men, he considered himself the victim of an ironic fate\xe2\x80\x94the same, no\r\ndoubt, which had brought about his marriage with a woman exceptionally\r\nsensitive in the matter of colonial climate, besides other limitations\r\ntestifying to the delicacy of her nature\xe2\x80\x94and her tastes.  Though he\r\njudged his alarm sardonically he did not dismiss the improper thought\r\nfrom his mind.  The instinct of self-preservation was strong within him.\r\nOn the contrary, he repeated it mentally with profane emphasis and a\r\nfuller precision: \xe2\x80\x9cDamn it!  If that infernal Heat has his way the\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99ll die in prison smothered in his fat, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll never forgive\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis black, narrow figure, with the white band of the collar under the\r\nsilvery gleams on the close-cropped hair at the back of the head,\r\nremained motionless.  The silence had lasted such a long time that Chief\r\nInspector Heat ventured to clear his throat.  This noise produced its\r\neffect.  The zealous and intelligent officer was asked by his superior,\r\nwhose back remained turned to him immovably:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou connect Michaelis with this affair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChief Inspector Heat was very positive, but cautious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have enough to go upon.  A man like that has no\r\nbusiness to be at large, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will want some conclusive evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d came the observation in a\r\nmurmur.\r\n\r\nChief Inspector Heat raised his eyebrows at the black, narrow back, which\r\nremained obstinately presented to his intelligence and his zeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be no difficulty in getting up sufficient evidence against\r\n_him_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with virtuous complacency.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou may trust me for that,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, quite unnecessarily, out of the fulness of his heart; for\r\nit seemed to him an excellent thing to have that man in hand to be thrown\r\ndown to the public should it think fit to roar with any special\r\nindignation in this case.  It was impossible to say yet whether it would\r\nroar or not.  That in the last instance depended, of course, on the\r\nnewspaper press.  But in any case, Chief Inspector Heat, purveyor of\r\nprisons by trade, and a man of legal instincts, did logically believe\r\nthat incarceration was the proper fate for every declared enemy of the\r\nlaw.  In the strength of that conviction he committed a fault of tact.\r\nHe allowed himself a little conceited laugh, and repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me for that, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the forced calmness under which the Assistant\r\nCommissioner had for upwards of eighteen months concealed his irritation\r\nwith the system and the subordinates of his office.  A square peg forced\r\ninto a round hole, he had felt like a daily outrage that long established\r\nsmooth roundness into which a man of less sharply angular shape would\r\nhave fitted himself, with voluptuous acquiescence, after a shrug or two.\r\nWhat he resented most was just the necessity of taking so much on trust.\r\nAt the little laugh of Chief Inspector Heat\xe2\x80\x99s he spun swiftly on his\r\nheels, as if whirled away from the window-pane by an electric shock.  He\r\ncaught on the latter\xe2\x80\x99s face not only the complacency proper to the\r\noccasion lurking under the moustache, but the vestiges of experimental\r\nwatchfulness in the round eyes, which had been, no doubt, fastened on his\r\nback, and now met his glance for a second before the intent character of\r\ntheir stare had the time to change to a merely startled appearance.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner of Police had really some qualifications for\r\nhis post.  Suddenly his suspicion was awakened.  It is but fair to say\r\nthat his suspicions of the police methods (unless the police happened to\r\nbe a semi-military body organised by himself) was not difficult to\r\narouse.  If it ever slumbered from sheer weariness, it was but lightly;\r\nand his appreciation of Chief Inspector Heat\xe2\x80\x99s zeal and ability, moderate\r\nin itself, excluded all notion of moral confidence.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s up to\r\nsomething,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed mentally, and at once became angry.  Crossing\r\nover to his desk with headlong strides, he sat down violently.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere I\r\nam stuck in a litter of paper,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, with unreasonable\r\nresentment, \xe2\x80\x9csupposed to hold all the threads in my hands, and yet I can\r\nbut hold what is put in my hand, and nothing else.  And they can fasten\r\nthe other ends of the threads where they please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his head, and turned towards his subordinate a long, meagre\r\nface with the accentuated features of an energetic Don Quixote.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what is it you\xe2\x80\x99ve got up your sleeve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other stared.  He stared without winking in a perfect immobility of\r\nhis round eyes, as he was used to stare at the various members of the\r\ncriminal class when, after being duly cautioned, they made their\r\nstatements in the tones of injured innocence, or false simplicity, or\r\nsullen resignation.  But behind that professional and stony fixity there\r\nwas some surprise too, for in such a tone, combining nicely the note of\r\ncontempt and impatience, Chief Inspector Heat, the right-hand man of the\r\ndepartment, was not used to be addressed.  He began in a procrastinating\r\nmanner, like a man taken unawares by a new and unexpected experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve got against that man Michaelis you mean, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner watched the bullet head; the points of that\r\nNorse rover\xe2\x80\x99s moustache, falling below the line of the heavy jaw; the\r\nwhole full and pale physiognomy, whose determined character was marred by\r\ntoo much flesh; at the cunning wrinkles radiating from the outer corners\r\nof the eyes\xe2\x80\x94and in that purposeful contemplation of the valuable and\r\ntrusted officer he drew a conviction so sudden that it moved him like an\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reason to think that when you came into this room,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in\r\nmeasured tones, \xe2\x80\x9cit was not Michaelis who was in your mind; not\r\nprincipally\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have reason to think, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Chief Inspector Heat, with\r\nevery appearance of astonishment, which up to a certain point was genuine\r\nenough.  He had discovered in this affair a delicate and perplexing side,\r\nforcing upon the discoverer a certain amount of insincerity\xe2\x80\x94that sort of\r\ninsincerity which, under the names of skill, prudence, discretion, turns\r\nup at one point or another in most human affairs.  He felt at the moment\r\nlike a tight-rope artist might feel if suddenly, in the middle of the\r\nperformance, the manager of the Music Hall were to rush out of the proper\r\nmanagerial seclusion and begin to shake the rope.  Indignation, the sense\r\nof moral insecurity engendered by such a treacherous proceeding joined to\r\nthe immediate apprehension of a broken neck, would, in the colloquial\r\nphrase, put him in a state.  And there would be also some scandalised\r\nconcern for his art too, since a man must identify himself with something\r\nmore tangible than his own personality, and establish his pride\r\nsomewhere, either in his social position, or in the quality of the work\r\nhe is obliged to do, or simply in the superiority of the idleness he may\r\nbe fortunate enough to enjoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Assistant Commissioner; \xe2\x80\x9cI have.  I do not mean to say\r\nthat you have not thought of Michaelis at all.  But you are giving the\r\nfact you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned a prominence which strikes me as not quite candid,\r\nInspector Heat.  If that is really the track of discovery, why haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou followed it up at once, either personally or by sending one of your\r\nmen to that village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think, sir, I have failed in my duty there?\xe2\x80\x9d the Chief Inspector\r\nasked, in a tone which he sought to make simply reflective.  Forced\r\nunexpectedly to concentrate his faculties upon the task of preserving his\r\nbalance, he had seized upon that point, and exposed himself to a rebuke;\r\nfor, the Assistant Commissioner frowning slightly, observed that this was\r\na very improper remark to make.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut since you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that this\r\nis not my meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, with a straight glance of his sunken eyes which was a full\r\nequivalent of the unspoken termination \xe2\x80\x9cand you know it.\xe2\x80\x9d  The head of\r\nthe so-called Special Crimes Department debarred by his position from\r\ngoing out of doors personally in quest of secrets locked up in guilty\r\nbreasts, had a propensity to exercise his considerable gifts for the\r\ndetection of incriminating truth upon his own subordinates.  That\r\npeculiar instinct could hardly be called a weakness.  It was natural.  He\r\nwas a born detective.  It had unconsciously governed his choice of a\r\ncareer, and if it ever failed him in life it was perhaps in the one\r\nexceptional circumstance of his marriage\xe2\x80\x94which was also natural.  It fed,\r\nsince it could not roam abroad, upon the human material which was brought\r\nto it in its official seclusion.  We can never cease to be ourselves.\r\n\r\nHis elbow on the desk, his thin legs crossed, and nursing his cheek in\r\nthe palm of his meagre hand, the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the\r\nSpecial Crimes branch was getting hold of the case with growing interest.\r\nHis Chief Inspector, if not an absolutely worthy foeman of his\r\npenetration, was at any rate the most worthy of all within his reach.  A\r\nmistrust of established reputations was strictly in character with the\r\nAssistant Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s ability as detector.  His memory evoked a\r\ncertain old fat and wealthy native chief in the distant colony whom it\r\nwas a tradition for the successive Colonial Governors to trust and make\r\nmuch of as a firm friend and supporter of the order and legality\r\nestablished by white men; whereas, when examined sceptically, he was\r\nfound out to be principally his own good friend, and nobody else\xe2\x80\x99s.  Not\r\nprecisely a traitor, but still a man of many dangerous reservations in\r\nhis fidelity, caused by a due regard for his own advantage, comfort, and\r\nsafety.  A fellow of some innocence in his naive duplicity, but none the\r\nless dangerous.  He took some finding out.  He was physically a big man,\r\ntoo, and (allowing for the difference of colour, of course) Chief\r\nInspector Heat\xe2\x80\x99s appearance recalled him to the memory of his superior.\r\nIt was not the eyes nor yet the lips exactly.  It was bizarre.  But does\r\nnot Alfred Wallace relate in his famous book on the Malay Archipelago\r\nhow, amongst the Aru Islanders, he discovered in an old and naked savage\r\nwith a sooty skin a peculiar resemblance to a dear friend at home?\r\n\r\nFor the first time since he took up his appointment the Assistant\r\nCommissioner felt as if he were going to do some real work for his\r\nsalary.  And that was a pleasurable sensation.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll turn him inside out\r\nlike an old glove,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the Assistant Commissioner, with his eyes\r\nresting pensively upon Chief Inspector Heat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that was not my thought,\xe2\x80\x9d he began again.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt about\r\nyou knowing your business\xe2\x80\x94no doubt at all; and that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe stopped short, and changing his tone: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could you bring up against\r\nMichaelis of a definite nature?  I mean apart from the fact that the two\r\nmen under suspicion\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re certain there were two of them\xe2\x80\x94came last from\r\na railway station within three miles of the village where Michaelis is\r\nliving now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis by itself is enough for us to go upon, sir, with that sort of man,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Chief Inspector, with returning composure.  The slight approving\r\nmovement of the Assistant Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s head went far to pacify the\r\nresentful astonishment of the renowned officer.  For Chief Inspector Heat\r\nwas a kind man, an excellent husband, a devoted father; and the public\r\nand departmental confidence he enjoyed acting favourably upon an amiable\r\nnature, disposed him to feel friendly towards the successive Assistant\r\nCommissioners he had seen pass through that very room.  There had been\r\nthree in his time.  The first one, a soldierly, abrupt, red-faced person,\r\nwith white eyebrows and an explosive temper, could be managed with a\r\nsilken thread.  He left on reaching the age limit.  The second, a perfect\r\ngentleman, knowing his own and everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s place to a nicety, on\r\nresigning to take up a higher appointment out of England got decorated\r\nfor (really) Inspector Heat\xe2\x80\x99s services.  To work with him had been a\r\npride and a pleasure.  The third, a bit of a dark horse from the first,\r\nwas at the end of eighteen months something of a dark horse still to the\r\ndepartment.  Upon the whole Chief Inspector Heat believed him to be in\r\nthe main harmless\xe2\x80\x94odd-looking, but harmless.  He was speaking now, and\r\nthe Chief Inspector listened with outward deference (which means nothing,\r\nbeing a matter of duty) and inwardly with benevolent toleration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichaelis reported himself before leaving London for the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.  He did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what may he be doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Assistant Commissioner,\r\nwho was perfectly informed on that point.  Fitted with painful tightness\r\ninto an old wooden arm-chair, before a worm-eaten oak table in an\r\nupstairs room of a four-roomed cottage with a roof of moss-grown tiles,\r\nMichaelis was writing night and day in a shaky, slanting hand that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAutobiography of a Prisoner\xe2\x80\x9d which was to be like a book of Revelation\r\nin the history of mankind.  The conditions of confined space, seclusion,\r\nand solitude in a small four-roomed cottage were favourable to his\r\ninspiration.  It was like being in prison, except that one was never\r\ndisturbed for the odious purpose of taking exercise according to the\r\ntyrannical regulations of his old home in the penitentiary.  He could not\r\ntell whether the sun still shone on the earth or not.  The perspiration\r\nof the literary labour dropped from his brow.  A delightful enthusiasm\r\nurged him on.  It was the liberation of his inner life, the letting out\r\nof his soul into the wide world.  And the zeal of his guileless vanity\r\n(first awakened by the offer of five hundred pounds from a publisher)\r\nseemed something predestined and holy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be, of course, most desirable to be informed exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted\r\nthe Assistant Commissioner uncandidly.\r\n\r\nChief Inspector Heat, conscious of renewed irritation at this display of\r\nscrupulousness, said that the county police had been notified from the\r\nfirst of Michaelis\xe2\x80\x99 arrival, and that a full report could be obtained in\r\na few hours.  A wire to the superintendent\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThus he spoke, rather slowly, while his mind seemed already to be\r\nweighing the consequences.  A slight knitting of the brow was the outward\r\nsign of this.  But he was interrupted by a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve sent that wire already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, as if surprised.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner uncrossed his legs suddenly.  The briskness of\r\nthat movement contrasted with the casual way in which he threw out a\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you think that Michaelis had anything to do with the preparation\r\nof that bomb, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector assumed a reflective manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say so.  There\xe2\x80\x99s no necessity to say anything at present.  He\r\nassociates with men who are classed as dangerous.  He was made a delegate\r\nof the Red Committee less than a year after his release on licence.  A\r\nsort of compliment, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the Chief Inspector laughed a little angrily, a little scornfully.\r\nWith a man of that sort scrupulousness was a misplaced and even an\r\nillegal sentiment.  The celebrity bestowed upon Michaelis on his release\r\ntwo years ago by some emotional journalists in want of special copy had\r\nrankled ever since in his breast.  It was perfectly legal to arrest that\r\nman on the barest suspicion.  It was legal and expedient on the face of\r\nit.  His two former chiefs would have seen the point at once; whereas\r\nthis one, without saying either yes or no, sat there, as if lost in a\r\ndream.  Moreover, besides being legal and expedient, the arrest of\r\nMichaelis solved a little personal difficulty which worried Chief\r\nInspector Heat somewhat.  This difficulty had its bearing upon his\r\nreputation, upon his comfort, and even upon the efficient performance of\r\nhis duties.  For, if Michaelis no doubt knew something about this\r\noutrage, the Chief Inspector was fairly certain that he did not know too\r\nmuch.  This was just as well.  He knew much less\xe2\x80\x94the Chief Inspector was\r\npositive\xe2\x80\x94than certain other individuals he had in his mind, but whose\r\narrest seemed to him inexpedient, besides being a more complicated\r\nmatter, on account of the rules of the game.  The rules of the game did\r\nnot protect so much Michaelis, who was an ex-convict.  It would be stupid\r\nnot to take advantage of legal facilities, and the journalists who had\r\nwritten him up with emotional gush would be ready to write him down with\r\nemotional indignation.\r\n\r\nThis prospect, viewed with confidence, had the attraction of a personal\r\ntriumph for Chief Inspector Heat.  And deep down in his blameless bosom\r\nof an average married citizen, almost unconscious but potent\r\nnevertheless, the dislike of being compelled by events to meddle with the\r\ndesperate ferocity of the Professor had its say.  This dislike had been\r\nstrengthened by the chance meeting in the lane.  The encounter did not\r\nleave behind with Chief Inspector Heat that satisfactory sense of\r\nsuperiority the members of the police force get from the unofficial but\r\nintimate side of their intercourse with the criminal classes, by which\r\nthe vanity of power is soothed, and the vulgar love of domination over\r\nour fellow-creatures is flattered as worthily as it deserves.\r\n\r\nThe perfect anarchist was not recognised as a fellow-creature by Chief\r\nInspector Heat.  He was impossible\xe2\x80\x94a mad dog to be left alone.  Not that\r\nthe Chief Inspector was afraid of him; on the contrary, he meant to have\r\nhim some day.  But not yet; he meant to get hold of him in his own time,\r\nproperly and effectively according to the rules of the game.  The present\r\nwas not the right time for attempting that feat, not the right time for\r\nmany reasons, personal and of public service.  This being the strong\r\nfeeling of Inspector Heat, it appeared to him just and proper that this\r\naffair should be shunted off its obscure and inconvenient track, leading\r\ngoodness knows where, into a quiet (and lawful) siding called Michaelis.\r\nAnd he repeated, as if reconsidering the suggestion conscientiously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bomb.  No, I would not say that exactly.  We may never find that\r\nout.  But it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that he is connected with this in some way, which we\r\ncan find out without much trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis countenance had that look of grave, overbearing indifference once\r\nwell known and much dreaded by the better sort of thieves.  Chief\r\nInspector Heat, though what is called a man, was not a smiling animal.\r\nBut his inward state was that of satisfaction at the passively receptive\r\nattitude of the Assistant Commissioner, who murmured gently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you really think that the investigation should be made in that\r\ndirection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite convinced?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, sir.  That\xe2\x80\x99s the true line for us to take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner withdrew the support of his hand from his\r\nreclining head with a suddenness that, considering his languid attitude,\r\nseemed to menace his whole person with collapse.  But, on the contrary,\r\nhe sat up, extremely alert, behind the great writing-table on which his\r\nhand had fallen with the sound of a sharp blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want to know is what put it out of your head till now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it out of my head,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Chief Inspector very slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  Till you were called into this room\xe2\x80\x94you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector felt as if the air between his clothing and his skin\r\nhad become unpleasantly hot.  It was the sensation of an unprecedented\r\nand incredible experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, exaggerating the deliberation of his utterance to\r\nthe utmost limits of possibility, \xe2\x80\x9cif there is a reason, of which I know\r\nnothing, for not interfering with the convict Michaelis, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust as well I didn\xe2\x80\x99t start the county police after him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis took such a long time to say that the unflagging attention of the\r\nAssistant Commissioner seemed a wonderful feat of endurance.  His retort\r\ncame without delay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo reason whatever that I know of.  Come, Chief Inspector, this\r\nfinessing with me is highly improper on your part\xe2\x80\x94highly improper.  And\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s also unfair, you know.  You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me to puzzle things out\r\nfor myself like this.  Really, I am surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, then added smoothly: \xe2\x80\x9cI need scarcely tell you that this\r\nconversation is altogether unofficial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were far from pacifying the Chief Inspector.  The indignation\r\nof a betrayed tight-rope performer was strong within him.  In his pride\r\nof a trusted servant he was affected by the assurance that the rope was\r\nnot shaken for the purpose of breaking his neck, as by an exhibition of\r\nimpudence.  As if anybody were afraid!  Assistant Commissioners come and\r\ngo, but a valuable Chief Inspector is not an ephemeral office phenomenon.\r\nHe was not afraid of getting a broken neck.  To have his performance\r\nspoiled was more than enough to account for the glow of honest\r\nindignation.  And as thought is no respecter of persons, the thought of\r\nChief Inspector Heat took a threatening and prophetic shape.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou, my\r\nboy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, keeping his round and habitually roving eyes\r\nfastened upon the Assistant Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou, my boy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow your place, and your place won\xe2\x80\x99t know you very long either, I bet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if in provoking answer to that thought, something like the ghost of an\r\namiable smile passed on the lips of the Assistant Commissioner.  His\r\nmanner was easy and business-like while he persisted in administering\r\nanother shake to the tight rope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us come now to what you have discovered on the spot, Chief\r\nInspector,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fool and his job are soon parted,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the train of prophetic\r\nthought in Chief Inspector Heat\xe2\x80\x99s head.  But it was immediately followed\r\nby the reflection that a higher official, even when \xe2\x80\x9cfired out\xe2\x80\x9d (this was\r\nthe precise image), has still the time as he flies through the door to\r\nlaunch a nasty kick at the shin-bones of a subordinate.  Without\r\nsoftening very much the basilisk nature of his stare, he said\r\nimpassively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are coming to that part of my investigation, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right.  Well, what have you brought away from it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector, who had made up his mind to jump off the rope, came\r\nto the ground with gloomy frankness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve brought away an address,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pulling out of his pocket\r\nwithout haste a singed rag of dark blue cloth.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis belongs to the\r\novercoat the fellow who got himself blown to pieces was wearing.  Of\r\ncourse, the overcoat may not have been his, and may even have been\r\nstolen.  But that\xe2\x80\x99s not at all probable if you look at this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector, stepping up to the table, smoothed out carefully the\r\nrag of blue cloth.  He had picked it up from the repulsive heap in the\r\nmortuary, because a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s name is found sometimes under the collar.\r\nIt is not often of much use, but still\xe2\x80\x94He only half expected to find\r\nanything useful, but certainly he did not expect to find\xe2\x80\x94not under the\r\ncollar at all, but stitched carefully on the under side of the lapel\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsquare piece of calico with an address written on it in marking ink.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector removed his smoothing hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI carried it off with me without anybody taking notice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought it best.  It can always be produced if required.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner, rising a little in his chair, pulled the\r\ncloth over to his side of the table.  He sat looking at it in silence.\r\nOnly the number 32 and the name of Brett Street were written in marking\r\nink on a piece of calico slightly larger than an ordinary cigarette\r\npaper.  He was genuinely surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t understand why he should have gone about labelled like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, looking up at Chief Inspector Heat.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a most extraordinary\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met once in the smoking-room of a hotel an old gentleman who went\r\nabout with his name and address sewn on in all his coats in case of an\r\naccident or sudden illness,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chief Inspector.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe professed to\r\nbe eighty-four years old, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look his age.  He told me he was\r\nalso afraid of losing his memory suddenly, like those people he has been\r\nreading of in the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA question from the Assistant Commissioner, who wanted to know what was\r\nNo. 32 Brett Street, interrupted that reminiscence abruptly.  The Chief\r\nInspector, driven down to the ground by unfair artifices, had elected to\r\nwalk the path of unreserved openness.  If he believed firmly that to know\r\ntoo much was not good for the department, the judicious holding back of\r\nknowledge was as far as his loyalty dared to go for the good of the\r\nservice.  If the Assistant Commissioner wanted to mismanage this affair\r\nnothing, of course, could prevent him.  But, on his own part, he now saw\r\nno reason for a display of alacrity.  So he answered concisely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a shop, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner, with his eyes lowered on the rag of blue\r\ncloth, waited for more information.  As that did not come he proceeded to\r\nobtain it by a series of questions propounded with gentle patience.  Thus\r\nhe acquired an idea of the nature of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s commerce, of his\r\npersonal appearance, and heard at last his name.  In a pause the\r\nAssistant Commissioner raised his eyes, and discovered some animation on\r\nthe Chief Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s face.  They looked at each other in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cthe department has no record of that man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid any of my predecessors have any knowledge of what you have told me\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Assistant Commissioner, putting his elbows on the table\r\nand raising his joined hands before his face, as if about to offer\r\nprayer, only that his eyes had not a pious expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; certainly not.  What would have been the object?  That sort of\r\nman could never be produced publicly to any good purpose.  It was\r\nsufficient for me to know who he was, and to make use of him in a way\r\nthat could be used publicly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you think that sort of private knowledge consistent with the\r\nofficial position you occupy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, sir.  I think it\xe2\x80\x99s quite proper.  I will take the liberty to\r\ntell you, sir, that it makes me what I am\xe2\x80\x94and I am looked upon as a man\r\nwho knows his work.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a private affair of my own.  A personal friend\r\nof mine in the French police gave me the hint that the fellow was an\r\nEmbassy spy.  Private friendship, private information, private use of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s how I look upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner after remarking to himself that the mental\r\nstate of the renowned Chief Inspector seemed to affect the outline of his\r\nlower jaw, as if the lively sense of his high professional distinction\r\nhad been located in that part of his anatomy, dismissed the point for the\r\nmoment with a calm \xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d  Then leaning his cheek on his joined hands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then\xe2\x80\x94speaking privately if you like\xe2\x80\x94how long have you been in\r\nprivate touch with this Embassy spy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this inquiry the private answer of the Chief Inspector, so private\r\nthat it was never shaped into audible words, was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong before you were even thought of for your place here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe so-to-speak public utterance was much more precise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him for the first time in my life a little more than seven years\r\nago, when two Imperial Highnesses and the Imperial Chancellor were on a\r\nvisit here.  I was put in charge of all the arrangements for looking\r\nafter them.  Baron Stott-Wartenheim was Ambassador then.  He was a very\r\nnervous old gentleman.  One evening, three days before the Guildhall\r\nBanquet, he sent word that he wanted to see me for a moment.  I was\r\ndownstairs, and the carriages were at the door to take the Imperial\r\nHighnesses and the Chancellor to the opera.  I went up at once.  I found\r\nthe Baron walking up and down his bedroom in a pitiable state of\r\ndistress, squeezing his hands together.  He assured me he had the fullest\r\nconfidence in our police and in my abilities, but he had there a man just\r\ncome over from Paris whose information could be trusted implicity.  He\r\nwanted me to hear what that man had to say.  He took me at once into a\r\ndressing-room next door, where I saw a big fellow in a heavy overcoat\r\nsitting all alone on a chair, and holding his hat and stick in one hand.\r\nThe Baron said to him in French \xe2\x80\x98Speak, my friend.\xe2\x80\x99  The light in that\r\nroom was not very good.  I talked with him for some five minutes perhaps.\r\nHe certainly gave me a piece of very startling news.  Then the Baron took\r\nme aside nervously to praise him up to me, and when I turned round again\r\nI discovered that the fellow had vanished like a ghost.  Got up and\r\nsneaked out down some back stairs, I suppose.  There was no time to run\r\nafter him, as I had to hurry off after the Ambassador down the great\r\nstaircase, and see the party started safe for the opera.  However, I\r\nacted upon the information that very night.  Whether it was perfectly\r\ncorrect or not, it did look serious enough.  Very likely it saved us from\r\nan ugly trouble on the day of the Imperial visit to the City.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome time later, a month or so after my promotion to Chief Inspector, my\r\nattention was attracted to a big burly man, I thought I had seen\r\nsomewhere before, coming out in a hurry from a jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s shop in the\r\nStrand.  I went after him, as it was on my way towards Charing Cross, and\r\nthere seeing one of our detectives across the road, I beckoned him over,\r\nand pointed out the fellow to him, with instructions to watch his\r\nmovements for a couple of days, and then report to me.  No later than\r\nnext afternoon my man turned up to tell me that the fellow had married\r\nhis landlady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter at a registrar\xe2\x80\x99s office that very day at 11.30\r\na.m., and had gone off with her to Margate for a week.  Our man had seen\r\nthe luggage being put on the cab.  There were some old Paris labels on\r\none of the bags.  Somehow I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the fellow out of my head, and\r\nthe very next time I had to go to Paris on service I spoke about him to\r\nthat friend of mine in the Paris police.  My friend said: \xe2\x80\x98From what you\r\ntell me I think you must mean a rather well-known hanger-on and emissary\r\nof the Revolutionary Red Committee.  He says he is an Englishman by\r\nbirth.  We have an idea that he has been for a good few years now a\r\nsecret agent of one of the foreign Embassies in London.\xe2\x80\x99  This woke up my\r\nmemory completely.  He was the vanishing fellow I saw sitting on a chair\r\nin Baron Stott-Wartenheim\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom.  I told my friend that he was quite\r\nright.  The fellow was a secret agent to my certain knowledge.\r\nAfterwards my friend took the trouble to ferret out the complete record\r\nof that man for me.  I thought I had better know all there was to know;\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you want to hear his history now, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner shook his supported head.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe history of\r\nyour relations with that useful personage is the only thing that matters\r\njust now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, closing slowly his weary, deep-set eyes, and then\r\nopening them swiftly with a greatly refreshed glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing official about them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chief Inspector bitterly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went into his shop one evening, told him who I was, and reminded him\r\nof our first meeting.  He didn\xe2\x80\x99t as much as twitch an eyebrow.  He said\r\nthat he was married and settled now, and that all he wanted was not to be\r\ninterfered in his little business.  I took it upon myself to promise him\r\nthat, as long as he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go in for anything obviously outrageous, he\r\nwould be left alone by the police.  That was worth something to him,\r\nbecause a word from us to the Custom-House people would have been enough\r\nto get some of these packages he gets from Paris and Brussels opened in\r\nDover, with confiscation to follow for certain, and perhaps a prosecution\r\nas well at the end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very precarious trade,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Assistant Commissioner.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he go in for that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector raised scornful eyebrows dispassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost likely got a connection\xe2\x80\x94friends on the Continent\xe2\x80\x94amongst people who\r\ndeal in such wares.  They would be just the sort he would consort with.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s a lazy dog, too\xe2\x80\x94like the rest of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you get from him in exchange for your protection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector was not inclined to enlarge on the value of Mr\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s services.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would not be much good to anybody but myself.  One has got to know a\r\ngood deal beforehand to make use of a man like that.  I can understand\r\nthe sort of hint he can give.  And when I want a hint he can generally\r\nfurnish it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector lost himself suddenly in a discreet reflective mood;\r\nand the Assistant Commissioner repressed a smile at the fleeting thought\r\nthat the reputation of Chief Inspector Heat might possibly have been made\r\nin a great part by the Secret Agent Verloc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a more general way of being of use, all our men of the Special Crimes\r\nsection on duty at Charing Cross and Victoria have orders to take careful\r\nnotice of anybody they may see with him.  He meets the new arrivals\r\nfrequently, and afterwards keeps track of them.  He seems to have been\r\ntold off for that sort of duty.  When I want an address in a hurry, I can\r\nalways get it from him.  Of course, I know how to manage our relations.\r\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him to speak to three times in the last two years.  I drop\r\nhim a line, unsigned, and he answers me in the same way at my private\r\naddress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the Assistant Commissioner gave an almost imperceptible\r\nnod.  The Chief Inspector added that he did not suppose Mr Verloc to be\r\ndeep in the confidence of the prominent members of the Revolutionary\r\nInternational Council, but that he was generally trusted of that there\r\ncould be no doubt.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve had reason to think there was\r\nsomething in the wind,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always found he could tell me\r\nsomething worth knowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner made a significant remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe failed you this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither had I wind of anything in any other way,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Chief\r\nInspector Heat.  \xe2\x80\x9cI asked him nothing, so he could tell me nothing.  He\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t one of our men.  It isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if he were in our pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the Assistant Commissioner.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a spy in the pay of a\r\nforeign government.  We could never confess to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do my work in my own way,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the Chief Inspector.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nit comes to that I would deal with the devil himself, and take the\r\nconsequences.  There are things not fit for everybody to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour idea of secrecy seems to consist in keeping the chief of your\r\ndepartment in the dark.  That\xe2\x80\x99s stretching it perhaps a little too far,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it?  He lives over his shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94Verloc?  Oh yes.  He lives over his shop.  The wife\xe2\x80\x99s mother, I\r\nfancy, lives with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the house watched?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no.  It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do.  Certain people who come there are\r\nwatched.  My opinion is that he knows nothing of this affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you account for this?\xe2\x80\x9d  The Assistant Commissioner nodded at the\r\ncloth rag lying before him on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t account for it at all, sir.  It\xe2\x80\x99s simply unaccountable.  It\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be explained by what I know.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Chief Inspector made those\r\nadmissions with the frankness of a man whose reputation is established as\r\nif on a rock.  \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate not at this present moment.  I think that the\r\nman who had most to do with it will turn out to be Michaelis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; because I can answer for all the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about that other man supposed to have escaped from the park?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think he\xe2\x80\x99s far away by this time,\xe2\x80\x9d opined the Chief Inspector.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner looked hard at him, and rose suddenly, as\r\nthough having made up his mind to some course of action.  As a matter of\r\nfact, he had that very moment succumbed to a fascinating temptation.  The\r\nChief Inspector heard himself dismissed with instructions to meet his\r\nsuperior early next morning for further consultation upon the case.  He\r\nlistened with an impenetrable face, and walked out of the room with\r\nmeasured steps.\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been the plans of the Assistant Commissioner they had\r\nnothing to do with that desk work, which was the bane of his existence\r\nbecause of its confined nature and apparent lack of reality.  It could\r\nnot have had, or else the general air of alacrity that came upon the\r\nAssistant Commissioner would have been inexplicable.  As soon as he was\r\nleft alone he looked for his hat impulsively, and put it on his head.\r\nHaving done that, he sat down again to reconsider the whole matter.  But\r\nas his mind was already made up, this did not take long.  And before\r\nChief Inspector Heat had gone very far on the way home, he also left the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner walked along a short and narrow street like a\r\nwet, muddy trench, then crossing a very broad thoroughfare entered a\r\npublic edifice, and sought speech with a young private secretary (unpaid)\r\nof a great personage.\r\n\r\nThis fair, smooth-faced young man, whose symmetrically arranged hair gave\r\nhim the air of a large and neat schoolboy, met the Assistant\r\nCommissioner\xe2\x80\x99s request with a doubtful look, and spoke with bated breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould he see you?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that.  He has walked over from the\r\nHouse an hour ago to talk with the permanent Under-Secretary, and now\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s ready to walk back again.  He might have sent for him; but he does\r\nit for the sake of a little exercise, I suppose.  It\xe2\x80\x99s all the exercise\r\nhe can find time for while this session lasts.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain; I\r\nrather enjoy these little strolls.  He leans on my arm, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t open\r\nhis lips.  But, I say, he\xe2\x80\x99s very tired, and\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94not in the sweetest of\r\ntempers just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in connection with that Greenwich affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  I say!  He\xe2\x80\x99s very bitter against you people.  But I will go and\r\nsee, if you insist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Assistant Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe unpaid secretary admired this pluck.  Composing for himself an\r\ninnocent face, he opened a door, and went in with the assurance of a nice\r\nand privileged child.  And presently he reappeared, with a nod to the\r\nAssistant Commissioner, who passing through the same door left open for\r\nhim, found himself with the great personage in a large room.\r\n\r\nVast in bulk and stature, with a long white face, which, broadened at the\r\nbase by a big double chin, appeared egg-shaped in the fringe of thin\r\ngreyish whisker, the great personage seemed an expanding man.\r\nUnfortunate from a tailoring point of view, the cross-folds in the middle\r\nof a buttoned black coat added to the impression, as if the fastenings of\r\nthe garment were tried to the utmost.  From the head, set upward on a\r\nthick neck, the eyes, with puffy lower lids, stared with a haughty droop\r\non each side of a hooked aggressive nose, nobly salient in the vast pale\r\ncircumference of the face.  A shiny silk hat and a pair of worn gloves\r\nlying ready on the end of a long table looked expanded too, enormous.\r\n\r\nHe stood on the hearthrug in big, roomy boots, and uttered no word of\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to know if this is the beginning of another dynamite\r\ncampaign,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at once in a deep, very smooth voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go into\r\ndetails.  I have no time for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s figure before this big and rustic Presence\r\nhad the frail slenderness of a reed addressing an oak.  And indeed the\r\nunbroken record of that man\xe2\x80\x99s descent surpassed in the number of\r\ncenturies the age of the oldest oak in the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  As far as one can be positive about anything I can assure you that\r\nit is not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  But your idea of assurances over there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the great man, with\r\na contemptuous wave of his hand towards a window giving on the broad\r\nthoroughfare, \xe2\x80\x9cseems to consist mainly in making the Secretary of State\r\nlook a fool.  I have been told positively in this very room less than a\r\nmonth ago that nothing of the sort was even possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner glanced in the direction of the window calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will allow me to remark, Sir Ethelred, that so far I have had no\r\nopportunity to give you assurances of any kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe haughty droop of the eyes was focussed now upon the Assistant\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed the deep, smooth voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cI sent for Heat.  You are\r\nstill rather a novice in your new berth.  And how are you getting on over\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I am learning something every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, of course.  I hope you will get on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sir Ethelred.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned something to-day, and even within\r\nthe last hour or so.  There is much in this affair of a kind that does\r\nnot meet the eye in a usual anarchist outrage, even if one looked into it\r\nas deep as can be.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great man put his arms akimbo, the backs of his big hands resting on\r\nhis hips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.  Go on.  Only no details, pray.  Spare me the details.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not be troubled with them, Sir Ethelred,\xe2\x80\x9d the Assistant\r\nCommissioner began, with a calm and untroubled assurance.  While he was\r\nspeaking the hands on the face of the clock behind the great man\xe2\x80\x99s back\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nheavy, glistening affair of massive scrolls in the same dark marble as\r\nthe mantelpiece, and with a ghostly, evanescent tick\xe2\x80\x94had moved through\r\nthe space of seven minutes.  He spoke with a studious fidelity to a\r\nparenthetical manner, into which every little fact\xe2\x80\x94that is, every\r\ndetail\xe2\x80\x94fitted with delightful ease.  Not a murmur nor even a movement\r\nhinted at interruption.  The great Personage might have been the statue\r\nof one of his own princely ancestors stripped of a crusader\xe2\x80\x99s war\r\nharness, and put into an ill-fitting frock coat.  The Assistant\r\nCommissioner felt as though he were at liberty to talk for an hour.  But\r\nhe kept his head, and at the end of the time mentioned above he broke off\r\nwith a sudden conclusion, which, reproducing the opening statement,\r\npleasantly surprised Sir Ethelred by its apparent swiftness and force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe kind of thing which meets us under the surface of this affair,\r\notherwise without gravity, is unusual\xe2\x80\x94in this precise form at least\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nrequires special treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone of Sir Ethelred was deepened, full of conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so\xe2\x80\x94involving the Ambassador of a foreign power!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  The Ambassador!\xe2\x80\x9d protested the other, erect and slender, allowing\r\nhimself a mere half smile.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be stupid of me to advance anything\r\nof the kind.  And it is absolutely unnecessary, because if I am right in\r\nmy surmises, whether ambassador or hall porter it\xe2\x80\x99s a mere detail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Ethelred opened a wide mouth, like a cavern, into which the hooked\r\nnose seemed anxious to peer; there came from it a subdued rolling sound,\r\nas from a distant organ with the scornful indignation stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!  These people are too impossible.  What do they mean by importing\r\ntheir methods of Crim-Tartary here?  A Turk would have more decency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget, Sir Ethelred, that strictly speaking we know nothing\r\npositively\xe2\x80\x94as yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!  But how would you define it?  Shortly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarefaced audacity amounting to childishness of a peculiar sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t put up with the innocence of nasty little children,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ngreat and expanded personage, expanding a little more, as it were.  The\r\nhaughty drooping glance struck crushingly the carpet at the Assistant\r\nCommissioner\xe2\x80\x99s feet.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get a hard rap on the knuckles\r\nover this affair.  We must be in a position to\xe2\x80\x94What is your general idea,\r\nstated shortly?  No need to go into details.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir Ethelred.  In principle, I should lay it down that the existence\r\nof secret agents should not be tolerated, as tending to augment the\r\npositive dangers of the evil against which they are used.  That the spy\r\nwill fabricate his information is a mere commonplace.  But in the sphere\r\nof political and revolutionary action, relying partly on violence, the\r\nprofessional spy has every facility to fabricate the very facts\r\nthemselves, and will spread the double evil of emulation in one\r\ndirection, and of panic, hasty legislation, unreflecting hate, on the\r\nother.  However, this is an imperfect world\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe deep-voiced Presence on the hearthrug, motionless, with big elbows\r\nstuck out, said hastily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe lucid, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Ethelred\xe2\x80\x94An imperfect world.  Therefore directly the character\r\nof this affair suggested itself to me, I thought it should be dealt with\r\nwith special secrecy, and ventured to come over here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d approved the great Personage, glancing down complacently\r\nover his double chin.  \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody over at your shop who\r\nthinks that the Secretary of State may be trusted now and then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner had an amused smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was really thinking that it might be better at this stage for Heat to\r\nbe replaced by\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!  Heat?  An ass\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the great man, with distinct\r\nanimosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.  Pray, Sir Ethelred, don\xe2\x80\x99t put that unjust interpretation on\r\nmy remarks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what?  Too clever by half?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither\xe2\x80\x94at least not as a rule.  All the grounds of my surmises I have\r\nfrom him.  The only thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered by myself is that he has been\r\nmaking use of that man privately.  Who could blame him?  He\xe2\x80\x99s an old\r\npolice hand.  He told me virtually that he must have tools to work with.\r\nIt occurred to me that this tool should be surrendered to the Special\r\nCrimes division as a whole, instead of remaining the private property of\r\nChief Inspector Heat.  I extend my conception of our departmental duties\r\nto the suppression of the secret agent.  But Chief Inspector Heat is an\r\nold departmental hand.  He would accuse me of perverting its morality and\r\nattacking its efficiency.  He would define it bitterly as protection\r\nextended to the criminal class of revolutionists.  It would mean just\r\nthat to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  But what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say, first, that there\xe2\x80\x99s but poor comfort in being able to\r\ndeclare that any given act of violence\xe2\x80\x94damaging property or destroying\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94is not the work of anarchism at all, but of something else\r\naltogether\xe2\x80\x94some species of authorised scoundrelism.  This, I fancy, is\r\nmuch more frequent than we suppose.  Next, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that the\r\nexistence of these people in the pay of foreign governments destroys in a\r\nmeasure the efficiency of our supervision.  A spy of that sort can afford\r\nto be more reckless than the most reckless of conspirators.  His\r\noccupation is free from all restraint.  He\xe2\x80\x99s without as much faith as is\r\nnecessary for complete negation, and without that much law as is implied\r\nin lawlessness.  Thirdly, the existence of these spies amongst the\r\nrevolutionary groups, which we are reproached for harbouring here, does\r\naway with all certitude.  You have received a reassuring statement from\r\nChief Inspector Heat some time ago.  It was by no means groundless\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyet this episode happens.  I call it an episode, because this affair, I\r\nmake bold to say, is episodic; it is no part of any general scheme,\r\nhowever wild.  The very peculiarities which surprise and perplex Chief\r\nInspector Heat establish its character in my eyes.  I am keeping clear of\r\ndetails, Sir Ethelred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Personage on the hearthrug had been listening with profound\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so.  Be as concise as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner intimated by an earnest deferential gesture\r\nthat he was anxious to be concise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a peculiar stupidity and feebleness in the conduct of this\r\naffair which gives me excellent hopes of getting behind it and finding\r\nthere something else than an individual freak of fanaticism.  For it is a\r\nplanned thing, undoubtedly.  The actual perpetrator seems to have been\r\nled by the hand to the spot, and then abandoned hurriedly to his own\r\ndevices.  The inference is that he was imported from abroad for the\r\npurpose of committing this outrage.  At the same time one is forced to\r\nthe conclusion that he did not know enough English to ask his way, unless\r\none were to accept the fantastic theory that he was a deaf mute.  I\r\nwonder now\xe2\x80\x94But this is idle.  He has destroyed himself by an accident,\r\nobviously.  Not an extraordinary accident.  But an extraordinary little\r\nfact remains: the address on his clothing discovered by the merest\r\naccident, too.  It is an incredible little fact, so incredible that the\r\nexplanation which will account for it is bound to touch the bottom of\r\nthis affair.  Instead of instructing Heat to go on with this case, my\r\nintention is to seek this explanation personally\xe2\x80\x94by myself, I mean\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nit may be picked up.  That is in a certain shop in Brett Street, and on\r\nthe lips of a certain secret agent once upon a time the confidential and\r\ntrusted spy of the late Baron Stott-Wartenheim, Ambassador of a Great\r\nPower to the Court of St James.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner paused, then added: \xe2\x80\x9cThose fellows are a\r\nperfect pest.\xe2\x80\x9d  In order to raise his drooping glance to the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, the Personage on the hearthrug had gradually tilted his head\r\nfarther back, which gave him an aspect of extraordinary haughtiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not leave it to Heat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he is an old departmental hand.  They have their own morality.\r\nMy line of inquiry would appear to him an awful perversion of duty.  For\r\nhim the plain duty is to fasten the guilt upon as many prominent\r\nanarchists as he can on some slight indications he had picked up in the\r\ncourse of his investigation on the spot; whereas I, he would say, am bent\r\nupon vindicating their innocence.  I am trying to be as lucid as I can in\r\npresenting this obscure matter to you without details.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would, would he?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the proud head of Sir Ethelred from its\r\nlofty elevation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid so\xe2\x80\x94with an indignation and disgust of which you or I can\r\nhave no idea.  He\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent servant.  We must not put an undue\r\nstrain on his loyalty.  That\xe2\x80\x99s always a mistake.  Besides, I want a free\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94a freer hand than it would be perhaps advisable to give Chief\r\nInspector Heat.  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the slightest wish to spare this man Verloc.\r\nHe will, I imagine, be extremely startled to find his connection with\r\nthis affair, whatever it may be, brought home to him so quickly.\r\nFrightening him will not be very difficult.  But our true objective lies\r\nbehind him somewhere.  I want your authority to give him such assurances\r\nof personal safety as I may think proper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Personage on the hearthrug.  \xe2\x80\x9cFind out as much as\r\nyou can; find it out in your own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must set about it without loss of time, this very evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nAssistant Commissioner.\r\n\r\nSir Ethelred shifted one hand under his coat tails, and tilting back his\r\nhead, looked at him steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a late sitting to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome to the House with\r\nyour discoveries if we are not gone home.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll warn Toodles to look out\r\nfor you.  He\xe2\x80\x99ll take you into my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe numerous family and the wide connections of the youthful-looking\r\nPrivate Secretary cherished for him the hope of an austere and exalted\r\ndestiny.  Meantime the social sphere he adorned in his hours of idleness\r\nchose to pet him under the above nickname.  And Sir Ethelred, hearing it\r\non the lips of his wife and girls every day (mostly at breakfast-time),\r\nhad conferred upon it the dignity of unsmiling adoption.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner was surprised and gratified extremely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall certainly bring my discoveries to the House on the chance of you\r\nhaving the time to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have the time,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the great Personage.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will\r\nsee you.  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the time now\xe2\x80\x94And you are going yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Ethelred.  I think it the best way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Personage had tilted his head so far back that, in order to keep the\r\nAssistant Commissioner under his observation, he had to nearly close his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m.  Ha!  And how do you propose\xe2\x80\x94Will you assume a disguise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly a disguise!  I\xe2\x80\x99ll change my clothes, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the great man, with a sort of absent-minded\r\nloftiness.  He turned his big head slowly, and over his shoulder gave a\r\nhaughty oblique stare to the ponderous marble timepiece with the sly,\r\nfeeble tick.  The gilt hands had taken the opportunity to steal through\r\nno less than five and twenty minutes behind his back.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner, who could not see them, grew a little nervous\r\nin the interval.  But the great man presented to him a calm and\r\nundismayed face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and paused, as if in deliberate contempt of the\r\nofficial clock.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut what first put you in motion in this direction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been always of opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d began the Assistant Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh.  Yes!  Opinion.  That\xe2\x80\x99s of course.  But the immediate motive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say, Sir Ethelred?  A new man\xe2\x80\x99s antagonism to old methods.\r\nA desire to know something at first hand.  Some impatience.  It\xe2\x80\x99s my old\r\nwork, but the harness is different.  It has been chafing me a little in\r\none or two tender places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll get on over there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the great man kindly, extending\r\nhis hand, soft to the touch, but broad and powerful like the hand of a\r\nglorified farmer.  The Assistant Commissioner shook it, and withdrew.\r\n\r\nIn the outer room Toodles, who had been waiting perched on the edge of a\r\ntable, advanced to meet him, subduing his natural buoyancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?  Satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with airy importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve earned my undying gratitude,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Assistant\r\nCommissioner, whose long face looked wooden in contrast with the peculiar\r\ncharacter of the other\xe2\x80\x99s gravity, which seemed perpetually ready to break\r\ninto ripples and chuckles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right.  But seriously, you can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how irritated he is\r\nby the attacks on his Bill for the Nationalisation of Fisheries.  They\r\ncall it the beginning of social revolution.  Of course, it is a\r\nrevolutionary measure.  But these fellows have no decency.  The personal\r\nattacks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read the papers,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Assistant Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdious?  Eh?  And you have no notion what a mass of work he has got to\r\nget through every day.  He does it all himself.  Seems unable to trust\r\nanyone with these Fisheries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet he\xe2\x80\x99s given a whole half hour to the consideration of my very\r\nsmall sprat,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected the Assistant Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmall!  Is it?  I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear that.  But it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity you didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\naway, then.  This fight takes it out of him frightfully.  The man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting exhausted.  I feel it by the way he leans on my arm as we walk\r\nover.  And, I say, is he safe in the streets?  Mullins has been marching\r\nhis men up here this afternoon.  There\xe2\x80\x99s a constable stuck by every\r\nlamp-post, and every second person we meet between this and Palace Yard\r\nis an obvious \xe2\x80\x98tec.\xe2\x80\x99  It will get on his nerves presently.  I say, these\r\nforeign scoundrels aren\xe2\x80\x99t likely to throw something at him\xe2\x80\x94are they?  It\r\nwould be a national calamity.  The country can\xe2\x80\x99t spare him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to mention yourself.  He leans on your arm,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the Assistant\r\nCommissioner soberly.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou would both go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be an easy way for a young man to go down into history?  Not so\r\nmany British Ministers have been assassinated as to make it a minor\r\nincident.  But seriously now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that if you want to go down into history you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do\r\nsomething for it.  Seriously, there\xe2\x80\x99s no danger whatever for both of you\r\nbut from overwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic Toodles welcomed this opening for a chuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisheries won\xe2\x80\x99t kill me.  I am used to late hours,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared,\r\nwith ingenuous levity.  But, feeling an instant compunction, he began to\r\nassume an air of statesman-like moodiness, as one draws on a glove.  \xe2\x80\x9cHis\r\nmassive intellect will stand any amount of work.  It\xe2\x80\x99s his nerves that I\r\nam afraid of.  The reactionary gang, with that abusive brute Cheeseman at\r\ntheir head, insult him every night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he will insist on beginning a revolution!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Assistant\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come, and he is the only man great enough for the work,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nprotested the revolutionary Toodles, flaring up under the calm,\r\nspeculative gaze of the Assistant Commissioner.  Somewhere in a corridor\r\na distant bell tinkled urgently, and with devoted vigilance the young man\r\npricked up his ears at the sound.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s ready to go now,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed\r\nin a whisper, snatched up his hat, and vanished from the room.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner went out by another door in a less elastic\r\nmanner.  Again he crossed the wide thoroughfare, walked along a narrow\r\nstreet, and re-entered hastily his own departmental buildings.  He kept\r\nup this accelerated pace to the door of his private room.  Before he had\r\nclosed it fairly his eyes sought his desk.  He stood still for a moment,\r\nthen walked up, looked all round on the floor, sat down in his chair,\r\nrang a bell, and waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChief Inspector Heat gone yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.  Went away half-an-hour ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat will do.\xe2\x80\x9d  And sitting still, with his hat pushed off\r\nhis forehead, he thought that it was just like Heat\xe2\x80\x99s confounded cheek to\r\ncarry off quietly the only piece of material evidence.  But he thought\r\nthis without animosity.  Old and valued servants will take liberties.\r\nThe piece of overcoat with the address sewn on was certainly not a thing\r\nto leave about.  Dismissing from his mind this manifestation of Chief\r\nInspector Heat\xe2\x80\x99s mistrust, he wrote and despatched a note to his wife,\r\ncharging her to make his apologies to Michaelis\xe2\x80\x99 great lady, with whom\r\nthey were engaged to dine that evening.\r\n\r\nThe short jacket and the low, round hat he assumed in a sort of curtained\r\nalcove containing a washstand, a row of wooden pegs and a shelf, brought\r\nout wonderfully the length of his grave, brown face.  He stepped back\r\ninto the full light of the room, looking like the vision of a cool,\r\nreflective Don Quixote, with the sunken eyes of a dark enthusiast and a\r\nvery deliberate manner.  He left the scene of his daily labours quickly\r\nlike an unobtrusive shadow.  His descent into the street was like the\r\ndescent into a slimy aquarium from which the water had been run off.  A\r\nmurky, gloomy dampness enveloped him.  The walls of the houses were wet,\r\nthe mud of the roadway glistened with an effect of phosphorescence, and\r\nwhen he emerged into the Strand out of a narrow street by the side of\r\nCharing Cross Station the genius of the locality assimilated him.  He\r\nmight have been but one more of the queer foreign fish that can be seen\r\nof an evening about there flitting round the dark corners.\r\n\r\nHe came to a stand on the very edge of the pavement, and waited.  His\r\nexercised eyes had made out in the confused movements of lights and\r\nshadows thronging the roadway the crawling approach of a hansom.  He gave\r\nno sign; but when the low step gliding along the curbstone came to his\r\nfeet he dodged in skilfully in front of the big turning wheel, and spoke\r\nup through the little trap door almost before the man gazing supinely\r\nahead from his perch was aware of having been boarded by a fare.\r\n\r\nIt was not a long drive.  It ended by signal abruptly, nowhere in\r\nparticular, between two lamp-posts before a large drapery establishment\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlong range of shops already lapped up in sheets of corrugated iron for\r\nthe night.  Tendering a coin through the trap door the fare slipped out\r\nand away, leaving an effect of uncanny, eccentric ghastliness upon the\r\ndriver\xe2\x80\x99s mind.  But the size of the coin was satisfactory to his touch,\r\nand his education not being literary, he remained untroubled by the fear\r\nof finding it presently turned to a dead leaf in his pocket.  Raised\r\nabove the world of fares by the nature of his calling, he contemplated\r\ntheir actions with a limited interest.  The sharp pulling of his horse\r\nright round expressed his philosophy.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Assistant Commissioner was already giving his order to a\r\nwaiter in a little Italian restaurant round the corner\xe2\x80\x94one of those traps\r\nfor the hungry, long and narrow, baited with a perspective of mirrors and\r\nwhite napery; without air, but with an atmosphere of their own\xe2\x80\x94an\r\natmosphere of fraudulent cookery mocking an abject mankind in the most\r\npressing of its miserable necessities.  In this immoral atmosphere the\r\nAssistant Commissioner, reflecting upon his enterprise, seemed to lose\r\nsome more of his identity.  He had a sense of loneliness, of evil\r\nfreedom.  It was rather pleasant.  When, after paying for his short meal,\r\nhe stood up and waited for his change, he saw himself in the sheet of\r\nglass, and was struck by his foreign appearance.  He contemplated his own\r\nimage with a melancholy and inquisitive gaze, then by sudden inspiration\r\nraised the collar of his jacket.  This arrangement appeared to him\r\ncommendable, and he completed it by giving an upward twist to the ends of\r\nhis black moustache.  He was satisfied by the subtle modification of his\r\npersonal aspect caused by these small changes.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do very well,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe thought.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get a little wet, a little splashed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe became aware of the waiter at his elbow and of a small pile of silver\r\ncoins on the edge of the table before him.  The waiter kept one eye on\r\nit, while his other eye followed the long back of a tall, not very young\r\ngirl, who passed up to a distant table looking perfectly sightless and\r\naltogether unapproachable.  She seemed to be a habitual customer.\r\n\r\nOn going out the Assistant Commissioner made to himself the observation\r\nthat the patrons of the place had lost in the frequentation of fraudulent\r\ncookery all their national and private characteristics.  And this was\r\nstrange, since the Italian restaurant is such a peculiarly British\r\ninstitution.  But these people were as denationalised as the dishes set\r\nbefore them with every circumstance of unstamped respectability.  Neither\r\nwas their personality stamped in any way, professionally, socially or\r\nracially.  They seemed created for the Italian restaurant, unless the\r\nItalian restaurant had been perchance created for them.  But that last\r\nhypothesis was unthinkable, since one could not place them anywhere\r\noutside those special establishments.  One never met these enigmatical\r\npersons elsewhere.  It was impossible to form a precise idea what\r\noccupations they followed by day and where they went to bed at night.\r\nAnd he himself had become unplaced.  It would have been impossible for\r\nanybody to guess his occupation.  As to going to bed, there was a doubt\r\neven in his own mind.  Not indeed in regard to his domicile itself, but\r\nvery much so in respect of the time when he would be able to return\r\nthere.  A pleasurable feeling of independence possessed him when he heard\r\nthe glass doors swing to behind his back with a sort of imperfect baffled\r\nthud.  He advanced at once into an immensity of greasy slime and damp\r\nplaster interspersed with lamps, and enveloped, oppressed, penetrated,\r\nchoked, and suffocated by the blackness of a wet London night, which is\r\ncomposed of soot and drops of water.\r\n\r\nBrett Street was not very far away.  It branched off, narrow, from the\r\nside of an open triangular space surrounded by dark and mysterious\r\nhouses, temples of petty commerce emptied of traders for the night.  Only\r\na fruiterer\xe2\x80\x99s stall at the corner made a violent blaze of light and\r\ncolour.  Beyond all was black, and the few people passing in that\r\ndirection vanished at one stride beyond the glowing heaps of oranges and\r\nlemons.  No footsteps echoed.  They would never be heard of again.  The\r\nadventurous head of the Special Crimes Department watched these\r\ndisappearances from a distance with an interested eye.  He felt\r\nlight-hearted, as though he had been ambushed all alone in a jungle many\r\nthousands of miles away from departmental desks and official inkstands.\r\nThis joyousness and dispersion of thought before a task of some\r\nimportance seems to prove that this world of ours is not such a very\r\nserious affair after all.  For the Assistant Commissioner was not\r\nconstitutionally inclined to levity.\r\n\r\nThe policeman on the beat projected his sombre and moving form against\r\nthe luminous glory of oranges and lemons, and entered Brett Street\r\nwithout haste.  The Assistant Commissioner, as though he were a member of\r\nthe criminal classes, lingered out of sight, awaiting his return.  But\r\nthis constable seemed to be lost for ever to the force.  He never\r\nreturned: must have gone out at the other end of Brett Street.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner, reaching this conclusion, entered the street\r\nin his turn, and came upon a large van arrested in front of the dimly lit\r\nwindow-panes of a carter\xe2\x80\x99s eating-house.  The man was refreshing himself\r\ninside, and the horses, their big heads lowered to the ground, fed out of\r\nnose-bags steadily.  Farther on, on the opposite side of the street,\r\nanother suspect patch of dim light issued from Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s shop front,\r\nhung with papers, heaving with vague piles of cardboard boxes and the\r\nshapes of books.  The Assistant Commissioner stood observing it across\r\nthe roadway.  There could be no mistake.  By the side of the front\r\nwindow, encumbered by the shadows of nondescript things, the door,\r\nstanding ajar, let escape on the pavement a narrow, clear streak of\r\ngas-light within.\r\n\r\nBehind the Assistant Commissioner the van and horses, merged into one\r\nmass, seemed something alive\xe2\x80\x94a square-backed black monster blocking half\r\nthe street, with sudden iron-shod stampings, fierce jingles, and heavy,\r\nblowing sighs.  The harshly festive, ill-omened glare of a large and\r\nprosperous public-house faced the other end of Brett Street across a wide\r\nroad.  This barrier of blazing lights, opposing the shadows gathered\r\nabout the humble abode of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s domestic happiness, seemed to drive\r\nthe obscurity of the street back upon itself, make it more sullen,\r\nbrooding, and sinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving infused by persistent importunities some sort of heat into the\r\nchilly interest of several licensed victuallers (the acquaintances once\r\nupon a time of her late unlucky husband), Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother had at last\r\nsecured her admission to certain almshouses founded by a wealthy\r\ninnkeeper for the destitute widows of the trade.\r\n\r\nThis end, conceived in the astuteness of her uneasy heart, the old woman\r\nhad pursued with secrecy and determination.  That was the time when her\r\ndaughter Winnie could not help passing a remark to Mr Verloc that \xe2\x80\x9cmother\r\nhas been spending half-crowns and five shillings almost every day this\r\nlast week in cab fares.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the remark was not made grudgingly.  Winnie\r\nrespected her mother\xe2\x80\x99s infirmities.  She was only a little surprised at\r\nthis sudden mania for locomotion.  Mr Verloc, who was sufficiently\r\nmagnificent in his way, had grunted the remark impatiently aside as\r\ninterfering with his meditations.  These were frequent, deep, and\r\nprolonged; they bore upon a matter more important than five shillings.\r\nDistinctly more important, and beyond all comparison more difficult to\r\nconsider in all its aspects with philosophical serenity.\r\n\r\nHer object attained in astute secrecy, the heroic old woman had made a\r\nclean breast of it to Mrs Verloc.  Her soul was triumphant and her heart\r\ntremulous.  Inwardly she quaked, because she dreaded and admired the\r\ncalm, self-contained character of her daughter Winnie, whose displeasure\r\nwas made redoubtable by a diversity of dreadful silences.  But she did\r\nnot allow her inward apprehensions to rob her of the advantage of\r\nvenerable placidity conferred upon her outward person by her triple chin,\r\nthe floating ampleness of her ancient form, and the impotent condition of\r\nher legs.\r\n\r\nThe shock of the information was so unexpected that Mrs Verloc, against\r\nher usual practice when addressed, interrupted the domestic occupation\r\nshe was engaged upon.  It was the dusting of the furniture in the parlour\r\nbehind the shop.  She turned her head towards her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever did you want to do that for?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, in scandalised\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nThe shock must have been severe to make her depart from that distant and\r\nuninquiring acceptance of facts which was her force and her safeguard in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you made comfortable enough here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had lapsed into these inquiries, but next moment she saved the\r\nconsistency of her conduct by resuming her dusting, while the old woman\r\nsat scared and dumb under her dingy white cap and lustreless dark wig.\r\n\r\nWinnie finished the chair, and ran the duster along the mahogany at the\r\nback of the horse-hair sofa on which Mr Verloc loved to take his ease in\r\nhat and overcoat.  She was intent on her work, but presently she\r\npermitted herself another question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow in the world did you manage it, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs not affecting the inwardness of things, which it was Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprinciple to ignore, this curiosity was excusable.  It bore merely on the\r\nmethods.  The old woman welcomed it eagerly as bringing forward something\r\nthat could be talked about with much sincerity.\r\n\r\nShe favoured her daughter by an exhaustive answer, full of names and\r\nenriched by side comments upon the ravages of time as observed in the\r\nalteration of human countenances.  The names were principally the names\r\nof licensed victuallers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpoor daddy\xe2\x80\x99s friends, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d  She enlarged\r\nwith special appreciation on the kindness and condescension of a large\r\nbrewer, a Baronet and an M. P., the Chairman of the Governors of the\r\nCharity.  She expressed herself thus warmly because she had been allowed\r\nto interview by appointment his Private Secretary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca very polite\r\ngentleman, all in black, with a gentle, sad voice, but so very, very thin\r\nand quiet.  He was like a shadow, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinnie, prolonging her dusting operations till the tale was told to the\r\nend, walked out of the parlour into the kitchen (down two steps) in her\r\nusual manner, without the slightest comment.\r\n\r\nShedding a few tears in sign of rejoicing at her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s mansuetude in\r\nthis terrible affair, Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother gave play to her astuteness in\r\nthe direction of her furniture, because it was her own; and sometimes she\r\nwished it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been.  Heroism is all very well, but there are\r\ncircumstances when the disposal of a few tables and chairs, brass\r\nbedsteads, and so on, may be big with remote and disastrous consequences.\r\nShe required a few pieces herself, the Foundation which, after many\r\nimportunities, had gathered her to its charitable breast, giving nothing\r\nbut bare planks and cheaply papered bricks to the objects of its\r\nsolicitude.  The delicacy guiding her choice to the least valuable and\r\nmost dilapidated articles passed unacknowledged, because Winnie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphilosophy consisted in not taking notice of the inside of facts; she\r\nassumed that mother took what suited her best.  As to Mr Verloc, his\r\nintense meditation, like a sort of Chinese wall, isolated him completely\r\nfrom the phenomena of this world of vain effort and illusory appearances.\r\n\r\nHer selection made, the disposal of the rest became a perplexing question\r\nin a particular way.  She was leaving it in Brett Street, of course.  But\r\nshe had two children.  Winnie was provided for by her sensible union with\r\nthat excellent husband, Mr Verloc.  Stevie was destitute\xe2\x80\x94and a little\r\npeculiar.  His position had to be considered before the claims of legal\r\njustice and even the promptings of partiality.  The possession of the\r\nfurniture would not be in any sense a provision.  He ought to have it\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npoor boy.  But to give it to him would be like tampering with his\r\nposition of complete dependence.  It was a sort of claim which she feared\r\nto weaken.  Moreover, the susceptibilities of Mr Verloc would perhaps not\r\nbrook being beholden to his brother-in-law for the chairs he sat on.  In\r\na long experience of gentlemen lodgers, Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother had acquired\r\na dismal but resigned notion of the fantastic side of human nature.  What\r\nif Mr Verloc suddenly took it into his head to tell Stevie to take his\r\nblessed sticks somewhere out of that?  A division, on the other hand,\r\nhowever carefully made, might give some cause of offence to Winnie.  No,\r\nStevie must remain destitute and dependent.  And at the moment of leaving\r\nBrett Street she had said to her daughter: \xe2\x80\x9cNo use waiting till I am\r\ndead, is there?  Everything I leave here is altogether your own now, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinnie, with her hat on, silent behind her mother\xe2\x80\x99s back, went on\r\narranging the collar of the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s cloak.  She got her hand-bag, an\r\numbrella, with an impassive face.  The time had come for the expenditure\r\nof the sum of three-and-sixpence on what might well be supposed the last\r\ncab drive of Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s life.  They went out at the shop door.\r\n\r\nThe conveyance awaiting them would have illustrated the proverb that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctruth can be more cruel than caricature,\xe2\x80\x9d if such a proverb existed.\r\nCrawling behind an infirm horse, a metropolitan hackney carriage drew up\r\non wobbly wheels and with a maimed driver on the box.  This last\r\npeculiarity caused some embarrassment.  Catching sight of a hooked iron\r\ncontrivance protruding from the left sleeve of the man\xe2\x80\x99s coat, Mrs\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother lost suddenly the heroic courage of these days.  She\r\nreally couldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust herself.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, Winnie?\xe2\x80\x9d  She hung\r\nback.  The passionate expostulations of the big-faced cabman seemed to be\r\nsqueezed out of a blocked throat.  Leaning over from his box, he\r\nwhispered with mysterious indignation.  What was the matter now?  Was it\r\npossible to treat a man so?  His enormous and unwashed countenance flamed\r\nred in the muddy stretch of the street.  Was it likely they would have\r\ngiven him a licence, he inquired desperately, if\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe police constable of the locality quieted him by a friendly glance;\r\nthen addressing himself to the two women without marked consideration,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been driving a cab for twenty years.  I never knew him to have an\r\naccident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccident!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the driver in a scornful whisper.\r\n\r\nThe policeman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony settled it.  The modest assemblage of seven\r\npeople, mostly under age, dispersed.  Winnie followed her mother into the\r\ncab.  Stevie climbed on the box.  His vacant mouth and distressed eyes\r\ndepicted the state of his mind in regard to the transactions which were\r\ntaking place.  In the narrow streets the progress of the journey was made\r\nsensible to those within by the near fronts of the houses gliding past\r\nslowly and shakily, with a great rattle and jingling of glass, as if\r\nabout to collapse behind the cab; and the infirm horse, with the harness\r\nhung over his sharp backbone flapping very loose about his thighs,\r\nappeared to be dancing mincingly on his toes with infinite patience.\r\nLater on, in the wider space of Whitehall, all visual evidences of motion\r\nbecame imperceptible.  The rattle and jingle of glass went on\r\nindefinitely in front of the long Treasury building\xe2\x80\x94and time itself\r\nseemed to stand still.\r\n\r\nAt last Winnie observed: \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t a very good horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes gleamed in the shadow of the cab straight ahead, immovable.  On\r\nthe box, Stevie shut his vacant mouth first, in order to ejaculate\r\nearnestly: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe driver, holding high the reins twisted around the hook, took no\r\nnotice.  Perhaps he had not heard.  Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s breast heaved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t whip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man turned slowly his bloated and sodden face of many colours\r\nbristling with white hairs.  His little red eyes glistened with moisture.\r\nHis big lips had a violet tint.  They remained closed.  With the dirty\r\nback of his whip-hand he rubbed the stubble sprouting on his enormous\r\nchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered out Stevie violently.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMustn\xe2\x80\x99t whip,\xe2\x80\x9d queried the other in a thoughtful whisper, and\r\nimmediately whipped.  He did this, not because his soul was cruel and his\r\nheart evil, but because he had to earn his fare.  And for a time the\r\nwalls of St Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s, with its towers and pinnacles, contemplated in\r\nimmobility and silence a cab that jingled.  It rolled too, however.  But\r\non the bridge there was a commotion.  Stevie suddenly proceeded to get\r\ndown from the box.  There were shouts on the pavement, people ran\r\nforward, the driver pulled up, whispering curses of indignation and\r\nastonishment.  Winnie lowered the window, and put her head out, white as\r\na ghost.  In the depths of the cab, her mother was exclaiming, in tones\r\nof anguish: \xe2\x80\x9cIs that boy hurt?  Is that boy hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStevie was not hurt, he had not even fallen, but excitement as usual had\r\nrobbed him of the power of connected speech.  He could do no more than\r\nstammer at the window.  \xe2\x80\x9cToo heavy.  Too heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Winnie put out her hand\r\non to his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStevie!  Get up on the box directly, and don\xe2\x80\x99t try to get down again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  No.  Walk.  Must walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn trying to state the nature of that necessity he stammered himself into\r\nutter incoherence.  No physical impossibility stood in the way of his\r\nwhim.  Stevie could have managed easily to keep pace with the infirm,\r\ndancing horse without getting out of breath.  But his sister withheld her\r\nconsent decisively.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea!  Whoever heard of such a thing!  Run\r\nafter a cab!\xe2\x80\x9d  Her mother, frightened and helpless in the depths of the\r\nconveyance, entreated: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let him, Winnie.  He\xe2\x80\x99ll get lost.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.  What next!  Mr Verloc will be sorry to hear of this\r\nnonsense, Stevie,\xe2\x80\x94I can tell you.  He won\xe2\x80\x99t be happy at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s grief and unhappiness acting as usual powerfully\r\nupon Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s fundamentally docile disposition, he abandoned all\r\nresistance, and climbed up again on the box, with a face of despair.\r\n\r\nThe cabby turned at him his enormous and inflamed countenance\r\ntruculently.  \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you go for trying this silly game again, young\r\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter delivering himself thus in a stern whisper, strained almost to\r\nextinction, he drove on, ruminating solemnly.  To his mind the incident\r\nremained somewhat obscure.  But his intellect, though it had lost its\r\npristine vivacity in the benumbing years of sedentary exposure to the\r\nweather, lacked not independence or sanity.  Gravely he dismissed the\r\nhypothesis of Stevie being a drunken young nipper.\r\n\r\nInside the cab the spell of silence, in which the two women had endured\r\nshoulder to shoulder the jolting, rattling, and jingling of the journey,\r\nhad been broken by Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak.  Winnie raised her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done what you wanted, mother.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll have only yourself to thank\r\nfor it if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t happy afterwards.  And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be.\r\nThat I don\xe2\x80\x99t.  Weren\xe2\x80\x99t you comfortable enough in the house?  Whatever\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99ll think of us\xe2\x80\x94you throwing yourself like this on a Charity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the old woman earnestly above the noise, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nthe best of daughters to me.  As to Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWords failing her on the subject of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s excellence, she turned\r\nher old tearful eyes to the roof of the cab.  Then she averted her head\r\non the pretence of looking out of the window, as if to judge of their\r\nprogress.  It was insignificant, and went on close to the curbstone.\r\nNight, the early dirty night, the sinister, noisy, hopeless and rowdy\r\nnight of South London, had overtaken her on her last cab drive.  In the\r\ngas-light of the low-fronted shops her big cheeks glowed with an orange\r\nhue under a black and mauve bonnet.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s complexion had become yellow by the effect of age\r\nand from a natural predisposition to biliousness, favoured by the trials\r\nof a difficult and worried existence, first as wife, then as widow.  It\r\nwas a complexion, that under the influence of a blush would take on an\r\norange tint.  And this woman, modest indeed but hardened in the fires of\r\nadversity, of an age, moreover, when blushes are not expected, had\r\npositively blushed before her daughter.  In the privacy of a\r\nfour-wheeler, on her way to a charity cottage (one of a row) which by the\r\nexiguity of its dimensions and the simplicity of its accommodation, might\r\nwell have been devised in kindness as a place of training for the still\r\nmore straitened circumstances of the grave, she was forced to hide from\r\nher own child a blush of remorse and shame.\r\n\r\nWhatever people will think?  She knew very well what they did think, the\r\npeople Winnie had in her mind\xe2\x80\x94the old friends of her husband, and others\r\ntoo, whose interest she had solicited with such flattering success.  She\r\nhad not known before what a good beggar she could be.  But she guessed\r\nvery well what inference was drawn from her application.  On account of\r\nthat shrinking delicacy, which exists side by side with aggressive\r\nbrutality in masculine nature, the inquiries into her circumstances had\r\nnot been pushed very far.  She had checked them by a visible compression\r\nof the lips and some display of an emotion determined to be eloquently\r\nsilent.  And the men would become suddenly incurious, after the manner of\r\ntheir kind.  She congratulated herself more than once on having nothing\r\nto do with women, who being naturally more callous and avid of details,\r\nwould have been anxious to be exactly informed by what sort of unkind\r\nconduct her daughter and son-in-law had driven her to that sad extremity.\r\nIt was only before the Secretary of the great brewer M. P. and Chairman\r\nof the Charity, who, acting for his principal, felt bound to be\r\nconscientiously inquisitive as to the real circumstances of the\r\napplicant, that she had burst into tears outright and aloud, as a\r\ncornered woman will weep.  The thin and polite gentleman, after\r\ncontemplating her with an air of being \xe2\x80\x9cstruck all of a heap,\xe2\x80\x9d abandoned\r\nhis position under the cover of soothing remarks.  She must not distress\r\nherself.  The deed of the Charity did not absolutely specify \xe2\x80\x9cchildless\r\nwidows.\xe2\x80\x9d  In fact, it did not by any means disqualify her.  But the\r\ndiscretion of the Committee must be an informed discretion.  One could\r\nunderstand very well her unwillingness to be a burden, etc. etc.\r\nThereupon, to his profound disappointment, Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother wept some\r\nmore with an augmented vehemence.\r\n\r\nThe tears of that large female in a dark, dusty wig, and ancient silk\r\ndress festooned with dingy white cotton lace, were the tears of genuine\r\ndistress.  She had wept because she was heroic and unscrupulous and full\r\nof love for both her children.  Girls frequently get sacrificed to the\r\nwelfare of the boys.  In this case she was sacrificing Winnie.  By the\r\nsuppression of truth she was slandering her.  Of course, Winnie was\r\nindependent, and need not care for the opinion of people that she would\r\nnever see and who would never see her; whereas poor Stevie had nothing in\r\nthe world he could call his own except his mother\xe2\x80\x99s heroism and\r\nunscrupulousness.\r\n\r\nThe first sense of security following on Winnie\xe2\x80\x99s marriage wore off in\r\ntime (for nothing lasts), and Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother, in the seclusion of\r\nthe back bedroom, had recalled the teaching of that experience which the\r\nworld impresses upon a widowed woman.  But she had recalled it without\r\nvain bitterness; her store of resignation amounted almost to dignity.\r\nShe reflected stoically that everything decays, wears out, in this world;\r\nthat the way of kindness should be made easy to the well disposed; that\r\nher daughter Winnie was a most devoted sister, and a very self-confident\r\nwife indeed.  As regards Winnie\xe2\x80\x99s sisterly devotion, her stoicism\r\nflinched.  She excepted that sentiment from the rule of decay affecting\r\nall things human and some things divine.  She could not help it; not to\r\ndo so would have frightened her too much.  But in considering the\r\nconditions of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s married state, she rejected firmly all\r\nflattering illusions.  She took the cold and reasonable view that the\r\nless strain put on Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s kindness the longer its effects were\r\nlikely to last.  That excellent man loved his wife, of course, but he\r\nwould, no doubt, prefer to keep as few of her relations as was consistent\r\nwith the proper display of that sentiment.  It would be better if its\r\nwhole effect were concentrated on poor Stevie.  And the heroic old woman\r\nresolved on going away from her children as an act of devotion and as a\r\nmove of deep policy.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cvirtue\xe2\x80\x9d of this policy consisted in this (Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother was\r\nsubtle in her way), that Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s moral claim would be strengthened.  The\r\npoor boy\xe2\x80\x94a good, useful boy, if a little peculiar\xe2\x80\x94had not a sufficient\r\nstanding.  He had been taken over with his mother, somewhat in the same\r\nway as the furniture of the Belgravian mansion had been taken over, as if\r\non the ground of belonging to her exclusively.  What will happen, she\r\nasked herself (for Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother was in a measure imaginative),\r\nwhen I die?  And when she asked herself that question it was with dread.\r\nIt was also terrible to think that she would not then have the means of\r\nknowing what happened to the poor boy.  But by making him over to his\r\nsister, by going thus away, she gave him the advantage of a directly\r\ndependent position.  This was the more subtle sanction of Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s heroism and unscrupulousness.  Her act of abandonment was really\r\nan arrangement for settling her son permanently in life.  Other people\r\nmade material sacrifices for such an object, she in that way.  It was the\r\nonly way.  Moreover, she would be able to see how it worked.  Ill or well\r\nshe would avoid the horrible incertitude on the death-bed.  But it was\r\nhard, hard, cruelly hard.\r\n\r\nThe cab rattled, jingled, jolted; in fact, the last was quite\r\nextraordinary.  By its disproportionate violence and magnitude it\r\nobliterated every sensation of onward movement; and the effect was of\r\nbeing shaken in a stationary apparatus like a medi\xc3\xa6val device for the\r\npunishment of crime, or some very newfangled invention for the cure of a\r\nsluggish liver.  It was extremely distressing; and the raising of Mrs\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice sounded like a wail of pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, my dear, you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to see me as often as you can spare the\r\ntime.  Won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Winnie shortly, staring straight before her.\r\n\r\nAnd the cab jolted in front of a steamy, greasy shop in a blaze of gas\r\nand in the smell of fried fish.\r\n\r\nThe old woman raised a wail again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, my dear, I must see that poor boy every Sunday.  He won\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nspending the day with his old mother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinnie screamed out stolidly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind!  I should think not.  That poor boy will miss you something cruel.\r\nI wish you had thought a little of that, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot think of it!  The heroic woman swallowed a playful and inconvenient\r\nobject like a billiard ball, which had tried to jump out of her throat.\r\nWinnie sat mute for a while, pouting at the front of the cab, then\r\nsnapped out, which was an unusual tone with her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a job with him at first, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be that restless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t let him worry your husband, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they discussed on familiar lines the bearings of a new situation.\r\nAnd the cab jolted.  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother expressed some misgivings.\r\nCould Stevie be trusted to come all that way alone?  Winnie maintained\r\nthat he was much less \xe2\x80\x9cabsent-minded\xe2\x80\x9d now.  They agreed as to that.  It\r\ncould not be denied.  Much less\xe2\x80\x94hardly at all.  They shouted at each\r\nother in the jingle with comparative cheerfulness.  But suddenly the\r\nmaternal anxiety broke out afresh.  There were two omnibuses to take, and\r\na short walk between.  It was too difficult!  The old woman gave way to\r\ngrief and consternation.\r\n\r\nWinnie stared forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you upset yourself like this, mother.  You must see him, of\r\ncourse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll try not to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe mopped her streaming eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t spare the time to come with him, and if he should forget\r\nhimself and lose his way and somebody spoke to him sharply, his name and\r\naddress may slip his memory, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll remain lost for days and days\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe vision of a workhouse infirmary for poor Stevie\xe2\x80\x94if only during\r\ninquiries\xe2\x80\x94wrung her heart.  For she was a proud woman.  Winnie\xe2\x80\x99s stare\r\nhad grown hard, intent, inventive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bring him to you myself every week,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nworry, mother.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll see to it that he don\xe2\x80\x99t get lost for long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey felt a peculiar bump; a vision of brick pillars lingered before the\r\nrattling windows of the cab; a sudden cessation of atrocious jolting and\r\nuproarious jingling dazed the two women.  What had happened?  They sat\r\nmotionless and scared in the profound stillness, till the door came open,\r\nand a rough, strained whispering was heard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA range of gabled little houses, each with one dim yellow window, on the\r\nground floor, surrounded the dark open space of a grass plot planted with\r\nshrubs and railed off from the patchwork of lights and shadows in the\r\nwide road, resounding with the dull rumble of traffic.  Before the door\r\nof one of these tiny houses\xe2\x80\x94one without a light in the little downstairs\r\nwindow\xe2\x80\x94the cab had come to a standstill.  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother got out\r\nfirst, backwards, with a key in her hand.  Winnie lingered on the\r\nflagstone path to pay the cabman.  Stevie, after helping to carry inside\r\na lot of small parcels, came out and stood under the light of a gas-lamp\r\nbelonging to the Charity.  The cabman looked at the pieces of silver,\r\nwhich, appearing very minute in his big, grimy palm, symbolised the\r\ninsignificant results which reward the ambitious courage and toil of a\r\nmankind whose day is short on this earth of evil.\r\n\r\nHe had been paid decently\xe2\x80\x94four one-shilling pieces\xe2\x80\x94and he contemplated\r\nthem in perfect stillness, as if they had been the surprising terms of a\r\nmelancholy problem.  The slow transfer of that treasure to an inner\r\npocket demanded much laborious groping in the depths of decayed clothing.\r\nHis form was squat and without flexibility.  Stevie, slender, his\r\nshoulders a little up, and his hands thrust deep in the side pockets of\r\nhis warm overcoat, stood at the edge of the path, pouting.\r\n\r\nThe cabman, pausing in his deliberate movements, seemed struck by some\r\nmisty recollection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!  \xe2\x80\x99Ere you are, young fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll know him\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStevie was staring at the horse, whose hind quarters appeared unduly\r\nelevated by the effect of emaciation.  The little stiff tail seemed to\r\nhave been fitted in for a heartless joke; and at the other end the thin,\r\nflat neck, like a plank covered with old horse-hide, drooped to the\r\nground under the weight of an enormous bony head.  The ears hung at\r\ndifferent angles, negligently; and the macabre figure of that mute\r\ndweller on the earth steamed straight up from ribs and backbone in the\r\nmuggy stillness of the air.\r\n\r\nThe cabman struck lightly Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s breast with the iron hook protruding\r\nfrom a ragged, greasy sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook \xe2\x80\x99ere, young feller.  \xe2\x80\x99Ow\xe2\x80\x99d _you_ like to sit behind this \xe2\x80\x99oss up to\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning p\xe2\x80\x99raps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStevie looked vacantly into the fierce little eyes with red-edged lids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t lame,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the other, whispering with energy.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot no sore places on \xe2\x80\x99im.  \xe2\x80\x99Ere he is.  \xe2\x80\x99Ow would _you_ like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis strained, extinct voice invested his utterance with a character of\r\nvehement secrecy.  Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s vacant gaze was changing slowly into dread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may well look!  Till three and four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.  Cold\r\nand \xe2\x80\x99ungry.  Looking for fares.  Drunks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis jovial purple cheeks bristled with white hairs; and like Virgil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSilenus, who, his face smeared with the juice of berries, discoursed of\r\nOlympian Gods to the innocent shepherds of Sicily, he talked to Stevie of\r\ndomestic matters and the affairs of men whose sufferings are great and\r\nimmortality by no means assured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a night cabby, I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, with a sort of boastful\r\nexasperation.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take out what they will blooming well give me\r\nat the yard.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my missus and four kids at \xe2\x80\x99ome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe monstrous nature of that declaration of paternity seemed to strike\r\nthe world dumb.  A silence reigned during which the flanks of the old\r\nhorse, the steed of apocalyptic misery, smoked upwards in the light of\r\nthe charitable gas-lamp.\r\n\r\nThe cabman grunted, then added in his mysterious whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis ain\xe2\x80\x99t an easy world.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s face had been twitching for some\r\ntime, and at last his feelings burst out in their usual concise form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad!  Bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis gaze remained fixed on the ribs of the horse, self-conscious and\r\nsombre, as though he were afraid to look about him at the badness of the\r\nworld.  And his slenderness, his rosy lips and pale, clear complexion,\r\ngave him the aspect of a delicate boy, notwithstanding the fluffy growth\r\nof golden hair on his cheeks.  He pouted in a scared way like a child.\r\nThe cabman, short and broad, eyed him with his fierce little eyes that\r\nseemed to smart in a clear and corroding liquid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Ard on \xe2\x80\x99osses, but dam\xe2\x80\x99 sight \xe2\x80\x99arder on poor chaps like me,\xe2\x80\x9d he wheezed\r\njust audibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor!  Poor!\xe2\x80\x9d stammered out Stevie, pushing his hands deeper into his\r\npockets with convulsive sympathy.  He could say nothing; for the\r\ntenderness to all pain and all misery, the desire to make the horse happy\r\nand the cabman happy, had reached the point of a bizarre longing to take\r\nthem to bed with him.  And that, he knew, was impossible.  For Stevie was\r\nnot mad.  It was, as it were, a symbolic longing; and at the same time it\r\nwas very distinct, because springing from experience, the mother of\r\nwisdom.  Thus when as a child he cowered in a dark corner scared,\r\nwretched, sore, and miserable with the black, black misery of the soul,\r\nhis sister Winnie used to come along, and carry him off to bed with her,\r\nas into a heaven of consoling peace.  Stevie, though apt to forget mere\r\nfacts, such as his name and address for instance, had a faithful memory\r\nof sensations.  To be taken into a bed of compassion was the supreme\r\nremedy, with the only one disadvantage of being difficult of application\r\non a large scale.  And looking at the cabman, Stevie perceived this\r\nclearly, because he was reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe cabman went on with his leisurely preparations as if Stevie had not\r\nexisted.  He made as if to hoist himself on the box, but at the last\r\nmoment from some obscure motive, perhaps merely from disgust with\r\ncarriage exercise, desisted.  He approached instead the motionless\r\npartner of his labours, and stooping to seize the bridle, lifted up the\r\nbig, weary head to the height of his shoulder with one effort of his\r\nright arm, like a feat of strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered secretly.\r\n\r\nLimping, he led the cab away.  There was an air of austerity in this\r\ndeparture, the scrunched gravel of the drive crying out under the slowly\r\nturning wheels, the horse\xe2\x80\x99s lean thighs moving with ascetic deliberation\r\naway from the light into the obscurity of the open space bordered dimly\r\nby the pointed roofs and the feebly shining windows of the little\r\nalms-houses.  The plaint of the gravel travelled slowly all round the\r\ndrive.  Between the lamps of the charitable gateway the slow cortege\r\nreappeared, lighted up for a moment, the short, thick man limping busily,\r\nwith the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head held aloft in his fist, the lank animal walking in\r\nstiff and forlorn dignity, the dark, low box on wheels rolling behind\r\ncomically with an air of waddling.  They turned to the left.  There was a\r\npub down the street, within fifty yards of the gate.\r\n\r\nStevie left alone beside the private lamp-post of the Charity, his hands\r\nthrust deep into his pockets, glared with vacant sulkiness.  At the\r\nbottom of his pockets his incapable weak hands were clinched hard into a\r\npair of angry fists.  In the face of anything which affected directly or\r\nindirectly his morbid dread of pain, Stevie ended by turning vicious.  A\r\nmagnanimous indignation swelled his frail chest to bursting, and caused\r\nhis candid eyes to squint.  Supremely wise in knowing his own\r\npowerlessness, Stevie was not wise enough to restrain his passions.  The\r\ntenderness of his universal charity had two phases as indissolubly joined\r\nand connected as the reverse and obverse sides of a medal.  The anguish\r\nof immoderate compassion was succeeded by the pain of an innocent but\r\npitiless rage.  Those two states expressing themselves outwardly by the\r\nsame signs of futile bodily agitation, his sister Winnie soothed his\r\nexcitement without ever fathoming its twofold character.  Mrs Verloc\r\nwasted no portion of this transient life in seeking for fundamental\r\ninformation.  This is a sort of economy having all the appearances and\r\nsome of the advantages of prudence.  Obviously it may be good for one not\r\nto know too much.  And such a view accords very well with constitutional\r\nindolence.\r\n\r\nOn that evening on which it may be said that Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mother having\r\nparted for good from her children had also departed this life, Winnie\r\nVerloc did not investigate her brother\xe2\x80\x99s psychology.  The poor boy was\r\nexcited, of course.  After once more assuring the old woman on the\r\nthreshold that she would know how to guard against the risk of Stevie\r\nlosing himself for very long on his pilgrimages of filial piety, she took\r\nher brother\xe2\x80\x99s arm to walk away.  Stevie did not even mutter to himself,\r\nbut with the special sense of sisterly devotion developed in her earliest\r\ninfancy, she felt that the boy was very much excited indeed.  Holding\r\ntight to his arm, under the appearance of leaning on it, she thought of\r\nsome words suitable to the occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Stevie, you must look well after me at the crossings, and get first\r\ninto the \xe2\x80\x99bus, like a good brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeal to manly protection was received by Stevie with his usual\r\ndocility.  It flattered him.  He raised his head and threw out his chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be nervous, Winnie.  Mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be nervous!  \xe2\x80\x99Bus all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered in a brusque, slurring stammer partaking of the timorousness of\r\na child and the resolution of a man.  He advanced fearlessly with the\r\nwoman on his arm, but his lower lip dropped.  Nevertheless, on the\r\npavement of the squalid and wide thoroughfare, whose poverty in all the\r\namenities of life stood foolishly exposed by a mad profusion of\r\ngas-lights, their resemblance to each other was so pronounced as to\r\nstrike the casual passers-by.\r\n\r\nBefore the doors of the public-house at the corner, where the profusion\r\nof gas-light reached the height of positive wickedness, a four-wheeled\r\ncab standing by the curbstone with no one on the box, seemed cast out\r\ninto the gutter on account of irremediable decay.  Mrs Verloc recognised\r\nthe conveyance.  Its aspect was so profoundly lamentable, with such a\r\nperfection of grotesque misery and weirdness of macabre detail, as if it\r\nwere the Cab of Death itself, that Mrs Verloc, with that ready compassion\r\nof a woman for a horse (when she is not sitting behind him), exclaimed\r\nvaguely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor brute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHanging back suddenly, Stevie inflicted an arresting jerk upon his\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor!  Poor!\xe2\x80\x9d he ejaculated appreciatively.  \xe2\x80\x9cCabman poor too.  He told\r\nme himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe contemplation of the infirm and lonely steed overcame him.  Jostled,\r\nbut obstinate, he would remain there, trying to express the view newly\r\nopened to his sympathies of the human and equine misery in close\r\nassociation.  But it was very difficult.  \xe2\x80\x9cPoor brute, poor people!\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nall he could repeat.  It did not seem forcible enough, and he came to a\r\nstop with an angry splutter: \xe2\x80\x9cShame!\xe2\x80\x9d  Stevie was no master of phrases,\r\nand perhaps for that very reason his thoughts lacked clearness and\r\nprecision.  But he felt with greater completeness and some profundity.\r\nThat little word contained all his sense of indignation and horror at one\r\nsort of wretchedness having to feed upon the anguish of the other\xe2\x80\x94at the\r\npoor cabman beating the poor horse in the name, as it were, of his poor\r\nkids at home.  And Stevie knew what it was to be beaten.  He knew it from\r\nexperience.  It was a bad world.  Bad!  Bad!\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, his only sister, guardian, and protector, could not pretend\r\nto such depths of insight.  Moreover, she had not experienced the magic\r\nof the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence.  She was in the dark as to the inwardness of\r\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9cShame.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she said placidly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, Stevie.  You can\xe2\x80\x99t help that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe docile Stevie went along; but now he went along without pride,\r\nshamblingly, and muttering half words, and even words that would have\r\nbeen whole if they had not been made up of halves that did not belong to\r\neach other.  It was as though he had been trying to fit all the words he\r\ncould remember to his sentiments in order to get some sort of\r\ncorresponding idea.  And, as a matter of fact, he got it at last.  He\r\nhung back to utter it at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad world for poor people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirectly he had expressed that thought he became aware that it was\r\nfamiliar to him already in all its consequences.  This circumstance\r\nstrengthened his conviction immensely, but also augmented his\r\nindignation.  Somebody, he felt, ought to be punished for it\xe2\x80\x94punished\r\nwith great severity.  Being no sceptic, but a moral creature, he was in a\r\nmanner at the mercy of his righteous passions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeastly!\xe2\x80\x9d he added concisely.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to Mrs Verloc that he was greatly excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody can help that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cDo come along.  Is that the way\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re taking care of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStevie mended his pace obediently.  He prided himself on being a good\r\nbrother.  His morality, which was very complete, demanded that from him.\r\nYet he was pained at the information imparted by his sister Winnie who\r\nwas good.  Nobody could help that!  He came along gloomily, but presently\r\nhe brightened up.  Like the rest of mankind, perplexed by the mystery of\r\nthe universe, he had his moments of consoling trust in the organised\r\npowers of the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolice,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested confidently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe police aren\xe2\x80\x99t for that,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs Verloc cursorily, hurrying on\r\nher way.\r\n\r\nStevie\xe2\x80\x99s face lengthened considerably.  He was thinking.  The more\r\nintense his thinking, the slacker was the droop of his lower jaw.\r\n\r\nAnd it was with an aspect of hopeless vacancy that he gave up his\r\nintellectual enterprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for that?\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled, resigned but surprised.  \xe2\x80\x9cNot for that?\xe2\x80\x9d  He\r\nhad formed for himself an ideal conception of the metropolitan police as\r\na sort of benevolent institution for the suppression of evil.  The notion\r\nof benevolence especially was very closely associated with his sense of\r\nthe power of the men in blue.  He had liked all police constables\r\ntenderly, with a guileless trustfulness.  And he was pained.  He was\r\nirritated, too, by a suspicion of duplicity in the members of the force.\r\nFor Stevie was frank and as open as the day himself.  What did they mean\r\nby pretending then?  Unlike his sister, who put her trust in face values,\r\nhe wished to go to the bottom of the matter.  He carried on his inquiry\r\nby means of an angry challenge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for are they then, Winn?  What are they for?  Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinnie disliked controversy.  But fearing most a fit of black depression\r\nconsequent on Stevie missing his mother very much at first, she did not\r\naltogether decline the discussion.  Guiltless of all irony, she answered\r\nyet in a form which was not perhaps unnatural in the wife of Mr Verloc,\r\nDelegate of the Central Red Committee, personal friend of certain\r\nanarchists, and a votary of social revolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know what the police are for, Stevie?  They are there so that\r\nthem as have nothing shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take anything away from them who have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe avoided using the verb \xe2\x80\x9cto steal,\xe2\x80\x9d because it always made her brother\r\nuncomfortable.  For Stevie was delicately honest.  Certain simple\r\nprinciples had been instilled into him so anxiously (on account of his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cqueerness\xe2\x80\x9d) that the mere names of certain transgressions filled him\r\nwith horror.  He had been always easily impressed by speeches.  He was\r\nimpressed and startled now, and his intelligence was very alert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at once anxiously.  \xe2\x80\x9cNot even if they were hungry?\r\nMustn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two had paused in their walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if they were ever so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Verloc, with the equanimity of a\r\nperson untroubled by the problem of the distribution of wealth, and\r\nexploring the perspective of the roadway for an omnibus of the right\r\ncolour.  \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.  But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking about all that?\r\nYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t ever hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe cast a swift glance at the boy, like a young man, by her side.  She\r\nsaw him amiable, attractive, affectionate, and only a little, a very\r\nlittle, peculiar.  And she could not see him otherwise, for he was\r\nconnected with what there was of the salt of passion in her tasteless\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94the passion of indignation, of courage, of pity, and even of\r\nself-sacrifice.  She did not add: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you aren\xe2\x80\x99t likely ever to be as\r\nlong as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d  But she might very well have done so, since she had\r\ntaken effectual steps to that end.  Mr Verloc was a very good husband.\r\nIt was her honest impression that nobody could help liking the boy.  She\r\ncried out suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Stevie.  Stop that green \xe2\x80\x99bus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Stevie, tremulous and important with his sister Winnie on his arm,\r\nflung up the other high above his head at the approaching \xe2\x80\x99bus, with\r\ncomplete success.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards Mr Verloc raised his eyes from a newspaper he was\r\nreading, or at any rate looking at, behind the counter, and in the\r\nexpiring clatter of the door-bell beheld Winnie, his wife, enter and\r\ncross the shop on her way upstairs, followed by Stevie, his\r\nbrother-in-law.  The sight of his wife was agreeable to Mr Verloc.  It\r\nwas his idiosyncrasy.  The figure of his brother-in-law remained\r\nimperceptible to him because of the morose thoughtfulness that lately had\r\nfallen like a veil between Mr Verloc and the appearances of the world of\r\nsenses.  He looked after his wife fixedly, without a word, as though she\r\nhad been a phantom.  His voice for home use was husky and placid, but now\r\nit was heard not at all.  It was not heard at supper, to which he was\r\ncalled by his wife in the usual brief manner: \xe2\x80\x9cAdolf.\xe2\x80\x9d  He sat down to\r\nconsume it without conviction, wearing his hat pushed far back on his\r\nhead.  It was not devotion to an outdoor life, but the frequentation of\r\nforeign caf\xc3\xa9s which was responsible for that habit, investing with a\r\ncharacter of unceremonious impermanency Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s steady fidelity to\r\nhis own fireside.  Twice at the clatter of the cracked bell he arose\r\nwithout a word, disappeared into the shop, and came back silently.\r\nDuring these absences Mrs Verloc, becoming acutely aware of the vacant\r\nplace at her right hand, missed her mother very much, and stared stonily;\r\nwhile Stevie, from the same reason, kept on shuffling his feet, as though\r\nthe floor under the table were uncomfortably hot.  When Mr Verloc\r\nreturned to sit in his place, like the very embodiment of silence, the\r\ncharacter of Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s stare underwent a subtle change, and Stevie\r\nceased to fidget with his feet, because of his great and awed regard for\r\nhis sister\xe2\x80\x99s husband.  He directed at him glances of respectful\r\ncompassion.  Mr Verloc was sorry.  His sister Winnie had impressed upon\r\nhim (in the omnibus) that Mr Verloc would be found at home in a state of\r\nsorrow, and must not be worried.  His father\xe2\x80\x99s anger, the irritability of\r\ngentlemen lodgers, and Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s predisposition to immoderate grief,\r\nhad been the main sanctions of Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s self-restraint.  Of these\r\nsentiments, all easily provoked, but not always easy to understand, the\r\nlast had the greatest moral efficiency\xe2\x80\x94because Mr Verloc was _good_.  His\r\nmother and his sister had established that ethical fact on an unshakable\r\nfoundation.  They had established, erected, consecrated it behind Mr\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s back, for reasons that had nothing to do with abstract morality.\r\nAnd Mr Verloc was not aware of it.  It is but bare justice to him to say\r\nthat he had no notion of appearing good to Stevie.  Yet so it was.  He\r\nwas even the only man so qualified in Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, because the\r\ngentlemen lodgers had been too transient and too remote to have anything\r\nvery distinct about them but perhaps their boots; and as regards the\r\ndisciplinary measures of his father, the desolation of his mother and\r\nsister shrank from setting up a theory of goodness before the victim.  It\r\nwould have been too cruel.  And it was even possible that Stevie would\r\nnot have believed them.  As far as Mr Verloc was concerned, nothing could\r\nstand in the way of Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s belief.  Mr Verloc was obviously yet\r\nmysteriously _good_.  And the grief of a good man is august.\r\n\r\nStevie gave glances of reverential compassion to his brother-in-law.  Mr\r\nVerloc was sorry.  The brother of Winnie had never before felt himself in\r\nsuch close communion with the mystery of that man\xe2\x80\x99s goodness.  It was an\r\nunderstandable sorrow.  And Stevie himself was sorry.  He was very sorry.\r\nThe same sort of sorrow.  And his attention being drawn to this\r\nunpleasant state, Stevie shuffled his feet.  His feelings were habitually\r\nmanifested by the agitation of his limbs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your feet quiet, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Verloc, with authority and\r\ntenderness; then turning towards her husband in an indifferent voice, the\r\nmasterly achievement of instinctive tact: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going out to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\nThe mere suggestion seemed repugnant to Mr Verloc.  He shook his head\r\nmoodily, and then sat still with downcast eyes, looking at the piece of\r\ncheese on his plate for a whole minute.  At the end of that time he got\r\nup, and went out\xe2\x80\x94went right out in the clatter of the shop-door bell.  He\r\nacted thus inconsistently, not from any desire to make himself\r\nunpleasant, but because of an unconquerable restlessness.  It was no\r\nearthly good going out.  He could not find anywhere in London what he\r\nwanted.  But he went out.  He led a cortege of dismal thoughts along dark\r\nstreets, through lighted streets, in and out of two flash bars, as if in\r\na half-hearted attempt to make a night of it, and finally back again to\r\nhis menaced home, where he sat down fatigued behind the counter, and they\r\ncrowded urgently round him, like a pack of hungry black hounds.  After\r\nlocking up the house and putting out the gas he took them upstairs with\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94a dreadful escort for a man going to bed.  His wife had preceded him\r\nsome time before, and with her ample form defined vaguely under the\r\ncounterpane, her head on the pillow, and a hand under the cheek offered\r\nto his distraction the view of early drowsiness arguing the possession of\r\nan equable soul.  Her big eyes stared wide open, inert and dark against\r\nthe snowy whiteness of the linen.  She did not move.\r\n\r\nShe had an equable soul.  She felt profoundly that things do not stand\r\nmuch looking into.  She made her force and her wisdom of that instinct.\r\nBut the taciturnity of Mr Verloc had been lying heavily upon her for a\r\ngood many days.  It was, as a matter of fact, affecting her nerves.\r\nRecumbent and motionless, she said placidly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll catch cold walking about in your socks like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech, becoming the solicitude of the wife and the prudence of the\r\nwoman, took Mr Verloc unawares.  He had left his boots downstairs, but he\r\nhad forgotten to put on his slippers, and he had been turning about the\r\nbedroom on noiseless pads like a bear in a cage.  At the sound of his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s voice he stopped and stared at her with a somnambulistic,\r\nexpressionless gaze so long that Mrs Verloc moved her limbs slightly\r\nunder the bed-clothes.  But she did not move her black head sunk in the\r\nwhite pillow one hand under her cheek and the big, dark, unwinking eyes.\r\n\r\nUnder her husband\xe2\x80\x99s expressionless stare, and remembering her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nempty room across the landing, she felt an acute pang of loneliness.  She\r\nhad never been parted from her mother before.  They had stood by each\r\nother.  She felt that they had, and she said to herself that now mother\r\nwas gone\xe2\x80\x94gone for good.  Mrs Verloc had no illusions.  Stevie remained,\r\nhowever.  And she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x99s done what she wanted to do.  There\xe2\x80\x99s no sense in it that I can\r\nsee.  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought you had enough of her.  It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfectly wicked, leaving us like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc was not a well-read person; his range of allusive phrases was\r\nlimited, but there was a peculiar aptness in circumstances which made him\r\nthink of rats leaving a doomed ship.  He very nearly said so.  He had\r\ngrown suspicious and embittered.  Could it be that the old woman had such\r\nan excellent nose?  But the unreasonableness of such a suspicion was\r\npatent, and Mr Verloc held his tongue.  Not altogether, however.  He\r\nmuttered heavily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s just as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to undress.  Mrs Verloc kept very still, perfectly still, with\r\nher eyes fixed in a dreamy, quiet stare.  And her heart for the fraction\r\nof a second seemed to stand still too.  That night she was \xe2\x80\x9cnot quite\r\nherself,\xe2\x80\x9d as the saying is, and it was borne upon her with some force\r\nthat a simple sentence may hold several diverse meanings\xe2\x80\x94mostly\r\ndisagreeable.  How was it just as well?  And why?  But she did not allow\r\nherself to fall into the idleness of barren speculation.  She was rather\r\nconfirmed in her belief that things did not stand being looked into.\r\nPractical and subtle in her way, she brought Stevie to the front without\r\nloss of time, because in her the singleness of purpose had the unerring\r\nnature and the force of an instinct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I am going to do to cheer up that boy for the first few days I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  He\xe2\x80\x99ll be worrying himself from morning till night\r\nbefore he gets used to mother being away.  And he\xe2\x80\x99s such a good boy.  I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do without him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc went on divesting himself of his clothing with the unnoticing\r\ninward concentration of a man undressing in the solitude of a vast and\r\nhopeless desert.  For thus inhospitably did this fair earth, our common\r\ninheritance, present itself to the mental vision of Mr Verloc.  All was\r\nso still without and within that the lonely ticking of the clock on the\r\nlanding stole into the room as if for the sake of company.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, getting into bed on his own side, remained prone and mute\r\nbehind Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s back.  His thick arms rested abandoned on the outside\r\nof the counterpane like dropped weapons, like discarded tools.  At that\r\nmoment he was within a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of making a clean breast of it all\r\nto his wife.  The moment seemed propitious.  Looking out of the corners\r\nof his eyes, he saw her ample shoulders draped in white, the back of her\r\nhead, with the hair done for the night in three plaits tied up with black\r\ntapes at the ends.  And he forbore.  Mr Verloc loved his wife as a wife\r\nshould be loved\xe2\x80\x94that is, maritally, with the regard one has for one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchief possession.  This head arranged for the night, those ample\r\nshoulders, had an aspect of familiar sacredness\xe2\x80\x94the sacredness of\r\ndomestic peace.  She moved not, massive and shapeless like a recumbent\r\nstatue in the rough; he remembered her wide-open eyes looking into the\r\nempty room.  She was mysterious, with the mysteriousness of living\r\nbeings.  The far-famed secret agent [delta] of the late Baron\r\nStott-Wartenheim\xe2\x80\x99s alarmist despatches was not the man to break into such\r\nmysteries.  He was easily intimidated.  And he was also indolent, with\r\nthe indolence which is so often the secret of good nature.  He forbore\r\ntouching that mystery out of love, timidity, and indolence.  There would\r\nbe always time enough.  For several minutes he bore his sufferings\r\nsilently in the drowsy silence of the room.  And then he disturbed it by\r\na resolute declaration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going on the Continent to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife might have fallen asleep already.  He could not tell.  As a\r\nmatter of fact, Mrs Verloc had heard him.  Her eyes remained very wide\r\nopen, and she lay very still, confirmed in her instinctive conviction\r\nthat things don\xe2\x80\x99t bear looking into very much.  And yet it was nothing\r\nvery unusual for Mr Verloc to take such a trip.  He renewed his stock\r\nfrom Paris and Brussels.  Often he went over to make his purchases\r\npersonally.  A little select connection of amateurs was forming around\r\nthe shop in Brett Street, a secret connection eminently proper for any\r\nbusiness undertaken by Mr Verloc, who, by a mystic accord of temperament\r\nand necessity, had been set apart to be a secret agent all his life.\r\n\r\nHe waited for a while, then added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be away a week or perhaps a\r\nfortnight.  Get Mrs Neale to come for the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Neale was the charwoman of Brett Street.  Victim of her marriage with\r\na debauched joiner, she was oppressed by the needs of many infant\r\nchildren.  Red-armed, and aproned in coarse sacking up to the arm-pits,\r\nshe exhaled the anguish of the poor in a breath of soap-suds and rum, in\r\nthe uproar of scrubbing, in the clatter of tin pails.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, full of deep purpose, spoke in the tone of the shallowest\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need to have the woman here all day.  I shall do very well\r\nwith Stevie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe let the lonely clock on the landing count off fifteen ticks into the\r\nabyss of eternity, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I put the light out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc snapped at his wife huskily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Verloc returning from the Continent at the end of ten days, brought\r\nback a mind evidently unrefreshed by the wonders of foreign travel and a\r\ncountenance unlighted by the joys of home-coming.  He entered in the\r\nclatter of the shop bell with an air of sombre and vexed exhaustion.  His\r\nbag in hand, his head lowered, he strode straight behind the counter, and\r\nlet himself fall into the chair, as though he had tramped all the way\r\nfrom Dover.  It was early morning.  Stevie, dusting various objects\r\ndisplayed in the front windows, turned to gape at him with reverence and\r\nawe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Verloc, giving a slight kick to the gladstone bag on the\r\nfloor; and Stevie flung himself upon it, seized it, bore it off with\r\ntriumphant devotion.  He was so prompt that Mr Verloc was distinctly\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nAlready at the clatter of the shop bell Mrs Neale, blackleading the\r\nparlour grate, had looked through the door, and rising from her knees had\r\ngone, aproned, and grimy with everlasting toil, to tell Mrs Verloc in the\r\nkitchen that \xe2\x80\x9cthere was the master come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinnie came no farther than the inner shop door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll want some breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d she said from a distance.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc moved his hands slightly, as if overcome by an impossible\r\nsuggestion.  But once enticed into the parlour he did not reject the food\r\nset before him.  He ate as if in a public place, his hat pushed off his\r\nforehead, the skirts of his heavy overcoat hanging in a triangle on each\r\nside of the chair.  And across the length of the table covered with brown\r\noil-cloth Winnie, his wife, talked evenly at him the wifely talk, as\r\nartfully adapted, no doubt, to the circumstances of this return as the\r\ntalk of Penelope to the return of the wandering Odysseus.  Mrs Verloc,\r\nhowever, had done no weaving during her husband\xe2\x80\x99s absence.  But she had\r\nhad all the upstairs room cleaned thoroughly, had sold some wares, had\r\nseen Mr Michaelis several times.  He had told her the last time that he\r\nwas going away to live in a cottage in the country, somewhere on the\r\nLondon, Chatham, and Dover line.  Karl Yundt had come too, once, led\r\nunder the arm by that \xe2\x80\x9cwicked old housekeeper of his.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\ndisgusting old man.\xe2\x80\x9d  Of Comrade Ossipon, whom she had received curtly,\r\nentrenched behind the counter with a stony face and a faraway gaze, she\r\nsaid nothing, her mental reference to the robust anarchist being marked\r\nby a short pause, with the faintest possible blush.  And bringing in her\r\nbrother Stevie as soon as she could into the current of domestic events,\r\nshe mentioned that the boy had moped a good deal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all along of mother leaving us like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc neither said, \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d nor yet \xe2\x80\x9cStevie be hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d  And Mrs\r\nVerloc, not let into the secret of his thoughts, failed to appreciate the\r\ngenerosity of this restraint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work as well as ever,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen making himself very useful.  You\xe2\x80\x99d think he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough for\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc directed a casual and somnolent glance at Stevie, who sat on\r\nhis right, delicate, pale-faced, his rosy mouth open vacantly.  It was\r\nnot a critical glance.  It had no intention.  And if Mr Verloc thought\r\nfor a moment that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s brother looked uncommonly useless, it was\r\nonly a dull and fleeting thought, devoid of that force and durability\r\nwhich enables sometimes a thought to move the world.  Leaning back, Mr\r\nVerloc uncovered his head.  Before his extended arm could put down the\r\nhat Stevie pounced upon it, and bore it off reverently into the kitchen.\r\nAnd again Mr Verloc was surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could do anything with that boy, Adolf,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc said, with her\r\nbest air of inflexible calmness.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe would go through fire for you.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused attentive, her ear turned towards the door of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThere Mrs Neale was scrubbing the floor.  At Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s appearance she\r\ngroaned lamentably, having observed that he could be induced easily to\r\nbestow for the benefit of her infant children the shilling his sister\r\nWinnie presented him with from time to time.  On all fours amongst the\r\npuddles, wet and begrimed, like a sort of amphibious and domestic animal\r\nliving in ash-bins and dirty water, she uttered the usual exordium: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall very well for you, kept doing nothing like a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she\r\nfollowed it with the everlasting plaint of the poor, pathetically\r\nmendacious, miserably authenticated by the horrible breath of cheap rum\r\nand soap-suds.  She scrubbed hard, snuffling all the time, and talking\r\nvolubly.  And she was sincere.  And on each side of her thin red nose her\r\nbleared, misty eyes swam in tears, because she felt really the want of\r\nsome sort of stimulant in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn the parlour Mrs Verloc observed, with knowledge:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs Neale at it again with her harrowing tales about her little\r\nchildren.  They can\xe2\x80\x99t be all so little as she makes them out.  Some of\r\nthem must be big enough by now to try to do something for themselves.  It\r\nonly makes Stevie angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were confirmed by a thud as of a fist striking the kitchen\r\ntable.  In the normal evolution of his sympathy Stevie had become angry\r\non discovering that he had no shilling in his pocket.  In his inability\r\nto relieve at once Mrs Neale\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clittle \xe2\x80\x99uns\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d privations, he felt that\r\nsomebody should be made to suffer for it.  Mrs Verloc rose, and went into\r\nthe kitchen to \xe2\x80\x9cstop that nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d  And she did it firmly but gently.\r\nShe was well aware that directly Mrs Neale received her money she went\r\nround the corner to drink ardent spirits in a mean and musty\r\npublic-house\xe2\x80\x94the unavoidable station on the _via dolorosa_ of her life.\r\nMrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s comment upon this practice had an unexpected profundity, as\r\ncoming from a person disinclined to look under the surface of things.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, what is she to do to keep up?  If I were like Mrs Neale I\r\nexpect I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t act any different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the same day, as Mr Verloc, coming with a start out\r\nof the last of a long series of dozes before the parlour fire, declared\r\nhis intention of going out for a walk, Winnie said from the shop:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would take that boy out with you, Adolf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the third time that day Mr Verloc was surprised.  He stared stupidly\r\nat his wife.  She continued in her steady manner.  The boy, whenever he\r\nwas not doing anything, moped in the house.  It made her uneasy; it made\r\nher nervous, she confessed.  And that from the calm Winnie sounded like\r\nexaggeration.  But, in truth, Stevie moped in the striking fashion of an\r\nunhappy domestic animal.  He would go up on the dark landing, to sit on\r\nthe floor at the foot of the tall clock, with his knees drawn up and his\r\nhead in his hands.  To come upon his pallid face, with its big eyes\r\ngleaming in the dusk, was discomposing; to think of him up there was\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc got used to the startling novelty of the idea.  He was fond of\r\nhis wife as a man should be\xe2\x80\x94that is, generously.  But a weighty objection\r\npresented itself to his mind, and he formulated it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll lose sight of me perhaps, and get lost in the street,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc shook her head competently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t know him.  That boy just worships you.  But if you\r\nshould miss him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc paused for a moment, but only for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just go on, and have your walk out.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry.  He\xe2\x80\x99ll be all\r\nright.  He\xe2\x80\x99s sure to turn up safe here before very long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis optimism procured for Mr Verloc his fourth surprise of the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he?\xe2\x80\x9d he grunted doubtfully.  But perhaps his brother-in-law was not\r\nsuch an idiot as he looked.  His wife would know best.  He turned away\r\nhis heavy eyes, saying huskily: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let him come along, then,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nrelapsed into the clutches of black care, that perhaps prefers to sit\r\nbehind a horseman, but knows also how to tread close on the heels of\r\npeople not sufficiently well off to keep horses\xe2\x80\x94like Mr Verloc, for\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nWinnie, at the shop door, did not see this fatal attendant upon Mr\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s walks.  She watched the two figures down the squalid street, one\r\ntall and burly, the other slight and short, with a thin neck, and the\r\npeaked shoulders raised slightly under the large semi-transparent ears.\r\nThe material of their overcoats was the same, their hats were black and\r\nround in shape.  Inspired by the similarity of wearing apparel, Mrs\r\nVerloc gave rein to her fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight be father and son,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself.  She thought also that Mr\r\nVerloc was as much of a father as poor Stevie ever had in his life.  She\r\nwas aware also that it was her work.  And with peaceful pride she\r\ncongratulated herself on a certain resolution she had taken a few years\r\nbefore.  It had cost her some effort, and even a few tears.\r\n\r\nShe congratulated herself still more on observing in the course of days\r\nthat Mr Verloc seemed to be taking kindly to Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s companionship.\r\nNow, when ready to go out for his walk, Mr Verloc called aloud to the\r\nboy, in the spirit, no doubt, in which a man invites the attendance of\r\nthe household dog, though, of course, in a different manner.  In the\r\nhouse Mr Verloc could be detected staring curiously at Stevie a good\r\ndeal.  His own demeanour had changed.  Taciturn still, he was not so\r\nlistless.  Mrs Verloc thought that he was rather jumpy at times.  It\r\nmight have been regarded as an improvement.  As to Stevie, he moped no\r\nlonger at the foot of the clock, but muttered to himself in corners\r\ninstead in a threatening tone.  When asked \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you\xe2\x80\x99re saying,\r\nStevie?\xe2\x80\x9d he merely opened his mouth, and squinted at his sister.  At odd\r\ntimes he clenched his fists without apparent cause, and when discovered\r\nin solitude would be scowling at the wall, with the sheet of paper and\r\nthe pencil given him for drawing circles lying blank and idle on the\r\nkitchen table.  This was a change, but it was no improvement.  Mrs Verloc\r\nincluding all these vagaries under the general definition of excitement,\r\nbegan to fear that Stevie was hearing more than was good for him of her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with his friends.  During his \xe2\x80\x9cwalks\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc,\r\nof course, met and conversed with various persons.  It could hardly be\r\notherwise.  His walks were an integral part of his outdoor activities,\r\nwhich his wife had never looked deeply into.  Mrs Verloc felt that the\r\nposition was delicate, but she faced it with the same impenetrable\r\ncalmness which impressed and even astonished the customers of the shop\r\nand made the other visitors keep their distance a little wonderingly.\r\nNo!  She feared that there were things not good for Stevie to hear of,\r\nshe told her husband.  It only excited the poor boy, because he could not\r\nhelp them being so.  Nobody could.\r\n\r\nIt was in the shop.  Mr Verloc made no comment.  He made no retort, and\r\nyet the retort was obvious.  But he refrained from pointing out to his\r\nwife that the idea of making Stevie the companion of his walks was her\r\nown, and nobody else\xe2\x80\x99s.  At that moment, to an impartial observer, Mr\r\nVerloc would have appeared more than human in his magnanimity.  He took\r\ndown a small cardboard box from a shelf, peeped in to see that the\r\ncontents were all right, and put it down gently on the counter.  Not till\r\nthat was done did he break the silence, to the effect that most likely\r\nStevie would profit greatly by being sent out of town for a while; only\r\nhe supposed his wife could not get on without him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould not get on without him!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Verloc slowly.  \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget on without him if it were for his good!  The idea!  Of course, I can\r\nget on without him.  But there\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere for him to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc got out some brown paper and a ball of string; and meanwhile he\r\nmuttered that Michaelis was living in a little cottage in the country.\r\nMichaelis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind giving Stevie a room to sleep in.  There were no\r\nvisitors and no talk there.  Michaelis was writing a book.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc declared her affection for Michaelis; mentioned her abhorrence\r\nof Karl Yundt, \xe2\x80\x9cnasty old man\xe2\x80\x9d; and of Ossipon she said nothing.  As to\r\nStevie, he could be no other than very pleased.  Mr Michaelis was always\r\nso nice and kind to him.  He seemed to like the boy.  Well, the boy was a\r\ngood boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou too seem to have grown quite fond of him of late,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after\r\na pause, with her inflexible assurance.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc tying up the cardboard box into a parcel for the post, broke\r\nthe string by an injudicious jerk, and muttered several swear words\r\nconfidentially to himself.  Then raising his tone to the usual husky\r\nmutter, he announced his willingness to take Stevie into the country\r\nhimself, and leave him all safe with Michaelis.\r\n\r\nHe carried out this scheme on the very next day.  Stevie offered no\r\nobjection.  He seemed rather eager, in a bewildered sort of way.  He\r\nturned his candid gaze inquisitively to Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s heavy countenance at\r\nfrequent intervals, especially when his sister was not looking at him.\r\nHis expression was proud, apprehensive, and concentrated, like that of a\r\nsmall child entrusted for the first time with a box of matches and the\r\npermission to strike a light.  But Mrs Verloc, gratified by her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndocility, recommended him not to dirty his clothes unduly in the country.\r\nAt this Stevie gave his sister, guardian and protector a look, which for\r\nthe first time in his life seemed to lack the quality of perfect\r\nchildlike trustfulness.  It was haughtily gloomy.  Mrs Verloc smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness me!  You needn\xe2\x80\x99t be offended.  You know you do get yourself\r\nvery untidy when you get a chance, Stevie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc was already gone some way down the street.\r\n\r\nThus in consequence of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s heroic proceedings, and of her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s absence on this villegiature, Mrs Verloc found herself oftener\r\nthan usual all alone not only in the shop, but in the house.  For Mr\r\nVerloc had to take his walks.  She was alone longer than usual on the day\r\nof the attempted bomb outrage in Greenwich Park, because Mr Verloc went\r\nout very early that morning and did not come back till nearly dusk.  She\r\ndid not mind being alone.  She had no desire to go out.  The weather was\r\ntoo bad, and the shop was cosier than the streets.  Sitting behind the\r\ncounter with some sewing, she did not raise her eyes from her work when\r\nMr Verloc entered in the aggressive clatter of the bell.  She had\r\nrecognised his step on the pavement outside.\r\n\r\nShe did not raise her eyes, but as Mr Verloc, silent, and with his hat\r\nrammed down upon his forehead, made straight for the parlour door, she\r\nsaid serenely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a wretched day.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve been perhaps to see Stevie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Verloc softly, and slammed the glazed parlour\r\ndoor behind him with unexpected energy.\r\n\r\nFor some time Mrs Verloc remained quiescent, with her work dropped in her\r\nlap, before she put it away under the counter and got up to light the\r\ngas.  This done, she went into the parlour on her way to the kitchen.  Mr\r\nVerloc would want his tea presently.  Confident of the power of her\r\ncharms, Winnie did not expect from her husband in the daily intercourse\r\nof their married life a ceremonious amenity of address and courtliness of\r\nmanner; vain and antiquated forms at best, probably never very exactly\r\nobserved, discarded nowadays even in the highest spheres, and always\r\nforeign to the standards of her class.  She did not look for courtesies\r\nfrom him.  But he was a good husband, and she had a loyal respect for his\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc would have gone through the parlour and on to her domestic\r\nduties in the kitchen with the perfect serenity of a woman sure of the\r\npower of her charms.  But a slight, very slight, and rapid rattling sound\r\ngrew upon her hearing.  Bizarre and incomprehensible, it arrested Mrs\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s attention.  Then as its character became plain to the ear she\r\nstopped short, amazed and concerned.  Striking a match on the box she\r\nheld in her hand, she turned on and lighted, above the parlour table, one\r\nof the two gas-burners, which, being defective, first whistled as if\r\nastonished, and then went on purring comfortably like a cat.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, against his usual practice, had thrown off his overcoat.  It\r\nwas lying on the sofa.  His hat, which he must also have thrown off,\r\nrested overturned under the edge of the sofa.  He had dragged a chair in\r\nfront of the fireplace, and his feet planted inside the fender, his head\r\nheld between his hands, he was hanging low over the glowing grate.  His\r\nteeth rattled with an ungovernable violence, causing his whole enormous\r\nback to tremble at the same rate.  Mrs Verloc was startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting wet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc managed to falter out, in a profound shudder.  By a\r\ngreat effort he suppressed the rattling of his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have you laid up on my hands,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with genuine uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mr Verloc, snuffling huskily.\r\n\r\nHe had certainly contrived somehow to catch an abominable cold between\r\nseven in the morning and five in the afternoon.  Mrs Verloc looked at his\r\nbowed back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr Verloc in a low, choked nasal tone.  His attitude\r\nsuggested aggrieved sulks or a severe headache.  The unsufficiency and\r\nuncandidness of his answer became painfully apparent in the dead silence\r\nof the room.  He snuffled apologetically, and added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the\r\nbank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc became attentive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have!\xe2\x80\x9d she said dispassionately.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc mumbled, with his nose over the grate, and with marked\r\nunwillingness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDraw the money out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?  All of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  All of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc spread out with care the scanty table-cloth, got two knives\r\nand two forks out of the table drawer, and suddenly stopped in her\r\nmethodical proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do that for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay want it soon,\xe2\x80\x9d snuffled vaguely Mr Verloc, who was coming to the end\r\nof his calculated indiscretions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked his wife in a tone perfectly\r\ncasual, but standing stock still between the table and the cupboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know you can trust me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc remarked to the grate, with hoarse\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc turned slowly towards the cupboard, saying with deliberation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes.  I can trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she went on with her methodical proceedings.  She laid two plates,\r\ngot the bread, the butter, going to and fro quietly between the table and\r\nthe cupboard in the peace and silence of her home.  On the point of\r\ntaking out the jam, she reflected practically: \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be feeling\r\nhungry, having been away all day,\xe2\x80\x9d and she returned to the cupboard once\r\nmore to get the cold beef.  She set it under the purring gas-jet, and\r\nwith a passing glance at her motionless husband hugging the fire, she\r\nwent (down two steps) into the kitchen.  It was only when coming back,\r\ncarving knife and fork in hand, that she spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t trusted you I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have married you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBowed under the overmantel, Mr Verloc, holding his head in both hands,\r\nseemed to have gone to sleep.  Winnie made the tea, and called out in an\r\nundertone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdolf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc got up at once, and staggered a little before he sat down at\r\nthe table.  His wife examining the sharp edge of the carving knife,\r\nplaced it on the dish, and called his attention to the cold beef.  He\r\nremained insensible to the suggestion, with his chin on his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should feed your cold,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc said dogmatically.\r\n\r\nHe looked up, and shook his head.  His eyes were bloodshot and his face\r\nred.  His fingers had ruffled his hair into a dissipated untidiness.\r\nAltogether he had a disreputable aspect, expressive of the discomfort,\r\nthe irritation and the gloom following a heavy debauch.  But Mr Verloc\r\nwas not a debauched man.  In his conduct he was respectable.  His\r\nappearance might have been the effect of a feverish cold.  He drank three\r\ncups of tea, but abstained from food entirely.  He recoiled from it with\r\nsombre aversion when urged by Mrs Verloc, who said at last:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t your feet wet?  You had better put on your slippers.  You aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngoing out any more this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc intimated by morose grunts and signs that his feet were not\r\nwet, and that anyhow he did not care.  The proposal as to slippers was\r\ndisregarded as beneath his notice.  But the question of going out in the\r\nevening received an unexpected development.  It was not of going out in\r\nthe evening that Mr Verloc was thinking.  His thoughts embraced a vaster\r\nscheme.  From moody and incomplete phrases it became apparent that Mr\r\nVerloc had been considering the expediency of emigrating.  It was not\r\nvery clear whether he had in his mind France or California.\r\n\r\nThe utter unexpectedness, improbability, and inconceivableness of such an\r\nevent robbed this vague declaration of all its effect.  Mrs Verloc, as\r\nplacidly as if her husband had been threatening her with the end of the\r\nworld, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc declared himself sick and tired of everything, and besides\xe2\x80\x94She\r\ninterrupted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve a bad cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed obvious that Mr Verloc was not in his usual state,\r\nphysically and even mentally.  A sombre irresolution held him silent for\r\na while.  Then he murmured a few ominous generalities on the theme of\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill have to,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Winnie, sitting calmly back, with folded arms,\r\nopposite her husband.  \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know who\xe2\x80\x99s to make you.  You\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t a slave.  No one need be a slave in this country\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t you make\r\nyourself one.\xe2\x80\x9d  She paused, and with invincible and steady candour.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nbusiness isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve a comfortable home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced all round the parlour, from the corner cupboard to the good\r\nfire in the grate.  Ensconced cosily behind the shop of doubtful wares,\r\nwith the mysteriously dim window, and its door suspiciously ajar in the\r\nobscure and narrow street, it was in all essentials of domestic propriety\r\nand domestic comfort a respectable home.  Her devoted affection missed\r\nout of it her brother Stevie, now enjoying a damp villegiature in the\r\nKentish lanes under the care of Mr Michaelis.  She missed him poignantly,\r\nwith all the force of her protecting passion.  This was the boy\xe2\x80\x99s home\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94the roof, the cupboard, the stoked grate.  On this thought Mrs Verloc\r\nrose, and walking to the other end of the table, said in the fulness of\r\nher heart:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are not tired of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc made no sound.  Winnie leaned on his shoulder from behind, and\r\npressed her lips to his forehead.  Thus she lingered.  Not a whisper\r\nreached them from the outside world.\r\n\r\nThe sound of footsteps on the pavement died out in the discreet dimness\r\nof the shop.  Only the gas-jet above the table went on purring equably in\r\nthe brooding silence of the parlour.\r\n\r\nDuring the contact of that unexpected and lingering kiss Mr Verloc,\r\ngripping with both hands the edges of his chair, preserved a hieratic\r\nimmobility.  When the pressure was removed he let go the chair, rose, and\r\nwent to stand before the fireplace.  He turned no longer his back to the\r\nroom.  With his features swollen and an air of being drugged, he followed\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s movements with his eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc went about serenely, clearing up the table.  Her tranquil\r\nvoice commented the idea thrown out in a reasonable and domestic tone.\r\nIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand examination.  She condemned it from every point of\r\nview.  But her only real concern was Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s welfare.  He appeared to\r\nher thought in that connection as sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiar\xe2\x80\x9d not to be taken\r\nrashly abroad.  And that was all.  But talking round that vital point,\r\nshe approached absolute vehemence in her delivery.  Meanwhile, with\r\nbrusque movements, she arrayed herself in an apron for the washing up of\r\ncups.  And as if excited by the sound of her uncontradicted voice, she\r\nwent so far as to say in a tone almost tart:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you go abroad you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go without me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Verloc huskily, and the unresonant voice\r\nof his private life trembled with an enigmatical emotion.\r\n\r\nAlready Mrs Verloc was regretting her words.  They had sounded more\r\nunkind than she meant them to be.  They had also the unwisdom of\r\nunnecessary things.  In fact, she had not meant them at all.  It was a\r\nsort of phrase that is suggested by the demon of perverse inspiration.\r\nBut she knew a way to make it as if it had not been.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head over her shoulder and gave that man planted heavily\r\nin front of the fireplace a glance, half arch, half cruel, out of her\r\nlarge eyes\xe2\x80\x94a glance of which the Winnie of the Belgravian mansion days\r\nwould have been incapable, because of her respectability and her\r\nignorance.  But the man was her husband now, and she was no longer\r\nignorant.  She kept it on him for a whole second, with her grave face\r\nmotionless like a mask, while she said playfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.  You would miss me too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc started forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a louder tone, throwing his arms out and making a\r\nstep towards her.  Something wild and doubtful in his expression made it\r\nappear uncertain whether he meant to strangle or to embrace his wife.\r\nBut Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s attention was called away from that manifestation by the\r\nclatter of the shop bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShop, Adolf.  You go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, his arms came down slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Verloc.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my apron on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc obeyed woodenly, stony-eyed, and like an automaton whose face\r\nhad been painted red.  And this resemblance to a mechanical figure went\r\nso far that he had an automaton\xe2\x80\x99s absurd air of being aware of the\r\nmachinery inside of him.\r\n\r\nHe closed the parlour door, and Mrs Verloc moving briskly, carried the\r\ntray into the kitchen.  She washed the cups and some other things before\r\nshe stopped in her work to listen.  No sound reached her.  The customer\r\nwas a long time in the shop.  It was a customer, because if he had not\r\nbeen Mr Verloc would have taken him inside.  Undoing the strings of her\r\napron with a jerk, she threw it on a chair, and walked back to the\r\nparlour slowly.\r\n\r\nAt that precise moment Mr Verloc entered from the shop.\r\n\r\nHe had gone in red.  He came out a strange papery white.  His face,\r\nlosing its drugged, feverish stupor, had in that short time acquired a\r\nbewildered and harassed expression.  He walked straight to the sofa, and\r\nstood looking down at his overcoat lying there, as though he were afraid\r\nto touch it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs Verloc in a subdued voice.  Through the\r\ndoor left ajar she could see that the customer was not gone yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go out this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Verloc.  He did not\r\nattempt to pick up his outer garment.\r\n\r\nWithout a word Winnie made for the shop, and shutting the door after her,\r\nwalked in behind the counter.  She did not look overtly at the customer\r\ntill she had established herself comfortably on the chair.  But by that\r\ntime she had noted that he was tall and thin, and wore his moustaches\r\ntwisted up.  In fact, he gave the sharp points a twist just then.  His\r\nlong, bony face rose out of a turned-up collar.  He was a little\r\nsplashed, a little wet.  A dark man, with the ridge of the cheek-bone\r\nwell defined under the slightly hollow temple.  A complete stranger.  Not\r\na customer either.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc looked at him placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came over from the Continent?\xe2\x80\x9d she said after a time.\r\n\r\nThe long, thin stranger, without exactly looking at Mrs Verloc, answered\r\nonly by a faint and peculiar smile.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s steady, incurious gaze rested on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand English, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes.  I understand English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing foreign in his accent, except that he seemed in his\r\nslow enunciation to be taking pains with it.  And Mrs Verloc, in her\r\nvaried experience, had come to the conclusion that some foreigners could\r\nspeak better English than the natives.  She said, looking at the door of\r\nthe parlour fixedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think perhaps of staying in England for good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger gave her again a silent smile.  He had a kindly mouth and\r\nprobing eyes.  And he shook his head a little sadly, it seemed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband will see you through all right.  Meantime for a few days you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do better than take lodgings with Mr Giugliani.  Continental\r\nHotel it\xe2\x80\x99s called.  Private.  It\xe2\x80\x99s quiet.  My husband will take you\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said the thin, dark man, whose glance had hardened\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew Mr Verloc before\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?  Perhaps in France?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of him,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted the visitor in his slow, painstaking\r\ntone, which yet had a certain curtness of intention.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.  Then he spoke again, in a far less elaborate manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband has not gone out to wait for me in the street by chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the street!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs Verloc, surprised.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.  There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno other door to the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment she sat impassive, then left her seat to go and peep through\r\nthe glazed door.  Suddenly she opened it, and disappeared into the\r\nparlour.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc had done no more than put on his overcoat.  But why he should\r\nremain afterwards leaning over the table propped up on his two arms as\r\nthough he were feeling giddy or sick, she could not understand.  \xe2\x80\x9cAdolf,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe called out half aloud; and when he had raised himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that man?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked rapidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of him,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered uneasily Mr Verloc, darting a wild glance\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s fine, incurious eyes lighted up with a flash of abhorrence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of Karl Yundt\xe2\x80\x99s friends\xe2\x80\x94beastly old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!  No!\xe2\x80\x9d protested Mr Verloc, busy fishing for his hat.  But when he\r\ngot it from under the sofa he held it as if he did not know the use of a\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Verloc at last.  \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Adolf, he\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t one of them Embassy people you have been bothered with of late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBothered with Embassy people,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr Verloc, with a heavy start of\r\nsurprise and fear.  \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s been talking to you of the Embassy people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!  I!  Talked of the Embassy to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc seemed scared and bewildered beyond measure.  His wife\r\nexplained:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking a little in your sleep of late, Adolf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94what did I say?  What do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing much.  It seemed mostly nonsense.  Enough to let me guess that\r\nsomething worried you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc rammed his hat on his head.  A crimson flood of anger ran over\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense\xe2\x80\x94eh?  The Embassy people!  I would cut their hearts out one\r\nafter another.  But let them look out.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a tongue in my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fumed, pacing up and down between the table and the sofa, his open\r\novercoat catching against the angles.  The red flood of anger ebbed out,\r\nand left his face all white, with quivering nostrils.  Mrs Verloc, for\r\nthe purposes of practical existence, put down these appearances to the\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cget rid of the man, whoever he is, as soon as you can,\r\nand come back home to me.  You want looking after for a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc calmed down, and, with resolution imprinted on his pale face,\r\nhad already opened the door, when his wife called him back in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdolf!  Adolf!\xe2\x80\x9d  He came back startled.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about that money you drew\r\nout?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got it in your pocket?  Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc gazed stupidly into the palm of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s extended hand for\r\nsome time before he slapped his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney!  Yes!  Yes!  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what you meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew out of his breast pocket a new pigskin pocket-book.  Mrs Verloc\r\nreceived it without another word, and stood still till the bell,\r\nclattering after Mr Verloc and Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s visitor, had quieted down.\r\nOnly then she peeped in at the amount, drawing the notes out for the\r\npurpose.  After this inspection she looked round thoughtfully, with an\r\nair of mistrust in the silence and solitude of the house.  This abode of\r\nher married life appeared to her as lonely and unsafe as though it had\r\nbeen situated in the midst of a forest.  No receptacle she could think of\r\namongst the solid, heavy furniture seemed other but flimsy and\r\nparticularly tempting to her conception of a house-breaker.  It was an\r\nideal conception, endowed with sublime faculties and a miraculous\r\ninsight.  The till was not to be thought of.  It was the first spot a\r\nthief would make for.  Mrs Verloc unfastening hastily a couple of hooks,\r\nslipped the pocket-book under the bodice of her dress.  Having thus\r\ndisposed of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s capital, she was rather glad to hear the\r\nclatter of the door bell, announcing an arrival.  Assuming the fixed,\r\nunabashed stare and the stony expression reserved for the casual\r\ncustomer, she walked in behind the counter.\r\n\r\nA man standing in the middle of the shop was inspecting it with a swift,\r\ncool, all-round glance.  His eyes ran over the walls, took in the\r\nceiling, noted the floor\xe2\x80\x94all in a moment.  The points of a long fair\r\nmoustache fell below the line of the jaw.  He smiled the smile of an old\r\nif distant acquaintance, and Mrs Verloc remembered having seen him\r\nbefore.  Not a customer.  She softened her \xe2\x80\x9ccustomer stare\xe2\x80\x9d to mere\r\nindifference, and faced him across the counter.\r\n\r\nHe approached, on his side, confidentially, but not too markedly so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHusband at home, Mrs Verloc?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in an easy, full tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  He\xe2\x80\x99s gone out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for that.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve called to get from him a little private\r\ninformation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the exact truth.  Chief Inspector Heat had been all the way\r\nhome, and had even gone so far as to think of getting into his slippers,\r\nsince practically he was, he told himself, chucked out of that case.  He\r\nindulged in some scornful and in a few angry thoughts, and found the\r\noccupation so unsatisfactory that he resolved to seek relief out of\r\ndoors.  Nothing prevented him paying a friendly call to Mr Verloc,\r\ncasually as it were.  It was in the character of a private citizen that\r\nwalking out privately he made use of his customary conveyances.  Their\r\ngeneral direction was towards Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s home.  Chief Inspector Heat\r\nrespected his own private character so consistently that he took especial\r\npains to avoid all the police constables on point and patrol duty in the\r\nvicinity of Brett Street.  This precaution was much more necessary for a\r\nman of his standing than for an obscure Assistant Commissioner.  Private\r\nCitizen Heat entered the street, manoeuvring in a way which in a member\r\nof the criminal classes would have been stigmatised as slinking.  The\r\npiece of cloth picked up in Greenwich was in his pocket.  Not that he had\r\nthe slightest intention of producing it in his private capacity.  On the\r\ncontrary, he wanted to know just what Mr Verloc would be disposed to say\r\nvoluntarily.  He hoped Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s talk would be of a nature to\r\nincriminate Michaelis.  It was a conscientiously professional hope in the\r\nmain, but not without its moral value.  For Chief Inspector Heat was a\r\nservant of justice.  Finding Mr Verloc from home, he felt disappointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would wait for him a little if I were sure he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be long,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc volunteered no assurance of any kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe information I need is quite private,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou understand\r\nwhat I mean?  I wonder if you could give me a notion where he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away to range some boxes on the shelves behind the counter.\r\nChief Inspector Heat looked at her thoughtfully for a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc glanced over her shoulder.  Chief Inspector Heat was amazed at\r\nher coolness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!  You know I am in the police,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble my head much about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc remarked, returning\r\nto the ranging of her boxes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Heat.  Chief Inspector Heat of the Special Crimes section.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc adjusted nicely in its place a small cardboard box, and\r\nturning round, faced him again, heavy-eyed, with idle hands hanging down.\r\nA silence reigned for a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo your husband went out a quarter of an hour ago!  And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nwhen he would be back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc let fall negligently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc touched the back of her hair.  It was in perfect order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stranger who called.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see.  What sort of man was that stranger?  Would you mind telling me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc did not mind.  And when Chief Inspector Heat heard of a man\r\ndark, thin, with a long face and turned up moustaches, he gave signs of\r\nperturbation, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDash me if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so!  He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was intensely disgusted in the secrecy of his heart at the unofficial\r\nconduct of his immediate chief.  But he was not quixotic.  He lost all\r\ndesire to await Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s return.  What they had gone out for he did\r\nnot know, but he imagined it possible that they would return together.\r\nThe case is not followed properly, it\xe2\x80\x99s being tampered with, he thought\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I haven\xe2\x80\x99t time to wait for your husband,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc received this declaration listlessly.  Her detachment had\r\nimpressed Chief Inspector Heat all along.  At this precise moment it\r\nwhetted his curiosity.  Chief Inspector Heat hung in the wind, swayed by\r\nhis passions like the most private of citizens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at her steadily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you could give me a\r\npretty good notion of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on if you liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nForcing her fine, inert eyes to return his gaze, Mrs Verloc murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing on!  What _is_ going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the affair I came to talk about a little with your husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat day Mrs Verloc had glanced at a morning paper as usual.  But she had\r\nnot stirred out of doors.  The newsboys never invaded Brett Street.  It\r\nwas not a street for their business.  And the echo of their cries\r\ndrifting along the populous thoroughfares, expired between the dirty\r\nbrick walls without reaching the threshold of the shop.  Her husband had\r\nnot brought an evening paper home.  At any rate she had not seen it.  Mrs\r\nVerloc knew nothing whatever of any affair.  And she said so, with a\r\ngenuine note of wonder in her quiet voice.\r\n\r\nChief Inspector Heat did not believe for a moment in so much ignorance.\r\nCurtly, without amiability, he stated the bare fact.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc turned away her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call it silly,\xe2\x80\x9d she pronounced slowly.  She paused.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndowntrodden slaves here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector waited watchfully.  Nothing more came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your husband didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention anything to you when he came home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc simply turned her face from right to left in sign of negation.\r\nA languid, baffling silence reigned in the shop.  Chief Inspector Heat\r\nfelt provoked beyond endurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was another small matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he began in a detached tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I\r\nwanted to speak to your husband about.  There came into our hands\r\na\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94what we believe is\xe2\x80\x94a stolen overcoat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, with her mind specially aware of thieves that evening,\r\ntouched lightly the bosom of her dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have lost no overcoat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s funny,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Private Citizen Heat.  \xe2\x80\x9cI see you keep a lot of\r\nmarking ink here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took up a small bottle, and looked at it against the gas-jet in the\r\nmiddle of the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPurple\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, setting it down again.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrange.  Because the overcoat has got a label sewn on the inside with\r\nyour address written in marking ink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc leaned over the counter with a low exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my brother\xe2\x80\x99s, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your brother?  Can I see him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Chief Inspector\r\nbriskly.  Mrs Verloc leaned a little more over the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  He isn\xe2\x80\x99t here.  I wrote that label myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your brother now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been away living with\xe2\x80\x94a friend\xe2\x80\x94in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe overcoat comes from the country.  And what\xe2\x80\x99s the name of the\r\nfriend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichaelis,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed Mrs Verloc in an awed whisper.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector let out a whistle.  His eyes snapped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so.  Capital.  And your brother now, what\xe2\x80\x99s he like\xe2\x80\x94a sturdy,\r\ndarkish chap\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs Verloc fervently.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat must be the thief.\r\nStevie\xe2\x80\x99s slight and fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chief Inspector in an approving tone.  And while Mrs\r\nVerloc, wavering between alarm and wonder, stared at him, he sought for\r\ninformation.  Why have the address sewn like this inside the coat?  And\r\nhe heard that the mangled remains he had inspected that morning with\r\nextreme repugnance were those of a youth, nervous, absent-minded,\r\npeculiar, and also that the woman who was speaking to him had had the\r\ncharge of that boy since he was a baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasily excitable?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes.  He is.  But how did he come to lose his coat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChief Inspector Heat suddenly pulled out a pink newspaper he had bought\r\nless than half-an-hour ago.  He was interested in horses.  Forced by his\r\ncalling into an attitude of doubt and suspicion towards his\r\nfellow-citizens, Chief Inspector Heat relieved the instinct of credulity\r\nimplanted in the human breast by putting unbounded faith in the sporting\r\nprophets of that particular evening publication.  Dropping the extra\r\nspecial on to the counter, he plunged his hand again into his pocket, and\r\npulling out the piece of cloth fate had presented him with out of a heap\r\nof things that seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops,\r\nhe offered it to Mrs Verloc for inspection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you recognise this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it mechanically in both her hands.  Her eyes seemed to grow\r\nbigger as she looked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, then raised her head, and staggered backward a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever for is it torn out like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector snatched across the counter the cloth out of her\r\nhands, and she sat heavily on the chair.  He thought: identification\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfect.  And in that moment he had a glimpse into the whole amazing\r\ntruth.  Verloc was the \xe2\x80\x9cother man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Verloc,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit strikes me that you know more of this bomb\r\naffair than even you yourself are aware of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc sat still, amazed, lost in boundless astonishment.  What was\r\nthe connection?  And she became so rigid all over that she was not able\r\nto turn her head at the clatter of the bell, which caused the private\r\ninvestigator Heat to spin round on his heel.  Mr Verloc had shut the\r\ndoor, and for a moment the two men looked at each other.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, without looking at his wife, walked up to the Chief Inspector,\r\nwho was relieved to see him return alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou here!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mr Verloc heavily.  \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you after?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chief Inspector Heat in a low tone.  \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, I would\r\nlike a word or two with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, still pale, had brought an air of resolution with him.  Still\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at his wife.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in here, then.\xe2\x80\x9d  And he led the way into the parlour.\r\n\r\nThe door was hardly shut when Mrs Verloc, jumping up from the chair, ran\r\nto it as if to fling it open, but instead of doing so fell on her knees,\r\nwith her ear to the keyhole.  The two men must have stopped directly they\r\nwere through, because she heard plainly the Chief Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\r\nthough she could not see his finger pressed against her husband\xe2\x80\x99s breast\r\nemphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the other man, Verloc.  Two men were seen entering the park.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the voice of Mr Verloc said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, take me now.  What\xe2\x80\x99s to prevent you?  You have the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!  I know too well who you have been giving yourself away to.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to manage this little affair all by himself.  But don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nmake a mistake, it\xe2\x80\x99s I who found you out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she heard only muttering.  Inspector Heat must have been showing to\r\nMr Verloc the piece of Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat, because Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\r\nguardian, and protector heard her husband a little louder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never noticed that she had hit upon that dodge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain for a time Mrs Verloc heard nothing but murmurs, whose\r\nmysteriousness was less nightmarish to her brain than the horrible\r\nsuggestions of shaped words.  Then Chief Inspector Heat, on the other\r\nside of the door, raised his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have been mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s voice answered, with a sort of gloomy fury:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been mad for a month or more, but I am not mad now.  It\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nover.  It shall all come out of my head, and hang the consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, and then Private Citizen Heat murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s coming out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the voice of Mr Verloc, and then sank very low.\r\n\r\nAfter a while it rose again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have known me for several years now, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve found me useful,\r\ntoo.  You know I was a straight man.  Yes, straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeal to old acquaintance must have been extremely distasteful to\r\nthe Chief Inspector.\r\n\r\nHis voice took on a warning note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you trust so much to what you have been promised.  If I were you I\r\nwould clear out.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we will run after you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc was heard to laugh a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; you hope the others will get rid of me for you\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you?  No,\r\nno; you don\xe2\x80\x99t shake me off now.  I have been a straight man to those\r\npeople too long, and now everything must come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it come out, then,\xe2\x80\x9d the indifferent voice of Chief Inspector Heat\r\nassented.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me now how did you get away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was making for Chesterfield Walk,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc heard her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I heard the bang.  I started running then.  Fog.  I saw no\r\none till I was past the end of George Street.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I met anyone\r\ntill then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo easy as that!\xe2\x80\x9d marvelled the voice of Chief Inspector Heat.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nbang startled you, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it came too soon,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed the gloomy, husky voice of Mr Verloc.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc pressed her ear to the keyhole; her lips were blue, her hands\r\ncold as ice, and her pale face, in which the two eyes seemed like two\r\nblack holes, felt to her as if it were enveloped in flames.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the door the voices sank very low.  She caught words\r\nnow and then, sometimes in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s voice, sometimes in the smooth\r\ntones of the Chief Inspector.  She heard this last say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe he stumbled against the root of a tree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a husky, voluble murmur, which lasted for some time, and then\r\nthe Chief Inspector, as if answering some inquiry, spoke emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.  Blown to small bits: limbs, gravel, clothing, bones,\r\nsplinters\xe2\x80\x94all mixed up together.  I tell you they had to fetch a shovel\r\nto gather him up with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc sprang up suddenly from her crouching position, and stopping\r\nher ears, reeled to and fro between the counter and the shelves on the\r\nwall towards the chair.  Her crazed eyes noted the sporting sheet left by\r\nthe Chief Inspector, and as she knocked herself against the counter she\r\nsnatched it up, fell into the chair, tore the optimistic, rosy sheet\r\nright across in trying to open it, then flung it on the floor.  On the\r\nother side of the door, Chief Inspector Heat was saying to Mr Verloc, the\r\nsecret agent:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo your defence will be practically a full confession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will.  I am going to tell the whole story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be believed as much as you fancy you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the Chief Inspector remained thoughtful.  The turn this affair was\r\ntaking meant the disclosure of many things\xe2\x80\x94the laying waste of fields of\r\nknowledge, which, cultivated by a capable man, had a distinct value for\r\nthe individual and for the society.  It was sorry, sorry meddling.  It\r\nwould leave Michaelis unscathed; it would drag to light the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhome industry; disorganise the whole system of supervision; make no end\r\nof a row in the papers, which, from that point of view, appeared to him\r\nby a sudden illumination as invariably written by fools for the reading\r\nof imbeciles.  Mentally he agreed with the words Mr Verloc let fall at\r\nlast in answer to his last remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not.  But it will upset many things.  I have been a straight\r\nman, and I shall keep straight in this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they let you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chief Inspector cynically.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be\r\npreached to, no doubt, before they put you into the dock.  And in the end\r\nyou may yet get let in for a sentence that will surprise you.  I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrust too much the gentleman who\xe2\x80\x99s been talking to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc listened, frowning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy advice to you is to clear out while you may.  I have no instructions.\r\nThere are some of them,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Chief Inspector Heat, laying a\r\npeculiar stress on the word \xe2\x80\x9cthem,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwho think you are already out of the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc was moved to say.  Though since his return from\r\nGreenwich he had spent most of his time sitting in the tap-room of an\r\nobscure little public-house, he could hardly have hoped for such\r\nfavourable news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the impression about you.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Chief Inspector nodded at him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVanish.  Clear out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d snarled Mr Verloc.  He raised his head, and gazing at the\r\nclosed door of the parlour, muttered feelingly: \xe2\x80\x9cI only wish you would\r\ntake me away to-night.  I would go quietly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay,\xe2\x80\x9d assented sardonically the Chief Inspector, following the\r\ndirection of his glance.\r\n\r\nThe brow of Mr Verloc broke into slight moisture.  He lowered his husky\r\nvoice confidentially before the unmoved Chief Inspector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lad was half-witted, irresponsible.  Any court would have seen that\r\nat once.  Only fit for the asylum.  And that was the worst that would\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhappened to him if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector, his hand on the door handle, whispered into Mr\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may\xe2\x80\x99ve been half-witted, but you must have been crazy.  What drove\r\nyou off your head like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, thinking of Mr Vladimir, did not hesitate in the choice of\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Hyperborean swine,\xe2\x80\x9d he hissed forcibly.  \xe2\x80\x9cA what you might call a\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chief Inspector, steady-eyed, nodded briefly his comprehension, and\r\nopened the door.  Mrs Verloc, behind the counter, might have heard but\r\ndid not see his departure, pursued by the aggressive clatter of the bell.\r\nShe sat at her post of duty behind the counter.  She sat rigidly erect in\r\nthe chair with two dirty pink pieces of paper lying spread out at her\r\nfeet.  The palms of her hands were pressed convulsively to her face, with\r\nthe tips of the fingers contracted against the forehead, as though the\r\nskin had been a mask which she was ready to tear off violently.  The\r\nperfect immobility of her pose expressed the agitation of rage and\r\ndespair, all the potential violence of tragic passions, better than any\r\nshallow display of shrieks, with the beating of a distracted head against\r\nthe walls, could have done.  Chief Inspector Heat, crossing the shop at\r\nhis busy, swinging pace, gave her only a cursory glance.  And when the\r\ncracked bell ceased to tremble on its curved ribbon of steel nothing\r\nstirred near Mrs Verloc, as if her attitude had the locking power of a\r\nspell.  Even the butterfly-shaped gas flames posed on the ends of the\r\nsuspended T-bracket burned without a quiver.  In that shop of shady wares\r\nfitted with deal shelves painted a dull brown, which seemed to devour the\r\nsheen of the light, the gold circlet of the wedding ring on Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleft hand glittered exceedingly with the untarnished glory of a piece\r\nfrom some splendid treasure of jewels, dropped in a dust-bin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner, driven rapidly in a hansom from the\r\nneighbourhood of Soho in the direction of Westminster, got out at the\r\nvery centre of the Empire on which the sun never sets.  Some stalwart\r\nconstables, who did not seem particularly impressed by the duty of\r\nwatching the august spot, saluted him.  Penetrating through a portal by\r\nno means lofty into the precincts of the House which is _the_ House, _par\r\nexcellence_ in the minds of many millions of men, he was met at last by\r\nthe volatile and revolutionary Toodles.\r\n\r\nThat neat and nice young man concealed his astonishment at the early\r\nappearance of the Assistant Commissioner, whom he had been told to look\r\nout for some time about midnight.  His turning up so early he concluded\r\nto be the sign that things, whatever they were, had gone wrong.  With an\r\nextremely ready sympathy, which in nice youngsters goes often with a\r\njoyous temperament, he felt sorry for the great Presence he called \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nChief,\xe2\x80\x9d and also for the Assistant Commissioner, whose face appeared to\r\nhim more ominously wooden than ever before, and quite wonderfully long.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a queer, foreign-looking chap he is,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself,\r\nsmiling from a distance with friendly buoyancy.  And directly they came\r\ntogether he began to talk with the kind intention of burying the\r\nawkwardness of failure under a heap of words.  It looked as if the great\r\nassault threatened for that night were going to fizzle out.  An inferior\r\nhenchman of \xe2\x80\x9cthat brute Cheeseman\xe2\x80\x9d was up boring mercilessly a very thin\r\nHouse with some shamelessly cooked statistics.  He, Toodles, hoped he\r\nwould bore them into a count out every minute.  But then he might be only\r\nmarking time to let that guzzling Cheeseman dine at his leisure.  Anyway,\r\nthe Chief could not be persuaded to go home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will see you at once, I think.  He\xe2\x80\x99s sitting all alone in his room\r\nthinking of all the fishes of the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Toodles airily.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nalong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the kindness of his disposition, the young private\r\nsecretary (unpaid) was accessible to the common failings of humanity.  He\r\ndid not wish to harrow the feelings of the Assistant Commissioner, who\r\nlooked to him uncommonly like a man who has made a mess of his job.  But\r\nhis curiosity was too strong to be restrained by mere compassion.  He\r\ncould not help, as they went along, to throw over his shoulder lightly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your sprat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Assistant Commissioner with a concision which did\r\nnot mean to be repellent in the least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea how these great men dislike to be disappointed in\r\nsmall things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this profound observation the experienced Toodles seemed to\r\nreflect.  At any rate he said nothing for quite two seconds.  Then:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad.  But\xe2\x80\x94I say\xe2\x80\x94is it really such a very small thing as you make it\r\nout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what may be done with a sprat?\xe2\x80\x9d the Assistant Commissioner\r\nasked in his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes put into a sardine box,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Toodles, whose\r\nerudition on the subject of the fishing industry was fresh and, in\r\ncomparison with his ignorance of all other industrial matters, immense.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are sardine canneries on the Spanish coast which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner interrupted the apprentice statesman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  Yes.  But a sprat is also thrown away sometimes in order to catch\r\na whale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA whale.  Phew!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Toodles, with bated breath.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re after a\r\nwhale, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly.  What I am after is more like a dog-fish.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nperhaps what a dog-fish is like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I do.  We\xe2\x80\x99re buried in special books up to our necks\xe2\x80\x94whole shelves\r\nfull of them\xe2\x80\x94with plates. . . . It\xe2\x80\x99s a noxious, rascally-looking,\r\naltogether detestable beast, with a sort of smooth face and moustaches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDescribed to a T,\xe2\x80\x9d commended the Assistant Commissioner.  \xe2\x80\x9cOnly mine is\r\nclean-shaven altogether.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a witty fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Toodles incredulously.  \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t conceive where I\r\ncould have seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Explorers, I should say,\xe2\x80\x9d dropped the Assistant Commissioner\r\ncalmly.  At the name of that extremely exclusive club Toodles looked\r\nscared, and stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested, but in an awe-struck tone.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\r\nA member?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonorary,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the Assistant Commissioner through his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToodles looked so thunderstruck that the Assistant Commissioner smiled\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s between ourselves strictly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the beastliest thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d declared\r\nToodles feebly, as if astonishment had robbed him of all his buoyant\r\nstrength in a second.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner gave him an unsmiling glance.  Till they came\r\nto the door of the great man\xe2\x80\x99s room, Toodles preserved a scandalised and\r\nsolemn silence, as though he were offended with the Assistant\r\nCommissioner for exposing such an unsavoury and disturbing fact.  It\r\nrevolutionised his idea of the Explorers\xe2\x80\x99 Club\xe2\x80\x99s extreme selectness, of\r\nits social purity.  Toodles was revolutionary only in politics; his\r\nsocial beliefs and personal feelings he wished to preserve unchanged\r\nthrough all the years allotted to him on this earth which, upon the\r\nwhole, he believed to be a nice place to live on.\r\n\r\nHe stood aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in without knocking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShades of green silk fitted low over all the lights imparted to the room\r\nsomething of a forest\xe2\x80\x99s deep gloom.  The haughty eyes were physically the\r\ngreat man\xe2\x80\x99s weak point.  This point was wrapped up in secrecy.  When an\r\nopportunity offered, he rested them conscientiously.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner entering saw at first only a big pale hand\r\nsupporting a big head, and concealing the upper part of a big pale face.\r\nAn open despatch-box stood on the writing-table near a few oblong sheets\r\nof paper and a scattered handful of quill pens.  There was absolutely\r\nnothing else on the large flat surface except a little bronze statuette\r\ndraped in a toga, mysteriously watchful in its shadowy immobility.  The\r\nAssistant Commissioner, invited to take a chair, sat down.  In the dim\r\nlight, the salient points of his personality, the long face, the black\r\nhair, his lankness, made him look more foreign than ever.\r\n\r\nThe great man manifested no surprise, no eagerness, no sentiment\r\nwhatever.  The attitude in which he rested his menaced eyes was\r\nprofoundly meditative.  He did not alter it the least bit.  But his tone\r\nwas not dreamy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!  What is it that you\xe2\x80\x99ve found out already?  You came upon\r\nsomething unexpected on the first step.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly unexpected, Sir Ethelred.  What I mainly came upon was a\r\npsychological state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Great Presence made a slight movement.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be lucid, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Ethelred.  You know no doubt that most criminals at some time\r\nor other feel an irresistible need of confessing\xe2\x80\x94of making a clean breast\r\nof it to somebody\xe2\x80\x94to anybody.  And they do it often to the police.  In\r\nthat Verloc whom Heat wished so much to screen I\xe2\x80\x99ve found a man in that\r\nparticular psychological state.  The man, figuratively speaking, flung\r\nhimself on my breast.  It was enough on my part to whisper to him who I\r\nwas and to add \xe2\x80\x98I know that you are at the bottom of this affair.\xe2\x80\x99  It\r\nmust have seemed miraculous to him that we should know already, but he\r\ntook it all in the stride.  The wonderfulness of it never checked him for\r\na moment.  There remained for me only to put to him the two questions:\r\nWho put you up to it? and Who was the man who did it?  He answered the\r\nfirst with remarkable emphasis.  As to the second question, I gather that\r\nthe fellow with the bomb was his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x94quite a lad\xe2\x80\x94a weak-minded\r\ncreature. . . . It is rather a curious affair\xe2\x80\x94too long perhaps to state\r\nfully just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then have you learned?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the great man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that the ex-convict Michaelis had nothing to do with\r\nit, though indeed the lad had been living with him temporarily in the\r\ncountry up to eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning.  It is more than likely that\r\nMichaelis knows nothing of it to this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are positive as to that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the great man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite certain, Sir Ethelred.  This fellow Verloc went there this\r\nmorning, and took away the lad on the pretence of going out for a walk in\r\nthe lanes.  As it was not the first time that he did this, Michaelis\r\ncould not have the slightest suspicion of anything unusual.  For the\r\nrest, Sir Ethelred, the indignation of this man Verloc had left nothing\r\nin doubt\xe2\x80\x94nothing whatever.  He had been driven out of his mind almost by\r\nan extraordinary performance, which for you or me it would be difficult\r\nto take as seriously meant, but which produced a great impression\r\nobviously on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner then imparted briefly to the great man, who\r\nsat still, resting his eyes under the screen of his hand, Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappreciation of Mr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings and character.  The Assistant\r\nCommissioner did not seem to refuse it a certain amount of competency.\r\nBut the great personage remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this seems very fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?  One would think a ferocious joke.  But our man took it\r\nseriously, it appears.  He felt himself threatened.  In the time, you\r\nknow, he was in direct communication with old Stott-Wartenheim himself,\r\nand had come to regard his services as indispensable.  It was an\r\nextremely rude awakening.  I imagine that he lost his head.  He became\r\nangry and frightened.  Upon my word, my impression is that he thought\r\nthese Embassy people quite capable not only to throw him out but, to give\r\nhim away too in some manner or other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long were you with him,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Presence from behind his\r\nbig hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome forty minutes, Sir Ethelred, in a house of bad repute called\r\nContinental Hotel, closeted in a room which by-the-by I took for the\r\nnight.  I found him under the influence of that reaction which follows\r\nthe effort of crime.  The man cannot be defined as a hardened criminal.\r\nIt is obvious that he did not plan the death of that wretched lad\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nbrother-in-law.  That was a shock to him\xe2\x80\x94I could see that.  Perhaps he is\r\na man of strong sensibilities.  Perhaps he was even fond of the lad\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nknows?  He might have hoped that the fellow would get clear away; in\r\nwhich case it would have been almost impossible to bring this thing home\r\nto anyone.  At any rate he risked consciously nothing more but arrest for\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner paused in his speculations to reflect for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough how, in that last case, he could hope to have his own share in\r\nthe business concealed is more than I can tell,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, in his\r\nignorance of poor Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s devotion to Mr Verloc (who was _good_), and of\r\nhis truly peculiar dumbness, which in the old affair of fireworks on the\r\nstairs had for many years resisted entreaties, coaxing, anger, and other\r\nmeans of investigation used by his beloved sister.  For Stevie was loyal.\r\n. . .  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine.  It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that he never thought of that\r\nat all.  It sounds an extravagant way of putting it, Sir Ethelred, but\r\nhis state of dismay suggested to me an impulsive man who, after\r\ncommitting suicide with the notion that it would end all his troubles,\r\nhad discovered that it did nothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner gave this definition in an apologetic voice.\r\nBut in truth there is a sort of lucidity proper to extravagant language,\r\nand the great man was not offended.  A slight jerky movement of the big\r\nbody half lost in the gloom of the green silk shades, of the big head\r\nleaning on the big hand, accompanied an intermittent stifled but powerful\r\nsound.  The great man had laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner answered very readily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs he seemed very anxious to get back to his wife in the shop I let him\r\ngo, Sir Ethelred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did?  But the fellow will disappear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.  Where could he go to?  Moreover, you must\r\nremember that he has got to think of the danger from his comrades too.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s there at his post.  How could he explain leaving it?  But even if\r\nthere were no obstacles to his freedom of action he would do nothing.  At\r\npresent he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough moral energy to take a resolution of any sort.\r\nPermit me also to point out that if I had detained him we would have been\r\ncommitted to a course of action on which I wished to know your precise\r\nintentions first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great personage rose heavily, an imposing shadowy form in the\r\ngreenish gloom of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see the Attorney-General to-night, and will send for you to-morrow\r\nmorning.  Is there anything more you\xe2\x80\x99d wish to tell me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner had stood up also, slender and flexible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not, Sir Ethelred, unless I were to enter into details which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  No details, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great shadowy form seemed to shrink away as if in physical dread of\r\ndetails; then came forward, expanded, enormous, and weighty, offering a\r\nlarge hand.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you say that this man has got a wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Ethelred,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Assistant Commissioner, pressing\r\ndeferentially the extended hand.  \xe2\x80\x9cA genuine wife and a genuinely,\r\nrespectably, marital relation.  He told me that after his interview at\r\nthe Embassy he would have thrown everything up, would have tried to sell\r\nhis shop, and leave the country, only he felt certain that his wife would\r\nnot even hear of going abroad.  Nothing could be more characteristic of\r\nthe respectable bond than that,\xe2\x80\x9d went on, with a touch of grimness, the\r\nAssistant Commissioner, whose own wife too had refused to hear of going\r\nabroad.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes, a genuine wife.  And the victim was a genuine\r\nbrother-in-law.  From a certain point of view we are here in the presence\r\nof a domestic drama.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner laughed a little; but the great man\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\r\nseemed to have wandered far away, perhaps to the questions of his\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s domestic policy, the battle-ground of his crusading valour\r\nagainst the paynim Cheeseman.  The Assistant Commissioner withdrew\r\nquietly, unnoticed, as if already forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe had his own crusading instincts.  This affair, which, in one way or\r\nanother, disgusted Chief Inspector Heat, seemed to him a providentially\r\ngiven starting-point for a crusade.  He had it much at heart to begin.\r\nHe walked slowly home, meditating that enterprise on the way, and\r\nthinking over Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s psychology in a composite mood of repugnance\r\nand satisfaction.  He walked all the way home.  Finding the drawing-room\r\ndark, he went upstairs, and spent some time between the bedroom and the\r\ndressing-room, changing his clothes, going to and fro with the air of a\r\nthoughtful somnambulist.  But he shook it off before going out again to\r\njoin his wife at the house of the great lady patroness of Michaelis.\r\n\r\nHe knew he would be welcomed there.  On entering the smaller of the two\r\ndrawing-rooms he saw his wife in a small group near the piano.  A\r\nyoungish composer in pass of becoming famous was discoursing from a music\r\nstool to two thick men whose backs looked old, and three slender women\r\nwhose backs looked young.  Behind the screen the great lady had only two\r\npersons with her: a man and a woman, who sat side by side on arm-chairs\r\nat the foot of her couch.  She extended her hand to the Assistant\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never hoped to see you here to-night.  Annie told me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  I had no idea myself that my work would be over so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner added in a low tone: \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to tell you\r\nthat Michaelis is altogether clear of this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe patroness of the ex-convict received this assurance indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?  Were your people stupid enough to connect him with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Assistant Commissioner, contradicting\r\ndeferentially.  \xe2\x80\x9cClever enough\xe2\x80\x94quite clever enough for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA silence fell.  The man at the foot of the couch had stopped speaking to\r\nthe lady, and looked on with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you ever met before,\xe2\x80\x9d said the great lady.\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir and the Assistant Commissioner, introduced, acknowledged each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s existence with punctilious and guarded courtesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been frightening me,\xe2\x80\x9d declared suddenly the lady who sat by the\r\nside of Mr Vladimir, with an inclination of the head towards that\r\ngentleman.  The Assistant Commissioner knew the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not look frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d he pronounced, after surveying her\r\nconscientiously with his tired and equable gaze.  He was thinking\r\nmeantime to himself that in this house one met everybody sooner or later.\r\nMr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s rosy countenance was wreathed in smiles, because he was\r\nwitty, but his eyes remained serious, like the eyes of convinced man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he tried to at least,\xe2\x80\x9d amended the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForce of habit perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Assistant Commissioner, moved by an\r\nirresistible inspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been threatening society with all sorts of horrors,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nthe lady, whose enunciation was caressing and slow, \xe2\x80\x9capropos of this\r\nexplosion in Greenwich Park.  It appears we all ought to quake in our\r\nshoes at what\xe2\x80\x99s coming if those people are not suppressed all over the\r\nworld.  I had no idea this was such a grave affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir, affecting not to listen, leaned towards the couch, talking\r\namiably in subdued tones, but he heard the Assistant Commissioner say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt that Mr Vladimir has a very precise notion of the true\r\nimportance of this affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir asked himself what that confounded and intrusive policeman\r\nwas driving at.  Descended from generations victimised by the instruments\r\nof an arbitrary power, he was racially, nationally, and individually\r\nafraid of the police.  It was an inherited weakness, altogether\r\nindependent of his judgment, of his reason, of his experience.  He was\r\nborn to it.  But that sentiment, which resembled the irrational horror\r\nsome people have of cats, did not stand in the way of his immense\r\ncontempt for the English police.  He finished the sentence addressed to\r\nthe great lady, and turned slightly in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that we have a great experience of these people.  Yes; indeed,\r\nwe suffer greatly from their activity, while you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mr Vladimir hesitated\r\nfor a moment, in smiling perplexity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhile you suffer their presence\r\ngladly in your midst,\xe2\x80\x9d he finished, displaying a dimple on each\r\nclean-shaven cheek.  Then he added more gravely: \xe2\x80\x9cI may even say\xe2\x80\x94because\r\nyou do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Vladimir ceased speaking the Assistant Commissioner lowered his\r\nglance, and the conversation dropped.  Almost immediately afterwards Mr\r\nVladimir took leave.\r\n\r\nDirectly his back was turned on the couch the Assistant Commissioner rose\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were going to stay and take Annie home,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady\r\npatroness of Michaelis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find that I\xe2\x80\x99ve yet a little work to do to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn connection\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes\xe2\x80\x94in a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, what is it really\xe2\x80\x94this horror?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say what it is, but it may yet be a _cause c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bre_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Assistant Commissioner.\r\n\r\nHe left the drawing-room hurriedly, and found Mr Vladimir still in the\r\nhall, wrapping up his throat carefully in a large silk handkerchief.\r\nBehind him a footman waited, holding his overcoat.  Another stood ready\r\nto open the door.  The Assistant Commissioner was duly helped into his\r\ncoat, and let out at once.  After descending the front steps he stopped,\r\nas if to consider the way he should take.  On seeing this through the\r\ndoor held open, Mr Vladimir lingered in the hall to get out a cigar and\r\nasked for a light.  It was furnished to him by an elderly man out of\r\nlivery with an air of calm solicitude.  But the match went out; the\r\nfootman then closed the door, and Mr Vladimir lighted his large Havana\r\nwith leisurely care.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he got out of the house, he saw with disgust the \xe2\x80\x9cconfounded\r\npoliceman\xe2\x80\x9d still standing on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan he be waiting for me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mr Vladimir, looking up and down for\r\nsome signs of a hansom.  He saw none.  A couple of carriages waited by\r\nthe curbstone, their lamps blazing steadily, the horses standing\r\nperfectly still, as if carved in stone, the coachmen sitting motionless\r\nunder the big fur capes, without as much as a quiver stirring the white\r\nthongs of their big whips.  Mr Vladimir walked on, and the \xe2\x80\x9cconfounded\r\npoliceman\xe2\x80\x9d fell into step at his elbow.  He said nothing.  At the end of\r\nthe fourth stride Mr Vladimir felt infuriated and uneasy.  This could not\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRotten weather,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled savagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMild,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Assistant Commissioner without passion.  He remained\r\nsilent for a little while.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got hold of a man called Verloc,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nannounced casually.\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir did not stumble, did not stagger back, did not change his\r\nstride.  But he could not prevent himself from exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d  The\r\nAssistant Commissioner did not repeat his statement.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou know him,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on in the same tone.\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir stopped, and became guttural.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t.  It\xe2\x80\x99s Verloc who says that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lying dog of some sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Vladimir in somewhat Oriental\r\nphraseology.  But in his heart he was almost awed by the miraculous\r\ncleverness of the English police.  The change of his opinion on the\r\nsubject was so violent that it made him for a moment feel slightly sick.\r\nHe threw away his cigar, and moved on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat pleased me most in this affair,\xe2\x80\x9d the Assistant went on, talking\r\nslowly, \xe2\x80\x9cis that it makes such an excellent starting-point for a piece of\r\nwork which I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt must be taken in hand\xe2\x80\x94that is, the clearing out of\r\nthis country of all the foreign political spies, police, and that sort\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94dogs.  In my opinion they are a ghastly nuisance; also an element\r\nof danger.  But we can\xe2\x80\x99t very well seek them out individually.  The only\r\nway is to make their employment unpleasant to their employers.  The\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99s becoming indecent.  And dangerous too, for us, here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir stopped again for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prosecution of this Verloc will demonstrate to the public both the\r\ndanger and the indecency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody will believe what a man of that sort says,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Vladimir\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wealth and precision of detail will carry conviction to the great\r\nmass of the public,\xe2\x80\x9d advanced the Assistant Commissioner gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that is seriously what you mean to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got the man; we have no choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be only feeding up the lying spirit of these revolutionary\r\nscoundrels,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir protested.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to make a scandal\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x94from morality\xe2\x80\x94or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety was obvious.  The Assistant Commissioner having\r\nascertained in this way that there must be some truth in the summary\r\nstatements of Mr Verloc, said indifferently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a practical side too.  We have really enough to do to look after\r\nthe genuine article.  You can\xe2\x80\x99t say we are not effective.  But we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nintend to let ourselves be bothered by shams under any pretext whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s tone became lofty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I can\xe2\x80\x99t share your view.  It is selfish.  My sentiments for\r\nmy own country cannot be doubted; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt that we ought to\r\nbe good Europeans besides\xe2\x80\x94I mean governments and men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Assistant Commissioner simply.  \xe2\x80\x9cOnly you look at Europe\r\nfrom its other end.  But,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in a good-natured tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nforeign governments cannot complain of the inefficiency of our police.\r\nLook at this outrage; a case specially difficult to trace inasmuch as it\r\nwas a sham.  In less than twelve hours we have established the identity\r\nof a man literally blown to shreds, have found the organiser of the\r\nattempt, and have had a glimpse of the inciter behind him.  And we could\r\nhave gone further; only we stopped at the limits of our territory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this instructive crime was planned abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Vladimir said quickly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou admit it was planned abroad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheoretically.  Theoretically only, on foreign territory; abroad only by\r\na fiction,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Assistant Commissioner, alluding to the character of\r\nEmbassies, which are supposed to be part and parcel of the country to\r\nwhich they belong.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s a detail.  I talked to you of this\r\nbusiness because it\xe2\x80\x99s your government that grumbles most at our police.\r\nYou see that we are not so bad.  I wanted particularly to tell you of our\r\nsuccess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mr Vladimir through his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can put our finger on every anarchist here,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the Assistant\r\nCommissioner, as though he were quoting Chief Inspector Heat.  \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s wanted now is to do away with the agent provocateur to make\r\neverything safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Vladimir held up his hand to a passing hansom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going in here,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Assistant Commissioner, looking\r\nat a building of noble proportions and hospitable aspect, with the light\r\nof a great hall falling through its glass doors on a broad flight of\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Vladimir, sitting, stony-eyed, inside the hansom, drove off\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Commissioner himself did not turn into the noble building.\r\nIt was the Explorers\xe2\x80\x99 Club.  The thought passed through his mind that Mr\r\nVladimir, honorary member, would not be seen very often there in the\r\nfuture.  He looked at his watch.  It was only half-past ten.  He had had\r\na very full evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Chief Inspector Heat had left him Mr Verloc moved about the\r\nparlour.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time he eyed his wife through the open door.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe knows all\r\nabout it now,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself with commiseration for her sorrow\r\nand with some satisfaction as regarded himself.  Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s soul, if\r\nlacking greatness perhaps, was capable of tender sentiments.  The\r\nprospect of having to break the news to her had put him into a fever.\r\nChief Inspector Heat had relieved him of the task.  That was good as far\r\nas it went.  It remained for him now to face her grief.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc had never expected to have to face it on account of death,\r\nwhose catastrophic character cannot be argued away by sophisticated\r\nreasoning or persuasive eloquence.  Mr Verloc never meant Stevie to\r\nperish with such abrupt violence.  He did not mean him to perish at all.\r\nStevie dead was a much greater nuisance than ever he had been when alive.\r\nMr Verloc had augured a favourable issue to his enterprise, basing\r\nhimself not on Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence, which sometimes plays queer tricks\r\nwith a man, but on the blind docility and on the blind devotion of the\r\nboy.  Though not much of a psychologist, Mr Verloc had gauged the depth\r\nof Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s fanaticism.  He dared cherish the hope of Stevie walking away\r\nfrom the walls of the Observatory as he had been instructed to do, taking\r\nthe way shown to him several times previously, and rejoining his\r\nbrother-in-law, the wise and good Mr Verloc, outside the precincts of the\r\npark.  Fifteen minutes ought to have been enough for the veriest fool to\r\ndeposit the engine and walk away.  And the Professor had guaranteed more\r\nthan fifteen minutes.  But Stevie had stumbled within five minutes of\r\nbeing left to himself.  And Mr Verloc was shaken morally to pieces.  He\r\nhad foreseen everything but that.  He had foreseen Stevie distracted and\r\nlost\xe2\x80\x94sought for\xe2\x80\x94found in some police station or provincial workhouse in\r\nthe end.  He had foreseen Stevie arrested, and was not afraid, because Mr\r\nVerloc had a great opinion of Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty, which had been carefully\r\nindoctrinated with the necessity of silence in the course of many walks.\r\nLike a peripatetic philosopher, Mr Verloc, strolling along the streets of\r\nLondon, had modified Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s view of the police by conversations full of\r\nsubtle reasonings.  Never had a sage a more attentive and admiring\r\ndisciple.  The submission and worship were so apparent that Mr Verloc had\r\ncome to feel something like a liking for the boy.  In any case, he had\r\nnot foreseen the swift bringing home of his connection.  That his wife\r\nshould hit upon the precaution of sewing the boy\xe2\x80\x99s address inside his\r\novercoat was the last thing Mr Verloc would have thought of.  One can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of everything.  That was what she meant when she said that he need\r\nnot worry if he lost Stevie during their walks.  She had assured him that\r\nthe boy would turn up all right.  Well, he had turned up with a\r\nvengeance!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mr Verloc in his wonder.  What did she mean by it?\r\nSpare him the trouble of keeping an anxious eye on Stevie?  Most likely\r\nshe had meant well.  Only she ought to have told him of the precaution\r\nshe had taken.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc walked behind the counter of the shop.  His intention was not\r\nto overwhelm his wife with bitter reproaches.  Mr Verloc felt no\r\nbitterness.  The unexpected march of events had converted him to the\r\ndoctrine of fatalism.  Nothing could be helped now.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean any harm to come to the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc shuddered at the sound of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s voice.  She did not\r\nuncover her face.  The trusted secret agent of the late Baron\r\nStott-Wartenheim looked at her for a time with a heavy, persistent,\r\nundiscerning glance.  The torn evening paper was lying at her feet.  It\r\ncould not have told her much.  Mr Verloc felt the need of talking to his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s that damned Heat\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe upset you.  He\xe2\x80\x99s a brute,\r\nblurting it out like this to a woman.  I made myself ill thinking how to\r\nbreak it to you.  I sat for hours in the little parlour of Cheshire\r\nCheese thinking over the best way.  You understand I never meant any harm\r\nto come to that boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, the Secret Agent, was speaking the truth.  It was his marital\r\naffection that had received the greatest shock from the premature\r\nexplosion.  He added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel particularly gay sitting there and thinking of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe observed another slight shudder of his wife, which affected his\r\nsensibility.  As she persisted in hiding her face in her hands, he\r\nthought he had better leave her alone for a while.  On this delicate\r\nimpulse Mr Verloc withdrew into the parlour again, where the gas jet\r\npurred like a contented cat.  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s wifely forethought had left\r\nthe cold beef on the table with carving knife and fork and half a loaf of\r\nbread for Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s supper.  He noticed all these things now for the\r\nfirst time, and cutting himself a piece of bread and meat, began to eat.\r\n\r\nHis appetite did not proceed from callousness.  Mr Verloc had not eaten\r\nany breakfast that day.  He had left his home fasting.  Not being an\r\nenergetic man, he found his resolution in nervous excitement, which\r\nseemed to hold him mainly by the throat.  He could not have swallowed\r\nanything solid.  Michaelis\xe2\x80\x99 cottage was as destitute of provisions as the\r\ncell of a prisoner.  The ticket-of-leave apostle lived on a little milk\r\nand crusts of stale bread.  Moreover, when Mr Verloc arrived he had\r\nalready gone upstairs after his frugal meal.  Absorbed in the toil and\r\ndelight of literary composition, he had not even answered Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshout up the little staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am taking this young fellow home for a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, in truth, Mr Verloc did not wait for an answer, but had marched out\r\nof the cottage at once, followed by the obedient Stevie.\r\n\r\nNow that all action was over and his fate taken out of his hands with\r\nunexpected swiftness, Mr Verloc felt terribly empty physically.  He\r\ncarved the meat, cut the bread, and devoured his supper standing by the\r\ntable, and now and then casting a glance towards his wife.  Her prolonged\r\nimmobility disturbed the comfort of his refection.  He walked again into\r\nthe shop, and came up very close to her.  This sorrow with a veiled face\r\nmade Mr Verloc uneasy.  He expected, of course, his wife to be very much\r\nupset, but he wanted her to pull herself together.  He needed all her\r\nassistance and all her loyalty in these new conjunctures his fatalism had\r\nalready accepted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a tone of gloomy sympathy.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Winnie,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to think of to-morrow.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll want all your wits about you\r\nafter I am taken away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused.  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s breast heaved convulsively.  This was not\r\nreassuring to Mr Verloc, in whose view the newly created situation\r\nrequired from the two people most concerned in it calmness, decision, and\r\nother qualities incompatible with the mental disorder of passionate\r\nsorrow.  Mr Verloc was a humane man; he had come home prepared to allow\r\nevery latitude to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s affection for her brother.\r\n\r\nOnly he did not understand either the nature or the whole extent of that\r\nsentiment.  And in this he was excusable, since it was impossible for him\r\nto understand it without ceasing to be himself.  He was startled and\r\ndisappointed, and his speech conveyed it by a certain roughness of tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might look at a fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed after waiting a while.\r\n\r\nAs if forced through the hands covering Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s face the answer\r\ncame, deadened, almost pitiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look at you as long as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh?  What!\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr Verloc was merely startled by the superficial and\r\nliteral meaning of this declaration.  It was obviously unreasonable, the\r\nmere cry of exaggerated grief.  He threw over it the mantle of his\r\nmarital indulgence.  The mind of Mr Verloc lacked profundity.  Under the\r\nmistaken impression that the value of individuals consists in what they\r\nare in themselves, he could not possibly comprehend the value of Stevie\r\nin the eyes of Mrs Verloc.  She was taking it confoundedly hard, he\r\nthought to himself.  It was all the fault of that damned Heat.  What did\r\nhe want to upset the woman for?  But she mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed, for her own\r\ngood, to carry on so till she got quite beside herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here!  You can\xe2\x80\x99t sit like this in the shop,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with affected\r\nseverity, in which there was some real annoyance; for urgent practical\r\nmatters must be talked over if they had to sit up all night.  \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody\r\nmight come in at any minute,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, and waited again.  No effect was\r\nproduced, and the idea of the finality of death occurred to Mr Verloc\r\nduring the pause.  He changed his tone.  \xe2\x80\x9cCome.  This won\xe2\x80\x99t bring him\r\nback,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently, feeling ready to take her in his arms and press\r\nher to his breast, where impatience and compassion dwelt side by side.\r\nBut except for a short shudder Mrs Verloc remained apparently unaffected\r\nby the force of that terrible truism.  It was Mr Verloc himself who was\r\nmoved.  He was moved in his simplicity to urge moderation by asserting\r\nthe claims of his own personality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo be reasonable, Winnie.  What would it have been if you had lost me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had vaguely expected to hear her cry out.  But she did not budge.  She\r\nleaned back a little, quieted down to a complete unreadable stillness.\r\nMr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to beat faster with exasperation and something\r\nresembling alarm.  He laid his hand on her shoulder, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool, Winnie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave no sign.  It was impossible to talk to any purpose with a woman\r\nwhose face one cannot see.  Mr Verloc caught hold of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s wrists.\r\nBut her hands seemed glued fast.  She swayed forward bodily to his tug,\r\nand nearly went off the chair.  Startled to feel her so helplessly limp,\r\nhe was trying to put her back on the chair when she stiffened suddenly\r\nall over, tore herself out of his hands, ran out of the shop, across the\r\nparlour, and into the kitchen.  This was very swift.  He had just a\r\nglimpse of her face and that much of her eyes that he knew she had not\r\nlooked at him.\r\n\r\nIt all had the appearance of a struggle for the possession of a chair,\r\nbecause Mr Verloc instantly took his wife\xe2\x80\x99s place in it.  Mr Verloc did\r\nnot cover his face with his hands, but a sombre thoughtfulness veiled his\r\nfeatures.  A term of imprisonment could not be avoided.  He did not wish\r\nnow to avoid it.  A prison was a place as safe from certain unlawful\r\nvengeances as the grave, with this advantage, that in a prison there is\r\nroom for hope.  What he saw before him was a term of imprisonment, an\r\nearly release and then life abroad somewhere, such as he had contemplated\r\nalready, in case of failure.  Well, it was a failure, if not exactly the\r\nsort of failure he had feared.  It had been so near success that he could\r\nhave positively terrified Mr Vladimir out of his ferocious scoffing with\r\nthis proof of occult efficiency.  So at least it seemed now to Mr Verloc.\r\nHis prestige with the Embassy would have been immense if\xe2\x80\x94if his wife had\r\nnot had the unlucky notion of sewing on the address inside Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\novercoat.  Mr Verloc, who was no fool, had soon perceived the\r\nextraordinary character of the influence he had over Stevie, though he\r\ndid not understand exactly its origin\xe2\x80\x94the doctrine of his supreme wisdom\r\nand goodness inculcated by two anxious women.  In all the eventualities\r\nhe had foreseen Mr Verloc had calculated with correct insight on Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstinctive loyalty and blind discretion.  The eventuality he had not\r\nforeseen had appalled him as a humane man and a fond husband.  From every\r\nother point of view it was rather advantageous.  Nothing can equal the\r\neverlasting discretion of death.  Mr Verloc, sitting perplexed and\r\nfrightened in the small parlour of the Cheshire Cheese, could not help\r\nacknowledging that to himself, because his sensibility did not stand in\r\nthe way of his judgment.  Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s violent disintegration, however\r\ndisturbing to think about, only assured the success; for, of course, the\r\nknocking down of a wall was not the aim of Mr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s menaces, but the\r\nproduction of a moral effect.  With much trouble and distress on Mr\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s part the effect might be said to have been produced.  When,\r\nhowever, most unexpectedly, it came home to roost in Brett Street, Mr\r\nVerloc, who had been struggling like a man in a nightmare for the\r\npreservation of his position, accepted the blow in the spirit of a\r\nconvinced fatalist.  The position was gone through no one\xe2\x80\x99s fault really.\r\nA small, tiny fact had done it.  It was like slipping on a bit of orange\r\npeel in the dark and breaking your leg.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc drew a weary breath.  He nourished no resentment against his\r\nwife.  He thought: She will have to look after the shop while they keep\r\nme locked up.  And thinking also how cruelly she would miss Stevie at\r\nfirst, he felt greatly concerned about her health and spirits.  How would\r\nshe stand her solitude\xe2\x80\x94absolutely alone in that house?  It would not do\r\nfor her to break down while he was locked up?  What would become of the\r\nshop then?  The shop was an asset.  Though Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s fatalism accepted\r\nhis undoing as a secret agent, he had no mind to be utterly ruined,\r\nmostly, it must be owned, from regard for his wife.\r\n\r\nSilent, and out of his line of sight in the kitchen, she frightened him.\r\nIf only she had had her mother with her.  But that silly old woman\xe2\x80\x94An\r\nangry dismay possessed Mr Verloc.  He must talk with his wife.  He could\r\ntell her certainly that a man does get desperate under certain\r\ncircumstances.  But he did not go incontinently to impart to her that\r\ninformation.  First of all, it was clear to him that this evening was no\r\ntime for business.  He got up to close the street door and put the gas\r\nout in the shop.\r\n\r\nHaving thus assured a solitude around his hearthstone Mr Verloc walked\r\ninto the parlour, and glanced down into the kitchen.  Mrs Verloc was\r\nsitting in the place where poor Stevie usually established himself of an\r\nevening with paper and pencil for the pastime of drawing these\r\ncoruscations of innumerable circles suggesting chaos and eternity.  Her\r\narms were folded on the table, and her head was lying on her arms.  Mr\r\nVerloc contemplated her back and the arrangement of her hair for a time,\r\nthen walked away from the kitchen door.  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s philosophical,\r\nalmost disdainful incuriosity, the foundation of their accord in domestic\r\nlife made it extremely difficult to get into contact with her, now this\r\ntragic necessity had arisen.  Mr Verloc felt this difficulty acutely.  He\r\nturned around the table in the parlour with his usual air of a large\r\nanimal in a cage.\r\n\r\nCuriosity being one of the forms of self-revelation, a systematically\r\nincurious person remains always partly mysterious.  Every time he passed\r\nnear the door Mr Verloc glanced at his wife uneasily.  It was not that he\r\nwas afraid of her.  Mr Verloc imagined himself loved by that woman.  But\r\nshe had not accustomed him to make confidences.  And the confidence he\r\nhad to make was of a profound psychological order.  How with his want of\r\npractice could he tell her what he himself felt but vaguely: that there\r\nare conspiracies of fatal destiny, that a notion grows in a mind\r\nsometimes till it acquires an outward existence, an independent power of\r\nits own, and even a suggestive voice?  He could not inform her that a man\r\nmay be haunted by a fat, witty, clean-shaved face till the wildest\r\nexpedient to get rid of it appears a child of wisdom.\r\n\r\nOn this mental reference to a First Secretary of a great Embassy, Mr\r\nVerloc stopped in the doorway, and looking down into the kitchen with an\r\nangry face and clenched fists, addressed his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a brute I had to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started off to make another perambulation of the table; then when he\r\nhad come to the door again he stopped, glaring in from the height of two\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA silly, jeering, dangerous brute, with no more sense than\xe2\x80\x94After all\r\nthese years!  A man like me!  And I have been playing my head at that\r\ngame.  You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.  Quite right, too.  What was the good of telling\r\nyou that I stood the risk of having a knife stuck into me any time these\r\nseven years we\xe2\x80\x99ve been married?  I am not a chap to worry a woman that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfond of me.  You had no business to know.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr Verloc took another turn\r\nround the parlour, fuming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA venomous beast,\xe2\x80\x9d he began again from the doorway.  \xe2\x80\x9cDrive me out into\r\na ditch to starve for a joke.  I could see he thought it was a damned\r\ngood joke.  A man like me!  Look here!  Some of the highest in the world\r\ngot to thank me for walking on their two legs to this day.  That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nman you\xe2\x80\x99ve got married to, my girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe perceived that his wife had sat up.  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s arms remained lying\r\nstretched on the table.  Mr Verloc watched at her back as if he could\r\nread there the effect of his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a murdering plot for the last eleven years that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\nfinger in at the risk of my life.  There\xe2\x80\x99s scores of these revolutionists\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve sent off, with their bombs in their blamed pockets, to get\r\nthemselves caught on the frontier.  The old Baron knew what I was worth\r\nto his country.  And here suddenly a swine comes along\xe2\x80\x94an ignorant,\r\noverbearing swine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, stepping slowly down two steps, entered the kitchen, took a\r\ntumbler off the dresser, and holding it in his hand, approached the sink,\r\nwithout looking at his wife.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the old Baron who would have had\r\nthe wicked folly of getting me to call on him at eleven in the morning.\r\nThere are two or three in this town that, if they had seen me going in,\r\nwould have made no bones about knocking me on the head sooner or later.\r\nIt was a silly, murderous trick to expose for nothing a man\xe2\x80\x94like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, turning on the tap above the sink, poured three glasses of\r\nwater, one after another, down his throat to quench the fires of his\r\nindignation.  Mr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was like a hot brand which set his\r\ninternal economy in a blaze.  He could not get over the disloyalty of it.\r\nThis man, who would not work at the usual hard tasks which society sets\r\nto its humbler members, had exercised his secret industry with an\r\nindefatigable devotion.  There was in Mr Verloc a fund of loyalty.  He\r\nhad been loyal to his employers, to the cause of social stability,\xe2\x80\x94and to\r\nhis affections too\xe2\x80\x94as became apparent when, after standing the tumbler in\r\nthe sink, he turned about, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of you I would have taken the bullying brute by the\r\nthroat and rammed his head into the fireplace.  I\xe2\x80\x99d have been more than a\r\nmatch for that pink-faced, smooth-shaved\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, neglected to finish the sentence, as if there could be no\r\ndoubt of the terminal word.  For the first time in his life he was taking\r\nthat incurious woman into his confidence.  The singularity of the event,\r\nthe force and importance of the personal feelings aroused in the course\r\nof this confession, drove Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s fate clean out of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s stuttering existence of fears and indignations, together with\r\nthe violence of his end, had passed out of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mental sight for a\r\ntime.  For that reason, when he looked up he was startled by the\r\ninappropriate character of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s stare.  It was not a wild stare,\r\nand it was not inattentive, but its attention was peculiar and not\r\nsatisfactory, inasmuch that it seemed concentrated upon some point beyond\r\nMr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s person.  The impression was so strong that Mr Verloc glanced\r\nover his shoulder.  There was nothing behind him: there was just the\r\nwhitewashed wall.  The excellent husband of Winnie Verloc saw no writing\r\non the wall.  He turned to his wife again, repeating, with some emphasis:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have taken him by the throat.  As true as I stand here, if I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of you then I would have half choked the life out of the\r\nbrute before I let him get up.  And don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he would have been\r\nanxious to call the police either.  He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have dared.  You\r\nunderstand why\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe blinked at his wife knowingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Verloc in an unresonant voice, and without looking at him\r\nat all.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA great discouragement, the result of fatigue, came upon Mr Verloc.  He\r\nhad had a very full day, and his nerves had been tried to the utmost.\r\nAfter a month of maddening worry, ending in an unexpected catastrophe,\r\nthe storm-tossed spirit of Mr Verloc longed for repose.  His career as a\r\nsecret agent had come to an end in a way no one could have foreseen;\r\nonly, now, perhaps he could manage to get a night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep at last.  But\r\nlooking at his wife, he doubted it.  She was taking it very hard\xe2\x80\x94not at\r\nall like herself, he thought.  He made an effort to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pull yourself together, my girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nsympathetically.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s done can\xe2\x80\x99t be undone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc gave a slight start, though not a muscle of her white face\r\nmoved in the least.  Mr Verloc, who was not looking at her, continued\r\nponderously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go to bed now.  What you want is a good cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis opinion had nothing to recommend it but the general consent of\r\nmankind.  It is universally understood that, as if it were nothing more\r\nsubstantial than vapour floating in the sky, every emotion of a woman is\r\nbound to end in a shower.  And it is very probable that had Stevie died\r\nin his bed under her despairing gaze, in her protecting arms, Mrs\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s grief would have found relief in a flood of bitter and pure\r\ntears.  Mrs Verloc, in common with other human beings, was provided with\r\na fund of unconscious resignation sufficient to meet the normal\r\nmanifestation of human destiny.  Without \xe2\x80\x9ctroubling her head about it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe was aware that it \xe2\x80\x9cdid not stand looking into very much.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the\r\nlamentable circumstances of Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s end, which to Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mind had\r\nonly an episodic character, as part of a greater disaster, dried her\r\ntears at their very source.  It was the effect of a white-hot iron drawn\r\nacross her eyes; at the same time her heart, hardened and chilled into a\r\nlump of ice, kept her body in an inward shudder, set her features into a\r\nfrozen contemplative immobility addressed to a whitewashed wall with no\r\nwriting on it.  The exigencies of Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s temperament, which, when\r\nstripped of its philosophical reserve, was maternal and violent, forced\r\nher to roll a series of thoughts in her motionless head.  These thoughts\r\nwere rather imagined than expressed.  Mrs Verloc was a woman of\r\nsingularly few words, either for public or private use.  With the rage\r\nand dismay of a betrayed woman, she reviewed the tenor of her life in\r\nvisions concerned mostly with Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s difficult existence from its\r\nearliest days.  It was a life of single purpose and of a noble unity of\r\ninspiration, like those rare lives that have left their mark on the\r\nthoughts and feelings of mankind.  But the visions of Mrs Verloc lacked\r\nnobility and magnificence.  She saw herself putting the boy to bed by the\r\nlight of a single candle on the deserted top floor of a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndark under the roof and scintillating exceedingly with lights and cut\r\nglass at the level of the street like a fairy palace.  That meretricious\r\nsplendour was the only one to be met in Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s visions.  She\r\nremembered brushing the boy\xe2\x80\x99s hair and tying his pinafores\xe2\x80\x94herself in a\r\npinafore still; the consolations administered to a small and badly scared\r\ncreature by another creature nearly as small but not quite so badly\r\nscared; she had the vision of the blows intercepted (often with her own\r\nhead), of a door held desperately shut against a man\xe2\x80\x99s rage (not for very\r\nlong); of a poker flung once (not very far), which stilled that\r\nparticular storm into the dumb and awful silence which follows a\r\nthunder-clap.  And all these scenes of violence came and went accompanied\r\nby the unrefined noise of deep vociferations proceeding from a man\r\nwounded in his paternal pride, declaring himself obviously accursed since\r\none of his kids was a \xe2\x80\x9cslobbering idjut and the other a wicked\r\nshe-devil.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was of her that this had been said many years ago.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc heard the words again in a ghostly fashion, and then the\r\ndreary shadow of the Belgravian mansion descended upon her shoulders.  It\r\nwas a crushing memory, an exhausting vision of countless breakfast trays\r\ncarried up and down innumerable stairs, of endless haggling over pence,\r\nof the endless drudgery of sweeping, dusting, cleaning, from basement to\r\nattics; while the impotent mother, staggering on swollen legs, cooked in\r\na grimy kitchen, and poor Stevie, the unconscious presiding genius of all\r\ntheir toil, blacked the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s boots in the scullery.  But this\r\nvision had a breath of a hot London summer in it, and for a central\r\nfigure a young man wearing his Sunday best, with a straw hat on his dark\r\nhead and a wooden pipe in his mouth.  Affectionate and jolly, he was a\r\nfascinating companion for a voyage down the sparkling stream of life;\r\nonly his boat was very small.  There was room in it for a girl-partner at\r\nthe oar, but no accommodation for passengers.  He was allowed to drift\r\naway from the threshold of the Belgravian mansion while Winnie averted\r\nher tearful eyes.  He was not a lodger.  The lodger was Mr Verloc,\r\nindolent, and keeping late hours, sleepily jocular of a morning from\r\nunder his bed-clothes, but with gleams of infatuation in his heavy lidded\r\neyes, and always with some money in his pockets.  There was no sparkle of\r\nany kind on the lazy stream of his life.  It flowed through secret\r\nplaces.  But his barque seemed a roomy craft, and his taciturn\r\nmagnanimity accepted as a matter of course the presence of passengers.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc pursued the visions of seven years\xe2\x80\x99 security for Stevie,\r\nloyally paid for on her part; of security growing into confidence, into a\r\ndomestic feeling, stagnant and deep like a placid pool, whose guarded\r\nsurface hardly shuddered on the occasional passage of Comrade Ossipon,\r\nthe robust anarchist with shamelessly inviting eyes, whose glance had a\r\ncorrupt clearness sufficient to enlighten any woman not absolutely\r\nimbecile.\r\n\r\nA few seconds only had elapsed since the last word had been uttered aloud\r\nin the kitchen, and Mrs Verloc was staring already at the vision of an\r\nepisode not more than a fortnight old.  With eyes whose pupils were\r\nextremely dilated she stared at the vision of her husband and poor Stevie\r\nwalking up Brett Street side by side away from the shop.  It was the last\r\nscene of an existence created by Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s genius; an existence\r\nforeign to all grace and charm, without beauty and almost without\r\ndecency, but admirable in the continuity of feeling and tenacity of\r\npurpose.  And this last vision had such plastic relief, such nearness of\r\nform, such a fidelity of suggestive detail, that it wrung from Mrs Verloc\r\nan anguished and faint murmur, reproducing the supreme illusion of her\r\nlife, an appalled murmur that died out on her blanched lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight have been father and son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc stopped, and raised a care-worn face.  \xe2\x80\x9cEh?  What did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked.  Receiving no reply, he resumed his sinister tramping.  Then\r\nwith a menacing flourish of a thick, fleshy fist, he burst out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  The Embassy people.  A pretty lot, ain\xe2\x80\x99t they!  Before a week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nout I\xe2\x80\x99ll make some of them wish themselves twenty feet underground.  Eh?\r\nWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced sideways, with his head down.  Mrs Verloc gazed at the\r\nwhitewashed wall.  A blank wall\xe2\x80\x94perfectly blank.  A blankness to run at\r\nand dash your head against.  Mrs Verloc remained immovably seated.  She\r\nkept still as the population of half the globe would keep still in\r\nastonishment and despair, were the sun suddenly put out in the summer sky\r\nby the perfidy of a trusted providence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Embassy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Verloc began again, after a preliminary grimace which\r\nbared his teeth wolfishly.  \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could get loose in there with a\r\ncudgel for half-an-hour.  I would keep on hitting till there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nsingle unbroken bone left amongst the whole lot.  But never mind, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nteach them yet what it means trying to throw out a man like me to rot in\r\nthe streets.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve a tongue in my head.  All the world shall know what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve done for them.  I am not afraid.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.  Everything\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nout.  Every damned thing.  Let them look out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn these terms did Mr Verloc declare his thirst for revenge.  It was a\r\nvery appropriate revenge.  It was in harmony with the promptings of Mr\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s genius.  It had also the advantage of being within the range of\r\nhis powers and of adjusting itself easily to the practice of his life,\r\nwhich had consisted precisely in betraying the secret and unlawful\r\nproceedings of his fellow-men.  Anarchists or diplomats were all one to\r\nhim.  Mr Verloc was temperamentally no respecter of persons.  His scorn\r\nwas equally distributed over the whole field of his operations.  But as a\r\nmember of a revolutionary proletariat\xe2\x80\x94which he undoubtedly was\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nnourished a rather inimical sentiment against social distinction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing on earth can stop me now,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, and paused, looking fixedly\r\nat his wife, who was looking fixedly at a blank wall.\r\n\r\nThe silence in the kitchen was prolonged, and Mr Verloc felt\r\ndisappointed.  He had expected his wife to say something.  But Mrs\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s lips, composed in their usual form, preserved a statuesque\r\nimmobility like the rest of her face.  And Mr Verloc was disappointed.\r\nYet the occasion did not, he recognised, demand speech from her.  She was\r\na woman of very few words.  For reasons involved in the very foundation\r\nof his psychology, Mr Verloc was inclined to put his trust in any woman\r\nwho had given herself to him.  Therefore he trusted his wife.  Their\r\naccord was perfect, but it was not precise.  It was a tacit accord,\r\ncongenial to Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s incuriosity and to Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s habits of mind,\r\nwhich were indolent and secret.  They refrained from going to the bottom\r\nof facts and motives.\r\n\r\nThis reserve, expressing, in a way, their profound confidence in each\r\nother, introduced at the same time a certain element of vagueness into\r\ntheir intimacy.  No system of conjugal relations is perfect.  Mr Verloc\r\npresumed that his wife had understood him, but he would have been glad to\r\nhear her say what she thought at the moment.  It would have been a\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons why this comfort was denied him.  There was a\r\nphysical obstacle: Mrs Verloc had no sufficient command over her voice.\r\nShe did not see any alternative between screaming and silence, and\r\ninstinctively she chose the silence.  Winnie Verloc was temperamentally a\r\nsilent person.  And there was the paralysing atrocity of the thought\r\nwhich occupied her.  Her cheeks were blanched, her lips ashy, her\r\nimmobility amazing.  And she thought without looking at Mr Verloc: \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nman took the boy away to murder him.  He took the boy away from his home\r\nto murder him.  He took the boy away from me to murder him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s whole being was racked by that inconclusive and maddening\r\nthought.  It was in her veins, in her bones, in the roots of her hair.\r\nMentally she assumed the biblical attitude of mourning\xe2\x80\x94the covered face,\r\nthe rent garments; the sound of wailing and lamentation filled her head.\r\nBut her teeth were violently clenched, and her tearless eyes were hot\r\nwith rage, because she was not a submissive creature.  The protection she\r\nhad extended over her brother had been in its origin of a fierce and\r\nindignant complexion.  She had to love him with a militant love.  She had\r\nbattled for him\xe2\x80\x94even against herself.  His loss had the bitterness of\r\ndefeat, with the anguish of a baffled passion.  It was not an ordinary\r\nstroke of death.  Moreover, it was not death that took Stevie from her.\r\nIt was Mr Verloc who took him away.  She had seen him.  She had watched\r\nhim, without raising a hand, take the boy away.  And she had let him go,\r\nlike\xe2\x80\x94like a fool\xe2\x80\x94a blind fool.  Then after he had murdered the boy he\r\ncame home to her.  Just came home like any other man would come home to\r\nhis wife. . . .\r\n\r\nThrough her set teeth Mrs Verloc muttered at the wall:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I thought he had caught a cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Verloc heard these words and appropriated them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said moodily.  \xe2\x80\x9cI was upset.  I was upset on your\r\naccount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, turning her head slowly, transferred her stare from the wall\r\nto her husband\xe2\x80\x99s person.  Mr Verloc, with the tips of his fingers between\r\nhis lips, was looking on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled, letting his hand fall.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou must pull\r\nyourself together.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll want all your wits about you.  It is you who\r\nbrought the police about our ears.  Never mind, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything more\r\nabout it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr Verloc magnanimously.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d breathed out Mrs Verloc.  It was as if a corpse had spoken.\r\nMr Verloc took up the thread of his discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll make them sit up.  Once under lock and key it\r\nwill be safe enough for me to talk\xe2\x80\x94you understand.  You must reckon on me\r\nbeing two years away from you,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, in a tone of sincere\r\nconcern.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be easier for you than for me.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll have something\r\nto do, while I\xe2\x80\x94Look here, Winnie, what you must do is to keep this\r\nbusiness going for two years.  You know enough for that.  You\xe2\x80\x99ve a good\r\nhead on you.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you word when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go about trying to\r\nsell.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be extra careful.  The comrades will be keeping an\r\neye on you all the time.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be as artful as you know how,\r\nand as close as the grave.  No one must know what you are going to do.  I\r\nhave no mind to get a knock on the head or a stab in the back directly I\r\nam let out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Mr Verloc, applying his mind with ingenuity and forethought to\r\nthe problems of the future.  His voice was sombre, because he had a\r\ncorrect sentiment of the situation.  Everything which he did not wish to\r\npass had come to pass.  The future had become precarious.  His judgment,\r\nperhaps, had been momentarily obscured by his dread of Mr Vladimir\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntruculent folly.  A man somewhat over forty may be excusably thrown into\r\nconsiderable disorder by the prospect of losing his employment,\r\nespecially if the man is a secret agent of political police, dwelling\r\nsecure in the consciousness of his high value and in the esteem of high\r\npersonages.  He was excusable.\r\n\r\nNow the thing had ended in a crash.  Mr Verloc was cool; but he was not\r\ncheerful.  A secret agent who throws his secrecy to the winds from desire\r\nof vengeance, and flaunts his achievements before the public eye, becomes\r\nthe mark for desperate and bloodthirsty indignations.  Without unduly\r\nexaggerating the danger, Mr Verloc tried to bring it clearly before his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s mind.  He repeated that he had no intention to let the\r\nrevolutionists do away with him.\r\n\r\nHe looked straight into his wife\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.  The enlarged pupils of the\r\nwoman received his stare into their unfathomable depths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too fond of you for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a little nervous laugh.\r\n\r\nA faint flush coloured Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s ghastly and motionless face.  Having\r\ndone with the visions of the past, she had not only heard, but had also\r\nunderstood the words uttered by her husband.  By their extreme disaccord\r\nwith her mental condition these words produced on her a slightly\r\nsuffocating effect.  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition had the merit of\r\nsimplicity; but it was not sound.  It was governed too much by a fixed\r\nidea.  Every nook and cranny of her brain was filled with the thought\r\nthat this man, with whom she had lived without distaste for seven years,\r\nhad taken the \xe2\x80\x9cpoor boy\xe2\x80\x9d away from her in order to kill him\xe2\x80\x94the man to\r\nwhom she had grown accustomed in body and mind; the man whom she had\r\ntrusted, took the boy away to kill him!  In its form, in its substance,\r\nin its effect, which was universal, altering even the aspect of inanimate\r\nthings, it was a thought to sit still and marvel at for ever and ever.\r\nMrs Verloc sat still.  And across that thought (not across the kitchen)\r\nthe form of Mr Verloc went to and fro, familiarly in hat and overcoat,\r\nstamping with his boots upon her brain.  He was probably talking too; but\r\nMrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s thought for the most part covered the voice.\r\n\r\nNow and then, however, the voice would make itself heard.  Several\r\nconnected words emerged at times.  Their purport was generally hopeful.\r\nOn each of these occasions Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s dilated pupils, losing their\r\nfar-off fixity, followed her husband\xe2\x80\x99s movements with the effect of black\r\ncare and impenetrable attention.  Well informed upon all matters relating\r\nto his secret calling, Mr Verloc augured well for the success of his\r\nplans and combinations.  He really believed that it would be upon the\r\nwhole easy for him to escape the knife of infuriated revolutionists.  He\r\nhad exaggerated the strength of their fury and the length of their arm\r\n(for professional purposes) too often to have many illusions one way or\r\nthe other.  For to exaggerate with judgment one must begin by measuring\r\nwith nicety.  He knew also how much virtue and how much infamy is\r\nforgotten in two years\xe2\x80\x94two long years.  His first really confidential\r\ndiscourse to his wife was optimistic from conviction.  He also thought it\r\ngood policy to display all the assurance he could muster.  It would put\r\nheart into the poor woman.  On his liberation, which, harmonising with\r\nthe whole tenor of his life, would be secret, of course, they would\r\nvanish together without loss of time.  As to covering up the tracks, he\r\nbegged his wife to trust him for that.  He knew how it was to be done so\r\nthat the devil himself\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand.  He seemed to boast.  He wished only to put heart into\r\nher.  It was a benevolent intention, but Mr Verloc had the misfortune not\r\nto be in accord with his audience.\r\n\r\nThe self-confident tone grew upon Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s ear which let most of the\r\nwords go by; for what were words to her now?  What could words do to her,\r\nfor good or evil in the face of her fixed idea?  Her black glance\r\nfollowed that man who was asserting his impunity\xe2\x80\x94the man who had taken\r\npoor Stevie from home to kill him somewhere.  Mrs Verloc could not\r\nremember exactly where, but her heart began to beat very perceptibly.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc, in a soft and conjugal tone, was now expressing his firm\r\nbelief that there were yet a good few years of quiet life before them\r\nboth.  He did not go into the question of means.  A quiet life it must be\r\nand, as it were, nestling in the shade, concealed among men whose flesh\r\nis grass; modest, like the life of violets.  The words used by Mr Verloc\r\nwere: \xe2\x80\x9cLie low for a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d  And far from England, of course.  It was not\r\nclear whether Mr Verloc had in his mind Spain or South America; but at\r\nany rate somewhere abroad.\r\n\r\nThis last word, falling into Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s ear, produced a definite\r\nimpression.  This man was talking of going abroad.  The impression was\r\ncompletely disconnected; and such is the force of mental habit that Mrs\r\nVerloc at once and automatically asked herself: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what of Stevie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a sort of forgetfulness; but instantly she became aware that there\r\nwas no longer any occasion for anxiety on that score.  There would never\r\nbe any occasion any more.  The poor boy had been taken out and killed.\r\nThe poor boy was dead.\r\n\r\nThis shaking piece of forgetfulness stimulated Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence.\r\nShe began to perceive certain consequences which would have surprised Mr\r\nVerloc.  There was no need for her now to stay there, in that kitchen, in\r\nthat house, with that man\xe2\x80\x94since the boy was gone for ever.  No need\r\nwhatever.  And on that Mrs Verloc rose as if raised by a spring.  But\r\nneither could she see what there was to keep her in the world at all.\r\nAnd this inability arrested her.  Mr Verloc watched her with marital\r\nsolicitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re looking more like yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said uneasily.  Something\r\npeculiar in the blackness of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s eyes disturbed his optimism.  At\r\nthat precise moment Mrs Verloc began to look upon herself as released\r\nfrom all earthly ties.\r\n\r\nShe had her freedom.  Her contract with existence, as represented by that\r\nman standing over there, was at an end.  She was a free woman.  Had this\r\nview become in some way perceptible to Mr Verloc he would have been\r\nextremely shocked.  In his affairs of the heart Mr Verloc had been always\r\ncarelessly generous, yet always with no other idea than that of being\r\nloved for himself.  Upon this matter, his ethical notions being in\r\nagreement with his vanity, he was completely incorrigible.  That this\r\nshould be so in the case of his virtuous and legal connection he was\r\nperfectly certain.  He had grown older, fatter, heavier, in the belief\r\nthat he lacked no fascination for being loved for his own sake.  When he\r\nsaw Mrs Verloc starting to walk out of the kitchen without a word he was\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to?\xe2\x80\x9d he called out rather sharply.  \xe2\x80\x9cUpstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc in the doorway turned at the voice.  An instinct of prudence\r\nborn of fear, the excessive fear of being approached and touched by that\r\nman, induced her to nod at him slightly (from the height of two steps),\r\nwith a stir of the lips which the conjugal optimism of Mr Verloc took for\r\na wan and uncertain smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d he encouraged her gruffly.  \xe2\x80\x9cRest and quiet\xe2\x80\x99s what you\r\nwant.  Go on.  It won\xe2\x80\x99t be long before I am with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, the free woman who had had really no idea where she was going\r\nto, obeyed the suggestion with rigid steadiness.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc watched her.  She disappeared up the stairs.  He was\r\ndisappointed.  There was that within him which would have been more\r\nsatisfied if she had been moved to throw herself upon his breast.  But he\r\nwas generous and indulgent.  Winnie was always undemonstrative and\r\nsilent.  Neither was Mr Verloc himself prodigal of endearments and words\r\nas a rule.  But this was not an ordinary evening.  It was an occasion\r\nwhen a man wants to be fortified and strengthened by open proofs of\r\nsympathy and affection.  Mr Verloc sighed, and put out the gas in the\r\nkitchen.  Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy with his wife was genuine and intense.  It\r\nalmost brought tears into his eyes as he stood in the parlour reflecting\r\non the loneliness hanging over her head.  In this mood Mr Verloc missed\r\nStevie very much out of a difficult world.  He thought mournfully of his\r\nend.  If only that lad had not stupidly destroyed himself!\r\n\r\nThe sensation of unappeasable hunger, not unknown after the strain of a\r\nhazardous enterprise to adventurers of tougher fibre than Mr Verloc,\r\novercame him again.  The piece of roast beef, laid out in the likeness of\r\nfunereal baked meats for Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s obsequies, offered itself largely to\r\nhis notice.  And Mr Verloc again partook.  He partook ravenously, without\r\nrestraint and decency, cutting thick slices with the sharp carving knife,\r\nand swallowing them without bread.  In the course of that refection it\r\noccurred to Mr Verloc that he was not hearing his wife move about the\r\nbedroom as he should have done.  The thought of finding her perhaps\r\nsitting on the bed in the dark not only cut Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s appetite, but\r\nalso took from him the inclination to follow her upstairs just yet.\r\nLaying down the carving knife, Mr Verloc listened with careworn\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nHe was comforted by hearing her move at last.  She walked suddenly across\r\nthe room, and threw the window up.  After a period of stillness up there,\r\nduring which he figured her to himself with her head out, he heard the\r\nsash being lowered slowly.  Then she made a few steps, and sat down.\r\nEvery resonance of his house was familiar to Mr Verloc, who was\r\nthoroughly domesticated.  When next he heard his wife\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps\r\noverhead he knew, as well as if he had seen her doing it, that she had\r\nbeen putting on her walking shoes.  Mr Verloc wriggled his shoulders\r\nslightly at this ominous symptom, and moving away from the table, stood\r\nwith his back to the fireplace, his head on one side, and gnawing\r\nperplexedly at the tips of his fingers.  He kept track of her movements\r\nby the sound.  She walked here and there violently, with abrupt\r\nstoppages, now before the chest of drawers, then in front of the\r\nwardrobe.  An immense load of weariness, the harvest of a day of shocks\r\nand surprises, weighed Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s energies to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe did not raise his eyes till he heard his wife descending the stairs.\r\nIt was as he had guessed.  She was dressed for going out.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc was a free woman.  She had thrown open the window of the\r\nbedroom either with the intention of screaming Murder!  Help! or of\r\nthrowing herself out.  For she did not exactly know what use to make of\r\nher freedom.  Her personality seemed to have been torn into two pieces,\r\nwhose mental operations did not adjust themselves very well to each\r\nother.  The street, silent and deserted from end to end, repelled her by\r\ntaking sides with that man who was so certain of his impunity.  She was\r\nafraid to shout lest no one should come.  Obviously no one would come.\r\nHer instinct of self-preservation recoiled from the depth of the fall\r\ninto that sort of slimy, deep trench.  Mrs Verloc closed the window, and\r\ndressed herself to go out into the street by another way.  She was a free\r\nwoman.  She had dressed herself thoroughly, down to the tying of a black\r\nveil over her face.  As she appeared before him in the light of the\r\nparlour, Mr Verloc observed that she had even her little handbag hanging\r\nfrom her left wrist. . . . Flying off to her mother, of course.\r\n\r\nThe thought that women were wearisome creatures after all presented\r\nitself to his fatigued brain.  But he was too generous to harbour it for\r\nmore than an instant.  This man, hurt cruelly in his vanity, remained\r\nmagnanimous in his conduct, allowing himself no satisfaction of a bitter\r\nsmile or of a contemptuous gesture.  With true greatness of soul, he only\r\nglanced at the wooden clock on the wall, and said in a perfectly calm but\r\nforcible manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive and twenty minutes past eight, Winnie.  There\xe2\x80\x99s no sense in going\r\nover there so late.  You will never manage to get back to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore his extended hand Mrs Verloc had stopped short.  He added heavily:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother will be gone to bed before you get there.  This is the sort\r\nof news that can wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing was further from Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts than going to her mother.\r\nShe recoiled at the mere idea, and feeling a chair behind her, she obeyed\r\nthe suggestion of the touch, and sat down.  Her intention had been simply\r\nto get outside the door for ever.  And if this feeling was correct, its\r\nmental form took an unrefined shape corresponding to her origin and\r\nstation.  \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather walk the streets all the days of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought.  But this creature, whose moral nature had been subjected to a\r\nshock of which, in the physical order, the most violent earthquake of\r\nhistory could only be a faint and languid rendering, was at the mercy of\r\nmere trifles, of casual contacts.  She sat down.  With her hat and veil\r\nshe had the air of a visitor, of having looked in on Mr Verloc for a\r\nmoment.  Her instant docility encouraged him, whilst her aspect of only\r\ntemporary and silent acquiescence provoked him a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you, Winnie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with authority, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your place is\r\nhere this evening.  Hang it all! you brought the damned police high and\r\nlow about my ears.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s your doing all the same.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d better take this confounded hat off.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you go out, old\r\ngirl,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a softened voice.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s mind got hold of that declaration with morbid tenacity.  The\r\nman who had taken Stevie out from under her very eyes to murder him in a\r\nlocality whose name was at the moment not present to her memory would not\r\nallow her to go out.  Of course he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nNow he had murdered Stevie he would never let her go.  He would want to\r\nkeep her for nothing.  And on this characteristic reasoning, having all\r\nthe force of insane logic, Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s disconnected wits went to work\r\npractically.  She could slip by him, open the door, run out.  But he\r\nwould dash out after her, seize her round the body, drag her back into\r\nthe shop.  She could scratch, kick, and bite\xe2\x80\x94and stab too; but for\r\nstabbing she wanted a knife.  Mrs Verloc sat still under her black veil,\r\nin her own house, like a masked and mysterious visitor of impenetrable\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\nMr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s magnanimity was not more than human.  She had exasperated him\r\nat last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you say something?  You have your own dodges for vexing a man.  Oh\r\nyes!  I know your deaf-and-dumb trick.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you at it before\r\nto-day.  But just now it won\xe2\x80\x99t do.  And to begin with, take this damned\r\nthing off.  One can\xe2\x80\x99t tell whether one is talking to a dummy or to a live\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe advanced, and stretching out his hand, dragged the veil off, unmasking\r\na still, unreadable face, against which his nervous exasperation was\r\nshattered like a glass bubble flung against a rock.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, to cover his momentary uneasiness, and retreated back to his old\r\nstation by the mantelpiece.  It never entered his head that his wife\r\ncould give him up.  He felt a little ashamed of himself, for he was fond\r\nand generous.  What could he do?  Everything had been said already.  He\r\nprotested vehemently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy heavens!  You know that I hunted high and low.  I ran the risk of\r\ngiving myself away to find somebody for that accursed job.  And I tell\r\nyou again I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anyone crazy enough or hungry enough.  What do\r\nyou take me for\xe2\x80\x94a murderer, or what?  The boy is gone.  Do you think I\r\nwanted him to blow himself up?  He\xe2\x80\x99s gone.  His troubles are over.  Ours\r\nare just going to begin, I tell you, precisely because he did blow\r\nhimself.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you.  But just try to understand that it was a\r\npure accident; as much an accident as if he had been run over by a \xe2\x80\x99bus\r\nwhile crossing the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis generosity was not infinite, because he was a human being\xe2\x80\x94and not a\r\nmonster, as Mrs Verloc believed him to be.  He paused, and a snarl\r\nlifting his moustaches above a gleam of white teeth gave him the\r\nexpression of a reflective beast, not very dangerous\xe2\x80\x94a slow beast with a\r\nsleek head, gloomier than a seal, and with a husky voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when it comes to that, it\xe2\x80\x99s as much your doing as mine.  That\xe2\x80\x99s so.\r\nYou may glare as much as you like.  I know what you can do in that way.\r\nStrike me dead if I ever would have thought of the lad for that purpose.\r\nIt was you who kept on shoving him in my way when I was half distracted\r\nwith the worry of keeping the lot of us out of trouble.  What the devil\r\nmade you?  One would think you were doing it on purpose.  And I am damned\r\nif I know that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.  There\xe2\x80\x99s no saying how much of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on\r\nyou have got hold of on the sly with your infernal don\xe2\x80\x99t-care-a-damn way\r\nof looking nowhere in particular, and saying nothing at all. . . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis husky domestic voice ceased for a while.  Mrs Verloc made no reply.\r\nBefore that silence he felt ashamed of what he had said.  But as often\r\nhappens to peaceful men in domestic tiffs, being ashamed he pushed\r\nanother point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a devilish way of holding your tongue sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d he began\r\nagain, without raising his voice.  \xe2\x80\x9cEnough to make some men go mad.  It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlucky for you that I am not so easily put out as some of them would be by\r\nyour deaf-and-dumb sulks.  I am fond of you.  But don\xe2\x80\x99t you go too far.\r\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the time for it.  We ought to be thinking of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\ndo.  And I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you go out to-night, galloping off to your mother\r\nwith some crazy tale or other about me.  I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you make\r\nany mistake about it: if you will have it that I killed the boy, then\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve killed him as much as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn sincerity of feeling and openness of statement, these words went far\r\nbeyond anything that had ever been said in this home, kept up on the\r\nwages of a secret industry eked out by the sale of more or less secret\r\nwares: the poor expedients devised by a mediocre mankind for preserving\r\nan imperfect society from the dangers of moral and physical corruption,\r\nboth secret too of their kind.  They were spoken because Mr Verloc had\r\nfelt himself really outraged; but the reticent decencies of this home\r\nlife, nestling in a shady street behind a shop where the sun never shone,\r\nremained apparently undisturbed.  Mrs Verloc heard him out with perfect\r\npropriety, and then rose from her chair in her hat and jacket like a\r\nvisitor at the end of a call.  She advanced towards her husband, one arm\r\nextended as if for a silent leave-taking.  Her net veil dangling down by\r\none end on the left side of her face gave an air of disorderly formality\r\nto her restrained movements.  But when she arrived as far as the\r\nhearthrug, Mr Verloc was no longer standing there.  He had moved off in\r\nthe direction of the sofa, without raising his eyes to watch the effect\r\nof his tirade.  He was tired, resigned in a truly marital spirit.  But he\r\nfelt hurt in the tender spot of his secret weakness.  If she would go on\r\nsulking in that dreadful overcharged silence\xe2\x80\x94why then she must.  She was\r\na master in that domestic art.  Mr Verloc flung himself heavily upon the\r\nsofa, disregarding as usual the fate of his hat, which, as if accustomed\r\nto take care of itself, made for a safe shelter under the table.\r\n\r\nHe was tired.  The last particle of his nervous force had been expended\r\nin the wonders and agonies of this day full of surprising failures coming\r\nat the end of a harassing month of scheming and insomnia.  He was tired.\r\nA man isn\xe2\x80\x99t made of stone.  Hang everything!  Mr Verloc reposed\r\ncharacteristically, clad in his outdoor garments.  One side of his open\r\novercoat was lying partly on the ground.  Mr Verloc wallowed on his back.\r\nBut he longed for a more perfect rest\xe2\x80\x94for sleep\xe2\x80\x94for a few hours of\r\ndelicious forgetfulness.  That would come later.  Provisionally he\r\nrested.  And he thought: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish she would give over this damned\r\nnonsense.  It\xe2\x80\x99s exasperating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere must have been something imperfect in Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s sentiment of\r\nregained freedom.  Instead of taking the way of the door she leaned back,\r\nwith her shoulders against the tablet of the mantelpiece, as a wayfarer\r\nrests against a fence.  A tinge of wildness in her aspect was derived\r\nfrom the black veil hanging like a rag against her cheek, and from the\r\nfixity of her black gaze where the light of the room was absorbed and\r\nlost without the trace of a single gleam.  This woman, capable of a\r\nbargain the mere suspicion of which would have been infinitely shocking\r\nto Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s idea of love, remained irresolute, as if scrupulously\r\naware of something wanting on her part for the formal closing of the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nOn the sofa Mr Verloc wriggled his shoulders into perfect comfort, and\r\nfrom the fulness of his heart emitted a wish which was certainly as pious\r\nas anything likely to come from such a source.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to goodness,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled huskily, \xe2\x80\x9cI had never seen Greenwich\r\nPark or anything belonging to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe veiled sound filled the small room with its moderate volume, well\r\nadapted to the modest nature of the wish.  The waves of air of the proper\r\nlength, propagated in accordance with correct mathematical formulas,\r\nflowed around all the inanimate things in the room, lapped against Mrs\r\nVerloc\xe2\x80\x99s head as if it had been a head of stone.  And incredible as it\r\nmay appear, the eyes of Mrs Verloc seemed to grow still larger.  The\r\naudible wish of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s overflowing heart flowed into an empty place\r\nin his wife\xe2\x80\x99s memory.  Greenwich Park.  A park!  That\xe2\x80\x99s where the boy was\r\nkilled.  A park\xe2\x80\x94smashed branches, torn leaves, gravel, bits of brotherly\r\nflesh and bone, all spouting up together in the manner of a firework.\r\nShe remembered now what she had heard, and she remembered it pictorially.\r\nThey had to gather him up with the shovel.  Trembling all over with\r\nirrepressible shudders, she saw before her the very implement with its\r\nghastly load scraped up from the ground.  Mrs Verloc closed her eyes\r\ndesperately, throwing upon that vision the night of her eyelids, where\r\nafter a rainlike fall of mangled limbs the decapitated head of Stevie\r\nlingered suspended alone, and fading out slowly like the last star of a\r\npyrotechnic display.  Mrs Verloc opened her eyes.\r\n\r\nHer face was no longer stony.  Anybody could have noted the subtle change\r\non her features, in the stare of her eyes, giving her a new and startling\r\nexpression; an expression seldom observed by competent persons under the\r\nconditions of leisure and security demanded for thorough analysis, but\r\nwhose meaning could not be mistaken at a glance.  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s doubts as\r\nto the end of the bargain no longer existed; her wits, no longer\r\ndisconnected, were working under the control of her will.  But Mr Verloc\r\nobserved nothing.  He was reposing in that pathetic condition of optimism\r\ninduced by excess of fatigue.  He did not want any more trouble\xe2\x80\x94with his\r\nwife too\xe2\x80\x94of all people in the world.  He had been unanswerable in his\r\nvindication.  He was loved for himself.  The present phase of her silence\r\nhe interpreted favourably.  This was the time to make it up with her.\r\nThe silence had lasted long enough.  He broke it by calling to her in an\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWinnie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered obediently Mrs Verloc the free woman.  She commanded her\r\nwits now, her vocal organs; she felt herself to be in an almost\r\npreternaturally perfect control of every fibre of her body.  It was all\r\nher own, because the bargain was at an end.  She was clear sighted.  She\r\nhad become cunning.  She chose to answer him so readily for a purpose.\r\nShe did not wish that man to change his position on the sofa which was\r\nvery suitable to the circumstances.  She succeeded.  The man did not\r\nstir.  But after answering him she remained leaning negligently against\r\nthe mantelpiece in the attitude of a resting wayfarer.  She was\r\nunhurried.  Her brow was smooth.  The head and shoulders of Mr Verloc\r\nwere hidden from her by the high side of the sofa.  She kept her eyes\r\nfixed on his feet.\r\n\r\nShe remained thus mysteriously still and suddenly collected till Mr\r\nVerloc was heard with an accent of marital authority, and moving slightly\r\nto make room for her to sit on the edge of the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a peculiar tone, which might have been the tone\r\nof brutality, but was intimately known to Mrs Verloc as the note of\r\nwooing.\r\n\r\nShe started forward at once, as if she were still a loyal woman bound to\r\nthat man by an unbroken contract.  Her right hand skimmed slightly the\r\nend of the table, and when she had passed on towards the sofa the carving\r\nknife had vanished without the slightest sound from the side of the dish.\r\nMr Verloc heard the creaky plank in the floor, and was content.  He\r\nwaited.  Mrs Verloc was coming.  As if the homeless soul of Stevie had\r\nflown for shelter straight to the breast of his sister, guardian and\r\nprotector, the resemblance of her face with that of her brother grew at\r\nevery step, even to the droop of the lower lip, even to the slight\r\ndivergence of the eyes.  But Mr Verloc did not see that.  He was lying on\r\nhis back and staring upwards.  He saw partly on the ceiling and partly on\r\nthe wall the moving shadow of an arm with a clenched hand holding a\r\ncarving knife.  It flickered up and down.  Its movements were leisurely.\r\nThey were leisurely enough for Mr Verloc to recognise the limb and the\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nThey were leisurely enough for him to take in the full meaning of the\r\nportent, and to taste the flavour of death rising in his gorge.  His wife\r\nhad gone raving mad\xe2\x80\x94murdering mad.  They were leisurely enough for the\r\nfirst paralysing effect of this discovery to pass away before a resolute\r\ndetermination to come out victorious from the ghastly struggle with that\r\narmed lunatic.  They were leisurely enough for Mr Verloc to elaborate a\r\nplan of defence involving a dash behind the table, and the felling of the\r\nwoman to the ground with a heavy wooden chair.  But they were not\r\nleisurely enough to allow Mr Verloc the time to move either hand or foot.\r\nThe knife was already planted in his breast.  It met no resistance on its\r\nway.  Hazard has such accuracies.  Into that plunging blow, delivered\r\nover the side of the couch, Mrs Verloc had put all the inheritance of her\r\nimmemorial and obscure descent, the simple ferocity of the age of\r\ncaverns, and the unbalanced nervous fury of the age of bar-rooms.  Mr\r\nVerloc, the Secret Agent, turning slightly on his side with the force of\r\nthe blow, expired without stirring a limb, in the muttered sound of the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d by way of protest.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc had let go the knife, and her extraordinary resemblance to her\r\nlate brother had faded, had become very ordinary now.  She drew a deep\r\nbreath, the first easy breath since Chief Inspector Heat had exhibited to\r\nher the labelled piece of Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat.  She leaned forward on her\r\nfolded arms over the side of the sofa.  She adopted that easy attitude\r\nnot in order to watch or gloat over the body of Mr Verloc, but because of\r\nthe undulatory and swinging movements of the parlour, which for some time\r\nbehaved as though it were at sea in a tempest.  She was giddy but calm.\r\nShe had become a free woman with a perfection of freedom which left her\r\nnothing to desire and absolutely nothing to do, since Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s urgent\r\nclaim on her devotion no longer existed.  Mrs Verloc, who thought in\r\nimages, was not troubled now by visions, because she did not think at\r\nall.  And she did not move.  She was a woman enjoying her complete\r\nirresponsibility and endless leisure, almost in the manner of a corpse.\r\nShe did not move, she did not think.  Neither did the mortal envelope of\r\nthe late Mr Verloc reposing on the sofa.  Except for the fact that Mrs\r\nVerloc breathed these two would have been perfect in accord: that accord\r\nof prudent reserve without superfluous words, and sparing of signs, which\r\nhad been the foundation of their respectable home life.  For it had been\r\nrespectable, covering by a decent reticence the problems that may arise\r\nin the practice of a secret profession and the commerce of shady wares.\r\nTo the last its decorum had remained undisturbed by unseemly shrieks and\r\nother misplaced sincerities of conduct.  And after the striking of the\r\nblow, this respectability was continued in immobility and silence.\r\n\r\nNothing moved in the parlour till Mrs Verloc raised her head slowly and\r\nlooked at the clock with inquiring mistrust.  She had become aware of a\r\nticking sound in the room.  It grew upon her ear, while she remembered\r\nclearly that the clock on the wall was silent, had no audible tick.  What\r\ndid it mean by beginning to tick so loudly all of a sudden?  Its face\r\nindicated ten minutes to nine.  Mrs Verloc cared nothing for time, and\r\nthe ticking went on.  She concluded it could not be the clock, and her\r\nsullen gaze moved along the walls, wavered, and became vague, while she\r\nstrained her hearing to locate the sound.  Tic, tic, tic.\r\n\r\nAfter listening for some time Mrs Verloc lowered her gaze deliberately on\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s body.  Its attitude of repose was so home-like and familiar\r\nthat she could do so without feeling embarrassed by any pronounced\r\nnovelty in the phenomena of her home life.  Mr Verloc was taking his\r\nhabitual ease.  He looked comfortable.\r\n\r\nBy the position of the body the face of Mr Verloc was not visible to Mrs\r\nVerloc, his widow.  Her fine, sleepy eyes, travelling downward on the\r\ntrack of the sound, became contemplative on meeting a flat object of bone\r\nwhich protruded a little beyond the edge of the sofa.  It was the handle\r\nof the domestic carving knife with nothing strange about it but its\r\nposition at right angles to Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat and the fact that\r\nsomething dripped from it.  Dark drops fell on the floorcloth one after\r\nanother, with a sound of ticking growing fast and furious like the pulse\r\nof an insane clock.  At its highest speed this ticking changed into a\r\ncontinuous sound of trickling.  Mrs Verloc watched that transformation\r\nwith shadows of anxiety coming and going on her face.  It was a trickle,\r\ndark, swift, thin. . . . Blood!\r\n\r\nAt this unforeseen circumstance Mrs Verloc abandoned her pose of idleness\r\nand irresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden snatch at her skirts and a faint shriek she ran to the\r\ndoor, as if the trickle had been the first sign of a destroying flood.\r\nFinding the table in her way she gave it a push with both hands as though\r\nit had been alive, with such force that it went for some distance on its\r\nfour legs, making a loud, scraping racket, whilst the big dish with the\r\njoint crashed heavily on the floor.\r\n\r\nThen all became still.  Mrs Verloc on reaching the door had stopped.  A\r\nround hat disclosed in the middle of the floor by the moving of the table\r\nrocked slightly on its crown in the wind of her flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nWinnie Verloc, the widow of Mr Verloc, the sister of the late faithful\r\nStevie (blown to fragments in a state of innocence and in the conviction\r\nof being engaged in a humanitarian enterprise), did not run beyond the\r\ndoor of the parlour.  She had indeed run away so far from a mere trickle\r\nof blood, but that was a movement of instinctive repulsion.  And there\r\nshe had paused, with staring eyes and lowered head.  As though she had\r\nrun through long years in her flight across the small parlour, Mrs Verloc\r\nby the door was quite a different person from the woman who had been\r\nleaning over the sofa, a little swimmy in her head, but otherwise free to\r\nenjoy the profound calm of idleness and irresponsibility.  Mrs Verloc was\r\nno longer giddy.  Her head was steady.  On the other hand, she was no\r\nlonger calm.  She was afraid.\r\n\r\nIf she avoided looking in the direction of her reposing husband it was\r\nnot because she was afraid of him.  Mr Verloc was not frightful to\r\nbehold.  He looked comfortable.  Moreover, he was dead.  Mrs Verloc\r\nentertained no vain delusions on the subject of the dead.  Nothing brings\r\nthem back, neither love nor hate.  They can do nothing to you.  They are\r\nas nothing.  Her mental state was tinged by a sort of austere contempt\r\nfor that man who had let himself be killed so easily.  He had been the\r\nmaster of a house, the husband of a woman, and the murderer of her\r\nStevie.  And now he was of no account in every respect.  He was of less\r\npractical account than the clothing on his body, than his overcoat, than\r\nhis boots\xe2\x80\x94than that hat lying on the floor.  He was nothing.  He was not\r\nworth looking at.  He was even no longer the murderer of poor Stevie.\r\nThe only murderer that would be found in the room when people came to\r\nlook for Mr Verloc would be\xe2\x80\x94herself!\r\n\r\nHer hands shook so that she failed twice in the task of refastening her\r\nveil.  Mrs Verloc was no longer a person of leisure and responsibility.\r\nShe was afraid.  The stabbing of Mr Verloc had been only a blow.  It had\r\nrelieved the pent-up agony of shrieks strangled in her throat, of tears\r\ndried up in her hot eyes, of the maddening and indignant rage at the\r\natrocious part played by that man, who was less than nothing now, in\r\nrobbing her of the boy.\r\n\r\nIt had been an obscurely prompted blow.  The blood trickling on the floor\r\noff the handle of the knife had turned it into an extremely plain case of\r\nmurder.  Mrs Verloc, who always refrained from looking deep into things,\r\nwas compelled to look into the very bottom of this thing.  She saw there\r\nno haunting face, no reproachful shade, no vision of remorse, no sort of\r\nideal conception.  She saw there an object.  That object was the gallows.\r\nMrs Verloc was afraid of the gallows.\r\n\r\nShe was terrified of them ideally.  Having never set eyes on that last\r\nargument of men\xe2\x80\x99s justice except in illustrative woodcuts to a certain\r\ntype of tales, she first saw them erect against a black and stormy\r\nbackground, festooned with chains and human bones, circled about by birds\r\nthat peck at dead men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.  This was frightful enough, but Mrs Verloc,\r\nthough not a well-informed woman, had a sufficient knowledge of the\r\ninstitutions of her country to know that gallows are no longer erected\r\nromantically on the banks of dismal rivers or on wind-swept headlands,\r\nbut in the yards of jails.  There within four high walls, as if into a\r\npit, at dawn of day, the murderer was brought out to be executed, with a\r\nhorrible quietness and, as the reports in the newspapers always said, \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nthe presence of the authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d  With her eyes staring on the floor,\r\nher nostrils quivering with anguish and shame, she imagined herself all\r\nalone amongst a lot of strange gentlemen in silk hats who were calmly\r\nproceeding about the business of hanging her by the neck.  That\xe2\x80\x94never!\r\nNever!  And how was it done?  The impossibility of imagining the details\r\nof such quiet execution added something maddening to her abstract terror.\r\nThe newspapers never gave any details except one, but that one with some\r\naffectation was always there at the end of a meagre report.  Mrs Verloc\r\nremembered its nature.  It came with a cruel burning pain into her head,\r\nas if the words \xe2\x80\x9cThe drop given was fourteen feet\xe2\x80\x9d had been scratched on\r\nher brain with a hot needle.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe drop given was fourteen feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words affected her physically too.  Her throat became convulsed in\r\nwaves to resist strangulation; and the apprehension of the jerk was so\r\nvivid that she seized her head in both hands as if to save it from being\r\ntorn off her shoulders.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe drop given was fourteen feet.\xe2\x80\x9d  No! that\r\nmust never be.  She could not stand _that_.  The thought of it even was\r\nnot bearable.  She could not stand thinking of it.  Therefore Mrs Verloc\r\nformed the resolution to go at once and throw herself into the river off\r\none of the bridges.\r\n\r\nThis time she managed to refasten her veil.  With her face as if masked,\r\nall black from head to foot except for some flowers in her hat, she\r\nlooked up mechanically at the clock.  She thought it must have stopped.\r\nShe could not believe that only two minutes had passed since she had\r\nlooked at it last.  Of course not.  It had been stopped all the time.  As\r\na matter of fact, only three minutes had elapsed from the moment she had\r\ndrawn the first deep, easy breath after the blow, to this moment when Mrs\r\nVerloc formed the resolution to drown herself in the Thames.  But Mrs\r\nVerloc could not believe that.  She seemed to have heard or read that\r\nclocks and watches always stopped at the moment of murder for the undoing\r\nof the murderer.  She did not care.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo the bridge\xe2\x80\x94and over I go.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\r\nBut her movements were slow.\r\n\r\nShe dragged herself painfully across the shop, and had to hold on to the\r\nhandle of the door before she found the necessary fortitude to open it.\r\nThe street frightened her, since it led either to the gallows or to the\r\nriver.  She floundered over the doorstep head forward, arms thrown out,\r\nlike a person falling over the parapet of a bridge.  This entrance into\r\nthe open air had a foretaste of drowning; a slimy dampness enveloped her,\r\nentered her nostrils, clung to her hair.  It was not actually raining,\r\nbut each gas lamp had a rusty little halo of mist.  The van and horses\r\nwere gone, and in the black street the curtained window of the carters\xe2\x80\x99\r\neating-house made a square patch of soiled blood-red light glowing\r\nfaintly very near the level of the pavement.  Mrs Verloc, dragging\r\nherself slowly towards it, thought that she was a very friendless woman.\r\nIt was true.  It was so true that, in a sudden longing to see some\r\nfriendly face, she could think of no one else but of Mrs Neale, the\r\ncharwoman.  She had no acquaintances of her own.  Nobody would miss her\r\nin a social way.  It must not be imagined that the Widow Verloc had\r\nforgotten her mother.  This was not so.  Winnie had been a good daughter\r\nbecause she had been a devoted sister.  Her mother had always leaned on\r\nher for support.  No consolation or advice could be expected there.  Now\r\nthat Stevie was dead the bond seemed to be broken.  She could not face\r\nthe old woman with the horrible tale.  Moreover, it was too far.  The\r\nriver was her present destination.  Mrs Verloc tried to forget her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nEach step cost her an effort of will which seemed the last possible.  Mrs\r\nVerloc had dragged herself past the red glow of the eating-house window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the bridge\xe2\x80\x94and over I go,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated to herself with fierce\r\nobstinacy.  She put out her hand just in time to steady herself against a\r\nlamp-post.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never get there before morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.  The fear\r\nof death paralysed her efforts to escape the gallows.  It seemed to her\r\nshe had been staggering in that street for hours.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never get\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll find me knocking about the streets.  It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo far.\xe2\x80\x9d  She held on, panting under her black veil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe drop given was fourteen feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pushed the lamp-post away from her violently, and found herself\r\nwalking.  But another wave of faintness overtook her like a great sea,\r\nwashing away her heart clean out of her breast.  \xe2\x80\x9cI will never get\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, suddenly arrested, swaying lightly where she stood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd perceiving the utter impossibility of walking as far as the nearest\r\nbridge, Mrs Verloc thought of a flight abroad.\r\n\r\nIt came to her suddenly.  Murderers escaped.  They escaped abroad.  Spain\r\nor California.  Mere names.  The vast world created for the glory of man\r\nwas only a vast blank to Mrs Verloc.  She did not know which way to turn.\r\nMurderers had friends, relations, helpers\xe2\x80\x94they had knowledge.  She had\r\nnothing.  She was the most lonely of murderers that ever struck a mortal\r\nblow.  She was alone in London: and the whole town of marvels and mud,\r\nwith its maze of streets and its mass of lights, was sunk in a hopeless\r\nnight, rested at the bottom of a black abyss from which no unaided woman\r\ncould hope to scramble out.\r\n\r\nShe swayed forward, and made a fresh start blindly, with an awful dread\r\nof falling down; but at the end of a few steps, unexpectedly, she found a\r\nsensation of support, of security.  Raising her head, she saw a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface peering closely at her veil.  Comrade Ossipon was not afraid of\r\nstrange women, and no feeling of false delicacy could prevent him from\r\nstriking an acquaintance with a woman apparently very much intoxicated.\r\nComrade Ossipon was interested in women.  He held up this one between his\r\ntwo large palms, peering at her in a business-like way till he heard her\r\nsay faintly \xe2\x80\x9cMr Ossipon!\xe2\x80\x9d and then he very nearly let her drop to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs Verloc!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible to him that she should have been drinking.  But one\r\nnever knows.  He did not go into that question, but attentive not to\r\ndiscourage kind fate surrendering to him the widow of Comrade Verloc, he\r\ntried to draw her to his breast.  To his astonishment she came quite\r\neasily, and even rested on his arm for a moment before she attempted to\r\ndisengage herself.  Comrade Ossipon would not be brusque with kind fate.\r\nHe withdrew his arm in a natural way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou recognised me,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered out, standing before him, fairly steady\r\non her legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon with perfect readiness.  \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid\r\nyou were going to fall.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of you too often lately not to\r\nrecognise you anywhere, at any time.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought of you\xe2\x80\x94ever\r\nsince I first set eyes on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc seemed not to hear.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou were coming to the shop?\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; at once,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ossipon.  \xe2\x80\x9cDirectly I read the paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Comrade Ossipon had been skulking for a good two hours in the\r\nneighbourhood of Brett Street, unable to make up his mind for a bold\r\nmove.  The robust anarchist was not exactly a bold conqueror.  He\r\nremembered that Mrs Verloc had never responded to his glances by the\r\nslightest sign of encouragement.  Besides, he thought the shop might be\r\nwatched by the police, and Comrade Ossipon did not wish the police to\r\nform an exaggerated notion of his revolutionary sympathies.  Even now he\r\ndid not know precisely what to do.  In comparison with his usual amatory\r\nspeculations this was a big and serious undertaking.  He ignored how much\r\nthere was in it and how far he would have to go in order to get hold of\r\nwhat there was to get\xe2\x80\x94supposing there was a chance at all.  These\r\nperplexities checking his elation imparted to his tone a soberness well\r\nin keeping with the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask you where you were going?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired in a subdued voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs Verloc with a shuddering, repressed violence.\r\nAll her strong vitality recoiled from the idea of death.  \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\r\nwhere I was going. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon concluded that she was very much excited but perfectly sober.\r\nShe remained silent by his side for moment, then all at once she did\r\nsomething which he did not expect.  She slipped her hand under his arm.\r\nHe was startled by the act itself certainly, and quite as much too by the\r\npalpably resolute character of this movement.  But this being a delicate\r\naffair, Comrade Ossipon behaved with delicacy.  He contented himself by\r\npressing the hand slightly against his robust ribs.  At the same time he\r\nfelt himself being impelled forward, and yielded to the impulse.  At the\r\nend of Brett Street he became aware of being directed to the left.  He\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\nThe fruiterer at the corner had put out the blazing glory of his oranges\r\nand lemons, and Brett Place was all darkness, interspersed with the misty\r\nhalos of the few lamps defining its triangular shape, with a cluster of\r\nthree lights on one stand in the middle.  The dark forms of the man and\r\nwoman glided slowly arm in arm along the walls with a loverlike and\r\nhomeless aspect in the miserable night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you say if I were to tell you that I was going to find you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs Verloc asked, gripping his arm with force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would say that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anyone more ready to help you in your\r\ntrouble,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ossipon, with a notion of making tremendous headway.\r\nIn fact, the progress of this delicate affair was almost taking his\r\nbreath away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my trouble!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc repeated slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know what my trouble is?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered with strange\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes after seeing the evening paper,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Ossipon with\r\nardour, \xe2\x80\x9cI met a fellow whom you may have seen once or twice at the shop\r\nperhaps, and I had a talk with him which left no doubt whatever in my\r\nmind.  Then I started for here, wondering whether you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been fond of\r\nyou beyond words ever since I set eyes on your face,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, as if\r\nunable to command his feelings.\r\n\r\nComrade Ossipon assumed correctly that no woman was capable of wholly\r\ndisbelieving such a statement.  But he did not know that Mrs Verloc\r\naccepted it with all the fierceness the instinct of self-preservation\r\nputs into the grip of a drowning person.  To the widow of Mr Verloc the\r\nrobust anarchist was like a radiant messenger of life.\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly, in step.  \xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc murmured\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve read it in my eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Ossipon with great assurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she breathed out into his inclined ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA love like mine could not be concealed from a woman like you,\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\non, trying to detach his mind from material considerations such as the\r\nbusiness value of the shop, and the amount of money Mr Verloc might have\r\nleft in the bank.  He applied himself to the sentimental side of the\r\naffair.  In his heart of hearts he was a little shocked at his success.\r\nVerloc had been a good fellow, and certainly a very decent husband as far\r\nas one could see.  However, Comrade Ossipon was not going to quarrel with\r\nhis luck for the sake of a dead man.  Resolutely he suppressed his\r\nsympathy for the ghost of Comrade Verloc, and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not conceal it.  I was too full of you.  I daresay you could not\r\nhelp seeing it in my eyes.  But I could not guess it.  You were always so\r\ndistant. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else did you expect?\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Mrs Verloc.  \xe2\x80\x9cI was a respectable\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, then added, as if speaking to herself, in sinister\r\nresentment: \xe2\x80\x9cTill he made me what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon let that pass, and took up his running.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe never did seem to me\r\nto be quite worthy of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, throwing loyalty to the winds.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were worthy of a better fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc interrupted bitterly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter fate!  He cheated me out of seven years of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seemed to live so happily with him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ossipon tried to exculpate the\r\nlukewarmness of his past conduct.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s that what\xe2\x80\x99s made me timid.  You\r\nseemed to love him.  I was surprised\xe2\x80\x94and jealous,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove him!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc cried out in a whisper, full of scorn and rage.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove him!  I was a good wife to him.  I am a respectable woman.  You\r\nthought I loved him!  You did!  Look here, Tom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of this name thrilled Comrade Ossipon with pride.  For his name\r\nwas Alexander, and he was called Tom by arrangement with the most\r\nfamiliar of his intimates.  It was a name of friendship\xe2\x80\x94of moments of\r\nexpansion.  He had no idea that she had ever heard it used by anybody.\r\nIt was apparent that she had not only caught it, but had treasured it in\r\nher memory\xe2\x80\x94perhaps in her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Tom!  I was a young girl.  I was done up.  I was tired.  I\r\nhad two people depending on what I could do, and it did seem as if I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do any more.  Two people\xe2\x80\x94mother and the boy.  He was much more\r\nmine than mother\xe2\x80\x99s.  I sat up nights and nights with him on my lap, all\r\nalone upstairs, when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t more than eight years old myself.  And\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94He was mine, I tell you. . . . You can\xe2\x80\x99t understand that.  No man\r\ncan understand it.  What was I to do?  There was a young fellow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe memory of the early romance with the young butcher survived,\r\ntenacious, like the image of a glimpsed ideal in that heart quailing\r\nbefore the fear of the gallows and full of revolt against death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the man I loved then,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the widow of Mr Verloc.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose he could see it in my eyes too.  Five and twenty shillings a\r\nweek, and his father threatened to kick him out of the business if he\r\nmade such a fool of himself as to marry a girl with a crippled mother and\r\na crazy idiot of a boy on her hands.  But he would hang about me, till\r\none evening I found the courage to slam the door in his face.  I had to\r\ndo it.  I loved him dearly.  Five and twenty shillings a week!  There was\r\nthat other man\xe2\x80\x94a good lodger.  What is a girl to do?  Could I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on\r\nthe streets?  He seemed kind.  He wanted me, anyhow.  What was I to do\r\nwith mother and that poor boy?  Eh?  I said yes.  He seemed good-natured,\r\nhe was freehanded, he had money, he never said anything.  Seven\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94seven years a good wife to him, the kind, the good, the generous,\r\nthe\xe2\x80\x94And he loved me.  Oh yes.  He loved me till I sometimes wished\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94Seven years.  Seven years a wife to him.  And do you know what he\r\nwas, that dear friend of yours?  Do you know what he was?  He was a\r\ndevil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe superhuman vehemence of that whispered statement completely stunned\r\nComrade Ossipon.  Winnie Verloc turning about held him by both arms,\r\nfacing him under the falling mist in the darkness and solitude of Brett\r\nPlace, in which all sounds of life seemed lost as if in a triangular well\r\nof asphalt and bricks, of blind houses and unfeeling stones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, with a sort of flabby stupidity, whose\r\ncomical aspect was lost upon a woman haunted by the fear of the gallows,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I do now.  I\xe2\x80\x94I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he floundered on, his mind speculating\r\nas to what sort of atrocities Verloc could have practised under the\r\nsleepy, placid appearances of his married estate.  It was positively\r\nawful.  \xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, and then by a sudden inspiration\r\nuttered an\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy woman!\xe2\x80\x9d of lofty commiseration instead of the more\r\nfamiliar \xe2\x80\x9cPoor darling!\xe2\x80\x9d of his usual practice.  This was no usual case.\r\nHe felt conscious of something abnormal going on, while he never lost\r\nsight of the greatness of the stake.  \xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy, brave woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was glad to have discovered that variation; but he could discover\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but he is dead now,\xe2\x80\x9d was the best he could do.  And he put a\r\nremarkable amount of animosity into his guarded exclamation.  Mrs Verloc\r\ncaught at his arm with a sort of frenzy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou guessed then he was dead,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, as if beside herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!  You guessed what I had to do.  Had to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were suggestions of triumph, relief, gratitude in the indefinable\r\ntone of these words.  It engrossed the whole attention of Ossipon to the\r\ndetriment of mere literal sense.  He wondered what was up with her, why\r\nshe had worked herself into this state of wild excitement.  He even began\r\nto wonder whether the hidden causes of that Greenwich Park affair did not\r\nlie deep in the unhappy circumstances of the Verlocs\xe2\x80\x99 married life.  He\r\nwent so far as to suspect Mr Verloc of having selected that extraordinary\r\nmanner of committing suicide.  By Jove! that would account for the utter\r\ninanity and wrong-headedness of the thing.  No anarchist manifestation\r\nwas required by the circumstances.  Quite the contrary; and Verloc was as\r\nwell aware of that as any other revolutionist of his standing.  What an\r\nimmense joke if Verloc had simply made fools of the whole of Europe, of\r\nthe revolutionary world, of the police, of the press, and of the cocksure\r\nProfessor as well.  Indeed, thought Ossipon, in astonishment, it seemed\r\nalmost certain that he did!  Poor beggar!  It struck him as very possible\r\nthat of that household of two it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t precisely the man who was the\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\nAlexander Ossipon, nicknamed the Doctor, was naturally inclined to think\r\nindulgently of his men friends.  He eyed Mrs Verloc hanging on his arm.\r\nOf his women friends he thought in a specially practical way.  Why Mrs\r\nVerloc should exclaim at his knowledge of Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s death, which was no\r\nguess at all, did not disturb him beyond measure.  They often talked like\r\nlunatics.  But he was curious to know how she had been informed.  The\r\npapers could tell her nothing beyond the mere fact: the man blown to\r\npieces in Greenwich Park not having been identified.  It was\r\ninconceivable on any theory that Verloc should have given her an inkling\r\nof his intention\xe2\x80\x94whatever it was.  This problem interested Comrade\r\nOssipon immensely.  He stopped short.  They had gone then along the three\r\nsides of Brett Place, and were near the end of Brett Street again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you first come to hear of it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in a tone he tried to\r\nrender appropriate to the character of the revelations which had been\r\nmade to him by the woman at his side.\r\n\r\nShe shook violently for a while before she answered in a listless voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the police.  A chief inspector came, Chief Inspector Heat he said\r\nhe was.  He showed me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc choked.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, they had to gather him up with a shovel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer breast heaved with dry sobs.  In a moment Ossipon found his tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe police!  Do you mean to say the police came already?  That Chief\r\nInspector Heat himself actually came to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she confirmed in the same listless tone.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe came just like this.\r\nHe came.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.  He showed me a piece of overcoat, and\xe2\x80\x94just like\r\nthat.  Do you know this? he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeat!  Heat!  And what did he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s head dropped.  \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.  He did nothing.  He went away.\r\nThe police were on that man\xe2\x80\x99s side,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured tragically.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnother\r\none came too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother\xe2\x80\x94another inspector, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ossipon, in great\r\nexcitement, and very much in the tone of a scared child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  He came.  He looked like a foreigner.  He may have been\r\none of them Embassy people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nComrade Ossipon nearly collapsed under this new shock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmbassy!  Are you aware what you are saying?  What Embassy?  What on\r\nearth do you mean by Embassy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s that place in Chesham Square.  The people he cursed so.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow.  What does it matter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that fellow, what did he do or say to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember. . . . Nothing . . . . I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe pleaded in a weary voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.  I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Ossipon tenderly.  And he meant it too,\r\nnot because he was touched by the pathos of the pleading voice, but\r\nbecause he felt himself losing his footing in the depths of this\r\ntenebrous affair.  Police!  Embassy!  Phew!  For fear of adventuring his\r\nintelligence into ways where its natural lights might fail to guide it\r\nsafely he dismissed resolutely all suppositions, surmises, and theories\r\nout of his mind.  He had the woman there, absolutely flinging herself at\r\nhim, and that was the principal consideration.  But after what he had\r\nheard nothing could astonish him any more.  And when Mrs Verloc, as if\r\nstartled suddenly out of a dream of safety, began to urge upon him wildly\r\nthe necessity of an immediate flight on the Continent, he did not exclaim\r\nin the least.  He simply said with unaffected regret that there was no\r\ntrain till the morning, and stood looking thoughtfully at her face,\r\nveiled in black net, in the light of a gas lamp veiled in a gauze of\r\nmist.\r\n\r\nNear him, her black form merged in the night, like a figure half\r\nchiselled out of a block of black stone.  It was impossible to say what\r\nshe knew, how deep she was involved with policemen and Embassies.  But if\r\nshe wanted to get away, it was not for him to object.  He was anxious to\r\nbe off himself.  He felt that the business, the shop so strangely\r\nfamiliar to chief inspectors and members of foreign Embassies, was not\r\nthe place for him.  That must be dropped.  But there was the rest.  These\r\nsavings.  The money!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must hide me till the morning somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a dismayed\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFact is, my dear, I can\xe2\x80\x99t take you where I live.  I share the room with\r\na friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was somewhat dismayed himself.  In the morning the blessed \xe2\x80\x99tecs will\r\nbe out in all the stations, no doubt.  And if they once got hold of her,\r\nfor one reason or another she would be lost to him indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you care for me at all\xe2\x80\x94at all?  What are you\r\nthinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said this violently, but she let her clasped hands fall in\r\ndiscouragement.  There was a silence, while the mist fell, and darkness\r\nreigned undisturbed over Brett Place.  Not a soul, not even the vagabond,\r\nlawless, and amorous soul of a cat, came near the man and the woman\r\nfacing each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be possible perhaps to find a safe lodging somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d Ossipon\r\nspoke at last.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut the truth is, my dear, I have not enough money to go\r\nand try with\xe2\x80\x94only a few pence.  We revolutionists are not rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had fifteen shillings in his pocket.  He added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s the journey before us, too\xe2\x80\x94first thing in the morning at\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not move, made no sound, and Comrade Ossipon\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank a\r\nlittle.  Apparently she had no suggestion to offer.  Suddenly she\r\nclutched at her breast, as if she had felt a sharp pain there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped.  \xe2\x80\x9cI have the money.  I have enough money.  Tom!\r\nLet us go from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much have you got?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, without stirring to her tug; for he\r\nwas a cautious man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the money, I tell you.  All the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by it?  All the money there was in the bank, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked incredulously, but ready not to be surprised at anything in the\r\nway of luck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d she said nervously.  \xe2\x80\x9cAll there was.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow on earth did you manage to get hold of it already?\xe2\x80\x9d he marvelled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, suddenly subdued and trembling.\r\nComrade Ossipon put down his rising surprise with a firm hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then\xe2\x80\x94we are saved,\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered slowly.\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward, and sank against his breast.  He welcomed her there.\r\nShe had all the money.  Her hat was in the way of very marked effusion;\r\nher veil too.  He was adequate in his manifestations, but no more.  She\r\nreceived them without resistance and without abandonment, passively, as\r\nif only half-sensible.  She freed herself from his lax embraces without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will save me, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out, recoiling, but still keeping her\r\nhold on him by the two lapels of his damp coat.  \xe2\x80\x9cSave me.  Hide me.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let them have me.  You must kill me first.  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94not even for what I am afraid of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was confoundedly bizarre, he thought.  She was beginning to inspire\r\nhim with an indefinite uneasiness.  He said surlily, for he was busy with\r\nimportant thoughts:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil _are_ you afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you guessed what I was driven to do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the woman.\r\nDistracted by the vividness of her dreadful apprehensions, her head\r\nringing with forceful words, that kept the horror of her position before\r\nher mind, she had imagined her incoherence to be clearness itself.  She\r\nhad no conscience of how little she had audibly said in the disjointed\r\nphrases completed only in her thought.  She had felt the relief of a full\r\nconfession, and she gave a special meaning to every sentence spoken by\r\nComrade Ossipon, whose knowledge did not in the least resemble her own.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you guessed what I was driven to do!\xe2\x80\x9d  Her voice fell.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t be long in guessing then what I am afraid of,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, in\r\na bitter and sombre murmur.  \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have it.  I won\xe2\x80\x99t.  I won\xe2\x80\x99t.  I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t.  You must promise to kill me first!\xe2\x80\x9d  She shook the lapels of his\r\ncoat.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt must never be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe assured her curtly that no promises on his part were necessary, but he\r\ntook good care not to contradict her in set terms, because he had had\r\nmuch to do with excited women, and he was inclined in general to let his\r\nexperience guide his conduct in preference to applying his sagacity to\r\neach special case.  His sagacity in this case was busy in other\r\ndirections.  Women\xe2\x80\x99s words fell into water, but the shortcomings of\r\ntime-tables remained.  The insular nature of Great Britain obtruded\r\nitself upon his notice in an odious form.  \xe2\x80\x9cMight just as well be put\r\nunder lock and key every night,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought irritably, as nonplussed as\r\nthough he had a wall to scale with the woman on his back.  Suddenly he\r\nslapped his forehead.  He had by dint of cudgelling his brains just\r\nthought of the Southampton\xe2\x80\x94St Malo service.  The boat left about\r\nmidnight.  There was a train at 10.30.  He became cheery and ready to\r\nact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Waterloo.  Plenty of time.  We are all right after all. . . .\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?  This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, having hooked her arm into his, was trying to drag him into\r\nBrett Street again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten to shut the shop door as I went out,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered,\r\nterribly agitated.\r\n\r\nThe shop and all that was in it had ceased to interest Comrade Ossipon.\r\nHe knew how to limit his desires.  He was on the point of saying \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of\r\nthat?  Let it be,\xe2\x80\x9d but he refrained.  He disliked argument about trifles.\r\nHe even mended his pace considerably on the thought that she might have\r\nleft the money in the drawer.  But his willingness lagged behind her\r\nfeverish impatience.\r\n\r\nThe shop seemed to be quite dark at first.  The door stood ajar.  Mrs\r\nVerloc, leaning against the front, gasped out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody has been in.  Look!  The light\xe2\x80\x94the light in the parlour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon, stretching his head forward, saw a faint gleam in the darkness\r\nof the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot it.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s voice came from behind her veil faintly.  And\r\nas he stood waiting for her to enter first, she said louder: \xe2\x80\x9cGo in and\r\nput it out\xe2\x80\x94or I\xe2\x80\x99ll go mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no immediate objection to this proposal, so strangely motived.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s all that money?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn me!  Go, Tom.  Quick!  Put it out. . . . Go in!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, seizing\r\nhim by both shoulders from behind.\r\n\r\nNot prepared for a display of physical force, Comrade Ossipon stumbled\r\nfar into the shop before her push.  He was astonished at the strength of\r\nthe woman and scandalised by her proceedings.  But he did not retrace his\r\nsteps in order to remonstrate with her severely in the street.  He was\r\nbeginning to be disagreeably impressed by her fantastic behaviour.\r\nMoreover, this or never was the time to humour the woman.  Comrade\r\nOssipon avoided easily the end of the counter, and approached calmly the\r\nglazed door of the parlour.  The curtain over the panes being drawn back\r\na little he, by a very natural impulse, looked in, just as he made ready\r\nto turn the handle.  He looked in without a thought, without intention,\r\nwithout curiosity of any sort.  He looked in because he could not help\r\nlooking in.  He looked in, and discovered Mr Verloc reposing quietly on\r\nthe sofa.\r\n\r\nA yell coming from the innermost depths of his chest died out unheard and\r\ntransformed into a sort of greasy, sickly taste on his lips.  At the same\r\ntime the mental personality of Comrade Ossipon executed a frantic leap\r\nbackward.  But his body, left thus without intellectual guidance, held on\r\nto the door handle with the unthinking force of an instinct.  The robust\r\nanarchist did not even totter.  And he stared, his face close to the\r\nglass, his eyes protruding out of his head.  He would have given anything\r\nto get away, but his returning reason informed him that it would not do\r\nto let go the door handle.  What was it\xe2\x80\x94madness, a nightmare, or a trap\r\ninto which he had been decoyed with fiendish artfulness?  Why\xe2\x80\x94what for?\r\nHe did not know.  Without any sense of guilt in his breast, in the full\r\npeace of his conscience as far as these people were concerned, the idea\r\nthat he would be murdered for mysterious reasons by the couple Verloc\r\npassed not so much across his mind as across the pit of his stomach, and\r\nwent out, leaving behind a trail of sickly faintness\xe2\x80\x94an indisposition.\r\nComrade Ossipon did not feel very well in a very special way for a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94a long moment.  And he stared.  Mr Verloc lay very still\r\nmeanwhile, simulating sleep for reasons of his own, while that savage\r\nwoman of his was guarding the door\xe2\x80\x94invisible and silent in the dark and\r\ndeserted street.  Was all this a some sort of terrifying arrangement\r\ninvented by the police for his especial benefit?  His modesty shrank from\r\nthat explanation.\r\n\r\nBut the true sense of the scene he was beholding came to Ossipon through\r\nthe contemplation of the hat.  It seemed an extraordinary thing, an\r\nominous object, a sign.  Black, and rim upward, it lay on the floor\r\nbefore the couch as if prepared to receive the contributions of pence\r\nfrom people who would come presently to behold Mr Verloc in the fullness\r\nof his domestic ease reposing on a sofa.  From the hat the eyes of the\r\nrobust anarchist wandered to the displaced table, gazed at the broken\r\ndish for a time, received a kind of optical shock from observing a white\r\ngleam under the imperfectly closed eyelids of the man on the couch.  Mr\r\nVerloc did not seem so much asleep now as lying down with a bent head and\r\nlooking insistently at his left breast.  And when Comrade Ossipon had\r\nmade out the handle of the knife he turned away from the glazed door, and\r\nretched violently.\r\n\r\nThe crash of the street door flung to made his very soul leap in a panic.\r\nThis house with its harmless tenant could still be made a trap of\xe2\x80\x94a trap\r\nof a terrible kind.  Comrade Ossipon had no settled conception now of\r\nwhat was happening to him.  Catching his thigh against the end of the\r\ncounter, he spun round, staggered with a cry of pain, felt in the\r\ndistracting clatter of the bell his arms pinned to his side by a\r\nconvulsive hug, while the cold lips of a woman moved creepily on his very\r\near to form the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoliceman!  He has seen me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased to struggle; she never let him go.  Her hands had locked\r\nthemselves with an inseparable twist of fingers on his robust back.\r\nWhile the footsteps approached, they breathed quickly, breast to breast,\r\nwith hard, laboured breaths, as if theirs had been the attitude of a\r\ndeadly struggle, while, in fact, it was the attitude of deadly fear.  And\r\nthe time was long.\r\n\r\nThe constable on the beat had in truth seen something of Mrs Verloc; only\r\ncoming from the lighted thoroughfare at the other end of Brett Street,\r\nshe had been no more to him than a flutter in the darkness.  And he was\r\nnot even quite sure that there had been a flutter.  He had no reason to\r\nhurry up.  On coming abreast of the shop he observed that it had been\r\nclosed early.  There was nothing very unusual in that.  The men on duty\r\nhad special instructions about that shop: what went on about there was\r\nnot to be meddled with unless absolutely disorderly, but any observations\r\nmade were to be reported.  There were no observations to make; but from a\r\nsense of duty and for the peace of his conscience, owing also to that\r\ndoubtful flutter of the darkness, the constable crossed the road, and\r\ntried the door.  The spring latch, whose key was reposing for ever off\r\nduty in the late Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat pocket, held as well as usual.\r\nWhile the conscientious officer was shaking the handle, Ossipon felt the\r\ncold lips of the woman stirring again creepily against his very ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he comes in kill me\xe2\x80\x94kill me, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe constable moved away, flashing as he passed the light of his dark\r\nlantern, merely for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake, at the shop window.  For a moment longer\r\nthe man and the woman inside stood motionless, panting, breast to breast;\r\nthen her fingers came unlocked, her arms fell by her side slowly.\r\nOssipon leaned against the counter.  The robust anarchist wanted support\r\nbadly.  This was awful.  He was almost too disgusted for speech.  Yet he\r\nmanaged to utter a plaintive thought, showing at least that he realised\r\nhis position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a couple of minutes later and you\xe2\x80\x99d have made me blunder against\r\nthe fellow poking about here with his damned dark lantern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe widow of Mr Verloc, motionless in the middle of the shop, said\r\ninsistently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in and put that light out, Tom.  It will drive me crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw vaguely his vehement gesture of refusal.  Nothing in the world\r\nwould have induced Ossipon to go into the parlour.  He was not\r\nsuperstitious, but there was too much blood on the floor; a beastly pool\r\nof it all round the hat.  He judged he had been already far too near that\r\ncorpse for his peace of mind\xe2\x80\x94for the safety of his neck, perhaps!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the meter then!  There.  Look.  In that corner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe robust form of Comrade Ossipon, striding brusque and shadowy across\r\nthe shop, squatted in a corner obediently; but this obedience was without\r\ngrace.  He fumbled nervously\xe2\x80\x94and suddenly in the sound of a muttered\r\ncurse the light behind the glazed door flicked out to a gasping,\r\nhysterical sigh of a woman.  Night, the inevitable reward of men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaithful labours on this earth, night had fallen on Mr Verloc, the tried\r\nrevolutionist\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cone of the old lot\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the humble guardian of society; the\r\ninvaluable Secret Agent [delta] of Baron Stott-Wartenheim\xe2\x80\x99s despatches; a\r\nservant of law and order, faithful, trusted, accurate, admirable, with\r\nperhaps one single amiable weakness: the idealistic belief in being loved\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nOssipon groped his way back through the stuffy atmosphere, as black as\r\nink now, to the counter.  The voice of Mrs Verloc, standing in the middle\r\nof the shop, vibrated after him in that blackness with a desperate\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not be hanged, Tom.  I will not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke off.  Ossipon from the counter issued a warning: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t shout\r\nlike this,\xe2\x80\x9d then seemed to reflect profoundly.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou did this thing quite\r\nby yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired in a hollow voice, but with an appearance of\r\nmasterful calmness which filled Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s heart with grateful\r\nconfidence in his protecting strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, invisible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.  \xe2\x80\x9cNobody would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe heard him move about and the snapping of a lock in the parlour door.\r\nComrade Ossipon had turned the key on Mr Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s repose; and this he did\r\nnot from reverence for its eternal nature or any other obscurely\r\nsentimental consideration, but for the precise reason that he was not at\r\nall sure that there was not someone else hiding somewhere in the house.\r\nHe did not believe the woman, or rather he was incapable by now of\r\njudging what could be true, possible, or even probable in this astounding\r\nuniverse.  He was terrified out of all capacity for belief or disbelief\r\nin regard of this extraordinary affair, which began with police\r\ninspectors and Embassies and would end goodness knows where\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\nscaffold for someone.  He was terrified at the thought that he could not\r\nprove the use he made of his time ever since seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, for he had\r\nbeen skulking about Brett Street.  He was terrified at this savage woman\r\nwho had brought him in there, and would probably saddle him with\r\ncomplicity, at least if he were not careful.  He was terrified at the\r\nrapidity with which he had been involved in such dangers\xe2\x80\x94decoyed into it.\r\nIt was some twenty minutes since he had met her\xe2\x80\x94not more.\r\n\r\nThe voice of Mrs Verloc rose subdued, pleading piteously: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let them\r\nhang me, Tom!  Take me out of the country.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll work for you.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nslave for you.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll love you.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve no one in the world. . . .  Who\r\nwould look at me if you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d  She ceased for a moment; then in the\r\ndepths of the loneliness made round her by an insignificant thread of\r\nblood trickling off the handle of a knife, she found a dreadful\r\ninspiration to her\xe2\x80\x94who had been the respectable girl of the Belgravian\r\nmansion, the loyal, respectable wife of Mr Verloc.  \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to\r\nmarry me,\xe2\x80\x9d she breathed out in shame-faced accents.\r\n\r\nShe moved a step forward in the darkness.  He was terrified at her.  He\r\nwould not have been surprised if she had suddenly produced another knife\r\ndestined for his breast.  He certainly would have made no resistance.  He\r\nhad really not enough fortitude in him just then to tell her to keep\r\nback.  But he inquired in a cavernous, strange tone: \xe2\x80\x9cWas he asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and went on rapidly.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.  Not he.  He had been\r\ntelling me that nothing could touch him.  After taking the boy away from\r\nunder my very eyes to kill him\xe2\x80\x94the loving, innocent, harmless lad.  My\r\nown, I tell you.  He was lying on the couch quite easy\xe2\x80\x94after killing the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x94my boy.  I would have gone on the streets to get out of his sight.\r\nAnd he says to me like this: \xe2\x80\x98Come here,\xe2\x80\x99 after telling me I had helped\r\nto kill the boy.  You hear, Tom?  He says like this: \xe2\x80\x98Come here,\xe2\x80\x99 after\r\ntaking my very heart out of me along with the boy to smash in the dirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ceased, then dreamily repeated twice: \xe2\x80\x9cBlood and dirt.  Blood and\r\ndirt.\xe2\x80\x9d  A great light broke upon Comrade Ossipon.  It was that\r\nhalf-witted lad then who had perished in the park.  And the fooling of\r\neverybody all round appeared more complete than ever\xe2\x80\x94colossal.  He\r\nexclaimed scientifically, in the extremity of his astonishment: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ndegenerate\xe2\x80\x94by heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here.\xe2\x80\x9d  The voice of Mrs Verloc rose again.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he think I\r\nwas made of?  Tell me, Tom.  Come here!  Me!  Like this!  I had been\r\nlooking at the knife, and I thought I would come then if he wanted me so\r\nmuch.  Oh yes!  I came\xe2\x80\x94for the last time. . . . With the knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was excessively terrified at her\xe2\x80\x94the sister of the degenerate\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndegenerate herself of a murdering type . . . or else of the lying type.\r\nComrade Ossipon might have been said to be terrified scientifically in\r\naddition to all other kinds of fear.  It was an immeasurable and\r\ncomposite funk, which from its very excess gave him in the dark a false\r\nappearance of calm and thoughtful deliberation.  For he moved and spoke\r\nwith difficulty, being as if half frozen in his will and mind\xe2\x80\x94and no one\r\ncould see his ghastly face.  He felt half dead.\r\n\r\nHe leaped a foot high.  Unexpectedly Mrs Verloc had desecrated the\r\nunbroken reserved decency of her home by a shrill and terrible shriek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp, Tom!  Save me.  I won\xe2\x80\x99t be hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rushed forward, groping for her mouth with a silencing hand, and the\r\nshriek died out.  But in his rush he had knocked her over.  He felt her\r\nnow clinging round his legs, and his terror reached its culminating\r\npoint, became a sort of intoxication, entertained delusions, acquired the\r\ncharacteristics of delirium tremens.  He positively saw snakes now.  He\r\nsaw the woman twined round him like a snake, not to be shaken off.  She\r\nwas not deadly.  She was death itself\xe2\x80\x94the companion of life.\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, as if relieved by the outburst, was very far from behaving\r\nnoisily now.  She was pitiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, you can\xe2\x80\x99t throw me off now,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured from the floor.  \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\nunless you crush my head under your heel.  I won\xe2\x80\x99t leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon.\r\n\r\nHis face was so pale as to be quite visible in the profound black\r\ndarkness of the shop; while Mrs Verloc, veiled, had no face, almost no\r\ndiscernible form.  The trembling of something small and white, a flower\r\nin her hat, marked her place, her movements.\r\n\r\nIt rose in the blackness.  She had got up from the floor, and Ossipon\r\nregretted not having run out at once into the street.  But he perceived\r\neasily that it would not do.  It would not do.  She would run after him.\r\nShe would pursue him shrieking till she sent every policeman within\r\nhearing in chase.  And then goodness only knew what she would say of him.\r\nHe was so frightened that for a moment the insane notion of strangling\r\nher in the dark passed through his mind.  And he became more frightened\r\nthan ever!  She had him!  He saw himself living in abject terror in some\r\nobscure hamlet in Spain or Italy; till some fine morning they found him\r\ndead too, with a knife in his breast\xe2\x80\x94like Mr Verloc.  He sighed deeply.\r\nHe dared not move.  And Mrs Verloc waited in silence the good pleasure of\r\nher saviour, deriving comfort from his reflective silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he spoke up in an almost natural voice.  His reflections had\r\ncome to an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get out, or we will lose the train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going to, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked timidly.  Mrs Verloc was no\r\nlonger a free woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get to Paris first, the best way we can. . . . Go out first, and\r\nsee if the way\xe2\x80\x99s clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe obeyed.  Her voice came subdued through the cautiously opened door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon came out.  Notwithstanding his endeavours to be gentle, the\r\ncracked bell clattered behind the closed door in the empty shop, as if\r\ntrying in vain to warn the reposing Mr Verloc of the final departure of\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x94accompanied by his friend.\r\n\r\nIn the hansom they presently picked up, the robust anarchist became\r\nexplanatory.  He was still awfully pale, with eyes that seemed to have\r\nsunk a whole half-inch into his tense face.  But he seemed to have\r\nthought of everything with extraordinary method.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we arrive,\xe2\x80\x9d he discoursed in a queer, monotonous tone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must go\r\ninto the station ahead of me, as if we did not know each other.  I will\r\ntake the tickets, and slip in yours into your hand as I pass you.  Then\r\nyou will go into the first-class ladies\xe2\x80\x99 waiting-room, and sit there till\r\nten minutes before the train starts.  Then you come out.  I will be\r\noutside.  You go in first on the platform, as if you did not know me.\r\nThere may be eyes watching there that know what\xe2\x80\x99s what.  Alone you are\r\nonly a woman going off by train.  I am known.  With me, you may be\r\nguessed at as Mrs Verloc running away.  Do you understand, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, with an effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Verloc, sitting there against him in the hansom all rigid\r\nwith the dread of the gallows and the fear of death.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d  And\r\nshe added to herself, like an awful refrain: \xe2\x80\x9cThe drop given was fourteen\r\nfeet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon, not looking at her, and with a face like a fresh plaster cast of\r\nhimself after a wasting illness, said: \xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-by, I ought to have the\r\nmoney for the tickets now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc, undoing some hooks of her bodice, while she went on staring\r\nahead beyond the splashboard, handed over to him the new pigskin\r\npocket-book.  He received it without a word, and seemed to plunge it deep\r\nsomewhere into his very breast.  Then he slapped his coat on the outside.\r\n\r\nAll this was done without the exchange of a single glance; they were like\r\ntwo people looking out for the first sight of a desired goal.  It was not\r\ntill the hansom swung round a corner and towards the bridge that Ossipon\r\nopened his lips again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how much money there is in that thing?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as if\r\naddressing slowly some hobgoblin sitting between the ears of the horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs Verloc.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe gave it to me.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t count.  I thought\r\nnothing of it at the time.  Afterwards\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved her right hand a little.  It was so expressive that little\r\nmovement of that right hand which had struck the deadly blow into a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart less than an hour before that Ossipon could not repress a shudder.\r\nHe exaggerated it then purposely, and muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am cold.  I got chilled through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc looked straight ahead at the perspective of her escape.  Now\r\nand then, like a sable streamer blown across a road, the words \xe2\x80\x9cThe drop\r\ngiven was fourteen feet\xe2\x80\x9d got in the way of her tense stare.  Through her\r\nblack veil the whites of her big eyes gleamed lustrously like the eyes of\r\na masked woman.\r\n\r\nOssipon\xe2\x80\x99s rigidity had something business-like, a queer official\r\nexpression.  He was heard again all of a sudden, as though he had\r\nreleased a catch in order to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here!  Do you know whether your\xe2\x80\x94whether he kept his account at the\r\nbank in his own name or in some other name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs Verloc turned upon him her masked face and the big white gleam of her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther name?\xe2\x80\x9d she said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe exact in what you say,\xe2\x80\x9d Ossipon lectured in the swift motion of the\r\nhansom.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s extremely important.  I will explain to you.  The bank has\r\nthe numbers of these notes.  If they were paid to him in his own name,\r\nthen when his\xe2\x80\x94his death becomes known, the notes may serve to track us\r\nsince we have no other money.  You have no other money on you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head negatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever?\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few coppers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be dangerous in that case.  The money would have then to be\r\ndealt specially with.  Very specially.  We\xe2\x80\x99d have perhaps to lose more\r\nthan half the amount in order to get these notes changed in a certain\r\nsafe place I know of in Paris.  In the other case I mean if he had his\r\naccount and got paid out under some other name\xe2\x80\x94say Smith, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94the money is perfectly safe to use.  You understand?  The bank\r\nhas no means of knowing that Mr Verloc and, say, Smith are one and the\r\nsame person.  Do you see how important it is that you should make no\r\nmistake in answering me?  Can you answer that query at all?  Perhaps not.\r\nEh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said composedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember now!  He didn\xe2\x80\x99t bank in his own name.  He told me once that\r\nit was on deposit in the name of Prozor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think the bank had any knowledge of his real name?  Or anybody\r\nin the bank or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I know?  Is it likely, Tom?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely.  It would have been more comfortable to\r\nknow. . . . Here we are.  Get out first, and walk straight in.  Move\r\nsmartly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remained behind, and paid the cabman out of his own loose silver.  The\r\nprogramme traced by his minute foresight was carried out.  When Mrs\r\nVerloc, with her ticket for St Malo in her hand, entered the ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwaiting-room, Comrade Ossipon walked into the bar, and in seven minutes\r\nabsorbed three goes of hot brandy and water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrying to drive out a cold,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained to the barmaid, with a\r\nfriendly nod and a grimacing smile.  Then he came out, bringing out from\r\nthat festive interlude the face of a man who had drunk at the very\r\nFountain of Sorrow.  He raised his eyes to the clock.  It was time.  He\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\nPunctual, Mrs Verloc came out, with her veil down, and all black\xe2\x80\x94black as\r\ncommonplace death itself, crowned with a few cheap and pale flowers.  She\r\npassed close to a little group of men who were laughing, but whose\r\nlaughter could have been struck dead by a single word.  Her walk was\r\nindolent, but her back was straight, and Comrade Ossipon looked after it\r\nin terror before making a start himself.\r\n\r\nThe train was drawn up, with hardly anybody about its row of open doors.\r\nOwing to the time of the year and to the abominable weather there were\r\nhardly any passengers.  Mrs Verloc walked slowly along the line of empty\r\ncompartments till Ossipon touched her elbow from behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got in, and he remained on the platform looking about.  She bent\r\nforward, and in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Tom?  Is there any danger?  Wait a moment.  There\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nguard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw him accost the man in uniform.  They talked for a while.  She\r\nheard the guard say \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and saw him touch his cap.  Then\r\nOssipon came back, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI told him not to let anybody get into our\r\ncompartment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was leaning forward on her seat.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou think of everything. . . .\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get me off, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a gust of anguish, lifting her veil\r\nbrusquely to look at her saviour.\r\n\r\nShe had uncovered a face like adamant.  And out of this face the eyes\r\nlooked on, big, dry, enlarged, lightless, burnt out like two black holes\r\nin the white, shining globes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no danger,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gazing into them with an earnestness\r\nalmost rapt, which to Mrs Verloc, flying from the gallows, seemed to be\r\nfull of force and tenderness.  This devotion deeply moved her\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nadamantine face lost the stern rigidity of its terror.  Comrade Ossipon\r\ngazed at it as no lover ever gazed at his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s face.  Alexander\r\nOssipon, anarchist, nicknamed the Doctor, author of a medical (and\r\nimproper) pamphlet, late lecturer on the social aspects of hygiene to\r\nworking men\xe2\x80\x99s clubs, was free from the trammels of conventional\r\nmorality\xe2\x80\x94but he submitted to the rule of science.  He was scientific, and\r\nhe gazed scientifically at that woman, the sister of a degenerate, a\r\ndegenerate herself\xe2\x80\x94of a murdering type.  He gazed at her, and invoked\r\nLombroso, as an Italian peasant recommends himself to his favourite\r\nsaint.  He gazed scientifically.  He gazed at her cheeks, at her nose, at\r\nher eyes, at her ears. . . . Bad! . . . Fatal!  Mrs Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s pale lips\r\nparting, slightly relaxed under his passionately attentive gaze, he gazed\r\nalso at her teeth. . . . Not a doubt remained . . . a murdering type. . . .\r\nIf Comrade Ossipon did not recommend his terrified soul to Lombroso, it\r\nwas only because on scientific grounds he could not believe that he\r\ncarried about him such a thing as a soul.  But he had in him the\r\nscientific spirit, which moved him to testify on the platform of a\r\nrailway station in nervous jerky phrases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was an extraordinary lad, that brother of yours.  Most interesting to\r\nstudy.  A perfect type in a way.  Perfect!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke scientifically in his secret fear.  And Mrs Verloc, hearing\r\nthese words of commendation vouchsafed to her beloved dead, swayed\r\nforward with a flicker of light in her sombre eyes, like a ray of\r\nsunshine heralding a tempest of rain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was that indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered softly, with quivering lips.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ntook a lot of notice of him, Tom.  I loved you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost incredible the resemblance there was between you two,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npursued Ossipon, giving a voice to his abiding dread, and trying to\r\nconceal his nervous, sickening impatience for the train to start.  \xe2\x80\x9cYes;\r\nhe resembled you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were not especially touching or sympathetic.  But the fact of\r\nthat resemblance insisted upon was enough in itself to act upon her\r\nemotions powerfully.  With a little faint cry, and throwing her arms out,\r\nMrs Verloc burst into tears at last.\r\n\r\nOssipon entered the carriage, hastily closed the door and looked out to\r\nsee the time by the station clock.  Eight minutes more.  For the first\r\nthree of these Mrs Verloc wept violently and helplessly without pause or\r\ninterruption.  Then she recovered somewhat, and sobbed gently in an\r\nabundant fall of tears.  She tried to talk to her saviour, to the man who\r\nwas the messenger of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom!  How could I fear to die after he was taken away from me so\r\ncruelly!  How could I!  How could I be such a coward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lamented aloud her love of life, that life without grace or charm,\r\nand almost without decency, but of an exalted faithfulness of purpose,\r\neven unto murder.  And, as often happens in the lament of poor humanity,\r\nrich in suffering but indigent in words, the truth\xe2\x80\x94the very cry of\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94was found in a worn and artificial shape picked up somewhere among\r\nthe phrases of sham sentiment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I be so afraid of death!  Tom, I tried.  But I am afraid.  I\r\ntried to do away with myself.  And I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.  Am I hard?  I suppose the\r\ncup of horrors was not full enough for such as me.  Then when you came. . . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused.  Then in a gust of confidence and gratitude, \xe2\x80\x9cI will live all\r\nmy days for you, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo over into the other corner of the carriage, away from the platform,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Ossipon solicitously.  She let her saviour settle her comfortably,\r\nand he watched the coming on of another crisis of weeping, still more\r\nviolent than the first.  He watched the symptoms with a sort of medical\r\nair, as if counting seconds.  He heard the guard\xe2\x80\x99s whistle at last.  An\r\ninvoluntary contraction of the upper lip bared his teeth with all the\r\naspect of savage resolution as he felt the train beginning to move.  Mrs\r\nVerloc heard and felt nothing, and Ossipon, her saviour, stood still.  He\r\nfelt the train roll quicker, rumbling heavily to the sound of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloud sobs, and then crossing the carriage in two long strides he opened\r\nthe door deliberately, and leaped out.\r\n\r\nHe had leaped out at the very end of the platform; and such was his\r\ndetermination in sticking to his desperate plan that he managed by a sort\r\nof miracle, performed almost in the air, to slam to the door of the\r\ncarriage.  Only then did he find himself rolling head over heels like a\r\nshot rabbit.  He was bruised, shaken, pale as death, and out of breath\r\nwhen he got up.  But he was calm, and perfectly able to meet the excited\r\ncrowd of railway men who had gathered round him in a moment.  He\r\nexplained, in gentle and convincing tones, that his wife had started at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice for Brittany to her dying mother; that, of course, she\r\nwas greatly up-set, and he considerably concerned at her state; that he\r\nwas trying to cheer her up, and had absolutely failed to notice at first\r\nthat the train was moving out.  To the general exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou go on to Southampton, then, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he objected the inexperience of a\r\nyoung sister-in-law left alone in the house with three small children,\r\nand her alarm at his absence, the telegraph offices being closed.  He had\r\nacted on impulse.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever try that again,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nconcluded; smiled all round; distributed some small change, and marched\r\nwithout a limp out of the station.\r\n\r\nOutside, Comrade Ossipon, flush of safe banknotes as never before in his\r\nlife, refused the offer of a cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can walk,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a little friendly laugh to the civil driver.\r\n\r\nHe could walk.  He walked.  He crossed the bridge.  Later on the towers\r\nof the Abbey saw in their massive immobility the yellow bush of his hair\r\npassing under the lamps.  The lights of Victoria saw him too, and Sloane\r\nSquare, and the railings of the park.  And Comrade Ossipon once more\r\nfound himself on a bridge.  The river, a sinister marvel of still shadows\r\nand flowing gleams mingling below in a black silence, arrested his\r\nattention.  He stood looking over the parapet for a long time.  The clock\r\ntower boomed a brazen blast above his drooping head.  He looked up at the\r\ndial. . . . Half-past twelve of a wild night in the Channel.\r\n\r\nAnd again Comrade Ossipon walked.  His robust form was seen that night in\r\ndistant parts of the enormous town slumbering monstrously on a carpet of\r\nmud under a veil of raw mist.  It was seen crossing the streets without\r\nlife and sound, or diminishing in the interminable straight perspectives\r\nof shadowy houses bordering empty roadways lined by strings of gas lamps.\r\nHe walked through Squares, Places, Ovals, Commons, through monotonous\r\nstreets with unknown names where the dust of humanity settles inert and\r\nhopeless out of the stream of life.  He walked.  And suddenly turning\r\ninto a strip of a front garden with a mangy grass plot, he let himself\r\ninto a small grimy house with a latch-key he took out of his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself down on his bed all dressed, and lay still for a whole\r\nquarter of an hour.  Then he sat up suddenly, drawing up his knees, and\r\nclasping his legs.  The first dawn found him open-eyed, in that same\r\nposture.  This man who could walk so long, so far, so aimlessly, without\r\nshowing a sign of fatigue, could also remain sitting still for hours\r\nwithout stirring a limb or an eyelid.  But when the late sun sent its\r\nrays into the room he unclasped his hands, and fell back on the pillow.\r\nHis eyes stared at the ceiling.  And suddenly they closed.  Comrade\r\nOssipon slept in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enormous iron padlock on the doors of the wall cupboard was the only\r\nobject in the room on which the eye could rest without becoming afflicted\r\nby the miserable unloveliness of forms and the poverty of material.\r\nUnsaleable in the ordinary course of business on account of its noble\r\nproportions, it had been ceded to the Professor for a few pence by a\r\nmarine dealer in the east of London.  The room was large, clean,\r\nrespectable, and poor with that poverty suggesting the starvation of\r\nevery human need except mere bread.  There was nothing on the walls but\r\nthe paper, an expanse of arsenical green, soiled with indelible smudges\r\nhere and there, and with stains resembling faded maps of uninhabited\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nAt a deal table near a window sat Comrade Ossipon, holding his head\r\nbetween his fists.  The Professor, dressed in his only suit of shoddy\r\ntweeds, but flapping to and fro on the bare boards a pair of incredibly\r\ndilapidated slippers, had thrust his hands deep into the overstrained\r\npockets of his jacket.  He was relating to his robust guest a visit he\r\nhad lately been paying to the Apostle Michaelis.  The Perfect Anarchist\r\nhad even been unbending a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fellow didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything of Verloc\xe2\x80\x99s death.  Of course!  He never\r\nlooks at the newspapers.  They make him too sad, he says.  But never\r\nmind.  I walked into his cottage.  Not a soul anywhere.  I had to shout\r\nhalf-a-dozen times before he answered me.  I thought he was fast asleep\r\nyet, in bed.  But not at all.  He had been writing his book for four\r\nhours already.  He sat in that tiny cage in a litter of manuscript.\r\nThere was a half-eaten raw carrot on the table near him.  His breakfast.\r\nHe lives on a diet of raw carrots and a little milk now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does he look on it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Comrade Ossipon listlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngelic. . . . I picked up a handful of his pages from the floor.  The\r\npoverty of reasoning is astonishing.  He has no logic.  He can\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nconsecutively.  But that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.  He has divided his biography into\r\nthree parts, entitled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Faith, Hope, Charity.\xe2\x80\x99  He is elaborating now the\r\nidea of a world planned out like an immense and nice hospital, with\r\ngardens and flowers, in which the strong are to devote themselves to the\r\nnursing of the weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConceive you this folly, Ossipon?  The weak!  The source of all evil on\r\nthis earth!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued with his grim assurance.  \xe2\x80\x9cI told him that I\r\ndreamt of a world like shambles, where the weak would be taken in hand\r\nfor utter extermination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand, Ossipon?  The source of all evil!  They are our\r\nsinister masters\xe2\x80\x94the weak, the flabby, the silly, the cowardly, the faint\r\nof heart, and the slavish of mind.  They have power.  They are the\r\nmultitude.  Theirs is the kingdom of the earth.  Exterminate,\r\nexterminate!  That is the only way of progress.  It is!  Follow me,\r\nOssipon.  First the great multitude of the weak must go, then the only\r\nrelatively strong.  You see?  First the blind, then the deaf and the\r\ndumb, then the halt and the lame\xe2\x80\x94and so on.  Every taint, every vice,\r\nevery prejudice, every convention must meet its doom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what remains?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ossipon in a stifled voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remain\xe2\x80\x94if I am strong enough,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted the sallow little Professor,\r\nwhose large ears, thin like membranes, and standing far out from the\r\nsides of his frail skull, took on suddenly a deep red tint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I suffered enough from this oppression of the weak?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued forcibly.  Then tapping the breast-pocket of his jacket: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyet _I am_ the force,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut the time!  The time!  Give me\r\ntime!  Ah! that multitude, too stupid to feel either pity or fear.\r\nSometimes I think they have everything on their side.  Everything\xe2\x80\x94even\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x94my own weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and drink some beer with me at the Silenus,\xe2\x80\x9d said the robust\r\nOssipon after an interval of silence pervaded by the rapid flap, flap of\r\nthe slippers on the feet of the Perfect Anarchist.  This last accepted.\r\nHe was jovial that day in his own peculiar way.  He slapped Ossipon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeer!  So be it!  Let us drink and be merry, for we are strong, and\r\nto-morrow we die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe busied himself with putting on his boots, and talked meanwhile in his\r\ncurt, resolute tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you, Ossipon?  You look glum and seek even my\r\ncompany.  I hear that you are seen constantly in places where men utter\r\nfoolish things over glasses of liquor.  Why?  Have you abandoned your\r\ncollection of women?  They are the weak who feed the strong\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stamped one foot, and picked up his other laced boot, heavy,\r\nthick-soled, unblacked, mended many times.  He smiled to himself grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Ossipon, terrible man, has ever one of your victims killed\r\nherself for you\xe2\x80\x94or are your triumphs so far incomplete\xe2\x80\x94for blood alone\r\nputs a seal on greatness?  Blood.  Death.  Look at history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou be damned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon, without turning his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?  Let that be the hope of the weak, whose theology has invented hell\r\nfor the strong.  Ossipon, my feeling for you is amicable contempt.  You\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill a fly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut rolling to the feast on the top of the omnibus the Professor lost his\r\nhigh spirits.  The contemplation of the multitudes thronging the\r\npavements extinguished his assurance under a load of doubt and uneasiness\r\nwhich he could only shake off after a period of seclusion in the room\r\nwith the large cupboard closed by an enormous padlock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d said over his shoulder Comrade Ossipon, who sat on the seat\r\nbehind.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so Michaelis dreams of a world like a beautiful and cheery\r\nhospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so.  An immense charity for the healing of the weak,\xe2\x80\x9d assented the\r\nProfessor sardonically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s silly,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Ossipon.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t heal weakness.  But after\r\nall Michaelis may not be so far wrong.  In two hundred years doctors will\r\nrule the world.  Science reigns already.  It reigns in the shade\r\nmaybe\xe2\x80\x94but it reigns.  And all science must culminate at last in the\r\nscience of healing\xe2\x80\x94not the weak, but the strong.  Mankind wants to\r\nlive\xe2\x80\x94to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMankind,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted the Professor with a self-confident glitter of his\r\niron-rimmed spectacles, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not know what it wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you do,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Ossipon.  \xe2\x80\x9cJust now you\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying for\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94time.  Well.  The doctors will serve you out your time\xe2\x80\x94if you are\r\ngood.  You profess yourself to be one of the strong\xe2\x80\x94because you carry in\r\nyour pocket enough stuff to send yourself and, say, twenty other people\r\ninto eternity.  But eternity is a damned hole.  It\xe2\x80\x99s time that you need.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x94if you met a man who could give you for certain ten years of time,\r\nyou would call him your master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy device is: No God!  No Master,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Professor sententiously as\r\nhe rose to get off the \xe2\x80\x99bus.\r\n\r\nOssipon followed.  \xe2\x80\x9cWait till you are lying flat on your back at the end\r\nof your time,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, jumping off the footboard after the other.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour scurvy, shabby, mangy little bit of time,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued across the\r\nstreet, and hopping on to the curbstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOssipon, I think that you are a humbug,\xe2\x80\x9d the Professor said, opening\r\nmasterfully the doors of the renowned Silenus.  And when they had\r\nestablished themselves at a little table he developed further this\r\ngracious thought.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not even a doctor.  But you are funny.  Your\r\nnotion of a humanity universally putting out the tongue and taking the\r\npill from pole to pole at the bidding of a few solemn jokers is worthy of\r\nthe prophet.  Prophecy!  What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of thinking of what will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe raised his glass.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo the destruction of what is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said calmly.\r\n\r\nHe drank and relapsed into his peculiarly close manner of silence.  The\r\nthought of a mankind as numerous as the sands of the sea-shore, as\r\nindestructible, as difficult to handle, oppressed him.  The sound of\r\nexploding bombs was lost in their immensity of passive grains without an\r\necho.  For instance, this Verloc affair.  Who thought of it now?\r\n\r\nOssipon, as if suddenly compelled by some mysterious force, pulled a\r\nmuch-folded newspaper out of his pocket.  The Professor raised his head at\r\nthe rustle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that paper?  Anything in it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nOssipon started like a scared somnambulist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.  Nothing whatever.  The thing\xe2\x80\x99s ten days old.  I forgot it in\r\nmy pocket, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he did not throw the old thing away.  Before returning it to his\r\npocket he stole a glance at the last lines of a paragraph.  They ran\r\nthus: \xe2\x80\x9c_An impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever over this\r\nact of madness or despair_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the end words of an item of news headed: \xe2\x80\x9cSuicide of Lady\r\nPassenger from a cross-Channel Boat.\xe2\x80\x9d  Comrade Ossipon was familiar with\r\nthe beauties of its journalistic style.  \xe2\x80\x9c_An impenetrable mystery seems\r\ndestined to hang for ever_. . . . \xe2\x80\x9d  He knew every word by heart.  \xe2\x80\x9c_An\r\nimpenetrable mystery_. . . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the robust anarchist, hanging his head on his breast, fell into a\r\nlong reverie.\r\n\r\nHe was menaced by this thing in the very sources of his existence.  He\r\ncould not issue forth to meet his various conquests, those that he\r\ncourted on benches in Kensington Gardens, and those he met near area\r\nrailings, without the dread of beginning to talk to them of an\r\nimpenetrable mystery destined. . . . He was becoming scientifically\r\nafraid of insanity lying in wait for him amongst these lines.  \xe2\x80\x9c_To hang\r\nfor ever over_.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was an obsession, a torture.  He had lately failed\r\nto keep several of these appointments, whose note used to be an unbounded\r\ntrustfulness in the language of sentiment and manly tenderness.  The\r\nconfiding disposition of various classes of women satisfied the needs of\r\nhis self-love, and put some material means into his hand.  He needed it\r\nto live.  It was there.  But if he could no longer make use of it, he ran\r\nthe risk of starving his ideals and his body . . . \xe2\x80\x9c_This act of madness\r\nor despair_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn impenetrable mystery\xe2\x80\x9d was sure \xe2\x80\x9cto hang for ever\xe2\x80\x9d as far as all\r\nmankind was concerned.  But what of that if he alone of all men could\r\nnever get rid of the cursed knowledge?  And Comrade Ossipon\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge\r\nwas as precise as the newspaper man could make it\xe2\x80\x94up to the very\r\nthreshold of the \xe2\x80\x9c_mystery destined to hang for ever_. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nComrade Ossipon was well informed.  He knew what the gangway man of the\r\nsteamer had seen: \xe2\x80\x9cA lady in a black dress and a black veil, wandering at\r\nmidnight alongside, on the quay.  \xe2\x80\x98Are you going by the boat, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nhad asked her encouragingly.  \xe2\x80\x98This way.\xe2\x80\x99  She seemed not to know what to\r\ndo.  He helped her on board.  She seemed weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he knew also what the stewardess had seen: A lady in black with a\r\nwhite face standing in the middle of the empty ladies\xe2\x80\x99 cabin.  The\r\nstewardess induced her to lie down there.  The lady seemed quite\r\nunwilling to speak, and as if she were in some awful trouble.  The next\r\nthe stewardess knew she was gone from the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 cabin.  The stewardess\r\nthen went on deck to look for her, and Comrade Ossipon was informed that\r\nthe good woman found the unhappy lady lying down in one of the hooded\r\nseats.  Her eyes were open, but she would not answer anything that was\r\nsaid to her.  She seemed very ill.  The stewardess fetched the chief\r\nsteward, and those two people stood by the side of the hooded seat\r\nconsulting over their extraordinary and tragic passenger.  They talked in\r\naudible whispers (for she seemed past hearing) of St Malo and the Consul\r\nthere, of communicating with her people in England.  Then they went away\r\nto arrange for her removal down below, for indeed by what they could see\r\nof her face she seemed to them to be dying.  But Comrade Ossipon knew\r\nthat behind that white mask of despair there was struggling against\r\nterror and despair a vigour of vitality, a love of life that could resist\r\nthe furious anguish which drives to murder and the fear, the blind, mad\r\nfear of the gallows.  He knew.  But the stewardess and the chief steward\r\nknew nothing, except that when they came back for her in less than five\r\nminutes the lady in black was no longer in the hooded seat.  She was\r\nnowhere.  She was gone.  It was then five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and it\r\nwas no accident either.  An hour afterwards one of the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\nfound a wedding ring left lying on the seat.  It had stuck to the wood in\r\na bit of wet, and its glitter caught the man\xe2\x80\x99s eye.  There was a date,\r\n24th June 1879, engraved inside.  \xe2\x80\x9c_An impenetrable mystery is destined\r\nto hang for ever_. . . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Comrade Ossipon raised his bowed head, beloved of various humble\r\nwomen of these isles, Apollo-like in the sunniness of its bush of hair.\r\n\r\nThe Professor had grown restless meantime.  He rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon hurriedly.  \xe2\x80\x9cHere, what do you know of madness and\r\ndespair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor passed the tip of his tongue on his dry, thin lips, and\r\nsaid doctorally:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no such things.  All passion is lost now.  The world is\r\nmediocre, limp, without force.  And madness and despair are a force.  And\r\nforce is a crime in the eyes of the fools, the weak and the silly who\r\nrule the roost.  You are mediocre.  Verloc, whose affair the police has\r\nmanaged to smother so nicely, was mediocre.  And the police murdered him.\r\nHe was mediocre.  Everybody is mediocre.  Madness and despair!  Give me\r\nthat for a lever, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll move the world.  Ossipon, you have my cordial\r\nscorn.  You are incapable of conceiving even what the fat-fed citizen\r\nwould call a crime.  You have no force.\xe2\x80\x9d  He paused, smiling sardonically\r\nunder the fierce glitter of his thick glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd let me tell you that this little legacy they say you\xe2\x80\x99ve come into\r\nhas not improved your intelligence.  You sit at your beer like a dummy.\r\nGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ossipon, looking up with an idiotic grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe legacy.  All of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe incorruptible Professor only smiled.  His clothes were all but\r\nfalling off him, his boots, shapeless with repairs, heavy like lead, let\r\nwater in at every step.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will send you by-and-by a small bill for certain chemicals which I\r\nshall order to-morrow.  I need them badly.  Understood\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOssipon lowered his head slowly.  He was alone.  \xe2\x80\x9c_An impenetrable\r\nmystery_. . . . \xe2\x80\x9d  It seemed to him that suspended in the air before him\r\nhe saw his own brain pulsating to the rhythm of an impenetrable mystery.\r\nIt was diseased clearly. . . .  \xe2\x80\x9c_This act of madness or despair_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mechanical piano near the door played through a valse cheekily, then\r\nfell silent all at once, as if gone grumpy.\r\n\r\nComrade Ossipon, nicknamed the Doctor, went out of the Silenus beer-hall.\r\nAt the door he hesitated, blinking at a not too splendid sunlight\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\npaper with the report of the suicide of a lady was in his pocket.  His\r\nheart was beating against it.  The suicide of a lady\xe2\x80\x94_this act of madness\r\nor despair_.\r\n\r\nHe walked along the street without looking where he put his feet; and he\r\nwalked in a direction which would not bring him to the place of\r\nappointment with another lady (an elderly nursery governess putting her\r\ntrust in an Apollo-like ambrosial head).  He was walking away from it.\r\nHe could face no woman.  It was ruin.  He could neither think, work,\r\nsleep, nor eat.  But he was beginning to drink with pleasure, with\r\nanticipation, with hope.  It was ruin.  His revolutionary career,\r\nsustained by the sentiment and trustfulness of many women, was menaced by\r\nan impenetrable mystery\xe2\x80\x94the mystery of a human brain pulsating wrongfully\r\nto the rhythm of journalistic phrases.  \xe2\x80\x9c . . . _Will hang for ever over\r\nthis act_. . . . It was inclining towards the gutter . . . _of madness or\r\ndespair_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am seriously ill,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself with scientific insight.\r\nAlready his robust form, with an Embassy\xe2\x80\x99s secret-service money\r\n(inherited from Mr Verloc) in his pockets, was marching in the gutter as\r\nif in training for the task of an inevitable future.  Already he bowed\r\nhis broad shoulders, his head of ambrosial locks, as if ready to receive\r\nthe leather yoke of the sandwich board.  As on that night, more than a\r\nweek ago, Comrade Ossipon walked without looking where he put his feet,\r\nfeeling no fatigue, feeling nothing, seeing nothing, hearing not a sound.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_An impenetrable mystery_. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  He walked disregarded. . . .  \xe2\x80\x9c_This\r\nact of madness or despair_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the incorruptible Professor walked too, averting his eyes from the\r\nodious multitude of mankind.  He had no future.  He disdained it.  He was\r\na force.  His thoughts caressed the images of ruin and destruction.  He\r\nwalked frail, insignificant, shabby, miserable\xe2\x80\x94and terrible in the\r\nsimplicity of his idea calling madness and despair to the regeneration of\r\nthe world.  Nobody looked at him.  He passed on unsuspected and deadly,\r\nlike a pest in the street full of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SECRET AGENT ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
