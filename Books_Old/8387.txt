Knopf, Inc.\r\nThis edition is a bowdlerised version of the original 1899 translation,\r\nalso by George Egerton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Knut Hamsun\r\n\r\n  Since the death of Ibsen and Strindberg, Hamsun is undoubtedly the\r\n  foremost creative writer of the Scandinavian countries. Those\r\n  approaching most nearly to his position are probably Selma Lagerl\xc3\xb6f in\r\n  Sweden and Henrik Pontoppidan in Denmark. Both these, however, seem to\r\n  have less than he of that width of outlook, validity of interpretation\r\n  and authority of tone that made the greater masters what they were.\r\n\r\n  His reputation is not confined to his own country or the two\r\n  Scandinavian sister nations. It spread long ago over the rest of Europe,\r\n  taking deepest roots in Russia, where several editions of his collected\r\n  works have already appeared, and where he is spoken of as the equal of\r\n  Tolstoy and Dostoyevski. The enthusiasm of this approval is a\r\n  characteristic symptom that throws interesting light on Russia as well\r\n  as on Hamsun.\r\n\r\n  Hearing of it, one might expect him to prove a man of the masses, full\r\n  of keen social consciousness. Instead, he must be classed as an\r\n  individualistic romanticist and a highly subjective aristocrat, whose\r\n  foremost passion in life is violent, defiant deviation from everything\r\n  average and ordinary. He fears and flouts the dominance of the many, and\r\n  his heroes, who are nothing but slightly varied images of himself, are\r\n  invariably marked by an originality of speech and action that brings\r\n  them close to, if not across, the borderline of the eccentric.\r\n\r\n  In all the literature known to me, there is no writer who appears more\r\n  ruthlessly and fearlessly himself, and the self thus presented to us is\r\n  as paradoxical and rebellious as it is poetic and picturesque. Such a\r\n  nature, one would think, must be the final blossoming of powerful\r\n  hereditary tendencies, converging silently through numerous generations\r\n  to its predestined climax. All we know is that Hamsun\'s forebears were\r\n  sturdy Norwegian peasant folk, said only to be differentiated from their\r\n  neighbours by certain artistic preoccupations that turned one or two of\r\n  them into skilled craftsmen. More certain it is that what may or may not\r\n  have been innate was favoured and fostered and exaggerated by physical\r\n  environment and early social experiences.\r\n\r\n  Hamsun was born on Aug. 4, 1860, in one of the sunny valleys of central\r\n  Norway. From there his parents moved when he was only four to settle in\r\n  the far northern district of Lofoden--that land of extremes, where the\r\n  year, and not the day, is evenly divided between darkness and light;\r\n  where winter is a long dreamless sleep, and summer a passionate dream\r\n  without sleep; where land and sea meet and intermingle so gigantically\r\n  that man is all but crushed between the two--or else raised to titanic\r\n  measures by the spectacle of their struggle.\r\n\r\n  The Northland, with its glaring lights and black shadows, its unearthly\r\n  joys and abysmal despairs, is present and dominant in every line that\r\n  Hamsun ever wrote. In that country his best tales and dramas are laid.\r\n  By that country his heroes are stamped wherever they roam. Out of that\r\n  country they draw their principal claims to probability. Only in that\r\n  country do they seem quite at home. Today we know, however, that the\r\n  pathological case represents nothing but an extension of perfectly\r\n  normal tendencies. In the same way we know that the miraculous\r\n  atmosphere of the Northland serves merely to develop and emphasize\r\n  traits that lie slumbering in men and women everywhere. And on this\r\n  basis the fantastic figures created by Hamsun relate themselves to\r\n  ordinary humanity as the microscopic enlargement of a cross section to\r\n  the living tissues. What we see is true in everything but proportion.\r\n\r\n  The artist and the vagabond seem equally to have been in the blood of\r\n  Hamsun from the very start. Apprenticed to a shoemaker, he used his\r\n  scant savings to arrange for the private printing of a long poem and a\r\n  short novel produced at the age of eighteen, when he was still signing\r\n  himself Knud Pedersen Hamsund. This done, he abruptly quit his\r\n  apprenticeship and entered on that period of restless roving through\r\n  trades and continents which lasted until his first real artistic\r\n  achievement with "Hunger," In 1888-90. It has often been noted that\r\n  practically every one of Hamsun\'s heroes is of the same age as he was\r\n  then, and that their creator takes particular pain to accentuate this\r\n  fact. It is almost as if, during those days of feverish literary\r\n  struggle, he had risen to heights where he saw things so clearly that\r\n  no subsequent experience could add anything but occasional details.\r\n\r\n  Before he reached those heights, he had tried life as coal-heaver and\r\n  school teacher, as road-mender and surveyor\'s attendant, as farm hand\r\n  and streetcar conductor, as lecturer and free-lance journalist, as\r\n  tourist and emigrant. Twice he visited this country during the middle\r\n  eighties, working chiefly on the plains of North Dakota and in the\r\n  streets of Chicago. Twice during that time he returned to his own\r\n  country and passed through the experiences pictured in "Hunger," before,\r\n  at last, he found his own literary self and thus also a hearing from the\r\n  world at large. While here, he failed utterly to establish any\r\n  sympathetic contact between himself and the new world, and his first\r\n  book after his return in 1888 was a volume of studies named "The\r\n  Spiritual Life of Modern America," which a prominent Norwegian critic\r\n  once described as "a masterpiece of distorted criticism." But I own a\r\n  copy of this book, the fly-leaf of which bears the following inscription\r\n  in the author\'s autograph:\r\n\r\n      "A youthful work. It has ceased to represent my opinion of America.\r\n      May 28, 1903. Knut Hamsun."\r\n\r\n  In its original form, "Hunger" was merely a sketch, and as such it\r\n  appeared in 1888 in a Danish literary periodical, "New Earth." It\r\n  attracted immediate widespread attention to the author, both on account\r\n  of its unusual theme and striking form. It was a new kind of realism\r\n  that had nothing to do with photographic reproduction of details. It was\r\n  a professedly psychological study that had about as much in common with\r\n  the old-fashioned conceptions of man\'s mental activities as the\r\n  delirious utterances of a fever patient. It was life, but presented in\r\n  the Impressionistic temper of a Gauguin or Cezanne. On the appearance of\r\n  the completed novel in 1890, Hamsun was greeted as one of the chief\r\n  heralds of the neo-romantic movement then spreading rapidly through the\r\n  Scandinavian north and finding typical expressions not only in the works\r\n  of theretofore unknown writers, but in the changed moods of masters like\r\n  Ibsen and Bjornson and Strindberg.\r\n\r\n  It was followed two years later by "Mysteries," which pretends to be a\r\n  novel, but which may be better described as a delightfully irresponsible\r\n  and defiantly subjective roaming through any highway or byway of life or\r\n  letters that happened to take the author\'s fancy at the moment of\r\n  writing. Some one has said of that book that in its abrupt swingings\r\n  from laughter to tears, from irreverence to awe, from the ridiculous to\r\n  the sublime, one finds the spirits of Dostoyevski and Mark Twain\r\n  blended.\r\n\r\n  The novels "Editor Lynge" and "New Earth," both published in 1893, were\r\n  social studies of Christiania\'s Bohemia and chiefly characterized by\r\n  their violent attacks on the men and women exercising the profession\r\n  which Hamsun had just made his own. Then came "Pan" in 1894, and the\r\n  real Hamsun, the Hamsun who ever since has moved logically and with\r\n  increasing authority to "The Growth of the Soil," stood finally\r\n  revealed. It is a novel of the Northland, almost without a plot, and\r\n  having its chief interest in a primitively spontaneous man\'s reactions\r\n  to a nature so overwhelming that it makes mere purposeless existence\r\n  seem a sufficient end in itself. One may well question whether Hamsun\r\n  has ever surpassed the purely lyrical mood of that book, into which he\r\n  poured the ecstatic dreams of the little boy from the south as, for the\r\n  first time, he saw the forestclad northern mountains bathing their feet\r\n  in the ocean and their crowns in the light of a never-setting sun. It is\r\n  a wonderful paean to untamed nature and to the forces let loose by it\r\n  within the soul of man.\r\n\r\n  Like most of the great writers over there, Hamsun has not confined\r\n  himself to one poetic mood or form, but has tried all of them. From the\r\n  line of novels culminating in "Pan," he turned suddenly to the drama,\r\n  and in 1895 appeared his first play, "At the Gates of the Kingdom." It\r\n  was the opening drama of a trilogy and was followed by "The Game of\r\n  Life" in 1896 and "Sunset Glow" in 1898. The first play is laid in\r\n  Christiania, the second in the Northland, and the third in Christiania\r\n  again. The hero of all three is Ivar Kareno, a student and thinker who\r\n  is first presented to us at the age of 29, then at 39, and finally at\r\n  50. His wife and several other characters accompany the central figure\r\n  through the trilogy, of which the lesson seems to be that every one is\r\n  a rebel at 30 and a renegade at 50. But when Kareno, the irreconcilable\r\n  rebel of "At the Gates of the Kingdom," the heaven-storming truth-seeker\r\n  of "The Game of Life," and the acclaimed radical leader in the first\r\n  acts of "Sunset Glow," surrenders at last to the powers that be in order\r\n  to gain a safe and sheltered harbor for his declining years, then\r\n  another man of 29 stands ready to denounce him and to take up the rebel\r\n  cry of youth to which he has become a traitor. Hamsun\'s ironical humor\r\n  and whimsical manner of expression do more than the plot itself to knit\r\n  the plays into an organic unit, and several of the characters are\r\n  delightfully drawn, particularly the two women who play the greatest\r\n  part in Kareno\'s life: his wife Eline, and Teresita, who is one more\r\n  of his many feminine embodiments of the passionate and changeable\r\n  Northland nature. Any attempt to give a political tendency to the\r\n  trilogy must be held wasted. Characteristically, Kareno is a sort of\r\n  Nietzschean rebel against the victorious majority, and Hamsun\'s\r\n  seemingly cynical conclusions stress man\'s capacity for action\r\n  rather than the purposes toward which that capacity may be directed.\r\n\r\n  Of three subsequent plays, "Vendt the Monk," (1903), "Queen Tamara"\r\n  (1903) and "At the Mercy of Life" (1910), the first mentioned is by far\r\n  the most remarkable. It is a verse drama in eight acts, centred about\r\n  one of Hamsun\'s most typical vagabond heroes. The monk Vendt has much\r\n  in common with Peer Gynt without being in any way an imitation or a\r\n  duplicate. He is a dreamer in revolt against the world\'s alleged\r\n  injustice, a rebel against the very powers that invisibly move the\r\n  universe, and a passionate lover of life who in the end accepts it as\r\n  a joyful battle and then dreams of the long peace to come. The vigor\r\n  and charm of the verse proved a surprise to the critics when the play\r\n  was published, as Hamsun until then had given no proof of any poetic\r\n  gift in the narrower sense.\r\n\r\n  From 1897 to 1912 Hamsun produced a series of volumes that simply marked\r\n  a further development of the tendencies shown in his first novels:\r\n  "Siesta," short stories, 1897; "Victoria" a novel with a charming love\r\n  story that embodies the tenderest note in his production, 1898; "In\r\n  Wonderland," travelling sketches from the Caucasus, 1903; "Brushwood,"\r\n  short stories, 1903; "The Wild Choir," a collection of poems, 1904;\r\n  "Dreamers," a novel, 1904; "Struggling Life," short stories and\r\n  travelling sketches, 1905; "Beneath the Autumn Star" a novel, 1906;\r\n  "Benoni," and "Rosa," two novels forming to some extent sequels to\r\n  "Pan," 1908; "A Wanderer Plays with Muted Strings," a novel, 1909;\r\n  and "The Last Joy," a shapeless work, half novel and half mere\r\n  uncoordinated reflections, 1912.\r\n\r\n  The later part of this output seemed to indicate a lack of development,\r\n  a failure to open up new vistas, that caused many to fear that the\r\n  principal contributions of Hamsun already lay behind him. Then appeared\r\n  in 1913 a big novel, "Children of the Time," which in many ways struck\r\n  a new note, although led up to by "Rosa" and "Benoni." The horizon is\r\n  now wider, the picture broader. There is still a central figure, and\r\n  still he possesses many of the old Hamsun traits, but he has crossed the\r\n  meridian at last and become an observer rather than a fighter and doer.\r\n  Nor is he the central figure to the same extent as Lieutenant Glahn in\r\n  "Pan" or Kareno in the trilogy. The life pictured is the life of a\r\n  certain spot of ground--Segelfoss manor, and later the town of\r\n  Segelfoss--rather than that of one or two isolated individuals. One\r\n  might almost say that Hamsun\'s vision has become social at last, were it\r\n  not for his continued accentuation of the irreconcilable conflict\r\n  between the individual and the group.\r\n\r\n  "Segelfoss Town" in 1915 and "The Growth of the Soil"--the title ought\r\n  to be "The Earth\'s Increase"--in 1918 continue along the path Hamsun\r\n  entered by "Children of the Time." The scene is laid in his beloved\r\n  Northland, but the old primitive life is going--going even in the\r\n  outlying districts, where the pioneers are already breaking ground for\r\n  new permanent settlements. Business of a modern type has arrived, and\r\n  much of the quiet humor displayed in these the latest and maturest of\r\n  Hamsun\'s works springs from the spectacle of its influence on the\r\n  natives, whose hands used always to be in their pockets, and whose\r\n  credulity in face of the improbable was only surpassed by their\r\n  unwillingness to believe anything reasonable. Still the life he\r\n  pictures is largely primitive, with nature as man\'s chief antagonist,\r\n  and to us of the crowded cities it brings a charm of novelty rarely\r\n  found in books today. With it goes an understanding of human nature\r\n  which is no less deep-reaching because it is apt to find expression in\r\n  whimsical or flagrantly paradoxical forms.\r\n\r\n  Hamsun has just celebrated his sixtieth birthday anniversary. He is as\r\n  strong and active as ever, burying himself most of the time on his\r\n  little estate in the heart of the country that has become to such a\r\n  peculiar extent his own. There is every reason to expect from him works\r\n  that may not only equal but surpass the best of his production so far.\r\n  But even if such expectations should prove false, the body of his work\r\n  already accomplished is such, both in quantity and quality, that he must\r\n  perforce be placed in the very front rank of the world\'s living writers.\r\n  To the English-speaking world he has so far been made known only through\r\n  the casual publication at long intervals of a few of his books:\r\n  "Hunger," "Fictoria" and "Shallow Soil" (rendered in the list above as\r\n  "New Earth"). There is now reason to believe that this negligence will\r\n  be remedied, and that soon the best of Hamsun\'s work will be available\r\n  in English. To the American and English publics it ought to prove a\r\n  welcome tonic because of its very divergence from what they commonly\r\n  feed on. And they may safely look to Hamsun as a thinker as well as a\r\n  poet and laughing dreamer, provided they realize from the start that his\r\n  thinking is suggestive rather than conclusive, and that he never meant\r\n  it to be anything else.\r\n\r\n  EDWIN BJ\xc3\x96RKMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during the time I wandered about and starved in Christiania:\r\nChristiania, this singular city, from which no man departs without\r\ncarrying away the traces of his sojourn there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was lying awake in my attic and I heard a clock below strike six. It\r\nwas already broad daylight, and people had begun to go up and down the\r\nstairs. By the door where the wall of the room was papered with old\r\nnumbers of the _Morgenbladet_, I could distinguish clearly a notice\r\nfrom the Director of Lighthouses, and a little to the left of that an\r\ninflated advertisement of Fabian Olsens\' new-baked bread.\r\n\r\nThe instant I opened my eyes I began, from sheer force of habit, to\r\nthink if I had anything to rejoice over that day. I had been somewhat\r\nhard-up lately, and one after the other of my belongings had been taken\r\nto my "Uncle." I had grown nervous and irritable. A few times I had\r\nkept my bed for the day with vertigo. Now and then, when luck had\r\nfavoured me, I had managed to get five shillings for a feuilleton from\r\nsome newspaper or other.\r\n\r\nIt grew lighter and lighter, and I took to reading the advertisements\r\nnear the door. I could even make out the grinning lean letters of\r\n"winding-sheets to be had at Miss Andersen\'s" on the right of it. That\r\noccupied me for a long while. I heard the clock below strike eight as I\r\ngot up and put on my clothes.\r\n\r\nI opened the window and looked out. From where I was standing I had a\r\nview of a clothes-line and an open field. Farther away lay the ruins\r\nof a burnt-out smithy, which some labourers were busy clearing away. I\r\nleant with my elbows resting on the window-frame and gazed into open\r\nspace. It promised to be a clear day--autumn, that tender, cool time of\r\nthe year, when all things change their colour, and die, had come to us.\r\nThe ever-increasing noise in the streets lured me out. The bare room,\r\nthe floor of which rocked up and down with every step I took across it,\r\nseemed like a gasping, sinister coffin. There was no proper fastening\r\nto the door, either, and no stove. I used to lie on my socks at night\r\nto dry them a little by the morning. The only thing I had to divert\r\nmyself with was a little red rocking-chair, in which I used to sit in\r\nthe evenings and doze and muse on all manner of things. When it blew\r\nhard, and the door below stood open, all kinds of eerie sounds moaned\r\nup through the floor and from out the walls, and the _Morgenbladet_\r\nnear the door was rent in strips a span long.\r\n\r\nI stood up and searched through a bundle in the corner by the bed for a\r\nbite for breakfast, but finding nothing, went back to the window.\r\n\r\nGod knows, thought I, if looking for employment will ever again avail\r\nme aught. The frequent repulses, half-promises, and curt noes, the\r\ncherished, deluded hopes, and fresh endeavours that always resulted in\r\nnothing had done my courage to death. As a last resource, I had applied\r\nfor a place as debt collector, but I was too late, and, besides, I\r\ncould not have found the fifty shillings demanded as security. There\r\nwas always something or another in my way. I had even offered to enlist\r\nin the Fire Brigade. There we stood and waited in the vestibule, some\r\nhalf-hundred men, thrusting our chests out to give an idea of strength\r\nand bravery, whilst an inspector walked up and down and scanned the\r\napplicants, felt their arms, and put one question or another to them.\r\nMe, he passed by, merely shaking his head, saying I was rejected on\r\naccount of my sight. I applied again without my glasses, stood there\r\nwith knitted brows, and made my eyes as sharp as needles, but the man\r\npassed me by again with a smile; he had recognized me. And, worse than\r\nall, I could no longer apply for a situation in the garb of a\r\nrespectable man.\r\n\r\nHow regularly and steadily things had gone downhill with me for a long\r\ntime, till, in the end, I was so curiously bared of every conceivable\r\nthing. I had not even a comb left, not even a book to read, when things\r\ngrew all too sad with me. All through the summer, up in the churchyards\r\nor parks, where I used to sit and write my articles for the newspapers,\r\nI had thought out column after column on the most miscellaneous\r\nsubjects. Strange ideas, quaint fancies, conceits of my restless brain;\r\nin despair I had often chosen the most remote themes, that cost me long\r\nhours of intense effort, and never were accepted. When one piece was\r\nfinished I set to work at another. I was not often discouraged by the\r\neditors\' "no." I used to tell myself constantly that some day I was\r\nbound to succeed; and really occasionally when I was in luck\'s way, and\r\nmade a hit with something, I could get five shillings for an\r\nafternoon\'s work.\r\n\r\nOnce again I raised myself from the window, went over to the\r\nwashing-stand, and sprinkled some water on the shiny knees of my\r\ntrousers to dull them a little and make them look a trifle newer.\r\nHaving done this, I pocketed paper and pencil as usual and went out. I\r\nstole very quietly down the stairs in order not to attract my\r\nlandlady\'s attention (a few days had elapsed since my rent had fallen\r\ndue, and I had no longer anything wherewith to raise it).\r\n\r\nIt was nine o\'clock. The roll of vehicles and hum of voices filled the\r\nair, a mighty morning-choir mingled with the footsteps of the\r\npedestrians, and the crack of the hack-drivers\' whips. The clamorous\r\ntraffic everywhere exhilarated me at once, and I began to feel more and\r\nmore contented. Nothing was farther from my intention than to merely\r\ntake a morning walk in the open air. What had the air to do with my\r\nlungs? I was strong as a giant; could stop a dray with my shoulders. A\r\nsweet, unwonted mood, a feeling of lightsome happy-go-luckiness took\r\npossession of me. I fell to observing the people I met and who passed\r\nme, to reading the placards on the wall, noted even the impression of a\r\nglance thrown at me from a passing tram-car, let each bagatelle, each\r\ntrifling incident that crossed or vanished from my path impress me.\r\n\r\nIf one only had just a little to eat on such a lightsome day! The sense\r\nof the glad morning overwhelmed me; my satisfaction became\r\nill-regulated, and for no definite reason I began to hum joyfully.\r\n\r\nAt a butcher\'s stall a woman stood speculating on sausage for dinner.\r\nAs I passed her she looked up at me. She had but one tooth in the front\r\nof her head. I had become so nervous and easily affected in the last\r\nfew days that the woman\'s face made a loathsome impression upon me. The\r\nlong yellow snag looked like a little finger pointing out of her gum,\r\nand her gaze was still full of sausage as she turned it upon me. I\r\nimmediately lost all appetite, and a feeling of nausea came over me.\r\nWhen I reached the market-place I went to the fountain and drank a\r\nlittle. I looked up; the dial marked ten on Our Saviour\'s tower.\r\n\r\nI went on through the streets, listlessly, without troubling myself\r\nabout anything at all, stopped aimlessly at a corner, turned off into a\r\nside street without having any errand there. I simply let myself go,\r\nwandered about in the pleasant morning, swinging myself care-free to\r\nand fro amongst other happy human beings. This air was clear and bright\r\nand my mind too was without a shadow.\r\n\r\nFor quite ten minutes I had had an old lame man ahead of me. He carried\r\na bundle in one hand and exerted his whole body, using all his strength\r\nin his endeavours to get along speedily. I could hear how he panted\r\nfrom the exertion, and it occurred to me that I might offer to bear his\r\nbundle for him, but yet I made no effort to overtake him. Up in\r\nGraendsen I met Hans Pauli, who nodded and hurried past me. Why was he\r\nin such a hurry? I had not the slightest intention of asking him for a\r\nshilling, and, more than that, I intended at the very first opportunity\r\nto return him a blanket which I had borrowed from him some weeks before.\r\n\r\nJust wait until I could get my foot on the ladder, I would be beholden\r\nto no man, not even for a blanket. Perhaps even this very day I might\r\ncommence an article on the "Crimes of Futurity," "Freedom of Will," or\r\nwhat not, at any rate, something worth reading, something for which I\r\nwould at least get ten shillings.... And at the thought of this article\r\nI felt myself fired with a desire to set to work immediately and to\r\ndraw from the contents of my overflowing brain. I would find a suitable\r\nplace to write in the park and not rest until I had completed my\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nBut the old cripple was still making the same sprawling movements ahead\r\nof me up the street. The sight of this infirm creature constantly in\r\nfront of me, commenced to irritate me--his journey seemed endless;\r\nperhaps he had made up his mind to go to exactly the same place as I\r\nhad, and I must needs have him before my eyes the whole way. In my\r\nirritation it seemed to me that he slackened his pace a little at every\r\ncross street, as if waiting to see which direction I intended to take,\r\nupon which he would again swing his bundle in the air and peg away with\r\nall his might to keep ahead of me. I follow and watch this tiresome\r\ncreature and get more and more exasperated with him, I am conscious\r\nthat he has, little by little, destroyed my happy mood and dragged the\r\npure, beautiful morning down to the level of his own ugliness. He looks\r\nlike a great sprawling reptile striving with might and main to win a\r\nplace in the world and reserve the footpath for himself. When we\r\nreached the top of the hill I determined to put up with it no longer. I\r\nturned to a shop window and stopped in order to give him an opportunity\r\nof getting ahead, but when, after a lapse of some minutes, I again\r\nwalked on there was the man still in front of me--he too had stood\r\nstock still,--without stopping to reflect I made three or four furious\r\nonward strides, caught him up, and slapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe stopped directly, and we both stared at one another fixedly. "A\r\nhalfpenny for milk!" he whined, twisting his head askew.\r\n\r\nSo that was how the wind blew. I felt in my pockets and said: "For\r\nmilk, eh? Hum-m--money\'s scarce these times, and I don\'t really know\r\nhow much you are in need of it."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t eaten a morsel since yesterday in Drammen; I haven\'t got a\r\nfarthing, nor have I got any work yet!"\r\n\r\n"Are you an artisan?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; a binder."\r\n\r\n"A what?"\r\n\r\n"A shoe-binder; for that matter, I can make shoes too."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that alters the case," said I, "you wait here for some minutes\r\nand I shall go and get a little money for you; just a few pence."\r\n\r\nI hurried as fast as I could down Pyle Street, where I knew of a\r\npawnbroker on a second-floor (one, besides, to whom I had never been\r\nbefore). When I got inside the hall I hastily took off my waistcoat,\r\nrolled it up, and put it under my arm; after which I went upstairs and\r\nknocked at the office door. I bowed on entering, and threw the\r\nwaistcoat on the counter.\r\n\r\n"One-and-six," said the man.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, thanks," I replied. "If it weren\'t that it was beginning to\r\nbe a little tight for me, of course I wouldn\'t part with it."\r\n\r\nI got the money and the ticket, and went back. Considering all things,\r\npawning that waistcoat was a capital notion. I would have money enough\r\nover for a plentiful breakfast, and before evening my thesis on the\r\n"Crimes of Futurity" would be ready. I began to find existence more\r\nalluring; and I hurried back to the man to get rid of him.\r\n\r\n"There it is," said I. "I am glad you applied to me first."\r\n\r\nThe man took the money and scrutinized me closely. At what was he\r\nstanding there staring? I had a feeling that he particularly examined\r\nthe knees of my trousers, and his shameless effrontery bored me. Did\r\nthe scoundrel imagine that I really was as poor as I looked? Had I not\r\nas good as begun to write an article for half-a-sovereign? Besides, I\r\nhad no fear whatever for the future. I had many irons in the fire. What\r\non earth business was it of an utter stranger if I chose to stand him a\r\ndrink on such a lovely day? The man\'s look annoyed me, and I made up my\r\nmind to give him a good dressing-down before I left him. I threw back\r\nmy shoulders, and said:\r\n\r\n"My good fellow, you have adopted a most unpleasant habit of staring at\r\na man\'s knees when he gives you a shilling."\r\n\r\nHe leant his head back against the wall and opened his mouth widely;\r\nsomething was working in that empty pate of his, and he evidently came\r\nto the conclusion that I meant to best him in some way, for he handed\r\nme back the money. I stamped on the pavement, and, swearing at him,\r\ntold him to keep it. Did he imagine I was going to all that trouble for\r\nnothing? If all came to all, perhaps I owed him this shilling; I had\r\njust recollected an old debt; he was standing before an honest man,\r\nhonourable to his finger-tips--in short, the money was his. Oh, no\r\nthanks were needed; it had been a pleasure to me. Good-bye!\r\n\r\nI went on. At last I was freed from this work-ridden plague, and I\r\ncould go my way in peace. I turned down Pyle Street again, and stopped\r\nbefore a grocer\'s shop. The whole window was filled with eatables, and\r\nI decided to go in and get something to take with me.\r\n\r\n"A piece of cheese and a French roll," I said, and threw my sixpence on\r\nto the counter.\r\n\r\n"Bread and cheese for the whole of it?" asked the woman ironically,\r\nwithout looking up at me.\r\n\r\n"For the whole sixpence? Yes," I answered, unruffled.\r\n\r\nI took them up, bade the fat old woman good-morning, with the utmost\r\npoliteness, and sped, full tilt, up Castle Hill to the park.\r\n\r\nI found a bench to myself, and began to bite greedily into my\r\nprovender. It did me good; it was a long time since I had had such a\r\nsquare meal, and, by degrees, I felt the same sated quiet steal over me\r\nthat one feels after a good long cry. My courage rose mightily. I could\r\nno longer be satisfied with writing an article about anything so simple\r\nand straight-ahead as the "Crimes of Futurity," that any ass might\r\narrive at, ay, simply deduct from history. I felt capable of a much\r\ngreater effort than that; I was in a fitting mood to overcome\r\ndifficulties, and I decided on a treatise, in three sections, on\r\n"Philosophical Cognition." This would, naturally, give me an\r\nopportunity of crushing pitiably some of Kant\'s sophistries ... but, on\r\ntaking out my writing materials to commence work, I discovered that I\r\nno longer owned a pencil: I had forgotten it in the pawn-office. My\r\npencil was lying in my waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nGood Lord! how everything seems to take a delight in thwarting me\r\ntoday! I swore a few times, rose from the seat, and took a couple of\r\nturns up and down the path. It was very quiet all around me; down near\r\nthe Queen\'s arbour two nursemaids were trundling their perambulators;\r\notherwise, there was not a creature anywhere in sight. I was in a\r\nthoroughly embittered temper; I paced up and down before my seat like a\r\nmaniac. How strangely awry things seemed to go! To think that an\r\narticle in three sections should be downright stranded by the simple\r\nfact of my not having a pennyworth of pencil in my pocket. Supposing I\r\nwere to return to Pyle Street and ask to get my pencil back? There\r\nwould be still time to get a good piece finished before the promenading\r\npublic commenced to fill the parks. So much, too, depended on this\r\ntreatise on "Philosophical Cognition"--mayhap many human beings\'\r\nwelfare, no one could say; and I told myself it might be of the\r\ngreatest possible help to many young people. On second thoughts, I\r\nwould not lay violent hands on Kant; I might easily avoid doing that; I\r\nwould only need to make an almost imperceptible gliding over when I\r\ncame to query Time and Space; but I would not answer for Renan, old\r\nParson Renan....\r\n\r\nAt all events, an article of so-and-so many columns has to be\r\ncompleted. For the unpaid rent, and the landlady\'s inquiring look in\r\nthe morning when I met her on the stairs, tormented me the whole day;\r\nit rose up and confronted me again and again, even in my pleasant\r\nhours, when I had otherwise not a gloomy thought.\r\n\r\nI must put an end to it, so I left the park hurriedly to fetch my\r\npencil from the pawnbroker\'s.\r\n\r\nAs I arrived at the foot of the hill I overtook two ladies, whom I\r\npassed. As I did so, I brushed one of them accidentally on the arm. I\r\nlooked up; she had a full, rather pale, face. But she blushes, and,\r\nbecomes suddenly surprisingly lovely. I know not why she blushes; maybe\r\nat some word she hears from a passer-by, maybe only at some lurking\r\nthought of her own. Or can it be because I touched her arm? Her high,\r\nfull bosom heaves violently several times, and she closes her hand\r\ntightly above the handle of her parasol. What has come to her?\r\n\r\nI stopped, and let her pass ahead again. I could, for the moment, go no\r\nfurther; the whole thing struck me as being so singular. I was in a\r\ntantalizing mood, annoyed with myself on account of the pencil\r\nincident, and in a high degree disturbed by all the food I had taken on\r\na totally empty stomach. Suddenly my thoughts, as if whimsically\r\ninspired, take a singular direction. I feel myself seized with an odd\r\ndesire to make this lady afraid; to follow her, and annoy her in some\r\nway. I overtake her again, pass her by, turn quickly round, and meet\r\nher face-to-face in order to observe her well. I stand and gaze into\r\nher eyes, and hit, on the spur of the moment, on a name which I have\r\nnever heard before--a name with a gliding, nervous sound--Ylajali! When\r\nshe is quite close to me I draw myself up and say impressively:\r\n\r\n"You are losing your book, madam!" I could hear my heart beat audibly\r\nas I said it.\r\n\r\n"My book?" she asks her companion, and she walks on.\r\n\r\nMy devilment waxed apace, and I followed them. At the same time, I was\r\nfully conscious that I was playing a mad prank without being able to\r\nstop myself. My disordered condition ran away with me; I was inspired\r\nwith the craziest notions, which I followed blindly as they came to me.\r\nI couldn\'t help it, no matter how much I told myself that I was playing\r\nthe fool. I made the most idiotic grimaces behind the lady\'s back, and\r\ncoughed frantically as I passed her by. Walking on in this manner--very\r\nslowly, and always a few steps in advance--I felt her eyes on my back,\r\nand involuntarily put down my head with shame for having caused her\r\nannoyance. By degrees, a wonderful feeling stole over me of being far,\r\nfar away in other places; I had a half-undefined sense that it was not\r\nI who was going along over the gravel hanging my head.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, they reached Pascha\'s bookshop. I had already\r\nstopped at the first window, and as they go by I step forward and\r\nrepeat:\r\n\r\n"You are losing your book, madam!"\r\n\r\n"No; what book?" she asks affrightedly. "Can you make out what book it\r\nis he is talking about?" and she comes to a stop.\r\n\r\nI hug myself with delight at her confusion; the irresolute perplexity\r\nin her eyes positively fascinates me. Her mind cannot grasp my short,\r\npassionate address. She has no book with her; not a single page of a\r\nbook, and yet she fumbles in her pockets, looks down repeatedly at her\r\nhands, turns her head and scrutinizes the streets behind her, exerts\r\nher sensitive little brain to the utmost in trying to discover what\r\nbook it is I am talking about. Her face changes colour, has now one,\r\nnow another expression, and she is breathing quite audibly--even the\r\nvery buttons on her gown seem to stare at me, like a row of frightened\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t bother about him!" says her companion, taking her by the arm.\r\n"He is drunk; can\'t you see that the man is drunk?"\r\n\r\nStrange as I was at this instant to myself, so absolutely a prey to\r\npeculiar invisible inner influences, nothing occurred around me without\r\nmy observing it. A large, brown dog sprang right across the street\r\ntowards the shrubbery, and then down towards the Tivoli; he had on a\r\nvery narrow collar of German silver. Farther up the street a window\r\nopened on the second floor, and a servant-maid leant out of it, with\r\nher sleeves turned up, and began to clean the panes on the outside.\r\nNothing escaped my notice; I was clear-headed and ready-witted.\r\nEverything rushed in upon me with a gleaming distinctness, as if I were\r\nsuddenly surrounded by a strong light. The ladies before me had each a\r\nblue bird\'s wing in their hats, and a plaid silk ribbon round their\r\nnecks. It struck me that they were sisters.\r\n\r\nThey turned, stopped at Cisler\'s music-shop, and spoke together. I\r\nstopped also. Thereupon they both came back, went the same road as they\r\nhad come, passed me again, and turned the corner of University Street\r\nand up towards St. Olav\'s place. I was all the time as close at their\r\nheels as I dared to be. They turned round once, and sent me a\r\nhalf-fearful, half-questioning look, and I saw no resentment nor any\r\ntrace of a frown in it.\r\n\r\nThis forbearance with my annoyance shamed me thoroughly and made me\r\nlower my eyes. I would no longer be a trouble to them; out of sheer\r\ngratitude I would follow them with my gaze, not lose sight of them\r\nuntil they entered some place safely and disappeared.\r\n\r\nOutside No. 2, a large four-storeyed house, they turned again before\r\ngoing in. I leant against a lamp-post near the fountain and listened\r\nfor their footsteps on the stairs. They died away on the second floor.\r\nI advanced from the lamp-post and looked up at the house. Then\r\nsomething odd happened. The curtains above were stirred, and a second\r\nafter a window opened, a head popped out, and two singular-looking eyes\r\ndwelt on me. "Ylajali!" I muttered, half-aloud, and I felt I grew red.\r\n\r\nWhy does she not call for help, or push over one of these flower-pots\r\nand strike me on the head, or send some one down to drive me away? We\r\nstand and look into one another\'s eyes without moving; it lasts a\r\nminute. Thoughts dart between the window and the street, and not a word\r\nis spoken. She turns round, I feel a wrench in me, a delicate shock\r\nthrough my senses; I see a shoulder that turns, a back that disappears\r\nacross the floor. That reluctant turning from the window, the\r\naccentuation in that movement of the shoulders was like a nod to me. My\r\nblood was sensible of all the delicate, dainty greeting, and I felt all\r\nat once rarely glad. Then I wheeled round and went down the street.\r\n\r\nI dared not look back, and knew not if she had returned to the window.\r\nThe more I considered this question the more nervous and restless I\r\nbecame. Probably at this very moment she was standing watching closely\r\nall my movements. It is by no means comfortable to know that you are\r\nbeing watched from behind your back. I pulled myself together as well\r\nas I could and proceeded on my way; my legs began to jerk under me, my\r\ngait became unsteady just because I purposely tried to make it look\r\nwell. In order to appear at ease and indifferent, I flung my arms\r\nabout, spat out, and threw my head well back--all without avail, for I\r\ncontinually felt the pursuing eyes on my neck, and a cold shiver ran\r\ndown my back. At length I escaped down a side street, from which I took\r\nthe road to Pyle Street to get my pencil.\r\n\r\nI had no difficulty in recovering it; the man brought me the waistcoat\r\nhimself, and as he did so, begged me to search through all the pockets.\r\nI found also a couple of pawn-tickets which I pocketed as I thanked the\r\nobliging little man for his civility. I was more and more taken with\r\nhim, and grew all of a sudden extremely anxious to make a favourable\r\nimpression on this person. I took a turn towards the door and then back\r\nagain to the counter as if I had forgotten something. It struck me that\r\nI owed him an explanation, that I ought to elucidate matters a little.\r\nI began to hum in order to attract his attention. Then, taking the\r\npencil in my hand, I held it up and said:\r\n\r\n"It would never have entered my head to come such a long way for any\r\nand every bit of pencil, but with this one it was quite a different\r\nmatter; there was another reason, a special reason. Insignificant as it\r\nlooked, this stump of pencil had simply made me what I was in the\r\nworld, so to say, placed me in life." I said no more. The man had come\r\nright over to the counter.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said he, and he looked inquiringly at me.\r\n\r\n"It was with this pencil," I continued, in cold blood, "that I wrote my\r\ndissertation on \'Philosophical Cognition,\' in three volumes." Had he\r\nnever heard mention of it?\r\n\r\nWell, he did seem to remember having heard the name, rather the title.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I, "that was by me, so it was." So he must really not be\r\nastonished that I should be desirous of having the little bit of pencil\r\nback again. I valued it far too highly to lose it; why, it was almost\r\nas much to me as a little human creature. For the rest I was honestly\r\ngrateful to him for his civility, and I would bear him in mind for it.\r\nYes, truly, I really would. A promise was a promise; that was the sort\r\nof man I was, and he really deserved it. "Good-bye!" I walked to the\r\ndoor with the bearing of one who had it in his power to place a man in\r\na high position, say in the fire-office. The honest pawnbroker bowed\r\ntwice profoundly to me as I withdrew. I turned again and repeated my\r\ngood-bye.\r\n\r\nOn the stairs I met a woman with a travelling-bag in her hand, who\r\nsqueezed diffidently against the wall to make room for me, and I\r\nvoluntarily thrust my hand in my pocket for something to give her, and\r\nlooked foolish as I found nothing and passed on with my head down. I\r\nheard her knock at the office door; there was an alarm over it, and I\r\nrecognized the jingling sound it gave when any one rapped on the door\r\nwith his knuckles.\r\n\r\nThe sun stood in the south; it was about twelve. The whole town began\r\nto get on its legs as it approached the fashionable hour for\r\npromenading. Bowing and laughing folk walked up and down Carl Johann\r\nStreet. I stuck my elbows closely to my sides, tried to make myself\r\nlook small, and slipped unperceived past some acquaintances who had\r\ntaken up their stand at the corner of University Street to gaze at the\r\npassers-by. I wandered up Castle Hill and fell into a reverie.\r\n\r\nHow gaily and lightly these people I met carried their radiant heads,\r\nand swung themselves through life as through a ball-room! There was no\r\nsorrow in a single look I met, no burden on any shoulder, perhaps not\r\neven a clouded thought, not a little hidden pain in any of the happy\r\nsouls. And I, walking in the very midst of these people, young and\r\nnewly-fledged as I was, had already forgotten the very look of\r\nhappiness. I hugged these thoughts to myself as I went on, and found\r\nthat a great injustice had been done me. Why had the last months\r\npressed so strangely hard on me? I failed to recognize my own happy\r\ntemperament, and I met with the most singular annoyances from all\r\nquarters. I could not sit down on a bench by myself or set my foot any\r\nplace without being assailed by insignificant accidents, miserable\r\ndetails, that forced their way into my imagination and scattered my\r\npowers to all the four winds. A dog that dashed by me, a yellow rose in\r\na man\'s buttonhole, had the power to set my thoughts vibrating and\r\noccupy me for a length of time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat was it that ailed me? Was the hand of the Lord turned against me?\r\nBut why just against me? Why, for that matter, not just as well against\r\na man in South America? When I considered the matter over, it grew more\r\nand more incomprehensible to me that I of all others should be selected\r\nas an experiment for a Creator\'s whims. It was, to say the least of it,\r\na peculiar mode of procedure to pass over a whole world of other humans\r\nin order to reach me. Why not select just as well Bookseller Pascha, or\r\nHennechen the steam agent?\r\n\r\nAs I went my way I sifted this thing, and could not get quit of it. I\r\nfound the most weighty arguments against the Creator\'s arbitrariness in\r\nletting me pay for all the others\' sins. Even after I had found a seat\r\nand sat down, the query persisted in occupying me, and prevented me\r\nfrom thinking of aught else. From the day in May when my ill-luck began\r\nI could so clearly notice my gradually increasing debility; I had\r\nbecome, as it were, too languid to control or lead myself whither I\r\nwould go. A swarm of tiny noxious animals had bored a way into my inner\r\nman and hollowed me out.\r\n\r\nSupposing God Almighty simply intended to annihilate me? I got up and\r\npaced backwards and forwards before the seat.\r\n\r\nMy whole being was at this moment in the highest degree of torture, I\r\nhad pains in my arms, and could hardly bear to hold them in the usual\r\nway. I experienced also great discomfort from my last full meal; I was\r\noversated, and walked backwards and forwards without looking up. The\r\npeople who came and went around me glided past me like faint gleams. At\r\nlast my seat was taken up by two men, who lit cigars and began to talk\r\nloudly together. I got angry and was on the point of addressing them,\r\nbut turned on my heel and went right to the other end of the Park, and\r\nfound another seat. I sat down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thought of God began to occupy me. It seemed to me in the highest\r\ndegree indefensible of Him to interfere every time I sought for a\r\nplace, and to upset the whole thing, while all the time I was but\r\nimploring enough for a daily meal.\r\n\r\nI had remarked so plainly that, whenever I had been hungry for any\r\nlength of time, it was just as if my brains ran quite gently out of my\r\nhead and left me with a vacuum--my head grew light and far off, I no\r\nlonger felt its weight on my shoulders, and I had a consciousness that\r\nmy eyes stared far too widely open when I looked at anything.\r\n\r\nI sat there on the seat and pondered over all this, and grew more and\r\nmore bitter against God for His prolonged inflictions. If He meant to\r\ndraw me nearer to Him, and make me better by exhausting me and placing\r\nobstacle after obstacle in my way, I could assure Him He made a slight\r\nmistake. And, almost crying with defiance, I looked up towards Heaven\r\nand told Him so mentally, once and for all.\r\n\r\nFragments of the teachings of my childhood ran through my memory. The\r\nrhythmical sound of Biblical language sang in my ears, and I talked\r\nquite softly to myself, and held my head sneeringly askew. Wherefore\r\nshould I sorrow for what I eat, for what I drink, or for what I may\r\narray this miserable food for worms called my earthy body? Hath not my\r\nHeavenly Father provided for me, even as for the sparrow on the\r\nhousetop, and hath He not in His graciousness pointed towards His lowly\r\nservitor? The Lord stuck His finger in the net of my nerves\r\ngently--yea, verily, in desultory fashion--and brought slight disorder\r\namong the threads. And then the Lord withdrew His finger, and there\r\nwere fibres and delicate root-like filaments adhering to the finger,\r\nand they were the nerve-threads of the filaments. And there was a\r\ngaping hole after the finger, which was God\'s finger, and a wound in my\r\nbrain in the track of His finger. But when God had touched me with His\r\nfinger, He let me be, and touched me no more, and let no evil befall\r\nme; but let me depart in peace, and let me depart with the gaping hole.\r\nAnd no evil hath befallen me from the God who is the Lord God of all\r\nEternity.\r\n\r\nThe sound of music was borne up on the wind to me from the Students\'\r\nAll\xc3\xa9e. It was therefore past two o\'clock. I took out my writing\r\nmaterials to try to write something, and at the same time my book of\r\nshaving-tickets [Footnote: Issued by the barbers at cheaper rates, as\r\nfew men in Norway shave themselves.] fell out of my pocket. I opened\r\nit, and counted the tickets; there were six. "The Lord be praised," I\r\nexclaimed involuntarily; "I can still get shaved for a couple of weeks,\r\nand look a little decent"; and I immediately fell into a better frame\r\nof mind on account of this little property which still remained to me.\r\nI smoothed the leaves out carefully, and put the book safely into my\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nBut write I could not. After a few lines nothing seemed to occur to me;\r\nmy thought ran in other directions, and I could not pull myself\r\ntogether enough for any special exertion.\r\n\r\nEverything influenced and distracted me; everything I saw made a fresh\r\nimpression on me. Flies and tiny mosquitoes stick fast to the paper and\r\ndisturb me. I blow at them to get rid of them--blow harder and harder;\r\nto no purpose, the little pests throw themselves on their backs, make\r\nthemselves heavy, and fight against me until their slender legs bend.\r\nThey are not to be moved from the spot; they find something to hook on\r\nto, set their heels against a comma or an unevenness in the paper, or\r\nstand immovably still until they themselves think fit to go their way.\r\n\r\nThese insects continued to busy me for a long time, and I crossed my\r\nlegs to observe them at leisure. All at once a couple of high clarionet\r\nnotes waved up to me from the bandstand, and gave my thoughts a new\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\nDespondent at not being able to put my article together, I replaced the\r\npaper in my pocket, and leant back in the seat. At this instant my head\r\nis so clear that I can follow the most delicate train of thought\r\nwithout tiring. As I lie in this position, and let my eyes glide down\r\nmy breast and along my legs, I notice the jerking movement my foot\r\nmakes each time my pulse beats. I half rise and look down at my feet,\r\nand I experience at this moment a fantastic and singular feeling that I\r\nhave never felt before--a delicate, wonderful shock through my nerves,\r\nas if sparks of cold light quivered through them--it was as if catching\r\nsight of my shoes I had met with a kind old acquaintance, or got back a\r\npart of myself that had been riven loose. A feeling of recognition\r\ntrembles through my senses; the tears well up in my eyes, and I have a\r\nfeeling as if my shoes are a soft, murmuring strain rising towards me.\r\n"Weakness!" I cried harshly to myself, and I clenched my fists and I\r\nrepeated "Weakness!" I laughed at myself, for this ridiculous feeling,\r\nmade fun of myself, with a perfect consciousness of doing so, talked\r\nvery severely and sensibly, and closed my eyes very tightly to get rid\r\nof the tears.\r\n\r\nAs if I had never seen my shoes before, I set myself to study their\r\nlooks, their characteristics, and, when I stir my foot, their shape and\r\ntheir worn uppers. I discover that their creases and white seams give\r\nthem expression--impart a physiognomy to them. Something of my own\r\nnature had gone over into these shoes; they affected me, like a ghost\r\nof my other I--a breathing portion of my very self.\r\n\r\nI sat and toyed with these fancies a long time, perhaps an entire hour.\r\nA little, old man came and took the other end of the seat; as he seated\r\nhimself he panted after his walk, and muttered:\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay; very true!"\r\n\r\nAs soon as I heard his voice, I felt as if a wind had swept through my\r\nhead. I let shoes be shoes, and it seemed to me that the distracted\r\nphase of mind I had just experienced dated from a long-vanished period,\r\nmaybe a year or two back, and was about to be quietly effaced from my\r\nmemory. I began to observe the old fellow.\r\n\r\nDid this little man concern me in any way? Not in the least, not in the\r\nvery slightest degree! Only that he held a newspaper in his hand, an\r\nold number (with the advertisement sheet on the outside), in which\r\nsomething or other seemed to be rolled up; my curiosity was aroused,\r\nand I could not take my eyes away from this paper. The insane idea\r\nentered my head that it might be a quite peculiar newspaper--unique of\r\nits kind. My curiosity increased, and I began to move backwards and\r\nforwards on the seat. It might contain deeds, dangerous documents\r\nstolen from some archive or other; something floated before me about a\r\nsecret treaty--a conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe man sat quietly, and pondered. Why did he not carry his newspaper\r\nas every other person carries a paper, with its name out? What species\r\nof cunning lurked under that? He did not seem either to like letting\r\nhis package out of his hands, not for anything in the world; perhaps he\r\ndid not even dare trust it into his own pocket. I could stake my life\r\nthere was something at the bottom of that package--I considered a bit.\r\nJust the fact of finding it so impossible to penetrate this mysterious\r\naffair distracted me with curiosity. I searched my pockets for\r\nsomething to offer the man in order to enter into conversation with\r\nhim, took hold of my shaving-book, but put it back again. Suddenly it\r\nentered my head to be utterly audacious; I slapped my empty\r\nbreast-pocket, and said:\r\n\r\n"May I offer you a cigarette?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you!" The man did not smoke; he had to give it up to spare his\r\neyes; he was nearly blind. Thank you very much all the same. Was it\r\nlong since his eyes got bad? In that case, perhaps, he could not read\r\neither, not even a paper?\r\n\r\nNo, not even the newspaper, more\'s the pity. The man looked at me; his\r\nweak eyes were each covered with a film which gave them a glassy\r\nappearance; his gaze grew bleary, and made a disgusting impression on\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"You are a stranger here?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes." Could he not even read the name of the paper he held in his hand?\r\n\r\n"Barely." For that matter, he could hear directly that I was a\r\nstranger. There was something in my accent which told him. It did not\r\nneed much; he could hear so well. At night, when every one slept, he\r\ncould hear people in the next room breathing....\r\n\r\n"What I was going to say was, \'where do you live?\'"\r\n\r\nOn the spur of the moment a lie stood, ready-made, in my head. I lied\r\ninvoluntarily, without any object, without any _arri\xc3\xa8re pens\xc3\xa9e_, and I\r\nanswered--\r\n\r\n"St. Olav\'s Place, No. 2."\r\n\r\n"Really?" He knew every stone in St. Olav\'s Place. There was a\r\nfountain, some lamp-posts, a few trees; he remembered all of it. "What\r\nnumber do you live in?"\r\n\r\nDesirous to put an end to this, I got up. But my notion about the\r\nnewspaper had driven me to my wit\'s end; I resolved to clear the thing\r\nup, at no matter what cost.\r\n\r\n"When you cannot read the paper, why--"\r\n\r\n"In No. 2, I think you said," continued the man, without noticing my\r\ndisturbance. "There was a time I knew every person in No. 2; what is\r\nyour landlord\'s name?"\r\n\r\nI quickly found a name to get rid of him; invented one on the spur of\r\nthe moment, and blurted it out to stop my tormentor.\r\n\r\n"Happolati!" said I.\r\n\r\n"Happolati, ay!" nodded the man; and he never missed a syllable of this\r\ndifficult name.\r\n\r\nI looked at him with amazement; there he sat, gravely, with a\r\nconsidering air. Before I had well given utterance to the stupid name\r\nwhich jumped into my head the man had accommodated himself to it, and\r\npretended to have heard it before.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, he had laid his package on the seat, and I felt my\r\ncuriosity quiver through my nerves. I noticed there were a few grease\r\nspots on the paper.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he a sea-faring man, your landlord?" queried he, and there was\r\nnot a trace of suppressed irony in his voice; "I seem to remember he\r\nwas."\r\n\r\n"Sea-faring man? Excuse me, it must be the brother you know; this man\r\nis namely J. A. Happolati, the agent."\r\n\r\nI thought this would finish him; but he willingly fell in with\r\neverything I said. If I had found a name like Barrabas Rosebud it would\r\nnot have roused his suspicions.\r\n\r\n"He is an able man, I have heard?" he said, feeling his way.\r\n\r\n"Oh, a clever fellow!" answered I; "a thorough business head; agent for\r\nevery possible thing going. Cranberries from China; feathers and down\r\nfrom Russia; hides, pulp, writing-ink--"\r\n\r\n"He, he! the devil he is?" interrupted the old chap, highly excited.\r\n\r\nThis began to get interesting. The situation ran away with me, and one\r\nlie after another engendered in my head. I sat down again, forgot the\r\nnewspaper, and the remarkable documents, grew lively, and cut short the\r\nold fellow\'s talk.\r\n\r\nThe little goblin\'s unsuspecting simplicity made me foolhardy; I would\r\nstuff him recklessly full of lies; rout him out o\' field grandly, and\r\nstop his mouth from sheer amazement.\r\n\r\nHad he heard of the electric psalm-book that Happolati had invented?\r\n\r\n"What? Elec--"\r\n\r\n"With electric letters that could give light in the dark! a perfectly\r\nextraordinary enterprise. A million crowns to be put in circulation;\r\nfoundries and printing-presses at work, and shoals of regular mechanics\r\nto be employed; I had heard as many as seven hundred men."\r\n\r\n"Ay, isn\'t it just what I say?" drawled out the man calmly.\r\n\r\nHe said no more, he believed every word I related, and for all that, he\r\nwas not taken aback. This disappointed me a little; I had expected to\r\nsee him utterly bewildered by my inventions.\r\n\r\nI searched my brain for a couple of desperate lies, went the whole hog,\r\nhinted that Happolati had been Minister of State for nine years in\r\nPersia. "You perhaps have no conception of what it means to be Minister\r\nof State in Persia?" I asked. It was more than king here, or about the\r\nsame as Sultan, if he knew what that meant, but Happolati had managed\r\nthe whole thing, and was never at a loss. And I related about his\r\ndaughter Ylajali, a fairy, a princess, who had three hundred slaves,\r\nand who reclined on a couch of yellow roses. She was the loveliest\r\ncreature I had ever seen; I had, may the Lord strike me, never seen her\r\nmatch for looks in my life!\r\n\r\n"So--o; was she so lovely?" remarked the old fellow, with an absent\r\nair, as he gazed at the ground.\r\n\r\n"Lovely? She was beauteous, she was sinfully fascinating. Eyes like raw\r\nsilk, arms of amber! Just one glance from her was as seductive as a\r\nkiss; and when she called me, her voice darted like a wine-ray right\r\ninto my soul\'s phosphor. And why shouldn\'t she be so beautiful?" Did he\r\nimagine she was a messenger or something in the fire brigade? She was\r\nsimply a Heaven\'s wonder, I could just inform him, a fairy tale.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure!" said he, not a little bewildered. His quiet bored\r\nme; I was excited by the sound of my own voice and spoke in utter\r\nseriousness; the stolen archives, treaties with some foreign power or\r\nother, no longer occupied my thoughts; the little flat bundle of paper\r\nlay on the seat between us, and I had no longer the smallest desire to\r\nexamine it or see what it contained. I was entirely absorbed in stories\r\nof my own which floated in singular visions across my mental eye. The\r\nblood flew to my head, and I roared with laughter.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the little man seemed about to go. He stretched himself,\r\nand in order not to break off too abruptly, added: "He is said to own\r\nmuch property, this Happolati?"\r\n\r\nHow dared this bleary-eyed, disgusting old man toss about the rare name\r\nI had invented as if it were a common name stuck up over every\r\nhuckster-shop in the town? He never stumbled over a letter or forgot a\r\nsyllable. The name had bitten fast in his brain and struck root on the\r\ninstant. I got annoyed; an inward exasperation surged up in me against\r\nthis creature whom nothing had the power to disturb and nothing render\r\nsuspicious.\r\n\r\nI therefore replied shortly, "I know nothing about that! I know\r\nabsolutely nothing whatever about that! Let me inform you once for all\r\nthat his name is Johann Arendt Happolati, if you go by his own\r\ninitials."\r\n\r\n"Johannn Arendt Happolati!" repeated the man, a little astonished at my\r\nvehemence; and with that he grew silent.\r\n\r\n"You should see his wife!" I said, beside myself. "A fatter creature\r\n... Eh? what? Perhaps you don\'t even believe she is really fat?"\r\n\r\nWell, indeed he did not see his way to deny that such a man might\r\nperhaps have a rather stout wife. The old fellow answered quite gently\r\nand meekly to each of my assertions, and sought for words as if he\r\nfeared to offend and perhaps make me furious.\r\n\r\n"Hell and fire, man! Do you imagine that I am sitting here stuffing you\r\nchock-full of lies?" I roared furiously. "Perhaps you don\'t even\r\nbelieve that a man of the name of Happolati exists! I never saw your\r\nmatch for obstinacy and malice in any old man. What the devil ails you?\r\nPerhaps, too, into the bargain, you have been all this while thinking\r\nto yourself I am a poverty-stricken fellow, sitting here in my\r\nSunday-best without even a case full of cigarettes in my pocket. Let me\r\ntell you such treatment as yours is a thing I am not accustomed to, and\r\nI won\'t endure it, the Lord strike me dead if I will--neither from you\r\nnor any one else, do you know that?"\r\n\r\nThe man had risen with his mouth agape; he stood tongue-tied and\r\nlistened to my outbreak until the end. Then he snatched his parcel from\r\noff the seat and went, ay, nearly ran, down the patch, with the short,\r\ntottering steps of an old man.\r\n\r\nI leant back and looked at the retreating figure that seemed to shrink\r\nat each step as it passed away. I do not know from where the impression\r\ncame, but it appeared to me that I had never in my life seen a more\r\nvile back than this one, and I did not regret that I had abused the\r\ncreature before he left me.\r\n\r\nThe day began to decline, the sun sank, it commenced to rustle lightly\r\nin the trees around, and the nursemaids who sat in groups near the\r\nparallel bars made ready to wheel their perambulators home. I was\r\ncalmed and in good spirit. The excitement I had just laboured under\r\nquieted down little by little, and I grew weaker, more languid, and\r\nbegan to feel drowsy. Neither did the quantity of bread I had eaten\r\ncause me any longer any particular distress. I leant against the back\r\nof the seat in the best of humours, closed my eyes, and got more and\r\nmore sleepy. I dozed, and was just on the point of falling asleep, when\r\na park-keeper put his hand on my shoulder and said:\r\n\r\n"You must not sit here and go to sleep!"\r\n\r\n"No?" I said, and sprang immediately up, my unfortunate position rising\r\nall at once vividly before my eyes. I must do something; find some way\r\nor another out of it. To look for situations had been of no avail to\r\nme. Even the recommendations I showed had grown a little old, and were\r\nwritten by people all too little known to be of much use; besides that,\r\nconstant refusals all through the summer had somewhat disheartened me.\r\nAt all events, my rent was due, and I must raise the wind for that; the\r\nrest would have to wait a little.\r\n\r\nQuite involuntarily I had got paper and pencil into my hand again, and\r\nI sat and wrote mechanically the date, 1848, in each corner. If only\r\nnow one single effervescing thought would grip me powerfully, and put\r\nwords into my mouth. Why, I had known hours when I could write a long\r\npiece, without the least exertion, and turn it off capitally, too.\r\n\r\nI am sitting on the seat, and I write, scores of times, 1848. I write\r\nthis date criss-cross, in all possible fashions, and wait until a\r\nworkable idea shall occur to me. A swarm of loose thoughts flutter\r\nabout in my head. The feeling of declining day makes me downcast,\r\nsentimental; autumn is here, and has already begun to hush everything\r\ninto sleep and torpor. The flies and insects have received their first\r\nwarning. Up in the trees and down in the fields the sounds of\r\nstruggling life can be heard rustling, murmuring, restless; labouring\r\nnot to perish. The down-trodden existence of the whole insect world is\r\nastir for yet a little while. They poke their yellow heads up from the\r\nturf, lift their legs, feel their way with long feelers and then\r\ncollapse suddenly, roll over, and turn their bellies in the air.\r\n\r\nEvery growing thing has received its peculiar impress: the delicately\r\nblown breath of the first cold. The stubbles straggle wanly sunwards,\r\nand the falling leaves rustle to the earth, with a sound as of errant\r\nsilkworms.\r\n\r\nIt is the reign of Autumn, the height of the Carnival of Decay, the\r\nroses have got inflammation in their blushes, an uncanny hectic tinge,\r\nthrough their soft damask.\r\n\r\nI felt myself like a creeping thing on the verge of destruction,\r\ngripped by ruin in the midst of a whole world ready for lethargic\r\nsleep. I rose, oppressed by weird terrors, and took some furious\r\nstrides down the path. "No!" I cried out, clutching both my hands;\r\n"there must be an end to this," and I reseated myself, grasped the\r\npencil, and set seriously to work at an article.\r\n\r\nThere was no possible use in giving way, with the unpaid rent staring\r\nme straight in the face.\r\n\r\nSlowly, quite slowly, my thoughts collected. I paid attention to them,\r\nand wrote quietly and well; wrote a couple of pages as an introduction.\r\nIt would serve as a beginning to anything. A description of travel, a\r\npolitical leader, just as I thought fit--it was a perfectly splendid\r\ncommencement for something or anything. So I took to seeking for some\r\nparticular subject to handle, a person or a thing, that I might grapple\r\nwith, and I could find nothing. Along with this fruitless exertion,\r\ndisorder began to hold its sway again in my thoughts. I felt how my\r\nbrain positively snapped and my head emptied, until it sat at last,\r\nlight, buoyant, and void on my shoulders. I was conscious of the gaping\r\nvacuum in my skull with every fibre of my being. I seemed to myself to\r\nbe hollowed out from top and toe.\r\n\r\nIn my pain I cried: "Lord, my God and Father!" and repeated this cry\r\nmany times at a stretch, without adding one word more.\r\n\r\nThe wind soughed through the trees; a storm was brewing. I sat a while\r\nlonger, and gazed at my paper, lost in thought, then folded it up and\r\nput it slowly into my pocket. It got chilly; and I no longer owned a\r\nwaistcoat. I buttoned my coat right up to my throat and thrust my hands\r\nin my pockets; thereupon I rose and went on.\r\n\r\nIf I had only succeeded this time, just this once. Twice my landlady\r\nhad asked me with her eyes for payment, and I was obliged to hang my\r\nhead and slink past her with a shamefaced air. I could not do it again:\r\nthe very next time I met those eyes I would give warning and account\r\nfor myself honestly. Well, any way, things could not last long at this\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nOn coming to the exit of the park I saw the old chap I had put to\r\nflight. The mysterious new paper parcel lay opened on the seat next\r\nhim, filled with different sorts of victuals, of which he ate as he\r\nsat. I immediately wanted to go over and ask pardon for my conduct, but\r\nthe sight of food repelled me. The decrepit fingers looked like ten\r\nclaws as they clutched loathsomely at the greasy bread and butter; I\r\nfelt qualmish, and passed by without addressing him. He did not\r\nrecognize me; his eyes stared at me, dry as horn, and his face did not\r\nmove a muscle.\r\n\r\nAnd so I went on my way.\r\n\r\nAs customary, I halted before every newspaper placard I came to, to\r\nread the announcements of situations vacant, and was lucky enough to\r\nfind one that I might try for.\r\n\r\nA grocer in Groenlandsleret wanted a man every week for a couple of\r\nhours\' book-keeping; remuneration according to agreement. I noted my\r\nman\'s address, and prayed to God in silence for this place. I would\r\ndemand less than any one else for my work; sixpence was ample, or\r\nperhaps fivepence. That would not matter in the least.\r\n\r\nOn going home, a slip of paper from my landlady lay on my table, in\r\nwhich she begged me to pay my rent in advance, or else move as soon as\r\nI could. I must not be offended, it was absolutely a necessary request.\r\nFriendlily Mrs. Gundersen.\r\n\r\nI wrote an application to Christy the grocer, No. 13 Groenlandsleret,\r\nput it in an envelope, and took it to the pillar at the corner. Then I\r\nreturned to my room and sat down in the rocking-chair to think, whilst\r\nthe darkness grew closer and closer. Sitting up late began to be\r\ndifficult now.\r\n\r\nI woke very early in the morning. It was still quite dark as I opened\r\nmy eyes, and it was not till long after that I heard five strokes of\r\nthe clock down-stairs. I turned round to doze again, but sleep had\r\ndown. I grew more and more wakeful, and lay and thought of a thousand\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a few good sentences fitted for a sketch or story strike me,\r\ndelicate linguistic hits of which I have never before found the equal.\r\nI lie and repeat these words over to myself, and find that they are\r\ncapital. Little by little others come and fit themselves to the\r\npreceding ones. I grow keenly wakeful. I get up and snatch paper and\r\npencil from the table behind my bed. It was as if a vein had burst in\r\nme; one word follows another, and they fit themselves together\r\nharmoniously with telling effect. Scene piles on scene, actions and\r\nspeeches bubble up in my brain, and a wonderful sense of pleasure\r\nempowers me. I write as one possessed, and fill page after page,\r\nwithout a moment\'s pause.\r\n\r\nThoughts come so swiftly to me and continue to flow so richly that I\r\nmiss a number of telling bits, that I cannot set down quickly enough,\r\nalthough I work with all my might. They continue to invade me; I am\r\nfull of my subject, and every word I write is inspired.\r\n\r\nThis strange period lasts--lasts such a blessedly long time before it\r\ncomes to an end. I have fifteen--twenty written pages lying on my knees\r\nbefore me, when at last I cease and lay my pencil aside, So sure as\r\nthere is any worth in these pages, so sure am I saved. I jump out of\r\nbed and dress myself. It grows lighter. I can half distinguish the\r\nlighthouse director\'s announcement down near the door, and near the\r\nwindow it is already so light that I could, in case of necessity, see\r\nto write. I set to work immediately to make a fair copy of what I have\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nAn intense, peculiar exhalation of light and colour emanates from these\r\nfantasies of mine. I start with surprise as I note one good thing after\r\nanother, and tell myself that this is the best thing I have ever read.\r\nMy head swims with a sense of satisfaction; delight inflates me; I grow\r\ngrandiose.\r\n\r\nI weigh my writing in my hand, and value it, at a loose guess, for five\r\nshillings on the spot.\r\n\r\nIt could never enter any one\'s head to chaffer about five shillings; on\r\nthe contrary, getting it for half-a-sovereign might be considered\r\ndirt-cheap, considering the quality of the thing.\r\n\r\nI had no intention of turning off such special work gratis. As far as I\r\nwas aware, one did not pick up stories of that kind on the wayside, and\r\nI decided on half-a-sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe room brightened and brightened. I threw a glance towards the door,\r\nand could distinguish without particular trouble the skeleton-like\r\nletters of Miss Andersen\'s winding-sheet advertisement to the right of\r\nit. It was also a good while since the clock has struck seven.\r\n\r\nI rose and came to a standstill in the middle of the floor. Everything\r\nwell considered, Mrs. Gundersen\'s warning came rather opportunely. This\r\nwas, properly speaking, no fit room for me: there were only common\r\nenough green curtains at the windows, and neither were there any pegs\r\ntoo many on the wall. The poor little rocking-chair over in the corner\r\nwas in reality a mere attempt at a rocking-chair; with the smallest\r\nsense of humour, one might easily split one\'s sides with laughter at\r\nit. It was far too low for a grown man, and besides that, one needed,\r\nso to speak, the aid of a boot-jack to get out of it. To cut it short,\r\nthe room was not adopted for the pursuit of things intellectual, and I\r\ndid not intend to keep it any longer. On no account would I keep it. I\r\nhad held my peace, and endured and lived far too long in such a den.\r\n\r\nBuoyed up by hope and satisfaction, constantly occupied with my\r\nremarkable sketch, which I drew forth every moment from my pocket and\r\nre-read, I determined to set seriously to work with my flitting. I took\r\nout my bundle, a red handkerchief that contained a few clean collars\r\nand some crumpled newspapers, in which I had occasionally carried home\r\nbread. I rolled my blanket up and pocketed my reserve white\r\nwriting-paper. Then I ransacked every corner to assure myself that I\r\nhad left nothing behind, and as I could not find anything, went over to\r\nthe window and looked out.\r\n\r\nThe morning was gloomy and wet; there was no one about at the burnt-out\r\nsmithy, and the clothesline down in the yard stretched tightly from\r\nwall to wall shrunken by the wet. It was all familiar to me, so I\r\nstepped back from the window, took the blanket under my arm, and made a\r\nlow bow to the lighthouse director\'s announcement, bowed again to Miss\r\nAndersen\'s winding-sheet advertisement, and opened the door. Suddenly\r\nthe thought of my land-lady struck me; she really ought to be informed\r\nof my leaving, so that she could see she had had an honest soul to deal\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nI wanted also to thank her in writing for the few days\' overtime in\r\nwhich I occupied the room. The certainty that I was now saved for some\r\ntime to come increased so strongly in me that I even promised her five\r\nshillings. I would call in some day when passing by.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I wanted to prove to her what an upright sort of person\r\nher roof had sheltered.\r\n\r\nI left the note behind me on the table.\r\n\r\nOnce again I stopped at the door and turned round; the buoyant feeling\r\nof having risen once again to the surface charmed me, and made me feel\r\ngrateful towards God and all creation, and I knelt down at the bedside\r\nand thanked God aloud for His great goodness to me that morning.\r\n\r\nI knew it; ah! I knew that the rapture of inspiration I had just felt\r\nand noted down was a miraculous heaven-brew in my spirit in answer to\r\nmy yesterday\'s cry for aid.\r\n\r\n"It was God! It was God!" I cried to myself, and I wept for enthusiasm\r\nover my own words; now and then I had to stop and listen if any one was\r\non the stairs. At last I rose up and prepared to go. I stole\r\nnoiselessly down each flight and reached the door unseen.\r\n\r\nThe streets were glistening from the rain which had fallen in the early\r\nmorning. The sky hung damp and heavy over the town, and there was no\r\nglint of sunlight visible. I wondered what the day would bring forth? I\r\nwent as usual in the direction of the Town Hall, and saw that it was\r\nhalf-past eight. I had yet a few hours to walk about; there was no use\r\nin going to the newspaper office before ten, perhaps eleven. I must\r\nlounge about so long, and think, in the meantime, over some expedient\r\nto raise breakfast. For that matter, I had no fear of going to bed\r\nhungry that day; those times were over, God be praised! That was a\r\nthing of the past, an evil dream. Henceforth, Excelsior!\r\n\r\nBut, in the meanwhile, the green blanket was a trouble to me. Neither\r\ncould I well make myself conspicuous by carrying such a thing about\r\nright under people\'s eyes. What would any one think of me? And as I\r\nwent on I tried to think of a place where I could have it kept till\r\nlater on. It occurred to me that I might go into Semb\'s and get it\r\nwrapped up in paper; not only would it look better, but I need no\r\nlonger be ashamed of carrying it.\r\n\r\nI entered the shop, and stated my errand to one of the shop boys.\r\n\r\nHe looked first at the blanket, then at me. It struck me that he\r\nshrugged his shoulders to himself a little contemptuously as he took\r\nit; this annoyed me.\r\n\r\n"Young man," I cried, "do be a little careful! There are two costly\r\nglass vases in that; the parcel has to go to Smyrna."\r\n\r\nThis had a famous effect. The fellow apologized with every movement he\r\nmade for not having guessed that there was something out of the common\r\nin this blanket. When he had finished packing it up I thanked him with\r\nthe air of a man who had sent precious goods to Smyrna before now. He\r\nheld the door open for me, and bowed twice as I left.\r\n\r\nI began to wander about amongst the people in the market place, kept\r\nfrom choice near the woman who had potted plants for sale. The heavy\r\ncrimson roses--the leaves of which glowed blood-like and moist in the\r\ndamp morning--made me envious, and tempted me sinfully to snatch one,\r\nand I inquired the price of them merely as an excuse to approach as\r\nnear to them as possible.\r\n\r\nIf I had any money over I would buy one, no matter how things went;\r\nindeed, I might well save a little now and then out of my way of living\r\nto balance things again.\r\n\r\nIt was ten o\'clock, and I went up to the newspaper office. "Scissors"\r\nis running through a lot of old papers. The editor has not come yet. On\r\nbeing asked my business, I delivered my weighty manuscript, lead him to\r\nsuppose that it is something of more than uncommon importance, and\r\nimpress upon his memory gravely that he is to give it into we editor\'s\r\nown hands as soon as he arrives.\r\n\r\nI would myself call later on in the day for an answer.\r\n\r\n"All right," replied "Scissors," and busied himself again with his\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that he treated the matter somewhat too coolly; but I\r\nsaid nothing, only nodded rather carelessly to him, and left.\r\n\r\nI had now time on hand! If it would only clear up! It was perfectly\r\nwretched weather, without either wind or freshness. Ladies carried\r\ntheir umbrellas, to be on the safe side, and the woollen caps of the\r\nmen looked limp and depressing.\r\n\r\nI took another turn across the market and looked at the vegetables and\r\nroses. I feel a hand on my shoulder and turn round--"Missy" bids me\r\ngood morning! "Good-morning!" I say in return, a little questioningly.\r\nI never cared particularly for "Missy."\r\n\r\nHe looks inquisitively at the large brand-new parcel under my arm, and\r\nasks:\r\n\r\n"What have you got there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have been down to Semb and got some cloth for a suit," I reply,\r\nin a careless tone. "I didn\'t think I could rub on any longer; there\'s\r\nsuch a thing as treating oneself too shabbily."\r\n\r\nHe looks at me with an amazed start.\r\n\r\n"By the way, how are you getting on?" He asks it slowly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, beyond all expectation!"\r\n\r\n"Then you have got something to do now?"\r\n\r\n"Something to do?" I answer and seem surprised. "Rather! Why, I am\r\nbook-keeper at Christensen\'s--a wholesale house."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!" he remarks and draws back a little.\r\n\r\n"Well, God knows I am the first to be pleased at your success. If only\r\nyou don\'t let people beg the money from you that you earn. Good-day!"\r\n\r\nA second after he wheels round and comes back and, pointing with his\r\ncane to my parcel, says:\r\n\r\n"I would recommend my tailor to you for the suit of clothes. You won\'t\r\nfind a better tailor than Isaksen--just say I sent you, that\'s all!"\r\n\r\nThis was really rather more than I could swallow. What did he want to\r\npoke his nose in my affairs for? Was it any concern of his which tailor\r\nI employed? The sight of this empty-headed dandified "masher"\r\nembittered me, and I reminded him rather brutally of ten shilling he\r\nhad borrowed from me. But before he could reply I regretted that I had\r\nasked for it. I got ashamed and avoided meeting his eyes, and, as a\r\nlady came by just then, I stepped hastily aside to let her pass, and\r\nseized the opportunity to proceed on my way.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do with myself whilst I waited? I could not visit a cafe\r\nwith empty pockets, and I knew of no acquaintance that I could call on\r\nat this time of day. I wended my way instinctively up town, killed a\r\ngood deal of time between the marketplace and the Graendsen, read the\r\n_Aftenpost,_ which was newly posted up on the board outside the office,\r\ntook a turn down Carl Johann, wheeled round and went straight on to Our\r\nSaviour\'s Cemetery, where I found a quiet seat on the slope near the\r\nMortuary Chapel.\r\n\r\nI sat there in complete quietness, dozed in the damp air, mused,\r\nhalf-slept and shivered.\r\n\r\nAnd time passed. Now, was it certain that the story really was a little\r\nmasterpiece of inspired art? God knows if it might not have its faults\r\nhere and there. All things well weighed, it was not certain that it\r\nwould be accepted; no, simply not even accepted. It was perhaps\r\nmediocre enough in its way, perhaps downright worthless. What security\r\nhad I that it was not already at this moment lying in the waste-paper\r\nbasket?... My confidence was shaken. I sprang up and stormed out of the\r\ngraveyard.\r\n\r\nDown in Akersgaden I peeped into a shop window, and saw that it was\r\nonly a little past noon. There was no use in looking up the editor\r\nbefore four. The fate of my story filled me with gloomy forebodings;\r\nthe more I thought about it the more absurd it seemed to me that I\r\ncould have written anything useable with such suddenness, half-asleep,\r\nwith my brain full of fever and dreams. Of course I had deceived myself\r\nand been happy all through the long morning for nothing!... Of\r\ncourse!... I rushed with hurried strides up Ullavold-sveien, past St.\r\nHan\'s Hill, until I came to the open fields; on through the narrow\r\nquaint lanes in Sagene, past waste plots and small tilled fields, and\r\nfound myself at last on a country road, the end of which I could not\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nHere I halted and decided to turn.\r\n\r\nI was warm from the walk, and returned slowly and very downcast. I met\r\ntwo hay-carts. The drivers were lying flat upon the top of their loads,\r\nand sang. Both were bare-headed, and both had round, care-free faces. I\r\npassed them and thought to myself that they were sure to accost me,\r\nsure to fling some taunt or other at me, play me some trick; and as I\r\ngot near enough, one of them called out and asked what I had under my\r\narm?\r\n\r\n"A blanket!"\r\n\r\n"What o\'clock is it?" he asked then.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know rightly; about three, I think!" Whereupon they both\r\nlaughed and drove on. I felt at the same moment the lash of a whip curl\r\nround one of my ears, and my hat was jerked off. They couldn\'t let me\r\npass without playing me a trick. I raised my hand to my head more or\r\nless confusedly, picked my hat out of the ditch, and continued on my\r\nway. Down at St. Han\'s Hill I met a man who told me it was past four.\r\nPast four! already past four! I mended my pace, nearly ran down to the\r\ntown, turned off towards the news office. Perhaps the editor had been\r\nthere hours ago, and had left the office by now. I ran, jostled against\r\nfolk, stumbled, knocked against cars, left everybody behind me,\r\ncompeted with the very horses, struggled like a madman to arrive there\r\nin time. I wrenched through the door, took the stairs in four bounds,\r\nand knocked.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n"He has left, he has left," I think. I try the door which is open,\r\nknock once again, and enter. The editor is sitting at his table, his\r\nface towards the window, pen in hand, about to write. When he hears my\r\nbreathless greeting he turns half round, steals a quick look at me,\r\nshakes his head, and says:\r\n\r\n"Oh, I haven\'t found time to read your sketch yet."\r\n\r\nI am so delighted, because in that case he has not rejected it, that I\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n"Oh, pray, sir, don\'t mention it. I quite understand--there is no\r\nhurry; in a few days, perhaps--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall see; besides, I have your address."\r\n\r\nI forgot to inform him that I no longer had an address, and the\r\ninterview is over. I bow myself out, and leave. Hope flames up again in\r\nme; as yet, nothing is lost--on the contrary, I might, for that matter,\r\nyet win all. And my brain began to spin a romance about a great council\r\nin Heaven, in which it had just been resolved that I should win--ay,\r\ntriumphantly win ten shillings for a story.\r\n\r\nIf I only had some place in which to take refuge for the night! I\r\nconsider where I can stow myself away, and am so absorbed in this query\r\nthat I come to a standstill in the middle of the street. I forget where\r\nI am, and pose like a solitary beacon on a rock in mid-sea, whilst the\r\ntides rush and roar about it.\r\n\r\nA newspaper boy offers me _The Viking_.\r\n\r\n"It\'s real good value, sir!"\r\n\r\nI look up and start; I am outside Semb\'s shop again. I quickly turn to\r\nthe right-about, holding the parcel in front of me, and hurry down\r\nKirkegaden, ashamed and afraid that any one might have seen me from the\r\nwindow. I pass by Ingebret\'s and the theatre, turn round by the\r\nbox-office, and go towards the sea, near the fortress. I find a seat\r\nonce more, and begin to consider afresh.\r\n\r\nWhere in the world shall I find a shelter for the night?\r\n\r\nWas there a hole to be found where I could creep in and hide myself\r\ntill morning? My pride forbade my returning to my lodging--besides, it\r\ncould never really occur to me to go back on my word; I rejected this\r\nthought with great scorn, and I smiled superciliously as I thought of\r\nthe little red rocking-chair. By some association of ideas, I find\r\nmyself suddenly transported to a large, double room I once occupied in\r\nHaegdehaugen. I could see a tray on the table, filled with great slices\r\nof bread-and-butter. The vision changed; it was transformed into\r\nbeef--a seductive piece of beef--a snow-white napkin, bread in plenty,\r\na silver fork. The door opened; enter my landlady, offering me more\r\ntea....\r\n\r\nVisions; senseless dreams! I tell myself that were I to get food now my\r\nhead would become dizzy once more, fever would fill my brain, and I\r\nwould have to fight again against many mad fancies. I could not stomach\r\nfood, my inclination did not lie that way; that was peculiar to me--an\r\nidiosyncrasy of mine.\r\n\r\nMaybe as night drew on a way could be found to procure shelter. There\r\nwas no hurry; at the worst, I could seek a place out in the woods. I\r\nhad the entire environs of the city at my disposal; as yet, there was\r\nno degree of cold worth speaking of in the weather.\r\n\r\nAnd outside there the sea rocked in drowsy rest; ships and clumsy,\r\nbroad-nosed prams ploughed graves in its bluish surface, and scattered\r\nrays to the right and left, and glided on, whilst the smoke rolled up\r\nin downy masses from the chimney-stacks, and the stroke of the engine\r\npistons pierced the clammy air with a dull sound. There was no sun and\r\nno wind; the trees behind me were almost wet, and the seat upon which I\r\nsat was cold and damp.\r\n\r\nTime went. I settled down to doze, waxed tired, and a little shiver ran\r\ndown my back. A while after I felt that my eyelids began to droop, and\r\nI let them droop....\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke it was dark all around me. I started up, bewildered and\r\nfreezing. I seized my parcel and commenced to walk. I went faster and\r\nfaster in order to get warm, slapped my arms, chafed my legs--which by\r\nnow I could hardly feel under me--and thus reached the watch-house of\r\nthe fire brigade. It was nine o\'clock; I had been asleep for several\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWhatever shall I do with myself? I must go to some place. I stand there\r\nand stare up at the watch-house, and query if it would not be possible\r\nto succeed in getting into one of the passages if I were to watch for a\r\nmoment when the watchman\'s back was turned. I ascend the steps, and\r\nprepare to open a conversation with the man. He lifts his ax in salute,\r\nand waits for what I may have to say. The uplifted ax, with its edge\r\nturned against me, darts like a cold slash through my nerves. I stand\r\ndumb with terror before this armed man, and draw involuntarily back. I\r\nsay nothing, only glide farther and farther away from him. To save\r\nappearances I draw my hand over my forehead, as if I had forgotten\r\nsomething or other, and slink away. When I reached the pavement I felt\r\nas much saved as if I had just escaped a great peril, and I hurried\r\naway.\r\n\r\nCold and famished, more and more miserable in spirit, I flew up Carl\r\nJohann. I began to swear out aloud, troubling myself not a whit as to\r\nwhether any one heard me or not. Arrived at Parliament House, just near\r\nthe first trees, I suddenly, by some association of ideas, bethought\r\nmyself of a young artist I knew, a stripling I had once saved from an\r\nassault in the Tivoli, and upon whom I had called later on. I snap my\r\nfingers gleefully, and wend my way to Tordenskjiolds Street, find the\r\ndoor, on which is fastened a card with C. Zacharias Bartel on it, and\r\nknock.\r\n\r\nHe came out himself, and smelt so fearfully of ale and tobacco that it\r\nwas horrible.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening!" I say.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening! is that you? Now, why the deuce do you come so late? It\r\ndoesn\'t look at all its best by lamplight. I have added a hayrick to it\r\nsince, and have made a few other alterations. You must see it by\r\ndaylight; there is no use our trying to see it now!"\r\n\r\n"Let me have a look at it now, all the same," said I; though, for that\r\nmatter, I did not in the least remember what picture he was talking\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Absolutely impossible," he replied; "the whole thing will look yellow;\r\nand, besides, there\'s another thing"--and he came towards me,\r\nwhispering: "I have a little girl inside this evening, so it\'s clearly\r\nimpracticable."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, in that case, of course there\'s no question about it."\r\n\r\nI drew back, said good-night, and went away.\r\n\r\nSo there was no way out of it but to seek some place out in the woods.\r\nIf only the fields were not so damp. I patted my blanket, and felt more\r\nand more at home at the thought of sleeping out. I had worried myself\r\nso long trying to find a shelter in town that I was wearied and bored\r\nwith the whole affair. It would be a positive pleasure to get to rest,\r\nto resign myself; so I loaf down the street without thought in my head.\r\nAt a place in Haegdehaugen I halted outside a provision shop where some\r\nfood was displayed in the window. A cat lay there and slept beside a\r\nround French roll. There was a basin of lard and several basins of meal\r\nin the background. I stood a while and gazed at these eatables; but as\r\nI had no money wherewith to buy, I turned quickly away and continued my\r\ntramp. I went very slowly, passed by Majorstuen, went on, always on--it\r\nseemed to me for hours,--and came at length at Bogstad\'s wood.\r\n\r\nI turned off the road here, and sat down to rest. Then I began to look\r\nabout for a place to suit me, to gather together heather and juniper\r\nleaves, and make up a bed on a little declivity where it was a bit dry.\r\nI opened the parcel and took out the blanket; I was tired and exhausted\r\nwith the long walk, and lay down at once. I turned and twisted many\r\ntimes before I could get settled. My ear pained me a little--it was\r\nslightly swollen from the whip-lash--and I could not lie on it. I\r\npulled off my shoes and put them under my head, with the paper from\r\nSemb on top.\r\n\r\nAnd the great spirit of darkness spread a shroud over me ... everything\r\nwas silent--everything. But up in the heights soughed the everlasting\r\nsong, the voice of the air, the distant, toneless humming which is\r\nnever silent. I listened so long to this ceaseless faint murmur that it\r\nbegan to bewilder me; it was surely a symphony from the rolling spheres\r\nabove. Stars that intone a song....\r\n\r\n"I am damned if it is, though," I exclaimed; and I laughed aloud to\r\ncollect my wits. "They\'re night-owls hooting in Canaan!"\r\n\r\nI rose again, pulled on my shoes, and wandered about in the gloom, only\r\nto lay down once more. I fought and wrestled with anger and fear until\r\nnearly dawn, then fell asleep at last.\r\n\r\n       *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight when I opened my eyes, and I had a feeling that\r\nit was going on towards noon.\r\n\r\nI pulled on my shoes, packed up the blanket again, and set out for\r\ntown. There was no sun to be seen today either; I shivered like a dog,\r\nmy feet were benumbed, and water commenced to run from my eyes, as if\r\nthey could not bear the daylight.\r\n\r\nIt was three o\'clock. Hunger began to assail me downright in earnest. I\r\nwas faint, and now and again I had to retch furtively. I swung round by\r\nthe Dampk\xc3\xb6kken, [Footnote: Steam cooking-kitchen and famous cheap\r\neating-house] read the bill of fare, and shrugged my shoulders in a way\r\nto attract attention, as if corned beef or salt port was not meet food\r\nfor me. After that I went towards the railway station.\r\n\r\nA singular sense of confusion suddenly darted through my head. I\r\nstumbled on, determined not to heed it; but I grew worse and worse, and\r\nwas forced at last to sit down on a step. My whole being underwent a\r\nchange, as if something had slid aside in my inner self, or as if a\r\ncurtain or tissue of my brain was rent in two.\r\n\r\nI was not unconscious; I felt that my ear was gathering a little, and,\r\nas an acquaintance passed by, I recognized him at once and got up and\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\nWhat sore of fresh, painful perception was this that was being added to\r\nthe rest? Was it a consequence of sleeping in the sodden fields, or did\r\nit arise from my not having had any breakfast yet? Looking the whole\r\nthing squarely in the face, there was no meaning in living on in this\r\nmanner, by Christ\'s holy pains, there wasn\'t. I failed to see either\r\nhow I had made myself deserving of this special persecution; and it\r\nsuddenly entered my head that I might just as well turn rogue at once\r\nand go to my "Uncle\'s" with the blanket. I could pawn it for a\r\nshilling, and get three full meals, and so keep myself going until I\r\nthought of something else. \'Tis true I would have to swindle Hans\r\nPauli. I was already on my way to the pawn-shop, but stopped outside\r\nthe door, shook my head irresolutely, then turned back. The farther\r\naway I got the more gladsome, ay, delighted I became, that I had\r\nconquered this strong temptation. The consciousness that I was yet pure\r\nand honourable rose to my head, filled me with a splendid sense of\r\nhaving principle, character, of being a shining white beacon in a\r\nmuddy, human sea amidst floating wreck.\r\n\r\nPawn another man\'s property for the sake of a meal, eat and drink one\'s\r\nself to perdition, brand one\'s soul with the first little scar, set the\r\nfirst black mark against one\'s honour, call one\'s self a blackguard to\r\none\'s own face, and needs must cast one\'s eyes down before one\'s self?\r\nNever! never! It could never have been my serious intention--it had\r\nreally never seriously taken hold of me; in fact, I could not be\r\nanswerable for every loose, fleeting, desultory thought, particularly\r\nwith such a headache as I had, and nearly killed carrying a blanket,\r\ntoo, that belonged to another fellow.\r\n\r\nThere would surely be some way or another of getting help when the\r\nright time came! Now, there was the grocer in Groenlandsleret. Had I\r\nimportuned him every hour in the day since I sent in my application?\r\nHad I rung the bell early and late, and been turned away? Why, I had\r\nnot even applied personally to him or sought an answer! It did not\r\nfollow, surely, that it must needs be an absolutely vain attempt.\r\n\r\nMaybe I had luck with me this time. Luck often took such a devious\r\ncourse, and I started for Groenlandsleret.\r\n\r\nThe last spasm that had darted through my head had exhausted me a\r\nlittle, and I walked very slowly and thought over what I would say to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was a good soul; if the whim seized him he might pay me for\r\nmy work a shilling in advance, even without my asking for it. People of\r\nthat sort had sometimes the most capital ideas.\r\n\r\nI stole into a doorway and blackened the knees of my trousers with\r\nspittle to try and make them look a little respectable, left the parcel\r\nbehind me in a dark corner at the back of a chest, and entered the\r\nlittle shop.\r\n\r\nA man is standing pasting together bags made of old newspaper.\r\n\r\n"I would like to see Mr. Christie," I said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s me!" replied the man.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" Well, my name was so-and-so. I had taken the liberty of\r\nsending him an application, I did not know if it had been of any use.\r\n\r\nHe repeated my name a couple of times and commenced to laugh.\r\n\r\n"Well now, you shall see," he said, taking my letter out of his\r\nbreast-pocket, "if you will just be good enough to see how you deal\r\nwith dates, sir. You dated your letter 1848," and the man roared with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that was rather a mistake," I said, abashed--a distraction, a\r\nwant of thought; I admitted it.\r\n\r\n"You see I must have a man who, as a matter of fact, makes no mistakes\r\nin figures," said he. "I regret it, your handwriting is clear, and I\r\nlike your letter, too, but--"\r\n\r\nI waited a while; this could not possibly be the man\'s final say. He\r\nbusied himself again with the bags.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was a pity," I said; "really an awful pity, but of course it\r\nwould not occur again; and, after all, surely this little error could\r\nnot have rendered me quite unfit to keep books?"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t say that," he answered, "but in the meantime it had so\r\nmuch weight with me that I decided at once upon another man."\r\n\r\n"So the place is filled?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"A--h, well, then there\'s nothing more to be said about it!"\r\n\r\n"No! I\'m sorry, but--"\r\n\r\n"Good-evening!" said I.\r\n\r\nFury welled up in me, blazing with brutal strength. I fetched my parcel\r\nfrom the entry, set my teeth together, jostled against the peaceful\r\nfolk on the footpath, and never once asked their pardon.\r\n\r\nAs one man stopped and set me to rights rather sharply for my\r\nbehaviour, I turned round and screamed a single meaningless word in his\r\near, clenched my fist right under his nose, and stumbled on, hardened\r\nby a blind rage that I could not control.\r\n\r\nHe called a policeman, and I desired nothing better than to have one\r\nbetween my hands just for one moment. I slackened my pace intentionally\r\nin order to give him an opportunity of overtaking me; but he did not\r\ncome. Was there now any reason whatever that absolutely every one of\r\none\'s most earnest and most persevering efforts should fail? Why, too,\r\nhad I written 1848? In what way did that infernal date concern me? Here\r\nI was going about starving, so that my entrails wriggle together in me\r\nlike worms, and it was, as far as I knew, not decreed in the book of\r\nfate that anything in the shape of food would turn up later on in the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI was becoming mentally and physically more and more prostrate; I was\r\nletting myself down each day to less and less honest actions, so that I\r\nlied on each day without blushing, cheated poor people out of their\r\nrent, struggled with the meanest thoughts of making away with other\r\nmen\'s blankets--all without remorse or prick of conscience.\r\n\r\nFoul places began to gather in my inner being, black spores which\r\nspread more and more. And up in Heaven God Almighty sat and kept a\r\nwatchful eye on me, and took heed that _my_ destruction proceeded in\r\naccordance with all the rules of art, uniformly and gradually, without\r\na break in the measure.\r\n\r\nBut in the abysses of hell the angriest devils bristled with range\r\nbecause it lasted such a long time until I committed a mortal sin, an\r\nunpardonable offence for which God in His justice must cast me--down....\r\n\r\nI quickened my pace, hurried faster and faster, turned suddenly to the\r\nleft and found myself, excited and angry, in a light ornate doorway. I\r\ndid not pause, not for one second, but the whole peculiar ornamentation\r\nof the entrance struck on my perception in a flash; every detail of the\r\ndecoration and the tiling of the floor stood clear on my mental vision\r\nas I sprang up the stairs. I rang violently on the second floor. Why\r\nshould I stop exactly on the second floor? And why just seize hold of\r\nthis bell which was some little way from the stairs?\r\n\r\nA young lady in a grey gown with black trimming came out and opened the\r\ndoor. She looked for a moment in astonishment at me, then shook her\r\nhead and said:\r\n\r\n"No, we have not got anything today," and she made a feint to close the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nWhat induced me to thrust myself in this creature\'s way? She took me\r\nwithout further ado for a beggar.\r\n\r\nI got cool and collected at once. I raised my hat, made a respectful\r\nbow, and, as if I had not caught her words, said, with the utmost\r\npoliteness:\r\n\r\n"I hope you will excuse me, madam, for ringing so hard, the bell was\r\nnew to me. Is it not here that an invalid gentleman lives who has\r\nadvertised for a man to wheel him about in a chair?"\r\n\r\nShe stood awhile and digested this mendacious invention and seemed to\r\nbe irresolute in her summing up of my person.\r\n\r\n"No!" she said at length; "no, there is no invalid gentleman living\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Not really? An elderly gentleman--two hours a day--sixpence an hour?"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! in that case, I again ask pardon," said I. "It is perhaps on the\r\nfirst floor. I only wanted, in any case, to recommend a man I know, in\r\nwhom I am interested; my name is Wedel-Jarlsberg," [Footnote: The last\r\nfamily bearing title of nobility in Norway.] and I bowed again and drew\r\nback. The young lady blushed crimson, and in her embarrassment could\r\nnot stir from the spot, but stood and stared after me as I descended\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\nMy calm had returned to me, and my head was clear. The lady\'s saying\r\nthat she had nothing for me today had acted upon me like an icy shower.\r\nSo it had gone so far with me that any one might point at me, and say\r\nto himself, "There goes a beggar--one of those people who get their\r\nfood handed out to them at folk\'s back-doors!"\r\n\r\nI halted outside an eating-house in M\xc3\xb6ller Street, and sniffed the\r\nfresh smell of meat roasting inside; my hand was already upon the\r\ndoor-handle, and I was on the point of entering without any fixed\r\npurpose, when I bethought myself in time, and left the spot. On\r\nreaching the market, and seeking for a place to rest for a little, I\r\nfound all the benches occupied, and I sought in vain all round outside\r\nthe church for a quiet seat, where I could sit down.\r\n\r\nNaturally, I told myself, gloomily--naturally, naturally; and I\r\ncommenced to walk again. I took a turn round the fountain at the corner\r\nof the bazaar, and swallowed a mouthful of water. On again, dragging\r\none foot after the other; stopped for a long time before each shop\r\nwindow; halted, and watched every vehicle that drove by. I felt a\r\nscorching heat in my head, and something pulsated strangely in my\r\ntemples. The water I had drunk disagreed with me fearfully, and I\r\nretched, stopping here and there to escape being noticed in the open\r\nstreet. In this manner I came up to Our Saviour\'s Cemetery.\r\n\r\nI sat down here, with my elbows on my knees and my head in my hands. In\r\nthis cramped position I was more at ease, and I no longer felt the\r\nlittle gnawing in my chest.\r\n\r\nA stone-cutter lay on his stomach on a large slab of granite, at the\r\nside of me, and cut inscriptions. He had blue spectacles on, and\r\nreminded me of an acquaintance of mine, whom I had almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nIf I could only knock all shame on the head and apply to him. Tell him\r\nthe truth right out, that things were getting awfully tight with me\r\nnow; ay, that I found it hard enough to keep alive. I could give him my\r\nshaving-tickets.\r\n\r\nZounds! my shaving-tickets; tickets for nearly a shilling. I search\r\nnervously for this precious treasure. As I do not find them quickly\r\nenough, I spring to my feet and search, in a sweat of fear. I discover\r\nthem at last in the bottom of my breast-pocket, together with other\r\npapers--some clean, some written on--of no value.\r\n\r\nI count these six tickets over many times, backwards and forwards; I\r\nhad not much use for them; it might pass for a whim--a notion of\r\nmine--that I no longer cared to get shaved.\r\n\r\nI was saved to the extent of sixpence--a white sixpence of Kongsberg\r\nsilver. The bank closed at six; I could watch for my man outside the\r\nOpland Caf\xc3\xa9 between seven and eight.\r\n\r\nI sat, and was for a long time pleased with this thought. Time went.\r\nThe wind blew lustily through the chestnut trees around me, and the day\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nAfter all, was it not rather petty to come slinking up with six\r\nshaving-tickets to a young gentleman holding a good position in a bank?\r\nPerhaps, he had already a book, maybe two, quite full of spick and span\r\ntickets, a contrast to the crumpled ones I held.\r\n\r\nWho could tell? I felt in all my pockets for anything else I could let\r\ngo with them, but found nothing. If I could only offer him my tie? I\r\ncould well do without it if I buttoned my coat tightly up, which, by\r\nthe way, I was already obliged to do, as I had no waistcoat. I untied\r\nit--it was a large overlapping bow which hid half my chest,--brushed it\r\ncarefully, and folded it up in a piece of clean white writing-paper,\r\ntogether with the tickets. Then I left the churchyard and took the road\r\nleading to the Opland.\r\n\r\nIt was seven by the Town Hall clock. I walked up and down hard by the\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9, kept close to the iron railings, and kept a sharp watch on all\r\nwho went in and came out of the door. At last, about eight o\'clock, I\r\nsaw the young fellow, fresh, elegantly dressed, coming up the hill and\r\nacross to the cafe door. My heart fluttered like a little bird in my\r\nbreast as I caught sight of him, and I blurted out, without even a\r\ngreeting:\r\n\r\n"Sixpence, old friend!" I said, putting on cheek; "here is the worth of\r\nit," and I thrust the little packet into his hand.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t got it," he exclaimed. "God knows if I have!" and he turned\r\nhis purse inside out right before my eyes. "I was out last night and\r\ngot totally cleared out! You must believe me, I literally haven\'t got\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"No, no, my dear fellow; I suppose it is so," I answered, and I took\r\nhis word for it. There was, indeed, no reason why he should lie about\r\nsuch a trifling matter. It struck me, too, that his blue eyes were\r\nmoist whilst he ransacked his pockets and found nothing. I drew back.\r\n"Excuse me," I said; "it was only just that I was a bit hard up." I was\r\nalready a piece down the street, when he called after me about the\r\nlittle packet. "Keep it! keep it," I answered; "you are welcome to it.\r\nThere are only a few trifles in it--a bagatelle; about all I own in the\r\nworld," and I became so touched at my own words, they sounded so\r\npathetic in the twilight, that I fell a-weeping....\r\n\r\nThe wind freshened, the clouds chased madly across the heavens, and it\r\ngrew cooler and cooler as it got darker. I walked, and cried as I\r\nwalked, down the whole street; felt more and more commiseration with\r\nmyself, and repeated, time after time, a few words, an ejaculation,\r\nwhich called forth fresh tears whenever they were on the point of\r\nceasing: "Lord God, I feel so wretched! Lord God, I feel so wretched!"\r\n\r\nAn hour passed; passed with such strange slowness, such weariness. I\r\nspent a long time in Market Street; sat on steps, stole into doorways,\r\nand when any one approached, stood and stared absently into the shops\r\nwhere people bustled about with wares or money. At last I found myself\r\na sheltered place, behind a deal hoarding, between the church and the\r\nbazaar.\r\n\r\nNo; I couldn\'t go out into the woods again this evening. Things must\r\ntake their course. I had not strength enough to go, and it was such an\r\nendless way there. I would kill the night as best I could, and remain\r\nwhere I was; if it got all too cold, well, I could walk round the\r\nchurch. I would not in any case worry myself any more about that, and I\r\nleant back and dozed.\r\n\r\nThe noise around me diminished; the shops closed. The steps of the\r\npedestrians sounded more and more rarely, and in all the windows about\r\nthe lights went out. I opened my eyes, and became aware of a figure\r\nstanding in front of me. The flash of shining buttons told me it was a\r\npoliceman, though I could not see the man\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Good-night," he said.\r\n\r\n"Good-night," I answered and got afraid.\r\n\r\n"Where do you live?" he queried.\r\n\r\nI name, from habit, and without thought, my old address, the little\r\nattic.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stood for a while.\r\n\r\n"Have I done anything wrong?" I asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n"No, not at all!" he replied; "but you had perhaps better be getting\r\nhome now; it\'s cold lying here."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s true; I feel it is a little chilly." I said good-night, and\r\ninstinctively took the road to my old abode. If I only set about it\r\ncarefully, I might be able to get upstairs without being heard; there\r\nwere eight steps in all, and only the two top ones creaked under my\r\ntread. Down at the door I took off my shoes, and ascended. It was quiet\r\neverywhere. I could hear the slow tick-tack of a clock, and a child\r\ncrying a little. After that I heard nothing. I found my door, lifted\r\nthe latch as I was accustomed to do, entered the room, and shut the\r\ndoor noiselessly after me.\r\n\r\nEverything was as I had left it. The curtains were pulled aside from\r\nthe windows, and the bed stood empty. I caught a glimpse of a note\r\nlying on the table; perhaps it was my note to the landlady--she might\r\nnever have been up here since I went away.\r\n\r\nI fumbled with my hands over the white spot, and felt, to my\r\nastonishment, that it was a letter. I take it over to the window,\r\nexamine as well as it is possible in the dark the badly-written letters\r\nof the address, and make out at least my own name. Ah, I thought, an\r\nanswer from my landlady, forbidding me to enter the room again if I\r\nwere for sneaking back.\r\n\r\nSlowly, quite slowly I left the room, carrying my shoes in one hand,\r\nthe letter in the other, and the blanket under my arm. I draw myself\r\nup, set my teeth as I tread on the creaking steps, get happily down the\r\nstairs, and stand once more at the door. I put on my shoes, take my\r\ntime with the laces, sit a while quietly after I\'m ready, and stare\r\nvacantly before me, holding the letter in my hand. Then I get up and go.\r\n\r\nThe flickering ray of a gas lamp gleams up the street. I make straight\r\nfor the light, lean my parcel against the lamp-post and open the\r\nletter. All this with the utmost deliberation. A stream of light, as it\r\nwere, darts through my breast, and I hear that I give a little cry--a\r\nmeaningless sound of joy. The letter was from the editor. My story was\r\naccepted--had been set in type immediately, straight off! A few slight\r\nalterations.... A couple of errors in writing amended.... Worked out\r\nwith talent ... be printed tomorrow ... half-a-sovereign.\r\n\r\nI laughed and cried, took to jumping and running down the street,\r\nstopped, slapped my thighs, swore loudly and solemnly into space at\r\nnothing in particular. And time went.\r\n\r\nAll through the night until the bright dawn I "jodled" about the\r\nstreets and repeated--"Worked out with talent--therefore a little\r\nmasterpiece--a stroke of genius--and half-a-sovereign."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\n\r\nA few weeks later I was out one evening. Once more I had sat out in a\r\nchurchyard and worked at an article for one of the newspapers. But\r\nwhilst I was struggling with it eight o\'clock struck, and darkness\r\nclosed in, and time for shutting the gates.\r\n\r\nI was hungry--very hungry. The ten shillings had, worse luck, lasted\r\nall too short. It was now two, ay, nearly three days since I had eaten\r\nanything, and I felt somewhat faint; holding the pencil even had taxed\r\nme a little. I had half a penknife and a bunch of keys in my pocket,\r\nbut not a farthing.\r\n\r\nWhen the churchyard gate shut I meant to have gone straight home, but,\r\nfrom an instinctive dread of my room--a vacant tinker\'s workshop, where\r\nall was dark and barren, and which, in fact, I had got permission to\r\noccupy for the present--I stumbled on, passed, not caring where I went,\r\nthe Town Hall, right to the sea, and over to a seat near the railway\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nAt this moment not a sad thought troubled me. I forgot my distress, and\r\nfelt calmed by the view of the sea, which lay peaceful and lovely in\r\nthe murkiness. For old habit\'s sake I would please myself by reading\r\nthrough the bit I had just written, and which seemed to my suffering\r\nhead the best thing I had ever done.\r\n\r\nI took my manuscript out of my pocket to try and decipher it, held it\r\nclose up to my eyes, and ran through it, one line after the other. At\r\nlast I got tired, and put the papers back in my pocket. Everything was\r\nstill. The sea stretched away in pearly blueness, and little birds\r\nflitted noiselessly by me from place to place.\r\n\r\nA policeman patrols in the distance; otherwise there is not a soul\r\nvisible, and the whole harbour is hushed in quiet.\r\n\r\nI count my belongings once more--half a penknife, a bunch of keys, but\r\nnot a farthing. Suddenly I dive into my pocket and take the papers out\r\nagain. It was a mechanical movement, an unconscious nervous twitch. I\r\nselected a white unwritten page, and--God knows where I got the notion\r\nfrom--but I made a cornet, closed it carefully, so that it looked as if\r\nit were filled with something, and threw it far out on to the pavement.\r\nThe breeze blew it onward a little, and then it lay still.\r\n\r\nBy this time hunger had begun to assail me in earnest. I sat and looked\r\nat the white paper cornet, which seemed as if it might be bursting with\r\nshining silver pieces, and incited myself to believe that it really did\r\ncontain something. I sat and coaxed myself quite audibly to guess the\r\nsum; if I guessed aright, it was to be mine.\r\n\r\nI imagined the tiny, pretty penny bits at the bottom and the thick\r\nfluted shillings on top--a whole paper cornet full of money! I sat and\r\ngazed at it with wide opened eyes, and urged myself to go and steal it.\r\n\r\nThen I hear the constable cough. What puts it into my head to do the\r\nsame? I rise up from the seat and repeat the cough three times so that\r\nhe may hear it. Won\'t he jump at the corner when he comes. I sat and\r\nlaughed at this trick, rubbed my hands with glee, and swore with\r\nrollicking recklessness. What a disappointment he will get, the dog!\r\nWouldn\'t this piece of villainy make him inclined to sink into hell\'s\r\nhottest pool of torment! I was drunk with starvation; my hunger had\r\nmade me tipsy.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the policeman comes by, clinking his iron heels on\r\nthe pavement, peering on all sides. He takes his time; he has the whole\r\nnight before him; he does not notice the paper bag--not till he comes\r\nquite close to it. Then he stops and stares at it. It looks so white\r\nand so full as it lies there; perhaps a little sum--what? A little sum\r\nof silver money?... and he picks it up. Hum ... it is light--very\r\nlight; maybe an expensive feather; some hat trimming.... He opened it\r\ncarefully with his big hands, and looked in. I laughed, laughed,\r\nslapped my thighs, and laughed, like a maniac. And not a sound issued\r\nfrom my throat; my laughter was hushed and feverish to the intensity of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nClink, clink again over the paving-stones, and the policeman took a\r\nturn towards the landing-stage. I sat there, with tears in my eyes, and\r\nhiccoughed for breath, quite beside myself with feverish merriment. I\r\ncommenced to talk aloud to myself all about the cornet, imitated the\r\npoor policeman\'s movements, peeped into my hollow hand, and repeated\r\nover and over again to myself, "He coughed as he threw it away--he\r\ncoughed as he threw it away." I added new words to these, gave them\r\nadditional point, changed the whole sentence, and made it catching and\r\npiquant. He coughed once--Kheu heu!\r\n\r\nI exhausted myself in weaving variations on these words, and the\r\nevening was far advanced before my mirth ceased. Then a drowsy quiet\r\novercame me; a pleasant languor which I did not attempt to resist. The\r\ndarkness had intensified, and a slight breeze furrowed the pearl-blue\r\nsea. The ships, the masts of which I could see outlined against the\r\nsky, looked with their black hulls like voiceless monsters that\r\nbristled and lay in wait for me. I had no pain--my hunger had taken the\r\nedge off it. In its stead I felt pleasantly empty, untouched by\r\neverything around me, and glad not to be noticed by any one. I put my\r\nfeet up on the seat and leant back. Thus I could best appreciate the\r\nwell-being of perfect isolation. There was not a cloud on my mind, not\r\na feeling of discomfort, and so far as my thought reached, I had not a\r\nwhim, not a desire unsatisfied. I lay with open eyes, in a state of\r\nutter absence of mind. I felt myself charmed away. Moreover, not a\r\nsound disturbed me. Soft darkness had hidden the whole world from my\r\nsight, and buried me in ideal rest. Only the lonely, crooning voice of\r\nsilence strikes in monotones on my ear, and the dark monsters out there\r\nwill draw me to them when night comes, and they will bear me far across\r\nthe sea, through strange lands where no man dwells, and they will bear\r\nme to Princess Ylajali\'s palace, where an undreamt-of grandeur awaits\r\nme, greater than that of any other man. And she herself will be sitting\r\nin a dazzling hall where all is amethyst, on a throne of yellow roses,\r\nand will stretch out her hands to me when I alight; will smile and call\r\nas I approach and kneel: "Welcome, welcome, knight, to me and my land!\r\nI have waited twenty summers for you, and called for you on all bright\r\nnights. And when you sorrowed I have wept here, and when you slept I\r\nhave breathed sweet dreams in you!"... And the fair one clasps my hand\r\nand, holding it, leads me through long corridors where great crowds of\r\npeople cry, "Hurrah!" through bright gardens where three hundred tender\r\nmaidens laugh and play; and through another hall where all is of\r\nemerald; and here the sun shines.\r\n\r\nIn the corridors and galleries choirs of musicians march by, and rills\r\nof perfume are wafted towards me.\r\n\r\nI clasp her hand in mine; I feel the wild witchery of enchantment\r\nshiver through my blood, and I fold my arms around her, and she\r\nwhispers, "Not here; come yet farther!" and we enter a crimson room,\r\nwhere all is of ruby, a foaming glory, in which I faint.\r\n\r\nThen I feel her arms encircle me; her breath fans my face with a\r\nwhispered "Welcome, loved one! Kiss me ... more ... more...."\r\n\r\nI see from my seat stars shooting before my eyes, and my thoughts are\r\nswept away in a hurricane of light....\r\n\r\nI had fallen asleep where I lay, and was awakened by the policeman.\r\nThere I sat, recalled mercilessly to life and misery. My first feeling\r\nwas of stupid amazement at finding myself in the open air; but this was\r\nquickly replaced by a bitter despondency, I was near crying with sorrow\r\nat being still alive. It had rained whilst I slept, and my clothes were\r\nsoaked through and through, and I felt a damp cold in my limbs.\r\n\r\nThe darkness was denser; it was with difficulty that I could\r\ndistinguish the policeman\'s face in front of me.\r\n\r\n"So, that\'s right," he said; "get up now."\r\n\r\nI got up at once; if he had commanded me to lie down again I would have\r\nobeyed too. I was fearfully dejected, and utterly without strength;\r\nadded to that, I was almost instantly aware of the pangs of hunger\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Hold on there!" the policeman shouted after me; "why, you\'re walking\r\noff without your hat, you Juggins! So--h there; now, go on."\r\n\r\n"I indeed thought there was something--something I had forgotten," I\r\nstammered, absently. "Thanks, good-night!" and I stumbled away.\r\n\r\nIf one only had a little bread to eat; one of those delicious little\r\nbrown loaves that one could bite into as one walked along the street;\r\nand as I went on I thought over the particular sort of brown bread that\r\nwould be so unspeakably good to munch. I was bitterly hungry; wished\r\nmyself dead and buried; I got maudlin, and wept.\r\n\r\nThere never was any end to my misery. Suddenly I stopped in the street,\r\nstamped on the pavement, and cursed loudly. What was it he called me? A\r\n"Juggins"? I would just show him what calling me a "Juggins" means. I\r\nturned round and ran back. I felt red-hot with anger. Down the street I\r\nstumbled, and fell, but I paid no heed to it, jumped up again, and ran\r\non. But by the time I reached the railway station I had become so tired\r\nthat I did not feel able to proceed all the way to the landing-stage;\r\nbesides, my anger had cooled down with the run. At length I pulled up\r\nand drew breath. Was it not, after all, a matter of perfect\r\nindifference to me what such a policeman said? Yes; but one couldn\'t\r\nstand everything. Right enough, I interrupted myself; but he knew no\r\nbetter. And I found this argument satisfactory. I repeated twice to\r\nmyself, "He knew no better"; and with that I returned again.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord!" thought I, wrathfully, "what things you do take into your\r\nhead: running about like a madman through the soaking wet streets on\r\ndark nights." My hunger was now tormenting me excruciatingly, and gave\r\nme no rest. Again and again I swallowed saliva to try and satisfy\r\nmyself a little; I fancied it helped.\r\n\r\nI had been pinched, too, for food for ever so many weeks before this\r\nlast period set in, and my strength had diminished considerably of\r\nlate. When I had been lucky enough to raise five shillings by some\r\nmanoeuvre or another they only lasted any time with difficulty; not\r\nlong enough for me to be restored to health before a new hunger period\r\nset in and reduced me again. My back and shoulders caused me the worst\r\ntrouble. I could stop the little gnawing I had in my chest by coughing\r\nhard, or bending well forward as I walked, but I had no remedy for back\r\nand shoulders. Whatever was the reason that things would not brighten\r\nup for me? Was I not just as much entitled to live as any one else? for\r\nexample, as Bookseller Pascha or Steam Agent Hennechen? Had I not two\r\nshoulders like a giant, and two strong hands to work with? and had I\r\nnot, in sooth, even applied for a place as wood-chopper in M\xc3\xb6llergaden\r\nin order to earn my daily bread? Was I lazy? Had I not applied for\r\nsituations, attended lectures, written articles, and worked day and\r\nnight like a man possessed? Had I not lived like a miser, eaten bread\r\nand milk when I had plenty, bread alone when I had little, and starved\r\nwhen I had nothing? Did I live in an hotel? Had I a suite of rooms on\r\nthe first floor? Why, I am living in a loft over a tinker\'s workshop, a\r\nloft already forsaken by God and man last winter, because the snow blew\r\nin. So I could not understand the whole thing; not a bit of it.\r\n\r\nI slouched on, and dwelt upon all this, and there was not as much as a\r\nspark of bitterness or malice or envy in my mind.\r\n\r\nI halted at a paint-shop and gazed into the window. I tried to read the\r\nlabels on a couple of the tins, but it was too dark. Vexed with myself\r\nover this new whim, and excited--almost angry at not being able to make\r\nout what these tins held,--I rapped twice sharply on the window and\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nUp the street I saw a policeman. I quickened my pace, went close up to\r\nhim, and said, without the slightest provocation, "It is ten o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s two," he answered, amazed.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s ten," I persisted; "it is ten o\'clock!" and, groaning with\r\nanger, I stepped yet a pace or two nearer, clenched my fist, and said,\r\n"Listen, do you know what, it\'s ten o\'clock!"\r\n\r\nHe stood and considered a while, summed up my appearance, stared aghast\r\nat me, and at last said, quite gently, "In any case, it\'s about time ye\r\nwere getting home. Would ye like me to go with ye a bit?"\r\n\r\nI was completely disarmed by this man\'s unexpected friendliness. I felt\r\nthat tears sprang to my eyes, and I hastened to reply:\r\n\r\n"No, thank you! I have only been out a little too late in a caf\xc3\xa9. Thank\r\nyou very much all the same!"\r\n\r\nHe saluted with his hand to his helmet as I turned away. His\r\nfriendliness had overwhelmed me, and I cried weakly, because I had not\r\neven a little coin to give him.\r\n\r\nI halted, and looked after him as he went slowly on his way. I struck\r\nmy forehead, and, in measure, as he disappeared from my sight, I cried\r\nmore violently.\r\n\r\nI railed at myself for my poverty, called myself abusive names,\r\ninvented furious designations--rich, rough nuggets--in a vein of abuse\r\nwith which I overwhelmed myself. I kept on at this until I was nearly\r\nhome. On coming to the door I discovered I had dropped my keys.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course," I muttered to myself, "why shouldn\'t I lose my keys?\r\nHere I am, living in a yard where there is a stable underneath and a\r\ntinker\'s workshop up above. The door is locked at night, and no one, no\r\none can open it; therefore, why should I not lose my keys?\r\n\r\n"I am as wet as a dog--a little hungry--ah, just ever such a little\r\nhungry, and slightly, ay, absurdly tired about my knees; therefore, why\r\nshould I not lose them?\r\n\r\n"Why, for that matter, had not the whole house flitted out to Aker by\r\nthe time I came home and wished to enter it?" ... and I laughed to\r\nmyself, hardened by hunger and exhaustion.\r\n\r\nI could hear the horses stamp in the stables, and I could see my window\r\nabove, but I could not open the door, and I could not get in.\r\n\r\nIt had begun to rain again, and I felt the water soak through to my\r\nshoulders. At the Town Hall I was seized by a bright idea. I would ask\r\nthe policeman to open the door. I applied at once to a constable, and\r\nearnestly begged him to accompany me and let me in, if he could.\r\n\r\nYes, if he could, yes! But he couldn\'t; he had no key. The police keys\r\nwere not there; they were kept in the Detective Department.\r\n\r\nWhat was I to do then?\r\n\r\nWell, I could go to an hotel and get a bed!\r\n\r\nBut I really couldn\'t go to an hotel and get a bed; I had not money, I\r\nhad been out--in a caf\xc3\xa9 ... he knew....\r\n\r\nWe stood a while on the Town Hall steps. He considered and examined my\r\npersonal appearance. The rain fell in torrents outside.\r\n\r\n"Well then, you must go to the guard-house and report yourself as\r\nhomeless!" said he.\r\n\r\nHomeless? I hadn\'t thought of that. Yes, by Jove, that was a capital\r\nidea; and I thanked the constable on the spot for the suggestion. Could\r\nI simply go in and say I was homeless?\r\n\r\n"Just that."...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Your name?" inquired the guard.\r\n\r\n"Tangen--Andreas Tangen!"\r\n\r\nI don\'t know why I lied; my thoughts fluttered about disconnectedly and\r\ninspired me with many singular whims, more than I knew what to do with.\r\nI hit upon this out-of-the-way name on the spur of the moment, and\r\nblurted it out without any calculation. I lied without any occasion for\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n"Occupation?"\r\n\r\nThis was driving me into a corner with a vengeance. Occupation! what\r\nwas my occupation? I thought first of turning myself into a tinker--but\r\nI dared not; firstly, I had given myself a name that was not common to\r\nevery and any tinker--besides, I wore _pince-nez_. It suddenly entered\r\nmy head to be foolhardy. I took a step forward and said firmly, almost\r\nsolemnly:\r\n\r\n"A journalist."\r\n\r\nThe guard gave a start before he wrote it down, whilst I stood as\r\nimportant as a homeless Cabinet Minister before the barrier. It roused\r\nno suspicions. The guard understood quite well why I hesitated a little\r\nbefore answering. What did it look like to see a journalist in the\r\nnight guard-house without a roof over his head?\r\n\r\n"On what paper, Herr Tangen?"\r\n\r\n"_Morgenbladet_!" said I. "I have been out a little too late this\r\nevening, more\'s the shame!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we won\'t mention that," he interrupted, with a smile; "when young\r\npeople are out ... we understand!"\r\n\r\nTurning to a policeman, he said, as he rose and bowed politely to me,\r\n"Show this gentleman up to the reserved section. Good-night!"\r\n\r\nI felt ice run down my back at my own boldness, and I clenched my hands\r\nto steady myself a bit. If I only hadn\'t dragged in the _Morgenbladet_.\r\nI knew Friele could show his teeth when he liked, and I was reminded of\r\nthat by the grinding of the key turning in the lock.\r\n\r\n"The gas will burn for ten minutes," remarked the policeman at the door.\r\n\r\n"And then does it go out?"\r\n\r\n"Then it goes out!"\r\n\r\nI sat on the bed and listened to the turning of the key. The bright\r\ncell had a friendly air; I felt comfortably and well sheltered; and\r\nlistened with pleasure to the rain outside--I couldn\'t wish myself\r\nanything better than such a cosy cell. My contentment increased.\r\nSitting on the bed, hat in hand, and with eyes fastened on the gas jet\r\nover in the wall, I gave myself up to thinking over the minutes of my\r\nfirst interview with the police. This was the first time, and how\r\nhadn\'t I fooled them? "Journalist!--Tangen! if you please! and then\r\n_Morgenbladet_!" Didn\'t I appeal straight to his heart with\r\n_Morgenbladet_? "We won\'t mention that! Eh? Sat in state in the\r\nStiftsgaarden till two o\'clock; forgot door-key and a pocket-book with\r\na thousand kroner at home. Show this gentleman up to the reserved\r\nsection!"...\r\n\r\nAll at once out goes the gas with a strange suddenness, without\r\ndiminishing or flickering.\r\n\r\nI sit in the deepest darkness; I cannot see my hand, nor the white\r\nwalls--nothing. There was nothing for it but to go to bed, and I\r\nundressed.\r\n\r\nBut I was not tired from want of sleep, and it would not come to me. I\r\nlay a while gazing into the darkness, this dense mass of gloom that had\r\nno bottom--my thoughts could not fathom it.\r\n\r\nIt seemed beyond all measure dense to me, and I felt its presence\r\noppress me. I closed my eyes, commenced to sing under my breath, and\r\ntossed to and fro, in order to distract myself, but to no purpose. The\r\ndarkness had taken possession of my thoughts and left me not a moment\r\nin peace. Supposing I were myself to be absorbed in darkness; made one\r\nwith it?\r\n\r\nI raise myself up in bed and fling out my arms. My nervous condition\r\nhas got the upper hand of me, and nothing availed, no matter how much I\r\ntried to work against it. There I sat, a prey to the most singular\r\nfantasies, listening to myself crooning lullabies, sweating with the\r\nexertion of striving to hush myself to rest. I peered into the gloom,\r\nand I never in all the days of my life felt such darkness. There was no\r\ndoubt that I found myself here, in face of a peculiar kind of darkness;\r\na desperate element to which no one had hitherto paid attention. The\r\nmost ludicrous thoughts busied me, and everything made me afraid.\r\n\r\nA little hole in the wall at the head of my bed occupies me greatly--a\r\nnail hole. I find the marks in the wall--I feel it, blow into it, and\r\ntry to guess its depth. That was no innocent hole--not at all. It was a\r\ndownright intricate and mysterious hole, which I must guard against!\r\nPossessed by the thought of this hole, entirely beside myself with\r\ncuriosity and fear, I get out of bed and seize hold of my penknife in\r\norder to gauge its depth, and convince myself that it does not reach\r\nright into the next wall.\r\n\r\nI lay down once more to try and fall asleep, but in reality to wrestle\r\nagain with the darkness. The rain had ceased outside, and I could not\r\nhear a sound. I continued for a long time to listen for footsteps in\r\nthe street, and got no peace until I heard a pedestrian go by--to judge\r\nfrom the sound, a constable. Suddenly I snap my fingers many times and\r\nlaugh: "That was the very deuce! Ha--ha!" I imagined I had discovered a\r\nnew word. I rise up in bed and say, "It is not in the language; I have\r\ndiscovered it. \'Kuboa.\' It has letters as a word has. By the benign\r\nGod, man, you have discovered a word!... \'Kuboa\' ... a word of profound\r\nimport."\r\n\r\nI sit with open eyes, amazed at my own find, and laugh for joy. Then I\r\nbegin to whisper; some one might spy on me, and I intended to keep my\r\ndiscovery a secret. I entered into the joyous frenzy of hunger. I was\r\nempty and free from pain, and I gave free rein to my thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn all calmness I revolve things in my mind. With the most singular\r\njerks in my chain of ideas I seek to explain the meaning of my new\r\nword. There was no occasion for it to mean either God or the Tivoli;\r\n[Footnote: Theatre of Varieties, etc., and Garden in Christiania.] and\r\nwho said that it was to signify cattle show? I clench my hands\r\nfiercely, and repeat once again, "Who said that it was to signify\r\ncattle show?" No; on second thoughts, it was not absolutely necessary\r\nthat it should mean padlock, or sunrise. It was not difficult to find a\r\nmeaning for such a word as this. I would wait and see. In the meantime\r\nI could sleep on it.\r\n\r\nI lie there on the stretcher-bed and laugh slily, but say nothing; give\r\nvent to no opinion one way or the other. Some minutes pass over, and I\r\nwax nervous; this new word torments me unceasingly, returns again and\r\nagain, takes up my thoughts, and makes me serious. I had fully formed\r\nan opinion as to what it should not signify, but had come to no\r\nconclusion as to what it should signify. "That is quite a matter of\r\ndetail," I said aloud to myself, and I clutched my arm and reiterated:\r\n"That is quite a matter of detail." The word was found, God be praised!\r\nand that was the principal thing. But ideas worry me without end and\r\nhinder me from falling asleep. Nothing seemed good enough to me for\r\nthis unusually rare word. At length I sit up in bed again, grasp my\r\nhead in both hands, and say, "No! it is just this, it is impossible to\r\nlet it signify emigration or tobacco factory. If it could have meant\r\nanything like that I would have decided upon it long since and taken\r\nthe consequences." No; in reality the word is fitted to signify\r\nsomething psychical, a feeling, a state. Could I not apprehend it? and\r\nI reflect profoundly in order to find something psychical. Then it\r\nseems to me that some one is interposing, interrupting my confab. I\r\nanswer angrily, "Beg pardon! Your match in idiocy is not to be found;\r\nno, sir! Knitting cotton? Ah! go to hell!" Well, really I had to laugh.\r\nMight I ask why should I be forced to let it signify knitting cotton,\r\nwhen I had a special dislike to its signifying knitting cotton? I had\r\ndiscovered the word myself, so, for that matter, I was perfectly within\r\nmy right in letting it signify whatsoever I pleased. As far as I was\r\naware, I had not yet expressed an opinion as to....\r\n\r\nBut my brain got more and more confused. At last I sprang out of bed to\r\nlook for the water-tap. I was not thirsty, but my head was in a fever,\r\nand I felt an instinctive longing for water. When I had drunk some I\r\ngot into bed again, and determined with all my might to settle to\r\nsleep. I closed my eyes and forced myself to keep quiet. I lay thus for\r\nsome minutes without making a movement, sweated and felt my blood jerk\r\nviolently through my veins. No, it was really too delicious the way he\r\nthought to find money in the paper cornet! He only coughed once, too! I\r\nwonder if he is pacing up and down there yet! Sitting on my bench? the\r\npearly blue sea ... the ships....\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes; how could I keep them shut when I could not sleep?\r\nThe same darkness brooded over me; the same unfathomable black eternity\r\nwhich my thoughts strove against and could not understand. I made the\r\nmost despairing efforts to find a word black enough to characterize\r\nthis darkness; a word so horribly black that it would darken my lips if\r\nI named it. Lord! how dark it was! and I am carried back in thought to\r\nthe sea and the dark monsters that lay in wait for me. They would draw\r\nme to them, and clutch me tightly and bear me away by land and sea,\r\nthrough dark realms that no soul has seen. I feel myself on board,\r\ndrawn through waters, hovering in clouds, sinking--sinking.\r\n\r\nI give a hoarse cry of terror, clutch the bed tightly--I had made such\r\na perilous journey, whizzing down through space like a bolt. Oh, did I\r\nnot feel that I was saved as I struck my hands against the wooden\r\nframe! "This is the way one dies!" said I to myself. "Now you will\r\ndie!" and I lay for a while and thought over that I was to die.\r\n\r\nThen I start up in bed and ask severely, "If I found the word, am I not\r\nabsolutely within my right to decide myself what it is to signify?"...\r\nI could hear myself that I was raving. I could hear it now whilst I was\r\ntalking. My madness was a delirium of weakness and prostration, but I\r\nwas not out of my senses. All at once the thought darted through my\r\nbrain that I was insane. Seized with terror, I spring out of bed again,\r\nI stagger to the door, which I try to open, fling myself against it a\r\ncouple of times to burst it, strike my head against the wall, bewail\r\nloudly, bite my fingers, cry and curse....\r\n\r\nAll was quiet; only my own voice echoed from the walls. I had fallen to\r\nthe floor, incapable of stumbling about the cell any longer.\r\n\r\nLying there I catch a glimpse, high up, straight before my eyes, of a\r\ngreyish square in the wall, a suggestion of white, a presage--it must\r\nbe of daylight. I felt it must be daylight, felt it through every pore\r\nin my body. Oh, did I not draw a breath of delighted relief! I flung\r\nmyself flat on the floor and cried for very joy over this blessed\r\nglimpse of light, sobbed for very gratitude, blew a kiss to the window,\r\nand conducted myself like a maniac. And at this moment I was perfectly\r\nconscious of what I was doing. All my dejection had vanished; all\r\ndespair and pain had ceased, and I had at this moment, at least as far\r\nas my thought reached, not a wish unfilled. I sat up on the floor,\r\nfolded my hands, and waited patiently for the dawn.\r\n\r\nWhat a night this had been!\r\n\r\nThat they had not heard any noise! I thought with astonishment. But\r\nthen I was in the reserved section, high above all the prisoners. A\r\nhomeless Cabinet Minister, if I might say so.\r\n\r\nStill in the best of humours, with eyes turned towards the lighter,\r\never lighter square in the wall, I amused myself acting Cabinet\r\nMinister; called myself Von Tangen, and clothed my speech in a dress of\r\nred-tape. My fancies had not ceased, but I was far less nervous. If I\r\nonly had not been thoughtless enough to leave my pocket-book at home!\r\nMight I not have the honour of assisting his Right Honourable the Prime\r\nMinister to bed? And in all seriousness, and with much ceremony I went\r\nover to the stretcher and lay down.\r\n\r\nBy this it was so light that I could distinguish in some degree the\r\noutlines of the cell and, little by little, the heavy handle of the\r\ndoor. This diverted me; the monotonous darkness so irritating in its\r\nimpenetrability that it prevented me from seeing myself was broken; my\r\nblood flowed more quietly; I soon felt my eyes close.\r\n\r\nI was aroused by a couple of knocks on my door. I jumped up in all\r\nhaste, and clad myself hurriedly; my clothes were still wet through\r\nfrom last night.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll report yourself downstairs to the officer on duty," said the\r\nconstable.\r\n\r\nWere there more formalities to be gone through, then? I thought with\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nBelow I entered a large room, where thirty or forty people sat, all\r\nhomeless. They were called up one by one by the registering clerk, and\r\none by one they received a ticket for breakfast. The officer on duty\r\nrepeated constantly to the policeman at his side, "Did he get a ticket?\r\nDon\'t forget to give them tickets; they look as if they wanted a meal!"\r\n\r\nAnd I stood and looked at these tickets, and wished I had one.\r\n\r\n"Andreas Tangen--journalist."\r\n\r\nI advanced and bowed.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear fellow, how did you come here?"\r\n\r\nI explained the whole state of the case, repeated the same story as\r\nlast night, lied without winking, lied with frankness--had been out\r\nrather late, worse luck ... caf\xc3\xa9 ... lost door-key....\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, and he smiled; "that\'s the way! Did you sleep well\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\nI answered, "Like a Cabinet Minister--like a Cabinet Minister!"\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear it," he said, and he stood up. "Good-morning."\r\n\r\nAnd I went!\r\n\r\nA ticket! a ticket for me too! I have not eaten for more than three\r\nlong days and nights. A loaf! But no one offered me a ticket, and I\r\ndared not demand one. It would have roused suspicion at once. They\r\nwould begin to poke their noses into my private affairs, and discover\r\nwho I really was; they might arrest me for false pretences; and so,\r\nwith elevated head, the carriage of a millionaire, and hands thrust\r\nunder my coat-tails, I stride out of the guard-house.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone warmly, early as it was. It was ten o\'clock, and the\r\ntraffic in Young\'s Market was in full swing. Which way should I take? I\r\nslapped my pockets and felt for my manuscript. At eleven I would try\r\nand see the editor. I stand a while on the balustrade, and watch the\r\nbustle under me. Meanwhile, my clothes commenced to steam. Hunger put\r\nin its appearance afresh, gnawed at my breast, clutched me, and gave\r\nsmall, sharp stabs that caused me pain.\r\n\r\nHad I not a friend--an acquaintance whom I could apply to? I ransack my\r\nmemory to find a man good for a penny piece, and fail to find him.\r\n\r\nWell, it was a lovely day, anyway! Sunlight bright and warm surrounded\r\nme. The sky stretched away like a beautiful sea over the Lier mountains.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing it, I was on my way home. I hungered sorely. I found a\r\nchip of wood in the street to chew--that helped a bit. To think that I\r\nhadn\'t thought of that sooner! The door was open; the stable-boy bade\r\nme good-morning as usual.\r\n\r\n"Fine weather," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied. That was all I found to say. Could I ask for the loan\r\nof a shilling? He would be sure to lend it willingly if he could;\r\nbesides that, I had written a letter for him once.\r\n\r\nHe stood and turned something over in his mind before he ventured on\r\nsaying it.\r\n\r\n"Fine weather! Ahem! I ought to pay my landlady today; you wouldn\'t be\r\nso kind as to lend me five shillings, would you? Only for a few days,\r\nsir. You did me a service once before, so you did."\r\n\r\n"No; I really can\'t do it, Jens Olaj," I answered. "Not now--perhaps\r\nlater on, maybe in the afternoon," and I staggered up the stairs to my\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nI flung myself on my bed, and laughed. How confoundedly lucky it was\r\nthat he had forestalled me; my self-respect was saved. Five shillings!\r\nGod bless you, man, you might just as well have asked me for five\r\nshares in the Dampk\xc3\xb6kken, or an estate out in Aker.\r\n\r\nAnd the thought of these five shillings made me laugh louder and\r\nlouder. Wasn\'t I a devil of a fellow, eh? Five shillings! My mirth\r\nincreased, and I gave way to it. Ugh! what a shocking smell of cooking\r\nthere was here--a downright disgustingly strong smell of chops for\r\ndinner, phew! and I flung open the window to let out this beastly\r\nsmell. "Waiter, a plate of beef!" Turning to the table--this miserable\r\ntable that I was forced to support with my knees when I wrote--I bowed\r\nprofoundly, and said:\r\n\r\n"May I ask will you take a glass of wine? No? I am Tangen--Tangen, the\r\nCabinet Minister. I--more\'s the pity--I was out a little late ... the\r\ndoor-key." Once more my thoughts ran without rein in intricate paths. I\r\nwas continually conscious that I talked at random, and yet I gave\r\nutterance to no word without hearing and understanding it. I said to\r\nmyself, "Now you are talking at random again," and yet I could not help\r\nmyself. It was as if one were lying awake, and yet talking in one\'s\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nMy head was light, without pain and without pressure, and my mood was\r\nunshadowed. It sailed away with me, and I made no effort.\r\n\r\n"Come in! Yes, only come right in! As you see everything is of\r\nruby--Ylajali, Ylajali! that swelling crimson silken divan! Ah, how\r\npassionately she breathes. Kiss me--loved one--more--more! Your arms\r\nare like pale amber, your mouth blushes.... Waiter I asked for a plate\r\nof beef!"\r\n\r\nThe sun gleamed in through the window, and I could hear the horses\r\nbelow chewing oats. I sat and mumbled over my chip gaily, glad at heart\r\nas a child.\r\n\r\nI kept all the time feeling for my manuscript. It wasn\'t really in my\r\nthoughts, but instinct told me it was there--\'twas in my blood to\r\nremember it, and I took it out.\r\n\r\nIt had got wet, and I spread it out in the sun to dry; then I took to\r\nwandering up and down the room. How depressing everything looked! Small\r\nscraps of tin shavings were trodden into the floor; there was not a\r\nchair to sit upon, not even a nail in the bare walls. Everything had\r\nbeen brought to my "Uncle\'s," and consumed. A few sheets of paper lying\r\non the table, covered with thick dust, were my sole possession; the old\r\ngreen blanket on the bed was lent to me by Hans Pauli some months\r\nago.... Hans Pauli! I snap my fingers. Hans Pauli Pettersen shall help\r\nme! He would certainly be very angry that I had not appealed to him at\r\nonce. I put on my hat in haste, gather up the manuscript, thrust it\r\ninto my pocket, and hurry downstairs.\r\n\r\n"Listen, Jens Olaj!" I called into the stable, "I am nearly certain I\r\ncan help you in the afternoon."\r\n\r\nArrived at the Town Hall I saw that it was past eleven, and I\r\ndetermined on going to the editor at once. I stopped outside the office\r\ndoor to see if my sheets were paged rightly, smoothed them carefully\r\nout, put them back in my pocket, and knocked. My heart beat audibly as\r\nI entered.\r\n\r\n"Scissors" is there as usual. I inquire timorously for the editor. No\r\nanswer. The man sits and probes for minor items of news amongst the\r\nprovincial papers.\r\n\r\nI repeat my question, and advance a little farther.\r\n\r\n"The editor has not come yet!" said "Scissors" at length, without\r\nlooking up.\r\n\r\nHow soon would he come?\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t say--couldn\'t say at all!"\r\n\r\nHow long would the office be open?\r\n\r\nTo this I received no answer, so I was forced to leave. "Scissors" had\r\nnot once looked up at me during all this scene; he had heard my voice,\r\nand recognized me by it. You are in such bad odour here, thought I,\r\nthat he doesn\'t even take the trouble to answer you. I wonder if that\r\nis an order of the editor\'s. I had, \'tis true enough, right from the\r\nday my celebrated story was accepted for ten shillings, overwhelmed him\r\nwith work, rushed to his door nearly every day with unsuitable things\r\nthat he was obliged to peruse only to return them to me. Perhaps he\r\nwished to put an end to this--take stringent measures.... I took the\r\nroad to Homandsbyen.\r\n\r\nHans Pauli Pettersen was a peasant-farmer\'s son, a student, living in\r\nthe attic of a five-storeyed house; therefore, Hans Pauli Pettersen was\r\na poor man. But if he had a shilling he wouldn\'t stint it. I would get\r\nit just as sure as if I already held it in my hand. And I rejoiced the\r\nwhole time, as I went, over the shilling, and felt confident I would\r\nget it.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to the street door it was closed and I had to ring.\r\n\r\n"I want to see Student Pettersen," I said, and was about to step\r\ninside. "I know his room."\r\n\r\n"Student Pettersen," repeats the girl. "Was it he who had the attic?"\r\nHe had moved.\r\n\r\nWell, she didn\'t know the address; but he had asked his letters to be\r\nsent to Hermansen in Tolbod-gaden, and she mentioned the number.\r\n\r\nI go, full of trust and hope, all the way to Tolbod-gaden to ask Hans\r\nPauli\'s address; being my last chance, I must turn it to account. On\r\nthe way I came to a newly-built house, where a couple of joiners stood\r\nplaning outside. I picked up a few satiny shavings from the heap, stuck\r\none in my mouth, and the other in my pocket for by-and-by, and\r\ncontinued my journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nI groaned with hunger. I had seen a marvellously large penny loaf at a\r\nbaker\'s--the largest I could possibly get for the price.\r\n\r\n"I come to find out Student Pettersen\'s address!"\r\n\r\n"Bernt Akers Street, No. 10, in the attic." Was I going out there?\r\nWell, would I perhaps be kind enough to take out a couple of letters\r\nthat had come for him?\r\n\r\nI trudge up town again, along the same road, pass by the joiners--who\r\nare sitting with their cans between their knees, eating their good warm\r\ndinner from the Dampk\xc3\xb6kken--pass the bakers, where the loaf is still in\r\nits place, and at length reach Bernt Akers Street, half dead with\r\nfatigue. The door is open, and I mount all the weary stairs to the\r\nattic. I take the letters out of my pocket in order to put Hans Pauli\r\ninto a good humour on the moment of my entrance.\r\n\r\nHe would be certain not to refuse to give me a helping hand when I\r\nexplained how things were with me; no, certainly not; Hans Pauli had\r\nsuch a big heart--I had always said that of him.... I discovered his\r\ncard fastened to the door--"H. P. Pettersen, Theological Student, \'gone\r\nhome.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nI sat down without more ado--sat down on the bare floor, dulled with\r\nfatigue, fairly beaten with exhaustion. I mechanically mutter, a couple\r\nof times, "Gone home--gone home!" then I keep perfectly quiet. There\r\nwas not a tear in my eyes; I had not a thought, not a feeling of any\r\nkind. I sat and stared, with wide-open eyes, at the letters, without\r\ncoming to any conclusion. Ten minutes went over--perhaps twenty or\r\nmore. I sat stolidly on the one spot, and did not move a finger. This\r\nnumb feeling of drowsiness was almost like a brief slumber. I hear some\r\none come up the stairs.\r\n\r\n"It was Student Pettersen, I ... I have two letters for him."\r\n\r\n"He has gone home," replies the woman; "but he will return after the\r\nholidays. I could take the letters if you like!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, thanks! that was all right," said I. "He could get them then when\r\nhe came back; they might contain matters of importance. Good-morning."\r\n\r\nWhen I got outside, I came to a standstill and said loudly in the open\r\nstreet, as I clenched my hands: "I will tell you one thing, my good\r\nLord God, you are a bungler!" and I nod furiously, with set teeth, up\r\nto the clouds; "I will be hanged if you are not a bungler."\r\n\r\nThen I took a few strides, and stopped again. Suddenly, changing my\r\nattitude, I fold my hands, hold my head to one side, and ask, with an\r\nunctuous, sanctimonious tone of voice: "Hast thou appealed also to him,\r\nmy child?" It did not sound right!\r\n\r\nWith a large H, I say, with an H as big as a cathedral! once again,\r\n"Hast thou invoked Him, my child?" and I incline my head, and I make my\r\nvoice whine, and answer, No!\r\n\r\nThat didn\'t sound right either.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t play the hypocrite, you idiot! Yes, you should say, I have\r\ninvoked God my Father! and you must set your words to the most piteous\r\ntune you have ever heard in your life. So--o! Once again! Come, that\r\nwas better! But you must sigh like a horse down with the colic. So--o!\r\nthat\'s right. Thus I go, drilling myself in hypocrisy; stamp\r\nimpatiently in the street when I fail to succeed; rail at myself for\r\nbeing such a blockhead, whilst the astonished passers-by turn round and\r\nstare at me.\r\n\r\nI chewed uninterruptedly at my shaving, and proceeded, as steadily as I\r\ncould, along the street. Before I realized it, I was at the railway\r\nsquare. The dock on Our Saviour\'s pointed to half-past one. I stood for\r\na bit and considered. A faint sweat forced itself out on my face, and\r\ntrickled down my eyelids. Accompany me down to the bridge, said I to\r\nmyself--that is to say, if you have spare time!--and I made a bow to\r\nmyself, and turned towards the railway bridge near the wharf.\r\n\r\nThe ships lay there, and the sea rocked in the sunshine. There was\r\nbustle and movement everywhere, shrieking steam-whistles, quay porters\r\nwith cases on their shoulders, lively "shanties" coming from the prams.\r\nAn old woman, a vendor of cakes, sits near me, and bends her brown nose\r\ndown over her wares. The little table before her is sinfully full of\r\nnice things, and I turn away with distaste. She is filling the whole\r\nquay with her smell of cakes--phew! up with the windows!\r\n\r\nI accosted a gentleman sitting at my side, and represented forcibly to\r\nhim the nuisance of having cake-sellers here, cake-sellers there....\r\nEh? Yes; but he must really admit that.... But the good man smelt a\r\nrat, and did not give me time to finish speaking, for he got up and\r\nleft. I rose, too, and followed him, firmly determined to convince him\r\nof his mistake.\r\n\r\n"If it was only out of consideration for sanitary conditions," said I;\r\nand I slapped him on the shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, I am a stranger here, and know nothing of the sanitary\r\nconditions," he replied, and stared at me with positive fear.\r\n\r\nOh, that alters the case! if he was a stranger.... Could I not render\r\nhim a service in any way? show him about? Really not? because it would\r\nbe a pleasure to me, and it would cost him nothing....\r\n\r\nBut the man wanted absolutely to get rid of me, and he sheered off, in\r\nall haste, to the other side of the street.\r\n\r\nI returned to the bench and sat down. I was fearfully disturbed, and\r\nthe big street organ that had begun to grind a tune a little farther\r\naway made me still worse--a regular metallic music, a fragment of\r\nWeber, to which a little girl is singing a mournful strain. The\r\nflute-like sorrowfulness of the organ thrills through my blood; my\r\nnerves vibrate in responsive echo. A moment later, and I fall back on\r\nthe seat, whimpering and crooning in time to it.\r\n\r\nOh, what strange freaks one\'s thoughts are guilty of when one is\r\nstarving. I feel myself lifted up by these notes, dissolved in tones,\r\nand I float out, I feel so clearly. How I float out, soaring high above\r\nthe mountains, dancing through zones of light!...\r\n\r\n"A halfpenny," whines the little organ-girl, reaching forth her little\r\ntin plate; "only a halfpenny."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said, unthinkingly, and I sprang to my feet and ransacked all\r\nmy pockets. But the child thinks I only want to make fun of her, and\r\nshe goes away at once without saying a word.\r\n\r\nThis dumb forbearance was too much for me. If she had abused me, it\r\nwould have been more endurable. I was stung with pain, and recalled her.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t possess a farthing; but I will remember you later on, maybe\r\ntomorrow. What is your name? Yes, that is a pretty name; I won\'t forget\r\nit. Till tomorrow, then...."\r\n\r\nBut I understood quite well that she did not believe me, although she\r\nnever said one word; and I cried with despair because this little\r\nstreet wench would not believe in me.\r\n\r\nOnce again I called her back, tore open my coat, and was about to give\r\nher my waistcoat. "I will make up to you for it," said I; "wait only a\r\nmoment" ... and lo! I had no waistcoat.\r\n\r\nWhat in the world made me look for it? Weeks had gone by since it was\r\nin my possession. What was the matter with me, anyway? The astonished\r\nchild waited no longer, but withdrew fearsomely, and I was compelled to\r\nlet her go. People throng round me, laugh aloud; a policeman thrusts\r\nhis way through to me, and wants to know what is the row.\r\n\r\n"Nothing!" I reply, "nothing at all; I only wanted to give the little\r\ngirl over there my waistcoat ... for her father ... you needn\'t stand\r\nthere and laugh at that ... I have only to go home and put on another."\r\n\r\n"No disturbance in the street," says the constable; "so, march," and he\r\ngives me a shove on.\r\n\r\n"Is them your papers?" he calls after me.\r\n\r\n"Yes, by Jove! my newspaper leader; many important papers! However\r\ncould I be so careless?" I snatch up my manuscript, convince myself\r\nthat it is lying in order and go, without stopping a second or looking\r\nabout me, towards the editor\'s office.\r\n\r\nIt was now four by the clock of Our Saviour\'s Church. The office is\r\nshut. I stead noiselessly down the stairs, frightened as a thief, and\r\nstand irresolutely outside the door. What should I do now? I lean up\r\nagainst the wall, stare down at the stones, and consider. A pin is\r\nlying glistening at my feet; I stoop and pick it up. Supposing I were\r\nto cut the buttons off my coat, how much could I get for them? Perhaps\r\nit would be no use, though buttons are buttons; but yet, I look and\r\nexamine them, and find them as good as new--that was a lucky idea all\r\nthe same; I could cut them off with my penknife and take them to the\r\npawn-office. The hope of being able to sell these five buttons cheered\r\nme immediately, and I cried, "See, see; it will all come right!" My\r\ndelight got the upper hand of me, and I at once set to cut off the\r\nbuttons one by one. Whilst thus occupied, I held the following hushed\r\nsoliloquy:\r\n\r\nYes, you see one has become a little impoverished; a momentary\r\nembarrassment ... worn out, do you say? You must not make slips when\r\nyou speak? I would like to see the person who wears out less buttons\r\nthan I do, I can tell you! I always go with my coat open; it is a habit\r\nof mine, an idiosyncrasy.... No, no; of course, if you _won\'t_, well!\r\nBut I must have a penny for them, at least.... No indeed! who said you\r\nwere obliged to do it? You can hold your tongue, and leave me in\r\npeace.... Yes, well, you can fetch a policeman, can\'t you? I\'ll wait\r\nhere whilst you are out looking for him, and I won\'t steal anything\r\nfrom you. Well, good-day! Good-day! My name, by the way, is Tangen;\r\nhave been out a little late.\r\n\r\nSome one comes up the stairs. I am recalled at once to reality. I\r\nrecognize "Scissors," and put the buttons carefully into my pocket. He\r\nattempts to pass; doesn\'t even acknowledge my nod; is suddenly intently\r\nbusied with his nails. I stop him, and inquire for the editor.\r\n\r\n"Not in, do you hear."\r\n\r\n"You lie," I said, and, with a cheek that fairly amazed myself, I\r\ncontinued, "I must have a word with him; it is a necessary\r\nerrand--communications from the Stiftsgaarden. [Footnote: Dwelling of\r\nthe civil governor of a Stift or diocese.]\r\n\r\n"Well, can\'t you tell me what it is, then?"\r\n\r\n"Tell you?" and I looked "Scissors" up and down. This had the desired\r\neffect. He accompanied me at once, and opened the door. My heart was in\r\nmy mouth now; I set my teeth, to try and revive my courage, knocked,\r\nand entered the editor\'s private office.\r\n\r\n"Good-day! Is it you?" he asked kindly; "sit down."\r\n\r\nIf he had shown me the door it would have been almost as acceptable. I\r\nfelt as if I were on the point of crying and said:\r\n\r\n"I beg you will excuse...."\r\n\r\n"Pray, sit down," he repeated. And I sat down, and explained that I\r\nagain had an article which I was extremely anxious to get into his\r\npaper. I had taken such pains with it; it had cost me much effort.\r\n\r\n"I will read it," said he, and he took it. "Everything you write is\r\ncertain to cost you effort, but you are far too impetuous; if you could\r\nonly be a little more sober. There\'s too much fever. In the meantime, I\r\nwill read it," and he turned to the table again.\r\n\r\nThere I sat. Dared I ask for a shilling? explain to him why there was\r\nalways fever? He would be sure to aid me; it was not the first time.\r\n\r\nI stood up. Hum! But the last time I was with him he had complained\r\nabout money, and had sent a messenger out to scrape some together for\r\nme. Maybe it might be the same case now. No; it should not occur! Could\r\nI not see then that he was sitting at work?\r\n\r\nWas there otherwise anything? he inquired.\r\n\r\n"No," I answered, and I compelled my voice to sound steady. "About how\r\nsoon shall I call in again?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, any time you are passing--in a couple of days or so."\r\n\r\nI could not get my request over my lips. This man\'s friendliness seemed\r\nto me beyond bounds, and I ought to know how to appreciate it. Rather\r\ndie of hunger! I went. Not even when I was outside the door, and felt\r\nonce more the pangs of hunger, did I repent having left the office\r\nwithout having asked for that shilling. I took the other shaving out of\r\nmy pocket and stuck it into my mouth. It helped. Why hadn\'t I done so\r\nbefore? "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," I said aloud. "Could it\r\nreally have entered your head to ask the man for a shilling and put him\r\nto inconvenience again?" and I got downright angry with myself for the\r\neffrontery of which I had almost been guilty. "That is, by God! the\r\nshabbiest thing I ever heard," said I, "to rush at a man and nearly\r\ntear the eyes out of his head just because you happen to need a\r\nshilling, you miserable dog! So--o, march! quicker! quicker! you big\r\nthumping lout; I\'ll teach you." I commenced to run to punish myself,\r\nleft one street after the other behind me at a bound, goaded myself on\r\nwith suppressed cries, and shrieked dumbly and furiously at myself\r\nwhenever I was about to halt. Thus I arrived a long way up Pyle Street,\r\nwhen at last I stood still, almost ready to cry with vexation at not\r\nbeing able to run any farther. I was trembling over my whole body, and\r\nI flung myself down on a step. "No; stop!" I said, and, in order to\r\ntorture myself rightly, I arose again, and forced myself to keep\r\nstanding. I jeered at myself and hugged myself with pleasure at the\r\nspectacle of my own exhaustion. At length, after the lapse of a few\r\nmoments, I gave myself, with a nod, permission to be seated, though,\r\neven then, I chose the most uncomfortable place on the steps.\r\n\r\nLord! how delicious it was to rest! I dried the sweat off my face, and\r\ndrew great refreshing breaths. How had I not run! But I was not sorry;\r\nI had richly deserved it. Why did I want to ask for that shilling? Now\r\nI could see the consequences, and I began to talk mildly to myself,\r\ndealing out admonitions as a mother might have done. I grew more and\r\nmore moved, and tired and weak as I was, I fell a-crying. A quiet,\r\nheart-felt cry; an inner sobbing without a tear.\r\n\r\nI sat for the space of a quarter of an hour, or more, in the same\r\nplace. People came and went, and no one molested me. Little children\r\nplayed about around me, and a little bird sang on a tree on the other\r\nside of the street.\r\n\r\nA policeman came towards me. "Why do you sit here?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Why do I sit here?" I replied; "for pleasure."\r\n\r\n"I have been watching you for the last half-hour. You\'ve sat here now\r\nhalf-an-hour."\r\n\r\n"About that," I replied; "anything more?"\r\n\r\nI got up in a temper and walked on. Arrived at the market-place, I\r\nstopped and gazed down the street. For pleasure. Now, was that an\r\nanswer to give? For weariness, you should have replied, and made your\r\nvoice whining. You are a booby; you will never learn to dissemble. From\r\nexhaustion, and you should have gasped like a horse.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to the fire look-out, I halted afresh, seized by a new idea.\r\nI snapped my fingers, burst into a loud laugh that confounded the\r\npassers-by, and said: "Now you shall just go to Levion the parson. You\r\nshall, as sure as death--ay, just for a try. What have you got to lose\r\nby it? and it is such glorious weather!"\r\n\r\nI entered Pascha\'s book-shop, found Pastor Levion\'s address in the\r\ndirectory, and started for it.\r\n\r\nNow for it! said I. Play no pranks. Conscience, did you say? No\r\nrubbish, if you please. You are too poor to support a conscience. You\r\nare hungry; you have come on important business--the first thing\r\nneedful. But you shall hold your head askew, and set your words to a\r\nsing-song. You won\'t! What? Well then, I won\'t go a step farther. Do\r\nyou hear that? Indeed, you are in a sorely tempted condition, fighting\r\nwith the powers of darkness and great voiceless monsters at night, so\r\nthat it is a horror to think of; you hunger and thirst for wine and\r\nmilk, and don\'t get them. It has gone so far with you. Here you stand\r\nand haven\'t as much as a halfpenny to bless yourself with. But you\r\nbelieve in grace, the Lord be praised; you haven\'t yet lost your faith;\r\nand then you must clasp your hands together, and look a very Satan of a\r\nfellow for believing in grace. As far as Mammon was concerned, why, you\r\nhated Mammon with all its pomps in any form. Now it\'s quite another\r\nthing with a psalm-book--a souvenir to the extent of a few\r\nshillings.... I stopped at the pastor\'s door, and read, "Office hours,\r\n12 to 4."\r\n\r\nMind, no fudge, I said; now we\'ll go ahead in earnest! So hang your\r\nhead a little more, and I rang at the private entrance.\r\n\r\n"I want to see the pastor," said I to the maid; but it was not possible\r\nfor me to get in God\'s name yet awhile.\r\n\r\n"He has gone out."\r\n\r\nGone out, gone out! That destroyed my whole plan; scattered all I\r\nintended to say to the four winds. What had I gained then by the long\r\nwalk? There I stood.\r\n\r\n"Was it anything particular?" questioned the maid.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," I replied, "not at all." It was only just that it was\r\nsuch glorious God\'s weather that I thought I would come out and make a\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nThere I stood, and there she stood. I purposely thrust out my chest to\r\nattract her attention to the pin that held my coat together. I implored\r\nher with a look to see what I had come for, but the poor creature\r\ndidn\'t understand it at all.\r\n\r\nLovely God\'s weather. Was not the mistress at home either?\r\n\r\nYes; but she had gout, and lay on a sofa without being able to move\r\nherself.... Perhaps I would leave a message or something?\r\n\r\nNo, not at all; I only just took walks like this now and again, just\r\nfor exercise; it was so wholesome after dinner.... I set out on the\r\nroad back--what would gossiping longer lead to? Besides, I commenced to\r\nfeel dizzy. There was no mistake about it; I was about to break down in\r\nearnest. Office hours from 12 to 4. I had knocked at the door an hour\r\ntoo late. The time of grace was over. I sat down on one of the benches\r\nnear the church in the market. Lord! how black things began to look for\r\nme now! I did not cry; I was too utterly tired, worn to the last\r\ndegree. I sat there without trying to arrive at any conclusion, sad,\r\nmotionless, and starving. My chest was much inflamed; it smarted most\r\nstrangely and sorely--nor would chewing shavings help me much longer.\r\nMy jaws were tired of that barren work, and I let them rest. I simply\r\ngave up. A brown orange-peel, too, I had found in the street, and which\r\nI had at once commenced to chew, had given me nausea. I was ill--the\r\nveins swelled up bluely on my wrists. What was it I had really sought\r\nafter? Run about the whole live-long day for a shilling, that would but\r\nkeep life in me for a few hours longer. Considering all, was it not a\r\nmatter of indifference if the inevitable took place one day earlier or\r\none day later? If I had conducted myself like an ordinary being I\r\nshould have gone home long ago, and laid myself down to rest, and given\r\nin. My mind was clear for a moment. Now I was to die. It was in the\r\ntime of the fall, and all things were hushed to sleep. I had tried\r\nevery means, exhausted every resource of which I knew. I fondled this\r\nthought sentimentally, and each time I still hoped for a possible\r\nsuccour I whispered repudiatingly: "You fool, you have already begun to\r\ndie."\r\n\r\nI ought to write a couple of letters, make all ready--prepare myself. I\r\nwould wash myself carefully and tidy my bed nicely. I would lay my head\r\nupon the sheets of white paper, the cleanest things I had left, and the\r\ngreen blanket. I ... The green blanket! Like a shot I was wide awake.\r\nThe blood mounted to my head, and I got violent palpitation of the\r\nheart. I arise from the seat, and start to walk. Life stirs again in\r\nall my fibres, and time after time I repeat disconnectedly, "The green\r\nblanket--the green blanket." I go faster and faster, as if it is a case\r\nof fetching something, and stand after a little time in my tinker\'s\r\nworkshop. Without pausing a moment, or wavering in my resolution, I go\r\nover to the bed, and roll up Hans Pauli\'s blanket. It was a strange\r\nthing if this bright idea of mine couldn\'t save me. I rose infinitely\r\nsuperior to the stupid scruples which sprang up in me--half inward\r\ncries about a certain stain on my honour. I bade good-bye to the whole\r\nof them. I was no hero--no virtuous idiot. I had my senses left.\r\n\r\nSo I took the blanket under my arm and went to No. 5 Stener\'s Street. I\r\nknocked, and entered the big, strange room for the first time. The bell\r\non the door above my head gave a lot of violent jerks. A man enters\r\nfrom a side room, chewing, his mouth is full of food, and stands behind\r\nthe counter.\r\n\r\n"Eh, lend me sixpence on my eye-glasses?" said I. "I shall release them\r\nin a couple of days, without fail--eh?"\r\n\r\n"No! they\'re steel, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"No; can\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, no, I suppose you can\'t. Well, it was really at best only a joke.\r\nWell, I have a blanket with me for which, properly speaking, I have no\r\nlonger any use, and it struck me that you might take it off my hands."\r\n\r\n"I have--more\'s the pity--a whole store full of bed-clothes," he\r\nreplied; and when I had opened it he just cast one glance over it and\r\nsaid, "No, excuse me, but I haven\'t any use for that either."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to show you the worse side first," said I; "it\'s much better\r\non the other side."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay; it\'s no good. I won\'t own it; and you wouldn\'t raise a penny\r\non it anywhere."\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s clear it isn\'t worth anything," I said; "but I thought it\r\nmight go with another old blanket at an auction."\r\n\r\n"Well, no; it\'s no use."\r\n\r\n"Three pence?" said I.\r\n\r\n"No; I won\'t have it at all, man! I wouldn\'t have it in the house!" I\r\ntook it under my arm and went home.\r\n\r\nI acted as if nothing had passed, spread it over the bed again,\r\nsmoothed it well out, as was my custom, and tried to wipe away every\r\ntrace of my late action. I could not possibly have been in my right\r\nmind at the moment when I came to the conclusion to commit this\r\nrascally trick. The more I thought over it the more unreasonable it\r\nseemed to me. It must have been an attack of weakness; some relaxation\r\nin my inner self that had surprised me when off my guard. Neither had I\r\nfallen straight into the trap. I had half felt that I was going the\r\nwrong road, and I expressly offered my glasses first, and I rejoiced\r\ngreatly that I had not had the opportunity of carrying into effect this\r\nfault which would have sullied the last hours I had to live.\r\n\r\nI wandered out into the city again. I let myself sink upon one of the\r\nseats by Our Saviour\'s Church; dozed with my head on my breast,\r\napathetic after my last excitement, sick and famished with hunger. And\r\ntime went by.\r\n\r\nI should have to sit out this hour, too. It was a little lighter\r\noutside than in the house, and it seemed to me that my chest did not\r\npain quite so badly out in the open air. I should get home, too, soon\r\nenough--and I dozed, and thought, and suffered fearfully.\r\n\r\nI had found a little pebble; I wiped it clean on my coat sleeve and put\r\nit into my mouth so that I might have something to mumble. Otherwise I\r\ndid not stir, and didn\'t even wink an eyelid. People came and went; the\r\nnoise of cars, the tramp of hoofs, and chatter of tongues filled the\r\nair. I might try with the buttons. Of course there would be no use in\r\ntrying; and besides, I was now in a rather bad way; but when I came to\r\nconsider the matter closely, I would be obliged, as it were, to pass in\r\nthe direction of my "Uncle\'s" as I went home. At last I got up,\r\ndragging myself slowly to my feet, and reeled down the streets. It\r\nbegan to burn over my eyebrows--fever was setting in, and I hurried as\r\nfast as I could. Once more I passed the baker\'s shop where the little\r\nloaf lay. "Well, we must stop here!" I said, with affected decision.\r\nBut supposing I were to go in and beg for a bit of bread? Surely that\r\nwas a fleeting thought, a flash; it could never really have occurred to\r\nme seriously. "Fie!" I whispered to myself, and shook my head, and held\r\non my way. In Rebslager a pair of lovers stood in a doorway and talked\r\ntogether softly; a little farther up a girl popped her head out of a\r\nwindow. I walked so slowly and thoughtfully, that I looked as if I\r\nmight be deep in meditation on nothing in particular, and the wench\r\ncame out into the street. "How is the world treating you, old fellow?\r\nEh, what, are you ill? Nay, the Lord preserve us, what a face!" and she\r\ndrew away frightened. I pulled up at once: What\'s amiss with my face?\r\nHad I really begun to die? I felt over my cheeks with my hand;\r\nthin--naturally, I was thin--my cheeks were like two hollowed bowls;\r\nbut Lord ... I reeled along again, but again came to a standstill; I\r\nmust be quite inconceivably thin. Who knows but that my eyes were\r\nsinking right into my head? How did I look in reality? It was the very\r\ndeuce that one must let oneself turn into a living deformity for sheer\r\nhunger\'s sake. Once more I was seized by fury, a last flaring up, a\r\nfinal spasm. "Preserve me, what a face. Eh?" Here I was, with a head\r\nthat couldn\'t be matched in the whole country, with a pair of fists\r\nthat, by the Lord, could grind a navvy into finest dust, and yet I went\r\nand hungered myself into a deformity, right in the town of Christiania.\r\nWas there any rhyme or reason in that? I had sat in saddle, toiled day\r\nand night like a carrier\'s horse.\r\n\r\nI had read my eyes out of their sockets, had starved the brains out of\r\nmy head, and what the devil had I gained by it? Even a street hussy\r\nprayed God to deliver her from the sight of me. Well, now, there should\r\nbe a stop to it. Do you understand that? Stop it shall, or the devil\r\ntake a worse hold of me.\r\n\r\nWith steadily increasing fury, grinding my teeth under the\r\nconsciousness of my impotence, with tears and oaths I raged on, without\r\nlooking at the people who passed me by. I commenced once more to martyr\r\nmyself, ran my forehead against lamp-posts on purpose, dug my nails\r\ndeep into my palms, bit my tongue with frenzy when it didn\'t articulate\r\nclearly, and laughed insanely each time it hurt much.\r\n\r\nYes; but what shall I do? I asked myself at last, and I stamped many\r\ntimes on the pavement and repeated, What shall I do? A gentleman just\r\ngoing by remarks, with a smile, "You ought to go and ask to be locked\r\nup." I looked after him. One of our well-known lady\'s doctors,\r\nnicknamed "The Duke." Not even he understood my real condition--a man I\r\nknew; whose hand I had shaken. I grew quiet. Locked up? Yes, I was mad;\r\nhe was right. I felt madness in my blood; felt its darting pain through\r\nmy brain. So that was to be the end of me! Yes, yes; and I resume my\r\nwearisome, painful walk. There was the haven in which I was to find\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I stop again. But not locked up! I say, not that; and I grew\r\nalmost hoarse with fear. I implored grace for myself; begged to the\r\nwind and weather not to be locked up. I should have to be brought to\r\nthe guard-house again, imprisoned in a dark cell which had not a spark\r\nof light in it. Not that! There must be other channels yet open that I\r\nhad not tried, and I would try them. I would be so earnestly\r\npainstaking; would take good time for it, and go indefatigably round\r\nfrom house to house. For example, there was Cisler the music-seller; I\r\nhadn\'t been to him at all. Some remedy would turn up!.... Thus I\r\nstumbled on, and talked until I brought myself to weep with emotion.\r\nCisler! Was that perchance a hint from on high? His name had struck me\r\nfor no reason, and he lived so far away; but I would look him up all\r\nthe same, go slowly, and rest between times. I knew the place well; I\r\nhad been there often, when times were good had bought much music from\r\nhim. Should I ask him for sixpence? Perhaps that might make him feel\r\nuncomfortable. I would ask him for a shilling. I went into the shop,\r\nand asked for the chief. They showed me into his office; there he\r\nsat--handsome, well-dressed in the latest style--running down some\r\naccounts. I stammered through an excuse, and set forth my errand.\r\nCompelled by need to apply to him ... it should not be very long till I\r\ncould pay it back ... when I got paid for my newspaper article.... He\r\nwould confer such a great benefit on me.... Even as I was speaking he\r\nturned about to his desk, and resumed his work. When I had finished, he\r\nglanced sideways at me, shook his handsome head, and said, "No"; simply\r\n"no"--no explanation--not another word.\r\n\r\nMy knees trembled fearfully, and I supported myself against the little\r\npolished barrier. I must try once more. Why should just his name have\r\noccurred to me as I stood far away from there in Vaterland? Something\r\nin my left side jerked a couple of times, and I broke out into a sweat.\r\nI said I was really awfully run down, and rather ill, worse luck. It\r\nwould certainly be no longer than a few days when I could repay it. If\r\nhe would be so kind?\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, why do you come to me?" he queried; "you are a\r\nperfect stranger off the street to me; go to the paper where you\r\nare known."\r\n\r\n"But only for this evening," said I; "the office is already shut\r\nup, and I am very hungry."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head persistently; kept on shaking it after I had\r\nseized the handle of the door. "Good-evening," I said. It was\r\nnot any hint from on high, thought I, and I smiled bitterly. If\r\nit came to that, I could give as good a hint as that myself.\r\nI dragged on one block after the other; now and then I rested\r\non a step. If only I could escape being locked up. The terror\r\nof that cell pursued me all the time; left me no peace. Whenever\r\nI caught sight of a policeman in my path I staggered into a side\r\nstreet to avoid meeting him. Now, then, we will count a hundred\r\nsteps, and try our luck again! There must be a remedy sometime....\r\n\r\nIt was a little yarn-shop--a place in which I had never before\r\nset foot; a solitary man behind the counter (there was an office\r\nbeyond, with a china plate on the door) was arranging things on\r\nthe shelves and counter. I waited till the last customer had left\r\nthe shop--a young lady with dimples. How happy she looked! I was\r\nnot backward in trying to make an impression with the pin holding\r\nmy coat together. I turned, and my chest heaved.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish for anything?" queried the shopman.\r\n\r\n"Is the chief in?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"He is gone for a mountain tour in Jotunhejmen," he replied. Was\r\nit anything very particular, eh?\r\n\r\n"It concerns a couple of pence for food," I said, and I tried to\r\nsmile. "I am hungry, and haven\'t a fraction."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re just about as rich as I am," he remarked, and began\r\nto tidy some packages of wool.\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t turn me away--not now!" I said on the moment, with a\r\ncold feeling over my whole body. "I am really nearly dead with\r\nhunger; it is now many days since I have eaten anything."\r\n\r\nWith perfect gravity, without saying a word, he began to turn his\r\npockets inside out, one by one. Would I not believe him, upon his\r\nword? What?\r\n\r\n"Only a halfpenny," said I, "and you shall have a penny back in a\r\ncouple of days."\r\n\r\n"My dear man, do you want me to steal out of the till?" he queried,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I. "Yes; take a halfpenny out of the till."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t be I that will do that," he observed; adding, "and let me\r\ntell you, at the same time, I\'ve had about enough of this."\r\n\r\nI tore myself out, sick with hunger, and boiling with shame. I had\r\nturned myself into a dog for the sake of a miserable bone, and I had\r\nnot got it. Nay, now there must be an end of this! It had really gone\r\nall too far with me. I had held myself up for many years, stood erect\r\nthrough so many hard hours, and now, all at once, I had sunk to the\r\nlowest form of begging. This one day had coarsened my whole mind,\r\nbespattered my soul with shamelessness. I had not been too abashed to\r\nstand and whine in the pettiest huckster\'s shop, and what had it\r\navailed me?\r\n\r\nBut was I not then without the veriest atom of bread to put inside my\r\nmouth? I had succeeded in rendering myself a thing loathsome to myself.\r\nYes, yes; but it must come to an end. Presently they would lock the\r\nouter door at home? I must hurry unless I wished to lie in the\r\nguard-house again.\r\n\r\nThis gave me strength. Lie in that cell again I would not. With body\r\nbent forward, and my hands pressed hard against my left ribs to deaden\r\nthe stings a little, I struggled on, keeping my eyes fastened upon the\r\npaving-stones that I might not be forced to bow to possible\r\nacquaintances, and hastened to the fire look-out. God be praised! it\r\nwas only seven o\'clock by the dial on Our Saviour\'s; I had three hours\r\nyet before the door would be locked. What a fright I had been in!\r\n\r\nWell, there was not a stone left unturned. I had done all I could. To\r\nthink that I really could not succeed once in a whole day! If I told it\r\nno one could believe it; if I were to write it down they would say I\r\nhad invented it. Not in a single place! Well, well, there is no help\r\nfor it. Before all, don\'t go and get pathetic again. Bah! how\r\ndisgusting! I can assure you, it makes me have a loathing for you. If\r\nall hope is over, why there is an end of it. Couldn\'t I, for that\r\nmatter, steal a handful of oats in the stable? A streak of light--a\r\nray--yet I knew the stable was shut.\r\n\r\nI took my ease, and crept home at a slow snail\'s pace. I felt thirsty,\r\nluckily for the first time through the whole day, and I went and sought\r\nabout for a place where I could get a drink. I was a long distance away\r\nfrom the bazaar, and I would not ask at a private house. Perhaps,\r\nthough, I could wait till I got home; it would take a quarter of an\r\nhour. It was not at all so certain that I could keep down a draught of\r\nwater, either; my stomach no longer suffered in any way--I even felt\r\nnausea at the spittle I swallowed. But the buttons! I had not tried the\r\nbuttons at all yet. There I stood, stock-still, and commenced to smile.\r\nMaybe there was a remedy, in spite of all! I wasn\'t totally doomed. I\r\nshould certainly get a penny for them; tomorrow I might raise another\r\nsome place or other, and Thursday I might be paid for my newspaper\r\narticle. I should just see it would come out all right. To think that I\r\ncould really go and forget the buttons. I took them out of my pocket,\r\nand inspected them as I walked on again. My eyes grew dazed with joy. I\r\ndid not see the street; I simply went on. Didn\'t I know exactly the big\r\npawn-shop--my refuge in the dark evenings, with my blood-sucking\r\nfriend? One by one my possessions had vanished there--my little things\r\nfrom home--my last book. I liked to go there on auction days, to look\r\non, and rejoice each time my books seemed likely to fall into good\r\nhands. Magelsen, the actor, had my watch; I was almost proud of that. A\r\ndiary, in which I had written my first small poetical attempt, had been\r\nbought by an acquaintance, and my topcoat had found a haven with a\r\nphotographer, to be used in the studio. So there was no cause to\r\ngrumble about any of them. I held my buttons ready in my hand; "Uncle"\r\nis sitting at his desk, writing. "I am not in a hurry," I say, afraid\r\nof disturbing him, and making him impatient at my application. My voice\r\nsounded so curiously hollow I hardly recognized it again, and my heart\r\nbeat like a sledge-hammer.\r\n\r\nHe came smilingly over to me, as was his wont, laid both his hands flat\r\non the counter, and looked at my face without saying anything. Yes, I\r\nhad brought something of which I would ask him if he could make any\r\nuse; something which is only in my way at home, assure you of it--are\r\nquite an annoyance--some buttons. Well, what then? what was there about\r\nthe buttons? and he thrusts his eyes down close to my hand. Couldn\'t he\r\ngive me a couple of halfpence for them?--whatever he thought\r\nhimself--quite according to his own judgment. "For the buttons?"--and\r\n"Uncle" stares astonishedly at me--"for these buttons?" Only for a\r\ncigar or whatever he liked himself; I was just passing, and thought I\r\nwould look in.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the old pawnbroker burst out laughing, and returned to his\r\ndesk without saying a word. There I stood; I had not hoped for much,\r\nyet, all the same, I had thought of a possibility of being helped. This\r\nlaughter was my death-warrant. It couldn\'t, I suppose, be of any use\r\ntrying with my eyeglasses either? Of course, I would let my glasses go\r\nin with them; that was a matter of course, said I, and I took them off.\r\nOnly a penny, or if he wished, a halfpenny.\r\n\r\n"You know quite well I can\'t lend you anything on your glasses," said\r\n"Uncle"; I told you that once before."\r\n\r\n"But I want a stamp," I said, dully. "I can\'t even send off the letters\r\nI have written; a penny or a halfpenny stamp, just as you will."\r\n\r\n"Oh, God help you, go your way!" he replied, and motioned me off with\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nYes, yes; well, it must be so, I said to myself. Mechanically, I put on\r\nmy glasses again, took the buttons in my hand, and, turning away, bade\r\nhim good-night, and closed the door after me as usual. Well, now, there\r\nwas nothing more to be done! To think he would not take them at any\r\nprice, I muttered. They are almost new buttons; I can\'t understand it.\r\n\r\nWhilst I stood, lost in thought, a man passed by and entered the\r\noffice. He had given me a little shove in his hurry. We both made\r\nexcuses, and I turned round and looked after him.\r\n\r\n"What! is that you?" he said, suddenly, when half-way up the steps. He\r\ncame back, and I recognized him. "God bless me, man, what on earth do\r\nyou look like? What were you doing in there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I had business. You are going in too, I see."\r\n\r\n"Yes; what were you in with?"\r\n\r\nMy knees trembled; I supported myself against the wall, and stretched\r\nout my hand with the buttons in it.\r\n\r\n"What the deuce!" he cried. "No; this is really going too far."\r\n\r\n"Good-night!" said I, and was about to go; I felt the tears choking my\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n"No; wait a minute," he said.\r\n\r\nWhat was I to wait for? Was he not himself on the road to my "Uncle,"\r\nbringing, perhaps, his engagement ring--had been hungry, perhaps, for\r\nseveral days--owed his landlady?\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied; "if you will be out soon...."\r\n\r\n"Of course," he broke in, seizing hold of my arm; "but I may as well\r\ntell you I don\'t believe you. You are such an idiot, that it\'s better\r\nyou come in along with me."\r\n\r\nI understood what he meant, suddenly felt a little spark of pride, and\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n"I can\'t; I promised to be in Bernt Akers Street at half-past seven,\r\nand...."\r\n\r\n"Half-past seven, quite so; but it\'s eight now. Here I am, standing\r\nwith the watch in my hand that I\'m going to pawn. So, in with you, you\r\nhungry sinner! I\'ll get you five shillings anyhow," and he pushed me in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III\r\n\r\n\r\nA week passed in glory and gladness.\r\n\r\nI had got over the worst this time, too. I had had food every day, and\r\nmy courage rose, and I thrust one iron after the other into the fire.\r\n\r\nI was working at three or four articles, that plundered my poor brain\r\nof every spark, every thought that rose in it; and yet I fancied that I\r\nwrote with more facility than before.\r\n\r\nThe last article with which I had raced about so much, and upon which I\r\nhad built such hopes, had already been returned to me by the editor;\r\nand, angry and wounded as I was, I had destroyed it immediately,\r\nwithout even re-reading it again. In future, I would try another paper\r\nin order to open up more fields for my work.\r\n\r\nSupposing that writing were to fail, and the worst were to come to the\r\nworst, I still had the ships to take to. The _Nun_ lay alongside the\r\nwharf, ready to sail, and I might, perhaps, work my way out to\r\nArchangel, or wherever else she might be bound; there was no lack of\r\nopenings on many sides. The last crisis had dealt rather roughly with\r\nme. My hair fell out in masses, and I was much troubled with headaches,\r\nparticularly in the morning, and my nervousness died a hard death. I\r\nsat and wrote during the day with my hands bound up in rags, simply\r\nbecause I could not endure the touch of my own breath upon them. If\r\nJens Olaj banged the stable door underneath me, or if a dog came into\r\nthe yard and commenced to bark, it thrilled through my very marrow like\r\nicy stabs piercing me from every side. I was pretty well played out.\r\n\r\nDay after day I strove at my work, begrudging myself the short time it\r\ntook to swallow my food before I sat down again to write. At this time\r\nboth the bed and the little rickety table were strewn over with notes\r\nand written pages, upon which I worked turn about, added any new ideas\r\nwhich might have occurred to me during the day, erased, or quickened\r\nhere and there the dull points by a word of colour--fagged and toiled\r\nat sentence after sentence, with the greatest of pains. One afternoon,\r\none of my articles being at length finished, I thrust it, contented and\r\nhappy, into my pocket, and betook myself to the "commandor." It was\r\nhigh time I made some arrangement towards getting a little money again;\r\nI had only a few pence left.\r\n\r\nThe "commandor" requested me to sit down for a moment; he would be\r\ndisengaged immediately, and he continued writing.\r\n\r\nI looked about the little office--busts, prints, cuttings, and an\r\nenormous paper-basket, that looked as if it might swallow a man, bones\r\nand all. I felt sad at heart at the sight of this monstrous chasm, this\r\ndragon\'s mouth, that always stood open, always ready to receive\r\nrejected work, newly crushed hopes.\r\n\r\n"What day of the month is it?" queried the "commandor" from the table.\r\n\r\n"The 28th," I reply, pleased that I can be of service to him, "the\r\n28th," and he continues writing. At last he encloses a couple of\r\nletters in their envelopes, tosses some papers into the basket, and\r\nlays down his pen. Then he swings round on his chair, and looks at me.\r\nObserving that I am still standing near the door, he makes a\r\nhalf-serious, half-playful motion with his hand, and points to a chair.\r\n\r\nI turn aside, so that he may not see that I have no waistcoat on, when\r\nI open my coat to take the manuscript out of my pocket.\r\n\r\n"It is only a little character sketch of Correggio," I say; "but\r\nperhaps it is, worse luck, not written in such a way that...."\r\n\r\nHe takes the papers out of my hand, and commences to go through them.\r\nHis face is turned towards me.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is thus he looks at close quarters, this man, whose name I\r\nhad already heard in my earliest youth, and whose paper had exercised\r\nthe greatest influence upon me as the years advanced? His hair is\r\ncurly, and his beautiful brown eyes are a little restless. He has a\r\nhabit of tweaking his nose now and then. No Scotch minister could look\r\nmilder than this truculent writer, whose pen always left bleeding scars\r\nwherever it attacked. A peculiar feeling of awe and admiration comes\r\nover me in the presence of this man. The tears are on the point of\r\ncoming to my eyes, and I advanced a step to tell him how heartily I\r\nappreciated him, for all he had taught me, and to beg him not to hurt\r\nme; I was only a poor bungling wretch, who had had a sorry enough time\r\nof it as it was....\r\n\r\nHe looked up, and placed my manuscript slowly together, whilst he sat\r\nand considered. To make it easier for him to give me a refusal, I\r\nstretch out my hand a little, and say:\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, of course, it is not of any use to you," and I smile to give\r\nhim the impression that I take it easily.\r\n\r\n"Everything has to be of such a popular nature to be of any use to us,"\r\nhe replies; "you know the kind of public we have. But can\'t you try and\r\nwrite something a little more commonplace, or hit upon something that\r\npeople understand better?"\r\n\r\nHis forbearance astonishes me. I understand that my article is\r\nrejected, and yet I could not have received a prettier refusal. Not to\r\ntake up his time any longer, I reply:\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I daresay I can."\r\n\r\nI go towards the door. Hem--he must pray forgive me for having taken up\r\nhis time with this ... I bow, and turn the door handle.\r\n\r\n"If you need it," he says, "you are welcome to draw a little in\r\nadvance; you can write for it, you know."\r\n\r\nNow, as he had just seen that I was not capable of writing, this offer\r\nhumiliated me somewhat, and I answered:\r\n\r\n"No, thanks; I can pull through yet a while, thanking you very much,\r\nall the same. Good-day!"\r\n\r\n"Good-day!" replies the "commandor," turning at the same time to his\r\ndesk again.\r\n\r\nHe had none the less treated me with undeserved kindness, and I was\r\ngrateful to him for it--and I would know how to appreciate it too. I\r\nmade a resolution not to return to him until I could take something\r\nwith me, that satisfied me perfectly; something that would astonish the\r\n"commandor" a bit, and make him order me to be paid half-a-sovereign\r\nwithout a moment\'s hesitation. I went home, and tackled my writing once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nDuring the following evenings, as soon as it got near eight o\'clock and\r\nthe gas was lit, the following thing happened regularly to me.\r\n\r\nAs I come out of my room to take a walk in the streets after the labour\r\nand troubles of the day, a lady, dressed in black, stands under the\r\nlamp-post exactly opposite my door.\r\n\r\nShe turns her face towards me and follows me with her eyes when I pass\r\nher by--I remark that she always has the same dress on, always the same\r\nthick veil that conceals her face and falls over her breast, and that\r\nshe carries in her hand a small umbrella with an ivory ring in the\r\nhandle. This was already the third evening I had seen her there, always\r\nin the same place. As soon as I have passed her by she turns slowly and\r\ngoes down the street away from me. My nervous brain vibrated with\r\ncuriosity, and I became at once possessed by the unreasonable feeling\r\nthat I was the object of her visit. At last I was almost on the point\r\nof addressing her, of asking her if she was looking for any one, if she\r\nneeded my assistance in any way, or if I might accompany her home.\r\nBadly dressed, as I unfortunately was, I might protect her through the\r\ndark streets; but I had an undefined fear that it perhaps might cost me\r\nsomething; a glass of wine, or a drive, and I had no money left at all.\r\nMy distressingly empty pockets acted in a far too depressing way upon\r\nme, and I had not even the courage to scrutinize her sharply as I\r\npassed her by. Hunger had once more taken up its abode in my breast,\r\nand I had not tasted food since yesterday evening. This, \'tis true, was\r\nnot a long period; I had often been able to hold out for a couple of\r\ndays at a time, but latterly I had commenced to fall off seriously; I\r\ncould not go hungry one quarter as well as I used to do. A single day\r\nmade me feel dazed, and I suffered from perpetual retching the moment I\r\ntasted water. Added to this was the fact that I lay and shivered all\r\nnight, lay fully dressed as I stood and walked in the daytime, lay blue\r\nwith cold, lay and froze every night with fits of icy shivering, and\r\ngrew stiff during my sleep. The old blanket could not keep out the\r\ndraughts, and I woke in the mornings with my nose stopped by the sharp\r\noutside frosty air which forced its way into the dilapidated room.\r\n\r\nI go down the street and think over what I am to do to keep myself\r\nalive until I get my next article finished. If I only had a candle I\r\nwould try to fag on through the night; it would only take a couple of\r\nhours if I once warmed to my work, and then tomorrow I could call on\r\nthe "commandor."\r\n\r\n\r\nI go without further ado into the Opland Cafe and look for my young\r\nacquaintance in the bank, in order to procure a penny for a candle. I\r\npassed unhindered through all the rooms; I passed a dozen tables at\r\nwhich men sat chatting, eating, and drinking; I passed into the back of\r\nthe cafe, ay, even into the red alcove, without succeeding in finding\r\nmy man.\r\n\r\nCrestfallen and annoyed I dragged myself out again into the street and\r\ntook the direction to the Palace.\r\n\r\nWasn\'t it now the very hottest eternal devil existing to think that my\r\nhardships never would come to an end! Taking long, furious strides,\r\nwith the collar of my coat hunched savagely up round my ears, and my\r\nhands thrust in my breeches pockets, I strode along, cursing my unlucky\r\nstars the whole way. Not one real untroubled hour in seven or eight\r\nmonths, not the common food necessary to hold body and soul together\r\nfor the space of one short week, before want stared me in the face\r\nagain. Here I had, into the bargain, gone and kept straight and\r\nhonourable all through my misery--Ha! ha! straight and honourable to\r\nthe heart\'s core. God preserve me, what a fool I had been! And I\r\ncommenced to tell myself how I had even gone about conscience-stricken\r\nbecause I had once brought Hans Pauli\'s blanket to the pawn-broker\'s. I\r\nlaughed sarcastically at my delicate rectitude, spat contemptuously in\r\nthe street, and could not find words half strong enough to mock myself\r\nfor my stupidity. Let it only happen now! Were I to find at this moment\r\na schoolgirl\'s savings or a poor widow\'s only penny, I would snatch it\r\nup and pocket it; steal it deliberately, and sleep the whole night\r\nthrough like a top. I had not suffered so unspeakably much for\r\nnothing--my patience was gone--I was prepared to do anything.\r\n\r\nI walked round the palace three, perhaps four, times, then came to the\r\nconclusion that I would go home, took yet one little turn in the park\r\nand went back down Carl Johann. It was now about eleven. The streets\r\nwere fairly dark, and the people roamed about in all directions, quiet\r\npairs and noisy groups mixed with one another. The great hour had\r\ncommenced, the pairing time when the mystic traffic is in full\r\nswing--and the hour of merry adventures sets in. Rustling petticoats,\r\none or two still short, sensual laughter, heaving bosoms, passionate,\r\npanting breaths, and far down near the Grand Hotel, a voice calling\r\n"Emma!" The whole street was a swamp, from which hot vapours exuded.\r\n\r\nI feel involuntarily in my pockets for a few shillings. The passion\r\nthat thrills through the movements of every one of the passers-by, the\r\ndim light of the gas lamps, the quiet pregnant night, all commence to\r\naffect me--this air, that is laden with whispers, embraces, trembling\r\nadmissions, concessions, half-uttered words and suppressed cries. A\r\nnumber of cats are declaring their love with loud yells in Blomquist\'s\r\ndoorway. And I did not possess even a florin! It was a misery, a\r\nwretchedness without parallel to be so impoverished. What humiliation,\r\ntoo; what disgrace! I began again to think about the poor widow\'s last\r\nmite, that I would have stolen a schoolboy\'s cap or handkerchief, or a\r\nbeggar\'s wallet, that I would have brought to a rag-dealer without more\r\nado, and caroused with the proceeds.\r\n\r\nIn order to console myself--to indemnify myself in some measure--I take\r\nto picking all possible faults in the people who glide by. I shrug my\r\nshoulders contemptuously, and look slightingly at them according as\r\nthey pass. These easily-pleased, confectionery-eating students, who\r\nfancy they are sowing their wild oats in truly Continental style if\r\nthey tickle a sempstress under the ribs! These young bucks, bank\r\nclerks, merchants, fl\xc3\xa2neurs--who would not disdain a sailor\'s wife;\r\nblowsy Molls, ready to fall down in the first doorway for a glass of\r\nbeer! What sirens! The place at their side still warm from the last\r\nnight\'s embrace of a watch-man or a stable-boy! The throne always\r\nvacant, always open to newcomers! Pray, mount!\r\n\r\nI spat out over the pavement, without troubling if it hit any one. I\r\nfelt enraged; filled with contempt for these people who scraped\r\nacquaintanceship with one another, and paired off right before my eyes.\r\nI lifted my head, and felt in myself the blessing of being able to keep\r\nmy own sty clean. At Stortingsplads (Parliament Place) I met a girl who\r\nlooked fixedly at me as I came close to her.\r\n\r\n"Good-night!" said I.\r\n\r\n"Good-night!" She stopped.\r\n\r\nHum! was she out walking so late? Did not a young lady run rather a\r\nrisk in being in Carl Johann at this time of night? Really not? Yes;\r\nbut was she never spoken to, molested, I meant; to speak plainly, asked\r\nto go along home with any one?\r\n\r\nShe stared at me with astonishment, scanned my face closely, to see\r\nwhat I really meant by this, then thrust her hand suddenly under my\r\narm, and said:\r\n\r\n"Yes, and we went too!"\r\n\r\nI walked on with her. But when we had gone a few paces past the\r\ncar-stand I came to a standstill, freed my arm, and said:\r\n\r\n"Listen, my dear, I don\'t own a farthing!" and with that I went on.\r\n\r\nAt first she would not believe me; but after she had searched all my\r\npockets, and found nothing, she got vexed, tossed her head, and called\r\nme a dry cod.\r\n\r\n"Good-night!" said I.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute," she called; "are those eyeglasses that you\'ve got\r\ngold?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then go to blazes with you!" and I went.\r\n\r\nA few seconds after she came running behind me, and called out to me:\r\n\r\n"You can come with me all the same!"\r\n\r\nI felt humiliated by this offer from an unfortunate street wench, and I\r\nsaid "No." Besides, it was growing late at night, and I was due at a\r\nplace. Neither could she afford to make sacrifices of that kind.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but now I will have you come with me."\r\n\r\n"But I won\'t go with you in this way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, naturally; you are going with some one else."\r\n\r\n"No," I answered.\r\n\r\nBut I was conscious that I stood in a sorry plight in face of this\r\nunique street jade, and I made up my mind to save appearances at least.\r\n\r\n"What is your name?" I inquired. "Mary, eh? Well, listen to me now,\r\nMary!" and I set about explaining my behaviour. The girl grew more and\r\nmore astonished in measure as I proceeded. Had she then believed that\r\nI, too, was one of those who went about the street at night and ran\r\nafter little girls? Did she really think so badly of me? Had I perhaps\r\nsaid anything rude to her from the beginning? Did one behave as I had\r\ndone when one was actuated by any bad motive? Briefly, in so many\r\nwords, I had accosted her, and accompanied her those few paces, to see\r\nhow far she would go on with it. For the rest, my name was\r\nSo-and-so--Pastor So-and-so. "Good-night; depart, and sin no more!"\r\nWith these words I left her.\r\n\r\nI rubbed my hands with delight over my happy notion, and soliloquized\r\naloud, "What a joy there is in going about doing good actions." Perhaps\r\nI had given this fallen creature an upward impulse for her whole life;\r\nsave her, once for all, from destruction, and she would appreciate it\r\nwhen she came to think over it; remember me yet in her hour of death\r\nwith thankful heart. Ah! in truth, it paid to be honourable, upright,\r\nand righteous!\r\n\r\nMy spirits were effervescing. I felt fresh and courageous enough to\r\nface anything that might turn up. If I only had a candle, I might\r\nperhaps complete my article. I walked on, jingling my new door-key in\r\nmy hand; hummed, and whistled, and speculated as to means of procuring\r\na candle. There was no other way out of it. I would have to take my\r\nwriting materials with me into the street, under a lamp-post. I opened\r\nthe door, and went up to get my papers. When I descended once more I\r\nlocked the door from the outside, and planted myself under the light.\r\nAll around was quiet; I heard the heavy clanking footstep of a\r\nconstable down in Taergade, and far away in the direction of St. Han\'s\r\nHill a dog barked. There was nothing to disturb me. I pulled my coat\r\ncollar up round my ears, and commenced to think with all my might.\r\n\r\nIt would be such an extraordinary help to me if I were lucky enough to\r\nfind a suitable winding up for this little essay. I had stuck just at a\r\nrather difficult point in it, where there ought to be a quite\r\nimperceptible transition to something fresh, then a subdued gliding\r\nfinale, a prolonged murmur, ending at last in a climax as bold and as\r\nstartling as a shot, or the sound of a mountain avalanche--full stop.\r\nBut the words would not come to me. I read over the whole piece from\r\nthe commencement; read every sentence aloud, and yet failed absolutely\r\nto crystallize my thoughts, in order to produce this scintillating\r\nclimax. And into the bargain, whilst I was standing labouring away at\r\nthis, the constable came and, planting himself a little distance away\r\nfrom me, spoilt my whole mood. Now, what concern was it of his if I\r\nstood and strove for a striking climax to an article for the\r\n_Commandor_? Lord, how utterly impossible it was for me to keep my head\r\nabove water, no matter how much I tried! I stayed there for the space\r\nof an hour. The constable went his way. The cold began to get too\r\nintense for me to keep still. Disheartened and despondent over this\r\nabortive effort, I opened the door again, and went up to my room.\r\n\r\nIt was cold up there, and I could barely see my window for the intense\r\ndarkness. I felt my towards the bed, pulled off my shoes, and set about\r\nwarming my feet between my hands. Then I lay down, as I had done for a\r\nlong time now, with all my clothes on.\r\n\r\nThe following morning I sat up in bed as soon as it got light, and set\r\nto work at the essay once more. I sat thus till noon; I had succeeded\r\nby then in getting ten, perhaps twenty lines down, and still I had not\r\nfound an ending.\r\n\r\nI rose, put on my shoes, and began to walk up and down the floor to try\r\nand warm myself. I looked out; there was rime on the window; it was\r\nsnowing. Down in the yard a thick layer of snow covered the\r\npaving-stones and the top of the pump. I bustled about the room, took\r\naimless turns to and fro, scratched the wall with my nail, leant my\r\nhead carefully against the door for a while, tapped with my forefinger\r\non the floor, and then listened attentively, all without any object,\r\nbut quietly and pensively as if it were some matter of importance in\r\nwhich I was engaged; and all the while I murmured aloud, time upon\r\ntime, so that I could hear my own voice.\r\n\r\nBut, great God, surely this is madness! and yet I kept on just as\r\nbefore. After a long time, perhaps a couple of hours, I pulled myself\r\nsharply together, bit my lips, and manned myself as well as I could.\r\nThere must be an end to this! I found a splinter to chew, and set\r\nmyself resolutely to again.\r\n\r\nA couple of short sentences formed themselves with much trouble, a\r\nscore of poor words which I tortured forth with might and main to try\r\nand advance a little. Then I stopped, my head was barren; I was\r\nincapable of more. And, as I could positively not go on, I set myself\r\nto gaze with wide open eyes at these last words, this unfinished sheet\r\nof paper; I stared at these strange, shaky letters that bristled up\r\nfrom the paper like small hairy creeping things, till at last I could\r\nneither make head nor tail of any of it. I thought on nothing.\r\n\r\nTime went; I heard the traffic in the street, the rattle of cars and\r\ntramp of hoofs. Jens Olaj\'s voice ascended towards me from the stables\r\nas he chid the horses. I was perfectly stunned. I sat and moistened my\r\nlips a little, but otherwise made no effort to do anything; my chest\r\nwas in a pitiful state. The dusk closed in; I sank more and more\r\ntogether, grew weary, and lay down on the bed again. In order to warm\r\nmy fingers a little I stroked them through my hair backwards and\r\nforwards and crosswise. Small loose tufts came away, flakes that got\r\nbetween my fingers, and scattered over the pillow. I did not think\r\nanything about it just then; it was as if it did not concern me. I had\r\nhair enough left, anyway. I tried afresh to shake myself out of this\r\nstrange daze that enveloped my whole being like a mist. I sat up,\r\nstruck my knees with my flat hands, laughed as hard as my sore chest\r\npermitted me--only to collapse again. Naught availed; I was dying\r\nhelplessly, with my eyes wide open--staring straight up at the roof. At\r\nlength I stuck my forefinger in my mouth, and took to sucking it.\r\nSomething stirred in my brain, a thought that bored its way in there--a\r\nstark-mad notion.\r\n\r\nSupposing I were to take a bite? And without a moment\'s reflection, I\r\nshut my eyes, and clenched my teeth on it.\r\n\r\nI sprang up. At last I was thoroughly awake. A little blood trickled\r\nfrom it, and I licked it as it came. It didn\'t hurt very much, neither\r\nwas the wound large, but I was brought at one bound to my senses. I\r\nshook my head, went to the window, where I found a rag, and wound it\r\nround the sore place. As I stood and busied myself with this, my eyes\r\nfilled with tears; I cried softly to myself. This poor thin finger\r\nlooked so utterly pitiable. God in Heaven! what a pass it had come to\r\nnow with me! The gloom grew closer. It was, maybe, not impossible that\r\nI might work up my finale through the course of the evening, if I only\r\nhad a candle. My head was clear once more. Thoughts came and went as\r\nusual, and I did not suffer particularly; I did not even feel hunger so\r\nbadly as some hours previously. I could hold out well till the next\r\nday. Perhaps I might be able to get a candle on credit, if I applied to\r\nthe provision shop and explained my situation--I was so well known in\r\nthere; in the good old days, when I had the means to do it, I used to\r\nbuy many a loaf there. There was no doubt I could raise a candle on the\r\nstrength of my honest name; and for the first time for ages I took to\r\nbrushing my clothes a little, got rid as well as the darkness allowed\r\nme of the loose hairs on my collar, and felt my way down the stairs.\r\n\r\nWhen I got outside in the street it occurred to me that I might perhaps\r\nrather ask for a loaf. I grew irresolute, and stopped to consider. "On\r\nno account," I replied to myself at last; I was unfortunately not in a\r\ncondition to bear food. It would only be a repetition of the same old\r\nstory--visions, and presentiments, and mad notions. My article would\r\nnever get finished, and it was a question of going to the "Commandor"\r\nbefore he had time to forget me. On no account whatever! and I decided\r\nupon the candle. With that I entered the shop.\r\n\r\nA woman is standing at the counter making purchases; several small\r\nparcels in different sorts of paper are lying in front of her. The\r\nshopman, who knows me, and knows what I usually buy, leaves the woman,\r\nand packs without much ado a loaf in a piece of paper and shoves it\r\nover to me.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, it was really a candle I wanted this evening," I say. I\r\nsay it very quietly and humbly, in order not to vex him and spoil my\r\nchance of getting what I want.\r\n\r\nMy answer confuses him; he turns quite cross at my unexpected words; it\r\nwas the first time I had ever demanded anything but a loaf from him.\r\n\r\n"Well then, you must wait a while," he says at last, and busies himself\r\nwith the woman\'s parcels again.\r\n\r\nShe receives her wares and pays for them---gives him a florin, out of\r\nwhich she gets the change, and goes out. Now the shop-boy and I are\r\nalone. He says:\r\n\r\n"So it was a candle you wanted, eh?" He tears open a package, and takes\r\none out for me. He looks at me, and I look at him; I can\'t get my\r\nrequest over my lips.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, that\'s true; you paid, though!" he says suddenly. He simply\r\nasserts that I had paid. I heard every word, and he begins to count\r\nsome silver out of the till, coin after coin, shining stout pieces. He\r\ngives me back change for a crown.\r\n\r\n"Much obliged," he says.\r\n\r\nNow I stand and look at these pieces of money for a second. I am\r\nconscious something is wrong somewhere. I do not reflect; do not think\r\nabout anything at all--I am simply struck of a heap by all this wealth\r\nwhich is lying glittering before my eyes--and I gather up the money\r\nmechanically.\r\n\r\nI stand outside the counter, stupid with amazement, dumb, paralyzed. I\r\ntake a stride towards the door, and stop again. I turn my eyes upon a\r\ncertain spot in the wall, where a little bell is suspended to a leather\r\ncollar, and underneath this a bundle of string, and I stand and stare\r\nat these things.\r\n\r\nThe shop-boy is struck by the idea that I want to have a chat as I take\r\nmy time so leisurely, and says, as he tidies a lot of wrapping-papers\r\nstrewn over the counter:\r\n\r\n"It looks as if we were going to have winter snow!"\r\n\r\n"Humph! Yes," I reply; "it looks as if we were going to have winter in\r\nearnest now; it looks like it," and a while after, I add: "Ah, well, it\r\nis none too soon."\r\n\r\nI could hear myself speak, but each word I uttered struck my ear as if\r\nit were coming from another person. I spoke absolutely unwittingly,\r\ninvoluntarily, without being conscious of myself.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do you think so?" says the boy.\r\n\r\nI thrust the hand with the money into my pocket, turned the\r\ndoor-handle, and left. I could hear that I said good-night, and that\r\nthe shop-boy replied to me.\r\n\r\nI had gone a few paces away from the shop when the shop-door was torn\r\nopen, and the boy called after me. I turned round without any\r\nastonishment, without a trace of fear; I only collected the money into\r\nmy hand, and prepared to give it back.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, you\'ve forgotten your candle," says the boy.\r\n\r\n"Ah, thanks," I answered quietly. "Thanks, thanks"; and I strolled on,\r\ndown the street, bearing it in my hand.\r\n\r\nMy first sensible thought referred to the money. I went over to a\r\nlamp-post, counted it, weighed it in my hand, and smiled. So, in spite\r\nof all, I was helped--extraordinarily, grandly, incredibly\r\nhelped--helped for a long, long time; and I thrust my hand with the\r\nmoney into my pocket, and walked on.\r\n\r\nOutside an eating-house in Grand Street I stopped, and turned over in\r\nmy mind, calmly and quietly, if I should venture so soon to take a\r\nlittle refreshment. I could hear the rattle of knives and plates\r\ninside, and the sound of meat being pounded. The temptation was too\r\nstrong for me--I entered.\r\n\r\n"A helping of beef," I say.\r\n\r\n"One beef!" calls the waitress down through the door to the lift.\r\n\r\nI sat down by myself at a little table next to the door, and prepared\r\nto wait. It was somewhat dark where I was sitting, and I felt tolerably\r\nwell concealed, and set myself to have a serious think. Every now and\r\nthen the waitress glanced over at me inquiringly. My first downright\r\ndishonesty was accomplished--my first theft. Compared to this, all my\r\nearlier escapades were as nothing--my first great fall.... Well and\r\ngood! There was no help for it. For that matter, it was open to me to\r\nsettle it with the shopkeeper later on, on a more opportune occasion.\r\nIt need not go any farther with me. Besides that, I had not taken upon\r\nmyself to live more honourably than all the other folk; there was no\r\ncontract that....\r\n\r\n"Do you think that beef will soon be here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; immediately"; the waitress opens the trapdoor, and looks down\r\ninto the kitchen.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the affair did crop up some day? If the shop-boy were to\r\nget suspicious and begin to think over the transaction about the bread,\r\nand the florin of which the woman got the change? It was not impossible\r\nthat he would discover it some day, perhaps the next time I went there.\r\nWell, then, Lord!... I shrugged my shoulders unobserved.\r\n\r\n"If you please," says the waitress, kindly placing the beef on the\r\ntable, "wouldn\'t you rather go to another compartment, it\'s so dark\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"No, thanks; just let me be here," I reply; her kindliness touches me\r\nat once. I pay for the beef on the spot, put whatever change remains\r\ninto her hand, close her fingers over it. She smiles, and I say in fun,\r\nwith the tears near my ears, "There, you\'re to have the balance to buy\r\nyourself a farm.... Ah, you\'re very welcome to it."\r\n\r\nI commenced to eat, got more and more greedy I as I did so, swallowed\r\nwhole pieces without chewing them, enjoyed myself in an animal-like way\r\nat every mouthful, and tore at the meat like a cannibal.\r\n\r\nThe waitress came over to me again.\r\n\r\n"Will you have anything to drink?" she asks, bending down a little\r\ntowards me. I looked at her. She spoke very low, almost shyly, and\r\ndropped her eyes. "I mean a glass of ale, or whatever you like best ...\r\nfrom me ... without ... that is, if you will...."\r\n\r\n"No; many thanks," I answer. "Not now; I shall come back another time."\r\n\r\nShe drew back, and sat down at the desk. I could only see her head.\r\nWhat a singular creature!\r\n\r\nWhen finished, I made at once for the door. I felt nausea already. The\r\nwaitress got up. I was afraid to go near the light--afraid to show\r\nmyself too plainly to the young girl, who never for a moment suspected\r\nthe depth of my misery; so I wished her a hasty good-night, bowed to\r\nher, and left.\r\n\r\nThe food commenced to take effect. I suffered much from it, and could\r\nnot keep it down for any length of time. I had to empty my mouth a\r\nlittle at every dark corner I came to. I struggled to master this\r\nnausea which threatened to hollow me out anew, clenched my hands, and\r\ntried to fight it down; stamped on the pavement, and gulped down\r\nfuriously whatever sought to come up. All in vain. I sprang at last\r\ninto a doorway, doubled up, head foremost, blinded with the water which\r\ngushed from my eyes, and vomited once more. I was seized with\r\nbitterness, and wept as I went along the street.... I cursed the cruel\r\npowers, whoever they might be, that persecuted me so, consigned them to\r\nhell\'s damnation and eternal torments for their petty persecution.\r\nThere was but little chivalry in fate, really little enough chivalry;\r\none was forced to admit that.\r\n\r\nI went over to a man staring into a shop-window, and asked him in great\r\nhaste what, according to his opinion, should one give a man who had\r\nbeen starving for a long time. It was a matter of life and death, I\r\nsaid; he couldn\'t even keep beef down.\r\n\r\n"I have heard say that milk is a good thing--hot milk," answered the\r\nman, astonished. "Who is it, by the way, you are asking for?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks, thanks," I say; "that idea of hot milk might not be half a bad\r\nnotion;" and I go.\r\n\r\nI entered the first caf\xc3\xa9 I came to going along, and asked for some\r\nboiled milk. I got the milk, drank it down, hot as it was, swallowed it\r\ngreedily, every drop, paid for it, and went out again. I took the road\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nNow something singular happened. Outside my door, leaning against the\r\nlamp-post, and right under the glare of it, stands a person of whom I\r\nget a glimpse from a long distance--it is the lady dressed in black\r\nagain. The same black-clad lady of the other evenings. There could be\r\nno mistake about it; she had turned up at the same spot for the fourth\r\ntime. She is standing perfectly motionless. I find this so peculiar\r\nthat I involuntarily slacken my pace. At this moment my thoughts are in\r\ngood working order, but I am much excited; my nerves are irritated by\r\nmy last meal. I pass her by as usual; am almost at the door and on the\r\npoint of entering. There I stop. All of a sudden an inspiration seizes\r\nme. Without rendering myself any account of it, I turn round and go\r\nstraight up to the lady, look her in the face, and bow.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening."\r\n\r\n"Good-evening," she answers.\r\n\r\nExcuse me, was she looking for anything? I had noticed her before;\r\ncould I be of assistance to her in any way? begged pardon, by-the-way,\r\nso earnestly for inquiring.\r\n\r\nYes; she didn\'t quite know....\r\n\r\nNo one lived inside that door besides three or four horses and myself;\r\nit was, for that matter, only a stable and a tinker\'s workshop.... She\r\nwas certainly on a wrong track if she was seeking any one there.\r\n\r\nAt this she turns her head away, and says: "I am not seeking for\r\nanybody. I am only standing here; it was really only a whim. I" ... she\r\nstops.\r\n\r\nIndeed, really, she only stood there, just stood there, evening after\r\nevening, just for a whim\'s sake!\r\n\r\nThat was a little odd. I stood and pondered over it, and it perplexed\r\nme more and more. I made up my mind to be daring; I jingled my money in\r\nmy pocket, and asked her, without further ado, to come and have a glass\r\nof wine some place or another ... in consideration that winter had\r\ncome, ha, ha! ... it needn\'t take very long ... but perhaps she would\r\nscarcely....\r\n\r\nAh, no, thanks; she couldn\'t well do that. No! she couldn\'t do that;\r\nbut would I be so kind as to accompany her a little way? She ... it was\r\nrather dark to go home now, and she was rather nervous about going up\r\nCarl Johann after it got so late.\r\n\r\nWe moved on; she walked at my right side. A strange, beautiful feeling\r\nempowered me; the certainty of being near a young girl. I looked at her\r\nthe whole way along. The scent of her hair; the warmth that irradiated\r\nfrom her body; the perfume of woman that accompanied her; the sweet\r\nbreath every time she turned her face towards me--everything penetrated\r\nin an ungovernable way through all my senses. So far, I just caught a\r\nglimpse of a full, rather pale, face behind the veil, and a high bosom\r\nthat curved out against her cape. The thought of all the hidden beauty\r\nwhich I surmised lay sheltered under the cloak and veil bewildered me,\r\nmaking me idiotically happy without any reasonable grounds. I could not\r\nendure it any longer; I touched her with my hand, passed my fingers\r\nover her shoulder, and smiled imbecilely.\r\n\r\n"How queer you are," said I.\r\n\r\n"Am I, really; in what way?"\r\n\r\nWell, in the first place, simply, she had a habit of standing outside a\r\nstable door, evening after evening, without any object whatever, just\r\nfor a whim\'s sake....\r\n\r\nOh, well, she might have her reason for doing so; besides, she liked\r\nstaying up late at night; it was a thing she had always had a great\r\nfancy for. Did I care about going to bed before twelve?\r\n\r\nI? If there was anything in the world I hated it was to go to bed\r\nbefore twelve o\'clock at night.\r\n\r\nAh, there, you see! She, too, was just the same; she took this little\r\ntour in the evenings when she had nothing to lose by doing so. She\r\nlived up in St. Olav\'s Place.\r\n\r\n"Ylajali," I cried.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon?"\r\n\r\n"I only said \'Ylajali\' ... it\'s all right. Continue...."\r\n\r\nShe lived up in St. Olav\'s Place, lonely enough, together with her\r\nmother, to whom one couldn\'t talk because she was so deaf. Was there\r\nanything odd in her liking to get out for a little?\r\n\r\n"No, not at all," I replied.\r\n\r\n"No? well, what then?"\r\n\r\nI could hear by her voice that she was smiling.\r\n\r\nHadn\'t she a sister?\r\n\r\nYes; an older sister. But, by-the-way, how did I know that? She had\r\ngone to Hamburg.\r\n\r\n"Lately?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; five weeks ago." From where did I learn that she had a sister?\r\n\r\nI didn\'t learn it at all; I only asked.\r\n\r\nWe kept silence. A man passes us, with a pair of shoes under his arm;\r\notherwise, the street is empty as far as we can see. Over at the Tivoli\r\na long row of coloured lamps are burning. It no longer snows; the sky\r\nis clear.\r\n\r\n"Gracious! don\'t you freeze without an overcoat?" inquires the lady,\r\nsuddenly looking at me.\r\n\r\nShould I tell her why I had no overcoat; make my sorry condition known\r\nat once, and frighten her away? As well first as last. Still, it was\r\ndelightful to walk here at her side and keep her in ignorance yet a\r\nwhile longer. So I lied. I answered:\r\n\r\n"No, not at all"; and, in order to change the subject, I asked, "Have\r\nyou seen the menagerie in the Tivoli?"\r\n\r\n"No," she answered; "is there really anything to see?"\r\n\r\nSuppose she were to take it into her head to wish to go there? Into\r\nthat blaze of light, with the crowd of people. Why, she would be filled\r\nwith shame; I would drive her out again, with my shabby clothes, and\r\nlean face; perhaps she might even notice that I had no waistcoat on....\r\n\r\n"Ah, no; there is sure to be nothing worth seeing!"\r\n\r\nAnd a lot of happy ideas occurred to me, of which I at once made use; a\r\nfew sparse words, fragments left in my dessicated brain. What would one\r\nexpect from such a small menagerie? On the whole, it did not interest\r\nme in the least to see animals in cases. These animals know that one is\r\nstanding staring at them; they feel hundreds of inquisitive looks upon\r\nthem; are conscious of them. No; I would prefer to see animals that\r\ndidn\'t know one observed them; shy creatures that nestle in their lair,\r\nand lie with sluggish green eyes, and lick their claws, and muse, eh?\r\n\r\nYes; I was certainly right in that.\r\n\r\nIt was only animals in all their peculiar fearfulness and peculiar\r\nsavagery that possessed a charm. The soundless, stealthy tread in the\r\ntotal darkness of night; the hidden monsters of the woods; the shrieks\r\nof a bird flying past; the wind, the smell of blood, the rumbling in\r\nspace; in short, the reigning spirit of the kingdom of savage creatures\r\nhovering over savagery ... the unconscious poetry!... But I was afraid\r\nthis bored her. The consciousness of my great poverty seized me anew,\r\nand crushed me. If I had only been in any way well-enough dressed to\r\nhave given her the pleasure of this little tour in the Tivoli! I could\r\nnot make out this creature, who could find pleasure in letting herself\r\nbe accompanied up the whole of Carl Johann Street by a half-naked\r\nbeggar. What, in the name of God, was she thinking of? And why was I\r\nwalking there, giving myself airs, and smiling idiotically at nothing?\r\nHad I any reasonable cause, either, for letting myself be worried into\r\na long walk by this dainty, silken-clad bird? Mayhap it did not cost me\r\nan effort? Did I not feel the ice of death go right into my heart at\r\neven the gentlest puff of wind that blew against us? Was not madness\r\nrunning riot in my brain, just for lack of food for many months at a\r\nstretch? Yet she hindered me from going home to get even a little milk\r\ninto my parched mouth; a spoonful of sweet milk, that I might perhaps\r\nbe able to keep down. Why didn\'t she turn her back on me, and let me go\r\nto the deuce?...\r\n\r\nI became distracted; my despair reduced me to the last extremity. I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Considering all things, you ought not to walk with me. I disgrace you\r\nright under every one\'s eyes, if only with my clothes. Yes, it is\r\npositively true; I mean it."\r\n\r\nShe starts, looks up quickly at me, and is silent; then she exclaims\r\nsuddenly:\r\n\r\n"Indeed, though!" More she doesn\'t say.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?" I queried.\r\n\r\n"Ugh, no; you make me feel ashamed.... We have not got very far now";\r\nand she walked on a little faster.\r\n\r\nWe turned up University Street, and could already see the lights in St.\r\nOlav\'s Place. Then she commenced to walk slowly again.\r\n\r\n"I have no wish to be indiscreet," I say; "but won\'t you tell me your\r\nname before we part? and won\'t you, just for one second, lift up your\r\nveil so that I can see you? I would be really so grateful."\r\n\r\nA pause. I walked on in expectation.\r\n\r\n"You have seen me before," she replies.\r\n\r\n"Ylajali," I say again.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon. You followed me once for half-a-day, almost right home.\r\nWere you tipsy that time?"\r\n\r\nI could hear again that she smiled.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I said. "Yes, worse luck, I was tipsy that time."\r\n\r\n"That was horrid of you!"\r\n\r\nAnd I admitted contritely that it was horrid of me.\r\n\r\nWe reached the fountains; we stop and look up at the many lighted\r\nwindows of No. 2.\r\n\r\n"Now, you mustn\'t come any farther with me," she says. "Thank you for\r\ncoming so far."\r\n\r\nI bowed; I daren\'t say anything; I took off my hat and stood\r\nbareheaded. I wonder if she will give me her hand.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you ask me to go back a little way with you?" she asks, in a\r\nlow voice, looking down at the toe of her shoe.\r\n\r\n"Great Heavens!" I reply, beside myself, "Great Heavens, if you only\r\nwould!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but only a little way."\r\n\r\nAnd we turned round.\r\n\r\nI was fearfully confused. I absolutely did not know if I were on my\r\nhead or my heels. This creature upset all my chain of reasoning; turned\r\nit topsy-turvy. I was bewitched and extraordinarily happy. It seemed to\r\nme as if I were being dragged enchantingly to destruction. She had\r\nexpressly willed to go back; it wasn\'t my notion, it was her own\r\ndesire. I walk on and look at her, and get more and more bold. She\r\nencourages me, draws me to her by each word she speaks. I forget for a\r\nmoment my poverty, my humble position, my whole miserable condition. I\r\nfeel my blood course madly through my whole body, as in the days before\r\nI caved in, and resolved to feel my way by a little ruse.\r\n\r\n"By-the-way, it wasn\'t you I followed that time," said I. "It was your\r\nsister."\r\n\r\n"Was it my sister?" she questions, in the highest degree amazed. She\r\nstands still, looks up at me, and positively waits for an answer. She\r\nputs the question in all sober earnest.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied. "Hum--m, that is to say, it was the younger of the\r\ntwo ladies who went on in front of me."\r\n\r\n"The youngest, eh? eh? a-a-ha!" she laughed out all at once, loudly,\r\nheartily, like a child. "Oh, how sly you are; you only said that just\r\nto get me to raise my veil, didn\'t you? Ah, I thought so; but you may\r\njust wait till you are blue first ... just for punishment."\r\n\r\nWe began to laugh and jest; we talked incessantly all the time. I do\r\nnot know what I said, I was so happy. She told me that she had seen me\r\nonce before, a long time ago, in the theatre. I had then comrades with\r\nme, and I behaved like a madman; I must certainly have been tipsy that\r\ntime too, more\'s the shame.\r\n\r\nWhy did she think that?\r\n\r\nOh, I had laughed so.\r\n\r\n"Really, a-ah yes; I used to laugh a lot in those days."\r\n\r\n"But now not any more?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; now too. It is a splendid thing to exist sometimes."\r\n\r\nWe reached Carl Johann. She said: "Now we won\'t go any farther," and we\r\nreturned through University Street. When we arrived at the fountain\r\nonce more I slackened my pace a little; I knew that I could not go any\r\nfarther with her.\r\n\r\n"Well, now you must turn back here," she said, and stopped.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose I must."\r\n\r\nBut a second after she thought I might as well go as far as the door\r\nwith her. Gracious me, there couldn\'t be anything wrong in that, could\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n"No," I replied.\r\n\r\nBut when we were standing at the door all my misery confronted me\r\nclearly. How was one to keep up one\'s courage when one was so broken\r\ndown? Here I stood before a young lady, dirty, ragged, torn, disfigured\r\nby hunger, unwashed, and only half-clad; it was enough to make one sink\r\ninto the earth. I shrank into myself, bent my head involuntarily, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"May I not meet you any more then?"\r\n\r\nI had no hope of being permitted to see her again. I almost wished for\r\na sharp No, that would pull me together a bit and render me callous.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she whispered softly, almost inaudibly.\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\nA pause....\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you be so kind as to lift your veil, only just for a minute," I\r\nasked. "So that I can see whom I have been talking to. Just for one\r\nmoment, for indeed I must see whom I have been talking to."\r\n\r\nAnother pause....\r\n\r\n"You can meet me outside here on Tuesday evening," she said. "Will you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear lady, if I have permission to."\r\n\r\n"At eight o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\nI stroked down her cloak with my hand, merely to have an excuse for\r\ntouching her. It was a delight to me to be so near her.\r\n\r\n"And you mustn\'t think all too badly of me," she added; she was smiling\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nSuddenly she made a resolute movement and drew her veil up over her\r\nforehead; we stood and gazed at one another for a second.\r\n\r\n"Ylajali!" I cried. She stretched herself up, flung her arms round my\r\nneck and kissed me right on the mouth--only once, swiftly,\r\nbewilderingly swiftly, right on the mouth. I could feel how her bosom\r\nheaved; she was breathing violently. She wrenched herself suddenly out\r\nof my clasp, called a good-night, breathlessly, whispering, and turned\r\nand ran up the stairs without a word more....\r\n\r\nThe hall door shut.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt snowed still more the next day, a heavy snow mingled with rain;\r\ngreat wet flakes that fell to earth and were turned to mud. The air was\r\nraw and icy. I woke somewhat late, with my head in a strange state of\r\nconfusion, my heart intoxicated from the foregone evening by the\r\nagitation of that delightful meeting. In my rapture (I had lain a while\r\nawake and fancied Ylajali at my side) I spread out my arms and embraced\r\nmyself and kissed the air. At length I dragged myself out of bed and\r\nprocured a fresh cup of milk, and straight on top of that a plate of\r\nbeef. I was no longer hungry, but my nerves were in a highly-strung\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nI went off to the clothes-shop in the bazaar. It occurred to me that I\r\nmight pick up a second-hand waistcoat cheaply, something to put on\r\nunder my coat; it didn\'t matter what.\r\n\r\nI went up the steps to the bazaar and took hold of one and began to\r\nexamine it.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus engaged an acquaintance came by; he nodded and called\r\nup to me. I let the waistcoat hang and went down to him. He was a\r\ndesigner, and was on the way to his office.\r\n\r\n"Come with me and have a glass of beer," he said. "But hurry up, I\r\nhaven\'t much time.... What lady was that you were walking with\r\nyesterday evening?"\r\n\r\n"Listen here now," said I, jealous of his bare thought. "Supposing it\r\nwas my _fianc\xc3\xa9e_."\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it was all settled yesterday evening."\r\n\r\nThis nonplussed him completely. He believed me implicitly. I lied in\r\nthe most accomplished manner to get rid of him. We ordered the beer,\r\ndrank it, and left.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-bye! O listen," he said suddenly. "I owe you a few\r\nshillings. It is a shame, too, that I haven\'t paid you long ago, but\r\nnow you shall have them during the next few days."\r\n\r\n"Yes, thanks," I replied; but I knew that he would never pay me back\r\nthe few shillings. The beer, I am sorry to say, went almost immediately\r\nto my head. The thought of the previous evening\'s adventure overwhelmed\r\nme--made me delirious. Supposing she were not to meet me on Tuesday!\r\nSupposing she were to begin to think things over, to get suspicious ...\r\nget suspicious of what?... My thoughts gave a jerk and dwelt upon the\r\nmoney. I grew afraid; deadly afraid of myself. The theft rushed in upon\r\nme in all its details. I saw the little shop, the counter, my lean\r\nhands as I seized the money, and I pictured to myself the line of\r\naction the police would adopt when they would come to arrest me. Irons\r\non my hands and feet; no, only on my hands; perhaps only on one hand.\r\nThe dock, the clerk taking down the evidence, the scratch of his\r\npen--perhaps he might take a new one for the occasion--his look, his\r\nthreatening look. There, Herr Tangen, to the cell, the eternally\r\ndark....\r\n\r\nHumph! I clenched my hands tightly to try and summon courage, walked\r\nfaster and faster, and came to the market-place. There I sat down.\r\n\r\nNow, no child\'s play. How in the wide world could any one prove that I\r\nhad stolen? Besides, the huckster\'s boy dare not give an alarm, even if\r\nit should occur to him some day how it had all happened. He valued his\r\nsituation far too dearly for that. No noise, no scenes, may I beg!\r\n\r\nBut all the same, this money weighed in my pocket sinfully, and gave me\r\nno peace. I began to question myself, and I became clearly convinced\r\nthat I had been happier before, during the period in which I had\r\nsuffered in all honour. And Ylajali? Had I, too, not polluted her with\r\nthe touch of my sinful hands? Lord, O Lord my God, Ylajali! I felt as\r\ndrunk as a bat, jumped up suddenly, and went straight over to the cake\r\nwoman who was sitting near the chemist\'s under the sign of the\r\nelephant. I might even yet lift myself above dishonour; it was far from\r\nbeing too late; I would show the whole world that I was capable of\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nOn the way over I got the money in readiness, held every farthing of it\r\nin my hand, bent down over the old woman\'s table as if I wanted\r\nsomething, clapped the money without further ado into her hands. I\r\nspoke not a word, turned on my heel, and went my way.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful savour there was in feeling oneself an honest man once\r\nmore! My empty pockets troubled me no longer; it was simply a\r\ndelightful feeling to me to be cleaned out. When I weighed the whole\r\nmatter thoroughly, this money had in reality cost me much secret\r\nanguish; I had really thought about it with dread and shuddering time\r\nupon time. I was no hardened soul; my honourable nature rebelled\r\nagainst such a low action. God be praised, I had raised myself in my\r\nown estimation again! "Do as I have done!" I said to myself, looking\r\nacross the thronged market-place--"only just do as I have done!" I had\r\ngladdened a poor old cake vendor to such good purpose that she was\r\nperfectly dumbfounded. Tonight her children wouldn\'t go hungry to\r\nbed.... I buoyed myself up with these reflections and considered that I\r\nhad behaved in a most exemplary manner. God be praised! The money was\r\nout of my hands now!\r\n\r\nTipsy and nervous, I wandered down the street, and swelled with\r\nsatisfaction. The joy of being able to meet Ylajali cleanly and\r\nhonourably, and of feeling I could look her in the face, ran away with\r\nme. I was not conscious of any pain. My head was clear and buoyant; it\r\nwas as if it were a head of mere light that rested and gleamed on my\r\nshoulders. I felt inclined to play the wildest pranks, to do something\r\nastounding, to set the whole town in a ferment. All up through\r\nGraendsen I conducted myself like a madman. There was a buzzing in my\r\nears, and intoxication ran riot in my brains. The whim seized me to go\r\nand tell my age to a commissionaire, who, by-the-way, had not addressed\r\na word to me; to take hold of his hands, and gaze impressively in his\r\nface, and leave him again without any explanation. I distinguished\r\nevery nuance in the voice and laughter of the passers-by, observed some\r\nlittle birds that hopped before me in the street, took to studying the\r\nexpression of the paving-stones, and discovered all sorts of tokens and\r\nsigns in them. Thus occupied, I arrive at length at Parliament Place. I\r\nstand all at once stock-still, and look at the droskes; the drivers are\r\nwandering about, chatting and laughing. The horses hang their heads and\r\ncower in the bitter weather. "Go ahead!" I say, giving myself a dig\r\nwith my elbow. I went hurriedly over to the first vehicle, and got in.\r\n"Ullevoldsveien, No. 37," I called out, and we rolled off.\r\n\r\nOn the way the driver looked round, stooped and peeped several times\r\ninto the trap, where I sat, sheltered underneath the hood. Had he, too,\r\ngrown suspicious? There was no doubt of it; my miserable attire had\r\nattracted his attention.\r\n\r\n"I want to meet a man," I called to him, in order to be beforehand with\r\nhim, and I explained gravely that I must really meet this man. We stop\r\noutside 37, and I jump out, spring up the stairs right to the third\r\nstorey, seize a bell, and pull it. It gives six or seven fearful peals\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nA maid comes out and opens the door. I notice that she has round, gold\r\ndrops in her ears, and black stuff buttons on her grey bodice. She\r\nlooks at me with a frightened air.\r\n\r\nI inquire for Kierulf--Joachim Kierulf, if I might add further--a\r\nwool-dealer; in short, not a man one could make a mistake about....\r\n\r\nThe girl shook her head. "No Kierulf lives here," said she.\r\n\r\nShe stared at me, and held the door ready to close it. She made no\r\neffort to find the man for me. She really looked as if she knew the\r\nperson I inquired for, if she would only take the trouble to reflect a\r\nbit. The lazy jade! I got vexed, turned my back on her, and ran\r\ndownstairs again.\r\n\r\n"He wasn\'t there," I called to the driver.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t he there?"\r\n\r\n"No. Drive to Tomtegaden, No. 11." I was in a state of the most violent\r\nexcitement, and imparted something of the same feeling to the driver.\r\nHe evidently thought it was a matter of life and death, and he drove\r\non, without further ado. He whipped up the horse sharply.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the man\'s name?" he inquired, turning round on the box.\r\n\r\n"Kierulf, a dealer in wool--Kierulf."\r\n\r\nAnd the driver, too, thought this was a man one would not be likely to\r\nmake any mistake about.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t he generally wear a light morning, coat?"\r\n\r\n"What!" I cried; "a light morning-coat? Are you mad? Do you think it is\r\na tea-cup I am inquiring about?" This light morning-coat came most\r\ninopportunely; it spoilt the whole man for me such as I had fancied him.\r\n\r\n"What was it you said he was called?--Kierulf?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," I replied. "Is there anything wonderful in that? The name\r\ndoesn\'t disgrace any one."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t he red hair?"\r\n\r\nWell, it was quite possible that he had red hair, and now that the\r\ndriver mentioned the matter, I was suddenly convinced that he was\r\nright. I felt grateful to the poor driver, and hastened to inform him\r\nthat he had hit the man off to a T--he really was just as he described\r\nhim,--and I remarked, in addition, that it would be a phenomenon to see\r\nsuch a man without red hair.\r\n\r\n"It must be him I drove a couple of times," said the driver; "he had a\r\nknobbed stick."\r\n\r\nThis brought the man vividly before me, and I said, "Ha, ha! I suppose\r\nno one has ever yet seen the man without a knobbed stick in his hand,\r\nof that you can be certain, quite certain."\r\n\r\nYes, it was clear that it was the same man he had driven. He recognized\r\nhim--and he drove so that the horse\'s shoes struck sparks as they\r\ntouched the stones.\r\n\r\nAll through this phase of excitement I had not for one second lost my\r\npresence of mind. We pass a policeman, and I notice his number is 69.\r\nThis number struck me with such vivid clearness that it penetrated like\r\na splint into my brain--69--accurately 69. I wouldn\'t forget it.\r\n\r\nI leant back in the vehicle, a prey to the wildest fancies; crouched\r\nunder the hood so that no one could see me. I moved my lips and\r\ncommenced to I talk idiotically to myself. Madness rages through my\r\nbrain, and I let it rage. I am fully conscious that I am succumbing to\r\ninfluences over which I have no control. I begin to laugh, silently,\r\npassionately, without a trace of cause, still merry and intoxicated\r\nfrom the couple of glasses of ale I have drunk. Little by little my\r\nexcitement abates, my calm returns more and more to me. I feel the cold\r\nin my sore finger, and I stick it down inside my collar to warm it a\r\nlittle. At length we reach Tomtegaden. The driver pulls up.\r\n\r\nI alight, without any haste, absently, listlessly, with my head heavy.\r\nI go through a gateway and come into a yard across which I pass. I come\r\nto a door which I open and pass through; I find myself in a lobby, a\r\nsort of anteroom, with two windows. There are two boxes in it, one on\r\ntop of the other, in one corner, and against the wall an old, painted\r\nsofa-bed over which a rug is spread. To the right, in the next room, I\r\nhear voices and the cry of a child, and above me, on the second floor,\r\nthe sound of an iron plate being hammered. All this I notice the moment\r\nas I enter.\r\n\r\nI step quietly across the room to the opposite door without any haste,\r\nwithout any thought of flight; open it, too, and come out in\r\nVognmansgaden. I look up at the house through which I have passed.\r\n"Refreshment and lodgings for travellers."\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to escape, to steal away from the driver who is\r\nwaiting for me. I go very coolly down Vognmansgaden, without fear of\r\nbeing conscious of doing any wrong. Kierulf, this dealer in wool, who\r\nhas spooked in my brain so long--this creature in whose existence I\r\nbelieve, and whom it was of vital importance that I should meet--had\r\nvanished from my memory; was wiped out with many other mad whims which\r\ncame and went in turns. I recalled him no longer, except as a\r\nreminiscence--a phantom.\r\n\r\nIn measure, as I walked on, I become more and more sober; felt languid\r\nand weary, and dragged my legs after me. The snow still fell in great\r\nmoist flakes. At last I reached Gronland; far out, near the church, I\r\nsat down to rest on a seat. All the passers-by looked at me with much\r\nastonishment. I fell a-thinking.\r\n\r\nThou good God, what a miserable plight I have come to! I was so\r\nheartily tired and weary of all my miserable life that I did not find\r\nit worth the trouble of fighting any longer to preserve it. Adversity\r\nhad gained the upper hand; it had been too strong for me. I had become\r\nso strangely poverty-stricken and broken, a mere shadow of what I once\r\nhad been; my shoulders were sunken right down on one side, and I had\r\ncontracted a habit of stooping forward fearfully as I walked, in order\r\nto spare my chest what little I could. I had examined my body a few\r\ndays ago, one noon up in my room, and I had stood and cried over it the\r\nwhole time. I had worn the same shirt for many weeks, and it was quite\r\nstiff with stale sweat, and had chafed my skin. A little blood and\r\nwater ran out of the sore place; it did not hurt much, but it was very\r\ntiresome to have this tender place in the middle of my stomach. I had\r\nno remedy for it, and it wouldn\'t heal of its own accord. I washed it,\r\ndried it carefully, and put on the same shirt. There was no help for\r\nit, it....\r\n\r\nI sit there on the bench and ponder over all this, and am sad enough. I\r\nloathe myself. My very hands seem distasteful to me; the loose, almost\r\ncoarse, expression of the backs of them pains me, disgusts me. I feel\r\nmyself rudely affected by the sight of my lean fingers. I hate the\r\nwhole of my gaunt, shrunken body, and shrink from bearing it, from\r\nfeeling it envelop me. Lord, if the whole thing would come to an end\r\nnow, I would heartily, gladly die!\r\n\r\nCompletely worsted, soiled, defiled, and debased in my own estimation,\r\nI rose mechanically and commenced to turn my steps homewards. On the\r\nway I passed a door, upon which the following was to be read on a\r\nplate--"Winding-sheets to be had at Miss Andersen\'s, door to the\r\nright." Old memories! I muttered, as my thoughts flew back to my former\r\nroom in Hammersborg. The little rocking-chair, the newspapers near the\r\ndoor, the lighthouse director\'s announcement, and Fabian Olsen, the\r\nbaker\'s new-baked bread. Ah yes; times were better with me then than\r\nnow; one night I had written a tale for ten shillings, now I couldn\'t\r\nwrite anything. My head grew light as soon as ever I attempted it. Yes,\r\nI would put an end to it now; and I went on and on.\r\n\r\nAs I got nearer and nearer to the provision shop, I had the\r\nhalf-conscious feeling of approaching a danger, but I determined to\r\nstick to my purpose; I would give myself up. I ran quickly up the\r\nsteps. At the door I met a little girl who was carrying a cup in her\r\nhands, and I slipped past her and opened the door. The shop boy and I\r\nstand face to face alone for the second time.\r\n\r\n"Well!" he exclaims; "fearfully bad weather now, isn\'t it?" What did\r\nthis going round the bush signify? Why didn\'t he seize me at once? I\r\ngot furious, and cried:\r\n\r\n"Oh, I haven\'t come to prate about the weather."\r\n\r\nThis violent preliminary takes him aback; his little huckster brain\r\nfails him. It has never even occurred to him that I have cheated him of\r\nfive shillings.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know, then, that I have swindled you?" I query impatiently,\r\nand I breathe quickly with the excitement; I tremble and am ready to\r\nuse force if he doesn\'t come to the point.\r\n\r\nBut the poor man has no misgivings.\r\n\r\nWell, bless my soul, what stupid creatures one has to mix with in this\r\nworld! I abuse him, explain to him every detail as to how it had all\r\nhappened, show him where the fact was accomplished, where the money had\r\nlain; how I had gathered it up in my hand and closed my fingers over\r\nit--and he takes it all in and does nothing. He shifts uneasily from\r\none foot to the other, listens for footsteps in the next room, make\r\nsigns to hush me, to try and make me speak lower, and says at last:\r\n\r\n"It was a mean enough thing of you to do!"\r\n\r\n"No; hold on," I explained in my desire to contradict him--to aggravate\r\nhim. It wasn\'t quite so mean as he imagined it to be, in his huckster\r\nhead. Naturally, I didn\'t keep the money; that could never have entered\r\nmy head. I, for my part, scorned to derive any benefit from it--that\r\nwas opposed to my thoroughly honest nature.\r\n\r\n"What did you do with it, then?"\r\n\r\n"I gave it away to a poor old woman--every farthing of it." He must\r\nunderstand that that was the sort of person I was; I didn\'t forget the\r\npoor so....\r\n\r\nHe stands and thinks over this a while, becomes manifestly very dubious\r\nas to how far I am an honest man or not. At last he says:\r\n\r\n"Oughtn\'t you rather to have brought it back again?"\r\n\r\n"Now, listen here," I reply; "I didn\'t want to get you into trouble in\r\nany way; but that is the thanks one gets for being generous. Here I\r\nstand and explain the whole thing to you, and you simply, instead of\r\nbeing ashamed as a dog, make no effort to settle the dispute with me.\r\nTherefore I wash my hands of you, and as for the rest, I say, \'The\r\ndevil take you!\' Good-day."\r\n\r\nI left, slamming the door behind me. But when I got home to my room,\r\ninto the melancholy hole, wet through from the soft snow, trembling in\r\nmy knees from the day\'s wanderings, I dismounted instantly from my high\r\nhorse, and sank together once more.\r\n\r\nI regretted my attack upon the poor shop-boy, wept, clutched myself by\r\nthe throat to punish myself for my miserable trick, and behaved like a\r\nlunatic. He had naturally been in the most deadly terror for the sake\r\nof his situation; he had not dared to make any fuss about the five\r\nshillings that were lost to the business, and I had taken advantage of\r\nhis fear, had tortured him with my violent address, stabbed him with\r\nevery loud word that I had roared out. And the master himself had\r\nperhaps been sitting inside the inner room, almost within an ace of\r\nfeeling called upon to come out and inquire what was the row. No, there\r\nwas no longer any limit to the low things I might be tempted to do.\r\n\r\nWell, why hadn\'t I been locked up? then it would have come to an end. I\r\nwould almost have stretched out my wrists for the handcuffs. I would\r\nnot have offered the slightest resistance; on the contrary, I would\r\nhave assisted them. Lord of Heaven and Earth! one day of my life for\r\none happy second again! My whole life for a mess of lentils! Hear me\r\nonly this once!...\r\n\r\nI lay down in the wet clothes I had on, with a vague idea that I might\r\ndie during the night. And I used my last strength to tidy up my bed a\r\nlittle, so that it might appear a little orderly about me in the\r\nmorning. I folded my hands and chose my position.\r\n\r\nAll at once I remember Ylajali. To think that I could have forgotten\r\nher the entire evening through! And light forces its way ever so\r\nfaintly into my spirit again--a little ray of sunshine that makes me so\r\nblessedly warm; and gradually more sun comes, a rare, silken, balmy\r\nlight that caresses me with soothing loveliness. And the sun grows\r\nstronger and stronger, burns sharply in my temples, seethes fiercely\r\nand glowingly in my emaciated brain. And at last, a maddening pyre of\r\nrays flames up before my eyes; a heaven and earth in conflagration men\r\nand beasts of fire, mountains of fire, devils of fire, an abyss, a\r\nwilderness, a hurricane, a universe in brazen ignition, a smoking,\r\nsmouldering day of doom!\r\n\r\nAnd I saw and heard no more....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI woke in a sweat the next morning, moist all over, my whole body\r\nbathed in dampness. The fever had laid violent hands on me. At first I\r\nhad no clear idea of what had happened to me; I looked about me in\r\namazement, felt a complete transformation of my being, absolutely\r\nfailed to recognize myself again. I felt along my own arms and down my\r\nlegs, was struck with astonishment that the window was where it was,\r\nand not in the opposite wall; and I could hear the tramp of the horses\'\r\nfeet in the yard below as if it came from above me. I felt rather sick,\r\ntoo--qualmish.\r\n\r\nMy hair clung wet and cold about my forehead. I raised myself on my\r\nelbow and looked at the pillow; damp hair lay on it, too, in patches.\r\nMy feet had swelled up in my shoes during the night, but they caused me\r\nno pain, only I could not move my toes much, they were too stiff.\r\n\r\nAs the afternoon closed in, and it had already begun to grow a little\r\ndusk, I got up out of bed and commenced to move about the room a\r\nlittle. I felt my way with short, careful steps, taking care to keep my\r\nbalance and spare my feet as much as possible. I did not suffer much,\r\nand I did not cry; neither was I, taking all into consideration, sad.\r\nOn the contrary, I was blissfully content. It did not strike me just\r\nthen that anything could be otherwise than it was.\r\n\r\nThen I went out.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that troubled me a little, in spite of the nausea that\r\nthe thought of food inspired in me, was hunger. I commenced to be\r\nsensible of a shameless appetite again; a ravenous lust of food, which\r\ngrew steadily worse and worse. It gnawed unmercifully in my breast;\r\ncarrying on a silent, mysterious work in there. It was as if a score of\r\ndiminutive gnome-like insects set their heads on one side and gnawed\r\nfor a little, then laid their heads on the other side and gnawed a\r\nlittle more, then lay quite still for a moment\'s space, and then began\r\nafresh, boring noiselessly in, and without any haste, and left empty\r\nspaces everywhere after them as they went on....\r\n\r\nI was not ill, but faint; I broke into a sweat. I thought of going to\r\nthe market-place to rest a while, but the way was long and wearisome;\r\nat last I had almost reached it. I stood at the corner of the market\r\nand Market Street; the sweat ran down into my eyes and blinded me, and\r\nI had just stopped in order to wipe it away a little. I did not notice\r\nthe place I was standing in; in fact, I did not think about it; the\r\nnoise around me was something frightful.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a call rings out, a cold, sharp warning. I hear this cry--hear\r\nit quite well, and I start nervously to one side, stepping as quickly\r\nas my bad foot allows me to. A monster of a bread-van brushes past me,\r\nand the wheel grazes my coat; I might perhaps have been a little\r\nquicker if I had exerted myself. Well, there was no help for it; one\r\nfoot pained me, a couple of toes were crunched. I felt that they, as it\r\nwere, curled up in my shoes.\r\n\r\nThe driver reins in his horse with all his might. He turns round on the\r\nvan and inquires in a fright how it fares with me. Oh! it might have\r\nbeen worse, far worse.... It was perhaps not so dangerous.... I didn\'t\r\nthink any bones were broken. Oh, pray....\r\n\r\nI rushed over as quickly as I could to a seat; all these people who\r\nstopped and stared at me abashed me. After all, it was no mortal blow;\r\ncomparatively speaking, I had got off luckily enough, as misfortune was\r\nbound to come in my way. The worst thing was that my shoe was crushed\r\nto pieces; the sole was torn loose at the toe. I help up my foot, and\r\nsaw blood inside the gap. Well, it wasn\'t intentional on either side;\r\nit was not the man\'s purpose to make things worse for me than they\r\nwere; he looked much concerned about it. It was quite certain that if I\r\nhad begged him for a piece of bread out of his cart he would have given\r\nit to me. He would certainly have given it to me gladly. God bless him\r\nin return, wherever he is!...\r\n\r\nI was terribly hungry, and I did not know what to do with myself and my\r\nshameless appetite. I writhed from side to side on the seat, and bowed\r\nmy chest right down to my knees; I was almost distracted. When it got\r\ndark I jogged along to the Town Hall--God knows how I got there--and\r\nsat on the edge of the balustrade. I tore a pocket out of my coat and\r\ntook to chewing it; not with any defined object, but with dour mien and\r\nunseeing eyes, staring straight into space. I could hear a group of\r\nlittle children playing around near me, and perceive, in an instinctive\r\nsort of way, some pedestrians pass me by; otherwise I observed nothing.\r\n\r\nAll at once, it enters my head to go to one of the meat bazaars\r\nunderneath me, and beg a piece of raw meat. I go straight along the\r\nbalustrade to the other side of the bazaar buildings, and descend the\r\nsteps. When I had nearly reached the stalls on the lower floor, I\r\ncalled up the archway leading to the stairs, and made a threatening\r\nbackward gesture, as if I were talking to a dog up there, and boldly\r\naddressed the first butcher I met.\r\n\r\n"Ah, will you be kind enough to give me a bone for my dog?" I said;\r\n"only a bone. There needn\'t be anything on it; it\'s just to give him\r\nsomething to carry in his mouth."\r\n\r\nI got the bone, a capital little bone, on which there still remained a\r\nmorsel of meat, and hid it under my coat. I thanked the man so heartily\r\nthat he looked at me in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no need of thanks," said he.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; don\'t say that," I mumbled; "it is kindly done of you," and I\r\nascended the steps again.\r\n\r\nMy heart was throbbing violently in my breast. I sneaked into one of\r\nthe passages, where the forges are, as far in as I could go, and\r\nstopped outside a dilapidated door leading to a back-yard. There was no\r\nlight to be seen anywhere, only blessed darkness all around me; and I\r\nbegan to gnaw at the bone.\r\n\r\nIt had no taste; a rank smell of blood oozed from it, and I was forced\r\nto vomit almost immediately. I tried anew. If I could only keep it\r\ndown, it would, in spite of all, have some effect. It was simply a\r\nmatter of forcing it to remain down there. But I vomited again. I grew\r\nwild, bit angrily into the meat, tore off a morsel, and gulped it down\r\nby sheer strength of will; and yet it was of no use. Just as soon as\r\nthe little fragments of meat became warm in my stomach up they came\r\nagain, worse luck. I clenched my hands in frenzy, burst into tears from\r\nsheer helplessness, and gnawed away as one possessed. I cried, so that\r\nthe bone got wet and dirty with my tears, vomited, cursed and groaned\r\nagain, cried as if my heart would break, and vomited anew. I consigned\r\nall the powers that be to the lowermost torture in the loudest voice.\r\n\r\nQuiet--not a soul about--no light, no noise; I am in a state of the\r\nmost fearful excitement; I breathe hardly and audibly, and I cry with\r\ngnashing teeth, each time that the morsel of meat, which might satisfy\r\nme a little, comes up. As I find that, in spite of all my efforts, it\r\navails me naught, I cast the bone at the door. I am filled with the\r\nmost impotent hate; shriek, and menace with my fists towards Heaven;\r\nyell God\'s name hoarsely, and bend my fingers like claws, with\r\nill-suppressed fury....\r\n\r\nI tell you, you Heaven\'s Holy Baal, you don\'t exist; but that, if you\r\ndid, I would curse you so that your Heaven would quiver with the fire\r\nof hell! I tell you, I have offered you my service, and you repulsed\r\nme; and I turn my back on you for all eternity, because you did not\r\nknow your time of visitation! I tell you that I am about to die, and\r\nyet I mock you! You Heaven God and Apis! with death staring me in the\r\nface--I tell you, I would rather be a bondsman in hell than a freedman\r\nin your mansions! I tell you, I am filled with a blissful contempt for\r\nyour divine paltriness; and I choose the abyss of destruction for a\r\nperpetual resort, where the devils Judas and Pharaoh are cast down!\r\n\r\nI tell you your Heaven is full of the kingdom of the earth\'s most\r\ncrass-headed idiots and poverty-stricken in spirit! I tell you, you\r\nhave filled your Heaven with the grossest and most cherished harlots\r\nfrom here below, who have bent their knees piteously before you at\r\ntheir hour of death! I tell you, you have used force against me, and\r\nyou know not, you omniscient nullity, that I never bend in opposition!\r\nI tell you, all my life, every cell in my body, every power of my soul,\r\ngasps to mock you--you Gracious Monster on High. I tell you, I would,\r\nif I could, breathe it into every human soul, every flower, every leaf,\r\nevery dewdrop in the garden! I tell you, I would scoff you on the day\r\nof doom, and curse the teeth out of my mouth for the sake of your\r\nDeity\'s boundless miserableness! I tell you from this hour I renounce\r\nall thy works and all thy pomps! I will execrate my thought if it dwell\r\non you again, and tear out my lips if they ever utter your name! I tell\r\nyou, if you exist, my last word in life or in death--I bid you\r\nfarewell, for all time and eternity--I bid you farewell with heart and\r\nreins. I bid you the last irrevocable farewell, and I am silent, and\r\nturn my back on you and go my way.... Quiet.\r\n\r\nI tremble with excitement and exhaustion, and stand on the same spot,\r\nstill whispering oaths and abusive epithets, hiccoughing after the\r\nviolent crying fit, broken down and apathetic after my frenzied\r\noutburst of rage. I stand there for maybe an hour, hiccough and\r\nwhisper, and hold on to the door. Then I hear voices--a conversation\r\nbetween two men who are coming down the passage. I slink away from the\r\ndoor, drag myself along the walls of the houses, and come out again\r\ninto the light streets. As I jog along Young\'s Hill my brain begins to\r\nwork in a most peculiar direction. It occurs to me that the wretched\r\nhovels down at the corner of the market-place, the stores for loose\r\nmaterials, the old booths for second-hand clothes, are really a\r\ndisgrace to the place--they spoilt the whole appearance of the market,\r\nand were a blot on the town, Fie! away with the rubbish! And I turned\r\nover in my mind as I walked on what it would cost to remove the\r\nGeographical Survey down there--that handsome building which had always\r\nattracted me so much each time I passed it. It would perhaps not be\r\npossible to undertake a removal of that kind under two or three hundred\r\npounds. A pretty sum--three hundred pounds! One must admit, a tidy\r\nenough little sum for pocket-money! Ha, ha! just to make a start with,\r\neh? and I nodded my head, and conceded that it was a tidy enough bit of\r\npocket-money to make a start with. I was still trembling over my whole\r\nbody, and hiccoughed now and then violently after my cry. I had a\r\nfeeling that there was not much life left in me--that I was really\r\nsinging my last verse. It was almost a matter of indifference to me; it\r\ndid not trouble me in the least. On the contrary, I wended my way down\r\ntown, down to the wharf, farther and farther away from my room. I\r\nwould, for that matter, have willingly laid myself down flat in the\r\nstreet to die. My sufferings were rendering me more and more callous.\r\nMy sore foot throbbed violently; I had a sensation as if the pain was\r\ncreeping up through my whole leg. But not even that caused me any\r\nparticular distress. I had endured worse sensations.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, I reached the railway wharf. There was no traffic, no\r\nnoise--only here and there a person to be seen, a labourer or sailor\r\nslinking round with their hands in their pockets. I took notice of a\r\nlame man, who looked sharply at me as we passed one another. I stopped\r\nhim instinctively, touched my hat, and inquired if he knew if the Nun\r\nhad sailed. Someway, I couldn\'t help snapping my fingers right under\r\nthe man\'s nose, and saying, "Ay, by Jove, the _Nun_; yes, the _Nun_!"\r\nwhich I had totally forgotten. All the same, the thought of her had\r\nbeen smouldering in me. I had carried it about unconsciously.\r\n\r\nYes, bless me, the Nun had sailed.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t tell me where she had sailed to?\r\n\r\nThe man reflects, stands on his long leg, keeps the other up in the\r\nair; it dangles a little.\r\n\r\n"No," he replies. "Do you know what cargo she was taking in here?"\r\n\r\n"No," I answer. But by this time I had already lost interest in the\r\n_Nun_, and I asked the man how far it might be to Holmestrand, reckoned\r\nin good old geographical miles.\r\n\r\n"To Holmestrand? I should think..."\r\n\r\n"Or to Voeblungsnaess?"\r\n\r\n"What was I going to say? I should think to Holmestrand..."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind; I have just remembered it," I interrupted him again.\r\n"You wouldn\'t perhaps be so kind as to give me a small bit of\r\ntobacco--only just a tiny scrap?"\r\n\r\nI received the tobacco, thanked the man heartily, and went on. I made\r\nno use of the tobacco; I put it into my pocket. He still kept his eye\r\non me--perhaps I had aroused his suspicions in some other way or\r\nanother. Whether I stood still or walked on, I felt his suspicious look\r\nfollowing me. I had no mind to be persecuted by this creature. I turn\r\nround, and, dragging myself back to him, say:\r\n\r\n"Binder"--only this one word, "Binder!" no more. I looked fixedly at\r\nhim as I say it, indeed I was conscious of staring fearfully at him. It\r\nwas as if I saw him with my entire body instead of only with my eyes. I\r\nstare for a while after I give utterance to this word, and then I jog\r\nalong again to the railway square. The man does not utter a syllable,\r\nhe only keeps his gaze fixed upon me.\r\n\r\n"Binder!" I stood suddenly still. Yes, wasn\'t that just what I had a\r\nfeeling of the moment I met the old chap; a feeling that I had met him\r\nbefore! One bright morning up in Graendsen, when I pawned my waistcoat.\r\nIt seemed to me an eternity since that day.\r\n\r\nWhilst I stand and ponder over this, I lean and support myself against\r\na house wall at the corner of the railway square and Harbour Street.\r\nSuddenly, I start quickly and make an effort to crawl away. As I do not\r\nsucceed in it, I stare case-hardened ahead of me and fling all shame to\r\nthe winds. There is no help for it. I am standing face to face with the\r\n"Commandor." I get devil-may-care--brazen. I take yet a step farther\r\nfrom the wall in order to make him notice me. I do not do it to awake\r\nhis compassion, but to mortify myself, place myself, as it were, on the\r\npillory. I could have flung myself down in the street and begged him to\r\nwalk over me, tread on my face. I don\'t even bid him good-evening.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the "Commandor" guesses that something is amiss with me. He\r\nslackens his pace a little, and I say, in order to stop him, "I would\r\nhave called upon you long ago with something, but nothing has come yet!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" he replies in an interrogative tone. "You haven\'t got it\r\nfinished, then?"\r\n\r\n"No, it didn\'t get finished."\r\n\r\nMy eyes by this time are filled with tears at his friendliness, and I\r\ncough with a bitter effort to regain my composure. The "Commandor"\r\ntweaks his nose and looks at me.\r\n\r\n"Have you anything to live on in the meantime?" he questions.\r\n\r\n"No," I reply. "I haven\'t that either; I haven\'t eaten anything today,\r\nbut...."\r\n\r\n"The Lord preserve you, man, it will never do for you to go and starve\r\nyourself to death," he exclaims, feeling in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThis causes a feeling of shame to awake in me, and I stagger over to\r\nthe wall and hold on to it. I see him finger in his purse, and he hands\r\nme half-a-sovereign.\r\n\r\nHe makes no fuss about it, simply gives me half-a-sovereign,\r\nreiterating at the same time that it would never do to let me starve to\r\ndeath. I stammered an objection and did not take it all at once. It is\r\nshameful of me to ... it was really too much....\r\n\r\n"Hurry up," he says, looking at his watch. "I have been waiting for the\r\ntrain; I hear it coming now."\r\n\r\nI took the money; I was dumb with joy, and never said a word; I didn\'t\r\neven thank him once.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t worth while feeling put out about it," said the "Commandor"\r\nat last. "I know you can write for it."\r\n\r\nAnd so off he went.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone a few steps, I remembered all at once that I had not\r\nthanked him for this great assistance. I tried to overtake him, but\r\ncould not get on quickly enough; my legs failed me, and I came near\r\ntumbling on my face. He went farther and farther away from me. I gave\r\nup the attempt; thought of calling after him, but dared not; and when\r\nafter all I did muster up courage enough and called once or twice, he\r\nwas already at too great a distance, and my voice had become too weak.\r\n\r\nI was left standing on the pavement, gazing after him. I wept quietly\r\nand silently. "I never saw the like!" I said to myself. "He gave me\r\nhalf-a-sovereign." I walked back and placed myself where he had stood,\r\nimitated all his movements held the half-sovereign up to my moistened\r\neyes, inspected it on both sides, and began to swear--to swear at the\r\ntop of my voice, that there was no manner of doubt that what I held in\r\nmy hand was half-a-sovereign. An hour after, maybe--a very long hour,\r\nfor it had grown very silent all around me--I stood, singularly enough,\r\noutside No. 11 Tomtegaden. After I had stood and collected my wits for\r\na moment and wondered thereat, I went through the door for the second\r\ntime, right into the "Entertainment and lodgings for travellers." Here\r\nI asked for shelter and was immediately supplied with a bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTuesday.\r\n\r\nSunshine and quiet--a strangely bright day. The snow had disappeared.\r\nThere was life and joy, and glad faces, smiles, and laughter\r\neverywhere. The fountains threw up sprays of water in jets,\r\ngolden-tinted from the sun-light, azure from the sky....\r\n\r\nAt noon I left my lodgings in Tomtegaden, where I still lived and found\r\nfairly comfortable, and set out for town. I was in the merriest humour,\r\nand lazied about the whole afternoon through the most frequented\r\nstreets and looked at the people. Even before seven o\'clock I took a\r\nturn up St. Olav\'s Place and took a furtive look up at the window of\r\nNo. 2. In an hour I would see her. I went about the whole time in a\r\nstate of tremulous, delicious dread. What would happen? What should I\r\nsay when she came down the stairs? Good-evening? or only smile? I\r\nconcluded to let it rest with the smile. Of course I would bow\r\nprofoundly to her.\r\n\r\nI stole away, a little ashamed to be there so early, wandered up Carl\r\nJohann for a while, and kept my eyes on University Street. When the\r\nclocks struck eight I walked once more towards St. Olav\'s Place. On the\r\nway it struck me that perhaps I might arrive a few minutes too late,\r\nand I quickened my pace as much as I could. My foot was very sore,\r\notherwise nothing ailed me.\r\n\r\nI took up my place at the fountain and drew breath. I stood there a\r\nlong while and gazed up at the window of No. 2, but she did not come.\r\nWell, I would wait; I was in no hurry. She might be delayed, and I\r\nwaited on. It couldn\'t well be that I had dreamt the whole thing! Had\r\nmy first meeting with her only existed in imagination the night I lay\r\nin delirium? I began in perplexity to think over it, and wasn\'t at all\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n"Hem!" came from behind me. I heard this, and I also heard light steps\r\nnear me, but I did not turn round, I only stared up at the wide\r\nstaircase before me.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening," came then. I forget to smile; I don\'t even take off my\r\nhat at first, I am so taken aback to see her come this way.\r\n\r\n"Have you been waiting long?" she asks. She is breathing a little\r\nquickly after her walk.\r\n\r\n"No, not at all; I only came a little while ago," I reply. "And\r\nbesides, would it matter if I had waited long? I expected, by-the-way,\r\nthat you would come from another direction."\r\n\r\n"I accompanied mamma to some people. Mamma is spending the evening with\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed," I say.\r\n\r\nWe had begun to walk on involuntarily. A policeman is standing at the\r\ncorner, looking at us.\r\n\r\n"But, after all, where are we going to?" she asks, and stops.\r\n\r\n"Wherever you wish; only where _you_ wish."\r\n\r\n"Ugh, yes! but it\'s such a bore to have to decide oneself."\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\nThen I say, merely for the sake of saying something:\r\n\r\n"I see it\'s dark up in your windows."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is," she replies gaily; "the servant has an evening off, too,\r\nso I am all alone at home."\r\n\r\nWe both stand and look up at the windows of No. 2 as if neither of us\r\nhad seen them before.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t we go up to your place, then?" I say; "I shall sit down at the\r\ndoor the whole time if you like."\r\n\r\nBut then I trembled with emotion, and regretted greatly that I had\r\nperhaps been too forward. Supposing she were to get angry, and leave\r\nme. Suppose I were never to see her again. Ah, that miserable attire of\r\nmine! I waited despairingly for her reply.\r\n\r\n"You shall certainly not sit down by the door," she says. She says it\r\nright down tenderly, and says accurately these words: "You shall\r\ncertainly not sit down by the door."\r\n\r\nWe went up.\r\n\r\nOut on the lobby, where it was dark, she took hold of my hand, and led\r\nme on. There was no necessity for my being so quiet, she said, I could\r\nvery well talk. We entered. Whilst she lit the candle--it was not a\r\nlamp she lit, but a candle--whilst she lit the candle, she said, with a\r\nlittle laugh:\r\n\r\n"But now you mustn\'t look at me. Ugh! I am so ashamed, but I will never\r\ndo it again."\r\n\r\n"What will you never do again?"\r\n\r\n"I will never ... ugh ... no ... good gracious ... I will never kiss\r\nyou again!"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you?" I said, and we both laughed. I stretched out my arms to\r\nher, and she glided away; slipped round to the other side of the table.\r\nWe stood a while and gazed at one another; the candle stood right\r\nbetween us.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Try and catch me," she said; and with much laughter I tried to seize\r\nhold of her. Whilst she sprang about, she loosened her veil, and took\r\noff her hat; her sparkling eyes hung on mine, and watched my movements.\r\nI made a fresh sortie, and tripped on the carpet and fell, my sore foot\r\nrefusing to bear me up any longer. I rose in extreme confusion.\r\n\r\n"Lord, how red you did get!" she said. "Well it was awfully awkward of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was," I agreed, and we began the chase afresh.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me you limp."\r\n\r\n"Yes; perhaps I do--just a little--only just a little, for that matter."\r\n\r\n"Last time you had a sore finger, now you have got a sore foot; it is\r\nawful the number of afflictions you have."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. I was run over slightly, a few days ago."\r\n\r\n"Run over! Tipsy again? Why, good heavens! what a life you lead, young\r\nman!" and she threatened me with her forefinger, and tried to appear\r\ngrave. "Well, let us sit down, then; no, not down there by the door;\r\nyou are far too reserved! Come here--you there, and I here--so, that\'s\r\nit ... ugh, it\'s such a bore with reticent people! One has to say and\r\ndo everything oneself; one gets no help to do anything. Now, for\r\nexample, you might just as well put your arm over the back of my chair;\r\nyou could easily have thought of that much out of your own head,\r\ncouldn\'t you? But if I say anything like that, you open your eyes as\r\nwide as if you couldn\'t believe what was being said. Yes, it is really\r\ntrue; I have noticed it several times; you are doing it now, too; but\r\nyou needn\'t try to persuade me that you are always so modest; it is\r\nonly when you don\'t dare to be otherwise than quiet. You were daring\r\nenough the day you were tipsy--when you followed me straight home and\r\nworried me with your witticisms. \'You are losing your book, madam; you\r\nare quite certainly losing your book, madam!\' Ha, ha, ha! it was really\r\nshameless of you."\r\n\r\nI sat dejectedly and looked at her; my heart beat violently, my blood\r\nraced quickly through my veins, there was a singular sense of enjoyment\r\nin it!\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you say something?"\r\n\r\n"What a darling you are," I cried. "I am simply sitting here getting\r\nthoroughly fascinated by you--here this very moment thoroughly\r\nfascinated.... There is no help for it.... You are the most\r\nextraordinary creature that ... sometimes your eyes gleam so, that I\r\nnever saw their match; they look like flowers ... eh? No, well, no,\r\nperhaps, not like flowers, either, but ... I am so desperately in love\r\nwith you, and it is so preposterous ... for, great Scott! there is\r\nnaturally not an atom of a chance for me.... What is your name? Now,\r\nyou really must tell me what you are called."\r\n\r\n"No; what is _your_ name? Gracious, I was nearly forgetting that again!\r\nI thought about it all yesterday, that I meant to ask you--yes, that is\r\nto say, not _all_ yesterday, but--"\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I named you? I named you Ylajali. How do you like\r\nthat? It has a gliding sound...."\r\n\r\n"Ylajali?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Is that a foreign language?"\r\n\r\n"Humph--no, it isn\'t that either!"\r\n\r\n"Well, it isn\'t ugly!"\r\n\r\nAfter a long discussion we told one another our names. She seated\r\nherself close to my side on the sofa, and shoved the chair away with\r\nher foot, and we began to chatter afresh.\r\n\r\n"You are shaved this evening, too," she said; look on the whole a\r\nlittle better than the last time--that is to say, only just a scrap\r\nbetter. Don\'t imagine ... no; the last time you were really shabby, and\r\nyou had a dirty rag round your finger into the bargain; and in that\r\nstate you absolutely wanted me to go to some place, and take wine with\r\nyou--thanks, not me!"\r\n\r\n"So it was, after all, because of my miserable appearance that you\r\nwould not go with me?" I said.\r\n\r\n"No," she replied and looked down. "No; God knows it wasn\'t. I didn\'t\r\neven think about it."\r\n\r\n"Listen," said I; "you are evidently sitting here labouring under the\r\ndelusion that I can dress and live exactly as I choose, aren\'t you? And\r\nthat is just what I can\'t do; I am very, very poor."\r\n\r\nShe looked at me. "Are you?" she queried.\r\n\r\n"Yes, worse luck, I am."\r\n\r\nAfter an interval.\r\n\r\n"Well, gracious, so am I, too," she said, with a cheerful movement of\r\nher head.\r\n\r\nEvery one of her words intoxicated me, fell on my heart like drops of\r\nwine. She enchanted me with the trick she had of putting her head a\r\nlittle on one side, and listening when I said anything, and I could\r\nfeel her breath brush my face.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," I said, "that ... but, now, you mustn\'t get angry--when\r\nI went to bed last night I settled this arm for you ... so ... as if\r\nyou lay on it ... and then I went to sleep."\r\n\r\n"Did you? That was lovely!" A pause. "But of course it could only be\r\nfrom a distance that you would venture to do such a thing, for\r\notherwise...."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you believe I could do it otherwise?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t believe it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, from me you may expect everything," I said, and I put my arm\r\naround her waist.\r\n\r\n"Can I?" was all she said.\r\n\r\nIt annoyed me, almost wounded me, that she should look upon me as being\r\nso utterly inoffensive. I braced myself up, steeled my heart, and\r\nseized her hand; but she withdrew it softly, and moved a little away\r\nfrom me. That just put an end to my courage again; I felt ashamed, and\r\nlooked out through the window. I was, in spite of all, in far too\r\nwretched a condition; I must, above all, not try to imagine myself any\r\none in particular. It would have been another matter if I had met her\r\nduring the time that I still looked like a respectable human being--in\r\nmy old, well-off days when I had sufficient to make an appearance; and\r\nI felt fearfully downcast!\r\n\r\n"There now, one can see!" she said, "now one can just see one can snub\r\nyou with just the tiniest frown--make you look sheepish by just moving\r\na little away from you" ... she laughed, tantalizingly, roguishly, with\r\ntightly-closed eyes, as if she could not stand being looked at, either.\r\n\r\n"Well, upon my soul!" I blurted out, "now you shall just see," and I\r\nflung my arms violently around her shoulders. I was mortified. Was the\r\ngirl out of her senses? Did she think I was totally inexperienced! Ha!\r\nThen I would, by the living.... No one should say of me that I was\r\nbackward on that score. The creature was possessed by the devil\r\nhimself! If it were only a matter of going at it, well....\r\n\r\nShe sat quite quietly, and still kept her eyes closed; neither of us\r\nspoke. I crushed her fiercely to me, pressed her body greedily against\r\nmy breast, and she spoke never a word. I heard her heart\'s beat, both\r\nhers and mine; they sounded like hurrying hoofbeats.\r\n\r\nI kissed her.\r\n\r\nI no longer knew myself. I uttered some nonsense, that she laughed at,\r\nwhispered pet names into her mouth, caressed her cheek, kissed her many\r\ntimes....\r\n\r\nShe winds her arms about my neck, quite slowly, tenderly, the breath of\r\nher pink quivering nostrils fans me right in the face; she strokes down\r\nmy shoulders with her left hand, and says, "What a lot of loose hair\r\nthere is."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I reply.\r\n\r\n"What can be the reason that your hair falls out so?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Ah, of course, because you drink too much, and perhaps ... fie, I\r\nwon\'t say it. You ought to be ashamed. No, I wouldn\'t have believed\r\nthat of you! To think that you, who are so young, already should lose\r\nyour hair! Now, do please just tell me what sort of way you really\r\nspend your life--I am certain it is dreadful! But only the truth, do\r\nyou hear; no evasions. Anyway, I shall see by you if you hide\r\nanything--there, tell now!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but let me kiss you first, then."\r\n\r\n"Are you mad?... Humph, ... I want to hear what kind of a man you\r\nare.... Ah, I am sure it is dreadful."\r\n\r\nIt hurt me that she should believe the worst of me; I was afraid of\r\nthrusting her away entirely, and I could not endure the misgivings she\r\nhad as to my way of life. I would clear myself in her eyes, make myself\r\nworthy of her, show her that she was sitting at the side of a person\r\nalmost angelically disposed. Why, bless me, I could count my falls up\r\nto date on my fingers. I related--related all--and I only related\r\ntruth. I made out nothing any worse than it was; it was not my\r\nintention to rouse her compassion. I told her also that I had stolen\r\nfive shillings one evening.\r\n\r\nShe sat and listened, with open mouth, pale, frightened, her shining\r\neyes completely bewildered. I desired to make it good again, to\r\ndisperse the sad impression I had made, and I pulled myself up.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is all over now!" I said; "there can be no talk of such a\r\nthing happening again; I am saved now...."\r\n\r\nBut she was much dispirited. "The Lord preserve me!" was all she said,\r\nthen kept silent. She repeated this at short intervals, and kept silent\r\nafter each "the Lord preserve me."\r\n\r\nI began to jest, caught hold of her, tried to tickle her, lifted her up\r\nto my breast. I was irritated not a little--indeed, downright hurt. Was\r\nI more unworthy in her eyes now, than if I had myself been instrumental\r\nin causing the falling out of my hair? Would she have thought more of\r\nme if I had made myself out to be a _rou\xc3\xa9_?... No nonsense now;... it\r\nwas just a matter of going at it; and if it was only just a matter of\r\ngoing at it, so, by the living...\r\n\r\n"No;... what do you want?" she queried, and she added these distressing\r\nwords, "I can\'t be sure that you are not insane!"\r\n\r\nI checked myself involuntarily, and I said: "You don\'t mean that!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, God knows I do! you look so strangely. And the forenoon you\r\nfollowed me--after all, you weren\'t tipsy that time?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I wasn\'t hungry then, either; I had just eaten...."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but that made it so much the worse."\r\n\r\n"Would you rather I had been tipsy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes ... ugh ... I am afraid of you! Lord, can\'t you let me be now!"\r\n\r\nI considered a moment. No, I couldn\'t let her be.... I happened, as if\r\ninadvertently, to knock over the light, so that it went out. She made a\r\ndespairing struggle--gave vent at last to a little whimper.\r\n\r\n"No, not that! If you like, you may rather kiss me, oh, dear, kind...."\r\n\r\nI stopped instantly. Her words sounded so terrified, so helpless, I was\r\nstruck to the heart. She meant to offer me a compensation by giving me\r\nleave to kiss her! How charming, how charmingly na\xc3\xafve. I could have\r\nfallen down and knelt before her.\r\n\r\n"But, dear pretty one," I said, completely bewildered, "I don\'t\r\nunderstand.... I really can\'t conceive what sort of a game this is...."\r\n\r\nShe rose, lit the candle again with trembling hands. I leant back on\r\nthe sofa and did nothing. What would happen now? I was in reality very\r\nill at ease.\r\n\r\nShe cast a look over at the clock on the wall, and started.\r\n\r\n"Ugh, the girl will soon come now!" she said; this was the first thing\r\nshe said. I took the hint, and rose. She took up her jacket as if to\r\nput it on, bethought herself, and let it lie, and went over to the\r\nfireplace. So that it should not appear as if she had shown me the\r\ndoor, I said:\r\n\r\n"Was your father in the army?" and at the same time I prepared to leave.\r\n\r\n"Yes; he was an officer. How did you know?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know; it just came into my head."\r\n\r\n"That was odd."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; there were some places I came to where I got a kind of\r\npresentiment. Ha, ha!--a part of my insanity, eh?"\r\n\r\nShe looked quickly up, but didn\'t answer. I felt I worried her with my\r\npresence, and determined to make short work of it. I went towards the\r\ndoor. Would she not kiss me any more now? not even give me her hand? I\r\nstood and waited.\r\n\r\n"Are you going now, then?" she said, and yet she remained quietly\r\nstanding over near the fireplace.\r\n\r\nI did not reply. I stood humbly in confusion, and looked at her without\r\nsaying anything. Why hadn\'t she left me in peace, when nothing was to\r\ncome of it? What was the matter with her now? It didn\'t seem to put her\r\nout that I stood prepared to leave. She was all at once completely lost\r\nto me, and I searched for something to say to her in farewell--a\r\nweighty, cutting word that would strike her, and perhaps impress her a\r\nlittle. And in the face of my first resolve, hurt as I was, instead of\r\nbeing proud and cold, disturbed and offended, I began right off to talk\r\nof trifles. The telling word would not come; I conducted myself in an\r\nexceedingly aimless fashion. Why couldn\'t she just as well tell me\r\nplainly and straightly to go my way? I queried. Yes, indeed, why not?\r\nThere was no need of feeling embarrassed about it. Instead of reminding\r\nme that the girl would soon come home, she could have simply said as\r\nfollows: "Now you must run, for I must go and fetch my mother, and I\r\nwon\'t have your escort through the street." So it was not that she had\r\nbeen thinking about? Ah, yes; it was that all the same she had thought\r\nabout; I understood that at once. It did not require much to put me on\r\nthe right track; only, just the way she had taken up her jacket, and\r\nleft it down again, had convinced me immediately. As I said before, I\r\nhad presentiments; and it was not altogether insanity that was at the\r\nroot of it....\r\n\r\n"But, great heavens! do forgive me for that word! It slipped out of my\r\nmouth," she cried; but yet she stood quite quietly, and did not come\r\nover to me.\r\n\r\nI was inflexible, and went on. I stood there and prattled, with the\r\npainful consciousness that I bored her, that not one of my words went\r\nhome, and all the same I did not cease.\r\n\r\nAt bottom one might be a fairly sensitive nature, even if one were not\r\ninsane, I ventured to say. There were natures that fed on trifles, and\r\ndied just for one hard word\'s sake; and I implied that I had such a\r\nnature. The fact was, that my poverty had in that degree sharpened\r\ncertain powers in me, so that they caused me unpleasantness. Yes, I\r\nassure you honestly, unpleasantness; worse luck! But this had also its\r\nadvantages. It helped me in certain situations in life. The poor\r\nintelligent man is a far nicer observer than the rich intelligent man.\r\nThe poor man looks about him at every step he takes, listens\r\nsuspiciously to every word he hears from the people he meets, every\r\nstep he takes affords in this way a task for his thoughts and\r\nfeelings--an occupation. He is quick of hearing, and sensitive; he is\r\nan experienced man, his soul bears the sears of the fire....\r\n\r\nAnd I talked a long time over these sears my soul had. But the longer I\r\ntalked, the more troubled she grew. At last she muttered, "My God!" a\r\ncouple of times in despair, and wrung her hands. I could see well that\r\nI tormented her, and I had no wish to torment her--but did it, all the\r\nsame. At last, being of the opinion that I had succeeded in telling her\r\nin rude enough terms the essentials of what I had to say, I was touched\r\nby her heart-stricken expression. I cried:\r\n\r\n"Now I am going, now I am going. Can\'t you see that I already have my\r\nhand on the handle of the door? Good-bye, good-bye," I say. "You might\r\nanswer me when I say good-bye twice, and stand on the point of going. I\r\ndon\'t even ask to meet you again, for it would torment you. But tell\r\nme, why didn\'t you leave me in peace? What had I done to you? I didn\'t\r\nget in your way, now, did I? Why did you turn away from me all at once,\r\nas if you didn\'t know me any longer? You have plucked me now so\r\nthoroughly bare, made me even more wretched than I ever was at any time\r\nbefore; but, indeed, I am not insane. You know well, if you think it\r\nover, that nothing is the matter with me now. Come over, then, and give\r\nme your hand--or give me leave to go to you, will you? I won\'t do you\r\nany harm; I will only kneel before you, only for a minute--kneel down\r\non the floor before you, only for a minute, may I? No, no; there, I am\r\nnot to do it then, I see. You are getting afraid. I will not, I will\r\nnot do it; do you hear? Lord, why do you get so terrified. I am\r\nstanding quite still; I am not moving. I would have knelt down on the\r\ncarpet for a moment--just there, upon that patch of red, at your feet;\r\nbut you got frightened--I could see it at once in your eyes that you\r\ngot frightened; that was why I stood still. I didn\'t move a step when I\r\nasked you might I, did I? I stood just as immovable as I stand now when\r\nI point out the place to you where I would have knelt before you, over\r\nthere on the crimson rose in the carpet. I don\'t even point with my\r\nfinger. I don\'t point at all; I let it be, not to frighten you. I only\r\nnod and look over at it, like this! and you know perfectly well which\r\nrose I mean, but you won\'t let me kneel there. You are afraid of me,\r\nand dare not come near to me. I cannot conceive how you could have the\r\nheart to call me insane. It isn\'t true; you don\'t believe it, either,\r\nany longer? It was once in the summer, a long time ago, I was mad; I\r\nworked too hard, and forgot to go to dine at the right hour, when I had\r\ntoo much to think about. That happened day after day. I ought to have\r\nremembered it; but I went on forgetting it--by God in Heaven, it is\r\ntrue! God keep me from ever coming alive from this spot if I lie.\r\nThere, you can see, you do me an injustice. It was not out of need I\r\ndid it; I can get credit, much credit, at Ingebret\'s or Gravesen\'s. I\r\noften, too, had a good deal of money in my pocket, and did not buy food\r\nall the same, because I forgot it. Do you hear? You don\'t say anything;\r\nyou don\'t answer; you don\'t stir a bit from the fire; you just stand\r\nand wait for me to go...."\r\n\r\nShe came hurriedly over to me, and stretched out her hand. I looked at\r\nher, full of mistrust. Did she do it with any true heartiness, or did\r\nshe only do it to get rid of me? She wound her arms round my neck; she\r\nhad tears in her eyes; I only stood and looked at her. She offered her\r\nmouth; I couldn\'t believe in her; it was quite certain she was making a\r\nsacrifice as a means of putting an end to all this.\r\n\r\nShe said something; it sounded to me like, "I am fond of you, in spite\r\nof all." She said it very lowly and indistinctly; maybe I did not hear\r\naright. She may not have said just those words; but she cast herself\r\nimpetuously against my breast, clasped both her arms about my neck for\r\na little while, stretched even up a bit on her toes to get a good hold,\r\nand stood so for perhaps a whole minute. I was afraid that she was\r\nforcing herself to show me this tenderness, and I only said:\r\n\r\n"What a darling you are now!"\r\n\r\nMore I didn\'t say. I crushed her in my arms, stepped back, rushed to\r\nthe door, and went out backwards. She remained in there behind me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart IV\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter had set in--a raw, wet winter, almost without snow. A foggy,\r\ndark, and everlasting night, without a single blast of fresh wind the\r\nwhole week through. The gas was lighted almost all the day in the\r\nstreets, and yet people jostled one another in the fog. Every sound,\r\nthe clang of the church bells, the jingling of the harness of the\r\ndroske horses, the people\'s voices, the beat of the hoofs, everything,\r\nsounded choked and jangling through the close air, that penetrated and\r\nmuffled everything.\r\n\r\nWeek followed week, and the weather was, and remained, still the same.\r\n\r\nAnd I stayed steadily down in Vaterland. I grew more and more closely\r\nbound to this inn, this lodging-house for travellers, where I had found\r\nshelter, in spite of my starving condition. My money was exhausted long\r\nsince; and yet I continued to come and go in this place as if I had a\r\nright to it, and was at home there. The landlady had, as yet, said\r\nnothing; but it worried me all the same that I could not pay her. In\r\nthis way three weeks went by. I had already, many days ago, taken to\r\nwriting again; but I could not succeed in putting anything together\r\nthat satisfied me. I had not longer any luck, although I was very\r\npainstaking, and strove early and late; no matter what I attempted, it\r\nwas useless. Good fortune had flown; and I exerted myself in vain.\r\n\r\nIt was in a room on the second floor, the best guest-room, that I sat\r\nand made these attempts. I had been undisturbed up there since the\r\nfirst evening when I had money and was able to settle for what I got.\r\nAll the time I was buoyed up by the hope of at last succeeding in\r\ngetting together an article on some subject or another, so that I could\r\npay for my room, and for whatever else I owed. That was the reason I\r\nworked on so persistently. I had, in particular, commenced a piece from\r\nwhich I expected great things--an allegory about a fire--a profound\r\nthought upon which I intended to expend all my energy, and bring it to\r\nthe "Commandor" in payment. The "Commandor" should see that he had\r\nhelped a talent this time. I had no doubt but that he would eventually\r\nsee that; it only was a matter of waiting till the spirit moved me; and\r\nwhy shouldn\'t the spirit move me? Why should it not come over me even\r\nnow, at a very early date? There was no longer anything the matter with\r\nme. My landlady gave me a little food every day, some bread and butter,\r\nmornings and evenings, and my nervousness had almost flown. I no longer\r\nused cloths round my hands when I wrote; and I could stare down into\r\nthe street from my window on the second floor without getting giddy. I\r\nwas much better in every way, and it was becoming a matter of\r\nastonishment to me that I had not already finished my allegory. I\r\ncouldn\'t understand why it was....\r\n\r\nBut a day came when I was at last to get a clear idea of how weak I had\r\nreally become; with what incapacity my dull brain acted. Namely, on\r\nthis day my landlady came up to me with a reckoning which she asked me\r\nto look over. There must be something wrong in this reckoning, she\r\nsaid; it didn\'t agree with her own book; but she had not been able to\r\nfind out the mistake.\r\n\r\nI set to work to add up. My landlady sat right opposite and looked at\r\nme. I added up these score of figures first once down, and found the\r\ntotal right; then once up again, and arrived at the same result. I\r\nlooked at the woman sitting opposite me, waiting on my words. I noticed\r\nat the same time that she was pregnant; it did not escape my attention,\r\nand yet I did not stare in any way scrutinizingly at her.\r\n\r\n"The total is right," said I.\r\n\r\n"No; go over each figure now," she answered. "I am sure it can\'t be so\r\nmuch; I am positive of it."\r\n\r\nAnd I commenced to check each line--2 loaves at 2 1/2d., 1 lamp\r\nchimney, 3d., soap, 4d., butter, 5d.... It did not require any\r\nparticularly shrewd head to run up these rows of figures--this little\r\nhuckster account in which nothing very complex occurred. I tried\r\nhonestly to find the error that the woman spoke about, but couldn\'t\r\nsucceed. After I had muddled about with these figures for some minutes\r\nI felt that, unfortunately, everything commenced to dance about in my\r\nhead; I could no longer distinguish debit or credit; I mixed the whole\r\nthing up. Finally, I came to a dead stop at the following entry--"3.\r\n5/16ths of a pound of cheese at 9d." My brain failed me completely; I\r\nstared stupidly down at the cheese, and got no farther.\r\n\r\n"It is really too confoundedly crabbed writing," I exclaimed in\r\ndespair. "Why, God bless me, here is 5/16ths of a pound of cheese\r\nentered--ha, ha! did any one ever hear the like? Yes, look here; you\r\ncan see for yourself."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said; "it is often put down like that; it is a kind of Dutch\r\ncheese. Yes, that is all right--five-sixteenths is in this case five\r\nounces."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; I understand that well enough," I interrupted, although in\r\ntruth I understood nothing more whatever.\r\n\r\nI tried once more to get this little account right, that I could have\r\ntotted up in a second some months ago. I sweated fearfully, and thought\r\nover these enigmatical figures with all my might, and I blinked my eyes\r\nreflectingly, as if I was studying this matter sharply, but I had to\r\ngive it up. These five ounces of cheese finished me completely; it was\r\nas if something snapped within my forehead. But yet, to give the\r\nimpression that I still worked out my calculation, I moved my lips and\r\nmuttered a number aloud, all the while sliding farther and farther down\r\nthe reckoning as if I were steadily coming to a result. She sat and\r\nwaited. At last I said:\r\n\r\n"Well, now, I have gone through it from first to last, and there is no\r\nmistake, as far as I can see."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there?" replied the woman, "isn\'t there really?" But I saw well\r\nthat she did not believe me, and she seemed all at once to throw a dash\r\nof contempt into her words, a slightly careless tone that I had never\r\nheard from her before. She remarked that perhaps I was not accustomed\r\nto reckon in sixteenths; she mentioned also that she must only apply to\r\nsome one who had a knowledge of sixteenths, to get the account properly\r\nrevised. She said all this, not in any hurtful way to make me feel\r\nashamed, but thoughtfully and seriously. When she got as far as the\r\ndoor, she said, without looking at me:\r\n\r\n"Excuse me for taking up your time then."\r\n\r\nOff she went.\r\n\r\nA moment after, the door opened again, and she re-entered. She could\r\nhardly have gone much farther than the stairs before she had turned\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said she; "you mustn\'t take it amiss; but there is a\r\nlittle owing to me from you now, isn\'t there? Wasn\'t it three weeks\r\nyesterday since you came?" Yes, I thought it was. "It isn\'t so easy to\r\nkeep things going with such a big family, so that I can\'t give lodging\r\non credit, more\'s the...."\r\n\r\nI stopped her. "I am working at an article that I think I told you\r\nabout before," said I, "and as soon as ever that is finished, you shall\r\nhave your money; you can make yourself quite easy...."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but you\'ll never get that article finished, though."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that? Maybe the spirit will move me tomorrow, or perhaps\r\nalready, tonight; it isn\'t at all impossible but that it may move me\r\nsome time tonight, and then my article will be completed in a quarter\r\nof an hour at the outside. You see, it isn\'t with my work as with other\r\npeople\'s; I can\'t sit down and get a certain amount finished in a day.\r\nI have just to wait for the right moment, and no one can tell the day\r\nor hour when the spirit may move one--it must have its own time...."\r\n\r\nMy landlady went, but her confidence in me was evidently much shaken.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was left alone I jumped up and tore my hair in despair.\r\nNo, in spite of all, there was really no salvation for me--no\r\nsalvation! My brain was bankrupt! Had I then really turned into a\r\ncomplete dolt since I could not even add up the price of a piece of\r\nDutch cheese? But could it be possible I had lost my senses when I\r\ncould stand and put such questions to myself? Had not I, into the\r\nbargain, right in the midst of my efforts with the reckoning, made the\r\nlucid observation that my landlady was in the family way? I had no\r\nreason for knowing it, no one had told me anything about it, neither\r\nhad it occurred to me gratuitously. I sat and saw it with my own eyes,\r\nand I understood it at once, right at a despairing moment where I sat\r\nand added up sixteenths. How could I explain this to myself?\r\n\r\nI went to the window and gazed out; it looked out into Vognmandsgade.\r\nSome children were playing down on the pavement; poorly dressed\r\nchildren in the middle of a poor street. They tossed an empty bottle\r\nbetween them and screamed shrilly. A load of furniture rolled slowly\r\nby; it must belong to some dislodged family, forced to change residence\r\nbetween "flitting time." [Footnote: In Norway, 14th of March and\r\nOctober.] This struck me at once. Bed-clothes and furniture were heaped\r\non the float, moth-eaten beds and chests of drawers, red-painted chairs\r\nwith three legs, mats, old iron, and tin-ware. A little girl--a mere\r\nchild, a downright ugly youngster, with a running cold in her nose--sat\r\nup on top of the load, and held fast with her poor little blue hands in\r\norder not to tumble off. She sat on a heap of frightfully stained\r\nmattresses, that children must have lain on, and looked down at the\r\nurchins who were tossing the empty bottle to one another....\r\n\r\nI stood gazing at all this; I had no difficulty in apprehending\r\neverything that passed before me. Whilst I stood there at the window\r\nand observed this, I could hear my landlady\'s servant singing in the\r\nkitchen right alongside of my room. I knew the air she was singing, and\r\nI listened to hear if she would sing false, and I said to myself that\r\nan idiot could not have done all this.\r\n\r\nI was, God be praised, all right in my senses as any man.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I saw two of the children down in the street fire up and\r\nbegin to abuse one another. Two little boys; I recognized one of them;\r\nhe was my landlady\'s son. I open the window to hear what they are\r\nsaying to one another, and immediately a flock of children crowded\r\ntogether under my window, and looked wistfully up. What did they\r\nexpect? That something would be thrown down? Withered flowers, bones,\r\ncigar ends, or one thing or another, that they could amuse themselves\r\nwith? They looked up with their frost-pinched faces and unspeakably\r\nwistful eyes. In the meantime, the two small foes continued to revile\r\none another.\r\n\r\nWords like great buzzing noxious insects swarm out of their childish\r\nmouths; frightful nicknames, thieves\' slang, sailors\' oaths, that they\r\nperhaps had learnt down on the wharf; and they are both so engaged that\r\nthey do not notice my landlady, who rushes out to see what is going on.\r\n\r\n"Yes," explains her son, "he catched me by the throat; I couldn\'t\r\nbreaths for ever so long," and turning upon the little man who is the\r\ncause of the quarrel, and who is standing grinning maliciously at him,\r\nhe gets perfectly furious, and yells, "Go to hell, Chaldean ass that\r\nyou are! To think such vermin as you should catch folk by the throat. I\r\nwill, may the Lord...."\r\n\r\nAnd the mother, this pregnant woman, who dominates the whole street\r\nwith her size, answers the ten-year-old child, as she seizes him by the\r\narm and tries to drag him in:\r\n\r\n"Sh--sh. Hold your jaw! I just like to hear the way you swear, too, as\r\nif you had been in a brothel for years. Now, in with you."\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you will."\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t."\r\n\r\nI stand up in the window and see that the mother\'s temper is rising;\r\nthis disagreeable scene excites me frightfully. I can\'t endure it any\r\nlonger. I call down to the boy to come up to me for a minute; I call\r\ntwice, just to distract them--to change the scene. The last time I call\r\nvery loudly, and the mother turns round flurriedly and looks up at me.\r\nShe regains her self-possession at once, looks insolently at me, nay,\r\ndownright maliciously, and enters the house with a chiding remark to\r\nher offspring. She talks loudly, so that I may hear it, and says to\r\nhim, "Fie, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to let people see how\r\nnaughty you are."\r\n\r\nOf all this that I stood there and observed not one thing, not even one\r\nlittle accessory detail, was lost on me; my attention was acutely keen;\r\nI absorbed carefully every little thing as I stood and thought out my\r\nown thought, about each thing according as it occurred. So it was\r\nimpossible that there could be anything the matter with my brain. How\r\ncould there, in this case, be anything the matter with it?\r\n\r\nListen; do you know what, said I all at once to myself, that you have\r\nbeen worrying yourself long enough about your brain, giving yourself no\r\nend of worry in this matter? Now, there must be an end to this\r\ntomfoolery. Is it a sign of insanity to notice and apprehend everything\r\nas accurately as you do? You make me almost laugh at you, I reply. To\r\nmy mind it is not without its humorous side, if I am any judge of such\r\na case. Why, it happens to every man that he once in a way sticks fast,\r\nand that, too, just with the simplest question. It is of no\r\nsignificance, it is often a pure accident. As I have remarked before, I\r\nam on the point of having a good laugh at your expense. As far as that\r\nhuckster account is concerned, that paltry five-sixteenths of\r\nbeggar-man\'s cheese, I can happily dub it so. Ha, ha!--a cheese with\r\ncloves and pepper in it; upon my word, a cheese in which, to put the\r\nmatter plainly, one could breed maggots. As far as that ridiculous\r\ncheese is concerned, it might happen to the cleverest fellow in the\r\nworld to be puzzled over it! Why, the smell of the cheese was enough to\r\nfinish a man; ... and I made the greatest fun of this and all other\r\nDutch cheeses.... No; set me to reckon up something really eatable,\r\nsaid I--set me, if you like, at five-sixteenths of good dairy butter.\r\nThat is another matter.\r\n\r\nI laughed feverishly at my own whim, and found it peculiarly diverting.\r\nThere was positively no longer anything the matter with me. I was in\r\ngood form--was, so to say, still in the best of form; I had a level\r\nhead, nothing was wanting there, God be praised and thanked! My mirth\r\nrose in measure as I paced the floor and communed with myself. I\r\nlaughed aloud, and felt amazingly glad. Besides, it really seemed, too,\r\nas if I only needed this little happy hour, this moment of airy\r\nrapture, without a care on any side, to get my head into working order\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nI seated myself at the table, and set to work at my allegory; it\r\nprogressed swimmingly, better than it had done for a long time; not\r\nvery fast, \'tis true, but it seemed to me that what I did was\r\naltogether first-rate. I worked, too, for the space of an hour without\r\ngetting tired.\r\n\r\nI am sitting working at a most crucial point in this Allegory of a\r\nConflagration in a Bookshop. It appears to me so momentous a point,\r\nthat all the rest I have written counted as nothing in comparison. I\r\nwas, namely, just about to weave in, in a downright profound way, this\r\nthought. It was not books that were burning, it was brains, human\r\nbrains; and I intended to make a perfect Bartholomew\'s night of these\r\nburning brains.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my door was flung open with a jerk and in much haste; my\r\nlandlady came sailing in. She came straight over to the middle of the\r\nroom, she did not even pause on the threshold.\r\n\r\nI gave a little hoarse cry; it was just as if I had received a blow.\r\n\r\n"What?" said she, "I thought you said something. We have got a\r\ntraveller, and we must have this room for him. You will have to sleep\r\ndownstairs with us tonight. Yes; you can have a bed to yourself there\r\ntoo." And before she got my answer, she began, without further\r\nceremony, to bundle my papers together on the table, and put the whole\r\nof them into a state of dire confusion.\r\n\r\nMy happy mood was blown to the winds; I stood up at once, in anger and\r\ndespair. I let her tidy the table, and said nothing, never uttered a\r\nsyllable. She thrust all the papers into my hand.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else for me to do. I was forced to leave the room.\r\nAnd so this precious moment was spoilt also. I met the new traveller\r\nalready on the stairs; a young man with great blue anchors tattooed on\r\nthe backs of his hands. A quay porter followed him, bearing a sea-chest\r\non his shoulders. He was evidently a sailor, a casual traveller for the\r\nnight; he would therefore not occupy my room for any lengthened period.\r\nPerhaps, too, I might be lucky tomorrow when the man had left, and have\r\none of my moments again; I only needed an inspiration for five minutes,\r\nand my essay on the conflagration would be completed. Well, I should\r\nhave to submit to fate.\r\n\r\nI had not been inside the family rooms before, this one common room in\r\nwhich they all lived, both day and night--the husband, wife, wife\'s\r\nfather, and four children. The servant lived in the kitchen, where she\r\nalso slept at night. I approached the door with much repugnance, and\r\nknocked. No one answered, yet I heard voices inside.\r\n\r\nThe husband did not speak as I stepped in, did not acknowledge my nod\r\neven, merely glanced at me carelessly, as if I were no concern of his.\r\nBesides, he was sitting playing cards with a person I had seen down on\r\nthe quays, with the by-name of "Pane o\' glass." An infant lay and\r\nprattled to itself over in the bed, and an old man, the landlady\'s\r\nfather, sat doubled together on a settle-bed, and bent his head down\r\nover his hands as if his chest or stomach pained him. His hair was\r\nalmost white, and he looked in his crouching position like a\r\npoke-necked reptile that sat cocking its ears at something.\r\n\r\n"I come, worse luck, to beg for house-room down here tonight," I said\r\nto the man.\r\n\r\n"Did my wife say so?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes; a new lodger came to my room."\r\n\r\nTo this the man made no reply, but proceeded to finger the cards. There\r\nthis man sat, day after day, and played cards with anybody who happened\r\nto come in--played for nothing, only just to kill time, and have\r\nsomething in hand. He never did anything else, only moved just as much\r\nas his lazy limbs felt inclined, whilst his wife bustled up and down\r\nstairs, was occupied on all sides, and took care to draw customers to\r\nthe house. She had put herself in connection with quay-porters and\r\ndock-men, to whom she paid a certain sum for every new lodger they\r\nbrought her, and she often gave them, in addition, a shelter for the\r\nnight. This time it was "Pane o\' glass" that had just brought along the\r\nnew lodger.\r\n\r\nA couple of the children came in--two little girls, with thin,\r\nfreckled, gutter-snipe faces; their clothes were positively wretched. A\r\nwhile after the landlady herself entered. I asked her where she\r\nintended to put me up for the night, and she replied that I could lie\r\nin here together with the others, or out in the ante-room on the sofa,\r\nas I thought fit. Whilst she answered me she fussed about the room and\r\nbusied herself with different things that she set in order, and she\r\nnever once looked at me.\r\n\r\nMy spirits were crushed by her reply.\r\n\r\nI stood down near the door, and made myself small, tried to make it\r\nappear as if I were quite content all the same to change my room for\r\nanother for one night\'s sake. I put on a friendly face on purpose not\r\nto irritate her and perhaps be hustled right out of the house.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes," I said, "there is sure to be some way!" and then\r\nheld my tongue.\r\n\r\nShe still bustled about the room.\r\n\r\n"For that matter, I may as well just tell you that I can\'t afford to\r\ngive people credit for their board and lodging," said she, "and I told\r\nyou that before, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but, my dear woman, it is only for these few days, until I get my\r\narticle finished," I answered, "and I will willingly give you an extra\r\nfive shillings--willingly."\r\n\r\nBut she had evidently no faith in my article, I could see that; and I\r\ncould not afford to be proud, and leave the house, just for a slight\r\nmortification; I knew what awaited me if I went out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days passed over.\r\n\r\nI still associated with the family below, for it was too cold in the\r\nante-room where there was no stove. I slept, too, at night on the floor\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nThe strange sailor continued to lodge in my room, and did not seem like\r\nmoving very quickly. At noon, too, my landlady came in and related how\r\nhe had paid her a month in advance, and besides, he was going to take\r\nhis first-mate\'s examination before leaving, that was why he was\r\nstaying in town. I stood and listened to this, and understood that my\r\nroom was lost to me for ever.\r\n\r\nI went out to the ante-room, and sat down. If I were lucky enough to\r\nget anything written, it would have perforce to be here where it was\r\nquiet. It was no longer the allegory that occupied me; I had got a new\r\nidea, a perfectly splendid plot; I would compose a one-act drama--"The\r\nSign of the Cross." Subject taken from the Middle Ages. I had\r\nespecially thought out everything in connection with the principal\r\ncharacters: a magnificently fanatical harlot who had sinned in the\r\ntemple, not from weakness or desire, but for hate against heaven;\r\nsinner right at the foot of the altar, with the altar-cloth under her\r\nhead, just out of delicious contempt for heaven.\r\n\r\nI grew more and more obsessed by this creation as the hours went on.\r\nShe stood at last, palpably, vividly embodied before my eyes, and was\r\nexactly as I wished her to appear. Her body was to be deformed and\r\nrepulsive, tall, very lean, and rather dark; and when she walked, her\r\nlong limbs should gleam through her draperies at every stride she took.\r\nShe was also to have large outstanding ears. Curtly, she was nothing\r\nfor the eye to dwell upon, barely endurable to look at. What interested\r\nme in her was her wonderful shamelessness, the desperately full measure\r\nof calculated sin which she had committed. She really occupied me too\r\nmuch, my brain was absolutely inflated by this singular monstrosity of\r\na creature, and I worked for two hours, without a pause, at my drama.\r\nWhen I had finished half-a score of pages, perhaps twelve, often with\r\nmuch effort, at times with long intervals, in which I wrote in vain and\r\nhad to tear the page in two, I had become tired, quite stiff with cold\r\nand fatigue, and I arose and went out into the street. For the last\r\nhalf-hour, too, I had been disturbed by the crying of the children\r\ninside the family room, so that I could not, in any case, have written\r\nany more just then. So I took a long time up over Drammensveien, and\r\nstayed away till the evening, pondering incessantly, as I walked along,\r\nas to how I would continue my drama. Before I came home in the evening\r\nof this day, the following happened:\r\n\r\nI stood outside a shoemaker\'s shop far down in Carl Johann Street,\r\nalmost at the railway square. God knows why I stood just outside this\r\nshoemaker\'s shop. I looked into the window as I stood there, but did\r\nnot, by the way, remember that I needed shoes then; my thoughts were\r\nfar away in other parts of the world. A swarm of people talking\r\ntogether passed behind my back, and I heard nothing of what was said.\r\nThen a voice greeted me loudly:\r\n\r\n"Good-evening."\r\n\r\nIt was "Missy" who bade me good-evening! I answered at random, I looked\r\nat him, too, for a while, before I recognized him.\r\n\r\n"Well, how are you getting along?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Oh, always well ... as usual."\r\n\r\n"By the way, tell me," said he, "are you, then, still with Christie?"\r\n\r\n"Christie?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you once said you were book-keeper at Christie\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. No; that is done with. It was impossible to get along with\r\nthat fellow; that came to an end very quickly of its own accord."\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I happened to make a mis-entry one day, and so--"\r\n\r\n"A false entry, eh?"\r\n\r\nFalse entry! There stood "Missy," and asked me straight in the face if\r\nI had done this thing. He even asked eagerly, and evidently with much\r\ninterest. I looked at him, felt deeply insulted, and made no reply.\r\n\r\n"Yes, well, Lord! that might happen to the best fellow," he said, as if\r\nto console me. He still believed I had made a false entry designedly.\r\n\r\n"What is it that, \'Yes, well, Lord! indeed might happen to the best\r\nfellow\'?" I inquired. "To do that. Listen, my good man. Do you stand\r\nthere and really believe that I could for a moment be guilty of such a\r\nmean trick as that? I!"\r\n\r\n"But, my dear fellow, I thought I heard you distinctly say that."\r\n\r\n"No; I said that I had made a mis-entry once, a bagatelle; if you want\r\nto know, a false date on a letter, a single stroke of the pen\r\nwrong--that was my whole crime. No, God be praised, I can tell right\r\nfrom wrong yet a while. How would it fare with me if I were, into the\r\nbargain, to sully my honour? It is simply my sense of honour that keeps\r\nme afloat now. But it is strong enough too; at least, it has kept me up\r\nto date."\r\n\r\nI threw back my head, turned away from "Missy," and looked down the\r\nstreet. My eyes rested on a red dress that came towards us; on a woman\r\nat a man\'s side. If I had not had this conversation with "Missy," I\r\nwould not have been hurt by his coarse suspicion, and I would not have\r\ngiven this toss of my head, as I turned away in offence; and so perhaps\r\nthis red dress would have passed me without my having noticed it. And\r\nat bottom what did it concern me? What was it to me if it were the\r\ndress of the Hon. Miss Nagel, the lady-in-waiting? "Missy" stood and\r\ntalked, and tried to make good his mistake again. I did not listen to\r\nhim at all; I stood the whole time and stared at the red dress that was\r\ncoming nearer up the street, and a stir thrilled through my breast, a\r\ngliding delicate dart. I whispered in thought without moving my lips:\r\n\r\n"Ylajali!"\r\n\r\nNow "Missy" turned round also and noticed the two--the lady and the man\r\nwith her,--raised his hat to them, and followed them with his eyes. I\r\ndid not raise my hat, or perhaps I did unconsciously. The red dress\r\nglided up Carl Johann, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Who was it was with her?" asked "Missy."\r\n\r\n"The Duke, didn\'t you see? The so-called \'Duke.\' Did you know the lady?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in a sort of way. Didn\'t you know her?"\r\n\r\n"No," I replied.\r\n\r\n"It appears to me you saluted profoundly enough."\r\n\r\n"Did I?"\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! perhaps you didn\'t," said "Missy." "Well, that is odd. Why, it\r\nwas only at you she looked, too, the whole time."\r\n\r\n"When did you get to know her?" I asked. He did not really know her. It\r\ndated from an evening in autumn. It was late; they were three jovial\r\nsouls together, they came out late from the Grand, and met this being\r\ngoing along alone past Cammermeyer\'s, and they addressed her. At first\r\nshe answered rebuffingly; but one of the jovial spirits, a man who\r\nneither feared fire nor water, asked her right to her face if he might\r\nnot have the civilized enjoyment of accompanying her home? He would, by\r\nthe Lord, not hurt a hair on her head, as the saying goes--only go with\r\nher to her door, reassure himself that she reached home in safety,\r\notherwise he could not rest all night. He talked incessantly as they\r\nwent along, hit upon one thing or another, dubbed himself Waldemar\r\nAtterdag, and represented himself as a photographer. At last she was\r\nobliged to laugh at this merry soul who refused to be rebuffed by her\r\ncoldness, and it finally ended by his going with her.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, did it? and what came of it?" I inquired; and I held my breath\r\nfor his reply.\r\n\r\n"Came of it? Oh, stop there; there is the lady in question."\r\n\r\nWe both kept silent a moment, both "Missy" and I.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m hanged, was that \'the Duke\'? So that\'s what he looks like,"\r\nhe added, reflectively. "Well, if she is in contact with that fellow;\r\nwell, then, I wouldn\'t like to answer for her."\r\n\r\nI still kept silent. Yes, of course "the Duke" would make the pace with\r\nher. Well, what odds? How did it concern me? I bade her good-day with\r\nall her wiles: a good-day I bade her; and I tried to console myself by\r\nthinking the worst thoughts about her; took a downright pleasure in\r\ndragging her through the mire. It only annoyed me to think that I had\r\ndoffed my hat to the pair, if I really had done so. Why should I raise\r\nmy hat to such people? I did not care for her any longer, certainly\r\nnot; she was no longer in the very slightest degree lovely to me; she\r\nhad fallen off. Ah, the devil knows how soiled I found her! It might\r\neasily have been the case that it was only me she looked at; I was not\r\nin the least astounded at that; it might be regret that began to stir\r\nin her. But that was no reason for me to go and lower myself and\r\nsalute, like a fool, especially when she had become so seriously\r\nbesmirched of late. "The Duke" was welcome to her; I wish him joy! The\r\nday might come when I would just take into my head to pass her\r\nhaughtily by without glancing once towards her. Ay, it might happen\r\nthat I would venture to do this, even if she were to gaze straight into\r\nmy eyes, and have a blood-red gown on into the bargain. It might very\r\neasily happen! Ha, ha! that would be a triumph. If I knew myself\r\naright, I was quite capable of completing my drama during the course of\r\nthe night, and, before eight days had flown, I would have brought this\r\nyoung woman to her knees--with all her charms, ha, ha! with all her\r\ncharms....\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," I muttered, shortly; but "Missy" held me back. He queried:\r\n\r\n"But what do you do all day now?"\r\n\r\n"Do? I write, naturally. What else should I do? Is it not that I live\r\nby? For the moment, I am working at a great drama, \'The Sign of the\r\nCross.\' Theme taken from the Middle Ages."\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" exclaimed "Missy," seriously. "Well, if you succeed with\r\nthat, why...."\r\n\r\n"I have no great anxiety on that score," I replied. "In eight days\'\r\ntime or so, I think you and all the folks will have heard a little more\r\nof me."\r\n\r\nWith that I left him.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home I applied at once to my landlady, and requested a lamp.\r\nIt was of the utmost importance to me to get this lamp; I would not go\r\nto bed tonight; my drama was raging in my brain, and I hoped so surely\r\nto be able to write a good portion of it before morning. I put forward\r\nmy request very humbly to her, as I had noticed that she made a\r\ndissatisfied face on my re-entering the sitting-room. I said that I had\r\nalmost completed a remarkable drama, only a couple of scenes were\r\nwanting; and I hinted that it might be produced in some theatre or\r\nanother, in no time. If she would only just render me this great\r\nservice now....\r\n\r\nBut madam had no lamp. She considered a bit, but could not call to mind\r\nthat she had a lamp in any place. If I liked to wait until twelve\r\no\'clock, I might perhaps get the kitchen lamp. Why didn\'t I buy myself\r\na candle?\r\n\r\nI held my tongue. I hadn\'t a farthing to buy a candle, and knew that\r\nright well. Of course I was foiled again! The servant-girl sat inside\r\nwith us--simply sat in the sitting-room, and was not in the kitchen at\r\nall; so that the lamp up there was not even lit. And I stood and\r\nthought over this, but said no more. Suddenly the girl remarked to me:\r\n\r\n"I thought I saw you come out of the palace a while ago; were you at a\r\ndinner party?" and she laughed loudly at this jest.\r\n\r\nI sat down, took out my papers, and attempted to write something here,\r\nin the meantime. I held the paper on my knees, and gazed persistently\r\nat the floor to avoid being distracted by anything; but it helped not a\r\nwhit; nothing helped me; I got no farther. The landlady\'s two little\r\ngirls came in and made a row with the cat--a queer, sick cat that had\r\nscarcely a hair on it; they blew into its eyes until water sprang out\r\nof them and trickled down its nose. The landlord and a couple of others\r\nsat at a table and played _cent et un_. The wife alone was busy as\r\never, and sat and sewed at some garment. She saw well that I could not\r\nwrite anything in the midst of all this disturbance; but she troubled\r\nherself no more about me; she even smiled when the servant-girl asked\r\nme if I had been out to dine. The whole household had become hostile\r\ntowards me. It was as if I had only needed disgrace of being obliged to\r\nresign my room to a stranger to be treated as a man of no account. Even\r\nthe servant, a little, brown-eyed, street-wench, with a big fringe over\r\nher forehead, and a perfectly flat bosom, poked fun at me in the\r\nevening when I got my ration of bread and butter. She inquired\r\nperpetually where, then, was I in the habit of dining, as she had never\r\nseen me picking my teeth outside the Grand? It was clear that she was\r\naware of my wretched circumstances, and took a pleasure in letting me\r\nknow of it.\r\n\r\nI fall suddenly into thought over all this, and am not able to find a\r\nsolitary speech for my drama. Time upon time I seek in vain; a strange\r\nbuzzing begins inside my head, and I give it up. I thrust the papers\r\ninto my pocket, and look up. The girl is sitting straight opposite me.\r\nI look at her--look at her narrow back and drooping shoulders, that are\r\nnot yet fully developed. What business was it of hers to fly at me?\r\nEven supposing I did come out of the palace, what then? Did it harm her\r\nin any way? She had laughed insolently in the past few days at me, when\r\nI was a bit awkward and stumbled on the stairs, or caught fast on a\r\nnail and tore my coat. It was not later than yesterday that she\r\ngathered up my rough copy, that I had thrown aside in the\r\nante-room--stolen these rejected fragments of my drama, and read them\r\naloud in the room here; made fun of them in every one\'s hearing, just\r\nto amuse herself at my expense. I had never molested her in any way,\r\nand could not recall that I had ever asked her to do me a service. On\r\nthe contrary, I made up my bed on the floor in the ante-room myself, in\r\norder not to give her any trouble with it. She made fun of me, too,\r\nbecause my hair fell out. Hair lay and floated about in the basin I\r\nwashed in the mornings, and she made merry over it. Then my shoes, too,\r\nhad grown rather shabby of late, particularly the one that had been run\r\nover by the bread-van, and she found subject for jesting in them. "God\r\nbless you and your shoes!" said she, looking at them; "they are as wide\r\nas a dog\'s house." And she was right; they were trodden out. But then I\r\ncouldn\'t procure myself any others just at present.\r\n\r\nWhilst I sit and call all this to mind, and marvel over the evident\r\nmalice of the servant, the little girls have begun to tease the old man\r\nover in the bed; they are jumping around him, fully bent on this\r\ndiversion. They both found a straw, which they poked into his ears. I\r\nlooked on at this for a while, and refrained from interfering. The old\r\nfellow did not move a finger to defend himself; he only looked at his\r\ntormentors with furious eyes each time they prodded him, and jerked his\r\nhead to escape when the straws were already in his ears. I got more and\r\nmore irritated at this sight, and could not keep my eyes away from it.\r\nThe father looked up from his cards, and laughed at the youngsters; he\r\nalso drew the attention of his comrades at play to what was going on.\r\nWhy didn\'t the old fellow move? Why didn\'t he fling the children aside\r\nwith his arms? I took a stride, and approached the bed.\r\n\r\n"Let them alone! let them alone! he is paralysed," called the landlord.\r\n\r\nAnd out of fear to be shown the door for the night, simply out of fear\r\nof rousing the man\'s displeasure by interfering with this scene, I\r\nstepped back silently to my old place and kept myself quiet. Why should\r\nI risk my lodging and my portion of bread and butter by poking my nose\r\ninto the family squabbles? No idiotic pranks for the sake of a\r\nhalf-dying old man, and I stood and felt as delightfully hard as a\r\nflint.\r\n\r\nThe little urchins did not cease their plaguing; it amused them that\r\nthe old chap could not hold his head quiet, and they aimed at his eyes\r\nand nostrils. He stared at them with a ludicrous expression; he said\r\nnothing, and could not stir his arms. Suddenly he raised the upper part\r\nof his body a little and spat in the face of one of the little girls,\r\ndrew himself up again and spat at the other, but did not reach her. I\r\nstood and looked on, saw that the landlord flung the cards on the table\r\nat which he sat, and sprang over towards the bed. His face was flushed,\r\nand he shouted:\r\n\r\n"Will you sit and spit right into people\'s eyes, you old boar?"\r\n\r\n"But, good Lord, he got no peace from them!" I cried, beside myself.\r\n\r\nBut all the time I stood in fear of being turned out, and I certainly\r\ndid not utter my protest with any particular force; I only trembled\r\nover my whole body with irritation. He turned towards me, and said:\r\n\r\n"Eh, listen to him, then. What the devil is it to you? You just keep\r\nyour tongue in your jaw, you--just mark what I tell you, \'twill serve\r\nyou best."\r\n\r\nBut now the wife\'s voice made itself heard, and the house was filled\r\nwith scolding and railing.\r\n\r\n"May God help me, but I think you are mad or possessed, the whole pack\r\nof you!" she shrieked. "If you want to stay in here you\'ll have to be\r\nquiet, both of you! Humph! it isn\'t enough that one is to keep open\r\nhouse and food for vermin, but one is to have sparring and rowing and\r\nthe devil\'s own to-do in the sitting-room as well. But I won\'t have any\r\nmore of it, not if I know it. Sh--h! Hold your tongues, you brats\r\nthere, and wipe your noses, too; if you don\'t, I\'ll come and do it. I\r\nnever saw the like of such people. Here they walk in out of the street,\r\nwithout even a penny to buy flea-powder, and begin to kick up rows in\r\nthe middle of the night and quarrel with the people who own the house,\r\nI don\'t mean to have any more of it, do you understand that? and you\r\ncan go your way, every one who doesn\'t belong home here. I am going to\r\nhave peace in my own quarters, I am."\r\n\r\nI said nothing, I never opened my mouth once. I sat down again next the\r\ndoor and listened to the noise. They all screamed together, even the\r\nchildren, and the girl who wanted to explain how the whole disturbance\r\ncommenced. If I only kept quiet it would all blow over sometime; it\r\nwould surely not come to the worst if I only did not utter a word; and\r\nwhat word after all could I have to say? Was it not perhaps winter\r\noutside, and far advanced into the night, besides? Was that a time to\r\nstrike a blow, and show one could hold one\'s own? No folly now!... So I\r\nsat still and made no attempt to leave the house; I never even blushed\r\nat keeping silent, never felt ashamed, although I had almost been shown\r\nthe door. I stared coolly, case-hardened, at the wall where Christ hung\r\nin an oleograph, and held my tongue obstinately during all the\r\nlandlady\'s attack.\r\n\r\n"Well, if it is me you want to get quit of, ma\'am, there will be\r\nnothing in the way as far as I am concerned," said one of the\r\ncard-players as he stood up. The other card-players rose as well.\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t mean you--nor you either," replied the landlady to them.\r\n"If there\'s any need to, I will show well enough who I mean, if there\'s\r\nthe least need to, if I know myself rightly. Oh, it will be shown quick\r\nenough who it is...."\r\n\r\nShe talked with pauses, gave me these thrusts at short intervals, and\r\nspun it out to make it clearer and clearer that it was me she meant.\r\n"Quiet," said I to myself; "only keep quiet!" She had not asked me to\r\ngo--not expressly, not in plain words. Just no putting on side on my\r\npart--no untimely pride! Brave it out!... That was really most singular\r\ngreen hair on that Christ in the oleograph. It was not too unlike green\r\ngrass, or expressed with exquisite exactitude thick meadow grass. Ha! a\r\nperfectly correct remark--unusually thick meadow grass.... A train of\r\nfleeting ideas darts at this moment through my head. From green grass\r\nto the text, Each life is like unto grass that is kindled; from that to\r\nthe Day of Judgment, when all will be consumed; then a little detour\r\ndown to the earthquake in Lisbon, about which something floated before\r\nme in reference to a brass Spanish spittoon and an ebony pen handle\r\nthat I had seen down at Ylajali\'s. Ah, yes, all was transitory, just\r\nlike grass that was kindled. It all ended in four planks and a\r\nwinding-sheet. "Winding-sheets to be had from Miss Andersen\'s, on the\r\nright of the door...." And all this was tossed about in my head during\r\nthe despairing moment when my landlady was about to thrust me from her\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t hear," she yelled. "I tell you, you\'ll quit this house. Now\r\nyou know it. I believe God blast me, that the man is mad, I do! Now,\r\nout you go, on the blessed spot, and so no more chat about it."\r\n\r\nI looked towards the door, not in order to leave--no, certainly not in\r\norder to leave. An audacious notion seized me--if there had been a key\r\nin the door, I would have turned it and locked myself in along with the\r\nrest to escape going. I had a perfectly hysterical dread of going out\r\ninto the streets again.\r\n\r\nBut there was no key in the door.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly my landlord\'s voice mingled with that of his wife, and I\r\nstood still with amazement. The same man who had threatened me a while\r\nago took my part, strangely enough now. He said:\r\n\r\n"No, it won\'t do to turn folk out at night; do you know one can be\r\npunished for doing that?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know if there was a punishment for that; I couldn\'t say, but\r\nperhaps it was so," and the wife bethought herself quickly, grew quiet,\r\nand spoke no more.\r\n\r\nShe placed two pieces of bread and butter before me for supper, but I\r\ndid not touch them, just out of gratitude to the man; so I pretended\r\nthat I had had a little food in town.\r\n\r\nWhen at length I took myself off to the anteroom to go to bed, she came\r\nout after me, stopped on the threshold, and said loudly, whilst her\r\nunsightly figure seemed to strut out towards me:\r\n\r\n"But this is the last night you sleep here, so now you know it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," I replied.\r\n\r\nThere would perhaps be some way of finding a shelter tomorrow, if I\r\ntried hard for it. I would surely be able to find some hiding-place.\r\nFor the time being I would rejoice that I was not obliged to go out\r\ntonight.\r\n\r\nI slept till between five and six in the morning--it was not yet light\r\nwhen I awoke--but all the same I got up at once. I had lain in all my\r\nclothes on account of the cold, and had no dressing to do. When I had\r\ndrunk a little cold water and opened the door quietly, I went out\r\ndirectly, for I was afraid to face my landlady again.\r\n\r\nA couple of policemen who had been on watch all night were the only\r\nliving beings I saw in the street. A while after, some men began to\r\nextinguish the lamps. I wandered about without aim or end, reached\r\nKirkegaden and the road down towards the fortress. Cold and still\r\nsleepy, weak in the knees and back after my long walk, and very hungry,\r\nI sat down on a seat and dozed for a long time. For three weeks I had\r\nlived exclusively on the bread and butter that my landlady had given me\r\nmorning and evening. Now it was twenty-four hours since I had had my\r\nlast meal. Hunger began to gnaw badly at me again; I must seek a help\r\nfor it right quickly. With this thought I fell asleep again upon the\r\nseat....\r\n\r\nI was aroused by the sound of people speaking near me, and when I had\r\ncollected myself a little I saw that it was broad day, and that every\r\none was up and about. I got up and walked away. The sun burst over the\r\nheights, the sky was pale and tender, and in my delight over the lovely\r\nmorning, after the many dark gloomy weeks, I forgot all cares, and it\r\nseemed to me as if I had fared worse on other occasions. I clapped\r\nmyself on the chest and sang a little snatch for myself. My voice\r\nsounded so wretched, downright exhausted it sounded, and I moved myself\r\nto tears with it. This magnificent day, the white heavens swimming in\r\nlight, had far too mighty an effect upon me, and I burst into loud\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with you?" inquired a man. I did not answer, but\r\nhurried away, hiding my face from all men. I reached the bridge. A\r\nlarge barque with the Russian flag lay and discharged coal. I read her\r\nname, _Cop\xc3\xa9goro_, on her side. It distracted me for a time to watch\r\nwhat took place on board this foreign ship. She must be almost\r\ndischarged; she lay with IX foot visible on her side, in spite of all\r\nthe ballast she had already taken in, and there was a hollow boom\r\nthrough the whole ship whenever the coal-heavers stamped on the deck\r\nwith their heavy boots.\r\n\r\nThe sun, the light, and the salt breath from the sea, all this busy,\r\nmerry life pulled me together a bit, and caused my blood to run\r\nlustily. Suddenly it entered my head that I could work at a few scenes\r\nof my drama whilst I sat here, and I took my papers out of my pocket.\r\n\r\nI tried to place a speech into a monk\'s mouth--a speech that ought to\r\nswell with pride and intolerance, but it was of no use; so I skipped\r\nover the monk and tried to work out an oration--the Deemster\'s oration\r\nto the violator of the Temple,--and I wrote half-a-page of this\r\noration, upon which I stopped. The right local colour would not tinge\r\nmy words, the bustle about me, the shanties, the noise of the gangways,\r\nand the ceaseless rattle of the iron chains, fitted in so little with\r\nthe atmosphere of the musty air of the dim Middle Ages, that was to\r\nenvelop my drama as with a mist.\r\n\r\nI bundled my papers together and got up.\r\n\r\nAll the same, I got into a happy vein--a grand vein,--and I felt\r\nconvinced that I could effect something if all went well.\r\n\r\nIf I only had a place to go to. I thought over it--stopped right there\r\nin the street and pondered, but I could not bring to mind a single\r\nquiet spot in the town where I could seat myself for an hour. There was\r\nno other way open; I would have to go back to the lodging-house in\r\nVaterland. I shrank at the thought of it, and I told myself all the\r\nwhile that it would not do. I went ahead all the same, and approached\r\nnearer and nearer to the forbidden spot. Of course it was wretched. I\r\nadmitted to myself that it was degrading--downright degrading, but\r\nthere was no help for it. I was not in the least proud; I dared make\r\nthe assertion roundly, that I was one of the least arrogant beings up\r\nto date. I went ahead.\r\n\r\nI pulled up at the door and weighed it over once more. Yes, no matter\r\nwhat the result was, I would have to dare it. After all said and done,\r\nwhat a bagatelle to make such a fuss about. For the first it was only a\r\nmatter of a couple of hours; for the second, the Lord forbid that I\r\nshould ever seek refuge in such a house again. I entered the yard. Even\r\nwhilst I was crossing the uneven stones I was irresolute, and almost\r\nturned round at the very door. I clenched my teeth. No! no pride! At\r\nthe worst I could excuse myself by saying I had come to say good-bye,\r\nto make a proper adieu, and come to a clear understanding about my debt\r\nto the house....\r\n\r\nI took forth my papers once more, and determined to thrust all\r\nirrelevant impressions aside. I had left off right in the middle of a\r\nsentence in the inquisitor\'s address--"Thus dictate God and the law to\r\nme, thus dictates also the counsel of my wise men, thus dictate I and\r\nmy own conscience...." I looked out of the window to think over what\r\nhis conscience should dictate to him. A little row reached me from the\r\nroom inside. Well, it was no affair of mine anyway; it was entirely and\r\ntotally indifferent to me what noise arose. Why the devil should I sit\r\nthinking about it? Keep quiet now! "Thus dictate I and my own\r\nconscience...." But everything conspired against me. Outside in the\r\nstreet, something was taking place that disturbed me. A little lad sat\r\nand amused himself in the sun on the opposite side of the pavement. He\r\nwas happy and in fear of no danger--just sat and knotted together a lot\r\nof paper streamers, and injuring no one. Suddenly he jumps up and\r\nbegins to curse; he goes backwards to the middle of the street and\r\ncatches sight of a man, a grown-up man, with a red beard, who is\r\nleaning out of an open window in the second storey, and who spat down\r\non his head. The little chap cried with rage, and swore impatiently up\r\nat the window; and the man laughed in his face. Perhaps five minutes\r\npassed in this way. I turned aside to avoid seeing the little lad\'s\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"Thus dictate I and my own conscience...." I found it impossible to get\r\nany farther. At last everything began to get confused; it seemed to me\r\nthat even that which I had already written was unfit to use, ay, that\r\nthe whole idea was contemptible rubbish. How could one possibly talk of\r\nconscience in the Middle Ages? Conscience was first invented by\r\nDancing-master Shakespeare, consequently my whole address was wrong.\r\nWas there, then, nothing of value in these pages? I ran through them\r\nanew, and solved my doubt at once. I discovered grand pieces--downright\r\nlengthy pieces of remarkable merit--and once again the intoxicating\r\ndesire to set to work again darted through my breast--the desire to\r\nfinish my drama.\r\n\r\nI got up and went to the door, without paying any attention to my\r\nlandlord\'s furious signs to go out quietly; I walked out of the room\r\nfirmly, and with my mind made up. I went upstairs to the second floor,\r\nand entered my former room. The man was not there, and what was to\r\nhinder me from sitting here for a moment? I would not touch one of his\r\nthings. I wouldn\'t even once use his table; I would just seat myself on\r\na chair near the door, and be happy. I spread the papers hurriedly out\r\non my knees. Things went splendidly for a few minutes. Retort upon\r\nretort stood ready in my head, and I wrote uninterruptedly. I filled\r\none page after the other, dashed ahead over stock and stone, chuckled\r\nsoftly in ecstasy over my happy vein, and was scarcely conscious of\r\nmyself. The only sound I heard in this moment was my own merry chuckle.\r\n\r\nA singularly happy idea had just struck me about a church bell--a\r\nchurch bell that was to peal out at a certain point in my drama. All\r\nwas going ahead with overwhelming rapidity. Then I heard a step on the\r\nstairs. I tremble, and am almost beside myself; sit ready to bolt,\r\ntimorous, watchful, full of fear at everything, and excited by hunger.\r\nI listen nervously, just hold the pencil still in my hand, and listen.\r\nI cannot write a word more. The door opens and the pair from below\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nEven before I had time to make an excuse for what I had done, the\r\nlandlady calls out, as if struck of a heap with amazement:\r\n\r\n"Well, God bless and save us, if he isn\'t sitting here again!"\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," I said, and I would have added more, but got no farther;\r\nthe landlady flung open the door, as far as it would go, and shrieked:\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t go out, now, may God blast me, but I\'ll fetch the police!"\r\n\r\nI got up.\r\n\r\n"I only wanted to say good-bye to you," I murmured; "and I had to wait\r\nfor you. I didn\'t touch anything; I only just sat here on the chair...."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; there was no harm in that," said the man. "What the devil\r\ndoes it matter? Let the man alone; he--"\r\n\r\nBy this time I had reached the end of the stairs. All at once I got\r\nfurious with this fat, swollen woman, who followed close to my heels to\r\nget rid of me quickly, and I stood quiet a moment with the worst\r\nabusive epithets on my tongue ready to sling at her. But I bethought\r\nmyself in time, and held my peace, if only out of gratitude to the\r\nstranger man who followed her, and would have to hear them. She trod\r\nclose on my heels, railing incessantly, and my anger increased with\r\nevery step I took.\r\n\r\nWe reached the yard below. I walked very slowly, still debating whether\r\nI would not have it out with her. I was at this moment completely\r\nblinded with rage, and I searched for the worst word--an expression\r\nthat would strike her dead on the spot, like a kick in her stomach. A\r\ncommissionaire passes me at the entrance. He touches his hat; I take no\r\nnotice; he applies to her; and I hear that he inquires for me, but I do\r\nnot turn round. A couple of steps outside the door he overtakes and\r\nstops me. He hands me an envelope. I tear it open, roughly and\r\nunwillingly. It contains half-a-sovereign--no note, not a word. I look\r\nat the man, and ask:\r\n\r\n"What tomfoolery is this? Who is the letter from?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that I can\'t say!" he replies; "but it was a lady who gave it to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nI stood still. The commissionaire left.\r\n\r\nI put the coin into the envelope again, crumple it up, coin and\r\nenvelope, wheel round and go straight towards the landlady, who is\r\nstill keeping an eye on me from the doorway, and throw it in her face.\r\nI said nothing; I uttered no syllable--only noticed that she was\r\nexamining the crumpled paper as I left her.... Ha! that is what one\r\nmight call comporting oneself with dignity. Not to say a word, not to\r\nmention the contents, but crumple together, with perfect calmness, a\r\nlarge piece of money, and fling it straight in the face of one\'s\r\npersecutor! One might call that making one\'s exit with dignity. That\r\nwas the way to treat such beasts I....\r\n\r\nWhen I got to the corner of Tomtegaden and the railway place, the\r\nstreet commenced suddenly to swim around before my eyes; it buzzed\r\nvacantly in my head, and I staggered up against the wall of a house. I\r\ncould simply go no farther, couldn\'t even straighten myself from the\r\ncramped position I was in. As I fell up against it, so I remained\r\nstanding, and I felt that I was beginning to lose my senses. My insane\r\nanger had augmented this attack of exhaustion. I lifted my foot, and\r\nstamped on the pavement. I also tried several other things to try and\r\nregain my strength: I clenched my teeth, wrinkled my brows, and rolled\r\nmy eyes despairingly; it helped a little. My thoughts grew more lucid.\r\nIt was clear to me that I was about to succumb. I stretched out my\r\nhands, and pushed myself back from the wall. The street still danced\r\nwildly round me. I began to hiccough with rage, and I wrestled from my\r\nvery inmost soul with my misery; made a right gallant effort not to\r\nsink down. It was not my intention to collapse; no, I would die\r\nstanding. A dray rolls slowly by, and I notice there are potatoes in\r\nit; but out of sheer fury and stubbornness, I take it into my head to\r\nassert that they are not potatoes, but cabbages, and I swore frightful\r\noaths that they were cabbages. I heard quite well what I was saying,\r\nand I swore this lie wittingly; repeating time after time, just to have\r\nthe vicious satisfaction of perjuring myself. I got intoxicated with\r\nthe thought of this matchless sin of mine. I raised three fingers in\r\nthe air, and swore, with trembling lips, in the name of the Father,\r\nSon, and Holy Ghost, that they were cabbages.\r\n\r\nTime went. I let myself sink down on the steps near me, and dried the\r\nsweat from my brow and throat, drew a couple of long breaths, and\r\nforced myself into calmness. The sun slid down; it declined towards the\r\nafternoon. I began once more to brood over my condition. My hunger was\r\nreally something disgraceful, and, in a few hours more, night would be\r\nhere again. The question was, to think of a remedy while there was yet\r\ntime. My thoughts flew again to the lodging-house from which I had been\r\nhunted away. I could on no account return there; but yet one could not\r\nhelp thinking about it. Properly speaking, the woman was acting quite\r\nwithin her rights in turning me out. How could I expect to get lodging\r\nwith any one when I could not pay for it? Besides, she had occasionally\r\ngiven me a little food; even yesterday evening, after I had annoyed\r\nher, she offered me some bread and butter. She offered it to me out of\r\nsheer good nature, because she knew I needed it, so I had no cause to\r\ncomplain. I began, even whilst I sat there on the step, to ask her\r\npardon in my own mind for my behaviour. Particularly, I regretted\r\nbitterly that I had shown myself ungrateful to her at the last, and\r\nthrown half-a-sovereign in her face....\r\n\r\nHalf-a-sovereign! I gave a whistle. The letter the messenger brought\r\nme, where did it come from? It was only this instant I thought clearly\r\nover this, and I divined at once how the whole thing hung together. I\r\ngrew sick with pain and shame. I whispered "Ylajali" a few times, with\r\nhoarse voice, and flung back my head. Was it not I who, no later than\r\nyesterday, had decided to pass her proudly by if I met her, to treat\r\nher with the greatest indifference? Instead of that, I had only aroused\r\nher compassion, and coaxed an alms from her. No, no, no; there would\r\nnever be an end to my degradation! Not even in her presence could I\r\nmaintain a decent position. I sank, simply sank, on all sides--every\r\nway I turned; sank to my knees, sank to my waist, dived under in\r\nignominy, never to rise again--never! This was the climax! To accept\r\nhalf-a-sovereign in alms without being able to fling it back to the\r\nsecret donor; scramble for half-pence whenever the chance offered, and\r\nkeep them, use them for lodging money, in spite of one\'s intense inner\r\naversion....\r\n\r\nCould I not regain the half-sovereign in some way or another? To go\r\nback to the landlady and try to get it from her would be of no use.\r\nThere must be some way, if I were to consider--if I were only to exert\r\nmyself right well, and consider it over. It was not, in this case,\r\ngreat God, sufficient to consider in just an ordinary way! I must\r\nconsider so that it penetrated my whole sentient being; consider and\r\nfind some way to procure this half-sovereign. And I set to, to consider\r\nthe answer to this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might be about four o\'clock; in a few hours\' time I could perhaps\r\nmeet the manager of the theatre; if only I had my drama completed.\r\n\r\nI take out my MSS. there where I am sitting, and resolve, with might\r\nand main, to finish the last few scenes. I think until I sweat, and\r\nre-read from the beginning, but make no progress. No bosh! I say--no\r\nobstinacy, now! and I write away at my drama--write down everything\r\nthat strikes me, just to get finished quickly and be able to go away. I\r\ntried to persuade myself that a new supreme moment had seized me; I\r\nlied right royally to myself, deceived myself knowingly, and wrote on,\r\nas if I had no need to seek for words.\r\n\r\nThat is capital! That is really a find! whispered I, interpolatingly;\r\nonly just write it down! Halt! they sound questionable; they contrast\r\nrather strongly with the speeches in the first scenes; not a trace of\r\nthe Middle Ages shone through the monk\'s words. I break my pencil\r\nbetween my teeth, jump to my feet, tear my manuscript in two, tear each\r\npage in two, fling my hat down in the street and trample upon it. I am\r\nlost! I whisper to myself. Ladies and gentlemen, I am lost! I utter no\r\nmore than these few words as long as I stand there, and tramp upon my\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nA policeman is standing a few steps away, watching me. He is standing\r\nin the middle of the street, and he only pays attention to me. As I\r\nlift my head, our eyes meet. Maybe he has been standing there for a\r\nlong time watching me. I pick up my hat, put it on, and go over to him.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what time it is?" I ask. He pauses a bit as he hauls out\r\nhis watch, and never takes his eyes off me the whole time.\r\n\r\n"About four," he replies.\r\n\r\n"Accurately," I say, "about four, perfectly accurate. You know your\r\nbusiness, and I\'ll bear you in mind." Thereupon I left him. He looked\r\nutterly amazed at me, stood and looked at me, with gaping mouth, still\r\nholding his watch in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhen I got in front of the Royal Hotel I turned and looked back. He was\r\nstill standing in the same position, following me with his eyes.\r\n\r\nHa, ha! That is the way to treat brutes! With the most refined\r\neffrontery! That impresses the brutes--puts the fear of God into\r\nthem.... I was peculiarly satisfied with myself, and began to sing a\r\nlittle strain. Every nerve was tense with excitement. Without feeling\r\nany more pain, without even being conscious of discomfort of any kind,\r\nI walked, light as a feather, across the whole market, turned round at\r\nthe stalls, and came to a halt--sat down on a bench near Our Saviour\'s\r\nChurch. Might it not just as well be a matter of indifference whether I\r\nreturned the half-sovereign or not? When once I received it, it was\r\nmine; and there was evidently no want where it came from. Besides, I\r\nwas obliged to take it when it was sent expressly to me; there could be\r\nno object in letting the messenger keep it. It wouldn\'t do, either, to\r\nsend it back--a whole half-sovereign that had been sent to me. So there\r\nwas positively no help for it.\r\n\r\nI tried to watch the bustle about me in the market, and distract myself\r\nwith indifferent things, but I did not succeed; the half-sovereign\r\nstill busied my thoughts. At last I clenched my fists and got angry. It\r\nwould hurt her if I were to send it back. Why, then, should I do so?\r\nAlways ready to consider myself too good for everything--to toss my\r\nhead and say, No, thanks! I saw now what it led to. I was out in the\r\nstreet again. Even when I had the opportunity I couldn\'t keep my good\r\nwarm lodging. No; I must needs be proud, jump up at the first word, and\r\nshow I wasn\'t the man to stand trifling, chuck half-sovereigns right\r\nand left, and go my way.... I took myself sharply to task for having\r\nleft my lodging and brought myself into the most distressful\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest, I consigned the whole affair to the keeping of the\r\nyellowest of devils. I hadn\'t begged for the half-sovereign, and I had\r\nbarely had it in my hand, but gave it away at once--paid it away to\r\nutterly strange people whom I would never see again. That was the sort\r\nof man I was; I always paid out to the last doit whatever I owed. If I\r\nknew Ylajali aright, neither did she regret that she had sent me the\r\nmoney, therefore why did I sit there working myself into a rage? To put\r\nit plainly, the least she could do was to send me half-a-sovereign now\r\nand then. The poor girl was indeed in love with me--ha! perhaps even\r\nfatally in love with me; ... and I sat and puffed myself up with this\r\nnotion. There was no doubt that she was in love with me, the poor girl.\r\n\r\nIt struck five o\'clock! Again I sank under the weight of my prolonged\r\nnervous excitement. The hollow whirring in my head made itself felt\r\nanew. I stared straight ahead, kept my eyes fixed, and gazed at the\r\nchemist\'s under the sign of the elephant. Hunger was waging a fierce\r\nbattle in me at this moment, and I was suffering greatly. Whilst I sit\r\nthus and look out into space, a figure becomes little by little clear\r\nto my fixed stare. At last I can distinguish it perfectly plainly, and\r\nI recognize it. It is that of the cake-vendor who sits habitually near\r\nthe chemist\'s under the sign of the elephant. I give a start, sit\r\nhalf-upright on the seat, and begin to consider. Yes, it was quite\r\ncorrect--the same woman before the same table on the same spot! I\r\nwhistle a few times and snap my fingers, rise from my seat, and make\r\nfor the chemist\'s. No nonsense at all! What the devil was it to me if\r\nit was the wages of sin, or well-earned Norwegian huckster pieces of\r\nsilver from Kongsberg? I wasn\'t going to be abused; one might die of\r\ntoo much pride....\r\n\r\nI go on to the corner, take stock of the woman, and come to a\r\nstandstill before her. I smile, nod as to an acquaintance, and shape my\r\nwords as if it were a foregone conclusion that I would return sometime.\r\n\r\n"Good-day," say I; "perhaps you don\'t recognize me again."\r\n\r\n"No," she replied slowly, and looks at me.\r\n\r\nI smile still more, as if this were only an excellent joke of hers,\r\nthis pretending not to know me again, and say:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you recollect that I gave you a lot of silver once? I did not\r\nsay anything on the occasion in question; as far as I can call to mind,\r\nI did not; it is not my way to do so. When one has honest folk to deal\r\nwith, it is unnecessary to make an agreement, so to say, draw up a\r\ncontract for every trifle. Ha, ha! Yes, it was I who gave you the\r\nmoney!"\r\n\r\n"No, then, now; was it you? Yes, I remember you, now that I come to\r\nthink over it...."\r\n\r\nI wanted to prevent her from thanking me for the money, so I say,\r\ntherefore, hastily, whilst I cast my eye over the table in search of\r\nsomething to eat:\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'ve come now to get the cakes."\r\n\r\nShe did not seem to take this in.\r\n\r\n"The cakes," I reiterate; "I\'ve come now to get them--at any rate, the\r\nfirst instalment; I don\'t need all of them today."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come to get them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; of course I\'ve come to get them," I reply, and I laugh\r\nboisterously, as if it ought to have been self-evident to her from the\r\noutset that I came for that purpose. I take, too, a cake up from the\r\ntable, a sort of white roll that I commenced to eat.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman sees this, she stirs uneasily inside her bundle of\r\nclothes, makes an involuntary movement as if to protect her wares, and\r\ngives me to understand that she had not expected me to return to rob\r\nher of them.\r\n\r\n"Really not?" I say, "indeed, really not?" She certainly was an\r\nextraordinary woman. Had she, then, at any time, had the experience\r\nthat some one came and gave her a heap of shillings to take care of,\r\nwithout that person returning and demanding them again? No; just look\r\nat that now! Did she perhaps run away with the idea that it was stolen\r\nmoney, since I slung it at her in that manner? No; she didn\'t think\r\nthat either. Well, that at least was a good thing--really a good thing.\r\nIt was, if I might so say, kind of her, in spite of all, to consider me\r\nan honest man. Ha, ha! yes indeed, she really was good!\r\n\r\nBut why did I give her the money, then? The woman was exasperated, and\r\ncalled out loudly about it. I explained why I had given her the money,\r\nexplained it temperately and with emphasis. It was my custom to act in\r\nthis manner, because I had such a belief in every one\'s goodness.\r\nAlways when any one offered me an agreement, a receipt, I only shook my\r\nhead and said: No, thank you! God knows I did.\r\n\r\nBut still the woman failed to comprehend it. I had recourse to other\r\nexpedients--spoke sharply, and bade a truce to all nonsense. Had it\r\nnever happened to her before that any one had paid her in advance in\r\nthis manner? I inquired--I meant, of course, people who could afford\r\nit--for example, any of the consuls? Never? Well, I could not be\r\nexpected to suffer because it happened to be a strange mode of\r\nprocedure to her. It was a common practice abroad. She had perhaps\r\nnever been outside the boundaries of her own country? No? Just look at\r\nthat now! In that case, she could of course have no opinion on the\r\nsubject; ... and I took several more cakes from the table.\r\n\r\nShe grumbled angrily, refused obstinately to give up any more of her\r\nstores from off the table, even snatched a piece of cake out of my hand\r\nand put it back into its place. I got enraged, banked the table, and\r\nthreatened to call the police. I wished to be lenient with her, I said.\r\nWere I to take all that was lawfully mine, I would clear her whole\r\nstand, because it was a big sum of money that I had given to her. But I\r\nhad no intention of taking so much, I wanted in reality only half the\r\nvalue of the money, and I would, into the bargain, never come back to\r\ntrouble her again. Might God preserve me from it, seeing that that was\r\nthe sort of creature she was.... At length she shoved some cakes\r\ntowards me, four or five, at an exorbitant price, the highest possible\r\nprice she could think of, and bade me take them and begone. I wrangled\r\nstill with her, persisted that she had at least cheated me to the\r\nextent of a shilling, besides robbing me with her exorbitant prices.\r\n"Do you know there is a penalty for such rascally trickery," said I;\r\n"God help you, you might get penal servitude for life, you old fool!"\r\nShe flung another cake to me, and, with almost gnashing teeth, begged\r\nme to go.\r\n\r\nAnd I left her.\r\n\r\nHa! a match for this dishonest cake-vendor was not to be found. The\r\nwhole time, whilst I walked to and fro in the market-place and ate my\r\ncakes, I talked loudly about this creature and her shamelessness,\r\nrepeated to myself what we both had said to one another, and it seemed\r\nto me that I had come out of this affair with flying colours, leaving\r\nher nowhere. I ate my cakes in face of everybody and talked this over\r\nto myself.\r\n\r\nThe cakes disappeared one by one; they seemed to go no way; no matter\r\nhow I ate I was still greedily hungry. Lord, to think they were of no\r\nhelp! I was so ravenous that I was even about to devour the last little\r\ncake that I had decided to spare, right from the beginning, to put it\r\naside, in fact, for the little chap down in Vognmandsgade--the little\r\nlad who played with the paper streamers. I thought of him\r\ncontinually--couldn\'t forget his face as he jumped and swore. He had\r\nturned round towards the window when the man spat down on him, and he\r\nhad just looked up to see if I was laughing at him. God knows if I\r\nshould meet him now, even if I went down that way.\r\n\r\nI exerted myself greatly to try and reach Vognmandsgade, passed quickly\r\nby the spot where I had torn my drama into tatters, and where some\r\nscraps of papers still lay about; avoided the policeman whom I had\r\namazed by my behaviour, and reached the steps upon which the laddie had\r\nbeen sitting.\r\n\r\nHe was not there. The street was almost deserted--dusk was gathering\r\nin, and I could not see him anywhere. Perhaps he had gone in. I laid\r\nthe cake down, stood it upright against the door, knocked hard, and\r\nhurried away directly. He is sure to find it, I said to myself; the\r\nfirst thing he will do when he comes out will be to find it. And my\r\neyes grew moist with pleasure at the thought of the little chap finding\r\nthe cake.\r\n\r\nI reached the terminus again.\r\n\r\nNow I no longer felt hungry, only the sweet stuff I had eaten began to\r\ncause me discomfort. The wildest thoughts, too surged up anew in my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nSupposing I were in all secretness to cut the hawser mooring one of\r\nthose ships? Supposing I were to suddenly yell out "Fire"? I walk\r\nfarther down the wharf, find a packing-case and sit upon it, fold my\r\nhands, and am conscious that my head is growing more and more confused.\r\nI do not stir; I simply make no effort whatever to keep up any longer.\r\nI just sit there and stare at the _Cop\xc3\xa9goro_, the barque flying the\r\nRussian flag.\r\n\r\nI catch a glimpse of a man at the rail; the red lantern slung at the\r\nport shines down upon his head, and I get up and talk over to him. I\r\nhad no object in talking, as I did not expect to get a reply, either.\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n"Do you sail tonight, Captain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; in a short time," answered the man. He spoke Swedish.\r\n\r\n"Hem, I suppose you wouldn\'t happen to need a man?"\r\n\r\nI was at this instant utterly indifferent as to whether I was met by a\r\nrefusal or not; it was all the same to me what reply the man gave me,\r\nso I stood and waited for it.\r\n\r\n"Well, no," he replied; "unless it chanced to be a young fellow."\r\n\r\n"A young fellow!" I pulled myself together, took off my glasses\r\nfurtively and thrust them into my pocket, stepped up the gangway, and\r\nstrode on deck.\r\n\r\n"I have no experience," said I; "but I can do anything I am put to.\r\nWhere are you bound for?"\r\n\r\n"We are in ballast for Leith, to fetch coal for Cadiz."\r\n\r\n"All right," said I, forcing myself upon the man; "it\'s all the same to\r\nme where I go; I am prepared to do my work."\r\n\r\n"Have you never sailed before?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No; but as I tell you, put me to a task, and I\'ll do it. I am used to\r\na little of all sorts."\r\n\r\nHe bethought himself again.\r\n\r\nI had already taken keenly into my head that I was to sail this voyage,\r\nand I began to dread being hounded on shore again.\r\n\r\n"What do you think about it, Captain?" I asked at last. "I can really\r\ndo anything that turns up. What am I saying? I would be a poor sort of\r\nchap if I couldn\'t do a little more than just what I was put to. I can\r\ntake two watches at a stretch, if it comes to that. It would only do me\r\ngood, and I could hold out all the same."\r\n\r\n"All right, have a try at it. If it doesn\'t work, well, we can part in\r\nEngland."\r\n\r\n"Of course," I reply in my delight, and I repeated over again that we\r\ncould part in England if it didn\'t work.\r\n\r\nAnd he set me to work....\r\n\r\nOut in the fjord I dragged myself up once, wet with fever and\r\nexhaustion, and gazed landwards, and bade farewell for the present to\r\nthe town--to Christiania, where the windows gleamed so brightly in all\r\nthe homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HUNGER ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
