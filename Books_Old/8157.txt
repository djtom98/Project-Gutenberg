A few bushes hid\r\nthe curve of the line; the white vapour rose above them, evaporating in\r\nthe pale evening. A moment more and the last carriage would pass out of\r\nsight. The white gates swung forward slowly and closed over the line.\r\n\r\nAn oblong box painted reddish brown and tied with a rough rope lay on the\r\nseat beside her. The movement of her back and shoulders showed that the\r\nbundle she carried was a heavy one, the sharp bulging of the grey linen\r\ncloth that the weight was dead. She wore a faded yellow dress and a black\r\njacket too warm for the day. A girl of twenty, short, strongly built, with\r\nshort, strong arms. Her neck was plump, and her hair of so ordinary a\r\nbrown that it passed unnoticed. The nose was too thick, but the nostrils\r\nwere well formed. The eyes were grey, luminous, and veiled with dark\r\nlashes. But it was only when she laughed that her face lost its habitual\r\nexpression, which was somewhat sullen; then it flowed with bright humour.\r\nShe laughed now, showing a white line of almond-shaped teeth. The porter\r\nhad asked her if she were afraid to leave her bundle with her box. Both,\r\nhe said, would go up together in the donkey-cart. The donkey-cart came\r\ndown every evening to fetch parcels.... That was the way to Woodview,\r\nright up the lane. She could not miss it. She would find the lodge gate in\r\nthat clump of trees. The man lingered, for she was an attractive girl, but\r\nthe station-master called him away to remove some luggage.\r\n\r\nIt was a barren country. Once the sea had crawled at high tide half-way up\r\nthe sloping sides of those downs. It would do so now were it not for the\r\nshingle bank which its surging had thrown up along the coast. Between the\r\nshingle bank and the shore a weedy river flowed and the little town stood\r\nclamped together, its feet in the water\'s edge. There were decaying\r\nshipyards about the harbour, and wooden breakwaters stretched long, thin\r\narms seawards for ships that did not come. On the other side of the\r\nrailway apple blossoms showed above a white-washed wall; some market\r\ngardening was done in the low-lying fields, whence the downs rose in\r\ngradual ascents. On the first slope there was a fringe of trees. That was\r\nWoodview.\r\n\r\nThe girl gazed on this bleak country like one who saw it for the first\r\ntime. She saw without perceiving, for her mind was occupied with personal\r\nconsideration. She found it difficult to decide whether she should leave\r\nher bundle with her box. It hung heavy in her hand, and she did not know\r\nhow far Woodview was from the station. At the end of the platform the\r\nstation-master took her ticket, and she passed over the level-crossing\r\nstill undecided. The lane began with iron railings, laurels, and French\r\nwindows. She had been in service in such houses, and knew if she were\r\nengaged in any of them what her duties would be. But the life in Woodview\r\nwas a great dream, and she could not imagine herself accomplishing all\r\nthat would be required of her. There would be a butler, a footman, and a\r\npage; she would not mind the page--but the butler and footman, what would\r\nthey think? There would be an upper-housemaid and an under-housemaid, and\r\nperhaps a lady\'s-maid, and maybe that these ladies had been abroad with\r\nthe family. She had heard of France and Germany. Their conversation would,\r\nno doubt, turn on such subjects. Her silence would betray her. They would\r\nask her what situations she had been in, and when they learned the truth\r\nshe would have to leave disgraced. She had not sufficient money to pay for\r\na ticket to London. But what excuse could she give to Lady Elwin, who had\r\nrescued her from Mrs. Dunbar and got her the place of kitchen-maid at\r\nWoodview? She must not go back. Her father would curse her, and perhaps\r\nbeat her mother and her too. Ah! he would not dare to strike her again,\r\nand the girl\'s face flushed with shameful remembrance. And her little\r\nbrothers and sisters would cry if she came back. They had little enough to\r\neat as it was. Of course she must not go back. How silly of her to think\r\nof such a thing!\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and her face became as bright as the month: it was the first\r\nday of June. Still she would be glad when the first week was over. If she\r\nhad only a dress to wear in the afternoons! The old yellow thing on her\r\nback would never do. But one of her cotton prints was pretty fresh; she\r\nmust get a bit of red ribbon--that would make a difference. She had heard\r\nthat the housemaids in places like Woodview always changed their dresses\r\ntwice a day, and on Sundays went out in silk mantles and hats in the\r\nnewest fashion. As for the lady\'s-maid, she of course had all her\r\nmistress\'s clothes, and walked with the butler. What would such people\r\nthink of a little girl like her! Her heart sank at the thought, and she\r\nsighed, anticipating much bitterness and disappointment. Even when her\r\nfirst quarter\'s wages came due she would hardly be able to buy herself a\r\ndress: they would want the money at home. Her quarter\'s wages! A month\'s\r\nwages most like, for she\'d never be able to keep the place. No doubt all\r\nthose fields belonged to the Squire, and those great trees too; they must\r\nbe fine folk, quite as fine as Lady Elwin--finer, for she lived in a house\r\nlike those near the station.\r\n\r\nOn both sides of the straight road there were tall hedges, and the\r\nnursemaids lay in the wide shadows on the rich summer grass, their\r\nperambulators at a little distance. The hum of the town died out of the\r\near, and the girl continued to imagine the future she was about to enter\r\non with increasing distinctness. Looking across the fields she could see\r\ntwo houses, one in grey stone, the other in red brick with a gable covered\r\nwith ivy; and between them, lost in the north, the spire of a church. On\r\nquestioning a passer-by she learnt that the first house was the Rectory,\r\nthe second was Woodview Lodge. If that was the lodge, what must the house\r\nbe?\r\n\r\nTwo hundred yards further on the road branched, passing on either side of\r\na triangular clump of trees, entering the sea road; and under the leaves\r\nthe air was green and pleasant, and the lungs of the jaded town girl drew\r\nin a deep breath of health. Behind the plantation she found a large\r\nwhite-painted wooden gate. It opened into a handsome avenue, and the\r\ngatekeeper told her to keep straight on, and to turn to the left when she\r\ngot to the top. She had never seen anything like it before, and stopped\r\nto admire the uncouth arms of elms, like rafters above the roadway; pink\r\nclouds showed through, and the monotonous dove seemed the very heart of\r\nthe silence.\r\n\r\nHer doubts returned; she never would be able to keep the place. The avenue\r\nturned a little, and she came suddenly upon a young man leaning over the\r\npaling, smoking his pipe.\r\n\r\n"Please sir, is this the way to Woodview?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, right up through the stables, round to the left." Then, noticing the\r\nsturdily-built figure, yet graceful in its sturdiness, and the bright\r\ncheeks, he said, "You look pretty well done; that bundle is a heavy one,\r\nlet me hold it for you."\r\n\r\n"I am a bit tired," she said, leaning the bundle on the paling. "They told\r\nme at the station that the donkey-cart would bring up my box later on."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then you are the new kitchen-maid? What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Esther Waters."\r\n\r\n"My mother\'s the cook here; you\'ll have to mind your p\'s and q\'s or else\r\nyou\'ll be dropped on. The devil of a temper while it lasts, but not a bad\r\nsort if you don\'t put her out."\r\n\r\n"Are you in service here?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I hope to be afore long. I could have been two years ago, but\r\nmother did not like me to put on livery, and I don\'t know how I\'ll face\r\nher when I come running down to go out with the carriage."\r\n\r\n"Is the place vacant?" Esther asked, raising her eyes timidly, looking at\r\nhim sideways.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Jim Story got the sack about a week ago. When he had taken a drop\r\nhe\'d tell every blessed thing that was done in the stables. They\'d get him\r\ndown to the \'Red Lion\' for the purpose; of course the squire couldn\'t\r\nstand that."\r\n\r\n"And shall you take the place?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I\'m not going to spend my life carrying parcels up and down the\r\nKing\'s Road, Brighton, if I can squeeze in here. It isn\'t so much the\r\nberth that I care about, but the advantages, information fresh from the\r\nfountain-head. You won\'t catch me chattering over the bar at the \'Red\r\nLion\' and having every blessed word I say wired up to London and printed\r\nnext morning in all the papers."\r\n\r\nEsther wondered what he was talking about, and, looking at him, she saw a\r\nlow, narrow forehead, a small, round head, a long nose, a pointed chin,\r\nand rather hollow, bloodless cheeks. Notwithstanding the shallow chest, he\r\nwas powerfully built, the long arms could deal a swinging blow. The low\r\nforehead and the lustreless eyes told of a slight, unimaginative brain,\r\nbut regular features and a look of natural honesty made William Latch a\r\nman that ten men and eighteen women out of twenty would like.\r\n\r\n"I see you have got books in that bundle," he said at the end of a long\r\nsilence. "Fond of readin\'?"\r\n\r\n"They are mother\'s books," she replied, hastily. "I was afraid to leave\r\nthem at the station, for it would be easy for anyone to take one out, and\r\nI should not miss it until I undid the bundle."\r\n\r\n"Sarah Tucker--that\'s the upper-housemaid--will be after you to lend them\r\nto her. She is a wonderful reader. She has read every story that has come\r\nout in _Bow Bells_ for the last three years, and you can\'t puzzle her, try\r\nas you will. She knows all the names, can tell you which lord it was that\r\nsaved the girl from the carriage when the \'osses were tearing like mad\r\ntowards a precipice a \'undred feet deep, and all about the baronet for\r\nwhose sake the girl went out to drown herself in the moonlight, I \'aven\'t\r\nread the books mesel\', but Sarah and me are great pals,"\r\n\r\nEsther trembled lest he might ask her again if she were fond of reading;\r\nshe could not read. Noticing a change in the expression of her face, he\r\nconcluded that she was disappointed to hear that he liked Sarah and\r\nregretted his indiscretion.\r\n\r\n"Good friends, you know--no more. Sarah and me never hit it off; she will\r\nworry me with the stories she reads. I don\'t know what is your taste, but\r\nI likes something more practical; the little \'oss in there, he is more to\r\nmy taste." Fearing he might speak again of her books, she mustered up\r\ncourage and said--\r\n\r\n"They told me at the station that the donkey-cart would bring up my box."\r\n\r\n"The donkey-cart isn\'t going to the station to-night--you\'ll want your\r\nthings, to be sure. I\'ll see the coachman; perhaps he is going down with\r\nthe trap. But, golly! it has gone the half-hour. I shall catch it for\r\nkeeping you talking, and my mother has been expecting you for the last\r\nhour. She hasn\'t a soul to help her, and six people coming to dinner. You\r\nmust say the train was late."\r\n\r\n"Let us go, then," cried Esther. "Will you show me the way?"\r\n\r\nOver the iron gate which opened into the pleasure-ground, thick branches\r\nof evergreen oaks made an arch of foliage, and between the trees a glimpse\r\nwas caught of the angles and urns of an Italian house--distant about a\r\nhundred yards. A high brick wall separated the pleasure-ground from the\r\nstables, and as William and Esther turned to the left and walked up the\r\nroadway he explained that the numerous buildings were stables. They passed\r\nby many doors, hearing the trampling of horses and the rattling of chains.\r\nThen the roadway opened into a handsome yard overlooked by the house, the\r\nback premises of which had been lately rebuilt in red brick. There were\r\ngables and ornamental porches, and through the large kitchen windows the\r\nservants were seen passing to and fro. At the top of this yard was a gate.\r\nIt led into the park, and, like the other gate, was overhung by bunched\r\nevergreens. A string of horses came towards this gate, and William ran to\r\nopen it. The horses were clothed in grey cloth. They wore hoods, and\r\nEsther noticed the black round eyes looking through the eyelet holes. They\r\nwere ridden by small, ugly boys, who swung their little legs, and struck\r\nthem with ash plants when they reached their heads forward chawing at the\r\nbits. When William returned he said, "Look there, the third one; that\'s\r\nhe--that\'s Silver Braid."\r\n\r\nAn impatient knocking at the kitchen window interrupted his admiration,\r\nand William, turning quickly, said, "Mind you say the train was late;\r\ndon\'t say I kept you, or you\'ll get me into the devil of a pickle. This\r\nway." The door let into a wide passage covered with coconut matting. They\r\nwalked a few yards; the kitchen was the first door, and the handsome room\r\nshe found herself in did not conform to anything that Esther had seen or\r\nheard of kitchens. The range almost filled one end of the room, and on it\r\na dozen saucepans were simmering; the dresser reached to the ceiling, and\r\nwas covered with a multitude of plates and dishes. Esther thought how she\r\nmust strive to keep it in its present beautiful condition, and the elegant\r\nwhite-capped servants passing round the white table made her feel her own\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\n"This is the new kitchen-maid, mother."\r\n\r\n"Ah, is it indeed?" said Mrs. Latch looking up from the tray of tartlets\r\nwhich she had taken from the oven and was filling with jam. Esther noticed\r\nthe likeness that Mrs. Latch bore to her son. The hair was iron grey, and,\r\nas in William\'s face, the nose was the most prominent feature.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'ll tell me the train was late?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother, the train was a quarter of an hour late," William chimed in.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t ask you, you idle, lazy, good-for-nothing vagabond. I suppose it\r\nwas you who kept the girl all this time. Six people coming to dinner, and\r\nI\'ve been the whole day without a kitchen-maid. If Margaret Gale hadn\'t\r\ncome down to help me, I don\'t know where we should be; as it is, the\r\ndinner will be late."\r\n\r\nThe two housemaids, both in print dresses, stood listening. Esther\'s face\r\nclouded, and when Mrs. Latch told her to take her things off and set to\r\nand prepare the vegetables, so that she might see what she was made of,\r\nEsther did not answer at once. She turned away, saying under her breath,\r\n"I must change my dress, and my box has not come up from the station yet."\r\n\r\n"You can tuck your dress up, and Margaret Gale will lend you her apron."\r\n\r\nEsther hesitated.\r\n\r\n"What you\'ve got on don\'t look as if it could come to much damage. Come,\r\nnow, set to."\r\n\r\nThe housemaids burst into loud laughter, and then a sullen look of dogged\r\nobstinacy passed over and settled on Esther\'s face, even to the point of\r\nvisibly darkening the white and rose complexion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nA sloping roof formed one end of the room, and through a broad, single\r\npane the early sunlight fell across a wall papered with blue and white\r\nflowers. Print dresses hung over the door. On the wall were two\r\npictures--a girl with a basket of flowers, the coloured supplement of an\r\nillustrated newspaper, and an old and dilapidated last century print. On\r\nthe chimney-piece there were photographs of the Gale family in Sunday\r\nclothes, and the green vases that Sarah had given Margaret on her\r\nbirthday.\r\n\r\nAnd in a low, narrow iron bed, pushed close against the wall in the full\r\nglare of the sunlight, Esther lay staring half-awake, her eyes open but\r\nstill dim with dreams. She looked at the clock. It was not yet time to get\r\nup, and she raised her arms as if to cross them behind her head, but a\r\nsudden remembrance of yesterday arrested her movement, and a sudden shadow\r\nsettled on her face. She had refused to prepare the vegetables. She hadn\'t\r\nanswered, and the cook had turned her out of the kitchen. She had rushed\r\nfrom the house under the momentary sway of hope that she might succeed in\r\nwalking back to London; but William had overtaken her in the avenue, he\r\nhad expostulated with her, he had refused to allow her to pass. She had\r\nstriven to tear herself from him, and, failing, had burst into tears.\r\nHowever, he had been kind, and at last she had allowed him to lead her\r\nback, and all the time he had filled her ears with assurances that he\r\nwould make it all right with his mother. But Mrs. Latch had closed her\r\nkitchen against her, and she had had to go to her room. Even if they paid\r\nher fare back to London, how was she to face her mother? What would father\r\nsay? He would drive her from the house. But she had done nothing wrong.\r\nWhy did cook insult her?\r\n\r\nAs she pulled on her stockings she stopped and wondered if she should\r\nawake Margaret Gale. Margaret\'s bed stood in the shadow of the obliquely\r\nfalling wall; and she lay heavily, one arm thrown forward, her short,\r\nsquare face raised to the light. She slept so deeply that for a moment\r\nEsther felt afraid. Suddenly the eyes opened, and Margaret looked at her\r\nvaguely, as if out of eternity. Raising her hands to her eyes she said--\r\n\r\n"What time is it?"\r\n\r\n"It has just gone six."\r\n\r\n"Then there\'s plenty of time; we needn\'t be down before seven. You get on\r\nwith your dressing; there\'s no use in my getting up till you are\r\ndone--we\'d be tumbling over each other. This is no room to put two girls\r\nto sleep in--one glass not much bigger than your hand. You\'ll have to get\r\nyour box under your bed.... In my last place I had a beautiful room with a\r\nBrussels carpet, and a marble washstand. I wouldn\'t stay here three days\r\nif it weren\'t----" The girl laughed and turned lazily over.\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Now, isn\'t it a grubby little room to put two girls to sleep in? What was\r\nyour last place like?"\r\n\r\nEsther answered that she had hardly been in service before. Margaret was\r\ntoo much engrossed in her own thoughts to notice the curtness of the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"There\'s only one thing to be said for Woodview, and that is the eating;\r\nwe have anything we want, and we\'d have more than we want if it weren\'t\r\nfor the old cook: she must have her little bit out of everything and she\r\ncuts us short in our bacon in the morning. But that reminds me! You have\r\nset the cook against you; you\'ll have to bring her over to your side if\r\nyou want to remain here."\r\n\r\n"Why should I be asked to wash up the moment I came in the house, before\r\neven I had time to change my dress."\r\n\r\n"It was hard on you. She always gets as much as she can out of her\r\nkitchen-maid. But last night she was pressed, there was company to dinner.\r\nI\'d have lent you an apron, and the dress you had on wasn\'t of much\r\naccount."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t because a girl is poor----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I didn\'t mean that; I know well enough what it is to be hard up."\r\nMargaret clasped her stays across her plump figure and walked to the door\r\nfor her dress. She was a pretty girl, with a snub nose and large, clear\r\neyes. Her hair was lighter in tone than Esther\'s, and she had brushed it\r\nfrom her forehead so as to obviate the defect of her face, which was too\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nEsther was on her knees saying her prayers when Margaret turned to the\r\nlight to button her boots.\r\n\r\n"Well, I never!" she exclaimed. "Do you think prayers any good?"\r\n\r\nEsther looked up angrily.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to say anything against saying prayers, but I wouldn\'t\r\nbefore the others if I was you--they\'ll chaff dreadful, and call you\r\nCreeping Jesus."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Margaret, I hope they won\'t do anything so wicked. But I am afraid I\r\nshan\'t be long here, so it doesn\'t matter what they think of _me_."\r\n\r\nWhen they got downstairs they opened the windows and doors, and Margaret\r\ntook Esther round, showing her where the things were kept, and telling her\r\nfor how many she must lay the table. At that moment a number of boys and\r\nmen came clattering up the passage. They cried to Esther to hurry up,\r\ndeclaring that they were late. Esther did not know who they were, but she\r\nserved them as best she might. They breakfasted hastily and rushed away to\r\nthe stables; and they had not been long gone when the squire and his son\r\nArthur appeared in the yard. The Gaffer, as he was called, was a man of\r\nabout medium height. He wore breeches and gaiters, and in them his legs\r\nseemed grotesquely thick. His son was a narrow-chested, undersized young\r\nman, absurdly thin and hatchet-faced. He was also in breeches and gaiters,\r\nand to his boots were attached long-necked spurs. His pale yellow hair\r\ngave him a somewhat ludicrous appearance, as he stood talking to his\r\nfather, but the moment he prepared to get into the saddle he seemed quite\r\ndifferent. He rode a beautiful chestnut horse, a little too thin, Esther\r\nthought, and the ugly little boys were mounted on horses equally thin. The\r\nsquire rode a stout grey cob, and he watched the chestnut, and was also\r\ninterested in the brown horse that walked with its head in the air,\r\npulling at the smallest of all the boys, a little freckled, red-headed\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Silver Braid, the brown horse, the one that the Demon is riding;\r\nthe chestnut is Bayleaf, Ginger is riding him: he won the City and\r\nSuburban. Oh, we did have a fine time then, for we all had a bit on. The\r\nbetting was twenty to one, and I won twelve and six pence. Grover won\r\nthirty shillings. They say that John--that\'s the butler--won a little\r\nfortune; but he is so close no one knows what he has on. Cook wouldn\'t\r\nhave anything on; she says that betting is the curse of servants--you know\r\nwhat is said, that it was through betting that Mrs. Latch\'s husband got\r\ninto trouble. He was steward here, you know, in the late squire\'s time."\r\n\r\nThen Margaret told all she had heard on the subject. The late Mr. Latch\r\nhad been a confidential steward, and large sums of money were constantly\r\npassing through his hands for which he was never asked for any exact\r\naccount. Contrary to all expectation, Marksman was beaten for the Chester\r\nCup, and the squire\'s property was placed under the charge of a receiver.\r\nUnder the new management things were gone into more closely, and it was\r\nthen discovered that Mr. Latch\'s accounts were incapable of satisfactory\r\nexplanation. The defeat of Marksman had hit Mr. Latch as hard as it had\r\nhit the squire, and to pay his debts of honour he had to take from the\r\nmoney placed in his charge, confidently hoping to return it in a few\r\nmonths. The squire\'s misfortunes anticipated the realization of his\r\nintentions; proceedings were threatened, but were withdrawn when Mrs.\r\nLatch came forward with all her savings and volunteered to forego her\r\nwages for a term of years. Old Latch died soon after, some lucky bets set\r\nthe squire on his legs again, the matter was half forgotten, and in the\r\nnext generation it became the legend of the Latch family. But to Mrs.\r\nLatch it was an incurable grief, and to remove her son from influences\r\nwhich, in her opinion, had caused his father\'s death, Mrs. Latch had\r\nalways refused Mr. Barfield\'s offers to do something for William. It was\r\nagainst her will that he had been taught to ride; but to her great joy he\r\nsoon grew out of all possibility of becoming a jockey. She had then placed\r\nhim in an office in Brighton; but the young man\'s height and shape marked\r\nhim out for livery, and Mrs. Latch was pained when Mr. Barfield proposed\r\nit. "Why cannot they leave me my son?" she cried; for it seemed to her\r\nthat in that hateful cloth, buttons and cockade, he would be no more her\r\nson, and she could not forget what the Latches had been long ago.\r\n\r\n"I believe there\'s going to be a trial this morning," said Margaret;\r\n"Silver Braid was stripped--you noticed that--and Ginger always rides in\r\nthe trials."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what a trial is," said Esther. "They are not\r\ncarriage-horses, are they? They look too slight."\r\n\r\n"Carriage-horses, you ninny! Where have you been to all this while--can\'t\r\nyou see that they are race-horses?"\r\n\r\nEsther hung down her head and murmured something which Margaret didn\'t\r\ncatch.\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, I didn\'t know much about them when I came, but then\r\none never hears anything else here. And that reminds me--it is as much as\r\nyour place is worth to breathe one syllable about them horses; you must\r\nknow nothing when you are asked. That\'s what Jim Story got sacked\r\nfor--saying in the \'Red Lion\' that Valentine pulled up lame. We don\'t know\r\nhow it came to the Gaffer\'s ears. I believe that it was Mr. Leopold that\r\ntold; he finds out everything. But I was telling you how I learnt about\r\nthe race-horses. It was from Jim Story--Jim was my pal--Sarah is after\r\nWilliam, you know, the fellow who brought you into the kitchen last night.\r\nJim could never talk about anything but the \'osses. We\'d go every night\r\nand sit in the wood-shed, that\'s to say if it was wet; if it was fine we\'d\r\nwalk in the drove-way. I\'d have married Jim, I know I should, if he hadn\'t\r\nbeen sent away. That\'s the worst of being a servant. They sent Jim away\r\njust as if he was a dog. It was wrong of him to say the horse pulled up\r\nlame; I admit that, but they needn\'t have sent him away as they did."\r\n\r\nEsther was absorbed in the consideration of her own perilous position.\r\nWould they send her away at the end of the week, or that very afternoon?\r\nWould they give her a week\'s wages, or would they turn her out destitute\r\nto find her way back to London as best she might? What should she do if\r\nthey turned her out-of-doors that very afternoon? Walk back to London? She\r\ndid not know if that was possible. She did not know how far she had\r\ncome--a long distance, no doubt. She had seen woods, hills, rivers, and\r\ntowns flying past. Never would she be able to find her way back through\r\nthat endless country; besides, she could not carry her box on her back....\r\nWhat was she to do? Not a friend, not a penny in the world. Oh, why did\r\nsuch misfortune fall on a poor little girl who had never harmed anyone in\r\nthe world! And if they did give her her fare back--what then?... Should\r\nshe go home?... To her mother--to her poor mother, who would burst into\r\ntears, who would say, "Oh, my poor darling, I don\'t know what we shall do;\r\nyour father will never let you stay here."\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Latch had not spoken to her since she had come into the kitchen,\r\nand it seemed to Esther that she had looked round with the air of one\r\nanxious to discover something that might serve as a pretext for blame. She\r\nhad told Esther to make haste and lay the table afresh. Those who had gone\r\nwere the stable folk, and breakfast had now to be prepared for the other\r\nservants. The person in the dark green dress who spoke with her chin in\r\nthe air, whose nose had been pinched to purple just above the nostrils,\r\nwas Miss Grover, the lady\'s-maid. Grover addressed an occasional remark to\r\nSarah Tucker, a tall girl with a thin freckled face and dark-red hair. The\r\nbutler, who was not feeling well, did not appear at breakfast, and Esther\r\nwas sent to him with a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nThere were the plates to wash and the knives to clean, and when they were\r\ndone there were potatoes, cabbage, onions to prepare, saucepans to fill\r\nwith water, coal to fetch for the fire. She worked steadily without\r\nflagging, fearful of Mrs. Barfield, who would come down, no doubt, about\r\nten o\'clock to order dinner. The race-horses were coming through the\r\npaddock-gate; Margaret called to Mr. Randal, a little man, wizen, with a\r\nface sallow with frequent indigestions.\r\n\r\n"Well, do you think the Gaffer\'s satisfied?" said Margaret. John made no\r\narticulate reply, but he muttered something, and his manner showed that he\r\nstrongly deprecated all female interest in racing; and when Sarah and\r\nGrover came running down the passage and overwhelmed him with questions,\r\ncrowding around him, asking both together if Silver Braid had won his\r\ntrial, he testily pushed them aside, declaring that if he had a race-horse\r\nhe would not have a woman-servant in the place.... "A positive curse, this\r\nchatter, chatter. Won his trial, indeed! What business had a lot of female\r\nfolk----" The rest of John\'s sarcasm was lost in his shirt collar as he\r\nhurried away to his pantry, closing the door after him.\r\n\r\n"What a testy little man he is!" said Sarah; "he might have told us which\r\nwon. He has known the Gaffer so long that he knows the moment he looks at\r\nhim whether the gees are all right."\r\n\r\n"One can\'t speak to a chap in the lane that he doesn\'t know all about it\r\nnext day," said Margaret. "Peggy hates him; you know the way she skulks\r\nabout the back garden and up the \'ill so that she may meet young Johnson\r\nas he is ridin\' home."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have none of this scandal-mongering going on in my kitchen," said\r\nMrs. Latch. "Do you see that girl there? She can\'t get past to her\r\nscullery."\r\n\r\nEsther would have managed pretty well if it had not been for the\r\ndining-room lunch. Miss Mary was expecting some friends to play tennis\r\nwith her, and, besides the roast chicken, there were the cotelettes a la\r\nSoubise and a curry. There was for dessert a jelly and a blancmange, and\r\nEsther did not know where any of the things were, and a great deal of time\r\nwas wasted. "Don\'t you move, I might as well get it myself," said the old\r\nwoman. Mr. Randal, too, lost his temper, for she had no hot plates ready,\r\nnor could she distinguish between those that were to go to the dining-room\r\nand those that were to go to the servants\' hall. She understood, however,\r\nthat it would not be wise to give way to her feeling, and that the only\r\nway she could hope to retain her situation was by doing nothing to attract\r\nattention. She must learn to control that temper of hers--she must and\r\nwould. And it was in this frame of mind and with this determination that\r\nshe entered the servants\' hall.\r\n\r\nThere were not more than ten or eleven at dinner, but sitting close\r\ntogether they seemed more numerous, and quite half the number of faces\r\nthat looked up as she took her place next to Margaret Gale, were unknown\r\nto her. There were the four ugly little boys whom she had seen on the race\r\nhorses, but she did not recognize them at first, and nearly opposite,\r\nsitting next to the lady\'s-maid, was a small, sandy-haired man about\r\nforty: he was beginning to show signs of stoutness, and two little round\r\nwhiskers grew out of his pallid cheeks. Mr. Randal sat at the end of the\r\ntable helping the pudding. He addressed the sandy-haired man as Mr.\r\nSwindles; but Esther learnt afterwards his real name was Ward, and that he\r\nwas Mr. Barfield\'s head groom. She learnt, too, that "the Demon" was not\r\nthe real name of the little carroty-haired boy, and she looked at him in\r\namazement when he whispered in her ear that he would dearly love a real\r\ngo-in at that pudding, but that it was so fattening that he didn\'t ever\r\ndare to venture on more than a couple of sniffs. Seeing that the girl did\r\nnot understand, he added, by way of explanation, "You know that I must\r\nkeep under the six stone, and at times it becomes awful \'ard."\r\n\r\nEsther thought him a nice little fellow, and tried to persuade him to\r\nforego his resolution not to touch pudding, until Mr. Swindles told her to\r\ndesist. The attention of the whole table being thus drawn towards the boy,\r\nEsther was still further surprised at the admiration he seemed so easily\r\nto command and the important position he seemed to occupy, notwithstanding\r\nhis diminutive stature, whereas the bigger boys were treated with very\r\nlittle consideration. The long-nosed lad, with weak eyes and sloping\r\nshoulders, who sat on the other side of the table on Mr. Swindles\' left,\r\nwas everybody\'s laughing-stock, especially Mr. Swindles\', who did not\r\ncease to poke fun at him. Mr. Swindles was now telling poor Jim\'s\r\nmisadventures with the Gaffer.\r\n\r\n"But why do you call him Mr. Leopold when his name is Mr. Randal?" Esther\r\nventured to inquire of the Demon.\r\n\r\n"On account of Leopold Rothschild," said the Demon; "he\'s pretty near as\r\nrich, if the truth was known--won a pile over the City and Sub. Pity you\r\nweren\'t there; might have had a bit on."\r\n\r\n"I have never seen the City," Esther replied innocently.\r\n\r\n"Never seen the City and Sub!... I was up, had a lot in hand, so I came\r\naway from my \'orses the moment I got into the dip. The Tinman nearly\r\ncaught me on the post--came with a terrific rush; he is just hawful, that\r\nTinman is. I did catch it from the Gaffer--he did give it me."\r\n\r\nThe plates of all the boys except the Demon\'s were now filled with\r\nbeefsteak pudding, potatoes, and greens, likewise Esther\'s. Mr. Leopold,\r\nMr. Swindles, the housemaid, and the cook dined off the leg of mutton, a\r\nsmall slice of which was sent to the Demon. "That for a dinner!" and as he\r\ntook up his knife and fork and cut a small piece of his one slice, he\r\nsaid, "I suppose you never had to reduce yourself three pounds; girls\r\nnever have. I do run to flesh so, you wouldn\'t believe it. If I don\'t walk\r\nto Portslade and back every second day, I go up three or four pounds. Then\r\nthere\'s nothing for it but the physic, and that\'s what settles me. Can you\r\ntake physic?"\r\n\r\n"I took three Beecham\'s pills once."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s nothing. Can you take castor-oil?"\r\n\r\nEsther looked in amazement at the little boy at her side. Swindles had\r\noverheard the question and burst into a roar of laughter. Everyone wanted\r\nto know what the joke was, and, feeling they were poking fun at her,\r\nEsther refused to answer.\r\n\r\nThe first helpings of pudding or mutton had taken the edge off their\r\nappetites, and before sending their plates for more they leaned over the\r\ntable listening and laughing open-mouthed. It was a bare room, lit with\r\none window, against which Mrs. Latch\'s austere figure appeared in\r\ndark-grey silhouette. The window looked on one of the little back courts\r\nand tiled ways which had been built at the back of the house; and the\r\nshadowed northern light softened the listening faces with grey tints.\r\n\r\n"You know," said Mr. Swindles, glancing at Jim as if to assure himself\r\nthat the boy was there and unable to escape from the hooks of his sarcasm,\r\n"how fast the Gaffer talks, and how he hates to be asked to repeat his\r\nwords. Knowing this, Jim always says, \'Yes, sir; yes, sir.\' \'Now do you\r\nquite understand?\' says the Gaffer. \'Yes, sir; yes, sir,\' replies Jim, not\r\nhaving understood one word of what was said; but relying on us to put him\r\nright. \'Now what did he say I was to do?\' says Jim, the moment the Gaffer\r\nis out of hearing. But this morning we were on ahead, and the Gaffer had\r\nJim all to himself. As usual he says, \'Now do you quite understand?\' and\r\nas usual Jim says, \'Yes, sir; yes, sir.\' Suspecting that Jim had not\r\nunderstood, I said when he joined us, \'Now if you are not sure what he\r\nsaid you had better go back and ask him,\' but Jim declared that he had\r\nperfectly understood. \'And what did he tell you to do?\' said I. \'He told\r\nme,\' says Jim, \'to bring the colt along and finish up close by where he\r\nwould be standing at the end of the track.\' I thought it rather odd to\r\nsend Firefly such a stiff gallop as all that, but Jim was certain that he\r\nhad heard right. And off they went, beginning the other side of Southwick\r\nHill. I saw the Gaffer with his arms in the air, and don\'t know now what\r\nhe said. Jim will tell you. He did give it you, didn\'t he, you old\r\nWoolgatherer?" said Mr. Swindles, slapping the boy on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n"You may laugh as much as you please, but I\'m sure he did tell me to come\r\nalong three-quarter speed after passing the barn," replied Jim, and to\r\nchange the conversation he asked Mr. Leopold for some more pudding, and\r\nthe Demon\'s hungry eyes watched the last portion being placed on the\r\nWoolgatherer\'s plate. Noticing that Esther drank no beer, he exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"Well, I never; to see yer eat and drink one would think that it was you\r\nwho was a-wasting to ride the crack at Goodwood."\r\n\r\nThe remark was received with laughter, and, excited by his success, the\r\nDemon threw his arms round Esther, and seizing her hands, said, "Now yer a\r\njest beginning to get through yer \'osses, and when you get on a level----"\r\nBut the Demon, in his hungry merriment, had bestowed no thought of finding\r\na temper in such a staid little girl, and a sound box on the ear threw him\r\nbackwards into his seat surprised and howling. "Yer nasty thing!" he\r\nblubbered out. "Couldn\'t you see it was only a joke?" But passion was hot\r\nin Esther. She had understood no word that had been said since she had sat\r\ndown to dinner, and, conscious of her poverty and her ignorance, she\r\nimagined that a great deal of the Demon\'s conversation had been directed\r\nagainst her; and, choking with indignation, she only heard indistinctly\r\nthe reproaches with which the other little boys covered her--"nasty,\r\ndirty, ill-tempered thing, scullery-maid," etc.; nor did she understand\r\ntheir whispered plans to duck her when she passed the stables. All looked\r\na little askance, especially Grover and Mr. Leopold. Margaret said--\r\n\r\n"That will teach these impertinent little jockey-boys that the servants\'\r\nhall is not the harness-room; they oughtn\'t to be admitted here at all."\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold nodded, and told the Demon to leave off blubbering. "You can\'t\r\nbe so much hurt as all that. Come, wipe your eyes and have a piece of\r\ncurrant tart, or leave the room. I want to hear from Mr. Swindles an\r\naccount of the trial. We know that Silver Braid won, but we haven\'t heard\r\nhow he won nor yet what the weights were."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Swindles, "what I makes out is this. I was riding within\r\na pound or two of nine stone, and The Rake is, as you know, seven pounds,\r\nno more, worse than Bayleaf. Ginger rides usually as near as possible my\r\nweight--we\'ll say he was riding nine two--I think he could manage\r\nthat--and the Demon, we know, he is now riding over the six stone; in his\r\nordinary clothes he rides six seven."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, but how do we know that there was any lead to speak of in the\r\nDemon\'s saddle-cloth?"\r\n\r\n"The Demon says there wasn\'t above a stone. Don\'t you, Demon?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know nothing! I\'m not going to stand being clouted by the\r\nkitchen-maid."\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up, or leave the room," said Mr. Leopold; "we don\'t want to hear\r\nany more about that."\r\n\r\n"I started making the running according to orders. Ginger was within\r\nthree-quarters of a length of me, being pulled out of the saddle. The\r\nGaffer was standing at the three-quarters of the mile, and there Ginger\r\nwon fairly easily, but they went on to the mile--them were the orders--and\r\nthere the Demon won by half a length, that is to say if Ginger wasn\'t\r\na-kidding of him."\r\n\r\n"A-kidding of me!" said the Demon. "When we was a hundred yards from \'ome\r\nI steadied without his noticing me, and then I landed in the last fifty\r\nyards by half a length. Ginger can\'t ride much better than any other\r\ngentleman."\r\n\r\n"Yer see," said Mr. Swindles, "he\'d sooner have a box on the ear from the\r\nkitchen-maid than be told a gentleman could kid him at a finish. He\r\nwouldn\'t mind if it was the Tinman, eh, Demon?"\r\n\r\n"We know," said Mr. Leopold, "that Bayleaf can get the mile; there must\r\nhave been a lot of weight between them. Besides, I should think that the\r\ntrial was at the three-quarters of the mile. The mile was so much kid."\r\n\r\n"I should say," replied Mr. Swindles, "that the \'orses were tried at\r\ntwenty-one pounds, and if Silver Braid can beat Bayleaf at that weight,\r\nhe\'ll take a deal of beating at Goodwood."\r\n\r\nAnd leaning forward, their arms on the table, with large pieces of cheese\r\nat the end of their knives, the maid-servants and the jockey listened\r\nwhile Mr. Leopold and Mr. Swindles discussed the chances the stable had of\r\npulling off the Stewards\' Cup with Silver Braid.\r\n\r\n"But he will always keep on trying them," said Mr. Swindles, "and what\'s\r\nthe use, says I, of trying \'orses that are no more than \'alf fit? And them\r\ndowns is just rotten with \'orse watchers; it has just come to this, that\r\nyou can\'t comb out an \'orse\'s mane without seeing it in the papers the day\r\nafter. If I had my way with them gentry----" Mr. Swindles finished his\r\nbeer at a gulp, and he put down his glass as firmly as he desired to put\r\ndown the horse watchers. At the end of a long silence Mr. Leopold said--\r\n\r\n"Come into my pantry and smoke a pipe. Mr. Arthur will be down presently.\r\nPerhaps he\'ll tell us what weight he was riding this morning."\r\n\r\n"Cunning old bird," said Mr. Swindles, as he rose from the table and wiped\r\nhis shaven lips with the back of his hand; "and you\'d have us believe that\r\nyou didn\'t know, would you? You\'d have us believe, would you, that the\r\nGaffer don\'t tell you everything when you bring up his hot water in the\r\nmorning, would you?"\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold laughed under his breath, and looking mysterious and very\r\nrat-like he led the way to his pantry. Esther watched them in strange\r\ntrouble of soul. She had heard of racecourses as shameful places where men\r\nwere led to their ruin, and betting she had always understood to be\r\nsinful, but in this house no one seemed to think of anything else. It was\r\nno place for a Christian girl.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s have some more of the story," Margaret said. "You\'ve got the new\r\nnumber. The last piece was where he is going to ask the opera-singer to\r\nrun away with him."\r\n\r\nSarah took an illustrated journal out of her pocket and began to read\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nEsther was one of the Plymouth Brethren. In their chapel, if the house in\r\nwhich they met could be called a chapel, there were neither pictured\r\nstories of saints, nor vestments, nor music, nor even imaginative\r\nstimulant in the shape of written prayers. Her knowledge of life was\r\nstrictly limited to her experience of life; she knew no drama of passion\r\nexcept that which the Gospels relate: this story in the _Family Reader_\r\nwas the first representation of life she had met with, and its humanity\r\nthrilled her like the first idol set up for worship. The actress told\r\nNorris that she loved him. They were on a balcony, the sky was blue, the\r\nmoon was shining, the warm scent of the mignonette came up from the garden\r\nbelow, the man was in evening dress with diamond shirt studs, the\r\nactress\'s arm was large and white. They had loved each other for years.\r\nThe strangest events had happened for the purpose of bringing them\r\ntogether, and, fascinated against her will, Esther could not but listen.\r\nBut at the end of the chapter the racial instinct forced reproval from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"I am sure it is wicked to read such tales."\r\n\r\nSarah looked at her in mute astonishment. Grover said--\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t be here at all. Can\'t Mrs. Latch find nothing for you to do\r\nin the scullery?"\r\n\r\n"Then," said Sarah, awaking to a sense of the situation, "I suppose that\r\nwhere you come from you were not so much as allowed to read a tale;\r\n... dirty little chapel-going folk!"\r\n\r\nThe incident might have closed with this reproval had not Margaret\r\nvolunteered the information that Esther\'s box was full of books.\r\n\r\n"I should like to see them books," said Sarah. "I\'ll be bound that they\r\nare only prayer-books."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind what you say to me, but you shall not insult my religion."\r\n\r\n"Insult your religion! I said you never had read a book in your life\r\nunless it was a prayer-book."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t use prayer-books."\r\n\r\n"Then what books have you read?"\r\n\r\nEsther hesitated, her manner betrayed her, and, suspecting the truth,\r\nSarah said:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that you can read at all. Come, I\'ll bet you twopence\r\nthat you can\'t read the first five lines of my story."\r\n\r\nEsther pushed the paper from her and walked out of the room in a tumult of\r\ngrief and humiliation. Woodview and all belonging to it had grown\r\nunbearable, and heedless to what complaint the cook might make against her\r\nshe ran upstairs and shut herself into her room. She asked why they should\r\ntake pleasure in torturing her. It was not her fault if she did not know\r\nhow to read. There were the books she loved for her mother\'s sake, the\r\nbooks that had brought such disgrace upon her. Even the names she could\r\nnot read, and the shame of her ignorance lay upon her heavier than a\r\nweight of lead. "Peter Parley\'s Annual," "Sunny Memories of Foreign\r\nLands," "Children of the Abbey," "Uncle Tom\'s Cabin," Lamb\'s "Tales of\r\nShakespeare\'s Plays," a Cooking Book, "Roda\'s Mission of Love," the Holy\r\nBible and the Common Prayer Book.\r\n\r\nShe turned them over, wondering what were the mysteries that this print\r\nheld from her. It was to her mysterious as the stars.\r\n\r\nEsther Waters came from Barnstaple. She had been brought up in the\r\nstrictness of the Plymouth Brethren, and her earliest memories were of\r\nprayers, of narrow, peaceful family life. This early life had lasted till\r\nshe was ten years old. Then her father died. He had been a house-painter,\r\nbut in early youth he had been led into intemperance by some wild\r\ncompanions. He was often not in a fit state to go to work, and one day the\r\nfumes of the beer he had drunk overpowered him as he sat in the strong\r\nsunlight on his scaffolding. In the hospital he called upon God to relieve\r\nhim of his suffering; then the Brethren said, "You never thought of God\r\nbefore. Be patient, your health is coming back; it is a present from God;\r\nyou would like to know Him and thank Him from the bottom of your heart?"\r\n\r\nJohn Waters\' heart was touched. He became one of the Brethren, renouncing\r\nthose companions who refused to follow into the glory of God. His\r\nconversion and subsequent grace won for him the sympathies of Mary\r\nThornby. But Mary\'s father would not consent to the marriage unless John\r\nabandoned his dangerous trade of house-painter. John Waters consented to\r\ndo this, and old James Thornby, who had made a competence in the curiosity\r\nline, offered to make over his shop to the young couple on certain\r\nconditions; these conditions were accepted, and under his father-in-law\'s\r\ndirection John drove a successful trade in old glass, old jewellery, and\r\nold furniture.\r\n\r\nThe Brethren liked not this trade, and they often came to John to speak\r\nwith him on the subject, and their words were----\r\n\r\n"Of course this is between you and the Lord, but these things" (pointing\r\nto the old glass and jewellery) "often are but snares for the feet, and\r\nlead weaker brethren into temptation. Of course, it is between you and the\r\nLord."\r\n\r\nSo John Waters was tormented with scruples concerning the righteousness of\r\nhis trade, but his wife\'s gentle voice and eyes, and the limitations that\r\nhis accident, from which he had never wholly recovered, had set upon his\r\nlife, overruled his scruples, and he remained until he died a dealer in\r\nartistic ware, eliminating, however, from his dealings those things to\r\nwhich the Brethren most strongly objected.\r\n\r\nWhen he died his widow strove to carry on the business, but her father,\r\nwho was now a confirmed invalid, could not help her. In the following year\r\nshe lost both her parents. Many changes were taking place in Barnstaple,\r\nnew houses were being built, a much larger and finer shop had been opened\r\nin the more prosperous end of the town, and Mrs. Waters found herself\r\nobliged to sell her business for almost nothing, and marry again. Children\r\nwere born of this second marriage in rapid succession, the cradle was\r\nnever empty, and Esther was spoken of as the little nurse.\r\n\r\nHer great solicitude was for her poor mother, who had lost her health,\r\nwhose blood was impoverished by constant child-bearing. Mother and\r\ndaughter were seen in the evenings, one with a baby at her breast, the\r\nother with an eighteen months old child in her arms. Esther did not dare\r\nleave her mother, and to protect her she gave up school, and this was why\r\nshe had never learnt how to read.\r\n\r\nOne of the many causes of quarrel between Mrs. Saunders and her husband\r\nwas her attendance at prayer-meetings when he said she should be at home\r\nminding her children. He used to accuse her of carrying on with the\r\nScripture-readers, and to punish her he would say, "This week I\'ll spend\r\nfive bob more in the public--that\'ll teach you, if beating won\'t, that I\r\ndon\'t want none of your hypocritical folk hanging round my place." So it\r\nbefell the Saunders family to have little to eat; and Esther often\r\nwondered how she should get a bit of dinner for her sick mother and her\r\nhungry little brothers and sisters. Once they passed nearly thirty hours\r\nwithout food. She called them round her, and knelt down amid them: they\r\nprayed that God might help them; and their prayers were answered, for at\r\nhalf-past twelve a Scripture lady came in with flowers in her hands. She\r\nasked Mrs. Saunders how her appetite was. Mrs. Saunders answered that it\r\nwas more than she could afford, for there was nothing to eat in the house.\r\nThen the Scripture lady gave them eighteen pence, and they all knelt down\r\nand thanked God together.\r\n\r\nBut although Saunders spent a great deal of his money in the public-house,\r\nhe rarely got drunk and always kept his employment. He was a painter of\r\nengines, a first-rate hand, earning good money, from twenty-five to thirty\r\nshillings a week. He was a proud man, but so avaricious that he stopped at\r\nnothing to get money. He was an ardent politician, yet he would sell his\r\nvote to the highest bidder, and when Esther was seventeen he compelled her\r\nto take service regardless of the character of the people or of what the\r\nplace was like. They had left Barnstaple many months, and were now living\r\nin a little street off the Vauxhall Bridge Road, near the factory where\r\nSaunders worked; and since they had been in London Esther had been\r\nconstantly in service. Why should he keep her? She wasn\'t one of his\r\nchildren, he had quite enough of his own. Sometimes of an evening, when\r\nEsther could escape from her drudgery for a few minutes, her mother would\r\nstep round, and mother and daughter, wrapped in the same shawl, would walk\r\nto and fro telling each other their troubles, just as in old times. But\r\nthese moments were few. In grimy lodging-houses she worked from early\r\nmorning till late at night, scrubbing grates, preparing bacon and eggs,\r\ncooking chops, and making beds. She had become one of those London girls\r\nto whom rest, not to say pleasure, is unknown, who if they should sit down\r\nfor a few moments hear the mistress\'s voice, "Now, Eliza, have you nothing\r\nto do, that you are sitting there idle?" Two of her mistresses, one after\r\nthe other, had been sold up, and now all the rooms in the neighbourhood\r\nwere unlet, no one wanted a "slavey," and Esther was obliged to return\r\nhome. It was on the last of these occasions that her father had taken her\r\nby the shoulders, saying----\r\n\r\n"No lodging-houses that want a slavey? I\'ll see about that. Tell me,\r\nfirst, have you been to 78?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but another girl was before me, and the place was taken when I\r\narrived."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what you were doing that you didn\'t get there sooner; dangling\r\nabout after your mother, I suppose! Well, what about 27 in the Crescent?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t go there--that Mrs. Dunbar is a bad woman."\r\n\r\n"Bad woman! Who are you, I should like to know, that you can take a lady\'s\r\ncharacter away? Who told you she was a bad woman? One of the\r\nScripture-readers, I suppose! I knew it was. Well, then, just get out of\r\nmy house."\r\n\r\n"Where shall I go?"\r\n\r\n"Go to hell for all I care. Do you hear me? Get out!"\r\n\r\nEsther did not move--words, and then blows. Esther\'s escape from her\r\nstepfather seemed a miracle, and his anger was only appeased by Mrs.\r\nSaunders promising that Esther should accept the situation.\r\n\r\n"Only for a little while. Perhaps Mrs. Dunbar is a better woman than you\r\nthink for. For my sake, dearie. If you don\'t he may kill you and me too."\r\n\r\nEsther looked at her one moment, then she said, "Very well, mother,\r\nto-morrow I\'ll take the place."\r\n\r\nNo longer was the girl starved, no longer was she made to drudge till the\r\nthought of another day was a despair and a terror. And seeing that she was\r\na good girl, Mrs. Dunbar respected her scruples. Indeed, she was very\r\nkind, and Esther soon learnt to like her, and, through her affection for\r\nher, to think less of the life she led. A dangerous point is this in a\r\nyoung girl\'s life. Esther was young, and pretty, and weary, and out of\r\nhealth; and it was at this critical moment that Lady Elwin, who, while\r\nvisiting, had heard her story, promised Mrs. Saunders to find Esther\r\nanother place. And to obviate all difficulties about references and\r\ncharacter, Lady Elwin proposed to take Esther as her own servant for a\r\nsufficient while to justify her in recommending her.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as she turned over her books--the books she could not read--her\r\npure and passionate mind was filled with the story of her life. She\r\nremembered her poor little brothers and sisters and her dear mother, and\r\nthat tyrant revenging himself upon them because of the little she might\r\neat and drink. No, she must bear with all insults and scorn, and forget\r\nthat they thought her as dirt under their feet. But what were such\r\nsufferings compared to those she would endure were she to return home? In\r\ntruth they were as nothing. And yet the girl longed to leave Woodview. She\r\nhad never been out of sight of home before. Amid the violences of her\r\nstepfather there had always been her mother and the meeting-house. In\r\nWoodview there was nothing, only Margaret, who had come to console and\r\npersuade her to come downstairs. The resolution she had to call out of her\r\nsoul to do this exhausted her, and she went downstairs heedless of what\r\nanyone might say.\r\n\r\nTwo and three days passed without anything occurring that might suggest\r\nthat the Fates were for or against her remaining. Mrs. Barfield continued\r\nto be indisposed, but at the end of the week Esther, while she was at work\r\nin the scullery, heard a new voice speaking with Mrs. Latch. This must be\r\nMrs. Barfield. She heard Mrs. Latch tell the story of her refusal to go to\r\nwork the evening she arrived. But Mrs. Barfield told her that she would\r\nlisten to no further complaints; this was the third kitchen-maid in four\r\nmonths, and Mrs. Latch must make up her mind to bear with the faults and\r\nfailings of this last one, whatever they were. Then Mrs. Barfield called\r\nEsther; and when she entered the kitchen she found herself face to face\r\nwith a little red-haired woman, with a pretty, pointed face.\r\n\r\n"I hear, Waters--that is your name, I think--that you refused to obey\r\ncook, and walked out of the kitchen the night you arrived."\r\n\r\n"I said, ma\'am, that I would wait till my box came up from the station, so\r\nthat I might change my dress. Mrs. Latch said my dress didn\'t matter, but\r\nwhen one is poor and hasn\'t many dresses----"\r\n\r\n"Are you short of clothes, then?"\r\n\r\n"I have not many, ma\'am, and the dress I had on the day I came----"\r\n\r\n"Never mind about that. Tell me, are you short of clothes?--for if you are\r\nI daresay my daughter might find you something--you are about the same\r\nheight--with a little alteration----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma\'am, you are too good. I shall be most grateful. But I think I\r\nshall be able to manage till my first quarter\'s wages come to me."\r\n\r\nAnd the scowl upon Mrs. Latch\'s long face did not kill the pleasure which\r\nthe little interview with that kind, sweet woman, Mrs. Barfield, had\r\ncreated in her. She moved about her work, happy at heart, singing to\r\nherself as she washed the vegetables. Even Mrs. Latch\'s harshness didn\'t\r\ntrouble her much. She felt it to be a manner under which there might be a\r\nkind heart, and she hoped by her willingness to work to gain at least the\r\ncook\'s toleration. Margaret suggested that Esther should give up her beer.\r\nA solid pint extra a day could not fail, she said, to win the old woman\'s\r\ngratitude, and perhaps induce her to teach Esther how to make pastry and\r\njellies.\r\n\r\nTrue that Margaret joined in the common laugh and jeer that the knowledge\r\nthat Esther said her prayers morning and evening inspired. She sometimes\r\nunited with Grover and Sarah in perplexing Esther with questions regarding\r\nher previous situations, but her hostilities were, on the whole, gentle,\r\nand Esther felt that this almost neutral position was the best that\r\nMargaret could have adopted. She defended her without seeming to do so,\r\nand seemed genuinely fond of her, helping her sometimes even with her\r\nwork, which Mrs. Latch made as heavy as possible. But Esther was now\r\ndetermined to put up with every task they might impose upon her; she would\r\ngive them no excuse for sending her away; she would remain at Woodview\r\nuntil she had learned sufficient cooking to enable her to get another\r\nplace. But Mrs. Latch had the power to thwart her in this. Before\r\nbeginning on her jellies and gravies Mrs. Latch was sure to find some\r\nsaucepans that had not been sufficiently cleaned with white sand, and, if\r\nher search proved abortive, she would send Esther upstairs to scrub out\r\nher bedroom.\r\n\r\n"I cannot think why she is so down upon me," Esther often said to\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\n"She isn\'t more down upon you than she was on the others. You needn\'t\r\nexpect to learn any cooking from her; her plan has always been to take\r\ncare that she shall not be supplanted by any of her kitchen-maids. But I\r\ndon\'t see why she should be always sending you upstairs to clean out her\r\nbedroom. If Grover wasn\'t so stand-offish, we might tell her about it, and\r\nshe could tell the Saint--that\'s what we call the missis; the Saint would\r\nsoon put a stop to all that nonsense. I will say that for the Saint, she\r\ndo like everyone to have fair play."\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield, or the Saint, as she was called, belonged, like Esther, to\r\nthe sect known as the Plymouth Brethren. She was the daughter of one of\r\nthe farmers on the estate--a very old man called Elliot. He had spent his\r\nlife on his barren down farm, becoming intimate with no one, driving hard\r\nbargains with all, especially the squire and the poor flint-pickers. He\r\ncould be seen still on the hill-sides, his long black coat buttoned\r\nstrictly about him, his soft felt hat crushed over the thin, grey face.\r\nPretty Fanny Elliot had won the squire\'s heart as he rode across the down.\r\nDo you not see the shy figure of the Puritan maiden tripping through the\r\ngorse, hastening the hoofs of the squire\'s cob? And, furnished with some\r\npretext of estate business, he often rode to the farm that lay under the\r\nshaws at the end of the coombe. The squire had to promise to become one of\r\nthe Brethren and he had to promise never to bet again, before Fanny Elliot\r\nagreed to become Mrs. Barfield. The ambitious members of the Barfield\r\nfamily declared that the marriage was social ruin, but more dispassionate\r\ncritics called it a very suitable match; for it was not forgotten that\r\nthree generations ago the Barfields were livery-stable keepers; they had\r\nrisen in the late squire\'s time to the level of county families, and the\r\nenvious were now saying that the Barfield family was sinking back whence\r\nit came.\r\n\r\nHe was faithful to his promises for a time. Race-horses disappeared from\r\nthe Woodview stables. It was not until after the birth of both his\r\nchildren that he entered one of his hunters in the hunt steeplechase. Soon\r\nafter the racing stable was again in full swing at Woodview. Tears there\r\nwere, and some family disunion, but time extorts concessions from all of\r\nus. Mrs. Barfield had ceased to quarrel with her husband on the subject of\r\nhis racehorses, and he in his turn did not attempt to restrict her in the\r\nexercise of her religion. She attended prayer-meetings when her soul moved\r\nher, and read the Scriptures when and where she pleased.\r\n\r\nIt was one of her practices to have the women-servants for half-an-hour\r\nevery Sunday afternoon in the library, and instruct them in the life of\r\nChrist. Mrs. Barfield\'s goodness was even as a light upon her little oval\r\nface--reddish hair growing thin at the parting and smoothed back above the\r\nears, as in an old engraving. Although nearly fifty, her figure was slight\r\nas a young girl\'s. Esther was attracted by the magnetism of racial and\r\nreligious affinities; and when their eyes met at prayers there was\r\nacknowledgment of religious kinship. A glow of happiness filled Esther\'s\r\nsoul, for she knew she was no longer wholly among strangers; she knew they\r\nwere united--she and her mistress--under the sweet dominion of Christ. To\r\nlook at Mrs. Barfield filled her, somehow, with recollections of her pious\r\nchildhood; she saw herself in the old shop, moving again in an atmosphere\r\nof prayer, listening to the beautiful story, in the annunciation of which\r\nher life had grown up. She answered her mistress\'s questions in sweet\r\nlight-heartedness of spirit, pleasing her with her knowledge of the Holy\r\nBook. But in turn the servants had begun to read verses aloud from the New\r\nTestament, and Esther saw that her secret would be torn from her. Sarah\r\nhad read a verse, and Mrs. Barfield had explained it, and now Margaret was\r\nreading. Esther listened, thinking if she might plead illness and escape\r\nfrom the room; but she could not summon sufficient presence of mind, and\r\nwhile she was still agitated and debating with herself, Mrs. Barfield\r\ncalled to her to continue. She hung down her head, suffocated with the\r\nshame of the exposure, and when Mrs. Barfield told her again to continue\r\nthe reading Esther shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Can you not read, Esther?" she heard a kind voice saying; and the sound\r\nof this voice loosed the feelings long pent up, and the girl, giving way\r\nutterly, burst into passionate weeping. She was alone with her suffering,\r\nconscious of nothing else, until a kind hand led her from the room, and\r\nthis hand soothed away the bitterness of the tittering which reached her\r\nears as the door closed. It was hard to persuade her to speak, but even\r\nthe first words showed that there was more on the girl\'s heart than could\r\nbe told in a few minutes. Mrs. Barfield determined to take the matter at\r\nonce in hand; she dismissed the other servants and returned to the library\r\nwith Esther, and in that dim room of little green sofas, bookless shelves,\r\nand bird-cages, the women--mistress and maid--sealed the bond of a\r\nfriendship which was to last for life.\r\n\r\nEsther told her mistress everything--the work that Mrs. Latch required of\r\nher, the persecution she received from the other servants, principally\r\nbecause of her religion. In the course of the narrative allusion was made\r\nto the race-horses, and Esther saw on Mrs. Barfield\'s face a look of\r\ngrief, and it was clear to what cause Mrs. Barfield attributed the\r\ndemoralisation of her household.\r\n\r\n"I will teach you how to read, Esther. Every Sunday after our Bible\r\ninstruction you shall remain when the others have left for half-an-hour.\r\nIt is not difficult; you will soon learn."\r\n\r\nHenceforth, every Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Barfield devoted half-an-hour to\r\nthe instruction of her kitchen-maid. These half-hours were bright spots of\r\nhappiness in the serving-girl\'s weeks of work--happiness that had been and\r\nwould be again. But although possessing a clear intelligence, Esther did\r\nnot make much progress, nor did her diligence seem to help her. Mrs.\r\nBarfield was puzzled by her pupil\'s slowness; she ascribed it to her own\r\ninaptitude to teach and the little time for lessons. Esther\'s\r\npowerlessness to put syllables together, to grasp the meaning of words,\r\nwas very marked. Strange it was, no doubt, but all that concerned the\r\nprinted page seemed to embarrass and elude her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEsther\'s position in Woodview was now assured, and her fellow-servants\r\nrecognised the fact, though they liked her none the better for it. Mrs.\r\nLatch still did what she could to prevent her from learning her trade, but\r\nshe no longer attempted to overburden her with work. Of Mr. Leopold she\r\nsaw almost as little as she did of the people upstairs. He passed along\r\nthe passages or remained shut up in his pantry. Ginger used to go there to\r\nsmoke; and when the door stood ajar Esther saw his narrow person seated on\r\nthe edge of the table, his leg swinging. Among the pantry people Mr.\r\nLeopold\'s erudition was a constant subject of admiration. His\r\nreminiscences of the races of thirty years ago were full of interest; he\r\nhad seen the great horses whose names live in the stud-book, the horses\r\nthe Gaffer had owned, had trained, had ridden, and he was full of anecdote\r\nconcerning them and the Gaffer. Praise of his father\'s horsemanship always\r\ncaused a cloud to gather on Ginger\'s face, and when he left the pantry\r\nSwindles chuckled. "Whenever I wants to get a rise out of Ginger I says,\r\n\'Ah, we shall never see another gentleman jock who can use the whip at a\r\nfinish like the Governor in his best days.\'"\r\n\r\nEveryone delighted in the pantry, and to make Mr. Leopold comfortable Mr.\r\nSwindles used to bring in the wolf-skin rug that went out with the\r\ncarriage, and wrap it round Mr. Leopold\'s wooden armchair, and the sallow\r\nlittle man would curl himself up, and, smoking his long clay, discuss the\r\nweights of the next big handicap. If Ginger contradicted him he would go\r\nto the press and extract from its obscurity a package of _Bell\'s Life_ or\r\na file of the _Sportsman_.\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold\'s press! For forty years no one had looked into that press.\r\nMr. Leopold guarded it from every gaze, but it seemed to be a much-varied\r\nrepository from which, if he chose, he could produce almost any trifle\r\nthat might be required. It seemed to combine the usefulness of a hardware\r\nshop and a drug store.\r\n\r\nThe pantry had its etiquette and its discipline. Jockey boys were rarely\r\nadmitted, unless with the intention of securing their services for the\r\ncleaning of boots or knives. William was very proud of his right of entry.\r\nFor that half-hour in the pantry he would willingly surrender the pleasure\r\nof walking in the drove-way with Sarah. But when Mrs. Latch learnt that he\r\nwas there her face darkened, and the noise she then made about the range\r\nwith her saucepans was alarming. Mrs. Barfield shared her cook\'s horror of\r\nthe pantry, and often spoke of Mr. Leopold as "that little man." Although\r\noutwardly the family butler, he had never ceased to be the Gaffer\'s\r\nprivate servant; he represented the old days of bachelorhood. Mrs.\r\nBarfield and Mrs. Latch both disliked him. Had it not been for his\r\ninfluence Mrs. Barfield felt sure her husband would never have returned to\r\nhis vice. Had it not been for Mr. Leopold Mrs. Latch felt that her husband\r\nwould never have taken to betting. Legends and mystery had formed around\r\nMr. Leopold and his pantry, and in Esther\'s unsophisticated mind this\r\nlittle room, with its tobacco smoke and glasses on the table, became a\r\nsymbol of all that was wicked and dangerous; and when she passed the door\r\nshe closed her ears to the loud talk and instinctively lowered her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe simplest human sentiments were abiding principles in Esther--love of\r\nGod, and love of God in the home. But above this Protestantism was human\r\nnature; and at this time Esther was, above all else, a young girl. Her\r\ntwentieth year thrilled within her; she was no longer weary with work, and\r\nnew, rich blood filled her veins. She sang at her work, gladdened by the\r\nsights and sounds of the yard; the young rooks cawing lustily in the\r\nevergreens, the gardener passing to and fro with plants in his hands, the\r\nwhite cats licking themselves in the sun or running to meet the young\r\nladies who brought them plates of milk. Then the race-horses were always\r\ngoing to or coming from the downs. Sometimes they came in so covered with\r\nwhite mud that part of their toilette was accomplished in the yard; and\r\nfrom her kitchen window she could see the beautiful creature haltered to\r\nthe hook fixed in the high wall, and the little boy in his shirtsleeves\r\nand hitched-up trousers, not a bit afraid, but shouting and quieting him\r\ninto submission with the stick when he kicked and bit, tickled by the\r\nwashing brush passing under the belly. Then the wrestling, sparring,\r\nball-playing of the lads when their work was done, the pale, pathetic\r\nfigure of the Demon watching them. He was about to start for Portslade and\r\nback, wrapped, as he would put it, in a red-hot scorcher of an overcoat.\r\n\r\nEsther often longed for a romp with these boys; she was now prime\r\nfavourite with them. Once they caught her in the hay yard, and fine sport\r\nit was in the warm hay throwing each other over. Sometimes her wayward\r\ntemper would get the better of her, but her momentary rage vanished at the\r\nsound of laughter. And after their tussling they would walk a little while\r\npensively, until perhaps one, with an adroit trip, would send the other\r\nrolling over on the grass, and then, with wild cries, they would run down\r\nthe drove-way. Then there was the day when the Wool-gatherer told her he\r\nwas in love, and what fun they had had, and how well she had led him into\r\nbelief that she was jealous! She had taken a rope as if she were going to\r\nhang herself, and having fastened it to a branch, she had knelt down as if\r\nshe were saying her prayers. The poor Wool-gatherer could stand it no\r\nlonger; he had rushed to her side, swearing that if she would promise not\r\nto hang herself he would never look at another girl again. The other boys,\r\nwho had been crouching in the drove-way, rose up. How they did chaff the\r\nWool-gatherer! He had burst into tears and Esther had felt sorry for him,\r\nand almost inclined to marry him out of pity for his forlorn condition.\r\n\r\nHer life grew happier and happier. She forgot that Mrs. Latch would not\r\nteach her how to make jellies, and had grown somewhat used to Sarah\'s\r\nallusions to her ignorance. She was still very poor, had not sufficient\r\nclothes, and her life was full of little troubles; but there were\r\ncompensations. It was to her that Mrs. Barfield always came when she\r\nwanted anything in a hurry, and Miss Mary, too, seemed to prefer to apply\r\nto Esther when she wanted milk for her cats or bran and oats for her\r\nrabbits.\r\n\r\nThe Gaffer and his race-horses, the Saint and her greenhouse--so went the\r\nstream of life at Woodview. What few visitors came were entertained by\r\nMiss Mary in the drawing-room or on the tennis lawn. Mrs. Barfield saw no\r\none. She desired to remain in her old gown--an old thing that her daughter\r\nhad discarded long ago--pinned up around her, and on her head an old\r\nbonnet with a faded poppy hanging from the crown. In such attire she\r\nwished to be allowed to trot about to and fro from her greenhouse to her\r\npotting-shed, watering, pruning, and syringing her plants. These plants\r\nwere dearer than all things to her except her children; she seemed,\r\nindeed, to treat them as if they were children, and with the sun pouring\r\nthrough the glass down on her back she would sit freeing them from\r\ndevouring insects all the day long. She would carry can after can of water\r\nup the long path and never complain of fatigue. She broke into complaint\r\nonly when Miss Mary forgot to feed her pets, of which she had a great\r\nnumber--rabbits, and cats, and rooks, and all the work devolved upon her.\r\nShe could not see these poor dumb creatures hungry, and would trudge to\r\nthe stables, coming back laden with trusses of hay. But it was sometimes\r\nmore than a pair of hands could do, and she would send Esther with scraps\r\nof meat and bread and milk to the unfortunate rooks that Mary had so\r\nunmercifully forgotten. "I\'ll have no more pets," she\'d say, "Miss Mary\r\nwon\'t look after them, and all the trouble falls upon me. See these poor\r\ncats, how they come mewing round my skirts." She loved to expatiate on her\r\ninexhaustible affection for dumb animals, and she continued an anecdotal\r\ndiscourse till, suddenly wearying of it, she would break off and speak to\r\nEsther about Barnstaple and the Brethren.\r\n\r\nThe Saint loved to hear Esther tell of her father and the little shop in\r\nBarnstaple, of the prayer-meetings and the simple earnestness and\r\nnarrowness of the faith of those good Brethren. Circumstances had effaced,\r\nthough they had not obliterated, the once sharply-marked confines of her\r\nreligious habits. Her religion was like a garden--a little less sedulously\r\ntended than of yore, but no whit less fondly loved; and while listening to\r\nEsther\'s story she dreamed her own early life over again, and paused,\r\nlaying down her watering-can, penetrated with the happiness of gentle\r\nmemories. So Esther\'s life grew and was fashioned; so amid the ceaseless\r\nround of simple daily occupations mistress and maid learned to know and to\r\nlove one another, and became united and strengthful in the tender and\r\nineffable sympathies of race and religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer drowsed, baking the turf on the hills, and after every gallop\r\nthe Gaffer passed his fingers along the fine legs of the crack, in fear\r\nand apprehension lest he should detect any swelling. William came every\r\nday for news. He had five shillings on; he stood to win five pounds\r\nten--quite a little fortune--and he often stopped to ask Esther if there\r\nwas any news as he made his way to the pantry. She told him that so far as\r\nshe knew Silver Braid was all right, and continued shaking the rug.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never get the dust out of that rug," he said at last, "here, give\r\nit to me." She hesitated, then gave it him, and he beat it against the\r\nbrick wall. "There," he said, handing it back to her, "that\'s how I beats\r\na mat; you won\'t find much dust in it now."\r\n\r\n"Thank you.... Sarah went by an hour and a half ago."\r\n\r\n"Ah, she must have gone to the Gardens. You have never been to those\r\ngardens, have you? Dancing-hall, theatre, sorcerers--every blessed thing.\r\nBut you\'re that religious, I suppose you wouldn\'t come?"\r\n\r\n"It is only the way you are brought up."\r\n\r\n"Well, will you come?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I should like those Gardens.... But I daresay they are no\r\nworse than any other place. I\'ve heard so much since I was here, that\r\nreally----"\r\n\r\n"That really what?"\r\n\r\n"That sometimes it seems useless like to be particular."\r\n\r\n"Of course--all rot. Well, will you come next Sunday?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not on Sunday."\r\n\r\nThe Gaffer had engaged him as footman: his livery would be ready by\r\nSaturday, and he would enter service on Monday week. This reminded them\r\nthat henceforth they would see each other every day, and, speaking of the\r\npain it would give his mother when he came running downstairs to go out\r\nwith the carriage, he said--\r\n\r\n"It was always her idea that I shouldn\'t be a servant, but I believe in\r\ndoing what you gets most coin for doing. I should like to have been a\r\njockey, and I could have ridden well enough--the Gaffer thought better at\r\none time of my riding than he did of Ginger\'s. But I never had any luck;\r\nwhen I was about fifteen I began to grow.... If I could have remained like\r\nthe Demon----"\r\n\r\nEsther looked at him, wondering if he were speaking seriously, and really\r\nwished away his splendid height and shoulders.\r\n\r\nA few days later he tried to persuade her to take a ticket in a shilling\r\nsweepstakes which he was getting up among the out and the indoor servants.\r\nShe pleaded poverty--her wages would not be due till the end of August.\r\nBut William offered to lend her the money, and he pressed the hat\r\ncontaining the bits of paper on which were written the horses\' names so\r\ninsinuatingly upon her that a sudden impulse to oblige him came over her,\r\nand before she had time to think she had put her hand in the hat and taken\r\na number.\r\n\r\n"Come, none of your betting and gambling in my kitchen," said Mrs. Latch,\r\nturning from her work. "Why can\'t you leave that innocent girl alone?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be that disagreeable, mother; it ain\'t betting, it\'s a\r\nsweepstakes."\r\n\r\n"It is all the same," muttered Mrs. Latch; "it always begins that way, and\r\nit goes on from bad to worse. I never saw any good come from it, and\r\nHeaven knows I\'ve seen enough misfortune."\r\n\r\nMargaret and Sarah paused, looking at her open-mouthed, a little\r\nperplexed, holding the numbers they had drawn in both hands. Esther had\r\nnot unfolded hers. She looked at Mrs. Latch and regretted having taken the\r\nticket in the lottery. She feared jeers from Sarah, or from Grover, who\r\nhad just come in, for her inability to read the name of the horse she had\r\ndrawn. Seeing her dilemma, William took her paper from her.\r\n\r\n"Silver Braid.... by Jingo! She has got the right one."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the sound of hoofs was heard in the yard, and the servants\r\nflew to the window.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll win," cried William, leaning over the women\'s backs, waving his\r\nbony hand to the Demon, who rode past on Silver Braid. "The Gaffer will\r\nbring him to the post as fit as a fiddle."\r\n\r\n"I think he will," said Mr. Leopold. "The rain has done us a lot of good;\r\nhe was beginning to go a bit short a week ago. We shall want some more\r\nrain. I should like to see it come down for the next week or more."\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold\'s desires looked as if they were going to be fulfilled. The\r\nheavens seemed to have taken the fortunes of the stable in hand. Rain fell\r\ngenerally in the afternoon and night, leaving the mornings fine, and\r\nSilver Braid went the mile gaily, becoming harder and stronger. And in the\r\nintermittent swish of showers blown up from the sea Woodview grew joyous,\r\nand a conviction of ultimate triumph gathered and settled on every face\r\nexcept Mrs. Barfield\'s and Mrs. Latch\'s. And askance they looked at the\r\ntriumphant little butler. He became more and more the topic of\r\nconversation. He seemed to hold the thread of their destiny in his press.\r\nPeggy was especially afraid of him.\r\n\r\nAnd, continuing her confidences to the under-housemaid, the young lady\r\nsaid, "I like to know things for the pleasure of talking about them, but\r\nhe for the pleasure of holding his tongue." Peggy was Miss Margaret\r\nBarfield, a cousin, the daughter of a rich brewer. "If he brings in your\r\nletters in the morning he hands them to you just as if he knew whom they\r\nare from. Ugly little beast; it irritates me when he comes into the room."\r\n\r\n"He hates women, Miss; he never lets us near his pantry, and he keeps\r\nWilliam there talking racing."\r\n\r\n"Ah, William is very different. He ought never to have been a servant. His\r\nfamily was once quite as good as the Barfields."\r\n\r\n"So I have heard, Miss. But the world is that full of ups and downs you\r\nnever can tell who is who. But we all likes William and \'ates that little\r\nman and his pantry. Mrs. Latch calls him the \'evil genius.\'"\r\n\r\nA furtive and clandestine little man, ashamed of his women-folk and\r\nkeeping them out of sight as much as possible. His wife a pale, dim woman,\r\ntall as he was short, preserving still some of the graces of the\r\nlady\'s-maid, shy either by nature or by the severe rule of her lord,\r\nalways anxious to obliterate herself against the hedges when you met her\r\nin the lane or against the pantry door when any of the family knocked to\r\nask for hot water, or came with a letter for the post. By nature a\r\nbachelor, he was instinctively ashamed of his family, and when the\r\nweary-looking wife, the thin, shy girl, or the corpulent, stupid-faced son\r\nwere with him and he heard steps outside, he would come out like a little\r\nwasp, and, unmistakably resenting the intrusion, would ask what was\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nIf it were Ginger, Mr. Leopold would say, "Can I do anything for you, Mr.\r\nArthur?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing, thank you; I only thought that----" and Ginger would invent\r\nsome paltry excuse and slink away to smoke elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEvery day, a little before twelve, Mr. Leopold went out for his morning\r\nwalk; every day if it were fine you would meet him at that hour in the\r\nlane either coming from or going to Shoreham. For thirty years he had done\r\nhis little constitutional, always taking the same road, always starting\r\nwithin a few minutes of twelve, always returning in time to lay the cloth\r\nfor lunch at half-past one. The hour between twelve and one he spent in\r\nthe little cottage which he rented from the squire for his wife and\r\nchildren, or in the "Red Lion," where he had a glass of beer and talked\r\nwith Watkins, the bookmaker.\r\n\r\n"There he goes, off to the \'Red Lion,\'" said Mrs. Latch. "They try to get\r\nsome information out of him, but he\'s too sharp for them, and he knows it;\r\nthat\'s what he goes there for--just for the pleasure of seeing them\r\nswallow the lies he tells them.... He has been telling them lies about the\r\nhorses for the last twenty years, and still he get them to believe what he\r\nsays. It is a cruel shame! It was the lies he told poor Jackson about Blue\r\nBeard that made the poor man back the horse for all he was worth."\r\n\r\n"And the horse didn\'t win?"\r\n\r\n"Win! The master didn\'t even intend to run him, and Jackson lost all he\r\nhad, and more. He went down to the river and drowned himself. John Randal\r\nhas that man\'s death on his conscience. But his conscience don\'t trouble\r\nhim much; if it did he\'d be in his grave long ago. Lies, lies, nothing but\r\nlies! But I daresay I\'m too \'ard on him; isn\'t lies our natural lot? What\r\nis servants for but to lie when it is in their master\'s interest, and to\r\nbe a confidential servant is to be the Prince of liars!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he didn\'t know the \'orse was scratched."\r\n\r\n"I see you are falling in nicely with the lingo of the trade."\r\n\r\n"Oh," replied Esther, laughing; "one never hears anything else; one picks\r\nit up without knowing. Mr. Leopold is very rich, so they say. The boys\r\ntell me that he won a pile over the City and Suburban, and has thousands\r\nin the bank."\r\n\r\n"So some says; but who knows what he has? One hears of the winnings, but\r\nthey say very little about the losings."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boys were playing ball in the stables, but she did not feel as if she\r\nwanted to romp with them. There was a stillness and a sweetness abroad\r\nwhich penetrated and absorbed her. She moved towards the paddock gate; the\r\npony and the donkey came towards her, and she rubbed their muzzles in\r\nturn. It was a pleasure to touch anything, especially anything alive. She\r\neven noticed that the elm trees were strangely tall and still against the\r\ncalm sky, and the rich odour of some carnations which came through the\r\nbushes from the pleasure-ground excited her; the scent of earth and leaves\r\ntingled in her, and the cawing of the rooks coming home took her soul away\r\nskyward in an exquisite longing; she was, at the same time, full of\r\nromantic love for the earth, and of a desire to mix herself with the\r\ninnermost essence of things. The beauty of the evening and the sea breeze\r\ninstilled a sensation of immortal health, and she wondered if a young man\r\ncame to her as young men came to the great ladies in Sarah\'s books, how it\r\nwould be to talk in the dusk, seeing the bats flitting and the moon rising\r\nthrough the branches.\r\n\r\nThe family was absent from Woodview, and she was free to enjoy the beauty\r\nof every twilight and every rising moon for still another week. But she\r\nwearied for a companion. Sarah and Grover were far too grand to walk out\r\nwith her; and Margaret had a young man who came to fetch her, and in their\r\nroom at night she related all he had said. But for Esther there was\r\nnothing to do all the long summer evenings but to sit at the kitchen\r\nwindow sewing. Her hands fell on her lap, and her heart heaved a sigh of\r\nweariness. In all this world there was nothing for her to do but to\r\ncontinue her sewing or to go for a walk on the hill. She was tired of that\r\nweary hill! But she could not sit in the kitchen till bedtime. She might\r\nmeet the old shepherd coming home with his sheep, and she put a piece of\r\nbread in her pocket for his dogs and strolled up the hill-side. Margaret\r\nhad gone down to the Gardens. One of these days a young man would come to\r\ntake her out. What would he be like? She laughed the thought away. She did\r\nnot think that any young man would bother much about her. Happening at\r\nthat moment to look round, she saw a man coming through the hunting gate.\r\nHis height and shoulders told her that he was William. "Trying to find\r\nSarah," she thought. "I must not let him think I am waiting for him." She\r\ncontinued her walk, wondering if he were following, afraid to look round.\r\nAt last she fancied she could hear footsteps; her heart beat faster. He\r\ncalled to her.\r\n\r\n"I think Sarah has gone to the Gardens," she said, turning round.\r\n\r\n"You always keep reminding me of Sarah. There\'s nothing between us;\r\nanything there ever was is all off long ago.... Are you going for a walk?"\r\n\r\nShe was glad of the chance to get a mouthful of fresh air, and they went\r\ntowards the hunting gate. William held it open and she passed through.\r\n\r\nThe plantations were enclosed by a wooden fence, and beyond them the bare\r\ndowns rose hill after hill. On the left the land sloped into a shallow\r\nvalley sown with various crops; and the shaws about Elliot\'s farm were the\r\nlast trees. Beyond the farmhouse the downs ascended higher and higher,\r\ntreeless, irreclaimable, scooped into long patriarchal solitudes, thrown\r\ninto wild crests.\r\n\r\nThere was a smell of sheep in the air, and the flock trotted past them in\r\ngood order, followed by the shepherd, a huge hat and a crook in his hand,\r\nand two shaggy dogs at his heels. A brace of partridges rose out of the\r\nsainfoin, and flew down the hills; and watching their curving flight\r\nEsther and William saw the sea under the sun-setting, and the string of\r\ncoast towns.\r\n\r\n"A lovely evening, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nEsther acquiesced; and tempted by the warmth of the grass they sat down,\r\nand the mystery of the twilight found way into their consciousness.\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t have any rain yet awhile."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you," William answered, eager to show his superior knowledge.\r\n"Look due south-west, straight through that last dip in that line of\r\nhills. Do you see anything?"\r\n\r\n"No, I can see nothing," said Esther, after straining her eyes for a few\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\n"I thought not.... Well, if it was going to rain you would see the Isle of\r\nWight."\r\n\r\nFor something to say, and hoping to please, Esther asked him where the\r\nrace-course was.\r\n\r\n"There, over yonder. I can\'t show you the start, a long way behind that\r\nhill, Portslade way; then they come right along by that gorse and finish\r\nup by Truly barn--you can\'t see Truly barn from here, that\'s Thunder\'s\r\nbarrow barn; they go quite half a mile farther."\r\n\r\n"And does all that land belong to the Gaffer?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and a great deal more, too; but this down land isn\'t worth much--not\r\nmore than about ten shillings an acre."\r\n\r\n"And how many acres are there?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean all that we can see?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"The Gaffer\'s property reaches to Southwick Hill, and it goes north a long\r\nway. I suppose you don\'t know that all this piece, all that lies between\r\nus and that barn yonder, once belonged to my family."\r\n\r\n"To your family?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Latches were once big swells; in the time of my\r\ngreat-grandfather the Barfields could not hold their heads as high as the\r\nLatches. My great-grandfather had a pot of money, but it all went."\r\n\r\n"Racing?"\r\n\r\n"A good bit, I\'ve no doubt. A rare \'ard liver, cock-fighting, \'unting,\r\n\'orse-racing from one year\'s end to the other. Then after \'im came my\r\ngrandfather; he went to the law, and a sad mess he made of it--went\r\nstony-broke and left my father without a sixpence; that is why mother\r\ndidn\'t want me to go into livery. The family \'ad been coming down for\r\ngenerations, and mother thought that I was born to restore it; and so I\r\nwas, but not as she thought, by carrying parcels up and down the King\'s\r\nRoad."\r\n\r\nEsther looked at William in silent admiration, and, feeling that he had\r\nsecured an appreciative listener, he continued his monologue regarding the\r\nwealth and rank his family had formerly held, till a heavy dew forced them\r\nto their feet. In front of them was the moon, and out of the forlorn sky\r\nlooked down the misted valleys; the crests of the hills were still touched\r\nwith light, and lights flew from coast town to coast town, weaving a\r\nluminous garland.\r\n\r\nThe sheep had been folded, and seeing them lying in the greyness of this\r\nhill-side, and beyond them the massive moonlit landscape and the vague\r\nsea, Esther suddenly became aware, as she had never done before, of the\r\nexceeding beauty of the world. Looking up in William\'s face, she said--\r\n\r\n"Oh, how beautiful!"\r\n\r\nAs they descended the drove-way their feet raised the chalk, and William\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"This is bad for Silver Braid; we shall want some more rain in a day or\r\ntwo.... Let\'s come for a walk round the farm," he said suddenly. "The farm\r\nbelongs to the Gaffer, but he\'s let the Lodge to a young fellow called\r\nJohnson. He\'s the chap that Peggy used to go after--there was awful rows\r\nabout that, and worse when he forestalled the Gaffer about Egmont."\r\n\r\nThe conversation wandered agreeably, and they became more conscious of\r\neach other. He told her all he knew about the chap who had jilted Miss\r\nMary, and the various burlesque actresses at the Shoreham Gardens who had\r\ncaptivated Ginger\'s susceptible heart. While listening she suddenly became\r\naware that she had never been so happy before. Now all she had endured\r\nseemed accidental; she felt that she had entered into the permanent; and\r\nin the midst of vague but intense sensations William showed her the\r\npigeon-house with all the blue birds dozing on the tiles, a white one here\r\nand there. They visited the workshop, the forge, and the old cottages\r\nwhere the bailiff and the shepherd lived; and all this inanimate\r\nnature--the most insignificant objects--seemed inspired, seemed like\r\nsymbols of her emotion.\r\n\r\nThey left the farm and wandered on the high road until a stile leading to\r\na cornfield beguiled and then delayed their steps.\r\n\r\nThe silence of the moonlight was clear and immense; and they listened to\r\nthe trilling of the nightingale in the copse hard by. First they sought to\r\ndiscover the brown bird in the branches of the poor hedge, and then the\r\nreason of the extraordinary emotion in their hearts. It seemed that all\r\nlife was beating in that moment, and they were as it were inflamed to\r\nreach out their hands to life and to grasp it together. Even William\r\nnoticed that. And the moon shone on the mist that had gathered on the long\r\nmarsh lands of the foreshore. Beyond the trees the land wavered out into\r\ndown land, the river gleamed and intensely.\r\n\r\nThis moment was all the poetry of their lives. The striking of a match to\r\nlight his pipe, which had gone out, put the music to flight, and all along\r\nthe white road he continued his monologue, interrupted only by the\r\nnecessity of puffing at his pipe.\r\n\r\n"Mother says that if I had twopence worth of pride in me I wouldn\'t have\r\nconsented to put on the livery; but what I says to mother is, \'What\'s the\r\nuse of having pride if you haven\'t money?\' I tells her that I am rotten\r\nwith pride, but my pride is to make money. I can\'t see that the man what\r\nis willing to remain poor all his life has any pride at all.... But, Lord!\r\nI have argued with mother till I\'m sick; she can see nothing further than\r\nthe livery; that\'s what women are--they are that short-sighted.... A lot\r\nof good it would have done me to have carried parcels all my life, and\r\nwhen I could do four mile an hour no more, to be turned out to die in the\r\nditch and be buried by the parish. \'Not good enough,\' says I. \'If that\'s\r\nyour pride, mother, you may put it in your pipe and smoke it, and as you\r\n\'aven\'t got a pipe, perhaps behind the oven will do as well,\'--that\'s what\r\nI said to her. I saw well enough there was nothing for me but service, and\r\nI means to stop here until I can get on three or four good things and then\r\nretire into a nice comfortable public-house and do my own betting."\r\n\r\n"You would give up betting then?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d give up backing \'orses, if you mean that.... What I should like would\r\nbe to get on to a dozen good things at long prices--half-a-dozen like\r\nSilver Braid would do it. For a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds I could\r\nhave the \'Red Lion,\' and just inside my own bar I could do a hundred-pound\r\nbook on all the big races."\r\n\r\nEsther listened, hearing interminable references to jockeys, publicans,\r\nweights, odds, and the certainty, if he had the "Red Lion," of being able\r\nto get all Joe Walker\'s betting business away from him. Allusions to the\r\npolice, and the care that must be taken not to bet with anyone who had not\r\nbeen properly introduced, frightened her; but her fears died in the\r\nsensation of his arm about her waist, and the music that the striking of a\r\nmatch had put to flight had begun again in the next plantation, and it\r\nbegan again in their hearts. But if he were going to marry Sarah! The idea\r\namused him; he laughed loudly, and they walked up the avenue, his face\r\nbent over hers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Barfield calculation was that they had a stone in hand. Bayleaf, Mr.\r\nLeopold argued, would be backed to win a million of money if he were\r\nhandicapped in the race at seven stone; and Silver Braid, who had been\r\ntried again with Bayleaf, and with the same result as before, had been let\r\noff with only six stone.\r\n\r\nMore rain had fallen, the hay-crop had been irretrievably ruined, the\r\nprospects of the wheat harvest were jeopardized, but what did a few\r\nbushels of wheat matter? Another pound of muscle in those superb\r\nhind-quarters was worth all the corn that could be grown between here and\r\nHenfield. Let the rain come down, let every ear of wheat be destroyed, so\r\nlong as those delicate fore-legs remained sound. These were the ethics\r\nthat obtained at Woodview, and within the last few days showed signs of\r\nadoption by the little town and not a few of the farmers, grown tired of\r\nseeing their crops rotting on the hill-sides. The fever of the gamble was\r\nin eruption, breaking out in unexpected places--the station-master, the\r\nporters, the flymen, all had their bit on, and notwithstanding the\r\nenormous favouritism of two other horses in the race--Prisoner and Stoke\r\nNewington--Silver Braid had advanced considerably in the betting. Reports\r\nof trials won had reached Brighton, and not more than five-and-twenty to\r\none could now be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that the Demon had gone up several pounds in weight had\r\nintroduced the necessary alloy into the mintage of their happiness; the\r\nmost real consternation prevailed, and the strictest investigation was\r\nmade as to when and how he had obtained the quantities of food required to\r\nproduce such a mass of adipose tissue. Then the Gaffer had the boy\r\nupstairs and administered to him a huge dose of salts, seeing him swallow\r\nevery drop; and when the effects of the medicine had worn off he was sent\r\nfor a walk to Portslade in two large overcoats, and was accompanied by\r\nWilliam, whose long legs led the way so effectively. On his return a\r\ncouple of nice feather beds were ready, and Mr. Leopold and Mr. Swindles\r\nthemselves laid him between them, and when they noticed that he was\r\nbeginning to cease to perspire Mr. Leopold made him a nice cup of hot tea.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way the Gaffer used to get the flesh off in the old days when\r\nhe rode the winner at Liverpool."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the Demon\'s own fault," said Mr. Swindles; "if he hadn\'t been so\r\ngreedy he wouldn\'t have had to sweat, and we should \'ave been spared a\r\ndeal of bother and anxiety."\r\n\r\n"Greedy!" murmured the little boy, in whom the warm tea had induced a new\r\nperspiration; "I haven\'t had what you might call a dinner for the last\r\nthree months. I think I\'ll chuck the whole thing."\r\n\r\n"Not until this race is over," said Mr. Swindles. "Supposing I was to pass\r\nthe warming-pan down these \'ere sheets. What do you say, Mr. Leopold? They\r\nare beginning to feel a bit cold."\r\n\r\n"Cold! I \'ope you\'ll never go to a \'otter place. For God\'s sake, Mr.\r\nLeopold, don\'t let him come near me with the warming-pan, or else he\'ll\r\nmelt the little flesh that\'s left off me."\r\n\r\n"You \'ad better not make such a fuss," said Mr. Leopold; "if you don\'t do\r\nwhat you are told, you\'ll have to take salts again and go for another walk\r\nwith William."\r\n\r\n"If we don\'t warm up them sheets \'e\'ll dry up," said Mr. Swindles.\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t; I\'m teeming."\r\n\r\n"Be a good boy, and you shall have a nice cut of mutton when you get up,"\r\nsaid Mr. Leopold.\r\n\r\n"How much? Two slices?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, we can\'t promise; it all depends on how much has come off,\r\nand \'aving once got it hoff, we don\'t want to put it on again."\r\n\r\n"I never did \'ear such rot," said Swindles. "In my time a boy\'s feelings\r\nweren\'t considered--one did what one considered good for them."\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold strove to engage the Demon\'s attention with compliments\r\nregarding his horsemanship in the City and Sub. while Mr. Swindles raised\r\nthe bedclothes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Swindles, you are burning me."\r\n\r\n"For \'eaven\'s sake don\'t let him start out from under the bed like that!\r\nCan\'t yer \'old him? Burning you! I never even touched you with it; it was\r\nthe sheet that you felt."\r\n\r\n"Then the sheet is at \'ot as the bloody fire. Will yer leave off?"\r\n\r\n"What! a Demon like you afraid of a little touch of \'eat; wouldn\'t \'ave\r\nbelieved it unless I \'ad \'eard it with my own ears," said Mr. Leopold.\r\n"Come, now, do yer want to ride the crack at Goodwood or do yer not? If\r\nyou do, remain quiet, and let us finish taking off the last couple of\r\npounds."\r\n\r\n"It is the last couple of pounds that takes it out of one; the first lot\r\ncomes off jest like butter," said the boy, rolling out of the way of the\r\npan. "I know what it will be; I shall be so weak that I shall just ride a\r\nstinking bad race."\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold and Mr. Swindles exchanged glances. It was clear they thought\r\nthat there was something in the last words of the fainting Demon, and the\r\npan was withdrawn. But when the boy was got into the scale again it was\r\nfound that he was not yet nearly the right weight, and the Gaffer ordered\r\nanother effort to be made. The Demon pleaded that his feet were sore, but\r\nhe was sent off to Portslade in charge of the redoubtable William.\r\n\r\nAnd as the last pounds came off the Demon\'s little carcass Mr. Leopold\'s\r\nface resumed a more tranquil expression. It began to be whispered that\r\ninstead of hedging any part of his money he would stand it all out, and\r\none day a market gardener brought up word that he had seen Mr. Leopold\r\ngoing into Brighton.\r\n\r\n"Old Watkins isn\'t good enough for him, that\'s about it. If Silver Braid\r\nwins, Woodview will see very little more of Mr. Leopold. He\'ll be for\r\nbuying one of them big houses on the sea road and keeping his own trap."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great day was now fast approaching, and the Gaffer had promised to\r\ndrive his folk in a drag to Goodwood. No more rain was required, the\r\ncolt\'s legs remained sound, and three days of sunshine would make all the\r\ndifference in their sum of happiness. In the kitchen Mrs. Latch and Esther\r\nhad been busy for some time with chickens and pies and jellies, and in the\r\npassage there were cases packed with fruit and wine. The dressmaker had\r\ncome from Worthing, and for several days the young ladies had not left\r\nher. And one fine morning, very early--about eight o\'clock--the wheelers\r\nwere backed into the drag that had come from Brighton, and the yard\r\nresounded with the blaring of the horn. Ginger was practising under his\r\nsister\'s window.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be late! You\'ll be late!"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of two young gentlemen, who had come at the invitation\r\nof the young ladies, it was quite a family party. Miss Mary sat beside her\r\nfather on the box, and looked very charming in white and blue. Peggy\'s\r\nblack hair seemed blacker than ever under a white silk parasol, which she\r\nwaved negligently above her as she stood up calling and talking to\r\neveryone until the Gaffer told her angrily to sit down, as he was going to\r\nstart. Then William and the coachman let go the leaders\' heads, and\r\nrunning side by side swung themselves into their seats. At the same moment\r\na glimpse was caught of Mr. Leopold\'s sallow profile amid the boxes and\r\nthe mackintoshes that filled the inside of the coach.\r\n\r\n"Oh, William did look that handsome in those beautiful new clothes!\r\n...Everyone said so--Sarah and Margaret and Miss Grover. I\'m sorry you did\r\nnot come out to see him."\r\n\r\nMrs. Latch made no answer, and Esther remembered how she hated her son to\r\nwear livery, and thought that she had perhaps made a mistake in saying\r\nthat Mrs. Latch should have come out to see him. "Perhaps this will make\r\nher dislike me again," thought the girl. Mrs. Latch moved about rapidly,\r\nand she opened and closed the oven; then, raising her eyes to the window\r\nand seeing that the other women were still standing in the yard and safely\r\nout of hearing, she said--\r\n\r\n"Do you think that he has bet much on this race?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, how should I know, Mrs. Latch?... But the horse is certain to win."\r\n\r\n"Certain to win! I have heard that tale before; they are always certain to\r\nwin. So they have won you round to their way of thinking, have they?" said\r\nMrs. Latch, straightening her back.\r\n\r\n"I know very well indeed that it is not right to bet; but what can I do, a\r\npoor girl like me? If it hadn\'t been for William I never would have taken\r\na number in that sweepstakes."\r\n\r\n"Do you like him very much, then?"\r\n\r\n"He has been very kind to me--he was kind when--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know, when I was unkind. I was unkind to you when you first came.\r\nYou don\'t know all. I was much troubled at that time, and somehow I did\r\nnot--. But there is no ill-feeling?... I\'ll make it up to you--I\'ll teach\r\nyou how to be a cook."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Latch, I am sure----"\r\n\r\n"Never mind that. When you went out to walk with him the other night, did\r\nhe tell you that he had many bets on the race?"\r\n\r\n"He talked about the race, like everyone else, but he did not tell me what\r\nbets he had on."\r\n\r\n"No, they never do do that.... But you\'ll not tell him that I asked you?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mrs. Latch, I promise."\r\n\r\n"It would do no good, he\'d only be angry; it would only set him against\r\nme. I am afraid that nothing will stop him now. Once they get a taste for\r\nit it is like drink. I wish he was married, that might get him out of it.\r\nSome woman who would have an influence over him, some strong-minded woman.\r\nI thought once that you were strong-minded----"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Sarah and Grover entered the kitchen talking loudly. They\r\nasked Mrs. Latch how soon they could have dinner--the sooner the better,\r\nfor the Saint had told them that they were free to go out for the day.\r\nThey were to try to be back before eight, that was all. Ah! the Saint was\r\na first-rate sort. She had said that she did not want anyone to attend on\r\nher. She would, get herself a bit of lunch in the dining-room. Mrs. Latch\r\nallowed Esther to hurry on the dinner, and by one o\'clock they had all\r\nfinished. Sarah and Margaret were going into Brighton to do some shopping,\r\nGrover was going to Worthing to spend the afternoon with the wife of one\r\nof the guards of the Brighton and South Coast Railway. Mrs. Latch went\r\nupstairs to lie down. So it grew lonelier and lonelier in the kitchen.\r\nEsther\'s sewing fell out of her hands, and she wondered what she should\r\ndo. She thought that she might go down to the beach, and soon after she\r\nput on her hat and stood thinking, remembering that she had not been by\r\nthe sea, that she had not seen the sea since she was a little girl. But\r\nshe remembered the tall ships that came into the harbour, sail falling\r\nover sail, and the tall ships that floated out of the harbour, sail rising\r\nover sail, catching the breeze as they went aloft--she remembered them.\r\n\r\nA suspension bridge, ornamented with straight-tailed lions, took her over\r\nthe weedy river, and having crossed some pieces of rough grass, she\r\nclimbed the shingle bank. The heat rippled the blue air, and the sea, like\r\nan exhausted caged beast, licked the shingle. Sea-poppies bloomed under\r\nthe wheels of a decaying bathing-machine, and Esther wondered. But the sea\r\nhere was lonely as a prison, and, seeing the treeless coast with its chain\r\nof towns, her thoughts suddenly reverted to William. She wished he were\r\nwith her, and for pleasant contemplation she thought of that happy evening\r\nwhen she saw him coming through the hunting gate, when, his arm about her,\r\nWilliam had explained that if the horse won she would take seven shillings\r\nout of the sweepstakes. She knew now that William did not care about\r\nSarah; and that he cared for her had given a sudden and unexpected meaning\r\nto her existence. She lay on the shingle, her day-dream becoming softer\r\nand more delicate as it rounded into summer sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd when the light awoke her she saw flights of white clouds--white up\r\nabove, rose-coloured as they approached the west; and when she turned, a\r\ntall, melancholy woman.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Mrs. Randal," said Esther, glad to find someone to speak\r\nto. "I\'ve been asleep."\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Miss. You\'re from Woodview, I think?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m the kitchen-maid. They\'ve gone to the races; there was nothing\r\nto do, so I came down here."\r\n\r\nMrs. Randal\'s lips moved as if she were going to say something. But she\r\ndid not speak. Soon after she rose to her feet. "I think that it must be\r\ngetting near tea-time; I must be going. You might come in and have a cup\r\nof tea with me, if you\'re not in a hurry back to Woodview."\r\n\r\nEsther was surprised at so much condescension, and in silence the two\r\nwomen crossed the meadows that lay between the shingle bank and the river.\r\nTrains were passing all the while, scattering, it seemed, in their noisy\r\npassage over the spider-legged bridge, the news from Goodwood. The news\r\nseemed to be borne along shore in the dust, and, as if troubled by\r\nprescience of the news, Mrs. Randal said, as she unlocked the cottage\r\ndoor----\r\n\r\n"It is all over now. The people in those trains know well enough which has\r\nwon."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose they know, and somehow I feel as if I knew too. I feel as\r\nif Silver Braid had won."\r\n\r\nMrs. Randal\'s home was gaunt as herself. Everything looked as if it had\r\nbeen scraped, and the spare furniture expressed a meagre, lonely life. She\r\ndropped a plate as she laid the table, and stood pathetically looking at\r\nthe pieces. When Esther asked for a teaspoon she gave way utterly.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t one to give you; I had forgotten that they were gone. I should\r\nhave remembered and not asked you to tea."\r\n\r\n"It don\'t matter, Mrs. Randal; I can stir up my tea with anything--a\r\nknitting-needle will do very well--"\r\n\r\n"I should have remembered and not asked you back to tea; but I was so\r\nmiserable, and it is so lonely sitting in this house, that I could stand\r\nit no longer.... Talking to you saved me from thinking, and I did not want\r\nto think until this race was over. If Silver Braid is beaten we are\r\nruined. Indeed, I don\'t know what will become of us. For fifteen years I\r\nhave borne up; I have lived on little at the best of times, and very often\r\nhave gone without; but that is nothing compared to the anxiety--to see him\r\ncome in with a white face, to see him drop into a chair and hear him say,\r\n\'Beaten a head on the post,\' or \'Broke down, otherwise he would have won\r\nin a canter.\' I have always tried to be a good wife and tried to console\r\nhim, and to do the best when he said, \'I have lost half a year\'s wages, I\r\ndon\'t know how we shall pull through.\' I have borne with ten thousand\r\ntimes more than I can tell you. The sufferings of a gambler\'s wife cannot\r\nbe told. Tell me, what do you think my feelings must have been when one\r\nnight I heard him calling me out of my sleep, when I heard him say, \'I\r\ncan\'t die, Annie, without bidding you good-bye. I can only hope that you\r\nwill be able to pull through, and I know that the Gaffer will do all he\r\ncan for you, but he has been hit awful hard too. You mustn\'t think too\r\nbadly of me, Annie, but I have had such a bad time that I couldn\'t put up\r\nwith it any longer, and I thought the best thing I could do would be to\r\ngo.\' That\'s just how he talked--nice words to hear your husband speak in\r\nyour ear through the darkness! There was no time to send for the doctor,\r\nso I jumped out of bed, put the kettle on, and made him drink glass after\r\nglass of salt and water. At last he brought up the laudanum."\r\n\r\nEsther listened to the melancholy woman, and remembered the little man\r\nwhom she saw every day so orderly, so precise, so sedate, so methodical,\r\nso unemotional, into whose life she thought no faintest emotion had ever\r\nentered--and this was the truth.\r\n\r\n"So long as I only had myself to think of I didn\'t mind; but now there are\r\nthe children growing up. He should think of them. Heaven only knows what\r\nwill become of them... John is as kind a husband as ever was if it weren\'t\r\nfor that one fault; but he cannot resist having something on any more than\r\na drunkard can resist the bar-room."\r\n\r\n"Winner, winner, winner of the Stewards\' Cup!"\r\n\r\nThe women started to their feet. When they got into the street the boy was\r\nfar away; besides, neither had a penny to pay for the paper, and they\r\nwandered about the town hearing and seeing nothing, so nervous were they.\r\nAt last Esther proposed to ask at the "Red Lion" who had won. Mrs. Randal\r\nbegged her to refrain, urging that she was unable to bear the tidings\r\nshould it be evil.\r\n\r\n"Silver Braid," the barman answered. The girl rushed through the doors.\r\n"It is all right, it is all right; he has won!"\r\n\r\nSoon after the little children in the lane were calling forth "Silver\r\nBraid won!" And overcome by the excitement Esther walked along the\r\nsea-road to meet the drag. She walked on and on until the sound of the\r\nhorn came through the crimson evening and she saw the leaders trotting in\r\na cloud of dust. Ginger was driving, and he shouted to her, "He won!" The\r\nGaffer waved the horn and shouted, "He won!" Peggy waved her broken\r\nparasol and shouted, "He won!" Esther looked at William. He leaned over\r\nthe back seat and shouted, "He won!" She had forgotten all about late\r\ndinner. What would Mrs. Latch say? On such a day as this she would say\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly everything came down untouched. Eating and drinking had been in\r\nprogress almost all day on the course, and Esther had finished washing up\r\nbefore nine, and had laid the cloth in the servants\' hall for supper. But\r\nif little was eaten upstairs, plenty was eaten downstairs; the mutton was\r\nfinished in a trice, and Mrs. Latch had to fetch from the larder what\r\nremained of a beefsteak pudding. Even then they were not satisfied, and\r\nfine inroads were made into a new piece of cheese. Beer, according to\r\norders, was served without limit, and four bottles of port were sent down\r\nso that the health of the horse might be adequately drunk.\r\n\r\nWhile assuaging their hunger the men had exchanged many allusive remarks\r\nregarding the Demon\'s bad ending, how nearly he had thrown the race away;\r\nand the meal being now over, and there being nothing to do but to sit and\r\ntalk, Mr. Leopold, encouraged by William, entered on an elaborate and\r\ntechnical account of the race. The women listened, playing with a rind of\r\ncheese, glancing at the cheese itself, wondering if they could manage\r\nanother slice, and the men sipping their port wine, puffing at their\r\npipes, William listening most avidly of all, enjoying each sporting term,\r\nand ingeniously reminding Mr. Leopold of some detail whenever he seemed\r\ndisposed to shorten his narrative. The criticism of the Demon\'s\r\nhorsemanship took a long while, for by a variety of suggestive remarks\r\nWilliam led Mr. Leopold into reminiscences of the skill of certain famous\r\njockeys in the first half of the century. These digressions wearied Sarah\r\nand Grover, and their thoughts wandered to the dresses that had been worn\r\nthat day, and the lady\'s-maid remembered she would hear all that\r\ninterested her that night in the young ladies\' rooms. At last, losing all\r\npatience, Sarah declared that she didn\'t care what Chifney had said when\r\nhe just managed to squeeze his horse\'s head in front in the last dozen\r\nyards, she wanted to know what the Demon had done to so nearly lose the\r\nrace--had he mistaken the winning-post and pulled up? William looked at\r\nher contemptuously, and would have answered rudely, but at that moment Mr.\r\nLeopold began to tell the last instructions that the Gaffer had given the\r\nDemon. The orders were that the Demon should go right up to the leaders\r\nbefore they reached the half-mile, and remain there. Of course, if he\r\nfound that he was a stone or more in hand, as the Gaffer expected, he\r\nmight come away pretty well as he liked, for the greatest danger was that\r\nthe horse might get shut out or might show temper and turn it up.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Leopold, "there were two false starts, and Silver Braid\r\nmust have galloped a couple of \'undred yards afore the Demon could stop\r\nhim. There wasn\'t twopence-halfpenny worth of strength in him--pulling off\r\nthose three or four pounds pretty well finished him. He\'ll never be able\r\nto ride that weight again.... He said afore starting that he felt weak;\r\nyou took him along too smartly from Portslade the last time you went\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"When he went by himself he\'d stop playing marbles with the boys round the\r\nSouthwick public-house."\r\n\r\n"If there had been another false start I think it would have been all up\r\nwith us. The Gaffer was quite pale, and he stood there not taking his\r\nglasses from his eyes. There were over thirty of them, so you can imagine\r\nhow hard it was to get them into line. However, at the third attempt they\r\nwere got straight and away they came, a black line stretching right across\r\nthe course. Presently the black cap and jacket came to the front, and not\r\nvery long after a murmur went round, \'Silver Braid wins.\' Never saw\r\nanything like it in all my life. He was three lengths a\'ead, and the\r\nothers were pulling off. \'Damn the boy; he\'ll win by twenty lengths,\' said\r\nthe Gaffer, without removing his glasses. But when within a few yards of\r\nthe stand----"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the bell rang. Mr. Leopold said, "There, they are wanting\r\ntheir tea; I must go and get it."\r\n\r\n"Drat their tea," said Margaret; "they can wait. Finish up; tell us how he\r\nwon."\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold looked round, and seeing every eye fixed on him he considered\r\nhow much remained of the story, and with quickened speech continued,\r\n"Well, approaching the stand, I noticed that Silver Braid was not going\r\nquite so fast, and at the very instant the Demon looked over his shoulder,\r\nand seeing he was losing ground he took up the whip. But the moment he\r\nstruck him the horse swerved right across the course, right under the\r\nstand, running like a rat from underneath the whip. The Demon caught him\r\none across the nose with his left hand, but seeing what was \'appening, the\r\nTinman, who was on Bullfinch, sat down and began riding. I felt as if\r\nthere was a lump of ice down my back," and Mr. Leopold lowered his voice,\r\nand his face became grave as he recalled that perilous moment. "I thought\r\nit was all over," he said, "and the Gaffer thought the same; I never saw a\r\nman go so deadly pale. It was all the work of a moment, but that moment\r\nwas more than a year--at least, so it seemed to me. Well, about half-way\r\nup the rails the Tinman got level with the Demon. It was ten to one that\r\nSilver Braid would turn it up, or that the boy wouldn\'t \'ave the strength\r\nto ride out so close a finish as it was bound to be. I thought then of the\r\nway you used to take him along from Portslade, and I\'d have given\r\nsomething to\'ve put a pound or two of flesh into his thighs and arms. The\r\nTinman was riding splendid, getting every ounce and something more out of\r\nBullfinch. The Demon, too weak to do much, was sitting nearly quite still.\r\nIt looked as if it was all up with us, but somehow Silver Braid took to\r\ngalloping of his own accord, and \'aving such a mighty lot in \'and he won\r\non the post by a \'ead--a short \'ead.... I never felt that queer in my life\r\nand the Gaffer was no better; but I said to him, just afore the numbers\r\nwent up, \'It is all right, sir, he\'s just done it,\' and when the right\r\nnumber went up I thought everything was on the dance, going for swim like.\r\nBy golly, it was a near thing!" At the end of a long silence Mr. Leopold\r\nsaid, shaking himself out of his thoughts, "Now I must go and get their\r\ntea."\r\n\r\nEsther sat at the end of the table; her cheek leaned on her hand. By\r\nturning her eyes she could see William. Sarah noticed one of these\r\nstealthy backward glances and a look of anger crossed her face, and\r\ncalling to William she asked him when the sweepstakes money would be\r\ndivided. The question startled William from a reverie of small bets, and\r\nhe answered that there was no reason why the sweepstakes money should not\r\nbe divided at once.\r\n\r\n"There was twelve. That\'s right, isn\'t it?--Sarah, Margaret, Esther, Miss\r\nGrover, Mr. Leopold, myself, the four boys, and Swindles and Wall....\r\nWell, it was agreed that seven should go to the first, three to the\r\nsecond, and two to the third. No one got the third \'orse, so I suppose the\r\ntwo shillings that would have gone to him \'ad better be given to the\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"Given to the first! Why, that\'s Esther! Why should she get it?... What do\r\nyou mean? No third! Wasn\'t Soap-bubble third?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Soap-bubble was third right enough, but he wasn\'t in the sweep."\r\n\r\n"And why wasn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Because he wasn\'t among the eleven first favourites. We took them as they\r\nwere quoted in the betting list published in the _Sportsman_."\r\n\r\n"How was it, then, that you put in Silver Braid?"\r\n\r\n"Yer needn\'t get so angry, Sarah, no one\'s cheating; it is all above\r\nboard. If you don\'t believe us, you\'d better accuse us straight out."\r\n\r\n"What I want to know is, why Silver Braid was included?--he wasn\'t among\r\nthe eleven first favourites."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be so stupid, Sarah; you know that we agreed to make an\r\nexception in favour of our own \'orse--a nice sweep it would \'ave been if\r\nwe \'adn\'t included Silver Braid."\r\n\r\n"And suppose," she exclaimed, tightening her brows, "that Soap-bubble had\r\nwon, what would have become of our money?"\r\n\r\n"It would have been returned--everyone would have got his shilling back."\r\n\r\n"And now I am to get three shillings, and that little Methodist or\r\nPlymouth Brethren there, whatever you like to call her, is to get nine!"\r\nsaid Sarah, with a light of inspiration flashing through her beer-clouded\r\nmind. "Why should the two shillings that would have gone to Soap-bubble,\r\nif anyone \'ad drawn \'im, go to the first \'orse rather than to the second?"\r\n\r\nWilliam hesitated, unable for the moment to give a good reason why the\r\nextra two shillings should be given to Silver Braid; and Sarah, perceiving\r\nher advantage, deliberately accused him of wishing to favour Esther.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t we know that you went out to walk with her, and that you remained\r\nout till nearly eleven at night. That\'s why you want all the money to go\r\nto her. You don\'t take us for a lot of fools, do you? Never in any place I\r\never was in before would such a thing be allowed--the footman going out\r\nwith the kitchen-maid, and one of the Dissenting lot."\r\n\r\n"I am not going to have my religion insulted! How dare you?" And Esther\r\nstarted up from her place; but William was too quick for her. He grasped\r\nher arm.\r\n\r\n"Never mind what Sarah says."\r\n\r\n"Never mind what I says! ...A thing like that, who never was in a\r\nsituation before; no doubt taken out of some \'ouse. Rescue work, I think\r\nthey call it----"\r\n\r\n"She shan\'t insult me--no, she shan\'t!" said Esther, tremulous with\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n"A nice sort of person to insult!" said Sarah, her arms akimbo.\r\n\r\n"Now look you here, Sarah Tucker," said Mrs. Latch, starting from her\r\nseat, "I\'m not going to see that girl aggravated, so that she may do what\r\nshe shouldn\'t do, and give you an opportunity of going to the missis with\r\ntales about her. Come away, Esther, come with me. Let them go on betting\r\nif they will; I never saw no good come of it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very fine, mother; but it must be settled, and we have to\r\ndivide the money."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want your money," said Esther, sullenly; "I wouldn\'t take it."\r\n\r\n"What blooming nonsense! You must take your money. Ah, here\'s Mr. Leopold!\r\nhe\'ll decide it."\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold said at once that the money that under other circumstances\r\nwould have gone to the third horse must be divided between the first and\r\nsecond; but Sarah refused to accept this decision. Finally, it was\r\nproposed that the matter should be referred to the editor of the\r\n_Sportsman_; and as Sarah still remained deaf to argument, William offered\r\nher choice between the _Sportsman_ and the _Sporting Life_.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said William, getting between the women; "this evening isn\'t\r\none for fighting; we have all won our little bit, and ought to be\r\nthankful. The only difference between you is two shillings, that were to\r\nhave gone to the third horse if anyone had drawn him. Mr. Leopold says it\r\nought to be divided; you, Sarah, won\'t accept his decision. We have\r\noffered to write to the _Sportsman_, and Esther has offered to give up her\r\nclaim. Now, in the name of God, tell us what do you want?"\r\n\r\nShe raised some wholly irrelevant issue, and after a protracted argument\r\nwith William, largely composed of insulting remarks, she declared that she\r\nwasn\'t going to take the two shillings, nor yet one of them; let them give\r\nher the three she had won--that was all she wanted. William looked at her,\r\nshrugged his shoulders, and, after declaring that it was his conviction\r\nthat women wasn\'t intended to have nothing to do with horse-racing, he\r\ntook up his pipe and tobacco-pouch.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, ladies, I have had enough of you for to-night; I am going to\r\nfinish my smoke in the pantry. Don\'t scratch all your \'air out; leave\r\nenough for me to put into a locket."\r\n\r\nWhen the pantry door was shut, and the men had smoked some moments in\r\nsilence, William said--\r\n\r\n"Do you think he has any chance of winning the Chesterfield Cup?"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll win in a canter if he\'ll only run straight. If I was the Gaffer I\r\nthink I\'d put up a bigger boy. He\'ll \'ave to carry a seven-pound penalty,\r\nand Johnnie Scott could ride that weight."\r\n\r\nThe likelihood that a horse will bolt with one jockey and run straight\r\nwith another was argued passionately, and illustrated with interesting\r\nreminiscences drawn from that remote past when Mr. Leopold was the\r\nGaffer\'s private servant--before either of them had married--when life was\r\ncomposed entirely of horse-racing and prize-fighting. But cutting short\r\nhis tale of how he had met one day the Birmingham Chicken in a booth, and,\r\nnot knowing who he was, had offered to fight him, Mr. Leopold confessed he\r\ndid not know how to act--he had a bet of fifty pounds to ten shillings for\r\nthe double event; should he stand it out or lay some of it off? William\r\nthrilled with admiration. What a \'ead, and who\'d think it? that little\r\n\'ead, hardly bigger than a cocoanut! What a brain there was inside! Fifty\r\npounds to ten shillings; should he stand it out or hedge some of it? Who\r\ncould tell better than Mr. Leopold? It would, of course, be a pity to\r\nbreak into the fifty. What did ten shillings matter? Mr. Leopold was a big\r\nenough man to stand the racket of it even if it didn\'t come back. William\r\nfelt very proud of being consulted, for Mr. Leopold had never before been\r\nknown to let anyone know what he had on a race.\r\n\r\nNext day they walked into Shoreham together. The bar of the "Red Lion" was\r\nfull of people. Above the thronging crowd the voice of the barman and the\r\ncustomers were heard calling, "Two glasses of Burton, glass of bitter,\r\nthree of whiskey cold." There were railway porters, sailors, boatmen,\r\nshop-boys, and market gardeners. They had all won something, and had come\r\nfor their winnings.\r\n\r\nOld Watkins, an elderly man with white whiskers and a curving stomach, had\r\njust run in to wet his whistle. He walked back to his office with Mr.\r\nLeopold and William, a little corner shelved out of some out-houses, into\r\nwhich you could walk from the street.\r\n\r\n"Talk of favourites!" he said; "I\'d sooner pay over the three first\r\nfavourites than this one--thirty, twenty to one starting price, and the\r\nwhole town onto him; it\'s enough to break any man.... Now, my men, what is\r\nit?" he said, turning to the railway porters.\r\n\r\n"Just the trifle me and my mates \'av won over that \'ere \'orse."\r\n\r\n"What was it?"\r\n\r\n"A shilling at five and twenty to one."\r\n\r\n"Look it out, Joey. Is it all right?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; yes, sir," said the clerk.\r\n\r\nAnd old Watkins slid his hand into his breeches pocket, and it came forth\r\nfilled with gold and silver.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, mates, we are bound to \'ave a bet on him for the\r\nChesterfield--we can afford it now; what say yer, a shilling each?"\r\n\r\n"Done for a shilling each," said the under-porter; "finest \'orse in\r\ntraining.... What price, Musser Watkins?"\r\n\r\n"Ten to one."\r\n\r\n"Right, \'ere\'s my bob."\r\n\r\nThe other porters gave their shillings; Watkins slid them back into his\r\npocket, and called to Joey to book the bet.\r\n\r\n"And, now, what is yours, Mr. Latch?"\r\n\r\nWilliam stated the various items. He had had a bet of ten shillings to one\r\non one race and had lost; he had had half-a-crown on another and had lost;\r\nin a word, three-and-sixpence had to be subtracted from his winnings on\r\nSilver Braid. These amounted to more than five pounds. William\'s face\r\nflushed with pleasure, and the world seemed to be his when he slipped four\r\nsovereigns and a handful of silver into his waistcoat pocket. Should he\r\nput a sovereign of his winnings on Silver Braid for the Chesterfield?\r\nHalf-a-sovereign was enough! ...The danger of risking a sovereign--a whole\r\nsovereign--frightened him.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Latch," said old Watkins, "if you want to back anything, make up\r\nyour mind; there are a good many besides yourself who have business with\r\nme."\r\n\r\nWilliam hesitated, and then said he\'d take ten half-sovereigns to one\r\nagainst Silver Braid.\r\n\r\n"Ten half-sovereigns to one?" said old Watkins.\r\n\r\nWilliam murmured "Yes," and Joey booked the bet.\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold\'s business demanded more consideration. The fat betting man\r\nand the scarecrow little butler walked aside and talked, both apparently\r\nindifferent to the impatience of a number of small customers; sometimes\r\nJoey called in his shrill cracked voice if he might lay ten half-crowns to\r\none, or five shillings to one, as the case might be. Watkins would then\r\nraise his eyes from Mr. Leopold\'s face and nod or shake his head, or\r\nperhaps would sign with his fingers what odds he was prepared to lay. With\r\nno one else would Watkins talk so lengthily, showing so much deference.\r\nMr. Leopold had the knack of investing all he did with an air of mystery,\r\nand the deepest interest was evinced in this conversation. At last, as if\r\ndismissing matters of first importance, the two men approached William,\r\nand he heard Watkins pressing Mr. Leopold to lay off some of that fifty\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take twelve to one--twenty-four pounds to two. Shall I book it?"\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold shook his head, and, smiling enigmatically, said he must be\r\ngetting back. William was much impressed, and congratulated himself on his\r\ncourage in taking the ten half-sovereigns to one. Mr. Leopold knew a thing\r\nor two; he had been talking to the Gaffer that morning, and if it hadn\'t\r\nbeen all right he would have laid off some of the money.\r\n\r\nNext day one of the Gaffer\'s two-year-olds won a race, and the day after\r\nSilver Braid won the Chesterfield Cup.\r\n\r\nThe second victory of Silver Braid nearly ruined old Watkins. He declared\r\nthat he had never been so hard hit; but as he did not ask for time and\r\ncontinued to draw notes and gold and silver in handfuls from his capacious\r\npockets, his lamentations only served to stimulate the happiness of the\r\nfortunate backers, and, listening to the sweet note of self ringing in\r\ntheir hearts, they returned to the public-house to drink the health of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nSo the flood of gold continued to roll into the little town, decrepit and\r\ncolourless by its high shingle beach and long reaches of muddy river. The\r\ndear gold jingled merrily in the pockets, quickening the steps, lightening\r\nthe heart, curling lips with smiles, opening lips with laughter. The dear\r\ngold came falling softly, sweetly as rain, soothing the hard lives of\r\nworking folk. Lives pressed with toil lifted up and began to dream again.\r\nThe dear gold was like an opiate; it wiped away memories of hardship and\r\nsorrow, it showed life in a lighter and merrier guise, and the folk\r\nlaughed at their fears for the morrow and wondered how they could have\r\nthought life so hard and relentless. The dear gold was pleasing as a bird\r\non the branch, as a flower on the stem; the tune it sang was sweet, the\r\ncolour it flaunted was bright.\r\n\r\nThe trade of former days had never brought the excitement and the fortune\r\nthat this horse\'s hoofs had done. The dust they had thrown up had fallen a\r\nhappy, golden shower upon Shoreham. In every corner and crevice of life\r\nthe glitter appeared. That fine red dress on the builder\'s wife, and the\r\nfeathers that the girls flaunt at their sweethearts, the loud trousers on\r\nthe young man\'s legs, the cigar in his mouth--all is Goodwood gold. It\r\nglitters in that girl\'s ears and on this girl\'s finger.\r\n\r\nIt was said that the town of Shoreham had won two thousand pounds on the\r\nrace; it was said that Mr. Leopold had won two hundred; it was said that\r\nWilliam Latch had won fifty; it was said that Wall, the coachman, had won\r\nfive-and-twenty; it was said that the Gaffer had won forty thousand\r\npounds. For ten miles around nothing was talked of but the wealth of the\r\nBarfields, and, drawn like moths to a candle, the county came to call;\r\neven the most distant and reserved left cards, others walked up and down\r\nthe lawn with the Gaffer, listening to his slightest word. A golden\r\nprosperity shone upon the yellow Italian house. Carriages passed under its\r\nelm-trees at every hour and swept round the evergreen oaks. Rumour said\r\nthat large alterations were going to be made, so that larger and grander\r\nentertainments might be given; an Italian garden was spoken of,\r\nbalustrades and terraces, stables were in course of construction, many\r\nmore race-horses were bought; they arrived daily, and the slender\r\ncreatures, their dark eyes glancing out of the sight holes in their cloth\r\nhoods, walked up from the station followed by an admiring and commenting\r\ncrowd. Drink and expensive living, dancing and singing upstairs and\r\ndownstairs, and the jollifications culminated in a servants\' ball given at\r\nthe Shoreham Gardens. All the Woodview servants, excepting Mrs. Latch,\r\nwere there; likewise all the servants from Mr. Northcote\'s, and those from\r\nSir George Preston\'s--two leading county families. A great number of\r\nservants had come from West Brighton, and Lancing, and Worthing\r\n--altogether between two and three hundred. "Evening dress is\r\nindispensable" was printed on the cards. The butlers, footmen, cooks,\r\nladies\' maids, housemaids, and housekeepers hoped by this notification to\r\nkeep the ball select. But the restriction seemed to condemn Esther to play\r\nagain the part of Cinderella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nA group of men turned from the circular buffet when Esther entered. Miss\r\nMary had given her a white muslin dress, a square-cut bodice with sleeves\r\nreaching to the elbows, and a blue sash tied round the waist. The remarks\r\nas she passed were, "A nice, pretty girl." William was waiting, and she\r\nwent away with him on the hop of a vigorous polka.\r\n\r\nMany of the dancers had gone to get cool in the gardens, but a few couples\r\nhad begun to whirl, the women borne along by force, the men poising their\r\nlegs into curious geometrical positions.\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold was very busy dragging men away from the circular buffet--they\r\nmust dance whether they knew how or not.\r\n\r\n"The Gaffer has told me partic\'lar to see that the \'gals\' all had\r\npartners, and just look down that \'ere room; \'alf of that lot \'aven\'t been\r\non their legs yet. \'Ere\'s a partner for you," and the butler pulled a\r\nyoung gamekeeper towards a young girl who had just arrived. She entered\r\nslowly, her hands clasped across her bosom, her eyes fixed on the ground,\r\nand the strangeness of the spectacle caused Mr. Leopold to pause. It was\r\nwhispered that she had never worn a low dress before, and Grover came to\r\nthe rescue of her modesty with a pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\nBut it had been found impossible to restrict the ball to those who\r\npossessed or could obtain an evening suit, and plenty of check trousers\r\nand red neckties were hopping about. Among the villagers many a touch\r\nsuggested costume. A young girl had borrowed her grandmother\'s wedding\r\ndress, and a young man wore a canary-coloured waistcoat and a blue\r\ncoastguardsman\'s coat of old time. These touches of fancy and personal\r\ntaste divided the villagers from the household servants. The butlers\r\nseemed on the watch for side dishes, and the valets suggested hair brushes\r\nand hot water. Cooks trailed black silk dresses adorned with wide collars,\r\nand fastened with gold brooches containing portraits of their late\r\nhusbands; and the fine shirt fronts set off with rich pearls, the\r\nlavender-gloved hands, the delicate faces, expressive of ease and leisure,\r\nmade Ginger\'s two friends--young Mr. Preston and young Mr. Northcote\r\n--noticeable among this menial, work-a-day crowd. Ginger loved the\r\nupper circles, and now he romped the polka in the most approved\r\nLondon fashion, his elbows advanced like a yacht\'s bowsprit, and, his\r\ncoat-tails flying, he dashed through a group of tradespeople who were\r\nbobbing up and down, hardly advancing at all.\r\n\r\nEsther was now being spoken of as the belle of the ball, she had danced\r\nwith young Mr. Preston, and seeing her sitting alone Grover called her and\r\nasked her why she was not dancing. Esther answered sullenly that she was\r\ntired.\r\n\r\n"Come, the next polka, just to show there is no ill-feeling." Half a dozen\r\ntimes William repeated his demand. At last she said--\r\n\r\n"You\'ve spoilt all my pleasure in the dancing."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry if I\'ve done that, Esther. I was jealous, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Jealous! What was you jealous for? What do it matter what people think,\r\nso long as I know I haven\'t done no wrong?"\r\n\r\nAnd in silence they walked into the garden. The night was warm, even\r\noppressive, and the moon hung like a balloon above the trees, and often\r\nthe straying revellers stopped to consider the markings now so plain upon\r\nits disc. There were arbours, artificial ruins, darkling pathways, and the\r\nbreathless garden was noisy in the illusive light. William showed Esther\r\nthe theatre and explained its purpose. She listened, though she did not\r\nunderstand, nor could she believe that she was not dreaming when they\r\nsuddenly stood on the borders of a beautiful lake full of the shadows of\r\ntall trees, and crossed by a wooden bridge at the narrowest end.\r\n\r\n"How still the water is; and the stars, they are lovely!"\r\n\r\n"You should see the gardens about three o\'clock on Saturday afternoons,\r\nwhen the excursion comes in from Brighton."\r\n\r\nThey walked on a little further, and Esther said, "What\'s these places?\r\nAin\'t they dark?"\r\n\r\n"These are arbours, where we \'as shrimps and tea. I\'ll take you next\r\nSaturday, if you\'ll come."\r\n\r\nA noisy band of young men, followed by three or four girls, ran across the\r\nbridge. Suddenly they stopped to argue on which side the boat was to be\r\nfound. Some chose the left, some the right; those who went to the right\r\nsent up a yell of triumph, and paddled into the middle of the water. They\r\nfirst addressed remarks to their companions, and then they admired the\r\nmoon and stars. A song was demanded, and at the end of the second verse\r\nWilliam threw his arm round Esther.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Esther, I do love you."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, her grey eyes fixed in a long interrogation.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if that is true. What is there to love in me?"\r\n\r\nHe squeezed her tightly, and continued his protestations. "I do, I do, I\r\ndo love you, Esther."\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, and they walked slowly on. A holly bush threw a black\r\nshadow on the gravel path and a moment after the ornamental tin roof of\r\nthe dancing room appeared between the trees.\r\n\r\nEven in their short absence a change had come upon the ball. About the\r\ncircular buffet numbers of men called for drink, and talked loudly of\r\nhorse-racing. Many were away at supper, and those that remained were\r\namusing themselves in a desultory fashion. A tall, lean woman, dressed\r\nlike Sarah in white muslin, wearing amber beads round her neck, was\r\ndancing the lancers with the Demon, and everyone shook with laughter when\r\nshe whirled the little fellow round or took him in her arms and carried\r\nhim across. William wanted to dance, but Esther was hungry, and led him\r\naway to an adjoining building where cold beef, chicken, and beer might be\r\nhad by the strong and adventurous. As they struggled through the crowd\r\nEsther spied three young gentlemen at the other end of the room.\r\n\r\n"Now tell me, if they ask me, the young gents yonder, to dance, am I to\r\nlook them straight in the face and say no?"\r\n\r\nWilliam considered a moment, and then he said, "I think you had better\r\ndance with them if they asks you; if you refuse, Sarah will say it was I\r\nwho put you up to it."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s have another bottle," cried Ginger. "Come, what do you say, Mr.\r\nThomas?"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas coughed, smiled, and said that Mr. Arthur wished to see him in\r\nthe hands of the police. However, he promised to drink his share. Two more\r\nbottles were sent for, and, stimulated by the wine, the weights that would\r\nprobably be assigned to certain horses in the autumn handicap were\r\ndiscussed. William was very proud of being admitted into such company, and\r\nhe listened, a cigar which he did not like between his teeth, and a glass\r\nof champagne in his hand.... Suddenly the conversation was interrupted by\r\nthe cornet sounding the first phrase of a favourite waltz, and the tipsy\r\nand the sober hastened away.\r\n\r\nNeither Esther nor William knew how to waltz, but they tumbled round the\r\nroom, enjoying themselves immensely. In the polka and mazurka they got on\r\nbetter; and there were quadrilles and lancers in which the gentlemen\r\njoined, and all were gay and pleasant; even Sarah\'s usually sour face\r\nglowed with cordiality when they joined hands and raced round the men\r\nstanding in the middle. In the chain they lost themselves as in a\r\nlabyrinth and found their partners unexpectedly. But the dance of the\r\nevening was Sir Roger de Coverley, and Esther\'s usually sober little brain\r\nevaporated in the folly of running up the room, then turning and running\r\nbackwards, getting into her place as best she could, and then starting\r\nagain. It always appeared to be her turn, and it was so sweet to see her\r\ndear William, and such a strange excitement to run forward to meet young\r\nMr. Preston, to curtsey to him, and then run away; and this over and over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"There\'s the dawn."\r\n\r\nEsther looked, and in the whitening doorways she saw the little jockey\r\nstaggering about helplessly drunk. The smile died out of her eyes; she\r\nreturned to her true self, to Mrs. Barfield and the Brethren. She felt\r\nthat all this dancing, drinking, and kissing in the arbours was wicked.\r\nBut Miss Mary had sent for her, and had told her that she would give her\r\none of her dresses, and she had not known how to refuse Miss Mary. Then,\r\nif she had not gone, William--Sounds of loud voices were heard in the\r\ngarden, and the lean woman in the white muslin repeated some charge.\r\nEsther ran out to see what was happening, and there she witnessed a\r\ndisgraceful scene. The lean woman in the muslin dress and the amber beads\r\naccused young Mr. Preston of something which he denied, and she heard\r\nWilliam tell someone that he was mistaken, that he and his pals didn\'t\r\nwant no rowing at this \'ere ball, and what was more they didn\'t mean to\r\nhave none.\r\n\r\nAnd her heart filled with love for her big William. What a fine fellow he\r\nwas! how handsome were his shoulders beside that round-shouldered little\r\nman whom he so easily pulled aside! and having crushed out the quarrel, he\r\nhelped her on with her jacket, and, hanging on his arm, they returned home\r\nthrough the little town. Margaret followed with the railway porter; Sarah\r\nwas with her faithful admirer, a man with a red beard, whom she had picked\r\nup at the ball; Grover waddled in the rear, embarrassed with the green\r\nsilk, which she held high out of the dust of the road.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the station the sky was stained with rose, and the\r\nbarren downs--more tin-like than ever in the shadow-less light of\r\ndawn--stretched across the sunrise from Lancing to Brighton. The little\r\nbirds sat ruffling their feathers, and, awaking to the responsibilities of\r\nthe day, flew away into the corn. The night had been close and sultry, and\r\neven at this hour there was hardly any freshness in the air. Esther looked\r\nat the hills, examining the landscape intently. She was thinking of the\r\nfirst time she saw it. Some vague association of ideas--the likeness that\r\nthe morning landscape bore to the evening landscape, or the wish to\r\nprolong the sweetness of these, the last moments of her happiness,\r\nimpelled her to linger and to ask William if the woods and fields were not\r\nbeautiful. The too familiar landscape awoke in William neither idea nor\r\nsensation; Esther interested him more, and while she gazed dreamily on the\r\nhills he admired the white curve of her neck which showed beneath the\r\nunbuttoned jacket. She never looked prettier than she did that morning,\r\nstanding on the dusty road, her white dress crumpled, the ends of the blue\r\nsash hanging beneath the black cloth jacket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nFor days nothing was talked of but the ball--how this man had danced, the\r\nbad taste of this woman\'s dress, and the possibility of a marriage. The\r\nball had brought amusement to all, to Esther it had brought happiness. Her\r\nhappiness was now visible in her face and audible in her voice, and\r\nSarah\'s ironical allusions to her inability to learn to read no longer\r\nannoyed her, no longer stirred her temper--her love seemed to induce\r\nforgiveness for all and love for everything.\r\n\r\nIn the evenings when their work was done Esther and her lover lingered\r\nabout the farm buildings, listening to the rooks, seeing the lights die in\r\nthe west; and in the summer darkness about nine she tripped by his side\r\nwhen he took the letters to post. The wheat stacks were thatching, and in\r\nthe rickyard, in the carpenter\'s shop, and in the whist of the woods they\r\ntalked of love and marriage. They lay together in the warm valleys,\r\nlistening to the tinkling of the sheep-bell, and one evening, putting his\r\npipe aside, William threw his arm round her, whispering that she was his\r\nwife. The words were delicious in her fainting ears, and her will died in\r\nwhat seemed like irresistible destiny. She could not struggle with him,\r\nthough she knew that her fate depended upon her resistance, and swooning\r\naway she awakened in pain, powerless to free herself.... Soon after\r\nthoughts betook themselves on their painful way, and the stars were\r\nshining when he followed her across the down, beseeching her to listen.\r\nBut she fled along the grey road and up the stairs to her room. Margaret\r\nwas in bed, and awakening a little asked her what had kept her out so\r\nlate. She did not answer... and hearing Margaret fall asleep she\r\nremembered the supper-table. Sarah, who had come in late, had sat down by\r\nher; William sat on the opposite side; Mrs. Latch was in her place, the\r\njockeys were all together; Mr. Swindles, his snuff-box on the table;\r\nMargaret and Grover. Everyone had drunk a great deal; and Mr. Leopold had\r\ngone to the beer cellar many times. She thought that she remembered\r\nfeeling a little dizzy when William asked her to come for a stroll up the\r\nhill. They had passed through the hunting gate; they had wandered into the\r\nloneliness of the hills. Over the folded sheep the rooks came home noisily\r\nthrough a deepening sky. So far she remembered, and she could not remember\r\nfurther; and all night lay staring into the darkness, and when Margaret\r\ncalled her in the morning she was pale and deathlike.\r\n\r\n"Whatever is the matter? You do look ill."\r\n\r\n"I did not sleep all last night. My head aches as if it would drop off. I\r\ndon\'t feel as if I could go to work to-day."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the worst of being a servant. Well or ill, it makes no matter."\r\nShe turned from the glass, and holding her hair in her left hand, leaned\r\nher head so that she might pin it. "You do look bad," she remarked dryly.\r\n\r\nNever had they been so late! Half-past seven, and the shutters still up!\r\nSo said Margaret as they hurried downstairs. But Esther thought only of\r\nthe meeting with William. She had seen him cleaning boots in the pantry as\r\nthey passed. He waited till Margaret left her, till he heard the baize\r\ndoor which separated the back premises from the front of the house close,\r\nthen he ran to the kitchen, where he expected to find Esther alone. But\r\nmeeting his mother he mumbled some excuse and retreated. There were\r\nvisitors in the house, he had a good deal to do that morning, and Esther\r\nkept close to Mrs. Latch; but at breakfast it suddenly became necessary\r\nthat she should answer him, and Sarah saw that Esther and William were no\r\nlonger friends.\r\n\r\n"Well I never! Look at her! She sits there over her tea-cup as melancholy\r\nas a prayer-meeting."\r\n\r\n"What is it to you?" said William.\r\n\r\n"What\'s it to me? I don\'t like an ugly face at the breakfast-table, that\'s\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t be your looking-glass, then. Luckily there isn\'t one here."\r\n\r\nIn the midst of an angry altercation, Esther walked out of the room.\r\nDuring dinner she hardly spoke at all. After dinner she went to her room,\r\nand did not come down until she thought he had gone out with the carriage.\r\nBut she was too soon, William came running down the passage to meet her.\r\nHe laid his hand supplicatingly on her arm.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t touch me!" she said, and her eyes filled with dangerous light.\r\n\r\n"Now, Esther! ...Come, don\'t lay it on too thick!"\r\n\r\n"Go away. Don\'t speak to me!"\r\n\r\n"Just listen one moment, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Go away. If you don\'t, I\'ll go straight to Mrs. Barfield."\r\n\r\nShe passed into the kitchen and shut the door in his face. He had gone a\r\ntrifle pale, and after lingering a few moments he hurried away to the\r\nstables, and Esther saw him spring on the box.\r\n\r\nAs it was frequent with Esther not to speak to anyone with whom she had\r\nhad a dispute for a week or fifteen days, her continued sulk excited\r\nlittle suspicion, and the cause of the quarrel was attributed to some\r\ntrifle. Sarah said--\r\n\r\n"Men are such fools. He is always begging of her to forgive him. Just look\r\nat him--he is still after her, following her into the wood-shed."\r\n\r\nShe rarely answered him a yes or no, but would push past him, and if he\r\nforcibly barred the way she would say, "Let me go by, will you? You are\r\ninterfering with my work." And if he still insisted, she spoke of\r\nappealing to Mrs. Barfield. And if her heart sometimes softened, and an\r\ninsidious thought whispered that it did not matter since they were going\r\nto be married, instinct forced her to repel him; her instinct was that she\r\ncould only win his respect by refusing forgiveness for a long while. The\r\nreligion in which her soul moved and lived--the sternest\r\nProtestantism--strengthened and enforced the original convictions and the\r\nprejudices of her race; and the natural shame which she had first felt\r\nalmost disappeared in the violence of her virtue. She even ceased to fear\r\ndiscovery. What did it matter who knew, since she knew? She opened her\r\nheart to God. Christ looked down, but he seemed stern and unforgiving. Her\r\nChrist was the Christ of her forefathers; and He had not forgiven, because\r\nshe could not forgive herself. Hers was the unpardonable sin, the sin\r\nwhich her race had elected to fight against, and she lay down weary and\r\nsullen at heart.\r\n\r\nThe days seemed to bring no change, and wearied by her stubbornness,\r\nWilliam said, "Let her sulk," and he went out with Sarah; and when Esther\r\nsaw them go down the yard her heart said, "Let him take her out, I don\'t\r\nwant him." For she knew it to be a trick to make her jealous, and that he\r\nshould dare such a trick angered her still further against him, and when\r\nthey met in the garden, where she had gone with some food for the cats,\r\nand he said, "Forgive me, Esther, I only went out with Sarah because you\r\ndrove me wild," she closed her teeth and refused to answer. But he stood\r\nin her path, determined not to leave her. "I am very fond of you, Esther,\r\nand I will marry you as soon as I have earned enough or won enough money\r\nto give you a comfortable \'ome."\r\n\r\n"You are a wicked man; I will never marry you."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry, Esther. But I am not as bad as you think for. You let\r\nyour temper get the better of you. So soon as I have got a bit of money\r\ntogether--"\r\n\r\n"If you were a good man you would ask me to marry you now."\r\n\r\n"I will if you like, but the truth is that I have only three pounds in the\r\nworld. I have been unlucky lately--"\r\n\r\n"You think of nothing but that wicked betting. Come, let me pass; I\'m not\r\ngoing to listen to a lot of lies."\r\n\r\n"After the Leger--"\r\n\r\n"Let me pass. I will not speak to you."\r\n\r\n"But look here, Esther: marriage or no marriage, we can\'t go on in this\r\nway: they\'ll be suspecting something shortly."\r\n\r\n"I shall leave Woodview." She had hardly spoken the words when it seemed\r\nclear to her that she must leave, and the sooner the better. "Come, let me\r\npass.... If Mrs. Barfield--"\r\n\r\nAn angry look passed over William\'s face, and he said--\r\n\r\n"I want to act honest with you, and you won\'t let me. If ever there was a\r\nsulky pig! ...Sarah\'s quite right; you are just the sort that would make\r\nhell of a man\'s life."\r\n\r\nShe was bound to make him respect her. She had vaguely felt from the\r\nbeginning that this was her only hope, and now the sensation developed and\r\ndefined itself into a thought and she decided that she would not yield,\r\nbut would continue to affirm her belief that he must acknowledge his sin,\r\nand then come and ask her to marry him. Above all things, Esther desired\r\nto see William repentant. Her natural piety, filling as it did her entire\r\nlife, unconsciously made her deem repentance an essential condition of\r\ntheir happiness. How could they be happy if he were not a God-fearing man?\r\nThis question presented itself constantly, and she was suddenly convinced\r\nthat she could not marry him until he had asked forgiveness of the Lord.\r\nThen they would be joined together, and would love each other faithfully\r\nunto death.\r\n\r\nBut in conflict with her prejudices, her natural love of the man was as\r\nthe sun shining above a fog-laden valley; rays of passion pierced her\r\nstubborn nature, dissolving it, and unconsciously her eyes sought\r\nWilliam\'s, and unconsciously her steps strayed from the kitchen when her\r\nears told her he was in the passage. But when her love went out freely to\r\nWilliam, when she longed to throw herself in his arms, saying, "Yes, I\r\nlove you; make me your wife," she noticed, or thought she noticed, that he\r\navoided her eyes, and she felt that thoughts of which she knew nothing had\r\nobtained a footing in his mind, and she was full of foreboding.\r\n\r\nHer heart being intent on him, she was aware of much that escaped the\r\nordinary eye, and she was the first to notice when the drawing-room bell\r\nrang, and Mr. Leopold rose, that William would say, "My legs are the\r\nyoungest, don\'t you stir."\r\n\r\nNo one else, not even Sarah, thought William intended more than to keep in\r\nMr. Leopold\'s good graces, but Esther, although unable to guess the truth,\r\nheard the still tinkling bell ringing the knell of her hopes. She noted,\r\ntoo, the time he remained upstairs, and asked herself anxiously what it\r\nwas that detained him so long. The weather had turned colder lately....\r\nWas it a fire that was wanted? In the course of the afternoon, she heard\r\nfrom Margaret that Miss Mary and Mrs. Barfield had gone to Southwick to\r\nmake a call, and she heard from one of the boys that the Gaffer and Ginger\r\nhad ridden over in the morning to Fendon Fair, and had not yet returned.\r\nIt must have been Peggy who had rung the bell. Peggy? Suddenly she\r\nremembered something--something that had been forgotten. The first Sunday,\r\nthe first time she went to the library for family prayers, Peggy was\r\nsitting on the little green sofa, and as Esther passed across the room to\r\nher place she saw her cast a glance of admiration on William\'s tall\r\nfigure, and the memory of that glance had flamed up in her brain, and all\r\nthat night Esther saw the girl with the pale face and the coal-black hair\r\nlooking at her William.\r\n\r\nNext day Esther waited for the bell that was to call her lover from her.\r\nThe afternoon wore slowly away, and she had begun to hope she was mistaken\r\nwhen the metal tongue commenced calling. She heard the baize door close\r\nbehind him; but the bell still continued to utter little pathetic notes. A\r\nmoment after all was still in the corridor, and like one sunk to the knees\r\nin quicksands she felt that the time had come for a decided effort. But\r\nwhat could she do? She could not follow him to the drawing-room. She had\r\nbegun to notice that he seemed to avoid her, and by his conduct seemed to\r\nwish that their quarrel might endure. But pride and temper had fallen from\r\nher, and she lived conscious of him, noting every sign, and intensely, all\r\nthat related to him, divining all his intentions, and meeting him in the\r\npassage when he least expected her.\r\n\r\n"I\'m always getting in your way," she said, with a low, nervous laugh.\r\n\r\n"No harm in that; ...fellow servants; there must be give and take."\r\n\r\nTremblingly they looked at each other, feeling that the time had come,\r\nthat an explanation was inevitable, but at that moment the drawing-room\r\nbell rang above their heads, and William said, "I must answer that bell."\r\nHe turned from her, and passed through the baize door before she had said\r\nanother word.\r\n\r\nSarah remarked that William seemed to spend a great deal of his time in\r\nthe drawing-room, and Esther started out of her moody contemplation, and,\r\nspeaking instinctively, she said, "I don\'t think much of ladies who go\r\nafter their servants."\r\n\r\nEveryone looked up. Mrs. Latch laid her carving-knife on the meat and\r\nfixed her eyes on her son.\r\n\r\n"Lady?" said Sarah; "she\'s no lady! Her mother used to mop out the yard\r\nbefore she was \'churched.\'"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you what," said William, "you had better mind what you are\r\na-saying of, for if any of your talk got wind upstairs you\'d lose yer\r\nsituation, and it might be some time before yer got another!"\r\n\r\n"Lose my situation! and a good job, too. I shall always be able to suit\r\nmesel\'; don\'t you fear about me. But if it comes to talking about\r\nsituations, I can tell you that you are more likely to lose yours than I\r\nam to lose mine."\r\n\r\nWilliam hesitated, and while he sought a judicious reply Mrs. Latch and\r\nMr. Leopold, putting forth their joint authority, brought the discussion\r\nto a close. The jockey-boys exchanged grins, Sarah sulked, Mr. Swindles\r\npursed up his mouth in consideration, and the elder servants felt that the\r\nmatter would not rest in the servant\'s hall; that evening it would be the\r\ntheme of conversation in the "Red Lion," and the next day it would be the\r\ntalk of the town.\r\n\r\nAbout four o\'clock Esther saw Mrs. Barfield, Miss Mary, and Peggy walk\r\nacross the yard towards the garden, and as Esther had to go soon after to\r\nthe wood-shed she saw Peggy slip out of the garden by a bottom gate and\r\nmake her way through the evergreens. Esther hastened back to the kitchen\r\nand stood waiting for the bell to ring. She had not to wait long; the bell\r\ntinkled, but so faintly that Esther said, "She only just touched it; it is\r\na signal; he was on the look-out for it; she did not want anyone else to\r\nhear."\r\n\r\nEsther remembered the thousands of pounds she had heard that the young\r\nlady possessed, and the beautiful dresses she wore. There was no hope for\r\nher. How could there be? Her poor little wages and her print dress! He\r\nwould never look at her again! But oh! how cruel and wicked it was! How\r\ncould one who had so much come to steal from one who had so little? Oh, it\r\nwas very cruel and very wicked, and no good would come of it either to her\r\nor to him; of that she felt quite sure. God always punished the wicked.\r\nShe knew he did not love Peggy. It was sin and shame; and after his\r\npromises--after what had happened. Never would she have believed him to be\r\nso false. Then her thought turned to passionate hatred of the girl who had\r\nso cruelly robbed her. He had gone through that baize door, and no doubt\r\nhe was sitting by Peggy in the new drawing-room. He had gone where she\r\ncould not follow. He had gone where the grand folk lived in idleness, in\r\nthe sinfulness of the world and the flesh, eating and gambling, thinking\r\nof nothing else, and with servants to wait on them, obeying their orders\r\nand saving them from every trouble. She knew that these fine folk thought\r\nservants inferior beings. But was she not of the same flesh and blood as\r\nthey? Peggy wore a fine dress, but she was no better; take off her dress\r\nand they were the same, woman to woman.\r\n\r\nShe pushed through the door and walked down the passage. A few steps\r\nbrought her to the foot of a polished oak staircase, lit by a large window\r\nin coloured glass, on either side of which there were statues. The\r\nstaircase sloped slowly to an imposing landing set out with columns and\r\nblue vases and embroidered curtains. The girl saw these things vaguely,\r\nand she was conscious of a profusion of rugs, matting, and bright doors,\r\nand of her inability to decide which door was the drawing-room door--the\r\ndrawing-room of which she had heard so much, and where even now, amid gold\r\nfurniture and sweet-scented air, William listened to the wicked woman who\r\nhad tempted him away from her. Suddenly William appeared, and seeing\r\nEsther he seemed uncertain whether to draw back or come forward. Then his\r\nface took an expression of mixed fear and anger; and coming rapidly\r\ntowards her, he said--\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here?"... then changing his voice, "This is against\r\nthe rules of the \'ouse."\r\n\r\n"I want to see her."\r\n\r\n"Anything else? What do you want to say to her? I won\'t have it, I tell\r\nyou.... What do you mean by spying after me? That\'s your game, is it?"\r\n\r\n"I want to speak to her."\r\n\r\nWith averted face the young lady fled up the oak staircase, her\r\nhandkerchief to her lips. Esther made a movement as if to follow, but\r\nWilliam prevented her. She turned and walked down the passage and entered\r\nthe kitchen. Her face was one white tint, her short, strong arms hung\r\ntremblingly, and William saw that it would be better to temporise.\r\n\r\n"Now look here, Esther," he said, "you ought to be damned thankful to me\r\nfor having prevented you from making a fool of yourself."\r\n\r\nEsther\'s eyelids quivered, and then her eyes dilated.\r\n\r\n"Now, if Miss Margaret," continued William, "had--"\r\n\r\n"Go away! go away! I am--" At that moment the steel of a large,\r\nsharp-pointed knife lying on the table caught her eye. She snatched it up,\r\nand seeing blood she rushed at him.\r\n\r\nWilliam retreated from her, and Mrs. Latch, coming suddenly in, caught her\r\narm. Esther threw the knife; it struck the wall, falling with a rattle on\r\nthe meat screen. Escaping from Mrs. Latch, she rushed to secure it, but\r\nher strength gave way, and she fell back in a dead faint.\r\n\r\n"What have you been doing to the girl?" said Mrs. Latch.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, mother.... We had a few words, that was all. She said I should\r\nnot go out with Sarah."\r\n\r\n"That is not true.... I can read the lie in your face; a girl doesn\'t take\r\nup a knife unless a man well-nigh drives her mad."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right; always side against your son! ...If you don\'t believe me,\r\nget what you can out of her yourself." And, turning on his heel, he walked\r\nout of the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Latch saw him pass down the yard towards the stables, and when Esther\r\nopened her eyes she looked at Mrs. Latch questioningly, unable to\r\nunderstand why the old woman was standing by her.\r\n\r\n"Are you better now, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but--but what--" Then remembrance struggled back. "Is he gone? Did I\r\nstrike him? I remember that I--"\r\n\r\n"You did not hurt him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to see him again. Far better not. I was mad. I did not know\r\nwhat I was doing."\r\n\r\n"You will tell me about it another time, dear."\r\n\r\n"Where is he? tell me that; I must know."\r\n\r\n"Gone to the stables, I think; but you must not go after him--you\'ll see\r\nhim to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I do not want to go after him; but he isn\'t hurt? That\'s what I want to\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"No, he isn\'t hurt.... You\'re getting stronger.... Lean on me. You\'ll\r\nbegin to feel better when you are in bed. I\'ll bring you up your tea."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall be all right presently. But how\'ll you manage to get the\r\ndinner?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you worry about that; you go upstairs and lie down."\r\n\r\nA desolate hope floated over the surface of her brain that William might\r\nbe brought back to her.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the kitchen was full of people: Margaret, Sarah, and Grover\r\nwere there, and she heard that immediately after lunch Mr. Leopold had\r\nbeen sent for, and the Gaffer had instructed him to pay William a month\'s\r\nwages, and see that he left the house that very instant. Sarah, Margaret,\r\nand Grover watched Esther\'s face and were surprised at her indifference.\r\nShe even seemed pleased. She was pleased; nothing better could have\r\nhappened. William was now separated from her rival, and released from her\r\nbad influence he would return to his real love. At the first sign she\r\nwould go to him, she would forgive him. But a little later, when the\r\ndishes came down from the dining-room, it was whispered that Peggy was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening, when the servants were going to bed, it became known\r\nthat she had left the house, that she had taken the six o\'clock to\r\nBrighton. Esther turned from the foot of the stair with a wild look.\r\nMargaret caught her.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no use, dear; you can do nothing to-night."\r\n\r\n"I can walk to Brighton."\r\n\r\n"No, you can\'t; you don\'t know the way, and even if you did you don\'t know\r\nwhere they are."\r\n\r\nNeither Sarah nor Grover made any remark, and in silence the servants went\r\nto their rooms. Margaret closed the door and turned to look at Esther, who\r\nhad fallen on the chair, her eyes fixed in vacancy.\r\n\r\n"I know what it is; I was the same when Jim Story got the sack. It seems\r\nas if one couldn\'t live through it, and yet one does somehow."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if they\'ll marry."\r\n\r\n"Most probable. She has a lot of money."\r\n\r\nTwo days after a cab stood in the yard in front of the kitchen window.\r\nPeggy\'s luggage was being piled upon it--two large, handsome basket boxes\r\nwith the initials painted on them. Kneeling on the box-seat, the coachman\r\nleaned over the roof making room for another--a small box covered with red\r\ncowhide and tied with a rough rope. The little box in its poor simplicity\r\nbrought William back to Esther, whelming her for a moment in so acute a\r\nsense of her loss that she had to leave the kitchen. She went into the\r\nscullery, drew the door after her, sat down, and hid her face in her\r\napron. A stifled sob or two, and then she recovered her habitual gravity\r\nof expression, and continued her work as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\n"They are just crazy about it upstairs. Ginger and the Gaffer are the\r\nworst. They say they had better sell the place and build another house\r\nsomewhere else. None of the county people will call on them now--and just\r\nas they were beginning to get on so well! Miss Mary, too, is terrible cut\r\nup about it; she says it will interfere with her prospects, and that\r\nGinger has nothing to do now but to marry the kitchen-maid to complete the\r\nruin of the Barfields."\r\n\r\n"Miss Mary is far too kind to say anything to wound another\'s feelings. It\r\nis only a nasty old deceitful thing like yourself who could think of such\r\na thing."\r\n\r\n"Eh, you got it there, my lady," said Sarah, who had had a difference with\r\nGrover, and was anxious to avenge it.\r\n\r\nGrover looked at Sarah in astonishment, and her look clearly said, "Is\r\neveryone going to side with that little kitchen-maid?"\r\n\r\nThen, to flatter Mrs. Latch, Sarah spoke of the position the Latches had\r\nheld three generations ago; the Barfields were then nobodies; they had\r\nnothing even now but their money, and that had come out of a livery\r\nstable. "And it shows, too; just compare Ginger with young Preston or\r\nyoung Northcote. Anyone could tell the difference."\r\n\r\nEsther listened with an unmoved face and a heavy ache in her heart. She\r\nhad now not an enemy nor yet an opponent; the cause of rivalry and\r\njealousy being removed, all were sorry for her. They recognised that she\r\nhad suffered and was suffering, and seeing none but friends about her, she\r\nwas led to think how happy she might have been in this beautiful house if\r\nit had not been for William. She loved her work, for she was working for\r\nthose she loved. She could imagine no life happier than hers might have\r\nbeen. But she had sinned, and the Lord had punished her for sin, and she\r\nmust bear her punishment uncomplainingly, giving Him thanks that He had\r\nimposed no heavier one upon her.\r\n\r\nSuch reflection was the substance of Esther\'s mind for three months after\r\nWilliam\'s departure; and in the afternoons, about three o\'clock, when her\r\nwork paused, Esther\'s thoughts would congregate and settle on the great\r\nmisfortune of her life--William\'s desertion.\r\n\r\nIt was one afternoon at the beginning of December; Mrs. Latch had gone\r\nupstairs to lie down. Esther had drawn her chair towards the fire. A\r\nbroken-down race-horse, his legs bandaged from his knees to his fetlocks,\r\nhad passed up the yard; he was going for walking exercise on the downs,\r\nand when the sound of his hoofs had died away Esther was quite alone. She\r\nsat on her wooden chair facing the wide kitchen window. She had advanced\r\none foot on the iron fender; her head leaned back, rested on her hand. She\r\ndid not think--her mind was lost in vague sensation of William, and it was\r\nin this death of active memory that something awoke within her, something\r\nthat seemed to her like a flutter of wings; her heart seemed to drop from\r\nits socket, and she nearly fainted away, but recovering herself she stood\r\nby the kitchen table, her arms drawn back and pressed to her sides, a\r\ndeath-like pallor over her face, and drops of sweat on her forehead. The\r\ntruth was borne in upon her; she realised in a moment part of the awful\r\ndrama that awaited her, and from which nothing could free her, and which\r\nshe would have to live through hour by hour. So dreadful did it seem, that\r\nshe thought her brain must give way. She would have to leave Woodview. Oh,\r\nthe shame of confession! Mrs. Barfield, who had been so good to her, and\r\nwho thought so highly of her. Her father would not have her at home; she\r\nwould be homeless in London. No hope of obtaining a situation.... they\r\nwould send her away without a character, homeless in London, and every\r\nmonth her position growing more desperate....\r\n\r\nA sickly faintness crept up through her. The flesh had come to the relief\r\nof the spirit; and she sank upon her chair, almost unconscious, sick, it\r\nseemed, to death, and she rose from the chair wiping her forehead slowly\r\nwith her apron.... She might be mistaken. And she hid her face in her\r\nhands, and then, falling on her knees, her arms thrown forward upon the\r\ntable, she prayed for strength to walk without flinching under any cross\r\nthat He had thought fit to lay upon her.\r\n\r\nThere was still the hope that she might be mistaken; and this hope lasted\r\nfor one week, for two, but at the end of the third week it perished, and\r\nshe abandoned herself in prayer. She prayed for strength to endure with\r\ncourage what she now knew she must endure, and she prayed for light to\r\nguide her in her present decision. Mrs. Barfield, however much she might\r\npity her, could not keep her once she knew the truth, whereas none might\r\nknow the truth if she did not tell it. She might remain at Woodview\r\nearning another quarter\'s wages; the first she had spent on boots and\r\nclothes, the second she had just been paid. If she stayed on for another\r\nquarter she would have eight pounds, and with that money, and much less\r\ntime to keep herself, she might be able to pull through. But would she be\r\nable to go undetected for nearly three whole months, until her next wages\r\ncame due? She must risk it.\r\n\r\nThree months of constant fear and agonising suspense wore away, and no\r\none, not even Margaret, suspected Esther\'s condition. Encouraged by her\r\nsuccess, and seeing still very little sign of change in her person, and as\r\nevery penny she could earn was of vital consequence in the coming time,\r\nEsther determined to risk another month; then she would give notice and\r\nleave. Another month passed, and Esther was preparing for departure when a\r\nwhisper went round, and before she could take steps to leave she was told\r\nthat Mrs. Barfield wished to see her in the library. Esther turned a\r\nlittle pale, and the expression of her face altered; it seemed to her\r\nimpossible to go before Mrs. Barfield and admit her shame. Margaret, who\r\nwas standing near and saw what was passing in her mind, said--\r\n\r\n"Pull yourself together, Esther. You know the Saint--she\'s not a bad sort.\r\nLike all the real good ones, she is kind enough to the faults of others."\r\n\r\n"What\'s this? What\'s the matter with Esther?" said Mrs. Latch, who had not\r\nyet heard of Esther\'s misfortune.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you presently, Mrs. Latch. Go, dear, get it over."\r\n\r\nEsther hurried down the passage and passed through the baize door without\r\nfurther thought. She had then but to turn to the left and a few steps\r\nwould bring her to the library door. The room was already present in her\r\nmind. She could see it. The dim light, the little green sofa, the round\r\ntable covered with books, the piano at the back, the parrot in the corner,\r\nand the canaries in the window. She knocked at the door. The well-known\r\nvoice said, "Come in." She turned the handle, and found herself alone with\r\nher mistress. Mrs. Barfield laid down the book she was reading, and looked\r\nup. She did not look as angry as Esther had imagined, but her voice was\r\nharder than usual.\r\n\r\n"Is this true, Esther?"\r\n\r\nEsther hung down her head. She could not speak at first; then she said,\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I thought you were a good girl, Esther."\r\n\r\n"So did I, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield looked at the girl quickly, hesitated a moment, and then\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"And all this time--how long is it?"\r\n\r\n"Nearly seven months, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"And all this time you were deceiving us."\r\n\r\n"I was three months gone before I knew it myself, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Three months! Then for three months you have knelt every Sunday in prayer\r\nin this room, for twelve Sundays you sat by me learning to read, and you\r\nnever said a word?"\r\n\r\nA certain harshness in Mrs. Barfield\'s voice awakened a rebellious spirit\r\nin Esther, and a lowering expression gathered above her eyes. She said--\r\n\r\n"Had I told you, you would have sent me away then and there. I had only a\r\nquarter\'s wages, and should have starved or gone and drowned myself."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to hear you speak like that, Esther."\r\n\r\n"It is trouble that makes me, ma\'am, and I have had a great deal."\r\n\r\n"Why did you not confide in me? I have not shown myself cruel to you, have\r\nI?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, ma\'am. You are the best mistress a servant ever had, but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, ma\'am, it is this way.... I hated being deceitful--indeed I did. But\r\nI can no longer think of myself. There is another to think for now."\r\n\r\nThere was in Mrs. Barfield\'s look something akin to admiration, and she\r\nfelt she had not been wholly wrong in her estimate of the girl\'s\r\ncharacter; she said, and in a different intonation--\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you were right, Esther. I couldn\'t have kept you on, on account\r\nof the bad example to the younger servants. I might have helped you with\r\nmoney. But six months alone in London and in your condition! ...I am glad\r\nyou did not tell me, Esther; and as you say there is another to think of\r\nnow, I hope you will never neglect your child, if God give it to you\r\nalive."\r\n\r\n"I hope not, ma\'am; I shall try and do my best."\r\n\r\n"My poor girl! my poor girl! you do not know what trial is in store for\r\nyou. A girl like you, and only twenty! ...Oh, it is a shame! May God give\r\nyou courage to bear up in your adversity!"\r\n\r\n"I know there is many a hard time before me, but I have prayed for\r\nstrength, and God will give me strength, and I must not complain. My case\r\nis not so bad as many another. I have nearly eight pounds. I shall get on,\r\nma\'am, that is to say if you will stand by me and not refuse me a\r\ncharacter."\r\n\r\n"Can I give you a character? You were tempted, you were led into\r\ntemptation. I ought to have watched over you better--mine is the\r\nresponsibility. Tell me, it was not your fault."\r\n\r\n"It is always a woman\'s fault, ma\'am. But he should not have deserted me\r\nas he did, that\'s the only thing I reproach him with, the rest was my\r\nfault--I shouldn\'t have touched the second glass of ale. Besides, I was in\r\nlove with him, and you know what that is. I thought no harm, and I let him\r\nkiss me. He used to take me out for walks on the hill and round the farm.\r\nHe told me he loved me, and would make me his wife--that\'s how it was.\r\nAfterwards he asked me to wait till after the Leger, and that riled me,\r\nand I knew then how wicked I had been. I would not go out with him or\r\nspeak to him any more; and while our quarrel was going on Miss Peggy went\r\nafter him, and that\'s how I got left."\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Peggy\'s name a cloud passed over Mrs. Barfield\'s face.\r\n"You have been shamefully treated, my poor child. I knew nothing of all\r\nthis. So he said he would marry you if he won his bet on the Leger? Oh,\r\nthat betting! I know that nothing else is thought of here; upstairs and\r\ndownstairs, the whole place is poisoned with it, and it is the fault of--"\r\nMrs. Barfield walked hurriedly across the room, but when she turned the\r\nsight of Esther provoked her into speech. "I have seen it all my life,\r\nnothing else, and I have seen nothing come of it but sin and sorrow; you\r\nare not the first victim. Ah, what ruin, what misery, what death!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield covered her face with her hands, as if to shut out the\r\nmemories that crowded upon her.\r\n\r\n"I think, ma\'am, if you will excuse my saying so, that a great deal of\r\nharm do come from this betting on race-horses. The day when you was all\r\naway at Goodwood when the horse won, I went down to see what the sea was\r\nlike here. I was brought up by the seaside at Barnstaple. On the beach I\r\nmet Mrs. Leopold, that is to say Mrs. Randal, John\'s wife; she seemed to\r\nbe in great trouble, she looked that melancholy, and for company\'s sake\r\nshe asked me to come home to tea with her. She was in that state of mind,\r\nma\'am, that she forgot the teaspoons were in pawn, and when she could not\r\ngive me one she broke down completely, and told me what her troubles had\r\nbeen."\r\n\r\n"What did she tell you, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly remember, ma\'am, but it was all the same thing--ruin if the\r\nhorse didn\'t win, and more betting if he did. But she said they never had\r\nbeen in such a fix as the day Silver Braid won. If he had been beaten they\r\nwould have been thrown out on the street, and from what I have heard the\r\nbest half of the town too."\r\n\r\n"So that little man has suffered. I thought he was wiser than the rest....\r\nThis house has been the ruin of the neighbourhood; we have dispensed vice\r\ninstead of righteousness." Walking towards the window, Mrs. Barfield\r\ncontinued to talk to herself. "I have struggled against the evil all my\r\nlife, and without result. How much more misery shall I see come of it?"\r\nTurning then to Esther she said, "Yes, the betting is an evil--one from\r\nwhich many have suffered--but the question is now about yourself, Esther.\r\nHow much money have you?"\r\n\r\n"I have about eight pounds, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"And how much do you reckon will see you through it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, ma\'am, I have no experience. I think father will let me\r\nstay at home if I can pay my way. I could manage easily on seven shillings\r\na week. When my time comes I shall go to the hospital."\r\n\r\nWhile Esther spoke Mrs. Barfield calculated roughly that about ten pounds\r\nwould meet most of her wants. Her train fare, two month\'s board at seven\r\nshillings a week, the room she would have to take near the hospital before\r\nher confinement, and to which she would return with her baby--all these\r\nwould run to about four or five pounds. There would be baby\'s clothes to\r\nbuy.... If she gave four pounds Esther would have then twelve pounds, and\r\nwith that she would be able to manage. Mrs. Barfield went over to an\r\nold-fashioned escritoire, and, pulling out some small drawers, took from\r\none some paper packages which she unfolded. "Now, my girl, look here. I\'m\r\ngoing to give you four pounds; then you will have twelve, and that ought\r\nto see you through your trouble. You have been a good servant, Esther; I\r\nlike you very much, and am truly sorry to part with you. You will write\r\nand tell me how you are getting on, and if one of these days you want a\r\nplace, and I have one to give you, I shall be glad to take you back."\r\n\r\nHarshness deadened and hardened her feelings, yet she was easily moved by\r\nkindness, and she longed to throw herself at her mistress\'s feet; but her\r\nnature did not admit of such effusion, and she said, in her blunt English\r\nway--\r\n\r\n"You are far too good, ma\'am; I do not deserve such treatment--I know I\r\ndon\'t."\r\n\r\n"Say no more, Esther. I hope that the Lord may give you strength to bear\r\nyour cross.... Now go and pack up your box. But, Esther, do you feel your\r\nsin, can you truly say honestly before God that you repent?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am, I think I can say all that."\r\n\r\n"Then, Esther, come and kneel down and pray to God to give you strength in\r\nthe future to stand against temptation."\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield took Esther\'s hand and they knelt down by the round table,\r\nleaning their hands on its edge. And, in a high, clear voice, Mrs.\r\nBarfield prayed aloud, Esther repeating the words after her--\r\n\r\n"Dear Lord, Thou knowest all things, knowest how Thy servant has strayed\r\nand has fallen into sin. But Thou hast said there is more joy in heaven\r\nover one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just men.\r\nTherefore, Lord, kneeling here before Thee, we pray that this poor girl,\r\nwho repents of the evil she has done, may be strengthened in Thy mercy to\r\nstand firm against temptation. Forgive her sin, even as Thou forgavest the\r\nwoman of Samaria. Give her strength to walk uprightly before Thee, and\r\ngive her strength to bear the pain and the suffering that lie before her."\r\n\r\nThe women rose from their knees and stood looking at each other. Esther\'s\r\neyes were full of tears. Without speaking she turned to go.\r\n\r\n"One word more, Esther. You asked me just now for a character; I\r\nhesitated, but it seems to me now that it would be wrong to refuse. If I\r\ndid you might never get a place, and then it would be impossible to say\r\nwhat might happen. I am not certain that I am doing right, but I know what\r\nit means to refuse to give a servant a character, and I cannot take upon\r\nmyself the responsibility."\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield wrote out a character for Esther, in which she described her\r\nas an honest, hard-working girl. She paused at the word "reliable," and\r\nwrote instead, "I believe her to be at heart a thoroughly religious girl."\r\n\r\nShe went upstairs to pack her box, and when she came down she found all\r\nthe women in the kitchen; evidently they were waiting for her. Coming\r\nforward, Sarah said--\r\n\r\n"I hope we shall part friends, Esther; any quarrels we may have\r\nhad--There\'s no ill-feeling now, is there?"\r\n\r\n"I bear no one any ill-feeling. We have been friends these last months;\r\nindeed, everyone has been very kind to me." And Esther kissed Sarah on\r\nboth cheeks.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we\'re all sorry to lose you," said Margaret, pressing forward,\r\n"and we hope you\'ll write and let us know how you are getting on."\r\n\r\nMargaret, who was a tender-hearted girl, began to cry, and, kissing\r\nEsther, she declared that she had never got on with a girl who slept in\r\nher room so well before. Esther shook hands with Grover, and then her eyes\r\nmet Mrs. Latch\'s. The old woman took her in her arms.\r\n\r\n"It breaks my heart to think that one belonging to me should have done you\r\nsuch a wrong--But if you want for anything let me know, and you shall have\r\nit. You will want money; I have some here for you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you, but I have all I want. Mrs. Barfield has been very\r\ngood to me."\r\n\r\nThe babbling of so many voices drew Mr. Leopold from the pantry; he came\r\nwith a glass of beer in his hand, and this suggested a toast to Sarah.\r\n"Let\'s drink baby\'s health," she said. "Mr. Leopold won\'t refuse us the\r\nbeer."\r\n\r\nThe idea provoked some good-natured laughter, and Esther hid her face in\r\nher hands and tried to get away. But Margaret would not allow her. "What\r\nnonsense!" she said. "We don\'t think any the worse of you; why that\'s an\r\naccident that might happen to any of us."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Esther.\r\n\r\nThe jug of beer was finished; she was kissed and hugged again, some tears\r\nwere shed, and Esther walked down the yard through the stables.\r\n\r\nThe avenue was full of wind and rain; the branches creaked dolefully\r\noverhead; the lane was drenched, and the bare fields were fringed with\r\nwhite mist, and the houses seemed very desolate by the bleak sea; and the\r\ngirl\'s soul was desolate as the landscape. She had come to Woodview to\r\nescape the suffering of a home which had become unendurable, and she was\r\ngoing back in circumstances a hundred times worse than those in which she\r\nhad left it, and she was going back with the memory of the happiness she\r\nhad lost. All the grief and trouble that girls of her class have so\r\nfrequently to bear gathered in Esther\'s heart when she looked out of the\r\nrailway carriage window and saw for the last time the stiff plantations on\r\nthe downs and the angles of the Italian house between the trees. She drew\r\nher handkerchief from her jacket, and hid her distress as well as she\r\ncould from the other occupants of the carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived at Victoria it was raining. She picked up her skirt, and\r\nas she stepped across a puddle a wild and watery wind swept up the wet\r\nstreets, catching her full in the face.\r\n\r\nShe had left her box in the cloak-room, for she did not know if her father\r\nwould have her at home. Her mother would tell her what she thought, but no\r\none could say for certain what he would do. If she brought the box he\r\nmight fling it after her into the street; better come without it, even if\r\nshe had to go back through the wet to fetch it. At that moment another\r\ngust drove the rain violently over her, forcing it through her boots. The\r\nsky was a tint of ashen grey, and all the low brick buildings were veiled\r\nin vapour; the rough roadway was full of pools, and nothing was heard but\r\nthe melancholy bell of the tram-car. She hesitated, not wishing to spend a\r\npenny unnecessarily, but remembering that a penny wise is often a pound\r\nfoolish she called to the driver and got in. The car passed by the little\r\nbrick street where the Saunders lived, and when Esther pushed the door\r\nopen she could see into the kitchen and overhear the voices of the\r\nchildren. Mrs. Saunders was sweeping down the stairs, but at the sound of\r\nfootsteps she ceased to bang the broom, and, stooping till her head looked\r\nover the banisters, she cried--\r\n\r\n"Who is it?"\r\n\r\n"Me, mother."\r\n\r\n"What! You, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother."\r\n\r\nMrs. Saunders hastened down, and, leaning the broom against the wall, she\r\ntook her daughter in her arms and kissed her. "Well, this is nice to see\r\nyou again, after this long while. But you are looking a bit poorly,\r\nEsther." Then her face changed expression. "What has happened? Have you\r\nlost your situation?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am that sorry, for we thought you was so \'appy there and liked your\r\nmistress above all those you \'ad ever met with. Did you lose your temper\r\nand answer her back? They is often trying, I know that, and your own\r\ntemper--you was never very sure of it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no fault to find with my mistress; she is the kindest in the\r\nworld--none better,--and my temper--it wasn\'t that, mother--"\r\n\r\n"My own darling, tell me--"\r\n\r\nEsther paused. The children had ceased talking in the kitchen, and the\r\nfront door was open. "Come into the parlour. We can talk quietly there....\r\nWhen do you expect father home?"\r\n\r\n"Not for the best part of a couple of hours yet."\r\n\r\nMrs. Saunders waited until Esther had closed the front door. Then they\r\nwent into the parlour and sat down side by side on the little horsehair\r\nsofa placed against the wall facing the window. The anxiety in their\r\nhearts betrayed itself on their faces.\r\n\r\n"I had to leave, mother. I\'m seven months gone."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Esther, Esther, I cannot believe it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother, it is quite true."\r\n\r\nEsther hurried through her story, and when her mother questioned her\r\nregarding details she said--\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother, what does it matter? I don\'t care to talk about it more than\r\nI can help."\r\n\r\nTears had begun to roll down Mrs. Saunders\' cheeks, and when she wiped\r\nthem away with the corner of her apron, Esther heard a sob.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cry, mother," said Esther. "I have been very wicked, I know, but\r\nGod will be good to me. I always pray to him, just as you taught me to do,\r\nand I daresay I shall get through my trouble somehow."\r\n\r\n"Your father will never let you stop \'ere; \'e\'ll say, just as afore, that\r\nthere be too many mouths to feed as it is."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want him to keep me for nothing--I know well enough if I did that\r\n\'e\'d put me outside quick enough. But I can pay my way. I earned good\r\nmoney while I was with the Barfields, and though she did tell me I must\r\ngo, Mrs. Barfield--the Saint they call her, and she is a saint if ever\r\nthere was one--gave me four pounds to see me, as she said, through my\r\ntrouble. I\'ve better than eleven pound. Don\'t cry, mother dear; crying\r\nwon\'t do no good, and I want you to help me. So long as the money holds\r\nout I can get a lodging anywhere, but I\'d like to be near you; and father\r\nmight be glad to let me have the parlour and my food for ten or eleven\r\nshillings a week--I could afford as much as that, and he never was the man\r\nto turn good money from his door. Do yer think he will?"\r\n\r\n"I dunno, dearie; \'tis hard to say what \'e\'ll do; he\'s a \'ard man to live\r\nwith. I\'ve \'ad a terrible time of it lately, and them babies allus coming.\r\nAh, we poor women have more than our right to bear with!"\r\n\r\n"Poor mother!" said Esther, and, taking her mother\'s hand in hers, she\r\npassed her arm round her, drew her closer, and kissed her. "I know what he\r\nwas; is he any worse now?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I think he drinks more, and is even rougher. It was only the other\r\nday, just as I was attending to his dinner--it was a nice piece of steak,\r\nand it looked so nice that I cut off a weany piece to taste. He sees me do\r\nit, and he cries out, \'Now then, guts, what are you interfering with my\r\ndinner for?\' I says, \'I only cut off a tiny piece to taste.\' \'Well, then,\r\ntaste that,\' he says, and strikes me clean between the eyes. Ah, yes,\r\nlucky for you to be in service; you\'ve half forgot by now what we\'ve to\r\nput up with \'ere."\r\n\r\n"You was always that soft with him, mother; he never touched me since I\r\ndashed the hot water in his face."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes I thinks I can bear it no longer, Esther, and long to go and\r\ndrown meself. Jenny and Julia--you remember little Julia; she \'as grown up\r\nsuch a big girl, and is getting on so well--they are both at work now in\r\nthe kitchen. Johnnie gives us a deal of trouble; he cannot tell a word of\r\ntruth; father took off his strap the other day and beat him dreadful, but\r\nit ain\'t no use. If it wasn\'t for Jenny and Julia I don\'t think we should\r\never make both ends meet; but they works all day at the dogs, and at the\r\nwarehouse their dogs is said to be neater and more lifelike than any\r\nother. Their poor fingers is worn away cramming the paper into the moulds;\r\nbut they never complains, no more shouldn\'t I if he was a bit gentler and\r\ndidn\'t take more than half of what he earns to the public-\'ouse. I was\r\nglad you was away, Esther, for you allus was of an \'asty temper and\r\ncouldn\'t \'ave borne it. I don\'t want to make my troubles seem worse than\r\nthey be, but sometimes I think I will break up, \'special when I get to\r\nthinking what will become of us and all them children, money growing less\r\nand expenses increasing. I haven\'t told yer, but I daresay you have\r\nnoticed that another one is coming. It is the children that breaks us poor\r\nwomen down altogether. Ah, well, yours be the hardest trouble, but you\r\nmust put a brave face on it; we\'ll do the best we can; none of us can say\r\nno more."\r\n\r\nMrs. Saunders wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron; Esther looked\r\nat her with her usual quiet, stubborn stare, and without further words\r\nmother and daughter went into the kitchen where the girls were at work. It\r\nwas a long, low room, with one window looking on a small back-yard, at the\r\nback of which was the coal-hole, the dust-bin, and a small outhouse. There\r\nwas a long table and a bench ran along the wall. The fireplace was on the\r\nleft-hand side; the dresser stood against the opposite wall; and amid the\r\npoor crockery, piled about in every available space, were the toy dogs,\r\nsome no larger than your hand, others almost as large as a small poodle.\r\nJenny and Julia had been working busily for some days, and were now\r\nfinishing the last few that remained of the order they had received from\r\nthe shop they worked for. Three small children sat on the floor tearing\r\nthe brown paper, which they handed as it was wanted to Jenny and Julia.\r\nThe big girls leaned over the table in front of iron moulds, filling them\r\nwith brown paper, pasting it down, tucking it in with strong and dexterous\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n"Why, it is Esther!" said Jenny, the elder girl. "And, lorks, ain\'t she\r\ngrand!--quite the lady. Why, we hardly knowed ye." And having kissed their\r\nsister circumspectly, careful not to touch the clothes they admired with\r\ntheir pasty fingers, they stood lost in contemplation, thrilled with\r\nconsciousness of the advantage of service.\r\n\r\nEsther took Harry, a fine little boy of four, up in her arms, and asked\r\nhim if he remembered her.\r\n\r\n"Naw, I don\'t think I do. Will oo put me down?"\r\n\r\n"But you do, Lizzie?" she said, addressing a girl of seven, whose bright\r\nred hair shone like a lamp in the gathering twilight.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'re my big sister; you\'ve been away this year or more in\r\nservice."\r\n\r\n"And you, Maggie, do you remember me too?"\r\n\r\nMaggie at first seemed doubtful, but after a moment\'s reflection she\r\nnodded her head vigorously.\r\n\r\n"Come, Esther, see how Julia is getting on," said Mrs. Saunders; "she\r\nmakes her dogs nearly as fast as Jenny. She is still a bit careless in\r\ndrawing the paper into the moulds. Well, just as I was speaking of it:\r\n\'ere\'s a dog with one shoulder just \'arf the size of the other."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother, I\'m sure nobody\'d never know the difference."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t know the difference! Just look at the hanimal! Is it natural?\r\nSich carelessness I never seed."\r\n\r\n"Esther, just look at Julia\'s dog," cried Jenny, "\'e \'asn\'t got no more\r\nthan \'arf a shoulder. It\'s lucky mother saw it, for if the manager\'d seen\r\nit he\'d have found something wrong with I don\'t know \'ow many more, and\r\ndocked us maybe a shilling or more on the week\'s work."\r\n\r\nJulia began to cry.\r\n\r\n"Jenny is always down on me. She is jealous just because mother said I\r\nworked as fast as she did. If her work was overhauled--"\r\n\r\n"There are all my dogs there on the right-hand side of the dresser--I\r\nalways \'as the right for my dogs--and if you find one there with an uneven\r\nshoulder I\'ll--"\r\n\r\n"Jennie is so fat that she likes everything like \'erself; that\'s why she\r\nstuffs so much paper into her dogs."\r\n\r\nIt was little Ethel speaking from her corner, and her explanation of the\r\nexcellence of Jenny\'s dogs, given with stolid childish gravity in the\r\ninterval of tearing a large sheet of brown paper, made them laugh. But in\r\nthe midst of the laughter thought of her great trouble came upon Esther.\r\nMrs. Saunders noticed this, and a look of pity came into her eyes, and to\r\nmake an end of the unseemly gaiety she took Julia\'s dog and told her that\r\nit must be put into the mould again. She cut the skin away, and helped to\r\nforce the stiff paper over the edge of the mould.\r\n\r\n"Now," she said, "it is a dog; both shoulders is equal, and if it was a\r\nreal dog he could walk."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother!" cried Jenny, "I shan\'t be able to finish my last dozen this\r\nevening. I \'ave no more buttons for the eyes, and the black pins that\r\nJulia is a-using of for her little one won\'t do for this size."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t they give yer any at the shop? I was counting on the money they\r\nwould bring to finish the week with."\r\n\r\n"No, we can\'t get no buttons in the shop: that\'s \'ome work, they says; and\r\neven if they \'ad them they wouldn\'t let us put them in there. That\'s \'ome\r\nwork they says to everything; they is a that disagreeable lot."\r\n\r\n"But \'aven\'t you got sixpence, mother? and I\'ll run and get them."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve run short."\r\n\r\n"But," said Esther, "I\'ll give you sixpence to get your buttons with."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it; give us sixpence, and yer shall have it back to-morrow if\r\nyou are \'ere. How long are yer up for? If not, we\'ll send it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going back just yet."\r\n\r\n"What, \'ave yer lost yer situation?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Mrs. Saunders, "Esther ain\'t well--she \'as come up for \'er\r\n\'ealth; take the sixpence and run along."\r\n\r\n"May I go too?" said Julia. "I\'ve been at work since eight, and I\'ve only\r\na few more dogs to do."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you may go with your sister. Run along; don\'t bother me any more,\r\nI\'ve got to get your father\'s supper."\r\n\r\nWhen Jenny and Julia had left, Esther and Mrs. Saunders could talk freely;\r\nthe other children were too young to understand.\r\n\r\n"There is times when \'e is well enough," said Mrs. Saunders, "and others\r\nwhen \'e is that awful. It is \'ard to know \'ow to get him, but \'e is to be\r\ngot if we only knew \'ow. Sometimes \'tis most surprising how easy \'e do\r\ntake things, and at others--well, as about that piece of steak that I was\r\na-telling you of. Should you catch him in that humour \'e\'s as like as not\r\nto take ye by the shoulder and put you out; but if he be in a good humour\r\n\'e\'s as like as not to say, \'Well, my gal, make yerself at \'ome.\'"\r\n\r\n"He can but turn me out, I\'ll leave yer to speak to \'im, mother."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do my best, but I don\'t answer for nothing. A nice bit of supper do\r\nmake a difference in \'im, and as ill luck will \'ave it, I\'ve nothing but a\r\nrasher, whereas if I only \'ad a bit of steak \'e\'d brighten up the moment\r\nhe clapt eyes on it and become that cheerful."\r\n\r\n"But, mother, if you think it will make a difference I can easily slip\r\nround to the butcher\'s and----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, get half a pound, and when it\'s nicely cooked and inside him it\'ll\r\nmake all the difference. That will please him. But I don\'t like to see you\r\nspending your money--money that you\'ll want badly."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be helped, mother. I shan\'t be above a minute or two away, and\r\nI\'ll bring back a pint of porter with the steak."\r\n\r\nComing back she met Jenny and Julia, and when she told them her purchases\r\nthey remarked significantly that they were now quite sure of a pleasant\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n"When he\'s done eating \'e\'ll go out to smoke his pipe with some of his\r\nchaps," said Jenny, "and we shall have the \'ouse to ourselves, and yer can\r\ntell us all about your situation. They keeps a butler and a footman, don\'t\r\nthey? They must be grand folk. And what was the footman like? Was he very\r\nhandsome? I\'ve \'eard that they all is."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll show us yer dresses, won\'t you?" said Julia. "How many \'ave\r\nyou got, and \'ow did yer manage to save up enough money to buy such\r\nbeauties, if they\'re all like that?"\r\n\r\n"This dress was given to me by Miss Mary."\r\n\r\n"Was it? She must be a real good \'un. I should like to go to service; I\'m\r\ntired of making dogs; we have to work that \'ard, and it nearly all goes to\r\nthe public; father drinks worse than ever."\r\n\r\nMrs. Saunders approved of Esther\'s purchase; it was a beautiful bit of\r\nsteak. The fire was raked up, and a few minutes after the meat was\r\nroasting on the gridiron. The clock continued its coarse ticking amid the\r\nrough plates on the dresser. Jenny and Julia hastened with their work,\r\npressing the paper with nervous fingers into the moulds, calling sharply\r\nto the little group for what sized paper they required. Esther and Mrs.\r\nSaunders waited, full of apprehension, for the sound of a heavy tread in\r\nthe passage. At last it came. Mrs. Saunders turned the meat, hoping that\r\nits savoury odour would greet his nostrils from afar, and that he would\r\ncome to them mollified and amiable.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Jim; yer are \'ome a bit earlier to-day. I\'m not quite ready with\r\nyer supper."\r\n\r\n"I dunno that I am. Hullo, Esther! Up for the day? Smells damned nice,\r\nwhat you\'re cooking for me, missus. What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Bit of steak, Jim. It seems a beautiful piece. Hope it will eat tender."\r\n\r\n"That it will. I was afeard you would have nothing more than a rasher, and\r\nI\'m that \'ungry."\r\n\r\nJim Saunders was a stout, dark man about forty. He had not shaved for some\r\ndays, his face was black with beard; his moustache was cut into bristle;\r\naround his short, bull neck he wore a ragged comforter, and his blue\r\njacket was shabby and dusty, and the trousers were worn at the heels. He\r\nthrew his basket into a corner, and then himself on the rough bench nailed\r\nagainst the wall, and there, without speaking another word, he lay\r\nsniffing the odour of the meat like an animal going to be fed. Suddenly a\r\nwhiff from the beer jug came into his nostrils, and reaching out his rough\r\nhand he looked into the jug to assure himself he was not mistaken.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?" he exclaimed; "a pint of porter! Yer are doing me pretty\r\nwell this evening, I reckon. What\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, Jim; nothing, dear, but just as Esther has come up we thought\r\nwe\'d try to make yer comfortable. It was Esther who fetched it; she \'as\r\nbeen doing pretty well, and can afford it."\r\n\r\nJim looked at Esther in a sort of vague and brutal astonishment, and\r\nfeeling he must say something, and not knowing well what, he said----\r\n\r\n"Well, \'ere\'s to your good health!" and he took a long pull at the jug.\r\n"Where did you get this?"\r\n\r\n"In Durham street, at the \'Angel.\'"\r\n\r\n"I thought as much; they don\'t sell stuff like this at the \'Rose and\r\nCrown.\' Well, much obliged to yer. I shall enjoy my bit of steak now; and\r\nI see a tater in the cinders. How are you getting on, old woman--is it\r\nnearly done? Yer know I don\'t like all the goodness burnt out of it."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t quite done yet, Jim; a few minutes more----"\r\n\r\nJim sniffed in eager anticipation, and then addressed himself to Esther.\r\n\r\n"Well, they seem to do yer pretty well down there. My word, what a toff\r\nyer are! Quite a lady.... There\'s nothing like service for a girl; I\'ve\r\nalways said so. Eh, Jenny, wouldn\'t yer like to go into service, like yer\r\nsister? Looks better, don\'t it, than making toy dogs at three-and-sixpence\r\nthe gross?"\r\n\r\n"I should just think it was. I wish I could. As soon as Maggie can take my\r\nplace, I mean to try."\r\n\r\n"It was the young lady of the \'ouse that gave \'er that nice dress," said\r\nJulia. "My eye! she must have been a favourite."\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mrs. Saunders picked the steak from the gridiron, and\r\nputting it on a nice hot plate she carried it in her apron to Jim, saying,\r\n"Mind yer \'ands, it is burning \'ot."\r\n\r\nJim fed in hungry silence, the children watching, regretting that none of\r\nthem ever had suppers like that. He didn\'t speak until he had put away the\r\nbetter part of the steak; then, after taking a long pull at the jug of\r\nbeer, he said--\r\n\r\n"I \'aven\'t enjoyed a bit of food like that this many a day; I was that\r\nbeat when I came in, and it does do one good to put a piece of honest meat\r\ninto one\'s stomach after a \'ard day\'s work!"\r\n\r\nThen, prompted by a sudden thought, he complimented Esther on her looks,\r\nand then, with increasing interest, inquired what kind of people she was\r\nstaying with. But Esther was in no humour for conversation, and answered\r\nhis questions briefly without entering into details. Her reserve only\r\nincreased his curiosity, which fired up at the first mention of the\r\nrace-horses.\r\n\r\n"I scarcely know much about them. I only used to see them passing through\r\nthe yard as they went to exercise on the downs. There was always a lot of\r\ntalk about them in the servants\' hall, but I didn\'t notice it. They were a\r\ngreat trouble to Mrs. Barfield--I told you, mother, that she was one of\r\nourselves, didn\'t I?"\r\n\r\nA look of contempt passed over Jim\'s face, and he said--\r\n\r\n"We\'ve quite enough talk \'ere about the Brethren; give them a rest. What\r\nabout the \'orses? Did they win any races? Yer can\'t \'ave missed \'earing\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Silver Braid won the Stewards\' Cup."\r\n\r\n"Silver Braid was one of your horses?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Barfield won thousands and thousands, everyone in Shoreham won\r\nsomething, and a ball for the servants was given in the Gardens."\r\n\r\n"And you never thought of writing to me about it! I could have \'ad thirty\r\nto one off Bill Short. One pound ten to a bob! And yer never thought it\r\nworth while to send me the tip. I\'m blowed! Girls aren\'t worth a damn....\r\nThirty to one off Bill Short--he\'d have laid it. I remember seeing the\r\nprice quoted in all the papers. Thirty to one taken and hoffered. If you\r\nhad told me all yer knowed I might \'ave gone \'alf a quid--fifteen pun to\r\n\'alf a quid! as much as I\'d earn in three months slaving eight and ten\r\nhours a day, paint-pot on \'and about them blooming engines. Well, there\'s\r\nno use crying over what\'s done--sich a chance won\'t come again, but\r\nsomething else may. What are they going to do with the \'orse this\r\nautumn--did yer \'ear that?"\r\n\r\n"I think I \'eard that he was entered for the Cambridgeshire, but if I\r\nremember rightly, Mr. Leopold--that\'s the butler, not his real name, but\r\nwhat we call him--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; I know; after the Baron. Now what do \'e say? I reckon \'e knows.\r\nI should like to \'ave \'alf-an-hour\'s talk with your Mr. Leopold. What do\r\n\'e say? For what \'e says, unless I\'m pretty well mistaken, is worth\r\nlistening to. A man wouldn\'t be a-wasting \'is time in listening to \'im.\r\nWhat do \'e say?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Leopold never says much. He\'s the only one the Gaffer ever confides\r\nin. \'Tis said they are as thick as thieves, so they say. Mr. Leopold was\r\nhis confidential servant when the Gaffer--that\'s the squire--was a\r\nbachelor."\r\n\r\nJim chuckled. "Yes, I think I know what kind of man your Mr. Leopold is\r\nlike. But what did \'e say about the Cambridgeshire?"\r\n\r\n"He only laughed a little once, and said he didn\'t think the \'orse would\r\ndo much good in the autumn races--no, not races, that isn\'t the word."\r\n\r\n"Handicaps?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it. But there\'s no relying on what Mr. Leopold says--he never\r\nsays what he really means. But I \'eard William, that\'s the footman--"\r\n\r\n"What are you stopping for? What did yer \'ear \'im say?"\r\n\r\n"That he intends to have something on next spring."\r\n\r\n"Did he say any race? Did he say the City and Sub.?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that was the race he mentioned."\r\n\r\n"I thought that would be about the length and the breadth of it," Jim\r\nsaid, as he took up his knife and fork. There was only a small portion of\r\nthe beef-steak left, and this he ate gluttonously, and, finishing the last\r\nremaining beer, he leaned back in the happiness of repletion. He crammed\r\ntobacco into a dirty clay, with a dirtier finger-nail, and said--\r\n\r\n"I\'d be uncommon glad to \'ear how he is getting on. When are you going\r\nback? Up for the day only?"\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer, and Jim looked inquiringly as he reached across the\r\ntable for the matches. The decisive moment had arrived, and Mrs. Saunders\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Esther ain\'t a-going back; leastways--"\r\n\r\n"Not going back! You don\'t mean that she ain\'t contented in her\r\nsituation--that she \'as--"\r\n\r\n"Esther ain\'t going back no more," Mrs. Saunders answered, incautiously.\r\n"Look ee \'ere, Jim--"\r\n\r\n"Out with it, old woman--no \'umbug! What is it all about? Ain\'t going back\r\nto \'er sitooation, and where she \'as been treated like that--just look at\r\nthe duds she \'as got on."\r\n\r\nThe evening was darkening rapidly, and the firelight flickered over the\r\nback of the toy dogs piled up on the dresser. Jim had lit his pipe, and\r\nthe acrid and warm odour of quickly-burning tobacco overpowered the smell\r\nof grease and the burnt skin of the baked potato, a fragment of which\r\nremained on the plate; only the sickly flavour of drying paste was\r\ndistinguishable in the reek of the short black clay which the man held\r\nfirmly between his teeth. Esther sat by the fire, her hands crossed over\r\nher knees, no signs of emotion on her sullen, plump face. Mrs. Saunders\r\nstood on the other side of Esther, between her and the younger children,\r\nnow quarrelling among themselves, and her face was full of fear as she\r\nwatched her husband anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, old woman, blurt it out!" he said. "What is it? Can it be the\r\ngirl \'as lost her sitooation--got the sack? Yes, I see that\'s about the\r\ncut of it. Her beastly temper! So they couldn\'t put up with it in the\r\ncountry any more than I could mesel\'. Well, it\'s \'er own look-out! If she\r\ncan afford to chuck up a place like that, so much the better for \'er.\r\nPity, though; she might \'ave put me up to many a good thing."\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t that, Jim. The girl is in trouble."\r\n\r\n"Wot do yer say? Esther in trouble? Well, that\'s the best bit I\'ve heard\r\nthis long while. I always told ye that the religious ones were just the\r\nsame as the others--a bit more hypocritical, that\'s all. So she that\r\nwouldn\'t \'ave nothing to do with such as was Mrs. Dunbar \'as got \'erself\r\ninto trouble! Well I never! But \'tis just what I always suspected. The\r\ngoody-goody sort are the worst. So she \'as got \'erself into trouble! Well,\r\nshe\'ll \'ave to get \'erself out of it."\r\n\r\n"Now, Jim, dear, yer mustn\'t be \'ard on \'er; she could tell a very\r\ndifferent story if she wished it, but yer know what she is. There she sits\r\nlike a block of marble, and won\'t as much as say a word in \'er own\r\ndefence."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want \'er to speak. I don\'t care, it\'s nothing to me; I only\r\nlaughed because--"\r\n\r\n"Jim, dear, it is something to all of us. What we thought was that you\r\nmight let her stop \'ere till her time was come to go to the \'orspital."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s it, is it? That was the meaning of the \'alf-pound of steak and\r\nthe pint of porter, was it. I thought there was something hup. So she\r\nwants to stop \'ere, do she? As if there wasn\'t enough already! Well, I be\r\nblowed if she do! A nice thing, too; a girl can\'t go away to service\r\nwithout coming back to her respectable \'ome in trouble--in trouble, she\r\ncalls it. Now, I won\'t \'ave it; there\'s enough \'ere as it is, and another\r\ncoming, worse luck. We wants no bastards \'ere.... And a nice example, too,\r\nfor the other children! No, I won\'t \'ave it!"\r\n\r\nJenny and Julia looked curiously at Esther, who sat quite still, her face\r\nshowing no sign of emotion. Mrs. Saunders turned towards her, a pitying\r\nlook on her face, saying clearly, "You see, my poor girl, how matters\r\nstand; I can do nothing."\r\n\r\nThe girl, although she did not raise her eyes, understood what was passing\r\nin her mother\'s mind, for there was a grave deliberativeness in the manner\r\nin which she rose from the chair.\r\n\r\nBut just as the daughter had guessed what was passing in the mother\'s\r\nmind, so did the mother guess what was passing in the daughter\'s. Mrs.\r\nSaunders threw herself before Esther, saying, "Oh, no, Esther, wait a\r\nmoment; \'e won\'t be \'ard on \'ee." Then turning to her husband, "Yer don\'t\r\nunderstand, Jim. It is only for a little time."\r\n\r\n"No, I tell yer. No, I won\'t \'ave it! There be too many \'ere as it is."\r\n\r\n"Only a little while, Jim."\r\n\r\n"No. And those who ain\'t wanted \'ad better go at once--that\'s my advice to\r\nthem. The place is as full of us that we can \'ardly turn round as it is.\r\nNo, I won\'t \'ear of it!"\r\n\r\n"But, Jim, Esther is quite willing to pay her way; she\'s saved a good\r\nlittle sum of money, and could afford to pay us ten shillings a week for\r\nboard and the parlour."\r\n\r\nA perplexed look came on Jim\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t yer tell me that afore? Of course I don\'t wish to be \'ard on\r\nthe girl, as yer \'ave just heard me say. Ten shillings a week for her\r\nboard and the parlour--that seems fair enough; and if it\'s any convenience\r\nto \'er to remain, I\'m sure we\'ll be glad to \'ave \'er. I\'ll say right glad,\r\ntoo. We was always good friends, Esther, wasn\'t we, though ye wasn\'t one\r\nof my own?" So saying, Jim held out his hand.\r\n\r\nEsther tried to pass by her mother. "I don\'t want to stop where I\'m not\r\nwanted; I wants no one\'s charity. Let me go, mother."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Esther. \'Aven\'t yer \'eard what \'e says? Ye are my child if you\r\nain\'t \'is, and it would break my \'eart, that it would, to see you go away\r\namong strangers. Yer place is among yer own people, who\'ll look after\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Now, then, Esther, why should there be ill feeling. I didn\'t mean any\r\n\'arm. There\'s a lot of us \'ere, and I\'ve to think of the interests of my\r\nown. But for all that I should be main sorry to see yer take yer money\r\namong strangers, where you wouldn\'t get no value for it. You\'d better\r\nstop. I\'m sorry for what I said. Ain\'t that enough for yer?"\r\n\r\n"Jim, Jim, dear, don\'t say no more; leave \'er to me. Esther, for my sake\r\nstop with us. You are in trouble, and it is right for you to stop with me.\r\nJim \'as said no more than the truth. With all the best will in the world\r\nwe couldn\'t afford to keep yer for nothing, but since yer can pay yer way,\r\nit is yer duty to stop. Think, Esther, dear, think. Go and shake \'ands\r\nwith \'im, and I\'ll go and make yer up a bed on the sofa."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no bloody need for \'er to shake my \'and if she don\'t like," Jim\r\nreplied, and he pulled doggedly at his pipe.\r\n\r\nEsther tried, but her fierce and heavy temper held her back. She couldn\'t\r\ngo to her father for reconciliation, and the matter might have ended quite\r\ndifferently, but suddenly, without another word, Jim put on his hat and\r\nwent out to join "his chaps" who were waiting for him about the\r\npublic-house, close to the cab-rank in the Vauxhall Bridge Road. The door\r\nwas hardly closed behind him when the young children laughed and ran about\r\njoyously, and Jenny and Julia went over to Esther and begged her to stop.\r\n\r\n"Of course she\'ll stop," said Mrs. Saunders. "And now, Esther, come along\r\nand help me to make you up a bed in the parlour."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEsther was fast asleep next morning when Mrs. Saunders came into the\r\nparlour. Mrs. Saunders stood looking at her, and Esther turned suddenly on\r\nthe sofa and said----\r\n\r\n"What time is it, mother?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s gone six; but don\'t you get up. You\'re your own mistress whilst\r\nyou\'re here; you pays for what you \'as."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t afford them lazy habits. There\'s plenty of work here, and I must\r\nhelp you with some of it."\r\n\r\n"Plenty of work here, that\'s right enough. But why should you bother, and\r\nyou nearly seven months gone? I daresay you feels that \'eavy that you\r\nnever care to get out of your chair. But they says that them who works up\r\nto the last \'as the easiest time in the end. Not that I\'ve found it so."\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused. Esther threw her legs over the side of the sofa,\r\nand still wrapped in the blanket, sat looking at her mother.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t be over-comfortable on that bit of sofa," said Mrs. Saunders.\r\n\r\n"Lor, I can manage right enough, if that was all."\r\n\r\n"You is that cast down, Esther; you mustn\'t give way. Things sometimes\r\nturns out better than one expects."\r\n\r\n"You never found they did, mother."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I didn\'t, but that says nothing for others. We must bear up as\r\nbest we can."\r\n\r\nOne word led to another, and very soon Esther was telling her mother the\r\nwhole tale of her misfortune--all about William, the sweepstakes, the ball\r\nat the Shoreham Gardens, the walks about the farm and hillside.\r\n\r\n"Service is no place for a girl who wants to live as we used to live when\r\nfather was alive--no service that I\'ve seen. I see that plain enough.\r\nMistress was one of the Brethren like ourselves, and she had to put up\r\nwith betting and drinking and dancing, and never a thought of the Lord.\r\nThere was no standing out against it. They call you Creeping Jesus if you\r\nsay your prayers, and you can\'t say them with a girl laughing or singing\r\nbehind your back, so you think you\'ll say them to yourself in bed, but\r\nsleep comes sooner than you expect, and so you slips out of the habit.\r\nThen the drinking. We was brought up teetotal, but they\'re always pressing\r\nit upon you, and to please him I said I would drink the \'orse\'s \'ealth.\r\nThat\'s how it began.... You don\'t know what it is, mother; you only knew\r\nGod-fearing men until you married him. We aren\'t all good like you,\r\nmother. But I thought no harm, indeed I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"A girl can\'t know what a man is thinking of, and we takes the worst for\r\nthe best."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that I was altogether blameless but--"\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t know he was that bad."\r\n\r\nEsther hesitated.\r\n\r\n"I knew he was like other men. But he told me--he promised me he\'d marry\r\nme."\r\n\r\nMrs. Saunders did not answer, and Esther said, "You don\'t believe I\'m\r\nspeaking the truth."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do, dearie. I was only thinking. You\'re my daughter; no mother had\r\na better daughter. There never was a better girl in this world."\r\n\r\n"I was telling you, mother--"\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want no telling that my Esther ain\'t a bad girl."\r\n\r\nMrs. Saunders sat nodding her head, a sweet, uncritical mother; and Esther\r\nunderstood how unselfishly her mother loved her, and how simply she\r\nthought of how she might help her in her trouble. Neither spoke, and\r\nEsther continued dressing.\r\n\r\n"You \'aven\'t told me what you think of your room. It looks pretty, don\'t\r\nyou think? I keeps it as nice as I can. Jenny hung up them pictures. They\r\nlivens it up a bit," she said, pointing to the coloured supplements, from\r\nthe illustrated papers, on the wall. "The china shepherd and shepherdess,\r\nyou know; they was at Barnstaple."\r\n\r\nWhen Esther was dressed, she and Mrs. Saunders knelt down and said a\r\nprayer together. Then Esther said she would make up her room, and when\r\nthat was done she insisted on helping her mother with the housework.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon she sat with her sisters, helping them with their dogs,\r\nfolding the paper into the moulds, pasting it down, or cutting the skins\r\ninto the requisite sizes. About five, when the children had had their tea,\r\nshe and her mother went for a short walk. Very often they strolled through\r\nVictoria Station, amused by the bustle of the traffic, or maybe they\r\nwandered down the Buckingham Palace Road, attracted by the shops. And\r\nthere was a sad pleasure in these walks. The elder woman had borne years\r\nof exceeding trouble, and felt her strength failing under her burdens,\r\nwhich instead of lightening were increasing; the younger woman was full of\r\nnervous apprehension for the future and grief for the past. But they loved\r\neach other deeply. Esther threw herself in the way to protect her mother,\r\nwhether at a dangerous crossing or from the heedlessness of the crowd at a\r\ncorner, and often a passer-by turned his head and looked after them,\r\nattracted by the solicitude which the younger woman showed for the elder.\r\nIn those walks very little was said. They walked in silence, slipping now\r\nand then into occasional speech, and here and there a casual allusion or a\r\nbroken sentence would indicate what was passing in their minds.\r\n\r\nOne day some flannel and shirts in a window caught Mrs. Saunder\'s eye, and\r\nshe said--\r\n\r\n"It is time, Esther, you thought about your baby clothes. One must be\r\nprepared; one never knows if one will go one\'s full time."\r\n\r\nThe words came upon Esther with something of a shock, helping her to\r\nrealise the imminence of her trouble.\r\n\r\n"You must have something by you, dear; one never knows how it is going to\r\nturn out; even I who have been through it do feel that nervous. I looks\r\nround the kitchen when I\'m taken with the pains, and I says, \'I may never\r\nsee this room again.\'"\r\n\r\nThe words were said in an undertone to Esther, and the shop-woman turned\r\nto get down the ready-made things which Mrs. Saunders had asked to see.\r\n\r\n"Here," said the shopwoman, "is the gown, longcloth, one-and-sixpence;\r\nhere is the flannel, one-and-sixpence; and here is the little shirt,\r\nsixpence."\r\n\r\n"You must have these to go on with, dear, and if the baby lives you\'ll\r\nwant another set."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother, of course he\'ll live; why shouldn\'t he?"\r\n\r\nEven the shopwoman smiled, and Mrs. Saunders, addressing the shopwoman,\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Them that knows nothing about it is allus full of \'ope."\r\n\r\nThe shopwoman raised her eyes, sighed, and inquired sympathetically if\r\nthis was the young lady\'s first confinement.\r\n\r\nMrs. Saunders nodded and sighed, and then the shopwoman asked Mrs.\r\nSaunders if she required any baby clothes. Mrs. Saunders said she had all\r\nshe required. The parcel was made up, and they were preparing to leave,\r\nwhen Esther said--\r\n\r\n"I may as well buy the material and make another set--it will give me\r\nsomething to do in the afternoons. I think I should like to make them."\r\n\r\n"We have some first-rate longcloth at sixpence-half-penny a yard."\r\n\r\n"You might take three yards, Esther; if anything should happen to yer\r\nbairn it will always come in useful. And you had better take three yards\r\nof flannel. How much is yer flannel?"\r\n\r\n"We have some excellent flannel," said the woman, lifting down a long,\r\nheavy package in dull yellow paper; "this is ten-pence a yard. You will\r\nwant a finer longcloth for the little shirts."\r\n\r\nAnd every afternoon Esther sat in the parlour by the window, seeing, when\r\nshe raised her eyes from the sewing, the low brick street full of\r\nchildren, and hearing the working women calling from the open doors or\r\nwindows; and as she worked at the baby clothes, never perhaps to be worn,\r\nher heart sank at the long prospect that awaited her, the end of which she\r\ncould not see, for it seemed to reach to the very end of her life. In\r\nthese hours she realised in some measure the duties that life held in\r\nstore, and it seemed to her that they exceeded her strength. Never would\r\nshe be able to bring him up--he would have no one to look to but her. She\r\nnever imagined other than that her child would be a boy. The task was\r\nclearly more than she could perform, and in despair she thought it would\r\nbe better for it to die. What would happen if she remained out of a\r\nsituation? Her father would not have her at home, that she knew well\r\nenough. What should she do, and the life of another depending on her? She\r\nwould never see William again--that was certain. He had married a lady,\r\nand, were they to meet, he would not look at her. Her temper grew hot, and\r\nthe memory of the injustice of which she had been a victim pressed upon\r\nher. But when vain anger passed away she thought of her baby, anticipating\r\nthe joy she would experience when he held out tiny hands to her, and that,\r\ntoo, which she would feel when he laid an innocent cheek to hers; and her\r\ndream persisting, she saw him learning a trade, going to work in the\r\nmorning and coming back to her in the evening, proud in the accomplishment\r\nof something done, of good money honestly earned.\r\n\r\nShe thought a great deal, too, of her poor mother, who was looking\r\nstrangely weak and poorly, and whose condition was rendered worse by her\r\nnervous fears that she would not get through this confinement. For the\r\ndoctor had told Mrs. Saunders that the next time it might go hard with\r\nher; and in this house, her husband growing more reckless and drunken, it\r\nwas altogether a bad look-out, and she might die for want of a little\r\nnourishment or a little care. Unfortunately they would both be down at the\r\nsame time, and it was almost impossible that Esther should be well in time\r\nto look after her mother. That brute! It was wrong to think of her father\r\nso, but he seemed to be without mercy for any of them. He had come in\r\nyesterday half-boozed, having kept back part of his money--he had come in\r\ntramping and hiccuping.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, old girl, out with it! I must have a few halfpence; my chaps\r\nis waiting for me, and I can\'t be looking down their mouths with nothing\r\nin my pockets."\r\n\r\n"I only have a few halfpence to get the children a bit of dinner; if I\r\ngive them to you they\'ll have nothing to eat."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the children can eat anything; I want beer. If yer \'aven\'t money,\r\nmake it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Saunders said that if he had any spare clothes she would take them\r\nround the corner. He only answered--\r\n\r\n"Well, if I \'aven\'t a spare waistcoat left just take some of yer own\r\nthings. I tell yer I want beer, and I mean to have some."\r\n\r\nThen, with his fist raised, he came at his poor wife, ordering her to take\r\none of the sheets from the bed and "make money," and would have struck her\r\nif Esther had not come between them and, with her hand in her pocket,\r\nsaid, "Be quiet, father; I\'ll give you the money you want."\r\n\r\nShe had done the same before, and, if needs be, she would do so again. She\r\ncould not see her mother struck, perhaps killed by that brute; her first\r\nduty was to save her mother, but these constant demands on her little\r\nsavings filled her with terror. She would want every penny; the ten\r\nshillings he had already had from her might be the very sum required to\r\nput her on her feet again, and send her in search of a situation where she\r\nwould be able to earn money for the boy. But if this extortion continued\r\nshe did not know what she would do, and that night she prayed that God\r\nmight not delay the birth of her child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\n"I wish, mother, you was going to the hospital with me; it would save a\r\nlot of expense and you\'d be better cared for."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to be with you, dearie, but I can\'t leave my \'ome, all these\r\nyoung children about and no one to give an order. I must stop where I am.\r\nBut I\'ve been intending to tell you--it is time that you was thinking\r\nabout yer letter."\r\n\r\n"What letter, mother?"\r\n\r\n"They don\'t take you without a letter from one of the subscribers. If I\r\nwas you, now that the weather is fine and you have strength for the walk,\r\nI\'d go up to Queen Charlotte\'s. It is up the Edgware Road way, I think.\r\nWhat do you think about to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow\'s Sunday."\r\n\r\n"That makes no matter, them horspitals is open."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go to-morrow when we have washed up."\r\n\r\nOn Friday Esther had had to give her father more money for drink. She gave\r\nhim two shillings, and that made a sovereign that he had had from her. On\r\nSaturday night he had been brought home helplessly drunk long after\r\nmidnight, and next morning one of the girls had to fetch him a drop of\r\nsomething to pull him together. He had lain in bed until dinner-time,\r\nswearing he would brain anyone who made the least noise. Even the Sunday\r\ndinner, a nice beef-steak pudding, hardly tempted him, and he left the\r\ntable saying that if he could find Tom Carter they would take a penny boat\r\nand go for a blow on the river. The whole family waited for his departure.\r\nBut he lingered, talked inconsequently, and several times Mrs. Saunders\r\nand the children gave up hope. Esther sat without a word. He called her a\r\nsulky brute, and, snatching up his hat, left the house. The moment he was\r\ngone the children began to chatter like birds. Esther put on her hat and\r\njacket.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going, mother."\r\n\r\n"Well, take care of yourself. Good luck to you."\r\n\r\nEsther smiled sadly. But the beautiful weather melted on her lips, her\r\nlungs swelled with the warm air, and she noticed the sparrow that flew\r\nacross the cab rank, and saw the black dot pass down a mews and disappear\r\nunder the eaves. It was a warm day in the middle of April, a mist of green\r\nhad begun in the branches of the elms of the Green Park; and in Park Lane,\r\nin all the balconies and gardens, wherever nature could find roothold, a\r\nspray of gentle green met the eye. There was music, too, in the air, the\r\nsound of fifes and drums, and all along the roadway as far as she could\r\nsee the rapid movement of assembling crowds. A procession with banners was\r\nturning the corner of the Edgware Road, and the policeman had stopped the\r\ntraffic to allow it to pass. The principal banner blew out blue and gold\r\nin the wind, and the men that bore the poles walked with strained backs\r\nunder the weight; the music changed, opinions about the objects of the\r\ndemonstration were exchanged, and it was some time before Esther could\r\ngain the policeman\'s attention. At last the conductor rang his bell, the\r\nomnibus started, and gathering courage she asked the way. It seemed to her\r\nthat every one was noticing her, and fearing to be overheard she spoke so\r\nlow that the policeman understood her to say Charlotte Street. At that\r\nmoment an omnibus drew up close beside them.\r\n\r\n"Charlotte Street, Charlotte Street," said the policeman, "there\'s\r\nCharlotte Street, Bloomsbury." Before Esther could answer he had turned to\r\nthe conductor. "You don\'t know any Charlotte Street about here, do you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. But can\'t yer see that it ain\'t no Charlotte Street she\r\nwants, but Queen Charlotte\'s Hospital? And ye\'d better lose no time in\r\ndirecting her."\r\n\r\nA roar of coarse laughter greeted this pleasantry, and burning with shame\r\nshe hurried down the Edgware Road. But she had not gone far before she had\r\nto ask again, and she scanned the passers-by seeking some respectable\r\nwoman, or in default an innocent child.\r\n\r\nShe came at last to an ugly desert place. There was the hospital, square,\r\nforbidding; and opposite a tall, lean building with long grey columns.\r\nEsther rang, and the great door, some fifteen feet high, was opened by a\r\nsmall boy.\r\n\r\n"I want to see the secretary."\r\n\r\n"Will you come this way?"\r\n\r\nShe was shown into a waiting-room, and while waiting she looked at the\r\nreligious prints on the walls. A lad of fifteen or sixteen came in. He\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"You want to see the secretary?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m afraid you can\'t see him; he\'s out."\r\n\r\n"I have come a long way; is there no one else I can see?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you can see me--I\'m his clerk. Have you come to be confined?"\r\n\r\nEsther answered that she had.\r\n\r\n"But," said the boy, "you are not in labour; we never take anyone in\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"I do not expect to be confined for another month. I came to make\r\narrangements."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got a letter?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then you must get a letter from one of the subscribers."\r\n\r\n"But I do not know any."\r\n\r\n"You can have a book of their names and addresses."\r\n\r\n"But I know no one."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t know them. You can go and call. Take those that live\r\nnearest--that\'s the way it is done."\r\n\r\n"Then will you give me the book?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and get one."\r\n\r\nThe boy returned a moment after with a small book, for which he demanded a\r\nshilling. Since she had come to London her hand had never been out of her\r\npocket. She had her money with her; she did not dare leave it at home on\r\naccount of her father. The clerk looked out the addresses for her and she\r\ntried to remember them--two were in Cumberland Place, another was in\r\nBryanstone Square. In Cumberland Place she was received by an elderly lady\r\nwho said she did not wish to judge anyone, but it was her invariable\r\npractice to give letters only to married women. There was a delicate smell\r\nof perfume in the room; the lady stirred the fire and lay back in her\r\narmchair. Once or twice Esther tried to withdraw, but the lady, although\r\nunswervingly faithful to her principles, seemed not indifferent to\r\nEsther\'s story, and asked her many questions.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what interest all that can be to you, as you ain\'t going to\r\ngive me a letter," Esther answered.\r\n\r\nThe next house she called at the lady was not at home, but she was\r\nexpected back presently, and the maid servant asked her to take a seat in\r\nthe hall. But when Esther refused information about her troubles she was\r\ncalled a stuck-up thing who deserved all she got, and was told there was\r\nno use her waiting. At the next place she was received by a footman who\r\ninsisted on her communicating her business to him. Then he said he would\r\nsee if his master was in. He wasn\'t in; he must have just gone out. The\r\nbest time to find him was before half-past ten in the morning.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be sure to do all he can for you--he always do for the good-looking\r\nones. How did it all happen?"\r\n\r\n"What business is that of yours? I don\'t ask your business."\r\n\r\n"Well, you needn\'t turn that rusty."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the master entered. He asked Esther to come into his study.\r\nHe was a tall, youngish-looking man of three or four-and-thirty, with\r\nbright eyes and hair, and there was in his voice and manner a kindness\r\nthat impressed Esther. She wished, however, that she had seen his mother\r\ninstead of him, for she was more than ever ashamed of her condition. He\r\nseemed genuinely sorry for her, and regretted that he had given all his\r\ntickets away. Then a thought struck him, and he wrote a letter to one of\r\nhis friends, a banker in Lincoln\'s Inn Fields. This gentleman, he said,\r\nwas a large subscriber to the hospital, and would certainly give her the\r\nletter she required. He hoped that Esther would get through her trouble\r\nall right.\r\n\r\nThe visit brought a little comfort into the girl\'s heart; and thinking of\r\nhis kind eyes she walked slowly, inquiring out her way until she got back\r\nto the Marble Arch, and stood looking down the long Bayswater Road. The\r\nlamps were beginning in the light, and the tall houses towered above the\r\nsunset. Esther watched the spectral city, and some sensation of the poetry\r\nof the hour must have stolen into her heart, for she turned into the Park,\r\nchoosing to walk there. Upon its dim green grey the scattered crowds were\r\nlike strips of black tape. Here and there by the railings the tape had\r\nbeen wound up in a black ball, and the peg was some democratic orator,\r\npromising poor human nature unconditional deliverance from evil. Further\r\non were heard sounds from a harmonium, and hymns were being sung, and in\r\neach doubting face there was something of the perplexing, haunting look\r\nwhich the city wore.\r\n\r\nA chill wind was blowing. Winter had returned with the night, but the\r\ninstinct of spring continued in the branches. The deep, sweet scent of the\r\nhyacinth floated along the railings, and the lovers that sat with their\r\narms about each other on every seat were of Esther\'s own class. She would\r\nhave liked to have called them round her and told them her miserable\r\nstory, so that they might profit by her experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more than three weeks now remained between her and the dreaded day. She\r\nhad hoped to spend them with her mother, who was timorous and desponding,\r\nand stood in need of consolation. But this was not to be; her father\'s\r\ndrunkenness continued, and daily he became more extortionate in his\r\ndemands for money. Esther had not six pounds left, and she felt that she\r\nmust leave. It had come to this, that she doubted if she were to stay on\r\nthat the clothes on her back might not be taken from her. Mrs. Saunders\r\nwas of the same opinion, and she urged Esther to go. But scruples\r\nrestrained her.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bring myself to leave you, mother; something tells me I should\r\nstay with you. It is dreadful to be parted from you. I wish you was coming\r\nto the hospital; you\'d be far safer there than at home."\r\n\r\n"I know that, dearie; but where\'s the good in talking about it? It only\r\nmakes it harder to bear. You know I can\'t leave. It is terrible hard, as\r\nyou says." Mrs. Saunders held her apron to her eyes and cried. "You have\r\nalways been a good girl, never a better--my one consolation since your\r\npoor father died."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t cry, mother," said Esther; "the Lord will watch over us, and we\r\nshall both pray for each other. In about a month, dear, we shall be both\r\nquite well, and you\'ll bless my baby, and I shall think of the time when I\r\nshall put him into your arms."\r\n\r\n"I hope so, Esther; I hope so, but I am full of fears. I\'m sore afraid\r\nthat we shall never see one another again--leastways on this earth."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother, dear, yer mustn\'t talk like that; you\'ll break my heart, that\r\nyou will."\r\n\r\nThe cab that took Esther to her lodging cost half-a-crown, and this waste\r\nof money frightened her thrifty nature, inherited through centuries of\r\nworking folk. The waste, however, had ceased at last, and it was none too\r\nsoon, she thought, as she sat in the room she had taken near the hospital,\r\nin a little eight-roomed house, kept by an old woman whose son was a\r\nbricklayer.\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of the week, one afternoon, as Esther was sitting alone\r\nin her room, that there came within her a great and sudden shock--life\r\nseemed to be slipping from her, and she sat for some minutes quite unable\r\nto move. She knew that her time had come, and when the pain ceased she\r\nwent downstairs to consult Mrs. Jones.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t I better go to the hospital now, Mrs. Jones?"\r\n\r\n"Not just yet, my dear; them is but the first labour pains; plenty of time\r\nto think of the hospital; we shall see how you are in a couple of hours."\r\n\r\n"Will it last so long as that?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be lucky if you get it over before midnight. I have been down for\r\nlonger than that."\r\n\r\n"Do you mind my stopping in the kitchen with you? I feel frightened when\r\nI\'m alone."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ll be glad of your company. I\'ll get you some tea presently."\r\n\r\n"I could not touch anything. Oh, this is dreadful!" she exclaimed, and she\r\nwalked to and fro holding her sides, balancing herself dolefully. Often\r\nMrs. Jones stopped in her work about the range and said, looking at her,\r\n"I know what it is, I have been through it many a time--we all must--it is\r\nour earthly lot." About seven o\'clock Esther was clinging to the table,\r\nand with pain so vivid on her face that Mrs. Jones laid aside the sausages\r\nshe was cooking and approached the suffering girl.\r\n\r\n"What! is it so bad as all that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," she said, "I think I\'m dying, I cannot stand up; give me a chair,\r\ngive me a chair!" and she sank down upon it, leaning across the table, her\r\nface and neck bathed in a cold sweat.\r\n\r\n"John will have to get his supper himself; I\'ll leave these sausages on\r\nthe hob, and run upstairs and put on my bonnet. The things you intend to\r\nbring with you, the baby clothes, are made up in a bundle, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\nLittle Mrs. Jones came running down; she threw a shawl over Esther, and it\r\nwas astonishing what support she lent to the suffering girl, calling on\r\nher the whole time to lean on her and not to be afraid. "Now then, dear,\r\nyou must keep your heart up, we have only a few yards further to go."\r\n\r\n"You are too good, you are too kind," Esther said, and she leaned against\r\nthe wall, and Mrs. Jones rang the bell.\r\n\r\n"Keep up your spirits; to-morrow it will be all over. I will come round\r\nand see how you are."\r\n\r\nThe door opened. The porter rang the bell, and a sister came running down.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, take my arm," she said, "and breathe hard as you are\r\nascending the stairs. Come along, you mustn\'t loiter."\r\n\r\nOn the second landing a door was thrown open, and she found herself in a\r\nroom full of people, eight or nine young men and women.\r\n\r\n"What! in there? and all those people?" said Esther.\r\n\r\n"Of course; those are the midwives and the students."\r\n\r\nShe saw that the screams she had heard in the passage came from a bed on\r\nthe left-hand side. A woman lay there huddled up. In the midst of her\r\nterror Esther was taken behind a screen by the sister who had brought her\r\nupstairs and quickly undressed. She was clothed in a chemise a great deal\r\ntoo big for her, and a jacket which was also many sizes too large. She\r\nremembered hearing the sister say so at the time. Both windows were wide\r\nopen, and as she walked across the room she noticed the basins on the\r\nfloor, the lamp on the round table, and the glint of steel instruments.\r\n\r\nThe students and the nurses were behind her; she knew they were eating\r\nsweets, for she heard a young man ask the young women if they would have\r\nany more fondants. Their chatter and laughter jarred on her nerves; but at\r\nthat moment her pains began again and she saw the young man whom she had\r\nseen handing the sweets approaching her bedside.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not him, not him!" she cried to the nurse. "Not him, not him! he\r\nis too young! Do not let him come near me!"\r\n\r\nThey laughed loudly, and she buried her head in the pillow, overcome with\r\npain and shame; and when she felt him by her she tried to rise from the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n"Let me go! take me away! Oh, you are all beasts!"\r\n\r\n"Come, come, no nonsense!" said the nurse; "you can\'t have what you like;\r\nthey are here to learn;" and when he had tried the pains she heard the\r\nmidwife say that it wasn\'t necessary to send for the doctor. Another said\r\nthat it would be all over in about three hours\' time. "An easy\r\nconfinement, I should say. The other will be more interesting...." Then\r\nthey talked of the plays they had seen, and those they wished to see. A\r\ndiscussion arose regarding the merits of a shilling novel which every one\r\nwas reading, and then Esther heard a stampede of nurses, midwives, and\r\nstudents in the direction of the window. A German band had come into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n"Is that the way to leave your patient, sister?" said the student who sat\r\nby Esther\'s bed, a good-looking boy with a fair, plump face. Esther looked\r\ninto his clear blue, girl-like eyes, wondered, and turned away for shame.\r\n\r\nThe sister stopped her imitation of a popular comedian, and said, "Oh,\r\nshe\'s all right; if they were all like her there\'d be very little use our\r\ncoming here."\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately that\'s just what they are," said another student, a stout\r\nfellow with a pointed red beard, the ends of which caught the light.\r\nEsther\'s eyes often went to those stubble ends, and she hated him for his\r\nloud voice and jocularity. One of the midwives, a woman with a long nose\r\nand small grey eyes, seemed to mock her, and Esther hoped that this woman\r\nwould not come near her. She felt that she could not bear her touch. There\r\nwas something sinister in her face, and Esther was glad when her\r\nfavourite, a little blond woman with wavy flaxen hair, came and asked her\r\nif she felt better. She looked a little like the young student who still\r\nsat by her bedside, and Esther wondered if they were brother and sister,\r\nand then she thought that they were sweethearts.\r\n\r\nSoon after a bell rang, and the students went down to supper, the nurse in\r\ncharge promising to warn them if any change should take place. The last\r\npains had so thoroughly exhausted her that she had fallen into a doze. But\r\nshe could hear the chatter of the nurses so clearly that she did not\r\nbelieve herself asleep. And in this film of sleep reality was distorted,\r\nand the unsuccessful operation which the nurses were discussing Esther\r\nunderstood to be a conspiracy against her life. She awoke, listened, and\r\ngradually sense of the truth returned to her. She was in the hospital....\r\nThe nurses were talking of some one who had died last week.... That poor\r\nwoman in the other bed seemed to suffer dreadfully. Would she live through\r\nit? Would she herself live to see the morning? How long the time, how\r\nfearful the place! If the nurses would only stop talking.... The pains\r\nwould soon begin again.... It was awful to lie listening, waiting. The\r\nwindows were open, and the mocking gaiety of the street was borne in on\r\nthe night wind. Then there came a trampling of feet and sound of voices in\r\nthe passage--the students and nurses were coming up from supper; and at\r\nthe same moment the pains began to creep up from her knees. One of the\r\nyoung men said that her time had not come. The woman with the sinister\r\nlook that Esther dreaded, held a contrary opinion. The point was argued,\r\nand, interested in the question, the crowd came from the window and\r\ncollected round the disputants. The young man expounded much medical and\r\nanatomical knowledge; the nurses listened with the usual deference of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the discussion was interrupted by a scream from Esther; it seemed\r\nto her that she was being torn asunder, that life was going from her. The\r\nnurse ran to her side, a look of triumph came upon her face, and she said,\r\n"Now we shall see who\'s right," and forthwith ran for the doctor. He came\r\nrunning up the stairs; immediately silence and scientific collectedness\r\ngathered round Esther, and after a brief examination he said, in a low\r\nwhisper--\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid this will not be as easy a case as one might have imagined. I\r\nshall administer chloroform."\r\n\r\nHe placed a small wire case over her mouth and nose, and the sickly odour\r\nwhich she breathed from the cotton wool filled her brain with nausea; it\r\nseemed to choke her, and then life faded, and at every inhalation she\r\nexpected to lose sight of the circle of faces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen she opened her eyes the doctors and nurses were still standing round\r\nher, but there was no longer any expression of eager interest on their\r\nfaces. She wondered at this change, and then out of the silence there came\r\na tiny cry.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" Esther asked.\r\n\r\n"That\'s your baby."\r\n\r\n"My baby! Let me see it; is it a boy or a girl?"\r\n\r\n"It is a boy; it will be given to you when we get you out of the labour\r\nward."\r\n\r\n"I knew it would be a boy." Then a scream of pain rent the stillness of\r\nthe room. "Is that the same woman who was here when I first came in?\r\nHasn\'t she been confined yet?"\r\n\r\n"No, and I don\'t think she will be till midday; she\'s very bad."\r\n\r\nThe door was thrown open, and Esther was wheeled into the passage. She was\r\nlike a convalescent plant trying to lift its leaves to the strengthening\r\nlight, but within this twilight of nature the thought of another life, now\r\nin the world, grew momentarily more distinct. "Where is my boy?" she said;\r\n"give him to me."\r\n\r\nThe nurse entered, and answered, "Here." A pulp of red flesh rolled up in\r\nflannel was laid alongside of her. Its eyes were open; it looked at her,\r\nand her flesh filled with a sense of happiness so deep and so intense that\r\nshe was like one enchanted. When she took the child in her arms she\r\nthought she must die of happiness. She did not hear the nurse speak, nor\r\ndid she understand her when she took the babe from her arms and laid it\r\nalongside on the pillow, saying, "You must let the little thing sleep, you\r\nmust try to sleep yourself."\r\n\r\nHer personal self seemed entirely withdrawn; she existed like an\r\natmosphere about the babe, an impersonal emanation of love. She lay\r\nabsorbed in this life of her life, this flesh of her flesh, unconscious of\r\nherself as a sponge in warm sea-water. She touched this pulp of life, and\r\nwas thrilled, and once more her senses swooned with love; it was still\r\nthere. She remembered that the nurse had said it was a boy. She must see\r\nher boy, and her hands, working as in a dream, unwound him, and, delirious\r\nwith love, she gazed until he awoke and cried. She tried to hush him and\r\nto enfold him, but her strength failed, she could not help him, and fear\r\ncame lest he should die. She strove to reach her hands to him, but all\r\nstrength had gone from her, and his cries sounded hollow in her weak\r\nbrain. Then the nurse came and said--\r\n\r\n"See what you have done, the poor child is all uncovered; no wonder he is\r\ncrying. I will wrap him up, and you must not interfere with him again."\r\nBut as soon as the nurse turned away Esther had her child back in her\r\narms. She did not sleep. She could not sleep for thinking of him, and the\r\nlong night passed in adoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was happy, her babe lay beside her. All her joints were loosened, and\r\nthe long hospital days passed in gentle weariness. Lady visitors came and\r\nasked questions. Esther said that her father and mother lived in the\r\nVauxhall Bridge Road, and she admitted that she had saved four pounds.\r\nThere were two beds in this ward, and the woman who occupied the second\r\nbed declared herself to be destitute, without home, or money, or friends.\r\nShe secured all sympathy and promises of help, and Esther was looked upon\r\nas a person who did not need assistance and ought to have known better.\r\nThey received visits from a clergyman. He spoke to Esther of God\'s\r\ngoodness and wisdom, but his exhortations seemed a little remote, and\r\nEsther was sad and ashamed that she was not more deeply stirred. Had it\r\nbeen her own people who came and knelt about her bed, lifting their voices\r\nin the plain prayers she was accustomed to, it might have been different;\r\nbut this well-to-do clergyman, with his sophisticated speech, seemed\r\nforeign to her, and failed to draw her thoughts from the sleeping child.\r\n\r\nThe ninth day passed, but Esther recovered slowly, and it was decided that\r\nshe should not leave the hospital before the end of the third week. She\r\nknew that when she crossed the threshold of the hospital there would be no\r\nmore peace for her; and she was frightened as she listened to the\r\nnever-ending rumble of the street. She spent whole hours thinking of her\r\ndear mother, and longing for some news from home, and her face brightened\r\nwhen she was told that her sister had come to see her.\r\n\r\n"Jenny, what has happened; is mother very bad?"\r\n\r\n"Mother is dead, that\'s what I\'ve come to tell you; I\'d have come before,\r\nbut----"\r\n\r\n"Mother dead! Oh, no, Jenny! Oh, Jenny, not my poor mother!"\r\n\r\n"Yes Esther. I knew it would cut you up dreadful; we was all very sorry,\r\nbut she\'s dead. She\'s dead a long time now, I was just a-going to tell\r\nyou----"\r\n\r\n"Jenny, what do you mean? Dead a long time?"\r\n\r\n"Well, she was buried more than a week ago. We were so sorry you couldn\'t\r\nbe at the funeral. We was all there, and had crape on our dresses and\r\nfather had crape on his \'at. We all cried, especially in church and about\r\nthe grave, and when the sexton threw in the soil it sounded that hollow it\r\nmade me sob. Julia, she lost her \'ead and asked to be buried with mother,\r\nand I had to lead her away; and then we went \'ome to dinner."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jenny, our poor mother gone from us for ever! How did she die? Tell\r\nme, was it a peaceful death? Did she suffer?"\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t much to tell. Mother was taken bad almost immediately after\r\nyou was with us the last time. Mother was that bad all the day long and\r\nall night too we could \'ardly stop in the \'ouse; it gave one just the\r\ncreeps to listen to her crying and moaning."\r\n\r\n"And then?"\r\n\r\n"Why, then the baby was born. It was dead, and mother died of weakness;\r\nprostration the doctor called it."\r\n\r\nEsther hid her face in the pillow. Jenny waited, and an anxious look of\r\nself began to appear on the vulgar London street face.\r\n\r\n"Look \'ere, Esther, you can cry when I\'ve gone; I\'ve a deal to say to yer\r\nand time is short."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jenny, don\'t speak like that! Father, was he kind to mother?"\r\n\r\n"I dunno that he thought much about it; he spent \'alf \'is time in the\r\npublic, \'e did. He said he couldn\'t abide the \'ouse with a woman\r\na-screaming like that. One of the neighbours came in to look after mother,\r\nand at last she had the doctor." Esther looked at her sister through\r\nstreaming tears, and the woman in the other bed alluded to the folly of\r\npoor women being confined "in their own \'omes--in a \'ome where there is a\r\ndrunken \'usband, and most \'omes is like that nowadays."\r\n\r\nAt that moment Esther\'s baby awoke crying for the breast. The little lips\r\ncaught at the nipple, the wee hand pressed the white curve, and in a\r\nmoment Esther\'s face took that expression of holy solicitude which Raphael\r\nsublimated in the Virgin\'s downward-gazing eyes. Jenny watched the\r\ngluttonous lips, interested in the spectacle, and yet absorbed in what she\r\nhad come to say to her sister.\r\n\r\n"Your baby do look \'ealthy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and he is too, not an ache or a pain. He\'s as beautiful a boy as\r\never lived. But think of poor mother, Jenny, think of poor mother."\r\n\r\n"I do think of her, Esther. But I can\'t help seeing your baby. He\'s like\r\nyou, Esther. I can see a look of you in \'is eyes. But I don\'t know that I\r\nshould care to \'ave a baby meself--the expense comes very \'eavy on a poor\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\n"Please God, my baby shall never want for anything as long as I can work\r\nfor him. But, Jenny, my trouble will be a lesson to you. I hope you will\r\nalways be a good girl, and never allow yourself to be led away; you\r\npromise me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I promise."\r\n\r\n"A \'ome like ours, a drunken father, and now that poor mother is gone it\r\nwill be worse than ever. Jenny, you are the eldest and must do your best\r\nto look after the younger ones, and as much as possible to keep father\r\nfrom the public-house. I shall be away; the moment I\'m well enough I must\r\nlook out for a place."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I came to speak to you about. Father is going to\r\nAustralia. He is that tired of England, and as he lost his situation on\r\nthe railway he has made up his mind to emigrate. It is pretty well all\r\narranged; he has been to an agency and they say he\'ll \'ave to pay two\r\npounds a \'ead, and that runs to a lot of money in a big family like ours.\r\nSo I\'m likely to get left, for father says that I\'m old enough to look\r\nafter myself. He\'s willing to take me if I gets the money, not without.\r\nThat\'s what I came to tell yer about."\r\n\r\nEsther understood that Jenny had come to ask for money. She could not give\r\nit, and lapsed into thinking of this sudden loss of all her family. She\r\ndid not know where Australia was; she fancied that she had once heard that\r\nit took months to get there. But she knew that they were all going from\r\nher, they were going out on the sea in a great ship that would sail and\r\nsail further and further away. She could see the ship from her bedside, at\r\nfirst strangely distinct, alive with hands and handkerchiefs; she could\r\ndistinguish all the children--Jenny, Julia, and little Ethel. She lost\r\nsight of their faces as the ship cleared the harbour. Soon after the ship\r\nwas far away on the great round of waters, again a little while and all\r\nthe streaming canvas not larger than a gull\'s wing, again a little while\r\nand the last speck on the horizon hesitated and disappeared.\r\n\r\n"What are you crying about, Esther? I never saw yer cry before. It do seem\r\nthat odd."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so weak. Mother\'s death has broken my heart, and now to know that I\r\nshall never see any one of you again."\r\n\r\n"It do seem \'ard. We shall miss you sadly. But I was going to say that\r\nfather can\'t take me unless I finds two pounds. You won\'t see me stranded,\r\nwill you, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot give you the money, Jenny. Father has had too much of my money\r\nalready; there\'s \'ardly enough to see me through. I\'ve only four pounds\r\nleft. I cannot give you my child\'s money; God knows how we shall live\r\nuntil I can get to work again."\r\n\r\n"You\'re nearly well now. But if yer can\'t help me, yer can\'t. I don\'t know\r\nwhat\'s to be done. Father can\'t take me if I don\'t find the money."\r\n\r\n"You say the agency wants two pounds for each person?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it."\r\n\r\n"And I\'ve four. We might both go if it weren\'t for the baby, but I don\'t\r\nsuppose they\'d make any charge for a child on the breast."\r\n\r\n"I dunno. There\'s father; yer know what he is."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true. He don\'t want me; I\'m not one of his. But, Jenny, dear, it\r\nis terrible to be left all alone. Poor mother dead, and all of you going\r\nto Australia. I shall never see one of you again."\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused. Esther changed the baby from the left to the\r\nright breast, and Jenny tried to think what she had best say to induce her\r\nsister to give her the money she wanted.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t give me the money I shall be left; it is hard luck, that\'s\r\nall, for there\'s fine chances for a girl, they says, out in Australia. If\r\nI remain \'ere I dunno what will become of me."\r\n\r\n"You had better look out for a situation. We shall see each other from\r\ntime to time. It\'s a pity you don\'t know a bit of cooking, enough to take\r\nthe place of kitchen-maid."\r\n\r\n"I only know that dog-making, and I\'ve \'ad enough of that."\r\n\r\n"You can always get a situation as general servant in a lodging-\'ouse."\r\n\r\n"Service in a lodging-\'ouse! Not me. You know what that is. I\'m surprised\r\nthat you\'d ask me."\r\n\r\n"Well, what are yer thinking of doing?"\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of going on in the pantomime as one of the hextra ladies,\r\nif they\'ll \'ave me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jenny, you won\'t do that, will you? A theatre is only sinfulness, as\r\nwe \'ave always knowed."\r\n\r\n"You know that I don\'t \'old with all them preachy-preachy brethren says\r\nabout the theatre."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t argue--I \'aven\'t the strength, and it interferes with the milk."\r\nAnd then, as if prompted by some association of ideas, Esther said, "I\r\nhope, Jenny, that you\'ll take example by me and will do nothing foolish;\r\nyou\'ll always be a good girl."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if I gets the chance."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to \'ear you speak like that, and poor mother only just dead."\r\n\r\nThe words that rose to Jenny\'s lips were: "A nice one you are, with a baby\r\nat your breast, to come a-lecturing me," but, fearing Esther\'s temper, she\r\nchecked the dangerous words and said instead--\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean that I was a-going on the streets right away this very\r\nevening, only that a girl left alone in London without anyone to look to\r\nmay go wrong in spite of herself, as it were."\r\n\r\n"A girl never need go wrong; if she does it is always \'er own fault."\r\nEsther spoke mechanically, but suddenly remembering her own circumstances\r\nshe said: "I\'d give you the money if I dared, but for the child\'s sake I\r\nmustn\'t."\r\n\r\n"You can afford it well enough--I wouldn\'t ask you if you couldn\'t. You\'ll\r\nbe earning a pound a week presently."\r\n\r\n"A pound a week! What do you mean, Jenny?"\r\n\r\n"Yer can get that as wet-nurse, and yer food too."\r\n\r\n"How do yer know that, Jenny?"\r\n\r\n"A friend of mine who was \'ere last year told me she got it, and you can\r\nget it too if yer likes. Fancy a pound for the next six months, and\r\neverything found. Yer might spare me the money and let me go to Australia\r\nwith the others."\r\n\r\n"I\'d give yer the money if what you said was true."\r\n\r\n"Yer can easily find out what I say is the truth by sending for the\r\nmatron. Shall I go and fetch her? I won\'t be a minute; you\'ll see what she\r\nsays."\r\n\r\nA few moments after Jenny returned with a good-looking, middle-aged woman.\r\nOn her face there was that testy and perplexed look that comes of much\r\nbusiness and many interruptions. Before she had opened her lips her face\r\nhad said: "Come, what is it? Be quick about it."\r\n\r\n"Father and the others is going to Australia. Mother\'s dead and was buried\r\nlast week, so father says there\'s nothing to keep \'im \'ere, for there is\r\nbetter prospects out there. But he says he can\'t take me, for the agency\r\nwants two pounds a \'ead, and it was all he could do to find the money for\r\nthe others. He is just short of two pounds, and as I\'m the eldest barring\r\nEsther, who is \'is step-daughter, \'e says that I had better remain, that\r\nI\'m old enough to get my own living, which is very \'ard on a girl, for I\'m\r\nonly just turned sixteen. So I thought that I would come up \'ere and tell\r\nmy sister----"\r\n\r\n"But, my good girl, what has all this got to do with me? I can\'t give you\r\ntwo pounds to go to Australia. You are only wasting my time for nothing."\r\n\r\n"\'Ear me out, missis. I want you to explain to my sister that you can get\r\nher a situation as a wet-nurse at a pound a week--that\'s the usual money\r\nthey gets, so I told her, but she won\'t believe me; but if you tells her,\r\nshe\'ll give me two pounds and I shall be able to go with father to\r\nAustralia, where they says there is fine chances for a girl."\r\n\r\nThe matron examined in critical disdain the vague skirt, the broken boots,\r\nand the misshapen hat, coming all the while to rapid conclusions regarding\r\nthe moral value of this unabashed child of the gutter.\r\n\r\n"I think your sister will be very foolish if she gives you her money."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t say that, missis, don\'t."\r\n\r\n"How does she know that your story is true? Perhaps you are not going to\r\nAustralia at all."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I\'m not--that\'s just what I\'m afraid of; but father is, and I can\r\nprove it to you. I\'ve brought a letter from father--\'ere it is; now, is\r\nthat good enough for yer?"\r\n\r\n"Come, no impertinence, or I\'ll order you out of the hospital in double\r\nquick time," said the matron.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t intend no impertinence," said Jenny humbly, "only I didn\'t like\r\nto be told I was telling lies when I was speaking the truth."\r\n\r\n"Well, I see that your father is going to Australia," the matron replied,\r\nreturning the letter to Jenny; "you want your sister to give you her money\r\nto take you there too."\r\n\r\n"What I wants is for you to tell my sister that you can get her a\r\nsituation as wet-nurse; then perhaps she\'ll give me the money."\r\n\r\n"If your sister wants to go out as wet-nurse, I daresay I could get her a\r\npound a week."\r\n\r\n"But," said Esther, "I should have to put baby out at nurse."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to do that in any case," Jenny interposed; "you can\'t live\r\nfor nine months on your savings and have all the nourishing food that\r\nyou\'ll want to keep your milk going."\r\n\r\n"If I was yer sister I\'d see yer further before I\'d give yer my money. You\r\nmust \'ave a cheek to come a-asking for it, to go off to Australia where a\r\ngirl \'as chances, and yer sister with a child at the breast left behind.\r\nWell I never!"\r\n\r\nJenny and the matron turned suddenly and looked at the woman in the\r\nopposite bed who had so unexpectedly expressed her views. Jenny was\r\nfurious.\r\n\r\n"What odds is it to you?" she screamed; "what business is it of yours,\r\ncoming poking your nose in my affairs?"\r\n\r\n"Come, now, I can\'t have any rowing," exclaimed the matron.\r\n\r\n"Rowing! I should like to know what business it is of \'ers."\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, I can\'t have you interfering with my patients; another word\r\nand I\'ll order you out of the hospital."\r\n\r\n"Horder me out of the horspital! and what for? Who began it? No, missis,\r\nbe fair; wait until my sister gives her answer."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, she must be quick about it--I can\'t wait about here all day."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give my sister the money to take her to Australia if you say you can\r\nget me a situation as wet-nurse."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think I can do that. It was four pounds five that you gave me to\r\nkeep. I remember the amount, for since I\'ve been here no one has come with\r\nhalf that. If they have five shillings they think they can buy half\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\n"My sister is very careful," said Jenny, sententiously. The matron looked\r\nsharply at her and said--\r\n\r\n"Now come along with me--I\'m going to fetch your sister\'s money. I can\'t\r\nleave you here--you\'d get quarrelling with my patients."\r\n\r\n"No, missis, indeed I won\'t say nothing to her."\r\n\r\n"Do as I tell you. Come along with me."\r\n\r\nSo with a passing scowl Jenny expressed her contempt for the woman who had\r\ncome "a-interfering in \'er business," and went after the matron, watching\r\nher every movement. When they came back Jenny\'s eyes were fixed on the\r\nmatron\'s fat hand as if she could see the yellow metal through the\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n"Here is your money," said the matron; "four pounds five. You can give\r\nyour sister what you like."\r\n\r\nEsther held the four sovereigns and the two half-crowns in her hand for a\r\nmoment, then she said--\r\n\r\n"Here, Jenny, are the two pounds you want to take you to Australia. I \'ope\r\nthey\'ll bring you good luck, and that you\'ll think of me sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I will, Esther. You\'ve been a good sister to me, indeed you \'ave;\r\nI shall never forget you, and will write to you.... It is very \'ard\r\nparting."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, never mind those tears. You have got your money; say good-bye\r\nto your sister and run along."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so \'eartless," cried Jenny, whose susceptibilities were now on\r\nthe move. "\'Ave yer no feeling; don\'t yer know what it is to bid good-bye\r\nto yer sister, and perhaps for ever?" Jenny flung herself into Esther\'s\r\narms crying bitterly. "Oh, Esther, I do love you; yer \'ave been that kind\r\nto me I shall never forget it. I shall be very lonely without you. Write\r\nto me sometimes; it will be a comfort to hear how you are getting on. If I\r\nmarry I\'ll send for you, and you\'ll bring the baby."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I\'d leave him behind? Kiss \'im before you go."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Esther; take care of yourself."\r\n\r\nEsther was now alone in the world, and she remembered the night she walked\r\nhome from the hospital and how cruel the city had seemed. She was now\r\nalone in that great wilderness with her child, for whom she would have to\r\nwork for many, many years. How would it all end? Would she be able to live\r\nthrough it? Had she done right in letting Jenny have the money--her boy\'s\r\nmoney? She should not have given it; but she hardly knew what she was\r\ndoing, she was so weak, and the news of her mother\'s death had overcome\r\nher. She should not have given Jenny her boy\'s money.... But perhaps it\r\nmight turn out all right after all. If the matron got her a situation as\r\nwet-nurse she\'d be able to pull through. "So they would separate us," she\r\nwhispered, bending over the sleeping child. "There is no help for it, my\r\npoor darling. There\'s no help for it, no help for it."\r\n\r\nNext day Esther was taken out of bed. She spent part of the afternoon\r\nsitting in an easy-chair, and Mrs. Jones came to see her. The little old\r\nwoman seemed like one whom she had known always, and Esther told her about\r\nher mother\'s death and the departure of her family for Australia. Perhaps\r\na week lay between her and the beginning of the struggle which she\r\ndreaded. She had been told that they did not usually keep anyone in the\r\nhospital more than a fortnight. Three days after Mrs. Jones\' visit the\r\nmatron came into their room hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry," she said, "but a number of new patients are expected;\r\nthere\'s nothing for it but to get rid of you. It is a pity, for I can see\r\nyou are both very weak."\r\n\r\n"What, me too?" said the woman in the other bed. "I can hardly stand; I\r\ntried just now to get across the room."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry, but we\'ve new patients coming, and there\'s all our spring\r\ncleaning. Have you any place to go to?"\r\n\r\n"No place except a lodging," said Esther; "and I have only two pounds five\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use in taking us at all if you fling us out on the street when\r\nwe can hardly walk?" said the other woman. "I wish I had gone and drowned\r\nmyself. I was very near doing it. If I had it would be all over now for me\r\nand the poor baby."\r\n\r\n"I\'m used to all this ingratitude," said the matron. "You have got through\r\nyour confinement very comfortably, and your baby is quite healthy; I hope\r\nyou\'ll try and keep it so. Have you any money?"\r\n\r\n"Only four-and-sixpence."\r\n\r\n"Have you got any friends to whom you can go?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll have to apply for admission to the workhouse."\r\n\r\nThe woman made no answer, and at that moment two sisters came and forcibly\r\nbegan to dress her. She fell back from time to time in their arms, almost\r\nfainting.\r\n\r\n"Lord, what a job!" said one sister; "she\'s just like so much lead in\r\none\'s arms. But if we listened to them we should have them loafing here\r\nover a month more." Esther did not require much assistance, and the sister\r\nsaid, "Oh, you are as strong as they make \'em; you might have gone two\r\ndays ago."\r\n\r\n"You\'re no better than brutes," Esther muttered. Then, turning to the\r\nmatron, she said, "You promised to get me a situation as wet-nurse."\r\n\r\n"Yes, so I did, but the lady who I intended to recommend you to wrote this\r\nmorning to say that she had suited herself."\r\n\r\n"But do you think you could get me a situation as wet-nurse?" said the\r\nother woman; "it would save me from going to the workhouse."\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know what to do with you all; you all want to stop in the\r\nhospital at least a month, eating and drinking the best of everything, and\r\nthen you want situations as wet-nurses at a pound a week."\r\n\r\n"But," said Esther, indignantly, "I never should have given my sister two\r\npounds if you had not told me you could get me the situation."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," said the matron, "to have to send you away. I should like to\r\nhave kept you, but really there is no help for it. As for the situation,\r\nI\'ll do the best I can. It is true that place I intended for you is filled\r\nup, but there will be another shortly, and you shall have the first. Give\r\nme your address. I shall not keep you long waiting, you can depend upon\r\nme. You are still very weak, I can see that. Would you like to have one of\r\nthe nurses to walk round with you? You had better--you might fall and hurt\r\nthe baby. My word, he is a fine boy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is a beautiful boy; it will break my heart to part with him."\r\n\r\nSome eight or nine poor girls stood outside, dressed alike in dingy\r\ngarments. They were like half-dead flies trying to crawl through an\r\nOctober afternoon; and with their babies and a keen wind blowing, they\r\nfound it difficult to hold on their hats.\r\n\r\n"It do catch you a bit rough, coming out of them \'ot rooms," said a woman\r\nstanding by her. "I\'m that weak I can \'ardly carry my baby. I dunno \'ow I\r\nshall get as far as the Edgware Road. I take my \'bus there. Are you going\r\nthat way?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m going close by, round the corner."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHer hair hung about her, her hands and wrists were shrunken, her flesh was\r\nsoft and flabby, and she had dark shadows in her face. Nursing her child\r\nseemed to draw all strength from her, and her nervous depression\r\nincreased; she was too weary and ill to think of the future, and for a\r\nwhole week her physical condition held her, to the exclusion of every\r\nother thought. Mrs. Jones was very kind, and only charged her ten\r\nshillings a week for her board and lodging, but this was a great deal when\r\nonly two pounds five shillings remained between her and the workhouse, and\r\nthis fact was brought home to her when Mrs. Jones came to her for the\r\nfirst week\'s money. Ten shillings gone; only one pound fifteen shillings\r\nleft, and still she was so weak that she could hardly get up and down\r\nstairs. But if she were twice as weak, if she had to crawl along the\r\nstreet on her hands and knees, she must go to the hospital and implore the\r\nmatron to get her a situation as wet-nurse. It was raining heavily, and\r\nMrs. Jones said it was madness for her to go out in such weather, but go\r\nshe must; and though it was distant only a few hundred yards, she often\r\nthought she would like to lie down and die. And at the hospital only\r\ndisappointment. Why hadn\'t she called yesterday? Yesterday two ladies of\r\ntitle had come and taken two girls away. Such a chance might not occur for\r\nsome time. "For some time," thought Esther; "very soon I shall have to\r\napply for admission at the workhouse." She reminded the matron of her\r\npromise, and returned home more dead than alive. Mrs. Jones helped her to\r\nchange her clothes, and bade her be of good heart. Esther looked at her\r\nhopelessly, and sitting down on the edge of her bed she put the baby to\r\nher breast.\r\n\r\nAnother week passed. She had been to the hospital every day, but no one\r\nhad been to inquire for a wet-nurse. Her money was reduced to a few\r\nshillings, and she tried to reconcile herself to the idea that she might\r\ndo worse than to accept the harsh shelter of the workhouse. Her nature\r\nrevolted against it; but she must do what was best for the child. She\r\noften asked herself how it would all end, and the more she thought, the\r\nmore terrible did the future seem. Her miserable meditations were\r\ninterrupted by a footstep on the stairs. It was Mrs. Jones, coming to tell\r\nher that a lady who wanted a wet-nurse had come from the hospital; and a\r\nlady entered dressed in a beautiful brown silk, and looked around the\r\nhumble room, clearly shocked at its poverty. Esther, who was sitting on\r\nthe bed, rose to meet the fine lady, a thin woman, with narrow temples,\r\naquiline features, bright eyes, and a disagreeable voice.\r\n\r\n"You are the young person who wants a situation as wet-nurse?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Are you married?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Is that your first child?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s a pity. But it doesn\'t matter much, so long as you and your\r\nbaby are healthy. Will you show it to me?"\r\n\r\n"He is asleep now, ma\'am," Esther said, raising the bed-clothes; "there\r\nnever was a healthier child."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he seems healthy enough. You have a good supply of milk?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Fifteen shillings, and all found. Does that suit you?"\r\n\r\n"I had expected a pound a week."\r\n\r\n"It is only your first baby. Fifteen shillings is quite enough. Of course\r\nI only engage you subject to the doctor\'s approval. I\'ll ask him to call."\r\n\r\n"Very well, ma\'am; I shall be glad of the place."\r\n\r\n"Then it is settled. You can come at once?"\r\n\r\n"I must arrange to put my baby out to nurse, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nThe lady\'s face clouded. But following up another train of thought, she\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Of course you must arrange about your baby, and I hope you\'ll make proper\r\narrangements. Tell the woman in whose charge you leave it that I shall\r\nwant to see it every three weeks. It will be better so," she added under\r\nher breath, "for two have died already."\r\n\r\n"This is my card," said the lady--"Mrs. Rivers, Curzon Street,\r\nMayfair--and I shall expect you to-morrow afternoon--that is to say, if\r\nthe doctor approves of you. Here is one-and-sixpence for your cab fare."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"I shall expect you not later than four o\'clock. I hope you won\'t\r\ndisappoint me; remember my child is waiting."\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Rivers left, Esther consulted with Mrs. Jones. The difficulty\r\nwas now where she should put the child out at nurse. It was now just after\r\ntwo o\'clock. The baby was fast asleep, and would want nothing for three or\r\nfour hours. It would be well for Esther to put on her hat and jacket and\r\ngo off at once. Mrs. Jones gave her the address of a respectable woman who\r\nused to take charge of children. But this woman was nursing twins, and\r\ncould not possibly undertake the charge of another baby. And Esther\r\nvisited many streets, always failing for one reason or another. At last\r\nshe found herself in Wandsworth, in a battered tumble-down little street,\r\nno thoroughfare, only four houses and a coal-shed. Broken wooden palings\r\nstood in front of the small area into which descent was made by means of a\r\nfew wooden steps. The wall opposite seemed to be the back of some stables,\r\nand in the area of No. 3 three little mites were playing. The baby was\r\ntied in a chair, and a short fat woman came out of the kitchen at Esther\'s\r\ncall, her dirty apron sloping over her high stomach, and her pale brown\r\nhair twisted into a knot at the top of her head.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"I came about putting a child out to nurse. You are Mrs. Spires, ain\'t\r\nyer?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s my name. May I ask who sent you?"\r\n\r\nEsther told her, and then Mrs. Spires asked her to step down into the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n"Them \'ere children you saw in the area I looks after while their mothers\r\nare out washing or charing. They takes them \'ome in the evening. I only\r\ncharges them four-pence a-day, and it is a loss at that, for they does\r\ntake a lot of minding. What age is yours?"\r\n\r\n"Mine is only a month old. I\'ve a chance to go out as wet-nurse if I can\r\nfind a place to put him out at nurse. Will you look after my baby?"\r\n\r\n"How much do you think of paying for him?"\r\n\r\n"Five shillings a week."\r\n\r\n"And you a-going out as wet-nurse at a pound a week; you can afford more\r\nthan that."\r\n\r\n"I\'m only getting fifteen shillings a week."\r\n\r\n"Well, you can afford to pay six. I tell you the responsibility I of\r\nlooking after a hinfant is that awful nowadays that I don\'t care to\r\nundertake it for less."\r\n\r\nEsther hesitated; she did not like this woman.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," said the woman, altering her tone to one of mild\r\ninterrogation, "you would like your baby to have the best of everything,\r\nand not the drainings of any bottle that\'s handy?"\r\n\r\n"I should like my child to be well looked after, and I must see the child\r\nevery three weeks."\r\n\r\n"Do you expect me to bring up the child to wherever the lady lives, and\r\npay my \'bus fare, all out of five shillings a week? It can\'t be done!"\r\nEsther did not answer. "You ain\'t married, of course?" Mrs. Spires said\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n"No, I ain\'t; what about that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing; there is so many of you, that\'s all. You can\'t lay yer \'and\r\non the father and get a bit out of \'im?"\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused. Esther felt strangely undecided. She looked round\r\nsuspiciously, and noticing the look the woman said--\r\n\r\n"Your baby will be well looked after \'ere; a nice warm kitchen, and I\'ve\r\nno other babies for the moment; them children don\'t give no trouble, they\r\nplays in the area. You had better let me have the child; you won\'t do\r\nbetter than \'ere."\r\n\r\nEsther promised to think it over and let her know to-morrow. It took her\r\nmany omnibuses to get home, and it was quite dark when she pushed the door\r\nto. The first thing that caught her ear was her child crying. "What is the\r\nmatter?" she cried, hurrying down the passage.\r\n\r\n"Oh, is that you? You have been away a time. The poor child is that hungry\r\nhe has been crying this hour or more. If I\'d \'ad a bottle I\'d \'ave given\r\nhim a little milk."\r\n\r\n"Hungry, is he? Then he shall have plenty soon. It is nearly the last time\r\nI shall nurse the poor darling." Then she told Mrs. Jones about Mrs.\r\nSpires, and both women tried to arrive at a decision.\r\n\r\n"Since you have to put the child out to nurse, you might as well put him\r\nthere as elsewhere; the woman will look after him as well as she\r\ncan--she\'ll do that, if it is for the sake of the six shillings a week."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I know; but I\'ve always heard that children die that are put\r\nout to nurse. If mine died I never should forgive myself."\r\n\r\nShe could not sleep; she lay with her arms about her baby, distracted at\r\nthe thought of parting from him. What had she done that her baby should be\r\nseparated from her? What had the poor little darling done? He at least was\r\ninnocent; why should he be deprived of his mother? At midnight she got up\r\nand lighted a candle, looked at him, took him in her arms, squeezed him to\r\nher bosom till he cried, and the thought came that it would be sweeter to\r\nkill him with her own hands than to be parted from him.\r\n\r\nThe thought of murder went with the night, and she enjoyed the journey to\r\nWandsworth. Her baby laughed and cooed, and was much admired in the\r\nomnibus, and the little street where Mrs. Spires lived seemed different. A\r\ncart of hay was being unloaded, and this gave the place a pleasant rural\r\nair. Mrs. Spires, too, was cleaner, tidier; Esther no longer disliked her;\r\nshe had a nice little cot ready for the baby, and he seemed so comfortable\r\nin it that Esther did not feel the pangs at parting which she had expected\r\nto feel. She would see him in a few weeks, and in those weeks she would be\r\nricher. It seemed quite wonderful to earn so much money in so short a\r\ntime. She had had a great deal of bad luck, but her luck seemed to have\r\nturned at last. So engrossed was she in the consideration of her good\r\nfortune that she nearly forgot to get out of her \'bus at Charing Cross,\r\nand had it not been for the attention of the conductor might have gone on,\r\nshe did not know where--perhaps to Clerkenwell, or may be to Islington.\r\nWhen the second \'bus turned into Oxford Street she got out, not wishing to\r\nspend more money than was necessary. Mrs. Jones approved of all she had\r\ndone, helped her to pack up her box, and sent her away with many kind\r\nwishes to Curzon Street in a cab.\r\n\r\nEsther was full of the adventure and the golden prospect before her. She\r\nwondered if the house she was going to was as grand as Woodview, and she\r\nwas struck by the appearance of the maidservant who opened the door to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Oh, here you are," Mrs. Rivers said. "I have been anxiously expecting\r\nyou; my baby is not at all well. Come up to the nursery at once. I don\'t\r\nknow your name," she said, turning to Esther.\r\n\r\n"Waters, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Emily, you\'ll see that Waters\' box is taken to her room."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see to it, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Then come up at once, Waters. I hope you\'ll succeed better than the\r\nothers."\r\n\r\nA tall, handsome gentleman stood at the door of a room full of beautiful\r\nthings, and as they went past him Mrs. Rivers said, "This is the new\r\nnurse, dear." Higher up, Esther saw a bedroom of soft hangings and bright\r\nporcelain. Then another staircase, and the little wail of a child caught\r\non the ear, and Mrs. Rivers said, "The poor little thing; it never ceases\r\ncrying. Take it, Waters, take it."\r\n\r\nEsther sat down, and soon the little thing ceased crying.\r\n\r\n"It seems to take to you," said the anxious mother.\r\n\r\n"So it seems," said Esther; "it is a wee thing, not half the size of my\r\nboy."\r\n\r\n"I hope the milk will suit it, and that it won\'t bring up what it takes.\r\nThis is our last chance."\r\n\r\n"I daresay it will come round, ma\'am. I suppose you weren\'t strong enough\r\nto nurse it yourself, and yet you looks healthy."\r\n\r\n"I? No, I could not undertake to nurse it." Then, glancing suspiciously at\r\nEsther, whose breast was like a little cup, Mrs. Rivers said, "I hope you\r\nhave plenty of milk?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, ma\'am; they said at the hospital I could bring up twins."\r\n\r\n"Your supper will be ready at nine. But that will be a long time for you\r\nto wait. I told them to cut you some sandwiches, and you\'ll have a glass\r\nof porter. Or perhaps you\'d prefer to wait till supper? You can have your\r\nsupper, you know, at eight, if you like?"\r\n\r\nEsther took a sandwich and Mrs. Rivers poured out a glass of porter. And\r\nlater in the evening Mrs. Rivers came down from her drawing-room to see\r\nthat Esther\'s supper was all right, and not satisfied with the handsome\r\nfare that had been laid before her child\'s nurse, she went into the\r\nkitchen and gave strict orders that the meat for the future was not to be\r\nquite so much cooked.\r\n\r\nHenceforth it seemed to Esther that she was eating all day. The food was\r\ndoubtless necessary after the great trial of the flesh she had been\r\nthrough, likewise pleasant after her long abstinences. She grew happy in\r\nthe tide of new blood flowing in her veins, and might easily have\r\nabandoned herself in the seduction of these carnal influences. But her\r\nmoral nature was of tough fibre, and made mute revolt. Such constant\r\nmealing did not seem natural, and the obtuse brain of this lowly\r\nservant-girl was perplexed. Her self-respect was wounded; she hated her\r\nposition in this house, and sought consolation in the thought that she was\r\nearning good money for her baby. She noticed, too, that she never was\r\nallowed out alone, and that her walks were limited to just sufficient\r\nexercise to keep her in health.\r\n\r\nA fortnight passed, and one afternoon, after having put baby to sleep, she\r\nsaid to Mrs. Rivers, "I hope, ma\'am, you\'ll be able to spare me for a\r\ncouple of hours; baby won\'t want me before then. I\'m very anxious about my\r\nlittle one."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nurse, I couldn\'t possibly hear of it; such a thing is never allowed.\r\nYou can write to the woman, if you like."\r\n\r\n"I do not know how to write, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Then you can get some one to write for you. But your baby is no doubt all\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"But, ma\'am, you are uneasy about your baby; you are up in the nursery\r\ntwenty times a day; it is only natural I should be uneasy about mine."\r\n\r\n"But, nurse, I\'ve no one to send with you."\r\n\r\n"There is no reason why any one should go with me, ma\'am; I can take care\r\nof myself."\r\n\r\n"What! let you go off all the way to--where did you say you had left\r\nit--Wandsworth?--by yourself! I really couldn\'t think of it. I don\'t want\r\nto be unnecessarily hard--but I really couldn\'t--no mother could. I must\r\nconsider the interests of my child. But I don\'t want you to agitate\r\nyourself, and if you like I\'ll write myself to the woman who has charge of\r\nyour baby. I cannot do more, and I hope you\'ll be satisfied."\r\n\r\nBy what right, by what law, was she separated from her child? She was\r\ntired of hearing Mrs. Rivers speak of "my child, my child, my child," and\r\nof seeing this fine lady turn up her nose when she spoke of her own\r\nbeautiful boy. When Mrs. Rivers came to engage her she had said that it\r\nwould be better for the baby to be brought to see her every three or four\r\nweeks, for two had died already. At the time Esther had not understood.\r\nShe had supposed vaguely, in a passing way, that Mrs. Rivers had already\r\nlost two children. But yesterday the housemaid had told her that that\r\nlittle thing in the cradle had had two wet-nurses before Esther, and that\r\nboth babies had died. It was then a life for a life. It was more. The\r\nchildren of two poor girls had been sacrificed so that this rich woman\'s\r\nchild might be saved. Even that was not enough, the life of her beautiful\r\nboy was called for. Then other memories swept into Esther\'s frenzied\r\nbrain. She remembered vague hints, allusions that Mrs. Spires had thrown\r\nout; and as if in the obtuseness of a nightmare, it seemed to this\r\nignorant girl that she was the victim of a dark and far-reaching\r\nconspiracy; she experienced the sensation of the captured animal, and she\r\nscanned the doors and windows, thinking of some means of escape.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a knock was heard and the housemaid came in.\r\n\r\n"The woman who has charge of your baby has come to see you."\r\n\r\nEsther started up from her chair, and fat little Mrs. Spires waddled into\r\nthe room, the ends of her shawl touching the ground.\r\n\r\n"Where is my baby?" said Esther. "Why haven\'t you brought him?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you see, my dear, the sweet little thing didn\'t seem as well as\r\nusual this afternoon, and I did not care to bring him out, it being a long\r\nway and a trifle cold.... It is nice and warm in here. May I sit down?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there\'s a chair; but tell me what is the matter with him?"\r\n\r\n"A little cold, dear--nothing to speak of. You must not excite yourself,\r\nit isn\'t worth while; besides, it\'s bad for you and the little darling in\r\nthe cradle. May I have a look?... A little girl, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is a girl."\r\n\r\n"And a beautiful little girl too. \'Ow \'ealthy she do look! I\'ll be bound\r\nyou have made a difference in her. I suppose you are beginning to like her\r\njust as if she was your own?"\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Yer know, all you girls are dreadful taken with their babies at first.\r\nBut they is a awful drag on a girl who gets her living in service. For my\r\npart I do think it providential-like that rich folk don\'t nurse their own.\r\nIf they did, I dunno what would become of all you poor girls. The\r\nsituation of wet-nurse is just what you wants at the time, and it is good\r\nmoney. I hope yer did what I told you and stuck out for a pound a week.\r\nRich folk like these here would think nothing of a pound a week, nor yet\r\ntwo, when they sees their child is suited."\r\n\r\n"Never mind about my money, that\'s my affair. Tell me what\'s the matter\r\nwith my baby?"\r\n\r\n"\'Ow yer do \'arp on it! I\'ve told yer that \'e\'s all right; nothing to\r\nsignify, only a little poorly, but knowing you was that anxious I thought\r\nit better to come up. I didn\'t know but what you might like to \'ave in the\r\ndoctor."\r\n\r\n"Does he require the doctor? I thought you said it was nothing to\r\nsignify."\r\n\r\n"That depends on \'ow yer looks at it. Some likes to \'ave in the doctor,\r\nhowever little the ailing; then others won\'t \'ave anything to do with\r\ndoctors--don\'t believe in them. So I thought I\'d come up and see what you\r\nthought about it. I would \'ave sent for the doctor this morning--I\'m one\r\nof those who \'as faith in doctors--but being a bit short of money I\r\nthought I\'d come up and ask you for a trifle."\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mrs. Rivers came into the nursery and her first look went\r\nin the direction of the cradle, then she turned to consider curtseying\r\nMrs. Spires.\r\n\r\n"This is Mrs. Spires, the lady who is looking after my baby, ma\'am," said\r\nEsther; "she has come with bad news--my baby is ill."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m sorry. But I daresay it is nothing."\r\n\r\n"But Mrs. Spires says, ma\'am----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am, the little thing seemed a bit poorly, and I being short of\r\nmoney, ma\'am, I had to come and see nurse. I knows right well that they\r\nmust not be disturbed, and of course your child\'s \'ealth is everything;\r\nbut if I may make so bold I\'d like to say that the little dear do look\r\nbeautiful. Nurse is bringing her up that well that yer must have every\r\nsatisfaction in \'er."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she seems to suit the child; that\'s the reason I don\'t want her\r\nupset."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t occur again, ma\'am, I promise you."\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer, and her white, sullen face remained unchanged. She\r\nhad a great deal on her mind, and would have spoken if the words did not\r\nseem to betray her when she attempted to speak.\r\n\r\n"When the baby is well, and the doctor is satisfied there is no danger of\r\ninfection, you can bring it here--once a month will be sufficient. Is\r\nthere anything more?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Spires thinks my baby ought to see the doctor."\r\n\r\n"Well, let her send for the doctor."\r\n\r\n"Being a bit short of money----"\r\n\r\n"How much is it?" said Esther.\r\n\r\n"Well, what we pays is five shillings to the doctor, but then there\'s the\r\nmedicine he will order, and I was going to speak to you about a piece of\r\nflannel; if yer could let me have ten shillings to go on with."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t so much left. I must see my baby," and Esther moved towards\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"No, no, nurse, I cannot hear of it; I\'d sooner pay the money myself. Now,\r\nhow much do you want, Mrs. Spires?"\r\n\r\n"Ten shillings will do for the present, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Here they are; let the child have every attendance, and remember you are\r\nnot to come troubling my nurse. Above all, you are not to come up to the\r\nnursery. I don\'t know how it happened, it was a mistake on the part of the\r\nnew housemaid. You must have my permission before you see my nurse." And\r\nwhile talking rapidly and imperatively Mrs. Rivers, as it were, drove Mrs.\r\nSpires out of the nursery. Esther could hear them talking on the\r\nstaircase, and she listened, all the while striving to collect her\r\nthoughts. Mrs. Rivers said when she returned, "I really cannot allow her\r\nto come here upsetting you." Then, as if impressed by the sombre look on\r\nEsther\'s face, she added: "Upsetting you about nothing. I assure you it\r\nwill be all right; only a little indisposition."\r\n\r\n"I must see my baby," Esther replied.\r\n\r\n"Come, nurse, you shall see your baby the moment the doctor says it is fit\r\nto come here. You can\'t expect me to do more than that." Esther did not\r\nmove, and thinking that it would not be well to argue with her, Mrs.\r\nRivers went over to the cradle. "See, nurse, the little darling has just\r\nwoke up; come and take her, I\'m sure she wants you."\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer her. She stood looking into space, and it seemed to\r\nMrs. Rivers that it would be better not to provoke a scene. She went\r\ntowards the door slowly, but a little cry from the cradle stopped her, and\r\nshe said--\r\n\r\n"Come, nurse, what is it? Come, the baby is waiting for you."\r\n\r\nThen, like one waking from a dream, Esther said: "If my baby is all right,\r\nma\'am, I\'ll come back, but if he wants me, I\'ll have to look after him\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"You forget that I\'m paying you fifteen shillings a week. I pay you for\r\nnursing my baby; you take my money, that\'s sufficient."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do take your money, ma\'am. But the housemaid has told me that you\r\nhad two wet-nurses before me, and that both their babies died, so I cannot\r\nstop here now that mine\'s ill. Everyone for her own; you can\'t blame me.\r\nI\'m sorry for yours--poor little thing, she was getting on nicely too."\r\n\r\n"But, Waters, you won\'t leave my baby. It\'s cruel of you. If I could nurse\r\nit myself----"\r\n\r\n"Why couldn\'t you, ma\'am? You look fairly strong and healthy."\r\n\r\nEsther spoke in her quiet, stolid way, finding her words unconsciously.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what you\'re saying, nurse; you can\'t.... You\'ve forgotten\r\nyourself. Next time I engage a nurse I\'ll try to get one who has lost her\r\nbaby, and then there\'ll be no bother."\r\n\r\n"It is a life for a life--more than that, ma\'am--two lives for a life; and\r\nnow the life of my boy is asked for."\r\n\r\nA strange look passed over Mrs. Rivers\' face. She knew, of course, that\r\nshe stood well within the law, that she was doing no more than a hundred\r\nother fashionable women were doing at the same moment; but this plain girl\r\nhad a plain way of putting things, and she did not care for it to be\r\npublicly known that the life of her child had been bought with the lives\r\nof two poor children. But her temper was getting the better of her.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll only be a drag on you. You\'ll never be able to bring him up, poor\r\nlittle bastard child."\r\n\r\n"It is wicked of you to speak like that, ma\'am, though it is I who am\r\nsaying it. It is none of the child\'s fault if he hasn\'t got a father, nor\r\nis it right that he should be deserted for that... and it is not for you\r\nto tell me to do such a thing. If you had made sacrifice of yourself in\r\nthe beginning and nursed your own child such thoughts would not have come\r\nto you. But when you hire a poor girl such as me to give the milk that\r\nbelongs to another to your child, you think nothing of the poor deserted\r\none. He is but a bastard, you say, and had better be dead and done with. I\r\nsee it all now; I have been thinking it out. It is all so hidden up that\r\nthe meaning is not clear at first, but what it comes to is this, that fine\r\nfolks like you pays the money, and Mrs. Spires and her like gets rid of\r\nthe poor little things. Change the milk a few times, a little neglect, and\r\nthe poor servant girl is spared the trouble of bringing up her baby and\r\ncan make a handsome child of the rich woman\'s little starveling."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the baby began to cry; both women looked in the direction\r\nof the cradle.\r\n\r\n"Nurse, you have utterly forgotten yourself, you have talked a great deal\r\nof nonsense, you have said a great deal that is untrue. You accused me of\r\nwishing your baby were dead, indeed I hardly know what wild remarks you\r\ndid not indulge in. Of course, I cannot put up with such\r\nconduct--to-morrow you will come to me and apologise. In the meantime the\r\nbaby wants you, are you not going to her?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to my own child."\r\n\r\n"That means that you refuse to nurse my baby?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m going straight to look after my own."\r\n\r\n"If you leave my house you shall never enter it again."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to enter it again."\r\n\r\n"I shall not pay you one shilling if you leave my baby. You have no\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"I shall try to manage without. I shall go with my baby to the workhouse.\r\nHowever bad the living may be there, he\'ll be with his mother."\r\n\r\n"If you go to-night my baby will die. She cannot be brought up on the\r\nbottle."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope not, ma\'am. I should be sorry, indeed I should."\r\n\r\n"Then stay, nurse."\r\n\r\n"I must go to my baby, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Then you shall go at once--this very instant."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going this very instant, as soon as I\'ve put on my hat and jacket."\r\n\r\n"You had better take your box with you. If you don\'t I\'ll shall have it\r\nthrown into the street."\r\n\r\n"I daresay you\'re cruel enough to do that if the law allows you, only be\r\ncareful that it do."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment Esther got out of the house in Curzon Street she felt in her\r\npocket for her money. She had only a few pence; enough for her \'bus fare,\r\nhowever, and her thoughts did not go further. She was absorbed by one\r\ndesire, how to save her child--how to save him from Mrs. Spires, whom she\r\nvaguely suspected; from the world, which called him a bastard and denied\r\nto him the right to live. And she sat as if petrified in the corner of the\r\n\'bus, seeing nothing but a little street of four houses, facing some\r\nhaylofts, the low-pitched kitchen, the fat woman, the cradle in the\r\ncorner. The intensity and the oneness of her desire seemed to annihilate\r\ntime, and when she got out of the omnibus she walked with a sort of\r\nanimal-like instinct straight for the house. There was a light in the\r\nkitchen just as she expected, and as she descended the four wooden steps\r\ninto the area she looked to see if Mrs. Spires was there. She was there,\r\nand Esther pushed open the door.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s my baby?"\r\n\r\n"Lord, \'ow yer did frighten me!" said Mrs. Spires, turning from the range\r\nand leaning against the table, which was laid for supper. "Coming like\r\nthat into other folk\'s places without a word of warning--without as much\r\nas knocking at the door."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, but I was that anxious about my baby."\r\n\r\n"Was you indeed? It is easy to see it is the first one. There it is in the\r\ncradle there."\r\n\r\n"Have you sent for the doctor?"\r\n\r\n"Sent for the doctor! I\'ve to get my husband\'s supper."\r\n\r\nEsther took her baby out of the cradle. It woke up crying, and Esther\r\nsaid, "You don\'t mind my sitting down a moment. The poor little thing\r\nwants its mother."\r\n\r\n"If Mrs. Rivers saw you now a-nursing of yer baby?"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t care if she did. He\'s thinner than when I left him; ten days\r\n\'ave made a difference in him."\r\n\r\n"Well, yer don\'t expect a child to do as well without its mother as with\r\nher. But tell me, how did yer get out? You must have come away shortly\r\nafter me."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t going to stop there and my child ill."\r\n\r\n"Yer don\'t mean to tell me that yer \'ave gone and thrown hup the\r\nsituation?"\r\n\r\n"She told me if I went out, I should never enter her door again."\r\n\r\n"And what did you say?"\r\n\r\n"Told her I didn\'t want to."\r\n\r\n"And what, may I ask, are yer thinking of doing? I \'eard yer say yer \'ad\r\nno money."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Take my advice, and go straight back and ask \'er to overlook it, this\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, she\'d never take me back."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she will; you suits the child, and that\'s all they think of."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what will become of me and my baby."\r\n\r\n"No more don\'t I. Yer can\'t stop always in the work\'us, and a baby\'ll be a\r\n\'eavy drag on you. Can\'t you lay \'ands on \'is father, some\'ow?"\r\n\r\nEsther shook her head, and Mrs. Spires noticed that she was crying.\r\n\r\n"I\'m all alone," she said; "I don\'t know \'ow I\'m ever to pull through."\r\n\r\n"Not with that child yer won\'t--it ain\'t possible.... You girls is all\r\nalike, yer thinks of nothing but yer babies for the first few weeks, then\r\nyer tires of them, the drag on yer is that \'eavy--I knows yer--and then\r\nyer begins to wish they \'ad never been born, or yer wishes they had died\r\nafore they knew they was alive. I don\'t say I\'m not often sorry for them,\r\npoor little dears, but they takes less notice than you\'d think for, and\r\nthey is better out of the way; they really is, it saves a lot of trouble\r\nhereafter. I often do think that to neglect them, to let them go off\r\nquiet, that I be their best friend; not wilful neglect, yer know, but what\r\nis a woman to do with ten or a dozen, and I often \'as as many? I am sure\r\nthey\'d thank me for it."\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer, but judging by her face that she had lost all hope,\r\nMrs. Spires was tempted to continue.\r\n\r\n"There\'s that other baby in the far corner, that was brought \'ere since\r\nyou was \'ere by a servant-girl like yerself. She\'s out a\'nursing of a\r\nlady\'s child, getting a pound a week, just as you was; well, now I asks\r\n\'ow she can \'ope to bring up that \'ere child--a weakly little thing that\r\nwants the doctor and all sorts of looking after. If that child was to live\r\nit would be the ruin of that girl\'s life. Don\'t yer \'ear what I\'m saying?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I hear," said Esther, speaking like one in a dream; "don\'t she care\r\nfor her baby, then?"\r\n\r\n"She used to care for them, but if they had all lived I should like to\r\nknow where she\'d be. There \'as been five of them--that\'s the fifth--so,\r\ninstead of them a-costing \'er money, they brings \'er money. She \'as never\r\nfailed yet to suit \'erself in a situation as wet-nurse."\r\n\r\n"And they all died?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, they all died; and this little one don\'t look as if it was long for\r\nthe world, do it?" said Mrs. Spires, who had taken the infant from the\r\ncradle to show Esther. Esther looked at the poor wizened features,\r\ntwitched with pain, and the far-off cry of doom, a tiny tinkle from the\r\nverge, shivered in the ear with a strange pathos.\r\n\r\n"It goes to my \'eart," said Mrs. Spires, "it do indeed, but, Lord, it is\r\nthe best that could \'appen to \'em; who\'s to care for \'em? and there is\r\n\'undreds and \'undreds of them--ay, thousands and thousands every year--and\r\nthey all dies like the early shoots. It is \'ard, very \'ard, poor little\r\ndears, but they is best out of the way--they is only an expense and a\r\ndisgrace."\r\n\r\nMrs. Spires talked on in a rapid, soothing, soporific voice. She had just\r\nfinished pouring some milk in the baby\'s bottle and had taken down a jug\r\nof water from the dresser.\r\n\r\n"But that\'s cold water," said Esther, waking from the stupor of her\r\ndespair; "it will give the baby gripes for certain."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no \'ot water ready; I\'ll let the bottle stand afore the fire,\r\nthat\'ll do as well." Watching Esther all the while, Mrs. Spires held the\r\nbottle a few moments before the fire, and then gave it to the child to\r\nsuck. Very soon after a cry of pain came from the cradle.\r\n\r\n"The little dear never was well; it wouldn\'t surprise me a bit if it\r\ndied--went off before morning. It do look that poorly. One can\'t \'elp\r\nbeing sorry for them, though one knows there is no \'ouse for them \'ere.\r\nPoor little angels, and not even baptised. There\'s them that thinks a lot\r\nof getting that over. But who\'s to baptise the little angels?"\r\n\r\n"Baptise them?" Esther repeated. "Oh, sprinkle them, you mean. That\'s not\r\nthe way with the Lord\'s people;" and to escape from a too overpowering\r\nreality she continued to repeat the half-forgotten patter of the Brethren,\r\n"You must wait until it is a symbol of living faith in the Lord!" And\r\ntaking the baby in her hands for a moment, the wonder crossed her mind\r\nwhether he would ever grow up and find salvation and testify to the Lord\r\nas an adult in voluntary baptism.\r\n\r\nAll the while Mrs. Spires was getting on with her cooking. Several times\r\nshe looked as if she were going to speak, and several times she checked\r\nherself. In truth, she didn\'t know what to make of Esther. Was her love of\r\nher child such love as would enable her to put up with all hardships for\r\nits sake, or was it the fleeting affection of the ordinary young mother,\r\nwhich, though ardent at first, gives way under difficulties? Mrs. Spires\r\nhad heard many mothers talk as Esther talked, but when the real strain of\r\nlife was put upon them they had yielded to the temptation of ridding\r\nthemselves of their burdens. So Mrs. Spires could not believe that Esther\r\nwas really different from the others, and if carefully handled she would\r\ndo what the others had done. Still, there was something in Esther which\r\nkept Mrs. Spires from making any distinct proposal. But it were a pity to\r\nlet the girl slip through her fingers--five pounds were not picked up\r\nevery day. There were three five-pound notes in the cradles. If Esther\r\nwould listen to reason there would be twenty pounds, and the money was\r\nwanted badly. Once more greed set Mrs. Spires\' tongue flowing, and,\r\nrepresenting herself as a sort of guardian angel, she spoke again about\r\nthe mother of the dying child, pressing Esther to think what the girl\'s\r\ncircumstances would have been if they had all lived.\r\n\r\n"And they all died?" said Esther.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and a good job, too," said Mrs. Spires, whose temper for the moment\r\noutsped her discretion. Was this penniless drab doing it on purpose to\r\nannoy her? A nice one indeed to high-and-mighty it over her. She would\r\nshow her in mighty quick time she had come to the wrong shop. Just as Mrs.\r\nSpires was about to speak out she noticed that Esther was in tears. Mrs.\r\nSpires always looked upon tears as a good sign, so she resolved to give\r\nher one more chance. "What are you crying about?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Esther, "I don\'t even know where I shall sleep tonight. I have\r\nonly threepence, and not a friend in the world."\r\n\r\n"Now look \'ere, if you\'ll listen to reason I\'ll talk to you. Yer mustn\'t\r\nlook upon me as a henemy. I\'ve been a good friend to many a poor girl like\r\nyou afore now, and I\'ll be one to you if you\'re sensible. I\'ll do for you\r\nwhat I\'m doing for the other girl. Give me five pounds--"\r\n\r\n"Five pounds! I\'ve only a few pence."\r\n\r\n"\'Ear me out. Go back to yer situation--she\'ll take you back, yer suits\r\nthe child, that\'s all she cares about; ask \'er for an advance of five\r\npounds; she\'ll give it when she \'ears it is to get rid of yer child--they\r\n\'ates their nurses to be a-\'ankering after their own, they likes them to\r\nbe forgotten like; they asks if the child is dead very often, and won\'t\r\nengage them if it isn\'t, so believe me she\'ll give yer the money when yer\r\ntells \'er that it is to give the child to someone who wants to adopt it.\r\nThat\'s what you \'as to say."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll take the child off my hands for ever for five pounds?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and if you likes to go out again as wet-nurse, I\'ll take the second\r\noff yer \'ands too, and at the same price."\r\n\r\n"You wicked woman; oh, this is awful!"\r\n\r\n"Come, come.... What do you mean by talking to me like that? And because I\r\noffered to find someone who would adopt your child."\r\n\r\n"You did nothing of the kind; ever since I\'ve been in your house you have\r\nbeen trying to get me to give you up my child to murder as you are\r\nmurdering those poor innocents in the cradles."\r\n\r\n"It is a lie, but I don\'t want no hargument with yer; pay me what you owe\r\nme and take yerself hoff. I want no more of yer, do you \'ear?"\r\n\r\nEsther did not shrink before her as Mrs. Spires expected. Clasping her\r\nbaby more tightly, she said: "I\'ve paid you what I owe you, you\'ve had\r\nmore than your due. Mrs. Rivers gave you ten shillings for a doctor which\r\nyou didn\'t send for. Let me go."\r\n\r\n"Yes, when yer pays me."\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this row about?" said a tall, red-bearded man who had just\r\ncome in; "no one takes their babies out of this \'ere \'ouse before they\r\npays. Come now, come now, who are yer getting at? If yer thinks yer can\r\ncome here insulting of my wife yer mistaken; yer\'ve come to the wrong\r\nshop."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve paid all I owe," said Esther. "You\'re no better than murderers, but\r\nyer shan\'t have my poor babe to murder for a five-pound note."\r\n\r\n"Take back them words, or else I\'ll do for yer; take them back," he said,\r\nraising his fist.\r\n\r\n"Help, help, murder!" Esther screamed. Before the brute could seize her\r\nshe had slipped past, but before she could scream again he had laid hold\r\nof her. Esther thought her last moment had come.\r\n\r\n"Let \'er go, let \'er go," cried Mrs. Spires, clinging on her husband\'s\r\narm. "We don\'t want the perlice in \'ere."\r\n\r\n"Perlice! What do I care about the perlice? Let \'er pay what she owes."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Tom; it is only a trifle. Let her go. Now then, take yer\r\nhook," she said, turning to Esther; "we don\'t want nothing to do with such\r\nas you."\r\n\r\nWith a growl the man loosed his hold, and feeling herself free Esther\r\nrushed through the open doorway. Her feet flew up the wooden steps and she\r\nran out of the street. So shaken were her nerves that the sight of some\r\nmen drinking in a public-house frightened her. She ran on again. There was\r\na cab-stand in the next street, and to avoid the cabmen and the loafers\r\nshe hastily crossed to the other side. Her heart beat violently, her\r\nthoughts were in disorder, and she walked a long while before she realised\r\nthat she did not know where she was going. She stopped to ask the way, and\r\nthen remembered there was no place where she might go.\r\n\r\nShe would have to spend the night in the workhouse, and then?\r\n\r\nShe did not know.... All sorts of thoughts came upon her unsolicited, and\r\nshe walked on and on. At last she rested her burden on the parapet of a\r\nbridge, and saw the London night, blue and gold, vast water rolling, and\r\nthe spectacle of the stars like a dream from which she could not\r\ndisentangle her individuality. Was she to die in the star-lit city, she\r\nand her child; and why should such cruelty happen to her more than to the\r\nnext one? Steadying her thoughts with an effort, she said, "Why not go to\r\nthe workhouse, only for the night?... She did not mind for herself, only\r\nshe did not wish her boy to go there. But if God willed it...."\r\n\r\nShe drew her shawl about her baby and tried once more to persuade herself\r\ninto accepting the shelter of the workhouse. It seemed strange even to her\r\nthat a pale, glassy moon should float high up in the sky, and that she\r\nshould suffer; and then she looked at the lights that fell like golden\r\ndaggers from the Surrey shore into the river. What had she done to deserve\r\nthe workhouse? Above all, what had the poor, innocent child done to\r\ndeserve it? She felt that if she once entered the workhouse she would\r\nremain there. She and her child paupers for ever. "But what can I do?" she\r\nasked herself crazily, and sat down on one of the seats.\r\n\r\nA young man coming home from an evening party looked at her as he passed.\r\nShe asked herself if she should run after him and tell him her story. Why\r\nshould he not assist her? He could so easily spare it. Would he? But\r\nbefore she could decide to appeal to him he had called a passing hansom\r\nand was soon far away. Then looking at the windows of the great hotels,\r\nshe thought of the folk there who could so easily save her from the\r\nworkhouse if they knew. There must be many a kind heart behind those\r\nwindows who would help her if she could only make known her trouble. But\r\nthat was the difficulty. She could not make known her trouble; she could\r\nnot tell the misery she was enduring. She was so ignorant; she could not\r\nmake herself understood. She would be mistaken for a common beggar.\r\nNowhere would she find anyone to listen to her. Was this punishment for\r\nher wrong-doing? An idea of the blind cruelty of fate maddened her, and in\r\nthe delirium of her misery she asked herself if it would not have been\r\nbetter, perhaps, if she had left him with Mrs. Spires. What indeed had the\r\npoor little fellow to live for? A young man in evening dress came towards\r\nher, looking so happy and easy in life, walking with long, swinging\r\nstrides. He stopped and asked her if she was out for a walk.\r\n\r\n"No, sir; I\'m out because I\'ve no place to go."\r\n\r\n"How\'s that?"\r\n\r\nShe told him the story of the baby-farmer and he listened kindly, and she\r\nthought the necessary miracle was about to happen. But he only\r\ncomplimented her on her pluck and got up to go. Then she understood that\r\nhe did not care to listen to sad stories, and a vagrant came and sat down.\r\n\r\n"The \'copper,\'" he said, "will be moving us on presently. It don\'t much\r\nmatter; it\'s too cold to get to sleep, and I think it will rain. My cough\r\nis that bad."\r\n\r\nShe might beg a night\'s lodging of Mrs. Jones. It was far away; she did\r\nnot think she could walk so far. Mrs. Jones might have left, then what\r\nwould she do? The workhouse up there was much the same as the workhouse\r\ndown here. Mrs. Jones couldn\'t keep her for nothing, and there was no use\r\ntrying for another situation as wet-nurse; the hospital would not\r\nrecommend her again.... She must go to the workhouse. Then her thoughts\r\nwandered. She thought of her father, brothers, and sisters, who had gone\r\nto Australia. She wondered if they had yet arrived, if they ever thought\r\nof her, if--She and her baby were on their way to the workhouse. They were\r\ngoing to become paupers. She looked at the vagrant--he had fallen asleep.\r\nHe knew all about the workhouse--should she ask him what it was like? He,\r\ntoo, was friendless. If he had a friend he would not be sleeping on the\r\nEmbankment. Should she ask him? Poor chap, he was asleep. People were\r\nhappy when they were asleep.\r\n\r\nA full moon floated high up in the sky, and the city was no more than a\r\nfaint shadow on the glassy stillness of the night; and she longed to float\r\naway with the moon and the river, to be borne away out of sight of this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHer baby grew heavy in her arms, and the vagrant, a bundle of rags thrown\r\nforward in a heap, slept at the other end of the bench. But she could not\r\nsleep, and the moon whirled on her miserable way. Then the glassy\r\nstillness was broken by the measured tramp of the policeman going his\r\nrounds. He directed her to Lambeth Workhouse, and as she walked towards\r\nWestminster she heard him rousing the vagrant and bidding him move onward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who came to the workhouse for servants never offered more than\r\nfourteen pounds a year, and these wages would not pay for her baby\'s keep\r\nout at nurse. Her friend the matron did all she could, but it was always\r\nfourteen pounds. "We cannot afford more." At last an offer of sixteen\r\npounds a year came from a tradesman in Chelsea; and the matron introduced\r\nEsther to Mrs. Lewis, a lonely widowed woman, who for five shillings a\r\nweek would undertake to look after the child. This would leave Esther\r\nthree pounds a year for dress; three pounds a year for herself.\r\n\r\nWhat luck!\r\n\r\nThe shop was advantageously placed at a street corner. Twelve feet of\r\nfronting on the King\'s Road, and more than half that amount on the side\r\nstreet, exposed to every view wall papers and stained glass designs. The\r\ndwelling-house was over the shop; the shop entrance faced the kerb in the\r\nKing\'s Road.\r\n\r\nThe Bingleys were Dissenters. They were ugly, and exacted the uttermost\r\nfarthing from their customers and their workpeople. Mrs. Bingley was a\r\ntall, gaunt woman, with little grey ringlets on either side of her face.\r\nShe spoke in a sour, resolute voice, when she came down in a wrapper to\r\nsuperintend the cooking. On Sundays she wore a black satin, fastened with\r\na cameo brooch, and round her neck a long gold chain. Then her manners\r\nwere lofty, and when her husband called "Mother," she answered testily,\r\n"Don\'t keep on mothering me." She frequently stopped him to settle his\r\nnecktie or collar. All the week he wore the same short jacket; on Sundays\r\nhe appeared in an ill-fitting frock-coat. His long upper lip was clean\r\nshaven, but under his chin there grew a ring of discoloured hair, neither\r\nbrown nor red, but the neutral tint that hair which does not turn grey\r\nacquires. When he spoke he opened his mouth wide, and seemed quite\r\nunashamed of the empty spaces and the three or four yellow fangs that\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nJohn, the elder of the two brothers, was a silent youth whose one passion\r\nseemed to be eavesdropping. He hung round doors in the hopes of\r\noverhearing his sisters\' conversation and if he heard Esther and the\r\nlittle girl who helped Esther in her work talking in the kitchen, he would\r\nsteal cautiously halfway down the stairs. Esther often thought that his\r\nyoung woman must be sadly in want of a sweetheart to take on with one such\r\nas he. "Come along, Amy," he would cry, passing out before her; and not\r\neven at the end of a long walk did he offer her his arm; and they came\r\nstrolling home just like boy and girl.\r\n\r\nHubert, John\'s younger brother, was quite different. He had escaped the\r\nfamily temperament, as he had escaped the family upper lip. He was the one\r\nspot of colour in a somewhat sombre household, and Esther liked to hear\r\nhim call back to his mother, "All right, mother, I\'ve got the key; no one\r\nneed wait up for me. I\'ll make the door fast."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Hubert, don\'t be later than eleven. You are not going out dancing\r\nagain, are you? Your father will have the electric bell put on the door,\r\nso that he may know when you come in."\r\n\r\nThe four girls were all ruddy-complexioned and long upper-lipped. The\r\neldest was the plainest; she kept her father\'s books, and made the pastry.\r\nThe second and third entertained vague hopes of marriage. The youngest was\r\nsubject to hysterics, fits of some kind.\r\n\r\nThe Bingleys\' own house was representative of their ideas, and the taste\r\nthey had imposed upon the neighbourhood. The staircase was covered with\r\nwhite drugget, and the white enamelled walls had to be kept scrupulously\r\nclean. There were no flowers in the windows, but the springs of the blinds\r\nwere always in perfect order. The drawing-room was furnished with\r\nsubstantial tables, cabinets and chairs, and antimacassars, long and wide,\r\nand china ornaments and glass vases. There was a piano, and on this\r\ninstrument, every Sunday evening, hymns were played by one of the young\r\nladies, and the entire family sang in the chorus.\r\n\r\nIt was into this house that Esther entered as general servant, with wages\r\nfixed at sixteen pounds a year. And for seventeen long hours every day,\r\nfor two hundred and thirty hours every fortnight, she washed, she\r\nscrubbed, she cooked, she ran errands, with never a moment that she might\r\ncall her own. Every second Sunday she was allowed out for four, perhaps\r\nfor four and a half hours; the time fixed was from three to nine, but she\r\nwas expected to be back in time to get the supper ready, and if it were\r\nmany minutes later than nine there were complaints.\r\n\r\nShe had no money. Her quarter\'s wages would not be due for another\r\nfortnight, and as they did not coincide with her Sunday out, she would not\r\nsee her baby for another three weeks. She had not seen him for a month,\r\nand a great longing was in her heart to clasp him in her arms again, to\r\nfeel his soft cheek against hers, to take his chubby legs and warm, fat\r\nfeet in her hands. The four lovely hours of liberty would slip by, she\r\nwould enter on another long fortnight of slavery. But no matter, only to\r\nget them, however quickly they sped from her. She resigned herself to her\r\nfate, her soul rose in revolt, and it grew hourly more difficult for her\r\nto renounce this pleasure. She must pawn her dress--the only decent dress\r\nshe had left. No matter, she must see the child. She would be able to get\r\nthe dress out of pawn when she was paid her wages. Then she would have to\r\nbuy herself a pair of boots; and she owed Mrs. Lewis a good deal of money.\r\nFive shillings a week came to thirteen pound a year, leaving her three\r\npound a year for boots and clothes, journeys back and forward, and\r\neverything the baby might want. Oh, it was not to be done--she never would\r\nbe able to pull through. She dare not pawn her dress; if she did she\'d\r\nnever be able to get it out again. At that moment something bright lying\r\non the floor, under the basin-stand, caught her eye. It was half-a-crown.\r\nShe looked at it, and as the temptation came into her heart to steal, she\r\nraised her eyes and looked round the room.\r\n\r\nShe was in John\'s room--in the sneak\'s room. No one was about. She would\r\nhave cut off one of her fingers for the coin. That half-crown meant\r\npleasure and a happiness so tender and seductive that she closed her eyes\r\nfor a moment. The half-crown she held between forefinger and thumb\r\npresented a ready solution of the besetting difficulty. She threw out the\r\ninsidious temptation, but it came quickly upon her again. If she did not\r\ntake the half-crown she would not be able to go Peckham on Sunday. She\r\ncould replace the money where she found it when she was paid her wages. No\r\none knew it was there; it had evidently rolled there, and having tumbled\r\nbetween the carpet and the wall had not been discovered. It had probably\r\nlain there for months, perhaps it was utterly forgotten. Besides, she need\r\nnot take it now. It would be quite safe if she put it back in its place;\r\non Sunday afternoon she would take it, and if she changed it at once--It\r\nwas not marked. She examined it all over. No, it was not marked. Then the\r\ndesire paused, and she wondered how she, an honest girl, who had never\r\nharboured a dishonest thought in her life before, could desire to steal; a\r\nbitter feeling of shame came upon her.\r\n\r\nIt was a case of flying from temptation, and she left the room so\r\nhurriedly that John, who was spying in the passage, had not time either to\r\nslip downstairs or to hide in his brother\'s room. They met face to face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I beg pardon, sir, but I found this half-crown in your room."\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s nothing wonderful in that. What are you so agitated about?\r\nI suppose you intended to return it to me?"\r\n\r\n"Intended to return it! Of course."\r\n\r\nAn expression of hate and contempt leaped into her handsome grey eyes,\r\nand, like a dog\'s, the red lip turned down. She suddenly understood that\r\nthis pasty-faced, despicable chap had placed the coin where it might have\r\naccidentally rolled, where she would be likely to find it. He had\r\ncomplained that morning that she did not keep his room sufficiently clean!\r\nIt was a carefully-laid plan, he was watching her all the while, and no\r\ndoubt thought that it was his own indiscretion that had prevented her from\r\nfalling into the snare. Without a word Esther dropped the half-crown at\r\nhis feet and returned to her work; and all the time she remained in her\r\npresent situation she persistently refused to speak to him; she brought\r\nhim what he asked for, but never answered him, even with a Yes or No.\r\n\r\nIt was during the few minutes\' rest after dinner that the burden of the\r\nday pressed heaviest upon her; then a painful weariness grew into her\r\nlimbs, and it seemed impossible to summon strength and will to beat\r\ncarpets or sweep down the stairs. But if she were not moving about before\r\nthe clock struck, Mrs. Bingley came down to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Now, Esther, is there nothing for you to do?"\r\n\r\nAnd again, about eight o\'clock, she felt too tired to bear the weight of\r\nher own flesh. She had passed through fourteen hours of almost\r\nunintermittent toil, and it seemed to her that she would never be able to\r\nsummon up sufficient courage to get through the last three hours. It was\r\nthis last summit that taxed all her strength and all her will. Even the\r\nrest that awaited her at eleven o\'clock was blighted by the knowledge of\r\nthe day that was coming; and its cruel hours, long and lean and\r\nhollow-eyed, stared at her through the darkness. She was often too tired\r\nto rest, and rolled over and over in her miserable garret bed, her whole\r\nbody aching. Toil crushed all that was human out of her; even her baby was\r\ngrowing indifferent to her. If it were to die! She did not desire her\r\nbaby\'s death, but she could not forget what the baby-farmer had told\r\nher--the burden would not become lighter, it would become heavier and\r\nheavier. What would become of her? Was there no hope? She buried her face\r\nin her pillow, seeking to escape from the passion of her despair. She was\r\nan unfortunate girl, and had missed all her chances.\r\n\r\nIn the six months she had spent in the house in Chelsea her nature had\r\nbeen strained to the uttermost, and what we call chance now came to decide\r\nthe course of her destiny. The fight between circumstances and character\r\nhad gone till now in favour of character, but circumstances must call up\r\nno further forces against character. A hair would turn the scale either\r\nway. One morning she was startled out of her sleep by a loud knocking at\r\nthe door. It was Mrs. Bingley, who had come to ask her if she knew what\r\ntime it was. It was nearly seven o\'clock. But Mrs. Bingley could not blame\r\nher much, having herself forgotten to put on the electric bell, and Esther\r\nhurried through her dressing. But in hurrying she happened to tread on her\r\ndress, tearing it right across. It was most unfortunate, and just when she\r\nwas most in a hurry. She held up the torn skirt. It was a poor, frayed,\r\nworn-out rag that would hardly bear mending again. Her mistress was\r\ncalling her; there was nothing for it but to run down and tell her what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you got another dress that you can put on?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Really, I can\'t have you going to the door in that thing. You don\'t do\r\ncredit to my house; you must get yourself a new dress at once."\r\n\r\nEsther muttered that she had no money to buy one.\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t know what you do with your money."\r\n\r\n"What I do with my wages is my affair; I\'ve plenty of use for my money."\r\n\r\n"I cannot allow any servant of mine to speak to me like that."\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer, and Mrs. Bingley continued--\r\n\r\n"It is my duty to know what you do with your money, and to see that you do\r\nnot spend it in any wrong way. I am responsible for your moral welfare."\r\n\r\n"Then, ma\'am, I think I had better leave you."\r\n\r\n"Leave me, because I don\'t wish you to spend your money wrongfully,\r\nbecause I know the temptations that a young girl\'s life is beset with?"\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t much chance of temptation for them who work seventeen hours a\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"Esther, you seem to forget--"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am; but there\'s no use talking about what I do with my\r\nmoney--there are other reasons; the place is too hard a one. I\'ve felt it\r\nso for some time, ma\'am. My health ain\'t equal to it."\r\n\r\nOnce she had spoken, Esther showed no disposition to retract, and she\r\nsteadily resisted all Mrs. Bingley\'s solicitations to remain with her. She\r\nknew the risk she was running in leaving her situation, and yet she felt\r\nshe must yield to an instinct like that which impels the hunted animal to\r\nleave the cover and seek safety in the open country. Her whole body cried\r\nout for rest, she must have rest; that was the thing that must be. Mrs.\r\nLewis would keep her and her baby for twelve shillings a week; the present\r\nwas the Christmas quarter, and she was richer by five and twenty shillings\r\nthan she had been before. Mrs. Bingley had given her ten shillings, Mr.\r\nHubert five, and the other ten had been contributed by the four young\r\nladies. Out of this money she hoped to be able to buy a dress and a pair\r\nof boots, as well as a fortnight\'s rest with Mrs. Lewis. She had\r\ndetermined on her plans some three weeks before her month\'s warning would\r\nexpire, and henceforth the mountainous days of her servitude drew out\r\ninterminably, seeming more than ever exhausting, and the longing in her\r\nheart to be free at times rose to her head, and her brain turned as if in\r\ndelirium. Every time she sat down to a meal she remembered she was so many\r\nhours nearer to rest--a fortnight\'s rest--she could not afford more; but\r\nin her present slavery that fortnight seemed at once as a paradise and an\r\neternity. Her only fear was that her health might give way, and that she\r\nwould be laid up during the time she intended for rest--personal rest. Her\r\nbaby was lost sight of. Even a mother demands something in return for her\r\nlove, and in the last year Jackie had taken much and given nothing. But\r\nwhen she opened Mrs. Lewis\'s door he came running to her, calling her\r\nMummie; and the immediate preference he showed for her, climbing on her\r\nknees instead of on Mrs. Lewis\'s, was a fresh sowing of love in the\r\nmother\'s heart.\r\n\r\nThey were in the midst of those few days of sunny weather which come in\r\nJanuary, deluding us so with their brightness and warmth that we look\r\nround for roses and are astonished to see the earth bare of flowers. And\r\nthese bright afternoons Esther spent entirely with Jackie. At the top of\r\nthe hill their way led through a narrow passage between a brick wall and a\r\nhigh paling. She had always to carry him through this passage, for the\r\nground there was sloppy and dirty, and the child wanted to stop to watch\r\nthe pigs through the chinks in the boards. But when they came to the\r\nsmooth, wide, high roads overlooking the valley, she put him down, and he\r\nwould run on ahead, crying, "Turn for a walk, Mummie, turn along," and his\r\nlittle feet went so quickly beneath his frock that it seemed as if he were\r\non wheels. She followed, often forced to break into a run, tremulous lest\r\nhe should fall. They descended the hill into the ornamental park, and\r\nspent happy hours amid geometrically-designed flower-beds and curving\r\nwalks. She ventured with him as far as the old Dulwich village, and they\r\nstrolled through the long street. Behind the street were low-lying,\r\nshiftless fields, intersected with broken hedges. And when Jackie called\r\nto his mother to carry him, she rejoiced in the labour of his weight; and\r\nwhen he grew too heavy, she rested on the farm-gate, and looked into the\r\nvague lowlands. And when the chill of night awoke her from her dream she\r\nclasped Jackie to her bosom and turned towards home, very soon to lose\r\nherself again in another tide of happiness.\r\n\r\nThe evenings, too, were charming. When the candles were lighted, and tea\r\nwas on the table, Esther sat with the dozing child on her knee, looking\r\ninto the flickering fire, her mind a reverie, occasionally broken by the\r\nhomely talk of her companion; and when the baby was laid in his cot she\r\ntook up her sewing--she was making herself a new dress; or else the great\r\nkettle was steaming on the hob, and the women stood over the washing-tubs.\r\nOn the following evening they worked on either side of the ironing-table,\r\nthe candle burning brightly and their vague woman\'s chatter sounding\r\npleasant in the hush of the little cottage. A little after nine they were\r\nin bed, and so the days went softly, like happy, trivial dreams. It was\r\nnot till the end of the third week that Mrs. Lewis would hear of Esther\r\nlooking out for another place. And then Esther was surprised at her good\r\nfortune. A friend of Mrs. Lewis\'s knew a servant who was leaving her\r\nsituation in the West End of London. Esther got the address, and went next\r\nday after the place. She was fortunate enough to obtain it, and her\r\nmistress seemed well satisfied with her. But one day in the beginning of\r\nher second year of service she was told that her mistress wished to speak\r\nto her in the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"I fancy," said the cook, "that it is about that baby of yours; they\'re\r\nvery strict here."\r\n\r\nMrs. Trubner was sitting on a low wicker chair by the fire. She was a\r\nlarge woman with eagle features. Her eyesight had been failing for some\r\nyears, and her maid was reading to her. The maid closed the book and left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"It has come to my knowledge, Waters, that you have a child. You\'re not a\r\nmarried woman, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been unfortunate; I\'ve a child, but that don\'t make no difference so\r\nlong as I gives satisfaction in my work. I don\'t think that the cook has\r\ncomplained, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"No, the cook hasn\'t complained, but had I known this I don\'t think I\r\nshould have engaged you. In the character which you showed me, Mrs.\r\nBarfield said that she believed you to be a thoroughly religious girl at\r\nheart."\r\n\r\n"And I hope I am that, ma\'am. I\'m truly sorry for my fault. I\'ve suffered\r\na great deal."\r\n\r\n"So you all say; but supposing it were to happen again, and in my house?\r\nSupposing----"\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t you think, ma\'am, there is repentance and forgiveness? Our\r\nLord said----"\r\n\r\n"You ought to have told me; and as for Mrs. Barfield, her conduct is most\r\nreprehensible."\r\n\r\n"Then, ma\'am, would you prevent every poor girl who has had a misfortune\r\nfrom earning her bread? If they was all like you there would be more girls\r\nwho\'d do away with themselves and their babies. You don\'t know how hard\r\npressed we are. The baby-farmer says, \'Give me five pounds and I\'ll find a\r\ngood woman who wants a little one, and you shall hear no more about it.\'\r\nThem very words were said to me. I took him away and hoped to be able to\r\nrear him, but if I\'m to lose my situations----"\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry to prevent anyone from earning their bread----"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a mother yourself, ma\'am, and you know what it is."\r\n\r\n"Really, it\'s quite different.... I don\'t know what you mean, Waters."\r\n\r\n"I mean that if I am to lose my situations on account of my baby, I don\'t\r\nknow what will become of me. If I give satisfaction--"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mr. Trubner entered. He was a large, stout man, with his\r\nmother\'s aquiline features. He arrived with his glasses on his nose, and\r\nslightly out of breath.\r\n\r\n"Oh, oh, I didn\'t know, mother," he blurted out, and was about to withdraw\r\nwhen Mrs. Trubner said--\r\n\r\n"This is the new servant whom that lady in Sussex recommended."\r\n\r\nEsther saw a look of instinctive repulsion come over his face.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave you to settle with her, mother."\r\n\r\n"I must speak to you, Harold--I must."\r\n\r\n"I really can\'t; I know nothing of this matter."\r\n\r\nHe tried to leave the room, and when his mother stopped him he said\r\ntestily, "Well, what is it? I am very busy just now, and--" Mrs. Trubner\r\ntold Esther to wait in the passage.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Trubner, "have you discharged her? I leave all these\r\nthings to you."\r\n\r\n"She has told me her story; she is trying to bring up her child on her\r\nwages.... She said if she was kept from earning her bread she didn\'t know\r\nwhat would become of her. Her position is a very terrible one."\r\n\r\n"I know that.... But we can\'t have loose women about the place. They all\r\ncan tell a fine story; the world is full of impostors."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think the girl is an impostor."\r\n\r\n"Very likely not, but everyone has a right to protect themselves."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak so loud, Harold," said Mrs. Trubner, lowering her voice.\r\n"Remember her child is dependent upon her; if we send her away we don\'t\r\nknow what may happen. I\'ll pay her a month\'s wages if you like, but you\r\nmust take the responsibility."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t take any responsibility in the matter. If she had been here two\r\nyears--she has only been here a year--not so much more--and had proved a\r\nsatisfactory servant, I don\'t say that we\'d be justified in sending her\r\naway.... There are plenty of good girls who want a situation as much as\r\nshe. I don\'t see why we should harbour loose women when there are so many\r\ndeserving cases."\r\n\r\n"Then you want me to send her away?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to interfere; you ought to know how to act. Supposing the\r\nsame thing were to happen again? My cousins, young men, coming to the\r\nhouse--"\r\n\r\n"But she won\'t see them."\r\n\r\n"Do as you like; it is your business, not mine. It doesn\'t matter to me,\r\nso long as I\'m not interfered with; keep her if you like. You ought to\r\nhave looked into her character more closely before you engaged her. I\r\nthink that the lady who recommended her ought to be written to very\r\nsharply."\r\n\r\nThey had forgotten to close the door, and Esther stood in the passage\r\nburning and choking with shame.\r\n\r\n"It is a strange thing that religion should make some people so\r\nunfeeling," Esther thought as she left Onslow Square.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to keep her child secret, and in her next situation she\r\nshunned intimacy with her fellow-servants, and was so strict in her\r\nconduct that she exposed herself to their sneers. She dreaded the remark\r\nthat she always went out alone, and often arrived at the cottage\r\nbreathless with fear and expectation--at a cottage where a little boy\r\nstood by a stout middle-aged woman, turning over the pages of the\r\nillustrated papers that his mother had brought him; she had no money to\r\nbuy him toys. Dropping the Illustrated London News, he cried, "Here is\r\nMummie," and ran to her with outstretched arms. Ah, what an embrace! Mrs.\r\nLewis continued her sewing, and for an hour or more Esther told about her\r\nfellow-servants, about the people she lived with, the conversation\r\ninterrupted by the child calling his mother\'s attention to the pictures,\r\nor by the delicate intrusion of his little hand into hers.\r\n\r\nHer clothes were her great difficulty, and she often thought that she\r\nwould rather go back to the slavery of the house in Chelsea than bear the\r\nhumiliation of going out any longer on Sunday in the old things that the\r\nservants had seen her in for eight or nine months or more. She was made to\r\nfeel that she was the lowest of the low--the servant of servants. She had\r\nto accept everybody\'s sneer and everybody\'s bad language, and oftentimes\r\ngross familiarity, in order to avoid arguments and disputes which might\r\nendanger her situation. She had to shut her eyes to the thefts of cooks;\r\nshe had to fetch them drink, and to do their work when they were unable to\r\ndo it themselves. But there was no help for it. She could not pick and\r\nchoose where she would live, and any wages above sixteen pound a year she\r\nmust always accept, and put up with whatever inconvenience she might meet.\r\n\r\nHers is an heroic adventure if one considers it--a mother\'s fight for the\r\nlife of her child against all the forces that civilisation arrays against\r\nthe lowly and the illegitimate. She is in a situation to-day, but on what\r\nsecurity does she hold it? She is strangely dependent on her own health,\r\nand still more upon the fortunes and the personal caprice of her\r\nemployers; and she realised the perils of her life when an outcast mother\r\nat the corner of the street, stretching out of her rags a brown hand and\r\narm, asked alms for the sake of the little children. Esther remembered\r\nthen that three months out of a situation and she too would be on the\r\nstreet as a flower-seller, match-seller, or----\r\n\r\nIt did not seem, however, that any of these fears were to be realised. Her\r\nluck had mended; for nearly two years she had been living with some rich\r\npeople in the West End; she liked her mistress and was on good terms with\r\nher fellow servants, and had it not been for an accident she could have\r\nkept this situation. The young gentlemen had come home for their summer\r\nholidays; she had stepped aside to let Master Harry pass on the stairs.\r\nBut he did not go by, and there was a strange smile on his face.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Esther, I\'m awfully fond of you. You are the prettiest girl\r\nI\'ve ever seen. Come out for a walk with me next Sunday."\r\n\r\n"Master Harry, I\'m surprised at you; will you let me go by at once?"\r\n\r\nThere was no one near, the house was silent, and the boy stood on the step\r\nabove her. He tried to throw his arm round her waist, but she shook him\r\noff and went up to her room calm with indignation. A few days afterward\r\nshe suddenly became aware that he was following her in the street. She\r\nturned sharply upon him.\r\n\r\n"Master Harry, I know that this is only a little foolishness on your part,\r\nbut if you don\'t leave off I shall lose my situation, and I\'m sure you\r\ndon\'t want to do me an injury."\r\n\r\nMaster Harry seemed sorry, and he promised not to follow her in the street\r\nagain. And never thinking that it was he who had written the letter she\r\nreceived a few days after, she asked Annie, the upper housemaid, to read\r\nit. It contained reference to meetings and unalterable affection, and it\r\nconcluded with a promise to marry her if she lost her situation through\r\nhis fault. Esther listened like one stunned. A schoolboy\'s folly, the\r\nfirst silly sentimentality of a boy, a thing lighter than the lightest\r\nleaf that falls, had brought disaster upon her.\r\n\r\nIf Annie had not seen the letter she might have been able to get the boy\r\nto listen to reason; but Annie had seen the letter, and Annie could not be\r\ntrusted. The story would be sure to come out, and then she would lose her\r\ncharacter as well as her situation. It was a great pity. Her mistress had\r\npromised to have her taught cooking at South Kensington, and a cook\'s\r\nwages would secure her and her child against all ordinary accidents. She\r\nwould never get such a chance again, and would remain a kitchen-maid to\r\nthe end of her days. And acting on the impulse of the moment she went\r\nstraight to the drawing-room. Her mistress was alone, and Esther handed\r\nher the letter. "I thought you had better see this at once, ma\'am. I did\r\nnot want you to think it was my fault. Of course the young gentleman means\r\nno harm."\r\n\r\n"Has anyone seen this letter?"\r\n\r\n"I showed it to Annie. I\'m no scholar myself, and the writing was\r\ndifficult."\r\n\r\n"You have no reason for supposing----How often did Master Harry speak to\r\nyou in this way?"\r\n\r\n"Only twice, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is only a little foolishness. I needn\'t say that he doesn\'t\r\nmean what he says."\r\n\r\n"I told him, ma\'am, that if he continued I should lose my situation."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to part with you, Esther, but I really think that the best way\r\nwill be for you to leave. I am much obliged to you for showing me this\r\nletter. Master Harry, you see, says that he is going away to the country\r\nfor a week. He left this morning. So I really think that a month\'s wages\r\nwill settle matters nicely. You are an excellent servant, and I shall be\r\nglad to recommend you."\r\n\r\nThen Esther heard her mistress mutter something about the danger of\r\ngood-looking servants. And Esther was paid a month\'s wages, and left that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of August, and London yawned in every street; the\r\ndust blew unslaked, and a little cloud curled and disappeared over the\r\ncrest of the hill at Hyde Park Corner; the streets and St. George\'s Place\r\nlooked out with blind, white eyes; and in the deserted Park the trees\r\ntossed their foliage restlessly, as if they wearied and missed the fashion\r\nof their season. And all through Park Lane and Mayfair, caretakers and\r\ngaunt cats were the traces that the caste on which Esther depended had\r\nleft of its departed presence. She was coming from the Alexandra Hotel,\r\nwhere she had heard a kitchen-maid was wanted. Mrs. Lewis had urged her to\r\nwait until people began to come back to town. Good situations were rarely\r\nobtainable in the summer months; it would be bad policy to take a bad one,\r\neven if it were only for a while. Besides, she had saved a little money,\r\nand, feeling that she required a rest, had determined to take this advice.\r\nBut as luck would have it Jackie fell ill before she had been at Dulwich a\r\nweek. His illness made a big hole in her savings, and it had become\r\nevident that she would have to set to work and at once.\r\n\r\nShe turned into the park. She was going north, to a registry office near\r\nOxford Street, which Mrs. Lewis had recommended. Holborn Row was difficult\r\nto find, and she had to ask the way very often, but she suddenly knew that\r\nshe was in the right street by the number of servant-girls going and\r\ncoming from the office, and in company with five others Esther ascended a\r\ngloomy little staircase. The office was on the first floor. The doors were\r\nopen, and they passed into a special odour of poverty, as it were, into an\r\natmosphere of mean interests.\r\n\r\nBenches covered with red plush were on either side, and these were\r\noccupied by fifteen or twenty poorly-dressed women. A little old woman,\r\nvery white and pale, stood near the window recounting her misfortunes to\r\nno one in particular.\r\n\r\n"I lived with her more than thirty years; I brought up all the children. I\r\nentered her service as nurse, and when the children grew up I was given\r\nthe management of everything. For the last fifteen years my mistress was a\r\nconfirmed invalid. She entrusted everything to me. Oftentimes she took my\r\nhand and said, \'You are a good creature, Holmes, you mustn\'t think of\r\nleaving me; how should I get on without you?\' But when she died they had\r\nto part with me; they said they were very sorry, and wouldn\'t have thought\r\nof doing so, only they were afraid I was getting too old for the work. I\r\ndaresay I was wrong to stop so long in one situation. I shouldn\'t have\r\ndone so, but she always used to say, \'You mustn\'t leave us; we never shall\r\nbe able to get on without you.\'"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the secretary, an alert young woman with a decisive voice,\r\ncame through the folding doors.\r\n\r\n"I will not have all this talking," she said. Her quick eyes fell on the\r\nlittle old woman, and she came forward a few steps. "What, you here again,\r\nMiss Holmes? I\'ve told you that when I hear of anything that will suit you\r\nI\'ll write."\r\n\r\n"So you said, Miss, but my little savings are running short. I\'m being\r\npressed for my rent."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help that; when I hear of anything I\'ll write. But I can\'t have\r\nyou coming here every third day wasting my time; now run along." And\r\nhaving made casual remarks about the absurdity of people of that age\r\ncoming after situations, she called three or four women to her desk, of\r\nwhom Esther was one. She examined them critically, and seemed especially\r\nsatisfied with Esther\'s appearance.\r\n\r\n"It will be difficult," she said, "to find you the situation you want\r\nbefore people begin to return to town. If you were only an inch or two\r\ntaller I could get you a dozen places as housemaid; tall servants are all\r\nthe fashion, and you are the right age--about five-and-twenty."\r\n\r\nEsther left a dozen stamps with her, and soon after she began to receive\r\nletters containing the addresses of ladies who required servants. They\r\nwere of all sorts, for the secretary seemed to exercise hardly any\r\ndiscrimination, and Esther was sent on long journeys from Brixton to\r\nNotting Hill to visit poor people who could hardly afford a\r\nmaid-of-all-work. These useless journeys were very fatiguing. Sometimes\r\nshe was asked to call at a house in Bayswater, and thence she had to go to\r\nHigh Street, Kensington, or Earl\'s Court; a third address might be in\r\nChelsea. She could only guess which was the best chance, and while she was\r\nhesitating the situation might be given away. Very often the ladies were\r\nout, and she was asked to call later in the day. These casual hours she\r\nspent in the parks, mending Jackie\'s socks or hemming pocket\r\nhandkerchiefs, so she was frequently delayed till evening; and in the\r\nmildness of the summer twilight, with some fresh disappointment lying\r\nheavy on her heart, she made her way from the Marble Arch round the barren\r\nSerpentine into Piccadilly, with its stream of light beginning in the\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nAnd standing at the kerb of Piccadilly Circus, waiting for a \'bus to take\r\nher to Ludgate Hill Station, the girl grew conscious of the moving\r\nmultitude that filled the streets. The great restaurants rose up calm and\r\nviolet in the evening sky, the Cafe Monico, with its air of French\r\nnewspapers and Italian wines; and before the grey facade of the\r\nfashionable Criterion hansoms stopped and dinner parties walked across the\r\npavement. The fine weather had brought the women up earlier than usual\r\nfrom the suburbs. They came up the long road from Fulham, with white\r\ndresses floating from their hips, and feather boas waving a few inches\r\nfrom the pavement. But through this elegant disguise Esther could pick out\r\nthe servant-girls. Their stories were her story. They had been deserted,\r\nas she had been; and perhaps each had a child to support, only they had\r\nnot been so lucky as she had been in finding situations.\r\n\r\nBut now luck seemed to have deserted her. It was the middle of September\r\nand she had not yet been able to find the situation she wanted; and it had\r\nbecome more and more distressing to her to refuse sixteen pound a year.\r\nShe had calculated it all out, and nothing less than eighteen pound was of\r\nany use to her. With eighteen pound and a kind mistress who would give her\r\nan old dress occasionally she could do very well. But if she didn\'t find\r\nthese two pounds she did not know what she should do. She might drag on\r\nfor a time on sixteen pound, but such wages would drive her in the end\r\ninto the workhouse. If it were not for the child! But she would never\r\ndesert her darling boy, who loved her so dearly, come what might. A sudden\r\nimagination let her see him playing in the little street, waiting for her\r\nto come home, and her love for him went to her head like madness. She\r\nwondered at herself; it seemed almost unnatural to love anything as she\r\ndid this child.\r\n\r\nThen, in a shiver of fear, determined to save her \'bus fare, she made her\r\nway through Leicester Square. She was a good-looking girl, who hastened\r\nher steps when addressed by a passer-by or crossed the roadway in sullen\r\nindignation, and who looked in contempt on the silks and satins which\r\nturned into the Empire, and she seemed to lose heart utterly. She had been\r\nwalking all day and had not tasted food since the morning, and the\r\nweakness of the flesh brought a sudden weakness of the spirit. She felt\r\nthat she could struggle no more, that the whole world was against her--she\r\nfelt that she must have food and drink and rest. All this London tempted\r\nher, and the cup was at her lips. A young man in evening clothes had\r\nspoken to her. His voice was soft, the look in his eyes seemed kindly.\r\n\r\nThinking of the circumstances ten minutes later it seemed to her that she\r\nhad intended to answer him. But she was now at Charing Cross. There was a\r\nlightness, an emptiness in her head which she could not overcome, and the\r\ncrowd appeared to her like a blurred, noisy dream. And then the dizziness\r\nleft her, and she realised the temptation she had escaped. Here, as in\r\nPiccadilly, she could pick out the servant girls; but here their service\r\nwas yesterday\'s lodging-house--poor and dissipated girls, dressed in vague\r\nclothes fixed with hazardous pins. Two young women strolled in front of\r\nher. They hung on each other\'s arms, talking lazily. They had just come\r\nout of an eating-house, and a happy digestion was in their eyes. The skirt\r\non the outside was a soiled mauve, and the bodice that went with it was a\r\nsoiled chocolate. A broken yellow plume hung out of a battered hat. The\r\nskirt on the inside was a dim green, and little was left of the cotton\r\nvelvet jacket but the cotton. A girl of sixteen walking sturdily, like a\r\nlittle man, crossed the road, her left hand thrust deep into the pocket of\r\nher red cashmere dress. She wore on her shoulders a strip of beaded\r\nmantle; her hair was plaited and tied with a red ribbon. Corpulent women\r\npassed, their eyes liquid with invitation; and the huge bar-loafer, the\r\nman of fifty, the hooked nose and the waxed moustache, stood at the door\r\nof a restaurant, passing the women in review.\r\n\r\nA true London of the water\'s edge--a London of theatres, music-halls,\r\nwine-shops, public-houses--the walls painted various colours, nailed over\r\nwith huge gold lettering; the pale air woven with delicate wire, a\r\ngossamer web underneath which the crowd moved like lazy flies, one half\r\nwatching the perforated spire of St. Mary\'s, and all the City spires\r\nbehind it now growing cold in the east, the other half seeing the spire of\r\nSt. Martin\'s above the chimney-pots aloft in a sky of cream pink. Stalwart\r\npolicemen urged along groups of slattern boys and girls; and after vulgar\r\nremonstrance these took the hint and disappeared down strange passages.\r\nSuddenly Esther came face to face with a woman whom she recognised as\r\nMargaret Gale.\r\n\r\n"What, is it you, Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is me all right. What are you doing up here? Got tired of\r\nservice? Come and have a drink, old gal."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you; I\'m glad to have seen you, Margaret, but I\'ve a train to\r\ncatch."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t do," said Margaret, catching her by the arm; "we must have a\r\ndrink and a talk over old times."\r\n\r\nEsther felt that if she did not have something she would faint before she\r\nreached Ludgate Hill, and Margaret led the way through the public-house,\r\nopening all the varnished doors, seeking a quiet corner. "What\'s the\r\nmatter?" she said, startled at the pallor of Esther\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Only a little faintness; I\'ve not had anything to eat all day."\r\n\r\n"Quick, quick, four of brandy and some water," Margaret cried to the\r\nbarman, and a moment after she was holding the glass to her friend\'s lips.\r\n"Not had anything to eat all day, dear? Then we\'ll have a bite and a sup\r\ntogether. I feel a bit peckish myself. Two sausages and two rolls and\r\nbutter," she cried. Then the women had a long talk. Margaret told Esther\r\nthe story of her misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe Barfields were all broken up. They had been very unlucky racing, and\r\nwhen the servants got the sack Margaret had come up to London. She had\r\nbeen in several situations. Eventually, one of her masters had got her\r\ninto trouble, his wife had turned her out neck and crop, and what was she\r\nto do? Then Esther told how Master Harry had lost her her situation.\r\n\r\n"And you left like that? Well I never! The better one behaves the worse\r\none gets treated, and them that goes on with service find themselves in\r\nthe end without as much as will buy them a Sunday dinner."\r\n\r\nMargaret insisted on accompanying Esther, and they walked together as far\r\nas Wellington Street. "I can\'t go any further," and pointing to where\r\nLondon seemed to end in a piece of desolate sky, she said, "I live on the\r\nother side, in Stamford Street. You might come and see me. If you ever get\r\ntired of service you\'ll get decent rooms there."\r\n\r\nBad weather followed fine, and under a streaming umbrella Esther went from\r\none address to another, her damp skirts clinging about her and her boots\r\nclogged with mud. She looked upon the change in the weather as\r\nunfortunate, for in getting a situation so much depended on personal\r\nappearance and cheerfulness of manner; and it is difficult to seem a right\r\nand tidy girl after two miles\' walk through the rain.\r\n\r\nOne lady told Esther that she liked tall servants, another said she never\r\nengaged good-looking girls, and another place that would have suited her\r\nwas lost through unconsciously answering that she was chapel. The lady\r\nwould have nothing in her house but church. Then there were the\r\ndisappointments occasioned by the letters which she received from people\r\nwho she thought would have engaged her, saying they were sorry, but that\r\nthey had seen some one whom they liked better.\r\n\r\nAnother week passed and Esther had to pawn her clothes to get money for\r\nher train fare to London, and to keep the registry office supplied with\r\nstamps. Her prospects had begun to seem quite hopeless, and she lay awake\r\nthinking that she and Jackie must go back to the workhouse. They could not\r\nstop on at Mrs. Lewis\'s much longer. Mrs. Lewis had been very good to\r\nthem, but Esther owed her two weeks\' money. What was to be done? She had\r\nheard of charitable institutions, but she was an ignorant girl and did not\r\nknow how to make the necessary inquiries. Oh, the want of a little\r\nmoney--of a very little money; the thought beat into her brain. For just\r\nenough to hold on till the people came back to town.\r\n\r\nOne day Mrs. Lewis, who read the newspapers for her, came to her with an\r\nadvertisement which she said seemed to read like a very likely chance.\r\nEsther looked at the pence which remained out of the last dress that she\r\nhad pawned.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid," she said, "it will turn out like the others; I\'m out of my\r\nluck."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that," said Mrs. Lewis; "keep your courage up; I\'ll stick to\r\nyou as long as I can."\r\n\r\nThe women had a good cry in each other\'s arms, and then Mrs. Lewis advised\r\nEsther to take the situation, even if it were no more than sixteen. "A lot\r\ncan be done by constant saving, and if she gives yer \'er dresses and ten\r\nshillings for a Christmas-box, I don\'t see why you should not pull\r\nthrough. The baby shan\'t cost you more than five shillings a week till you\r\nget a situation as plain cook. Here is the address--Miss Rice, Avondale\r\nRoad, West Kensington."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nAvondale Road was an obscure corner of the suburb--obscure, for it had\r\njust sprung into existence. The scaffolding that had built it now littered\r\nan adjoining field, where in a few months it would rise about Horsely\r\nGardens, whose red gables and tiled upper walls will correspond\r\nunfailingly with those of Avondale Road. Nowhere in this neighbourhood\r\ncould Esther detect signs of eighteen pounds a year. Scanning the Venetian\r\nblinds of the single drawing-room window, she said to herself, "Hot joint\r\ntoday, cold the next." She noted the trim iron railings and the spare\r\nshrubs, and raising her eyes she saw the tiny gable windows of the\r\ncupboard-like rooms where the single servant kept in these houses slept.\r\n\r\nA few steps more brought her to 41, the corner house. The thin passage and\r\nthe meagre staircase confirmed Esther in the impression she had received\r\nfrom the aspect of the street; and she felt that the place was more\r\nsuitable to the gaunt woman with iron-grey hair who waited in the passage.\r\nThis woman looked apprehensively at Esther, and when Esther said that she\r\nhad come after the place a painful change of expression passed over her\r\nface, and she said--\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get it; I\'m too old for anything but charing. How much are you\r\ngoing to ask?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t take less than sixteen."\r\n\r\n"Sixteen! I used to get that once; I\'d be glad enough to get twelve now.\r\nYou can\'t think of sixteen once you\'ve turned forty, and I\'ve lost my\r\nteeth, and they means a couple of pound off."\r\n\r\nThen the door opened, and a woman\'s voice called to the gaunt woman to\r\ncome in. She went in, and Esther breathed a prayer that she might not be\r\nengaged. A minute intervened, and the gaunt woman came out; there were\r\ntears in her eyes, and she whispered to Esther as she passed, "No good; I\r\ntold you so. I\'m too old for anything but charing." The abruptness of the\r\ninterview suggested a hard mistress, and Esther was surprised to find\r\nherself in the presence of a slim lady, about seven-and-thirty, whose\r\nsmall grey eyes seemed to express a kind and gentle nature. As she stood\r\nspeaking to her, Esther saw a tall glass filled with chrysanthemums and a\r\nlarge writing-table covered with books and papers. There was a bookcase,\r\nand in place of the usual folding-doors, a bead curtain hung between the\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nThe room almost said that the occupant was a spinster and a writer, and\r\nEsther remembered that she had noticed even at the time Miss Rice\'s\r\nmanuscript, it was such a beautiful clear round hand, and it lay on the\r\ntable, ready to be continued the moment she should have settled with her.\r\n\r\n"I saw your advertisement in the paper, miss; I\'ve come after the\r\nsituation."\r\n\r\n"You are used to service?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, I\'ve had several situations in gentlemen\'s families, and have\r\nexcellent characters from them all." Then Esther related the story of her\r\nsituations, and Miss Rice put up her glasses and her grey eyes smiled. She\r\nseemed pleased with the somewhat rugged but pleasant-featured girl before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"I live alone," she said; "the place is an easy one, and if the wages\r\nsatisfy you, I think you will suit me very well. My servant, who has been\r\nwith me some years, is leaving me to be married."\r\n\r\n"What are the wages, miss?"\r\n\r\n"Fourteen pounds a year."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, miss, there would be no use my taking the place; I\'ve so many\r\ncalls on my money that I could not manage on fourteen pounds. I\'m very\r\nsorry, for I feel sure I should like to live with you, miss."\r\n\r\nBut what was the good of taking the place? She could not possibly manage\r\non fourteen, even if Miss Rice did give her a dress occasionally, and that\r\ndidn\'t look likely. All her strength seemed to give way under her\r\nmisfortune, and it was with difficulty that she restrained her tears.\r\n\r\n"I think we should suit each other," Miss Rice said reflectively.\r\n\r\n"I should like to have you for my servant if I could afford it. How much\r\nwould you take?"\r\n\r\n"Situated, as I am, miss, I could not take less than sixteen. I\'ve been\r\nused to eighteen."\r\n\r\n"Sixteen pounds is more than I can afford, but I\'ll think it over. Give me\r\nyour name and address."\r\n\r\n"Esther Waters, 13 Poplar Road, Dulwich."\r\n\r\nAs Esther turned to go she became aware of the kindness of the eyes that\r\nlooked at her. Miss Rice said--\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'re in trouble.... Sit down; tell me about it."\r\n\r\n"No, miss, what\'s the use?" But Miss Rice looked at her so kindly that\r\nEsther could not restrain herself. "There\'s nothing for it," she said,\r\n"but to go back to the workhouse."\r\n\r\n"But why should you go to the workhouse? I offer you fourteen pounds a\r\nyear and everything found."\r\n\r\n"You see, miss, I\'ve a baby; we\'ve been in the workhouse already; I had to\r\ngo there the night I left my situation, to get him away from Mrs. Spires;\r\nshe wanted to kill him; she\'d have done it for five pounds--that\'s the\r\nprice. But, miss, my story is not one that can be told to a lady such as\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I think I\'m old enough to listen to your story; sit down, and tell it to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nAnd all the while Miss Rice\'s eyes were filled with tenderness and pity.\r\n\r\n"A very sad story--just such a story as happens every day. But you have\r\nbeen punished, you have indeed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, I think I have; and after all these years of striving it is\r\nhard to have to take him back to the workhouse. Not that I want to give\r\nout that I was badly treated there, but it is the child I\'m thinking of.\r\nHe was then a little baby and it didn\'t matter; we was only there a few\r\nmonths. There\'s no one that knows of it but me. But he\'s a growing boy\r\nnow, he\'ll remember the workhouse, and it will be always a disgrace."\r\n\r\n"How old is he?"\r\n\r\n"He was six last May, miss. It has been a hard job to bring him up. I now\r\npay six shillings a week for him, that\'s more than fourteen pounds a year,\r\nand you can\'t do much in the way of clothes on two pounds a year. And now\r\nthat he\'s growing up he\'s costing more than ever; but Mrs. Lewis--that\'s\r\nthe woman what has brought him up--is as fond of him as I am myself. She\r\ndon\'t want to make nothing out of his keep, and that\'s how I\'ve managed up\r\nto the present. But I see well enough that it can\'t be done; his expense\r\nincreases, and the wages remains the same. It was my pride to bring him up\r\non my earnings, and my hope to see him an honest man earning good money.\r\nBut it wasn\'t to be, miss, it wasn\'t to be. We must be humble and go back\r\nto the workhouse."\r\n\r\n"I can see that it has been a hard fight."\r\n\r\n"It has indeed, miss; no one will ever know how hard. I shouldn\'t mind if\r\nit wasn\'t going to end by going back to where it started.... They\'ll take\r\nhim from me; I shall never see him while he is there. I wish I was dead,\r\nmiss, I can\'t bear my trouble no longer."\r\n\r\n"You shan\'t go back to the workhouse so long as I can help you. Esther,\r\nI\'ll give you the wages you ask for. It is more than I can afford.\r\nEighteen pounds a year! But your child shall not be taken from you. You\r\nshall not go to the workhouse. There aren\'t many such good women in the\r\nworld as you, Esther."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the first Miss Rice was interested in her servant, and encouraged her\r\nconfidences. But it was some time before either was able to put aside her\r\nnatural reserve. They were not unlike--quiet, instinctive Englishwomen,\r\nstrong, warm natures, under an appearance of formality and reserve.\r\n\r\nThe instincts of the watch-dog soon began to develop in Esther, and she\r\nextended her supervision over all the household expenses, likewise over\r\nher mistress\'s health.\r\n\r\n"Now, miss, I must \'ave you take your soup while it is \'ot. You\'d better\r\nput away your writing; you\'ve been at it all the morning. You\'ll make\r\nyourself ill, and then I shall have the nursing of you." If Miss Rice were\r\ngoing out in the evening she would find herself stopped in the passage.\r\n"Now, miss, I really can\'t see you go out like that; you\'ll catch your\r\ndeath of cold. You must put on your warm cloak."\r\n\r\nMiss Rice\'s friends were principally middle-aged ladies. Her sisters,\r\nlarge, stout women, used to come and see her, and there was a\r\nfashionably-dressed young man whom her mistress seemed to like very much.\r\nMr. Alden was his name, and Miss Rice told Esther that he, too, wrote\r\nnovels; they used to talk about each other\'s books for hours, and Esther\r\nfeared that Miss Rice was giving her heart away to one who did not care\r\nfor her. But perhaps she was satisfied to see Mr. Alden once a week and\r\ntalk for an hour with him about books. Esther didn\'t think she\'d care, if\r\nshe had a young man, to see him come and go like a shadow. But she hadn\'t\r\na young man, and did not want one. All she now wanted was to awake in the\r\nmorning and know that her child was safe; her ambition was to make her\r\nmistress\'s life comfortable. And for more than a year she pursued her plan\r\nof life unswervingly. She declined an offer of marriage, and was rarely\r\npersuaded into a promise to walk out with any of her admirers. One of\r\nthese was a stationer\'s foreman, and almost every day Esther went to the\r\nstationer\'s for the sermon paper on which her mistress wrote her novels,\r\nfor blotting-paper, for stamps, to post letters--that shop seemed the\r\ncentre of their lives.\r\n\r\nFred Parsons--that was his name--was a meagre little man about\r\nthirty-five. A high and prominent forehead rose above a small pointed\r\nface, and a scanty growth of blonde beard and moustache did not conceal\r\nthe receding chin nor the red sealing-wax lips. His faded yellow hair was\r\nbeginning to grow thin, and his threadbare frock-coat hung limp from\r\nsloping shoulders. But these disadvantages were compensated by a clear\r\nbell-like voice, into which no trace of doubt ever seemed to come; and his\r\nmind was neatly packed with a few religious and political ideas. He had\r\nbeen in business in the West End, but an uncontrollable desire to ask\r\nevery customer who entered into conversation with him if he were sure that\r\nhe believed in the second coming of Christ had been the cause of severance\r\nbetween him and his employers.\r\n\r\nHe had been at West Kensington a fortnight, had served Esther once with\r\nsermon paper, and had already begun to wonder what were her religious\r\nbeliefs. But bearing in mind his recent dismissal, he refrained for the\r\npresent. At the end of the week they were alone in the shop. Esther had\r\ncome for a packet of note-paper. Fred was sorry she had not come for\r\nsermon paper; if she had it would have been easier to inquire her opinions\r\nregarding the second coming. But the opportunity, such as it was, was not\r\nto be resisted. He said--\r\n\r\n"Your mistress seems to use a great deal of paper; it was only a day or\r\ntwo ago that I served you with four quires."\r\n\r\n"That was for her books; what she now wants is note-paper."\r\n\r\n"So your mistress writes books!"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I hope they\'re good books--books that are helpful." He paused to see that\r\nno one was within earshot. "Books that bring sinners back to the Lord."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what she writes; I only know she writes books; I think I\'ve\r\nheard she writes novels."\r\n\r\nFred did not approve of novels--Esther could see that--and she was sorry;\r\nfor he seemed a nice, clear-spoken young man, and she would have liked to\r\ntell him that her mistress was the last person who would write anything\r\nthat could do harm to anyone. But her mistress was waiting for her paper,\r\nand she took leave of him hastily. The next time they met was in the\r\nevening. She was going to see if she could get some fresh eggs for her\r\nmistress\'s breakfast before the shops closed, and coming towards her,\r\nwalking at a great pace, she saw one whom she thought she recognised, a\r\nmeagre little man with long reddish hair curling under the brim of a large\r\nsoft black hat. He nodded, smiling pleasantly as he passed her.\r\n\r\n"Lor\'," she thought, "I didn\'t know him; it\'s the stationer\'s foreman."\r\nAnd the very next evening they met in the same street; she was out for a\r\nlittle walk, he was hurrying to catch his train. They stopped to pass the\r\ntime of day, and three days after they met at the same time, and as nearly\r\nas possible at the same place.\r\n\r\n"We\'re always meeting," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, isn\'t it strange?... You come this way from business?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes; about eight o\'clock is my time."\r\n\r\nIt was the end of August; the stars caught fire slowly in the murky London\r\nsunset; and, vaguely conscious of a feeling of surprise at the pleasure\r\nthey took in each other\'s company, they wandered round a little bleak\r\nsquare in which a few shrubs had just been planted. They took up the\r\nconversation exactly at the point where it had been broken off.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," Fred said, "that the paper isn\'t going to be put to better\r\nuse."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know my mistress, or you wouldn\'t say that."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you don\'t know that novels are very often stories about the loves\r\nof men for other men\'s wives. Such books can serve no good purpose."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure my mistress don\'t write about such things. How could she, poor\r\ndear innocent lamb? It is easy to see you don\'t know her."\r\n\r\nIn the course of their argument it transpired that Miss Rice went to\r\nneither church nor chapel.\r\n\r\nFred was much shocked.\r\n\r\n"I hope," he said, "you do not follow your mistress\'s example."\r\n\r\nEsther admitted she had for some time past neglected her religion. Fred\r\nwent so far as to suggest that she ought to leave her present situation\r\nand enter a truly religious family.\r\n\r\n"I owe her too much ever to think of leaving her. And it has nothing to do\r\nwith her if I haven\'t thought as much about the Lord as I ought to have.\r\nIt\'s the first place I\'ve been in where there was time for religion."\r\n\r\nThis answer seemed to satisfy Fred.\r\n\r\n"Where used you to go?"\r\n\r\n"My people--father and mother--belonged to the Brethren."\r\n\r\n"To the Close or the Open?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember; I was only a little child at the time."\r\n\r\n"I\'m a Plymouth Brother."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is strange."\r\n\r\n"Remember that it is only through belief in our Lord, in the sacrifice of\r\nthe Cross, that we can be saved."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe that."\r\n\r\nThe avowal seemed to have brought them strangely near to each other, and\r\non the following Sunday Fred took Esther to meeting, and introduced her as\r\none who had strayed, but who had never ceased to be one of them.\r\n\r\nShe had not been to meeting since she was a little child; and the bare\r\nroom and bare dogma, in such immediate accordance with her own\r\nnature--were they not associated with memories of home, of father and\r\nmother, of all that had gone?--touched her with a human delight that\r\nseemed to reach to the roots of her nature. It was Fred who preached; and\r\nhe spoke of the second coming of Christ, when the faithful would be\r\ncarried away in clouds of glory, of the rapine and carnage to which the\r\nworld would be delivered up before final absorption in everlasting hell;\r\nand a sensation of dreadful awe passed over the listening faces; a young\r\ngirl who sat with closed eyes put out her hand to assure herself that\r\nEsther was still there--that she had not been carried away in glory.\r\n\r\nAs they walked home, Esther told Fred that she had not been so happy for a\r\nlong time. He pressed her hand, and thanked her with a look in which\r\nappeared all his soul; she was his for ever and ever; nothing could wholly\r\ndisassociate them; he had saved her soul. His exaltation moved her to\r\nwonder. But her own innate faith, though incapable of these exaltations,\r\nhad supported her during many a troublous year. Fred would want her to\r\ncome to meeting with him next Sunday, and she was going to Dulwich. Sooner\r\nor later he would find out that she had a child, then she would see him no\r\nmore. It were better that she should tell him than that he should hear it\r\nfrom others. But she felt she could not bear the humiliation, the shame;\r\nand she wished they had never met. That child came between her and every\r\npossible happiness.... It were better to break off with Fred. But what\r\nexcuse could she give? Everything went wrong with her. He might ask her to\r\nmarry him, then she would have to tell him.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the week she heard some one tap at the window; it was\r\nFred. He asked her why he had not seen her; she answered that she had not\r\nhad time.\r\n\r\n"Can you come out this evening?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you like."\r\n\r\nShe put on her hat, and they went out. Neither spoke, but their feet took\r\ninstinctively the pavement that led to the little square where they had\r\nwalked the first time they went out together.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been thinking of you a good deal, Esther, in the last few days. I\r\nwant to ask you to marry me."\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Will you?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t; I\'m very sorry; don\'t ask me."\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"If I told you I don\'t think you\'d want to marry me. I suppose I\'d better\r\ntell you. I\'m not the good woman you think me. I\'ve got a child. There,\r\nyou have it now, and you can take your hook when you like."\r\n\r\nIt was her blunt, sullen nature that had spoken; she didn\'t care if he\r\nleft her on the spot--now he knew all and could do as he liked. At last,\r\nhe said--\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve repented, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"I should think I had, and been punished too, enough for a dozen\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then it wasn\'t lately?"\r\n\r\n"Lately! It\'s nearly eight year ago."\r\n\r\n"And all that time you\'ve been a good woman?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think I\'ve been that."\r\n\r\n"Then if--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want no ifs. If I am not good enough for you, you can go\r\nelsewhere and get better; I\'ve had enough of reproaches."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to reproach you; I know that a woman\'s path is more\r\ndifficult to walk in than ours. It may not be a woman\'s fault if she\r\nfalls, but it is always a man\'s. He can always fly from temptation."\r\n\r\n"Yet there isn\'t a man that can say he hasn\'t gone wrong."\r\n\r\n"No, not all, Esther."\r\n\r\nEsther looked him full in the face.\r\n\r\n"I understand what you mean, Esther, but I can honestly say that I never\r\nhave."\r\n\r\nEsther did not like him any better for his purity, and was irritated by\r\nthe clear tones of his icy voice.\r\n\r\n"But that is no reason why I should be hard on those who have not been so\r\nfortunate. I didn\'t mean to reproach you just now, Esther; I only meant to\r\nsay that I wish you had told me this before I took you to meeting."\r\n\r\n"So you\'re ashamed of me, is that it? Well, you can keep your shame to\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"No, not that, Esther--"\r\n\r\n"Then you\'d like to see me humiliated before the others, as if I haven\'t\r\nhad enough of that already."\r\n\r\n"No, Esther, listen to me. Those who transgress the moral law may not\r\nkneel at the table for a time, until they have repented; but those who\r\nbelieve in the sacrifice of the Cross are acquitted, and I believe you do\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"A sinner that repenteth----I will speak about this at our next meeting;\r\nyou will come with me there?"\r\n\r\n"Next Sunday I\'m going to Dulwich to see the child."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you go after meeting?"\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t be out morning and afternoon both."\r\n\r\n"May I go with you?"\r\n\r\n"To Dulwich!"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t go until after meeting; I can meet you at the railway station."\r\n\r\n"If you like."\r\n\r\nAs they walked home Esther told Fred the story of her betrayal. He was\r\ninterested in the story, and was very sorry for her.\r\n\r\n"I love you, Esther; it is easy to forgive those we love."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very good; I never thought to find a man so good." She looked up\r\nin his face; her hand was on the gate, and in that moment she felt that\r\nshe almost loved him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Humphries, an elderly person, who looked after a bachelor\'s\r\nestablishment two doors up, and generally slipped in about tea-time, soon\r\nbegan to speak of Fred as a very nice young man who would be likely to\r\nmake a woman happy. But Esther moved about the kitchen in her taciturn\r\nway, hardly answering. Suddenly she told Mrs. Humphries that she had been\r\nto Dulwich with him, and that it was wonderful how he and Jackie had taken\r\nto one another.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say so! Well, it is nice to find them religious folks less\r\n\'ard-\'earted than they gets the name of."\r\n\r\nMrs. Humphries was of the opinion that henceforth Esther should give\r\nherself out as Jackie\'s aunt. "None believes them stories, but they make\r\none seem more respectable like, and I am sure Mr. Parsons will appreciate\r\nthe intention." Esther did not answer, but she thought of what Mrs.\r\nHumphries had said. Perhaps it would be better if Jackie were to leave off\r\ncalling her Mummie. Auntie! But no, she could not bear it. Fred must take\r\nher as she was or not at all. They seemed to understand each other; he was\r\nearning good money, thirty shillings a week, and she was now going on for\r\neight-and-twenty; if she was ever going to be married it was time to think\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how that dear soul will get on without me," she said one\r\nOctober morning as they jogged out of London by a slow train from St.\r\nPaul\'s. Fred was taking her into Kent to see his people.\r\n\r\n"How do you expect me to get on without you?"\r\n\r\nEsther laughed.\r\n\r\n"Trust you to manage somehow. There ain\'t much fear of a man not looking\r\nafter his little self."\r\n\r\n"But the old folk will want to know when. What shall I tell them?"\r\n\r\n"This time next year; that\'ll be soon enough. Perhaps you\'ll get tired of\r\nme before then."\r\n\r\n"Say next spring, Esther."\r\n\r\nThe train stopped.\r\n\r\n"There\'s father waiting for us in the spring-cart. Father! He don\'t hear\r\nus. He\'s gone a bit deaf of late years. Father!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, so here you are. Train late."\r\n\r\n"This is Esther, father."\r\n\r\nThey were going to spend the day at the farm-house, and she was going to\r\nbe introduced to Fred\'s sisters and to his brother. But these did not\r\nconcern her much, her thoughts were set on Mrs. Parsons, for Fred had\r\nspoken a great deal about his mother. When she had been told about Jackie\r\nshe was of course very sorry; but when she had heard the whole of Esther\'s\r\nstory she had said, "We are all born into temptation, and if your Esther\r\nhas really repented and prayed to be forgiven, we must not say no to her."\r\nNevertheless Esther was not quite easy in her mind, and half regretted\r\nthat she had consented to see Fred\'s people until he had made her his\r\nwife. But it was too late to think of such things. There was the\r\nfarm-house. Fred had just pointed it out, and scenting his stable, the old\r\ngrey ascended the hill at a trot, and Esther wondered what the farm-house\r\nwould be like. All the summer they had had a fine show of flowers, Fred\r\nsaid. Now only a few Michaelmas daisies withered in the garden, and the\r\nVirginia creeper covered one side of the house with a crimson mantle. The\r\nold man said he would take the trap round to the stable, and Fred walked\r\nup the red-bricked pavement and lifted the latch. As they passed through\r\nthe kitchen Fred introduced Esther to his two sisters, Mary and Lily. But\r\nthey were busy cooking.\r\n\r\n"Mother is in the parlour," said Mary; "she is waiting for you." By the\r\nwindow, in a wide wooden arm-chair, sat a large woman about sixty, dressed\r\nin black. She wore on either side of her long white face two corkscrew\r\ncurls, which gave her a somewhat ridiculous appearance. But she ceased to\r\nbe ridiculous or grotesque when she rose from her chair to greet her son.\r\nHer face beamed, and she held out her hands in a beautiful gesture of\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how do you do, dear Fred? I am that glad to see you! How good of you\r\nto come all this way! Come and sit down here."\r\n\r\n"Mother, this is Esther."\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Esther? It was good of you to come. I am glad to see you.\r\nLet me get you a chair. Take off your things, dear; come and sit down."\r\n\r\nShe insisted on relieving Esther of her hat and jacket, and, having laid\r\nthem on the sofa, she waddled across the room, drawing over two chairs.\r\n\r\n"Come and sit down; you\'ll tell me everything. I can\'t get about much now,\r\nbut I like to have my children round me. Take this chair, Esther." Then\r\nturning to Fred, "Tell me, Fred, how you\'ve been getting on. Are you still\r\nliving at Hackney?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother; but when we\'re married we\'re going to have a cottage at\r\nMortlake. Esther will like it better than Hackney. It is nearer the\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ve not forgotten the country. Mortlake is on the river, I think.\r\nI hope you won\'t find it too damp."\r\n\r\n"No, mother, there are some nice cottages there. I think we shall find\r\nthat Mortlake suits us. There are many friends there; more than fifty meet\r\ntogether every Sunday. And there\'s a lot of political work to be done\r\nthere. I know that you\'re against politics, but men can\'t stand aside\r\nnowadays. Times change, mother."\r\n\r\n"So long as we have God in our hearts, my dear boy, all that we do is\r\nwell. But you must want something after your journey. Fred, dear, knock at\r\nthat door. Your sister Clara\'s dressing there. Tell her to make haste."\r\n\r\n"All right, mother," cried a voice from behind the partition which\r\nseparated the rooms, and a moment after the door opened and a young woman\r\nabout thirty entered. She was better-looking than the other sisters, and\r\nthe fashion of her skirt, and the worldly manner with which she kissed her\r\nbrother and gave her hand to Esther, marked her off at once from the rest\r\nof the family. She was forewoman in a large millinery establishment. She\r\nspent Saturday afternoon and Sunday at the farm, but to-day she had got\r\naway earlier, and with the view to impressing Esther, she explained how\r\nthis had come about.\r\n\r\nMrs. Parsons suggested a glass of currant wine, and Lily came in with a\r\ntray and glasses. Clara said she was starving. Mary said she would have to\r\nwait, and Lily whispered, "In about half-an-hour."\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the old man said that they must be getting on with their work\r\nin the orchard. Esther said she would be glad to help, but as she was\r\nabout to follow the others Mrs. Parsons detained her.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mind staying with me a few minutes, do you, dear? I shan\'t keep\r\nyou long." She drew over a chair for Esther. "I shan\'t perhaps see you\r\nagain for some time. I am getting an old woman, and the Lord may be\r\npleased to take me at any moment. I wanted to tell you, dear, that I put\r\nmy trust in you. You will make a good wife to Fred, I feel sure, and he\r\nwill make a good father to your child, and if God blesses you with other\r\nchildren he\'ll treat your first no different than the others. He\'s told me\r\nso, and my Fred is a man of his word. You were led into sin, but you\'ve\r\nrepented. We was all born into temptation, and we must trust to the Lord\r\nto lead us out lest we should dash our foot against a stone."\r\n\r\n"I was to blame; I don\'t say I wasn\'t, but----"\r\n\r\n"We won\'t say no more about that. We\'re all sinners, the best of us.\r\nYou\'re going to be my son\'s wife; you\'re therefore my daughter, and this\r\nhouse is your home whenever you please to come to see us. And I hope that\r\nthat will be often. I like to have my children about me. I can\'t get about\r\nmuch now, so they must come to me. It is very sad not to be able to go to\r\nmeeting. I\'ve not been to meeting since Christmas, but I can see them\r\ngoing there from the kitchen window, and how \'appy they look coming back\r\nfrom prayer. It is easy to see that they have been with God. The\r\nSalvationists come this way sometimes. They stopped in the lane to sing. I\r\ncould not hear the words, but I could see by their faces that they was\r\nwith God... Now, I\'ve told you all that was on my mind. I must not keep\r\nyou; Fred is waiting."\r\n\r\nEsther kissed the old woman, and went into the orchard, where she found\r\nFred on a ladder shaking the branches. He came down when he saw Esther,\r\nand Harry, his brother, took his place. Esther and Fred filled one basket,\r\nthen, yielding to a mutual inclination, they wandered about the orchard,\r\nstopping on the little plank bridge. They hardly spoke at all, words\r\nseemed unnecessary; each felt happiness to be in the other\'s presence.\r\nThey heard the water trickling through the weeds, and as the light waned\r\nthe sound of the falling apples grew more distinct. Then a breeze shivered\r\namong the tops of the apple-trees, and the sered leaves were blown from\r\nthe branches. The voices of the gatherers were heard crying that their\r\nbaskets were full. They crossed the plank bridge, joking the lovers, who\r\nstood aside to let them pass.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the house they saw the old farmer, who had slipped in\r\nbefore them, sitting by his wife holding her hand, patting it in a curious\r\nold-time way, and the attitude of the old couple was so pregnant with\r\nsignificance that it fixed itself on Esther\'s mind. It seemed to her that\r\nshe had never seen anything so beautiful. So they had lived for forty\r\nyears, faithful to each other, and she wondered if Fred forty years hence\r\nwould be sitting by her side holding her hand.\r\n\r\nThe old man lighted a lantern and went round to the stable to get a trap\r\nout. Driving through the dark country, seeing village lights shining out\r\nof the distant solitudes, was a thrilling adventure. A peasant came like a\r\nghost out of the darkness; he stepped aside and called, "Good-night!"\r\nwhich the old farmer answered somewhat gruffly, while Fred answered in a\r\nringing, cheery tone. Never had Esther spent so long and happy a day.\r\nEverything had combined to produce a strange exaltation of the spirit in\r\nher; and she listened to Fred more tenderly than she had done before.\r\n\r\nThe train rattled on through suburbs beginning far away in the country;\r\nrattled on through suburbs that thickened at every mile; rattled on\r\nthrough a brick entanglement; rattled over iron bridges, passed over deep\r\nstreets, over endless lines of lights.\r\n\r\nHe bade her good-bye at the area gate, and she had promised him that they\r\nshould be married in the spring. He had gone away with a light heart. And\r\nshe had run upstairs to tell her dear mistress of the happy day which her\r\nkindness had allowed her to spend in the country. And Miss Rice had laid\r\nthe book she was reading on her knees, and had listened to Esther\'s\r\npleasures as if they had been her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when the spring came Esther put Fred off till the autumn, pleading as\r\nan excuse that Miss Rice had not been very well lately, and that she did\r\nnot like to leave her.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those long and pallid evenings at the end of July, when the\r\nsky seems as if it could not darken. The roadway was very still in its\r\ndust and heat, and Esther, her print dress trailing, watched a poor horse\r\nstriving to pull a four-wheeler through the loose heavy gravel that had\r\njust been laid down. So absorbed was she in her pity for the poor animal\r\nthat she did not see the gaunt, broad-shouldered man coming towards her,\r\nlooking very long-legged in a pair of light grey trousers and a black\r\njacket a little too short for him. He walked with long, even strides, a\r\nsmall cane in one hand, the other in his trousers pocket; a heavy gold\r\nchain showed across his waistcoat. He wore a round hat and a red necktie.\r\nThe side whiskers and the shaven upper lip gave him the appearance of a\r\ngentleman\'s valet. He did not notice Esther, but a sudden step taken\r\nsideways as she lingered, her eyes fixed on the cab-horse, brought her\r\nnearly into collision with him.\r\n\r\n"Do look where you are going to," he exclaimed, jumping back to avoid the\r\nbeer-jug, which fell to the ground. "What, Esther, is it you?"\r\n\r\n"There, you have made me drop the beer."\r\n\r\n"Plenty more in the public; I\'ll get you another jug."\r\n\r\n"It is very kind of you. I can get what I want myself."\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other, and at the end of a long silence William said:\r\n"Just fancy meeting you, and in this way! Well I never! I am glad to see\r\nyou again."\r\n\r\n"Are you really! Well, so much for that--your way and mine aren\'t the\r\nsame. I wish you good evening."\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment, Esther."\r\n\r\n"And my mistress waiting for her dinner. I\'ve to go and get some more\r\nbeer."\r\n\r\n"Shall I wait for you?"\r\n\r\n"Wait for me! I should think not, indeed."\r\n\r\nEsther ran down the area steps. Her hand paused as it was about to lift\r\nthe jug down from the dresser, and a number of thoughts fled across her\r\nmind. That man would be waiting for her outside. What was she to do? How\r\nunfortunate! If he continued to come after her he and Fred would be sure\r\nto meet.\r\n\r\n"What are you waiting for, I should like to know?" she cried, as she came\r\nup the steps.\r\n\r\n"That\'s \'ardly civil, Esther, and after so many years too; one would\r\nthink--"\r\n\r\n"I want none of your thinking; get out of my sight. Do you \'ear? I want no\r\ntruck with you whatever. Haven\'t you done me enough mischief already?"\r\n\r\n"Be quiet; listen to me. I\'ll explain."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want none of your explanation. Go away."\r\n\r\nHer whole nature was now in full revolt, and quick with passionate\r\nremembrance of the injustice that had been done her, she drew back from\r\nhim, her eyes flashing. Perhaps it was some passing remembrance of the\r\nbreakage of the first beer-jug that prevented her from striking him with\r\nthe second. The spasm passed, and then her rage, instead of venting itself\r\nin violent action, assumed the form of dogged silence. He followed her up\r\nthe street, and into the bar. She handed the jug across the counter, and\r\nwhile the barman filled it searched in her pocket for the money. She had\r\nbrought none with her. William promptly produced sixpence. Esther answered\r\nhim with a quick, angry glance, and addressing the barman, she said, "I\'ll\r\npay you to-morrow; that\'ll do, I suppose? 41 Avondale Road."\r\n\r\n"That will be all right, but what am I to do with this sixpence?"\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about that," Esther said, picking up her skirt; "I\'ll pay\r\nyou for what I have had."\r\n\r\nHolding the sixpence in his short, thick, and wet fingers, the barman\r\nlooked at William. William smiled, and said, "Well, they do run sulky\r\nsometimes."\r\n\r\nHe caught at the leather strap and pulled the door open for her, and as\r\nshe passed out she became aware that William still admired her. It was\r\nreally too bad, and she was conscious of injustice. Having destroyed her\r\nlife, this man had passed out of sight and knowledge, but only to reappear\r\nwhen a vista leading to a new life seemed open before her.\r\n\r\n"It was that temper of yours that did it; you wouldn\'t speak to me for a\r\nfortnight. You haven\'t changed, I can see that," he said, watching\r\nEsther\'s face, which did not alter until he spoke of how unhappy he had\r\nbeen in his marriage. "A regular brute she was--we\'re no longer together,\r\nyou know; haven\'t been for the last three years; could not put up with\r\n\'er. She was that--but that\'s a long story." Esther did not answer him. He\r\nlooked at her anxiously, and seeing that she would not be won over easily,\r\nhe spoke of his money.\r\n\r\n"Look \'ere, Esther," he said, laying his hand on the area gate. "You won\'t\r\nrefuse to come out with me some Sunday. I\'ve a half a share in a\r\npublic-house, the \'King\'s Head,\' and have been backing winners all this\r\nyear. I\'ve plenty of money to treat you. I should like to make it up to\r\nyou. Perhaps you\'ve \'ad rather a \'ard time. What \'ave yer been doing all\r\nthese years? I want to hear."\r\n\r\n"What \'ave I been doing? Trying to bring up your child! That\'s what I\'ve\r\nbeen doing."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a child, then, is there?" said William, taken aback. Before he\r\ncould recover himself Esther had slipped past him down the area into the\r\nhouse. For a moment he looked as if he were going to follow her; on second\r\nthoughts he thought he had better not. He lingered a moment and then\r\nwalked slowly away in the direction of the Metropolitan Railway.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to \'ave kept you waiting, miss, but I met with an accident and\r\nhad to come back for another jug."\r\n\r\n"And what was the accident you met with, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t paying no attention, miss; I was looking at a cab that could\r\nhardly get through the stones they\'ve been laying down in the Pembroke\r\nRoad; the poor little horse was pulling that \'ard that I thought he\'d drop\r\ndown dead, and while I was looking I ran up against a passer-by, and being\r\na bit taken aback I dropped the jug."\r\n\r\n"How was that? Did you know the passer-by?"\r\n\r\nEsther busied herself with the dishes on the sideboard; and, divining that\r\nsomething serious had happened to her servant, Miss Rice refrained and\r\nallowed the dinner to pass in silence. Half-an-hour later Esther came into\r\nthe study with her mistress\'s tea. She brought over the wicker table, and\r\nas she set it by her mistress\'s knees the shadows about the bookcase and\r\nthe light of the lamp upon the book and the pensive content on Miss Rice\'s\r\nface impelled her to think of her own troubles, the hardship, the passion,\r\nthe despair of her life compared with this tranquil existence. Never had\r\nshe felt more certain that misfortune was inherent in her life. She\r\nremembered all the trouble she had had, she wondered how she had come out\r\nof it all alive; and now, just as things seemed like settling, everything\r\nwas going to be upset again. Fred was away for a fortnight\'s holiday--she\r\nwas safe for eleven or twelve days. After that she did not know what might\r\nnot happen. Her instinct told her that although he had passed over her\r\nfault very lightly, so long as he knew nothing of the father of her child,\r\nhe might not care to marry her if William continued to come after her. Ah!\r\nif she hadn\'t happened to go out at that particular time she might never\r\nhave met William. He did not live in the neighbourhood; if he did they\r\nwould have met before. Perhaps he had just settled in the neighbourhood.\r\nThat would be worst of all. No, no, no; it was a mere accident; if the\r\ncask of beer had held out a day or two longer, or if it had run out a day\r\nor two sooner, she might never have met William! But now she could not\r\nkeep out of his way. He spent the whole day in the street waiting for her.\r\nIf she went out on an errand he followed her there and back. If she\'d only\r\nlisten. She was prettier than ever. He had never cared for any one else.\r\nHe would marry her when he got his divorce, and then the child would be\r\ntheirs. She did not answer him, but her blood boiled at the word "theirs."\r\nHow could Jackie become their child? Was it not she who had worked for\r\nhim, brought him up? and she thought as little of his paternity as if he\r\nhad fallen from heaven into her arms.\r\n\r\nOne evening as she was laying the table her grief took her unawares, and\r\nshe was obliged to dash aside the tears that had risen to her eyes. The\r\naction was so apparent that Miss Rice thought it would be an affectation\r\nto ignore it. So she said in her kind, musical, intimate manner, "Esther,\r\nI\'m afraid you have some trouble on your mind; can I do anything for you?"\r\n\r\n"No, miss, no, it\'s nothing; I shall get over it presently."\r\n\r\nBut the effort of speaking was too much for her, and a bitter sob caught\r\nher in the throat.\r\n\r\n"You had better tell me your trouble, Esther; even if I cannot help you it\r\nwill ease your heart to tell me about it. I hope nothing is the matter\r\nwith Jackie?"\r\n\r\n"No, miss, no; thank God, he\'s well enough. It\'s nothing to do with him;\r\nleastways--" Then with a violent effort she put back her tears. "Oh, it is\r\nsilly of me," she said, "and your dinner getting cold."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to pry into your affairs, Esther, but you know that----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, I know you to be kindness itself; but there\'s nothing to be\r\ndone but to bear it. You asked me just now if it had anything to do with\r\nJackie. Well, it is no more than that his father has come back."\r\n\r\n"But surely, Esther, that\'s hardly a reason for sorrow; I should have\r\nthought that you would have been glad."\r\n\r\n"It is only natural that you should think so, miss; them what hasn\'t been\r\nthrough the trouble never thinks the same as them that has. You see, miss,\r\nit is nearly nine years since I\'ve seen him, and during them nine years I\r\n\'ave been through so much. I \'ave worked and slaved, and been through all\r\nthe \'ardship, and now, when the worst is over, he comes and wants me to\r\nmarry him when he gets his divorce."\r\n\r\n"Then you like some one else better?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, I do, and what makes it so \'ard to bear is that for the last\r\ntwo months or more I\'ve been keeping company with Fred Parsons--that\'s the\r\nstationer\'s assistant; you\'ve seen him in the shop, miss--and he and me is\r\nengaged to be married. He\'s earning good money, thirty shillings a week;\r\nhe\'s as good a young man as ever stepped--religious, kind-hearted,\r\neverything as would make a woman \'appy in \'er \'ome. It is \'ard for a girl\r\nto keep up with \'er religion in some of the situations we have to put up\r\nwith, and I\'d mostly got out of the habit of chapel-going till I met him;\r\nit was \'e who led me back again to Christ. But for all that, understanding\r\nvery well, not to say indulgent for the failings of others, like yourself,\r\nmiss. He knew all about Jackie from the first, and never said nothing\r\nabout it, but that I must have suffered cruel, which I have. He\'s been\r\nwith me to see Jackie, and they both took to each other wonderful like; it\r\ncouldn\'t \'ave been more so if \'e\'d been \'is own father. But now all that\'s\r\nbroke up, for when Fred meets William it is as likely as not as he\'ll\r\nthink quite different."\r\n\r\nThe evening died behind the red-brick suburb, and Miss Rice\'s strip of\r\ngarden grew greener. She had finished her dinner, and she leaned back\r\nthinking of the story she had heard. She was one of those secluded maiden\r\nladies so common in England, whose experience of life is limited to a tea\r\nparty, and whose further knowledge of life is derived from the\r\nyellow-backed French novels which fill their bookcases.\r\n\r\n"How was it that you happened to meet William--I think you said his name\r\nwas William?"\r\n\r\n"It was the day, miss, that I went to fetch the beer from the\r\npublic-house. It was he that made me drop the jug; you remember, miss, I\r\nhad to come back for another. I told you about it at the time. When I went\r\nout again with a fresh jug he was waiting for me, he followed me to the\r\n\'Greyhound\' and wanted to pay for the beer--not likely that I\'d let him; I\r\ntold them to put it on the slate, and that I\'d pay for it to-morrow. I\r\ndidn\'t speak to him on leaving the bar, but he followed me to the gate. He\r\nwanted to know what I\'d been doing all the time. Then my temper got the\r\nbetter of me, and I said, \'Looking after your child.\' \'My child!\' says he.\r\n\'So there\'s a child, is there?\'"\r\n\r\n"I think you told me that he married one of the young ladies at the place\r\nyou were then in situation?"\r\n\r\n"Young lady! No fear, she wasn\'t no young lady. Anyway, she was too good\r\nor too bad for him; for they didn\'t get on, and are now living separate."\r\n\r\n"Does he speak about the child? Does he ask to see him?"\r\n\r\n"Lor\', yes, miss; he\'d the cheek to say the other day that we\'d make him\r\nour child--our child, indeed! and after all these years I\'ve been working\r\nand he doing nothing."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he might like to do something for him; perhaps that\'s what he\'s\r\nthinking of."\r\n\r\n"No, miss, I know him better than that. That\'s his cunning; he thinks\r\nhe\'ll get me through the child."\r\n\r\n"In any case I don\'t see what you\'ll gain by refusing to speak to him; if\r\nyou want to do something for the child, you can. You said he was\r\nproprietor of a public-house."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want his money; please God, we\'ll be able to do without it to the\r\nend."\r\n\r\n"If I were to die to-morrow, Esther, remember that you would be in exactly\r\nthe same position as you were when you entered my service. You remember\r\nwhat that was? You have often told me there was only eighteen-pence\r\nbetween you and the workhouse; you owed Mrs. Lewis two weeks\' money for\r\nthe support of the child. I daresay you\'ve saved a little money since\r\nyou\'ve been with me, but it cannot be more than a few pounds. I don\'t\r\nthink that you ought to let this chance slip through your fingers, if not\r\nfor your own, for Jackie\'s sake. William, according to his own account, is\r\nmaking money. He may become a rich man; he has no children by his wife; he\r\nmight like to leave some of his money--in any case, he\'d like to leave\r\nsomething--to Jackie."\r\n\r\n"He was always given to boasting about money. I don\'t believe all he says\r\nabout money or anything else."\r\n\r\n"That may be, but he may have money, and you have no right to refuse to\r\nallow him to provide for Jackie. Supposing later on Jackie were to\r\nreproach you?"\r\n\r\n"Jackie\'d never do that, miss; he\'d know I acted for the best."\r\n\r\n"If you again found yourself out of a situation, and saw Jackie crying for\r\nhis dinner, you\'d reproach yourself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I should, miss."\r\n\r\n"I know you are very obstinate, Esther. When does Parsons return?"\r\n\r\n"In about a week, miss."\r\n\r\n"Without telling William anything about Parsons, you\'ll be able to find\r\nout whether it is his intention to interfere in your life. I quite agree\r\nwith you that it is important that the two men should not meet; but it\r\nseems to me, by refusing to speak to William, by refusing to let him see\r\nJackie, you are doing all you can to bring about the meeting that you wish\r\nto avoid. Is he much about here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, he seems hardly ever out of the street, and it do look so bad\r\nfor the \'ouse. I do feel that ashamed. Since I\'ve been with you, miss, I\r\ndon\'t think you\'ve \'ad to complain of followers."\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t you see, you foolish girl, that he\'ll remain hanging about,\r\nand the moment Parsons comes back he\'ll hear of it. You\'d better see to\r\nthis at once."\r\n\r\n"Whatever you says, miss, always do seem right, some \'ow. What you says do\r\nseem that reasonable, and yet I don\'t know how to bring myself to go to\r\n\'im. I told \'im that I didn\'t want no truck with \'im."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think you said so. It is a delicate matter to advise anyone in,\r\nbut I feel sure I am right when I say that you have no right to refuse to\r\nallow him to do something for the child. Jackie is now eight years old,\r\nyou\'ve not the means of giving him a proper education, and you know the\r\ndisadvantage it has been to you not to know how to read and write."\r\n\r\n"Jackie can read beautifully--Mrs. Lewis \'as taught him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Esther; but there\'s much besides reading and writing. Think over\r\nwhat I\'ve said; you\'re a sensible girl; think it out when you go to bed\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\nNext day, seeing William in the street, she went upstairs to ask Miss\r\nRice\'s permission to go out. "Could you spare me, miss, for an hour or\r\nso?" was all she said. Miss Rice, who had noticed a man loitering,\r\nreplied, "Certainly, Esther."\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t afraid to be left in the house alone, miss? I shan\'t be far\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"No. I am expecting Mr. Alden. I\'ll let him in, and can make the tea\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nEsther ran up the area steps and walked quickly down the street, as if she\r\nwere going on an errand. William crossed the road and was soon alongside\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so \'ard on a chap," he said. "Just listen to reason."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to listen to you; you can\'t have much to say that I care\r\nfor."\r\n\r\nHer tone was still stubborn, but he perceived that it contained a change\r\nof humour.\r\n\r\n"Come for a little walk, and then, if you don\'t agree with what I says,\r\nI\'ll never come after you again."\r\n\r\n"You must take me for a fool if you think I\'d pay attention to your\r\npromises."\r\n\r\n"Esther, hear me out; you\'re very unforgiving, but if you\'d hear me\r\nout----"\r\n\r\n"You can speak; no one\'s preventing you that I can see."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say it off like that; it is a long story. I know that I\'ve\r\nbehaved badly to you, but it wasn\'t as much my fault as you think; I could\r\nexplain a good lot of it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care about your explanations. If you\'ve only got\r\nexplanations----"\r\n\r\n"There\'s that boy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is the boy you\'re thinking of?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and you too, Esther. The mother can\'t be separated from the child."\r\n\r\n"Very likely; the father can, though."\r\n\r\n"If you talk that snappish I shall never get out what I\'ve to say. I\'ve\r\ntreated you badly, and it is to make up for the past as far as I can--"\r\n\r\n"And how do you know that you aren\'t doing harm by coming after me?"\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'re keeping company with a chap and don\'t want me?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know I\'m not a married woman; you don\'t know what kind of\r\nsituation I\'m in. You comes after me just because it pleases your fancy,\r\nand don\'t give it a thought that you mightn\'t get me the sack, as you got\r\nit me before."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no use nagging; just let\'s go where we can have a talk, and then\r\nif you aren\'t satisfied you can go your way and I can go mine. You said I\r\ndidn\'t know that you wasn\'t married. I don\'t, but if you aren\'t, so much\r\nthe better. If you are, you\'ve only to say so and I\'ll take my hook. I\'ve\r\ndone quite enough harm, without coming between you and your husband."\r\n\r\nWilliam spoke earnestly, and his words came so evidently from his heart\r\nthat Esther was touched against her will.\r\n\r\n"No, I ain\'t married yet," she replied.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad of that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what odds it can make to you whether I\'m married or not. If I\r\nain\'t married, you are."\r\n\r\nWilliam and Esther walked on in silence, listening to the day as it hushed\r\nin quiet suburban murmurs. The sky was almost colourless--a faded grey,\r\nthat passed into an insignificant blue; and upon this almost neutral tint\r\nthe red suburb appeared in rigid outline, like a carving. At intervals the\r\nwind raised a cloud of dust in the roadway. Stopping before a piece of\r\nwaste ground, William said--\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go in there; we\'ll be able to talk easier." Esther raised no\r\nobjection. They went in and looked for a place where they could sit down.\r\n\r\n"This is just like old times," said William, moving a little closer.\r\n\r\n"If you are going to begin any of that nonsense I\'ll get up and go. I only\r\ncame out with you because you said you had something particular to say\r\nabout the child."\r\n\r\n"Well, it is only natural that I should like to see my son."\r\n\r\n"How do you know it\'s a son?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you said so. I should like it to be a boy--is it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is a boy, and a lovely boy too; very different to his father.\r\nI\'ve always told him that his father is dead."\r\n\r\n"And is he sorry?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit. I\'ve told him his father wasn\'t good to me; and he don\'t care\r\nfor those who haven\'t been good to his mother."\r\n\r\n"I see, you\'ve brought him up to hate me?"\r\n\r\n"He don\'t know nothing about you--how should \'e?"\r\n\r\n"Very likely; but there\'s no need to be that particular nasty. As I\'ve\r\nsaid before, what\'s done can\'t be undone. I treated you badly, I know\r\nthat; and I\'ve been badly treated myself--damned badly treated. You\'ve \'ad\r\na \'ard time; so have I, if that\'s any comfort to ye."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is wrong of me, but seeing you has brought up a deal of\r\nbitterness, more than I thought there was in me."\r\n\r\nWilliam lay at length, his body resting on one arm. He held a long grass\r\nstalk between his small, discoloured teeth. The conversation had fallen.\r\nHe looked at Esther; she sat straight up, her stiff cotton dress spread\r\nover the rough grass; her cloth jacket was unbuttoned. He thought her a\r\nnice-looking woman and he imagined her behind the bar of the "King\'s\r\nHead." His marriage had proved childless and in every way a failure; he\r\nnow desired a wife such as he felt sure she would be, and his heart\r\nhankered sorely after his son. He tried to read Esther\'s quiet, subdued\r\nface. It was graver than usual, and betrayed none of the passion that\r\nchoked in her. She must manage that the men should not meet. But how\r\nshould she rid herself of him? She noticed that he was looking at her, and\r\nto lead his thoughts away from herself she asked him where he had gone\r\nwith his wife when they left Woodview. Breaking off suddenly, he said--\r\n\r\n"Peggy knew all the time I was gone on you."\r\n\r\n"It don\'t matter about that. Tell me where you went--they said you went\r\nforeign."\r\n\r\n"We first went to Boulogne, that\'s in France; but nearly everyone speaks\r\nEnglish there, and there was a nice billiard room handy, where all the big\r\nbetting men came in of an evening. We went to the races. I backed three\r\nwinners on the first day--the second I didn\'t do so well. Then we went on\r\nto Paris. The race-meetings is very \'andy--I will say that for\r\nParis--half-an-hour\'s drive and there you are."\r\n\r\n"Did your wife like Paris?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she liked it pretty well--it is all the place for fashion, and the\r\nshops is grand; but she got tired of it too, and we went to Italy."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s down south. A beast of a place--nothing but sour wine, and all the\r\ncookery done in oil, and nothing to do but seeing picture-galleries. I got\r\nthat sick of it I could stand it no longer, and I said, \'I\'ve \'ad enough\r\nof this. I want to go home, where I can get a glass of Burton and a cut\r\nfrom the joint, and where there\'s a horse worth looking at.\'"\r\n\r\n"But she was very fond of you. She must have been."\r\n\r\n"She was, in her way. But she always liked talking to the singers and the\r\npainters that we met out there. Nothing wrong, you know. That was after we\r\nhad been married about three years."\r\n\r\n"What was that?"\r\n\r\n"That I caught her out."\r\n\r\n"How do you know there was anything wrong? Men always think bad of women."\r\n\r\n"No, it was right enough! she had got dead sick of me, and I had got dead\r\nsick of her. It never did seem natural like. There was no \'omeliness in\r\nit, and a marriage that ain\'t \'omely is no marriage for me. Her friends\r\nweren\'t my friends; and as for my friends, she never left off insulting me\r\nabout them. If I was to ask a chap in she wouldn\'t sit in the same room\r\nwith him. That\'s what it got to at last. And I was always thinking of you,\r\nand your name used to come up when we was talking. One day she said, \'I\r\nsuppose you are sorry you didn\'t marry a servant?\' and I said, \'I suppose\r\nyou are sorry you did?\'"\r\n\r\n"That was a good one for her. Did she say she was?"\r\n\r\n"She put her arms round my neck and said she loved none but her big Bill.\r\nBut all her flummery didn\'t take me in. And I says to myself, \'Keep an eye\r\non her.\' For there was a young fellow hanging about in a manner I didn\'t\r\nparticularly like. He was too anxious to be polite to me, he talked to me\r\nabout \'orses, and I could see he knew nothing about them. He even went so\r\nfar as go down to Kempton with me."\r\n\r\n"And how did it all end?"\r\n\r\n"I determined to keep my eye on this young whipper-snapper, and come up\r\nfrom Ascot by an earlier train than they expected me. I let myself in and\r\nran up to the drawing-room. They were there sitting side by side on the\r\nsofa. I could see they were very much upset. The young fellow turned red,\r\nand he got up, stammering, and speaking a lot of rot.\r\n\r\n"\'What! you back already? How did you get on at Ascot? Had a good day?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Rippin\'; but I\'m going to have a better one now,\' I said, keeping my eye\r\nall the while on my wife. I could see by her face that there was no doubt\r\nabout it. Then I took him by the throat. \'I just give you two minutes to\r\nconfess the truth; I know it, but I want to hear it from you. Now, out\r\nwith it, or I\'ll strangle you.\' I gave him a squeeze just to show him that\r\nI meant it. He turned up his eyes, and my wife cried, \'Murder!\' I threw\r\nhim back from me and got between her and the door, locked it, and put the\r\nkey in my pocket. \'Now,\' I said, \'I\'ll drag the truth out of you both.\' He\r\ndid look white, he shrivelled up by the chimney-piece, and she--well, she\r\nlooked as if she could have killed me, only there was nothing to kill me\r\nwith. I saw her look at the fire-irons. Then, in her nasty sarcastic way,\r\nshe said, \'There\'s no reason, Percy, why he shouldn\'t know. Yes,\' she\r\nsaid, \'he is my lover; you can get your divorce when you like.\'\r\n\r\n"I was a bit taken aback; my idea was to squeeze it all out of the fellow\r\nand shame him before her. But she spoilt my little game there, and I could\r\nsee by her eyes that she knew that she had. \'Now, Percy,\' she said, \'we\'d\r\nbetter go.\' That put my blood up. I said, \'Go you shall, but not till I\r\ngive you leave,\' and without another word I took him by the collar and led\r\nhim to the door; he came like a lamb, and I sent him off with as fine a\r\nkick as he ever got in his life. He went rolling down, and didn\'t stop\r\ntill he got to the bottom. You should have seen her look at me; there was\r\nmurder in her eyes. If she could she\'d have killed me, but she couldn\'t\r\nand calmed down a bit. \'Let me go; what do you want me for? You can get a\r\ndivorce.... I\'ll pay the costs.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I don\'t think I\'d gratify you so much. So you\'d like to marry him, would\r\nyou, my beauty?\'\r\n\r\n"\'He\'s a gentleman, and I\'ve had enough of you; if you want money you\r\nshall have it.\'\r\n\r\n"I laughed at her, and so it went on for an hour or more. Then she\r\nsuddenly calmed down. I knew something was up, only I didn\'t know what. I\r\ndon\'t know if I told you we was in lodgings--the usual sort, drawing-room\r\nwith folding doors, the bedroom at the back. She went into the bedroom,\r\nand I followed, just to make sure she couldn\'t get out that way. There was\r\na chest of drawers before the door; I thought she couldn\'t move it, and\r\nwent back into the sitting-room. But somehow she managed to move it\r\nwithout my hearing her, and before I could stop her she was down the\r\nstairs like lightning. I went after her, but she had too long a start of\r\nme, and the last I heard was the street door go bang."\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused. William took the stalk he was chewing from his\r\nteeth, and threw it aside. Esther had picked one, and with it she beat\r\nimpatiently among the grass.\r\n\r\n"But what has all this to do with me?" she said. "If this is all you have\r\nbrought me out to listen to----"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a nice way to round on me. Wasn\'t it you what asked me to tell you\r\nthe story?"\r\n\r\n"So you\'ve deserted two women instead of one, that\'s about the long and\r\nshort of it."\r\n\r\n"Well, if that\'s what you think I\'d better be off," said William, and he\r\nrose to his feet and stood looking at her. She sat quite still, not daring\r\nto raise her eyes; her heart was throbbing violently. Would he go away and\r\nnever come back? Should she answer him indifferently or say nothing? She\r\nchose the latter course. Perhaps it was the wrong one, for her dogged\r\nsilence irritated him, and he sat down and begged of her to forgive him.\r\nHe would wait for her. Then her heart ceased throbbing, and a cold\r\nnumbness came over her hands.\r\n\r\n"My wife thought that I had no money, and could do what she liked with me.\r\nBut I had been backing winners all the season, and had a couple of\r\nthousand in the bank. I put aside a thousand for working expenses, for I\r\nintended to give up backing horses and go in for bookmaking instead. I\r\nhave been at it ever since. A few ups and downs, but I can\'t complain. I\r\nam worth to-day close on three thousand pounds."\r\n\r\nAt the mention of so much money Esther raised her eyes. She looked at\r\nWilliam steadfastly. Her object was to rid herself of him, so that she\r\nmight marry another man; but at that moment a sensation of the love she\r\nhad once felt for him sprang upon her suddenly.\r\n\r\n"I must be getting back, my mistress will be waiting for me."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be in that hurry. It is quite early. Besides, we haven\'t\r\nsettled nothing yet."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been telling me about your wife. I don\'t see much what it\'s got to\r\ndo with me."\r\n\r\n"I thought you was interested... that you wanted to see that I wasn\'t as\r\nmuch to blame as you thought."\r\n\r\n"I must be getting back," she said; "anything else you have to say to me\r\nyou can tell me on the way home."\r\n\r\n"Well, it all amounts to this, Esther; if I get a divorce we might come\r\ntogether again. What do you think?"\r\n\r\n"I think you\'d much better make it up with her. I daresay she\'s very sorry\r\nfor what she\'s done."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all rot, Esther. She ain\'t sorry, and wouldn\'t live with me no\r\nmore than I with her. We could not get on; what\'s the use? You\'d better\r\nlet bygones be bygones. You know what I mean--marry me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I could do that."\r\n\r\n"You like some other chap. You like some chap, and don\'t want me\r\ninterfering in your life. That\'s why you wants me to go back and live with\r\nmy wife. You don\'t think of what I\'ve gone through with her already."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve not been through half of what I have. I\'ll be bound that you never\r\nwanted a dinner. I have."\r\n\r\n"Esther, think of the child."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a nice one to tell me to think of the child, I who worked and\r\nslaved for him all these years."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m to take no for an answer?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to have nothing to do with you."\r\n\r\n"And you won\'t let me see the child?"\r\n\r\nA moment later Esther answered, "You can see the child, if you like."\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"You can come with me to see him next Sunday, if you like. Now let me go\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"What time shall I come for you?"\r\n\r\n"About three--a little after."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was waiting for her in the area; and while pinning on her hat she\r\nthought of what she should say, and how she should act. Should she tell\r\nhim that she wanted to marry Fred? Then the long black pin that was to\r\nhold her hat to her hair went through the straw with a little sharp sound,\r\nand she decided that when the time came she would know what to say.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped aside to let her go up the area steps, she noticed how\r\nbeautifully dressed he was. He wore a pair of grey trousers, and in his\r\nspick and span morning coat there was a bunch of carnations.\r\n\r\nThey walked some half-dozen yards up the street in silence.\r\n\r\n"But why do you want to see the boy? You never thought of him all these\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you, Esther.... But it is nice to be walking out with you\r\nagain. If you\'d only let bygones be bygones we might settle down together\r\nyet. What do you think?"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, and he continued, "It do seem strange to be walking\r\nout with you again, meeting you after all these years, and I\'m never in\r\nyour neighbourhood. I just happened to have a bit of business with a\r\nfriend who lives your way, and was coming along from his \'ouse, turning\r\nover in my mind what he had told me about Rising Sun for the Stewards\'\r\nCup, when I saw you coming along with the jug in your \'and. I said,\r\n\'That\'s the prettiest girl I\'ve seen this many a day; that\'s the sort of\r\ngirl I\'d like to see behind the bar of the "King\'s Head."\' You always\r\nkeeps your figure--you know you ain\'t a bit changed; and when I caught\r\nsight of those white teeth I said, \'Lor\', why, it\'s Esther.\'"\r\n\r\n"I thought it was about the child you was going to speak to me."\r\n\r\n"So I am, but you came first in my estimation. The moment I looked into\r\nyour eyes I felt it had been a mistake all along, and that you was the\r\nonly one I had cared about."\r\n\r\n"Then all about wanting to see the child was a pack of lies?"\r\n\r\n"No, they weren\'t lies. I wanted both mother and child--if I could get\r\n\'em, ye know. I\'m telling you the unvarnished truth, Esther. I thought of\r\nthe child as a way of getting you back; but little by little I began to\r\ntake an interest in him, to wonder what he was like, and with thoughts of\r\nthe boy came different thoughts of you, Esther, who is the mother of my\r\nboy. Then I wanted you both back; and I\'ve thought of nothing else ever\r\nsince."\r\n\r\nAt that moment they reached the Metropolitan Railway, and William pressed\r\nforward to get the tickets. A subterraneous rumbling was heard, and they\r\nran down the steps as fast as they could, and seeing them so near the\r\nticket-collector held the door open for them, and just as the train was\r\nmoving from the platform William pushed Esther into a second-class\r\ncompartment.\r\n\r\n"We\'re in the wrong class," she cried.\r\n\r\n"No, we ain\'t; get in, get in," he shouted. And with the guard crying to\r\nhim to desist, he hopped in after her, saying, "You very nearly made me\r\nmiss the train. What \'ud you\'ve done if the train had taken you away and\r\nleft me behind?"\r\n\r\nThe remark was not altogether a happy one.\r\n\r\n"Then you travel second-class?" Esther said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I always travel second-class now; Peggy never would, but second\r\nseems to me quite good enough. I don\'t care about third, unless one is\r\nwith a lot of pals, and can keep the carriage to ourselves. That\'s the way\r\nwe manage it when we go down to Newmarket or Doncaster."\r\n\r\nThey were alone in the compartment. William leaned forward and took her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Try to forgive me, Esther."\r\n\r\nShe drew her hand away; he got up, and sat down beside her, and put his\r\narm around her waist.\r\n\r\n"No, no. I\'ll have none of that. All that sort of thing is over between\r\nus."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her inquisitively, not knowing how to act.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'ve had a hard time, Esther. Tell me about it. What did you do\r\nwhen you left Woodview?" He unfortunately added, "Did you ever meet any\r\none since that you cared for?"\r\n\r\nThe question irritated her, and she said, "It don\'t matter to you who I\r\nmet or what I went through."\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused. William spoke about the Barfields, and Esther\r\ncould not but listen to the tale of what had happened at Woodview during\r\nthe last eight years.\r\n\r\nWoodview had been all her unhappiness and all her misfortune. She had gone\r\nthere when the sap of life was flowing fastest in her, and Woodview had\r\nbecome the most precise and distinct vision she had gathered from life.\r\nShe remembered that wholesome and ample country house, with its park and\r\nits down lands, and the valley farm, sheltered by the long lines of elms.\r\nShe remembered the race-horses, their slight forms showing under the grey\r\nclothing, the round black eyes looking out through the eyelet holes in the\r\nhanging hoods, the odd little boys astride--a string of six or seven\r\npassing always before the kitchen windows, going through the paddock gate\r\nunder the bunched evergreens. She remembered the rejoicings when the horse\r\nwon at Goodwood, and the ball at the Shoreham Gardens. Woodview had meant\r\ntoo much in her life to be forgotten; its hillside and its people were\r\ndrawn out in sharp outline on her mind. Something in William\'s voice\r\nrecalled her from her reverie, and she heard him say--\r\n\r\n"The poor Gaffer, \'e never got over it; it regular broke \'im up. I forgot\r\nto tell you, it was Ginger who was riding. It appears that he did all he\r\nknew; he lost start, he tried to get shut in, but it warn\'t no go, luck\r\nwas against them; the \'orse was full of running, and, of course, he\r\ncouldn\'t sit down and saw his blooming \'ead off, right in th\' middle of\r\nthe course, with Sir Thomas\'s (that\'s the \'andicapper) field-glasses on\r\nhim. He\'d have been warned off the blooming \'eath, and he couldn\'t afford\r\nthat, even to save his own father. The \'orse won in a canter: they clapped\r\neight stun on him for the Cambridgeshire. It broke the Gaffer\'s \'eart. He\r\nhad to sell off his \'orses, and he died soon after the sale. He died of\r\nconsumption. It generally takes them off earlier; but they say it is in\r\nthe family. Miss May----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell me about her," said Esther, who had been thinking all the while\r\nof Mrs. Barfield and of Miss Mary. "Tell me, there\'s nothing the matter\r\nwith Miss Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is: she can\'t live no more in England; she has to go to\r\nwinter, I think it is, in Algeria."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the train screeched along the rails, and vibrating under\r\nthe force of the brakes, it passed out of the tunnel into Blackfriars.\r\n\r\n"We shall just be able to catch the ten minutes past four to Peckham," she\r\nsaid, and they ran up the high steps. William strode along so fast that\r\nEsther was obliged to cry out, "There\'s no use, William; train or no\r\ntrain, I can\'t walk at that rate."\r\n\r\nThere was just time for them to get their tickets at Ludgate Hill. They\r\nwere in a carriage by themselves, and he proposed to draw up the windows\r\nso that they might be able to talk more easily. He was interested in the\r\nill-luck that had attended certain horses, and Esther wanted to hear about\r\nMrs. Barfield.\r\n\r\n"You seem to be very fond of her; what did she do for you?"\r\n\r\n"Everything--that was after you went away. She was kind."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to hear that," said William.\r\n\r\n"So they spends the summer at Woodview and goes to foreign parts for the\r\nwinter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it. Most of the estate was sold; but Mrs. Barfield, the\r\nSaint--you remember we used to call her the Saint--well, she has her\r\nfortune, about five hundred a year, and they just manage to live there in\r\na sort of hole-and-corner sort of way. They can\'t afford to keep a trap,\r\nand towards the end of October they go off and don\'t return till the\r\nbeginning of May. Woodview ain\'t what it was. You remember the stables\r\nthey were putting up when Silver Braid won the two cups? Well, they are\r\njust as when you last saw them--rafters and walls."\r\n\r\n"Racing don\'t seem to bring no luck to any one. It ain\'t my affair, but if\r\nI was you I\'d give it up and get to some honest work."\r\n\r\n"Racing has been a good friend to me. I don\'t know where I should be\r\nwithout it to-day."\r\n\r\n"So all the servants have left Woodview? I wonder what has become of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"You remember my mother, the cook? She died a couple of years ago."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Latch! Oh, I\'m so sorry."\r\n\r\n"She was an old woman. You remember John Randal, the butler? He\'s in a\r\nsituation in Cumberland Place, near the Marble Arch. He sometimes comes\r\nround and has a glass in the \'King\'s Head.\' Sarah Tucker--she\'s in a\r\nsituation somewhere in town. I don\'t know what has become of Margaret\r\nGale."\r\n\r\n"I met her one day in the Strand. I\'d had nothing to eat all day. I was\r\nalmost fainting, and she took me into a public-house and gave me a\r\nsausage."\r\n\r\nThe train began to slacken speed, and William said, "This is Peckham."\r\n\r\nThey handed up their tickets, and passed into the air of an irregular\r\nlittle street--low disjointed shops and houses, where the tramcars tinkled\r\nthrough a slacker tide of humanity than the Londoners were accustomed to.\r\n\r\n"This way," said Esther. "This is the way to the Rye."\r\n\r\n"Then Jackie lives at the Rye?"\r\n\r\n"Not far from the Rye. Do you know East Dulwich?"\r\n\r\n"No, I never was here before."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lewis (that\'s the woman who looks after him) lives at East Dulwich,\r\nbut it ain\'t very far. I always gets out here. I suppose you don\'t mind a\r\nquarter of an hour\'s walk."\r\n\r\n"Not when I\'m with you," William replied gallantly, and he followed her\r\nthrough the passers-by.\r\n\r\nThe Rye opened up like a large park, beginning in the town and wending far\r\naway into a country prospect. At the Peckham end there were a dozen\r\nhandsome trees, and under them a piece of artificial water where boys were\r\nsailing toy boats, and a poodle was swimming. Two old ladies in black came\r\nout of a garden full of hollyhocks; they walked towards a seat and sat\r\ndown in the autumn landscape. And as William and Esther pursued their way\r\nthe Rye seemed to grow longer and longer. It opened up into a vast expanse\r\nfull of the last days of cricket; it was charming with slender trees and a\r\nJapanese pavilion quaintly placed on a little mound. An upland background\r\nin gradations, interspaced with villas, terraces, and gardens, and steep\r\nhillside, showing fields and hayricks, brought the Rye to a picturesque\r\nand abrupt end.\r\n\r\n"But it ain\'t nearly so big as Chester race-course. A regular cockpit of a\r\nplace is the Chester course; and not every horse can get round it."\r\n\r\nTurning to the right and leaving the Rye behind them, they ascended a\r\nlong, monotonous, and very ugly road composed of artificial little houses,\r\neach set in a portion of very metallic garden. These continued all the way\r\nto the top of a long hill, straggling into a piece of waste ground where\r\nthere were some trees and a few rough cottages. A little boy came running\r\ntowards them, stumbling over the cinder heaps and the tin canisters with\r\nwhich the place was strewn, and William felt that that child was his.\r\n\r\n"That child will break \'is blooming little neck if \'e don\'t take care," he\r\nremarked tentatively.\r\n\r\nShe hated him to see the child, and to assert her complete ownership she\r\nclasped Jackie to her bosom without a word of explanation, and she\r\nquestioned the child on matters about which William knew nothing.\r\n\r\nWilliam stood looking tenderly on his son, waiting for Esther to introduce\r\nthem. Mother and child were both so glad in each other that they forgot\r\nthe fine gentleman standing by. Suddenly the boy looked towards his\r\nfather, and she repented a little of her cruelty.\r\n\r\n"Jackie," she said, "do you know who this gentleman is who has come to see\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t."\r\n\r\nShe did not care that Jackie should love his father, and yet she could not\r\nhelp feeling sorry for William.\r\n\r\n"I\'m your father," said William.\r\n\r\n"No, you ain\'t. I ain\'t got no father."\r\n\r\n"How do you know, Jackie?"\r\n\r\n"Father died before I was born; mother told me."\r\n\r\n"But mother may be mistaken."\r\n\r\n"If my father hadn\'t died before I was born he\'d \'ve been to see us before\r\nthis. Come, mother, come to tea. Mrs. Lewis \'as got hot cakes, and they\'ll\r\nbe burnt if we stand talking."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, but what the gentleman says is quite true; he is your father."\r\n\r\nJackie made no answer, and Esther said, "I told you your father was dead,\r\nbut I was mistaken."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come and walk with me?" said William.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you; I like to walk with mother."\r\n\r\n"He\'s always like that with strangers," said Esther; "it is shyness; but\r\nhe\'ll come and talk to you presently, if you leave him alone."\r\n\r\nEach cottage had a rough piece of garden, the yellow crowns of sunflowers\r\nshowed over the broken palings, and Mrs. Lewis\'s large face came into the\r\nwindowpane. A moment later she was at the front door welcoming her\r\nvisitors. The affection of her welcome was checked when she saw that\r\nWilliam was with Esther, and she drew aside respectfully to let this fine\r\ngentleman pass. When they were in the kitchen Esther said----\r\n\r\n"This is Jackie\'s father."\r\n\r\n"What, never! I thought--but I\'m sure we\'re very glad to see you." Then\r\nnoticing the fine gold chain that hung across his waistcoat, the cut of\r\nhis clothes, and the air of money which his whole bearing seemed to\r\nrepresent, she became a little obsequious in her welcome.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure, sir, we\'re very glad to see you. Won\'t you sit down?" and\r\ndusting a chair with her apron, she handed it to him. Then turning to\r\nEsther, she said--\r\n\r\n"Sit yourself down, dear; tea\'ll be ready in a moment." She was one of\r\nthose women who, although their apron-strings are a good yard in length,\r\npreserve a strange agility of movement and a pleasant vivacity of speech.\r\n"I \'ope, sir, we\'ve brought \'im up to your satisfaction; we\'ve done the\r\nbest we could. He\'s a dear boy. There\'s been a bit of jealousy between us\r\non his account, but for all that we \'aven\'t spoilt him. I don\'t want to\r\npraise him, but he\'s as well behaved a boy as I knows of. Maybe a bit\r\nwilful, but there ain\'t much fault to find with him, and I ought to know,\r\nfor it is I that \'ad the bringing up of him since he was a baby of two\r\nmonths old. Jackie, dear, why don\'t you go to your father?"\r\n\r\nHe stood by his mother\'s chair, twisting his slight legs in a manner that\r\nwas peculiar to him. His dark hair fell in thick, heavy locks over his\r\nsmall face, and from under the shadow of his locks his great luminous eyes\r\nglanced furtively at his father. Mrs. Lewis told him to take his finger\r\nout of his mouth, and thus encouraged he went towards William, still\r\ntwisting his legs and looking curiously dejected. He did not speak for\r\nsome time, but he allowed William to put his arm round him and draw him\r\nagainst his knees. Then fixing his eyes on the toes of his shoes he said\r\nsomewhat abruptly, but confidentially--\r\n\r\n"Are you really my father? No humbug, you know," he added, raising his\r\neyes, and for a moment looking William searchingly in the face.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not humbugging, Jack. I\'m your father right enough. Don\'t you like\r\nme? But I think you said you didn\'t want to have a father?"\r\n\r\nJackie did not answer this question. After a moment\'s reflection, he said,\r\n"If you be father, why didn\'t you come to see us before?"\r\n\r\nWilliam glanced at Esther, who, in her turn, glanced at Mrs. Lewis.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid that\'s rather a long story, Jackie. I was away in foreign\r\nparts."\r\n\r\nJackie looked as if he would like to hear about "foreign parts," and\r\nWilliam awaited the question that seemed to tremble on the child\'s lips.\r\nBut, instead, he turned suddenly to Mrs. Lewis and said--\r\n\r\n"The cakes aren\'t burnt, are they? I ran as fast as I could the moment I\r\nsaw them coming."\r\n\r\nThe childish abruptness of the transition made them laugh, and an\r\nunpleasant moment passed away. Mrs. Lewis took the plate of cakes from the\r\nfender and poured out their tea. The door and window were open, and the\r\ndying light lent a tenderness to the tea table, to the quiet solicitude of\r\nthe mother watching her son, knowing him in all his intimate habits; to\r\nthe eager curiosity of the father on the other side, leaning forward\r\ndelighted at every look and word, thinking it all astonishing, wonderful.\r\nJackie sat between the women. He seemed to understand that his chance of\r\neating as many tea-cakes as he pleased had come, and he ate with his eyes\r\nfixed on the plate, considering which piece he would have when he had\r\nfinished the piece he had in his hand. Little was said--a few remarks\r\nabout the fine weather, and offers to put out another cup of tea. By their\r\nsilence Mrs. Lewis began to understand that they had differences to\r\nsettle, and that she had better leave them. She took her shawl from the\r\npeg, and pleaded that she had an appointment with a neighbour. But she\r\nwouldn\'t be more than half-an-hour; would they look after the house till\r\nher return? And William watched her, thinking of what he would say when\r\nshe was out of hearing. "That boy of ours is a dear little fellow; you\'ve\r\nbeen a good mother, I can see that. If I had only known."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no use talking no more about it; what\'s done is done."\r\n\r\nThe cottage door was open, and in the still evening they could see their\r\nchild swinging on the gate. The moment was tremulous with responsibility,\r\nand yet the words as they fell from their lips seemed accidental.\r\n\r\nAt last he said--\r\n\r\n"Esther, I can get a divorce."\r\n\r\n"You\'d much better go back to your wife. Once married, always married,\r\nthat\'s my way of thinking."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to hear you say it, Esther. Do you think a man should stop with\r\nhis wife who\'s been treated as I have been?"\r\n\r\nEsther avoided a direct reply. Why should he care about the child? He had\r\nnever done anything for him. William said that if he had known there was a\r\nchild he would have left his wife long ago. He believed that he loved the\r\nchild just as much as she did, and didn\'t believe in marriage without\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n"That would have been very wrong."\r\n\r\n"We ain\'t getting no for\'arder by discussing them things," he said,\r\ninterrupting her. "We can\'t say good-bye after this evening and never see\r\none another again."\r\n\r\n"Why not? I\'m nothing to you now; you\'ve got a wife of your own; you\'ve no\r\nclaim upon me; you can go your way and I can keep to mine."\r\n\r\n"There\'s that child. I must do something for him."\r\n\r\n"Well, you can do something for him without ruining me."\r\n\r\n"Ruining you, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ruining me. I ain\'t going to lose my character by keeping company\r\nwith a married man. You\'ve done me harm enough already, and should be\r\nashamed to think of doing me any more. You can pay for the boy\'s schooling\r\nif you like, you can pay for his keep too, but you mustn\'t think that in\r\ndoing so you\'ll get hold of me again."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean it, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"Followers ain\'t allowed where I am. You\'re a married man. I won\'t have\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"But when I get my divorce?"\r\n\r\n"When you get your divorce! I don\'t know how it\'ll be then. But here\'s\r\nMrs. Lewis; she\'s a-scolding of Jackie for swinging on that \'ere gate.\r\nNaughty boy; he\'s been told twenty times not to swing on the gate."\r\n\r\nEsther complained that they had stayed too long, that he had made her\r\nlate, and treated his questions about Jackie with indifference. He might\r\nwrite if he had anything important to say, but she could not keep company\r\nwith a married man. William seemed very downcast. Esther, too, was\r\nunhappy, and she did not know why. She had succeeded as well as she had\r\nexpected, but success had not brought that sense of satisfaction which she\r\nhad expected it would. Her idea had been to keep William out of the way\r\nand hurry on her marriage with Fred. But this marriage, once so ardently\r\ndesired, no longer gave her any pleasure. She had told Fred about the\r\nchild. He had forgiven her. But now she remembered that men were very\r\nforgiving before marriage, but how did she know that he would not reproach\r\nher with her fault the first time they came to disagree about anything?\r\nAh, it was all misfortune. She had no luck. She didn\'t want to marry\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nThat visit to Dulwich had thoroughly upset her. She ought to have kept out\r\nof William\'s way--that man seemed to have a power over her, and she hated\r\nhim for it. What did he want to see the child for? The child was nothing\r\nto him. She had been a fool; now he\'d be after the child; and through this\r\nfever of trouble there raged an acute desire to know what Jackie thought\r\nof his father, what Mrs. Lewis thought of William.\r\n\r\nAnd the desire to know what was happening became intolerable. She went to\r\nher mistress to ask for leave to go out. Very little of her agitation\r\nbetrayed itself in her demeanour, but Miss Rice\'s sharp eyes had guessed\r\nthat her servant\'s life was at a crisis. She laid her book on her knee,\r\nasked a few kind, discreet questions, and after dinner Esther hurried\r\ntowards the Underground.\r\n\r\nThe door of the cottage was open, and as she crossed the little garden she\r\nheard Mrs. Lewis say--\r\n\r\n"Now you must be a good boy, and not go out in the garden and spoil your\r\nnew clothes." And when Esther entered Mrs. Lewis was giving the finishing\r\ntouches to the necktie which she had just tied. "Now you\'ll go and sit on\r\nthat chair, like a good boy, and wait there till your father comes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, here\'s mummie," cried the boy, and he darted out of Mrs. Lewis\'s\r\nhand. "Look at my new clothes, mummie; look at them!" And Esther saw her\r\nboy dressed in a suit of velveteen knickerbockers with brass buttons, and\r\na sky-blue necktie.\r\n\r\n"His father--I mean Mr. Latch--came here on Thursday morning, and took him\r\nto----"\r\n\r\n"Took me up to London----"\r\n\r\n"And brought him back in those clothes."\r\n\r\n"We went to such a big shop in Oxford Street for them, and they took down\r\nmany suits before they could get one to fit. Father is that difficult to\r\nplease, and I thought we should go away without any clothes, and I\r\ncouldn\'t walk about London with father in these old things. Aren\'t they\r\nshabby?" he added, kicking them contemptuously. It was a little grey suit\r\nthat Esther had made for him with her own hands.\r\n\r\n"Father had me measured for another suit, but it won\'t be ready for a few\r\ndays. Father took me to the Zoological Gardens, and we saw the lions and\r\ntigers, and there are such a lot of monkeys. There is one----But what\r\nmakes you look so cross, mummie dear? Don\'t you ever go out with father in\r\nLondon? London is such a beautiful place. And then we walked through the\r\npark and saw a lot of boys sailing boats. Father asked me if I had a boat.\r\nI said you couldn\'t afford to buy me toys. He said that was hard lines on\r\nme, and on the way back to the station we stopped at a toy-shop and he\r\nbought me a boat. May I show you my boat?"\r\n\r\nJackie was too much occupied with thoughts of his boat to notice the gloom\r\nthat was gathering on his mother\'s face; Mrs. Lewis wished to call upon\r\nhim to desist, but before she could make up her mind what to do, he had\r\nbrought the toy from the table and was forcing it into his mother\'s hands.\r\n"This is a cutter-rigged boat, because it has three sails and only one\r\nmast. Father told me it was. He\'ll be here in half-an-hour; we\'re going to\r\nsail the boat in the pond on the Rye, and if it gets across all right\r\nhe\'ll take me to the park where there\'s a big piece of water, twice, three\r\ntimes as big as the water on the Rye. Do you think, mummie, that I shall\r\never be able to get my boat across such a piece of water as the--I\'ve\r\nforgotten the name. What do they call it, mummie?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know; don\'t bother me with your boat."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mummie, what have I done that you won\'t look at my boat? Aren\'t you\r\ncoming with father to the Rye to see me sail it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to go with you. You want me no more. I can\'t afford to give\r\nyou boats.... Come, don\'t plague me any more with your toy," she said,\r\npushing it away, and then in a moment of convulsive passion she threw the\r\nboat across the room. It struck the opposite wall, its mast was broken,\r\nand the sails and cords made a tangled little heap. Jackie ran to his toy,\r\nhe picked it up, and his face showed his grief. "I shan\'t be able to sail\r\nmy boat now; it won\'t sail, its mast and the sails is broke. Mummie, what\r\ndid you break my boat for?" and the child burst into tears. At that moment\r\nWilliam entered.\r\n\r\n"What is the child crying for?" he asked, stopping abruptly on the\r\nthreshold. There was a slight tone of authority in his voice which angered\r\nEsther still more.\r\n\r\n"What is it to you what he is crying for?" she said, turning quickly\r\nround. "What has the child got to do with you that you should come down\r\nordering people about for? A nice sort of mean trick, and one that is just\r\nlike you. You beg and pray of me to let you see the child, and when I do\r\nyou come down here on the sly, and with the present of a suit of clothes\r\nand a toy boat you try to win his love away from his mother."\r\n\r\n"Esther, Esther, I never thought of getting his love from you. I meant no\r\nharm. Mrs. Lewis said that he was looking a trifle moped; we thought that\r\na change would do him good, and so----"\r\n\r\n"Ah! it was Mrs. Lewis that asked you to take him up to London. It is a\r\nstrange thing what a little money will do. Ever since you set foot in this\r\ncottage she has been curtseying to you, handing you chairs. I didn\'t much\r\nlike it, but I didn\'t think that she would round on me in this way." Then\r\nturning suddenly on her old friend, she said, "Who told you to let him\r\nhave the child?... Is it he or I who pays you for his keep? Answer me\r\nthat. How much did he give you--a new dress?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Esther, I am surprised at you: I didn\'t think it would come to\r\naccusing me of being bribed, and after all these years." Mrs. Lewis put\r\nher apron to her eyes, and Jackie stole over to his father.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t I who smashed the boat, it was mummie; she\'s in a passion. I\r\ndon\'t know why she smashed it. I didn\'t do nothing."\r\n\r\nWilliam took the child on his knee.\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t mean to smash it. There\'s a good boy, don\'t cry no more."\r\n\r\nJackie looked at his father. "Will you buy me another? The shops aren\'t\r\nopen to-day." Then getting off his father\'s knee he picked up the toy, and\r\ncoming back he said, "Could we mend the boat somehow? Do you think we\r\ncould?"\r\n\r\n"Jackie, dear, go away; leave your father alone. Go into the next room,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Lewis.\r\n\r\n"No, he can stop here; let him be," said Esther. "I want to have no more\r\nto say to him, he can look to his father for the future." Esther turned on\r\nher heel and walked straight for the door. But dropping his boat with a\r\ncry, the little fellow ran after her and clung to her skirt despairingly.\r\n"No, mummie dear, you mustn\'t go; never mind the boat; I love you better\r\nthan the boat--I\'ll do without a boat."\r\n\r\n"Esther, Esther, this is all nonsense. Just listen."\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t listen to you. But you shall listen to me. When I brought you\r\nhere last week you asked me in the train what I had been doing all these\r\nyears. I didn\'t answer you, but I will now. I\'ve been in the workhouse."\r\n\r\n"In the workhouse!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, do that surprise you?"\r\n\r\nThen jerking out her words, throwing them at him as if they were\r\nhalf-bricks, she told him the story of the last eight years--Queen\r\nCharlotte\'s hospital, Mrs. Rivers, Mrs. Spires, the night on the\r\nEmbankment, and the workhouse.\r\n\r\n"And when I came out of the workhouse I travelled London in search of\r\nsixteen pounds a year wages, which was the least I could do with, and when\r\nI didn\'t find them I sat here and ate dry bread. She\'ll tell you--she saw\r\nit all. I haven\'t said nothing about the shame and sneers I had to put up\r\nwith--you would understand nothing about that,--and there was more than\r\none situation I was thrown out of when they found I had a child. For they\r\ndidn\'t like loose women in their houses; I had them very words said about\r\nme. And while I was going through all that you was living in riches with a\r\nlady in foreign parts; and now when she could put up with you no longer,\r\nand you\'re kicked out, you come to me and ask for your share of the child.\r\nShare of the child! What share is yours, I\'d like to know?"\r\n\r\n"Esther!"\r\n\r\n"In your mean, underhand way you come here on the sly to see if you can\'t\r\nsteal the love of the child from me."\r\n\r\nShe could speak no more; her strength was giving way before the tumult of\r\nher passion, and the silence that had come suddenly into the room was more\r\nterrible than her violent words. William stood quaking, horrified, wishing\r\nthe earth would swallow him; Mrs. Lewis watched Esther\'s pale face,\r\nfearing that she would faint; Jackie, his grey eyes open round, held his\r\nbroken boat still in his hand. The sense of the scene had hardly caught on\r\nhis childish brain; he was very frightened; his tears and sobs were a\r\nwelcome intervention. Mrs. Lewis took him in her arms and tried to soothe\r\nhim. William tried to speak; his lips moved, but no words came.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lewis whispered, "You\'ll get no good out of her now, her temper\'s up;\r\nyou\'d better go. She don\'t know what she\'s a-saying of."\r\n\r\n"If one of us has to go," said William, taking the hint, "there can\'t be\r\nmuch doubt which of us." He stood at the door holding his hat, just as if\r\nhe were going to put it on. Esther stood with her back turned to him. At\r\nlast he said--\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Jackie. I suppose you don\'t want to see me again?"\r\n\r\nFor reply Jackie threw his boat away and clung to Mrs. Lewis for\r\nprotection. William\'s face showed that he was pained by Jackie\'s refusal.\r\n\r\n"Try to get your mother to forgive me; but you are right to love her best.\r\nShe\'s been a good mother to you." He put on his hat and went without\r\nanother word. No one spoke, and every moment the silence grew more\r\nparalysing. Jackie examined his broken boat for a moment, and then he put\r\nit away, as if it had ceased to have any interest for him. There was no\r\nchance of going to the Rye that day; he might as well take off his velvet\r\nsuit; besides, his mother liked him better in his old clothes. When he\r\nreturned his mother was sorry for having broken his boat, and appreciated\r\nthe cruelty. "You shall have another boat, my darling," she said, leaning\r\nacross the table and looking at him affectionately; "and quite as good as\r\nthe one I broke."\r\n\r\n"Will you, mummie? One with three sails, cutter-rigged, like that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, you shall have a boat with three sails."\r\n\r\n"When will you buy me the boat, mummie--to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"As soon as I can, Jackie."\r\n\r\nThis promise appeared to satisfy him. Suddenly he looked--\r\n\r\n"Is father coming back no more?"\r\n\r\n"Do you want him back?"\r\n\r\nJackie hesitated; his mother pressed him for an answer.\r\n\r\n"Not if you don\'t, mummie."\r\n\r\n"But if he was to give you another boat, one with four sails?"\r\n\r\n"They don\'t have four sails, not them with one mast."\r\n\r\n"If he was to give you a boat with two masts, would you take it?"\r\n\r\n"I should try not to, I should try ever so hard."\r\n\r\nThere were tears in Jackie\'s voice, and then, as if doubtful of his power\r\nto resist temptation, he buried his face in his mother\'s bosom and sobbed\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n"You shall have another boat, my darling."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want no boat at all! I love you better than a boat, mummie,\r\nindeed I do."\r\n\r\n"And what about those clothes? You\'d sooner stop with me and wear those\r\nshabby clothes than go to him and wear a pretty velvet suit?"\r\n\r\n"You can send back the velvet suit."\r\n\r\n"Can I? My darling, mummie will give you another velvet suit," and she\r\nembraced the child with all her strength, and covered him with kisses.\r\n\r\n"But why can\'t I wear that velvet suit, and why can\'t father come back?\r\nWhy don\'t you like father? You shouldn\'t be cross with father because he\r\ngave me the boat. He didn\'t mean no harm."\r\n\r\n"I think you like your father. You like him better than me."\r\n\r\n"Not better than you, mummie."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t like to have any other father except your own real father?"\r\n\r\n"How could I have a father that wasn\'t my own real father?"\r\n\r\nEsther did not press the point, and soon after Jackie began to talk about\r\nthe possibility of mending his boat; and feeling that something\r\nirrevocable had happened, Esther put on her hat and jacket, and Mrs. Lewis\r\nand Jackie accompanied her to the station. The women kissed each other on\r\nthe platform and were reconciled, but there was a vague sensation of\r\nsadness in the leave-taking which they did not understand. And Esther sat\r\nalone in a third-class carriage absorbed in consideration of the problem\r\nof her life. The life she had dreamed would never be hers--somehow she\r\nseemed to know that she would never be Fred\'s wife. Everything seemed to\r\npoint to the inevitableness of this end.\r\n\r\nShe had determined to see William no more, but he wrote asking how she\r\nwould like him to contribute towards the maintenance of the child, and\r\nthis could not be settled without personal interviews. Miss Rice and Mrs.\r\nLewis seemed to take it for granted that she would marry William when he\r\nobtained his divorce. He was applying himself to the solution of this\r\ndifficulty, and professed himself to be perfectly satisfied with the\r\ncourse that events were taking. And whenever she saw Jackie he inquired\r\nafter his father; he hoped, too, that she had forgiven poor father, who\r\nhad never meant no harm at all. Day by day she saw more clearly that her\r\ninstinct was right in warning her not to let the child see William, that\r\nshe had done wrong in allowing her feelings to be overruled by Miss Rice,\r\nwho had, of course, advised her for the best. But it was clear to her now\r\nthat Jackie never would take kindly to Fred as a stepfather; that he would\r\nnever forgive her if she divided him from his real father by marrying\r\nanother man. He would grow to dislike his stepfather more and more; and\r\nwhen he grew older he would keep away from the house on account of the\r\npresence of his stepfather; it would end by his going to live with him. He\r\nwould be led into a life of betting and drinking; she would lose her child\r\nif she married Fred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one evening as she was putting things away in the kitchen before\r\ngoing up to bed that she heard some one rap at the window. Could this be\r\nFred? Her heart was beating; she must let him in. The area was in\r\ndarkness; she could see no one.\r\n\r\n"Who is there?" she cried.\r\n\r\n"It\'s only me. I had to see you to-night on----"\r\n\r\nShe drew an easier breath, and asked him to come in.\r\n\r\nWilliam had expected a rougher reception. The tone in which Esther invited\r\nhim in was almost genial, and there was no need of so many excuses; but he\r\nhad come prepared with excuses, and a few ran off his tongue before he was\r\naware.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Esther, "it is rather late. I was just going up to bed; but\r\nyou can tell me what you\'ve come about, if it won\'t take long."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t take long.... I\'ve seen my solicitor this afternoon, and he says\r\nthat I shall find it very difficult to get a divorce."\r\n\r\n"So you can\'t get your divorce?"\r\n\r\n"Are you glad?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? You must be either glad or sorry."\r\n\r\n"I said what I mean. I am not given to telling lies." Esther set the large\r\ntin candlestick, on which a wick was spluttering, on the kitchen table,\r\nand William looked at her inquiringly. She was always a bit of a mystery\r\nto him. And then he told her, speaking very quickly, how he had neglected\r\nto secure proofs of his wife\'s infidelity at the time; and as she had\r\nlived a circumspect although a guilty life ever since, the solicitor\r\nthought that it would be difficult to establish a case against her.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she never was guilty," said Esther, unable to resist the\r\ntemptation to irritate.\r\n\r\n"Not guilty! what do you mean? Haven\'t I told you how I found them the day\r\nI came up from Ascot?... And didn\'t she own up to it? What more proof do\r\nyou want?"\r\n\r\n"Anyway, it appears you haven\'t enough; what are you going to do? Wait\r\nuntil you catch her out?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing else to do, unless----" William paused, and his eyes\r\nwandered from Esther\'s.\r\n\r\n"Unless what?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you see my solicitors have been in communication with her\r\nsolicitors, and her solicitors say that if it were the other way round,\r\nthat if I gave her reason to go against me for a divorce, she would be\r\nglad of the chance. That\'s all they said at first, but since then I\'ve\r\nseen my wife, and she says that if I\'ll give her cause to get a divorce\r\nshe\'ll not only go for it, but will pay all the legal expenses; it won\'t\r\ncost us a penny. What do you think Esther?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I understand. You don\'t mean----"\r\n\r\n"You see, Esther, that to get a divorce--there\'s no one who can hear us,\r\nis there?"\r\n\r\n"No, there\'s no one in the \'ouse except me and the missus, and she\'s in\r\nthe study reading. Go on."\r\n\r\n"It seems that one of the parties must go and live with another party\r\nbefore either can get a divorce. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that you want me to go and live with you, and perhaps get\r\nleft a second time?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all rot, Esther, and you knows it."\r\n\r\n"If that\'s all you\'ve got to say to me you\'d better take your hook."\r\n\r\n"Do you see, there\'s the child to consider? And you know well enough,\r\nEsther, that you\'ve nothing to fear; you knows as well as can be that I\r\nmean to run straight this time. So I did before. But let bygones be\r\nbygones, and I know you\'d like the child to have a father; so if only for\r\nhis sake----"\r\n\r\n"For his sake! I like that; as if I hadn\'t done enough for him. Haven\'t I\r\nworked and slaved myself to death and gone about in rags? That\'s what that\r\nchild has cost me. Tell me what he\'s cost you. Not a penny piece--a toy\r\nboat and a suit of velveteen knickerbockers,--and yet you come telling\r\nme--I\'d like to know what\'s expected of me. Is a woman never to think of\r\nherself? Do I count for nothing? For the child\'s sake, indeed! Now, if it\r\nwas anyone else but you. Just tell me where do I come in? That\'s what I\r\nwant to know. I\'ve played the game long enough. Where do I come in? That\'s\r\nwhat I want to know."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no use flying in a passion, Esther. I know you\'ve had a hard\r\ntime. I know it was all very unlucky from the very first. But there\'s no\r\nuse saying that you might get left a second time, for you know well enough\r\nthat that ain\'t true. Say you won\'t do it; you\'re a free woman, you can\r\nact as you please. It would be unjust to ask you to give up anything more\r\nfor the child; I agree with you in all that. But don\'t fly in a rage with\r\nme because I came to tell you there was no other way out of the\r\ndifficulty."\r\n\r\n"You can go and live with another woman, and get a divorce that way."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can do that; but I first thought I\'d speak to you on the subject.\r\nFor if I did go and live with another woman I couldn\'t very well desert\r\nher after getting a divorce."\r\n\r\n"You deserted me."\r\n\r\n"Why go back on that old story?"\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t an old story, it\'s the story of my life, and I haven\'t come to\r\nthe end of it yet."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll have got to the end of it if you\'ll do what I say."\r\n\r\nA moment later Esther said--\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you want to get a divorce for at all. I daresay your\r\nwife would take you back if you were to ask her."\r\n\r\n"She\'s no children, and never will have none, and marriage is a poor\r\nlook-out without children--all the worry and anxiety for nothing. What do\r\nwe marry for but children? There\'s no other happiness. I\'ve tried\r\neverything else--"\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t."\r\n\r\n"I know all that. I know you\'ve had a damned hard time, Esther. I\'ve had a\r\ngood week at Doncaster, and have enough money to buy my partner out; we\r\nshall \'ave the \'ouse to ourselves, and, working together, I don\'t think\r\nwe\'ll \'ave much difficulty in building it up into a very nice property,\r\nall of which will in time go to the boy. I\'m doing pretty well, I told\r\nyou, in the betting line, but if you like I\'ll give it up. I\'ll never lay\r\nor take the odds again. I can\'t say more, Esther, can I? Come, say yes,"\r\nhe said, reaching his arm towards her.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t touch me," she said surlily, and drew back a step with air of\r\nresolution that made him doubt if he would be able to persuade her.\r\n\r\n"Now, Esther----" William did not finish. It seemed useless to argue with\r\nher, and he looked at the great red ash of the tallow candle.\r\n\r\n"You are the mother of my boy, so it is different; but to advise me to go\r\nand live with another woman! I shouldn\'t have thought it of a religious\r\ngirl like you."\r\n\r\n"Religion! There\'s very little time for religion in the places I\'ve had to\r\nwork in." Then, thinking of Fred, she added that she had returned to\r\nChrist, and hoped He would forgive her. William encouraged her to speak of\r\nherself, remarking that, chapel or no chapel, she seemed just as severe\r\nand particular as ever. "If you won\'t, I can only say I am sorry; but that\r\nshan\'t prevent me from paying you as much a week as you think necessary\r\nfor Jack\'s keep and his schooling. I don\'t want the boy to cost you\r\nanything. I\'d like to do a great deal more for the boy, but I can\'t do\r\nmore unless you make him my child."\r\n\r\n"And I can only do that by going away to live with you?" The words brought\r\nan instinctive look of desire into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"In six months we shall be man and wife.... Say yes."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t... I can\'t, don\'t ask me."\r\n\r\n"You\'re afraid to trust me, is that it?"\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer.\r\n\r\n"I can make that all right: I\'ll settle L500 on you and the child."\r\n\r\nShe looked up; the same look was in her eyes, only modified, softened by\r\nsome feeling of tenderness which had come into her heart.\r\n\r\nHe put his arm round her; she was leaning against the table; he was\r\nsitting on the edge.\r\n\r\n"You know that I mean to act rightly by you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think you do."\r\n\r\n"Then say yes."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t--it is too late."\r\n\r\n"There\'s another chap?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n"I thought as much. Do you care for him?"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer.\r\n\r\nHe drew her closer to him; she did not resist; he could see that she was\r\nweeping. He kissed her on her neck first, and then on her face; and he\r\ncontinued to ask her if she loved the other chap. At last she signified\r\nthat she did not.\r\n\r\n"Then say yes." She murmured that she could not. "You can, you can, you\r\ncan." He kissed her, all the while reiterating, "You can, you can, you\r\ncan," until it became a sort of parrot cry. Several minutes elapsed, and\r\nthe candle began to splutter in its socket. She said--\r\n\r\n"Let me go; let me light the gas."\r\n\r\nAs she sought for the matches she caught sight of the clock.\r\n\r\n"I did not know it was so late."\r\n\r\n"Say yes before I go."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t."\r\n\r\nAnd it was impossible to extort a promise from her. "I\'m too tired," she\r\nsaid, "let me go."\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms and kissed her, and said, "My own little wife."\r\n\r\nAs he went up the area steps she remembered that he had used the same\r\nwords before. She tried to think of Fred, but William\'s great square\r\nshoulders had come between her and this meagre little man. She sighed, and\r\nfelt once again that her will was overborne by a force which she could not\r\ncontrol or understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nShe went round the house bolting and locking the doors, seeing that\r\neverything was made fast for the night. At the foot of the stairs painful\r\nthoughts came upon her, and she drew her hand across her eyes; for she was\r\nwhelmed with a sense of sorrow, of purely mental misery, which she could\r\nnot understand, and which she had not strength to grapple with. She was,\r\nhowever, conscious of the fact that life was proving too strong for her,\r\nthat she could make nothing of it, and she thought that she did not care\r\nmuch what happened. She had fought with adverse fate, and had conquered in\r\na way; she had won countless victories over herself, and now found herself\r\nwithout the necessary strength for the last battle; she had not even\r\nstrength for blame, and merely wondered why she had let William kiss her.\r\nShe remembered how she had hated him, and now she hated him no longer. She\r\nought not to have spoken to him; above all, she ought not to have taken\r\nhim to see the child. But how could she help it?\r\n\r\nShe slept on the same landing as Miss Rice, and was moved by a sudden\r\nimpulse to go in and tell her the story of her trouble. But what good? No\r\none could help her. She liked Fred; they seemed to suit each other, and\r\nshe could have made him a good wife if she had not met William. She\r\nthought of the cottage at Mortlake, and their lives in it; and she sought\r\nto stimulate her liking for him with thoughts of the meeting-house; she\r\nthought even of the simple black dress she would wear, and that life\r\nseemed so natural to her that she did not understand why she hesitated....\r\nIf she were to marry William she would go to the "King\'s Head."\r\n\r\nShe would stand behind the bar; she would serve the customers. She had\r\nnever seen much life, and felt somehow that she would like to see a little\r\nlife; there would not be much life in the cottage at Mortlake; nothing but\r\nthe prayer-meeting. She stopped thinking, surprised at her thoughts. She\r\nhad never thought like that before; it seemed as if some other woman whom\r\nshe hardly knew was thinking for her. She seemed like one standing at\r\ncross-roads, unable to decide which road she would take. If she took the\r\nroad leading to the cottage and the prayer-meeting her life would\r\nhenceforth be secure. She could see her life from end to end, even to the\r\ntime when Fred would come and sit by her, and hold her hand as she had\r\nseen his father and mother sitting side by side. If she took the road to\r\nthe public-house and the race-course she did not know what might not\r\nhappen. But William had promised to settle L500 on her and Jackie. Her\r\nlife would be secure either way.\r\n\r\nShe must marry Fred; she had promised to marry him; she wished to be a\r\ngood woman; he would give her the life she was most fitted for, the life\r\nshe had always desired; the life of her father and mother, the life of her\r\nchildhood. She would marry Fred, only--something at that moment seemed to\r\ntake her by the throat. William had come between her and that life. If she\r\nhad not met him at Woodview long ago; if she had not met him in the\r\nPembroke Road that night she went to fetch the beer for her mistress\'s\r\ndinner, how different everything would have been! ...If she had met him\r\nonly a few months later, when she was Fred\'s wife!\r\n\r\nWishing she might go to sleep, and awake the wife of one or the other, she\r\nfell asleep to dream of a husband possessed of the qualities of both, and\r\na life that was neither all chapel nor all public-house. But soon the one\r\nbecame two, and Esther awoke in terror, believing she had married them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Fred had said, "Come away with me," Esther would have obeyed the\r\nelemental romanticism which is so fixed a principle in woman\'s nature. But\r\nwhen she called at the shop he only spoke of his holiday, of the long\r\nwalks he had taken, and the religious and political meetings he had\r\nattended. Esther listened vaguely; and there was in her mind unconscious\r\nregret that he was not a little different. Little irrelevant thoughts came\r\nupon her. She would like him better if he wore coloured neckties and a\r\nshort jacket; she wished half of him away--his dowdiness, his\r\nsandy-coloured hair, the vague eyes, the black neckties, the long loose\r\nfrock-coat. But his voice was keen and ringing, and when listening her\r\nheart always went out to him, and she felt that she might fearlessly\r\nentrust her life to him. But he did not seem wholly to understand her, and\r\nday by day, against her will, the thought gripped her more and more\r\nclosely that she could not separate Jackie from his father. She would have\r\nto tell Fred the whole truth, and he would not understand it; that she\r\nknew. But it would have to be done, and she sent round to say she\'d like\r\nto see him when he left business. Would he step round about eight o\'clock?\r\n\r\nThe clock had hardly struck eight when she heard a tap at the window. She\r\nopened the door and he came in, surprised by the silence with which she\r\nreceived him.\r\n\r\n"I hope nothing has happened. Is anything the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a great deal\'s the matter. I\'m afraid we shall never be married,\r\nFred, that\'s what\'s the matter."\r\n\r\n"How\'s that, Esther? What can prevent us getting married?" She did not\r\nanswer, and then he said, "You\'ve not ceased to care for me?"\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s not it."\r\n\r\n"Jackie\'s father has come back?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve hit it, that\'s what happened."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry that man has come across you again. I thought you told me he\r\nwas married. But, Esther, don\'t keep me in suspense; what has he done?"\r\n\r\n"Sit down; don\'t stand staring at me in that way, and I\'ll tell you the\r\nstory."\r\n\r\nThen in a strained voice, in which there was genuine suffering, Esther\r\ntold her story, laying special stress on the fact that she had done her\r\nbest to prevent him from seeing the child.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how you could have forbidden him access to the child."\r\n\r\nHe often used words that Esther did not understand, but guessing his\r\nmeaning, she answered--\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what the missus said; she argued me into taking him to see\r\nthe child. I knew once he\'d seen Jackie there\'d be no getting rid of him.\r\nI shall never get rid of him again."\r\n\r\n"He has no claim upon you. It is just like him, low blackguard fellow that\r\nhe is, to come after you, persecuting you. But don\'t you fear; you leave\r\nhim to me. I\'ll find a way of stopping his little game."\r\n\r\nEsther looked at his frail figure.\r\n\r\n"You can do nothing; no one can do nothing," she said, and the tears\r\ntrembled in her handsome eyes. "He wants me to go away and live with him,\r\nso that his wife may be able to divorce him."\r\n\r\n"Wants you to go away and live with him! But surely, Esther, you do\r\nnot----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he wants me to go and live with him, so that his wife can get a\r\ndivorce," Esther answered, for the suspense irritated her; "and how can I\r\nrefuse to go with him?"\r\n\r\n"Esther, are you serious? You cannot... You told me that you did not love\r\nhim, and after all----" He waited for Esther to speak.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said very quickly, "there is no way out of it that I can see."\r\n\r\n"Esther, that man has tempted you, and you have not prayed."\r\n\r\nShe did not answer.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to hear more of this," he said, catching up his hat. "I\r\nshouldn\'t have believed it if I had not heard it from your lips; no, not\r\nif the whole world had told me. You are in love with this man, though you\r\nmay not know it, and you\'ve invented this story as a pretext to throw me\r\nover. Good-bye, Esther."\r\n\r\n"Fred, dear, listen, hear me out. You\'ll not go away in that hasty way.\r\nYou\'re the only friend I have. Let me explain."\r\n\r\n"Explain! how can such things be explained?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I thought until all this happened to me. I have suffered\r\ndreadful in the last few days. I\'ve wept bitter tears, and I thought of\r\nall you said about the \'ome you was going to give me." Her sincerity was\r\nunmistakable, and Fred doubted her no longer. "I\'m very fond of you, Fred,\r\nand if things had been different I think I might have made you a good\r\nwife. But it wasn\'t to be."\r\n\r\n"Esther, I don\'t understand. You need never see this man again if you\r\ndon\'t wish it."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay, things ain\'t so easily changed as all that. He\'s the father of\r\nmy child, he\'s got money, and he\'ll leave his money to his child if he\'s\r\nmade Jackie\'s father in the eyes of the law."\r\n\r\n"That can be done without your going to live with him."\r\n\r\n"Not as he wants. I know what he wants; he wants a \'ome, and he won\'t be\r\nput off with less."\r\n\r\n"How men can be so wicked as----"\r\n\r\n"No, you do him wrong. He ain\'t no more wicked than another; he\'s just one\r\nof the ordinary sort--not much better or worse. If he\'d been a real bad\r\nlot it would have been better for us, for then he\'d never have come\r\nbetween us. You\'re beginning to understand, Fred, ain\'t you? If I don\'t go\r\nwith him my boy\'ll lose everything. He wants a \'ome--a real \'ome with\r\nchildren, and if he can\'t get me he\'ll go after another woman."\r\n\r\n"And are you jealous?"\r\n\r\n"No, Fred. But think if we was to marry. As like as not I should have\r\nchildren, and they\'d be more in your sight than my boy."\r\n\r\n"Esther, I promise that----"\r\n\r\n"Just so, Fred; even if you loved him like your own, you can\'t make sure\r\nthat he\'d love you."\r\n\r\n"Jackie and I----"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; he\'d have liked you well enough if he\'d never seen his father.\r\nBut he\'s that keen on his father, and it would be worse later on. He\'d\r\nnever be contented in our \'ome. He\'d be always after him, and then I\r\nshould never see him, and he would be led away into betting and drink."\r\n\r\n"If his father is that sort of man, the best chance for Jackie would be to\r\nkeep him out of his way. If he gets divorced and marries another woman he\r\nwill forget all about Jackie."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that might be," said Esther, and Fred pursued his advantage. But,\r\ninterrupting him, Esther said--\r\n\r\n"Anyway, Jackie would lose all his father\'s money; the public-house\r\nwould--"\r\n\r\n"So you\'re going to live in a public-house, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"A woman must be with her husband."\r\n\r\n"But he\'s not your husband; he\'s another woman\'s husband."\r\n\r\n"He\'s to marry me when he gets his divorce."\r\n\r\n"He may desert you and leave you with another child."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t say nothing I ain\'t thought of already. I must put up with the\r\nrisk. I suppose it is a part of the punishment for the first sin. We can\'t\r\ndo wrong without being punished--at least women can\'t. But I thought I\'d\r\nbeen punished enough."\r\n\r\n"The second sin is worse than the first. A married man, Esther--you who I\r\nthought so religious."\r\n\r\n"Ah, religion is easy enough at times, but there is other times when it\r\ndon\'t seem to fit in with one\'s duty. I may be wrong, but it seems natural\r\nlike--he\'s the father of my child."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid your mind is made up, Esther. Think twice before it\'s too\r\nlate."\r\n\r\n"Fred, I can\'t help myself--can\'t you see that? Don\'t make it harder for\r\nme by talking like that."\r\n\r\n"When are you going to him?"\r\n\r\n"To-night; he\'s waiting for me."\r\n\r\n"Then good-bye, Esther, good--"\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll come and see us."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll be happy, Esther, but I don\'t think we shall see much more\r\nof each other. You know that I do not frequent public-houses."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know; but you might come and see me in the morning when we\'re\r\ndoing no business."\r\n\r\nFred smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n"Then you won\'t come?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Esther."\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, and he went out hurriedly. She dashed a tear from her\r\neyes, and went upstairs to her mistress, who had rung for her.\r\n\r\nMiss Rice was in her easy-chair, reading. A long, slanting ray entered the\r\nroom; the bead curtain glittered, and so peaceful was the impression that\r\nEsther could not but perceive the contrast between her own troublous life\r\nand the contented privacy of this slender little spinster\'s.\r\n\r\n"Well, miss," she said, "it\'s all over. I\'ve told him."\r\n\r\n"Have you, Esther?" said Miss Rice. Her white, delicate hands fell over\r\nthe closed volume. She wore two little colourless rings and a ruby ring\r\nwhich caught the light.\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, I\'ve told him all. He seemed a good deal cut up. I couldn\'t\r\nhelp crying myself, for I could have made him a good wife--I\'m sure I\r\ncould; but it wasn\'t to be."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve told him you were going off to live with William?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss; there\'s nothing like telling the whole truth while you\'re\r\nabout it. I told him I was going off to-night."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a very religious young man?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss; he spoke to me about religion, but I told him I didn\'t want\r\nJackie to be a fatherless boy, and to lose any money he might have a right\r\nto. It don\'t look right to go and live with a married man; but you knows,\r\nmiss, how I\'m situated, and you knows that I\'m only doing it because it\r\nseems for the best."\r\n\r\n"What did he say to that?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing much, miss, except that I might get left a second time--and, he\r\nwasn\'t slow to add, with another child."\r\n\r\n"Have you thought of that danger, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, I\'ve thought of everything; but thinking don\'t change nothing.\r\nThings remain just the same, and you\'ve to chance it in the end--leastways\r\na woman has. Not on the likes of you, miss, but the likes of us."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss Rice reflectively, "it is always the woman who is\r\nsacrificed." And her thought went back for a moment to the novel she was\r\nwriting. It seemed to her pale and conventional compared with this rough\r\npage torn out of life. She wondered if she could treat the subject. She\r\npassed in review the names of some writers who could do justice to it, and\r\nthen her eyes went from her bookcase to Esther.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re going to live in a public-house, Esther? You\'re going to-night?\r\nI\'ve paid you everything I owe you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, you have; you\'ve been very kind to me, indeed you have,\r\nmiss--I shall never forget you, miss. I\'ve been very happy in your\r\nservice, and should like nothing better than to remain on with you."\r\n\r\n"All I can say, Esther, is that you have been a very good servant, and I\'m\r\nvery sorry to part with you. And I hope you\'ll remember if things do not\r\nturn out as well as you expect them to, that I shall always be glad to do\r\nanything in my power to help you. You\'ll always find a friend in me. When\r\nare you going?"\r\n\r\n"As soon as my box is packed, miss, and I shall have about finished by the\r\ntime the new servant comes in. She\'s expected at nine; there she is,\r\nmiss--that\'s the area bell. Good-bye, miss."\r\n\r\nMiss Rice involuntarily held out her hand. Esther took it, and thus\r\nencouraged she said--\r\n\r\n"There never was anyone that clear-headed and warm-hearted as yerself,\r\nmiss. I may have a lot of trouble, miss.... If I wasn\'t yer servant I\'d\r\nlike to kiss you."\r\n\r\nMiss Rice did not answer, and before she was aware, Esther had taken her\r\nin her arms and kissed her. "You\'re not angry with me, miss; I couldn\'t\r\nhelp myself."\r\n\r\n"No, Esther, I\'m not angry."\r\n\r\n"I must go now and let her in."\r\n\r\nMiss Rice walked towards her writing-table, and a sense of the solitude of\r\nher life coming upon her suddenly caused her to burst into tears. It was\r\none of those moments of effusion which take women unawares. But her new\r\nservant was coming upstairs and she had to dry her eyes.\r\n\r\nSoon after she heard the cabman\'s feet on the staircase as he went up for\r\nEsther\'s box. They brought it down together, and Miss Rice heard her beg\r\nof him to be careful of the paint. The girl had been a good and faithful\r\nservant to her; she was sorry to lose her. And Esther was equally sorry\r\nthat anyone but herself should have the looking after of that dear, kind\r\nsoul. But what could she do? She was going to be married. She did not\r\ndoubt that William was going to marry her; and the cab had hardly entered\r\nthe Brompton Road when her thoughts were fully centred in the life that\r\nawaited her. This sudden change of feeling surprised her, and she excused\r\nherself with the recollection that she had striven hard for Fred, but as\r\nshe had failed to get him, it was only right that she should think of her\r\nhusband. Then quite involuntarily the thought sprang upon her that he was\r\na fine fellow, and she remembered the line of his stalwart figure as he\r\nwalked down the street. There would be a parlour behind the bar, in which\r\nshe would sit. She would be mistress of the house. There would be a\r\nservant, a potboy, and perhaps a barmaid.\r\n\r\nThe cab swerved round the Circus, and she wondered if she were capable of\r\nconducting a business like the "King\'s Head."\r\n\r\nIt was the end of a fine September evening, and the black, crooked\r\nperspectives of Soho seemed as if they were roofed with gold. A slight\r\nmist was rising, and at the end of every street the figures appeared and\r\ndisappeared mysteriously in blue shadow. She had never been in this part\r\nof London before; the adventure stimulated her imagination, and she\r\nwondered where she was going and which of the many public-houses was hers.\r\nBut the cabman jingled past every one. It seemed as if he were never going\r\nto pull up. At last he stopped at the corner of Dean Street and Old\r\nCompton Street, nearly opposite a cab rank. The cabmen were inside, having\r\na glass; the usual vagrant was outside, looking after the horses. He\r\noffered to take down Esther\'s box, and when she asked him if he had seen\r\nMr. Latch he took her round to the private bar. The door was pushed open,\r\nand Esther saw William leaning over the counter wrapped in conversation\r\nwith a small, thin man. They were both smoking, their glasses were filled,\r\nand the sporting paper was spread out before them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, so here you are at last," said William, coming towards her. "I\r\nexpected you an hour ago."\r\n\r\n"The new servant was late, and I couldn\'t leave before she came."\r\n\r\n"Never mind; glad you\'ve come."\r\n\r\nEsther felt that the little man was staring hard at her. He was John\r\nRandal, or Mr. Leopold, as they used to call him at Barfield.\r\n\r\nMr. Leopold shook hands with Esther, and he muttered a "Glad to see you\r\nagain," But it was the welcome of a man who regards a woman\'s presence as\r\nan intrusion, and Esther understood the quiet contempt with which he\r\nlooked at William. "Can\'t keep away from them," his face said for one\r\nbrief moment. William asked Esther what she\'d take to drink, and Mr.\r\nLeopold looked at his watch and said he must be getting home.\r\n\r\n"Try to come round to-morrow night if you\'ve an hour to spare."\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t think you\'ll go to Newmarket?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think I shall do much in the betting way this year. But come\r\nround to-morrow night if you can; you\'ll find me here. I must be here\r\nto-morrow night," he said, turning to Esther; "I\'ll tell you presently."\r\nThen the men had a few more words, and William bade John good-night.\r\nComing back to Esther, he said--\r\n\r\n"What do you think of the place? Cosy, ain\'t it?" But before she had time\r\nto reply he said, "You\'ve brought me good luck. I won two \'undred and\r\nfifty pounds to-day, and the money will come in very \'andy, for Jim\r\nStevens, that\'s my partner, has agreed to take half the money on account\r\nand a bill of sale for the rest. There he is; I\'ll introduce you to him.\r\nJim, come this way, will you?"\r\n\r\n"In a moment, when I\'ve finished drawing this \'ere glass of beer,"\r\nanswered a thick-set, short-limbed man. He was in his shirt-sleeves, and\r\nhe crossed the bar wiping the beer from his hands.\r\n\r\n"Let me introduce you to a very particular friend of mine, Jim, Miss\r\nWaters."\r\n\r\n"Very \'appy, I\'m sure, to make your acquaintance," said Jim, and he\r\nextended his fat hand across the counter. "You and my partner are, I \'ear,\r\ngoing to take this \'ere \'ouse off my hands. Well, you ought to make a good\r\nthing of it. There\'s always room for a \'ouse that supplies good liquor.\r\nWhat can I hoffer you, madam? Some of our whisky has been fourteen years\r\nin bottle; or, being a lady, perhaps you\'d like to try some of our best\r\nunsweetened."\r\n\r\nEsther declined, but William said they could not leave without drinking\r\nthe health of the house.\r\n\r\n"Irish or Scotch, ma\'am? Mr. Latch drinks Scotch."\r\n\r\nSeeing that she could not avoid taking something, Esther decided that she\r\nwould try the unsweetened. The glasses were clinked across the counter,\r\nand William whispered, "This isn\'t what we sell to the public; this is our\r\nown special tipple. You didn\'t notice, perhaps, but he took the bottle\r\nfrom the third row on the left."\r\n\r\nAt that moment Esther\'s cabman came in and wanted to know if he was to\r\nhave the box taken down. William said it had better remain where it was.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I told you I\'m not living here; my partner has the upper\r\npart of the house, but he says he\'ll be ready to turn out at the end of\r\nthe week. I\'m living in lodgings near Shaftesbury Avenue, so we\'d better\r\nkeep the cab on."\r\n\r\nEsther looked disappointed, but said nothing. William said he\'d stand the\r\ncabby a drink, and, winking at Esther, he whispered, "Third row on the\r\nleft, partner."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe "King\'s Head" was an humble place in the old-fashioned style. The\r\nhouse must have been built two hundred years, and the bar seemed as if it\r\nhad been dug out of the house. The floor was some inches lower than the\r\nstreet, and the ceiling was hardly more than a couple of feet above the\r\nhead of a tall man. Nor was it divided by numerous varnished partitions,\r\naccording to the latest fashion. There were but three. The private\r\nentrance was in Dean Street, where a few swells came over from the theatre\r\nand called for brandies-and-sodas. There was a little mahogany what-not on\r\nthe counter, and Esther served her customers between the little shelves.\r\nThe public entrance and the jug and bottle entrance were in a side street.\r\nThere was no parlour for special customers at the back, and the public bar\r\nwas inconveniently crowded by a dozen people. The "King\'s Head" was not an\r\nup-to-date public-house. It had, however, one thing in its favour--it was\r\na free house, and William said they had only to go on supplying good\r\nstuff, and trade would be sure to come back to them. For their former\r\npartner had done them much harm by systematic adulteration, and a little\r\nway down the street a new establishment, with painted tiles and brass\r\nlamps, had been opened, and was attracting all the custom of the\r\nneighbourhood. She was more anxious than William to know what loss the\r\nbooks showed; she was jealous of the profits of his turf account, and when\r\nhe laughed at her she said, "But you\'re never here in the daytime, you do\r\nnot have these empty bars staring you in the face morning and afternoon."\r\nAnd then she would tell him: a dozen pots of beer about dinner-time, a few\r\nglasses of bitter--there had been a rehearsal over the way--and that was\r\nabout all.\r\n\r\nThe bars were empty, and the public-house dozed through the heavy heat of\r\na summer afternoon. Esther sat behind the bar sewing, waiting for Jackie\r\nto come home from school. William was away at Newmarket. The clock struck\r\nfive and Jackie peeped through the doors, dived under the counter, and ran\r\ninto his mother\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"Well, did you get full marks to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mummie, I got full marks."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good boy--and you want your tea?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mummie; I\'m that hungry I could hardly walk home."\r\n\r\n"Hardly walk home! What, as bad as that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mummie. There\'s a new shop open in Oxford Street. The window is all\r\nfull of boats. Do you think that if all the favourites were to be beaten\r\nfor a month, father would buy me one?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you was so hungry you couldn\'t walk home, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Well, mummie, so I was, but----"\r\n\r\nEsther laughed. "Well, come this way and have your tea." She went into the\r\nparlour and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n"Mummie, may I have buttered toast?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, you may."\r\n\r\n"And may I go downstairs and help Jane to make it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you can do that too; it will save her the trouble of coming up. Let\r\nme take off your coat--give me your hat; now run along, and help Jane to\r\nmake the toast."\r\n\r\nEsther opened a glass door, curtained with red silk; it led from the bar\r\nto the parlour, a tiny room, hardly larger than the private bar, holding\r\nwith difficulty a small round table, three chairs, an arm-chair, a\r\ncupboard. In the morning a dusty window let in a melancholy twilight, but\r\nearly in the afternoon it became necessary to light the gas. Esther took a\r\ncloth from the cupboard, and laid the table for Jackie\'s tea. He came up\r\nthe kitchen stairs telling Jane how many marbles he had won, and at that\r\nmoment voices were heard in the bar.\r\n\r\nIt was William, tall and gaunt, buttoned up in a grey frock-coat, a pair\r\nof field glasses slung over his shoulders. He was with his clerk, Ted\r\nBlamy, a feeble, wizen little man, dressed in a shabby tweed suit, covered\r\nwith white dust.\r\n\r\n"Put that bag down, Teddy, and come and have a drink."\r\n\r\nEsther saw at once that things had not gone well with him.\r\n\r\n"Have the favourites been winning?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, every bloody one. Five first favourites straight off the reel, three\r\nyesterday, and two second favourites the day before. By God, no man can\r\nstand up against it. Come, what\'ll you have to drink, Teddy?"\r\n\r\n"A little whisky, please, guv\'nor."\r\n\r\nThe men had their drink. Then William told Teddy to take his bag upstairs,\r\nand he followed Esther into the parlour. She could see that he had been\r\nlosing heavily, but she refrained from asking questions.\r\n\r\n"Now, Jackie, you keep your father company; tell him how you got on at\r\nschool. I\'m going downstairs to look after his dinner."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you mind about my dinner, Esther, don\'t you trouble; I was thinking\r\nof dining at a restaurant. I\'ll be back at nine."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll see nothing of you. We\'ve hardly spoken to one another this\r\nweek; all the day you\'re away racing, and in the evening you\'re talking to\r\nyour friends over the bar. We never have a moment alone."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Esther, I know; but the truth is, I\'m a bit down in the mouth. I\'ve\r\nhad a very bad week. The favourites has been winning, and I overlaid my\r\nbook against Wheatear; I\'d heard that she was as safe as \'ouses. I\'ll meet\r\nsome pals down at the \'Cri\'; it will cheer me up."\r\n\r\nSeeing how disappointed she was, he hesitated, and asked what there was\r\nfor dinner. "A sole and a nice piece of steak; I\'m sure you\'ll like it.\r\nI\'ve a lot to talk to you about. Do stop, Bill, to please me." She was\r\nvery winning in her quiet, grave way, so he took her in his arms, kissed\r\nher, and said he would stop, that no one could cook a sole as she could,\r\nthat it gave him an appetite to think of it.\r\n\r\n"And may I stop with father while you are cooking his dinner?" said\r\nJackie.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you can do that; but you must go to bed when I bring it upstairs. I\r\nwant to talk with father then."\r\n\r\nJackie seemed quite satisfied with this arrangement, but when Esther came\r\nupstairs with the sole, and was about to hand him over to Jane, he begged\r\nlustily to be allowed to remain until father had finished his fish. "It\r\nwon\'t matter to you," he said; "you\'ve to go downstairs to fry the steak."\r\n\r\nBut when she came up with the steak he was unwilling as ever to leave. She\r\nsaid he must go to bed, and he knew from her tone that argument was\r\nuseless. As a last consolation, she promised him that she would come\r\nupstairs and kiss him before he went to sleep.\r\n\r\n"You will come, won\'t you, mummie? I shan\'t go to sleep till you do."\r\nEsther and William both laughed, and Esther was pleased, for she was still\r\na little jealous of his love for his father.\r\n\r\n"Come along," Jackie cried to Jane, and he ran upstairs, chattering to her\r\nabout the toys he had seen in Oxford Street. Charles was lighting the gas,\r\nand Esther had to go into the bar to serve some customers. When she\r\nreturned, William was smoking his pipe. Her dinner had had its effect, he\r\nhad forgotten his losses, and was willing to tell her the news. He had a\r\nbit of news for her. He had seen Ginger; Ginger had come up as cordial as\r\nyou like, and had asked him what price he was laying.\r\n\r\n"Did he bet with you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I laid him ten pounds to five."\r\n\r\nOnce more William began to lament his luck. "You\'ll have better luck\r\nto-morrow," she said. "The favourites can\'t go on winning. Tell me about\r\nGinger."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t much to tell. We\'d a little chat. He knew all about the\r\nlittle arrangement, the five hundred, you know, and laughed heartily.\r\nPeggy\'s married. I\'ve forgotten the chap\'s name."\r\n\r\n"The one that you kicked downstairs?"\r\n\r\n"No, not him; I can\'t think of it. No matter, Ginger remembered you; he\r\nwished us luck, took the address, and said he\'d come in to-night to see\r\nyou if he possibly could. I don\'t think he\'s been doing too well lately,\r\nif he had he\'d been more stand-offish. I saw Jimmy White--you remember\r\nJim, the little fellow we used to call the Demon, \'e that won the\r\nStewards\' Cup on Silver Braid?... Didn\'t you and \'e \'ave a tussle together\r\nat the end of dinner--the first day you come down from town?"\r\n\r\n"The second day it was."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, it was the second day. The first day I met you in the\r\navenue I was leaning over the railings having a smoke, and you come along\r\nwith a heavy bundle and asked me the way. I wasn\'t in service at that\r\ntime. Good Lord, how time does slip by! It seems like yesterday.... And\r\nafter all those years to meet you as you was going to the public for a jug\r\nof beer, and \'ere we are man and wife sitting side by side in our own\r\n\'ouse."\r\n\r\nEsther had been in the "King\'s Head" now nearly a year. The first Mrs.\r\nLatch had got her divorce without much difficulty; and Esther had begun to\r\nrealise that she had got a good husband long before they slipped round to\r\nthe nearest registry office and came back man and wife.\r\n\r\nCharles opened the door. "Mr. Randal is in the bar, sir, and would like to\r\nhave a word with you."\r\n\r\n"All right," said William. "Tell him I\'m coming into the bar presently."\r\nCharles withdrew. "I\'m afraid," said William, lowering his voice, "that\r\nthe old chap is in a bad way. He\'s been out of a place a long while, and\r\nwill find it \'ard to get back again. Once yer begin to age a bit, they\r\nwon\'t look at you. We\'re both well out of business."\r\n\r\nMr. Randal sat in his favourite corner by the wall, smoking his clay. He\r\nwore a large frock-coat, vague in shape, pathetically respectable. The\r\nround hat was greasy round the edges, brown and dusty on top. The shirt\r\nwas clean but unstarched, and the thin throat was tied with an old black\r\nsilk cravat. He looked himself, the old servant out of situation--the old\r\nservant who would never be in situation again.\r\n\r\n"Been \'aving an \'ell of a time at Newmarket," said William; "favourites\r\nromping in one after the other."\r\n\r\n"I saw that the favourites had been winning. But I know of something, a\r\nrank outsider, for the Leger. I got the letter this morning. I thought I\'d\r\ncome round and tell yer."\r\n\r\n"Much obliged, old mate, but it don\'t do for me to listen to such tales;\r\nwe bookmakers must pay no attention to information, no matter how correct\r\nit may be.... Much obliged all the same. What are you drinking?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not finished my glass yet." He tossed off the last mouthful.\r\n\r\n"The same?" said William.\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you."\r\n\r\nWilliam drew two glasses of porter. "Here\'s luck." The men nodded, drank,\r\nand then William turned to speak to a group at the other end of the bar.\r\n"One moment," John said, touching William on the shoulder. "It is the best\r\ntip I ever had in my life. I \'aven\'t forgotten what I owe you, and if this\r\ncomes off I\'ll be able to pay you all back. Lay the odds, twenty\r\nsovereigns to one against--" Old John looked round to see that no one was\r\nwithin ear-shot, then he leant forward and whispered the horse\'s name in\r\nWilliam\'s ear. William laughed. "If you\'re so sure about it as all that,"\r\nhe said, "I\'d sooner lend you the quid to back the horse elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"Will you lend me a quid?"\r\n\r\n"Lend you a quid and five first favourites romping in one after\r\nanother!--you must take me for Baron Rothschild. You think because I\'ve a\r\npublic-house I\'m coining money; well, I ain\'t. It\'s cruel the business we\r\ndo here. You wouldn\'t believe it, and you know that better liquor can\'t be\r\ngot in the neighbourhood." Old John listened with the indifference of a\r\nman whose life is absorbed in one passion and who can interest himself\r\nwith nothing else. Esther asked him after Mrs. Randal and his children,\r\nbut conversation on the subject was always disagreeable to him, and he\r\npassed it over with few words. As soon as Esther moved away he leant\r\nforward and whispered, "Lay me twelve pounds to ten shillings. I\'ll be\r\nsure to pay you; there\'s a new restaurant going to open in Oxford Street\r\nand I\'m going to apply for the place of headwaiter."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but will you get it?" William answered brutally. He did not mean to\r\nbe unkind, but his nature was as hard and as plain as a kitchen-table. The\r\nchin dropped into the unstarched collar and the old-fashioned necktie, and\r\nold John continued smoking unnoticed by any one. Esther looked at him. She\r\nsaw he was down on his luck, and she remembered the tall, melancholy,\r\npale-faced woman whom she had met weeping by the sea-shore the day that\r\nSilver Braid had won the cup. She wondered what had happened to her, in\r\nwhat corner did she live, and where was the son that John Randal had not\r\nallowed to enter the Barfield establishment as page-boy, thinking he would\r\nbe able to make something better of him than a servant.\r\n\r\nThe regular customers had begun to come in. Esther greeted them with nods\r\nand smiles of recognition. She drew the beer two glasses at once in her\r\nhand, and picked up little zinc measures, two and four of whisky, and\r\nfilled them from a small tap. She usually knew the taste of her customers.\r\nWhen she made a mistake she muttered "stupid," and Mr. Ketley was much\r\namused at her forgetting that he always drank out of the bottle; he was\r\none of the few who came to the "King\'s Head" who could afford sixpenny\r\nwhisky. "I ought to have known by this time," she said. "Well, mistakes\r\nwill occur in the best regulated families," the little butterman replied.\r\nHe was meagre and meek, with a sallow complexion and blond beard. His pale\r\neyes were anxious, and his thin, bony hands restless. His general manner\r\nwas oppressed, and he frequently raised his hat to wipe his forehead,\r\nwhich was high and bald. At his elbow stood Journeyman, Ketley\'s very\r\nopposite. A tall, harsh, angular man, long features, a dingy complexion,\r\nand the air of a dismissed soldier. He held a glass of whisky-and-water in\r\na hairy hand, and bit at the corner of a brown moustache. He wore a\r\nthreadbare black frock-coat, and carried a newspaper under his arm. Ketley\r\nand Journeyman held widely different views regarding the best means of\r\nbacking horses. Ketley was preoccupied with dreams and omens; Journeyman,\r\na clerk in the parish registry office, studied public form; he was guided\r\nby it in all his speculations, and paid little heed to the various rumours\r\nalways afloat regarding private trials. Public form he admitted did not\r\nalways come out right, but if a man had a headpiece and could remember all\r\nthe running, public form was good enough to follow. Racing with Journeyman\r\nwas a question of calculation, and great therefore was his contempt for\r\nthe weak and smiling Ketley, whom he went for on all occasions. But Ketley\r\nwas pluckier than his appearance indicated, and the duels between the two\r\nwere a constant source of amusement in the bar of the "King\'s Head."\r\n\r\n"Well, Herbert, the omen wasn\'t altogether up to the mark this time," said\r\nJourneyman, with a malicious twinkle in his small brown eyes.\r\n\r\n"No, it was one of them unfortunate accidents."\r\n\r\n"One of them unfortunate accidents," repeated Journeyman, derisively;\r\n"what\'s accidents to do with them that \'as to do with the reading of\r\nomens? I thought they rose above such trifles as weights, distances, bad\r\nriding.... A stone or two should make no difference if the omen is right."\r\n\r\nKetley was no way put out by the slight titter that Journeyman\'s retort\r\nhad produced in the group about the bar. He drank his whisky-and-water\r\ndeliberately, like one, to use a racing expression, who had been over the\r\ncourse before.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve \'eard that argument. I know all about it, but it don\'t alter me. Too\r\nmany strange things occur for me to think that everything can be\r\ncalculated with a bit of lead-pencil in a greasy pocket-book."\r\n\r\n"What has the grease of my pocket-book to do with it?" replied Journeyman,\r\nlooking round. The company smiled and nodded. "You says that signs and\r\nomens is above any calculation of weights. Never mind the pocket-book,\r\ngreasy or not greasy; you says that these omens is more to be depended on\r\nthan the best stable information."\r\n\r\n"I thought that you placed no reliance on stable information, and that you\r\nwas guided by the weights that you calculated in that \'ere pocket-book."\r\n\r\n"What\'s my pocket-book to do with it? You want to see my pocket-book;\r\nwell, here it is, and I\'ll bet two glasses of beer that it ain\'t greasier\r\nthan any other pocket-book in this bar."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see meself what pocket-books, greasy or not greasy, has to do\r\nwith it," said William. "Walter put a fair question to Herbert. The omen\r\ndidn\'t come out right, and Walter wanted to know why it didn\'t come out\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"That was it," said Journeyman.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were now fixed on Ketley. "You want to know why the omen wasn\'t\r\nright? I\'ll tell you--because it was no omen at all, that\'s why. The omens\r\nalways comes right; it is we who aren\'t always in the particular state of\r\nmind that allows us to read the omens right." Journeyman shrugged his\r\nshoulders contemptuously. Ketley looked at him with the same expression of\r\nplacid amusement. "You\'d like me to explain; well, I will. The omen is\r\nalways right, but we aren\'t always in the state of mind for the reading of\r\nthe omen. You think that ridiculous, Walter; but why should omens differ\r\nfrom other things? Some days we can get through our accounts in \'alf the\r\ntime we can at other times, the mind being clearer. I asks all present if\r\nthat is not so."\r\n\r\nKetley had got hold of his audience, and Journeyman\'s remark about closing\r\ntime only provoked a momentary titter. Ketley looked long and steadily at\r\nJourneyman and then said, "Perhaps closing time won\'t do no more for your\r\ncalculation of weights than for my omens.... I know them jokes, we\'ve\r\n\'eard them afore; but I\'m not making jokes; I\'m talking serious." The\r\ncompany nodded approval. "I was saying there was times when the mind is\r\nfresh like the morning. That\'s the time for them what \'as got the gift of\r\nreading the omens. It is a sudden light that comes into the mind, and it\r\npoints straight like a ray of sunlight, if there be nothing to stop it....\r\nNow do you understand?" No one had understood, but all felt that they were\r\non the point of understanding. "The whole thing is in there being nothing\r\nto interrupt the light."\r\n\r\n"But you says yourself that yer can\'t always read them," said Journeyman;\r\n"an accident will send you off on the wrong tack, so it all comes to the\r\nsame thing, omens or no omens."\r\n\r\n"A man will trip over a piece of wire laid across the street, but that\r\ndon\'t prove he can\'t walk, do it, Walter?"\r\n\r\nWalter was unable to say that it did not, and so Ketley scored another\r\npoint over his opponent. "I made a mistake, I know I did, and if it will\r\nhelp you to understand I\'ll tell you how it was made. Three weeks ago I\r\nwas in this \'ere bar \'aving what I usually takes. It was a bit early; none\r\nof you fellows had come in. I don\'t think it was much after eight. The\r\ngovernor was away in the north racin\'--hadn\'t been \'ome for three or four\r\ndays; the missus was beginning to look a bit lonely." Ketley smiled and\r\nglanced at Esther, who had told Charles to serve some customers, and was\r\nlistening as intently as the rest. "I\'d \'ad a nice bit of supper, and was\r\njust feeling that fresh and clear \'eaded as I was explaining to you just\r\nnow is required for the reading, thinking of nothing in perticler, when\r\nsuddenly the light came. I remembered a conversation I \'ad with a chap\r\nabout American corn. He wouldn\'t \'ear of the Government taxing corn to\r\n\'elp the British farmer. Well, that conversation came back to me as clear\r\nas if the dawn had begun to break. I could positively see the bloody corn;\r\nI could pretty well \'ave counted it. I felt there was an omen about\r\nsomewhere, and all of a tremble I took up the paper; it was lying on the\r\nbar just where your hand is, Walter. But at that moment, just as I was\r\nabout to cast my eye down the list of \'orses, a cab comes down the street\r\nas \'ard as it could tear. There was but two or three of us in the bar, and\r\nwe rushed out--the shafts was broke, \'orse galloping and kicking, and the\r\ncabby \'olding on as \'ard as he could. But it was no good, it was bound to\r\ngo, and over it went against the kerb. The cabby, poor chap, was pretty\r\nwell shook to pieces; his leg was broke, and we\'d to \'elp to take him to\r\nthe hosspital. Now I asks if it was no more than might be expected that I\r\nshould have gone wrong about the omen. Next day, as luck would have it, I\r\nrolled up \'alf a pound of butter in a piece of paper on which \'Cross\r\nRoads\' was written."\r\n\r\n"But if there had been no accident and you \'ad looked down the list of\r\n\'orses, \'ow do yer know that yer would \'ave spotted the winner?"\r\n\r\n"What, not Wheatear, and with all that American corn in my \'ead? Is it\r\nlikely I\'d\'ve missed it?"\r\n\r\nNo one answered, and Ketley drank his whisky in the midst of a most\r\nthoughtful silence. At last one of the group said, and he seemed to\r\nexpress the general mind of the company--\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know if omens be worth a-following of, but I\'m blowed if \'orses\r\nbe worth backing if the omens is again them."\r\n\r\nHis neighbour answered, "And they do come wonderful true occasional. They\r\n\'as \'appened to me, and I daresay to all \'ere present." The company\r\nnodded. "You\'ve noticed how them that knows nothing at all about\r\n\'orses--the less they knows the better their luck--will look down the lot\r\nand spot the winner from pure fancy--the name that catches their eyes as\r\nlikely."\r\n\r\n"There\'s something in it," said a corpulent butcher with huge, pursy,\r\nprominent eyes and a portentous stomach. "I always held with going to\r\nchurch, and I hold still more with going to church since I backed Vanity\r\nfor the Chester Cup. I was a-falling asleep over the sermon, when suddenly\r\nI wakes up hearing, \'Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.\'"\r\n\r\nSeveral similar stories were told, and then various systems for backing\r\nhorses were discussed. "You don\'t believe that no \'orses is pulled?" said\r\nMr. Stack, the porter at Sutherland Mansions, Oxford Street, a large,\r\nbluff man, wearing a dark blue square-cut frock coat with brass buttons. A\r\ncurious-looking man, with red-stained skin, dark beady eyes, a scanty\r\ngrowth of beard, and a loud, assuming voice. "You don\'t believe that no\r\n\'orses is pulled?" he reiterated.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say that no \'orse was never pulled," said Journeyman. He stood\r\nwith his back leaning against the partition, his long legs stretched out.\r\n"If one was really in the know, then I don\'t say nothing about it; but who\r\nof us is ever really in the know?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure about that," said Mr. Stack. "There\'s a young man in my\r\nmansions that \'as a servant; this servant\'s cousin, a girl in the country,\r\nkeeps company with one of the lads in the White House stable. If that\r\nain\'t good enough, I don\'t know what is; good enough for my half-crown and\r\nanother pint of beer too, Mrs. Latch, as you\'ll be that kind."\r\n\r\nEsther drew the beer, and Old John, who had said nothing till now,\r\nsuddenly joined in the conversation. He too had heard of something; he\r\ndidn\'t know if it was the same as Stack had heard of; he didn\'t expect it\r\nwas. It couldn\'t very well be, \'cause no one knew of this particular\r\nhorse, not a soul!--not \'alf-a-dozen people in the world. No, he would\r\ntell no one until his money and the stable money was all right. And he\r\ndidn\'t care for no half-crowns or dollars this time, if he couldn\'t get a\r\nsovereign or two on the horse he\'d let it alone. This time he\'d be a man\r\nor a mouse. Every one was listening intently, but old John suddenly\r\nassumed an air of mystery and refused to say another word. The\r\nconversation worked back whither it had started, and again the best method\r\nof backing horses was passionately discussed. Interrupting someone whose\r\ntheories seemed intolerably ludicrous, Journeyman said--\r\n\r\n"Let\'s \'ear what\'s the governor\'s opinion; he ought to know what kind of\r\nbacker gets the most out of him."\r\n\r\nJourneyman\'s proposal to submit the question to the governor met with very\r\ngeneral approval. Even the vagrant who had taken his tankard of porter to\r\nthe bench where he could drink and eat what fragments of food he had\r\ncollected, came forward, interested to know what kind of backer got most\r\nout of the bookmaker.\r\n\r\n"Well," said William, "I haven\'t been making a book as long as some of\r\nthem, but since you ask me what I think I tell you straight. I don\'t care\r\na damn whether they backs according to their judgment, or their dreams, or\r\ntheir fancy. The cove that follows favourites, or the cove that backs a\r\njockey\'s mount, the cove that makes an occasional bet when he hears of a\r\ngood thing, the cove that bets regular, \'cording to a system--the cove,\r\nyer know, what doubles every time--or the cove that bets as the mood takes\r\nhim--them and all the other coves, too numerous to be mentioned, I\'m glad\r\nto do business with. I cries out to one as \'eartily as to another: \'The\r\nold firm, the old firm, don\'t forget the old firm.... What can I do for\r\nyou to-day, sir?\' There\'s but one sort of cove I can\'t abide."\r\n\r\n"And he is--" said Journeyman.\r\n\r\n"He is Mr. George Buff."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s he? who\'s he?" asked several; and the vagrant caused some amusement\r\nby the question, "Do \'e bet on the course?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he do," said William, "an\' nowhere else. He\'s at every meeting as\r\nreg\'lar as if he was a bookie himself. I \'ates to see his face.... I\'d be\r\na rich man if I\'d all the money that man \'as \'ad out of me in the last\r\nthree years."\r\n\r\n"What should you say was his system?" asked Mr. Stack.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know no more than yerselves."\r\n\r\nThis admission seemed a little chilling; for everyone had thought himself\r\nmany steps nearer El Dorado.\r\n\r\n"But did you ever notice," said Mr. Ketley, "that there was certain days\r\non which he bet?"\r\n\r\n"No, I never noticed that."\r\n\r\n"Are they outsiders that he backs?" asked Stack.\r\n\r\n"No, only favourites. But what I can\'t make out is that there are times\r\nwhen he won\'t touch them; and when he don\'t, nine times out of ten they\'re\r\nbeaten."\r\n\r\n"Are the \'orses he backs what you\'d call well in?" said Journeyman.\r\n\r\n"Not always."\r\n\r\n"Then it must be on information from the stable authorities?" said Stack.\r\n\r\n"I dun know," said William; "have it that way if you like, but I\'m glad\r\nthere ain\'t many about like him. I wish he\'d take his custom elsewhere. He\r\ngives me the solid hump, he do."\r\n\r\n"What sort of man should you say he was? \'as he been a servant, should you\r\nsay?" asked old John.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you what he is. Always new suit of clothes and a hie-glass.\r\nWhenever I see that \'ere hie-glass and that brown beard my heart goes down\r\nin my boots. When he don\'t bet he takes no notice, walks past with a vague\r\nlook on his face, as if he didn\'t see the people, and he don\'t care that\r\nfor the \'orses. Knowing he don\'t mean no business, I cries to him, \'The\r\nbest price, Mr. Buff; two to one on the field, ten to one bar two or\r\nthree.\' He just catches his hie-glass tighter in eye and looks at me,\r\nsmiles, shakes his head, and goes on. He is a warm \'un; he is just about\r\nas \'ot as they make \'em."\r\n\r\n"What I can\'t make out," said Journeyman, "is why he bets on the course.\r\nYou say he don\'t know nothing about horses. Why don\'t he remain at \'ome\r\nand save the exes?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve thought of all that," said William, "and can\'t make no more out of\r\nit than you can yerselves. All we know is that, divided up between five or\r\nsix of us, Buff costs not far short of six \'undred a year."\r\n\r\nAt that moment a small blond man came into the bar. Esther knew him at\r\nonce. It was Ginger. He had hardly changed at all--a little sallower, a\r\nlittle dryer, a trifle less like a gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you step round, sir, to the private bar?" said William. "You\'ll be\r\nmore comfortable."\r\n\r\n"Hardly worth while. I was at the theatre, and I thought I\'d come in and\r\nhave a look round.... I see that you haven\'t forgotten the old horses," he\r\nsaid, catching sight of the prints of Silver Braid and Summer\'s Dean which\r\nWilliam had hung on the wall. "That was a great day, wasn\'t it? Fifty to\r\none chance, started at thirty; and you remember the Gaffer tried him to\r\nwin with twenty pound more than he had to carry.... Hullo, John! very glad\r\nto see you again; growing strong and well, I hope?"\r\n\r\nThe old servant looked so shabby that Esther was not surprised that Ginger\r\ndid not shake hands with him. She wondered if he would remember her, and\r\nas the thought passed through her mind he extended his hand across the\r\nbar.\r\n\r\n"I \'ope I may have the honour of drinking a glass of wine with you, sir,"\r\nsaid William. Ginger raised no objection, and William told Esther to go\r\ndown-stairs and fetch up a bottle of champagne.\r\n\r\nKetley, Journeyman, Stack, and the others listened eagerly. To meet the\r\ncelebrated gentleman-rider was a great event in their lives. But the\r\nconversation was confined to the Barfield horses; it was carried on by the\r\nmerest allusion, and Journeyman wearied of it. He said he must be getting\r\nhome; the others nodded, finished their glasses, and bade William\r\ngood-night as they left. A couple of flower-girls with loose hair, shawls,\r\nand trays of flowers, suggestive of streetfaring, came in and ordered four\r\nale. They spoke to the vagrant, who collected his match-boxes in\r\npreparation for a last search for charity. William cut the wires of the\r\nchampagne, and at that moment Charles, who had gone through with the\r\nladder to turn out the street lamp, returned with a light overcoat on his\r\narm which he said a cove outside wanted to sell him for two-and-six.\r\n\r\n"Do you know him?" said William.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I knowed him. I had to put him out the other night--Bill Evans, the\r\ncove that wears the blue Melton."\r\n\r\nThe swing doors were opened, and a man between thirty and forty came in.\r\nHe was about the medium height; a dark olive skin, black curly hair,\r\npicturesque and disreputable, like a bird of prey in his blue Melton\r\njacket and billycock hat.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better \'ave the coat," he said; "you won\'t better it;" and coming\r\ninto the bar he planked down a penny as if it were a sovereign. "Glass of\r\nporter; nice warm weather, good for the \'arvest. Just come up from the\r\ncountry--a bit dusty, ain\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t you the chap," said William, "what laid Mr. Ketley six \'alf-crowns\r\nto one against Cross Roads?"\r\n\r\nCharles nodded, and William continued--\r\n\r\n"I like your cheek coming into my bar."\r\n\r\n"No harm done, gov\'nor; no one was about; wouldn\'t \'ave done it if they\r\nhad."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do," said William. "... No, he don\'t want the coat. We likes to\r\nknow where our things comes from."\r\n\r\nBill Evans finished his glass. "Good-night, guv\'nor; no ill-feeling."\r\n\r\nThe flower-girls laughed; one offered him a flower. "Take it for love,"\r\nshe said. He was kind enough to do so, and the three went out together.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like the looks of that chap," said William, and he let go the\r\nchampagne cork. "Yer health, sir." They raised their glasses, and the\r\nconversation turned on next week\'s racing.\r\n\r\n"I dun know about next week\'s events," said old John, "but I\'ve heard of\r\nsomething for the Leger--an outsider will win."\r\n\r\n"Have you backed it?"\r\n\r\n"I would if I had the money, but things have been going very unlucky with\r\nme lately. But I\'d advise you, sir, to have a trifle on. It\'s the best tip\r\nI \'ave had in my life."\r\n\r\n"Really!" said Ginger, beginning to feel interested, "so I will, and so\r\nshall you. I\'m damned if you shan\'t have your bit on. Come, what is it?\r\nWilliam will lay the odds. What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Briar Rose, the White House stable, sir."\r\n\r\n"Why, I thought that--"\r\n\r\n"No such thing, sir; Briar Rose\'s the one."\r\n\r\nGinger took up the paper. "Twenty-five to one Briar Rose taken."\r\n\r\n"You see, sir, it was taken."\r\n\r\n"Will you lay the price, William--twenty-five half-sovereigns to one?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll lay it."\r\n\r\nGinger took a half-sovereign from his pocket and handed it to the\r\nbookmaker.\r\n\r\n"I never take money over this bar. You\'re good for a thin \'un, sir,"\r\nWilliam said, with a smile, as he handed back the money.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know when I shall see you again," said Ginger. "It will be\r\nvery inconvenient. There\'s no one in the bar."\r\n\r\n"None but the match-seller and them two flower-girls. I suppose they don\'t\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\nHappiness flickered up through the old greyness of the face. Henceforth\r\nsomething to live for. Each morning bringing news of the horse, and the\r\nhours of the afternoon passing pleasantly, full of thoughts of the evening\r\npaper and the gossip of the bar. A bet on a race brings hope into lives\r\nwhich otherwise would be hopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nNever had a Derby excited greater interest. Four hot favourites, between\r\nwhich the public seemed unable to choose. Two to one taken and offered\r\nagainst Fly-leaf, winner of the Two Thousand; four to one taken and\r\noffered against Signet-ring, who, half-trained, had run Fly-leaf to a\r\nhead. Four to one against Necklace, the winner of the Middle Park Plate\r\nand the One Thousand. Seven to one against Dewberry, the brilliant winner\r\nof the Newmarket stakes. The chances of these horses were argued every\r\nnight at the "King\'s Head." Ketley\'s wife used to wear a string of yellow\r\nbeads when she was a girl, but she wasn\'t certain what had become of them.\r\nKetley did not wear a signet-ring, and had never known anyone who did.\r\nDewberries grew on the river banks, but they were not ripe yet. Fly-leaf,\r\nhe could not make much of that--not being much of a reader. So what with\r\none thing and another Ketley didn\'t believe much in this \'ere Derby.\r\nJourneyman caustically remarked that, omens or no omens, one horse was\r\nbound to win. Why didn\'t Herbert look for an omen among the outsiders? Old\r\nJohn\'s experiences led him to think that the race lay between Fly-leaf and\r\nSignet-ring. He had a great faith in blood, and Signet-ring came of a more\r\nstaying stock than did Fly-leaf. "When they begin to climb out of the dip\r\nFly-leaf will have had about enough of it." Stack nodded approval. He had\r\nfive bob on Dewberry. He didn\'t know much about his staying powers, but\r\nall the stable is on him; "and when I know the stable-money is right I\r\nsays, \'That\'s good enough for me!\'"\r\n\r\nGinger, who came in occasionally, was very sweet on Necklace, whom he\r\ndeclared to be the finest mare of the century. He was listened to with\r\nawed attention, and there was a death-like silence in the bar when he\r\ndescribed how she had won the One Thousand. He wouldn\'t have ridden her\r\nquite that way himself; but then what was a steeplechase rider\'s opinion\r\nworth regarding a flat race? The company demurred, and old John alluded to\r\nGinger\'s magnificent riding when he won the Liverpool on Foxcover,\r\nsteadying the horse about sixty yards from home, and bringing him up with\r\na rush in the last dozen strides, nailing Jim Sutton, who had persevered\r\nall the way, on the very post by a head. Bill Evans, who happened to look\r\nin that evening, said that he would not be surprised to see all the four\r\nfavourites bowled out by an outsider. He had heard something that was good\r\nenough for him. He didn\'t suppose the guv\'nor would take him on the nod,\r\nbut he had a nice watch which ought to be good for three ten.\r\n\r\n"Turn it up, old mate," said William.\r\n\r\n"All right, guv\'nor, I never presses my goods on them that don\'t want \'em.\r\nIf there\'s any other gentleman who would like to look at this \'ere\r\ntimepiece, or a pair of sleeve links, they\'re in for fifteen shillings.\r\nHere\'s the ticket. I\'m a bit short of money, and have a fancy for a\r\ncertain outsider. I\'d like to have my bit on, and I\'ll dispose of the\r\nticket for--what do you say to a thin \'un, Mr. Ketley?"\r\n\r\n"Did you \'ear me speak just now?" William answered angrily, "or shall I\r\nhave to get over the counter?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose, Mrs. Latch, you have seen a great deal of racing?" said\r\nGinger.\r\n\r\n"No, sir. I\'ve heard a great deal about racing, but I never saw a race\r\nrun."\r\n\r\n"How\'s that, shouldn\'t you care?"\r\n\r\n"You see, my husband has his betting to attend to, and there\'s the house\r\nto look after."\r\n\r\n"I never thought of it before," said William. "You\'ve never seen a race\r\nrun, no more you haven\'t. Would you care to come and see the Derby run\r\nnext week, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"I think I should."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the policeman stopped and looked in. All eyes went up to\r\nthe clock, and Esther said, "We shall lose our licence if----"\r\n\r\n"If we don\'t get out," said Ginger.\r\n\r\nWilliam apologised.\r\n\r\n"The law is the law, sir, for rich and poor alike; should be sorry to\r\nhurry you, sir, but in these days very little will lose a man his house.\r\nNow, Herbert, finish your drink. No, Walter, can\'t serve any more liquor\r\nto-night.... Charles, close the private bar, let no one else in.... Now,\r\ngentlemen, gentlemen."\r\n\r\nOld John lit his pipe and led the way. William held the door for them. A\r\nfew minutes after the house was closed.\r\n\r\nA locking of drawers, fastening of doors, putting away glasses, making\r\nthings generally tidy, an hour\'s work before bed-time, and then they\r\nlighted their candle in the little parlour and went upstairs.\r\n\r\nWilliam flung off his coat. "I\'m dead beat," he said, "and all this to\r\nlose----" He didn\'t finish the sentence. Esther said--\r\n\r\n"You\'ve a heavy book on the Derby. Perhaps an outsider\'ll win."\r\n\r\n"I \'ope so.... But if you\'d care to see the race, I think it can be\r\nmanaged. I shall be busy, but Journeyman or Ketley will look after you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I should care to walk about all day with Journeyman,\r\nnor Ketley neither."\r\n\r\nThey were both tired, and with an occasional remark they undressed and got\r\ninto bed. Esther laid her head on the pillow and closed her eyes....\r\n\r\n"I wonder if there\'s any one going who you\'d care for?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a bit about it, Bill." The conversation paused. At the end\r\nof a long silence William said--\r\n\r\n"It do seem strange that you who has been mixed up in it so much should\r\nnever have seen a race." Esther didn\'t answer. She was falling asleep, and\r\nWilliam\'s voice was beginning to sound vague in her ears. Suddenly she\r\nfelt him give her a great shove. "Wake up, old girl, I\'ve got it. Why not\r\nask your old pal, Sarah Tucker, to go with us? I heard John say she\'s out\r\nof situation. It\'ll be a nice treat for her."\r\n\r\n"Ah.... I should like to see Sarah again."\r\n\r\n"You\'re half asleep."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not; you said we might ask Sarah to come to the Derby with us."\r\n\r\nWilliam regretted that he had not a nice trap to drive them down. To hire\r\none would run into a deal of money, and he was afraid it might make him\r\nlate on the course. Besides, the road wasn\'t what it used to be; every one\r\ngoes by train now. They dropped off to sleep talking of how they should\r\nget Sarah\'s address.\r\n\r\nThree or four days passed, and one morning William jumped out of bed and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"I think it will be a fine day, Esther." He took out his best suit of\r\nclothes, and selected a handsome silk scarf for the occasion. Esther was a\r\nheavy sleeper, and she lay close to the wall, curled up. Taking no notice\r\nof her, William went on dressing; then he said--\r\n\r\n"Now then, Esther, get up. Teddy will be here presently to pack up my\r\nclothes."\r\n\r\n"Is it time to get up?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I should think it was. For God\'s sake, get up."\r\n\r\nShe had a new dress for the Derby. It had been bought in Tottenham Court\r\nRoad, and had only come home last night. A real summer dress! A lilac\r\npattern on a white ground, the sleeves and throat and the white hat\r\ntastefully trimmed with lilac and white lace; a nice sunshade to match. At\r\nthat moment a knock came at the door.\r\n\r\n"All right, Teddy, wait a moment, my wife\'s not dressed yet. Do make\r\nhaste, Esther."\r\n\r\nEsther stepped into the skirt so as not to ruffle her hair, and she was\r\nbuttoning the bodice when little Mr. Blamy entered.\r\n\r\n"Sorry to disturb you, ma\'am, but there isn\'t no time to lose if the\r\ngovernor don\'t want to lose his place on the \'ill."\r\n\r\n"Now then, Teddy, make haste, get the toggery out; don\'t stand there\r\ntalking."\r\n\r\nThe little man spread the Gladstone bag upon the floor and took a suit of\r\nchecks from the chest of drawers, each square of black and white nearly as\r\nlarge as a sixpence.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll wear the green tie, sir?" William nodded. The green tie was a yard\r\nof flowing sea-green silk. "I\'ve got you a bunch of yellow flowers, sir;\r\nwill you wear them now, or shall I put them in the bag?"\r\n\r\nWilliam glanced at the bouquet. "They look a bit loud," he said; "I\'ll\r\nwait till we get on the course; put them in the bag."\r\n\r\nThe card to be worn in the white hat--"William Latch, London," in gold\r\nletters on a green ground--was laid on top. The boots with soles three\r\ninches high went into the box on which William stood while he halloaed his\r\nprices to the crowd. Then there were the two poles which supported a strip\r\nof white linen, on which was written in gold letters, "William Latch, \'The\r\nKing\'s Head,\' London. Fair prices, prompt payment."\r\n\r\nIt was a grey day, with shafts of sunlight coming through, and as the cab\r\npassed over Waterloo Bridge, London, various embankments and St. Paul\'s on\r\none side, wharves and warehouses on the other, appeared in grey curves and\r\nstraight silhouettes. The pavements were lined with young men--here and\r\nthere a girl\'s dress was a spot of colour in the grey morning. At the\r\nstation they met Journeyman and old John, but Sarah was nowhere to be\r\nfound. William said--\r\n\r\n"We shall be late; we shall have to go without her."\r\n\r\nEsther\'s face clouded. "We can\'t go without her; don\'t be so impatient."\r\nAt that moment a white muslin was seen in the distance, and Esther said,\r\n"I think that that\'s Sarah."\r\n\r\n"You can chatter in the train--you\'ll have a whole hour to talk about each\r\nother\'s dress; get in, get in," and William pressed them into a\r\nthird-class carriage. They had not seen each other for so long a while,\r\nand there was so much to say that they did not know where to begin. Sarah\r\nwas the first to speak.\r\n\r\n"It was kind of you to think of me. So you\'ve married, and to him after\r\nall!" she added, lowering her voice.\r\n\r\nEsther laughed. "It do seem strange, don\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll tell me all about it," she said. "I wonder we didn\'t run across\r\none another before."\r\n\r\nThey rolled out of the grey station into the light, and the plate-glass\r\ndrew the rays together till they burnt the face and hands. They sped\r\nalongside of the upper windows nearly on a level with the red and yellow\r\nchimney-pots; they passed open spaces filled with cranes, old iron, and\r\nstacks of railway sleepers, pictorial advertisements, sky signs, great\r\ngasometers rising round and black in their iron cages over-topping or\r\nnearly the slender spires. A train steamed along a hundred-arched viaduct;\r\nand along a black embankment the other trains rushed by in a whirl of\r\nwheels, bringing thousands of clerks up from the suburbs to their city\r\ntoil.\r\n\r\nThe excursion jogged on, stopping for long intervals before strips of\r\nsordid garden where shirts and pink petticoats were blowing. Little\r\nstreets ascended the hillsides; no more trams, \'buses, too, had\r\ndisappeared, and afoot the folk hurried along the lonely pavements of\r\ntheir suburbs. At Clapham Junction betting men had crowded the platform;\r\nthey all wore grey overcoats with race-glasses slung over their shoulders.\r\nAnd the train still rolled through the brick wilderness which old John\r\nsaid was all country forty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe men puffed at their pipes, and old John\'s anecdotes about the days\r\nwhen he and the Gaffer, in company with all the great racing men of the\r\nday, used to drive down by road, were listened to with admiration. Esther\r\nhad finished telling the circumstances in which she had met Margaret; and\r\nSarah questioned her about William and how her marriage had come about.\r\nThe train had stopped outside of a little station, and the blue sky, with\r\nits light wispy clouds, became a topic of conversation. Old John did not\r\nlike the look of those clouds, and the women glanced at the waterproofs\r\nwhich they carried on their arms.\r\n\r\nThey passed bits of common with cows and a stray horse, also a little\r\nrural cemetery; but London suddenly began again parish after parish, the\r\nsame blue roofs, the same tenement houses. The train had passed the first\r\ncedar and the first tennis lawn. And knowing it to be a Derby excursion\r\nthe players paused in their play and looked up. Again the line was\r\nblocked; the train stopped again and again. But it had left London behind,\r\nand the last stoppage was in front of a beautiful June landscape. A thick\r\nmeadow with a square weather-beaten church showing between the spreading\r\ntrees; miles of green corn, with birds flying in the bright air, and lazy\r\nclouds going out, making way for the endless blue of a long summer\'s day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that William should don his betting toggery at the\r\n"Spread Eagle Inn." It stood at the cross-roads, only a little way from\r\nthe station--a square house with a pillared porch. Even at this early hour\r\nthe London pilgrimage was filing by. Horses were drinking in the trough;\r\ntheir drivers were drinking in the bar; girls in light dresses shared\r\nglasses of beer with young men. But the greater number of vehicles passed\r\nwithout stopping, anxious to get on the course. They went round the turn\r\nin long procession, a policeman on a strong horse occupied the middle of\r\nthe road. The waggonettes and coaches had red-coated guards, and the air\r\nwas rent with the tooting of the long brass horns. Every kind of dingy\r\ntrap went by, sometimes drawn by two, sometimes by only one horse--shays\r\nhalf a century old jingled along; there were even donkey-carts. Esther and\r\nSarah were astonished at the number of costers, but old John told them\r\nthat that was nothing to what it was fifty years ago. The year that\r\nAndover won the block began seven or eight miles from Epsom. They were\r\noften half-an-hour without moving. Such chaffing and laughing, the coster\r\ncracked his joke with the duke, but all that was done away with now.\r\n\r\n"Gracious!" said Esther, when William appeared in his betting toggery. "I\r\nshouldn\'t have known you."\r\n\r\nHe did seem very wonderful in his checks, green necktie, yellow flowers,\r\nand white hat with its gold inscription, "Mr. William Latch, London."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right," he said; "you never saw me before in these togs--fine,\r\nain\'t they? But we\'re very late. Mr. North has offered to run me up to the\r\ncourse, but he\'s only two places. Teddy and me must be getting along--but\r\nyou needn\'t hurry. The races won\'t begin for hours yet. It\'s only about a\r\nmile--a nice walk. These gentlemen will look after you. You know where to\r\nfind me," he said, turning to John and Walter. "You\'ll look after my wife\r\nand Miss Tucker, won\'t you?" and forthwith he and Teddy jumped into a\r\nwaggonette and drove away.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s what I calls cheek," said Sarah. "Going off by himself in a\r\nwaggonette and leaving us to foot it."\r\n\r\n"He must look after his place on the \'ill or else he\'ll do no betting,"\r\nsaid Journeyman. "We\'ve plenty of time; racing don\'t begin till after\r\none."\r\n\r\nRecollections of what the road had once been had loosened John\'s tongue,\r\nand he continued his reminiscences of the great days when Sir Thomas\r\nHayward had laid fifteen thousand to ten thousand three times over against\r\nthe favourite. The third bet had been laid at this very spot, but the Duke\r\nwould not accept the third bet, saying that the horse was then being\r\nbacked on the course at evens. So Sir Thomas had only lost thirty thousand\r\npounds on the race. Journeyman was deeply interested in the anecdote; but\r\nSarah looked at the old man with a look that said, "Well, if I\'m to pass\r\nthe day with you two I never want to go to the Derby again.... Come on in\r\nfront," she whispered to Esther, "and let them talk about their racing by\r\nthemselves." The way led through a field ablaze with buttercups; it passed\r\nby a fish-pond into which three drunkards were gazing. "Do you hear what\r\nthey\'re saying about the fish?" said Sarah.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pay no attention to them," said Esther. "If you knew as much about\r\ndrunkards as I do, you\'d want no telling to give them a wide berth....\r\nIsn\'t the country lovely? Isn\'t the air soft and warm?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t want no more country. I\'m that glad to get back to town. I\r\nwouldn\'t take another situation out of London if I was offered twenty a\r\nyear."\r\n\r\n"But look," said Esther, "at the trees. I\'ve hardly been in the country\r\nsince I left Woodview, unless you call Dulwich the country--that\'s where\r\nJackie was at nurse."\r\n\r\nThe Cockney pilgrimage passed into a pleasant lane overhung with chestnut\r\nand laburnum trees. The spring had been late, and the white blossoms stood\r\nup like candles--the yellow dropped like tassels, and the streaming\r\nsunlight filled the leaves with tints of pale gold, and their light\r\nshadows patterned the red earth of the pathway. But very soon this\r\npleasant pathway debouched on a thirsting roadway where tired horses\r\nharnessed to heavy vehicles toiled up a long hill leading to the Downs.\r\nThe trees intercepted the view, and the blown dust whitened the foliage\r\nand the wayside grass, now in possession of hawker and vagrant. The crowd\r\nmade way for the traps; and the young men in blue and grey trousers, and\r\ntheir girls in white dresses, turned and watched the four horses bringing\r\nalong the tall drag crowned with London fashion. There the unwieldly\r\nomnibus and the brake filled with fat girls in pink dresses and yellow\r\nhats, and there the spring cart drawn up under a hedge. The cottage gates\r\nwere crowded with folk come to see London going to the Derby. Outhouses\r\nhad been converted into refreshment bars, and from these came a smell of\r\nbeer and oranges; further on there was a lamentable harmonium--a blind man\r\nsinging hymns to its accompaniment, and a one-legged man holding his hat\r\nfor alms; and not far away there stood an earnest-eyed woman offering\r\ntracts, warning folk of their danger, beseeching them to retrace their\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nAt last the trees ceased and they found themselves on the hilltop in a\r\nglare of sunlight, on a space of worn ground where donkeys were tethered.\r\n\r\n"Is this the Derby?" said Sarah.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'re not disappointed?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear; but where\'s all the people--the drags, the carriages?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see them presently," said old John, and he volunteered some\r\nexplanations. The white building was the Grand Stand. The winning-post was\r\na little further this way.\r\n\r\n"Where do they start?" said Sarah.\r\n\r\n"Over yonder, where you see that clump. They run through the furze right\r\nup to Tattenham Corner."\r\n\r\nA vast crowd swarmed over the opposite hill, and beyond the crowd the\r\nwomen saw a piece of open downland dotted with bushes, and rising in\r\ngentle incline to a belt of trees which closed the horizon. "Where them\r\ntrees are, that\'s _Tattenham Corner_." The words seemed to fill old John\r\nwith enthusiasm, and he described how the horses came round this side of\r\nthe trees. "They comes right down that \'ere \'ill--there\'s the dip--and\r\nthey finishes opposite to where we is standing. Yonder, by Barnard\'s\r\nRing."\r\n\r\n"What, all among the people?" said Sarah.\r\n\r\n"The police will get the people right back up the hill."\r\n\r\n"That\'s where we shall find William," said Esther.\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting a bit peckish; ain\'t you, dear? He\'s got the\r\nluncheon-basket.... but, lor\', what a lot of people! Look at that."\r\n\r\nWhat had attracted Sarah\'s attention was a boy walking through the crowd\r\non a pair of stilts fully eight feet high. He uttered short warning cries\r\nfrom time to time, held out his wide trousers and caught pennies in his\r\nconical cap. Drags and carriages continued to arrive. The sweating horses\r\nwere unyoked, and grooms and helpers rolled the vehicles into position\r\nalong the rails. Lackeys drew forth cases of wine and provisions, and the\r\nflutter of table-cloths had begun to attract vagrants, itinerant\r\nmusicians, fortune-tellers, begging children. All these plied their trades\r\nround the fashion of grey frock-coats and silk sun-shades. Along the rails\r\nrough fellows lay asleep; the place looked like a vast dormitory; they lay\r\nwith their hats over their faces, clay pipes sticking from under the\r\nbrims, their brown-red hands upon the grey grass.\r\n\r\nSuddenly old John pleaded an appointment; he was to meet a friend who\r\nwould give him the very latest news respecting a certain horse; and\r\nEsther, Sarah, and Journeyman wandered along the course in search of\r\nWilliam. Along the rails strangely-dressed men stood on stools, satchels\r\nand race-glasses slung over their shoulders, great bouquets in their\r\nbutton-holes. Each stood between two poles on which was stretched a piece\r\nof white-coloured linen, on which was inscribed their name in large gold\r\nletters. Sarah read some of these names out: "Jack Hooper, Marylebone. All\r\nbets paid." "Tom Wood\'s famous boxing rooms, Epsom." "James Webster,\r\nCommission Agent, London." And these betting men bawled the prices from\r\nthe top of their high stools and shook their satchels, which were filled\r\nwith money, to attract custom. "What can I do for you to-day, sir?" they\r\nshouted when they caught the eye of any respectably-dressed man. "On the\r\nDer-by, on the Der-by, I\'ll bet the Der-by.... To win or a place, to win\r\nor a place, to win or a place--seven to one bar two or three, seven to one\r\nbar two or three.... the old firm, the old firm,"--like so many\r\nchallenging cocks, each trying to outshrill the other.\r\n\r\nUnder the hill-side in a quiet hollow had been pitched a large and\r\ncommodious tent. Journeyman mentioned that it was the West London\r\nGospel-tent. He thought the parson would have it pretty well all to\r\nhimself, and they stopped before a van filled with barrels of Watford\r\nales. A barrel had been taken from the van and placed on a small table;\r\nglasses of beer were being served to a thirsty crowd; and all around were\r\nlittle canvas shelters, whence men shouted, "\'Commodation, \'commodation."\r\n\r\nThe sun had risen high, and what clouds remained floated away like\r\nfilaments of white cotton. The Grand Stand, dotted like a ceiling with\r\nflies, stood out distinct and harsh upon a burning plain of blue. The\r\nlight beat fiercely upon the booths, the carriages, the vehicles, the\r\n"rings," the various stands. The country around was lost in the haze and\r\ndazzle of the sunlight; but a square mile of downland fluttered with flags\r\nand canvas, and the great mob swelled, and smoked, and drank, shied sticks\r\nat Aunt Sally, and rode wooden horses. And through this crush of\r\nperspiring, shrieking humanity Journeyman, Esther, and Sarah sought vainly\r\nfor William. The form of the ground was lost in the multitude and they\r\ncould only tell by the strain in their limbs whether they were walking up\r\nor down hill. Sarah declared herself to be done up, and it was with\r\ndifficulty that she was persuaded to persevere a little longer. At last\r\nJourneyman caught sight of the bookmaker\'s square shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Well, so here you are. What can I do for you, ladies? Ten to one bar\r\nthree or four. Will that suit you?"\r\n\r\n"The luncheon-basket will suit us a deal better," said Sarah.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a chap came up jingling two half-crowns in his hand. "What\r\nprice the favourite?" "Two to one," cried William. The two half-crowns\r\nwere dropped into the satchel, and, thus encouraged, William called out\r\nlouder than ever, "The old firm, the old firm; don\'t forget the old firm."\r\nThere was a smile on his lips while he halloaed--a cheery, good-natured\r\nsmile, which made him popular and brought him many a customer.\r\n\r\n"On the Der-by, on the Der-by, on the Der-by!" All kinds and conditions of\r\nmen came to make bets with him; custom was brisk; he could not join the\r\nwomen, who were busy with the lunch-basket, but he and Teddy would be\r\nthankful for the biggest drink they could get them. "Ginger beer with a\r\ndrop of whiskey in it, that\'s about it, Teddy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, guv\'nor, that\'ll do for me.... We\'re getting pretty full on\r\nDewberry; might come down a point, I think."\r\n\r\n"All right, Teddy.... And if you\'d cut us a couple each of strong\r\nsandwiches--you can manage a couple, Teddy?"\r\n\r\n"I think I can, guv\'nor."\r\n\r\nThere was a nice piece of beef in the basket, and Esther cut several large\r\nsandwiches, buttering the bread thickly and adding plenty of mustard. When\r\nshe brought them over William bent down and whispered--\r\n\r\n"My own duck of a wife, there\'s no one like her."\r\n\r\nEsther blushed and laughed with pleasure, and every trace of the\r\nresentment for the suffering he had occasioned her dropped out of her\r\nheart. For the first time he was really her husband; for the first time\r\nshe felt that sense of unity in life which is marriage, and knew\r\nhenceforth he was the one thing that she had to live for.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon Journeyman, who was making no way with Sarah, took his\r\nleave, pleading that he had some friends to meet in Barnard\'s Ring. They\r\nwere glad to be rid of him. Sarah had many a tale to tell; and while\r\nlistening to the matrimonial engagements that had been broken off, Esther\r\nshifted her parasol from time to time to watch her tall, gaunt husband. He\r\nshouted the odds, willing to bet against every horse, distributed tickets\r\nto the various folk that crowded round him, each with his preference, his\r\nprejudice, his belief in omens, in tips, or in the talent and luck of a\r\nfavourite jockey. Sarah continued her cursive chatter regarding the places\r\nshe had served in. She felt inclined for a snooze, but was afraid it would\r\nnot look well. While hesitating she ceased speaking, and both women fell\r\nasleep under the shade of their parasols. It was the shallow, glassy sleep\r\nof the open air, through which they divined easily the great blur that was\r\nthe race-course.\r\n\r\nThey could hear William\'s voice, and they heard a bell ring and shouts of\r\n"Here they come!" Then a lull came, and their perceptions grew a little\r\ndenser, and when they awoke the sky was the same burning blue, and the\r\nmultitude moved to and fro like puppets.\r\n\r\nSarah was in no better temper after than before her sleep. "It\'s all very\r\nwell for you," she said. "You have your husband to look after.... I\'ll\r\nnever come to the Derby again without a young man... I\'m tired of sitting\r\nhere, the grass is roasting. Come for a walk."\r\n\r\nThey were two nice-looking English women of the lower classes, prettily\r\ndressed in light gowns with cheap sunshades in their cotton-gloved hands.\r\nSarah looked at every young man with regretful eyes. In such moods\r\nacquaintanceships are made; and she did not allow Esther to shake off Bill\r\nEvans, who, just as if he had never been turned out of the bar of the\r\n"King\'s Head," came up with his familiar, "Good morning, ma\'am--lovely\r\nweather for the races." Sarah\'s sidelong glances at the blue Melton jacket\r\nand the billycock hat defined her feelings with sufficient explicitness,\r\nand it was not probable that any warning would have been heeded. Soon they\r\nwere engaged in animated conversation, and Esther was left to follow them\r\nif she liked.\r\n\r\nShe walked by Sarah\'s side, quite ignored, until she was accosted by Fred\r\nParsons. They were passing by the mission tent, and Fred was calling upon\r\nthe folk to leave the ways of Satan for those of Christ. Bill Evans was\r\nabout to answer some brutal insult; but seeing that "the Christian" knew\r\nEsther he checked himself in time. Esther stopped to speak to Fred, and\r\nBill seized the opportunity to slip away with Sarah.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t expect to meet you here, Esther."\r\n\r\n"I\'m here with my husband. He said a little pleasure----"\r\n\r\n"This is not innocent pleasure, Esther; this is drunkenness and\r\ndebauchery. I hope you\'ll never come again, unless you come with us," he\r\nsaid, pointing to some girls dressed as bookmakers, with Salvation and\r\nPerdition written on the satchels hung round their shoulders. They sought\r\nto persuade the passers-by to come into the tent. "We shall be very glad\r\nto see you," they said, and they distributed mock racing cards on which\r\nwas inscribed news regarding certain imaginary racing. "The Paradise\r\nPlate, for all comers," "The Salvation Stakes, an Eternity of Happiness\r\nadded."\r\n\r\nFred repeated his request. "I hope the next time you come here it will be\r\nwith us; you\'ll strive to collect some of Christ\'s lost sheep."\r\n\r\n"And my husband making a book yonder?"\r\n\r\nAn awkward silence intervened, and then he said--\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come in; service is going on?"\r\n\r\nEsther followed him. In the tent there were some benches, and on a\r\nplatform a grey-bearded man with an anxious face spoke of sinners and\r\nredemption. Suddenly a harmonium began to play a hymn, and, standing side\r\nby side, Esther and Fred sang together. Prayer was so inherent in her that\r\nshe felt no sense of incongruity, and had she been questioned she would\r\nhave answered that it did not matter where we are, or what we are doing,\r\nwe can always have God in our hearts.\r\n\r\nFred followed her out.\r\n\r\n"You have not forgotten your religion, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"No, I never could forget that."\r\n\r\n"Then why do I find you in such company? You don\'t come here like us to\r\nfind sinners."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t forgotten God, but I must do my duty to my husband. It would be\r\nlike setting myself up against my husband\'s business, and you don\'t think\r\nI ought to do that? A wife that brings discord into the family is not a\r\ngood wife, so I\'ve often heard."\r\n\r\n"You always thought more of your husband than of Christ, Esther."\r\n\r\n"Each one must follow Christ as best he can! It would be wrong of me to\r\nset myself against my husband."\r\n\r\n"So he married you?" Fred answered bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Yes. You thought he\'d desert me a second time; but he\'s been the best of\r\nhusbands."\r\n\r\n"I place little reliance on those who are not with Christ. His love for\r\nyou is not of the Spirit. Let us not speak of him. I loved you very\r\ndeeply, Esther. I would have brought you to Christ.... But perhaps you\'ll\r\ncome to see us sometimes."\r\n\r\n"I do not forget Christ. He\'s always with me, and I believe you did care\r\nfor me. I was sorry to break it off, you know I was. It was not my fault."\r\n\r\n"Esther, it was I who loved you."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t talk like that. I\'m a married woman."\r\n\r\n"I mean no harm, Esther. I was only thinking of the past."\r\n\r\n"You must forget all that... Good-bye; I\'m glad to have seen you, and that\r\nwe said a prayer together."\r\n\r\nFred didn\'t answer, and Esther moved away, wondering where she should find\r\nSarah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crowd shouted. She looked where the others looked, but saw only the\r\nburning blue with the white stand marked upon it. It was crowded like the\r\ndeck of a sinking vessel, and Esther wondered at the excitement, the cause\r\nof which was hidden from her. She wandered to the edge of the crowd until\r\nshe came to a chalk road where horses and mules were tethered. A little\r\nhigher up she entered the crowd again, and came suddenly upon a switchback\r\nrailway. Full of laughing and screaming girls, it bumped over a middle\r\nhill, and then rose slowly till it reached the last summit. It was shot\r\nback again into the midst of its fictitious perils, and this mock voyaging\r\nwas accomplished to the sound of music from a puppet orchestra. Bells and\r\ndrums, a fife and a triangle, cymbals clashed mechanically, and a little\r\nsoldier beat the time. Further on, under a striped awning, were the wooden\r\nhorses. They were arranged so well that they rocked to and fro, imitating\r\nas nearly as possible the action of real horses. Esther watched the\r\nriders. A blue skirt looked like a riding habit, and a girl in salmon pink\r\nleaned back in her saddle just as if she had been taught how to ride. A\r\ngirl in a grey jacket encouraged a girl in white who rode a grey horse.\r\nBut before Esther could make out for certain that the man in the blue\r\nMelton jacket was Bill Evans he had passed out of sight, and she had to\r\nwait until his horse came round the second time. At that moment she caught\r\nsight of the red poppies in Sarah\'s hat.\r\n\r\nThe horses began to slacken speed. They went slower and slower, then\r\nstopped altogether. The riders began to dismount and Esther pressed\r\nthrough the bystanders, fearing she would not be able to overtake her\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n"Oh, here you are," said Sarah. "I thought I never should find you again.\r\nHow hot it is!"\r\n\r\n"Were you on in that ride? Let\'s have another, all three of us. These\r\nthree horses."\r\n\r\nRound and round they went, their steeds bobbing nobly up and down to the\r\nsound of fifes, drums and cymbals. They passed the winning-post many\r\ntimes; they had to pass it five times, and the horse that stopped nearest\r\nit won the prize. A long-drawn-out murmur, continuous as the sea, swelled\r\nup from the course--a murmur which at last passed into words: "Here they\r\ncome; blue wins, the favourite\'s beat." Esther paid little attention to\r\nthese cries; she did not understand them; they reached her indistinctly\r\nand soon died away, absorbed in the strident music that accompanied the\r\ncircling horses. These had now begun to slacken speed.... They went slower\r\nand slower. Sarah and Bill, who rode side by side, seemed like winning,\r\nbut at the last moment they glided by the winning-post. Esther\'s steed\r\nstopped in time, and she was told to choose a china mug from a great heap.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve all the luck to-day," said Bill. "Hayfield, who was backed all the\r\nwinter, broke down a month ago.... 2 to 1 against Fly-leaf, 4 to 1 against\r\nSignet-ring, 4 to 1 against Dewberry, 10 to 1 against Vanguard, the winner\r\nat 50 to 1 offered. Your husband must have won a little fortune. Never was\r\nthere such a day for the bookies."\r\n\r\nEsther said she was very glad, and was undecided which mug she should\r\nchoose. At last she saw one on which "Jack" was written in gold letters.\r\nThey then visited the peep-shows, and especially liked St. James\'s Park\r\nwith the Horse Guards out on parade; the Spanish bull-fight did not stir\r\nthem, and Sarah couldn\'t find a single young man to her taste in the House\r\nof Commons. Among the performing birds they liked best a canary that\r\nclimbed a ladder. Bill was attracted by the American strength-testers, and\r\nhe gave an exhibition of his muscle, to Sarah\'s very great admiration.\r\nThey all had some shies at cocoa-nuts, and passed by J. Bilton\'s great\r\nbowling saloon without visiting it. Once more the air was rent with the\r\ncries of "Here they come! Here they come!" Even the \'commodation men left\r\ntheir canvas shelters and pressed forward inquiring which had won. A\r\nmoment after a score of pigeons floated and flew through the blue air and\r\nthen departed in different directions, some making straight for London,\r\nothers for the blue mysterious evening that had risen about the Downs--the\r\nsun-baked Downs strewn with waste paper and covered by tipsy men and\r\nwomen, a screaming and disordered animality.\r\n\r\n"Well, so you\'ve come back at last," said William. "The favourite was\r\nbeaten. I suppose you know that a rank outsider won. But what about this\r\ngentleman?"\r\n\r\n"Met these \'ere ladies on the \'ill an\' been showing them over the course.\r\nNo offence, I hope, guv\'nor?"\r\n\r\nWilliam did not answer, and Bill took leave of Sarah in a manner that told\r\nEsther that they had arranged to meet again.\r\n\r\n"Where did you pick up that bloke?"\r\n\r\n"He came up and spoke to us, and Esther stopped to speak to the parson."\r\n\r\n"To the parson. What do you mean?"\r\n\r\nThe circumstance was explained, and William asked them what they thought\r\nof the racing.\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t see no racing," said Sarah; "we was on the \'ill on the wooden\r\n\'orses. Esther\'s \'orse won. She got a mug; show the mug, Esther."\r\n\r\n"So you saw no Derby after all?" said William.\r\n\r\n"Saw no racin\'!" said his neighbour; "ain\'t she won the cup?"\r\n\r\nThe joke was lost on the women, who only perceived that they were being\r\nlaughed at.\r\n\r\n"Come up here, Esther," said William; "stand on my box. The \'orses are\r\njust going up the course for the preliminary canter. And you, Sarah, take\r\nTeddy\'s place. Teddy, get down, and let the lady up."\r\n\r\n"Yes, guv\'nor. Come up \'ere, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"And is those the \'orses?" said Sarah. "They do seem small."\r\n\r\nThe ringmen roared. "Not up to those on the \'ill, ma\'am," said one. "Not\r\nsuch beautiful goers," said another.\r\n\r\nThere were two or three false starts, and then, looking through a\r\nmultitude of hats, Esther saw five or six thin greyhound-looking horses.\r\nThey passed like shadows, flitted by; and she was sorry for the poor\r\nchestnut that trotted in among the crowd.\r\n\r\nThis was the last race. Once more the favourite had been beaten; there\r\nwere no bets to pay, and the bookmakers began to prepare for departure. It\r\nwas the poor little clerks who were charged with the luggage. Teddy did\r\nnot seem as if he would ever reach the top of the hill. With Esther and\r\nSarah on either arm, William struggled with the crowd. It was hard to get\r\nthrough the block of carriages. Everywhere horses waited with their\r\nharness on, and Sarah was afraid of being bitten or kicked. A young\r\naristocrat cursed them from the box-seat, and the groom blew a blast as\r\nthe drag rolled away. It was like the instinct of departure which takes a\r\nvast herd at a certain moment. The great landscape, half country, half\r\nsuburb, glinted beneath the rays of a setting sun; and through the white\r\ndust, and the drought of the warm roads, the brakes and carriages and\r\nevery crazy vehicle rolled towards London; orange-sellers, tract-sellers,\r\nthieves, vagrants, gipsies, made for their various quarters--roadside\r\ninns, outhouses, hayricks, hedges, or the railway station. Down the long\r\nhill the vast crowd made its way, humble pedestrians and carriage folk,\r\nall together, as far as the cross-roads. At the "Spread Eagle" there would\r\nbe stoppage for a parting drink, there the bookmakers would change their\r\nclothes, and there division would happen in the crowd--half for the\r\nrailway station, half for the London road. It was there that the\r\ntraditional sports of the road began. A drag, with a band of exquisites\r\narmed with pea-shooters, peppering on costers who were getting angry, and\r\nthreatening to drive over the leaders. A brake with two poles erected, and\r\nhanging on a string quite a line of miniature chamber-pots. A horse, with\r\nhis fore-legs clothed in a pair of lady\'s drawers. Naturally unconscious\r\nof the garment, the horse stepped along so absurdly that Esther and Sarah\r\nthought they\'d choke with laughter.\r\n\r\nAt the station William halloaed to old John, whom he caught sight of on\r\nthe platform. He had backed the winner--forty to one about Sultan. It was\r\nKetley who had persuaded him to risk half a sovereign on the horse. Ketley\r\nwas at the Derby; he had met him on the course, and Ketley had told him a\r\nwonderful story about a packet of Turkish Delight. The omen had come right\r\nthis time, and Journeyman took a back seat.\r\n\r\n"Say what you like," said William, "it is damned strange; and if anyone\r\ndid find the way of reading them omens there would be an end of us\r\nbookmakers." He was only half in earnest, but he regretted he had not met\r\nKetley. If he had only had a fiver on the horse--200 to 5!\r\n\r\nThey met Ketley at Waterloo, and every one wanted to hear from his own\r\nlips the story of the packet of Turkish Delight. So William proposed they\r\nshould all come up to the "King\'s Head" for a drink. The omnibus took them\r\nas far as Piccadilly Circus; and there the weight of his satchel tempted\r\nWilliam to invite them to dinner, regardless of expense.\r\n\r\n"Which is the best dinner here?" he asked the commissionaire.\r\n\r\n"The East Room is reckoned the best, sir."\r\n\r\nThe fashion of the shaded candles and the little tables, and the beauty of\r\nan open evening bodice and the black and white elegance of the young men\r\nat dinner, took the servants by surprise, and made them feel that they\r\nwere out of place in such surroundings. Old John looked like picking up a\r\nnapkin and asking at the nearest table if anything was wanted. Ketley\r\nproposed the grill room, but William, who had had a glass more than was\r\ngood for him, declared that he didn\'t care a damn--that he could buy up\r\nthe whole blooming show. The head-waiter suggested a private room; it was\r\nabruptly declined, and William took up the menu. "Bisque Soup, what\'s\r\nthat? You ought to know, John." John shook his head. "Ris de veau! That\r\nreminds me of when----" William stopped and looked round to see if his\r\nformer wife was in the room. Finally, the head-waiter was cautioned to\r\nsend them up the best dinner in the place. Allusion was made to the dust\r\nand heat. Journeyman suggested a sluice, and they inquired their way to\r\nthe lavatories. Esther and Sarah were away longer than the men, and stood\r\ndismayed at the top of the room till William called for them. The other\r\nguests seemed a little terrified, and the head-waiter, to reassure them,\r\nmentioned that it was Derby Day.\r\n\r\nWilliam had ordered champagne, but it had not proved to any one\'s taste\r\nexcept, perhaps, to Sarah, whom it rendered unduly hilarious; nor did the\r\ndelicate food afford much satisfaction; the servants played with it, and\r\nleft it on their plates; and it was not until William ordered up the\r\nsaddle of mutton and carved it himself that the dinner began to take hold\r\nof the company. Esther and Sarah enjoyed the ices, and the men stuck to\r\nthe cheese, a fine Stilton, which was much appreciated. Coffee no one\r\ncared for, and the little glasses of brandy only served to augment the\r\ngeneral tipsiness. William hiccupped out an order for a bottle of Jamieson\r\neight-year-old; but pipes were not allowed, and cigars were voted tedious,\r\nso they adjourned to the bar, where they were free to get as drunk as they\r\npleased. William said, "Now let\'s \'ear the blo----the bloody omen that put\r\nye on to Sultan--that blood--packet of Turkish Delight."\r\n\r\n"Most extra--most extraordinary thing I ever heard in my life, so yer\r\n\'ere?" said Ketley, staring at William and trying to see him distinctly.\r\n\r\nWilliam nodded. "How was it? We want to \'ear all about it. Do hold yer\r\ntongue, Sarah. I beg pardon, Ketley is go--going to tell us about the\r\nbloody omen. Thought you\'d like to he--ar, old girl."\r\n\r\nAllusion was made to a little girl coming home from school, and a piece of\r\npaper on the pavement. But Ketley could not concentrate his thoughts on\r\nthe main lines of the story, and it was lost in various dissertations. But\r\nthe company was none the less pleased with it, and willingly declared that\r\nbookmaking was only a game for mugs. Get on a winner at forty to one, and\r\nyou could make as much in one bet as a poor devil of a bookie could in six\r\nmonths, fagging from race-course to race-course. They drank, argued, and\r\nquarrelled, until Esther noticed that Sarah was looking very pale. Old\r\nJohn was quite helpless; Journeyman, who seemed to know what he was doing,\r\nvery kindly promised to look after him.\r\n\r\nKetley assured the commissionaire that he was not drunk; and when they got\r\noutside Sarah felt obliged to step aside; she came back, saying that she\r\nfelt a little better.\r\n\r\nThey stood on the pavement\'s edge, a little puzzled by the brilliancy of\r\nthe moonlight. And the three men who followed out of the bar-room were\r\nagreed regarding the worthlessness of life. One said, "I don\'t think much\r\nof it; all I live for is beer and women." The phrase caught on William\'s\r\near, and he said, "Quite right, old mate," and he held out his hand to\r\nBill Evans. "Beer and women, it always comes round to that in the end, but\r\nwe mustn\'t let them hear us say it." The men shook hands, and Bill\r\npromised to see Sarah safely home. Esther tried to interpose, but William\r\ncould not be made to understand, and Sarah and Bill drove away together in\r\na hansom. Sarah dozed off immediately on his shoulder, and it was\r\ndifficult to awaken her when the cab stopped before a house whose\r\nrespectability took Bill by surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThings went well enough as long as her savings lasted. When her money was\r\ngone Bill returned to the race-course in the hope of doing a bit of\r\nwelshing. Soon after he was "wanted" by the police; they escaped to\r\nBelgium, and it devolved on Sarah to support him. The hue and cry over,\r\nthey came back to London.\r\n\r\nShe had been sitting up for him; he had come home exasperated and\r\ndisappointed. A row soon began; and she thought that he would strike her.\r\nBut he refrained, for fear, perhaps, of the other lodgers. He took her\r\ninstead by the arm, dragged her down the broken staircase, and pushed her\r\ninto the court. She heard the retreating footsteps, and saw a cat slink\r\nthrough a grating, and she wished that she too could escape from the light\r\ninto the dark.\r\n\r\nA few belated women still lingered in the Strand, and the city stood up\r\nlike a prison, hard and stark in the cold, penetrating light of morning.\r\nShe sat upon a pillar\'s base, her eyes turned towards the cabmen\'s\r\nshelter. The horses munched in their nose-bags, and the pigeons came down\r\nfrom their roosts. She was dressed in an old black dress, her hands lay\r\nupon her knees, and the pose expressed so perfectly the despair and\r\nwretchedness in her soul that a young man in evening clothes, who had\r\nlooked sharply at her as he passed, turned and came back to her, and he\r\nasked her if he could assist her. She answered, "Thank you, sir." He\r\nslipped a shilling into her hand. She was too broken-hearted to look up in\r\nhis face, and he walked away wondering what was her story. The disordered\r\nred hair, the thin, freckled face, were expressive, and so too was the\r\nmovement of her body when she got up and walked, not knowing and not\r\ncaring where she was going. There was sensation of the river in her\r\nthoughts; the river drew her, and she indistinctly remembered that she\r\nwould find relief there if she chose to accept that relief. The water was\r\nblue beneath the sunrise, and it seemed to offer to end her life\'s\r\ntrouble. She could not go on living. She could not bear with her life any\r\nlonger, and yet she knew that she would not drown herself that morning.\r\nThere was not enough will in her to drown herself. She was merely half\r\ndead with grief. He had turned her out, he had said that he never wanted\r\nto see her again, but that was because he had been unlucky. She ought to\r\nhave gone to bed and not waited up for him; he didn\'t know what he was\r\ndoing; so long as he didn\'t care for another woman there was hope that he\r\nmight come back to her. The spare trees rustled their leaves in the bright\r\ndawn air, and she sat down on a bench and watched the lamps going out, and\r\nthe river changing from blue to brown. Hours passed, and the same thoughts\r\ncame and went, until with sheer weariness of thinking she fell asleep.\r\n\r\nShe was awakened by the policeman, and she once more continued her walk.\r\nThe omnibuses had begun; women were coming from market with baskets on\r\ntheir arms; and she wondered if their lovers and husbands were unfaithful\r\nto them, if they would be received with blows or knocks when they\r\nreturned. Her slightest mistakes had often, it seemed, merited a blow; and\r\nGod knows she had striven to pick out the piece of bacon that she thought\r\nhe would like, and it was not her fault that she couldn\'t get any money\r\nnowhere. Why was he cruel to her? He never would find another woman to\r\ncare for him more than she did.... Esther had a good husband, Esther had\r\nalways been lucky. Two hours more to wait, and she felt so tired, so\r\ntired. The milk-women were calling their ware--those lusty short-skirted\r\nwomen that bring an air of country into the meanest alley. She sat down on\r\na doorstep and looked on the empty Haymarket, vaguely conscious of the low\r\nvice which still lingered there though the morning was advancing. She\r\nturned up Shaftesbury Avenue, and from the beginning of Dean Street she\r\nwatched to see if the shutters were yet down. She thought they were, and\r\nthen saw that she was mistaken. There was nothing to do but to wait, and\r\non the steps of the Royalty Theatre she waited. The sun was shining, and\r\nshe watched the cab horses, until the potboy came through and began\r\ncleaning the street lamp. She didn\'t care to ask him any questions;\r\ndressed as she was, he might answer her rudely. She wanted to see Esther\r\nfirst. Esther would pity and help her. So she did not go directly to the\r\n"King\'s Head," but went up the street a little way and came back. The\r\nboy\'s back was turned to her; she peeped through the doors. There was no\r\none in the bar, she must go back to the steps of the theatre. A number of\r\nchildren were playing there, and they did not make way for her to sit\r\ndown. She was too weary to argue the point, and walked up and down the\r\nstreet. When she looked through the doors a second time Esther was in the\r\nbar.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Sarah?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is me."\r\n\r\n"Then come in.... How is it that we\'ve not seen you all this time? What\'s\r\nthe matter?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been out all night. Bill put me out of doors this morning, and I\'ve\r\nbeen walking about ever since."\r\n\r\n"Bill put you out of doors? I don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"You know Bill Evans, the man we met on the race-course, the day we went\r\nto the Derby.... It began there. He took me home after your dinner at the\r\n\'Criterion.\'... It has been going on ever since."\r\n\r\n"Good Lord! ...Tell me about it."\r\n\r\nLeaning against the partition that separated the bars, Sarah told how she\r\nhad left her home and gone to live with him.\r\n\r\n"We got on pretty well at first, but the police was after him, and we made\r\noff to Belgium. There we was very hard up, and I had to go out on the\r\nstreets."\r\n\r\n"He made you do that?"\r\n\r\n"He couldn\'t starve, could he?"\r\n\r\nThe women looked at each other, and then Sarah continued her story. She\r\ntold how they had come to London, penniless. "I think he wants to turn\r\nhonest," she said, "but luck\'s been dead against him.... It\'s that\r\ndifficult for one like him, and he\'s been in work, but he can\'t stick to\r\nit; and now I don\'t know what he\'s doing--no good, I fancy. Last night I\r\ngot anxious and couldn\'t sleep, so I sat up. It was about two when he came\r\nin. We had a row and he dragged me downstairs and he put me out. He said\r\nhe never wanted to see my ugly face again. I don\'t think I\'m as bad as\r\nthat; I\'ve led a hard life, and am not what I used to be, but it was he\r\nwho made me what I am. Oh, it don\'t matter now, it can\'t be helped, it is\r\nall over with me. I don\'t care what becomes of me, only I thought I\'d like\r\nto come and tell you. We was always friends."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t give way like that, old girl. You must keep yer pecker up.\r\nYou\'re dead beat.... You\'ve been walking about all night, no wonder. You\r\nmust come and have some breakfast with us."\r\n\r\n"I should like a cup of tea, Esther. I never touches spirits now. I got\r\nover that."\r\n\r\n"Come into the parlour. You\'ll be better when you\'ve had breakfast. We\'ll\r\nsee what we can do for you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Esther, not a word of what I\'ve been telling you to your husband. I\r\ndon\'t want to get Bill into trouble. He\'d kill me. Promise me not to\r\nmention a word of it. I oughtn\'t to have told you. I was so tired that I\r\ndidn\'t know what I was saying."\r\n\r\nThere was plenty to eat--fried fish, a nice piece of steak, tea and\r\ncoffee. "You seem to live pretty well," said Sarah, "It must be nice to\r\nhave a servant of one\'s own. I suppose you\'re doing pretty well here."\r\n\r\n"Yes, pretty well, if it wasn\'t for William\'s health."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter? Ain\'t he well?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s been very poorly lately. It\'s very trying work going about from\r\nrace-course to race-course, standing in the mud and wet all day long....\r\nHe caught a bad cold last winter and was laid up with inflammation of the\r\nlungs, and I don\'t think he ever quite got over it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t he go no more to race meetings?"\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t been to a race meeting since the beginning of the winter. It\r\nwas one of them nasty steeplechase meetings that laid him up."\r\n\r\n"Do \'e drink?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s never drunk, but he takes too much. Spirits don\'t suit him. He\r\nthought he could do what he liked, great strong-built fellow that he is,\r\nbut he\'s found out his mistake."\r\n\r\n"He does his betting in London now, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Esther, hesitating--"when he has any to do. I want him to give\r\nit up; but trade is bad in this neighbourhood, leastways, with us, and he\r\ndon\'t think we could do without it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very hard to keep it dark; some one\'s sure to crab it and bring the\r\npolice down on you."\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer; the conversation paused, and William entered.\r\n"Halloa! is that you, Sarah? We didn\'t know what had become of you all\r\nthis time." He noticed that she looked like one in trouble, and was very\r\npoorly dressed. She noticed that his cheeks were thinner than they used to\r\nbe, and that his broad chest had sunk, and that there seemed to be\r\nstrangely little space between it and his back. Then in brief phrases,\r\ninterrupting each other frequently, the women told the story. William\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"I knew he was a bad lot. I never liked to see him inside my bar."\r\n\r\n"I thought," said Esther, "that Sarah might remain here for a time."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t have that fellow coming round my place."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no fear of his coming after me. He don\'t want to see my ugly face\r\nagain. Well, let him try to find some one who will do for him all I have\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"Until she gets a situation," said Esther. "I think that\'ll be the best,\r\nfor you to stop here until you get a situation."\r\n\r\n"And what about a character?"\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t say much about what you\'ve been doing this last twelve\r\nmonths; if many questions are asked, you can say you\'ve been stopping with\r\nus. But you mustn\'t see that brute again. If he ever comes into that \'ere\r\nbar, I\'ll give him a piece of my mind. I\'d give him more than a piece of\r\nmy mind if I was the man I was a twelvemonth ago." William coughed, and\r\nEsther looked at him anxiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nLacking a parlour on the ground floor for the use of special customers,\r\nWilliam had arranged a room upstairs where they could smoke and drink.\r\nThere were tables in front of the windows and chairs against the walls,\r\nand in the middle of the room a bagatelle board.\r\n\r\nWhen William left off going to race-courses he had intended to refrain\r\nfrom taking money across the bar and to do all his betting business in\r\nthis room.\r\n\r\nHe thought that it would be safer. But as his customers multiplied he\r\nfound that he could not ask them all upstairs; it attracted more attention\r\nthan to take the money quietly across the bar. Nevertheless the room\r\nupstairs had proved a success. A man spent more money if he had a room\r\nwhere he could sit quietly among his friends than he would seated on a\r\nhigh stool in a public bar, jostled and pushed about; so it had come to be\r\nconsidered a sort of club room; and a large part of the neighbourhood came\r\nthere to read the papers, to hear and discuss the news. And specially\r\nuseful it had proved to Journeyman and Stack. Neither was now in\r\nemployment; they were now professional backers; and from daylight to dark\r\nthey wandered from public-house to public-house, from tobacconist to\r\nbarber\'s shop, in the search of tips, on the quest of stable information\r\nregarding the health of the horses and their trials. But the room upstairs\r\nat the "King\'s Head" was the centre of their operations. Stack was the\r\nindefatigable tipster, Journeyman was the scientific student of public\r\nform. His memory was prodigious, and it enabled him to note an advantage\r\nin the weights which would escape an ordinary observer. He often picked\r\nout horses which, if they did not actually win, nearly always stood at a\r\nshort price in the betting before the race.\r\n\r\nThe "King\'s Head" was crowded during the dinner-hour. Barbers and their\r\nassistants, cabmen, scene-shifters, if there was an afternoon performance\r\nat the theatre, servants out of situation and servants escaped from their\r\nservice for an hour, petty shopkeepers, the many who grow weary of the\r\nscant livelihood that work brings them, came there. Eleven o\'clock! In\r\nanother hour the bar and the room upstairs would be crowded. At present\r\nthe room was empty, and Journeyman had taken advantage of the quiet time\r\nto do a bit of work at his handicap. All the racing of the last three\r\nyears lay within his mind\'s range; he recalled at will every trifling\r\nselling race; hardly ever was he obliged to refer to the Racing Calendar.\r\nWanderer had beaten Brick at ten pounds. Snow Queen had beaten Shoemaker\r\nat four pounds, and Shoemaker had beaten Wanderer at seven pounds. The\r\nproblem was further complicated by the suspicion that Brick could get a\r\ndistance of ground better than Snow Queen. Journeyman was undecided. He\r\nstroked his short brown moustache with his thin, hairy hand, and gnawed\r\nthe end of his pen. In this moment of barren reflection Stack came into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"Still at yer \'andicap, I see," said Stack. "How does it work out?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty well," said Journeyman. "But I don\'t think it will be one of my\r\nbest; there is some pretty hard nuts to crack."\r\n\r\n"Which are they?" said Stack. Journeyman brightened up, and he proceeded\r\nto lay before Stack\'s intelligence what he termed a "knotty point in\r\ncollateral running."\r\n\r\nStack listened with attention, and thus encouraged, Journeyman proceeded\r\nto point out certain distributions of weight which he said seemed to him\r\ndifficult to beat.\r\n\r\n"Anyone what knows the running would say there wasn\'t a pin to choose\r\nbetween them at the weights. If this was the real \'andicap, I\'d bet drinks\r\nall around that fifteen of these twenty would accept. And that\'s more than\r\nanyone will be able to say for Courtney\'s \'andicap. The weights will be\r\nout to-morrow; we shall see."\r\n\r\n"What do you say to \'alf a pint," said Stack, "and we\'ll go steadily\r\nthrough your \'andicap? You\'ve nothing to do for the next \'alf-hour."\r\n\r\nJourneyman\'s dingy face lit up. When the potboy appeared in answer to the\r\nbell he was told to bring up two half-pints, and Journeyman read out the\r\nweights. Every now and then he stopped to explain his reasons for what\r\nmight seem to be superficial, an unmerited severity, or an undue leniency.\r\nIt was not usual for Journeyman to meet with so sympathetic a listener; he\r\nhad often been made to feel that his handicapping was unnecessary, and he\r\nnow noticed, and with much pleasure, that Stack\'s attention seemed to\r\nincrease rather than to diminish as he approached the end. When he had\r\nfinished Stack said, "I see you\'ve given six-seven to Ben Jonson. Tell me\r\nwhy you did that?"\r\n\r\n"He was a good \'orse once; he\'s broken down and aged; he can\'t be trained,\r\nso six-seven seems just the kind of weight to throw him in at. You\r\ncouldn\'t give him less, however old and broken down he may be. He was a\r\ngood horse when he won the Great Ebor Grand Cup."\r\n\r\n"Do you think if they brought him to the post as fit and well as he was\r\nthe day he won the Ebor that he\'d win?"\r\n\r\n"What, fit and well as he was when he won the Great Ebor, and with\r\nsix-seven on his back? He\'d walk away with it."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think any of the three-year-olds would have a chance with him?\r\nA Derby winner with seven stone on his back might beat him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but nothing short of that. Even then old Ben would make a race of\r\nit. A nailing good horse once. A little brown horse about fifteen two, as\r\ncompact as a leg of Welsh mutton.... But there\'s no use in thinking of\r\nhim. They\'ve been trying for years to train him. Didn\'t they used to get\r\nthe flesh off him in a Turkish bath? That was Fulton\'s notion. He used to\r\nsay that it didn\'t matter \'ow you got the flesh off so long as you got it\r\noff. Every pound of flesh off the lungs is so much wind, he used to say.\r\nBut the Turkish bath trained horses came to the post limp as old rags. If\r\na \'orse \'asn\'t the legs you can\'t train him. Every pound of flesh yer take\r\noff must put a pound \'o \'ealth on. They\'ll do no good with old Ben, unless\r\nthey\'ve found out a way of growing on him a pair of new forelegs. The old\r\nones won\'t do for my money."\r\n\r\n"But do you think that Courtney will take the same view of his\r\ncapabilities as you do--do you think he\'ll let him off as easily as you\r\nhave?"\r\n\r\n"He can\'t give him much more.... The \'orse is bound to get in at seven\r\nstone, rather under than over."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to \'ear yer say so, for I know you\'ve a headpiece, and \'as all\r\nthe running in there." Stack tapped his forehead. "Now, I\'d like to ask\r\nyou if there\'s any three-year-olds that would be likely to interfere with\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"Derby and Leger winners will get from eight stone to eight stone ten, and\r\nthree-year-olds ain\'t no good over the Cesarewitch course with more than\r\neight on their backs."\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused. Surprised at Stack\'s silence, Journeyman said--\r\n\r\n"Is there anything up? Have you heard anything particular about old Ben?"\r\n\r\nStack bent forward. "Yes, I\'ve heard something, and I\'m making inquiries."\r\n\r\n"How did you hear it?"\r\n\r\nStack drew his chair a little closer. "I\'ve been up at Chalk Farm, the\r\n\'Yarborough Arms\'; you know, where the \'buses stop. Bob Barrett does a\r\ndeal of business up there. He pays the landlord\'s rent for the use of the\r\nbar--Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays is his days. Charley Grove bets\r\nthere Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, but it is Bob that does the\r\nbiggest part of the business. They say he\'s taken as much as twenty pounds\r\nin a morning. You know Bob, a great big man, eighteen stun if he\'s an\r\nounce. He\'s a warm \'un, can put it on thick."\r\n\r\n"I know him; he do tell fine stories about the girls; he has the pick of\r\nthe neighbourhood, wears a low hat, no higher than that, with a big brim.\r\nI know him. I\'ve heard that he \'as moved up that way. Used at one time to\r\nkeep a tobacconist\'s shop in Great Portland Street."\r\n\r\n"That\'s him," said Stack. "I thought you\'d heard of him."\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t many about that I\'ve not heard of. Not that I likes the man\r\nmuch. There was a girl I knew--she wouldn\'t hear his name mentioned. But\r\nhe lays fair prices, and does, I believe, a big trade."\r\n\r\n"\'As a nice \'ome at Brixton, keeps a trap; his wife as pretty a woman as\r\nyou could wish to lay eyes on. I\'ve seen her with him at Kempton."\r\n\r\n"You was up there this morning?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t Bob Barrett that gave you the tip?"\r\n\r\n"Not likely." The men laughed, and then Stack said--\r\n\r\n"You know Bill Evans? You\'ve seen him here, always wore a blue Melton\r\njacket and billycock hat; a dark, stout, good-looking fellow; generally\r\nhad something to sell, or pawn-tickets that he would part with for a\r\ntrifle."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know the fellow. We met him down at Epsom one Derby Day. Sarah\r\nTucker, a friend of the missis, was dead gone on him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she went to live with him. There was a row, and now, I believe,\r\nthey\'re together again; they was seen out walking. They\'re friends,\r\nanyhow. Bill has been away all the summer, tramping. A bad lot, but one of\r\nthem sort often hears of a good thing."\r\n\r\n"So it was from Bill Evans that you heard it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was from Bill. He has just come up from Eastbourne, where he \'as\r\nbeen about on the Downs a great deal. I don\'t know if it was the horses he\r\nwas after, but in the course of his proceedings he heard from a shepherd\r\nthat Ben Jonson was doing seven hours\' walking exercise a day. This seemed\r\nto have fetched Bill a bit. Seven hours a day walking exercise do seem a\r\nbit odd, and being at the same time after one of the servants in the\r\ntraining stable--as pretty a bit of goods as he ever set eyes on, so Bill\r\nsays--he thought he\'d make an inquiry or two about all this walking\r\nexercise. One of the lads in the stable is after the girl, too, so Bill\r\nfound out very soon all he wanted to know. As you says, the \'orse is dicky\r\non \'is forelegs, that is the reason of all the walking exercise."\r\n\r\n"And they thinks they can bring him fit to the post and win the\r\nCesarewitch with him by walking him all day?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say they don\'t gallop him at all; they do gallop him, but not as\r\nmuch as if his legs was all right."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t do. I don\'t believe in a \'orse winning the Cesarewitch that\r\nain\'t got four sound legs, and old Ben ain\'t got more than two."\r\n\r\n"He\'s had a long rest, and they say he is sounder than ever he was since\r\nhe won the Great Ebor. They don\'t say he\'d stand no galloping, but they\r\ndon\'t want to gallop him more than\'s absolutely necessary on account of\r\nthe suspensory ligament; it ain\'t the back sinew, but the suspensory\r\nligament. Their theory is this, that it don\'t so much matter about\r\nbringing him quite fit to the post, for he\'s sure to stay the course; he\'d\r\ndo that three times over. What they say is this, that if he gets in with\r\nseven stone, and we brings him well and three parts trained, there ain\'t\r\nno \'orse in England that can stand up before him. They\'ve got another in\r\nthe race, Laurel Leaf, to make the running for him; it can\'t be too strong\r\nfor old Ben. You say to yourself that he may get let off with six-seven.\r\nIf he do there\'ll be tons of money on him. He\'ll be backed at the post at\r\nfive to one. Before the weights come out they\'ll lay a hundred to one on\r\nthe field in any of the big clubs. I wouldn\'t mind putting a quid on him\r\nif you\'ll join me."\r\n\r\n"Better wait until the weights come out," said Journeyman, "for if it\r\nhappened to come to Courtney\'s ears that old Ben could be trained he\'d\r\nclap seven-ten on him without a moment\'s hesitation."\r\n\r\n"You think so?" said Stack.\r\n\r\n"I do," said Journeyman.\r\n\r\n"But you agree with me that if he got let off with anything less than\r\nseven stone, and be brought fit, or thereabouts, to the post, that the\r\nrace is a moral certainty for him?"\r\n\r\n"A thousand to a brass farthing."\r\n\r\n"Mind, not a word."\r\n\r\n"Is it likely?"\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused a moment, and Journeyman said, "You\'ve not seen my\r\n\'andicap for the Cambridgeshire. I wonder what you\'d think of that?" Stack\r\nsaid he would be glad to see it another time, and suggested that they go\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid the police is in," said Stack, when he opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Then we\'d better stop where we are; I don\'t want to be took to the\r\nstation."\r\n\r\nThey listened for some moments, holding the door ajar.\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t the police," said Stack, "but a row about some bet. Latch had\r\nbetter be careful."\r\n\r\nThe cause of the uproar was a tall young English workman, whose beard was\r\npale gold, and whose teeth were white. He wore a rough handkerchief tied\r\nround his handsome throat. His eyes were glassy with drink, and his\r\ncomrades strove to quieten him.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone," he exclaimed; "the bet was ten half-crowns to one. I\r\nwon\'t stand being welshed."\r\n\r\nWilliam\'s face flushed up. "Welshed!" he said. "No one speaks in this bar\r\nof welshing." He would have sprung over the counter, but Esther held him\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"I know what I\'m talking about; you let me alone," said the young workman,\r\nand he struggled out of the hands of his friends. "The bet was ten\r\nhalf-crowns to one."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind what he says, guv\'nor."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind what I says!" For a moment it seemed as if the friends were\r\nabout to come to blows, but the young man\'s perceptions suddenly clouded,\r\nand he said, "In this blo-ody bar last Monday... horse backed in\r\nTattersall\'s at twelve to one taken and offered."\r\n\r\n"He don\'t know what he\'s talking about; but no one must accuse me of\r\nwelshing in this \'ere bar."\r\n\r\n"No offence, guv\'nor; mistakes will occur."\r\n\r\nWilliam could not help laughing, and he sent Teddy upstairs for Monday\'s\r\npaper. He pointed out that eight to one was being asked for about the\r\nhorse on Monday afternoon at Tattersall\'s. The stage door-keeper and a\r\nscene-shifter had just come over from the theatre, and had managed to\r\nforce their way into the jug and bottle entrance. Esther and Charles had\r\nbeen selling beer and spirits as fast as they could draw it, but the\r\ndisputed bet had caused the company to forget their glasses.\r\n\r\n"Just one more drink," said the young man. "Take the ten half-crowns out\r\nin drinks, guv\'nor, that\'s good enough. What do you say, guv\'nor?"\r\n\r\n"What, ten half-crowns?" William answered angrily. "Haven\'t I shown you\r\nthat the \'orse was backed at Tattersall\'s the day you made the bet at\r\neight to one?"\r\n\r\n"Ten to one, guv\'nor."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not time to go on talking.... You\'re interfering with my business.\r\nYou must get out of my bar."\r\n\r\n"Who\'ll put me out?"\r\n\r\n"Charles, go and fetch a policeman."\r\n\r\nAt the word "policeman" the young man seemed to recover his wits somewhat,\r\nand he answered, "You\'ll bring in no bloody policeman. Fetch a policeman!\r\nand what about your blooming betting--what will become of it?" William\r\nlooked round to see if there was any in the bar whom he could not trust.\r\nHe knew everyone present, and believed he could trust them all. There was\r\nbut one thing to do, and that was to put on a bold face and trust to luck.\r\n"Now out you go," he said, springing over the counter, "and never you set\r\nyour face inside my bar again." Charles followed the guv\'nor over the\r\ncounter like lightning, and the drunkard was forced into the street. "He\r\ndon\'t mean no \'arm," said one of the friends; "he\'ll come round to-morrow\r\nand apologise for what he\'s said."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want his apology," said William. "No one shall call me a welsher\r\nin my bar.... Take your friend away, and never let me see him in my bar\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nSuddenly William turned very pale. He was seized with a fit of coughing,\r\nand this great strong man leaned over the counter very weak indeed. Esther\r\nled him into the parlour, leaving Charles to attend to the customers. His\r\nhand trembled like a leaf, and she sat by his side holding it. Mr. Blamy\r\ncame in to ask if he should lay one of the young gentlemen from the\r\ntutor\'s thirty shillings to ten against the favourite. Esther said that\r\nWilliam could attend to no more customers that day. Mr. Blamy returned ten\r\nminutes after to say that there was quite a number of people in the bar;\r\nshould he refuse to take their money?\r\n\r\n"Do you know them all?" said William.\r\n\r\n"I think so, guv\'nor."\r\n\r\n"Be careful to bet with no one you don\'t know; but I\'m so bad I can hardly\r\nspeak."\r\n\r\n"Much better send them away," said Esther.\r\n\r\n"Then they\'ll go somewhere else."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t matter; they\'ll come back to where they\'re sure of their money."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure of that," William answered, feebly. "I think it will be\r\nall right, Teddy; you\'ll be very careful."\r\n\r\n"Yes, guv\'nor, I\'ll keep down the price."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Fred Parsons came into the bar of the "King\'s Head." He wore\r\nthe cap and jersey of the Salvation Army; he was now Captain Parsons. The\r\nbars were empty. It was a time when business was slackest. The morning\'s\r\nbetting was over; the crowd had dispersed, and would not collect again\r\nuntil the _Evening Standard_ had come in. William had gone for a walk.\r\nEsther and the potboy were alone in the house. The potman was at work in\r\nthe backyard, Esther was sewing in the parlour. Hearing steps, she went\r\ninto the bar. Fred looked at her abashed, he was a little perplexed. He\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Is your husband in? I should like to speak to him."\r\n\r\n"No, my husband is out. I don\'t expect him back for an hour or so. Can I\r\ngive him any message?"\r\n\r\nShe was on the point of asking him how he was. But there was something so\r\nharsh and formal in his tone and manner that she refrained. But the idea\r\nin her mind must have expressed itself in her face, for suddenly his\r\nmanner softened. He drew a deep breath, and passed his hand across his\r\nforehead. Then, putting aside the involuntary thought, he said--\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it will come through you as well as any other way. I had intended\r\nto speak to him, but I can explain the matter better to you.... It is\r\nabout the betting that is being carried on here. We mean to put a stop to\r\nit. That\'s what I came to tell him. It must be put a stop to. No\r\nright-minded person--it cannot be allowed to go on."\r\n\r\nEsther said nothing; not a change of expression came upon her grave face.\r\nFred was agitated. The words stuck in his throat, and his hands were\r\nrestless. Esther raised her calm eyes, and looked at him. His eyes were\r\npale, restless eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come to warn you," he said, "that the law will be set in motion....\r\nIt is very painful for me, but something must be done. The whole\r\nneighbourhood is devoured by it." Esther did not answer, and he said, "Why\r\ndon\'t you answer, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"What is there for me to answer? You tell me that you are going to get up\r\na prosecution against us. I can\'t prevent you. I\'ll tell my husband what\r\nyou say."\r\n\r\n"This is a very serious matter, Esther." He had come into command of his\r\nvoice, and he spoke with earnest determination. "If we get a conviction\r\nagainst you for keeping a betting-house, you will not only be heavily\r\nfined, but you will also lose your licence. All we ask is that the betting\r\nshall cease. No," he said, interrupting, "don\'t deny anything; it is quite\r\nuseless, we know everything. The whole neighbourhood is demoralized by\r\nthis betting; nothing is thought of but tips; the day\'s racing--that is\r\nall they think about--the evening papers, and the latest information. You\r\ndo not know what harm you\'re doing. Every day we hear of some new\r\nmisfortune--a home broken up, the mother in the workhouse, the daughter on\r\nthe streets, the father in prison, and all on account of this betting. Oh,\r\nEsther, it is horrible; think of the harm you\'re doing."\r\n\r\nFred Parsons\' high, round forehead, his weak eyes, his whole face, was\r\nexpressive of fear and hatred of the evil which a falsetto voice denounced\r\nwith much energy.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he seemed to grow nervous and perplexed. Esther was looking at\r\nhim, and he said, "You don\'t answer, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"What would you have me answer?"\r\n\r\n"You used to be a good, religious woman. Do you remember how we used to\r\nspeak when we used to go for walks together, when you were in service in\r\nthe Avondale road? I remember you agreeing with me that much good could be\r\ndone by those who were determined to do it. You seem to have changed very\r\nmuch since those days."\r\n\r\nFor a moment Esther seemed affected by these remembrances. Then she said\r\nin a low, musical voice--\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve not changed, Fred, but things has turned out different. One\r\ndoesn\'t do the good that one would like to in the world; one has to do the\r\ngood that comes to one to do. I\'ve my husband and my boy to look to.\r\nThem\'s my good. At least, that\'s how I sees things."\r\n\r\nFred looked at Esther, and his eyes expressed all the admiration and love\r\nthat he felt for her character. "One owes a great deal," he said, "to\r\nthose who are near to one, but not everything; even for their sakes one\r\nshould not do wrong to others, and you must see that you are doing a great\r\nwrong to your fellow-creatures by keeping on this betting. Public-houses\r\nare bad enough, but when it comes to gambling as well as drink, there\'s\r\nnothing for us to do but to put the law in motion. Look you, Esther, there\r\nisn\'t a shop-boy earning eighteen shillings a week that hasn\'t been round\r\nhere to put his half-crown on some horse. This house is the immoral centre\r\nof the neighbourhood. No one\'s money is refused. The boy that pawned his\r\nfather\'s watch to back a horse went to the \'King\'s Head\' to put his money\r\non. His father forgave him again and again. Then the boy stole from the\r\nlodgers. There was an old woman of seventy-five who got nine shillings a\r\nweek for looking after some offices; he had half-a-crown off her. Then the\r\nfather told the magistrate that he could do nothing with him since he had\r\ntaken to betting on horse-races. The boy is fourteen. Is it not shocking?\r\nIt cannot be allowed to go on. We have determined to put a stop to it.\r\nThat\'s what I came to tell your husband."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure," said Esther, and she bit her lips while she spoke, "that\r\nit is entirely for the neighbourhood that you want to get up the\r\nprosecution?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think there\'s any other reason, Esther? You surely don\'t think\r\nthat I\'m doing this because--because he took you away from me?"\r\n\r\nEsther didn\'t answer. And then Fred said, and there was pain and pathos in\r\nhis voice, "I am sorry you think this of me; I\'m not getting up the\r\nprosecution. I couldn\'t prevent the law being put in motion against you\r\neven if I wanted to.... I only know that it is going to be put in motion,\r\nso for the sake of old times I would save you from harm if I could. I came\r\nround to tell you if you did not put a stop to the betting you\'d get into\r\ntrouble. I have no right to do what I have done, but I\'d do anything to\r\nsave you and yours from harm."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for what I said. It was very good of you."\r\n\r\n"We have not any proofs as yet; we know, of course, all about the betting,\r\nbut we must have sworn testimony before the law can be set in motion, so\r\nyou\'ll be quite safe if you can persuade your husband to give it up."\r\nEsther did not answer. "It is entirely on account of the friendship I feel\r\nfor you that made me come to warn you of the danger. You don\'t bear me any\r\nill-will, Esther, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"No, Fred, I don\'t. I think I understand." The conversation paused again.\r\n"I suppose we have said everything." Esther turned her face from him. Fred\r\nlooked at her, and though her eyes were averted from him she could see\r\nthat he loved her. In another moment he was gone. In her plain and\r\nignorant way she thought on the romance of destiny. For if she had married\r\nFred her life would have been quite different. She would have led the life\r\nthat she wished to lead, but she had married William and--well, she must\r\ndo the best she could. If Fred, or Fred\'s friends, got the police to\r\nprosecute them for betting, they would, as he said, not only have to pay a\r\nheavy fine, but would probably lose their licence. Then what would they\r\ndo? William had not health to go about from race-course to race-course as\r\nhe used to. He had lost a lot of money in the last six months; Jack was at\r\nschool--they must think of Jack. The thought of their danger lay on her\r\nheart all that evening. But she had had no opportunity of speaking to\r\nWilliam alone, she had to wait until they were in their room. Then, as she\r\nuntied the strings of her petticoats, she said--\r\n\r\n"I had a visit from Fred Parsons this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the fellow you were engaged to marry. Is he after you still?"\r\n\r\n"No, he came to speak to me about the betting."\r\n\r\n"About the betting--what is it to do with him?"\r\n\r\n"He says that if it isn\'t stopped that we shall be prosecuted."\r\n\r\n"So he came here to tell you that, did he? I wish I had been in the bar."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you wasn\'t. What good could you have done? To have a row and\r\nmake things worse!"\r\n\r\nWilliam lit his pipe and unlaced his boots. Esther slipped on her\r\nnight-dress and got into a large brass bedstead, without curtains. On the\r\nchest of drawers Esther had placed the books her mother had given her, and\r\nWilliam had hung some sporting prints on the walls. He took his\r\nnight-shirt from the pillow and put it on without removing his pipe from\r\nhis mouth. He always finished his pipe in bed.\r\n\r\n"It is revenge," he said, pulling the bed-clothes up to his chin, "because\r\nI got you away from him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it is that; I did think so at first, and I said so."\r\n\r\n"What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He said he was sorry I thought so badly of him; that he came to warn us\r\nof our danger. If he had wanted to do us an injury he wouldn\'t have said\r\nnothing about it. Don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"It seems reasonable. Then what do you think they\'re doing it for?"\r\n\r\n"He says that keeping a betting-house is corruption in the neighbourhood."\r\n\r\n"You think he thinks that?"\r\n\r\n"I know he do; and there is many like him. I come of them that thinks like\r\nthat, so I know. Betting and drink is what my folk, the Brethren, holds as\r\nmost evil."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve forgot all about them Brethren?"\r\n\r\n"No, one never forgets what one\'s brought up in."\r\n\r\n"But what do you think now?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never said nothing about it. I don\'t believe in a wife interfering\r\nwith her husband; and business was that bad, and your \'ealth \'asn\'t been\r\nthe same since them colds you caught standing about in them betting rings,\r\nso I don\'t see how you could help it. But now that business is beginning\r\nto come back to us, it might be as well to give up the betting."\r\n\r\n"It is the betting that brings the business; we shouldn\'t take five pounds\r\na week was it not for the betting. What\'s the difference between betting\r\non the course and betting in the bar? No one says nothing against it on\r\nthe course; the police is there, and they goes after the welshers and\r\npersecutes them. Then the betting that\'s done at Tattersall\'s and the\r\nAlbert Club, what is the difference? The Stock Exchange, too, where\r\nthousands and thousands is betted every day. It is the old story--one law\r\nfor the rich and another for the poor. Why shouldn\'t the poor man \'ave his\r\n\'alf-crown\'s worth of excitement? The rich man can have his thousand\r\npounds\' worth whenever he pleases. The same with the public\r\n\'ouses--there\'s a lot of hypocritical folk that is for docking the poor\r\nman of his beer, but there\'s no one that\'s for interfering with them that\r\ndrink champagne in the clubs. It\'s all bloody rot, and it makes me sick\r\nwhen I think of it. Them hypocritical folk. Betting! Isn\'t everything\r\nbetting? How can they put down betting? Hasn\'t it been going on since the\r\nworld began? Rot, says I! They can just ruin a poor devil like me, and\r\nthat\'s about all. We are ruined, and the rich goes scot-free.\r\nHypocritical, mealy-mouthed lot. \'Let\'s say our prayers and sand\r\nthe sugar\'; that\'s about it. I hate them that is always prating out\r\nreligion. When I hears too much religion going about I says now\'s the time\r\nto look into their accounts."\r\n\r\nWilliam leaned out of bed to light his pipe from the candle on the\r\nnight-table.\r\n\r\n"There\'s good people in the world, people that never thinks but of doing\r\ngood, and do not live for pleasure."\r\n\r\n"\'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\' Esther. Their only pleasure\r\nis a bet. When they\'ve one on they\'ve something to look forward to;\r\nwhether they win or lose they \'as their money\'s worth. You know what I say\r\nis true; you\'ve seen them, how they look forward to the evening paper to\r\nsee how the \'oss is going on in betting. Man can\'t live without hope. It\r\nis their only hope, and I says no one has a right to take it from them."\r\n\r\n"What about their poor wives? Very little good their betting is to them.\r\nIt\'s all very well to talk like that, William, but you know, and you can\'t\r\nsay you don\'t, that a great deal of mischief comes of betting; you know\r\nthat once they think of it and nothing else, they neglect their work.\r\nThere\'s Stack, he\'s lost his place as porter; there\'s Journeyman, too,\r\nhe\'s out of work."\r\n\r\n"And a good thing for them; they\'ve done a great deal better since they\r\nchucked it."\r\n\r\n"For the time, maybe; but who says it will go on? Look at old John; he\'s\r\ngoing about in rags; and his poor wife, she was in here the other night, a\r\nterrible life she\'s \'ad of it. You says that no \'arm comes of it. What\r\nabout that boy that was \'ad up the other day, and said that it was all\r\nthrough betting? He began by pawning his father\'s watch. It was here that\r\nhe made the first bet. You won\'t tell me that it is right to bet with bits\r\nof boys like that."\r\n\r\n"The horse he backed with me won."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse.... The boy\'ll never do another honest day\'s work as\r\nlong as he lives.... When they win, they \'as a drink for luck; when they\r\nloses, they \'as a drink to cheer them up."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, Esther, you ought to have married the other chap. He\'d have\r\ngiven you the life that you\'d have been happy in. This public-\'ouse ain\'t\r\nsuited to you."\r\n\r\nEsther turned round and her eyes met her husband\'s. There was a strange\r\nremoteness in his look, and they seemed very far from each other.\r\n\r\n"I was brought up to think so differently," she said, her thoughts going\r\nback to her early years in the little southern seaside home. "I suppose\r\nthis betting and drinking will always seem to me sinful and wicked. I\r\nshould \'ave liked quite a different kind of life, but we don\'t choose our\r\nlives, we just makes the best of them. You was the father of my child, and\r\nit all dates from that."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it do."\r\n\r\nWilliam lay on his back, and blew the smoke swiftly from his mouth.\r\n\r\n"If you smoke much more we shan\'t be able to breathe in this room."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t smoke no more. Shall I blow the candle out?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you like."\r\n\r\nWhen the room was in darkness, just before they settled their faces on the\r\npillow for sleep, William said--\r\n\r\n"It was good of that fellow to come and warn us. I must be very careful\r\nfor the future with whom I bet."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, as soon as dinner was over, Esther had intended to go to East\r\nDulwich to see Mrs. Lewis. But as she closed the door behind her, she saw\r\nSarah coming up the street.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see you\'re going out."\r\n\r\n"It don\'t matter; won\'t you come in, if it\'s only for a minute?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, I won\'t keep you. But which way are you going? We might go\r\na little way together."\r\n\r\nThey walked down Waterloo Place and along Pall Mall. In Trafalgar Square\r\nthere was a demonstration, and Sarah lingered in the crowd so long that\r\nwhen they arrived at Charing Cross, Esther found that she could not get to\r\nLudgate Hill in time to catch her train, so they went into the Embankment\r\nGardens. It had been raining, and the women wiped the seats with their\r\nhandkerchiefs before sitting down. There was no fashion to interest them,\r\nand the band sounded foolish in the void of the grey London Sunday.\r\nSarah\'s chatter was equally irrelevant, and Esther wondered how Sarah\r\ncould talk so much about nothing, and regretted her visit to East Dulwich\r\nmore and more. Suddenly Bill\'s name came into the conversation.\r\n\r\n"But I thought you didn\'t see him any more; you promised us you wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t help it.... It was quite an accident. One day, coming back\r\nfrom church with Annie--that\'s the new housemaid--he came up and spoke to\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He said, \'How are ye?... Who\'d thought of meeting you!\'"\r\n\r\n"And what did you say?"\r\n\r\n"I said I didn\'t want to have nothing to do with him. Annie walked on, and\r\nthen he said he was very sorry, that it was bad luck that drove him to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"And you believed him?"\r\n\r\n"I daresay it is very foolish of me. But one can\'t help oneself. Did you\r\never really care for a man?"\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting for an answer, Sarah continued her babbling chatter.\r\nShe had asked him not to come after her; she thought he was sorry for what\r\nhe had done. She mentioned incidentally that he had been away in the\r\ncountry and had come back with very particular information regarding a\r\ncertain horse for the Cesarewitch. If the horse won he\'d be all right.\r\n\r\nAt last Esther\'s patience was tired out.\r\n\r\n"It must be getting late," she said, looking towards where the sun was\r\nsetting. The river rippled, and the edges of the warehouses had\r\nperceptibly softened; a wind, too, had come up with the tide, and the\r\nwomen shivered as they passed under the arch of Waterloo Bridge. They\r\nascended a flight of high steps and walked through a passage into the\r\nStrand.\r\n\r\n"I was miserable enough with him; we used to have hardly anything to eat;\r\nbut I\'m more miserable away from him. Esther, I know you\'ll laugh at me,\r\nbut I\'m that heart-broken... I can\'t live without him... I\'d do anything\r\nfor him."\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t worth it."\r\n\r\n"That don\'t make no difference. You don\'t know what love is; a woman who\r\nhasn\'t loved a man who don\'t love her, don\'t. We used to live near here.\r\nDo you mind coming up Drury Lane? I should like to show you the house."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it will be out of our way."\r\n\r\n"No, it won\'t. Round by the church and up Newcastle Street.... Look,\r\nthere\'s a shop we used to go to sometimes. I\'ve eaten many a good sausage\r\nand onions in there, and that\'s a pub where we often used to go for a\r\ndrink."\r\n\r\nThe courts and alleys had vomited their population into the Lane. Fat\r\ngirls clad in shawls sat around the slum opening nursing their babies. Old\r\nwomen crouched in decrepit doorways, fumbling their aprons; skipping ropes\r\nwhirled in the roadway. A little higher up a vendor of cheap ices had set\r\nup his store and was rapidly absorbing all the pennies of the\r\nneighborhood. Esther and Sarah turned into a dilapidated court, where a\r\nhag argued the price of trotters with a family leaning one over the other\r\nout of a second-floor window. This was the block in which Sarah had lived.\r\nA space had been cleared by the builder, and the other side was shut in by\r\nthe great wall of the old theatre.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where we used to live," said Sarah, pointing up to the third\r\nfloor. "I fancy our house will soon come down. When I see the old place it\r\nall comes back to me. I remember pawning a dress over the way in the lane;\r\nthey would only lend me a shilling on it. And you see that shop--the\r\nshutters is up, it being Sunday; it is a sort of butcher\'s, cheap meat,\r\nlivers and lights, trotters, and such-like. I bought a bullock\'s heart\r\nthere, and stewed it down with some potatoes; we did enjoy it, I can tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nSarah talked so eagerly of herself that Esther had not the heart to\r\ninterrupt her. They made their way out into Catherine Street, and then to\r\nEndell Street, and then going round to St. Giles\' Church, they plunged\r\ninto the labyrinth of Soho.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m tiring you. I don\'t see what interest all this can be to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve known each other a long time."\r\n\r\nSarah looked at her, and then, unable to resist the temptation, she\r\ncontinued her narrative--Bill had said this, she had said that. She\r\nrattled on, until they came to the corner of Old Compton Street. Esther,\r\nwho was a little tired of her, held out her hand. "I suppose you must be\r\ngetting back; would you like a drop of something?"\r\n\r\n"It is going on for seven o\'clock; but since you\'re that kind I think I\'d\r\nlike a glass of beer."\r\n\r\n"Do you listen much to the betting talk here of an evening?" Sarah asked,\r\nas she was leaving.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t pay much attention, but I can\'t help hearing a good deal."\r\n\r\n"Do they talk much about Ben Jonson for the Cesarewitch?"\r\n\r\n"They do, indeed; he\'s all the go."\r\n\r\nSarah\'s face brightened perceptibly, and Esther said--\r\n\r\n"Have you backed him?\'\r\n\r\n"Only a trifle; half-a-crown that a friend put me on. Do they say he\'ll\r\nwin?"\r\n\r\n"They say that if he don\'t break down he\'ll win by \'alf a mile; it all\r\ndepends on his leg."\r\n\r\n"Is he coming on in the betting?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe they\'re now taking 12 to 1 about him. But I\'ll ask\r\nWilliam, if you like."\r\n\r\n"No, no, I only wanted to know if you\'d heard anything new."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next fortnight Sarah came several times to the "King\'s Head."\r\nShe came in about nine in the evening, and stayed for half-an-hour or\r\nmore. The ostensible object of her visit was to see Esther, but she\r\ndeclined to come into the private bar, where they would have chatted\r\ncomfortably, and remained in the public bar listening to the men\'s\r\nconversation, listening and nodding while old John explained the horse\'s\r\nstaying power to her. On the following evening all her interest was in\r\nKetley. She wanted to know if anything had happened that might be\r\nconsidered as an omen. She said she had dreamed about the race, but her\r\ndream was only a lot of foolish rubbish without head or tail. Ketley\r\nargued earnestly against this view of a serious subject, and in the hope\r\nof convincing her of her error offered to walk as far as Oxford Street\r\nwith her and put her into her \'bus. But on the following evening all her\r\ninterest was centered in Mr. Journeyman, who declared that he could prove\r\nthat according to the weight it seemed to him to look more and more like a\r\ncertainty. He had let the horse in at six stone ten pounds, the official\r\nhandicapper had only given him six stone seven pounds.\r\n\r\n"They is a-sending of him along this week, and if the leg don\'t go it is a\r\nhundred pound to a brass farthing on the old horse."\r\n\r\n"How many times will they gallop him?" Sarah asked.\r\n\r\n"He goes a mile and a \'arf every day now.... The day after to-morrow\r\nthey\'ll try him, just to see that he hasn\'t lost his turn of speed, and if\r\nhe don\'t break down in the trial you can take it from me that it will be\r\nall right."\r\n\r\n"When will you know the result of the trial?"\r\n\r\n"I expect a letter on Friday morning," said Stack. "If you come in in the\r\nevening I\'ll let you know about it."\r\n\r\n"Thank you very much, Mr. Stack. I must be getting home now."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going your way, Miss Tucker.... If you like, we\'ll go together, and\r\nI\'ll tell you," he whispered, "all about the \'orse."\r\n\r\nWhen they had left the bar the conversation turned on racing as an\r\noccupation for women.\r\n\r\n"Fancy my wife making a book on the course. I bet she\'d overlay it and\r\nthen turn round and back the favourite at a shorter price than she\'d been\r\nlaying."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that we should be any foolisher than you," said Esther;\r\n"don\'t you never go and overlay your book? What about Syntax and the \'orse\r\nyou told me about last week?"\r\n\r\nWilliam had been heavily hit last week through overlaying his book against\r\na horse he didn\'t believe in, and the whole bar joined in the laugh\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say nothing about bookmaking," said Journeyman; "but there\'s a\r\ngreat many women nowadays who is mighty sharp at spotting a \'orse that the\r\nhandicapper had let in pretty easy."\r\n\r\n"This one," said Ketley, jerking his thumb in the direction that Stack and\r\nSarah had gone, "seems to \'ave got hold of something."\r\n\r\n"We must ask Stack when he comes back," and Journeyman winked at William.\r\n\r\n"Women do get that excited over trifles," old John remarked,\r\nsarcastically. "She ain\'t got above \'alf-a-crown on the \'orse, if that.\r\nShe don\'t care about the \'orse or the race--no woman ever did; it\'s all\r\nabout some sweetheart that\'s been piling it on."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if you\'re right," said Esther, reflectively. "I never knew her\r\nbefore to take such an interest in a horse-race."\r\n\r\nOn the day of the race Sarah came into the private bar about three\r\no\'clock. The news was not yet in.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you like to step into the parlour; you\'ll be more comfortable?"\r\nsaid Esther.\r\n\r\n"No thank you, dear; it is not worth while. I thought I\'d like to know\r\nwhich won, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Have you much on?"\r\n\r\n"No, five shillings altogether.... But a friend of mine stands to win a\r\ngood bit. I see you\'ve got a new dress, dear. When did you get it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had the stuff by me some time. I only had it made up last month. Do\r\nyou like it?"\r\n\r\nSarah answered that she thought it very pretty. But Esther could see that\r\nshe was thinking of something quite different.\r\n\r\n"The race is over now. It\'s run at half-past two."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but they\'re never quite punctual; there may be a delay at the post."\r\n\r\n"I see you know all about it."\r\n\r\n"One never hears of anything else."\r\n\r\nEsther asked Sarah when her people came back to town, and was surprised at\r\nthe change of expression that the question brought to her friend\'s face.\r\n\r\n"They\'re expected back to-morrow," she said. "Why do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing; something to say, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused, and the two women looked at each other. At that\r\nmoment a voice coming rapidly towards them was heard calling, "Win-ner,\r\nwin-ner!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll send out for the paper," said Esther.\r\n\r\n"No, no... Suppose he shouldn\'t have won?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it won\'t make any difference."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Esther, no; some one will come in and tell us. The race can\'t be over\r\nyet; it is a long race, and takes some time to run."\r\n\r\nBy this time the boy was far away, and fainter and fainter the terrible\r\nword, "Win-ner, win-ner, win-ner."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late now," said Sarah; "some one\'ll come in presently and tell\r\nus about it.... I daresay it ain\'t the paper at all. Them boys cries out\r\nanything that will sell."\r\n\r\n"Win-ner, win-ner." The voice was coming towards them.\r\n\r\n"If he has won, Bill and I is to marry.... Somehow I feel as if he\r\nhasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Win-ner."\r\n\r\n"We shall soon know." Esther took a halfpenny from the till.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think we\'d better wait? It can\'t be printed in the papers, not\r\nthe true account, and if it was wrong--" Esther didn\'t answer; she gave\r\nCharles the halfpenny; he went out, and in a few minutes came back with\r\nthe paper in his hand. "Tornado first, Ben Jonson second, Woodcraft\r\nthird," he read out. "That\'s a good thing for the guv\'nor. There was very\r\nfew what backed Tornado.... He\'s only lost some place-money."\r\n\r\n"So he was only second," said Sarah, turning deadly pale. "They said he\r\nwas certain to win."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ve not lost much," said Esther. "It wasn\'t with William that\r\nyou backed him."\r\n\r\n"No, it wasn\'t with William. I only had a few shillings on. It don\'t\r\nmatter. Let me have a drink."\r\n\r\n"What will you have?"\r\n\r\n"Some whisky."\r\n\r\nSarah drank it neat. Esther looked at her doubtfully.\r\n\r\nThe bars would be empty for the next two hours; Esther wished to utilize\r\nthis time; she had some shopping to do, and asked Sarah to come with her.\r\nBut Sarah complained of being tired, and said she would see her when she\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\nEsther went out a little perplexed. She was detained longer than she\r\nexpected, and when she returned Sarah was staggering about in the\r\nbar-room, asking Charles for one more drink.\r\n\r\n"All bloody rot; who says I\'m drunk? I ain\'t... look at me. The \'orse did\r\nnot win, did he? I say he did; papers all so much bloody rot."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sarah, what is this?"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s this? Leave go, I say."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Stack, won\'t you ask her to come upstairs?... Don\'t encourage her."\r\n\r\n"Upstairs? I\'m a free woman. I don\'t want to go upstairs. I\'m a free\r\nwoman; tell me," she said, balancing herself with difficulty and staring\r\nat Esther with dull, fishy eyes, "tell me if I\'m not a free woman? What do\r\nI want upstairs for?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sarah, come upstairs and lie down. Don\'t go out."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going home. Hands off, hands off!" she said, slapping Esther\'s hands\r\nfrom her arm.\r\n\r\n"\'For every one was drunk last night,\r\nAnd drunk the night before;\r\nAnd if we don\'t get drunk to-night,\r\nWe don\'t get drunk no more.\r\n\r\n(Chorus.)\r\n\r\n"\'Now you will have a drink with me,\r\nAnd I will drink with you;\r\nFor we\'re the very rowdiest lot\r\nOf the rowdy Irish crew.\'\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we used to sing in the Lane, yer know; should \'ave seen the\r\ncoster gals with their feathers, dancing and clinking their pewters.\r\nRippin Day, Bank \'oliday, Epping, under the trees--\'ow they did romp,\r\nthem gals!\r\n\r\n"\'We all was roaring drunk last night,\r\nAnd drunk the night before;\r\nAnd if we don\'t get drunk to-night,\r\nWe won\'t get drunk no more.\'\r\n\r\n"Girls and boys, you know, all together."\r\n\r\n"Sarah, listen to me."\r\n\r\n"Listen! Come and have a drink, old gal, just another drink." She\r\nstaggered up to the counter. "One more, just for luck; do yer \'ear?"\r\nBefore Charles could stop her she had seized the whisky that had just been\r\nserved. "That\'s my whisky," exclaimed Journeyman. He made a rapid\r\nmovement, but was too late. Sarah had drained the glass and stood vacantly\r\nlooking into space. Journeyman seemed so disconcerted at the loss of his\r\nwhisky that every one laughed.\r\n\r\nA few moments after Sarah staggered forward and fell insensible into his\r\narms. He and Esther carried her upstairs and laid her on the bed in the\r\nspare room.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll be precious bad to-morrow," said Journeyman.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how you could have gone on helping her," Esther said to\r\nCharles when she got inside the bar; and she seemed so pained that out of\r\ndeference to her feelings the subject was dropped out of the conversation.\r\nEsther felt that something shocking had happened. Sarah had deliberately\r\ngot drunk. She would not have done that unless she had some great trouble\r\non her mind. William, too, was of this opinion. Something serious must\r\nhave happened. As they went up to their room Esther said--\r\n\r\n"It is all the fault of this betting. The neighbourhood is completely\r\nruined. They\'re losing their \'omes and their furniture, and you\'ll bear\r\nthe blame of it."\r\n\r\n"It do make me so wild to hear you talkin\' that way, Esther. People will\r\nbet, you can\'t stop them. I lays fair prices, and they\'re sure of their\r\nmoney. Yet you says they\'re losin\' their furniture, and that I shall have\r\nto bear the blame."\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the top of the stairs she said--\r\n\r\n"I must go and see how Sarah is."\r\n\r\n"Where am I? What\'s happened?... Take that candle out of my eyes.... Oh,\r\nmy head is that painful." She fell back on the pillow, and Esther thought\r\nshe had gone to sleep again. But she opened her eyes. "Where am I?\r\n...That\'s you, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Can\'t you remember?"\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t. I remember that the \'orse didn\'t win, but don\'t remember\r\nnothing after.... I got drunk, didn\'t I? It feels like it."\r\n\r\n"The \'orse didn\'t win, and then you took too much. It\'s very foolish of\r\nyou to give way."\r\n\r\n"Give way! Drunk, what matter? I\'m done for."\r\n\r\n"Did you lose much?"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t what I lost, it was what I took. I gave Bill the plate to\r\npledge; it\'s all gone, and master and missis coming back tomorrow. Don\'t\r\ntalk about it. I got drunk so that I shouldn\'t think of it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sarah, I didn\'t think it was as bad as that. You must tell me all\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to think about it. They\'ll come soon enough to take me away.\r\nBesides, I cannot remember nothing now. My mouth\'s that awful--Give me a\r\ndrink. Never mind the glass, give me the water-bottle."\r\n\r\nShe drank ravenously, and seemed to recover a little. Esther pressed her\r\nto tell her about the pledged plate. "You know that I\'m your friend. You\'d\r\nbetter tell me. I want to help you out of this scrape."\r\n\r\n"No one can help me now, I\'m done for. Let them come and take me. I\'ll go\r\nwith them. I shan\'t say nothing."\r\n\r\n"How much is it in for? Don\'t cry like that," Esther said, and she took\r\nout her handkerchief and wiped Sarah\'s eyes. "How much is it in for?\r\nPerhaps I can get my husband to lend me the money to get it out."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no use trying to help me.... Esther, I can\'t talk about it now; I\r\nshall go mad if I do."\r\n\r\n"Tell me how much you got on it."\r\n\r\n"Thirty pounds."\r\n\r\nIt took a long time to undress her. Every now and then she made an effort,\r\nand another article of clothing was got off. When Esther returned to her\r\nroom William was asleep, and Esther took him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n"It is more serious than I thought," she shouted. "I want to tell you\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"What about it?" he said, opening his eyes.\r\n\r\n"She has pledged the plate for thirty pounds to back that \'orse."\r\n\r\n"What \'orse?"\r\n\r\n"Ben Jonson."\r\n\r\n"He broke down at the bushes. If he hadn\'t I should have been broke up.\r\nThe whole neighbourhood was on him. So she pledged the plate to back him.\r\nShe didn\'t do that to back him herself. Some one must have put her up to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was Bill Evans."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that blackguard put her up to it. I thought she\'d left him for good.\r\nShe promised us that she\'d never speak to him again."\r\n\r\n"You see, she was that fond of him that she couldn\'t help herself. There\'s\r\nmany that can\'t."\r\n\r\n"How much did they get on the plate?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty pounds."\r\n\r\nWilliam blew a long whistle. Then, starting up in the bed, he said, "She\r\ncan\'t stop here. If it comes out that it was through betting, it won\'t do\r\nthis house any good. We\'re already suspected. There\'s that old sweetheart\r\nof yours, the Salvation cove, on the lookout for evidence of betting being\r\ncarried on."\r\n\r\n"She\'ll go away in the morning. But I thought that you might lend her the\r\nmoney to get the plate out."\r\n\r\n"What! thirty pounds?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a deal of money, I know; but I thought that you might be able to\r\nmanage it. You\'ve been lucky over this race."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but think of all I\'ve lost this summer. This is the first bit of\r\nluck I\'ve had for a long while."\r\n\r\n"I thought you might be able to manage it."\r\n\r\nEsther stood by the bedside, her knee leaned against the edge. She seemed\r\nto him at that moment as the best woman in the world, and he said--\r\n\r\n"Thirty pounds is no more to me than two-pence-halfpenny if you wish it,\r\nEsther."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been an extravagant wife, have I?" she said, getting into bed\r\nand taking him in her arms. "I never asked you for money before. She\'s my\r\nfriend--she\'s yours too--we\'ve known her all our lives. We can\'t see her\r\ngo to prison, can we, Bill, without raising a finger to save her?"\r\n\r\nShe had never called him Bill before, and the familiar abbreviation\r\ntouched him, and he said--\r\n\r\n"I owe everything to you, Esther; everything that\'s mine is yours. But,"\r\nhe said, drawing away so that he might see her better, "what do you say if\r\nI ask something of you?"\r\n\r\n"What are you going to ask me?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to say that you won\'t bother me no more about the betting. You\r\nwas brought up to think it wicked. I know all that, but you see we can\'t\r\ndo without it."\r\n\r\n"Do you think not?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t the thirty pounds you\'re asking for Sarah come out of betting?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose it do."\r\n\r\n"Most certainly it do."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help feeling, Bill, that we shan\'t always be so lucky as we have\r\nbeen."\r\n\r\n"You mean that you think that one of these days we shall have the police\r\ndown upon us?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you sometimes think that we can\'t always go on without being\r\ncaught? Every day I hear of the police being down on some betting club or\r\nother."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve been down on a great number lately, but what can I do? We always\r\ncome back to that. I haven\'t the health to work round from race-course to\r\nrace-course as I used to. But I\'ve got an idea, Esther. I\'ve been thinking\r\nover things a great deal lately, and--give me my pipe--there, it\'s just by\r\nyou. Now, hold the candle, like a good girl."\r\n\r\nWilliam pulled at his pipe until it was fully lighted. He threw himself on\r\nhis back, and then he said--\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been thinking things over. The betting \'as brought us a nice bit of\r\ntrade here. If we can work up the business a bit more we might, let\'s say\r\nin a year from now, be able to get as much for the \'ouse as we gave....\r\nWhat do you think of buying a business in the country, a \'ouse doing a\r\nsteady trade? I\'ve had enough of London, the climate don\'t suit me as it\r\nused to. I fancy I should be much better in the country, somewhere on the\r\nSouth Coast. Bournemouth way, what do you think?"\r\n\r\nBefore Esther could reply William was taken with a fit of coughing, and\r\nhis great broad frame was shaken as if it were so much paper.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure," said Esther, when he had recovered himself a little, "that a\r\ngood deal of your trouble comes from that pipe. It\'s never out of your\r\nmouth.... I feel like choking myself."\r\n\r\n"I daresay I smoke too much.... I\'m not the man I was. I can feel it plain\r\nenough. Put my pipe down and blow out the candle.... I didn\'t ask you how\r\nSarah was."\r\n\r\n"Very bad. She was half dazed and didn\'t tell me much."\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t tell you where she had pledged the plate?"\r\n\r\n"No, I will ask her about that to-morrow morning." Leaning forward she\r\nblew out the candle. The wick smouldered red for a moment, and they fell\r\nasleep happy in each other\'s love, seeming to find new bonds of union in\r\npity for their friend\'s misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\n"Sarah, you must make an effort and try to dress yourself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do feel that bad, I wish I was dead!"\r\n\r\n"You must not give way like that; let me help you put on your stockings."\r\n\r\nSarah looked at Esther. "You\'re very good to me, but I can manage." When\r\nshe had drawn on her stockings her strength was exhausted, and she fell\r\nback on the pillow.\r\n\r\nEsther waited a few minutes. "Here\'re your petticoats. Just tie them round\r\nyou; I\'ll lend you a dressing-gown and a pair of slippers."\r\n\r\nWilliam was having breakfast in the parlour. "Well, feeling a bit poorly?"\r\nhe said to Sarah. "What\'ll you have? There\'s a nice bit of fried fish. Not\r\nfeeling up to it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! I couldn\'t touch anything." She let herself drop on the sofa.\r\n\r\n"A cup of tea\'ll do you good," said Esther. "You must have a cup of tea,\r\nand a bit of toast just to nibble. William, pour her out a cup of tea."\r\n\r\nWhen she had drunk the tea she said she felt a little better.\r\n\r\n"Now," said William, "let\'s \'ear all about it. Esther has told you, no\r\ndoubt, that we intend to do all we can to help you."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t help me.... I\'m done for," she replied dolefully.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that," said William. "You gave that brute Bill Evans\r\nthe plate to pawn, so far as I know."\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t much more to tell. He said the horse was sure to win. He was\r\nat thirty to one at that time. A thousand to thirty. Bill said with that\r\nmoney we could buy a public-house in the country. He wanted to settle\r\ndown, he wanted to get out of--I don\'t want to say nothing against him. He\r\nsaid if I would only give him this chance of leading a respectable life,\r\nwe was to be married immediately after."\r\n\r\n"He told you all that, did he? He said he\'d give you a \'ome of your own, I\r\nknow. A regular rotter; that man is about as bad as they make \'em. And you\r\nbelieved it all?"\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t so much what I believed as what I couldn\'t help myself. He had\r\ngot that influence over me that my will wasn\'t my own. I don\'t know how it\r\nis--I suppose men have stronger natures than women. I \'ardly knew what I\r\nwas doing; it was like sleep-walking. He looked at me and said, \'You\'d\r\nbetter do it.\' I did it, and I suppose I\'ll have to go to prison for it.\r\nWhat I says is just the truth, but no one believes tales like that. How\r\nlong do you think they\'ll give me?"\r\n\r\n"I hope we shall be able to get you out of this scrape. You got thirty\r\npounds on the plate. Esther has told you that I\'m ready to lend you the\r\nmoney to get it out."\r\n\r\n"Will you do this? You\'re good friends indeed.... But I shall never be\r\nable to pay you back such a lot of money."\r\n\r\n"We won\'t say nothing about paying back; all we want you to do is to say\r\nthat you\'ll never see that fellow again."\r\n\r\nA change of expression came over Sarah\'s face, and William said, "You\'re\r\nsurely not still hankering after him?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed I\'m not. But whenever I meets him he somehow gets his way with\r\nme. It\'s terrible to love a man as I love him. I know he don\'t really care\r\nfor me--I know he is all you say, and yet I can\'t help myself. It is\r\nbetter to be honest with you."\r\n\r\nWilliam looked puzzled. At the end of a long silence he said, "If it\'s\r\nlike that I don\'t see that we can do anything."\r\n\r\n"Have patience, William. Sarah don\'t know what she\'s saying. She\'ll\r\npromise not to see him again."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind to me. I know I\'m very foolish. I promised before not to\r\nsee him, and I couldn\'t keep my promise."\r\n\r\n"You can stop with us until you get a situation in the country," said\r\nEsther, "where you\'ll be out of his way."\r\n\r\n"I might do that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to part with my money," said William, "if it is to do no one\r\nany good." Esther looked at him, and he added, "It is just as Esther\r\nwishes, of course; I\'m not giving you the money, it is she."\r\n\r\n"It is both of us," said Esther; "you\'ll do what I said, Sarah?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, anything you say, Esther," and she flung herself into her\r\nfriend\'s arms and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Now we want to know where you pawned the plate," said William.\r\n\r\n"A long way from here. Bill said he knew a place where it would be quite\r\nsafe. I was to say that my mistress left it to me; he said that would be\r\nsufficient.... It was in the Mile End Road."\r\n\r\n"You\'d know the shop again?" said William.\r\n\r\n"But she\'s got the ticket," said Esther.\r\n\r\n"No, I ain\'t got the ticket; Bill has it."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m afraid the game\'s up."\r\n\r\n"Do be quiet," said Esther, angrily. "If you want to get out of lending\r\nthe money say so and have done with it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not true, Esther. If you want another thirty to pay him to give up\r\nthe ticket, you can have it."\r\n\r\nEsther thanked her husband with one quick look. "I\'m sorry," she said, "my\r\ntemper is that hasty. But you know where he lives," she said, turning to\r\nthe wretched woman who sat on the sofa pale and trembling.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know where he lives--13 Milward Square, Mile End Road."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ve no time to lose; we must go after him at once."\r\n\r\n"No, William dear; you must not; you\'d only lose your temper, and he might\r\ndo you an injury."\r\n\r\n"An injury! I\'d soon show him which was the best man of the two."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not hear of it, Sarah. He mustn\'t go with you."\r\n\r\n"Come, Esther, don\'t be foolish. Let me go."\r\n\r\nHe had taken his hat from the peg. Esther got between him and the door.\r\n\r\n"I forbid it," she said; "I will not let you go--perhaps to have a fight,\r\nand with that cough."\r\n\r\nWilliam was coughing. He had turned pale, and he said, leaning against the\r\ntable, "Give me something to drink, a little milk."\r\n\r\nEsther poured some into a cup. He sipped it slowly. "I\'ll go upstairs,"\r\nshe said, "for my hat and jacket. You\'ve got your betting to attend to."\r\nWilliam smiled. "Sarah, mind, he\'s not to go with you."\r\n\r\n"You forget what you said last night about the betting."\r\n\r\n"Never mind what I said last night about the betting; what I say now is\r\nthat you\'re not to leave the bar. Come upstairs, Sarah, and dress\r\nyourself, and let\'s be off."\r\n\r\nStack and Journeyman were waiting to speak to him. They had lost heavily\r\nover old Ben and didn\'t know how they\'d pull through; and the whole\r\nneighbourhood was in the same plight; the bar was filled with gloomy\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nAnd as William scanned their disconcerted faces--clerks, hair-dressers,\r\nwaiters from the innumerable eating houses--he could not help thinking\r\nthat perhaps more than one of them had taken money that did not belong to\r\nthem to back Ben Jonson. The unexpected disaster had upset all their\r\nplans, and even the wary ones who had a little reserve fund could not help\r\nbacking outsiders, hoping by the longer odds to retrieve yesterday\'s\r\nlosses. At two the bar was empty, and William waited for Esther and Sarah\r\nto return from Mile End. It seemed to him that they were a long time away.\r\nBut Mile End is not close to Soho; and when they returned, between four\r\nand five, he saw at once that they had been unsuccessful. He lifted up the\r\nflap in the counter and all three went into the parlour.\r\n\r\n"He left Milward Square yesterday," Esther said. "Then we went to another\r\naddress, and then to another; we went to all the places Sarah had been to\r\nwith him, but no tidings anywhere."\r\n\r\nSarah burst into tears. "There\'s no more hope," she said. "I\'m done for;\r\nthey\'ll come and take me away. How much do you think I\'ll get? They won\'t\r\ngive me ten years, will they?"\r\n\r\n"I can see nothing else for you to do," said Esther, "but to go straight\r\nback to your people and tell them the whole story, and throw yourself on\r\ntheir mercy."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that she should say that she pawned the plate to get money to\r\nback a horse?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do."\r\n\r\n"It will make the police more keen than ever on the betting houses."\r\n\r\n"That can\'t be helped."\r\n\r\n"She\'d better not be took here," said William; "it will do a great deal of\r\nharm.... It don\'t make no difference to her where she\'s took, do it?"\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go away. I don\'t want to get no one into trouble," Sarah said, and\r\nshe got up from the sofa.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Charles opened the door, and said, "You\'re wanted in the\r\nbar, sir."\r\n\r\nWilliam went out quickly. He returned a moment after. There was a scared\r\nlook on his face. "They\'re here," he said. He was followed by two\r\npolicemen. Sarah uttered a little cry.\r\n\r\n"Your name is Sarah Tucker?" said the first policeman.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You\'re charged with robbery by Mr. Sheldon, 34, Cumberland Place."\r\n\r\n"Shall I be taken through the streets?"\r\n\r\n"If you like to pay for it, you can go in a cab," the police-officer\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go with you, dear," Esther said. William plucked her by the sleeve.\r\n"It will do no good. Why should you go?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magistrate of course sent the case for trial, and the thirty pounds\r\nwhich William had promised to give to Esther went to pay for the defence.\r\nThere seemed at first some hope that the prosecution would not be able to\r\nprove its case, but fresh evidence connecting Sarah with the abstraction\r\nof the plate was forthcoming, and in the end it was thought advisable that\r\nthe plea of not guilty should be withdrawn. The efforts of counsel were\r\ntherefore directed towards a mitigation of sentence. Counsel called Esther\r\nand William for the purpose of proving the excellent character that the\r\nprisoner had hitherto borne; counsel spoke of the evil influence into\r\nwhich the prisoner had fallen, and urged that she had no intention of\r\nactually stealing the plate. Tempted by promises, she had been persuaded\r\nto pledge the plate in order to back a horse which she had been told was\r\ncertain to win. If that horse had won, the plate would have been redeemed\r\nand returned to its proper place in the owner\'s house, and the prisoner\r\nwould have been able to marry. Possibly the marriage on which the prisoner\r\nhad set her heart would have turned out more unfortunate for the prisoner\r\nthan the present proceedings. Counsel had not words strong enough to\r\nstigmatise the character of a man who, having induced a girl to imperil\r\nher liberty for his own vile ends, was cowardly enough to abandon her in\r\nthe hour of her deepest distress. Counsel drew attention to the trusting\r\nnature of the prisoner, who had not only pledged her employer\'s plate at\r\nhis base instigation, but had likewise been foolish enough to confide the\r\npawn-ticket to his keeping. Such was the prisoner\'s story, and he\r\nsubmitted that it bore on the face of it the stamp of truth. A very sad\r\nstory, but one full of simple, foolish, trusting humanity, and, having\r\nregard to the excellent character the prisoner had borne, counsel hoped\r\nthat his lordship would see his way to dealing leniently with her.\r\n\r\nHis Lordship, whose gallantries had been prolonged over half a century,\r\nand whose betting transactions were matters of public comment, pursed up\r\nhis ancient lips and fixed his dead glassy eyes on the prisoner. He said\r\nhe regretted that he could not take the same view of the prisoner\'s\r\ncharacter as learned counsel had done. The police had made every effort to\r\napprehend the man Evans who, according to the prisoner\'s story, was the\r\nprincipal culprit. But the efforts of the police had been unavailing; they\r\nhad, however, found traces of the man Evans, who undoubtedly did exist,\r\nand need not be considered to be a near relative of our friend Mrs.\r\nHarris. And the little joke provoked some amusement in the court; learned\r\ncounsel settled their robes becomingly and leant forward to listen. They\r\nwere in for a humorous speech, and the prisoner would get off with a light\r\nsentence. But the grim smile waxed duller, and it was clear that lordship\r\nwas determined to make the law a terror to evil-doers. Lordship drew\r\nattention to the fact that during the course of their investigations the\r\npolice had discovered that the prisoner had been living for some\r\nconsiderable time with the man Evans, during which time several robberies\r\nhad been effected. There was no evidence, it was true, to connect the\r\nprisoner with these robberies. The prisoner had left the man Evans and had\r\nobtained a situation in the house of her present employers. When the\r\ncharacters she had received from her former employers were being examined\r\nshe had accounted for the year she had spent with the man Evans by saying\r\nthat she had been staying with the Latches, the publicans who had given\r\nevidence in her favour. It had also come to the knowledge of the police\r\nthat the man Evans used to frequent the "King\'s Head," that was the house\r\nowned by the Latches; it was probable that she had made there the\r\nacquaintance of the man Evans. The prisoner had referred her employers to\r\nthe Latches, who had lent their sanction to the falsehood regarding the\r\nyear she was supposed to have spent with them, but which she had really\r\nspent in cohabitation with a notorious thief. Here lordship indulged in\r\nsevere remarks against those who enabled not wholly irreproachable\r\ncharacters to obtain situations by false pretences, a very common habit,\r\nand one attended with great danger to society, one which society would do\r\nwell to take precautions to defend itself against.\r\n\r\nThe plate, his Lordship remarked, was said to have been pawned, but there\r\nwas nothing to show that it had been pawned, the prisoner\'s explanation\r\nbeing that she had given the pawn-ticket to the man Evans. She could not\r\ntell where she had pawned the plate, her tale being that she and the man\r\nEvans had gone down to Whitechapel together and pawned it in the Mile End\r\nRoad. But she did not know the number of the pawnbroker\'s, nor could she\r\ngive any indications as to its whereabouts--beyond the mere fact that it\r\nwas in the Mile End Road she could say nothing. All the pawnbrokers in the\r\nMile End Road had been searched, but no plate answering to the description\r\nfurnished by the prosecution could be found.\r\n\r\nLearned counsel had endeavoured to show that it had been in a measure\r\nunpremeditated, that it was the result of a passing but irresistible\r\ntemptation. Learned counsel had endeavoured to introduce some element of\r\nromance into the case; he had described the theft as the outcome of the\r\nprisoner\'s desire of marriage, but lordship could not find such purity of\r\nmotive in the prisoner\'s crime. There was nothing to show that there was\r\nany thought of marriage in the prisoner\'s mind; the crime was the result,\r\nnot of any desire of marriage, but rather the result of vicious passion,\r\nconcubinage. Regarding the plea that the crime was unpremeditated, it was\r\nonly necessary to point out that it had been committed for a distinct\r\npurpose and had been carried out in conjunction with an accomplished\r\nthief.\r\n\r\n"There is now only one more point which I wish to refer to, and that is\r\nthe plea that the prisoner did not intend to steal the plate, but only to\r\nobtain money upon it to enable her and the partner in her guilt to back a\r\nhorse for a race which they believed to be--" his Lordship was about to\r\nsay a certainty for him; he stopped himself, however, in time--"to be, to\r\nbe, which they believed him to be capable of winning. The race in question\r\nis, I think, called the Cesarewitch, and the name of the horse (lordship\r\nhad lost three hundred on Ben Jonson), if my memory serves me right (here\r\nlordship fumbled amid papers), yes, the name is, as I thought, Ben Jonson.\r\nNow, the learned counsel for the defence suggested that, if the horse had\r\nwon, the plate would have been redeemed and restored to its proper place\r\nin the pantry cupboards. This, I venture to point out, is a mere\r\nhypothesis. The money might have been again used for the purpose of\r\ngambling. I confess that I do not see why we should condone the prisoner\'s\r\noffence because it was committed for the sake of obtaining money for\r\ngambling purposes. Indeed, it seems to me a reason for dealing heavily\r\nwith the offence. The vice among the poorer classes is largely on the\r\nincrease, and it seems to me that it is the duty of all in authority to\r\ncondemn rather than to condone the evil, and to use every effort to stamp\r\nit out. For my part I fail to perceive any romantic element in the vice of\r\ngambling. It springs from the desire to obtain wealth without work, in\r\nother words, without payment; work, whether in the past or the present, is\r\nthe natural payment for wealth, and any wealth that is obtained without\r\nwork is in a measure a fraud committed upon the community. Poverty,\r\ndespair, idleness, and every other vice spring from gambling as naturally,\r\nand in the same profusion, as weeds from barren land. Drink, too, is\r\ngambling\'s firmest ally."\r\n\r\nAt this moment a certain dryness in his Lordship\'s throat reminded him of\r\nthe pint of excellent claret that lordship always drank with his lunch,\r\nand the thought enabled lordship to roll out some excellent invective\r\nagainst the evils of beer and spirits. And lordship\'s losses on the horse\r\nwhose name he could hardly recall helped to a forcible illustration of the\r\ntheory that drink and gambling mutually uphold and enforce each other.\r\nWhen the news that Ben Jonson had broken down at the bushes came in,\r\nlordship had drunk a magnum of champagne, and memory of this champagne\r\ninspired a telling description of the sinking feeling consequent on the\r\nloss of a wager, and the natural inclination of a man to turn to drink to\r\ncounteract it. Drink and gambling are growing social evils; in a great\r\nmeasure they are circumstantial, and only require absolute legislation to\r\nstamp them out almost entirely. This was not the first case of the kind\r\nthat had come before him; it was one of many, but it was a typical case,\r\npresenting all the familiar features of the vice of which he had therefore\r\nspoken at unusual length. Such cases were on the increase, and if they\r\ncontinued to increase, the powers of the law would have to be\r\nstrengthened. But even as the law stood at present, betting-houses,\r\npublic-houses in which betting was carried on, were illegal, and it was\r\nthe duty of the police to leave no means untried to unearth the offenders\r\nand bring them to justice. Lordship then glanced at the trembling woman in\r\nthe dock. He condemned her to eighteen months\' hard labour, and gathering\r\nup the papers on the desk, dismissed her for ever from his mind.\r\n\r\nThe court adjourned for lunch, and Esther and William edged their way out\r\nof the crowd of lawyers and their clerks. Neither spoke for some time.\r\nWilliam was much exercised by his Lordship\'s remarks on betting\r\npublic-houses, and his advice that the police should increase their\r\nvigilance and leave no means untried to uproot that which was the curse\r\nand the ruin of the lower classes. It was the old story, one law for the\r\nrich, another for the poor. William did not seek to probe the question any\r\nfurther, this examination seemed to him to have exhausted it; and he\r\nremembered, after all that the hypocritical judge had said, how difficult\r\nit would be to escape detection. When he was caught he would be fined a\r\nhundred pounds, and probably lose his licence. What would he do then? He\r\ndid not confide his fears to Esther. She had promised to say no more about\r\nthe betting; but she had not changed her opinion. She was one of those\r\nstubborn ones who would rather die than admit they were wrong. Then he\r\nwondered what she thought of his Lordship\'s speech. Esther was thinking of\r\nthe thin gruel Sarah would have to eat, the plank bed on which she would\r\nhave to sleep, and the miserable future that awaited her when she should\r\nbe released from gaol.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright winter\'s day; the City folk were walking rapidly, tightly\r\nbuttoned up in top-coats, and in a windy sky a flock of pigeons floated on\r\nstraightened wings above the telegraph wires. Fleet Street was full of\r\njournalists going to luncheon-bars and various eating-houses. Their hurry\r\nand animation were remarkable, and Esther noticed how laggard was\r\nWilliam\'s walk by comparison, how his clothes hung loose about him, and\r\nthat the sharp air was at work on his lungs, making him cough. She asked\r\nhim to button himself up more closely.\r\n\r\n"Is not that old John\'s wife?" Esther said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s her," said William. "She\'d have seen us if that cove hadn\'t\r\ngiven her the shilling.... Lord, I didn\'t think they was as badly off as\r\nthat. Did you ever see such rags? and that thick leg wrapped up in that\r\nawful stocking."\r\n\r\nThe morning had been full of sadness, and Mrs. Randal\'s wandering rags had\r\nseemed to Esther like a foreboding. She grew frightened, as the cattle do\r\nin the fields when the sky darkens and the storm draws near. She suddenly\r\nremembered Mrs. Barfield, and she heard her telling her of the unhappiness\r\nthat she had seen come from betting. Where was Mrs. Barfield? Should she\r\never see her again? Mr. Barfield was dead, Miss May was forced to live\r\nabroad for the sake of her health; all that time of long ago was over and\r\ndone with. Some words that Mrs. Barfield had said came back to her; she\r\nhad never quite understood them, but she had never quite forgotten them;\r\nthey seemed to chime through her life. "My girl," Mrs. Barfield had said,\r\n"I am more than twenty years older than you, and I assure you that time\r\nhas passed like a little dream; life is nothing. We must think of what\r\ncomes after."\r\n\r\n"Cheer up, old girl; eighteen months is a long while, but it ain\'t a\r\nlifetime. She\'ll get through it all right; and when she comes out we\'ll\r\ntry to see what we can do for her."\r\n\r\nWilliam\'s voice startled Esther from the depth of her dream; she looked at\r\nhim vaguely, and he saw that she had been thinking of something different\r\nfrom what he had suspected. "I thought it was on account of Sarah that you\r\nwas looking so sad."\r\n\r\n"No," she said, "I was not thinking of Sarah."\r\n\r\nThen, taking it for granted that she was thinking of the wickedness of\r\nbetting, his face darkened. It was aggravating to have a wife who was\r\nalways troubling about things that couldn\'t be helped. The first person\r\nthey saw on entering the bar was old John; and he sat in the corner of the\r\nbar on a high stool, his grey, death-like face sunk in the old unstarched\r\nshirt collar. The thin, wrinkled throat was hid with the remains of a\r\ncravat; it was passed twice round, and tied according to the fashions of\r\nfifty years ago. His boots were broken; the trousers, a grey, dirty brown,\r\nwere torn as high up as the ankle; they had been mended and the patches\r\nhardly held together; the frock coat, green with age, with huge flaps over\r\nthe pockets, frayed and torn, and many sizes too large, hung upon his\r\nstarveling body. He seemed very feeble, and there was neither light nor\r\nexpression in his glassy, watery eyes.\r\n\r\n"Eighteen months; a devil of a stiff sentence for a first offence," said\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\n"I just dropped in. Charles said you\'d sure to be back. You\'re later than\r\nI expected."\r\n\r\n"We stopped to have a bit of lunch. But you heard what I said. She got\r\neighteen months."\r\n\r\n"Who got eighteen months?"\r\n\r\n"Sarah."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Sarah. She was tried to-day. So she got eighteen months."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter? Wake up; you\'re half asleep. What will you have to\r\ndrink?"\r\n\r\n"A glass of milk, if you\'ve got such a thing."\r\n\r\n"Glass of milk! What is it, old man--not feeling well?"\r\n\r\n"Not very well. The fact is, I\'m starving."\r\n\r\n"Starving! ...Then come into the parlour and have something to eat. Why\r\ndidn\'t you say so before?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t like to."\r\n\r\nHe led the old chap into the parlour and gave him a chair. "Didn\'t like to\r\ntell me that you was as hard up as all that? What do you mean? You didn\'t\r\nuse to mind coming round for half a quid."\r\n\r\n"That was to back a horse; but I didn\'t like coming to ask for\r\nfood--excuse me, I\'m too weak to speak much."\r\n\r\nWhen old John had eaten, William asked how it was that things had gone so\r\nbadly with him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had terrible bad luck lately, can\'t get on a winner nohow. I have\r\nbacked \'orses that \'as been tried to win with two stone more on their\r\nbacks than they had to carry, but just because I was on them they didn\'t\r\nwin. I don\'t know how many half-crowns I\'ve had on first favourites. Then\r\nI tried the second favourites, but they gave way to outsiders or the first\r\nfavourites when I took to backing them. Stack\'s tips and Ketley\'s omens\r\nwas all the same as far as I was concerned. It\'s a poor business when\r\nyou\'re out of luck."\r\n\r\n"It is giving way to fancy that does for the backers. The bookmaker\'s\r\nadvantage is that he bets on principle and not on fancy."\r\n\r\nOld John told how unlucky he had been in business. He had been dismissed\r\nfrom his employment in the restaurant, not from any fault of his own, he\r\nhad done his work well. "But they don\'t like old waiters; there\'s always a\r\nlot of young Germans about, and customers said I smelt bad. I suppose it\r\nwas my clothes and want of convenience at home for keeping one\'s self\r\ntidy. We\'ve been so hard up to pay the three and sixpence rent which we\'ve\r\nowed, that the black coat and waistkit had to go to the pawnshop, so even\r\nif I did meet with a job in the Exhibition places, where they ain\'t so\r\nparticular about yer age, I should not be able to take it. It\'s terrible\r\nto think that I should have to come to this and after having worked round\r\nthe table this forty years, fifty pounds a year and all found, and\r\naccustomed always to a big footman and page-boy under me. But there\'s\r\nplenty more like me. It\'s a poor game. You\'re well out of it. I suppose\r\nthe end of it will be the work\'us. I\'m pretty well wore out, and--"\r\n\r\nThe old man\'s voice died away. He made no allusion to his wife. His\r\ndislike to speak of her was part and parcel of his dislike to speak of his\r\nprivate affairs. The conversation then turned on Sarah; the severity of\r\nthe sentence was alluded to, and William spoke of how the judge\'s remarks\r\nwould put the police on the watch, and how difficult it would be to\r\ncontinue his betting business without being found out.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt that it is most unfortunate," said old John.\r\n\r\n"The only thing for you to do is to be very particular about yer\r\nintroductions, and to refuse to bet with all who haven\'t been properly\r\nintroduced."\r\n\r\n"Or to give up betting altogether," said Esther.\r\n\r\n"Give up betting altogether!" William answered, his face flushed, and he\r\ngradually worked himself into a passion. "I give you a good \'ome, don\'t I?\r\nYou want for nothing, do yer? Well, that being so, I think you might keep\r\nyour nose out of your husband\'s business. There\'s plenty of\r\nprayer-meetings where you can go preaching if you like."\r\n\r\nWilliam would have said a good deal more, but his anger brought on a fit\r\nof coughing. Esther looked at him contemptuously, and without answering\r\nshe walked into the bar.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a bad cough of yours," said old John.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said William, and he drank a little water to pass it off. "I must\r\nsee the doctor about it. It makes one that irritable. The missis is in a\r\npretty temper, ain\'t she?"\r\n\r\nOld John did not reply; it was not his habit to notice domestic\r\ndifferences of opinion, especially those in which women had a share--queer\r\ncattle that he knew nothing about. The men talked for a long time\r\nregarding the danger the judge\'s remarks had brought the house into; and\r\nthey considered all the circumstances of the case. Allusion was made to\r\nthe injustice of the law, which allowed the rich and forbade the poor to\r\nbet; anecdotes were related, but nothing they said threw new light on the\r\nmatter in hand, and when Old John rose to go William summed up the\r\nsituation in these few words--\r\n\r\n"Bet I must, if I\'m to get my living. The only thing I can do is to be\r\ncareful not to bet with strangers."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how they can do nothing to you if yer makes that yer\r\nprinciple and sticks to it," said old John, and he put on the huge-rimmed,\r\ngreasy hat, three sizes too large for him, looking in his square-cut\r\ntattered frock-coat as queer a specimen of humanity as you would be likely\r\nto meet with in a day\'s walk. "If you makes that yer principle and sticks\r\nto it," thought William.\r\n\r\nBut practice and principle are never reduced to perfect agreement. One is\r\nalways marauding the other\'s territory; nevertheless for several months\r\nprinciple distinctly held the upper hand; William refused over and over\r\nagain to make bets with comparative strangers, but the day came when his\r\nprinciple relaxed, and he took the money of a man whom he thought was all\r\nright. It was done on the impulse of the moment, but the two half-crowns\r\nwrapped up in the paper, with the name of the horse written on the paper,\r\nhad hardly gone into the drawer than he felt that he had done wrong. He\r\ncouldn\'t tell why, but the feeling came across him that he had done wrong\r\nin taking the man\'s money--a tall, clean-shaven man dressed in broadcloth.\r\nIt was too late to draw back. The man had finished his beer and had left\r\nthe bar, which in itself was suspicious.\r\n\r\nThree days afterwards, between twelve and one, just the busiest time, when\r\nthe bar was full of people, there came a cry of "Police!" An effort was\r\nmade to hide the betting plant; a rush was made for the doors. It was all\r\ntoo late; the sergeant and a constable ordered that no one was to leave\r\nthe house; other police were outside. The names and addresses of all\r\npresent were taken down; search was made, and the packets of money and the\r\nbetting books were discovered. Then they all had to go to Marlborough\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day the following account was given in most of the daily\r\npapers:--"Raid on a betting man in the West End. William Latch, 35,\r\nlandlord of the \'King\'s Head,\' Dean Street, Soho, was charged that he,\r\nbeing a licensed person, did keep and use his public-house for the purpose\r\nof betting with persons resorting thereto. Thomas William, 35, billiard\r\nmarker, Gaulden Street, Battersea; Arthur Henry Parsons, 25, waiter,\r\nNorthumberland Street, Marylebone; Joseph Stack, 52, gentleman; Harold\r\nJourneyman, 45, gentleman, High Street, Norwood; Philip Hutchinson,\r\ngrocer, Bisey Road, Fulham; William Tann, piano-tuner, Standard Street,\r\nSoho; Charles Ketley, butterman, Green Street, Soho; John Randal, Frith\r\nStreet, Soho; Charles Muller, 44, tailor, Marylebone Lane; Arthur Bartram,\r\nstationer, East Street Buildings; William Burton, harness maker, Blue Lion\r\nStreet, Bond Street, were charged with using the \'King\'s Head\' for the\r\npurpose of betting. Evidence was given by the police regarding the room\r\nupstairs, where a good deal of drinking went on after hours. There had\r\nbeen cases of disorder, and the magistrate unfortunately remembered that a\r\nservant-girl, who had pledged her master\'s plate to obtain money to back a\r\nhorse, had been arrested in the \'King\'s Head.\' Taking these facts into\r\nconsideration, it seemed to him that he could not do less than inflict a\r\nfine of L100. The men who were found in Latch\'s house he ordered to be\r\nbound over."\r\n\r\nWho had first given information? That was the question. Old John sat\r\nsmoking in his corner. Journeyman leaned against the yellow-painted\r\npartition, his legs thrust out. Stack stood square, his dark,\r\ncrimson-tinted skin contrasting with sallow-faced little Ketley.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t the omens throw no light on this \'ere matter?" said Journeyman.\r\n\r\nKetley started from his reverie.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said William, "if I only knew who the b---- was."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t you got no idea of any sort?" said Stack.\r\n\r\n"There was a Salvation chap who came in some months ago and told my wife\r\nthat the betting was corrupting the neighbourhood. That it would have to\r\nbe put a stop to. It may \'ave been \'e."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t ask no one to bet with you. They does as they like."\r\n\r\n"Does as they like! No one does that nowadays. There\'s a temperance party,\r\na purity party, and a hanti-gambling party, and what they is working for\r\nis just to stop folk from doing as they like."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it," said Journeyman.\r\n\r\nStack raised his glass to his lips and said, "Here\'s luck."\r\n\r\n"There\'s not much of that about," said William. "We seem to be losing all\r\nround. I\'d like to know where the money goes. I think it is the \'ouse;\r\nit\'s gone unlucky, and I\'m thinking of clearing out."\r\n\r\n"We may live in a \'ouse a long while before we find what its luck really\r\nis," said Ketley. "I\'ve been in my old \'ouse these twenty years, and it\r\nain\'t nothing like what I thought it."\r\n\r\n"You are that superstitious," said Journeyman. "If there was anything the\r\nmatter with the \'ouse you\'d\'ve know\'d it before now."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t you doing the trade you was?" said Stack.\r\n\r\n"No, my butter and egg trade have fallen dreadful lately."\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused. It was Stack who broke the silence.\r\n\r\n"Do you intend to do no more betting \'ere?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"What, after being fined L100? You \'eard the way he went on about Sarah,\r\nand all on account of her being took here. I think he might have left\r\nSarah out."\r\n\r\n"It warn\'t for betting she took the plate," said Journeyman; "it was\r\n\'cause her chap said if she did he\'d marry her."\r\n\r\n"I wonder you ever left the course," said Stack.\r\n\r\n"It was on account of my \'ealth. I caught a dreadful cold at Kempton,\r\nstanding about in the mud. I\'ve never quite got over that cold."\r\n\r\n"I remember," said Ketley; "you couldn\'t speak above a whisper for two\r\nmonths."\r\n\r\n"Two months! more like three."\r\n\r\n"Fourteen weeks," said Esther.\r\n\r\nShe was in favour of disposing of the house and going to live in the\r\ncountry. But it was soon found that the conviction for keeping a\r\nbetting-house had spoiled their chance of an advantageous sale. If,\r\nhowever, the licence were renewed next year, and the business did not in\r\nthe meantime decline, they would be in a position to obtain better terms.\r\nSo all their energies should be devoted to the improvement of their\r\nbusiness. Esther engaged another servant, and she provided the best meat\r\nand vegetables that money could buy; William ordered beer and spirits of a\r\nquality that could be procured nowhere else in the neighbourhood; but all\r\nto no purpose. As soon as it became known that it was no longer possible\r\nto pass half a crown or a shilling wrapped up in a piece of paper across\r\nthe bar, their custom began to decline.\r\n\r\nAt last William could stand it no longer, and he obtained his wife\'s\r\npermission to once more begin book-making on the course. His health had\r\nbegun to improve with the spring weather, and there was no use keeping him\r\nat home eating his heart out with vexation because they were doing no\r\nbusiness. So did Esther reason, and it reminded her of old times when he\r\ncame back with his race-glasses slung round his shoulder. "Favourites all\r\nbeaten today; what have you got for me to eat, old girl?" Esther forgot\r\nher dislike of racing in the joy of seeing her husband happy, if he\'d only\r\npick up a bit of flesh; but he seemed to get thinner and thinner, and his\r\nfood didn\'t seem to do him any good.\r\n\r\nOne day he came home complaining that the ring was six inches of soft mud;\r\nhe was wet to the skin, and he sat shivering the whole evening, with the\r\nsensation of a long illness upon him. He was laid up for several weeks,\r\nand his voice seemed as if it would never return to him again. There was\r\nlittle or no occupation for him in the bar; and instead of laying he began\r\nto take the odds. He backed a few winners, it is true; but they could not\r\nrely on that. Most of their trade had slipped from them, so it did not\r\nmuch matter to them if they were found out. He might as well be hung for\r\nan old sheep as a lamb, and surreptitiously at first, and then more\r\nopenly, he began to take money across the bar, and with every shilling he\r\ntook for a bet another shilling was spent in drink. Custom came back in\r\nripples, and then in stronger waves, until once again the bar of the\r\n"King\'s Head" was full to overflowing. Another conviction meant ruin, but\r\nthey must risk it, so said William; and Esther, like a good wife,\r\nacquiesced in her husband\'s decision. But he took money only from those\r\nwhom he was quite sure of. He required an introduction, and was careful to\r\nmake inquiries concerning every new backer. "In this way," he said to\r\nKetley, "so long as one is content to bet on a small scale, I think it can\r\nbe kept dark; but if you try to extend your connection you\'re bound to\r\ncome across a wrong \'un sooner or later. It was that room upstairs that\r\ndid for me."\r\n\r\n"I never did think much of that room upstairs," said Ketley. "There was a\r\nsomething about it that I didn\'t like. Be sure you never bet in that jug\r\nand bottle bar, whatever you do. There\'s just the same look there as in\r\nthe room upstairs. Haven\'t you noticed it?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t say I\'ve, nor am I sure that I know exactly what you mean."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t see it, you don\'t see it; but it\'s plain enough to me, and\r\ndon\'t you bet with nobody standing in that bar. I wouldn\'t go in there for\r\na sovereign."\r\n\r\nWilliam laughed. He thought at first that Ketley was joking, but he soon\r\nsaw that Ketley regarded the jug and bottle entrance with real suspicion.\r\nWhen pressed to explain, he told Journeyman that it wasn\'t that he was\r\nafraid of the place, he merely didn\'t like it. "There\'s some places that\r\nyou likes better than others, ain\'t they?" Journeyman was obliged to\r\nconfess that there were.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, that\'s one of the places I don\'t like. Don\'t you hear a voice\r\ntalking there, a soft, low voice, with a bit of a jeer in it?"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he shaded his eyes and peered curiously into the\r\nleft-hand corner.\r\n\r\n"What are you looking at?" asked Journeyman.\r\n\r\n"At nothing that you can see," Ketley answered; and he drank his whisky as\r\nif lost in consideration of grave and difficult things. A few weeks later\r\nthey noticed that he always got as far from the jug and bottle entrance as\r\npossible, and he was afflicted with a long story concerning a danger that\r\nawaited him. "He\'s waiting; but nothing will happen if I don\'t go in\r\nthere. He can\'t follow me; he is waiting for me to go to him."\r\n\r\n"Then keep out of his way," said Journeyman. "You might ask your bloody\r\nfriend if he can tell us anything about the Leger."\r\n\r\n"I\'m trying to keep out of his way, but he\'s always watching and\r\na-beckoning of me."\r\n\r\n"Can you see him now?" asked Stack.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ketley; "he\'s a-sitting there, and he seems to say that if I\r\ndon\'t come to him worse will happen."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say nothing to him," William whispered to Journeyman. "I don\'t\r\nthink he\'s quite right in \'is \'ead; he\'s been losing a lot lately."\r\n\r\nOne day Journeyman was surprised to see Ketley sitting quite composedly in\r\nthe jug and bottle bar.\r\n\r\n"He got me at last; I had to go, the whispering got so loud in my head as\r\nI was a-coming down the street. I tried to get out into the middle of the\r\nstreet, but a drunken chap pushed me across the pavement, and he was at\r\nthe door waiting, and he said, \'Now, you\'d better come in; you know what\r\nwill happen if you don\'t.\'"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk rot, old pal; come round and have a drink with us."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t just at present--I may later on."\r\n\r\n"What do he mean?" said Stack.\r\n\r\n"Lord, I don\'t know," said Journeyman. "It\'s only his wandering talk."\r\n\r\nThey tried to discuss the chances of the various horses they were\r\ninterested in, but they could not detach their thoughts from Ketley, and\r\ntheir eyes went back to the queer little sallow-faced man who sat on a\r\nhigh stool in the adjoining bar paring his nails.\r\n\r\nThey felt something was going to happen, and before they could say the\r\nword he had plunged the knife deep into his neck, and had fallen heavily\r\non the floor. William vaulted over the counter. As he did so he felt\r\nsomething break in his throat, and when Stack and Journeyman came to his\r\nassistance he was almost as white as the corpse at his feet. Blood flowed\r\nfrom his mouth and from Ketley\'s neck in a deep stream that swelled into a\r\ngreat pool and thickened on the sawdust.\r\n\r\n"It was jumping over that bar," William replied, faintly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see to my husband," said Esther.\r\n\r\nA rush of blood cut short his words, and, leaning on his wife, he walked\r\nfeebly round into the back parlour. Esther rang the bell violently.\r\n\r\n"Go round at once to Doctor Green," she said; "and if he isn\'t in inquire\r\nwhich is the nearest. Don\'t come back without a doctor."\r\n\r\nWilliam had broken a small blood-vessel, and the doctor said he would have\r\nto be very careful for a long time. It was likely to prove a long case.\r\nBut Ketley had severed the jugular at one swift, keen stroke, and had died\r\nalmost instantly. Of course there was an inquest, and the coroner asked\r\nmany questions regarding the habits of the deceased. Mrs. Ketley was one\r\nof the witnesses called, and she deposed that he had lost a great deal of\r\nmoney lately in betting, and that he went to the "King\'s Head" for the\r\npurpose of betting. The police deposed that the landlord of the "King\'s\r\nHead" had been fined a hundred pounds for keeping a betting-house, and the\r\nforeman of the jury remarked that betting-houses were the ruin of the\r\npoorer classes, and that they ought to be put a stop to. The coroner added\r\nthat such places as the "King\'s Head" should not be licensed. That was the\r\nsimplest and most effectual way of dealing with the nuisance.\r\n\r\n"There never was no luck about this house," said William, "and what there\r\nwas has left us; in three months\' time we shall be turned out of it neck\r\nand crop. Another conviction would mean a fine of a couple of hundred, or\r\nmost like three months, and that would just about be the end of me."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll never license us again," said Esther, "and the boy at school and\r\ndoing so well."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Esther, to have brought this trouble on you. We must do the\r\nbest we can, get the best price we can for the \'ouse. I may be lucky\r\nenough to back a few winners. That\'s all there is to be said--the \'ouse\r\nwas always an unlucky one. I hate the place, and shall be glad to get out\r\nof it."\r\n\r\nEsther sighed. She didn\'t like to hear the house spoken ill of, and after\r\nso many years it did seem a shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\n\r\n\r\nEsther kept William within doors during the winter months. If his health\r\ndid not improve it got no worse, and she had begun to hope that the\r\nbreakage of the blood-vessel did not mean lung disease. But the harsh\r\nwinds of spring did not suit him, and there was business with his lawyer\r\nto which he was obliged to attend. A determined set was going to be made\r\nagainst the renewal of his licence, and he was determined to defeat his\r\nopponents. Counsel was instructed, and a great deal of money was spent on\r\nthe case. But the licence was nevertheless refused, and the north-east\r\nwind did not cease to rattle; it seemed resolved on William\'s death, and\r\nwith a sick husband on her hands, and all the money they had invested in\r\nthe house irreparably lost, Esther began to make preparations for moving.\r\n\r\nWilliam had proved a kind husband, and in the seven years she had spent in\r\nthe "King\'s Head" there had been some enjoyment of life. She couldn\'t say\r\nthat she had been unhappy. She had always disapproved of the betting. They\r\nhad tried to do without it. There was a great deal in life which one\r\ncouldn\'t approve of. But Ketley had never been very right in his head, and\r\nSarah\'s misfortune had had very little to do with the "King\'s Head." They\r\nhad all tried to keep her from that man; it was her own fault. There were\r\nworse places than the "King\'s Head." It wasn\'t for her to abuse it. She\r\nhad lived there seven years; she had seen her boy growing up--he was\r\nalmost a young man now, and had had the best education. That much good the\r\n"King\'s Head" had done. But perhaps it was no longer suited to William\'s\r\nhealth. The betting, she was tired thinking about that; and that constant\r\nnipping, it was impossible for him to keep from it with every one asking\r\nhim to drink with them. A look of fear and distress passed across her\r\nface, and she stopped for a moment....\r\n\r\nShe was rolling up a pair of curtains. She did not know how they were to\r\nlive, that was the worst of it. If they only had back the money they had\r\nsunk in the house she would not so much mind. That was what was so hard to\r\nbear; all that money lost, just as if they had thrown it into the river.\r\nSeven years of hard work--for she had worked hard--and nothing to show\r\nfor it. If she had been doing the grand lady all the time it would have\r\nbeen no worse. Horses had won and horses had lost--a great deal of trouble\r\nand fuss and nothing to show for it. That was what stuck in her throat.\r\nNothing to show for it. She looked round the dismantled walls, and\r\ndescended the vacant staircase. She would never serve another pint of beer\r\nin that bar. What a strong, big fellow he was when she first went to live\r\nwith him! He was sadly changed. Would she ever see him strong and well\r\nagain? She remembered he had told her that he was worth nearly L3000. She\r\nhadn\'t brought him luck. He wasn\'t worth anything like that to-day.\r\n\r\n"How much have we in the bank, dear?"\r\n\r\n"A bit over six hundred pounds. I was reckoning of it up yesterday. But\r\nwhat do you want to know for? To remind me that I\'ve been losing. Well, I\r\nhave been losing. I hope you\'re satisfied."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t thinking of such a thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you was, there\'s no use saying you wasn\'t. It ain\'t my fault if the\r\n\'orses don\'t win; I do the best I can."\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him. Then he said, "It\'s my \'ealth that makes me\r\nirritable, dear; you aren\'t angry, are you?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear, I know you don\'t mean it, and I don\'t pay no attention to it."\r\nShe spoke so gently that he looked at her surprised, for he remembered her\r\nquick temper, and he said, "You\'re the best wife a man ever had."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not, Bill, but I tries to do my best."\r\n\r\nThe spring was the harshest ever known, and his cough grew worse and the\r\nblood-spitting returned. Esther grew seriously alarmed. Their doctor spoke\r\nof Brompton Hospital, and she insisted on his going there to be examined.\r\nWilliam would not have her come with him; and she did not press the point,\r\nfearing to irritate him, but sat at home waiting anxiously for him to\r\nreturn, hoping against hope, for their doctor had told her that he feared\r\nvery long trouble. And she could tell from his face and manner that he had\r\nbad news for her. All her strength left her, but she conquered her\r\nweakness and said--\r\n\r\n"Now tell me what they said. I\'ve a right to know; I want to know."\r\n\r\n"They said it was consumption."\r\n\r\n"Oh, did they say that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but they don\'t mean that I\'m going to die. They said they hoped they\r\ncould patch me up; people often live for years with only half a lung, and\r\nit is only the left one that\'s gone."\r\n\r\nHe coughed slightly and wiped the blood from his lips. Esther was quite\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t look like that," he said, "or I shall fancy I\'m going to die\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"They said they thought that they could patch you up?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; they said I might go on a long while yet, but that I would never be\r\nthe man I was."\r\n\r\nThis was so obvious she could not check a look of pity.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re going to look at me like that I\'d sooner go into the hospital\r\nat once. It ain\'t the cheerfulest of places, but it will be better than\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry it was consumption. But if they said they could patch you up,\r\nit will be all right. It was a great deal for them to say."\r\n\r\nHer duty was to overcome her grief and speak as if the doctors had told\r\nhim that there was nothing the matter that a little careful nursing would\r\nfail to put right. William had faith in the warm weather, and she resolved\r\nto put her trust in it. It was hard to see him wasting away before her\r\neyes and keep cheerful looks in her face and an accent of cheerfulness in\r\nheir voice. The sunshine which had come at last seemed to suck up all the\r\nlife that was in him; he grew paler, and withered like a plant. Then\r\nill-luck seemed to have joined in the hunt; he could not "touch" a winner,\r\nand their fortune drained away with his life. Favourites and outsiders, it\r\nmattered not; whatever he backed lost; and Esther dreaded the cry\r\n"Win-ner, all the win-ner!" He sat on the little balcony in the sunny\r\nevenings looking down the back street for the boy to appear with the\r\n"special." Then she had to go and fetch the paper. On the rare occasions\r\nwhen he won, the spectacle was even more painful. He brightened up, his\r\nthin arm and hand moved nervously, and he began to make projects and\r\nindulge in hopes which she knew were vain.\r\n\r\nShe insisted, however, on his taking regularly the medicine they gave him\r\nat the hospital, and this was difficult to do. For his irritability\r\nincreased in measure as he perceived the medicine was doing him no good;\r\nhe found fault with the doctors, railed against them unjustly, and all the\r\nwhile the little; cough continued, and the blood-spitting returned at the\r\nend of cruel intervals, when he had begun to hope that at least that\r\ntrouble was done with. One morning he told his wife that he was going to\r\nask the doctors to examine him again. They had spoken of patching up; but\r\nhe wanted to know whether he was going to live or die. There was a certain\r\nrelief in hearing him speak so plainly; she had had enough of the torture\r\nof hope, and would like to know the worst. He liked better to go to the\r\nhospital alone, but she felt that she could not sit at home counting the\r\nminutes for him to return, and begged to be allowed to go with him. To her\r\nsurprise, he offered no opposition. She had expected that her request\r\nwould bring about quite a little scene, but he had taken it so much as a\r\nmatter of course that she should accompany him that she was doubly glad\r\nthat she had proposed to go with him; if she hadn\'t he might have accused\r\nher of neglecting him. She put on her hat; the day was too hot for a\r\njacket; it was the beginning of August; the town was deserted, and the\r\nstreets looked as if they were about to evaporate or lie down exhausted,\r\nand the poor, dry, dusty air that remained after the season was too poor\r\neven for Esther\'s healthy lungs; it made William cough, and she hoped the\r\ndoctors would order him to the seaside.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of their omnibus they could see right across the plateau of\r\nthe Green Park, dry and colourless like a desert; as they descended the\r\nhill they noticed that autumn was already busy in the foliage; lower down\r\nthe dells were full of fallen leaves. At Hyde Park Corner the blown dust\r\nwhirled about the hill-top; all along St. George\'s Place glimpses of the\r\nempty Park appeared through the railings. The wide pavements, the Brompton\r\nRoad, and a semi-detached public-house at the cross-roads, announced\r\nsuburban London to the Londoner.\r\n\r\n"You see," said William, "where them trees are, where the road turns off\r\nto the left. That \'ouse is the \'Bell and Horns.\' That\'s the sort of house\r\nI should like to see you in."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity we didn\'t buy it when we had the money."\r\n\r\n"Buy it! That \'ouse is worth ten thousand pounds if it\'s worth a penny."\r\n\r\n"I was once in a situation not far from here. I like the Fulham Road; it\'s\r\nlike a long village street, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\nHer first service was with Mrs. Dunbar, in Sydney Street, and she\r\nremembered the square church tower at the Chelsea end; a little further on\r\nthere was the Vestry Hall in the King\'s Road, and then Oakley Street on\r\nthe left, leading down to Battersea. Mrs. Dunbar used to go to some\r\ngardens at the end of the King\'s Road. Cremorne Gardens, that was the\r\nname; there used to be fire-works there, and she often spent the evening\r\nat the back window watching the rockets go up. That was just before Lady\r\nElwin had got her the situation as kitchen-maid at Woodview. She\r\nremembered the very shops--there was Palmer\'s the butterman, and there was\r\nHyde\'s the grocer\'s. Everything was just as she had left it. How many\r\nyears ago? Fifteen or sixteen. So enwrapped was she in memories that\r\nWilliam had to touch her. "Here we are," he said; "don\'t you remember the\r\nplace?"\r\n\r\nShe remembered very well that great red brick building, a centrepiece with\r\ntwo wings, surrounded by high iron railings lined with gloomy shrubs. The\r\nlong straight walks, the dismal trees arow, where pale-faced men walked or\r\nrested feebly, had impressed themselves on her young mind--thin, patient\r\nmen, pacing their sepulchre. She had wondered who they were, if they would\r\nget well; and then, quick with sensation of lingering death, she had\r\nhurried away on her errands. The low wooden yellow-painted gates were\r\nunchanged. She had never before seen them open, and it was new to her to\r\nsee the gardens filled with bright sunshine and numerous visitors. There\r\nwere flowers in the beds, and the trees were beautiful in their leafage. A\r\nlittle yellow was creeping through, and from time to time a leaf fell\r\nexhausted from the branches.\r\n\r\nWilliam, who was already familiar with the custom of the place, nodded to\r\nthe porter and was let pass without question. He did not turn to the\r\nprincipal entrance in the middle of the building, but went towards a side\r\nentrance. The house physician was standing near it talking with a young\r\nman whom Esther recognised as Mr. Alden. The thought that he, too, might\r\nbe dying of consumption crossed her mind, but his appearance and his\r\nhealthy, hearty laugh reassured her. A stout, common girl, healthy too,\r\ncame out of the building with a child, a little thing of twelve or\r\nthirteen, with death in her face. Mr. Alden stopped her, and in his\r\ncheerful, kind manner hoped the little one was better. She answered that\r\nshe was. The doctor bade him good-bye and beckoned William and Esther to\r\nfollow him. Esther would have liked to have spoken to Mr. Alden. But he\r\ndid not see her, and she followed her husband, who was talking with the\r\ndoctor, through the doorway into a long passage. At the end of the passage\r\nthere were a number of girls in print dresses. The gaiety of the dresses\r\nled Esther to think that they must be visitors. But the little cough\r\nwarned her that death was amongst them. As she went past she caught sight\r\nof a wasted form in a bath-chair. The thin hands were laid on the knees,\r\non a little handkerchief, and there were spots on the whiteness deeper\r\nthan the colour of the dress. They passed down another passage, meeting a\r\nsister on their way; pretty and discreet she was in her black dress and\r\nveil, and she raised her eyes, glancing affectionately at the young\r\ndoctor. No doubt they loved each other. The eternal love-story among so\r\nmuch death!\r\n\r\nEsther wished to be present at the examination, but a sudden whim made\r\nWilliam say that he would prefer to be alone with the doctor, and she\r\nreturned to the gardens. Mr. Alden had not yet gone. He stood with his\r\nback turned to her. The little girl she had seen him speaking to was\r\nsitting on a bench under the trees; she held in her hands a skein of\r\nyellow worsted which her companion was winding into a ball. Two other\r\nyoung women were with them and all four were smiling and whispering and\r\nlooking towards Mr. Alden. They evidently sought to attract his attention,\r\nand wished him to come and speak to them. Just the natural desire of women\r\nto please, and moved by the pathos of this poor coquetting, he went to\r\nthem, and Esther could see that they all wanted to talk to him. She too\r\nwould have liked to have spoken to him; he was an old friend. And she\r\nwalked up the grounds, intending to pass by him as she walked back. His\r\nback was still turned to her, and they were all so interested that they\r\ngave no heed to anything else. One of the young women had an exceedingly\r\npretty face. A small oval, perfectly snow-white, and large blue eyes\r\nshaded with long dark lashes; a little aquiline nose; and Esther heard her\r\nsay, "I should be well enough if it wasn\'t for the cough. It isn\'t no\r\nbetter since--" The cough interrupted the end of the sentence, and\r\naffecting to misunderstand her, Mr. Alden said--\r\n\r\n"No better than it was a week ago."\r\n\r\n"A week ago!" said the poor girl. "It is no better since Christmas."\r\n\r\nThere was surprise in her voice, and the pity of it took Mr. Alden in the\r\nthroat, and it was with difficulty that he answered that "he hoped that\r\nthe present fine weather would enable her to get well. Such weather as\r\nthis," he said, "is as good as going abroad."\r\n\r\nThis assertion was disputed. One of the women had been to Australia for\r\nher health, and the story of travel was interspersed by the little coughs,\r\nterrible in their apparent insignificance. But it was Mr. Alden that the\r\nothers wished to hear speak; they knew all about their companion\'s trip to\r\nAustralia, and in their impatience their eyes went towards Esther. So Mr.\r\nAlden became aware of a new presence, and he turned.\r\n\r\n"What! is it you, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"But there doesn\'t seem much the matter with you. You\'re all right."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m all right, sir; it\'s my husband."\r\n\r\nThey walked a few yards up the path.\r\n\r\n"Your husband! I\'m very sorry."\r\n\r\n"He\'s been an out-door patient for some time; he\'s being examined by the\r\ndoctors now."\r\n\r\n"Whom did you marry, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"William Latch, a betting man, sir."\r\n\r\n"You married a betting man, Esther? How curiously things do work out! I\r\nremember you were engaged to a pious young man, the stationer\'s foreman.\r\nThat was when you were with Miss Rice; you know, I suppose, that she\'s\r\ndead."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, I didn\'t know it. I\'ve had so much trouble lately that I\'ve not\r\nbeen to see her for nearly two years. When did she die, sir?"\r\n\r\n"About two months ago. So you married a betting man! Miss Rice did say\r\nsomething about it, but I don\'t think I understood that he was a betting\r\nman; I thought he was a publican."\r\n\r\n"So he was, sir. We lost our licence through the betting."\r\n\r\n"You say he\'s being examined by the doctor. Is it a bad case?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it is, sir."\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence until they reached the gate.\r\n\r\n"To me this place is infinitely pathetic. That little cough never silent\r\nfor long. Did you hear that poor girl say with surprise that her cough is\r\nno better than it was last Christmas?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Poor girl, I don\'t think she\'s long for this world."\r\n\r\n"But tell me about your husband, Esther," he said, and his face filled\r\nwith an expression of true sympathy. "I\'m a subscriber, and if your\r\nhusband would like to become an in-door patient, I hope you\'ll let me\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir; you was always the kindest, but there\'s no reason why I\r\nshould trouble you. Some friends of ours have already recommended him, and\r\nit only rests with himself to remain out or go in."\r\n\r\nHe pulled out his watch and said, "I am sorry to have met you in such sad\r\ncircumstances, but I\'m glad to have seen you. It must be seven years or\r\nmore since you left Miss Rice. You haven\'t changed much; you keep your\r\ngood looks."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir."\r\n\r\nHe laughed at her embarrassment and walked across the road hailing a\r\nhansom, just as he used to in old times when he came to see Miss Rice. The\r\nmemory of those days came back upon her. It was strange to meet him again\r\nafter so many years. She felt she had seen him now for the last time. But\r\nit was foolish and wicked, too, to think of such things; her husband\r\ndying.... But she couldn\'t help it; he reminded her of so much of what was\r\npast and gone. A moment after she dashed these personal tears aside and\r\nwalked open-hearted to meet William. What had the doctor said? She must\r\nknow the truth. If she was to lose him she would lose everything. No, not\r\neverything; her boy would still remain to her, and she felt that, after\r\nall, her boy was what was most real to her in life. These thoughts had\r\npassed through her mind before William had had time to answer her\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n"He said the left lung was gone, that I\'d never be able to stand another\r\nwinter in England. He said I must go to Egypt."\r\n\r\n"Egypt," she repeated. "Is that very far from here?"\r\n\r\n"What matter how far it is! If I can\'t live in England I must go where I\r\ncan live."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be cross, dear. I know it\'s your health that makes you that\r\nirritable, but it\'s hard to bear at times."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t care to go to Egypt with me."\r\n\r\n"How can you think that, Bill? Have I ever refused you anything?"\r\n\r\n"Quite right, old girl, I\'m sorry. I know you\'d do anything for me. I\'ve\r\nalways said so, haven\'t I? It\'s this cough that makes me sharp tempered\r\nand fretful. I shall be different when I get to Egypt."\r\n\r\n"When do we start?"\r\n\r\n"If we get away by the end of October it will be all right. It will cost a\r\nlot of money; the journey is expensive, and we shall have to stop there\r\nsix months. I couldn\'t think of coming home before the end of April."\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer. They walked some yards in silence. Then he said--\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been very unlucky lately; there isn\'t much over a hundred pounds in\r\nthe bank."\r\n\r\n"How much shall we want?"\r\n\r\n"Three or four hundred pounds at least. We won\'t take the boy with us, we\r\ncouldn\'t afford that; but I should like to pay a couple of quarters in\r\nadvance."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t be much."\r\n\r\n"Not if I have any luck. The luck must turn, and I have some splendid\r\ninformation about the Great Ebor and the Yorkshire Stakes. Stack knows of\r\na horse or two that\'s being kept for Sandown. Unfortunately there is not\r\nmuch doing in August. I must try to make up the money: it\'s a matter of\r\nlife and death."\r\n\r\nIt was for his very life that her husband was now gambling on the\r\nrace-course, and a sensation of very great wickedness came up in her mind,\r\nbut she stifled it instantly. William had noticed the look of fear that\r\nappeared in her eyes, and he said--\r\n\r\n"It\'s my last chance. I can\'t get the money any other way; and I don\'t\r\nwant to die yet awhile. I haven\'t been as good to you as I\'d like, and I\r\nwant to do something for the boy, you know."\r\n\r\nHe had been told not to remain out after sundown, but he was resolved to\r\nleave no stone unturned in his search for information, and often he\r\nreturned home as late as nine and ten o\'clock at night coughing--Esther\r\ncould hear him all up the street. He came in ready to drop with fatigue,\r\nhis pockets filled with sporting papers, and these he studied, spreading\r\nthem on the table under the lamp, while Esther sat striving to do some\r\nneedlework. It often dropped out of her hands, and her eyes filled with\r\ntears. But she took care that he should not see these tears; she did not\r\nwish to distress him unnecessarily. Poor chap! he had enough to put up\r\nwith as it was. Sometimes he read out the horses\' names and asked her\r\nwhich she thought would win, which seemed to her a likely name. But she\r\nbegged of him not to ask her; they had many quarrels on this subject, but\r\nin the end he understood that it was not fair to ask her. Sometimes Stack\r\nand Journeyman came in, and they argued about weights and distances, until\r\nmidnight; old John came to see them, and every day he had heard some new\r\ntip. It often rose to Esther\'s lips to tell William to back his fancy and\r\nhave done with it; she could see that these discussions only fatigued him,\r\nthat he was no nearer to the truth now than he was a fortnight ago.\r\nMeanwhile the horse he had thought of backing had gone up in the betting.\r\nBut he said that he must be very careful. They had only a hundred pounds\r\nleft; he must be careful not to risk this money foolishly--it was his very\r\nlife-blood. If he were to lose all this money, he wouldn\'t only sign his\r\nown death warrant, but also hers. He might linger on a long while--there\r\nwas no knowing, but he would never be able to do any work, that was\r\ncertain (unless he went out to Egypt); the doctor had said so, and then it\r\nwould be she who would have to support him. And if God were merciful\r\nenough to take him off at once he would leave her in a worse plight than\r\nhe had found her in, and the boy growing up! Oh, it was terrible! He\r\nburied his face in his hands, and seemed quite overcome. Then the cough\r\nwould take him, and for a few minutes he could only think of himself.\r\nEsther gave him a little milk to drink, and he said--\r\n\r\n"There\'s a hundred pounds left, Esther. It isn\'t much, but it\'s something.\r\nI don\'t believe that there\'s much use in my going to Egypt. I shall never\r\nget well. It is better that I should pitch myself into the river. That\r\nwould be the least selfish way out of it."\r\n\r\n"William, I will not have you talk in that way," Esther said, laying down\r\nher work and going over to him. "If you was to do such a thing I should\r\nnever forgive you. I could never think the same of you."\r\n\r\n"All right, old girl, don\'t be frightened. I\'ve been thinking too much\r\nabout them horses, and am a bit depressed. I daresay it will come out all\r\nright. I think that Mahomet is sure to win the Great Ebor, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there\'s no better judge than yourself. They all say if he\r\ndon\'t fall lame that he\'s bound to win."\r\n\r\n"Then Mahomet shall carry my money. I\'ll back him to-morrow."\r\n\r\nNow that he had made up his mind what horse to back his spirits revived.\r\nHe was able to dismiss the subject from his mind, and they talked of other\r\nthings, of their son, and they laid projects for his welfare. But on the\r\nday of the race, from early morning, William could barely contain himself.\r\nUsually he took his winnings and losings very quietly. When he had been\r\nespecially unlucky he swore a bit, but Esther had never seen any great\r\nexcitement before a race was run. The issues of this race were\r\nextraordinary, and it was heart-breaking to see him suffer; he could not\r\nremain still a moment. A prey to all the terrors of hope, exhausted with\r\nanticipation, he rested himself against the sideboard and wiped drops of\r\nsweat from his forehead. A broiling sunlight infested their window-panes,\r\nthe room grew oven-like, and he was obliged at last to go into the back\r\nparlour and lie down. He lay there in his shirt sleeves quite exhausted,\r\nhardly able to breathe; the arm once so strong and healthy was shrunken to\r\na little nothing. He seemed quite bloodless, and looking at him Esther\r\ncould hardly hope that any climate would restore him to health. He just\r\nasked her what the time was, and said, "The race is being run now." A few\r\nminutes after he said, "I think Mahomet has won. I fancied I saw him get\r\nfirst past the post." He spoke as if he were sure, and said nothing about\r\nthe evening paper. If he were disappointed, Esther felt that it would kill\r\nhim, and she knelt down by the bedside and prayed that God would allow the\r\nhorse to win. It meant her husband\'s life, that was all she knew. Oh, that\r\nthe horse might win! Presently he said, "There\'s no use praying, I feel\r\nsure it is all right. Go into the next room, stand on the balcony so that\r\nyou may see the boy coming along."\r\n\r\nA pale yellow sky rose behind the brick neighbourhood, and with agonised\r\nsoul the woman viewed its plausive serenity. There seemed to be hope in\r\nits quietness. At that moment the cry came up, "Win-ner, Win-ner." It came\r\nfrom the north, from the east, and now from the west. Three boys were\r\nshouting forth the news simultaneously. Ah, if it should prove bad news!\r\nBut somehow she too felt that the news was good. She ran to meet the boy.\r\nShe had a half-penny ready in her hand; he fumbled, striving to detach a\r\nsingle paper from the quire under his arm. Seeing her impatience, he said,\r\n"Mahomet\'s won." Then the pavement seemed to slide beneath her feet, and\r\nthe setting sun she could hardly see, so full was her heart, so burdened\r\nwith the happiness that she was bringing to the poor sick fellow who lay\r\nin his shirt sleeves on the bed in the back room. "It\'s all right," she\r\nsaid. "I thought so too; it seemed like it." His face flushed, life seemed\r\nto come back. He sat up and took the paper from her. "There," he said,\r\n"I\'ve got my place-money, too. I hope Stack and Journeyman come in\r\ntonight. I\'d like to have a chat about this. Come, give me a kiss, dear.\r\nI\'m not going to die, after all. It isn\'t a pleasant thing to think that\r\nyou must die, that there\'s no hope for you, that you must go under\r\nground."\r\n\r\nThe next thing to do was to pick the winner of the Yorkshire Handicap. In\r\nthis he was not successful, but he backed several winners at Sandown Park,\r\nand at the close of the week had made nearly enough to take him to Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe Doncaster week, however, proved disastrous. He lost most of his\r\nwinnings, and had to look forward to retrieving his fortunes at Newmarket.\r\n"The worst of it is, if I don\'t make up the money by October, it will be\r\nno use. They say the November fogs will polish me off."\r\n\r\nBetween Doncaster and Newmarket he lost a bet, and this bet carried him\r\nback into despondency. He felt it was no use struggling against fate.\r\nBetter remain in London and be taken away at the end of November or\r\nDecember; he couldn\'t last much longer than that. This would allow him to\r\nleave Esther at least fifty pounds to go on with. The boy would soon be\r\nable to earn money. It would be better so. No use wasting all this money\r\nfor the sake of his health, which wasn\'t worth two-pence-three-farthings.\r\nIt was like throwing sovereigns after farthings. He didn\'t want to do any\r\nbetting; he was as hollow as a shell inside, he could feel it. Egypt could\r\ndo nothing for him, and as he had to go, better sooner than later. Esther\r\nargued with him. What should she have to live for if he was taken from\r\nher. The doctors had said that Egypt might set him right. She didn\'t know\r\nmuch about such things, but she had always heard that it was extraordinary\r\nhow people got cured out there.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," he said. "I\'ve heard that people who couldn\'t live a week\r\nin England, who haven\'t the length of your finger of lung left, can go on\r\nall right out there. I might get something to do out there, and the boy\r\nmight come out after us."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way I like to hear you talk. Who knows, at Newmarket we might\r\nhave luck! Just one big bet, a winner at fifty to one, that\'s all we\r\nwant."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what has been passing in my mind. I\'ve got particular\r\ninformation about the Cesarewitch and Cambridgeshire. I could get the\r\nprice you speak of--fifty to one against the two, Matchbox and\r\nChasuble--the double event, you know. I\'m inclined to go it. It\'s my last\r\nchance."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Matchbox galloped home the winner of the Cesarewitch by five lengths,\r\nWilliam was lying in his bed, seemingly at death\'s door. He had remained\r\nout late one evening, had caught cold, and his mouth was constantly filled\r\nwith blood. He was much worse, and could hardly take notice of the good\r\nnews. When he revived a little he said, "It has come too late." But when\r\nChasuble was backed to win thousands at ten to one, and Journeyman and\r\nStack assured him that the stable was quite confident of being able to\r\npull it off, his spirits revived. He spoke of hedging. "If," he said to\r\nEsther, "I was to get out at eight or nine to one I should be able to\r\nleave you something, you know, in case of accidents." But he would not\r\nentrust laying off his bet to either Stack of Journeyman; he spoke of a\r\ncab and seeing to it himself. If he did this the doctor assured him that\r\nit would not much matter whether Chasuble won or lost. "The best thing he\r\ncould do," the doctor said, "would be to become an in-door patient at\r\nonce. In the hospital he would be in an equable temperature, and he would\r\nreceive an attention which he could not get at home."\r\n\r\nWilliam did not like going into the hospital; it would be a bad omen. If\r\nhe did, he felt sure that Chasuble would not win.\r\n\r\n"What has going or not going to the hospital to do with Chasuble\'s chance\r\nof winning the Cambridgeshire?" said the doctor. "This window is loose in\r\nits sash, a draught comes under the door, and if you close out the\r\ndraughts the atmosphere of the room becomes stuffy. You\'re thinking of\r\ngoing abroad; a fortnight\'s nice rest is just what you want to set you up\r\nfor your journey."\r\n\r\nSo he allowed himself to be persuaded; he was taken to the hospital, and\r\nEsther remained at home waiting for the fateful afternoon. Now that the\r\ndying man was taken from her she had no work to distract her thought. The\r\nunanswerable question--would Chasuble win?--was always before her. She saw\r\nthe slender greyhound creatures as she had seen them at Epsom, through a\r\nsea of heads and hats, and she asked herself if Chasuble was the brown\r\nhorse that had galloped in first, or the chestnut that had trotted in\r\nlast. She often thought she was going mad--her head seemed like it--a\r\nsensation of splitting like a piece of calico.... She went to see her boy.\r\nJack was a great tall fellow of fifteen, and had happily lost none of his\r\naffection for his mother, and great sweetness rose up within her. She\r\nlooked at his long, straight, yellow-stockinged legs; she settled the\r\ncollar of his cloak, and slipped her fingers into his leathern belt as\r\nthey walked side by side. He was bare-headed, according to the fashion of\r\nhis school, and she kissed the wild, dark curls with which his head was\r\nrun over; they were much brighter in colour when he was a little\r\nboy--those days when she slaved seventeen hours a day for his dear life!\r\nBut he paid her back tenfold for the hardship she had undergone.\r\n\r\nShe listened to the excellent report his masters gave of his progress, and\r\nwalked through the quadrangles and the corridors with him, thinking of the\r\nsound of his voice as he told her the story of his classes and his\r\nstudies. She must live for him; though for herself she had had enough of\r\nlife. But, thank God, she had her darling boy, and whatever unhappiness\r\nthere might be in store for her she would bear it for his sake. He knew\r\nthat his father was ill, but she refrained and told him no word of the\r\ntragedy that was hanging over them. The noble instincts which were so\r\nintrinsically Esther Waters\' told her that it were a pity to soil at the\r\noutset a young life with a sordid story, and though it would have been an\r\ninexpressible relief to her to have shared her trouble with her boy, she\r\nforced back her tears and courageously bore her cross alone, without once\r\nallowing its edge to touch him.\r\n\r\nAnd every day that visitors were allowed she went to the hospital with the\r\nnewspaper containing the last betting. "Chasuble, ten to one taken,"\r\nWilliam read out. The mare had advanced three points, and William looked\r\nat Esther inquiringly, and with hope in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I think she\'ll win," he said, raising himself in his cane chair.\r\n\r\n"I hope so, dear," she murmured, and she settled his cushions.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the mare was back again at thirteen to one taken and\r\noffered; she went back even as far as eighteen to one, and then returned\r\nfor a while to twelve to one. This fluctuation meant that something was\r\nwrong, and William began to lose hope. But on the following day the mare\r\nwas backed to win a good deal of money at Tattersall\'s, and once more she\r\nstood at ten to one. Seeing her back at the old price made William look so\r\nhopeful that a patient stopped as he passed down the corridor, and\r\ncatching sight of the _Sportsman_ on William\'s lap, he asked him if he was\r\ninterested in racing. William told him that he was, and that if Chasuble\r\nwon he would be able to go to Egypt.\r\n\r\n"Them that has money can buy health as well as everything else. We\'d all\r\nget well if we could get out there."\r\n\r\nWilliam told him how much he stood to win.\r\n\r\n"That\'ll keep you going long enough to set you straight. You say the\r\nmare\'s backed at ten to one--two hundred to twenty. I wonder if I could\r\nget the money. I might sell up the \'ouse."\r\n\r\nBut before he had time to realise the necessary money the mare was driven\r\nback to eighteen to one, and he said--\r\n\r\n"She won\'t win. I might as well leave the wife in the \'ouse. There\'s no\r\nluck for them that comes \'ere."\r\n\r\nOn the day of the race Esther walked through the streets like one daft,\r\nstupidly interested in the passers-by and the disputes that arose between\r\nthe drivers of cabs and omnibuses. Now and then her thoughts collected,\r\nand it seemed to her impossible that the mare should win. If she did they\r\nwould have L2,500, and would go to Egypt. But she could not imagine such a\r\nthing; it seemed so much more natural that the horse should lose, and that\r\nher husband should die, and that she should have to face the world once\r\nmore. She offered up prayers that Chasuble might win, although it did not\r\nseem right to address God on the subject, but her heart often felt like\r\nbreaking, and she had to do something. And she had no doubt that God would\r\nforgive her. But now that the day had come she did not feel as if he had\r\ngranted her request. At the same time it did not seem possible that her\r\nhusband was going to die. It was all so hard to understand.\r\n\r\nShe stopped at the "Bell and Horns" to see what the time was, and was\r\nsurprised to find it was half-an-hour later than she had expected. The\r\nrace was being run, Chasuble\'s hoofs were deciding whether her husband was\r\nto live or die. It was on the wire by this time. The wires were distinct\r\nupon a blue and dove-coloured sky. Did that one go to Newmarket, or the\r\nother? Which?\r\n\r\nThe red building came in sight, and a patient walked slowly up the walk,\r\nhis back turned to her; another had sat down to rest. Sixteen years ago\r\npatients were walking there then, and the leaves were scattering then just\r\nas now.... Without transition of thought she wondered when the first boy\r\nwould appear with the news. William was not in the grounds; he was\r\nupstairs behind those windows. Poor fellow, she could fancy him sitting\r\nthere. Perhaps he was watching for her out of one of those windows. But\r\nthere was no use her going up until she had the news; she must wait for\r\nthe paper. She walked up and down listening for the cry. Every now and\r\nthen expectation led her to mistake some ordinary cry for the terrible\r\n"Win-ner, all the win-ner," with which the whole town would echo in a few\r\nminutes. She hastened forward. No, it was not it. At last she heard the\r\nword shrieked behind her. She hastened after the boy, but failed to\r\novertake him. Returning, she met another, gave him a half-penny and took a\r\npaper. Then she remembered she must ask the boy to tell her who won. But\r\nheedless of her question he had run across the road to sell papers to some\r\nmen who had come out of a public-house. She must not give William the\r\npaper and wait for him to read the news to her. If the news were bad the\r\nshock might kill him. She must learn first what the news was, so that her\r\nface and manner might prepare him for the worst if need be. So she offered\r\nthe paper to the porter and asked him to tell her. "Bramble, King of\r\nTrumps, Young Hopeful," he read out.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure that Chasuble hasn\'t won?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m sure, there it is."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t read," she said as she turned away.\r\n\r\nThe news had stunned her; the world seemed to lose reality; she was\r\nuncertain what to do, and several times repeated to herself, "There\'s\r\nnothing for it but to go up and tell him. I don\'t see what else I can do."\r\nThe staircase was very steep; she climbed it slowly, and stopped at the\r\nfirst landing and looked out of the window. A poor hollow-chested\r\ncreature, the wreck of a human being, struggled up behind her. He had to\r\nrest several times, and in the hollow building his cough sounded loud and\r\nhollow. "It isn\'t generally so loud as that," she thought, and wondered\r\nhow she could tell William the news. "He wanted to see Jack grow up to be\r\na man. He thought that we might all go to Egypt, and that he\'d get quite\r\nwell there, for there\'s plenty of sunshine there, but now he\'ll have to\r\nmake up his mind to die in the November fogs." Her thoughts came strangely\r\nclear, and she was astonished at her indifference, until a sudden\r\nrevulsion of feeling took her as she was going up the last flight. She\r\ncouldn\'t tell him the news; it was too cruel. She let the patient pass\r\nher, and when alone on the landing she looked down into the depth. She\r\nthought she\'d like to fall over; anything rather than to do what she knew\r\nshe must do. But her cowardice only endured for a moment, and with a firm\r\nstep she walked into the corridor. It seemed to cross the entire building,\r\nand was floored and wainscotted with the same brown varnished wood as the\r\nstaircase. There were benches along the walls; and emaciated and worn-out\r\nmen lay on the long cane chairs in the windowed recesses by which the\r\npassage was lighted. The wards, containing sometimes three, sometimes six\r\nor seven beds, opened on to this passage. The doors of the wards were all\r\nopen, and as she passed along she started at the sight of a boy sitting up\r\nin bed. His head had been shaved and only a slight bristle covered the\r\ncrown. The head and face were a large white mass with two eyes. At the end\r\nof the passage there was a window; and William sat there reading a book.\r\nHe saw her before she saw him, and when she caught sight of him she\r\nstopped, holding the paper loose before her between finger and thumb, and\r\nas she approached she saw that her manner had already broken the news to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I see that she didn\'t win," he said.\r\n\r\n"No, dear, she didn\'t win. We wasn\'t lucky this time: next time--"\r\n\r\n"There is no next time, at least for me. I shall be far away from here\r\nwhen flat racing begins again. The November fogs will do for me, I feel\r\nthat they will. I hope there\'ll be no lingering, that\'s all. Better to\r\nknow the worst and make up your mind. So I have to go, have I? So there\'s\r\nno hope, and I shall be under ground before the next meeting. I shall\r\nnever lay or take the odds again. It do seem strange. If only that mare\r\nhad won. I knew damned well she wouldn\'t if I came here."\r\n\r\nThen, catching sight of the pained look on his wife\'s face, he said, "I\r\ndon\'t suppose it made no difference; it was to be, and what has to be has\r\nto be. I\'ve got to go under ground. I felt it was to be all along. Egypt\r\nwould have done me no good; I never believed in it--only a lot of false\r\nhope. You don\'t think what I say is true. Look \'ere, do you know what book\r\nthis is? This is the Bible; that\'ll prove to you that I knew the game was\r\nup. I knew, I can\'t tell you how, but I knew the mare wouldn\'t win. One\r\nalways seems to know. Even when I backed her I didn\'t feel about her like\r\nI did about the other one, and ever since I\'ve been feeling more and more\r\nsure that it wasn\'t to be. Somehow it didn\'t seem likely, and to-day\r\nsomething told me that the game was up, so I asked for this book....\r\nThere\'s wonderful beautiful things in it."\r\n\r\n"There is, indeed, Bill; and I hope you won\'t get tired of it, but will go\r\non reading it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s extraordinary how consoling it is. Listen to this. Isn\'t it\r\nbeautiful; ain\'t them words heavenly?"\r\n\r\n"They is, indeed. I knew you\'d come to God at last."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'ve not led a good life. I wouldn\'t listen to you when you\r\nused to tell me of the lot of harm the betting used to bring on the poor\r\npeople what used to come to our place. There\'s Sarah, I suppose she\'s out\r\nof prison by this. You\'ve seen nothing of her, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"No, nothing."\r\n\r\n"There was Ketley."\r\n\r\n"No, Bill, don\'t let\'s think about it. If you\'re truly sorry, God will\r\nforgive."\r\n\r\n"Do you think He will--and the others that we know nothing about? I\r\nwouldn\'t listen to you; I was headstrong, but I understand it all now. My\r\neyes \'ave been opened. Them pious folk that got up the prosecution knew\r\nwhat they was about. I forgive them one and all."\r\n\r\nWilliam coughed a little. The conversation paused, and the cough was\r\nrepeated down the corridor. Now it came from the men lying on the long\r\ncane chairs; now from the poor emaciated creature, hollow cheeks, brown\r\neyes and beard, who had just come out of his ward and had sat down on a\r\nbench by the wall. Now it came from an old man six feet high, with\r\nsnow-white hair. He sat near them, and worked assiduously at a piece of\r\ntapestry. "It\'ll be better when it\'s cut," he said to one of the nurses,\r\nwho had stopped to compliment him on his work; "it\'ll be better when it\'s\r\ncut." Then the cough came from one of the wards, and Esther thought of the\r\nfearsome boy sitting bolt up, his huge tallow-like face staring through\r\nthe silence of the room. A moment after the cough came from her husband\'s\r\nlips, and they looked at each other. Both wanted to speak, and neither\r\nknew what to say. At last William spoke.\r\n\r\n"I was saying that I never had that feeling about Chasuble as one \'as\r\nabout a winner. Did she run second? Just like my luck if she did. Let me\r\nsee the paper."\r\n\r\nEsther handed it to him.\r\n\r\n"Bramble, a fifty to one chance, not a man in a hundred backed her; King\r\nof Trumps, there was some place money lost on him; Young Hopeful, a rank\r\noutsider. What a day for the bookies!"\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t think of them things no more," said Esther. "You\'ve got the\r\nBook; it\'ll do you more good."\r\n\r\n"If I\'d only have thought of Bramble... I could have had a hundred to one\r\nagainst Matchbox and Bramble coupled."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of thinking of things that\'s over? We should think of the\r\nfuture."\r\n\r\n"If I\'d only been able to hedge that bet I should have been able to leave\r\nyou something to go on with, but now, when everything is paid for, you\'ll\r\nhave hardly a five-pound note. You\'ve been a good wife to me, and I\'ve\r\nbeen a bad husband to you."\r\n\r\n"Bill, you mustn\'t speak like that. You must try to make your peace with\r\nGod. Think of Him. He\'ll think of us that you leave behind. I\'ve always\r\nhad faith in Him. He\'ll not desert me."\r\n\r\nHer eyes were quite dry; the instinct of life seemed to have left her.\r\nThey spoke some little while longer, until it was time for visitors to\r\nleave the hospital. It was not until she got into the Fulham Road that\r\ntears began to run down her cheeks; they poured faster and faster, like\r\nrain after long dry weather. The whole world disappeared in a mist of\r\ntears. And so overcome was she by her grief that she had to lean against\r\nthe railings, and then the passers-by turned and looked at her curiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWith fair weather he might hold on till Christmas, but if much fog was\r\nabout he would go off with the last leaves. One day Esther received a\r\nletter asking her to defer her visit from Friday to Sunday. He hoped to be\r\nbetter on Sunday, and then they would arrange when she should come to take\r\nhim away. He begged of her to have Jack home to meet him. He wanted to see\r\nhis boy before he died.\r\n\r\nMrs. Collins, a woman who lived in the next room, read the letter to\r\nEsther.\r\n\r\n"If you can, do as he wishes. Once they gets them fancies into their heads\r\nthere\'s no getting them out."\r\n\r\n"If he leaves the hospital on a day like this it\'ll be the death of him."\r\n\r\nBoth women went to the window. The fog was so thick that only an outline\r\nhere and there was visible of the houses opposite. The lamps burnt low,\r\nmournful, as in a city of the dead, and the sounds that rose out of the\r\nstreet added to the terror of the strange darkness.\r\n\r\n"What do he say about Jack? That I\'m to send for him. It\'s natural he\r\nshould like to see the boy before he goes, but it would be cheerfuller to\r\ntake him to the hospital."\r\n\r\n"You see, he wants to die at home; he wants you to be with him at the\r\nlast."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I want to see the last of him. But the boy, where\'s he to sleep?"\r\n\r\n"We can lay a mattress down in my room--an old woman like me, it don\'t\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\nSunday morning was harsh and cold, and when she came out of South\r\nKensington Station a fog was rising in the squares, and a great whiff of\r\nyellow cloud drifted down upon the house-tops. In the Fulham road the tops\r\nof the houses disappeared, and the light of the third gas-lamp was not\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\n"This is the sort of weather that takes them off. I can hardly breathe it\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nEverything was shadow-like; those walking in front of her passed out of\r\nsight like shades, and once she thought she must have missed her way,\r\nthough that was impossible, for her way was quite straight.... Suddenly\r\nthe silhouette of the winged building rose up enormous on the sulphur sky.\r\nThe low-lying gardens were full of poisonous vapour, and the thin trees\r\nseemed like the ghosts of consumptive men. The porter coughed like a dead\r\nman as she passed, and he said, "Bad weather for the poor sick ones\r\nupstairs."\r\n\r\nShe was prepared for a change for the worse, but she did not expect to see\r\na living man looking so like a dead one.\r\n\r\nHe could no longer lie back in bed and breathe, so he was propped up with\r\npillows, and he looked even as shadow-like as those she had half seen in\r\nthe fog-cloud. There was fog even in the ward, and the lights burned red\r\nin the silence. There were five beds--low iron bedsteads--and each was\r\ncovered with a dark red rug. In the furthest corner lay the wreck of a\r\ngreat working man. He wore his hob-nails and his corduroys, and his once\r\nbrawny arm lay along his thigh, shrivelled and powerless as a child\'s. In\r\nthe middle of the room a little clerk, wasted and weary, without any\r\nstrength at all, lay striving for breath. The navvy was alone; the little\r\nclerk had his family round him, his wife and his two children, a baby in\r\narms and a little boy three years old. The doctor had just come in, and\r\nthe woman was prattling gaily about her confinement. She said--\r\n\r\n"I was up the following week. Wonderful what we women can go through. No\r\none would think it.... brought the childer to see their father; they is a\r\nlittle idol to him, poor fellow."\r\n\r\n"How are you to-day, dearie?" Esther said, as she took a seat by her\r\nhusband\'s bed.\r\n\r\n"Better than I was on Friday, but this weather\'ll do for me if it\r\ncontinues much longer.... You see them two beds? They died yesterday, and\r\nI\'ve \'eard that three or four that left the hospital are gone, too."\r\n\r\nThe doctor came to William\'s bed. "Well, are you still determined to go\r\nhome?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'d like to die at home. You can\'t do nothing for me.... I\'d like to\r\ndie at home; I want to see my boy."\r\n\r\n"You can see Jack here," said Esther.\r\n\r\n"I\'d sooner see him at \'ome.... I suppose you don\'t want the trouble of a\r\ndeath in the \'ouse."\r\n\r\n"Oh, William, how can you speak so!" The patient coughed painfully, and\r\nleaned against the pillows, unable to speak.\r\n\r\nEsther remained with William till the time permitted to visitors had\r\nexpired. He could not speak to her but she knew he liked her to be with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen she came on Thursday to take him away, he was a little better. The\r\nclerk\'s wife was chattering; the great navvy lay in the corner, still as a\r\nblock of stone. Esther often looked at him and wondered if he had no\r\nfriend who could spare an hour to come and see him.\r\n\r\n"I was beginning to think that you wasn\'t coming," said William.\r\n\r\n"He\'s that restless," said the clerk\'s wife; "asking the time every three\r\nor four minutes."\r\n\r\n"How could you think that?" said Esther.\r\n\r\n"I dun know... you\'re a bit late, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"It often do make them that restless," said the clerk\'s wife. "But my poor\r\nold man is quiet enough--aren\'t you, dear?" The dying clerk could not\r\nanswer, and the woman turned again to Esther.\r\n\r\n"And how do you find him to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Much the same.... I think he\'s a bit better; stronger, don\'t yer know.\r\nBut this weather is that trying. I don\'t know how it was up your way, but\r\ndown my way I never seed such a fog. I thought I\'d have to turn back." At\r\nthat moment the baby began to cry, and the woman walked up and down the\r\nward, rocking it violently, talking loud, and making a great deal of\r\nnoise. But she could not quiet him.... "Hungry again," she said. "I never\r\nseed such a child for the breast," and she sat down and unbuttoned her\r\ndress. When the young doctor entered she hurriedly covered herself; he\r\nbegged her to continue, and spoke about her little boy. She showed him a\r\nscar on his throat. He had been suffering, but it was all right now. The\r\ndoctor glanced at the breathless father.\r\n\r\n"A little better to-day, thank you, doctor."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right;" and the doctor went over to William.\r\n\r\n"Are you still determined to leave the hospital?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I want to go home. I want to--"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find this weather very trying; you\'d better--"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, sir. I should like to go home. You\'ve been very kind;\r\nyou\'ve done everything that could be done for me. But it\'s God\'s will....\r\nMy wife is very grateful to you, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, I am, sir. However am I to thank you for your kindness to my\r\nhusband?\'\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I couldn\'t do more. But you\'ll want the sister to help you to\r\ndress him. I\'ll send her to you."\r\n\r\nWhen they got him out of bed, Esther was shocked at the spectacle of his\r\npoor body. There was nothing left of him. His poor chest, his wasted ribs,\r\nhis legs gone to nothing, and the strange weakness, worst of all, which\r\nmade it so hard for them to dress him. At last it was nearly done: Esther\r\nlaced one boot, the nurse the other, and, leaning on Esther\'s arm, he\r\nlooked round the room for the last time. The navvy turned round on his bed\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, mate."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye.... Good-bye, all."\r\n\r\nThe clerk\'s little son clung to his mother\'s skirt, frightened at the\r\nweakness of so big a man.\r\n\r\n"Go and say good-bye to the gentleman."\r\n\r\nThe little boy came forward timidly, offering his hand. William looked at\r\nthe poor little white face; he nodded to the father and went out.\r\n\r\nAs he went downstairs he said he would like to go home in a hansom. The\r\ndoctor and nurse expostulated, but he persisted until Esther begged of him\r\nto forego the wish for her sake.\r\n\r\n"They do rattle so, these four-wheelers, especially when the windows are\r\nup. One can\'t speak."\r\n\r\nThe cab jogged up Piccadilly, and as it climbed out of the hollow the\r\ndying man\'s eyes were fixed on the circle of lights that shone across the\r\nGreen Park. They looked like a distant village, and Esther wondered if\r\nWilliam was thinking of Shoreham--she had seen Shoreham look like that\r\nsometimes--or if he was thinking that he was looking on London for the\r\nlast time. Was he saying to himself, "I shall never, never see Piccadilly\r\nagain"? They passed St. James\'s Street. The Circus, with its mob of\r\nprostitutes, came into view; the "Criterion" bar, with its loafers\r\nstanding outside. William leaned a little forward, and Esther was sure he\r\nwas thinking that he would never go into that bar again. The cab turned to\r\nthe left, and Esther said that it would cross Soho, perhaps pass down Old\r\nCompton Street, opposite their old house. It happened that it did, and\r\nEsther and William wondered who were the new people who were selling beer\r\nand whisky in the bar? All the while boys were crying, "Win-ner, all the\r\nwin-ner!"\r\n\r\n"The ---- was run to-day. Flat racing all over, all over for this year."\r\n\r\nEsther did not answer. The cab passed over a piece of asphalte, and he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Is Jack waiting for us?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he came home yesterday."\r\n\r\nThe fog was thick in Bloomsbury, and when he got out of the cab he was\r\ntaken with a fit of coughing, and had to cling to the railings. She had to\r\npay the cab, and it took some time to find the money. Would no one open\r\nthe door? She was surprised to see him make his way up the steps to the\r\nbell, and having got her change, she followed him into the house.\r\n\r\n"I can manage. Go on first; I\'ll follow."\r\n\r\nAnd stopping every three or four steps for rest, he slowly dragged himself\r\nup to the first landing. A door opened and Jack stood on the threshold of\r\nthe lighted room.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear; your father is coming up."\r\n\r\nThe boy came forward to help, but his mother whispered, "He\'d rather come\r\nup by himself."\r\n\r\nWilliam had just strength to walk into the room; they gave him a chair,\r\nand he fell back exhausted. He looked around, and seemed pleased to see\r\nhis home again. Esther gave him some milk, into which she had put a little\r\nbrandy, and he gradually revived.\r\n\r\n"Come this way, Jack; I want to look at you; come into the light where I\r\ncan see you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, father."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t long to see you, Jack. I wanted to be with you and your mother\r\nin our own home. I can talk a little now: I may not be able to to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Yes, father."\r\n\r\n"I want you to promise me, Jack, that you\'ll never have nothing to do with\r\nracing and betting. It hasn\'t brought me or your mother any luck."\r\n\r\n"Very well, father."\r\n\r\n"You promise me, Jack. Give me your hand. You promise me that, Jack."\r\n\r\n"Yes, father, I promise."\r\n\r\n"I see it all clearly enough now. Your mother, Jack, is the best woman in\r\nthe world. She loved you better than I did. She worked for you--that is a\r\nsad story. I hope you\'ll never hear it."\r\n\r\nHusband and wife looked at each other, and in that look the wife promised\r\nthe husband that the son should never know the story of her desertion.\r\n\r\n"She was always against the betting, Jack; she always knew it would bring\r\nus ill-luck. I was once well off, but I lost everything. No good comes of\r\nmoney that one doesn\'t work for."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you worked enough for what you won," said Esther; "travelling\r\nday and night from race-course to race-course. Standing on them\r\nrace-courses in all weathers; it was the colds you caught standing on them\r\nrace-courses that began the mischief."\r\n\r\n"I worked hard enough, that\'s true; but it was not the right kind of\r\nwork.... I can\'t argue, Esther.... But I know the truth now, what you\r\nalways said was the truth. No good comes of money that hasn\'t been\r\nproperly earned."\r\n\r\nHe sipped the brandy-and-milk and looked at Jack, who was crying bitterly.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t cry like that, Jack; I want you to listen to me. I\'ve still\r\nsomething on my mind. Your mother, Jack, is the best woman that ever\r\nlived. You\'re too young to understand how good. I didn\'t know how good for\r\na long time, but I found it all out in time, as you will later, Jack, when\r\nyou are a man. I\'d hoped to see you grow up to be a man, Jack, and your\r\nmother and I thought that you\'d have a nice bit of money. But the money I\r\nhoped to leave you is all gone. What I feel most is that I\'m leaving you\r\nand your mother as badly off as she was when I married her." He heaved a\r\ndeep sigh, and Esther said--\r\n\r\n"What is the good of talking of these things, weakening yourself for\r\nnothing?"\r\n\r\n"I must speak, Esther. I should die happy if I knew how you and the boy\r\nwas going to live. You\'ll have to go out and work for him as you did\r\nbefore. It will be like beginning it all again."\r\n\r\nThe tears rolled down his cheeks; he buried his face in his hands and\r\nsobbed, until the sobbing brought on a fit of coughing. Suddenly his mouth\r\nfilled with blood. Jack went for the doctor, and all remedies were tried\r\nwithout avail. "There is one more remedy," the doctor said, "and if that\r\nfails you must prepare for the worst." But this last remedy proved\r\nsuccessful, and the haemorrhage was stopped, and William was undressed and\r\nput to bed. The doctor said, "He mustn\'t get up to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"You lie in bed to-morrow, and try to get up your strength. You\'ve\r\noverdone yourself to-day."\r\n\r\nShe had drawn his bed into the warmest corner, close by the fire, and had\r\nmade up for herself a sort of bed by the window, where she might doze a\r\nbit, for she did not expect to get much sleep. She would have to be up and\r\ndown many times to settle his pillows and give him milk or a little weak\r\nbrandy-and-water.\r\n\r\nNight wore away, the morning grew into day, and about twelve o\'clock he\r\ninsisted on getting up. She tried to persuade him, but he said he could\r\nnot stop in bed; and there was nothing for it but to ask Mrs. Collins to\r\nhelp her dress him. They placed him comfortably in a chair. The cough had\r\nentirely ceased and he seemed better. And on Saturday night he slept\r\nbetter than he had done for a long while and woke up on Sunday morning\r\nrefreshed and apparently much stronger. He had a nice bit of boiled rabbit\r\nfor his dinner. He didn\'t speak much; Esther fancied that he was still\r\nthinking of them. When the afternoon waned, about four o\'clock, he called\r\nJack; he told him to sit in the light where he could see him, and he\r\nlooked at his son with such wistful eyes. These farewells were very sad,\r\nand Esther had to turn aside to hide her tears.\r\n\r\n"I should have liked to have seen you a man, Jack."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak like that--I can\'t bear it," said the poor boy, bursting into\r\ntears. "Perhaps you won\'t die yet."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Jack; I\'m wore out. I can feel," he said, pointing to his chest,\r\n"that there is nothing here to live upon.... It is the punishment come\r\nupon me."\r\n\r\n"Punishment for what, father?"\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t always good to your mother, Jack."\r\n\r\n"If to please me, William, you\'ll say no more."\r\n\r\n"The boy ought to know; it will be a lesson for him, and it weighs upon my\r\nheart."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want my boy to hear anything bad about his father, and I forbid\r\nhim to listen."\r\n\r\nThe conversation paused, and soon after William said that his strength was\r\ngoing from him, and that he would like to go back to bed. Esther helped\r\nhim off with his clothes, and together she and Jack lifted him into bed.\r\nHe sat up looking at them with wistful, dying eyes.\r\n\r\n"It is hard to part from you," he said. "If Chasuble had won we would have\r\nall gone to Egypt. I could have lived out there."\r\n\r\n"You must speak of them things no more. We all must obey God\'s will."\r\nEsther dropped on her knees; she drew Jack down beside her, and William\r\nasked Jack to read something from the Bible. Jack read where he first\r\nopened the book, and when he had finished William said that he liked to\r\nlisten. Jack\'s voice sounded to him like heaven.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o\'clock William bade his son good-night.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, my boy; perhaps we shan\'t see each other again. This may be\r\nmy last night."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t leave you, father."\r\n\r\n"No, my boy, go to your bed. I feel I\'d like to be alone with mother." The\r\nvoice sank almost to a whisper.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll remember what you promised me about racing.... Be good to your\r\nmother--she\'s the best mother a son ever had."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll work for mother, father, I\'ll work for her."\r\n\r\n"You\'re too young, my son, but when you\'re older I hope you\'ll work for\r\nher. She worked for you.... Good-bye, my boy."\r\n\r\nThe dying man sweated profusely, and Esther wiped his face from time to\r\ntime. Mrs. Collins came in. She had a large tin candlestick in her hand in\r\nwhich there was a fragment of candle end. He motioned to her to put it\r\naside. She put it on the table out of the way of his eyes.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll help Esther to lay me out.... I don\'t want any one else. I don\'t\r\nlike the other woman."\r\n\r\n"Esther and me will lay you out, make your mind easy; none but we two\r\nshall touch you."\r\n\r\nOnce more Esther wiped his forehead, and he signed to her how he wished\r\nthe bed-clothes to be arranged, for he could no longer speak. Mrs. Collins\r\nwhispered to Esther that she did not think that the end could be far off,\r\nand compelled by a morbid sort of curiosity she took a chair and sat down.\r\nEsther wiped away the little drops of sweat as they came upon his\r\nforehead; his chest and throat had to be wiped also, for they too were\r\nfull of sweat. His eyes were fixed on the darkness and he moved his hand\r\nrestlessly, and Esther always understood what he wanted. She gave him a\r\nlittle brandy-and-water, and when he could not take it from the glass she\r\ngave it to him with a spoon.\r\n\r\nThe silence grew more solemn, and the clock on the mantelpiece striking\r\nten sharp strokes did not interrupt it; and then, as Esther turned from\r\nthe bedside for the brandy, Mrs. Collins\'s candle spluttered and went out;\r\na little thread of smoke evaporated, leaving only a morsel of blackened\r\nwick; the flame had disappeared for ever, gone as if it had never been,\r\nand Esther saw darkness where there had been a light. Then she heard Mrs.\r\nCollins say--\r\n\r\n"I think it is all over, dear."\r\n\r\nThe profile on the pillow seemed very little.\r\n\r\n"Hold up his head, so that if there is any breath it may come on the\r\nglass."\r\n\r\n"He\'s dead, right enough. You see, dear, there\'s not a trace of breath on\r\nthe glass."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to say a prayer. Will you say a prayer with me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I feel as if I should like to myself; it eases the heart wonderful."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV\r\n\r\n\r\nShe stood on the platform watching the receding train. A few bushes hid\r\nthe curve of the line; the white vapour rose above them, evaporating in\r\nthe grey evening. A moment more and the last carriage would pass out of\r\nsight. The white gates swung slowly forward and closed over the line.\r\n\r\nAn oblong box painted reddish brown lay on the seat beside her. A woman of\r\nseven or eight and thirty, stout and strongly built, short arms and\r\nhard-worked hands, dressed in dingy black skirt and a threadbare jacket\r\ntoo thin for the dampness of a November day. Her face was a blunt outline,\r\nand the grey eyes reflected all the natural prose of the Saxon.\r\n\r\nThe porter told her that he would try to send her box up to Woodview\r\nto-morrow.... That was the way to Woodview, right up the lane. She could\r\nnot miss it. She would find the lodge gate behind that clump of trees. And\r\nthinking how she could get her box to Woodview that evening, she looked at\r\nthe barren strip of country lying between the downs and the shingle beach.\r\nThe little town clamped about its deserted harbour seemed more than ever\r\nlike falling to pieces like a derelict vessel, and when Esther passed over\r\nthe level crossing she noticed that the line of little villas had not\r\nincreased; they were as she had left them eighteen years ago, laurels,\r\niron railing, antimacassars. It was about eighteen years ago, on a\r\nbeautiful June day, that she had passed up this lane for the first time.\r\nAt the very spot she was now passing she had stopped to wonder if she\r\nwould be able to keep the place of kitchen-maid. She remembered regretting\r\nthat she had not a new dress; she had hoped to be able to brighten up the\r\nbest of her cotton prints with a bit of red ribbon. The sun was shining,\r\nand she had met William leaning over the paling in the avenue smoking his\r\npipe. Eighteen years had gone by, eighteen years of labour, suffering,\r\ndisappointment. A great deal had happened, so much that she could not\r\nremember it all. The situations she had been in; her life with that dear\r\ngood soul, Miss Rice, then Fred Parsons, then William again; her marriage,\r\nthe life in the public-house, money lost and money won, heart-breakings,\r\ndeath, everything that could happen had happened to her. Now it all seemed\r\nlike a dream. But her boy remained to her. She had brought up her boy,\r\nthank God, she had been able to do that. But how had she done it? How\r\noften had she found herself within sight of the workhouse? The last time\r\nwas no later than last week. Last week it had seemed to her that she would\r\nhave to accept the workhouse. But she had escaped, and now here she was\r\nback at the very point from which she started, going back to Woodview,\r\ngoing back to Mrs. Barfield\'s service.\r\n\r\nWilliam\'s illness and his funeral had taken Esther\'s last few pounds away\r\nfrom her, and when she and Jack came back from the cemetery she found that\r\nshe had broken into her last sovereign. She clasped him to her bosom--he\r\nwas a tall boy of fifteen--and burst into tears. But she did not tell him\r\nwhat she was crying for. She did not say, "God only knows how we shall\r\nfind bread to eat next week;" she merely said, wiping away her tears, "We\r\ncan\'t afford to live here any longer. It\'s too expensive for us now that\r\nfather\'s gone." And they went to live in a slum for three-and-sixpence a\r\nweek. If she had been alone in the world she would have gone into a\r\nsituation, but she could not leave the boy, and so she had to look out for\r\ncharing. It was hard to have to come down to this, particularly when she\r\nremembered that she had had a house and a servant of her own; but there\r\nwas nothing for it but to look out for some charing, and get along as best\r\nshe could until Jack was able to look after himself. But the various\r\nscrubbings and general cleaning that had come her way had been so badly\r\npaid that she soon found that she could not make both ends meet. She would\r\nhave to leave her boy and go out as a general servant. And as her\r\nnecessities were pressing, she accepted a situation in a coffee-shop in\r\nthe London Road. She would give all her wages to Jack, seven shillings a\r\nweek, and he would have to live on that. So long as she had her health she\r\ndid not mind.\r\n\r\nIt was a squat brick building with four windows that looked down on the\r\npavement with a short-sighted stare. On each window was written in letters\r\nof white enamel, "Well-aired beds." A board nailed to a post by the\r\nside-door announced that tea and coffee were always ready. On the other\r\nside of the sign was an upholsterer\'s, and the vulgar brightness of the\r\nBrussels carpets seemed in keeping with the slop-like appearance of the\r\ncoffeehouse.\r\n\r\nSometimes a workman came in the morning; a couple more might come in about\r\ndinner-time. Sometimes they took rashers and bits of steak out of their\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you cook this for me, missis?"\r\n\r\nBut it was not until about nine in the evening that the real business of\r\nthe house began, and it continued till one, when the last straggler\r\nknocked for admittance. The house lived on its beds. The best rooms were\r\nsometimes let for eight shillings a night, and there were four beds which\r\nwere let at fourpence a night in the cellar under the area where Esther\r\nstood by the great copper washing sheets, blankets, and counterpanes, when\r\nshe was not cleaning the rooms upstairs. There was a double-bedded room\r\nunderneath the kitchen, and over the landings, wherever a space could be\r\nfound, the landlord, who was clever at carpentering work, had fitted up\r\nsome sort of closet place that could be let as a bedroom. The house was a\r\nhoneycomb. The landlord slept under the roof, and a corner had been found\r\nfor his housekeeper, a handsome young woman, at the end of the passage.\r\nEsther and the children--the landlord was a widower--slept in the\r\ncoffee-room upon planks laid across the tops of the high backs of the\r\nbenches where the customers mealed. Mattresses and bedding were laid on\r\nthese planks and the sleepers lay, their faces hardly two feet from the\r\nceiling. Esther slept with the baby, a little boy of five; the two big\r\nboys slept at the other end of the room by the front door. The eldest was\r\nabout fifteen, but he was only half-witted; and he helped in the\r\nhousework, and could turn down the beds and see quicker than any one if\r\nthe occupant had stolen sheet or blanket. Esther always remembered how he\r\nwould raise himself up in bed in the early morning, rub the glass, and\r\nlight a candle so that he could be seen from below. He shook his head if\r\nevery bed was occupied, or signed with his fingers the prices of the beds\r\nif they had any to let.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was a tall, thin man, with long features and hair turning\r\ngrey. He was very quiet, and Esther was surprised one night at the\r\nabruptness with which he stopped a couple who were going upstairs.\r\n\r\n"Is that your wife?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she\'s my wife all right."\r\n\r\n"She don\'t look very old."\r\n\r\n"She\'s older than she looks."\r\n\r\nThen he said, half to Esther, half to his housekeeper, that it was hard to\r\nknow what to do. If you asked them for their marriage certificates they\'d\r\nbe sure to show you something. The housekeeper answered that they paid\r\nwell, and that was the principal thing. But when an attempt was made to\r\nsteal the bedclothes the landlord and his housekeeper were more severe. As\r\nEsther was about to let a most respectable woman out of the front door,\r\nthe idiot boy called down the stairs, "Stop her! There\'s a sheet missing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what in the world is all this? I haven\'t got your sheet. Pray let me\r\npass; I\'m in a hurry."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t let you pass until the sheet is found."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find it upstairs under the bed. It\'s got mislaid. I\'m in a hurry."\r\n\r\n"Call in the police," shouted the idiot boy.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better come upstairs and help me to find the sheet," said Esther.\r\n\r\nThe woman hesitated a moment, and then walked up in front of Esther. When\r\nthey were in the bedroom she shook out her petticoats, and the sheet fell\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\n"There, now," said Esther, "a nice botheration you\'d \'ve got me into. I\r\nshould\'ve had to pay for it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I could pay for it; it was only because I\'m not very well off at\r\npresent."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you _will_ pay for it if you don\'t take care," said Esther.\r\n\r\nIt was very soon after that Esther had her mother\'s books stolen from her.\r\nThey had not been doing much business, and she had been put to sleep in\r\none of the bedrooms. The room was suddenly wanted, and she had no time to\r\nmove all her things, and when she went to make up the room she found that\r\nher mother\'s books and a pair of jet earrings that Fred had given her had\r\nbeen stolen. She could do nothing; the couple who had occupied the room\r\nwere far away by this time. There was no hope of ever recovering her books\r\nand earrings, and the loss of these things caused her a great deal of\r\nunhappiness. The only little treasure she possessed were those earrings;\r\nnow they were gone, she realised how utterly alone she was in the world.\r\nIf her health were to break down to-morrow she would have to go to the\r\nworkhouse. What would become of her boy? She was afraid to think; thinking\r\ndid no good. She must not think, but must just work on, washing the\r\nbedclothes until she could wash no longer. Wash, wash, all the week long;\r\nand it was only by working on till one o\'clock in the morning that she\r\nsometimes managed to get the Sabbath free from washing. Never, not even in\r\nthe house in Chelsea, had she had such hard work, and she was not as\r\nstrong now as she was then. But her courage did not give way until one\r\nSunday Jack came to tell her that the people who employed him had sold\r\ntheir business.\r\n\r\nThen a strange weakness came over her. She thought of the endless week of\r\nwork that awaited her in the cellar, the great copper on the fire, the\r\nheaps of soiled linen in the corner, the steam rising from the wash-tub,\r\nand she felt she had not sufficient strength to get through another week\r\nof such work. She looked at her son with despair in her eyes. She had\r\nwhispered to him as he lay asleep under her shawl, a tiny infant, "There\r\nis nothing for us, my poor boy, but the workhouse," and the same thought\r\nrose up in her mind as she looked at him, a tall lad with large grey eyes\r\nand dark curling hair. But she did not trouble him with her despair. She\r\nmerely said--\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how we shall pull through, Jack. God will help us."\r\n\r\n"You\'re washing too hard, mother. You\'re wasting away. Do you know no one,\r\nmother, who could help us?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at Jack fixedly, and she thought of Mrs. Barfield. Mrs.\r\nBarfield might be away in the South with her daughter. If she were at\r\nWoodview Esther felt sure that she would not refuse to help her. So Jack\r\nwrote at Esther\'s dictation, and before they expected an answer, a letter\r\ncame from Mrs. Barfield saying that she remembered Esther perfectly well.\r\nShe had just returned from the South. She was all alone at Woodview, and\r\nwanted a servant. Esther could come and take the place if she liked. She\r\nenclosed five pounds, and hoped that the money would enable Esther to\r\nleave London at once.\r\n\r\nBut this returning to former conditions filled Esther with strange\r\ntrouble. Her heart beat as she recognised the spire of the church between\r\nthe trees, and the undulating line of downs behind the trees awakened\r\npainful recollections. She knew the white gate was somewhere in this\r\nplantation, but could not remember its exact position; and she took the\r\nroad to the left instead of taking the road to the right, and had to\r\nretrace her steps. The gate had fallen from its hinge, and she had some\r\ndifficulty in opening it. The lodge where the blind gatekeeper used to\r\nplay the flute was closed; the park paling had not been kept in repair;\r\nwandering sheep and cattle had worn away the great holly hedge; and Esther\r\nnoticed that in falling an elm had broken through the garden wall.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived at the iron gate under the bunched evergreens, her steps\r\npaused. For this was where she had met William for the first time. He had\r\ntaken her through the stables and pointed out to her Silver Braid\'s box.\r\nShe remembered the horses going to the downs, horses coming from the\r\ndowns--stabling and the sound of hoofs everywhere. But now silence. She\r\ncould see that many a roof had fallen, and that ruins of outhouses filled\r\nthe yard. She remembered the kitchen windows, bright in the setting sun,\r\nand the white-capped servants moving about the great white table. But now\r\nthe shutters were up, nowhere a light; the knocker had disappeared from\r\nthe door, and she asked herself how she was to get in. She even felt\r\nafraid.... Supposing she should not find Mrs. Barfield. She made her way\r\nthrough the shrubbery, tripping over fallen branches and trunks of trees;\r\nrooks rose out of the evergreens with a great clatter, her heart stood\r\nstill, and she hardly dared to tear herself through the mass of underwood.\r\nAt last she gained the lawn, and, still very frightened, sought for the\r\nbell. The socket plate hung loose on the wire, and only a faint tinkle\r\ncame through the solitude of the empty house.\r\n\r\nAt last footsteps and a light; the chained door was opened a little, and a\r\nvoice asked who it was. Esther explained; the door was opened, and she\r\nstood face to face with her old mistress. Mrs. Barfield stood, holding the\r\ncandle high, so that she could see Esther. Esther knew her at once. She\r\nhad not changed very much. She kept her beautiful white teeth and her\r\ngirlish smile; the pointed, vixen-like face had not altered in outline,\r\nbut the reddish hair was so thin that it had to be parted on the side and\r\ndrawn over the skull; her figure was delicate and sprightly as ever.\r\nEsther noticed all this, and Mrs. Barfield noticed that Esther had grown\r\nstouter. Her face was still pleasant to see, for it kept that look of\r\nblunt, honest nature which had always been its charm. She was now the\r\nthick-set working woman of forty, and she stood holding the hem of her\r\njacket in her rough hands.\r\n\r\n"We\'d better put the chain up, for I\'m alone in the house."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you afraid, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"A little, but there\'s nothing to steal. I asked the policeman to keep a\r\nlook-out. Come into the library."\r\n\r\nThere was the round table, the little green sofa, the piano, the parrot\'s\r\ncage, and the yellow-painted presses; and it seemed only a little while\r\nsince she had been summoned to this room, since she had stood facing her\r\nmistress, her confession on her lips. It seemed like yesterday, and yet\r\nseventeen years and more had gone by. And all these years were now a sort\r\nof a blur in her mind--a dream, the connecting links of which were gone,\r\nand she stood face to face with her old mistress in the old room.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve had a cold journey, Esther; you\'d like some tea?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t trouble, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no trouble; I should like some myself. The fire\'s out in the\r\nkitchen. We can boil the kettle here."\r\n\r\nThey went through the baize door into the long passage. Mrs. Barfield told\r\nEsther where was the pantry, the kitchen, and the larder. Esther answered\r\nthat she remembered quite well, and it seemed to her not a little strange\r\nthat she should know these things. Mrs. Barfield said--\r\n\r\n"So you haven\'t forgotten Woodview, Esther?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am. It seems like yesterday.... But I\'m afraid the damp has got\r\ninto the kitchen, ma\'am, the range is that neglected----"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Woodview isn\'t what it was."\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield told how she had buried her husband in the old village\r\nchurch. She had taken her daughter to Egypt; she had dwindled there till\r\nthere was little more than a skeleton to lay in the grave.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am, I know how it takes them, inch by inch. My husband died of\r\nconsumption."\r\n\r\nThey sat talking for hours. One thing led to another and Esther gradually\r\ntold Mrs. Barfield the story of her life from the day they bade each other\r\ngood-bye in the room they were now sitting in.\r\n\r\n"It is quite a romance, Esther."\r\n\r\n"It was a hard fight, and it isn\'t over yet, ma\'am. It won\'t be over until\r\nI see him settled in some regular work. I hope I shall live to see him\r\nsettled."\r\n\r\nThey sat over the fire a long time without speaking. Mrs. Barfield said--\r\n\r\n"It must be getting on for bedtime."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it must, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nShe asked if she should sleep in the room she had once shared with\r\nMargaret Gale. Mrs. Barfield answered with a sigh that as all the bedrooms\r\nwere empty Esther had better sleep in the room next to hers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI\r\n\r\n\r\nEsther seemed to have quite naturally accepted Woodview as a final stage.\r\nAny further change in her life she did not seem to regard as possible or\r\ndesirable. One of these days her boy would get settled; he would come down\r\nnow and again to see her. She did not want any more than that. No, she did\r\nnot find the place lonely. A young girl might, but she was no longer a\r\nyoung girl; she had her work to do, and when it was done she was glad to\r\nsit down to rest.\r\n\r\nAnd, dressed in long cloaks, the women went for walks together; sometimes\r\nthey went up the hill, sometimes into Southwick to make some little\r\npurchases. On Sundays they walked to Beeding to attend meeting. And they\r\ncame home along the winter roads, the peace and happiness of prayer upon\r\ntheir faces, holding their skirts out of the mud, unashamed of their\r\ncommon boots. They made no acquaintances, seeming to find in each other\r\nall necessary companionship. Their heads bent a little forward, they\r\ntrudged home, talking of what they were in the habit of talking, that\r\nanother tree had been blown down, that Jack was now earning good\r\nmoney--ten shillings a week. Esther hoped it would last. Or else Esther\r\ntold her mistress that she had heard that one of Mr. Arthur\'s horses had\r\nwon a race. He lived in the North of England, where he had a small\r\ntraining stable, and his mother never heard of him except through the\r\nsporting papers. "He hasn\'t been here for four years," Mrs. Barfield said;\r\n"he hates the place; he wouldn\'t care if I were to burn it down\r\nto-morrow.... However, I do the best I can, hoping that one day he\'ll\r\nmarry and come and live here."\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur--that was how Mrs. Barfield and Esther spoke of him--did not\r\ndraw any income from the estate. The rents only sufficed to pay the\r\ncharges and the widow\'s jointure. All the land was let; the house he had\r\ntried to let, but it had been found impossible to find a tenant, unless\r\nMr. Arthur would expend some considerable sum in putting the house and\r\ngrounds into a state of proper repair. This he did not care to do; he said\r\nthat he found race-horses a more profitable speculation. Besides, even the\r\npark had been let on lease; nothing remained to him but the house and lawn\r\nand garden; he could no longer gallop a horse on the hill without\r\nsomebody\'s leave, so he didn\'t care what became of the place. His mother\r\nmight go on living there, keeping things together as she called it; he did\r\nnot mind what she did as long as she didn\'t bother him. So did he express\r\nhimself regarding Woodview on the rare occasion of his visits, and when he\r\ntroubled to answer his mother\'s letters. Mrs. Barfield, whose thoughts\r\nwere limited to the estate, was pained by his indifference; she gradually\r\nceased to consult him, and when Beeding was too far for her to walk she\r\nhad the furniture removed from the drawing-room and a long deal table\r\nplaced there instead. She had not asked herself if Arthur would object to\r\nher inviting a few brethren of the neighbourhood to her house for meeting,\r\nor publishing the meetings by notices posted on the lodge gate.\r\n\r\nOne day Mrs. Barfield and Esther were walking in the avenue, when, to\r\ntheir surprise, they saw Mr. Arthur open the white gate and come through.\r\nThe mother hastened forward to meet her son, but paused, dismayed by the\r\nanger that looked out of his eyes. He did not like the notices, and she\r\nwas sorry that he was annoyed. She didn\'t think that he would mind them,\r\nand she hastened by his side, pleading her excuses. But to her great\r\nsorrow Arthur did not seem to be able to overcome his annoyance. He\r\nrefused to listen, and continued his reproaches, saying the things that he\r\nknew would most pain her.\r\n\r\nHe did not care whether the trees stood or fell, whether the cement\r\nremained upon the walls or dropped from them; he didn\'t draw a penny of\r\nincome from the place, and did not care a damn what became of it. He\r\nallowed her to live there, she got her jointure out of the property, and\r\nhe didn\'t want to interfere with her, but what he could not stand was the\r\nsnuffy little folk from the town coming round his house. The Barfields at\r\nleast were county, and he wished Woodview to remain county as long as the\r\nwalls held together. He wasn\'t a bit ashamed of all this ruin. You could\r\nreceive the Prince of Wales in a ruin, but he wouldn\'t care to ask him\r\ninto a dissenting chapel. Mrs. Barfield answered that she didn\'t see how\r\nthe mere assembling of a few friends in prayer could disgrace a house. She\r\ndid not know that he objected to her asking them. She would not ask them\r\nany more. The only thing was that there was no place nearer than Beeding\r\nwhere they could meet, and she could no longer walk so far. She would have\r\nto give up meeting.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me a strange taste to want to kneel down with a lot of little\r\nshop-keepers.... Is this where you kneel?" he said, pointing to the long\r\ndeal table. "The place is a regular little Bethel."\r\n\r\n"Our Lord said that when a number should gather together for prayer that\r\nHe would be among them. Those are true words, and as we get old we feel\r\nmore and more the want of this communion of spirit. It is only then that\r\nwe feel that we\'re really with God.... The folk that you despise are equal\r\nin His sight. And living here alone, what should I be without prayer? and\r\nEsther, after her life of trouble and strife, what would she be without\r\nprayer?... It is our consolation."\r\n\r\n"I think one should choose one\'s company for prayer as for everything\r\nelse. Besides, what do you get out of it? Miracles don\'t happen nowadays."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very young, Arthur, and you cannot feel the want of prayer as we\r\ndo--two old women living in this lonely house. As age and solitude\r\novertake us, the realities of life float away and we become more and more\r\nsensible to the mystery which surrounds us. And our Lord Jesus Christ gave\r\nus love and prayer so that we might see a little further."\r\n\r\nAn expression of great beauty came upon her face, that unconscious\r\nresignation which, like the twilight, hallows and transforms. In such\r\nmoments the humblest hearts are at one with nature, and speaks out of the\r\neternal wisdom of things. So even this common racing man was touched, and\r\nhe said--\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry if I said anything to hurt your religious feelings."\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Do you not accept my apologies, mother?"\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, what do I care for your apologies; what are they to me? All\r\nI think of now is your conversion to Christ. Nothing else matters. I shall\r\nalways pray for that."\r\n\r\n"You may have whom you like up here; I don\'t mind if it makes you happy.\r\nI\'m ashamed of myself. Don\'t let\'s say any more about it. I\'m only down\r\nfor the day. I\'m going home to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Home, Arthur! this is your home. I can\'t bear to hear you speak of any\r\nother place as your home."\r\n\r\n"Well, mother, then I shall say that I\'m going back to business\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield sighed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII\r\n\r\n\r\nDays, weeks, months passed away, and the two women came to live more and\r\nmore like friends and less like mistress and maid. Not that Esther ever\r\nfailed to use the respectful "ma\'am" when she addressed her mistress, nor\r\ndid they ever sit down to a meal at the same table. But these slight\r\nsocial distinctions, which habit naturally preserved, and which it would\r\nhave been disagreeable to both to forego, were no check on the intimacy of\r\ntheir companionship. In the evening they sat in the library sewing, or\r\nMrs. Barfield read aloud, or they talked of their sons. On Sundays they\r\nhad their meetings. The folk came from quite a distance, and sometimes as\r\nmany as five-and-twenty knelt round the deal table in the drawing room,\r\nand Esther felt that these days were the happiest of her life. She was\r\ncontent in the peaceful present, and she knew that Mrs. Barfield would not\r\nleave her unprovided for. She was almost free from anxiety. But Jack did\r\nnot seem to be able to obtain regular employment in London, and her wages\r\nwere so small that she could not help him much. So the sight of his\r\nhandwriting made her tremble, and she sometimes did not show the letter to\r\nMrs. Barfield for some hours after.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday morning, after meeting, as the two women were going for their\r\nwalk up the hill, Esther said--\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a letter from my boy, ma\'am. I hope it is to tell me that he\'s got\r\nback to work."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I shan\'t be able to read it, Esther. I haven\'t my glasses with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"It don\'t matter, ma\'am--it\'ll keep."\r\n\r\n"Give it to me--his writing is large and legible. I think I can read it.\r\n\'My dear mother, the place I told you of in my last letter was given away,\r\nso I must go on in the toy-shop till something better turns up. I only get\r\nsix shillings a week and my tea, and can\'t quite manage on that.\' Then\r\nsomething--something--\'pay three and sixpence a week\'--something--\'bed\'\r\n--something--something."\r\n\r\n"I know, ma\'am; he shares a bed with the eldest boy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s it; and he wants to know if you can help him. \'I don\'t like\r\nto trouble you, mother; but it is hard for a boy to get his living in\r\nLondon.\'"\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve sent him all my money. I shan\'t have any till next quarter."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll lend you some, Esther. We can\'t leave the boy to starve. He can\'t\r\nlive on two and sixpence a week."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very good, ma\'am; but I don\'t like to take your money. We shan\'t\r\nbe able to get the garden cleared this winter."\r\n\r\n"We shall manage somehow, Esther. The garden must wait. The first thing to\r\ndo is to see that your boy doesn\'t want for food."\r\n\r\nThe women resumed their walk up the hill. When they reached the top Mrs.\r\nBarfield said--\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t heard from Mr. Arthur for months. I envy you, Esther, those\r\nletters asking for a little money. What\'s the use of money to us except to\r\ngive it to our children? Helping others, that is the only happiness."\r\n\r\nAt the end of the coombe, under the shaws, stood the old red-tiled\r\nfarmhouse in which Mrs. Barfield had been born. Beyond it, downlands\r\nrolled on and on, reaching half-way up the northern sky. Mrs. Barfield was\r\nthinking of the days when her husband used to jump off his cob and walk\r\nbeside her through those gorse patches on his way to the farmhouse. She\r\nhad come from the farmhouse beneath the shaws to go to live in an Italian\r\nhouse sheltered by a fringe of trees. That was her adventure. She knew it,\r\nand she turned from the view of the downs to the view of the sea. The\r\nplantations of Woodview touched the horizon, then the line dipped, and\r\nbetween the top branches of a row of elms appeared the roofs of the town.\r\nOver a long spider-legged bridge a train wriggled like a snake, the bleak\r\nriver flowed into the harbour, and the shingle banks saved the low land\r\nfrom inundation. Then the train passed behind the square, dogmatic tower\r\nof the village church. Her husband lay beneath the chancel; her father,\r\nmother, all her relations, lay in the churchyard. She would go there in a\r\nfew years.... Her daughter lay far away, far away in Egypt. Upon this\r\ndownland all her life had been passed, all her life except the few months\r\nshe had spent by her daughter\'s bedside in Egypt. She had come from that\r\ncoombe, from that farmhouse beneath the shaws, and had only crossed the\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nAnd this barren landscape meant as much to Esther as to her mistress. It\r\nwas on these downs that she had walked with William. He had been born and\r\nbred on these downs; but he lay far away in Brompton Cemetery; it was she\r\nwho had come back! and in her simple way she too wondered at the mystery\r\nof destiny.\r\n\r\nAs they descended the hill Mrs. Barfield asked Esther if she ever heard of\r\nFred Parsons.\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, I don\'t know what\'s become of him."\r\n\r\n"And if you were to meet him again, would you care to marry him?"\r\n\r\n"Marry and begin life over again! All the worry and bother over again! Why\r\nshould I marry?--all I live for now is to see my boy settled in life."\r\n\r\nThe women walked on in silence, passing by long ruins of stables,\r\ncoach-houses, granaries, rickyards, all in ruin and decay. The women\r\npaused and went towards the garden; and removing some pieces of the broken\r\ngate they entered a miniature wilderness. The espalier apple-trees had\r\ndisappeared beneath climbing weeds, and long briars had shot out from the\r\nbushes, leaving few traces of the former walks--a damp, dismal place that\r\nthe birds seemed to have abandoned. Of the greenhouse only some broken\r\nglass and a black broken chimney remained. A great elm had carried away a\r\nlarge portion of the southern wall, and under the dripping trees an aged\r\npeacock screamed for his lost mate.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose that Jack will be able to find any more paying employment\r\nthis winter. We must send him six shillings a week; that, with what he is\r\nearning, will make twelve; he\'ll be able to live nicely on that."\r\n\r\n"I should think he would indeed. But, then, what about the wages of them\r\nwho was to have cleared the gardens for us?"\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t be able to get the whole garden cleared, but Jim will be able\r\nto get a piece ready for us to sow some spring vegetables, not a large\r\npiece, but enough for us. The first thing to do will be to cut down those\r\napple-trees. I\'m afraid we shall have to cut down that walnut; nothing\r\ncould grow beneath it. Did any one ever see such a mass of weed and briar?\r\nYet it is only about ten years since we left Woodview, and the garden was\r\nlet run to waste. Nature does not take long, a few years, a very few\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the winter the north wind roamed on the hills; many trees fell in the\r\npark, and at the end of February Woodview seemed barer and more desolate\r\nthan ever; broken branches littered the roadway, and the tall trunks\r\nshowed their wounds. The women sat over their fire in the evening\r\nlistening to the blast, cogitating the work that awaited them as soon as\r\nthe weather showed signs of breaking.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield had laid by a few pounds during the winter; and the day that\r\nJim cleared out the first piece of espalier trees she spent entirely in\r\nthe garden, hardly able to take her eyes off him. But the pleasure of the\r\nday was in a measure spoilt for her by the knowledge that on that day her\r\nson was riding in the great steeplechase. She was full of fear for his\r\nsafety; she did not sleep that night, and hurried down at an early hour to\r\nthe garden to ask Jim for the newspaper which she had told him to bring\r\nher. He took some time to extract the paper from his torn pocket.\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t in the first three," said Mrs. Barfield. "I always know that\r\nhe\'s safe if he\'s in the first three. We must turn to the account of the\r\nrace to see if there were any accidents."\r\n\r\nShe turned over the paper.\r\n\r\n"Thank God, he\'s safe," she said; "his horse ran fourth."\r\n\r\n"You worry yourself without cause, ma\'am. A good rider like him don\'t meet\r\nwith accidents."\r\n\r\n"The best riders are often killed, Esther. I never have an easy moment\r\nwhen I hear he\'s going to ride in these races. Supposing one day I were to\r\nread that he was carried back on a shutter."\r\n\r\n"We mustn\'t let our thoughts run on such things, ma\'am. If a war was to\r\nbreak out to-morrow, what should I do? His regiment would be ordered out.\r\nIt is sad to think that he had to enlist. But, as he said, he couldn\'t go\r\non living on me any longer. Poor boy! ...We must keep on working, doing\r\nthe best we can for them. There are all sorts of chances, and we can only\r\npray that God may spare them."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Esther, that\'s all we can do. Work on, work on to the end.... But\r\nyour boy is coming to see you to-day."\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am, he\'ll be here by twelve o\'clock.\'"\r\n\r\n"You\'re luckier than I am. I wonder if I shall ever see my boy again."\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am, of course you will. He\'ll come back to you right enough one\r\nof these days. There\'s a good time coming; that\'s what I always says....\r\nAnd now I\'ve got work to do in the house. Are you going to stop here, or\r\nare you coming in with me? It\'ll do you no good standing about in the wet\r\nclay."\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield smiled and nodded, and Esther paused at the broken gate to\r\nwatch her mistress, who stood superintending the clearing away of ten\r\nyears\' growth of weeds, as much interested in the prospect of a few peas\r\nand cabbages as in former days she had been in the culture of expensive\r\nflowers. She stood on what remained of a gravel walk, the heavy clay\r\nclinging to her boots, watching Jim piling weeds upon his barrow. Would he\r\nbe able to finish the plot of ground by the end of the week? What should\r\nthey do with that great walnut-tree? Nothing would grow underneath it. Jim\r\nwas afraid that he would not be able to cut it down and remove it without\r\nhelp. Mrs. Barfield suggested sawing away some of the branches, but Jim\r\nwas not sure that the expedient would prove of much avail. In his opinion\r\nthe tree took all the goodness out of the soil, and that while it stood\r\nthey could not expect a very great show of vegetables. Mrs. Barfield asked\r\nif the sale of the tree trunk would indemnify her for the cost of cutting\r\nit down. Jim paused in his work, and, leaning on his spade, considered if\r\nthere was any one in the town, who, for the sake of the timber, would cut\r\nthe tree down and take it away for nothing. There ought to be some such\r\nperson in town; if it came to that, Mrs. Barfield ought to receive\r\nsomething for the tree. Walnut was a valuable wood, was extensively used\r\nby cabinetmakers, and so on, until Mrs. Barfield begged him to get on with\r\nhis digging.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock Esther and Mrs. Barfield walked out on the lawn. A loud\r\nwind came up from the sea, and it shook the evergreens as if it were angry\r\nwith them. A rook carried a stick to the tops of the tall trees, and the\r\nwomen drew their cloaks about them. The train passed across the vista, and\r\nthe women wondered how long it would take Jack to walk from the station.\r\nThen another rook stooped to the edge of the plantation, gathered a twig,\r\nand carried it away. The wind was rough; it caught the evergreens\r\nunderneath and blew them out like umbrellas; the grass had not yet begun\r\nto grow, and the grey sea harmonised with the grey-green land. The women\r\nwaited on the windy lawn, their skirts blown against their legs, keeping\r\ntheir hats on with difficulty. It was too cold for standing still. They\r\nturned and walked a few steps towards the house, and then looked round.\r\n\r\nA tall soldier came through the gate. He wore a long red cloak, and a\r\nsmall cap jauntily set on the side of his close-clipped head. Esther\r\nuttered a little exclamation, and ran to meet him. He took his mother in\r\nhis arms, kissed her, and they walked towards Mrs. Barfield together. All\r\nwas forgotten in the happiness of the moment--the long fight for his life,\r\nand the possibility that any moment might declare him to be mere food for\r\npowder and shot. She was only conscious that she had accomplished her\r\nwoman\'s work--she had brought him up to man\'s estate; and that was her\r\nsufficient reward. What a fine fellow he was! She did not know he was so\r\nhandsome, and blushing with pleasure and pride she glanced shyly at him\r\nout of the corners of her eyes as she introduced him to her mistress.\r\n\r\n"This is my son, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nMrs. Barfield held out her hand to the young soldier.\r\n\r\n"I have heard a great deal about you from your mother."\r\n\r\n"And I of you, ma\'am. You\'ve been very kind to my mother. I don\'t know how\r\nto thank you."\r\n\r\nAnd in silence they walked towards the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Esther Waters, by George Moore\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ESTHER WATERS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 8157.txt or 8157.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/8/1/5/8157/\r\n\r\nProduced by Eric Eldred, Clay Massei, Charles Franks, and\r\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
