I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI visited Naples in the year 1818. On the 8th of December of that year,\r\nmy companion and I crossed the Bay, to visit the antiquities which are\r\nscattered on the shores of Bai\xc3\xa6. The translucent and shining waters of\r\nthe calm sea covered fragments of old Roman villas, which were\r\ninterlaced by sea-weed, and received diamond tints from the chequering\r\nof the sun-beams; the blue and pellucid element was such as Galatea\r\nmight have skimmed in her car of mother of pearl; or Cleopatra, more\r\nfitly than the Nile, have chosen as the path of her magic ship. Though\r\nit was winter, the atmosphere seemed more appropriate to early spring;\r\nand its genial warmth contributed to inspire those sensations of placid\r\ndelight, which are the portion of every traveller, as he lingers, loath\r\nto quit the tranquil bays and radiant promontories of Bai\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nWe visited the so called Elysian Fields and Avernus; and wandered\r\nthrough various ruined temples, baths, and classic spots; at length we\r\nentered the gloomy cavern of the Cum\xc3\xa6an Sibyl. Our Lazzeroni bore\r\nflaring torches, which shone red, and almost dusky, in the murky\r\nsubterranean passages, whose darkness thirstily surrounding them,\r\nseemed eager to imbibe more and more of the element of light. We passed\r\nby a natural archway, leading to a second gallery, and enquired, if we\r\ncould not enter there also. The guides pointed to the reflection of\r\ntheir torches on the water that paved it, leaving us to form our own\r\nconclusion; but adding it was a pity, for it led to the Sibyl\xe2\x80\x99s Cave.\r\nOur curiosity and enthusiasm were excited by this circumstance, and we\r\ninsisted upon attempting the passage. As is usually the case in the\r\nprosecution of such enterprizes, the difficulties decreased on\r\nexamination. We found, on each side of the humid pathway, \xe2\x80\x9cdry land for\r\nthe sole of the foot.\xe2\x80\x9d At length we arrived at a large, desert, dark\r\ncavern, which the Lazzeroni assured us was the Sibyl\xe2\x80\x99s Cave. We were\r\nsufficiently disappointed\xe2\x80\x94Yet we examined it with care, as if its\r\nblank, rocky walls could still bear trace of celestial visitant. On one\r\nside was a small opening. Whither does this lead? we asked: can we\r\nenter here?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Questo poi, no,_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said the wild looking savage, who held\r\nthe torch; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can advance but a short distance, and nobody visits\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, I will try it,\xe2\x80\x9d said my companion; \xe2\x80\x9cit may lead to the\r\nreal cavern. Shall I go alone, or will you accompany me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI signified my readiness to proceed, but our guides protested against\r\nsuch a measure. With great volubility, in their native Neapolitan\r\ndialect, with which we were not very familiar, they told us that there\r\nwere spectres, that the roof would fall in, that it was too narrow to\r\nadmit us, that there was a deep hole within, filled with water, and we\r\nmight be drowned. My friend shortened the harangue, by taking the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntorch from him; and we proceeded alone.\r\n\r\nThe passage, which at first scarcely admitted us, quickly grew narrower\r\nand lower; we were almost bent double; yet still we persisted in making\r\nour way through it. At length we entered a wider space, and the low\r\nroof heightened; but, as we congratulated ourselves on this change, our\r\ntorch was extinguished by a current of air, and we were left in utter\r\ndarkness. The guides bring with them materials for renewing the light,\r\nbut we had none\xe2\x80\x94our only resource was to return as we came. We groped\r\nround the widened space to find the entrance, and after a time fancied\r\nthat we had succeeded. This proved however to be a second passage,\r\nwhich evidently ascended. It terminated like the former; though\r\nsomething approaching to a ray, we could not tell whence, shed a very\r\ndoubtful twilight in the space. By degrees, our eyes grew somewhat\r\naccustomed to this dimness, and we perceived that there was no direct\r\npassage leading us further; but that it was possible to climb one side\r\nof the cavern to a low arch at top, which promised a more easy path,\r\nfrom whence we now discovered that this light proceeded. With\r\nconsiderable difficulty we scrambled up, and came to another passage\r\nwith still more of illumination, and this led to another ascent like\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nAfter a succession of these, which our resolution alone permitted us to\r\nsurmount, we arrived at a wide cavern with an arched dome-like roof. An\r\naperture in the midst let in the light of heaven; but this was\r\novergrown with brambles and underwood, which acted as a veil, obscuring\r\nthe day, and giving a solemn religious hue to the apartment. It was\r\nspacious, and nearly circular, with a raised seat of stone, about the\r\nsize of a Grecian couch, at one end. The only sign that life had been\r\nhere, was the perfect snow-white skeleton of a goat, which had probably\r\nnot perceived the opening as it grazed on the hill above, and had\r\nfallen headlong. Ages perhaps had elapsed since this catastrophe; and\r\nthe ruin it had made above, had been repaired by the growth of\r\nvegetation during many hundred summers.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the furniture of the cavern consisted of piles of leaves,\r\nfragments of bark, and a white filmy substance, resembling the inner\r\npart of the green hood which shelters the grain of the unripe Indian\r\ncorn. We were fatigued by our struggles to attain this point, and\r\nseated ourselves on the rocky couch, while the sounds of tinkling\r\nsheep-bells, and shout of shepherd-boy, reached us from above.\r\n\r\nAt length my friend, who had taken up some of the leaves strewed about,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThis _is_ the Sibyl\xe2\x80\x99s cave; these are Sibylline leaves.\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nexamination, we found that all the leaves, bark, and other substances,\r\nwere traced with written characters. What appeared to us more\r\nastonishing, was that these writings were expressed in various\r\nlanguages: some unknown to my companion, ancient Chaldee, and Egyptian\r\nhieroglyphics, old as the Pyramids. Stranger still, some were in modern\r\ndialects, English and Italian. We could make out little by the dim\r\nlight, but they seemed to contain prophecies, detailed relations of\r\nevents but lately passed; names, now well known, but of modern date;\r\nand often exclamations of exultation or woe, of victory or defeat, were\r\ntraced on their thin scant pages. This was certainly the Sibyl\xe2\x80\x99s Cave;\r\nnot indeed exactly as Virgil describes it; but the whole of this land\r\nhad been so convulsed by earthquake and volcano, that the change was\r\nnot wonderful, though the traces of ruin were effaced by time; and we\r\nprobably owed the preservation of these leaves, to the accident which\r\nhad closed the mouth of the cavern, and the swift-growing vegetation\r\nwhich had rendered its sole opening impervious to the storm. We made a\r\nhasty selection of such of the leaves, whose writing one at least of us\r\ncould understand; and then, laden with our treasure, we bade adieu to\r\nthe dim hyp\xc3\xa6thric cavern, and after much difficulty succeeded in\r\nrejoining our guides.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Naples, we often returned to this cave, sometimes\r\nalone, skimming the sun-lit sea, and each time added to our store.\r\nSince that period, whenever the world\xe2\x80\x99s circumstance has not\r\nimperiously called me away, or the temper of my mind impeded such\r\nstudy, I have been employed in deciphering these sacred remains. Their\r\nmeaning, wondrous and eloquent, has often repaid my toil, soothing me\r\nin sorrow, and exciting my imagination to daring flights, through the\r\nimmensity of nature and the mind of man. For awhile my labours were not\r\nsolitary; but that time is gone; and, with the selected and matchless\r\ncompanion of my toils, their dearest reward is also lost to me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nDi mie tenere frondi altro lavoro\r\nCredea mostrarte; e qual fero pianeta\r\nNe\xe2\x80\x99 nvidi\xc3\xb2 insieme, o mio nobil tesoro?\r\n\r\n\r\nI present the public with my latest discoveries in the slight Sibylline\r\npages. Scattered and unconnected as they were, I have been obliged to\r\nadd links, and model the work into a consistent form. But the main\r\nsubstance rests on the truths contained in these poetic rhapsodies, and\r\nthe divine intuition which the Cum\xc3\xa6an damsel obtained from heaven.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered at the subject of her verses, and at the English\r\ndress of the Latin poet. Sometimes I have thought, that, obscure and\r\nchaotic as they are, they owe their present form to me, their\r\ndecipherer. As if we should give to another artist, the painted\r\nfragments which form the mosaic copy of Raphael\xe2\x80\x99s Transfiguration in\r\nSt. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s; he would put them together in a form, whose mode would be\r\nfashioned by his own peculiar mind and talent. Doubtless the leaves of\r\nthe Cum\xc3\xa6an Sibyl have suffered distortion and diminution of interest\r\nand excellence in my hands. My only excuse for thus transforming them,\r\nis that they were unintelligible in their pristine condition.\r\n\r\nMy labours have cheered long hours of solitude, and taken me out of a\r\nworld, which has averted its once benignant face from me, to one\r\nglowing with imagination and power. Will my readers ask how I could\r\nfind solace from the narration of misery and woeful change? This is one\r\nof the mysteries of our nature, which holds full sway over me, and from\r\nwhose influence I cannot escape. I confess, that I have not been\r\nunmoved by the development of the tale; and that I have been depressed,\r\nnay, agonized, at some parts of the recital, which I have faithfully\r\ntranscribed from my materials. Yet such is human nature, that the\r\nexcitement of mind was dear to me, and that the imagination, painter of\r\ntempest and earthquake, or, worse, the stormy and ruin-fraught passions\r\nof man, softened my real sorrows and endless regrets, by clothing these\r\nfictitious ones in that ideality, which takes the mortal sting from\r\npain.\r\n\r\nI hardly know whether this apology is necessary. For the merits of my\r\nadaptation and translation must decide how far I have well bestowed my\r\ntime and imperfect powers, in giving form and substance to the frail\r\nand attenuated Leaves of the Sibyl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am the native of a sea-surrounded nook, a cloud-enshadowed land,\r\nwhich, when the surface of the globe, with its shoreless ocean and\r\ntrackless continents, presents itself to my mind, appears only as an\r\ninconsiderable speck in the immense whole; and yet, when balanced in\r\nthe scale of mental power, far outweighed countries of larger extent\r\nand more numerous population. So true it is, that man\xe2\x80\x99s mind alone was\r\nthe creator of all that was good or great to man, and that Nature\r\nherself was only his first minister. England, seated far north in the\r\nturbid sea, now visits my dreams in the semblance of a vast and\r\nwell-manned ship, which mastered the winds and rode proudly over the\r\nwaves. In my boyish days she was the universe to me. When I stood on my\r\nnative hills, and saw plain and mountain stretch out to the utmost\r\nlimits of my vision, speckled by the dwellings of my countrymen, and\r\nsubdued to fertility by their labours, the earth\xe2\x80\x99s very centre was\r\nfixed for me in that spot, and the rest of her orb was as a fable, to\r\nhave forgotten which would have cost neither my imagination nor\r\nunderstanding an effort.\r\n\r\nMy fortunes have been, from the beginning, an exemplification of the\r\npower that mutability may possess over the varied tenor of man\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\nWith regard to myself, this came almost by inheritance. My father was\r\none of those men on whom nature had bestowed to prodigality the envied\r\ngifts of wit and imagination, and then left his bark of life to be\r\nimpelled by these winds, without adding reason as the rudder, or\r\njudgment as the pilot for the voyage. His extraction was obscure; but\r\ncircumstances brought him early into public notice, and his small\r\npaternal property was soon dissipated in the splendid scene of fashion\r\nand luxury in which he was an actor. During the short years of\r\nthoughtless youth, he was adored by the high-bred triflers of the day,\r\nnor least by the youthful sovereign, who escaped from the intrigues of\r\nparty, and the arduous duties of kingly business, to find never-failing\r\namusement and exhilaration of spirit in his society. My father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpulses, never under his own controul, perpetually led him into\r\ndifficulties from which his ingenuity alone could extricate him; and\r\nthe accumulating pile of debts of honour and of trade, which would have\r\nbent to earth any other, was supported by him with a light spirit and\r\ntameless hilarity; while his company was so necessary at the tables and\r\nassemblies of the rich, that his derelictions were considered venial,\r\nand he himself received with intoxicating flattery.\r\n\r\nThis kind of popularity, like every other, is evanescent: and the\r\ndifficulties of every kind with which he had to contend, increased in a\r\nfrightful ratio compared with his small means of extricating himself.\r\nAt such times the king, in his enthusiasm for him, would come to his\r\nrelief, and then kindly take his friend to task; my father gave the\r\nbest promises for amendment, but his social disposition, his craving\r\nfor the usual diet of admiration, and more than all, the fiend of\r\ngambling, which fully possessed him, made his good resolutions\r\ntransient, his promises vain. With the quick sensibility peculiar to\r\nhis temperament, he perceived his power in the brilliant circle to be\r\non the wane. The king married; and the haughty princess of Austria, who\r\nbecame, as queen of England, the head of fashion, looked with harsh\r\neyes on his defects, and with contempt on the affection her royal\r\nhusband entertained for him. My father felt that his fall was near; but\r\nso far from profiting by this last calm before the storm to save\r\nhimself, he sought to forget anticipated evil by making still greater\r\nsacrifices to the deity of pleasure, deceitful and cruel arbiter of his\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nThe king, who was a man of excellent dispositions, but easily led, had\r\nnow become a willing disciple of his imperious consort. He was induced\r\nto look with extreme disapprobation, and at last with distaste, on my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s imprudence and follies. It is true that his presence\r\ndissipated these clouds; his warm-hearted frankness, brilliant sallies,\r\nand confiding demeanour were irresistible: it was only when at a\r\ndistance, while still renewed tales of his errors were poured into his\r\nroyal friend\xe2\x80\x99s ear, that he lost his influence. The queen\xe2\x80\x99s dextrous\r\nmanagement was employed to prolong these absences, and gather together\r\naccusations. At length the king was brought to see in him a source of\r\nperpetual disquiet, knowing that he should pay for the short-lived\r\npleasure of his society by tedious homilies, and more painful\r\nnarrations of excesses, the truth of which he could not disprove. The\r\nresult was, that he would make one more attempt to reclaim him, and in\r\ncase of ill success, cast him off for ever.\r\n\r\nSuch a scene must have been one of deepest interest and high-wrought\r\npassion. A powerful king, conspicuous for a goodness which had\r\nheretofore made him meek, and now lofty in his admonitions, with\r\nalternate entreaty and reproof, besought his friend to attend to his\r\nreal interests, resolutely to avoid those fascinations which in fact\r\nwere fast deserting him, and to spend his great powers on a worthy\r\nfield, in which he, his sovereign, would be his prop, his stay, and his\r\npioneer. My father felt this kindness; for a moment ambitious dreams\r\nfloated before him; and he thought that it would be well to exchange\r\nhis present pursuits for nobler duties. With sincerity and fervour he\r\ngave the required promise: as a pledge of continued favour, he received\r\nfrom his royal master a sum of money to defray pressing debts, and\r\nenable him to enter under good auspices his new career. That very\r\nnight, while yet full of gratitude and good resolves, this whole sum,\r\nand its amount doubled, was lost at the gaming-table. In his desire to\r\nrepair his first losses, my father risked double stakes, and thus\r\nincurred a debt of honour he was wholly unable to pay. Ashamed to apply\r\nagain to the king, he turned his back upon London, its false delights\r\nand clinging miseries; and, with poverty for his sole companion, buried\r\nhimself in solitude among the hills and lakes of Cumberland. His wit,\r\nhis bon mots, the record of his personal attractions, fascinating\r\nmanners, and social talents, were long remembered and repeated from\r\nmouth to mouth. Ask where now was this favourite of fashion, this\r\ncompanion of the noble, this excelling beam, which gilt with alien\r\nsplendour the assemblies of the courtly and the gay\xe2\x80\x94you heard that he\r\nwas under a cloud, a lost man; not one thought it belonged to him to\r\nrepay pleasure by real services, or that his long reign of brilliant\r\nwit deserved a pension on retiring. The king lamented his absence; he\r\nloved to repeat his sayings, relate the adventures they had had\r\ntogether, and exalt his talents\xe2\x80\x94but here ended his reminiscence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my father, forgotten, could not forget. He repined for the\r\nloss of what was more necessary to him than air or food\xe2\x80\x94the excitements\r\nof pleasure, the admiration of the noble, the luxurious and polished\r\nliving of the great. A nervous fever was the consequence; during which\r\nhe was nursed by the daughter of a poor cottager, under whose roof he\r\nlodged. She was lovely, gentle, and, above all, kind to him; nor can it\r\nafford astonishment, that the late idol of high-bred beauty should,\r\neven in a fallen state, appear a being of an elevated and wondrous\r\nnature to the lowly cottage-girl. The attachment between them led to\r\nthe ill-fated marriage, of which I was the offspring. Notwithstanding\r\nthe tenderness and sweetness of my mother, her husband still deplored\r\nhis degraded state. Unaccustomed to industry, he knew not in what way\r\nto contribute to the support of his increasing family. Sometimes he\r\nthought of applying to the king; pride and shame for a while withheld\r\nhim; and, before his necessities became so imperious as to compel him\r\nto some kind of exertion, he died. For one brief interval before this\r\ncatastrophe, he looked forward to the future, and contemplated with\r\nanguish the desolate situation in which his wife and children would be\r\nleft. His last effort was a letter to the king, full of touching\r\neloquence, and of occasional flashes of that brilliant spirit which was\r\nan integral part of him. He bequeathed his widow and orphans to the\r\nfriendship of his royal master, and felt satisfied that, by this means,\r\ntheir prosperity was better assured in his death than in his life. This\r\nletter was enclosed to the care of a nobleman, who, he did not doubt,\r\nwould perform the last and inexpensive office of placing it in the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s own hand.\r\n\r\nHe died in debt, and his little property was seized immediately by his\r\ncreditors. My mother, pennyless and burthened with two children, waited\r\nweek after week, and month after month, in sickening expectation of a\r\nreply, which never came. She had no experience beyond her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncottage; and the mansion of the lord of the manor was the chiefest type\r\nof grandeur she could conceive. During my father\xe2\x80\x99s life, she had been\r\nmade familiar with the name of royalty and the courtly circle; but such\r\nthings, ill according with her personal experience, appeared, after the\r\nloss of him who gave substance and reality to them, vague and\r\nfantastical. If, under any circumstances, she could have acquired\r\nsufficient courage to address the noble persons mentioned by her\r\nhusband, the ill success of his own application caused her to banish\r\nthe idea. She saw therefore no escape from dire penury: perpetual care,\r\njoined to sorrow for the loss of the wondrous being, whom she continued\r\nto contemplate with ardent admiration, hard labour, and naturally\r\ndelicate health, at length released her from the sad continuity of want\r\nand misery.\r\n\r\nThe condition of her orphan children was peculiarly desolate. Her own\r\nfather had been an emigrant from another part of the country, and had\r\ndied long since: they had no one relation to take them by the hand;\r\nthey were outcasts, paupers, unfriended beings, to whom the most scanty\r\npittance was a matter of favour, and who were treated merely as\r\nchildren of peasants, yet poorer than the poorest, who, dying, had left\r\nthem, a thankless bequest, to the close-handed charity of the land.\r\n\r\nI, the elder of the two, was five years old when my mother died. A\r\nremembrance of the discourses of my parents, and the communications\r\nwhich my mother endeavoured to impress upon me concerning my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends, in slight hope that I might one day derive benefit from the\r\nknowledge, floated like an indistinct dream through my brain. I\r\nconceived that I was different and superior to my protectors and\r\ncompanions, but I knew not how or wherefore. The sense of injury,\r\nassociated with the name of king and noble, clung to me; but I could\r\ndraw no conclusions from such feelings, to serve as a guide to action.\r\nMy first real knowledge of myself was as an unprotected orphan among\r\nthe valleys and fells of Cumberland. I was in the service of a farmer;\r\nand with crook in hand, my dog at my side, I shepherded a numerous\r\nflock on the near uplands. I cannot say much in praise of such a life;\r\nand its pains far exceeded its pleasures. There was freedom in it, a\r\ncompanionship with nature, and a reckless loneliness; but these,\r\nromantic as they were, did not accord with the love of action and\r\ndesire of human sympathy, characteristic of youth. Neither the care of\r\nmy flock, nor the change of seasons, were sufficient to tame my eager\r\nspirit; my out-door life and unemployed time were the temptations that\r\nled me early into lawless habits. I associated with others friendless\r\nlike myself; I formed them into a band, I was their chief and captain.\r\nAll shepherd-boys alike, while our flocks were spread over the\r\npastures, we schemed and executed many a mischievous prank, which drew\r\non us the anger and revenge of the rustics. I was the leader and\r\nprotector of my comrades, and as I became distinguished among them,\r\ntheir misdeeds were usually visited upon me. But while I endured\r\npunishment and pain in their defence with the spirit of an hero, I\r\nclaimed as my reward their praise and obedience.\r\n\r\nIn such a school my disposition became rugged, but firm. The appetite\r\nfor admiration and small capacity for self-controul which I inherited\r\nfrom my father, nursed by adversity, made me daring and reckless. I was\r\nrough as the elements, and unlearned as the animals I tended. I often\r\ncompared myself to them, and finding that my chief superiority\r\nconsisted in power, I soon persuaded myself that it was in power only\r\nthat I was inferior to the chiefest potentates of the earth. Thus\r\nuntaught in refined philosophy, and pursued by a restless feeling of\r\ndegradation from my true station in society, I wandered among the hills\r\nof civilized England as uncouth a savage as the wolf-bred founder of\r\nold Rome. I owned but one law, it was that of the strongest, and my\r\ngreatest deed of virtue was never to submit.\r\n\r\nYet let me a little retract from this sentence I have passed on myself.\r\nMy mother, when dying, had, in addition to her other half-forgotten and\r\nmisapplied lessons, committed, with solemn exhortation, her other child\r\nto my fraternal guardianship; and this one duty I performed to the best\r\nof my ability, with all the zeal and affection of which my nature was\r\ncapable. My sister was three years younger than myself; I had nursed\r\nher as an infant, and when the difference of our sexes, by giving us\r\nvarious occupations, in a great measure divided us, yet she continued\r\nto be the object of my careful love. Orphans, in the fullest sense of\r\nthe term, we were poorest among the poor, and despised among the\r\nunhonoured. If my daring and courage obtained for me a kind of\r\nrespectful aversion, her youth and sex, since they did not excite\r\ntenderness, by proving her to be weak, were the causes of numberless\r\nmortifications to her; and her own disposition was not so constituted\r\nas to diminish the evil effects of her lowly station.\r\n\r\nShe was a singular being, and, like me, inherited much of the peculiar\r\ndisposition of our father. Her countenance was all expression; her eyes\r\nwere not dark, but impenetrably deep; you seemed to discover space\r\nafter space in their intellectual glance, and to feel that the soul\r\nwhich was their soul, comprehended an universe of thought in its ken.\r\nShe was pale and fair, and her golden hair clustered on her temples,\r\ncontrasting its rich hue with the living marble beneath. Her coarse\r\npeasant-dress, little consonant apparently with the refinement of\r\nfeeling which her face expressed, yet in a strange manner accorded with\r\nit. She was like one of Guido\xe2\x80\x99s saints, with heaven in her heart and in\r\nher look, so that when you saw her you only thought of that within, and\r\ncostume and even feature were secondary to the mind that beamed in her\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nYet though lovely and full of noble feeling, my poor Perdita (for this\r\nwas the fanciful name my sister had received from her dying parent),\r\nwas not altogether saintly in her disposition. Her manners were cold\r\nand repulsive. If she had been nurtured by those who had regarded her\r\nwith affection, she might have been different; but unloved and\r\nneglected, she repaid want of kindness with distrust and silence. She\r\nwas submissive to those who held authority over her, but a perpetual\r\ncloud dwelt on her brow; she looked as if she expected enmity from\r\nevery one who approached her, and her actions were instigated by the\r\nsame feeling. All the time she could command she spent in solitude. She\r\nwould ramble to the most unfrequented places, and scale dangerous\r\nheights, that in those unvisited spots she might wrap herself in\r\nloneliness. Often she passed whole hours walking up and down the paths\r\nof the woods; she wove garlands of flowers and ivy, or watched the\r\nflickering of the shadows and glancing of the leaves; sometimes she sat\r\nbeside a stream, and as her thoughts paused, threw flowers or pebbles\r\ninto the waters, watching how those swam and these sank; or she would\r\nset afloat boats formed of bark of trees or leaves, with a feather for\r\na sail, and intensely watch the navigation of her craft among the\r\nrapids and shallows of the brook. Meanwhile her active fancy wove a\r\nthousand combinations; she dreamt \xe2\x80\x9cof moving accidents by flood and\r\nfield\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she lost herself delightedly in these self-created wanderings,\r\nand returned with unwilling spirit to the dull detail of common life.\r\nPoverty was the cloud that veiled her excellencies, and all that was\r\ngood in her seemed about to perish from want of the genial dew of\r\naffection. She had not even the same advantage as I in the recollection\r\nof her parents; she clung to me, her brother, as her only friend, but\r\nher alliance with me completed the distaste that her protectors felt\r\nfor her; and every error was magnified by them into crimes. If she had\r\nbeen bred in that sphere of life to which by inheritance the delicate\r\nframework of her mind and person was adapted, she would have been the\r\nobject almost of adoration, for her virtues were as eminent as her\r\ndefects. All the genius that ennobled the blood of her father\r\nillustrated hers; a generous tide flowed in her veins; artifice, envy,\r\nor meanness, were at the antipodes of her nature; her countenance, when\r\nenlightened by amiable feeling, might have belonged to a queen of\r\nnations; her eyes were bright; her look fearless.\r\n\r\nAlthough by our situation and dispositions we were almost equally cut\r\noff from the usual forms of social intercourse, we formed a strong\r\ncontrast to each other. I always required the stimulants of\r\ncompanionship and applause. Perdita was all-sufficient to herself.\r\nNotwithstanding my lawless habits, my disposition was sociable, hers\r\nrecluse. My life was spent among tangible realities, hers was a dream.\r\nI might be said even to love my enemies, since by exciting me they in a\r\nsort bestowed happiness upon me; Perdita almost disliked her friends,\r\nfor they interfered with her visionary moods. All my feelings, even of\r\nexultation and triumph, were changed to bitterness, if unparticipated;\r\nPerdita, even in joy, fled to loneliness, and could go on from day to\r\nday, neither expressing her emotions, nor seeking a fellow-feeling in\r\nanother mind. Nay, she could love and dwell with tenderness on the look\r\nand voice of her friend, while her demeanour expressed the coldest\r\nreserve. A sensation with her became a sentiment, and she never spoke\r\nuntil she had mingled her perceptions of outward objects with others\r\nwhich were the native growth of her own mind. She was like a fruitful\r\nsoil that imbibed the airs and dews of heaven, and gave them forth\r\nagain to light in loveliest forms of fruits and flowers; but then she\r\nwas often dark and rugged as that soil, raked up, and new sown with\r\nunseen seed.\r\n\r\nShe dwelt in a cottage whose trim grass-plat sloped down to the waters\r\nof the lake of Ulswater; a beech wood stretched up the hill behind, and\r\na purling brook gently falling from the acclivity ran through\r\npoplar-shaded banks into the lake. I lived with a farmer whose house\r\nwas built higher up among the hills: a dark crag rose behind it, and,\r\nexposed to the north, the snow lay in its crevices the summer through.\r\nBefore dawn I led my flock to the sheep-walks, and guarded them through\r\nthe day. It was a life of toil; for rain and cold were more frequent\r\nthan sunshine; but it was my pride to contemn the elements. My trusty\r\ndog watched the sheep as I slipped away to the rendezvous of my\r\ncomrades, and thence to the accomplishment of our schemes. At noon we\r\nmet again, and we threw away in contempt our peasant fare, as we built\r\nour fire-place and kindled the cheering blaze destined to cook the game\r\nstolen from the neighbouring preserves. Then came the tale of\r\nhair-breadth escapes, combats with dogs, ambush and flight, as\r\ngipsey-like we encompassed our pot. The search after a stray lamb, or\r\nthe devices by which we elude or endeavoured to elude punishment,\r\nfilled up the hours of afternoon; in the evening my flock went to its\r\nfold, and I to my sister.\r\n\r\nIt was seldom indeed that we escaped, to use an old-fashioned phrase,\r\nscot free. Our dainty fare was often exchanged for blows and\r\nimprisonment. Once, when thirteen years of age, I was sent for a month\r\nto the county jail. I came out, my morals unimproved, my hatred to my\r\noppressors encreased tenfold. Bread and water did not tame my blood,\r\nnor solitary confinement inspire me with gentle thoughts. I was angry,\r\nimpatient, miserable; my only happy hours were those during which I\r\ndevised schemes of revenge; these were perfected in my forced solitude,\r\nso that during the whole of the following season, and I was freed early\r\nin September, I never failed to provide excellent and plenteous fare\r\nfor myself and my comrades. This was a glorious winter. The sharp frost\r\nand heavy snows tamed the animals, and kept the country gentlemen by\r\ntheir firesides; we got more game than we could eat, and my faithful\r\ndog grew sleek upon our refuse.\r\n\r\nThus years passed on; and years only added fresh love of freedom, and\r\ncontempt for all that was not as wild and rude as myself. At the age of\r\nsixteen I had shot up in appearance to man\xe2\x80\x99s estate; I was tall and\r\nathletic; I was practised to feats of strength, and inured to the\r\ninclemency of the elements. My skin was embrowned by the sun; my step\r\nwas firm with conscious power. I feared no man, and loved none. In\r\nafter life I looked back with wonder to what I then was; how utterly\r\nworthless I should have become if I had pursued my lawless career. My\r\nlife was like that of an animal, and my mind was in danger of\r\ndegenerating into that which informs brute nature. Until now, my savage\r\nhabits had done me no radical mischief; my physical powers had grown up\r\nand flourished under their influence, and my mind, undergoing the same\r\ndiscipline, was imbued with all the hardy virtues. But now my boasted\r\nindependence was daily instigating me to acts of tyranny, and freedom\r\nwas becoming licentiousness. I stood on the brink of manhood; passions,\r\nstrong as the trees of a forest, had already taken root within me, and\r\nwere about to shadow with their noxious overgrowth, my path of life.\r\n\r\nI panted for enterprises beyond my childish exploits, and formed\r\ndistempered dreams of future action. I avoided my ancient comrades, and\r\nI soon lost them. They arrived at the age when they were sent to fulfil\r\ntheir destined situations in life; while I, an outcast, with none to\r\nlead or drive me forward, paused. The old began to point at me as an\r\nexample, the young to wonder at me as a being distinct from themselves;\r\nI hated them, and began, last and worst degradation, to hate myself. I\r\nclung to my ferocious habits, yet half despised them; I continued my\r\nwar against civilization, and yet entertained a wish to belong to it.\r\n\r\nI revolved again and again all that I remembered my mother to have told\r\nme of my father\xe2\x80\x99s former life; I contemplated the few relics I\r\npossessed belonging to him, which spoke of greater refinement than\r\ncould be found among the mountain cottages; but nothing in all this\r\nserved as a guide to lead me to another and pleasanter way of life. My\r\nfather had been connected with nobles, but all I knew of such\r\nconnection was subsequent neglect. The name of the king,\xe2\x80\x94he to whom my\r\ndying father had addressed his latest prayers, and who had barbarously\r\nslighted them, was associated only with the ideas of unkindness,\r\ninjustice, and consequent resentment. I was born for something greater\r\nthan I was\xe2\x80\x94and greater I would become; but greatness, at least to my\r\ndistorted perceptions, was no necessary associate of goodness, and my\r\nwild thoughts were unchecked by moral considerations when they rioted\r\nin dreams of distinction. Thus I stood upon a pinnacle, a sea of evil\r\nrolled at my feet; I was about to precipitate myself into it, and rush\r\nlike a torrent over all obstructions to the object of my wishes\xe2\x80\x94 when a\r\nstranger influence came over the current of my fortunes, and changed\r\ntheir boisterous course to what was in comparison like the gentle\r\nmeanderings of a meadow-encircling streamlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nI lived far from the busy haunts of men, and the rumour of wars or\r\npolitical changes came worn to a mere sound, to our mountain abodes.\r\nEngland had been the scene of momentous struggles, during my early\r\nboyhood. In the year 2073, the last of its kings, the ancient friend of\r\nmy father, had abdicated in compliance with the gentle force of the\r\nremonstrances of his subjects, and a republic was instituted. Large\r\nestates were secured to the dethroned monarch and his family; he\r\nreceived the title of Earl of Windsor, and Windsor Castle, an ancient\r\nroyalty, with its wide demesnes were a part of his allotted wealth. He\r\ndied soon after, leaving two children, a son and a daughter.\r\n\r\nThe ex-queen, a princess of the house of Austria, had long impelled her\r\nhusband to withstand the necessity of the times. She was haughty and\r\nfearless; she cherished a love of power, and a bitter contempt for him\r\nwho had despoiled himself of a kingdom. For her children\xe2\x80\x99s sake alone\r\nshe consented to remain, shorn of regality, a member of the English\r\nrepublic. When she became a widow, she turned all her thoughts to the\r\neducating her son Adrian, second Earl of Windsor, so as to accomplish\r\nher ambitious ends; and with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s milk he imbibed, and was\r\nintended to grow up in the steady purpose of re-acquiring his lost\r\ncrown. Adrian was now fifteen years of age. He was addicted to study,\r\nand imbued beyond his years with learning and talent: report said that\r\nhe had already begun to thwart his mother\xe2\x80\x99s views, and to entertain\r\nrepublican principles. However this might be, the haughty Countess\r\nentrusted none with the secrets of her family-tuition. Adrian was bred\r\nup in solitude, and kept apart from the natural companions of his age\r\nand rank. Some unknown circumstance now induced his mother to send him\r\nfrom under her immediate tutelage; and we heard that he was about to\r\nvisit Cumberland. A thousand tales were rife, explanatory of the\r\nCountess of Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s conduct; none true probably; but each day it\r\nbecame more certain that we should have the noble scion of the late\r\nregal house of England among us.\r\n\r\nThere was a large estate with a mansion attached to it, belonging to\r\nthis family, at Ulswater. A large park was one of its appendages, laid\r\nout with great taste, and plentifully stocked with game. I had often\r\nmade depredations on these preserves; and the neglected state of the\r\nproperty facilitated my incursions. When it was decided that the young\r\nEarl of Windsor should visit Cumberland, workmen arrived to put the\r\nhouse and grounds in order for his reception. The apartments were\r\nrestored to their pristine splendour, and the park, all disrepairs\r\nrestored, was guarded with unusual care.\r\n\r\nI was beyond measure disturbed by this intelligence. It roused all my\r\ndormant recollections, my suspended sentiments of injury, and gave rise\r\nto the new one of revenge. I could no longer attend to my occupations;\r\nall my plans and devices were forgotten; I seemed about to begin life\r\nanew, and that under no good auspices. The tug of war, I thought, was\r\nnow to begin. He would come triumphantly to the district to which my\r\nparent had fled broken-hearted; he would find the ill-fated offspring,\r\nbequeathed with such vain confidence to his royal father, miserable\r\npaupers. That he should know of our existence, and treat us, near at\r\nhand, with the same contumely which his father had practised in\r\ndistance and absence, appeared to me the certain consequence of all\r\nthat had gone before. Thus then I should meet this titled stripling\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nson of my father\xe2\x80\x99s friend. He would be hedged in by servants; nobles,\r\nand the sons of nobles, were his companions; all England rang with his\r\nname; and his coming, like a thunderstorm, was heard from far: while I,\r\nunlettered and unfashioned, should, if I came in contact with him, in\r\nthe judgment of his courtly followers, bear evidence in my very person\r\nto the propriety of that ingratitude which had made me the degraded\r\nbeing I appeared.\r\n\r\nWith my mind fully occupied by these ideas, I might be said as if\r\nfascinated, to haunt the destined abode of the young Earl. I watched\r\nthe progress of the improvements, and stood by the unlading waggons, as\r\nvarious articles of luxury, brought from London, were taken forth and\r\nconveyed into the mansion. It was part of the Ex-Queen\xe2\x80\x99s plan, to\r\nsurround her son with princely magnificence. I beheld rich carpets and\r\nsilken hangings, ornaments of gold, richly embossed metals, emblazoned\r\nfurniture, and all the appendages of high rank arranged, so that\r\nnothing but what was regal in splendour should reach the eye of one of\r\nroyal descent. I looked on these; I turned my gaze to my own mean\r\ndress.\xe2\x80\x94Whence sprung this difference? Whence but from ingratitude, from\r\nfalsehood, from a dereliction on the part of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s father, of\r\nall noble sympathy and generous feeling. Doubtless, he also, whose\r\nblood received a mingling tide from his proud mother\xe2\x80\x94he, the\r\nacknowledged focus of the kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s wealth and nobility, had been\r\ntaught to repeat my father\xe2\x80\x99s name with disdain, and to scoff at my just\r\nclaims to protection. I strove to think that all this grandeur was but\r\nmore glaring infamy, and that, by planting his gold-enwoven flag beside\r\nmy tarnished and tattered banner, he proclaimed not his superiority,\r\nbut his debasement. Yet I envied him. His stud of beautiful horses, his\r\narms of costly workmanship, the praise that attended him, the\r\nadoration, ready servitor, high place and high esteem,\xe2\x80\x94I considered\r\nthem as forcibly wrenched from me, and envied them all with novel and\r\ntormenting bitterness.\r\n\r\nTo crown my vexation of spirit, Perdita, the visionary Perdita, seemed\r\nto awake to real life with transport, when she told me that the Earl of\r\nWindsor was about to arrive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this pleases you?\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, moodily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed it does, Lionel,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI quite long to see him; he is\r\nthe descendant of our kings, the first noble of the land: every one\r\nadmires and loves him, and they say that his rank is his least merit;\r\nhe is generous, brave, and affable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have learnt a pretty lesson, Perdita,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand repeat it so\r\nliterally, that you forget the while the proofs we have of the Earl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvirtues; his generosity to us is manifest in our plenty, his bravery in\r\nthe protection he affords us, his affability in the notice he takes of\r\nus. His rank his least merit, do you say? Why, all his virtues are\r\nderived from his station only; because he is rich, he is called\r\ngenerous; because he is powerful, brave; because he is well served, he\r\nis affable. Let them call him so, let all England believe him to be\r\nthus\xe2\x80\x94we know him\xe2\x80\x94he is our enemy\xe2\x80\x94our penurious, dastardly, arrogant\r\nenemy; if he were gifted with one particle of the virtues you call his,\r\nhe would do justly by us, if it were only to shew, that if he must\r\nstrike, it should not be a fallen foe. His father injured my father\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nfather, unassailable on his throne, dared despise him who only stooped\r\nbeneath himself, when he deigned to associate with the royal ingrate.\r\nWe, descendants from the one and the other, must be enemies also. He\r\nshall find that I can feel my injuries; he shall learn to dread my\r\nrevenge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few days after he arrived. Every inhabitant of the most miserable\r\ncottage, went to swell the stream of population that poured forth to\r\nmeet him: even Perdita, in spite of my late philippic, crept near the\r\nhighway, to behold this idol of all hearts. I, driven half mad, as I\r\nmet party after party of the country people, in their holiday best,\r\ndescending the hills, escaped to their cloud-veiled summits, and\r\nlooking on the sterile rocks about me, exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_They_ do not cry,\r\nlong live the Earl!\xe2\x80\x9d Nor, when night came, accompanied by drizzling\r\nrain and cold, would I return home; for I knew that each cottage rang\r\nwith the praises of Adrian; as I felt my limbs grow numb and chill, my\r\npain served as food for my insane aversion; nay, I almost triumphed in\r\nit, since it seemed to afford me reason and excuse for my hatred of my\r\nunheeding adversary. All was attributed to him, for I confounded so\r\nentirely the idea of father and son, that I forgot that the latter\r\nmight be wholly unconscious of his parent\xe2\x80\x99s neglect of us; and as I\r\nstruck my aching head with my hand, I cried: \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall hear of this! I\r\nwill be revenged! I will not suffer like a spaniel! He shall know,\r\nbeggar and friendless as I am, that I will not tamely submit to\r\ninjury!\xe2\x80\x9d Each day, each hour added to these exaggerated wrongs. His\r\npraises were so many adder\xe2\x80\x99s stings infixed in my vulnerable breast. If\r\nI saw him at a distance, riding a beautiful horse, my blood boiled with\r\nrage; the air seemed poisoned by his presence, and my very native\r\nEnglish was changed to a vile jargon, since every phrase I heard was\r\ncoupled with his name and honour. I panted to relieve this painful\r\nheart-burning by some misdeed that should rouse him to a sense of my\r\nantipathy. It was the height of his offending, that he should occasion\r\nin me such intolerable sensations, and not deign himself to afford any\r\ndemonstration that he was aware that I even lived to feel them.\r\n\r\nIt soon became known that Adrian took great delight in his park and\r\npreserves. He never sported, but spent hours in watching the tribes of\r\nlovely and almost tame animals with which it was stocked, and ordered\r\nthat greater care should be taken of them than ever. Here was an\r\nopening for my plans of offence, and I made use of it with all the\r\nbrute impetuosity I derived from my active mode of life. I proposed the\r\nenterprize of poaching on his demesne to my few remaining comrades, who\r\nwere the most determined and lawless of the crew; but they all shrunk\r\nfrom the peril; so I was left to achieve my revenge myself. At first my\r\nexploits were unperceived; I increased in daring; footsteps on the dewy\r\ngrass, torn boughs, and marks of slaughter, at length betrayed me to\r\nthe game-keepers. They kept better watch; I was taken, and sent to\r\nprison. I entered its gloomy walls in a fit of triumphant extasy: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nfeels me now,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand shall, again and again!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I passed but one\r\nday in confinement; in the evening I was liberated, as I was told, by\r\nthe order of the Earl himself. This news precipitated me from my\r\nself-raised pinnacle of honour. He despises me, I thought; but he shall\r\nlearn that I despise him, and hold in equal contempt his punishments\r\nand his clemency. On the second night after my release, I was again\r\ntaken by the gamekeepers\xe2\x80\x94again imprisoned, and again released; and\r\nagain, such was my pertinacity, did the fourth night find me in the\r\nforbidden park. The gamekeepers were more enraged than their lord by my\r\nobstinacy. They had received orders that if I were again taken, I\r\nshould be brought to the Earl; and his lenity made them expect a\r\nconclusion which they considered ill befitting my crime. One of them,\r\nwho had been from the first the leader among those who had seized me,\r\nresolved to satisfy his own resentment, before he made me over to the\r\nhigher powers.\r\n\r\nThe late setting of the moon, and the extreme caution I was obliged to\r\nuse in this my third expedition, consumed so much time, that something\r\nlike a qualm of fear came over me when I perceived dark night yield to\r\ntwilight. I crept along by the fern, on my hands and knees, seeking the\r\nshadowy coverts of the underwood, while the birds awoke with unwelcome\r\nsong above, and the fresh morning wind, playing among the boughs, made\r\nme suspect a footfall at each turn. My heart beat quick as I approached\r\nthe palings; my hand was on one of them, a leap would take me to the\r\nother side, when two keepers sprang from an ambush upon me: one knocked\r\nme down, and proceeded to inflict a severe horse-whipping. I started\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94a knife was in my grasp; I made a plunge at his raised right arm,\r\nand inflicted a deep, wide wound in his hand. The rage and yells of the\r\nwounded man, the howling execrations of his comrade, which I answered\r\nwith equal bitterness and fury, echoed through the dell; morning broke\r\nmore and more, ill accordant in its celestial beauty with our brute and\r\nnoisy contest. I and my enemy were still struggling, when the wounded\r\nman exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Earl!\xe2\x80\x9d I sprang out of the herculean hold of the\r\nkeeper, panting from my exertions; I cast furious glances on my\r\npersecutors, and placing myself with my back to a tree, resolved to\r\ndefend myself to the last. My garments were torn, and they, as well as\r\nmy hands, were stained with the blood of the man I had wounded; one\r\nhand grasped the dead birds\xe2\x80\x94my hard-earned prey, the other held the\r\nknife; my hair was matted; my face besmeared with the same guilty signs\r\nthat bore witness against me on the dripping instrument I clenched; my\r\nwhole appearance was haggard and squalid. Tall and muscular as I was in\r\nform, I must have looked like, what indeed I was, the merest ruffian\r\nthat ever trod the earth.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Earl startled me, and caused all the indignant blood\r\nthat warmed my heart to rush into my cheeks; I had never seen him\r\nbefore; I figured to myself a haughty, assuming youth, who would take\r\nme to task, if he deigned to speak to me, with all the arrogance of\r\nsuperiority. My reply was ready; a reproach I deemed calculated to\r\nsting his very heart. He came up the while; and his appearance blew\r\naside, with gentle western breath, my cloudy wrath: a tall, slim, fair\r\nboy, with a physiognomy expressive of the excess of sensibility and\r\nrefinement stood before me; the morning sunbeams tinged with gold his\r\nsilken hair, and spread light and glory over his beaming countenance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. The men eagerly began their defence; he put\r\nthem aside, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo of you at once on a mere lad\xe2\x80\x94 for shame!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ncame up to me: \xe2\x80\x9cVerney,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cLionel Verney, do we meet thus for\r\nthe first time? We were born to be friends to each other; and though\r\nill fortune has divided us, will you not acknowledge the hereditary\r\nbond of friendship which I trust will hereafter unite us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, his earnest eyes, fixed on me, seemed to read my very\r\nsoul: my heart, my savage revengeful heart, felt the influence of sweet\r\nbenignity sink upon it; while his thrilling voice, like sweetest\r\nmelody, awoke a mute echo within me, stirring to its depths the\r\nlife-blood in my frame. I desired to reply, to acknowledge his\r\ngoodness, accept his proffered friendship; but words, fitting words,\r\nwere not afforded to the rough mountaineer; I would have held out my\r\nhand, but its guilty stain restrained me. Adrian took pity on my\r\nfaltering mien: \xe2\x80\x9cCome with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have much to say to you;\r\ncome home with me\xe2\x80\x94you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe that I now know you, and that you\r\nwill pardon my mistakes\xe2\x80\x94my crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdrian smiled gently; and after giving his orders to the gamekeepers,\r\nhe came up to me; putting his arm in mine, we walked together to the\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nIt was not his rank\xe2\x80\x94after all that I have said, surely it will not be\r\nsuspected that it was Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s rank, that, from the first, subdued my\r\nheart of hearts, and laid my entire spirit prostrate before him. Nor\r\nwas it I alone who felt thus intimately his perfections. His\r\nsensibility and courtesy fascinated every one. His vivacity,\r\nintelligence, and active spirit of benevolence, completed the conquest.\r\nEven at this early age, he was deep read and imbued with the spirit of\r\nhigh philosophy. This spirit gave a tone of irresistible persuasion to\r\nhis intercourse with others, so that he seemed like an inspired\r\nmusician, who struck, with unerring skill, the \xe2\x80\x9clyre of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nproduced thence divine harmony. In person, he hardly appeared of this\r\nworld; his slight frame was overinformed by the soul that dwelt within;\r\nhe was all mind; \xe2\x80\x9cMan but a rush against\xe2\x80\x9d his breast, and it would have\r\nconquered his strength; but the might of his smile would have tamed an\r\nhungry lion, or caused a legion of armed men to lay their weapons at\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nI spent the day with him. At first he did not recur to the past, or\r\nindeed to any personal occurrences. He wished probably to inspire me\r\nwith confidence, and give me time to gather together my scattered\r\nthoughts. He talked of general subjects, and gave me ideas I had never\r\nbefore conceived. We sat in his library, and he spoke of the old Greek\r\nsages, and of the power which they had acquired over the minds of men,\r\nthrough the force of love and wisdom only. The room was decorated with\r\nthe busts of many of them, and he described their characters to me. As\r\nhe spoke, I felt subject to him; and all my boasted pride and strength\r\nwere subdued by the honeyed accents of this blue-eyed boy. The trim and\r\npaled demesne of civilization, which I had before regarded from my wild\r\njungle as inaccessible, had its wicket opened by him; I stepped within,\r\nand felt, as I entered, that I trod my native soil.\r\n\r\nAs evening came on, he reverted to the past. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a tale to relate,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cand much explanation to give concerning the past; perhaps you\r\ncan assist me to curtail it. Do you remember your father? I had never\r\nthe happiness of seeing him, but his name is one of my earliest\r\nrecollections: he stands written in my mind\xe2\x80\x99s tablets as the type of\r\nall that was gallant, amiable, and fascinating in man. His wit was not\r\nmore conspicuous than the overflowing goodness of his heart, which he\r\npoured in such full measure on his friends, as to leave, alas! small\r\nremnant for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this encomium, I proceeded, in answer to his inquiries,\r\nto relate what I remembered of my parent; and he gave an account of\r\nthose circumstances which had brought about a neglect of my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntestamentary letter. When, in after times, Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s father, then king\r\nof England, felt his situation become more perilous, his line of\r\nconduct more embarrassed, again and again he wished for his early\r\nfriend, who might stand a mound against the impetuous anger of his\r\nqueen, a mediator between him and the parliament. From the time that he\r\nhad quitted London, on the fatal night of his defeat at the\r\ngaming-table, the king had received no tidings concerning him; and\r\nwhen, after the lapse of years, he exerted himself to discover him,\r\nevery trace was lost. With fonder regret than ever, he clung to his\r\nmemory; and gave it in charge to his son, if ever he should meet this\r\nvalued friend, in his name to bestow every succour, and to assure him\r\nthat, to the last, his attachment survived separation and silence.\r\n\r\nA short time before Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Cumberland, the heir of the\r\nnobleman to whom my father had confided his last appeal to his royal\r\nmaster, put this letter, its seal unbroken, into the young Earl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. It had been found cast aside with a mass of papers of old date,\r\nand accident alone brought it to light. Adrian read it with deep\r\ninterest; and found there that living spirit of genius and wit he had\r\nso often heard commemorated. He discovered the name of the spot whither\r\nmy father had retreated, and where he died; he learnt the existence of\r\nhis orphan children; and during the short interval between his arrival\r\nat Ulswater and our meeting in the park, he had been occupied in making\r\ninquiries concerning us, and arranging a variety of plans for our\r\nbenefit, preliminary to his introducing himself to our notice.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which he spoke of my father was gratifying to my vanity;\r\nthe veil which he delicately cast over his benevolence, in alledging a\r\nduteous fulfilment of the king\xe2\x80\x99s latest will, was soothing to my pride.\r\nOther feelings, less ambiguous, were called into play by his\r\nconciliating manner and the generous warmth of his expressions, respect\r\nrarely before experienced, admiration, and love\xe2\x80\x94he had touched my rocky\r\nheart with his magic power, and the stream of affection gushed forth,\r\nimperishable and pure. In the evening we parted; he pressed my hand:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall meet again; come to me to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d I clasped that kind hand;\r\nI tried to answer; a fervent \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d was all my ignorance\r\ncould frame of speech, and I darted away, oppressed by my new emotions.\r\n\r\nI could not rest. I sought the hills; a west wind swept them, and the\r\nstars glittered above. I ran on, careless of outward objects, but\r\ntrying to master the struggling spirit within me by means of bodily\r\nfatigue. \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cis power! Not to be strong of limb, hard\r\nof heart, ferocious, and daring; but kind, compassionate and\r\nsoft.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Stopping short, I clasped my hands, and with the fervour of a\r\nnew proselyte, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cDoubt me not, Adrian, I also will become wise\r\nand good!\xe2\x80\x9d and then quite overcome, I wept aloud.\r\n\r\nAs this gust of passion passed from me, I felt more composed. I lay on\r\nthe ground, and giving the reins to my thoughts, repassed in my mind my\r\nformer life; and began, fold by fold, to unwind the many errors of my\r\nheart, and to discover how brutish, savage, and worthless I had\r\nhitherto been. I could not however at that time feel remorse, for\r\nmethought I was born anew; my soul threw off the burthen of past sin,\r\nto commence a new career in innocence and love. Nothing harsh or rough\r\nremained to jar with the soft feelings which the transactions of the\r\nday had inspired; I was as a child lisping its devotions after its\r\nmother, and my plastic soul was remoulded by a master hand, which I\r\nneither desired nor was able to resist.\r\n\r\nThis was the first commencement of my friendship with Adrian, and I\r\nmust commemorate this day as the most fortunate of my life. I now began\r\nto be human. I was admitted within that sacred boundary which divides\r\nthe intellectual and moral nature of man from that which characterizes\r\nanimals. My best feelings were called into play to give fitting\r\nresponses to the generosity, wisdom, and amenity of my new friend. He,\r\nwith a noble goodness all his own, took infinite delight in bestowing\r\nto prodigality the treasures of his mind and fortune on the\r\nlong-neglected son of his father\xe2\x80\x99s friend, the offspring of that gifted\r\nbeing whose excellencies and talents he had heard commemorated from\r\ninfancy.\r\n\r\nAfter his abdication the late king had retreated from the sphere of\r\npolitics, yet his domestic circle afforded him small content. The\r\nex-queen had none of the virtues of domestic life, and those of courage\r\nand daring which she possessed were rendered null by the secession of\r\nher husband: she despised him, and did not care to conceal her\r\nsentiments. The king had, in compliance with her exactions, cast off\r\nhis old friends, but he had acquired no new ones under her guidance. In\r\nthis dearth of sympathy, he had recourse to his almost infant son; and\r\nthe early development of talent and sensibility rendered Adrian no\r\nunfitting depository of his father\xe2\x80\x99s confidence. He was never weary of\r\nlistening to the latter\xe2\x80\x99s often repeated accounts of old times, in\r\nwhich my father had played a distinguished part; his keen remarks were\r\nrepeated to the boy, and remembered by him; his wit, his fascinations,\r\nhis very faults were hallowed by the regret of affection; his loss was\r\nsincerely deplored. Even the queen\xe2\x80\x99s dislike of the favourite was\r\nineffectual to deprive him of his son\xe2\x80\x99s admiration: it was bitter,\r\nsarcastic, contemptuous\xe2\x80\x94but as she bestowed her heavy censure alike on\r\nhis virtues as his errors, on his devoted friendship and his\r\nill-bestowed loves, on his disinterestedness and his prodigality, on\r\nhis pre-possessing grace of manner, and the facility with which he\r\nyielded to temptation, her double shot proved too heavy, and fell short\r\nof the mark. Nor did her angry dislike prevent Adrian from imaging my\r\nfather, as he had said, the type of all that was gallant, amiable, and\r\nfascinating in man. It was not strange therefore, that when he heard of\r\nthe existence of the offspring of this celebrated person, he should\r\nhave formed the plan of bestowing on them all the advantages his rank\r\nmade him rich to afford. When he found me a vagabond shepherd of the\r\nhills, a poacher, an unlettered savage, still his kindness did not\r\nfail. In addition to the opinion he entertained that his father was to\r\na degree culpable of neglect towards us, and that he was bound to every\r\npossible reparation, he was pleased to say that under all my ruggedness\r\nthere glimmered forth an elevation of spirit, which could be\r\ndistinguished from mere animal courage, and that I inherited a\r\nsimilarity of countenance to my father, which gave proof that all his\r\nvirtues and talents had not died with him. Whatever those might be\r\nwhich descended to me, my noble young friend resolved should not be\r\nlost for want of culture.\r\n\r\nActing upon this plan in our subsequent intercourse, he led me to wish\r\nto participate in that cultivation which graced his own intellect. My\r\nactive mind, when once it seized upon this new idea, fastened on it\r\nwith extreme avidity. At first it was the great object of my ambition\r\nto rival the merits of my father, and render myself worthy of the\r\nfriendship of Adrian. But curiosity soon awoke, and an earnest love of\r\nknowledge, which caused me to pass days and nights in reading and\r\nstudy. I was already well acquainted with what I may term the panorama\r\nof nature, the change of seasons, and the various appearances of heaven\r\nand earth. But I was at once startled and enchanted by my sudden\r\nextension of vision, when the curtain, which had been drawn before the\r\nintellectual world, was withdrawn, and I saw the universe, not only as\r\nit presented itself to my outward senses, but as it had appeared to the\r\nwisest among men. Poetry and its creations, philosophy and its\r\nresearches and classifications, alike awoke the sleeping ideas in my\r\nmind, and gave me new ones.\r\n\r\nI felt as the sailor, who from the topmast first discovered the shore\r\nof America; and like him I hastened to tell my companions of my\r\ndiscoveries in unknown regions. But I was unable to excite in any\r\nbreast the same craving appetite for knowledge that existed in mine.\r\nEven Perdita was unable to understand me. I had lived in what is\r\ngenerally called the world of reality, and it was awakening to a new\r\ncountry to find that there was a deeper meaning in all I saw, besides\r\nthat which my eyes conveyed to me. The visionary Perdita beheld in all\r\nthis only a new gloss upon an old reading, and her own was sufficiently\r\ninexhaustible to content her. She listened to me as she had done to the\r\nnarration of my adventures, and sometimes took an interest in this\r\nspecies of information; but she did not, as I did, look on it as an\r\nintegral part of her being, which having obtained, I could no more put\r\noff than the universal sense of touch.\r\n\r\nWe both agreed in loving Adrian: although she not having yet escaped\r\nfrom childhood could not appreciate as I did the extent of his merits,\r\nor feel the same sympathy in his pursuits and opinions. I was for ever\r\nwith him. There was a sensibility and sweetness in his disposition,\r\nthat gave a tender and unearthly tone to our converse. Then he was gay\r\nas a lark carolling from its skiey tower, soaring in thought as an\r\neagle, innocent as the mild-eyed dove. He could dispel the seriousness\r\nof Perdita, and take the sting from the torturing activity of my\r\nnature. I looked back to my restless desires and painful struggles with\r\nmy fellow beings as to a troubled dream, and felt myself as much\r\nchanged as if I had transmigrated into another form, whose fresh\r\nsensorium and mechanism of nerves had altered the reflection of the\r\napparent universe in the mirror of mind. But it was not so; I was the\r\nsame in strength, in earnest craving for sympathy, in my yearning for\r\nactive exertion. My manly virtues did not desert me, for the witch\r\nUrania spared the locks of Sampson, while he reposed at her feet; but\r\nall was softened and humanized. Nor did Adrian instruct me only in the\r\ncold truths of history and philosophy. At the same time that he taught\r\nme by their means to subdue my own reckless and uncultured spirit, he\r\nopened to my view the living page of his own heart, and gave me to feel\r\nand understand its wondrous character.\r\n\r\nThe ex-queen of England had, even during infancy, endeavoured to\r\nimplant daring and ambitious designs in the mind of her son. She saw\r\nthat he was endowed with genius and surpassing talent; these she\r\ncultivated for the sake of afterwards using them for the furtherance of\r\nher own views. She encouraged his craving for knowledge and his\r\nimpetuous courage; she even tolerated his tameless love of freedom,\r\nunder the hope that this would, as is too often the case, lead to a\r\npassion for command. She endeavoured to bring him up in a sense of\r\nresentment towards, and a desire to revenge himself upon, those who had\r\nbeen instrumental in bringing about his father\xe2\x80\x99s abdication. In this\r\nshe did not succeed. The accounts furnished him, however distorted, of\r\na great and wise nation asserting its right to govern itself, excited\r\nhis admiration: in early days he became a republican from principle.\r\nStill his mother did not despair. To the love of rule and haughty pride\r\nof birth she added determined ambition, patience, and self-control. She\r\ndevoted herself to the study of her son\xe2\x80\x99s disposition. By the\r\napplication of praise, censure, and exhortation, she tried to seek and\r\nstrike the fitting chords; and though the melody that followed her\r\ntouch seemed discord to her, she built her hopes on his talents, and\r\nfelt sure that she would at last win him. The kind of banishment he now\r\nexperienced arose from other causes.\r\n\r\nThe ex-queen had also a daughter, now twelve years of age; his fairy\r\nsister, Adrian was wont to call her; a lovely, animated, little thing,\r\nall sensibility and truth. With these, her children, the noble widow\r\nconstantly resided at Windsor; and admitted no visitors, except her own\r\npartizans, travellers from her native Germany, and a few of the foreign\r\nministers. Among these, and highly distinguished by her, was Prince\r\nZaimi, ambassador to England from the free States of Greece; and his\r\ndaughter, the young Princess Evadne, passed much of her time at Windsor\r\nCastle. In company with this sprightly and clever Greek girl, the\r\nCountess would relax from her usual state. Her views with regard to her\r\nown children, placed all her words and actions relative to _them_ under\r\nrestraint: but Evadne was a plaything she could in no way fear; nor\r\nwere her talents and vivacity slight alleviations to the monotony of\r\nthe Countess\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nEvadne was eighteen years of age. Although they spent much time\r\ntogether at Windsor, the extreme youth of Adrian prevented any\r\nsuspicion as to the nature of their intercourse. But he was ardent and\r\ntender of heart beyond the common nature of man, and had already learnt\r\nto love, while the beauteous Greek smiled benignantly on the boy. It\r\nwas strange to me, who, though older than Adrian, had never loved, to\r\nwitness the whole heart\xe2\x80\x99s sacrifice of my friend. There was neither\r\njealousy, inquietude, or mistrust in his sentiment; it was devotion and\r\nfaith. His life was swallowed up in the existence of his beloved; and\r\nhis heart beat only in unison with the pulsations that vivified hers.\r\nThis was the secret law of his life\xe2\x80\x94he loved and was beloved. The\r\nuniverse was to him a dwelling, to inhabit with his chosen one; and not\r\neither a scheme of society or an enchainment of events, that could\r\nimpart to him either happiness or misery. What, though life and the\r\nsystem of social intercourse were a wilderness, a tiger-haunted jungle!\r\nThrough the midst of its errors, in the depths of its savage recesses,\r\nthere was a disentangled and flowery pathway, through which they might\r\njourney in safety and delight. Their track would be like the passage of\r\nthe Red Sea, which they might traverse with unwet feet, though a wall\r\nof destruction were impending on either side.\r\n\r\nAlas! why must I record the hapless delusion of this matchless specimen\r\nof humanity? What is there in our nature that is for ever urging us on\r\ntowards pain and misery? We are not formed for enjoyment; and, however\r\nwe may be attuned to the reception of pleasureable emotion,\r\ndisappointment is the never-failing pilot of our life\xe2\x80\x99s bark, and\r\nruthlessly carries us on to the shoals. Who was better framed than this\r\nhighly-gifted youth to love and be beloved, and to reap unalienable joy\r\nfrom an unblamed passion? If his heart had slept but a few years\r\nlonger, he might have been saved; but it awoke in its infancy; it had\r\npower, but no knowledge; and it was ruined, even as a too early-blowing\r\nbud is nipt by the killing frost.\r\n\r\nI did not accuse Evadne of hypocrisy or a wish to deceive her lover;\r\nbut the first letter that I saw of hers convinced me that she did not\r\nlove him; it was written with elegance, and, foreigner as she was, with\r\ngreat command of language. The hand-writing itself was exquisitely\r\nbeautiful; there was something in her very paper and its folds, which\r\neven I, who did not love, and was withal unskilled in such matters,\r\ncould discern as being tasteful. There was much kindness, gratitude,\r\nand sweetness in her expression, but no love. Evadne was two years\r\nolder than Adrian; and who, at eighteen, ever loved one so much their\r\njunior? I compared her placid epistles with the burning ones of Adrian.\r\nHis soul seemed to distil itself into the words he wrote; and they\r\nbreathed on the paper, bearing with them a portion of the life of love,\r\nwhich was his life. The very writing used to exhaust him; and he would\r\nweep over them, merely from the excess of emotion they awakened in his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAdrian\xe2\x80\x99s soul was painted in his countenance, and concealment or deceit\r\nwere at the antipodes to the dreadless frankness of his nature. Evadne\r\nmade it her earnest request that the tale of their loves should not be\r\nrevealed to his mother; and after for a while contesting the point, he\r\nyielded it to her. A vain concession; his demeanour quickly betrayed\r\nhis secret to the quick eyes of the ex-queen. With the same wary\r\nprudence that characterized her whole conduct, she concealed her\r\ndiscovery, but hastened to remove her son from the sphere of the\r\nattractive Greek. He was sent to Cumberland; but the plan of\r\ncorrespondence between the lovers, arranged by Evadne, was effectually\r\nhidden from her. Thus the absence of Adrian, concerted for the purpose\r\nof separating, united them in firmer bonds than ever. To me he\r\ndiscoursed ceaselessly of his beloved Ionian. Her country, its ancient\r\nannals, its late memorable struggles, were all made to partake in her\r\nglory and excellence. He submitted to be away from her, because she\r\ncommanded this submission; but for her influence, he would have\r\ndeclared his attachment before all England, and resisted, with unshaken\r\nconstancy, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s opposition. Evadne\xe2\x80\x99s feminine prudence\r\nperceived how useless any assertion of his resolves would be, till\r\nadded years gave weight to his power. Perhaps there was besides a\r\nlurking dislike to bind herself in the face of the world to one whom\r\nshe did not love\xe2\x80\x94not love, at least, with that passionate enthusiasm\r\nwhich her heart told her she might one day feel towards another. He\r\nobeyed her injunctions, and passed a year in exile in Cumberland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy, thrice happy, were the months, and weeks, and hours of that\r\nyear. Friendship, hand in hand with admiration, tenderness and respect,\r\nbuilt a bower of delight in my heart, late rough as an untrod wild in\r\nAmerica, as the homeless wind or herbless sea. Insatiate thirst for\r\nknowledge, and boundless affection for Adrian, combined to keep both my\r\nheart and understanding occupied, and I was consequently happy. What\r\nhappiness is so true and unclouded, as the overflowing and talkative\r\ndelight of young people. In our boat, upon my native lake, beside the\r\nstreams and the pale bordering poplars\xe2\x80\x94in valley and over hill, my\r\ncrook thrown aside, a nobler flock to tend than silly sheep, even a\r\nflock of new-born ideas, I read or listened to Adrian; and his\r\ndiscourse, whether it concerned his love or his theories for the\r\nimprovement of man, alike entranced me. Sometimes my lawless mood would\r\nreturn, my love of peril, my resistance to authority; but this was in\r\nhis absence; under the mild sway of his dear eyes, I was obedient and\r\ngood as a boy of five years old, who does his mother\xe2\x80\x99s bidding.\r\n\r\nAfter a residence of about a year at Ulswater, Adrian visited London,\r\nand came back full of plans for our benefit. You must begin life, he\r\nsaid: you are seventeen, and longer delay would render the necessary\r\napprenticeship more and more irksome. He foresaw that his own life\r\nwould be one of struggle, and I must partake his labours with him. The\r\nbetter to fit me for this task, we must now separate. He found my name\r\na good passport to preferment, and he had procured for me the situation\r\nof private secretary to the Ambassador at Vienna, where I should enter\r\non my career under the best auspices. In two years, I should return to\r\nmy country, with a name well known and a reputation already founded.\r\n\r\nAnd Perdita?\xe2\x80\x94Perdita was to become the pupil, friend and younger sister\r\nof Evadne. With his usual thoughtfulness, he had provided for her\r\nindependence in this situation. How refuse the offers of this generous\r\nfriend?\xe2\x80\x94I did not wish to refuse them; but in my heart of hearts, I\r\nmade a vow to devote life, knowledge, and power, all of which, in as\r\nmuch as they were of any value, he had bestowed on me\xe2\x80\x94all, all my\r\ncapacities and hopes, to him alone I would devote.\r\n\r\nThus I promised myself, as I journied towards my destination with\r\nroused and ardent expectation: expectation of the fulfilment of all\r\nthat in boyhood we promise ourselves of power and enjoyment in\r\nmaturity. Methought the time was now arrived, when, childish\r\noccupations laid aside, I should enter into life. Even in the Elysian\r\nfields, Virgil describes the souls of the happy as eager to drink of\r\nthe wave which was to restore them to this mortal coil. The young are\r\nseldom in Elysium, for their desires, outstripping possibility, leave\r\nthem as poor as a moneyless debtor. We are told by the wisest\r\nphilosophers of the dangers of the world, the deceits of men, and the\r\ntreason of our own hearts: but not the less fearlessly does each put\r\noff his frail bark from the port, spread the sail, and strain his oar,\r\nto attain the multitudinous streams of the sea of life. How few in\r\nyouth\xe2\x80\x99s prime, moor their vessels on the \xe2\x80\x9cgolden sands,\xe2\x80\x9d and collect\r\nthe painted shells that strew them. But all at close of day, with riven\r\nplanks and rent canvas make for shore, and are either wrecked ere they\r\nreach it, or find some wave-beaten haven, some desart strand, whereon\r\nto cast themselves and die unmourned.\r\n\r\nA truce to philosophy!\xe2\x80\x94Life is before me, and I rush into possession.\r\nHope, glory, love, and blameless ambition are my guides, and my soul\r\nknows no dread. What has been, though sweet, is gone; the present is\r\ngood only because it is about to change, and the to come is all my own.\r\nDo I fear, that my heart palpitates? high aspirations cause the flow of\r\nmy blood; my eyes seem to penetrate the cloudy midnight of time, and to\r\ndiscern within the depths of its darkness, the fruition of all my soul\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nNow pause!\xe2\x80\x94During my journey I might dream, and with buoyant wings\r\nreach the summit of life\xe2\x80\x99s high edifice. Now that I am arrived at its\r\nbase, my pinions are furled, the mighty stairs are before me, and step\r\nby step I must ascend the wondrous fane\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSpeak!\xe2\x80\x94What door is opened?\r\n\r\n\r\nBehold me in a new capacity. A diplomatist: one among the\r\npleasure-seeking society of a gay city; a youth of promise; favourite\r\nof the Ambassador. All was strange and admirable to the shepherd of\r\nCumberland. With breathless amaze I entered on the gay scene, whose\r\nactors were\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94the lilies glorious as Solomon,\r\nWho toil not, neither do they spin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon, too soon, I entered the giddy whirl; forgetting my studious\r\nhours, and the companionship of Adrian. Passionate desire of sympathy,\r\nand ardent pursuit for a wished-for object still characterized me. The\r\nsight of beauty entranced me, and attractive manners in man or woman\r\nwon my entire confidence. I called it rapture, when a smile made my\r\nheart beat; and I felt the life\xe2\x80\x99s blood tingle in my frame, when I\r\napproached the idol which for awhile I worshipped. The mere flow of\r\nanimal spirits was Paradise, and at night\xe2\x80\x99s close I only desired a\r\nrenewal of the intoxicating delusion. The dazzling light of ornamented\r\nrooms; lovely forms arrayed in splendid dresses; the motions of a\r\ndance, the voluptuous tones of exquisite music, cradled my senses in\r\none delightful dream.\r\n\r\nAnd is not this in its kind happiness? I appeal to moralists and sages.\r\nI ask if in the calm of their measured reveries, if in the deep\r\nmeditations which fill their hours, they feel the extasy of a youthful\r\ntyro in the school of pleasure? Can the calm beams of their\r\nheaven-seeking eyes equal the flashes of mingling passion which blind\r\nhis, or does the influence of cold philosophy steep their soul in a joy\r\nequal to his, engaged\r\n\r\nIn this dear work of youthful revelry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in truth, neither the lonely meditations of the hermit, nor the\r\ntumultuous raptures of the reveller, are capable of satisfying man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart. From the one we gather unquiet speculation, from the other\r\nsatiety. The mind flags beneath the weight of thought, and droops in\r\nthe heartless intercourse of those whose sole aim is amusement. There\r\nis no fruition in their vacant kindness, and sharp rocks lurk beneath\r\nthe smiling ripples of these shallow waters.\r\n\r\nThus I felt, when disappointment, weariness, and solitude drove me back\r\nupon my heart, to gather thence the joy of which it had become barren.\r\nMy flagging spirits asked for something to speak to the affections; and\r\nnot finding it, I drooped. Thus, notwithstanding the thoughtless\r\ndelight that waited on its commencement, the impression I have of my\r\nlife at Vienna is melancholy. Goethe has said, that in youth we cannot\r\nbe happy unless we love. I did not love; but I was devoured by a\r\nrestless wish to be something to others. I became the victim of\r\ningratitude and cold coquetry\xe2\x80\x94then I desponded, and imagined that my\r\ndiscontent gave me a right to hate the world. I receded to solitude; I\r\nhad recourse to my books, and my desire again to enjoy the society of\r\nAdrian became a burning thirst.\r\n\r\nEmulation, that in its excess almost assumed the venomous properties of\r\nenvy, gave a sting to these feelings. At this period the name and\r\nexploits of one of my countrymen filled the world with admiration.\r\nRelations of what he had done, conjectures concerning his future\r\nactions, were the never-failing topics of the hour. I was not angry on\r\nmy own account, but I felt as if the praises which this idol received\r\nwere leaves torn from laurels destined for Adrian. But I must enter\r\ninto some account of this darling of fame\xe2\x80\x94this favourite of the\r\nwonder-loving world.\r\n\r\nLord Raymond was the sole remnant of a noble but impoverished family.\r\nFrom early youth he had considered his pedigree with complacency, and\r\nbitterly lamented his want of wealth. His first wish was\r\naggrandisement; and the means that led towards this end were secondary\r\nconsiderations. Haughty, yet trembling to every demonstration of\r\nrespect; ambitious, but too proud to shew his ambition; willing to\r\nachieve honour, yet a votary of pleasure,\xe2\x80\x94 he entered upon life. He was\r\nmet on the threshold by some insult, real or imaginary; some repulse,\r\nwhere he least expected it; some disappointment, hard for his pride to\r\nbear. He writhed beneath an injury he was unable to revenge; and he\r\nquitted England with a vow not to return, till the good time should\r\narrive, when she might feel the power of him she now despised.\r\n\r\nHe became an adventurer in the Greek wars. His reckless courage and\r\ncomprehensive genius brought him into notice. He became the darling\r\nhero of this rising people. His foreign birth, and he refused to throw\r\noff his allegiance to his native country, alone prevented him from\r\nfilling the first offices in the state. But, though others might rank\r\nhigher in title and ceremony, Lord Raymond held a station above and\r\nbeyond all this. He led the Greek armies to victory; their triumphs\r\nwere all his own. When he appeared, whole towns poured forth their\r\npopulation to meet him; new songs were adapted to their national airs,\r\nwhose themes were his glory, valour, and munificence. A truce was\r\nconcluded between the Greeks and Turks. At the same time, Lord Raymond,\r\nby some unlooked-for chance, became the possessor of an immense fortune\r\nin England, whither he returned, crowned with glory, to receive the\r\nmeed of honour and distinction before denied to his pretensions. His\r\nproud heart rebelled against this change. In what was the despised\r\nRaymond not the same? If the acquisition of power in the shape of\r\nwealth caused this alteration, that power should they feel as an iron\r\nyoke. Power therefore was the aim of all his endeavours; aggrandizement\r\nthe mark at which he for ever shot. In open ambition or close intrigue,\r\nhis end was the same\xe2\x80\x94to attain the first station in his own country.\r\n\r\nThis account filled me with curiosity. The events that in succession\r\nfollowed his return to England, gave me keener feelings. Among his\r\nother advantages, Lord Raymond was supremely handsome; every one\r\nadmired him; of women he was the idol. He was courteous,\r\nhoney-tongued\xe2\x80\x94an adept in fascinating arts. What could not this man\r\nachieve in the busy English world? Change succeeded to change; the\r\nentire history did not reach me; for Adrian had ceased to write, and\r\nPerdita was a laconic correspondent. The rumour went that Adrian had\r\nbecome\xe2\x80\x94how write the fatal word\xe2\x80\x94mad: that Lord Raymond was the\r\nfavourite of the ex-queen, her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s destined husband. Nay, more,\r\nthat this aspiring noble revived the claim of the house of Windsor to\r\nthe crown, and that, on the event of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s incurable disorder and\r\nhis marriage with the sister, the brow of the ambitious Raymond might\r\nbe encircled with the magic ring of regality.\r\n\r\nSuch a tale filled the trumpet of many voiced fame; such a tale\r\nrendered my longer stay at Vienna, away from the friend of my youth,\r\nintolerable. Now I must fulfil my vow; now range myself at his side,\r\nand be his ally and support till death. Farewell to courtly pleasure;\r\nto politic intrigue; to the maze of passion and folly! All hail,\r\nEngland! Native England, receive thy child! thou art the scene of all\r\nmy hopes, the mighty theatre on which is acted the only drama that can,\r\nheart and soul, bear me along with it in its development. A voice most\r\nirresistible, a power omnipotent, drew me thither. After an absence of\r\ntwo years I landed on its shores, not daring to make any inquiries,\r\nfearful of every remark. My first visit would be to my sister, who\r\ninhabited a little cottage, a part of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s gift, on the borders of\r\nWindsor Forest. From her I should learn the truth concerning our\r\nprotector; I should hear why she had withdrawn from the protection of\r\nthe Princess Evadne, and be instructed as to the influence which this\r\novertopping and towering Raymond exercised over the fortunes of my\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nI had never before been in the neighbourhood of Windsor; the fertility\r\nand beauty of the country around now struck me with admiration, which\r\nencreased as I approached the antique wood. The ruins of majestic oaks\r\nwhich had grown, flourished, and decayed during the progress of\r\ncenturies, marked where the limits of the forest once reached, while\r\nthe shattered palings and neglected underwood shewed that this part was\r\ndeserted for the younger plantations, which owed their birth to the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, and now stood in the pride of\r\nmaturity. Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s humble dwelling was situated on the skirts of the\r\nmost ancient portion; before it was stretched Bishopgate Heath, which\r\ntowards the east appeared interminable, and was bounded to the west by\r\nChapel Wood and the grove of Virginia Water. Behind, the cottage was\r\nshadowed by the venerable fathers of the forest, under which the deer\r\ncame to graze, and which for the most part hollow and decayed, formed\r\nfantastic groups that contrasted with the regular beauty of the younger\r\ntrees. These, the offspring of a later period, stood erect and seemed\r\nready to advance fearlessly into coming time; while those out worn\r\nstragglers, blasted and broke, clung to each other, their weak boughs\r\nsighing as the wind buffetted them\xe2\x80\x94a weather-beaten crew.\r\n\r\nA light railing surrounded the garden of the cottage, which,\r\nlow-roofed, seemed to submit to the majesty of nature, and cower amidst\r\nthe venerable remains of forgotten time. Flowers, the children of the\r\nspring, adorned her garden and casements; in the midst of lowliness\r\nthere was an air of elegance which spoke the graceful taste of the\r\ninmate. With a beating heart I entered the enclosure; as I stood at the\r\nentrance, I heard her voice, melodious as it had ever been, which\r\nbefore I saw her assured me of her welfare.\r\n\r\nA moment more and Perdita appeared; she stood before me in the fresh\r\nbloom of youthful womanhood, different from and yet the same as the\r\nmountain girl I had left. Her eyes could not be deeper than they were\r\nin childhood, nor her countenance more expressive; but the expression\r\nwas changed and improved; intelligence sat on her brow; when she smiled\r\nher face was embellished by the softest sensibility, and her low,\r\nmodulated voice seemed tuned by love. Her person was formed in the most\r\nfeminine proportions; she was not tall, but her mountain life had given\r\nfreedom to her motions, so that her light step scarce made her\r\nfoot-fall heard as she tript across the hall to meet me. When we had\r\nparted, I had clasped her to my bosom with unrestrained warmth; we met\r\nagain, and new feelings were awakened; when each beheld the other,\r\nchildhood passed, as full grown actors on this changeful scene. The\r\npause was but for a moment; the flood of association and natural\r\nfeeling which had been checked, again rushed in full tide upon our\r\nhearts, and with tenderest emotion we were swiftly locked in each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s embrace.\r\n\r\nThis burst of passionate feeling over, with calmed thoughts we sat\r\ntogether, talking of the past and present. I alluded to the coldness of\r\nher letters; but the few minutes we had spent together sufficiently\r\nexplained the origin of this. New feelings had arisen within her, which\r\nshe was unable to express in writing to one whom she had only known in\r\nchildhood; but we saw each other again, and our intimacy was renewed as\r\nif nothing had intervened to check it. I detailed the incidents of my\r\nsojourn abroad, and then questioned her as to the changes that had\r\ntaken place at home, the causes of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s absence, and her secluded\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe tears that suffused my sister\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when I mentioned our friend,\r\nand her heightened colour seemed to vouch for the truth of the reports\r\nthat had reached me. But their import was too terrible for me to give\r\ninstant credit to my suspicion. Was there indeed anarchy in the sublime\r\nuniverse of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, did madness scatter the well-appointed\r\nlegions, and was he no longer the lord of his own soul? Beloved friend,\r\nthis ill world was no clime for your gentle spirit; you delivered up\r\nits governance to false humanity, which stript it of its leaves ere\r\nwinter-time, and laid bare its quivering life to the evil ministration\r\nof roughest winds. Have those gentle eyes, those \xe2\x80\x9cchannels of the soul\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlost their meaning, or do they only in their glare disclose the\r\nhorrible tale of its aberrations? Does that voice no longer \xe2\x80\x9cdiscourse\r\nexcellent music?\xe2\x80\x9d Horrible, most horrible! I veil my eyes in terror of\r\nthe change, and gushing tears bear witness to my sympathy for this\r\nunimaginable ruin.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to my request Perdita detailed the melancholy\r\ncircumstances that led to this event.\r\n\r\nThe frank and unsuspicious mind of Adrian, gifted as it was by every\r\nnatural grace, endowed with transcendant powers of intellect,\r\nunblemished by the shadow of defect (unless his dreadless independence\r\nof thought was to be construed into one), was devoted, even as a victim\r\nto sacrifice, to his love for Evadne. He entrusted to her keeping the\r\ntreasures of his soul, his aspirations after excellence, and his plans\r\nfor the improvement of mankind. As manhood dawned upon him, his schemes\r\nand theories, far from being changed by personal and prudential\r\nmotives, acquired new strength from the powers he felt arise within\r\nhim; and his love for Evadne became deep-rooted, as he each day became\r\nmore certain that the path he pursued was full of difficulty, and that\r\nhe must seek his reward, not in the applause or gratitude of his fellow\r\ncreatures, hardly in the success of his plans, but in the approbation\r\nof his own heart, and in her love and sympathy, which was to lighten\r\nevery toil and recompence every sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn solitude, and through many wanderings afar from the haunts of men,\r\nhe matured his views for the reform of the English government, and the\r\nimprovement of the people. It would have been well if he had concealed\r\nhis sentiments, until he had come into possession of the power which\r\nwould secure their practical development. But he was impatient of the\r\nyears that must intervene, he was frank of heart and fearless. He gave\r\nnot only a brief denial to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s schemes, but published his\r\nintention of using his influence to diminish the power of the\r\naristocracy, to effect a greater equalization of wealth and privilege,\r\nand to introduce a perfect system of republican government into\r\nEngland. At first his mother treated his theories as the wild ravings\r\nof inexperience. But they were so systematically arranged, and his\r\narguments so well supported, that though still in appearance\r\nincredulous, she began to fear him. She tried to reason with him, and\r\nfinding him inflexible, learned to hate him.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, this feeling was infectious. His enthusiasm for good\r\nwhich did not exist; his contempt for the sacredness of authority; his\r\nardour and imprudence were all at the antipodes of the usual routine of\r\nlife; the worldly feared him; the young and inexperienced did not\r\nunderstand the lofty severity of his moral views, and disliked him as a\r\nbeing different from themselves. Evadne entered but coldly into his\r\nsystems. She thought he did well to assert his own will, but she wished\r\nthat will to have been more intelligible to the multitude. She had none\r\nof the spirit of a martyr, and did not incline to share the shame and\r\ndefeat of a fallen patriot. She was aware of the purity of his motives,\r\nthe generosity of his disposition, his true and ardent attachment to\r\nher; and she entertained a great affection for him. He repaid this\r\nspirit of kindness with the fondest gratitude, and made her the\r\ntreasure-house of all his hopes.\r\n\r\nAt this time Lord Raymond returned from Greece. No two persons could be\r\nmore opposite than Adrian and he. With all the incongruities of his\r\ncharacter, Raymond was emphatically a man of the world. His passions\r\nwere violent; as these often obtained the mastery over him, he could\r\nnot always square his conduct to the obvious line of self-interest, but\r\nself-gratification at least was the paramount object with him. He\r\nlooked on the structure of society as but a part of the machinery which\r\nsupported the web on which his life was traced. The earth was spread\r\nout as an highway for him; the heavens built up as a canopy for him.\r\n\r\nAdrian felt that he made a part of a great whole. He owned affinity not\r\nonly with mankind, but all nature was akin to him; the mountains and\r\nsky were his friends; the winds of heaven and the offspring of earth\r\nhis playmates; while he the focus only of this mighty mirror, felt his\r\nlife mingle with the universe of existence. His soul was sympathy, and\r\ndedicated to the worship of beauty and excellence. Adrian and Raymond\r\nnow came into contact, and a spirit of aversion rose between them.\r\nAdrian despised the narrow views of the politician, and Raymond held in\r\nsupreme contempt the benevolent visions of the philanthropist.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of Raymond was formed the storm that laid waste at one\r\nfell blow the gardens of delight and sheltered paths which Adrian\r\nfancied that he had secured to himself, as a refuge from defeat and\r\ncontumely. Raymond, the deliverer of Greece, the graceful soldier, who\r\nbore in his mien a tinge of all that, peculiar to her native clime,\r\nEvadne cherished as most dear\xe2\x80\x94 Raymond was loved by Evadne. Overpowered\r\nby her new sensations, she did not pause to examine them, or to\r\nregulate her conduct by any sentiments except the tyrannical one which\r\nsuddenly usurped the empire of her heart. She yielded to its influence,\r\nand the too natural consequence in a mind unattuned to soft emotions\r\nwas, that the attentions of Adrian became distasteful to her. She grew\r\ncapricious; her gentle conduct towards him was exchanged for asperity\r\nand repulsive coldness. When she perceived the wild or pathetic appeal\r\nof his expressive countenance, she would relent, and for a while resume\r\nher ancient kindness. But these fluctuations shook to its depths the\r\nsoul of the sensitive youth; he no longer deemed the world subject to\r\nhim, because he possessed Evadne\xe2\x80\x99s love; he felt in every nerve that\r\nthe dire storms of the mental universe were about to attack his fragile\r\nbeing, which quivered at the expectation of its advent.\r\n\r\nPerdita, who then resided with Evadne, saw the torture that Adrian\r\nendured. She loved him as a kind elder brother; a relation to guide,\r\nprotect, and instruct her, without the too frequent tyranny of parental\r\nauthority. She adored his virtues, and with mixed contempt and\r\nindignation she saw Evadne pile drear sorrow on his head, for the sake\r\nof one who hardly marked her. In his solitary despair Adrian would\r\noften seek my sister, and in covered terms express his misery, while\r\nfortitude and agony divided the throne of his mind. Soon, alas! was one\r\nto conquer. Anger made no part of his emotion. With whom should he be\r\nangry? Not with Raymond, who was unconscious of the misery he\r\noccasioned; not with Evadne, for her his soul wept tears of blood\xe2\x80\x94poor,\r\nmistaken girl, slave not tyrant was she, and amidst his own anguish he\r\ngrieved for her future destiny. Once a writing of his fell into\r\nPerdita\xe2\x80\x99s hands; it was blotted with tears\xe2\x80\x94well might any blot it with\r\nthe like\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it began thus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis not the thing romance writers describe it;\r\ngoing through the measures of a dance, and after various evolutions\r\narriving at a conclusion, when the dancers may sit down and repose.\r\nWhile there is life there is action and change. We go on, each thought\r\nlinked to the one which was its parent, each act to a previous act. No\r\njoy or sorrow dies barren of progeny, which for ever generated and\r\ngenerating, weaves the chain that make our life:\r\n\r\nUn dia llama \xc3\xa0 otro dia\r\ny asi llama, y encadena\r\nllanto \xc3\xa0 llanto, y pena \xc3\xa0 pena.\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly disappointment is the guardian deity of human life; she sits at\r\nthe threshold of unborn time, and marshals the events as they come\r\nforth. Once my heart sat lightly in my bosom; all the beauty of the\r\nworld was doubly beautiful, irradiated by the sun-light shed from my\r\nown soul. O wherefore are love and ruin for ever joined in this our\r\nmortal dream? So that when we make our hearts a lair for that gently\r\nseeming beast, its companion enters with it, and pitilessly lays waste\r\nwhat might have been an home and a shelter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy degrees his health was shaken by his misery, and then his intellect\r\nyielded to the same tyranny. His manners grew wild; he was sometimes\r\nferocious, sometimes absorbed in speechless melancholy. Suddenly Evadne\r\nquitted London for Paris; he followed, and overtook her when the vessel\r\nwas about to sail; none knew what passed between them, but Perdita had\r\nnever seen him since; he lived in seclusion, no one knew where,\r\nattended by such persons as his mother selected for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Lord Raymond called at Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, on his way to\r\nWindsor Castle. My sister\xe2\x80\x99s heightened colour and sparkling eyes half\r\nrevealed her secret to me. He was perfectly self-possessed; he accosted\r\nus both with courtesy, seemed immediately to enter into our feelings,\r\nand to make one with us. I scanned his physiognomy, which varied as he\r\nspoke, yet was beautiful in every change. The usual expression of his\r\neyes was soft, though at times he could make them even glare with\r\nferocity; his complexion was colourless; and every trait spoke\r\npredominate self-will; his smile was pleasing, though disdain too often\r\ncurled his lips\xe2\x80\x94lips which to female eyes were the very throne of\r\nbeauty and love. His voice, usually gentle, often startled you by a\r\nsharp discordant note, which shewed that his usual low tone was rather\r\nthe work of study than nature. Thus full of contradictions, unbending\r\nyet haughty, gentle yet fierce, tender and again neglectful, he by some\r\nstrange art found easy entrance to the admiration and affection of\r\nwomen; now caressing and now tyrannizing over them according to his\r\nmood, but in every change a despot.\r\n\r\nAt the present time Raymond evidently wished to appear amiable. Wit,\r\nhilarity, and deep observation were mingled in his talk, rendering\r\nevery sentence that he uttered as a flash of light. He soon conquered\r\nmy latent distaste; I endeavoured to watch him and Perdita, and to keep\r\nin mind every thing I had heard to his disadvantage. But all appeared\r\nso ingenuous, and all was so fascinating, that I forgot everything\r\nexcept the pleasure his society afforded me. Under the idea of\r\ninitiating me in the scene of English politics and society, of which I\r\nwas soon to become a part, he narrated a number of anecdotes, and\r\nsketched many characters; his discourse, rich and varied, flowed on,\r\npervading all my senses with pleasure. But for one thing he would have\r\nbeen completely triumphant. He alluded to Adrian, and spoke of him with\r\nthat disparagement that the worldly wise always attach to enthusiasm.\r\nHe perceived the cloud gathering, and tried to dissipate it; but the\r\nstrength of my feelings would not permit me to pass thus lightly over\r\nthis sacred subject; so I said emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to remark, that\r\nI am devotedly attached to the Earl of Windsor; he is my best friend\r\nand benefactor. I reverence his goodness, I accord with his opinions,\r\nand bitterly lament his present, and I trust temporary, illness. That\r\nillness, from its peculiarity, makes it painful to me beyond words to\r\nhear him mentioned, unless in terms of respect and affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaymond replied; but there was nothing conciliatory in his reply. I saw\r\nthat in his heart he despised those dedicated to any but worldly idols.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdreams about something, love, honour, and\r\npleasure; you dream of friendship, and devote yourself to a maniac;\r\nwell, if that be your vocation, doubtless you are in the right to\r\nfollow it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSome reflection seemed to sting him, and the spasm of pain that for a\r\nmoment convulsed his countenance, checked my indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cHappy are\r\ndreamers,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cso that they be not awakened! Would I could\r\ndream! but \xe2\x80\x98broad and garish day\xe2\x80\x99 is the element in which I live; the\r\ndazzling glare of reality inverts the scene for me. Even the ghost of\r\nfriendship has departed, and love\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94He broke off; nor could I guess\r\nwhether the disdain that curled his lip was directed against the\r\npassion, or against himself for being its slave.\r\n\r\nThis account may be taken as a sample of my intercourse with Lord\r\nRaymond. I became intimate with him, and each day afforded me occasion\r\nto admire more and more his powerful and versatile talents, that\r\ntogether with his eloquence, which was graceful and witty, and his\r\nwealth now immense, caused him to be feared, loved, and hated beyond\r\nany other man in England.\r\n\r\nMy descent, which claimed interest, if not respect, my former\r\nconnection with Adrian, the favour of the ambassador, whose secretary I\r\nhad been, and now my intimacy with Lord Raymond, gave me easy access to\r\nthe fashionable and political circles of England. To my inexperience we\r\nat first appeared on the eve of a civil war; each party was violent,\r\nacrimonious, and unyielding. Parliament was divided by three factions,\r\naristocrats, democrats, and royalists. After Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s declared\r\npredeliction to the republican form of government, the latter party had\r\nnearly died away, chiefless, guideless; but, when Lord Raymond came\r\nforward as its leader, it revived with redoubled force. Some were\r\nroyalists from prejudice and ancient affection, and there were many\r\nmoderately inclined who feared alike the capricious tyranny of the\r\npopular party, and the unbending despotism of the aristocrats. More\r\nthan a third of the members ranged themselves under Raymond, and their\r\nnumber was perpetually encreasing. The aristocrats built their hopes on\r\ntheir preponderant wealth and influence; the reformers on the force of\r\nthe nation itself; the debates were violent, more violent the\r\ndiscourses held by each knot of politicians as they assembled to\r\narrange their measures. Opprobrious epithets were bandied about,\r\nresistance even to the death threatened; meetings of the populace\r\ndisturbed the quiet order of the country; except in war, how could all\r\nthis end? Even as the destructive flames were ready to break forth, I\r\nsaw them shrink back; allayed by the absence of the military, by the\r\naversion entertained by every one to any violence, save that of speech,\r\nand by the cordial politeness and even friendship of the hostile\r\nleaders when they met in private society. I was from a thousand motives\r\ninduced to attend minutely to the course of events, and watch each turn\r\nwith intense anxiety.\r\n\r\nI could not but perceive that Perdita loved Raymond; methought also\r\nthat he regarded the fair daughter of Verney with admiration and\r\ntenderness. Yet I knew that he was urging forward his marriage with the\r\npresumptive heiress of the Earldom of Windsor, with keen expectation of\r\nthe advantages that would thence accrue to him. All the ex-queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends were his friends; no week passed that he did not hold\r\nconsultations with her at Windsor.\r\n\r\nI had never seen the sister of Adrian. I had heard that she was lovely,\r\namiable, and fascinating. Wherefore should I see her? There are times\r\nwhen we have an indefinable sentiment of impending change for better or\r\nfor worse, to arise from an event; and, be it for better or for worse,\r\nwe fear the change, and shun the event. For this reason I avoided this\r\nhigh-born damsel. To me she was everything and nothing; her very name\r\nmentioned by another made me start and tremble; the endless discussion\r\nconcerning her union with Lord Raymond was real agony to me. Methought\r\nthat, Adrian withdrawn from active life, and this beauteous Idris, a\r\nvictim probably to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious schemes, I ought to come\r\nforward to protect her from undue influence, guard her from\r\nunhappiness, and secure to her freedom of choice, the right of every\r\nhuman being. Yet how was I to do this? She herself would disdain my\r\ninterference. Since then I must be an object of indifference or\r\ncontempt to her, better, far better avoid her, nor expose myself before\r\nher and the scornful world to the chance of playing the mad game of a\r\nfond, foolish Icarus. One day, several months after my return to\r\nEngland, I quitted London to visit my sister. Her society was my chief\r\nsolace and delight; and my spirits always rose at the expectation of\r\nseeing her. Her conversation was full of pointed remark and\r\ndiscernment; in her pleasant alcove, redolent with sweetest flowers,\r\nadorned by magnificent casts, antique vases, and copies of the finest\r\npictures of Raphael, Correggio, and Claude, painted by herself, I\r\nfancied myself in a fairy retreat untainted by and inaccessible to the\r\nnoisy contentions of politicians and the frivolous pursuits of fashion.\r\nOn this occasion, my sister was not alone; nor could I fail to\r\nrecognise her companion: it was Idris, the till now unseen object of my\r\nmad idolatry.\r\n\r\nIn what fitting terms of wonder and delight, in what choice expression\r\nand soft flow of language, can I usher in the loveliest, wisest, best?\r\nHow in poor assemblage of words convey the halo of glory that\r\nsurrounded her, the thousand graces that waited unwearied on her. The\r\nfirst thing that struck you on beholding that charming countenance was\r\nits perfect goodness and frankness; candour sat upon her brow,\r\nsimplicity in her eyes, heavenly benignity in her smile. Her tall slim\r\nfigure bent gracefully as a poplar to the breezy west, and her gait,\r\ngoddess-like, was as that of a winged angel new alit from heaven\xe2\x80\x99s high\r\nfloor; the pearly fairness of her complexion was stained by a pure\r\nsuffusion; her voice resembled the low, subdued tenor of a flute. It is\r\neasiest perhaps to describe by contrast. I have detailed the\r\nperfections of my sister; and yet she was utterly unlike Idris.\r\nPerdita, even where she loved, was reserved and timid; Idris was frank\r\nand confiding. The one recoiled to solitude, that she might there\r\nentrench herself from disappointment and injury; the other walked forth\r\nin open day, believing that none would harm her. Wordsworth has\r\ncompared a beloved female to two fair objects in nature; but his lines\r\nalways appeared to me rather a contrast than a similitude:\r\n\r\nA violet by a mossy stone\r\n    Half hidden from the eye,\r\nFair as a star when only one\r\n    Is shining in the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a violet was sweet Perdita, trembling to entrust herself to the\r\nvery air, cowering from observation, yet betrayed by her excellences;\r\nand repaying with a thousand graces the labour of those who sought her\r\nin her lonely bye-path. Idris was as the star, set in single splendour\r\nin the dim anadem of balmy evening; ready to enlighten and delight the\r\nsubject world, shielded herself from every taint by her unimagined\r\ndistance from all that was not like herself akin to heaven.\r\n\r\nI found this vision of beauty in Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s alcove, in earnest\r\nconversation with its inmate. When my sister saw me, she rose, and\r\ntaking my hand, said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is here, even at our wish; this is Lionel, my\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d Idris arose also, and bent on me her eyes of celestial blue,\r\nand with grace peculiar said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou hardly need an introduction; we have\r\na picture, highly valued by my father, which declares at once your\r\nname. Verney, you will acknowledge this tie, and as my brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend, I feel that I may trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, with lids humid with a tear and trembling voice, she continued\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear friends, do not think it strange that now, visiting you for the\r\nfirst time, I ask your assistance, and confide my wishes and fears to\r\nyou. To you alone do I dare speak; I have heard you commended by\r\nimpartial spectators; you are my brother\xe2\x80\x99s friends, therefore you must\r\nbe mine. What can I say? if you refuse to aid me, I am lost indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe cast up her eyes, while wonder held her auditors mute; then, as if\r\ncarried away by her feelings, she cried\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother! beloved, ill-fated\r\nAdrian! how speak of your misfortunes? Doubtless you have both heard\r\nthe current tale; perhaps believe the slander; but he is not mad! Were\r\nan angel from the foot of God\xe2\x80\x99s throne to assert it, never, never would\r\nI believe it. He is wronged, betrayed, imprisoned\xe2\x80\x94save him! Verney, you\r\nmust do this; seek him out in whatever part of the island he is\r\nimmured; find him, rescue him from his persecutors, restore him to\r\nhimself, to me\xe2\x80\x94on the wide earth I have none to love but only him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer earnest appeal, so sweetly and passionately expressed, filled me\r\nwith wonder and sympathy; and, when she added, with thrilling voice and\r\nlook, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you consent to undertake this enterprize?\xe2\x80\x9d I vowed, with\r\nenergy and truth, to devote myself in life and death to the restoration\r\nand welfare of Adrian. We then conversed on the plan I should pursue,\r\nand discussed the probable means of discovering his residence. While we\r\nwere in earnest discourse, Lord Raymond entered unannounced: I saw\r\nPerdita tremble and grow deadly pale, and the cheeks of Idris glow with\r\npurest blushes. He must have been astonished at our conclave, disturbed\r\nby it I should have thought; but nothing of this appeared; he saluted\r\nmy companions, and addressed me with a cordial greeting. Idris appeared\r\nsuspended for a moment, and then with extreme sweetness, she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Raymond, I confide in your goodness and honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSmiling haughtily, he bent his head, and replied, with emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou indeed confide, Lady Idris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe endeavoured to read his thought, and then answered with dignity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please. It is certainly best not to compromise oneself by any\r\nconcealment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cif I have offended. Whether you trust me or\r\nnot, rely on my doing my utmost to further your wishes, whatever they\r\nmay be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIdris smiled her thanks, and rose to take leave. Lord Raymond requested\r\npermission to accompany her to Windsor Castle, to which she consented,\r\nand they quitted the cottage together. My sister and I were left\xe2\x80\x94truly\r\nlike two fools, who fancied that they had obtained a golden treasure,\r\ntill daylight shewed it to be lead\xe2\x80\x94two silly, luckless flies, who had\r\nplayed in sunbeams and were caught in a spider\xe2\x80\x99s web. I leaned against\r\nthe casement, and watched those two glorious creatures, till they\r\ndisappeared in the forest-glades; and then I turned. Perdita had not\r\nmoved; her eyes fixed on the ground, her cheeks pale, her very lips\r\nwhite, motionless and rigid, every feature stamped by woe, she sat.\r\nHalf frightened, I would have taken her hand; but she shudderingly\r\nwithdrew it, and strove to collect herself. I entreated her to speak to\r\nme: \xe2\x80\x9cNot now,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cnor do you speak to me, my dear Lionel;\r\nyou _can_ say nothing, for you know nothing. I will see you to-morrow;\r\nin the meantime, adieu!\xe2\x80\x9d She rose, and walked from the room; but\r\npausing at the door, and leaning against it, as if her over-busy\r\nthoughts had taken from her the power of supporting herself, she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Raymond will probably return. Will you tell him that he must\r\nexcuse me to-day, for I am not well. I will see him to-morrow if he\r\nwishes it, and you also. You had better return to London with him; you\r\ncan there make the enquiries agreed upon, concerning the Earl of\r\nWindsor and visit me again to-morrow, before you proceed on your\r\njourney\xe2\x80\x94till then, farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke falteringly, and concluded with a heavy sigh. I gave my\r\nassent to her request; and she left me. I felt as if, from the order of\r\nthe systematic world, I had plunged into chaos, obscure, contrary,\r\nunintelligible. That Raymond should marry Idris was more than ever\r\nintolerable; yet my passion, though a giant from its birth, was too\r\nstrange, wild, and impracticable, for me to feel at once the misery I\r\nperceived in Perdita. How should I act? She had not confided in me; I\r\ncould not demand an explanation from Raymond without the hazard of\r\nbetraying what was perhaps her most treasured secret. I would obtain\r\nthe truth from her the following day\xe2\x80\x94in the mean time\xe2\x80\x94But, while I was\r\noccupied by multiplying reflections, Lord Raymond returned. He asked\r\nfor my sister; and I delivered her message. After musing on it for a\r\nmoment, he asked me if I were about to return to London, and if I would\r\naccompany him: I consented. He was full of thought, and remained silent\r\nduring a considerable part of our ride; at length he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\napologize to you for my abstraction; the truth is, Ryland\xe2\x80\x99s motion\r\ncomes on to-night, and I am considering my reply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRyland was the leader of the popular party, a hard-headed man, and in\r\nhis way eloquent; he had obtained leave to bring in a bill making it\r\ntreason to endeavour to change the present state of the English\r\ngovernment and the standing laws of the republic. This attack was\r\ndirected against Raymond and his machinations for the restoration of\r\nthe monarchy.\r\n\r\nRaymond asked me if I would accompany him to the House that evening. I\r\nremembered my pursuit for intelligence concerning Adrian; and, knowing\r\nthat my time would be fully occupied, I excused myself. \xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said my\r\ncompanion, \xe2\x80\x9cI can free you from your present impediment. You are going\r\nto make enquiries concerning the Earl of Windsor. I can answer them at\r\nonce, he is at the Duke of Athol\xe2\x80\x99s seat at Dunkeld. On the first\r\napproach of his disorder, he travelled about from one place to another;\r\nuntil, arriving at that romantic seclusion he refused to quit it, and\r\nwe made arrangements with the Duke for his continuing there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was hurt by the careless tone with which he conveyed this\r\ninformation, and replied coldly: \xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged to you for your\r\nintelligence, and will avail myself of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall, Verney,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand if you continue of the same mind, I\r\nwill facilitate your views. But first witness, I beseech you, the\r\nresult of this night\xe2\x80\x99s contest, and the triumph I am about to achieve,\r\nif I may so call it, while I fear that victory is to me defeat. What\r\ncan I do? My dearest hopes appear to be near their fulfilment. The\r\nex-queen gives me Idris; Adrian is totally unfitted to succeed to the\r\nearldom, and that earldom in my hands becomes a kingdom. By the\r\nreigning God it is true; the paltry earldom of Windsor shall no longer\r\ncontent him, who will inherit the rights which must for ever appertain\r\nto the person who possesses it. The Countess can never forget that she\r\nhas been a queen, and she disdains to leave a diminished inheritance to\r\nher children; her power and my wit will rebuild the throne, and this\r\nbrow will be clasped by a kingly diadem.\xe2\x80\x94I can do this\xe2\x80\x94I can marry\r\nIdris.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94-\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, his countenance darkened, and its expression\r\nchanged again and again under the influence of internal passion. I\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Lady Idris love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a question,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will of course, as I shall\r\nher, when we are married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou begin late,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, ironically, \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage is usually considered\r\nthe grave, and not the cradle of love. So you are about to love her,\r\nbut do not already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not catechise me, Lionel; I will do my duty by her, be assured.\r\nLove! I must steel my heart against _that_; expel it from its tower of\r\nstrength, barricade it out: the fountain of love must cease to play,\r\nits waters be dried up, and all passionate thoughts attendant on it\r\ndie\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, the love which would rule me, not that which I\r\nrule. Idris is a gentle, pretty, sweet little girl; it is impossible\r\nnot to have an affection for her, and I have a very sincere one; only\r\ndo not speak of love \xe2\x80\x94love, the tyrant and the tyrant-queller; love,\r\nuntil now my conqueror, now my slave; the hungry fire, the untameable\r\nbeast, the fanged snake\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94I will have nothing to do with that love.\r\nTell me, Lionel, do you consent that I should marry this young lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent his keen eyes upon me, and my uncontrollable heart swelled in\r\nmy bosom. I replied in a calm voice\xe2\x80\x94but how far from calm was the\r\nthought imaged by my still words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNever! I can never consent that Lady\r\nIdris should be united to one who does not love her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you love her yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Lordship might have spared that taunt; I do not, dare not love\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cshe does not love you. I would not\r\nmarry a reigning sovereign, were I not sure that her heart was free.\r\nBut, O, Lionel! a kingdom is a word of might, and gently sounding are\r\nthe terms that compose the style of royalty. Were not the mightiest men\r\nof the olden times kings? Alexander was a king; Solomon, the wisest of\r\nmen, was a king; Napoleon was a king; C\xc3\xa6sar died in his attempt to\r\nbecome one, and Cromwell, the puritan and king-killer, aspired to\r\nregality. The father of Adrian yielded up the already broken sceptre of\r\nEngland; but I will rear the fallen plant, join its dismembered frame,\r\nand exalt it above all the flowers of the field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not wonder that I freely discover Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s abode. Do not\r\nsuppose that I am wicked or foolish enough to found my purposed\r\nsovereignty on a fraud, and one so easily discovered as the truth or\r\nfalsehood of the Earl\xe2\x80\x99s insanity. I am just come from him. Before I\r\ndecided on my marriage with Idris, I resolved to see him myself again,\r\nand to judge of the probability of his recovery.\xe2\x80\x94He is irrecoverably\r\nmad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gasped for breath\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not detail to you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cthe melancholy\r\nparticulars. You shall see him, and judge for yourself; although I fear\r\nthis visit, useless to him, will be insufferably painful to you. It has\r\nweighed on my spirits ever since. Excellent and gentle as he is even in\r\nthe downfall of his reason, I do not worship him as you do, but I would\r\ngive all my hopes of a crown and my right hand to boot, to see him\r\nrestored to himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice expressed the deepest compassion: \xe2\x80\x9cThou most unaccountable\r\nbeing,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhither will thy actions tend, in all this maze of\r\npurpose in which thou seemest lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither indeed? To a crown, a golden be-gemmed crown, I hope; and yet\r\nI dare not trust and though I dream of a crown and wake for one, ever\r\nand anon a busy devil whispers to me, that it is but a fool\xe2\x80\x99s cap that\r\nI seek, and that were I wise, I should trample on it, and take in its\r\nstead, that which is worth all the crowns of the east and\r\npresidentships of the west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do make it my choice, then you shall know; at present I dare not\r\nspeak, even think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he was silent, and after a pause turned to me laughingly. When\r\nscorn did not inspire his mirth, when it was genuine gaiety that\r\npainted his features with a joyous expression, his beauty became\r\nsuper-eminent, divine. \xe2\x80\x9cVerney,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy first act when I become\r\nKing of England, will be to unite with the Greeks, take Constantinople,\r\nand subdue all Asia. I intend to be a warrior, a conqueror; Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname shall vail to mine; and enthusiasts, instead of visiting his rocky\r\ngrave, and exalting the merits of the fallen, shall adore my majesty,\r\nand magnify my illustrious achievements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI listened to Raymond with intense interest. Could I be other than all\r\near, to one who seemed to govern the whole earth in his grasping\r\nimagination, and who only quailed when he attempted to rule himself.\r\nThen on his word and will depended my own happiness\xe2\x80\x94the fate of all\r\ndear to me. I endeavoured to divine the concealed meaning of his words.\r\nPerdita\xe2\x80\x99s name was not mentioned; yet I could not doubt that love for\r\nher caused the vacillation of purpose that he exhibited. And who was so\r\nworthy of love as my noble-minded sister? Who deserved the hand of this\r\nself-exalted king more than she whose glance belonged to a queen of\r\nnations? who loved him, as he did her; notwithstanding that\r\ndisappointment quelled her passion, and ambition held strong combat\r\nwith his.\r\n\r\nWe went together to the House in the evening. Raymond, while he knew\r\nthat his plans and prospects were to be discussed and decided during\r\nthe expected debate, was gay and careless. An hum, like that of ten\r\nthousand hives of swarming bees, stunned us as we entered the\r\ncoffee-room. Knots of politicians were assembled with anxious brows and\r\nloud or deep voices. The aristocratical party, the richest and most\r\ninfluential men in England, appeared less agitated than the others, for\r\nthe question was to be discussed without their interference. Near the\r\nfire was Ryland and his supporters. Ryland was a man of obscure birth\r\nand of immense wealth, inherited from his father, who had been a\r\nmanufacturer. He had witnessed, when a young man, the abdication of the\r\nking, and the amalgamation of the two houses of Lords and Commons; he\r\nhad sympathized with these popular encroachments, and it had been the\r\nbusiness of his life to consolidate and encrease them. Since then, the\r\ninfluence of the landed proprietors had augmented; and at first Ryland\r\nwas not sorry to observe the machinations of Lord Raymond, which drew\r\noff many of his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s partizans. But the thing was now going too\r\nfar. The poorer nobility hailed the return of sovereignty, as an event\r\nwhich would restore them to their power and rights, now lost. The half\r\nextinct spirit of royalty roused itself in the minds of men; and they,\r\nwilling slaves, self-constituted subjects, were ready to bend their\r\nnecks to the yoke. Some erect and manly spirits still remained, pillars\r\nof state; but the word republic had grown stale to the vulgar ear; and\r\nmany\xe2\x80\x94the event would prove whether it was a majority\xe2\x80\x94 pined for the\r\ntinsel and show of royalty. Ryland was roused to resistance; he\r\nasserted that his sufferance alone had permitted the encrease of this\r\nparty; but the time for indulgence was passed, and with one motion of\r\nhis arm he would sweep away the cobwebs that blinded his countrymen.\r\n\r\nWhen Raymond entered the coffee-room, his presence was hailed by his\r\nfriends almost with a shout. They gathered round him, counted their\r\nnumbers, and detailed the reasons why they were now to receive an\r\naddition of such and such members, who had not yet declared themselves.\r\nSome trifling business of the House having been gone through, the\r\nleaders took their seats in the chamber; the clamour of voices\r\ncontinued, till Ryland arose to speak, and then the slightest whispered\r\nobservation was audible. All eyes were fixed upon him as he\r\nstood\xe2\x80\x94ponderous of frame, sonorous of voice, and with a manner which,\r\nthough not graceful, was impressive. I turned from his marked, iron\r\ncountenance to Raymond, whose face, veiled by a smile, would not betray\r\nhis care; yet his lips quivered somewhat, and his hand clasped the\r\nbench on which he sat, with a convulsive strength that made the muscles\r\nstart again.\r\n\r\nRyland began by praising the present state of the British empire. He\r\nrecalled past years to their memory; the miserable contentions which in\r\nthe time of our fathers arose almost to civil war, the abdication of\r\nthe late king, and the foundation of the republic. He described this\r\nrepublic; shewed how it gave privilege to each individual in the state,\r\nto rise to consequence, and even to temporary sovereignty. He compared\r\nthe royal and republican spirit; shewed how the one tended to enslave\r\nthe minds of men; while all the institutions of the other served to\r\nraise even the meanest among us to something great and good. He shewed\r\nhow England had become powerful, and its inhabitants valiant and wise,\r\nby means of the freedom they enjoyed. As he spoke, every heart swelled\r\nwith pride, and every cheek glowed with delight to remember, that each\r\none there was English, and that each supported and contributed to the\r\nhappy state of things now commemorated. Ryland\xe2\x80\x99s fervour increased\xe2\x80\x94his\r\neyes lighted up\xe2\x80\x94his voice assumed the tone of passion. There was one\r\nman, he continued, who wished to alter all this, and bring us back to\r\nour days of impotence and contention:\xe2\x80\x94one man, who would dare arrogate\r\nthe honour which was due to all who claimed England as their\r\nbirthplace, and set his name and style above the name and style of his\r\ncountry. I saw at this juncture that Raymond changed colour; his eyes\r\nwere withdrawn from the orator, and cast on the ground; the listeners\r\nturned from one to the other; but in the meantime the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nfilled their ears\xe2\x80\x94the thunder of his denunciations influenced their\r\nsenses. The very boldness of his language gave him weight; each knew\r\nthat he spoke truth\xe2\x80\x94a truth known, but not acknowledged. He tore from\r\nreality the mask with which she had been clothed; and the purposes of\r\nRaymond, which before had crept around, ensnaring by stealth, now stood\r\na hunted stag\xe2\x80\x94even at bay\xe2\x80\x94as all perceived who watched the\r\nirrepressible changes of his countenance. Ryland ended by moving, that\r\nany attempt to re-erect the kingly power should be declared treason,\r\nand he a traitor who should endeavour to change the present form of\r\ngovernment. Cheers and loud acclamations followed the close of his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nAfter his motion had been seconded, Lord Raymond rose,\xe2\x80\x94his countenance\r\nbland, his voice softly melodious, his manner soothing, his grace and\r\nsweetness came like the mild breathing of a flute, after the loud,\r\norgan-like voice of his adversary. He rose, he said, to speak in favour\r\nof the honourable member\xe2\x80\x99s motion, with one slight amendment subjoined.\r\nHe was ready to go back to old times, and commemorate the contests of\r\nour fathers, and the monarch\xe2\x80\x99s abdication. Nobly and greatly, he said,\r\nhad the illustrious and last sovereign of England sacrificed himself to\r\nthe apparent good of his country, and divested himself of a power which\r\ncould only be maintained by the blood of his subjects\xe2\x80\x94these subjects\r\nnamed so no more, these, his friends and equals, had in gratitude\r\nconferred certain favours and distinctions on him and his family for\r\never. An ample estate was allotted to them, and they took the first\r\nrank among the peers of Great Britain. Yet it might be conjectured that\r\nthey had not forgotten their ancient heritage; and it was hard that his\r\nheir should suffer alike with any other pretender, if he attempted to\r\nregain what by ancient right and inheritance belonged to him. He did\r\nnot say that he should favour such an attempt; but he did say that such\r\nan attempt would be venial; and, if the aspirant did not go so far as\r\nto declare war, and erect a standard in the kingdom, his fault ought to\r\nbe regarded with an indulgent eye. In his amendment he proposed, that\r\nan exception should be made in the bill in favour of any person who\r\nclaimed the sovereign power in right of the earls of Windsor. Nor did\r\nRaymond make an end without drawing in vivid and glowing colours, the\r\nsplendour of a kingdom, in opposition to the commercial spirit of\r\nrepublicanism. He asserted, that each individual under the English\r\nmonarchy, was then as now, capable of attaining high rank and\r\npower\xe2\x80\x94with one only exception, that of the function of chief\r\nmagistrate; higher and nobler rank, than a bartering, timorous\r\ncommonwealth could afford. And for this one exception, to what did it\r\namount? The nature of riches and influence forcibly confined the list\r\nof candidates to a few of the wealthiest; and it was much to be feared,\r\nthat the ill-humour and contention generated by this triennial\r\nstruggle, would counterbalance its advantages in impartial eyes. I can\r\nill record the flow of language and graceful turns of expression, the\r\nwit and easy raillery that gave vigour and influence to his speech. His\r\nmanner, timid at first, became firm\xe2\x80\x94his changeful face was lit up to\r\nsuperhuman brilliancy; his voice, various as music, was like that\r\nenchanting.\r\n\r\nIt were useless to record the debate that followed this harangue. Party\r\nspeeches were delivered, which clothed the question in cant, and veiled\r\nits simple meaning in a woven wind of words. The motion was lost;\r\nRyland withdrew in rage and despair; and Raymond, gay and exulting,\r\nretired to dream of his future kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there such a feeling as love at first sight? And if there be, in\r\nwhat does its nature differ from love founded in long observation and\r\nslow growth? Perhaps its effects are not so permanent; but they are,\r\nwhile they last, as violent and intense. We walk the pathless mazes of\r\nsociety, vacant of joy, till we hold this clue, leading us through that\r\nlabyrinth to paradise. Our nature dim, like to an unlighted torch,\r\nsleeps in formless blank till the fire attain it; this life of life,\r\nthis light to moon, and glory to the sun. What does it matter, whether\r\nthe fire be struck from flint and steel, nourished with care into a\r\nflame, slowly communicated to the dark wick, or whether swiftly the\r\nradiant power of light and warmth passes from a kindred power, and\r\nshines at once the beacon and the hope. In the deepest fountain of my\r\nheart the pulses were stirred; around, above, beneath, the clinging\r\nMemory as a cloak enwrapt me. In no one moment of coming time did I\r\nfeel as I had done in time gone by. The spirit of Idris hovered in the\r\nair I breathed; her eyes were ever and for ever bent on mine; her\r\nremembered smile blinded my faint gaze, and caused me to walk as one,\r\nnot in eclipse, not in darkness and vacancy\xe2\x80\x94but in a new and brilliant\r\nlight, too novel, too dazzling for my human senses. On every leaf, on\r\nevery small division of the universe, (as on the hyacinth \xce\xb1\xcf\x82 is\r\nengraved) was imprinted the talisman of my existence\xe2\x80\x94SHE LIVES! SHE IS!\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I had not time yet to analyze my feeling, to take myself to task, and\r\nleash in the tameless passion; all was one idea, one feeling, one\r\nknowledge \xe2\x80\x94it was my life!\r\n\r\nBut the die was cast\xe2\x80\x94Raymond would marry Idris. The merry marriage\r\nbells rung in my ears; I heard the nation\xe2\x80\x99s gratulation which followed\r\nthe union; the ambitious noble uprose with swift eagle-flight, from the\r\nlowly ground to regal supremacy\xe2\x80\x94and to the love of Idris. Yet, not so!\r\nShe did not love him; she had called me her friend; she had smiled on\r\nme; to me she had entrusted her heart\xe2\x80\x99s dearest hope, the welfare of\r\nAdrian. This reflection thawed my congealing blood, and again the tide\r\nof life and love flowed impetuously onward, again to ebb as my busy\r\nthoughts changed.\r\n\r\nThe debate had ended at three in the morning. My soul was in tumults; I\r\ntraversed the streets with eager rapidity. Truly, I was mad that night\xe2\x80\x94\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94which I have named a giant from its birth, wrestled with despair!\r\nMy heart, the field of combat, was wounded by the iron heel of the one,\r\nwatered by the gushing tears of the other. Day, hateful to me, dawned;\r\nI retreated to my lodgings\xe2\x80\x94I threw myself on a couch\xe2\x80\x94I slept\xe2\x80\x94was it\r\nsleep?\xe2\x80\x94for thought was still alive\xe2\x80\x94love and despair struggled still,\r\nand I writhed with unendurable pain.\r\n\r\nI awoke half stupefied; I felt a heavy oppression on me, but knew not\r\nwherefore; I entered, as it were, the council-chamber of my brain, and\r\nquestioned the various ministers of thought therein assembled; too soon\r\nI remembered all; too soon my limbs quivered beneath the tormenting\r\npower; soon, too soon, I knew myself a slave!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, unannounced, Lord Raymond entered my apartment. He came in\r\ngaily, singing the Tyrolese song of liberty; noticed me with a gracious\r\nnod, and threw himself on a sopha opposite the copy of a bust of the\r\nApollo Belvidere. After one or two trivial remarks, to which I sullenly\r\nreplied, he suddenly cried, looking at the bust, \xe2\x80\x9cI am called like that\r\nvictor! Not a bad idea; the head will serve for my new coinage, and be\r\nan omen to all dutiful subjects of my future success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said this in his most gay, yet benevolent manner, and smiled, not\r\ndisdainfully, but in playful mockery of himself. Then his countenance\r\nsuddenly darkened, and in that shrill tone peculiar to himself, he\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cI fought a good battle last night; higher conquest the plains\r\nof Greece never saw me achieve. Now I am the first man in the state,\r\nburthen of every ballad, and object of old women\xe2\x80\x99s mumbled devotions.\r\nWhat are your meditations? You, who fancy that you can read the human\r\nsoul, as your native lake reads each crevice and folding of its\r\nsurrounding hills\xe2\x80\x94say what you think of me; king-expectant, angel or\r\ndevil, which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis ironical tone was discord to my bursting, over-boiling-heart; I\r\nwas nettled by his insolence, and replied with bitterness; \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a\r\nspirit, neither angel or devil, damned to limbo merely.\xe2\x80\x9d I saw his\r\ncheeks become pale, and his lips whiten and quiver; his anger served\r\nbut to enkindle mine, and I answered with a determined look his eyes\r\nwhich glared on me; suddenly they were withdrawn, cast down, a tear, I\r\nthought, wetted the dark lashes; I was softened, and with involuntary\r\nemotion added, \xe2\x80\x9cNot that you are such, my dear lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI paused, even awed by the agitation he evinced; \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlength, rising and biting his lip, as he strove to curb his passion;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch am I! You do not know me, Verney; neither you, nor our audience\r\nof last night, nor does universal England know aught of me. I stand\r\nhere, it would seem, an elected king; this hand is about to grasp a\r\nsceptre; these brows feel in each nerve the coming diadem. I appear to\r\nhave strength, power, victory; standing as a dome-supporting column\r\nstands; and I am\xe2\x80\x94a reed! I have ambition, and that attains its aim; my\r\nnightly dreams are realized, my waking hopes fulfilled; a kingdom\r\nawaits my acceptance, my enemies are overthrown. But here,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nstruck his heart with violence, \xe2\x80\x9chere is the rebel, here the\r\nstumbling-block; this over-ruling heart, which I may drain of its\r\nliving blood; but, while one fluttering pulsation remains, I am its\r\nslave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a broken voice, then bowed his head, and, hiding his face\r\nin his hands, wept. I was still smarting from my own disappointment;\r\nyet this scene oppressed me even to terror, nor could I interrupt his\r\naccess of passion. It subsided at length; and, throwing himself on the\r\ncouch, he remained silent and motionless, except that his changeful\r\nfeatures shewed a strong internal conflict. At last he rose, and said\r\nin his usual tone of voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThe time grows on us, Verney, I must away.\r\nLet me not forget my chiefest errand here. Will you accompany me to\r\nWindsor to-morrow? You will not be dishonoured by my society, and as\r\nthis is probably the last service, or disservice you can do me, will\r\nyou grant my request?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand with almost a bashful air. Swiftly I thought\xe2\x80\x94Yes,\r\nI will witness the last scene of the drama. Beside which, his mien\r\nconquered me, and an affectionate sentiment towards him, again filled\r\nmy heart\xe2\x80\x94I bade him command me. \xe2\x80\x9cAye, that I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said he gaily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s my cue now; be with me to-morrow morning by seven; be secret\r\nand faithful; and you shall be groom of the stole ere long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he hastened away, vaulted on his horse, and with a gesture\r\nas if he gave me his hand to kiss, bade me another laughing adieu. Left\r\nto myself, I strove with painful intensity to divine the motive of his\r\nrequest and foresee the events of the coming day. The hours passed on\r\nunperceived; my head ached with thought, the nerves seemed teeming with\r\nthe over full fraught\xe2\x80\x94I clasped my burning brow, as if my fevered hand\r\ncould medicine its pain. I was punctual to the appointed hour on the\r\nfollowing day, and found Lord Raymond waiting for me. We got into his\r\ncarriage, and proceeded towards Windsor. I had tutored myself, and was\r\nresolved by no outward sign to disclose my internal agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a mistake Ryland made,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he thought to\r\noverpower me the other night. He spoke well, very well; such an\r\nharangue would have succeeded better addressed to me singly, than to\r\nthe fools and knaves assembled yonder. Had I been alone, I should have\r\nlistened to him with a wish to hear reason, but when he endeavoured to\r\nvanquish me in my own territory, with my own weapons, he put me on my\r\nmettle, and the event was such as all might have expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI smiled incredulously, and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI am of Ryland\xe2\x80\x99s way of thinking,\r\nand will, if you please, repeat all his arguments; we shall see how far\r\nyou will be induced by them, to change the royal for the patriotic\r\nstyle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe repetition would be useless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9csince I well remember\r\nthem, and have many others, self-suggested, which speak with\r\nunanswerable persuasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not explain himself, nor did I make any remark on his reply. Our\r\nsilence endured for some miles, till the country with open fields, or\r\nshady woods and parks, presented pleasant objects to our view. After\r\nsome observations on the scenery and seats, Raymond said: \xe2\x80\x9cPhilosophers\r\nhave called man a microcosm of nature, and find a reflection in the\r\ninternal mind for all this machinery visibly at work around us. This\r\ntheory has often been a source of amusement to me; and many an idle\r\nhour have I spent, exercising my ingenuity in finding resemblances.\r\nDoes not Lord Bacon say that, \xe2\x80\x98the falling from a discord to a concord,\r\nwhich maketh great sweetness in music, hath an agreement with the\r\naffections, which are re-integrated to the better after some dislikes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhat a sea is the tide of passion, whose fountains are in our own\r\nnature! Our virtues are the quick-sands, which shew themselves at calm\r\nand low water; but let the waves arise and the winds buffet them, and\r\nthe poor devil whose hope was in their durability, finds them sink from\r\nunder him. The fashions of the world, its exigencies, educations and\r\npursuits, are winds to drive our wills, like clouds all one way; but\r\nlet a thunderstorm arise in the shape of love, hate, or ambition, and\r\nthe rack goes backward, stemming the opposing air in triumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cnature always presents to our eyes the appearance of\r\na patient: while there is an active principle in man which is capable\r\nof ruling fortune, and at least of tacking against the gale, till it in\r\nsome mode conquers it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is more of what is specious than true in your distinction,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nmy companion. \xe2\x80\x9cDid we form ourselves, choosing our dispositions, and\r\nour powers? I find myself, for one, as a stringed instrument with\r\nchords and stops\xe2\x80\x94but I have no power to turn the pegs, or pitch my\r\nthoughts to a higher or lower key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther men,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be better musicians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI talk not of others, but myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am as fair\r\nan example to go by as another. I cannot set my heart to a particular\r\ntune, or run voluntary changes on my will. We are born; we choose\r\nneither our parents, nor our station; we are educated by others, or by\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s circumstance, and this cultivation, mingling with our\r\ninnate disposition, is the soil in which our desires, passions, and\r\nmotives grow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is much truth in what you say,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet no man ever\r\nacts upon this theory. Who, when he makes a choice, says, Thus I\r\nchoose, because I am necessitated? Does he not on the contrary feel a\r\nfreedom of will within him, which, though you may call it fallacious,\r\nstill actuates him as he decides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9canother link of the breakless chain.\r\nWere I now to commit an act which would annihilate my hopes, and pluck\r\nthe regal garment from my mortal limbs, to clothe them in ordinary\r\nweeds, would this, think you, be an act of free-will on my part?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we talked thus, I perceived that we were not going the ordinary road\r\nto Windsor, but through Englefield Green, towards Bishopgate Heath. I\r\nbegan to divine that Idris was not the object of our journey, but that\r\nI was brought to witness the scene that was to decide the fate of\r\nRaymond\xe2\x80\x94and of Perdita. Raymond had evidently vacillated during his\r\njourney, and irresolution was marked in every gesture as we entered\r\nPerdita\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. I watched him curiously, determined that, if this\r\nhesitation should continue, I would assist Perdita to overcome herself,\r\nand teach her to disdain the wavering love of him, who balanced between\r\nthe possession of a crown, and of her, whose excellence and affection\r\ntranscended the worth of a kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe found her in her flower-adorned alcove; she was reading the\r\nnewspaper report of the debate in parliament, that apparently doomed\r\nher to hopelessness. That heart-sinking feeling was painted in her sunk\r\neyes and spiritless attitude; a cloud was on her beauty, and frequent\r\nsighs were tokens of her distress. This sight had an instantaneous\r\neffect on Raymond; his eyes beamed with tenderness, and remorse clothed\r\nhis manners with earnestness and truth. He sat beside her; and, taking\r\nthe paper from her hand, said, \xe2\x80\x9cNot a word more shall my sweet Perdita\r\nread of this contention of madmen and fools. I must not permit you to\r\nbe acquainted with the extent of my delusion, lest you despise me;\r\nalthough, believe me, a wish to appear before you, not vanquished, but\r\nas a conqueror, inspired me during my wordy war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerdita looked at him like one amazed; her expressive countenance shone\r\nfor a moment with tenderness; to see him only was happiness. But a\r\nbitter thought swiftly shadowed her joy; she bent her eyes on the\r\nground, endeavouring to master the passion of tears that threatened to\r\noverwhelm her. Raymond continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not act a part with you, dear\r\ngirl, or appear other than what I am, weak and unworthy, more fit to\r\nexcite your disdain than your love. Yet you do love me; I feel and know\r\nthat you do, and thence I draw my most cherished hopes. If pride guided\r\nyou, or even reason, you might well reject me. Do so; if your high\r\nheart, incapable of my infirmity of purpose, refuses to bend to the\r\nlowness of mine. Turn from me, if you will,\xe2\x80\x94if you can. If your whole\r\nsoul does not urge you to forgive me\xe2\x80\x94if your entire heart does not open\r\nwide its door to admit me to its very centre, forsake me, never speak\r\nto me again. I, though sinning against you almost beyond remission, I\r\nalso am proud; there must be no reserve in your pardon\xe2\x80\x94no drawback to\r\nthe gift of your affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerdita looked down, confused, yet pleased. My presence embarrassed\r\nher; so that she dared not turn to meet her lover\xe2\x80\x99s eye, or trust her\r\nvoice to assure him of her affection; while a blush mantled her cheek,\r\nand her disconsolate air was exchanged for one expressive of deep-felt\r\njoy. Raymond encircled her waist with his arm, and continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not\r\ndeny that I have balanced between you and the highest hope that mortal\r\nmen can entertain; but I do so no longer. Take me\xe2\x80\x94mould me to your\r\nwill, possess my heart and soul to all eternity. If you refuse to\r\ncontribute to my happiness, I quit England to-night, and will never set\r\nfoot in it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLionel, you hear: witness for me: persuade your sister to forgive the\r\ninjury I have done her; persuade her to be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere needs no persuasion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the blushing Perdita, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept your\r\nown dear promises, and my ready heart, which whispers to me that they\r\nare true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat same evening we all three walked together in the forest, and, with\r\nthe garrulity which happiness inspires, they detailed to me the history\r\nof their loves. It was pleasant to see the haughty Raymond and reserved\r\nPerdita changed through happy love into prattling, playful children,\r\nboth losing their characteristic dignity in the fulness of mutual\r\ncontentment. A night or two ago Lord Raymond, with a brow of care, and\r\na heart oppressed with thought, bent all his energies to silence or\r\npersuade the legislators of England that a sceptre was not too weighty\r\nfor his hand, while visions of dominion, war, and triumph floated\r\nbefore him; now, frolicsome as a lively boy sporting under his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napproving eye, the hopes of his ambition were complete, when he pressed\r\nthe small fair hand of Perdita to his lips; while she, radiant with\r\ndelight, looked on the still pool, not truly admiring herself, but\r\ndrinking in with rapture the reflection there made of the form of\r\nherself and her lover, shewn for the first time in dear conjunction.\r\n\r\nI rambled away from them. If the rapture of assured sympathy was\r\ntheirs, I enjoyed that of restored hope. I looked on the regal towers\r\nof Windsor. High is the wall and strong the barrier that separate me\r\nfrom my Star of Beauty. But not impassible. She will not be his. A few\r\nmore years dwell in thy native garden, sweet flower, till I by toil and\r\ntime acquire a right to gather thee. Despair not, nor bid me despair!\r\nWhat must I do now? First I must seek Adrian, and restore him to her.\r\nPatience, gentleness, and untired affection, shall recall him, if it be\r\ntrue, as Raymond says, that he is mad; energy and courage shall rescue\r\nhim, if he be unjustly imprisoned.\r\n\r\nAfter the lovers again joined me, we supped together in the alcove.\r\nTruly it was a fairy\xe2\x80\x99s supper; for though the air was perfumed by the\r\nscent of fruits and wine, we none of us either ate or drank\xe2\x80\x94even the\r\nbeauty of the night was unobserved; their extasy could not be increased\r\nby outward objects, and I was wrapt in reverie. At about midnight\r\nRaymond and I took leave of my sister, to return to town. He was all\r\ngaiety; scraps of songs fell from his lips; every thought of his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94every object about us, gleamed under the sunshine of his mirth. He\r\naccused me of melancholy, of ill-humour and envy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I confess that my thoughts are not occupied\r\nas pleasantly as yours are. You promised to facilitate my visit to\r\nAdrian; I conjure you to perform your promise. I cannot linger here; I\r\nlong to soothe \xe2\x80\x94perhaps to cure the malady of my first and best friend.\r\nI shall immediately depart for Dunkeld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou bird of night,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat an eclipse do you throw\r\nacross my bright thoughts, forcing me to call to mind that melancholy\r\nruin, which stands in mental desolation, more irreparable than a\r\nfragment of a carved column in a weed-grown field. You dream that you\r\ncan restore him? Daedalus never wound so inextricable an error round\r\nMinotaur, as madness has woven about his imprisoned reason. Nor you,\r\nnor any other Theseus, can thread the labyrinth, to which perhaps some\r\nunkind Ariadne has the clue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou allude to Evadne Zaimi: but she is not in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd were she,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not advise her seeing him.\r\nBetter to decay in absolute delirium, than to be the victim of the\r\nmethodical unreason of ill-bestowed love. The long duration of his\r\nmalady has probably erased from his mind all vestige of her; and it\r\nwere well that it should never again be imprinted. You will find him at\r\nDunkeld; gentle and tractable he wanders up the hills, and through the\r\nwood, or sits listening beside the waterfall. You may see him\xe2\x80\x94his hair\r\nstuck with wild flowers \xe2\x80\x94his eyes full of untraceable meaning\xe2\x80\x94his voice\r\nbroken\xe2\x80\x94his person wasted to a shadow. He plucks flowers and weeds, and\r\nweaves chaplets of them, or sails yellow leaves and bits of bark on the\r\nstream, rejoicing in their safety, or weeping at their wreck. The very\r\nmemory half unmans me. By Heaven! the first tears I have shed since\r\nboyhood rushed scalding into my eyes when I saw him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt needed not this last account to spur me on to visit him. I only\r\ndoubted whether or not I should endeavour to see Idris again, before I\r\ndeparted. This doubt was decided on the following day. Early in the\r\nmorning Raymond came to me; intelligence had arrived that Adrian was\r\ndangerously ill, and it appeared impossible that his failing strength\r\nshould surmount the disorder. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9chis mother\r\nand sister set out for Scotland to see him once again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I go to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried; \xe2\x80\x9cthis very hour I will engage a sailing\r\nballoon; I shall be there in forty-eight hours at furthest, perhaps in\r\nless, if the wind is fair. Farewell, Raymond; be happy in having chosen\r\nthe better part in life. This turn of fortune revives me. I feared\r\nmadness, not sickness\xe2\x80\x94I have a presentiment that Adrian will not die;\r\nperhaps this illness is a crisis, and he may recover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything favoured my journey. The balloon rose about half a mile from\r\nthe earth, and with a favourable wind it hurried through the air, its\r\nfeathered vans cleaving the unopposing atmosphere. Notwithstanding the\r\nmelancholy object of my journey, my spirits were exhilarated by\r\nreviving hope, by the swift motion of the airy pinnace, and the balmy\r\nvisitation of the sunny air. The pilot hardly moved the plumed\r\nsteerage, and the slender mechanism of the wings, wide unfurled, gave\r\nforth a murmuring noise, soothing to the sense. Plain and hill, stream\r\nand corn-field, were discernible below, while we unimpeded sped on\r\nswift and secure, as a wild swan in his spring-tide flight. The machine\r\nobeyed the slightest motion of the helm; and, the wind blowing\r\nsteadily, there was no let or obstacle to our course. Such was the\r\npower of man over the elements; a power long sought, and lately won;\r\nyet foretold in by-gone time by the prince of poets, whose verses I\r\nquoted much to the astonishment of my pilot, when I told him how many\r\nhundred years ago they had been written:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nOh! human wit, thou can\xe2\x80\x99st invent much ill,\r\nThou searchest strange arts: who would think by skill,\r\nAn heavy man like a light bird should stray,\r\nAnd through the empty heavens find a way?\r\n\r\n\r\nI alighted at Perth; and, though much fatigued by a constant exposure\r\nto the air for many hours, I would not rest, but merely altering my\r\nmode of conveyance, I went by land instead of air, to Dunkeld. The sun\r\nwas rising as I entered the opening of the hills. After the revolution\r\nof ages Birnam hill was again covered with a young forest, while more\r\naged pines, planted at the very commencement of the nineteenth century\r\nby the then Duke of Athol, gave solemnity and beauty to the scene. The\r\nrising sun first tinged the pine tops; and my mind, rendered through my\r\nmountain education deeply susceptible of the graces of nature, and now\r\non the eve of again beholding my beloved and perhaps dying friend, was\r\nstrangely influenced by the sight of those distant beams: surely they\r\nwere ominous, and as such I regarded them, good omens for Adrian, on\r\nwhose life my happiness depended.\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! he lay stretched on a bed of sickness, his cheeks glowing\r\nwith the hues of fever, his eyes half closed, his breath irregular and\r\ndifficult. Yet it was less painful to see him thus, than to find him\r\nfulfilling the animal functions uninterruptedly, his mind sick the\r\nwhile. I established myself at his bedside; I never quitted it day or\r\nnight. Bitter task was it, to behold his spirit waver between death and\r\nlife: to see his warm cheek, and know that the very fire which burned\r\ntoo fiercely there, was consuming the vital fuel; to hear his moaning\r\nvoice, which might never again articulate words of love and wisdom; to\r\nwitness the ineffectual motions of his limbs, soon to be wrapt in their\r\nmortal shroud. Such for three days and nights appeared the consummation\r\nwhich fate had decreed for my labours, and I became haggard and\r\nspectre-like, through anxiety and watching. At length his eyes unclosed\r\nfaintly, yet with a look of returning life; he became pale and weak;\r\nbut the rigidity of his features was softened by approaching\r\nconvalescence. He knew me. What a brimful cup of joyful agony it was,\r\nwhen his face first gleamed with the glance of recognition\xe2\x80\x94when he\r\npressed my hand, now more fevered than his own, and when he pronounced\r\nmy name! No trace of his past insanity remained, to dash my joy with\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nThis same evening his mother and sister arrived. The Countess of\r\nWindsor was by nature full of energetic feeling; but she had very\r\nseldom in her life permitted the concentrated emotions of her heart to\r\nshew themselves on her features. The studied immovability of her\r\ncountenance; her slow, equable manner, and soft but unmelodious voice,\r\nwere a mask, hiding her fiery passions, and the impatience of her\r\ndisposition. She did not in the least resemble either of her children;\r\nher black and sparkling eye, lit up by pride, was totally unlike the\r\nblue lustre, and frank, benignant expression of either Adrian or Idris.\r\nThere was something grand and majestic in her motions, but nothing\r\npersuasive, nothing amiable. Tall, thin, and strait, her face still\r\nhandsome, her raven hair hardly tinged with grey, her forehead arched\r\nand beautiful, had not the eye-brows been somewhat scattered\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nimpossible not to be struck by her, almost to fear her. Idris appeared\r\nto be the only being who could resist her mother, notwithstanding the\r\nextreme mildness of her character. But there was a fearlessness and\r\nfrankness about her, which said that she would not encroach on\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s liberty, but held her own sacred and unassailable.\r\n\r\nThe Countess cast no look of kindness on my worn-out frame, though\r\nafterwards she thanked me coldly for my attentions. Not so Idris; her\r\nfirst glance was for her brother; she took his hand, she kissed his\r\neye-lids, and hung over him with looks of compassion and love. Her eyes\r\nglistened with tears when she thanked me, and the grace of her\r\nexpressions was enhanced, not diminished, by the fervour, which caused\r\nher almost to falter as she spoke. Her mother, all eyes and ears, soon\r\ninterrupted us; and I saw, that she wished to dismiss me quietly, as\r\none whose services, now that his relatives had arrived, were of no use\r\nto her son. I was harassed and ill, resolved not to give up my post,\r\nyet doubting in what way I should assert it; when Adrian called me, and\r\nclasping my hand, bade me not leave him. His mother, apparently\r\ninattentive, at once understood what was meant, and seeing the hold we\r\nhad upon her, yielded the point to us.\r\n\r\nThe days that followed were full of pain to me; so that I sometimes\r\nregretted that I had not yielded at once to the haughty lady, who\r\nwatched all my motions, and turned my beloved task of nursing my friend\r\nto a work of pain and irritation. Never did any woman appear so\r\nentirely made of mind, as the Countess of Windsor. Her passions had\r\nsubdued her appetites, even her natural wants; she slept little, and\r\nhardly ate at all; her body was evidently considered by her as a mere\r\nmachine, whose health was necessary for the accomplishment of her\r\nschemes, but whose senses formed no part of her enjoyment. There is\r\nsomething fearful in one who can thus conquer the animal part of our\r\nnature, if the victory be not the effect of consummate virtue; nor was\r\nit without a mixture of this feeling, that I beheld the figure of the\r\nCountess awake when others slept, fasting when I, abstemious naturally,\r\nand rendered so by the fever that preyed on me, was forced to recruit\r\nmyself with food. She resolved to prevent or diminish my opportunities\r\nof acquiring influence over her children, and circumvented my plans by\r\na hard, quiet, stubborn resolution, that seemed not to belong to flesh\r\nand blood. War was at last tacitly acknowledged between us. We had many\r\npitched battles, during which no word was spoken, hardly a look was\r\ninterchanged, but in which each resolved not to submit to the other.\r\nThe Countess had the advantage of position; so I was vanquished, though\r\nI would not yield.\r\n\r\nI became sick at heart. My countenance was painted with the hues of ill\r\nhealth and vexation. Adrian and Idris saw this; they attributed it to\r\nmy long watching and anxiety; they urged me to rest, and take care of\r\nmyself, while I most truly assured them, that my best medicine was\r\ntheir good wishes; those, and the assured convalescence of my friend,\r\nnow daily more apparent. The faint rose again blushed on his cheek; his\r\nbrow and lips lost the ashy paleness of threatened dissolution; such\r\nwas the dear reward of my unremitting attention\xe2\x80\x94and bounteous heaven\r\nadded overflowing recompence, when it gave me also the thanks and\r\nsmiles of Idris.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a few weeks, we left Dunkeld. Idris and her mother\r\nreturned immediately to Windsor, while Adrian and I followed by slow\r\njournies and frequent stoppages, occasioned by his continued weakness.\r\nAs we traversed the various counties of fertile England, all wore an\r\nexhilarating appearance to my companion, who had been so long secluded\r\nby disease from the enjoyments of weather and scenery. We passed\r\nthrough busy towns and cultivated plains. The husbandmen were getting\r\nin their plenteous harvests, and the women and children, occupied by\r\nlight rustic toils, formed groupes of happy, healthful persons, the\r\nvery sight of whom carried cheerfulness to the heart. One evening,\r\nquitting our inn, we strolled down a shady lane, then up a grassy\r\nslope, till we came to an eminence, that commanded an extensive view of\r\nhill and dale, meandering rivers, dark woods, and shining villages. The\r\nsun was setting; and the clouds, straying, like new-shorn sheep,\r\nthrough the vast fields of sky, received the golden colour of his\r\nparting beams; the distant uplands shone out, and the busy hum of\r\nevening came, harmonized by distance, on our ear. Adrian, who felt all\r\nthe fresh spirit infused by returning health, clasped his hands in\r\ndelight, and exclaimed with transport:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO happy earth, and happy inhabitants of earth! A stately palace has\r\nGod built for you, O man! and worthy are you of your dwelling! Behold\r\nthe verdant carpet spread at our feet, and the azure canopy above; the\r\nfields of earth which generate and nurture all things, and the track of\r\nheaven, which contains and clasps all things. Now, at this evening\r\nhour, at the period of repose and refection, methinks all hearts\r\nbreathe one hymn of love and thanksgiving, and we, like priests of old\r\non the mountain-tops, give a voice to their sentiment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly a most benignant power built up the majestic fabric we\r\ninhabit, and framed the laws by which it endures. If mere existence,\r\nand not happiness, had been the final end of our being, what need of\r\nthe profuse luxuries which we enjoy? Why should our dwelling place be\r\nso lovely, and why should the instincts of nature minister pleasurable\r\nsensations? The very sustaining of our animal machine is made\r\ndelightful; and our sustenance, the fruits of the field, is painted\r\nwith transcendant hues, endued with grateful odours, and palatable to\r\nour taste. Why should this be, if HE were not good? We need houses to\r\nprotect us from the seasons, and behold the materials with which we are\r\nprovided; the growth of trees with their adornment of leaves; while\r\nrocks of stone piled above the plains variegate the prospect with their\r\npleasant irregularity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor are outward objects alone the receptacles of the Spirit of Good.\r\nLook into the mind of man, where wisdom reigns enthroned; where\r\nimagination, the painter, sits, with his pencil dipt in hues lovelier\r\nthan those of sunset, adorning familiar life with glowing tints. What a\r\nnoble boon, worthy the giver, is the imagination! it takes from reality\r\nits leaden hue: it envelopes all thought and sensation in a radiant\r\nveil, and with an hand of beauty beckons us from the sterile seas of\r\nlife, to her gardens, and bowers, and glades of bliss. And is not love\r\na gift of the divinity? Love, and her child, Hope, which can bestow\r\nwealth on poverty, strength on the weak, and happiness on the\r\nsorrowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lot has not been fortunate. I have consorted long with grief,\r\nentered the gloomy labyrinth of madness, and emerged, but half alive.\r\nYet I thank God that I have lived! I thank God, that I have beheld his\r\nthrone, the heavens, and earth, his footstool. I am glad that I have\r\nseen the changes of his day; to behold the sun, fountain of light, and\r\nthe gentle pilgrim moon; to have seen the fire bearing flowers of the\r\nsky, and the flowery stars of earth; to have witnessed the sowing and\r\nthe harvest. I am glad that I have loved, and have experienced\r\nsympathetic joy and sorrow with my fellow-creatures. I am glad now to\r\nfeel the current of thought flow through my mind, as the blood through\r\nthe articulations of my frame; mere existence is pleasure; and I thank\r\nGod that I live!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all ye happy nurslings of mother-earth, do ye not echo my words?\r\nYe who are linked by the affectionate ties of nature, companions,\r\nfriends, lovers! fathers, who toil with joy for their offspring; women,\r\nwho while gazing on the living forms of their children, forget the\r\npains of maternity; children, who neither toil nor spin, but love and\r\nare loved!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that death and sickness were banished from our earthly home! that\r\nhatred, tyranny, and fear could no longer make their lair in the human\r\nheart! that each man might find a brother in his fellow, and a nest of\r\nrepose amid the wide plains of his inheritance! that the source of\r\ntears were dry, and that lips might no longer form expressions of\r\nsorrow. Sleeping thus under the beneficent eye of heaven, can evil\r\nvisit thee, O Earth, or grief cradle to their graves thy luckless\r\nchildren? Whisper it not, let the demons hear and rejoice! The choice\r\nis with us; let us will it, and our habitation becomes a paradise. For\r\nthe will of man is omnipotent, blunting the arrows of death, soothing\r\nthe bed of disease, and wiping away the tears of agony. And what is\r\neach human being worth, if he do not put forth his strength to aid his\r\nfellow-creatures? My soul is a fading spark, my nature frail as a spent\r\nwave; but I dedicate all of intellect and strength that remains to me,\r\nto that one work, and take upon me the task, as far as I am able, of\r\nbestowing blessings on my fellow-men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled, his eyes were cast up, his hands clasped, and his\r\nfragile person was bent, as it were, with excess of emotion. The spirit\r\nof life seemed to linger in his form, as a dying flame on an altar\r\nflickers on the embers of an accepted sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Windsor, I found that Raymond and Perdita had\r\ndeparted for the continent. I took possession of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s cottage,\r\nand blessed myself that I lived within view of Windsor Castle. It was a\r\ncurious fact, that at this period, when by the marriage of Perdita I\r\nwas allied to one of the richest individuals in England, and was bound\r\nby the most intimate friendship to its chiefest noble, I experienced\r\nthe greatest excess of poverty that I had ever known. My knowledge of\r\nthe worldly principles of Lord Raymond, would have ever prevented me\r\nfrom applying to him, however deep my distress might have been. It was\r\nin vain that I repeated to myself with regard to Adrian, that his purse\r\nwas open to me; that one in soul, as we were, our fortunes ought also\r\nto be common. I could never, while with him, think of his bounty as a\r\nremedy to my poverty; and I even put aside hastily his offers of\r\nsupplies, assuring him of a falsehood, that I needed them not. How\r\ncould I say to this generous being, \xe2\x80\x9cMaintain me in idleness. You who\r\nhave dedicated your powers of mind and fortune to the benefit of your\r\nspecies, shall you so misdirect your exertions, as to support in\r\nuselessness the strong, healthy, and capable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd yet I dared not request him to use his influence that I might\r\nobtain an honourable provision for myself\xe2\x80\x94for then I should have been\r\nobliged to leave Windsor. I hovered for ever around the walls of its\r\nCastle, beneath its enshadowing thickets; my sole companions were my\r\nbooks and my loving thoughts. I studied the wisdom of the ancients, and\r\ngazed on the happy walls that sheltered the beloved of my soul. My mind\r\nwas nevertheless idle. I pored over the poetry of old times; I studied\r\nthe metaphysics of Plato and Berkeley. I read the histories of Greece\r\nand Rome, and of England\xe2\x80\x99s former periods, and I watched the movements\r\nof the lady of my heart. At night I could see her shadow on the walls\r\nof her apartment; by day I viewed her in her flower-garden, or riding\r\nin the park with her usual companions. Methought the charm would be\r\nbroken if I were seen, but I heard the music of her voice and was\r\nhappy. I gave to each heroine of whom I read, her beauty and matchless\r\nexcellences\xe2\x80\x94such was Antigone, when she guided the blind \xc5\x92dipus to the\r\ngrove of the Eumenides, and discharged the funeral rites of Polynices;\r\nsuch was Miranda in the unvisited cave of Prospero; such Haidee, on the\r\nsands of the Ionian island. I was mad with excess of passionate\r\ndevotion; but pride, tameless as fire, invested my nature, and\r\nprevented me from betraying myself by word or look.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, while I thus pampered myself with rich mental\r\nrepasts, a peasant would have disdained my scanty fare, which I\r\nsometimes robbed from the squirrels of the forest. I was, I own, often\r\ntempted to recur to the lawless feats of my boy-hood, and knock down\r\nthe almost tame pheasants that perched upon the trees, and bent their\r\nbright eyes on me. But they were the property of Adrian, the nurslings\r\nof Idris; and so, although my imagination rendered sensual by\r\nprivation, made me think that they would better become the spit in my\r\nkitchen, than the green leaves of the forest,\r\n\r\n    Nathelesse,\r\nI checked my haughty will, and did not eat;\r\n\r\n\r\nbut supped upon sentiment, and dreamt vainly of \xe2\x80\x9csuch morsels sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas I might not waking attain.\r\n\r\nBut, at this period, the whole scheme of my existence was about to\r\nchange. The orphan and neglected son of Verney, was on the eve of being\r\nlinked to the mechanism of society by a golden chain, and to enter into\r\nall the duties and affections of life. Miracles were to be wrought in\r\nmy favour, the machine of social life pushed with vast effort backward.\r\nAttend, O reader! while I narrate this tale of wonders!\r\n\r\nOne day as Adrian and Idris were riding through the forest, with their\r\nmother and accustomed companions, Idris, drawing her brother aside from\r\nthe rest of the cavalcade, suddenly asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat had become of his\r\nfriend, Lionel Verney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven from this spot,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Adrian, pointing to my sister\xe2\x80\x99s cottage,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou can see his dwelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Idris, \xe2\x80\x9cand why, if he be so near, does he not come to\r\nsee us, and make one of our society?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often visit him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Adrian; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you may easily guess the\r\nmotives, which prevent him from coming where his presence may annoy any\r\none among us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do guess them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Idris, \xe2\x80\x9cand such as they are, I would not\r\nventure to combat them. Tell me, however, in what way he passes his\r\ntime; what he is doing and thinking in his cottage retreat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my sweet sister,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9cyou ask me more than I can\r\nwell answer; but if you feel interest in him, why not visit him? He\r\nwill feel highly honoured, and thus you may repay a part of the\r\nobligation I owe him, and compensate for the injuries fortune has done\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will most readily accompany you to his abode,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\nthat I wish that either of us should unburthen ourselves of our debt,\r\nwhich, being no less than your life, must remain unpayable ever. But\r\nlet us go; to-morrow we will arrange to ride out together, and\r\nproceeding towards that part of the forest, call upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next evening therefore, though the autumnal change had brought on\r\ncold and rain, Adrian and Idris entered my cottage. They found me\r\nCurius-like, feasting on sorry fruits for supper; but they brought\r\ngifts richer than the golden bribes of the Sabines, nor could I refuse\r\nthe invaluable store of friendship and delight which they bestowed.\r\nSurely the glorious twins of Latona were not more welcome, when, in the\r\ninfancy of the world, they were brought forth to beautify and enlighten\r\nthis \xe2\x80\x9csterile promontory,\xe2\x80\x9d than were this angelic pair to my lowly\r\ndwelling and grateful heart. We sat like one family round my hearth.\r\nOur talk was on subjects, unconnected with the emotions that evidently\r\noccupied each; but we each divined the other\xe2\x80\x99s thought, and as our\r\nvoices spoke of indifferent matters, our eyes, in mute language, told a\r\nthousand things no tongue could have uttered.\r\n\r\nThey left me in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time. They left me happy\xe2\x80\x94how unspeakably\r\nhappy. It did not require the measured sounds of human language to\r\nsyllable the story of my extasy. Idris had visited me; Idris I should\r\nagain and again see\xe2\x80\x94my imagination did not wander beyond the\r\ncompleteness of this knowledge. I trod air; no doubt, no fear, no hope\r\neven, disturbed me; I clasped with my soul the fulness of contentment,\r\nsatisfied, undesiring, beatified.\r\n\r\nFor many days Adrian and Idris continued to visit me thus. In this dear\r\nintercourse, love, in the guise of enthusiastic friendship, infused\r\nmore and more of his omnipotent spirit. Idris felt it. Yes, divinity of\r\nthe world, I read your characters in her looks and gesture; I heard\r\nyour melodious voice echoed by her\xe2\x80\x94you prepared for us a soft and\r\nflowery path, all gentle thoughts adorned it\xe2\x80\x94your name, O Love, was not\r\nspoken, but you stood the Genius of the Hour, veiled, and time, but no\r\nmortal hand, might raise the curtain. Organs of articulate sound did\r\nnot proclaim the union of our hearts; for untoward circumstance allowed\r\nno opportunity for the expression that hovered on our lips. Oh my pen!\r\nhaste thou to write what was, before the thought of what is, arrests\r\nthe hand that guides thee. If I lift up my eyes and see the desart\r\nearth, and feel that those dear eyes have spent their mortal lustre,\r\nand that those beauteous lips are silent, their \xe2\x80\x9ccrimson leaves\xe2\x80\x9d faded,\r\nfor ever I am mute!\r\n\r\nBut you live, my Idris, even now you move before me! There was a glade,\r\nO reader! a grassy opening in the wood; the retiring trees left its\r\nvelvet expanse as a temple for love; the silver Thames bounded it on\r\none side, and a willow bending down dipt in the water its Naiad hair,\r\ndishevelled by the wind\xe2\x80\x99s viewless hand. The oaks around were the home\r\nof a tribe of nightingales\xe2\x80\x94there am I now; Idris, in youth\xe2\x80\x99s dear\r\nprime, is by my side \xe2\x80\x94remember, I am just twenty-two, and seventeen\r\nsummers have scarcely passed over the beloved of my heart. The river\r\nswollen by autumnal rains, deluged the low lands, and Adrian in his\r\nfavourite boat is employed in the dangerous pastime of plucking the\r\ntopmost bough from a submerged oak. Are you weary of life, O Adrian,\r\nthat you thus play with danger?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe has obtained his prize, and he pilots his boat through the flood;\r\nour eyes were fixed on him fearfully, but the stream carried him away\r\nfrom us; he was forced to land far lower down, and to make a\r\nconsiderable circuit before he could join us. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is safe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Idris,\r\nas he leapt on shore, and waved the bough over his head in token of\r\nsuccess; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will wait for him here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were alone together; the sun had set; the song of the nightingales\r\nbegan; the evening star shone distinct in the flood of light, which was\r\nyet unfaded in the west. The blue eyes of my angelic girl were fixed on\r\nthis sweet emblem of herself: \xe2\x80\x9cHow the light palpitates,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhich is that star\xe2\x80\x99s life. Its vacillating effulgence seems to say\r\nthat its state, even like ours upon earth, is wavering and inconstant;\r\nit fears, methinks, and it loves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGaze not on the star, dear, generous friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cread not love\r\nin _its_ trembling rays; look not upon distant worlds; speak not of the\r\nmere imagination of a sentiment. I have long been silent; long even to\r\nsickness have I desired to speak to you, and submit my soul, my life,\r\nmy entire being to you. Look not on the star, dear love, or do, and let\r\nthat eternal spark plead for me; let it be my witness and my advocate,\r\nsilent as it shines\xe2\x80\x94love is to me as light to the star; even so long as\r\nthat is uneclipsed by annihilation, so long shall I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVeiled for ever to the world\xe2\x80\x99s callous eye must be the transport of\r\nthat moment. Still do I feel her graceful form press against my\r\nfull-fraught heart\xe2\x80\x94still does sight, and pulse, and breath sicken and\r\nfail, at the remembrance of that first kiss. Slowly and silently we\r\nwent to meet Adrian, whom we heard approaching.\r\n\r\nI entreated Adrian to return to me after he had conducted his sister\r\nhome. And that same evening, walking among the moon-lit forest paths, I\r\npoured forth my whole heart, its transport and its hope, to my friend.\r\nFor a moment he looked disturbed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI might have foreseen this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat strife will now ensue! Pardon me, Lionel, nor wonder that the\r\nexpectation of contest with my mother should jar me, when else I should\r\ndelightedly confess that my best hopes are fulfilled, in confiding my\r\nsister to your protection. If you do not already know it, you will soon\r\nlearn the deep hate my mother bears to the name Verney. I will converse\r\nwith Idris; then all that a friend can do, I will do; to her it must\r\nbelong to play the lover\xe2\x80\x99s part, if she be capable of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the brother and sister were still hesitating in what manner they\r\ncould best attempt to bring their mother over to their party, she,\r\nsuspecting our meetings, taxed her children with them; taxed her fair\r\ndaughter with deceit, and an unbecoming attachment for one whose only\r\nmerit was being the son of the profligate favourite of her imprudent\r\nfather; and who was doubtless as worthless as he from whom he boasted\r\nhis descent. The eyes of Idris flashed at this accusation; she replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not deny that I love Verney; prove to me that he is worthless;\r\nand I will never see him more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9clet me entreat you to see him, to cultivate\r\nhis friendship. You will wonder then, as I do, at the extent of his\r\naccomplishments, and the brilliancy of his talents.\xe2\x80\x9d (Pardon me, gentle\r\nreader, this is not futile vanity;\xe2\x80\x94not futile, since to know that\r\nAdrian felt thus, brings joy even now to my lone heart).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMad and foolish boy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the angry lady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have chosen with\r\ndreams and theories to overthrow my schemes for your own\r\naggrandizement; but you shall not do the same by those I have formed\r\nfor your sister. I but too well understand the fascination you both\r\nlabour under; since I had the same struggle with your father, to make\r\nhim cast off the parent of this youth, who hid his evil propensities\r\nwith the smoothness and subtlety of a viper. In those days how often\r\ndid I hear of his attractions, his wide spread conquests, his wit, his\r\nrefined manners. It is well when flies only are caught by such spiders\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwebs; but is it for the high-born and powerful to bow their necks to\r\nthe flimsy yoke of these unmeaning pretensions? Were your sister indeed\r\nthe insignificant person she deserves to be, I would willingly leave\r\nher to the fate, the wretched fate, of the wife of a man, whose very\r\nperson, resembling as it does his wretched father, ought to remind you\r\nof the folly and vice it typifies\xe2\x80\x94but remember, Lady Idris, it is not\r\nalone the once royal blood of England that colours your veins, you are\r\na Princess of Austria, and every life-drop is akin to emperors and\r\nkings. Are you then a fit mate for an uneducated shepherd-boy, whose\r\nonly inheritance is his father\xe2\x80\x99s tarnished name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make but one defence,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Idris, \xe2\x80\x9cthe same offered by my\r\nbrother; see Lionel, converse with my shepherd-boy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94-The Countess\r\ninterrupted her indignantly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYours!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she cried: and then, smoothing her\r\nimpassioned features to a disdainful smile, she continued\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWe will talk\r\nof this another time. All I now ask, all your mother, Idris, requests\r\nis, that you will not see this upstart during the interval of one\r\nmonth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare not comply,\xe2\x80\x9d said Idris, \xe2\x80\x9cit would pain him too much. I have no\r\nright to play with his feelings, to accept his proffered love, and then\r\nsting him with neglect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is going too far,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother answered, with quivering lips, and\r\neyes again instinct by anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9cunless my sister consent never to see him\r\nagain, it is surely an useless torment to separate them for a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the ex-queen, with bitter scorn, \xe2\x80\x9chis love, and\r\nher love, and both their childish flutterings, are to be put in fit\r\ncomparison with my years of hope and anxiety, with the duties of the\r\noffspring of kings, with the high and dignified conduct which one of\r\nher descent ought to pursue. But it is unworthy of me to argue and\r\ncomplain. Perhaps you will have the goodness to promise me not to marry\r\nduring that interval?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was asked only half ironically; and Idris wondered why her mother\r\nshould extort from her a solemn vow not to do, what she had never\r\ndreamed of doing\xe2\x80\x94but the promise was required and given.\r\n\r\nAll went on cheerfully now; we met as usual, and talked without dread\r\nof our future plans. The Countess was so gentle, and even beyond her\r\nwont, amiable with her children, that they began to entertain hopes of\r\nher ultimate consent. She was too unlike them, too utterly alien to\r\ntheir tastes, for them to find delight in her society, or in the\r\nprospect of its continuance, but it gave them pleasure to see her\r\nconciliating and kind. Once even, Adrian ventured to propose her\r\nreceiving me. She refused with a smile, reminding him that for the\r\npresent his sister had promised to be patient.\r\n\r\nOne day, after the lapse of nearly a month, Adrian received a letter\r\nfrom a friend in London, requesting his immediate presence for the\r\nfurtherance of some important object. Guileless himself, Adrian feared\r\nno deceit. I rode with him as far as Staines: he was in high spirits;\r\nand, since I could not see Idris during his absence, he promised a\r\nspeedy return. His gaiety, which was extreme, had the strange effect of\r\nawakening in me contrary feelings; a presentiment of evil hung over me;\r\nI loitered on my return; I counted the hours that must elapse before I\r\nsaw Idris again. Wherefore should this be? What evil might not happen\r\nin the mean time? Might not her mother take advantage of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence to urge her beyond her sufferance, perhaps to entrap her? I\r\nresolved, let what would befall, to see and converse with her the\r\nfollowing day. This determination soothed me. To-morrow, loveliest and\r\nbest, hope and joy of my life, to-morrow I will see thee\xe2\x80\x94Fool, to dream\r\nof a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay!\r\n\r\nI went to rest. At past midnight I was awaked by a violent knocking. It\r\nwas now deep winter; it had snowed, and was still snowing; the wind\r\nwhistled in the leafless trees, despoiling them of the white flakes as\r\nthey fell; its drear moaning, and the continued knocking, mingled\r\nwildly with my dreams\xe2\x80\x94 at length I was wide awake; hastily dressing\r\nmyself, I hurried to discover the cause of this disturbance, and to\r\nopen my door to the unexpected visitor. Pale as the snow that showered\r\nabout her, with clasped hands, Idris stood before me. \xe2\x80\x9cSave me!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed, and would have sunk to the ground had I not supported her.\r\nIn a moment however she revived, and, with energy, almost with\r\nviolence, entreated me to saddle horses, to take her away, away to\r\nLondon\xe2\x80\x94to her brother\xe2\x80\x94at least to save her. I had no horses\xe2\x80\x94she wrung\r\nher hands. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI am lost\xe2\x80\x94we are both for ever\r\nlost! But come\xe2\x80\x94come with me, Lionel; here I must not stay,\xe2\x80\x94we can get a\r\nchaise at the nearest post-house; yet perhaps we have time! come, O\r\ncome with me to save and protect me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I heard her piteous demands, while with disordered dress,\r\ndishevelled hair, and aghast looks, she wrung her hands\xe2\x80\x94the idea shot\r\nacross me is she also mad?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSweet one,\xe2\x80\x9d and I folded her to my heart,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbetter repose than wander further;\xe2\x80\x94rest\xe2\x80\x94my beloved, I will make a\r\nfire\xe2\x80\x94you are chill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9crepose! you rave, Lionel! If you delay we are lost;\r\ncome, I pray you, unless you would cast me off for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat Idris, the princely born, nursling of wealth and luxury, should\r\nhave come through the tempestuous winter-night from her regal abode,\r\nand standing at my lowly door, conjure me to fly with her through\r\ndarkness and storm\xe2\x80\x94was surely a dream\xe2\x80\x94again her plaintive tones, the\r\nsight of her loveliness assured me that it was no vision. Looking\r\ntimidly around, as if she feared to be overheard, she whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave discovered\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow \xe2\x80\x94that is, to-day\xe2\x80\x94already the to-morrow is\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x94before dawn, foreigners, Austrians, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s hirelings, are to\r\ncarry me off to Germany, to prison, to marriage\xe2\x80\x94to anything, except you\r\nand my brother \xe2\x80\x94take me away, or soon they will be here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was frightened by her vehemence, and imagined some mistake in her\r\nincoherent tale; but I no longer hesitated to obey her. She had come by\r\nherself from the Castle, three long miles, at midnight, through the\r\nheavy snow; we must reach Englefield Green, a mile and a half further,\r\nbefore we could obtain a chaise. She told me, that she had kept up her\r\nstrength and courage till her arrival at my cottage, and then both\r\nfailed. Now she could hardly walk. Supporting her as I did, still she\r\nlagged: and at the distance of half a mile, after many stoppages,\r\nshivering fits, and half faintings, she slipt from my supporting arm on\r\nthe snow, and with a torrent of tears averred that she must be taken,\r\nfor that she could not proceed. I lifted her up in my arms; her light\r\nform rested on my breast.\xe2\x80\x94I felt no burthen, except the internal one of\r\ncontrary and contending emotions. Brimming delight now invested me.\r\nAgain her chill limbs touched me as a torpedo; and I shuddered in\r\nsympathy with her pain and fright. Her head lay on my shoulder, her\r\nbreath waved my hair, her heart beat near mine, transport made me\r\ntremble, blinded me, annihilated me\xe2\x80\x94till a suppressed groan, bursting\r\nfrom her lips, the chattering of her teeth, which she strove vainly to\r\nsubdue, and all the signs of suffering she evinced, recalled me to the\r\nnecessity of speed and succour. At last I said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nEnglefield Green; there the inn. But, if you are seen thus strangely\r\ncircumstanced, dear Idris, even now your enemies may learn your flight\r\ntoo soon: were it not better that I hired the chaise alone? I will put\r\nyou in safety meanwhile, and return to you immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered that I was right, and might do with her as I pleased. I\r\nobserved the door of a small out-house a-jar. I pushed it open; and,\r\nwith some hay strewed about, I formed a couch for her, placing her\r\nexhausted frame on it, and covering her with my cloak. I feared to\r\nleave her, she looked so wan and faint\xe2\x80\x94but in a moment she re-acquired\r\nanimation, and, with that, fear; and again she implored me not to\r\ndelay. To call up the people of the inn, and obtain a conveyance and\r\nhorses, even though I harnessed them myself, was the work of many\r\nminutes; minutes, each freighted with the weight of ages. I caused the\r\nchaise to advance a little, waited till the people of the inn had\r\nretired, and then made the post-boy draw up the carriage to the spot\r\nwhere Idris, impatient, and now somewhat recovered, stood waiting for\r\nme. I lifted her into the chaise; I assured her that with our four\r\nhorses we should arrive in London before five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the hour when\r\nshe would be sought and missed. I besought her to calm herself; a\r\nkindly shower of tears relieved her, and by degrees she related her\r\ntale of fear and peril.\r\n\r\nThat same night after Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s departure, her mother had warmly\r\nexpostulated with her on the subject of her attachment to me. Every\r\nmotive, every threat, every angry taunt was urged in vain. She seemed\r\nto consider that through me she had lost Raymond; I was the evil\r\ninfluence of her life; I was even accused of encreasing and confirming\r\nthe mad and base apostacy of Adrian from all views of advancement and\r\ngrandeur; and now this miserable mountaineer was to steal her daughter.\r\nNever, Idris related, did the angry lady deign to recur to gentleness\r\nand persuasion; if she had, the task of resistance would have been\r\nexquisitely painful. As it was, the sweet girl\xe2\x80\x99s generous nature was\r\nroused to defend, and ally herself with, my despised cause. Her mother\r\nended with a look of contempt and covert triumph, which for a moment\r\nawakened the suspicions of Idris. When they parted for the night, the\r\nCountess said, \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow I trust your tone will be changed: be\r\ncomposed; I have agitated you; go to rest; and I will send you a\r\nmedicine I always take when unduly restless\xe2\x80\x94it will give you a quiet\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the time that she had with uneasy thoughts laid her fair cheek upon\r\nher pillow, her mother\xe2\x80\x99s servant brought a draught; a suspicion again\r\ncrossed her at this novel proceeding, sufficiently alarming to\r\ndetermine her not to take the potion; but dislike of contention, and a\r\nwish to discover whether there was any just foundation for her\r\nconjectures, made her, she said, almost instinctively, and in\r\ncontradiction to her usual frankness, pretend to swallow the medicine.\r\nThen, agitated as she had been by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s violence, and now by\r\nunaccustomed fears, she lay unable to sleep, starting at every sound.\r\nSoon her door opened softly, and on her springing up, she heard a\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9cNot asleep yet,\xe2\x80\x9d and the door again closed. With a beating\r\nheart she expected another visit, and when after an interval her\r\nchamber was again invaded, having first assured herself that the\r\nintruders were her mother and an attendant, she composed herself to\r\nfeigned sleep. A step approached her bed, she dared not move, she\r\nstrove to calm her palpitations, which became more violent, when she\r\nheard her mother say mutteringly, \xe2\x80\x9cPretty simpleton, little do you\r\nthink that your game is already at an end for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment the poor girl fancied that her mother believed that she\r\nhad drank poison: she was on the point of springing up; when the\r\nCountess, already at a distance from the bed, spoke in a low voice to\r\nher companion, and again Idris listened: \xe2\x80\x9cHasten,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is\r\nno time to lose\xe2\x80\x94 it is long past eleven; they will be here at five;\r\ntake merely the clothes necessary for her journey, and her\r\njewel-casket.\xe2\x80\x9d The servant obeyed; few words were spoken on either\r\nside; but those were caught at with avidity by the intended victim. She\r\nheard the name of her own maid mentioned;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her mother,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe does not go with us; Lady Idris must forget England, and all\r\nbelonging to it.\xe2\x80\x9d And again she heard, \xe2\x80\x9cShe will not wake till late\r\nto-morrow, and we shall then be at sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAll is ready,\xe2\x80\x9d at length the\r\nwoman announced. The Countess again came to her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s bedside: \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nAustria at least,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will obey. In Austria, where\r\nobedience can be enforced, and no choice left but between an honourable\r\nprison and a fitting marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth then withdrew; though, as she went, the Countess said, \xe2\x80\x9cSoftly;\r\nall sleep; though all have not been prepared for sleep, like her. I\r\nwould not have any one suspect, or she might be roused to resistance,\r\nand perhaps escape. Come with me to my room; we will remain there till\r\nthe hour agreed upon.\xe2\x80\x9d They went. Idris, panic-struck, but animated and\r\nstrengthened even by her excessive fear, dressed herself hurriedly, and\r\ngoing down a flight of back-stairs, avoiding the vicinity of her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, she contrived to escape from the castle by a low\r\nwindow, and came through snow, wind, and obscurity to my cottage; nor\r\nlost her courage, until she arrived, and, depositing her fate in my\r\nhands, gave herself up to the desperation and weariness that\r\noverwhelmed her.\r\n\r\nI comforted her as well as I might. Joy and exultation, were mine, to\r\npossess, and to save her. Yet not to excite fresh agitation in her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_per non turbar quel bel viso sereno_,\xe2\x80\x9d I curbed my delight. I strove\r\nto quiet the eager dancing of my heart; I turned from her my eyes,\r\nbeaming with too much tenderness, and proudly, to dark night, and the\r\ninclement atmosphere, murmured the expressions of my transport. We\r\nreached London, methought, all too soon; and yet I could not regret our\r\nspeedy arrival, when I witnessed the extasy with which my beloved girl\r\nfound herself in her brother\xe2\x80\x99s arms, safe from every evil, under his\r\nunblamed protection.\r\n\r\nAdrian wrote a brief note to his mother, informing her that Idris was\r\nunder his care and guardianship. Several days elapsed, and at last an\r\nanswer came, dated from Cologne. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was useless,\xe2\x80\x9d the haughty and\r\ndisappointed lady wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the Earl of Windsor and his sister to\r\naddress again the injured parent, whose only expectation of\r\ntranquillity must be derived from oblivion of their existence. Her\r\ndesires had been blasted, her schemes overthrown. She did not complain;\r\nin her brother\xe2\x80\x99s court she would find, not compensation for their\r\ndisobedience (filial unkindness admitted of none), but such a state of\r\nthings and mode of life, as might best reconcile her to her fate. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, she positively declined any communication with\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the strange and incredible events, that finally brought about\r\nmy union with the sister of my best friend, with my adored Idris. With\r\nsimplicity and courage she set aside the prejudices and opposition\r\nwhich were obstacles to my happiness, nor scrupled to give her hand,\r\nwhere she had given her heart. To be worthy of her, to raise myself to\r\nher height through the exertion of talents and virtue, to repay her\r\nlove with devoted, unwearied tenderness, were the only thanks I could\r\noffer for the matchless gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now let the reader, passing over some short period of time, be\r\nintroduced to our happy circle. Adrian, Idris and I, were established\r\nin Windsor Castle; Lord Raymond and my sister, inhabited a house which\r\nthe former had built on the borders of the Great Park, near Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncottage, as was still named the low-roofed abode, where we two, poor\r\neven in hope, had each received the assurance of our felicity. We had\r\nour separate occupations and our common amusements. Sometimes we passed\r\nwhole days under the leafy covert of the forest with our books and\r\nmusic. This occurred during those rare days in this country, when the\r\nsun mounts his etherial throne in unclouded majesty, and the windless\r\natmosphere is as a bath of pellucid and grateful water, wrapping the\r\nsenses in tranquillity. When the clouds veiled the sky, and the wind\r\nscattered them there and here, rending their woof, and strewing its\r\nfragments through the aerial plains\xe2\x80\x94then we rode out, and sought new\r\nspots of beauty and repose. When the frequent rains shut us within\r\ndoors, evening recreation followed morning study, ushered in by music\r\nand song. Idris had a natural musical talent; and her voice, which had\r\nbeen carefully cultivated, was full and sweet. Raymond and I made a\r\npart of the concert, and Adrian and Perdita were devout listeners. Then\r\nwe were as gay as summer insects, playful as children; we ever met one\r\nanother with smiles, and read content and joy in each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenances. Our prime festivals were held in Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s cottage; nor\r\nwere we ever weary of talking of the past or dreaming of the future.\r\nJealousy and disquiet were unknown among us; nor did a fear or hope of\r\nchange ever disturb our tranquillity. Others said, We might be happy\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94We are.\r\n\r\nWhen any separation took place between us, it generally so happened,\r\nthat Idris and Perdita would ramble away together, and we remained to\r\ndiscuss the affairs of nations, and the philosophy of life. The very\r\ndifference of our dispositions gave zest to these conversations. Adrian\r\nhad the superiority in learning and eloquence; but Raymond possessed a\r\nquick penetration, and a practical knowledge of life, which usually\r\ndisplayed itself in opposition to Adrian, and thus kept up the ball of\r\ndiscussion. At other times we made excursions of many days\xe2\x80\x99 duration,\r\nand crossed the country to visit any spot noted for beauty or\r\nhistorical association. Sometimes we went up to London, and entered\r\ninto the amusements of the busy throng; sometimes our retreat was\r\ninvaded by visitors from among them. This change made us only the more\r\nsensible to the delights of the intimate intercourse of our own circle,\r\nthe tranquillity of our divine forest, and our happy evenings in the\r\nhalls of our beloved Castle.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of Idris was peculiarly frank, soft, and affectionate.\r\nHer temper was unalterably sweet; and although firm and resolute on any\r\npoint that touched her heart, she was yielding to those she loved. The\r\nnature of Perdita was less perfect; but tenderness and happiness\r\nimproved her temper, and softened her natural reserve. Her\r\nunderstanding was clear and comprehensive, her imagination vivid; she\r\nwas sincere, generous, and reasonable. Adrian, the matchless brother of\r\nmy soul, the sensitive and excellent Adrian, loving all, and beloved by\r\nall, yet seemed destined not to find the half of himself, which was to\r\ncomplete his happiness. He often left us, and wandered by himself in\r\nthe woods, or sailed in his little skiff, his books his only\r\ncompanions. He was often the gayest of our party, at the same time that\r\nhe was the only one visited by fits of despondency; his slender frame\r\nseemed overcharged with the weight of life, and his soul appeared\r\nrather to inhabit his body than unite with it. I was hardly more\r\ndevoted to my Idris than to her brother, and she loved him as her\r\nteacher, her friend, the benefactor who had secured to her the\r\nfulfilment of her dearest wishes. Raymond, the ambitious, restless\r\nRaymond, reposed midway on the great high-road of life, and was content\r\nto give up all his schemes of sovereignty and fame, to make one of us,\r\nthe flowers of the field. His kingdom was the heart of Perdita, his\r\nsubjects her thoughts; by her he was loved, respected as a superior\r\nbeing, obeyed, waited on. No office, no devotion, no watching was\r\nirksome to her, as it regarded him. She would sit apart from us and\r\nwatch him; she would weep for joy to think that he was hers. She\r\nerected a temple for him in the depth of her being, and each faculty\r\nwas a priestess vowed to his service. Sometimes she might be wayward\r\nand capricious; but her repentance was bitter, her return entire, and\r\neven this inequality of temper suited him who was not formed by nature\r\nto float idly down the stream of life.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of their marriage, Perdita presented Raymond with\r\na lovely girl. It was curious to trace in this miniature model the very\r\ntraits of its father. The same half-disdainful lips and smile of\r\ntriumph, the same intelligent eyes, the same brow and chestnut hair;\r\nher very hands and taper fingers resembled his. How very dear she was\r\nto Perdita! In progress of time, I also became a father, and our little\r\ndarlings, our playthings and delights, called forth a thousand new and\r\ndelicious feelings.\r\n\r\nYears passed thus,\xe2\x80\x94even years. Each month brought forth its successor,\r\neach year one like to that gone by; truly, our lives were a living\r\ncomment on that beautiful sentiment of Plutarch, that \xe2\x80\x9cour souls have a\r\nnatural inclination to love, being born as much to love, as to feel, to\r\nreason, to understand and remember.\xe2\x80\x9d We talked of change and active\r\npursuits, but still remained at Windsor, incapable of violating the\r\ncharm that attached us to our secluded life.\r\n\r\nPareamo aver qui tutto il ben raccolto\r\nChe fra mortali in pi\xc3\xb9 parte si rimembra.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow also that our children gave us occupation, we found excuses for our\r\nidleness, in the idea of bringing them up to a more splendid career. At\r\nlength our tranquillity was disturbed, and the course of events, which\r\nfor five years had flowed on in hushing tranquillity, was broken by\r\nbreakers and obstacles, that woke us from our pleasant dream.\r\n\r\nA new Lord Protector of England was to be chosen; and, at Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequest, we removed to London, to witness, and even take a part in the\r\nelection. If Raymond had been united to Idris, this post had been his\r\nstepping-stone to higher dignity; and his desire for power and fame had\r\nbeen crowned with fullest measure. He had exchanged a sceptre for a\r\nlute, a kingdom for Perdita.\r\n\r\nDid he think of this as we journeyed up to town? I watched him, but\r\ncould make but little of him. He was particularly gay, playing with his\r\nchild, and turning to sport every word that was uttered. Perhaps he did\r\nthis because he saw a cloud upon Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s brow. She tried to rouse\r\nherself, but her eyes every now and then filled with tears, and she\r\nlooked wistfully on Raymond and her girl, as if fearful that some evil\r\nwould betide them. And so she felt. A presentiment of ill hung over\r\nher. She leaned from the window looking on the forest, and the turrets\r\nof the Castle, and as these became hid by intervening objects, she\r\npassionately exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cScenes of happiness! scenes sacred to devoted\r\nlove, when shall I see you again! and when I see ye, shall I be still\r\nthe beloved and joyous Perdita, or shall I, heart-broken and lost,\r\nwander among your groves, the ghost of what I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, silly one,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is your little head pondering\r\nupon, that of a sudden you have become so sublimely dismal? Cheer up,\r\nor I shall make you over to Idris, and call Adrian into the carriage,\r\nwho, I see by his gesture, sympathizes with my good spirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdrian was on horseback; he rode up to the carriage, and his gaiety, in\r\naddition to that of Raymond, dispelled my sister\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy. We\r\nentered London in the evening, and went to our several abodes near Hyde\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Lord Raymond visited me early. \xe2\x80\x9cI come to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9conly half assured that you will assist me in my project, but\r\nresolved to go through with it, whether you concur with me or not.\r\nPromise me secrecy however; for if you will not contribute to my\r\nsuccess, at least you must not baffle me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I promise. And now\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my dear fellow, for what are we come to London? To be present\r\nat the election of a Protector, and to give our yea or nay for his\r\nshuffling Grace of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94? or for that noisy Ryland? Do you believe, Verney,\r\nthat I brought you to town for that? No, we will have a Protector of\r\nour own. We will set up a candidate, and ensure his success. We will\r\nnominate Adrian, and do our best to bestow on him the power to which he\r\nis entitled by his birth, and which he merits through his virtues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not answer; I know all your objections, and will reply to them in\r\norder. First, Whether he will or will not consent to become a great\r\nman? Leave the task of persuasion on that point to me; I do not ask you\r\nto assist me there. Secondly, Whether he ought to exchange his\r\nemployment of plucking blackberries, and nursing wounded partridges in\r\nthe forest, for the command of a nation? My dear Lionel, we are married\r\nmen, and find employment sufficient in amusing our wives, and dancing\r\nour children. But Adrian is alone, wifeless, childless, unoccupied. I\r\nhave long observed him. He pines for want of some interest in life. His\r\nheart, exhausted by his early sufferings, reposes like a new-healed\r\nlimb, and shrinks from all excitement. But his understanding, his\r\ncharity, his virtues, want a field for exercise and display; and we\r\nwill procure it for him. Besides, is it not a shame, that the genius of\r\nAdrian should fade from the earth like a flower in an untrod\r\nmountain-path, fruitless? Do you think Nature composed his surpassing\r\nmachine for no purpose? Believe me, he was destined to be the author of\r\ninfinite good to his native England. Has she not bestowed on him every\r\ngift in prodigality?\xe2\x80\x94birth, wealth, talent, goodness? Does not every\r\none love and admire him? and does he not delight singly in such efforts\r\nas manifest his love to all? Come, I see that you are already\r\npersuaded, and will second me when I propose him to-night in\r\nparliament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have got up all your arguments in excellent order,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand, if Adrian consent, they are unanswerable. One only condition I\r\nwould make, \xe2\x80\x94that you do nothing without his concurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you are in the right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond; \xe2\x80\x9calthough I had thought\r\nat first to arrange the affair differently. Be it so. I will go\r\ninstantly to Adrian; and, if he inclines to consent, you will not\r\ndestroy my labour by persuading him to return, and turn squirrel again\r\nin Windsor Forest. Idris, you will not act the traitor towards me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, \xe2\x80\x9cI will preserve a strict neutrality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI am too well convinced of the worth of our\r\nfriend, and the rich harvest of benefits that all England would reap\r\nfrom his Protectorship, to deprive my countrymen of such a blessing, if\r\nhe consent to bestow it on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening Adrian visited us.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo you cabal also against me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cand will you make common cause with Raymond, in dragging\r\na poor visionary from the clouds to surround him with the fire-works\r\nand blasts of earthly grandeur, instead of heavenly rays and airs? I\r\nthought you knew me better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do know you better,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied \xe2\x80\x9cthan to think that you would be\r\nhappy in such a situation; but the good you would do to others may be\r\nan inducement, since the time is probably arrived when you can put your\r\ntheories into practice, and you may bring about such reformation and\r\nchange, as will conduce to that perfect system of government which you\r\ndelight to portray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak of an almost-forgotten dream,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, his countenance\r\nslightly clouding as he spoke; \xe2\x80\x9cthe visions of my boyhood have long\r\nsince faded in the light of reality; I know now that I am not a man\r\nfitted to govern nations; sufficient for me, if I keep in wholesome\r\nrule the little kingdom of my own mortality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do not you see, Lionel, the drift of our noble friend; a drift,\r\nperhaps, unknown to himself, but apparent to me. Lord Raymond was never\r\nborn to be a drone in the hive, and to find content in our pastoral\r\nlife. He thinks, that he ought to be satisfied; he imagines, that his\r\npresent situation precludes the possibility of aggrandisement; he does\r\nnot therefore, even in his own heart, plan change for himself. But do\r\nyou not see, that, under the idea of exalting me, he is chalking out a\r\nnew path for himself; a path of action from which he has long wandered?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us assist him. He, the noble, the warlike, the great in every\r\nquality that can adorn the mind and person of man; he is fitted to be\r\nthe Protector of England. If _I_\xe2\x80\x94that is, if _we_ propose him, he will\r\nassuredly be elected, and will find, in the functions of that high\r\noffice, scope for the towering powers of his mind. Even Perdita will\r\nrejoice. Perdita, in whom ambition was a covered fire until she married\r\nRaymond, which event was for a time the fulfilment of her hopes;\r\nPerdita will rejoice in the glory and advancement of her lord\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\ncoyly and prettily, not be discontented with her share. In the mean\r\ntime, we, the wise of the land, will return to our Castle, and,\r\nCincinnatus-like, take to our usual labours, until our friend shall\r\nrequire our presence and assistance here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe more Adrian reasoned upon this scheme, the more feasible it\r\nappeared. His own determination never to enter into public life was\r\ninsurmountable, and the delicacy of his health was a sufficient\r\nargument against it. The next step was to induce Raymond to confess his\r\nsecret wishes for dignity and fame. He entered while we were speaking.\r\nThe way in which Adrian had received his project for setting him up as\r\na candidate for the Protectorship, and his replies, had already\r\nawakened in his mind, the view of the subject which we were now\r\ndiscussing. His countenance and manner betrayed irresolution and\r\nanxiety; but the anxiety arose from a fear that we should not\r\nprosecute, or not succeed in our idea; and his irresolution, from a\r\ndoubt whether we should risk a defeat. A few words from us decided him,\r\nand hope and joy sparkled in his eyes; the idea of embarking in a\r\ncareer, so congenial to his early habits and cherished wishes, made him\r\nas before energetic and bold. We discussed his chances, the merits of\r\nthe other candidates, and the dispositions of the voters.\r\n\r\nAfter all we miscalculated. Raymond had lost much of his popularity,\r\nand was deserted by his peculiar partizans. Absence from the busy stage\r\nhad caused him to be forgotten by the people; his former parliamentary\r\nsupporters were principally composed of royalists, who had been willing\r\nto make an idol of him when he appeared as the heir of the Earldom of\r\nWindsor; but who were indifferent to him, when he came forward with no\r\nother attributes and distinctions than they conceived to be common to\r\nmany among themselves. Still he had many friends, admirers of his\r\ntranscendent talents; his presence in the house, his eloquence, address\r\nand imposing beauty, were calculated to produce an electric effect.\r\nAdrian also, notwithstanding his recluse habits and theories, so\r\nadverse to the spirit of party, had many friends, and they were easily\r\ninduced to vote for a candidate of his selection.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and Mr. Ryland, Lord Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s old antagonist, were the\r\nother candidates. The Duke was supported by all the aristocrats of the\r\nrepublic, who considered him their proper representative. Ryland was\r\nthe popular candidate; when Lord Raymond was first added to the list,\r\nhis chance of success appeared small. We retired from the debate which\r\nhad followed on his nomination: we, his nominators, mortified; he\r\ndispirited to excess. Perdita reproached us bitterly. Her expectations\r\nhad been strongly excited; she had urged nothing against our project,\r\non the contrary, she was evidently pleased by it; but its evident ill\r\nsuccess changed the current of her ideas. She felt, that, once\r\nawakened, Raymond would never return unrepining to Windsor. His habits\r\nwere unhinged; his restless mind roused from its sleep, ambition must\r\nnow be his companion through life; and if he did not succeed in his\r\npresent attempt, she foresaw that unhappiness and cureless discontent\r\nwould follow. Perhaps her own disappointment added a sting to her\r\nthoughts and words; she did not spare us, and our own reflections added\r\nto our disquietude.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to follow up our nomination, and to persuade Raymond\r\nto present himself to the electors on the following evening. For a long\r\ntime he was obstinate. He would embark in a balloon; he would sail for\r\na distant quarter of the world, where his name and humiliation were\r\nunknown. But this was useless; his attempt was registered; his purpose\r\npublished to the world; his shame could never be erased from the\r\nmemories of men. It was as well to fail at last after a struggle, as to\r\nfly now at the beginning of his enterprise.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that he adopted this idea, he was changed. His\r\ndepression and anxiety fled; he became all life and activity. The smile\r\nof triumph shone on his countenance; determined to pursue his object to\r\nthe uttermost, his manner and expression seem ominous of the\r\naccomplishment of his wishes. Not so Perdita. She was frightened by his\r\ngaiety, for she dreaded a greater revulsion at the end. If his\r\nappearance even inspired us with hope, it only rendered the state of\r\nher mind more painful. She feared to lose sight of him; yet she dreaded\r\nto remark any change in the temper of his mind. She listened eagerly to\r\nhim, yet tantalized herself by giving to his words a meaning foreign to\r\ntheir true interpretation, and adverse to her hopes. She dared not be\r\npresent at the contest; yet she remained at home a prey to double\r\nsolicitude. She wept over her little girl; she looked, she spoke, as if\r\nshe dreaded the occurrence of some frightful calamity. She was half mad\r\nfrom the effects of uncontrollable agitation.\r\n\r\nLord Raymond presented himself to the house with fearless confidence\r\nand insinuating address. After the Duke of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Ryland had finished\r\ntheir speeches, he commenced. Assuredly he had not conned his lesson;\r\nand at first he hesitated, pausing in his ideas, and in the choice of\r\nhis expressions. By degrees he warmed; his words flowed with ease, his\r\nlanguage was full of vigour, and his voice of persuasion. He reverted\r\nto his past life, his successes in Greece, his favour at home. Why\r\nshould he lose this, now that added years, prudence, and the pledge\r\nwhich his marriage gave to his country, ought to encrease, rather than\r\ndiminish his claims to confidence? He spoke of the state of England;\r\nthe necessary measures to be taken to ensure its security, and confirm\r\nits prosperity. He drew a glowing picture of its present situation. As\r\nhe spoke, every sound was hushed, every thought suspended by intense\r\nattention. His graceful elocution enchained the senses of his hearers.\r\nIn some degree also he was fitted to reconcile all parties. His birth\r\npleased the aristocracy; his being the candidate recommended by Adrian,\r\na man intimately allied to the popular party, caused a number, who had\r\nno great reliance either on the Duke or Mr. Ryland, to range on his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe contest was keen and doubtful. Neither Adrian nor myself would have\r\nbeen so anxious, if our own success had depended on our exertions; but\r\nwe had egged our friend on to the enterprise, and it became us to\r\nensure his triumph. Idris, who entertained the highest opinion of his\r\nabilities, was warmly interested in the event: and my poor sister, who\r\ndared not hope, and to whom fear was misery, was plunged into a fever\r\nof disquietude.\r\n\r\nDay after day passed while we discussed our projects for the evening,\r\nand each night was occupied by debates which offered no conclusion. At\r\nlast the crisis came: the night when parliament, which had so long\r\ndelayed its choice, must decide: as the hour of twelve passed, and the\r\nnew day began, it was by virtue of the constitution dissolved, its\r\npower extinct.\r\n\r\nWe assembled at Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s house, we and our partizans. At half past\r\nfive o\xe2\x80\x99clock we proceeded to the House. Idris endeavoured to calm\r\nPerdita; but the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s agitation deprived her of all power of\r\nself-command. She walked up and down the room,\xe2\x80\x94gazed wildly when any\r\none entered, fancying that they might be the announcers of her doom. I\r\nmust do justice to my sweet sister: it was not for herself that she was\r\nthus agonized. She alone knew the weight which Raymond attached to his\r\nsuccess. Even to us he assumed gaiety and hope, and assumed them so\r\nwell, that we did not divine the secret workings of his mind. Sometimes\r\na nervous trembling, a sharp dissonance of voice, and momentary fits of\r\nabsence revealed to Perdita the violence he did himself; but we, intent\r\non our plans, observed only his ready laugh, his joke intruded on all\r\noccasions, the flow of his spirits which seemed incapable of ebb.\r\nBesides, Perdita was with him in his retirement; she saw the moodiness\r\nthat succeeded to this forced hilarity; she marked his disturbed sleep,\r\nhis painful irritability\xe2\x80\x94once she had seen his tears\xe2\x80\x94hers had scarce\r\nceased to flow, since she had beheld the big drops which disappointed\r\npride had caused to gather in his eye, but which pride was unable to\r\ndispel. What wonder then, that her feelings were wrought to this pitch!\r\nI thus accounted to myself for her agitation; but this was not all, and\r\nthe sequel revealed another excuse.\r\n\r\nOne moment we seized before our departure, to take leave of our beloved\r\ngirls. I had small hope of success, and entreated Idris to watch over\r\nmy sister. As I approached the latter, she seized my hand, and drew me\r\ninto another apartment; she threw herself into my arms, and wept and\r\nsobbed bitterly and long. I tried to soothe her; I bade her hope; I\r\nasked what tremendous consequences would ensue even on our failure. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nbrother,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cprotector of my childhood, dear, most dear\r\nLionel, my fate hangs by a thread. I have you all about me now\xe2\x80\x94you, the\r\ncompanion of my infancy; Adrian, as dear to me as if bound by the ties\r\nof blood; Idris, the sister of my heart, and her lovely offspring.\r\nThis, O this may be the last time that you will surround me thus!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbruptly she stopped, and then cried: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I said?\xe2\x80\x94foolish false\r\ngirl that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked wildly on me, and then suddenly calming\r\nherself, apologized for what she called her unmeaning words, saying\r\nthat she must indeed be insane, for, while Raymond lived, she must be\r\nhappy; and then, though she still wept, she suffered me tranquilly to\r\ndepart. Raymond only took her hand when he went, and looked on her\r\nexpressively; she answered by a look of intelligence and assent.\r\n\r\nPoor girl! what she then suffered! I could never entirely forgive\r\nRaymond for the trials he imposed on her, occasioned as they were by a\r\nselfish feeling on his part. He had schemed, if he failed in his\r\npresent attempt, without taking leave of any of us, to embark for\r\nGreece, and never again to revisit England. Perdita acceded to his\r\nwishes; for his contentment was the chief object of her life, the crown\r\nof her enjoyment; but to leave us all, her companions, the beloved\r\npartners of her happiest years, and in the interim to conceal this\r\nfrightful determination, was a task that almost conquered her strength\r\nof mind. She had been employed in arranging for their departure; she\r\nhad promised Raymond during this decisive evening, to take advantage of\r\nour absence, to go one stage of the journey, and he, after his defeat\r\nwas ascertained, would slip away from us, and join her.\r\n\r\nAlthough, when I was informed of this scheme, I was bitterly offended\r\nby the small attention which Raymond paid to my sister\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, I\r\nwas led by reflection to consider, that he acted under the force of\r\nsuch strong excitement, as to take from him the consciousness, and,\r\nconsequently, the guilt of a fault. If he had permitted us to witness\r\nhis agitation, he would have been more under the guidance of reason;\r\nbut his struggles for the shew of composure, acted with such violence\r\non his nerves, as to destroy his power of self-command. I am convinced\r\nthat, at the worst, he would have returned from the seashore to take\r\nleave of us, and to make us the partners of his council. But the task\r\nimposed on Perdita was not the less painful. He had extorted from her a\r\nvow of secrecy; and her part of the drama, since it was to be performed\r\nalone, was the most agonizing that could be devised. But to return to\r\nmy narrative.\r\n\r\nThe debates had hitherto been long and loud; they had often been\r\nprotracted merely for the sake of delay. But now each seemed fearful\r\nlest the fatal moment should pass, while the choice was yet undecided.\r\nUnwonted silence reigned in the house, the members spoke in whispers,\r\nand the ordinary business was transacted with celerity and quietness.\r\nDuring the first stage of the election, the Duke of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94had been thrown\r\nout; the question therefore lay between Lord Raymond and Mr. Ryland.\r\nThe latter had felt secure of victory, until the appearance of Raymond;\r\nand, since his name had been inserted as a candidate, he had canvassed\r\nwith eagerness. He had appeared each evening, impatience and anger\r\nmarked in his looks, scowling on us from the opposite side of St.\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s, as if his mere frown would cast eclipse on our hopes.\r\n\r\nEvery thing in the English constitution had been regulated for the\r\nbetter preservation of peace. On the last day, two candidates only were\r\nallowed to remain; and to obviate, if possible, the last struggle\r\nbetween these, a bribe was offered to him who should voluntarily resign\r\nhis pretensions; a place of great emolument and honour was given him,\r\nand his success facilitated at a future election. Strange to say\r\nhowever, no instance had yet occurred, where either candidate had had\r\nrecourse to this expedient; in consequence the law had become obsolete,\r\nnor had been referred to by any of us in our discussions. To our\r\nextreme surprise, when it was moved that we should resolve ourselves\r\ninto a committee for the election of the Lord Protector, the member who\r\nhad nominated Ryland, rose and informed us that this candidate had\r\nresigned his pretensions. His information was at first received with\r\nsilence; a confused murmur succeeded; and, when the chairman declared\r\nLord Raymond duly chosen, it amounted to a shout of applause and\r\nvictory. It seemed as if, far from any dread of defeat even if Mr.\r\nRyland had not resigned, every voice would have been united in favour\r\nof our candidate. In fact, now that the idea of contest was dismissed,\r\nall hearts returned to their former respect and admiration of our\r\naccomplished friend. Each felt, that England had never seen a Protector\r\nso capable of fulfilling the arduous duties of that high office. One\r\nvoice made of many voices, resounded through the chamber; it syllabled\r\nthe name of Raymond.\r\n\r\nHe entered. I was on one of the highest seats, and saw him walk up the\r\npassage to the table of the speaker. The native modesty of his\r\ndisposition conquered the joy of his triumph. He looked round timidly;\r\na mist seemed before his eyes. Adrian, who was beside me, hastened to\r\nhim, and jumping down the benches, was at his side in a moment. His\r\nappearance re-animated our friend; and, when he came to speak and act,\r\nhis hesitation vanished, and he shone out supreme in majesty and\r\nvictory. The former Protector tendered him the oaths, and presented him\r\nwith the insignia of office, performing the ceremonies of installation.\r\nThe house then dissolved. The chief members of the state crowded round\r\nthe new magistrate, and conducted him to the palace of government.\r\nAdrian suddenly vanished; and, by the time that Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s supporters\r\nwere reduced to our intimate friends merely, returned leading Idris to\r\ncongratulate her friend on his success.\r\n\r\nBut where was Perdita? In securing solicitously an unobserved retreat\r\nin case of failure, Raymond had forgotten to arrange the mode by which\r\nshe was to hear of his success; and she had been too much agitated to\r\nrevert to this circumstance. When Idris entered, so far had Raymond\r\nforgotten himself, that he asked for my sister; one word, which told of\r\nher mysterious disappearance, recalled him. Adrian it is true had\r\nalready gone to seek the fugitive, imagining that her tameless anxiety\r\nhad led her to the purlieus of the House, and that some sinister event\r\ndetained her. But Raymond, without explaining himself, suddenly quitted\r\nus, and in another moment we heard him gallop down the street, in spite\r\nof the wind and rain that scattered tempest over the earth. We did not\r\nknow how far he had to go, and soon separated, supposing that in a\r\nshort time he would return to the palace with Perdita, and that they\r\nwould not be sorry to find themselves alone.\r\n\r\nPerdita had arrived with her child at Dartford, weeping and\r\ninconsolable. She directed everything to be prepared for the\r\ncontinuance of their journey, and placing her lovely sleeping charge on\r\na bed, passed several hours in acute suffering. Sometimes she observed\r\nthe war of elements, thinking that they also declared against her, and\r\nlistened to the pattering of the rain in gloomy despair. Sometimes she\r\nhung over her child, tracing her resemblance to the father, and fearful\r\nlest in after life she should display the same passions and\r\nuncontrollable impulses, that rendered him unhappy. Again, with a gush\r\nof pride and delight, she marked in the features of her little girl,\r\nthe same smile of beauty that often irradiated Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s countenance.\r\nThe sight of it soothed her. She thought of the treasure she possessed\r\nin the affections of her lord; of his accomplishments, surpassing those\r\nof his contemporaries, his genius, his devotion to her.\xe2\x80\x94Soon she\r\nthought, that all she possessed in the world, except him, might well be\r\nspared, nay, given with delight, a propitiatory offering, to secure the\r\nsupreme good she retained in him. Soon she imagined, that fate demanded\r\nthis sacrifice from her, as a mark she was devoted to Raymond, and that\r\nit must be made with cheerfulness. She figured to herself their life in\r\nthe Greek isle he had selected for their retreat; her task of soothing\r\nhim; her cares for the beauteous Clara, her rides in his company, her\r\ndedication of herself to his consolation. The picture then presented\r\nitself to her in such glowing colours, that she feared the reverse, and\r\na life of magnificence and power in London; where Raymond would no\r\nlonger be hers only, nor she the sole source of happiness to him. So\r\nfar as she merely was concerned, she began to hope for defeat; and it\r\nwas only on his account that her feelings vacillated, as she heard him\r\ngallop into the court-yard of the inn. That he should come to her\r\nalone, wetted by the storm, careless of every thing except speed, what\r\nelse could it mean, than that, vanquished and solitary, they were to\r\ntake their way from native England, the scene of shame, and hide\r\nthemselves in the myrtle groves of the Grecian isles?\r\n\r\nIn a moment she was in his arms. The knowledge of his success had\r\nbecome so much a part of himself, that he forgot that it was necessary\r\nto impart it to his companion. She only felt in his embrace a dear\r\nassurance that while he possessed her, he would not despair. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nkind,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is noble, my own beloved! O fear not disgrace\r\nor lowly fortune, while you have your Perdita; fear not sorrow, while\r\nour child lives and smiles. Let us go even where you will; the love\r\nthat accompanies us will prevent our regrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLocked in his embrace, she spoke thus, and cast back her head, seeking\r\nan assent to her words in his eyes\xe2\x80\x94they were sparkling with ineffable\r\ndelight. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my little Lady Protectress,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, playfully, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nis this you say? And what pretty scheme have you woven of exile and\r\nobscurity, while a brighter web, a gold-enwoven tissue, is that which,\r\nin truth, you ought to contemplate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her brow\xe2\x80\x94but the wayward girl, half sorry at his triumph,\r\nagitated by swift change of thought, hid her face in his bosom and\r\nwept. He comforted her; he instilled into her his own hopes and\r\ndesires; and soon her countenance beamed with sympathy. How very happy\r\nwere they that night! How full even to bursting was their sense of joy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving seen our friend properly installed in his new office, we turned\r\nour eyes towards Windsor. The nearness of this place to London was\r\nsuch, as to take away the idea of painful separation, when we quitted\r\nRaymond and Perdita. We took leave of them in the Protectoral Palace.\r\nIt was pretty enough to see my sister enter as it were into the spirit\r\nof the drama, and endeavour to fill her station with becoming dignity.\r\nHer internal pride and humility of manner were now more than ever at\r\nwar. Her timidity was not artificial, but arose from that fear of not\r\nbeing properly appreciated, that slight estimation of the neglect of\r\nthe world, which also characterized Raymond. But then Perdita thought\r\nmore constantly of others than he; and part of her bashfulness arose\r\nfrom a wish to take from those around her a sense of inferiority; a\r\nfeeling which never crossed her mind. From the circumstances of her\r\nbirth and education, Idris would have been better fitted for the\r\nformulae of ceremony; but the very ease which accompanied such actions\r\nwith her, arising from habit, rendered them tedious; while, with every\r\ndrawback, Perdita evidently enjoyed her situation. She was too full of\r\nnew ideas to feel much pain when we departed; she took an affectionate\r\nleave of us, and promised to visit us soon; but she did not regret the\r\ncircumstances that caused our separation. The spirits of Raymond were\r\nunbounded; he did not know what to do with his new got power; his head\r\nwas full of plans; he had as yet decided on none\xe2\x80\x94 but he promised\r\nhimself, his friends, and the world, that the aera of his Protectorship\r\nshould be signalized by some act of surpassing glory. Thus, we talked\r\nof them, and moralized, as with diminished numbers we returned to\r\nWindsor Castle. We felt extreme delight at our escape from political\r\nturmoil, and sought our solitude with redoubled zest. We did not want\r\nfor occupation; but my eager disposition was now turned to the field of\r\nintellectual exertion only; and hard study I found to be an excellent\r\nmedicine to allay a fever of spirit with which in indolence, I should\r\ndoubtless have been assailed. Perdita had permitted us to take Clara\r\nback with us to Windsor; and she and my two lovely infants were\r\nperpetual sources of interest and amusement.\r\n\r\nThe only circumstance that disturbed our peace, was the health of\r\nAdrian. It evidently declined, without any symptom which could lead us\r\nto suspect his disease, unless indeed his brightened eyes, animated\r\nlook, and flustering cheeks, made us dread consumption; but he was\r\nwithout pain or fear. He betook himself to books with ardour, and\r\nreposed from study in the society he best loved, that of his sister and\r\nmyself. Sometimes he went up to London to visit Raymond, and watch the\r\nprogress of events. Clara often accompanied him in these excursions;\r\npartly that she might see her parents, partly because Adrian delighted\r\nin the prattle, and intelligent looks of this lovely child.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all went on well in London. The new elections were finished;\r\nparliament met, and Raymond was occupied in a thousand beneficial\r\nschemes. Canals, aqueducts, bridges, stately buildings, and various\r\nedifices for public utility, were entered upon; he was continually\r\nsurrounded by projectors and projects, which were to render England one\r\nscene of fertility and magnificence; the state of poverty was to be\r\nabolished; men were to be transported from place to place almost with\r\nthe same facility as the Princes Houssain, Ali, and Ahmed, in the\r\nArabian Nights. The physical state of man would soon not yield to the\r\nbeatitude of angels; disease was to be banished; labour lightened of\r\nits heaviest burden. Nor did this seem extravagant. The arts of life,\r\nand the discoveries of science had augmented in a ratio which left all\r\ncalculation behind; food sprung up, so to say, spontaneously\xe2\x80\x94machines\r\nexisted to supply with facility every want of the population. An evil\r\ndirection still survived; and men were not happy, not because they\r\ncould not, but because they would not rouse themselves to vanquish\r\nself-raised obstacles. Raymond was to inspire them with his beneficial\r\nwill, and the mechanism of society, once systematised according to\r\nfaultless rules, would never again swerve into disorder. For these\r\nhopes he abandoned his long-cherished ambition of being enregistered in\r\nthe annals of nations as a successful warrior; laying aside his sword,\r\npeace and its enduring glories became his aim\xe2\x80\x94the title he coveted was\r\nthat of the benefactor of his country.\r\n\r\nAmong other works of art in which he was engaged, he had projected the\r\nerection of a national gallery for statues and pictures. He possessed\r\nmany himself, which he designed to present to the Republic; and, as the\r\nedifice was to be the great ornament of his Protectorship, he was very\r\nfastidious in his choice of the plan on which it would be built.\r\nHundreds were brought to him and rejected. He sent even to Italy and\r\nGreece for drawings; but, as the design was to be characterized by\r\noriginality as well as by perfect beauty, his endeavours were for a\r\ntime without avail. At length a drawing came, with an address where\r\ncommunications might be sent, and no artist\xe2\x80\x99s name affixed. The design\r\nwas new and elegant, but faulty; so faulty, that although drawn with\r\nthe hand and eye of taste, it was evidently the work of one who was not\r\nan architect. Raymond contemplated it with delight; the more he gazed,\r\nthe more pleased he was; and yet the errors multiplied under\r\ninspection. He wrote to the address given, desiring to see the\r\ndraughtsman, that such alterations might be made, as should be\r\nsuggested in a consultation between him and the original conceiver.\r\n\r\nA Greek came. A middle-aged man, with some intelligence of manner, but\r\nwith so common-place a physiognomy, that Raymond could scarcely believe\r\nthat he was the designer. He acknowledged that he was not an architect;\r\nbut the idea of the building had struck him, though he had sent it\r\nwithout the smallest hope of its being accepted. He was a man of few\r\nwords. Raymond questioned him; but his reserved answers soon made him\r\nturn from the man to the drawing. He pointed out the errors, and the\r\nalterations that he wished to be made; he offered the Greek a pencil\r\nthat he might correct the sketch on the spot; this was refused by his\r\nvisitor, who said that he perfectly understood, and would work at it at\r\nhome. At length Raymond suffered him to depart.\r\n\r\nThe next day he returned. The design had been re-drawn; but many\r\ndefects still remained, and several of the instructions given had been\r\nmisunderstood. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cI yielded to you yesterday, now\r\ncomply with my request\xe2\x80\x94take the pencil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Greek took it, but he handled it in no artist-like way; at length\r\nhe said: \xe2\x80\x9cI must confess to you, my Lord, that I did not make this\r\ndrawing. It is impossible for you to see the real designer; your\r\ninstructions must pass through me. Condescend therefore to have\r\npatience with my ignorance, and to explain your wishes to me; in time I\r\nam certain that you will be satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaymond questioned vainly; the mysterious Greek would say no more.\r\nWould an architect be permitted to see the artist? This also was\r\nrefused. Raymond repeated his instructions, and the visitor retired.\r\nOur friend resolved however not to be foiled in his wish. He suspected,\r\nthat unaccustomed poverty was the cause of the mystery, and that the\r\nartist was unwilling to be seen in the garb and abode of want. Raymond\r\nwas only the more excited by this consideration to discover him;\r\nimpelled by the interest he took in obscure talent, he therefore\r\nordered a person skilled in such matters, to follow the Greek the next\r\ntime he came, and observe the house in which he should enter. His\r\nemissary obeyed, and brought the desired intelligence. He had traced\r\nthe man to one of the most penurious streets in the metropolis. Raymond\r\ndid not wonder, that, thus situated, the artist had shrunk from notice,\r\nbut he did not for this alter his resolve.\r\n\r\nOn the same evening, he went alone to the house named to him. Poverty,\r\ndirt, and squalid misery characterized its appearance. Alas! thought\r\nRaymond, I have much to do before England becomes a Paradise. He\r\nknocked; the door was opened by a string from above\xe2\x80\x94the broken,\r\nwretched staircase was immediately before him, but no person appeared;\r\nhe knocked again, vainly\xe2\x80\x94and then, impatient of further delay, he\r\nascended the dark, creaking stairs. His main wish, more particularly\r\nnow that he witnessed the abject dwelling of the artist, was to relieve\r\none, possessed of talent, but depressed by want. He pictured to himself\r\na youth, whose eyes sparkled with genius, whose person was attenuated\r\nby famine. He half feared to displease him; but he trusted that his\r\ngenerous kindness would be administered so delicately, as not to excite\r\nrepulse. What human heart is shut to kindness? and though poverty, in\r\nits excess, might render the sufferer unapt to submit to the supposed\r\ndegradation of a benefit, the zeal of the benefactor must at last relax\r\nhim into thankfulness. These thoughts encouraged Raymond, as he stood\r\nat the door of the highest room of the house. After trying vainly to\r\nenter the other apartments, he perceived just within the threshold of\r\nthis one, a pair of small Turkish slippers; the door was ajar, but all\r\nwas silent within. It was probable that the inmate was absent, but\r\nsecure that he had found the right person, our adventurous Protector\r\nwas tempted to enter, to leave a purse on the table, and silently\r\ndepart. In pursuance of this idea, he pushed open the door gently\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthe room was inhabited.\r\n\r\nRaymond had never visited the dwellings of want, and the scene that now\r\npresented itself struck him to the heart. The floor was sunk in many\r\nplaces; the walls ragged and bare\xe2\x80\x94the ceiling weather-stained\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ntattered bed stood in the corner; there were but two chairs in the\r\nroom, and a rough broken table, on which was a light in a tin\r\ncandlestick;\xe2\x80\x94yet in the midst of such drear and heart sickening\r\npoverty, there was an air of order and cleanliness that surprised him.\r\nThe thought was fleeting; for his attention was instantly drawn towards\r\nthe inhabitant of this wretched abode. It was a female. She sat at the\r\ntable; one small hand shaded her eyes from the candle; the other held a\r\npencil; her looks were fixed on a drawing before her, which Raymond\r\nrecognized as the design presented to him. Her whole appearance\r\nawakened his deepest interest. Her dark hair was braided and twined in\r\nthick knots like the head-dress of a Grecian statue; her garb was mean,\r\nbut her attitude might have been selected as a model of grace. Raymond\r\nhad a confused remembrance that he had seen such a form before; he\r\nwalked across the room; she did not raise her eyes, merely asking in\r\nRomaic, who is there? \xe2\x80\x9cA friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Raymond in the same dialect.\r\nShe looked up wondering, and he saw that it was Evadne Zaimi. Evadne,\r\nonce the idol of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s affections; and who, for the sake of her\r\npresent visitor, had disdained the noble youth, and then, neglected by\r\nhim she loved, with crushed hopes and a stinging sense of misery, had\r\nreturned to her native Greece. What revolution of fortune could have\r\nbrought her to England, and housed her thus?\r\n\r\nRaymond recognized her; and his manner changed from polite beneficence\r\nto the warmest protestations of kindness and sympathy. The sight of\r\nher, in her present situation, passed like an arrow into his soul. He\r\nsat by her, he took her hand, and said a thousand things which breathed\r\nthe deepest spirit of compassion and affection. Evadne did not answer;\r\nher large dark eyes were cast down, at length a tear glimmered on the\r\nlashes. \xe2\x80\x9cThus,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9ckindness can do, what no want, no misery\r\never effected; I weep.\xe2\x80\x9d She shed indeed many tears; her head sunk\r\nunconsciously on the shoulder of Raymond; he held her hand: he kissed\r\nher sunken tear-stained cheek. He told her, that her sufferings were\r\nnow over: no one possessed the art of consoling like Raymond; he did\r\nnot reason or declaim, but his look shone with sympathy; he brought\r\npleasant images before the sufferer; his caresses excited no distrust,\r\nfor they arose purely from the feeling which leads a mother to kiss her\r\nwounded child; a desire to demonstrate in every possible way the truth\r\nof his feelings, and the keenness of his wish to pour balm into the\r\nlacerated mind of the unfortunate. As Evadne regained her composure,\r\nhis manner became even gay; he sported with the idea of her poverty.\r\nSomething told him that it was not its real evils that lay heavily at\r\nher heart, but the debasement and disgrace attendant on it; as he\r\ntalked, he divested it of these; sometimes speaking of her fortitude\r\nwith energetic praise; then, alluding to her past state, he called her\r\nhis Princess in disguise. He made her warm offers of service; she was\r\ntoo much occupied by more engrossing thoughts, either to accept or\r\nreject them; at length he left her, making a promise to repeat his\r\nvisit the next day. He returned home, full of mingled feelings, of pain\r\nexcited by Evadne\xe2\x80\x99s wretchedness, and pleasure at the prospect of\r\nrelieving it. Some motive for which he did not account, even to\r\nhimself, prevented him from relating his adventure to Perdita.\r\n\r\nThe next day he threw such disguise over his person as a cloak\r\nafforded, and revisited Evadne. As he went, he bought a basket of\r\ncostly fruits, such as were natives of her own country, and throwing\r\nover these various beautiful flowers, bore it himself to the miserable\r\ngarret of his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cBehold,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, as he entered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat bird\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfood I have brought for my sparrow on the house-top.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvadne now related the tale of her misfortunes. Her father, though of\r\nhigh rank, had in the end dissipated his fortune, and even destroyed\r\nhis reputation and influence through a course of dissolute indulgence.\r\nHis health was impaired beyond hope of cure; and it became his earnest\r\nwish, before he died, to preserve his daughter from the poverty which\r\nwould be the portion of her orphan state. He therefore accepted for\r\nher, and persuaded her to accede to, a proposal of marriage, from a\r\nwealthy Greek merchant settled at Constantinople. She quitted her\r\nnative Greece; her father died; by degrees she was cut off from all the\r\ncompanions and ties of her youth.\r\n\r\nThe war, which about a year before the present time had broken out\r\nbetween Greece and Turkey, brought about many reverses of fortune. Her\r\nhusband became bankrupt, and then in a tumult and threatened massacre\r\non the part of the Turks, they were obliged to fly at midnight, and\r\nreached in an open boat an English vessel under sail, which brought\r\nthem immediately to this island. The few jewels they had saved,\r\nsupported them awhile. The whole strength of Evadne\xe2\x80\x99s mind was exerted\r\nto support the failing spirits of her husband. Loss of property,\r\nhopelessness as to his future prospects, the inoccupation to which\r\npoverty condemned him, combined to reduce him to a state bordering on\r\ninsanity. Five months after their arrival in England, he committed\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Evadne, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I have done since; why I\r\nhave not applied for succour to the rich Greeks resident here; why I\r\nhave not returned to my native country? My answer to these questions\r\nmust needs appear to you unsatisfactory, yet they have sufficed to lead\r\nme on, day after day, enduring every wretchedness, rather than by such\r\nmeans to seek relief. Shall the daughter of the noble, though prodigal\r\nZaimi, appear a beggar before her compeers or inferiors\xe2\x80\x94superiors she\r\nhad none. Shall I bow my head before them, and with servile gesture\r\nsell my nobility for life? Had I a child, or any tie to bind me to\r\nexistence, I might descend to this\xe2\x80\x94but, as it is\xe2\x80\x94the world has been to\r\nme a harsh step-mother; fain would I leave the abode she seems to\r\ngrudge, and in the grave forget my pride, my struggles, my despair. The\r\ntime will soon come; grief and famine have already sapped the\r\nfoundations of my being; a very short time, and I shall have passed\r\naway; unstained by the crime of self-destruction, unstung by the memory\r\nof degradation, my spirit will throw aside the miserable coil, and find\r\nsuch recompense as fortitude and resignation may deserve. This may seem\r\nmadness to you, yet you also have pride and resolution; do not then\r\nwonder that my pride is tameless, my resolution unalterable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving thus finished her tale, and given such an account as she deemed\r\nfit, of the motives of her abstaining from all endeavour to obtain aid\r\nfrom her countrymen, Evadne paused; yet she seemed to have more to say,\r\nto which she was unable to give words. In the mean time Raymond was\r\neloquent. His desire of restoring his lovely friend to her rank in\r\nsociety, and to her lost prosperity, animated him, and he poured forth\r\nwith energy, all his wishes and intentions on that subject. But he was\r\nchecked; Evadne exacted a promise, that he should conceal from all her\r\nfriends her existence in England. \xe2\x80\x9cThe relatives of the Earl of\r\nWindsor,\xe2\x80\x9d said she haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cdoubtless think that I injured him;\r\nperhaps the Earl himself would be the first to acquit me, but probably\r\nI do not deserve acquittal. I acted then, as I ever must, from impulse.\r\nThis abode of penury may at least prove the disinterestedness of my\r\nconduct. No matter: I do not wish to plead my cause before any of them,\r\nnot even before your Lordship, had you not first discovered me. The\r\ntenor of my actions will prove that I had rather die, than be a mark\r\nfor scorn\xe2\x80\x94behold the proud Evadne in her tatters! look on the\r\nbeggar-princess! There is aspic venom in the thought\xe2\x80\x94promise me that my\r\nsecret shall not be violated by you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaymond promised; but then a new discussion ensued. Evadne required\r\nanother engagement on his part, that he would not without her\r\nconcurrence enter into any project for her benefit, nor himself offer\r\nrelief. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not degrade me in my own eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cpoverty has long\r\nbeen my nurse; hard-visaged she is, but honest. If dishonour, or what I\r\nconceive to be dishonour, come near me, I am lost.\xe2\x80\x9d Raymond adduced\r\nmany arguments and fervent persuasions to overcome her feeling, but she\r\nremained unconvinced; and, agitated by the discussion, she wildly and\r\npassionately made a solemn vow, to fly and hide herself where he never\r\ncould discover her, where famine would soon bring death to conclude her\r\nwoes, if he persisted in his to her disgracing offers. She could\r\nsupport herself, she said. And then she shewed him how, by executing\r\nvarious designs and paintings, she earned a pittance for her support.\r\nRaymond yielded for the present. He felt assured, after he had for\r\nawhile humoured her self-will, that in the end friendship and reason\r\nwould gain the day.\r\n\r\nBut the feelings that actuated Evadne were rooted in the depths of her\r\nbeing, and were such in their growth as he had no means of\r\nunderstanding. Evadne loved Raymond. He was the hero of her\r\nimagination, the image carved by love in the unchanged texture of her\r\nheart. Seven years ago, in her youthful prime, she had become attached\r\nto him; he had served her country against the Turks; he had in her own\r\nland acquired that military glory peculiarly dear to the Greeks, since\r\nthey were still obliged inch by inch to fight for their security. Yet\r\nwhen he returned thence, and first appeared in public life in England,\r\nher love did not purchase his, which then vacillated between Perdita\r\nand a crown. While he was yet undecided, she had quitted England; the\r\nnews of his marriage reached her, and her hopes, poorly nurtured\r\nblossoms, withered and fell. The glory of life was gone for her; the\r\nroseate halo of love, which had imbued every object with its own\r\ncolour, faded;\xe2\x80\x94she was content to take life as it was, and to make the\r\nbest of leaden-coloured reality. She married; and, carrying her\r\nrestless energy of character with her into new scenes, she turned her\r\nthoughts to ambition, and aimed at the title and power of Princess of\r\nWallachia; while her patriotic feelings were soothed by the idea of the\r\ngood she might do her country, when her husband should be chief of this\r\nprincipality. She lived to find ambition, as unreal a delusion as love.\r\nHer intrigues with Russia for the furtherance of her object, excited\r\nthe jealousy of the Porte, and the animosity of the Greek government.\r\nShe was considered a traitor by both, the ruin of her husband followed;\r\nthey avoided death by a timely flight, and she fell from the height of\r\nher desires to penury in England. Much of this tale she concealed from\r\nRaymond; nor did she confess, that repulse and denial, as to a criminal\r\nconvicted of the worst of crimes, that of bringing the scythe of\r\nforeign despotism to cut away the new springing liberties of her\r\ncountry, would have followed her application to any among the Greeks.\r\n\r\nShe knew that she was the cause of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s utter ruin; and she\r\nstrung herself to bear the consequences. The reproaches which agony\r\nextorted; or worse, cureless, uncomplaining depression, when his mind\r\nwas sunk in a torpor, not the less painful because it was silent and\r\nmoveless. She reproached herself with the crime of his death; guilt and\r\nits punishments appeared to surround her; in vain she endeavoured to\r\nallay remorse by the memory of her real integrity; the rest of the\r\nworld, and she among them, judged of her actions, by their\r\nconsequences. She prayed for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s soul; she conjured the\r\nSupreme to place on her head the crime of his self-destruction\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nvowed to live to expiate his fault.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such wretchedness as must soon have destroyed her, one\r\nthought only was matter of consolation. She lived in the same country,\r\nbreathed the same air as Raymond. His name as Protector was the burthen\r\nof every tongue; his achievements, projects, and magnificence, the\r\nargument of every story. Nothing is so precious to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart as\r\nthe glory and excellence of him she loves; thus in every horror Evadne\r\nrevelled in his fame and prosperity. While her husband lived, this\r\nfeeling was regarded by her as a crime, repressed, repented of. When he\r\ndied, the tide of love resumed its ancient flow, it deluged her soul\r\nwith its tumultuous waves, and she gave herself up a prey to its\r\nuncontrollable power.\r\n\r\nBut never, O, never, should he see her in her degraded state. Never\r\nshould he behold her fallen, as she deemed, from her pride of beauty,\r\nthe poverty-stricken inhabitant of a garret, with a name which had\r\nbecome a reproach, and a weight of guilt on her soul. But though\r\nimpenetrably veiled from him, his public office permitted her to become\r\nacquainted with all his actions, his daily course of life, even his\r\nconversation. She allowed herself one luxury, she saw the newspapers\r\nevery day, and feasted on the praise and actions of the Protector. Not\r\nthat this indulgence was devoid of accompanying grief. Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nwas for ever joined with his; their conjugal felicity was celebrated\r\neven by the authentic testimony of facts. They were continually\r\ntogether, nor could the unfortunate Evadne read the monosyllable that\r\ndesignated his name, without, at the same time, being presented with\r\nthe image of her who was the faithful companion of all his labours and\r\npleasures. _They_, _their Excellencies_, met her eyes in each line,\r\nmingling an evil potion that poisoned her very blood.\r\n\r\nIt was in the newspaper that she saw the advertisement for the design\r\nfor a national gallery. Combining with taste her remembrance of the\r\nedifices which she had seen in the east, and by an effort of genius\r\nenduing them with unity of design, she executed the plan which had been\r\nsent to the Protector. She triumphed in the idea of bestowing, unknown\r\nand forgotten as she was, a benefit upon him she loved; and with\r\nenthusiastic pride looked forward to the accomplishment of a work of\r\nhers, which, immortalized in stone, would go down to posterity stamped\r\nwith the name of Raymond. She awaited with eagerness the return of her\r\nmessenger from the palace; she listened insatiate to his account of\r\neach word, each look of the Protector; she felt bliss in this\r\ncommunication with her beloved, although he knew not to whom he\r\naddressed his instructions. The drawing itself became ineffably dear to\r\nher. He had seen it, and praised it; it was again retouched by her,\r\neach stroke of her pencil was as a chord of thrilling music, and bore\r\nto her the idea of a temple raised to celebrate the deepest and most\r\nunutterable emotions of her soul. These contemplations engaged her,\r\nwhen the voice of Raymond first struck her ear, a voice, once heard,\r\nnever to be forgotten; she mastered her gush of feelings, and welcomed\r\nhim with quiet gentleness.\r\n\r\nPride and tenderness now struggled, and at length made a compromise\r\ntogether. She would see Raymond, since destiny had led him to her, and\r\nher constancy and devotion must merit his friendship. But her rights\r\nwith regard to him, and her cherished independence, should not be\r\ninjured by the idea of interest, or the intervention of the complicated\r\nfeelings attendant on pecuniary obligation, and the relative situations\r\nof the benefactor, and benefited. Her mind was of uncommon strength;\r\nshe could subdue her sensible wants to her mental wishes, and suffer\r\ncold, hunger and misery, rather than concede to fortune a contested\r\npoint. Alas! that in human nature such a pitch of mental discipline,\r\nand disdainful negligence of nature itself, should not have been allied\r\nto the extreme of moral excellence! But the resolution that permitted\r\nher to resist the pains of privation, sprung from the too great energy\r\nof her passions; and the concentrated self-will of which this was a\r\nsign, was destined to destroy even the very idol, to preserve whose\r\nrespect she submitted to this detail of wretchedness.\r\n\r\nTheir intercourse continued. By degrees Evadne related to her friend\r\nthe whole of her story, the stain her name had received in Greece, the\r\nweight of sin which had accrued to her from the death of her husband.\r\nWhen Raymond offered to clear her reputation, and demonstrate to the\r\nworld her real patriotism, she declared that it was only through her\r\npresent sufferings that she hoped for any relief to the stings of\r\nconscience; that, in her state of mind, diseased as he might think it,\r\nthe necessity of occupation was salutary medicine; she ended by\r\nextorting a promise that for the space of one month he would refrain\r\nfrom the discussion of her interests, engaging after that time to yield\r\nin part to his wishes. She could not disguise to herself that any\r\nchange would separate her from him; now she saw him each day. His\r\nconnection with Adrian and Perdita was never mentioned; he was to her a\r\nmeteor, a companionless star, which at its appointed hour rose in her\r\nhemisphere, whose appearance brought felicity, and which, although it\r\nset, was never eclipsed. He came each day to her abode of penury, and\r\nhis presence transformed it to a temple redolent with sweets, radiant\r\nwith heaven\xe2\x80\x99s own light; he partook of her delirium. \xe2\x80\x9cThey built a wall\r\nbetween them and the world\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Without, a thousand harpies raved, remorse\r\nand misery, expecting the destined moment for their invasion. Within,\r\nwas the peace as of innocence, reckless blindless, deluding joy, hope,\r\nwhose still anchor rested on placid but unconstant water.\r\n\r\nThus, while Raymond had been wrapt in visions of power and fame, while\r\nhe looked forward to entire dominion over the elements and the mind of\r\nman, the territory of his own heart escaped his notice; and from that\r\nunthought of source arose the mighty torrent that overwhelmed his will,\r\nand carried to the oblivious sea, fame, hope, and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean time what did Perdita?\r\n\r\nDuring the first months of his Protectorate, Raymond and she had been\r\ninseparable; each project was discussed with her, each plan approved by\r\nher. I never beheld any one so perfectly happy as my sweet sister. Her\r\nexpressive eyes were two stars whose beams were love; hope and\r\nlight-heartedness sat on her cloudless brow. She fed even to tears of\r\njoy on the praise and glory of her Lord; her whole existence was one\r\nsacrifice to him, and if in the humility of her heart she felt\r\nself-complacency, it arose from the reflection that she had won the\r\ndistinguished hero of the age, and had for years preserved him, even\r\nafter time had taken from love its usual nourishment. Her own feeling\r\nwas as entire as at its birth. Five years had failed to destroy the\r\ndazzling unreality of passion. Most men ruthlessly destroy the sacred\r\nveil, with which the female heart is wont to adorn the idol of its\r\naffections. Not so Raymond; he was an enchanter, whose reign was for\r\never undiminished; a king whose power never was suspended: follow him\r\nthrough the details of common life, still the same charm of grace and\r\nmajesty adorned him; nor could he be despoiled of the innate\r\ndeification with which nature had invested him. Perdita grew in beauty\r\nand excellence under his eye; I no longer recognised my reserved\r\nabstracted sister in the fascinating and open-hearted wife of Raymond.\r\nThe genius that enlightened her countenance, was now united to an\r\nexpression of benevolence, which gave divine perfection to her beauty.\r\n\r\nHappiness is in its highest degree the sister of goodness. Suffering\r\nand amiability may exist together, and writers have loved to depict\r\ntheir conjunction; there is a human and touching harmony in the\r\npicture. But perfect happiness is an attribute of angels; and those who\r\npossess it, appear angelic. Fear has been said to be the parent of\r\nreligion: even of that religion is it the generator, which leads its\r\nvotaries to sacrifice human victims at its altars; but the religion\r\nwhich springs from happiness is a lovelier growth; the religion which\r\nmakes the heart breathe forth fervent thanksgiving, and causes us to\r\npour out the overflowings of the soul before the author of our being;\r\nthat which is the parent of the imagination and the nurse of poetry;\r\nthat which bestows benevolent intelligence on the visible mechanism of\r\nthe world, and makes earth a temple with heaven for its cope. Such\r\nhappiness, goodness, and religion inhabited the mind of Perdita.\r\n\r\nDuring the five years we had spent together, a knot of happy human\r\nbeings at Windsor Castle, her blissful lot had been the frequent theme\r\nof my sister\xe2\x80\x99s conversation. From early habit, and natural affection,\r\nshe selected me in preference to Adrian or Idris, to be the partner in\r\nher overflowings of delight; perhaps, though apparently much unlike,\r\nsome secret point of resemblance, the offspring of consanguinity,\r\ninduced this preference. Often at sunset, I have walked with her, in\r\nthe sober, enshadowed forest paths, and listened with joyful sympathy.\r\nSecurity gave dignity to her passion; the certainty of a full return,\r\nleft her with no wish unfulfilled. The birth of her daughter, embryo\r\ncopy of her Raymond, filled up the measure of her content, and produced\r\na sacred and indissoluble tie between them. Sometimes she felt proud\r\nthat he had preferred her to the hopes of a crown. Sometimes she\r\nremembered that she had suffered keen anguish, when he hesitated in his\r\nchoice. But this memory of past discontent only served to enhance her\r\npresent joy. What had been hardly won, was now, entirely possessed,\r\ndoubly dear. She would look at him at a distance with the same rapture,\r\n(O, far more exuberant rapture!) that one might feel, who after the\r\nperils of a tempest, should find himself in the desired port; she would\r\nhasten towards him, to feel more certain in his arms, the reality of\r\nher bliss. This warmth of affection, added to the depth of her\r\nunderstanding, and the brilliancy of her imagination, made her beyond\r\nwords dear to Raymond.\r\n\r\nIf a feeling of dissatisfaction ever crossed her, it arose from the\r\nidea that he was not perfectly happy. Desire of renown, and\r\npresumptuous ambition, had characterized his youth. The one he had\r\nacquired in Greece; the other he had sacrificed to love. His intellect\r\nfound sufficient field for exercise in his domestic circle, whose\r\nmembers, all adorned by refinement and literature, were many of them,\r\nlike himself, distinguished by genius. Yet active life was the genuine\r\nsoil for his virtues; and he sometimes suffered tedium from the\r\nmonotonous succession of events in our retirement. Pride made him\r\nrecoil from complaint; and gratitude and affection to Perdita,\r\ngenerally acted as an opiate to all desire, save that of meriting her\r\nlove. We all observed the visitation of these feelings, and none\r\nregretted them so much as Perdita. Her life consecrated to him, was a\r\nslight sacrifice to reward his choice, but was not that sufficient\xe2\x80\x94Did\r\nhe need any gratification that she was unable to bestow? This was the\r\nonly cloud in the azure of her happiness.\r\n\r\nHis passage to power had been full of pain to both. He however attained\r\nhis wish; he filled the situation for which nature seemed to have\r\nmoulded him. His activity was fed in wholesome measure, without either\r\nexhaustion or satiety; his taste and genius found worthy expression in\r\neach of the modes human beings have invented to encage and manifest the\r\nspirit of beauty; the goodness of his heart made him never weary of\r\nconducing to the well-being of his fellow-creatures; his magnificent\r\nspirit, and aspirations for the respect and love of mankind, now\r\nreceived fruition; true, his exaltation was temporary; perhaps it were\r\nbetter that it should be so. Habit would not dull his sense of the\r\nenjoyment of power; nor struggles, disappointment and defeat await the\r\nend of that which would expire at its maturity. He determined to\r\nextract and condense all of glory, power, and achievement, which might\r\nhave resulted from a long reign, into the three years of his\r\nProtectorate.\r\n\r\nRaymond was eminently social. All that he now enjoyed would have been\r\ndevoid of pleasure to him, had it been unparticipated. But in Perdita\r\nhe possessed all that his heart could desire. Her love gave birth to\r\nsympathy; her intelligence made her understand him at a word; her\r\npowers of intellect enabled her to assist and guide him. He felt her\r\nworth. During the early years of their union, the inequality of her\r\ntemper, and yet unsubdued self-will which tarnished her character, had\r\nbeen a slight drawback to the fulness of his sentiment. Now that\r\nunchanged serenity, and gentle compliance were added to her other\r\nqualifications, his respect equalled his love. Years added to the\r\nstrictness of their union. They did not now guess at, and totter on the\r\npathway, divining the mode to please, hoping, yet fearing the\r\ncontinuance of bliss. Five years gave a sober certainty to their\r\nemotions, though it did not rob them of their etherial nature. It had\r\ngiven them a child; but it had not detracted from the personal\r\nattractions of my sister. Timidity, which in her had almost amounted to\r\nawkwardness, was exchanged for a graceful decision of manner;\r\nfrankness, instead of reserve, characterized her physiognomy; and her\r\nvoice was attuned to thrilling softness. She was now three and twenty,\r\nin the pride of womanhood, fulfilling the precious duties of wife and\r\nmother, possessed of all her heart had ever coveted. Raymond was ten\r\nyears older; to his previous beauty, noble mien, and commanding aspect,\r\nhe now added gentlest benevolence, winning tenderness, graceful and\r\nunwearied attention to the wishes of another.\r\n\r\nThe first secret that had existed between them was the visits of\r\nRaymond to Evadne. He had been struck by the fortitude and beauty of\r\nthe ill-fated Greek; and, when her constant tenderness towards him\r\nunfolded itself, he asked with astonishment, by what act of his he had\r\nmerited this passionate and unrequited love. She was for a while the\r\nsole object of his reveries; and Perdita became aware that his thoughts\r\nand time were bestowed on a subject unparticipated by her. My sister\r\nwas by nature destitute of the common feelings of anxious, petulant\r\njealousy. The treasure which she possessed in the affections of\r\nRaymond, was more necessary to her being, than the life-blood that\r\nanimated her veins\xe2\x80\x94more truly than Othello she might say,\r\n\r\n    To be once in doubt,\r\nIs\xe2\x80\x94once to be resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion she did not suspect any alienation of\r\naffection; but she conjectured that some circumstance connected with\r\nhis high place, had occasioned this mystery. She was startled and\r\npained. She began to count the long days, and months, and years which\r\nmust elapse, before he would be restored to a private station, and\r\nunreservedly to her. She was not content that, even for a time, he\r\nshould practice concealment with her. She often repined; but her trust\r\nin the singleness of his affection was undisturbed; and, when they were\r\ntogether, unchecked by fear, she opened her heart to the fullest\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nTime went on. Raymond, stopping mid-way in his wild career, paused\r\nsuddenly to think of consequences. Two results presented themselves in\r\nthe view he took of the future. That his intercourse with Evadne should\r\ncontinue a secret to, or that finally it should be discovered by\r\nPerdita. The destitute condition, and highly wrought feelings of his\r\nfriend prevented him from adverting to the possibility of exiling\r\nhimself from her. In the first event he had bidden an eternal farewell\r\nto open-hearted converse, and entire sympathy with the companion of his\r\nlife. The veil must be thicker than that invented by Turkish jealousy;\r\nthe wall higher than the unscaleable tower of Vathek, which should\r\nconceal from her the workings of his heart, and hide from her view the\r\nsecret of his actions. This idea was intolerably painful to him.\r\nFrankness and social feelings were the essence of Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s nature;\r\nwithout them his qualities became common-place; without these to spread\r\nglory over his intercourse with Perdita, his vaunted exchange of a\r\nthrone for her love, was as weak and empty as the rainbow hues which\r\nvanish when the sun is down. But there was no remedy. Genius, devotion,\r\nand courage; the adornments of his mind, and the energies of his soul,\r\nall exerted to their uttermost stretch, could not roll back one hair\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreadth the wheel of time\xe2\x80\x99s chariot; that which had been was written\r\nwith the adamantine pen of reality, on the everlasting volume of the\r\npast; nor could agony and tears suffice to wash out one iota from the\r\nact fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBut this was the best side of the question. What, if circumstance\r\nshould lead Perdita to suspect, and suspecting to be resolved? The\r\nfibres of his frame became relaxed, and cold dew stood on his forehead,\r\nat this idea. Many men may scoff at his dread; but he read the future;\r\nand the peace of Perdita was too dear to him, her speechless agony too\r\ncertain, and too fearful, not to unman him. His course was speedily\r\ndecided upon. If the worst befell; if she learnt the truth, he would\r\nneither stand her reproaches, or the anguish of her altered looks. He\r\nwould forsake her, England, his friends, the scenes of his youth, the\r\nhopes of coming time, he would seek another country, and in other\r\nscenes begin life again. Having resolved on this, he became calmer. He\r\nendeavoured to guide with prudence the steeds of destiny through the\r\ndevious road which he had chosen, and bent all his efforts the better\r\nto conceal what he could not alter.\r\n\r\nThe perfect confidence that subsisted between Perdita and him, rendered\r\nevery communication common between them. They opened each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters, even as, until now, the inmost fold of the heart of each was\r\ndisclosed to the other. A letter came unawares, Perdita read it. Had it\r\ncontained confirmation, she must have been annihilated. As it was,\r\ntrembling, cold, and pale, she sought Raymond. He was alone, examining\r\nsome petitions lately presented. She entered silently, sat on a sofa\r\nopposite to him, and gazed on him with a look of such despair, that\r\nwildest shrieks and dire moans would have been tame exhibitions of\r\nmisery, compared to the living incarnation of the thing itself\r\nexhibited by her.\r\n\r\nAt first he did not take his eyes from the papers; when he raised them,\r\nhe was struck by the wretchedness manifest on her altered cheek; for a\r\nmoment he forgot his own acts and fears, and asked with\r\nconsternation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDearest girl, what is the matter; what has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied at first; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet not so,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\nhurrying on in her speech; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have secrets, Raymond; where have you\r\nbeen lately, whom have you seen, what do you conceal from me?\xe2\x80\x94why am I\r\nbanished from your confidence? Yet this is not it\xe2\x80\x94I do not intend to\r\nentrap you with questions\xe2\x80\x94one will suffice\xe2\x80\x94am I completely a wretch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith trembling hand she gave him the paper, and sat white and\r\nmotionless looking at him while he read it. He recognised the\r\nhand-writing of Evadne, and the colour mounted in his cheeks. With\r\nlightning-speed he conceived the contents of the letter; all was now\r\ncast on one die; falsehood and artifice were trifles in comparison with\r\nthe impending ruin. He would either entirely dispel Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions, or quit her for ever. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nto blame; but you must pardon me. I was in the wrong to commence a\r\nsystem of concealment; but I did it for the sake of sparing you pain;\r\nand each day has rendered it more difficult for me to alter my plan.\r\nBesides, I was instigated by delicacy towards the unhappy writer of\r\nthese few lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerdita gasped: \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all\xe2\x80\x94this paper tells all. I am placed in the most difficult\r\ncircumstances. I have done my best, though perhaps I have done wrong.\r\nMy love for you is inviolate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerdita shook her head doubtingly: \xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nthat it is not. You would deceive me, but I will not be deceived. I\r\nhave lost you, myself, my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not believe me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI would give up all, and expire with\r\njoy, so that in death I could feel that you were true\xe2\x80\x94but that cannot\r\nbe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerdita,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do not see the precipice on which\r\nyou stand. You may believe that I did not enter on my present line of\r\nconduct without reluctance and pain. I knew that it was possible that\r\nyour suspicions might be excited; but I trusted that my simple word\r\nwould cause them to disappear. I built my hope on your confidence. Do\r\nyou think that I will be questioned, and my replies disdainfully set\r\naside? Do you think that I will be suspected, perhaps watched,\r\ncross-questioned, and disbelieved? I am not yet fallen so low; my\r\nhonour is not yet so tarnished. You have loved me; I adored you. But\r\nall human sentiments come to an end. Let our affection expire\xe2\x80\x94but let\r\nit not be exchanged for distrust and recrimination. Heretofore we have\r\nbeen friends\xe2\x80\x94lovers\xe2\x80\x94let us not become enemies, mutual spies. I cannot\r\nlive the object of suspicion\xe2\x80\x94you cannot believe me\xe2\x80\x94let us part!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Perdita, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that it would come to this! Are we\r\nnot already parted? Does not a stream, boundless as ocean, deep as\r\nvacuum, yawn between us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaymond rose, his voice was broken, his features convulsed, his manner\r\ncalm as the earthquake-cradling atmosphere, he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI am rejoiced\r\nthat you take my decision so philosophically. Doubtless you will play\r\nthe part of the injured wife to admiration. Sometimes you may be stung\r\nwith the feeling that you have wronged me, but the condolence of your\r\nrelatives, the pity of the world, the complacency which the\r\nconsciousness of your own immaculate innocence will bestow, will be\r\nexcellent balm;\xe2\x80\x94me you will never see more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaymond moved towards the door. He forgot that each word he spoke was\r\nfalse. He personated his assumption of innocence even to\r\nself-deception. Have not actors wept, as they pourtrayed imagined\r\npassion? A more intense feeling of the reality of fiction possessed\r\nRaymond. He spoke with pride; he felt injured. Perdita looked up; she\r\nsaw his angry glance; his hand was on the lock of the door. She started\r\nup, she threw herself on his neck, she gasped and sobbed; he took her\r\nhand, and leading her to the sofa, sat down near her. Her head fell on\r\nhis shoulder, she trembled, alternate changes of fire and ice ran\r\nthrough her limbs: observing her emotion he spoke with softened\r\naccents:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blow is given. I will not part from you in anger;\xe2\x80\x94I owe you too\r\nmuch. I owe you six years of unalloyed happiness. But they are passed.\r\nI will not live the mark of suspicion, the object of jealousy. I love\r\nyou too well. In an eternal separation only can either of us hope for\r\ndignity and propriety of action. We shall not then be degraded from our\r\ntrue characters. Faith and devotion have hitherto been the essence of\r\nour intercourse;\xe2\x80\x94these lost, let us not cling to the seedless husk of\r\nlife, the unkernelled shell. You have your child, your brother, Idris,\r\nAdrian\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Perdita, \xe2\x80\x9cthe writer of that letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUncontrollable indignation flashed from the eyes of Raymond. He knew\r\nthat this accusation at least was false. \xe2\x80\x9cEntertain this belief,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9chug it to your heart\xe2\x80\x94make it a pillow to your head, an opiate\r\nfor your eyes \xe2\x80\x94I am content. But, by the God that made me, hell is not\r\nmore false than the word you have spoken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerdita was struck by the impassioned seriousness of his asseverations.\r\nShe replied with earnestness, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not refuse to believe you, Raymond;\r\non the contrary I promise to put implicit faith in your simple word.\r\nOnly assure me that your love and faith towards me have never been\r\nviolated; and suspicion, and doubt, and jealousy will at once be\r\ndispersed. We shall continue as we have ever done, one heart, one hope,\r\none life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already assured you of my fidelity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond with\r\ndisdainful coldness, \xe2\x80\x9ctriple assertions will avail nothing where one is\r\ndespised. I will say no more; for I can add nothing to what I have\r\nalready said, to what you before contemptuously set aside. This\r\ncontention is unworthy of both of us; and I confess that I am weary of\r\nreplying to charges at once unfounded and unkind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerdita tried to read his countenance, which he angrily averted. There\r\nwas so much of truth and nature in his resentment, that her doubts were\r\ndispelled. Her countenance, which for years had not expressed a feeling\r\nunallied to affection, became again radiant and satisfied. She found it\r\nhowever no easy task to soften and reconcile Raymond. At first he\r\nrefused to stay to hear her. But she would not be put off; secure of\r\nhis unaltered love, she was willing to undertake any labour, use any\r\nentreaty, to dispel his anger. She obtained an hearing, he sat in\r\nhaughty silence, but he listened. She first assured him of her\r\nboundless confidence; of this he must be conscious, since but for that\r\nshe would not seek to detain him. She enumerated their years of\r\nhappiness; she brought before him past scenes of intimacy and\r\nhappiness; she pictured their future life, she mentioned their\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x94tears unbidden now filled her eyes. She tried to disperse them,\r\nbut they refused to be checked\xe2\x80\x94her utterance was choaked. She had not\r\nwept before. Raymond could not resist these signs of distress: he felt\r\nperhaps somewhat ashamed of the part he acted of the injured man, he\r\nwho was in truth the injurer. And then he devoutly loved Perdita; the\r\nbend of her head, her glossy ringlets, the turn of her form were to him\r\nsubjects of deep tenderness and admiration; as she spoke, her melodious\r\ntones entered his soul; he soon softened towards her, comforting and\r\ncaressing her, and endeavouring to cheat himself into the belief that\r\nhe had never wronged her.\r\n\r\nRaymond staggered forth from this scene, as a man might do, who had\r\nbeen just put to the torture, and looked forward to when it would be\r\nagain inflicted. He had sinned against his own honour, by affirming,\r\nswearing to, a direct falsehood; true this he had palmed on a woman,\r\nand it might therefore be deemed less base\xe2\x80\x94by others\xe2\x80\x94not by him;\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nwhom had he deceived?\xe2\x80\x94his own trusting, devoted, affectionate Perdita,\r\nwhose generous belief galled him doubly, when he remembered the parade\r\nof innocence with which it had been exacted. The mind of Raymond was\r\nnot so rough cast, nor had been so rudely handled, in the circumstance\r\nof life, as to make him proof to these considerations\xe2\x80\x94on the contrary,\r\nhe was all nerve; his spirit was as a pure fire, which fades and\r\nshrinks from every contagion of foul atmosphere: but now the contagion\r\nhad become incorporated with its essence, and the change was the more\r\npainful. Truth and falsehood, love and hate lost their eternal\r\nboundaries, heaven rushed in to mingle with hell; while his sensitive\r\nmind, turned to a field for such battle, was stung to madness. He\r\nheartily despised himself, he was angry with Perdita, and the idea of\r\nEvadne was attended by all that was hideous and cruel. His passions,\r\nalways his masters, acquired fresh strength, from the long sleep in\r\nwhich love had cradled them, the clinging weight of destiny bent him\r\ndown; he was goaded, tortured, fiercely impatient of that worst of\r\nmiseries, the sense of remorse. This troubled state yielded by degrees,\r\nto sullen animosity, and depression of spirits. His dependants, even\r\nhis equals, if in his present post he had any, were startled to find\r\nanger, derision, and bitterness in one, before distinguished for\r\nsuavity and benevolence of manner. He transacted public business with\r\ndistaste, and hastened from it to the solitude which was at once his\r\nbane and relief. He mounted a fiery horse, that which had borne him\r\nforward to victory in Greece; he fatigued himself with deadening\r\nexercise, losing the pangs of a troubled mind in animal sensation.\r\n\r\nHe slowly recovered himself; yet, at last, as one might from the\r\neffects of poison, he lifted his head from above the vapours of fever\r\nand passion into the still atmosphere of calm reflection. He meditated\r\non what was best to be done. He was first struck by the space of time\r\nthat had elapsed, since madness, rather than any reasonable impulse,\r\nhad regulated his actions. A month had gone by, and during that time he\r\nhad not seen Evadne. Her power, which was linked to few of the enduring\r\nemotions of his heart, had greatly decayed. He was no longer her\r\nslave\xe2\x80\x94no longer her lover: he would never see her more, and by the\r\ncompleteness of his return, deserve the confidence of Perdita.\r\n\r\nYet, as he thus determined, fancy conjured up the miserable abode of\r\nthe Greek girl. An abode, which from noble and lofty principle, she had\r\nrefused to exchange for one of greater luxury. He thought of the\r\nsplendour of her situation and appearance when he first knew her; he\r\nthought of her life at Constantinople, attended by every circumstance\r\nof oriental magnificence; of her present penury, her daily task of\r\nindustry, her lorn state, her faded, famine-struck cheek. Compassion\r\nswelled his breast; he would see her once again; he would devise some\r\nplan for restoring her to society, and the enjoyment of her rank; their\r\nseparation would then follow, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nAgain he thought, how during this long month, he had avoided Perdita,\r\nflying from her as from the stings of his own conscience. But he was\r\nawake now; all this should be remedied; and future devotion erase the\r\nmemory of this only blot on the serenity of their life. He became\r\ncheerful, as he thought of this, and soberly and resolutely marked out\r\nthe line of conduct he would adopt. He remembered that he had promised\r\nPerdita to be present this very evening (the 19th of October,\r\nanniversary of his election as Protector) at a festival given in his\r\nhonour. Good augury should this festival be of the happiness of future\r\nyears. First, he would look in on Evadne; he would not stay; but he\r\nowed her some account, some compensation for his long and unannounced\r\nabsence; and then to Perdita, to the forgotten world, to the duties of\r\nsociety, the splendour of rank, the enjoyment of power.\r\n\r\nAfter the scene sketched in the preceding pages, Perdita had\r\ncontemplated an entire change in the manners and conduct of Raymond.\r\nShe expected freedom of communication, and a return to those habits of\r\naffectionate intercourse which had formed the delight of her life. But\r\nRaymond did not join her in any of her avocations. He transacted the\r\nbusiness of the day apart from her; he went out, she knew not whither.\r\nThe pain inflicted by this disappointment was tormenting and keen. She\r\nlooked on it as a deceitful dream, and tried to throw off the\r\nconsciousness of it; but like the shirt of Nessus, it clung to her very\r\nflesh, and ate with sharp agony into her vital principle. She possessed\r\nthat (though such an assertion may appear a paradox) which belongs to\r\nfew, a capacity of happiness. Her delicate organization and creative\r\nimagination rendered her peculiarly susceptible of pleasurable emotion.\r\nThe overflowing warmth of her heart, by making love a plant of deep\r\nroot and stately growth, had attuned her whole soul to the reception of\r\nhappiness, when she found in Raymond all that could adorn love and\r\nsatisfy her imagination. But if the sentiment on which the fabric of\r\nher existence was founded, became common place through participation,\r\nthe endless succession of attentions and graceful action snapt by\r\ntransfer, his universe of love wrested from her, happiness must depart,\r\nand then be exchanged for its opposite. The same peculiarities of\r\ncharacter rendered her sorrows agonies; her fancy magnified them, her\r\nsensibility made her for ever open to their renewed impression; love\r\nenvenomed the heart-piercing sting. There was neither submission,\r\npatience, nor self-abandonment in her grief; she fought with it,\r\nstruggled beneath it, and rendered every pang more sharp by resistance.\r\nAgain and again the idea recurred, that he loved another. She did him\r\njustice; she believed that he felt a tender affection for her; but give\r\na paltry prize to him who in some life-pending lottery has calculated\r\non the possession of tens of thousands, and it will disappoint him more\r\nthan a blank. The affection and amity of a Raymond might be\r\ninestimable; but, beyond that affection, embosomed deeper than\r\nfriendship, was the indivisible treasure of love. Take the sum in its\r\ncompleteness, and no arithmetic can calculate its price; take from it\r\nthe smallest portion, give it but the name of parts, separate it into\r\ndegrees and sections, and like the magician\xe2\x80\x99s coin, the valueless gold\r\nof the mine, is turned to vilest substance. There is a meaning in the\r\neye of love; a cadence in its voice, an irradiation in its smile, the\r\ntalisman of whose enchantments one only can possess; its spirit is\r\nelemental, its essence single, its divinity an unit. The very heart and\r\nsoul of Raymond and Perdita had mingled, even as two mountain brooks\r\nthat join in their descent, and murmuring and sparkling flow over\r\nshining pebbles, beside starry flowers; but let one desert its primal\r\ncourse, or be dammed up by choaking obstruction, and the other shrinks\r\nin its altered banks. Perdita was sensible of the failing of the tide\r\nthat fed her life. Unable to support the slow withering of her hopes,\r\nshe suddenly formed a plan, resolving to terminate at once the period\r\nof misery, and to bring to an happy conclusion the late disastrous\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary was at hand of the exaltation of Raymond to the office\r\nof Protector; and it was customary to celebrate this day by a splendid\r\nfestival. A variety of feelings urged Perdita to shed double\r\nmagnificence over the scene; yet, as she arrayed herself for the\r\nevening gala, she wondered herself at the pains she took, to render\r\nsumptuous the celebration of an event which appeared to her the\r\nbeginning of her sufferings. Woe befall the day, she thought, woe,\r\ntears, and mourning betide the hour, that gave Raymond another hope\r\nthan love, another wish than my devotion; and thrice joyful the moment\r\nwhen he shall be restored to me! God knows, I put my trust in his vows,\r\nand believe his asserted faith\xe2\x80\x94but for that, I would not seek what I am\r\nnow resolved to attain. Shall two years more be thus passed, each day\r\nadding to our alienation, each act being another stone piled on the\r\nbarrier which separates us? No, my Raymond, my only beloved, sole\r\npossession of Perdita! This night, this splendid assembly, these\r\nsumptuous apartments, and this adornment of your tearful girl, are all\r\nunited to celebrate your abdication. Once for me, you relinquished the\r\nprospect of a crown. That was in days of early love, when I could only\r\nhold out the hope, not the assurance of happiness. Now you have the\r\nexperience of all that I can give, the heart\xe2\x80\x99s devotion, taintless\r\nlove, and unhesitating subjection to you. You must choose between these\r\nand your protectorate. This, proud noble, is your last night! Perdita\r\nhas bestowed on it all of magnificent and dazzling that your heart best\r\nloves\xe2\x80\x94but, from these gorgeous rooms, from this princely attendance,\r\nfrom power and elevation, you must return with to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s sun to our\r\nrural abode; for I would not buy an immortality of joy, by the\r\nendurance of one more week sister to the last.\r\n\r\nBrooding over this plan, resolved when the hour should come, to\r\npropose, and insist upon its accomplishment, secure of his consent, the\r\nheart of Perdita was lightened, or rather exalted. Her cheek was\r\nflushed by the expectation of struggle; her eyes sparkled with the hope\r\nof triumph. Having cast her fate upon a die, and feeling secure of\r\nwinning, she, whom I have named as bearing the stamp of queen of\r\nnations on her noble brow, now rose superior to humanity, and seemed in\r\ncalm power, to arrest with her finger, the wheel of destiny. She had\r\nnever before looked so supremely lovely.\r\n\r\nWe, the Arcadian shepherds of the tale, had intended to be present at\r\nthis festivity, but Perdita wrote to entreat us not to come, or to\r\nabsent ourselves from Windsor; for she (though she did not reveal her\r\nscheme to us) resolved the next morning to return with Raymond to our\r\ndear circle, there to renew a course of life in which she had found\r\nentire felicity. Late in the evening she entered the apartments\r\nappropriated to the festival. Raymond had quitted the palace the night\r\nbefore; he had promised to grace the assembly, but he had not yet\r\nreturned. Still she felt sure that he would come at last; and the wider\r\nthe breach might appear at this crisis, the more secure she was of\r\nclosing it for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was as I said, the nineteenth of October; the autumn was far\r\nadvanced and dreary. The wind howled; the half bare trees were\r\ndespoiled of the remainder of their summer ornament; the state of the\r\nair which induced the decay of vegetation, was hostile to cheerfulness\r\nor hope. Raymond had been exalted by the determination he had made; but\r\nwith the declining day his spirits declined. First he was to visit\r\nEvadne, and then to hasten to the palace of the Protectorate. As he\r\nwalked through the wretched streets in the neighbourhood of the\r\nluckless Greek\xe2\x80\x99s abode, his heart smote him for the whole course of his\r\nconduct towards her. First, his having entered into any engagement that\r\nshould permit her to remain in such a state of degradation; and then,\r\nafter a short wild dream, having left her to drear solitude, anxious\r\nconjecture, and bitter, still\xe2\x80\x94disappointed expectation. What had she\r\ndone the while, how supported his absence and neglect? Light grew dim\r\nin these close streets, and when the well known door was opened, the\r\nstaircase was shrouded in perfect night. He groped his way up, he\r\nentered the garret, he found Evadne stretched speechless, almost\r\nlifeless on her wretched bed. He called for the people of the house,\r\nbut could learn nothing from them, except that they knew nothing. Her\r\nstory was plain to him, plain and distinct as the remorse and horror\r\nthat darted their fangs into him. When she found herself forsaken by\r\nhim, she lost the heart to pursue her usual avocations; pride forbade\r\nevery application to him; famine was welcomed as the kind porter to the\r\ngates of death, within whose opening folds she should now, without sin,\r\nquickly repose. No creature came near her, as her strength failed.\r\n\r\nIf she died, where could there be found on record a murderer, whose\r\ncruel act might compare with his? What fiend more wanton in his\r\nmischief, what damned soul more worthy of perdition! But he was not\r\nreserved for this agony of self-reproach. He sent for medical\r\nassistance; the hours passed, spun by suspense into ages; the darkness\r\nof the long autumnal night yielded to day, before her life was secure.\r\nHe had her then removed to a more commodious dwelling, and hovered\r\nabout her, again and again to assure himself that she was safe.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his greatest suspense and fear as to the event, he\r\nremembered the festival given in his honour, by Perdita; in his honour\r\nthen, when misery and death were affixing indelible disgrace to his\r\nname, honour to him whose crimes deserved a scaffold; this was the\r\nworst mockery. Still Perdita would expect him; he wrote a few\r\nincoherent words on a scrap of paper, testifying that he was well, and\r\nbade the woman of the house take it to the palace, and deliver it into\r\nthe hands of the wife of the Lord Protector. The woman, who did not\r\nknow him, contemptuously asked, how he thought she should gain\r\nadmittance, particularly on a festal night, to that lady\xe2\x80\x99s presence?\r\nRaymond gave her his ring to ensure the respect of the menials. Thus,\r\nwhile Perdita was entertaining her guests, and anxiously awaiting the\r\narrival of her lord, his ring was brought her; and she was told that a\r\npoor woman had a note to deliver to her from its wearer.\r\n\r\nThe vanity of the old gossip was raised by her commission, which, after\r\nall, she did not understand, since she had no suspicion, even now that\r\nEvadne\xe2\x80\x99s visitor was Lord Raymond. Perdita dreaded a fall from his\r\nhorse, or some similar accident\xe2\x80\x94till the woman\xe2\x80\x99s answers woke other\r\nfears. From a feeling of cunning blindly exercised, the officious, if\r\nnot malignant messenger, did not speak of Evadne\xe2\x80\x99s illness; but she\r\ngarrulously gave an account of Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s frequent visits, adding to her\r\nnarration such circumstances, as, while they convinced Perdita of its\r\ntruth, exaggerated the unkindness and perfidy of Raymond. Worst of all,\r\nhis absence now from the festival, his message wholly unaccounted for,\r\nexcept by the disgraceful hints of the woman, appeared the deadliest\r\ninsult. Again she looked at the ring, it was a small ruby, almost\r\nheart-shaped, which she had herself given him. She looked at the\r\nhand-writing, which she could not mistake, and repeated to herself the\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo not, I charge you, I entreat you, permit your guests to\r\nwonder at my absence:\xe2\x80\x9d the while the old crone going on with her talk,\r\nfilled her ear with a strange medley of truth and falsehood. At length\r\nPerdita dismissed her.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl returned to the assembly, where her presence had not been\r\nmissed. She glided into a recess somewhat obscured, and leaning against\r\nan ornamental column there placed, tried to recover herself. Her\r\nfaculties were palsied. She gazed on some flowers that stood near in a\r\ncarved vase: that morning she had arranged them, they were rare and\r\nlovely plants; even now all aghast as she was, she observed their\r\nbrilliant colours and starry shapes.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDivine infoliations of the spirit\r\nof beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cYe droop not, neither do ye mourn; the\r\ndespair that clasps my heart, has not spread contagion over you!\xe2\x80\x94Why am\r\nI not a partner of your insensibility, a sharer in your calm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused. \xe2\x80\x9cTo my task,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued mentally, \xe2\x80\x9cmy guests must not\r\nperceive the reality, either as it regards him or me. I obey; they\r\nshall not, though I die the moment they are gone. They shall behold the\r\nantipodes of what is real\xe2\x80\x94for I will appear to live\xe2\x80\x94while I am\xe2\x80\x94dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nIt required all her self-command, to suppress the gush of tears\r\nself-pity caused at this idea. After many struggles, she succeeded, and\r\nturned to join the company.\r\n\r\nAll her efforts were now directed to the dissembling her internal\r\nconflict. She had to play the part of a courteous hostess; to attend to\r\nall; to shine the focus of enjoyment and grace. She had to do this,\r\nwhile in deep woe she sighed for loneliness, and would gladly have\r\nexchanged her crowded rooms for dark forest depths, or a drear,\r\nnight-enshadowed heath. But she became gay. She could not keep in the\r\nmedium, nor be, as was usual with her, placidly content. Every one\r\nremarked her exhilaration of spirits; as all actions appear graceful in\r\nthe eye of rank, her guests surrounded her applaudingly, although there\r\nwas a sharpness in her laugh, and an abruptness in her sallies, which\r\nmight have betrayed her secret to an attentive observer. She went on,\r\nfeeling that, if she had paused for a moment, the checked waters of\r\nmisery would have deluged her soul, that her wrecked hopes would raise\r\ntheir wailing voices, and that those who now echoed her mirth, and\r\nprovoked her repartees, would have shrunk in fear from her convulsive\r\ndespair. Her only consolation during the violence which she did\r\nherself, was to watch the motions of an illuminated clock, and\r\ninternally count the moments which must elapse before she could be\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAt length the rooms began to thin. Mocking her own desires, she rallied\r\nher guests on their early departure. One by one they left her\xe2\x80\x94at length\r\nshe pressed the hand of her last visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cHow cold and damp your hand\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x9d said her friend; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are over fatigued, pray hasten to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPerdita smiled faintly\xe2\x80\x94her guest left her; the carriage rolling down\r\nthe street assured the final departure. Then, as if pursued by an\r\nenemy, as if wings had been at her feet, she flew to her own apartment,\r\nshe dismissed her attendants, she locked the doors, she threw herself\r\nwildly on the floor, she bit her lips even to blood to suppress her\r\nshrieks, and lay long a prey to the vulture of despair, striving not to\r\nthink, while multitudinous ideas made a home of her heart; and ideas,\r\nhorrid as furies, cruel as vipers, and poured in with such swift\r\nsuccession, that they seemed to jostle and wound each other, while they\r\nworked her up to madness.\r\n\r\nAt length she rose, more composed, not less miserable. She stood before\r\na large mirror\xe2\x80\x94she gazed on her reflected image; her light and graceful\r\ndress, the jewels that studded her hair, and encircled her beauteous\r\narms and neck, her small feet shod in satin, her profuse and glossy\r\ntresses, all were to her clouded brow and woe-begone countenance like a\r\ngorgeous frame to a dark tempest-pourtraying picture. \xe2\x80\x9cVase am I,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cvase brimful of despair\xe2\x80\x99s direst essence. Farewell, Perdita!\r\nfarewell, poor girl! never again will you see yourself thus; luxury and\r\nwealth are no longer yours; in the excess of your poverty you may envy\r\nthe homeless beggar; most truly am I without a home! I live on a barren\r\ndesart, which, wide and interminable, brings forth neither fruit or\r\nflower; in the midst is a solitary rock, to which thou, Perdita, art\r\nchained, and thou seest the dreary level stretch far away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw open her window, which looked on the palace-garden. Light and\r\ndarkness were struggling together, and the orient was streaked by\r\nroseate and golden rays. One star only trembled in the depth of the\r\nkindling atmosphere. The morning air blowing freshly over the dewy\r\nplants, rushed into the heated room. \xe2\x80\x9cAll things go on,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nPerdita, \xe2\x80\x9call things proceed, decay, and perish! When noontide has\r\npassed, and the weary day has driven her team to their western stalls,\r\nthe fires of heaven rise from the East, moving in their accustomed\r\npath, they ascend and descend the skiey hill. When their course is\r\nfulfilled, the dial begins to cast westward an uncertain shadow; the\r\neye-lids of day are opened, and birds and flowers, the startled\r\nvegetation, and fresh breeze awaken; the sun at length appears, and in\r\nmajestic procession climbs the capitol of heaven. All proceeds, changes\r\nand dies, except the sense of misery in my bursting heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, all proceeds and changes: what wonder then, that love has journied\r\non to its setting, and that the lord of my life has changed? We call\r\nthe supernal lights fixed, yet they wander about yonder plain, and if I\r\nlook again where I looked an hour ago, the face of the eternal heavens\r\nis altered. The silly moon and inconstant planets vary nightly their\r\nerratic dance; the sun itself, sovereign of the sky, ever and anon\r\ndeserts his throne, and leaves his dominion to night and winter. Nature\r\ngrows old, and shakes in her decaying limbs,\xe2\x80\x94creation has become\r\nbankrupt! What wonder then, that eclipse and death have led to\r\ndestruction the light of thy life, O Perdita!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus sad and disarranged were the thoughts of my poor sister, when she\r\nbecame assured of the infidelity of Raymond. All her virtues and all\r\nher defects tended to make the blow incurable. Her affection for me,\r\nher brother, for Adrian and Idris, was subject as it were to the\r\nreigning passion of her heart; even her maternal tenderness borrowed\r\nhalf its force from the delight she had in tracing Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s features\r\nand expression in the infant\xe2\x80\x99s countenance. She had been reserved and\r\neven stern in childhood; but love had softened the asperities of her\r\ncharacter, and her union with Raymond had caused her talents and\r\naffections to unfold themselves; the one betrayed, and the other lost,\r\nshe in some degree returned to her ancient disposition. The\r\nconcentrated pride of her nature, forgotten during her blissful dream,\r\nawoke, and with its adder\xe2\x80\x99s sting pierced her heart; her humility of\r\nspirit augmented the power of the venom; she had been exalted in her\r\nown estimation, while distinguished by his love: of what worth was she,\r\nnow that he thrust her from this preferment? She had been proud of\r\nhaving won and preserved him\xe2\x80\x94but another had won him from her, and her\r\nexultation was as cold as a water quenched ember.\r\n\r\nWe, in our retirement, remained long in ignorance of her misfortune.\r\nSoon after the festival she had sent for her child, and then she seemed\r\nto have forgotten us. Adrian observed a change during a visit that he\r\nafterward paid them; but he could not tell its extent, or divine the\r\ncause. They still appeared in public together, and lived under the same\r\nroof. Raymond was as usual courteous, though there was, on occasions,\r\nan unbidden haughtiness, or painful abruptness in his manners, which\r\nstartled his gentle friend; his brow was not clouded but disdain sat on\r\nhis lips, and his voice was harsh. Perdita was all kindness and\r\nattention to her lord; but she was silent, and beyond words sad. She\r\nhad grown thin and pale; and her eyes often filled with tears.\r\nSometimes she looked at Raymond, as if to say\xe2\x80\x94That it should be so! At\r\nothers her countenance expressed\xe2\x80\x94I will still do all I can to make you\r\nhappy. But Adrian read with uncertain aim the charactery of her face,\r\nand might mistake.\xe2\x80\x94Clara was always with her, and she seemed most at\r\nease, when, in an obscure corner, she could sit holding her child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, silent and lonely. Still Adrian was unable to guess the truth; he\r\nentreated them to visit us at Windsor, and they promised to come during\r\nthe following month.\r\n\r\nIt was May before they arrived: the season had decked the forest trees\r\nwith leaves, and its paths with a thousand flowers. We had notice of\r\ntheir intention the day before; and, early in the morning, Perdita\r\narrived with her daughter. Raymond would follow soon, she said; he had\r\nbeen detained by business. According to Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s account, I had\r\nexpected to find her sad; but, on the contrary, she appeared in the\r\nhighest spirits: true, she had grown thin, her eyes were somewhat\r\nhollow, and her cheeks sunk, though tinged by a bright glow. She was\r\ndelighted to see us; caressed our children, praised their growth and\r\nimprovement; Clara also was pleased to meet again her young friend\r\nAlfred; all kinds of childish games were entered into, in which Perdita\r\njoined. She communicated her gaiety to us, and as we amused ourselves\r\non the Castle Terrace, it appeared that a happier, less care-worn party\r\ncould not have been assembled. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is better, Mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clara,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthan being in that dismal London, where you often cry, and never laugh\r\nas you do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, little foolish thing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her mother,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand remember any one that mentions London is sent to Coventry for an\r\nhour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon after, Raymond arrived. He did not join as usual in the playful\r\nspirit of the rest; but, entering into conversation with Adrian and\r\nmyself, by degrees we seceded from our companions, and Idris and\r\nPerdita only remained with the children. Raymond talked of his new\r\nbuildings; of his plan for an establishment for the better education of\r\nthe poor; as usual Adrian and he entered into argument, and the time\r\nslipped away unperceived.\r\n\r\nWe assembled again towards evening, and Perdita insisted on our having\r\nrecourse to music. She wanted, she said, to give us a specimen of her\r\nnew accomplishment; for since she had been in London, she had applied\r\nherself to music, and sang, without much power, but with a great deal\r\nof sweetness. We were not permitted by her to select any but\r\nlight-hearted melodies; and all the Operas of Mozart were called into\r\nservice, that we might choose the most exhilarating of his airs. Among\r\nthe other transcendant attributes of Mozart\xe2\x80\x99s music, it possesses more\r\nthan any other that of appearing to come from the heart; you enter into\r\nthe passions expressed by him, and are transported with grief, joy,\r\nanger, or confusion, as he, our soul\xe2\x80\x99s master, chooses to inspire. For\r\nsome time, the spirit of hilarity was kept up; but, at length, Perdita\r\nreceded from the piano, for Raymond had joined in the trio of \xe2\x80\x9c_Taci\r\ningiusto core_,\xe2\x80\x9d in Don Giovanni, whose arch entreaty was softened by\r\nhim into tenderness, and thrilled her heart with memories of the\r\nchanged past; it was the same voice, the same tone, the self-same\r\nsounds and words, which often before she had received, as the homage of\r\nlove to her\xe2\x80\x94no longer was it that; and this concord of sound with its\r\ndissonance of expression penetrated her with regret and despair. Soon\r\nafter Idris, who was at the harp, turned to that passionate and\r\nsorrowful air in Figaro, \xe2\x80\x9c_Porgi, amor, qualche ristoro_,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the\r\ndeserted Countess laments the change of the faithless Almaviva. The\r\nsoul of tender sorrow is breathed forth in this strain; and the sweet\r\nvoice of Idris, sustained by the mournful chords of her instrument,\r\nadded to the expression of the words. During the pathetic appeal with\r\nwhich it concludes, a stifled sob attracted our attention to Perdita,\r\nthe cessation of the music recalled her to herself, she hastened out of\r\nthe hall\xe2\x80\x94I followed her. At first, she seemed to wish to shun me; and\r\nthen, yielding to my earnest questioning, she threw herself on my neck,\r\nand wept aloud:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9conce more on your friendly\r\nbreast, my beloved brother, can the lost Perdita pour forth her\r\nsorrows. I had imposed a law of silence on myself; and for months I\r\nhave kept it. I do wrong in weeping now, and greater wrong in giving\r\nwords to my grief. I will not speak! Be it enough for you to know that\r\nI am miserable\xe2\x80\x94be it enough for you to know, that the painted veil of\r\nlife is rent, that I sit for ever shrouded in darkness and gloom, that\r\ngrief is my sister, everlasting lamentation my mate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to console her; I did not question her! but I caressed\r\nher, assured her of my deepest affection and my intense interest in the\r\nchanges of her fortune:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDear words,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cexpressions of love\r\ncome upon my ear, like the remembered sounds of forgotten music, that\r\nhad been dear to me. They are vain, I know; how very vain in their\r\nattempt to soothe or comfort me. Dearest Lionel, you cannot guess what\r\nI have suffered during these long months. I have read of mourners in\r\nancient days, who clothed themselves in sackcloth, scattered dust upon\r\ntheir heads, ate their bread mingled with ashes, and took up their\r\nabode on the bleak mountain tops, reproaching heaven and earth aloud\r\nwith their misfortunes. Why this is the very luxury of sorrow! thus one\r\nmight go on from day to day contriving new extravagances, revelling in\r\nthe paraphernalia of woe, wedded to all the appurtenances of despair.\r\nAlas! I must for ever conceal the wretchedness that consumes me. I must\r\nweave a veil of dazzling falsehood to hide my grief from vulgar eyes,\r\nsmoothe my brow, and paint my lips in deceitful smiles\xe2\x80\x94even in solitude\r\nI dare not think how lost I am, lest I become insane and rave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears and agitation of my poor sister had rendered her unfit to\r\nreturn to the circle we had left\xe2\x80\x94so I persuaded her to let me drive her\r\nthrough the park; and, during the ride, I induced her to confide the\r\ntale of her unhappiness to me, fancying that talking of it would\r\nlighten the burthen, and certain that, if there were a remedy, it\r\nshould be found and secured to her.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks had elapsed since the festival of the anniversary, and\r\nshe had been unable to calm her mind, or to subdue her thoughts to any\r\nregular train. Sometimes she reproached herself for taking too bitterly\r\nto heart, that which many would esteem an imaginary evil; but this was\r\nno subject for reason; and, ignorant as she was of the motives and true\r\nconduct of Raymond, things assumed for her even a worse appearance,\r\nthan the reality warranted. He was seldom at the palace; never, but\r\nwhen he was assured that his public duties would prevent his remaining\r\nalone with Perdita. They seldom addressed each other, shunning\r\nexplanation, each fearing any communication the other might make.\r\nSuddenly, however, the manners of Raymond changed; he appeared to\r\ndesire to find opportunities of bringing about a return to kindness and\r\nintimacy with my sister. The tide of love towards her appeared to flow\r\nagain; he could never forget, how once he had been devoted to her,\r\nmaking her the shrine and storehouse wherein to place every thought and\r\nevery sentiment. Shame seemed to hold him back; yet he evidently wished\r\nto establish a renewal of confidence and affection. From the moment\r\nPerdita had sufficiently recovered herself to form any plan of action,\r\nshe had laid one down, which now she prepared to follow. She received\r\nthese tokens of returning love with gentleness; she did not shun his\r\ncompany; but she endeavoured to place a barrier in the way of familiar\r\nintercourse or painful discussion, which mingled pride and shame\r\nprevented Raymond from surmounting. He began at last to shew signs of\r\nangry impatience, and Perdita became aware that the system she had\r\nadopted could not continue; she must explain herself to him; she could\r\nnot summon courage to speak\xe2\x80\x94she wrote thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead this letter with patience, I entreat you. It will contain no\r\nreproaches. Reproach is indeed an idle word: for what should I reproach\r\nyou?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me in some degree to explain my feeling; without that, we shall\r\nboth grope in the dark, mistaking one another; erring from the path\r\nwhich may conduct, one of us at least, to a more eligible mode of life\r\nthan that led by either during the last few weeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved you\xe2\x80\x94I love you\xe2\x80\x94neither anger nor pride dictates these lines;\r\nbut a feeling beyond, deeper, and more unalterable than either. My\r\naffections are wounded; it is impossible to heal them:\xe2\x80\x94cease then the\r\nvain endeavour, if indeed that way your endeavours tend. Forgiveness!\r\nReturn! Idle words are these! I forgive the pain I endure; but the\r\ntrodden path cannot be retraced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommon affection might have been satisfied with common usages. I\r\nbelieved that you read my heart, and knew its devotion, its unalienable\r\nfidelity towards you. I never loved any but you. You came the embodied\r\nimage of my fondest dreams. The praise of men, power and high\r\naspirations attended your career. Love for you invested the world for\r\nme in enchanted light; it was no longer the earth I trod\xe2\x80\x94the earth,\r\ncommon mother, yielding only trite and stale repetition of objects and\r\ncircumstances old and worn out. I lived in a temple glorified by\r\nintensest sense of devotion and rapture; I walked, a consecrated being,\r\ncontemplating only your power, your excellence;\r\n\r\nFor O, you stood beside me, like my youth,\r\nTransformed for me the real to a dream,\r\nCloathing the palpable and familiar\r\nWith golden exhalations of the dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The bloom has vanished from my life\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94there is no morning to this all\r\ninvesting night; no rising to the set-sun of love. In those days the\r\nrest of the world was nothing to me: all other men\xe2\x80\x94I never considered\r\nnor felt what they were; nor did I look on you as one of them.\r\nSeparated from them; exalted in my heart; sole possessor of my\r\naffections; single object of my hopes, the best half of myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Raymond, were we not happy? Did the sun shine on any, who could\r\nenjoy its light with purer and more intense bliss? It was not\xe2\x80\x94it is not\r\na common infidelity at which I repine. It is the disunion of an whole\r\nwhich may not have parts; it is the carelessness with which you have\r\nshaken off the mantle of election with which to me you were invested,\r\nand have become one among the many. Dream not to alter this. Is not\r\nlove a divinity, because it is immortal? Did not I appear sanctified,\r\neven to myself, because this love had for its temple my heart? I have\r\ngazed on you as you slept, melted even to tears, as the idea filled my\r\nmind, that all I possessed lay cradled in those idolized, but mortal\r\nlineaments before me. Yet, even then, I have checked thick-coming fears\r\nwith one thought; I would not fear death, for the emotions that linked\r\nus must be immortal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I do not fear death. I should be well pleased to close my\r\neyes, never more to open them again. And yet I fear it; even as I fear\r\nall things; for in any state of being linked by the chain of memory\r\nwith this, happiness would not return\xe2\x80\x94even in Paradise, I must feel\r\nthat your love was less enduring than the mortal beatings of my fragile\r\nheart, every pulse of which knells audibly,\r\n\r\n    The funeral note\r\nOf love, deep buried, without resurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94me miserable; for love extinct there is no resurrection!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I love you. Yet, and for ever, would I contribute all I possess to\r\nyour welfare. On account of a tattling world; for the sake of my\xe2\x80\x94of our\r\nchild, I would remain by you, Raymond, share your fortunes, partake\r\nyour counsel. Shall it be thus? We are no longer lovers; nor can I call\r\nmyself a friend to any; since, lost as I am, I have no thought to spare\r\nfrom my own wretched, engrossing self. But it will please me to see you\r\neach day! to listen to the public voice praising you; to keep up your\r\npaternal love for our girl; to hear your voice; to know that I am near\r\nyou, though you are no longer mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to break the chains that bind us, say the word, and it\r\nshall be done\xe2\x80\x94I will take all the blame on myself, of harshness or\r\nunkindness, in the world\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet, as I have said, I should be best pleased, at least for the\r\npresent, to live under the same roof with you. When the fever of my\r\nyoung life is spent; when placid age shall tame the vulture that\r\ndevours me, friendship may come, love and hope being dead. May this be\r\ntrue? Can my soul, inextricably linked to this perishable frame, become\r\nlethargic and cold, even as this sensitive mechanism shall lose its\r\nyouthful elasticity? Then, with lack-lustre eyes, grey hairs, and\r\nwrinkled brow, though now the words sound hollow and meaningless, then,\r\ntottering on the grave\xe2\x80\x99s extreme edge, I may be\xe2\x80\x94your affectionate and\r\ntrue friend,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPERDITA.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nRaymond\xe2\x80\x99s answer was brief. What indeed could he reply to her\r\ncomplaints, to her griefs which she jealously paled round, keeping out\r\nall thought of remedy. \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding your bitter letter,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor bitter I must call it, you are the chief person in my estimation,\r\nand it is your happiness that I would principally consult. Do that\r\nwhich seems best to you: and if you can receive gratification from one\r\nmode of life in preference to another, do not let me be any obstacle. I\r\nforesee that the plan which you mark out in your letter will not endure\r\nlong; but you are mistress of yourself, and it is my sincere wish to\r\ncontribute as far as you will permit me to your happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRaymond has prophesied well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perdita, \xe2\x80\x9calas, that it should be\r\nso! our present mode of life cannot continue long, yet I will not be\r\nthe first to propose alteration. He beholds in me one whom he has\r\ninjured even unto death; and I derive no hope from his kindness; no\r\nchange can possibly be brought about even by his best intentions. As\r\nwell might Cleopatra have worn as an ornament the vinegar which\r\ncontained her dissolved pearl, as I be content with the love that\r\nRaymond can now offer me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI own that I did not see her misfortune with the same eyes as Perdita.\r\nAt all events methought that the wound could be healed; and, if they\r\nremained together, it would be so. I endeavoured therefore to sooth and\r\nsoften her mind; and it was not until after many endeavours that I gave\r\nup the task as impracticable. Perdita listened to me impatiently, and\r\nanswered with some asperity:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that any of your arguments\r\nare new to me? or that my own burning wishes and intense anguish have\r\nnot suggested them all a thousand times, with far more eagerness and\r\nsubtlety than you can put into them? Lionel, you cannot understand what\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s love is. In days of happiness I have often repeated to myself,\r\nwith a grateful heart and exulting spirit, all that Raymond sacrificed\r\nfor me. I was a poor, uneducated, unbefriended, mountain girl, raised\r\nfrom nothingness by him. All that I possessed of the luxuries of life\r\ncame from him. He gave me an illustrious name and noble station; the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s respect reflected from his own glory: all this joined to his\r\nown undying love, inspired me with sensations towards him, akin to\r\nthose with which we regard the Giver of life. I gave him love only. I\r\ndevoted myself to him: imperfect creature that I was, I took myself to\r\ntask, that I might become worthy of him. I watched over my hasty\r\ntemper, subdued my burning impatience of character, schooled my\r\nself-engrossing thoughts, educating myself to the best perfection I\r\nmight attain, that the fruit of my exertions might be his happiness. I\r\ntook no merit to myself for this. He deserved it all\xe2\x80\x94all labour, all\r\ndevotion, all sacrifice; I would have toiled up a scaleless Alp, to\r\npluck a flower that would please him. I was ready to quit you all, my\r\nbeloved and gifted companions, and to live only with him, for him. I\r\ncould not do otherwise, even if I had wished; for if we are said to\r\nhave two souls, he was my better soul, to which the other was a\r\nperpetual slave. One only return did he owe me, even fidelity. I earned\r\nthat; I deserved it. Because I was mountain bred, unallied to the noble\r\nand wealthy, shall he think to repay me by an empty name and station?\r\nLet him take them back; without his love they are nothing to me. Their\r\nonly merit in my eyes was that they were his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus passionately Perdita ran on. When I adverted to the question of\r\ntheir entire separation, she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBe it so! One day the period\r\nwill arrive; I know it, and feel it. But in this I am a coward. This\r\nimperfect companionship, and our masquerade of union, are strangely\r\ndear to me. It is painful, I allow, destructive, impracticable. It\r\nkeeps up a perpetual fever in my veins; it frets my immedicable wound;\r\nit is instinct with poison. Yet I must cling to it; perhaps it will\r\nkill me soon, and thus perform a thankful office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Raymond had remained with Adrian and Idris. He was\r\nnaturally frank; the continued absence of Perdita and myself became\r\nremarkable; and Raymond soon found relief from the constraint of\r\nmonths, by an unreserved confidence with his two friends. He related to\r\nthem the situation in which he had found Evadne. At first, from\r\ndelicacy to Adrian he concealed her name; but it was divulged in the\r\ncourse of his narrative, and her former lover heard with the most acute\r\nagitation the history of her sufferings. Idris had shared Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s ill\r\nopinion of the Greek; but Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s account softened and interested\r\nher. Evadne\xe2\x80\x99s constancy, fortitude, even her ill-fated and\r\nill-regulated love, were matter of admiration and pity; especially\r\nwhen, from the detail of the events of the nineteenth of October, it\r\nwas apparent that she preferred suffering and death to any in her eyes\r\ndegrading application for the pity and assistance of her lover. Her\r\nsubsequent conduct did not diminish this interest. At first, relieved\r\nfrom famine and the grave, watched over by Raymond with the tenderest\r\nassiduity, with that feeling of repose peculiar to convalescence,\r\nEvadne gave herself up to rapturous gratitude and love. But reflection\r\nreturned with health. She questioned him with regard to the motives\r\nwhich had occasioned his critical absence. She framed her enquiries\r\nwith Greek subtlety; she formed her conclusions with the decision and\r\nfirmness peculiar to her disposition. She could not divine, that the\r\nbreach which she had occasioned between Raymond and Perdita was already\r\nirreparable: but she knew, that under the present system it would be\r\nwidened each day, and that its result must be to destroy her lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness, and to implant the fangs of remorse in his heart. From the\r\nmoment that she perceived the right line of conduct, she resolved to\r\nadopt it, and to part from Raymond for ever. Conflicting passions,\r\nlong-cherished love, and self-inflicted disappointment, made her regard\r\ndeath alone as sufficient refuge for her woe. But the same feelings and\r\nopinions which had before restrained her, acted with redoubled force;\r\nfor she knew that the reflection that he had occasioned her death,\r\nwould pursue Raymond through life, poisoning every enjoyment, clouding\r\nevery prospect. Besides, though the violence of her anguish made life\r\nhateful, it had not yet produced that monotonous, lethargic sense of\r\nchangeless misery which for the most part produces suicide. Her energy\r\nof character induced her still to combat with the ills of life; even\r\nthose attendant on hopeless love presented themselves, rather in the\r\nshape of an adversary to be overcome, than of a victor to whom she must\r\nsubmit. Besides, she had memories of past tenderness to cherish,\r\nsmiles, words, and even tears, to con over, which, though remembered in\r\ndesertion and sorrow, were to be preferred to the forgetfulness of the\r\ngrave. It was impossible to guess at the whole of her plan. Her letter\r\nto Raymond gave no clue for discovery; it assured him, that she was in\r\nno danger of wanting the means of life; she promised in it to preserve\r\nherself, and some future day perhaps to present herself to him in a\r\nstation not unworthy of her. She then bade him, with the eloquence of\r\ndespair and of unalterable love, a last farewell.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances were now related to Adrian and Idris. Raymond\r\nthen lamented the cureless evil of his situation with Perdita. He\r\ndeclared, notwithstanding her harshness, he even called it coldness,\r\nthat he loved her. He had been ready once with the humility of a\r\npenitent, and the duty of a vassal, to surrender himself to her; giving\r\nup his very soul to her tutelage, to become her pupil, her slave, her\r\nbondsman. She had rejected these advances; and the time for such\r\nexuberant submission, which must be founded on love and nourished by\r\nit, was now passed. Still all his wishes and endeavours were directed\r\ntowards her peace, and his chief discomfort arose from the perception\r\nthat he exerted himself in vain. If she were to continue inflexible in\r\nthe line of conduct she now pursued, they must part. The combinations\r\nand occurrences of this senseless mode of intercourse were maddening to\r\nhim. Yet he would not propose the separation. He was haunted by the\r\nfear of causing the death of one or other of the beings implicated in\r\nthese events; and he could not persuade himself to undertake to direct\r\nthe course of events, lest, ignorant of the land he traversed, he\r\nshould lead those attached to the car into irremediable ruin.\r\n\r\nAfter a discussion on this subject, which lasted for several hours, he\r\ntook leave of his friends, and returned to town, unwilling to meet\r\nPerdita before us, conscious, as we all must be, of the thoughts\r\nuppermost in the minds of both. Perdita prepared to follow him with her\r\nchild. Idris endeavoured to persuade her to remain. My poor sister\r\nlooked at the counsellor with affright. She knew that Raymond had\r\nconversed with her; had he instigated this request?\xe2\x80\x94was this to be the\r\nprelude to their eternal separation?\xe2\x80\x94I have said, that the defects of\r\nher character awoke and acquired vigour from her unnatural position.\r\nShe regarded with suspicion the invitation of Idris; she embraced me,\r\nas if she were about to be deprived of my affection also: calling me\r\nher more than brother, her only friend, her last hope, she pathetically\r\nconjured me not to cease to love her; and with encreased anxiety she\r\ndeparted for London, the scene and cause of all her misery.\r\n\r\nThe scenes that followed, convinced her that she had not yet fathomed\r\nthe obscure gulph into which she had plunged. Her unhappiness assumed\r\nevery day a new shape; every day some unexpected event seemed to close,\r\nwhile in fact it led onward, the train of calamities which now befell\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe selected passion of the soul of Raymond was ambition. Readiness of\r\ntalent, a capacity of entering into, and leading the dispositions of\r\nmen; earnest desire of distinction were the awakeners and nurses of his\r\nambition. But other ingredients mingled with these, and prevented him\r\nfrom becoming the calculating, determined character, which alone forms\r\na successful hero. He was obstinate, but not firm; benevolent in his\r\nfirst movements; harsh and reckless when provoked. Above all, he was\r\nremorseless and unyielding in the pursuit of any object of desire,\r\nhowever lawless. Love of pleasure, and the softer sensibilities of our\r\nnature, made a prominent part of his character, conquering the\r\nconqueror; holding him in at the moment of acquisition; sweeping away\r\nambition\xe2\x80\x99s web; making him forget the toil of weeks, for the sake of\r\none moment\xe2\x80\x99s indulgence of the new and actual object of his wishes.\r\nObeying these impulses, he had become the husband of Perdita: egged on\r\nby them, he found himself the lover of Evadne. He had now lost both. He\r\nhad neither the ennobling self-gratulation, which constancy inspires,\r\nto console him, nor the voluptuous sense of abandonment to a forbidden,\r\nbut intoxicating passion. His heart was exhausted by the recent events;\r\nhis enjoyment of life was destroyed by the resentment of Perdita, and\r\nthe flight of Evadne; and the inflexibility of the former, set the last\r\nseal upon the annihilation of his hopes. As long as their disunion\r\nremained a secret, he cherished an expectation of re-awakening past\r\ntenderness in her bosom; now that we were all made acquainted with\r\nthese occurrences, and that Perdita, by declaring her resolves to\r\nothers, in a manner pledged herself to their accomplishment, he gave up\r\nthe idea of re-union as futile, and sought only, since he was unable to\r\ninfluence her to change, to reconcile himself to the present state of\r\nthings. He made a vow against love and its train of struggles,\r\ndisappointment and remorse, and sought in mere sensual enjoyment, a\r\nremedy for the injurious inroads of passion.\r\n\r\nDebasement of character is the certain follower of such pursuits. Yet\r\nthis consequence would not have been immediately remarkable, if Raymond\r\nhad continued to apply himself to the execution of his plans for the\r\npublic benefit, and the fulfilling his duties as Protector. But,\r\nextreme in all things, given up to immediate impressions, he entered\r\nwith ardour into this new pursuit of pleasure, and followed up the\r\nincongruous intimacies occasioned by it without reflection or\r\nforesight. The council-chamber was deserted; the crowds which attended\r\non him as agents to his various projects were neglected. Festivity, and\r\neven libertinism, became the order of the day.\r\n\r\nPerdita beheld with affright the encreasing disorder. For a moment she\r\nthought that she could stem the torrent, and that Raymond could be\r\ninduced to hear reason from her.\xe2\x80\x94Vain hope! The moment of her influence\r\nwas passed. He listened with haughtiness, replied disdainfully; and, if\r\nin truth, she succeeded in awakening his conscience, the sole effect\r\nwas that he sought an opiate for the pang in oblivious riot. With the\r\nenergy natural to her, Perdita then endeavoured to supply his place.\r\nTheir still apparent union permitted her to do much; but no woman\r\ncould, in the end, present a remedy to the encreasing negligence of the\r\nProtector; who, as if seized with a paroxysm of insanity, trampled on\r\nall ceremony, all order, all duty, and gave himself up to license.\r\n\r\nReports of these strange proceedings reached us, and we were undecided\r\nwhat method to adopt to restore our friend to himself and his country,\r\nwhen Perdita suddenly appeared among us. She detailed the progress of\r\nthe mournful change, and entreated Adrian and myself to go up to\r\nLondon, and endeavour to remedy the encreasing evil:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTell him,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9ctell Lord Raymond, that my presence shall no longer annoy him.\r\nThat he need not plunge into this destructive dissipation for the sake\r\nof disgusting me, and causing me to fly. This purpose is now\r\naccomplished; he will never see me more. But let me, it is my last\r\nentreaty, let me in the praises of his countrymen and the prosperity of\r\nEngland, find the choice of my youth justified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring our ride up to town, Adrian and I discussed and argued upon\r\nRaymond\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, and his falling off from the hopes of permanent\r\nexcellence on his part, which he had before given us cause to\r\nentertain. My friend and I had both been educated in one school, or\r\nrather I was his pupil in the opinion, that steady adherence to\r\nprinciple was the only road to honour; a ceaseless observance of the\r\nlaws of general utility, the only conscientious aim of human ambition.\r\nBut though we both entertained these ideas, we differed in their\r\napplication. Resentment added also a sting to my censure; and I\r\nreprobated Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in severe terms. Adrian was more benign,\r\nmore considerate. He admitted that the principles that I laid down were\r\nthe best; but he denied that they were the only ones. Quoting the text,\r\n_there are many mansions in my father\xe2\x80\x99s house_, he insisted that the\r\nmodes of becoming good or great, varied as much as the dispositions of\r\nmen, of whom it might be said, as of the leaves of the forest, there\r\nwere no two alike.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in London at about eleven at night. We conjectured,\r\nnotwithstanding what we had heard, that we should find Raymond in St.\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s: thither we sped. The chamber was full\xe2\x80\x94but there was no\r\nProtector; and there was an austere discontent manifest on the\r\ncountenances of the leaders, and a whispering and busy tattle among the\r\nunderlings, not less ominous. We hastened to the palace of the\r\nProtectorate. We found Raymond in his dining room with six others: the\r\nbottle was being pushed about merrily, and had made considerable\r\ninroads on the understanding of one or two. He who sat near Raymond was\r\ntelling a story, which convulsed the rest with laughter.\r\n\r\nRaymond sat among them, though while he entered into the spirit of the\r\nhour, his natural dignity never forsook him. He was gay, playful,\r\nfascinating\xe2\x80\x94but never did he overstep the modesty of nature, or the\r\nrespect due to himself, in his wildest sallies. Yet I own, that\r\nconsidering the task which Raymond had taken on himself as Protector of\r\nEngland, and the cares to which it became him to attend, I was\r\nexceedingly provoked to observe the worthless fellows on whom his time\r\nwas wasted, and the jovial if not drunken spirit which seemed on the\r\npoint of robbing him of his better self. I stood watching the scene,\r\nwhile Adrian flitted like a shadow in among them, and, by a word and\r\nlook of sobriety, endeavoured to restore order in the assembly. Raymond\r\nexpressed himself delighted to see him, declaring that he should make\r\none in the festivity of the night.\r\n\r\nThis action of Adrian provoked me. I was indignant that he should sit\r\nat the same table with the companions of Raymond\xe2\x80\x94men of abandoned\r\ncharacters, or rather without any, the refuse of high-bred luxury, the\r\ndisgrace of their country. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me entreat Adrian,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to\r\ncomply: rather join with me in endeavouring to withdraw Lord Raymond\r\nfrom this scene, and restore him to other society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is neither the time nor place for\r\nthe delivery of a moral lecture: take my word for it that my amusements\r\nand society are not so bad as you imagine. We are neither hypocrites or\r\nfools \xe2\x80\x94for the rest, \xe2\x80\x98Dost thou think because thou art virtuous, there\r\nshall be no more cakes and ale?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned angrily away: \xe2\x80\x9cVerney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are very cynical:\r\nsit down; or if you will not, perhaps, as you are not a frequent\r\nvisitor, Lord Raymond will humour you, and accompany us, as we had\r\npreviously agreed upon, to parliament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaymond looked keenly at him; he could read benignity only in his\r\ngentle lineaments; he turned to me, observing with scorn my moody and\r\nstern demeanour. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9cI have promised for you, enable\r\nme to keep my engagement. Come with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Raymond made an uneasy\r\nmovement, and laconically replied\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe party in the mean time had broken up. They looked at the pictures,\r\nstrolled into the other apartments, talked of billiards, and one by one\r\nvanished. Raymond strode angrily up and down the room. I stood ready to\r\nreceive and reply to his reproaches. Adrian leaned against the wall.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is infinitely ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cif you were school-boys,\r\nyou could not conduct yourselves more unreasonably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is only part of a\r\nsystem:\xe2\x80\x94a scheme of tyranny to which I will never submit. Because I am\r\nProtector of England, am I to be the only slave in its empire? My\r\nprivacy invaded, my actions censured, my friends insulted? But I will\r\nget rid of the whole together.\xe2\x80\x94Be you witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d and he took the star,\r\ninsignia of office, from his breast, and threw it on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nrenounce my office, I abdicate my power\xe2\x80\x94assume it who will!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him assume it,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9cwho can pronounce himself, or\r\nwhom the world will pronounce to be your superior. There does not exist\r\nthe man in England with adequate presumption. Know yourself, Raymond,\r\nand your indignation will cease; your complacency return. A few months\r\nago, whenever we prayed for the prosperity of our country, or our own,\r\nwe at the same time prayed for the life and welfare of the Protector,\r\nas indissolubly linked to it. Your hours were devoted to our benefit,\r\nyour ambition was to obtain our commendation. You decorated our towns\r\nwith edifices, you bestowed on us useful establishments, you gifted the\r\nsoil with abundant fertility. The powerful and unjust cowered at the\r\nsteps of your judgment-seat, and the poor and oppressed arose like\r\nmorn-awakened flowers under the sunshine of your protection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you wonder that we are all aghast and mourn, when this appears\r\nchanged? But, come, this splenetic fit is already passed; resume your\r\nfunctions; your partizans will hail you; your enemies be silenced; our\r\nlove, honour, and duty will again be manifested towards you. Master\r\nyourself, Raymond, and the world is subject to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this would be very good sense, if addressed to another,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nRaymond, moodily, \xe2\x80\x9ccon the lesson yourself, and you, the first peer of\r\nthe land, may become its sovereign. You the good, the wise, the just,\r\nmay rule all hearts. But I perceive, too soon for my own happiness, too\r\nlate for England\xe2\x80\x99s good, that I undertook a task to which I am unequal.\r\nI cannot rule myself. My passions are my masters; my smallest impulse\r\nmy tyrant. Do you think that I renounced the Protectorate (and I have\r\nrenounced it) in a fit of spleen? By the God that lives, I swear never\r\nto take up that bauble again; never again to burthen myself with the\r\nweight of care and misery, of which that is the visible sign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce I desired to be a king. It was in the hey-day of youth, in the\r\npride of boyish folly. I knew myself when I renounced it. I renounced\r\nit to gain \xe2\x80\x94no matter what\xe2\x80\x94for that also I have lost. For many months I\r\nhave submitted to this mock majesty\xe2\x80\x94this solemn jest. I am its dupe no\r\nlonger. I will be free.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost that which adorned and dignified my life; that which\r\nlinked me to other men. Again I am a solitary man; and I will become\r\nagain, as in my early years, a wanderer, a soldier of fortune. My\r\nfriends, for Verney, I feel that you are my friend, do not endeavour to\r\nshake my resolve. Perdita, wedded to an imagination, careless of what\r\nis behind the veil, whose charactery is in truth faulty and vile,\r\nPerdita has renounced me. With her it was pretty enough to play a\r\nsovereign\xe2\x80\x99s part; and, as in the recesses of your beloved forest we\r\nacted masques, and imagined ourselves Arcadian shepherds, to please the\r\nfancy of the moment\xe2\x80\x94so was I content, more for Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s sake than my\r\nown, to take on me the character of one of the great ones of the earth;\r\nto lead her behind the scenes of grandeur, to vary her life with a\r\nshort act of magnificence and power. This was to be the colour; love\r\nand confidence the substance of our existence. But we must live, and\r\nnot act our lives; pursuing the shadow, I lost the reality\xe2\x80\x94now I\r\nrenounce both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdrian, I am about to return to Greece, to become again a soldier,\r\nperhaps a conqueror. Will you accompany me? You will behold new scenes;\r\nsee a new people; witness the mighty struggle there going forward\r\nbetween civilization and barbarism; behold, and perhaps direct the\r\nefforts of a young and vigorous population, for liberty and order. Come\r\nwith me. I have expected you. I waited for this moment; all is\r\nprepared;\xe2\x80\x94will you accompany me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Adrian. \xe2\x80\x9cImmediately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReflect!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWherefore?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Raymond\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, I have done nothing else\r\nthan reflect on this step the live-long summer; and be assured that\r\nAdrian has condensed an age of reflection into this little moment. Do\r\nnot talk of reflection; from this moment I abjure it; this is my only\r\nhappy moment during a long interval of time. I must go, Lionel\xe2\x80\x94the Gods\r\nwill it; and I must. Do not endeavour to deprive me of my companion,\r\nthe out-cast\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word more concerning unkind, unjust Perdita. For a time, I thought\r\nthat, by watching a complying moment, fostering the still warm ashes, I\r\nmight relume in her the flame of love. It is more cold within her, than\r\na fire left by gypsies in winter-time, the spent embers crowned by a\r\npyramid of snow. Then, in endeavouring to do violence to my own\r\ndisposition, I made all worse than before. Still I think, that time,\r\nand even absence, may restore her to me. Remember, that I love her\r\nstill, that my dearest hope is that she will again be mine. I know,\r\nthough she does not, how false the veil is which she has spread over\r\nthe reality\xe2\x80\x94do not endeavour to rend this deceptive covering, but by\r\ndegrees withdraw it. Present her with a mirror, in which she may know\r\nherself; and, when she is an adept in that necessary but difficult\r\nscience, she will wonder at her present mistake, and hasten to restore\r\nto me, what is by right mine, her forgiveness, her kind thoughts, her\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter these events, it was long before we were able to attain any\r\ndegree of composure. A moral tempest had wrecked our richly freighted\r\nvessel, and we, remnants of the diminished crew, were aghast at the\r\nlosses and changes which we had undergone. Idris passionately loved her\r\nbrother, and could ill brook an absence whose duration was uncertain;\r\nhis society was dear and necessary to me\xe2\x80\x94I had followed up my chosen\r\nliterary occupations with delight under his tutorship and assistance;\r\nhis mild philosophy, unerring reason, and enthusiastic friendship were\r\nthe best ingredient, the exalted spirit of our circle; even the\r\nchildren bitterly regretted the loss of their kind playfellow. Deeper\r\ngrief oppressed Perdita. In spite of resentment, by day and night she\r\nfigured to herself the toils and dangers of the wanderers. Raymond\r\nabsent, struggling with difficulties, lost to the power and rank of the\r\nProtectorate, exposed to the perils of war, became an object of anxious\r\ninterest; not that she felt any inclination to recall him, if recall\r\nmust imply a return to their former union. Such return she felt to be\r\nimpossible; and while she believed it to be thus, and with anguish\r\nregretted that so it should be, she continued angry and impatient with\r\nhim, who occasioned her misery. These perplexities and regrets caused\r\nher to bathe her pillow with nightly tears, and to reduce her in person\r\nand in mind to the shadow of what she had been. She sought solitude,\r\nand avoided us when in gaiety and unrestrained affection we met in a\r\nfamily circle. Lonely musings, interminable wanderings, and solemn\r\nmusic were her only pastimes. She neglected even her child; shutting\r\nher heart against all tenderness, she grew reserved towards me, her\r\nfirst and fast friend.\r\n\r\nI could not see her thus lost, without exerting myself to remedy the\r\nevil \xe2\x80\x94remediless I knew, if I could not in the end bring her to\r\nreconcile herself to Raymond. Before he went I used every argument,\r\nevery persuasion to induce her to stop his journey. She answered the\r\none with a gush of tears\xe2\x80\x94telling me that to be persuaded\xe2\x80\x94life and the\r\ngoods of life were a cheap exchange. It was not will that she wanted,\r\nbut the capacity; again and again she declared, it were as easy to\r\nenchain the sea, to put reins on the wind\xe2\x80\x99s viewless courses, as for\r\nher to take truth for falsehood, deceit for honesty, heartless\r\ncommunion for sincere, confiding love. She answered my reasonings more\r\nbriefly, declaring with disdain, that the reason was hers; and, until I\r\ncould persuade her that the past could be unacted, that maturity could\r\ngo back to the cradle, and that all that was could become as though it\r\nhad never been, it was useless to assure her that no real change had\r\ntaken place in her fate. And thus with stern pride she suffered him to\r\ngo, though her very heart-strings cracked at the fulfilling of the act,\r\nwhich rent from her all that made life valuable.\r\n\r\nTo change the scene for her, and even for ourselves, all unhinged by\r\nthe cloud that had come over us, I persuaded my two remaining\r\ncompanions that it were better that we should absent ourselves for a\r\ntime from Windsor. We visited the north of England, my native Ulswater,\r\nand lingered in scenes dear from a thousand associations. We lengthened\r\nour tour into Scotland, that we might see Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond;\r\nthence we crossed to Ireland, and passed several weeks in the\r\nneighbourhood of Killarney. The change of scene operated to a great\r\ndegree as I expected; after a year\xe2\x80\x99s absence, Perdita returned in\r\ngentler and more docile mood to Windsor. The first sight of this place\r\nfor a time unhinged her. Here every spot was distinct with associations\r\nnow grown bitter. The forest glades, the ferny dells, and lawny\r\nuplands, the cultivated and cheerful country spread around the silver\r\npathway of ancient Thames, all earth, air, and wave, took up one choral\r\nvoice, inspired by memory, instinct with plaintive regret.\r\n\r\nBut my essay towards bringing her to a saner view of her own situation,\r\ndid not end here. Perdita was still to a great degree uneducated. When\r\nfirst she left her peasant life, and resided with the elegant and\r\ncultivated Evadne, the only accomplishment she brought to any\r\nperfection was that of painting, for which she had a taste almost\r\namounting to genius. This had occupied her in her lonely cottage, when\r\nshe quitted her Greek friend\xe2\x80\x99s protection. Her pallet and easel were\r\nnow thrown aside; did she try to paint, thronging recollections made\r\nher hand tremble, her eyes fill with tears. With this occupation she\r\ngave up almost every other; and her mind preyed upon itself almost to\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, since Adrian had first withdrawn me from my selvatic\r\nwilderness to his own paradise of order and beauty, I had been wedded\r\nto literature. I felt convinced that however it might have been in\r\nformer times, in the present stage of the world, no man\xe2\x80\x99s faculties\r\ncould be developed, no man\xe2\x80\x99s moral principle be enlarged and liberal,\r\nwithout an extensive acquaintance with books. To me they stood in the\r\nplace of an active career, of ambition, and those palpable excitements\r\nnecessary to the multitude. The collation of philosophical opinions,\r\nthe study of historical facts, the acquirement of languages, were at\r\nonce my recreation, and the serious aim of my life. I turned author\r\nmyself. My productions however were sufficiently unpretending; they\r\nwere confined to the biography of favourite historical characters,\r\nespecially those whom I believed to have been traduced, or about whom\r\nclung obscurity and doubt.\r\n\r\nAs my authorship increased, I acquired new sympathies and pleasures. I\r\nfound another and a valuable link to enchain me to my fellow-creatures;\r\nmy point of sight was extended, and the inclinations and capacities of\r\nall human beings became deeply interesting to me. Kings have been\r\ncalled the fathers of their people. Suddenly I became as it were the\r\nfather of all mankind. Posterity became my heirs. My thoughts were gems\r\nto enrich the treasure house of man\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual possessions; each\r\nsentiment was a precious gift I bestowed on them. Let not these\r\naspirations be attributed to vanity. They were not expressed in words,\r\nnor even reduced to form in my own mind; but they filled my soul,\r\nexalting my thoughts, raising a glow of enthusiasm, and led me out of\r\nthe obscure path in which I before walked, into the bright\r\nnoon-enlightened highway of mankind, making me, citizen of the world, a\r\ncandidate for immortal honors, an eager aspirant to the praise and\r\nsympathy of my fellow men.\r\n\r\nNo one certainly ever enjoyed the pleasures of composition more\r\nintensely than I. If I left the woods, the solemn music of the waving\r\nbranches, and the majestic temple of nature, I sought the vast halls of\r\nthe Castle, and looked over wide, fertile England, spread beneath our\r\nregal mount, and listened the while to inspiring strains of music. At\r\nsuch times solemn harmonies or spirit-stirring airs gave wings to my\r\nlagging thoughts, permitting them, methought, to penetrate the last\r\nveil of nature and her God, and to display the highest beauty in\r\nvisible expression to the understandings of men. As the music went on,\r\nmy ideas seemed to quit their mortal dwelling house; they shook their\r\npinions and began a flight, sailing on the placid current of thought,\r\nfilling the creation with new glory, and rousing sublime imagery that\r\nelse had slept voiceless. Then I would hasten to my desk, weave the\r\nnew-found web of mind in firm texture and brilliant colours, leaving\r\nthe fashioning of the material to a calmer moment.\r\n\r\nBut this account, which might as properly belong to a former period of\r\nmy life as to the present moment, leads me far afield. It was the\r\npleasure I took in literature, the discipline of mind I found arise\r\nfrom it, that made me eager to lead Perdita to the same pursuits. I\r\nbegan with light hand and gentle allurement; first exciting her\r\ncuriosity, and then satisfying it in such a way as might occasion her,\r\nat the same time that she half forgot her sorrows in occupation, to\r\nfind in the hours that succeeded a reaction of benevolence and\r\ntoleration.\r\n\r\nIntellectual activity, though not directed towards books, had always\r\nbeen my sister\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic. It had been displayed early in life,\r\nleading her out to solitary musing among her native mountains, causing\r\nher to form innumerous combinations from common objects, giving\r\nstrength to her perceptions, and swiftness to their arrangement. Love\r\nhad come, as the rod of the master-prophet, to swallow up every minor\r\npropensity. Love had doubled all her excellencies, and placed a diadem\r\non her genius. Was she to cease to love? Take the colours and odour\r\nfrom the rose, change the sweet nutriment of mother\xe2\x80\x99s milk to gall and\r\npoison; as easily might you wean Perdita from love. She grieved for the\r\nloss of Raymond with an anguish, that exiled all smile from her lips,\r\nand trenched sad lines on her brow of beauty. But each day seemed to\r\nchange the nature of her suffering, and every succeeding hour forced\r\nher to alter (if so I may style it) the fashion of her soul\xe2\x80\x99s mourning\r\ngarb. For a time music was able to satisfy the cravings of her mental\r\nhunger, and her melancholy thoughts renewed themselves in each change\r\nof key, and varied with every alteration in the strain. My schooling\r\nfirst impelled her towards books; and, if music had been the food of\r\nsorrow, the productions of the wise became its medicine. The\r\nacquisition of unknown languages was too tedious an occupation, for one\r\nwho referred every expression to the universe within, and read not, as\r\nmany do, for the mere sake of filling up time; but who was still\r\nquestioning herself and her author, moulding every idea in a thousand\r\nways, ardently desirous for the discovery of truth in every sentence.\r\nShe sought to improve her understanding; mechanically her heart and\r\ndispositions became soft and gentle under this benign discipline. After\r\nawhile she discovered, that amidst all her newly acquired knowledge,\r\nher own character, which formerly she fancied that she thoroughly\r\nunderstood, became the first in rank among the terrae incognitae, the\r\npathless wilds of a country that had no chart. Erringly and strangely\r\nshe began the task of self-examination with self-condemnation. And then\r\nagain she became aware of her own excellencies, and began to balance\r\nwith juster scales the shades of good and evil. I, who longed beyond\r\nwords, to restore her to the happiness it was still in her power to\r\nenjoy, watched with anxiety the result of these internal proceedings.\r\n\r\nBut man is a strange animal. We cannot calculate on his forces like\r\nthat of an engine; and, though an impulse draw with a forty-horse power\r\nat what appears willing to yield to one, yet in contempt of calculation\r\nthe movement is not effected. Neither grief, philosophy, nor love could\r\nmake Perdita think with mildness of the dereliction of Raymond. She now\r\ntook pleasure in my society; towards Idris she felt and displayed a\r\nfull and affectionate sense of her worth\xe2\x80\x94she restored to her child in\r\nabundant measure her tenderness and care. But I could discover, amidst\r\nall her repinings, deep resentment towards Raymond, and an unfading\r\nsense of injury, that plucked from me my hope, when I appeared nearest\r\nto its fulfilment. Among other painful restrictions, she has occasioned\r\nit to become a law among us, never to mention Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s name before\r\nher. She refused to read any communications from Greece, desiring me\r\nonly to mention when any arrived, and whether the wanderers were well.\r\nIt was curious that even little Clara observed this law towards her\r\nmother. This lovely child was nearly eight years of age. Formerly she\r\nhad been a light-hearted infant, fanciful, but gay and childish. After\r\nthe departure of her father, thought became impressed on her young\r\nbrow. Children, unadepts in language, seldom find words to express\r\ntheir thoughts, nor could we tell in what manner the late events had\r\nimpressed themselves on her mind. But certainly she had made deep\r\nobservations while she noted in silence the changes that passed around\r\nher. She never mentioned her father to Perdita, she appeared half\r\nafraid when she spoke of him to me, and though I tried to draw her out\r\non the subject, and to dispel the gloom that hung about her ideas\r\nconcerning him, I could not succeed. Yet each foreign post-day she\r\nwatched for the arrival of letters\xe2\x80\x94knew the post mark, and watched me\r\nas I read. I found her often poring over the article of Greek\r\nintelligence in the newspaper.\r\n\r\nThere is no more painful sight than that of untimely care in children,\r\nand it was particularly observable in one whose disposition had\r\nheretofore been mirthful. Yet there was so much sweetness and docility\r\nabout Clara, that your admiration was excited; and if the moods of mind\r\nare calculated to paint the cheek with beauty, and endow motions with\r\ngrace, surely her contemplations must have been celestial; since every\r\nlineament was moulded into loveliness, and her motions were more\r\nharmonious than the elegant boundings of the fawns of her native\r\nforest. I sometimes expostulated with Perdita on the subject of her\r\nreserve; but she rejected my counsels, while her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s sensibility\r\nexcited in her a tenderness still more passionate.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of more than a year, Adrian returned from Greece.\r\n\r\nWhen our exiles had first arrived, a truce was in existence between the\r\nTurks and Greeks; a truce that was as sleep to the mortal frame, signal\r\nof renewed activity on waking. With the numerous soldiers of Asia, with\r\nall of warlike stores, ships, and military engines, that wealth and\r\npower could command, the Turks at once resolved to crush an enemy,\r\nwhich creeping on by degrees, had from their stronghold in the Morea,\r\nacquired Thrace and Macedonia, and had led their armies even to the\r\ngates of Constantinople, while their extensive commercial relations\r\ngave every European nation an interest in their success. Greece\r\nprepared for a vigorous resistance; it rose to a man; and the women,\r\nsacrificing their costly ornaments, accoutred their sons for the war,\r\nand bade them conquer or die with the spirit of the Spartan mother. The\r\ntalents and courage of Raymond were highly esteemed among the Greeks.\r\nBorn at Athens, that city claimed him for her own, and by giving him\r\nthe command of her peculiar division in the army, the\r\ncommander-in-chief only possessed superior power. He was numbered among\r\nher citizens, his name was added to the list of Grecian heroes. His\r\njudgment, activity, and consummate bravery, justified their choice. The\r\nEarl of Windsor became a volunteer under his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9cto prate of war in these pleasant shades,\r\nand with much ill-spent oil make a show of joy, because many thousand\r\nof our fellow-creatures leave with pain this sweet air and natal earth.\r\nI shall not be suspected of being averse to the Greek cause; I know and\r\nfeel its necessity; it is beyond every other a good cause. I have\r\ndefended it with my sword, and was willing that my spirit should be\r\nbreathed out in its defence; freedom is of more worth than life, and\r\nthe Greeks do well to defend their privilege unto death. But let us not\r\ndeceive ourselves. The Turks are men; each fibre, each limb is as\r\nfeeling as our own, and every spasm, be it mental or bodily, is as\r\ntruly felt in a Turk\xe2\x80\x99s heart or brain, as in a Greek\xe2\x80\x99s. The last action\r\nat which I was present was the taking of \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. The Turks resisted to the\r\nlast, the garrison perished on the ramparts, and we entered by assault.\r\nEvery breathing creature within the walls was massacred. Think you,\r\namidst the shrieks of violated innocence and helpless infancy, I did\r\nnot feel in every nerve the cry of a fellow being? They were men and\r\nwomen, the sufferers, before they were Mahometans, and when they rise\r\nturbanless from the grave, in what except their good or evil actions\r\nwill they be the better or worse than we? Two soldiers contended for a\r\ngirl, whose rich dress and extreme beauty excited the brutal appetites\r\nof these wretches, who, perhaps good men among their families, were\r\nchanged by the fury of the moment into incarnated evils. An old man,\r\nwith a silver beard, decrepid and bald, he might be her grandfather,\r\ninterposed to save her; the battle axe of one of them clove his skull.\r\nI rushed to her defence, but rage made them blind and deaf; they did\r\nnot distinguish my Christian garb or heed my words\xe2\x80\x94words were blunt\r\nweapons then, for while war cried \xe2\x80\x9chavoc,\xe2\x80\x9d and murder gave fit echo,\r\nhow could I\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nTurn back the tide of ills, relieving wrong\r\nWith mild accost of soothing eloquence?\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the fellows, enraged at my interference, struck me with his\r\nbayonet in the side, and I fell senseless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis wound will probably shorten my life, having shattered a frame,\r\nweak of itself. But I am content to die. I have learnt in Greece that\r\none man, more or less, is of small import, while human bodies remain to\r\nfill up the thinned ranks of the soldiery; and that the identity of an\r\nindividual may be overlooked, so that the muster roll contain its full\r\nnumbers. All this has a different effect upon Raymond. He is able to\r\ncontemplate the ideal of war, while I am sensible only to its\r\nrealities. He is a soldier, a general. He can influence the\r\nblood-thirsty war-dogs, while I resist their propensities vainly. The\r\ncause is simple. Burke has said that, \xe2\x80\x98in all bodies those who would\r\nlead, must also, in a considerable degree, follow.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94I cannot follow;\r\nfor I do not sympathize in their dreams of massacre and glory\xe2\x80\x94to follow\r\nand to lead in such a career, is the natural bent of Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He\r\nis always successful, and bids fair, at the same time that he acquires\r\nhigh name and station for himself, to secure liberty, probably extended\r\nempire, to the Greeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerdita\xe2\x80\x99s mind was not softened by this account. He, she thought, can\r\nbe great and happy without me. Would that I also had a career! Would\r\nthat I could freight some untried bark with all my hopes, energies, and\r\ndesires, and launch it forth into the ocean of life\xe2\x80\x94bound for some\r\nattainable point, with ambition or pleasure at the helm! But adverse\r\nwinds detain me on shore; like Ulysses, I sit at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge and\r\nweep. But my nerveless hands can neither fell the trees, nor smooth the\r\nplanks. Under the influence of these melancholy thoughts, she became\r\nmore than ever in love with sorrow. Yet Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s presence did some\r\ngood; he at once broke through the law of silence observed concerning\r\nRaymond. At first she started from the unaccustomed sound; soon she got\r\nused to it and to love it, and she listened with avidity to the account\r\nof his achievements. Clara got rid also of her restraint; Adrian and\r\nshe had been old playfellows; and now, as they walked or rode together,\r\nhe yielded to her earnest entreaty, and repeated, for the hundredth\r\ntime, some tale of her father\xe2\x80\x99s bravery, munificence, or justice.\r\n\r\nEach vessel in the mean time brought exhilarating tidings from Greece.\r\nThe presence of a friend in its armies and councils made us enter into\r\nthe details with enthusiasm; and a short letter now and then from\r\nRaymond told us how he was engrossed by the interests of his adopted\r\ncountry. The Greeks were strongly attached to their commercial\r\npursuits, and would have been satisfied with their present\r\nacquisitions, had not the Turks roused them by invasion. The patriots\r\nwere victorious; a spirit of conquest was instilled; and already they\r\nlooked on Constantinople as their own. Raymond rose perpetually in\r\ntheir estimation; but one man held a superior command to him in their\r\narmies. He was conspicuous for his conduct and choice of position in a\r\nbattle fought in the plains of Thrace, on the banks of the Hebrus,\r\nwhich was to decide the fate of Islam. The Mahometans were defeated,\r\nand driven entirely from the country west of this river. The battle was\r\nsanguinary, the loss of the Turks apparently irreparable; the Greeks,\r\nin losing one man, forgot the nameless crowd strewed upon the bloody\r\nfield, and they ceased to value themselves on a victory, which cost\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94 Raymond.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Makri he had led the charge of cavalry, and pursued\r\nthe fugitives even to the banks of the Hebrus. His favourite horse was\r\nfound grazing by the margin of the tranquil river. It became a question\r\nwhether he had fallen among the unrecognized; but no broken ornament or\r\nstained trapping betrayed his fate. It was suspected that the Turks,\r\nfinding themselves possessed of so illustrious a captive, resolved to\r\nsatisfy their cruelty rather than their avarice, and fearful of the\r\ninterference of England, had come to the determination of concealing\r\nfor ever the cold-blooded murder of the soldier they most hated and\r\nfeared in the squadrons of their enemy.\r\n\r\nRaymond was not forgotten in England. His abdication of the\r\nProtectorate had caused an unexampled sensation; and, when his\r\nmagnificent and manly system was contrasted with the narrow views of\r\nsucceeding politicians, the period of his elevation was referred to\r\nwith sorrow. The perpetual recurrence of his name, joined to most\r\nhonourable testimonials, in the Greek gazettes, kept up the interest he\r\nhad excited. He seemed the favourite child of fortune, and his untimely\r\nloss eclipsed the world, and shewed forth the remnant of mankind with\r\ndiminished lustre. They clung with eagerness to the hope held out that\r\nhe might yet be alive. Their minister at Constantinople was urged to\r\nmake the necessary perquisitions, and should his existence be\r\nascertained, to demand his release. It was to be hoped that their\r\nefforts would succeed, and that though now a prisoner, the sport of\r\ncruelty and the mark of hate, he would be rescued from danger and\r\nrestored to the happiness, power, and honour which he deserved.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this intelligence upon my sister was striking. She never\r\nfor a moment credited the story of his death; she resolved instantly to\r\ngo to Greece. Reasoning and persuasion were thrown away upon her; she\r\nwould endure no hindrance, no delay. It may be advanced for a truth,\r\nthat, if argument or entreaty can turn any one from a desperate\r\npurpose, whose motive and end depends on the strength of the affections\r\nonly, then it is right so to turn them, since their docility shews,\r\nthat neither the motive nor the end were of sufficient force to bear\r\nthem through the obstacles attendant on their undertaking. If, on the\r\ncontrary, they are proof against expostulation, this very steadiness is\r\nan omen of success; and it becomes the duty of those who love them, to\r\nassist in smoothing the obstructions in their path. Such sentiments\r\nactuated our little circle. Finding Perdita immoveable, we consulted as\r\nto the best means of furthering her purpose. She could not go alone to\r\na country where she had no friends, where she might arrive only to hear\r\nthe dreadful news, which must overwhelm her with grief and remorse.\r\nAdrian, whose health had always been weak, now suffered considerable\r\naggravation of suffering from the effects of his wound. Idris could not\r\nendure to leave him in this state; nor was it right either to quit or\r\ntake with us a young family for a journey of this description. I\r\nresolved at length to accompany Perdita. The separation from my Idris\r\nwas painful\xe2\x80\x94but necessity reconciled us to it in some degree: necessity\r\nand the hope of saving Raymond, and restoring him again to happiness\r\nand Perdita. No delay was to ensue. Two days after we came to our\r\ndetermination, we set out for Portsmouth, and embarked. The season was\r\nMay, the weather stormless; we were promised a prosperous voyage.\r\nCherishing the most fervent hopes, embarked on the waste ocean, we saw\r\nwith delight the receding shore of Britain, and on the wings of desire\r\noutspeeded our well filled sails towards the South. The light curling\r\nwaves bore us onward, and old ocean smiled at the freight of love and\r\nhope committed to his charge; it stroked gently its tempestuous plains,\r\nand the path was smoothed for us. Day and night the wind right aft,\r\ngave steady impulse to our keel\xe2\x80\x94nor did rough gale, or treacherous\r\nsand, or destructive rock interpose an obstacle between my sister and\r\nthe land which was to restore her to her first beloved,\r\n\r\nHer dear heart\xe2\x80\x99s confessor\xe2\x80\x94a heart within that heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOL. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this voyage, when on calm evenings we conversed on deck,\r\nwatching the glancing of the waves and the changeful appearances of the\r\nsky, I discovered the total revolution that the disasters of Raymond\r\nhad wrought in the mind of my sister. Were they the same waters of\r\nlove, which, lately cold and cutting as ice, repelling as that, now\r\nloosened from their frozen chains, flowed through the regions of her\r\nsoul in gushing and grateful exuberance? She did not believe that he\r\nwas dead, but she knew that he was in danger, and the hope of assisting\r\nin his liberation, and the idea of soothing by tenderness the ills that\r\nhe might have undergone, elevated and harmonized the late jarring\r\nelement of her being. I was not so sanguine as she as to the result of\r\nour voyage. She was not sanguine, but secure; and the expectation of\r\nseeing the lover she had banished, the husband, friend, heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion from whom she had long been alienated, wrapt her senses in\r\ndelight, her mind in placidity. It was beginning life again; it was\r\nleaving barren sands for an abode of fertile beauty; it was a harbour\r\nafter a tempest, an opiate after sleepless nights, a happy waking from\r\na terrible dream.\r\n\r\nLittle Clara accompanied us; the poor child did not well understand\r\nwhat was going forward. She heard that we were bound for Greece, that\r\nshe would see her father, and now, for the first time, she prattled of\r\nhim to her mother.\r\n\r\nOn landing at Athens we found difficulties encrease upon us: nor could\r\nthe storied earth or balmy atmosphere inspire us with enthusiasm or\r\npleasure, while the fate of Raymond was in jeopardy. No man had ever\r\nexcited so strong an interest in the public mind; this was apparent\r\neven among the phlegmatic English, from whom he had long been absent.\r\nThe Athenians had expected their hero to return in triumph; the women\r\nhad taught their children to lisp his name joined to thanksgiving; his\r\nmanly beauty, his courage, his devotion to their cause, made him appear\r\nin their eyes almost as one of the ancient deities of the soil\r\ndescended from their native Olympus to defend them. When they spoke of\r\nhis probable death and certain captivity, tears streamed from their\r\neyes; even as the women of Syria sorrowed for Adonis, did the wives and\r\nmothers of Greece lament our English Raymond\xe2\x80\x94Athens was a city of\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\nAll these shews of despair struck Perdita with affright. With that\r\nsanguine but confused expectation, which desire engendered while she\r\nwas at a distance from reality, she had formed an image in her mind of\r\ninstantaneous change, when she should set her foot on Grecian shores.\r\nShe fancied that Raymond would already be free, and that her tender\r\nattentions would come to entirely obliterate even the memory of his\r\nmischance. But his fate was still uncertain; she began to fear the\r\nworst, and to feel that her soul\xe2\x80\x99s hope was cast on a chance that might\r\nprove a blank. The wife and lovely child of Lord Raymond became objects\r\nof intense interest in Athens. The gates of their abode were besieged,\r\naudible prayers were breathed for his restoration; all these\r\ncircumstances added to the dismay and fears of Perdita.\r\n\r\nMy exertions were unremitted: after a time I left Athens, and joined\r\nthe army stationed at Kishan in Thrace. Bribery, threats, and intrigue,\r\nsoon discovered the secret that Raymond was alive, a prisoner,\r\nsuffering the most rigorous confinement and wanton cruelties. We put in\r\nmovement every impulse of policy and money to redeem him from their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe impatience of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s disposition now returned on her, awakened\r\nby repentance, sharpened by remorse. The very beauty of the Grecian\r\nclimate, during the season of spring, added torture to her sensations.\r\nThe unexampled loveliness of the flower-clad earth\xe2\x80\x94the genial sunshine\r\nand grateful shade\xe2\x80\x94the melody of the birds\xe2\x80\x94the majesty of the woods\xe2\x80\x94\r\nthe splendour of the marble ruins\xe2\x80\x94the clear effulgence of the stars by\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94the combination of all that was exciting and voluptuous in this\r\ntranscending land, by inspiring a quicker spirit of life and an added\r\nsensitiveness to every articulation of her frame, only gave edge to the\r\npoignancy of her grief. Each long hour was counted, and \xe2\x80\x9c_He suffers_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas the burthen of all her thoughts. She abstained from food; she lay\r\non the bare earth, and, by such mimickry of his enforced torments,\r\nendeavoured to hold communion with his distant pain. I remembered in\r\none of her harshest moments a quotation of mine had roused her to anger\r\nand disdain. \xe2\x80\x9cPerdita,\xe2\x80\x9d I had said, \xe2\x80\x9csome day you will discover that\r\nyou have done wrong in again casting Raymond on the thorns of life.\r\nWhen disappointment has sullied his beauty, when a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s hardships\r\nhave bent his manly form, and loneliness made even triumph bitter to\r\nhim, then you will repent; and regret for the irreparable change\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwill move\r\n        In hearts all rocky now, the late remorse of love.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stinging \xe2\x80\x9cremorse of love\xe2\x80\x9d now pierced her heart. She accused\r\nherself of his journey to Greece\xe2\x80\x94his dangers\xe2\x80\x94his imprisonment. She\r\npictured to herself the anguish of his solitude; she remembered with\r\nwhat eager delight he had in former days made her the partner of his\r\njoyful hopes\xe2\x80\x94 with what grateful affection he received her sympathy in\r\nhis cares. She called to mind how often he had declared that solitude\r\nwas to him the greatest of all evils, and how death itself was to him\r\nmore full of fear and pain when he pictured to himself a lonely grave.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy best girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said, \xe2\x80\x9crelieves me from these phantasies. United\r\nto her, cherished in her dear heart, never again shall I know the\r\nmisery of finding myself alone. Even if I die before you, my Perdita,\r\ntreasure up my ashes till yours may mingle with mine. It is a foolish\r\nsentiment for one who is not a materialist, yet, methinks, even in that\r\ndark cell, I may feel that my inanimate dust mingles with yours, and\r\nthus have a companion in decay.\xe2\x80\x9d In her resentful mood, these\r\nexpressions had been remembered with acrimony and disdain; they visited\r\nher in her softened hour, taking sleep from her eyes, all hope of rest\r\nfrom her uneasy mind.\r\n\r\nTwo months passed thus, when at last we obtained a promise of Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelease. Confinement and hardship had undermined his health; the Turks\r\nfeared an accomplishment of the threats of the English government, if\r\nhe died under their hands; they looked upon his recovery as impossible;\r\nthey delivered him up as a dying man, willingly making over to us the\r\nrites of burial.\r\n\r\nHe came by sea from Constantinople to Athens. The wind, favourable to\r\nhim, blew so strongly in shore, that we were unable, as we had at first\r\nintended, to meet him on his watery road. The watchtower of Athens was\r\nbesieged by inquirers, each sail eagerly looked out for; till on the\r\nfirst of May the gallant frigate bore in sight, freighted with treasure\r\nmore invaluable than the wealth which, piloted from Mexico, the vexed\r\nPacific swallowed, or that was conveyed over its tranquil bosom to\r\nenrich the crown of Spain. At early dawn the vessel was discovered\r\nbearing in shore; it was conjectured that it would cast anchor about\r\nfive miles from land. The news spread through Athens, and the whole\r\ncity poured out at the gate of the Piraeus, down the roads, through the\r\nvineyards, the olive woods and plantations of fig-trees, towards the\r\nharbour. The noisy joy of the populace, the gaudy colours of their\r\ndress, the tumult of carriages and horses, the march of soldiers\r\nintermixed, the waving of banners and sound of martial music added to\r\nthe high excitement of the scene; while round us reposed in solemn\r\nmajesty the relics of antient time. To our right the Acropolis rose\r\nhigh, spectatress of a thousand changes, of ancient glory, Turkish\r\nslavery, and the restoration of dear-bought liberty; tombs and\r\ncenotaphs were strewed thick around, adorned by ever renewing\r\nvegetation; the mighty dead hovered over their monuments, and beheld in\r\nour enthusiasm and congregated numbers a renewal of the scenes in which\r\nthey had been the actors. Perdita and Clara rode in a close carriage; I\r\nattended them on horseback. At length we arrived at the harbour; it was\r\nagitated by the outward swell of the sea; the beach, as far could be\r\ndiscerned, was covered by a moving multitude, which, urged by those\r\nbehind toward the sea, again rushed back as the heavy waves with sullen\r\nroar burst close to them. I applied my glass, and could discern that\r\nthe frigate had already cast anchor, fearful of the danger of\r\napproaching nearer to a lee shore: a boat was lowered; with a pang I\r\nsaw that Raymond was unable to descend the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s side; he was let\r\ndown in a chair, and lay wrapt in cloaks at the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\nI dismounted, and called to some sailors who were rowing about the\r\nharbour to pull up, and take me into their skiff; Perdita at the same\r\nmoment alighted from her carriage\xe2\x80\x94she seized my arm\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTake me with you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe cried; she was trembling and pale; Clara clung to her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nnot,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sea is rough\xe2\x80\x94he will soon be here\xe2\x80\x94do you not see his\r\nboat?\xe2\x80\x9d The little bark to which I had beckoned had now pulled up;\r\nbefore I could stop her, Perdita, assisted by the sailors was in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94Clara followed her mother\xe2\x80\x94a loud shout echoed from the crowd as we\r\npulled out of the inner harbour; while my sister at the prow, had\r\ncaught hold of one of the men who was using a glass, asking a thousand\r\nquestions, careless of the spray that broke over her, deaf, sightless\r\nto all, except the little speck that, just visible on the top of the\r\nwaves, evidently neared. We approached with all the speed six rowers\r\ncould give; the orderly and picturesque dress of the soldiers on the\r\nbeach, the sounds of exulting music, the stirring breeze and waving\r\nflags, the unchecked exclamations of the eager crowd, whose dark looks\r\nand foreign garb were purely eastern; the sight of temple-crowned rock,\r\nthe white marble of the buildings glittering in the sun, and standing\r\nin bright relief against the dark ridge of lofty mountains beyond; the\r\nnear roar of the sea, the splash of oars, and dash of spray, all\r\nsteeped my soul in a delirium, unfelt, unimagined in the common course\r\nof common life. Trembling, I was unable to continue to look through the\r\nglass with which I had watched the motion of the crew, when the\r\nfrigate\xe2\x80\x99s boat had first been launched. We rapidly drew near, so that\r\nat length the number and forms of those within could be discerned; its\r\ndark sides grew big, and the splash of its oars became audible: I could\r\ndistinguish the languid form of my friend, as he half raised himself at\r\nour approach.\r\n\r\nPerdita\xe2\x80\x99s questions had ceased; she leaned on my arm, panting with\r\nemotions too acute for tears\xe2\x80\x94our men pulled alongside the other boat.\r\nAs a last effort, my sister mustered her strength, her firmness; she\r\nstepped from one boat to the other, and then with a shriek she sprang\r\ntowards Raymond, knelt at his side, and glueing her lips to the hand\r\nshe seized, her face shrouded by her long hair, gave herself up to\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nRaymond had somewhat raised himself at our approach, but it was with\r\ndifficulty that he exerted himself even thus much. With sunken cheek\r\nand hollow eyes, pale and gaunt, how could I recognize the beloved of\r\nPerdita? I continued awe-struck and mute\xe2\x80\x94he looked smilingly on the\r\npoor girl; the smile was his. A day of sun-shine falling on a dark\r\nvalley, displays its before hidden characteristics; and now this smile,\r\nthe same with which he first spoke love to Perdita, with which he had\r\nwelcomed the protectorate, playing on his altered countenance, made me\r\nin my heart\xe2\x80\x99s core feel that this was Raymond.\r\n\r\nHe stretched out to me his other hand; I discerned the trace of\r\nmanacles on his bared wrist. I heard my sister\xe2\x80\x99s sobs, and thought,\r\nhappy are women who can weep, and in a passionate caress disburthen the\r\noppression of their feelings; shame and habitual restraint hold back a\r\nman. I would have given worlds to have acted as in days of boyhood,\r\nhave strained him to my breast, pressed his hand to my lips, and wept\r\nover him; my swelling heart choked me; the natural current would not be\r\nchecked; the big rebellious tears gathered in my eyes; I turned aside,\r\nand they dropped in the sea\xe2\x80\x94they came fast and faster;\xe2\x80\x94yet I could\r\nhardly be ashamed, for I saw that the rough sailors were not unmoved,\r\nand Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s eyes alone were dry from among our crew. He lay in that\r\nblessed calm which convalescence always induces, enjoying in secure\r\ntranquillity his liberty and re-union with her whom he adored. Perdita\r\nat length subdued her burst of passion, and rose, \xe2\x80\x94she looked round for\r\nClara; the child frightened, not recognizing her father, and neglected\r\nby us, had crept to the other end of the boat; she came at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncall. Perdita presented her to Raymond; her first words were: \xe2\x80\x9cBeloved,\r\nembrace our child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome hither, sweet one,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you not know me?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nknew his voice, and cast herself in his arms with half bashful but\r\nuncontrollable emotion.\r\n\r\nPerceiving the weakness of Raymond, I was afraid of ill consequences\r\nfrom the pressure of the crowd on his landing. But they were awed as I\r\nhad been, at the change of his appearance. The music died away, the\r\nshouts abruptly ended; the soldiers had cleared a space in which a\r\ncarriage was drawn up. He was placed in it; Perdita and Clara entered\r\nwith him, and his escort closed round it; a hollow murmur, akin to the\r\nroaring of the near waves, went through the multitude; they fell back\r\nas the carriage advanced, and fearful of injuring him they had come to\r\nwelcome, by loud testimonies of joy, they satisfied themselves with\r\nbending in a low salaam as the carriage passed; it went slowly along\r\nthe road of the Piraeus; passed by antique temple and heroic tomb,\r\nbeneath the craggy rock of the citadel. The sound of the waves was left\r\nbehind; that of the multitude continued at intervals, supressed and\r\nhoarse; and though, in the city, the houses, churches, and public\r\nbuildings were decorated with tapestry and banners\xe2\x80\x94though the soldiery\r\nlined the streets, and the inhabitants in thousands were assembled to\r\ngive him hail, the same solemn silence prevailed, the soldiery\r\npresented arms, the banners vailed, many a white hand waved a streamer,\r\nand vainly sought to discern the hero in the vehicle, which, closed and\r\nencompassed by the city guards, drew him to the palace allotted for his\r\nabode.\r\n\r\nRaymond was weak and exhausted, yet the interest he perceived to be\r\nexcited on his account, filled him with proud pleasure. He was nearly\r\nkilled with kindness. It is true, the populace retained themselves; but\r\nthere arose a perpetual hum and bustle from the throng round the\r\npalace, which added to the noise of fireworks, the frequent explosion\r\nof arms, the tramp to and fro of horsemen and carriages, to which\r\neffervescence he was the focus, retarded his recovery. So we retired\r\nawhile to Eleusis, and here rest and tender care added each day to the\r\nstrength of our invalid. The zealous attention of Perdita claimed the\r\nfirst rank in the causes which induced his rapid recovery; but the\r\nsecond was surely the delight he felt in the affection and good will of\r\nthe Greeks. We are said to love much those whom we greatly benefit.\r\nRaymond had fought and conquered for the Athenians; he had suffered, on\r\ntheir account, peril, imprisonment, and hardship; their gratitude\r\naffected him deeply, and he inly vowed to unite his fate for ever to\r\nthat of a people so enthusiastically devoted to him.\r\n\r\nSocial feeling and sympathy constituted a marked feature in my\r\ndisposition. In early youth, the living drama acted around me, drew me\r\nheart and soul into its vortex. I was now conscious of a change. I\r\nloved, I hoped, I enjoyed; but there was something besides this. I was\r\ninquisitive as to the internal principles of action of those around me:\r\nanxious to read their thoughts justly, and for ever occupied in\r\ndivining their inmost mind. All events, at the same time that they\r\ndeeply interested me, arranged themselves in pictures before me. I gave\r\nthe right place to every personage in the groupe, the just balance to\r\nevery sentiment. This undercurrent of thought, often soothed me amidst\r\ndistress, and even agony. It gave ideality to that, from which, taken\r\nin naked truth, the soul would have revolted: it bestowed pictorial\r\ncolours on misery and disease, and not unfrequently relieved me from\r\ndespair in deplorable changes. This faculty, or instinct, was now\r\nrouzed. I watched the re-awakened devotion of my sister; Clara\xe2\x80\x99s timid,\r\nbut concentrated admiration of her father, and Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for\r\nrenown, and sensitiveness to the demonstrations of affection of the\r\nAthenians. Attentively perusing this animated volume, I was the less\r\nsurprised at the tale I read on the new-turned page.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish army were at this time besieging Rodosto; and the Greeks,\r\nhastening their preparations, and sending each day reinforcements, were\r\non the eve of forcing the enemy to battle. Each people looked on the\r\ncoming struggle as that which would be to a great degree decisive; as,\r\nin case of victory, the next step would be the siege of Constantinople\r\nby the Greeks. Raymond, being somewhat recovered, prepared to re-assume\r\nhis command in the army.\r\n\r\nPerdita did not oppose herself to his determination. She only\r\nstipulated to be permitted to accompany him. She had set down no rule\r\nof conduct for herself; but for her life she could not have opposed his\r\nslightest wish, or do other than acquiesce cheerfully in all his\r\nprojects. One word, in truth, had alarmed her more than battles or\r\nsieges, during which she trusted Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s high command would exempt\r\nhim from danger. That word, as yet it was not more to her, was PLAGUE.\r\nThis enemy to the human race had begun early in June to raise its\r\nserpent-head on the shores of the Nile; parts of Asia, not usually\r\nsubject to this evil, were infected. It was in Constantinople; but as\r\neach year that city experienced a like visitation, small attention was\r\npaid to those accounts which declared more people to have died there\r\nalready, than usually made up the accustomed prey of the whole of the\r\nhotter months. However it might be, neither plague nor war could\r\nprevent Perdita from following her lord, or induce her to utter one\r\nobjection to the plans which he proposed. To be near him, to be loved\r\nby him, to feel him again her own, was the limit of her desires. The\r\nobject of her life was to do him pleasure: it had been so before, but\r\nwith a difference. In past times, without thought or foresight she had\r\nmade him happy, being so herself, and in any question of choice,\r\nconsulted her own wishes, as being one with his. Now she sedulously put\r\nherself out of the question, sacrificing even her anxiety for his\r\nhealth and welfare to her resolve not to oppose any of his desires.\r\nLove of the Greek people, appetite for glory, and hatred of the\r\nbarbarian government under which he had suffered even to the approach\r\nof death, stimulated him. He wished to repay the kindness of the\r\nAthenians, to keep alive the splendid associations connected with his\r\nname, and to eradicate from Europe a power which, while every other\r\nnation advanced in civilization, stood still, a monument of antique\r\nbarbarism. Having effected the reunion of Raymond and Perdita, I was\r\neager to return to England; but his earnest request, added to awakening\r\ncuriosity, and an indefinable anxiety to behold the catastrophe, now\r\napparently at hand, in the long drawn history of Grecian and Turkish\r\nwarfare, induced me to consent to prolong until the autumn, the period\r\nof my residence in Greece.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the health of Raymond was sufficiently re-established, he\r\nprepared to join the Grecian camp, near Kishan, a town of some\r\nimportance, situated to the east of the Hebrus; in which Perdita and\r\nClara were to remain until the event of the expected battle. We quitted\r\nAthens on the 2nd of June. Raymond had recovered from the gaunt and\r\npallid looks of fever. If I no longer saw the fresh glow of youth on\r\nhis matured countenance, if care had besieged his brow,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd dug deep trenches in his beauty\xe2\x80\x99s field,\xe2\x80\x9d[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nif his hair, slightly mingled with grey, and his look, considerate even\r\nin its eagerness, gave signs of added years and past sufferings, yet\r\nthere was something irresistibly affecting in the sight of one, lately\r\nsnatched from the grave, renewing his career, untamed by sickness or\r\ndisaster. The Athenians saw in him, not as heretofore, the heroic boy\r\nor desperate man, who was ready to die for them; but the prudent\r\ncommander, who for their sakes was careful of his life, and could make\r\nhis own warrior-propensities second to the scheme of conduct policy\r\nmight point out.\r\n\r\nAll Athens accompanied us for several miles. When he had landed a month\r\nago, the noisy populace had been hushed by sorrow and fear; but this\r\nwas a festival day to all. The air resounded with their shouts; their\r\npicturesque costume, and the gay colours of which it was composed,\r\nflaunted in the sunshine; their eager gestures and rapid utterance\r\naccorded with their wild appearance. Raymond was the theme of every\r\ntongue, the hope of each wife, mother or betrothed bride, whose\r\nhusband, child, or lover, making a part of the Greek army, were to be\r\nconducted to victory by him.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the hazardous object of our journey, it was full of\r\nromantic interest, as we passed through the vallies, and over the\r\nhills, of this divine country. Raymond was inspirited by the intense\r\nsensations of recovered health; he felt that in being general of the\r\nAthenians, he filled a post worthy of his ambition; and, in his hope of\r\nthe conquest of Constantinople, he counted on an event which would be\r\nas a landmark in the waste of ages, an exploit unequalled in the annals\r\nof man; when a city of grand historic association, the beauty of whose\r\nsite was the wonder of the world, which for many hundred years had been\r\nthe strong hold of the Moslems, should be rescued from slavery and\r\nbarbarism, and restored to a people illustrious for genius,\r\ncivilization, and a spirit of liberty. Perdita rested on his restored\r\nsociety, on his love, his hopes and fame, even as a Sybarite on a\r\nluxurious couch; every thought was transport, each emotion bathed as it\r\nwere in a congenial and balmy element.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Kishan on the 7th of July. The weather during our journey\r\nhad been serene. Each day, before dawn, we left our night\xe2\x80\x99s encampment,\r\nand watched the shadows as they retreated from hill and valley, and the\r\ngolden splendour of the sun\xe2\x80\x99s approach. The accompanying soldiers\r\nreceived, with national vivacity, enthusiastic pleasure from the sight\r\nof beautiful nature. The uprising of the star of day was hailed by\r\ntriumphant strains, while the birds, heard by snatches, filled up the\r\nintervals of the music. At noon, we pitched our tents in some shady\r\nvalley, or embowering wood among the mountains, while a stream\r\nprattling over pebbles induced grateful sleep. Our evening march, more\r\ncalm, was yet more delightful than the morning restlessness of spirit.\r\nIf the band played, involuntarily they chose airs of moderated passion;\r\nthe farewell of love, or lament at absence, was followed and closed by\r\nsome solemn hymn, which harmonized with the tranquil loveliness of\r\nevening, and elevated the soul to grand and religious thought. Often\r\nall sounds were suspended, that we might listen to the nightingale,\r\nwhile the fire-flies danced in bright measure, and the soft cooing of\r\nthe aziolo spoke of fair weather to the travellers. Did we pass a\r\nvalley? Soft shades encompassed us, and rocks tinged with beauteous\r\nhues. If we traversed a mountain, Greece, a living map, was spread\r\nbeneath, her renowned pinnacles cleaving the ether; her rivers\r\nthreading in silver line the fertile land. Afraid almost to breathe, we\r\nEnglish travellers surveyed with extasy this splendid landscape, so\r\ndifferent from the sober hues and melancholy graces of our native\r\nscenery. When we quitted Macedonia, the fertile but low plains of\r\nThrace afforded fewer beauties; yet our journey continued to be\r\ninteresting. An advanced guard gave information of our approach, and\r\nthe country people were quickly in motion to do honour to Lord Raymond.\r\nThe villages were decorated by triumphal arches of greenery by day, and\r\nlamps by night; tapestry waved from the windows, the ground was strewed\r\nwith flowers, and the name of Raymond, joined to that of Greece, was\r\nechoed in the _Evive_ of the peasant crowd.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Kishan, we learnt, that on hearing of the advance of\r\nLord Raymond and his detachment, the Turkish army had retreated from\r\nRodosto; but meeting with a reinforcement, they had re-trod their\r\nsteps. In the meantime, Argyropylo, the Greek commander-in-chief, had\r\nadvanced, so as to be between the Turks and Rodosto; a battle, it was\r\nsaid, was inevitable. Perdita and her child were to remain at Kishan.\r\nRaymond asked me, if I would not continue with them. \xe2\x80\x9cNow by the fells\r\nof Cumberland,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cby all of the vagabond and poacher that\r\nappertains to me, I will stand at your side, draw my sword in the Greek\r\ncause, and be hailed as a victor along with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the plain, from Kishan to Rodosto, a distance of sixteen leagues,\r\nwas alive with troops, or with the camp-followers, all in motion at the\r\napproach of a battle. The small garrisons were drawn from the various\r\ntowns and fortresses, and went to swell the main army. We met baggage\r\nwaggons, and many females of high and low rank returning to Fairy or\r\nKishan, there to wait the issue of the expected day. When we arrived at\r\nRodosto, we found that the field had been taken, and the scheme of the\r\nbattle arranged. The sound of firing, early on the following morning,\r\ninformed us that advanced posts of the armies were engaged. Regiment\r\nafter regiment advanced, their colours flying and bands playing. They\r\nplanted the cannon on the tumuli, sole elevations in this level\r\ncountry, and formed themselves into column and hollow square; while the\r\npioneers threw up small mounds for their protection.\r\n\r\nThese then were the preparations for a battle, nay, the battle itself;\r\nfar different from any thing the imagination had pictured. We read of\r\ncentre and wing in Greek and Roman history; we fancy a spot, plain as a\r\ntable, and soldiers small as chessmen; and drawn forth, so that the\r\nmost ignorant of the game can discover science and order in the\r\ndisposition of the forces. When I came to the reality, and saw\r\nregiments file off to the left far out of sight, fields intervening\r\nbetween the battalions, but a few troops sufficiently near me to\r\nobserve their motions, I gave up all idea of understanding, even of\r\nseeing a battle, but attaching myself to Raymond attended with intense\r\ninterest to his actions. He shewed himself collected, gallant and\r\nimperial; his commands were prompt, his intuition of the events of the\r\nday to me miraculous. In the mean time the cannon roared; the music\r\nlifted up its enlivening voice at intervals; and we on the highest of\r\nthe mounds I mentioned, too far off to observe the fallen sheaves which\r\ndeath gathered into his storehouse, beheld the regiments, now lost in\r\nsmoke, now banners and staves peering above the cloud, while shout and\r\nclamour drowned every sound.\r\n\r\nEarly in the day, Argyropylo was wounded dangerously, and Raymond\r\nassumed the command of the whole army. He made few remarks, till, on\r\nobserving through his glass the sequel of an order he had given, his\r\nface, clouded for awhile with doubt, became radiant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe day is ours,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Turks fly from the bayonet.\xe2\x80\x9d And then swiftly he\r\ndispatched his aides-de-camp to command the horse to fall on the routed\r\nenemy. The defeat became total; the cannon ceased to roar; the infantry\r\nrallied, and horse pursued the flying Turks along the dreary plain; the\r\nstaff of Raymond was dispersed in various directions, to make\r\nobservations, and bear commands. Even I was dispatched to a distant\r\npart of the field.\r\n\r\nThe ground on which the battle was fought, was a level plain\xe2\x80\x94so level,\r\nthat from the tumuli you saw the waving line of mountains on the\r\nwide-stretched horizon; yet the intervening space was unvaried by the\r\nleast irregularity, save such undulations as resembled the waves of the\r\nsea. The whole of this part of Thrace had been so long a scene of\r\ncontest, that it had remained uncultivated, and presented a dreary,\r\nbarren appearance. The order I had received, was to make an observation\r\nof the direction which a detachment of the enemy might have taken, from\r\na northern tumulus; the whole Turkish army, followed by the Greek, had\r\npoured eastward; none but the dead remained in the direction of my\r\nside. From the top of the mound, I looked far round\xe2\x80\x94all was silent and\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nThe last beams of the nearly sunken sun shot up from behind the far\r\nsummit of Mount Athos; the sea of Marmora still glittered beneath its\r\nrays, while the Asiatic coast beyond was half hid in a haze of low\r\ncloud. Many a casque, and bayonet, and sword, fallen from unnerved\r\narms, reflected the departing ray; they lay scattered far and near.\r\nFrom the east, a band of ravens, old inhabitants of the Turkish\r\ncemeteries, came sailing along towards their harvest; the sun\r\ndisappeared. This hour, melancholy yet sweet, has always seemed to me\r\nthe time when we are most naturally led to commune with higher powers;\r\nour mortal sternness departs, and gentle complacency invests the soul.\r\nBut now, in the midst of the dying and the dead, how could a thought of\r\nheaven or a sensation of tranquillity possess one of the murderers?\r\nDuring the busy day, my mind had yielded itself a willing slave to the\r\nstate of things presented to it by its fellow-beings; historical\r\nassociation, hatred of the foe, and military enthusiasm had held\r\ndominion over me. Now, I looked on the evening star, as softly and\r\ncalmly it hung pendulous in the orange hues of sunset. I turned to the\r\ncorse-strewn earth; and felt ashamed of my species. So perhaps were the\r\nplacid skies; for they quickly veiled themselves in mist, and in this\r\nchange assisted the swift disappearance of twilight usual in the south;\r\nheavy masses of cloud floated up from the south east, and red and\r\nturbid lightning shot from their dark edges; the rushing wind disturbed\r\nthe garments of the dead, and was chilled as it passed over their icy\r\nforms. Darkness gathered round; the objects about me became indistinct,\r\nI descended from my station, and with difficulty guided my horse, so as\r\nto avoid the slain.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard a piercing shriek; a form seemed to rise from the\r\nearth; it flew swiftly towards me, sinking to the ground again as it\r\ndrew near. All this passed so suddenly, that I with difficulty reined\r\nin my horse, so that it should not trample on the prostrate being. The\r\ndress of this person was that of a soldier, but the bared neck and\r\narms, and the continued shrieks discovered a female thus disguised. I\r\ndismounted to her aid, while she, with heavy groans, and her hand\r\nplaced on her side, resisted my attempt to lead her on. In the hurry of\r\nthe moment I forgot that I was in Greece, and in my native accents\r\nendeavoured to soothe the sufferer. With wild and terrific exclamations\r\ndid the lost, dying Evadne (for it was she) recognize the language of\r\nher lover; pain and fever from her wound had deranged her intellects,\r\nwhile her piteous cries and feeble efforts to escape, penetrated me\r\nwith compassion. In wild delirium she called upon the name of Raymond;\r\nshe exclaimed that I was keeping him from her, while the Turks with\r\nfearful instruments of torture were about to take his life. Then again\r\nshe sadly lamented her hard fate; that a woman, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nand sensibility, should be driven by hopeless love and vacant hopes to\r\ntake up the trade of arms, and suffer beyond the endurance of man\r\nprivation, labour, and pain\xe2\x80\x94the while her dry, hot hand pressed mine,\r\nand her brow and lips burned with consuming fire.\r\n\r\nAs her strength grew less, I lifted her from the ground; her emaciated\r\nform hung over my arm, her sunken cheek rested on my breast; in a\r\nsepulchral voice she murmured:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the end of love!\xe2\x80\x94Yet not the\r\nend!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 and frenzy lent her strength as she cast her arm up to heaven:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere is the end! there we meet again. Many living deaths have I borne\r\nfor thee, O Raymond, and now I expire, thy victim!\xe2\x80\x94By my death I\r\npurchase thee\xe2\x80\x94 lo! the instruments of war, fire, the plague are my\r\nservitors. I dared, I conquered them all, till now! I have sold myself\r\nto death, with the sole condition that thou shouldst follow me\xe2\x80\x94Fire,\r\nand war, and plague, unite for thy destruction\xe2\x80\x94O my Raymond, there is\r\nno safety for thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith an heavy heart I listened to the changes of her delirium; I made\r\nher a bed of cloaks; her violence decreased and a clammy dew stood on\r\nher brow as the paleness of death succeeded to the crimson of fever, I\r\nplaced her on the cloaks. She continued to rave of her speedy meeting\r\nwith her beloved in the grave, of his death nigh at hand; sometimes she\r\nsolemnly declared that he was summoned; sometimes she bewailed his hard\r\ndestiny. Her voice grew feebler, her speech interrupted; a few\r\nconvulsive movements, and her muscles relaxed, the limbs fell, no more\r\nto be sustained, one deep sigh, and life was gone.\r\n\r\nI bore her from the near neighbourhood of the dead; wrapt in cloaks, I\r\nplaced her beneath a tree. Once more I looked on her altered face; the\r\nlast time I saw her she was eighteen; beautiful as poet\xe2\x80\x99s vision,\r\nsplendid as a Sultana of the East\xe2\x80\x94Twelve years had past; twelve years\r\nof change, sorrow and hardship; her brilliant complexion had become\r\nworn and dark, her limbs had lost the roundness of youth and womanhood;\r\nher eyes had sunk deep,\r\n\r\n        Crushed and o\xe2\x80\x99erworn,\r\nThe hours had drained her blood, and filled her brow\r\nWith lines and wrinkles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith shuddering horror I veiled this monument of human passion and\r\nhuman misery; I heaped over her all of flags and heavy accoutrements I\r\ncould find, to guard her from birds and beasts of prey, until I could\r\nbestow on her a fitting grave. Sadly and slowly I stemmed my course\r\nfrom among the heaps of slain, and, guided by the twinkling lights of\r\nthe town, at length reached Rodosto.\r\n\r\n [1] Lord Byron\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Canto of Childe Harolde.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Shakspeare\xe2\x80\x99s Sonnets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my arrival, I found that an order had already gone forth for the\r\narmy to proceed immediately towards Constantinople; and the troops\r\nwhich had suffered least in the battle were already on their way. The\r\ntown was full of tumult. The wound, and consequent inability of\r\nArgyropylo, caused Raymond to be the first in command. He rode through\r\nthe town, visiting the wounded, and giving such orders as were\r\nnecessary for the siege he meditated. Early in the morning the whole\r\narmy was in motion. In the hurry I could hardly find an opportunity to\r\nbestow the last offices on Evadne. Attended only by my servant, I dug a\r\ndeep grave for her at the foot of the tree, and without disturbing her\r\nwarrior shroud, I placed her in it, heaping stones upon the grave. The\r\ndazzling sun and glare of daylight, deprived the scene of solemnity;\r\nfrom Evadne\xe2\x80\x99s low tomb, I joined Raymond and his staff, now on their\r\nway to the Golden City.\r\n\r\nConstantinople was invested, trenches dug, and advances made. The whole\r\nGreek fleet blockaded it by sea; on land from the river Kyat Kbanah,\r\nnear the Sweet Waters, to the Tower of Marmora, on the shores of the\r\nPropontis, along the whole line of the ancient walls, the trenches of\r\nthe siege were drawn. We already possessed Pera; the Golden Horn\r\nitself, the city, bastioned by the sea, and the ivy-mantled walls of\r\nthe Greek emperors was all of Europe that the Mahometans could call\r\ntheirs. Our army looked on her as certain prey. They counted the\r\ngarrison; it was impossible that it should be relieved; each sally was\r\na victory; for, even when the Turks were triumphant, the loss of men\r\nthey sustained was an irreparable injury. I rode one morning with\r\nRaymond to the lofty mound, not far from the Top Kapou, (Cannon-gate),\r\non which Mahmoud planted his standard, and first saw the city. Still\r\nthe same lofty domes and minarets towered above the verdurous walls,\r\nwhere Constantine had died, and the Turk had entered the city. The\r\nplain around was interspersed with cemeteries, Turk, Greek, and\r\nArmenian, with their growth of cypress trees; and other woods of more\r\ncheerful aspect, diversified the scene. Among them the Greek army was\r\nencamped, and their squadrons moved to and fro\xe2\x80\x94now in regular march,\r\nnow in swift career.\r\n\r\nRaymond\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed on the city. \xe2\x80\x9cI have counted the hours of her\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cone month, and she falls. Remain with me till then;\r\nwait till you see the cross on St. Sophia; and then return to your\r\npeaceful glades.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou then,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cstill remain in Greece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Raymond. \xe2\x80\x9cYet Lionel, when I say this, believe me\r\nI look back with regret to our tranquil life at Windsor. I am but half\r\na soldier; I love the renown, but not the trade of war. Before the\r\nbattle of Rodosto I was full of hope and spirit; to conquer there, and\r\nafterwards to take Constantinople, was the hope, the bourne, the\r\nfulfilment of my ambition. This enthusiasm is now spent, I know not\r\nwhy; I seem to myself to be entering a darksome gulph; the ardent\r\nspirit of the army is irksome to me, the rapture of triumph null.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and was lost in thought. His serious mien recalled, by some\r\nassociation, the half-forgotten Evadne to my mind, and I seized this\r\nopportunity to make enquiries from him concerning her strange lot. I\r\nasked him, if he had ever seen among the troops any one resembling her;\r\nif since he had returned to Greece he had heard of her?\r\n\r\nHe started at her name,\xe2\x80\x94he looked uneasily on me. \xe2\x80\x9cEven so,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would speak of her. Long, long I had forgotten her. Since\r\nour encampment here, she daily, hourly visits my thoughts. When I am\r\naddressed, her name is the sound I expect: in every communication, I\r\nimagine that she will form a part. At length you have broken the spell;\r\ntell me what you know of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI related my meeting with her; the story of her death was told and\r\nre-told. With painful earnestness he questioned me concerning her\r\nprophecies with regard to him. I treated them as the ravings of a\r\nmaniac. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not deceive yourself,\xe2\x80\x94me you cannot. She\r\nhas said nothing but what I knew before\xe2\x80\x94though this is confirmation.\r\nFire, the sword, and plague! They may all be found in yonder city; on\r\nmy head alone may they fall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this day Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy increased. He secluded himself as\r\nmuch as the duties of his station permitted. When in company, sadness\r\nwould in spite of every effort steal over his features, and he sat\r\nabsent and mute among the busy crowd that thronged about him. Perdita\r\nrejoined him, and before her he forced himself to appear cheerful, for\r\nshe, even as a mirror, changed as he changed, and if he were silent and\r\nanxious, she solicitously inquired concerning, and endeavoured to\r\nremove the cause of his seriousness. She resided at the palace of Sweet\r\nWaters, a summer seraglio of the Sultan; the beauty of the surrounding\r\nscenery, undefiled by war, and the freshness of the river, made this\r\nspot doubly delightful. Raymond felt no relief, received no pleasure\r\nfrom any show of heaven or earth. He often left Perdita, to wander in\r\nthe grounds alone; or in a light shallop he floated idly on the pure\r\nwaters, musing deeply. Sometimes I joined him; at such times his\r\ncountenance was invariably solemn, his air dejected. He seemed relieved\r\non seeing me, and would talk with some degree of interest on the\r\naffairs of the day. There was evidently something behind all this; yet,\r\nwhen he appeared about to speak of that which was nearest his heart, he\r\nwould abruptly turn away, and with a sigh endeavour to deliver the\r\npainful idea to the winds.\r\n\r\nIt had often occurred, that, when, as I said, Raymond quitted Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawing-room, Clara came up to me, and gently drawing me aside, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa is gone; shall we go to him? I dare say he will be glad to see\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d And, as accident permitted, I complied with or refused her\r\nrequest. One evening a numerous assembly of Greek chieftains were\r\ngathered together in the palace. The intriguing Palli, the accomplished\r\nKarazza, the warlike Ypsilanti, were among the principal. They talked\r\nof the events of the day; the skirmish at noon; the diminished numbers\r\nof the Infidels; their defeat and flight: they contemplated, after a\r\nshort interval of time, the capture of the Golden City. They\r\nendeavoured to picture forth what would then happen, and spoke in lofty\r\nterms of the prosperity of Greece, when Constantinople should become\r\nits capital. The conversation then reverted to Asiatic intelligence,\r\nand the ravages the plague made in its chief cities; conjectures were\r\nhazarded as to the progress that disease might have made in the\r\nbesieged city.\r\n\r\nRaymond had joined in the former part of the discussion. In lively\r\nterms he demonstrated the extremities to which Constantinople was\r\nreduced; the wasted and haggard, though ferocious appearance of the\r\ntroops; famine and pestilence was at work for them, he observed, and\r\nthe infidels would soon be obliged to take refuge in their only\r\nhope\xe2\x80\x94submission. Suddenly in the midst of his harangue he broke off, as\r\nif stung by some painful thought; he rose uneasily, and I perceived him\r\nat length quit the hall, and through the long corridor seek the open\r\nair. He did not return; and soon Clara crept round to me, making the\r\naccustomed invitation. I consented to her request, and taking her\r\nlittle hand, followed Raymond. We found him just about to embark in his\r\nboat, and he readily agreed to receive us as companions. After the\r\nheats of the day, the cooling land-breeze ruffled the river, and filled\r\nour little sail. The city looked dark to the south, while numerous\r\nlights along the near shores, and the beautiful aspect of the banks\r\nreposing in placid night, the waters keenly reflecting the heavenly\r\nlights, gave to this beauteous river a dower of loveliness that might\r\nhave characterized a retreat in Paradise. Our single boatman attended\r\nto the sail; Raymond steered; Clara sat at his feet, clasping his knees\r\nwith her arms, and laying her head on them. Raymond began the\r\nconversation somewhat abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, my friend, is probably the last time we shall have an\r\nopportunity of conversing freely; my plans are now in full operation,\r\nand my time will become more and more occupied. Besides, I wish at once\r\nto tell you my wishes and expectations, and then never again to revert\r\nto so painful a subject. First, I must thank you, Lionel, for having\r\nremained here at my request. Vanity first prompted me to ask you:\r\nvanity, I call it; yet even in this I see the hand of fate\xe2\x80\x94your\r\npresence will soon be necessary; you will become the last resource of\r\nPerdita, her protector and consoler. You will take her back to\r\nWindsor.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot without you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not mean to separate again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not deceive yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cthe separation at hand is\r\none over which I have no control; most near at hand is it; the days are\r\nalready counted. May I trust you? For many days I have longed to\r\ndisclose the mysterious presentiments that weigh on me, although I fear\r\nthat you will ridicule them. Yet do not, my gentle friend; for, all\r\nchildish and unwise as they are, they have become a part of me, and I\r\ndare not expect to shake them off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet how can I expect you to sympathize with me? You are of this world;\r\nI am not. You hold forth your hand; it is even as a part of yourself;\r\nand you do not yet divide the feeling of identity from the mortal form\r\nthat shapes forth Lionel. How then can you understand me? Earth is to\r\nme a tomb, the firmament a vault, shrouding mere corruption. Time is no\r\nmore, for I have stepped within the threshold of eternity; each man I\r\nmeet appears a corse, which will soon be deserted of its animating\r\nspark, on the eve of decay and corruption.\r\n\r\nCada piedra un piramide levanta,\r\ny cada flor costruye un monumento,\r\ncada edificio es un sepulcro altivo,\r\ncada soldado un esqueleto vivo.\xe2\x80\x9d[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis accent was mournful,\xe2\x80\x94he sighed deeply. \xe2\x80\x9cA few months ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cI was thought to be dying; but life was strong within me.\r\nMy affections were human; hope and love were the day-stars of my life.\r\nNow\xe2\x80\x94 they dream that the brows of the conqueror of the infidel faith\r\nare about to be encircled by triumphant laurel; they talk of honourable\r\nreward, of title, power, and wealth\xe2\x80\x94all I ask of Greece is a grave. Let\r\nthem raise a mound above my lifeless body, which may stand even when\r\nthe dome of St. Sophia has fallen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWherefore do I feel thus? At Rodosto I was full of hope; but when\r\nfirst I saw Constantinople, that feeling, with every other joyful one,\r\ndeparted. The last words of Evadne were the seal upon the warrant of my\r\ndeath. Yet I do not pretend to account for my mood by any particular\r\nevent. All I can say is, that it is so. The plague I am told is in\r\nConstantinople, perhaps I have imbibed its effluvia\xe2\x80\x94perhaps disease is\r\nthe real cause of my prognostications. It matters little why or\r\nwherefore I am affected, no power can avert the stroke, and the shadow\r\nof Fate\xe2\x80\x99s uplifted hand already darkens me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, Lionel, I entrust your sister and her child. Never mention to\r\nher the fatal name of Evadne. She would doubly sorrow over the strange\r\nlink that enchains me to her, making my spirit obey her dying voice,\r\nfollowing her, as it is about to do, to the unknown country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI listened to him with wonder; but that his sad demeanour and solemn\r\nutterance assured me of the truth and intensity of his feelings, I\r\nshould with light derision have attempted to dissipate his fears.\r\nWhatever I was about to reply, was interrupted by the powerful emotions\r\nof Clara. Raymond had spoken, thoughtless of her presence, and she,\r\npoor child, heard with terror and faith the prophecy of his death. Her\r\nfather was moved by her violent grief; he took her in his arms and\r\nsoothed her, but his very soothings were solemn and fearful. \xe2\x80\x9cWeep not,\r\nsweet child,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe coming death of one you have hardly known.\r\nI may die, but in death I can never forget or desert my own Clara. In\r\nafter sorrow or joy, believe that you father\xe2\x80\x99s spirit is near, to save\r\nor sympathize with you. Be proud of me, and cherish your infant\r\nremembrance of me. Thus, sweetest, I shall not appear to die. One thing\r\nyou must promise,\xe2\x80\x94not to speak to any one but your uncle, of the\r\nconversation you have just overheard. When I am gone, you will console\r\nyour mother, and tell her that death was only bitter because it divided\r\nme from her; that my last thoughts will be spent on her. But while I\r\nlive, promise not to betray me; promise, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith faltering accents Clara promised, while she still clung to her\r\nfather in a transport of sorrow. Soon we returned to shore, and I\r\nendeavoured to obviate the impression made on the child\xe2\x80\x99s mind, by\r\ntreating Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s fears lightly. We heard no more of them; for, as he\r\nhad said, the siege, now drawing to a conclusion, became paramount in\r\ninterest, engaging all his time and attention.\r\n\r\nThe empire of the Mahometans in Europe was at its close. The Greek\r\nfleet blockading every port of Stamboul, prevented the arrival of\r\nsuccour from Asia; all egress on the side towards land had become\r\nimpracticable, except to such desperate sallies, as reduced the numbers\r\nof the enemy without making any impression on our lines. The garrison\r\nwas now so much diminished, that it was evident that the city could\r\neasily have been carried by storm; but both humanity and policy\r\ndictated a slower mode of proceeding. We could hardly doubt that, if\r\npursued to the utmost, its palaces, its temples and store of wealth\r\nwould be destroyed in the fury of contending triumph and defeat.\r\nAlready the defenceless citizens had suffered through the barbarity of\r\nthe Janisaries; and, in time of storm, tumult and massacre, beauty,\r\ninfancy and decrepitude, would have alike been sacrificed to the brutal\r\nferocity of the soldiers. Famine and blockade were certain means of\r\nconquest; and on these we founded our hopes of victory.\r\n\r\nEach day the soldiers of the garrison assaulted our advanced posts, and\r\nimpeded the accomplishment of our works. Fire-boats were launched from\r\nthe various ports, while our troops sometimes recoiled from the devoted\r\ncourage of men who did not seek to live, but to sell their lives\r\ndearly. These contests were aggravated by the season: they took place\r\nduring summer, when the southern Asiatic wind came laden with\r\nintolerable heat, when the streams were dried up in their shallow beds,\r\nand the vast basin of the sea appeared to glow under the unmitigated\r\nrays of the solsticial sun. Nor did night refresh the earth. Dew was\r\ndenied; herbage and flowers there were none; the very trees drooped;\r\nand summer assumed the blighted appearance of winter, as it went forth\r\nin silence and flame to abridge the means of sustenance to man. In vain\r\ndid the eye strive to find the wreck of some northern cloud in the\r\nstainless empyrean, which might bring hope of change and moisture to\r\nthe oppressive and windless atmosphere. All was serene, burning,\r\nannihilating. We the besiegers were in the comparison little affected\r\nby these evils. The woods around afforded us shade,\xe2\x80\x94the river secured\r\nto us a constant supply of water; nay, detachments were employed in\r\nfurnishing the army with ice, which had been laid up on Haemus, and\r\nAthos, and the mountains of Macedonia, while cooling fruits and\r\nwholesome food renovated the strength of the labourers, and made us\r\nbear with less impatience the weight of the unrefreshing air. But in\r\nthe city things wore a different face. The sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays were refracted\r\nfrom the pavement and buildings\xe2\x80\x94the stoppage of the public\r\nfountains\xe2\x80\x94the bad quality of the food, and scarcity even of that,\r\nproduced a state of suffering, which was aggravated by the scourge of\r\ndisease; while the garrison arrogated every superfluity to themselves,\r\nadding by waste and riot to the necessary evils of the time. Still they\r\nwould not capitulate.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the system of warfare was changed. We experienced no more\r\nassaults; and by night and day we continued our labours unimpeded.\r\nStranger still, when the troops advanced near the city, the walls were\r\nvacant, and no cannon was pointed against the intruders. When these\r\ncircumstances were reported to Raymond, he caused minute observations\r\nto be made as to what was doing within the walls, and when his scouts\r\nreturned, reporting only the continued silence and desolation of the\r\ncity, he commanded the army to be drawn out before the gates. No one\r\nappeared on the walls; the very portals, though locked and barred,\r\nseemed unguarded; above, the many domes and glittering crescents\r\npierced heaven; while the old walls, survivors of ages, with\r\nivy-crowned tower and weed-tangled buttress, stood as rocks in an\r\nuninhabited waste. From within the city neither shout nor cry, nor\r\naught except the casual howling of a dog, broke the noon-day stillness.\r\nEven our soldiers were awed to silence; the music paused; the clang of\r\narms was hushed. Each man asked his fellow in whispers, the meaning of\r\nthis sudden peace; while Raymond from an height endeavoured, by means\r\nof glasses, to discover and observe the stratagem of the enemy. No form\r\ncould be discerned on the terraces of the houses; in the higher parts\r\nof the town no moving shadow bespoke the presence of any living being:\r\nthe very trees waved not, and mocked the stability of architecture with\r\nlike immovability.\r\n\r\nThe tramp of horses, distinctly heard in the silence, was at length\r\ndiscerned. It was a troop sent by Karazza, the Admiral; they bore\r\ndispatches to the Lord General. The contents of these papers were\r\nimportant. The night before, the watch, on board one of the smaller\r\nvessels anchored near the seraglio wall, was roused by a slight\r\nsplashing as of muffled oars; the alarm was given: twelve small boats,\r\neach containing three Janizaries, were descried endeavouring to make\r\ntheir way through the fleet to the opposite shore of Scutari. When they\r\nfound themselves discovered they discharged their muskets, and some\r\ncame to the front to cover the others, whose crews, exerting all their\r\nstrength, endeavoured to escape with their light barks from among the\r\ndark hulls that environed them. They were in the end all sunk, and,\r\nwith the exception of two or three prisoners, the crews drowned. Little\r\ncould be got from the survivors; but their cautious answers caused it\r\nto be surmised that several expeditions had preceded this last, and\r\nthat several Turks of rank and importance had been conveyed to Asia.\r\nThe men disdainfully repelled the idea of having deserted the defence\r\nof their city; and one, the youngest among them, in answer to the taunt\r\nof a sailor, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cTake it, Christian dogs! take the palaces, the\r\ngardens, the mosques, the abode of our fathers\xe2\x80\x94take plague with them;\r\npestilence is the enemy we fly; if she be your friend, hug her to your\r\nbosoms. The curse of Allah is on Stamboul, share ye her fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the account sent by Karazza to Raymond: but a tale full of\r\nmonstrous exaggerations, though founded on this, was spread by the\r\naccompanying troop among our soldiers. A murmur arose, the city was the\r\nprey of pestilence; already had a mighty power subjugated the\r\ninhabitants; Death had become lord of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nI have heard a picture described, wherein all the inhabitants of earth\r\nwere drawn out in fear to stand the encounter of Death. The feeble and\r\ndecrepid fled; the warriors retreated, though they threatened even in\r\nflight. Wolves and lions, and various monsters of the desert roared\r\nagainst him; while the grim Unreality hovered shaking his spectral\r\ndart, a solitary but invincible assailant. Even so was it with the army\r\nof Greece. I am convinced, that had the myriad troops of Asia come from\r\nover the Propontis, and stood defenders of the Golden City, each and\r\nevery Greek would have marched against the overwhelming numbers, and\r\nhave devoted himself with patriotic fury for his country. But here no\r\nhedge of bayonets opposed itself, no death-dealing artillery, no\r\nformidable array of brave soldiers\xe2\x80\x94the unguarded walls afforded easy\r\nentrance\xe2\x80\x94the vacant palaces luxurious dwellings; but above the dome of\r\nSt. Sophia the superstitious Greek saw Pestilence, and shrunk in\r\ntrepidation from her influence.\r\n\r\nRaymond was actuated by far other feelings. He descended the hill with\r\na face beaming with triumph, and pointing with his sword to the gates,\r\ncommanded his troops to\xe2\x80\x94down with those barricades\xe2\x80\x94the only obstacles\r\nnow to completest victory. The soldiers answered his cheerful words\r\nwith aghast and awe-struck looks; instinctively they drew back, and\r\nRaymond rode in the front of the lines:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBy my sword I swear,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat no ambush or stratagem endangers you. The enemy is already\r\nvanquished; the pleasant places, the noble dwellings and spoil of the\r\ncity are already yours; force the gate; enter and possess the seats of\r\nyour ancestors, your own inheritance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn universal shudder and fearful whispering passed through the lines;\r\nnot a soldier moved. \xe2\x80\x9cCowards!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed their general, exasperated,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgive me an hatchet! I alone will enter! I will plant your standard;\r\nand when you see it wave from yon highest minaret, you may gain\r\ncourage, and rally round it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the officers now came forward: \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe neither\r\nfear the courage, nor arms, the open attack, nor secret ambush of the\r\nMoslems. We are ready to expose our breasts, exposed ten thousand times\r\nbefore, to the balls and scymetars of the infidels, and to fall\r\ngloriously for Greece. But we will not die in heaps, like dogs poisoned\r\nin summer-time, by the pestilential air of that city\xe2\x80\x94we dare not go\r\nagainst the plague!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA multitude of men are feeble and inert, without a voice, a leader;\r\ngive them that, and they regain the strength belonging to their\r\nnumbers. Shouts from a thousand voices now rent the air\xe2\x80\x94the cry of\r\napplause became universal. Raymond saw the danger; he was willing to\r\nsave his troops from the crime of disobedience; for he knew, that\r\ncontention once begun between the commander and his army, each act and\r\nword added to the weakness of the former, and bestowed power on the\r\nlatter. He gave orders for the retreat to be sounded, and the regiments\r\nrepaired in good order to the camp.\r\n\r\nI hastened to carry the intelligence of these strange proceedings to\r\nPerdita; and we were soon joined by Raymond. He looked gloomy and\r\nperturbed. My sister was struck by my narrative: \xe2\x80\x9cHow beyond the\r\nimagination of man,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9care the decrees of heaven,\r\nwondrous and inexplicable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish girl,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Raymond angrily, \xe2\x80\x9care you like my valiant\r\nsoldiers, panic-struck? What is there inexplicable, pray, tell me, in\r\nso very natural an occurrence? Does not the plague rage each year in\r\nStamboul? What wonder, that this year, when as we are told, its\r\nvirulence is unexampled in Asia, that it should have occasioned double\r\nhavoc in that city? What wonder then, in time of siege, want, extreme\r\nheat, and drought, that it should make unaccustomed ravages? Less\r\nwonder far is it, that the garrison, despairing of being able to hold\r\nout longer, should take advantage of the negligence of our fleet to\r\nescape at once from siege and capture. It is not pestilence \xe2\x80\x94by the God\r\nthat lives! it is not either plague or impending danger that makes us,\r\nlike birds in harvest-time, terrified by a scarecrow, abstain from the\r\nready prey\xe2\x80\x94it is base superstition\xe2\x80\x94And thus the aim of the valiant is\r\nmade the shuttlecock of fools; the worthy ambition of the high-souled,\r\nthe plaything of these tamed hares! But yet Stamboul shall be ours! By\r\nmy past labours, by torture and imprisonment suffered for them, by my\r\nvictories, by my sword, I swear\xe2\x80\x94by my hopes of fame, by my former\r\ndeserts now awaiting their reward, I deeply vow, with these hands to\r\nplant the cross on yonder mosque!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Raymond!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Perdita, in a supplicating accent.\r\n\r\nHe had been walking to and fro in the marble hall of the seraglio; his\r\nvery lips were pale with rage, while, quivering, they shaped his angry\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94 his eyes shot fire\xe2\x80\x94his gestures seemed restrained by their very\r\nvehemence. \xe2\x80\x9cPerdita,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cI know what you would\r\nsay; I know that you love me, that you are good and gentle; but this is\r\nno woman\xe2\x80\x99s work\xe2\x80\x94nor can a female heart guess at the hurricane which\r\ntears me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed half afraid of his own violence, and suddenly quitted the\r\nhall: a look from Perdita shewed me her distress, and I followed him.\r\nHe was pacing the garden: his passions were in a state of inconceivable\r\nturbulence. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I for ever,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cto be the sport of fortune!\r\nMust man, the heaven-climber, be for ever the victim of the crawling\r\nreptiles of his species! Were I as you, Lionel, looking forward to many\r\nyears of life, to a succession of love-enlightened days, to refined\r\nenjoyments and fresh-springing hopes, I might yield, and breaking my\r\nGeneral\xe2\x80\x99s staff, seek repose in the glades of Windsor. But I am about\r\nto die!\xe2\x80\x94nay, interrupt me not\xe2\x80\x94soon I shall die. From the many-peopled\r\nearth, from the sympathies of man, from the loved resorts of my youth,\r\nfrom the kindness of my friends, from the affection of my only beloved\r\nPerdita, I am about to be removed. Such is the will of fate! Such the\r\ndecree of the High Ruler from whom there is no appeal: to whom I\r\nsubmit. But to lose all\xe2\x80\x94to lose with life and love, glory also! It\r\nshall not be!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, and in a few brief years, all you,\xe2\x80\x94this panic-struck army, and all\r\nthe population of fair Greece, will no longer be. But other generations\r\nwill arise, and ever and for ever will continue, to be made happier by\r\nour present acts, to be glorified by our valour. The prayer of my youth\r\nwas to be one among those who render the pages of earth\xe2\x80\x99s history\r\nsplendid; who exalt the race of man, and make this little globe a\r\ndwelling of the mighty. Alas, for Raymond! the prayer of his youth is\r\nwasted\xe2\x80\x94the hopes of his manhood are null!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my dungeon in yonder city I cried, soon I will be thy lord! When\r\nEvadne pronounced my death, I thought that the title of Victor of\r\nConstantinople would be written on my tomb, and I subdued all mortal\r\nfear. I stand before its vanquished walls, and dare not call myself a\r\nconqueror. So shall it not be! Did not Alexander leap from the walls of\r\nthe city of the Oxydracae, to shew his coward troops the way to\r\nvictory, encountering alone the swords of its defenders? Even so will I\r\nbrave the plague\xe2\x80\x94and though no man follow, I will plant the Grecian\r\nstandard on the height of St. Sophia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReason came unavailing to such high-wrought feelings. In vain I shewed\r\nhim, that when winter came, the cold would dissipate the pestilential\r\nair, and restore courage to the Greeks. \xe2\x80\x9cTalk not of other season than\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI have lived my last winter, and the date of this\r\nyear, 2092, will be carved upon my tomb. Already do I see,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, looking up mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthe bourne and precipitate edge of\r\nmy existence, over which I plunge into the gloomy mystery of the life\r\nto come. I am prepared, so that I leave behind a trail of light so\r\nradiant, that my worst enemies cannot cloud it. I owe this to Greece,\r\nto you, to my surviving Perdita, and to myself, the victim of\r\nambition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were interrupted by an attendant, who announced, that the staff of\r\nRaymond was assembled in the council-chamber. He requested me in the\r\nmeantime to ride through the camp, and to observe and report to him the\r\ndispositions of the soldiers; he then left me. I had been excited to\r\nthe utmost by the proceedings of the day, and now more than ever by the\r\npassionate language of Raymond. Alas! for human reason! He accused the\r\nGreeks of superstition: what name did he give to the faith he lent to\r\nthe predictions of Evadne? I passed from the palace of Sweet Waters to\r\nthe plain on which the encampment lay, and found its inhabitants in\r\ncommotion. The arrival of several with fresh stories of marvels, from\r\nthe fleet; the exaggerations bestowed on what was already known; tales\r\nof old prophecies, of fearful histories of whole regions which had been\r\nlaid waste during the present year by pestilence, alarmed and occupied\r\nthe troops. Discipline was lost; the army disbanded itself. Each\r\nindividual, before a part of a great whole moving only in unison with\r\nothers, now became resolved into the unit nature had made him, and\r\nthought of himself only. They stole off at first by ones and twos, then\r\nin larger companies, until, unimpeded by the officers, whole battalions\r\nsought the road that led to Macedonia.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight I returned to the palace and sought Raymond; he was\r\nalone, and apparently composed; such composure, at least, was his as is\r\ninspired by a resolve to adhere to a certain line of conduct. He heard\r\nmy account of the self-dissolution of the army with calmness, and then\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Verney, my fixed determination not to quit this place,\r\nuntil in the light of day Stamboul is confessedly ours. If the men I\r\nhave about me shrink from following me, others, more courageous, are to\r\nbe found. Go you before break of day, bear these dispatches to Karazza,\r\nadd to them your own entreaties that he send me his marines and naval\r\nforce; if I can get but one regiment to second me, the rest would\r\nfollow of course. Let him send me this regiment. I shall expect your\r\nreturn by to-morrow noon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMethought this was but a poor expedient; but I assured him of my\r\nobedience and zeal. I quitted him to take a few hours rest. With the\r\nbreaking of morning I was accoutred for my ride. I lingered awhile,\r\ndesirous of taking leave of Perdita, and from my window observed the\r\napproach of the sun. The golden splendour arose, and weary nature awoke\r\nto suffer yet another day of heat and thirsty decay. No flowers lifted\r\nup their dew-laden cups to meet the dawn; the dry grass had withered on\r\nthe plains; the burning fields of air were vacant of birds; the cicale\r\nalone, children of the sun, began their shrill and deafening song among\r\nthe cypresses and olives. I saw Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s coal-black charger brought to\r\nthe palace gate; a small company of officers arrived soon after; care\r\nand fear was painted on each cheek, and in each eye, unrefreshed by\r\nsleep. I found Raymond and Perdita together. He was watching the rising\r\nsun, while with one arm he encircled his beloved\xe2\x80\x99s waist; she looked on\r\nhim, the sun of her life, with earnest gaze of mingled anxiety and\r\ntenderness. Raymond started angrily when he saw me. \xe2\x80\x9cHere still?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this your promised zeal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut even as you speak, I am gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, pardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no right to command or reproach;\r\nbut my life hangs on your departure and speedy return. Farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice had recovered its bland tone, but a dark cloud still hung on\r\nhis features. I would have delayed; I wished to recommend watchfulness\r\nto Perdita, but his presence restrained me. I had no pretence for my\r\nhesitation; and on his repeating his farewell, I clasped his\r\noutstretched hand; it was cold and clammy. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care of yourself, my\r\ndear Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perdita, \xe2\x80\x9cthat task shall be mine. Return speedily,\r\nLionel.\xe2\x80\x9d With an air of absence he was playing with her auburn locks,\r\nwhile she leaned on him; twice I turned back, only to look again on\r\nthis matchless pair. At last, with slow and heavy steps, I had paced\r\nout of the hall, and sprung upon my horse. At that moment Clara flew\r\ntowards me; clasping my knee she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cMake haste back, uncle! Dear\r\nuncle, I have such fearful dreams; I dare not tell my mother. Do not be\r\nlong away!\xe2\x80\x9d I assured her of my impatience to return, and then, with a\r\nsmall escort rode along the plain towards the tower of Marmora.\r\n\r\nI fulfilled my commission; I saw Karazza. He was somewhat surprised; he\r\nwould see, he said, what could be done; but it required time; and\r\nRaymond had ordered me to return by noon. It was impossible to effect\r\nany thing in so short a time. I must stay till the next day; or come\r\nback, after having reported the present state of things to the general.\r\nMy choice was easily made. A restlessness, a fear of what was about to\r\nbetide, a doubt as to Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, urged me to return without\r\ndelay to his quarters. Quitting the Seven Towers, I rode eastward\r\ntowards the Sweet Waters. I took a circuitous path, principally for the\r\nsake of going to the top of the mount before mentioned, which commanded\r\na view of the city. I had my glass with me. The city basked under the\r\nnoon-day sun, and the venerable walls formed its picturesque boundary.\r\nImmediately before me was the Top Kapou, the gate near which Mahomet\r\nhad made the breach by which he entered the city. Trees gigantic and\r\naged grew near; before the gate I discerned a crowd of moving human\r\nfigures\xe2\x80\x94with intense curiosity I lifted my glass to my eye. I saw Lord\r\nRaymond on his charger; a small company of officers had gathered about\r\nhim; and behind was a promiscuous concourse of soldiers and subalterns,\r\ntheir discipline lost, their arms thrown aside; no music sounded, no\r\nbanners streamed. The only flag among them was one which Raymond\r\ncarried; he pointed with it to the gate of the city. The circle round\r\nhim fell back. With angry gestures he leapt from his horse, and seizing\r\na hatchet that hung from his saddle-bow, went with the apparent\r\nintention of battering down the opposing gate. A few men came to aid\r\nhim; their numbers increased; under their united blows the obstacle was\r\nvanquished, gate, portcullis, and fence were demolished; and the wide\r\nsun-lit way, leading to the heart of the city, now lay open before\r\nthem. The men shrank back; they seemed afraid of what they had already\r\ndone, and stood as if they expected some Mighty Phantom to stalk in\r\noffended majesty from the opening. Raymond sprung lightly on his horse,\r\ngrasped the standard, and with words which I could not hear (but his\r\ngestures, being their fit accompaniment, were marked by passionate\r\nenergy,) he seemed to adjure their assistance and companionship; even\r\nas he spoke, the crowd receded from him. Indignation now transported\r\nhim; his words I guessed were fraught with disdain\xe2\x80\x94then turning from\r\nhis coward followers, he addressed himself to enter the city alone. His\r\nvery horse seemed to back from the fatal entrance; his dog, his\r\nfaithful dog, lay moaning and supplicating in his path\xe2\x80\x94in a moment\r\nmore, he had plunged the rowels into the sides of the stung animal, who\r\nbounded forward, and he, the gateway passed, was galloping up the broad\r\nand desart street.\r\n\r\nUntil this moment my soul had been in my eyes only. I had gazed with\r\nwonder, mixed with fear and enthusiasm. The latter feeling now\r\npredominated. I forgot the distance between us: \xe2\x80\x9cI will go with thee,\r\nRaymond!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried; but, my eye removed from the glass, I could scarce\r\ndiscern the pigmy forms of the crowd, which about a mile from me\r\nsurrounded the gate; the form of Raymond was lost. Stung with\r\nimpatience, I urged my horse with force of spur and loosened reins down\r\nthe acclivity, that, before danger could arrive, I might be at the side\r\nof my noble, godlike friend. A number of buildings and trees\r\nintervened, when I had reached the plain, hiding the city from my view.\r\nBut at that moment a crash was heard. Thunderlike it reverberated\r\nthrough the sky, while the air was darkened. A moment more and the old\r\nwalls again met my sight, while over them hovered a murky cloud;\r\nfragments of buildings whirled above, half seen in smoke, while flames\r\nburst out beneath, and continued explosions filled the air with\r\nterrific thunders. Flying from the mass of falling ruin which leapt\r\nover the high walls, and shook the ivy towers, a crowd of soldiers made\r\nfor the road by which I came; I was surrounded, hemmed in by them,\r\nunable to get forward. My impatience rose to its utmost; I stretched\r\nout my hands to the men; I conjured them to turn back and save their\r\nGeneral, the conqueror of Stamboul, the liberator of Greece; tears, aye\r\ntears, in warm flow gushed from my eyes\xe2\x80\x94I would not believe in his\r\ndestruction; yet every mass that darkened the air seemed to bear with\r\nit a portion of the martyred Raymond. Horrible sights were shaped to me\r\nin the turbid cloud that hovered over the city; and my only relief was\r\nderived from the struggles I made to approach the gate. Yet when I\r\neffected my purpose, all I could discern within the precincts of the\r\nmassive walls was a city of fire: the open way through which Raymond\r\nhad ridden was enveloped in smoke and flame. After an interval the\r\nexplosions ceased, but the flames still shot up from various quarters;\r\nthe dome of St. Sophia had disappeared. Strange to say (the result\r\nperhaps of the concussion of air occasioned by the blowing up of the\r\ncity) huge, white thunder clouds lifted themselves up from the southern\r\nhorizon, and gathered over-head; they were the first blots on the blue\r\nexpanse that I had seen for months, and amidst this havoc and despair\r\nthey inspired pleasure. The vault above became obscured, lightning\r\nflashed from the heavy masses, followed instantaneously by crashing\r\nthunder; then the big rain fell. The flames of the city bent beneath\r\nit; and the smoke and dust arising from the ruins was dissipated.\r\n\r\nI no sooner perceived an abatement of the flames than, hurried on by an\r\nirresistible impulse, I endeavoured to penetrate the town. I could only\r\ndo this on foot, as the mass of ruin was impracticable for a horse. I\r\nhad never entered the city before, and its ways were unknown to me. The\r\nstreets were blocked up, the ruins smoking; I climbed up one heap, only\r\nto view others in succession; and nothing told me where the centre of\r\nthe town might be, or towards what point Raymond might have directed\r\nhis course. The rain ceased; the clouds sunk behind the horizon; it was\r\nnow evening, and the sun descended swiftly the western sky. I scrambled\r\non, until I came to a street, whose wooden houses, half-burnt, had been\r\ncooled by the rain, and were fortunately uninjured by the gunpowder. Up\r\nthis I hurried\xe2\x80\x94until now I had not seen a vestige of man. Yet none of\r\nthe defaced human forms which I distinguished, could be Raymond; so I\r\nturned my eyes away, while my heart sickened within me. I came to an\r\nopen space\xe2\x80\x94a mountain of ruin in the midst, announced that some large\r\nmosque had occupied the space\xe2\x80\x94and here, scattered about, I saw various\r\narticles of luxury and wealth, singed, destroyed\xe2\x80\x94but shewing what they\r\nhad been in their ruin\xe2\x80\x94jewels, strings of pearls, embroidered robes,\r\nrich furs, glittering tapestries, and oriental ornaments, seemed to\r\nhave been collected here in a pile destined for destruction; but the\r\nrain had stopped the havoc midway.\r\n\r\nHours passed, while in this scene of ruin I sought for Raymond.\r\nInsurmountable heaps sometimes opposed themselves; the still burning\r\nfires scorched me. The sun set; the atmosphere grew dim\xe2\x80\x94and the evening\r\nstar no longer shone companionless. The glare of flames attested the\r\nprogress of destruction, while, during mingled light and obscurity, the\r\npiles around me took gigantic proportions and weird shapes. For a\r\nmoment I could yield to the creative power of the imagination, and for\r\na moment was soothed by the sublime fictions it presented to me. The\r\nbeatings of my human heart drew me back to blank reality. Where, in\r\nthis wilderness of death, art thou, O Raymond\xe2\x80\x94ornament of England,\r\ndeliverer of Greece, \xe2\x80\x9chero of unwritten story,\xe2\x80\x9d where in this burning\r\nchaos are thy dear relics strewed? I called aloud for him\xe2\x80\x94through the\r\ndarkness of night, over the scorching ruins of fallen Constantinople,\r\nhis name was heard; no voice replied\xe2\x80\x94echo even was mute.\r\n\r\nI was overcome by weariness; the solitude depressed my spirits. The\r\nsultry air impregnated with dust, the heat and smoke of burning\r\npalaces, palsied my limbs. Hunger suddenly came acutely upon me. The\r\nexcitement which had hitherto sustained me was lost; as a building,\r\nwhose props are loosened, and whose foundations rock, totters and\r\nfalls, so when enthusiasm and hope deserted me, did my strength fail. I\r\nsat on the sole remaining step of an edifice, which even in its\r\ndownfall, was huge and magnificent; a few broken walls, not dislodged\r\nby gunpowder, stood in fantastic groupes, and a flame glimmered at\r\nintervals on the summit of the pile. For a time hunger and sleep\r\ncontended, till the constellations reeled before my eyes and then were\r\nlost. I strove to rise, but my heavy lids closed, my limbs\r\nover-wearied, claimed repose\xe2\x80\x94I rested my head on the stone, I yielded\r\nto the grateful sensation of utter forgetfulness; and in that scene of\r\ndesolation, on that night of despair\xe2\x80\x94I slept.\r\n\r\n [3] Calderon de la Barca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars still shone brightly when I awoke, and Taurus high in the\r\nsouthern heaven shewed that it was midnight. I awoke from disturbed\r\ndreams. Methought I had been invited to Timon\xe2\x80\x99s last feast; I came with\r\nkeen appetite, the covers were removed, the hot water sent up its\r\nunsatisfying steams, while I fled before the anger of the host, who\r\nassumed the form of Raymond; while to my diseased fancy, the vessels\r\nhurled by him after me, were surcharged with fetid vapour, and my\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s shape, altered by a thousand distortions, expanded into a\r\ngigantic phantom, bearing on its brow the sign of pestilence. The\r\ngrowing shadow rose and rose, filling, and then seeming to endeavour to\r\nburst beyond, the adamantine vault that bent over, sustaining and\r\nenclosing the world. The night-mare became torture; with a strong\r\neffort I threw off sleep, and recalled reason to her wonted functions.\r\nMy first thought was Perdita; to her I must return; her I must support,\r\ndrawing such food from despair as might best sustain her wounded heart;\r\nrecalling her from the wild excesses of grief, by the austere laws of\r\nduty, and the soft tenderness of regret.\r\n\r\nThe position of the stars was my only guide. I turned from the awful\r\nruin of the Golden City, and, after great exertion, succeeded in\r\nextricating myself from its enclosure. I met a company of soldiers\r\noutside the walls; I borrowed a horse from one of them, and hastened to\r\nmy sister. The appearance of the plain was changed during this short\r\ninterval; the encampment was broken up; the relics of the disbanded\r\narmy met in small companies here and there; each face was clouded;\r\nevery gesture spoke astonishment and dismay.\r\n\r\nWith an heavy heart I entered the palace, and stood fearful to advance,\r\nto speak, to look. In the midst of the hall was Perdita; she sat on the\r\nmarble pavement, her head fallen on her bosom, her hair dishevelled,\r\nher fingers twined busily one within the other; she was pale as marble,\r\nand every feature was contracted by agony. She perceived me, and looked\r\nup enquiringly; her half glance of hope was misery; the words died\r\nbefore I could articulate them; I felt a ghastly smile wrinkle my lips.\r\nShe understood my gesture; again her head fell; again her fingers\r\nworked restlessly. At last I recovered speech, but my voice terrified\r\nher; the hapless girl had understood my look, and for worlds she would\r\nnot that the tale of her heavy misery should have been shaped out and\r\nconfirmed by hard, irrevocable words. Nay, she seemed to wish to\r\ndistract my thoughts from the subject: she rose from the floor: \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, whisperingly; \xe2\x80\x9cafter much weeping, Clara sleeps; we must not\r\ndisturb her.\xe2\x80\x9d She seated herself then on the same ottoman where I had\r\nleft her in the morning resting on the beating heart of her Raymond; I\r\ndared not approach her, but sat at a distant corner, watching her\r\nstarting and nervous gestures. At length, in an abrupt manner she\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, fear not,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cfear not that I should entertain hope!\r\nYet tell me, have you found him? To have him once more in my arms, to\r\nsee him, however changed, is all I desire. Though Constantinople be\r\nheaped above him as a tomb, yet I must find him\xe2\x80\x94then cover us with the\r\ncity\xe2\x80\x99s weight, with a mountain piled above\xe2\x80\x94I care not, so that one\r\ngrave hold Raymond and his Perdita.\xe2\x80\x9d Then weeping, she clung to me:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me to him,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cunkind Lionel, why do you keep me here?\r\nOf myself I cannot find him \xe2\x80\x94but you know where he lies\xe2\x80\x94lead me\r\nthither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first these agonizing plaints filled me with intolerable compassion.\r\nBut soon I endeavoured to extract patience for her from the ideas she\r\nsuggested. I related my adventures of the night, my endeavours to find\r\nour lost one, and my disappointment. Turning her thoughts this way, I\r\ngave them an object which rescued them from insanity. With apparent\r\ncalmness she discussed with me the probable spot where he might be\r\nfound, and planned the means we should use for that purpose. Then\r\nhearing of my fatigue and abstinence, she herself brought me food. I\r\nseized the favourable moment, and endeavoured to awaken in her\r\nsomething beyond the killing torpor of grief. As I spoke, my subject\r\ncarried me away; deep admiration; grief, the offspring of truest\r\naffection, the overflowing of a heart bursting with sympathy for all\r\nthat had been great and sublime in the career of my friend, inspired me\r\nas I poured forth the praises of Raymond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, for us,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwho have lost this latest honour of the\r\nworld! Beloved Raymond! He is gone to the nations of the dead; he has\r\nbecome one of those, who render the dark abode of the obscure grave\r\nillustrious by dwelling there. He has journied on the road that leads\r\nto it, and joined the mighty of soul who went before him. When the\r\nworld was in its infancy death must have been terrible, and man left\r\nhis friends and kindred to dwell, a solitary stranger, in an unknown\r\ncountry. But now, he who dies finds many companions gone before to\r\nprepare for his reception. The great of past ages people it, the\r\nexalted hero of our own days is counted among its inhabitants, while\r\nlife becomes doubly \xe2\x80\x98the desart and the solitude.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a noble creature was Raymond, the first among the men of our\r\ntime. By the grandeur of his conceptions, the graceful daring of his\r\nactions, by his wit and beauty, he won and ruled the minds of all. Of\r\none only fault he might have been accused; but his death has cancelled\r\nthat. I have heard him called inconstant of purpose\xe2\x80\x94when he deserted,\r\nfor the sake of love, the hope of sovereignty, and when he abdicated\r\nthe protectorship of England, men blamed his infirmity of purpose. Now\r\nhis death has crowned his life, and to the end of time it will be\r\nremembered, that he devoted himself, a willing victim, to the glory of\r\nGreece. Such was his choice: he expected to die. He foresaw that he\r\nshould leave this cheerful earth, the lightsome sky, and thy love,\r\nPerdita; yet he neither hesitated or turned back, going right onward to\r\nhis mark of fame. While the earth lasts, his actions will be recorded\r\nwith praise. Grecian maidens will in devotion strew flowers on his\r\ntomb, and make the air around it resonant with patriotic hymns, in\r\nwhich his name will find high record.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw the features of Perdita soften; the sternness of grief yielded to\r\ntenderness\xe2\x80\x94I continued:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThus to honour him, is the sacred duty of his\r\nsurvivors. To make his name even as an holy spot of ground, enclosing\r\nit from all hostile attacks by our praise, shedding on it the blossoms\r\nof love and regret, guarding it from decay, and bequeathing it\r\nuntainted to posterity. Such is the duty of his friends. A dearer one\r\nbelongs to you, Perdita, mother of his child. Do you remember in her\r\ninfancy, with what transport you beheld Clara, recognizing in her the\r\nunited being of yourself and Raymond; joying to view in this living\r\ntemple a manifestation of your eternal loves. Even such is she still.\r\nYou say that you have lost Raymond. O, no!\xe2\x80\x94yet he lives with you and in\r\nyou there. From him she sprung, flesh of his flesh, bone of his\r\nbone\xe2\x80\x94and not, as heretofore, are you content to trace in her downy\r\ncheek and delicate limbs, an affinity to Raymond, but in her\r\nenthusiastic affections, in the sweet qualities of her mind, you may\r\nstill find him living, the good, the great, the beloved. Be it your\r\ncare to foster this similarity\xe2\x80\x94be it your care to render her worthy of\r\nhim, so that, when she glory in her origin, she take not shame for what\r\nshe is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could perceive that, when I recalled my sister\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts to her\r\nduties in life, she did not listen with the same patience as before.\r\nShe appeared to suspect a plan of consolation on my part, from which\r\nshe, cherishing her new-born grief, revolted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk of the future,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile the present is all to me. Let me find the earthly\r\ndwelling of my beloved; let us rescue that from common dust, so that in\r\ntimes to come men may point to the sacred tomb, and name it his\xe2\x80\x94then to\r\nother thoughts, and a new course of life, or what else fate, in her\r\ncruel tyranny, may have marked out for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a short repose I prepared to leave her, that I might endeavour to\r\naccomplish her wish. In the mean time we were joined by Clara, whose\r\npallid cheek and scared look shewed the deep impression grief had made\r\non her young mind. She seemed to be full of something to which she\r\ncould not give words; but, seizing an opportunity afforded by Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence, she preferred to me an earnest prayer, that I would take her\r\nwithin view of the gate at which her father had entered Constantinople.\r\nShe promised to commit no extravagance, to be docile, and immediately\r\nto return. I could not refuse; for Clara was not an ordinary child; her\r\nsensibility and intelligence seemed already to have endowed her with\r\nthe rights of womanhood. With her therefore, before me on my horse,\r\nattended only by the servant who was to re-conduct her, we rode to the\r\nTop Kapou. We found a party of soldiers gathered round it. They were\r\nlistening. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are human cries,\xe2\x80\x9d said one: \xe2\x80\x9cMore like the howling of\r\na dog,\xe2\x80\x9d replied another; and again they bent to catch the sound of\r\nregular distant moans, which issued from the precincts of the ruined\r\ncity. \xe2\x80\x9cThat, Clara,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the gate, that the street which\r\nyestermorn your father rode up.\xe2\x80\x9d Whatever Clara\xe2\x80\x99s intention had been in\r\nasking to be brought hither, it was balked by the presence of the\r\nsoldiers. With earnest gaze she looked on the labyrinth of smoking\r\npiles which had been a city, and then expressed her readiness to return\r\nhome. At this moment a melancholy howl struck on our ears; it was\r\nrepeated; \xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clara, \xe2\x80\x9che is there; that is Florio, my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s dog.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed to me impossible that she could recognise the\r\nsound, but she persisted in her assertion till she gained credit with\r\nthe crowd about. At least it would be a benevolent action to rescue the\r\nsufferer, whether human or brute, from the desolation of the town; so,\r\nsending Clara back to her home, I again entered Constantinople.\r\nEncouraged by the impunity attendant on my former visit, several\r\nsoldiers who had made a part of Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s body guard, who had loved\r\nhim, and sincerely mourned his loss, accompanied me.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conjecture the strange enchainment of events which\r\nrestored the lifeless form of my friend to our hands. In that part of\r\nthe town where the fire had most raged the night before, and which now\r\nlay quenched, black and cold, the dying dog of Raymond crouched beside\r\nthe mutilated form of its lord. At such a time sorrow has no voice;\r\naffliction, tamed by its very vehemence, is mute. The poor animal\r\nrecognised me, licked my hand, crept close to its lord, and died. He\r\nhad been evidently thrown from his horse by some falling ruin, which\r\nhad crushed his head, and defaced his whole person. I bent over the\r\nbody, and took in my hand the edge of his cloak, less altered in\r\nappearance than the human frame it clothed. I pressed it to my lips,\r\nwhile the rough soldiers gathered around, mourning over this worthiest\r\nprey of death, as if regret and endless lamentation could re-illumine\r\nthe extinguished spark, or call to its shattered prison-house of flesh\r\nthe liberated spirit. Yesterday those limbs were worth an universe;\r\nthey then enshrined a transcendant power, whose intents, words, and\r\nactions were worthy to be recorded in letters of gold; now the\r\nsuperstition of affection alone could give value to the shattered\r\nmechanism, which, incapable and clod-like, no more resembled Raymond,\r\nthan the fallen rain is like the former mansion of cloud in which it\r\nclimbed the highest skies, and gilded by the sun, attracted all eyes,\r\nand satiated the sense by its excess of beauty.\r\n\r\nSuch as he had now become, such as was his terrene vesture, defaced and\r\nspoiled, we wrapt it in our cloaks, and lifting the burthen in our\r\narms, bore it from this city of the dead. The question arose as to\r\nwhere we should deposit him. In our road to the palace, we passed\r\nthrough the Greek cemetery; here on a tablet of black marble I caused\r\nhim to be laid; the cypresses waved high above, their death-like gloom\r\naccorded with his state of nothingness. We cut branches of the funereal\r\ntrees and placed them over him, and on these again his sword. I left a\r\nguard to protect this treasure of dust; and ordered perpetual torches\r\nto be burned around.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Perdita, I found that she had already been informed\r\nof the success of my undertaking. He, her beloved, the sole and eternal\r\nobject of her passionate tenderness, was restored her. Such was the\r\nmaniac language of her enthusiasm. What though those limbs moved not,\r\nand those lips could no more frame modulated accents of wisdom and\r\nlove! What though like a weed flung from the fruitless sea, he lay the\r\nprey of corruption\xe2\x80\x94 still that was the form she had caressed, those the\r\nlips that meeting hers, had drank the spirit of love from the\r\ncommingling breath; that was the earthly mechanism of dissoluble clay\r\nshe had called her own. True, she looked forward to another life; true,\r\nthe burning spirit of love seemed to her unextinguishable throughout\r\neternity. Yet at this time, with human fondness, she clung to all that\r\nher human senses permitted her to see and feel to be a part of Raymond.\r\n\r\nPale as marble, clear and beaming as that, she heard my tale, and\r\nenquired concerning the spot where he had been deposited. Her features\r\nhad lost the distortion of grief; her eyes were brightened, her very\r\nperson seemed dilated; while the excessive whiteness and even\r\ntransparency of her skin, and something hollow in her voice, bore\r\nwitness that not tranquillity, but excess of excitement, occasioned the\r\ntreacherous calm that settled on her countenance. I asked her where he\r\nshould be buried. She replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAt Athens; even at the Athens which he\r\nloved. Without the town, on the acclivity of Hymettus, there is a rocky\r\nrecess which he pointed out to me as the spot where he would wish to\r\nrepose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy own desire certainly was that he should not be removed from the spot\r\nwhere he now lay. But her wish was of course to be complied with; and I\r\nentreated her to prepare without delay for our departure.\r\n\r\nBehold now the melancholy train cross the flats of Thrace, and wind\r\nthrough the defiles, and over the mountains of Macedonia, coast the\r\nclear waves of the Peneus, cross the Larissean plain, pass the straits\r\nof Thermopylae, and ascending in succession \xc5\x92rta and Parnassus, descend\r\nto the fertile plain of Athens. Women bear with resignation these long\r\ndrawn ills, but to a man\xe2\x80\x99s impatient spirit, the slow motion of our\r\ncavalcade, the melancholy repose we took at noon, the perpetual\r\npresence of the pall, gorgeous though it was, that wrapt the rifled\r\ncasket which had contained Raymond, the monotonous recurrence of day\r\nand night, unvaried by hope or change, all the circumstances of our\r\nmarch were intolerable. Perdita, shut up in herself, spoke little. Her\r\ncarriage was closed; and, when we rested, she sat leaning her pale\r\ncheek on her white cold hand, with eyes fixed on the ground, indulging\r\nthoughts which refused communication or sympathy.\r\n\r\nWe descended from Parnassus, emerging from its many folds, and passed\r\nthrough Livadia on our road to Attica. Perdita would not enter Athens;\r\nbut reposing at Marathon on the night of our arrival, conducted me on\r\nthe following day, to the spot selected by her as the treasure house of\r\nRaymond\xe2\x80\x99s dear remains. It was in a recess near the head of the ravine\r\nto the south of Hymettus. The chasm, deep, black, and hoary, swept from\r\nthe summit to the base; in the fissures of the rock myrtle underwood\r\ngrew and wild thyme, the food of many nations of bees; enormous crags\r\nprotruded into the cleft, some beetling over, others rising\r\nperpendicularly from it. At the foot of this sublime chasm, a fertile\r\nlaughing valley reached from sea to sea, and beyond was spread the blue\r\nAegean, sprinkled with islands, the light waves glancing beneath the\r\nsun. Close to the spot on which we stood, was a solitary rock, high and\r\nconical, which, divided on every side from the mountain, seemed a\r\nnature-hewn pyramid; with little labour this block was reduced to a\r\nperfect shape; the narrow cell was scooped out beneath in which Raymond\r\nwas placed, and a short inscription, carved in the living stone,\r\nrecorded the name of its tenant, the cause and aera of his death.\r\n\r\nEvery thing was accomplished with speed under my directions. I agreed\r\nto leave the finishing and guardianship of the tomb to the head of the\r\nreligious establishment at Athens, and by the end of October prepared\r\nfor my return to England. I mentioned this to Perdita. It was painful\r\nto appear to drag her from the last scene that spoke of her lost one;\r\nbut to linger here was vain, and my very soul was sick with its\r\nyearning to rejoin my Idris and her babes. In reply, my sister\r\nrequested me to accompany her the following evening to the tomb of\r\nRaymond. Some days had passed since I had visited the spot. The path to\r\nit had been enlarged, and steps hewn in the rock led us less\r\ncircuitously than before, to the spot itself; the platform on which the\r\npyramid stood was enlarged, and looking towards the south, in a recess\r\novershadowed by the straggling branches of a wild fig-tree, I saw\r\nfoundations dug, and props and rafters fixed, evidently the\r\ncommencement of a cottage; standing on its unfinished threshold, the\r\ntomb was at our right-hand, the whole ravine, and plain, and azure sea\r\nimmediately before us; the dark rocks received a glow from the\r\ndescending sun, which glanced along the cultivated valley, and dyed in\r\npurple and orange the placid waves; we sat on a rocky elevation, and I\r\ngazed with rapture on the beauteous panorama of living and changeful\r\ncolours, which varied and enhanced the graces of earth and ocean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I not do right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perdita, \xe2\x80\x9cin having my loved one conveyed\r\nhither? Hereafter this will be the cynosure of Greece. In such a spot\r\ndeath loses half its terrors, and even the inanimate dust appears to\r\npartake of the spirit of beauty which hallows this region. Lionel, he\r\nsleeps there; that is the grave of Raymond, he whom in my youth I first\r\nloved; whom my heart accompanied in days of separation and anger; to\r\nwhom I am now joined for ever. Never\xe2\x80\x94mark me\xe2\x80\x94never will I leave this\r\nspot. Methinks his spirit remains here as well as that dust, which,\r\nuncommunicable though it be, is more precious in its nothingness than\r\naught else widowed earth clasps to her sorrowing bosom. The myrtle\r\nbushes, the thyme, the little cyclamen, which peep from the fissures of\r\nthe rock, all the produce of the place, bear affinity to him; the light\r\nthat invests the hills participates in his essence, and sky and\r\nmountains, sea and valley, are imbued by the presence of his spirit. I\r\nwill live and die here!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo you to England, Lionel; return to sweet Idris and dearest Adrian;\r\nreturn, and let my orphan girl be as a child of your own in your house.\r\nLook on me as dead; and truly if death be a mere change of state, I am\r\ndead. This is another world, from that which late I inhabited, from\r\nthat which is now your home. Here I hold communion only with the has\r\nbeen, and to come. Go you to England, and leave me where alone I can\r\nconsent to drag out the miserable days which I must still live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shower of tears terminated her sad harangue. I had expected some\r\nextravagant proposition, and remained silent awhile, collecting my\r\nthoughts that I might the better combat her fanciful scheme. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncherish dreary thoughts, my dear Perdita,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cnor do I wonder\r\nthat for a time your better reason should be influenced by passionate\r\ngrief and a disturbed imagination. Even I am in love with this last\r\nhome of Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s; nevertheless we must quit it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected this,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Perdita; \xe2\x80\x9cI supposed that you would treat me\r\nas a mad, foolish girl. But do not deceive yourself; this cottage is\r\nbuilt by my order; and here I shall remain, until the hour arrives when\r\nI may share his happier dwelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is there so strange in my design? I might have deceived you;\r\nI might have talked of remaining here only a few months; in your\r\nanxiety to reach Windsor you would have left me, and without reproach\r\nor contention, I might have pursued my plan. But I disdained the\r\nartifice; or rather in my wretchedness it was my only consolation to\r\npour out my heart to you, my brother, my only friend. You will not\r\ndispute with me? You know how wilful your poor, misery-stricken sister\r\nis. Take my girl with you; wean her from sights and thoughts of sorrow;\r\nlet infantine hilarity revisit her heart, and animate her eyes; so\r\ncould it never be, were she near me; it is far better for all of you\r\nthat you should never see me again. For myself, I will not voluntarily\r\nseek death, that is, I will not, while I can command myself; and I can\r\nhere. But drag me from this country; and my power of self control\r\nvanishes, nor can I answer for the violence my agony of grief may lead\r\nme to commit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou clothe your meaning, Perdita,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cin powerful words, yet\r\nthat meaning is selfish and unworthy of you. You have often agreed with\r\nme that there is but one solution to the intricate riddle of life; to\r\nimprove ourselves, and contribute to the happiness of others: and now,\r\nin the very prime of life, you desert your principles, and shut\r\nyourself up in useless solitude. Will you think of Raymond less at\r\nWindsor, the scene of your early happiness? Will you commune less with\r\nhis departed spirit, while you watch over and cultivate the rare\r\nexcellence of his child? You have been sadly visited; nor do I wonder\r\nthat a feeling akin to insanity should drive you to bitter and\r\nunreasonable imaginings. But a home of love awaits you in your native\r\nEngland. My tenderness and affection must soothe you; the society of\r\nRaymond\xe2\x80\x99s friends will be of more solace than these dreary\r\nspeculations. We will all make it our first care, our dearest task, to\r\ncontribute to your happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerdita shook her head; \xe2\x80\x9cIf it could be so,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI were much\r\nin the wrong to disdain your offers. But it is not a matter of choice;\r\nI can live here only. I am a part of this scene; each and all its\r\nproperties are a part of me. This is no sudden fancy; I live by it. The\r\nknowledge that I am here, rises with me in the morning, and enables me\r\nto endure the light; it is mingled with my food, which else were\r\npoison; it walks, it sleeps with me, for ever it accompanies me. Here I\r\nmay even cease to repine, and may add my tardy consent to the decree\r\nwhich has taken him from me. He would rather have died such a death,\r\nwhich will be recorded in history to endless time, than have lived to\r\nold age unknown, unhonoured. Nor can I desire better, than, having been\r\nthe chosen and beloved of his heart, here, in youth\xe2\x80\x99s prime, before\r\nadded years can tarnish the best feelings of my nature, to watch his\r\ntomb, and speedily rejoin him in his blessed repose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much, my dearest Lionel, I have said, wishing to persuade you that\r\nI do right. If you are unconvinced, I can add nothing further by way of\r\nargument, and I can only declare my fixed resolve. I stay here; force\r\nonly can remove me. Be it so; drag me away\xe2\x80\x94I return; confine me,\r\nimprison me, still I escape, and come here. Or would my brother rather\r\ndevote the heart-broken Perdita to the straw and chains of a maniac,\r\nthan suffer her to rest in peace beneath the shadow of His society, in\r\nthis my own selected and beloved recess?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAll this appeared to me, I own, methodized madness. I imagined, that it\r\nwas my imperative duty to take her from scenes that thus forcibly\r\nreminded her of her loss. Nor did I doubt, that in the tranquillity of\r\nour family circle at Windsor, she would recover some degree of\r\ncomposure, and in the end, of happiness. My affection for Clara also\r\nled me to oppose these fond dreams of cherished grief; her sensibility\r\nhad already been too much excited; her infant heedlessness too soon\r\nexchanged for deep and anxious thought. The strange and romantic scheme\r\nof her mother, might confirm and perpetuate the painful view of life,\r\nwhich had intruded itself thus early on her contemplation.\r\n\r\nOn returning home, the captain of the steam packet with whom I had\r\nagreed to sail, came to tell me, that accidental circumstances hastened\r\nhis departure, and that, if I went with him, I must come on board at\r\nfive on the following morning. I hastily gave my consent to this\r\narrangement, and as hastily formed a plan through which Perdita should\r\nbe forced to become my companion. I believe that most people in my\r\nsituation would have acted in the same manner. Yet this consideration\r\ndoes not, or rather did not in after time, diminish the reproaches of\r\nmy conscience. At the moment, I felt convinced that I was acting for\r\nthe best, and that all I did was right and even necessary.\r\n\r\nI sat with Perdita and soothed her, by my seeming assent to her wild\r\nscheme. She received my concurrence with pleasure, and a thousand times\r\nover thanked her deceiving, deceitful brother. As night came on, her\r\nspirits, enlivened by my unexpected concession, regained an almost\r\nforgotten vivacity. I pretended to be alarmed by the feverish glow in\r\nher cheek; I entreated her to take a composing draught; I poured out\r\nthe medicine, which she took docilely from me. I watched her as she\r\ndrank it. Falsehood and artifice are in themselves so hateful, that,\r\nthough I still thought I did right, a feeling of shame and guilt came\r\npainfully upon me. I left her, and soon heard that she slept soundly\r\nunder the influence of the opiate I had administered. She was carried\r\nthus unconscious on board; the anchor weighed, and the wind being\r\nfavourable, we stood far out to sea; with all the canvas spread, and\r\nthe power of the engine to assist, we scudded swiftly and steadily\r\nthrough the chafed element.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the day before Perdita awoke, and a longer time elapsed\r\nbefore recovering from the torpor occasioned by the laudanum, she\r\nperceived her change of situation. She started wildly from her couch,\r\nand flew to the cabin window. The blue and troubled sea sped past the\r\nvessel, and was spread shoreless around: the sky was covered by a rack,\r\nwhich in its swift motion shewed how speedily she was borne away. The\r\ncreaking of the masts, the clang of the wheels, the tramp above, all\r\npersuaded her that she was already far from the shores of\r\nGreece.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are we going?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe attendant whom I had stationed to watch her, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nEngland.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs on deck, Madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnkind! unkind!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the poor victim, as with a deep sigh she\r\nlooked on the waste of waters. Then without further remark, she threw\r\nherself on her couch, and closing her eyes remained motionless; so that\r\nbut for the deep sighs that burst from her, it would have seemed that\r\nshe slept.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I heard that she had spoken, I sent Clara to her, that the\r\nsight of the lovely innocent might inspire gentle and affectionate\r\nthoughts. But neither the presence of her child, nor a subsequent visit\r\nfrom me, could rouse my sister. She looked on Clara with a countenance\r\nof woful meaning, but she did not speak. When I appeared, she turned\r\naway, and in reply to my enquiries, only said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know not what you\r\nhave done!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I trusted that this sullenness betokened merely the\r\nstruggle between disappointment and natural affection, and that in a\r\nfew days she would be reconciled to her fate.\r\n\r\nWhen night came on, she begged that Clara might sleep in a separate\r\ncabin. Her servant, however, remained with her. About midnight she\r\nspoke to the latter, saying that she had had a bad dream, and bade her\r\ngo to her daughter, and bring word whether she rested quietly. The\r\nwoman obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe breeze, that had flagged since sunset, now rose again. I was on\r\ndeck, enjoying our swift progress. The quiet was disturbed only by the\r\nrush of waters as they divided before the steady keel, the murmur of\r\nthe moveless and full sails, the wind whistling in the shrouds, and the\r\nregular motion of the engine. The sea was gently agitated, now shewing\r\na white crest, and now resuming an uniform hue; the clouds had\r\ndisappeared; and dark ether clipt the broad ocean, in which the\r\nconstellations vainly sought their accustomed mirror. Our rate could\r\nnot have been less than eight knots.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard a splash in the sea. The sailors on watch rushed to\r\nthe side of the vessel, with the cry\xe2\x80\x94some one gone overboard. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nnot from deck,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man at the helm, \xe2\x80\x9csomething has been thrown\r\nfrom the aft cabin.\xe2\x80\x9d A call for the boat to be lowered was echoed from\r\nthe deck. I rushed into my sister\xe2\x80\x99s cabin; it was empty.\r\n\r\nWith sails abaft, the engine stopt, the vessel remained unwillingly\r\nstationary, until, after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s search, my poor Perdita was brought\r\non board. But no care could re-animate her, no medicine cause her dear\r\neyes to open, and the blood to flow again from her pulseless heart. One\r\nclenched hand contained a slip of paper, on which was written, \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\nAthens.\xe2\x80\x9d To ensure her removal thither, and prevent the irrecoverable\r\nloss of her body in the wide sea, she had had the precaution to fasten\r\na long shawl round her waist, and again to the staunchions of the cabin\r\nwindow. She had drifted somewhat under the keel of the vessel, and her\r\nbeing out of sight occasioned the delay in finding her. And thus the\r\nill-starred girl died a victim to my senseless rashness. Thus, in early\r\nday, she left us for the company of the dead, and preferred to share\r\nthe rocky grave of Raymond, before the animated scene this cheerful\r\nearth afforded, and the society of loving friends. Thus in her\r\ntwenty-ninth year she died; having enjoyed some few years of the\r\nhappiness of paradise, and sustaining a reverse to which her impatient\r\nspirit and affectionate disposition were unable to submit. As I marked\r\nthe placid expression that had settled on her countenance in death, I\r\nfelt, in spite of the pangs of remorse, in spite of heart-rending\r\nregret, that it was better to die so, than to drag on long, miserable\r\nyears of repining and inconsolable grief. Stress of weather drove us up\r\nthe Adriatic Gulph; and, our vessel being hardly fitted to weather a\r\nstorm, we took refuge in the port of Ancona. Here I met Georgio Palli,\r\nthe vice-admiral of the Greek fleet, a former friend and warm partizan\r\nof Raymond. I committed the remains of my lost Perdita to his care, for\r\nthe purpose of having them transported to Hymettus, and placed in the\r\ncell her Raymond already occupied beneath the pyramid. This was all\r\naccomplished even as I wished. She reposed beside her beloved, and the\r\ntomb above was inscribed with the united names of Raymond and Perdita.\r\n\r\nI then came to a resolution of pursuing our journey to England\r\noverland. My own heart was racked by regrets and remorse. The\r\napprehension, that Raymond had departed for ever, that his name,\r\nblended eternally with the past, must be erased from every anticipation\r\nof the future, had come slowly upon me. I had always admired his\r\ntalents; his noble aspirations; his grand conceptions of the glory and\r\nmajesty of his ambition: his utter want of mean passions; his fortitude\r\nand daring. In Greece I had learnt to love him; his very waywardness,\r\nand self-abandonment to the impulses of superstition, attached me to\r\nhim doubly; it might be weakness, but it was the antipodes of all that\r\nwas grovelling and selfish. To these pangs were added the loss of\r\nPerdita, lost through my own accursed self-will and conceit. This dear\r\none, my sole relation; whose progress I had marked from tender\r\nchildhood through the varied path of life, and seen her throughout\r\nconspicuous for integrity, devotion, and true affection; for all that\r\nconstitutes the peculiar graces of the female character, and beheld her\r\nat last the victim of too much loving, too constant an attachment to\r\nthe perishable and lost, she, in her pride of beauty and life, had\r\nthrown aside the pleasant perception of the apparent world for the\r\nunreality of the grave, and had left poor Clara quite an orphan. I\r\nconcealed from this beloved child that her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death was\r\nvoluntary, and tried every means to awaken cheerfulness in her\r\nsorrow-stricken spirit.\r\n\r\nOne of my first acts for the recovery even of my own composure, was to\r\nbid farewell to the sea. Its hateful splash renewed again and again to\r\nmy sense the death of my sister; its roar was a dirge; in every dark\r\nhull that was tossed on its inconstant bosom, I imaged a bier, that\r\nwould convey to death all who trusted to its treacherous smiles.\r\nFarewell to the sea! Come, my Clara, sit beside me in this aerial bark;\r\nquickly and gently it cleaves the azure serene, and with soft\r\nundulation glides upon the current of the air; or, if storm shake its\r\nfragile mechanism, the green earth is below; we can descend, and take\r\nshelter on the stable continent. Here aloft, the companions of the\r\nswift-winged birds, we skim through the unresisting element, fleetly\r\nand fearlessly. The light boat heaves not, nor is opposed by\r\ndeath-bearing waves; the ether opens before the prow, and the shadow of\r\nthe globe that upholds it, shelters us from the noon-day sun. Beneath\r\nare the plains of Italy, or the vast undulations of the wave-like\r\nApennines: fertility reposes in their many folds, and woods crown the\r\nsummits. The free and happy peasant, unshackled by the Austrian, bears\r\nthe double harvest to the garner; and the refined citizens rear without\r\ndread the long blighted tree of knowledge in this garden of the world.\r\nWe were lifted above the Alpine peaks, and from their deep and brawling\r\nravines entered the plain of fair France, and after an airy journey of\r\nsix days, we landed at Dieppe, furled the feathered wings, and closed\r\nthe silken globe of our little pinnace. A heavy rain made this mode of\r\ntravelling now incommodious; so we embarked in a steam-packet, and\r\nafter a short passage landed at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nA strange story was rife here. A few days before, a tempest-struck\r\nvessel had appeared off the town: the hull was parched-looking and\r\ncracked, the sails rent, and bent in a careless, unseamanlike manner,\r\nthe shrouds tangled and broken. She drifted towards the harbour, and\r\nwas stranded on the sands at the entrance. In the morning the\r\ncustom-house officers, together with a crowd of idlers, visited her.\r\nOne only of the crew appeared to have arrived with her. He had got to\r\nshore, and had walked a few paces towards the town, and then,\r\nvanquished by malady and approaching death, had fallen on the\r\ninhospitable beach. He was found stiff, his hands clenched, and pressed\r\nagainst his breast. His skin, nearly black, his matted hair and bristly\r\nbeard, were signs of a long protracted misery. It was whispered that he\r\nhad died of the plague. No one ventured on board the vessel, and\r\nstrange sights were averred to be seen at night, walking the deck, and\r\nhanging on the masts and shrouds. She soon went to pieces; I was shewn\r\nwhere she had been, and saw her disjoined timbers tossed on the waves.\r\nThe body of the man who had landed, had been buried deep in the sands;\r\nand none could tell more, than that the vessel was American built, and\r\nthat several months before the Fortunatas had sailed from Philadelphia,\r\nof which no tidings were afterwards received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI returned to my family estate in the autumn of the year 2092. My heart\r\nhad long been with them; and I felt sick with the hope and delight of\r\nseeing them again. The district which contained them appeared the abode\r\nof every kindly spirit. Happiness, love and peace, walked the forest\r\npaths, and tempered the atmosphere. After all the agitation and sorrow\r\nI had endured in Greece, I sought Windsor, as the storm-driven bird\r\ndoes the nest in which it may fold its wings in tranquillity.\r\n\r\nHow unwise had the wanderers been, who had deserted its shelter,\r\nentangled themselves in the web of society, and entered on what men of\r\nthe world call \xe2\x80\x9clife,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that labyrinth of evil, that scheme of mutual\r\ntorture. To live, according to this sense of the word, we must not only\r\nobserve and learn, we must also feel; we must not be mere spectators of\r\naction, we must act; we must not describe, but be subjects of\r\ndescription. Deep sorrow must have been the inmate of our bosoms; fraud\r\nmust have lain in wait for us; the artful must have deceived us;\r\nsickening doubt and false hope must have chequered our days; hilarity\r\nand joy, that lap the soul in ecstasy, must at times have possessed us.\r\nWho that knows what \xe2\x80\x9clife\xe2\x80\x9d is, would pine for this feverish species of\r\nexistence? I have lived. I have spent days and nights of festivity; I\r\nhave joined in ambitious hopes, and exulted in victory: now,\xe2\x80\x94shut the\r\ndoor on the world, and build high the wall that is to separate me from\r\nthe troubled scene enacted within its precincts. Let us live for each\r\nother and for happiness; let us seek peace in our dear home, near the\r\ninland murmur of streams, and the gracious waving of trees, the\r\nbeauteous vesture of earth, and sublime pageantry of the skies. Let us\r\nleave \xe2\x80\x9clife,\xe2\x80\x9d that we may live.\r\n\r\nIdris was well content with this resolve of mine. Her native\r\nsprightliness needed no undue excitement, and her placid heart reposed\r\ncontented on my love, the well-being of her children, and the beauty of\r\nsurrounding nature. Her pride and blameless ambition was to create\r\nsmiles in all around her, and to shed repose on the fragile existence\r\nof her brother. In spite of her tender nursing, the health of Adrian\r\nperceptibly declined. Walking, riding, the common occupations of life,\r\novercame him: he felt no pain, but seemed to tremble for ever on the\r\nverge of annihilation. Yet, as he had lived on for months nearly in the\r\nsame state, he did not inspire us with any immediate fear; and, though\r\nhe talked of death as an event most familiar to his thoughts, he did\r\nnot cease to exert himself to render others happy, or to cultivate his\r\nown astonishing powers of mind. Winter passed away; and spring, led by\r\nthe months, awakened life in all nature. The forest was dressed in\r\ngreen; the young calves frisked on the new-sprung grass; the\r\nwind-winged shadows of light clouds sped over the green cornfields; the\r\nhermit cuckoo repeated his monotonous all-hail to the season; the\r\nnightingale, bird of love and minion of the evening star, filled the\r\nwoods with song; while Venus lingered in the warm sunset, and the young\r\ngreen of the trees lay in gentle relief along the clear horizon.\r\n\r\nDelight awoke in every heart, delight and exultation; for there was\r\npeace through all the world; the temple of Universal Janus was shut,\r\nand man died not that year by the hand of man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet this last but twelve months,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian; \xe2\x80\x9cand earth will become\r\na Paradise. The energies of man were before directed to the destruction\r\nof his species: they now aim at its liberation and preservation. Man\r\ncannot repose, and his restless aspirations will now bring forth good\r\ninstead of evil. The favoured countries of the south will throw off the\r\niron yoke of servitude; poverty will quit us, and with that, sickness.\r\nWhat may not the forces, never before united, of liberty and peace\r\nachieve in this dwelling of man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreaming, for ever dreaming, Windsor!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ryland, the old adversary\r\nof Raymond, and candidate for the Protectorate at the ensuing election.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe assured that earth is not, nor ever can be heaven, while the seeds\r\nof hell are natives of her soil. When the seasons have become equal,\r\nwhen the air breeds no disorders, when its surface is no longer liable\r\nto blights and droughts, then sickness will cease; when men\xe2\x80\x99s passions\r\nare dead, poverty will depart. When love is no longer akin to hate,\r\nthen brotherhood will exist: we are very far from that state at\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so far as you may suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d observed a little old astronomer, by\r\nname Merrival, \xe2\x80\x9cthe poles precede slowly, but securely; in an hundred\r\nthousand years\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall all be underground,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ryland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pole of the earth will coincide with the pole of the ecliptic,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the astronomer, \xe2\x80\x9can universal spring will be produced, and\r\nearth become a paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we shall of course enjoy the benefit of the change,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ryland,\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have strange news here,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed. I had the newspaper in my\r\nhand, and, as usual, had turned to the intelligence from Greece. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nseems that the total destruction of Constantinople, and the supposition\r\nthat winter had purified the air of the fallen city, gave the Greeks\r\ncourage to visit its site, and begin to rebuild it. But they tell us\r\nthat the curse of God is on the place, for every one who has ventured\r\nwithin the walls has been tainted by the plague; that this disease has\r\nspread in Thrace and Macedonia; and now, fearing the virulence of\r\ninfection during the coming heats, a cordon has been drawn on the\r\nfrontiers of Thessaly, and a strict quarantine exacted.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nintelligence brought us back from the prospect of paradise, held out\r\nafter the lapse of an hundred thousand years, to the pain and misery at\r\npresent existent upon earth. We talked of the ravages made last year by\r\npestilence in every quarter of the world; and of the dreadful\r\nconsequences of a second visitation. We discussed the best means of\r\npreventing infection, and of preserving health and activity in a large\r\ncity thus afflicted\xe2\x80\x94London, for instance. Merrival did not join in this\r\nconversation; drawing near Idris, he proceeded to assure her that the\r\njoyful prospect of an earthly paradise after an hundred thousand years,\r\nwas clouded to him by the knowledge that in a certain period of time\r\nafter, an earthly hell or purgatory, would occur, when the ecliptic and\r\nequator would be at right angles.[4] Our party at length broke up; \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nare all dreaming this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ryland, \xe2\x80\x9cit is as wise to discuss\r\nthe probability of a visitation of the plague in our well-governed\r\nmetropolis, as to calculate the centuries which must escape before we\r\ncan grow pine-apples here in the open air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, though it seemed absurd to calculate upon the arrival of the\r\nplague in London, I could not reflect without extreme pain on the\r\ndesolation this evil would cause in Greece. The English for the most\r\npart talked of Thrace and Macedonia, as they would of a lunar\r\nterritory, which, unknown to them, presented no distinct idea or\r\ninterest to the minds. I had trod the soil. The faces of many of the\r\ninhabitants were familiar to me; in the towns, plains, hills, and\r\ndefiles of these countries, I had enjoyed unspeakable delight, as I\r\njournied through them the year before. Some romantic village, some\r\ncottage, or elegant abode there situated, inhabited by the lovely and\r\nthe good, rose before my mental sight, and the question haunted me, is\r\nthe plague there also?\xe2\x80\x94That same invincible monster, which hovered over\r\nand devoured Constantinople\xe2\x80\x94that fiend more cruel than tempest, less\r\ntame than fire, is, alas, unchained in that beautiful country\xe2\x80\x94these\r\nreflections would not allow me to rest.\r\n\r\nThe political state of England became agitated as the time drew near\r\nwhen the new Protector was to be elected. This event excited the more\r\ninterest, since it was the current report, that if the popular\r\ncandidate (Ryland) should be chosen, the question of the abolition of\r\nhereditary rank, and other feudal relics, would come under the\r\nconsideration of parliament. Not a word had been spoken during the\r\npresent session on any of these topics. Every thing would depend upon\r\nthe choice of a Protector, and the elections of the ensuing year. Yet\r\nthis very silence was awful, shewing the deep weight attributed to the\r\nquestion; the fear of either party to hazard an ill-timed attack, and\r\nthe expectation of a furious contention when it should begin.\r\n\r\nBut although St. Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s did not echo with the voice which filled\r\neach heart, the newspapers teemed with nothing else; and in private\r\ncompanies the conversation however remotely begun, soon verged towards\r\nthis central point, while voices were lowered and chairs drawn closer.\r\nThe nobles did not hesitate to express their fear; the other party\r\nendeavoured to treat the matter lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cShame on the country,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRyland, \xe2\x80\x9cto lay so much stress upon words and frippery; it is a\r\nquestion of nothing; of the new painting of carriage-pannels and the\r\nembroidery of footmen\xe2\x80\x99s coats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet could England indeed doff her lordly trappings, and be content with\r\nthe democratic style of America? Were the pride of ancestry, the\r\npatrician spirit, the gentle courtesies and refined pursuits, splendid\r\nattributes of rank, to be erased among us? We were told that this would\r\nnot be the case; that we were by nature a poetical people, a nation\r\neasily duped by words, ready to array clouds in splendour, and bestow\r\nhonour on the dust. This spirit we could never lose; and it was to\r\ndiffuse this concentrated spirit of birth, that the new law was to be\r\nbrought forward. We were assured that, when the name and title of\r\nEnglishman was the sole patent of nobility, we should all be noble;\r\nthat when no man born under English sway, felt another his superior in\r\nrank, courtesy and refinement would become the birth-right of all our\r\ncountrymen. Let not England be so far disgraced, as to have it imagined\r\nthat it can be without nobles, nature\xe2\x80\x99s true nobility, who bear their\r\npatent in their mien, who are from their cradle elevated above the rest\r\nof their species, because they are better than the rest. Among a race\r\nof independent, and generous, and well educated men, in a country where\r\nthe imagination is empress of men\xe2\x80\x99s minds, there needs be no fear that\r\nwe should want a perpetual succession of the high-born and lordly. That\r\nparty, however, could hardly yet be considered a minority in the\r\nkingdom, who extolled the ornament of the column, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Corinthian\r\ncapital of polished society;\xe2\x80\x9d they appealed to prejudices without\r\nnumber, to old attachments and young hopes; to the expectation of\r\nthousands who might one day become peers; they set up as a scarecrow,\r\nthe spectre of all that was sordid, mechanic and base in the commercial\r\nrepublics.\r\n\r\nThe plague had come to Athens. Hundreds of English residents returned\r\nto their own country. Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s beloved Athenians, the free, the noble\r\npeople of the divinest town in Greece, fell like ripe corn before the\r\nmerciless sickle of the adversary. Its pleasant places were deserted;\r\nits temples and palaces were converted into tombs; its energies, bent\r\nbefore towards the highest objects of human ambition, were now forced\r\nto converge to one point, the guarding against the innumerous arrows of\r\nthe plague.\r\n\r\nAt any other time this disaster would have excited extreme compassion\r\namong us; but it was now passed over, while each mind was engaged by\r\nthe coming controversy. It was not so with me; and the question of rank\r\nand right dwindled to insignificance in my eyes, when I pictured the\r\nscene of suffering Athens. I heard of the death of only sons; of wives\r\nand husbands most devoted; of the rending of ties twisted with the\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s fibres, of friend losing friend, and young mothers mourning for\r\ntheir first born; and these moving incidents were grouped and painted\r\nin my mind by the knowledge of the persons, by my esteem and affection\r\nfor the sufferers. It was the admirers, friends, fellow soldiers of\r\nRaymond, families that had welcomed Perdita to Greece, and lamented\r\nwith her the loss of her lord, that were swept away, and went to dwell\r\nwith them in the undistinguishing tomb.\r\n\r\nThe plague at Athens had been preceded and caused by the contagion from\r\nthe East; and the scene of havoc and death continued to be acted there,\r\non a scale of fearful magnitude. A hope that the visitation of the\r\npresent year would prove the last, kept up the spirits of the merchants\r\nconnected with these countries; but the inhabitants were driven to\r\ndespair, or to a resignation which, arising from fanaticism, assumed\r\nthe same dark hue. America had also received the taint; and, were it\r\nyellow fever or plague, the epidemic was gifted with a virulence before\r\nunfelt. The devastation was not confined to the towns, but spread\r\nthroughout the country; the hunter died in the woods, the peasant in\r\nthe corn-fields, and the fisher on his native waters.\r\n\r\nA strange story was brought to us from the East, to which little credit\r\nwould have been given, had not the fact been attested by a multitude of\r\nwitnesses, in various parts of the world. On the twenty-first of June,\r\nit was said that an hour before noon, a black sun arose: an orb, the\r\nsize of that luminary, but dark, defined, whose beams were shadows,\r\nascended from the west; in about an hour it had reached the meridian,\r\nand eclipsed the bright parent of day. Night fell upon every country,\r\nnight, sudden, rayless, entire. The stars came out, shedding their\r\nineffectual glimmerings on the light-widowed earth. But soon the dim\r\norb passed from over the sun, and lingered down the eastern heaven. As\r\nit descended, its dusky rays crossed the brilliant ones of the sun, and\r\ndeadened or distorted them. The shadows of things assumed strange and\r\nghastly shapes. The wild animals in the woods took fright at the\r\nunknown shapes figured on the ground. They fled they knew not whither;\r\nand the citizens were filled with greater dread, at the convulsion\r\nwhich \xe2\x80\x9cshook lions into civil streets;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94birds, strong-winged eagles,\r\nsuddenly blinded, fell in the market-places, while owls and bats shewed\r\nthemselves welcoming the early night. Gradually the object of fear sank\r\nbeneath the horizon, and to the last shot up shadowy beams into the\r\notherwise radiant air. Such was the tale sent us from Asia, from the\r\neastern extremity of Europe, and from Africa as far west as the Golden\r\nCoast. Whether this story were true or not, the effects were certain.\r\nThrough Asia, from the banks of the Nile to the shores of the Caspian,\r\nfrom the Hellespont even to the sea of Oman, a sudden panic was driven.\r\nThe men filled the mosques; the women, veiled, hastened to the tombs,\r\nand carried offerings to the dead, thus to preserve the living. The\r\nplague was forgotten, in this new fear which the black sun had spread;\r\nand, though the dead multiplied, and the streets of Ispahan, of Pekin,\r\nand of Delhi were strewed with pestilence-struck corpses, men passed\r\non, gazing on the ominous sky, regardless of the death beneath their\r\nfeet. The christians sought their churches,\xe2\x80\x94christian maidens, even at\r\nthe feast of roses, clad in white, with shining veils, sought, in long\r\nprocession, the places consecrated to their religion, filling the air\r\nwith their hymns; while, ever and anon, from the lips of some poor\r\nmourner in the crowd, a voice of wailing burst, and the rest looked up,\r\nfancying they could discern the sweeping wings of angels, who passed\r\nover the earth, lamenting the disasters about to fall on man.\r\n\r\nIn the sunny clime of Persia, in the crowded cities of China, amidst\r\nthe aromatic groves of Cashmere, and along the southern shores of the\r\nMediterranean, such scenes had place. Even in Greece the tale of the\r\nsun of darkness encreased the fears and despair of the dying multitude.\r\nWe, in our cloudy isle, were far removed from danger, and the only\r\ncircumstance that brought these disasters at all home to us, was the\r\ndaily arrival of vessels from the east, crowded with emigrants, mostly\r\nEnglish; for the Moslems, though the fear of death was spread keenly\r\namong them, still clung together; that, if they were to die (and if\r\nthey were, death would as readily meet them on the homeless sea, or in\r\nfar England, as in Persia,)\xe2\x80\x94 if they were to die, their bones might\r\nrest in earth made sacred by the relics of true believers. Mecca had\r\nnever before been so crowded with pilgrims; yet the Arabs neglected to\r\npillage the caravans, but, humble and weaponless, they joined the\r\nprocession, praying Mahomet to avert plague from their tents and\r\ndeserts.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the rapturous delight with which I turned from\r\npolitical brawls at home, and the physical evils of distant countries,\r\nto my own dear home, to the selected abode of goodness and love; to\r\npeace, and the interchange of every sacred sympathy. Had I never\r\nquitted Windsor, these emotions would not have been so intense; but I\r\nhad in Greece been the prey of fear and deplorable change; in Greece,\r\nafter a period of anxiety and sorrow, I had seen depart two, whose very\r\nnames were the symbol of greatness and virtue. But such miseries could\r\nnever intrude upon the domestic circle left to me, while, secluded in\r\nour beloved forest, we passed our lives in tranquillity. Some small\r\nchange indeed the progress of years brought here; and time, as it is\r\nwont, stamped the traces of mortality on our pleasures and\r\nexpectations. Idris, the most affectionate wife, sister and friend, was\r\na tender and loving mother. The feeling was not with her as with many,\r\na pastime; it was a passion. We had had three children; one, the second\r\nin age, died while I was in Greece. This had dashed the triumphant and\r\nrapturous emotions of maternity with grief and fear. Before this event,\r\nthe little beings, sprung from herself, the young heirs of her\r\ntransient life, seemed to have a sure lease of existence; now she\r\ndreaded that the pitiless destroyer might snatch her remaining\r\ndarlings, as it had snatched their brother. The least illness caused\r\nthroes of terror; she was miserable if she were at all absent from\r\nthem; her treasure of happiness she had garnered in their fragile\r\nbeing, and kept forever on the watch, lest the insidious thief should\r\nas before steal these valued gems. She had fortunately small cause for\r\nfear. Alfred, now nine years old, was an upright, manly little fellow,\r\nwith radiant brow, soft eyes, and gentle, though independent\r\ndisposition. Our youngest was yet in infancy; but his downy cheek was\r\nsprinkled with the roses of health, and his unwearied vivacity filled\r\nour halls with innocent laughter.\r\n\r\nClara had passed the age which, from its mute ignorance, was the source\r\nof the fears of Idris. Clara was dear to her, to all. There was so much\r\nintelligence combined with innocence, sensibility with forbearance, and\r\nseriousness with perfect good-humour, a beauty so transcendant, united\r\nto such endearing simplicity, that she hung like a pearl in the shrine\r\nof our possessions, a treasure of wonder and excellence.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of winter our Alfred, now nine years of age, first\r\nwent to school at Eton. This appeared to him the primary step towards\r\nmanhood, and he was proportionably pleased. Community of study and\r\namusement developed the best parts of his character, his steady\r\nperseverance, generosity, and well-governed firmness. What deep and\r\nsacred emotions are excited in a father\xe2\x80\x99s bosom, when he first becomes\r\nconvinced that his love for his child is not a mere instinct, but\r\nworthily bestowed, and that others, less akin, participate his\r\napprobation! It was supreme happiness to Idris and myself, to find that\r\nthe frankness which Alfred\xe2\x80\x99s open brow indicated, the intelligence of\r\nhis eyes, the tempered sensibility of his tones, were not delusions,\r\nbut indications of talents and virtues, which would \xe2\x80\x9cgrow with his\r\ngrowth, and strengthen with his strength.\xe2\x80\x9d At this period, the\r\ntermination of an animal\xe2\x80\x99s love for its offspring,\xe2\x80\x94the true affection\r\nof the human parent commences. We no longer look on this dearest part\r\nof ourselves, as a tender plant which we must cherish, or a plaything\r\nfor an idle hour. We build now on his intellectual faculties, we\r\nestablish our hopes on his moral propensities. His weakness still\r\nimparts anxiety to this feeling, his ignorance prevents entire\r\nintimacy; but we begin to respect the future man, and to endeavour to\r\nsecure his esteem, even as if he were our equal. What can a parent have\r\nmore at heart than the good opinion of his child? In all our\r\ntransactions with him our honour must be inviolate, the integrity of\r\nour relations untainted: fate and circumstance may, when he arrives at\r\nmaturity, separate us for ever\xe2\x80\x94but, as his aegis in danger, his\r\nconsolation in hardship, let the ardent youth for ever bear with him\r\nthrough the rough path of life, love and honour for his parents.\r\n\r\nWe had lived so long in the vicinity of Eton, that its population of\r\nyoung folks was well known to us. Many of them had been Alfred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplaymates, before they became his school-fellows. We now watched this\r\nyouthful congregation with redoubled interest. We marked the difference\r\nof character among the boys, and endeavoured to read the future man in\r\nthe stripling. There is nothing more lovely, to which the heart more\r\nyearns than a free-spirited boy, gentle, brave, and generous. Several\r\nof the Etonians had these characteristics; all were distinguished by a\r\nsense of honour, and spirit of enterprize; in some, as they verged\r\ntowards manhood, this degenerated into presumption; but the younger\r\nones, lads a little older than our own, were conspicuous for their\r\ngallant and sweet dispositions.\r\n\r\nHere were the future governors of England; the men, who, when our\r\nardour was cold, and our projects completed or destroyed for ever,\r\nwhen, our drama acted, we doffed the garb of the hour, and assumed the\r\nuniform of age, or of more equalizing death; here were the beings who\r\nwere to carry on the vast machine of society; here were the lovers,\r\nhusbands, fathers; here the landlord, the politician, the soldier; some\r\nfancied that they were even now ready to appear on the stage, eager to\r\nmake one among the dramatis personae of active life. It was not long\r\nsince I was like one of these beardless aspirants; when my boy shall\r\nhave obtained the place I now hold, I shall have tottered into a\r\ngrey-headed, wrinkled old man. Strange system! riddle of the Sphynx,\r\nmost awe-striking! that thus man remains, while we the individuals pass\r\naway. Such is, to borrow the words of an eloquent and philosophic\r\nwriter, \xe2\x80\x9cthe mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of\r\ntransitory parts; wherein, by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom,\r\nmoulding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race,\r\nthe whole, at one time, is never old, or middle-aged, or young, but, in\r\na condition of unchangeable constancy, moves on through the varied\r\ntenour of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and progression.\xe2\x80\x9d[5]\r\n\r\nWillingly do I give place to thee, dear Alfred! advance, offspring of\r\ntender love, child of our hopes; advance a soldier on the road to which\r\nI have been the pioneer! I will make way for thee. I have already put\r\noff the carelessness of childhood, the unlined brow, and springy gait\r\nof early years, that they may adorn thee. Advance; and I will despoil\r\nmyself still further for thy advantage. Time shall rob me of the graces\r\nof maturity, shall take the fire from my eyes, and agility from my\r\nlimbs, shall steal the better part of life, eager expectation and\r\npassionate love, and shower them in double portion on thy dear head.\r\nAdvance! avail thyself of the gift, thou and thy comrades; and in the\r\ndrama you are about to act, do not disgrace those who taught you to\r\nenter on the stage, and to pronounce becomingly the parts assigned to\r\nyou! May your progress be uninterrupted and secure; born during the\r\nspring-tide of the hopes of man, may you lead up the summer to which no\r\nwinter may succeed!\r\n\r\n [4] See an ingenious Essay, entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mythological Astronomy of\r\n the Ancients Demonstrated,\xe2\x80\x9d by Mackey, a shoemaker, of Norwich printed\r\n in 1822.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] Burke\xe2\x80\x99s Reflections on the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome disorder had surely crept into the course of the elements,\r\ndestroying their benignant influence. The wind, prince of air, raged\r\nthrough his kingdom, lashing the sea into fury, and subduing the rebel\r\nearth into some sort of obedience.\r\n\r\nThe God sends down his angry plagues from high,\r\nFamine and pestilence in heaps they die.\r\nAgain in vengeance of his wrath he falls\r\nOn their great hosts, and breaks their tottering walls;\r\nArrests their navies on the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s plain,\r\nAnd whelms their strength with mountains of the main.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir deadly power shook the flourishing countries of the south, and\r\nduring winter, even, we, in our northern retreat, began to quake under\r\ntheir ill effects.\r\n\r\nThat fable is unjust, which gives the superiority to the sun over the\r\nwind. Who has not seen the lightsome earth, the balmy atmosphere, and\r\nbasking nature become dark, cold and ungenial, when the sleeping wind\r\nhas awoke in the east? Or, when the dun clouds thickly veil the sky,\r\nwhile exhaustless stores of rain are poured down, until, the dank earth\r\nrefusing to imbibe the superabundant moisture, it lies in pools on the\r\nsurface; when the torch of day seems like a meteor, to be quenched; who\r\nhas not seen the cloud-stirring north arise, the streaked blue appear,\r\nand soon an opening made in the vapours in the eye of the wind, through\r\nwhich the bright azure shines? The clouds become thin; an arch is\r\nformed for ever rising upwards, till, the universal cope being\r\nunveiled, the sun pours forth its rays, re-animated and fed by the\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nThen mighty art thou, O wind, to be throned above all other vicegerents\r\nof nature\xe2\x80\x99s power; whether thou comest destroying from the east, or\r\npregnant with elementary life from the west; thee the clouds obey; the\r\nsun is subservient to thee; the shoreless ocean is thy slave! Thou\r\nsweepest over the earth, and oaks, the growth of centuries, submit to\r\nthy viewless axe; the snow-drift is scattered on the pinnacles of the\r\nAlps, the avalanche thunders down their vallies. Thou holdest the keys\r\nof the frost, and canst first chain and then set free the streams;\r\nunder thy gentle governance the buds and leaves are born, they flourish\r\nnursed by thee.\r\n\r\nWhy dost thou howl thus, O wind? By day and by night for four long\r\nmonths thy roarings have not ceased\xe2\x80\x94the shores of the sea are strewn\r\nwith wrecks, its keel-welcoming surface has become impassable, the\r\nearth has shed her beauty in obedience to thy command; the frail\r\nballoon dares no longer sail on the agitated air; thy ministers, the\r\nclouds, deluge the land with rain; rivers forsake their banks; the wild\r\ntorrent tears up the mountain path; plain and wood, and verdant dell\r\nare despoiled of their loveliness; our very cities are wasted by thee.\r\nAlas, what will become of us? It seems as if the giant waves of ocean,\r\nand vast arms of the sea, were about to wrench the deep-rooted island\r\nfrom its centre; and cast it, a ruin and a wreck, upon the fields of\r\nthe Atlantic.\r\n\r\nWhat are we, the inhabitants of this globe, least among the many that\r\npeople infinite space? Our minds embrace infinity; the visible\r\nmechanism of our being is subject to merest accident. Day by day we are\r\nforced to believe this. He whom a scratch has disorganized, he who\r\ndisappears from apparent life under the influence of the hostile agency\r\nat work around us, had the same powers as I\xe2\x80\x94I also am subject to the\r\nsame laws. In the face of all this we call ourselves lords of the\r\ncreation, wielders of the elements, masters of life and death, and we\r\nallege in excuse of this arrogance, that though the individual is\r\ndestroyed, man continues for ever.\r\n\r\nThus, losing our identity, that of which we are chiefly conscious, we\r\nglory in the continuity of our species, and learn to regard death\r\nwithout terror. But when any whole nation becomes the victim of the\r\ndestructive powers of exterior agents, then indeed man shrinks into\r\ninsignificance, he feels his tenure of life insecure, his inheritance\r\non earth cut off.\r\n\r\nI remember, after having witnessed the destructive effects of a fire, I\r\ncould not even behold a small one in a stove, without a sensation of\r\nfear. The mounting flames had curled round the building, as it fell,\r\nand was destroyed. They insinuated themselves into the substances about\r\nthem, and the impediments to their progress yielded at their touch.\r\nCould we take integral parts of this power, and not be subject to its\r\noperation? Could we domesticate a cub of this wild beast, and not fear\r\nits growth and maturity?\r\n\r\nThus we began to feel, with regard to many-visaged death let loose on\r\nthe chosen districts of our fair habitation, and above all, with regard\r\nto the plague. We feared the coming summer. Nations, bordering on the\r\nalready infected countries, began to enter upon serious plans for the\r\nbetter keeping out of the enemy. We, a commercial people, were obliged\r\nto bring such schemes under consideration; and the question of\r\ncontagion became matter of earnest disquisition.\r\n\r\nThat the plague was not what is commonly called contagious, like the\r\nscarlet fever, or extinct small-pox, was proved. It was called an\r\nepidemic. But the grand question was still unsettled of how this\r\nepidemic was generated and increased. If infection depended upon the\r\nair, the air was subject to infection. As for instance, a typhus fever\r\nhas been brought by ships to one sea-port town; yet the very people who\r\nbrought it there, were incapable of communicating it in a town more\r\nfortunately situated. But how are we to judge of airs, and pronounce\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nsuch a city plague will die unproductive; in such another, nature has\r\nprovided for it a plentiful harvest? In the same way, individuals may\r\nescape ninety-nine times, and receive the death-blow at the hundredth;\r\nbecause bodies are sometimes in a state to reject the infection of\r\nmalady, and at others, thirsty to imbibe it. These reflections made our\r\nlegislators pause, before they could decide on the laws to be put in\r\nforce. The evil was so wide-spreading, so violent and immedicable, that\r\nno care, no prevention could be judged superfluous, which even added a\r\nchance to our escape.\r\n\r\nThese were questions of prudence; there was no immediate necessity for\r\nan earnest caution. England was still secure. France, Germany, Italy\r\nand Spain, were interposed, walls yet without a breach, between us and\r\nthe plague. Our vessels truly were the sport of winds and waves, even\r\nas Gulliver was the toy of the Brobdignagians; but we on our stable\r\nabode could not be hurt in life or limb by these eruptions of nature.\r\nWe could not fear\xe2\x80\x94we did not. Yet a feeling of awe, a breathless\r\nsentiment of wonder, a painful sense of the degradation of humanity,\r\nwas introduced into every heart. Nature, our mother, and our friend,\r\nhad turned on us a brow of menace. She shewed us plainly, that, though\r\nshe permitted us to assign her laws and subdue her apparent powers,\r\nyet, if she put forth but a finger, we must quake. She could take our\r\nglobe, fringed with mountains, girded by the atmosphere, containing the\r\ncondition of our being, and all that man\xe2\x80\x99s mind could invent or his\r\nforce achieve; she could take the ball in her hand, and cast it into\r\nspace, where life would be drunk up, and man and all his efforts for\r\never annihilated.\r\n\r\nThese speculations were rife among us; yet not the less we proceeded in\r\nour daily occupations, and our plans, whose accomplishment demanded the\r\nlapse of many years. No voice was heard telling us to hold! When\r\nforeign distresses came to be felt by us through the channels of\r\ncommerce, we set ourselves to apply remedies. Subscriptions were made\r\nfor the emigrants, and merchants bankrupt by the failure of trade. The\r\nEnglish spirit awoke to its full activity, and, as it had ever done,\r\nset itself to resist the evil, and to stand in the breach which\r\ndiseased nature had suffered chaos and death to make in the bounds and\r\nbanks which had hitherto kept them out.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of summer, we began to feel, that the mischief\r\nwhich had taken place in distant countries was greater than we had at\r\nfirst suspected. Quito was destroyed by an earthquake. Mexico laid\r\nwaste by the united effects of storm, pestilence and famine. Crowds of\r\nemigrants inundated the west of Europe; and our island had become the\r\nrefuge of thousands. In the mean time Ryland had been chosen Protector.\r\nHe had sought this office with eagerness, under the idea of turning his\r\nwhole forces to the suppression of the privileged orders of our\r\ncommunity. His measures were thwarted, and his schemes interrupted by\r\nthis new state of things. Many of the foreigners were utterly\r\ndestitute; and their increasing numbers at length forbade a recourse to\r\nthe usual modes of relief. Trade was stopped by the failure of the\r\ninterchange of cargoes usual between us, and America, India, Egypt and\r\nGreece. A sudden break was made in the routine of our lives. In vain\r\nour Protector and his partizans sought to conceal this truth; in vain,\r\nday after day, he appointed a period for the discussion of the new laws\r\nconcerning hereditary rank and privilege; in vain he endeavoured to\r\nrepresent the evil as partial and temporary. These disasters came home\r\nto so many bosoms, and, through the various channels of commerce, were\r\ncarried so entirely into every class and division of the community,\r\nthat of necessity they became the first question in the state, the\r\nchief subjects to which we must turn our attention.\r\n\r\nCan it be true, each asked the other with wonder and dismay, that whole\r\ncountries are laid waste, whole nations annihilated, by these disorders\r\nin nature? The vast cities of America, the fertile plains of Hindostan,\r\nthe crowded abodes of the Chinese, are menaced with utter ruin. Where\r\nlate the busy multitudes assembled for pleasure or profit, now only the\r\nsound of wailing and misery is heard. The air is empoisoned, and each\r\nhuman being inhales death, even while in youth and health, their hopes\r\nare in the flower. We called to mind the plague of 1348, when it was\r\ncalculated that a third of mankind had been destroyed. As yet western\r\nEurope was uninfected; would it always be so?\r\n\r\nO, yes, it would\xe2\x80\x94Countrymen, fear not! In the still uncultivated wilds\r\nof America, what wonder that among its other giant destroyers, plague\r\nshould be numbered! It is of old a native of the East, sister of the\r\ntornado, the earthquake, and the simoon. Child of the sun, and nursling\r\nof the tropics, it would expire in these climes. It drinks the dark\r\nblood of the inhabitant of the south, but it never feasts on the\r\npale-faced Celt. If perchance some stricken Asiatic come among us,\r\nplague dies with him, uncommunicated and innoxious. Let us weep for our\r\nbrethren, though we can never experience their reverse. Let us lament\r\nover and assist the children of the garden of the earth. Late we envied\r\ntheir abodes, their spicy groves, fertile plains, and abundant\r\nloveliness. But in this mortal life extremes are always matched; the\r\nthorn grows with the rose, the poison tree and the cinnamon mingle\r\ntheir boughs. Persia, with its cloth of gold, marble halls, and\r\ninfinite wealth, is now a tomb. The tent of the Arab is fallen in the\r\nsands, and his horse spurns the ground unbridled and unsaddled. The\r\nvoice of lamentation fills the valley of Cashmere; its dells and woods,\r\nits cool fountains, and gardens of roses, are polluted by the dead; in\r\nCircassia and Georgia the spirit of beauty weeps over the ruin of its\r\nfavourite temple\xe2\x80\x94the form of woman.\r\n\r\nOur own distresses, though they were occasioned by the fictitious\r\nreciprocity of commerce, encreased in due proportion. Bankers,\r\nmerchants, and manufacturers, whose trade depended on exports and\r\ninterchange of wealth, became bankrupt. Such things, when they happen\r\nsingly, affect only the immediate parties; but the prosperity of the\r\nnation was now shaken by frequent and extensive losses. Families, bred\r\nin opulence and luxury, were reduced to beggary. The very state of\r\npeace in which we gloried was injurious; there were no means of\r\nemploying the idle, or of sending any overplus of population out of the\r\ncountry. Even the source of colonies was dried up, for in New Holland,\r\nVan Diemen\xe2\x80\x99s Land, and the Cape of Good Hope, plague raged. O, for some\r\nmedicinal vial to purge unwholesome nature, and bring back the earth to\r\nits accustomed health!\r\n\r\nRyland was a man of strong intellects and quick and sound decision in\r\nthe usual course of things, but he stood aghast at the multitude of\r\nevils that gathered round us. Must he tax the landed interest to assist\r\nour commercial population? To do this, he must gain the favour of the\r\nchief land-holders, the nobility of the country; and these were his\r\nvowed enemies\xe2\x80\x94he must conciliate them by abandoning his favourite\r\nscheme of equalization; he must confirm them in their manorial rights;\r\nhe must sell his cherished plans for the permanent good of his country,\r\nfor temporary relief. He must aim no more at the dear object of his\r\nambition; throwing his arms aside, he must for present ends give up the\r\nultimate object of his endeavours. He came to Windsor to consult with\r\nus. Every day added to his difficulties; the arrival of fresh vessels\r\nwith emigrants, the total cessation of commerce, the starving multitude\r\nthat thronged around the palace of the Protectorate, were circumstances\r\nnot to be tampered with. The blow was struck; the aristocracy obtained\r\nall they wished, and they subscribed to a twelvemonths\xe2\x80\x99 bill, which\r\nlevied twenty per cent on all the rent-rolls of the country. Calm was\r\nnow restored to the metropolis, and to the populous cities, before\r\ndriven to desperation; and we returned to the consideration of distant\r\ncalamities, wondering if the future would bring any alleviation to\r\ntheir excess. It was August; so there could be small hope of relief\r\nduring the heats. On the contrary, the disease gained virulence, while\r\nstarvation did its accustomed work. Thousands died unlamented; for\r\nbeside the yet warm corpse the mourner was stretched, made mute by\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of this month news arrived in London that the plague\r\nwas in France and Italy. These tidings were at first whispered about\r\ntown; but no one dared express aloud the soul-quailing intelligence.\r\nWhen any one met a friend in the street, he only cried as he hurried\r\non, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 while the other, with an ejaculation of fear and\r\nhorror, would answer,\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will become of us?\xe2\x80\x9d At length it was\r\nmentioned in the newspapers. The paragraph was inserted in an obscure\r\npart: \xe2\x80\x9cWe regret to state that there can be no longer a doubt of the\r\nplague having been introduced at Leghorn, Genoa, and Marseilles.\xe2\x80\x9d No\r\nword of comment followed; each reader made his own fearful one. We were\r\nas a man who hears that his house is burning, and yet hurries through\r\nthe streets, borne along by a lurking hope of a mistake, till he turns\r\nthe corner, and sees his sheltering roof enveloped in a flame. Before\r\nit had been a rumour; but now in words uneraseable, in definite and\r\nundeniable print, the knowledge went forth. Its obscurity of situation\r\nrendered it the more conspicuous: the diminutive letters grew gigantic\r\nto the bewildered eye of fear: they seemed graven with a pen of iron,\r\nimpressed by fire, woven in the clouds, stamped on the very front of\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\nThe English, whether travellers or residents, came pouring in one great\r\nrevulsive stream, back on their own country; and with them crowds of\r\nItalians and Spaniards. Our little island was filled even to bursting.\r\nAt first an unusual quantity of specie made its appearance with the\r\nemigrants; but these people had no means of receiving back into their\r\nhands what they spent among us. With the advance of summer, and the\r\nincrease of the distemper, rents were unpaid, and their remittances\r\nfailed them. It was impossible to see these crowds of wretched,\r\nperishing creatures, late nurslings of luxury, and not stretch out a\r\nhand to save them. As at the conclusion of the eighteenth century, the\r\nEnglish unlocked their hospitable store, for the relief of those driven\r\nfrom their homes by political revolution; so now they were not backward\r\nin affording aid to the victims of a more wide-spreading calamity. We\r\nhad many foreign friends whom we eagerly sought out, and relieved from\r\ndreadful penury. Our Castle became an asylum for the unhappy. A little\r\npopulation occupied its halls. The revenue of its possessor, which had\r\nalways found a mode of expenditure congenial to his generous nature,\r\nwas now attended to more parsimoniously, that it might embrace a wider\r\nportion of utility. It was not however money, except partially, but the\r\nnecessaries of life, that became scarce. It was difficult to find an\r\nimmediate remedy. The usual one of imports was entirely cut off. In\r\nthis emergency, to feed the very people to whom we had given refuge, we\r\nwere obliged to yield to the plough and the mattock our\r\npleasure-grounds and parks. Live stock diminished sensibly in the\r\ncountry, from the effects of the great demand in the market. Even the\r\npoor deer, our antlered proteges, were obliged to fall for the sake of\r\nworthier pensioners. The labour necessary to bring the lands to this\r\nsort of culture, employed and fed the offcasts of the diminished\r\nmanufactories.\r\n\r\nAdrian did not rest only with the exertions he could make with regard\r\nto his own possessions. He addressed himself to the wealthy of the\r\nland; he made proposals in parliament little adapted to please the\r\nrich; but his earnest pleadings and benevolent eloquence were\r\nirresistible. To give up their pleasure-grounds to the agriculturist,\r\nto diminish sensibly the number of horses kept for the purposes of\r\nluxury throughout the country, were means obvious, but unpleasing. Yet,\r\nto the honour of the English be it recorded, that, although natural\r\ndisinclination made them delay awhile, yet when the misery of their\r\nfellow-creatures became glaring, an enthusiastic generosity inspired\r\ntheir decrees. The most luxurious were often the first to part with\r\ntheir indulgencies. As is common in communities, a fashion was set. The\r\nhigh-born ladies of the country would have deemed themselves disgraced\r\nif they had now enjoyed, what they before called a necessary, the ease\r\nof a carriage. Chairs, as in olden time, and Indian palanquins were\r\nintroduced for the infirm; but else it was nothing singular to see\r\nfemales of rank going on foot to places of fashionable resort. It was\r\nmore common, for all who possessed landed property to secede to their\r\nestates, attended by whole troops of the indigent, to cut down their\r\nwoods to erect temporary dwellings, and to portion out their parks,\r\nparterres and flower-gardens, to necessitous families. Many of these,\r\nof high rank in their own countries, now, with hoe in hand, turned up\r\nthe soil. It was found necessary at last to check the spirit of\r\nsacrifice, and to remind those whose generosity proceeded to lavish\r\nwaste, that, until the present state of things became permanent, of\r\nwhich there was no likelihood, it was wrong to carry change so far as\r\nto make a reaction difficult. Experience demonstrated that in a year or\r\ntwo pestilence would cease; it were well that in the mean time we\r\nshould not have destroyed our fine breeds of horses, or have utterly\r\nchanged the face of the ornamented portion of the country.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined that things were in a bad state indeed, before this\r\nspirit of benevolence could have struck such deep roots. The infection\r\nhad now spread in the southern provinces of France. But that country\r\nhad so many resources in the way of agriculture, that the rush of\r\npopulation from one part of it to another, and its increase through\r\nforeign emigration, was less felt than with us. The panic struck\r\nappeared of more injury, than disease and its natural concomitants.\r\n\r\nWinter was hailed, a general and never-failing physician. The\r\nembrowning woods, and swollen rivers, the evening mists, and morning\r\nfrosts, were welcomed with gratitude. The effects of purifying cold\r\nwere immediately felt; and the lists of mortality abroad were curtailed\r\neach week. Many of our visitors left us: those whose homes were far in\r\nthe south, fled delightedly from our northern winter, and sought their\r\nnative land, secure of plenty even after their fearful visitation. We\r\nbreathed again. What the coming summer would bring, we knew not; but\r\nthe present months were our own, and our hopes of a cessation of\r\npestilence were high.\r\n\r\n [6]Elton\xe2\x80\x99s translation of Hesiod\xe2\x80\x99s Works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have lingered thus long on the extreme bank, the wasting shoal that\r\nstretched into the stream of life, dallying with the shadow of death.\r\nThus long, I have cradled my heart in retrospection of past happiness,\r\nwhen hope was. Why not for ever thus? I am not immortal; and the thread\r\nof my history might be spun out to the limits of my existence. But the\r\nsame sentiment that first led me to pourtray scenes replete with tender\r\nrecollections, now bids me hurry on. The same yearning of this warm,\r\npanting heart, that has made me in written words record my vagabond\r\nyouth, my serene manhood, and the passions of my soul, makes me now\r\nrecoil from further delay. I must complete my work.\r\n\r\nHere then I stand, as I said, beside the fleet waters of the flowing\r\nyears, and now away! Spread the sail, and strain with oar, hurrying by\r\ndark impending crags, adown steep rapids, even to the sea of desolation\r\nI have reached. Yet one moment, one brief interval before I put from\r\nshore\xe2\x80\x94 once, once again let me fancy myself as I was in 2094 in my\r\nabode at Windsor, let me close my eyes, and imagine that the\r\nimmeasurable boughs of its oaks still shadow me, its castle walls\r\nanear. Let fancy pourtray the joyous scene of the twentieth of June,\r\nsuch as even now my aching heart recalls it.\r\n\r\nCircumstances had called me to London; here I heard talk that symptoms\r\nof the plague had occurred in hospitals of that city. I returned to\r\nWindsor; my brow was clouded, my heart heavy; I entered the Little\r\nPark, as was my custom, at the Frogmore gate, on my way to the Castle.\r\nA great part of these grounds had been given to cultivation, and strips\r\nof potatoe-land and corn were scattered here and there. The rooks cawed\r\nloudly in the trees above; mixed with their hoarse cries I heard a\r\nlively strain of music. It was Alfred\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. The young people, the\r\nEtonians, and children of the neighbouring gentry, held a mock fair, to\r\nwhich all the country people were invited. The park was speckled by\r\ntents, whose flaunting colours and gaudy flags, waving in the sunshine,\r\nadded to the gaiety of the scene. On a platform erected beneath the\r\nterrace, a number of the younger part of the assembly were dancing. I\r\nleaned against a tree to observe them. The band played the wild eastern\r\nair of Weber introduced in Abon Hassan; its volatile notes gave wings\r\nto the feet of the dancers, while the lookers-on unconsciously beat\r\ntime. At first the tripping measure lifted my spirit with it, and for a\r\nmoment my eyes gladly followed the mazes of the dance. The revulsion of\r\nthought passed like keen steel to my heart. Ye are all going to die, I\r\nthought; already your tomb is built up around you. Awhile, because you\r\nare gifted with agility and strength, you fancy that you live: but\r\nfrail is the \xe2\x80\x9cbower of flesh\xe2\x80\x9d that encaskets life; dissoluble the\r\nsilver cord that binds you to it. The joyous soul, charioted from\r\npleasure to pleasure by the graceful mechanism of well-formed limbs,\r\nwill suddenly feel the axle-tree give way, and spring and wheel\r\ndissolve in dust. Not one of you, O! fated crowd, can escape\xe2\x80\x94not one!\r\nnot my own ones! not my Idris and her babes! Horror and misery! Already\r\nthe gay dance vanished, the green sward was strewn with corpses, the\r\nblue air above became fetid with deathly exhalations. Shriek, ye\r\nclarions! ye loud trumpets, howl! Pile dirge on dirge; rouse the\r\nfunereal chords; let the air ring with dire wailing; let wild discord\r\nrush on the wings of the wind! Already I hear it, while guardian\r\nangels, attendant on humanity, their task achieved, hasten away, and\r\ntheir departure is announced by melancholy strains; faces all unseemly\r\nwith weeping, forced open my lids; faster and faster many groups of\r\nthese woe-begone countenances thronged around, exhibiting every variety\r\nof wretchedness\xe2\x80\x94well known faces mingled with the distorted creations\r\nof fancy. Ashy pale, Raymond and Perdita sat apart, looking on with sad\r\nsmiles. Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s countenance flitted across, tainted by death\xe2\x80\x94Idris,\r\nwith eyes languidly closed and livid lips, was about to slide into the\r\nwide grave. The confusion grew\xe2\x80\x94their looks of sorrow changed to\r\nmockery; they nodded their heads in time to the music, whose clang\r\nbecame maddening.\r\n\r\nI felt that this was insanity\xe2\x80\x94I sprang forward to throw it off; I\r\nrushed into the midst of the crowd. Idris saw me: with light step she\r\nadvanced; as I folded her in my arms, feeling, as I did, that I thus\r\nenclosed what was to me a world, yet frail as the waterdrop which the\r\nnoon-day sun will drink from the water lily\xe2\x80\x99s cup; tears filled my\r\neyes, unwont to be thus moistened. The joyful welcome of my boys, the\r\nsoft gratulation of Clara, the pressure of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s hand, contributed\r\nto unman me. I felt that they were near, that they were safe, yet\r\nmethought this was all deceit;\xe2\x80\x94the earth reeled, the firm-enrooted\r\ntrees moved\xe2\x80\x94dizziness came over me\xe2\x80\x94I sank to the ground.\r\n\r\nMy beloved friends were alarmed\xe2\x80\x94nay, they expressed their alarm so\r\nanxiously, that I dared not pronounce the word _plague_, that hovered\r\non my lips, lest they should construe my perturbed looks into a\r\nsymptom, and see infection in my languor. I had scarcely recovered, and\r\nwith feigned hilarity had brought back smiles into my little circle,\r\nwhen we saw Ryland approach.\r\n\r\nRyland had something the appearance of a farmer; of a man whose muscles\r\nand full grown stature had been developed under the influence of\r\nvigorous exercise and exposure to the elements. This was to a great\r\ndegree the case: for, though a large landed proprietor, yet, being a\r\nprojector, and of an ardent and industrious disposition, he had on his\r\nown estate given himself up to agricultural labours. When he went as\r\nambassador to the Northern States of America, he, for some time,\r\nplanned his entire migration; and went so far as to make several\r\njournies far westward on that immense continent, for the purpose of\r\nchoosing the site of his new abode. Ambition turned his thoughts from\r\nthese designs\xe2\x80\x94ambition, which labouring through various lets and\r\nhindrances, had now led him to the summit of his hopes, in making him\r\nLord Protector of England.\r\n\r\nHis countenance was rough but intelligent\xe2\x80\x94his ample brow and quick grey\r\neyes seemed to look out, over his own plans, and the opposition of his\r\nenemies. His voice was stentorian: his hand stretched out in debate,\r\nseemed by its gigantic and muscular form, to warn his hearers that\r\nwords were not his only weapons. Few people had discovered some\r\ncowardice and much infirmity of purpose under this imposing exterior.\r\nNo man could crush a \xe2\x80\x9cbutterfly on the wheel\xe2\x80\x9d with better effect; no\r\nman better cover a speedy retreat from a powerful adversary. This had\r\nbeen the secret of his secession at the time of Lord Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nelection. In the unsteady glance of his eye, in his extreme desire to\r\nlearn the opinions of all, in the feebleness of his hand-writing, these\r\nqualities might be obscurely traced, but they were not generally known.\r\nHe was now our Lord Protector. He had canvassed eagerly for this post.\r\nHis protectorate was to be distinguished by every kind of innovation on\r\nthe aristocracy. This his selected task was exchanged for the far\r\ndifferent one of encountering the ruin caused by the convulsions of\r\nphysical nature. He was incapable of meeting these evils by any\r\ncomprehensive system; he had resorted to expedient after expedient, and\r\ncould never be induced to put a remedy in force, till it came too late\r\nto be of use.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Ryland that advanced towards us now, bore small\r\nresemblance to the powerful, ironical, seemingly fearless canvasser for\r\nthe first rank among Englishmen. Our native oak, as his partisans\r\ncalled him, was visited truly by a nipping winter. He scarcely appeared\r\nhalf his usual height; his joints were unknit, his limbs would not\r\nsupport him; his face was contracted, his eye wandering; debility of\r\npurpose and dastard fear were expressed in every gesture.\r\n\r\nIn answer to our eager questions, one word alone fell, as it were\r\ninvoluntarily, from his convulsed lips: _The Plague_.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEvery\r\nwhere\xe2\x80\x94we must fly\xe2\x80\x94all fly\xe2\x80\x94but whither? No man can tell\xe2\x80\x94there is no\r\nrefuge on earth, it comes on us like a thousand packs of wolves\xe2\x80\x94we must\r\nall fly\xe2\x80\x94where shall you go? Where can any of us go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were syllabled trembling by the iron man. Adrian replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither indeed would you fly? We must all remain; and do our best to\r\nhelp our suffering fellow-creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ryland, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no help!\xe2\x80\x94great God, who talks of help!\r\nAll the world has the plague!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen to avoid it, we must quit the world,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Adrian, with a\r\ngentle smile.\r\n\r\nRyland groaned; cold drops stood on his brow. It was useless to oppose\r\nhis paroxysm of terror: but we soothed and encouraged him, so that\r\nafter an interval he was better able to explain to us the ground of his\r\nalarm. It had come sufficiently home to him. One of his servants, while\r\nwaiting on him, had suddenly fallen down dead. The physician declared\r\nthat he died of the plague. We endeavoured to calm him\xe2\x80\x94but our own\r\nhearts were not calm. I saw the eye of Idris wander from me to her\r\nchildren, with an anxious appeal to my judgment. Adrian was absorbed in\r\nmeditation. For myself, I own that Ryland\xe2\x80\x99s words rang in my ears; all\r\nthe world was infected;\xe2\x80\x94in what uncontaminated seclusion could I save\r\nmy beloved treasures, until the shadow of death had passed from over\r\nthe earth? We sunk into silence: a silence that drank in the doleful\r\naccounts and prognostications of our guest. We had receded from the\r\ncrowd; and ascending the steps of the terrace, sought the Castle. Our\r\nchange of cheer struck those nearest to us; and, by means of Ryland\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservants, the report soon spread that he had fled from the plague in\r\nLondon. The sprightly parties broke up\xe2\x80\x94they assembled in whispering\r\ngroups. The spirit of gaiety was eclipsed; the music ceased; the young\r\npeople left their occupations and gathered together. The lightness of\r\nheart which had dressed them in masquerade habits, had decorated their\r\ntents, and assembled them in fantastic groups, appeared a sin against,\r\nand a provocative to, the awful destiny that had laid its palsying hand\r\nupon hope and life. The merriment of the hour was an unholy mockery of\r\nthe sorrows of man. The foreigners whom we had among us, who had fled\r\nfrom the plague in their own country, now saw their last asylum\r\ninvaded; and, fear making them garrulous, they described to eager\r\nlisteners the miseries they had beheld in cities visited by the\r\ncalamity, and gave fearful accounts of the insidious and irremediable\r\nnature of the disease.\r\n\r\nWe had entered the Castle. Idris stood at a window that over-looked the\r\npark; her maternal eyes sought her own children among the young crowd.\r\nAn Italian lad had got an audience about him, and with animated\r\ngestures was describing some scene of horror. Alfred stood immoveable\r\nbefore him, his whole attention absorbed. Little Evelyn had endeavoured\r\nto draw Clara away to play with him; but the Italian\xe2\x80\x99s tale arrested\r\nher, she crept near, her lustrous eyes fixed on the speaker. Either\r\nwatching the crowd in the park, or occupied by painful reflection, we\r\nwere all silent; Ryland stood by himself in an embrasure of the window;\r\nAdrian paced the hall, revolving some new and overpowering\r\nidea\xe2\x80\x94suddenly he stopped and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have long expected this; could we\r\nin reason expect that this island should be exempt from the universal\r\nvisitation? The evil is come home to us, and we must not shrink from\r\nour fate. What are your plans, my Lord Protector, for the benefit of\r\nour country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s love! Windsor,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ryland, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not mock me with that\r\ntitle. Death and disease level all men. I neither pretend to protect\r\nnor govern an hospital\xe2\x80\x94such will England quickly become.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you then intend, now in time of peril, to recede from your duties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuties! speak rationally, my Lord!\xe2\x80\x94when I am a plague-spotted corpse,\r\nwhere will my duties be? Every man for himself! the devil take the\r\nprotectorship, say I, if it expose me to danger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaint-hearted man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Adrian indignantly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYour countrymen put\r\ntheir trust in you, and you betray them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI betray them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ryland, \xe2\x80\x9cthe plague betrays me. Faint-hearted! It\r\nis well, shut up in your castle, out of danger, to boast yourself out\r\nof fear. Take the Protectorship who will; before God I renounce it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd before God,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his opponent, fervently, \xe2\x80\x9cdo I receive it! No\r\none will canvass for this honour now\xe2\x80\x94none envy my danger or labours.\r\nDeposit your powers in my hands. Long have I fought with death, and\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x9d (he stretched out his thin hand) \xe2\x80\x9cmuch have I suffered in the\r\nstruggle. It is not by flying, but by facing the enemy, that we can\r\nconquer. If my last combat is now about to be fought, and I am to be\r\nworsted\xe2\x80\x94so let it be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut come, Ryland, recollect yourself! Men have hitherto thought you\r\nmagnanimous and wise, will you cast aside these titles? Consider the\r\npanic your departure will occasion. Return to London. I will go with\r\nyou. Encourage the people by your presence. I will incur all the\r\ndanger. Shame! shame! if the first magistrate of England be foremost to\r\nrenounce his duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile among our guests in the park, all thoughts of festivity had\r\nfaded. As summer-flies are scattered by rain, so did this congregation,\r\nlate noisy and happy, in sadness and melancholy murmurs break up,\r\ndwindling away apace. With the set sun and the deepening twilight the\r\npark became nearly empty. Adrian and Ryland were still in earnest\r\ndiscussion. We had prepared a banquet for our guests in the lower hall\r\nof the castle; and thither Idris and I repaired to receive and\r\nentertain the few that remained. There is nothing more melancholy than\r\na merry-meeting thus turned to sorrow: the gala dresses\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndecorations, gay as they might otherwise be, receive a solemn and\r\nfunereal appearance. If such change be painful from lighter causes, it\r\nweighed with intolerable heaviness from the knowledge that the earth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesolator had at last, even as an arch-fiend, lightly over-leaped the\r\nboundaries our precautions raised, and at once enthroned himself in the\r\nfull and beating heart of our country. Idris sat at the top of the\r\nhalf-empty hall. Pale and tearful, she almost forgot her duties as\r\nhostess; her eyes were fixed on her children. Alfred\xe2\x80\x99s serious air\r\nshewed that he still revolved the tragic story related by the Italian\r\nboy. Evelyn was the only mirthful creature present: he sat on Clara\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlap; and, making matter of glee from his own fancies, laughed aloud.\r\nThe vaulted roof echoed again his infant tone. The poor mother who had\r\nbrooded long over, and suppressed the expression of her anguish, now\r\nburst into tears, and folding her babe in her arms, hurried from the\r\nhall. Clara and Alfred followed. While the rest of the company, in\r\nconfused murmur, which grew louder and louder, gave voice to their many\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nThe younger part gathered round me to ask my advice; and those who had\r\nfriends in London were anxious beyond the rest, to ascertain the\r\npresent extent of disease in the metropolis. I encouraged them with\r\nsuch thoughts of cheer as presented themselves. I told them exceedingly\r\nfew deaths had yet been occasioned by pestilence, and gave them hopes,\r\nas we were the last visited, so the calamity might have lost its most\r\nvenomous power before it had reached us. The cleanliness, habits of\r\norder, and the manner in which our cities were built, were all in our\r\nfavour. As it was an epidemic, its chief force was derived from\r\npernicious qualities in the air, and it would probably do little harm\r\nwhere this was naturally salubrious. At first, I had spoken only to\r\nthose nearest me; but the whole assembly gathered about me, and I found\r\nthat I was listened to by all. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cour risk is\r\ncommon; our precautions and exertions shall be common also. If manly\r\ncourage and resistance can save us, we will be saved. We will fight the\r\nenemy to the last. Plague shall not find us a ready prey; we will\r\ndispute every inch of ground; and, by methodical and inflexible laws,\r\npile invincible barriers to the progress of our foe. Perhaps in no part\r\nof the world has she met with so systematic and determined an\r\nopposition. Perhaps no country is naturally so well protected against\r\nour invader; nor has nature anywhere been so well assisted by the hand\r\nof man. We will not despair. We are neither cowards nor fatalists; but,\r\nbelieving that God has placed the means for our preservation in our own\r\nhands, we will use those means to our utmost. Remember that\r\ncleanliness, sobriety, and even good-humour and benevolence, are our\r\nbest medicines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was little I could add to this general exhortation; for the\r\nplague, though in London, was not among us. I dismissed the guests\r\ntherefore; and they went thoughtful, more than sad, to await the events\r\nin store for them.\r\n\r\nI now sought Adrian, anxious to hear the result of his discussion with\r\nRyland. He had in part prevailed; the Lord Protector consented to\r\nreturn to London for a few weeks; during which time things should be so\r\narranged, as to occasion less consternation at his departure. Adrian\r\nand Idris were together. The sadness with which the former had first\r\nheard that the plague was in London had vanished; the energy of his\r\npurpose informed his body with strength, the solemn joy of enthusiasm\r\nand self-devotion illuminated his countenance; and the weakness of his\r\nphysical nature seemed to pass from him, as the cloud of humanity did,\r\nin the ancient fable, from the divine lover of Semele. He was\r\nendeavouring to encourage his sister, and to bring her to look on his\r\nintent in a less tragic light than she was prepared to do; and with\r\npassionate eloquence he unfolded his designs to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me, at the first word,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9crelieve your mind from all fear\r\non my account. I will not task myself beyond my powers, nor will I\r\nneedlessly seek danger. I feel that I know what ought to be done, and\r\nas my presence is necessary for the accomplishment of my plans, I will\r\ntake especial care to preserve my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am now going to undertake an office fitted for me. I cannot\r\nintrigue, or work a tortuous path through the labyrinth of men\xe2\x80\x99s vices\r\nand passions; but I can bring patience, and sympathy, and such aid as\r\nart affords, to the bed of disease; I can raise from earth the\r\nmiserable orphan, and awaken to new hopes the shut heart of the\r\nmourner. I can enchain the plague in limits, and set a term to the\r\nmisery it would occasion; courage, forbearance, and watchfulness, are\r\nthe forces I bring towards this great work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I shall be something now! From my birth I have aspired like the\r\neagle \xe2\x80\x94but, unlike the eagle, my wings have failed, and my vision has\r\nbeen blinded. Disappointment and sickness have hitherto held dominion\r\nover me; twin born with me, my _would_, was for ever enchained by the\r\n_shall not_, of these my tyrants. A shepherd-boy that tends a silly\r\nflock on the mountains, was more in the scale of society than I.\r\nCongratulate me then that I have found fitting scope for my powers. I\r\nhave often thought of offering my services to the pestilence-stricken\r\ntowns of France and Italy; but fear of paining you, and expectation of\r\nthis catastrophe, withheld me. To England and to Englishmen I dedicate\r\nmyself. If I can save one of her mighty spirits from the deadly shaft;\r\nif I can ward disease from one of her smiling cottages, I shall not\r\nhave lived in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrange ambition this! Yet such was Adrian. He appeared given up to\r\ncontemplation, averse to excitement, a lowly student, a man of visions\xe2\x80\x94\r\nbut afford him worthy theme, and\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLike to the lark at break of day arising,\r\nFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven\xe2\x80\x99s gate.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nso did he spring up from listlessness and unproductive thought, to the\r\nhighest pitch of virtuous action.\r\n\r\nWith him went enthusiasm, the high-wrought resolve, the eye that\r\nwithout blenching could look at death. With us remained sorrow,\r\nanxiety, and unendurable expectation of evil. The man, says Lord Bacon,\r\nwho hath wife and children, has given hostages to fortune. Vain was all\r\nphilosophical reasoning\xe2\x80\x94vain all fortitude\xe2\x80\x94vain, vain, a reliance on\r\nprobable good. I might heap high the scale with logic, courage, and\r\nresignation\xe2\x80\x94but let one fear for Idris and our children enter the\r\nopposite one, and, over-weighed, it kicked the beam.\r\n\r\nThe plague was in London! Fools that we were not long ago to have\r\nforeseen this. We wept over the ruin of the boundless continents of the\r\neast, and the desolation of the western world; while we fancied that\r\nthe little channel between our island and the rest of the earth was to\r\npreserve us alive among the dead. It were no mighty leap methinks from\r\nCalais to Dover. The eye easily discerns the sister land; they were\r\nunited once; and the little path that runs between looks in a map but\r\nas a trodden footway through high grass. Yet this small interval was to\r\nsave us: the sea was to rise a wall of adamant\xe2\x80\x94without, disease and\r\nmisery\xe2\x80\x94within, a shelter from evil, a nook of the garden of paradise\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nparticle of celestial soil, which no evil could invade\xe2\x80\x94truly we were\r\nwise in our generation, to imagine all these things!\r\n\r\nBut we are awake now. The plague is in London; the air of England is\r\ntainted, and her sons and daughters strew the unwholesome earth. And\r\nnow, the sea, late our defence, seems our prison bound; hemmed in by\r\nits gulphs, we shall die like the famished inhabitants of a besieged\r\ntown. Other nations have a fellowship in death; but we, shut out from\r\nall neighbourhood, must bury our own dead, and little England become a\r\nwide, wide tomb.\r\n\r\nThis feeling of universal misery assumed concentration and shape, when\r\nI looked on my wife and children; and the thought of danger to them\r\npossessed my whole being with fear. How could I save them? I revolved a\r\nthousand and a thousand plans. They should not die\xe2\x80\x94first I would be\r\ngathered to nothingness, ere infection should come anear these idols of\r\nmy soul. I would walk barefoot through the world, to find an uninfected\r\nspot; I would build my home on some wave-tossed plank, drifted about on\r\nthe barren, shoreless ocean. I would betake me with them to some wild\r\nbeast\xe2\x80\x99s den, where a tyger\xe2\x80\x99s cubs, which I would slay, had been reared\r\nin health. I would seek the mountain eagle\xe2\x80\x99s eirie, and live years\r\nsuspended in some inaccessible recess of a sea-bounding cliff\xe2\x80\x94no labour\r\ntoo great, no scheme too wild, if it promised life to them. O! ye\r\nheart-strings of mine, could ye be torn asunder, and my soul not spend\r\nitself in tears of blood for sorrow!\r\n\r\nIdris, after the first shock, regained a portion of fortitude. She\r\nstudiously shut out all prospect of the future, and cradled her heart\r\nin present blessings. She never for a moment lost sight of her\r\nchildren. But while they in health sported about her, she could cherish\r\ncontentment and hope. A strange and wild restlessness came over me\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmore intolerable, because I was forced to conceal it. My fears for\r\nAdrian were ceaseless; August had come; and the symptoms of plague\r\nencreased rapidly in London. It was deserted by all who possessed the\r\npower of removing; and he, the brother of my soul, was exposed to the\r\nperils from which all but slaves enchained by circumstance fled. He\r\nremained to combat the fiend\xe2\x80\x94his side unguarded, his toils\r\nunshared\xe2\x80\x94infection might even reach him, and he die unattended and\r\nalone. By day and night these thoughts pursued me. I resolved to visit\r\nLondon, to see him; to quiet these agonizing throes by the sweet\r\nmedicine of hope, or the opiate of despair.\r\n\r\nIt was not until I arrived at Brentford, that I perceived much change\r\nin the face of the country. The better sort of houses were shut up; the\r\nbusy trade of the town palsied; there was an air of anxiety among the\r\nfew passengers I met, and they looked wonderingly at my carriage\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfirst they had seen pass towards London, since pestilence sat on its\r\nhigh places, and possessed its busy streets. I met several funerals;\r\nthey were slenderly attended by mourners, and were regarded by the\r\nspectators as omens of direst import. Some gazed on these processions\r\nwith wild eagerness\xe2\x80\x94 others fled timidly\xe2\x80\x94some wept aloud.\r\n\r\nAdrian\xe2\x80\x99s chief endeavour, after the immediate succour of the sick, had\r\nbeen to disguise the symptoms and progress of the plague from the\r\ninhabitants of London. He knew that fear and melancholy forebodings\r\nwere powerful assistants to disease; that desponding and brooding care\r\nrendered the physical nature of man peculiarly susceptible of\r\ninfection. No unseemly sights were therefore discernible: the shops\r\nwere in general open, the concourse of passengers in some degree kept\r\nup. But although the appearance of an infected town was avoided, to me,\r\nwho had not beheld it since the commencement of the visitation, London\r\nappeared sufficiently changed. There were no carriages, and grass had\r\nsprung high in the streets; the houses had a desolate look; most of the\r\nshutters were closed; and there was a ghast and frightened stare in the\r\npersons I met, very different from the usual business-like demeanour of\r\nthe Londoners. My solitary carriage attracted notice, as it rattled\r\nalong towards the Protectoral Palace\xe2\x80\x94and the fashionable streets\r\nleading to it wore a still more dreary and deserted appearance. I found\r\nAdrian\xe2\x80\x99s anti-chamber crowded\xe2\x80\x94it was his hour for giving audience. I\r\nwas unwilling to disturb his labours, and waited, watching the ingress\r\nand egress of the petitioners. They consisted of people of the middling\r\nand lower classes of society, whose means of subsistence failed with\r\nthe cessation of trade, and of the busy spirit of money-making in all\r\nits branches, peculiar to our country. There was an air of anxiety,\r\nsometimes of terror in the new-comers, strongly contrasted with the\r\nresigned and even satisfied mien of those who had had audience. I could\r\nread the influence of my friend in their quickened motions and cheerful\r\nfaces. Two o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck, after which none were admitted; those who\r\nhad been disappointed went sullenly or sorrowfully away, while I\r\nentered the audience-chamber.\r\n\r\nI was struck by the improvement that appeared in the health of Adrian.\r\nHe was no longer bent to the ground, like an over-nursed flower of\r\nspring, that, shooting up beyond its strength, is weighed down even by\r\nits own coronal of blossoms. His eyes were bright, his countenance\r\ncomposed, an air of concentrated energy was diffused over his whole\r\nperson, much unlike its former languor. He sat at a table with several\r\nsecretaries, who were arranging petitions, or registering the notes\r\nmade during that day\xe2\x80\x99s audience. Two or three petitioners were still in\r\nattendance. I admired his justice and patience. Those who possessed a\r\npower of living out of London, he advised immediately to quit it,\r\naffording them the means of so doing. Others, whose trade was\r\nbeneficial to the city, or who possessed no other refuge, he provided\r\nwith advice for better avoiding the epidemic; relieving overloaded\r\nfamilies, supplying the gaps made in others by death. Order, comfort,\r\nand even health, rose under his influence, as from the touch of a\r\nmagician\xe2\x80\x99s wand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you are come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me, when we were at last alone; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan only spare a few minutes, and must tell you much in that time. The\r\nplague is now in progress\xe2\x80\x94it is useless closing one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to the\r\nfact\xe2\x80\x94the deaths encrease each week. What will come I cannot guess. As\r\nyet, thank God, I am equal to the government of the town; and I look\r\nonly to the present. Ryland, whom I have so long detained, has\r\nstipulated that I shall suffer him to depart before the end of this\r\nmonth. The deputy appointed by parliament is dead; another therefore\r\nmust be named; I have advanced my claim, and I believe that I shall\r\nhave no competitor. To-night the question is to be decided, as there is\r\na call of the house for the purpose. You must nominate me, Lionel;\r\nRyland, for shame, cannot shew himself; but you, my friend, will do me\r\nthis service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow lovely is devotion! Here was a youth, royally sprung, bred in\r\nluxury, by nature averse to the usual struggles of a public life, and\r\nnow, in time of danger, at a period when to live was the utmost scope\r\nof the ambitious, he, the beloved and heroic Adrian, made, in sweet\r\nsimplicity, an offer to sacrifice himself for the public good. The very\r\nidea was generous and noble,\xe2\x80\x94but, beyond this, his unpretending manner,\r\nhis entire want of the assumption of a virtue, rendered his act ten\r\ntimes more touching. I would have withstood his request; but I had seen\r\nthe good he diffused; I felt that his resolves were not to be shaken,\r\nso, with an heavy heart, I consented to do as he asked. He grasped my\r\nhand affectionately:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have relieved me from a\r\npainful dilemma, and are, as you ever were, the best of my friends.\r\nFarewell\xe2\x80\x94I must now leave you for a few hours. Go you and converse with\r\nRyland. Although he deserts his post in London, he may be of the\r\ngreatest service in the north of England, by receiving and assisting\r\ntravellers, and contributing to supply the metropolis with food. Awaken\r\nhim, I entreat you, to some sense of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdrian left me, as I afterwards learnt, upon his daily task of visiting\r\nthe hospitals, and inspecting the crowded parts of London. I found\r\nRyland much altered, even from what he had been when he visited\r\nWindsor. Perpetual fear had jaundiced his complexion, and shrivelled\r\nhis whole person. I told him of the business of the evening, and a\r\nsmile relaxed the contracted muscles. He desired to go; each day he\r\nexpected to be infected by pestilence, each day he was unable to resist\r\nthe gentle violence of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s detention. The moment Adrian should be\r\nlegally elected his deputy, he would escape to safety. Under this\r\nimpression he listened to all I said; and, elevated almost to joy by\r\nthe near prospect of his departure, he entered into a discussion\r\nconcerning the plans he should adopt in his own county, forgetting, for\r\nthe moment, his cherished resolution of shutting himself up from all\r\ncommunication in the mansion and grounds of his estate.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Adrian and I proceeded to Westminster. As we went he\r\nreminded me of what I was to say and do, yet, strange to say, I entered\r\nthe chamber without having once reflected on my purpose. Adrian\r\nremained in the coffee-room, while I, in compliance with his desire,\r\ntook my seat in St. Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s. There reigned unusual silence in the\r\nchamber. I had not visited it since Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s protectorate; a period\r\nconspicuous for a numerous attendance of members, for the eloquence of\r\nthe speakers, and the warmth of the debate. The benches were very\r\nempty, those by custom occupied by the hereditary members were vacant;\r\nthe city members were there\xe2\x80\x94the members for the commercial towns, few\r\nlanded proprietors, and not many of those who entered parliament for\r\nthe sake of a career. The first subject that occupied the attention of\r\nthe house was an address from the Lord Protector, praying them to\r\nappoint a deputy during a necessary absence on his part.\r\n\r\nA silence prevailed, till one of the members coming to me, whispered\r\nthat the Earl of Windsor had sent him word that I was to move his\r\nelection, in the absence of the person who had been first chosen for\r\nthis office. Now for the first time I saw the full extent of my task,\r\nand I was overwhelmed by what I had brought on myself. Ryland had\r\ndeserted his post through fear of the plague: from the same fear Adrian\r\nhad no competitor. And I, the nearest kinsman of the Earl of Windsor,\r\nwas to propose his election. I was to thrust this selected and\r\nmatchless friend into the post of danger\xe2\x80\x94 impossible! the die was\r\ncast\xe2\x80\x94I would offer myself as candidate.\r\n\r\nThe few members who were present, had come more for the sake of\r\nterminating the business by securing a legal attendance, than under the\r\nidea of a debate. I had risen mechanically\xe2\x80\x94my knees trembled;\r\nirresolution hung on my voice, as I uttered a few words on the\r\nnecessity of choosing a person adequate to the dangerous task in hand.\r\nBut, when the idea of presenting myself in the room of my friend\r\nintruded, the load of doubt and pain was taken from off me. My words\r\nflowed spontaneously\xe2\x80\x94my utterance was firm and quick. I adverted to\r\nwhat Adrian had already done\xe2\x80\x94I promised the same vigilance in\r\nfurthering all his views. I drew a touching picture of his vacillating\r\nhealth; I boasted of my own strength. I prayed them to save even from\r\nhimself this scion of the noblest family in England. My alliance with\r\nhim was the pledge of my sincerity, my union with his sister, my\r\nchildren, his presumptive heirs, were the hostages of my truth.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected turn in the debate was quickly communicated to Adrian.\r\nHe hurried in, and witnessed the termination of my impassioned\r\nharangue. I did not see him: my soul was in my words,\xe2\x80\x94my eyes could not\r\nperceive that which was; while a vision of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s form, tainted by\r\npestilence, and sinking in death, floated before them. He seized my\r\nhand, as I concluded\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cUnkind!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have betrayed me!\xe2\x80\x9d then,\r\nspringing forwards, with the air of one who had a right to command, he\r\nclaimed the place of deputy as his own. He had bought it, he said, with\r\ndanger, and paid for it with toil. His ambition rested there; and,\r\nafter an interval devoted to the interests of his country, was I to\r\nstep in, and reap the profit? Let them remember what London had been\r\nwhen he arrived: the panic that prevailed brought famine, while every\r\nmoral and legal tie was loosened. He had restored order\xe2\x80\x94this had been a\r\nwork which required perseverance, patience, and energy; and he had\r\nneither slept nor waked but for the good of his country.\xe2\x80\x94Would they\r\ndare wrong him thus? Would they wrest his hard-earned reward from him,\r\nto bestow it on one, who, never having mingled in public life, would\r\ncome a tyro to the craft, in which he was an adept. He demanded the\r\nplace of deputy as his right. Ryland had shewn that he preferred him.\r\nNever before had he, who was born even to the inheritance of the throne\r\nof England, never had he asked favour or honour from those now his\r\nequals, but who might have been his subjects. Would they refuse him?\r\nCould they thrust back from the path of distinction and laudable\r\nambition, the heir of their ancient kings, and heap another\r\ndisappointment on a fallen house.\r\n\r\nNo one had ever before heard Adrian allude to the rights of his\r\nancestors. None had ever before suspected, that power, or the suffrage\r\nof the many, could in any manner become dear to him. He had begun his\r\nspeech with vehemence; he ended with unassuming gentleness, making his\r\nappeal with the same humility, as if he had asked to be the first in\r\nwealth, honour, and power among Englishmen, and not, as was the truth,\r\nto be the foremost in the ranks of loathsome toils and inevitable\r\ndeath. A murmur of approbation rose after his speech. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, do not\r\nlisten to him,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9che speaks false\xe2\x80\x94false to himself,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\ninterrupted: and, silence being restored, we were ordered, as was the\r\ncustom, to retire during the decision of the house. I fancied that they\r\nhesitated, and that there was some hope for me\xe2\x80\x94I was mistaken\xe2\x80\x94hardly\r\nhad we quitted the chamber, before Adrian was recalled, and installed\r\nin his office of Lord Deputy to the Protector.\r\n\r\nWe returned together to the palace. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Lionel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ndid you intend? you could not hope to conquer, and yet you gave me the\r\npain of a triumph over my dearest friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is mockery,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cyou devote yourself,\xe2\x80\x94you, the adored\r\nbrother of Idris, the being, of all the world contains, dearest to our\r\nhearts\xe2\x80\x94you devote yourself to an early death. I would have prevented\r\nthis; my death would be a small evil\xe2\x80\x94or rather I should not die; while\r\nyou cannot hope to escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the likelihood of escaping,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9cten years hence the\r\ncold stars may shine on the graves of all of us; but as to my peculiar\r\nliability to infection, I could easily prove, both logically and\r\nphysically, that in the midst of contagion I have a better chance of\r\nlife than you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my post: I was born for this\xe2\x80\x94to rule England in anarchy, to\r\nsave her in danger\xe2\x80\x94to devote myself for her. The blood of my\r\nforefathers cries aloud in my veins, and bids me be first among my\r\ncountrymen. Or, if this mode of speech offend you, let me say, that my\r\nmother, the proud queen, instilled early into me a love of distinction,\r\nand all that, if the weakness of my physical nature and my peculiar\r\nopinions had not prevented such a design, might have made me long since\r\nstruggle for the lost inheritance of my race. But now my mother, or, if\r\nyou will, my mother\xe2\x80\x99s lessons, awaken within me. I cannot lead on to\r\nbattle; I cannot, through intrigue and faithlessness rear again the\r\nthrone upon the wreck of English public spirit. But I can be the first\r\nto support and guard my country, now that terrific disasters and ruin\r\nhave laid strong hands upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat country and my beloved sister are all I have. I will protect the\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94the latter I commit to your charge. If I survive, and she be\r\nlost, I were far better dead. Preserve her\xe2\x80\x94for her own sake I know that\r\nyou will\xe2\x80\x94if you require any other spur, think that, in preserving her,\r\nyou preserve me. Her faultless nature, one sum of perfections, is wrapt\r\nup in her affections\xe2\x80\x94if they were hurt, she would droop like an\r\nunwatered floweret, and the slightest injury they receive is a nipping\r\nfrost to her. Already she fears for us. She fears for the children she\r\nadores, and for you, the father of these, her lover, husband,\r\nprotector; and you must be near her to support and encourage her.\r\nReturn to Windsor then, my brother; for such you are by every tie\xe2\x80\x94fill\r\nthe double place my absence imposes on you, and let me, in all my\r\nsufferings here, turn my eyes towards that dear seclusion, and\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94There is peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n [7] Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Sonnets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did proceed to Windsor, but not with the intention of remaining\r\nthere. I went but to obtain the consent of Idris, and then to return\r\nand take my station beside my unequalled friend; to share his labours,\r\nand save him, if so it must be, at the expence of my life. Yet I\r\ndreaded to witness the anguish which my resolve might excite in Idris.\r\nI had vowed to my own heart never to shadow her countenance even with\r\ntransient grief, and should I prove recreant at the hour of greatest\r\nneed? I had begun my journey with anxious haste; now I desired to draw\r\nit out through the course of days and months. I longed to avoid the\r\nnecessity of action; I strove to escape from thought\xe2\x80\x94vainly\xe2\x80\x94futurity,\r\nlike a dark image in a phantasmagoria, came nearer and more near, till\r\nit clasped the whole earth in its shadow.\r\n\r\nA slight circumstance induced me to alter my usual route, and to return\r\nhome by Egham and Bishopgate. I alighted at Perdita\xe2\x80\x99s ancient abode,\r\nher cottage; and, sending forward the carriage, determined to walk\r\nacross the park to the castle. This spot, dedicated to sweetest\r\nrecollections, the deserted house and neglected garden were well\r\nadapted to nurse my melancholy. In our happiest days, Perdita had\r\nadorned her cottage with every aid art might bring, to that which\r\nnature had selected to favour. In the same spirit of exaggeration she\r\nhad, on the event of her separation from Raymond, caused it to be\r\nentirely neglected. It was now in ruin: the deer had climbed the broken\r\npalings, and reposed among the flowers; grass grew on the threshold,\r\nand the swinging lattice creaking to the wind, gave signal of utter\r\ndesertion. The sky was blue above, and the air impregnated with\r\nfragrance by the rare flowers that grew among the weeds. The trees\r\nmoved overhead, awakening nature\xe2\x80\x99s favourite melody\xe2\x80\x94but the melancholy\r\nappearance of the choaked paths, and weed-grown flower-beds, dimmed\r\neven this gay summer scene. The time when in proud and happy security\r\nwe assembled at this cottage, was gone\xe2\x80\x94soon the present hours would\r\njoin those past, and shadows of future ones rose dark and menacing from\r\nthe womb of time, their cradle and their bier. For the first time in my\r\nlife I envied the sleep of the dead, and thought with pleasure of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed under the sod, where grief and fear have no power. I passed through\r\nthe gap of the broken paling\xe2\x80\x94I felt, while I disdained, the choaking\r\ntears\xe2\x80\x94I rushed into the depths of the forest. O death and change,\r\nrulers of our life, where are ye, that I may grapple with you! What was\r\nthere in our tranquillity, that excited your envy\xe2\x80\x94in our happiness,\r\nthat ye should destroy it? We were happy, loving, and beloved; the horn\r\nof Amalthea contained no blessing unshowered upon us, but, alas!\r\n\r\n        la fortuna\r\ndeidad barbara importuna,\r\noy cadaver y ayer flor,\r\nno permanece jamas![8]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I wandered on thus ruminating, a number of country people passed me.\r\nThey seemed full of careful thought, and a few words of their\r\nconversation that reached me, induced me to approach and make further\r\nenquiries. A party of people flying from London, as was frequent in\r\nthose days, had come up the Thames in a boat. No one at Windsor would\r\nafford them shelter; so, going a little further up, they remained all\r\nnight in a deserted hut near Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s lock. They pursued their way the\r\nfollowing morning, leaving one of their company behind them, sick of\r\nthe plague. This circumstance once spread abroad, none dared approach\r\nwithin half a mile of the infected neighbourhood, and the deserted\r\nwretch was left to fight with disease and death in solitude, as he best\r\nmight. I was urged by compassion to hasten to the hut, for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining his situation, and administering to his wants.\r\n\r\nAs I advanced I met knots of country-people talking earnestly of this\r\nevent: distant as they were from the apprehended contagion, fear was\r\nimpressed on every countenance. I passed by a group of these\r\nterrorists, in a lane in the direct road to the hut. One of them\r\nstopped me, and, conjecturing that I was ignorant of the circumstance,\r\ntold me not to go on, for that an infected person lay but at a short\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am going to see in what condition the\r\npoor fellow is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA murmur of surprise and horror ran through the assembly. I\r\ncontinued:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThis poor wretch is deserted, dying, succourless; in these\r\nunhappy times, God knows how soon any or all of us may be in like want.\r\nI am going to do, as I would be done by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will never be able to return to the Castle\xe2\x80\x94Lady Idris\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d in confused speech were the words that struck my ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not know, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Earl himself, now Lord\r\nProtector, visits daily, not only those probably infected by this\r\ndisease, but the hospitals and pest houses, going near, and even\r\ntouching the sick? yet he was never in better health. You labour under\r\nan entire mistake as to the nature of the plague; but do not fear, I do\r\nnot ask any of you to accompany me, nor to believe me, until I return\r\nsafe and sound from my patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I left them, and hurried on. I soon arrived at the hut: the door was\r\najar. I entered, and one glance assured me that its former inhabitant\r\nwas no more\xe2\x80\x94he lay on a heap of straw, cold and stiff; while a\r\npernicious effluvia filled the room, and various stains and marks\r\nserved to shew the virulence of the disorder.\r\n\r\nI had never before beheld one killed by pestilence. While every mind\r\nwas full of dismay at its effects, a craving for excitement had led us\r\nto peruse De Foe\xe2\x80\x99s account, and the masterly delineations of the author\r\nof Arthur Mervyn. The pictures drawn in these books were so vivid, that\r\nwe seemed to have experienced the results depicted by them. But cold\r\nwere the sensations excited by words, burning though they were, and\r\ndescribing the death and misery of thousands, compared to what I felt\r\nin looking on the corpse of this unhappy stranger. This indeed was the\r\nplague. I raised his rigid limbs, I marked the distortion of his face,\r\nand the stony eyes lost to perception. As I was thus occupied, chill\r\nhorror congealed my blood, making my flesh quiver and my hair to stand\r\non end. Half insanely I spoke to the dead. So the plague killed you, I\r\nmuttered. How came this? Was the coming painful? You look as if the\r\nenemy had tortured, before he murdered you. And now I leapt up\r\nprecipitately, and escaped from the hut, before nature could revoke her\r\nlaws, and inorganic words be breathed in answer from the lips of the\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nOn returning through the lane, I saw at a distance the same assemblage\r\nof persons which I had left. They hurried away, as soon as they saw me;\r\nmy agitated mien added to their fear of coming near one who had entered\r\nwithin the verge of contagion.\r\n\r\nAt a distance from facts one draws conclusions which appear infallible,\r\nwhich yet when put to the test of reality, vanish like unreal dreams. I\r\nhad ridiculed the fears of my countrymen, when they related to others;\r\nnow that they came home to myself, I paused. The Rubicon, I felt, was\r\npassed; and it behoved me well to reflect what I should do on this\r\nhither side of disease and danger. According to the vulgar\r\nsuperstition, my dress, my person, the air I breathed, bore in it\r\nmortal danger to myself and others. Should I return to the Castle, to\r\nmy wife and children, with this taint upon me? Not surely if I were\r\ninfected; but I felt certain that I was not\xe2\x80\x94a few hours would determine\r\nthe question\xe2\x80\x94I would spend these in the forest, in reflection on what\r\nwas to come, and what my future actions were to be. In the feeling\r\ncommunicated to me by the sight of one struck by the plague, I forgot\r\nthe events that had excited me so strongly in London; new and more\r\npainful prospects, by degrees were cleared of the mist which had\r\nhitherto veiled them. The question was no longer whether I should share\r\nAdrian\xe2\x80\x99s toils and danger; but in what manner I could, in Windsor and\r\nthe neighbourhood, imitate the prudence and zeal which, under his\r\ngovernment, produced order and plenty in London, and how, now\r\npestilence had spread more widely, I could secure the health of my own\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nI spread the whole earth out as a map before me. On no one spot of its\r\nsurface could I put my finger and say, here is safety. In the south,\r\nthe disease, virulent and immedicable, had nearly annihilated the race\r\nof man; storm and inundation, poisonous winds and blights, filled up\r\nthe measure of suffering. In the north it was worse\xe2\x80\x94the lesser\r\npopulation gradually declined, and famine and plague kept watch on the\r\nsurvivors, who, helpless and feeble, were ready to fall an easy prey\r\ninto their hands.\r\n\r\nI contracted my view to England. The overgrown metropolis, the great\r\nheart of mighty Britain, was pulseless. Commerce had ceased. All resort\r\nfor ambition or pleasure was cut off\xe2\x80\x94the streets were grass-grown\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nhouses empty\xe2\x80\x94the few, that from necessity remained, seemed already\r\nbranded with the taint of inevitable pestilence. In the larger\r\nmanufacturing towns the same tragedy was acted on a smaller, yet more\r\ndisastrous scale. There was no Adrian to superintend and direct, while\r\nwhole flocks of the poor were struck and killed. Yet we were not all to\r\ndie. No truly, though thinned, the race of man would continue, and the\r\ngreat plague would, in after years, become matter of history and\r\nwonder. Doubtless this visitation was for extent unexampled\xe2\x80\x94more need\r\nthat we should work hard to dispute its progress; ere this men have\r\ngone out in sport, and slain their thousands and tens of thousands; but\r\nnow man had become a creature of price; the life of one of them was of\r\nmore worth than the so called treasures of kings. Look at his\r\nthought-endued countenance, his graceful limbs, his majestic brow, his\r\nwondrous mechanism\xe2\x80\x94the type and model of this best work of God is not\r\nto be cast aside as a broken vessel\xe2\x80\x94he shall be preserved, and his\r\nchildren and his children\xe2\x80\x99s children carry down the name and form of\r\nman to latest time.\r\n\r\nAbove all I must guard those entrusted by nature and fate to my\r\nespecial care. And surely, if among all my fellow-creatures I were to\r\nselect those who might stand forth examples of the greatness and\r\ngoodness of man, I could choose no other than those allied to me by the\r\nmost sacred ties. Some from among the family of man must survive, and\r\nthese should be among the survivors; that should be my task\xe2\x80\x94to\r\naccomplish it my own life were a small sacrifice. There then in that\r\ncastle\xe2\x80\x94in Windsor Castle, birth-place of Idris and my babes, should be\r\nthe haven and retreat for the wrecked bark of human society. Its forest\r\nshould be our world\xe2\x80\x94its garden afford us food; within its walls I would\r\nestablish the shaken throne of health. I was an outcast and a vagabond,\r\nwhen Adrian gently threw over me the silver net of love and\r\ncivilization, and linked me inextricably to human charities and human\r\nexcellence. I was one, who, though an aspirant after good, and an\r\nardent lover of wisdom, was yet unenrolled in any list of worth, when\r\nIdris, the princely born, who was herself the personification of all\r\nthat was divine in woman, she who walked the earth like a poet\xe2\x80\x99s dream,\r\nas a carved goddess endued with sense, or pictured saint stepping from\r\nthe canvas\xe2\x80\x94she, the most worthy, chose me, and gave me herself\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npriceless gift.\r\n\r\nDuring several hours I continued thus to meditate, till hunger and\r\nfatigue brought me back to the passing hour, then marked by long\r\nshadows cast from the descending sun. I had wandered towards Bracknel,\r\nfar to the west of Windsor. The feeling of perfect health which I\r\nenjoyed, assured me that I was free from contagion. I remembered that\r\nIdris had been kept in ignorance of my proceedings. She might have\r\nheard of my return from London, and my visit to Bolter\xe2\x80\x99s Lock, which,\r\nconnected with my continued absence, might tend greatly to alarm her. I\r\nreturned to Windsor by the Long Walk, and passing through the town\r\ntowards the Castle, I found it in a state of agitation and disturbance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late to be ambitious,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sir Thomas Browne. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot\r\nhope to live so long in our names as some have done in their persons;\r\none face of Janus holds no proportion to the other.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon this text\r\nmany fanatics arose, who prophesied that the end of time was come. The\r\nspirit of superstition had birth, from the wreck of our hopes, and\r\nantics wild and dangerous were played on the great theatre, while the\r\nremaining particle of futurity dwindled into a point in the eyes of the\r\nprognosticators. Weak-spirited women died of fear as they listened to\r\ntheir denunciations; men of robust form and seeming strength fell into\r\nidiotcy and madness, racked by the dread of coming eternity. A man of\r\nthis kind was now pouring forth his eloquent despair among the\r\ninhabitants of Windsor. The scene of the morning, and my visit to the\r\ndead, which had been spread abroad, had alarmed the country-people, so\r\nthey had become fit instruments to be played upon by a maniac.\r\n\r\nThe poor wretch had lost his young wife and lovely infant by the\r\nplague. He was a mechanic; and, rendered unable to attend to the\r\noccupation which supplied his necessities, famine was added to his\r\nother miseries. He left the chamber which contained his wife and\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x94wife and child no more, but \xe2\x80\x9cdead earth upon the earth\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94wild with\r\nhunger, watching and grief, his diseased fancy made him believe himself\r\nsent by heaven to preach the end of time to the world. He entered the\r\nchurches, and foretold to the congregations their speedy removal to the\r\nvaults below. He appeared like the forgotten spirit of the time in the\r\ntheatres, and bade the spectators go home and die. He had been seized\r\nand confined; he had escaped and wandered from London among the\r\nneighbouring towns, and, with frantic gestures and thrilling words, he\r\nunveiled to each their hidden fears, and gave voice to the soundless\r\nthought they dared not syllable. He stood under the arcade of the\r\ntown-hall of Windsor, and from this elevation harangued a trembling\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, O ye inhabitants of the earth,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9chear thou, all\r\nseeing, but most pitiless Heaven! hear thou too, O tempest-tossed\r\nheart, which breathes out these words, yet faints beneath their\r\nmeaning! Death is among us! The earth is beautiful and flower-bedecked,\r\nbut she is our grave! The clouds of heaven weep for us\xe2\x80\x94the pageantry of\r\nthe stars is but our funeral torchlight. Grey headed men, ye hoped for\r\nyet a few years in your long-known abode\xe2\x80\x94but the lease is up, you must\r\nremove\xe2\x80\x94children, ye will never reach maturity, even now the small grave\r\nis dug for ye\xe2\x80\x94 mothers, clasp them in your arms, one death embraces\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShuddering, he stretched out his hands, his eyes cast up, seemed\r\nbursting from their sockets, while he appeared to follow shapes, to us\r\ninvisible, in the yielding air\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe dead!\r\nThey rise in their shrouds, and pass in silent procession towards the\r\nfar land of their doom\xe2\x80\x94their bloodless lips move not\xe2\x80\x94their shadowy\r\nlimbs are void of motion, while still they glide onwards. We come,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, springing forwards, \xe2\x80\x9cfor what should we wait? Haste, my\r\nfriends, apparel yourselves in the court-dress of death. Pestilence\r\nwill usher you to his presence. Why thus long? they, the good, the\r\nwise, and the beloved, are gone before. Mothers, kiss you\r\nlast\xe2\x80\x94husbands, protectors no more, lead on the partners of your death!\r\nCome, O come! while the dear ones are yet in sight, for soon they will\r\npass away, and we never never shall join them more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom such ravings as these, he would suddenly become collected, and\r\nwith unexaggerated but terrific words, paint the horrors of the time;\r\ndescribe with minute detail, the effects of the plague on the human\r\nframe, and tell heart-breaking tales of the snapping of dear\r\naffinities\xe2\x80\x94the gasping horror of despair over the death-bed of the last\r\nbeloved\xe2\x80\x94so that groans and even shrieks burst from the crowd. One man\r\nin particular stood in front, his eyes fixt on the prophet, his mouth\r\nopen, his limbs rigid, while his face changed to various colours,\r\nyellow, blue, and green, through intense fear. The maniac caught his\r\nglance, and turned his eye on him\xe2\x80\x94 one has heard of the gaze of the\r\nrattle-snake, which allures the trembling victim till he falls within\r\nhis jaws. The maniac became composed; his person rose higher; authority\r\nbeamed from his countenance. He looked on the peasant, who began to\r\ntremble, while he still gazed; his knees knocked together; his teeth\r\nchattered. He at last fell down in convulsions. \xe2\x80\x9cThat man has the\r\nplague,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maniac calmly. A shriek burst from the lips of the\r\npoor wretch; and then sudden motionlessness came over him; it was\r\nmanifest to all that he was dead.\r\n\r\nCries of horror filled the place\xe2\x80\x94every one endeavoured to effect his\r\nescape\xe2\x80\x94in a few minutes the market place was cleared\xe2\x80\x94the corpse lay on\r\nthe ground; and the maniac, subdued and exhausted, sat beside it,\r\nleaning his gaunt cheek upon his thin hand. Soon some people, deputed\r\nby the magistrates, came to remove the body; the unfortunate being saw\r\na jailor in each\xe2\x80\x94he fled precipitately, while I passed onwards to the\r\nCastle.\r\n\r\nDeath, cruel and relentless, had entered these beloved walls. An old\r\nservant, who had nursed Idris in infancy, and who lived with us more on\r\nthe footing of a revered relative than a domestic, had gone a few days\r\nbefore to visit a daughter, married, and settled in the neighbourhood\r\nof London. On the night of her return she sickened of the plague. From\r\nthe haughty and unbending nature of the Countess of Windsor, Idris had\r\nfew tender filial associations with her. This good woman had stood in\r\nthe place of a mother, and her very deficiencies of education and\r\nknowledge, by rendering her humble and defenceless, endeared her to\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94she was the especial favourite of the children. I found my poor\r\ngirl, there is no exaggeration in the expression, wild with grief and\r\ndread. She hung over the patient in agony, which was not mitigated when\r\nher thoughts wandered towards her babes, for whom she feared infection.\r\nMy arrival was like the newly discovered lamp of a lighthouse to\r\nsailors, who are weathering some dangerous point. She deposited her\r\nappalling doubts in my hands; she relied on my judgment, and was\r\ncomforted by my participation in her sorrow. Soon our poor nurse\r\nexpired; and the anguish of suspense was changed to deep regret, which\r\nthough at first more painful, yet yielded with greater readiness to my\r\nconsolations. Sleep, the sovereign balm, at length steeped her tearful\r\neyes in forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nShe slept; and quiet prevailed in the Castle, whose inhabitants were\r\nhushed to repose. I was awake, and during the long hours of dead night,\r\nmy busy thoughts worked in my brain, like ten thousand mill-wheels,\r\nrapid, acute, untameable. All slept\xe2\x80\x94all England slept; and from my\r\nwindow, commanding a wide prospect of the star-illumined country, I saw\r\nthe land stretched out in placid rest. I was awake, alive, while the\r\nbrother of death possessed my race. What, if the more potent of these\r\nfraternal deities should obtain dominion over it? The silence of\r\nmidnight, to speak truly, though apparently a paradox, rung in my ears.\r\nThe solitude became intolerable\xe2\x80\x94I placed my hand on the beating heart\r\nof Idris, I bent my head to catch the sound of her breath, to assure\r\nmyself that she still existed\xe2\x80\x94for a moment I doubted whether I should\r\nnot awake her; so effeminate an horror ran through my frame.\xe2\x80\x94Great God!\r\nwould it one day be thus? One day all extinct, save myself, should I\r\nwalk the earth alone? Were these warning voices, whose inarticulate and\r\noracular sense forced belief upon me?\r\n\r\nYet I would not call _them_\r\nVoices of warning, that announce to us\r\nOnly the inevitable. As the sun,\r\nEre it is risen, sometimes paints its image\r\nIn the atmosphere\xe2\x80\x94so often do the spirits\r\nOf great events stride on before the events,\r\nAnd in to-day already walks to-morrow.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] Calderon de la Barca.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] Coleridge\xe2\x80\x99s Translation of Schiller\xe2\x80\x99s Wallenstein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a long interval, I am again impelled by the restless spirit\r\nwithin me to continue my narration; but I must alter the mode which I\r\nhave hitherto adopted. The details contained in the foregoing pages,\r\napparently trivial, yet each slightest one weighing like lead in the\r\ndepressed scale of human afflictions; this tedious dwelling on the\r\nsorrows of others, while my own were only in apprehension; this slowly\r\nlaying bare of my soul\xe2\x80\x99s wounds: this journal of death; this long drawn\r\nand tortuous path, leading to the ocean of countless tears, awakens me\r\nagain to keen grief. I had used this history as an opiate; while it\r\ndescribed my beloved friends, fresh with life and glowing with hope,\r\nactive assistants on the scene, I was soothed; there will be a more\r\nmelancholy pleasure in painting the end of all. But the intermediate\r\nsteps, the climbing the wall, raised up between what was and is, while\r\nI still looked back nor saw the concealed desert beyond, is a labour\r\npast my strength. Time and experience have placed me on an height from\r\nwhich I can comprehend the past as a whole; and in this way I must\r\ndescribe it, bringing forward the leading incidents, and disposing\r\nlight and shade so as to form a picture in whose very darkness there\r\nwill be harmony.\r\n\r\nIt would be needless to narrate those disastrous occurrences, for which\r\na parallel might be found in any slighter visitation of our gigantic\r\ncalamity. Does the reader wish to hear of the pest-houses, where death\r\nis the comforter\xe2\x80\x94of the mournful passage of the death-cart\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\ninsensibility of the worthless, and the anguish of the loving heart\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nharrowing shrieks and silence dire\xe2\x80\x94of the variety of disease,\r\ndesertion, famine, despair, and death? There are many books which can\r\nfeed the appetite craving for these things; let them turn to the\r\naccounts of Boccaccio, De Foe, and Browne. The vast annihilation that\r\nhas swallowed all things\xe2\x80\x94the voiceless solitude of the once busy\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x94the lonely state of singleness which hems me in, has deprived\r\neven such details of their stinging reality, and mellowing the lurid\r\ntints of past anguish with poetic hues, I am able to escape from the\r\nmosaic of circumstance, by perceiving and reflecting back the grouping\r\nand combined colouring of the past.\r\n\r\nI had returned from London possessed by the idea, with the intimate\r\nfeeling that it was my first duty to secure, as well as I was able, the\r\nwell-being of my family, and then to return and take my post beside\r\nAdrian. The events that immediately followed on my arrival at Windsor\r\nchanged this view of things. The plague was not in London alone, it was\r\nevery where\xe2\x80\x94it came on us, as Ryland had said, like a thousand packs of\r\nwolves, howling through the winter night, gaunt and fierce. When once\r\ndisease was introduced into the rural districts, its effects appeared\r\nmore horrible, more exigent, and more difficult to cure, than in towns.\r\nThere was a companionship in suffering there, and, the neighbours\r\nkeeping constant watch on each other, and inspired by the active\r\nbenevolence of Adrian, succour was afforded, and the path of\r\ndestruction smoothed. But in the country, among the scattered\r\nfarm-houses, in lone cottages, in fields, and barns, tragedies were\r\nacted harrowing to the soul, unseen, unheard, unnoticed. Medical aid\r\nwas less easily procured, food was more difficult to obtain, and human\r\nbeings, unwithheld by shame, for they were unbeheld of their fellows,\r\nventured on deeds of greater wickedness, or gave way more readily to\r\ntheir abject fears.\r\n\r\nDeeds of heroism also occurred, whose very mention swells the heart and\r\nbrings tears into the eyes. Such is human nature, that beauty and\r\ndeformity are often closely linked. In reading history we are chiefly\r\nstruck by the generosity and self-devotion that follow close on the\r\nheels of crime, veiling with supernal flowers the stain of blood. Such\r\nacts were not wanting to adorn the grim train that waited on the\r\nprogress of the plague.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Berkshire and Bucks had been long aware that the\r\nplague was in London, in Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, York, in\r\nshort, in all the more populous towns of England. They were not however\r\nthe less astonished and dismayed when it appeared among themselves.\r\nThey were impatient and angry in the midst of terror. They would do\r\nsomething to throw off the clinging evil, and, while in action, they\r\nfancied that a remedy was applied. The inhabitants of the smaller towns\r\nleft their houses, pitched tents in the fields, wandering separate from\r\neach other careless of hunger or the sky\xe2\x80\x99s inclemency, while they\r\nimagined that they avoided the death-dealing disease. The farmers and\r\ncottagers, on the contrary, struck with the fear of solitude, and madly\r\ndesirous of medical assistance, flocked into the towns.\r\n\r\nBut winter was coming, and with winter, hope. In August, the plague had\r\nappeared in the country of England, and during September it made its\r\nravages. Towards the end of October it dwindled away, and was in some\r\ndegree replaced by a typhus, of hardly less virulence. The autumn was\r\nwarm and rainy: the infirm and sickly died off\xe2\x80\x94happier they: many young\r\npeople flushed with health and prosperity, made pale by wasting malady,\r\nbecame the inhabitants of the grave. The crop had failed, the bad corn,\r\nand want of foreign wines, added vigour to disease. Before Christmas\r\nhalf England was under water. The storms of the last winter were\r\nrenewed; but the diminished shipping of this year caused us to feel\r\nless the tempests of the sea. The flood and storms did more harm to\r\ncontinental Europe than to us\xe2\x80\x94giving, as it were, the last blow to the\r\ncalamities which destroyed it. In Italy the rivers were unwatched by\r\nthe diminished peasantry; and, like wild beasts from their lair when\r\nthe hunters and dogs are afar, did Tiber, Arno, and Po, rush upon and\r\ndestroy the fertility of the plains. Whole villages were carried away.\r\nRome, and Florence, and Pisa were overflowed, and their marble palaces,\r\nlate mirrored in tranquil streams, had their foundations shaken by\r\ntheir winter-gifted power. In Germany and Russia the injury was still\r\nmore momentous.\r\n\r\nBut frost would come at last, and with it a renewal of our lease of\r\nearth. Frost would blunt the arrows of pestilence, and enchain the\r\nfurious elements; and the land would in spring throw off her garment of\r\nsnow, released from her menace of destruction. It was not until\r\nFebruary that the desired signs of winter appeared. For three days the\r\nsnow fell, ice stopped the current of the rivers, and the birds flew\r\nout from crackling branches of the frost-whitened trees. On the fourth\r\nmorning all vanished. A south-west wind brought up rain\xe2\x80\x94the sun came\r\nout, and mocking the usual laws of nature, seemed even at this early\r\nseason to burn with solsticial force. It was no consolation, that with\r\nthe first winds of March the lanes were filled with violets, the fruit\r\ntrees covered with blossoms, that the corn sprung up, and the leaves\r\ncame out, forced by the unseasonable heat. We feared the balmy air\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nfeared the cloudless sky, the flower-covered earth, and delightful\r\nwoods, for we looked on the fabric of the universe no longer as our\r\ndwelling, but our tomb, and the fragrant land smelled to the\r\napprehension of fear like a wide church-yard.\r\n\r\nPisando la tierra dura\r\nde continuo el hombre est\xc3\xa0\r\ny cada passo que d\xc3\xa0\r\nes sobre su sepultura.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nYet notwithstanding these disadvantages winter was breathing time; and\r\nwe exerted ourselves to make the best of it. Plague might not revive\r\nwith the summer; but if it did, it should find us prepared. It is a\r\npart of man\xe2\x80\x99s nature to adapt itself through habit even to pain and\r\nsorrow. Pestilence had become a part of our future, our existence; it\r\nwas to be guarded against, like the flooding of rivers, the\r\nencroachments of ocean, or the inclemency of the sky. After long\r\nsuffering and bitter experience, some panacea might be discovered; as\r\nit was, all that received infection died\xe2\x80\x94 all however were not\r\ninfected; and it became our part to fix deep the foundations, and raise\r\nhigh the barrier between contagion and the sane; to introduce such\r\norder as would conduce to the well-being of the survivors, and as would\r\npreserve hope and some portion of happiness to those who were\r\nspectators of the still renewed tragedy. Adrian had introduced\r\nsystematic modes of proceeding in the metropolis, which, while they\r\nwere unable to stop the progress of death, yet prevented other evils,\r\nvice and folly, from rendering the awful fate of the hour still more\r\ntremendous. I wished to imitate his example, but men are used to\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94move all together, if they move at all,[11]\r\n\r\n\r\nand I could find no means of leading the inhabitants of scattered towns\r\nand villages, who forgot my words as soon as they heard them not, and\r\nveered with every baffling wind, that might arise from an apparent\r\nchange of circumstance.\r\n\r\nI adopted another plan. Those writers who have imagined a reign of\r\npeace and happiness on earth, have generally described a rural country,\r\nwhere each small township was directed by the elders and wise men. This\r\nwas the key of my design. Each village, however small, usually contains\r\na leader, one among themselves whom they venerate, whose advice they\r\nseek in difficulty, and whose good opinion they chiefly value. I was\r\nimmediately drawn to make this observation by occurrences that\r\npresented themselves to my personal experience.\r\n\r\nIn the village of Little Marlow an old woman ruled the community. She\r\nhad lived for some years in an alms-house, and on fine Sundays her\r\nthreshold was constantly beset by a crowd, seeking her advice and\r\nlistening to her admonitions. She had been a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and had\r\nseen the world; infirmity, induced by fevers caught in unwholesome\r\nquarters, had come on her before its time, and she seldom moved from\r\nher little cot. The plague entered the village; and, while fright and\r\ngrief deprived the inhabitants of the little wisdom they possessed, old\r\nMartha stepped forward and said\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cBefore now I have been in a town\r\nwhere there was the plague.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you escaped?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I\r\nrecovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94After this Martha was seated more firmly than ever on the\r\nregal seat, elevated by reverence and love. She entered the cottages of\r\nthe sick; she relieved their wants with her own hand; she betrayed no\r\nfear, and inspired all who saw her with some portion of her own native\r\ncourage. She attended the markets\xe2\x80\x94she insisted upon being supplied with\r\nfood for those who were too poor to purchase it. She shewed them how\r\nthe well-being of each included the prosperity of all. She would not\r\npermit the gardens to be neglected, nor the very flowers in the cottage\r\nlattices to droop from want of care. Hope, she said, was better than a\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s prescription, and every thing that could sustain and enliven\r\nthe spirits, of more worth than drugs and mixtures.\r\n\r\nIt was the sight of Little Marlow, and my conversations with Martha,\r\nthat led me to the plan I formed. I had before visited the manor houses\r\nand gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s seats, and often found the inhabitants actuated by the\r\npurest benevolence, ready to lend their utmost aid for the welfare of\r\ntheir tenants. But this was not enough. The intimate sympathy generated\r\nby similar hopes and fears, similar experience and pursuits, was\r\nwanting here. The poor perceived that the rich possessed other means of\r\npreservation than those which could be partaken of by themselves,\r\nseclusion, and, as far as circumstances permitted, freedom from care.\r\nThey could not place reliance on them, but turned with tenfold\r\ndependence to the succour and advice of their equals. I resolved\r\ntherefore to go from village to village, seeking out the rustic archon\r\nof the place, and by systematizing their exertions, and enlightening\r\ntheir views, encrease both their power and their use among their\r\nfellow-cottagers. Many changes also now occurred in these spontaneous\r\nregal elections: depositions and abdications were frequent, while, in\r\nthe place of the old and prudent, the ardent youth would step forward,\r\neager for action, regardless of danger. Often too, the voice to which\r\nall listened was suddenly silenced, the helping hand cold, the\r\nsympathetic eye closed, and the villagers feared still more the death\r\nthat had selected a choice victim, shivering in dust the heart that had\r\nbeat for them, reducing to incommunicable annihilation the mind for\r\never occupied with projects for their welfare.\r\n\r\nWhoever labours for man must often find ingratitude, watered by vice\r\nand folly, spring from the grain which he has sown. Death, which had in\r\nour younger days walked the earth like \xe2\x80\x9ca thief that comes in the\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x9d now, rising from his subterranean vault, girt with power, with\r\ndark banner floating, came a conqueror. Many saw, seated above his\r\nvice-regal throne, a supreme Providence, who directed his shafts, and\r\nguided his progress, and they bowed their heads in resignation, or at\r\nleast in obedience. Others perceived only a passing casualty; they\r\nendeavoured to exchange terror for heedlessness, and plunged into\r\nlicentiousness, to avoid the agonizing throes of worst apprehension.\r\nThus, while the wise, the good, and the prudent were occupied by the\r\nlabours of benevolence, the truce of winter produced other effects\r\namong the young, the thoughtless, and the vicious. During the colder\r\nmonths there was a general rush to London in search of amusement\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nties of public opinion were loosened; many were rich, heretofore\r\npoor\xe2\x80\x94many had lost father and mother, the guardians of their morals,\r\ntheir mentors and restraints. It would have been useless to have\r\nopposed these impulses by barriers, which would only have driven those\r\nactuated by them to more pernicious indulgencies. The theatres were\r\nopen and thronged; dance and midnight festival were frequented\xe2\x80\x94in many\r\nof these decorum was violated, and the evils, which hitherto adhered to\r\nan advanced state of civilization, were doubled. The student left his\r\nbooks, the artist his study: the occupations of life were gone, but the\r\namusements remained; enjoyment might be protracted to the verge of the\r\ngrave. All factitious colouring disappeared\xe2\x80\x94death rose like night, and,\r\nprotected by its murky shadows the blush of modesty, the reserve of\r\npride, the decorum of prudery were frequently thrown aside as useless\r\nveils. This was not universal. Among better natures, anguish and dread,\r\nthe fear of eternal separation, and the awful wonder produced by\r\nunprecedented calamity, drew closer the ties of kindred and friendship.\r\nPhilosophers opposed their principles, as barriers to the inundation of\r\nprofligacy or despair, and the only ramparts to protect the invaded\r\nterritory of human life; the religious, hoping now for their reward,\r\nclung fast to their creeds, as the rafts and planks which over the\r\ntempest-vexed sea of suffering, would bear them in safety to the\r\nharbour of the Unknown Continent. The loving heart, obliged to contract\r\nits view, bestowed its overflow of affection in triple portion on the\r\nfew that remained. Yet, even among these, the present, as an\r\nunalienable possession, became all of time to which they dared commit\r\nthe precious freight of their hopes.\r\n\r\nThe experience of immemorial time had taught us formerly to count our\r\nenjoyments by years, and extend our prospect of life through a\r\nlengthened period of progression and decay; the long road threaded a\r\nvast labyrinth, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death, in which it\r\nterminated, was hid by intervening objects. But an earthquake had\r\nchanged the scene\xe2\x80\x94under our very feet the earth yawned\xe2\x80\x94deep and\r\nprecipitous the gulph below opened to receive us, while the hours\r\ncharioted us towards the chasm. But it was winter now, and months must\r\nelapse before we are hurled from our security. We became ephemera, to\r\nwhom the interval between the rising and setting sun was as a long\r\ndrawn year of common time. We should never see our children ripen into\r\nmaturity, nor behold their downy cheeks roughen, their blithe hearts\r\nsubdued by passion or care; but we had them now\xe2\x80\x94they lived, and we\r\nlived\xe2\x80\x94what more could we desire? With such schooling did my poor Idris\r\ntry to hush thronging fears, and in some measure succeeded. It was not\r\nas in summer-time, when each hour might bring the dreaded fate\xe2\x80\x94until\r\nsummer, we felt sure; and this certainty, short lived as it must be,\r\nyet for awhile satisfied her maternal tenderness. I know not how to\r\nexpress or communicate the sense of concentrated, intense, though\r\nevanescent transport, that imparadized us in the present hour. Our joys\r\nwere dearer because we saw their end; they were keener because we felt,\r\nto its fullest extent, their value; they were purer because their\r\nessence was sympathy\xe2\x80\x94 as a meteor is brighter than a star, did the\r\nfelicity of this winter contain in itself the extracted delights of a\r\nlong, long life.\r\n\r\nHow lovely is spring! As we looked from Windsor Terrace on the sixteen\r\nfertile counties spread beneath, speckled by happy cottages and\r\nwealthier towns, all looked as in former years, heart-cheering and\r\nfair. The land was ploughed, the slender blades of wheat broke through\r\nthe dark soil, the fruit trees were covered with buds, the husbandman\r\nwas abroad in the fields, the milk-maid tripped home with well-filled\r\npails, the swallows and martins struck the sunny pools with their long,\r\npointed wings, the new dropped lambs reposed on the young grass, the\r\ntender growth of leaves\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLifts its sweet head into the air, and feeds\r\nA silent space with ever sprouting green.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nMan himself seemed to regenerate, and feel the frost of winter yield to\r\nan elastic and warm renewal of life\xe2\x80\x94reason told us that care and sorrow\r\nwould grow with the opening year\xe2\x80\x94but how to believe the ominous voice\r\nbreathed up with pestiferous vapours from fear\xe2\x80\x99s dim cavern, while\r\nnature, laughing and scattering from her green lap flowers, and fruits,\r\nand sparkling waters, invited us to join the gay masque of young life\r\nshe led upon the scene?\r\n\r\nWhere was the plague? \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94every where!\xe2\x80\x9d one voice of horror and\r\ndismay exclaimed, when in the pleasant days of a sunny May the\r\nDestroyer of man brooded again over the earth, forcing the spirit to\r\nleave its organic chrysalis, and to enter upon an untried life. With\r\none mighty sweep of its potent weapon, all caution, all care, all\r\nprudence were levelled low: death sat at the tables of the great,\r\nstretched itself on the cottager\xe2\x80\x99s pallet, seized the dastard who fled,\r\nquelled the brave man who resisted: despondency entered every heart,\r\nsorrow dimmed every eye.\r\n\r\nSights of woe now became familiar to me, and were I to tell all of\r\nanguish and pain that I witnessed, of the despairing moans of age, and\r\nthe more terrible smiles of infancy in the bosom of horror, my reader,\r\nhis limbs quivering and his hair on end, would wonder how I did not,\r\nseized with sudden frenzy, dash myself from some precipice, and so\r\nclose my eyes for ever on the sad end of the world. But the powers of\r\nlove, poetry, and creative fancy will dwell even beside the sick of the\r\nplague, with the squalid, and with the dying. A feeling of devotion, of\r\nduty, of a high and steady purpose, elevated me; a strange joy filled\r\nmy heart. In the midst of saddest grief I seemed to tread air, while\r\nthe spirit of good shed round me an ambrosial atmosphere, which blunted\r\nthe sting of sympathy, and purified the air of sighs. If my wearied\r\nsoul flagged in its career, I thought of my loved home, of the casket\r\nthat contained my treasures, of the kiss of love and the filial caress,\r\nwhile my eyes were moistened by purest dew, and my heart was at once\r\nsoftened and refreshed by thrilling tenderness.\r\n\r\nMaternal affection had not rendered Idris selfish; at the beginning of\r\nour calamity she had, with thoughtless enthusiasm, devoted herself to\r\nthe care of the sick and helpless. I checked her; and she submitted to\r\nmy rule. I told her how the fear of her danger palsied my exertions,\r\nhow the knowledge of her safety strung my nerves to endurance. I shewed\r\nher the dangers which her children incurred during her absence; and she\r\nat length agreed not to go beyond the inclosure of the forest. Indeed,\r\nwithin the walls of the Castle we had a colony of the unhappy, deserted\r\nby their relatives, and in themselves helpless, sufficient to occupy\r\nher time and attention, while ceaseless anxiety for my welfare and the\r\nhealth of her children, however she strove to curb or conceal it,\r\nabsorbed all her thoughts, and undermined the vital principle. After\r\nwatching over and providing for their safety, her second care was to\r\nhide from me her anguish and tears. Each night I returned to the\r\nCastle, and found there repose and love awaiting me. Often I waited\r\nbeside the bed of death till midnight, and through the obscurity of\r\nrainy, cloudy nights rode many miles, sustained by one circumstance\r\nonly, the safety and sheltered repose of those I loved. If some scene\r\nof tremendous agony shook my frame and fevered my brow, I would lay my\r\nhead on the lap of Idris, and the tumultuous pulses subsided into a\r\ntemperate flow \xe2\x80\x94her smile could raise me from hopelessness, her embrace\r\nbathe my sorrowing heart in calm peace. Summer advanced, and, crowned\r\nwith the sun\xe2\x80\x99s potent rays, plague shot her unerring shafts over the\r\nearth. The nations beneath their influence bowed their heads, and died.\r\nThe corn that sprung up in plenty, lay in autumn rotting on the ground,\r\nwhile the melancholy wretch who had gone out to gather bread for his\r\nchildren, lay stiff and plague-struck in the furrow. The green woods\r\nwaved their boughs majestically, while the dying were spread beneath\r\ntheir shade, answering the solemn melody with inharmonious cries. The\r\npainted birds flitted through the shades; the careless deer reposed\r\nunhurt upon the fern\xe2\x80\x94the oxen and the horses strayed from their\r\nunguarded stables, and grazed among the wheat, for death fell on man\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWith summer and mortality grew our fears. My poor love and I looked at\r\neach other, and our babes.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWe will save them, Idris,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nsave them. Years hence we shall recount to them our fears, then passed\r\naway with their occasion. Though they only should remain on the earth,\r\nstill they shall live, nor shall their cheeks become pale nor their\r\nsweet voices languish.\xe2\x80\x9d Our eldest in some degree understood the scenes\r\npassing around, and at times, he with serious looks questioned me\r\nconcerning the reason of so vast a desolation. But he was only ten\r\nyears old; and the hilarity of youth soon chased unreasonable care from\r\nhis brow. Evelyn, a laughing cherub, a gamesome infant, without idea of\r\npain or sorrow, would, shaking back his light curls from his eyes, make\r\nthe halls re-echo with his merriment, and in a thousand artless ways\r\nattract our attention to his play. Clara, our lovely gentle Clara, was\r\nour stay, our solace, our delight. She made it her task to attend the\r\nsick, comfort the sorrowing, assist the aged, and partake the sports\r\nand awaken the gaiety of the young. She flitted through the rooms, like\r\na good spirit, dispatched from the celestial kingdom, to illumine our\r\ndark hour with alien splendour. Gratitude and praise marked where her\r\nfootsteps had been. Yet, when she stood in unassuming simplicity before\r\nus, playing with our children, or with girlish assiduity performing\r\nlittle kind offices for Idris, one wondered in what fair lineament of\r\nher pure loveliness, in what soft tone of her thrilling voice, so much\r\nof heroism, sagacity and active goodness resided.\r\n\r\nThe summer passed tediously, for we trusted that winter would at least\r\ncheck the disease. That it would vanish altogether was an hope too\r\ndear\xe2\x80\x94 too heartfelt, to be expressed. When such a thought was\r\nheedlessly uttered, the hearers, with a gush of tears and passionate\r\nsobs, bore witness how deep their fears were, how small their hopes.\r\nFor my own part, my exertions for the public good permitted me to\r\nobserve more closely than most others, the virulence and extensive\r\nravages of our sightless enemy. A short month has destroyed a village,\r\nand where in May the first person sickened, in June the paths were\r\ndeformed by unburied corpses\xe2\x80\x94the houses tenantless, no smoke arising\r\nfrom the chimneys; and the housewife\xe2\x80\x99s clock marked only the hour when\r\ndeath had been triumphant. From such scenes I have sometimes saved a\r\ndeserted infant\xe2\x80\x94sometimes led a young and grieving mother from the\r\nlifeless image of her first born, or drawn the sturdy labourer from\r\nchildish weeping over his extinct family.\r\n\r\nJuly is gone. August must pass, and by the middle of September we may\r\nhope. Each day was eagerly counted; and the inhabitants of towns,\r\ndesirous to leap this dangerous interval, plunged into dissipation, and\r\nstrove, by riot, and what they wished to imagine to be pleasure, to\r\nbanish thought and opiate despair. None but Adrian could have tamed the\r\nmotley population of London, which, like a troop of unbitted steeds\r\nrushing to their pastures, had thrown aside all minor fears, through\r\nthe operation of the fear paramount. Even Adrian was obliged in part to\r\nyield, that he might be able, if not to guide, at least to set bounds\r\nto the license of the times. The theatres were kept open; every place\r\nof public resort was frequented; though he endeavoured so to modify\r\nthem, as might best quiet the agitation of the spectators, and at the\r\nsame time prevent a reaction of misery when the excitement was over.\r\nTragedies deep and dire were the chief favourites. Comedy brought with\r\nit too great a contrast to the inner despair: when such were attempted,\r\nit was not unfrequent for a comedian, in the midst of the laughter\r\noccasioned by his disporportioned buffoonery, to find a word or thought\r\nin his part that jarred with his own sense of wretchedness, and burst\r\nfrom mimic merriment into sobs and tears, while the spectators, seized\r\nwith irresistible sympathy, wept, and the pantomimic revelry was\r\nchanged to a real exhibition of tragic passion.\r\n\r\nIt was not in my nature to derive consolation from such scenes; from\r\ntheatres, whose buffoon laughter and discordant mirth awakened\r\ndistempered sympathy, or where fictitious tears and wailings mocked the\r\nheart-felt grief within; from festival or crowded meeting, where\r\nhilarity sprung from the worst feelings of our nature, or such\r\nenthralment of the better ones, as impressed it with garish and false\r\nvarnish; from assemblies of mourners in the guise of revellers. Once\r\nhowever I witnessed a scene of singular interest at one of the\r\ntheatres, where nature overpowered art, as an overflowing cataract will\r\ntear away the puny manufacture of a mock cascade, which had before been\r\nfed by a small portion of its waters.\r\n\r\nI had come to London to see Adrian. He was not at the palace; and,\r\nthough the attendants did not know whither he had gone, they did not\r\nexpect him till late at night. It was between six and seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, a\r\nfine summer afternoon, and I spent my leisure hours in a ramble through\r\nthe empty streets of London; now turning to avoid an approaching\r\nfuneral, now urged by curiosity to observe the state of a particular\r\nspot; my wanderings were instinct with pain, for silence and desertion\r\ncharacterized every place I visited, and the few beings I met were so\r\npale and woe-begone, so marked with care and depressed by fear, that\r\nweary of encountering only signs of misery, I began to retread my steps\r\ntowards home.\r\n\r\nI was now in Holborn, and passed by a public house filled with\r\nuproarious companions, whose songs, laughter, and shouts were more\r\nsorrowful than the pale looks and silence of the mourner. Such an one\r\nwas near, hovering round this house. The sorry plight of her dress\r\ndisplayed her poverty, she was ghastly pale, and continued approaching,\r\nfirst the window and then the door of the house, as if fearful, yet\r\nlonging to enter. A sudden burst of song and merriment seemed to sting\r\nher to the heart; she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cCan he have the heart?\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\nmustering her courage, she stepped within the threshold. The landlady\r\nmet her in the passage; the poor creature asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIs my husband here?\r\nCan I see George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee him,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, if you go to him; last night he was\r\ntaken with the plague, and we sent him to the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate inquirer staggered against a wall, a faint cry escaped\r\nher \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cO! were you cruel enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cto send him there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlady meanwhile hurried away; but a more compassionate bar-maid\r\ngave her a detailed account, the sum of which was, that her husband had\r\nbeen taken ill, after a night of riot, and sent by his boon companions\r\nwith all expedition to St. Bartholomew\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital. I had watched this\r\nscene, for there was a gentleness about the poor woman that interested\r\nme; she now tottered away from the door, walking as well as she could\r\ndown Holborn Hill; but her strength soon failed her; she leaned against\r\na wall, and her head sunk on her bosom, while her pallid cheek became\r\nstill more white. I went up to her and offered my services. She hardly\r\nlooked up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou can do me no good,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI must go to the\r\nhospital; if I do not die before I get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were still a few hackney-coaches accustomed to stand about the\r\nstreets, more truly from habit than for use. I put her in one of these,\r\nand entered with her that I might secure her entrance into the\r\nhospital. Our way was short, and she said little; except interrupted\r\nejaculations of reproach that he had left her, exclamations on the\r\nunkindness of some of his friends, and hope that she would find him\r\nalive. There was a simple, natural earnestness about her that\r\ninterested me in her fate, especially when she assured me that her\r\nhusband was the best of men,\xe2\x80\x94had been so, till want of business during\r\nthese unhappy times had thrown him into bad company. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could not bear\r\nto come home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9conly to see our children die. A man cannot\r\nhave the patience a mother has, with her own flesh and blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were set down at St. Bartholomew\xe2\x80\x99s, and entered the wretched\r\nprecincts of the house of disease. The poor creature clung closer to\r\nme, as she saw with what heartless haste they bore the dead from the\r\nwards, and took them into a room, whose half-opened door displayed a\r\nnumber of corpses, horrible to behold by one unaccustomed to such\r\nscenes. We were directed to the ward where her husband had been first\r\ntaken, and still was, the nurse said, if alive. My companion looked\r\neagerly from one bed to the other, till at the end of the ward she\r\nespied, on a wretched bed, a squalid, haggard creature, writhing under\r\nthe torture of disease. She rushed towards him, she embraced him,\r\nblessing God for his preservation.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm that inspired her with this strange joy, blinded her to\r\nthe horrors about her; but they were intolerably agonizing to me. The\r\nward was filled with an effluvia that caused my heart to heave with\r\npainful qualms. The dead were carried out, and the sick brought in,\r\nwith like indifference; some were screaming with pain, others laughing\r\nfrom the influence of more terrible delirium; some were attended by\r\nweeping, despairing relations, others called aloud with thrilling\r\ntenderness or reproach on the friends who had deserted them, while the\r\nnurses went from bed to bed, incarnate images of despair, neglect, and\r\ndeath. I gave gold to my luckless companion; I recommended her to the\r\ncare of the attendants; I then hastened away; while the tormentor, the\r\nimagination, busied itself in picturing my own loved ones, stretched on\r\nsuch beds, attended thus. The country afforded no such mass of horrors;\r\nsolitary wretches died in the open fields; and I have found a survivor\r\nin a vacant village, contending at once with famine and disease; but\r\nthe assembly of pestilence, the banqueting hall of death, was spread\r\nonly in London.\r\n\r\nI rambled on, oppressed, distracted by painful emotions\xe2\x80\x94suddenly I\r\nfound myself before Drury Lane Theatre. The play was Macbeth\xe2\x80\x94the first\r\nactor of the age was there to exert his powers to drug with\r\nirreflection the auditors; such a medicine I yearned for, so I entered.\r\nThe theatre was tolerably well filled. Shakspeare, whose popularity was\r\nestablished by the approval of four centuries, had not lost his\r\ninfluence even at this dread period; but was still \xe2\x80\x9cUt magus,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nwizard to rule our hearts and govern our imaginations. I came in during\r\nthe interval between the third and fourth act. I looked round on the\r\naudience; the females were mostly of the lower classes, but the men\r\nwere of all ranks, come hither to forget awhile the protracted scenes\r\nof wretchedness, which awaited them at their miserable homes. The\r\ncurtain drew up, and the stage presented the scene of the witches\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncave. The wildness and supernatural machinery of Macbeth, was a pledge\r\nthat it could contain little directly connected with our present\r\ncircumstances. Great pains had been taken in the scenery to give the\r\nsemblance of reality to the impossible. The extreme darkness of the\r\nstage, whose only light was received from the fire under the cauldron,\r\njoined to a kind of mist that floated about it, rendered the unearthly\r\nshapes of the witches obscure and shadowy. It was not three decrepid\r\nold hags that bent over their pot throwing in the grim ingredients of\r\nthe magic charm, but forms frightful, unreal, and fanciful. The\r\nentrance of Hecate, and the wild music that followed, took us out of\r\nthis world. The cavern shape the stage assumed, the beetling rocks, the\r\nglare of the fire, the misty shades that crossed the scene at times,\r\nthe music in harmony with all witch-like fancies, permitted the\r\nimagination to revel, without fear of contradiction, or reproof from\r\nreason or the heart. The entrance of Macbeth did not destroy the\r\nillusion, for he was actuated by the same feelings that inspired us,\r\nand while the work of magic proceeded we sympathized in his wonder and\r\nhis daring, and gave ourselves up with our whole souls to the influence\r\nof scenic delusion. I felt the beneficial result of such excitement, in\r\na renewal of those pleasing flights of fancy to which I had long been a\r\nstranger. The effect of this scene of incantation communicated a\r\nportion of its power to that which followed. We forgot that Malcolm and\r\nMacduff were mere human beings, acted upon by such simple passions as\r\nwarmed our own breasts. By slow degrees however we were drawn to the\r\nreal interest of the scene. A shudder like the swift passing of an\r\nelectric shock ran through the house, when Rosse exclaimed, in answer\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cStands Scotland where it did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n        Alas, poor country;\r\nAlmost afraid to know itself! It cannot\r\nBe called our mother, but our grave: where nothing,\r\nBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\r\nWhere sighs, and groans, and shrieks that rent the air,\r\nAre made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems\r\nA modern extasy: the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s knell\r\nIs there scarce asked, for who; and good men\xe2\x80\x99s lives\r\nExpire before the flowers in their caps,\r\nDying, or ere they sicken.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach word struck the sense, as our life\xe2\x80\x99s passing bell; we feared to\r\nlook at each other, but bent our gaze on the stage, as if our eyes\r\ncould fall innocuous on that alone. The person who played the part of\r\nRosse, suddenly became aware of the dangerous ground he trod. He was an\r\ninferior actor, but truth now made him excellent; as he went on to\r\nannounce to Macduff the slaughter of his family, he was afraid to\r\nspeak, trembling from apprehension of a burst of grief from the\r\naudience, not from his fellow-mime. Each word was drawn out with\r\ndifficulty; real anguish painted his features; his eyes were now lifted\r\nin sudden horror, now fixed in dread upon the ground. This shew of\r\nterror encreased ours, we gasped with him, each neck was stretched out,\r\neach face changed with the actor\xe2\x80\x99s changes\xe2\x80\x94 at length while Macduff,\r\nwho, attending to his part, was unobservant of the high wrought\r\nsympathy of the house, cried with well acted passion:\r\n\r\n        All my pretty ones?\r\nDid you say all?\xe2\x80\x94O hell kite! All?\r\nWhat! all my pretty chickens, and their dam,\r\nAt one fell swoop!\r\n\r\n\r\nA pang of tameless grief wrenched every heart, a burst of despair was\r\nechoed from every lip.\xe2\x80\x94I had entered into the universal feeling\xe2\x80\x94I had\r\nbeen absorbed by the terrors of Rosse\xe2\x80\x94I re-echoed the cry of Macduff,\r\nand then rushed out as from an hell of torture, to find calm in the\r\nfree air and silent street.\r\n\r\nFree the air was not, or the street silent. Oh, how I longed then for\r\nthe dear soothings of maternal Nature, as my wounded heart was still\r\nfurther stung by the roar of heartless merriment from the public-house,\r\nby the sight of the drunkard reeling home, having lost the memory of\r\nwhat he would find there in oblivious debauch, and by the more\r\nappalling salutations of those melancholy beings to whom the name of\r\nhome was a mockery. I ran on at my utmost speed until I found myself I\r\nknew not how, close to Westminster Abbey, and was attracted by the deep\r\nand swelling tone of the organ. I entered with soothing awe the lighted\r\nchancel, and listened to the solemn religious chaunt, which spoke peace\r\nand hope to the unhappy. The notes, freighted with man\xe2\x80\x99s dearest\r\nprayers, re-echoed through the dim aisles, and the bleeding of the\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x99s wounds was staunched by heavenly balm. In spite of the misery I\r\ndeprecated, and could not understand; in spite of the cold hearths of\r\nwide London, and the corpse-strewn fields of my native land; in spite\r\nof all the variety of agonizing emotions I had that evening\r\nexperienced, I thought that in reply to our melodious adjurations, the\r\nCreator looked down in compassion and promise of relief; the awful peal\r\nof the heaven-winged music seemed fitting voice wherewith to commune\r\nwith the Supreme; calm was produced by its sound, and by the sight of\r\nmany other human creatures offering up prayers and submission with me.\r\nA sentiment approaching happiness followed the total resignation of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s being to the guardianship of the world\xe2\x80\x99s ruler. Alas! with the\r\nfailing of this solemn strain, the elevated spirit sank again to earth.\r\nSuddenly one of the choristers died\xe2\x80\x94he was lifted from his desk, the\r\nvaults below were hastily opened\xe2\x80\x94he was consigned with a few muttered\r\nprayers to the darksome cavern, abode of thousands who had gone\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94now wide yawning to receive even all who fulfilled the funeral\r\nrites. In vain I would then have turned from this scene, to darkened\r\naisle or lofty dome, echoing with melodious praise. In the open air\r\nalone I found relief; among nature\xe2\x80\x99s beauteous works, her God reassumed\r\nhis attribute of benevolence, and again I could trust that he who built\r\nup the mountains, planted the forests, and poured out the rivers, would\r\nerect another state for lost humanity, where we might awaken again to\r\nour affections, our happiness, and our faith.\r\n\r\nFortunately for me those circumstances were of rare occurrence that\r\nobliged me to visit London, and my duties were confined to the rural\r\ndistrict which our lofty castle overlooked; and here labour stood in\r\nthe place of pastime, to occupy such of the country people as were\r\nsufficiently exempt from sorrow or disease. My endeavours were directed\r\ntowards urging them to their usual attention to their crops, and to the\r\nacting as if pestilence did not exist. The mower\xe2\x80\x99s scythe was at times\r\nheard; yet the joyless haymakers after they had listlessly turned the\r\ngrass, forgot to cart it; the shepherd, when he had sheared his sheep,\r\nwould let the wool lie to be scattered by the winds, deeming it useless\r\nto provide clothing for another winter. At times however the spirit of\r\nlife was awakened by these employments; the sun, the refreshing breeze,\r\nthe sweet smell of the hay, the rustling leaves and prattling rivulets\r\nbrought repose to the agitated bosom, and bestowed a feeling akin to\r\nhappiness on the apprehensive. Nor, strange to say, was the time\r\nwithout its pleasures. Young couples, who had loved long and\r\nhopelessly, suddenly found every impediment removed, and wealth pour in\r\nfrom the death of relatives. The very danger drew them closer. The\r\nimmediate peril urged them to seize the immediate opportunity; wildly\r\nand passionately they sought to know what delights existence afforded,\r\nbefore they yielded to death, and\r\n\r\nSnatching their pleasures with rough strife\r\nThorough the iron gates of life,[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nthey defied the conquering pestilence to destroy what had been, or to\r\nerase even from their death-bed thoughts the sentiment of happiness\r\nwhich had been theirs.\r\n\r\nOne instance of this kind came immediately under our notice, where a\r\nhigh-born girl had in early youth given her heart to one of meaner\r\nextraction. He was a schoolfellow and friend of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nusually spent a part of the holidays at the mansion of the duke her\r\nfather. They had played together as children, been the confidants of\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s little secrets, mutual aids and consolers in difficulty\r\nand sorrow. Love had crept in, noiseless, terrorless at first, till\r\neach felt their life bound up in the other, and at the same time knew\r\nthat they must part. Their extreme youth, and the purity of their\r\nattachment, made them yield with less resistance to the tyranny of\r\ncircumstances. The father of the fair Juliet separated them; but not\r\nuntil the young lover had promised to remain absent only till he had\r\nrendered himself worthy of her, and she had vowed to preserve her\r\nvirgin heart, his treasure, till he returned to claim and possess it.\r\n\r\nPlague came, threatening to destroy at once the aim of the ambitious\r\nand the hopes of love. Long the Duke of L\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94derided the idea that there\r\ncould be danger while he pursued his plans of cautious seclusion; and\r\nhe so far succeeded, that it was not till this second summer, that the\r\ndestroyer, at one fell stroke, overthrew his precautions, his security,\r\nand his life. Poor Juliet saw one by one, father, mother, brothers, and\r\nsisters, sicken and die. Most of the servants fled on the first\r\nappearance of disease, those who remained were infected mortally; no\r\nneighbour or rustic ventured within the verge of contagion. By a\r\nstrange fatality Juliet alone escaped, and she to the last waited on\r\nher relatives, and smoothed the pillow of death. The moment at length\r\ncame, when the last blow was given to the last of the house: the\r\nyouthful survivor of her race sat alone among the dead. There was no\r\nliving being near to soothe her, or withdraw her from this hideous\r\ncompany. With the declining heat of a September night, a whirlwind of\r\nstorm, thunder, and hail, rattled round the house, and with ghastly\r\nharmony sung the dirge of her family. She sat upon the ground absorbed\r\nin wordless despair, when through the gusty wind and bickering rain she\r\nthought she heard her name called. Whose could that familiar voice be?\r\nNot one of her relations, for they lay glaring on her with stony eyes.\r\nAgain her name was syllabled, and she shuddered as she asked herself,\r\nam I becoming mad, or am I dying, that I hear the voices of the\r\ndeparted? A second thought passed, swift as an arrow, into her brain;\r\nshe rushed to the window; and a flash of lightning shewed to her the\r\nexpected vision, her lover in the shrubbery beneath; joy lent her\r\nstrength to descend the stairs, to open the door, and then she fainted\r\nin his supporting arms.\r\n\r\nA thousand times she reproached herself, as with a crime, that she\r\nshould revive to happiness with him. The natural clinging of the human\r\nmind to life and joy was in its full energy in her young heart; she\r\ngave herself impetuously up to the enchantment: they were married; and\r\nin their radiant features I saw incarnate, for the last time, the\r\nspirit of love, of rapturous sympathy, which once had been the life of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nI envied them, but felt how impossible it was to imbibe the same\r\nfeeling, now that years had multiplied my ties in the world. Above all,\r\nthe anxious mother, my own beloved and drooping Idris, claimed my\r\nearnest care; I could not reproach the anxiety that never for a moment\r\nslept in her heart, but I exerted myself to distract her attention from\r\ntoo keen an observation of the truth of things, of the near and nearer\r\napproaches of disease, misery, and death, of the wild look of our\r\nattendants as intelligence of another and yet another death reached us;\r\nfor to the last something new occurred that seemed to transcend in\r\nhorror all that had gone before. Wretched beings crawled to die under\r\nour succouring roof; the inhabitants of the Castle decreased daily,\r\nwhile the survivors huddled together in fear, and, as in a\r\nfamine-struck boat, the sport of the wild, interminable waves, each\r\nlooked in the other\xe2\x80\x99s face, to guess on whom the death-lot would next\r\nfall. All this I endeavoured to veil, so that it might least impress my\r\nIdris; yet, as I have said, my courage survived even despair: I might\r\nbe vanquished, but I would not yield.\r\n\r\nOne day, it was the ninth of September, seemed devoted to every\r\ndisaster, to every harrowing incident. Early in the day, I heard of the\r\narrival of the aged grandmother of one of our servants at the Castle.\r\nThis old woman had reached her hundredth year; her skin was shrivelled,\r\nher form was bent and lost in extreme decrepitude; but as still from\r\nyear to year she continued in existence, out-living many younger and\r\nstronger, she began to feel as if she were to live for ever. The plague\r\ncame, and the inhabitants of her village died. Clinging, with the\r\ndastard feeling of the aged, to the remnant of her spent life, she had,\r\non hearing that the pestilence had come into her neighbourhood, barred\r\nher door, and closed her casement, refusing to communicate with any.\r\nShe would wander out at night to get food, and returned home, pleased\r\nthat she had met no one, that she was in no danger from the plague. As\r\nthe earth became more desolate, her difficulty in acquiring sustenance\r\nincreased; at first, her son, who lived near, had humoured her by\r\nplacing articles of food in her way: at last he died. But, even though\r\nthreatened by famine, her fear of the plague was paramount; and her\r\ngreatest care was to avoid her fellow creatures. She grew weaker each\r\nday, and each day she had further to go. The night before, she had\r\nreached Datchet; and, prowling about, had found a baker\xe2\x80\x99s shop open and\r\ndeserted. Laden with spoil, she hastened to return, and lost her way.\r\nThe night was windless, hot, and cloudy; her load became too heavy for\r\nher; and one by one she threw away her loaves, still endeavouring to\r\nget along, though her hobbling fell into lameness, and her weakness at\r\nlast into inability to move.\r\n\r\nShe lay down among the tall corn, and fell asleep. Deep in midnight,\r\nshe was awaked by a rustling near her; she would have started up, but\r\nher stiff joints refused to obey her will. A low moan close to her ear\r\nfollowed, and the rustling increased; she heard a smothered voice\r\nbreathe out, Water, Water! several times; and then again a sigh heaved\r\nfrom the heart of the sufferer. The old woman shuddered, she contrived\r\nat length to sit upright; but her teeth chattered, and her knees\r\nknocked together\xe2\x80\x94close, very close, lay a half-naked figure, just\r\ndiscernible in the gloom, and the cry for water and the stifled moan\r\nwere again uttered. Her motions at length attracted the attention of\r\nher unknown companion; her hand was seized with a convulsive violence\r\nthat made the grasp feel like iron, the fingers like the keen teeth of\r\na trap.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAt last you are come!\xe2\x80\x9d were the words given forth\xe2\x80\x94but this\r\nexertion was the last effort of the dying\xe2\x80\x94the joints relaxed, the\r\nfigure fell prostrate, one low moan, the last, marked the moment of\r\ndeath. Morning broke; and the old woman saw the corpse, marked with the\r\nfatal disease, close to her; her wrist was livid with the hold loosened\r\nby death. She felt struck by the plague; her aged frame was unable to\r\nbear her away with sufficient speed; and now, believing herself\r\ninfected, she no longer dreaded the association of others; but, as\r\nswiftly as she might, came to her grand-daughter, at Windsor Castle,\r\nthere to lament and die. The sight was horrible; still she clung to\r\nlife, and lamented her mischance with cries and hideous groans; while\r\nthe swift advance of the disease shewed, what proved to be the fact,\r\nthat she could not survive many hours.\r\n\r\nWhile I was directing that the necessary care should be taken of her,\r\nClara came in; she was trembling and pale; and, when I anxiously asked\r\nher the cause of her agitation, she threw herself into my arms weeping\r\nand exclaiming\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, dearest uncle, do not hate me for ever! I must\r\ntell you, for you must know, that Evelyn, poor little Evelyn\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94her voice\r\nwas choked by sobs. The fear of so mighty a calamity as the loss of our\r\nadored infant made the current of my blood pause with chilly horror;\r\nbut the remembrance of the mother restored my presence of mind. I\r\nsought the little bed of my darling; he was oppressed by fever; but I\r\ntrusted, I fondly and fearfully trusted, that there were no symptoms of\r\nthe plague. He was not three years old, and his illness appeared only\r\none of those attacks incident to infancy. I watched him long\xe2\x80\x94his heavy\r\nhalf-closed lids, his burning cheeks and restless twining of his small\r\nfingers\xe2\x80\x94the fever was violent, the torpor complete\xe2\x80\x94enough, without the\r\ngreater fear of pestilence, to awaken alarm. Idris must not see him in\r\nthis state. Clara, though only twelve years old, was rendered, through\r\nextreme sensibility, so prudent and careful, that I felt secure in\r\nentrusting the charge of him to her, and it was my task to prevent\r\nIdris from observing their absence. I administered the fitting\r\nremedies, and left my sweet niece to watch beside him, and bring me\r\nnotice of any change she should observe.\r\n\r\nI then went to Idris, contriving in my way, plausible excuses for\r\nremaining all day in the Castle, and endeavouring to disperse the\r\ntraces of care from my brow. Fortunately she was not alone. I found\r\nMerrival, the astronomer, with her. He was far too long sighted in his\r\nview of humanity to heed the casualties of the day, and lived in the\r\nmidst of contagion unconscious of its existence. This poor man, learned\r\nas La Place, guileless and unforeseeing as a child, had often been on\r\nthe point of starvation, he, his pale wife and numerous offspring,\r\nwhile he neither felt hunger, nor observed distress. His astronomical\r\ntheories absorbed him; calculations were scrawled with coal on the bare\r\nwalls of his garret: a hard-earned guinea, or an article of dress, was\r\nexchanged for a book without remorse; he neither heard his children\r\ncry, nor observed his companion\xe2\x80\x99s emaciated form, and the excess of\r\ncalamity was merely to him as the occurrence of a cloudy night, when he\r\nwould have given his right hand to observe a celestial phenomenon. His\r\nwife was one of those wondrous beings, to be found only among women,\r\nwith affections not to be diminished by misfortune. Her mind was\r\ndivided between boundless admiration for her husband, and tender\r\nanxiety for her children\xe2\x80\x94she waited on him, worked for them, and never\r\ncomplained, though care rendered her life one long-drawn, melancholy\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nHe had introduced himself to Adrian, by a request he made to observe\r\nsome planetary motions from his glass. His poverty was easily detected\r\nand relieved. He often thanked us for the books we lent him, and for\r\nthe use of our instruments, but never spoke of his altered abode or\r\nchange of circumstances. His wife assured us, that he had not observed\r\nany difference, except in the absence of the children from his study,\r\nand to her infinite surprise he complained of this unaccustomed quiet.\r\n\r\nHe came now to announce to us the completion of his Essay on the\r\nPericyclical Motions of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Axis, and the precession of the\r\nequinoctial points. If an old Roman of the period of the Republic had\r\nreturned to life, and talked of the impending election of some\r\nlaurel-crowned consul, or of the last battle with Mithridates, his\r\nideas would not have been more alien to the times, than the\r\nconversation of Merrival. Man, no longer with an appetite for sympathy,\r\nclothed his thoughts in visible signs; nor were there any readers left:\r\nwhile each one, having thrown away his sword with opposing shield\r\nalone, awaited the plague, Merrival talked of the state of mankind six\r\nthousand years hence. He might with equal interest to us, have added a\r\ncommentary, to describe the unknown and unimaginable lineaments of the\r\ncreatures, who would then occupy the vacated dwelling of mankind. We\r\nhad not the heart to undeceive the poor old man; and at the moment I\r\ncame in, he was reading parts of his book to Idris, asking what answer\r\ncould be given to this or that position.\r\n\r\nIdris could not refrain from a smile, as she listened; she had already\r\ngathered from him that his family was alive and in health; though not\r\napt to forget the precipice of time on which she stood, yet I could\r\nperceive that she was amused for a moment, by the contrast between the\r\ncontracted view we had so long taken of human life, and the seven\r\nleague strides with which Merrival paced a coming eternity. I was glad\r\nto see her smile, because it assured me of her total ignorance of her\r\ninfant\xe2\x80\x99s danger: but I shuddered to think of the revulsion that would\r\nbe occasioned by a discovery of the truth. While Merrival was talking,\r\nClara softly opened a door behind Idris, and beckoned me to come with a\r\ngesture and look of grief. A mirror betrayed the sign to Idris\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nstarted up. To suspect evil, to perceive that, Alfred being with us,\r\nthe danger must regard her youngest darling, to fly across the long\r\nchambers into his apartment, was the work but of a moment. There she\r\nbeheld her Evelyn lying fever-stricken and motionless. I followed her,\r\nand strove to inspire more hope than I could myself entertain; but she\r\nshook her head mournfully. Anguish deprived her of presence of mind;\r\nshe gave up to me and Clara the physician\xe2\x80\x99s and nurse\xe2\x80\x99s parts; she sat\r\nby the bed, holding one little burning hand, and, with glazed eyes\r\nfixed on her babe, passed the long day in one unvaried agony. It was\r\nnot the plague that visited our little boy so roughly; but she could\r\nnot listen to my assurances; apprehension deprived her of judgment and\r\nreflection; every slight convulsion of her child\xe2\x80\x99s features shook her\r\nframe \xe2\x80\x94if he moved, she dreaded the instant crisis; if he remained\r\nstill, she saw death in his torpor, and the cloud on her brow darkened.\r\n\r\nThe poor little thing\xe2\x80\x99s fever encreased towards night. The sensation is\r\nmost dreary, to use no stronger term, with which one looks forward to\r\npassing the long hours of night beside a sick bed, especially if the\r\npatient be an infant, who cannot explain its pain, and whose flickering\r\nlife resembles the wasting flame of the watch-light,\r\n\r\n        Whose narrow fire\r\nIs shaken by the wind, and on whose edge\r\nDevouring darkness hovers.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith eagerness one turns toward the east, with angry impatience one\r\nmarks the unchequered darkness; the crowing of a cock, that sound of\r\nglee during day-time, comes wailing and untuneable\xe2\x80\x94the creaking of\r\nrafters, and slight stir of invisible insect is heard and felt as the\r\nsignal and type of desolation. Clara, overcome by weariness, had seated\r\nherself at the foot of her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and in spite of her efforts\r\nslumber weighed down her lids; twice or thrice she shook it off; but at\r\nlength she was conquered and slept. Idris sat at the bedside, holding\r\nEvelyn\xe2\x80\x99s hand; we were afraid to speak to each other; I watched the\r\nstars \xe2\x80\x94I hung over my child\xe2\x80\x94I felt his little pulse\xe2\x80\x94I drew near the\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94again I receded. At the turn of morning a gentle sigh from the\r\npatient attracted me, the burning spot on his cheek faded\xe2\x80\x94his pulse\r\nbeat softly and regularly\xe2\x80\x94torpor yielded to sleep. For a long time I\r\ndared not hope; but when his unobstructed breathing and the moisture\r\nthat suffused his forehead, were tokens no longer to be mistaken of the\r\ndeparture of mortal malady, I ventured to whisper the news of the\r\nchange to Idris, and at length succeeded in persuading her that I spoke\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nBut neither this assurance, nor the speedy convalescence of our child\r\ncould restore her, even to the portion of peace she before enjoyed. Her\r\nfear had been too deep, too absorbing, too entire, to be changed to\r\nsecurity. She felt as if during her past calm she had dreamed, but was\r\nnow awake; she was\r\n\r\n        As one\r\nIn some lone watch-tower on the deep, awakened\r\nFrom soothing visions of the home he loves,\r\nTrembling to hear the wrathful billows roar;[15]\r\n\r\n\r\nas one who has been cradled by a storm, and awakes to find the vessel\r\nsinking. Before, she had been visited by pangs of fear\xe2\x80\x94now, she never\r\nenjoyed an interval of hope. No smile of the heart ever irradiated her\r\nfair countenance; sometimes she forced one, and then gushing tears\r\nwould flow, and the sea of grief close above these wrecks of past\r\nhappiness. Still while I was near her, she could not be in utter\r\ndespair\xe2\x80\x94 she fully confided herself to me\xe2\x80\x94she did not seem to fear my\r\ndeath, or revert to its possibility; to my guardianship she consigned\r\nthe full freight of her anxieties, reposing on my love, as a\r\nwind-nipped fawn by the side of a doe, as a wounded nestling under its\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s wing, as a tiny, shattered boat, quivering still, beneath some\r\nprotecting willow-tree. While I, not proudly as in days of joy, yet\r\ntenderly, and with glad consciousness of the comfort I afforded, drew\r\nmy trembling girl close to my heart, and tried to ward every painful\r\nthought or rough circumstance from her sensitive nature.\r\n\r\nOne other incident occurred at the end of this summer. The Countess of\r\nWindsor, Ex-Queen of England, returned from Germany. She had at the\r\nbeginning of the season quitted the vacant city of Vienna; and, unable\r\nto tame her haughty mind to anything like submission, she had delayed\r\nat Hamburgh, and, when at last she came to London, many weeks elapsed\r\nbefore she gave Adrian notice of her arrival. In spite of her coldness\r\nand long absence, he welcomed her with sensibility, displaying such\r\naffection as sought to heal the wounds of pride and sorrow, and was\r\nrepulsed only by her total apparent want of sympathy. Idris heard of\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s return with pleasure. Her own maternal feelings were so\r\nardent, that she imagined her parent must now, in this waste world,\r\nhave lost pride and harshness, and would receive with delight her\r\nfilial attentions. The first check to her duteous demonstrations was a\r\nformal intimation from the fallen majesty of England, that I was in no\r\nmanner to be intruded upon her. She consented, she said, to forgive her\r\ndaughter, and acknowledge her grandchildren; larger concessions must\r\nnot be expected.\r\n\r\nTo me this proceeding appeared (if so light a term may be permitted)\r\nextremely whimsical. Now that the race of man had lost in fact all\r\ndistinction of rank, this pride was doubly fatuitous; now that we felt\r\na kindred, fraternal nature with all who bore the stamp of humanity,\r\nthis angry reminiscence of times for ever gone, was worse than foolish.\r\nIdris was too much taken up by her own dreadful fears, to be angry,\r\nhardly grieved; for she judged that insensibility must be the source of\r\nthis continued rancour. This was not altogether the fact: but\r\npredominant self-will assumed the arms and masque of callous feeling;\r\nand the haughty lady disdained to exhibit any token of the struggle she\r\nendured; while the slave of pride, she fancied that she sacrificed her\r\nhappiness to immutable principle.\r\n\r\nFalse was all this\xe2\x80\x94false all but the affections of our nature, and the\r\nlinks of sympathy with pleasure or pain. There was but one good and one\r\nevil in the world\xe2\x80\x94life and death. The pomp of rank, the assumption of\r\npower, the possessions of wealth vanished like morning mist. One living\r\nbeggar had become of more worth than a national peerage of dead lords\xe2\x80\x94\r\nalas the day!\xe2\x80\x94than of dead heroes, patriots, or men of genius. There\r\nwas much of degradation in this: for even vice and virtue had lost\r\ntheir attributes\xe2\x80\x94life\xe2\x80\x94life\xe2\x80\x94the continuation of our animal mechanism\xe2\x80\x94\r\nwas the Alpha and Omega of the desires, the prayers, the prostrate\r\nambition of human race.\r\n\r\n [10] Calderon de la Barca.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] [2] Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n [12] Keats.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] Andrew Marvell.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] The Cenci\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] The Brides\xe2\x80\x99 Tragedy, by T. L. Beddoes, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf England was desolate, when October came, and the equinoctial winds\r\nswept over the earth, chilling the ardours of the unhealthy season. The\r\nsummer, which was uncommonly hot, had been protracted into the\r\nbeginning of this month, when on the eighteenth a sudden change was\r\nbrought about from summer temperature to winter frost. Pestilence then\r\nmade a pause in her death-dealing career. Gasping, not daring to name\r\nour hopes, yet full even to the brim with intense expectation, we\r\nstood, as a ship-wrecked sailor stands on a barren rock islanded by the\r\nocean, watching a distant vessel, fancying that now it nears, and then\r\nagain that it is bearing from sight. This promise of a renewed lease of\r\nlife turned rugged natures to melting tenderness, and by contrast\r\nfilled the soft with harsh and unnatural sentiments. When it seemed\r\ndestined that all were to die, we were reckless of the how and when\xe2\x80\x94now\r\nthat the virulence of the disease was mitigated, and it appeared\r\nwilling to spare some, each was eager to be among the elect, and clung\r\nto life with dastard tenacity. Instances of desertion became more\r\nfrequent; and even murders, which made the hearer sick with horror,\r\nwhere the fear of contagion had armed those nearest in blood against\r\neach other. But these smaller and separate tragedies were about to\r\nyield to a mightier interest\xe2\x80\x94and, while we were promised calm from\r\ninfectious influences, a tempest arose wilder than the winds, a tempest\r\nbred by the passions of man, nourished by his most violent impulses,\r\nunexampled and dire.\r\n\r\nA number of people from North America, the relics of that populous\r\ncontinent, had set sail for the East with mad desire of change, leaving\r\ntheir native plains for lands not less afflicted than their own.\r\nSeveral hundreds landed in Ireland, about the first of November, and\r\ntook possession of such vacant habitations as they could find; seizing\r\nupon the superabundant food, and the stray cattle. As they exhausted\r\nthe produce of one spot, they went on to another. At length they began\r\nto interfere with the inhabitants, and strong in their concentrated\r\nnumbers, ejected the natives from their dwellings, and robbed them of\r\ntheir winter store. A few events of this kind roused the fiery nature\r\nof the Irish; and they attacked the invaders. Some were destroyed; the\r\nmajor part escaped by quick and well ordered movements; and danger made\r\nthem careful. Their numbers ably arranged; the very deaths among them\r\nconcealed; moving on in good order, and apparently given up to\r\nenjoyment, they excited the envy of the Irish. The Americans permitted\r\na few to join their band, and presently the recruits outnumbered the\r\nstrangers\xe2\x80\x94nor did they join with them, nor imitate the admirable order\r\nwhich, preserved by the Trans-Atlantic chiefs, rendered them at once\r\nsecure and formidable. The Irish followed their track in disorganized\r\nmultitudes; each day encreasing; each day becoming more lawless. The\r\nAmericans were eager to escape from the spirit they had roused, and,\r\nreaching the eastern shores of the island, embarked for England. Their\r\nincursion would hardly have been felt had they come alone; but the\r\nIrish, collected in unnatural numbers, began to feel the inroads of\r\nfamine, and they followed in the wake of the Americans for England\r\nalso. The crossing of the sea could not arrest their progress. The\r\nharbours of the desolate sea-ports of the west of Ireland were filled\r\nwith vessels of all sizes, from the man of war to the small fishers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nboat, which lay sailorless, and rotting on the lazy deep. The emigrants\r\nembarked by hundreds, and unfurling their sails with rude hands, made\r\nstrange havoc of buoy and cordage. Those who modestly betook themselves\r\nto the smaller craft, for the most part achieved their watery journey\r\nin safety. Some, in the true spirit of reckless enterprise, went on\r\nboard a ship of an hundred and twenty guns; the vast hull drifted with\r\nthe tide out of the bay, and after many hours its crew of landsmen\r\ncontrived to spread a great part of her enormous canvass\xe2\x80\x94the wind took\r\nit, and while a thousand mistakes of the helmsman made her present her\r\nhead now to one point, and now to another, the vast fields of canvass\r\nthat formed her sails flapped with a sound like that of a huge\r\ncataract; or such as a sea-like forest may give forth when buffeted by\r\nan equinoctial north-wind. The port-holes were open, and with every\r\nsea, which as she lurched, washed her decks, they received whole tons\r\nof water. The difficulties were increased by a fresh breeze which began\r\nto blow, whistling among the shrowds, dashing the sails this way and\r\nthat, and rending them with horrid split, and such whir as may have\r\nvisited the dreams of Milton, when he imagined the winnowing of the\r\narch-fiend\xe2\x80\x99s van-like wings, which encreased the uproar of wild chaos.\r\nThese sounds were mingled with the roaring of the sea, the splash of\r\nthe chafed billows round the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s sides, and the gurgling up of the\r\nwater in the hold. The crew, many of whom had never seen the sea\r\nbefore, felt indeed as if heaven and earth came ruining together, as\r\nthe vessel dipped her bows in the waves, or rose high upon them. Their\r\nyells were drowned in the clamour of elements, and the thunder rivings\r\nof their unwieldy habitation\xe2\x80\x94they discovered at last that the water\r\ngained on them, and they betook themselves to their pumps; they might\r\nas well have laboured to empty the ocean by bucketfuls. As the sun went\r\ndown, the gale encreased; the ship seemed to feel her danger, she was\r\nnow completely water-logged, and presented other indications of\r\nsettling before she went down. The bay was crowded with vessels, whose\r\ncrews, for the most part, were observing the uncouth sportings of this\r\nhuge unwieldy machine\xe2\x80\x94they saw her gradually sink; the waters now\r\nrising above her lower decks\xe2\x80\x94they could hardly wink before she had\r\nutterly disappeared, nor could the place where the sea had closed over\r\nher be at all discerned. Some few of her crew were saved, but the\r\ngreater part clinging to her cordage and masts went down with her, to\r\nrise only when death loosened their hold.\r\n\r\nThis event caused many of those who were about to sail, to put foot\r\nagain on firm land, ready to encounter any evil rather than to rush\r\ninto the yawning jaws of the pitiless ocean. But these were few, in\r\ncomparison to the numbers who actually crossed. Many went up as high as\r\nBelfast to ensure a shorter passage, and then journeying south through\r\nScotland, they were joined by the poorer natives of that country, and\r\nall poured with one consent into England.\r\n\r\nSuch incursions struck the English with affright, in all those towns\r\nwhere there was still sufficient population to feel the change. There\r\nwas room enough indeed in our hapless country for twice the number of\r\ninvaders; but their lawless spirit instigated them to violence; they\r\ntook a delight in thrusting the possessors from their houses; in\r\nseizing on some mansion of luxury, where the noble dwellers secluded\r\nthemselves in fear of the plague; in forcing these of either sex to\r\nbecome their servants and purveyors; till, the ruin complete in one\r\nplace, they removed their locust visitation to another. When unopposed\r\nthey spread their ravages wide; in cases of danger they clustered, and\r\nby dint of numbers overthrew their weak and despairing foes. They came\r\nfrom the east and the north, and directed their course without apparent\r\nmotive, but unanimously towards our unhappy metropolis.\r\n\r\nCommunication had been to a great degree cut off through the paralyzing\r\neffects of pestilence, so that the van of our invaders had proceeded as\r\nfar as Manchester and Derby, before we received notice of their\r\narrival. They swept the country like a conquering army, burning\xe2\x80\x94laying\r\nwaste\xe2\x80\x94 murdering. The lower and vagabond English joined with them. Some\r\nfew of the Lords Lieutenant who remained, endeavoured to collect the\r\nmilitia\xe2\x80\x94but the ranks were vacant, panic seized on all, and the\r\nopposition that was made only served to increase the audacity and\r\ncruelty of the enemy. They talked of taking London, conquering\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x94calling to mind the long detail of injuries which had for many\r\nyears been forgotten. Such vaunts displayed their weakness, rather than\r\ntheir strength\xe2\x80\x94yet still they might do extreme mischief, which, ending\r\nin their destruction, would render them at last objects of compassion\r\nand remorse.\r\n\r\nWe were now taught how, in the beginning of the world, mankind clothed\r\ntheir enemies in impossible attributes\xe2\x80\x94and how details proceeding from\r\nmouth to mouth, might, like Virgil\xe2\x80\x99s ever-growing Rumour, reach the\r\nheavens with her brow, and clasp Hesperus and Lucifer with her\r\noutstretched hands. Gorgon and Centaur, dragon and iron-hoofed lion,\r\nvast sea-monster and gigantic hydra, were but types of the strange and\r\nappalling accounts brought to London concerning our invaders. Their\r\nlanding was long unknown, but having now advanced within an hundred\r\nmiles of London, the country people flying before them arrived in\r\nsuccessive troops, each exaggerating the numbers, fury, and cruelty of\r\nthe assailants. Tumult filled the before quiet streets\xe2\x80\x94women and\r\nchildren deserted their homes, escaping they knew not whither\xe2\x80\x94fathers,\r\nhusbands, and sons, stood trembling, not for themselves, but for their\r\nloved and defenceless relations. As the country people poured into\r\nLondon, the citizens fled southwards\xe2\x80\x94they climbed the higher edifices\r\nof the town, fancying that they could discern the smoke and flames the\r\nenemy spread around them. As Windsor lay, to a great degree, in the\r\nline of march from the west, I removed my family to London, assigning\r\nthe Tower for their sojourn, and joining Adrian, acted as his\r\nLieutenant in the coming struggle.\r\n\r\nWe employed only two days in our preparations, and made good use of\r\nthem. Artillery and arms were collected; the remnants of such\r\nregiments, as could be brought through many losses into any show of\r\nmuster, were put under arms, with that appearance of military\r\ndiscipline which might encourage our own party, and seem most\r\nformidable to the disorganized multitude of our enemies. Even music was\r\nnot wanting: banners floated in the air, and the shrill fife and loud\r\ntrumpet breathed forth sounds of encouragement and victory. A practised\r\near might trace an undue faltering in the step of the soldiers; but\r\nthis was not occasioned so much by fear of the adversary, as by\r\ndisease, by sorrow, and by fatal prognostications, which often weighed\r\nmost potently on the brave, and quelled the manly heart to abject\r\nsubjection.\r\n\r\nAdrian led the troops. He was full of care. It was small relief to him\r\nthat our discipline should gain us success in such a conflict; while\r\nplague still hovered to equalize the conqueror and the conquered, it\r\nwas not victory that he desired, but bloodless peace. As we advanced,\r\nwe were met by bands of peasantry, whose almost naked condition, whose\r\ndespair and horror, told at once the fierce nature of the coming enemy.\r\nThe senseless spirit of conquest and thirst of spoil blinded them,\r\nwhile with insane fury they deluged the country in ruin. The sight of\r\nthe military restored hope to those who fled, and revenge took place of\r\nfear. They inspired the soldiers with the same sentiment. Languor was\r\nchanged to ardour, the slow step converted to a speedy pace, while the\r\nhollow murmur of the multitude, inspired by one feeling, and that\r\ndeadly, filled the air, drowning the clang of arms and sound of music.\r\nAdrian perceived the change, and feared that it would be difficult to\r\nprevent them from wreaking their utmost fury on the Irish. He rode\r\nthrough the lines, charging the officers to restrain the troops,\r\nexhorting the soldiers, restoring order, and quieting in some degree\r\nthe violent agitation that swelled every bosom.\r\n\r\nWe first came upon a few stragglers of the Irish at St. Albans. They\r\nretreated, and, joining others of their companions, still fell back,\r\ntill they reached the main body. Tidings of an armed and regular\r\nopposition recalled them to a sort of order. They made Buckingham their\r\nhead-quarters, and scouts were sent out to ascertain our situation. We\r\nremained for the night at Luton. In the morning a simultaneous movement\r\ncaused us each to advance. It was early dawn, and the air, impregnated\r\nwith freshest odour, seemed in idle mockery to play with our banners,\r\nand bore onwards towards the enemy the music of the bands, the\r\nneighings of the horses, and regular step of the infantry. The first\r\nsound of martial instruments that came upon our undisciplined foe,\r\ninspired surprise, not unmingled with dread. It spoke of other days, of\r\ndays of concord and order; it was associated with times when plague was\r\nnot, and man lived beyond the shadow of imminent fate. The pause was\r\nmomentary. Soon we heard their disorderly clamour, the barbarian\r\nshouts, the untimed step of thousands coming on in disarray. Their\r\ntroops now came pouring on us from the open country or narrow lanes; a\r\nlarge extent of unenclosed fields lay between us; we advanced to the\r\nmiddle of this, and then made a halt: being somewhat on superior\r\nground, we could discern the space they covered. When their leaders\r\nperceived us drawn out in opposition, they also gave the word to halt,\r\nand endeavoured to form their men into some imitation of military\r\ndiscipline. The first ranks had muskets; some were mounted, but their\r\narms were such as they had seized during their advance, their horses\r\nthose they had taken from the peasantry; there was no uniformity, and\r\nlittle obedience, but their shouts and wild gestures showed the untamed\r\nspirit that inspired them. Our soldiers received the word, and advanced\r\nto quickest time, but in perfect order: their uniform dresses, the\r\ngleam of their polished arms, their silence, and looks of sullen hate,\r\nwere more appalling than the savage clamour of our innumerous foe. Thus\r\ncoming nearer and nearer each other, the howls and shouts of the Irish\r\nincreased; the English proceeded in obedience to their officers, until\r\nthey came near enough to distinguish the faces of their enemies; the\r\nsight inspired them with fury: with one cry, that rent heaven and was\r\nre-echoed by the furthest lines, they rushed on; they disdained the use\r\nof the bullet, but with fixed bayonet dashed among the opposing foe,\r\nwhile the ranks opening at intervals, the matchmen lighted the cannon,\r\nwhose deafening roar and blinding smoke filled up the horror of the\r\nscene. I was beside Adrian; a moment before he had again given the word\r\nto halt, and had remained a few yards distant from us in deep\r\nmeditation: he was forming swiftly his plan of action, to prevent the\r\neffusion of blood; the noise of cannon, the sudden rush of the troops,\r\nand yell of the foe, startled him: with flashing eyes he exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one of these must perish!\xe2\x80\x9d and plunging the rowels into his\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s sides, he dashed between the conflicting bands. We, his staff,\r\nfollowed him to surround and protect him; obeying his signal, however,\r\nwe fell back somewhat. The soldiery perceiving him, paused in their\r\nonset; he did not swerve from the bullets that passed near him, but\r\nrode immediately between the opposing lines. Silence succeeded to\r\nclamour; about fifty men lay on the ground dying or dead. Adrian raised\r\nhis sword in act to speak: \xe2\x80\x9cBy whose command,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, addressing his\r\nown troops, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you advance? Who ordered your attack? Fall back; these\r\nmisguided men shall not be slaughtered, while I am your general. Sheath\r\nyour weapons; these are your brothers, commit not fratricide; soon the\r\nplague will not leave one for you to glut your revenge upon: will you\r\nbe more pitiless than pestilence? As you honour me\xe2\x80\x94as you worship God,\r\nin whose image those also are created\xe2\x80\x94as your children and friends are\r\ndear to you,\xe2\x80\x94shed not a drop of precious human blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with outstretched hand and winning voice, and then turning to\r\nour invaders, with a severe brow, he commanded them to lay down their\r\narms: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat because we are wasted by plague,\r\nyou can overcome us; the plague is also among you, and when ye are\r\nvanquished by famine and disease, the ghosts of those you have murdered\r\nwill arise to bid you not hope in death. Lay down your arms, barbarous\r\nand cruel men\xe2\x80\x94men whose hands are stained with the blood of the\r\ninnocent, whose souls are weighed down by the orphan\xe2\x80\x99s cry! We shall\r\nconquer, for the right is on our side; already your cheeks are pale\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nweapons fall from your nerveless grasp. Lay down your arms, fellow men!\r\nbrethren! Pardon, succour, and brotherly love await your repentance.\r\nYou are dear to us, because you wear the frail shape of humanity; each\r\none among you will find a friend and host among these forces. Shall man\r\nbe the enemy of man, while plague, the foe to all, even now is above\r\nus, triumphing in our butchery, more cruel than her own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach army paused. On our side the soldiers grasped their arms firmly,\r\nand looked with stern glances on the foe. These had not thrown down\r\ntheir weapons, more from fear than the spirit of contest; they looked\r\nat each other, each wishing to follow some example given him,\xe2\x80\x94but they\r\nhad no leader. Adrian threw himself from his horse, and approaching one\r\nof those just slain: \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a man,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand he is dead. O\r\nquickly bind up the wounds of the fallen\xe2\x80\x94let not one die; let not one\r\nmore soul escape through your merciless gashes, to relate before the\r\nthrone of God the tale of fratricide; bind up their wounds\xe2\x80\x94restore them\r\nto their friends. Cast away the hearts of tigers that burn in your\r\nbreasts; throw down those tools of cruelty and hate; in this pause of\r\nexterminating destiny, let each man be brother, guardian, and stay to\r\nthe other. Away with those blood-stained arms, and hasten some of you\r\nto bind up these wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he knelt on the ground, and raised in his arms a man from\r\nwhose side the warm tide of life gushed\xe2\x80\x94the poor wretch gasped\xe2\x80\x94so still\r\nhad either host become, that his moans were distinctly heard, and every\r\nheart, late fiercely bent on universal massacre, now beat anxiously in\r\nhope and fear for the fate of this one man. Adrian tore off his\r\nmilitary scarf and bound it round the sufferer\xe2\x80\x94it was too late\xe2\x80\x94the man\r\nheaved a deep sigh, his head fell back, his limbs lost their sustaining\r\npower.\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cHe is dead!\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, as the corpse fell from his arms on\r\nthe ground, and he bowed his head in sorrow and awe. The fate of the\r\nworld seemed bound up in the death of this single man. On either side\r\nthe bands threw down their arms, even the veterans wept, and our party\r\nheld out their hands to their foes, while a gush of love and deepest\r\namity filled every heart. The two forces mingling, unarmed and hand in\r\nhand, talking only how each might assist the other, the adversaries\r\nconjoined; each repenting, the one side their former cruelties, the\r\nother their late violence, they obeyed the orders of the General to\r\nproceed towards London.\r\n\r\nAdrian was obliged to exert his utmost prudence, first to allay the\r\ndiscord, and then to provide for the multitude of the invaders. They\r\nwere marched to various parts of the southern counties, quartered in\r\ndeserted villages,\xe2\x80\x94a part were sent back to their own island, while the\r\nseason of winter so far revived our energy, that the passes of the\r\ncountry were defended, and any increase of numbers prohibited.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Adrian and Idris met after a separation of nearly a\r\nyear. Adrian had been occupied in fulfilling a laborious and painful\r\ntask. He had been familiar with every species of human misery, and had\r\nfor ever found his powers inadequate, his aid of small avail. Yet the\r\npurpose of his soul, his energy and ardent resolution, prevented any\r\nre-action of sorrow. He seemed born anew, and virtue, more potent than\r\nMedean alchemy, endued him with health and strength. Idris hardly\r\nrecognized the fragile being, whose form had seemed to bend even to the\r\nsummer breeze, in the energetic man, whose very excess of sensibility\r\nrendered him more capable of fulfilling his station of pilot in\r\nstorm-tossed England.\r\n\r\nIt was not thus with Idris. She was uncomplaining; but the very soul of\r\nfear had taken its seat in her heart. She had grown thin and pale, her\r\neyes filled with involuntary tears, her voice was broken and low. She\r\ntried to throw a veil over the change which she knew her brother must\r\nobserve in her, but the effort was ineffectual; and when alone with\r\nhim, with a burst of irrepressible grief she gave vent to her\r\napprehensions and sorrow. She described in vivid terms the ceaseless\r\ncare that with still renewing hunger ate into her soul; she compared\r\nthis gnawing of sleepless expectation of evil, to the vulture that fed\r\non the heart of Prometheus; under the influence of this eternal\r\nexcitement, and of the interminable struggles she endured to combat and\r\nconceal it, she felt, she said, as if all the wheels and springs of the\r\nanimal machine worked at double rate, and were fast consuming\r\nthemselves. Sleep was not sleep, for her waking thoughts, bridled by\r\nsome remains of reason, and by the sight of her children happy and in\r\nhealth, were then transformed to wild dreams, all her terrors were\r\nrealized, all her fears received their dread fulfilment. To this state\r\nthere was no hope, no alleviation, unless the grave should quickly\r\nreceive its destined prey, and she be permitted to die, before she\r\nexperienced a thousand living deaths in the loss of those she loved.\r\nFearing to give me pain, she hid as best she could the excess of her\r\nwretchedness, but meeting thus her brother after a long absence, she\r\ncould not restrain the expression of her woe, but with all the\r\nvividness of imagination with which misery is always replete, she\r\npoured out the emotions of her heart to her beloved and sympathizing\r\nAdrian.\r\n\r\nHer present visit to London tended to augment her state of inquietude,\r\nby shewing in its utmost extent the ravages occasioned by pestilence.\r\nIt hardly preserved the appearance of an inhabited city; grass sprung\r\nup thick in the streets; the squares were weed-grown, the houses were\r\nshut up, while silence and loneliness characterized the busiest parts\r\nof the town. Yet in the midst of desolation Adrian had preserved order;\r\nand each one continued to live according to law and custom\xe2\x80\x94human\r\ninstitutions thus surviving as it were divine ones, and while the\r\ndecree of population was abrogated, property continued sacred. It was a\r\nmelancholy reflection; and in spite of the diminution of evil produced,\r\nit struck on the heart as a wretched mockery. All idea of resort for\r\npleasure, of theatres and festivals had passed away. \xe2\x80\x9cNext summer,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Adrian as we parted on our return to Windsor, \xe2\x80\x9cwill decide the\r\nfate of the human race. I shall not pause in my exertions until that\r\ntime; but, if plague revives with the coming year, all contest with her\r\nmust cease, and our only occupation be the choice of a grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI must not forget one incident that occurred during this visit to\r\nLondon. The visits of Merrival to Windsor, before frequent, had\r\nsuddenly ceased. At this time where but a hair\xe2\x80\x99s line separated the\r\nliving from the dead, I feared that our friend had become a victim to\r\nthe all-embracing evil. On this occasion I went, dreading the worst, to\r\nhis dwelling, to see if I could be of any service to those of his\r\nfamily who might have survived. The house was deserted, and had been\r\none of those assigned to the invading strangers quartered in London. I\r\nsaw his astronomical instruments put to strange uses, his globes\r\ndefaced, his papers covered with abstruse calculations destroyed. The\r\nneighbours could tell me little, till I lighted on a poor woman who\r\nacted as nurse in these perilous times. She told me that all the family\r\nwere dead, except Merrival himself, who had gone mad\xe2\x80\x94 mad, she called\r\nit, yet on questioning her further, it appeared that he was possessed\r\nonly by the delirium of excessive grief. This old man, tottering on the\r\nedge of the grave, and prolonging his prospect through millions of\r\ncalculated years,\xe2\x80\x94this visionary who had not seen starvation in the\r\nwasted forms of his wife and children, or plague in the horrible sights\r\nand sounds that surrounded him\xe2\x80\x94this astronomer, apparently dead on\r\nearth, and living only in the motion of the spheres\xe2\x80\x94loved his family\r\nwith unapparent but intense affection. Through long habit they had\r\nbecome a part of himself; his want of worldly knowledge, his absence of\r\nmind and infant guilelessness, made him utterly dependent on them. It\r\nwas not till one of them died that he perceived their danger; one by\r\none they were carried off by pestilence; and his wife, his helpmate and\r\nsupporter, more necessary to him than his own limbs and frame, which\r\nhad hardly been taught the lesson of self-preservation, the kind\r\ncompanion whose voice always spoke peace to him, closed her eyes in\r\ndeath. The old man felt the system of universal nature which he had so\r\nlong studied and adored, slide from under him, and he stood among the\r\ndead, and lifted his voice in curses.\xe2\x80\x94No wonder that the attendant\r\nshould interpret as phrensy the harrowing maledictions of the\r\ngrief-struck old man.\r\n\r\nI had commenced my search late in the day, a November day, that closed\r\nin early with pattering rain and melancholy wind. As I turned from the\r\ndoor, I saw Merrival, or rather the shadow of Merrival, attenuated and\r\nwild, pass me, and sit on the steps of his home. The breeze scattered\r\nthe grey locks on his temples, the rain drenched his uncovered head, he\r\nsat hiding his face in his withered hands. I pressed his shoulder to\r\nawaken his attention, but he did not alter his position. \xe2\x80\x9cMerrival,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cit is long since we have seen you\xe2\x80\x94you must return to Windsor\r\nwith me\xe2\x80\x94Lady Idris desires to see you, you will not refuse her\r\nrequest\xe2\x80\x94come home with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe replied in a hollow voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy deceive a helpless old man, why talk\r\nhypocritically to one half crazed? Windsor is not my home; my true home\r\nI have found; the home that the Creator has prepared for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis accent of bitter scorn thrilled me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo not tempt me to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cmy words would scare you\xe2\x80\x94in an universe of cowards I dare\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94among the church-yard tombs\xe2\x80\x94among the victims of His merciless\r\ntyranny I dare reproach the Supreme Evil. How can he punish me? Let him\r\nbare his arm and transfix me with lightning\xe2\x80\x94this is also one of his\r\nattributes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the old man laughed.\r\n\r\nHe rose, and I followed him through the rain to a neighbouring\r\nchurch-yard \xe2\x80\x94he threw himself on the wet earth. \xe2\x80\x9cHere they are,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful creatures\xe2\x80\x94breathing, speaking, loving creatures. She\r\nwho by day and night cherished the age-worn lover of her youth\xe2\x80\x94they,\r\nparts of my flesh, my children\xe2\x80\x94here they are: call them, scream their\r\nnames through the night; they will not answer!\xe2\x80\x9d He clung to the little\r\nheaps that marked the graves. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask but one thing; I do not fear His\r\nhell, for I have it here; I do not desire His heaven, let me but die\r\nand be laid beside them; let me but, when I lie dead, feel my flesh as\r\nit moulders, mingle with theirs. Promise,\xe2\x80\x9d and he raised himself\r\npainfully, and seized my arm, \xe2\x80\x9cpromise to bury me with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo God help me and mine as I promise,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9con one condition:\r\nreturn with me to Windsor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Windsor!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried with a shriek, \xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x94from this place I never\r\ngo \xe2\x80\x94my bones, my flesh, I myself, are already buried here, and what you\r\nsee of me is corrupted clay like them. I will lie here, and cling here,\r\ntill rain, and hail, and lightning and storm, ruining on me, make me\r\none in substance with them below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few words I must conclude this tragedy. I was obliged to leave\r\nLondon, and Adrian undertook to watch over him; the task was soon\r\nfulfilled; age, grief, and inclement weather, all united to hush his\r\nsorrows, and bring repose to his heart, whose beats were agony. He died\r\nembracing the sod, which was piled above his breast, when he was placed\r\nbeside the beings whom he regretted with such wild despair.\r\n\r\nI returned to Windsor at the wish of Idris, who seemed to think that\r\nthere was greater safety for her children at that spot; and because,\r\nonce having taken on me the guardianship of the district, I would not\r\ndesert it while an inhabitant survived. I went also to act in\r\nconformity with Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s plans, which was to congregate in masses what\r\nremained of the population; for he possessed the conviction that it was\r\nonly through the benevolent and social virtues that any safety was to\r\nbe hoped for the remnant of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt was a melancholy thing to return to this spot so dear to us, as the\r\nscene of a happiness rarely before enjoyed, here to mark the extinction\r\nof our species, and trace the deep uneraseable footsteps of disease\r\nover the fertile and cherished soil. The aspect of the country had so\r\nfar changed, that it had been impossible to enter on the task of sowing\r\nseed, and other autumnal labours. That season was now gone; and winter\r\nhad set in with sudden and unusual severity. Alternate frosts and thaws\r\nsucceeding to floods, rendered the country impassable. Heavy falls of\r\nsnow gave an arctic appearance to the scenery; the roofs of the houses\r\npeeped from the white mass; the lowly cot and stately mansion, alike\r\ndeserted, were blocked up, their thresholds uncleared; the windows were\r\nbroken by the hail, while the prevalence of a north-east wind rendered\r\nout-door exertions extremely painful. The altered state of society made\r\nthese accidents of nature, sources of real misery. The luxury of\r\ncommand and the attentions of servitude were lost. It is true that the\r\nnecessaries of life were assembled in such quantities, as to supply to\r\nsuperfluity the wants of the diminished population; but still much\r\nlabour was required to arrange these, as it were, raw materials; and\r\ndepressed by sickness, and fearful of the future, we had not energy to\r\nenter boldly and decidedly on any system.\r\n\r\nI can speak for myself\xe2\x80\x94want of energy was not my failing. The intense\r\nlife that quickened my pulses, and animated my frame, had the effect,\r\nnot of drawing me into the mazes of active life, but of exalting my\r\nlowliness, and of bestowing majestic proportions on insignificant\r\nobjects\xe2\x80\x94I could have lived the life of a peasant in the same way\xe2\x80\x94my\r\ntrifling occupations were swelled into important pursuits; my\r\naffections were impetuous and engrossing passions, and nature with all\r\nher changes was invested in divine attributes. The very spirit of the\r\nGreek mythology inhabited my heart; I deified the uplands, glades, and\r\nstreams, I\r\n\r\nHad sight of Proteus coming from the sea;\r\nAnd heard old Triton blow his wreathed horn.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange, that while the earth preserved her monotonous course, I dwelt\r\nwith ever-renewing wonder on her antique laws, and now that with\r\nexcentric wheel she rushed into an untried path, I should feel this\r\nspirit fade; I struggled with despondency and weariness, but like a\r\nfog, they choked me. Perhaps, after the labours and stupendous\r\nexcitement of the past summer, the calm of winter and the almost menial\r\ntoils it brought with it, were by natural re-action doubly irksome. It\r\nwas not the grasping passion of the preceding year, which gave life and\r\nindividuality to each moment\xe2\x80\x94it was not the aching pangs induced by the\r\ndistresses of the times. The utter inutility that had attended all my\r\nexertions took from them their usual effects of exhilaration, and\r\ndespair rendered abortive the balm of self applause\xe2\x80\x94I longed to return\r\nto my old occupations, but of what use were they? To read were\r\nfutile\xe2\x80\x94to write, vanity indeed. The earth, late wide circus for the\r\ndisplay of dignified exploits, vast theatre for a magnificent drama,\r\nnow presented a vacant space, an empty stage\xe2\x80\x94for actor or spectator\r\nthere was no longer aught to say or hear.\r\n\r\nOur little town of Windsor, in which the survivors from the\r\nneighbouring counties were chiefly assembled, wore a melancholy aspect.\r\nIts streets were blocked up with snow\xe2\x80\x94the few passengers seemed\r\npalsied, and frozen by the ungenial visitation of winter. To escape\r\nthese evils was the aim and scope of all our exertions. Families late\r\ndevoted to exalting and refined pursuits, rich, blooming, and young,\r\nwith diminished numbers and care-fraught hearts, huddled over a fire,\r\ngrown selfish and grovelling through suffering. Without the aid of\r\nservants, it was necessary to discharge all household duties; hands\r\nunused to such labour must knead the bread, or in the absence of flour,\r\nthe statesmen or perfumed courtier must undertake the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\nPoor and rich were now equal, or rather the poor were the superior,\r\nsince they entered on such tasks with alacrity and experience; while\r\nignorance, inaptitude, and habits of repose, rendered them fatiguing to\r\nthe luxurious, galling to the proud, disgustful to all whose minds,\r\nbent on intellectual improvement, held it their dearest privilege to be\r\nexempt from attending to mere animal wants.\r\n\r\nBut in every change goodness and affection can find field for exertion\r\nand display. Among some these changes produced a devotion and sacrifice\r\nof self at once graceful and heroic. It was a sight for the lovers of\r\nthe human race to enjoy; to behold, as in ancient times, the\r\npatriarchal modes in which the variety of kindred and friendship\r\nfulfilled their duteous and kindly offices. Youths, nobles of the land,\r\nperformed for the sake of mother or sister, the services of menials\r\nwith amiable cheerfulness. They went to the river to break the ice, and\r\ndraw water: they assembled on foraging expeditions, or axe in hand\r\nfelled the trees for fuel. The females received them on their return\r\nwith the simple and affectionate welcome known before only to the lowly\r\ncottage\xe2\x80\x94a clean hearth and bright fire; the supper ready cooked by\r\nbeloved hands; gratitude for the provision for to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s meal:\r\nstrange enjoyments for the high-born English, yet they were now their\r\nsole, hard earned, and dearly prized luxuries.\r\n\r\nNone was more conspicuous for this graceful submission to\r\ncircumstances, noble humility, and ingenious fancy to adorn such acts\r\nwith romantic colouring, than our own Clara. She saw my despondency,\r\nand the aching cares of Idris. Her perpetual study was to relieve us\r\nfrom labour and to spread ease and even elegance over our altered mode\r\nof life. We still had some attendants spared by disease, and warmly\r\nattached to us. But Clara was jealous of their services; she would be\r\nsole handmaid of Idris, sole minister to the wants of her little\r\ncousins; nothing gave her so much pleasure as our employing her in this\r\nway; she went beyond our desires, earnest, diligent, and unwearied,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAbra was ready ere we called her name,\r\nAnd though we called another, Abra came.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was my task each day to visit the various families assembled in our\r\ntown, and when the weather permitted, I was glad to prolong my ride,\r\nand to muse in solitude over every changeful appearance of our destiny,\r\nendeavouring to gather lessons for the future from the experience of\r\nthe past. The impatience with which, while in society, the ills that\r\nafflicted my species inspired me, were softened by loneliness, when\r\nindividual suffering was merged in the general calamity, strange to\r\nsay, less afflicting to contemplate. Thus often, pushing my way with\r\ndifficulty through the narrow snow-blocked town, I crossed the bridge\r\nand passed through Eton. No youthful congregation of gallant-hearted\r\nboys thronged the portal of the college; sad silence pervaded the busy\r\nschool-room and noisy playground. I extended my ride towards Salt Hill,\r\non every side impeded by the snow. Were those the fertile fields I\r\nloved\xe2\x80\x94was that the interchange of gentle upland and cultivated dale,\r\nonce covered with waving corn, diversified by stately trees, watered by\r\nthe meandering Thames? One sheet of white covered it, while bitter\r\nrecollection told me that cold as the winter-clothed earth, were the\r\nhearts of the inhabitants. I met troops of horses, herds of cattle,\r\nflocks of sheep, wandering at will; here throwing down a hay-rick, and\r\nnestling from cold in its heart, which afforded them shelter and\r\nfood\xe2\x80\x94there having taken possession of a vacant cottage. Once on a\r\nfrosty day, pushed on by restless unsatisfying reflections, I sought a\r\nfavourite haunt, a little wood not far distant from Salt Hill. A\r\nbubbling spring prattles over stones on one side, and a plantation of a\r\nfew elms and beeches, hardly deserve, and yet continue the name of\r\nwood. This spot had for me peculiar charms. It had been a favourite\r\nresort of Adrian; it was secluded; and he often said that in boyhood,\r\nhis happiest hours were spent here; having escaped the stately bondage\r\nof his mother, he sat on the rough hewn steps that led to the spring,\r\nnow reading a favourite book, now musing, with speculation beyond his\r\nyears, on the still unravelled skein of morals or metaphysics. A\r\nmelancholy foreboding assured me that I should never see this place\r\nmore; so with careful thought, I noted each tree, every winding of the\r\nstreamlet and irregularity of the soil, that I might better call up its\r\nidea in absence. A robin red-breast dropt from the frosty branches of\r\nthe trees, upon the congealed rivulet; its panting breast and\r\nhalf-closed eyes shewed that it was dying: a hawk appeared in the air;\r\nsudden fear seized the little creature; it exerted its last strength,\r\nthrowing itself on its back, raising its talons in impotent defence\r\nagainst its powerful enemy. I took it up and placed it in my breast. I\r\nfed it with a few crumbs from a biscuit; by degrees it revived; its\r\nwarm fluttering heart beat against me; I cannot tell why I detail this\r\ntrifling incident\xe2\x80\x94but the scene is still before me; the snow-clad\r\nfields seen through the silvered trunks of the beeches,\xe2\x80\x94the brook, in\r\ndays of happiness alive with sparkling waters, now choked by ice\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nleafless trees fantastically dressed in hoar frost\xe2\x80\x94the shapes of summer\r\nleaves imaged by winter\xe2\x80\x99s frozen hand on the hard ground\xe2\x80\x94the dusky sky,\r\ndrear cold, and unbroken silence\xe2\x80\x94while close in my bosom, my feathered\r\nnursling lay warm, and safe, speaking its content with a light chirp\xe2\x80\x94\r\npainful reflections thronged, stirring my brain with wild\r\ncommotion\xe2\x80\x94cold and death-like as the snowy fields was all\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x94misery-stricken the life-tide of the inhabitants\xe2\x80\x94why should I\r\noppose the cataract of destruction that swept us away?\xe2\x80\x94why string my\r\nnerves and renew my wearied efforts\xe2\x80\x94ah, why? But that my firm courage\r\nand cheerful exertions might shelter the dear mate, whom I chose in the\r\nspring of my life; though the throbbings of my heart be replete with\r\npain, though my hopes for the future are chill, still while your dear\r\nhead, my gentlest love, can repose in peace on that heart, and while\r\nyou derive from its fostering care, comfort, and hope, my struggles\r\nshall not cease,\xe2\x80\x94I will not call myself altogether vanquished.\r\n\r\nOne fine February day, when the sun had reassumed some of its genial\r\npower, I walked in the forest with my family. It was one of those\r\nlovely winter-days which assert the capacity of nature to bestow beauty\r\non barrenness. The leafless trees spread their fibrous branches against\r\nthe pure sky; their intricate and pervious tracery resembled delicate\r\nsea-weed; the deer were turning up the snow in search of the hidden\r\ngrass; the white was made intensely dazzling by the sun, and trunks of\r\nthe trees, rendered more conspicuous by the loss of preponderating\r\nfoliage, gathered around like the labyrinthine columns of a vast\r\ntemple; it was impossible not to receive pleasure from the sight of\r\nthese things. Our children, freed from the bondage of winter, bounded\r\nbefore us; pursuing the deer, or rousing the pheasants and partridges\r\nfrom their coverts. Idris leant on my arm; her sadness yielded to the\r\npresent sense of pleasure. We met other families on the Long Walk,\r\nenjoying like ourselves the return of the genial season. At once, I\r\nseemed to awake; I cast off the clinging sloth of the past months;\r\nearth assumed a new appearance, and my view of the future was suddenly\r\nmade clear. I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI have now found out the secret!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn answer to this question, I described our gloomy winter-life, our\r\nsordid cares, our menial labours:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThis northern country,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nno place for our diminished race. When mankind were few, it was not\r\nhere that they battled with the powerful agents of nature, and were\r\nenabled to cover the globe with offspring. We must seek some natural\r\nParadise, some garden of the earth, where our simple wants may be\r\neasily supplied, and the enjoyment of a delicious climate compensate\r\nfor the social pleasures we have lost. If we survive this coming\r\nsummer, I will not spend the ensuing winter in England; neither I nor\r\nany of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI spoke without much heed, and the very conclusion of what I said\r\nbrought with it other thoughts. Should we, any of us, survive the\r\ncoming summer? I saw the brow of Idris clouded; I again felt, that we\r\nwere enchained to the car of fate, over whose coursers we had no\r\ncontrol. We could no longer say, This we will do, and this we will\r\nleave undone. A mightier power than the human was at hand to destroy\r\nour plans or to achieve the work we avoided. It were madness to\r\ncalculate upon another winter. This was our last. The coming summer was\r\nthe extreme end of our vista; and, when we arrived there, instead of a\r\ncontinuation of the long road, a gulph yawned, into which we must of\r\nforce be precipitated. The last blessing of humanity was wrested from\r\nus; we might no longer hope. Can the madman, as he clanks his chains,\r\nhope? Can the wretch, led to the scaffold, who when he lays his head on\r\nthe block, marks the double shadow of himself and the executioner,\r\nwhose uplifted arm bears the axe, hope? Can the ship-wrecked mariner,\r\nwho spent with swimming, hears close behind the splashing waters\r\ndivided by a shark which pursues him through the Atlantic, hope? Such\r\nhope as theirs, we also may entertain!\r\n\r\nOld fable tells us, that this gentle spirit sprung from the box of\r\nPandora, else crammed with evils; but these were unseen and null, while\r\nall admired the inspiriting loveliness of young Hope; each man\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nbecame her home; she was enthroned sovereign of our lives, here and\r\nhere-after; she was deified and worshipped, declared incorruptible and\r\neverlasting. But like all other gifts of the Creator to Man, she is\r\nmortal; her life has attained its last hour. We have watched over her;\r\nnursed her flickering existence; now she has fallen at once from youth\r\nto decrepitude, from health to immedicinable disease; even as we spend\r\nourselves in struggles for her recovery, she dies; to all nations the\r\nvoice goes forth, Hope is dead! We are but mourners in the funeral\r\ntrain, and what immortal essence or perishable creation will refuse to\r\nmake one in the sad procession that attends to its grave the dead\r\ncomforter of humanity?\r\n\r\nDoes not the sun call in his light? and day\r\nLike a thin exhalation melt away\xe2\x80\x94\r\nBoth wrapping up their beams in clouds to be\r\nThemselves close mourners at this obsequie.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n [16] Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] Prior\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSolomon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n [18] Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Poems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOL. III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nHear you not the rushing sound of the coming tempest? Do you not behold\r\nthe clouds open, and destruction lurid and dire pour down on the\r\nblasted earth? See you not the thunderbolt fall, and are deafened by\r\nthe shout of heaven that follows its descent? Feel you not the earth\r\nquake and open with agonizing groans, while the air is pregnant with\r\nshrieks and wailings,\xe2\x80\x94 all announcing the last days of man? No! none of\r\nthese things accompanied our fall! The balmy air of spring, breathed\r\nfrom nature\xe2\x80\x99s ambrosial home, invested the lovely earth, which wakened\r\nas a young mother about to lead forth in pride her beauteous offspring\r\nto meet their sire who had been long absent. The buds decked the trees,\r\nthe flowers adorned the land: the dark branches, swollen with\r\nseasonable juices, expanded into leaves, and the variegated foliage of\r\nspring, bending and singing in the breeze, rejoiced in the genial\r\nwarmth of the unclouded empyrean: the brooks flowed murmuring, the sea\r\nwas waveless, and the promontories that over-hung it were reflected in\r\nthe placid waters; birds awoke in the woods, while abundant food for\r\nman and beast sprung up from the dark ground. Where was pain and evil?\r\nNot in the calm air or weltering ocean; not in the woods or fertile\r\nfields, nor among the birds that made the woods resonant with song, nor\r\nthe animals that in the midst of plenty basked in the sunshine. Our\r\nenemy, like the Calamity of Homer, trod our hearts, and no sound was\r\nechoed from her steps\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWith ills the land is rife, with ills the sea,\r\nDiseases haunt our frail humanity,\r\nThrough noon, through night, on casual wing they glide,\r\nSilent,\xe2\x80\x94a voice the power all-wise denied.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce man was a favourite of the Creator, as the royal psalmist sang,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod had made him a little lower than the angels, and had crowned him\r\nwith glory and honour. God made him to have dominion over the works of\r\nhis hands, and put all things under his feet.\xe2\x80\x9d Once it was so; now is\r\nman lord of the creation? Look at him\xe2\x80\x94ha! I see plague! She has\r\ninvested his form, is incarnate in his flesh, has entwined herself with\r\nhis being, and blinds his heaven-seeking eyes. Lie down, O man, on the\r\nflower-strown earth; give up all claim to your inheritance, all you can\r\never possess of it is the small cell which the dead require. Plague is\r\nthe companion of spring, of sunshine, and plenty. We no longer struggle\r\nwith her. We have forgotten what we did when she was not. Of old navies\r\nused to stem the giant ocean-waves betwixt Indus and the Pole for\r\nslight articles of luxury. Men made perilous journies to possess\r\nthemselves of earth\xe2\x80\x99s splendid trifles, gems and gold. Human labour was\r\nwasted\xe2\x80\x94human life set at nought. Now life is all that we covet; that\r\nthis automaton of flesh should, with joints and springs in order,\r\nperform its functions, that this dwelling of the soul should be capable\r\nof containing its dweller. Our minds, late spread abroad through\r\ncountless spheres and endless combinations of thought, now retrenched\r\nthemselves behind this wall of flesh, eager to preserve its well-being\r\nonly. We were surely sufficiently degraded.\r\n\r\nAt first the increase of sickness in spring brought increase of toil to\r\nsuch of us, who, as yet spared to life, bestowed our time and thoughts\r\non our fellow creatures. We nerved ourselves to the task: \xe2\x80\x9cin the midst\r\nof despair we performed the tasks of hope.\xe2\x80\x9d We went out with the\r\nresolution of disputing with our foe. We aided the sick, and comforted\r\nthe sorrowing; turning from the multitudinous dead to the rare\r\nsurvivors, with an energy of desire that bore the resemblance of power,\r\nwe bade them\xe2\x80\x94live. Plague sat paramount the while, and laughed us to\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\nHave any of you, my readers, observed the ruins of an anthill\r\nimmediately after its destruction? At first it appears entirely\r\ndeserted of its former inhabitants; in a little time you see an ant\r\nstruggling through the upturned mould; they reappear by twos and\r\nthrees, running hither and thither in search of their lost companions.\r\nSuch were we upon earth, wondering aghast at the effects of pestilence.\r\nOur empty habitations remained, but the dwellers were gathered to the\r\nshades of the tomb.\r\n\r\nAs the rules of order and pressure of laws were lost, some began with\r\nhesitation and wonder to transgress the accustomed uses of society.\r\nPalaces were deserted, and the poor man dared at length, unreproved,\r\nintrude into the splendid apartments, whose very furniture and\r\ndecorations were an unknown world to him. It was found, that, though at\r\nfirst the stop put to all circulation of property, had reduced those\r\nbefore supported by the factitious wants of society to sudden and\r\nhideous poverty, yet when the boundaries of private possession were\r\nthrown down, the products of human labour at present existing were\r\nmore, far more, than the thinned generation could possibly consume. To\r\nsome among the poor this was matter of exultation. We were all equal\r\nnow; magnificent dwellings, luxurious carpets, and beds of down, were\r\nafforded to all. Carriages and horses, gardens, pictures, statues, and\r\nprincely libraries, there were enough of these even to superfluity; and\r\nthere was nothing to prevent each from assuming possession of his\r\nshare. We were all equal now; but near at hand was an equality still\r\nmore levelling, a state where beauty and strength, and wisdom, would be\r\nas vain as riches and birth. The grave yawned beneath us all, and its\r\nprospect prevented any of us from enjoying the ease and plenty which in\r\nso awful a manner was presented to us.\r\n\r\nStill the bloom did not fade on the cheeks of my babes; and Clara\r\nsprung up in years and growth, unsullied by disease. We had no reason\r\nto think the site of Windsor Castle peculiarly healthy, for many other\r\nfamilies had expired beneath its roof; we lived therefore without any\r\nparticular precaution; but we lived, it seemed, in safety. If Idris\r\nbecame thin and pale, it was anxiety that occasioned the change; an\r\nanxiety I could in no way alleviate. She never complained, but sleep\r\nand appetite fled from her, a slow fever preyed on her veins, her\r\ncolour was hectic, and she often wept in secret; gloomy\r\nprognostications, care, and agonizing dread, ate up the principle of\r\nlife within her. I could not fail to perceive this change. I often\r\nwished that I had permitted her to take her own course, and engage\r\nherself in such labours for the welfare of others as might have\r\ndistracted her thoughts. But it was too late now. Besides that, with\r\nthe nearly extinct race of man, all our toils grew near a conclusion,\r\nshe was too weak; consumption, if so it might be called, or rather the\r\nover active life within her, which, as with Adrian, spent the vital oil\r\nin the early morning hours, deprived her limbs of strength. At night,\r\nwhen she could leave me unperceived, she wandered through the house, or\r\nhung over the couches of her children; and in the day time would sink\r\ninto a perturbed sleep, while her murmurs and starts betrayed the\r\nunquiet dreams that vexed her. As this state of wretchedness became\r\nmore confirmed, and, in spite of her endeavours at concealment more\r\napparent, I strove, though vainly, to awaken in her courage and hope. I\r\ncould not wonder at the vehemence of her care; her very soul was\r\ntenderness; she trusted indeed that she should not outlive me if I\r\nbecame the prey of the vast calamity, and this thought sometimes\r\nrelieved her. We had for many years trod the highway of life hand in\r\nhand, and still thus linked, we might step within the shades of death;\r\nbut her children, her lovely, playful, animated children\xe2\x80\x94beings sprung\r\nfrom her own dear side\xe2\x80\x94portions of her own being\xe2\x80\x94depositories of our\r\nloves\xe2\x80\x94even if we died, it would be comfort to know that they ran man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccustomed course. But it would not be so; young and blooming as they\r\nwere, they would die, and from the hopes of maturity, from the proud\r\nname of attained manhood, they were cut off for ever. Often with\r\nmaternal affection she had figured their merits and talents exerted on\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s wide stage. Alas for these latter days! The world had grown old,\r\nand all its inmates partook of the decrepitude. Why talk of infancy,\r\nmanhood, and old age? We all stood equal sharers of the last throes of\r\ntime-worn nature. Arrived at the same point of the world\xe2\x80\x99s age\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas no difference in us; the name of parent and child had lost their\r\nmeaning; young boys and girls were level now with men. This was all\r\ntrue; but it was not less agonizing to take the admonition home.\r\n\r\nWhere could we turn, and not find a desolation pregnant with the dire\r\nlesson of example? The fields had been left uncultivated, weeds and\r\ngaudy flowers sprung up,\xe2\x80\x94or where a few wheat-fields shewed signs of\r\nthe living hopes of the husbandman, the work had been left halfway, the\r\nploughman had died beside the plough; the horses had deserted the\r\nfurrow, and no seedsman had approached the dead; the cattle unattended\r\nwandered over the fields and through the lanes; the tame inhabitants of\r\nthe poultry yard, baulked of their daily food, had become wild\xe2\x80\x94young\r\nlambs were dropt in flower-gardens, and the cow stalled in the hall of\r\npleasure. Sickly and few, the country people neither went out to sow\r\nnor reap; but sauntered about the meadows, or lay under the hedges,\r\nwhen the inclement sky did not drive them to take shelter under the\r\nnearest roof. Many of those who remained, secluded themselves; some had\r\nlaid up stores which should prevent the necessity of leaving their\r\nhomes;\xe2\x80\x94some deserted wife and child, and imagined that they secured\r\ntheir safety in utter solitude. Such had been Ryland\xe2\x80\x99s plan, and he was\r\ndiscovered dead and half-devoured by insects, in a house many miles\r\nfrom any other, with piles of food laid up in useless superfluity.\r\nOthers made long journies to unite themselves to those they loved, and\r\narrived to find them dead.\r\n\r\nLondon did not contain above a thousand inhabitants; and this number\r\nwas continually diminishing. Most of them were country people, come up\r\nfor the sake of change; the Londoners had sought the country. The busy\r\neastern part of the town was silent, or at most you saw only where,\r\nhalf from cupidity, half from curiosity, the warehouses had been more\r\nransacked than pillaged: bales of rich India goods, shawls of price,\r\njewels, and spices, unpacked, strewed the floors. In some places the\r\npossessor had to the last kept watch on his store, and died before the\r\nbarred gates. The massy portals of the churches swung creaking on their\r\nhinges; and some few lay dead on the pavement. The wretched female,\r\nloveless victim of vulgar brutality, had wandered to the toilet of\r\nhigh-born beauty, and, arraying herself in the garb of splendour, had\r\ndied before the mirror which reflected to herself alone her altered\r\nappearance. Women whose delicate feet had seldom touched the earth in\r\ntheir luxury, had fled in fright and horror from their homes, till,\r\nlosing themselves in the squalid streets of the metropolis, they had\r\ndied on the threshold of poverty. The heart sickened at the variety of\r\nmisery presented; and, when I saw a specimen of this gloomy change, my\r\nsoul ached with the fear of what might befall my beloved Idris and my\r\nbabes. Were they, surviving Adrian and myself, to find themselves\r\nprotectorless in the world? As yet the mind alone had suffered\xe2\x80\x94could I\r\nfor ever put off the time, when the delicate frame and shrinking nerves\r\nof my child of prosperity, the nursling of rank and wealth, who was my\r\ncompanion, should be invaded by famine, hardship, and disease? Better\r\ndie at once\xe2\x80\x94better plunge a poinard in her bosom, still untouched by\r\ndrear adversity, and then again sheathe it in my own! But, no; in times\r\nof misery we must fight against our destinies, and strive not to be\r\novercome by them. I would not yield, but to the last gasp resolutely\r\ndefended my dear ones against sorrow and pain; and if I were vanquished\r\nat last, it should not be ingloriously. I stood in the gap, resisting\r\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x94the impalpable, invisible foe, who had so long besieged us\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nyet he had made no breach: it must be my care that he should not,\r\nsecretly undermining, burst up within the very threshold of the temple\r\nof love, at whose altar I daily sacrificed. The hunger of Death was now\r\nstung more sharply by the diminution of his food: or was it that\r\nbefore, the survivors being many, the dead were less eagerly counted?\r\nNow each life was a gem, each human breathing form of far, O! far more\r\nworth than subtlest imagery of sculptured stone; and the daily, nay,\r\nhourly decrease visible in our numbers, visited the heart with\r\nsickening misery. This summer extinguished our hopes, the vessel of\r\nsociety was wrecked, and the shattered raft, which carried the few\r\nsurvivors over the sea of misery, was riven and tempest tost. Man\r\nexisted by twos and threes; man, the individual who might sleep, and\r\nwake, and perform the animal functions; but man, in himself weak, yet\r\nmore powerful in congregated numbers than wind or ocean; man, the\r\nqueller of the elements, the lord of created nature, the peer of\r\ndemi-gods, existed no longer.\r\n\r\nFarewell to the patriotic scene, to the love of liberty and well earned\r\nmeed of virtuous aspiration!\xe2\x80\x94farewell to crowded senate, vocal with the\r\ncouncils of the wise, whose laws were keener than the sword blade\r\ntempered at Damascus!\xe2\x80\x94farewell to kingly pomp and warlike pageantry;\r\nthe crowns are in the dust, and the wearers are in their\r\ngraves!\xe2\x80\x94farewell to the desire of rule, and the hope of victory; to\r\nhigh vaulting ambition, to the appetite for praise, and the craving for\r\nthe suffrage of their fellows! The nations are no longer! No senate\r\nsits in council for the dead; no scion of a time honoured dynasty pants\r\nto rule over the inhabitants of a charnel house; the general\xe2\x80\x99s hand is\r\ncold, and the soldier has his untimely grave dug in his native fields,\r\nunhonoured, though in youth. The market-place is empty, the candidate\r\nfor popular favour finds none whom he can represent. To chambers of\r\npainted state farewell!\xe2\x80\x94To midnight revelry, and the panting emulation\r\nof beauty, to costly dress and birth-day shew, to title and the gilded\r\ncoronet, farewell!\r\n\r\nFarewell to the giant powers of man,\xe2\x80\x94to knowledge that could pilot the\r\ndeep-drawing bark through the opposing waters of shoreless ocean,\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nscience that directed the silken balloon through the pathless air,\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nthe power that could put a barrier to mighty waters, and set in motion\r\nwheels, and beams, and vast machinery, that could divide rocks of\r\ngranite or marble, and make the mountains plain!\r\n\r\nFarewell to the arts,\xe2\x80\x94to eloquence, which is to the human mind as the\r\nwinds to the sea, stirring, and then allaying it;\xe2\x80\x94farewell to poetry\r\nand deep philosophy, for man\xe2\x80\x99s imagination is cold, and his enquiring\r\nmind can no longer expatiate on the wonders of life, for \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no\r\nwork, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou\r\ngoest!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to the graceful building, which in its perfect proportion\r\ntranscended the rude forms of nature, the fretted gothic and massy\r\nsaracenic pile, to the stupendous arch and glorious dome, the fluted\r\ncolumn with its capital, Corinthian, Ionic, or Doric, the peristyle and\r\nfair entablature, whose harmony of form is to the eye as musical\r\nconcord to the ear!\xe2\x80\x94farewell to sculpture, where the pure marble mocks\r\nhuman flesh, and in the plastic expression of the culled excellencies\r\nof the human shape, shines forth the god!\xe2\x80\x94farewell to painting, the\r\nhigh wrought sentiment and deep knowledge of the artists\xe2\x80\x99s mind in\r\npictured canvas\xe2\x80\x94to paradisaical scenes, where trees are ever vernal,\r\nand the ambrosial air rests in perpetual glow:\xe2\x80\x94to the stamped form of\r\ntempest, and wildest uproar of universal nature encaged in the narrow\r\nframe, O farewell! Farewell to music, and the sound of song; to the\r\nmarriage of instruments, where the concord of soft and harsh unites in\r\nsweet harmony, and gives wings to the panting listeners, whereby to\r\nclimb heaven, and learn the hidden pleasures of the eternals!\xe2\x80\x94Farewell\r\nto the well-trod stage; a truer tragedy is enacted on the world\xe2\x80\x99s ample\r\nscene, that puts to shame mimic grief: to high-bred comedy, and the low\r\nbuffoon, farewell!\xe2\x80\x94Man may laugh no more. Alas! to enumerate the\r\nadornments of humanity, shews, by what we have lost, how supremely\r\ngreat man was. It is all over now. He is solitary; like our first\r\nparents expelled from Paradise, he looks back towards the scene he has\r\nquitted. The high walls of the tomb, and the flaming sword of plague,\r\nlie between it and him. Like to our first parents, the whole earth is\r\nbefore him, a wide desart. Unsupported and weak, let him wander through\r\nfields where the unreaped corn stands in barren plenty, through copses\r\nplanted by his fathers, through towns built for his use. Posterity is\r\nno more; fame, and ambition, and love, are words void of meaning; even\r\nas the cattle that grazes in the field, do thou, O deserted one, lie\r\ndown at evening-tide, unknowing of the past, careless of the future,\r\nfor from such fond ignorance alone canst thou hope for ease!\r\n\r\nJoy paints with its own colours every act and thought. The happy do not\r\nfeel poverty\xe2\x80\x94for delight is as a gold-tissued robe, and crowns them\r\nwith priceless gems. Enjoyment plays the cook to their homely fare, and\r\nmingles intoxication with their simple drink. Joy strews the hard couch\r\nwith roses, and makes labour ease.\r\n\r\nSorrow doubles the burthen to the bent-down back; plants thorns in the\r\nunyielding pillow; mingles gall with water; adds saltness to their\r\nbitter bread; cloathing them in rags, and strewing ashes on their bare\r\nheads. To our irremediable distress every small and pelting\r\ninconvenience came with added force; we had strung our frames to endure\r\nthe Atlean weight thrown on us; we sank beneath the added feather\r\nchance threw on us, \xe2\x80\x9cthe grasshopper was a burthen.\xe2\x80\x9d Many of the\r\nsurvivors had been bred in luxury\xe2\x80\x94their servants were gone, their\r\npowers of command vanished like unreal shadows: the poor even suffered\r\nvarious privations; and the idea of another winter like the last,\r\nbrought affright to our minds. Was it not enough that we must die, but\r\ntoil must be added?\xe2\x80\x94must we prepare our funeral repast with labour, and\r\nwith unseemly drudgery heap fuel on our deserted hearths \xe2\x80\x94must we with\r\nservile hands fabricate the garments, soon to be our shroud?\r\n\r\nNot so! We are presently to die, let us then enjoy to its full relish\r\nthe remnant of our lives. Sordid care, avaunt! menial labours, and\r\npains, slight in themselves, but too gigantic for our exhausted\r\nstrength, shall make no part of our ephemeral existences. In the\r\nbeginning of time, when, as now, man lived by families, and not by\r\ntribes or nations, they were placed in a genial clime, where earth fed\r\nthem untilled, and the balmy air enwrapt their reposing limbs with\r\nwarmth more pleasant than beds of down. The south is the native place\r\nof the human race; the land of fruits, more grateful to man than the\r\nhard-earned Ceres of the north,\xe2\x80\x94of trees, whose boughs are as a\r\npalace-roof, of couches of roses, and of the thirst-appeasing grape. We\r\nneed not there fear cold and hunger.\r\n\r\nLook at England! the grass shoots up high in the meadows; but they are\r\ndank and cold, unfit bed for us. Corn we have none, and the crude\r\nfruits cannot support us. We must seek firing in the bowels of the\r\nearth, or the unkind atmosphere will fill us with rheums and aches. The\r\nlabour of hundreds of thousands alone could make this inclement nook\r\nfit habitation for one man. To the south then, to the sun!\xe2\x80\x94where nature\r\nis kind, where Jove has showered forth the contents of Amalthea\xe2\x80\x99s horn,\r\nand earth is garden.\r\n\r\nEngland, late birth-place of excellence and school of the wise, thy\r\nchildren are gone, thy glory faded! Thou, England, wert the triumph of\r\nman! Small favour was shewn thee by thy Creator, thou Isle of the\r\nNorth; a ragged canvas naturally, painted by man with alien colours;\r\nbut the hues he gave are faded, never more to be renewed. So we must\r\nleave thee, thou marvel of the world; we must bid farewell to thy\r\nclouds, and cold, and scarcity for ever! Thy manly hearts are still;\r\nthy tale of power and liberty at its close! Bereft of man, O little\r\nisle! the ocean waves will buffet thee, and the raven flap his wings\r\nover thee; thy soil will be birth-place of weeds, thy sky will canopy\r\nbarrenness. It was not for the rose of Persia thou wert famous, nor the\r\nbanana of the east; not for the spicy gales of India, nor the sugar\r\ngroves of America; not for thy vines nor thy double harvests, nor for\r\nthy vernal airs, nor solstitial sun\xe2\x80\x94but for thy children, their\r\nunwearied industry and lofty aspiration. They are gone, and thou goest\r\nwith them the oft trodden path that leads to oblivion, \xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFarewell, sad Isle, farewell, thy fatal glory\r\nIs summed, cast up, and cancelled in this story.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n [19] Elton\xe2\x80\x99s translation of Hesiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n [20] Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Poems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of this year 2096, the spirit of emigration crept in\r\namong the few survivors, who, congregating from various parts of\r\nEngland, met in London. This spirit existed as a breath, a wish, a far\r\noff thought, until communicated to Adrian, who imbibed it with ardour,\r\nand instantly engaged himself in plans for its execution. The fear of\r\nimmediate death vanished with the heats of September. Another winter\r\nwas before us, and we might elect our mode of passing it to the best\r\nadvantage. Perhaps in rational philosophy none could be better chosen\r\nthan this scheme of migration, which would draw us from the immediate\r\nscene of our woe, and, leading us through pleasant and picturesque\r\ncountries, amuse for a time our despair. The idea once broached, all\r\nwere impatient to put it in execution.\r\n\r\nWe were still at Windsor; our renewed hopes medicined the anguish we\r\nhad suffered from the late tragedies. The death of many of our inmates\r\nhad weaned us from the fond idea, that Windsor Castle was a spot sacred\r\nfrom the plague; but our lease of life was renewed for some months, and\r\neven Idris lifted her head, as a lily after a storm, when a last\r\nsunbeam tinges its silver cup. Just at this time Adrian came down to\r\nus; his eager looks shewed us that he was full of some scheme. He\r\nhastened to take me aside, and disclosed to me with rapidity his plan\r\nof emigration from England.\r\n\r\nTo leave England for ever! to turn from its polluted fields and groves,\r\nand, placing the sea between us, to quit it, as a sailor quits the rock\r\non which he has been wrecked, when the saving ship rides by. Such was\r\nhis plan.\r\n\r\nTo leave the country of our fathers, made holy by their graves!\xe2\x80\x94We\r\ncould not feel even as a voluntary exile of old, who might for pleasure\r\nor convenience forsake his native soil; though thousands of miles might\r\ndivide him, England was still a part of him, as he of her. He heard of\r\nthe passing events of the day; he knew that, if he returned, and\r\nresumed his place in society, the entrance was still open, and it\r\nrequired but the will, to surround himself at once with the\r\nassociations and habits of boyhood. Not so with us, the remnant. We\r\nleft none to represent us, none to repeople the desart land, and the\r\nname of England died, when we left her,\r\n\r\nIn vagabond pursuit of dreadful safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet let us go! England is in her shroud,\xe2\x80\x94we may not enchain ourselves\r\nto a corpse. Let us go\xe2\x80\x94the world is our country now, and we will choose\r\nfor our residence its most fertile spot. Shall we, in these desart\r\nhalls, under this wintry sky, sit with closed eyes and folded hands,\r\nexpecting death? Let us rather go out to meet it gallantly: or\r\nperhaps\xe2\x80\x94for all this pendulous orb, this fair gem in the sky\xe2\x80\x99s diadem,\r\nis not surely plague-striken\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, in some secluded nook, amidst\r\neternal spring, and waving trees, and purling streams, we may find\r\nLife. The world is vast, and England, though her many fields and wide\r\nspread woods seem interminable, is but a small part of her. At the\r\nclose of a day\xe2\x80\x99s march over high mountains and through snowy vallies,\r\nwe may come upon health, and committing our loved ones to its charge,\r\nreplant the uprooted tree of humanity, and send to late posterity the\r\ntale of the ante-pestilential race, the heroes and sages of the lost\r\nstate of things.\r\n\r\nHope beckons and sorrow urges us, the heart beats high with\r\nexpectation, and this eager desire of change must be an omen of\r\nsuccess. O come! Farewell to the dead! farewell to the tombs of those\r\nwe loved!\xe2\x80\x94farewell to giant London and the placid Thames, to river and\r\nmountain or fair district, birth-place of the wise and good, to Windsor\r\nForest and its antique castle, farewell! themes for story alone are\r\nthey,\xe2\x80\x94we must live elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSuch were in part the arguments of Adrian, uttered with enthusiasm and\r\nunanswerable rapidity. Something more was in his heart, to which he\r\ndared not give words. He felt that the end of time was come; he knew\r\nthat one by one we should dwindle into nothingness. It was not\r\nadviseable to wait this sad consummation in our native country; but\r\ntravelling would give us our object for each day, that would distract\r\nour thoughts from the swift-approaching end of things. If we went to\r\nItaly, to sacred and eternal Rome, we might with greater patience\r\nsubmit to the decree, which had laid her mighty towers low. We might\r\nlose our selfish grief in the sublime aspect of its desolation. All\r\nthis was in the mind of Adrian; but he thought of my children, and,\r\ninstead of communicating to me these resources of despair, he called up\r\nthe image of health and life to be found, where we knew not\xe2\x80\x94when we\r\nknew not; but if never to be found, for ever and for ever to be sought.\r\nHe won me over to his party, heart and soul.\r\n\r\nIt devolved on me to disclose our plan to Idris. The images of health\r\nand hope which I presented to her, made her with a smile consent. With\r\na smile she agreed to leave her country, from which she had never\r\nbefore been absent, and the spot she had inhabited from infancy; the\r\nforest and its mighty trees, the woodland paths and green recesses,\r\nwhere she had played in childhood, and had lived so happily through\r\nyouth; she would leave them without regret, for she hoped to purchase\r\nthus the lives of her children. They were her life; dearer than a spot\r\nconsecrated to love, dearer than all else the earth contained. The boys\r\nheard with childish glee of our removal: Clara asked if we were to go\r\nto Athens. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; and her countenance became\r\nradiant with pleasure. There she would behold the tomb of her parents,\r\nand the territory filled with recollections of her father\xe2\x80\x99s glory. In\r\nsilence, but without respite, she had brooded over these scenes. It was\r\nthe recollection of them that had turned her infant gaiety to\r\nseriousness, and had impressed her with high and restless thoughts.\r\n\r\nThere were many dear friends whom we must not leave behind, humble\r\nthough they were. There was the spirited and obedient steed which Lord\r\nRaymond had given his daughter; there was Alfred\xe2\x80\x99s dog and a pet eagle,\r\nwhose sight was dimmed through age. But this catalogue of favourites to\r\nbe taken with us, could not be made without grief to think of our heavy\r\nlosses, and a deep sigh for the many things we must leave behind. The\r\ntears rushed into the eyes of Idris, while Alfred and Evelyn brought\r\nnow a favourite rose tree, now a marble vase beautifully carved,\r\ninsisting that these must go, and exclaiming on the pity that we could\r\nnot take the castle and the forest, the deer and the birds, and all\r\naccustomed and cherished objects along with us. \xe2\x80\x9cFond and foolish\r\nones,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have lost for ever treasures far more precious than\r\nthese; and we desert them, to preserve treasures to which in comparison\r\nthey are nothing. Let us not for a moment forget our object and our\r\nhope; and they will form a resistless mound to stop the overflowing of\r\nour regret for trifles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children were easily distracted, and again returned to their\r\nprospect of future amusement. Idris had disappeared. She had gone to\r\nhide her weakness; escaping from the castle, she had descended to the\r\nlittle park, and sought solitude, that she might there indulge her\r\ntears; I found her clinging round an old oak, pressing its rough trunk\r\nwith her roseate lips, as her tears fell plenteously, and her sobs and\r\nbroken exclamations could not be suppressed; with surpassing grief I\r\nbeheld this loved one of my heart thus lost in sorrow! I drew her\r\ntowards me; and, as she felt my kisses on her eyelids, as she felt my\r\narms press her, she revived to the knowledge of what remained to her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind not to reproach me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI weep, and a bitter\r\npang of intolerable sorrow tears my heart. And yet I am happy; mothers\r\nlament their children, wives lose their husbands, while you and my\r\nchildren are left to me. Yes, I am happy, most happy, that I can weep\r\nthus for imaginary sorrows, and that the slight loss of my adored\r\ncountry is not dwindled and annihilated in mightier misery. Take me\r\nwhere you will; where you and my children are, there shall be Windsor,\r\nand every country will be England to me. Let these tears flow not for\r\nmyself, happy and ungrateful as I am, but for the dead world\xe2\x80\x94for our\r\nlost country\xe2\x80\x94for all of love, and life, and joy, now choked in the\r\ndusty chambers of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke quickly, as if to convince herself; she turned her eyes from\r\nthe trees and forest-paths she loved; she hid her face in my bosom, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x94 yes, _my_ masculine firmness dissolved\xe2\x80\x94we wept together consolatory\r\ntears, and then calm\xe2\x80\x94nay, almost cheerful, we returned to the castle.\r\n\r\nThe first cold weather of an English October, made us hasten our\r\npreparations. I persuaded Idris to go up to London, where she might\r\nbetter attend to necessary arrangements. I did not tell her, that to\r\nspare her the pang of parting from inanimate objects, now the only\r\nthings left, I had resolved that we should none of us return to\r\nWindsor. For the last time we looked on the wide extent of country\r\nvisible from the terrace, and saw the last rays of the sun tinge the\r\ndark masses of wood variegated by autumnal tints; the uncultivated\r\nfields and smokeless cottages lay in shadow below; the Thames wound\r\nthrough the wide plain, and the venerable pile of Eton college, stood\r\nin dark relief, a prominent object; the cawing of the myriad rooks\r\nwhich inhabited the trees of the little park, as in column or thick\r\nwedge they speeded to their nests, disturbed the silence of evening.\r\nNature was the same, as when she was the kind mother of the human race;\r\nnow, childless and forlorn, her fertility was a mockery; her loveliness\r\na mask for deformity. Why should the breeze gently stir the trees, man\r\nfelt not its refreshment? Why did dark night adorn herself with\r\nstars\xe2\x80\x94man saw them not? Why are there fruits, or flowers, or streams,\r\nman is not here to enjoy them?\r\n\r\nIdris stood beside me, her dear hand locked in mine. Her face was\r\nradiant with a smile.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe sun is alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we are not. A\r\nstrange star, my Lionel, ruled our birth; sadly and with dismay we may\r\nlook upon the annihilation of man; but we remain for each other. Did I\r\never in the wide world seek other than thee? And since in the wide\r\nworld thou remainest, why should I complain? Thou and nature are still\r\ntrue to me. Beneath the shades of night, and through the day, whose\r\ngarish light displays our solitude, thou wilt still be at my side, and\r\neven Windsor will not be regretted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had chosen night time for our journey to London, that the change and\r\ndesolation of the country might be the less observable. Our only\r\nsurviving servant drove us. We past down the steep hill, and entered\r\nthe dusky avenue of the Long Walk. At times like these, minute\r\ncircumstances assume giant and majestic proportions; the very swinging\r\nopen of the white gate that admitted us into the forest, arrested my\r\nthoughts as matter of interest; it was an every day act, never to occur\r\nagain! The setting crescent of the moon glittered through the massy\r\ntrees to our right, and when we entered the park, we scared a troop of\r\ndeer, that fled bounding away in the forest shades. Our two boys\r\nquietly slept; once, before our road turned from the view, I looked\r\nback on the castle. Its windows glistened in the moonshine, and its\r\nheavy outline lay in a dark mass against the sky\xe2\x80\x94the trees near us\r\nwaved a solemn dirge to the midnight breeze. Idris leaned back in the\r\ncarriage; her two hands pressed mine, her countenance was placid, she\r\nseemed to lose the sense of what she now left, in the memory of what\r\nshe still possessed.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts were sad and solemn, yet not of unmingled pain. The very\r\nexcess of our misery carried a relief with it, giving sublimity and\r\nelevation to sorrow. I felt that I carried with me those I best loved;\r\nI was pleased, after a long separation to rejoin Adrian; never again to\r\npart. I felt that I quitted what I loved, not what loved me. The castle\r\nwalls, and long familiar trees, did not hear the parting sound of our\r\ncarriage-wheels with regret. And, while I felt Idris to be near, and\r\nheard the regular breathing of my children, I could not be unhappy.\r\nClara was greatly moved; with streaming eyes, suppressing her sobs, she\r\nleaned from the window, watching the last glimpse of her native\r\nWindsor.\r\n\r\nAdrian welcomed us on our arrival. He was all animation; you could no\r\nlonger trace in his look of health, the suffering valetudinarian; from\r\nhis smile and sprightly tones you could not guess that he was about to\r\nlead forth from their native country, the numbered remnant of the\r\nEnglish nation, into the tenantless realms of the south, there to die,\r\none by one, till the LAST MAN should remain in a voiceless, empty\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAdrian was impatient for our departure, and had advanced far in his\r\npreparations. His wisdom guided all. His care was the soul, to move the\r\nluckless crowd, who relied wholly on him. It was useless to provide\r\nmany things, for we should find abundant provision in every town. It\r\nwas Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s wish to prevent all labour; to bestow a festive appearance\r\non this funeral train. Our numbers amounted to not quite two thousand\r\npersons. These were not all assembled in London, but each day witnessed\r\nthe arrival of fresh numbers, and those who resided in the neighbouring\r\ntowns, had received orders to assemble at one place, on the twentieth\r\nof November. Carriages and horses were provided for all; captains and\r\nunder officers chosen, and the whole assemblage wisely organized. All\r\nobeyed the Lord Protector of dying England; all looked up to him. His\r\ncouncil was chosen, it consisted of about fifty persons. Distinction\r\nand station were not the qualifications of their election. We had no\r\nstation among us, but that which benevolence and prudence gave; no\r\ndistinction save between the living and the dead. Although we were\r\nanxious to leave England before the depth of winter, yet we were\r\ndetained. Small parties had been dispatched to various parts of\r\nEngland, in search of stragglers; we would not go, until we had assured\r\nourselves that in all human probability we did not leave behind a\r\nsingle human being.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival in London, we found that the aged Countess of Windsor\r\nwas residing with her son in the palace of the Protectorate; we\r\nrepaired to our accustomed abode near Hyde Park. Idris now for the\r\nfirst time for many years saw her mother, anxious to assure herself\r\nthat the childishness of old age did not mingle with unforgotten pride,\r\nto make this high-born dame still so inveterate against me. Age and\r\ncare had furrowed her cheeks, and bent her form; but her eye was still\r\nbright, her manners authoritative and unchanged; she received her\r\ndaughter coldly, but displayed more feeling as she folded her\r\ngrand-children in her arms. It is our nature to wish to continue our\r\nsystems and thoughts to posterity through our own offspring. The\r\nCountess had failed in this design with regard to her children; perhaps\r\nshe hoped to find the next remove in birth more tractable. Once Idris\r\nnamed me casually\xe2\x80\x94a frown, a convulsive gesture of anger, shook her\r\nmother, and, with voice trembling with hate, she said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am of little\r\nworth in this world; the young are impatient to push the old off the\r\nscene; but, Idris, if you do not wish to see your mother expire at your\r\nfeet, never again name that person to me; all else I can bear; and now\r\nI am resigned to the destruction of my cherished hopes: but it is too\r\nmuch to require that I should love the instrument that providence\r\ngifted with murderous properties for my destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a strange speech, now that, on the empty stage, each might\r\nplay his part without impediment from the other. But the haughty\r\nEx-Queen thought as Octavius C\xc3\xa6sar and Mark Antony,\r\n\r\nWe could not stall together\r\nIn the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period of our departure was fixed for the twenty-fifth of November.\r\nThe weather was temperate; soft rains fell at night, and by day the\r\nwintry sun shone out. Our numbers were to move forward in separate\r\nparties, and to go by different routes, all to unite at last at Paris.\r\nAdrian and his division, consisting in all of five hundred persons,\r\nwere to take the direction of Dover and Calais. On the twentieth of\r\nNovember, Adrian and I rode for the last time through the streets of\r\nLondon. They were grass-grown and desert. The open doors of the empty\r\nmansions creaked upon their hinges; rank herbage, and deforming dirt,\r\nhad swiftly accumulated on the steps of the houses; the voiceless\r\nsteeples of the churches pierced the smokeless air; the churches were\r\nopen, but no prayer was offered at the altars; mildew and damp had\r\nalready defaced their ornaments; birds, and tame animals, now homeless,\r\nhad built nests, and made their lairs in consecrated spots. We passed\r\nSt. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s. London, which had extended so far in suburbs in all\r\ndirection, had been somewhat deserted in the midst, and much of what\r\nhad in former days obscured this vast building was removed. Its\r\nponderous mass, blackened stone, and high dome, made it look, not like\r\na temple, but a tomb. Methought above the portico was engraved the _Hic\r\njacet_ of England. We passed on eastwards, engaged in such solemn talk\r\nas the times inspired. No human step was heard, nor human form\r\ndiscerned. Troops of dogs, deserted of their masters, passed us; and\r\nnow and then a horse, unbridled and unsaddled, trotted towards us, and\r\ntried to attract the attention of those which we rode, as if to allure\r\nthem to seek like liberty. An unwieldy ox, who had fed in an abandoned\r\ngranary, suddenly lowed, and shewed his shapeless form in a narrow\r\ndoor-way; every thing was desert; but nothing was in ruin. And this\r\nmedley of undamaged buildings, and luxurious accommodation, in trim and\r\nfresh youth, was contrasted with the lonely silence of the unpeopled\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nNight closed in, and it began to rain. We were about to return\r\nhomewards, when a voice, a human voice, strange now to hear, attracted\r\nour attention. It was a child singing a merry, lightsome air; there was\r\nno other sound. We had traversed London from Hyde Park even to where we\r\nnow were in the Minories, and had met no person, heard no voice nor\r\nfootstep. The singing was interrupted by laughing and talking; never\r\nwas merry ditty so sadly timed, never laughter more akin to tears. The\r\ndoor of the house from which these sounds proceeded was open, the upper\r\nrooms were illuminated as for a feast. It was a large magnificent\r\nhouse, in which doubtless some rich merchant had lived. The singing\r\nagain commenced, and rang through the high-roofed rooms, while we\r\nsilently ascended the stair-case. Lights now appeared to guide us; and\r\na long suite of splendid rooms illuminated, made us still more wonder.\r\nTheir only inhabitant, a little girl, was dancing, waltzing, and\r\nsinging about them, followed by a large Newfoundland dog, who\r\nboisterously jumping on her, and interrupting her, made her now scold,\r\nnow laugh, now throw herself on the carpet to play with him. She was\r\ndressed grotesquely, in glittering robes and shawls fit for a woman;\r\nshe appeared about ten years of age. We stood at the door looking on\r\nthis strange scene, till the dog perceiving us barked loudly; the child\r\nturned and saw us: her face, losing its gaiety, assumed a sullen\r\nexpression: she slunk back, apparently meditating an escape. I came up\r\nto her, and held her hand; she did not resist, but with a stern brow,\r\nso strange in childhood, so different from her former hilarity, she\r\nstood still, her eyes fixed on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do here?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid gently; \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was silent, but trembled violently.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\npoor child,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9care you alone?\xe2\x80\x9d There was a winning\r\nsoftness in his voice, that went to the heart of the little girl; she\r\nlooked at him, then snatching her hand from me, threw herself into his\r\narms, clinging round his neck, ejaculating\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSave me! save me!\xe2\x80\x9d while\r\nher unnatural sullenness dissolved in tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will save you,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cof what are you afraid? you need not\r\nfear my friend, he will do you no harm. Are you alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Lion is with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your father and mother?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never had any; I am a charity girl. Every body is gone, gone for a\r\ngreat, great many days; but if they come back and find me out, they\r\nwill beat me so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer unhappy story was told in these few words: an orphan, taken on\r\npretended charity, ill-treated and reviled, her oppressors had died:\r\nunknowing of what had passed around her, she found herself alone; she\r\nhad not dared venture out, but by the continuance of her solitude her\r\ncourage revived, her childish vivacity caused her to play a thousand\r\nfreaks, and with her brute companion she passed a long holiday, fearing\r\nnothing but the return of the harsh voices and cruel usage of her\r\nprotectors. She readily consented to go with Adrian.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, while we descanted on alien sorrows, and on a\r\nsolitude which struck our eyes and not our hearts, while we imagined\r\nall of change and suffering that had intervened in these once thronged\r\nstreets, before, tenantless and abandoned, they became mere kennels for\r\ndogs, and stables for cattle:\xe2\x80\x94while we read the death of the world upon\r\nthe dark fane, and hugged ourselves in the remembrance that we\r\npossessed that which was all the world to us\xe2\x80\x94in the meanwhile\xe2\x80\x94-\r\n\r\nWe had arrived from Windsor early in October, and had now been in\r\nLondon about six weeks. Day by day, during that time, the health of my\r\nIdris declined: her heart was broken; neither sleep nor appetite, the\r\nchosen servants of health, waited on her wasted form. To watch her\r\nchildren hour by hour, to sit by me, drinking deep the dear persuasion\r\nthat I remained to her, was all her pastime. Her vivacity, so long\r\nassumed, her affectionate display of cheerfulness, her light-hearted\r\ntone and springy gait were gone. I could not disguise to myself, nor\r\ncould she conceal, her life-consuming sorrow. Still change of scene,\r\nand reviving hopes might restore her; I feared the plague only, and she\r\nwas untouched by that.\r\n\r\nI had left her this evening, reposing after the fatigues of her\r\npreparations. Clara sat beside her, relating a story to the two boys.\r\nThe eyes of Idris were closed: but Clara perceived a sudden change in\r\nthe appearance of our eldest darling; his heavy lids veiled his eyes,\r\nan unnatural colour burnt in his cheeks, his breath became short. Clara\r\nlooked at the mother; she slept, yet started at the pause the narrator\r\nmade\xe2\x80\x94 Fear of awakening and alarming her, caused Clara to go on at the\r\neager call of Evelyn, who was unaware of what was passing. Her eyes\r\nturned alternately from Alfred to Idris; with trembling accents she\r\ncontinued her tale, till she saw the child about to fall: starting\r\nforward she caught him, and her cry roused Idris. She looked on her\r\nson. She saw death stealing across his features; she laid him on a bed,\r\nshe held drink to his parched lips.\r\n\r\nYet he might be saved. If I were there, he might be saved; perhaps it\r\nwas not the plague. Without a counsellor, what could she do? stay and\r\nbehold him die! Why at that moment was I away? \xe2\x80\x9cLook to him, Clara,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI will return immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe inquired among those who, selected as the companions of our\r\njourney, had taken up their residence in our house; she heard from them\r\nmerely that I had gone out with Adrian. She entreated them to seek me:\r\nshe returned to her child, he was plunged in a frightful state of\r\ntorpor; again she rushed down stairs; all was dark, desert, and silent;\r\nshe lost all self-possession; she ran into the street; she called on my\r\nname. The pattering rain and howling wind alone replied to her. Wild\r\nfear gave wings to her feet; she darted forward to seek me, she knew\r\nnot where; but, putting all her thoughts, all her energy, all her being\r\nin speed only, most misdirected speed, she neither felt, nor feared,\r\nnor paused, but ran right on, till her strength suddenly deserted her\r\nso suddenly, that she had not thought to save herself. Her knees failed\r\nher, and she fell heavily on the pavement. She was stunned for a time;\r\nbut at length rose, and though sorely hurt, still walked on, shedding a\r\nfountain of tears, stumbling at times, going she knew not whither, only\r\nnow and then with feeble voice she called my name, adding with\r\nheart-piercing exclamations, that I was cruel and unkind. Human being\r\nthere was none to reply; and the inclemency of the night had driven the\r\nwandering animals to the habitations they had usurped. Her thin dress\r\nwas drenched with rain; her wet hair clung round her neck; she tottered\r\nthrough the dark streets; till, striking her foot against an unseen\r\nimpediment, she again fell; she could not rise; she hardly strove; but,\r\ngathering up her limbs, she resigned herself to the fury of the\r\nelements, and the bitter grief of her own heart. She breathed an\r\nearnest prayer to die speedily, for there was no relief but death.\r\nWhile hopeless of safety for herself, she ceased to lament for her\r\ndying child, but shed kindly, bitter tears for the grief I should\r\nexperience in losing her. While she lay, life almost suspended, she\r\nfelt a warm, soft hand on her brow, and a gentle female voice asked\r\nher, with expressions of tender compassion, if she could not rise? That\r\nanother human being, sympathetic and kind, should exist near, roused\r\nher; half rising, with clasped hands, and fresh springing tears, she\r\nentreated her companion to seek for me, to bid me hasten to my dying\r\nchild, to save him, for the love of heaven, to save him!\r\n\r\nThe woman raised her; she led her under shelter, she entreated her to\r\nreturn to her home, whither perhaps I had already returned. Idris\r\neasily yielded to her persuasions, she leaned on the arm of her friend,\r\nshe endeavoured to walk on, but irresistible faintness made her pause\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\nQuickened by the encreasing storm, we had hastened our return, our\r\nlittle charge was placed before Adrian on his horse. There was an\r\nassemblage of persons under the portico of our house, in whose gestures\r\nI instinctively read some heavy change, some new misfortune. With swift\r\nalarm, afraid to ask a single question, I leapt from my horse; the\r\nspectators saw me, knew me, and in awful silence divided to make way\r\nfor me. I snatched a light, and rushing up stairs, and hearing a groan,\r\nwithout reflection I threw open the door of the first room that\r\npresented itself. It was quite dark; but, as I stept within, a\r\npernicious scent assailed my senses, producing sickening qualms, which\r\nmade their way to my very heart, while I felt my leg clasped, and a\r\ngroan repeated by the person that held me. I lowered my lamp, and saw a\r\nnegro half clad, writhing under the agony of disease, while he held me\r\nwith a convulsive grasp. With mixed horror and impatience I strove to\r\ndisengage myself, and fell on the sufferer; he wound his naked\r\nfestering arms round me, his face was close to mine, and his breath,\r\ndeath-laden, entered my vitals. For a moment I was overcome, my head\r\nwas bowed by aching nausea; till, reflection returning, I sprung up,\r\nthrew the wretch from me, and darting up the staircase, entered the\r\nchamber usually inhabited by my family. A dim light shewed me Alfred on\r\na couch; Clara trembling, and paler than whitest snow, had raised him\r\non her arm, holding a cup of water to his lips. I saw full well that no\r\nspark of life existed in that ruined form, his features were rigid, his\r\neyes glazed, his head had fallen back. I took him from her, I laid him\r\nsoftly down, kissed his cold little mouth, and turned to speak in a\r\nvain whisper, when loudest sound of thunderlike cannon could not have\r\nreached him in his immaterial abode.\r\n\r\nAnd where was Idris? That she had gone out to seek me, and had not\r\nreturned, were fearful tidings, while the rain and driving wind\r\nclattered against the window, and roared round the house. Added to\r\nthis, the sickening sensation of disease gained upon me; no time was to\r\nbe lost, if ever I would see her again. I mounted my horse and rode out\r\nto seek her, fancying that I heard her voice in every gust, oppressed\r\nby fever and aching pain.\r\n\r\nI rode in the dark and rain through the labyrinthine streets of\r\nunpeopled London. My child lay dead at home; the seeds of mortal\r\ndisease had taken root in my bosom; I went to seek Idris, my adored,\r\nnow wandering alone, while the waters were rushing from heaven like a\r\ncataract to bathe her dear head in chill damp, her fair limbs in\r\nnumbing cold. A female stood on the step of a door, and called to me as\r\nI gallopped past. It was not Idris; so I rode swiftly on, until a kind\r\nof second sight, a reflection back again on my senses of what I had\r\nseen but not marked, made me feel sure that another figure, thin,\r\ngraceful and tall, stood clinging to the foremost person who supported\r\nher. In a minute I was beside the suppliant, in a minute I received the\r\nsinking Idris in my arms. Lifting her up, I placed her on the horse;\r\nshe had not strength to support herself; so I mounted behind her, and\r\nheld her close to my bosom, wrapping my riding-cloak round her, while\r\nher companion, whose well known, but changed countenance, (it was\r\nJuliet, daughter of the Duke of L\xe2\x80\x94-) could at this moment of horror\r\nobtain from me no more than a passing glance of compassion. She took\r\nthe abandoned rein, and conducted our obedient steed homewards. Dare I\r\navouch it? That was the last moment of my happiness; but I was happy.\r\nIdris must die, for her heart was broken: I must die, for I had caught\r\nthe plague; earth was a scene of desolation; hope was madness; life had\r\nmarried death; they were one; but, thus supporting my fainting love,\r\nthus feeling that I must soon die, I revelled in the delight of\r\npossessing her once more; again and again I kissed her, and pressed her\r\nto my heart.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at our home. I assisted her to dismount, I carried her up\r\nstairs, and gave her into Clara\xe2\x80\x99s care, that her wet garments might be\r\nchanged. Briefly I assured Adrian of her safety, and requested that we\r\nmight be left to repose. As the miser, who with trembling caution\r\nvisits his treasure to count it again and again, so I numbered each\r\nmoment, and grudged every one that was not spent with Idris. I returned\r\nswiftly to the chamber where the life of my life reposed; before I\r\nentered the room I paused for a few seconds; for a few seconds I tried\r\nto examine my state; sickness and shuddering ever and anon came over\r\nme; my head was heavy, my chest oppressed, my legs bent under me; but I\r\nthrew off resolutely the swift growing symptoms of my disorder, and met\r\nIdris with placid and even joyous looks. She was lying on a couch;\r\ncarefully fastening the door to prevent all intrusion; I sat by her, we\r\nembraced, and our lips met in a kiss long drawn and breathless\xe2\x80\x94would\r\nthat moment had been my last!\r\n\r\nMaternal feeling now awoke in my poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s bosom, and she asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nAlfred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdris,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are spared to each other, we are together; do\r\nnot let any other idea intrude. I am happy; even on this fatal night, I\r\ndeclare myself happy, beyond all name, all thought\xe2\x80\x94what would you more,\r\nsweet one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIdris understood me: she bowed her head on my shoulder and wept. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe again asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you tremble, Lionel, what shakes you thus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell may I be shaken,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9chappy as I am. Our child is dead,\r\nand the present hour is dark and ominous. Well may I tremble! but, I am\r\nhappy, mine own Idris, most happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand thee, my kind love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Idris, \xe2\x80\x9cthus\xe2\x80\x94pale as thou art\r\nwith sorrow at our loss; trembling and aghast, though wouldest assuage\r\nmy grief by thy dear assurances. I am not happy,\xe2\x80\x9d (and the tears\r\nflashed and fell from under her down-cast lids), \xe2\x80\x9cfor we are inmates of\r\na miserable prison, and there is no joy for us; but the true love I\r\nbear you will render this and every other loss endurable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been happy together, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cno future misery can\r\ndeprive us of the past. We have been true to each other for years, ever\r\nsince my sweet princess-love came through the snow to the lowly cottage\r\nof the poverty-striken heir of the ruined Verney. Even now, that\r\neternity is before us, we take hope only from the presence of each\r\nother. Idris, do you think, that when we die, we shall be divided?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDie! when we die! what mean you? What secret lies hid from me in those\r\ndreadful words?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust we not all die, dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked with a sad smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious God! are you ill, Lionel, that you speak of death? My only\r\nfriend, heart of my heart, speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we have any of us long to live; and\r\nwhen the curtain drops on this mortal scene, where, think you, we shall\r\nfind ourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d Idris was calmed by my unembarrassed tone and look;\r\nshe answered:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou may easily believe that during this long progress of\r\nthe plague, I have thought much on death, and asked myself, now that\r\nall mankind is dead to this life, to what other life they may have been\r\nborne. Hour after hour, I have dwelt on these thoughts, and strove to\r\nform a rational conclusion concerning the mystery of a future state.\r\nWhat a scare-crow, indeed, would death be, if we were merely to cast\r\naside the shadow in which we now walk, and, stepping forth into the\r\nunclouded sunshine of knowledge and love, revived with the same\r\ncompanions, the same affections, and reached the fulfilment of our\r\nhopes, leaving our fears with our earthly vesture in the grave. Alas!\r\nthe same strong feeling which makes me sure that I shall not wholly\r\ndie, makes me refuse to believe that I shall live wholly as I do now.\r\nYet, Lionel, never, never, can I love any but you; through eternity I\r\nmust desire your society; and, as I am innocent of harm to others, and\r\nas relying and confident as my mortal nature permits, I trust that the\r\nRuler of the world will never tear us asunder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour remarks are like yourself, dear love,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cgentle and\r\ngood; let us cherish such a belief, and dismiss anxiety from our minds.\r\nBut, sweet, we are so formed, (and there is no sin, if God made our\r\nnature, to yield to what he ordains), we are so formed, that we must\r\nlove life, and cling to it; we must love the living smile, the\r\nsympathetic touch, and thrilling voice, peculiar to our mortal\r\nmechanism. Let us not, through security in hereafter, neglect the\r\npresent. This present moment, short as it is, is a part of eternity,\r\nand the dearest part, since it is our own unalienably. Thou, the hope\r\nof my futurity, art my present joy. Let me then look on thy dear eyes,\r\nand, reading love in them, drink intoxicating pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTimidly, for my vehemence somewhat terrified her, Idris looked on me.\r\nMy eyes were bloodshot, starting from my head; every artery beat,\r\nmethought, audibly, every muscle throbbed, each single nerve felt. Her\r\nlook of wild affright told me, that I could no longer keep my\r\nsecret:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is, mine own beloved,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe last hour of many\r\nhappy ones is arrived, nor can we shun any longer the inevitable\r\ndestiny. I cannot live long\xe2\x80\x94but, again and again, I say, this moment is\r\nours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaler than marble, with white lips and convulsed features, Idris became\r\naware of my situation. My arm, as I sat, encircled her waist. She felt\r\nthe palm burn with fever, even on the heart it pressed:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe murmured, scarce audibly, \xe2\x80\x9conly one moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nShe kneeled, and hiding her face in her hands, uttered a brief, but\r\nearnest prayer, that she might fulfil her duty, and watch over me to\r\nthe last. While there was hope, the agony had been unendurable;\xe2\x80\x94all was\r\nnow concluded; her feelings became solemn and calm. Even as Epicharis,\r\nunperturbed and firm, submitted to the instruments of torture, did\r\nIdris, suppressing every sigh and sign of grief, enter upon the\r\nendurance of torments, of which the rack and the wheel are but faint\r\nand metaphysical symbols.\r\n\r\nI was changed; the tight-drawn cord that sounded so harshly was\r\nloosened, the moment that Idris participated in my knowledge of our\r\nreal situation. The perturbed and passion-tossed waves of thought\r\nsubsided, leaving only the heavy swell that kept right on without any\r\noutward manifestation of its disturbance, till it should break on the\r\nremote shore towards which I rapidly advanced:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that I am\r\nsick,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand your society, my Idris is my only medicine; come,\r\nand sit beside me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made me lie down on the couch, and, drawing a low ottoman near, sat\r\nclose to my pillow, pressing my burning hands in her cold palms. She\r\nyielded to my feverish restlessness, and let me talk, and talked to me,\r\non subjects strange indeed to beings, who thus looked the last, and\r\nheard the last, of what they loved alone in the world. We talked of\r\ntimes gone by; of the happy period of our early love; of Raymond,\r\nPerdita, and Evadne. We talked of what might arise on this desert\r\nearth, if, two or three being saved, it were slowly re-peopled.\xe2\x80\x94We\r\ntalked of what was beyond the tomb; and, man in his human shape being\r\nnearly extinct, we felt with certainty of faith, that other spirits,\r\nother minds, other perceptive beings, sightless to us, must people with\r\nthought and love this beauteous and imperishable universe.\r\n\r\nWe talked\xe2\x80\x94I know not how long\xe2\x80\x94but, in the morning I awoke from a\r\npainful heavy slumber; the pale cheek of Idris rested on my pillow; the\r\nlarge orbs of her eyes half raised the lids, and shewed the deep blue\r\nlights beneath; her lips were unclosed, and the slight murmurs they\r\nformed told that, even while asleep, she suffered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she were dead,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI thought, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat difference? now that form is the temple of a residing\r\ndeity; those eyes are the windows of her soul; all grace, love, and\r\nintelligence are throned on that lovely bosom\xe2\x80\x94were she dead, where\r\nwould this mind, the dearer half of mine, be? For quickly the fair\r\nproportion of this edifice would be more defaced, than are the\r\nsand-choked ruins of the desert temples of Palmyra.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdris stirred and awoke; alas! she awoke to misery. She saw the signs\r\nof disease on my countenance, and wondered how she could permit the\r\nlong night to pass without her having sought, not cure, that was\r\nimpossible, but alleviation to my sufferings. She called Adrian; my\r\ncouch was quickly surrounded by friends and assistants, and such\r\nmedicines as were judged fitting were administered. It was the peculiar\r\nand dreadful distinction of our visitation, that none who had been\r\nattacked by the pestilence had recovered. The first symptom of the\r\ndisease was the death-warrant, which in no single instance had been\r\nfollowed by pardon or reprieve. No gleam of hope therefore cheered my\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWhile fever producing torpor, heavy pains, sitting like lead on my\r\nlimbs, and making my breast heave, were upon me; I continued insensible\r\nto every thing but pain, and at last even to that. I awoke on the\r\nfourth morning as from a dreamless sleep. An irritating sense of\r\nthirst, and, when I strove to speak or move, an entire dereliction of\r\npower, was all I felt.\r\n\r\nFor three days and nights Idris had not moved from my side. She\r\nadministered to all my wants, and never slept nor rested. She did not\r\nhope; and therefore she neither endeavoured to read the physician\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance, nor to watch for symptoms of recovery. All her thought was\r\nto attend on me to the last, and then to lie down and die beside me. On\r\nthe third night animation was suspended; to the eye and touch of all I\r\nwas dead. With earnest prayer, almost with force, Adrian tried to draw\r\nIdris from me. He exhausted every adjuration, her child\xe2\x80\x99s welfare and\r\nhis own. She shook her head, and wiped a stealing tear from her sunk\r\ncheek, but would not yield; she entreated to be allowed to watch me\r\nthat one night only, with such affliction and meek earnestness, that\r\nshe gained her point, and sat silent and motionless, except when, stung\r\nby intolerable remembrance, she kissed my closed eyes and pallid lips,\r\nand pressed my stiffening hands to her beating heart.\r\n\r\nAt dead of night, when, though it was mid winter, the cock crowed at\r\nthree o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as herald of the morning change, while hanging over me,\r\nand mourning in silent, bitter thought for the loss of all of love\r\ntowards her that had been enshrined in my heart; her dishevelled hair\r\nhung over her face, and the long tresses fell on the bed; she saw one\r\nringlet in motion, and the scattered hair slightly stirred, as by a\r\nbreath. It is not so, she thought, for he will never breathe more.\r\nSeveral times the same thing occurred, and she only marked it by the\r\nsame reflection; till the whole ringlet waved back, and she thought she\r\nsaw my breast heave. Her first emotion was deadly fear, cold dew stood\r\non her brow; my eyes half opened; and, re-assured, she would have\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHe lives!\xe2\x80\x9d but the words were choked by a spasm, and she\r\nfell with a groan on the floor.\r\n\r\nAdrian was in the chamber. After long watching, he had unwillingly\r\nfallen into a sleep. He started up, and beheld his sister senseless on\r\nthe earth, weltering in a stream of blood that gushed from her mouth.\r\nEncreasing signs of life in me in some degree explained her state; the\r\nsurprise, the burst of joy, the revulsion of every sentiment, had been\r\ntoo much for her frame, worn by long months of care, late shattered by\r\nevery species of woe and toil. She was now in far greater danger than\r\nI, the wheels and springs of my life, once again set in motion,\r\nacquired elasticity from their short suspension. For a long time, no\r\none believed that I should indeed continue to live; during the reign of\r\nthe plague upon earth, not one person, attacked by the grim disease,\r\nhad recovered. My restoration was looked on as a deception; every\r\nmoment it was expected that the evil symptoms would recur with\r\nredoubled violence, until confirmed convalescence, absence of all fever\r\nor pain, and encreasing strength, brought slow conviction that I had\r\nrecovered from the plague.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of Idris was more problematical. When I had been\r\nattacked by illness, her cheeks were sunk, her form emaciated; but now,\r\nthe vessel, which had broken from the effects of extreme agitation, did\r\nnot entirely heal, but was as a channel that drop by drop drew from her\r\nthe ruddy stream that vivified her heart. Her hollow eyes and worn\r\ncountenance had a ghastly appearance; her cheek-bones, her open fair\r\nbrow, the projection of the mouth, stood fearfully prominent; you might\r\ntell each bone in the thin anatomy of her frame. Her hand hung\r\npowerless; each joint lay bare, so that the light penetrated through\r\nand through. It was strange that life could exist in what was wasted\r\nand worn into a very type of death.\r\n\r\nTo take her from these heart-breaking scenes, to lead her to forget the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s desolation in the variety of objects presented by travelling,\r\nand to nurse her failing strength in the mild climate towards which we\r\nhad resolved to journey, was my last hope for her preservation. The\r\npreparations for our departure, which had been suspended during my\r\nillness, were renewed. I did not revive to doubtful convalescence;\r\nhealth spent her treasures upon me; as the tree in spring may feel from\r\nits wrinkled limbs the fresh green break forth, and the living sap rise\r\nand circulate, so did the renewed vigour of my frame, the cheerful\r\ncurrent of my blood, the new-born elasticity of my limbs, influence my\r\nmind to cheerful endurance and pleasurable thoughts. My body, late the\r\nheavy weight that bound me to the tomb, was exuberant with health; mere\r\ncommon exercises were insufficient for my reviving strength; methought\r\nI could emulate the speed of the race-horse, discern through the air\r\nobjects at a blinding distance, hear the operations of nature in her\r\nmute abodes; my senses had become so refined and susceptible after my\r\nrecovery from mortal disease.\r\n\r\nHope, among my other blessings, was not denied to me; and I did fondly\r\ntrust that my unwearied attentions would restore my adored girl. I was\r\ntherefore eager to forward our preparations. According to the plan\r\nfirst laid down, we were to have quitted London on the twenty-fifth of\r\nNovember; and, in pursuance of this scheme, two-thirds of our\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94_the_ people\xe2\x80\x94 all that remained of England, had gone forward,\r\nand had already been some weeks in Paris. First my illness, and\r\nsubsequently that of Idris, had detained Adrian with his division,\r\nwhich consisted of three hundred persons, so that we now departed on\r\nthe first of January, 2098. It was my wish to keep Idris as distant as\r\npossible from the hurry and clamour of the crowd, and to hide from her\r\nthose appearances that would remind her most forcibly of our real\r\nsituation. We separated ourselves to a great degree from Adrian, who\r\nwas obliged to give his whole time to public business. The Countess of\r\nWindsor travelled with her son. Clara, Evelyn, and a female who acted\r\nas our attendant, were the only persons with whom we had contact. We\r\noccupied a commodious carriage, our servant officiated as coachman. A\r\nparty of about twenty persons preceded us at a small distance. They had\r\nit in charge to prepare our halting places and our nightly abode. They\r\nhad been selected for this service out of a great number that offered,\r\non account of the superior sagacity of the man who had been appointed\r\ntheir leader.\r\n\r\nImmediately on our departure, I was delighted to find a change in\r\nIdris, which I fondly hoped prognosticated the happiest results. All\r\nthe cheerfulness and gentle gaiety natural to her revived. She was\r\nweak, and this alteration was rather displayed in looks and voice than\r\nin acts; but it was permanent and real. My recovery from the plague and\r\nconfirmed health instilled into her a firm belief that I was now secure\r\nfrom this dread enemy. She told me that she was sure she should\r\nrecover. That she had a presentiment, that the tide of calamity which\r\ndeluged our unhappy race had now turned. That the remnant would be\r\npreserved, and among them the dear objects of her tender affection; and\r\nthat in some selected spot we should wear out our lives together in\r\npleasant society. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not let my state of feebleness deceive you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that I am better; there is a quick life within me, and a\r\nspirit of anticipation that assures me, that I shall continue long to\r\nmake a part of this world. I shall throw off this degrading weakness of\r\nbody, which infects even my mind with debility, and I shall enter again\r\non the performance of my duties. I was sorry to leave Windsor: but now\r\nI am weaned from this local attachment; I am content to remove to a\r\nmild climate, which will complete my recovery. Trust me, dearest, I\r\nshall neither leave you, nor my brother, nor these dear children; my\r\nfirm determination to remain with you to the last, and to continue to\r\ncontribute to your happiness and welfare, would keep me alive, even if\r\ngrim death were nearer at hand than he really is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was only half re-assured by these expressions; I could not believe\r\nthat the over-quick flow of her blood was a sign of health, or that her\r\nburning cheeks denoted convalescence. But I had no fears of an\r\nimmediate catastrophe; nay, I persuaded myself that she would\r\nultimately recover. And thus cheerfulness reigned in our little\r\nsociety. Idris conversed with animation on a thousand topics. Her chief\r\ndesire was to lead our thoughts from melancholy reflections; so she\r\ndrew charming pictures of a tranquil solitude, of a beauteous retreat,\r\nof the simple manners of our little tribe, and of the patriarchal\r\nbrotherhood of love, which would survive the ruins of the populous\r\nnations which had lately existed. We shut out from our thoughts the\r\npresent, and withdrew our eyes from the dreary landscape we traversed.\r\nWinter reigned in all its gloom. The leafless trees lay without motion\r\nagainst the dun sky; the forms of frost, mimicking the foliage of\r\nsummer, strewed the ground; the paths were overgrown; the unploughed\r\ncornfields were patched with grass and weeds; the sheep congregated at\r\nthe threshold of the cottage, the horned ox thrust his head from the\r\nwindow. The wind was bleak, and frequent sleet or snow-storms, added to\r\nthe melancholy appearance wintry nature assumed.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Rochester, and an accident caused us to be detained there\r\na day. During that time, a circumstance occurred that changed our\r\nplans, and which, alas! in its result changed the eternal course of\r\nevents, turning me from the pleasant new sprung hope I enjoyed, to an\r\nobscure and gloomy desert. But I must give some little explanation\r\nbefore I proceed with the final cause of our temporary alteration of\r\nplan, and refer again to those times when man walked the earth\r\nfearless, before Plague had become Queen of the World.\r\n\r\nThere resided a family in the neighbourhood of Windsor, of very humble\r\npretensions, but which had been an object of interest to us on account\r\nof one of the persons of whom it was composed. The family of the\r\nClaytons had known better days; but, after a series of reverses, the\r\nfather died a bankrupt, and the mother heartbroken, and a confirmed\r\ninvalid, retired with her five children to a little cottage between\r\nEton and Salt Hill. The eldest of these children, who was thirteen\r\nyears old, seemed at once from the influence of adversity, to acquire\r\nthe sagacity and principle belonging to a more mature age. Her mother\r\ngrew worse and worse in health, but Lucy attended on her, and was as a\r\ntender parent to her younger brothers and sisters, and in the meantime\r\nshewed herself so good-humoured, social, and benevolent, that she was\r\nbeloved as well as honoured, in her little neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nLucy was besides extremely pretty; so when she grew to be sixteen, it\r\nwas to be supposed, notwithstanding her poverty, that she should have\r\nadmirers. One of these was the son of a country-curate; he was a\r\ngenerous, frank-hearted youth, with an ardent love of knowledge, and no\r\nmean acquirements. Though Lucy was untaught, her mother\xe2\x80\x99s conversation\r\nand manners gave her a taste for refinements superior to her present\r\nsituation. She loved the youth even without knowing it, except that in\r\nany difficulty she naturally turned to him for aid, and awoke with a\r\nlighter heart every Sunday, because she knew that she would be met and\r\naccompanied by him in her evening walk with her sisters. She had\r\nanother admirer, one of the head-waiters at the inn at Salt Hill. He\r\nalso was not without pretensions to urbane superiority, such as he\r\nlearnt from gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s servants and waiting-maids, who initiating him\r\nin all the slang of high life below stairs, rendered his arrogant\r\ntemper ten times more intrusive. Lucy did not disclaim him\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nincapable of that feeling; but she was sorry when she saw him approach,\r\nand quietly resisted all his endeavours to establish an intimacy. The\r\nfellow soon discovered that his rival was preferred to him; and this\r\nchanged what was at first a chance admiration into a passion, whose\r\nmain springs were envy, and a base desire to deprive his competitor of\r\nthe advantage he enjoyed over himself.\r\n\r\nPoor Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s sad story was but a common one. Her lover\xe2\x80\x99s father died;\r\nand he was left destitute. He accepted the offer of a gentleman to go\r\nto India with him, feeling secure that he should soon acquire an\r\nindependence, and return to claim the hand of his beloved. He became\r\ninvolved in the war carried on there, was taken prisoner, and years\r\nelapsed before tidings of his existence were received in his native\r\nland. In the meantime disastrous poverty came on Lucy. Her little\r\ncottage, which stood looking from its trellice, covered with woodbine\r\nand jessamine, was burnt down; and the whole of their little property\r\nwas included in the destruction. Whither betake them? By what exertion\r\nof industry could Lucy procure them another abode? Her mother nearly\r\nbed-rid, could not survive any extreme of famine-struck poverty. At\r\nthis time her other admirer stept forward, and renewed his offer of\r\nmarriage. He had saved money, and was going to set up a little inn at\r\nDatchet. There was nothing alluring to Lucy in this offer, except the\r\nhome it secured to her mother; and she felt more sure of this, since\r\nshe was struck by the apparent generosity which occasioned the present\r\noffer. She accepted it; thus sacrificing herself for the comfort and\r\nwelfare of her parent.\r\n\r\nIt was some years after her marriage that we became acquainted with\r\nher. The accident of a storm caused us to take refuge in the inn, where\r\nwe witnessed the brutal and quarrelsome behaviour of her husband, and\r\nher patient endurance. Her lot was not a fortunate one. Her first lover\r\nhad returned with the hope of making her his own, and met her by\r\naccident, for the first time, as the mistress of his country inn, and\r\nthe wife of another. He withdrew despairingly to foreign parts; nothing\r\nwent well with him; at last he enlisted, and came back again wounded\r\nand sick, and yet Lucy was debarred from nursing him. Her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrutal disposition was aggravated by his yielding to the many\r\ntemptations held out by his situation, and the consequent\r\ndisarrangement of his affairs. Fortunately she had no children; but her\r\nheart was bound up in her brothers and sisters, and these his avarice\r\nand ill temper soon drove from the house; they were dispersed about the\r\ncountry, earning their livelihood with toil and care. He even shewed an\r\ninclination to get rid of her mother\xe2\x80\x94but Lucy was firm here\xe2\x80\x94she had\r\nsacrificed herself for her; she lived for her \xe2\x80\x94she would not part with\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94if the mother went, she would also go beg bread for her, die with\r\nher, but never desert her. The presence of Lucy was too necessary in\r\nkeeping up the order of the house, and in preventing the whole\r\nestablishment from going to wreck, for him to permit her to leave him.\r\nHe yielded the point; but in all accesses of anger, or in his drunken\r\nfits, he recurred to the old topic, and stung poor Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s heart by\r\nopprobrious epithets bestowed on her parent.\r\n\r\nA passion however, if it be wholly pure, entire, and reciprocal, brings\r\nwith it its own solace. Lucy was truly, and from the depth of heart,\r\ndevoted to her mother; the sole end she proposed to herself in life,\r\nwas the comfort and preservation of this parent. Though she grieved for\r\nthe result, yet she did not repent of her marriage, even when her lover\r\nreturned to bestow competence on her. Three years had intervened, and\r\nhow, in their pennyless state, could her mother have existed during\r\nthis time? This excellent woman was worthy of her child\xe2\x80\x99s devotion. A\r\nperfect confidence and friendship existed between them; besides, she\r\nwas by no means illiterate; and Lucy, whose mind had been in some\r\ndegree cultivated by her former lover, now found in her the only person\r\nwho could understand and appreciate her. Thus, though suffering, she\r\nwas by no means desolate, and when, during fine summer days, she led\r\nher mother into the flowery and shady lanes near their abode, a gleam\r\nof unmixed joy enlightened her countenance; she saw that her parent was\r\nhappy, and she knew that this happiness was of her sole creating.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her husband\xe2\x80\x99s affairs grew more and more involved; ruin was\r\nnear at hand, and she was about to lose the fruit of all her labours,\r\nwhen pestilence came to change the aspect of the world. Her husband\r\nreaped benefit from the universal misery; but, as the disaster\r\nencreased, the spirit of lawlessness seized him; he deserted his home\r\nto revel in the luxuries promised him in London, and found there a\r\ngrave. Her former lover had been one of the first victims of the\r\ndisease. But Lucy continued to live for and in her mother. Her courage\r\nonly failed when she dreaded peril for her parent, or feared that death\r\nmight prevent her from performing those duties to which she was\r\nunalterably devoted.\r\n\r\nWhen we had quitted Windsor for London, as the previous step to our\r\nfinal emigration, we visited Lucy, and arranged with her the plan of\r\nher own and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s removal. Lucy was sorry at the necessity which\r\nforced her to quit her native lanes and village, and to drag an infirm\r\nparent from her comforts at home, to the homeless waste of depopulate\r\nearth; but she was too well disciplined by adversity, and of too sweet\r\na temper, to indulge in repinings at what was inevitable.\r\n\r\nSubsequent circumstances, my illness and that of Idris, drove her from\r\nour remembrance; and we called her to mind at last, only to conclude\r\nthat she made one of the few who came from Windsor to join the\r\nemigrants, and that she was already in Paris. When we arrived at\r\nRochester therefore, we were surprised to receive, by a man just come\r\nfrom Slough, a letter from this exemplary sufferer. His account was,\r\nthat, journeying from his home, and passing through Datchet, he was\r\nsurprised to see smoke issue from the chimney of the inn, and supposing\r\nthat he should find comrades for his journey assembled there, he\r\nknocked and was admitted. There was no one in the house but Lucy, and\r\nher mother; the latter had been deprived of the use of her limbs by an\r\nattack of rheumatism, and so, one by one, all the remaining inhabitants\r\nof the country set forward, leaving them alone. Lucy intreated the man\r\nto stay with her; in a week or two her mother would be better, and they\r\nwould then set out; but they must perish, if they were left thus\r\nhelpless and forlorn. The man said, that his wife and children were\r\nalready among the emigrants, and it was therefore, according to his\r\nnotion, impossible for him to remain. Lucy, as a last resource, gave\r\nhim a letter for Idris, to be delivered to her wherever he should meet\r\nus. This commission at least he fulfilled, and Idris received with\r\nemotion the following letter:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHONOURED LADY,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure that you will remember and pity me, and I dare hope that you\r\nwill assist me; what other hope have I? Pardon my manner of writing, I\r\nam so bewildered. A month ago my dear mother was deprived of the use of\r\nher limbs. She is already better, and in another month would I am sure\r\nbe able to travel, in the way you were so kind as to say you would\r\narrange for us. But now everybody is gone\xe2\x80\x94everybody\xe2\x80\x94as they went away,\r\neach said, that perhaps my mother would be better, before we were quite\r\ndeserted. But three days ago I went to Samuel Woods, who, on account of\r\nhis new-born child, remained to the last; and there being a large\r\nfamily of them, I thought I could persuade them to wait a little longer\r\nfor us; but I found the house deserted. I have not seen a soul since,\r\ntill this good man came. \xe2\x80\x94What will become of us? My mother does not\r\nknow our state; she is so ill, that I have hidden it from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not send some one to us? I am sure we must perish miserably\r\nas we are. If I were to try to move my mother now, she would die on the\r\nroad; and if, when she gets better, I were able, I cannot guess how, to\r\nfind out the roads, and get on so many many miles to the sea, you would\r\nall be in France, and the great ocean would be between us, which is so\r\nterrible even to sailors. What would it be to me, a woman, who never\r\nsaw it? We should be imprisoned by it in this country, all, all alone,\r\nwith no help; better die where we are. I can hardly write\xe2\x80\x94I cannot stop\r\nmy tears\xe2\x80\x94it is not for myself; I could put my trust in God; and let the\r\nworst come, I think I could bear it, if I were alone. But my mother, my\r\nsick, my dear, dear mother, who never, since I was born, spoke a harsh\r\nword to me, who has been patient in many sufferings; pity her, dear\r\nLady, she must die a miserable death if you do not pity her. People\r\nspeak carelessly of her, because she is old and infirm, as if we must\r\nnot all, if we are spared, become so; and then, when the young are old\r\nthemselves, they will think that they ought to be taken care of. It is\r\nvery silly of me to write in this way to you; but, when I hear her\r\ntrying not to groan, and see her look smiling on me to comfort me, when\r\nI know she is in pain; and when I think that she does not know the\r\nworst, but she soon must; and then she will not complain; but I shall\r\nsit guessing at all that she is dwelling upon, of famine and misery\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nfeel as if my heart must break, and I do not know what I say or do; my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94mother for whom I have borne much, God preserve you from this\r\nfate! Preserve her, Lady, and He will bless you; and I, poor miserable\r\ncreature as I am, will thank you and pray for you while I live.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour unhappy and dutiful servant,\r\nLUCY MARTIN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dec_. 30_th_, 2097.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter deeply affected Idris, and she instantly proposed, that we\r\nshould return to Datchet, to assist Lucy and her mother. I said that I\r\nwould without delay set out for that place, but entreated her to join\r\nher brother, and there await my return with the children. But Idris was\r\nin high spirits, and full of hope. She declared that she could not\r\nconsent even to a temporary separation from me, but that there was no\r\nneed of this, the motion of the carriage did her good, and the distance\r\nwas too trifling to be considered. We could dispatch messengers to\r\nAdrian, to inform him of our deviation from the original plan. She\r\nspoke with vivacity, and drew a picture after her own dear heart, of\r\nthe pleasure we should bestow upon Lucy, and declared, if I went, she\r\nmust accompany me, and that she should very much dislike to entrust the\r\ncharge of rescuing them to others, who might fulfil it with coldness or\r\ninhumanity. Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s life had been one act of devotion and virtue; let\r\nher now reap the small reward of finding her excellence appreciated,\r\nand her necessity assisted, by those whom she respected and honoured.\r\n\r\nThese, and many other arguments, were urged with gentle pertinacity,\r\nand the ardour of a wish to do all the good in her power, by her whose\r\nsimple expression of a desire and slightest request had ever been a law\r\nwith me. I, of course, consented, the moment that I saw that she had\r\nset her heart upon this step. We sent half our attendant troop on to\r\nAdrian; and with the other half our carriage took a retrograde course\r\nback to Windsor.\r\n\r\nI wonder now how I could be so blind and senseless, as thus to risk the\r\nsafety of Idris; for, if I had eyes, surely I could see the sure,\r\nthough deceitful, advance of death in her burning cheek and encreasing\r\nweakness. But she said she was better; and I believed her. Extinction\r\ncould not be near a being, whose vivacity and intelligence hourly\r\nencreased, and whose frame was endowed with an intense, and I fondly\r\nthought, a strong and permanent spirit of life. Who, after a great\r\ndisaster, has not looked back with wonder at his inconceivable\r\nobtuseness of understanding, that could not perceive the many minute\r\nthreads with which fate weaves the inextricable net of our destinies,\r\nuntil he is inmeshed completely in it?\r\n\r\nThe cross roads which we now entered upon, were even in a worse state\r\nthan the long neglected high-ways; and the inconvenience seemed to\r\nmenace the perishing frame of Idris with destruction. Passing through\r\nDartford, we arrived at Hampton on the second day. Even in this short\r\ninterval my beloved companion grew sensibly worse in health, though her\r\nspirits were still light, and she cheered my growing anxiety with gay\r\nsallies; sometimes the thought pierced my brain\xe2\x80\x94Is she dying?\xe2\x80\x94as I saw\r\nher fair fleshless hand rest on mine, or observed the feebleness with\r\nwhich she performed the accustomed acts of life. I drove away the idea,\r\nas if it had been suggested by insanity; but it occurred again and\r\nagain, only to be dispelled by the continued liveliness of her manner.\r\n\r\nAbout mid-day, after quitting Hampton, our carriage broke down: the\r\nshock caused Idris to faint, but on her reviving no other ill\r\nconsequence ensued; our party of attendants had as usual gone on before\r\nus, and our coachman went in search of another vehicle, our former one\r\nbeing rendered by this accident unfit for service. The only place near\r\nus was a poor village, in which he found a kind of caravan, able to\r\nhold four people, but it was clumsy and ill hung; besides this he found\r\na very excellent cabriolet: our plan was soon arranged; I would drive\r\nIdris in the latter; while the children were conveyed by the servant in\r\nthe former. But these arrangements cost time; we had agreed to proceed\r\nthat night to Windsor, and thither our purveyors had gone: we should\r\nfind considerable difficulty in getting accommodation, before we\r\nreached this place; after all, the distance was only ten miles; my\r\nhorse was a good one; I would go forward at a good pace with Idris,\r\nleaving the children to follow at a rate more consonant to the uses of\r\ntheir cumberous machine.\r\n\r\nEvening closed in quickly, far more quickly than I was prepared to\r\nexpect. At the going down of the sun it began to snow heavily. I\r\nattempted in vain to defend my beloved companion from the storm; the\r\nwind drove the snow in our faces; and it lay so high on the ground,\r\nthat we made but small way; while the night was so dark, that but for\r\nthe white covering on the ground we should not have been able to see a\r\nyard before us. We had left our accompanying caravan far behind us; and\r\nnow I perceived that the storm had made me unconsciously deviate from\r\nmy intended route. I had gone some miles out of my way. My knowledge of\r\nthe country enabled me to regain the right road; but, instead of going,\r\nas at first agreed upon, by a cross road through Stanwell to Datchet, I\r\nwas obliged to take the way of Egham and Bishopgate. It was certain\r\ntherefore that I should not be rejoined by the other vehicle, that I\r\nshould not meet a single fellow-creature till we arrived at Windsor.\r\n\r\nThe back of our carriage was drawn up, and I hung a pelisse before it,\r\nthus to curtain the beloved sufferer from the pelting sleet. She leaned\r\non my shoulder, growing every moment more languid and feeble; at first\r\nshe replied to my words of cheer with affectionate thanks; but by\r\ndegrees she sunk into silence; her head lay heavily upon me; I only\r\nknew that she lived by her irregular breathing and frequent sighs. For\r\na moment I resolved to stop, and, opposing the back of the cabriolet to\r\nthe force of the tempest, to expect morning as well as I might. But the\r\nwind was bleak and piercing, while the occasional shudderings of my\r\npoor Idris, and the intense cold I felt myself, demonstrated that this\r\nwould be a dangerous experiment. At length methought she slept\xe2\x80\x94fatal\r\nsleep, induced by frost: at this moment I saw the heavy outline of a\r\ncottage traced on the dark horizon close to us: \xe2\x80\x9cDearest love,\xe2\x80\x9d I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csupport yourself but one moment, and we shall have shelter; let us\r\nstop here, that I may open the door of this blessed dwelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I spoke, my heart was transported, and my senses swam with excessive\r\ndelight and thankfulness; I placed the head of Idris against the\r\ncarriage, and, leaping out, scrambled through the snow to the cottage,\r\nwhose door was open. I had apparatus about me for procuring light, and\r\nthat shewed me a comfortable room, with a pile of wood in one corner,\r\nand no appearance of disorder, except that, the door having been left\r\npartly open, the snow, drifting in, had blocked up the threshold. I\r\nreturned to the carriage, and the sudden change from light to darkness\r\nat first blinded me. When I recovered my sight\xe2\x80\x94eternal God of this\r\nlawless world! O supreme Death! I will not disturb thy silent reign, or\r\nmar my tale with fruitless exclamations of horror\xe2\x80\x94I saw Idris, who had\r\nfallen from the seat to the bottom of the carriage; her head, its long\r\nhair pendent, with one arm, hung over the side.\xe2\x80\x94Struck by a spasm of\r\nhorror, I lifted her up; her heart was pulseless, her faded lips\r\nunfanned by the slightest breath.\r\n\r\nI carried her into the cottage; I placed her on the bed. Lighting a\r\nfire, I chafed her stiffening limbs; for two long hours I sought to\r\nrestore departed life; and, when hope was as dead as my beloved, I\r\nclosed with trembling hands her glazed eyes. I did not doubt what I\r\nshould now do. In the confusion attendant on my illness, the task of\r\ninterring our darling Alfred had devolved on his grandmother, the\r\nEx-Queen, and she, true to her ruling passion, had caused him to be\r\ncarried to Windsor, and buried in the family vault, in St. George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nChapel. I must proceed to Windsor, to calm the anxiety of Clara, who\r\nwould wait anxiously for us\xe2\x80\x94yet I would fain spare her the\r\nheart-breaking spectacle of Idris, brought in by me lifeless from the\r\njourney. So first I would place my beloved beside her child in the\r\nvault, and then seek the poor children who would be expecting me.\r\n\r\nI lighted the lamps of my carriage; I wrapt her in furs, and placed her\r\nalong the seat; then taking the reins, made the horses go forward. We\r\nproceeded through the snow, which lay in masses impeding the way, while\r\nthe descending flakes, driving against me with redoubled fury, blinded\r\nme. The pain occasioned by the angry elements, and the cold iron of the\r\nshafts of frost which buffetted me, and entered my aching flesh, were a\r\nrelief to me; blunting my mental suffering. The horses staggered on,\r\nand the reins hung loosely in my hands. I often thought I would lay my\r\nhead close to the sweet, cold face of my lost angel, and thus resign\r\nmyself to conquering torpor. Yet I must not leave her a prey to the\r\nfowls of the air; but, in pursuance of my determination place her in\r\nthe tomb of her forefathers, where a merciful God might permit me to\r\nrest also.\r\n\r\nThe road we passed through Egham was familiar to me; but the wind and\r\nsnow caused the horses to drag their load slowly and heavily. Suddenly\r\nthe wind veered from south-west to west, and then again to north-west.\r\nAs Sampson with tug and strain stirred from their bases the columns\r\nthat supported the Philistine temple, so did the gale shake the dense\r\nvapours propped on the horizon, while the massy dome of clouds fell to\r\nthe south, disclosing through the scattered web the clear empyrean, and\r\nthe little stars, which were set at an immeasurable distance in the\r\ncrystalline fields, showered their small rays on the glittering snow.\r\nEven the horses were cheered, and moved on with renovated strength. We\r\nentered the forest at Bishopgate, and at the end of the Long Walk I saw\r\nthe Castle, \xe2\x80\x9cthe proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of\r\nproportion, girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval\r\ntowers.\xe2\x80\x9d I looked with reverence on a structure, ancient almost as the\r\nrock on which it stood, abode of kings, theme of admiration for the\r\nwise. With greater reverence and, tearful affection I beheld it as the\r\nasylum of the long lease of love I had enjoyed there with the\r\nperishable, unmatchable treasure of dust, which now lay cold beside me.\r\nNow indeed, I could have yielded to all the softness of my nature, and\r\nwept; and, womanlike, have uttered bitter plaints; while the familiar\r\ntrees, the herds of living deer, the sward oft prest by her fairy-feet,\r\none by one with sad association presented themselves. The white gate at\r\nthe end of the Long Walk was wide open, and I rode up the empty town\r\nthrough the first gate of the feudal tower; and now St. George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nChapel, with its blackened fretted sides, was right before me. I halted\r\nat its door, which was open; I entered, and placed my lighted lamp on\r\nthe altar; then I returned, and with tender caution I bore Idris up the\r\naisle into the chancel, and laid her softly down on the carpet which\r\ncovered the step leading to the communion table. The banners of the\r\nknights of the garter, and their half drawn swords, were hung in vain\r\nemblazonry above the stalls. The banner of her family hung there, still\r\nsurmounted by its regal crown. Farewell to the glory and heraldry of\r\nEngland!\xe2\x80\x94I turned from such vanity with a slight feeling of wonder, at\r\nhow mankind could have ever been interested in such things. I bent over\r\nthe lifeless corpse of my beloved; and, while looking on her uncovered\r\nface, the features already contracted by the rigidity of death, I felt\r\nas if all the visible universe had grown as soulless, inane, and\r\ncomfortless as the clay-cold image beneath me. I felt for a moment the\r\nintolerable sense of struggle with, and detestation for, the laws which\r\ngovern the world; till the calm still visible on the face of my dead\r\nlove recalled me to a more soothing tone of mind, and I proceeded to\r\nfulfil the last office that could now be paid her. For her I could not\r\nlament, so much I envied her enjoyment of \xe2\x80\x9cthe sad immunities of the\r\ngrave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe vault had been lately opened to place our Alfred therein. The\r\nceremony customary in these latter days had been cursorily performed,\r\nand the pavement of the chapel, which was its entrance, having been\r\nremoved, had not been replaced. I descended the steps, and walked\r\nthrough the long passage to the large vault which contained the kindred\r\ndust of my Idris. I distinguished the small coffin of my babe. With\r\nhasty, trembling hands I constructed a bier beside it, spreading it\r\nwith the furs and Indian shawls, which had wrapt Idris in her journey\r\nthither. I lighted the glimmering lamp, which flickered in this damp\r\nabode of the dead; then I bore my lost one to her last bed, decently\r\ncomposing her limbs, and covering them with a mantle, veiling all\r\nexcept her face, which remained lovely and placid. She appeared to rest\r\nlike one over-wearied, her beauteous eyes steeped in sweet slumber.\r\nYet, so it was not\xe2\x80\x94she was dead! How intensely I then longed to lie\r\ndown beside her, to gaze till death should gather me to the same\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nBut death does not come at the bidding of the miserable. I had lately\r\nrecovered from mortal illness, and my blood had never flowed with such\r\nan even current, nor had my limbs ever been so instinct with quick\r\nlife, as now. I felt that my death must be voluntary. Yet what more\r\nnatural than famine, as I watched in this chamber of mortality, placed\r\nin a world of the dead, beside the lost hope of my life? Meanwhile as I\r\nlooked on her, the features, which bore a sisterly resemblance to\r\nAdrian, brought my thoughts back again to the living, to this dear\r\nfriend, to Clara, and to Evelyn, who were probably now in Windsor,\r\nwaiting anxiously for our arrival.\r\n\r\nMethought I heard a noise, a step in the far chapel, which was\r\nre-echoed by its vaulted roof, and borne to me through the hollow\r\npassages. Had Clara seen my carriage pass up the town, and did she seek\r\nme here? I must save her at least from the horrible scene the vault\r\npresented. I sprung up the steps, and then saw a female figure, bent\r\nwith age, and clad in long mourning robes, advance through the dusky\r\nchapel, supported by a slender cane, yet tottering even with this\r\nsupport. She heard me, and looked up; the lamp I held illuminated my\r\nfigure, and the moon-beams, struggling through the painted glass, fell\r\nupon her face, wrinkled and gaunt, yet with a piercing eye and\r\ncommanding brow\xe2\x80\x94I recognized the Countess of Windsor. With a hollow\r\nvoice she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the princess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pointed to the torn up pavement: she walked to the spot, and looked\r\ndown into the palpable darkness; for the vault was too distant for the\r\nrays of the small lamp I had left there to be discernible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour light,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. I gave it her; and she regarded the now\r\nvisible, but precipitous steps, as if calculating her capacity to\r\ndescend. Instinctively I made a silent offer of my assistance. She\r\nmotioned me away with a look of scorn, saying in an harsh voice, as she\r\npointed downwards, \xe2\x80\x9cThere at least I may have her undisturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked deliberately down, while I, overcome, miserable beyond\r\nwords, or tears, or groans, threw myself on the pavement near\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nstiffening form of Idris was before me, the death-struck countenance\r\nhushed in eternal repose beneath. That was to me the end of all! The\r\nday before, I had figured to my self various adventures, and communion\r\nwith my friends in after time\xe2\x80\x94now I had leapt the interval, and reached\r\nthe utmost edge and bourne of life. Thus wrapt in gloom, enclosed,\r\nwalled up, vaulted over by the omnipotent present, I was startled by\r\nthe sound of feet on the steps of the tomb, and I remembered her whom I\r\nhad utterly forgotten, my angry visitant; her tall form slowly rose\r\nupwards from the vault, a living statue, instinct with hate, and human,\r\npassionate strife: she seemed to me as having reached the pavement of\r\nthe aisle; she stood motionless, seeking with her eyes alone, some\r\ndesired object\xe2\x80\x94till, perceiving me close to her, she placed her\r\nwrinkled hand on my arm, exclaiming with tremulous accents, \xe2\x80\x9cLionel\r\nVerney, my son!\xe2\x80\x9d This name, applied at such a moment by my angel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother, instilled into me more respect than I had ever before felt for\r\nthis disdainful lady. I bowed my head, and kissed her shrivelled hand,\r\nand, remarking that she trembled violently, supported her to the end of\r\nthe chancel, where she sat on the steps that led to the regal stall.\r\nShe suffered herself to be led, and still holding my hand, she leaned\r\nher head back against the stall, while the moon beams, tinged with\r\nvarious colours by the painted glass, fell on her glistening eyes;\r\naware of her weakness, again calling to mind her long cherished\r\ndignity, she dashed the tears away; yet they fell fast, as she said,\r\nfor excuse, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is so beautiful and placid, even in death. No harsh\r\nfeeling ever clouded her serene brow; how did I treat her? wounding her\r\ngentle heart with savage coldness; I had no compassion on her in past\r\nyears, does she forgive me now? Little, little does it boot to talk of\r\nrepentance and forgiveness to the dead, had I during her life once\r\nconsulted her gentle wishes, and curbed my rugged nature to do her\r\npleasure, I should not feel thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIdris and her mother were unlike in person. The dark hair, deep-set\r\nblack eyes, and prominent features of the Ex-Queen were in entire\r\ncontrast to the golden tresses, the full blue orbs, and the soft lines\r\nand contour of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s countenance. Yet, in latter days, illness\r\nhad taken from my poor girl the full outline of her face, and reduced\r\nit to the inflexible shape of the bone beneath. In the form of her\r\nbrow, in her oval chin, there was to be found a resemblance to her\r\nmother; nay in some moods, their gestures were not unlike; nor, having\r\nlived so long together, was this wonderful.\r\n\r\nThere is a magic power in resemblance. When one we love dies, we hope\r\nto see them in another state, and half expect that the agency of mind\r\nwill inform its new garb in imitation of its decayed earthly vesture.\r\nBut these are ideas of the mind only. We know that the instrument is\r\nshivered, the sensible image lies in miserable fragments, dissolved to\r\ndusty nothingness; a look, a gesture, or a fashioning of the limbs\r\nsimilar to the dead in a living person, touches a thrilling chord,\r\nwhose sacred harmony is felt in the heart\xe2\x80\x99s dearest recess. Strangely\r\nmoved, prostrate before this spectral image, and enslaved by the force\r\nof blood manifested in likeness of look and movement, I remained\r\ntrembling in the presence of the harsh, proud, and till now unloved\r\nmother of Idris.\r\n\r\nPoor, mistaken woman! in her tenderest mood before, she had cherished\r\nthe idea, that a word, a look of reconciliation from her, would be\r\nreceived with joy, and repay long years of severity. Now that the time\r\nwas gone for the exercise of such power, she fell at once upon the\r\nthorny truth of things, and felt that neither smile nor caress could\r\npenetrate to the unconscious state, or influence the happiness of her\r\nwho lay in the vault beneath. This conviction, together with the\r\nremembrance of soft replies to bitter speeches, of gentle looks\r\nrepaying angry glances; the perception of the falsehood, paltryness and\r\nfutility of her cherished dreams of birth and power; the overpowering\r\nknowledge, that love and life were the true emperors of our mortal\r\nstate; all, as a tide, rose, and filled her soul with stormy and\r\nbewildering confusion. It fell to my lot, to come as the influential\r\npower, to allay the fierce tossing of these tumultuous waves. I spoke\r\nto her; I led her to reflect how happy Idris had really been, and how\r\nher virtues and numerous excellencies had found scope and estimation in\r\nher past career. I praised her, the idol of my heart\xe2\x80\x99s dear worship,\r\nthe admired type of feminine perfection. With ardent and overflowing\r\neloquence, I relieved my heart from its burthen, and awoke to the sense\r\nof a new pleasure in life, as I poured forth the funeral eulogy. Then I\r\nreferred to Adrian, her loved brother, and to her surviving child. I\r\ndeclared, which I had before almost forgotten, what my duties were with\r\nregard to these valued portions of herself, and bade the melancholy\r\nrepentant mother reflect, how she could best expiate unkindness towards\r\nthe dead, by redoubled love of the survivors. Consoling her, my own\r\nsorrows were assuaged; my sincerity won her entire conviction.\r\n\r\nShe turned to me. The hard, inflexible, persecuting woman, turned with\r\na mild expression of face, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf our beloved angel sees us now,\r\nit will delight her to find that I do you even tardy justice. You were\r\nworthy of her; and from my heart I am glad that you won her away from\r\nme. Pardon, my son, the many wrongs I have done you; forget my bitter\r\nwords and unkind treatment\xe2\x80\x94take me, and govern me as you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI seized this docile moment to propose our departure from the church.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9clet us replace the pavement above the vault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe drew near to it; \xe2\x80\x9cShall we look on her again?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand, I pray you, neither do you. We need not\r\ntorture ourselves by gazing on the soulless body, while her living\r\nspirit is buried quick in our hearts, and her surpassing loveliness is\r\nso deeply carved there, that sleeping or waking she must ever be\r\npresent to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a few moments, we bent in solemn silence over the open vault. I\r\nconsecrated my future life, to the embalming of her dear memory; I\r\nvowed to serve her brother and her child till death. The convulsive sob\r\nof my companion made me break off my internal orisons. I next dragged\r\nthe stones over the entrance of the tomb, and closed the gulph that\r\ncontained the life of my life. Then, supporting my decrepid\r\nfellow-mourner, we slowly left the chapel. I felt, as I stepped into\r\nthe open air, as if I had quitted an happy nest of repose, for a dreary\r\nwilderness, a tortuous path, a bitter, joyless, hopeless pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur escort had been directed to prepare our abode for the night at the\r\ninn, opposite the ascent to the Castle. We could not again visit the\r\nhalls and familiar chambers of our home, on a mere visit. We had\r\nalready left for ever the glades of Windsor, and all of coppice,\r\nflowery hedgerow, and murmuring stream, which gave shape and intensity\r\nto the love of our country, and the almost superstitious attachment\r\nwith which we regarded native England. It had been our intention to\r\nhave called at Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling in Datchet, and to have re-assured her\r\nwith promises of aid and protection before we repaired to our quarters\r\nfor the night. Now, as the Countess of Windsor and I turned down the\r\nsteep hill that led from the Castle, we saw the children, who had just\r\nstopped in their caravan, at the inn-door. They had passed through\r\nDatchet without halting. I dreaded to meet them, and to be the bearer\r\nof my tragic story, so while they were still occupied in the hurry of\r\narrival, I suddenly left them, and through the snow and clear\r\nmoon-light air, hastened along the well known road to Datchet.\r\n\r\nWell known indeed it was. Each cottage stood on its accustomed site,\r\neach tree wore its familiar appearance. Habit had graven uneraseably on\r\nmy memory, every turn and change of object on the road. At a short\r\ndistance beyond the Little Park, was an elm half blown down by a storm,\r\nsome ten years ago; and still, with leafless snow-laden branches, it\r\nstretched across the pathway, which wound through a meadow, beside a\r\nshallow brook, whose brawling was silenced by frost\xe2\x80\x94that stile, that\r\nwhite gate, that hollow oak tree, which doubtless once belonged to the\r\nforest, and which now shewed in the moonlight its gaping rent; to whose\r\nfanciful appearance, tricked out by the dusk into a resemblance of the\r\nhuman form, the children had given the name of Falstaff;\xe2\x80\x94all these\r\nobjects were as well known to me as the cold hearth of my deserted\r\nhome, and every moss-grown wall and plot of orchard ground, alike as\r\ntwin lambs are to each other in a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s eye, yet to my accustomed\r\ngaze bore differences, distinction, and a name. England remained,\r\nthough England was dead\xe2\x80\x94it was the ghost of merry England that I\r\nbeheld, under those greenwood shade passing generations had sported in\r\nsecurity and ease. To this painful recognition of familiar places, was\r\nadded a feeling experienced by all, understood by none\xe2\x80\x94a feeling as if\r\nin some state, less visionary than a dream, in some past real\r\nexistence, I had seen all I saw, with precisely the same feelings as I\r\nnow beheld them\xe2\x80\x94as if all my sensations were a duplex mirror of a\r\nformer revelation. To get rid of this oppressive sense I strove to\r\nimagine change in this tranquil spot\xe2\x80\x94this augmented my mood, by causing\r\nme to bestow more attention on the objects which occasioned me pain.\r\n\r\nI reached Datchet and Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s humble abode\xe2\x80\x94once noisy with Saturday\r\nnight revellers, or trim and neat on Sunday morning it had borne\r\ntestimony to the labours and orderly habits of the housewife. The snow\r\nlay high about the door, as if it had remained unclosed for many days.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhat scene of death hath Roscius now to act?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI muttered to myself as I looked at the dark casements. At first I\r\nthought I saw a light in one of them, but it proved to be merely the\r\nrefraction of the moon-beams, while the only sound was the crackling\r\nbranches as the breeze whirred the snow flakes from them\xe2\x80\x94the moon\r\nsailed high and unclouded in the interminable ether, while the shadow\r\nof the cottage lay black on the garden behind. I entered this by the\r\nopen wicket, and anxiously examined each window. At length I detected a\r\nray of light struggling through a closed shutter in one of the upper\r\nrooms\xe2\x80\x94it was a novel feeling, alas! to look at any house and say there\r\ndwells its usual inmate\xe2\x80\x94the door of the house was merely on the latch:\r\nso I entered and ascended the moon-lit staircase. The door of the\r\ninhabited room was ajar: looking in, I saw Lucy sitting as at work at\r\nthe table on which the light stood; the implements of needlework were\r\nabout her, but her hand had fallen on her lap, and her eyes, fixed on\r\nthe ground, shewed by their vacancy that her thoughts wandered. Traces\r\nof care and watching had diminished her former attractions\xe2\x80\x94but her\r\nsimple dress and cap, her desponding attitude, and the single candle\r\nthat cast its light upon her, gave for a moment a picturesque grouping\r\nto the whole. A fearful reality recalled me from the thought\xe2\x80\x94a figure\r\nlay stretched on the bed covered by a sheet\xe2\x80\x94her mother was dead, and\r\nLucy, apart from all the world, deserted and alone, watched beside the\r\ncorpse during the weary night. I entered the room, and my unexpected\r\nappearance at first drew a scream from the lone survivor of a dead\r\nnation; but she recognised me, and recovered herself, with the quick\r\nexercise of self-control habitual to her. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you not expect me?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked, in that low voice which the presence of the dead makes us as it\r\nwere instinctively assume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, \xe2\x80\x9cto have come yourself; I can never\r\nthank you sufficiently; but it is too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you mean? It is not too late to take you\r\nfrom this deserted place, and conduct you to\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy own loss, which I had forgotten as I spoke, now made me turn away,\r\nwhile choking grief impeded my speech. I threw open the window, and\r\nlooked on the cold, waning, ghastly, misshaped circle on high, and the\r\nchill white earth beneath\xe2\x80\x94did the spirit of sweet Idris sail along the\r\nmoon-frozen crystal air?\xe2\x80\x94No, no, a more genial atmosphere, a lovelier\r\nhabitation was surely hers!\r\n\r\nI indulged in this meditation for a moment, and then again addressed\r\nthe mourner, who stood leaning against the bed with that expression of\r\nresigned despair, of complete misery, and a patient sufferance of it,\r\nwhich is far more touching than any of the insane ravings or wild\r\ngesticulation of untamed sorrow. I desired to draw her from this spot;\r\nbut she opposed my wish. That class of persons whose imagination and\r\nsensibility have never been taken out of the narrow circle immediately\r\nin view, if they possess these qualities to any extent, are apt to pour\r\ntheir influence into the very realities which appear to destroy them,\r\nand to cling to these with double tenacity from not being able to\r\ncomprehend any thing beyond. Thus Lucy, in desert England, in a dead\r\nworld, wished to fulfil the usual ceremonies of the dead, such as were\r\ncustomary to the English country people, when death was a rare\r\nvisitant, and gave us time to receive his dreaded usurpation with pomp\r\nand circumstance\xe2\x80\x94going forth in procession to deliver the keys of the\r\ntomb into his conquering hand. She had already, alone as she was,\r\naccomplished some of these, and the work on which I found her employed,\r\nwas her mother\xe2\x80\x99s shroud. My heart sickened at such detail of woe, which\r\na female can endure, but which is more painful to the masculine spirit\r\nthan deadliest struggle, or throes of unutterable but transient agony.\r\n\r\nThis must not be, I told her; and then, as further inducement, I\r\ncommunicated to her my recent loss, and gave her the idea that she must\r\ncome with me to take charge of the orphan children, whom the death of\r\nIdris had deprived of a mother\xe2\x80\x99s care. Lucy never resisted the call of\r\na duty, so she yielded, and closing the casements and doors with care,\r\nshe accompanied me back to Windsor. As we went she communicated to me\r\nthe occasion of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death. Either by some mischance she had\r\ngot sight of Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s letter to Idris, or she had overheard her\r\nconversation with the countryman who bore it; however it might be, she\r\nobtained a knowledge of the appalling situation of herself and her\r\ndaughter, her aged frame could not sustain the anxiety and horror this\r\ndiscovery instilled\xe2\x80\x94she concealed her knowledge from Lucy, but brooded\r\nover it through sleepless nights, till fever and delirium, swift\r\nforerunners of death, disclosed the secret. Her life, which had long\r\nbeen hovering on its extinction, now yielded at once to the united\r\neffects of misery and sickness, and that same morning she had died.\r\n\r\nAfter the tumultuous emotions of the day, I was glad to find on my\r\narrival at the inn that my companions had retired to rest. I gave Lucy\r\nin charge to the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s attendant, and then sought repose from my\r\nvarious struggles and impatient regrets. For a few moments the events\r\nof the day floated in disastrous pageant through my brain, till sleep\r\nbathed it in forgetfulness; when morning dawned and I awoke, it seemed\r\nas if my slumber had endured for years.\r\n\r\nMy companions had not shared my oblivion. Clara\xe2\x80\x99s swollen eyes shewed\r\nthat she had passed the night in weeping. The Countess looked haggard\r\nand wan. Her firm spirit had not found relief in tears, and she\r\nsuffered the more from all the painful retrospect and agonizing regret\r\nthat now occupied her. We departed from Windsor, as soon as the burial\r\nrites had been performed for Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s mother, and, urged on by an\r\nimpatient desire to change the scene, went forward towards Dover with\r\nspeed, our escort having gone before to provide horses; finding them\r\neither in the warm stables they instinctively sought during the cold\r\nweather, or standing shivering in the bleak fields ready to surrender\r\ntheir liberty in exchange for offered corn.\r\n\r\nDuring our ride the Countess recounted to me the extraordinary\r\ncircumstances which had brought her so strangely to my side in the\r\nchancel of St. George\xe2\x80\x99s chapel. When last she had taken leave of Idris,\r\nas she looked anxiously on her faded person and pallid countenance, she\r\nhad suddenly been visited by a conviction that she saw her for the last\r\ntime. It was hard to part with her while under the dominion of this\r\nsentiment, and for the last time she endeavoured to persuade her\r\ndaughter to commit herself to her nursing, permitting me to join\r\nAdrian. Idris mildly refused, and thus they separated. The idea that\r\nthey should never again meet grew on the Countess\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and haunted\r\nher perpetually; a thousand times she had resolved to turn back and\r\njoin us, and was again and again restrained by the pride and anger of\r\nwhich she was the slave. Proud of heart as she was, she bathed her\r\npillow with nightly tears, and through the day was subdued by nervous\r\nagitation and expectation of the dreaded event, which she was wholly\r\nincapable of curbing. She confessed that at this period her hatred of\r\nme knew no bounds, since she considered me as the sole obstacle to the\r\nfulfilment of her dearest wish, that of attending upon her daughter in\r\nher last moments. She desired to express her fears to her son, and to\r\nseek consolation from his sympathy with, or courage from his rejection\r\nof, her auguries.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of her arrival at Dover she walked with him on the sea\r\nbeach, and with the timidity characteristic of passionate and\r\nexaggerated feeling was by degrees bringing the conversation to the\r\ndesired point, when she could communicate her fears to him, when the\r\nmessenger who bore my letter announcing our temporary return to\r\nWindsor, came riding down to them. He gave some oral account of how he\r\nhad left us, and added, that notwithstanding the cheerfulness and good\r\ncourage of Lady Idris, he was afraid that she would hardly reach\r\nWindsor alive. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Countess, \xe2\x80\x9cyour fears are just, she is\r\nabout to expire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, her eyes were fixed on a tomblike hollow of the cliff,\r\nand she saw, she averred the same to me with solemnity, Idris pacing\r\nslowly towards this cave. She was turned from her, her head was bent\r\ndown, her white dress was such as she was accustomed to wear, except\r\nthat a thin crape-like veil covered her golden tresses, and concealed\r\nher as a dim transparent mist. She looked dejected, as docilely\r\nyielding to a commanding power; she submissively entered, and was lost\r\nin the dark recess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere I subject to visionary moods,\xe2\x80\x9d said the venerable lady, as she\r\ncontinued her narrative, \xe2\x80\x9cI might doubt my eyes, and condemn my\r\ncredulity; but reality is the world I live in, and what I saw I doubt\r\nnot had existence beyond myself. From that moment I could not rest; it\r\nwas worth my existence to see her once again before she died; I knew\r\nthat I should not accomplish this, yet I must endeavour. I immediately\r\ndeparted for Windsor; and, though I was assured that we travelled\r\nspeedily, it seemed to me that our progress was snail-like, and that\r\ndelays were created solely for my annoyance. Still I accused you, and\r\nheaped on your head the fiery ashes of my burning impatience. It was no\r\ndisappointment, though an agonizing pang, when you pointed to her last\r\nabode; and words would ill express the abhorrence I that moment felt\r\ntowards you, the triumphant impediment to my dearest wishes. I saw her,\r\nand anger, and hate, and injustice died at her bier, giving place at\r\ntheir departure to a remorse (Great God, that I should feel it!) which\r\nmust last while memory and feeling endure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo medicine such remorse, to prevent awakening love and new-born\r\nmildness from producing the same bitter fruit that hate and harshness\r\nhad done, I devoted all my endeavours to soothe the venerable penitent.\r\nOur party was a melancholy one; each was possessed by regret for what\r\nwas remediless; for the absence of his mother shadowed even the infant\r\ngaiety of Evelyn. Added to this was the prospect of the uncertain\r\nfuture. Before the final accomplishment of any great voluntary change\r\nthe mind vacillates, now soothing itself by fervent expectation, now\r\nrecoiling from obstacles which seem never to have presented themselves\r\nbefore with so frightful an aspect. An involuntary tremor ran through\r\nme when I thought that in another day we might have crossed the watery\r\nbarrier, and have set forward on that hopeless, interminable, sad\r\nwandering, which but a short time before I regarded as the only relief\r\nto sorrow that our situation afforded.\r\n\r\nOur approach to Dover was announced by the loud roarings of the wintry\r\nsea. They were borne miles inland by the sound-laden blast, and by\r\ntheir unaccustomed uproar, imparted a feeling of insecurity and peril\r\nto our stable abode. At first we hardly permitted ourselves to think\r\nthat any unusual eruption of nature caused this tremendous war of air\r\nand water, but rather fancied that we merely listened to what we had\r\nheard a thousand times before, when we had watched the flocks of\r\nfleece-crowned waves, driven by the winds, come to lament and die on\r\nthe barren sands and pointed rocks. But we found upon advancing\r\nfarther, that Dover was overflowed\xe2\x80\x94 many of the houses were overthrown\r\nby the surges which filled the streets, and with hideous brawlings\r\nsometimes retreated leaving the pavement of the town bare, till again\r\nhurried forward by the influx of ocean, they returned with\r\nthunder-sound to their usurped station.\r\n\r\nHardly less disturbed than the tempestuous world of waters was the\r\nassembly of human beings, that from the cliff fearfully watched its\r\nravings. On the morning of the arrival of the emigrants under the\r\nconduct of Adrian, the sea had been serene and glassy, the slight\r\nripples refracted the sunbeams, which shed their radiance through the\r\nclear blue frosty air. This placid appearance of nature was hailed as a\r\ngood augury for the voyage, and the chief immediately repaired to the\r\nharbour to examine two steamboats which were moored there. On the\r\nfollowing midnight, when all were at rest, a frightful storm of wind\r\nand clattering rain and hail first disturbed them, and the voice of one\r\nshrieking in the streets, that the sleepers must awake or they would be\r\ndrowned; and when they rushed out, half clothed, to discover the\r\nmeaning of this alarm, they found that the tide, rising above every\r\nmark, was rushing into the town. They ascended the cliff, but the\r\ndarkness permitted only the white crest of waves to be seen, while the\r\nroaring wind mingled its howlings in dire accord with the wild surges.\r\nThe awful hour of night, the utter inexperience of many who had never\r\nseen the sea before, the wailing of women and cries of children added\r\nto the horror of the tumult. All the following day the same scene\r\ncontinued. When the tide ebbed, the town was left dry; but on its flow,\r\nit rose even higher than on the preceding night. The vast ships that\r\nlay rotting in the roads were whirled from their anchorage, and driven\r\nand jammed against the cliff, the vessels in the harbour were flung on\r\nland like sea-weed, and there battered to pieces by the breakers. The\r\nwaves dashed against the cliff, which if in any place it had been\r\nbefore loosened, now gave way, and the affrighted crowd saw vast\r\nfragments of the near earth fall with crash and roar into the deep.\r\nThis sight operated differently on different persons. The greater part\r\nthought it a judgment of God, to prevent or punish our emigration from\r\nour native land. Many were doubly eager to quit a nook of ground now\r\nbecome their prison, which appeared unable to resist the inroads of\r\nocean\xe2\x80\x99s giant waves.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Dover, after a fatiguing day\xe2\x80\x99s journey, we all\r\nrequired rest and sleep; but the scene acting around us soon drove away\r\nsuch ideas. We were drawn, along with the greater part of our\r\ncompanions, to the edge of the cliff, there to listen to and make a\r\nthousand conjectures. A fog narrowed our horizon to about a quarter of\r\na mile, and the misty veil, cold and dense, enveloped sky and sea in\r\nequal obscurity. What added to our inquietude was the circumstance that\r\ntwo-thirds of our original number were now waiting for us in Paris, and\r\nclinging, as we now did most painfully, to any addition to our\r\nmelancholy remnant, this division, with the tameless impassable ocean\r\nbetween, struck us with affright. At length, after loitering for\r\nseveral hours on the cliff, we retired to Dover Castle, whose roof\r\nsheltered all who breathed the English air, and sought the sleep\r\nnecessary to restore strength and courage to our worn frames and\r\nlanguid spirits.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning Adrian brought me the welcome intelligence that\r\nthe wind had changed: it had been south-west; it was now north-east.\r\nThe sky was stripped bare of clouds by the increasing gale, while the\r\ntide at its ebb seceded entirely from the town. The change of wind\r\nrather increased the fury of the sea, but it altered its late dusky hue\r\nto a bright green; and in spite of its unmitigated clamour, its more\r\ncheerful appearance instilled hope and pleasure. All day we watched the\r\nranging of the mountainous waves, and towards sunset a desire to\r\ndecypher the promise for the morrow at its setting, made us all gather\r\nwith one accord on the edge of the cliff. When the mighty luminary\r\napproached within a few degrees of the tempest-tossed horizon,\r\nsuddenly, a wonder! three other suns, alike burning and brilliant,\r\nrushed from various quarters of the heavens towards the great orb; they\r\nwhirled round it. The glare of light was intense to our dazzled eyes;\r\nthe sun itself seemed to join in the dance, while the sea burned like a\r\nfurnace, like all Vesuvius a-light, with flowing lava beneath. The\r\nhorses broke loose from their stalls in terror\xe2\x80\x94a herd of cattle, panic\r\nstruck, raced down to the brink of the cliff, and blinded by light,\r\nplunged down with frightful yells in the waves below. The time occupied\r\nby the apparition of these meteors was comparatively short; suddenly\r\nthe three mock suns united in one, and plunged into the sea. A few\r\nseconds afterwards, a deafening watery sound came up with awful peal\r\nfrom the spot where they had disappeared.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun, disencumbered from his strange satellites, paced\r\nwith its accustomed majesty towards its western home. When\xe2\x80\x94we dared not\r\ntrust our eyes late dazzled, but it seemed that\xe2\x80\x94the sea rose to meet\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94it mounted higher and higher, till the fiery globe was obscured, and\r\nthe wall of water still ascended the horizon; it appeared as if\r\nsuddenly the motion of earth was revealed to us\xe2\x80\x94as if no longer we were\r\nruled by ancient laws, but were turned adrift in an unknown region of\r\nspace. Many cried aloud, that these were no meteors, but globes of\r\nburning matter, which had set fire to the earth, and caused the vast\r\ncauldron at our feet to bubble up with its measureless waves; the day\r\nof judgment was come they averred, and a few moments would transport us\r\nbefore the awful countenance of the omnipotent judge; while those less\r\ngiven to visionary terrors, declared that two conflicting gales had\r\noccasioned the last phaenomenon. In support of this opinion they\r\npointed out the fact that the east wind died away, while the rushing of\r\nthe coming west mingled its wild howl with the roar of the advancing\r\nwaters. Would the cliff resist this new battery? Was not the giant wave\r\nfar higher than the precipice? Would not our little island be deluged\r\nby its approach? The crowd of spectators fled. They were dispersed over\r\nthe fields, stopping now and then, and looking back in terror. A\r\nsublime sense of awe calmed the swift pulsations of my heart\xe2\x80\x94I awaited\r\nthe approach of the destruction menaced, with that solemn resignation\r\nwhich an unavoidable necessity instils. The ocean every moment assumed\r\na more terrific aspect, while the twilight was dimmed by the rack which\r\nthe west wind spread over the sky. By slow degrees however, as the wave\r\nadvanced, it took a more mild appearance; some under current of air, or\r\nobstruction in the bed of the waters, checked its progress, and it sank\r\ngradually; while the surface of the sea became uniformly higher as it\r\ndissolved into it. This change took from us the fear of an immediate\r\ncatastrophe, although we were still anxious as to the final result. We\r\ncontinued during the whole night to watch the fury of the sea and the\r\npace of the driving clouds, through whose openings the rare stars\r\nrushed impetuously; the thunder of conflicting elements deprived us of\r\nall power to sleep.\r\n\r\nThis endured ceaselessly for three days and nights. The stoutest hearts\r\nquailed before the savage enmity of nature; provisions began to fail\r\nus, though every day foraging parties were dispersed to the nearer\r\ntowns. In vain we schooled ourselves into the belief, that there was\r\nnothing out of the common order of nature in the strife we witnessed;\r\nour disasterous and overwhelming destiny turned the best of us to\r\ncowards. Death had hunted us through the course of many months, even to\r\nthe narrow strip of time on which we now stood; narrow indeed, and\r\nbuffeted by storms, was our footway overhanging the great sea of\r\ncalamity\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n        As an unsheltered northern shore\r\nIs shaken by the wintry wave\xe2\x80\x94\r\nAnd frequent storms for evermore,\r\n(While from the west the loud winds rave,\r\nOr from the east, or mountains hoar)\r\nThe struck and tott\xe2\x80\x99ring sand-bank lave.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt required more than human energy to bear up against the menaces of\r\ndestruction that every where surrounded us.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of three days, the gale died away, the sea-gull sailed\r\nupon the calm bosom of the windless atmosphere, and the last yellow\r\nleaf on the topmost branch of the oak hung without motion. The sea no\r\nlonger broke with fury; but a swell setting in steadily for shore, with\r\nlong sweep and sullen burst replaced the roar of the breakers. Yet we\r\nderived hope from the change, and we did not doubt that after the\r\ninterval of a few days the sea would resume its tranquillity. The\r\nsunset of the fourth day favoured this idea; it was clear and golden.\r\nAs we gazed on the purple sea, radiant beneath, we were attracted by a\r\nnovel spectacle; a dark speck\xe2\x80\x94as it neared, visibly a boat\xe2\x80\x94rode on the\r\ntop of the waves, every now and then lost in the steep vallies between.\r\nWe marked its course with eager questionings; and, when we saw that it\r\nevidently made for shore, we descended to the only practicable landing\r\nplace, and hoisted a signal to direct them. By the help of glasses we\r\ndistinguished her crew; it consisted of nine men, Englishmen, belonging\r\nin truth to the two divisions of our people, who had preceded us, and\r\nhad been for several weeks at Paris. As countryman was wont to meet\r\ncountryman in distant lands, did we greet our visitors on their\r\nlanding, with outstretched hands and gladsome welcome. They were slow\r\nto reciprocate our gratulations. They looked angry and resentful; not\r\nless than the chafed sea which they had traversed with imminent peril,\r\nthough apparently more displeased with each other than with us. It was\r\nstrange to see these human beings, who appeared to be given forth by\r\nthe earth like rare and inestimable plants, full of towering passion,\r\nand the spirit of angry contest. Their first demand was to be conducted\r\nto the Lord Protector of England, so they called Adrian, though he had\r\nlong discarded the empty title, as a bitter mockery of the shadow to\r\nwhich the Protectorship was now reduced. They were speedily led to\r\nDover Castle, from whose keep Adrian had watched the movements of the\r\nboat. He received them with the interest and wonder so strange a\r\nvisitation created. In the confusion occasioned by their angry demands\r\nfor precedence, it was long before we could discover the secret meaning\r\nof this strange scene. By degrees, from the furious declamations of\r\none, the fierce interruptions of another, and the bitter scoffs of a\r\nthird, we found that they were deputies from our colony at Paris, from\r\nthree parties there formed, who, each with angry rivalry, tried to\r\nattain a superiority over the other two. These deputies had been\r\ndispatched by them to Adrian, who had been selected arbiter; and they\r\nhad journied from Paris to Calais, through the vacant towns and\r\ndesolate country, indulging the while violent hatred against each\r\nother; and now they pleaded their several causes with unmitigated\r\nparty-spirit.\r\n\r\nBy examining the deputies apart, and after much investigation, we\r\nlearnt the true state of things at Paris. Since parliament had elected\r\nhim Ryland\xe2\x80\x99s deputy, all the surviving English had submitted to Adrian.\r\nHe was our captain to lead us from our native soil to unknown lands,\r\nour lawgiver and our preserver. On the first arrangement of our scheme\r\nof emigration, no continued separation of our members was contemplated,\r\nand the command of the whole body in gradual ascent of power had its\r\napex in the Earl of Windsor. But unforeseen circumstances changed our\r\nplans for us, and occasioned the greater part of our numbers to be\r\ndivided for the space of nearly two months, from the supreme chief.\r\nThey had gone over in two distinct bodies; and on their arrival at\r\nParis dissension arose between them.\r\n\r\nThey had found Paris a desert. When first the plague had appeared, the\r\nreturn of travellers and merchants, and communications by letter,\r\ninformed us regularly of the ravages made by disease on the continent.\r\nBut with the encreased mortality this intercourse declined and ceased.\r\nEven in England itself communication from one part of the island to the\r\nother became slow and rare. No vessel stemmed the flood that divided\r\nCalais from Dover; or if some melancholy voyager, wishing to assure\r\nhimself of the life or death of his relatives, put from the French\r\nshore to return among us, often the greedy ocean swallowed his little\r\ncraft, or after a day or two he was infected by the disorder, and died\r\nbefore he could tell the tale of the desolation of France. We were\r\ntherefore to a great degree ignorant of the state of things on the\r\ncontinent, and were not without some vague hope of finding numerous\r\ncompanions in its wide track. But the same causes that had so fearfully\r\ndiminished the English nation had had even greater scope for mischief\r\nin the sister land. France was a blank; during the long line of road\r\nfrom Calais to Paris not one human being was found. In Paris there were\r\na few, perhaps a hundred, who, resigned to their coming fate, flitted\r\nabout the streets of the capital and assembled to converse of past\r\ntimes, with that vivacity and even gaiety that seldom deserts the\r\nindividuals of this nation.\r\n\r\nThe English took uncontested possession of Paris. Its high houses and\r\nnarrow streets were lifeless. A few pale figures were to be\r\ndistinguished at the accustomed resort at the Tuileries; they wondered\r\nwherefore the islanders should approach their ill-fated city\xe2\x80\x94for in the\r\nexcess of wretchedness, the sufferers always imagine, that their part\r\nof the calamity is the bitterest, as, when enduring intense pain, we\r\nwould exchange the particular torture we writhe under, for any other\r\nwhich should visit a different part of the frame. They listened to the\r\naccount the emigrants gave of their motives for leaving their native\r\nland, with a shrug almost of disdain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cReturn,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9creturn to\r\nyour island, whose sea breezes, and division from the continent gives\r\nsome promise of health; if Pestilence among you has slain its hundreds,\r\nwith us it has slain its thousands. Are you not even now more numerous\r\nthan we are?\xe2\x80\x94A year ago you would have found only the sick burying the\r\ndead; now we are happier; for the pang of struggle has passed away, and\r\nthe few you find here are patiently waiting the final blow. But you,\r\nwho are not content to die, breathe no longer the air of France, or\r\nsoon you will only be a part of her soil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus, by menaces of the sword, they would have driven back those who\r\nhad escaped from fire. But the peril left behind was deemed imminent by\r\nmy countrymen; that before them doubtful and distant; and soon other\r\nfeelings arose to obliterate fear, or to replace it by passions, that\r\nought to have had no place among a brotherhood of unhappy survivors of\r\nthe expiring world.\r\n\r\nThe more numerous division of emigrants, which arrived first at Paris,\r\nassumed a superiority of rank and power; the second party asserted\r\ntheir independence. A third was formed by a sectarian, a self-erected\r\nprophet, who, while he attributed all power and rule to God, strove to\r\nget the real command of his comrades into his own hands. This third\r\ndivision consisted of fewest individuals, but their purpose was more\r\none, their obedience to their leader more entire, their fortitude and\r\ncourage more unyielding and active.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole progress of the plague, the teachers of religion were\r\nin possession of great power; a power of good, if rightly directed, or\r\nof incalculable mischief, if fanaticism or intolerance guided their\r\nefforts. In the present instance, a worse feeling than either of these\r\nactuated the leader. He was an impostor in the most determined sense of\r\nthe term. A man who had in early life lost, through the indulgence of\r\nvicious propensities, all sense of rectitude or self-esteem; and who,\r\nwhen ambition was awakened in him, gave himself up to its influence\r\nunbridled by any scruple. His father had been a methodist preacher, an\r\nenthusiastic man with simple intentions; but whose pernicious doctrines\r\nof election and special grace had contributed to destroy all\r\nconscientious feeling in his son. During the progress of the pestilence\r\nhe had entered upon various schemes, by which to acquire adherents and\r\npower. Adrian had discovered and defeated these attempts; but Adrian\r\nwas absent; the wolf assumed the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s garb, and the flock\r\nadmitted the deception: he had formed a party during the few weeks he\r\nhad been in Paris, who zealously propagated the creed of his divine\r\nmission, and believed that safety and salvation were to be afforded\r\nonly to those who put their trust in him.\r\n\r\nWhen once the spirit of dissension had arisen, the most frivolous\r\ncauses gave it activity. The first party, on arriving at Paris, had\r\ntaken possession of the Tuileries; chance and friendly feeling had\r\ninduced the second to lodge near to them. A contest arose concerning\r\nthe distribution of the pillage; the chiefs of the first division\r\ndemanded that the whole should be placed at their disposal; with this\r\nassumption the opposite party refused to comply. When next the latter\r\nwent to forage, the gates of Paris were shut on them. After overcoming\r\nthis difficulty, they marched in a body to the Tuileries. They found\r\nthat their enemies had been already expelled thence by the Elect, as\r\nthe fanatical party designated themselves, who refused to admit any\r\ninto the palace who did not first abjure obedience to all except God,\r\nand his delegate on earth, their chief. Such was the beginning of the\r\nstrife, which at length proceeded so far, that the three divisions,\r\narmed, met in the Place Vendome, each resolved to subdue by force the\r\nresistance of its adversaries. They assembled, their muskets were\r\nloaded, and even pointed at the breasts of their so called enemies. One\r\nword had been sufficient; and there the last of mankind would have\r\nburthened their souls with the crime of murder, and dipt their hands in\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s blood. A sense of shame, a recollection that not only\r\ntheir cause, but the existence of the whole human race was at stake,\r\nentered the breast of the leader of the more numerous party. He was\r\naware, that if the ranks were thinned, no other recruits could fill\r\nthem up; that each man was as a priceless gem in a kingly crown, which\r\nif destroyed, the earth\xe2\x80\x99s deep entrails could yield no paragon. He was\r\na young man, and had been hurried on by presumption, and the notion of\r\nhis high rank and superiority to all other pretenders; now he repented\r\nhis work, he felt that all the blood about to be shed would be on his\r\nhead; with sudden impulse therefore he spurred his horse between the\r\nbands, and, having fixed a white handkerchief on the point of his\r\nuplifted sword, thus demanded parley; the opposite leaders obeyed the\r\nsignal. He spoke with warmth; he reminded them of the oath all the\r\nchiefs had taken to submit to the Lord Protector; he declared their\r\npresent meeting to be an act of treason and mutiny; he allowed that he\r\nhad been hurried away by passion, but that a cooler moment had arrived;\r\nand he proposed that each party should send deputies to the Earl of\r\nWindsor, inviting his interference and offering submission to his\r\ndecision. His offer was accepted so far, that each leader consented to\r\ncommand a retreat, and moreover agreed, that after the approbation of\r\ntheir several parties had been consulted, they should meet that night\r\non some neutral spot to ratify the truce. At the meeting of the chiefs,\r\nthis plan was finally concluded upon. The leader of the fanatics indeed\r\nrefused to admit the arbitration of Adrian; he sent ambassadors, rather\r\nthan deputies, to assert his claim, not plead his cause.\r\n\r\nThe truce was to continue until the first of February, when the bands\r\nwere again to assemble on the Place Vendome; it was of the utmost\r\nconsequence therefore that Adrian should arrive in Paris by that day,\r\nsince an hair might turn the scale, and peace, scared away by intestine\r\nbroils, might only return to watch by the silent dead. It was now the\r\ntwenty-eighth of January; every vessel stationed near Dover had been\r\nbeaten to pieces and destroyed by the furious storms I have\r\ncommemorated. Our journey however would admit of no delay. That very\r\nnight, Adrian, and I, and twelve others, either friends or attendants,\r\nput off from the English shore, in the boat that had brought over the\r\ndeputies. We all took our turn at the oar; and the immediate occasion\r\nof our departure affording us abundant matter for conjecture and\r\ndiscourse, prevented the feeling that we left our native country,\r\ndepopulate England, for the last time, to enter deeply into the minds\r\nof the greater part of our number. It was a serene starlight night, and\r\nthe dark line of the English coast continued for some time visible at\r\nintervals, as we rose on the broad back of the waves. I exerted myself\r\nwith my long oar to give swift impulse to our skiff; and, while the\r\nwaters splashed with melancholy sound against its sides, I looked with\r\nsad affection on this last glimpse of sea-girt England, and strained my\r\neyes not too soon to lose sight of the castellated cliff, which rose to\r\nprotect the land of heroism and beauty from the inroads of ocean, that,\r\nturbulent as I had lately seen it, required such cyclopean walls for\r\nits repulsion. A solitary sea-gull winged its flight over our heads, to\r\nseek its nest in a cleft of the precipice. Yes, thou shalt revisit the\r\nland of thy birth, I thought, as I looked invidiously on the airy\r\nvoyager; but we shall, never more! Tomb of Idris, farewell! Grave, in\r\nwhich my heart lies sepultured, farewell for ever!\r\n\r\nWe were twelve hours at sea, and the heavy swell obliged us to exert\r\nall our strength. At length, by mere dint of rowing, we reached the\r\nFrench coast. The stars faded, and the grey morning cast a dim veil\r\nover the silver horns of the waning moon\xe2\x80\x94the sun rose broad and red\r\nfrom the sea, as we walked over the sands to Calais. Our first care was\r\nto procure horses, and although wearied by our night of watching and\r\ntoil, some of our party immediately went in quest of these in the wide\r\nfields of the unenclosed and now barren plain round Calais. We divided\r\nourselves, like seamen, into watches, and some reposed, while others\r\nprepared the morning\xe2\x80\x99s repast. Our foragers returned at noon with only\r\nsix horses\xe2\x80\x94on these, Adrian and I, and four others, proceeded on our\r\njourney towards the great city, which its inhabitants had fondly named\r\nthe capital of the civilized world. Our horses had become, through\r\ntheir long holiday, almost wild, and we crossed the plain round Calais\r\nwith impetuous speed. From the height near Boulogne, I turned again to\r\nlook on England; nature had cast a misty pall over her, her cliff was\r\nhidden\xe2\x80\x94there was spread the watery barrier that divided us, never again\r\nto be crossed; she lay on the ocean plain,\r\n\r\nIn the great pool a swan\xe2\x80\x99s nest.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuined the nest, alas! the swans of Albion had passed away for ever\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nuninhabited rock in the wide Pacific, which had remained since the\r\ncreation uninhabited, unnamed, unmarked, would be of as much account in\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s future history, as desert England.\r\n\r\nOur journey was impeded by a thousand obstacles. As our horses grew\r\ntired, we had to seek for others; and hours were wasted, while we\r\nexhausted our artifices to allure some of these enfranchised slaves of\r\nman to resume the yoke; or as we went from stable to stable through the\r\ntowns, hoping to find some who had not forgotten the shelter of their\r\nnative stalls. Our ill success in procuring them, obliged us\r\ncontinually to leave some one of our companions behind; and on the\r\nfirst of February, Adrian and I entered Paris, wholly unaccompanied.\r\nThe serene morning had dawned when we arrived at Saint Denis, and the\r\nsun was high, when the clamour of voices, and the clash, as we feared,\r\nof weapons, guided us to where our countrymen had assembled on the\r\nPlace Vendome. We passed a knot of Frenchmen, who were talking\r\nearnestly of the madness of the insular invaders, and then coming by a\r\nsudden turn upon the Place, we saw the sun glitter on drawn swords and\r\nfixed bayonets, while yells and clamours rent the air. It was a scene\r\nof unaccustomed confusion in these days of depopulation. Roused by\r\nfancied wrongs, and insulting scoffs, the opposite parties had rushed\r\nto attack each other; while the elect, drawn up apart, seemed to wait\r\nan opportunity to fall with better advantage on their foes, when they\r\nshould have mutually weakened each other. A merciful power interposed,\r\nand no blood was shed; for, while the insane mob were in the very act\r\nof attack, the females, wives, mothers and daughters, rushed between;\r\nthey seized the bridles; they embraced the knees of the horsemen, and\r\nhung on the necks, or enweaponed arms of their enraged relatives; the\r\nshrill female scream was mingled with the manly shout, and formed the\r\nwild clamour that welcomed us on our arrival.\r\n\r\nOur voices could not be heard in the tumult; Adrian however was eminent\r\nfor the white charger he rode; spurring him, he dashed into the midst\r\nof the throng: he was recognized, and a loud cry raised for England and\r\nthe Protector. The late adversaries, warmed to affection at the sight\r\nof him, joined in heedless confusion, and surrounded him; the women\r\nkissed his hands, and the edges of his garments; nay, his horse\r\nreceived tribute of their embraces; some wept their welcome; he\r\nappeared an angel of peace descended among them; and the only danger\r\nwas, that his mortal nature would be demonstrated, by his suffocation\r\nfrom the kindness of his friends. His voice was at length heard, and\r\nobeyed; the crowd fell back; the chiefs alone rallied round him. I had\r\nseen Lord Raymond ride through his lines; his look of victory, and\r\nmajestic mien obtained the respect and obedience of all: such was not\r\nthe appearance or influence of Adrian. His slight figure, his fervent\r\nlook, his gesture, more of deprecation than rule, were proofs that\r\nlove, unmingled with fear, gave him dominion over the hearts of a\r\nmultitude, who knew that he never flinched from danger, nor was\r\nactuated by other motives than care for the general welfare. No\r\ndistinction was now visible between the two parties, late ready to shed\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s blood, for, though neither would submit to the other, they\r\nboth yielded ready obedience to the Earl of Windsor.\r\n\r\nOne party however remained, cut off from the rest, which did not\r\nsympathize in the joy exhibited on Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, or imbibe the\r\nspirit of peace, which fell like dew upon the softened hearts of their\r\ncountrymen. At the head of this assembly was a ponderous, dark-looking\r\nman, whose malign eye surveyed with gloating delight the stern looks of\r\nhis followers. They had hitherto been inactive, but now, perceiving\r\nthemselves to be forgotten in the universal jubilee, they advanced with\r\nthreatening gestures: our friends had, as it were in wanton contention,\r\nattacked each other; they wanted but to be told that their cause was\r\none, for it to become so: their mutual anger had been a fire of straw,\r\ncompared to the slow-burning hatred they both entertained for these\r\nseceders, who seized a portion of the world to come, there to entrench\r\nand incastellate themselves, and to issue with fearful sally, and\r\nappalling denunciations, on the mere common children of the earth. The\r\nfirst advance of the little army of the elect reawakened their rage;\r\nthey grasped their arms, and waited but their leader\xe2\x80\x99s signal to\r\ncommence the attack, when the clear tones of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s voice were heard,\r\ncommanding them to fall back; with confused murmur and hurried retreat,\r\nas the wave ebbs clamorously from the sands it lately covered, our\r\nfriends obeyed. Adrian rode singly into the space between the opposing\r\nbands; he approached the hostile leader, as requesting him to imitate\r\nhis example, but his look was not obeyed, and the chief advanced,\r\nfollowed by his whole troop. There were many women among them, who\r\nseemed more eager and resolute than their male companions. They pressed\r\nround their leader, as if to shield him, while they loudly bestowed on\r\nhim every sacred denomination and epithet of worship. Adrian met them\r\nhalf way; they halted: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you seek? Do you require\r\nany thing of us that we refuse to give, and that you are forced to\r\nacquire by arms and warfare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis questions were answered by a general cry, in which the words\r\nelection, sin, and red right arm of God, could alone be heard.\r\n\r\nAdrian looked expressly at their leader, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you not silence\r\nyour followers? Mine, you perceive, obey me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fellow answered by a scowl; and then, perhaps fearful that his\r\npeople should become auditors of the debate he expected to ensue, he\r\ncommanded them to fall back, and advanced by himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, I again\r\nask,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you require of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepentance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, whose sinister brow gathered clouds as\r\nhe spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cObedience to the will of the Most High, made manifest to\r\nthese his Elected People. Do we not all die through your sins, O\r\ngeneration of unbelief, and have we not a right to demand of you\r\nrepentance and obedience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if we refuse them, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d his opponent inquired mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the man, \xe2\x80\x9cGod hears you, and will smite your stony\r\nheart in his wrath; his poisoned arrows fly, his dogs of death are\r\nunleashed! We will not perish unrevenged\xe2\x80\x94and mighty will our avenger\r\nbe, when he descends in visible majesty, and scatters destruction among\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, with quiet scorn, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish that you were\r\nignorant only, and I think it would be no difficult task to prove to\r\nyou, that you speak of what you do not understand. On the present\r\noccasion however, it is enough for me to know that you seek nothing of\r\nus; and, heaven is our witness, we seek nothing of you. I should be\r\nsorry to embitter by strife the few days that we any of us may have\r\nhere to live; when there,\xe2\x80\x9d he pointed downwards, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall not be able\r\nto contend, while here we need not. Go home, or stay; pray to your God\r\nin your own mode; your friends may do the like. My orisons consist in\r\npeace and good will, in resignation and hope. Farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed slightly to the angry disputant who was about to reply; and,\r\nturning his horse down Rue Saint Honore, called on his friends to\r\nfollow him. He rode slowly, to give time to all to join him at the\r\nBarrier, and then issued his orders that those who yielded obedience to\r\nhim, should rendezvous at Versailles. In the meantime he remained\r\nwithin the walls of Paris, until he had secured the safe retreat of\r\nall. In about a fortnight the remainder of the emigrants arrived from\r\nEngland, and they all repaired to Versailles; apartments were prepared\r\nfor the family of the Protector in the Grand Trianon, and there, after\r\nthe excitement of these events, we reposed amidst the luxuries of the\r\ndeparted Bourbons.\r\n\r\n [21] Chorus in \xc5\x92dipus Coloneus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the repose of a few days, we held a council, to decide on our\r\nfuture movements. Our first plan had been to quit our wintry native\r\nlatitude, and seek for our diminished numbers the luxuries and delights\r\nof a southern climate. We had not fixed on any precise spot as the\r\ntermination of our wanderings; but a vague picture of perpetual spring,\r\nfragrant groves, and sparkling streams, floated in our imagination to\r\nentice us on. A variety of causes had detained us in England, and we\r\nhad now arrived at the middle of February; if we pursued our original\r\nproject, we should find ourselves in a worse situation than before,\r\nhaving exchanged our temperate climate for the intolerable heats of a\r\nsummer in Egypt or Persia. We were therefore obliged to modify our\r\nplan, as the season continued to be inclement; and it was determined\r\nthat we should await the arrival of spring in our present abode, and so\r\norder our future movements as to pass the hot months in the icy vallies\r\nof Switzerland, deferring our southern progress until the ensuing\r\nautumn, if such a season was ever again to be beheld by us.\r\n\r\nThe castle and town of Versailles afforded our numbers ample\r\naccommodation, and foraging parties took it by turns to supply our\r\nwants. There was a strange and appalling motley in the situation of\r\nthese the last of the race. At first I likened it to a colony, which\r\nborne over the far seas, struck root for the first time in a new\r\ncountry. But where was the bustle and industry characteristic of such\r\nan assemblage; the rudely constructed dwelling, which was to suffice\r\ntill a more commodious mansion could be built; the marking out of\r\nfields; the attempt at cultivation; the eager curiosity to discover\r\nunknown animals and herbs; the excursions for the sake of exploring the\r\ncountry? Our habitations were palaces\xe2\x80\x94our food was ready stored in\r\ngranaries\xe2\x80\x94there was no need of labour, no inquisitiveness, no restless\r\ndesire to get on. If we had been assured that we should secure the\r\nlives of our present numbers, there would have been more vivacity and\r\nhope in our councils. We should have discussed as to the period when\r\nthe existing produce for man\xe2\x80\x99s sustenance would no longer suffice for\r\nus, and what mode of life we should then adopt. We should have\r\nconsidered more carefully our future plans, and debated concerning the\r\nspot where we should in future dwell. But summer and the plague were\r\nnear, and we dared not look forward. Every heart sickened at the\r\nthought of amusement; if the younger part of our community were ever\r\nimpelled, by youthful and untamed hilarity, to enter on any dance or\r\nsong, to cheer the melancholy time, they would suddenly break off,\r\nchecked by a mournful look or agonizing sigh from any one among them,\r\nwho was prevented by sorrows and losses from mingling in the festivity.\r\nIf laughter echoed under our roof, yet the heart was vacant of joy;\r\nand, when ever it chanced that I witnessed such attempts at pastime,\r\nthey encreased instead of diminishing my sense of woe. In the midst of\r\nthe pleasure-hunting throng, I would close my eyes, and see before me\r\nthe obscure cavern, where was garnered the mortality of Idris, and the\r\ndead lay around, mouldering in hushed repose. When I again became aware\r\nof the present hour, softest melody of Lydian flute, or harmonious maze\r\nof graceful dance, was but as the demoniac chorus in the Wolf\xe2\x80\x99s Glen,\r\nand the caperings of the reptiles that surrounded the magic circle.\r\n\r\nMy dearest interval of peace occurred, when, released from the\r\nobligation of associating with the crowd, I could repose in the dear\r\nhome where my children lived. Children I say, for the tenderest\r\nemotions of paternity bound me to Clara. She was now fourteen; sorrow,\r\nand deep insight into the scenes around her, calmed the restless spirit\r\nof girlhood; while the remembrance of her father whom she idolized, and\r\nrespect for me and Adrian, implanted an high sense of duty in her young\r\nheart. Though serious she was not sad; the eager desire that makes us\r\nall, when young, plume our wings, and stretch our necks, that we may\r\nmore swiftly alight tiptoe on the height of maturity, was subdued in\r\nher by early experience. All that she could spare of overflowing love\r\nfrom her parents\xe2\x80\x99 memory, and attention to her living relatives, was\r\nspent upon religion. This was the hidden law of her heart, which she\r\nconcealed with childish reserve, and cherished the more because it was\r\nsecret. What faith so entire, what charity so pure, what hope so\r\nfervent, as that of early youth? and she, all love, all tenderness and\r\ntrust, who from infancy had been tossed on the wide sea of passion and\r\nmisfortune, saw the finger of apparent divinity in all, and her best\r\nhope was to make herself acceptable to the power she worshipped. Evelyn\r\nwas only five years old; his joyous heart was incapable of sorrow, and\r\nhe enlivened our house with the innocent mirth incident to his years.\r\n\r\nThe aged Countess of Windsor had fallen from her dream of power, rank\r\nand grandeur; she had been suddenly seized with the conviction, that\r\nlove was the only good of life, virtue the only ennobling distinction\r\nand enriching wealth. Such a lesson had been taught her by the dead\r\nlips of her neglected daughter; and she devoted herself, with all the\r\nfiery violence of her character, to the obtaining the affection of the\r\nremnants of her family. In early years the heart of Adrian had been\r\nchilled towards her; and, though he observed a due respect, her\r\ncoldness, mixed with the recollection of disappointment and madness,\r\ncaused him to feel even pain in her society. She saw this, and yet\r\ndetermined to win his love; the obstacle served the rather to excite\r\nher ambition. As Henry, Emperor of Germany, lay in the snow before Pope\r\nLeo\xe2\x80\x99s gate for three winter days and nights, so did she in humility\r\nwait before the icy barriers of his closed heart, till he, the servant\r\nof love, and prince of tender courtesy, opened it wide for her\r\nadmittance, bestowing, with fervency and gratitude, the tribute of\r\nfilial affection she merited. Her understanding, courage, and presence\r\nof mind, became powerful auxiliaries to him in the difficult task of\r\nruling the tumultuous crowd, which were subjected to his control, in\r\ntruth by a single hair.\r\n\r\nThe principal circumstances that disturbed our tranquillity during this\r\ninterval, originated in the vicinity of the impostor-prophet and his\r\nfollowers. They continued to reside at Paris; but missionaries from\r\namong them often visited Versailles\xe2\x80\x94and such was the power of\r\nassertions, however false, yet vehemently iterated, over the ready\r\ncredulity of the ignorant and fearful, that they seldom failed in\r\ndrawing over to their party some from among our numbers. An instance of\r\nthis nature coming immediately under our notice, we were led to\r\nconsider the miserable state in which we should leave our countrymen,\r\nwhen we should, at the approach of summer, move on towards Switzerland,\r\nand leave a deluded crew behind us in the hands of their miscreant\r\nleader. The sense of the smallness of our numbers, and expectation of\r\ndecrease, pressed upon us; and, while it would be a subject of\r\ncongratulation to ourselves to add one to our party, it would be doubly\r\ngratifying to rescue from the pernicious influence of superstition and\r\nunrelenting tyranny, the victims that now, though voluntarily\r\nenchained, groaned beneath it. If we had considered the preacher as\r\nsincere in a belief of his own denunciations, or only moderately\r\nactuated by kind feeling in the exercise of his assumed powers, we\r\nshould have immediately addressed ourselves to him, and endeavoured\r\nwith our best arguments to soften and humanize his views. But he was\r\ninstigated by ambition, he desired to rule over these last stragglers\r\nfrom the fold of death; his projects went so far, as to cause him to\r\ncalculate that, if, from these crushed remains, a few survived, so that\r\na new race should spring up, he, by holding tight the reins of belief,\r\nmight be remembered by the post-pestilential race as a patriarch, a\r\nprophet, nay a deity; such as of old among the post-diluvians were\r\nJupiter the conqueror, Serapis the lawgiver, and Vishnou the preserver.\r\nThese ideas made him inflexible in his rule, and violent in his hate of\r\nany who presumed to share with him his usurped empire.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact, but incontestible, that the philanthropist, who\r\nardent in his desire to do good, who patient, reasonable and gentle,\r\nyet disdains to use other argument than truth, has less influence over\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s minds, than he who, grasping and selfish, refuses not to adopt\r\nany means, nor awaken any passion, nor diffuse any falsehood, for the\r\nadvancement of his cause. If this from time immemorial has been the\r\ncase, the contrast was infinitely greater, now that the one could bring\r\nharrowing fears and transcendent hopes into play; while the other had\r\nfew hopes to hold forth, nor could influence the imagination to\r\ndiminish the fears which he himself was the first to entertain. The\r\npreacher had persuaded his followers, that their escape from the\r\nplague, the salvation of their children, and the rise of a new race of\r\nmen from their seed, depended on their faith in, and their submission\r\nto him. They greedily imbibed this belief; and their over-weening\r\ncredulity even rendered them eager to make converts to the same faith.\r\n\r\nHow to seduce any individuals from such an alliance of fraud, was a\r\nfrequent subject of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s meditations and discourse. He formed many\r\nplans for the purpose; but his own troop kept him in full occupation to\r\nensure their fidelity and safety; beside which the preacher was as\r\ncautious and prudent, as he was cruel. His victims lived under the\r\nstrictest rules and laws, which either entirely imprisoned them within\r\nthe Tuileries, or let them out in such numbers, and under such leaders,\r\nas precluded the possibility of controversy. There was one among them\r\nhowever whom I resolved to save; she had been known to us in happier\r\ndays; Idris had loved her; and her excellent nature made it peculiarly\r\nlamentable that she should be sacrificed by this merciless cannibal of\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nThis man had between two and three hundred persons enlisted under his\r\nbanners. More than half of them were women; there were about fifty\r\nchildren of all ages; and not more than eighty men. They were mostly\r\ndrawn from that which, when such distinctions existed, was denominated\r\nthe lower rank of society. The exceptions consisted of a few high-born\r\nfemales, who, panic-struck, and tamed by sorrow, had joined him. Among\r\nthese was one, young, lovely, and enthusiastic, whose very goodness\r\nmade her a more easy victim. I have mentioned her before: Juliet, the\r\nyoungest daughter, and now sole relic of the ducal house of L\xe2\x80\x94-. There\r\nare some beings, whom fate seems to select on whom to pour, in\r\nunmeasured portion, the vials of her wrath, and whom she bathes even to\r\nthe lips in misery. Such a one was the ill-starred Juliet. She had lost\r\nher indulgent parents, her brothers and sisters, companions of her\r\nyouth; in one fell swoop they had been carried off from her. Yet she\r\nhad again dared to call herself happy; united to her admirer, to him\r\nwho possessed and filled her whole heart, she yielded to the lethean\r\npowers of love, and knew and felt only his life and presence. At the\r\nvery time when with keen delight she welcomed the tokens of maternity,\r\nthis sole prop of her life failed, her husband died of the plague. For\r\na time she had been lulled in insanity; the birth of her child restored\r\nher to the cruel reality of things, but gave her at the same time an\r\nobject for whom to preserve at once life and reason. Every friend and\r\nrelative had died off, and she was reduced to solitude and penury; deep\r\nmelancholy and angry impatience distorted her judgment, so that she\r\ncould not persuade herself to disclose her distress to us. When she\r\nheard of the plan of universal emigration, she resolved to remain\r\nbehind with her child, and alone in wide England to live or die, as\r\nfate might decree, beside the grave of her beloved. She had hidden\r\nherself in one of the many empty habitations of London; it was she who\r\nrescued my Idris on the fatal twentieth of November, though my\r\nimmediate danger, and the subsequent illness of Idris, caused us to\r\nforget our hapless friend. This circumstance had however brought her\r\nagain in contact with her fellow-creatures; a slight illness of her\r\ninfant, proved to her that she was still bound to humanity by an\r\nindestructible tie; to preserve this little creature\xe2\x80\x99s life became the\r\nobject of her being, and she joined the first division of migrants who\r\nwent over to Paris.\r\n\r\nShe became an easy prey to the methodist; her sensibility and acute\r\nfears rendered her accessible to every impulse; her love for her child\r\nmade her eager to cling to the merest straw held out to save him. Her\r\nmind, once unstrung, and now tuned by roughest inharmonious hands, made\r\nher credulous: beautiful as fabled goddess, with voice of unrivalled\r\nsweetness, burning with new lighted enthusiasm, she became a stedfast\r\nproselyte, and powerful auxiliary to the leader of the elect. I had\r\nremarked her in the crowd, on the day we met on the Place Vendome; and,\r\nrecollecting suddenly her providential rescue of my lost one, on the\r\nnight of the twentieth of November, I reproached myself for my neglect\r\nand ingratitude, and felt impelled to leave no means that I could adopt\r\nuntried, to recall her to her better self, and rescue her from the\r\nfangs of the hypocrite destroyer.\r\n\r\nI will not, at this period of my story, record the artifices I used to\r\npenetrate the asylum of the Tuileries, or give what would be a tedious\r\naccount of my stratagems, disappointments, and perseverance. I at last\r\nsucceeded in entering these walls, and roamed its halls and corridors\r\nin eager hope to find my selected convert. In the evening I contrived\r\nto mingle unobserved with the congregation, which assembled in the\r\nchapel to listen to the crafty and eloquent harangue of their prophet.\r\nI saw Juliet near him. Her dark eyes, fearfully impressed with the\r\nrestless glare of madness, were fixed on him; she held her infant, not\r\nyet a year old, in her arms; and care of it alone could distract her\r\nattention from the words to which she eagerly listened. After the\r\nsermon was over, the congregation dispersed; all quitted the chapel\r\nexcept she whom I sought; her babe had fallen asleep; so she placed it\r\non a cushion, and sat on the floor beside, watching its tranquil\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nI presented myself to her; for a moment natural feeling produced a\r\nsentiment of gladness, which disappeared again, when with ardent and\r\naffectionate exhortation I besought her to accompany me in flight from\r\nthis den of superstition and misery. In a moment she relapsed into the\r\ndelirium of fanaticism, and, but that her gentle nature forbade, would\r\nhave loaded me with execrations. She conjured me, she commanded me to\r\nleave her\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cBeware, O beware,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cfly while yet your escape is\r\npracticable. Now you are safe; but strange sounds and inspirations come\r\non me at times, and if the Eternal should in awful whisper reveal to me\r\nhis will, that to save my child you must be sacrificed, I would call in\r\nthe satellites of him you call the tyrant; they would tear you limb\r\nfrom limb; nor would I hallow the death of him whom Idris loved, by a\r\nsingle tear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke hurriedly, with tuneless voice, and wild look; her child\r\nawoke, and, frightened, began to cry; each sob went to the ill-fated\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and she mingled the epithets of endearment she\r\naddressed to her infant, with angry commands that I should leave her.\r\nHad I had the means, I would have risked all, have torn her by force\r\nfrom the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s den, and trusted to the healing balm of reason and\r\naffection. But I had no choice, no power even of longer struggle; steps\r\nwere heard along the gallery, and the voice of the preacher drew near.\r\nJuliet, straining her child in a close embrace, fled by another\r\npassage. Even then I would have followed her; but my foe and his\r\nsatellites entered; I was surrounded, and taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nI remembered the menace of the unhappy Juliet, and expected the full\r\ntempest of the man\xe2\x80\x99s vengeance, and the awakened wrath of his\r\nfollowers, to fall instantly upon me. I was questioned. My answers were\r\nsimple and sincere. \xe2\x80\x9cHis own mouth condemns him,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nimpostor; \xe2\x80\x9che confesses that his intention was to seduce from the way\r\nof salvation our well-beloved sister in God; away with him to the\r\ndungeon; to-morrow he dies the death; we are manifestly called upon to\r\nmake an example, tremendous and appalling, to scare the children of sin\r\nfrom our asylum of the saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy heart revolted from his hypocritical jargon: but it was unworthy of\r\nme to combat in words with the ruffian; and my answer was cool; while,\r\nfar from being possessed with fear, methought, even at the worst, a man\r\ntrue to himself, courageous and determined, could fight his way, even\r\nfrom the boards of the scaffold, through the herd of these misguided\r\nmaniacs. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho I am; and be well assured that I\r\nshall not die unavenged. Your legal magistrate, the Lord Protector,\r\nknew of my design, and is aware that I am here; the cry of blood will\r\nreach him, and you and your miserable victims will long lament the\r\ntragedy you are about to act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy antagonist did not deign to reply, even by a look;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou know your\r\nduty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his comrades,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cobey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment I was thrown on the earth, bound, blindfolded, and hurried\r\naway \xe2\x80\x94liberty of limb and sight was only restored to me, when,\r\nsurrounded by dungeon-walls, dark and impervious, I found myself a\r\nprisoner and alone.\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of my attempt to gain over the proselyte of this\r\nman of crime; I could not conceive that he would dare put me to\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x94Yet I was in his hands; the path of his ambition had ever been\r\ndark and cruel; his power was founded upon fear; the one word which\r\nmight cause me to die, unheard, unseen, in the obscurity of my dungeon,\r\nmight be easier to speak than the deed of mercy to act. He would not\r\nrisk probably a public execution; but a private assassination would at\r\nonce terrify any of my companions from attempting a like feat, at the\r\nsame time that a cautious line of conduct might enable him to avoid the\r\nenquiries and the vengeance of Adrian.\r\n\r\nTwo months ago, in a vault more obscure than the one I now inhabited, I\r\nhad revolved the design of quietly laying me down to die; now I\r\nshuddered at the approach of fate. My imagination was busied in shaping\r\nforth the kind of death he would inflict. Would he allow me to wear out\r\nlife with famine; or was the food administered to me to be medicined\r\nwith death? Would he steal on me in my sleep; or should I contend to\r\nthe last with my murderers, knowing, even while I struggled, that I\r\nmust be overcome? I lived upon an earth whose diminished population a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s arithmetic might number; I had lived through long months with\r\ndeath stalking close at my side, while at intervals the shadow of his\r\nskeleton-shape darkened my path. I had believed that I despised the\r\ngrim phantom, and laughed his power to scorn.\r\n\r\nAny other fate I should have met with courage, nay, have gone out\r\ngallantly to encounter. But to be murdered thus at the midnight hour by\r\ncold-blooded assassins, no friendly hand to close my eyes, or receive\r\nmy parting blessing\xe2\x80\x94to die in combat, hate and execration\xe2\x80\x94ah, why, my\r\nangel love, didst thou restore me to life, when already I had stepped\r\nwithin the portals of the tomb, now that so soon again I was to be\r\nflung back a mangled corpse!\r\n\r\nHours passed\xe2\x80\x94centuries. Could I give words to the many thoughts which\r\noccupied me in endless succession during this interval, I should fill\r\nvolumes. The air was dank, the dungeon-floor mildewed and icy cold;\r\nhunger came upon me too, and no sound reached me from without.\r\nTo-morrow the ruffian had declared that I should die. When would\r\nto-morrow come? Was it not already here?\r\n\r\nMy door was about to be opened. I heard the key turn, and the bars and\r\nbolts slowly removed. The opening of intervening passages permitted\r\nsounds from the interior of the palace to reach me; and I heard the\r\nclock strike one. They come to murder me, I thought; this hour does not\r\nbefit a public execution. I drew myself up against the wall opposite\r\nthe entrance; I collected my forces, I rallied my courage, I would not\r\nfall a tame prey. Slowly the door receded on its hinges\xe2\x80\x94I was ready to\r\nspring forward to seize and grapple with the intruder, till the sight\r\nof who it was changed at once the temper of my mind. It was Juliet\r\nherself; pale and trembling she stood, a lamp in her hand, on the\r\nthreshold of the dungeon, looking at me with wistful countenance. But\r\nin a moment she re-assumed her self-possession; and her languid eyes\r\nrecovered their brilliancy. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am come to save you, Verney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yourself also,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried: \xe2\x80\x9cdearest friend, can we indeed be saved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cfollow me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed instantly. We threaded with light steps many corridors,\r\nascended several flights of stairs, and passed through long galleries;\r\nat the end of one she unlocked a low portal; a rush of wind\r\nextinguished our lamp; but, in lieu of it, we had the blessed\r\nmoon-beams and the open face of heaven. Then first Juliet spoke:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare safe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x94 farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI seized her reluctant hand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cmisguided victim,\r\ndo you not intend to escape with me? Have you not risked all in\r\nfacilitating my flight? and do you think, that I will permit you to\r\nreturn, and suffer alone the effects of that miscreant\xe2\x80\x99s rage? Never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not fear for me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lovely girl mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand do not\r\nimagine that without the consent of our chief you could be without\r\nthese walls. It is he that has saved you; he assigned to me the part of\r\nleading you hither, because I am best acquainted with your motives for\r\ncoming here, and can best appreciate his mercy in permitting you to\r\ndepart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe dupe of this man? He dreads me alive as an\r\nenemy, and dead he fears my avengers. By favouring this clandestine\r\nescape he preserves a shew of consistency to his followers; but mercy\r\nis far from his heart. Do you forget his artifices, his cruelty, and\r\nfraud? As I am free, so are you. Come, Juliet, the mother of our lost\r\nIdris will welcome you, the noble Adrian will rejoice to receive you;\r\nyou will find peace and love, and better hopes than fanaticism can\r\nafford. Come, and fear not; long before day we shall be at Versailles;\r\nclose the door on this abode of crime \xe2\x80\x94come, sweet Juliet, from\r\nhypocrisy and guilt to the society of the affectionate and good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI spoke hurriedly, but with fervour: and while with gentle violence I\r\ndrew her from the portal, some thought, some recollection of past\r\nscenes of youth and happiness, made her listen and yield to me;\r\nsuddenly she broke away with a piercing shriek:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy child, my child! he\r\nhas my child; my darling girl is my hostage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe darted from me into the passage; the gate closed between us\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nleft in the fangs of this man of crime, a prisoner, still to inhale the\r\npestilential atmosphere which adhered to his demoniac nature; the\r\nunimpeded breeze played on my cheek, the moon shone graciously upon me,\r\nmy path was free. Glad to have escaped, yet melancholy in my very joy,\r\nI retrod my steps to Versailles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventful winter passed; winter, the respite of our ills. By degrees the\r\nsun, which with slant beams had before yielded the more extended reign\r\nto night, lengthened his diurnal journey, and mounted his highest\r\nthrone, at once the fosterer of earth\xe2\x80\x99s new beauty, and her lover. We\r\nwho, like flies that congregate upon a dry rock at the ebbing of the\r\ntide, had played wantonly with time, allowing our passions, our hopes,\r\nand our mad desires to rule us, now heard the approaching roar of the\r\nocean of destruction, and would have fled to some sheltered crevice,\r\nbefore the first wave broke over us. We resolved without delay, to\r\ncommence our journey to Switzerland; we became eager to leave France.\r\nUnder the icy vaults of the glaciers, beneath the shadow of the pines,\r\nthe swinging of whose mighty branches was arrested by a load of snow;\r\nbeside the streams whose intense cold proclaimed their origin to be\r\nfrom the slow-melting piles of congelated waters, amidst frequent\r\nstorms which might purify the air, we should find health, if in truth\r\nhealth were not herself diseased.\r\n\r\nWe began our preparations at first with alacrity. We did not now bid\r\nadieu to our native country, to the graves of those we loved, to the\r\nflowers, and streams, and trees, which had lived beside us from\r\ninfancy. Small sorrow would be ours on leaving Paris. A scene of shame,\r\nwhen we remembered our late contentions, and thought that we left\r\nbehind a flock of miserable, deluded victims, bending under the tyranny\r\nof a selfish impostor. Small pangs should we feel in leaving the\r\ngardens, woods, and halls of the palaces of the Bourbons at Versailles,\r\nwhich we feared would soon be tainted by the dead, when we looked\r\nforward to vallies lovelier than any garden, to mighty forests and\r\nhalls, built not for mortal majesty, but palaces of nature\xe2\x80\x99s own, with\r\nthe Alp of marmoreal whiteness for their walls, the sky for their roof.\r\n\r\nYet our spirits flagged, as the day drew near which we had fixed for\r\nour departure. Dire visions and evil auguries, if such things were,\r\nthickened around us, so that in vain might men say\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThese are their reasons, they are natural,[22]\r\n\r\n\r\nwe felt them to be ominous, and dreaded the future event enchained to\r\nthem. That the night owl should screech before the noon-day sun, that\r\nthe hard-winged bat should wheel around the bed of beauty, that\r\nmuttering thunder should in early spring startle the cloudless air,\r\nthat sudden and exterminating blight should fall on the tree and shrub,\r\nwere unaccustomed, but physical events, less horrible than the mental\r\ncreations of almighty fear. Some had sight of funeral processions, and\r\nfaces all begrimed with tears, which flitted through the long avenues\r\nof the gardens, and drew aside the curtains of the sleepers at dead of\r\nnight. Some heard wailing and cries in the air; a mournful chaunt would\r\nstream through the dark atmosphere, as if spirits above sang the\r\nrequiem of the human race. What was there in all this, but that fear\r\ncreated other senses within our frames, making us see, hear, and feel\r\nwhat was not? What was this, but the action of diseased imaginations\r\nand childish credulity? So might it be; but what was most real, was the\r\nexistence of these very fears; the staring looks of horror, the faces\r\npale even to ghastliness, the voices struck dumb with harrowing dread,\r\nof those among us who saw and heard these things. Of this number was\r\nAdrian, who knew the delusion, yet could not cast off the clinging\r\nterror. Even ignorant infancy appeared with timorous shrieks and\r\nconvulsions to acknowledge the presence of unseen powers. We must go:\r\nin change of scene, in occupation, and such security as we still hoped\r\nto find, we should discover a cure for these gathering horrors.\r\n\r\nOn mustering our company, we found them to consist of fourteen hundred\r\nsouls, men, women, and children. Until now therefore, we were\r\nundiminished in numbers, except by the desertion of those who had\r\nattached themselves to the impostor-prophet, and remained behind in\r\nParis. About fifty French joined us. Our order of march was easily\r\narranged; the ill success which had attended our division, determined\r\nAdrian to keep all in one body. I, with an hundred men, went forward\r\nfirst as purveyor, taking the road of the C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Or, through Auxerre,\r\nDijon, Dole, over the Jura to Geneva. I was to make arrangements, at\r\nevery ten miles, for the accommodation of such numbers as I found the\r\ntown or village would receive, leaving behind a messenger with a\r\nwritten order, signifying how many were to be quartered there. The\r\nremainder of our tribe was then divided into bands of fifty each, every\r\ndivision containing eighteen men, and the remainder, consisting of\r\nwomen and children. Each of these was headed by an officer, who carried\r\nthe roll of names, by which they were each day to be mustered. If the\r\nnumbers were divided at night, in the morning those in the van waited\r\nfor those in the rear. At each of the large towns before mentioned, we\r\nwere all to assemble; and a conclave of the principal officers would\r\nhold council for the general weal. I went first, as I said; Adrian\r\nlast. His mother, with Clara and Evelyn under her protection, remained\r\nalso with him. Thus our order being determined, I departed. My plan was\r\nto go at first no further than Fontainebleau, where in a few days I\r\nshould be joined by Adrian, before I took flight again further\r\neastward.\r\n\r\nMy friend accompanied me a few miles from Versailles. He was sad; and,\r\nin a tone of unaccustomed despondency, uttered a prayer for our speedy\r\narrival among the Alps, accompanied with an expression of vain regret\r\nthat we were not already there. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can\r\nquicken our march; why adhere to a plan whose dilatory proceeding you\r\nalready disapprove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cit is too late now. A month ago, and we were\r\nmasters of ourselves; now,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he turned his face from me; though\r\ngathering twilight had already veiled its expression, he turned it yet\r\nmore away, as he added \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca man died of the plague last night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a smothered voice, then suddenly clasping his hands, he\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cSwiftly, most swiftly advances the last hour for us all; as\r\nthe stars vanish before the sun, so will his near approach destroy us.\r\nI have done my best; with grasping hands and impotent strength, I have\r\nhung on the wheel of the chariot of plague; but she drags me along with\r\nit, while, like Juggernaut, she proceeds crushing out the being of all\r\nwho strew the high road of life. Would that it were over\xe2\x80\x94would that her\r\nprocession achieved, we had all entered the tomb together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears streamed from his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAgain and again,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwill\r\nthe tragedy be acted; again I must hear the groans of the dying, the\r\nwailing of the survivors; again witness the pangs, which, consummating\r\nall, envelope an eternity in their evanescent existence. Why am I\r\nreserved for this? Why the tainted wether of the flock, am I not struck\r\nto earth among the first? It is hard, very hard, for one of woman born\r\nto endure all that I endure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHitherto, with an undaunted spirit, and an high feeling of duty and\r\nworth, Adrian had fulfilled his self-imposed task. I had contemplated\r\nhim with reverence, and a fruitless desire of imitation. I now offered\r\na few words of encouragement and sympathy. He hid his face in his\r\nhands, and while he strove to calm himself, he ejaculated, \xe2\x80\x9cFor a few\r\nmonths, yet for a few months more, let not, O God, my heart fail, or my\r\ncourage be bowed down; let not sights of intolerable misery madden this\r\nhalf-crazed brain, or cause this frail heart to beat against its\r\nprison-bound, so that it burst. I have believed it to be my destiny to\r\nguide and rule the last of the race of man, till death extinguish my\r\ngovernment; and to this destiny I submit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Verney, I pain you, but I will no longer complain. Now I am\r\nmyself again, or rather I am better than myself. You have known how\r\nfrom my childhood aspiring thoughts and high desires have warred with\r\ninherent disease and overstrained sensitiveness, till the latter became\r\nvictors. You know how I placed this wasted feeble hand on the abandoned\r\nhelm of human government. I have been visited at times by intervals of\r\nfluctuation; yet, until now, I have felt as if a superior and\r\nindefatigable spirit had taken up its abode within me or rather\r\nincorporated itself with my weaker being. The holy visitant has for a\r\ntime slept, perhaps to show me how powerless I am without its\r\ninspiration. Yet, stay for a while, O Power of goodness and strength;\r\ndisdain not yet this rent shrine of fleshly mortality, O immortal\r\nCapability! While one fellow creature remains to whom aid can be\r\nafforded, stay by and prop your shattered, falling engine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis vehemence, and voice broken by irrepressible sighs, sunk to my\r\nheart; his eyes gleamed in the gloom of night like two earthly stars;\r\nand, his form dilating, his countenance beaming, truly it almost seemed\r\nas if at his eloquent appeal a more than mortal spirit entered his\r\nframe, exalting him above humanity. He turned quickly towards me, and\r\nheld out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, Verney,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cbrother of my love,\r\nfarewell; no other weak expression must cross these lips, I am alive\r\nagain: to our tasks, to our combats with our unvanquishable foe, for to\r\nthe last I will struggle against her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grasped my hand, and bent a look on me, more fervent and animated\r\nthan any smile; then turning his horse\xe2\x80\x99s head, he touched the animal\r\nwith the spur, and was out of sight in a moment.\r\n\r\nA man last night had died of the plague. The quiver was not emptied,\r\nnor the bow unstrung. We stood as marks, while Parthian Pestilence\r\naimed and shot, insatiated by conquest, unobstructed by the heaps of\r\nslain. A sickness of the soul, contagious even to my physical\r\nmechanism, came over me. My knees knocked together, my teeth chattered,\r\nthe current of my blood, clotted by sudden cold, painfully forced its\r\nway from my heavy heart. I did not fear for myself, but it was misery\r\nto think that we could not even save this remnant. That those I loved\r\nmight in a few days be as clay-cold as Idris in her antique tomb; nor\r\ncould strength of body or energy of mind ward off the blow. A sense of\r\ndegradation came over me. Did God create man, merely in the end to\r\nbecome dead earth in the midst of healthful vegetating nature? Was he\r\nof no more account to his Maker, than a field of corn blighted in the\r\near? Were our proud dreams thus to fade? Our name was written \xe2\x80\x9ca little\r\nlower than the angels;\xe2\x80\x9d and, behold, we were no better than ephemera.\r\nWe had called ourselves the \xe2\x80\x9cparagon of animals,\xe2\x80\x9d and, lo! we were a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cquint-essence of dust.\xe2\x80\x9d We repined that the pyramids had outlasted the\r\nembalmed body of their builder. Alas! the mere shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s hut of straw\r\nwe passed on the road, contained in its structure the principle of\r\ngreater longevity than the whole race of man. How reconcile this sad\r\nchange to our past aspirations, to our apparent powers!\r\n\r\nSudden an internal voice, articulate and clear, seemed to say:\xe2\x80\x94Thus\r\nfrom eternity, it was decreed: the steeds that bear Time onwards had\r\nthis hour and this fulfilment enchained to them, since the void brought\r\nforth its burthen. Would you read backwards the unchangeable laws of\r\nNecessity?\r\n\r\nMother of the world! Servant of the Omnipotent! eternal, changeless\r\nNecessity! who with busy fingers sittest ever weaving the indissoluble\r\nchain of events!\xe2\x80\x94I will not murmur at thy acts. If my human mind cannot\r\nacknowledge that all that is, is right; yet since what is, must be, I\r\nwill sit amidst the ruins and smile. Truly we were not born to enjoy,\r\nbut to submit, and to hope.\r\n\r\nWill not the reader tire, if I should minutely describe our long-drawn\r\njourney from Paris to Geneva? If, day by day, I should record, in the\r\nform of a journal, the thronging miseries of our lot, could my hand\r\nwrite, or language afford words to express, the variety of our woe; the\r\nhustling and crowding of one deplorable event upon another? Patience,\r\noh reader! whoever thou art, wherever thou dwellest, whether of race\r\nspiritual, or, sprung from some surviving pair, thy nature will be\r\nhuman, thy habitation the earth; thou wilt here read of the acts of the\r\nextinct race, and wilt ask wonderingly, if they, who suffered what thou\r\nfindest recorded, were of frail flesh and soft organization like\r\nthyself. Most true, they were\xe2\x80\x94 weep therefore; for surely, solitary\r\nbeing, thou wilt be of gentle disposition; shed compassionate tears;\r\nbut the while lend thy attention to the tale, and learn the deeds and\r\nsufferings of thy predecessors.\r\n\r\nYet the last events that marked our progress through France were so\r\nfull of strange horror and gloomy misery, that I dare not pause too\r\nlong in the narration. If I were to dissect each incident, every small\r\nfragment of a second would contain an harrowing tale, whose minutest\r\nword would curdle the blood in thy young veins. It is right that I\r\nshould erect for thy instruction this monument of the foregone race;\r\nbut not that I should drag thee through the wards of an hospital, nor\r\nthe secret chambers of the charnel-house. This tale, therefore, shall\r\nbe rapidly unfolded. Images of destruction, pictures of despair, the\r\nprocession of the last triumph of death, shall be drawn before thee,\r\nswift as the rack driven by the north wind along the blotted splendour\r\nof the sky.\r\n\r\nWeed-grown fields, desolate towns, the wild approach of riderless\r\nhorses had now become habitual to my eyes; nay, sights far worse, of\r\nthe unburied dead, and human forms which were strewed on the road side,\r\nand on the steps of once frequented habitations, where,\r\n\r\n        Through the flesh that wastes away\r\nBeneath the parching sun, the whitening bones\r\nStart forth, and moulder in the sable dust.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nSights like these had become\xe2\x80\x94ah, woe the while! so familiar, that we\r\nhad ceased to shudder, or spur our stung horses to sudden speed, as we\r\npassed them. France in its best days, at least that part of France\r\nthrough which we travelled, had been a cultivated desert, and the\r\nabsence of enclosures, of cottages, and even of peasantry, was\r\nsaddening to a traveller from sunny Italy, or busy England. Yet the\r\ntowns were frequent and lively, and the cordial politeness and ready\r\nsmile of the wooden-shoed peasant restored good humour to the\r\nsplenetic. Now, the old woman sat no more at the door with her\r\ndistaff\xe2\x80\x94the lank beggar no longer asked charity in courtier-like\r\nphrase; nor on holidays did the peasantry thread with slow grace the\r\nmazes of the dance. Silence, melancholy bride of death, went in\r\nprocession with him from town to town through the spacious region.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Fontainebleau, and speedily prepared for the reception of\r\nour friends. On mustering our numbers for the night, three were found\r\nmissing. When I enquired for them, the man to whom I spoke, uttered the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cplague,\xe2\x80\x9d and fell at my feet in convulsions; he also was\r\ninfected. There were hard faces around me; for among my troop were\r\nsailors who had crossed the line times unnumbered, soldiers who, in\r\nRussia and far America, had suffered famine, cold and danger, and men\r\nstill sterner-featured, once nightly depredators in our over-grown\r\nmetropolis; men bred from their cradle to see the whole machine of\r\nsociety at work for their destruction. I looked round, and saw upon the\r\nfaces of all horror and despair written in glaring characters.\r\n\r\nWe passed four days at Fontainebleau. Several sickened and died, and in\r\nthe mean time neither Adrian nor any of our friends appeared. My own\r\ntroop was in commotion; to reach Switzerland, to plunge into rivers of\r\nsnow, and to dwell in caves of ice, became the mad desire of all. Yet\r\nwe had promised to wait for the Earl; and he came not. My people\r\ndemanded to be led forward\xe2\x80\x94 rebellion, if so we might call what was the\r\nmere casting away of straw-formed shackles, appeared manifestly among\r\nthem. They would away on the word without a leader. The only chance of\r\nsafety, the only hope of preservation from every form of indescribable\r\nsuffering, was our keeping together. I told them this; while the most\r\ndetermined among them answered with sullenness, that they could take\r\ncare of themselves, and replied to my entreaties with scoffs and\r\nmenaces.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the fifth day, a messenger arrived from Adrian, bearing\r\nletters, which directed us to proceed to Auxerre, and there await his\r\narrival, which would only be deferred for a few days. Such was the\r\ntenor of his public letters. Those privately delivered to me, detailed\r\nat length the difficulties of his situation, and left the arrangement\r\nof my future plans to my own discretion. His account of the state of\r\naffairs at Versailles was brief, but the oral communications of his\r\nmessenger filled up his omissions, and shewed me that perils of the\r\nmost frightful nature were gathering around him. At first the\r\nre-awakening of the plague had been concealed; but the number of deaths\r\nencreasing, the secret was divulged, and the destruction already\r\nachieved, was exaggerated by the fears of the survivors. Some\r\nemissaries of the enemy of mankind, the accursed Impostors, were among\r\nthem instilling their doctrine that safety and life could only be\r\nensured by submission to their chief; and they succeeded so well, that\r\nsoon, instead of desiring to proceed to Switzerland, the major part of\r\nthe multitude, weak-minded women, and dastardly men, desired to return\r\nto Paris, and, by ranging themselves under the banners of the so called\r\nprophet, and by a cowardly worship of the principle of evil, to\r\npurchase respite, as they hoped, from impending death. The discord and\r\ntumult induced by these conflicting fears and passions, detained\r\nAdrian. It required all his ardour in pursuit of an object, and his\r\npatience under difficulties, to calm and animate such a number of his\r\nfollowers, as might counterbalance the panic of the rest, and lead them\r\nback to the means from which alone safety could be derived. He had\r\nhoped immediately to follow me; but, being defeated in this intention,\r\nhe sent his messenger urging me to secure my own troop at such a\r\ndistance from Versailles, as to prevent the contagion of rebellion from\r\nreaching them; promising, at the same time, to join me the moment a\r\nfavourable occasion should occur, by means of which he could withdraw\r\nthe main body of the emigrants from the evil influence at present\r\nexercised over them.\r\n\r\nI was thrown into a most painful state of uncertainty by these\r\ncommunications. My first impulse was that we should all return to\r\nVersailles, there to assist in extricating our chief from his perils. I\r\naccordingly assembled my troop, and proposed to them this retrograde\r\nmovement, instead of the continuation of our journey to Auxerre. With\r\none voice they refused to comply. The notion circulated among them was,\r\nthat the ravages of the plague alone detained the Protector; they\r\nopposed his order to my request; they came to a resolve to proceed\r\nwithout me, should I refuse to accompany them. Argument and adjuration\r\nwere lost on these dastards. The continual diminution of their own\r\nnumbers, effected by pestilence, added a sting to their dislike of\r\ndelay; and my opposition only served to bring their resolution to a\r\ncrisis. That same evening they departed towards Auxerre. Oaths, as from\r\nsoldiers to their general, had been taken by them: these they broke. I\r\nalso had engaged myself not to desert them; it appeared to me inhuman\r\nto ground any infraction of my word on theirs. The same spirit that\r\ncaused them to rebel against me, would impel them to desert each other;\r\nand the most dreadful sufferings would be the consequence of their\r\njourney in their present unordered and chiefless array. These feelings\r\nfor a time were paramount; and, in obedience to them, I accompanied the\r\nrest towards Auxerre. We arrived the same night at\r\nVilleneuve-la-Guiard, a town at the distance of four posts from\r\nFontainebleau. When my companions had retired to rest, and I was left\r\nalone to revolve and ruminate upon the intelligence I received of\r\nAdrian\xe2\x80\x99s situation, another view of the subject presented itself to me.\r\nWhat was I doing, and what was the object of my present movements?\r\nApparently I was to lead this troop of selfish and lawless men towards\r\nSwitzerland, leaving behind my family and my selected friend, which,\r\nsubject as they were hourly to the death that threatened to all, I\r\nmight never see again. Was it not my first duty to assist the\r\nProtector, setting an example of attachment and duty? At a crisis, such\r\nas the one I had reached, it is very difficult to balance nicely\r\nopposing interests, and that towards which our inclinations lead us,\r\nobstinately assumes the appearance of selfishness, even when we\r\nmeditate a sacrifice. We are easily led at such times to make a\r\ncompromise of the question; and this was my present resource. I\r\nresolved that very night to ride to Versailles; if I found affairs less\r\ndesperate than I now deemed them, I would return without delay to my\r\ntroop; I had a vague idea that my arrival at that town, would occasion\r\nsome sensation more or less strong, of which we might profit, for the\r\npurpose of leading forward the vacillating multitude\xe2\x80\x94at least no time\r\nwas to be lost\xe2\x80\x94I visited the stables, I saddled my favourite horse, and\r\nvaulting on his back, without giving myself time for further reflection\r\nor hesitation, quitted Villeneuve-la-Guiard on my return to Versailles.\r\n\r\nI was glad to escape from my rebellious troop, and to lose sight for a\r\ntime, of the strife of evil with good, where the former for ever\r\nremained triumphant. I was stung almost to madness by my uncertainty\r\nconcerning the fate of Adrian, and grew reckless of any event, except\r\nwhat might lose or preserve my unequalled friend. With an heavy heart,\r\nthat sought relief in the rapidity of my course, I rode through the\r\nnight to Versailles. I spurred my horse, who addressed his free limbs\r\nto speed, and tossed his gallant head in pride. The constellations\r\nreeled swiftly by, swiftly each tree and stone and landmark fled past\r\nmy onward career. I bared my head to the rushing wind, which bathed my\r\nbrow in delightful coolness. As I lost sight of Villeneuve-la-Guiard, I\r\nforgot the sad drama of human misery; methought it was happiness enough\r\nto live, sensitive the while of the beauty of the verdure-clad earth,\r\nthe star-bespangled sky, and the tameless wind that lent animation to\r\nthe whole. My horse grew tired\xe2\x80\x94and I, forgetful of his fatigue, still\r\nas he lagged, cheered him with my voice, and urged him with the spur.\r\nHe was a gallant animal, and I did not wish to exchange him for any\r\nchance beast I might light on, leaving him never to be refound. All\r\nnight we went forward; in the morning he became sensible that we\r\napproached Versailles, to reach which as his home, he mustered his\r\nflagging strength. The distance we had come was not less than fifty\r\nmiles, yet he shot down the long Boulevards swift as an arrow; poor\r\nfellow, as I dismounted at the gate of the castle, he sunk on his\r\nknees, his eyes were covered with a film, he fell on his side, a few\r\ngasps inflated his noble chest, and he died. I saw him expire with an\r\nanguish, unaccountable even to myself, the spasm was as the wrenching\r\nof some limb in agonizing torture, but it was brief as it was\r\nintolerable. I forgot him, as I swiftly darted through the open portal,\r\nand up the majestic stairs of this castle of victories\xe2\x80\x94heard Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94O fool! O woman nurtured, effeminate and contemptible being\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nheard his voice, and answered it with convulsive shrieks; I rushed into\r\nthe Hall of Hercules, where he stood surrounded by a crowd, whose eyes,\r\nturned in wonder on me, reminded me that on the stage of the world, a\r\nman must repress such girlish extacies. I would have given worlds to\r\nhave embraced him; I dared not\xe2\x80\x94Half in exhaustion, half voluntarily, I\r\nthrew myself at my length on the ground\xe2\x80\x94 dare I disclose the truth to\r\nthe gentle offspring of solitude? I did so, that I might kiss the dear\r\nand sacred earth he trod.\r\n\r\nI found everything in a state of tumult. An emissary of the leader of\r\nthe elect, had been so worked up by his chief, and by his own fanatical\r\ncreed, as to make an attempt on the life of the Protector and preserver\r\nof lost mankind. His hand was arrested while in the act of poignarding\r\nthe Earl; this circumstance had caused the clamour I heard on my\r\narrival at the castle, and the confused assembly of persons that I\r\nfound assembled in the Salle d\xe2\x80\x99Hercule. Although superstition and\r\ndemoniac fury had crept among the emigrants, yet several adhered with\r\nfidelity to their noble chieftain; and many, whose faith and love had\r\nbeen unhinged by fear, felt all their latent affection rekindled by\r\nthis detestable attempt. A phalanx of faithful breasts closed round\r\nhim; the wretch, who, although a prisoner and in bonds, vaunted his\r\ndesign, and madly claimed the crown of martyrdom, would have been torn\r\nto pieces, had not his intended victim interposed. Adrian, springing\r\nforward, shielded him with his own person, and commanded with energy\r\nthe submission of his infuriate friends\xe2\x80\x94at this moment I had entered.\r\n\r\nDiscipline and peace were at length restored in the castle; and then\r\nAdrian went from house to house, from troop to troop, to soothe the\r\ndisturbed minds of his followers, and recall them to their ancient\r\nobedience. But the fear of immediate death was still rife amongst these\r\nsurvivors of a world\xe2\x80\x99s destruction; the horror occasioned by the\r\nattempted assassination, past away; each eye turned towards Paris. Men\r\nlove a prop so well, that they will lean on a pointed poisoned spear;\r\nand such was he, the impostor, who, with fear of hell for his scourge,\r\nmost ravenous wolf, played the driver to a credulous flock.\r\n\r\nIt was a moment of suspense, that shook even the resolution of the\r\nunyielding friend of man. Adrian for one moment was about to give in,\r\nto cease the struggle, and quit, with a few adherents, the deluded\r\ncrowd, leaving them a miserable prey to their passions, and to the\r\nworse tyrant who excited them. But again, after a brief fluctuation of\r\npurpose, he resumed his courage and resolves, sustained by the\r\nsingleness of his purpose, and the untried spirit of benevolence which\r\nanimated him. At this moment, as an omen of excellent import, his\r\nwretched enemy pulled destruction on his head, destroying with his own\r\nhands the dominion he had erected.\r\n\r\nHis grand hold upon the minds of men, took its rise from the doctrine\r\ninculcated by him, that those who believed in, and followed him, were\r\nthe remnant to be saved, while all the rest of mankind were marked out\r\nfor death. Now, at the time of the Flood, the omnipotent repented him\r\nthat he had created man, and as then with water, now with the arrows of\r\npestilence, was about to annihilate all, except those who obeyed his\r\ndecrees, promulgated by the _ipse dixit_ prophet. It is impossible to\r\nsay on what foundations this man built his hopes of being able to carry\r\non such an imposture. It is likely that he was fully aware of the lie\r\nwhich murderous nature might give to his assertions, and believed it to\r\nbe the cast of a die, whether he should in future ages be reverenced as\r\nan inspired delegate from heaven, or be recognized as an impostor by\r\nthe present dying generation. At any rate he resolved to keep up the\r\ndrama to the last act. When, on the first approach of summer, the fatal\r\ndisease again made its ravages among the followers of Adrian, the\r\nimpostor exultingly proclaimed the exemption of his own congregation\r\nfrom the universal calamity. He was believed; his followers, hitherto\r\nshut up in Paris, now came to Versailles. Mingling with the coward band\r\nthere assembled, they reviled their admirable leader, and asserted\r\ntheir own superiority and exemption. At length the plague, slow-footed,\r\nbut sure in her noiseless advance, destroyed the illusion, invading the\r\ncongregation of the elect, and showering promiscuous death among them.\r\nTheir leader endeavoured to conceal this event; he had a few followers,\r\nwho, admitted into the arcana of his wickedness, could help him in the\r\nexecution of his nefarious designs. Those who sickened were immediately\r\nand quietly withdrawn, the cord and a midnight-grave disposed of them\r\nfor ever; while some plausible excuse was given for their absence. At\r\nlast a female, whose maternal vigilance subdued even the effects of the\r\nnarcotics administered to her, became a witness of their murderous\r\ndesigns on her only child. Mad with horror, she would have burst among\r\nher deluded fellow-victims, and, wildly shrieking, have awaked the dull\r\near of night with the history of the fiend-like crime; when the\r\nImpostor, in his last act of rage and desperation, plunged a poignard\r\nin her bosom. Thus wounded to death, her garments dripping with her own\r\nlife-blood, bearing her strangled infant in her arms, beautiful and\r\nyoung as she was, Juliet, (for it was she) denounced to the host of\r\ndeceived believers, the wickedness of their leader. He saw the aghast\r\nlooks of her auditors, changing from horror to fury\xe2\x80\x94the names of those\r\nalready sacrificed were echoed by their relatives, now assured of their\r\nloss. The wretch with that energy of purpose, which had borne him thus\r\nfar in his guilty career, saw his danger, and resolved to evade the\r\nworst forms of it\xe2\x80\x94he rushed on one of the foremost, seized a pistol\r\nfrom his girdle, and his loud laugh of derision mingled with the report\r\nof the weapon with which he destroyed himself.\r\n\r\nThey left his miserable remains even where they lay; they placed the\r\ncorpse of poor Juliet and her babe upon a bier, and all, with hearts\r\nsubdued to saddest regret, in long procession walked towards\r\nVersailles. They met troops of those who had quitted the kindly\r\nprotection of Adrian, and were journeying to join the fanatics. The\r\ntale of horror was recounted\xe2\x80\x94all turned back; and thus at last,\r\naccompanied by the undiminished numbers of surviving humanity, and\r\npreceded by the mournful emblem of their recovered reason, they\r\nappeared before Adrian, and again and for ever vowed obedience to his\r\ncommands, and fidelity to his cause.\r\n\r\n [22] Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x94Julius C\xc3\xa6sar.\r\n\r\n\r\n [23] Elton\xe2\x80\x99s Translation of Hesiod\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cShield of Hercules.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese events occupied so much time, that June had numbered more than\r\nhalf its days, before we again commenced our long-protracted journey.\r\nThe day after my return to Versailles, six men, from among those I had\r\nleft at Villeneuve-la-Guiard, arrived, with intelligence, that the rest\r\nof the troop had already proceeded towards Switzerland. We went forward\r\nin the same track.\r\n\r\nIt is strange, after an interval of time, to look back on a period,\r\nwhich, though short in itself, appeared, when in actual progress, to be\r\ndrawn out interminably. By the end of July we entered Dijon; by the end\r\nof July those hours, days, and weeks had mingled with the ocean of\r\nforgotten time, which in their passage teemed with fatal events and\r\nagonizing sorrow. By the end of July, little more than a month had gone\r\nby, if man\xe2\x80\x99s life were measured by the rising and setting of the sun:\r\nbut, alas! in that interval ardent youth had become grey-haired;\r\nfurrows deep and uneraseable were trenched in the blooming cheek of the\r\nyoung mother; the elastic limbs of early manhood, paralyzed as by the\r\nburthen of years, assumed the decrepitude of age. Nights passed, during\r\nwhose fatal darkness the sun grew old before it rose; and burning days,\r\nto cool whose baleful heat the balmy eve, lingering far in eastern\r\nclimes, came lagging and ineffectual; days, in which the dial, radiant\r\nin its noon-day station, moved not its shadow the space of a little\r\nhour, until a whole life of sorrow had brought the sufferer to an\r\nuntimely grave.\r\n\r\nWe departed from Versailles fifteen hundred souls. We set out on the\r\neighteenth of June. We made a long procession, in which was contained\r\nevery dear relationship, or tie of love, that existed in human society.\r\nFathers and husbands, with guardian care, gathered their dear relatives\r\naround them; wives and mothers looked for support to the manly form\r\nbeside them, and then with tender anxiety bent their eyes on the infant\r\ntroop around. They were sad, but not hopeless. Each thought that\r\nsomeone would be saved; each, with that pertinacious optimism, which to\r\nthe last characterized our human nature, trusted that their beloved\r\nfamily would be the one preserved.\r\n\r\nWe passed through France, and found it empty of inhabitants. Some one\r\nor two natives survived in the larger towns, which they roamed through\r\nlike ghosts; we received therefore small encrease to our numbers, and\r\nsuch decrease through death, that at last it became easier to count the\r\nscanty list of survivors. As we never deserted any of the sick, until\r\ntheir death permitted us to commit their remains to the shelter of a\r\ngrave, our journey was long, while every day a frightful gap was made\r\nin our troop\xe2\x80\x94they died by tens, by fifties, by hundreds. No mercy was\r\nshewn by death; we ceased to expect it, and every day welcomed the sun\r\nwith the feeling that we might never see it rise again.\r\n\r\nThe nervous terrors and fearful visions which had scared us during the\r\nspring, continued to visit our coward troop during this sad journey.\r\nEvery evening brought its fresh creation of spectres; a ghost was\r\ndepicted by every blighted tree; and appalling shapes were manufactured\r\nfrom each shaggy bush. By degrees these common marvels palled on us,\r\nand then other wonders were called into being. Once it was confidently\r\nasserted, that the sun rose an hour later than its seasonable time;\r\nagain it was discovered that he grew paler and paler; that shadows took\r\nan uncommon appearance. It was impossible to have imagined, during the\r\nusual calm routine of life men had before experienced, the terrible\r\neffects produced by these extravagant delusions: in truth, of such\r\nlittle worth are our senses, when unsupported by concurring testimony,\r\nthat it was with the utmost difficulty I kept myself free from the\r\nbelief in supernatural events, to which the major part of our people\r\nreadily gave credit. Being one sane amidst a crowd of the mad, I hardly\r\ndared assert to my own mind, that the vast luminary had undergone no\r\nchange\xe2\x80\x94that the shadows of night were unthickened by innumerable shapes\r\nof awe and terror; or that the wind, as it sung in the trees, or\r\nwhistled round an empty building, was not pregnant with sounds of\r\nwailing and despair. Sometimes realities took ghostly shapes; and it\r\nwas impossible for one\xe2\x80\x99s blood not to curdle at the perception of an\r\nevident mixture of what we knew to be true, with the visionary\r\nsemblance of all that we feared.\r\n\r\nOnce, at the dusk of the evening, we saw a figure all in white,\r\napparently of more than human stature, flourishing about the road, now\r\nthrowing up its arms, now leaping to an astonishing height in the air,\r\nthen turning round several times successively, then raising itself to\r\nits full height and gesticulating violently. Our troop, on the alert to\r\ndiscover and believe in the supernatural, made a halt at some distance\r\nfrom this shape; and, as it became darker, there was something\r\nappalling even to the incredulous, in the lonely spectre, whose\r\ngambols, if they hardly accorded with spiritual dignity, were beyond\r\nhuman powers. Now it leapt right up in the air, now sheer over a high\r\nhedge, and was again the moment after in the road before us. By the\r\ntime I came up, the fright experienced by the spectators of this\r\nghostly exhibition, began to manifest itself in the flight of some, and\r\nthe close huddling together of the rest. Our goblin now perceived us;\r\nhe approached, and, as we drew reverentially back, made a low bow. The\r\nsight was irresistibly ludicrous even to our hapless band, and his\r\npoliteness was hailed by a shout of laughter;\xe2\x80\x94then, again springing up,\r\nas a last effort, it sunk to the ground, and became almost invisible\r\nthrough the dusky night. This circumstance again spread silence and\r\nfear through the troop; the more courageous at length advanced, and,\r\nraising the dying wretch, discovered the tragic explanation of this\r\nwild scene. It was an opera-dancer, and had been one of the troop which\r\ndeserted from Villeneuve-la-Guiard: falling sick, he had been deserted\r\nby his companions; in an access of delirium he had fancied himself on\r\nthe stage, and, poor fellow, his dying sense eagerly accepted the last\r\nhuman applause that could ever be bestowed on his grace and agility.\r\n\r\nAt another time we were haunted for several days by an apparition, to\r\nwhich our people gave the appellation of the Black Spectre. We never\r\nsaw it except at evening, when his coal black steed, his mourning\r\ndress, and plume of black feathers, had a majestic and awe-striking\r\nappearance; his face, one said, who had seen it for a moment, was ashy\r\npale; he had lingered far behind the rest of his troop, and suddenly at\r\na turn in the road, saw the Black Spectre coming towards him; he hid\r\nhimself in fear, and the horse and his rider slowly past, while the\r\nmoonbeams fell on the face of the latter, displaying its unearthly hue.\r\nSometimes at dead of night, as we watched the sick, we heard one\r\ngalloping through the town; it was the Black Spectre come in token of\r\ninevitable death. He grew giant tall to vulgar eyes; an icy atmosphere,\r\nthey said, surrounded him; when he was heard, all animals shuddered,\r\nand the dying knew that their last hour was come. It was Death himself,\r\nthey declared, come visibly to seize on subject earth, and quell at\r\nonce our decreasing numbers, sole rebels to his law. One day at noon,\r\nwe saw a dark mass on the road before us, and, coming up, beheld the\r\nBlack Spectre fallen from his horse, lying in the agonies of disease\r\nupon the ground. He did not survive many hours; and his last words\r\ndisclosed the secret of his mysterious conduct. He was a French noble\r\nof distinction, who, from the effects of plague, had been left alone in\r\nhis district; during many months, he had wandered from town to town,\r\nfrom province to province, seeking some survivor for a companion, and\r\nabhorring the loneliness to which he was condemned. When he discovered\r\nour troop, fear of contagion conquered his love of society. He dared\r\nnot join us, yet he could not resolve to lose sight of us, sole human\r\nbeings who besides himself existed in wide and fertile France; so he\r\naccompanied us in the spectral guise I have described, till pestilence\r\ngathered him to a larger congregation, even that of Dead Mankind.\r\n\r\nIt had been well, if such vain terrors could have distracted our\r\nthoughts from more tangible evils. But these were too dreadful and too\r\nmany not to force themselves into every thought, every moment, of our\r\nlives. We were obliged to halt at different periods for days together,\r\ntill another and yet another was consigned as a clod to the vast clod\r\nwhich had been once our living mother. Thus we continued travelling\r\nduring the hottest season; and it was not till the first of August,\r\nthat we, the emigrants,\xe2\x80\x94reader, there were just eighty of us in\r\nnumber,\xe2\x80\x94entered the gates of Dijon.\r\n\r\nWe had expected this moment with eagerness, for now we had accomplished\r\nthe worst part of our drear journey, and Switzerland was near at hand.\r\nYet how could we congratulate ourselves on any event thus imperfectly\r\nfulfilled? Were these miserable beings, who, worn and wretched, passed\r\nin sorrowful procession, the sole remnants of the race of man, which,\r\nlike a flood, had once spread over and possessed the whole earth? It\r\nhad come down clear and unimpeded from its primal mountain source in\r\nArarat, and grew from a puny streamlet to a vast perennial river,\r\ngeneration after generation flowing on ceaselessly. The same, but\r\ndiversified, it grew, and swept onwards towards the absorbing ocean,\r\nwhose dim shores we now reached. It had been the mere plaything of\r\nnature, when first it crept out of uncreative void into light; but\r\nthought brought forth power and knowledge; and, clad with these, the\r\nrace of man assumed dignity and authority. It was then no longer the\r\nmere gardener of earth, or the shepherd of her flocks; \xe2\x80\x9cit carried with\r\nit an imposing and majestic aspect; it had a pedigree and illustrious\r\nancestors; it had its gallery of portraits, its monumental\r\ninscriptions, its records and titles.\xe2\x80\x9d[24]\r\n\r\nThis was all over, now that the ocean of death had sucked in the\r\nslackening tide, and its source was dried up. We first had bidden adieu\r\nto the state of things which having existed many thousand years, seemed\r\neternal; such a state of government, obedience, traffic, and domestic\r\nintercourse, as had moulded our hearts and capacities, as far back as\r\nmemory could reach. Then to patriotic zeal, to the arts, to reputation,\r\nto enduring fame, to the name of country, we had bidden farewell. We\r\nsaw depart all hope of retrieving our ancient state\xe2\x80\x94all expectation,\r\nexcept the feeble one of saving our individual lives from the wreck of\r\nthe past. To preserve these we had quitted England\xe2\x80\x94England, no more;\r\nfor without her children, what name could that barren island claim?\r\nWith tenacious grasp we clung to such rule and order as could best save\r\nus; trusting that, if a little colony could be preserved, that would\r\nsuffice at some remoter period to restore the lost community of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nBut the game is up! We must all die; nor leave survivor nor heir to the\r\nwide inheritance of earth. We must all die! The species of man must\r\nperish; his frame of exquisite workmanship; the wondrous mechanism of\r\nhis senses; the noble proportion of his godlike limbs; his mind, the\r\nthroned king of these; must perish. Will the earth still keep her place\r\namong the planets; will she still journey with unmarked regularity\r\nround the sun; will the seasons change, the trees adorn themselves with\r\nleaves, and flowers shed their fragrance, in solitude? Will the\r\nmountains remain unmoved, and streams still keep a downward course\r\ntowards the vast abyss; will the tides rise and fall, and the winds fan\r\nuniversal nature; will beasts pasture, birds fly, and fishes swim, when\r\nman, the lord, possessor, perceiver, and recorder of all these things,\r\nhas passed away, as though he had never been? O, what mockery is this!\r\nSurely death is not death, and humanity is not extinct; but merely\r\npassed into other shapes, unsubjected to our perceptions. Death is a\r\nvast portal, an high road to life: let us hasten to pass; let us exist\r\nno more in this living death, but die that we may live!\r\n\r\nWe had longed with inexpressible earnestness to reach Dijon, since we\r\nhad fixed on it, as a kind of station in our progress. But now we\r\nentered it with a torpor more painful than acute suffering. We had come\r\nslowly but irrevocably to the opinion, that our utmost efforts would\r\nnot preserve one human being alive. We took our hands therefore away\r\nfrom the long grasped rudder; and the frail vessel on which we floated,\r\nseemed, the government over her suspended, to rush, prow foremost, into\r\nthe dark abyss of the billows. A gush of grief, a wanton profusion of\r\ntears, and vain laments, and overflowing tenderness, and passionate but\r\nfruitless clinging to the priceless few that remained, was followed by\r\nlanguor and recklessness.\r\n\r\nDuring this disastrous journey we lost all those, not of our own\r\nfamily, to whom we had particularly attached ourselves among the\r\nsurvivors. It were not well to fill these pages with a mere catalogue\r\nof losses; yet I cannot refrain from this last mention of those\r\nprincipally dear to us. The little girl whom Adrian had rescued from\r\nutter desertion, during our ride through London on the twentieth of\r\nNovember, died at Auxerre. The poor child had attached herself greatly\r\nto us; and the suddenness of her death added to our sorrow. In the\r\nmorning we had seen her apparently in health\xe2\x80\x94in the evening, Lucy,\r\nbefore we retired to rest, visited our quarters to say that she was\r\ndead. Poor Lucy herself only survived, till we arrived at Dijon. She\r\nhad devoted herself throughout to the nursing the sick, and attending\r\nthe friendless. Her excessive exertions brought on a slow fever, which\r\nended in the dread disease whose approach soon released her from her\r\nsufferings. She had throughout been endeared to us by her good\r\nqualities, by her ready and cheerful execution of every duty, and mild\r\nacquiescence in every turn of adversity. When we consigned her to the\r\ntomb, we seemed at the same time to bid a final adieu to those\r\npeculiarly feminine virtues conspicuous in her; uneducated and\r\nunpretending as she was, she was distinguished for patience,\r\nforbearance, and sweetness. These, with all their train of qualities\r\npeculiarly English, would never again be revived for us. This type of\r\nall that was most worthy of admiration in her class among my\r\ncountrywomen, was placed under the sod of desert France; and it was as\r\na second separation from our country to have lost sight of her for\r\never.\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Windsor died during our abode at Dijon. One morning I\r\nwas informed that she wished to see me. Her message made me remember,\r\nthat several days had elapsed since I had last seen her. Such a\r\ncircumstance had often occurred during our journey, when I remained\r\nbehind to watch to their close the last moments of some one of our\r\nhapless comrades, and the rest of the troop past on before me. But\r\nthere was something in the manner of her messenger, that made me\r\nsuspect that all was not right. A caprice of the imagination caused me\r\nto conjecture that some ill had occurred to Clara or Evelyn, rather\r\nthan to this aged lady. Our fears, for ever on the stretch, demanded a\r\nnourishment of horror; and it seemed too natural an occurrence, too\r\nlike past times, for the old to die before the young. I found the\r\nvenerable mother of my Idris lying on a couch, her tall emaciated\r\nfigure stretched out; her face fallen away, from which the nose stood\r\nout in sharp profile, and her large dark eyes, hollow and deep, gleamed\r\nwith such light as may edge a thunder cloud at sun-set. All was\r\nshrivelled and dried up, except these lights; her voice too was\r\nfearfully changed, as she spoke to me at intervals. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is selfish in me to have asked you to visit the old woman\r\nagain, before she dies: yet perhaps it would have been a greater shock\r\nto hear suddenly that I was dead, than to see me first thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI clasped her shrivelled hand: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you indeed so ill?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not perceive death in my face,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, \xe2\x80\x9cit is strange; I\r\nought to have expected this, and yet I confess it has taken me unaware.\r\nI never clung to life, or enjoyed it, till these last months, while\r\namong those I senselessly deserted: and it is hard to be snatched\r\nimmediately away. I am glad, however, that I am not a victim of the\r\nplague; probably I should have died at this hour, though the world had\r\ncontinued as it was in my youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with difficulty, and I perceived that she regretted the\r\nnecessity of death, even more than she cared to confess. Yet she had\r\nnot to complain of an undue shortening of existence; her faded person\r\nshewed that life had naturally spent itself. We had been alone at\r\nfirst; now Clara entered; the Countess turned to her with a smile, and\r\ntook the hand of this lovely child; her roseate palm and snowy fingers,\r\ncontrasted with relaxed fibres and yellow hue of those of her aged\r\nfriend; she bent to kiss her, touching her withered mouth with the\r\nwarm, full lips of youth. \xe2\x80\x9cVerney,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Countess, \xe2\x80\x9cI need not\r\nrecommend this dear girl to you, for your own sake you will preserve\r\nher. Were the world as it was, I should have a thousand sage\r\nprecautions to impress, that one so sensitive, good, and beauteous,\r\nmight escape the dangers that used to lurk for the destruction of the\r\nfair and excellent. This is all nothing now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI commit you, my kind nurse, to your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s care; to yours I entrust\r\nthe dearest relic of my better self. Be to Adrian, sweet one, what you\r\nhave been to me\xe2\x80\x94enliven his sadness with your sprightly sallies; sooth\r\nhis anguish by your sober and inspired converse, when he is dying;\r\nnurse him as you have done me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClara burst into tears; \xe2\x80\x9cKind girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Countess, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not weep\r\nfor me. Many dear friends are left to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clara, \xe2\x80\x9cyou talk of their dying also. This is indeed\r\ncruel \xe2\x80\x94how could I live, if they were gone? If it were possible for my\r\nbeloved protector to die before me, I could not nurse him; I could only\r\ndie too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe venerable lady survived this scene only twenty-four hours. She was\r\nthe last tie binding us to the ancient state of things. It was\r\nimpossible to look on her, and not call to mind in their wonted guise,\r\nevents and persons, as alien to our present situation as the disputes\r\nof Themistocles and Aristides, or the wars of the two roses in our\r\nnative land. The crown of England had pressed her brow; the memory of\r\nmy father and his misfortunes, the vain struggles of the late king, the\r\nimages of Raymond, Evadne, and Perdita, who had lived in the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprime, were brought vividly before us. We consigned her to the\r\noblivious tomb with reluctance; and when I turned from her grave, Janus\r\nveiled his retrospective face; that which gazed on future generations\r\nhad long lost its faculty.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining a week at Dijon, until thirty of our number deserted\r\nthe vacant ranks of life, we continued our way towards Geneva. At noon\r\non the second day we arrived at the foot of Jura. We halted here during\r\nthe heat of the day. Here fifty human beings\xe2\x80\x94fifty, the only human\r\nbeings that survived of the food-teeming earth, assembled to read in\r\nthe looks of each other ghastly plague, or wasting sorrow, desperation,\r\nor worse, carelessness of future or present evil. Here we assembled at\r\nthe foot of this mighty wall of mountain, under a spreading walnut\r\ntree; a brawling stream refreshed the green sward by its sprinkling;\r\nand the busy grasshopper chirped among the thyme. We clustered together\r\na group of wretched sufferers. A mother cradled in her enfeebled arms\r\nthe child, last of many, whose glazed eye was about to close for ever.\r\nHere beauty, late glowing in youthful lustre and consciousness, now wan\r\nand neglected, knelt fanning with uncertain motion the beloved, who lay\r\nstriving to paint his features, distorted by illness, with a thankful\r\nsmile. There an hard-featured, weather-worn veteran, having prepared\r\nhis meal, sat, his head dropped on his breast, the useless knife\r\nfalling from his grasp, his limbs utterly relaxed, as thought of wife\r\nand child, and dearest relative, all lost, passed across his\r\nrecollection. There sat a man who for forty years had basked in\r\nfortune\xe2\x80\x99s tranquil sunshine; he held the hand of his last hope, his\r\nbeloved daughter, who had just attained womanhood; and he gazed on her\r\nwith anxious eyes, while she tried to rally her fainting spirit to\r\ncomfort him. Here a servant, faithful to the last, though dying, waited\r\non one, who, though still erect with health, gazed with gasping fear on\r\nthe variety of woe around.\r\n\r\nAdrian stood leaning against a tree; he held a book in his hand, but\r\nhis eye wandered from the pages, and sought mine; they mingled a\r\nsympathetic glance; his looks confessed that his thoughts had quitted\r\nthe inanimate print, for pages more pregnant with meaning, more\r\nabsorbing, spread out before him. By the margin of the stream, apart\r\nfrom all, in a tranquil nook, where the purling brook kissed the green\r\nsward gently, Clara and Evelyn were at play, sometimes beating the\r\nwater with large boughs, sometimes watching the summer-flies that\r\nsported upon it. Evelyn now chased a butterfly\xe2\x80\x94now gathered a flower\r\nfor his cousin; and his laughing cherub-face and clear brow told of the\r\nlight heart that beat in his bosom. Clara, though she endeavoured to\r\ngive herself up to his amusement, often forgot him, as she turned to\r\nobserve Adrian and me. She was now fourteen, and retained her childish\r\nappearance, though in height a woman; she acted the part of the\r\ntenderest mother to my little orphan boy; to see her playing with him,\r\nor attending silently and submissively on our wants, you thought only\r\nof her admirable docility and patience; but, in her soft eyes, and the\r\nveined curtains that veiled them, in the clearness of her marmoreal\r\nbrow, and the tender expression of her lips, there was an intelligence\r\nand beauty that at once excited admiration and love.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun had sunk towards the precipitate west, and the evening\r\nshadows grew long, we prepared to ascend the mountain. The attention\r\nthat we were obliged to pay to the sick, made our progress slow. The\r\nwinding road, though steep, presented a confined view of rocky fields\r\nand hills, each hiding the other, till our farther ascent disclosed\r\nthem in succession. We were seldom shaded from the declining sun, whose\r\nslant beams were instinct with exhausting heat. There are times when\r\nminor difficulties grow gigantic \xe2\x80\x94times, when as the Hebrew poet\r\nexpressively terms it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe grasshopper is a burthen;\xe2\x80\x9d so was it with\r\nour ill fated party this evening. Adrian, usually the first to rally\r\nhis spirits, and dash foremost into fatigue and hardship, with relaxed\r\nlimbs and declined head, the reins hanging loosely in his grasp, left\r\nthe choice of the path to the instinct of his horse, now and then\r\npainfully rousing himself, when the steepness of the ascent required\r\nthat he should keep his seat with better care. Fear and horror\r\nencompassed me. Did his languid air attest that he also was struck with\r\ncontagion? How long, when I look on this matchless specimen of\r\nmortality, may I perceive that his thought answers mine? how long will\r\nthose limbs obey the kindly spirit within? how long will light and life\r\ndwell in the eyes of this my sole remaining friend? Thus pacing slowly,\r\neach hill surmounted, only presented another to be ascended; each\r\njutting corner only discovered another, sister to the last, endlessly.\r\nSometimes the pressure of sickness in one among us, caused the whole\r\ncavalcade to halt; the call for water, the eagerly expressed wish to\r\nrepose; the cry of pain, and suppressed sob of the mourner\xe2\x80\x94such were\r\nthe sorrowful attendants of our passage of the Jura.\r\n\r\nAdrian had gone first. I saw him, while I was detained by the loosening\r\nof a girth, struggling with the upward path, seemingly more difficult\r\nthan any we had yet passed. He reached the top, and the dark outline of\r\nhis figure stood in relief against the sky. He seemed to behold\r\nsomething unexpected and wonderful; for, pausing, his head stretched\r\nout, his arms for a moment extended, he seemed to give an All Hail! to\r\nsome new vision. Urged by curiosity, I hurried to join him. After\r\nbattling for many tedious minutes with the precipice, the same scene\r\npresented itself to me, which had wrapt him in extatic wonder.\r\n\r\nNature, or nature\xe2\x80\x99s favourite, this lovely earth, presented her most\r\nunrivalled beauties in resplendent and sudden exhibition. Below, far,\r\nfar below, even as it were in the yawning abyss of the ponderous globe,\r\nlay the placid and azure expanse of lake Leman; vine-covered hills\r\nhedged it in, and behind dark mountains in cone-like shape, or\r\nirregular cyclopean wall, served for further defence. But beyond, and\r\nhigh above all, as if the spirits of the air had suddenly unveiled\r\ntheir bright abodes, placed in scaleless altitude in the stainless sky,\r\nheaven-kissing, companions of the unattainable ether, were the glorious\r\nAlps, clothed in dazzling robes of light by the setting sun. And, as if\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s wonders were never to be exhausted, their vast immensities,\r\ntheir jagged crags, and roseate painting, appeared again in the lake\r\nbelow, dipping their proud heights beneath the unruffled waves\xe2\x80\x94palaces\r\nfor the Naiads of the placid waters. Towns and villages lay scattered\r\nat the foot of Jura, which, with dark ravine, and black promontories,\r\nstretched its roots into the watery expanse beneath. Carried away by\r\nwonder, I forgot the death of man, and the living and beloved friend\r\nnear me. When I turned, I saw tears streaming from his eyes; his thin\r\nhands pressed one against the other, his animated countenance beaming\r\nwith admiration; \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, oh heart, whisperest\r\nthou of grief to me? Drink in the beauty of that scene, and possess\r\ndelight beyond what a fabled paradise could afford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy degrees, our whole party surmounting the steep, joined us, not one\r\namong them, but gave visible tokens of admiration, surpassing any\r\nbefore experienced. One cried, \xe2\x80\x9cGod reveals his heaven to us; we may\r\ndie blessed.\xe2\x80\x9d Another and another, with broken exclamations, and\r\nextravagant phrases, endeavoured to express the intoxicating effect of\r\nthis wonder of nature. So we remained awhile, lightened of the pressing\r\nburthen of fate, forgetful of death, into whose night we were about to\r\nplunge; no longer reflecting that our eyes now and for ever were and\r\nwould be the only ones which might perceive the divine magnificence of\r\nthis terrestrial exhibition. An enthusiastic transport, akin to\r\nhappiness, burst, like a sudden ray from the sun, on our darkened life.\r\nPrecious attribute of woe-worn humanity! that can snatch extatic\r\nemotion, even from under the very share and harrow, that ruthlessly\r\nploughs up and lays waste every hope.\r\n\r\nThis evening was marked by another event. Passing through Ferney in our\r\nway to Geneva, unaccustomed sounds of music arose from the rural church\r\nwhich stood embosomed in trees, surrounded by smokeless, vacant\r\ncottages. The peal of an organ with rich swell awoke the mute air,\r\nlingering along, and mingling with the intense beauty that clothed the\r\nrocks and woods, and waves around. Music\xe2\x80\x94the language of the immortals,\r\ndisclosed to us as testimony of their existence\xe2\x80\x94music, \xe2\x80\x9csilver key of\r\nthe fountain of tears,\xe2\x80\x9d child of love, soother of grief, inspirer of\r\nheroism and radiant thoughts, O music, in this our desolation, we had\r\nforgotten thee! Nor pipe at eve cheered us, nor harmony of voice, nor\r\nlinked thrill of string; thou camest upon us now, like the revealing of\r\nother forms of being; and transported as we had been by the loveliness\r\nof nature, fancying that we beheld the abode of spirits, now we might\r\nwell imagine that we heard their melodious communings. We paused in\r\nsuch awe as would seize on a pale votarist, visiting some holy shrine\r\nat midnight; if she beheld animated and smiling, the image which she\r\nworshipped. We all stood mute; many knelt. In a few minutes however, we\r\nwere recalled to human wonder and sympathy by a familiar strain. The\r\nair was Haydn\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNew-Created World,\xe2\x80\x9d and, old and drooping as humanity\r\nhad become, the world yet fresh as at creation\xe2\x80\x99s day, might still be\r\nworthily celebrated by such an hymn of praise. Adrian and I entered the\r\nchurch; the nave was empty, though the smoke of incense rose from the\r\naltar, bringing with it the recollection of vast congregations, in once\r\nthronged cathedrals; we went into the loft. A blind old man sat at the\r\nbellows; his whole soul was ear; and as he sat in the attitude of\r\nattentive listening, a bright glow of pleasure was diffused over his\r\ncountenance; for, though his lack-lustre eye could not reflect the\r\nbeam, yet his parted lips, and every line of his face and venerable\r\nbrow spoke delight. A young woman sat at the keys, perhaps twenty years\r\nof age. Her auburn hair hung on her neck, and her fair brow shone in\r\nits own beauty; but her drooping eyes let fall fast-flowing tears,\r\nwhile the constraint she exercised to suppress her sobs, and still her\r\ntrembling, flushed her else pale cheek; she was thin; languor, and\r\nalas! sickness, bent her form. We stood looking at the pair, forgetting\r\nwhat we heard in the absorbing sight; till, the last chord struck, the\r\npeal died away in lessening reverberations. The mighty voice, inorganic\r\nwe might call it, for we could in no way associate it with mechanism of\r\npipe or key, stilled its sonorous tone, and the girl, turning to lend\r\nher assistance to her aged companion, at length perceived us.\r\n\r\nIt was her father; and she, since childhood, had been the guide of his\r\ndarkened steps. They were Germans from Saxony, and, emigrating thither\r\nbut a few years before, had formed new ties with the surrounding\r\nvillagers. About the time that the pestilence had broken out, a young\r\nGerman student had joined them. Their simple history was easily\r\ndivined. He, a noble, loved the fair daughter of the poor musician, and\r\nfollowed them in their flight from the persecutions of his friends; but\r\nsoon the mighty leveller came with unblunted scythe to mow, together\r\nwith the grass, the tall flowers of the field. The youth was an early\r\nvictim. She preserved herself for her father\xe2\x80\x99s sake. His blindness\r\npermitted her to continue a delusion, at first the child of\r\naccident\xe2\x80\x94and now solitary beings, sole survivors in the land, he\r\nremained unacquainted with the change, nor was aware that when he\r\nlistened to his child\xe2\x80\x99s music, the mute mountains, senseless lake, and\r\nunconscious trees, were, himself excepted, her sole auditors.\r\n\r\nThe very day that we arrived she had been attacked by symptomatic\r\nillness. She was paralyzed with horror at the idea of leaving her aged,\r\nsightless father alone on the empty earth; but she had not courage to\r\ndisclose the truth, and the very excess of her desperation animated her\r\nto surpassing exertions. At the accustomed vesper hour, she led him to\r\nthe chapel; and, though trembling and weeping on his account, she\r\nplayed, without fault in time, or error in note, the hymn written to\r\ncelebrate the creation of the adorned earth, soon to be her tomb.\r\n\r\nWe came to her like visitors from heaven itself; her high-wrought\r\ncourage; her hardly sustained firmness, fled with the appearance of\r\nrelief. With a shriek she rushed towards us, embraced the knees of\r\nAdrian, and uttering but the words, \xe2\x80\x9cO save my father!\xe2\x80\x9d with sobs and\r\nhysterical cries, opened the long-shut floodgates of her woe.\r\n\r\nPoor girl!\xe2\x80\x94she and her father now lie side by side, beneath the high\r\nwalnut-tree where her lover reposes, and which in her dying moments she\r\nhad pointed out to us. Her father, at length aware of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndanger, unable to see the changes of her dear countenance, obstinately\r\nheld her hand, till it was chilled and stiffened by death. Nor did he\r\nthen move or speak, till, twelve hours after, kindly death took him to\r\nhis breakless repose. They rest beneath the sod, the tree their\r\nmonument;\xe2\x80\x94the hallowed spot is distinct in my memory, paled in by\r\ncraggy Jura, and the far, immeasurable Alps; the spire of the church\r\nthey frequented still points from out the embosoming trees; and though\r\nher hand be cold, still methinks the sounds of divine music which they\r\nloved wander about, solacing their gentle ghosts.\r\n\r\n [24] Burke\xe2\x80\x99s Reflections on the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had now reached Switzerland, so long the final mark and aim of our\r\nexertions. We had looked, I know not wherefore, with hope and pleasing\r\nexpectation on her congregation of hills and snowy crags, and opened\r\nour bosoms with renewed spirits to the icy Biz, which even at Midsummer\r\nused to come from the northern glacier laden with cold. Yet how could\r\nwe nourish expectation of relief? Like our native England, and the vast\r\nextent of fertile France, this mountain-embowered land was desolate of\r\nits inhabitants. Nor bleak mountain-top, nor snow-nourished rivulet;\r\nnot the ice-laden Biz, nor thunder, the tamer of contagion, had\r\npreserved them\xe2\x80\x94 why therefore should we claim exemption?\r\n\r\nWho was there indeed to save? What troop had we brought fit to stand at\r\nbay, and combat with the conqueror? We were a failing remnant, tamed to\r\nmere submission to the coming blow. A train half dead, through fear of\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x94a hopeless, unresisting, almost reckless crew, which, in the\r\ntossed bark of life, had given up all pilotage, and resigned themselves\r\nto the destructive force of ungoverned winds. Like a few furrows of\r\nunreaped corn, which, left standing on a wide field after the rest is\r\ngathered to the garner, are swiftly borne down by the winter storm.\r\nLike a few straggling swallows, which, remaining after their fellows\r\nhad, on the first unkind breath of passing autumn, migrated to genial\r\nclimes, were struck to earth by the first frost of November. Like a\r\nstray sheep that wanders over the sleet-beaten hill-side, while the\r\nflock is in the pen, and dies before morning-dawn. Like a cloud, like\r\none of many that were spread in impenetrable woof over the sky, which,\r\nwhen the shepherd north has driven its companions \xe2\x80\x9cto drink Antipodean\r\nnoon,\xe2\x80\x9d fades and dissolves in the clear ether\xe2\x80\x94Such were we!\r\n\r\nWe left the fair margin of the beauteous lake of Geneva, and entered\r\nthe Alpine ravines; tracing to its source the brawling Arve, through\r\nthe rock-bound valley of Servox, beside the mighty waterfalls, and\r\nunder the shadow of the inaccessible mountains, we travelled on; while\r\nthe luxuriant walnut-tree gave place to the dark pine, whose musical\r\nbranches swung in the wind, and whose upright forms had braved a\r\nthousand storms\xe2\x80\x94till the verdant sod, the flowery dell, and shrubbery\r\nhill were exchanged for the sky-piercing, untrodden, seedless rock,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe bones of the world, waiting to be clothed with every thing\r\nnecessary to give life and beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d[25] Strange that we should seek\r\nshelter here! Surely, if, in those countries where earth was wont, like\r\na tender mother, to nourish her children, we had found her a destroyer,\r\nwe need not seek it here, where stricken by keen penury she seems to\r\nshudder through her stony veins. Nor were we mistaken in our\r\nconjecture. We vainly sought the vast and ever moving glaciers of\r\nChamounix, rifts of pendant ice, seas of congelated waters, the\r\nleafless groves of tempest-battered pines, dells, mere paths for the\r\nloud avalanche, and hill-tops, the resort of thunder-storms. Pestilence\r\nreigned paramount even here. By the time that day and night, like twin\r\nsisters of equal growth, shared equally their dominion over the hours,\r\none by one, beneath the ice-caves, beside the waters springing from the\r\nthawed snows of a thousand winters, another and yet another of the\r\nremnant of the race of Man, closed their eyes for ever to the light.\r\n\r\nYet we were not quite wrong in seeking a scene like this, whereon to\r\nclose the drama. Nature, true to the last, consoled us in the very\r\nheart of misery. Sublime grandeur of outward objects soothed our\r\nhapless hearts, and were in harmony with our desolation. Many sorrows\r\nhave befallen man during his chequered course; and many a woe-stricken\r\nmourner has found himself sole survivor among many. Our misery took its\r\nmajestic shape and colouring from the vast ruin, that accompanied and\r\nmade one with it. Thus on lovely earth, many a dark ravine contains a\r\nbrawling stream, shadowed by romantic rocks, threaded by mossy\r\npaths\xe2\x80\x94but all, except this, wanted the mighty back-ground, the towering\r\nAlps, whose snowy capes, or bared ridges, lifted us from our dull\r\nmortal abode, to the palaces of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s own.\r\n\r\nThis solemn harmony of event and situation regulated our feelings, and\r\ngave as it were fitting costume to our last act. Majestic gloom and\r\ntragic pomp attended the decease of wretched humanity. The funeral\r\nprocession of monarchs of old, was transcended by our splendid shews.\r\nNear the sources of the Arveiron we performed the rites for, four only\r\nexcepted, the last of the species. Adrian and I, leaving Clara and\r\nEvelyn wrapt in peaceful unobserving slumber, carried the body to this\r\ndesolate spot, and placed it in those caves of ice beneath the glacier,\r\nwhich rive and split with the slightest sound, and bring destruction on\r\nthose within the clefts\xe2\x80\x94no bird or beast of prey could here profane the\r\nfrozen form. So, with hushed steps and in silence, we placed the dead\r\non a bier of ice, and then, departing, stood on the rocky platform\r\nbeside the river springs. All hushed as we had been, the very striking\r\nof the air with our persons had sufficed to disturb the repose of this\r\nthawless region; and we had hardly left the cavern, before vast blocks\r\nof ice, detaching themselves from the roof, fell, and covered the human\r\nimage we had deposited within. We had chosen a fair moonlight night,\r\nbut our journey thither had been long, and the crescent sank behind the\r\nwestern heights by the time we had accomplished our purpose. The snowy\r\nmountains and blue glaciers shone in their own light. The rugged and\r\nabrupt ravine, which formed one side of Mont Anvert, was opposite to\r\nus, the glacier at our side; at our feet Arveiron, white and foaming,\r\ndashed over the pointed rocks that jutted into it, and, with whirring\r\nspray and ceaseless roar, disturbed the stilly night. Yellow lightnings\r\nplayed around the vast dome of Mont Blanc, silent as the snow-clad rock\r\nthey illuminated; all was bare, wild, and sublime, while the singing of\r\nthe pines in melodious murmurings added a gentle interest to the rough\r\nmagnificence. Now the riving and fall of icy rocks clave the air; now\r\nthe thunder of the avalanche burst on our ears. In countries whose\r\nfeatures are of less magnitude, nature betrays her living powers in the\r\nfoliage of the trees, in the growth of herbage, in the soft purling of\r\nmeandering streams; here, endowed with giant attributes, the torrent,\r\nthe thunder-storm, and the flow of massive waters, display her\r\nactivity. Such the church-yard, such the requiem, such the eternal\r\ncongregation, that waited on our companion\xe2\x80\x99s funeral!\r\n\r\nNor was it the human form alone which we had placed in this eternal\r\nsepulchre, whose obsequies we now celebrated. With this last victim\r\nPlague vanished from the earth. Death had never wanted weapons\r\nwherewith to destroy life, and we, few and weak as we had become, were\r\nstill exposed to every other shaft with which his full quiver teemed.\r\nBut pestilence was absent from among them. For seven years it had had\r\nfull sway upon earth; she had trod every nook of our spacious globe;\r\nshe had mingled with the atmosphere, which as a cloak enwraps all our\r\nfellow-creatures\xe2\x80\x94the inhabitants of native Europe\xe2\x80\x94the luxurious\r\nAsiatic\xe2\x80\x94the swarthy African and free American had been vanquished and\r\ndestroyed by her. Her barbarous tyranny came to its close here in the\r\nrocky vale of Chamounix.\r\n\r\nStill recurring scenes of misery and pain, the fruits of this\r\ndistemper, made no more a part of our lives\xe2\x80\x94the word plague no longer\r\nrung in our ears\xe2\x80\x94the aspect of plague incarnate in the human\r\ncountenance no longer appeared before our eyes. From this moment I saw\r\nplague no more. She abdicated her throne, and despoiled herself of her\r\nimperial sceptre among the ice rocks that surrounded us. She left\r\nsolitude and silence co-heirs of her kingdom.\r\n\r\nMy present feelings are so mingled with the past, that I cannot say\r\nwhether the knowledge of this change visited us, as we stood on this\r\nsterile spot. It seems to me that it did; that a cloud seemed to pass\r\nfrom over us, that a weight was taken from the air; that henceforth we\r\nbreathed more freely, and raised our heads with some portion of former\r\nliberty. Yet we did not hope. We were impressed by the sentiment, that\r\nour race was run, but that plague would not be our destroyer. The\r\ncoming time was as a mighty river, down which a charmed boat is driven,\r\nwhose mortal steersman knows, that the obvious peril is not the one he\r\nneeds fear, yet that danger is nigh; and who floats awe-struck under\r\nbeetling precipices, through the dark and turbid waters\xe2\x80\x94seeing in the\r\ndistance yet stranger and ruder shapes, towards which he is\r\nirresistibly impelled. What would become of us? O for some Delphic\r\noracle, or Pythian maid, to utter the secrets of futurity! O for some\r\n\xc5\x92dipus to solve the riddle of the cruel Sphynx! Such \xc5\x92dipus was I to\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94not divining a word\xe2\x80\x99s juggle, but whose agonizing pangs, and\r\nsorrow-tainted life were to be the engines, wherewith to lay bare the\r\nsecrets of destiny, and reveal the meaning of the enigma, whose\r\nexplanation closed the history of the human race.\r\n\r\nDim fancies, akin to these, haunted our minds, and instilled feelings\r\nnot unallied to pleasure, as we stood beside this silent tomb of\r\nnature, reared by these lifeless mountains, above her living veins,\r\nchoking her vital principle. \xe2\x80\x9cThus are we left,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo\r\nmelancholy blasted trees, where once a forest waved. We are left to\r\nmourn, and pine, and die. Yet even now we have our duties, which we\r\nmust string ourselves to fulfil: the duty of bestowing pleasure where\r\nwe can, and by force of love, irradiating with rainbow hues the tempest\r\nof grief. Nor will I repine if in this extremity we preserve what we\r\nnow possess. Something tells me, Verney, that we need no longer dread\r\nour cruel enemy, and I cling with delight to the oracular voice. Though\r\nstrange, it will be sweet to mark the growth of your little boy, and\r\nthe development of Clara\xe2\x80\x99s young heart. In the midst of a desert world,\r\nwe are everything to them; and, if we live, it must be our task to make\r\nthis new mode of life happy to them. At present this is easy, for their\r\nchildish ideas do not wander into futurity, and the stinging craving\r\nfor sympathy, and all of love of which our nature is susceptible, is\r\nnot yet awake within them: we cannot guess what will happen then, when\r\nnature asserts her indefeasible and sacred powers; but, long before\r\nthat time, we may all be cold, as he who lies in yonder tomb of ice. We\r\nneed only provide for the present, and endeavour to fill with pleasant\r\nimages the inexperienced fancy of your lovely niece. The scenes which\r\nnow surround us, vast and sublime as they are, are not such as can best\r\ncontribute to this work. Nature is here like our fortunes, grand, but\r\ntoo destructive, bare, and rude, to be able to afford delight to her\r\nyoung imagination. Let us descend to the sunny plains of Italy. Winter\r\nwill soon be here, to clothe this wilderness in double desolation; but\r\nwe will cross the bleak hill-tops, and lead her to scenes of fertility\r\nand beauty, where her path will be adorned with flowers, and the cheery\r\natmosphere inspire pleasure and hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan we quitted Chamounix on the following day. We\r\nhad no cause to hasten our steps; no event was transacted beyond our\r\nactual sphere to enchain our resolves, so we yielded to every idle\r\nwhim, and deemed our time well spent, when we could behold the passage\r\nof the hours without dismay. We loitered along the lovely Vale of\r\nServox; passed long hours on the bridge, which, crossing the ravine of\r\nArve, commands a prospect of its pine-clothed depths, and the snowy\r\nmountains that wall it in. We rambled through romantic Switzerland;\r\ntill, fear of coming winter leading us forward, the first days of\r\nOctober found us in the valley of La Maurienne, which leads to Cenis. I\r\ncannot explain the reluctance we felt at leaving this land of\r\nmountains; perhaps it was, that we regarded the Alps as boundaries\r\nbetween our former and our future state of existence, and so clung\r\nfondly to what of old we had loved. Perhaps, because we had now so few\r\nimpulses urging to a choice between two modes of action, we were\r\npleased to preserve the existence of one, and preferred the prospect of\r\nwhat we were to do, to the recollection of what had been done. We felt\r\nthat for this year danger was past; and we believed that, for some\r\nmonths, we were secured to each other. There was a thrilling, agonizing\r\ndelight in the thought\xe2\x80\x94it filled the eyes with misty tears, it tore the\r\nheart with tumultuous heavings; frailer than the \xe2\x80\x9csnow fall in the\r\nriver,\xe2\x80\x9d were we each and all\xe2\x80\x94but we strove to give life and\r\nindividuality to the meteoric course of our several existences, and to\r\nfeel that no moment escaped us unenjoyed. Thus tottering on the dizzy\r\nbrink, we were happy. Yes! as we sat beneath the toppling rocks, beside\r\nthe waterfalls, near\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Forests, ancient as the hills,\r\nAnd folding sunny spots of greenery,\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere the chamois grazed, and the timid squirrel laid up its\r\nhoard\xe2\x80\x94descanting on the charms of nature, drinking in the while her\r\nunalienable beauties\xe2\x80\x94we were, in an empty world, happy.\r\n\r\nYet, O days of joy\xe2\x80\x94days, when eye spoke to eye, and voices, sweeter\r\nthan the music of the swinging branches of the pines, or rivulet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngentle murmur, answered mine\xe2\x80\x94yet, O days replete with beatitude, days\r\nof loved society\xe2\x80\x94days unutterably dear to me forlorn\xe2\x80\x94pass, O pass\r\nbefore me, making me in your memory forget what I am. Behold, how my\r\nstreaming eyes blot this senseless paper\xe2\x80\x94behold, how my features are\r\nconvulsed by agonizing throes, at your mere recollection, now that,\r\nalone, my tears flow, my lips quiver, my cries fill the air, unseen,\r\nunmarked, unheard! Yet, O yet, days of delight! let me dwell on your\r\nlong-drawn hours!\r\n\r\nAs the cold increased upon us, we passed the Alps, and descended into\r\nItaly. At the uprising of morn, we sat at our repast, and cheated our\r\nregrets by gay sallies or learned disquisitions. The live-long day we\r\nsauntered on, still keeping in view the end of our journey, but\r\ncareless of the hour of its completion. As the evening star shone out,\r\nand the orange sunset, far in the west, marked the position of the dear\r\nland we had for ever left, talk, thought enchaining, made the hours\r\nfly\xe2\x80\x94O that we had lived thus for ever and for ever! Of what consequence\r\nwas it to our four hearts, that they alone were the fountains of life\r\nin the wide world? As far as mere individual sentiment was concerned,\r\nwe had rather be left thus united together, than if, each alone in a\r\npopulous desert of unknown men, we had wandered truly companionless\r\ntill life\xe2\x80\x99s last term. In this manner, we endeavoured to console each\r\nother; in this manner, true philosophy taught us to reason.\r\n\r\nIt was the delight of Adrian and myself to wait on Clara, naming her\r\nthe little queen of the world, ourselves her humblest servitors. When\r\nwe arrived at a town, our first care was to select for her its most\r\nchoice abode; to make sure that no harrowing relic remained of its\r\nformer inhabitants; to seek food for her, and minister to her wants\r\nwith assiduous tenderness. Clara entered into our scheme with childish\r\ngaiety. Her chief business was to attend on Evelyn; but it was her\r\nsport to array herself in splendid robes, adorn herself with sunny\r\ngems, and ape a princely state. Her religion, deep and pure, did not\r\nteach her to refuse to blunt thus the keen sting of regret; her\r\nyouthful vivacity made her enter, heart and soul, into these strange\r\nmasquerades.\r\n\r\nWe had resolved to pass the ensuing winter at Milan, which, as being a\r\nlarge and luxurious city, would afford us choice of homes. We had\r\ndescended the Alps, and left far behind their vast forests and mighty\r\ncrags. We entered smiling Italy. Mingled grass and corn grew in her\r\nplains, the unpruned vines threw their luxuriant branches around the\r\nelms. The grapes, overripe, had fallen on the ground, or hung purple,\r\nor burnished green, among the red and yellow leaves. The ears of\r\nstanding corn winnowed to emptiness by the spendthrift winds; the\r\nfallen foliage of the trees, the weed-grown brooks, the dusky olive,\r\nnow spotted with its blackened fruit; the chestnuts, to which the\r\nsquirrel only was harvest-man; all plenty, and yet, alas! all poverty,\r\npainted in wondrous hues and fantastic groupings this land of beauty.\r\nIn the towns, in the voiceless towns, we visited the churches, adorned\r\nby pictures, master-pieces of art, or galleries of statues\xe2\x80\x94while in\r\nthis genial clime the animals, in new found liberty, rambled through\r\nthe gorgeous palaces, and hardly feared our forgotten aspect. The\r\ndove-coloured oxen turned their full eyes on us, and paced slowly by; a\r\nstartling throng of silly sheep, with pattering feet, would start up in\r\nsome chamber, formerly dedicated to the repose of beauty, and rush,\r\nhuddling past us, down the marble staircase into the street, and again\r\nin at the first open door, taking unrebuked possession of hallowed\r\nsanctuary, or kingly council-chamber. We no longer started at these\r\noccurrences, nor at worse exhibition of change\xe2\x80\x94when the palace had\r\nbecome a mere tomb, pregnant with fetid stench, strewn with the dead;\r\nand we could perceive how pestilence and fear had played strange\r\nantics, chasing the luxurious dame to the dank fields and bare cottage;\r\ngathering, among carpets of Indian woof, and beds of silk, the rough\r\npeasant, or the deformed half-human shape of the wretched beggar.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Milan, and stationed ourselves in the Vice-Roy\xe2\x80\x99s palace.\r\nHere we made laws for ourselves, dividing our day, and fixing distinct\r\noccupations for each hour. In the morning we rode in the adjoining\r\ncountry, or wandered through the palaces, in search of pictures or\r\nantiquities. In the evening we assembled to read or to converse. There\r\nwere few books that we dared read; few, that did not cruelly deface the\r\npainting we bestowed on our solitude, by recalling combinations and\r\nemotions never more to be experienced by us. Metaphysical disquisition;\r\nfiction, which wandering from all reality, lost itself in self-created\r\nerrors; poets of times so far gone by, that to read of them was as to\r\nread of Atlantis and Utopia; or such as referred to nature only, and\r\nthe workings of one particular mind; but most of all, talk, varied and\r\never new, beguiled our hours.\r\n\r\nWhile we paused thus in our onward career towards death, time held on\r\nits accustomed course. Still and for ever did the earth roll on,\r\nenthroned in her atmospheric car, speeded by the force of the invisible\r\ncoursers of never-erring necessity. And now, this dew-drop in the sky,\r\nthis ball, ponderous with mountains, lucent with waves, passing from\r\nthe short tyranny of watery Pisces and the frigid Ram, entered the\r\nradiant demesne of Taurus and the Twins. There, fanned by vernal airs,\r\nthe Spirit of Beauty sprung from her cold repose; and, with winnowing\r\nwings and soft pacing feet, set a girdle of verdure around the earth,\r\nsporting among the violets, hiding within the springing foliage of the\r\ntrees, tripping lightly down the radiant streams into the sunny deep.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor lo! winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear\r\non the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice\r\nof the turtle is heard in our land; the fig tree putteth forth her\r\ngreen figs, and the vines, with the tender grape, give a good\r\nsmell.\xe2\x80\x9d[26] Thus was it in the time of the ancient regal poet; thus was\r\nit now.\r\n\r\nYet how could we miserable hail the approach of this delightful season?\r\nWe hoped indeed that death did not now as heretofore walk in its\r\nshadow; yet, left as we were alone to each other, we looked in each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s faces with enquiring eyes, not daring altogether to trust to\r\nour presentiments, and endeavouring to divine which would be the\r\nhapless survivor to the other three. We were to pass the summer at the\r\nlake of Como, and thither we removed as soon as spring grew to her\r\nmaturity, and the snow disappeared from the hill tops. Ten miles from\r\nComo, under the steep heights of the eastern mountains, by the margin\r\nof the lake, was a villa called the Pliniana, from its being built on\r\nthe site of a fountain, whose periodical ebb and flow is described by\r\nthe younger Pliny in his letters. The house had nearly fallen into\r\nruin, till in the year 2090, an English nobleman had bought it, and\r\nfitted it up with every luxury. Two large halls, hung with splendid\r\ntapestry, and paved with marble, opened on each side of a court, of\r\nwhose two other sides one overlooked the deep dark lake, and the other\r\nwas bounded by a mountain, from whose stony side gushed, with roar and\r\nsplash, the celebrated fountain. Above, underwood of myrtle and tufts\r\nof odorous plants crowned the rock, while the star-pointing giant\r\ncypresses reared themselves in the blue air, and the recesses of the\r\nhills were adorned with the luxuriant growth of chestnut-trees. Here we\r\nfixed our summer residence. We had a lovely skiff, in which we sailed,\r\nnow stemming the midmost waves, now coasting the over-hanging and\r\ncraggy banks, thick sown with evergreens, which dipped their shining\r\nleaves in the waters, and were mirrored in many a little bay and creek\r\nof waters of translucent darkness. Here orange plants bloomed, here\r\nbirds poured forth melodious hymns; and here, during spring, the cold\r\nsnake emerged from the clefts, and basked on the sunny terraces of\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nWere we not happy in this paradisiacal retreat? If some kind spirit had\r\nwhispered forgetfulness to us, methinks we should have been happy here,\r\nwhere the precipitous mountains, nearly pathless, shut from our view\r\nthe far fields of desolate earth, and with small exertion of the\r\nimagination, we might fancy that the cities were still resonant with\r\npopular hum, and the peasant still guided his plough through the\r\nfurrow, and that we, the world\xe2\x80\x99s free denizens, enjoyed a voluntary\r\nexile, and not a remediless cutting off from our extinct species.\r\n\r\nNot one among us enjoyed the beauty of this scenery so much as Clara.\r\nBefore we quitted Milan, a change had taken place in her habits and\r\nmanners. She lost her gaiety, she laid aside her sports, and assumed an\r\nalmost vestal plainness of attire. She shunned us, retiring with Evelyn\r\nto some distant chamber or silent nook; nor did she enter into his\r\npastimes with the same zest as she was wont, but would sit and watch\r\nhim with sadly tender smiles, and eyes bright with tears, yet without a\r\nword of complaint. She approached us timidly, avoided our caresses, nor\r\nshook off her embarrassment till some serious discussion or lofty theme\r\ncalled her for awhile out of herself. Her beauty grew as a rose, which,\r\nopening to the summer wind, discloses leaf after leaf till the sense\r\naches with its excess of loveliness. A slight and variable colour\r\ntinged her cheeks, and her motions seemed attuned by some hidden\r\nharmony of surpassing sweetness. We redoubled our tenderness and\r\nearnest attentions. She received them with grateful smiles, that fled\r\nswift as sunny beam from a glittering wave on an April day.\r\n\r\nOur only acknowledged point of sympathy with her, appeared to be\r\nEvelyn. This dear little fellow was a comforter and delight to us\r\nbeyond all words. His buoyant spirit, and his innocent ignorance of our\r\nvast calamity, were balm to us, whose thoughts and feelings were\r\nover-wrought and spun out in the immensity of speculative sorrow. To\r\ncherish, to caress, to amuse him was the common task of all. Clara, who\r\nfelt towards him in some degree like a young mother, gratefully\r\nacknowledged our kindness towards him. To me, O! to me, who saw the\r\nclear brows and soft eyes of the beloved of my heart, my lost and ever\r\ndear Idris, re-born in his gentle face, to me he was dear even to pain;\r\nif I pressed him to my heart, methought I clasped a real and living\r\npart of her, who had lain there through long years of youthful\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of Adrian and myself to go out each day in our skiff\r\nto forage in the adjacent country. In these expeditions we were seldom\r\naccompanied by Clara or her little charge, but our return was an hour\r\nof hilarity. Evelyn ransacked our stores with childish eagerness, and\r\nwe always brought some new found gift for our fair companion. Then too\r\nwe made discoveries of lovely scenes or gay palaces, whither in the\r\nevening we all proceeded. Our sailing expeditions were most divine, and\r\nwith a fair wind or transverse course we cut the liquid waves; and, if\r\ntalk failed under the pressure of thought, I had my clarionet with me,\r\nwhich awoke the echoes, and gave the change to our careful minds. Clara\r\nat such times often returned to her former habits of free converse and\r\ngay sally; and though our four hearts alone beat in the world, those\r\nfour hearts were happy.\r\n\r\nOne day, on our return from the town of Como, with a laden boat, we\r\nexpected as usual to be met at the port by Clara and Evelyn, and we\r\nwere somewhat surprised to see the beach vacant. I, as my nature\r\nprompted, would not prognosticate evil, but explained it away as a mere\r\ncasual incident. Not so Adrian. He was seized with sudden trembling and\r\napprehension, and he called to me with vehemence to steer quickly for\r\nland, and, when near, leapt from the boat, half falling into the water;\r\nand, scrambling up the steep bank, hastened along the narrow strip of\r\ngarden, the only level space between the lake and the mountain. I\r\nfollowed without delay; the garden and inner court were empty, so was\r\nthe house, whose every room we visited. Adrian called loudly upon\r\nClara\xe2\x80\x99s name, and was about to rush up the near mountain-path, when the\r\ndoor of a summer-house at the end of the garden slowly opened, and\r\nClara appeared, not advancing towards us, but leaning against a column\r\nof the building with blanched cheeks, in a posture of utter\r\ndespondency. Adrian sprang towards her with a cry of joy, and folded\r\nher delightedly in his arms. She withdrew from his embrace, and,\r\nwithout a word, again entered the summer-house. Her quivering lips, her\r\ndespairing heart refused to afford her voice to express our misfortune.\r\nPoor little Evelyn had, while playing with her, been seized with sudden\r\nfever, and now lay torpid and speechless on a little couch in the\r\nsummer-house.\r\n\r\nFor a whole fortnight we unceasingly watched beside the poor child, as\r\nhis life declined under the ravages of a virulent typhus. His little\r\nform and tiny lineaments encaged the embryo of the world-spanning mind\r\nof man. Man\xe2\x80\x99s nature, brimful of passions and affections, would have\r\nhad an home in that little heart, whose swift pulsations hurried\r\ntowards their close. His small hand\xe2\x80\x99s fine mechanism, now flaccid and\r\nunbent, would in the growth of sinew and muscle, have achieved works of\r\nbeauty or of strength. His tender rosy feet would have trod in firm\r\nmanhood the bowers and glades of earth\xe2\x80\x94 these reflections were now of\r\nlittle use: he lay, thought and strength suspended, waiting unresisting\r\nthe final blow.\r\n\r\nWe watched at his bedside, and when the access of fever was on him, we\r\nneither spoke nor looked at each other, marking only his obstructed\r\nbreath and the mortal glow that tinged his sunken cheek, the heavy\r\ndeath that weighed on his eyelids. It is a trite evasion to say, that\r\nwords could not express our long drawn agony; yet how can words image\r\nsensations, whose tormenting keenness throw us back, as it were, on the\r\ndeep roots and hidden foundations of our nature, which shake our being\r\nwith earth-quake-throe, so that we leave to confide in accustomed\r\nfeelings which like mother-earth support us, and cling to some vain\r\nimagination or deceitful hope, which will soon be buried in the ruins\r\noccasioned by the final shock. I have called that period a fortnight,\r\nwhich we passed watching the changes of the sweet child\xe2\x80\x99s malady\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsuch it might have been\xe2\x80\x94at night, we wondered to find another day gone,\r\nwhile each particular hour seemed endless. Day and night were exchanged\r\nfor one another uncounted; we slept hardly at all, nor did we even quit\r\nhis room, except when a pang of grief seized us, and we retired from\r\neach other for a short period to conceal our sobs and tears. We\r\nendeavoured in vain to abstract Clara from this deplorable scene. She\r\nsat, hour after hour, looking at him, now softly arranging his pillow,\r\nand, while he had power to swallow, administered his drink. At length\r\nthe moment of his death came: the blood paused in its flow \xe2\x80\x94his eyes\r\nopened, and then closed again: without convulsion or sigh, the frail\r\ntenement was left vacant of its spiritual inhabitant.\r\n\r\nI have heard that the sight of the dead has confirmed materialists in\r\ntheir belief. I ever felt otherwise. Was that my child\xe2\x80\x94that moveless\r\ndecaying inanimation? My child was enraptured by my caresses; his dear\r\nvoice cloathed with meaning articulations his thoughts, otherwise\r\ninaccessible; his smile was a ray of the soul, and the same soul sat\r\nupon its throne in his eyes. I turn from this mockery of what he was.\r\nTake, O earth, thy debt! freely and for ever I consign to thee the garb\r\nthou didst afford. But thou, sweet child, amiable and beloved boy,\r\neither thy spirit has sought a fitter dwelling, or, shrined in my\r\nheart, thou livest while it lives.\r\n\r\nWe placed his remains under a cypress, the upright mountain being\r\nscooped out to receive them. And then Clara said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish me to\r\nlive, take me from hence. There is something in this scene of\r\ntranscendent beauty, in these trees, and hills and waves, that for ever\r\nwhisper to me, leave thy cumbrous flesh, and make a part of us. I\r\nearnestly entreat you to take me away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo on the fifteenth of August we bade adieu to our villa, and the\r\nembowering shades of this abode of beauty; to calm bay and noisy\r\nwaterfall; to Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s little grave we bade farewell! and then, with\r\nheavy hearts, we departed on our pilgrimage towards Rome.\r\n\r\n [25] Mary Wollstonecraft\xe2\x80\x99s Letters from Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n [26] Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s Song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow\xe2\x80\x94soft awhile\xe2\x80\x94have I arrived so near the end? Yes! it is all over\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94a step or two over those new made graves, and the wearisome way is\r\ndone. Can I accomplish my task? Can I streak my paper with words\r\ncapacious of the grand conclusion? Arise, black Melancholy! quit thy\r\nCimmerian solitude! Bring with thee murky fogs from hell, which may\r\ndrink up the day; bring blight and pestiferous exhalations, which,\r\nentering the hollow caverns and breathing places of earth, may fill her\r\nstony veins with corruption, so that not only herbage may no longer\r\nflourish, the trees may rot, and the rivers run with gall\xe2\x80\x94but the\r\neverlasting mountains be decomposed, and the mighty deep putrify, and\r\nthe genial atmosphere which clips the globe, lose all powers of\r\ngeneration and sustenance. Do this, sad visaged power, while I write,\r\nwhile eyes read these pages.\r\n\r\nAnd who will read them? Beware, tender offspring of the re-born world\xe2\x80\x94\r\nbeware, fair being, with human heart, yet untamed by care, and human\r\nbrow, yet unploughed by time\xe2\x80\x94beware, lest the cheerful current of thy\r\nblood be checked, thy golden locks turn grey, thy sweet dimpling smiles\r\nbe changed to fixed, harsh wrinkles! Let not day look on these lines,\r\nlest garish day waste, turn pale, and die. Seek a cypress grove, whose\r\nmoaning boughs will be harmony befitting; seek some cave, deep\r\nembowered in earth\xe2\x80\x99s dark entrails, where no light will penetrate, save\r\nthat which struggles, red and flickering, through a single fissure,\r\nstaining thy page with grimmest livery of death.\r\n\r\nThere is a painful confusion in my brain, which refuses to delineate\r\ndistinctly succeeding events. Sometimes the irradiation of my friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngentle smile comes before me; and methinks its light spans and fills\r\neternity\xe2\x80\x94then, again, I feel the gasping throes\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWe quitted Como, and in compliance with Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s earnest desire, we\r\ntook Venice in our way to Rome. There was something to the English\r\npeculiarly attractive in the idea of this wave-encircled,\r\nisland-enthroned city. Adrian had never seen it. We went down the Po\r\nand the Brenta in a boat; and, the days proving intolerably hot, we\r\nrested in the bordering palaces during the day, travelling through the\r\nnight, when darkness made the bordering banks indistinct, and our\r\nsolitude less remarkable; when the wandering moon lit the waves that\r\ndivided before our prow, and the night-wind filled our sails, and the\r\nmurmuring stream, waving trees, and swelling canvass, accorded in\r\nharmonious strain. Clara, long overcome by excessive grief, had to a\r\ngreat degree cast aside her timid, cold reserve, and received our\r\nattentions with grateful tenderness. While Adrian with poetic fervour\r\ndiscoursed of the glorious nations of the dead, of the beauteous earth\r\nand the fate of man, she crept near him, drinking in his speech with\r\nsilent pleasure. We banished from our talk, and as much as possible\r\nfrom our thoughts, the knowledge of our desolation. And it would be\r\nincredible to an inhabitant of cities, to one among a busy throng, to\r\nwhat extent we succeeded. It was as a man confined in a dungeon, whose\r\nsmall and grated rift at first renders the doubtful light more sensibly\r\nobscure, till, the visual orb having drunk in the beam, and adapted\r\nitself to its scantiness, he finds that clear noon inhabits his cell.\r\nSo we, a simple triad on empty earth, were multiplied to each other,\r\ntill we became all in all. We stood like trees, whose roots are\r\nloosened by the wind, which support one another, leaning and clinging\r\nwith encreased fervour while the wintry storms howl. Thus we floated\r\ndown the widening stream of the Po, sleeping when the cicale sang,\r\nawake with the stars. We entered the narrower banks of the Brenta, and\r\narrived at the shore of the Laguna at sunrise on the sixth of\r\nSeptember. The bright orb slowly rose from behind its cupolas and\r\ntowers, and shed its penetrating light upon the glassy waters. Wrecks\r\nof gondolas, and some few uninjured ones, were strewed on the beach at\r\nFusina. We embarked in one of these for the widowed daughter of ocean,\r\nwho, abandoned and fallen, sat forlorn on her propping isles, looking\r\ntowards the far mountains of Greece. We rowed lightly over the Laguna,\r\nand entered Canale Grande. The tide ebbed sullenly from out the broken\r\nportals and violated halls of Venice: sea weed and sea monsters were\r\nleft on the blackened marble, while the salt ooze defaced the matchless\r\nworks of art that adorned their walls, and the sea gull flew out from\r\nthe shattered window. In the midst of this appalling ruin of the\r\nmonuments of man\xe2\x80\x99s power, nature asserted her ascendancy, and shone\r\nmore beauteous from the contrast. The radiant waters hardly trembled,\r\nwhile the rippling waves made many sided mirrors to the sun; the blue\r\nimmensity, seen beyond Lido, stretched far, unspecked by boat, so\r\ntranquil, so lovely, that it seemed to invite us to quit the land\r\nstrewn with ruins, and to seek refuge from sorrow and fear on its\r\nplacid extent.\r\n\r\nWe saw the ruins of this hapless city from the height of the tower of\r\nSan Marco, immediately under us, and turned with sickening hearts to\r\nthe sea, which, though it be a grave, rears no monument, discloses no\r\nruin. Evening had come apace. The sun set in calm majesty behind the\r\nmisty summits of the Apennines, and its golden and roseate hues painted\r\nthe mountains of the opposite shore. \xe2\x80\x9cThat land,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adrian, \xe2\x80\x9ctinged\r\nwith the last glories of the day, is Greece.\xe2\x80\x9d Greece! The sound had a\r\nresponsive chord in the bosom of Clara. She vehemently reminded us that\r\nwe had promised to take her once again to Greece, to the tomb of her\r\nparents. Why go to Rome? what should we do at Rome? We might take one\r\nof the many vessels to be found here, embark in it, and steer right for\r\nAlbania.\r\n\r\nI objected the dangers of ocean, and the distance of the mountains we\r\nsaw, from Athens; a distance which, from the savage uncultivation of\r\nthe country, was almost impassable. Adrian, who was delighted with\r\nClara\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, obviated these objections. The season was favourable;\r\nthe north-west that blew would take us transversely across the gulph;\r\nand then we might find, in some abandoned port, a light Greek caique,\r\nadapted for such navigation, and run down the coast of the Morea, and,\r\npassing over the Isthmus of Corinth, without much land-travelling or\r\nfatigue, find ourselves at Athens. This appeared to me wild talk; but\r\nthe sea, glowing with a thousand purple hues, looked so brilliant and\r\nsafe; my beloved companions were so earnest, so determined, that, when\r\nAdrian said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, though it is not exactly what you wish, yet\r\nconsent, to please me\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I could no longer refuse. That evening we\r\nselected a vessel, whose size just seemed fitted for our enterprize; we\r\nbent the sails and put the rigging in order, and reposing that night in\r\none of the city\xe2\x80\x99s thousand palaces, agreed to embark at sunrise the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nWhen winds that move not its calm surface, sweep\r\nThe azure sea, I love the land no more;\r\nThe smiles of the serene and tranquil deep\r\nTempt my unquiet mind\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nThus said Adrian, quoting a translation of Moschus\xe2\x80\x99s poem, as in the\r\nclear morning light, we rowed over the Laguna, past Lido, into the open\r\nsea\xe2\x80\x94I would have added in continuation,\r\n\r\n        But when the roar\r\nOf ocean\xe2\x80\x99s gray abyss resounds, and foam\r\nGathers upon the sea, and vast waves burst\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nBut my friends declared that such verses were evil augury; so in\r\ncheerful mood we left the shallow waters, and, when out at sea,\r\nunfurled our sails to catch the favourable breeze. The laughing morning\r\nair filled them, while sun-light bathed earth, sky and ocean\xe2\x80\x94the placid\r\nwaves divided to receive our keel, and playfully kissed the dark sides\r\nof our little skiff, murmuring a welcome; as land receded, still the\r\nblue expanse, most waveless, twin sister to the azure empyrean,\r\nafforded smooth conduct to our bark. As the air and waters were\r\ntranquil and balmy, so were our minds steeped in quiet. In comparison\r\nwith the unstained deep, funereal earth appeared a grave, its high\r\nrocks and stately mountains were but monuments, its trees the plumes of\r\na herse, the brooks and rivers brackish with tears for departed man.\r\nFarewell to desolate towns \xe2\x80\x94to fields with their savage intermixture of\r\ncorn and weeds\xe2\x80\x94to ever multiplying relics of our lost species. Ocean,\r\nwe commit ourselves to thee \xe2\x80\x94even as the patriarch of old floated above\r\nthe drowned world, let us be saved, as thus we betake ourselves to thy\r\nperennial flood.\r\n\r\nAdrian sat at the helm; I attended to the rigging, the breeze right aft\r\nfilled our swelling canvas, and we ran before it over the untroubled\r\ndeep. The wind died away at noon; its idle breath just permitted us to\r\nhold our course. As lazy, fair-weather sailors, careless of the coming\r\nhour, we talked gaily of our coasting voyage, of our arrival at Athens.\r\nWe would make our home of one of the Cyclades, and there in\r\nmyrtle-groves, amidst perpetual spring, fanned by the wholesome\r\nsea-breezes\xe2\x80\x94we would live long years in beatific union\xe2\x80\x94Was there such a\r\nthing as death in the world?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe sun passed its zenith, and lingered down the stainless floor of\r\nheaven. Lying in the boat, my face turned up to the sky, I thought I\r\nsaw on its blue white, marbled streaks, so slight, so immaterial, that\r\nnow I said\xe2\x80\x94 They are there\xe2\x80\x94and now, It is a mere imagination. A sudden\r\nfear stung me while I gazed; and, starting up, and running to the\r\nprow,\xe2\x80\x94as I stood, my hair was gently lifted on my brow\xe2\x80\x94a dark line of\r\nripples appeared to the east, gaining rapidly on us\xe2\x80\x94my breathless\r\nremark to Adrian, was followed by the flapping of the canvas, as the\r\nadverse wind struck it, and our boat lurched\xe2\x80\x94swift as speech, the web\r\nof the storm thickened over head, the sun went down red, the dark sea\r\nwas strewed with foam, and our skiff rose and fell in its encreasing\r\nfurrows.\r\n\r\nBehold us now in our frail tenement, hemmed in by hungry, roaring\r\nwaves, buffeted by winds. In the inky east two vast clouds, sailing\r\ncontrary ways, met; the lightning leapt forth, and the hoarse thunder\r\nmuttered. Again in the south, the clouds replied, and the forked stream\r\nof fire running along the black sky, shewed us the appalling piles of\r\nclouds, now met and obliterated by the heaving waves. Great God! And we\r\nalone\xe2\x80\x94we three\xe2\x80\x94 alone\xe2\x80\x94alone\xe2\x80\x94sole dwellers on the sea and on the earth,\r\nwe three must perish! The vast universe, its myriad worlds, and the\r\nplains of boundless earth which we had left\xe2\x80\x94the extent of shoreless sea\r\naround\xe2\x80\x94contracted to my view\xe2\x80\x94they and all that they contained, shrunk\r\nup to one point, even to our tossing bark, freighted with glorious\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nA convulsion of despair crossed the love-beaming face of Adrian, while\r\nwith set teeth he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cYet they shall be saved!\xe2\x80\x9d Clara, visited\r\nby an human pang, pale and trembling, crept near him\xe2\x80\x94he looked on her\r\nwith an encouraging smile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo you fear, sweet girl? O, do not fear, we\r\nshall soon be on shore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe darkness prevented me from seeing the changes of her countenance;\r\nbut her voice was clear and sweet, as she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I fear?\r\nneither sea nor storm can harm us, if mighty destiny or the ruler of\r\ndestiny does not permit. And then the stinging fear of surviving either\r\nof you, is not here\xe2\x80\x94one death will clasp us undivided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we took in all our sails, save a gib; and, as soon as we\r\nmight without danger, changed our course, running with the wind for the\r\nItalian shore. Dark night mixed everything; we hardly discerned the\r\nwhite crests of the murderous surges, except when lightning made brief\r\nnoon, and drank the darkness, shewing us our danger, and restoring us\r\nto double night. We were all silent, except when Adrian, as steersman,\r\nmade an encouraging observation. Our little shell obeyed the rudder\r\nmiraculously well, and ran along on the top of the waves, as if she had\r\nbeen an offspring of the sea, and the angry mother sheltered her\r\nendangered child.\r\n\r\nI sat at the prow, watching our course; when suddenly I heard the\r\nwaters break with redoubled fury. We were certainly near the shore\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthe same time I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cAbout there!\xe2\x80\x9d and a broad lightning filling the\r\nconcave, shewed us for one moment the level beach a-head, disclosing\r\neven the sands, and stunted, ooze-sprinkled beds of reeds, that grew at\r\nhigh water mark. Again it was dark, and we drew in our breath with such\r\ncontent as one may, who, while fragments of volcano-hurled rock darken\r\nthe air, sees a vast mass ploughing the ground immediately at his feet.\r\nWhat to do we knew not \xe2\x80\x94the breakers here, there, everywhere,\r\nencompassed us\xe2\x80\x94they roared, and dashed, and flung their hated spray in\r\nour faces. With considerable difficulty and danger we succeeded at\r\nlength in altering our course, and stretched out from shore. I urged my\r\ncompanions to prepare for the wreck of our little skiff, and to bind\r\nthemselves to some oar or spar which might suffice to float them. I was\r\nmyself an excellent swimmer\xe2\x80\x94the very sight of the sea was wont to raise\r\nin me such sensations, as a huntsman experiences, when he hears a pack\r\nof hounds in full cry; I loved to feel the waves wrap me and strive to\r\noverpower me; while I, lord of myself, moved this way or that, in spite\r\nof their angry buffetings. Adrian also could swim\xe2\x80\x94but the weakness of\r\nhis frame prevented him from feeling pleasure in the exercise, or\r\nacquiring any great expertness. But what power could the strongest\r\nswimmer oppose to the overpowering violence of ocean in its fury? My\r\nefforts to prepare my companions were rendered nearly futile \xe2\x80\x94for the\r\nroaring breakers prevented our hearing one another speak, and the\r\nwaves, that broke continually over our boat, obliged me to exert all my\r\nstrength in lading the water out, as fast as it came in. The while\r\ndarkness, palpable and rayless, hemmed us round, dissipated only by the\r\nlightning; sometimes we beheld thunderbolts, fiery red, fall into the\r\nsea, and at intervals vast spouts stooped from the clouds, churning the\r\nwild ocean, which rose to meet them; while the fierce gale bore the\r\nrack onwards, and they were lost in the chaotic mingling of sky and\r\nsea. Our gunwales had been torn away, our single sail had been rent to\r\nribbands, and borne down the stream of the wind. We had cut away our\r\nmast, and lightened the boat of all she contained\xe2\x80\x94Clara attempted to\r\nassist me in heaving the water from the hold, and, as she turned her\r\neyes to look on the lightning, I could discern by that momentary gleam,\r\nthat resignation had conquered every fear. We have a power given us in\r\nany worst extremity, which props the else feeble mind of man, and\r\nenables us to endure the most savage tortures with a stillness of soul\r\nwhich in hours of happiness we could not have imagined. A calm, more\r\ndreadful in truth than the tempest, allayed the wild beatings of my\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94a calm like that of the gamester, the suicide, and the murderer,\r\nwhen the last die is on the point of being cast\xe2\x80\x94while the poisoned cup\r\nis at the lips,\xe2\x80\x94as the death-blow is about to be given.\r\n\r\nHours passed thus\xe2\x80\x94hours which might write old age on the face of\r\nbeardless youth, and grizzle the silky hair of infancy\xe2\x80\x94-hours, while\r\nthe chaotic uproar continued, while each dread gust transcended in fury\r\nthe one before, and our skiff hung on the breaking wave, and then\r\nrushed into the valley below, and trembled and spun between the watery\r\nprecipices that seemed most to meet above her. For a moment the gale\r\npaused, and ocean sank to comparative silence\xe2\x80\x94it was a breathless\r\ninterval; the wind which, as a practised leaper, had gathered itself up\r\nbefore it sprung, now with terrific roar rushed over the sea, and the\r\nwaves struck our stern. Adrian exclaimed that the rudder was gone;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nare lost,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clara, \xe2\x80\x9cSave yourselves\xe2\x80\x94O save yourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nlightning shewed me the poor girl half buried in the water at the\r\nbottom of the boat; as she was sinking in it Adrian caught her up, and\r\nsustained her in his arms. We were without a rudder\xe2\x80\x94we rushed prow\r\nforemost into the vast billows piled up a-head\xe2\x80\x94 they broke over and\r\nfilled the tiny skiff; one scream I heard\xe2\x80\x94one cry that we were gone, I\r\nuttered; I found myself in the waters; darkness was around. When the\r\nlight of the tempest flashed, I saw the keel of our upset boat close to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94I clung to this, grasping it with clenched hand and nails, while I\r\nendeavoured during each flash to discover any appearance of my\r\ncompanions. I thought I saw Adrian at no great distance from me,\r\nclinging to an oar; I sprung from my hold, and with energy beyond my\r\nhuman strength, I dashed aside the waters as I strove to lay hold of\r\nhim. As that hope failed, instinctive love of life animated me, and\r\nfeelings of contention, as if a hostile will combated with mine. I\r\nbreasted the surges, and flung them from me, as I would the opposing\r\nfront and sharpened claws of a lion about to enfang my bosom. When I\r\nhad been beaten down by one wave, I rose on another, while I felt\r\nbitter pride curl my lip.\r\n\r\nEver since the storm had carried us near the shore, we had never\r\nattained any great distance from it. With every flash I saw the\r\nbordering coast; yet the progress I made was small, while each wave, as\r\nit receded, carried me back into ocean\xe2\x80\x99s far abysses. At one moment I\r\nfelt my foot touch the sand, and then again I was in deep water; my\r\narms began to lose their power of motion; my breath failed me under the\r\ninfluence of the strangling waters\xe2\x80\x94 a thousand wild and delirious\r\nthoughts crossed me: as well as I can now recall them, my chief feeling\r\nwas, how sweet it would be to lay my head on the quiet earth, where the\r\nsurges would no longer strike my weakened frame, nor the sound of\r\nwaters ring in my ears\xe2\x80\x94to attain this repose, not to save my life, I\r\nmade a last effort\xe2\x80\x94the shelving shore suddenly presented a footing for\r\nme. I rose, and was again thrown down by the breakers\xe2\x80\x94a point of rock\r\nto which I was enabled to cling, gave me a moment\xe2\x80\x99s respite; and then,\r\ntaking advantage of the ebbing of the waves, I ran forwards\xe2\x80\x94 gained the\r\ndry sands, and fell senseless on the oozy reeds that sprinkled them.\r\n\r\nI must have lain long deprived of life; for when first, with a\r\nsickening feeling, I unclosed my eyes, the light of morning met them.\r\nGreat change had taken place meanwhile: grey dawn dappled the flying\r\nclouds, which sped onwards, leaving visible at intervals vast lakes of\r\npure ether. A fountain of light arose in an encreasing stream from the\r\neast, behind the waves of the Adriatic, changing the grey to a roseate\r\nhue, and then flooding sky and sea with aerial gold.\r\n\r\nA kind of stupor followed my fainting; my senses were alive, but memory\r\nwas extinct. The blessed respite was short\xe2\x80\x94a snake lurked near me to\r\nsting me into life\xe2\x80\x94on the first retrospective emotion I would have\r\nstarted up, but my limbs refused to obey me; my knees trembled, the\r\nmuscles had lost all power. I still believed that I might find one of\r\nmy beloved companions cast like me, half alive, on the beach; and I\r\nstrove in every way to restore my frame to the use of its animal\r\nfunctions. I wrung the brine from my hair; and the rays of the risen\r\nsun soon visited me with genial warmth. With the restoration of my\r\nbodily powers, my mind became in some degree aware of the universe of\r\nmisery, henceforth to be its dwelling. I ran to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge,\r\ncalling on the beloved names. Ocean drank in, and absorbed my feeble\r\nvoice, replying with pitiless roar. I climbed a near tree: the level\r\nsands bounded by a pine forest, and the sea clipped round by the\r\nhorizon, was all that I could discern. In vain I extended my researches\r\nalong the beach; the mast we had thrown overboard, with tangled\r\ncordage, and remnants of a sail, was the sole relic land received of\r\nour wreck. Sometimes I stood still, and wrung my hands. I accused earth\r\nand sky \xe2\x80\x94the universal machine and the Almighty power that misdirected\r\nit. Again I threw myself on the sands, and then the sighing wind,\r\nmimicking a human cry, roused me to bitter, fallacious hope. Assuredly\r\nif any little bark or smallest canoe had been near, I should have\r\nsought the savage plains of ocean, found the dear remains of my lost\r\nones, and clinging round them, have shared their grave.\r\n\r\nThe day passed thus; each moment contained eternity; although when hour\r\nafter hour had gone by, I wondered at the quick flight of time. Yet\r\neven now I had not drunk the bitter potion to the dregs; I was not yet\r\npersuaded of my loss; I did not yet feel in every pulsation, in every\r\nnerve, in every thought, that I remained alone of my race,\xe2\x80\x94that I was\r\nthe LAST MAN.\r\n\r\nThe day had clouded over, and a drizzling rain set in at sunset. Even\r\nthe eternal skies weep, I thought; is there any shame then, that mortal\r\nman should spend himself in tears? I remembered the ancient fables, in\r\nwhich human beings are described as dissolving away through weeping\r\ninto ever-gushing fountains. Ah! that so it were; and then my destiny\r\nwould be in some sort akin to the watery death of Adrian and Clara. Oh!\r\ngrief is fantastic; it weaves a web on which to trace the history of\r\nits woe from every form and change around; it incorporates itself with\r\nall living nature; it finds sustenance in every object; as light, it\r\nfills all things, and, like light, it gives its own colours to all.\r\n\r\nI had wandered in my search to some distance from the spot on which I\r\nhad been cast, and came to one of those watch-towers, which at stated\r\ndistances line the Italian shore. I was glad of shelter, glad to find a\r\nwork of human hands, after I had gazed so long on nature\xe2\x80\x99s drear\r\nbarrenness; so I entered, and ascended the rough winding staircase into\r\nthe guard-room. So far was fate kind, that no harrowing vestige\r\nremained of its former inhabitants; a few planks laid across two iron\r\ntressels, and strewed with the dried leaves of Indian corn, was the bed\r\npresented to me; and an open chest, containing some half mouldered\r\nbiscuit, awakened an appetite, which perhaps existed before, but of\r\nwhich, until now, I was not aware. Thirst also, violent and parching,\r\nthe result of the sea-water I had drank, and of the exhaustion of my\r\nframe, tormented me. Kind nature had gifted the supply of these wants\r\nwith pleasurable sensations, so that I\xe2\x80\x94even I!\xe2\x80\x94was refreshed and\r\ncalmed, as I ate of this sorry fare, and drank a little of the sour\r\nwine which half filled a flask left in this abandoned dwelling. Then I\r\nstretched myself on the bed, not to be disdained by the victim of\r\nshipwreck. The earthy smell of the dried leaves was balm to my sense\r\nafter the hateful odour of sea-weed. I forgot my state of loneliness. I\r\nneither looked backward nor forward; my senses were hushed to repose; I\r\nfell asleep and dreamed of all dear inland scenes, of hay-makers, of\r\nthe shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s whistle to his dog, when he demanded his help to drive\r\nthe flock to fold; of sights and sounds peculiar to my boyhood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmountain life, which I had long forgotten.\r\n\r\nI awoke in a painful agony\xe2\x80\x94for I fancied that ocean, breaking its\r\nbounds, carried away the fixed continent and deep rooted mountains,\r\ntogether with the streams I loved, the woods, and the flocks\xe2\x80\x94it raged\r\naround, with that continued and dreadful roar which had accompanied the\r\nlast wreck of surviving humanity. As my waking sense returned, the bare\r\nwalls of the guard room closed round me, and the rain pattered against\r\nthe single window. How dreadful it is, to emerge from the oblivion of\r\nslumber, and to receive as a good morrow the mute wailing of one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nhapless heart \xe2\x80\x94to return from the land of deceptive dreams, to the\r\nheavy knowledge of unchanged disaster!\xe2\x80\x94Thus was it with me, now, and\r\nfor ever! The sting of other griefs might be blunted by time; and even\r\nmine yielded sometimes during the day, to the pleasure inspired by the\r\nimagination or the senses; but I never look first upon the\r\nmorning-light but with my fingers pressed tight on my bursting heart,\r\nand my soul deluged with the interminable flood of hopeless misery. Now\r\nI awoke for the first time in the dead world\xe2\x80\x94I awoke alone\xe2\x80\x94and the dull\r\ndirge of the sea, heard even amidst the rain, recalled me to the\r\nreflection of the wretch I had become. The sound came like a reproach,\r\na scoff\xe2\x80\x94like the sting of remorse in the soul\xe2\x80\x94I gasped\xe2\x80\x94the veins and\r\nmuscles of my throat swelled, suffocating me. I put my fingers to my\r\nears, I buried my head in the leaves of my couch, I would have dived to\r\nthe centre to lose hearing of that hideous moan.\r\n\r\nBut another task must be mine\xe2\x80\x94again I visited the detested beach\xe2\x80\x94 again\r\nI vainly looked far and wide\xe2\x80\x94again I raised my unanswered cry, lifting\r\nup the only voice that could ever again force the mute air to syllable\r\nthe human thought.\r\n\r\nWhat a pitiable, forlorn, disconsolate being I was! My very aspect and\r\ngarb told the tale of my despair. My hair was matted and wild\xe2\x80\x94my limbs\r\nsoiled with salt ooze; while at sea, I had thrown off those of my\r\ngarments that encumbered me, and the rain drenched the thin\r\nsummer-clothing I had retained\xe2\x80\x94my feet were bare, and the stunted reeds\r\nand broken shells made them bleed\xe2\x80\x94the while, I hurried to and fro, now\r\nlooking earnestly on some distant rock which, islanded in the sands,\r\nbore for a moment a deceptive appearance\xe2\x80\x94now with flashing eyes\r\nreproaching the murderous ocean for its unutterable cruelty.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I compared myself to that monarch of the waste\xe2\x80\x94Robinson\r\nCrusoe. We had been both thrown companionless\xe2\x80\x94he on the shore of a\r\ndesolate island: I on that of a desolate world. I was rich in the so\r\ncalled goods of life. If I turned my steps from the near barren scene,\r\nand entered any of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s million cities, I should find their\r\nwealth stored up for my accommodation\xe2\x80\x94clothes, food, books, and a\r\nchoice of dwelling beyond the command of the princes of former\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94every climate was subject to my selection, while he was obliged\r\nto toil in the acquirement of every necessary, and was the inhabitant\r\nof a tropical island, against whose heats and storms he could obtain\r\nsmall shelter.\xe2\x80\x94Viewing the question thus, who would not have preferred\r\nthe Sybarite enjoyments I could command, the philosophic leisure, and\r\nample intellectual resources, to his life of labour and peril? Yet he\r\nwas far happier than I: for he could hope, nor hope in vain\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndestined vessel at last arrived, to bear him to countrymen and kindred,\r\nwhere the events of his solitude became a fire-side tale. To none could\r\nI ever relate the story of my adversity; no hope had I. He knew that,\r\nbeyond the ocean which begirt his lonely island, thousands lived whom\r\nthe sun enlightened when it shone also on him: beneath the meridian sun\r\nand visiting moon, I alone bore human features; I alone could give\r\narticulation to thought; and, when I slept, both day and night were\r\nunbeheld of any. He had fled from his fellows, and was transported with\r\nterror at the print of a human foot. I would have knelt down and\r\nworshipped the same. The wild and cruel Caribbee, the merciless\r\nCannibal\xe2\x80\x94or worse than these, the uncouth, brute, and remorseless\r\nveteran in the vices of civilization, would have been to me a beloved\r\ncompanion, a treasure dearly prized\xe2\x80\x94his nature would be kin to mine;\r\nhis form cast in the same mould; human blood would flow in his veins; a\r\nhuman sympathy must link us for ever. It cannot be that I shall never\r\nbehold a fellow being more!\xe2\x80\x94never! \xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x94not in the course of\r\nyears!\xe2\x80\x94Shall I wake, and speak to none, pass the interminable hours, my\r\nsoul, islanded in the world, a solitary point, surrounded by vacuum?\r\nWill day follow day endlessly thus? \xe2\x80\x94No! no! a God rules the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94providence has not exchanged its golden sceptre for an aspic\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsting. Away! let me fly from the ocean-grave, let me depart from this\r\nbarren nook, paled in, as it is, from access by its own desolateness;\r\nlet me tread once again the paved towns; step over the threshold of\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s dwellings, and most certainly I shall find this thought a\r\nhorrible vision\xe2\x80\x94a maddening, but evanescent dream.\r\n\r\nI entered Ravenna, (the town nearest to the spot whereon I had been\r\ncast), before the second sun had set on the empty world; I saw many\r\nliving creatures; oxen, and horses, and dogs, but there was no man\r\namong them; I entered a cottage, it was vacant; I ascended the marble\r\nstairs of a palace, the bats and the owls were nestled in the tapestry;\r\nI stepped softly, not to awaken the sleeping town: I rebuked a dog,\r\nthat by yelping disturbed the sacred stillness; I would not believe\r\nthat all was as it seemed\xe2\x80\x94The world was not dead, but I was mad; I was\r\ndeprived of sight, hearing, and sense of touch; I was labouring under\r\nthe force of a spell, which permitted me to behold all sights of earth,\r\nexcept its human inhabitants; they were pursuing their ordinary\r\nlabours. Every house had its inmate; but I could not perceive them. If\r\nI could have deluded myself into a belief of this kind, I should have\r\nbeen far more satisfied. But my brain, tenacious of its reason, refused\r\nto lend itself to such imaginations\xe2\x80\x94and though I endeavoured to play\r\nthe antic to myself, I knew that I, the offspring of man, during long\r\nyears one among many\xe2\x80\x94now remained sole survivor of my species.\r\n\r\nThe sun sank behind the western hills; I had fasted since the preceding\r\nevening, but, though faint and weary, I loathed food, nor ceased, while\r\nyet a ray of light remained, to pace the lonely streets. Night came on,\r\nand sent every living creature but me to the bosom of its mate. It was\r\nmy solace, to blunt my mental agony by personal hardship\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\nthousand beds around, I would not seek the luxury of one; I lay down on\r\nthe pavement,\xe2\x80\x94a cold marble step served me for a pillow\xe2\x80\x94midnight came;\r\nand then, though not before, did my wearied lids shut out the sight of\r\nthe twinkling stars, and their reflex on the pavement near. Thus I\r\npassed the second night of my desolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nI awoke in the morning, just as the higher windows of the lofty houses\r\nreceived the first beams of the rising sun. The birds were chirping,\r\nperched on the windows sills and deserted thresholds of the doors. I\r\nawoke, and my first thought was, Adrian and Clara are dead. I no longer\r\nshall be hailed by their good-morrow\xe2\x80\x94or pass the long day in their\r\nsociety. I shall never see them more. The ocean has robbed me of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94stolen their hearts of love from their breasts, and given over to\r\ncorruption what was dearer to me than light, or life, or hope.\r\n\r\nI was an untaught shepherd-boy, when Adrian deigned to confer on me his\r\nfriendship. The best years of my life had been passed with him. All I\r\nhad possessed of this world\xe2\x80\x99s goods, of happiness, knowledge, or\r\nvirtue\xe2\x80\x94I owed to him. He had, in his person, his intellect, and rare\r\nqualities, given a glory to my life, which without him it had never\r\nknown. Beyond all other beings he had taught me, that goodness, pure\r\nand single, can be an attribute of man. It was a sight for angels to\r\ncongregate to behold, to view him lead, govern, and solace, the last\r\ndays of the human race.\r\n\r\nMy lovely Clara also was lost to me\xe2\x80\x94she who last of the daughters of\r\nman, exhibited all those feminine and maiden virtues, which poets,\r\npainters, and sculptors, have in their various languages strove to\r\nexpress. Yet, as far as she was concerned, could I lament that she was\r\nremoved in early youth from the certain advent of misery? Pure she was\r\nof soul, and all her intents were holy. But her heart was the throne of\r\nlove, and the sensibility her lovely countenance expressed, was the\r\nprophet of many woes, not the less deep and drear, because she would\r\nhave for ever concealed them.\r\n\r\nThese two wondrously endowed beings had been spared from the universal\r\nwreck, to be my companions during the last year of solitude. I had\r\nfelt, while they were with me, all their worth. I was conscious that\r\nevery other sentiment, regret, or passion had by degrees merged into a\r\nyearning, clinging affection for them. I had not forgotten the sweet\r\npartner of my youth, mother of my children, my adored Idris; but I saw\r\nat least a part of her spirit alive again in her brother; and after,\r\nthat by Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s death I had lost what most dearly recalled her to me;\r\nI enshrined her memory in Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s form, and endeavoured to confound\r\nthe two dear ideas. I sound the depths of my heart, and try in vain to\r\ndraw thence the expressions that can typify my love for these remnants\r\nof my race. If regret and sorrow came athwart me, as well it might in\r\nour solitary and uncertain state, the clear tones of Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\r\nand his fervent look, dissipated the gloom; or I was cheered unaware by\r\nthe mild content and sweet resignation Clara\xe2\x80\x99s cloudless brow and deep\r\nblue eyes expressed. They were all to me\xe2\x80\x94the suns of my benighted\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x94repose in my weariness\xe2\x80\x94slumber in my sleepless woe. Ill, most ill,\r\nwith disjointed words, bare and weak, have I expressed the feeling with\r\nwhich I clung to them. I would have wound myself like ivy inextricably\r\nround them, so that the same blow might destroy us. I would have\r\nentered and been a part of them\xe2\x80\x94so that\r\n\r\nIf the dull substance of my flesh were thought,\r\n\r\n\r\neven now I had accompanied them to their new and incommunicable abode.\r\n\r\nNever shall I see them more. I am bereft of their dear converse\xe2\x80\x94bereft\r\nof sight of them. I am a tree rent by lightning; never will the bark\r\nclose over the bared fibres\xe2\x80\x94never will their quivering life, torn by\r\nthe winds, receive the opiate of a moment\xe2\x80\x99s balm. I am alone in the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94 but that expression as yet was less pregnant with misery, than\r\nthat Adrian and Clara are dead.\r\n\r\nThe tide of thought and feeling rolls on for ever the same, though the\r\nbanks and shapes around, which govern its course, and the reflection in\r\nthe wave, vary. Thus the sentiment of immediate loss in some sort\r\ndecayed, while that of utter, irremediable loneliness grew on me with\r\ntime. Three days I wandered through Ravenna\xe2\x80\x94now thinking only of the\r\nbeloved beings who slept in the oozy caves of ocean\xe2\x80\x94now looking forward\r\non the dread blank before me; shuddering to make an onward\r\nstep\xe2\x80\x94writhing at each change that marked the progress of the hours.\r\n\r\nFor three days I wandered to and fro in this melancholy town. I passed\r\nwhole hours in going from house to house, listening whether I could\r\ndetect some lurking sign of human existence. Sometimes I rang at a\r\nbell; it tinkled through the vaulted rooms, and silence succeeded to\r\nthe sound. I called myself hopeless, yet still I hoped; and still\r\ndisappointment ushered in the hours, intruding the cold, sharp steel\r\nwhich first pierced me, into the aching festering wound. I fed like a\r\nwild beast, which seizes its food only when stung by intolerable\r\nhunger. I did not change my garb, or seek the shelter of a roof, during\r\nall those days. Burning heats, nervous irritation, a ceaseless, but\r\nconfused flow of thought, sleepless nights, and days instinct with a\r\nfrenzy of agitation, possessed me during that time.\r\n\r\nAs the fever of my blood encreased, a desire of wandering came upon me.\r\nI remember, that the sun had set on the fifth day after my wreck, when,\r\nwithout purpose or aim, I quitted the town of Ravenna. I must have been\r\nvery ill. Had I been possessed by more or less of delirium, that night\r\nhad surely been my last; for, as I continued to walk on the banks of\r\nthe Mantone, whose upward course I followed, I looked wistfully on the\r\nstream, acknowledging to myself that its pellucid waves could medicine\r\nmy woes for ever, and was unable to account to myself for my tardiness\r\nin seeking their shelter from the poisoned arrows of thought, that were\r\npiercing me through and through. I walked a considerable part of the\r\nnight, and excessive weariness at length conquered my repugnance to the\r\navailing myself of the deserted habitations of my species. The waning\r\nmoon, which had just risen, shewed me a cottage, whose neat entrance\r\nand trim garden reminded me of my own England. I lifted up the latch of\r\nthe door and entered. A kitchen first presented itself, where, guided\r\nby the moon beams, I found materials for striking a light. Within this\r\nwas a bed room; the couch was furnished with sheets of snowy whiteness;\r\nthe wood piled on the hearth, and an array as for a meal, might almost\r\nhave deceived me into the dear belief that I had here found what I had\r\nso long sought\xe2\x80\x94one survivor, a companion for my loneliness, a solace to\r\nmy despair. I steeled myself against the delusion; the room itself was\r\nvacant: it was only prudent, I repeated to myself, to examine the rest\r\nof the house. I fancied that I was proof against the expectation; yet\r\nmy heart beat audibly, as I laid my hand on the lock of each door, and\r\nit sunk again, when I perceived in each the same vacancy. Dark and\r\nsilent they were as vaults; so I returned to the first chamber,\r\nwondering what sightless host had spread the materials for my repast,\r\nand my repose. I drew a chair to the table, and examined what the\r\nviands were of which I was to partake. In truth it was a death feast!\r\nThe bread was blue and mouldy; the cheese lay a heap of dust. I did not\r\ndare examine the other dishes; a troop of ants passed in a double line\r\nacross the table cloth; every utensil was covered with dust, with\r\ncobwebs, and myriads of dead flies: these were objects each and all\r\nbetokening the fallaciousness of my expectations. Tears rushed into my\r\neyes; surely this was a wanton display of the power of the destroyer.\r\nWhat had I done, that each sensitive nerve was thus to be anatomized?\r\nYet why complain more now than ever? This vacant cottage revealed no\r\nnew sorrow\xe2\x80\x94 the world was empty; mankind was dead\xe2\x80\x94I knew it well\xe2\x80\x94why\r\nquarrel therefore with an acknowledged and stale truth? Yet, as I said,\r\nI had hoped in the very heart of despair, so that every new impression\r\nof the hard-cut reality on my soul brought with it a fresh pang,\r\ntelling me the yet unstudied lesson, that neither change of place nor\r\ntime could bring alleviation to my misery, but that, as I now was, I\r\nmust continue, day after day, month after month, year after year, while\r\nI lived. I hardly dared conjecture what space of time that expression\r\nimplied. It is true, I was no longer in the first blush of manhood;\r\nneither had I declined far in the vale of years\xe2\x80\x94men have accounted mine\r\nthe prime of life: I had just entered my thirty-seventh year; every\r\nlimb was as well knit, every articulation as true, as when I had acted\r\nthe shepherd on the hills of Cumberland; and with these advantages I\r\nwas to commence the train of solitary life. Such were the reflections\r\nthat ushered in my slumber on that night.\r\n\r\nThe shelter, however, and less disturbed repose which I enjoyed,\r\nrestored me the following morning to a greater portion of health and\r\nstrength, than I had experienced since my fatal shipwreck. Among the\r\nstores I had discovered on searching the cottage the preceding night,\r\nwas a quantity of dried grapes; these refreshed me in the morning, as I\r\nleft my lodging and proceeded towards a town which I discerned at no\r\ngreat distance. As far as I could divine, it must have been Forli. I\r\nentered with pleasure its wide and grassy streets. All, it is true,\r\npictured the excess of desolation; yet I loved to find myself in those\r\nspots which had been the abode of my fellow creatures. I delighted to\r\ntraverse street after street, to look up at the tall houses, and repeat\r\nto myself, once they contained beings similar to myself\xe2\x80\x94I was not\r\nalways the wretch I am now. The wide square of Forli, the arcade around\r\nit, its light and pleasant aspect cheered me. I was pleased with the\r\nidea, that, if the earth should be again peopled, we, the lost race,\r\nwould, in the relics left behind, present no contemptible exhibition of\r\nour powers to the new comers.\r\n\r\nI entered one of the palaces, and opened the door of a magnificent\r\nsaloon. I started\xe2\x80\x94I looked again with renewed wonder. What\r\nwild-looking, unkempt, half-naked savage was that before me? The\r\nsurprise was momentary.\r\n\r\nI perceived that it was I myself whom I beheld in a large mirror at the\r\nend of the hall. No wonder that the lover of the princely Idris should\r\nfail to recognize himself in the miserable object there pourtrayed. My\r\ntattered dress was that in which I had crawled half alive from the\r\ntempestuous sea. My long and tangled hair hung in elf locks on my\r\nbrow\xe2\x80\x94my dark eyes, now hollow and wild, gleamed from under them\xe2\x80\x94my\r\ncheeks were discoloured by the jaundice, which (the effect of misery\r\nand neglect) suffused my skin, and were half hid by a beard of many\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 growth.\r\n\r\nYet why should I not remain thus, I thought; the world is dead, and\r\nthis squalid attire is a fitter mourning garb than the foppery of a\r\nblack suit. And thus, methinks, I should have remained, had not hope,\r\nwithout which I do not believe man could exist, whispered to me, that,\r\nin such a plight, I should be an object of fear and aversion to the\r\nbeing, preserved I knew not where, but I fondly trusted, at length, to\r\nbe found by me. Will my readers scorn the vanity, that made me attire\r\nmyself with some care, for the sake of this visionary being? Or will\r\nthey forgive the freaks of a half crazed imagination? I can easily\r\nforgive myself\xe2\x80\x94for hope, however vague, was so dear to me, and a\r\nsentiment of pleasure of so rare occurrence, that I yielded readily to\r\nany idea, that cherished the one, or promised any recurrence of the\r\nformer to my sorrowing heart. After such occupation, I visited every\r\nstreet, alley, and nook of Forli. These Italian towns presented an\r\nappearance of still greater desolation, than those of England or\r\nFrance. Plague had appeared here earlier\xe2\x80\x94it had finished its course,\r\nand achieved its work much sooner than with us. Probably the last\r\nsummer had found no human being alive, in all the track included\r\nbetween the shores of Calabria and the northern Alps. My search was\r\nutterly vain, yet I did not despond. Reason methought was on my side;\r\nand the chances were by no means contemptible, that there should exist\r\nin some part of Italy a survivor like myself\xe2\x80\x94of a wasted, depopulate\r\nland. As therefore I rambled through the empty town, I formed my plan\r\nfor future operations. I would continue to journey on towards Rome.\r\nAfter I should have satisfied myself, by a narrow search, that I left\r\nbehind no human being in the towns through which I passed, I would\r\nwrite up in a conspicuous part of each, with white paint, in three\r\nlanguages, that \xe2\x80\x9cVerney, the last of the race of Englishmen, had taken\r\nup his abode in Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this scheme, I entered a painter\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and procured\r\nmyself the paint. It is strange that so trivial an occupation should\r\nhave consoled, and even enlivened me. But grief renders one childish,\r\ndespair fantastic. To this simple inscription, I merely added the\r\nadjuration, \xe2\x80\x9cFriend, come! I wait for thee!\xe2\x80\x94_Deh, vieni! ti aspetto!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOn the following morning, with something like hope for my companion, I\r\nquitted Forli on my way to Rome. Until now, agonizing retrospect, and\r\ndreary prospects for the future, had stung me when awake, and cradled\r\nme to my repose. Many times I had delivered myself up to the tyranny of\r\nanguish\xe2\x80\x94 many times I resolved a speedy end to my woes; and death by my\r\nown hands was a remedy, whose practicability was even cheering to me.\r\nWhat could I fear in the other world? If there were an hell, and I were\r\ndoomed to it, I should come an adept to the sufferance of its\r\ntortures\xe2\x80\x94the act were easy, the speedy and certain end of my deplorable\r\ntragedy. But now these thoughts faded before the new born expectation.\r\nI went on my way, not as before, feeling each hour, each minute, to be\r\nan age instinct with incalculable pain.\r\n\r\nAs I wandered along the plain, at the foot of the Appennines\xe2\x80\x94through\r\ntheir vallies, and over their bleak summits, my path led me through a\r\ncountry which had been trodden by heroes, visited and admired by\r\nthousands. They had, as a tide, receded, leaving me blank and bare in\r\nthe midst. But why complain? Did I not hope?\xe2\x80\x94so I schooled myself, even\r\nafter the enlivening spirit had really deserted me, and thus I was\r\nobliged to call up all the fortitude I could command, and that was not\r\nmuch, to prevent a recurrence of that chaotic and intolerable despair,\r\nthat had succeeded to the miserable shipwreck, that had consummated\r\nevery fear, and dashed to annihilation every joy.\r\n\r\nI rose each day with the morning sun, and left my desolate inn. As my\r\nfeet strayed through the unpeopled country, my thoughts rambled through\r\nthe universe, and I was least miserable when I could, absorbed in\r\nreverie, forget the passage of the hours. Each evening, in spite of\r\nweariness, I detested to enter any dwelling, there to take up my\r\nnightly abode\xe2\x80\x94I have sat, hour after hour, at the door of the cottage I\r\nhad selected, unable to lift the latch, and meet face to face blank\r\ndesertion within. Many nights, though autumnal mists were spread\r\naround, I passed under an ilex\xe2\x80\x94many times I have supped on arbutus\r\nberries and chestnuts, making a fire, gypsy-like, on the ground\xe2\x80\x94because\r\nwild natural scenery reminded me less acutely of my hopeless state of\r\nloneliness. I counted the days, and bore with me a peeled willow-wand,\r\non which, as well as I could remember, I had notched the days that had\r\nelapsed since my wreck, and each night I added another unit to the\r\nmelancholy sum.\r\n\r\nI had toiled up a hill which led to Spoleto. Around was spread a plain,\r\nencircled by the chestnut-covered Appennines. A dark ravine was on one\r\nside, spanned by an aqueduct, whose tall arches were rooted in the dell\r\nbelow, and attested that man had once deigned to bestow labour and\r\nthought here, to adorn and civilize nature. Savage, ungrateful nature,\r\nwhich in wild sport defaced his remains, protruding her easily renewed,\r\nand fragile growth of wild flowers and parasite plants around his\r\neternal edifices. I sat on a fragment of rock, and looked round. The\r\nsun had bathed in gold the western atmosphere, and in the east the\r\nclouds caught the radiance, and budded into transient loveliness. It\r\nset on a world that contained me alone for its inhabitant. I took out\r\nmy wand\xe2\x80\x94I counted the marks. Twenty-five were already\r\ntraced\xe2\x80\x94twenty-five days had already elapsed, since human voice had\r\ngladdened my ears, or human countenance met my gaze. Twenty-five long,\r\nweary days, succeeded by dark and lonesome nights, had mingled with\r\nforegone years, and had become a part of the past\xe2\x80\x94the never to be\r\nrecalled\xe2\x80\x94a real, undeniable portion of my life\xe2\x80\x94twenty-five long, long\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nWhy this was not a month!\xe2\x80\x94Why talk of days\xe2\x80\x94or weeks\xe2\x80\x94or months\xe2\x80\x94I must\r\ngrasp years in my imagination, if I would truly picture the future to\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94three, five, ten, twenty, fifty anniversaries of that fatal\r\nepoch might elapse\xe2\x80\x94every year containing twelve months, each of more\r\nnumerous calculation in a diary, than the twenty-five days gone by\xe2\x80\x94Can\r\nit be? Will it be?\xe2\x80\x94We had been used to look forward to death\r\ntremulously\xe2\x80\x94 wherefore, but because its place was obscure? But more\r\nterrible, and far more obscure, was the unveiled course of my lone\r\nfuturity. I broke my wand; I threw it from me. I needed no recorder of\r\nthe inch and barley-corn growth of my life, while my unquiet thoughts\r\ncreated other divisions, than those ruled over by the planets\xe2\x80\x94and, in\r\nlooking back on the age that had elapsed since I had been alone, I\r\ndisdained to give the name of days and hours to the throes of agony\r\nwhich had in truth portioned it out.\r\n\r\nI hid my face in my hands. The twitter of the young birds going to\r\nrest, and their rustling among the trees, disturbed the still\r\nevening-air\xe2\x80\x94the crickets chirped\xe2\x80\x94the aziolo cooed at intervals. My\r\nthoughts had been of death\xe2\x80\x94these sounds spoke to me of life. I lifted\r\nup my eyes\xe2\x80\x94a bat wheeled round\xe2\x80\x94the sun had sunk behind the jagged line\r\nof mountains, and the paly, crescent moon was visible, silver white,\r\namidst the orange sunset, and accompanied by one bright star, prolonged\r\nthus the twilight. A herd of cattle passed along in the dell below,\r\nuntended, towards their watering place\xe2\x80\x94the grass was rustled by a\r\ngentle breeze, and the olive-woods, mellowed into soft masses by the\r\nmoonlight, contrasted their sea-green with the dark chestnut foliage.\r\nYes, this is the earth; there is no change\xe2\x80\x94no ruin\xe2\x80\x94no rent made in her\r\nverdurous expanse; she continues to wheel round and round, with\r\nalternate night and day, through the sky, though man is not her adorner\r\nor inhabitant. Why could I not forget myself like one of those animals,\r\nand no longer suffer the wild tumult of misery that I endure? Yet, ah!\r\nwhat a deadly breach yawns between their state and mine! Have not they\r\ncompanions? Have not they each their mate\xe2\x80\x94their cherished young, their\r\nhome, which, though unexpressed to us, is, I doubt not, endeared and\r\nenriched, even in their eyes, by the society which kind nature has\r\ncreated for them? It is I only that am alone\xe2\x80\x94I, on this little hill\r\ntop, gazing on plain and mountain recess\xe2\x80\x94on sky, and its starry\r\npopulation, listening to every sound of earth, and air, and murmuring\r\nwave,\xe2\x80\x94I only cannot express to any companion my many thoughts, nor lay\r\nmy throbbing head on any loved bosom, nor drink from meeting eyes an\r\nintoxicating dew, that transcends the fabulous nectar of the gods.\r\nShall I not then complain? Shall I not curse the murderous engine which\r\nhas mowed down the children of men, my brethren? Shall I not bestow a\r\nmalediction on every other of nature\xe2\x80\x99s offspring, which dares live and\r\nenjoy, while I live and suffer?\r\n\r\nAh, no! I will discipline my sorrowing heart to sympathy in your joys;\r\nI will be happy, because ye are so. Live on, ye innocents, nature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nselected darlings; I am not much unlike to you. Nerves, pulse, brain,\r\njoint, and flesh, of such am I composed, and ye are organized by the\r\nsame laws. I have something beyond this, but I will call it a defect,\r\nnot an endowment, if it leads me to misery, while ye are happy. Just\r\nthen, there emerged from a near copse two goats and a little kid, by\r\nthe mother\xe2\x80\x99s side; they began to browze the herbage of the hill. I\r\napproached near to them, without their perceiving me; I gathered a\r\nhandful of fresh grass, and held it out; the little one nestled close\r\nto its mother, while she timidly withdrew. The male stepped forward,\r\nfixing his eyes on me: I drew near, still holding out my lure, while\r\nhe, depressing his head, rushed at me with his horns. I was a very\r\nfool; I knew it, yet I yielded to my rage. I snatched up a huge\r\nfragment of rock; it would have crushed my rash foe. I poized it\xe2\x80\x94aimed\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94then my heart failed me. I hurled it wide of the mark; it rolled\r\nclattering among the bushes into dell. My little visitants, all aghast,\r\ngalloped back into the covert of the wood; while I, my very heart\r\nbleeding and torn, rushed down the hill, and by the violence of bodily\r\nexertion, sought to escape from my miserable self.\r\n\r\nNo, no, I will not live among the wild scenes of nature, the enemy of\r\nall that lives. I will seek the towns\xe2\x80\x94Rome, the capital of the world,\r\nthe crown of man\xe2\x80\x99s achievements. Among its storied streets, hallowed\r\nruins, and stupendous remains of human exertion, I shall not, as here,\r\nfind every thing forgetful of man; trampling on his memory, defacing\r\nhis works, proclaiming from hill to hill, and vale to vale,\xe2\x80\x94by the\r\ntorrents freed from the boundaries which he imposed\xe2\x80\x94by the vegetation\r\nliberated from the laws which he enforced\xe2\x80\x94by his habitation abandoned\r\nto mildew and weeds, that his power is lost, his race annihilated for\r\never.\r\n\r\nI hailed the Tiber, for that was as it were an unalienable possession\r\nof humanity. I hailed the wild Campagna, for every rood had been trod\r\nby man; and its savage uncultivation, of no recent date, only\r\nproclaimed more distinctly his power, since he had given an honourable\r\nname and sacred title to what else would have been a worthless, barren\r\ntrack. I entered Eternal Rome by the Porta del Popolo, and saluted with\r\nawe its time-honoured space. The wide square, the churches near, the\r\nlong extent of the Corso, the near eminence of Trinita de\xe2\x80\x99 Monti\r\nappeared like fairy work, they were so silent, so peaceful, and so very\r\nfair. It was evening; and the population of animals which still existed\r\nin this mighty city, had gone to rest; there was no sound, save the\r\nmurmur of its many fountains, whose soft monotony was harmony to my\r\nsoul. The knowledge that I was in Rome, soothed me; that wondrous city,\r\nhardly more illustrious for its heroes and sages, than for the power it\r\nexercised over the imaginations of men. I went to rest that night; the\r\neternal burning of my heart quenched,\xe2\x80\x94my senses tranquil.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I eagerly began my rambles in search of oblivion. I\r\nascended the many terraces of the garden of the Colonna Palace, under\r\nwhose roof I had been sleeping; and passing out from it at its summit,\r\nI found myself on Monte Cavallo. The fountain sparkled in the sun; the\r\nobelisk above pierced the clear dark-blue air. The statues on each\r\nside, the works, as they are inscribed, of Phidias and Praxiteles,\r\nstood in undiminished grandeur, representing Castor and Pollux, who\r\nwith majestic power tamed the rearing animal at their side. If those\r\nillustrious artists had in truth chiselled these forms, how many\r\npassing generations had their giant proportions outlived! and now they\r\nwere viewed by the last of the species they were sculptured to\r\nrepresent and deify. I had shrunk into insignificance in my own eyes,\r\nas I considered the multitudinous beings these stone demigods had\r\noutlived, but this after-thought restored me to dignity in my own\r\nconception. The sight of the poetry eternized in these statues, took\r\nthe sting from the thought, arraying it only in poetic ideality.\r\n\r\nI repeated to myself,\xe2\x80\x94I am in Rome! I behold, and as it were,\r\nfamiliarly converse with the wonder of the world, sovereign mistress of\r\nthe imagination, majestic and eternal survivor of millions of\r\ngenerations of extinct men. I endeavoured to quiet the sorrows of my\r\naching heart, by even now taking an interest in what in my youth I had\r\nardently longed to see. Every part of Rome is replete with relics of\r\nancient times. The meanest streets are strewed with truncated columns,\r\nbroken capitals\xe2\x80\x94Corinthian and Ionic, and sparkling fragments of\r\ngranite or porphyry. The walls of the most penurious dwellings enclose\r\na fluted pillar or ponderous stone, which once made part of the palace\r\nof the C\xc3\xa6sars; and the voice of dead time, in still vibrations, is\r\nbreathed from these dumb things, animated and glorified as they were by\r\nman.\r\n\r\nI embraced the vast columns of the temple of Jupiter Stator, which\r\nsurvives in the open space that was the Forum, and leaning my burning\r\ncheek against its cold durability, I tried to lose the sense of present\r\nmisery and present desertion, by recalling to the haunted cell of my\r\nbrain vivid memories of times gone by. I rejoiced at my success, as I\r\nfigured Camillus, the Gracchi, Cato, and last the heroes of Tacitus,\r\nwhich shine meteors of surpassing brightness during the murky night of\r\nthe empire;\xe2\x80\x94as the verses of Horace and Virgil, or the glowing periods\r\nof Cicero thronged into the opened gates of my mind, I felt myself\r\nexalted by long forgotten enthusiasm. I was delighted to know that I\r\nbeheld the scene which they beheld\xe2\x80\x94the scene which their wives and\r\nmothers, and crowds of the unnamed witnessed, while at the same time\r\nthey honoured, applauded, or wept for these matchless specimens of\r\nhumanity. At length, then, I had found a consolation. I had not vainly\r\nsought the storied precincts of Rome\xe2\x80\x94I had discovered a medicine for my\r\nmany and vital wounds.\r\n\r\nI sat at the foot of these vast columns. The Coliseum, whose naked ruin\r\nis robed by nature in a verdurous and glowing veil, lay in the sunlight\r\non my right. Not far off, to the left, was the Tower of the Capitol.\r\nTriumphal arches, the falling walls of many temples, strewed the ground\r\nat my feet. I strove, I resolved, to force myself to see the Plebeian\r\nmultitude and lofty Patrician forms congregated around; and, as the\r\nDiorama of ages passed across my subdued fancy, they were replaced by\r\nthe modern Roman; the Pope, in his white stole, distributing\r\nbenedictions to the kneeling worshippers; the friar in his cowl; the\r\ndark-eyed girl, veiled by her mezzera; the noisy, sun-burnt rustic,\r\nleading his herd of buffaloes and oxen to the Campo Vaccino. The\r\nromance with which, dipping our pencils in the rainbow hues of sky and\r\ntranscendent nature, we to a degree gratuitously endow the Italians,\r\nreplaced the solemn grandeur of antiquity. I remembered the dark monk,\r\nand floating figures of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Italian,\xe2\x80\x9d and how my boyish blood had\r\nthrilled at the description. I called to mind Corinna ascending the\r\nCapitol to be crowned, and, passing from the heroine to the author,\r\nreflected how the Enchantress Spirit of Rome held sovereign sway over\r\nthe minds of the imaginative, until it rested on me\xe2\x80\x94sole remaining\r\nspectator of its wonders.\r\n\r\nI was long wrapt by such ideas; but the soul wearies of a pauseless\r\nflight; and, stooping from its wheeling circuits round and round this\r\nspot, suddenly it fell ten thousand fathom deep, into the abyss of the\r\npresent\xe2\x80\x94 into self-knowledge\xe2\x80\x94into tenfold sadness. I roused myself\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncast off my waking dreams; and I, who just now could almost hear the\r\nshouts of the Roman throng, and was hustled by countless multitudes,\r\nnow beheld the desart ruins of Rome sleeping under its own blue sky;\r\nthe shadows lay tranquilly on the ground; sheep were grazing untended\r\non the Palatine, and a buffalo stalked down the Sacred Way that led to\r\nthe Capitol. I was alone in the Forum; alone in Rome; alone in the\r\nworld. Would not one living man \xe2\x80\x94one companion in my weary solitude, be\r\nworth all the glory and remembered power of this time-honoured city?\r\nDouble sorrow\xe2\x80\x94sadness, bred in Cimmerian caves, robed my soul in a\r\nmourning garb. The generations I had conjured up to my fancy,\r\ncontrasted more strongly with the end of all \xe2\x80\x94the single point in\r\nwhich, as a pyramid, the mighty fabric of society had ended, while I,\r\non the giddy height, saw vacant space around me.\r\n\r\nFrom such vague laments I turned to the contemplation of the minutiae\r\nof my situation. So far, I had not succeeded in the sole object of my\r\ndesires, the finding a companion for my desolation. Yet I did not\r\ndespair. It is true that my inscriptions were set up for the most part,\r\nin insignificant towns and villages; yet, even without these memorials,\r\nit was possible that the person, who like me should find himself alone\r\nin a depopulate land, should, like me, come to Rome. The more slender\r\nmy expectation was, the more I chose to build on it, and to accommodate\r\nmy actions to this vague possibility.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary therefore, that for a time I should domesticate\r\nmyself at Rome. It became necessary, that I should look my disaster in\r\nthe face\xe2\x80\x94 not playing the school-boy\xe2\x80\x99s part of obedience without\r\nsubmission; enduring life, and yet rebelling against the laws by which\r\nI lived.\r\n\r\nYet how could I resign myself? Without love, without sympathy, without\r\ncommunion with any, how could I meet the morning sun, and with it trace\r\nits oft repeated journey to the evening shades? Why did I continue to\r\nlive\xe2\x80\x94 why not throw off the weary weight of time, and with my own hand,\r\nlet out the fluttering prisoner from my agonized breast?\xe2\x80\x94It was not\r\ncowardice that withheld me; for the true fortitude was to endure; and\r\ndeath had a soothing sound accompanying it, that would easily entice me\r\nto enter its demesne. But this I would not do. I had, from the moment I\r\nhad reasoned on the subject, instituted myself the subject to fate, and\r\nthe servant of necessity, the visible laws of the invisible God\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieved that my obedience was the result of sound reasoning, pure\r\nfeeling, and an exalted sense of the true excellence and nobility of my\r\nnature. Could I have seen in this empty earth, in the seasons and their\r\nchange, the hand of a blind power only, most willingly would I have\r\nplaced my head on the sod, and closed my eyes on its loveliness for\r\never. But fate had administered life to me, when the plague had already\r\nseized on its prey\xe2\x80\x94she had dragged me by the hair from out the\r\nstrangling waves\xe2\x80\x94By such miracles she had bought me for her own; I\r\nadmitted her authority, and bowed to her decrees. If, after mature\r\nconsideration, such was my resolve, it was doubly necessary that I\r\nshould not lose the end of life, the improvement of my faculties, and\r\npoison its flow by repinings without end. Yet how cease to repine,\r\nsince there was no hand near to extract the barbed spear that had\r\nentered my heart of hearts? I stretched out my hand, and it touched\r\nnone whose sensations were responsive to mine. I was girded, walled in,\r\nvaulted over, by seven-fold barriers of loneliness. Occupation alone,\r\nif I could deliver myself up to it, would be capable of affording an\r\nopiate to my sleepless sense of woe. Having determined to make Rome my\r\nabode, at least for some months, I made arrangements for my\r\naccommodation\xe2\x80\x94I selected my home. The Colonna Palace was well adapted\r\nfor my purpose. Its grandeur\xe2\x80\x94 its treasure of paintings, its\r\nmagnificent halls were objects soothing and even exhilarating.\r\n\r\nI found the granaries of Rome well stored with grain, and particularly\r\nwith Indian corn; this product requiring less art in its preparation\r\nfor food, I selected as my principal support. I now found the hardships\r\nand lawlessness of my youth turn to account. A man cannot throw off the\r\nhabits of sixteen years. Since that age, it is true, I had lived\r\nluxuriously, or at least surrounded by all the conveniences\r\ncivilization afforded. But before that time, I had been \xe2\x80\x9cas uncouth a\r\nsavage, as the wolf-bred founder of old Rome\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and now, in Rome itself,\r\nrobber and shepherd propensities, similar to those of its founder, were\r\nof advantage to its sole inhabitant. I spent the morning riding and\r\nshooting in the Campagna\xe2\x80\x94I passed long hours in the various galleries\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ngazed at each statue, and lost myself in a reverie before many a fair\r\nMadonna or beauteous nymph. I haunted the Vatican, and stood surrounded\r\nby marble forms of divine beauty. Each stone deity was possessed by\r\nsacred gladness, and the eternal fruition of love. They looked on me\r\nwith unsympathizing complacency, and often in wild accents I reproached\r\nthem for their supreme indifference\xe2\x80\x94for they were human shapes, the\r\nhuman form divine was manifest in each fairest limb and lineament. The\r\nperfect moulding brought with it the idea of colour and motion; often,\r\nhalf in bitter mockery, half in self-delusion, I clasped their icy\r\nproportions, and, coming between Cupid and his Psyche\xe2\x80\x99s lips, pressed\r\nthe unconceiving marble.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to read. I visited the libraries of Rome. I selected a\r\nvolume, and, choosing some sequestered, shady nook, on the banks of the\r\nTiber, or opposite the fair temple in the Borghese Gardens, or under\r\nthe old pyramid of Cestius, I endeavoured to conceal me from myself,\r\nand immerse myself in the subject traced on the pages before me. As if\r\nin the same soil you plant nightshade and a myrtle tree, they will each\r\nappropriate the mould, moisture, and air administered, for the\r\nfostering their several properties\xe2\x80\x94so did my grief find sustenance, and\r\npower of existence, and growth, in what else had been divine manna, to\r\nfeed radiant meditation. Ah! while I streak this paper with the tale of\r\nwhat my so named occupations were\xe2\x80\x94while I shape the skeleton of my\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x94my hand trembles\xe2\x80\x94my heart pants, and my brain refuses to lend\r\nexpression, or phrase, or idea, by which to image forth the veil of\r\nunutterable woe that clothed these bare realities. O, worn and beating\r\nheart, may I dissect thy fibres, and tell how in each unmitigable\r\nmisery, sadness dire, repinings, and despair, existed? May I record my\r\nmany ravings\xe2\x80\x94the wild curses I hurled at torturing nature\xe2\x80\x94and how I\r\nhave passed days shut out from light and food\xe2\x80\x94from all except the\r\nburning hell alive in my own bosom?\r\n\r\nI was presented, meantime, with one other occupation, the one best\r\nfitted to discipline my melancholy thoughts, which strayed backwards,\r\nover many a ruin, and through many a flowery glade, even to the\r\nmountain recess, from which in early youth I had first emerged.\r\n\r\nDuring one of my rambles through the habitations of Rome, I found\r\nwriting materials on a table in an author\xe2\x80\x99s study. Parts of a\r\nmanuscript lay scattered about. It contained a learned disquisition on\r\nthe Italian language; one page an unfinished dedication to posterity,\r\nfor whose profit the writer had sifted and selected the niceties of\r\nthis harmonious language \xe2\x80\x94to whose everlasting benefit he bequeathed\r\nhis labours.\r\n\r\nI also will write a book, I cried\xe2\x80\x94for whom to read?\xe2\x80\x94to whom dedicated?\r\nAnd then with silly flourish (what so capricious and childish as\r\ndespair?) I wrote,\r\n\r\nDEDICATION\r\nTO THE ILLUSTRIOUS DEAD.\r\nSHADOWS, ARISE, AND READ YOUR FALL!\r\nBEHOLD THE HISTORY OF THE\r\nLAST MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, will not this world be re-peopled, and the children of a saved\r\npair of lovers, in some to me unknown and unattainable seclusion,\r\nwandering to these prodigious relics of the ante-pestilential race,\r\nseek to learn how beings so wondrous in their achievements, with\r\nimaginations infinite, and powers godlike, had departed from their home\r\nto an unknown country?\r\n\r\nI will write and leave in this most ancient city, this \xe2\x80\x9cworld\xe2\x80\x99s sole\r\nmonument,\xe2\x80\x9d a record of these things. I will leave a monument of the\r\nexistence of Verney, the Last Man. At first I thought only to speak of\r\nplague, of death, and last, of desertion; but I lingered fondly on my\r\nearly years, and recorded with sacred zeal the virtues of my\r\ncompanions. They have been with me during the fulfilment of my task. I\r\nhave brought it to an end\xe2\x80\x94I lift my eyes from my paper\xe2\x80\x94again they are\r\nlost to me. Again I feel that I am alone.\r\n\r\nA year has passed since I have been thus occupied. The seasons have\r\nmade their wonted round, and decked this eternal city in a changeful\r\nrobe of surpassing beauty. A year has passed; and I no longer _guess_\r\nat my state or my prospects\xe2\x80\x94loneliness is my familiar, sorrow my\r\ninseparable companion. I have endeavoured to brave the storm\xe2\x80\x94I have\r\nendeavoured to school myself to fortitude\xe2\x80\x94I have sought to imbue myself\r\nwith the lessons of wisdom. It will not do. My hair has become nearly\r\ngrey\xe2\x80\x94my voice, unused now to utter sound, comes strangely on my ears.\r\nMy person, with its human powers and features, seem to me a monstrous\r\nexcrescence of nature. How express in human language a woe human being\r\nuntil this hour never knew! How give intelligible expression to a pang\r\nnone but I could ever understand!\xe2\x80\x94 No one has entered Rome. None will\r\never come. I smile bitterly at the delusion I have so long nourished,\r\nand still more, when I reflect that I have exchanged it for another as\r\ndelusive, as false, but to which I now cling with the same fond trust.\r\n\r\nWinter has come again; and the gardens of Rome have lost their leaves\xe2\x80\x94\r\nthe sharp air comes over the Campagna, and has driven its brute\r\ninhabitants to take up their abode in the many dwellings of the\r\ndeserted city\xe2\x80\x94frost has suspended the gushing fountains\xe2\x80\x94and Trevi has\r\nstilled her eternal music. I had made a rough calculation, aided by the\r\nstars, by which I endeavoured to ascertain the first day of the new\r\nyear. In the old out-worn age, the Sovereign Pontiff was used to go in\r\nsolemn pomp, and mark the renewal of the year by driving a nail in the\r\ngate of the temple of Janus. On that day I ascended St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\ncarved on its topmost stone the aera 2100, last year of the world!\r\n\r\nMy only companion was a dog, a shaggy fellow, half water and half\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s dog, whom I found tending sheep in the Campagna. His master\r\nwas dead, but nevertheless he continued fulfilling his duties in\r\nexpectation of his return. If a sheep strayed from the rest, he forced\r\nit to return to the flock, and sedulously kept off every intruder.\r\nRiding in the Campagna I had come upon his sheep-walk, and for some\r\ntime observed his repetition of lessons learned from man, now useless,\r\nthough unforgotten. His delight was excessive when he saw me. He sprung\r\nup to my knees; he capered round and round, wagging his tail, with the\r\nshort, quick bark of pleasure: he left his fold to follow me, and from\r\nthat day has never neglected to watch by and attend on me, shewing\r\nboisterous gratitude whenever I caressed or talked to him. His\r\npattering steps and mine alone were heard, when we entered the\r\nmagnificent extent of nave and aisle of St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s. We ascended the\r\nmyriad steps together, when on the summit I achieved my design, and in\r\nrough figures noted the date of the last year. I then turned to gaze on\r\nthe country, and to take leave of Rome. I had long determined to quit\r\nit, and I now formed the plan I would adopt for my future career, after\r\nI had left this magnificent abode.\r\n\r\nA solitary being is by instinct a wanderer, and that I would become. A\r\nhope of amelioration always attends on change of place, which would\r\neven lighten the burthen of my life. I had been a fool to remain in\r\nRome all this time: Rome noted for Malaria, the famous caterer for\r\ndeath. But it was still possible, that, could I visit the whole extent\r\nof earth, I should find in some part of the wide extent a survivor.\r\nMethought the sea-side was the most probable retreat to be chosen by\r\nsuch a one. If left alone in an inland district, still they could not\r\ncontinue in the spot where their last hopes had been extinguished; they\r\nwould journey on, like me, in search of a partner for their solitude,\r\ntill the watery barrier stopped their further progress.\r\n\r\nTo that water\xe2\x80\x94cause of my woes, perhaps now to be their cure, I would\r\nbetake myself. Farewell, Italy!\xe2\x80\x94farewell, thou ornament of the world,\r\nmatchless Rome, the retreat of the solitary one during long months!\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ncivilized life\xe2\x80\x94to the settled home and succession of monotonous days,\r\nfarewell! Peril will now be mine; and I hail her as a friend\xe2\x80\x94death will\r\nperpetually cross my path, and I will meet him as a benefactor;\r\nhardship, inclement weather, and dangerous tempests will be my sworn\r\nmates. Ye spirits of storm, receive me! ye powers of destruction, open\r\nwide your arms, and clasp me for ever! if a kinder power have not\r\ndecreed another end, so that after long endurance I may reap my reward,\r\nand again feel my heart beat near the heart of another like to me.\r\n\r\nTiber, the road which is spread by nature\xe2\x80\x99s own hand, threading her\r\ncontinent, was at my feet, and many a boat was tethered to the banks. I\r\nwould with a few books, provisions, and my dog, embark in one of these\r\nand float down the current of the stream into the sea; and then,\r\nkeeping near land, I would coast the beauteous shores and sunny\r\npromontories of the blue Mediterranean, pass Naples, along Calabria,\r\nand would dare the twin perils of Scylla and Charybdis; then, with\r\nfearless aim, (for what had I to lose?) skim ocean\xe2\x80\x99s surface towards\r\nMalta and the further Cyclades. I would avoid Constantinople, the sight\r\nof whose well-known towers and inlets belonged to another state of\r\nexistence from my present one; I would coast Asia Minor, and Syria,\r\nand, passing the seven-mouthed Nile, steer northward again, till losing\r\nsight of forgotten Carthage and deserted Lybia, I should reach the\r\npillars of Hercules. And then\xe2\x80\x94no matter where\xe2\x80\x94the oozy caves, and\r\nsoundless depths of ocean may be my dwelling, before I accomplish this\r\nlong-drawn voyage, or the arrow of disease find my heart as I float\r\nsingly on the weltering Mediterranean; or, in some place I touch at, I\r\nmay find what I seek\xe2\x80\x94a companion; or if this may not be\xe2\x80\x94to endless\r\ntime, decrepid and grey headed\xe2\x80\x94youth already in the grave with those I\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94 the lone wanderer will still unfurl his sail, and clasp the\r\ntiller\xe2\x80\x94and, still obeying the breezes of heaven, for ever round another\r\nand another promontory, anchoring in another and another bay, still\r\nploughing seedless ocean, leaving behind the verdant land of native\r\nEurope, adown the tawny shore of Africa, having weathered the fierce\r\nseas of the Cape, I may moor my worn skiff in a creek, shaded by spicy\r\ngroves of the odorous islands of the far Indian ocean.\r\n\r\nThese are wild dreams. Yet since, now a week ago, they came on me, as I\r\nstood on the height of St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s, they have ruled my imagination. I\r\nhave chosen my boat, and laid in my scant stores. I have selected a few\r\nbooks; the principal are Homer and Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x94But the libraries of the\r\nworld are thrown open to me\xe2\x80\x94and in any port I can renew my stock. I\r\nform no expectation of alteration for the better; but the monotonous\r\npresent is intolerable to me.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
